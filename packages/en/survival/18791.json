Early imbued with a desire to understand the _causes_ of\r\nnatural phenomena, the author devoured with avidity the interpretations\r\ncontained in the elementary works of orthodox science, until reason and\r\nobservation rendered him dissatisfied with the repast. To him it\r\nappeared that there was an evident tendency in scholastic instruction,\r\nto make the knowledge of nature inaccessible to the many, that the world\r\nmight be made more dependent on the few; while many of the _established\r\nprinciples_, on which the learned rested, seemed to be at variance with\r\nthe simplicity and consistency of truth. Thus situated, he ventured to\r\nthink for himself, and looking back on the history of the past, and\r\nfinding so many cases in which the philosophy of to-day was supplanted\r\nby a different system on the morrow, he was led to suspect the\r\npossibility of future revolutions, and was thus determined to be no\r\nlonger embarrassed by previous systems, nor deterred by opinions\r\nhowever learned, which conflicted with a rational recognition of the\r\nmechanical nature of all physical phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe science of meteorology, to which the following pages are devoted,\r\nis, and always has been, a confessedly complex subject; and on this\r\naccount, any suggestions and facts which observation gleans,--no matter\r\nhow humble the source may be, should not be denied a hearing by those\r\nprofessedly engaged in the pursuit of truth. Step by step, the author\r\nbecame more and more confirmed in his doubts of the soundness of many\r\nmodern theories; and in 1838 he had attained a position which enabled\r\nhim to allege in the public prints of the day, that there did exist\r\ncertain erroneous dogmas in the schools, which stood in the way of a\r\nfuller development of the causes of many meteorological phenomena. This\r\nannunciation was made in general terms, and no notice was taken of it.\r\nSubsequently, he forwarded to the British Association of Science, then\r\nconvened at Birmingham, a communication of similar tenor; and at a later\r\ndate still, a more particular statement of the advantages of his\r\ndiscoveries to the navigator and agriculturist, was sent to the British\r\nadmiralty. The first of these communications was treated with silent\r\ncontempt; the last elicited some unimportant reply. In 1844 a memorial\r\nwas presented to Congress, accompanied with a certified copy of\r\n_predictions_ of the weather, written several weeks before the event,\r\nand attested in due form by two impartial witnesses; but neither did\r\nthis result in any inquiry as to its truth. During the time since\r\nelapsed, he has been engaged in pursuits which prevented him from\r\npressing the subject elsewhere, until the spring of 1853, he brought\r\nhis theory under the notice of the Smithsonian Institution. This led to\r\na correspondence between himself and the gentlemanly Secretary of the\r\nInstitution, whose doubts of the truth of his allegations were expressed\r\nwith kindness, and whose courtesy was in strange contrast with the\r\nconduct of others. In the communications which he forwarded to that\r\nInstitution, he gave a detailed statement of the difficulties he had met\r\nwith, and expressed the hope that an Institution, created for the\r\npurpose of increasing and diffusing knowledge, would feel justified in\r\nlending the influence of its name to facilitate the completion of a\r\ntheory which was yet undeniably imperfect. In view of this, a test was\r\nproposed.[1] \"Give us, for example, a prediction of the weather for one\r\nmonth in each season of the year 1854, for the City of Washington.\" This\r\ntest the author refused, for the reason that he did not consider it\r\nnecessary to wait so long; but he informed the Secretary of the\r\nInstitution, that he would prepare an outline of his theory, which would\r\nenable him to decide upon the merits of the discoveries claimed. This\r\noutline is contained in the following pages. During the summer of 1853\r\nhe called upon Professor Henry, then at Chicago, with his manuscript;\r\nbut a sudden indisposition prevented that gentleman from having it read.\r\nHe, however, strongly recommended its publication from such impressions\r\nhe then received.[2] This the author had resolved on, from a sense of\r\nduty to the world at large, although the promise was rather of\r\nprospective loss than of present benefit. The peculiar form under which\r\nthe theory appears, is, therefore, a result of the circumstances above\r\nstated, and of the author's present inability to enter into the minute\r\ndetails of a subject, which embraces in its range the whole visible\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nIn extending the theory to other phenomena, he has only fearlessly\r\nfollowed out the same principles which have conducted him to a knowledge\r\nof a disturbing cause, to which atmospheric storms owe their origin, and\r\nin doing so he has conferred with no one. For whatever of merit or of\r\nblame may therefore justly attach to these views, he alone is\r\nresponsible. If he has charged the scientific with inconsistency, or\r\nwith sometimes forgetting that the truth of their unnecessarily abstruse\r\ninvestigations depends on the truth of the data, he at least is\r\nconscientious; for he is too well aware that to provoke an unfavorable\r\nverdict by contending against such fearful odds, is not the surest way\r\nto either wealth or fame, or even to an acknowledgment of at least _the\r\nmite_, which he cannot but feel that he has contributed to the treasury\r\nof knowledge. That the scientific organisations of the day do tend to\r\ncurb the aberrations of a fanciful philosophy, cannot be denied; but at\r\nthe same time there is engendered such a slavish subordination as checks\r\nthe originality of thought, and destroys that perfect freedom from the\r\ntrammels of system, so necessary to success in the pursuit of truth. Of\r\nsuch an influence the author explicitly asserts his entire independence.\r\n\r\nIn thus introducing his theory, the reader is forewarned that he will\r\nnot find it dressed in the fascinating garb of the popular literature of\r\nthe day, whose chief characteristic is to promise much when possessing\r\nlittle. It is, however, a plant of the author's own raising, unpropped,\r\nunpruned, with none of the delicate tendrils or graceful festoons of the\r\ntrellissed vine; yet he flatters himself that its roots are watered by\r\nthe springs of truth, and hopes that he who is in quest of _that_, will\r\nnot find, amidst its many clusters, any fruit to set his teeth on\r\nedge.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Extract from a letter from Professor Henry.\r\n\r\n[2] This gentleman kindly offered to contribute from his own private\r\nmeans, to forward the publication, but he could do nothing officially\r\nwithout submitting the manuscript to three different censors. He who\r\nclaims a new discovery, will seldom be satisfied to have it judged by\r\nmen who are engaged in the same investigations, however pure and\r\nhonorable they may be. Is this Institution adopting the best plan of\r\naiding truth, in its struggles against error? Should any man sit as\r\njudge in his own trial? If there had been a powerful Institution to\r\nstand between Galileo and the scientific of his day, his doctrines would\r\nnot have been condemned, and the world would have been fifty years more\r\nin advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL THEORY OF STORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENT STATE OF METEOROLOGY.\r\n\r\nThe present state of the science of which we are about to treat, cannot\r\nbe better defined than in the words of the celebrated Humboldt, who has\r\ndevoted a long life to the investigation of this department of Physics.\r\nHe says: \"The processes of the absorption of light, the liberation of\r\nheat, and the variations in the elastic and electric tension, and in the\r\nhygrometric condition of the vast aerial ocean, are all so intimately\r\nconnected together, that each individual meteorological process is\r\nmodified by the action of all the others. The complicated nature of\r\nthese disturbing causes, increases the difficulty of giving a full\r\nexplanation of these involved meteorological phenomena; and likewise\r\nlimits, or _wholly precludes_ the possibility of that predetermination\r\nof atmospheric changes, which would be so important for horticulture,\r\nagriculture, and navigation, no less than for the comfort and enjoyment\r\nof life. Those who place the value of meteorology in this problematic\r\nspecies of prediction, rather than in the knowledge of the phenomena\r\nthemselves, are firmly convinced that this branch of science, on account\r\nof which so many expeditions to distant mountainous regions have been\r\nundertaken, has not made any very considerable progress for centuries\r\npast. The confidence which they refuse to the physicist they yield to\r\nchanges of the moon, and to certain days marked in the calender by the\r\nsuperstition of a by-gone age.\"\r\n\r\nThe charge thus skilfully repelled, contains, however, much truth; there\r\nhas been no adequate return of the vast amount of labor and expense thus\r\nfar devoted to this branch of knowledge. And it is not wonderful that\r\nthe popular mind should expect a result which is so much in accordance\r\nwith the wants of mankind. Who is there whose happiness, and health, and\r\ncomfort, _and_ safety, and prosperity, may not be more or less affected\r\nby reducing to law, the apparently irregular fluctuations of the\r\nweather, and the predetermination of the storm? To do this would be the\r\ncrowning triumph of the age; and the present theory has pioneered the\r\nway for its speedy accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL CONDITION OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\nThat the present order of things had a beginning, is taught by every\r\nanalogy around us, and as we have the glaring fact forced upon us, that\r\nour globe has experienced a far higher temperature on its surface than\r\nobtains at present, and moreover, as it is demonstrated beyond a cavil,\r\nthat the interior is now of far higher temperature than is due to solar\r\nradiation, we are justified in concluding, not only that the condition\r\nof the interior of our globe is that of fusion, but that its original\r\ntemperature was far higher than at present; so that the inference is\r\nallowable that there has been a time when the whole globe was _perhaps_\r\nin this state. But why should we stop here? There are three states of\r\nmatter, the solid, the fluid, and the gaseous; and with this passing\r\nglance at the question, we will jump at once to the theory of La\r\nPlace,--that not only our own globe, but the whole solar system, has\r\nbeen once in the nebulous state.\r\n\r\nIn justice to himself, the author ought to remark, that he had reasoned\r\nhis way up to this starting point, before even the name of La Place had\r\nreached his ears. He makes the remark in order to disclaim any desire to\r\nappropriate that which belongs to another; as he may innocently speak of\r\nthings hereafter, the idea of which has occurred to others. It is not\r\nhis intention here to say a word _pro_ or _con_ on the nebular\r\nhypothesis; it is sufficient to allude to the facts, that the direction\r\nof rotation and of revolution is the same for all the planets and\r\nsatellites of our system; and that the planes on which these motions are\r\nperformed, are nearly coincident. That this concordance is due to one\r\ncommon cause, no one acquainted with the theory of probabilities will\r\npretend to deny.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT OBJECT OF LA PLACE.\r\n\r\nThe science of Astronomy occupies a pre-eminent rank in the physical\r\ncircle, not only on account of that dignity conferred upon it in the\r\nmost remote antiquity, or as being the grand starting point--the\r\nearliest born of science--from whence we must contemplate the visible\r\ncreation, if we would reduce its numerous details into one harmonious\r\nwhole; but also on account of its practical fruits, of the value of\r\nwhich modern commerce is an instance. Accordingly we will glance at its\r\npast history. In the earliest ages there was no doubt a rational view\r\nentertained of the movements of the planets in space. From the Chaldeans\r\nto the Arabs, a belief prevailed, that space was filled with a pure\r\nethereal fluid, whose existence probably did not rest on any more solid\r\nfoundation than analogy or tradition. One hundred years after Copernicus\r\nhad given to the world the true arrangements of our planetary system,\r\nDescartes advanced his theory of vortices in the ethereal medium, in\r\nwhich the planets were borne in orbits around the sun, and the\r\nsatellites around their primaries. This idea retained its ground with\r\nvarious additions, until the Geometry of Newton reconciled the laws of\r\nKepler with the existence of a power pertaining to matter, varying\r\ninversely as the squares of the distances, to which power he showed the\r\nweight of terrestrial bodies was owing, and also the revolution of\r\nthe moon about the earth. Since Newton's day, those deviations from the\r\nstrict wording of Kepler's laws, have been referred to the same law,\r\nand the avowed object of the author of the \"Mechanique Celeste,\" was to\r\nbring all the great phenomena of nature within the grasp of analysis, by\r\nreferring them to one single principle, and one simple law. And in his\r\nIntroduction to the Theory of the Moon, he remarks: \"Hence it\r\nincontestibly follows, that the law of gravitation is the sole cause of\r\nthe lunar inequalities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBESSEL'S OPINION.\r\n\r\nHowever beautiful the conception, it must be admitted that in its _a\r\npriori_ aspect, it was not in accordance with human experience and\r\nanalogy to anticipate a successful issue. In nature law re-acts upon\r\nlaw, and change induces change, through an almost endless chain of\r\nconsequences; and it might be asked, why a simple law of matter should\r\nthus be exempt from the common lot? Why, in a word, there should be no\r\nintrinsic difference in matter, by which the gravitation of similar or\r\ndissimilar substances should be affected? But experiment has detected no\r\nsuch differences; a globe of lead and a globe of wood, of equal weight,\r\nattract contiguous bodies with equal force. It is evident, therefore,\r\nthat if there be such differences, human means are not yet refined\r\nenough to detect them. Was the issue successful then? Generally\r\nspeaking, we may say yes. But where there is a discrepancy between\r\ntheory and observation, however small that may be, it shows there is\r\nstill something wanting; and a high authority (Professor Bessel) says in\r\nrelation to this: \"But I think that the certainty that the theory based\r\nupon this law, _perfectly_ explains all the observations, is not\r\ncorrectly inferred.\" We will not here enumerate the cases to which\r\nsuspicion might be directed, neither will we more than just allude to\r\nthe fact, that the Theory of Newton requires a vacuum, in order that the\r\nplanetary motions may be mathematically exact, and permanent in their\r\nstability.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VACUUM REQUIRED BY MODERN SYSTEMS.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the practical belief of the learned, their fundamental\r\nprinciples forbid the avowal of a plenum, although the undulatory theory\r\nof light renders a plenum necessary, and is so far virtually recognized\r\nby them, and a correction for resistance is applied to the Comet of\r\nEncke. Yet there has been no attempt made to reconcile these opposing\r\nprinciples, other than by supposing that the celestial regions are\r\nfilled with an extremely rare and elastic fluid. That no definite view\r\nhas been agreed on, is not denied, and Sir John Herschel speculates on\r\nthe reality of a resisting medium, by suggesting questions that will\r\nultimately have to be considered, as: \"What is the law of density of the\r\nresisting medium which _surrounds_ the sun? Is it in rest or in motion?\r\nIf the latter, in what direction does it move?\" In these queries he\r\nstill clings to the idea of Encke, that the resistance is confined to\r\nthe neighborhood of the sun and planets, like a ponderable fluid. But\r\nthe most profound analyst the world has ever boasted, speaks less\r\ncautiously, (Poisson Rech.) \"It is difficult to attribute, as is usually\r\ndone, the incandescence of aerolites to friction against the molecules\r\nof the atmosphere, at an elevation above the earth where the density of\r\nthe air is almost null. May we not suppose that the electric fluid, in a\r\nneutral condition, forms a kind of atmosphere, extending far beyond the\r\nmass of our atmosphere, yet _subject to terrestrial attraction_, yet\r\n_physically imponderable_, and, consequently, following our globe in its\r\nmotion?\" The incandescence of aerolites must, therefore, be owing to\r\nfriction against the molecules of the electric fluid which forms an\r\natmosphere around the globe. According to this view, some force keeps it\r\nthere, yet it is not ponderable. As it is of limited extent, this is not\r\nthe medium whose undulations brings to light the existence of the stars;\r\nneither is Encke's, nor Herschel's, nor any other resisting medium.\r\nWhere shall we find the present established principles of science? If we\r\ngrant the Newtonians a plenum, they still cling to attraction of _all\r\nmatter_ in some shape. If we confine them to a vacuum, they will\r\nvirtually deny it. Is not this solemn trifling? How much more noble\r\nwould it be to exhibit a little more tolerance, seeing that they\r\nthemselves know not what to believe? We do not offer these remarks as\r\nargument, but merely as indications of that course of reasoning by which\r\nwe conclude that the upholders of the present systems of science are not\r\nentitled to any other ground than the pure Newtonian basis of an\r\ninterplanetary vacuum.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTIES OF THIS VIEW.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the state of the case: Matter attracts matter directly as\r\nthe mass, and inversely as the squares of the distances. This law is\r\nderived from the planetary motions; space is, consequently, a void; and,\r\ntherefore, the power which gives mechanical momentum to matter, is\r\ntransferred from one end of creation to the other, without any physical\r\nmedium to convey the impulse. At the present day the doctrines of\r\nDescartes are considered absurd; yet here is an absurdity of a far\r\ndeeper dye, without we resort to the miraculous, which at once\r\nobliterates the connection between cause and effect, which it is the\r\npeculiar province of physical science to develop. Let us take another\r\nview. The present doctrine of light teaches that light is an undulation\r\nof an elastic medium necessarily filling all space; and this branch of\r\nscience probably rests on higher and surer grounds than any other. Every\r\ntest applied to it by the refinements of modern skill, strengthens its\r\nclaims. Here then the Newtonian vacuum is no longer a void. If we get\r\nover this difficulty, by attributing to this medium a degree of tenuity\r\nalmost spiritual, we shall run upon Scylla while endeavoring to shun\r\nCharybdis. Light and heat come bound together from the sun, by the same\r\npath, and with the same velocity. Heat is therefore due also to an\r\nexcitement of this attenuated medium. Yet this heat puts our atmosphere\r\nin motion, impels onward the waves of the sea, wafts our ships to\r\ndistant climes, grinds our corn, and in various ways does the work of\r\nman. If we expose a mass of metal to the sun's rays for a single hour\r\nthe temperature will be raised. To do the same by an artificial fire,\r\nwould consume fuel, and this fuel would generate the strength or force\r\nof a horse. Estimate, therefore, the amount of force received from the\r\nsun in a single day for the whole globe, and we shall find that nothing\r\nbut a material medium will suffice to convey this force.\r\n\r\nLet us appeal to analogy. The undulations of our atmosphere produce\r\nsound; that is, convey to the ear a part of a mechanical force imparted\r\nto a solid body--a bell for instance. Let us suppose this force to equal\r\none pound. On account of the elasticity of the bell, the whole of the\r\nforce is not instantaneously imparted to the surrounding air; but the\r\ndenser the air the sooner it loses its motion. In a dense fluid like\r\nwater, the motion is imparted quickly, and the sound is not a ring but a\r\nclick. If we diminish the density of the air, the loss of motion is\r\nretarded; so that we might conceive it possible, provided the bell could\r\nbe suspended in a _perfect vacuum_, without a mechanical tie, and there\r\nwas no friction to overcome from the rigidity of its particles, that the\r\nbell would vibrate forever, although its sound could never reach the\r\near. We see, therefore, that the mechanical effect in a given time, is\r\nowing to the density of the medium. But can we resort to such an\r\nanalogy? Every discovery in the science confirms more and more the\r\nanalogy between the motions of air and the medium of space; the angle of\r\nreflexion and incidence follows the same law in both; the law of\r\nradiation and interference; and if experiments were instituted, there\r\ncan be but little doubt that sound has also got its spectrum.\r\n\r\n\r\nETHER IMPONDERABLE.\r\n\r\nThe medium of space, therefore, is capable of conveying a mechanical\r\nforce from one body to another; it therefore possesses inertia. Does it\r\nalso possess gravity? If we forsake not the principles of science, it is\r\nbut right that we expect science shall abide by her own principles.\r\nCondensation in every elastic medium is as the compressing power,\r\naccording to all experiments. In the case of our atmosphere under the\r\nlaw of gravitation, the density of air, (supposing it to be infinitely\r\nexpansible,) at a height only of ten semidiameters of the earth above\r\nits surface, would have only a density equal to the density of one cubic\r\ninch of such air we breathe, if that cubic inch was to be expanded so as\r\nto fill a globular space whose centre should be the earth, and whose\r\nsurface should take inside the whole visible creation. Such a medium\r\ncould convey no mechanical force from the sun, and therefore the medium\r\nof space cannot be ponderable. Simple as the argument is, it is\r\nunassailable.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC FLUID THE MEDIUM OF SPACE.\r\n\r\nLet us take yet another view. All experiments prove that the phenomenon\r\nwe call electricity, is owing to a disturbance of the equilibrium or\r\nnatural condition of a highly elastic fluid. In certain conditions of\r\nthe atmosphere, this fluid is accumulated in the region of the clouds,\r\nand by its tension is enabled to force a passage through opposing\r\nobstacles, in order to restore the equilibrium. By experiment it is\r\nfound that dry dense air opposes the greatest obstacle to its escape. As\r\nthe air is rarefied, this obstacle diminishes; until in a vacuum the\r\ntransmission may be considered instantaneous. There ought to be,\r\ntherefore, a greater escape of electricity from the clouds upwards than\r\ndownwards; and, if space be void, or only filled with an extremely\r\nattenuated matter, the electricity of the earth, considered as an\r\nelastic fluid without ponderosity, (and no law of condensation from the\r\nlaw of gravity in harmony with its other attributes, will allow us to\r\nconsider it otherwise,) _would long since have left the earth_. The same\r\nobjection applies in the case of the galvanic and magnetic fluids. If we\r\nentertain the idea that electricity is a mere disturbance of natural\r\ncondition, wherein two fluids are united, and that an excess of one is\r\nnecessarily attended by deficiency in the other, we depart from the\r\nfirst rule of philosophy, which teaches us to admit no greater number of\r\ncauses than are sufficient to explain the phenomenon. For we fearlessly\r\nassert that not a single fact exists in electrical science, which can be\r\nexplained better on Dufoy's theory than on Franklin's; and the former\r\nobjections would still apply.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWTONIAN GRAVITY.\r\n\r\nBut what is gravity? According to Newton: \"Haec est qualitas omnium in\r\nquibus experimenta instituere licet, et propterea per Reg. 3 de\r\nuniverses affirmanda est.\" _Vide_ Prin. Lib. Ter. Cor. 2. Prop. vi.\r\n\r\nNow the other primary qualities of matter are unaffected by\r\ncircumstances. The inertia of a particle of matter is the same at\r\nJupiter as on the earth, so also is its extension; but not so with\r\ngravity. It depends on other matter, and on its distance from it; and\r\nmay be less or greater at different times, and in different places. It\r\nis, therefore, not philosophical to say that all matter is necessarily\r\nponderous, inasmuch as it is a virtue not residing in itself alone, but\r\nneeds the existence of other matter to call it into action. If an atom\r\nwere isolated in space it would have no weight. If influenced by other\r\nmatter, there must be some physical medium to convey the influence, or\r\ngravity is not in accordance with the laws of force and motion. Which\r\nhorn of the dilemma shall we take? Let us first admit that there is a\r\nprinciple of gravitation, affecting all planetary or atomic matter, and\r\nthat there exists a highly elastic medium, pervading all space,\r\nconveying to us the light of the most distant stars, and that this\r\nmedium is not affected by gravity. In this summary way, therefore, we\r\nhave arrived at the pivot on which this theory turns.\r\n\r\nThe prominent feature of the theory, therefore, is the necessity it will\r\nshow for the existence of an all-pervading medium, and that it possesses\r\ninertia without ponderosity. That electricity is nothing more than the\r\neffects of the condensation and rarefaction of this medium by force.\r\nThat it also pervades all atomic matter, whose motions necessarily move\r\nthe medium; and, consequently, that there can be no motion without some\r\ndegree of electricity. That no change can take place in bodies either by\r\nchemical decomposition, by increase or decrease of temperature, by\r\nfriction or contact, without in some measure exciting electricity or\r\nmotion of the ether. That galvanism and magnetism are but ethereal\r\ncurrents without condensation, induced by peculiar superficial and\r\ninternal molecular arrangement of the particles of certain substances.\r\nThat light and heat are effects of the vibrations of atoms, propagated\r\nthrough this universal medium from body to body. That the atomic motion\r\nof heat can be produced by the motion of translation or momentum of\r\nbodies in the gross, that is, by friction, by compression, &c.; and can\r\nbe reconverted into momentum at our pleasure. Hence the latent heat or\r\nspecific atomic motion of combustibles, originally derived from the sun,\r\nis transferred to atoms, which are capable of being inclosed in\r\ncylinders, so as to make use of their force of expansion, which is thus\r\nconverted into momentum available for all the wants of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAVITY MECHANICAL.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to a full examination of this theory, we shall further\r\nreason that this _ether_ so far from being of that quasi spiritual\r\nnature which astronomers would have us believe, is a fearfully energetic\r\nfluid, possessing considerable inertia and elasticity; that its law of\r\ncondensation is that of all other fluids, that is, as the compressing\r\nforce directly; and that its effects are simply a product of matter and\r\nmotion. We will next endeavor to prove that the gravity of planetary\r\nmatter could not exist without this ethereal medium, by showing that it\r\nis an effect produced by the interference of _opposing waves_, whereby a\r\nbody is prevented from radiating into space its own atomic motion, from\r\nthe side opposite which another body is placed, as much as on the\r\nopposite side, and consequently it is propelled by its own motion\r\ntowards the other body. And this effect following the simple law of\r\ninertia and radiation, is directly as the mass, and inversely as the\r\nsquares of the distances.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT PRINCIPLE OF DYNAMICS.\r\n\r\nOne great principle to be kept in view in this investigation, is that\r\nwhich teaches that the product of matter, angular velocity, and distance\r\nfrom the centre of motion, must ever be a constant quality in every\r\nbalanced system. Yet this principle does not seem to be observed in the\r\ncase of the planets. We will, however, endeavor to show that it is\r\nrigidly observed. And we will extend the principle further, and contend\r\nthat all the phenomena of nature are consequences of the constant\r\ntendency of matter to conform to this principle of equilibrium, when\r\nsuffering temporary derangement from the operation of other laws. That\r\nthroughout the system of nature, equal spaces possess equal force. That\r\nwhat we call temperature, is nothing more than the motion of equilibrium\r\nor atomic momentum of space; or, in other words, that if all space were\r\nfluid, and in a state of equilibrium, the product of each atom of equal\r\nvolume, by its motion would be a constant quality. From this it would\r\nseem to follow, that the specific heat of bodies should be inversely as\r\ntheir atomic weights; and this does, no doubt, _approximately_ obtain as\r\nwas proved by Dulong and Petit, for metallic substances, more recently\r\nby Regnault, and has since been extended by Garnier to other substances.\r\nBut it is to the gaseous state that we must look for confirmation of the\r\nprinciple that equal spaces possess equal power; and in doing so, it\r\nwill be necessary to bear in mind, that the ether also is affected by\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC HEAT.\r\n\r\nIt has been contended by some that the medium which conveys the\r\nimpression of light through transparent, bodies, is necessarily more\r\ndense within the body than without; but according to this theory the\r\nconverse is true. A ray of light is a mechanical impulse, propagated\r\nthrough an elastic medium, and, like a wave in water, tends to the side\r\nof least resistance. Within a refracting body the ether is rarefied, not\r\nonly by the proximity of the atoms of the body (or its density), but\r\nalso by the motions of those atoms; so that if two _simple_ gases of\r\ndifferent specific gravity be made equal in density by compression,\r\ntheir refraction will be approximately as their specific heats. In the\r\ncase of solids and liquids, or even compound gases, there is a continual\r\nabsorption of motion to produce the cohesion of composition and\r\naggregation. And the specific heats of compound gases will be found\r\ngreater than those of simple gases, in proportion to the loss of volume\r\nby combination, _ceteris paribus_. If impenetrability be a law of\r\nmatter, the more a portion of atomic matter is condensed, the less ether\r\nwill be found in the same space. The same is also true when the natural\r\ndensity or specific gravity of a gas is greater than that of another.\r\nAnd the lighter the gas, the more will this circumstance vitiate the\r\nexperiments to determine its specific heat. There is, therefore, this\r\ngreat source of fallacy in such experiments, viz.: that the ether\r\npermeates all fluids and solids, and that _its specific heat probably\r\nfar exceeds that of all other matter_. This is a fundamental position of\r\nthe theory, in support of which we will introduce a fact announced by\r\nM. V. Regnault, which was published in the Comptes Rendus of the French\r\nAcademy for April, 1853. He says: \"In the course of my researches I have\r\nencountered, indeed, at every step, anomalies which appeared to me\r\ninexplicable, in accordance with the theories formally recognized. For\r\nthe sake of illustration I will quote one instance: 1st, a mass of gas,\r\nunder a pressure of ten atmospheres, is contained in a space which is\r\nsuddenly doubled; the pressure falls to five atmospheres. 2d. Two\r\nreservoirs of equal capacity are placed in a calorimeter; the one is\r\nfilled with a gas, under a pressure of ten atmospheres; the second is\r\nperfectly empty. In these two experiments, the initial and final\r\nconditions of the gas are the same; but this identity of condition is\r\naccompanied by calorific results which are very different; for while in\r\nthe former experiment there is a reduction of temperature, in the second\r\nthe calorimeter does not indicate the slightest alteration of\r\ntemperature.\" This experiment tends to confirm the theory. In the first\r\nexperiment, the sudden doubling of the space causes the ether also to\r\nexpand, inasmuch as the sides of the vessel prevent the instantaneous\r\npassage of the external ether. In the second, both vessels are full, one\r\nof ether, and the other of air mixed with ether; so that there is no\r\nactual expansion of the space, and consequently no derangement of the\r\nquantity of motion in that space.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW OF SPECIFIC HEAT.\r\n\r\nFrom this view it is evident that the specific heat of elastic fluids\r\ncan only be considered as approximately determined. If equal spaces\r\npossess equal momenta, and the ethereal or _tomic_ matter be inversely\r\nas the weight of the atomic matter in the same space, it follows that\r\nthe product of the specific gravities and specific heats of the simple\r\ngases should be constant; or that the specific heats should be inversely\r\nas the specific gravities,--taking pound for pound in determining those\r\nspecific heats. If we test the matter by the data now afforded, it is\r\nbest to obey the injunction, \"_In medio tutissimus ibis_.\" In the\r\nfollowing table, the first column are the values obtained by Regnault;\r\nin the second, the former values; and in the third, the mean of the two.\r\n\r\n  Gases.

We must\r\ntherefore form this product from its specific gravity and two-thirds of\r\nits specific heat. On no one subject in chemistry has there been so much\r\nlabor expended, as in determining the specific heat of watery vapor. In\r\nrelation to this, Regnault observes: \"It is important to remark that an\r\nimmense number of experiments have been made, to find the specific heat\r\nof steam, and that it is about one-half of what it was thought to be.\"\r\nHe gives its value .475; but this is vitiated still, by the\r\nnon-recognition of the specific heat of the ether. Former experiments\r\ngive .847. Perhaps Regnault's numbers are entitled to the most weight.\r\nInstead of taking the mean, therefore, we will give double weight to his\r\nresults; so that we get .600 for the specific heat of vapor, and as its\r\nspecific gravity is .625, the product .400 x .625 is .250, the same as\r\nfor hydrogen. Little importance, however, should be attached to such\r\ncoincidences, owing to the uncertainty of the numbers. If our position\r\nbe correct, the specific heat of hydrogen should be 10 times greater\r\nthan of oxygen. The atomic weights are as 1 to 8, while their volumes\r\nare as 2 to 1; therefore, for equal spaces, the matter is as 1 to 16.\r\nCalling the specific heat 10 to 1, and taking the amount due to half the\r\nspace, the product becomes as 8 to 16; but in the rarer gas there is\r\n_8 times_ as much ethereal momentum or matter, which, added to the\r\natomic matter, renders the spaces equal.[3] Regnault's results give a\r\nratio of specific heats = 1 to 3.405/.215 = 1 to 15.6.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN MEAN.\r\n\r\nThe history of science proves how few have practically respected the\r\nadage of the ancients, which we have chosen for our motto; words which\r\nought to be written in letters of gold in every language under the sun.\r\nDescartes, by considering the mechanical impulse of the ether sufficient\r\nto explain the planetary motions, failed to detect the force of gravity\r\nin the heavens. Newton, on the other hand, feeling that his law was\r\nsufficient to explain them, and requiring a vacuum for its mathematical\r\naccuracy, rejected the notion of an ethereal medium. His successors,\r\nfollowing too closely in his footsteps, and forgetting the golden law,\r\nhave forced themselves into a position by no means enviable. The\r\nshort-period comet has driven them to a resisting medium, which, while\r\naccording to Encke's hypothesis of increasing density around the sun, it\r\nexplains the anomalies of one periodical comet, requires a different\r\nlaw of density for another, and a negative resistance for a third.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLINES OF THE PROBLEM.\r\n\r\nFrom the position we now occupy, we can see the outlines of the problem\r\nbefore us, viz.: To reconcile the existence of an ethereal medium with\r\nthe law of gravitation, and to show the harmony between them. We shall\r\nthus occupy the middle ground, and endeavor to be just to the genius of\r\nDescartes, without detracting from the glory of Newton, by demonstrating\r\nthe reality of the Cartesian vortices, and by showing that the ether is\r\nnot affected by gravitation, but on the other hand is _least dense_ in\r\nthe centre of our system. But what (it may be asked) has this to do with\r\nthe theory of storms? Much every way. And we may so far anticipate our\r\nsubject as to _assert_ that every phenomenon in meteorology where force\r\nis concerned, is dependent on the motions of the great sea of electric\r\nfluid which surrounds us, in connection with its great specific,\r\ncaloric. If we are chargeable with overweening pretensions, let it be\r\nattributed to the fact that for the last fifteen years we have treated\r\nthe weather as an astronomical phenomenon, calculated by simple formulae,\r\nand that the evidence of its truth has been almost daily presented to\r\nus, so as to render it by this time one of the most familiar and\r\npalpable of all the great fundamental laws of nature. True, we have\r\nneither had means nor leisure to render the theory as perfect as we\r\nmight have done, the reason of which we have already communicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTIONS OF THE STARS.\r\n\r\nIn investigating the question now before us, we shall first take the\r\ncase of an ethereal vortex without any reference to the ponderable\r\nbodies which it contains, considering the ether to possess only inertia.\r\nIf there be a vortex around the sun, it is of finite extent; for if the\r\nether be co-extensive with space, and the stars likewise suns with\r\nsurrounding vortices, the solar vortex cannot be infinite. That there is\r\nan activity in the heavens which the mere law of attraction is\r\nincompetent to account for, is an admitted fact. The proper motions of\r\nthe fixed stars have occupied the attention of the greatest names in\r\nastronomy, and motions have been detected, which according to the theory\r\nof gravity, requires the admission of invisible masses of matter in\r\ntheir neighborhood, compared with which the stars themselves are\r\ninsignificant. But this is not the only difficulty. No law of\r\narrangement in the stars can exist that will save the Stellar system\r\nfrom ultimate destruction. The case assumed by Sir John Herschel, of a\r\ncluster, wherein the periods shall be equal, cannot be made to fulfil\r\nthe conditions of being very numerous, without infringing the other\r\ncondition--the non-intersection of their orbits; while the outside stars\r\nwould have to obey another law of gravitation, and consequently would be\r\nstill more liable to derangement from their ever-changing distances\r\nfrom each other, and from those next outside; in brief, the stability of\r\nthose stars composing the cluster would necessarily depend on the\r\nexistence of outside stars, and plenty of them. But those outside stars\r\nwould follow the common law of gravity, and must ultimately bring ruin\r\non the whole. We know such clusters do exist in the heavens, and that\r\nthe law of gravity alone must bring destruction upon them. This is a\r\ncase wherein modern science has been instrumental in drawing a veil over\r\nthe fair proportions of nature. That such collections of stars are not\r\ndesigned thus to derange the order of nature, proves _a priori_, that\r\nsome other conservative principle must exist; that the medium of space\r\nmust contain many vortices--eddies, as it were, in the great ethereal\r\nocean, whose currents are sweeping along the whole body of stars. We\r\nshall consider, (as a faint shadowing of the glorious empire of\r\nOmnipotence,) that the whole infinite extent of space is full of motion\r\nand power to its farthest verge; and it may be an allowable stretch of\r\nthe imagination to conceive that the whole comprises one infinite\r\ncylindrical vortex, whose axis is the only thing in the universe in a\r\nstate of absolute unchangeableness.\r\n\r\n\r\nVORTICOSE MOTION.\r\n\r\nLet us for a moment admit the idea of an infinite ocean of fluid matter,\r\nhaving inertia without gravity, and rotating around an infinite axis, in\r\nthis case there is nothing to counteract the effect of the centrifugal\r\nforce. The elasticity of the medium would only oppose resistance in a\r\nvortex of finite diameter. Where it is infinite, each cylindrical layer\r\nis urged outward by its own motion, and impelled also by those behind.\r\nThe result would be that all the fluid would at last have left the axis,\r\naround which would exist an absolute and eternal void; into which\r\nneither sound, nor light, nor aught material, could enter. The case of\r\na finite vortex is very different. However great the velocity of\r\nrotation, and the tendency of the central parts to recede from the axis,\r\nthere would be an inward current down either pole, and meeting at the\r\nequatorial plane to be thence deflected in radii. But this radiation\r\nwould be general from every part of the axis, and would be kept up as\r\nlong as the rotation continued, if the polar currents can supply the\r\ndrain of the radial stream, that is, if the axis of the vortex is not\r\ntoo long for the velocity of rotation and the elasticity of the ether,\r\nthere will be no derangement of the density, only a tendency. And in\r\nthis case the periodic times of the parts of the vortex will be directly\r\nas the distances from the axis, and the absolute velocities will be\r\nequal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF VORTICES.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to suspect that Newton looked at this question with a\r\njaundiced eye. To do it justice, we must consider the planetary matter\r\nin a vortex, as the exponent of its motion, and not as originating or\r\ndirecting it. If planetary matter becomes involved in any vortex, it\r\nintroduces the law of gravitation, which counteracts the expulsive force\r\nof the radial stream, and is thus enabled to retain its position in the\r\ncentre. A predominating mass in the centre will, by its influence,\r\nretain other masses of matter at a distance from the centre, even when\r\nexposed to the full power of the radial stream. If the power of the\r\ncentral mass is harmoniously adjusted to the rotation of the vortex,\r\n(and the co-existence of the phenomena is itself the proof that such an\r\nadjustment does obtain,) the two principles will not clash or interfere\r\nwith each other. Or in other words, that whatever might have been the\r\ninitial condition of the solar vortex, the ultimate condition was\r\nnecessarily one of equilibrium, or the system of the planets would not\r\nnow exist. With this view of its constitution, we must consider that the\r\nperiodic times of the planets approximately correspond to the times of\r\nthe contiguous parts of the vortex. Consequently, in the solar vortex,\r\nthe density of the ether is directly as the square roots of the\r\ndistances from the axis. This is not the place fully to enter into a\r\ndiscussion of the question, or to show that the position of each planet\r\nin the system is due to the outstanding, uncompensated, portion of the\r\nexpulsive force of the radial stream, modified by the density of the\r\nether within the planets, and also by their own densities, diameters,\r\ninclinations of axis, and periods of rotation. That Jupiter could not\r\nremain in the orbit of Mercury, nor Mercury in that of Jupiter, by\r\nmerely exchanging periods and distances, but that each planet can only\r\nbe in equilibrio in its own orbit. That any change in the eccentricities\r\nof the planetary orbits will neither increase nor diminish the action of\r\nthe radial stream of the vortex, and consequently will not interfere\r\nwith the law of gravitation. In relation to the numerous questions that\r\nwill spring up from such a position, it is sufficient here to say, that\r\nit is believed all objections can be satisfactorily answered; while, by\r\nthis light, a long range of phenomena that have hitherto baffled the\r\nsagacity of the wise, come out plainly, and discover their parentage.\r\n\r\nIn cometary astronomy we shall find much to substantiate these views.\r\nThe anomalies in their motions, the discrepancies in their periods,\r\ncalculated from different sets of observations, their nebulosities and\r\nappendages, will all receive a satisfactory solution; and these lawless\r\nwanderers of the deep be placed in a more interesting light.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEST OF A THEORY.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that the best evidence of the truth of a theory, is\r\nits ability to refer to some general principle, the greatest number of\r\nrelevant phenomena, that, like the component masses of the chiselled\r\narch, they may mutually bind and strengthen each other. This we claim\r\nto be the characteristic of this theory. At the outset it was not\r\nintended to allude to more than was actually necessary to give an\r\noutline of the theory, and to introduce the main question, yet\r\nuntouched. We have exhibited the stones of which the arch is composed;\r\nbut they may be pasteboard,--for the reader has not handled them. We\r\nwill now produce the keystone, and put it in its place. This he shall\r\nhandle and weigh. He will find it hard,--a block of granite, cut from\r\nthe quarry of observed facts, and far too heavy to be held in its place\r\nby a mere pasteboard structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nENUNCIATION OF THE THEORY.\r\n\r\nQuitting, therefore, the region of the planets, we will come down to the\r\nsurface of our own globe, to seek for some more palpable evidence of the\r\ntruth of the following propositions:\r\n\r\n1st. That space is filled with an elastic fluid, possessing inertia\r\nwithout weight.\r\n\r\n2d. That the parts of this fluid in the solar system circulate, after\r\nthe manner of a vortex, with a direct motion.\r\n\r\n3d. That there are also secondary vortices, in which the planets are\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\n4th. That the earth is also placed in a vortex of the ethereal medium.\r\n\r\n5th. That the satellites are passively carried around their primaries,\r\nwith the ethereal current, and have no rotation relative to the ether,\r\nand therefore they always present the same face to their primaries, and\r\nhave no vortex.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of these propositions involves many others, many\r\ndifficulties, many apparent anomalies and contradictions, which should\r\nbespeak for such a theory,--the offspring of observation, without the\r\naid afforded by the knowledge of others, and of toil without leisure,--a\r\nlarge share of indulgence. With this we will close these preliminary\r\nremarks, and present our theory of the physical cause which disturbs\r\nthe equilibrium of our atmosphere, and which appears the principal agent\r\nin the production of storms, in the following words:\r\n\r\nThe dynamical axis of the terral vortex passes through the centre of\r\ngravity of the earth and moon, and is continually circulating over the\r\nearth's surface in both hemispheres, in a spiral,--its latitude and\r\nlongitude, at any particular time, being dependent,--\r\n\r\n1st. On the relative mass of the moon.\r\n\r\n2d. On the inclination of the axis of the vortex to the earth's axis.\r\n\r\n3d. On the longitude of the ascending node of the vortex on the lunar\r\norbit.\r\n\r\n4th. On the longitude of the ascending node of the lunar orbit on the\r\necliptic.\r\n\r\n5th. On the eccentricity of the lunar orbit at the time.\r\n\r\n6th. On the longitude of the perigee of the lunar orbit at the time.\r\n\r\n7th. On the moon's true anomaly at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASS OF THE MOON.\r\n\r\nThose elements which represent the moon's distance and motion are\r\naccurately known, and may be taken from the Nautical Almanac, being all\r\nembodied in the moon's parallax or semi-diameter, and in the declination\r\nand right ascension; but for the most important element,--the moon's\r\nmass, we in vain look to astronomy. In fact, it may be averred that the\r\nimportance attached to astronomical authority, concerning the mass of\r\nthe moon, has caused more trouble than any other question of the whole\r\ntheory, until we trusted implicitly to the theory itself to determine\r\nit. The determination of three unknown elements, viz.: the moon's mass,\r\nthe inclination of the axis of the vortex, and the right ascension of\r\nthat axis, is a more difficult problem than at first sight appears,\r\nowing to the nature of the phenomena, which affords the only clue for\r\nits solution. There are six principal vortices ever in operation on the\r\nsurface of the earth, and their disturbing influence extends from 200 to\r\n400 miles. To find the precise centre, by one observer confined to one\r\nplace, is difficult; and to separate them, so as to be fully assured\r\nthat you have the right one, is perhaps still more so. Happily this\r\ntedious labor is accomplished, and we are able with confidence to give\r\nthe following important elements, as very close approximations to the\r\ntruth:\r\n\r\n  Mass of the moon                      1/72.3\r\n  Obliquity of the axis of the vortex   15d to  32d variable.\r\n  Right ascension of ditto              250d to 290d variable.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that we are now discussing the main or central\r\nvortex of the earth; but before applying them to the calculation, we\r\nwill explain the _modus operandi_, waiving for the present the\r\nconsideration of the law of density in the Terral vortex. It is evident\r\nat first sight that if the periodic times of the parts of the vortex\r\ncontiguous to the moon, are equal to the moon's period approximately,\r\nthat the velocity of the ether is greater at the surface of the earth\r\nthan the velocity of that surface. Now, we have before argued that the\r\nether possesses inertia, it therefore would under such circumstances\r\nexert some mechanical action. Consequently, the aerial envelope of our\r\nglobe, or its superior stratum, is impelled eastward by _convection_[4]\r\nof the more rapidly rotating ether. And from the extreme tenuity of its\r\nupper layers, is probably forced into immense waves, which will observe\r\nto a certain degree, a general parallelism north and south.\r\n\r\n\r\nATMOSPHERIC CURRENTS.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact, that the prevailing current of the atmosphere\r\nin high latitudes is from the westward. The cause of this is ascribed by\r\nProfessor Dove to the transfer of the equatorial portions to a higher\r\nlatitude, by which the excess of its rotative velocity is made apparent,\r\nby outstripping the slower moving surface in its progress eastward. No\r\ndoubt some effect is due to this, but still a difficulty remains. Let us\r\nfollow this current. The polar current reaches the surface on the\r\nborders of the trades with less rotative velocity than the surface, and\r\nis, therefore, met by the surface as a current partaking of both\r\nmotions. In the northern hemisphere it is north-east deflected to east\r\nas it approaches the southern trades. By the same reasoning, coming from\r\nthe north before it readies the surface, it ought to be also a\r\nnorth-east wind above the lower westerly currents. Now it is an observed\r\nfact, that while in the latitude of New York, for instance, the lower\r\nwesterly winds are to the easterly, as 3 or 4 to 1, in the highest\r\nregions of observed clouds, the ratio is much increased; and according\r\nto our own observations in this place,[5] we have never seen the highest\r\ncirrus clouds moving westward. How then is this continual interchange\r\nkept up? Assuredly we cannot have a current from the poles without a\r\ncontrary current to the poles. If we go into the arctic circle, we again\r\nfind the westerly and northerly winds predominating. If the current from\r\nthe equator follows the surface, the westerly winds ought to be\r\nsouth-west. If it be above the surface wind, then the surface wind is\r\nthe polar current, and ought to be north-east. Whereas, from the\r\ntestimony of all who have visited these regions, the prevailing winds\r\nare north-west. How can this be?\r\n\r\nAgain, it is proved that the upper current near the equator is also from\r\nthe westward--as near due west as possible. Take the latitude of St\r\nVincent. The difference between the cosine of 13d and radius applied\r\nto the circumference, is about 600 miles, which would give 25 miles per\r\nhour to the eastward, in lat. 13d. But to do this, it is necessary to\r\ntransfer it suddenly from the equator; for by a slow motion the easterly\r\ntendency would be lost. Give it 24 hours from the equator to lat. 13d,\r\nwithout any loss of easterly tendency, and it comes to that latitude\r\nwith a velocity of 38 miles per hour to the northward, and only 25 to\r\nthe eastward; we have, therefore, a wind from south-west by south. Yet\r\nit is known that in the tropics the highest visible clouds move from the\r\nwestward. But as no such case could occur as a transfer in twenty-four\r\nhours without loss, and if we diminish the time, the wind is still more\r\nsoutherly. Meteorologists usually cite the falling of ashes at Jamaica\r\nduring the eruption of Coseguina, in Guatamala, in February 1835, as\r\ncoming from south-west, whereas the true direction was about west\r\nsouth-west, and the trade wind below was about north. But do we deny\r\nthat there is an interchange between the frigid and torrid zones? By no\r\nmeans; but we would show that the great controlling power is external to\r\nour atmosphere, and that the relative velocities of the earth and the\r\natmosphere is not alone adequate to account for it. By this view the\r\npolar current is a north-west wind (which is impossible by Professor\r\nDove's theory), or is carried eastward by electric convection.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUTTON'S THEORY.\r\n\r\nWhether we adopt the views of Fourier or Poullet, as to the temperature\r\nof the planetary spaces, it is certain that it is at least equal to, or\r\nless than, the lowest temperature of our globe. It is also a well-known\r\nfact, that the capacity of air to hold vapor in solution, increases in a\r\nhigher ratio than the temperature, so that the intermingling of\r\nsaturated portions of air, at different temperatures, must _necessarily_\r\nbe attended by precipitation of moisture. This idea was advanced by\r\nDoctor Hutton, and considered competent to account for the prominent\r\nmeteorological phenomena, until Professor Espy broached a questionable\r\nprinciple, (and which is rendered still more so by the late\r\ninvestigations of Regnault,) in opposition to Hutton's theory. That the\r\ntheory is deficient, no one can gainsay. That Espy has rendered the\r\nquestion clearer, is equally hazardous to assert. Hutton failed in\r\nshowing a cause for such intermingling on a sufficient scale; while\r\nEspy, it may be suspected, has misinterpreted facts, and incautiously\r\nrejected the only element possessing the power of raising the storm.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT SPECIFIC HEAT OF THE ETHER.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the degree of condensation or rarefaction in the terral\r\nvortex, there must necessarily be a current down the pole or axis,\r\nthence to be deflected along the equatorial plane of the vortex, and\r\nthis drain will be as perpetual as the rarefaction of the centre,\r\n(caused by the centrifugal force of rotation,) which calls it forth. It\r\nwill now be perceived that the fluid of the vortex, which we shall still\r\nterm ether, is neither more nor less than the electric fluid,--the\r\nmighty energising principle of space,--the source of motion,--the cause\r\nof magnetism, galvanism, light, heat, gravity, of the aurora, the\r\nlightning, the zodiacal light, of the tails and nebulosities of comets,\r\nof the great currents of our atmosphere, of the samiel, the hurricane,\r\nand the earthquake. It will be perceived that we treat it as any other\r\nfluid, in relation to its law of motion and condensation. But we have no\r\nright to base our calculations on its resistance, by the analogies\r\npresented by ponderable or atomic matter. Atomic fluids,--even pure air,\r\nmay be considered viscid and tenacious when compared to an infinitely\r\ndivisible fluid, between whose particles (if we may use the term) no\r\n_attraction_ of any kind exists. No ponderable matter can come in close\r\ncontact without feeling the influence of the gravitating force which, at\r\ninsensible distances,--such as the breadth of a wave of ether, is\r\nincreased in power, and becomes a cohering and combining force. We\r\ncontend that this fluid is the only fluid of space; when condensed it is\r\npositive, and seeks to escape; when rarefied it is negative, and\r\nreceives from the contiguous space a restoration of its power. That it\r\ncan give and receive, from planetary matter, what we call motion; and\r\nconsequently can affect the temperature of such matter, and be in turn\r\naffected by it. And finally that, for its degree of inertia, it exceeds\r\nin elasticity and specific heat all other matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESS OF DERANGEMENT.\r\n\r\nThis premised, we see that as the axis of the vortex traverses the\r\nsurface of the earth, there is a tendency to derange the electric state\r\nof the parts travelled over, by bringing the atmosphere and surface of\r\nthe earth under the rarefied centre of the vortex. For it is not the\r\nether of the atmosphere alone that is affected. It is called forth from\r\nthe earth itself, and partakes of the temperature of the\r\ncrust,--carrying up into the upper regions the vapor-loaded atmosphere\r\nof the surface. The weather now feels close and warm; even in winter\r\nthere is a balmy change in the feelings. The atmosphere then fills with\r\nhaze, even to the highest regions of the clouds; the clouds themselves\r\nare ill defined; generally the wind comes in at E. S-E., or S., getting\r\nvery fresh by the time it chops round to W. In from six to twelve hours\r\nfrom the time of the meridian passage, in this latitude, the Big Cumuli\r\nhave formed, and commenced their march eastward. In summer time there is\r\nalways thunder and lightning, when the passage is attended or followed\r\nby a storm. In winter, generally, but not always. In summer, the\r\ndiameter of the storm is contracted; in winter, dilated; in consequence\r\nof this, summer is the best season to trace the vortices of the earth\r\nthrough their revolutions. Let us now attend a little to the results.\r\nThe ether of the surface atmosphere partakes of the temperature of that\r\natmosphere, so also the ether of the earth's crust partakes of the\r\ntemperature of the crust; and its escape is rapid, compared with the\r\nascent of the air. When it arrives at the colder layers of air above,\r\nits temperature sinks, and, on account of the greater specific caloric,\r\nit imparts a much higher temperature to those layers than is due to\r\ntheir position; an elevation consequently takes place,--begetting a\r\ndrain from below, until the upper regions are loaded with a warm and\r\nvapory atmosphere. If the action of the sun conspires at the same time\r\nto increase the effect, the storm will be more violent. In twelve hours\r\nafter the meridian passage of the vortex, the storm is brought under the\r\nparts of the ethereal atmosphere of the earth most remote from the axis;\r\na reaction now takes place; the cold ether of space rushes in, and, on\r\naccount of its great specific caloric, it abstracts from the warm\r\natmosphere more than pertains to the difference of temperature, and\r\nthere is a great condensation. Rain and hail may form in fearful\r\nquantities; and when the equilibrium is restored, the temperature will\r\nhave fallen many degrees.\r\n\r\nAs it is important that we should have a clear view of the character of\r\nthe ether, we will revert to the principle we have advocated, viz.: that\r\nin equal spaces there are equal momenta. What the ether wants in\r\ninertia, is made up by its motion or specific heat, considering in this\r\ncase inertia to stand for weight when compared with ponderable matter;\r\nso that to raise an equivalent amount of inertia of ether to the same\r\ntemperature as atmospheric air, will require as much more motion or\r\nspecific heat as its matter is less. And this we conceive to be a law of\r\nspace in relation to all free or gaseous matter. To apply it to solids\r\nwould require a knowledge of the amount of force constituting the\r\ncohesion of the solid.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF DIMINISHED PRESSURE.\r\n\r\nBut there is another principle which modifies these effects. We have\r\nalready adverted to the action of the tangential current of the vortex\r\nforcing the outer layers of the atmosphere into waves. These waves will\r\nbe interfered with by the different vortices, sometimes being increased\r\nand sometimes diminished by them.[6] If these waves are supposed very\r\nwide, (which would be the case in the attenuated outside layers of the\r\natmosphere,) the action of the vortex will be greater in its passage\r\nover a place, which at the time corresponded to the depression point of\r\nthe wave, that is, to the line of low barometer; because here there\r\nwould be less resistance to overcome in the passage of the ether from\r\nthe surface of the earth into space; so that we may conceive each vortex\r\nmaking a line of storms each day around the earth, separated by less\r\ndisturbed intervals. After the formation of the storm, it of course has\r\nnothing to do with the vortex that produced it; it travels in the\r\ngeneral direction of the local atmosphere of the place--in intratropical\r\nlatitudes westward, in extratropical latitudes eastward. If, therefore,\r\nthe disturbance forms at the place of observation, there will probably\r\nbe no storm; but further eastward its action would be more apparent or\r\nviolent. It is impossible, of course, to lay down any general\r\ndescription which shall meet every case. It is a knowledge that can only\r\nbe acquired by observation, and then is not readily or easily\r\ncommunicated. There are many contingencies to be allowed for, and many\r\nmodifying causes to keep sight of, to enter into which would only be\r\ntedious; we shall, therefore, confine ourselves to the prominent\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF THE POLAR CURRENT.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the passage of the axis of the vortex may derange the\r\nelectric tension of the parts passed over; but there is another mode of\r\naction not yet adverted to.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1]\r\n\r\nWhen the moon is at her perigee, the axis of the vortex passes through\r\nthe centre of gravity of the earth and moon at C, and cuts off the\r\nsegment RR. At the apogee, on account of her greater distance, and of\r\nher consequent power to _push_ the earth out from the axis of the vortex\r\nXX, the segment R'R' is only cut off by the axis; and the angle which\r\nthe axis makes with the surface will vary with the arcs AR and A'R'; for\r\nthese arcs will measure the inclination from the nature of the circle.\r\nIn passing from the perigee to the apogee the axis will pass over the\r\nlatitudes intermediate between R and R' in both hemispheres, neither\r\nreaching to the equator E, nor to the pole P. Let us now suppose a\r\nmeridian of the earth, represented by the line NRS, N being north, and S\r\nsouth, and the surface of the atmosphere by N'S'; XX still representing\r\nthe axis of the vortex, ordinarily inclined 34d or 35d to the surface.\r\nLet us also conceive the rotation of the earth to cease, (the action of\r\nthe vortex remaining the same,) thus leaving the axis over a particular\r\nlongitude. If the ether possesses inertia, there will be an actual\r\nscooping out of the upper portions, driving them southward to a certain\r\ndistance, where the atmosphere will be piled up above the ordinary\r\nlevel. There will, therefore, be a strong contrary current at the\r\nsurface of the earth to restore the equilibrium, and if the action be\r\nviolent, the surface wind will be increased; so that if it be considered\r\ntangential to the surface at S, its own momentum will tend to make it\r\nleave the surface and mount up to T; and in this way increase the action\r\ndue to the ether. Now, although the axis is never stationary, but\r\ntravels round the earth in less than twenty-five hours, yet there is a\r\ntendency to this mode of action; and it is even sometimes palpable to\r\nthe observer when the axis has passed immediately to the northward; for\r\nthe pinnate shafts and branching plumes of the cirri often reach far to\r\nthe south of the southern boundary of the storm. These shafts are always\r\nlonger when radiating from the northward than when proceeding from the\r\nsouthward. The cause is understood by the above figure. At such a time,\r\nafter dark, the auroral shafts will also be seen over the storm to the\r\nnorthward, but will be invisible to those beneath. There is this to be\r\nobserved, however, that the visibility of the ethereal current (or the\r\naurora) is more frequent when the passage of the vortex is not attended\r\nwith any great commotion, its free passage being perhaps obstructed by\r\ntoo dry an atmosphere; hence it becomes more visible. But it may be\r\nasserted that a great aurora is never seen except when a vortex is near,\r\nand to the northward, and within a few hours of its passage over the\r\nmeridian. We have, however, seen partial auroras to the south when none\r\nexisted north, and also cases when the radiation was from west, but they\r\nare never as bright as in the north. They are all due, however, to the\r\nsame cause; and we have frequently followed a vortex for three days to\r\nthe northward, (that is, seen the effects of its meridian passage,) at\r\n700 miles distance, by the aurora, and even by the lightning, which\r\nproves plainly that the _exterior layers_ of our atmosphere can reflect\r\na flash of lightning, assisted by the horizontal refraction, otherwise\r\nthe curvature of the earth would sink it ten miles below the horizon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2]\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMITS OF THE VORTEX.\r\n\r\nThe action of the polar current of the ether, therefore, tends to cause\r\na depression of the barometer, and an elevation to the _northward_ and\r\nsouthward, and there is a general set of the wind below to the point of\r\ngreatest depression. The action of the tangential current works the\r\nouter surface of the atmosphere into great ridges and hollows, whose\r\ndistances apart as well as actual dimensions, are continually changing\r\nunder the influences of causes not yet alluded to, and it is in the\r\nhollows where the action of the polar current will be principally\r\nexpended. Luckily for the earth, the axis of the vortex is never long in\r\npassing over any particular place. In this latitude, whose natural\r\ncosine is three-fourths, the velocity _westward_ is over 700 miles per\r\nhour; but at its extreme limits north, the motion is much slower, and is\r\nrepeated for two or three days in nearly the same latitude, for then it\r\nbegins to return to the south; thus oscillating in about one sidereal\r\nperiod of the moon. At its southern limit, the vortex varies but slowly\r\nin latitude for the same time, but the velocity is much greater. The\r\nextreme latitudes vary at different times with the eccentricity of the\r\nlunar orbit, with the place or longitude of the perigee, and with the\r\nlongitude of the moon's ascending node, but in no case can the _central\r\nvortex_ reach within 5d of the equator, or higher than about 75d of\r\nlatitude north or south. Hence there are no storms strictly speaking\r\nbeyond 88d[7] of latitude; although a storm may be raging close by, at\r\nthe turning point south, and draw in a very strong gale from the\r\nnorthward with a clear sky above. So also, although rains and short\r\nsqualls may be frequent in the vapor-loaded atmosphere of the equator,\r\nyet the hurricane does not reach there, owing to the adjustment of the\r\nmass and distance of the moon, and the inclination of the axes of the\r\nvortices to the axis of the earth. If the temperature of the upper limit\r\nor highest latitude of the vortex, was equal to the temperature which\r\nobtains at its lowest limit, and the daily extremes of the solar\r\ninfluence as great, the hurricanes would be as violent at the one as the\r\nother, and even more so on account of the smaller velocity. But the\r\ndeficiency of temperature and moisture, (which last is all-important,)\r\nprevents the full development of the effect. And even in the tropics,\r\nthe progress of the sun, by its power in directing the great annual\r\ncurrents of the atmosphere, only conspires in the summer and autumn\r\nmonths, to bring an atmosphere in the track of the vortices, possessing\r\nthe full degree of moisture and deficiency of electric tension, to\r\nproduce the derangement necessary to call forth the hurricane in its\r\ngreatest activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUTINE OF A STORM.\r\n\r\nThe novelty and originality of this theory will perhaps justify us in\r\ndwelling a little longer on what observation has detected. The vortex\r\n(and we are now speaking only of the central vortex) does not derange\r\nevery place alike, but _skips_ over large tracts of longitude in its\r\nprogress westward. We speak here of the immovable axis of the vortex as\r\nin motion; in reality it is the rotation of the earth which brings every\r\nmeridian under its influence in some latitude once every twenty-four\r\nhours. The centre of greatest derangement forms the nucleus, towards\r\nwhich the surface currents, under certain restrictions, flow. The\r\nstrongest current will, however, usually be from the south, on account\r\nof the inclination of the axis of the vortex to the surface of the\r\nearth.[8] These currents continuing onwards by their vires inertiae,\r\naccording to the first law of motion, assist somewhat in conveying the\r\nwarm surface wind, loaded with moisture, into the region of cloud; and\r\nthe diminution of temperature causes the condensation of large masses of\r\nvapor, according to Hutton's views; and the partial vacuum thus\r\nproduced, causes a still greater intermingling. But we have already\r\nshown that this is not the sole cause, nor is it ever more than\r\npartially accomplished. The ether of the lower atmosphere, and of the\r\ncrust of the earth, is disturbed, and rushes towards the rarefied axis\r\nfrom the surface, and with the temperature of the surface, thus\r\nconveying the surface atmosphere, in a measure, along with it. In the\r\nupper regions, this ether (or electric fluid) cools down, or parts with\r\nsome of its heat, to the air of those regions, and, by its great\r\nspecific caloric, necessarily and unduly increases the temperature of\r\nthe air. This, by its expansion and ascension will cause a further\r\ninflux from below, until the upper atmosphere becomes loaded with vapor.\r\nIn twelve hours, at least, a reaction must take place, as that part of\r\nthe earth's surface is carried six or seven thousand miles from the\r\naxis, where the ether is more dense. This in turn descends to the\r\nsurface, carrying with it the temperature of space, at least 60d below\r\nzero; a great condensation must follow; local derangements of the\r\nelectric equilibrium in the centre of large clouds, when the\r\ncondensation is active, must now take place, while partially\r\nnonconducting masses intervene, to prevent an instantaneous restoration\r\nof the equilibrium, until the derangement is sufficient to cause the\r\nnecessary tension, when all obstacles are rent asunder, and the ether\r\nissues forth, clothed in the power and sublimity of the lightning. It is\r\na fearfully-energetic fluid, and, when sufficiently disturbed, competent\r\nto produce the most violent tornado, or the most destructive earthquake.\r\nThat these two phenomena have simultaneously occurred, seems well\r\nauthenticated; but the earthquake, of course, must be referred generally\r\nto derangements of the electric equilibrium of the earth's interior, of\r\nwhich at present we know but little.\r\n\r\nThe day or morning previous to the passage of the vortex, is frequently\r\nvery fine, calm, mild, and sleepy weather,--commonly called a weather\r\nbreeder. After the storm has fully matured, there is an approach of the\r\nclouds to the surface, a reduction of the temperature above, and the\r\nhuman body feels the change far more than is due to the fall of\r\ntemperature. This is owing to the cold ether requiring so much heat to\r\nraise its temperature to that of surrounding bodies, or, in other words,\r\nis due to its great specific caloric. In summer, this falling of the\r\nupper layers in front of the storm is so apparent, that every part is\r\nseen to expand under the eye by perspective,--swelling, and curling, and\r\nwrithing, like the surface of water or oil when just commenced boiling.\r\nThe wind now partakes of the motion of the external ether, and moves\r\nwith the storm eastward (in this latitude), or from N-E. to S-E., until\r\nthe action ceases.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS NECESSARY TO PRODUCE A STORM.\r\n\r\nThe vortex, in its passage round the earth, may only meet with a few\r\nlocalities favorable for producing a very violent storm; but these\r\nnuclei will generally be connected by bands of cloudy atmosphere; so\r\nthat could we view them from the moon, the earth would be belted like\r\nthe planet Jupiter. There is reason to suspect, also, that there are\r\nvariations in the energy of the ethereal motions, independent of the\r\nconditions of the earth and its atmosphere, which affects even the\r\nradial stream of the sun. For the zodiacal light, which is caused by\r\nthis radial stream, is at times much more vivid than at others. Also in\r\nthe case of the aurora, on our own globe. On this point there is much to\r\nsay, but here is not the place. The conditions favorable for the\r\nproduction of a storm at the _central_ passage of a vortex, are a\r\nprevious exemption from excitement _ceteris paribus_, a high temperature\r\nand dew point, a depression of the barometer, and local accumulation of\r\nelectric tension, positive or negative; and these are influenced by the\r\nstorms in other places controlling the aerial currents, and thus\r\ndetermining the atmosphere of the place.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATERAL VORTICES.\r\n\r\nWe have already alluded to the lateral vortices of the terral system. We\r\nmust now resort to a diagram.\r\n\r\nIn the following figure, the arrows represent the ethereal current of\r\nthe terral vortex; the linear circle, the earth; C the centre of gravity\r\nof the earth and moon, and, consequently, the central vortex or axis of\r\nthe vortex of the earth, I represents the position of the inner vortex,\r\nand O that of the outer vortex. These two last are eddies, caused by the\r\nobstacle presented by the earth in being _pushed_ out from the centre by\r\nthe moon, and are called lateral vortices. There are, therefore, two\r\nlateral vortices, and one central, in both hemispheres, and by this\r\nsimple arrangement is the earth watered, and the atmospheric circulation\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATION OF THEIR ACTION.\r\n\r\nIf we place a globe in a vessel of water, so that the vertex shall only\r\njust be covered, and place the globe eccentrically in the vessel so that\r\nthe centre of the vessel may not be too far from the outside of the\r\nglobe, and then impart an equable but slow motion to the water, in the\r\nmanner of a vortex; by viewing the reflected light of the sky from the\r\nsurface of the water above the globe, we shall be able to trace a\r\nsuccession of dimples, originating at I and O, and passing off with the\r\ncurrent, and dying away. The direction of the fluid in these little\r\neddies, will be the same as the direction of the current in the main\r\nvortex. If we displace the globe, so as to remove it far from the centre\r\nof the vessel, and impart the same motion, the vortex I will be found at\r\nE, and the direction of the current will be contrary to the direction\r\nof the fluid in the vessel. In the case of the earth and moon, the\r\ndisplacement can never change the position of the inner vortex much. It\r\nwill always be to the right hand of the central vortex in north\r\nlatitudes, and in consequence of the ether striking our globe in such a\r\nposition, the current that is deflected from its true path, by the\r\nprotuberance of the earth forcing it inside, is prevented by the\r\ncircular current of the parts nearer the axis of the vortex, from\r\npassing off; so that a vortex is formed, and is more violent, _ceteris\r\nparibus_, than the vortex at O.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER OF OCCURRENCE.\r\n\r\nWhether this mode of action has been correctly inferred, matters little;\r\nthe lateral vortices follow the law of such a position. The inner vortex\r\nalways precedes the central from five to eight days, when ascending in\r\nthis latitude, and comes to the meridian after the moon. The outer\r\nvortex, on the contrary, follows the central in its monthly round, and\r\ncomes to the meridian before the moon. It will be readily understood\r\nthat if the axes of these lateral vortices be produced through the\r\nearth, they will pass through similar vortices in the opposite\r\nhemisphere; but as the greatest latitude of the one, corresponds to the\r\nleast latitude of the other, the same calculation will not answer for\r\nboth. The same remark applies to the central vortex also.\r\n\r\nThus there are six passages each month over latitude 41d; but as there\r\nare intervals of 3d to 6d between two consecutive passages of the same\r\nvortex, it may happen that an observer in the middle latitude, would\r\nperhaps see nothing of their effects without looking for them. Generally\r\nspeaking, they are not only seen, but felt. The time of the passage of\r\nthe outer vortex ascending, corresponds so nearly (in 38d of latitude)\r\nat certain times, with the passage of the central vortex descending,\r\nthat the two may be considered one if attention is not directed to it.\r\nThe orbits of these lateral vortices depend, like that of the central\r\nvortex, on the orbit of the moon for eccentricity, but the longitudes of\r\nthe perigee will not correspond with the longitude of the moon's\r\nperigee. This follows from the theory. As the elements of these orbits\r\nare only approximately determined, we shall confine our calculations to\r\nthe orbit of the central vortex.\r\n\r\n\r\nREDFIELD'S THEORY OF STORMS.\r\n\r\nIt will now appear plainly to the reader, that this theory of storms\r\ndiffers in every particular from the rival theories of Redfield and\r\nEspy, both as to the cause and the _modus agendi_. It would appear at\r\nfirst sight, as if the discovery of these vortices would at once remedy\r\nthe great defect in the theory of Redfield, viz.: that no adequate cause\r\nis assigned for the commencement and continuation of the vorticose\r\nmotion, in the great circular whirlwinds which compose a storm. The\r\nfacts, however, are adverse to such an application. According to\r\nMr. Redfield, the rotation of a circular storm in the northern\r\nhemisphere is from right to left, and the reverse in the southern. The\r\nauthor's attention has, of course, been considerably directed to this\r\npoint; but in every case he has been unfortunate in finding in the\r\nclouds a rotation from left to right. Some cases are mentioned in the\r\nappended record of the weather. He has also noticed many of those small\r\nwhirlwinds on arid plains, in Egypt, in Mexico, and in California,\r\nwhich, in the great majority of cases, were also from left to right. His\r\nopportunities, however, have not extended to the southern hemisphere.\r\nThis theory has not, however, been formed on theoretic views, but by\r\nlooking nature in the face for years, and following her indications.\r\nAccordingly, we find that the changes of the wind in a storm forbid the\r\nadoption of the circular hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHIRLWINDS VERY LIMITED IN DIAMETER.\r\n\r\nThe theory, as extended by Col. Reid, rests on a simple rotation around\r\na progressing centre, and is found sometimes supported by evidence of\r\nthe most violent action at the centre, and sometimes by showing that the\r\ncentral portion is often in a state of calm. We do not attempt to\r\nreconcile these views; but would merely observe, that an atmospheric\r\nvortex must be subject to the same dynamical laws as all other vortices;\r\nand inasmuch as the medium cannot differ greatly in density, from the\r\ncentre to the circumference, the periodic times of the parts of the\r\nvortex, must be directly as their distances from the axis, and\r\nconsequently the absolute velocities must be equal. If Mr. Redfield\r\nresorts to a spirally inward current, it would be a centripetal instead\r\nof a centrifugal current, and therefore could not cause the barometer to\r\nfall, which was the best feature of the theory in its primitive form.\r\nThe absolute velocity of the wind is the important element which most\r\nconcerns us. In the case of a tornado of a few yards in diameter, there\r\nis no doubt a circular motion, caused by the meeting of opposing\r\ncurrents; but this may be considered a circle of a very small diameter.\r\nThe cause is due to a rapid escape of electric or ethereal matter, from\r\nthe crust of the earth, called forth by the progressing, disturbed space\r\nabove; this involves the air, and an ascending column in rotation begets\r\nthe rush on all sides to that column in straight lines: consequently,\r\nthe velocities will be inversely as the distances from the axis, and the\r\nforce of the current as the squares of the velocities. On the circular\r\ntheory, no increase of velocity would be conferred by the approach of\r\nthe centre, and consequently no increase of power.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTION TO CIRCULAR STORMS.\r\n\r\nAnother objection to the circular theory of storms, is the uniformity of\r\nphase. If that theory be true, we see no reason why a person should not\r\nbe sometimes on the northern side of the gale. By referring to a\r\ndiagram, we perceive that on the northern side the changes of the wind\r\npursue a contrary direction to what they do on the south, yet in nine\r\ncases out of ten, each vessel meeting a hurricane will find the same\r\nchanges of wind as are due to the southern side of the storm. It is\r\ntrue, that if a vessel be to the northward of a great hurricane, there\r\nwill almost certainly be a north-east gale drawn in, and this might be\r\nset down as the outer limits of a circular storm. But when the storm\r\nreally begins, the wind comes round south-east, south, south-west,\r\nending at north-west, and frequently is succeeded, on the following day,\r\n(if in middle latitude,) by a moderate breeze from the northward. Now,\r\nif the north-east gale spoken of above, was the outer limits of an\r\natmospheric vortex, a vessel sailing west ought not to meet the\r\nhurricane, as a north-east wind is indicative of being already on the\r\nwest side, or behind the storm.\r\n\r\nAgain, the characters of the winds, and appearances at the different\r\nchanges, are opposed to the circular theory. At a distance of fifty\r\nmiles from the centre of a storm, the wind which passes over a ship as a\r\nsoutherly wind, will have made a rotation and a half, with the hurricane\r\nvelocity, before the same wind can again pass the ship as a northerly\r\nwind, (supposing the progress eastward, and the ship lying to,) that is,\r\nthe same wind which in another place was a south wind two hours before,\r\nand after only going one degree north, becomes a northerly\r\nwind,--changed in character and temperature, as every seaman is well\r\naware. In a storm, if the circular theory be true, the character and\r\ntemperature should be the same, no matter from what point the wind is\r\nblowing. This should be a conclusive argument.\r\n\r\nMr. Espy has also changed his ground on the storms of the United States;\r\nhe does not now contend that the winds blow inwards to a centre, but to\r\na line either directly or obliquely. Thus we see that while Mr. Redfield\r\nconcedes to Mr. Espy a spirally inward current, the latter also gives up\r\na direct current to the centre, to Mr. Redfield. This shows at least an\r\napproximation to the truth.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for the support of this theory, that we should\r\nderive any materials from the ruins of others; we shall therefore not\r\navail ourselves of certain discrepant results, which can be found in\r\nmany of the storms cited by Colonel Reid. With respect to Mr. Espy's\r\n_cause_ of storms, the experiments of Regnault may be considered as\r\ndecisive of the question:--1st, because the specific heat of vapor is so\r\nmuch less than Espy assumed it to be; and 2d, because the expansion of\r\nair in a free space does not suffer any change of volume by ascending,\r\nexcept what is due to diminished pressure, and the natural temperature\r\nof that elevation.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDICATIONS OF A STORM.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with our theory, the direction and force of the wind in a\r\nstorm are due to ascending columns of air, supplied from the upper\r\nportion of the atmospheric stratum beneath the clouds. The commotion\r\nbegins at the highest limits of the cirri, and even at greater\r\nelevations. Hence, the hazy appearance of the sky is a legitimate\r\nprecursor of the coming gale. As a general thing, the wind will blow (at\r\nthe surface) towards the centre of greatest commotion, but it is too\r\ndependent on the ever-varying position and power of temporary nuclei of\r\ndisturbance, to be long steady, except when the disturbance is so remote\r\nthat its different centres of induction are, as it were, merged into one\r\ncommon focus. When a vortex is descending, or passing from north to\r\nsouth, and withal very energetic at the time, the southerly wind (which\r\nmay always be considered the principal wind of the storm in this\r\nhemisphere) may blow steadily towards the vortex for three or even four\r\ndays. When a vortex is ascending, the induced northerly current will be\r\ncomparatively moderate, and be frequently checked by the southerly wind\r\noverblowing the storm, and arriving the day before the vortex which\r\nproduced it.\r\n\r\nThe important point for the navigator, is to know the time of meridian\r\npassage of the vortex, and its latitude at the time of the passage, and\r\nthen be guided by the indications of the weather and the state of\r\nbarometer. If it commences storming the day before the passage, he may\r\nexpect it much worse soon after the passage; and again, if the weather\r\nlooks bad when no vortex is near, he may have a steady gale setting\r\ntowards a storm, but no storm until the arrival of a vortex. Again, if\r\nthe barometer is low the day before the vortex passes, there may be high\r\nbarometer to the west, and the passage be attended by no great\r\ncommotion, as it requires time for the storm to mature, and consequently\r\nits greatest violence will be to the east. If at the ship the barometer\r\nis high, the vortex may still produce a storm on a line of low barometer\r\nto the west, and this line may reach the ship at the time of the\r\npassage. In tropical climates the trouble must be looked for to the\r\neastward; as a storm, once excited, will travel westward with that\r\nstratum of atmosphere in which the great mass of vapor is lodged, and in\r\nwhich, of course, the greatest derangement of electric tension is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nIt will now be seen that we do not admit, with Col. Reid, that a storm\r\ncontinues in existence for a week together. Suppose a hurricane to\r\noriginate in the Antilles at the southern limits of a vortex, the\r\nhurricane would die away, according to our theory, if the vortex did not\r\ncome round again and take up the same nucleus of disturbance. On the\r\nthird day the vortex is found still further north, and the apparent path\r\nof the hurricane becomes more curved. In latitude 30d the vortex passes\r\nover 3d or 5d of latitude in a day; and here being the latitude where\r\nthe lower atmospheric current changes its course, the storm passes due\r\nnorth, and afterwards north-east. Now, each day of the series there is a\r\ndistinct hurricane, (caused by an increase of energy in a particular\r\nvortex, as we have before hinted,) each one overlapping on the remains\r\nof the preceding; but in each the same changes of the wind are gone\r\nthrough, and the same general features preserved, as if it were truly a\r\nprogressive whirlwind, except that each vessel has the violent part of\r\nit, as if she was in the southern half of the whirl. The apparent\r\nregularity of the Atlantic storms in direction, as exhibited by Col.\r\nReid, are owing in a great degree to the course of the Gulf Stream, in\r\nwhich a vortex, in its successive passages in different latitudes, finds\r\nmore favorable conditions for the development of its power, than in\r\nother parts of the same ocean; thus showing the importance of regarding\r\nthe established character of storms in each locality, as determined by\r\nobservation. In this connection, also, we may remark, that the meridians\r\nof greatest magnetic intensity are, _ceteris paribus_, also the\r\nmeridians of greatest atmospheric commotion. The discovery of this fact\r\nis due to Capt. Sabine. The cause is explained by the theory.\r\n\r\nAs it is the author's intention to embody the practical application of\r\nthis theory to navigation, with the necessary rules and tables, in a\r\nseparate work, sufficient has been said to familiarize the reader with\r\nthe general idea of a cause external to the earth, as the active motor\r\nin all atmospheric phenomena. We will therefore only allude in a general\r\nway to the principal distinguishing feature of the theory. We say, then,\r\nthat the wind in a storm is not in rotation, and it is a dangerous\r\ndoctrine to teach the navigator. We also assert as distinctly, that the\r\nwind _in_ a storm does not blow from all sides towards the centre, which\r\nis just as dangerous to believe. If it were wise to pin our faith to any\r\nProcrustean formula, we might endorse the following propositions: That\r\nat the beginning of a storm the wind is from the equator towards the\r\npoles in every part of the storm; that, at a later date, another current\r\n(really a polar current deflected by convection) sets in at right angles\r\nto the first one; and that at the end of the storm there is only _one_\r\nwind blowing at right angles to the direction at the beginning. Outside\r\nthe storm, considered as a hundred, or two or three hundred miles in\r\ndiameter, there is, under certain limitations, a surface wind setting\r\ntowards the general focus of motion and condensation, and this surface\r\nwind will be strongest from the westward, on account of the motion of\r\nthe whole atmosphere in which these other motions are performed being to\r\nthe eastward.[9] The whole phenomenon is electrical or magnetic, or\r\nelectro-magnetic or ethereal, whichever name pleases best. The vortex,\r\nby its action, causes a current of induction below, from the equator, as\r\nmay be understood by inspecting Fig. 2, which in the northern hemisphere\r\nbrings in a southerly current by convection: the regular circular\r\ncurrent, however, finally penetrates below, as soon as the process of\r\ninduction has ceased; and thus the polar current of the atmosphere at\r\nlast overcomes the equatorial current in a furious squall, which ceases\r\nby degrees, and the equilibrium is restored.\r\n\r\nEvery locality will have its peculiar features; in each, the prevailing\r\nwind will be at right angles to the magnetic meridian, and the progress\r\nof the storm will tend to follow the magnetic parallel, which is one\r\nreason why the Atlantic and Indian Ocean storms have been mistaken for\r\nprogressive whirlwinds. When these views are developed in full, the\r\nmariner can pretty certainly decide his position in the storm, the\r\ndirection of its progress, and its probable duration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] The specific heat of the ether being a constant factor, it may be\r\ndivided out.\r\n\r\n[4] A term adopted by Prof. Faraday to denote the mode in which bodies\r\nare carried along by an electrical current.\r\n\r\n[5] Ottawa, Ill.\r\n\r\n[6] The principal cause of these waves is, no doubt, due to the\r\nvortices, and the eastern progress of the waves due to the rotating\r\nether; but, at present, it will not be necessary to separate these\r\neffects.\r\n\r\n[7] The inner vortex may reach as high as 83d when the moon's orbit is\r\nfavorably situated.\r\n\r\n[8] The curvature of the earth is more than 10 miles in a distance of\r\n300 miles.\r\n\r\n[9] In middle latitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL ACTION OF THE MOON.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to give the method of determining the latitude of\r\nthe axis of the vortex, at the time of its passage over any given\r\nmeridian, and at any given time. And afterwards we will give a brief\r\nabstract from the record of the weather, for one sidereal period of the\r\nmoon, in order to compare the theory with observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4]\r\n\r\nIn the above figure, the circle PER represents the earth, E the equator,\r\nPP' the poles, T the centre of the earth, C the mechanical centre of the\r\nterral vortex, M the moon, XX' the axis of the vortex, and A the point\r\nwhere the radius vector of the moon pierces the surface of the earth. If\r\nwe consider the axis of the vortex to be the axis of equilibrium in the\r\nsystem, it is evident that TC will be to CM, as the mass of the moon to\r\nthe mass of the earth. Now, if we take these masses respectively as 1 to\r\n72.3, and the moon's mean distance at 238,650 miles, the mean value of\r\nTC is equal to this number, divided by the sum of these masses,--_i.e._\r\nthe mean radius vector of the little orbit, described by the earth's\r\ncentre around the centre of gravity of the earth and moon, is equal\r\n238650/(72.3+1) = 3,256 miles; and at any other distance of the moon, is\r\nequal to that distance, divided by the same sum. Therefore, by taking CT\r\nin the inverse ratio of the mean semi-diameter of the moon to the true\r\nsemi-diameter, we shall have the value of CT at that time. But TA is to\r\nTC as radius to the cosine of the arc AR, and RR' are the points on the\r\nearth's surface pierced by the axis of the vortex, supposing this axis\r\ncoincident with the pole of the lunar orbit. If this were so, the\r\ncalculation would be very short and simple; and it will, perhaps,\r\nfacilitate the investigation, by considering, for the present, that the\r\ntwo axes do coincide.\r\n\r\nIn order, also, to simplify the question, we will consider the earth a\r\nperfect sphere, having a diameter of 7,900 miles, equal to the actual\r\npolar diameter, and therefore TA is equal to 3,950 miles.\r\n\r\nIn the spherical triangle given on next page, we have given the point A,\r\nbeing the position of the moon in right ascension and declination in the\r\nheavens, and considered as terrestrial latitude and longitude.\r\n\r\nTherefore, PA is equal to the complement of the moon's declination, P\r\nbeing the pole of the earth, and L being the pole of the lunar orbit; PL\r\nis equal to the obliquity of the lunar orbit, with respect to the earth,\r\nand is therefore given by finding the true inclination of the lunar\r\norbit at the time, equal EL, (E being the pole of the ecliptic,) also\r\nthe true longitude of the ascending node, and the obliquity of the\r\necliptic PE. Now, as we are supposing the axis of the vortex parallel\r\nto the pole of the lunar orbit, and to pierce the earth's surface at R,\r\nARL will evidently all be in the same plane; and, as in the case of A\r\nand L, this plane passes through the earth's centre, ARL must all lie in\r\nthe same great circle. Having, therefore, the right ascension of A, and\r\nthe right ascension of L, we have the angle P. This gives us two sides,\r\nand the included angle, to find the side LA. But we have before found\r\nthe arc AR; we therefore know LR. But in finding LA, we found both the\r\nangles L and A, and therefore can find PR, which is equal to the\r\ncomplement of the latitude sought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5]\r\n\r\nWe have thus indicated briefly the simple process by which we could find\r\nthe latitude of the axis of the central vortex, supposing it to be\r\nalways coincident with the pole of the lunar orbit. The true problem is\r\nmore complicated, and the principal modifications, indicated by the\r\ntheory, are abundantly confirmed by observation. The determination of\r\nthe inclination of the axis of the vortex, its position in space at a\r\ngiven time, and the law of its motion, was a work of cheerless labor for\r\na long time. He that has been tantalized by hope for years, and ever on\r\nthe eve of realization, has found the vision vanish, can understand the\r\nfeeling which proceeds from frequent disappointment in not finding that,\r\nwhose existence is almost demonstrated; and more especially when the\r\napproximation differs but slightly from the actual phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty at the outset of these investigations, arose from\r\nthe conflicting authority of astronomers in relation to the mass of the\r\nmoon. We are too apt to confound the precision of the laws of nature,\r\nwith the perfection of human theories. Man observes the phenomena of the\r\nheavens, and derives his means of predicting what will be, from what has\r\nbeen. Hence the motions of the heavenly bodies are known to within a\r\ntrifling amount of the truth; but it does not follow that the true\r\nexplanation is always given by theory. If this were so, the mass of the\r\nmoon (for instance) ought to be the same, whether deduced from the\r\nprinciple of gravitation or from some other source. This is not so.\r\nNewton found it 1/40 of that of the earth. La Place, from a profound\r\ntheoretical discussion of the tides, gave it as 1/58.6, while from other\r\nsources he found a necessity of diminishing it still more, to 1/68, and\r\nfinally as low as 1/75. Bailly, Herschel, and others, from the nutation\r\nof the earth's axis, only found 1/80, and the Baron Lindenau deduced the\r\nmass from the same phenomenon 1/88. In a very recent work by Mr. Hind,\r\nhe uses this last value in certain computations, and remarks, that we\r\nshall not be very far wrong in considering it as 1/80 of the mass of the\r\nearth. This shows the uncertainty of the matter in 1852. If astronomy is\r\nso perfect as to determine the parallax of a fixed star, which is almost\r\nalways less than one second, why is it that the mass of the moon is not\r\nmore nearly approximated? Every two weeks the sun's longitude is\r\naffected by the position of the moon, alternately increasing and\r\ndiminishing it, by a quantity depending solely upon the relative mass of\r\nthe earth and moon, and is a gross quantity compared to the parallax of\r\na star. So, also, the horizontal parallax--the most palpable of all\r\nmethods--taken by different observers at Berlin, and the Cape of Good\r\nHope, (a very respectable base line, one would suppose,) makes the mass\r\nof the moon greater than its value derived from nutation; the first\r\ngiving about 1/70, the last about 1/74.2. Does not this declare that it\r\nis unsafe to depend too absolutely on the strict wording of the\r\nNewtonian law of gravitation. Happily our theory furnishes us with the\r\ncorrect value of the moon's mass, written legibly on the surface of the\r\nearth; and it comes out nearly what these two phenomena always gave it,\r\nviz.: 1/72.3 of that of the earth. In another place we shall inquire\r\ninto the cause of the discrepancy as given by the nutation of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTION OF THE AXIS OF THE VORTEX.\r\n\r\nIf the axis of the terral vortex does not coincide with the axis of the\r\nlunar orbit, we must derive this position from observation, which can\r\nonly be done by long and careful attention. This difficulty is increased\r\nby the uncertainty about the mass of the moon, already alluded to, and\r\nby the fact that there are three vortices in each hemisphere which pass\r\nover _twice_ in each month, and it is not _always_ possible to decide by\r\nobservation, whether a vortex is ascending or descending, or even to\r\ndiscriminate between them, so as to be assured that this is the central\r\ndescending, and that the outer vortex ascending. A better acquaintance,\r\nhowever, with the phenomenon, at last dissipates this uncertainty, and\r\nthe vortices are then found to pursue their course with that regularity\r\nwhich varies only according to law. The position of the vortex (the\r\ncentral vortex is the one under consideration) then depends on the\r\ninclination of its axis to the axis of the earth, and the right\r\nascension of that axis at the given time. For we shall see that an\r\nassumed immobility of the axis of the vortex, would be in direct\r\ncollision with the principles of the theory.\r\n\r\nLet the following figure represent a globe of wood of uniform density\r\nthroughout. Let this globe be rotated round the axis. It is evident that\r\nno change of position of the axis would be produced by the rotation. If\r\nwe add two equal masses of lead at m and m', on opposite sides of the\r\naxis, the globe is still in equilibrium, as far as gravity is concerned,\r\nand if perfectly spherical and homogeneous it might be suspended from\r\nits centre in any position, or assume indifferently any position in a\r\nvessel of water. If, however, the globe is now put into a state of rapid\r\nrotation round the axis, and then allowed to float freely in the water,\r\nwe perceive that it is no longer in a state of equilibrium. The mass m\r\nbeing more dense than its antagonist particle at n, and having equal\r\nvelocity, its momentum is greater, and it now tends continually to pull\r\nthe pole from its perpendicular, without affecting the position of the\r\ncentre. The same effect is produced by m', and consequently the axis\r\ndescribes the surface of a double cone, whose vertices are at the centre\r\nof the globe. If these masses of lead had been placed at opposite sides\r\nof the axis on the _equator_ of the globe, no such motion would be\r\nproduced; for we are supposing the globe formed of a hard and unyielding\r\nmaterial. In the case of the ethereal vortex of the earth, we must\r\nremember there are two different kinds of matter,--one ponderable, the\r\nother not ponderable; yet both subject to the same dynamical laws. If we\r\nconsider the axis of the terral vortex to coincide with the axis of the\r\nlunar orbit, the moon and earth are placed in the equatorial plane of\r\nthe vortex, and consequently there can be no derangement of the\r\nequilibrium of the vortex by its own rotation. But even in this case,\r\nseeing that the moon's orbit is inclined to the ecliptic, the\r\ngravitating power of the sun is exerted on the moon, and of necessity\r\nshe must quit the equatorial plane of the vortex; for the sun can exert\r\nno influence on the _matter_ of the vortex by his attracting power. The\r\nmoment, however, the moon has left the equatorial plane of the vortex,\r\nthe principle of momentum comes into play, and a conical motion of the\r\naxis of the vortex is produced, by its seeking to follow the moon in her\r\nmonthly revolution. This case is, however, very different to the\r\nillustration we gave. The vortex is a fluid, through which the moon\r\nfreely wends her way, passing through the equatorial plane of the vortex\r\ntwice in each revolution. These points constitute the moon's nodes on\r\nthe plane of the vortex, and, from the principles laid down, the force\r\nof the moon to disturb the equilibrium of the axis of the vortex,\r\nvanishes at these points, and attains a maximum 90d from them. And the\r\neffect produced, in passing from her ascending to her descending node,\r\nis equal and contrary to the effect produced in passing from her\r\ndescending to her ascending node,--reckoning these points on the plane\r\nof the vortex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6]\r\n\r\n\r\nINCLINATION OF THE AXIS.\r\n\r\nBy whatever means the two planes first became permanently inclined, we\r\nsee that it is a necessary consequence of the admission of these\r\nprinciples, not only that the axis of the vortex should be drawn aside\r\nby the momentum of the earth and moon, ever striving, as it were, to\r\nmaintain a dynamical balance in the system, in accordance with the\r\nsimple laws of motion, and ever disturbed by the action of gravitation\r\nexerted on the grosser matter of the system; but also, that this axis\r\nshould follow, the axis of the lunar orbit, at the same mean\r\ninclination, during the complete revolution of the node. The mean\r\ninclination of the two axes, determined by observation, is 2d 45', and\r\nthe monthly equation, at a maximum, is about 15', being a plus\r\ncorrection in the northern hemisphere, where the moon is between her\r\ndescending and ascending node, reckoned on the plane of the vortex, and\r\na minus correction, when between her ascending and descending node. And\r\nthe mean longitude of the node will be the same as the true longitude of\r\nthe moon's orbit node,--the maximum correction for the true longitude\r\nbeing only about 5d +/-.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7]\r\n\r\nIn the following figure, P is the pole of the earth; E the pole of the\r\necliptic; L the pole of the lunar orbit; V the mean position of the pole\r\nof the vortex at the time; the angle [ARIES]EL the true longitude of the\r\npole of the lunar orbit, equal to the _true_ longitude of the ascending\r\nnode +/- 90d. VL is therefore the mean inclination +/- 2d 45'; and the\r\nlittle circle, the orbit described by the pole of the vortex _twice_ in\r\neach sidereal revolution of the moon. The distance of the pole of the\r\nvortex from the mean position V, may be approximately estimated, by\r\nmultiplying the maximum value 15' by the sine of twice the moon's\r\ndistance from the node of the vortex, or from its mean position, viz.:\r\nthe true longitude of the ascending node of the moon on the ecliptic.\r\nFrom this we may calculate the true place of the node, the true\r\nobliquity, and the true inclination to the lunar orbit. Having indicated\r\nthe necessity for this correction, and its numerical coefficient, we\r\nshall no longer embarrass the computation by such minutiae, but consider\r\nthe mean inclination as the true inclination, and the mean place of the\r\nnode as the true place of the node, and coincident with the ascending\r\nnode of the moon's orbit on the ecliptic.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF THE AXIS OF THE VORTEX.\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to prove that the axis of the vortex will still pass\r\nthrough the centre of gravity of the earth and moon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8]\r\n\r\nLet XX now represent the axis of the lunar orbit, and C the centre of\r\ngravity of the earth and moon, X'X' the axis of the vortex, and KCR the\r\ninclination of this axis. Then from\r\n\r\n  similarity  Ct :  Tt ::      Cm     :      Mm\r\n     but      Tt :  Mm :: Moon's mass : Earth's mass.\r\n  That is     Tt :  Mm ::      TC     :      MC.\r\n\r\nTherefore the system is still balanced; and in no other point but the\r\npoint C, can the intersection of the axes be made without destroying\r\nthis balance.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed by inspecting the figure, that the arc R'K' is\r\ngreater than the arc RK. That the first increases the arc AR, and the\r\nsecond diminishes that arc. The arc R'K' is a plus correction therefore,\r\nand the smaller arc RK a minus correction. If the moon is between her\r\ndescending and ascending node, (taking now the node on the ecliptic,)\r\nthe correction is negative, and we take the smaller arc. If the moon is\r\nbetween her ascending and descending node, the correction is positive,\r\nand we take the larger arc. If the moon is 90d from the node, the\r\ncorrection is a maximum. If the moon is at the node, the correction is\r\nnull. In all other positions it is as the sine of the moon's distance\r\nfrom the nodes. We must now find the maximum value of these arcs of\r\ncorrection corresponding to the mean inclination of 2d 45'.\r\n\r\nTo do this we may reduce TC to Tt in the ratio of radius to cosine of\r\nthe inclination, and taking TS for radius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9]\r\n\r\n{TC x Cos &c. (inclination 2d 45')}/R is equal the cosine of the arc SK'\r\nand SK' + AS = AK' and AK' + AR' = R'K'. But from the nature of the\r\ncircle, arc RK + arc R'K' = angle RCK + angle R'CK', or equal to double\r\nthe inclination; and therefore, by subtracting either arc from double\r\nthe inclination, we may get the other arc.\r\n\r\nThe maximum value of these arcs can, however, be found by a simple\r\nproportion, by saying; as the arc AR, plus the inclination, is to the\r\ninclination, so is the inclination to the difference between them; and\r\ntherefore, the inclination, plus half the difference, is equal the\r\ngreater arc, and the inclination, minus half the difference, is equal\r\nthe lesser; the greater being positive, and the lesser negative.\r\n\r\nHaving found the arc AR, and knowing the moon's distance from either\r\nnode, we must reduce these values of the arcs RK and R'K' just found, in\r\nthe ratio of radius to the sine of that distance, and apply it to the\r\narc AR or A'R', and we shall get the first correction equal to the\r\narc AK or AK'.\r\n\r\n  Call the arc AR                 = a\r\n      \"    inclination            = n\r\n      \"    distance from the node = d\r\n      \"    arc AK                 = k\r\n\r\nand supposing the value of AK be wanted for the northern hemisphere when\r\nthe moon is between her descending and ascending node, we have\r\n\r\n                 n^2\r\n               -------\r\n                a + n\r\n          (n - ------- ) sin d.\r\n                  2\r\n  k = a - ----------------------\r\n                   R\r\n\r\nIf the moon is between her ascending and descending node, then\r\n\r\n                 n^2\r\n               -------\r\n                a + n\r\n          (n - ------- ) sin d.\r\n                  2\r\n  k = a + ----------------------\r\n                   R\r\n\r\nThe computation will be shorter, however, if we merely reduce the\r\ninclination to the sine of the distance from the node for the first\r\ncorrection of the arc AR, if we neglect the semi-monthly motion of the\r\naxis; for this last correction diminishes the plus corrections, and the\r\nfirst one increases it. If, therefore, one is neglected, it is better to\r\nneglect the other also; especially as it might be deemed affectation to\r\nnotice trifling inequalities in the present state of the elements of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThere is one inequality, however, which it will not do to neglect. This\r\narises from the displacement of the axis of the vortex.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPLACEMENT OF THE AXIS.\r\n\r\nWe have represented the axis of the terral vortex as continually passing\r\nthrough the centre of gravity of the earth and moon. Now, by following\r\nout the principles of the theory, we shall see that this cannot be the\r\ncase, except when the moon is in quadrature with the sun. To explain\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10]\r\n\r\nLet the curve passing through C represent a portion of the orbit of the\r\nearth, and S the sun. From the principles laid down, the density of the\r\nethereal medium increases outward as the square roots of the distances\r\nfrom the sun. Now, if we consider the circle whose centre is C to\r\nrepresent the whole terral vortex, it must be that the medium composing\r\nit varies also in density at different distances from the sun, and at\r\nthe same time is rotating round the centre. That half of the vortex\r\nwhich is exterior to the orbit of the earth, being most dense, has\r\nconsequently most inertia, and if we conceive the centre of gravity of\r\nthe earth and moon to be in the orbit (as it must be) at C, there will\r\nnot be dynamical balance in the terral system, if the centre of the\r\nvortex is also found at C. To preserve the equilibrium the centre of the\r\nvortex will necessarily come nearer the sun, and thus be found between T\r\nand C, T representing the earth, and [MOON] the moon, and C the centre of\r\ngravity of the two bodies. If the moon is in opposition, the centre of\r\nthe vortex will fall between the centre of gravity and the centre of the\r\nearth, and have the apparent effect of diminishing the mass of the moon.\r\nIf, on the other hand, the moon is in conjunction, the centre of the\r\nvortex will fall between the centre of gravity and the moon, and have\r\nthe apparent effect of increasing the mass of the moon. If the moon is\r\nin quadrature, the effect will be null. The coefficient of this\r\ninequality is 90', and depends on the sun's distance from the moon. When\r\nthe moon is more than 90d from the sun, this correction is positive, and\r\nwhen less than 90d from the sun, it is negative. If we call this second\r\ncorrection C, and the moon's distance from her quadratures Q, we have\r\nthe value of C = +/-(90' x sin Q)/R.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11]\r\n\r\nThis correction, however, does not affect the inclination of the axis of\r\nthe vortex, as will be understood by the subjoined figure. If the moon\r\nis in opposition, the axis of the vortex will not pass through C, but\r\nthrough C', and QQ' will be parallel to KK'. If the moon is in\r\nconjunction, the axis will be still parallel to KK', as represented by\r\nthe dotted line qq'. The correction, therefore, for displacement, is\r\nequal to the arc KQ or Kq, and the correct position of the vortex on the\r\nsurface of the earth at a given time will be at the points Q or q and Q'\r\nor q', considering the earth as a sphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12]\r\n\r\nIn the spherical triangle APV, P is the pole of the earth, V the pole of\r\nthe vortex, A the point of the earth's surface pierced by the radius\r\nvector of the moon, AQ is the corrected arc, and PV is the obliquity of\r\nthe vortex. Now, as the axis of the vortex is parallel to the pole V,\r\nand the earth's centre, and the line MA also passes through the earth's\r\ncentre, consequently AQV will all lie in the same great circle, and as\r\nPV is known, and PA is equal to the complement of the moon's declination\r\nat the time, and the right, ascensions of A and V give the angle P, we\r\nhave two sides and the included angle to find the rest, PQ being the\r\ncomplement of the latitude sought.\r\n\r\nWe will now give an example of the application of these principles.\r\n\r\n_Example._[10] Required the latitude of the central vortex at the time\r\nof its meridian passage in longitude 88d 50' west, July 2d, 1853.\r\n\r\nCENTRAL VORTEX ASCENDING.\r\n\r\n  Greenwich time of passage           2d. 3h. 1m.\r\n  Mean longitude of moon's node       78d 29'\r\n  True     \"              \"           79  32\r\n  Mean inclination of lunar orbit      5   9\r\n  True     \"              \"            5  13\r\n  Obliquity of ecliptic               23  27  32\"\r\n  Mean inclination of vortex           2  45   0\r\n\r\nThen in the spherical triangle PEV,\r\n\r\n  PE   is equal   23d 27' 32\"\r\n  EV      \"        7  58   0\r\n  E       \"      100  28   0\r\n  P       \"       18   5   7\r\n  PV      \"       26   2  32\r\n\r\nCalling P the polar angle and PV the obliquity of vortex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13]\r\n\r\nTo find the arc AR.\r\n\r\nBy combining the two proportions already given, we have by logarithms:\r\n\r\n  M.R.V. minor        =     3256  Log.     3.512683\r\n  M.S.D. of moon      =     940\"   \"       2.973128\r\n  P.S.D. of earth     =     3950 A.

It is convenient to regard it thus, and afterwards make\r\nthe correction for protuberance. We will now indicate the process for\r\nobtaining this correction by the aid of the following diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15]\r\n\r\nLet B bisect the chord ZZ'. Then, by geometry, the angle FQY is equal to\r\nthe angle BTF, and the protuberance FY is equal the sine of that angle,\r\nmaking QF radius. This angle, made by the axis of the vortex and the\r\nsurface of the sphere, is commonly between 30d and 40d, according as the\r\nmoon is near her apogee or perigee; and the correction will be greatest\r\nwhen the angle is least, as at the apogee. At the equator, the whole\r\nprotuberance of the earth is about 13 miles. Multiply this by the cosine\r\nof the angle and divide by the sine, and we shall get the value of the\r\narc QY for the equator. For the smallest angle, when the correction is a\r\nmaximum, this correction will be about 20' of latitude at the equator;\r\nfor other latitudes it is diminished as the squares of the cosines of\r\nthe latitude. Then add this amount to the latitude EQ, equal the\r\nlatitude EY. This, however, is only correct when the axis of the vortex\r\nis in the same plane as the axis of the earth; it is, therefore, subject\r\nto a minus correction, which can be found by saying, as radius to cosine\r\nof obliquity so is the correction to a fourth--the difference of these\r\ncorrections is the maximum minus correction, and needs reducing in the\r\nratio of radius to the cosine of the angle of the moon's distance from\r\nthe node; but as it can only amount to about 2' at a maximum under the\r\nmost favorable circumstances, it is not necessary to notice it. The\r\ncorrection previously noticed is on the supposition that the earth is\r\nlike a sphere having TF for radius; as it is a spheroid, we must correct\r\nagain. From the evolute, draw the line SF, and parallel to it, draw TW;\r\nthen EW is the latitude of the point F on the surface of the spheroid.\r\nThis second correction is also a plus correction, subject to the same\r\nerror as the first on account of the obliquity, its maximum value for an\r\nangle of 30d is about 6', and is greatest in latitude 45d; for other\r\nlatitudes, it is equal {6' x sin(double the lat.)}/R.\r\n\r\nThe three principal corrections for protuberance may be _estimated_ from\r\nthe following table, calculated for every 15d of latitude for an angle\r\nof 30d, or when the correction is greatest.\r\n\r\n  Latitude.    1st Corr.    2d Corr.     3d Corr.\r\n     0           + 20'        + 0          - 2\r\n    15           + 19         + 3          - 1.5\r\n    30           + 15         + 5          - 1.5\r\n    45           + 10         + 6          - 1.\r\n    60           +  5         + 5          - 1\r\n    70           +  1         + 3          - 0.5\r\n\r\nWe can now apply this correction to the latitude of the vortex just\r\nfound:\r\n\r\n  Latitude on the sphere           42d 45' 38\" n.\r\n  Correction for protuberance       +  14  22\r\n                                   ----------\r\n  Correct latitude                 43  00  00\r\n\r\n\r\nMILWAUKIE STORM, JULY 2.\r\n\r\nAs this example was calculated about ten days before the actual date, we\r\nhave appended an extract from the Milwaukie papers, which is in the same\r\nlongitude as Ottawa, in which place the calculation was made. It is\r\nneedless to remark that the latitude of Milwaukie corresponds to the\r\ncalculated latitude of the centre of the vortex. It is not intended,\r\nhowever, to convey the idea that the central line is always the most\r\nsubject to the greatest violence--a storm may have several centres or\r\nnuclei of disturbance, which are frequently waning and reviving as the\r\nstorm progresses. Generally speaking, however, the greatest action is\r\ndeveloped along the line previously passed over by the axis of the\r\nvortex.\r\n\r\n    \"SUMMIT, Waukesha Co., Wis., July 4, 1853.\r\n\r\n    \"Our town, on Saturday, the 2d, was visited by a terrible storm,\r\n    which will long be remembered by those who witnessed its effects and\r\n    suffered from its fury. It arose in the south-west, and came\r\n    scowling in blackness, sufficient to indicate its anger, for the\r\n    space of eighty or a hundred rods in _width_, covering our usually\r\n    quiet village; and for nearly half an hour's duration, the rain fell\r\n    in torrents, the heavens blazed with the lightning's flashes, trees\r\n    fell and were uprooted by the fury of the blast, fragments of gates\r\n    and of buildings, shingles, roof-boards, rafters, circled through\r\n    the air, the playthings of the wind--and buildings themselves were\r\n    moved entire from their foundations, and deposited at different\r\n    distances from their original positions. A barn, fifty-five feet\r\n    square on the ground, owned by Mr. B. R. Hinckley, is moved from its\r\n    position some ten feet to the eastward; and a house, some fifteen by\r\n    eighteen feet on the ground, owned by the same person, fronting the\r\n    east, was driven by the wind to the opposite side of the street, and\r\n    now fronts nearly west; and what is most strange, is that the grass,\r\n    in the route the house must have passed over, stands straight as\r\n    usual, and gives no evidence that the building was pushed along on\r\n    the ground. A lady running from a house unroofed by the storm, took\r\n    an aerial flight over two fences, and finally caught against a tree,\r\n    which arrested her passage for a moment only, when, giving way, she\r\n    renewed her journey for a few rods, and was set down unhurt in\r\n    Mr. O. Reed's wheat field, where, clinging to the growing grain, she\r\n    remained till the gale went by.\"[11]\r\n\r\nThe weather at this place is briefly recorded in the accompanying\r\nabstract from the journal, as well as in an extract from a note to\r\nProfessor Henry, of the Smithsonian Institution, from a friend of the\r\nauthors, who has long occupied a high official station in Illinois. But\r\nsuch coincidences are of no value in deciding on the merits of such a\r\ntheory, it must be tried before the tribunal of the world, and applied\r\nto phenomena in other countries with success, before its merits can be\r\nfully appreciated. The accompanying record, therefore, is only given to\r\nshow how these vortices render themselves apparent, and what ought to be\r\nobserved, and also to exhibit the order of their recurrence and their\r\npositions at a given time.\r\n\r\n_Extract of a note addressed to the Secretary of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, by Hon. John Dean Caton, on this subject._\r\n\r\n    \"As a striking instance of the remarkable coincidences confirmatory\r\n    of these calculations, I will state, that on Friday, the first of\r\n    July last, this gentleman[12] stated that on the next day a storm\r\n    would pass north of us, being central a little south of Milwaukie,\r\n    and that he thought, from the state of the atmosphere, the storm\r\n    would be severe, and that its greatest violence would be felt on the\r\n    afternoon or night of the next day. At this time the weather was\r\n    fine, without any indications of a storm, so far as I could judge.\r\n    At noon on the following day he pointed out the indications of a\r\n    storm at the north and north-west, consisting of a dark, hazy belt\r\n    in that direction, extending up a few degrees above the horizon,\r\n    although so indistinct as to have escaped my observation. At five\r\n    o'clock a violent storm visited us, which lasted half an hour,\r\n    although a clear sky was visible at the south the whole time. On\r\n    Monday morning I learned, from the telegraph office at Chicago, that\r\n    early on Saturday afternoon communication with Milwaukie had been\r\n    interrupted by atmospheric electricity, and that the line had been\r\n    broken by a storm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK STORM.\r\n\r\nAfter this was written, the author discovered that the vortex was\r\nequally violent the day before at New York, July 1st, 1853. An account\r\nof this storm follows. The calculation has not been made, but it is easy\r\nto perceive that the latitude of the vortex, on July 1st, must be very\r\nnearly that of New York--being in latitude 43d next day and ascending.\r\n\r\n\"At a meeting of the American Association, convened at Cleveland,\r\nProfessor Loomis presented a long notice of the terrible hail storm in\r\nNew York on the 1st of July. He traced its course, and minutely examined\r\nall the phenomena relating to it, from a mile and a half south-east of\r\nPaterson, N.J., to the east side of Long Island, where it appeared\r\nnearly to have spent its force. It passed over the village of Aqueenac,\r\nstriking the Island of New York in the vicinity of the Crystal Palace.\r\nIt was not much more than half a mile wide. The size of the hail-stones\r\nwas almost incredibly large, many of them being as large as a hen's egg,\r\nand the Professor saw several which he thought as large as his fist.\r\nSome of them weighed nearly half a pound. The principal facts in\r\nrelation to this storm were published at the time, and need not be\r\nrepeated. The discussions arising among the members as to the origin and\r\nthe size of these hail-stones, and the phenomena of the storm, were\r\nexceedingly interesting. They were participated in by Professors Heustus\r\nand Hosford, of Cambridge University, Professor Loomis, and Professors\r\nBache and Redfield. The latter two gentlemen differ somewhat, we should\r\nsuppose radically, in their meteorological theories, and had some very\r\nsharp but very pleasant \"shooting\" between them.\"[13]\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL VORTEX DESCENDING.\r\n\r\nWe will now make the calculation for the central vortex _descending_,\r\nfor longitude 88d 50' west, August 7, 1853,--putting down the necessary\r\nelements for the time of the meridian passage in order:\r\n\r\n  Meridian passage in local time at              2h. 25m.

The\r\nfollowing is from the record of the weather:\r\n\r\n_August_ 6th. Very fine and clear all day; wind from S.-W.; a light\r\nbreeze; 8 P.M. frequent flashes of lightning in the northern sky;\r\n10 P.M. a _low bank of dense clouds in north_, fringed with cirri,\r\nvisible during the flash of the lightning; 12 P.M. same continues.\r\n\r\n7th. Very line and clear morning; wind S.-W. moderate; noon, clouds\r\naccumulating in the northern half of the sky; wind fresher S.-W.; 3 P.M.\r\na clap of thunder overhead, and black cumuli in west, north, and east;\r\n4 P.M. much thunder, and scattered showers; six miles west rained very\r\nheavily; 6 P.M. the heavy clouds passing over to the south; 10 P.M.\r\nclear again in north.\r\n\r\n_August_ 8th. Clear all day; wind the same (S.-W.); a hazy bank visible\r\nall along on _southern horizon_.\r\n\r\nThis was not a storm, in the ordinary acceptation of the term; but the\r\nsame cause, under other circumstances, would have produced one; and let\r\nit be borne in mind, that although the moon is the chief disturbing\r\ncause, and the passages of the vortices are the periods of greatest\r\ncommotion in both settled and unsettled weather, still the sun is\r\npowerful in predisposing the circumstances, whether favorable or\r\nunfavorable; and as there is no periodic connection between the passage\r\nof a vortex and the concurrence of the great atmospheric waves, it will,\r\nof course, happen only occasionally that all the circumstances will\r\nconspire to make a storm. There are also other modifying causes, to\r\nwhich we have not yet alluded, which influence the storms at different\r\nseasons of the year,--exaggerating their activity in some latitudes, and\r\ndiminishing it in other latitudes. In this latitude, the months of May,\r\nJune, and July are marked by more energetic action than August,\r\nSeptember, and October. The activity of one vortex also, in one place,\r\nseems to modify the activity of another vortex in another place. But the\r\ngreat question to decide is: Do these vortices really exist? Do they\r\nfollow each other in the _order_ indicated by the theory? Do they pass\r\nfrom south to north, and from north to south, at the _times_ indicated\r\nby the theory? Do they obey, in their monthly revolutions, a\r\nmathematical law connecting them with the motions of the moon? We answer\r\nemphatically, Yes! And the non-discovery of these facts, is one of the\r\nmost humiliating features of the present age.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTTOWA STORM, DECEMBER 22, 1852.\r\n\r\nTo show that the same calculations are applicable for other times, we\r\nwill make the calculation for the _centre ascending_, for the 22d\r\nDecember, 1852, taking the following elements:\r\n\r\n  Moon's mer. passage, Dec. 22d        15h. 16m.

Wind N.-E., fine\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n_Dec._ 22d. Thick, hazy morning, wind east, much lighter in S.-E. than\r\nin N.-W.; 8 A.M., a clear arch in S.-E. getting more to south; noon,\r\nvery black in W. N.-W.; above, a broken layer of cir. cumulus, the sun\r\nvisible sometimes through the waves; wind round to S.-E., and fresher;\r\ngetting thicker all day; 10 P.M., wind south, strong; thunder,\r\nlightning, and heavy rain all night, with strong squalls from south.\r\n\r\n_Dec._ 23d. Wind S.-W., moderate, drizzly day; 10 P.M., wind west, and\r\ngetting clearer.\r\n\r\nThe next day the vortex passed the latitude of Montreal (the moon being\r\non the meridian about 10 P.M.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETIC STORM, DECEMBER 23, 1852.\r\n\r\nIn the July number of Vol. XVI. of Silliman's Journal, we find certain\r\nnotices of the weather in 1852, by Charles Smallwood, of St. Martins,\r\nnine miles east of Montreal. He mentions \"two remarkable electrical\r\nstorms (which) occurred on the 23d and 31st of December, (in which)\r\nsparks 5/40 of an inch were constantly passing from the conductor to the\r\ndischarger for several hours each day.\" At 10 P.M. (23d) the vortex\r\npassed over Montreal, and again descending on the 31st North, and was\r\nvisible at Ottowa on the morning of the 1st of January, with southerly\r\nwind setting towards it. On the 29th of December, Mr. Smallwood records\r\n\"a low auroral arch, sky clear.\" On the 20th, the vortex was 5d to the\r\nnorthward of Montreal, and the aurora was consequently low--the\r\nbrightest auroras being when the vortex is immediately north without\r\nstorm, or one day to the northward, although we have seen it _very low_\r\nwhen the vortex was three days to the north, and no other vortex near.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVERPOOL STORM.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 24th of December, the same central vortex ascending\r\npassed between Cape Clear and Liverpool.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th, at midnight, the vortex passed to the north of Liverpool:\r\nits northerly progress being very slow, being confined for three days\r\nbetween the parallel of Liverpool and its extreme northern limit in\r\nlatitude about 57d. The accompanying account of the weather will show\r\nthe result of a long-continued disturbance near the same latitude:\r\n\r\nThe Baltic, three days out from Liverpool, encountered the vortex on the\r\nnight of the 23d. On the morning of the 25th, very early, the gale\r\ncommenced at Liverpool, and did much damage. On the 26th, the vortex\r\nattained its northern limit; but we have not been able to procure any\r\naccount of its effects to the northward of Liverpool, although there can\r\nbe but little doubt that it was violent on the coast of Scotland on the\r\n26th; for the next day (27th) the vortex having made the turn, was near\r\nthe latitude of Liverpool, and caused a _tremendous_ storm, thus showing\r\na continued state of activity for several days, or a peculiarly\r\nfavorable local atmosphere in those parts. It is very probable, also,\r\nthat there was a conjunction of the central and inner vortex on the\r\n27th. The inner vortex precedes the central in passing latitude 41d; but\r\nas the mean radius of its orbit is less than that of the central, it\r\nattains to a higher latitude, and has, consequently, to cross the path\r\nof the central, in order again to precede it descending in latitude 41d.\r\nAs a very trifling change in the elements of the problem will cause\r\ngreat changes in the positions of the vortices on the surface of the\r\nearth, it cannot now be asserted that such a conjunction did positively\r\noccur at that time; but, it maybe suspected, that a double disturbance\r\nwould produce a greater commotion, or, in other words, a more violent,\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nIt is on this account, combined with other auxiliary causes, that the\r\nvicinity of Cape Horn is so proverbially stormy, as well as for the low\r\nstandard of the barometer in that latitude, it is the stationary point\r\nof the vortices in ordinary positions of the nodes and perigee of the\r\nmoon. We have already alluded to the fact, that none of the vortices\r\nscarcely ever pass much beyond latitude 80d, and then only under\r\nfavorable circumstances, so that we ought to infer, that gales in high\r\nlatitudes should set from the poles towards the storms in lower\r\nlatitudes. This is, no doubt, the fact, but, nevertheless, a hard\r\nsoutherly blow _may possibly_ occur in high northern latitudes, if a\r\nstorm should be raging very violently in a lower latitude on the\r\nopposite side of the pole, the distance across the circle of 80d being\r\nonly about 1,400 miles. As the different vortices have a different limit\r\nin latitude every year, the determination of this turning point is\r\nobviously of great practical utility, as the fact may yet be connected\r\nwith other phenomena, so as to give us the probable character of the\r\npolar ice at any assigned time. On this point we have more to say.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSAGES OF ALL THE VORTICES.\r\n\r\nOur remarks have hitherto been confined to the central vortex. We shall\r\nnow show from the record, that the other vortices are as effective in\r\nderanging the equilibrium of our atmosphere. In the following table we\r\nhave given the passages of the different vortices, which will serve as\r\ntheir true positions within moderate limits, to calculate from, for all\r\nfuture time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSAGES OF THE CENTRAL AND LATERAL VORTICES, OBSERVED IN JUNE AND JULY,\r\n1853, IN LATITUDE 41d 20' NORTH.\r\n\r\nI signifying Inner; O, outer; C, central; A, ascending; D, descending.\r\n\r\n   ____________________________________________________________________\r\n  |       |       |         |          |        |                      |\r\n  | Order.|Vortex.|  Date.  | Meridian |Passage.| Calculated latitude  |\r\n  |       |       |         | Passage. |        |   and Remarks.       |\r\n  |_______|_______|_________|__________|________|______________________|\r\n  |       |       |         |          |        |                      |\r\n  |  1st  | I.

It was quite moderate in the lower\r\npart of the town, and probably scarcely felt on Staten Island. The whole\r\naffair lasted not more than a quarter of an hour, yet the results were\r\nmost disastrous, as will be seen by the following accounts from our\r\nreporters:\r\n\r\n\"Happening to be in the neighborhood of the Palace about 5 o'clock\r\nFriday evening, we sought shelter under its ample roof from an impending\r\nthunder storm, of very threatening appearance, rapidly approaching from\r\nthe west. We had scarcely passed the northern entrance, and reached the\r\ngallery by the nearest flight of steps, when the torrent--it was not\r\nrain, but an avalanche of water--struck the building; the gutters were\r\nfilled on the windward side in a moment, and poured over an almost\r\nunbroken sheet of water, which was driven through the Venetian blind\r\nventilators, into and half way across the north-west gallery, and also\r\nthrough the upper ventilators, falling upon the main floor of the north\r\ntransept. Workmen hastened to close the blinds, but that did not prevent\r\nthe deluge. The tinning of the dome being unfinished, the water, of\r\ncourse, came down in showers all over the centre. Many workmen were\r\nengaged on the dome when the shower struck it; several of them, in their\r\nhaste to escape such dangerous proximity to the terrific lightning, came\r\ndown single ropes, hand over hand. Large number of workmen were engaged\r\nall over the exterior, and such a scampering will rarely be witnessed\r\nbut once in a lifetime. It was found impossible to close a north window,\r\nused for ingress and egress of workmen upon the rod, and the water came\r\nin, in almost solid columns. For a time the water was nearly two inches\r\ndeep on the gallery floor, and poured down the stairs in miniature\r\ncascades.\r\n\r\n\"A great number of boxes, bales, and packages of goods lay upon the main\r\nfloor, among which the water poured down from the edge of the gallery\r\nfloor in destructive quantities; Fortunately but few goods were opened,\r\nand were upon the tables, or the damage would have been irreparable. As\r\nit is, we fear some of the goods are injured. In the height of the\r\nstorm, the centre portion of the fanlight over the western entrance\r\nburst in, and several single lights were broken, by staging or\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n\"About ten minutes after the storm burst, the most terrific hailstorm we\r\never saw began to rattle, like discharges of musketry, upon the tin roof\r\nand glass sides. Some of the masses of ice were as large as hen's eggs.\r\nThere were probably a thousand excited workmen in the building, and a\r\ngood many exhibitors and visitors, among whom there were some twenty\r\nladies, some of whom appeared a good deal alarmed at the awful din. A\r\nportion of the frame-work of the addition next to 42d street, went down\r\nwith a terrible crash, and a part of the brick wall of the engine-house\r\non the opposite side of the street, was blown over, crushing two or\r\nthree shanties, fortunately without any other injury than driving the\r\noccupants out into the storm. But an awful scene occurred on the north\r\nside of 43d street, directly opposite the Latting Tower. Here two large\r\nunfinished frame buildings were blown, or rather, we should judge from\r\nappearances, were crushed down into a mass of ruins, such as may be\r\nimagined by supposing a great weight had fallen, with a circular,\r\ngrinding motion, upon the first fine fabrics. One of them was partly\r\nsided, and had the rafters up, but no roof; the other was sided and\r\nrooted with tin, and was being plastered. We were told it was three\r\nstories high, 50 by 98 feet.\r\n\r\n\"We reached the ruins among the first, after the burst of the storm\r\nsubsided a little. The scene was such as we pray God we may never\r\nwitness again. A small portion of the roof and upper part of the front\r\nof the building stood or rather partly hung over the side-walk. The\r\nchamber and lower floor of the front rooms lay flat together. The sides\r\nwere standing. In the rear all were down. In this building, besides the\r\nworkmen, there were numerous laborers who had taken shelter under its\r\nroof when the storm drove them hurriedly from their work. How so many\r\npersons escaped death is truly wonderful. It can only be accounted for\r\nby supposing that they had a moment's warning, and rushed into the\r\nstreet. The first alarm was from the tearing off a portion of the tin\r\nroof, which was carried high over another building, and fell in the\r\nstreet. A horse and cart barely escaped being buried under this. It\r\nseems the frame of the other building came down with a deafening crash\r\nat the same time, confusing instead of warning those in danger. At any\r\nrate, before they could escape, they were buried in a mass of timber,\r\nand three of them instantly killed, and four or five dangerously\r\nwounded; and others slightly bruised and badly frightened. Several would\r\nhave perished but for timely assistance to extricate them. In this they\r\nwere greatly assisted by Jacob Steinant, boss carpenter of the Tower,\r\nwho with his men rushed to the rescue, notwithstanding the pouring down\r\ntorrents.\r\n\r\n\"In Williamsburgh, the storm lasted about fifteen minutes, doing an\r\nincalculable amount of damage to dwellings, foliage, &c. Hailstones came\r\ndown in sizes from that of a hickory-nut to a large apple, some with\r\nsuch force as to drive them through the cloth awnings.\r\n\r\n\"The storm passed over Brooklyn lightly, in comparison with the effects\r\nacross the Williamsburgh line. On Flushing avenue, beyond the Naval\r\nHospital, a number of trees were uprooted, and the window-panes of the\r\nhouses shattered. On the corner of Fulton and Portland avenues, three\r\nbuildings were unroofed, and the walls of the houses were sprung to the\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\n\"On Spencer street, a new frame building was levelled with the ground.\r\nAlong Myrtle, Classon, and other streets and avenues of East Brooklyn,\r\nmany of the shade trees were uprooted, and the windows smashed. In Jay\r\nstreet, two trees were struck by lightning, but no other damage ensued.\r\n\r\n\"Several schooners at the foot of Jay street were forced from their\r\nmoorings, but were soon after secured. A small frame house in Spencer\r\nstreet, just put under roof, was prostrated to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"We understand that a large barn filled with hay, situated on the road\r\nbetween Bushwick and Flushing, was struck by lightning and destroyed\r\nwith its contents, embracing several head of live stock.\"[20]\r\n\r\n_July_ 10th, 3 A.M. Overcast and much lightning in south (N. mod.);\r\n7 A.M., clear except in south; 6 P.M. (E.); 10 P.M., lightning south;\r\n11 P.M., auroral rays long but faint, converging to a point between\r\nEpsilon Virginis and Denebola, in west; low down in west thick with\r\nhaze; on the north the rays converged to a point still lower; lightning\r\nstill visible in south. This is an aurora in the west.\r\n\r\n11th. Fine clear morning (N.-E.); same all day; no lightning visible\r\nto-night, but a bank of clouds low down in south, 2d high, and streaks\r\nof dark stratus below the upper margin.\r\n\r\n12th. Fine and clear (N.-E.); noon, a well defined arch in S.-W., rising\r\nslowly; the bank yellowish, with prismatic shades of greenish yellow on\r\nits borders. This is the O. A. At 6 P.M., the bank spreading to the\r\nnorthward. At 9 P.M., thick bank of haze in north, with bright auroral\r\nmargin; one heavy pyramid of light passed through Cassiopaea, travelling\r\n_westward_ 1 1/2d per minute. This moves to the other side of the pole,\r\nbut not more inclined towards it than is due to prospective, if the\r\nshaft is very long; 11.10 P.M., saw a mass of light more diffuse due\r\neast, reaching to _Markab_, then on the prime vertical. It appears\r\nevident this is seen in profile, as it inclines downwards at an angle of\r\n10d or 12d from the perpendicular. It does not seem very distant.\r\n12 P.M., the aurora still bright, but the brightest part is now west of\r\nthe pole, before it was east.\r\n\r\n13th, 6 A.M. Clear, east and north; bank of cirrus in N.-W., _i.e._,\r\nfrom N.-N.-E. to W. by S.; irregular branches of cirrus clouds, reaching\r\nalmost to south-eastern horizon; wind changed (S.-E. fresh); 8 A.M., the\r\nsky a perfect picture; heavy regular shafts of dense cirrus radiating\r\nall around, and diverging from a thick nucleus in north-west, the spaces\r\nbetween being of clear blue sky. The shafts are rotating from north to\r\nsouth, the nucleus advancing eastward.\r\n\r\nAppearance of the central vortex descending at 8 A.M., July 13th, 1853:\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 18, the circle represents the whole sky from the zenith to the\r\nhorizon, yet it can convey but a very faint idea of the regularity and\r\nvividness of this display. The reflected image of the sky was received\r\nfrom a vessel of turbid water, which will be found better than a mirror,\r\nwhen the wind will permit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18]\r\n\r\nAt noon (same day) getting thicker (S.-E. very fresh); 6 P.M., moon on\r\nmeridian, a prismatic gloom in south, and very thick stratus of all\r\nshades; 9 P.M., very gloomy; wind stronger (S.-E.): 10 P.M., very black\r\nin south, and overcast generally.\r\n\r\n14th. Last night about 12 P.M. commenced raining; 3 A.M., rained\r\nsteadily; 7 A.M., same weather; 8.20 A.M., a line of low storm-cloud, or\r\nseud, showing very sharp and white on the dark back ground all along the\r\nsouthern sky. This line continues until noon about 10d at the highest,\r\nshowing the northern boundary of the storm to the southward; 8 P.M.,\r\nsame bank visible, although in rapid motion eastward; same time clear\r\noverhead, with cirrus fringe pointing north from the bank; much\r\nlightning in south (W. fresh); so ends.\r\n\r\n15th. Last night a black squall from N.-W. passed south without rain; at\r\n3 A.M. clear above, but very black in south (calm below all the time);\r\n9 A.M., the bank in south again throwing off rays of cirri in a\r\nwell-defined arch, whose vortex is south: these pass east, but continue\r\nto form and preserve their linear direction to the north; no lightning\r\nin south to-night.\r\n\r\n16th. Clear all day, without a stain, and calm.\r\n\r\n17th. Fine and clear (N.-E. light); 6 P.M., calm.\r\n\r\n18th. Fair and cloudy (N.-E. light); 6 P.M., calm.\r\n\r\n19th. Fine and clear (N. fresh); I. V. visible in S.-W.\r\n\r\n20th. 8 A.M., bank in N.-W. with beautiful cirrus radiations; 10 A.M.,\r\ngetting thick with dense plates of cream-colored cirrus visible through\r\nthe breaks; gloomy looking all day (N.-E. light).[21]\r\n\r\nAppearance of the Inner Vortex at 8 A.M., July 20th, 1853, including the\r\nwhole sky. (See Fig. 19.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19]\r\n\r\nThis was a different passage of the Inner Vortex ascending as compared\r\nwith the same 28 days before. At that date (June 22) it did great damage\r\nin the central parts of Illinois. Still this last passage was very\r\npalpable--the clouds were very irregularly assorted--plates of cirrus\r\nabove and beneath cumulus--various kinds of cirrus clouds, and that\r\npeculiar prismatic haze which is a common sign of the passage of a\r\nvortex. The appearance depicted above is a very common, although a very\r\nevanescent appearance. When the sky appears of a clear blue through the\r\ncirri, there will be generally fresh gales without any great electrical\r\nderangement; but if the clear spaces are hazy, gradually thickening\r\ntowards the nucleus, a storm may be expected. Any one who wishes to\r\nunderstand the indications of the clouds, must watch them closely for\r\nmany years, before he can place much reliance upon them. But we shall\r\nagain advert to this point.\r\n\r\nWe have now passed through one sidereal period of the moon. We might\r\ncontinue the record, but it would be tedious. The passages of these\r\nvortices vary in violence at different times, as we might expect; but\r\nthey never cease to circulate, and never will as long as the moon\r\nremains a satellite to the earth; and if we take the passage of any of\r\nthese vortices, and add thereto the time of one sidereal period of the\r\nmoon, we get approximately the time of the next passage. When the\r\nelements of the lunar orbit tend to accelerate the passages, they may\r\ncome in 26 days; and when to retard, in 28 days; and these are about the\r\nlimits of the theory.\r\n\r\nHaving begun and ended this record of the weather with the passage of\r\nthe Inner vortex ascending, it may not be amiss to notice one more, (the\r\nAugust passage,) as it offers a peculiarity not often so distinctly\r\nmarked. We have alluded to the greater force of the storms when the\r\npassage of the vortex corresponds to the passage of the line of low\r\nbarometer or the depression point of a great atmospheric wave, which is\r\nalso due to the action of the ether. In consequence of these waves\r\npassing from west to east, the storm will only be violent when formed a\r\nlittle to the westward. If the storm forms to the eastward, we neither\r\nsee it nor feel it, as it requires time to develop its strength, and\r\nalways in this latitude travels eastward; so that storms may generally\r\nbe said to come from the west, although the exciting cause travels from\r\neast to west. In the case now alluded to, the weather indicated a high\r\nbarometer, and the storm formed immediately to the eastward, even\r\nshowing a distinct circular outline. We subjoin a description.\r\n\r\n_August_ 15th. Clear morning (N.-E.), a bank of cumuli in south: noon\r\nquite cloudy in S. and clear in north. (N.-E.)\r\n\r\n16th. Clear morning (N.-E.); 3 P.M., getting very black in E. and S.-E.,\r\nvery _clear_ to the _westward_; 4 P.M., much thunder and lightning in\r\neast, and evidently raining hard; 5 P.M., a violent squall from _east_\r\nfor 10 minutes; tore up several trees; 6 P.M., the storm passing\r\neastward, clear in west all this time; 6.30 P.M., the storm forming a\r\nregular arch, the vertex being in _S.-E._; the arch of hazy cirrus and\r\nheavy cumulus much lower in S.-E., wind still moderate from east;\r\n10 P.M., clear all around, but lightning in S.-E. and E.\r\n\r\n17th. Fine clear morning (W.); noon, scattered cumuli in north; 6 P.M.,\r\na beautifully regular arch of dense cumuli and cirrus margin in _N.-E._,\r\nwith a constant glimmer of lightning; 7 P.M., very clear to the west,\r\nand north-west, and south; along the northern horizon a line of high\r\npeaked cumuli terminating in N.-N.-W.; a continued roll of distant\r\nthunder in the circular bank in N.-E., and not a moment's cessation to\r\nthe lightning; the electric excitement advancing westward along the\r\nlines of cumuli; the cirrus haze also rising and passing towards S.-W.;\r\n8 P.M., the sky alive with lightning, the cirrus now reaches the zenith;\r\nno streaks of lightning coming to the earth; they seem to radiate from\r\nthe heaviest mass of cumuli, and spread slowly (sufficiently so to\r\nfollow them) in innumerable fibres over the cloudy cirrus portion of the\r\nsky; every flash seems to originate in the same cloud; 8.30 P.M., one\r\nbranching flash covered the whole north-eastern half of the sky, no\r\nleafless tree of the forest could show so many branches; 9.30 P.M., all\r\npassed to S.-W. without rain, leaving behind a large cumulus, as if it\r\nlagged behind. From this cumulus a straight line of lightning shot up\r\n10d above the cloud into a perfectly clear sky, and terminated abruptly\r\nwithout branching.\r\n\r\nWe have been thus particular in giving these details, as this was a\r\nclear case confirming the principles advanced, that the vortices do not\r\nform a continuous line of disturbance, in their daily passage around the\r\nearth. It shows also that the barometer, in connection with these\r\nprinciples, will be a far more useful instrument than it has yet proved\r\nitself, for practical service as an indicator of the weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] For convenience to those wishing to verify the calculation of these\r\ntriangles, we have put down each side and angle as found. Also, as an\r\naid to the navigator.\r\n\r\n[11] Daily Wisconsin, July 7.\r\n\r\n[12] The author.\r\n\r\n[13] Chicago Democrat.\r\n\r\n[14] This was also calculated before the event.\r\n\r\n[15] The letters in a parenthesis signify the direction of the wind.\r\n\r\n[16] Giving this cloud the average velocity of thirty miles per hour,\r\nits altitude was determined by the sextant at twelve miles, and we think\r\nunder-estimated. While measuring, the author's attention was drawn to\r\nthe fact, that although it appeared equally dense above and below, yet\r\nits middle part was the brightest, and as there was only a faint glimmer\r\nof twilight in the N.-W., he concluded that the cloud was self-luminous;\r\nfor when the smallest stars were visible, it glowed about as bright as\r\nthe milky-way in Sagittarius. Occasionally the whole cloud was lit up\r\ninternally by the lightning, and about this time it sent off three rays:\r\none horizontally, westward, which was the faintest; one about N.-W.,\r\ntowards Jupiter, and the brightest of the three; and another towards the\r\nnorth. These were not cirrus streaks, but veritable streams of electric\r\nmatter, and had a very decided rotation from left to right, and\r\ncontinued visible about twenty minutes, as represented above.\r\n\r\n[17] This day the central vortex passed in about latitude 47d N.--the\r\nsouthern margin cannot be nearer than 250 miles, throwing off the 40'\r\nfor the horizontal refraction, would give eight miles of altitude above\r\na tangential plane. Then another seven miles, for curvature, will give\r\nan altitude of fifteen miles for the cumuli. The height of these\r\nthunder-clouds has been much under-estimated. They seem to rise in\r\nunbroken folds to a height of ten and twelve miles frequently; from the\r\ndata afforded by the theory, we believe they will be found much higher\r\nsometimes--even as much as sixteen miles.\r\n\r\n[18] These parallel bands, and bands lying east and west, are frequent\r\nin fine weather between two vortices. Sailors consider them a sign of\r\nsettled weather. After dark there was frequently seen along the northern\r\nhorizon flashes of lightning in a perfectly clear sky. But they were\r\nboth faint and low, not reaching more than 4d or 5d above the horizon.\r\nAfter sunset there were very distinct rays proceeding from the sun, but\r\nthey were shorter than on the evening of the 3d. These are caused by the\r\ntops of the great cumuli of the storm, when sunk below the horizon,\r\nintercepting the sun's rays, which still shine on the upper atmosphere.\r\nThe gradation was very marked, and accorded with the different distances\r\nof the central vortex on the 3d and 4th--although, on the 4th, the\r\nnearest distance must have been over four hundred miles to the southern\r\nboundary of the storm.\r\n\r\n[19] It is worthy of notice here, that New York, which only differs by\r\nabout 40 miles of latitude and 800 in longitude, had the storm earlier,\r\nnear the time of the passage, as appears by the appended account of it.\r\nThis proves, that a storm affects a particular latitude simultaneously,\r\nor approximately so. If this had to travel eastward to reach New York,\r\nit would have been the 10th instead of the 8th. The principal trouble\r\nwas, however, in the early part of the evening of the 8th, to the south\r\nof Ottawa, where the strong wind was drawn in from the northward. If a\r\nvortex passes from north to south, leaving the observer between the\r\npassages, there must, nearly always, be a winding up squall from the\r\nnorth to clear away the vapory atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[20] From the _New York Tribune_, July 9, 1853.\r\n\r\n[21] These pages are now in the compositors' hands, (Nov. 21st,) and up\r\nto the last moment the Author has observed carefully in New York the\r\npassages of these vortices. October 24th, in the inner vortex descending\r\nproduced a violent storm on the coast, and much damage ensued. November\r\n7th, the same vortex ascending was also severe. And on November 13th,\r\nearly, the passage of the central vortex ascending, caused a flood in\r\nConnecticut of a very disastrous nature. Would it not pay the insurance\r\noffices to patronize such investigations in view of such palpable facts\r\nas these?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION THIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIONS TO LUNAR INFLUENCE.\r\n\r\nWe have now presented a theory of the weather, which accounts for many\r\nprominent phenomena, a few of which we shall enumerate. It is an\r\nobserved fact, that in all great storms electrical action is more or\r\nless violent, and that without this element it seems impossible to\r\nexplain the velocity of the wind in the tornado, its limited track, and\r\nthe formation of large masses of ice or hail in the upper regions of the\r\natmosphere. It is also an observed fact, that the barometer is in\r\ncontinued motion, which can only be legitimately referred to a change in\r\nthe weight of the atmospheric column. This we have explained as due to\r\natmospheric waves, caused by the greater velocity of rotation of the\r\nexternal ether, as well as to the action of the three great vortices.\r\nThese causes, however, only partially produce the effect--the greater\r\nportion of the daily oscillations is produced by the action of the great\r\nradial stream of the solar vortex, as we shall presently explain. It is\r\nan observed fact, that, although the storm is frequently violent,\r\naccording to the depression of the barometer, it is not always so.\r\nAccording to the theory, the storm will be violent, _ceteris paribus_,\r\non a line of low barometer, but may still be violent, when the contrary\r\nobtains. Another fact is the disturbance of the magnetic needle during a\r\nstorm. Storms are also preceded generally by a rise in the thermometer,\r\nand succeeded by a fall; also by a fall in the barometer, and succeded\r\nby a rise. It is also well known, that hurricanes are unknown at the\r\nequator, and probably at the poles also. At all events, they are rare in\r\nlat. 80d, and, according to Capt. Scoresby, storms are there frequently\r\nraging to the south, while above, there is clear sky and fine weather,\r\nwith a stiff breeze from the northward. The greater violence of storms\r\nin those regions where the magnetic intensity is greater in the same\r\nlatitude, the probable connection of peculiarities in the electric state\r\nof the atmosphere with earthquakes, and the indications of the latter\r\nafforded by the magnet; the preponderance of westerly winds at a great\r\nelevation in every latitude on the globe visited by man; and the\r\nfrequent superposition of warm layers of air above cold ones at those\r\nelevations, are all facts worthy of note. And the connection of cirrus\r\nclouds with storms, as well as with the aurora, indicates that the\r\nproducing cause is external to the atmosphere, and gradually penetrates\r\nbelow. The theory fully explains this, and is confirmed by the fantastic\r\nwreathings and rapid formation of these clouds in straight lines of a\r\nhundred miles and upwards. But time would fail us in pointing out a\r\ntithe of the phenomena, traceable to the same cause, which keeps our\r\natmosphere in a perpetual state of change, and we shall only advert to\r\none more peculiarity of the theory. It places meteorology on a\r\nmathematical basis, and explains why it is that a storm may be raging at\r\none place, while in another, not very remote, the weather may be fine,\r\nand yet be dependent on the position of the moon.\r\n\r\nThat the moon has exerted an influence on the weather has been the\r\npopular creed from time immemorial; but, ignorant of the mode in which\r\nthis influence was exerted, men have often been found who have fostered\r\nthe popular belief for their own vanity or advantage; and, on the other\r\nhand, philosophers have assailed it more by ridicule than by argument,\r\nas a relic of a barbarian age. Not so with all; for we believe we are\r\nnot wrong in stating, that the celebrated Olbers compared the moon's\r\npositions with the weather for fifty years, before he gave his verdict\r\nagainst it. He found the average amount of rain at the perigee about\r\nequal to the amount at the apogee, as much at the full as at the change,\r\nand no difference at the quadratures. But this fact does not throw a\r\nfeather in the scale by which this theory is weighed. Popular opinions,\r\nof remote origin, have almost always some foundation in fact, and it is\r\nnot much more wise to reject them, than to receive them. The Baron Von\r\nHumboldt--a man possessing that rare ingredient of learning, a practical\r\ncommon sense--observes: \"That arrogant spirit of incredulity which\r\nrejects facts, without attempting to investigate them, is, in some\r\ncases, more injurious than an unquestioning credulity.\"[22] If a popular\r\nbelief or prejudice be absurd, its traditional preservation for a\r\nthousand years or more may very well account for the absurdity.\r\n\r\nThe present system of astronomy still retains the motley garniture of\r\nthe celestial sphere, as handed down from the most remote antiquity; and\r\ngranting that ages of ignorance and superstition have involved the\r\nhistory of the different constellations in a chaos of contradictory\r\ntraditions, there is no doubt at the foundation some seeds of truth\r\nwhich may even yet emerge from the rubbish of fable, and bear fruit most\r\nprecious. That the zodial[23] signs are significant records of something\r\nworthy of being preserved, is prejudice to deny; and we must be allowed\r\nto regard the Gorgons and Hydras of the skies as interesting problems\r\nyet unsolved, as well as to consider that the belief in lunar influence\r\nis a fragment of a true system of natural philosophy which has become\r\nmore and more debased in postdiluvian times. Amongst those who have not\r\nsummarily ignored the influence of the moon, is Toaldo, a Spanish\r\nphysicist, who endeavored to show the connection between the recurrence\r\nof warm and cold seasons, and the semi-revolution of the lunar nodes and\r\napogee, and proposed six of those periods, or about fifty-four years, as\r\nthe cycle in which the changes of the weather would run through their\r\ncourse. According to the present theory, it is not likely such a cycle\r\nwill ever be discovered. There are too many secular, as well as periodic\r\ninfluences combining, to produce the effect; and the times are too\r\nincommensurable. Lately, Mr. Glaisher has presented a paper to the Royal\r\nSociety, giving about fourteen years from observation. Others have\r\nlately attempted to connect the changes of the seasons with the solar\r\nspots, as well as with the variations of the magnetism of the earth, but\r\nwithout any marked result.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be urged, that if the sidereal period of the moon be\r\napproximately a cycle of change, it would have been detected long ago.\r\nOne reason why this has been so long concealed, is the high latitude of\r\nthe observers. Spain, Italy, and Turkey, are better situated than other\r\nEuropean countries; but the scientific nations lie further north; and\r\nfrom these the law has gone forth to regulate more southern lands. In\r\nthe United States, particularly in the great plains of the west, the\r\nweather can be better compared; not only on account of the latitude\r\nbeing more favorable, but also on account of the greater magnetic\r\nintensity of the western hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIt must also be remembered that there are in latitude 40d, five or six\r\ndistinct passages of the disturbing cause in one sidereal period of the\r\nmoon. If two of these periods are drawn closer together by the change of\r\nthe elements, the interval between two others must necessarily be\r\nincreased. Besides, the effect produced is not always the same, for\r\nreasons already adverted to. One vortex may be more violent one month,\r\nor for a few days in one month, while another may be more active the\r\nnext. It may also happen that for several successive passages, the\r\npassage shall be central in one latitude, while two or three degrees\r\nnorth or south, another place shall be passed by. In different months\r\nand in different years, as well as in different seasons of the year, the\r\nenergy of the ether may be augmented or diminished. But it may be said,\r\nthat, supposing the theory true, if its indications are so uncertain, it\r\nis of little value. By no means. It is true there are many things to be\r\ninquired into; but it is a great thing in this science to be able to\r\ntake the first step in the right direction,--to find even the _key_ of\r\nthe portal. It is a great stride to be able to say, a storm may happen\r\nat such a time, but cannot happen at another; that a storm, when raging,\r\nwill go in this direction, rather than in that; that it will be central\r\nhere, and less violent yonder; and when we consider its bearing on\r\nastronomical and other science, it is difficult to exaggerate its value\r\nto the world at large.\r\n\r\nAgain, it may be said that rain, and cloudy days, and fresh breezes, and\r\neven strong winds, sometimes occur, when the vortices do not pass\r\ncentrally. This is true; yet only indicating that where the vortices are\r\ncentral, an unusual disturbance is taking place. But there is another\r\ncause, which was purposely omitted in considering the prominent features\r\nof the theory, in order not to encumber the question with secondary\r\ninfluences. By referring to Fig. 3, section 1, we see that the lateral\r\nvortices of the globe are continually passing off to the southward, in\r\nthe northern hemisphere, in a succession of dimples, and continually\r\nreforming. We will now represent this mode of action in profile, as it\r\nactually occurs in the illustration we have used.\r\n\r\nThe vortex passing off from O, (Fig. 20,) although it does not actually\r\nreach the surface of the atmosphere, affects the equilibrium of the\r\nether, and, for a short distance from the parent vortex, may cause an\r\nascensional movement of the air. If to this is conjoined a northerly\r\nwind from the vortex, a band of clouds will be produced, and perhaps\r\nrain; but violent storms never occur in the intervals, except as a\r\nsteady gale, caused by the violence of a distant storm. Thus, it will\r\nfrequently be noticed that these vortices are flanked by bands of\r\nclouds, which pass southward, although the individual clouds may be\r\nmoving eastward. Hence, instead of disproving the theory, they offer\r\nstrong evidence of its truth; and could we view the earth from the moon\r\nwith a telescope, we should no doubt see her beautifully belted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20]\r\n\r\nBut it may be again asked, why should not the weather be the same\r\ngenerally, in the same latitude, if this theory be true? If the earth\r\nwere a globe of level land, or altogether of water, no doubt it would be\r\nsimilar; but it must be remembered, that both land and water are very\r\nunequally distributed: that the land is of varying extent and\r\nelevation--here a vast plain, far removed from the ocean, and there a\r\nmountain chain, interposing a barrier to the free course of the\r\natmospheric currents; sometimes penetrating in full width into the\r\nfrigid zone, and again dwindling to a few miles under the equator. One\r\nvery important distinction is also to be remarked, in the superficial\r\narea of the different zones, reckoning from the equator, and taking the\r\nhemisphere as 100 parts:\r\n\r\n  Frigid    zone   8 parts.\r\n  Temperate  \"    52   \"\r\n  Torrid     \"    40   \"\r\n\r\nFor as the time of rotation in every latitude is the same, the area to\r\nbe disturbed in the same time, is less in high latitudes, and there a\r\ngreater similarity will obtain, _ceteris paribus_. In lower latitudes,\r\nwhere both land and water stretch away for thousands of miles, it is not\r\nwonderful that great differences should exist in the electrical and\r\nhygrometric state of the air.\r\n\r\nThe summer of many countries is always dry--California for instance. In\r\nwinter, in the same country, the rains are apparently incessant. This of\r\ncourse depends on the power of the sun, in diverting the great annual\r\ncurrents of the atmosphere. As long as the dry north-west trade sets\r\ndown the coast of California, the circumstances are not favorable for\r\ngiving full development to the action of the vortices. When the trade\r\nwind ceases, and the prevailing winds come from the south, loaded with\r\nvapor, the vortices produce storms of any magnitude; but (and we speak\r\nfrom two years' observation) the passages of the vortices are as\r\ndistinctly marked there in winter time, as they are in the eastern\r\nStates; and in summer time, also, they are very perceptible. The same\r\nremark applies to Mediterranean countries, particularly to Syria and\r\nAsia Minor; although the author's opportunity for observing lasted only\r\nfrom April to December, during one season. If we are told it never rains\r\non the coast of Peru, or in Upper Egypt, it does not seriously militate\r\nagainst the theory. The cause is local, and the Samiel and the sand\r\nstorm of the desert, is but another phase of the question, explicable on\r\nthe same general principles. From the preceding remarks it will be seen,\r\nthat in order to foretell the character of particular days, a previous\r\nknowledge of the weather at that particular place, and for some\r\nconsiderable time, is requisite; and hence the difficulty of laying down\r\ngeneral rules, until the theory is more fully understood.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODIFYING CAUSES.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the causes which are auxiliary and interfering. It is\r\nnatural that we should regard the sun as the first and most influential\r\nof these causes, as being the source of that variation in the\r\ntemperature of the globe, which alternately clothes the colder regions\r\nin snow and verdure. The heat of the sun undoubtedly causes the ether of\r\nthe lower atmosphere to ascend, not by diminution of its specific\r\ngravity; for it has no ponderosity; but precisely by increase of\r\ntension, due to increase of motion. This aids the ascensional movement\r\nof the air, and therefore, when a vortex is in conjunction with the sun,\r\nits action is increased--the greatest effect being produced when the\r\nvortex comes to the meridian a little before the sun. This has a\r\ntendency to make the period of action to appear dependent on the phases\r\nof the moon, which being the most palpable of all the moon's variations,\r\nhas been naturally regarded by mankind as the true _cause_ of the\r\nchanges of the weather. Thus Virgil in his Georgics, speaking of the\r\nmoon's influence and its signs:\r\n\r\n   \"Sin ortu in quarto (Namque is certissimus auctor)\r\n    Pura, nec obtusis per coelum cornibus ibit;\r\n    Totus et ille dies, et qui nascentur ab illo,\r\n    Exactum ad mensem, pluvia ventisque carebunt.\"\r\n\r\nHence, also, in the present day we hear sailors speak of the full and\r\nchange, or the quartering of the moon, in connection with a gale at sea;\r\nthus showing, at least, their faith in the influence of the phenomenon.\r\nYet it is actually the case, at certain times, that in about latitude\r\n40d and 41d, the storms appear about a week apart.\r\n\r\nThere is some reason, also, to suspect, that there is a difference of\r\ntemperature on opposite sides of the sun. As the synodical rotation is\r\nnearly identical with the siderent period of the moon, this would\r\nrequire about forty-four years to run its course, so as to bring the\r\nphenomena to exact coincidence again. Since these observations were\r\nmade, it is understood that Sig. Secchi has determined that the\r\nequatorial regions of the sun are hotter than his polar regions. It may\r\nbe owing to this fact, that we have inferred a necessity for a change,\r\nwhose period is a multiple of the sun's synodical rotation, but it is\r\nworthy of examination by those who possess the necessary conveniences.\r\n\r\nAnother period which must influence the character of different years,\r\ndepends on the conjunction of the perigee of the lunar orbit with the\r\nnode. Taking the mean direct motion of the moon's perigee, and the mean\r\nretrograde motion of the node, we find that it takes six years and one\r\nday nearly from conjunction to conjunction. Now, from the principles\r\nlaid down, it follows, that when the perigee of the orbit is due north,\r\nand the ascending node in Aries, that the vortices of the earth will\r\nattain their greatest north latitude; and when these conditions are\r\nreversed, the vortices will reach their highest limit in the lowest\r\nlatitude. This will materially affect the temperature of the polar\r\nregions. In the following table, we have calculated the times of the\r\nconjunctions of the apogee and pole of the orbit, taking the mean\r\nmotions. It may be convenient to refer to by-and-bye, remembering that\r\nwhen the conjunction takes place due south, the vortices reach the\r\nhighest, but when due north, the vortices in the northern hemisphere\r\nhave their lowest upper limit:\r\n\r\n  CONJUNCTION OF APOGEE AND POLE OF ORBIT.[24]\r\n\r\n  Year.

Let us explain:\r\n\r\nThe moon's inertia forces the earth from the mechanical centre of the\r\nterral system, but is never able to force her clear from the central\r\naxis. With the sun it is different. He possesses many satellites\r\n(planets). Jupiter alone, from his great mass and distance, is able to\r\ndisplace the whole body of the sun. If other planets conspire at the\r\nsame side, the centre of the sun may be displaced a million of miles\r\nfrom the mechanical centre of the solar system. Considering this centre,\r\ntherefore, as the centre of an imaginary sun, from which heliocentric\r\nlongitudes are reckoned, the longitude of the real sun will vary with\r\nthe positions of the great planets of the system. Now, although this\r\n_systematic_ longitude will not be exactly similar to the heliocentric\r\nlongitude reckoned from the sun's centre, yet, for the purposes\r\nintended, it will correspond sufficiently, and we shall speak of the\r\nlongitude of the sun as if we reckoned heliocentric longitudes from the\r\nmechanical centre of the system. When we come to consider the solar\r\nspots, we shall enter into this more fully. In the following diagram we\r\nshall be able to perceive a cause for variation of seasons in a given\r\nyear, as well as for the general character of that year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21]\r\n\r\nLet S represent the centre of the sun, and the circle a vertical section\r\nof the sun, cutting; through the centre,--SJ being in the equatorial\r\nplane of the vortex, of which ZZ' represents the axis. As the ether\r\ndescends the poles or axis at Z, it is met by the current down the\r\nopposite pole, and is thence deflected in radii along the equatorial\r\nplane to J. But on the side S, the ether is opposed by the body of the\r\nsun; its direction is consequently changed, and cross currents are\r\nproduced, assuming it as a principle, that the ethereal fluid is\r\npermeable by other currents of similar matter, and that it tends always\r\nto move in right lines. This granted, it is evident that, in passing the\r\nsun, the quick moving ether forms a conical shell, (the sun being at the\r\napex,) so that the strongest current of ether is in this conical shell,\r\nor at the surface of this conical space. As the plane of the ecliptic is\r\nnot much inclined to the sun's equator, and this last probably not much\r\ninclined to the plane of the vortex, should the earth have the same\r\n_heliocentric_ longitude at the time, (or nearly the same,) she would\r\nbe in an eddy, as respects the radial stream, and be protected from its\r\nfull force by the body of the sun.\r\n\r\nNow, the ether comes down the axis with the temperature of space, and\r\nmay possibly derive a _little_ additional temperature in passing over\r\nthe body of the sun; so that in this position the earth is protected\r\nfrom the chilling influence of the radial stream, by being protected by\r\nthe body of the sun. And although, from the immense velocity of the\r\nether, it cannot derive much additional temperature, there may still be\r\nan appreciable difference, due to this cause.\r\n\r\nIt is the chilling influence of the ethereal stream which originated the\r\nidea among philosophers, of _frigorific impressions, darted from a clear\r\nsky_. In some years the sun will be nearly in the centre of the system;\r\nin other years the axis of the vortex will not come near the sun. And as\r\nthe sun's longitude may vary through the entire circle, it may happen\r\nthat the earth's longitude shall coincide in winter or summer, or spring\r\nor autumn. When, however, the earth emerges from the protection of the\r\nsun, and enters the conical shell, considered as a space of considerable\r\ndepth, she will again be exposed to the full force of the radial stream,\r\nrendered more active by the previous deflection, and by the numerous\r\ncross currents pervading it; so that a mild and calm winter may be\r\nsucceeded by a cold and stormy spring. The present season, (1853) the\r\nearth's longitude coincided with the sun's longitude in about 135d, and\r\nconsequently was in the conical space spoken of, during February and\r\nMarch; but the radius vector of the sun's centre, being then less\r\nthan 300,000 miles, the protection was not as complete as it is\r\nsometimes. Still, the general fineness of these months was remarkable;\r\nyet in April and May, when the earth became again exposed to the action\r\nof the solar stream, the effect was to retard the spring, and disappoint\r\nthe prognostications of the weather-wise. In applying these principles,\r\nwe must consider the effect in those latitudes which are more readily\r\naffected,--that is, in the temperate zone, midway between the two\r\nextreme zones of heat and cold.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 and 1838, the longitude of the sun's centre corresponded with\r\nthe earth's, in August and September, when there was neither rain nor\r\nelectrical excitement; and consequently those seasons were sickly over\r\nthe whole country. Now, there is another cause which renders the months\r\nof August, September, and October, deficient in electrical energy, and\r\nconsequently more prone to be sickly. If, therefore, the two causes\r\nunite their influence, the autumnal months will be more sickly at those\r\ntimes. This last cause, however, only affects the _northern latitudes_\r\nin autumn, and consequently, _ceteris paribus_, the autumnal months\r\nshould not be so proverbially sickly in the southern hemisphere. This\r\nis, however, only suggestive.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1843, the winter was very mild in January and February; but in\r\nMarch it turned cold and stormy, and continued through April. In this\r\nyear the longitude of the sun was nearly the same as in 1853,--the two\r\nlongitudes of the earth and sun corresponding about the last of January;\r\nbut in March, the earth forsook the comparative calm produced by the\r\nsun's position, and hence the greater cold.[25]\r\n\r\nThus it appears at every step we take, that the different members of the\r\nsolar system do indeed belong to the same family, whose least motions\r\nhave their influence on the rest. Who could have anticipated that the\r\nposition of Jupiter in his orbit had anything to do with the health of\r\nthis remote planet, or with the mildness of its seasons? In this we have\r\na clue to the origin of that astrological jargon about planetary aspects\r\nbeing propitious or malign. Philosophers are even yet too prone to wrap\r\nthemselves in their mantle of academic lore, and despise the knowledge\r\nof the ancients, while there is reason to believe that the world once\r\npossessed a true insight into the structure of the solar system. As war\r\nbecame the occupation of mankind, under the despotic rule of ambition,\r\nso truth retired, and ignorance seizing upon her treasures, has so\r\nmutilated and defaced them, that their original beauty no longer\r\nappears. Let us hope that the dawn of a better day is approaching.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another cause (just alluded to) which modifies the action\r\nof the vortices.\r\n\r\nWe have shown that, if the periodic times of the planets are\r\napproximately equal to the periodic times of the contiguous parts of the\r\nsolar vortex, the density of the ether is directly as the square roots\r\nof the distances from the centre. As the earth is at her perihelion\r\nabout the first of January, the density of the surrounding ether is then\r\nless than in other parts of the orbit; consequently, if we suppose that\r\nthere is a continual tendency to equilibrium, the ether of space must\r\npress inwards, during the time between the perihelion and aphelion,\r\n(_i.e._ from January to July,) lowering the temperature and increasing\r\nthe electrical action of those months. As the distance from the sun is\r\nmost rapidly augmenting about the first of April, and the effective\r\npower of the sun's radiation is most rapidly increasing in May; by\r\ncombining the two we shall find, that about the first of May we shall\r\nhave considerable electrical action, and cold weather. This explains\r\nalso, in part, the prevalent tradition of certain days in May being very\r\ncold.[26] When the earth leaves the aphelion, a reaction takes place,\r\nbeing most rapid in September. There is then an _escape_ of ether from\r\nthe earth, which keeps up the temperature, and causes these months to be\r\nsickly, from the negative electrical state of the atmosphere. In the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, the effects in the same season will be reversed,\r\nwhich may partly account for the greater degree of cold in that\r\nhemisphere, and for accelerating the approach of both summer and winter,\r\nwhile in the north they were both retarded.\r\n\r\nWe must now advert to another cause, which of all others is probably the\r\nmost important, at least to the other members of the solar system.\r\n\r\nIn every part of the solar vortex the ether is continually pressing\r\noutwards. We are not now speaking of the radial stream, but of the\r\nslower spiral motion of the ether around the axis of the vortex, whose\r\ncentrifugal force is bearing the whole body of the ether outwards, thus\r\nrarefying the central parts, and thus giving rise to the polar influx,\r\nfrom which arises the radial stream. This may be made more intelligible,\r\nby reflecting that the polar current is comparatively dense ether, and\r\nthat the length of the axis of the vortex prevents this influx current\r\ncoming in sufficient quantities to restore an equilibrium in the density\r\nof the medium. Yet, what does come down the poles, is distributed\r\nrapidly along the equatorial plane, leaving the space still rarefied.\r\nNow we perceive, that in order for the radial stream to continue in\r\naction, requires the whole medium of the vortex to be also moving\r\noutward; it is therefore continually condensed as it proceeds. This\r\ncondensation necessarily converts much of the specific heat of the ether\r\ninto sensible heat; so that the _temperature_ of the medium is\r\ncontinually increasing, as the distance from the sun increases.\r\n\r\nWhen we contemplate the solar system as the emanation of one Great Mind,\r\nwe naturally seek for evidence of the wisdom of a supreme intelligence\r\nin _all_ the arrangements of that system. But, however humbly and\r\nreverently we may speak of these arrangements, we can scarcely avoid the\r\nwish, that the planetary distances had been differently arranged, if\r\nNewton's doctrine be true, that space is a vacuum, and that the heat of\r\na planet, is inversely as the squares of the distances from the sun.\r\nFor, to speak of the temperature of space, except as dependent on this\r\nlaw, is one of those many incomprehensible inconsistencies with which\r\nphilosophers are chargeable. If the Newtonian philosophy is literally\r\ntrue, space has _no temperature_, and the surface heat of the planet\r\nNeptune is nearly 1,000 times less than on our own globe. Again, on\r\nMercury it is seven times greater, which heat would scorch and consume\r\nevery organic substance on the earth, and speedily envelope the boiling\r\nocean in a shroud of impermeable vapor. Granting even that space may not\r\nbe a vacuum, and yet the law of gravitation be true, we may still be\r\nallowed to consider both Saturn and Uranus and Neptune, as inhospitable\r\nabodes for intelligent creatures; and, seeing the immensity of room in\r\nthe system, there is no reason why these planets might not have been\r\npermitted to revolve nearer the great source of light and life and\r\ncheering emanations. To suggest the resources of Omnipotence is no\r\nargument. He has surrounded us with analogies which are seen, by which\r\nwe may attain a knowledge of those which are not seen; and we have every\r\nreason to suppose that the great Author of nature is not indifferent to\r\nthe aspects under which his works reveal him unto his creatures. Yet\r\nthere is (on the above hypothesis) an apparent want of harmony in the\r\nplanetary distances; and if frail mortality may be permitted to speak\r\nout, an explanation is needed to obviate this seeming anomaly in the\r\neconomy of the world. The more we learn of the physical arrangements of\r\nthe universe, the more do they correspond with our experience of the\r\nnice adaptation of the means to the end which obtains in our own globe,\r\nand we can only judge of other planets by the analogies around us. Here,\r\nthere, are extremes of temperature it is true: it is necessary there\r\nshould be, and we can see and understand the necessity in all such\r\ncases, and how they conduce to the general average of good. But,\r\nastronomers can give no reason why it is necessary that some planets of\r\nour system should be placed so remote that the sun is frittered down to\r\na star, whose heatless light is but a mockery to those frigid realms.\r\n\r\nNow, according to this theory, the temperature of Neptune may be far\r\nmore uniform and conducive to life than that of our own globe. The\r\nchilling influence of the solar stream at that planet being nearly null,\r\nand the temperature of the surrounding space far greater. So also\r\nMercury, instead of being the burning planet of the schools, may suffer\r\nthe most from cold.\r\n\r\nThe planet Mars is generally considered, of all the members of the\r\nsystem, most nearly to resemble our own world. The telescope not only\r\nreveals seas and continents, but the snowy circles round his poles,\r\nwhich appear to increase and diminish, as his winter is beginning or\r\nending. This planet's ecliptic is similar to our own in inclination or\r\nobliquity, his distance, also, is far greater, and his winter longer;\r\nyet, for all this, his snow zones are less than on our own globe. This\r\nanomalous fact has, we believe, never been noticed before; but it is\r\nexplicable on the theory, and therefore confirms it. Mars has no\r\nsatellite, and therefore his centre will be coincident with the centre\r\nof the marsial vortex. There will be no _lateral vortices_ to derange\r\nhis atmosphere, and if the axis of his vortex coincides also with the\r\naxis of the planet, the central vortex will be continually over the\r\npoles, _and there will be no storms on the planet Mars_. A capital fact\r\nconnected with this, is the want of belts, as in Jupiter and Saturn; for\r\nthese planets have satellites, and if _they_ are not massive enough, the\r\nbelts may be produced by an obliquity in the axis of the Jovial and\r\nSaturnial vortices. If Mars had an aurora like the earth, it is fair to\r\npresume the telescope would ere this have shown it. He is, therefore, in\r\nequilibrium. In applying this reasoning to the earth, we perceive that a\r\ncertain influence is due to the difference of temperature of the\r\nethereal medium surrounding the earth, at perihelion and aphelion, being\r\nleast at the former, and greatest at the latter.\r\n\r\nAs a modifying and interfering cause in the action of the vortices, we\r\nmust mention the great natural currents of the atmosphere, due to the\r\nearth's rotation.\r\n\r\nIt is considered that the sun is the principal cause of these great\r\ncurrents. By elevating the surface atmosphere of the equator, a lateral\r\ncurrent is induced from the north and south; but on account of the\r\nenlarging circles of latitude, their direction tends more from the\r\nnorth-east and south-east. These currents are usually called the trades.\r\nWithout disputing the correctness of this, it may be doubted whether the\r\nwhole effect is due to the sun. As this principle affects the ocean\r\nlikewise, it is necessary to look into it; and in order to simplify the\r\nquestion, we will first suppose our globe covered entirely by the ocean,\r\nwithout any protuberant land.\r\n\r\nLet us assign a uniform depth of ten miles to this ocean. In the Fig.\r\nfollowing, the two circles will represent the surface and bottom of the\r\nocean respectively. The axis of rotation is thus represented by the line\r\nPP'. Let us consider two particles of water at m and n, as feeling the\r\ninfluence of this rotation; they will, of course, be both urged towards\r\nthe equator by the axifugal force. Now, every particle in the ocean\r\nbeing also urged by the same force, it might be supposed that after a\r\nprotuberant mass of water had accumulated at the equator EE', the whole\r\nocean would be in equilibrium. This would not follow. The particle at m\r\nis urged by a greater force than n; consequently the particle at n is\r\noverborne by the pressure at m. Considering both in the same direction,\r\nyet the particle at n must give way, and move in the opposite direction.\r\nJust as the heaviest scale of the balance bears up the lightest,\r\nalthough both gravitate towards the same point. This is so self-evident\r\nthat it would seem unnecessary to dwell upon it, had not the scientific\r\nworld decided that the rotation of the earth can cause no currents\r\neither in the atmosphere or in the ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22]\r\n\r\nThe axifugal forces of the two particles m and n are directly as the\r\nlines Mm and Nn, and if the gravitating forces were also as the radii Tm\r\nand Tn, no motion would be produced. Admitting even the Newtonian law to\r\nbe rigidly exact, the earth cannot be considered a homogeneous globe,\r\nbut, on the contrary, the density of the central parts must be nearly\r\nthirty times greater than the density of the surface of the ocean. The\r\nratio of the gravitating forces of these two particles is, therefore,\r\nless than the ratio of their respective radii, and the axifugal tendency\r\nof the particle at n is more than proportionally restrained by the\r\ncentral gravitation; and hence m will move towards the equator, and n\r\ntowards the poles, as represented in the Fig.\r\n\r\nIt is on account of the overwhelming momentum of the surface waters of\r\nthe South Pacific over the North, that the Pacific, at Panama, stands\r\nsix or seven feet higher than the Atlantic. We shall again allude to\r\nthis interesting fact.\r\n\r\nAccording to newspaper reports of a lecture, delivered in New York, by\r\nLieut. Maury, U. S. N., this gentleman endeavors to explain the currents\r\nof the ocean, by referring them to evaporation in the tropics. The vapor\r\nleaves the salt of the water behind, and thus, by continual\r\naccumulation, the specific gravity of the tropical waters is greater\r\nthan that of the superficial waters nearer the poles; the lighter\r\nwater, therefore, passes towards the equator, and the heavier water\r\nbelow, towards the poles. If this be a correct statement of that\r\ngentleman's theory, fidelity to our standards compels us to question the\r\nsoundness of the conclusion. The mere fact of the surface water of the\r\nocean being lighter than that of the bottom, cannot on any known\r\nprinciples of science cause any movement of the surface waters towards\r\nthe equator. When such an acute and practical physicist is driven, by\r\nthe palpability of the fact that the polar waters are continually\r\ntending towards the equator, to seek the cause in the tropical\r\nevaporation, it shows that the dogma, which teaches that rotation can\r\nproduce no motion, is unsound.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel, in speaking of the solar spots, says: \"We may also\r\nobserve that the tranquillity of the sun's polar, as compared with his\r\nequatorial regions (if his spots be really atmospheric), cannot be\r\naccounted for by its rotation on its axis only, but must arise from some\r\ncause external to the sun, as we see the belts of Jupiter and Saturn and\r\nour trade winds arise from a cause external to these planets combining\r\nitself with their rotations, which _alone_ (and he lays an emphasis on\r\nthe word) can produce no motions when once the form of equilibrium is\r\nattained.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to the origin of the solar spots, we have no disposition to\r\nquestion the conclusion; but, as regards the _principle_ laid down, that\r\nrotation can produce no motions when once the form of equilibrium is\r\nattained, we must unequivocally dispute it. If our atmosphere were of\r\nuniform density, the rotation of the earth would cause no current such\r\nas we have described; with our atmosphere as it is, the result will be\r\ndifferent. The momenta of two portions of matter are the products of\r\ntheir inertiae by their motions, and, in the present case, we must take\r\nthe inertiae of equal spaces. A cubic inch of air at the surface, and at\r\nthree miles above the surface, is as 2 to 1; but their centrifugal\r\nvelocity varies only as the radii of the respective spheres, or as 1320\r\nto 1321. In the polar regions, therefore, the momentum of the surface\r\nair preponderates, and, in this case, the _surface_ current is towards\r\nthe equator, and the upper current towards the poles. When, however, the\r\ncentrifugal velocity is considerably increased in a lower latitude, and\r\nthe curvature of the surface becomes more and more inclined to the\r\ndirection of that resolved part of the centrifugal force, which is\r\nalways _from_ the axis, the surface layers will evince a tendency to\r\nleave the surface, and an intermingling will then take place in the\r\nspace between latitude 70d and 50d, or in latitude 60d. As this layer is\r\ncontinually urged on in the same direction by the surface layer of\r\nlatitudes above 60d, the upper layer now becomes a current setting\r\n_towards_ the equator, and, consequently, the back current occupies the\r\nsurface. Now, considering that the rarefying action of the sun is\r\nelevating the air under the equator, there must necessarily be an upper\r\ncurrent from the equator to the poles; so that if we conceive the two\r\ncurrents to meet about latitude 30d, there will be a second\r\nintermingling, and the current from the poles will again occupy the\r\nsurface. Thus, we regard a part of the effect of the trades to the\r\nrotation of the earth, which is the chief impelling power at the poles,\r\nas the sun is at the equator; and the latitudes 60d and 30d will be\r\nmarked by some especial phenomena of temperature, and other\r\nmeteorological features which do actually obtain. These would be much\r\nmore marked if the irregular configuration of land and sea, the\r\nexistence of mountain chains, and the different heating power of\r\ndifferent latitudes, owing to the unequal distribution of the land, did\r\nnot interfere; and the currents of the air (disregarding the deflection\r\neast and west) might then be represented by a treble link or loop, whose\r\nnodes would vary but little from latitudes 30d and 60d. As it is, it\r\nhas, no doubt, its influence, although unimportant, when compared with\r\nthe disturbing action of the ethereal vortices.\r\n\r\nThere is another phenomenon due to the action of the radial stream,\r\nwhich has given much trouble to the physicist, and which has yet never\r\nbeen explained. This is the horary oscillations of the atmospheric\r\npressure which, in some countries are so regular that the time of day\r\nmay be ascertained by the height of the barometer. According to\r\nHumboldt, the regularity of the ebb and flow in the torrid regions of\r\nAmerica, is undisturbed by storms or earthquake. It is supposed that the\r\nmaxima occur at 9 A.M. and 10 1/2 P.M., and the minima at 4 A.M. and\r\n4 1/4 P.M. From the morning minimum to the morning maximum is,\r\ntherefore, five hours; from the evening minimum to the evening maximum\r\nis 6 1/4 hours; from the evening maximum to the morning minimum is 5 1/2\r\nhours, and from the morning maximum to the evening minimum is 7 1/4\r\nhours. Again, these oscillations are greatest at the equator, and\r\ndiminish with the increase of latitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23]\r\n\r\nIf we suppose the earth's axis perpendicular to the plane of the vortex,\r\nand P the pole in the above figure, and SP the line joining the centre\r\nof the earth and sun, M and m will represent the points in the earth's\r\nequator where it is midday and midnight respectively. The solar stream\r\npenetrates the terral vortex; and strikes the earth's atmosphere along\r\nthe lines parallel to SP. The direct effect would be to pile up the\r\natmosphere at N and n; and therefore, were the earth at rest, the\r\nmaximum would be at 6 A.M. and 6 P.M., and the minimum at midday and\r\nmidnight; but the earth rotating from N towards M, carries along the\r\naccumulated atmosphere, being more sluggish in its motions than the\r\nproducing cause, which cause is still exercised to force it back to N.\r\nFrom this cause the maximum is now found at K. For a like reason the\r\nminimum at M would be found at L, but on account of the motion of the\r\nearth being now in the same direction as the solar stream, the minimum\r\nis found still more in advance at k; so that, according to the theory,\r\nthe interval between the morning maximum and the evening maximum, should\r\nbe greater than the interval between the evening maximum and the morning\r\nmaximum; and so it is, the first being 13 1/2 hours and the last 10 1/2\r\nhours. The morning minimum should also be less marked than the evening\r\nminimum, and this also is a fact. The effect also should be greater in\r\nthe tropics than in high latitudes, which again also obtains; being 1.32\r\nFrench lines at the equator, and only 0.18 at latitude 70d. Had the\r\nearth no obliquity, the effect would be as the squares of the cosines of\r\nthe latitude; but the ratio is diminished by the inclination of the\r\naxis. But there are other variations of the barometer of longer period,\r\napparently depending on the phases of the moon, but which cannot be\r\nreconciled to the attracting power of the moon as an atmospheric tide;\r\nand Arago concluded that they were due to some _special cause_, of which\r\nthe nature and mode of action are unknown. Perhaps this theory will\r\nobviate the difficulty, as although the central vortex comes to the\r\nmeridian at the same time as the moon, its effect will be different on\r\nthe inferior meridian to what it is on the superior one; whereas the\r\nmoon's attraction should be the same on both. That the passage of a\r\nvortex over or near a particular place should affect the barometer, is\r\ntoo obvious to need explanation, and therefore we may say that the\r\ntheory will explain all those varieties both small and great, which have\r\ncaused so much speculation for the last fifty years.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.\r\n\r\nIn applying the theory to the magnetism of the earth, we must bear in\r\nmind that the earth is probably magnetic by induction, and not in virtue\r\nof its own specific action. The rotation of the surrounding ether, and\r\nthe consequent production of a radial stream, calls the ether into\r\nmotion within the earth's interior, as well as on the surface; but it\r\ndoes not follow that the ether shall also enter the earth at its poles\r\nand escape at its equator, for the obliquity of the vortex would\r\ninterfere with this result. It is sufficient that this does occur in the\r\nterral vortex immediately surrounding the earth. From late experiments\r\nit is pretty well established that the axial direction of the needle,\r\n(and of other bodies also,) is due to peculiar internal arrangement in\r\nlaminae or layers, the existence of which is favorable to the passage of\r\nthe magnetic current.\r\n\r\nAccording to the experiments[27] of Dr. Tyndal, it is found that the\r\nmagnetism of a body is strongest along the line of greatest density. As,\r\ntherefore, the laminae of bodies may be considered planes of pressure,\r\nwhen these planes are suspended horizontally, the directive force is\r\ngreatest, and the longest diameter of the body sets axial. On the other\r\nhand, when the body was suspended so that the laminae were vertical, the\r\nlongest diameter set equatorial. Now, we know that the crust of the\r\nearth is composed of laminae, just as the piece of shale in Doctor\r\nTyndal's experiments, and that these layers are disposed horizontally.\r\nAnd whatever force originally arranged the land and water on our globe,\r\nit is evident that the continents are longest from north to south, and\r\ntherefore correspond to the natural direction of the magnetic force.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the intrinsic difficulties of this question, and the\r\nmystery yet attaching to it, we may be permitted to enter a little more\r\nminutely into it, and jointly consider other questions of interest, that\r\nwill enable us to refer the principal phenomena of terrestrial magnetism\r\nto our theory.\r\n\r\nWe have before adverted to the discrepancies in the earth's compression,\r\nas determined by the pendulum, and also to the uncertainty of the moon's\r\nmass, as deduced from the nutation of the earth's axis. It is also\r\nsuspected that the southern hemisphere is more compressed than the\r\nnorthern; and other phenomena also point out the inadequacy of the law\r\nof gravitation, to account for the figure of the earth.\r\n\r\nFrom the invariability of the axis of rotation, we must conclude that\r\nwhatever form is the true form, it is one of equilibrium. In casting our\r\neyes over the map of the world, we perceive that the surface is very\r\nunequally divided into land and sea; and that the land is very unequally\r\narranged, both north and south, and east and west. If we compare the\r\nnorthern and southern hemisphere, we find the land to the water about 3\r\nto 1. If we take the Pacific portion, and consider the north end of New\r\nZealand as a centre, we can describe a great circle taking in one half\r\nthe globe, which shall not include one-tenth of the whole land. Yet the\r\naverage height of the remaining nine-tenths, above the level of the sea,\r\nis nearly 1,000 feet. Call this nine-tenths nearly equal to one-fourth\r\nof the whole surface, and the protuberant land in the hemisphere,\r\nopposite the South Pacific, amounts to 1/30,000 part of the whole mass\r\nof the earth, or about 1/700 of the mass of the moon. Again, the mean\r\ndensity of the earth is about 5 1/2--water being unity,--and the mean\r\ndensity of the surface land is only about half this: but three-fourths\r\nof the whole surface is water. Hence, we see that the materials of the\r\ninterior of the earth must be either metallic or very compressible. To\r\nassign a metallic nucleus to the earth, is repugnant to analogy; and it\r\nis not rendered even probable by facts, as we find volcanic emissions to\r\ncontain no heavier elements than the sedimentary layers. Besides, there\r\nare indications of a gradual increase of density downwards, such as\r\nwould arise from the compressibility of the layers. Seeing, therefore,\r\nthe equilibrium of the whole mass, and the consequent hydrostatic\r\nbalance of the land in the sea,--seeing also the small compressibility\r\nof the solid portions, and the great compressibility of the fluid, the\r\ninference is legitimate that the whole is hydrostatically balanced, and\r\nthat our globe is a globe of water, with an intermediate shell of land,\r\nspecifically lighter than the fluid in which it is suspended. Where this\r\nshell is of great thickness, it penetrates to greater depths, and\r\nattains to greater elevations above the surface of the aqueous globe;\r\nwhere it is less thick, it is found below the surface, and forms the\r\nbottom of the upper ocean. Recent soundings give much greater depths to\r\nsome parts of the ocean, than the most elevated land upon the globe.\r\nCaptain Denham, of H. B. M. ship Herald, lately sounded in 37d south and\r\n37d west, and found bottom at 7,706 fathoms, or about nine English\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nAs the interior portions of our globe are totally unknown, and the\r\ncompressibility of water is well established, it is just as sane to\r\nconsider water the most abundant element of nature, as solid land. The\r\ngreat question to ask is, whether there may not be other phenomena\r\nincompatible with this supposition? It is plain that the permanency of\r\nterrestrial latitudes and longitudes would be unaffected by the\r\nconditions we have supposed. Would the precession of the equinoxes be\r\nalso unaffected? Mr. Hopkins has entered into such an investigation, and\r\nconcludes: \"Upon the whole, then, we may venture to assert that the\r\nminimum thickness of the crust of the globe, which can be deemed\r\nconsistent with the observed amount of precession, cannot be less than\r\none-fourth or one-fifth of the radius of the earth.\" These\r\ninvestigations were made on the hypothesis of the interior fluidity\r\nbeing caused by the fusion of the central portions of a solid globe; but\r\nit is evident that the analytical result would be the same if these\r\ncentral parts were water, inclosed by an irregularly-spherical shell of\r\nland. Nor would the result be affected, if we considered certain\r\nportions of the interior of this solid shell to be in a state of fusion,\r\nas no doubt is the case.\r\n\r\nMay not the uncertainty of the mass of the moon, be owing to the fact\r\nthat this shell is not so rigidly compacted but that it may yield a\r\nlittle to external force, and thus also account for the tides in the\r\nPacific groups, rather obeying the centrifugal force due to the orbit\r\nvelocity of the earth, than the attraction of the moon?\r\n\r\nSince the days of Hipparchus the sidereal day has not diminished by the\r\nhundredth part of a second; and, consequently, seeing that the\r\ncontraction of the mass must be limited by the time of rotation, it is\r\ninferred that the earth has not lost 1/508th of one degree of heat since\r\nthat time. This conclusion, sound as it is, is scarcely credible, when\r\nwe reflect on the constant radiation into a space 60d below zero. Admit\r\nthat the globe is a globe of water, whose average temperature is the\r\ntemperature it receives from the sun, and the difficulty vanishes at\r\nonce. Its diameter will be invariable, and the only effect of the\r\ncooling of the solid parts will be to immerse them deeper in the water,\r\nto change the _relative_ level of the sea without changing its volume.\r\nThis is no puerile argument when rightly considered; but there is\r\nanother phenomenon which, if fairly weighed, will also conduct us to the\r\nsame views.\r\n\r\nIt is now a fact uncontroverted, that the sea does actually change its\r\nlevel, or rather, that the elevation of continents is not only apparent\r\nbut real. The whole coast of Sweden and Finland is rising at the present\r\nday at the rate of four feet in a century, while on the south a contrary\r\neffect is produced. Various hypotheses have been formed concerning this\r\ninteresting fact. Yet from the indications of geology, it must have been\r\nan universal phenomenon in the early ages of the world, in order to\r\naccount for the emersion of sedimentary deposits from the fluid which\r\ndeposited them. May not internal fires be yet spreading, and the\r\ncontinents expanding instead of contracting? And may there not be an\r\ninequality in this process, so as necessarily to immerse in one\r\ndirection nearly as much as to elevate in another? One fact is certain,\r\nthe elements are scattering the materials of the land along its Oceanic\r\ncoasts, which of itself must produce a very minute effect in disturbing\r\nthe hydrostatic balance; but a more efficient agent is the earthquake\r\nand volcano.\r\n\r\nThe upheaving of tracts of land by earthquakes, as on the coast of Chili\r\nwould thus be satisfactorily explained, by attributing a certain\r\nresistance due to cohesion or friction preventing a _gradual_ change of\r\nlevel, but producing it suddenly by the jar of the earthquakes. May we\r\nnot inquire also, whether the facility with which the earth seems moved\r\nby this destructive agent, does not point to the same solution as the\r\nirregularity of the figure of the earth?\r\n\r\nThis is a subject on which it is allowable to speculate, especially if\r\nany light can be thereby thrown on the still more mysterious source of\r\nterrestrial magnetism. It is for such a purpose that we have permitted\r\nourselves to digress from that subject. In this connection we also may\r\nacknowledge our indebtedness to the sacred volume for the first germ of\r\nthis theory of the weather.\r\n\r\nBelieving in the authenticity of the Mosaic history of the deluge, the\r\nauthor found it difficult to refer that event to other than natural\r\ncauses, called into action by the operation of other causes, and all\r\nsimultaneous with the going forth of the fiat of Omnipotence. Thus\r\nreasoning, he was led to regard the deluge as a physical phenomenon\r\ninviting solution, and as a promising exponent to the climatology of\r\nthe early world. He looked upon the bow of promise, as the autograph of\r\nthe Creator, the signature to a solemn bond, upon which the eye of man\r\nhad never before rested. But if there was no rainbow before the deluge,\r\nthere was no rain; and following up this clue, he was not only enabled\r\nto solve the problem, but also led to the true cause, which produces the\r\nprincipal commotions in our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nScience boasts of being the handmaid of religion; yet there are names of\r\nnote in her ranks who have labored rather to invest this phenomenon with\r\nthe mantle of fable, and to force it into collision with the records\r\ngraven on the rocky pages of geognosy. But the world is ever prone to be\r\ncaptivated by the brilliancy of misapplied talents, instead of weighing\r\nmerit by its zeal in reconciling the teachings of those things which are\r\nseen, with those which are revealed.\r\n\r\nIf our globe be constituted as we suppose, the land might experience\r\nrepeated submersions, without involving the necessity of any great\r\ndeparture from established laws. And we might refer to the historical\r\nrecord of one of these, with all the minute particulars as positive\r\ndata, imposing on us the necessity of admitting that the solid parts of\r\nthe globe are hydrostatically balanced in the sea. But, modern science\r\nis not always correctly defined when called the pursuit of truth, nor\r\nhuman learning the means of discovering it.\r\n\r\nIf we could divest ourselves of this prejudice, we should have a ready\r\nsolution of the difficulty presented by the earth having two north\r\nmagnetic poles, and probably two also in the south. For, by regarding\r\nthe old and new continents as two distinct masses of land whose bases\r\nare separated by 6,000 miles of water, we recognize two great magnets,\r\ndependent, however, for their magnetism, on the rotation of the terral\r\nvortex.\r\n\r\nThis is no place to enter into a lengthy discussion of such a difficult\r\nsubject as magnetism, but we may be allowed to enter a protest against\r\nthe current theory of electro-magnetism, viz.: that a force is generated\r\nby a galvanic current at right angles to the producing cause, which is\r\ncontrary to the fundamental principles of mechanics. We may conceive\r\nthat a current is induced from or to the surrounding space by the\r\nrarefaction or condensation attending the transmission of such a current\r\nalong a wire, and that rotation should follow, just as a bent pipe full\r\nof small holes at the lower end, and immersed in water as a syphon, will\r\ngenerate a vorticose motion in the water; but mere juxtaposition,\r\nwithout participation and communication with the general current, is\r\nirrational, and, therefore, not true.\r\n\r\nWe have always regarded a magnetic needle as a part of the great natural\r\nmagnet, the earth; that its north pole actually points to the north, and\r\nits south pole to the south; and, being free to move, it is affected by\r\nthe circular motion of the surrounding ether, and by every motion by\r\nwhich the ether is directed. If there was any attraction between the\r\nearth and the needle, opposite poles would be presented, but it is not\r\nso--the force is merely directive.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETIC VARIATIONS.\r\n\r\nLet us now see whether we cannot assign an adequate cause for the\r\nsecular and periodic variations in the inclination and declination of\r\nthe needle. These have been generally referred to changes of\r\ntemperature, as in fact, also, the magnetism of the earth is sometimes\r\nascribed to galvanic or electric currents, called forth by a daily\r\nchange of temperature. Our theory gives a totally different explanation\r\nof these variations.\r\n\r\nIn the northern hemisphere, the north point of the needle moves from\r\neast to west in the morning from about 8 1/2 A.M. to 1 1/2 P.M., and\r\nreturns to its mean position about 10 P.M. It then passes over to the\r\neast, and again returns to its mean position about 8 or 9 A.M. The\r\nanalogy of this motion, with the horary changes in the barometer,\r\nindicate a common origin. Humboldt, in the instructions he drew up for\r\nthe Antarctic Expedition under Sir James Ross, says: \"The phenomena\r\nof periodical variations depend manifestly on the action of _solar\r\nheat_, operating probably through the medium of thermo electric currents\r\ninduced on the earth's surface. Beyond this rude guess, however,\r\n_nothing is yet known of their physical cause_. It is even still a\r\nmatter of speculation whether the solar influence be a principal or only\r\na subordinate cause.\" That the sun may exert a modifying influence on\r\nthe phenomenon is not unlikely, but that he cannot be the principal\r\ncause, is evident from the following considerations. These horary\r\nvariations of the magnetic needle are as great at the bottom of deep\r\nmines far removed from solar influence, as on the surface. They are as\r\ngreat, _ceteris paribus_ on a small island in the midst of the ocean, as\r\nin the interior of continents, where the heating power of the surface is\r\nvastly greater. They are extremely regular, so that between the tropics,\r\naccording to the sagacious Humboldt, \"the time of the day may be known\r\nby the direction of the needle, as well as by the height of the\r\nbarometer.\"\r\n\r\nBut what is the cause of these variations? This question is the most\r\ndifficult of all physical problems, and we shall only aim at indicating\r\nthe causes which are yet perhaps too intricately involved to afford a\r\npositive numerical determination. Admitting the existence of two\r\nprincipal solid masses whose general direction is from south to north,\r\nand that these masses are more susceptible of permeation by the ethereal\r\nfluid than the waters in which they are suspended, we have a general\r\nsolution of the position of the magnetic poles, and of the isogonic,\r\nisoclinic, and isodynamic lines. Considering, too, that the southern\r\npoles of these masses are the points of ingress, and the northern poles\r\nthe points of egress, it is easily understood that the ethereal medium\r\nhaving the temperature of space, will cause the southern hemisphere to\r\nbe colder than the northern, and also that the magnetic poles will be\r\nthe poles of maximum cold, and the centres respected by the isothermal\r\nand isogeothermal lines.\r\n\r\nThe general direction of the magnetism of the earth may be considered as\r\nthe controlling influence, therefore, in determining the position of the\r\nmagnetic needle; but there are other causes which, to some extent, will\r\nmodify the result. That half of the globe turned away from the sun will\r\npartake of the density of the ether at that distance, which is greater\r\nthan on the side next the sun; the magnetic intensity ought, therefore,\r\nto be greater in the night than in the day. The poles of the great\r\nterrestrial magnets, or even the position of a magnetic needle on the\r\nsurface, are continually placed by the earth's rotation in a different\r\nrelation to the axes of the terral vortex, and the tangential current,\r\nwhich is continually circulating around the globe, has its inclination\r\nto a given meridian in a perpetual state of change. If we conceive that\r\nthere is a tendency to force the needle at right angles to this current,\r\nwe shall have an influence which varies during the day, during the year,\r\nand during the time occupied by a complete revolution of the node. The\r\nprincipal effect, however, of the horary variation of the needle is due\r\nto the radial stream of the sun, which not only penetrates the\r\natmosphere, but also the solid crust of the earth. Its principal\r\ninfluence is, however, an indirect influence, as we shall endeavor to\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\nNo fact in the science of electro-magnetism is, perhaps, better\r\nestablished than the disposition of an ethereal current to place itself\r\nat right angles to the magnetic meridian, and conversely, when the\r\ncurrent is not free to move, to place the needle at right angles to the\r\ncurrent. Now, the terrestrial magnet or magnets, may be considered to be\r\nsurrounded by a body of ether in rotation, which, in the earth, on its\r\nsurface, and for some distance from the surface, is made to conform to\r\nthe general rule, that is, to circulate at right angles to the magnetic\r\nmeridian. Outside this again, the ether more and more conforms to the\r\nposition of the axis of the vortex, and this position varying, it must\r\nexert _some_ influence on the surface currents, and, therefore, change\r\nin some degree the position of the magnetic meridian. The radial stream\r\ncomes from the sun in parallel lines, and strikes the globe and its\r\nsuperficial ethereal envelope just as we have shown its action on the\r\natmosphere; but in this last case the magnetic equator is not a great\r\ncircle, neither can we suppose its effects to be an accumulation of a\r\nfluid which is imponderable at points 90d from the plane passing through\r\nthe centre of the earth and sun, and coincident with the plane of the\r\ncentral meridian, and a depressing effect on that meridian. Its precise\r\ninfluence must be, from the nature of the cause, to deflect the circular\r\ncurrent towards the poles, in places less than 90d from the meridian,\r\nand a contrary effect must be produced in places greater than 90d from\r\nthe meridian. Let us assume, for argument's sake, that the magnetic\r\npoles of the earth correspond to the poles of rotation, the parallels of\r\nlatitude will, therefore, represent the ethereal currents circulating\r\naround the globe. Now, at sunrise, the radial stream of the solar vortex\r\nis tangential to the surface, and, therefore, can produce no change in\r\nthese currents. As the sun ascends say about 8 or 9 A.M., the radial\r\nstream striking only the surface of the earth perpendicularly in that\r\nplace where the sun is vertical (which we will suppose at the equator),\r\nstreams off on every side, as the meridians do from the pole, and the\r\ncircles of latitude (that is the ethereal currents) being parallel to\r\nthe equator, they are met by the radial stream obliquely, and deflected\r\ntowards either pole. By this deflection they are no longer at right\r\nangles to the meridians. But, from the principle of reaction above\r\nnoticed, the magnetic meridians will place themselves at right angles to\r\nthe current, or, in other words, the magnetic pole will change its\r\nposition on the surface of the earth with respect to that particular\r\nplace. But, in other parts of the world, the meridians are in opposite\r\nphases at the same instant of absolute time; therefore, the magnetic\r\npoles are not points, but wide areas enclosing the magnetic poles of all\r\nthe countries under the sun. As this conforms to observation, it is\r\nworthy our especial attention, and may be understood by the subjoined\r\nfigure, in which the oblique curves represent the course of the\r\ntangential current in the different positions of the sun, the parallel\r\nlines representing the solar radial stream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24]\r\n\r\nAs the sun gains altitude the action of the radial stream is at a\r\ngreater and greater angle to the circular currents, and attains its\r\nmaximum at noon, still acting, however, after noon; but seeing that the\r\ncircular current possesses a force of re-action, that is, that the\r\nmagnetism of the earth is ever striving to bring these currents to their\r\nnatural direction, an hour or two after noon, the currents tend again to\r\nthe equator, and the maximum deflection is passed, and finally ceases a\r\nfew hours after sunset. Now let us attend to what is going on on the\r\nopposite side of the world. The radial stream passing over the polar\r\nregions, now produces a contrary effect; the ethereal atmosphere of the\r\ngreat magnet is accumulated on the farthest side from the sun, by the\r\naction of the radial stream passing over the polar region, the parallel\r\ncurrents are now bent towards the equator, being at a maximum in places\r\nwhere it is an hour or two past midnight. Before they were concave to\r\nthe equator, and now they are convex; the magnetic meridian is therefore\r\ndeflected the contrary way to what it was in the day time, by the same\r\nprinciple of reaction. After the maximum, say at 4 A.M., the deflection\r\ngradually ceases, and the magnetic meridian returns to its mean position\r\nat 8 or 9 A.M. These times, however, of maximum and minimum, must vary\r\nwith the time of the year, or with the declination of the sun, with the\r\nposition of the moon in her orbit, with the perigee of the orbit, and\r\nwith the place of the ascending node; there are also minor influences\r\nwhich have an effect, which present instrumental means cannot render\r\nappreciable.\r\n\r\nWhat says observation? The needle declines from its mean position in the\r\nwhole northern hemisphere to the westward, from about 8.30 A.M., until\r\n1.30 P.M.; it then gradually returns to its mean position by 10 A.M.\r\nAfter 10 P.M., it passes over to the eastward, and attains its maximum\r\ndeflection about three or four hours after midnight, and is found again\r\nat its mean position about 9 A.M. Now, this is precisely the direction\r\nof the deviation of the magnetic meridian, the needle therefore only\r\nfollows the meridian, or still continues to point to the temporary\r\nmagnetic pole. And although we have assumed, for the sake of simplicity,\r\nthat the mean magnetic pole corresponds to the pole of rotation; in\r\ntruth there are two magnetic poles, neither of which correspond; yet\r\nstill the general effect will be the same, although the numerical\r\nverification will be rendered more difficult.\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere the effect is the reverse, (this southern\r\nhemisphere, however, must be considered separated from the northern by\r\nthe magnetic equator, and not by the geographical one,) the needle\r\ndeclines to the eastward in the morning, and goes through the same\r\nchanges, substituting east for west, and west for east. Does observation\r\ndecide this to be to be a fact also? Most decidedly it does; and this\r\nalone may be considered a positive demonstration, that the theory which\r\nexplains it is true. The contrary deflection of the needle in the\r\nnorthern and southern hemisphere may be formally proclaimed as utterly\r\nbeyond the reach of the common theory of magnetism to explain. This\r\ndifficulty arises from considering the needle as the disturbed body\r\ninstead of the earth; and also from the fact that the effect of solar\r\nheat must be common to needles in both hemispheres, and act upon similar\r\npoles, and consequently the deflection must be in the same direction.\r\n\r\nBut a still more capital feature is presented by the discovery of\r\nColonel Sabine, that the deflection is in contrary directions at the\r\nCape of Good Hope, at the epoch of the two equinoxes. This arises from\r\nthe great angle made by the magnetic meridian at this place, with the\r\nterrestrial meridian--the variation being by Barlow's tables, 30d to the\r\nwestward. The sun varies in declination 47d throughout the year. At the\r\nsouthern solstice, therefore the radial stream strikes the circular\r\ncurrent on the southern side, and deflects it towards the equator,\r\nrendering the declination to the westward in the morning; but at the\r\nnorthern solstice the radial stream strikes the current on its northern\r\nside, and the deflection is eastward in the morning. And the vicinity of\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope is, perhaps, the only part of the world where this\r\nanomaly will obtain; as it is necessary not only that the declination\r\nshall be considerable, but also that the latitude shall not be very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nObservation also determines that the amount of the horary variation\r\nincreases with the latitude. Near the equator, according to Humboldt, it\r\nscarcely amounts to three or four minutes, whilst it is from thirteen to\r\nfourteen minutes in the middle of Europe. The theory explains this also;\r\nfor as the circles recede from the equator, the angles made by their\r\nplanes with the direction of the radial stream increases, and hence the\r\nforce of deflection is greater, and the effect is proportioned to the\r\ncause. We have also a satisfactory explanation of the fact that there\r\nhas not yet been discovered a line of _no variation of horary\r\ndeclination_ as we might reasonably anticipate from the fact that the\r\ndeclinations are in _contrary directions_ in the northern and southern\r\nhemisphere. This is owing to the ever-varying declination of the sun.\r\nThere would be such a line, no doubt, if the axis of the earth were\r\nperpendicular to the plane of the orbit, and the magnetic pole coincided\r\nwith the pole of rotation: for then the equator would be such a line.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETIC STORMS.\r\n\r\nBut there are also irregular fluctuations in the direction of the\r\nmagnetic needle. These depend on the moon, and are caused by the passage\r\nof the vortices over or near to the place of observation. The action of\r\nthese vortices is proved to be of variable force, whether arising from\r\natmospheric conditions, or due to an increased activity of the ethereal\r\nmedium throughout the whole system, is at present immaterial. They do\r\nvary, and sometimes the passage of a vortex will deflect the needle a\r\nwhole degree. At other times, there are magnetic storms extending over a\r\ngreat part of the earth's surface; but there is reason to suppose, that\r\nthe extent of these storms has been over estimated. Thus, on the 25th of\r\nSeptember, 1841, a magnetic storm was observed in Toronto, and at the\r\nsame time there was one felt at the Cape of Good Hope. There is no great\r\nmystery in this. If we suppose the axis of the central vortex, for\r\ninstance, to have passed Toronto in latitude 43d 33' north, in ordinary\r\npositions of the moon, in her orbit, the southern portion of the axis\r\nwould be in 33d or 34d south latitude, and consequently would have\r\npassed near the Cape of Good Hope on the same night. Now, we certainly\r\ncould not expect the northern portion of the vortex to be intensely\r\nactive, without the southern portion being in the same state of\r\nactivity. That this is the true explanation is proved by magnetic storms\r\nin the same hemisphere being comparatively limited in extent; as,\r\naccording to Gauss and Weber, magnetic storms which were simultaneously\r\nfelt from Sicily to Upsala, did not extend from Upsala to Alten. Still\r\nit would not be wonderful if they were felt over a vast area of\r\nthousands of miles as a consequence of _great_ disturbance in the\r\nelasticity of the ether in the terral vortex; as the solid earth must be\r\npermeable to all its motions, and thus be explicable on the general\r\nprinciples we have advanced.\r\n\r\nBut besides these variations which we have mentioned, there are changes\r\nsteadily going on, by which the isodynamic, isogonic and isoclinic lines\r\nare permanently displaced on the surface of our planet. These must be\r\nattributed to changes of temperature in the interior of the globe, and\r\nto the direction in the progress of subterranean fires, which it may\r\nalso be expected will change the isogeothermal lines. But there are\r\nchanges, which although of long period, are yet periodic, one of which\r\nis obviously due to the revolution of the lunar nodes in eighteen and a\r\nhalf years, and the revolution of the apogee in nine years. The first is\r\ncontinually changing the obliquity of the axis of the vortex, and they\r\nboth tend to limit the vortices in their extreme latitudes; but the\r\nplanet Jupiter has an indirect influence, which is probably equal, if\r\nnot greater, than the action of the moon, in changing the magnetic\r\ndeclination.\r\n\r\nFrom the investigations of Lamont, it would appear, that the period of\r\nthe variations of magnetic declination is about 10 1/3 years, while,\r\nmore recently, R. Wolfe has suggested the connection between this\r\nvariation and the solar spots, and assigns a period of 11.11 years, and\r\nremarks, that it \"corresponds more exactly with the variations in\r\nmagnetic declination than the period of 10 1/3 years established by\r\nLamont. The magnetic variations accompany the solar spots, not only in\r\ntheir regular changes, but even in their minor irregularities: this\r\nlatter fact is itself sufficient to prove definitely the important\r\nrelations between them.\"[28]\r\n\r\nAs the planet Jupiter exerts the greatest influence on the sun, in\r\nforcing the centre from the mechanical centre of the system, the\r\nlongitude of the sun will in a great measure depend on the position of\r\nthis planet; and, in consequence, the sun will generally revolve around\r\nthis centre in a period nearly equal to the period of Jupiter. The\r\nsidereal period of Jupiter is about twelve years, but the action of the\r\nother planets tend to shorten this period (at least, that has been the\r\neffect for the last twenty or thirty years), and bring it nearly to the\r\nperiod assigned by M. Wolfe to the variations in the magnetic\r\ndeclinations. As this has its influence on the radial stream, and the\r\nradial stream on the declination, we see at once the connection between\r\nthem. When we come to a consideration of the solar spots, we shall\r\nexhibit this influence more fully.\r\n\r\n\r\nAURORA BOREALIS.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine another phenomenon. The Aurora Borealis has been\r\ngenerally considered to be in some way connected with the magnetism of\r\nthe earth, and with the position of the magnetic pole. It is certain\r\nthat the appearance of this meteor does affect the needle in a way not\r\nto be mistaken, and (although not invariably) the vertex of the luminous\r\narch will usually conform to the magnetic meridian. Yet (and this is\r\nworthy of attention), the observations made in the North Polar\r\nExpeditions[29] \"appear to prove, that in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nmagnetic pole the development of light is not in the least degree more\r\nintense or frequent than at some distance from it.\" In fact, as the\r\nAmerican magnetic pole is, as stated, in latitude 73d, the central\r\nvortex will seldom reach so high, and, consequently, the aurora ought\r\nat such times to be more frequent in a lower latitude. In a late work by\r\nM. de la Rive, this gentleman expresses the opinion, that the cause of\r\nthe aurora is not due to a radiation of polar magnetism, but to a purely\r\nelectrical action.[30] His explanation, however, is not so satisfactory\r\nas his opinion. Now, we have examined numerous cases of auroral\r\ndisplays, and never yet found one which could not be legitimately\r\nreferred to the action of ethereal vortices. Generally, the aurora will\r\nnot be visible, when the upper surface of the atmosphere of that\r\nlatitude in which the vortex is known to be (reckoning in the direction\r\nof the magnetic meridian) is below the horizon, which shows that the\r\nbrightest portion is in the atmosphere. In latitude 41d even, it may\r\nshow itself when the vortex is three days north, more frequently when\r\none or two days north; but when the vortex passes centrally, or south,\r\nit rarely is seen, and this is the only difficulty in explaining it by\r\nthe theory. But, when we reflect that the ether shoots out in straight\r\nlines, and at an angle corresponding to the magnetic dip, we are at no\r\nloss to perceive the reason of this. If each minute line composing the\r\nlight were seen endwise, it would be invisible; if there were millions\r\nsuch in the same position, they could add nothing to the general effect;\r\nbut, when viewed sideways, the case would be different, there would be a\r\ncontinued reduplication of ray upon ray, until in the range of some\r\nhundreds of miles an effect might be produced amounting to any degree of\r\nintensity on record. Now, this is the case when the aurora is\r\nimmediately overhead, it will be invisible to those below, but may be\r\nseen by persons a hundred miles south; so, also, when it is to the\r\nsouth, it is too oblique to the line of vision to be seen, especially as\r\nall the rays to the northward of the observer can contribute nothing to\r\nincrease the effect. That it is of the nature of rays very much\r\ndiffused, can hardly be doubted; and, therefore, if only of a few miles\r\nin depth, its impressions are too faint to be sensible. By referring to\r\nthe record of the weather in the second section of this work, an auroral\r\ndisplay will be found on July 12th, the central vortex having passed a\r\nlittle to the northward the same evening, and the next day passing south\r\n_descending_. On that occasion the author saw an inclined column, in\r\nprofile, due east, and between himself and a line of bluffs and timber,\r\nabout eight miles distant; And, he has not any doubt that the mass of\r\nrays began where he stood. As in a shower, every drop, passing through a\r\nconical surface, whose axis passes through the sun and through the eye,\r\ncontributes to form the apparently distant rainbow.\r\n\r\nThe altitude of this meteor has been much exaggerated, especially of\r\nthose rings or luminous arches, which are often detached completely from\r\nthe luminous bank. On the 24th of May, a bright aurora was visible at\r\nOttawa, but the author's attention was engrossed by the most brilliant\r\narch of light he had ever seen. It was all the time south of the zenith,\r\nand had no visible connection with the aurora north. At 9 hours, 59\r\nminutes, 30 seconds mean solar time, Arcturus was in the exact centre of\r\nthe band, at which time it was very bright, and full 7d wide. At the\r\nsame time, Prof. G.W. Wheeler observed the aurora in Perryville, in the\r\nState of Missouri, only 1d of longitude to the westward, but did not see\r\nthe arch.[31] The difference of latitude between the two places being 3d\r\n30', and the weather, as he states, clear and still, there is only one\r\nreason why he did not see the arch: it must have been too _low_, and had\r\nbecome merged in the bank of light. At the time mentioned, the altitude\r\nof Arcturus was 68d 30', and, as Prof. Wheeler assigns only 10d as the\r\naltitude of the bank, the maximum elevation of the arch, on the\r\nsupposition of its composing a part of the bank, was 43 miles. At\r\nPerryville, the bank and streamers had disappeared at 10 o'clock. At\r\nOttawa, the arch or bow disappeared at 10 h. 5 m., differing only the\r\nfraction of a minute from the time at Perryville; but, the bank was\r\nstill visible, but low and faint, the greatest altitude having been over\r\n30d. To show the rapid fluctuations in width and position of this bow,\r\nwe will add a few of the minutes taken at the time with great care, in\r\nhopes some other observer had been equally precise. When first seen,\r\nthere were three luminous patches, or elongated clouds of light; one in\r\nLeo, one in Bootes, and another in Ophinchus, all in line. This was\r\nabout 9h. 15m. The times following are correct to 30 seconds:\r\n\r\n   9h. 42m. 30s. Bow complete; south edge 2d north of Arcturus.\r\n\r\n   9   45   30   Northern edge diffuse south; edge bright, and well\r\n                 defined; 10d wide in zenith; north edge on Alphacca.\r\n\r\n   9   47   30   South edge 5d north of Arcturus; north edge close to\r\n                 Cor. Caroli.\r\n\r\n   9   53   30   Eastern half composed of four detached bands\r\n                 _shingling_ over each other.\r\n\r\n       58   30   Arcturus on south; bow narrower.\r\n\r\n   9   59   30   Arcturus in the middle of the band; very bright and\r\n                 regular in outline, and widest at the zenith.\r\n\r\n  10    0   30   Arcturus on northern edge; north side better defined\r\n                 than the southern.\r\n\r\n  10    2    0   Arcturus 1d north; very bright.\r\n\r\n  10    2   30   Gamma and Delta Leonis, northern edge.\r\n\r\n  10    3        Regulus on southern age; getting faint.\r\n\r\n  10    5        Fast fading away.\r\n\r\n  10    5   30   Scarcely visible; bank in north faint.\r\n\r\nThis aurora was due to the _inner vortex ascending_, whose period was at\r\nthis time 28 days.\r\n\r\nThere are several circumstances to be observed in this case. The bow\r\nbrightened and faded simultaneously with the aurora, and respected the\r\nvertex of the auroral bank, being apparently concentric with it. The\r\nbow, therefore, depends on the same cause, but differs from the aurora\r\nin being limited to the _surface_ of the atmosphere in which the vortex\r\nhas produced a wave to the southward of its central path, as may be\r\nunderstood by inspecting Fig. 2, Sec. 1,--the figure representing the\r\npolar current of the central vortex. On the 29th of May, 1840,[32] the\r\nauthor saw a similar phenomenon, at the same time of night, and passing\r\nover the same stars southward until it reached within 5d of Jupiter and\r\nSaturn, to which it was parallel. This atmospheric wave offers a greater\r\nresistance to the passage of the ether: hence the light. On this account\r\nit is, also, that when the passage of a vortex is attended by an auroral\r\ndisplay there will be no thunder-storm. There may be an increase of\r\nwind; but the atmosphere at such times is too dry to make a violent\r\nstorm, and there is a silent restoration of the equilibrium, by the\r\nether passing through the dry atmosphere, without meeting any\r\ncondensable vapor, and becoming luminous on account of the greater\r\nresistance of the air when unmixed with vapor. We thus see also the\r\nconnection between the aurora and the linear cirri, and we have a\r\ntriumphant explanation of the fact, that when the observer is north of\r\nthe northern limit of the vortices, he sees the aurora to the south and\r\nnot to the north; for, to see it to the northward, he would have to see\r\nit in the same latitude as it appears in the south, and, consequently,\r\nhave to see across twice the complement of the latitude. We thus see,\r\nalso, why the temperature falls after an aurora; for, the passage of\r\nelectricity in any shape, must have this effect on account of the great\r\nspecific caloric of this fluid. We see, also, why the aurora should be\r\nmore frequent where the magnetic intensity is greatest and be\r\nconsequently invisible at the equator, and why the magnetic needle is so\r\nsensibly affected at the time of its occurrence. We may, perhaps, here\r\nbe allowed to allude to another phenomenon connected with terrestrial\r\nmagnetism and electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\nThe awful and destructive concussions which sometimes are produced at\r\ngreat depths beneath the surface of the soil, would seem to indicate\r\nthat no force but that of electricity is adequate to account for the\r\nalmost instantaneous desolation of wide tracts of the earth's surface.\r\nBut we do not mean to say that the action of the terral vortices,\r\ncombined with the internal conditions of our planet, is the only cause;\r\nalthough it is far from improbable that the same activity of the ether,\r\nwhich generates through these vortices, the full fury of the hurricane\r\nin the tropics, may be simultaneously accompanied by a _subterranean_\r\nstorm. And physicists are too rash to reject the evidence on which the\r\nconnection of the phenomena rests.\r\n\r\nIn the extract given by Colonel Reid, in his \"Law of Storms,\" from Sir\r\nGeorge Rodney's official report of the great hurricane of 1780, it is\r\nstated, that, \"Nothing but an earthquake could have occasioned the\r\n_foundations_ of the strongest buildings to be rent; and I am convinced\r\nthat the violence of the wind must have prevented the inhabitants from\r\nfeeling the earthquake which certainly attended the storm.\"[33] Again,\r\nin the Savannah-la-Mar hurricane, which occurred the same year and\r\nmonth, the Annual Register, published at Jamaica, states, that at the\r\nsame time, \"a smart shock of an earthquake was felt.\" The general\r\nserenity of equatorial regions is due to the fact that they are beyond\r\nthe limit of the vortices, as in Peru, where neither rain nor lightning\r\nnor storm is ever seen. Thunder and rain, without storms, however, are\r\ncommon in other tropical countries, also out of the reach of the\r\nvortices. But even in those parts, (as the Antilles,) lying in the track\r\nof these vortices, the weather is not as _frequently_ disturbed as in\r\nhigher latitudes. The storms of the Antilles, when they do occur,\r\nhowever, are fearful beyond any conception, showing the presence of some\r\ncause, auxiliary to the ordinary disturbing action of the vortices,\r\nwhich, when simultaneously occurring, adds tremendously to their force.\r\n\r\nThat earthquakes are preceded _sometimes_ by a peculiar haziness and\r\noppressiveness, similar to that which sometimes precedes a storm, is a\r\ncurrent opinion in volcanic countries. And Humboldt, who doubts the\r\nconnection, has to confess that sudden changes of weather have\r\n_succeeded_ violent earthquakes, and that \"during the great earthquake\r\nof Cumana, he found the inclination of the needle was diminished 48'.\"\r\nHe also mentions the simultaneous occurrence of shocks, from\r\nearthquakes, and a clap of thunder, and the agitation of the\r\nelectrometer during the earthquake, which lasted from the 2d of April to\r\nthe 17th of May, 1808; but concluding that \"these indications presented\r\nby clouds, by modifications of atmospheric electricity, or by calms,\r\ncannot be regarded as _generally_ or _necessarily_ connected with\r\nearthquakes, since in Peru, Canada, and Italy, earthquakes are observed,\r\nalong with the purest and clearest skies, and with the freshest land and\r\nsea breezes. But if no meteorological phenomena indicates the coming\r\nearthquake, either on the morning of the shock or a few days previously,\r\nthe influence of certain periods of the year, (the vernal and autumnal\r\nequinoxes,) the commencement of the rainy season in the tropics, after\r\nlong drought, cannot be overlooked, even though the genetic connection\r\nof meteorological processes, with those going on in the interior of our\r\nglobe, is still enveloped in obscurity.\"[34]\r\n\r\nIt is at the equinoxes that the earth changes her distances from the sun\r\nmost rapidly, and whether she is passing from her perihelion or from\r\nher aphelion, the density of the ether externally is changing in the\r\nsubduplicate ratio of these distances and consequently at these times\r\nthere will be the greatest disturbance of the electric equilibrium. How\r\nfar our views of the internal structure of our globe, (considered along\r\na diameter as a solid crust, then a fused mass separated from the lower\r\nocean by another solid crust, and separated from a similar arrangement\r\non the opposite side by an interposed mass of water, perhaps also\r\npossessing a solid nucleus,) may affect this question, is difficult to\r\nsay; but that the agent is electric, appears highly probable; and very\r\nrecently it has been discovered, by M. Ratio Menton, that a piece of\r\niron, suspended by attraction to a magnet, will fall on the approach of\r\nan earthquake; thus indicating that the power of the magnet is\r\ntemporarily weakened by the action of some disturbing force.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] Hum.

The solar spots have long troubled astronomers, and to this\r\nday no satisfactory solution of the question has been proposed; but we\r\nshall not examine theories. It is sufficient that we can explain them on\r\nthe same general principles that we have applied to terrestrial\r\nphenomena. There can be but little doubt about the existence of a solar\r\natmosphere, and, reasoning from analogy, the constituent elements of the\r\nsun must partake of the nature of other planetary matter. That there are\r\nbodies in our system possessing the same elements as our earth, is\r\nproved by the composition of meteoric masses, which, whether they are\r\nindependent bodies of the system, or fragments of an exploded planet, or\r\nprojected from lunar volcanoes, is of little consequence; they show that\r\nthe same elements are distributed to other bodies of the system,\r\nalthough not necessarily in the same proportions. The gaseous matter of\r\nthe sun's atmosphere may, therefore, be safely considered as vapors\r\ncondensable by cold, and the formation of vortices over the surface of\r\nthis atmosphere, brings down the ether, and causes it to intermingle\r\nwith this atmosphere. But, from the immensely rapid motion of the polar\r\ncurrent of the solar vortex, this ether may be considered to enter the\r\natmosphere of the sun with the temperature of space.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel, in commenting on the theory of Mr. Redfield before\r\nthe British Association, convened at Newcastle in 1838,[35] suggested an\r\nanalogy to terrestrial hurricanes, from a suspected rotation and\r\nprogressive motion in these spots. From their rapid formation, change of\r\nshape, and diameter, this view is allowable, and, taken in conjunction\r\nwith the action of the ethereal currents, will account for all the\r\nphenomena. The nucleus of the spot is dense, like the nucleus of a storm\r\non the earth, and surrounded by a penumbon precisely as our storms are\r\nfringed with lighter clouds, permitting the light of the sun to\r\npenetrate. And, it has been observed, that these spots seem to follow\r\none another in lines on the same parallel of solar latitude (or nearly\r\nthe same), exactly as we have determined the action of the vortices on\r\nthe surface of the earth from observation. These spots are never found\r\nin very high latitudes--not much above 30d from the solar equator. If we\r\nconsider this equator to be but slightly inclined to the plane of the\r\nvortex, this latitude would be the general position of the lateral solar\r\nvortices, and, in fact, be confined principally to a belt on each side\r\nof the equator, between 15d and 30d of solar latitude, rather than at\r\nthe equator itself. This, it is needless to say, is actually the case.\r\nBut, a more capital feature still has been more recently brought to\r\nlight by observation, although previously familiar to the author, who,\r\nin endeavoring to verify the theory, seriously injured his sight, by\r\nobserving with inadequate instrumental means. This is the periodicity of\r\nthe spots.\r\n\r\nWe have already observed, that there is reason to suppose that the\r\naction of the inner vortex of the earth is probably greater than that of\r\nthe outer vortex, on account of the conflicting currents by which it is\r\ncaused. And the full development of this vortex requires, that the\r\ncentral vortex or mechanical axis of the system shall be nearly\r\ntangential to the surface. In this position, the action of the central\r\nvortex is itself at a maximum; and, when the planets of the system are\r\nso arranged as to produce this result, we may expect the greatest number\r\nof spots. If the axis or central vortex approaches to coincidence with\r\nthe axis of the sun, the lateral vortices disappear, and the central\r\nvortex being then perpendicular to the surface, is rendered ineffective.\r\nUnder these circumstances, there will be no spots on the sun's disc.\r\nWhen, on the other hand, all the planets conspire at the same side to\r\nforce the sun out from the mechanical centre of the system, the surface\r\nis too distant to be acted on by the central vortex, and the lateral\r\nvortices are also thrown clear of the sun's surface, on account of the\r\ngreater velocity of the parts of the vortex, in sweeping past the body\r\nof the sun. In this case, there will be but few spots. The case in which\r\nthe axis of the vortex coincides with the axis of the sun, is much more\r\ntransient than the first position, and hence, although the interval\r\nbetween the maxima will be tolerably uniform, there will be an\r\nirregularity between a particular maximum, and the preceding and\r\nsubsequent minimum.\r\n\r\nThe following table exhibits the solar spots, as determined by Schwabe,\r\nof Dessau:\r\n\r\n  Year of observation.

He found a\r\nsufficient correspondence between the minima of spots to confirm the\r\nexplanation given by the theory, and this was still more confirmed by\r\nthe more exact determination of Schwabe; yet there was a little\r\ndiscrepancy in the synchronous values of the ordinates, when the theory\r\nwas graphically compared with the table. Previous to the discovery of\r\nNeptune, the theory corresponded much better than afterwards, and as no\r\ndoubt could be entertained that the anomalous movements of Uranus were\r\ncaused by an exterior planet, he adopted the notion that there were two\r\nplanets exterior to Uranus, whose positions at the time were such, that\r\ntheir mechanical affects on the system were about equal and contrary.\r\nConsequently, when Neptune became known, the existence of another planet\r\nseemed a conclusion necessary to adopt. Accordingly, he calculated the\r\nheliocentric longitudes and true anomalies, and the values of radius\r\nvector, for all the planets during the present century, but not having\r\nany planetary tables, he contented himself with computing for the\r\nnearest degree of true anomaly, and the nearest thousand miles of\r\ndistance. Then by a composition and resolution of all the forces, he\r\ndeduced the radius vector of the sun, and the longitude of his centre,\r\nfor each past year of the century. It was in view of a little\r\noutstanding discrepancy in the times of the minima, as determined by\r\ntheory and observation, that he was induced to consider as almost\r\ncertain the existence of a theoretical planet, whose longitude, in 1828,\r\nwas about 90d, and whose period is from the theory about double that of\r\nNeptune. And for convenience of computation and reference, he has been\r\nin the habit of symbolizing it by a volcano. The following table of the\r\nradii vectores of the sun, and the longitude of his centre, for the\r\nyears designated in Schwabe's table, is calculated from the following\r\ndata for each planet:\r\n\r\n                                                           Long. of\r\n  Planets.

Hence, the minimum for 1843 appears as\r\npertaining to 1844. The number of spots ought to be inversely as the\r\nordinates approximately--these last being derived from the Radii\r\nVectores minus, the semi-diameter of the sun = 444,000 miles.\r\n\r\nIn passing judgment on this relation, it must also be borne in mind,\r\nthat the recognized masses of the planets cannot be the true masses, if\r\nthe theory be true. Both sun and planets are under-estimated, yet, as\r\nthey are, probably, all to a certain degree proportionally undervalued,\r\nit will not vitiate the above calculation much.\r\n\r\nThe spots being considered as solar storms, they ought also to vary in\r\nnumber at different times of the year, according to the longitude of the\r\nearth and sun, and from their transient character, and the slow rotation\r\nof the sun, they ought, _ceteris paribus_, to be more numerous when the\r\nproducing vortex is over a visible portion of the sun's surface.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of reconciling the solar spots, and their periodicity to\r\nany known principle of physics, ought to produce a more tolerant spirit\r\namongst the scientific for speculations even which may afford the\r\nslightest promise of a solution, although emanating from the humblest\r\ninquirer after truth. The hypothesis of an undiscovered planet, exterior\r\nto Neptune, is of a nature to startle the cautions timidity of many;\r\nbut, if the general theory be true, this hypothesis becomes extremely\r\nprobable. We may not have located it exactly. There may be even two such\r\nplanets, whose joint effect shall be equivalent to one in the position\r\nwe have assigned. There may even be a comet of great mass, capable of\r\nproducing an effect on the position of the sun's centre (although it\r\nfollows from the theory that comets have very little mass). Yet, in view\r\nof all these suppositions, there can be but little doubt that the solar\r\nspots are caused by the solar vortices, and these last made effective on\r\nthe sun by the positions of the great planets, and, therefore, we have\r\nindicated a new method of determining the existence and position of all\r\nthe planets exterior to Neptune. On the supposition that there is only\r\none more in the system, from its deduced distance and mass, it will\r\nappear only as a star of the eleventh magnitude, and, consequently, will\r\nonly be recognizable by its motion, which, at the greatest, will only be\r\nten or eleven seconds per day.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASSES OF THE SUN AND PLANETS.\r\n\r\nWe have alluded to the fact of the radial stream of the sun necessarily\r\ndiminishing the sun's power, and, consequently, diminishing his apparent\r\nmass. The radial stream of all the planets will do the same, so that\r\neach planet whose mass is derived from the periodic times of the\r\nsatellites, will also appear too small. But, there is also a great\r\nprobability that some modification must be made in the wording of the\r\nNewtonian law. The experiments of Newton on the pendulum, with every\r\nvariety of substance, was sufficient justification to entitle him to\r\ninfer, that inertia was as the weight of matter universally. But, there\r\nwas one condition which could not be observed in experimenting on these\r\nsubstances, viz., the difference of temperature existing between the\r\ninterior and surface of a planet.\r\n\r\nWe have already expressed the idea, that the cause of gravity has no\r\nsuch mysterious origin as to transcend the power of man to determine it.\r\nBut that, on the contrary, we are taught by every analogy around us, as\r\nwell as by divine precept, to use the visible things of creation as\r\nstepping stones to the attainment of what is not so apparent. That we\r\nhave the volume of nature spread out in tempting characters, inviting us\r\nto read, and, assuredly, it is not so spread in mockery of man's limited\r\npowers. As science advances, strange things, it is true, are brought to\r\nlight, but the more _rational_ the queries we propound, in every case\r\nthe more satisfactory are the answers. It is only when man consults the\r\noracle in irrational terms that the response is ambiguous. Alchemy, with\r\nits unnatural transmutations, has long since vanished before the\r\nincreasing light. Why should not attraction also? Experience and\r\nexperiment, if men would only follow their indications, are consistently\r\nenforcing the necessity of erasing these antiquated chimeras from the\r\nbook of knowledge; and inculcating the great truth, that the physical\r\nuniverse owes all its endless variety to differences in the form, size,\r\nand density of planetary atoms in motion, according to simple mechanical\r\nprinciples. These, combined with the existence of an all-pervading\r\nmedium filling space, between which and planetary matter no bond of\r\nunion subsists, other than that which arises from a continual\r\ninterchange of motion, are the materials from which the gems of nature\r\nare elaborated. But, simplicity of means is what philosophy has ever\r\nbeen reluctant to admit, preferring rather the occult and obscure.\r\n\r\nIf action be equal to reaction, and all nature be vibrating with motion,\r\nthese motions must necessarily interfere, and some effect should be\r\nproduced. A body radiating its motion on every side into a physical\r\nmedium, produces waves. These waves are a mechanical effect, and the\r\nbody parts with some of its motion in producing them; but, should\r\nanother body be placed in juxtaposition, having the same motion, the\r\nopposing waves neutralize each other, and the bodies lose no motion from\r\ntheir contiguous sides, and, therefore, the reaction from the opposite\r\nsides acts as a propelling power, and the bodies approach, or tend to\r\napproach each other. If one body be of double the inertia, it moves only\r\nhalf as far as the first; then, seeing that this atomic motion is\r\nradiated, the law of force must be directly as the mass, and inversely\r\nas the squares of the distances. There may be other atomic vibrations\r\nbesides those which we call light, heat, and chemical action, yet the\r\njoint effect of all is infinitesimally small, when we disregard the\r\nunited _attraction_ of all the atoms of which the earth is composed. The\r\n_attraction_ of the whole earth at the surface causes bodies to fall 16\r\nfeet the first second of time; but, if two spheres of ice of one foot\r\ndiameter, were placed in an infinite space, uninfluenced by other\r\nmatter, and only 16 feet apart, they would require nearly 10,000 years\r\nto fall together by virtue of their mutual attraction. Our conceptions,\r\nor, rather, our misconceptions, concerning the force of gravity, arises\r\nfrom our forgetting that every pound of matter on the earth contributes\r\nits share of the force which, in the aggregate, is so powerful. Hence,\r\nthe cause we have suggested, is fully adequate to account for the\r\nphenomena. Whether the harmony of vibrations between two bodies may not\r\nhave an influence in determining the amount of interference, and,\r\nconsequently, produce _some_ difference between the gravitating mass\r\nand its inertia, is a question which, no doubt, will ultimately be\r\nsolved; but this harmony of vibrations must depend, in some degree, on\r\nthe atomic weight, temperature, and intensity of atomic motion.\r\n\r\nThat a part of the mass of the earth is _latent_ may be inferred from\r\ncertain considerations: 1st, from the discrepancies existing in the\r\nresults obtained for the earth's compression by the pendulum and by\r\nactual measurement; and, 2d, from the irregularity of that compression\r\nin particular latitudes and longitudes. The same may also be deduced\r\nfrom the different values of the moon's mass as derived from different\r\nphenomena, dependent on the law of gravitation. Astronomers have\r\nhitherto covered themselves with the very convenient shield of errors of\r\nobservation; but, the perfection of modern instruments now demand a\r\nbetter account of all outstanding discrepancies. The world requires it\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThe mass of the moon comes out much greater by our theory than nutation\r\ngives. The mass deduced from the theory is only dependent on the\r\nrelative inertiae of the earth and moon. That given by nutation depends\r\non gravity. If, then, a part of the mass be latent, nutation will give\r\ntoo small a value. But, in addition to this, we are justified in\r\ndoubting the strict wording of the Newtonian law, deriving our authority\r\nfrom the very foundation stone of the Newtonian theory.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Newton suspected that the moon was retained in her\r\norbit by the same force which is usually called weight upon the surface,\r\nsixteen years before the fact was confirmed, by finding a correspondence\r\nin the fall of the moon and the fall of bodies on the earth. Usually, in\r\nall elementary works, this problem is considered accurately solved.\r\nHaving formed a different idea of the mechanism of nature, this fact\r\npresented itself as a barrier beyond which it was impossible to pass,\r\nuntil suspicions, derived from other sources, induced the author to\r\ninquire: Whether the phenomenon did exactly accord with the theory? We\r\nare aware that it is easy to place the moon at such a distance, that the\r\nresult shall strictly correspond with the fact; but, from the parallax,\r\nas derived from observation (and if this cannot be depended on\r\ncertainly, no magnitudes in astronomy can), we find, _that the moon does\r\nnot fall from the tangent of her orbit, as much as the theory requires_.\r\nAs this is of vital importance to the integrity of the theory we are\r\nadvocating, we have made the computation on Newton's own data, except\r\nsuch as were necessarily inaccurate at the time he wrote; and we have\r\ndone it arithmetically, without logarithmic tables, that, if possible,\r\nno error should creep in to vitiate the result. We take the moon's\r\nelements from no less an authority than Sir John Herschel, as well as\r\nthe value of the earth's diameter.\r\n\r\n  Mass of the moon                     1/80\r\n  Mean distance in equatorial radii    59.96435\r\n  Sidereal period in seconds           2360591\r\n\r\nThe vibrations of the pendulum give the force of gravity at the surface\r\nof the earth, and it is found to vary in different latitudes. The\r\nintensity in any place being as the squares of the number of vibrations\r\nin a given time. This inequality depends on the centrifugal force of\r\nrotation, and on the spheroidal figure of the earth due to that\r\nrotation. At the equator the fall of a heavy body is found to be\r\n16.045223 feet, per second, and in that latitude the squares of whose\r\nsine is 1/3, it is 16.0697 feet. The effect in this last-named latitude\r\nis the same as if the earth were a perfect sphere. This does not,\r\nhowever, express the whole force of gravity, as the rotation of the\r\nearth causes a centrifugal tendency which is a maximum at the equator,\r\nand there amounts to 1/289 of the whole gravitating force. In other\r\nlatitudes it is diminished in the ratio of the squares of the cosines of\r\nthe latitude; it therefore becomes 1/434 in that latitude the square of\r\nwhose sine is 1/3. Hence the fall per second becomes 16.1067 feet for\r\nthe true gravitating force of the earth, or for that force which retains\r\nthe moon in her orbit.\r\n\r\nThe moon's mean distance is 59.96435 equatorial radii of the earth,\r\nwhich radius is, according to Sir John Herschel, 20.923.713\r\nfeet. Her mean distance as derived from the parallax is not to be\r\nconsidered the radius vector of the orbit, inasmuch as the earth also\r\ndescribes a small orbit around the common centre of gravity of the earth\r\nand moon; neither is radius vector to be considered as her distance from\r\nthis common centre; for the attracting power is in the centre of the\r\nearth. But the mean distance of the moon moving around a movable centre,\r\nis to the same mean distance when the centre of attraction is fixed, as\r\nthe sum of the masses of the two bodies, to the first of two mean\r\nproportionals between this sum and the largest of the two bodies\r\ninversely. (Vid. Prin. Prop. 60 Lib. Prim.) The ratio of the masses\r\nbeing as above 80 to 1 the mean proportional sought is 80.666 and in\r\nthis ratio must the moon's mean distance be diminished to get the force\r\nof gravity at the moon. Therefore as 81 is to 80.666, so is 59.96435 to\r\n59.71657 for the moon's distance in equatorial radii of the earth.\r\nMultiply this last by 20.923,713 to bring the semi-diameter of the lunar\r\norbit into feet = 1.249.492.373, and this by 6.283185, the ratio of the\r\ncircumference to the radius, gives 7.850.791.736 feet, for the mean\r\ncircumference of the lunar orbit.\r\n\r\nFurther, the mean sidereal period of the moon is 2360591 seconds and the\r\n1/2360591th part of 7.850.791.736 is the arc the moon describes in one\r\nsecond = 3325.77381 feet, the square of which divided by the diameter\r\nof the orbit, gives the fall of the moon from the tangent or versed\r\nsize of that arc.\r\n\r\n    1106771.36876644\r\n  = ---------------- = 0.004426106 feet.\r\n       2498984746\r\n\r\nThis fraction is, however, too small, as the ablatitious action of the\r\nsun diminishes the attraction of the earth on the moon, in the ratio of\r\n178 29/40 to 177 29/40. So that we must increase the fall of the moon\r\nin the ratio of 711 to 715, and hence the true fall of the moon from the\r\ntangent of her orbit becomes 0.00451 feet per second.\r\n\r\nWe have found the fall of a body at the surface of the earth, considered\r\nas a sphere, 16.1067 feet per second, and the force of gravity\r\ndiminishes as the squares of the distances increases. The polar diameter\r\nof the earth is set down as 7899.170 miles, and the equatorial diameter\r\n7925.648 miles; therefore, the mean diameter is 7916.189 miles.[36] So\r\nthat, reckoning in mean radii of the earth, the moon's distance is\r\n59.787925, which squared, is equal to 3574.595975805625. At one mean\r\nradius distance, that is, at the surface, the force of gravity, or fall\r\nper second, is as above, 16.1067 feet. Divide this by the square of the\r\ndistance, it is 16.1067/3574.595975805625 = 0.0045058 feet for the force\r\nof gravity at the moon. But, from the preceding calculation, it appears,\r\nthat the moon only falls 0.0044510 feet in a second, showing a\r\ndeficiency of 1/82d part of the principal force that retains the moon in\r\nher orbit, being more than double the whole disturbing power of the sun,\r\nwhich is only 1/178th of the earth's gravity at the moon; yet, on this\r\n1/178th depends the revolution of the lunar apogee and nodes, and all\r\nthose variations which clothe the lunar theory with such formidable\r\ndifficulties. The moon's mass cannot be less than 1/80, and if we\r\nconsider it greater, as it no doubt is, the results obtained will be\r\nstill more discrepant. Much of this discrepancy is owing to the\r\nexpulsive power of the radial stream of the terral vortex; yet, it may\r\nbe suspected that the effect is too great to be attributed to this, and,\r\nfor this reason, we have suggested that the fused matter of the moon's\r\ncentre may not gravitate with the same force as the exterior parts, and\r\nthus contribute to increase the discrepancy.\r\n\r\nAs there must be a similar effect produced by the radial stream of every\r\nvortex, the masses of all the planets will appear too small, as derived\r\nfrom their gravitating force; and the inertia of the sun will also be\r\ngreater than his apparent mass; and if, in addition to this, there be a\r\nportion of these masses latent, we shall have an ample explanation of\r\nthe connection between the planetary densities and distances. We must\r\ntherefore inquire what is the particular law of force which governs the\r\nradial stream of the solar vortex. It will be necessary to enter into\r\nthis question a little more in detail than our limits will justify; but\r\nit is the resisting influence of the ether, and its consequences, which\r\nwill appear to present a vulnerable point in the present theory, and to\r\nbe incompatible with the perfection of astronomical science.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW OF DENSITY IN SOLAR VORTEX.\r\n\r\nReverting to the dynamical principle, that the product of every particle\r\nof matter in a fluid vortex, moving around a given axis, by its distance\r\nfrom the centre and angular velocity, must ever be a constant quantity,\r\nit follows that if the ethereal medium be uniformly dense, the periodic\r\ntimes of the parts of the vortex will be directly as the distances from\r\nthe centre or axis; but the angular velocities being inversely as the\r\ntimes, the absolute velocities will be equal at all distances from the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nNewton, in examining the doctrine of the Cartesian vortices, supposes\r\nthe case of a globe in motion, gradually communicating that motion to\r\nthe surrounding fluid, and finds that the periodic times will be in the\r\nduplicate ratio of the distances from the centre of the globe. He and\r\nhis successors have always assumed that it was impossible for the\r\nprinciple of gravity to be true, and a Cartesian plenum also;\r\nconsequently, the question has not been fairly treated. It is true that\r\nDescartes sought to explain the motions of the planets, by the\r\nmechanical action of a fluid vortex _solely_; and to Newton belongs the\r\nglorious honor of determining, the existence of a centripetal force,\r\ncompetent to explain these motions mathematically, (but not physically,)\r\nand rashly rejected an intelligible principle for a miraculous virtue.\r\nIf our theory be true, the visible creation depends on the existence of\r\nboth working together in harmony, and that a physical medium is\r\nabsolutely necessary to the existence of gravitation.\r\n\r\nIf space be filled with a fluid medium, analogy would teach us that it\r\nis in motion, and that there must be inequalities in the direction and\r\nvelocity of that motion, and consequently there must be vortices. And if\r\nwe ascend into the history of the past, we shall find ample testimony\r\nthat the planetary matter now composing the members of the solar system,\r\nwas once one vast nebulous cloud of atoms, partaking of the vorticose\r\nmotion of the fluid involving them. Whether the gradual accumulation of\r\nthese atoms round a central nucleus from the surrounding space, and thus\r\nhaving their tangential motion of translation converted into vorticose\r\nmotion, first produced the vortex in the ether; or whether the vortex\r\nhad previously existed, in consequence of conflicting currents in the\r\nether, and the scattered atoms of space were drawn into the vortex by\r\nthe polar current, thus forming a nucleus at the centre, as a necessary\r\nresult of the eddy which would obtain there, is of little consequence.\r\nThe ultimate result would be the same. A nucleus, once formed, would\r\ngive rise to a central force, tending more and more to counteract the\r\ncentripulsive power of the radial stream; and in consequence of this\r\ncontinually increasing central power, the heaviest atoms would be best\r\nenabled to withstand the radial stream, while the lighter atoms might be\r\ncarried away to the outer boundaries of the vortex, to congregate at\r\nleisure, and, after the lapse of a thousand years, to again face the\r\nradial stream in a more condensed mass, and to force a passage to the\r\nvery centre of the vortex, in an almost parabolic curve. That space is\r\nfilled with isolated atoms or planetary dust, is rendered very probable\r\nby a fact discovered by Struve, that there is a gradual extinction in\r\nthe light of the stars, amounting to a loss of 1/107 of the whole, in\r\nthe distance which separates Sirius from the sun. According to Struve,\r\nthis can be accounted for, \"by admitting as very probable that space is\r\nfilled with an _ether_, capable of intercepting in some degree the\r\nlight.\" Is it not as probable that this extinction is due to planetary\r\ndust, scattered through the pure ether, whose vibrations convey the\r\nlight,--the material atoms of future worlds,--the debris of dilapidated\r\ncomets? Does not the Scripture teach the same thing, in asserting that\r\nthe heavens are not clean?\r\n\r\nThe theory of vortices has had many staunch supporters amongst those\r\ndeeply versed in the science of the schools. The Bernoullis proposed\r\nseveral ingenious hypothesis, to free the Cartesian system from the\r\nobjections urged against it, viz.: that the velocities of the planets,\r\nin accordance with the three great laws of Kepler, cannot be made to\r\ncorrespond with the motion of a fluid vortex; but they, and all others,\r\ngave the vantage ground to the defenders of the Newtonian philosophy, by\r\nseeking to refer the principle of gravitation to conditions dependent on\r\nthe density and vorticose motion of the ether. When we admit that the\r\nether is imponderable and yet material, and planetary matter subject to\r\nthe law of gravitation, the objections urged against the theory of\r\nvortices become comparatively trivial, and we shall not stop to refute\r\nthem, but proceed with the investigation, and consider that the ether is\r\nthe original source of the planetary motions and arrangements.\r\n\r\nOn the supposition that the ether is uniformly dense, we have shown that\r\nthe periodic times will be directly as the distances from the axis. If\r\nthe density be inversely as the distances, the periodic times will be\r\nequal. If the density be inversely as the square roots of the distances,\r\nthe times will be directly in the same ratio. The celebrated J.\r\nBernoulli assumed this last ratio; but seeking the source of motion in\r\nthe rotating central globe, he was led into a hypothesis at variance\r\nwith analogy. The ellipticity of the orbit, according to this view,\r\nwas caused by the planet oscillating about a mean position,--sinking\r\nfirst into the dense ether,--then, on account of superior buoyancy,\r\nrising into too light a medium. Even if no other objection could be\r\nurged to this view, the difficulty of explaining why the ether should be\r\ndenser near the sun, would still remain. We might make other\r\nsuppositions; for whatever ratio of the distances we assume for the\r\ndensity of the medium, the periodic times will be compounded of those\r\ndistances and the assumed ratio. Seeing, therefore, that the periodic\r\ntimes of the planets observe the direct ses-plicate ratio of the\r\ndistances, and that it is consonant to all analogy to suppose the\r\ncontiguous parts of the vortex to have the same ratio, we find that the\r\ndensity of the ethereal medium in the solar vortex, is directly as the\r\nsquare roots of the distances from the axis.\r\n\r\nAgainst this view, it may be urged that if the inertia of the medium is\r\nso small, as is supposed, and its elasticity so great, there can be no\r\ncondensation by centrifugal force of rotation. It is true that when we\r\nsay the ether is condensed by this force, we speak incorrectly. If in an\r\ninfinite space of imponderable fluid a vortex is generated, the central\r\nparts are rarefied, and the exterior parts are unchanged. But in all\r\nfinite vortices there must be a limit, outside of which the motion is\r\nnull, or perhaps contrary. In this case there may be a cylindrical ring,\r\nwhere the medium will be somewhat denser than outside. Just as in water,\r\nevery little vortex is surrounded by a circular wave, visible by\r\nreflection. As the density of the planet Neptune appears, from present\r\nindications, to be a little denser than Uranus, and Uranus is denser\r\nthan Saturn, we may conceive that there is such a wave in the solar\r\nvortex, near which rides this last magnificent planet, whose ring would\r\nthus be an appropriate emblem of the peculiar position occupied by\r\nSaturn. This may be the case, although the probability is, that the\r\ndensity of Saturn is much greater than it appears, as we shall presently\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\nIn order to show that there is nothing extravagant in the supposition of\r\nthe density of the ether being directly as the square roots of the\r\ndistances from the axis, we will take a fluid whose law of density is\r\nknown, and calculate the effect of the centrifugal force, considered as\r\na compressing power. Let us assume our atmosphere to be 47 miles high,\r\nand the compressing power of the earth's gravity to be 289 times greater\r\nthan the centrifugal force of the equator, and the periodic time of\r\nrotation necessary to give a centrifugal force at the equator equal to\r\nthe gravitating force to be 83 minutes. Now, considering the gravitating\r\nforce to be uniform, from the surface of the earth upwards, and knowing\r\nfrom observation that at 18,000 feet above the surface, the density of\r\nthe air is only 1/2, it follows, (in accordance with the principle that\r\nthe density is as the compressing force,) that at 43 1/2 miles high, or\r\n18,000 feet _below_ the surface of the atmosphere, the density is only\r\n1/8000 part of the density at the surface of the earth. Let us\r\ntake this density as being near the limit of expansion, and conceive a\r\nhollow tube, reaching from the sun to the orbit of Neptune, and that\r\nthis end of the tube is closed, and the end at the sun communicates with\r\nan inexhaustible reservoir of such an attenuated gas as composes the\r\nupper-layer of our atmosphere; and further, that the tube is infinitely\r\nstrong to resist pressure, without offering resistance to the passage of\r\nthe air within the tube; then we say, that, if the air within the tube\r\nbe continually acted on by a force equal to the mean centrifugal force\r\nof the solar vortex, reckoning from the sun to the orbit of Neptune, the\r\ndensity of the air at that extremity of the tube, would be greater than\r\nthe density of a fluid formed by the compression of the ocean into one\r\nsingle drop. For the centrifugal force of the vortex at 2,300,000 miles\r\nfrom the centre of the sun, is equal to gravity at the surface of the\r\nearth, and taking the mean centrifugal force of the whole vortex as\r\none-millionth of this last force; so that at 3,500,000 miles from the\r\nsurface of the sun, the density of the air in the tube (supposing it\r\nobstructed at that distance) would be double the density of the\r\nattenuated air in the reservoir. And the air at the extremity of the\r\ntube reaching to the orbit of Neptune, would be as much denser than the\r\nair we breathe, as a number expressed by 273 with 239 ciphers annexed,\r\nis greater than unity. This is on the supposition of infinite\r\ncompressibility. Now, in the solar vortex there is no physical barrier\r\nto oppose the passage of the ether from the centre to the circumference,\r\nand the density of the ethereal ocean must be considered uniform, except\r\nin the interior of the stellar vortices, where it will be rarefied; and\r\nthe rarefaction will depend on the centrifugal force and the length of\r\nthe axis of the vortex. If this axis be very long, and the centrifugal\r\nvelocity very great, the polar influx will not be sufficient, and the\r\ncentral parts will be rarefied. We see, therefore, no reason why the\r\ndensity of the ether may not be three times greater at Saturn than at\r\nthe earth, or as the square roots of the distances directly.\r\n\r\n\r\nBODES' LAW OF PLANETARY DISTANCES.\r\n\r\nThus, in the solar vortex, there will be two polar currents meeting at\r\nthe sun, and thence being deflected at right angles, in planes parallel\r\nto the central plane of the vortex, and strongest in that central plane.\r\nThe velocity of expansion must, therefore, diminish from the divergence\r\nof the radii, as the distances increase; but in advancing along these\r\nplanes, the ether of the vortex is continually getting more dense,\r\nwhich operate by absorption or condensation on the radial stream; so\r\nthat the velocity is still more diminished, and this in the ratio of the\r\nsquare roots of the distances directly. By combining these two ratios,\r\nwe find that the velocity of the radial stream will be in the\r\nses-plicate ratio of the distances inversely. But the force of this\r\nstream is not as the velocity, but as the square of the velocity. The\r\n_force_ of the radial stream is consequently as the cubes of the\r\ndistances inversely, from the axis of the vortex, reckoned in the same\r\nplane. If the ether, however, loses in velocity by the increasing\r\ndensity of the medium, it becomes also more dense; therefore the true\r\nforce of the radial stream will be as its density and the square of its\r\nvelocity, or directly as the square roots of the distances, and\r\ninversely as the cubes of the distances, or as the 2.5 power of the\r\ndistances inversely.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the central plane of the vortex as coincident with the\r\nplane of the ecliptic, and the planetary orbits, also, in the same\r\nplane; and had the force of the radial stream been inversely as the\r\nsquare of the distances, there could be no disturbance produced by the\r\naction of the radial stream. It would only counteract the gravitation of\r\nthe central body by a certain amount, and would be exactly proportioned\r\nat all distances. As it is, there is an outstanding force as a\r\ndisturbing force, which is in the inverse ratio of the square roots of\r\nthe distances from the sun; and to this is, no doubt, owing, in part,\r\nthe fact, that the planetary distances are arranged in the inverse order\r\nof their densities.\r\n\r\nSuppose two planets to have the same diameter to be placed in the same\r\norbit, they will only be in equilibrium when their densities are equal.\r\nIf their densities are unequal, the lighter planet will continually\r\nenlarge its orbit, until the force of the radial stream becomes\r\nproportional to the planets' resisting energy. This, however, is on the\r\nhypothesis that the planets are not permeable by the radial stream,\r\nwhich, perhaps, is more consistent with analogy than with the reality.\r\nAnd it is more probable that the mean atomic weight of a planet's\r\nelements tends more to fix the position of equilibrium for each. Under\r\nthe law of gravity, a planet may revolve at any distance from the sun,\r\nbut if we superadd a centripulsive force, whose law is not that of\r\ngravity, but yet in some inverse ratio of the distances, and this force\r\nacts only superficially, it would be possible to make up in volume what\r\nis wanted in density, and a lighter planet might thus be found occupying\r\nthe position of a dense planet. So the planet Jupiter, respecting only\r\nhis resisting surface, is better able to withstand the force of the\r\nradial stream at the earth than the earth itself. To understand this, it\r\nis necessary to bear in mind, that, as far as planetary matter is\r\nconcerned, the earth would revolve in Jupiter's orbit in the same\r\nperiodic time as Jupiter, under the law of gravity: but that, in\r\nreality, the whole of the gravitating force is not effective, and that\r\nthe equilibrium of a planet is due to a nice balance of interfering\r\nforces arising from the planet's physical peculiarities. As in a\r\nrefracting body, the density of the ether may be considered inversely as\r\nthe refraction, and this as the atomic weight of the refracting\r\nmaterial, so, also, in a planet, the density of the ether will be\r\ninversely in the same ratio of the density of the matter approximately.\r\nHence, the density of the ether within the planet Jupiter is greater\r\nthan that within the earth; and, on this ethereal matter, the sun has no\r\npower to restrain it in its orbit, so that the centrifugal momentum of\r\nJupiter would be relatively greater than the centrifugal momentum of the\r\nearth, were it also in Jupiter's orbit with the same periodic time.\r\nHence, to make an equilibrium, the earth should revolve in a medium of\r\nless density, that there may be the same proportion between the external\r\nether, and the ether within the earth, as there is between the ether\r\naround Jupiter and the ether within; so that the centrifugal tendency of\r\nthe dense ether at Jupiter shall counteract the greater momentum of the\r\ndense ether within Jupiter; or, that the lack of centrifugal momentum in\r\nthe earth should be rendered equal to the centrifugal momentum of\r\nJupiter, by the deficiency of the centrifugal momentum of the ether at\r\nthe distance of the earth.\r\n\r\nIf then, the diameters of all the planets were the same (supposing the\r\nether to act only superficially), the densities would be as the\r\ndistances inversely;[37] for the force due to the radial stream is as\r\nthe square roots of the distance inversely, and the force due to the\r\nmomentum, if the density of the ether within a planet be inversely as\r\nthe square root of a planet's distance, will also be inversely as the\r\nsquare roots of the distances approximately. We offer these views,\r\nhowever, only as suggestions to others more competent to grapple with\r\nthe question, as promising a satisfactory solution of Bode's empirical\r\nformula.\r\n\r\nIf there be a wave of denser ether cylindrically disposed around the\r\nvortex at the distance of Saturn, or between Saturn and Uranus, we see\r\nwhy the law of densities and distances is not continuous. For, if the\r\nlaw of density changes, it must be owing to such a ring or wave. Inside\r\nthis wave, the two forces will be inverse; but outside, one will be\r\ninverse, and the other direct: hence, there should also be a change in\r\nthe law of distances. As this change does not take place until we pass\r\nUranus, it may be suspected that the great disparity in the density of\r\nSaturn may be more apparent than real. The density of a planet is the\r\nrelation between its mass and volume or extension, no matter what the\r\nform of the body may be. From certain observations of Sir Wm.\r\nHerschel--the Titan of practical astronomers--the figure of Saturn was\r\nsuspected to be that of a square figure, with the corners rounded off,\r\nso as to leave both the equatorial and polar zones flatter than\r\npertained to a true spheroidal figure. The existence of an unbroken ring\r\naround Saturn, certainly attaches a peculiarity to this planet which\r\nprepares us to meet other departures from the usual order. And when we\r\nreflect on the small density, and rapid rotation, the formation of this\r\nring, and the figure suspected by Sir Wm. Herschel, it is neither\r\nimpossible nor improbable, that there may be a cylindrical vacant space\r\nsurrounding the axis of Saturn, or at least, that his solid parts may be\r\ncylindrical, and his globular form be due to elastic gases and vapors,\r\nwhich effectually conceal his polar openings. And also, by dilating and\r\ncontracting at the poles, in consequence of inclination to the radial\r\nstream, (just as the earth's atmosphere is bulged out sufficiently to\r\naffect the barometer at certain hours every day,) give that peculiarity\r\nof form in certain positions of the planet in its orbit. Justice to Sir\r\nWm. Herschel requires that _his_ observations shall not be attributed to\r\noptical illusions. This view, however, which may be true in the case of\r\nSaturn, would be absurd when applied to the earth, as has been done\r\nwithin the present century. From these considerations, it is at least\r\npossible, that the density of Saturn may be very little less, or even\r\ngreater than the density of Uranus, and be in harmony with the law of\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\nIt is now apparently satisfactorily determined, that Neptune is denser\r\nthan Uranus, and the law being changed, we must look for transneptunean\r\nplanets at distances corresponding with the new law of arrangement. But\r\nthere are other modifying causes which have an influence in fixing the\r\nprecise position of equilibrium of a planet. Each planet of the system\r\npossessing rotation, is surrounded by an ethereal vortex, and each\r\nvortex has its own radial stream, the force of which in opposing the\r\nradial stream of the sun, depends on the diameter and density of the\r\nplanet, on the velocity of rotation, on the inclination of its axis, and\r\non the density of the ether at each particular vortex; but the numerical\r\nverification of the position of each planet with the forces we have\r\nmentioned, cannot be made in the present state of the question. There is\r\none fact worthy of note, as bearing on the theory of vortices in\r\nconnection with the rotation of the planets, viz.: that observation has\r\ndetermined that the axial rotation and sidereal revolution of the\r\nsecondaries, are identical; thus showing that they are without vortices,\r\nand are motionless relative to the ether of the vortex to which they\r\nbelong. We may also advert to the theory of Doctor Olbers, that the\r\nasteroidal group, are the fragments of a larger planet which once\r\nfilled the vacancy between Mars and Jupiter. Although this idea is not\r\ngenerally received, it is gathering strength every year by the discovery\r\nof other _fragments_, whose number now amounts to twenty-six. If the\r\nidea be just, our theory offers an explanation of the great differences\r\nobservable in the mean distances of these bodies, and which would\r\notherwise form a strong objection against the hypothesis. For if these\r\nlittle planets be fragments, there will be differences of density\r\naccording as they belonged to the central or superficial parts of the\r\nquondam planet, and their mean distances must consequently vary also.\r\n\r\nThere are some other peculiarities connecting the distances and\r\ndensities, to which we shall devote a few words. In the primordial state\r\nof the system, when the nebulous masses agglomerated into spheres, the\r\ndiameter of these nebulous spheres would be determined by the relation\r\nexisting between the rotation of the mass, and the gravitating force at\r\nthe centre; for as long as the centrifugal force at the equator exceeded\r\nthe gravitating force, there would be a continual throwing off of matter\r\nfrom the equator, as fast as it was brought from the poles, until a\r\nbalance was produced. It is also extremely probable, (especially if the\r\nelementary components of water are as abundant in other planets as we\r\nhave reason to suppose them to be on the earth,) that the condensation\r\nof the gaseous planets into liquids and solids, was effected in a _brief\r\nperiod of time_,[38] leaving the lighter and more elastic substances as\r\na nebulous atmosphere around globes of semi-fluid matter, whose\r\ndiameters have never been much increased by the subsequent condensation\r\nof their gaseous envelopes. The extent of these atmospheres being (in\r\nthe way pointed out) determined by the rotation, their subsequent\r\ncondensation has not therefore changed the original rotation of the\r\ncentral globe by any appreciable quantity. The present rotation of the\r\nplanets, is therefore competent to determine the former diameters of the\r\nnebulous planets, _i.e._, the limit where the present central force\r\nwould be balanced by the centrifugal force of rotation. If we make the\r\ncalculation for the planets, and take for the unit of each planet its\r\npresent diameter, we shall find that they have condensed from their\r\noriginal nebulous state, by a quantity dependent on the distance, from\r\nthe centre of the system; and therefore on the original temperature of\r\nthe nebulous mass at that particular distance. Let us make the\r\ncalculation for Jupiter and the earth, and call the original nebulous\r\nplanets the nucleus of the vortex. We find the Equatorial diameter of\r\nJupiter's nucleus in equatorial diameters of Jupiter = 2.21, and the\r\nequatorial diameter of the earth's nucleus, in equatorial diameters of\r\nthe earth = 6.59. Now, if we take the original temperature of the\r\nnebulous planets to be inversely, as the squares of the distances from\r\nthe sun, and their volumes directly as the cubes of the diameters in the\r\nunit of each, we find that these cubes are to each other, in the inverse\r\nratio of the squares of the planet's distances; for,\r\n\r\n  2.21^3 : 6.59^3 :: 1^2 : 5.2^2,\r\n\r\nshowing that both planets have condensed equally, allowing for the\r\ndifference of temperature at the beginning. And we shall find, beginning\r\nat the sun, that the diameters of the nebulous planets, _ceteris\r\nparibus_, diminish outwards, giving for the nebulous sun a diameter of\r\n16,000,000 miles,[39] thus indicating his original great temperature.\r\n\r\nThat the original nebulous planets did rotate in the same time as they\r\ndo at present, is proved by Saturn's ring; for if we make the\r\ncalculation, about twice the diameter of Saturn. Now, the diameter of\r\nthe planet is about 80,000 miles, which will also be the semi-diameter\r\nof the nebulous planet; and the middle of the outer ring has also a\r\nsemi-diameter of 80,000 miles; therefore, the ring is the equatorial\r\nportion of the original nebulous planet, and ought, on this theory, to\r\nrotate in the same time as Saturn. According to Sir John Herschel,\r\nSaturn rotates in 10 hours, 29 minutes, and 17 seconds, and the ring\r\nrotates in 10 hours, 29 minutes, and 17 seconds: yet this is not the\r\nperiodic time of a satellite, at the distance of the middle of the ring;\r\nneither ought the rings to rotate in the same time; yet as far as\r\nobservation can be trusted, both the inner and outer ring do actually\r\nrotate in the same time. The truth is, the ring rotates too fast, if we\r\nderive its centrifugal force from the analogy of its satellites; but it\r\nis, no doubt, in equilibrium; and the effective mass of Saturn on the\r\nsatellites is less than the true mass, in consequence of his radial\r\nstream being immensely increased by the additional force impressed on\r\nthe ether, by the centrifugal velocity of the ring. If this be so, the\r\nmass of Saturn, derived from one of the inner satellites, will be less\r\nthan the same mass derived from the great satellite, whose orbit is\r\nconsiderably inclined. The analogy we have mentioned, between the\r\ndiameters of the nebulous planets and their distances, does not hold\r\ngood in the case of Saturn, for the reason already assigned, viz.: that\r\nthe nebulous planet was probably not a globe, but a cylindrical ring,\r\nvacant around the axis, as there is reason to suppose is the case at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAnd now we have to ask the question, Did the ether involved in the\r\nnebulous planets rotate in the same time? This does not necessarily\r\nfollow. The ether will undoubtedly tend to move with increasing velocity\r\nto the very centre of motion, obeying the great dynamical principle when\r\nunresisted. If resisted, the law will perhaps be modified; but in this\r\ncase, its motion of translation will be converted into atomic motion or\r\nheat, according to the motion lost by the resistance of atomic matter.\r\nThis question has a bearing on many geological phenomena. As regards the\r\ngeneral effect, however, the present velocity of the ether circulating\r\nround the planets, may be considered much greater than the velocities of\r\nthe planets themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERTURBATIONS DUE TO THE ETHER.\r\n\r\nIn these investigations it is necessary to bear in mind that the whole\r\nresisting power of the ether, in disturbing the planetary movements, is\r\nbut small, in comparison with gravitation. We will, however, show that,\r\nin the case of the planets, there is a compensation continually made by\r\nthis resistance, which leaves but a very small outstanding balance as a\r\ndisturbing power. If we suppose all the planets to move in the central\r\nplane of the vortex in circular orbits, and the force of the radial\r\nstream, (or that portion which is not in accordance with the law of\r\ngravitation,) to be inversely as the square roots of the distances from\r\nthe sun, it is evident, from what has been advanced, that an equilibrium\r\ncould still obtain, by variations in the densities, distances and\r\ndiameter of the planets. Supposing, again, that the planets still move\r\nin the same plane, but in elliptical orbits, and that they are in\r\nequilibrium at their mean distances, under the influence or action of\r\nthe tangential current, the radial stream, and the density of the ether;\r\nwe see that the force of the radial stream is too great at the\r\nperihelion, and too small at the aphelion. At the perihelion the planet\r\nis urged from the sun and at the aphelion towards the sun. The density\r\nand consequent momentum is also relatively too great at the perihelion,\r\nwhich also urges the planet from the sun, and at the aphelion,\r\nrelatively too small, which urges the planet towards sun; and the law is\r\nthe same in both cases, being null at the mean distance of the planet,\r\nat a maximum at the apsides; it is, consequently, as the cosine of the\r\nplanet's eccentric anomaly at other distances, and is positive or\r\nnegative, according as the planet's distance is above or below the mean.\r\n\r\nAt the planet's mean distance, the circular velocity of the vortex is\r\nequal to the circular velocity of the planet, and, at different\r\ndistances, is inversely in the sub-duplicate ratio of those distances.\r\nBut the circular velocity of a planet in the same orbit, is in the\r\nsimple ratio of the distances inversely. At the perihelion, the planet\r\ntherefore moves faster than the ether of the vortex, and at the\r\naphelion, slower; and the difference is as the square roots of the\r\ndistances; but the force of resistance is as the square of the velocity,\r\nand is therefore in the simple ratio of the distances, as we have\r\nalready found for the effect of the radial stream, and centrifugal\r\nmomentum of the internal ether. At the perihelion this excess of\r\ntangential velocity creates a resistance, which urges the planet towards\r\nthe sun, and at the aphelion, the deficiency of tangential velocity\r\nurges the planet from the sun,--the maximum effect being at the apsides\r\nof the orbit, and null at the mean distances. In other positions it is,\r\ntherefore, as the cosines of the eccentric anomaly, as in the former\r\ncase; but in this last case it is an addititious force at the\r\nperihelion, and an ablatitious force at the aphelion, whereas the first\r\ndisturbing force was an ablatitious force at the perihelion, and an\r\naddititious force at the aphelion; therefore, as we must suppose the\r\nplanet to be in equilibrium at its mean distance, it is in equilibrium\r\nat all distances. Hence, a planet moving in the central plane of the\r\nvortex, experiences no disturbance from the resistance of the ether.\r\n\r\nAs the eccentricities of the planetary orbits are continually changing\r\nunder the influence of the law of gravitation, we must inquire whether,\r\nunder these circumstances, such a change would not produce a permanent\r\nderangement by a change in the mean force of the radial stream, so as to\r\nincrease or diminish the mean distance of the planet from the sun. The\r\nlaw of force deduced from the theory for the radial stream is as the 2.5\r\npower of the distances inversely. But, by dividing this ratio, we may\r\nmake the investigation easier; for it is equivalent to two forces, one\r\nbeing as the squares of the distances, and another as the square roots\r\nof the distances. For the former force, we find that in orbits having\r\nthe same major axis the mean effect will be as the minor axis of the\r\nellipse _inversely_, so that two planets moving in different orbits, but\r\nat the same mean distance, experience a less or greater amount of\r\ncentripulsive force from this radial stream, according as their orbits\r\nare of less or greater eccentricity, and this in the ratio of the minor\r\naxis. On the other hand, under the influence of a force acting\r\ncentripulsively in the inverse ratio of the square roots of the\r\ndistances, we find the mean effect to be as the minor axis of the\r\nellipse _directly_, so that two planets in orbits of different\r\neccentricity, but having the same major axis, experience a different\r\namount from the action of this radial stream, the least eccentric orbit\r\nbeing that which receives the greatest mean effect. By combining these\r\ntwo results, we get a ratio of equality; and, consequently, the action\r\nof the radial stream will be the same for the same orbit, whatever\r\nchange may take place in the eccentricity, and the mean distance of the\r\nplanet will be unchanged. A little consideration will also show that the\r\neffect of the centrifugal momentum due to the density of ether will also\r\nbe the same by change of eccentricity; for the positive will always\r\nbalance the negative effect at the greatest and least distances of the\r\nplanet. The same remark applies to the effect of the tangential current,\r\nso that no change can be produced in the major axes of the planetary\r\norbits by change of eccentricity, as an effect of the resistance of the\r\nether.\r\n\r\nWe will now suppose a planet's orbit to be inclined to the central plane\r\nof the vortex, and in this case, also, we find, that the action of the\r\nradial stream tends to increase the inclination in one quadrant as much\r\nas it diminishes it in the next quadrant, so that no change of\r\ninclination will result. But, if the inclination of the orbit be changed\r\nby planetary perturbations, the mean effect of the radial stream will\r\nalso be changed, and this will tell on the major axis of the orbit,\r\nenlarging the orbit when the inclination diminishes, and contracting it\r\nwhen it increases. The change of inclination, however, must be referred\r\nto the central plane of the vortex. Notwithstanding the perfection of\r\nmodern analysis, it is confessed that the recession of the moon's nodes\r\ndoes yet differ from the theory by its 350th part, and a similar\r\ndiscrepancy is found for the advance of the perigee.[40] This theory is\r\nyet far too imperfect to say that the action of the ethereal medium will\r\naccount for these discrepancies; but it certainly wears a promising\r\naspect, worthy the notice of astronomers. There are other minute\r\ndiscordancies between theory and observation in many astronomical\r\nphenomena, which theory _is_ competent to remove. Some of these we shall\r\nnotice presently; and, it may be remarked, that it is in those minute\r\nquantities which, in astronomy, are usually attributed to errors of\r\nobservation, that this theory will eventually find the surest evidence\r\nof its truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEPLER'S THIRD LAW ONLY APPROXIMATELY TRUE.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked: If there be a modifying force in astronomy derived\r\nfrom another source than that of gravitation, why is it that the\r\nelements of the various members of the system derived solely from\r\ngravitation should be so perfect? To this it may be answered, that\r\nalthough astronomers have endeavored to derive every movement in the\r\nheavens from that great principle, they have but partially succeeded.\r\nLet us not surrender our right of examining Nature to the authority of a\r\ngreat name, nor call any man master, either in moral or physical\r\nscience. It is well known that Kepler's law of the planetary distances\r\nand periods, is a direct consequence of the Newtonian Law of\r\ngravitation, and that the squares of the periodic times ought to be\r\nproportional to the cubes of the mean distances. These times are given\r\naccurately by the planets themselves, by the interval elapsing between\r\ntwo consecutive passages of the node, and as in the case of the ancient\r\nplanets we have observations for more than two thousand years past,\r\nthese times are known to the fraction of the second. The determination\r\nof the distances however, depends on the astronomer, and a tyro in the\r\nscience might suppose that these distances were actually measured; and\r\nso they are roughly; but the astronomer does not depend on his\r\ninstruments, he trusts to _analogy_, and the mathematical perfection of\r\na law, which in the abstract is true; but which he does not know is\r\nrigidly exact when applied to physical phenomena. From the immense\r\ndistance of the planets and the smallness of the earth, man is unable to\r\ncommand a base line sufficiently long, to make the horizontal parallax a\r\nsensible angle for the more distant planets; and there are difficulties\r\nof no small magnitude to contend with, with those that are the nearest.\r\nIn the occasional transit of Venus across the sun, however, he is\r\npresented with a means of measuring on an enlarged scale, from which the\r\ndistance of the sun is determined; and by _analogy_ the distance of all\r\nthe planets. Even the parallax of the sun itself is only correct, by\r\nsupposing that the square of the periodic time of Venus is in the same\r\nproportion to the square of the periodic time of the earth as the cube\r\nof her distance is to the cube of the earth's distance. Our next nearest\r\nplanet is Mars, and observations on this planet at its opposition to the\r\nsun, invariably give a larger parallax for the sun--Venus giving 8.5776\"\r\nwhile Mars gives about 10\". It is true that the first is obtained under\r\nmore favorable circumstances; but this does not prove the last to be\r\nincorrect. It is well known that the British Nautical Almanac contains a\r\nlist of stars lying in the path of the planet Mars about opposition,\r\n(for the very purpose of obtaining a correct parallax,) that minute\r\ndifferences of declination may be detected by simultaneous observations\r\nin places having great differences of latitude. Yet strange to say, the\r\nresult is discredited when not conformable to the parallax given by\r\nVenus. If then, we cannot trust the parallax of Mars, _a fortiori_, how\r\ncan we trust the parallax of Jupiter, and say that his mean distance\r\nexactly corresponds to his periodic time? Let us suppose, for instance,\r\nthat the radius vector of Jupiter fell short of that indicated by\r\nanalogy by 10,000 miles, we say that it would be extremely difficult,\r\nnay, utterly impossible, to detect it by instrumental means. Let not\r\nastronomers, therefore, be too sure that there is not a modifying cause,\r\nindependent of gravitation, which they will yet have to recognize. The\r\nmoon's distance is about one-fourth of a million of miles, and Neptune's\r\n2854 millions, or in the ratio of 10,000 to 1; yet even the moon's\r\nparallax is not trusted in determining her mass, how then shall we\r\ndetermine the parallax of Neptune? It is therefore _possible_ that the\r\neffective action of the sun is in some small degree different, on the\r\ndifferent planets, whether due to the action of the ether, to the\r\nsimilarity or dissimilarity of material elements, to the temperature of\r\nthe different bodies, or to all combined, is a question yet to be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nAs another evidence of the necessity of modifying the strict wording of\r\nthe Newtonian law, it is found that the disturbing action of Jupiter on\r\ndifferent bodies, gives different values for the mass of Jupiter. The\r\nmass deduced from Jupiter's action on his satellites, is different from\r\nthat derived from the perturbations of Saturn, and this last does not\r\ncorrespond with that given by Juno: Vesta also gives a different mass\r\nfrom the comet of Encke, and both vary from the preceding values.[41]\r\n\r\nIn the analytical investigation of planetary disturbances, the\r\ndisturbing force is usually divided into a radial and tangential force;\r\nthe first changing the law of gravitation, to which law the elliptic\r\nform of the orbit is due. The radial disturbing force, therefore, being\r\ndirected to or from the centre, can have no influence over the first law\r\nof Kepler, which teaches that the radius vector of each planet having\r\nthe sun as the centre, describes equal areas in equal times. If the\r\nradial disturbing force be exterior to the disturbed body, it will\r\ndiminish the central force, and cause a progressive motion in the\r\naphelion point of the orbit. In the case of the moon this motion is very\r\nrapid, the apogee making an entire revolution in 3232 days. Does this,\r\nhowever, correspond with the law of gravitation? Sir Isaac Newton, in\r\ncalculating the effect of the sun's disturbing force on the motion of\r\nthe moon's apogee, candidly concludes thus: \"Idoque apsis summa singulis\r\nrevolutionibus progrediendo conficit 1d 31' 28\". Apsis lunae est duplo\r\nvelocior circiter.\" As there was a necessity for reconciling this\r\nstubborn fact with the theory, his followers have made up the deficiency\r\nby resorting to the tangential force, or, as Clairant proposed, by\r\ncontinuing the approximations to terms of a higher order, or to the\r\nsquare of the disturbing force.\r\n\r\nNow, in a circular orbit, this tangential force will alternately\r\nincrease and diminish the velocity of the disturbed body, without\r\nproducing any permanent derangement, the same result would obtain in an\r\nelliptical orbit, if the position of the major axis were stationary. In\r\nthe case of the moon, the apogee is caused to advance by the disturbing\r\npower of the radial force, and, consequently, an exact compensation is\r\nnot effected: there remains a small excess of velocity which geometers\r\nhave considered equivalent to a doubling of the radial force, and have\r\nthus obviated the difficulty. To those not imbued with the profound\r\npenetration of the modern analyst, there must ever appear a little\r\ninconsistency in this result. The major axis of a planet's orbit depends\r\nsolely on the velocity of the planet at a given distance from the sun,\r\nand the tangential portion of the disturbance due to the sun, and\r\nimpressed upon the moon, must necessarily increase and diminish\r\nalternately the velocity of the moon, and interfere with the equable\r\ndescription of the areas. If, then, there be left outstanding a small\r\nexcess of velocity over and above the elliptical velocity of the moon,\r\nat the end of each synodical revolution, in consequence of the motion\r\nimpressed on the moon's apogee by the radial force, the _legitimate_\r\neffect would be a small enlargement of the lunar orbit every revolution\r\nin a rapidly-increasing ratio, until the moon would at last be taken\r\nentirely away. In the great inequality of Jupiter and Saturn, this\r\ntangential force is not compensated at each revolution, in consequence\r\nof continual changes in the configuration of the two planets at their\r\nheliocentric conjunctions, with respect to the perihelion of their\r\norbits, and the near commensurability of their periods; and the effect\r\nof the tangential force is, in this case, legitimately impressed on the\r\nmajor axes of the orbits. But why (we may ask) should not this also be\r\nexpended on the motion of the aphelion as well as in the case of the\r\nmoon? Astronomy can make no distinctions between the orbit of a planet\r\nand the orbit of a satellite. And, we might also ask, why the tangential\r\nresistance to the comet of Encke should not also produce a retrograde\r\nmotion in the apsides of the orbit, instead of diminishing its period?\r\nTo the honor of Newton, be it remembered, that he never resorted to an\r\nexplanation of this phenomenon, which would vitiate that fundamental\r\nproposition of his theory, in which the major axis of the orbit is shown\r\nto depend on the velocity at any given distance from the focus.\r\n\r\nSome cause, however, exists to double the motion of the apogee, and\r\nthat there is an outstanding excess of orbital velocity due to the\r\ntangential force, is also true. This excess may tell in the way\r\nproposed, provided some other arrangement exists to _prevent_ a\r\npermanent dilation of the lunar orbit; and this provision may be found\r\nin the increasing density of the ether, which prevents the moon\r\noverstepping the bounds prescribed by her own density, and the force of\r\nthe radial stream of the terral vortex. In the case of Jupiter and\r\nSaturn, their mutual action is much less interfered with by change of\r\ndensity in the ether in the enlarged or contracted orbit, and,\r\nconsequently, the effect is natural. Thus, we have in the law of density\r\nof the ethereal medium a better safeguard to the stability of the\r\ndynamical balance of the system, than in the profound and beautiful\r\nTheorems of La Grange. It will, of course, occur to every one, that we\r\nare not to look for the same law in every vortex, and it will,\r\ntherefore, appear as if the satellites of Jupiter, whose theory is so\r\nwell known, should render apparent any deviation between their periodic\r\ntimes and the periodic times of the contiguous parts of the vortex,\r\nwhich would obtain, if the density of the ether in the Jovian vortex\r\nwere not as the square roots of the distances directly. But, we have\r\nshown how there can be a balance preserved, if the tangential resistance\r\nof the vortex shall be equal and contrary at the different distances at\r\nwhich the satellites are placed; that is, if these two forces shall\r\nfollow the same law. These are matters, however, for future\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT AND HEAT.\r\n\r\nBut will not the admission of a vorticose motion of the ethereal medium,\r\naffect the aberration of light? It is well known that the question has\r\nbeen mooted, whether the velocity of reflected light is the same as that\r\nof direct light. The value of aberration having been considered 20\".25,\r\nfrom the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, while later determinations,\r\nfrom observations on Polaris, give 20\".45. It cannot be doubted that\r\nlight, in traversing the central parts of the solar vortex, that is,\r\nhaving to cross the whole orbit of the earth, should pass this distance\r\nin a portion of time somewhat different to a similar distance outside\r\nthe earth's orbit, where the density is greater, and consequently induce\r\nan error in the aberration, determined by the eclipses of Jupiter's\r\nsatellites. In the case of Polaris, the circumstances are more equal;\r\nstill, a difference ought to be detected between the deduced aberration\r\nin summer and in winter, as, in the first case, the light passes near\r\nthe axis of the solar vortex, where (according to the theory) a change\r\nof density occurs. This is an important practical question, and the\r\nsuggestion is worthy attention. Now, the question occurs, will light\r\npass through the rarefied space with greater velocity than through the\r\ndenser ether beyond? From recent experiments, first instituted by Arago,\r\nit is determined that light passes with less velocity through water than\r\nthrough air; and one result of these experiments is the confirmation\r\nthey give to the theory of Fresnel, that the medium which conveys the\r\naction of light partly partakes of the motion of the refracting body.\r\nThis of itself is a strong confirmation of this theory of an ethereal\r\nmedium. It may also be remarked, that every test applied to the\r\nphenomenon of light, adds additional strength to the undulatory theory,\r\nat the expense of the Newtonian theory of emission. As light occupies\r\ntime in traversing space, it must follow from the theory that it does\r\nnot come from the radiant point exactly in straight lines, inasmuch as\r\nthe ether itself is in motion tangentially,--the velocity being in the\r\nsub-duplicate ratio of the distances from the sun inversely.\r\n\r\nMay not that singular phenomenon,--the projection of a star on the\r\nmoon's disc, at the time of an occultation,--be due to this curvature of\r\nthe path of a ray of light, by considering that the rays from the moon\r\nhave less intensity, but more mechanical momentum, and consequently\r\nmore power to keep a straight direction? Let us explain: we have urged\r\nthat light, as well as heat, is a mechanical effect of atomic motion,\r\npropagated through an elastic medium; that, _ceteris paribus_, the\r\nproduct of matter by its motion is ever a constant quantity for equal\r\nspaces throughout the universe,--in a word, that it is, and must\r\nnecessarily be, a fundamental law of nature. All departures from this\r\nlaw are consequences of accidental arrangements, which can only be\r\nconsidered of temporary duration. Our knowledge of planetary matter\r\nrequires the admission of differences in the density, form, and size of\r\nultimate atoms, and, according to the above law, when the atoms are of\r\nuniform temperature or motion, the product of the matter of each by its\r\nmotion, when reduced to the same space, will be constant. The momentum\r\nof two different atoms, therefore, we will consider equal, for the sake\r\nof illustration; yet this momentum is made up of two different\r\nelements,--matter and motion. Let us exaggerate the difference, and\r\nassign a ratio of 1000 to 1. Suppose a ball of iron of 1000 lbs.,\r\nresting upon a horizontal plane, should be struck by another ball of 1\r\nlb., having a motion of 1000 feet in a second, and, in a second case,\r\nshould be struck by a ball of 1000 lbs., having a velocity of 1 foot per\r\nsecond, the momentum of each ball is similar; but experience proves that\r\nthe motion impressed on the ball at rest is not similar; the ponderous\r\nweight and slow motion is far more effective in displacing this ball,\r\nfor the reason that time is essential to the distribution of the motion.\r\nIf the body to be struck be small as, for instance, a nail, a greater\r\nmotion and less matter is more effective than much matter and little\r\nmotion. Hence, we have a _distinction_ applicable to the difference of\r\nmomentum of luminous and calorific rays. The velocity of a wave of sound\r\nthrough the atmosphere, is the same for the deep-toned thunder and the\r\nshrillest whistle,--being dependent on the density of the medium, and\r\nnot on the source from which it emanates. So it is in the ethereal\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\nThis view is in accordance with the experiments of M. Delaroche and\r\nMelloni, on the transmission of light and heat through diaphanous\r\nbodies--the more calorific rays feeling more and more the influence of\r\nthickness, showing that more motion was imparted to the particles of the\r\ndiaphanous substance by the rays possessing more material momentum, and\r\nstill more when the temperature of the radiating body was low, evidently\r\nanalogous to the illustration we have cited. Light may therefore be\r\nregarded as the effect of the vibration of atoms having little mass, and\r\nas this mass increases, the rays become more calorific, and finally the\r\ncalorific effect is the only evidence of their existence; as towards the\r\nextreme red end of the spectrum they cease to be visible, owing to their\r\ninability to impart their vibrations to the optic nerve. This may also\r\ninfluence the law of gravitation. In this we have also an explanation of\r\nthe dispersion of light. The rays proceeding from atoms of small mass\r\nhaving less material momentum, are the most refrangible, and those\r\npossessing greater material momentum, are the least refrangible; so that\r\ninstead of presenting a difficulty in the undulatory theory of light,\r\nthis dispersion is a necessary consequence of its first principles.\r\n\r\nIt is inferred from the experiments cited, and the facts ascertained by\r\nthem, viz.: that the velocity of light in water is less than its\r\nvelocity in air; that the density of the ether is greater in the first\r\ncase; but this by no means follows. We have advocated the idea, that the\r\nethereal medium is less dense within a refracting body than without. We\r\nregard it as a fundamental principle. Taking the free ether of heaven;\r\nthe vibrations in the denser ether will no doubt be slowest; but within\r\na refracting body we must consider there is motion lost, or _light\r\nabsorbed_, and the time of the transmission is thus increased.\r\n\r\nThere has been a phenomenon observed in transits of Mercury and Venus\r\nacross the sun, of which no explanation has been rendered by\r\nastronomers. When these planets are visible on the solar disc, they are\r\nseen surrounded by rings, as if the light was intercepted and increased\r\nalternately. This is no doubt due to a small effect of interference,\r\ncaused by change of velocity in passing through the rarefied nucleus of\r\nthese planetary vortices, near the body of the planet, and through the\r\ndenser ether beyond, acting first as a concave, and secondly as a convex\r\nrefracting body; always considering that the ray will deviate _towards_\r\nthe side of least insistence, and thus interfere.\r\n\r\nThat heat is simply atomic motion, and altogether mechanical, is a\r\ndoctrine which ought never to have been questioned. The interest excited\r\nby the bold experiments of Ericson, has caused the scientific to\r\n_suspect_, that heat can be converted into motion, and motion into\r\nheat--a fact which the author has considered too palpable to deny for\r\nthe last twenty years. He has ever regarded matter and motion as the two\r\ngreat principles of nature, ever inseparable, yet variously combined;\r\nand that without these two elements, we could have no conception of\r\nanything existing.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought by some, who are afraid to follow truth up the rugged\r\nprecipices of the hill of knowledge, that this theory of an\r\ninterplanetary plenum leads to materialism; forgetting, that He who made\r\nthe world, formed it of matter, and pronounced it \"very good.\" We may\r\nconsider ethereal matter, in one sense, _purer_ than planetary matter,\r\nbecause unaffected by chemical laws. Whether still purer matter exists,\r\nit is not for us to aver or deny. The Scriptures teach us that \"there is\r\na natural body and there is a spiritual body.\" Beyond this we know\r\nnothing. We, however, believe that the _invisible_ world of matter, can\r\nonly be comprehended by the indications of that which is visible; yet\r\nwhile humbly endeavoring to connect by one common tie, the various\r\nphenomena of matter and motion, we protest against those doctrines which\r\nteach the eternal duration of the present order of things, as being\r\nincompatible with the analogies of the past, as well as with the\r\nrevelations of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] Silliman's Journal, vol xxxv., page 283.\r\n\r\n[36] The real diameter of the earth in that latitude, whose sine is\r\none-third, is a little greater than this; but the true mean is more\r\nfavorable for the Newtonian law.\r\n\r\n[37] This is, perhaps, the nearest ratio of the densities and distances.\r\n\r\n[38] This is an important consideration, as bearing on the geology of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n[39] It is not as likely that the condensation of the sun was so sudden\r\nas that of the planets, and therefore in this case this distance is only\r\napproximate.\r\n\r\n[40] Mechanique Celeste.

In the motions of comets we find no such agreement. These\r\nbodies move in planes at all possible inclinations in orbits extremely\r\neccentrical and without any general direction--as many moving contrary\r\nto the direction of the planets as in the opposite direction; and when\r\nwe consider their great volume, and their want of mass, it appears, at\r\nfirst sight, that comets do present a serious objection to the theory.\r\nWe shall point out, however, a number of _facts_ which tend to\r\ninvalidate this objection, and which will ultimately give the\r\npreponderance to the opposite argument.\r\n\r\nEvery fact indicative of the nature of comets proves that the nuclei are\r\nmasses of material gases, similar, perhaps (at least in the case of the\r\nshort-period comets), to the elementary gases of our own planet, and,\r\nconsequently, these masses must be but small. In the nascent state of\r\nthe system, the radial stream of the vortex would operate as a fan,\r\npurging the planetary materials of the least ponderable atoms, and, as\r\nit were, separating the wheat from the chaff. It is thus we conceive\r\nthat the average atomic density of each planet has been first determined\r\nby the radial stream, and, subsequently, that the solidification of the\r\nnebulous planets has, by their atomic density, assigned to each its\r\nposition in the system, from the consequent relation which it\r\nestablished between the density of the ether within the planet, and the\r\ndensity of the ether external to it, so that, according to this view, a\r\nsingle isolated atom of the same density as the mean atomic density of\r\nthe earth could (_ceteris paribus_) revolve in an orbit at the distance\r\nof the earth, and in the same periodic time. This, however, is only\r\nadvanced by way of illustration.\r\n\r\nThe expulsive force of the radial stream would thus drive off this\r\ncometary dust to distances in some inverse ratio of the density of the\r\natoms; but, a limit would ultimately be reached, when gravitation would\r\nbe relatively the strongest--the last force diminishing only as the\r\nsquares of the distances, and the first diminishing in the compound\r\nratio of the squares and the square roots of the distances. At the\r\nextreme verge of the system, this cometary matter would accumulate, and,\r\nby accumulation, would still further gather up the scattered atoms--the\r\nsweepings of the inner space--and, in this condensed form, would again\r\nvisit the sun in an extremely elongated ellipse. It does not, however,\r\nfollow, that all comets are composed of such unsubstantial materials.\r\nThere may be comets moving in parabolas, or even in hyperbolas--bodies\r\nwhich may have been accumulating for ages in the unknown regions of\r\nspace, far removed from the sun and stars, drifting on the mighty\r\ncurrents of the great ethereal ocean, and thus brought within the sphere\r\nof the sun's attraction; and these bodies may have no analogy to the\r\nperiodical comets of our system, which last are those with which we are\r\nmore immediately concerned.\r\n\r\nThe periodical comets known are clearly arranged into two distinct\r\nclasses--one having a mean distance between Saturn and Uranus, with a\r\nperiod of about seventy-five years, and another class, whose mean\r\ndistance assigns their position between the smaller planets and Jupiter,\r\nhaving periods of about six years. These last may be considered the\r\nsiftings of the smaller planets, and the first the refuse of the\r\nSaturnian system. In this light we may look for comets having a mean\r\ndistance corresponding to the intervals of the planets, rather than to\r\nthe distances of the planets themselves. One remarkable fact, however,\r\nto be observed in these bodies is, that all their motions are in the\r\nsame direction as the planets, and, with one exception, there is no\r\nperiodical comet positively known whose motion is retrograde.\r\n\r\nThe exception we have mentioned is the celebrated comet of Halley, whose\r\nperiod is also about seventy-five years. In reasoning on the resistance\r\nof the ether, we must consider that the case can have very little\r\nanalogy with the theory of projectiles in air; nor can we estimate the\r\ninertia of an infinitely divisible fluid, from its resisting influence\r\non atomic matter, by a comparison of the resistance of an atomic fluid\r\non an atomic solid. Analogy will only justify comparisons of like with\r\nlike. The tangent of a comet's orbit, also, can only be tangential to\r\nthe circular motion of the ether at and near perihelion, which is a very\r\nsmall portion of its period of revolution. As far as the tangential\r\nresistance is concerned, therefore, it matters little whether its motion\r\nbe direct or retrograde. If a retrograde comet, of short period and\r\nsmall eccentricity, were discovered moving also near the central plane\r\nof the vortex, it would present a very serious objection, as being\r\nindicative of contrary motions in the nascent state of the system. There\r\nis no such case known. So, also, with the inclinations of the orbits; if\r\nthese be great, it matters little whether the comet moves in one way or\r\nthe other, as far as the tangential current of the vortex is concerned.\r\nYet, when we consider the average inclination of the orbit, and not of\r\nits plane, we find that the major axes of nearly all known cometary\r\norbits are very little inclined to the plane of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nIn the following table of all the periodical comets known, the\r\ninclination of the major axis of the orbit is calculated to the nearest\r\ndegree; but all cometary orbits with very few exceptions, will be found\r\nto respect the ecliptic, and never to deviate far from that plane:\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |  Designations  | Periodic  | Inclination | Motion    | Planetary   |\r\n  | of the Comets. |  times.   |    of       | in Orbit. | Intervals.  |\r\n  |                |           | Major Axes  |           |             |\r\n  |--------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n  |Encke    | 1818 | 3 years.  |      1d     | Direct    |Mars & Ceres.|\r\n  |--------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n  |De Vico  | 1814 |           |      2      | Direct    |             |\r\n  |Fayo     | 1843 |           |      4      | Direct    |   Ceres     |\r\n  |De Avrest| 1851 |   From    |      1      | Direct    |             |\r\n  |Brorsen  | 1846 |   five    |      7      | Direct    |    and      |\r\n  |Messier  | 1766 |   to      |      0      | Direct    |             |\r\n  |Clausen  | 1743 |   six     |      0      | Direct    |  Jupiter.   |\r\n  |Pigott   | 1783 |   or      |      4      | Direct    |             |\r\n  |Pous     | 1819 |   seven   |      3      | Direct    |             |\r\n  |Biela    | 1826 |   years.  |      9      | Direct    |             |\r\n  |Blaupain | 1819 |           |      2      | Direct    |             |\r\n  |Lexell   | 1770 |           |      1      | Direct    |             |\r\n  |--------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n  |Pous     | 1812 |           |     17      | Direct    |             |\r\n  |Olbers   | 1816 |   about   |     40      | Direct    |  Saturn     |\r\n  |De Vico  | 1846 |   75      |     13      | Direct    |    and      |\r\n  |Brorsen  | 1847 |   years.  |     12      | Direct    |  Uranus.    |\r\n  |Westphal | 1852 |           |     21      | Direct    |             |\r\n  |Halley   | 1682 |           |     16      | Retrograde|             |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nFrom which it appears, that the objection arising from the great\r\ninclination of the _planes_ of these orbits is much less important than\r\nat first it appears to be.\r\n\r\nRegarding then, that a comet's mean distance depends on its mean atomic\r\ndensity, as in the case of the planets, the undue enlargement of their\r\norbits by planetary perturbations is inadmissible. In 1770 Messier\r\ndiscovered a comet which approached nearer the earth than any comet\r\nknown, and it was found to move in a small ellipse with a period of five\r\nand a half years; but although repeatedly sought for, it was the\r\nopinion of many, that it has never been since seen. The cause of this\r\nseeming anomaly is found by astronomers in the disturbing power of\r\nJupiter,--near which planet the comet must have passed in 1779, but the\r\ncomet was not seen in 1776 before it passed near Jupiter, although a\r\nvery close search was kept up about this time. Now there are two\r\nsuppositions in reference to this body: the comet either moved in a\r\nlarger orbit previous to 1767, and was then caused by Jupiter to\r\ndiminish its velocity sufficiently to give it a period of five and a\r\nhalf years, and that after perihelion it recovered a portion of its\r\nvelocity in endeavoring to get back into its natural orbit; or if moving\r\nin the natural orbit in 1770, and by passing near Jupiter in 1779 this\r\norbit was deranged, the comet will ultimately return to that mean\r\ndistance although not necessarily having elements even approximating\r\nthose of 1770. In 1844, September 15th, the author discovered a comet in\r\nthe constellation Cetus, (the same previously discovered by De Vico at\r\nHome,) and from positions _estimated with the naked eye_ approximately\r\ndetermined the form of its orbit and its periodic time to be very\r\nsimilar to the lost comet of 1770. These conclusions were published in a\r\nwestern paper in October 1844, on which occasion he expressed the\r\nconviction, that this was no other than the comet of 1770. As the\r\nquestion bore strongly on his theory he paid the greater attention to\r\nit, and had, previously to this time, often searched in hopes of finding\r\nthat very comet. Since then, M. Le Verrier has examined the question of\r\nidentity and given his decision against it; but the author is still\r\nsanguine that the comet of 1844 is the same as that of 1770, once more\r\nsettled at its natural distance from the sun. This comet returns to its\r\nperihelion on the 6th of August, 1855, according to Dr. Brunnow, when,\r\nit is hoped, the question of identity will be reconsidered with\r\nreference to the author's principles; and, that when astronomers become\r\nsatisfied of this, they will do him the justice of acknowledging that\r\nhe was the first who gave publicity to the fact, that the \"Lost Comet\"\r\nwas found.\r\n\r\nThat comets do experience a resistance, is undeniable; but not in the\r\nway astronomers suppose, if these views be correct. The investigations\r\nof Professor Encke, of Berlin, on the comet which bears his name, has\r\ndetermined the necessity of a correction, which has been applied for\r\nseveral returns with apparent success. But there is this peculiarity\r\nabout it, which adds strength to our theory: \"The Constant of\r\nResistance\" requires a change after perihelion. The necessity for this\r\nchange shows the action of the radial stream. From the law of this\r\nforce, (reckoning on the central plane of the vortex,) there is an\r\noutstanding portion, acting as a disturbing power, in the sub-duplicate\r\nratio of the distances inversely. If we only consider the mean or\r\naverage effect in orbits nearly circular, this force may be considered\r\nas an ablatitious force at all distances below the mean, counterbalanced\r\nby an opposite effect at all distances above the mean. But when the\r\norbits become very eccentrical, we must consider this force as\r\nmomentarily affecting a comet's velocity, diminishing it as it\r\napproaches the perihelion, and increasing it when leaving the\r\nperihelion. A resolution of this force is also requisite for the comet's\r\ndistance above the central plane of the vortex, and a correction,\r\nlikewise, for the intensity of the force estimated in that plane. There\r\nis also a correction necessary for the perihelion distance, and another\r\nfor the tangential current; but we are only considering here the general\r\neffect. By diminishing the comet's proper velocity in its orbit, if we\r\nconsider the attraction of the sun to remain the same, the general\r\neffect _may_ be (for this depends on the tangential portion of the\r\nresolved force preponderating) that the absolute velocity will be\r\nincreased, and the periodic time shortened; but after passing the\r\nperihelion, with the velocity of a smaller orbit, there is also\r\nsuperadded to this already undue velocity, the expulsive power of the\r\nradial stream, adding additional velocity to the comet; the orbit is\r\ntherefore enlarged, and the periodic time increased. Hence the necessity\r\nof changing the \"Constant of Resistance\" after perihelion, and this will\r\ngenerally be found necessary in all cometary orbits, if this theory be\r\ntrue. But this question is one which may be emphatically called the most\r\ndifficult of dynamical problems, and it may be long before it is fully\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nAccording to the calculations of Professor Encke, the comet's period is\r\naccelerated about 2 hours, 30 minutes, at each return, which he\r\nconsiders due to a resisting medium. May it not rather be owing to _the\r\nchange of inclination of the major axis of the orbit, to the central\r\nplane of the vortex_? Suppose the inclination of the _plane_ of the\r\norbit to remain unchanged, and the eccentricity of the orbit also, if\r\nthe longitude of the perihelion coincides with that of either node, the\r\nmajor axis of the orbit lies in the ecliptic, and the comet then\r\nexperiences the greatest mean effect from the radial stream; its mean\r\ndistance is then, _ceteris paribus_, the greatest. When the angle\r\nbetween the perihelion and the nearest node increases, the mean force of\r\nthe radial stream is diminished, and the mean distance is diminished\r\nalso. When the angle is 90d, the effect is least, and the mean distance\r\nleast. This is supposing the ecliptic the central plane of the vortex.\r\nWhen Encke's formula was applied to Biela's comet, it was inadequate to\r\naccount for a tenth part of the acceleration; and although Biela moves\r\nin a much denser medium, and is of less dense materials, even this taken\r\ninto account will not satisfy the observations,--making no other change\r\nin Encke's formula. We must therefore attribute it to changes in the\r\nelements of the orbits of these comets. Now, the effect of resistance\r\nshould also have been noticed, as an acceleration of Halley's comet in\r\n1835, yet the period was prolonged. To show, that our theory of the\r\n_cause_ of these anomalies corresponds with facts, we subjoin the\r\nelements in the following tables, taken from Mr. Hind's catalogue:\r\n\r\nTHE ELEMENTS OF ENCKE'S COMET.\r\n\r\n   Date of     Longitude of   Longitude of   Difference of\r\n  Perihelion.

Halley's comet can scarcely be considered\r\nto have had an orbit with perfect elements before 1835. If they were\r\nknown accurately for 1759, we should no doubt find, that the angle\r\nbetween the node and perihelion _diminished_ in the interval between\r\n1750 and 1835, as according to the calculations of M. Rosenberg, the\r\ncomet was six days behind its time--a fact fatal to the common ideas of\r\na resisting medium; but this amount of error must be received as only\r\napproximate.\r\n\r\nNo comet that has revisited the sun, has given astronomers more trouble\r\nthan the great comet of 1843. Various orbits have been tried,\r\nelliptical, parabolic and hyperbolic; yet none will accord with all the\r\nobservations. The day before this comet was seen in Europe and the\r\nUnited States, it was seen close to the body of the sun at Conception,\r\nin South America; yet this observation, combined with those following,\r\nwould give an orbital velocity due to a very moderate mean distance.\r\nSubsequent observations best accorded with a hyperbolic orbit; and it\r\nwas in view of this anomaly, that the late Sears C. Walker considered\r\nthat the comet came into collision with the sun in an elliptical orbit,\r\nand its _debris_ passed off again in a hyperbola. That a concussion\r\nwould not add to its velocity is certain, and the departure in a\r\nhyperbolic orbit would be contrary to the law of gravitation. This\r\nprinciple is thus stated by Newton:--\"In parabola velocitas ubiquo\r\nequalis est velocitati corporis revolventis in circulo ad dimidiam\r\ndistantiam; in ellipsi minor est in hyperbola major.\" (Vid. Prin. Lib.\r\n1. Prop. 6 Cor. 7.)\r\n\r\nBut as regards the _fact_, it is probable that Mr. Walker's views are\r\ncorrect, so far as the change from an ellipse to an hyperbola is\r\nconsidered. The Conception observation cannot be summarily set aside,\r\nand Professor Peirce acknowledges, that \"If it was made with anything of\r\nthe accuracy which might be expected from Captain Ray, it exhibits a\r\ndecided anomaly in the nature of the forces to which the comet was\r\nsubjected during its perihelion passage.\" The comet came up to the sun\r\nalmost in a straight line against the full force of the radial stream;\r\nits velocity must therefore necessarily have been diminished. After its\r\nperihelion, its path was directly _from_ the sun, and an undue velocity\r\nwould be kept up by the auxiliary force impressed upon it by the same\r\nradial stream; and hence, the later observations give orbits much larger\r\nthan the early ones, and there can be no chance of identifying this\r\ncomet with any of its former appearances, even should its orbit be\r\nelliptical. This unexpected confirmation of the theory by the\r\nobservation of Capt. Ray, cannot easily be surmounted.\r\n\r\nWe must now endeavor to explain the physical peculiarities of comets, in\r\naccordance with the principles laid down. The most prominent phenomenon\r\nof this class is the change of diameter of the visible nebulosity. It is\r\na most singular circumstance, but well established as a fact, that a\r\ncomet contracts in its dimensions on approaching the sun, and expands on\r\nleaving it. In 1829, accurate measures were taken on different days, of\r\nthe diameter of Encke's comet, and again in 1838. The comet of 1618 was\r\nalso observed by Kepler with this very object, and also the comet of\r\n1807; but without multiplying instances, it may be asserted that it is\r\none of those facts in cometary phenomena, to which there are no\r\nexceptions. According to all analogy, the very reverse of this ought to\r\nobtain. If a comet is chiefly vaporous, (as this change of volume would\r\nseem to indicate,) its approach to the sun ought to be attended by a\r\ncorresponding expansion by increase of temperature. When the contrary is\r\nobserved, and invariably so, it ought to be regarded as an index of the\r\nexistence of other forces besides gravitation, increasing rapidly in the\r\nneighborhood of the sun; for the disturbing power of the sun's\r\nattraction would be to enlarge the diameter of a comet in proportion to\r\nits proximity. Now, the force of the radial stream, as we have shown, is\r\nas the 2.5th power of the distances inversely. If this alternate\r\ncontraction and expansion be due to the action of this force, there\r\nought to be an approximate correspondence of the law of the effect with\r\nthe law of the cause. Arago, in speaking of the comet of 1829, states,\r\n\"that between the 28th of October and the 24th of December, the volume\r\nof the comet was reduced as 16000 to 1, the change of distance in the\r\nmeantime only varying about 3 to 1.\" To account for this, a memoir was\r\npublished on the subject by M. Valz, in which he supposes an atmosphere\r\naround the sun, whose condensation increases rapidly from superincumbent\r\npressure; so that the deeper the comet penetrates into this atmosphere\r\nthe greater will be the pressure, and the less the volume. In this it is\r\nevident, that the ponderous nature of a resisting medium is not yet\r\nbanished from the schools. In commenting on this memoir, Arago justly\r\nobserves, that \"there would be no difficulty in this if it could be\r\nadmitted that the exterior envelope of the nebulosity were not permeable\r\nto the ether; but this difficulty seems insurmountable, and merits our\r\nsincere regret; for M. Valz's ingenious hypothesis has laid down the law\r\nof variation of the bulk of the nebulosity, as well for the short-period\r\ncomet as for that of 1618, with a truly wonderful exactness.\" Now, if we\r\nmake the calculation, we shall find that the diameter of the nebulosity\r\nof a comet is inversely as the force of the radial stream. This force is\r\ninversely as the 2.5 power of the distances from the axis, and not from\r\nthe sun: it will, therefore, be in the inverse ratio of the cosine of\r\nthe comet's heliocentric latitude to radius, and to this ratio the\r\ncomet's distance ought to be reduced. But, this will only be correct for\r\nthe same plane or for equal distances above the ecliptic plane,\r\nconsidering this last as approximately the central plane of the vortex.\r\nFrom the principles already advanced, the radial stream is far more\r\npowerful on the central plane than in more remote planes; therefore, if\r\na comet, by increase of latitude, approaches near the axis, thus\r\nreceiving a larger amount of force from the radial stream in that plane\r\nthan pertains to its actual distance from the sun, it will also receive\r\na less amount of force in that plane than it would in the central plane\r\nat the same distance from the axis. Now, we do not know the difference\r\nof force at different elevations above the central plane of the vortex;\r\nbut as the two differences due to elevation are contrary in their\r\neffects and tend to neutralize each other, we shall make the calculation\r\nas if the distances were truly reckoned from the centre of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe following table is extracted from Arago's tract on Comets, and\r\nrepresents the variations of the diameter of Encke's comet at different\r\ndistances from the sun,--the radius of the orbis magnus being taken as\r\nunity.\r\n\r\n  Times of observation,   Distances of the        Real diameters\r\n          1828.          comet from the sun.  in radii of the earth.\r\n       Oct. 28                1.4617                 79.4\r\n       Nov.  7                1.3217                 64.8\r\n       Nov. 30                0.9668                 29.8\r\n       Dec.  7                0.8473                 19.9\r\n       Dec. 14                0.7285                 11.3\r\n       Dec. 24                0.6419                  3.1\r\n\r\nIn order the better to compare the diameters with the force, we will\r\nreduce them by making the first numbers equal.\r\n\r\n  Distances.

Our\r\nprincipal aim is to pioneer the way into the labyrinth, and it is\r\nsufficient to connect this seeming anomaly with the same general law we\r\nhave deduced from other phenomena. Still, an explanation may be given in\r\nstrict accordance with the general principles of the theory.\r\n\r\nAdmitting the _nucleus_ of a comet to be gaseous, there is no difficulty\r\nabout the solution. According to Sir John Herschel, \"stars of the\r\nsmallest magnitude remain distinctly visible, though covered by what\r\nappears the densest portion of their substances; and since it is an\r\nobserved fact, that the large comets which have presented the appearance\r\nof a nucleus, have yet exhibited no phases, though we cannot doubt that\r\nthey shine by the reflected solar light, it follows that even these can\r\nonly be regarded as great masses of thin vapor.\" That comets shine\r\nsolely by reflected solar light, is a position that we shall presently\r\nquestion; but that they are masses of vapor is too evident to dispute.\r\nAccording to the same authority quoted above, \"If the earth were reduced\r\nto the one thousandth part of its actual mass, its coercive power over\r\nthe atmosphere would be diminished in the same proportion, and in\r\nconsequence the latter would expand to a thousand times its actual\r\n_bulk_.\" If this were so, and comets composed of the elementary gases,\r\nsome of them would have very respectable masses, as the nuclei are\r\nfrequently not more than 5,000 miles in diameter, and consequently it\r\nbecomes important to examine the principle. From all experiments the\r\ndensity of an elastic fluid is directly as the compressing force; and if\r\na cylinder reached to the top of our atmosphere, compressed by the\r\ngravitation of the earth, considered equal at each end of the cylinder,\r\nit would represent the actual compressing force to which it owes its\r\ndensity. If the gravitation of the earth were diminished one thousand\r\ntimes this atmospheric column would expand one thousand times,[44]\r\n(taking no account of the decrease of gravitation by increase of\r\ndistance;) so that the diameter of the aerial globe would be increased\r\nto 108,000 miles, taking the atmosphere at 50 miles. But the mere\r\nincreasing the _bulk_ of the atmosphere 1000 times would increase the\r\ndiameter to little more than double. Even giving the correct expansion,\r\na comet's mass must be much greater than is generally supposed, or the\r\ndiameters of the nuclei would be greater if composed of any gas lighter\r\nthan atmospheric air.\r\n\r\nIt is very improbable that a comet is composed of only one elementary\r\ngas, and if of many, their specific gravities will vary; the lighter, of\r\ncourse, occupying the exterior layers. With such a small mass,\r\ntherefore, the upper portion of its atmosphere must be very attenuated.\r\nNow let us remember that the density of the ether at a comet's aphelion,\r\nis greater than at the perihelion, in the direct ratio of the square\r\nroots of the distances from the sun nearly. At the aphelion the comet\r\nlingers through half his period, giving ample time for the nucleus to be\r\npermeated by ether proportionally dense with the surrounding ether of\r\nthe vortex at that distance. Thus situated, the comet descends to its\r\nperihelion, getting faster and faster into a medium far less dense, and\r\nthere must consequently be an escape from the nucleus, or in common\r\nparlance, the comet is positively electric. This escaping ether, in\r\npassing through the attenuated layers composing the surface of the\r\nnucleus, impels the lighter atoms of cometic dust further from the\r\ncentre, and as for as this _doubly_ attenuated atmosphere of isolated\r\nparticles extends, so far will the escaping ether be rendered luminous.\r\nIt may be objected here, that a contrary effect ought to be produced\r\nwhen the comet is forsaking, its perihelion; but the objection is\r\npremature, as the heat received from the sun will have the same effect\r\nin increasing the elasticity, as change of density, and the comet will\r\nprobably part with its internal ether as long as it is visible to the\r\nearth; and not fully regain it perhaps, until after it arrives at its\r\naphelion. Suppose that we admit that a comet continues to expand in the\r\nsame ratio for all distances, as is laid down for the comet of Encke\r\nwhen near its perihelion; it would follow, that the comet of 1811, would\r\nhave a diameter at its aphelion of fifty millions of millions of miles,\r\nthat is, its outside would extend one thousand times further from the\r\nsun, at the opposite side to that occupied by the centre of the comet,\r\nthan the distance of the comet's centre from the sun, at its enormous\r\naphelion distance. Such an absurdity shows us that there is a limit of\r\nexpansion due to natural causes, and that if there were no radial stream\r\nthe volume of a comet would be greatest when nearest the sun.\r\n\r\nBut while the comet is shortening its distance and hastening to the sun\r\nin the form of a huge globular mass of diffuse light, it is continually\r\nencountering another force, increasing in a far more rapid ratio than\r\nthe law of gravitation. At great distances from the sun, the force of\r\nthe radial stream was insufficient to detach any portion of the comet's\r\natmosphere; presently, however, the globular form is changed to an\r\nellipsoid, the radial stream begins to strip the comet of that doubly\r\nattenuated atmosphere of which we have spoken, and the diameter of the\r\ncomet is diminished, merely because the luminosity of the escaping ether\r\nis terminated at the limit of that atmosphere. Meanwhile the mass of the\r\ncomet has suffered only an infinitely small diminution; but if the\r\nperihelion distance be small, the force may become powerful enough to\r\ndetach the heavier particles of the nucleus, and thus a comet may suffer\r\nin mass by this denudating process. We regard, therefore, the nucleus of\r\na comet to represent the mass of the comet and the coma, as auroral rays\r\npassing through a very attenuated envelope of detached particles. The\r\nindividual gravitating force of these particles to the comet's centre,\r\nmay be therefore considered as inversely as the squares of the\r\ndistances, and directly as the density of the particles; and this\r\ndensity will, according to analogical reasoning, be as the distances or\r\nsquare roots of the distances;--grant the last ratio, and the\r\ngravitating force of the particles composing the exterior envelope of a\r\ncomet, becomes inversely as the 2.5th power of the distances from the\r\ncomet's centre.[45] This being the law of the radial stream, it follows,\r\nof course, that a comet's diameter is inversely as the force of the\r\nradial stream. It must, however, be borne in mind, that we are speaking\r\nof the atomic density, and not of density by compression; for this\r\ncometary dust, which renders luminous the escaping ether of the nucleus,\r\nmust be far too much diffused to merit the name of an elastic fluid. May\r\nnot the concentric rings, which were so conspicuous in the comet of\r\n1811, be owing to differences in the gravitating forces of such\r\nparticles, sifted, as it were, and thus arranged, according to some\r\nratio of the distances, by the centripulsive force of the electric coma,\r\nleaving vacant intervals, through which the ether passed without\r\nbecoming luminous? This at least is the explanation given by our theory.\r\nWe may, indeed, consider it possible that the escaping ether, when very\r\nintense, might be rendered luminous by passing into the surrounding\r\nether, and, as it became more diffused by radiation, at last become\r\ninvisible. In this case, as the law of radiation is as the squares of\r\nthe distances from the centre inversely, the rays would be more and more\r\nbent at right angles, or apparently shortened, as the power of the\r\nradial stream increased, and the apparent diameters of the coma would\r\nbe diminished faster than the ratio of the 2.5th power of the distances.\r\nBut whichever view we adopt, the diameter would again increase in the\r\nsame ratio on leaving the sun, if we make allowance for increase of\r\ntemperature, as well as for diminution of density, for the ordinary\r\ndistance of a comet's visibility. We, however, regard the change of\r\ndiameter, as due to both these nodes of action, as best agreeing with\r\nthe indications afforded by their tails.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding remarks, it results that the density of the particles\r\nproducing the nebulous envelope of a comet, renders the variations of\r\ndiameter only approximate to the law of the radial stream; a comet's own\r\nelectric energy, or the intensity of the escaping ether, may also modify\r\nthis expression, and many other causes may be suggested. That the radial\r\nstream is the cause, in the way we have pointed out, is proved by the\r\npositions of the major axis of the short-period comet, making frequently\r\nnearly a right angle with the radius vector of the orbit in 1828. A soap\r\nbubble gently blown aside, without detaching it from the pipe, will\r\nafford a good illustration of the mode, and a confirmation of the cause.\r\nThe angles measured by Struve, reckoned from the radius vector,\r\nprolonged towards the sun, are subjoined:\r\n\r\n  November 7        99d.7  |  December 7       154d.0\r\n  November 30      145 .3  |  December 14      149 .4\r\n\r\nAt this last date, the comet was getting pretty close to the sun. When\r\nthe angle was greater, as on November 7th, the comet appeared to make\r\nalmost a right angle with the radius vector; and in this position of the\r\nearth and comet, the longer axis of the elliptical comet was directed to\r\nthe axis of the vortex, as may be verified by experiment. At the later\r\ndates, the comet was more rapidly descending, and, at the same time, the\r\naxis of the comet was getting more directed towards the earth; so that\r\nthe angle increased between this axis and the radius vector, and\r\nconsequently became more coincident with it. We have now to consider the\r\nluminous appendage of a comet, commonly called a tail.\r\n\r\nThe various theories hitherto proposed to account for this appendage are\r\nliable to grave objections. That it is not refracted light needs not a\r\nword of comment. Newton supposes the tail to partake of the nature of\r\nvapor, rising from the sun by its extreme levity, as smoke in a chimney,\r\nand rendered visible by the reflected light of the sun. But, how vapor\r\nshould rise towards opposition in a vacuum, is utterly inexplicable. In\r\nspeaking of the greater number of comets near the sun than on the\r\nopposite side, he observes: \"Hinc etiam manifestum est quod coeli\r\nresistentia destituuntur.\"[46] And again, in another place, speaking of\r\nthe tail moving with the same velocity of the comet, he says: \"Et hinc\r\nrursus colligitur spatia coelestia vi resistendi destitui; utpote in\r\nquibus non solum solida planetarum et cometarum corpora, sed etiam\r\nrarissimi candarum vapores motus suos velocissimos liberrime peragunt ac\r\ndiutissime conservant.\" On what _principle_, therefore, Newton relied to\r\ncause the vapors to ascend, does not appear. Hydrogen rises in our\r\natmosphere because specifically lighter. If there were no atmosphere,\r\nhydrogen would not rise, but merely expand on all sides. But, a comet's\r\ntail shoots off into space in a straight line of one hundred millions of\r\nmiles, and frequently as much as ten millions of miles in a single day,\r\nas in the case of the comet of 1843. Sir John Herschel observes, that\r\n\"no rational or even plausible account has yet been rendered of those\r\nimmensely luminous appendages which they bear about with them, and which\r\nare known as their tails.\" Yet, he believes, and astronomers generally\r\nbelieve, that a comet shines by reflected light. This theory of\r\nreflexion is the incubus which clogs the question with such formidable\r\ndifficulties; for, it follows, that the reflecting matter must come\r\nfrom the comet. But, what wonderful elements must a comet be made of, to\r\nproject themselves into space with such immense velocity, and in such\r\nenormous quantities as to exceed in volume the body from which they\r\nemanate many millions of times. This theory may be, therefore, safely\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have already advanced concerning the coma or nebulosity of\r\nthe comet, we pass by an easy path to an explanation of the tail. In the\r\nshort-period comets, the density of the elementary atoms is too great to\r\nbe detached in the gross from the nucleus, or, rather, the density of\r\nthe atoms composing the nucleus is too great to permit the radiating\r\nstream of the comet carrying them to a sufficient distance to be\r\ndetached by the radial stream of the sun. Hence, these comets exhibit\r\nbut very little tails. We may also conceive, that the continual siftings\r\nwhich the nucleus undergoes at each successive perihelion passage, have\r\nleft but little of those lighter elements in comets whose mean distances\r\nare so small. Yet, again, if by any chance the eccentricity is\r\nincreased, there are two causes--the density of the ether, and the heat\r\nof the sun--which may make a comet assume quite an imposing appearance\r\nwhen apparently reduced to the comparatively passive state above\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nAccording to our theory, then, the coma of a comet is due to the\r\nelasticity of the ethereal medium within the nucleus, caused both by the\r\ndiminished pressure of the external ether near the sun, and also by the\r\nincreased temperature acting on the nucleus, and thus on the involved\r\nether. The tail, on the contrary, is caused by the lighter particles of\r\nthe comet's attenuated atmosphere being blown off by the electric blast\r\nof the radial stream of the solar vortex, in sufficient quantities to\r\nrender its passage visible. It is not, therefore, reflected light, but\r\nan ethereal stream rendered luminous by this detached matter still held\r\nin check by the gravitating force of the sun, whose centre each\r\nparticle still respects, and endeavors to describe such an orbit as\r\nresults from its own atomic density, and the resultant action of both\r\nthe acting forces. From the law of density of the ether, the coma ought\r\nto be brightest and the radiating stream of the comet's nucleus\r\nstrongest on the side of least pressure: from this cause, and the fact\r\nthat the body of the comet affords a certain protection to the particles\r\nimmediately behind it, there will be an interval between the comet and\r\nthe tail less luminous, as is almost invariably observed. We thus have\r\nan explanation of the fact noticed by Sir John Herschel, \"that the\r\nstructure of a comet, as seen in section in the direction of its length,\r\nmust be that of a hollow envelope of a parabolic form, enclosing near\r\nits vertex the nucleus or head.\" We have, also, a satisfactory\r\nexplanation of the rapid formation of the tail; of its being wider and\r\nfainter at its extremity; of its occasional curvature; and of its\r\ngreater length after perihelion than before. But, more especially may we\r\npoint to the explanation which this theory gives of the fact, that,\r\n_ceteris paribus_, the long-period comets, when their perihelion\r\ndistances are small, have tails of such exaggerated dimensions.\r\n\r\nA comet, whose mean distance is considerable, is supposed by the theory\r\nto be composed of elements less dense, and, during its long sojourn at\r\nits aphelion, it may be also supposed that it there receives continual\r\naccessions to its volume from the diffused siftings of the system, and\r\nfrom the scattered debris of other comets. On approaching the\r\nperihelion, the rapidity of the change in the density of the ether in a\r\ngiven time, depends on the eccentricity of the orbit, and so does the\r\nchange of temperature; so that, from both causes, both the length of the\r\ntail and the brilliancy of the comet measurably depends on the magnitude\r\nof the period and of the eccentricity.\r\n\r\nIf the nuclei of comets be gaseous as we suppose, and that the smallest\r\nstars are visible through them, it is an outrage on common sense, to\r\nrefer that light, which renders a comet visible at noon-day, within six\r\nminutes of space of the sun itself, to the reflected light of the sun.\r\nWhen a small star has been seen through the nucleus of a comet, without\r\nany perceptible diminution of light, it indicates perfect transparency;\r\nbut there can be no reflection from a perfectly transparent body, and\r\ntherefore, a comet does not shine by reflected light. It is true that\r\nArago discovered traces of polarized light in the comet of 1819, and\r\nalso in more recent comets, but they are mere traces, and Arago himself\r\nadmits, that they do not permit \"the conclusion decidedly that these\r\nstars shine only with a borrowed light.\" But it still does not follow\r\nthat a comet (even if independent of reflected light) is in an\r\nincandescent state. The auroral light is not polarized, nor any other\r\nelectric light, neither is it owing to a state of incandescence, yet it\r\nis luminous. The intense light of a comet at perihelion is analogous to\r\nthe charcoal points of a galvanic battery, caused by a rapid current of\r\nether from the nucleus, and assisted by the radial stream of the vortex.\r\nThis will account for the phenomenon in all its shades of intensity, as\r\nwell as for the absence of any perceptible phase. It will also account\r\nfor the non-combustion of such comets as those of the years 1680 and\r\n1843. We shall also be at no loss to understand, why there is no\r\nrefraction when a ray of light from a star passes through the nebulosity\r\nof a comet; and if, as we may reasonably suppose, the gaseous matter\r\ncomposing the nucleus be very attenuated, instruments are yet too\r\nimperfect to determine whether these also have any refracting power. On\r\nthis point, however, it is safest to suspend our judgment, as there may\r\nbe comets not belonging to our system, with even liquid or solid nuclei,\r\nor of matter widely different to those elements composing the members of\r\nthe solar system.\r\n\r\nIn addition to what has been already advanced on this subject of a\r\ncomet's light, we may appeal to the well-known fact that the visibility\r\nof a comet is not reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the\r\nearth and sun as it ought to be, if shining by reflected light. In\r\nMr. Hind's late work on comets, the fact is stated that \"Dr. Olbers\r\nfound that the comet of 1780 attained its greatest brightness on the 8th\r\nof November, thirteen days subsequent to its discovery, whereas\r\naccording to the law of reflected light, it should have become gradually\r\nfainter from the day of its discovery; and supposing the comet\r\nself-luminous, the intensity of light should have increased each day\r\nuntil November 26th; yet in the interval between the 8th and 26th of\r\nthat month, it grew rapidly less.\" Now this theory teaches, that a comet\r\nis neither self-luminous nor dependent on the sun, but on its distance\r\nfrom the axis of the vortex, and a certain amount of elapsed time from\r\nthe perihelion, varying somewhat in each particular case. This fact is\r\ntherefore a very strong argument in favor of our theory.\r\n\r\nAmidst the many anomalous peculiarities of comets, it has been noticed\r\nthat a short tail is sometimes seen at right angles to the principal\r\ntail, and in a few cases pointing directly towards the sun. Much of this\r\nmay be owing to perspective, but granting the reality of the fact, it is\r\nstill explicable on the same general principles.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the modifying causes which influence the weather, we\r\nmentioned the effect due to the position of the sun with respect to the\r\naxis of the vortex. This will be found to have a sensible effect on the\r\naction of the radial stream. The natural direction of a comet's electric\r\nstream is _towards_ the axis of the vortex, and in the central plane of\r\nthe vortex it will be also towards the sun. But this stream is met by\r\nthe stronger radial stream from the axis, and as Mr. Hind describes it,\r\n\"is driven _backward_ in two streams passing on either side of the head,\r\nand ultimately blending into one to form the tail.\" Now, if the body of\r\nthe sun be situated between the comet and the axis of the vortex, it\r\nwill shield the comet from the action of the radial stream, and thus a\r\ntail may really point towards the sun.\r\n\r\nIn 1744 a brilliant comet exhibited six distinct tails spread out like a\r\nfan, some seven days after its perihelion passage; its distance from\r\nthe sun at the time not being more than a third of the earth's distance.\r\nThe comet was then rapidly approaching the plane of the ecliptic, and if\r\nwe make the calculation for the position of the sun, we shall find that\r\nthe body of the sun was on the same side of the axis of the vortex as\r\nthe comet, and that the comet was then situated at the boundaries of the\r\nconical space, enclosed by the radial stream in its deflected passage\r\nround the body of the sun. In this position there are numerous cross\r\ncurrents of the stream, and hence the phenomenon in question. As this\r\nfact rests on the testimony of one individual, and is an occurrence\r\nnever recorded before or since, many are disposed to doubt the fact, yet\r\nour theory explains even this peculiarity, and shows that there is no\r\nnecessity for impugning the statement of Cheseaux.\r\n\r\nAnother unexplained phenomenon is the corruscation of the tail. It has\r\nbeen attempted to explode this fact also, by referring it to conditions\r\nof our own atmosphere; and it is generally considered the argument of\r\nOlbers, founded on the great length of the tail and the velocity of\r\nlight, is sufficient to prove that these corruscations are not actually\r\nin the tail. Now, it is undoubtedly true, that as light travels less\r\nthan two hundred thousand miles in a second, and a comet's tail is\r\nfrequently one hundred millions long, it is impossible to see an\r\ninstantaneous motion along the whole line of the tail; but granting that\r\nthere are such flickerings in the tail as are described by so many, it\r\nmust necessarily be, that these flickerings will be _visible_. It would\r\nbe wonderful indeed, if a series of waves passing from the comet to the\r\nextremity of the tail, should have their phases so exactly harmonizing\r\nwith their respective distances as to produce a uniform steady light\r\nfrom a light in rapid motion. The argument, therefore, proves too much,\r\nand as it is in the very nature of electric light thus to corruscate, as\r\nwe see frequently in the northern lights, we must be permitted still to\r\nbelieve that not only the tails, but also the heads of comets do really\r\ncorruscate as described.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the direction of the tail, astronomers have been forced\r\nto abandon the antiquated notion, that the tail always pointed directly\r\nfrom the sun; yet they still pertinaciously cling to the idea, that\r\nalthough this is not always the case, the tail only deviates from this\r\ndirection _in the plane of the orbit_. As this is a most important\r\nquestion, it is necessary formally to protest against such a conclusion.\r\nIf the earth should happen to be in the plane of the comet's orbit and\r\nthe tail appears in that plane, it must of course be in that plane\r\n_really_; but if the earth is not in the plane of the comet's orbit, the\r\ntail is not _necessarily_ in the same plane, whatever its apparent\r\ndirection may indicate. It is true there is a tendency of every particle\r\nof the tail, moving under the restraining influence of the sun's\r\nattraction, to continue in the plane of the orbit; and in certain\r\npositions there is no oblique action arising from the force of the\r\nradial stream to cause it to deviate from that plane; yet in other\r\npositions of the comet, the action of the radial stream may be oblique,\r\nforcing it out of that plane, and still such a direction might be\r\nassigned to it as to make it conform. In the comet of 1843, P. Smythe\r\nobserved a forked tail 25d long on March 3d, and from the end of the\r\nforked tail, and from its _north_ side, a streamer diverged at an angle\r\nof 6d or 7d to the _north_. As this was contrary to the _direction_ of\r\nthe curvature, if the tail had been curved, it could only arise from a\r\nportion being driven off by the radial stream, or bent towards the plane\r\nof the ecliptic. The curvature observed by others at a later date, was\r\nconcave to the south. Towards the middle and close of March, the tail\r\nbecame straight, and with the above exception, might be considered to\r\nmove in the plane of the orbit.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated comet of Halley, as observed by Dr. Bessel in 1835,\r\nshowed that a more or less well-defined tuft of rays emanated from that\r\npart of the nucleus which was turned towards the sun; and the rays being\r\n_bent backward_ formed a part of the tail. The nucleus, with its\r\nemanations, presented the appearance of a burning rocket, the end of\r\nwhich was turned sideways by the force of the wind. And, Bessel\r\nconcludes: \"That the cone of light issuing from the comet deviated\r\nconsiderably both to the right and left of the true direction of the\r\nsun, but that it always returned to that direction, and passed over to\r\nthe opposite side; so that the cone of light, and the body of the comet\r\nfrom whence it emanated, experienced a rotatory, or, rather, a vibrating\r\nmotion _in the plane of the orbit_.\" It is impossible that Bessel should\r\nhere mean that this motion was certainly in the plane of the orbit; for\r\nthe orbit was then viewed sideways, and he had no means of ascertaining\r\nthe fact. His meaning must be that it was apparently in the plane of the\r\norbit. If a plane be made to pass through the earth, the comet, and the\r\nsun, the tail might be placed in any position in that plane, and yet\r\nappear to be at the intersection of the two; that is, in the plane of\r\nthe comet's orbit. The vibration of the tail, in this case, is another\r\nstrong proof of the correctness of our theory. To make it more\r\nintelligible, we shall resort to a diagram.\r\n\r\nIn the following diagram, the comet's orbit, represented by the dotted\r\nline, is drawn on the plane of the ecliptic; it is, therefore, necessary\r\nto bear in mind, that it is tilted up from the line of nodes SN, at an\r\nangle of 17d 45'. The position of the comet, October 9th, is at C,\r\napproaching its perihelion; that of the earth at the same time at T;\r\nwhile S represents the sun, and SQ the line of equinoxes. Now, from a\r\ncause already explained, the tail always tends to lay behind the comet,\r\nin the direction indicated by the lower tail in the diagram at 1, and,\r\nif produced, would pass to the left of the sun, as seen from the earth:\r\nthe force of the radial stream, however, will not allow this lagging of\r\nthe tail, and it is straightened out by this force; but, being directed\r\nto the axis of the vortex, and not to the sun, it is not really in the\r\nplane of the orbit, but is seen in the direction of the upper tail\r\ndepicted in the diagram at 3, and, if produced, would pass to the right\r\nof the sun, as seen from T. Now, there is an intermediate position of\r\nthe tail, in which it will appear in the prolongation of the radius\r\nvector SC; this position is represented by the middle or central tail of\r\nthe comet at 2, yet this is not in the plane of the orbit, it only\r\nappears to be, as may be readily understood by remembering that the\r\nearth at this time is under this plane, and the comet is seen at a\r\nconsiderable elevation above the plane of the ecliptic. When the comet's\r\ntail becomes directed to the axis of the vortex, or in the _apparent_\r\nposition of No. 3, the comet, rapidly careering on its way to the sun,\r\nagain leaves the tail behind, and again it is strengthened out by the\r\nradial stream oscillating about the mean position at 2, as observed by\r\nBessel. From this, it appears, that there is no necessity to make\r\nconfusion worse confounded, by resorting to polar forces, which are\r\nabout as intelligible as the foundations of the pillars of Atlas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25]\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that the continued action of the radial stream with\r\nthat velocity we have contended for, ought to keep the tail invariably\r\ndirected from the axis of the vortex; but, where there are two forces or\r\ntendencies, as in this case, analogy would teach us that a certain\r\ndegree of oscillation is a necessary result. There may, also, be slight\r\nand transient changes in the direction of the radial stream. In the\r\nhurricane there are short and fitful blasts inclined to the general\r\ndirection of the wind, which must arise from the inertia of the moving\r\nmass of atmosphere, causing temporary condensations and rarefactions. Be\r\nthis as it may, we have assigned a cause which satisfies the phenomenon,\r\nwithout coming into collision with a single principle of celestial\r\nmechanics.\r\n\r\nProf. Struve compared the tail of this comet to a flame, or \"ray of fire\r\nshot out from the nucleus, as from some engine of artillery, and driven\r\non one side by the wind.\" At the same time, he saw a second emanation\r\nnearly in the opposite direction. This last might arise from a momentary\r\nfluctuation in the relative intensities of the electric radiation of the\r\ncomet, and of the radial stream, owing to the probable irregularities\r\njust alluded to. Such and kindred phenomena are utterly inexplicable,\r\nwithout we adopt the theory we are advocating. One other feature, and we\r\nwill leave the subject.\r\n\r\nFrom our explanation of the solar spots, we inferred the existence of\r\nanother large planet in the system. Might not the same effect be\r\nproduced by a comet? Or may there not be so many comets, whose great\r\nelongation, combined with even a moderate mass, may render it impossible\r\nto calculate the position of the sun with respect to the central axis of\r\nthe vortex,--always considering this last as the axis of equilibrium? In\r\na general way, we might say that the very number of comets in all\r\ndirections and all distances, would tend to neutralize each other's\r\neffects; but we are not under this necessity. A comet, moving in a\r\nparabola, does not belong to the system or to the rotating vortex; and\r\nthe periodic comets, if of gaseous elements, (as seems so probable,)\r\nmust, from the size of their nuclei, which the theory considers the only\r\npart constituting their mass, have far less mass than the very smallest\r\nof the asteroids, and consequently could have very little effect on the\r\nmechanical balance of the vortex, even if elongated as far as the orbit\r\nof Neptune. Did we know the influence of cold in limiting the\r\nexpansibility of the elementary gases, we might approximately determine\r\nthe mass of a comet, from the size of its nucleus; but this is a problem\r\nthat has never yet been solved; and astronomers ought to avail\r\nthemselves of every indication which promises to realize this great\r\ndesideratum. The grand comet of 1556 is now probably approaching, and,\r\nfrom recent investigations, it appears that it will arrive at its\r\nperihelion in 1858,--subject to an error either way of about two years.\r\nAn opportunity may thus be presented of determining the mass of one of\r\nthe largest comets on record, which may not again occur. This arises\r\nfrom the possible appulse of the comet to the planet Pallas, whose mass,\r\nbeing so small, would more sensibly be disturbed by such an appulse than\r\nthe earth. As the inclinations and ascending nodes of the two orbits\r\napproximately coincide, and as Pallas will be near the comet's path, on\r\nthe approach of the latter to the sun, at the beginning of the year\r\n1857, should the comet become visible about that time, a very close\r\nappulse is possible. It is not unlikely, also, that if the elements of\r\nPallas were so far perfected as to afford reliable indications, that the\r\nnear approach of the comet might thus be heralded in advance, and lead\r\nto an earlier detection of its presence. Would it not be a worthy\r\ncontribution to science, for some one possessing the necessary leisure,\r\nto give an ephemeris of the planet for that epoch; as a very slight\r\nchange in Mr. Hind's elements of the comet, would cause an actual\r\nintersection of the two orbits in about heliocentric longitude 153d? The\r\nsubsequent nodal passage of Pallas will take place near opposition, and\r\nbe very favorably situated for determining the instant of its passage;\r\nand, of all the elements, this would be more likely to be affected than\r\nany other.[47]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ZODIAL LIGHT.\r\n\r\nA phenomenon, akin to that which we have just been considering, is\r\npresented by that great cone of diffused light which accompanies the\r\nsun, and which in tropical climes displays a brilliancy seldom witnessed\r\nin high latitudes, on account of its greater deviation from the\r\nperpendicular. Sir John Herschel conjectures that it may be \"no other\r\nthan the denser part of that medium, which, as we have reason to\r\nbelieve, resists the motion, of comets,--loaded, perhaps, with the\r\nactual materials of the tails of millions of those bodies, of which they\r\nhave been stripped in their successive perihelion passages, and which\r\nmay be slowly subsiding into the sun.\" If these materials have been\r\nstripped, it is due to some force; and the same force would scarcely\r\npermit them to subside into the sun. Once stripped, these portions must\r\nbe borne outwards, by the radial stream, to the outer verge of the\r\nsystem. Still, there are, no doubt, denser particles of matter, of the\r\naverage atomic density of Mercury and Venus, which can maintain their\r\nground against the radial stream, and continue to circulate near the\r\ncentral plane of the vortex, in all that space between the earth and the\r\nsun. But if the zodial light be the denser part of that medium, which\r\nastronomers now generally recognize as a resisting medium, how happens\r\nit that it should be confined to the plane of the ecliptic? Why should\r\nit not be a globular atmosphere? Here, again, our theory steps in with a\r\ntriumphant explanation; for while it permits the accumulation of such\r\nparticles around the equatorial plane of the sun, it allows no\r\nresting-place very far removed from this plane. The zodial light,\r\ntherefore, is not the resisting medium, but the passage of the radial\r\nstream through a diffuse nebula of atoms, brought down the poles of the\r\nvortex by the polar current, and held in check along the central plane\r\nby gravitation.\r\n\r\nIf these atoms partook of the velocity of the ether, they would not be\r\nluminous; but being held back by gravitation, they are opposed to the\r\nradial stream, and hence the light.\r\n\r\nMany stars are also nebulous. In some cases we see the nebulosity\r\nedgewise, or along the equatorial planes of the stellar vortices; in\r\nothers we look down the poles, and the nebulosities are circular, and\r\nthere is an endless variety in the shape and intensity of this light.\r\nBut the universe seems full of motion, and we are not justified in\r\nsupposing, because a star shows no such light, that it is without\r\nrotation. The parallax of the nearest star is only one second, the whole\r\nlenticular mass of light which surrounds our sun would therefore only\r\nsubtend an angle of a single second at the nearest fixed star. Seeing\r\nits extreme faintness, therefore, the effulgence of the star would\r\nrender it totally invisible, provided that it _could_ traverse the vast\r\nimmensity of intervening space, without feeling the influence of that\r\nextinction, which Struve has proved does actually diminish the number of\r\nvisible stars.\r\n\r\nCorruscations and flickerings have also been noticed in the zodial\r\nlight, and as usual, the learned have suggested atmospheric conditions\r\nas the cause, instead of trusting to the evidence of their own senses.\r\nHow prone is philosophy to cling to that which is enveloped in the mist\r\nof uncertainty, rather than embrace the _too simple_ indications of\r\nnature. As if God had only intended her glories to be revealed to a\r\nfavored few, and not to mankind at large. Blessed will be the day when\r\n_all_ will appreciate their own powers and privileges, and no longer\r\nregard the oracles which emanate from a professional priesthood, whose\r\ndicta have so often tended to darken the simple counsels of truth! To\r\nset the question of pulsations in the zodial light, as well as in the\r\ntails of comets, at rest, only requires previously concerted\r\nobservations, in places not very widely apart; for it is scarcely\r\npossible, that atmospheric conditions should produce simultaneous\r\npulsations in two distant places. If the pulsations are found to be\r\nsimultaneous, they are real; if not simultaneous, they may depend on\r\nsuch conditions; but from the nature of the cause, we should look for\r\nthem as much in the zodial light, as in the aurora borealis, regarding\r\nthe different intensities.\r\n\r\nThere is also reason to suspect that the northern side is always the\r\nbrightest, both in spring and autumn. On the morning of October 4th,\r\n1853, the light was very vivid and well defined, its northern margin\r\ngrazing Regulus and terminating at Mars, which was also to the north of\r\nit. Now, although the _northern side_ was the brightest, the great mass\r\nof light was to the south of the ecliptic, as far down as the cone shape\r\nwas preserved; but at 10d from the horizon, a still brighter mass\r\nprotruded from the cone towards the north, which was all _north_ of the\r\necliptic, and of an irregular form, extending along the horizon. The\r\ntime was 4 A.M., and consequently was not due to any crepuscular light.\r\nAn explanation of the general fact of the brightest light being _always_\r\non the north side, is given in the present section, in connection with\r\nanother phenomenon. If, as some suppose, the light does not reach to the\r\nsun, the annulus must at least fill all the space between Venus and the\r\nearth, but it is far more in accordance with facts as well as with our\r\ntheory, to suppose it increases in density to the body of the sun.\r\n\r\nObservations made at the observatory of the British Association,\r\ndetected, in 1850, sudden brightenings of the light, altogether\r\ndifferent from pulsations. The theory would refer these to that fitful\r\nirregularity in the momentary intensity of the radial stream, which\r\ngives the flickering and tremulous motion to comets' tails. But, the\r\nsteady variations in the intensity of this light must be due to other\r\ncauses. The longitude of the sun will here come in as a modifying cause;\r\nfor the obstruction caused by the body of the sun, when displaced from\r\nthe axis of the vortex, must necessarily exercise an influence on the\r\nforce and direction of the radial stream. A sudden influx of cometary\r\nmatter down the poles of the vortex, in more than usual quantities, will\r\nalso tend to brighten and enlarge the zodial light; and, in this last\r\ncause, we have an explanation not only of ancient obscurations of the\r\nsolar light, but, also, of those phosphorescent mists, such as occurred\r\nin 1743 and 1831, rendering moonless nights so light that the smallest\r\nprint could be read at midnight.\r\n\r\nIn total eclipses of the sun, the denser portion of the zodial light is\r\nvisible as a brilliant corona; but, on such occasions, the brightest\r\nstars only are to be seen, and, consequently, the fainter portions of\r\nthe light must be invisible. Hind mentions as many as ten stars visible\r\nin the total eclipse of 1842. According to the same authority, the color\r\nof the corona was like tarnished silver, and rays of light diverged in\r\nevery direction, and appeared shining through the light of the corona in\r\nthe total eclipse of 1851. In this year on the day of the eclipse (July\r\n28th), the longitude of the sun was about 340d, and, therefore, the body\r\nof the sun obstructed the radial stream as seen from the earth on the\r\nright side; but, in 1842, the longitude of the sun was, according to our\r\ntable, about 116d, the sun's centre then being 700,000 miles from the\r\naxis of the vortex, and on the opposite side with respect to the earth;\r\nthe position was, therefore, not so favorable for the appearance of\r\nthese rays which, in many cases, have given the appearance of a whirling\r\nmotion to the corona.\r\n\r\nAt this date, July 7th, 1842, the corona, according to Prof. Airy,\r\n\"possibly had a somewhat radial appearance, but not sufficiently marked\r\nto interfere with the general annular structure.\" Mr. Baily, on the\r\ncontrary, says, the corona had the appearance of brilliant rays; and, at\r\nMilan, long jets of light were particularly noticed. There can be no\r\ndoubt but that the passage of the radial stream past the outer margin of\r\nthe moon must also give rise to the same phenomena as when passing the\r\nsun, and in this we have an explanation of the fact, that, previous to\r\nthe moment of first contact, an appearance resembling a\r\nfaintly-illuminated limb of the moon, has been perceived near the body\r\nof the sun; as well as of those flashes of light which have been\r\nobserved in the lunar disc as the eclipse advances. One important fact,\r\nworthy of note, is, that these luminous streaks are more nearly parallel\r\nthan is due to a radiation from the centre. These streaks have, also,\r\nbeen seen bent at right angles at the middle of their height, as a flame\r\nis by means of a blowpipe, precisely analogous to cometary rays being\r\ndriven backwards to form the tail, as already described, thus indicating\r\na common origin. If the moon had an atmosphere, we should, no doubt, see\r\na greater display; but, having no rotating vortex to protect her from\r\nthe radial stream, her atmosphere must have been long since stripped\r\noff, leaving her exposed to the withering winter blast of the great\r\nstream of the solar vortex. In this connection, we may also allude to\r\nthe appearance of the moon when totally eclipsed. Instead of\r\ndisappearing at these times, she sometimes shines bright enough to\r\nreveal her smallest spots. This has been generally referred to the\r\nrefraction of the earth's atmosphere bending inwards the solar rays. May\r\nit not be owing to the brilliancy of the solar corona, which, in 1842,\r\nwas described as so intense that the eye was scarcely able to support\r\nit? This is a far more palpable cause for the production of this\r\nphenomenon, but of which astronomers cannot avail themselves, as long as\r\nthey are uncertain of the origin of this corona.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOOTING STARS.\r\n\r\nThe continual influx of cosmical matter into the heart of the vortex in\r\never-varying quantities, and speedily dispersed along the central plane,\r\naccording to its density, must necessarily give rise to another\r\nphenomenon to which we have not yet alluded. Scarcely a night passes\r\nwithout exhibiting this phenomena in some degree, and it is generally\r\nsupposed that the hourly average of shooting stars is from five to ten,\r\ntaking the whole year round. The matter composing these meteors we\r\nregard as identical with that mass of diffused atoms which forms a\r\nstratum conforming to the central plane of the vortex, and whose partial\r\nresistance to the radial stream occasions that luminosity which we call\r\nthe zodial light. These atoms may coalesce into spherical aggregations,\r\neither as elastic gas, or as planetary dust, and, passing outward on the\r\nradial stream, will occasionally become involved in the vortex of our\r\nown globe; and being drawn inwards by the polar current, and acted on by\r\nthe earth's gravity, be impelled with great velocity through the\r\nrarefied air of the upper atmosphere. That meteors are more abundant\r\nabout the time of meridian passage of a vortex (or, perhaps, more\r\ncorrectly speaking, from six to twelve hours afterwards, when the\r\ncurrent of restoration penetrates the atmosphere), well accords with the\r\nauthor's observations. It is about this time that high winds may be\r\nlooked for, according to the theory; and it has ever been a popular\r\nopinion, that these meteors are a sign of windy weather. Even in\r\nVirgil's time, the same belief prevailed, as a passage in his Georgics\r\nwould seem to indicate.\r\n\r\n   \"Sape etiam stellas, vento impendente, videbis\r\n    Praecipites coelo labi; noctisque per umbram\r\n    Flammarum longos a tergo albescere tractus;\"\r\n\r\nVirgil was a close observer of nature, and commences a storm with the\r\nwind at south, \"Quo signo caderent Austri;\" just as we have represented\r\nthe usual course when these vortices pass near the observer's latitude.\r\nIt is also a well-known fact, that after a display of meteors, (and we\r\nare now speaking of ordinary displays, and not of the great showers,)\r\nthe temperature falls considerably. It is not uncommon also, that\r\nmeteors are more abundant during an auroral display, as they ought to be\r\nby the theory. We must, however, exempt from this influence those solid\r\nmeteors which sometimes come into collision with the earth, and\r\nafterwards grace the cabinets of the curious. These bodies may be\r\nconsidered microscopic planets, moving in stated orbits with planetary\r\nvelocity, and bear strongly on the explosive theory of Olbers, as fully\r\ndetailed by Sir David Brewster.\r\n\r\nIt is a very remarkable fact, first noticed by Olbers, that no fossil\r\nmeteoric stones have yet been discovered. If this fact be coupled with\r\nthe hypothesis advanced by Olbers, in reference to the origin of the\r\nasteroidal group, we should have to date that tremendous catastrophe\r\nsince the deposition of our tertiary formations, and therefore it might\r\npossibly be subsequent to the introduction of the present race into the\r\nworld. May not some of the legendary myths of the ancient world as\r\nmystified by the Greeks, have for a foundation the disappearance of a\r\nformer great planet from the system? The idea of the existence of seven\r\nplanets is one of the oldest records of antiquity; but the earth of\r\ncourse would not be counted one, and therefore in after times, the sun\r\nwas included to make up the number; just as the signs of the Zodiac have\r\nbeen explained in accordance with the seasons of far later times than we\r\ncan possibly assign for the invention of this division of the heavens.\r\nLet those who have the leisure, try how far the contraction and dilation\r\nof the asteroidal orbits, to some average mean distance, will restore\r\nthem to a common intersection or node, as the point of divergence of the\r\ndifferent fragments. The question is interesting in many of its aspects,\r\nand may yet be satisfactorily answered.\r\n\r\nThe composition of aerolites may also be taken as indications of the\r\ncommon origin and elementary texture of the planets, whether they are\r\nindependently formed or have originally pertained to a former planet;\r\nfor no hypothesis of telluric or selenic origin yet advanced, can stand\r\nagainst the weight of evidence against it. Their fragmentary character\r\nrather favors the views of Sir David Brewster, and when we consider that\r\nthey have been revolving for thousands of years with planetary velocity,\r\nand in very eccentric orbits, through the ether of space, continually\r\nscathed by the electric blast of the radial stream, their rounded\r\nangles, and black glossy crust of an apparently fused envelope, may be\r\naccounted for, without difficulty, from the non-vitrified appearance of\r\nthe interior. The composition of aerolites as far as known, embrace\r\nnearly one-third of all known simple substances according to Humboldt,\r\nand are as follows: iron, nickel, cobalt, manganese, chromium, copper,\r\narsenic, zinc, potash, soda, sulphur, phosphorus, and carbon.\r\n\r\nThe theory we have thus given of the common occurrence of shooting\r\nstars, will render a satisfactory general account of their sporadic\r\nappearance; but there are other phenomena of greater interest, viz.: the\r\noccasional recurrence of swarms of such meteors, which defy all\r\nnumerical estimates, being more like a fiery rain than anything they can\r\nbe compared to. The most interesting feature of this phenomena, is the\r\n_apparent_ periodicity of their return. In the following table we have\r\nset down the most remarkable epochs mentioned by Humboldt, (and no man\r\nhas devoted more attention to the subject,) as worthy of notice:\r\n\r\n  About April      22 to 25\r\n    \"   July       17 to 26\r\n    \"   August      9 to 11\r\n    \"   November   12 to 14\r\n    \"   November   27 to 29\r\n    \"   December    6 to 12\r\n\r\nBesides these, he mentions two showers, from Arabian authority, in\r\nOctober; one in October, observed in Bohemia; one observed by himself,\r\nin the Pacific, on March 15; one February 4, just preceding the terrible\r\nearthquake of Riobamba, in 1797. The Chinese annals also contain many\r\nshowers of stars, before the present era commenced. Some were in March,\r\nmore in July, and others in different months. How, then, in view of\r\nthese numerous dates, can we attach so much importance to the\r\nperiodicity of these showers? The great shower of 1833, in the United\r\nStates, on the 12th and 13th of November, brought to mind the great\r\nshower at Cumana, observed by Humboldt and Bonpland just thirty-three\r\nyears before, to a day; and it must be confessed that more than ordinary\r\ndisplays have been seen on this date. Yet, on the strength of this,\r\nevery meteoric shower is supposed to be periodical, and has resulted in\r\na theory which becomes more complicated as the phenomenon is more\r\nobserved, and can never lead to any useful and practical results. To\r\ncite the numerous instances of discrepant results, would only encumber\r\nthis brief notice with facts neither interesting to the general reader,\r\nnor convincing to those who hold a contrary opinion. The author of these\r\npages has watched for many years, and, in view of all the facts, has\r\nconcluded that the doctrine of periodicity (as held by present\r\nmeteorologists) is not tenable. The celebrated August shower failed,\r\nalso, this year, at least in this place, as for four hours each night,\r\non the 9th, 10th, and 11th, there were fewer bright meteors than at the\r\nclose of July.\r\n\r\nProfessor Olmsted, who has paid considerable attention to the subject,\r\nhas indeed attempted to connect the great November shower with the\r\nzodial light, which last he considers a nebulous body, of an elongated\r\nform, whose external portions, at this time of the year, lie across the\r\nearth's path. (See Silliman's Journal for 1837, vol. xxxiii. No. 2,\r\np. 392.) He even gives its periods, (about six months,) the aphelion of\r\nthe orbit being near the earth's orbit, and the perihelion within\r\nMercury's. In this way he attempts to explain both phenomena; but as the\r\nzodial light is seen unchanged all the year round in tropical latitudes,\r\nit is not the kind of body supposed by Olmsted, and the theory adds\r\nnothing to our knowledge. Others have imagined rings of nebulous matter,\r\nin which all the separate parts are moving in the same orbit around the\r\nsun, with a retrograde motion, and this, with some modifications, is the\r\ncurrent theory of the day. The principal arguments rested on, for the\r\nsupport of this view, are derived from the great shower of 1833, in\r\nwhich a common radiant point was observed, and confirmed subsequently by\r\nthe radiant of other years, in the same month of November. As this point\r\nis almost tangential to the earth's orbit at this season, the earth\r\nmeets the nebulous ring moving in the contrary direction, and thus\r\nconfers on these meteors the necessary velocity that is thought to be\r\ndemanded by observation.\r\n\r\nNow, our theory gives a totally different explanation of the phenomenon.\r\nWe contend that a retrograde motion of such a nebulous mass, is\r\nsubversive of our whole theory; and we must be permitted to examine\r\ncertain points, hitherto disregarded by those entertaining antagonist\r\nviews. It is supposed that the meteors in 1833 fell for eight or nine\r\nhours. The orbital velocity of the earth is more than 1,000 miles per\r\nminute, and the orbital velocity of the nebulous zone must have had a\r\nsimilar velocity. During the nine hours of meteoric display, therefore,\r\nthe earth traversed 500,000 miles of her orbit, which would give\r\n1,000,000 miles for the depth of the nebulous stratum. But if of such\r\nvast extent, how happened it that the only part of the earth in which\r\nthese were visible in great density, was the United States, or a space\r\nembraced between the latitudes of 50d and 20d north, and the longitudes\r\n60d and 100d west, (and these are the widest limits,) comprising only\r\n1/40 of the surface of the globe? To a calm inquirer, this difficulty\r\nseems insurmountable. The author was then in the Mediterranean, on deck\r\nthe greatest part of the night,--the weather fine, and nothing unusual\r\nvisible in the heavens; from other sources he has also derived similar\r\ninformation. Yet, were the earth then passing through a stratum of\r\nmeteors 1,000,000 miles in extent, it is utterly inconceivable that\r\nother portions of the earth escaped. Much stress is also laid on the\r\nfact that these meteors in 1833, passed from east to west generally, as\r\nthey ought to do, if tangential to the earth in her orbit; but on the\r\nsame phenomenon occurring in 1799, when the earth was in precisely the\r\nsame part of her orbit, Humboldt says distinctly, \"the direction (of the\r\nmeteors) was very regular from north to south.\" How could this possibly\r\nhappen, and at the same time be moving tangentially to the orbit?\r\n\r\nThere is also another fact of importance not duly weighed in forming\r\nsuch a theory. In 1833 the meteors evidently differed in velocity; one\r\nclass, consisting of luminous points, passed like a shower of fire with\r\ngreat velocity to the westward, another class were like large fire-balls\r\nwith luminous trains moving with less rapidity, while a third class\r\nconsisted of nebulous patches which remained stationary for a long time,\r\nand frequently emitting large streams of light. These last, at least, do\r\nnot deport themselves as planetary bodies moving 2,000 miles per minute.\r\nBut the fact still remains, that unusual displays have occurred about\r\nthe 12th and 14th of November; and also as a general thing when there\r\nare no unusual displays, the meteors are more abundant about this time.\r\nLet us try if we can reconcile these facts with the theory of vortices.\r\n\r\nWe will first confine our remarks to the increased number of meteors\r\nabout November 12th and 14th. The cosmical matter composing the zodial\r\nlight, or at least the lighter parts of it, is continually driven\r\noutwards by the radial stream, just as the matter of a comet's tail is\r\nstripped from the nucleus. This matter becomes involved in the terral\r\nvortex by descending the poles, and is again passed out along the\r\nequatorial plane. The form of the zodial light, as seen edgewise, gives\r\na lenticular form for the stratum of planetary particles composing it,\r\nand its central plane has been considered as coinciding with the plane\r\nof the sun's equator. At the orbit of the earth, this lenticular space\r\nis narrowed to a very thin stratum, but undoubtedly reaches beyond the\r\nearth's orbit with a rapidly diminishing density. As the axis of the sun\r\nis inclined about 7d to the ecliptic, and the ascending node is in the\r\n20th degree of Gemini, the earth can only pass through the plane of the\r\nsun's equator about the 12th of December and the 12th of June. If,\r\ntherefore, the central plane of the vortex coincides with the plane of\r\nthe sun's equator, meteors ought to be more numerous about the dates\r\nabove mentioned. But the observed times are on November 12th and 13th.\r\nNow, from actual measurements, a computation has been made by M.\r\nHouzeau, that the elements of the zodial light are materially different\r\nfrom those of the sun's equator. He fixes the node of the light\r\n(according to Mr. Hind) in 2d heliocentric longitude, subject to an\r\nuncertainty of 12d or 13d, and its inclination to the plane of the\r\necliptic, 3d 35', subject to an uncertainty of about 2d. The truth is,\r\nastronomers have argued the coincidence of the two planes from\r\nconsiderations connecting the zodial light with the sun's equator, as if\r\nit were a solar atmosphere; but such an atmosphere is impossible, and it\r\nis high time such measures should be taken as will lead to some certain\r\nconclusion. If in the present state of the question, we were to take the\r\nmean, we should find the node in about longitude 40d, which is the\r\nposition of the earth on November 2d. But in the absence of\r\nmeasurements, we will assume, for the sake of argument, that the\r\nascending node of the central plane of the vortex was, in 1833, in 50d\r\nheliocentric longitude, and consequently the earth was passing through\r\nthe meteoric stratum or central plane of the zodial light, on the night\r\nof November 12th. The opposite period of the year is May 12th--a date,\r\nit is true, on which no great shower of stars is recorded, but sporadic\r\nmeteors are very plentiful at that time, and what is more important to\r\nobserve is, that the 11th, 12th, and 13th of May, are the three noted\r\n_cold days_ which we have before mentioned. Thus truly indicating that\r\nthe earth is then in or near the central plane of the vortex along which\r\nthe radial stream is at its maximum of power at any given distance from\r\nthe axis.\r\n\r\nBut the question occurs, does the node of this plane remain stationary,\r\nand is there no variation of the inclination of the axis of the solar\r\nvortex? We have found from observation, that the axis of the terral\r\nvortex is continually oscillating about a mean position by the action of\r\nthe moon; and reasoning from this analogy, and the constant tendency of\r\na material vortex to preserve a dynamical balance, the same tendency\r\nmust obtain in the solar vortex under the action of the great planets,\r\nwhose orbits do not coincide with the central plane of the vortex. The\r\nascending node of Jupiter's orbit is in longitude 98d, Saturn's 112d,\r\nUranus' 72d, Neptune's 131d; so that this plane does not correspond with\r\nthe plane of greatest inertia discovered by La Place, and from the\r\nnon-coincidence of these planes with the central plane of the vortex,\r\nmust produce the same oscillation in the axis of the solar vortex, as\r\nthe moon does in the terral vortex, but to what amount, observation can\r\nalone determine. Jupiter and Saturn will of course exert the greatest\r\ninfluence, and when these two planets are in conjunction, the ascending\r\nnode of the central plane of the vortex will vary in longitude perhaps\r\nsufficiently to bring the meteoric maximum at the ascending node into\r\nOctober on the one hand, and to the close of November on the other, and\r\nat the descending node to April 25th on the one hand, and the close of\r\nMay on the other.\r\n\r\nThe great showers of stars which have been recorded, must be therefore\r\nconsidered as an accidental exaggeration of a perennial phenomenon,\r\nattaining its maximum when the earth passes through the central plane of\r\nthe vortex, whose ascending node in 1833 we will suppose was in\r\nlongitude 50d. This theory will therefore account for those great\r\nshowers which have occurred about the 24th of April, as well as those\r\noccurring in October and November; for it is far more consonant to all\r\nanalogy, to suppose the influx of planetary atoms into the solar vortex\r\nto be in irregular, than in regular quantities. Yet, whether in the one\r\ncase or in the other, the matter will pass along the central plane of\r\nthe vortex, either diffusely scattered or in denser clouds, and will be\r\nencountered by the earth when near the nodes _more frequently than at\r\nother times_. The phenomenon of 1833, may then be attributed to the\r\nearth encountering an unformed comet on the 12th of November; but we\r\nmust reflect, that the medium of the vortex is also in motion, and the\r\ncometary matter drifting along with it; and that this motion corresponds\r\nwith the earth's motion. By becoming involved in the terral vortex, it\r\nwill in a measure be carried along with the earth in her orbit as a\r\ntemporary occupant of the terral vortex. But we are here met with the\r\nobjection that the radiant being nearly stationary amongst the stars,\r\ndemonstrated conclusively, that the source of these meteors did not\r\npartake of the earth's motion. There is no difficulty in this. We\r\nsuppose as a general thing, that the meteors descended to the surface of\r\nour atmosphere down the axis of the vortex (at least in the greatest\r\nnumbers), and the geocentric longitude of this axis was nearly the same\r\nduring the whole time of the display. We say nearly, for the motion of\r\nthe moon in her orbit in nine hours, would change the longitude of the\r\naxis three or four degrees, and this is about the change in the\r\nposition of the radiant noted at the time. This objection, therefore,\r\nfalls to the ground; for the axis of the vortex, although carried along\r\nwith the earth in her orbit, was unaffected by the earth's rotation, and\r\nwould therefore appear nearly as stationary in the heavens as Gamma\r\nLeonis. But it is again urged, that the moon was near conjunction with\r\nthe sun, and consequently the central vortex was on the opposite side of\r\nthe globe. This is true; but the outer vortex must have been near the\r\nmeridian about three hours after midnight, or about the time when the\r\nradiant was vertical and the display the greatest. When the axis was to\r\nthe eastward, the stars would shoot westward, when on the meridian, they\r\nwould pass in all directions, but principally to the south, on account\r\nof the inclination of the axis of the vortex; but this would only be\r\ntrue for places situated to the southward of the central latitude.\r\nDuring the great shower of stars seen by Humboldt, in Cumana, the\r\ndirection was to the south uniformly. Now, the latitude of Cumana is\r\nabove 10d north, yet still too low for the general limits of the\r\nvortices; but from the same inclination of the axis (from 30d to 36d to\r\nthe surface), the meteors would pass far south of the limit, and might\r\neven reach to the equator. The latitude of the _outer vortex ascending_\r\non November 12th, must have been near the line of greatest display, from\r\nthe position of the moon at the time. We thus see why the phenomenon was\r\nlimited to so small a fraction of the earth's surface; why these meteors\r\nshould be intermingled with nebulous patches stationary in the heavens\r\nfor an hour together, and why, notwithstanding these facts, they were\r\nindependent of the earth's rotation.\r\n\r\nWe have yet another objection to answer, viz.: the planetary velocity of\r\nsome of these bodies. Let us be understood. The velocity of a solid\r\naerolite is due to gravitation, and is planetary, on the other hand,\r\nvoluminous collections of cometary dust united by accident, and\r\nremaining so by mere inertia, are borne passively on the ethereal\r\ncurrents with _electric_ velocity, and probably never penetrate far,\r\neven into the attenuated atmosphere, which may be supposed (from the\r\nfacts connected with the aurora) to extend far above the denser stratum\r\nwhich refracts and reflects light, and from which the assigned limits of\r\nour atmosphere have been derived.\r\n\r\nIt is generally considered that sporadic meteors are more numerous in\r\nthe summer and autumn than in the winter and spring, and we have,\r\nlikewise, in the tenth of August, a date which corresponds to many great\r\ndisplays and meteoric showers, both in recent and remote times. This\r\nwould seem to vitiate our theory; for we cannot suppose that there are\r\ntwo _central_ planes in the vortex intersecting the ecliptic in\r\nlongitude 320d and 50d. We must remember, however, that as these great\r\ndisplays are accidental, and as the stratum composing the zodial light\r\nis manifestly of sufficient thickness to envelope the whole orbit of the\r\nearth, that it does not necessarily follow that the dense portions to\r\nwhich meteoric showers are due, should be always confined to the central\r\nplane of the vortex. And, besides, we have similar displays recorded in\r\nother months, which invalidates the theory of a regularly-recurring\r\nphenomenon. We shall, therefore, only aim at explaining why meteors are\r\ngenerally more abundant in summer and autumn than in the opposite\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nThe axis of the solar vortex, considered as cylindrical, must be\r\nadmitted to run out to a great depth on either side from the sun, and\r\nreach far into that unoccupied space intervening between our system and\r\nthe nearest fixed stars, and from these opposite points the solar vortex\r\nis supplied with that stream of ether which passes down either pole to\r\nrestore a partial equilibrium in the density of the ether of the vortex,\r\nrarefied by centrifugal force. As certain portions of the heavens are\r\ncrowded with stars, and other parts comparatively vacant, we may expect\r\na similar inequality in the distribution of that cometic dust, which\r\ncauses a certain amount of extinction in the light of the stars, and,\r\ntherefore, seeing that the two extremities of the axis of the solar\r\nvortex are so widely separated, it would not be wonderful if different\r\nquantities of such matter were brought down into the vortex from these\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\nFrom recent observations made by H. R. Birt, at the observatory of the\r\nBritish Association, it would appear that the brightest portion of the\r\nzodial light is always north of the ecliptic. Others have also remarked\r\nthe same, and if we couple this fact with the suggestion just made, we\r\nare justified in suspecting that a greater quantity of cometic dust\r\ncomes down the northern pole of the vortex than down the southern. This\r\nmatter, in passing outward, does not, of course, immediately attain to\r\nthe central plane of the vortex, but is more thickly distributed along a\r\nplane parallel to this plane. And the same will be observed by that\r\nmatter coming down the southern pole; it will be, in a certain degree,\r\nretained in a plane south of the central plane, but still parallel with\r\nit. This would account for the greater brightness of the northern side\r\nof the zodial light. It would, also, account for the greater frequency\r\nof meteors in summer and autumn than in the opposite seasons. From May to\r\nNovember the earth is above the central plane of the vortex, and,\r\nconsequently, on the northern side; but after passing the node in\r\nNovember, she is on the under or southern side, and the meteors are less\r\nfrequent. With this general explanation we shall close. If what we have\r\nadvanced be an approximation to the truth, the theory itself affords\r\nample indications of what observations are requisite to prove or\r\ndisprove it; and, on this account, a theory is of great benefit, as\r\nsuggestive of many questions and combinations of facts which otherwise\r\nmight never be thought of.\r\n\r\nWe have thus taken a cursory glance at the prominent physical phenomena\r\nof the world, and attempted to link them together in the bonds of one\r\nall-pervading principle. We have fearlessly taken a new path, and claim\r\noriginality for the whole, disclaiming all intention of retailing\r\nsecond-hand wares, or of compiling an ingenious theory from\r\nheterogeneous scraps. If it be true, or if it be partially true, let\r\nthose professionally engaged in such pursuits enter the wide field of\r\ninvestigation we have discovered for them; for if the whole theory be\r\ntrue, it only shows in a clearer light that the great work which has\r\nbeen fancied so near completion is scarcely yet begun; while the\r\nprospect of an ultimate and final completion of the temple which so many\r\nzealous votaries are erecting, is rendered mournfully hopeless by the\r\ncontemplation of what yet remains to be performed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] The orbit this year was determined under very unfavorable\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n[43] According to other tables, this angle would be much greater than is\r\ngiven in Mr. Hind's catalogue.\r\n\r\n[44] Prin.

Prop, xxxix., also Prop, xli.\r\n\r\n[47] In making this suggestion, the author is well aware that\r\nEphemerides of the four chief asteroids have been given annually in the\r\nGreenwich Nautical Almanac; but for the object proposed they are utterly\r\nuseless. Will any astronomer contend that these Ephemerides are true to\r\nten seconds of arc? If not, they are useless for the purpose suggested\r\nabove, and the theory wants revision. And it is evident that any\r\nobjection against its practicability, founded on the uncertainty of the\r\nnumber of the asteroids themselves, as has already been urged in answer\r\nto this suggestion, is an evidence that the objector weighed the subject\r\nin the scales of his imagination only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION SIXTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLAR ICE.\r\n\r\nWe shall conclude these pages by again referring to our theory of the\r\nweather, in connection with an event which every friend of humanity and\r\nevery lover of natural science is bound deeply to deplore.\r\n\r\nFrom the present position of the lunar nodes and apogee, the vortices of\r\nour earth do not ascend into very high latitudes. Now, according to the\r\nprinciples laid down, the frequency of storms tends to lower the\r\ntemperature in the warm regions of the earth, and to elevate it in the\r\npolar regions. Let us suppose the northern limit of the vortices to be\r\nin latitude 70d. There will be, in this case, a greater prevalence of\r\nnortherly winds _within_ this circle of latitude, to supply the drain to\r\nthe southward, and the back currents by passing above will descend at\r\nthe pole, partaking of the temperature due to that elevation. The\r\ncharacter of the arctic seasons may therefore be considered as partly\r\ndependent on the average direction of the wind. Suppose again, the\r\nextreme limits of the vortices to be about latitude 80d, the relative\r\nareas of the two circles are as 4 to 1; so that in this last case the\r\nexclusive range of the northerly winds is limited to one-fourth of the\r\nfirst area. South of 80d the wind will frequently come from the south,\r\nand by mixing with the local atmosphere of that latitude, will tend to\r\nameliorate the small area to the northward. And the greater atmospheric\r\ncommotion when confined to such a small circle of latitude, must assist\r\nmaterially to break up the polar ice; which would tend still more to\r\nequalize the temperature.\r\n\r\nBy referring to our table, we see that the mean conjunction of the pole\r\nof the lunar orbit and the moon's apogee, was in longitude 128d on April\r\n10, 1846, and let it be remembered that when the conjunction takes place\r\ndue south or in longitude 270d, the vortices attain their greatest\r\nlatitude north. When, on the contrary, the conjunction takes place due\r\nnorth or in longitude 90d,[48] the northern limits of the vortices are\r\nthen in the lowest latitude possible.\r\n\r\nSir John Franklin sailed in May 1845, and was certainly at the entrance\r\nof Wellington sound, near latitude 75d, April 3d, 1846, as the dates on\r\nthe graves testify. That season, according to the theory, was a cold\r\none; for the vortices could not reach so far to the northward in that\r\nyear, and consequently there were no storms, properly speaking. It would\r\nprobably be late in the summer of 1846, before the expedition was\r\nliberated, and as the prevailing winds would be from the northward, he\r\nwould have little choice, but to stand to the westward if the state of\r\nthe ice permitted. In his instructions he was to use every effort to\r\npenetrate to the southward and westward of Cape Walker, and he probably\r\nconformed to them under the circumstances, and passed the winter in the\r\nice, in that neighborhood. And in 1847 we do not anticipate, from the\r\ntheory, that he would make much progress westward.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, Sir James Ross was sent out with the first relief-ship; but was\r\nnot able to reach the entrance of Wellington channel because of compact\r\nice from there to Leopold Island. This was about the beginning of\r\nSeptember--a time when the northern channels are usually the most open.\r\nOn the 11th, they ran the ships into Port Leopold, and the next day the\r\nice shut them in for the winter. From the character of the season, we\r\nmay infer that if Franklin did not enter Wellington channel in 1847, as\r\nis most probable, neither did he in 1848. Perhaps he was not able to get\r\nhis ships far to the westward, as we infer from the theory. Still, as\r\nthe time was not very protracted, he would wait patiently another season\r\nand husband his resources.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Sir James Ross cut his ships clear of the ice August 28th, and\r\ncrossed over to Wellington channel, where he found the land-ice still\r\nfast, showing that this season was also a bad one in accordance with the\r\ntheory. On the 1st of September he met the first gale of wind, at which\r\ntime the _Inner Vortex_ was at its extreme north latitude, and rapidly\r\nextending its limits by the motion of the perigee.\r\n\r\nThis vortex describes a smaller orbit than either the central or the\r\nouter vortex, and consequently reaches into higher latitudes. But the\r\ntime was badly chosen, as the whole series of years since Franklin left\r\nhas been unfavorable for the early rupture of the ice. Sir James Ross\r\nhaving been drifted out of Lancaster sound by the gale, finally bore up\r\nfor England towards the close of September 1849.\r\n\r\nThe same year, the North Star with additional supplies was working up\r\nBaffin's bay; but on account of the unusual quantities of ice, and the\r\nfrosts \"which glued the floes together,\" she was unable to force a\r\npassage through the middle ice, and wintered on the east side of\r\nBaffin's bay, in latitude 76d 33'--her thermometer marking 64d below\r\nzero, as the coldest of the winter. In 1850, the perigee of the moon\r\nattained its northern limit, but the position of the node was bad; still\r\nthis year and 1851, were the best of the series. The North Star\r\nsucceeded in getting out of the ice on the 1st of August--a very early\r\ndate for that high latitude--and on the 8th had crossed over to\r\nPossession bay; but being prevented by the land-ice, she bore up for\r\nPond bay and there landed the provisions. The same year (1850) several\r\nvessels entered Lancaster sound. Sir John Ross also reached Melville\r\nIsland; from which it is evident that this season was far better than\r\nany preceding. According to Captain Penny, this year a floe of ice at\r\nleast two years old, filled Wellington strait; but was diminished in\r\nbreadth at a subsequent visit. He also saw a boundless open sea from the\r\n_western_ entrance of Wellington strait; but of course the ships could\r\nnot reach it, for the floe before mentioned. Following the indications\r\nof the theory, we consider it almost certain that Franklin went to the\r\nwestward and not through Wellington channel; that he made but slow\r\nprogress until 1850, when finding the sea more open to the northward,\r\nand attributing it more to local influences than to any change in the\r\nseason, he considered it a better course to extricate the expedition, by\r\npushing on towards Behring's straits than to attempt the frozen channels\r\nhe had already passed through. But the seasons again getting worse after\r\n1850, he was again arrested in the polar basin by the ice and islands\r\noff the northern coast of America.\r\n\r\nRegarding the old and new continents as in reality a connected body of\r\nland, with a polar depression, we may expect that the great range of\r\nAmerican mountains is continued in a straight line, from the mouth of\r\nthe McKenzie river, obliquely across the Polar sea, and connects with\r\nthe Ural; and that along the axis of the chain, protuberant masses will\r\nemerge above the sea level, constituting an archipelago of islands, from\r\nNova Zembla to the McKenzie; and that these islands, causing an\r\naccumulation of ice, and arresting its general tendency to the\r\nsouthward, is the barrier which Sir John Franklin was finally stopped\r\nby, in a situation where he could neither advance nor return. With the\r\nmap before us, and the data afforded by former voyages, and guided by\r\nthese theoretical views, respecting the prevailing direction of the\r\nwinds and the character of the seasons, we should locate Sir John\r\nFranklin near latitude 80d, and longitude 145d, in 1851; and as the\r\nseasons would afterwards become more severe, we may consider that he\r\nhas not been since able to change his locality, and dare not desert his\r\nships.\r\n\r\nNo mere stranger can feel a deeper interest than the author, in view of\r\nthe hard fortunes of these hardy explorers, and he would not lightly\r\nadvance such opinions, did he not suppose they were in some degree\r\nreliable. In 1832, he himself crossed the Atlantic, for the purpose of\r\noffering himself to the Geographical Society of London, intending to be\r\nlanded as far northward as possible, with a single companion,[49] from\r\nwhich point he purposed to follow the coast line on foot, with cautious\r\ndiscretion as to seasons, confident that, with arms and ammunition, he\r\ncould support himself for many years. It has always been a grave error\r\nin all these northern land expeditions, that they have been too\r\nunwieldy, too much encumbered with the comforts and luxuries of\r\ncivilization at the outset, and too much loaded with a philosophical\r\nparaphernalia, for a pioneering survey,--and cherishing too fondly the\r\nidea that the wide shores of the Arctic sea could be explored in a\r\nsingle season. Had the British government established a few posts in the\r\nArctic regions in the beginning,--one, for instance, in Lancaster sound,\r\nanother in Behring's Straits, and a third near the mouth of the\r\nCoppermine, volunteers of sufficient scientific attainments might have\r\nbeen procured, to banish themselves to these inhospitable regions for a\r\nterm of years, if assured of triennial supplies; and in this way, by\r\nsummer boat-parties and winter expeditions, over land or ice, the\r\nexplorations could have been gradually extended, and a greater knowledge\r\nof the polar regions might have been acquired, with an immense saving\r\nboth of life and money. In 1832 the author's plan was deranged, by\r\nfinding that Captain Back was about setting out in quest of Ross, who\r\nhad then been some four years absent. This officer had all his party\r\nengaged when the author waited upon him in Liverpool, and no notice was\r\ntaken of a modified plan which he forwarded to the Society at his\r\nsuggestion. It was therefore abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe above fact is alluded to, in order to show the author's sincerity in\r\nexpressing his belief that, with a previous preparation of mind and body\r\nfor a sojourn in those frigid climes, a sufficient subsistence may be\r\nderived from the country itself. Advantage must, of course, be taken of\r\nthe times of abundance, and due preparation made for the season of\r\nscarcity. Averaging the extremes, there is little doubt but that both\r\nland, and air, and water, afford an abundance of food for man in the\r\nArctic zone, and that, when spurred by necessity, it is within his power\r\nto obtain it. We ought not therefore to despond, or give up efforts to\r\nrescue those who have well earned the sympathy of the world, by what\r\nthey must have already suffered. _These northern seas will yet be\r\nexplored._ The very difficulty of accomplishing it, will itself give it\r\na charm, which in this restless age will operate with increasing power.\r\nAnd should efforts now be relaxed, and in some future time the evidence\r\nbe brought to light that some of the party yet existed, long after all\r\nefforts to rescue them had been abandoned, the fact would be a dark spot\r\non the escutcheon of England, which time could not erase.\r\n\r\nSince these pages were written, accounts have been received from Captain\r\nMcClure, of H. M. ship Investigator, which fully confirm the preceding\r\nremarks on the character of the seasons in the Arctic circle; and, more\r\nrecently, despatches have been received from the discovery-ship,\r\nAmphytrite, in relation to the past season in Behring's straits, which\r\nalso confirms the theory.\r\n\r\nThe Investigator (now supposed to be frozen up in lat. 74d 5' N., and\r\nlong 117d 54' W.,--the last despatch being dated April 10, 1853) passed\r\nround the northern shores of America into the channels communicating\r\nwith Lancaster sound, in 1850, but was unable to extricate herself in\r\n1852, and, probably, yet remains in the harbor she made in the winter of\r\n1851, in the position above named. No trace of Sir John Franklin's\r\nexpedition was, however, found, and, indeed, according to our theory,\r\nthe Investigator was not on the most promising ground. We contend that\r\nFranklin has penetrated the pack of apparently perennial ice, which is\r\ncontinually pressing to the southward, and blocking up the passages\r\nbetween the northern islands, or skirting the coast line of the\r\ncontinent; which pack has since increased, and effectually stopped all\r\negress from the open central portions of the polar sea. If Sir John\r\nFranklin is ever heard from, this pack _must be penetrated_, and a\r\npowerful steamer ought to be sent immediately by the British government,\r\nto be ready in Behring's straits early enough to take advantage of the\r\nfirst openings, and make a bold push _due north_, so as to get as\r\nspeedily as possible into the open waters to the north of the pack.\r\n\r\nIf the author could make himself heard at Washington, he would also urge\r\nthe government to lose no time in following our own expedition under Dr.\r\nKane, who, if he finds a clear entrance from Smith's sound into the\r\nArctic sea, may be induced to push on, and endeavor to make his way\r\nthrough the pack towards Behring's straits, and thus fall into the same\r\nsnare as Franklin. According to the theory, the higher the passage into\r\nthe Arctic sea, the less will it be incumbered with ice, and,\r\nconsequently, Smith's sound is the best both to enter and return by; and\r\nhad the author not already smarted enough by having his professions\r\nderided, he would have submitted these views to the patrons of that\r\nexpedition before it sailed.\r\n\r\nThe scientific world is, in reality, chargeable with the disastrous\r\nresults of Franklin's expedition. The polar basin is hemmed in by the\r\ncoast line of Europe, Asia, and America, in about latitude 70d north,\r\nfor the greatest part of the entire circumference. And this coast line,\r\nand the islands adjacent, will cause the polar ice to accumulate and\r\nform a frozen belt along these shores, in consequence of the constant\r\ntendency of the earth's rotation to press the ice to the southward. The\r\nfact that an open passage exists between this belt and the shore in\r\nsummer time, is no objection, as the tides, river currents, and warm\r\nland breezes, may very well explain this. The learned have insisted, and\r\ndo yet insist, that the earth's rotation can produce no motions in the\r\nArctic sea, and, under this delusion, Franklin has passed into the\r\ncomparatively open waters inside the pack, perhaps has lost his ships;\r\nyet it is very possible that the party may have escaped, and derived a\r\nsubsistence from the more genial waters of the central portion of that\r\nocean unto this day.\r\n\r\nWe have already alluded to the difference of level between the Atlantic\r\nand Pacific waters. It is well known that the currents in the\r\nSpitzbergen and Greenland seas is to the southward, and that Parry, in\r\nhis attempt to reach the pole, was foiled by this very current,\r\nfrequently setting him back in twenty-four hours more than his party\r\ncould travel in the same time over the ice. Through Baffin's and\r\nHudson's bay the northern waters are also continually bearing their\r\nfrozen freight southward. We are, therefore, entitled to ask, what\r\nsupplies this immense drain? Behring's straits are only about sixty\r\nmiles wide, and twenty-five fathoms deep; the supply, therefore, through\r\nthis channel is totally inadequate, yet there is no other channel into\r\nthe Arctic sea where the current is inward. We have already explained\r\nthe reason why the current through Behring's straits is an exception to\r\nthe general rule, yet still confirming the principle by referring it to\r\nthe configuration of the land enclosing the Pacific ocean. The whole\r\nsouth Pacific lies open to the pole, and the inertia of the immense mass\r\nof mobile waters pressing northward, and continually contracted by the\r\nform of the American and Asiatic coasts, is not balanced by a contrary\r\nimpulse of the waters of the north Pacific, inasmuch as this ocean\r\nbecomes narrower as it extends northward, and the only passage to the\r\nfrozen ocean is through the narrow straits of Behring. The axifugal\r\nforce of rotation due to the northern waters is, therefore, overborne\r\nby the vast preponderance due to the southern waters, and, hence, the\r\nnorthern Pacific may be considered as relatively at a higher level, and\r\nthere will be a current northward through Behring's straits, as we find\r\nit. The same cause accumulates the waters under the equator, thus giving\r\na higher level to the Pacific than to the Atlantic at the isthmus of\r\nPanama, where the difference of level is found by actual measurement to\r\nbe five or six feet. This fact has never before been explained; but the\r\ncause is too obvious to admit of question.\r\n\r\nThat the sea is deeper than was formerly admitted, is now fully\r\nconfirmed. We have before alluded to the results obtained by Captain\r\nDenham, of H. M. ship Herald, who found bottom at 7,706 fathoms, or\r\nabout nine English miles. Now, whether that spherical shell, which we\r\nhave contended to be the true form of the solid earth, be continuous and\r\nentire; or, whether it may not be wanting in localities of limited\r\nextent where the ocean would be absolutely unfathomable, we know not;\r\nbut if such be the internal constitution of our globe, there will be, no\r\ndoubt, many channels of communication between the internal and external\r\nocean, and, as a consequence of the earth's rotation, the axifugal\r\ncurrent of the Arctic sea may be supplied by an upward current from the\r\ninterior of the globe; and this current may have a higher temperature\r\nthan the surface waters of that sea, and thus the middle portions may,\r\nin truth, remain open the whole year round, and be teeming with animal\r\nlife. According to Captain Penny's observations in 1850, whales and\r\nother northern animals existed to the westward, where he saw the open\r\nsea stretch out without a bound before him.\r\n\r\nIt has been a question mooted by some, that Franklin's ships might be\r\novertaken, at an early stage of the voyage, by a storm, and foundered\r\namidst the ice. The theory would give a negative answer to this\r\nquestion. Stiff gales may prevail far to the north when the vortices do\r\nnot reach so high; but no storm, properly speaking, will be found far\r\nbeyond their northern limit. After the coming winter (1853), the\r\nvortices will gradually penetrate farther and farther to the northward,\r\nand the years 1857, 1858, and 1859, will be highly favorable for\r\nnorthern discovery, accompanied, however, with the necessary draw-back\r\nof tempestuous weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[48] The reader will of course understand these as celestial longitudes,\r\nand the latitudes as terrestrial.\r\n\r\n[49] Mr. William McDonald, of Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur theory has thus extended itself beyond those limits which we at\r\nfirst had drawn, and our apology must consist in the necessity existing\r\nfor reconciling the most remarkable phenomena of meteorology to its\r\nprinciples. Yet, after all, what has been said is but an outline of what\r\nremains, but this outline is a part of our theory of the weather, and it\r\ncould not well do without its aid. In some points we may not have\r\ncorrectly interpreted facts; but the facts remain. The numerical\r\nelements of the theory may also be in error--we know not; but we think\r\nthat they are as perfect as the many contingencies on which they depend\r\nwill permit. What is _certain_ however, is of ample value to compensate\r\nfor trivial errors. We have hitherto experienced but little courtesy\r\nfrom those intrusted with the keys of knowledge, and cannot consequently\r\nanticipate a very lenient verdict. But we now tell them before the\r\nworld, that they have a duty to perform, and an examination to make, and\r\na decision to come to, \"whether these things are so.\" Our theory may be\r\ncalled an ingenious speculation, but WE CHALLENGE THE SCIENTIFIC TO\r\nPROVE IT--NOTHING ELSE. The theory furnishes them with tests of daily\r\noccurrence, to prove or to disprove it. By such a trial we are willing\r\nto be judged; but let it be conducted in the spirit recommended in the\r\nopening address before the American Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience, to expose all false developments, and to do it generously and\r\nwithout prejudice; and to remember, \"that the temple of science belongs\r\nto no country or clime. It is the world's temple, and all men are free\r\nof its communion. Let its beauty not be marred by writing names upon its\r\nwalls.\"[50] The _great_ objection, of friction and resistance of an\r\nall-pervading medium, which will be urged against it, we regard as\r\nrather the offspring of a bewildered imagination, than of scientific\r\ninduction. We can discover no such consequences as final ruin to our\r\nsystem through its agency; but even if such were discovered, we may\r\nanswer, that nature nowhere tells us that her arrangements are eternal;\r\nbut rather, that decay is stamped with the seal of the Almighty on every\r\ncreated thing. Change may be one of the great laws of matter and motion,\r\nand yet matter and motion be indestructible. The earth was called into\r\nexistence for a specific object, and when that object is accomplished,\r\nwe are assured that another change awaits her. But when earth, and sun,\r\nand planets, are again redissolved into their primitive state, their\r\natoms will still float on the ever-rolling billows of the great ethereal\r\nocean, to be again cast up, on the shore of time, whenever it pleaseth\r\nHim to say, \"Let there be light.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[50] Prof. Pierce's Address, 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the author's arrival in New York for the purpose of publishing his\r\noutlines, the third and fourth volume of the Cosmos has been placed in\r\nhis hands, containing the latest uranological discoveries and\r\nspeculations. It is now more than twenty years since he began to\r\ninvestigate the subject he has treated of, and fifteen since he first\r\nannounced to the world, that he had satisfactory evidence of his theory\r\nbeing true. Luckily, perhaps, he has been cut off from the great streams\r\nof knowledge; and he may confess that it was with pardonable feelings of\r\ngratification that he discovered in 1853, by the acquisition of the two\r\nfirst volumes of the Cosmos, that the philosophic mind of Humboldt had\r\nalso pondered deeply on the planetary peculiarities of size, density,\r\ndistance, inclination of axes and eccentricities of orbits, without\r\neliciting any satisfactory relations.\r\n\r\nFrom the tenor of the third and fourth volume of this learned summary of\r\nscientific knowledge, it is evident that the question of a medium\r\nfilling space is more and more occupying the learned world; but the\r\nauthor is unable to discover any consistent theory respecting it. The\r\nincreasing interest attaching to it, however, is evidently preparing the\r\nworld for some radical change in preconceived views. The explanation\r\ngiven by this present theory to many prominent phenomena, is so totally\r\ncontrary to that of the learned world, as to leave it untouched by\r\nanything yet advanced. What the fifth volume of the Cosmos will\r\ncontain, is not yet known in this country, neither has the author been\r\nfavored with any glimpse of the progress of science as developed before\r\nthe British Association; he supposes, however, that he yet stands alone\r\nin the position he has defined.\r\n\r\nAs a question of practical importance, the reader will find in the work\r\ncited, the various opinions of the temperature of space. Both Fourier\r\nand Poisson regard this as the result of radiated heat from the sun and\r\nall the stars, minus the quantity lost by absorption in traversing the\r\nregions of space filled with ether.[51] But why should we regard the\r\nstars as the source of all motions? Why cannot physicists admit the idea\r\nof an infinite space filled (if we may use the expression) with an\r\ninfinite medium, possessing an unchangeable mean temperature long before\r\nthe formation of a single star. A star equal to our sun at the distance\r\nof Sirius, would give about one million of million times less heat than\r\nour present sun, which is only able to give an average temperature to\r\nthe whole globe--about twenty degrees above freezing--then let us\r\nremember that there are only about fifty stars of the first and second\r\nmagnitude, which give more light (and by analogy heat also) than all the\r\nrest of the stars visible. Such labored theories as this of Poisson's is\r\na lamentable instance of the aberrations of human wisdom.\r\n\r\nWe would also call the reader's attention to a late conclusion of\r\nProfessor Dove, viz.: That differences of temperature in different\r\nlongitudes frequently exist on the same parallel of latitude, or, in\r\nother words, are laterally disposed. This may be thought adverse to the\r\ntheory, but it should be borne in mind that the annual mean temperature\r\nof the whole parallel of latitude should be taken when comparing the\r\ntemperatures of different years.\r\n\r\nAnother fact cited in the Cosmos apparently adverse to the theory, is\r\nthe idea entertained by Sir John Herschel, that the full-moon\r\ndissipates the clouds. This question has been fully examined by\r\nProfessor Loomis before the American Association, and he concludes that\r\nthere is not the slightest foundation for the assertion--taking as data\r\nthe Greenwich observations themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[51] See _Cosmos_, p. 41, vol.
