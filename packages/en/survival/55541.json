He has consulted many valuable papers published during the last\r\nthirty years, in the various professional journals in England, America,\r\nFrance, and Germany, upon this important subject, and has also obtained\r\nmuch useful information from the works of Evelyn, Nicholson, Tredgold\r\nby Hurst, Papworth, Burnell, Blenkarn, and other English writers upon\r\ntimber; Silloway, of North America; Porcher, of South America; Du Hamel,\r\nDe Moray, and De Lapparent, of France; and several writers whose works\r\nwill be referred to.\r\n\r\nIt is many years since a separate and complete work on dry rot has been\r\npublished, and those who are desirous of inquiring into the matter are\r\nfrequently at a loss where to obtain any information. Existing works on\r\nthe subject are out of print, and although they can be seen at a few\r\nprofessional institutes, they are beyond the reach of the general public.\r\n\r\nIt has been the aim of the author in preparing this treatise to give a\r\nfair hearing to every patentee, and he has endeavoured to be as impartial\r\nas possible in recording instances of failure and success. If he has\r\nerred in any particular case, he will be happy, should this work reach a\r\nsecond edition, to make any necessary correction.\r\n\r\nThe reader will probably find some things repeated in the course of the\r\nwork; this is in many cases unavoidable, and in some advisable; for if by\r\na little tautology important truths can be impressed upon the mind of the\r\nreader, the author will feel that his labour in preparing this work has\r\nnot been altogether in vain.\r\n\r\nModern authorities have been relied upon in preference to ancient ones:\r\nthe following sentence, written by the late Sydney Smith, is quoted as a\r\nreason for so doing:\r\n\r\n“Those who come first (our ancestors) are the young people, and have the\r\nleast experience. We have added to their experience the experience of\r\nmany centuries; and, therefore, as far as experience goes, are wiser, and\r\nmore capable of forming an opinion than they were.”\r\n\r\n    20, LIMES GROVE, LEWISHAM,\r\n    _May 14th, 1875_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n    On the Nature and Properties of Timber                          Page 1\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    On the Gradual Rise and Development of Dry Rot                      14\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n    On Felling Timber                                                   51\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    On Seasoning Timber by Natural Methods, viz.

It\r\nis semi-fluid, and semi-transparent, and in this condition is found\r\nabundantly between the bark and the wood of all trees in early spring;\r\nand thus separates those parts so as to permit the bundles of young wood\r\nto pass down from the leaves, and thus enable the tree to grow. It is\r\nunder these conditions that the woodman strips the bark from trees which\r\nare to be cut down, since then it does not adhere to the wood.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the formation of any tissue from the formative fluid\r\nis the production of a solid structureless fabric called _Elementary\r\nMembrane_, and a modification of that fabric termed _Elementary Fibre_.\r\n\r\nThe structures which are produced from the above-mentioned “raw\r\nmaterial” are very varied in appearance, and are called _Cellular\r\nTissues_, to signify that they are made up of hollow cells. The spaces\r\nbetween the cells are called _Intercellular Spaces_, which are of vital\r\nimportance, as they contain air. _Woody fibre_ constitutes the mass of\r\nthe stems of our forest trees. Its peculiar characteristic is that of\r\ngreat tenacity, and power of resistance, and for this its structure is\r\nadmirably adapted: it consists of bundles of very narrow fibres, with\r\ntapering extremities, and is so placed from end to end, that the pointed\r\nends overlap each other. Each fibre is very short, and the partitions\r\nwhich result from the apposition of the fibres, end to end, do not\r\ninterfere with the circulation through them. The tube is not composed\r\nof simple thin membranes only; but in addition has a deposit within it,\r\nwhich, without filling the tube, adds very greatly to the strength of\r\nthe fibre: an arrangement whereby the greatest strength and power of\r\nresistance and elasticity shall be obtained; and, at the same time, the\r\nfunctions of circulation uninterruptedly maintained. The strength is\r\nmainly due to the shortness of each fibre, the connection by opposite\r\nends of many fibres, almost in one direct line, from the root upwards;\r\nand lastly, to the deposit on the inner side of the membrane. The uses\r\nof woody fibre are very varied and most important; it is the chief organ\r\nof circulation in all wooded plants, and, for this purpose, pervades\r\nthe plant from the root to the branches. The current in this tissue\r\nis directed upwards from the shoot, through the stem to the leaves,\r\nand downwards from the leaves through the bark to the root. Thus, its\r\ncurrent has a twofold tendency; the ascending and chief one being for\r\nthe purpose of taking the raw, or what is called the _common sap_, from\r\nthe ground to be digested in the leaves, and the descending being devoted\r\nto the removal from the leaves of the digested, or what is termed the\r\n_proper sap_, to be applied to the purposes of the tree, and also of the\r\nrefuse matter to be carried to the roots, and thence thrown out into the\r\nsoil as a noxious material. The _proper sap_ differs considerably in\r\ndifferent trees; it is always less liquid, and contains a much greater\r\nproportion of vegetable matter than the common sap. It is very probable\r\nthat trees of the same kind produce proper sap of different qualities in\r\ndifferent climates.\r\n\r\nWOODY FIBRE may be considered the storehouse of the perfected secretions.\r\nIt is well known that as trees advance in life, the wood assumes a darker\r\ncolour, and more particularly that lying near to the centre of the stem.\r\nThis is due to the deposit of the perfected juices in the woody fibre at\r\nthat point; and where age has matured the tree, it is probable that the\r\nwoody fibre so employed is no longer fitted for the circulation of the\r\nsap; and, also, that the perfected sap, when once deposited, does not\r\nagain join in the general circulation. The dark colour of the heart of\r\noak, as contrasted with oak of very recent growth, is an illustration\r\nof this fact, as is also the deep colour which is met with in ebony and\r\nrose-wood. Technically, the inner wood is called the heart-wood, and the\r\nouter or younger wood the sap-wood. Of these, the former contains little\r\nfluid, and no vegetable life, and, being the least liable to decay, is\r\ntherefore the most perfect wood; the latter is soft and perishable in\r\nits nature, abounding in fermentable elements; thus affording the very\r\nfood for worms, whose destructive inroads hasten its natural tendency to\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of sap-wood in different trees varies very much. Spanish\r\nchestnut has a very small proportion of sap-wood, oak has more, and fir a\r\nstill larger proportion than oak; but the proportions vary according to\r\nthe situation and soil, and according to the age at which they have been\r\nfelled: for instance, the teak tree in Malabar, India, differs from teak\r\nin Anamalai, South India. This subject has been very fully treated by Mr.\r\nPatrick Williams, in his valuable work on Naval Timber.\r\n\r\nWOODED STEMS are divided into two great and well-defined classes,\r\naccording to their internal conformation, viz. such as grow from without\r\n(exogenous), and such as enlarge from within (endogenous). The former are\r\nmore common in cold, and the latter in hot climates.\r\n\r\nEXOGENOUS STEMS.--On examining a section of a stem of an oak, or any\r\nother of our forest trees, we observe the following parts: first, the\r\npith, or its remains in the centre; second, the bark on the outside;\r\nthird, a mass of wood between the two, broken up into portions by the\r\nconcentric deposition of the layers, and by a series of lines which\r\npass from the centre to the circumference. Thus, there are always pith,\r\nbark, wood, and medullary rays. Each stem has two systems, the cellular\r\nor horizontal, and the vascular or longitudinal, and the parts just\r\nmentioned must belong to one or other of those systems. Thus, the pith,\r\nmedullary rays, and bark belong to the horizontal system; and the wood\r\nconstitutes the longitudinal system.\r\n\r\nTHE PITH occupies the centre of the stem, and remains throughout the\r\nperiod of growth of some trees, as of the elder; or is abstracted after\r\na few years, as in the oak, and almost all large trees. In the latter\r\nclass of trees, there are some remains of the pith for many years after\r\nthe process of absorption has commenced, but at length no vestige can\r\nbe detected, and its position is known only by the central spot around\r\nwhich the wood is placed in circles. In the old age of the tree the pith\r\nfrequently assumes a colour which it has obtained from the juices which\r\nhave been deposited. The connections of the pith are extremely important.\r\nFirstly, it is in direct connection with every branch, and is the\r\nstructure which first conveys fluids to, and receives fluids from every\r\nnew leaf. It thence becomes the main organ of nutriment, and, at the same\r\ntime, the chief depository of the secretions. Secondly, it is in equally\r\ndirect and unbroken connection with the bark, through the medium of the\r\nmedullary rays; and so becomes the centre of all the movements of sap\r\nwhich proceed in the horizontal system.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which the ultimate disappearance of the pith occurs has been\r\na matter of speculation. That the circulation in the heart-wood ceases\r\nafter a certain number of years, and that the connection between it and\r\nthe bark becomes broken, is proved by the fact that numbers of trees\r\nmay be found in tolerably vigorous growth within the bark, whereas at\r\nthe heart they are decayed and rotten. It appears clear that it is not\r\nconverted into wood, and there are facts against the opinion that it\r\nis gradually compressed by the wood; but since it is known that in the\r\ngrowth of the tree much compression of the previously formed wood must\r\noccur, and since this compression is a likely theory by which to account\r\nfor the disappearance of the less resisting pith, it is now generally\r\nconsidered to be one of the causes of this occurrence. As a general rule,\r\nthe pith, so long as it exists, is not mingled with other than cellular\r\nstructures; but, in certain instances, wooden fibre has been found with\r\nit, and, in others, spiral vessels have been detected.\r\n\r\nMEDULLARY SHEATH.--Immediately surrounding the pith of all exogenous\r\nplants, there is a layer of longitudinal tissue, which has received\r\nthe name of medullary sheath. This sheath has no special walls, but is\r\nbounded by the pith on the inner, and the wood on the outer side. It is\r\nin this situation that ducts of various kinds and spiral vessels may be\r\nfound, and in all cases it conveys the longitudinal structure from the\r\nroot, direct to each leaf. The integrity of this structure is therefore\r\nhighly necessary to the life of the tree.\r\n\r\nMEDULLARY RAYS.--These structures come next in order, and, as has been\r\npreviously intimated, belong to the horizontal cellular system of the\r\nstem; they constitute the channel of communication between the bark and\r\nthe pith, and are composed of a series of walls of single cells resting\r\nupon the root, and proceeding to the top of the tree, and radiating from\r\nthe centre. They lie between the wedge-like blocks of wood, and as they\r\nhave a lighter colour than the wood, they are evident on an oblique\r\nsection of any stem, and are called the silver grain. Their colour and\r\nnumber suffice to enable anyone to distinguish various kinds of wood, and\r\ngreatly increase their beauty. They cannot, of course, exist before the\r\nwood is formed, and are therefore not met with in very young trees. They\r\ncommence to exist with the first deposited layers of wood, and continue\r\nto grow outwardly, or nearest to the bark, so long as the wood continues\r\nto be deposited. In those woods which possess in abundance the silver\r\ngrain, another source of ornament exists, viz. a peculiar damask or\r\ndappled effect, somewhat similar to that artificially produced on damask\r\nlinens, moreens, silks, and other fabrics, the patterns on which result\r\nfrom certain masses of the threads on the face of the cloth running\r\nlengthways, and other groups crossways. This effect is observable in a\r\nremarkable degree in the more central planks of oak, especially in Dutch\r\nwainscot.\r\n\r\nTHE BARK.--As the medullary rays terminate in the bark, on their outer\r\nside, the consideration of that part next follows. It forms the sheath\r\nof the tree, and its more immediate use is that of giving protection to\r\nthe wood. If bark did not exist, there would be no formative fluid, and\r\nwithout formative fluid there could not be any deposit of woody fibre.\r\n\r\nWOOD.--We find wood occupying nearly the whole body of the trunk of the\r\ntree, and arranged, as a rule, in a very regular manner. On taking up\r\nany piece of wood, but more particularly the entire section of a stem,\r\nwe first notice a series of circles, which increase in diameter and\r\nseparate by wider intervals as we approach the bark. In this manner the\r\ntrunk is composed of numerous zones enclosed within each other. Again,\r\nin almost all trees, the medullary rays before mentioned may be observed\r\npassing in straight lines from the centre to the circumference; and, as\r\nthe circle of the stem at the bark is much larger than any circle near to\r\nthe centre, it follows that the medullary rays will be wider apart at the\r\nbark than at the pith. On this view of the subject it may be stated that\r\nthe stem is composed of a series of wedge-shaped blocks, which have their\r\nedges meeting at the centre. The combination of these two views gives the\r\ncorrect idea of the arrangement of the wood, viz. a series of wedges,\r\neach divided into segments of unequal width by circular lines passing\r\nacross them. From this description it must not be imagined that these\r\nvarious portions are detached from each other; for although the medullary\r\nrays and the circular mode of deposition both tend to a less difficult\r\ncleavage of the wood, they yet bind the parts very closely to each other.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the occurrence of distinct zones of wood is, that each\r\nzone is the produce of one year, and that in our climate, more so than in\r\ntropical climates, the period of growth of wood ceases for many months\r\nbetween the seasons, and this induces a distinction in appearance between\r\nthe last wood of a former, and the first wood of a succeeding year. This\r\ndistinction is maintained throughout each year, and throughout a long\r\nseries of years.\r\n\r\nThe enclosure of zone within zone, is owing to the mode in which the wood\r\nis produced, and the position in which it is deposited. Wood is formed by\r\nthe leaves during the growing season, and passes down towards the root\r\nbetween the bark and the wood of the previous year; and, as the leaves\r\nmore or less surround the whole stem, the new layer at length completes\r\na zone, and perfectly encloses the wood of all former years. This is\r\nthe explanation of the term exogenous, which is derived from two words\r\nsignifying to grow, outwardly, for the stem increases in thickness by\r\nsuccessive layers on the outer side of the previously formed wood.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the zone for the year is rarely equal around the whole\r\ncircumference of the stem, and this is due to the lesser abundance\r\nof leaves on the branches of one side than on the other, or to the\r\nprevalence of winds, or some other physical cause, acting in that\r\ndirection in opposition to the growing process. It should be observed\r\nthat there is not in timber any appearance of a gradual change from\r\nalburnum to perfect wood. On the contrary, in all cases the division is\r\nmost decided; one concentric layer being perfect wood, and the next in\r\nsuccession sap-wood.\r\n\r\nThe age of trees has been inferred, when a section of the whole stem\r\ncould be examined, by counting the number of rings of wood which have\r\nbeen deposited around the pith. In tropical countries, however, this\r\nmethod cannot be always relied upon.\r\n\r\nWoods are variable in quality according to the nature of the climate, and\r\nof the soil, as also in a considerable degree to the aspect in which they\r\nare situated. Trees grown slowly in open, dry, and exposed situations\r\nare more fine and close in their annual rings, and more substantial\r\nand durable, than those which are grown in close and shady forests, or\r\nrapidly reared in moist or sappy places, the latter being soft and broad\r\nin their rings, and very subject to decay; and their pith is not always\r\nquite in the centre, for the layers are variable also.\r\n\r\nThe waggon maker takes care to combine toughness and durability by\r\nselecting his wood from trees of second growth, or from trees of first\r\ngrowth that from infancy have stood alone, or far apart. If the soft wood\r\ntrees have stood alone, and are very large (as is often the case with\r\nsome of the pines), and most of the branches are near the top, the wood\r\nnear the base of the trunk is sometimes found to be _shaky_. This defect\r\nis produced by the action of heavy winds on the top of the tree, which\r\nwrenches or twists the butt, and thus cleaves apart the fibres of the\r\nwood. If the main-top (_couronnement_, of French writers) of a tree dies\r\nwhile the tree is yet standing, it indicates that water has found its way\r\ninto the trunk, and that the tree is in a state of decay.\r\n\r\nThe fir which grows on very dry marl, forms very narrow yearly rings; if\r\non rich or damp marl, they are wide; and when on wet soil, they are again\r\nsmaller. The common fir on moor soil, has even smaller yearly rings than\r\nif on dry sand or marl. From this it is evident that too wet or too dry a\r\nsoil is not suitable for this tree.\r\n\r\nThe alder and the willow grow best on wet soil, and thrive but poorly\r\nwhen standing dry.\r\n\r\nThe weight of wood is of great importance, because its hardness,\r\nresistance, and its heating power, as well as other valuable properties,\r\nare all more or less depending upon it. In the first place, we must\r\nconsider that even wood which has been forested very light will become\r\nheavy, when put for some time into water, but in such timbers the sap is\r\nalready given to dissolution. If the fibre were the only substance in\r\nthe wood, then the specific weight would depend upon the number of pores\r\ncontained in its body; the pores are, however, filled with a substance\r\nsuch as resin, die, &c. Some years since, when the Indian railways\r\nwere being formed, the native wood-cutters were so well aware of the\r\nabove-mentioned fact, that they used to cut down the soft and inferior\r\nwoods in the forests; soak them in water for a certain time; and then\r\nendeavour to pass them to the railway contractors as sound, heavy, and\r\ngood railway sleepers, and the latter, not being acquainted with the\r\nIndian woods, were, at first, often deceived.\r\n\r\nThe hardest, and heaviest woods come from the hotter climates; the only\r\nexception is the pine, which thrives considerably better, and furnishes\r\nheavier timber, when it has grown in colder regions, or upon high\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nTrees grown on northern slopes furnish lighter timber than if grown on\r\nsouthern or western. The soil has great influence upon the width of the\r\nyearly rings, and from this we are able to come to a conclusion in regard\r\nto the specific weight. In the fir and larch trees the wood is heaviest\r\nwhen their rings are smallest.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the strength of timber between the south and the\r\nnorth side is attributable to the grain being closer on the north side,\r\nas the sap does not rise in the same proportion as upon the south.\r\nIn forest-grown wood the difference is almost imperceptible, as the\r\nsun cannot act upon the trunk of the tree; in open-grown timber, the\r\ndifference is really perceptible. It is well known that all woods do not\r\nlose strength by being open grown, or, in other words, that the south\r\nside is not always weaker than the north; that theory only applies to\r\nthe coniferæ species. In ash it is the opposite, as the south side is\r\nthe strongest. In soft-wooded trees, as the acer species, the difference\r\nis not perceptible, as the annual rings, and the intervening cellular\r\ntissues, are so close akin as to render the wood so compact in its grain\r\nthat there is no difference in its strength. The coniferæ species, or the\r\npines, are the only classes of woods that are stronger on the north side\r\nthan on the south: it is well known that the difference originates in the\r\nwood being more open in the grain on the south side than on the north.\r\n\r\nAn influence upon the specific weight is exercised by the resin, and\r\nthe die, which are contained in the interior of the wood. On level dry\r\nground, or deep sandy soil, we find the fir beautifully red inside;\r\nbut when we look at it on lias soil, it shows broad yearly rings, and\r\nhardly any colour at all. The larch tree, again, in such soil, develops\r\nitself well with a rich colour. The cause for these appearances must\r\ntherefore rest with the chemical condition of the soil, and its effect\r\nupon the individuality of the fir: it is probably the nature of the soil\r\nthat causes the difference of character between Honduras and Spanish\r\nmahogany; Honduras being full of black specks, and Spanish of minute\r\nwhite particles, as if it had been rubbed over with chalk. Oaks generally\r\nfurnish good timber when grown slowly in dry ground, whilst those from\r\nwet soil appear comparatively spongy; similar results are obtained with\r\nother trees.\r\n\r\nMany persons constantly employed on wood are of opinion that it becomes\r\nharder if it is worked or barked whilst green.\r\n\r\nIt is not safe to condemn timber, merely because long cracks are visible\r\non the surface. Such openings are frequently only superficial, and do not\r\npenetrate deeply into the wood: in such cases it is very little weakened\r\nthereby. It is difficult to obtain timber of large scantling without some\r\ndefects of this kind, but care should be taken to ascertain if they are\r\nof a serious nature.\r\n\r\nTrees arrive at an age when their wood becomes ripe, and then they are\r\nfit for felling; but as upon the proper method and time for doing this,\r\nthe prevention of dry rot frequently hinges, a separate chapter is\r\ndevoted to this part of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nON THE GRADUAL RISE AND DEVELOPMENT OF DRY ROT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opinion generally received has drawn a line of discrimination between\r\nthe decay accompanied by a vegetable spreading on the surface of the\r\ntimber, and that which is effected by an animal existing within it,\r\nwhich decay is frequently denominated the worm in timber; but as each is\r\nequally entitled to the dreaded appellation, they might more justly be\r\ndistinguished as the animal and vegetable rot.\r\n\r\nThe dry rot in timber derives its name from the effect produced, and\r\nnot from the cause: it is so called in opposition to the wet rot, which\r\nis properly denominated, as this exists only in damp situations, and is\r\napplied to the decomposition which takes place in timber containing sap,\r\nand exposed to moisture: but although the dry rot is usually generated\r\nin moisture, in some cases it will flourish independent of extraneous\r\nhumidity. Dry rot differs from wet rot in this respect, that the former\r\ntakes place only when the wood is dead, whereas the latter may begin when\r\nthe tree is standing.\r\n\r\nWet rots are composed of porous fibre running from the rot into the\r\ntrunk of the tree. This rot is of a brown colour, and has an offensive\r\nsmell. The evil is often found with white spots, the latter of watery\r\nsubstance: when it has yellow flames, it is very dangerous.\r\n\r\nA large quantity of the vegetable kingdom consists of plants differing\r\ntotally from the flowering plants in general structure, having no\r\nflowers and producing no seed properly so called, but propagating by\r\nmeans of minute cellular bodies, called _spores_. These highly organized\r\nvegetables are known to botanists as _Cryptogamia_. Fungi are plants in\r\nwhich the fructifying organs are so minute, that without the aid of a\r\npowerful microscope they cannot be detected. To the naked eye, the fine\r\ndust ejected from the plant is the only token of reproduction; this dust,\r\nhowever, is not truly seed, for the word seed supposes the existence\r\nof an embryo, and there is no such thing in the reproductive bodies of\r\nfungi. The correct terms are _spores_, when the seeds are not in a case;\r\n_sporidia_ when enclosed in cases. The spores or sporidia are placed\r\nin or upon the receptacle, which is of very various forms and kinds,\r\nbut how different soever these may be, it is the essential part of the\r\nfungus, and in many cases constitutes the entire plant. That portion of\r\nthe receptacle in which the reproductive bodies are imbedded is called\r\nthe _hymenium_: it is either external, as in the Agaric, where it forms\r\ngills; or included, as in the puff-balls. The _pileus_ of fungi is the\r\nentire head of the plant, not a mere head covering.\r\n\r\nSome naturalists have insisted upon the spontaneous production of fungi,\r\nwhile others maintain that they are produced by seed, which is taken\r\nup and supported in the air until a soil proper for its nourishment is\r\npresented, on which being deposited it springs up of various appearances\r\naccording to the principle of the seed, and the nature of the recipient.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult to give a logical definition of what\r\nconstitutes a fungus. It is not always easy with a cursory observation\r\nunder the microscope, to determine whether some appearances are produced\r\nby fungi, insects, or organic disease; experience is the safest guide,\r\nand until we acquire that we shall occasionally fail.\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Index Fungorum Britannicorum,’ 2479 species of British fungi are\r\nenumerated: any detailed account of the arrangement of this extensive\r\nfamily of plants, or of the character of even its principal sections\r\nwould be impossible within the limits of this volume; all that can be\r\nattempted will be a general description of the fungi causing dry rot.\r\n\r\nIf dry rot shows itself in a damp closet or pantry, the inside of\r\nthe china or delf lying there will be coated with a mould, or a fine\r\npowder like brick-dust. This excessively fine powder is no other than\r\nunaccountable myriads of the reproductive spores or _seeds_ of the\r\nfungus; they are red in colour, and are produced on the surface of the\r\nfungus in millions. Certain privileged cells on the face of the fungus\r\nare furnished each with four minute points at their apex, each four\r\nbearing a single brick-red, egg-shaped spore; so that the fruit is spread\r\nover the surface of the fungus in groups of fours. To see the form of\r\nthese spores the highest powers of the microscope are required, and then\r\nthey can only be viewed as transparent objects. If these excessively\r\nminute bodies be allowed to fall on wet flannel, damp blotting-paper, or\r\nwet wood, they immediately germinate and proceed to reproduce the parent\r\nfungus. The red skin of the spores cracks at both ends, and fine mycelial\r\nfilaments are sent out: this is the “mould,” spawn, or mycelium from\r\nwhich the new fungus (under favourable conditions of continued moisture)\r\nappears.\r\n\r\nIt matters little where we go: everywhere we are surrounded with life.\r\nThe air is crowded with birds and insects; the waters are peopled with\r\ninnumerable forms, and even the rocks are blackened with countless\r\nmussels and barnacles. If we pluck a flower, in its bosom we see many a\r\ncharming insect. If we pick up a fallen leaf, there is probably the trace\r\nof an insect larvæ hidden in its tissue. The drop of dew upon this leaf\r\nwill probably contain its animals, visible under the microscope. The\r\nvery mould which covers our cheese, our bread, our jam, or our ink, and\r\ndisfigures our damp walls, is nothing but a collection of plants.\r\n\r\nThe starting point of life is a single cell-that is to say a microscopic\r\nsac filled with liquid and granules, and having within it a nucleus,\r\nor smaller sac. From this starting point of a single cell, this is the\r\ncourse taken: the cell divides itself into two, the two become four, the\r\nfour eight, and so on, till a mass of cells is formed.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Pasteur show that atmospheric dust is filled with\r\nminute germs of various species of animals and plants, ready to develop\r\nas soon as they fall into a congenial locality. He concludes that all\r\nfermentation is caused by the germination of such infinitesimal spores.\r\nThat they elude observation does not seem strange, when we consider that\r\nsome infusoria are only ⅟240000 of an inch in length.\r\n\r\nIt is ascertained that fungi produce seed which contains the properties\r\nof germination; and that vegetable corruption is suited to effect it.\r\nWhen we contemplate the fineness and volatility of the germs, the\r\nhypothesis will not appear unreasonable that they are conveyed by the\r\nrains into the earth, and are absorbed by vegetables; that with the\r\nsap they are disseminated throughout the whole body, and begin to\r\ngerminate as soon as the vegetable has proceeded to corruption. Whatever,\r\ntherefore, may be the appearance or situation of the fungus producing the\r\ndry rot, or from whatever substance it originates, that substance must be\r\nin a corrupt state.\r\n\r\nFungi result from, or are attendant on, vegetable corruption, assisted\r\nby an adequate proportion of heat and moisture. The sap, or principle\r\nof vegetation, brought into activity, is, according to the ‘Quarterly\r\nReview,’ No. 15, the cause of dry rot, in as far as it is favourable\r\nto the growth of fungi, as it would seem to be when in a state of\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nVegetable corruption invariably presupposes fermentation.\r\n\r\nFermentation is a state of vegetable matter, the component parts of which\r\nhave acquired sufficient force to produce an intestinal motion, by which\r\nthe earthy saline, the oily and aqueous particles therein contained,\r\nexert their several peculiar attractive and repulsive powers, forming new\r\ncombinations, which at first change, and at length altogether destroy\r\nthe texture of the substance they formerly composed.\r\n\r\nThere are two things essential towards creating and supporting the\r\nintestinal motion, namely, heat and humidity; for without heat, the air,\r\nwhich is supposed to be the cohesive principle of all bodies, cannot be\r\nso rarefied as to resume its elasticity; and without humidity there can\r\nbe no intestinal motion.\r\n\r\nAccording to Baron Liebig, the decay of wood takes place in the three\r\nfollowing modes:--First, oxygen in the atmosphere combines with the\r\nhydrogen in the fibre, and the oxygen unites with the portion of carbon\r\nof the fibre, and evaporates as carbonic acid: this process is called\r\ndecomposition. Second, we have to notice the actual decay of wood which\r\ntakes place when it is brought in contact with rotting substances; and\r\nthe third process is called putrefaction. This is stated by Liebig to\r\narise from the inner decomposition of the wood in itself: it loses its\r\ncarbon, forms carbonic acid gas, and the fibre, under the influence of\r\nthe latter, is changed into white dust.\r\n\r\nThe fungus occasioning the dry rot is of various appearances, which\r\ndiffer according to the situation in which it exists. In the earth, it\r\nis fibrous and perfectly white, ramifying in the form of roots; passing\r\nthrough substances from the external surface, it somewhat differs from\r\nthat form; here it separates into innumerable small branches.\r\n\r\nMr. McWilliam observes, “If the fungi proceed from the slime in the\r\nfissures of the earth, they are generally very ramous, having round\r\nfibres shooting in every direction. If they arise from the roots of\r\ntrees, their first appearance is something like hoar frost; but they soon\r\nassume the mushroom shape.”\r\n\r\nHence it appears that we frequently build on spots of ground which\r\ncontain the fundamental principle of the disease, and thus we are\r\nsometimes foiled in our endeavours to destroy the fungus by the admission\r\nof air. In this case the disease may be encouraged by the application of\r\nair as a remedy. When workmen are employed in buildings which contain dry\r\nrot, and when they are working on ground which contains the symptoms of\r\nthis disease, their health is often affected. A London builder informs\r\nus, that a few years since, while building some houses at Hampstead\r\nhis men were never well: he afterwards ascertained that the ground was\r\naffected with rot, and that within one year after the house was erected,\r\nall the basement floor was in a state of premature decay. Sir Robert\r\nSmirke, architect, remarked in 1835, that he had noticed “there are\r\ncertain situations in which dry rot prevails remarkably.”\r\n\r\nThe fungus protruded in a very damp situation is fibrous, of moderate\r\nthickness, feels fleshy. From the spot whence it arises it extends\r\nequally around, wholly covering the area of a circle. This form would\r\npossibly continue in whatever situation it might vegetate, if the air had\r\nno motion, and every part of the substance on which it grew were equally\r\nsupplied with a matter proper to encourage the expansion. The surface of\r\nthis fungus is pursed, and of various colours, the centre is of a dusky\r\nbrown, mixed with green, graduated into a red, which degenerates into\r\nyellow, and terminates in white.\r\n\r\nOne of the most formidable of the tribe of fungi is the _Merulius\r\nlachrymans_ (often called _the_ Dry Rot) of which the following\r\ndescription is given by Dr. Greville: “Whole plant generally resupinate,\r\nsoft, tender, at first very light, cottony, and white. When the veins\r\nappear, they are of a fine yellow, orange, or reddish brown, forming\r\nirregular folds, most frequently so arranged as to have the appearance\r\nof pores, but never anything like tubes, _and distilling, when perfect,\r\ndrops of water_.” Hence the term _lachrymans_, from _lacrymo_, Lat., I\r\nweep: the _Merulius lachrymans_ is often dripping with moisture, as if\r\nweeping in regret for the havoc it has made. In the genus _Merulius_,\r\nthe texture is soft and waxy, and the hymenium is disposed in porous or\r\nwavy toothed folds. Berkeley, in his ‘Fungology,’ gives the following\r\ndescription, which is similar to Dr. Greville’s: “Large, fleshy but\r\nspongy, moist, ferruginous yellow, arachnoid and velvety beneath;\r\nmargin tomentose, white; folds ample, porous, and gyroso-dentate.” The\r\n_Merulius_ is found in cellars and hollow trees, sometimes several feet\r\nin width, and is the main cause of dry rot.\r\n\r\nAnother formidable fungi, which attacks oak in ships, is the _Polyporus\r\nhybridus_ (the dry rot of our oak-built vessels). It is thus described by\r\nBerkeley: “White, mycelium thick, forming a dense membrane, or creeping\r\nbranched strings, hymenium breaking up into areæ, pores long, slender,\r\nminute.”\r\n\r\nFrom the slow progress dry rot makes in damp situations, it appears\r\nthat excessive damps are inimical to the fungus, for its growth is more\r\nrapid in proportion as the situation is less damp, until arrived at that\r\ncertain degree of moisture which is suited both to its production and\r\nvegetation. When further extended to dry situations, its effects are\r\nconsiderably more destructive to the timber on which it subsists: here\r\nit is very fibrous, and in part covered with a light brown membrane,\r\nperfectly soft and smooth. It is often of much greater magnitude,\r\nprojecting from the timber in a white spongeous excrescence, on the\r\nsurfaces of which a profuse humidity is frequently observed: at other\r\ntimes, it consists only of a fibrous and thin-coated web irregularly on\r\nthe surface of the wood. Excrescences of a fungiform appearance are often\r\nprotruded amidst those already described, and are evidences of a very\r\ncorrupt matter peculiar to the spots whence they spring. According to the\r\nsituation and matter in which they are produced, they are dry and tough,\r\nor wet, soft, and fleshy, sometimes arising in several fungiforms, each\r\nabove the other, without any distinction of stem; and when the matter\r\nis differently corrupted, it not unfrequently generates the small acrid\r\nmushroom.\r\n\r\nMr. McWilliam observes, “The fungi arising from oak timbers are generally\r\nin clusters of from three to ten or twelve; while those from fir timber\r\nare mostly in single plants: and these will continue to succeed each\r\nother until the wood is quite exhausted.”\r\n\r\nDamp is not only a cause of decay, but is essential to it; while, on the\r\nother hand, absolute wet, especially at a low temperature, prevents it.\r\nIn ships this has been particularly remarked, for that part of the hold\r\nof a ship which is constantly washed by the bilge-water is never affected\r\nwith dry rot. Neither is that side of the planking of a ship’s bottom\r\nwhich is next the water found in a state of decay, even when the inside\r\nis quite rotten, unless the rot has penetrated quite through the inside.\r\n\r\nIt matters little whether wet is applied to timber before or after\r\nthe erection of a building. Timber cannot resist the effect of what\r\nmust arise in either case; viz. heat and moisture, producing putrid\r\nfermentation; for instance, in basement stories with damp under them,\r\ndry timber is but little better than wet, for if it is dry it will soon\r\nbe wet; decay will only be delayed so long as the timbers are absorbing\r\nsufficient moisture, therefore every situation that admits moisture is\r\nthe destruction of timber.\r\n\r\nIn a constancy and equality of temperature timber will endure for ages.\r\nSir Christopher Wren, in his letter to the Bishop of Rochester, inserted\r\nin Wadman’s ‘History of Westminster Abbey,’ notices “That Venice and\r\nAmsterdam being both founded on wooden piles immersed in water, would\r\nfall if the constancy of the situation of those piles in the same element\r\nand temperature did not prevent the timber from rotting.” Nothing is more\r\ndestructive to woodwork than _partial leaks_, for if it be kept _always\r\nwet_ or _always dry_, its duration is of long continuance. It is recorded\r\nthat a pile was drawn up sound from a bridge on the Danube, that parted\r\nthe Austrian and Turkish dominions, which had been under water 1500 years.\r\n\r\nThe writer of an article on the decay of wood, in the ‘Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica,’ 1855, observes, “If a post of wood be driven into the\r\nground, the decay will commence at the surface of the ground; if driven\r\ninto the earth through water, the decay will commence at the surface of\r\nthe water; if used as a beam let into a damp wall, rot will commence just\r\nwhere the wood enters the wall.”\r\n\r\nHumboldt observes in his ‘Cosmos,’ with reference to damp and damp rooms,\r\nthat anyone can ascertain whether a room is damp or not, by placing a\r\nweighed quantity of fresh lime in an open vessel in the room, and leaving\r\nit there for twenty-four hours, carefully closing the windows and doors.\r\nAt the end of the twenty-four hours the lime should be reweighed, and if\r\nthe increase exceeds one per cent. of the original weight, it is not safe\r\nto live in the room.\r\n\r\nDecay of timber will arise from the effects of continued dryness or\r\ncontinued wetness, under certain conditions; or it may also arise from\r\nthe effect of alternate dryness and moisture, or continued moisture with\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nAt one time dry rot appears to have made great havoc amongst the wooden\r\nships of the British Navy. In the Memoirs of Pepys, who was Secretary to\r\nthe Admiralty during the reigns of Charles II. and James II., reference\r\nis made to a Commission which was appointed to inquire into the state of\r\nthe navy, and from which it appears that thirty ships, called new ships,\r\n“for want of proper care and attention, had toadstools growing in their\r\nholds as big as one’s fists, and were in so complete a state of decay,\r\nthat some of the planks had dropped from their sides.”\r\n\r\nIn the ‘European Magazine’ for December, 1811, it is stated that, “about\r\n1798, there was, at Woolwich, a ship in so bad a state that the deck\r\nsunk with a man’s weight, and the orange and brown coloured fungi were\r\nhanging, in the shape of inverted cones, from deck to deck.”\r\n\r\nMr. William Chapman, in his ‘Preservation of Timber from Premature\r\nDecay,’ &c., gives several instances of the rapid decay of the ships\r\nof the Royal Navy, about the commencement of the present century. He\r\nmentions three ships of 74 guns each, decayed in five years; three of\r\n74 guns each, decayed in seven years; and one of 100 guns, decayed in\r\nsix years. Mr. Pering, also, in his ‘Brief Enquiry into the Causes of\r\nPremature Decay,’ &c., says that ships of war are useless in five or\r\nsix years; and he estimates the average duration to be eight years, and\r\nthat the cost of the hull alone of a three-decker was nearly 100,000_l._\r\nMr. Pering was formerly at the dockyard, Plymouth, and therefore a good\r\nauthority, if he availed himself of the opportunities of studying the\r\nsubject. He has stated that he has seen fungi growing so strong betwixt\r\nthe timbers in a man-of-war, as to force a plank from the ship’s side\r\nhalf an inch.\r\n\r\nNo doubt a great deal of this decay was attributable to the use of\r\nunseasoned timber, and defective ventilation; but there is too much\r\nreason to believe that it was principally owing to the introduction\r\nof an inferior species of oak (_Quercus sessiliflora_) into the naval\r\ndockyards, where, we imagine, the distinction was not even suspected. The\r\ntrue old English oak (_Quercus robur_) affords a close-grained, firm,\r\nsolid timber, rarely subject to rot; the other is more loose and sappy,\r\nvery liable to rot, and not half so durable.\r\n\r\nOne cause of the decay of wood in ships is the use of wooden treenails.\r\nA treenail is a piece of cleft wood (made round), from 1 foot to 3\r\nfeet 6 inches in length and 1½ inch in diameter. As the treenails are\r\nalso made to drive easy, they never fill the holes they are driven\r\ninto; consequently, if ever it admits water at the outer end, which,\r\nfrom shrinking, it is liable to do, that water immediately gets into\r\nthe middle of the plank, and thereby forms a natural vehicle for the\r\nconveyance of water. The treenail is also the second thing which decays\r\nin a ship, the first, generally, being the oakum. Should any part of\r\nthe plank or timbers of a ship be in an incipient state of decay, and a\r\ntreenail come in contact with it, the decay immediately increases, while\r\nevery treenail shares the same fate, and the natural consequence is, the\r\nship is soon left without a fastening. Treenails in a warm country are\r\nsure to shrink and admit water.\r\n\r\nMr. Fincham, formerly Principal Builder in Her Majesty’s dockyard,\r\nChatham, considers that the destruction of timber by the decay commonly\r\nknown as dry rot, cannot occur unless air, (?) moisture, and heat are\r\nall present, and that the entire exclusion of any of the three stays the\r\nmischief. By way of experiment, he bored a hole in one of the timbers of\r\nan old ship built of oak, whose wood was at the time perfectly sound;\r\nthe admission of air, the third element, to the central part of the wood\r\n(the two others being to a certain degree present) caused the hole to be\r\nfilled up in the course of twenty-four hours with mouldiness, which very\r\nspeedily became so compact as to admit of being withdrawn like a stick.\r\n\r\nThe confinement of timber under most circumstances is attended with the\r\nworst consequences, yet a partial ventilation tends to fan the flame of\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\nThe admission of air has long been considered the only means of\r\ndestroying the fungus, but as it has frequently proved ineffectual, it\r\nmust not be always taken as a certain remedy. If dry air be properly\r\nadmitted, in a quantity adequate to absorb the moisture, it will\r\nnecessarily exhaust and destroy the fungus; but care should be taken lest\r\nthe air should be conveyed into other parts of the building, for, after\r\ndisengaging itself from the fungus over which it has passed, it carries\r\nwith it innumerable seeds of the disease, and destroys everything which\r\noffers a bar to its progress. Air, in passing through damps, will partake\r\nof their humidity; it therefore soon becomes inadequate to the task for\r\nwhich it is designed. Owing to this circumstance, air has been frequently\r\nadmitted into the affected parts of a building without any ultimate\r\nsuccess; too often, instead of injuring the fungus, it has considerably\r\nassisted its vegetation, and infected with the disease other parts of the\r\nbuilding, which would otherwise probably have remained without injury.\r\nThe timber, which is in a state of decomposition by an intestinal decay,\r\nis little affected by the application of air, as this cannot penetrate\r\nthe surrounding spongeous rottenness which generally forms the exterior\r\nof such timber, and protects the action which the humid particles have\r\nacquired in the exterior: as the extent and progress of the disease\r\nis therefore necessarily concealed, it is difficult to ascertain\r\ncorrectly the effect produced by the admission of dry air. Under these\r\ncircumstances of necessity and danger, it will require considerable\r\nskill to effect the purpose without increasing the disease, and, as each\r\ncase has its own peculiar characteristics, it is necessary before one\r\nattempts to admit air as a remedy, to previously estimate the destructive\r\nconsequences which may result from so doing, and ascertain whether it\r\nwill be injurious or beneficial to the building. The joists of the houses\r\nbuilt by our ancestors last almost for ever, because they are in contact\r\nwith an air which is continually changing. Now, on the contrary, we\r\nfoolishly enclose them between a ceiling of plaster (always very damp to\r\nbegin with) and a floor; they frequently decay, and then cause the most\r\nserious disasters, of which it is impossible to be forewarned.\r\n\r\nDamp, combined with warmth, is as a destroying agent, still more active\r\nthan simple damp alone--the heat being understood as insufficient to\r\ncarry off the moisture by evaporation; and the higher the temperature\r\nwith a corresponding degree of moisture, the more rapid the decay. If\r\nthe temperature to which wood is exposed, whilst any sap remains in\r\nit, is too elevated, the vegetable fluids ferment; the tenacity is\r\ndiminished, and when the action is carried to its full extent, the wood\r\nquickly becomes affected by the dry rot. Exposure to the atmosphere in\r\npositions where rain can lodge in quantity, contact with the ground, and\r\napplication in damp situations deprived of air, will render wood liable\r\nto the wet rot; and however well seasoned it may have been previously\r\nto being brought within the influence of any of these causes, it will\r\ninfallibly suffer. Air should therefore have free access to the wood in\r\nevery direction:\r\n\r\n    … “for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests\r\n    round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls\r\n    of the house.”--1 Kings vi. 6.\r\n\r\nRondelet says, “The woodwork of the church of St. Paul, outside the city\r\nwalls, which was destroyed by fire in 1823, was erected as far back as\r\nthe fifth century.” Although the atmosphere surrounding the framework\r\nwas often at once warm and damp, yet it was never stagnant. It should be\r\nremembered that 500 people in a church during two hours give off fifteen\r\ngallons of water into the air, which, if not carried away, saturates\r\neverything in the building after it has been breathed over and over\r\nagain in conjunction with the impurities it contains collected from each\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nFever, scrofula, and consumption arise in many instances from defective\r\nventilation.\r\n\r\nThe signs of decay in timber are, as has been stated, fungi. Some of them\r\nnow and then are microscopic, and owe their existence to the sporules\r\ndeposited on the surface; while fermentation, generated by prolonged\r\ncontact with warm, damp, and stagnant air, is as a soil where seeds sow\r\nand nourish themselves.\r\n\r\nMr. McWilliam, in his work on dry rot, states that if the temperature\r\nbe very low or very high, the effects are the same with respect to the\r\ngrowth of fungi. At 80° dry rot will proceed rapidly, at 90° its progress\r\nis more slow; at 100° it is slower still, and from 110° to 120° it will\r\nin general be arrested. It will proceed fast at 50°; it may be generated\r\nat 40°; its progress will be slow at 36°; and is arrested at 32°, yet it\r\nwill return if the temperature is raised to 50°.\r\n\r\nDry rot externally first makes its appearance as a mildew, or rather\r\na delicate white vegetation, that looks like such. The next step is a\r\ncollecting together of the fibres of the vegetation into a more decided\r\nform, somewhat like hoar frost; after which it speedily assumes the\r\nleathery, compact character of the fungus, forming into leaves, spreading\r\nrapidly in all directions, and over all materials, and frequently\r\nascending the walls to a considerable height, the colour variable--white,\r\ngreyish white, and violet, light or decided brown, &c.\r\n\r\nIn the section of a piece of wood attacked by dry rot a microscope\r\nreveals minute white threads spreading and ramifying throughout its\r\nsubstance; these interlace and become matted together into a white\r\ncottony texture, resembling lint, which effuses itself over the surface\r\nof the timber; then in the centre of each considerable mass a gelatinous\r\nsubstance forms, which becomes gradually of a yellow, tawny hue, and a\r\nwrinkled, sinuated porous consistence, shedding a red powder (the spores)\r\nupon a white down; this is the resupinate pileus, the hymenium being\r\nupwards, of _Merulius lachrymans_, in its perfect and matured state. Long\r\nbefore it attains to this, the whole interior of the wood on which it\r\nis situated has perished; the sap vessels being gradually filled by the\r\ncottony filaments of the fungus; no sooner do these appear externally\r\nthan examination proves that the apparently solid beam may be crumbled\r\nto dust between the fingers; tenacity and weight are annihilated.\r\n\r\nDr. Haller says that seven parts in eight of a fungus in full vegetation\r\nare found by analysis to be completely aqueous.\r\n\r\nThe strength of fungi is proportionate to the strength of the timber the\r\ncohesive powers and nutritive juices of which they absorb; and according\r\nto the food they receive so they are varied and modified in different\r\nways, and are not always alike. Different stages of corruption produce\r\nfood of different qualities, and hence many of the different appearances\r\nof fungi. One takes the process of corruption up where another leaves it\r\noff, and carries it forward and farther forward to positive putrefaction.\r\n\r\nThe forms which fungi assume are extremely diversified; in some instances\r\nwe have a distinct stem supporting a cap, and looking somewhat like a\r\nparasol; in others the stem is entirely absent, and the cap is attached\r\neither by its margin, and is said to be _dimidiate_, or by its back,\r\nor that which is more commonly its upper surface, when it is called\r\n_resupinate_. In some species the form is that of a cup, in others of\r\na goblet, a saucer, an ear, a bird’s nest, a horn, a bunch of coral, a\r\nball, a button, a rosette, a lump of jelly, or a piece of velvet.\r\n\r\nDecomposition takes place without fungus where the timber and the\r\nsituation are always moist, as in a close-boarded kitchen floor, where\r\nit is always dry, or very nearly so, and where it is alternately wet\r\nand dry, cold and hot. When the decomposition is affected with very\r\nlittle moisture, and no fungus, the admission of air will generally\r\nprevent further contamination; but where there is abundance of moisture,\r\nrottenness, and fungus, a small quantity of air will hasten the\r\ndestruction of the building.\r\n\r\nIn timber which has been only superficially seasoned this disease is\r\nproduced internally, and has been known to convert the entire substance\r\nof a beam, excepting only the external inch or two of thickness to\r\nwhich the seasoning had penetrated, into a fine, white, and threadlike\r\nvegetation, uniting in a thick fungous coat at the ends, the semblance\r\nbeing that of a perfectly sound beam. In this internal rot a spongy\r\nfungous substance is formed between the fibres. This has often been\r\nobserved in large girders of yellow fir, which have appeared sound on\r\nthe outside, but by removing some of the binding joists have been found\r\ncompletely rotten at the heart. An instance of this kind occurred at\r\nKenwood (the seat of the Earl of Mansfield) in 1815. Major Jones, R.E.,\r\nstates that on one occasion he was called upon to report on the state of\r\na building in Malta; that the timbers had every external appearance of\r\nbeing sound, but on being bored with an auger they were found internally\r\nin a total state of decay. It is on this account that the practice of\r\nsawing and bolting beams is recommended, for when timber is large enough\r\nto be laid open in the centre this part is laid open to season; so that\r\nwhen a tree is large enough to be cut through to make two or more beams,\r\ndecomposition is impeded.\r\n\r\nThe first symptoms of rottenness in timber are swelling, discoloration,\r\nand mouldiness, accompanied with a musty smell; in its greater advance\r\nthe fibres are found to shrink lengthways and break, presenting many deep\r\nfissures across the wood; the fibres crumble readily to a fine snuff-like\r\npowder, but retain, when undisturbed, much of their natural appearance.\r\n\r\nIn whatever way boughs are removed from trees, the effect of their\r\nremoval is, however, very frequently to produce a rotting of the inner\r\nwood, which indicates itself externally by a sudden abnormal swelling of\r\nthe trunk a little above the root; sometimes the trunk becomes hollow at\r\nthe part affected, and this particular description of rot will almost\r\ninvariably be found to exist in those trees whose roots are much exposed.\r\nThe rot itself is either of a red, black, or white colour in the timber\r\nwhen felled, and when either of the two last-named colours prevail, it\r\nwill be found that the decay does not extend very far into the tree;\r\nbut if, on the contrary, the colour of the parts most visibly affected\r\nshould be decidedly red, the wood should be rejected for any building\r\npurposes. Sometimes small brown spots, indicative of a commencement of\r\ndecay, may be observed near the butt or root end of trees, and though\r\nthey do not appear to be connected with any serious immediate danger to\r\nthe durability of the wood, it is advisable to employ the material so\r\naffected only in positions where it would not be confined in anything\r\nlike a close, damp atmosphere.\r\n\r\nGreat hesitation may be admitted as to the use of timber which presents\r\nlarge bands of what are supposed to be indefinitely-marked annual\r\ngrowth, because the existence of zones of wood so affected may be\r\nconsidered to indicate that the tree was not in a healthy state when they\r\nwere formed, and that the wood then secreted lacked some of the elements\r\nrequired for its durability, upon being subsequently exposed to the\r\nordinary causes of decay.\r\n\r\nIn many cases when timber trees are cut down and converted for use, it\r\nis found that at the junction of some of the minor branches with the\r\nmain stem, the roots, as it were, of the branches traverse the surface\r\nwood in the form of knots, and that they often assume a commencement of\r\ndecay, which in the course of time will extend to the wood around them.\r\nThis decay seems to have arisen in the majority of cases from the sudden\r\ndisruption of the branch close to its roots, with an irregular fracture,\r\nand with such depressions below the surface as to allow the sap to\r\naccumulate, or atmospheric moisture to lodge in them. A decomposition of\r\nthe sap takes place--in fact, a wound is made in the tree-and what are\r\ncalled “druxy knots” are thus formed, which have a contagious action on\r\nthe healthy wood near them.\r\n\r\nThere is this particular danger about the dry rot; viz. that the germs\r\nof the fungi producing it are carried easily, and in all directions, in\r\na building wherein it once displays itself, without necessity for actual\r\ncontact between the affected or the sound wood; whereas the communication\r\nof the disease resulting from the putrefactive fermentation, or the wet\r\nrot, only takes place by actual contact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Timber Beams,--rotten at the heart._]\r\n\r\nBefore dry rot has time to destroy the principal timbers in a building,\r\nit penetrates behind the skirtings, dadoes, and wainscotings, drawing\r\nin the edges of the boards, and splitting them both horizontally and\r\nvertically. When the fungus is taken off, they exhibit an appearance\r\nsimilar both in back and front to wood which has been charred; a light\r\npressure with the hand will break them asunder, even though affected with\r\nthe rot but a short time; and in taking down the wainscot, the fibrous\r\nand thin-coated fungus will generally be seen closely attached to the\r\ndecayed wood. In timber of moderate length the fungus becomes larger and\r\nmore destructive, in consequence of the matter congenial to its growth\r\naffording a more plentiful supply.\r\n\r\nIt is a great characteristic of fungi in general that they are very\r\nrapid in growth, and rapid in decay. In a night a puff-ball will grow\r\nprodigiously, and in the same short period a mass of paste may be covered\r\nwith mould. In a few hours a gelatinous mass of _Reticularia_ will pass\r\ninto a bladder of dust, or a _Coprinus_ will be dripping into decay. Many\r\ninstances have been recorded of the rapidity of growth in fungi; it may\r\nalso be accepted as an axiom that they are in many instances equally as\r\nrapid in decay.\r\n\r\nIn considering the liability of any particular description of foreign\r\ntimber to take the dry rot, attention must be paid to the circumstances\r\nunder which it is imported. Sometimes the timber is a long while coming\r\nhere, whilst at other times it is imported in a very short period. The\r\nlength of time consumed in the voyage has a great deal to do with its\r\nlikelihood of taking the rot: it may have a very favourable passage, or\r\na very wet one, and the ship is frequently, in some degree, affected\r\nwith the disease. It perhaps begins in the ship, and it may often be\r\nseen between the timber or deals, when it will impregnate the wood to a\r\ngreat depth. Whether it is inherent in the timber or not, of this we may\r\nbe certain, that where there is a fetid atmosphere it is sure to grow.\r\nCanadian yellow wood pine timber is more subject to rot than Baltic or\r\nCanadian red wood timber, although the latter will sometimes decay in\r\nfour or five years. Turpentine is a preventive against dry rot, and\r\nCanadian timber is sometimes largely impregnated with it, especially the\r\nred wood timber; the yellow wood is very subject to dry rot. Very few\r\ncargoes of timber in the log arrive from Canada in which in one part or\r\nother of nearly every log you will not see a beginning of the vegetation\r\nof the rot. Sometimes it will show itself only by a few reddish,\r\ndiscoloured spots, which, when scratched by the finger nail to the extent\r\nof each spot, it will be seen that the texture of the timber to some\r\nlittle depth is destroyed, and will be reduced to powder; and on these\r\nspots a white fibre may generally be seen growing. If the timber has been\r\nshipped in a dry condition, and the voyage has been a short one, there\r\nmay be a few logs without a spot; but generally speaking very few cargoes\r\narrive from Canada in which there are many logs of timber not affected.\r\nBut if the cargo has been shipped in a wet condition, and the voyage has\r\nbeen a long one, then a white fibre will be seen growing over nearly\r\nevery part of the surface of every log; and in cargoes that have been so\r\nshipped, all the logs of yellow pine, red pine, and of oak, are generally\r\nmore or less affected on the surface.\r\n\r\nNearly every deal of yellow pine that has been shipped in Canada in a\r\nwet state, when it arrives here is also covered over with a network of\r\nlittle white fibres, which are the dry rot in its incipient state. There\r\nis no cargo, even that which is shipped in tolerably dry condition, in\r\nwhich, upon its arriving here, may not be found some deals, with the\r\nfungus beginning to vegetate on their surface. If they are deals that\r\nhave been floated down the rivers of America or Canada, and shipped in a\r\nwet state, on their arrival here they are so covered with this network\r\nof the fungus, that force is often necessary to separate one deal from\r\nanother, so strongly does the fungus occasion them to adhere. They grow\r\ntogether again, as it were, after quitting the ship, while lying in the\r\nbarges, before being landed. Accordingly, if a cargo has arrived in a wet\r\ncondition, or late in the year, or if the rain falls on the deals before\r\nthey are landed, and they are then piled in the way in which Norwegian\r\nand Swedish deals are piled, that is, flatways, in six months time, or\r\neven less, the whole pile of deals become deeply affected with rot; so\r\nthat, whenever a flat surface of one deal is upon the flat surface of\r\nanother, the rot penetrates to the depth of ⅛ of an inch. Its progress\r\nis then arrested by repiling the deals during very dry weather, and by\r\nsweeping the surface of each deal before it is repiled: but the best way\r\nis to pile the deals in the first instance upon their edges; by which\r\nmeans the air circulates freely around them, the growth of the fungus\r\nis arrested, and the necessity of repiling them prevented. If the ship\r\nis built of good, sound, and well-seasoned oak, the rot would perhaps\r\nnot affect it, but in order to prevent its doing so, the precaution is\r\nusually taken to scrape the surface as soon as the hold is clear of the\r\ncargo of timber. Were the cargo not cleared, and the hold not ventilated,\r\na ship that was permanently exposed to this fungus would, no doubt, be\r\naffected. It is easy, however, to prevent its extending by washing the\r\nhold with any desiccating solution.\r\n\r\nAnyone who wishes to know how timber is occasionally shipped to this\r\ncountry should read the report of a trial, in the ‘Times,’ 22nd Feb.,\r\n1875 (Harrison _v._ Willis), relative to a cargo of pitch pine shipped\r\nfrom Sapelo, in the Isthmus of Darien, for Liverpool. This cargo,\r\nhowever, never arrived at Liverpool: it was lost at sea.\r\n\r\nThe motto of the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights is, “Within the ark,\r\nsafe for ever.” We suggest it should be altered to, “Within the ark\r\n_which is free from dry rot_, safe for ever.”\r\n\r\nThere are two descriptions of European deals very liable to take the dry\r\nrot; viz. yellow Petersburgh deals, and yellow and white battens, from\r\nDram, in Norway. When Dram battens, which have been lying a long time in\r\nbond in this country, have not been repiled in time, they have been found\r\nas much affected with the dry rot as many Canadian deals; though this has\r\nnot happened in so short a time as has been sufficient to rot Canadian\r\ndeals. The fungus growing on the Petersburgh deals and Dram battens\r\nhas all the characteristics and effects of dry rot as exhibited in the\r\nCanadian deals, the detection of dry rot being in most cases the same.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that white deal absorbs more water than yellow;\r\nand yellow more water than red; and the quantity of water absorbed by\r\nthe white accounts for its more rapid decay in external situations; as\r\nthe greater the quantity of water absorbed the quicker is the timber\r\ndestroyed. Mr. John Lingard, in his work on timber (1842), states that he\r\nhas proved that 4½ oz. of water can be driven off from a small piece of\r\nfir, weighing only 10 oz. when wet, which is nearly half. This timber was\r\non a saw-pit, and going to be put into a building.\r\n\r\nThe most general, and the most fatal cause of decay, viz. the wet rot,\r\nhas attracted less attention than the more startling, but less common\r\nevils, the dry rot, and the destruction by insects.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Deane, in 1849, related before the Institution of Civil\r\nEngineers of Ireland, an extraordinary instance of the rapid decay of\r\ntimber from rot, which occurred in the church of the Holy Trinity at Cork.\r\n\r\nOn opening the floors under the pews, a most extraordinary appearance\r\npresented itself. There were flat fungi of immense size and thickness,\r\nsome so large as almost to occupy a space equal to the size of a pew,\r\nand from 1 to 3 inches thick. In other places fungi appeared, growing\r\nwith the ordinary dry rot, some of an unusual shape, in form like a\r\nconvolvulus, with stems of from a quarter to half an inch in diameter.\r\nWhen first exposed, the whole was of a beautiful buff colour, and emitted\r\nthe usual smell of the dry-rot fungus.\r\n\r\nDuring a great part of the time occupied in the repairs of the church,\r\nthe weather was very rainy. The arches of the vaults having been turned\r\nbefore the roof was slated, the rain water saturated the partly decayed\r\noak beams. The flooring and joists, composed of fresh timber, were laid\r\non the vaulting before it was dry, coming in contact at the same time\r\nwith the old oak timber, which was abundantly supplied with the seeds of\r\ndecay, stimulated by moisture, the bad atmosphere of an ill-contrived\r\nburial-place, and afterwards by heat from the stoves constantly in use.\r\nAll these circumstances account satisfactorily for the extraordinary and\r\nrapid growth of the fungi.\r\n\r\nMany instances might be mentioned of English oak being affected with\r\ndry rot, under particular circumstances. There was a great deal at the\r\nDuke of Devonshire’s, at Chiswick, about 60 years ago. Needy builders,\r\nwho work for contract, sometimes use American oak, and call it wainscot:\r\nit is a bad substitute for wainscot, being very liable to warp and to\r\nbe affected with dry rot. “I know of one public building,” observed the\r\nlate Mr. Henry Warburton, M.P., “in which it has been introduced, and, I\r\nsuppose, paid for under that name.”\r\n\r\nAnother serious instance of the decay of timber from rot occurred some\r\ntime since in Old St. Pancras Church, London. When the dry rot made its\r\nappearance, it spread with amazing rapidity. Sometimes in the course of a\r\nnight, a fungus of about the consistence of newly-fallen snow, and of a\r\nyellowish-white unwholesome colour, would be found to have spread over a\r\nconsiderable surface. The fungus was without shape, but in some cases it\r\nrose to a height of 2, 3, or 4 inches above the planks or other surfaces\r\non which it grew. It could be cut with a knife, leaving a clear edge on\r\neach side, and there did not seem to be any covering or membrane over\r\nthe outer or under surface. The smell of those matters was unpleasant,\r\nand seemed like the concentration of the smell which had pervaded the\r\nchurch for so long a time before; and, in a short time, beams, planks of\r\nflooring, railings, &c., were reduced to rottenness: the colour changed,\r\nand a heavy dark-brown dust fell, and represented the once solid timber.\r\nOn making an examination with a view of discovering the cause of the\r\nattack, it was found that in the graveyard, near the church, there were\r\ngraves, and several vaults: there were also vaults in the inside of the\r\nchurch. Most of them were filled, or nearly so, with water, which had run\r\nfrom the overcrowded graves.\r\n\r\nIn the interior there were water-logged vaults, and the walls were\r\nsaturated with damp. It was also seen that from want of proper spouts\r\nand drains, near the outer walls, the drip from the large pent roof had\r\nfallen into the foundations. In this situation, when the window frames\r\nwere properly arranged, a drain dug round and from parts of the church,\r\nand other alterations, which should long before have been made, were\r\ncompleted, the dry rot vanished, and no more complaints of the foulness\r\nof the air have since been heard.\r\n\r\nWe could quote many cases of rot which have been caused from the want of\r\nproper drains and spouts. Architects should remember that the feet of\r\nGothic collar roofs have to bear the whole weight of the roof, and unless\r\nwell seasoned, and carefully protected from damp, leaks, &c., premature\r\ndecay and dry rot will be sure to occur. It is surprising what injury\r\nleaks from gutters will sometimes do. In 1851, Professor T. L. Donaldson\r\nstated that “a brestsummer of American timber was used some time since\r\nat a house in London: after an expiration of three years cracks began to\r\nappear in the front wall. A friend of mine, an architect, was called in\r\nto find out the cause; and after examining different parts of the house,\r\nwas almost giving up his search in despair, when he thought he would have\r\nthe shop cornice removed and look at the brestsummer. He then discovered\r\nthat some water had been admitted by accident, and penetrating the\r\nbrestsummer, had caused it to rot, and crack the wall.”\r\n\r\nDry rot was found in the great dome of the Bank of England, London, as\r\noriginally built by Sir Robert Taylor: it also existed in the Society of\r\nArts building, in the Adelphi, London. It was also found in the domes of\r\nthe Panthéon, and Halle-au-Blé, Paris; but we hope there is no dry rot in\r\nthe dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral, London, which is constructed entirely\r\nof timber, covered externally with lead.\r\n\r\nThe decayed state of a barn floor attacked by rot is thus described by\r\nMr. B. Johnson: “An oak barn floor which had been laid twelve years began\r\nto shake upon the joists, and on examination was found to be quite rotten\r\nin various parts. The planks, 2½ inches in thickness, were nearly eaten\r\nthrough, except the outsides, which were glossy, and apparently without\r\nblemish. The rotten wood was partly in the state of an impalpable powder,\r\nof a snuff colour; other parts were black, and the rest clearly fungus.\r\nNo earth was near the wood.” This oak was probably of the _Quercus\r\nsessiliflora_ species; and there was no ventilation to the floor.\r\n\r\nMr. John Armstrong, carpenter, employed for many years at Windsor Castle,\r\nobserved: “I was employed a few years back at a house where I found a\r\nfloor rotten. We took it up; it was yellow pine; it was laid in the\r\ndamp, but on sleepers, and the sleepers were not rotten: they were of a\r\ndifferent description of wood.” Probably the sleepers were of Baltic red\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter relates an instance of the expansive power resulting\r\nfrom the rapid growth of the soft cellular tissue of fungi. About the\r\ncommencement of this century the town of Basingstoke was paved; and not\r\nmany months afterwards the pavement was observed to exhibit an unevenness\r\nwhich could not easily be accounted for. In a short time after, the\r\nmystery was explained, for some of the heaviest stones were completely\r\nlifted out of their beds by the growth of large toadstools beneath them.\r\nOne of these stones measured 22 inches by 21 inches, and weighed 83 lb.,\r\nand the resistance afforded by the mortar which held it in its place\r\nwould probably be even a greater obstacle than the weight. A similar\r\nincident came under the notice of Mr. M. C. Cooke (the author of ‘British\r\nFungi’), of a large kitchen hearthstone which was forced up from its bed\r\nby an under-growing fungus, and had to be relaid two or three times,\r\nuntil at last it reposed in peace, the old bed having been removed\r\nto the depth of 6 inches, and a new foundation laid. A circumstance\r\nrecorded by Sir Joseph Banks is still more extraordinary, of a cask of\r\nwine which, having been confined for three years in a cellar, was, at\r\nthe termination of that period, found to have leaked from the cask, and\r\nvegetated in the form of immense fungi, which had filled the cellar, and\r\nborne upwards the empty wine cask.\r\n\r\nTimber decay in contact with stone is a subject deserving consideration.\r\nThis decay is entirely obviated by inserting the wood in an iron shoe,\r\nor by placing a thin piece of iron between the wood and the stone. It is\r\nsaid that a hard crust is formed on the timber in contact with the iron,\r\nwhich seems effectually to preserve it; it is, of course, necessary that\r\na free circulation of air round the ends of the timber be provided. The\r\nmost notable instance of timber decay in contact with stone with which we\r\nare acquainted occurred at the coronation of George IV. Westminster Hall\r\nwas then fitted up, and they began by laying sleepers of yellow pine. The\r\ncoronation was suspended for twelve months, and when the sleepers were\r\ntaken up from the floor of Westminster Hall, they were in a rotten state.\r\n\r\nTimber in contact with brickwork is in Suffolk and in some parts of\r\nEngland covered with sheet lead to preserve it from the effects of the\r\ndamp mortar. Fungi will arise in mortar, if made with road-drift, and\r\nwater from stagnant ponds, &c., and it may be traced through the mortar\r\njoints, and will thus appear on both sides of a wall. Mortar composed of\r\nunwashed sand will generate fungi; sea sand, even if washed, should never\r\nbe used. It is considered that the system of grouting contributes to the\r\nearly decay of timber; wood bond timber for walls has been consequently\r\nreplaced by hoop iron bond. In Manchester wood bond is frequently used,\r\nand is said to answer well, but the high temperature of the buildings may\r\nbe a preventive against the decay of timber, as the walls are soon dried.\r\nThe practice is a bad one.\r\n\r\nWhen timber used as posts inserted in the ground is placed in the\r\ninverted position to that in which it stood when growing, it is said\r\nto be very much more durable than if placed in its natural or growing\r\nposition. This is easily accounted for in the valves of the sap vessels\r\nof the growing timber opening upwards; but when that position is\r\ninverted, the valves of the sap vessels become reversed in their action;\r\nand, therefore, when timber is used as posts inserted in the ground, the\r\nvalves being so reversed prevent the ascent of moisture from the soil in\r\nthe wood. Mr. W. Howe relates an experiment made to test the comparative\r\ndurability of posts set as they grew. He says, “Sixteen years ago I set\r\nsix pairs of bar posts all split out of the butt end of the same white\r\noak log. One pair I set butts down; another pair, one butt down, the\r\nother top down; the others top down. Four years ago those set butt down\r\nwere all rotted off, and had to be replaced by new ones. This summer I\r\nhad occasion to reset those that were set top down: I found them all\r\nsound enough to reset. My experiments have convinced me that the best\r\nway is to set them tops down.” Other instances might be given in favour\r\nof placing posts in an inverted position in the ground. Posts will\r\nsometimes decay, for the following reason: The ends are often sawn off\r\nwith a coarse implement and left spongy, with the longitudinal fibres\r\nshaken or broken a considerable way within the extremity of the wood. In\r\nthis state the ends of the posts must be apt to absorb from the ground\r\nthe moisture, which, being retained, and speedily pervading the whole\r\ninternal surface, _especially if painted_, appears to cause decay.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the preservation of wooden fences, Mr. Cruikshank, of\r\nMarcassie, gives in detail various experiments from which it appears\r\nthat--1st. When larch or pine wood is to be exposed to the weather, or\r\nto be put in the ground, no bark should be left on. 2nd. When posts are\r\nto be put in the ground, no earth should be put round them, but stones.\r\n3rd. When a wooden fence is to be put up, a No. 4 or No. 5 wire should be\r\nstretched in place of, or alongside the upper rail.\r\n\r\nMr. G. S. Hartig, in the ‘Revue Horticole,’ gives the results of\r\nexperiments made with great care and patience, upon woods buried\r\nin the earth. Pieces of wood of various kinds 3⅛th inches square,\r\nwere buried about one inch below the surface of the ground, and they\r\ndecayed in the following order: the lime, American birch, alder,\r\nand the trembling-leaved poplar, in three years; the common willow,\r\nhorse-chestnut, and plane, in four years; the maple, red beech, and\r\ncommon birch, in five years; the elm, ash, hornbeam, and Lombardy\r\npoplar, in six years; the oak, Scotch fir, Weymouth pine, and silver\r\nfir, were only decayed to the depth of half an inch in seven years;\r\nthe larch, common juniper, red cedar, and arbor vitæ, at the end of\r\nthe last-mentioned period remained uninjured. The duration of their\r\nrespective woods greatly depends on their age and quality; specimens from\r\nyoung trees decaying much quicker than those from sound old trees; and,\r\nwhen well seasoned, they, of course, last much longer than when buried in\r\nan unseasoned state. In experiments with the woods cut into thin boards,\r\ndecay proceeded in the following order: the plane, horse-chestnut,\r\npoplar, American birch, red beech, hornbeam, alder, ash, maple, silver\r\nfir, Scotch fir, elm, Weymouth pine, larch, locust oak.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the subject of decay of timber when buried in the earth,\r\nit will not be out of place to allude to the decay of railway sleepers,\r\ntaking for example those in India: English and American sleepers will be\r\ndealt with more in detail hereafter.\r\n\r\nDr. Cleghorn, Conservator of Forests, Madras Presidency, India, considers\r\nthe decay of sleepers to arise in a great measure from the inferior\r\ndescription of wood used. Mr. Bryce McMaster, Resident Engineer,\r\nSalem, considers that the native wood sleepers in India have hitherto\r\nbeen found for the most part to fail on the Madras Railway, between\r\n30 and 40 per cent. requiring to be renewed annually. Mr. McMaster\r\nundertook an investigation with a view of ascertaining the causes of\r\nthis deterioration, and whether those causes could be overcome so as to\r\nrender available the vast resources of India. Thirteen hundred sleepers\r\nof sixteen different woods were submitted to careful examination and\r\nscrutiny twice at an interval of one year. The sleepers were variously\r\nplaced, both on embankments and in cuttings; in some cases they were\r\nentirely covered with ballast to a depth of 4 inches; while in others\r\nthey were as much as possible uncovered, and completely so from the rails\r\nto the ends--the ballast being only raised 2 inches in the middle of\r\nthe way, and sloped off so as to carry away the water under the rails.\r\nFrom these observations it appeared that only five woods, Chella wungé,\r\nKara mardá, Palai, Karúvalem, and Ilupé, were sound at the end of two\r\nyears, the other eleven not lasting even that time. Also, that when the\r\nsleepers were uncovered, decay was less rapid than when they were buried\r\nin the ballast. The plan of leaving the sleepers partially uncovered had\r\nmany advantages; it effected a saving of the ballast, allowed the defects\r\nto be more quickly detected, and kept the sleepers drier. It had been\r\nurged that the heat of the sun would split the sleepers and cause the\r\nkeys and treenails to shrink; but from experience it was found that while\r\namong the “uncovered” sleepers there was a large proportion “beginning\r\nto split,” or “useless from being split,” there was on the other hand,\r\namong the “covered” sleepers, a still larger proportion “beginning to\r\nrot,” or “useless from being rotten.” It was also noticed that of the\r\nsleepers “beginning to rot,” 19 per cent. had commenced under one or\r\nboth chairs. This was due to the retention of moisture under them, and\r\nmight be remedied by tarring the seats of the chairs. As regarded the\r\ntreenails where the sleepers were rotten, the treenails were invariably\r\nfound to be in the same state; while, when the heads were exposed to the\r\nsun, they were not loosened by shrinking. Another objection was, that the\r\nroad would be more likely to buckle and twist, but this was not found in\r\npractice to be the case. Treenails made in India cost 2_l._ 10_s._ to\r\n4_l._ per 1000, and the woods generally used for the purpose are Vengé,\r\nKara mardá, Erul, Porasa, or satin wood, and Trincomalee. The three\r\nwoods first named are also extensively employed for keys, but teak keys\r\nseem to be the best, and their cost does not exceed 6_l._ per 1000. From\r\nthe experience of the Indian engineers it appears that Teak, Saul, Sisso,\r\nPedowk, Kara mardá, Acha, Vengé, Chella wungé, Palai, Erul, Karúvalem,\r\nwill make very good sleepers to be used plain.\r\n\r\nThe sleepers which have failed on the Madras Railway might well be\r\ndivided into two classes,--those which were originally of perishable\r\nwoods, and were therefore unfit for the purpose; and those which although\r\nof good wood had been cut from young trees, and not been allowed to\r\nstand until old enough. The first arose from want of experience of the\r\nnature of Indian woods: the second from the absence of a proper system of\r\nworking the jungles.\r\n\r\nThe wooden sleepers on the Indian railways should be tarred under the\r\nseats of the chairs, be laid in dry ballast, and raised slightly in the\r\nmiddle, and sloped off so as to throw the water under the rails. About\r\ntwo-thirds of the Indian woods are practically useless owing to the want\r\nof proper artificial means for preserving those of a perishable nature.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the decay of wood in India and tropical climates is too\r\nextensive to be further considered here; but is of sufficient importance\r\nto demand a volume to itself; the renewal of decayed wooden sleepers\r\nto railways forming annually a most important item in foreign railway\r\nbudgets.\r\n\r\nWe have heard that some of our fortifications which have been erected\r\nwithin the last few years to protect our English coast from invasion,\r\nhave already been invaded by dry rot. If this be true, some one well\r\nacquainted with the subject should at once be appointed to find out the\r\ncause, and recommend the remedy in each case.\r\n\r\nProfessional men, if they wish their works to “live for ever,” should\r\nconsider the after consequences of neglecting to provide against dry\r\nrot. If the fungi could speak from under floors, ceiled-up roofs, behind\r\nwainscots, girders, &c., we should often hear them exclaim, “A nice moist\r\npiece of wood! Surely this belongs to us.” On the beams of a building at\r\nCrawley, a carpenter many years ago cut a few words; they are full of\r\nmeaning in connection with our subject, and they run as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Man of weal, beware; beware before of what cometh behind.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFELLING TIMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe end to be attained in the management of timber trees is to produce\r\nfrom a given number the largest possible amount of sound and durable\r\nwoods. When a tree, under conditions favourable to its growth, ceases\r\nincreasing the diameter of its trunk, and loses its foliage earlier in\r\nthe autumn than it is wont to do, and when the top of the tree brings\r\nforth no leaves in spring, these facts may be considered as indications\r\nof decline, and that the tree is of sufficient age to be felled. The\r\nstate of the upper branches of a tree may be considered to be amongst\r\nthe best indications of its soundness, and provided they be in a\r\nhealthy condition, the withering of the lower branches is a matter of\r\ncomparatively small importance.\r\n\r\nTrees may be considered as tall, middle rank, and low, and the size\r\nto which they will attain depends on many different circumstances.\r\nSome trees, the stems of which are short on the average, as the lime,\r\nare virtually of tall growth, from the manner in which a number of\r\nvertical branches of large size ascend from the stem. And other trees,\r\nagain, whose branches are comparatively short, are of tall growth, in\r\nconsequence of the length of the stems--like the beech.\r\n\r\nThe average duration of trees differs, as is well known, in different\r\nspecies, and they exhibit different symptoms of decay. There are oaks in\r\nWindsor Great Park, certainly nearly one thousand years old, and which\r\nexhibit even now no appearance of approaching the end of their life. Mr.\r\nMenzies, the surveyor, in his work on Windsor Great Park, describes some\r\nof the indications of incipient decay which are peculiar to the several\r\nkinds of trees. “When a beech begins to fail,” he says, “fungi appear\r\neither at the roots or on the forks, the leaves curl up as if they had\r\nbeen scorched, and the tree quickly perishes. In an elm, a great limb\r\nfirst fails, while the rest of the tree continues green and vigorous,\r\nbut in a few years the whole tree suddenly dies. Coniferous trees die\r\ngradually, but quickly. The oak shows the first symptoms at the points\r\nof its highest branches, while the rest of the tree will remain healthy\r\nand sound for years.” This peculiarity of the oak did not escape the eye\r\nof Shakespere, that universal observer, who describes the monarch of the\r\nwoods as not only having its boughs mossed with age, but its\r\n\r\n    “High top bald with dry antiquity.”\r\n\r\nThe age for felling trees is a subject which calls for the deepest\r\nconsideration, but does not always receive that attention which is due\r\nto its importance. Timber growers in their haste to supply the market,\r\ntoo often fell trees that have not arrived at maturity, the heart-wood\r\nbeing therefore imperfect, with much sap-wood, and, of course, little\r\ndurability; but unfortunately they are the more readily led to do so\r\non account of the increase in size being very slow after a certain\r\nage. Builders are sensible of the inferior quality of young timber in\r\nrespect to duration, and it is their province to check this growing evil,\r\nby giving a better price for timber that has acquired a proper degree\r\nof density and hardness; but, unfortunately, this is an age for cheap\r\nbuilding, without much regard being given as to durability.\r\n\r\nFelling should not be too early, for the reasons above mentioned; neither\r\nshould it be in the decline of the tree, when its elasticity and vigour\r\nare lost, and the wood becomes brittle, tainted, and discoloured, with\r\nthe pith gone, and the heart in progress of decay. Maturity is the period\r\nwhen the sap-wood bears a small proportion, and the heart-wood has become\r\nuniform and compact. Sir John Evelyn writes, “It should be in the vigour\r\nand perfection of trees, that a felling should be celebrated.” It must\r\nbe obvious, however, that it is a worse fault to fell wood before it has\r\nacquired thorough firmness, than when it is just in the wane, and its\r\nheart may exhibit but the first symptoms of decay; for in the former\r\nthere is no perfect enduring timber to be got, while in the latter the\r\ngreater part is in the zenith of its strength.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are certain symptoms by which it may be ascertained when\r\na tree is on the decline, it is somewhat difficult to decide just when a\r\ntree is at maturity. From the investigations of naturalists, however, it\r\nmay be safe to consider that hard-wood trees, as oak and chestnut, should\r\nnever be cut before they are sixty years old, the average age for felling\r\nbeing from eighty to ninety years, and the average quantity of timber\r\nproduced by a tree of that age is about a load and a half, or about 75\r\ncubic feet.\r\n\r\nDaviller states (see ‘Cours d’Architecture’) “that an oak should not be\r\nfelled at a less age than sixty years.” Belidor considers (see ‘Sciences\r\ndes Ingénieurs’) “that one hundred years is the best age for the oak to\r\nbe felled.”\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that the times mentioned are by no means\r\narbitrary, for situation, soil, &c., have much to do with it. For the\r\nsoft woods, as the Norway spruce and Scotch pine in Norway, the proper\r\nage is between seventy and one hundred years. The ash, larch, and elm,\r\nmay be cut when the trees are between fifty and ninety years old; and\r\nbetween thirty and fifty years is a proper age for poplars.\r\n\r\nThe felling of timber was looked upon by ancient architects as a matter\r\nof much moment. According to Vitruvius, the proper time for felling is\r\nbetween October and February, and he directs that the trees should be cut\r\nto the pith, and then suffered to remain till the sap be drained out. The\r\neffusion of the sap prevents the decay of the timber, and when it is all\r\ndrained out, and the wood becomes dry, the trees are to be cut down, when\r\nthe wood will be excellent for use. A similar effect might be produced\r\nby placing the timber on its end as soon as it is felled, and it would,\r\nno doubt, compensate for the extra expense by its durability in use. In\r\nFrance, so long ago as 1669, a royal order limited the felling of naval\r\ntimber from the 1st October to 15th April, when the “wind was at north,”\r\nand “in the wane of the moon.” Buonaparte directed that the time for\r\nfelling naval timber should be “in the decrease of the moon, from 1st\r\nNovember to 15th March,” in order to render it more durable. In England,\r\nin the first year of James I., there was an Act of Parliament prohibiting\r\nevery one from cutting oak timber, except in the barking season, under a\r\nsevere penalty.\r\n\r\nJames I. was not the only English sovereign who has been concerned with\r\ntimber trees; for King John was obliged to cancel at Runnemede the cruel\r\nforest laws enacted by his father, William the Conqueror, especially\r\nthose restricting the people from fattening their hogs.\r\n\r\nUp to a recent period large droves of hogs were fattened upon the\r\nacorns of the New Forest in Hampshire. At the present time the hogs of\r\nEstremadura are principally fed upon the acorns of the _Ballota_ oak; and\r\nto this cause is assigned the great delicacy of their flesh.\r\n\r\nA Berkshire labourer, living near Windsor Forest, thus speaks of the\r\ndelicacy of acorn-fed pork: “Well, that be pretty like the thing. I\r\nhadn’t tasted the like o’ that this many a day. It is so meller--when you\r\ngets your teeth on it, you thinks you has it; but afore you knows where\r\nyou is, ain’t it wanished!”\r\n\r\nThere is another point in connection with the time of felling timber,\r\nwhich ought to be noticed. It is a widespread opinion that trees should\r\nbe felled during the wane of the moon. This planetary influence is open\r\nto doubt, but the opinion prevails wherever there are large forests.\r\nColumella, Cato, Vitruvius, and Pliny, all had their notions of cutting\r\ntimber at certain ages of the moon. The wood-cutters of South America act\r\nupon it, so do their brethren in the German forests, in Brazil, and in\r\nYucatan. It was formerly interwoven in the Forest Code of France, and,\r\nwe believe, is so still. Vitruvius recommends this custom, and we find\r\nIsaac Ware writing of the suggestion: “This has been laughed at, and\r\nsupposed to be an imaginary advantage. There may be good in following\r\nthe practice; there can be no harm: and therefore, when I am to depend\r\nupon my timber, I will observe it.” The Indian wood-cutters believe that\r\ntimber is much more liable to decay, if cut when the moon is in crescent.\r\n\r\nAn American writer, in 1863, thus writes of his experience in the matter:\r\n“Tradition says that the ‘old’ of the moon, in February, is the best\r\ntime to cut timber; but from more than twenty years of observation and\r\nactual experience, I am fully convinced it is about the worst time to cut\r\nmost, if not all kinds of hard-wood timber. Birch, ash, and most or all\r\nkinds of hard wood will invariably _powder-post_ if cut any time in the\r\nfall after the tree is frozen, or before it is thoroughly leaved out in\r\nthe spring of the year. But if cut after the sap in the tree is used up\r\nin the growth of the tree, until freezing weather again comes, it will\r\nin no instance produce the _powder-post_ worm. When the tree is frozen,\r\nand cut in this condition, the worm first commences its ravages on the\r\ninside film of the bark, and then penetrates the wood until it destroys\r\nthe sap part thereof. I have found the months of August, September, and\r\nOctober, to be the three best in the year to cut hard-wood timber. If cut\r\nin these months, the timber is harder, more elastic, and durable than if\r\ncut in winter months. I have, by weighing timber, found that of equal\r\nquality got out for joiners’ tools is much heavier when cut and got out\r\nin the above-named months than in the winter and spring months, and it\r\nis not so liable to crack. You may cut a tree in September, and another\r\nin the ‘old’ of the moon in February following, and let them remain, and\r\nin one year from the cutting of the first tree, you will find it sound\r\nand unhurt, while the one last cut is scarcely fit for firewood, from\r\ndecay. Chestnut timber for building will last longest, provided the bark\r\nbe taken off. Hemlock and pine ought to be cut before being hard frozen,\r\nalthough they do not _powder-post_; yet if they are cut in the middle\r\nof winter, or in the spring of the year, and the bark is not taken off,\r\nthe grub will immediately commence its ravages between the bark and the\r\nwood. I have walnut timber on hand which has been cut from one to ten\r\nyears, with the bark on, which was designed for ox-helves and ox-bows,\r\nand not a worm is to be found therein; it was cut between 1st August and\r\n1st November. I have other pieces of similar timber cut in the winter\r\nmonths, not two year’s old, and they are entirely destroyed, being full\r\nof _powder-post_ and grub-worms.”\r\n\r\nWhat shall we say when doctors disagree? The theory given to account for\r\nwhat is assumed to be a fact, is, that as the moon grows the sap rises,\r\nand the wood, therefore is less dense than when the moon is waning,\r\nbecause at that time the sap in the tree diminishes. No evidence whatever\r\ncan be offered in support of the theory, and one would certainly imagine\r\nthat the rise or fall of the sap would depend on the quantity of heat\r\nwhich reaches the foot of the tree, and not at all on attraction.\r\n\r\nAll investigations tend to prove that the only proper time for felling\r\ntimber is that at which the tree contains the least sap. There are two\r\nseasons in each year when the vessels are filled. One is in spring, when\r\nthe fluid is in motion to supply nutriment to the leaves, and deposit\r\nmaterial for new wood; the other is in the early part of autumn, when,\r\nafter the stagnation which gives the new wood time to dry and harden, it\r\nagain flows to make the vegetable deposits in the vessels of the wood.\r\nAt neither of these times should trees be felled; for, if the pores be\r\nfull of vegetable juices, which being acted upon by heat and moisture may\r\nferment, the wood will decay. Of the two periods, the spring must be the\r\nworst, because the wood then contains the greatest quantity of matter in\r\na state fit for germination.\r\n\r\nThe results of a series of experiments made in Germany show that\r\nDecember-cut wood allows no water to pass through it longitudinally;\r\nJanuary-cut wood passed in forty-eight hours a few drops; February-cut\r\nwood let two quarts of water through its interstitial spaces in\r\nforty-eight hours; March-cut wood permitted the same to filter through in\r\ntwo and a half hours. Hence the reasons why barrels made from wood cut in\r\nMarch or April are so leaky, as the sap is then rising, and the trees are\r\npreparing to put forth their leaves.\r\n\r\nIt thus happens that the time for felling is midsummer or midwinter. The\r\nbest time for felling, according to some, is midsummer, when the leaves\r\nare fully expanded, and the sap has ceased to flow, and the extraneous\r\nvegetable matter intended for the leaves has been dislodged from the\r\ntrunk of the tree by the common sap, leaving it in a quiescent state,\r\nand free from that germinative principle which is readily excited by\r\nheat and moisture, and if the timber were cut while it remained, would\r\nsubject it to rapid decay and to operations of worms. Midwinter, amongst\r\nsome, is chosen as a time for felling, as it is stated that winter-felled\r\nheart-wood is less affected by moisture, and likely to be the best and\r\nmost durable; but as the only peculiar recommendation which that time\r\npossesses is the facility which it affords for gradual seasoning, by\r\nwhich timber is rendered less liable to split and get distorted, and\r\nslow drying being generally available at any season under shade and\r\nshelter, midsummer appears for many obvious reasons the most expedient.\r\nIn general, all the soft woods, such as elm, lime, poplar, willow,\r\nshould be felled during winter. In some kinds of trees a little after\r\nmidsummer appears to be decidedly the best time for felling. Alder felled\r\nat that time is found to be much more durable; and Ellis observes, that\r\nbeech when cut in the middle of summer is bitter, and less liable to be\r\nworm-eaten, particularly if a gash be cut to let out the sap some time\r\nbefore felling. Mr. Knowles states that, “About Naples, and in other\r\nparts of Italy, oaks have been felled in summer, and are said to have\r\nbeen very durable.” Most of the trees in southern Italy are felled in\r\nJuly and August, and the pines in the German forests are cut down mostly\r\nin summer time, and it is stated that their wood is sound.\r\n\r\nThe following are advocates for winter felling, viz. Cato, Pliny,\r\nVitruvius, Alberti, Hesiod, De Saussure, Evelyn, Darwin, and Buonaparte.\r\nSome of them consider that winter-felled timber, which has been barked\r\nand notched in the previous spring, loses much of that half-prepared\r\nwoody matter, containing seeds of fungi, &c., that there is no doubt of\r\nits superiority to summer-felled timber.\r\n\r\nThe age at which trees should be felled, and the most suitable time for\r\nthe work having been determined, there are two other things which claim\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe _first_ of these is the removal of the bark from the trunk and\r\nprincipal branches of the tree. For, in oak trees, the bark is too\r\nvaluable to be lost; and as the best period for the timber is the worst\r\nfor the bark, an ingenious method has been long partially practised,\r\nwhich not only secures the bark at the best season, but also materially\r\nimproves the timber. This method consists in taking the bark off the\r\nstanding tree early in the spring, and not felling it till after the\r\nnew foliage has put forth and died. This practice has been considered\r\nof inestimable value; for by it the sap-wood is rendered as strong and\r\ndurable as the heart-wood; and in some particular instances experiments\r\nhave shown it to be four times as strong as other wood in all respects\r\nsimilar, and grown on the same soil, but felled with the bark on and\r\ndried in sheds. Buffon, Du Hamel, and, in fact, most naturalists, have\r\nearnestly recommended the practice. Evelyn states, “To make excellent\r\nboards, bark your trees in a fit season, and let them stand naked a full\r\nyear before felling.”\r\n\r\nIn regard to the time that should elapse between the removal of the bark\r\nand the felling of a tree, a variety of opinions exist. It was the usual\r\ncustom of early architects to remove the bark in the spring, and fell the\r\ntrees during the succeeding winter. Later investigations seemed to have\r\nproved that it is better to perform the work three or even four years in\r\nadvance, instead of one, although Tredgold appears to think one year too\r\nlong. Trees will, in most situations, continue to expand and leaf out for\r\nseveral seasons after the bark has been removed. The sap remaining in the\r\nwood gradually becomes hardened into woody substance, thereby closing\r\nthe sap vessels and making it more solid. As bark separates freely from\r\nthe wood in spring, while the sap is in motion, it should be taken off\r\nat that period. When the above method is not adopted, it is well either\r\nto pierce the trunk some time before felling to drain out the sap, or\r\nimmediately on its being felled to set it on end.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ suggestion is, to cut into and around the entire trunk of\r\nthe tree, near the roots, so that the sap may be discharged; for in this\r\nmanner it will be done more easily than it can be by evaporation after\r\nthe tree is felled. In addition to this, if it be permitted to run out\r\nat the incision, a large portion of the new and fermentable matter will\r\npass out with it, which would remain in the wood if only such material\r\nis removed as would pass off by evaporation. This cutting should be made\r\nin the winter previous to the August in which the tree is to be felled;\r\nand the incision should be made as deep into the heart-wood as possible\r\nwithout inducing a premature fall of the tree.\r\n\r\nThe custom of ringing or girdling the tree before felling has been\r\nadvocated, on the ground that the seasoning is thereby expedited,\r\nand also more thoroughly effected. This is doubtful, at least, in\r\noil-containing trees (as teak, &c.), but the practice appears to be\r\ncontra-indicated for other reasons: when a tree has been ringed, many\r\nwood-cutters object to cut it down on account of its increased hardness.\r\nThis objection might be waived, were it not for another and more serious\r\none which has been adduced. It is believed to be a fact by some that\r\ntrees felled after girdling have the heart shake increased. It is\r\ndifficult to explain this, if it be actually the case.\r\n\r\nMany suggestions might be made as regards the mechanical operation of\r\nfelling trees, with which ancient nations were not unfamiliar:\r\n\r\n    … “for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill\r\n    to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.”--1 Kings v. 6.\r\n\r\nBut as these operations are familiar to all intelligent workmen, it\r\nis only necessary to mention one, viz. the value of removing from the\r\nside of the tree such branches as will strike the ground when it falls,\r\nand, by wrenching, cleave the grain of the wood, and thereby injure the\r\ntimber. Such defects, which are often found after the timber has been\r\nseasoned, could not be discovered when it left the mill.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we can truly state that the most extensive felling of\r\ntrees for _one building_ only which we have ever heard or read of is the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    “And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,\r\n    and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains.”--1 Kings v. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nON SEASONING TIMBER BY NATURAL METHODS, VIZ. HOT AND COLD AIR; FRESH AND\r\nSALT WATER; VAPOUR; SMOKE; STEAM; BOILING; CHARRING AND SCORCHING, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll timber must, whether it be sap-wood or heart-wood, be placed in\r\nsituations which will allow the sap to exude or evaporate, and this\r\nprocess is the one technically known by the term “seasoning.” There are\r\nnatural and artificial modes of seasoning, both of which have their\r\nrecommendations; but the former has certainly the right of preference,\r\nas it gives greater toughness, elasticity, and durability, and therefore\r\nshould always be employed in preparing timber for carpentry. As the word\r\n“timber” has been frequently used, it may be as well to state that it is\r\nderived, according to Dr. Johnson, from the Saxon, _timbrian_, to build:\r\nhence the above definition. The legal definition of timber is restricted\r\nto particular species of wood, and custom varies in different countries\r\nas to the species ranked among the timber trees.\r\n\r\nWhen a tree is felled, it encloses in its fibres as well as in capillary\r\nchannels a considerable quantity of sap, which is nothing else but water\r\ncharged with gummy, saccharine, saline, mucilaginous, and albuminous\r\nmatters. In this state, the latter are very liable to ferment, but they\r\nlose their liability when, by the evaporation of the sap, they pass\r\nto a dry and solid state; so that the first suggestion which naturally\r\npresents itself to the mind, is to subject the timber to a lengthened\r\nseasoning.\r\n\r\nBut the present demands for time will not admit of this, and therefore it\r\nis imperative to resort to artificial and speedy methods.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the value of timber in the log, owing to its becoming\r\nrent by the weather, it sells for 15 per cent. less the second year than\r\nthe first, and so on for less and less the longer you keep it.\r\n\r\nA natural seasoning may be adopted for specimens of moderate thickness,\r\nsuch as deals, planks, &c. At the end of eighteen months from the time of\r\nimportation they are scarcely dry enough for the consumer’s use.\r\n\r\nWhen there is time for drying it gradually, all that is necessary to be\r\ndone on removing it from the damp ground of the forest, is to place it\r\nin a dry yard, sheltered from the sun and wind, and where there is no\r\nvegetation; and set it on bearers of iron or brick in such a manner as to\r\nadmit of a ventilation all round and under it. In this manner it should\r\ncontinue two years, if intended for carpentry; and double that time,\r\nif intended for joinery; the loss of weight which should take place to\r\nrender it fit for the purposes of the former being about one-fifth; and\r\nfor the latter about one-third. In piling it, the sleepers on which the\r\nfirst pieces are laid should be perfectly level, and “out of the wind,”\r\nand so firm and solid throughout that they will remain in their original\r\nposition; for timber, if bent or made to wind before it is seasoned,\r\nwill generally retain the same form when dried. Blocks of wood should\r\nbe put between the “sticks” of timber, and each piece directly over the\r\nother, so that air may freely pass through the whole pile; for while it\r\nis necessary to shield timber from strong draughts of wind and the direct\r\naction of the hot sun, a free circulation of air and moderate warmth are\r\nequally essential.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANS OF DIFFERENT BALTIC MODES OF CUTTING DEALS FOR THE\r\nENGLISH AND FRENCH MARKETS.\r\n\r\nTHE SMALLEST TREES ARE CUT FOR DEALS; THE LARGEST FOR LOGS.\r\n\r\nOLD MODE OF CUTTING.\r\n\r\n    ENGLISH BATTEN. 7IN × 2½IN\r\n    ENGLISH DEAL. 9IN × 2½IN\r\n    ENGLISH DEAL. 9IN × 2½IN\r\n    ENGLISH BATTEN 7IN × 2½IN\r\n    9 × 2½ = 22½ × 2 = 45in\r\n    7 × 2½ = 17½ × 2 = 35/80\r\n\r\nMODE PRACTISED UNTIL THE FRENCH MARKET IMPROVED.\r\n\r\n    ENGLISH BATTEN. 7IN × 2½IN\r\n    ENGLISH DEAL. 9IN × 3IN\r\n    ENGLISH BATTEN. 7IN × 2½IN\r\n    9 × 3 = 27 = 27in\r\n    7 × 2½ = 17½ × 2 = 35/62\r\n\r\nMODE GENERALLY ADOPTED AT THE PRESENT TIME.\r\n\r\n    FRENCH DEAL. 9IN × 1¼IN\r\n    ENGLISH DEAL. 9IN × 3IN\r\n    ENGLISH DEAL. 9IN × 3IN\r\n    FRENCH DEAL. 9IN × 1¼IN\r\n    9 × 3 = 27 × 2 = 54in\r\n    9 × 1¼ = 11¼ × 2 = 22½/76½\r\n\r\n_Notes on Deals._\r\n\r\n_All deals are liable to dry rot, if placed in contact with damp\r\nbrickwork._\r\n\r\n_If the pith of a tree be left in the centre of a deal, dry rot attacks\r\nit._\r\n\r\n_Dry rot first attacks the sapwood of a deal; and next, the pith._\r\n\r\n_Stockholm, or Gefle deals are not liable to be affected with dry rot._\r\n\r\n“STRONG” DEALS _rend.

If it is to be squared into logs, it should be\r\ndone soon after some slow drying, and whole squared, if large enough, as\r\nthat removes much of the sap-wood, facilitates the drying, and prevents\r\nsplitting, which is apt to take place when it is in the round form, in\r\nconsequence of the sap-wood drying before the heart, from being less\r\ndense. If it may be quartered, it is well to treat it so after some time,\r\nas the seasoning is by that means rendered more equal. It is well also to\r\nturn it now and then, as the evaporation is greatest from the upper side.\r\nIn France, the term “bois du brin,” means timber the whole size of the\r\ntree, excepting that which is taken off to render it square.\r\n\r\nTo prevent timber warping to any serious extent, it should be well\r\nseasoned before it is cut into scantlings; and the scantlings should be\r\ncut some time before they are to be used, in order that the seasoning\r\nmay be as perfect as possible; and if they can be set upright, so much\r\nthe better, as then they will dry more rapidly. The white lowland deals\r\nof Norway and the white spruce deals of Canada have the same disposition\r\nto warp and split on drying. Du Hamel has shown that it is a great\r\nadvantage to set the timber upright, with the lower end raised a little\r\nfrom the ground; but as this cannot always be done, the timber-yards\r\nshould be well drained and kept as dry as possible. “Ancient architects,”\r\nobserves Alberti, “not only prevented the access of the scorching rays of\r\nthe sun and the rude blasts of wind, but also covered the surface with\r\ncow-dung, to prevent the too sudden evaporation from the surface.” The\r\nwarping of timber is attributable by some to the manner of its growth.\r\nBoards cut out of a tree that is twisted in its growth will not keep\r\nfrom warping; boards cut from trees that are grown in open situations\r\nhave another fault, in the heart of the tree not running straight like\r\nforest-grown wood. In a plank cut from a tree of this kind in a straight\r\nline, the heart will traverse it from one end to another. No treatment\r\nwill prevent it from warping or drying hollow on the side farthest from\r\nthe heart. Where the heart is in the centre of a plank, and each side has\r\nan equal chance of drying, it will not warp; but there will be a shake or\r\ncrack upon each side, denoting the position of the heart.\r\n\r\nSome deals, and particularly the stringy deals, are very hygrometric,\r\nand never lose the property, however long they have been seasoned, of\r\nexpanding and contracting with change of weather. White Petersburgh deals\r\nare said to have that property, however long they may have been kept,\r\nso that if used in the panel of a door, the wood alternately enters and\r\nrecedes from the groove into which it fits, as the paint will show when\r\nthat kind of deal has been used for a panel.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the north side will not warp so much as the wood from the\r\nsouth side. The face of the planks should be cut in the direction which\r\nlay from east to west as the tree stood. If this be done, the planks will\r\nwarp much less than if cut in the opposite direction. The nature of the\r\ntree, the soil upon which it is grown, the position of its growth, the\r\nperiod of the year in which it is felled, and the length of time between\r\nits felling and converting, are the principal points to be considered; a\r\nthorough knowledge and study of which is the only true principle on which\r\nwe can hope to deal with the warping and converting of timber.\r\n\r\nWood, when it is cut into small pieces, very soon acquires its utmost\r\ndegree of dryness. Dr. Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, in the month of\r\nMarch, cut a piece from the middle of a large ash tree that had been\r\nfelled about six weeks, and weighed it; its weight was 317 grains. In\r\nseven days it lost 62 grains, or nearly one-fifth of its weight. It was\r\nweighed again in August of the same year, but had not lost any more of\r\nits weight; hence it had become perfectly dry in the short space of seven\r\ndays. He also found that the sap-wood of oak lost more weight in drying\r\nthan the heart-wood, in the proportion of 10 to 7.\r\n\r\nThe time that is required to season or dry a piece of timber obviously\r\ndepends upon its magnitude; as a _general rule_, large timbers will not\r\ncontinue good so long as small ones, as sufficient time is rarely given\r\nfor a thorough seasoning. The time required to dry a piece of timber, all\r\nother things being alike, will depend on the quantity of surface exposed\r\nto the action of the air; therefore, while the quantity of timber\r\nremains the same, the larger the surface, the sooner it will dry. Also,\r\nif the quantity of surface remains the same, the time of drying will be\r\nproportioned to the quantity of matter; as the greater the quantity of\r\nmatter under the same surface, the longer it will be in drying.\r\n\r\nAs drying proceeds most rapidly in small pieces, it is therefore\r\nimportant to reduce the timber to its proper scantlings or size for\r\nuse; for however dry a piece of timber may be, when it is cut to a\r\nsmaller scantling it will shrink and lose weight, being always less dry\r\nin the centre than at the surface; and the more rapidly the drying has\r\nbeen carried on, the greater will be the difference. Nevertheless, in\r\nthe first stage of seasoning it is best that it should proceed slowly;\r\notherwise, the external pores shrink so close as not to permit the\r\nfull evaporation of the internal moisture, and the piece would split\r\nfrom unequal shrinking; and lastly, it should be reduced to the proper\r\nscantling, as already observed, some time before it is to be framed.\r\nVarious tables have been given by writers on timber, the result of\r\nalgebraical calculations, of the times of seasoning and drying for\r\ndifferent woods of different lengths, breadths, and thicknesses, in the\r\nopen air; but as wood even of the same description and quality varies\r\nso much, this matter is best left to those who are well acquainted with\r\ntimber. It may, however, be stated that the time required for drying\r\nunder cover is shorter than in the open air, in the proportion of 5 to 7.\r\n\r\nThe English shipwright considers that three years are required to\r\nthoroughly season timber. The timbers for ships are usually cut out\r\nto their shape and dimensions for about a year before they are framed\r\ntogether, and they are commonly left a year longer in the skeleton shape\r\nto complete the seasoning, as in that condition they are more favourably\r\nsituate as regards exposure to the air than when they are closely covered\r\nin with planking.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of mention that all the harder woods require increased care\r\nin the seasoning, which is often badly begun by exposure to the sun or\r\nhot winds in their native climates: their greater impenetrability to\r\nthe air the more disposes them to crack, and their comparative scarcity\r\nand expense are also powerful arguments on the score of precaution. Oak\r\ntimber requires to be very carefully seasoned, as it is generally used\r\nin buildings for the best description of work, and should unseasoned oak\r\nbe used for “panelling,” any shrinkage will be fatal to the work. Mr.\r\nGeorge Marshall, timber merchant (see the _Builder_, January 20, 1872),\r\nwith respect to seasoning oak timber, observes: “I should select oak\r\ntrees known to be old and hearty, with clean, straight butts, from 15\r\ninches to 20 inches in diameter. I should then have the bark taken off\r\nas they stand, and leave them thus till the winter; the sap will then\r\npartially dry out, and make the wood a rich brown colour. As soon as they\r\nare cut down, have them sawn up at once into the lengths you require the\r\npanelling, 6 inches or 8 inches wide and 1 inch to 1½ inch thick. Be\r\ncareful to cut all the heart shakes, by having one cut through the centre\r\nof the log before edging the boards to the required width. With regard\r\nto the drying process, stack the boards in a shed with a good draught\r\nthrough it, and load them down, with slips between each board, to prevent\r\nwarping. If this be done they will be found to dry well and speedily, and\r\nthey will not require to be exposed to the weather.”\r\n\r\nSir. Robert Phillips, on seasoning oak for panelling, states: “If the\r\ntree is large enough for the purpose, cut it into four, in sections, by\r\ndrawing a vertical and horizontal line across the end, meeting in the\r\ncentre. If too small for this, cut it into 4½ inch or 6-inch plank, as\r\nsoon as possible after felling, and then stack _on end_ out in the open:\r\ndo not lay on the ground, but stand it as nearly _vertical_ on its end as\r\npossible, and keep it wet during the first three months. If the weather\r\nis dry, well _wet_ it with water poured on the top, and allowed to run\r\ndown. Let the ends stand on a piece of quartering, to keep it out of the\r\ndirt, or it will be stained some distance up. After standing thus for\r\nsome six months, after putting it in a dry place for some time, cut it\r\ninto the scantlings you require, always bearing in mind that oak will,\r\nafter this seasoning, shrink at least half an inch to a foot, in width\r\nand thickness. They should then be stacked and stripped, and covered with\r\nspare boards, and weighted on the top, for at least six months--as much\r\nmore as possible--in a covered shed, with plenty of air, occasionally\r\nturned over and shifted, till they are dry enough to make dust when\r\nplaned, and not turn the shaving black. They will then be fit for use.\r\n\r\n“I should advise for the panels to be cut _feather-edged_ boards, in\r\nradial lines from the centre of the tree: it will be a waste of material,\r\nbut will repay in the beauty of the wood, and the way it will stand\r\nwithout warping. Most of the panels of our old cathedrals were rent (_not\r\nsawn_) in this way, and stand admirably. The butt of the tree should be\r\ntaken, the top being used for a rougher purpose.”\r\n\r\nMr. George Marshall and Mr. Robert Phillips might have mentioned that\r\nthe oak trees should be of the _Quercus Robur_ species, and _not_ the\r\n_Quercus Sessiliflora_. They are easily distinguished when growing by the\r\nfollowing peculiarities: The acorn-stalks of the _Robur_ are _long_; the\r\nacorns grow singly, or seldom two on the same footstalk; the leaves are\r\n_short_. The acorn-stalks of the _Sessiliflora_ are _short_; the acorns\r\ngrow in clusters of two or three, close to the stem of the branch; the\r\nleaves are _long_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER SEASONING.\r\n\r\nWhen there is not time for gradual drying, the best method, perhaps,\r\nthat can be adopted, especially for sappy timber, and if strength is not\r\nprincipally required, is immediately on felling to immerse it in running\r\nwater; and after allowing it to remain there about a fortnight, to set\r\nit in the wind to dry. Some persons prefer this method of seasoning\r\ntimber, as they say it prevents cleaving, and strips and seasons better\r\nafterwards. This process has been adopted with good results by placing\r\nthe boards end on at the head of a mill race for fourteen or twenty days,\r\nat most, and then setting the boards upright, and subject to the action\r\nof the sun and wind; though it is questionable whether the sun will not\r\ndo them more harm than good. As they stand, turn them daily, and when\r\nperfectly dry--which process will take about one month--it is considered\r\nthey will be found to floor better than timber after many years of dry\r\nseasoning. The sap-wood of oak is said to be improved by this method,\r\nbeing much less subject to be worm-eaten; and providing it is placed in\r\nfresh running water, Mr. G. A. Rogers, the celebrated wood carver, is of\r\nopinion that the colour of the oak is improved. The more tender woods,\r\nsuch as alder and the like, are less subject to the worm when water\r\nseasoned. Beech is said to be much benefited by immersion. It should be\r\nremembered that the timber should be altogether under water (chained\r\ndown beneath its surface), as partial immersion is very destructive. Du\r\nHamel considers “that where strength is required, wood ought not to be\r\nput in water.” Timber should never be kept floating in ponds or docks,\r\nas in London; but it should be stacked, as at Liverpool and Gloucester.\r\nTimber that has been lying for months in ponds or docks is sometimes cut\r\nup, and in six or seven days fixed in a building; consequently, the usual\r\nresult takes place, viz. dry rot. After having been swelled by soaking\r\nmuch beyond its former bulk, the baulk of timber is put on the saw-pit,\r\nand cut into scantlings, and framed while in this wet state, therefore\r\nit cannot be surprising that the dry rot soon appears as a natural\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nAmongst wheelwrights the water seasoning is in general favour. It is\r\nsaid that the colour of the white woods is improved by water seasoning,\r\nboiling, or steaming. The Venetians place the oak used for gun-carriages\r\nin water for two years before it is used, and the timber for sea service\r\ntwo or three years under water. The Turks do not appear to pay any\r\nattention to seasoning, for they fell their timber at all times of the\r\nyear without any regard to the season, and although they grow very good\r\noak, it is used so green and unseasoned that it not only twists, but\r\ndecays rapidly, as anyone may observe in the houses at Constantinople and\r\nother Turkish towns.\r\n\r\nTimber is rendered more durable by placing it in a stream of water,\r\nsaturated with lime, for eight or ten days, and it also makes it less\r\nliable to the attack of worms; but it, however, becomes hard after being\r\ndried, and is difficult to be worked; and therefore the process should\r\nbe applied to timber which has been sawn into scantlings, and is ready\r\nfor use. Mr. William Chapman, in 1812, considered that an immersion of\r\ntimber in hot limewash in deep ponds, exposing little surface to the air,\r\nmerited a trial; but in 1816, from experiments he had made, he was of\r\nopinion that it had proved injurious to timber.\r\n\r\nEvelyn states that green elm, if plunged for a few days in water\r\n(especially salt water), obtains an admirable seasoning. According to\r\nSociety of Arts _Trans._, 1819, every trace of fungus was eradicated from\r\nthe ship “Eden,” by its remaining eighteen months under sea water. Salt\r\nwater is considered good for ship timber, but for timber to be employed\r\nin the construction of dwelling-houses, fresh water is better. Pliny\r\nnotices, as a fact, that certain woods on being dried after immersion in\r\nthe sea acquire additional density and durability. M. de Lapparent, late\r\nDirector of the French Navy, considers that timber cannot be seasoned\r\nin salt water, but in fresh, or at the most, in brackish water. The\r\ncondition of the timber which, at the port of Rochefort, is kept in\r\nditches filled with fresh water is in this respect most favourable; that\r\nkept at Toulon, Brest, and Lorient, where the water is brackish, is much\r\nless so; but to estimate their relative advantages, it would be necessary\r\nto test the average density of these waters. It is, however, at Cherbourg\r\nthat this natural preparation of timber is the most inefficient, as the\r\nbeds-of sand in which the timber is buried, near the Pool of Tourlaville,\r\ncontain but a small quantity of water, which, being nearly always\r\nstagnant, very quickly exhausts itself, and is very prejudicial.\r\n\r\nAt the Cologne International Agricultural Exhibition, in 1865, three\r\nsleepers were exhibited from the Magdeburg Leipsiger Railway, from the\r\nSalt Work Branch, at Stassfurt, laid in 1857. These were moistened by the\r\nrefuse of the salt which was lost from the load and by the rain. The jury\r\nin their Report stated that these sleepers proved nothing, “because every\r\nold table on which fish or meat has been salted, proves that a constant\r\nmoistening with salt water preserves the wood from decay, but as soon\r\nas the process of salting is given up, the salted matter is immediately\r\ngiven out, and the timber soon decays. In this case it would have been\r\nimportant to have known that these sleepers, after having been salted,\r\nhad lain anywhere else than in the Salt Work Branch without getting fresh\r\nsalt applied, and then to have seen if they would have been as perfect as\r\nthey are now. They, indeed, prove nothing but the fact that if sleepers\r\nbe daily sprinkled with salt they will remain sound, but the price paid\r\nfor this durability might be very considerable.” As the use of salt as\r\na preservative agent will be considered in the next chapter, it will be\r\nbest to defer the consideration of salt-water seasoning until then.\r\n\r\nIn India, teak, sál, and blackwood, &c., improve by lying in water, or\r\nin the soft black mud of an estuary: there is one exception, viz. heddé,\r\nwhich deteriorates from steeping, and should be carted to its destination.\r\n\r\nEvelyn states that he had found a fortnight’s immersion in river water\r\nsufficient, and this opinion is held by Silloway, a North American\r\nauthority; but Dr. Porcher, a South American writer, recommends a six\r\nmonths’ immersion in water, and a six months’ exposure to wind and shade.\r\nVitruvius and Alberti consider that timber should be left immersed in a\r\nrunning stream thirty days.\r\n\r\nIt is considered that the longer wood has remained under water, the more\r\nrapidly it dries; for instance, every one is aware that the firewood\r\nbrought out of the river is less green and burns better than that brought\r\nby waggon or boat.\r\n\r\nIn 1817, Admiral Count Chateauvieux, a Sardinian naval officer, observed\r\nto Mr. McWilliam that it was a custom at the Royal Arsenal, at Genoa,\r\nas a preventive against the diseases of timber, to steep it about three\r\nyears in fresh water immediately after it is felled. Mr. James Dickson,\r\nof Gottenburg, timber merchant (member of the firm Peter Dickson and\r\nCompany, London), many years engaged in the Swedish timber trade,\r\nobserved in 1835, “If square timber lies in the water two or three years,\r\nit rends at the heart, but I should not say it would, perhaps, for the\r\nfirst year; but the exterior part rends soon by exposure to the weather.”\r\nIn 1818, the Chevalier de Campugano, Secretary of Legation to the Spanish\r\nEmbassy, stated that in Spain, when timber is felled, it is generally\r\nlaid in water for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nThe sap in timber, by reason of the matters which it holds in solution,\r\nis denser than pure water; moreover, it is enclosed in fibres or channels\r\npermeable at the ends.\r\n\r\nSupposing in submerged timber, the surrounding water to be flowing, or at\r\nleast changing, this water will conclude by occupying, if not altogether,\r\nat least in a great degree, the place of the sap, which will have issued\r\nforth, carrying with it the fermenting principle with which it is\r\ncharged. The timber, therefore, which has remained _sufficiently long_\r\nin the water ought to be much less susceptible of fermentation than that\r\nseasoned only by the atmosphere. Besides, as pure water evaporates much\r\neasier than that which contains certain principles, this timber ought to\r\nbe seasoned much sooner than the other.\r\n\r\nOf steeping generally, whether in cold or warm water, it must be\r\nparticularly observed that it dissolves the substance of the wood, and\r\nnecessarily renders it lighter; indeed, it is known that notwithstanding\r\nwood that is carefully submerged remains good for a very long period\r\nafter the water has dissolved a certain soluble part, it is, when taken\r\nout and dried, liable to be brittle, and unfit for any other work but\r\njoinery.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEASONING BY STEAMING AND BOILING, ETC.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of joinery, steaming and boiling are very good methods,\r\nas the loss of elasticity and strength which they produce, and which\r\nare essential in carpentry, is compensated by the tendency to shrinkage\r\nbeing reduced; the durability also is said by some to be rather improved\r\nthan otherwise, at least from steaming. If steaming be not carried on\r\ntoo quickly it will answer, but if it be pushed with too much vigour\r\nit is very apt to produce a permanent warping and distortion of the\r\nmaterial. Oak of British growth may be seasoned by this process, as\r\nwithout this precaution it requires a long time to season. It has been\r\nascertained, that of woods seasoned by these methods, those dried soonest\r\nthat had been steamed; but the drying in either case should be somewhat\r\ngradual, and four hours are generally sufficient for the boiling or\r\nsteaming process. The question of time will depend upon circumstances:\r\nsome persons consider that one hour should be allowed for every inch\r\nin thickness. In some dockyards, salt water is used in the boilers, in\r\nothers fresh, from considerations of convenience; and the fact is, plank\r\nboiled in salt water never gets rid of the salts that naturally enter the\r\npores of the wood in boiling; and such being the case, the ship in which\r\nthis plank is used is much more liable to the effects of damp than she\r\nwould have been if the plank had been boiled in fresh water.\r\n\r\nBoiling and steaming are likewise employed for softening woods, to\r\nfacilitate the cutting as well as bending of them. Thus, in Taylor’s\r\npatent machines for making casks, the blocks intended for the staves are\r\ncut out of white Canada oak to the size of 30 inches by 5 inches and\r\nsmaller. They are well steamed, and then sliced into pieces ½ inch or\r\n⅝ inch thick, at the rate of 200 in each minute, by a process far more\r\nrapid and economical than sawing; the instrument being a revolving iron\r\nplate of 12 feet diameter, with two radial knives arranged somewhat like\r\nthe irons of an ordinary plane or spokeshave.\r\n\r\nHow far steaming or boiling affects the durability of timber has not been\r\nsatisfactorily ascertained; but it is said that the planks of a ship\r\nnear the bows, which are bent by steaming, have never been observed to\r\nbe affected with dry rot. With respect to boiling, Du Hamel’s opinion is\r\nnot favourable as to its adding to the durability of timber; for when a\r\npiece of dry wood was immersed in boiling water, and afterwards dried in\r\na stove, it not only lost the water it had imbibed, but also a part of\r\nits substance; and when the experiment was repeated with the same piece\r\nof wood, it lost more of its substance the second time than it did the\r\nfirst. Tredgold--no mean authority--considers that “boiled or steamed\r\ntimber shrinks less, and stands better than that which is naturally\r\nseasoned.” Barlow is of opinion that “the seasoning goes on more rapidly\r\nafter the piece is steamed than when boiled.”\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Crimean and Baltic campaigns the port of Cherbourg\r\nwas almost completely cleared of staves sufficiently seasoned for making\r\ncasks. The engineer at the head of the coopering department determined to\r\nboil in fresh water the newly-cut staves, and compare the time of their\r\nseasoning with that of other staves cut from the same forests, but not\r\nprepared; and the result was that after four or five months’ exposure\r\nto the atmosphere, the boiled staves were perfectly fit for working up,\r\nwhile to bring the others to the same point fifteen months were barely\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nSteaming is understood to prevent dry rot. No doubt boiling and steaming\r\npartly remove the ferment spores, but _may not_ destroy the vitality\r\nof those remaining. For, according to Milne-Edwards, on ‘Spontaneous\r\nGeneration.’ he has seen tardigrades resist the prolonged action of a\r\ntemperature of 248° Fahr., and has known them to survive a temperature of\r\n284° Fahr. That low forms of vegetation are fully as tenacious of life\r\ncannot be doubted.\r\n\r\nBoiling and steaming also coagulate the albumen at 140° Fahr. Although\r\ncoagulated albumen is insoluble in water, the water solution is by this\r\nheating process sealed up in the wood, and the cohesion of the latter is\r\nsaid to be diminished.\r\n\r\nThe first essays in the art of drying wood artificially carry us back to\r\na period now tolerably remote. Wollaston and Fourcroy both recommended\r\nthe drying of wood in ovens. Newmann, a German chemist, suggested another\r\nmethod, which has since been adopted in a somewhat different form, i.\r\ne. _steaming_ the wood. Newmann placed the wood to be dried in a large\r\nwooden chest, taking care to leave spaces between the pieces, and then\r\nturned on the steam from a boiler provided for the purpose. The condensed\r\nsteam, charged with albuminous matter taken up from the wood, or rather\r\nfrom its surface, was run off from time to time, and the process of the\r\noperation was judged by the colour of the water. When the latter was\r\nclear and colourless the chest was opened, and the wood withdrawn for use\r\nwithout further preparation. The process would have been useful enough\r\nif _superheated_ steam, which would have dried the wood by absorbing\r\nthe moisture, could have been used, but the cost of the process would\r\ndoubtless have been too high to permit of its practical application.\r\n\r\nIn 1837, M. de Mecquenem devised a method of desiccation, in which the\r\npieces of wood to be dried were placed in a closed chamber, and subjected\r\nto a current of hot air, heated for the purpose by a special apparatus,\r\nand driven by a blower. The air entered by apertures in the lower part\r\nof the chambers, and escaped at the top laden with the moisture absorbed\r\nfrom the wood.\r\n\r\nIn 1839, M. Charpentier obtained a _brévet d’invention_ for a process of\r\ndrying wood in hermetically-closed chambers. The wood was subjected to\r\nthe action of air heated by contact with metal plates covering the flue\r\nof a coke furnace. This air entered by conduits on the level of the floor\r\nof the chamber, and escaped at the top through apertures leading into the\r\nchimney of the furnace.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, M. Saint Preuve invented a process for forcing steam\r\ninto pores of the wood, and, by condensation of this steam in the pores,\r\nsucking in a preservative preparation.\r\n\r\nIn 1847, MM. Brochard and Watteau’s process was introduced. It consists\r\nsimply of filling the cylinder with steam, and making a vacuum by forcing\r\nin a cold solution of salt, &c.\r\n\r\nThe plan which has been for some years in use in England is the\r\ninjection, by means of a ventilator, of hot air into the drying stove\r\nwhere the wood is placed: by this the temperature is gently and gradually\r\nraised until it reaches boiling heat. But, as wood is one of the worst\r\nconductors known of caloric, if this plan is applied to large logs, the\r\ninterior fibres still retain their original bulk, while those near the\r\nsurface have a tendency to shrink; the consequence of which would be\r\ncracks and splits of more or less depth.\r\n\r\nTimber may be dried by passing rapid currents of heated air through it\r\nunder pressure. This plan was carried out with the timber used for the\r\nfloorings of the Coal Exchange, London. The wood was taken in its natural\r\nstate, and in less than ten days it was thoroughly seasoned. In some\r\ncases, from 10 to 48 per cent. of moisture was taken out of the wood,\r\nand although the floorings have now been down a great many years, it is\r\nstated that very little shrinkage has been found, except in the case of\r\na few pieces which were put down in the latter portion of the work, and\r\nwhich had not been submitted to the seasoning process.\r\n\r\nThe process of desiccation, patented by Messrs. Davison and Symington,\r\nin 1844, is of great practical value in reducing the time requisite\r\nfor seasoning timber. It is peculiarly applicable to the seasoning of\r\nflooring boards and of the wood used in joiners’ work. Care must be\r\nexercised when removing the timber from the stove to the building in\r\nwhich it is to be used, that it be not exposed to the wet, nor even to a\r\ndamp atmosphere for any lengthened period. The advantage of this process\r\nover the ordinary stoving consists in the temperature never being so\r\nhigh as to scorch the wood, by which the strength of the fibres would\r\nbe injured; and in the facility for removing the vapour as fast as it\r\nis expelled from the wood, in consequence of the air being propelled\r\nthrough the stove at any required velocity and temperature. As compared\r\nwith furnace and steam-stoving ordinarily employed to desiccate woods,\r\nthe great superiority of this process is established by its seasoning\r\nthe wood quite as rapidly, but much more thoroughly; and instead of wood\r\nbeing rendered brittle, as it is to some extent by stoving, this mode\r\ndoes not reduce the strength and tenacity of the wood. The principle\r\nof the invention is propelled currents of heated air; but the heat\r\nhas to be regulated according to the texture of the various woods.\r\nHonduras mahogany might be exposed to a heat of 300°, and the whole of\r\nthe moisture can be taken out in three days. Timber 9 inches square is\r\nconsidered by Mr. Davison a proper size for his invention. This process\r\nis described as “A method or methods of drying, seasoning, and hardening\r\nwood, and other articles, parts of which are also applicable to the\r\ndesiccation of vegetable substances generally.” The first or principal\r\npart of the invention consists in drying, seasoning, and hardening wood\r\nand other articles--among which other articles are included generally all\r\nthings made of wood, or chiefly of wood--by means, as has been stated,\r\nof rapid currents of heated air. The manner in which these currents of\r\nheated air are produced, is by an apparatus consisting of a furnace\r\nand a series of pipes withinside of a core of brickwork. On each side\r\nof the furnace, on a level with the fire-bars, is a horizontal tube;\r\ncommunicating and springing from these tubes are a series of eighteen\r\ntubes placed vertically and parallel to each other over the furnace. The\r\nouter end of one of the horizontal tubes communicates with a fan or other\r\nimpelling apparatus for driving a constant stream of atmospheric air\r\nthrough the tubes. As the air passes through the tubes it becomes heated\r\nat a high temperature, and rushes out at the farther end of the other\r\nhorizontal tube, and is thus conveyed to the place where it is applied.\r\nThe materials to be subjected to the heated currents, such as logs,\r\ndeals, &c., by outward application, must be placed in closed chambers,\r\ngalleries, vaults, or flues, which are to be of any suitable form or\r\nmagnitude; but it is recommended that they should be made of fire-brick,\r\nand have double doors or shutters for introducing or removing the wood.\r\nHonourable Mention was made of Messrs. Davison and Symington’s process of\r\ndesiccation, by the jury, Class IV., Exhibition of 1851, England.\r\n\r\nSome amusing instances are related of the efficiency of Davison and\r\nSymington’s process. Thus, a violin had been in the owner’s possession\r\nfor upwards of sixteen years; how old it was when he first had it is\r\nnot known. Upon being exposed to this process it lost, in eight hours,\r\nno less than five-sixths (nearly five and two-thirds) per cent. of its\r\nown weight. This there is every reason to believe was owing to the\r\nblocks glued inside, for the purpose of holding the more slender parts\r\ntogether. A violin maker of high reputation, having an order to make\r\nan instrument for one of the first violinists of the day, was requested\r\nto have the wood seasoned by this process; only three days were allowed\r\nfor the experiment, in which the wood was seasoned and sent home. The\r\ntwo heaviest pieces were reduced in weight 2½ lbs. It is ascertained\r\nthat, by this means of drying, the effect of age has been given to the\r\ninstrument made from the above wood, and it was, in 1848, _first fiddle_\r\nin the orchestra of Her Majesty’s Theatre, London. The wood had been\r\nin the possession of its owners for eight years, and it was sent from\r\nSwitzerland, in the first instance, as _dry wood_.\r\n\r\nIn proof of the value of this invention for the manufacture and cleansing\r\nof brewers’ casks, it was stated, in 1848, that since its adoption at\r\nTrueman’s brewery, Spitalfields, a saving of 300 tons of coals has been\r\neffected annually.\r\n\r\nFlues or chambers for the heated air may be constructed in parallel\r\nlines, either in the floors or upright walls of a building, having narrow\r\nopenings through which the heated air may issue in thin streams, and\r\nspread itself over the surface of the wood. If the openings are in the\r\nfloor, the wood will require to be placed in an upright position; but if\r\nadmitted in a horizontal direction, standards and skeleton shelves will\r\nbe necessary to lay it upon. The great object, in all cases, is to bring\r\nthe heated air as speedily as possible into contact with the wood, and to\r\nallow it, after it has done its office, to pass away as speedily.\r\n\r\nFurnaces and apparatus for the production of rapid currents of heated\r\nair may be erected to prepare any quantity of timber or articles of wood\r\nat one time, but care should be taken that whatever the size of the\r\noutlet may be from the series of pipes or vessels by which the heat is\r\ngenerated, an outlet of at least equal dimensions is left for the free\r\nexit of the air and the vapours thrown off. It should also be observed,\r\nin constructing the open space in the floor or upright walls for the\r\nstream of heated air to pass towards the timber, that the superficial\r\narea of the whole of them combined does not exceed the dimensions of the\r\nprincipal outlet of the pipes at the extremity of the furnace, so that a\r\nfree current of heated air may be allowed to pass uniformly throughout\r\nthe chambers containing the wood to be prepared. The temperature proper\r\nto be given to the air, and velocity to the current in each case, will\r\ndepend on the size, density, and maturity of the wood to be acted upon.\r\nThe inventors found by their experiments that wood generally may be\r\nadvantageously subjected to currents of air raised to a temperature of\r\n400° Fahr., when the currents are impelled at the rate of 100 feet per\r\nsecond. But when the wood is in a green state, it is better to commence\r\nat a lower temperature, say from 150° to 200°, and gradually raise it to\r\nthe high degree before stated, as the desiccation proceeds, an object\r\nwhich may, in some cases, be facilitated by carrying a cold-air drain\r\nfrom the fanner or other propelling apparatus, and attaching a damper to\r\nit, so that any quantity of cold air required to reduce the temperature\r\nof the hot current may, from time to time, be admitted. When, again, the\r\nwood is in the log or unconverted state, it should be bored or augured\r\nout in the centre, and the current of hot air caused to traverse it as\r\nwell interiorly as exteriorly, whereby much time will be saved in the\r\nprocess of desiccation, and a more uniform result obtained.\r\n\r\nWoods treated in this manner, and with the above modifications when\r\nrequisite, part rapidly with their natural sap and any other aqueous\r\nmatter which they may contain, and the fibres are brought closer together.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the time required to season the wood upon this plan, much\r\nmust depend upon the original state of dryness it may be in, as well\r\nas the quality and temperature of the heated air forced into contact\r\nwith it. It may suffice to remark that the wood may safely remain thus\r\nexposed till any escape of moisture ceases to be perceptible. This may be\r\nreadily known, either by applying a mirror or any polished surface to the\r\noutlet, or by calculating the quantity of moisture removed from the wood,\r\nwhich will be found to range between ¼ and ⅟12th of its whole weight.\r\nFor the purpose of ascertaining more correctly the amount of moisture\r\nremoved from time to time, when the wood is placed in seasoning chambers\r\nas already described, an opening should be constructed in the chamber,\r\nin any convenient position, through which a specimen of the wood may be\r\nwithdrawn and weighed.\r\n\r\nBetween 1848 and 1853, Mr. Bethell, who had paid much attention to the\r\nsubject, obtained several patents, both in England and France, for stoves\r\nfor drying wood. In his English patent of 1848, and the subsequent French\r\none of 1853, we find a description of a peculiar kind of stove, on the\r\nfollowing plan:\r\n\r\nIt consisted of a rectangular chamber formed of three walls and vaulted\r\nover, the whole in brickwork, with a certain thickness of slag in the\r\ncentre, to prevent loss of heat. One extremity of the chamber was open to\r\nadmit of the introduction of the wood by means of a truck running upon\r\nlongitudinal iron rails. The opening was closed with a double door when\r\nthe chamber was full. On the exterior of the opposite end of the chamber\r\nwas a furnace to burn coal, coke, wood, or tar, according as it was\r\ndesired to _dry_ the wood simply, or, in the words of the inventor, to\r\n_smoke_ it, i. e., to impregnate it with the antiseptic gaseous matters\r\nevolved in the imperfect combustion of certain tarry substances. The\r\nheated air or smoke entered through a flue running along the floor and\r\nbranching at the end, and it escaped, or was pumped out, at the top of\r\nthe vaults. Bethell considered that the interior of the chamber should be\r\nkept at a temperature of 110° Fahr., and that the duration of the process\r\nshould be regulated by the condition of the wood. His experiments showed\r\nthat this time varied from eight to twelve hours, the rapidity being\r\nattained at the cost of a relatively large expenditure of fuel. In point\r\nof fact, the draught was too great to permit of the utilization of the\r\nfull amount of heat contained in the gaseous matter, which escaped at a\r\ntemperature very little below that at which it entered. The heat produced\r\nby the fuel was badly utilized, and it is open to question whether,\r\nunder any circumstances, large pieces of wood, such as sleepers, could\r\nbe dried in so short a time as eight or twelve hours. The drying could\r\nonly be effected by the use of a very high degree of temperature, tending\r\nto split the wood and weaken its strength. This view was confirmed by\r\nthe results obtained in a long series of experiments made, in 1852-3,\r\nby an English manufacturing company, known as the Desiccating Company. A\r\nlow temperature, and long continuance of the drying process, appear to\r\nbe the conditions essential to the success of artificial desiccation,\r\nparticularly with wood intended for cabinet-making, turning, joinery,\r\nornamental work, &c., in which it is desirable, as far as possible,\r\nto prevent splitting, warping, and other changes of structure in\r\nthe material. These results, it would seem, were not secured by the\r\narrangements above described.\r\n\r\nSome years since, a stove was constructed for Messrs. S. and J. Holme,\r\nvery extensive builders at Liverpool, for the purpose of drying timber\r\nfor floors, and other fittings of houses, &c., by the application of\r\nMessrs. Price and Manby’s patent warming apparatus; the want of seasoned\r\ntimber, with the great number of men they employed, being a serious\r\ninconvenience and loss. In their large undertakings Messrs. Holme found\r\na difficulty in keeping a stock of dry timber. The dimensions of the\r\nstove in which the timber was to be dried was 43 feet long, 11 feet\r\nwide, and 17 feet 6 inches high, and the cost of the apparatus was about\r\n150_l_. It was calculated to hold about 30,000 superficial feet of 1-inch\r\nboards, which, upon the steam-pipe system, occupied full three weeks\r\nin drying. This apparatus of Messrs. Price and Manby, with rather less\r\nfuel, was considered to thoroughly dry each stove-full in ten days, thus\r\nsaving a consumption of ten days’ fuel, independent of the advantages\r\nof expediting business. The average temperature was 104°, and as the\r\ncontinuous stream of pure air passing between the metallic plates was\r\ndivested of its moisture, it carried off the dampness of the timber in\r\nan imperceptible manner. An experiment was tried, by having a flooring\r\nbatten, 7 inches by 1¼ inch, cut from a piece of timber which had been\r\nfloated, and was as full of water as it could be, placed in the stove;\r\nand when the temperature was 102°, it remained there five days, and when\r\nsawn down into ⅝ inch thick, and planed, it was found to be perfectly dry\r\nthroughout. The heat was so gentle, and the evaporation so equal, that\r\nthe timber was never rent, as when exposed to the air and a hot sun: in\r\nshort, Messrs. Holme considered it one of the most perfect timber stoves\r\nthat had been made.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked with respect to desiccation, that the timber to be\r\nartificially dried is generally exposed to a great heat for a short\r\ntime, rather than to a moderate heat for a lengthened one; and the air,\r\nsaturated with the vapour thus produced, is generally very imperfectly\r\nremoved. Wood so treated is almost sure to split, from the unequal\r\ncontraction to which it is exposed; and the pores are also very liable to\r\nreopen on the wood being withdrawn from the stove, because there is no\r\ngradual and permanent change in their mechanical structure. It is only\r\nwithin the last few years past that the artificial desiccation of wood,\r\nbefore its impregnation with an antiseptic preparation in closed vessels,\r\nhas been frequently adopted in practice.\r\n\r\nWe cannot give a better termination to the few remarks we have made about\r\n“steaming and boiling timber,” than by quoting the opinion of the late\r\nSir Charles Barry, R.A., architect to the new Houses of Parliament, which\r\nwe propose doing in the following manner:\r\n\r\n                               “YORK ROAD, LAMBETH, _Nov. 30, 1844_.\r\n\r\n    SIR,\r\n\r\n    In reply to your application, we beg to acquaint you that we\r\n    are willing to undertake the ordinary works required in the\r\n    finishings of the new Palace of Westminster. … The wainscot to\r\n    be used in the joiner’s work is assumed to be from the best\r\n    Crown Riga wainscot in the logs, and from pipe-staves of the\r\n    best quality, in equal proportions, to be _prepared for use by\r\n    steaming_, or otherwise.…\r\n\r\n                                                  _Grissell & Peto._”\r\n\r\n    Charles Barry, Esq.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Barry recommended this tender to the Treasury for acceptance;\r\nbut we fancy that he was doubtful about the efficacy of steaming, as we\r\nthink will appear from the following extract from an “Agreement between\r\nSir Charles Barry and Messrs. Grissell and Peto, builders:\r\n\r\n“_First._ That the wainscot is assumed to be from the log and pipe-staves\r\nin equal quantities; the prime cost of which, in inch boards, _seasoned\r\nby steam_, or other artificial means, so as to be fit for use, is\r\ncalculated at 6½_d._ per foot superficial.\r\n\r\n“_Secondly._ That _if it should be found necessary to make use of\r\nthoroughly dry wainscot boards_ for the whole or any portion of\r\nthe joiner’s work, seasoned by natural means (viz. exposure to the\r\natmosphere), the prime cost of such boards, with the addition of a\r\nprofit of 7½ per cent., is to be allowed for them, over and above the\r\nprice of 6½_d._ per foot superficial, the prime cost of wainscot boards\r\nprovided for in the contract, as above stated.” (Italics are our own.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSEASONING BY SMOKE DRYING.\r\n\r\nSmoke drying in an open chamber, or the burning of furze, fern, shavings,\r\nor straw under the wood, is said to give it hardness and durability;\r\nand, by rendering it bitter, destroys and prevents worms. It also\r\ndestroys the germ of any fungus which may have commenced. It is an old\r\nand well-founded observation that smoke drying contributes much to the\r\nhardness and durability of woods. Virgil appears to have been aware of\r\nits utility, when he wrote the passage which is thus translated by Dryden:\r\n\r\n    “Of beech, the plough-tail, and the bending yoke,\r\n    Or softer linden, hardened in the smoke.”--GEORGICS, i., 225.\r\n\r\nBeckman, in his ‘History of Inventions,’ quotes a passage from Hesiod to\r\nthe same effect; and adds, “as the houses of the ancients were so smoky,\r\nit may be easily comprehended how, by means of smoke, they could dry and\r\nharden pieces of timber.” In this manner were prepared the pieces of wood\r\ndestined for ploughs, waggons, and the rudders of vessels:\r\n\r\n    “These long suspend, where smoke their strength explores,\r\n    And seasons into use, and binds their pores.”--VIRGIL.\r\n\r\nThe late Brigadier-General Sir Samuel Bentham bestowed much time and\r\nattention in endeavouring to ascertain the quickest and best means of\r\ndrying oak. In his letter to the Navy Board, 6th March, 1812, he says:\r\n“By exposing block shells to the smoke of burning wood, they become in\r\nthe course of two or three days well seasoned in every respect, hard,\r\nbright coloured, and, as it were, polished. But it was found in a very\r\nshort time that the acid with which the shells were thus impregnated very\r\nrapidly corroded the iron pins which passed through them.\r\n\r\n“In Russia many small articles, such as parts of wheels, wheel carriages,\r\nand sledges, are prepared in this manner; so are wheels, at least in some\r\nparts of America; and sabots and other small articles in France.”\r\n\r\nIn speaking of artificial heat, he says, in the same letter:\r\n\r\n“From all the opportunities I have had of examining the state of timber\r\nso prepared by artificial heat, the due seasoning without cracking has\r\nappeared to depend on the ventilation happening to be _constant_, but\r\nvery _slow_, joined to such a due regulation of the heat as that the\r\n_interior_ of the timber should dry, and keep pace in its contraction\r\nwith the outer circles.”\r\n\r\nMr. T. W. Silloway, in ‘American Carpentry,’ remarks: “If timber be dried\r\nby heat, the outside will become hardened, and the pores closed, so that\r\nmoisture, instead of passing out, will be retained within.”\r\n\r\nBowden remarks, “that the timbers of a small ship underwent the process\r\nof charring, either by suspending them over a fire of chips, or by\r\nburning the exterior with red-hot irons, so as to char the external\r\nsurface. Air trunks were also formed between the timbers, for the\r\npurpose of evaporating moisture. The state of this vessel was examined\r\nfive years after she was launched, and it appeared that, although the\r\ntimbers had been very strongly charred, fungi had grown to a considerable\r\nextent on both sides abaft the fore channels, and that the plank near the\r\nmagazine was completely decayed.” _The power of vegetation broke through\r\nthe incrusted barrier against external affection._\r\n\r\nA method is in operation at Tourlaville, near Cherbourg, for which the\r\ninventor, M. Guibert, has taken out a patent, and it is said to give at\r\nonce more expeditious and sure results than those obtained from the use\r\nof dry and hot air. It consists in filling the drying-stove with smoke,\r\nproduced by the distillation of certain combustible matters, such as\r\nsawdust, waste tan, and smiths’ coals, &c. By means of a ventilator,\r\ningeniously arranged, a rotatory movement round the logs laid to season\r\nis given to the smoke, so as to obtain an average uniform temperature in\r\nevery part. By this plan, as the distillation of combustibles is always\r\nattended with a considerable discharge of steam, all cracks and splits\r\nare said to be prevented.\r\n\r\nThere is much force in Sir Samuel Bentham’s observations respecting the\r\ndrying of timber by artificial heat: it is certainly not well to attempt\r\nto dry it _too_ quickly, for if it be subjected to great heat, a large\r\nportion of the carbon will pass off, and thereby weaken the timber.\r\nTimber too suddenly dried cracks badly, and is thus materially injured:\r\nplanks of larch or beech are liable to warp and twist if their drying is\r\nhastened.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOVE DRYING.\r\n\r\nIn some of the large manufactories for cabinet work, the premises are\r\nheated by steam pipes, in which case they have a close stove in every\r\nworkshop heated many degrees beyond the general temperature, for giving\r\nthe final seasoning to the wood; for heating the cauls; and for warming\r\nthe glue, which is then done by opening a small steam pipe into the outer\r\nvessel of the glue-pot. The arrangement is extremely clean, safe from\r\nfire, and the degree of heat is very much under control.\r\n\r\nIn some manufactories, the wood is placed for a few days before it is\r\nworked up in a drying-room heated by means of stoves, steam or hot water,\r\nto several degrees beyond the temperature to which the finished work\r\nis likely to be subjected. Such rooms are frequently made as air-tight\r\nas possible, which appears to be a mistake,[1] as the wood is then\r\nsurrounded by a warm but stagnant atmosphere, which retains whatever\r\nmoisture it may have evaporated from the wood.\r\n\r\nFire-stoves for drying the timber were placed in the magazine,\r\nbread-room, and other parts of the ‘Royal Charlotte’ ship; and the evil\r\nof this practice was soon shown, for the vessel became dry rotten in\r\n_twelve months_.[2]\r\n\r\nWood sometimes undergoes a baking process for veneering. Fourcroy has\r\nrecommended baking timber in an oven, and he has asserted that it would\r\nrender timber more durable; “but,” says Boyden, “it should be subjected\r\nto a very strong heat, lest in endeavouring to prevent vegetation,\r\nwe should give it birth.” Captain Shaw[3] observes: “Any artificial\r\nheating which burns the air is most injurious to wood and all combustible\r\nmaterials, and renders them much more inflammable than they would be if\r\nonly exposed to the temperature of the atmosphere.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSEASONING BY SCORCHING AND CHARRING.\r\n\r\nScorching and charring are good for preventing and destroying infection\r\nin timber, but have to be done slowly, and only to timber that is\r\nalready thoroughly seasoned; otherwise, by incrusting the surface,\r\nthe evaporation of any internal moisture is intercepted, and decay in\r\nthe heart soon ensues; if done hastily, cracks are also caused on the\r\nsurface, and which, receiving from the wood a moisture for which there is\r\nnot a sufficient means of evaporation, renders it soon liable to decay.\r\nCharring has little or no control over internal corruption, though it is\r\na good preventive against external infection: it increases the durability\r\nof dry, but promotes the decay of wet timber. Farmers very often resort\r\nto this method for the preservation of their fence-posts; the charring\r\nshould extend a little above their contact with the ground. Unless they\r\ndiscriminate between green and unseasoned timber, these operations will\r\nprove injurious instead of beneficial.\r\n\r\nWe have already quoted Sir Charles Barry in favour of _steaming_ wood;\r\nwe now intend giving the opinion of a former pupil of his with regard to\r\n_charring_ it. Mr. George Vulliamy, architect to the Metropolitan Board\r\nof Works, in a specification for oak fencing which was fixed round the\r\nboundaries of Finsbury Park, London, in 1867, writes as follows:--“Dig\r\nout the ground for the upright standards where shall be directed, and\r\nfill in and ram round same with dry burnt earth, stones, and rubbish (the\r\nburnt clay will be provided); enclose the boundaries of Park, as shall be\r\ndirected, with _dry and well-seasoned_ heart of English oak, _wrought_\r\nupright standards, 6 inches by 5 inches, and 8 feet 6 inches total\r\nlength, with cut and _splayed_ tops, holes drilled for oak pins, and\r\nmortised for horizontal rails, as shown on detailed drawings; to stand 5\r\nfeet 3 inches out of ground, and _the ends in ground to be well charred\r\nbefore fixing_.” (The italics are our own.)\r\n\r\nOur ancestors used charcoal and charred wood, on account of their\r\ndurability, for landmarks in the ground between estates. The\r\nincorruptibility of charcoal is well known. Amongst other advantages,\r\nrats will not touch it; neither will the white ants nor cockroaches, so\r\ncommon in the Indies, commit their depredations where charring has been\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Revue Horticole’ states that it has been proved by recent\r\nexperiments, that the best mode of prolonging the duration of wood is to\r\nchar it, and then paint it over with three or four coats of pitch. Many\r\nof the sleepers now laid down on the Belgian railways are charred, the\r\nengineers preferring this process to any other.\r\n\r\nThe superficial carbonization, or charring of wood, as a preservative\r\nmeans, has long been practised. The Venetians have used charring for\r\ntimber for a long period, particularly for piles. In France, M. de\r\nLapparent recently proposed to apply it to the timber used in the French\r\nNavy. Some experiments, which were undertaken with a view to determine\r\nits practicability, terminated satisfactorily; and the Minister of Marine\r\nordered the process to be introduced into the Imperial dockyards.\r\n\r\nM. de Lapparent makes use of a gas blowpipe, the flame from which is\r\nallowed to play upon every part of the piece of timber in succession.\r\nBy this means the degree of torrefaction may be regulated at will. The\r\nmethod is applicable to woodwork of all kinds; and the charring, it is\r\nsaid, does not destroy the sharpness of any mouldings with which the wood\r\nmay be ornamented.\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Journal des Savants,’ Feb. 15, 1666, appears the following: “The\r\nPortugals scorch their ships, insomuch that in the quick works there is a\r\ncoaly crust of about an inch thick; but this is dangerous, it happening,\r\nnot seldom, that the whole vessel is burnt.” It is no wonder that the\r\nPortuguese ships should frequently fire in the operation, as their plank\r\nwas charred an inch deep. A mere charring, if done properly, after the\r\ntimbers had been thoroughly seasoned by air, would have been sufficient.\r\n\r\nCharring seasoned wood is known to be a most effectual mode of\r\npreservation against rot in timber: thus do piles, when charred, last for\r\nages in water or moist soil. Charred wood has been dug up, which must\r\nhave lain in the ground for 1500 years, and was then found perfectly\r\nsound. After the Temple of Diana, at Ephesus, was destroyed, it was\r\nfound to have been built on charred piles; and at Herculaneum, after 2000\r\nyears, the charred wood was found to be whole and undiminished. But we\r\nfind Sir Christopher Wren did not approve of charred piles, except in a\r\nsoil where they would be constantly wet. So, in order to attain a firmer\r\nfoundation for St. Paul’s Cathedral, he had the ground excavated to an\r\nimmense depth before a stone of the building was laid.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial it has been the practice, particularly in France,\r\nto burn the ends of the poles driven into the ground to preserve them\r\nfrom decay. According to the remark of the celebrated Carlomb, we should\r\nalways take into serious consideration old and well-known customs; but in\r\nthis instance it is easy to admit the preserving effect of carbonization.\r\nMr. James Randall,[4] Architect, states that he “oxidated several\r\npieces of wood with nitric acid, and with fire,” and these processes\r\nwere attended with success. Nearly the last sentence in his work is,\r\n“_oxidation only_ can be relied on, in all cases, as an effectual cure.”\r\n\r\nIn charring, the surface of the timber is subjected to a considerable\r\nheat, the primary effect of which is to exhaust the sap of the epidermis,\r\nand to dry up the fermenting principles. Here this is done by long\r\nexposure to the air; and, in the second place, below the outside layer\r\ncompletely carbonized, a scorched surface is found, that is to say,\r\npartly distilled and impregnated with the products of that distillation,\r\nwhich is creosoted; the antiseptic properties of which are well known.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Binmer was examined before the Commissioners of Woods, Forests,\r\n&c., in 1792, he stated “that all steamed plank should be afterwards\r\ndried and _burnt_ to extract the moisture.”\r\n\r\nTo a spontaneous carbonization must be attributed also the\r\nunchangeableness of that timber entirely black, which is met with\r\neverywhere in digging up the ground, where it has laid buried for ages.\r\nIn the neighbourhood of St. Malo, France, these specimens are very\r\ncommon, and there most of the espaliers and vine props are made of wood,\r\nblack as ebony, and famous for its durability. They have been cut from\r\nthe trees of an old forest, submerged in the eighth century by an inroad\r\nof the sea, which formerly crossed a Roman road, leading from Brittany to\r\nCotentin.\r\n\r\nNot long after the beginning of the eighteenth century, the method of\r\nheating or charring timber, before it was worked up, and also that of\r\nstoving--that is, of heating in kilns with sand--were practised in\r\nthe Royal dockyards. The ‘Royal William,’ one of the most remarkable\r\ninstances of durability that the British Navy has supplied, was built\r\neither wholly or in part of timber that had been charred. It was launched\r\nin 1719; never repaired until 1757; and then, when surveyed afloat, in\r\n1785, it appeared that the thick stuff and plank had been _burnt_ instead\r\nof being _kilned_; and that the ends of the beams, the faying parts of\r\nthe breast-hooks, crutches, resters, knees, &c., had been gouged in a\r\nmanner then practised, which was called _snail-creeping_; by means of\r\nwhich the air was conveyed to the different parts of the ship.[5]\r\n\r\nThe reason this method has not been persevered in, but nearly abandoned,\r\nis owing to many causes: the difficulty and danger of the means adopted\r\nfor charring, when either straw, fern, or shavings are made use of; the\r\nserious objection of burning the timber too deeply; or the encumbrance\r\nof the apparatus, and the length of time occupied, if sand-kilns\r\nsufficiently heated are used; and, finally, to indifference, or that\r\nsystem of routine, against which the wisest plans often contend in vain.\r\n\r\nIn house-building, the charring process should be applied to the beams\r\nand joists embedded in the walls, or surrounded with plaster; to the\r\njoists of stables, washhouses, &c., which, although exposed to the free\r\nair, are constantly surrounded by a warm and moist atmosphere, an active\r\ncause of fermentation; to the wainscotting of ground floors; to the\r\nflooring beneath parquet work; to the joints of tongues and rabbets;\r\nfor carbonization by means of gas still leaves to the wood, for working\r\npurposes, all the sharpness of its edges. Charring is particularly useful\r\nin the junction of all broad surfaces, and more essentially in those\r\nwhich are cut either transverse or oblique to the grain of the wood,\r\nas the sap vessels are then exposed to the absorption of moisture. The\r\nbutts of timbers are peculiarly liable to rot, because of affording a\r\nlodgment for moisture without a free passage for air. No seasoned timber\r\nshould have its tubular parts exposed, nor should any timber have the saw\r\nmarks upon it, because the torn filaments absorb and retain moisture.\r\nAllusion has already been made to the process adopted, near Cherbourg,\r\nfor preventing the decay of timber by means of gas.\r\n\r\nBy carbonization, a practical and economical means is afforded to railway\r\ncompanies of preserving, almost for ever, the sleepers, and particularly\r\noak, which cannot be impregnated easily by the injection of mineral\r\nsalts. Let us suppose, for instance, that after, say ten or fifteen\r\nyears, the sleepers on a line are taken up for the length of a mile,\r\nand replaced by new ones; the old, when rasped and burnt again, will\r\nserve for the replacing the following mile, and so on, one mile after\r\nthe other. It might be equally serviceable to apply the same process to\r\ninjected beech, for the reason that it is almost impossible to make the\r\npreserving liquid penetrate thoroughly the mass of the timber.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEASONING BY EXTRACTION OF SAP.\r\n\r\nMr. John Stephen Langton’s method of seasoning by extraction of the\r\nsap was patented in 1825, but is now almost wholly discontinued. It\r\nconsists in letting the timber into vertical iron cylinders, standing in\r\na cistern of water, closing the cylinders at top; and the water being\r\nheated, and steam used to produce a partial vacuum, the sap relieved\r\nfrom the atmospheric pressure oozes from the wood, and being converted\r\ninto vapour, passes off through a pipe provided for the purpose. The\r\ntime required is about ten weeks, and the cost is about ten shillings\r\nper load; but the sap is wholly extracted, and the timber is said to\r\nbe fit and ready for any purpose; the diminution of weight is, with a\r\nlittle more shrinkage, similar to that in seasoning by the common natural\r\nprocess.[6]\r\n\r\nMr. Barlow’s patent provided for exhausting the air from one end of\r\nthe log while one or more atmospheres press upon the other end. This\r\nartificial aerial circulation through the wood is prolonged at pleasure.\r\nHowever excellent in theory, this process is not practicable.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1844, M. Tissier proposed to place wood in a close vessel,\r\nand subject it to a current of hot dry air; and in 1847, Mr. Miller\r\nproposed to inject hot air through beams of wood to drive out the sap.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, M. Meyer d’Uslaw proposed to first dilate the pores of the wood\r\nwith steam, and then place it in a hermetically closed chamber, and make\r\na vacuum there.\r\n\r\nThe following system of preparing timber for the Navy was, not many years\r\nsince, adopted in South Russia. A full account of the practice will be\r\nfound in Oliphant’s ‘Russian Shores of the Black Sea,’ 1853. The only\r\nname we can give it is\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘SEASONING’ BY BRIBES.”\r\n\r\nA certain quantity of well-seasoned oak being required, Government issues\r\ntenders for the supply of the requisite amount. A number of contractors\r\nsubmit their tenders to a board appointed for the purpose of receiving\r\nthem, who are regulated in the choice of a contractor not by the amount\r\nof his tender, but of his bribe. The _fortunate_ individual selected\r\nimmediately sub-contracts upon a somewhat similar principle. Arranging\r\nto be supplied with the timber for half the amount of his tender, the\r\nsub-contractor carries on the game, and perhaps the eighth link in this\r\ncontracting chain is the man who, for an absurdly low figure, undertakes\r\nto produce the _seasoned_ wood.\r\n\r\nHis agents in the central provinces accordingly float a quantity of\r\ngreen pines and firs down the Dnieper and Bog to Nicholaeff, which are\r\nduly handed up to the head contractor, each man pocketing the difference\r\nbetween his contract and that of his neighbour. When the wood is produced\r\nbefore the board appointed to inspect it, another bribe _seasons_ it; and\r\nthe Government, after paying the price of well-seasoned oak, is surprised\r\nthat the 120-gun ship, which it has been built of it, is unfit for\r\nservice in five years.\r\n\r\n    “Mark but my fall, and that that ruin’d me,\r\n    Corruption.”--SHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\nA few words can only be given to a most important matter, viz., the\r\n_second seasoning_, which many woods require. If floor-boards are only\r\nlaid down at first on the joists of a building, and at the expiration of\r\none year wedged tight and nailed down, those unsightly openings caused\r\nby shrinkage, which form a harbour for dirt and vermin, will be avoided,\r\nas the wood will have had an opportunity of shrinking. Doors, sashes,\r\narchitraves in long lengths, will also be better if made up some time\r\nbefore they are required for use. Many Indian woods require a second\r\nseasoning--kara mardá, for instance, a favourite wood with Indian railway\r\nengineers. Even sál and teak are not exempt. Teak shrinks sideways least\r\nof all woods. In the ‘Tortoise,’ store ship, when fifty years old, no\r\nopenings were found to exist between the boards; yet Colonel Lloyd says\r\nhe found the teak timbers used by him in constructing a large room in\r\nthe Mauritius to have shrunk ¾ of an inch in 38 feet. Thus a space of ⅜\r\nof an inch must have been left at each end of the beam, where moisture\r\ncould lodge and fungi exist, obtaining their nourishment from the wood.\r\nIf unseasoned teak is used for ships, dry rot will in time find a place.\r\nIt may be said that teak is a very hard wood, and very durable; yet “the\r\nmills of the gods,” says an ancient philosopher, “grind slow, very slow,\r\nbut they grind to powder;” _and so do the fungi mills_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nON SEASONING TIMBER BY PATENT PROCESSES, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong years of practical experience has shown that timber, however prone\r\nto dry or wet rot, may be preserved from both by the use of certain\r\nmetallic solutions, or other suitable protective matters.\r\n\r\nAll the various processes may be said somewhat to reduce the transverse\r\nstrength of the timber when dry, and the metallic salts are affected\r\nat the iron bolts or fastenings. The natural juices of some woods do\r\nthis; and bolts which have united beams of elm and pitch pine will often\r\ncorrode entirely away at the junction.\r\n\r\nThe processes adopted for resisting the chemical changes in the tissues\r\nof the wood are all founded on the principle that it is essential to\r\ninject some material which shall at once precipitate the coaguable\r\nportion of the albumen retained in the tissues of the wood in a\r\npermanent insoluble form, so that it will not hereafter be susceptible\r\nof putrefactive decomposition. For this purpose, many substances, many\r\nsolutions, have been employed with variable success, but materials have\r\nbeen sometimes introduced for this purpose which produced an effect just\r\nthe opposite to what was anticipated.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that timber is permeable, at least by aqueous\r\nsolutions, only so long as the sap channels are free from incrustation.\r\n\r\nSuch in general is the case with beech, elm, poplar, and hornbeam, the\r\ncapillary tubes of which are always open, or, at least, close very\r\nslowly. At the same time it may be said that there must remain ever in\r\nthese species some parts impervious to injection, whilst it is almost\r\nimpossible but that a certain portion of the fibres will be more or less\r\nincrusted. The sap woods, on the other hand, of every species appear\r\nquite pervious.\r\n\r\nVery little is known of any preservative process adopted in ancient\r\ntimes. Pliny observes that the ancients used garlic boiled in vinegar\r\nwith considerable success, especially with reference to preserving timber\r\nfrom worms: he also states that the oil of cedar will protect any timber\r\nanointed with it from worm and rottenness. Oil of cedar was used by the\r\nancient Egyptians for preserving their mummies. Tar and linseed oil were\r\nalso recommended by him. The image of the goddess Diana, at Ephesus,\r\nwas saturated with olive and cedar oils; also the image of Jupiter, at\r\nRome; and the statues of Minerva and Bacchus were impregnated with oil of\r\nspikenard.\r\n\r\nThe idea of preserving wood by the action of oil is therefore by no means\r\nnew; but it is somewhat curious that the earliest modern processes should\r\nalso be by means of oil. The _oils most proper_ to be used are _linseed_,\r\n_rapeseed_, or almost any of the vegetable fixed oils. Oak wood, rendered\r\nentirely free from moisture, and then immersed in linseed oil, is said\r\nto be thus prevented from splitting: the time of immersion depending on\r\nthe size, &c. Palm oil is preferable to whale oil, because impregnation\r\nwith the latter, although in many instances eligible, causes wood to\r\nbecome brittle. It is, however, probable that whale oil, when combined\r\nwith other substances, such as litharge, coal pitch, or charcoal,\r\nmay lose much of that effect. As cocoa-nut oil, which is, under low\r\ntemperature, like the oil expressed from the nuts of the palm tree, is\r\nknown to be highly preservative of timber and metallic fastenings, we may\r\nexpect the same result from the latter, and thereby avoid that extreme\r\ndryness and brittleness of the timber which Mr. Strange complained of\r\nin the Venetian ships that had been seasoned for many years in frame\r\nunder cover. Cocoa-nut oil beat up with shell lime or _chunam_, so as to\r\nbecome putty, and afterwards diluted with more oil, is used at Bombay and\r\nelsewhere as a preservative coat or varnish to plank. It cannot become\r\na varnish without the addition of some essential oil; and the oil of\r\nmustard is used; which, of course, will produce the desired effect. In\r\nthe first volume of the Abbé Raynal, on the European settlements in the\r\nEast and West Indies, he mentions that an oil was exported from Pegu for\r\nthe preservation of ships; but as he does not say what oil, no conclusion\r\ncan be drawn further than as to the probability of its being one of those\r\nalready noticed.\r\n\r\nExperience has proved that even _animal oils_ are so far injurious\r\nto timber as to _render it brittle_, whilst they preserve it from\r\nrottenness; and that, on the other hand, a mineral salt more or less\r\ncombined with fatty substances does not produce that effect. The staves\r\nof whale-oil casks become quite brittle, whilst those of beef, pork,\r\nand tallow barrels remain tough and sound. Ships _constantly_ in the\r\nGreenland trade have their timbers and planks preserved so far as they\r\nhave become impregnated with whale oil.\r\n\r\nExperiments with fish oil prove that of itself, unless exposed to sun and\r\nair, it may be injurious; that it loosens the cohesion of timber; but\r\nthat _animal fat_, combined _with saline matter_, _is preservative_.\r\n\r\nFish oil used alone is ineligible, because capable of running into the\r\nputrefactive process, unless as a thin outside varnish. In hard, sound\r\ntimber, it will hardly enter at all; and if poured into bore-holes in the\r\nheads of timbers, it will insinuate itself into the smallest rents or\r\ncracks, and waste through them. Used alone, or with any admixture, it is\r\nabsorbed and dried quickly on wood in a decomposing state or commencing\r\nto be dry rotten. Used with litharge, it dries after some days; but\r\nwith lamp-black it has scarcely so much tendency to dry as when used\r\nalone. Paint of fish oil and charcoal dries very quickly where there is\r\nabsorption, and the charcoal extends its oxidating or drying effect to\r\nthe fish oil in its vicinity.\r\n\r\nWe give the following to prove what we have written, and also to serve as\r\nan example for those who wish to try experiments:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    EXPERIMENTS ON FISH OIL.\r\n\r\n    June 9.--Upon a piece of old oak scantling, with its alburnam\r\n    on one side in a state of decay, fish oil was poured several\r\n    times, viz. on this day, on June 25, and July 3, which it rapidly\r\n    absorbed in the decayed part.\r\n\r\n    July 26.--It was payed (or mopped) with fish oil and charcoal\r\n    powder, and the following day it was put under an inverted cask.\r\n\r\n    October 1.--The end of this piece was covered with a greenish\r\n    mould. _This proves that fish oil must be injurious, except where\r\n    exposed to sun and air to dry it._\r\n\r\nA compound of fixed oils and charcoal is liable to inflame, but as a thin\r\ncovering or pigment it may not be so.\r\n\r\nThe _petroleum_ oil-wells, near Prome, in Burmah, have been in use from\r\ntime immemorial. Wood, both for ship-building and house-building, is\r\ninvariably saturated or coated with the product of those wells; and\r\nit is stated that the result is _entire immunity from decay_ and the\r\nravages of the white ant. At Marseilles, and some other ports in the\r\nMediterranean, it used to be the practice to run the petroleum, which\r\nis obtained near the banks of the Rhone, into the vacancies between the\r\ntimbers of the vessels, to give them durability. It was sometimes, for\r\nthe conjoint purpose of giving stability and duration to vessels, mixed\r\nwith coarse sand or other extraneous matters, and run in whilst hot\r\nbetween the ceiling and bottom plank, where it filled up the vacancies\r\nbetween the timbers in the round of their bottoms, excepting where\r\nnecessary to be prevented. The great objection to the use of petroleum is\r\nits inflammability. _Creosote_, its great rival for wood preserving, is\r\nalso inflammable, and not so agreeable in colour; but it is _considerably\r\ncheaper_, which is an important matter.\r\n\r\nAs we are now about to enter upon the subject of patent processes, &c.,\r\nit appears desirable to lay down certain principles at the commencement,\r\nin order to assist the reader as much as possible.\r\n\r\nAlmost every chemical principle or compound of any plausibility has been\r\nsuggested in the course of the last hundred and fifty years; but the\r\nmultiplicity and contradiction of opinions form nearly an inextricable\r\nlabyrinth. To commence.\r\n\r\n1st. It seems obvious that _the sooner the sap is wholly removed from the\r\nwood the better_, _provided the woody fibre solidifies without injury_.\r\n\r\n2nd. That _the wood should be impregnated with any strongly antiseptic\r\nand non-deliquescent matter_, _which must necessarily be in solution when\r\nit enters the wood_. No deliquescent remedy is eligible, because moisture\r\nis injurious to metallic fastenings.\r\n\r\n3rd. _The wood should be first dried, and its pores then closed with\r\nany substance impervious to air and moisture, and at the same time\r\nhighly repellant to putrescency._ The most essential requisites in a\r\npreservative of timber being a disposition to _dryness_, and a tendency\r\nto resist _combustion_ as far as consistently obtainable.\r\n\r\n4th. _Any process to be successful ought not to be tedious, very\r\ndifficult, or too expensive._ These are important elements in the success\r\nof any patent.\r\n\r\nVery little is known of any preservative process previous to the year\r\n1717, when directions were given by the Navy authorities to _boil_\r\ntreenails, and dry them before they were used. But whether the custom had\r\nprevailed before this time, or whether their strength and durability were\r\nincreased by it, there are no means of ascertaining. It does not appear\r\nthat any substance was put into the water to decompose the juices; but\r\nas they are soluble in warm water, perhaps the power of vegetation might\r\nhave been destroyed without it.\r\n\r\nIn 1737 Mr. Emerson patented a process of saturating timber with _boiled\r\noil_, mixed with poisonous substances; but his process was very little\r\nused. This, we believe, was the _first_ patent on wood preserving.\r\n\r\nAbout 1740, Mr. Reid proposed to arrest decay by means of a certain\r\n_vegetable acid_ (probably pyroligneous acid). The method of using it was\r\nby simple immersion.\r\n\r\nIn 1756, Dr. Hales recommended that the planks at the water-line of ships\r\nshould be soaked in _linseed oil_, to prevent the injury to which wood\r\nis subject when alternately exposed to wet and dry; and indeed, many\r\nships were built in which a hollow place was cut in one end of each beam\r\nor sternpost, which might constantly be kept filled with _train oil_.\r\nAmongst other ships so constructed, the ‘Fame,’ 74, may be mentioned.\r\nWhen, after some years, this ship was repaired, it was found that as\r\nfar as the oil had penetrated, namely, from 12 to 18 inches from the\r\nend, the wood was quite sound, whilst the other parts were more or less\r\ndecayed. The Americans used to hollow out the tops of their masts in the\r\nform of cups or basins; bore holes from the end a considerable way down\r\nthe masts; pour oil into these; cover them over with lead; and leave the\r\noil to find its way down the capillary vessels to the interior of the\r\ntimber.[7]\r\n\r\nIn 1769, Mr. Jackson, a London chemist, with a view to the prevention\r\nof decay, obtained permission to prepare some timber to be used in the\r\nnational yards, by immersing it in a solution of _salt water_, _lime_,\r\n_muriate of soda_, _potash_, _salts_, &c., the result of which dose was,\r\nthat several frigates in the Navy subjected to the process were rendered\r\nmore perishable than if they had been constructed of unprepared timber.\r\nThe solution was filtered into the wood partly by means of holes made in\r\nit. Chapman proposed a similar method of preserving the frames of ships,\r\nviz. by boring holes in the timbers, and pumping a _solution of copperas_\r\nin water into them. He believed every part of the vessel would thus be\r\nimpregnated.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson also prepared the frame of the ship ‘Intrepid’ with another\r\nsolution. The ship lasted many years. Bowden thought it was a _solution\r\nof glue_. Chapman suggested _slaked lime_, thinned with a weak _solution\r\nof glue_ for mopping the timbers of a ship.\r\n\r\nShortly after Mr. Jackson’s process was started, Mr. Lewis attempted\r\nto accomplish the preservation of timber by placing it surrounded by\r\npounded lime, in spaces below the “surface of the earth.” The use of lime\r\nhas also been advocated by Mr. Knowles, Secretary of the Committee of\r\nSurveyors of the Navy, who has written an able work on the ‘Means to be\r\ntaken to Preserve the British Navy from Dry Rot’ (1821).\r\n\r\nBetween 1768 and 1773 a practice prevailed of saturating ships with\r\ncommon salt; but this was found to cause a rapid corrosion of the iron\r\nfastenings, and to fill the vessels between decks with a constant damp\r\nvapour. In ‘Nicholson’s Journal,’ No. 30, there is an article signed\r\n_Nauticus_ on this subject. Vessel owners had long ago observed that\r\nthose ships which have early sailed with cargoes of salt are not attacked\r\nby dry rot. Indeed, several instances are attested of vessels whose\r\ninteriors were lined with fungi having all traces of the plant destroyed\r\nby accidental or intentional sinking in the sea. Acting on such hints,\r\na trader of Boston, U. S., salted his ships with 500 bushels of the\r\nchloride, disposed as an interior lining, adding 100 bushels at the end\r\nof two years. Such an addition of dead weight is sufficient objection to\r\na procedure which has other great disadvantages. Salt should never be\r\napplied as an antidote against the dry rot, on account of its natural\r\npowers of attracting moisture from the atmosphere, which would render\r\napartments almost uninhabitable, from their continual dampness. Those who\r\nhave lived for any length of time in a house at the sea-side, the mortar\r\nof which has been partly composed of sea sand, will have observed the\r\nmoist state of the paper, plastering, &c., in wet weather. Bricks made\r\nwith sea sand are objectionable.\r\n\r\n_Salt water_ seasoning has already been referred to in the last chapter,\r\nbut as it is so closely connected with salt seasoning, the further and\r\nfinal consideration of salt water seasoning may be fitly dealt with\r\nhere. Salt water will not extract the juices from the timber like fresh\r\nwater. It is only by destroying the vegetation that salt water can be\r\nadvantageous, but it would require a very long time to impregnate large\r\ntimber to the heart so as to destroy vegetation. It is well known that\r\nwood is softened, and in time decomposed, by extreme moisture. Fifty\r\nyears since, the master builder at Cronstadt complained that the oak from\r\nCasan, which was frequently wet from different causes in its passage of\r\nthree years to Cronstadt, was so water-soaked as never to dry; and also\r\nfrom the information of Mr. Strange, it appears “that the practice at\r\nVenice of the fresh-cut timber being thrown into salt water, prevents\r\nits ever becoming dry in the ships, and that the salt water rusted and\r\ncorroded the iron bolts.” In fine, vessels built with salt water seasoned\r\nwood are perfect hygrometers, being as sensible to the changes of the\r\nmoisture of the atmosphere as lumps of rock salt, or the plaster of\r\ninside walls where sea sand has been used.\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon, the timber of the female palm tree is much harder and blacker\r\nthan that of the male, inasmuch as it brings nearly triple its price.\r\nThe natives are so well aware of the difference that they resort to the\r\ndevise of immersing the male tree in _salt water_ to deepen its colour,\r\nas well as add to its weight.\r\n\r\nVessels impregnated with _bay salt_, or the large grained salt of\r\nLeamington or of Liverpool (pure muriate of soda), will possess decided\r\nadvantages; as also will vessels that have been laden with _saltpetre_,\r\nif it has been dispersed amongst their timbers.\r\n\r\nShips (the timbers of which had been previously immersed in salt water)\r\nhave been broken up after a few years’ service, and the floor timbers\r\ntaken out quite sound: but when exposed to the sun and rain in the summer\r\nmonths, their albumen has been in a decomposed or friable state.\r\n\r\nBy the answers to queries given to Mr. Strange, the British Minister at\r\nVenice, in or about 1792, it appears that several of the Venetian ships\r\nof war had then lain under sheds for fifty-nine years; some in bare\r\nframes, and others planked and caulked: that these ships show no outward\r\nmarks of decay; but their timbers have shrunk much, and _become brittle_;\r\nthat some of the most intelligent ship builders were of opinion that\r\ngreat prejudice had arisen from the prevalent custom of throwing the\r\ntimber fresh cut into salt water, and letting it lie there until wanted;\r\nthat afterwards it dried, and withered on the outside, under the sheds,\r\nwhile the inside, being soaked with salt water, rotted before it became\r\ndry; and this was one reason, amongst others, why Venetian ships, though\r\nbuilt of good timber, lasted so short a time; for the salt moisture not\r\nonly rots the inside of the beams and timbers, but of course rusts and\r\ncorrodes the iron bolts.\r\n\r\n_Salt water_, _sea-sand_, and _sea-weed_ are now used for seasoning\r\n“jarrah” wood in Western Australia. This wood is considered a first-class\r\nwood for ship-building, but it is somewhat slow to season, and if exposed\r\nbefore being seasoned it is apt to “fly” and cast. The method adopted\r\nis as follows: The logs are thrown into the sea, and left there for a\r\nfew weeks; they are then drawn up through the sand, and after being\r\ncovered with sea-weed a few inches deep, are left to lie on the beach,\r\ncare being taken to prevent the sun getting at their ends. The logs are\r\nthen left for many months to season. When taken up they are cut into\r\nboards 7 inches wide, and stacked, so as to admit of a free circulation\r\nof air round them, for five or six months before using them. Sea-weed or\r\nsea-ware, cast upon the shores, contains a small quantity of carbonate\r\nof soda, and a large proportion of nitrogenous and saline matters, with\r\nearthy salts, in a readily decomposable state. They also contain much\r\nsoluble mucilage. The practice of seasoning timber by heating it in a\r\n_sand bath_ was formerly adopted by the Dutch, and by the Russians in\r\nbuilding boats. Mr. Thomas Nichols (in a letter to Lord Chatham, when\r\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty) states “that the same end, viz. preservation\r\nof timber from decay, might probably be acquired by burying the timber in\r\nsand, which acts as an artificial sap,” in the same manner as mentioned\r\nin Townsend’s ‘Travels through Spain,’ to be used with the masts of ships\r\nof war at Cadiz.\r\n\r\n_Peat moss_ has been recommended (because the sulphates of iron, soda,\r\nand magnesia are found in it), but it failed when tried.\r\n\r\nWith reference to Mr. Lewis’s proposal to preserve wood by means of\r\nlime, it must be remembered that _quicklime_, with damp, has been found\r\nto accelerate putrefaction, in consequence of its extracting carbon;\r\nbut when dry, and in such large quantities as to absorb all moisture\r\nfrom the wood, _the wood is preserved_, _and the sap hardened_. Vessels\r\n_long_ in the lime trade have afforded proof of this fact; and we have\r\nalso examples in plastering-laths, which are generally found sound and\r\ngood in places where they have been dry. Whitewash or _limewater_ has\r\nbeen strongly recommended for use between the decks of ships, as being\r\nunfavourable to vegetation: it should be renewed at intervals of time,\r\naccording to circumstances. It has been applied with good effect to the\r\njoists and sleepers of kitchen floors; but to be effectual it should be\r\noccasionally renewed. Effete, or re-carbonated lime, is injurious to\r\ntimber, like other absorbent earths; so also are calcareous incrustations\r\nformed by the solution of lime in water, as appears from Von Buch’s\r\n‘Travels in Norway,’ in which he says, “that in the fishing country (near\r\nLofodden, beyond the Arctic circle) the calcareous incrustations brought\r\nby water, filtering through a bed of shells, soon cause the vessels and\r\nwood to be covered with and destroyed by green fungi.” The ends of joists\r\nof timber inserted in walls are frequently found rotten; and where not\r\nso, it may probably be owing to the mortar having been made with hot\r\nlime, and used immediately, or to the absence of moisture. It does not\r\nappear practicable to use limewater to any extent for preserving timber,\r\nbecause water holds in solution only about ⅟500th part of lime, which\r\nquantity would be too inconsiderable; it, however, renders timber more\r\ndurable, but at the same time very hard and difficult to be worked (p.\r\n73).\r\n\r\nVessels constantly in the _coal_ trade have generally required little\r\nrepair, and have lasted until in the common course of things they were\r\nlost by shipwreck. This must be owing to the martial pyrites which abound\r\nin all coals; and also from the sulphuric acid arising from the quantity\r\nof coal dust which finds its way through the seams of the ceiling, and\r\nadheres to the timber and planks.\r\n\r\nIn 1779, M. Pallas, in Russia, proposed to steep wood in _sulphate of\r\niron_ (green vitriol) until it had penetrated deeply, _and_ then in\r\n_lime_ to precipitate the vitriol. Neumann, in his first volume of\r\n‘Chemistry,’ on the article green vitriol, says, “That in the Swedish\r\ntransactions this salt is recommended for preserving wood, particularly\r\nthe wheels of carriages, from decay.\r\n\r\n“When all the pieces are fit for being joined together, they are directed\r\nto be boiled in a solution of vitriol for three or four hours, and then\r\nkept for some days in a warm place to dry. It is said that the wood\r\nby this preparation becomes so hard and compact that moisture cannot\r\npenetrate it, and that iron nails are not so apt to be destroyed in this\r\nvitriolated wood as might be expected, _but last as long as the wood\r\nitself_.”\r\n\r\nIn 1780 the marcasite termed by the miners _mundic_, found in great\r\nabundance in the tin mines in Devonshire and Cornwall, was employed, in\r\na state of fusion, to eradicate present and to prevent the future growth\r\nof dry rot; but whether its efficacy was proved by time is not known. A\r\ngarden walk where there are some pieces of mundic never has any weeds\r\ngrowing; the rain that falls becomes impregnated with its qualities, and\r\nin flowing through the walk prevents vegetation.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 Hales proposed to _creosote_ the treenails of ships: this was\r\nforty-two years previous to Bethell’s patent for creosoting wood.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1800, the Society of Arts’ building in the Adelphi,\r\nLondon, being attacked by dry rot, Dr. Higgins examined the timbers,\r\ncaused some to be removed and replaced by new, and the remainder to be\r\nscraped and washed with a solution of _caustic ammonia_, so as by burning\r\nthe surface of the wood to prevent the growth of fungi.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the present century, a member of the Royal Academy\r\nof Stockholm called attention to the use of _alum_ for preserving wood\r\nfrom fire. He says, in the Memoirs of that Academy, “Having been within\r\nthese few years to visit the alum mines of Loswers, in the province of\r\nCalmar, I took notice of some attempts made to burn the old staves of\r\ntubs and pails that had been used for the alum works. For this purpose\r\nthey were thrown into the furnace, but those pieces of wood which had\r\nbeen _penetrated_ by the alum did not burn, though they remained for\r\na long time in the fire, where they only became red; however, at last\r\nthey were consumed by the intenseness of the heat, but they yielded no\r\nflame.” He concludes, from this experiment, that wood or timber for the\r\npurpose of building may be secured against the action of fire by letting\r\nit remain for some time in water wherein vitriol, alum, or any other salt\r\nhas been dissolved which contains no inflammable parts.\r\n\r\nIn Sir John Pringle’s Tables of the antiseptic powers of different\r\nsubstances, he states _alum_ to be thirty times stronger than sea-salt;\r\nand by the experiments of the author of the ‘Essai pour servir à\r\nl’Histoire de la Putréfaction,’ metallic salts are much more antiseptic\r\nthan those with earthy bases.\r\n\r\nIn 1815 it occurred to Mr. Wade that it would be a good practice to fill\r\nthe pores of timber with _alumine_, or selenite; but two years after,\r\nChapman observed, “Impregnation of ships’ timbers with a _solution of\r\nalum_ occurred to me about twenty years since, because on immersion in\r\nsea-water the alumine would be deposited in the pores of the timber; but\r\nI was soon informed of its worse than inutility, by learning that the\r\n_experiment had been tried_, and, in place of preserving, had _caused the\r\nwood to rot speedily_. Impregnation with _selenite_ has been tried in elm\r\nwater-pipes. On precipitation from its solvent it partially filled the\r\npores, and hardened the wood, but _occasioned speedy rottenness_.” If,\r\nby using a _solution of alum_ to render wood uninflammable, we at the\r\nsame time cause it to _rot speedily_, it becomes a question _whether the\r\nremedy is not worse than the disease_. Captain E. M. Shaw, of the London\r\nFire Brigade, in his work, ‘Fire Surveys’ (1872), recommends _alum and\r\nwater_. Probably he only thought of fire, and not of rotting the wood.\r\nThe alum question does not appear to be yet satisfactorily settled.\r\n\r\nWhile upon the subject of uninflammable wood, we may state that in 1848,\r\nupon Putney Heath (near London), by the roadside, stood an obelisk, to\r\nrecord the success of a discovery made in the last century of the means\r\nof building a house which no ordinary application of ignited combustibles\r\ncould be made to consume: the obelisk was erected in 1786. The inventor\r\nwas Mr. David Hartley, to whom the House of Commons voted 2500_l._, to\r\ndefray the expenses of the experimental building, which stood about one\r\nhundred yards from the obelisk. The building was three stories high, and\r\ntwo rooms on a floor. In 1774, King George the Third and Queen Charlotte\r\ntook their breakfast in one of the rooms, while in the apartment beneath\r\nfires were lighted on the floor, and various inflammable materials were\r\nignited to attest that the rooms above were fire-proof. Hartley’s secret\r\nlay in the floors being double, and there being interposed between the\r\ntwo boards sheets of laminated iron and copper, not thicker than stout\r\npaper, which rendered the floor air-tight and thereby intercepted the\r\nascent of the heated air; so that, although the inferior boards were\r\nactually charred, the metal prevented the combustion taking place in the\r\nupper flooring. Six experiments were made by Mr. Hartley in this house\r\nin 1776, but we cannot ascertain any particulars about them, or any\r\nadvantages which accrued to the public from the invention, although the\r\nCourt of Common Council awarded him the freedom of the City of London for\r\nhis successful experiments.\r\n\r\nIn 1805 Mr. Maconochie proposed to saturate with resinous and oily\r\nmatters inferior woods, and thus render them more lasting. This proposal\r\nwas practically carried out in 1811 by Mr. Lukin, who constructed a\r\npeculiar stove for the purpose of thus impregnating wood under the\r\ninfluence of an increased temperature. The scheme, however, had but\r\nvery partial success, for either the heat was too low and the wood was\r\nnot thoroughly aired and seasoned, or it was too high and the wood was\r\nmore or less scorched and burnt. Mr. Lukin buried wood in _pulverized\r\ncharcoal_ in a heated oven, but the fibres were afterwards discovered to\r\nhave started from each other. He next erected a large kiln in Woolwich\r\ndockyard, capable of containing 250 loads of timber, but an explosion\r\ntook place on the first trial, before the process was complete, which\r\nproved fatal to six of the workmen, and wounded fourteen, two of\r\nwhom shortly afterwards died. The explosion was like the shock of an\r\nearthquake. It demolished the wall of the dockyard, part of which was\r\nthrown to the distance of 250 feet; an iron door weighing 280 lb. was\r\ndriven to the distance of 230 feet; and other parts of the building were\r\nborne in the air upwards of 300 feet. The experiment was not repeated.\r\n\r\nMr. Lukin was not so fortunate in 1811 as in 1808, for in the latter\r\nyear he received a considerable reward from the Government for what was\r\nconsidered a successful principle of ventilating hospital ships.\r\n\r\nIn 1815 Mr. Wade recommended the impregnation of timber with resinous or\r\noleaginous matter (preferring linseed oil to whale oil) or with _common\r\nresin_ dissolved in a lixivium of _caustic alkali_, and that the timber\r\nshould afterwards be plunged into water acidulated with any cheap acid,\r\nor with alum in solution. He considered that timber impregnated with oil\r\nwould not be disagreeable to rats, worms, cockroaches, &c., and that the\r\ncontrary was the case with resin. He also recommended the impregnation of\r\ntimber with sulphate of _copper, zinc, or iron_, rejecting deliquescent\r\nsalts, as they corrode metals.\r\n\r\nIn 1815 Mr. Ambrose Boydon, of the Navy Office, strongly recommended\r\nthat the timber, planks, and treenails of ships should be first boiled\r\nin _limewater_ to correct the acid, and that they afterwards should be\r\nboiled in a _thin solution of glue_, by which means the pores of the wood\r\nwould be filled with a hard substance insoluble by water, which would not\r\nonly give the timbers durability, by preventing vegetation, but increase\r\ntheir strength. Glue, he thought, might be used without limewater, or\r\nglue and limewater mixed together.\r\n\r\nIn 1817 Mr. William Chapman published the result of various experiments\r\nhe had made on wood with _lime_, _soap_, and _alkaline_ and _mineral\r\nsalts_. He recommended a solution of a pound of _sulphate of copper_ or\r\nblue vitriol (at that time 7_d._ per pound) dissolved in four ale gallons\r\nof rain water, and mopped on hot over all the infected parts, or thrown\r\nover them in a plentiful libation. He also recommended one ounce of\r\n_corrosive sublimate_ (then 6_s._ per pound) to a gallon of rainwater\r\napplied in the same manner to the infected parts. For weather-boarded\r\nbuildings he considered one or more coats of thin _coal tar_, combined\r\nwith a small portion of _palm oil_, for the purpose of preventing their\r\ntendency to rend, to be a good preservative.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Wade, Boydon, and Chapman published works on dry rot about this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn 1822 Mr. Oxford took out a patent for an improved method of preventing\r\n“decay of timber,” &c. The process proposed was as follows: “The\r\nessential _oil of tar_ was first extracted by distillation, and at the\r\nsame time saturated with _chlorine gas_. Proportions of _oxide of lead_,\r\n_carbonate of lime_, and _carbon of purified coal tar_ well ground,\r\nwere mixed with the oil, and the composition was then applied in thick\r\ncoatings to the substances intended to be preserved.”\r\n\r\nOn 31st March, 1832, Mr. Kyan patented his process of _corrosive\r\nsublimate_ (solution of the _bi-chloride of mercury_) for preventing dry\r\nrot; which process consisted as follows: A solution of the corrosive\r\nsublimate is first made, and the timber is placed in the tank. The wood\r\nis held down in such a way, that when immersed on the fluid being pumped\r\nin, it cannot rise, but is kept under the surface, there being beams\r\nto retain it in its place. There it is left for a week, after which\r\nthe liquor is pumped off, and the wood is removed. This being done,\r\nthe timber is dried, and said to be prepared. Sir Robert Smirke was\r\none of the first to use timber prepared by Kyan, in some buildings in\r\nthe Temple, London; and he made some experiments on timber which had\r\nundergone Kyan’s process. He says, “I took a certain number of pieces\r\nof wood cut from the same log of yellow pine, from poplar, and from the\r\ncommon Scotch fir; these pieces I placed first in a cesspool, into which\r\nthe waters of the common sewers discharged themselves; they remained\r\nthere six months; they were then removed from thence, and placed in a\r\nhotbed of compost under a garden-frame; they remained there a second six\r\nmonths; they were afterwards put into a flower border, placed half out of\r\nthe ground, and I gave my gardener directions to water them whenever he\r\nwatered the flowers; they remained there a similar period of six months.\r\nI put them afterwards into a cellar where there was some dampness, and\r\nthe air completely excluded; they remained there a fourth period of six\r\nmonths, and were afterwards put into a very wet cellar. Those pieces of\r\nwood which underwent Kyan’s process are in the same state as when I first\r\nhad them, and all the others to which the process had not been applied\r\nare more or less rotten, and the poplar is wholly destroyed.\r\n\r\n“I applied Kyan’s process to yellow Canadian pine about three years ago,\r\nand exposed that wood to the severest tests I could apply, and it remains\r\nuninjured, when any other timber (oak or Baltic wood) would certainly\r\nhave decayed if exposed to the same trial, and not prepared in that\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n“As another example of the effect of the process, I may mention that\r\nabout two years ago, in a basement story of some chambers in the Temple,\r\nLondon, the wood flooring and the wood lining of the walls were entirely\r\ndecayed from the dampness of the ground and walls, and to repair it under\r\nsuch circumstances was useless. As I found it extremely difficult to\r\nprevent the dampness, I recommended lining the walls and the floor with\r\nthis prepared wood, which was done; and about six weeks ago I took down\r\npart of it to examine whether any of the wood was injured, but it was\r\nfound in as good a state as when first put up. I did not find the nails\r\nmore liable to rust.’\r\n\r\n“I have used Kyan’s process in a very considerable quantity of paling\r\nnearly three years ago; that paling is now in quite as good a state as it\r\nwas, though it is partly in the ground. It is yellow pine. Some that I\r\nput up the year before, without using Kyan’s process (yellow pine), not\r\nfixed in the ground, but close upon it, is decayed.”\r\n\r\nThis evidence, by such an experienced architect as the late Sir Robert\r\nSmirke was, is certainly of great value in favour of Kyan’s process.\r\n\r\nThe recorded evidence upon the efficiency of this mode of treating timber\r\nfor its preservation is somewhat contradictory. On the Great Western\r\nRailway 40,000 loads were prepared, at an expenditure of 1¾ lb. of\r\nsublimate to each load, the timber, 7 inch, being immersed for a period\r\nof eight days, and the uniformity of the strength of the solution being\r\nconstantly maintained by pumping. Some samples of this timber, after six\r\nyears’ use as sleepers on the railway, were found “as sound as on the day\r\non which they were first put down.” This timber was prepared by simple\r\nimmersion only, without exhaustion or pressure. Some of the sleepers\r\non the London and Birmingham Railway, on the other hand, which had been\r\nKyanized three years only, were found absolutely rotten, and Kyan’s\r\nprocess was there consequently abandoned.\r\n\r\nThis process is said to cost an additional expense to the owner of from\r\nfifteen to twenty shillings per load of timber. Mr. Kyan at first used\r\n1 lb. of the salt in 4 gallons of water, but it was found that the wood\r\nabsorbed 4 or 5 lb. of this salt per load; more water was added to lessen\r\nthe expense, until the solution became so weak as in a great measure to\r\nlose its effect.\r\n\r\nSimple immersion being found imperfect as a means of injecting the\r\nsublimate, attempts were afterwards made to improve the efficiency of the\r\nsolution by _forcing_ it into the wood. Closed tanks were substituted\r\nfor the open ones, and forcing pumps, &c., were added to the apparatus.\r\nThe pressure applied equalled 100 lb. on the square inch. With this\r\narrangement a solution was made use of having 1 lb. of the sublimate to\r\n2 gallons of water; and it was found that three-fourths of this quantity\r\nsufficed for preparing one load of timber. The timber was afterwards\r\ntested, and it was ascertained that the solution had penetrated to the\r\nheart of the logs. Mr. Thompson, the Secretary to Kyan’s Company, stated,\r\nin March, 1842, that experience had proved “that the strength of the\r\nmixture should not be less than 1 lb. of sublimate to 15 gallons of\r\nwater; and he had never found any well-authenticated instance of timber\r\ndecaying when it had been properly prepared at that strength.” As much\r\nas 1 in 9 was not unfrequently used. Kyan’s process is now but very\r\nrarely used; Messrs. Bethell, of King William Street, London, adopt it\r\nwhen requested by their customers. We have given the statements which\r\nhave been made for and against this patent, but after a lapse of forty\r\nyears it is difficult to reconcile conflicting statements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PATENT PRESERVATIVE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nHorizontal Section of Mr. Kyan’s Original Tank and Cistern.\r\n\r\nA. _Bottom of Tank._\r\n\r\nB. _¾″ Iron bolts to connect the planks which form the sides and end of\r\nthe Tank and Cistern._\r\n\r\nC. _The Cistern which contains the solution._\r\n\r\nD. _The Tank._\r\n\r\nE. _Pump for raising the solution from tank into Cistern._\r\n\r\nF. _Tap for conveying the solution from Cistern to Tank._\r\n\r\nG. _Wood sleepers to carry Tank and Cistern._]\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Kyan invented his process in 1832, Sir Humphrey Davy had\r\npreviously used and recommended to the Admiralty, and Navy Board, a\r\nweak solution of the same thing to be used as a wash where rot made\r\nits appearance: on giving his opinion upon Mr. Lukin’s process, that\r\neminent chemist observed, “that he had found corrosive sublimate highly\r\nantiseptic, and preservative of animal and vegetable substances, and\r\ntherefore recommended rubbing the surface of timber with a solution\r\nof it.” In 1821 Mr. Knowles, of the Navy Office, referred to the use\r\nof corrosive sublimate for timber. In fact, it was used in 1705, in\r\nProvence (France), for preserving wood from beetles. Kyan, however, was\r\nthe first to apply it to any extent. In the years 1833 to 1836, at the\r\nArsenal, Woolwich, experiments were instituted, having for their object\r\nthe establishing, or otherwise, the claims of Kyan’s system; the results\r\nof which were of a satisfactory nature. Dr. Faraday has stated that the\r\ncombination of the materials used was not simply mechanical but chemical;\r\nand Captain Alderson, C.E., having experimented upon some specimens\r\nof ash and Christiana deal, found that the rigidity of the timber was\r\nenhanced, but its strength was in some measure impaired; its specific\r\ngravity being also in some degree diminished.[8] Kyan’s process is said\r\nby some to render the wood brittle.\r\n\r\nMr. Kyan considered that the commencement of rot might be stopped or\r\nprevented by the application of corrosive sublimate, in consequence\r\nof the chemical combination which takes place between the corrosive\r\nsublimate and those albuminous particles which Berzelius and others of\r\nthe highest authority consider to exist in and form the essence of wood;\r\nwhich, being the first parts to run to decay, cause others to decay with\r\nthem. By seasoning timber in the ordinary way, the destructive principle\r\nis dried, and under common circumstances rendered inert. But when the\r\ntimber is afterwards exposed to great moisture, &c. (the fermentative\r\nprinciple being soluble when merely dried), it will sometimes be again\r\ncalled into action. Kyan’s process is said not only altogether to destroy\r\nthis principle and render it inert, but, by making it solid and perfectly\r\ninsoluble, to remove it from the action of moisture altogether. It thus\r\nloses its hygrometric properties, and, therefore, prepared or patent\r\nseasoned timber is not liable to those changes of atmosphere which affect\r\nthat which is seasoned in the common way. All woods, including mahogany\r\nand the finest and most expensive wood, may be seasoned by Kyan’s process\r\nin a very short space of time, instead of the months required by the\r\nordinary methods.\r\n\r\nThe reader will find a great deal about Kyan’s system in the ‘Quarterly\r\nReview,’ April, 1833; and about proposals for using chloride of mercury\r\nfor wood, ‘Memoirs of the Academy of Dijon,’ 1767; ‘Bull. des Sciences\r\nteen.,’ v. ii., 1824, Paris; and ‘Bull. de Pharm.,’ v. 6, 1814, Paris.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Canadian timber is much more liable to decay than\r\nthat grown in the northern parts of Europe, and for this reason is never\r\nextensively used in buildings of a superior description. The principle\r\nof decay being destroyed by Kyan’s process as above described, this\r\nobjection no longer exists, and this kind of timber may therefore now be\r\nemployed with as great security as that of a superior quality and higher\r\nprice. The same observation applies with great force to timber of British\r\ngrowth, particularly to that of Scotland, much of which is considered as\r\nof little or no value for durable purposes, on account of its extreme\r\nliability to decay, whether in exposed situations or otherwise. The\r\nprocess invented by Kyan might therefore render of considerable value\r\nplantations of larch, firs of all kinds, birch, elm, beech, ash, poplar,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nCost of process in 1832, 1_l._ per load of 50 cubic feet of timber.\r\n\r\nMr. W. Inwood, the architect of St. Pancras Church, London, reported\r\nfavourably of Kyan’s process. On 22nd February, 1833, Professor Faraday\r\ndelivered a lecture at the Royal Institution, London, on Kyanizing\r\ntimber; and on 17th April, 1837, he reported that Kyan’s process had not\r\ncaused any rusting or oxidation of the iron in the ship ‘Samuel Enderby,’\r\nafter the ship had been subjected to this process, and had been on a\r\nthree years’ voyage to the South Sea fisheries; and in the same year,\r\nviz. 1837, Dr. Dickson delivered a lecture at the Royal Institute of\r\nBritish Architects on dry rot, recommending Kyan’s process.\r\n\r\nFive years after Mr. Kyan’s invention, viz. in 1837, a Mr. Flocton\r\ninvented a process for preventing decay, by saturating timber with\r\n_wood-tar_ and _acetate of iron_, but little is known of this invention:\r\nwe believe it was a failure.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year Mr. Flocton’s process was made known, a Frenchman\r\nnamed Letellier recommended saturating timber in a solution of _corrosive\r\nsublimate_, and when dry, into one of _glue_, _size_, &c.[9]\r\n\r\nDuring this year Mr. Margary took out his patent for applying _sulphate\r\nof copper_ to wood. We propose to describe Margary’s process further on:\r\nwe do not think he received any medals for it.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at the modern _creosoting_ process, which was brought\r\nto perfection by the late Mr. John Bethell. Mr. Bethell’s process of\r\ncreosoting, or the injection of the heavy oil of tar, was first patented\r\nby him on July 11th, 1838.[10] It consists in impregnating the wood\r\nthroughout with oil of tar, and other bituminous matters containing\r\ncreosote, and also with pyrolignite of iron, which holds more creosote in\r\nsolution than any other watery menstruum. Creosote, now so extensively\r\nused in preserving wood, is obtained from coal tar, which, when submitted\r\nto distillation, is found to consist of pitch, essential oil (creosote),\r\nnaphtha, ammonia, &c. In the application of the oil of tar for this\r\npurpose, it is now considered to be indispensable that the ammonia be\r\ngot rid of; otherwise the wood sometimes becomes brown and decays, as\r\nmay be constantly seen in wood coated with the common oil tar. The kind\r\nof creosote preferred by continental engineers and chemists, and also by\r\nthe late Mr. John Bethell himself, is _thick_, and rich in _naphthaline_.\r\nSome English chemists now seem to prefer the thinnest oil, which contains\r\nno naphthaline, but a little more carbolic acid; the crude carbolic acid\r\nwould vary from 5 to 15 per cent.: no engineer has ever required more\r\nthan 5 per cent. of crude carbolic acid in creosote. The thinner oil\r\nappears to be more likely to be drawn out of the wood by the heat of the\r\nsun or absorption in powdery soil, and is more readily dissolved out by\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nMummies many thousands of years old have evidently been preserved on\r\nthe creosoting principle, and from observing the mummies the process\r\nof creosoting suggested itself to Mr. Bethell. The ancient Egyptians,\r\nwhether from the peculiarity of their religious opinions, or from the\r\ndesire to shun destruction and gain perpetuity even for their dead\r\nbodies, prepared the corpses of their deceased friends in a particular\r\nway, viz. by coagulating the albumen of the various fluids of the body\r\nby means of creosote, cedar oil, salt, and other substances, and also\r\nby excluding the air. How perfectly this method has preserved them the\r\noccasional opening of a mummy permits us to see. A good account of the\r\noperation is given in the chapter on mummies, in the second volume of\r\nEgyptian Antiquities in the ‘Library of Entertaining Knowledge.’\r\n\r\nBy the process of creosoting the timber is rendered more durable, and\r\nless liable to the attack of worms; but it becomes very inflammable;\r\nthat is, _when_ once alight burns quickly; in addition to which, the\r\ndisagreeable odour from timber so treated renders it objectionable for\r\nbeing used in the building of dwelling-houses.\r\n\r\nThe action of the solutions in water of metallic salts is, if the mixture\r\nis sufficiently strong, to coagulate the albumen in the sap; but the\r\nfibre is left unprotected.\r\n\r\nCreosote has the same effect of coagulating the albumen, whilst it fills\r\nthe pores of the wood with a bituminous asphaltic substance, which gives\r\na waterproof covering to the fibre, prevents the absorption of water, and\r\nis obnoxious to animal life.\r\n\r\nIn cases where the complete preservation of timber is of vital\r\nimportance, and expense not a consideration, the wood should be first\r\nsubjected to Burnett’s process, and then creosoted; by which means it\r\nwould be nearly indestructible; the reason for this combined process\r\nbeing, that the albumen or sap absorbs the creosote more readily than the\r\nheart of the timber, which can, however, be penetrated by the solution of\r\nchloride of zinc. Mr. John Bethell’s patent of 1853 recommends this in a\r\nrather improved form. He says the timber should _first_ be injected with\r\nmetallic salts, then dried in a drying-house, then creosoted. By this\r\nmethod, very considerable quantities both of metallic salt and creosote\r\ncan be injected into timber.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the elasticity of wood is increased by\r\ncreosoting; the heart-wood only decays by oxidation.\r\n\r\nThe wood should be dried previous to undergoing the process, as the\r\nsapwood, otherwise almost useless, can be rendered serviceable, and for\r\npiles for marine work whole round timber should be used, because the\r\nsapwood is so much more readily saturated with the oil, and this prevents\r\nthe worms from making an inroad into the heart.\r\n\r\nMr. Bethell uses about 10 lb. of creosote per cubic foot of wood, and\r\nhe does not allow a piece of timber to be sent from his works without\r\nbeing tested to ascertain if it has absorbed that amount, or an amount\r\npreviously agreed upon. We mention the latter statement, because it is\r\nevident that all descriptions of wood cannot be made to imbibe the same\r\namount. This process is chiefly used for pine timber: yellow pine should\r\nabsorb about 11 lb. to the cubic foot, and Riga pine about 9 lb. The\r\nquantity of oil recommended by the patentee, engineers, and others, is\r\nfrom 8 to 10 lb. for land purposes, and about 12 lb. to the cubic foot\r\nfor marine. In this country, for marine the quantity does not exceed\r\n12 lb.; but on the Continent, in France, Belgium, and Holland, the\r\nquantity used is from 14 to 22 lb. (!) per cubic foot. The specifications\r\nfrequently issued by engineers for sleepers for foreign railways describe\r\nthem to be entirely of heart-wood, and then to be creosoted to the extent\r\nof 10 lb. of the oil per cubic foot: this it is impossible to do, the\r\nvalue of the process being in the retention of the sapwood.\r\n\r\nIt being ascertained a few years since that the centres of some sleepers\r\nwere not impregnated with the fluid, after the sleeper had been creosoted\r\nto the extent of 10 lb. of creosote per cubic foot, Sir Macdonald\r\nStephenson suggested, as a means of obviating that defect, the boring\r\nof two holes, 1 inch in diameter, through each sleeper longitudinally,\r\nand impregnating up to 12 lb. or 14 lb. per cubic foot. By that means\r\nthe creosote would be sent all through the sleeper. The boring by hand\r\nwould be an expensive process, but by machinery it might be effected at a\r\ncomparatively small increased cost.\r\n\r\nDuring the last twenty-five years an enormous quantity of creosoted\r\nrailway sleepers have been sent to India and other hot climates. The\r\nnative woods are generally too hard for penetration. On the great Indian\r\nPeninsula Railway the native woods were so hard and close-grained that\r\nthey could not be impregnated with any preservative substance, sál wood\r\nbeing principally used, into which creosote would not penetrate more\r\nthan one quarter of an inch. As regards creosoting wood in India, it\r\nis moreover a costly process, owing to the difficulty and expense of\r\nconveying creosote from England; iron tanks are necessary to hold the oil\r\nwhen on board ship, and, being unsaleable in India, add to the expense.\r\n\r\nEnglish contractors often send piles to be creosoted which have been\r\ntaken from the timber docks. The large quantity of water they contain\r\nresists the entrance of the oil, and the result is that a great deal of\r\ntimber is badly prepared because the contractors cannot obtain it dry.\r\n\r\nIn the best creosoting works the tank or cylinder is about 6 feet\r\ndiameter, and from 20 to 50 feet long. In some instances cylinders are\r\nopen at both ends, and closed with iron doors, so that sleepers or timber\r\nentered at one end on being treated can be delivered finished at the\r\nopposite end; but for all practical purposes one open end is sufficient,\r\nas the oil when heated being of such a searching character it is a\r\ndifficult matter to get the doors perfectly air-tight, consequently they\r\nare apt to leak during the time the pressure is being applied. Pipes are\r\nled from the cylinder to the air and force pumps; the air is not only\r\nextracted from the interior of the cylinder, but also from the pores of\r\nthe timber. When a vacuum is made, the oil, which is contained in a tank\r\nbelow the cylinder, is allowed to rush in, and, as soon as the cylinder\r\nis full, the inlet pipe is shut and the pressure pumps started to force\r\nthe oil into the wood; the pressure maintained is from 150 to 200 lb.\r\nto the square inch, until the wood has absorbed the required quantity\r\nof oil, which is learned by an index gauge fixed to the working tank\r\nbelow. All cylinders are fitted with safety valves, which allow the oil\r\nnot immediately absorbed to pass again into the tank. The oil is heated\r\nby coils of pipe placed in the tank, through which a current of steam is\r\npassed from end to end, raising the temperature to 120°.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the cost of creosoting: half-round sleepers, being 9\r\nfeet long, 10 inches wide, and 5 inches thick, properly creosoted, are\r\nworth about 4_s._ each; adzing for the chairs (done by machine) costs\r\n6_s._ per 100. These prices, unfortunately, vary very much, according to\r\ncircumstances. The fir sleepers on the London and Birmingham Railway\r\ncost 7_s._ 6_d._ each, and the patent preservative added 9_d._ more to\r\nthe expense, but they did not cost so much on other lines. A London\r\nbuilder wrote to us in 1870, as follows: “Our price for creosoting\r\ntimber, &c., is 15_s._ per load of 50 cubic feet. Price of creosote,\r\n2_d._ per gallon.”\r\n\r\nBy returns from the Leith Harbour Works it was shown that the average\r\nquantity of creosote absorbed by the timber was 57⅞ gallons per load, or\r\n577 lb. weight forced into 50 cubic feet of wood. Assuming the cost to be\r\n15_s._ per load, and the creosote at 2_d._ per gallon, the creosote would\r\ncost 9_s._ 8_d._, and the labour and profit 5_s._ 4_d._ per load of 50\r\ncubic feet.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to observe that all methods of protecting timber depend\r\nfor their success upon the skilful and conscientious manner in which they\r\nare applied; for, as they involve chemical actions on a large scale,\r\ntheir efficiency must depend upon the observance of the minute practical\r\nprecautions required to exclude any disturbing causes. In the case of\r\ncreosoting: to distil the creosote, to draw the sap or other moisture\r\nfrom the wood, and subsequently to inject the creosote in a proper\r\nmanner, it is necessary that the operations should be carried into effect\r\nunder the supervision of experienced persons of high character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PATENT PRESERVATIVE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nMessrs. John Bethell and Cos. Timber preserving apparatus.]\r\n\r\nMr. Bethell’s process has been and still is being tested on the Indian\r\nrailways. According to Dr. Cleghorn, it appears that many of the\r\ncreosoted sleepers have, however, “been found decayed in the centre,\r\nthe interior portion being scooped out, leaving nothing but a deceptive\r\nshell, in some instances not more than ½ inch in thickness,” but he\r\ndoes not state whether the sleepers were prepared in England or in\r\nIndia; because, if prepared in India, it is probable that some of the\r\nhard Indian woods, into which it is not possible to get creosote or\r\nany other preservative fluid, had been used. Mr. Burt, who has large\r\ntimber-preserving works in London for creosoting, stated about eight\r\nyears since, that after an experience of twenty years, during which\r\ntime he had sent over one million and a half sleepers to India alone,\r\nbesides having prepared many thousand loads of timber for other purposes,\r\nhe could safely assert that the instances of failure had been rare and\r\nisolated.\r\n\r\nA section of a piece of timber impregnated with creosote presents some\r\ncurious and very distinctive characteristics, according to the duration\r\nof the process of injection and amount of tar injected. In every case\r\nthe injected tar follows the lines and sinuosities of the longitudinal\r\nfibres. When injected in sufficient quantity it fills the pores\r\naltogether; when, on the contrary, the process has been incompletely\r\nperformed, which, however, is generally sufficient, the tar accumulates\r\nin the transverse sections, and plugs the channels that give access to\r\ndeleterious agents.\r\n\r\nThe experiments made by M. Melseuns on oaken blocks exposed to the fumes\r\nof _liquid ammonia_ show that the conservating fluids follow the precise\r\ncourse that would be taken by decay. In wood treated with creosote the\r\ntar acts on the very parts first exposed to injury, and on the course\r\nthat would be taken by decay, which is thus rendered impossible. The\r\nmethods of injection suggested by M. Melseuns in 1845 did not answer\r\nequally well with every kind of wood. After trying wooden blocks in\r\nevery sort of condition, dressed and in the rough, green and dry, sound\r\nand decayed, M. Melseuns found that alder, birch, beech, hornbeam, and\r\nwillow were easily and completely impregnated; deal sometimes resisted\r\nthe process, the innermost layers remaining white; poplar and oak offered\r\na very great resistance--indeed, with poplar it was found necessary to\r\nrepeat the process.\r\n\r\nThe decay of sleepers, prepared and unprepared, will often depend on\r\ntheir form. Three forms have been used: 1st, the half-round sleeper,\r\n10 inches by 5 inches; these are now almost universally used; 2nd, the\r\ntriangular sleeper, about 12 inches wide on each side, used by Mr. Cubitt\r\non the Dover line, but since abandoned; and 3rd, the half square, 14\r\ninches by 7 inches, used by Mr. Brunel and still in use. Mr. G. O. Maun,\r\nin reporting on the state of the sleepers of the Pernambuco Railway,\r\nstates that fair average samples taken out on the 1st December, 1863\r\n(laid in 1857), show that the half-round intermediate sleeper is in the\r\nmost perfect state of preservation; in fact, nearly as good as on the day\r\nit was put down; while the square-sawn or joint sleeper has not withstood\r\nthe effects of the climate so well.\r\n\r\nThe kind of ballast in which it will be most advisable to lay the sleeper\r\nis another important point to be attended to. About 12 miles of the\r\nPernambuco Railway are entirely laid with creosoted sleepers, principally\r\nin white sand. In this description of ballast the half-round sleepers\r\nhave suffered, since the opening of the first section of the line in 1858\r\nup to 1866, a depreciation of not more than 1 per cent., whilst the\r\nsquare-sawn sleepers have experienced a depreciation of not less than\r\n50 per cent. Had the latter been placed in wet cuttings with ballast\r\nretentive of moisture, no doubt the whole of them would have required to\r\nbe renewed. Hence it is evident that fine open sand ballast, which allows\r\na free drainage during the rains, is best adapted for the preservation of\r\nsleepers in the tropics: it has also been found to be the best in most\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe number of testimonials given in favour of creosote is very large,\r\nand are from the most eminent engineers of all countries, in addition\r\nto which Mr. Bethell has received several medals at international\r\nexhibitions. The English engineers include Messrs. Brunel, Gregory,\r\nAbernethy, Ure, Hemans, Hawkshaw, and Cudworth; the French, MM. Molinos\r\nand Forestier; the Dutch, Messrs. Waldorp, Freem, and Von Baumhauer; and\r\nthe Belgian, M. Crepin. The late Mr. Brunel expressly stated that, in his\r\nopinion, well creosoted timbers would be found in a sound and serviceable\r\ncondition at the expiration of forty years. M. Forestier, French engineer\r\nof La Vendée department, reporting to the juries of the French Exhibition\r\nof 1867, cites a number of experiments he has lately tried upon many\r\npieces of creosoted and uncreosoted oak, elm, ash, Swedish, Norwegian,\r\nand Dantzic red fir, Norway white fir, plane, and poplar, and shows that\r\nin each case, except that of the poplar, the resistance of the wood both\r\nto bending and crushing weight was much increased by creosoting.\r\n\r\nDrs. Brande, Ure, and Letheby, also bear testimony to the efficacy of\r\nthis mode of preserving timber.\r\n\r\nCreosoting has been extensively employed upon all the principal railways\r\nin Great Britain. In England, upon the London and North Western,\r\nNorth Eastern, South Eastern, Great Western, &c. In Scotland, on the\r\nCaledonian, Great Northern, &c. In Ireland, on the Great Southern and\r\nWestern, Midland, &c. It has also been and is being employed in Belgium,\r\nHolland, France, Prussia, India, and America.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1838 and 1840, Sir William Burnett’s (formerly\r\nDirector-General of the Medical Department of the Navy) process was first\r\nmade known to the public.\r\n\r\nThis process consists of an injection of _chloride of zinc_ into timber,\r\nin the proportion of about 1 lb. of the salt to about 9 or 10 gallons of\r\nwater, forced into the wood under a pressure of 150 lb. per square inch.\r\n\r\nThe late Professor Graham thus wrote of its efficiency: “After making\r\nseveral experiments on wood prepared by the solution of chloride of zinc\r\nfor the purpose of preservation, and having given the subject my best\r\nconsideration, I have come to the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n“The wood appears to be fully and deeply penetrated by the metallic salt.\r\nI have found it in the centre of a large prepared block.\r\n\r\n“The salt, although very soluble, does not leave the wood easily when\r\nexposed to the weather, or buried in dry or damp earth. It does not\r\ncome to the surface of the wood like the crystallizable salts. I have\r\nno doubt, indeed, that the greater part of the salts will remain in the\r\nwood for years, when employed for railway sleepers or such purposes. This\r\nmay be of material consequence when the wood is exposed to the attacks\r\nof insects, such as the white ant in India, which, I believe, would be\r\nrepelled by the poisonous metallic salt. After being long macerated in\r\ncold water, or even boiled in water, thin chips of the prepared wood\r\nretain a sensible quantity of the oxide of zinc; which I confirmed by Mr.\r\nToplis’ test, and observed that the wood can be permanently dyed from\r\nbeing charged with a metallic mordant.\r\n\r\n“I have no doubt, from repeated observations made during several years,\r\nof the valuable preservative qualities of the solution of chloride\r\nof zinc, as applied in Sir W. Burnett’s process; and would refer its\r\nbeneficial action chiefly to the small quantity of the metallic salt,\r\nwhich is permanently retained by the ligneous fibre in all circumstances\r\nof exposure. The oxide of zinc appears to alter and harden the fibre\r\nof the wood, and destroy the solubility, and prevent the tendency to\r\ndecomposition of the azotised principles it contains by entering into\r\nchemical combination with them.”\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Jury, which was drawn up by the Count of Westphalia, at\r\nthe Cologne International Agricultural Exhibition, in 1865, upon prepared\r\nspecimens of timber, has the following remarks on the chloride of zinc\r\nprocess:\r\n\r\n    1st. That chloride of zinc is the only substance which thoroughly\r\n    penetrates the timber, and is at the same time the best adapted\r\n    for its preservation.\r\n\r\n    2nd. That the process of impregnating the wood after cutting is\r\n    more useful and rational than doing so while the tree is growing.\r\n\r\n    3rd. That red beech is the only wood which has been impregnated\r\n    in an uniform and thorough manner.\r\n\r\nIt should, however, be stated that the Jury had very slender evidence\r\npresented to it respecting the creosoting process. The creosoted\r\nspecimens had been impregnated under the pressure of 60 lb. to 65 lb. per\r\nsquare inch for three or four hours, and were consequently inefficiently\r\ndone; in England the pressure per square inch would have been at least\r\n140 lb.\r\n\r\nDrs. Brande and Cooper, of England, and Dr. Cleghorn, of India, also\r\nwrote favourably of Sir W. Burnett’s process.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 a powerful cylinder, of Burnett’s construction, hermetically\r\nclosed, was laid down adjoining the sawmills in Woolwich dockyard. It\r\nwas found to admit the largest description of timber for the purpose of\r\nhaving the moisture extracted, and the pores filled with chloride of\r\nzinc. Three specimens of wood--English oak, English elm, and Dantzic\r\nfir--remained uninjured in the fungus pit at Woolwich for five years;\r\nwhile similar, but unprepared, specimens were all found more or less\r\ndecayed.\r\n\r\nThe cost of preparing timber by this process is 12_s._ per load, besides\r\n2_s._ for landing and loading: 1 lb. of the material costing 1_s._, which\r\nis sufficient for 9 or 10 gallons of water.\r\n\r\nSir W. Burnett and Co.’s works for hydraulic apparatus and tanks are at\r\nNelson Wharf, Millwall, Poplar; their office is at 90, Cannon Street,\r\nLondon. Their terms are--\r\n\r\n    “For timber, round or square, including planks, deals, hop-poles,\r\n    paving-blocks, &c., against rot, 12_s._ per load of 50 cubic feet.\r\n\r\n    “For park palings, cabinet work, wine and other laths, as per\r\n    agreement.\r\n\r\n    “For railway sleepers, 9 feet long, 10 inches by 5 inches,\r\n    landing and reshipping included, 7_d._ each.\r\n\r\n    “For timber to be rendered uninflammable, 25_s._ per load.”\r\n\r\nSir W. Burnett’s firm now sell their patent concentrated solution at\r\n5_s._ per gallon: each gallon must be diluted with 40 gallons of water,\r\naccording to the instructions in the licence, for which no charge is made.\r\n\r\nThe reader will probably have observed that this process is _considered_\r\nto render timber uninflammable; then let us see what will be the cost of\r\nobtaining a fire-proof house.\r\n\r\nThe principal building material which causes the destruction of our\r\nhouses by fire is wood--_combustible wood_. If, therefore, (as nearly\r\nall our houses are “brick and timber” erections,) we render this wood\r\nuninflammable, what will the cost be?\r\n\r\nThe following is an _approximate_ estimate of the extra expense,\r\nincluding sundries, &c.:--\r\n\r\n    Timber and Deals.  Cost of House.  Additional expense.\r\n        Loads.               £                  £\r\n\r\n         25                1000                34\r\n\r\n         15                 600                21\r\n\r\n         10                 400                14\r\n\r\n          8                 250                12\r\n\r\nWhen will the Building Act compel us to use this table _in daily\r\npractice?_\r\n\r\nAlthough among the many attempts to preserve wood those in England have\r\nproved the most successful, it should be mentioned that France, Germany,\r\nand America have given much attention to the subject.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the last century Du Hamel and Buffon pointed out the\r\npossibility of preserving wood, as well as the means of rendering it\r\nunalterable. As early as 1758 Du Hamel made experiments on the vital\r\nsuction of plants, and made some curious observations on the different\r\nrings of vegetable matter which absorb most liquid in different plants.\r\nHe also tried the effect of vital suction and pressure (of gravitation)\r\nacting at the same time. His process was reviewed by Barral in 1842.\r\n\r\nAbout 1784 M. Migneron invented a process about which little is now\r\nknown, but the wood was covered with certain fatty substances. Wood nine\r\nyears exposed to deterioration was improved by this process. M. Migneron\r\nhad the approval of Buffon, Franklin, and the Academies. His invention\r\nwas again brought into notice in 1807, when it was found that timber\r\nwhich had been prepared by it in 1784, and exposed more than twenty\r\nyears, was quite sound.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 Cadet de Gassicourt made different kinds of wood imbibe vegetable\r\nand mineral substances, and certain unguents: he used metallic salts\r\n(iron, tin, &c.).\r\n\r\nIn 1813 M. Champy plunged wood into a bath of _tallow_ at 334°, and kept\r\nit there two or three hours. His experiments were afterwards repeated by\r\nMr. Payne.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1832 it was proposed in America to apply _pyroligneous\r\nacid_ to the surface of wood, or introduce it by fumigation.\r\n\r\nBiot (who has written an excellent life of Sir Isaac Newton) remarked,\r\nin 1831, that wood could be soaked by pressure; but his process of\r\npenetrating it with liquids was imperfect, and his discovery remains\r\nunapplied.\r\n\r\nA Frenchman, of the name of Bréant, made about this time a discovery\r\nwhich preceded Boucherie’s method, which is adopted to a great extent\r\nin France. Bréant’s apparatus consisted of a very ingenious machine,\r\nwhich, acting by pressure, caused liquids to penetrate to all points\r\nof a mass of wood of great diameter and considerable length. He may\r\ntherefore be regarded as having solved the problem of penetration in\r\na scientific, though not in a practically applied, point of view. Dr.\r\nBoucherie testified before the Académie des Sciences, in 1840, to\r\nthe merit of Bréant’s invention, which, with modifications by Payne,\r\nBrochard, and Gemini, has been worked in France and England. This process\r\nwas recommended by Payne in 1840 and 1844, and imitated by him in France,\r\nand later on by Yengat and Bauner, who used both _an air pump and a\r\nforcing pump_. Bréant obtained three patents, viz. 1st, in 1831, to act\r\nby pressure; 2nd, in 1837, by vital suction: and 3rd, in 1838, vacuum by\r\nsteam. A mixture of linseed oil and resin succeeded best with him. He\r\nattached more importance to the thorough penetration of the wood than to\r\nthe choice of the penetrating substances. He borrowed his process from\r\nDu Hamel, but to make the necessary suction in the pores he produces a\r\npartial vacuum in the impregnating cylinder by filling it with steam, and\r\ncondensing the steam.\r\n\r\nPrevious to Boucherie’s method, a German, Frantz Moll, in 1835, proposed\r\nto introduce into wood _creosote in a state of vapour_, but the process\r\nwas found to be too expensive. This was a modification of Maconochie and\r\nLukin’s trials in 1805 and 1811.[11] A similar process has since arisen\r\nin New York: we believe Mr. Renwick, of that place, suggested it.\r\n\r\nSuch were the known labours, when Dr. Boucherie, in December, 1837,\r\ndevoted his time to a series of experiments upon timber, with a view to\r\ndiscover some preservative process which should answer the following\r\nrequirements: First, for protecting wood from dry rot or wet rot; second,\r\nfor increasing its hardness; third, for preserving and developing its\r\nflexibility and elasticity; fourth, for preventing its decay, and\r\nthe fissures that result from it, when, after having been used in\r\nconstruction, it is left exposed to the variations of the atmosphere;\r\nfifth, for giving it various and enduring colours and odours; and sixth\r\nand last, for greatly reducing its inflammability.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious coincidence that at Bordeaux, in 1733, the Academy\r\nreceived a memoir relative to the circulation of the sap and coloured\r\nliquids in plants; and it was at Bordeaux, a century afterwards, viz.\r\n1837, that M. Boucherie first mentioned his method.\r\n\r\nM. Boucherie’s process was first discussed in Paris in June, 1840. It\r\nconsists in causing a solution of _sulphate of copper_ to penetrate\r\nto the interior of freshly cut woods, to preserve them from decay; he\r\noccasionally used the chloride of calcium, the _pyrolignite of iron_\r\n(_pyrolignite brut de fer_), _prussiate of iron_, _prussiate of copper_,\r\nand various other metallic salts. As a general rule sulphate of copper\r\nis used; but when the hardness of the wood is desired to be increased,\r\npyrolignite of iron is taken (1 gallon of iron to 6 gallons of water);\r\nand when the object is to render the wood flexible, elastic, and at the\r\nsame time uninflammable, chloride of calcium is used. The liquid is taken\r\nup by the tree either whilst growing in the earth or immediately after it\r\nhas been felled. Not more than two or three months should be allowed to\r\nelapse before the timber is operated upon, but the sooner it undergoes\r\nthe process after being felled the better.\r\n\r\nSulphate of copper is said to be superior to corrosive sublimate. Dr.\r\nBoucherie’s process of the injection of wood with the salts of copper is\r\nas simple as it is easy. For those woods intended for poles it consists\r\nin plunging the base of a branch, furnished with leaves, into a tub\r\ncontaining the solution. The liquid ascends into the branches by the\r\naction of the leaves, and the wood is impregnated with the preservative\r\nsalt. As for logs, the operation consists in cutting down the tree to\r\nbe operated upon; fixing at its base a plank, which is fixed by means\r\nof a screw placed in the centre, and which can be tightened at will\r\nwhen placed in the centre of the tree. This plank has, on the side to\r\nbe applied to the bottom of the tree, a rather thick shield of leather,\r\ncloth, pasteboard, or some other substance, intended to establish a space\r\nbetween it and the wood, sufficient for the preserving fluid to keep in\r\ncontact with the freshly cut surface of the tree. The liquid is brought\r\nthere from a tub or other reservoir, by the help of a slanting pole made\r\non the upper surface of the tree, and in which is put a tube, adapted at\r\nits other extremity to a spigot in the upper reservoir which contains\r\nthe solution. A pressure of 5 mètres suffices; so that the instant the\r\nsap of the tree is drawn away it escapes, and is replaced by the liquid\r\nsaturated with sulphate of copper. The proportion of sulphate of copper\r\nin the solution should be 1 lb. of the salt to 12½ gallons of water. As\r\nsoon as the operation terminates (and it lasts for some hours for the\r\nmost difficult logs), the wood is ready for use.\r\n\r\nFor various practical reasons, the first invention of impregnating the\r\nwood of the tree whilst still in a growing state, causing it to suck\r\nup various solutions by means of the absorbing power of the leaves\r\nthemselves, was subsequently abandoned; and at the present time a cheap,\r\nsimple, and effective process is adopted for impregnating the felled\r\ntimbers with the preserving liquid, designated in France “trait de scie,\r\net la cuisse foulante.” The trunk of a newly felled tree is cut into a\r\nlength suitable for two railway sleepers; a cross cut is made on the\r\nprostrate timber to nearly nine-tenths of its diameter; a wedge is then\r\ninserted, and a cord is wound round on the cut surface, leaving a shallow\r\nchamber in the centre, when it is then closed by withdrawing the wedge.\r\nA tube is then inserted through an auger hole into this chamber, and to\r\nthis tube is attached an elastic connecting tube from a reservoir placed\r\nsome 20 or 30 feet above the level on which the wood lies, and a stream\r\nof the saturating fluid with this pressure passes into the chamber,\r\npresses on the sap in the sap tubes, expels it at each end of the tree,\r\nand itself supplies its place. The fluid used is a solution of copper in\r\nwater, in the proportion of 10 or 12 per cent., and a chemical test that\r\nascertains the pressure of the copper solution is applied at each end of\r\nthe tree from which the sap exudes, by which the operator ascertains when\r\nthe process is completed.\r\n\r\nA full account of this process may be found in the number for June,\r\n1840, of ‘Les Annales de Chimie et de Physique.’ Messrs. de Mirbel,\r\nArago, Poucelet, Andouin, Gambey, Boussingault, and Dumas, on the part\r\nof l’Académie des Sciences, made a report upon Dr. Boucherie’s process,\r\nconfirming the value of the invention. In France, Dr. Boucherie, some\r\nyears since, relinquished his brévet, and threw the process open to the\r\npublic, in consideration of a national reward; whilst in England he\r\nhas obtained two patents (1838 and 1841), which, however, are similar\r\nto Bethell’s patent, obtained by him on July 11, 1838: _which is the\r\nsame day and year of Boucherie’s patent_. A prize medal was awarded for\r\nDr. Boucherie’s process at the Great Exhibition in London, in 1851,\r\nand a grande médaille d’honneur, at the Paris Exhibition of 1855. Many\r\nthousands of railway sleepers have been prepared by this process, and\r\nlaid down on the Great Northern Railway of France, and are at present\r\nperfectly sound, whilst others not prepared, on the same line, have\r\nrotted. Boucherie’s process was used on Belgium railways up to 1859; and\r\nit is to be regretted that the reasons which led to its abandonment have\r\nnot been given in the reports of the railway administration, as such\r\nreasons would have afforded reliable data for future experimentalists to\r\ngo upon.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Légé and Fleury-Pironnet’s patent for the injection of sulphate\r\nof copper into beech and poplar is as follows: After the wood is placed,\r\nand the opening hermetically sealed, a jet of steam is introduced,\r\nintended at first to enter the timber and open its pores for the\r\npurpose of obtaining a sudden vacuum, so as to establish at any time a\r\ncommunication between the interior of the cylinder and the cold water\r\ncondenser; at the same time the air pump is put in action. The vacuum\r\ncaused is very powerful, and is equal to 25½ ins. of the barometer.\r\nUnder the double influence of the heat and the vacuum the sap is quickly\r\nevaporated from the wood as steam, and ejected from the cylinder by the\r\nair pump, so that in a very short time the wood is fully prepared to\r\nadmit the preserving liquid through the entire bulk.\r\n\r\nThe use of sulphate of copper for preserving timber has not been,\r\nhowever, confined to France, for about the time Dr. Boucherie brought\r\nforward his process, a Mr. Margary took out a patent in England for the\r\nuse of the same material. His method consists in steeping the substances\r\nto be preserved in a solution of sulphate of copper, of the strength\r\nof 1 lb. of the sulphate to 8 gallons of water, and leaving them in it\r\ntill thoroughly saturated. The timber is allowed to remain in the tank\r\ntwo days for every inch of its thickness. Another method is to place\r\nthe timber in a closed iron vessel of great strength, and it is made to\r\nimbibe the solution by exhaustion and pressure, the operation occupying\r\nbut a short time.\r\n\r\nSulphate of copper is sold in quantities at 4_d._ per lb.; so that\r\n100_l._ would buy 6000 lb., and each pound weight is sufficient for 7\r\nor 8 gallons of water, according to Margary; or 12 gallons of water,\r\naccording to Boucherie.\r\n\r\nTo preserve railway sleepers, the French railway engineers require ¼\r\nlb. of sulphate of copper per cubic foot, say at least 12 lbs. to the\r\nload of 50 feet, to be used in a 2 per cent. solution; so that a load\r\nof timber can be rendered imperishable for the sum of four shillings,\r\nexclusive of labour, if sulphate of copper be reckoned at 4_d._ per lb.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the use of pyrolignite of iron, Mr. Bethell considers it\r\nan expensive process, the pyrolignite costing 6_d._ to 9_d._ per gallon,\r\nwhilst the oil of tar can be delivered at from 2_d._ to 3_d._ per gallon:\r\nthe cost of these materials is constantly varying.\r\n\r\nA great many sleepers were prepared on the Great Western Railway by\r\npyrolignite of iron, and all have _decayed_. Their black colour makes\r\nthem exactly resemble creosoted sleepers, and _many mistakes_ have arisen\r\nfrom this resemblance.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Dorsett and Blythé’s (of Bordeaux) patent process of preparing\r\nwood by the injection of heated solutions of sulphate of copper is\r\nsaid to have been adopted by French, Spanish, and Italian, as well as\r\nother continental railway companies, by the French Government for their\r\nnavy and other constructions, and by telegraph companies for poles\r\non continental lines. It is as cheap as creosote, and is employed in\r\nplaces where creosote cannot be had. Wood prepared by it is rendered\r\nincombustible. Wood for outdoor purposes so prepared has a clean\r\nyellowish surface, without odour; it requires no painting, remains\r\nunchangeable for any length of time, and can be employed for any purpose,\r\nthe same as unprepared material, and carried with other cargo without\r\nhindrance.[12] Messrs. Dorsett and Blythé’s process is similar to that\r\nof Mr. Knab, which consisted of a solution of sulphate of copper, heated\r\nto nearly boiling point, and placed in a lead cylinder, protected by wood.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, 80,000 sleepers, treated with sulphate of copper, were laid down\r\non French railways, and after nine years’ exposure were found to be as\r\nperfect as when first laid.\r\n\r\nMr. H. W. Lewis, University of Michigan, U.S., thus writes in the\r\n‘Journal’ of the Franklin Institute, in 1866, with reference to the decay\r\nof American railway sleepers: “Allowing 2112 sleepers per mile, at 50\r\ncents each, 1056 dols. per mile of American railroad decay every seven\r\nyears. Thoroughly impregnate those sleepers with sulphate of copper, at\r\na cost of 5 cents each, and they would last twice as long. Thus would be\r\neffected a saving of 880 dols. per mile in the seven years on sleepers\r\nalone. In the United States, there are 33,906·6 miles of railroad. The\r\nwhole saving on these lines would be 29,389,568 dols., or upwards of\r\n4,262,795 dols. per annum.”\r\n\r\nWith reference to the decay of unprepared wooden sleepers, it may be here\r\nstated that the renewal of wooden sleepers on the Calcutta and Delhi\r\nIndian line alone costs annually 130,000_l._\r\n\r\nThe preservative action of sulphate of copper on wood has long been\r\nknown, but there are several things in its action which require\r\nexplanation. The ‘London Review’ says that Kœnig has lately investigated\r\nthe chemical reactions which occur when wood is impregnated with a\r\npreservative solution of blue vitriol. He finds, as a general rule,\r\nthat a certain quantity of basic sulphate of copper remains combined\r\nin the pores of the wood in such a manner that it cannot be washed out\r\nwith water. The copper salt may be seen by its green colour in the\r\nspaces between the yearly rings in the less compact portions of the\r\nwood, that is to say, in those portions which contain the sap. Those\r\nvarieties of wood which contain the most resin retain the largest amount\r\nof the copper salt--oak, for example, retaining but little of it. The\r\nligneous fibre itself appears to have little or nothing to do with the\r\nfluxation of the copper salt, and indeed none whatever is retained in\r\nchemical combination, so that it cannot be washed out with water, by\r\npure cellulose. When wood, from which all resin has been extracted by\r\nboiling alcohol, is impregnated with sulphate of copper, it does not\r\nbecome coloured like the original resinous wood, and the copper salt\r\ncontained in it may be readily washed out with water. In like manner,\r\nfrom impregnated resinous wood all the copper salt may be removed, with\r\nthe resin, by means of alcohol. The constituents of the blue vitriol are\r\nconsequently fixed in the wood by means of the resin which this contains.\r\nFurther, it is found that the impregnated wood contains less nitrogen\r\nthan that which is unimpregnated, and that it is even possible to remove\r\nall the nitrogenous components of the wood by long-continued treatment\r\nwith the solution of sulphate of copper; the nitrogenous matters being\r\nsoluble in an excess of this solution, just as the precipitate which\r\nforms when aqueous solutions of albumen and sulphate of copper are mixed\r\nis soluble in excess of the latter. Since the nitrogenous matters\r\nare well known to be promoters of putrefaction, their removal readily\r\naccounts for the increased durability of the impregnated wood. The\r\nutility of blue vitriol as a preservative may also depend on a measure\r\nupon the resinous copper salt which is formed, by which the pores of the\r\nwood are more or less filled up, and the ligneous fibre covered, so that\r\ncontact with the air is prevented, and the attack of insects hindered. It\r\nis suggested that those cases in which the anticipated benefits have not\r\nbeen realized in practice, by impregnating wood with a solution of blue\r\nvitriol, may probably be referred to the use of an insufficient amount of\r\nthis agent; that is, where the wood was not immersed in the solution for\r\na sufficient length of time. The action should be one of lixiviation, not\r\nmerely of absorption.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, a German, named Müenzing, a chemist of Heibronn, proposed\r\n_chloride of manganese_ (waste liquor in the manufacture of bleaching\r\npowder) as a preservative against dry rot in timber; but his process has\r\nnot been adopted in England, and very little noticed abroad.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1841, Mr. Payne patented his invention for _sulphate of iron_\r\nin London; and in June and November, 1846, in France; and in 1846 in\r\nLondon, for _carbonate of soda_.[13] The materials employed in Payne’s\r\nprocess are sulphate of iron and sulphate of lime, both being held in\r\nsolution with water. The timber is placed in a cylinder in which a vacuum\r\nis formed by the condensation of steam, assisted by air pumps; a solution\r\nof sulphate of iron is then admitted into the vessel, which instantly\r\ninsinuates itself into all the pores of the wood, previously freed from\r\nair by the vacuum, and, after about a minute’s exposure, impregnates\r\nits entire substance; the _sulphate of iron_ is then withdrawn, and\r\nanother solution of _sulphate of lime_ thrown in, which enters the\r\nsubstance of the wood in the same manner as the former solution, and the\r\ntwo salts react upon each other, and form two new combinations within\r\nthe substance of the wood--muriate of iron, and muriate of lime. One\r\nof the most valuable properties of timber thus prepared is its perfect\r\nincombustibility: when exposed to the action of flame or strong heat, it\r\nsimply smoulders, and emits no flame. We may also reasonably infer that\r\nwith such a compound in its pores, decay must be greatly retarded, and\r\nthe liability to worms lessened, if not prevented. The greatest drawback\r\nconsists in the increased difficulty of working. This invention has been\r\napproved by the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, and has received\r\nmuch approbation from the architectural profession. Mr. Hawkshaw, C.E.,\r\nconsiders that this process renders wood brittle. It was employed for\r\nrendering wood uninflammable in the Houses of Parliament (we presume,\r\nin the carcase; for _steaming_ was used for the joiner’s work), British\r\nMuseum, and other public buildings; and also for the Royal Stables at\r\nClaremont.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, Mr. Bethell stated before the Institute of Civil Engineers,\r\nLondon, that _silicate of potash_, or _soluble glass_, rendered wood\r\nuninflammable.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, Professor Brande proposed _corrosive sublimate_ in _turpentine_,\r\nor _oil of tar_, as a preservative solution.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, Mr. Ransome suggested the application of _silicate of soda_,\r\nto be afterwards decomposed by an acid in the fibre of the wood; and\r\nin 1846, Mr Payne proposed soluble sulphides of the earth (_barium\r\nsulphide_, &c.), to be also afterwards decomposed in the woods by acids.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, a writer in the ‘Builder’ suggested an equal mixture of alum\r\nand borax (biborate of soda) to be used for making wood uninflammable.\r\nWe have no objection to the use of alum and borax to render wood\r\nuninflammable, providing it does not _hurt the wood_.\r\n\r\nSuch are the _principal_ patents, suggestions, and inventions, up to the\r\nyear 1856; but there are many more which have been brought before the\r\npublic, some of which we will now describe.\r\n\r\nDr. Darwin, some years since, proposed absorption, first, of _lime\r\nwater_, then of a weak solution of _sulphuric acid_, drying between the\r\ntwo, so as to form a gypsum (sulphate of lime) in the pores of the wood,\r\nthe latter to be previously well seasoned, and when prepared to be used\r\nin a dry situation.\r\n\r\nDr. Parry has recommended a preparation composed of _bees-wax_, _roll\r\nbrimstone_, and _oil_, in the proportion of 1, 2, and 3 ounces to ¾\r\ngallon of water; to be boiled together and laid on hot.\r\n\r\nMr. Pritchard, C.E., of Shoreham, succeeded in establishing _pyrolignite\r\nof iron_ and _oil of tar_ as a preventive of dry rot; the pyrolignite to\r\nbe used very pure, the oil applied afterwards, and to be perfectly free\r\nfrom any particle of ammonia.\r\n\r\nMr. Toplis recommends the introduction into the pores of the timber of\r\na solution of sulphate or muriate of iron; the solution may be in the\r\nproportion of about 2 lb. of the salt to 4 or 5 gallons of water.\r\n\r\nAn invention has been lately patented by Mr. John Cullen, of the North\r\nLondon Railway, Bow, for preserving wood from decay. The inventor\r\nproposes to use a composition of _coal-tar_, _lime_, and _charcoal_;\r\nthe charcoal to be reduced to a fine powder, and also the lime. These\r\nmaterials to be well mixed, and subjected to heat, and the wood immersed\r\ntherein. The impregnation of the wood with the composition may be\r\nmaterially aided by means of exhaustion and pressure. Wood thus prepared\r\nis considered to be proof against the attacks of the white ant.\r\n\r\nThe process of preserving wood from decay invented by Mr. L. S. Robins,\r\nof New York, was proposed to be worked extensively by the “British Patent\r\nWood Preserving Company.” It consists in first removing the surface\r\nmoisture, and then charging and saturating the wood with hot _oleaginous\r\nvapours_ and compounds. As the Robins’ process applies the preserving\r\nmaterial in the form of vapour, the wood is left clean, and after a\r\nfew hours’ exposure to the air it is said to be fit to be handled for\r\nany purposes in which elegant workmanship is required. Neither science\r\nnor extraordinary skill is required in conducting the process, and the\r\ntreatment under the patent is said to involve only a trifling expense.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the use of _petroleum_. The almost\r\nunlimited supply of it within the last few years has opened out a new\r\nand almost boundless source of wealth. An invention has been patented\r\nin the name of Mr. A. Prince, which purports to be an improvement in\r\nthe mode of preserving timber by the aid of petroleum. The invention\r\nconsists, firstly, in the immersion of the timber in a suitable vessel or\r\nreceptacle, and to exhaust the air therefrom, by the ordinary means of\r\npreserving wood by saturation. The crude petroleum is next conveyed into\r\nthe vessel, and thereby caused to penetrate into every pore or interstice\r\nof the woody fibre, the effect being, it is said, to thoroughly preserve\r\nthe wood from decay. He also proposes to mix any cheap mineral paint or\r\npigment with crude petroleum to be used as a coating for the bottom of\r\nships before the application of the sheathing, and also to all timber\r\nfor building or other purposes. The composition is considered to render\r\nthe timber indestructible, and to repel the attacks of insects. Without\r\nexpressing any opinion upon this patent as applied to wood for building\r\npurposes, we must again draw attention to the high inflammability of\r\npetroleum.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Journal’ of the Board of Arts and Manufactures for Upper Canada\r\nconsiders the following to be the cheapest and the best mode of\r\npreserving timber in Canada: Let the timbers be placed in a drying\r\nchamber for a few hours, where they would be exposed to a temperature of\r\nabout 200°, so as to drive out all moisture, and by heat, coagulate the\r\nalbuminous substance, which is so productive of decay. Immediately upon\r\nbeing taken out of the drying chamber, they should be thrown into a tank\r\ncontaining crude petroleum. As the wood cools, the air in the pores will\r\ncontract, and the petroleum occupy the place it filled. Such is the\r\nextraordinary attraction shown by this substance for dry surfaces, that\r\nby the process called capillary attraction, it would gradually find its\r\nway into the interior of the largest pieces of timber, and effectually\r\ncoat the walls and cells, and interstitial spaces. During the lapse of\r\ntime, the petroleum would absorb oxygen, and become inspissated, and\r\nfinally converted into a bituminous substance, which would effectually\r\nshield the wood from destruction by the ordinary processes of decay. The\r\nprocess commends itself on account of its cheapness. A drying chamber\r\nmight easily be constructed of sheet iron properly strengthened, and\r\npetroleum is very abundant and accessible. Immediately after the pieces\r\nof timber have been taken out of the petroleum vat, they should be\r\nsprinkled with wood ashes in order that a coating of this substance may\r\nadhere to the surface, and carbonate of potash be absorbed to a small\r\ndepth. The object of this is to render the surface incombustible; and\r\ndusting with wood ashes until quite dry will destroy this property to a\r\ncertain extent.\r\n\r\nThe woodwork of farm buildings in this country is sometimes subjected\r\nto the following: Take two parts of _gas-tar_, one part of _pitch_, one\r\npart _half caustic lime_ and _half common resin_; mix and boil these\r\nwell together, and put them on the wood quite hot. Apply two or three\r\ncoats, and while the last coat is still warm, dash on it a quantity of\r\nwell-washed sharp sand, previously prepared by being sifted through\r\na sieve. The surface of the wood will then have a complete stone\r\nappearance, and may be durable. It is, of course, necessary, that the\r\nwood be perfectly dry, and one coat should be well hardened before the\r\nnext is put on. It is necessary, by the use of lime and long boiling,\r\nto get quit of the ammonia of the tar, as it is considered to injure the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nMr. Abel, the eminent chemist to the War Department, recommends the\r\napplication of _silicate of soda_ in solution, for giving to wood, when\r\napplied to it like paint, a hard coating, which is durable for several\r\nyears, and is also a considerable protection against fire. The silicate\r\nof soda, which is prepared for use in the form of a thick syrup, is\r\ndiluted in water in the proportion of 1 part by measure of the syrup\r\nto 4 parts of water, which is added slowly, until a perfect mixture is\r\nobtained by constant stirring. The wood is then washed over _two_ or\r\n_three_ times with this liquid by means of an ordinary whitewash brush,\r\nso as to absorb as much of it as possible. When this first coating is\r\nnearly dry, the wood is painted over with _another_ wash made by slaking\r\ngood fat lime, diluted to the consistency of thick cream. Then, after the\r\nlimewash has become moderately dry, _another_ solution of the silicate\r\nof soda, in the proportion of 1 of soda to 2 of water, is applied in\r\nthe same manner as the first coating. The preparation of the wood is\r\nthen complete; but if the lime coating has been applied too quickly, the\r\nsurface of the wood may be found, when quite dry, after the last coating\r\nof the silicate, to give off a little lime when rubbed with the hand; in\r\nwhich case it should be _once more_ coated over with a solution of the\r\nsilicate of the same strength as in the first operation. If Mr. Abel had\r\nbeen an architect or builder, he would never have invented this process.\r\nWhat would the cost be? and would not a special clerk of the works be\r\nnecessary to carry out this method in practice?\r\n\r\nThe following coating for piles and posts, to prevent them from rotting,\r\nhas been recommended on account of its being economical, impermeable\r\nto water, and nearly as hard as stone: Take 50 parts of _resin_, 40 of\r\n_finely powdered chalk_, 300 parts of _fine white sharp sand_, 4 parts\r\nof _linseed oil_, 1 part of native _red oxide of copper_, and 1 part\r\nof _sulphuric acid_. First, heat the resin, chalk, sand, and oil, in\r\nan iron boiler; then add the oxide, and, with care, the acid; stir the\r\ncomposition carefully, and apply the coat while it is still hot. If it be\r\nnot liquid enough, add a little more oil. This coating, when it is cold\r\nand dry, forms a varnish which is as hard as stone.\r\n\r\nAnother method for fencing, gate-posts, garden stakes, and timber which\r\nis to be buried in the earth, may be mentioned. Take 11 lb. of _blue\r\nvitriol_ (sulphate of copper) and 20 quarts of water; dissolve the\r\nvitriol with boiling water, and then add the remainder of the water. The\r\nend of the wood is then to be put into the solution, and left to stand\r\nfour or five days; for shingle, three days will answer, and for posts, 6\r\ninches square, ten days, Care should be taken that the saturation takes\r\nplace in a well-pitched tank or keyed box, for the reason that any barrel\r\nwill be shrunk by the operation so as to leak. Instead of expanding an\r\nold cask, as other liquids do, this shrinks it. This solution has also\r\nbeen used in dry rot cases, when the wood is only slightly affected.\r\n\r\nIt will sometimes be found that when oak fencing is put up new, and\r\ntarred or painted, a fungus will vegetate through the dressing, and the\r\ninterior of the wood be rapidly destroyed; but when undressed it seems\r\nthat the weather desiccates the gum or sap, and leaves only the woody\r\nfibre, and the fence lasts for many years.\r\n\r\nAbout fifteen years ago, Professor Crace Calvert, F.R.S., made an\r\ninvestigation for the Admiralty, of the qualities of different woods\r\nused in ship-building. He found the goodness of teak to consist in the\r\nfact that it is highly charged with _caoutchouc_; and he considered\r\nthat if the tannin be soaked out of a block of oak, it may then be\r\ninterpenetrated by a _solution of caoutchouc_, and thereby rendered as\r\nlasting as teak.\r\n\r\nWe can only spare the space for a few words about this method.\r\n\r\n1st. We have seen lead which has formed part of the gutter of a building\r\nprevious to its being burnt down: lead melts at 612° F.; caoutchouc at\r\n248° F.; therefore caoutchouc would not prevent wood from being destroyed\r\nby fire. At 248° caoutchouc is highly inflammable, burns with a white\r\nflame and much smoke.\r\n\r\n2nd. We are informed by a surgical bandage-maker of high repute, that\r\ncaoutchouc, when used in elastic kneecaps, &c., _will perish_, if\r\nthe articles are left in a drawer for two or three years. When hard,\r\ncaoutchouc is brittle.\r\n\r\nWould it be advisable to interpenetrate oak with a solution of\r\ncaoutchouc? In 1825, Mr. Hancock proposed a solution of 1½ lb. of\r\ncaoutchouc in 3 lb. of essential oil, to which was to be added 9 lb. of\r\ntar. Mr. Parkes, in 1843, and M. Passez, in 1845, proposed to dissolve\r\ncaoutchouc in sulphur: painting or immersing the wood. Maconochie, in\r\n1805, after his return from India, proposed distilled _teak_ chips to be\r\ninjected into fir woods.\r\n\r\nAlthough England has been active in endeavouring to discover the best\r\nand cheapest remedy for dry rot, France has also been active in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nM. le Comte de Chassloup Lambat, Member of the late Imperial Senate of\r\nFrance, considers that, as _sulphur_ is most prejudicial to all species\r\nof fungi, there might, perhaps, be some means of making it serviceable\r\nin the preservation of timber. We know with what success it is used in\r\nmedicine. It is also known that coopers burn a sulphur match in old\r\ncasks before using them--a practice which has evidently for its object\r\nthe prevention of mustiness, often microscopic, which would impart a bad\r\nflavour to the wine.\r\n\r\nM. de Lapparent, late Inspector-General of Timber for the French Navy,\r\nproposed to prevent the growth of fungi by the use of a paint having\r\nflour of sulphur as a basis, and linseed oil as an amalgamater. In 1862\r\nhe proposed charring wood; we have referred to this process in our last\r\nchapter (p. 96).\r\n\r\nThe paint was to be composed of:\r\n\r\n    Flour of sulphur              200 grammes    3,088 grains.\r\n    Common linseed oil            135    ”       2,084   ”\r\n    Prepared oil of manganese      30    ”         463   ”\r\n\r\nHe considered that by smearing here and there either the surfaces of\r\nthe ribs of a ship, or below the ceiling, with this paint, a slightly\r\nsulphurous atmosphere will be developed in the hold, which will purify\r\nthe air by destroying, at least in part, the sporules of the fungi. He\r\nhas since stated that his anticipations have been fully realized. M. de\r\nLapparent also proposes to prevent the decay of timber by subjecting\r\nit to a skilful carbonization with common inflammable coal gas. An\r\nexperiment was made at Cherbourg, which was stated to be completely\r\nsuccessful. The cost is only about 10 cents per square yard of framing\r\nand planking.[14] M. de Lapparent’s gas method is useful for burning\r\noff old paint. We saw it in practice (April, 1875) at Waterloo Railway\r\nStation, London, and it appeared to be effective.\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of MM. Le Châtelier (Engineer-in-chief of mines) and\r\nFlachat, C.E.’s, M. Ranee, a few years since, injected in a Légé and\r\nFleury cylinder certain pieces of white fir, red fir, and pitch pine with\r\n_chloride of sodium_, which had been deprived of the manganesian salts\r\nit contained, to destroy its deliquescent property. Some pieces were\r\ninjected four times, but the greatest amount of solution injected into\r\npitch pine heart-wood was from 3 to 4 per cent., and very little more\r\nwas injected into the white and red fir heart-wood. It was also noticed\r\nthat sapwood, after being injected four times, only gained 8 per cent.\r\nin weight in the last three operations. The experiments made to test the\r\nrelative incombustibility of the injected wood showed that the process\r\nwas a complete failure; the prepared wood burning as quickly as the\r\nunprepared wood.\r\n\r\nM. Paschal le Gros, of Paris, has patented his system for preserving\r\nall kinds of wood, by means of a _double salt of manganese_ and of\r\n_zinc_, used either alone or with an admixture of _creosote_. The\r\nsolution, obtained in either of the two ways, is poured into a trough,\r\nand the immersion of the logs or pieces of wood is effected by placing\r\nthem vertically in the trough in such a manner that they are steeped\r\nin the liquid to about three-quarters of their length. The wood is\r\nthus subjected to the action of the solution during a length of time\r\nvarying from twelve to forty-eight hours. The solution rises in the\r\nfibres of the wood, and impregnates them by the capillary force alone,\r\nwithout requiring any mechanical action. The timber is said to become\r\nincombustible, hard, and very lasting.\r\n\r\nM. Fontenay, C.E., in 1832, proposed to act upon the wood with what he\r\ndesignated _metallic soap_, which could be obtained from the residue in\r\ngreasing boxes of carriages; also from the acid remains of _oil_, _suet_,\r\n_iron_, and _brass dust_; all being melted together. In 1816 Chapman\r\ntried experiments with _yellow soap_; but to render it sufficiently fluid\r\nit required forty times its weight of water, in which the quantity of\r\nresinous matter and tallow would scarcely exceed ⅟80th; therefore no\r\ngreater portion of these substances could be left in the pores of the\r\nwood, which could produce little effect.\r\n\r\nM. Letellier, in 1837, proposed to use _deuto-chloride of mercury_ as a\r\npreservative for wood.\r\n\r\nM. Dondeine’s process was formerly used in France and Germany. It is a\r\npaint, consisting of many ingredients, the principal being _linseed oil,\r\nresin, white lead, vermilion, lard, and oxide of iron_. All these are to\r\nbe well mixed, and reduced by boiling to one-tenth, and then applied\r\nwith a brush. If applied cold, a little varnish or turpentine to be added.\r\n\r\nLittle is known in England of the inventions which have arisen in foreign\r\ncountries not already mentioned.\r\n\r\nM. Szerelmey, a Hungarian, proposed, in 1868, _potassa_, _lime_,\r\n_sulphuric acid_, _petroleum_, &c., to preserve wood.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the following method is sometimes used for the preservation\r\nof wood: Mix 40 parts of _chalk_, 40 parts of _resin_, 4 of _linseed\r\noil_; melting them together in an iron pot; then add 1 part of native\r\n_oxide of copper_, and afterwards, carefully, 1 part of _sulphuric acid_.\r\nThe mixture is applied while hot to the wood by means of a brush, and it\r\nsoon becomes very hard.[15]\r\n\r\nMr. Cobley, of Meerholz, Hesse, has patented the following preparation.\r\nA strong solution of _potash_, _baryta_, _lime_, _strontia_, or any of\r\ntheir salts, are forced into the pores of timber in a close iron vessel\r\nby a pump. After this operation, the liquid is run off from the timber,\r\nand _hydro-fluo-silicic acid_ is forced in, which, uniting with the salts\r\nin the timber, forms an insoluble compound capable of rendering the wood\r\nuninflammable.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1800, Neils Nystrom, chemist, Norkopping, recommended\r\na solution of _sea salt and copperas_, to be laid upon timber as hot\r\nas possible, to prevent rottenness or combustion. He also proposed a\r\nsolution of _sulphate of iron_, _potash_, _alum_, &c., to extinguish\r\nfires.\r\n\r\nM. Louis Vernet, Buenos Ayres, proposed to preserve timber from fire by\r\nthe use of the following mixture: Take 1 lb. of _arsenic_, 6 lb. of\r\n_alum_, and 10 lb. of _potash_, in 40 gallons of water, and mix with\r\n_oil_, or any suitable tarry matters, and paint the timber with the\r\nsolution. We have already referred to the conflicting evidence respecting\r\nalum and water for wood: we can now state that Chapman’s experiments\r\nproved that _arsenic_ afforded no protection against dry rot. Experiments\r\nin Cornwall have proved that where arsenical ores have lain on the\r\nground, vegetation will ensue in two or three years after removal of the\r\nore. If, therefore, alum or arsenic have no good effect on timber with\r\nrespect to the dry rot, we think the use of both of them together would\r\ncertainly be objectionable.\r\n\r\nThe last we intend referring to is a composition frequently used in\r\nChina, for preserving wood. Many buildings in the capital are painted\r\nwith it. It is called _Schoicao_, and is made with 3 parts of blood\r\ndeprived of its febrine, 4 parts of lime and a little alum, and 2 parts\r\nof liquid silicate of soda. It is sometimes used in Japan.\r\n\r\nIt would be practically useless to quote any further remedies, and the\r\nreader is recommended to carefully study those quoted in this chapter,\r\nand of their utility to judge for himself, bearing in mind those\r\nprinciples which we have referred to before commencing to describe the\r\npatent processes. A large number of patents have been taken out in\r\nEngland for the preservation of wood by preservative processes, but\r\nonly two are now in use,--that is, to any extent,--viz. Bethell’s and\r\nBurnett’s. Messrs. Bethell and Co. now impregnate timber with _copper,\r\nzinc, corrosive sublimate, or creosote_; the four best patents.\r\n\r\nWe insert here a short analysis of different _methods_ proposed for\r\nseasoning timber:--\r\n\r\n    Vacuum and Pressure Processes generally.\r\n\r\n    Bréant’s.\r\n    Bethell’s.\r\n    Payne’s.\r\n    Perin’s.\r\n    Tissier’s.\r\n\r\n    Vacuum by Condensation of Steam.\r\n\r\n    Tissier.\r\n    Bréant.\r\n    Payne.\r\n    Renard Perin, 1848.\r\n    Brochard and Watteau, 1847.\r\n\r\n    Separate Condenser.\r\n\r\n    Tissier.\r\n\r\n    Employ Sulphate of Copper in closed vessels.\r\n\r\n    Bethell’s Patent, 11th July, 1838.\r\n    Tissier, 22nd October, 1844.\r\n    Molin’s Paper, 1853.\r\n    Payen’s Pamphlet.\r\n    Légé and Fleury’s Pamphlet.\r\n\r\n    Current of Steam.\r\n\r\n    Moll’s Patent, 19th January, 1835.\r\n    Tissier’s ” 22nd October, 1844.\r\n    Payne’s ” 14th Nov., 1846.\r\n    Meyer d’Uslaw, 2nd January, 1851.\r\n    Payen’s Pamphlet.\r\n\r\n    Hot Solution.\r\n\r\n    Tissier’s Patent, 22nd October, 1844.\r\n    Knab’s Patent, 8th September, 1846.\r\n\r\n    Most solutions used are heated.\r\n\r\nThe following are the chief _ingredients_ which have been recommended,\r\nand some of them tried, to prevent the decomposition of timber, and the\r\ngrowth of fungi:--\r\n\r\n    Acid, Sulphuric.\r\n      ”   Vitriolic.\r\n      ”   of Tar.\r\n    Carbonate of Potash.\r\n        ”        Soda.\r\n        ”        Barytes.\r\n    Sulphate of Copper.\r\n       ”        Iron.\r\n       ”        Zinc.\r\n       ”        Lime.\r\n       ”        Magnesia.\r\n       ”        Barytes.\r\n       ”        Alumina.\r\n       ”        Soda.\r\n    Salt, Neutral.\r\n    Salt, Selenites.\r\n    Oil, Vegetable.\r\n     ”   Animal.\r\n     ”   Mineral.\r\n    Muriate of Soda.\r\n    Marcosites, Mundic.\r\n       ”        Barytes.\r\n    Nitrate of Potash.\r\n    Animal Glue.\r\n      ”    Wax.\r\n    Quick Lime.\r\n    Resins of different kinds.\r\n    Sublimate, Corrosive.\r\n    Peat Moss.\r\n\r\nFor the _non-professional_ reader we find we have _three_ facts:\r\n\r\n1st. The most successful patentees have been Bethell and Burnett, in\r\nEngland; and Boucherie, in France: all B’s.\r\n\r\n2nd. The most successful patents have been _knighted_. Payne’s patent\r\nwas, we believe, used by Sirs R. Smirke and C. Barry; Kyan’s, by Sir\r\nR. Smirke; Burnett’s, by Sirs M. Peto, P. Roney, and H. Dryden; while\r\nBethell’s patent can claim Sir I. Brunel, and many other knights. We\r\nbelieve Dr. Boucherie received the Legion of Honour in France.\r\n\r\n3rd. There are only at the present time three timber-preserving works in\r\nLondon, and they are owned by Messrs. Bethell and Co., Sir F. Burnett and\r\nCo., and Messrs. Burt, Boulton, and Co.: all names commencing with the\r\nletter B.\r\n\r\nFor the _professional_ reader we find we have _three hard_ facts:\r\n\r\nThe most successful patents may be placed in three classes, and we give\r\nthe key-note of their success.\r\n\r\n1st. ONE MATERIAL AND ONE APPLICATION.--Creosote, Petroleum.\r\n_Order_--Ancient Egyptians, or Bethell’s, Burmese.\r\n\r\n2nd. TWO MATERIALS AND ONE APPLICATION.--Chloride of zinc and\r\nwater; sulphate of copper and water; corrosive sublimate and water.\r\n_Order_--Burnett, Boucherie, Kyan.\r\n\r\n3rd. TWO MATERIALS AND TWO APPLICATIONS.--Sulphate of iron and water;\r\nafterwards sulphate of lime and water. Payne.\r\n\r\nWe thus observe there are _twice three_ successful patent processes.\r\n\r\nAny inventions which cannot be brought under these three classes have had\r\na short life; at least, we think so.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks will apply to _external_ applications for wood--for\r\ninstance, coal-tar, _one application_, is more used for fencing than any\r\nother material.\r\n\r\nWe are much in want of a valuable series of experiments on the\r\napplication of various chemicals on wood to resist _burning to pieces_;\r\nwithout causing it to _rot speedily_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nON THE MEANS OF PREVENTING DRY ROT IN MODERN HOUSES; AND THE CAUSES OF\r\nTHEIR DECAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough writers on dry rot have generally deemed it a new disease, there\r\nis foundation to believe that it pervaded the British Navy in the reign\r\nof Charles II. “Dry rot received a little attention” so writes Sir John\r\nBarrow, “about the middle of the last century, at some period of Sir John\r\nPringle’s presidency of the Royal Society of London.” As timber trees\r\nwere, no doubt, subject to the same laws and conditions 500 years ago as\r\nthey are at the present day, it is indeed extremely probable that if at\r\nthat time unseasoned timber was used, and subjected to heat and moisture,\r\ndry rot made its appearance. We propose in this chapter to direct\r\nattention to the several causes of the decay of wood, which by proper\r\nbuilding might be averted.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of proper ventilation round the timbers of a building has\r\nbeen repeatedly advised in this volume; for even timber which has been\r\nnaturally seasoned is at all times disposed to resume, from a warm and\r\nstagnant atmosphere, the elements of decay. We cannot therefore agree\r\nwith the following passage from Captain E. M. Shaw’s book on ‘Fire\r\nSurveys,’ which is to be found at page 44:--“Circulation of air should\r\non no account be permitted in any part of a building not exposed to\r\nview, especially under floors, or inside skirting boards, or wainscots.”\r\nIn the course of this chapter, the evil results from a want of a proper\r\ncirculation of air will be shown.\r\n\r\nIn warm cellars, or any close confined situations, where the air is\r\nfilled with vapour without a current to change it, dry rot proceeds\r\nwith astonishing rapidity, and the timber work is destroyed in a very\r\nshort time. The bread rooms of ships; behind the skirtings, and under\r\nthe wooden floors, or the basement stories of houses, particularly in\r\nkitchens, or other rooms where there are constant fires; and, in general,\r\nin every place where wood is exposed to warmth and damp air, the dry rot\r\nwill soon make its appearance.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of stoves are sure to increase the disease if moisture be\r\npresent. The effect of heat is also evident from the rapid decay of ships\r\nin hot climates; and the warm moisture given out by particular cargoes\r\nis also very destructive. Hemp will, without being injuriously heated,\r\nemit a moist warm vapour: so will pepper (which will affect teak) and\r\ncotton. The ship ‘Brothers’ built at Whitby, of green timber, proceeded\r\nto St. Petersburgh for a cargo of hemp. The next year it was found on\r\nexamination that her timbers were rotten, and all the planking, except a\r\nthin external skin. It is also an important fact that rats very rarely\r\nmake their appearance in dry places: under floors they are sometimes very\r\ndestructive.\r\n\r\nAs rats will sometimes destroy the structural parts of wood framing,\r\na few words about them may not be out of place. If poisoned wheat,\r\narsenic, &c., be used, the creatures will simply eat the things and\r\ndie under the floor, causing an intolerable stench. The best method\r\nis to make a small hole in a corner of the floor (unless they make it\r\nthemselves) large enough to permit them to come up; the following course\r\nis then recommended:--Take oil of amber and ox-gall in equal parts; add\r\nto them oatmeal or flour sufficient to form a paste, which divide into\r\nlittle balls, and lay them in the middle of the infested apartment _at\r\nnight_ time. Surround the balls with a number of saucers filled with\r\nwater--the smell of the oil is sure to attract the rats, they will\r\ngreedily devour the balls, and becoming intolerably thirsty will drink\r\ntill they die on the spot. They can be buried in the morning.\r\n\r\nBuilding timber into new walls is often a cause of decay, as the lime and\r\ndamp brickwork are active agents in producing putrefaction, particularly\r\nwhere the scrapings of roads are used, instead of sand, for mortar. Hence\r\nit is that bond timbers, wall plates, and the ends of girders, joists,\r\nand lintels are so frequently found in a state of decay. The ends of\r\nbrestsummers are sometimes cased in sheet lead, zinc, or fire-brick, as\r\nbeing impervious to moisture. The old builders used to bed the ends of\r\ngirders and joists in loam instead of mortar, as directed in the Act of\r\nParliament, 19 Car. II. c. 3, for rebuilding the City of London.\r\n\r\nIn Norway, all posts in contact with the earth are carefully wrapped\r\nround with flakes of birch bark for a few inches above and below the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nTimber that is to lie in mortar--as, for instance, the ends of joists,\r\ndoor sills and frames of doors and windows, and the ends of girders--if\r\npargeted over with hot pitch, will, it is said, be preserved from the\r\neffects of the lime. In taking down, some years since, in France, some\r\nportion of the ancient Château of the Roque d’Oudres, it was found that\r\nthe extremities of the oak girders were perfectly preserved, although\r\nthese timbers were supposed to have been in their places for upwards\r\nof 600 years. The whole of these extremities buried in the walls were\r\ncompletely wrapped round with plates of cork. When demolishing an\r\nancient Benedictine church at Bayonne, it was found that the whole of\r\nthe fir girders were entirely worm eaten and rotten, with the exception,\r\nhowever, of the bearings, which, as in the case just mentioned, were\r\nalso completely wrapped round with plates of cork. These facts deserve\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIf any of our professional readers should wish to try cork for the ends\r\nof girders, they will do well to choose the Spanish cork, which is the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nIn this place it may not be amiss to point out the dangerous consequences\r\nof building walls so that their principal support depends on timber. The\r\nusual method of putting bond timber into walls is to lay it next the\r\ninside; this bond often decays, and, of course, leaves the walls resting\r\nonly upon the external course or courses of brick; and fractures, bulges,\r\nor absolute failures are the natural consequences. This evil is in some\r\ndegree avoided by placing the bond in the middle of the wall, so that\r\nthere is brickwork on each side, and by not putting continued bond for\r\nnailing the battens to. We object to placing bond in the middle of a\r\nwall: the best way, where it can be managed, is to corbel out the wall,\r\nresting the ends of the joists on the top course of bricks; thus doing\r\naway with the wood-plate. In London, wood bond is prohibited by Act of\r\nParliament, and hoop-iron bond (well tarred and sanded) is now generally\r\nused. The following is an instance of the bad effects of placing wood\r\nbond in walls: In taking down portions of the audience part and the\r\nwhole of the corridors of the original main walls of Covent Garden\r\nTheatre, London, in 1847, which had only been built about thirty-five\r\nyears, the wood horizontal bond timbers, although externally appearing\r\nin good condition, were found, on a close examination by Mr. Albano,\r\nmuch affected by shrinkage, and the majority of them quite rotten in the\r\ncentre, consequently the whole of them were ordered to be taken out in\r\nshort lengths, and the space to be filled in with brickwork and cement.\r\n\r\nSome years since we had a great deal to do with “Fire Surveys;” that is\r\nto say, surveying buildings to estimate the cost of reinstating them\r\nafter being destroyed by fire; and we often noticed that the wood bond,\r\nbeing rotten, was seriously charred by the fire, and had to be cut out\r\nin short lengths, and brickwork in cement “pinned in” in its place.\r\nBrestsummers and story posts are rarely sufficiently burnt to affect the\r\nstability of the front wall of a shop building.\r\n\r\nIn bad foundations, it used to be common, before concrete came into\r\nvogue, to lie planks to build upon. Unless these planks were absolutely\r\nwet, they were certain to rot in such situations, and the walls settled;\r\nand most likely irregularly, rending the building to pieces. Instances\r\nof such kind of failure frequently occur. It was found necessary, a few\r\nyears since, to underpin three of the large houses in Grosvenor Place,\r\nLondon, at an immense expense. In one of these houses the floors were not\r\nless than three inches out of level, the planking had been seven inches\r\nthick, and most of it was completely rotten: it was of yellow fir. A like\r\naccident happened to Norfolk House, St. James’s Square, London, where oak\r\nplanking had been used.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the danger of trusting to timber in supporting heavy\r\nstone or brickwork, the failure of the curb of the brick dome of the\r\nchurch of St. Mark, at Venice, may be cited. This dome was built upon\r\na curb of larch timber, put together in thicknesses, with the joints\r\ncrossed, and was intended to resist the tendency which a dome has to\r\nspread outwards at the base. In 1729, a large crack and several smaller\r\nones were observed in the dome. On examination, the wooden curb was\r\nfound to be in a completely rotten state, and it was necessary to raise\r\na scaffold from the bottom to secure the dome from ruin. After it was\r\nsecured from falling, the wooden curb was removed, and a course of stone,\r\nwith a strong band of iron, was put in its place.\r\n\r\nIt is said that another and very important source of destruction is the\r\napplying end to end of two different kinds of wood: oak to fir, oak to\r\nteak or lignum vitæ; the harder of the two will decay at the point of\r\njuncture.\r\n\r\nThe bad effects resulting from damp walls are still further increased by\r\nhasty finishing. To enclose with plastering and joiners’ work the walls\r\nand timbers of a building while they are in a damp state is the most\r\ncertain means of causing the building to fall into a premature state of\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\nMr. George Baker, builder of the National Gallery, London, remarked, in\r\n1835, “I have seen the dry rot all over Baltic timber in three years, in\r\nconsequence of putting it in contact with moist brickwork; the rot was\r\ncaused by the badness of the mortar, it was so long drying.”\r\n\r\nSlating the external surface of a wall, to keep out the rain or damp,\r\nis sometimes adopted: a high wall (nearly facing the south-west) of a\r\nhouse near the north-west corner of Blackfriars Bridge, London, has been\r\nrecently slated from top to bottom, to keep out damp.\r\n\r\nHowever well timber may be seasoned, if it be employed in a damp\r\nsituation, decay is the certain consequence; therefore it is most\r\ndesirable that the neighbourhood of buildings should be well drained,\r\nwhich would not only prevent rot, but also increase materially the\r\ncomfort of those who reside in them. The drains should be made\r\nwater-tight wherever they come near to the walls; as walls, particularly\r\nbrick walls, draw up moisture to a very considerable height: very strict\r\nsupervision should be placed over workmen while the drains of a building\r\nare being laid. Earth should never be suffered to rest against walls,\r\nand the sunk stories of buildings should always be surrounded by an open\r\narea, so that the walls may not absorb moisture from the earth: even open\r\nareas require to be properly built. We will quote a case to explain our\r\nmeaning. A house was erected about eighteen months ago, in the south-east\r\npart of London, on sloping ground. Excavations were made for the basement\r\nfloor, and a dry area, “brick thick, in cement,” was built at the back\r\nand side of the house, the top of the area wall being covered with a\r\nstone coping; we do not know whether the bottom of the area was drained.\r\nOn the top of the coping was placed mould, forming one of the garden beds\r\nfor flowers. Where the mould rested against the walls, damp entered. The\r\narea walls should have been built, in the first instance, above the level\r\nof the garden-ground--which has since been done--otherwise, in course of\r\ntime, the ends of the next floor joists would have become attacked by dry\r\nrot.\r\n\r\nSome people imagine that if damp is in a wall the best way to get rid of\r\nit is to seal it in, by plastering the inside and stuccoing the outside\r\nof the wall; this is a great mistake; damp will rise higher and higher,\r\nuntil it finds an outlet; rotting in the meanwhile the wood bond and\r\nends of all the joists. We were asked recently to advise in a curious\r\ncase of this kind at a house in Croydon. On wet days the wall (_stucco_,\r\noutside; _plaster_, inside) was perfectly wet: bands of soft red bricks\r\nin wall, at intervals, were the culprits. To prevent moisture rising from\r\nthe foundations, some substance that will not allow it to pass should be\r\nused at a course or two above the footings of the walls, but it should\r\nbe below the level of the lowest joists. “Taylor’s damp course” bricks\r\nare good, providing the air-passages in them are kept free for air to\r\npass through: they are allowed sometimes to get choked up with dirt.\r\nSheets of lead or copper have been used for that purpose, but they are\r\nvery expensive. Asphalted felt is quite as good; no damp can pass through\r\nit. Care must, however, be taken in using it if only one wall, say a\r\nparty wall, has to be built. To lay two or three courses of slates,\r\nbedded in cement, is a good method, providing the slates “break joint,”\r\nand are well bedded in the cement. Workmen require watching while this\r\nis being done, because if any opening be left for damp to rise, it will\r\nundoubtedly do so. A better method is to build brickwork a few courses in\r\nheight with Portland cement instead of common mortar, and upon the upper\r\ncourse to lay a bed of cement of about one inch in thickness; or a layer\r\nof asphalte (providing the walls are all carried up to the same level\r\nbefore the asphalte is applied hot). As moisture does not penetrate these\r\nsubstances, they are excellent materials for keeping out wet; and it can\r\neasily be seen if the mineral asphalte has been properly applied. To keep\r\nout the damp from basement floors, lay down cement concrete 6 inches\r\nthick, and on the top, asphalte 1 inch thick, and then lay the sleepers\r\nand joists above; or bed the floor boards on the asphalte.\r\n\r\nThe walls and principal timbers of a building should always be left for\r\nsome time to dry after it is covered in. This drying is of the greatest\r\nbenefit to the work, particularly the drying of the walls; and it also\r\nallows time for the timbers to get settled to their proper bearings,\r\nwhich prevents after-settlements and cracks in the finished plastering.\r\nIt is sometimes said that it is useful because it allows the timber more\r\ntime to season; but when the carpenter considers that it is from the\r\nends of the timber that much of its moisture evaporates, he will see\r\nthe impropriety of leaving it to season after it is framed, and also\r\nthe cause of framed timbers of unseasoned wood failing at the joints\r\nsooner than in any other place. No parts of timber require the perfect\r\nextraction of the sap so much as those that are to be joined.\r\n\r\nWhen the plastering is finished, a considerable time should be allowed\r\nfor the work to get dry again before the skirtings, the floors, and\r\nother joiners’ work be fixed. Drying will be much accelerated by a free\r\nadmission of air, particularly in favourable weather. When a building\r\nis thoroughly dried at first, openings for the admission of fresh air\r\nare not necessary _when the precautions against any new accessions of\r\nmoisture have been effectual_. Indeed, such openings only afford harbour\r\nfor vermin: unfortunately, however, buildings are so rarely dried when\r\nfirst built, that air-bricks, &c., in the floors are very necessary, and\r\nif the timbers were so dried as to be free from water (which could be\r\ndone by an artificial process), the wood would only be fit for joinery\r\npurposes. Few of our readers would imagine that water forms ⅕th part of\r\nwood. Here is a table (compiled from ‘Box on Heat,’ and Péclet’s great\r\nwork ‘Traité de la Chaleur’):--\r\n\r\n               WOOD.\r\n\r\n    Elements.      Ordinary state.\r\n    Carbon                ·408\r\n    Hydrogen              ·042\r\n    Oxygen                ·334\r\n    _Water_              _·200_\r\n    Ashes                 ·016\r\n                         -----\r\n                         1·000\r\n\r\nMany houses at our seaport towns are erected with mortar, having\r\nsea-sand in its composition, and then dry rot makes its appearance. If\r\nno other sand can be obtained, the best way is to have it washed at\r\nleast _three times_ (the contractor being under strict supervision, and\r\nsubject to heavy penalties for evasion). After each washing it should be\r\nleft exposed to the action of the sun, wind, and rain: the sand should\r\nalso be frequently turned over, so that the whole of it may in turn\r\nbe exposed; even then it tastes saltish, after the third operation. A\r\nfriend of ours has a house at Worthing, which was erected a few years\r\nsince with sea-sand mortar, and on a wet day there is always a dampness\r\nhanging about the house--every third year the staircase walls have to be\r\nrepapered: it “bags” from the walls.\r\n\r\nIn floors next the ground we cannot easily prevent the access of damp,\r\nbut this should be guarded against as far as possible. All mould should\r\nbe carefully removed, and, if the situation admits of it, a considerable\r\nthickness of dry materials, such as brickbats, dry ashes, broken glass,\r\nclean pebbles, concrete, or the refuse of vitriol-works; but no lime\r\n(unless unslaked) should be laid under the floor, and over these a\r\ncoat of smiths’ ashes, or of pyrites, where they can be procured. The\r\ntimber for the joists should be well seasoned; and it is advisable to\r\ncut off all connection between wooden ground floors and the rest of the\r\nwoodwork of the building. A flue carried up in the wall next the kitchen\r\nchimney, commencing under the floor, and terminating at the top of the\r\nwall, and covered to prevent the rain entering, would take away the damp\r\nunder a kitchen floor. In Hamburg it is a common practice to apply\r\nmineral asphalte to the basement floors of houses to prevent capillary\r\nattraction; and in the towns of the north of France, gas-tar has become\r\nof very general use to protect the basement of the houses from the\r\neffects of the external damp.\r\n\r\nMany houses in the suburbs (particularly STUCCONIA) of London are erected\r\nby speculating builders. As soon as the carcase of a house is finished\r\n(perhaps before) the builder is unable to proceed, for want of money,\r\nand the carcase is allowed to stand unfinished for months. Showers of\r\nrain saturate the previously unseasoned timbers, and pools of water\r\ncollect on the basement ground, into which they gradually, but surely,\r\nsoak. Eventually the houses are finished (probably by half a dozen\r\ndifferent tradesmen, employed by a mortgagee); bits of wood, rotten\r\nsawdust, shavings, &c., being left under the basement floor. The house\r\nwhen finished, having pretty (!) paper on the walls, plate-glass in the\r\nwindow-sashes, and a bran new brick and stucco portico to the front door,\r\nis quickly let. Dry rot soon appears, accompanied with its companions,\r\nthe many-coloured fungi; and when their presence should be known from\r\ntheir smell, the anxious wife probably exclaims to her husband, “My dear!\r\nthere is a very strange smell which appears to come from the children’s\r\nplayroom: had you not better send for Mr. Wideawake, the builder, for\r\nI am sure there is _something the matter with the drains_.” Defective\r\nventilation, dry rot, _green_ water thrown down sinks, &c., do not cause\r\nsmells, it’s _the drains_, of course!\r\n\r\nThere is another cause which affects all wood most materially, which\r\nis the application of paint, tar, or pitch before the wood has been\r\nthoroughly dried. The nature of these bodies prevents all evaporation;\r\nand the result of this is that the centre of the wood is transformed into\r\ntouchwood. On the other hand, the doors, pews, and carved work of many\r\nold churches have never been painted, and yet they are often found to be\r\nperfectly sound, after having existed more than a century. In Chester,\r\nExeter, and other old cities, where much timber was formerly used, even\r\nfor the external parts of buildings, it appears to be sound and perfect,\r\nthough black with age, and has never been painted.\r\n\r\nMr. Semple, in his treatise on ‘Building in Water,’ mentions an instance\r\nof some field-gates made of home fir, part of which, being near the\r\nmansion, were painted; while the rest, being in distant parts of the\r\ngrounds, were not painted. Those which were painted soon became quite\r\nrotten, but the others, which were not painted, continued sound.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of dry rot, which is sometimes found in suburban and\r\ncountry houses, is the presence of large trees near the house. We are\r\nacquainted with the following remarkable instance:--At the northern end\r\nof Kilburn, London, stands Stanmore Cottage, erected a great many years\r\nago: about fifty feet in front of it is an old elm-tree. The owner, a few\r\nyears since, noticed cracks round the portico of the house; these cracks\r\ngradually increased in size, and other cracks appeared in the window\r\narches, and in different parts of the external and internal walls. The\r\nowner became alarmed, and sent for an experienced builder, who advised\r\nunderpinning the walls. Workmen immediately commenced to remove the\r\nground from the foundations, and it was then found that the foundations,\r\nas well as the joists, were honeycombed by the roots of the elm-tree,\r\nwhich were growing alongside the joists, the whole being surrounded by\r\nlarge masses of white and yellow dry-rot fungus.\r\n\r\nThe insufficient use of tarpaulins is another frequent cause of dry rot.\r\nA London architect had (a few years since) to superintend the erection\r\nof a church in the south-west part of London; an experienced builder was\r\nemployed. The materials were of the best description and quality. When\r\nthe walls were sufficiently advanced to receive the roof, rain set in; as\r\nthe clown in one of Shakespeare’s plays observed, “the rain, it raineth\r\nevery day;” it was so, we are told, in this case for some days. The roof\r\nwhen finished was ceiled below with a plaster ceiling; and above (not\r\nwith “dry oakum without pitch” but) with slates. A few months afterwards\r\nsome of the slates had to be reinstated, in consequence of a heavy storm,\r\nand it was then discovered that nearly all the timbers of the roof were\r\naffected by dry rot. This was an air-tight roof.\r\n\r\nIn situations favourable to rot, painting prevents every degree of\r\nexhalation, depriving at the same time the wood of the influence of the\r\nair, and the moisture runs through it, and insidiously destroys the wood.\r\nMost surveyors know that moist oak cills to window frames will soon rot,\r\nand the painting is frequently renewed; a few taps with a two-feet\r\nbrass rule joint on the top and front of cill will soon prove their\r\ncondition. Wood should be a year or more before it is painted; or, better\r\nstill, never painted at all. Artificers can tell by the sound of any\r\nsubstance whether it be healthy or decayed as accurately as a musician\r\ncan distinguish his notes: thus, a bricklayer strikes the wall with his\r\ncrow, and a carpenter a piece of timber with his hammer. The Austrians\r\nused formerly to try the goodness of the timber for ship-building by the\r\nfollowing method: One person applies his ear to the centre of one end of\r\nthe timber, while another, with a key, hits the other end with a gentle\r\nstroke. If the wood be sound and good, the stroke will be distinctly\r\nheard at the other end, though the timber should be fifty feet or more in\r\nlength. Timber affected with rot yields a particular sound when struck,\r\nbut if it were painted, and the distemper had made much progress, with\r\nno severe stroke the outside breaks like a shell. The auger is a very\r\nuseful instrument for testing wood; the wood or sawdust it brings out can\r\nbe judged by its smell; which may be the fresh smell of pure wood: the\r\nvinous smell, or first degree of fermentation, which is alcoholic; or the\r\nsecond degree, which is putrid. The sawdust may also be tested by rubbing\r\nit between the fingers.\r\n\r\nAccording to Colonel Berrien, the Michigan Central Railroad Bridge, at\r\nNiles, was painted _before seasoning_, with “Ohio fire-proof paint,”\r\nforming a glazed surface. After five years it was so rotten as to require\r\nrebuilding.\r\n\r\nPainted floor-cloths are very injurious to wooden floors, and frequently\r\nproduce rottenness in the floors that are covered with them, as the\r\npainted cloth prevents the access of air, and retains whatever dampness\r\nthe boards may absorb, and therefore soon causes decay. Carpets are not\r\nso injurious, but still assist in retarding free evaporation.\r\n\r\nCaptain E. M. Shaw, in ‘Fire Surveys,’ thus writes of the floors of a\r\nbuilding, “They might with advantage be caulked like a ship’s deck, only\r\nwith dry oakum, without pitch.” Let us see how far oil floor-cloth and\r\nkamptulicon will assist us in obtaining an air-tight floor.\r\n\r\nIn London houses there is generally _one_ room on the basement floor\r\nwhich is carefully covered over with an oiled floor-cloth. In such a room\r\nthe dry rot often makes its appearance. The wood absorbs the aqueous\r\nvapour which the oil-cloth will not allow to escape; and being assisted\r\nby the heat of the air in such apartments, the decay goes on rapidly.\r\nSometimes, however, the dry rot is only confined to the top of the floor.\r\nAt No. 106, Fenchurch Street, London, a wood floor was washed (a few\r\nyears since) for a tenant, and oil-cloth was laid down. Circumstances\r\nnecessitated his removal a few months afterwards; and it was then found\r\nthat the oil-cloth had grown, so to speak, to the wood flooring, and had\r\nto be taken off with a chisel: the dry rot had been engendered merely on\r\nthe surface of the floor boards, as they were sound below as well as the\r\njoists: air bricks were in the front wall.\r\n\r\nWe have seen many instances of dry rot in _passages_, where oiled\r\nfloor-cloth has been nailed down and not been disturbed for two or three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary houses, where floor-cloth is laid down in the _front_\r\nkitchen, no ventilation under the floors, and a fire burning every day\r\nin the stove, dry rot often appears. In the _back_ kitchen, where there\r\nis no floor-cloth, and only an occasional fire, it rarely appears. The\r\nair is warm and stagnant under one floor, and cold and stagnant under the\r\nother: at the temperature of 32° to 40° the progress of dry rot is very\r\nslow.\r\n\r\nAnd how does _kamptulicon_ behave itself? The following instances of\r\nthe rapid progress of dry rot from external circumstances have recently\r\nbeen communicated to us; they show that, under favourable circumstances\r\nas to choice of timber and seasoning, this fungus growth can be readily\r\nproduced by _casing-in_ the timber with substances impervious, or nearly\r\nso, to air.\r\n\r\nAt No. 29, Mincing Lane, London, in _two_ out of three rooms on the\r\n_first_ floor, upon a fire-proof floor constructed on the Fox and Barrett\r\nprinciple (of iron joists and concrete with yellow pine sleepers, on\r\nstrips of wood bedded in cement, to which were nailed the yellow pine\r\nfloor-boards) kamptulicon was nailed down by the tenant’s orders. In less\r\nthan nine months the whole of the wood sleepers, and strips of wood, as\r\nwell as the boards, were seriously injured by dry rot; whilst the third\r\nroom floor, which had been covered with a carpet, was perfectly sound.\r\n\r\nAt No. 79, Gracechurch Street, London, a room on the second floor was\r\ninhabited, as soon as finished, by a tenant who had kamptulicon laid\r\ndown. This floor was formed in the ordinary way, with the usual sound\r\nboarding of strips of wood, and concrete two inches thick filled in on\r\nthe same, leaving a space of about two inches under the floor boards. The\r\nfloor was seriously decayed by dry rot in a few months down to the level\r\nof the concrete pugging, below which it remained sound, and could be\r\npulled up with the hand.\r\n\r\nWe will now leave oil-cloth and kamptulicon, and try what “Keene’s\r\ncement” will do for an “air-tight” partition of a house.\r\n\r\nAt No. 16, Mark Lane, London, a partition was constructed of sound yellow\r\ndeal quarters, covered externally with “Keene’s cement, on lath, both\r\nsides.” It was removed about two years after its construction, when it\r\nwas found that the timber was completely _perished from dry rot_; so much\r\nso, that the timbers parted in the middle in places, and were for some\r\ntime afterwards moist.\r\n\r\nIt is still unfortunately the custom to keep up the old absurd fashion of\r\ndisguising woods, instead of revealing their natural beauties. Instead\r\nof wasting time in perfect imitations of scarce or dear woods, it would\r\nbe much better to employ the same amount of time in fully developing the\r\nnatural characteristics of many of our native woods, now destined for\r\ndecorative purposes because they are cheap and common; although many\r\nof our very commonest woods are very beautifully grained, but their\r\nexcellences for ornamentation are lost because our decorators have not\r\nstudied the best mode of developing their beauties. Who would wish that\r\nstained deal should be painted in imitation of oak? or that the other\r\nmaterials of a less costly and inferior order should have been painted\r\nover instead of their natural faces being exposed to view? There are\r\nbeauties in all the materials used. The inferior serve to set off by\r\ncomparison the more costly, and increase their effect. The red, yellow,\r\nand white veins of the pine timber are beautiful: the shavings are like\r\nsilk ribbons, which only nature could vein after that fashion, and to\r\nimitate which would puzzle all the _tapissiers_ of the Rue Mouffetard, in\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nWhy should not light and dark woods be commonly used in combination\r\nwith each other in our joinery? Wood may be stained of various shades,\r\nfrom light to dark. The dirt or dust does not show more on stained wood\r\nthan it does on paint, and can be as easily cleaned and refreshed by\r\nperiodical coats of varnish. Those parts subjected to constant wear and\r\ntear can be protected by more durable materials, such as finger-plates,\r\n&c. Oak can be stained dark, almost black, by means of bichromate\r\nof potash diluted with water. Wash the wood over with a solution of\r\ngallic acid of any required strength, and allow it to thoroughly dry.\r\nTo complete the process, wash with a solution of iron in the form\r\nof “tincture of steel,” or a decoction of vinegar and iron filings,\r\nand a deep and good stain will be the result. If a positive black is\r\nrequired, wash the wood over with gallic acid and water two or three\r\ntimes, allowing it to dry between every coat; the staining with the iron\r\nsolution may be repeated. Raw linseed oil will stay the darker process at\r\nany stage.\r\n\r\nDoors made up of light deal, and varied in the staining, would look as\r\nwell as the ordinary graining. Good and well-seasoned materials would\r\nhave to be used, and the joiners’ work well fitted and constructed.\r\nMouldings of a superior character, and in some cases gilt, might be used\r\nin the panels, &c. For doors, plain oak should be used for the stiles\r\nand rails, and pollard oak for the panels. If rose-wood or satin-wood be\r\nused, the straight-grained wood is the best adapted for stiles and rails;\r\nand for mahogany doors, the lights and shades in the panels should be\r\nstronger than in the stiles and rails.\r\n\r\nDark and durable woods might be used in parts most exposed to wear and\r\ntear.\r\n\r\nTreads of stairs might be framed with oak nosings, if not at first, at\r\nleast when necessary to repair the nosings.\r\n\r\nSkirtings could be varied by using dark and hard woods for the lower part\r\nor plinth, lighter wood above, and finished with superior mouldings. It\r\nmust, however, be remembered that, contrary to the rule that holds good\r\nwith regard to most substances, the colours of the generality of woods\r\nbecome considerably _darker_ by exposure to the light; allowance would\r\ntherefore have to be made for this. All the woodwork _must_, previously\r\nto being fixed, be well seasoned.\r\n\r\nThe practice here recommended would be more expensive than the common\r\nmethod of painting, but in many cases it would be better than graining,\r\nand cheaper in the long run. Oak wainscot and Honduras mahogany doors are\r\ntwice the price of deal doors; Spanish mahogany three times the price.\r\nWhen we consider that by using the natural woods, French polished, we\r\nsave the cost of four coats of paint and graining (the customary modes),\r\nthe difference in price is very small. An extra 50_l._ laid out on a\r\n500_l._ house would give some rooms varnished and rubbed fittings,\r\nwithout paint. Would it not be worth the outlay? It may be said that\r\nspots of grease and stains would soon disfigure the bare wood; if so,\r\nthey could easily be removed by the following process: Take a quarter of\r\na pound of fuller’s earth, and a quarter of a pound of pearlash, and boil\r\nthem in a quart of soft water, and, while hot, lay the composition on the\r\ngreased parts, allowing it to remain on them for ten or twelve hours;\r\nafter which it may be washed off with fine sand and water. If a floor be\r\nmuch spotted with grease, it should be completely washed over with this\r\nmixture, and allowed to remain for twenty-four hours before it is removed.\r\n\r\nLet us consider how we paint our doors, cupboards, &c., at the present\r\ntime. For our best houses, the stiles of our doors are painted French\r\nwhite; and the panels, pink, or salmon colour! For cheaper houses, the\r\ndoors, cupboards, window linings, &c., are generally two shades of what\r\nis called “stone colour” (as if stone was always the same colour), and\r\nbadly executed into the bargain: the best rooms having the woodwork\r\ngrained in imitation of oak, or satin-wood, &c. And such imitations!\r\nMahogany and oak are now even imitated on leather and paper-hangings.\r\nWood, well and cleanly varnished, stained, or, better still, French\r\npolished, must surely look better than these daubs. But French polish is\r\nnot extensively used in England: it is confined to cabinet pieces and\r\nfurniture, except in the houses of the aristocracy. Clean, colourless\r\nvarnish ought to be more generally used to finish off our woodwork,\r\ninstead of the painting now so common. The varnish should be clean and\r\ncolourless, as the yellow colour of the ordinary varnishes greatly\r\ninterferes with the tints of the light woods.\r\n\r\nIn the Imperial Palace, at Berlin, one or two of the Emperor’s private\r\nrooms are entirely fitted up with deal fittings; doors, windows,\r\nshutters, and everything else of fir-wood. “Common deal,” if well\r\nselected, is beautiful, cheap, and pleasing.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the offices of Herr Krauss (architect to Prince and Princess\r\nLouis of Hesse), who resides at Mayence, and they are fitted up, or\r\nrather the walls and ceilings are lined, with picked pitch pine-wood,\r\nparts being carved, and the whole French polished, and the effect is much\r\nsuperior to any paint, be it “stone colour,” “salmon colour,” or even\r\n“French white.”\r\n\r\nThe reception-room, where the Emperor of Germany usually transacts\r\nbusiness with his ministers, and receives deputations, &c., as well as\r\nthe adjoining cabinets, are fitted with deal, not grained and painted,\r\nbut well French polished. The wood is, of course, carefully selected,\r\ncarefully wrought, and excellently French polished, which is the great\r\nsecret of the business. In France, it is a very common practice to polish\r\nand wax floors.\r\n\r\nThe late Sir Anthony Carlisle had the interior woodwork of his house,\r\nin Langham Place, London, varnished throughout, and the effect of the\r\nvarnished deal was very like satin-wood.\r\n\r\nAbout forty years since, Mr. J. G. Crace, when engaged on the decoration\r\nof the Duke of Hamilton’s house, in the Isle of Arran, found the woodwork\r\nof red pine so free from knots, and so well executed, that instead of\r\npainting it, he had it only varnished. It was a great success, and ten\r\nyears after looked nearly as well as when first done.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Owen Jones, whose works on colour decoration are well known,\r\nwas employed a few years since by Mr. Alfred Morrisson to decorate his\r\ntown and country houses. At the country house (Fonthill House), Mr.\r\nJones built a room for the display of Chinese egg-shell pottery, the\r\nchimneypiece and fittings being entirely of ebony, inlaid with ivory, and\r\nthe ceiling of wood, panelled and inlaid, the mouldings being black and\r\ngold. At the town house, in Carlton House Terrace, London, the woodwork\r\nof the panelling, dadoes, doors, architraves, window-shutters, and all\r\nthe rooms on the ground and first floors is inlaid, from designs by Mr.\r\nJones, with various woods of different kinds, the colours of which were\r\ncarefully selected by him, with a view to perfect harmony of colouring.\r\n\r\nA house has recently been erected (from the designs of Mr. J. W.\r\nMcLaughlin, architect) near Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, which is\r\na perfect model with regard to the amount of woodwork used. The walls\r\nof the _hall_ are finished with walnut wainscoting; the fireplace is\r\nan open one, with a walnut mantelpiece, surmounted by three statues,\r\nPeace, Plenty, and Harmony, supporting the carved wooden cornice. The\r\nElizabethan _staircase_ has carved panels of maple. The _library_ is\r\nwainscoted to the ceiling in black walnut, inlaid with ebony. The _dining\r\nroom_ is also wainscoted in the richest style in oak, with polished\r\nmahogany panels. The _floors_ are of marquetry, of different woods\r\nand patterns. The _chamber story_ is finished in oak and walnut, with\r\nmahogany in the panels. The _entire interior_ finish of the house is of\r\nhard wood, _varnished and rubbed_ in cabinet style. This is as it should\r\nbe for a gentleman’s residence.\r\n\r\nWe believe the largest house now being erected in London is from the\r\ndesigns of Mr. Knowles, jun., for Baron Albert Grant, at Kensington.\r\nWe have not seen it, but we hope it will be finished in the Cincinnati\r\nstyle, as far as regards the amount of ornamental woods used.\r\n\r\nThere is a cynical French proverb, which says, “When we cannot have what\r\nwe love, we must love what we have.” But surely this cynical proverb\r\ncannot be applied to “stone colour” paint on wood. The Japanese, however,\r\nsome years since, determined not to follow this advice, for when the\r\nEnglish Government, at Admiral Sterling’s suggestion, sent to the Tycoon\r\na very fine steam vessel, the Japanese (who abhor paint about their\r\nships) immediately commenced to scrub off the paint. According to Sir\r\nRutherford Alcock, they have been steadily engaged in scrubbing it off\r\never since the boat has come into their possession, and by dint of labour\r\nand perseverance have nearly succeeded. All the fine imitation satin-wood\r\nand the gilt work have been reduced to a very forlorn state. The Japanese\r\nnot only decline to follow advice, but they are a very difficult race\r\nof people from whom to obtain correct information. When Mr. Veitch was\r\nat Yeddo, on a visit to the Legation, in quest of botanical specimens,\r\nhe saw a pine-tree from which he desired a few seeds. “Oh,” said the\r\ninevitable yaconins, “those trees _have no seed_!”--“But there they are,”\r\nreplied the unreasonable botanist, pointing to some. “Ah, yes, true; but\r\nthey _will not grow_,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nIf we must take our fashions from royalty and the aristocracy, and if we\r\nmust go abroad for them, surely the above examples will suffice; but if\r\nwe must have paint, then the preservative solution, now being extensively\r\nused in the restoration and renovation of St. Paul’s Cathedral, under\r\nthe superintendence of Mr. F. C. Penrose, the architect to the Dean and\r\nChapter, appears to possess several good qualities. The preservative\r\nsolution, which is manufactured by the Indestructible Paint Company, is\r\nsaid to be as follows: 1st, that it is colourless and invisible; 2nd,\r\nin no way does it alter the appearance of the surface; 3rd, it prevents\r\nthe growth of vegetation; and 4th, that it resists the action of the\r\natmosphere and changes of weather, not only preventing but also arresting\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that the wood selected (if not to be painted) should\r\nbe well grown, and from a fully developed tree, where all the fibres\r\nor grain are distinctly marked. The beauty of the wood, when properly\r\ntreated, consists in the brilliant manner in which the rich, deep yellow\r\nstreaks or layers of the hard wood are developed under the hands of\r\nthe skilful polisher. These yellow veins show through the polish like\r\nclear and beautifully marked streaks of amber; and strongly reflecting\r\nthe light, they produce a very pleasing effect. The yellow, variegated,\r\nhard part of the wood forms a very excellent contrast to the delicate\r\nwhiteness of the softer parts of the board; and, if skilfully selected,\r\nthe effect will be much admired, and certainly preferred to the best\r\nimitation of the more rare and expensive woods. In arranging doors,\r\npanels, &c., much will, of course, depend in selecting the wood, in\r\nplacing the best parts in the panels, so that when polished the most\r\npleasing effects will be produced. Much, too, depends on skilful\r\nworkmanship and smooth finish, which can only be obtained by care, and\r\nusing well-seasoned wood; but this is the case with all species of wood.\r\n\r\nShould any young architect, after reading the preceding remarks, be\r\ndesirous of employing natural woods in his building works, we advise\r\nhim, before he attempts this kind of colour decoration, to study Mr.\r\nOwen Jones’ lecture on “Colour in the Decorative Arts,” delivered before\r\nthe Society of Arts, 1852; and likewise M. Chevreul’s ‘Laws of the\r\nSimultaneous Contrast of Colours’; we also recommend him to--\r\n\r\n    Use _moderate_ things elegantly, and _elegant_ things moderately.\r\n\r\nOak, walnut, maple, elm, and some other woods become of very dark colour,\r\nbut can be made to receive a fine polish, and could often be employed for\r\npanels with good effect. In some cases there is great contrast of tint\r\nin the same log after preparation, so that these might be inapplicable\r\nexcept in smaller pieces, or perhaps by applying the process after\r\nthe work has been made; but sycamore, beech, and some other woods are\r\ngenerally uniform, except as regards the previous grain of the wood.\r\n\r\nAs to the matter of showing the end of the grain, according to the Gothic\r\nprinciple the beauty of a wood consists in showing the end of the grain;\r\nbut, at the same time, the classic principle is that there is a greater\r\nbeauty in the side way of the grain than in the end way.\r\n\r\nAlthough varnish and polish both form a glazing, and give a lustre to the\r\nwood they cover, as well as heighten the colours of the wood, yet from\r\ntheir want of consistence they are liable to yield to any shrinking or\r\nswelling, rising in scales or cracking, when much knocked about. Waxing,\r\non the contrary, resists percussion, but it does not possess in the same\r\ndegree as varnish the property of giving lustre to the bodies on which it\r\nis applied; any accidents, however, to its polish are easily repaired by\r\nrubbing.\r\n\r\nThe woodwork of the Swiss Cottage, at the late Colosseum, London, in the\r\nRegent’s Park, was only varnished.\r\n\r\nIn using stain on any description of wood, the stain should always be\r\nallowed to get quite dry before sizing, as that gives it a fair chance of\r\nstriking into the wood. Glue size is the best for stained work, made so\r\nthin that there is no fear of putting it on in patches. After the size is\r\nquite dry also, varnish; and if the first coat does not stand out quite\r\nsufficiently to please the eye, give it a second coat. Some persons use\r\nstain and varnish together, doing away with size; but this is a very\r\npoor method, for should the wood get scratched or damaged in any way,\r\nthe varnish and stain come off together, leaving a white place, if it be\r\nwhite wood that is stained. A painter who has been in the trade forty\r\nyears, recently remarked to us, “You must size, or else the varnish won’t\r\ncome out; it won’t show that it _is_ varnish; the wood soaks it up; while\r\nthere is any suction going on the varnish’ll go in. The sizing stops all\r\nsuction.”\r\n\r\nA great many experiments and attempts have been made at different times\r\nto colour wood. John of Verona first conceived the idea. The celebrated\r\nB. Pallissy investigated the cause of the veins, &c., in wood, and tried\r\nmordant solutions applied to the surface, wetting the surface with\r\ncertain acids, immersing the wood in water to bring out the veinage, &c.\r\n\r\nEbony has often been imitated by penetrating sycamore, plane, and lime\r\nwoods to a certain depth with pyrolignite of iron, gall-nuts, &c.\r\n\r\nWerner, in 1812, obtained great success at Dijon in colouring the woods\r\nby filtration. Marloye, in 1833, constructed a machine to colour wood\r\nby placing it erect in a cylinder, sucking out the air at one end, and\r\nforcing up the colouring solution through the other. He gave the credit\r\nof this to Bréant. Marloye has manufactured many mathematical instruments\r\nof wood coloured in this way, _which does not warp_.\r\n\r\nIf we could afford the space, we would willingly give a _résumé_ of the\r\nattempts of well known experimentalists to colour wood. We can only give\r\nthe year and name in each case:\r\n\r\n    1709. Magnol.\r\n    1733. La Baisse.\r\n    1735. Hales.\r\n    1735. Buffon.\r\n    1754. Bonnet.\r\n    1758. Du Hamel.\r\n    1804. Saussure.\r\n\r\nDuring the recent war between France and Germany, the latter country\r\nadvanced matters, their supplies of coloured woods from France being gone.\r\n\r\nAs we have made so many remarks against painting wood, it is only right\r\nthat we should give some description of it, which we will now do.\r\n\r\nHouse painting, according to Mr. W. Papworth, in his lecture on “Fir,\r\nDeal, and House Painting,” 1857, did not come into _general_ use until\r\nabout the period of William and Mary, and Anne, up to which time either\r\ncolouring by distemper or by whitewash had been in vogue for plaster\r\nwork, leaving inside woodwork more or less untouched.\r\n\r\nWe think, without wishing to think _too loud_, that house painting was\r\ninvented by _a bad builder_, in the seventeenth century, because\r\n\r\n    Putty and paint cover a multitude of sins.\r\n\r\nThe process of graining and marbling may be traced back as far at least\r\nas the time of James III. of Scotland (1567-1603), during whose reign a\r\nroom of Hopetown Tower was painted in imitation of marble. Before that\r\nperiod, imitations were done in “stone” colour, “marble” colour, wainscot\r\ncolour, &c. In 1676, marbling was executed as well as imitations of olive\r\nand walnut woods; and in 1688 tortoise-shell was copied on battens and\r\nmouldings. Mahogany was imitated in 1815, and maple wood in 1817. But why\r\nimitate mahogany, when the grain of the wood differs so much in texture,\r\nand in the appearance of the different and beautiful shades, technically\r\ntermed _roe_, _broken roe_, _bold roe_, _mottle_, _faint mottle_, and\r\n_dapple_.\r\n\r\nThe following description will give the reader some idea of ordinary\r\npainting. The woodwork having been prepared for fixing, has first to\r\nundergo the process of “knotting,” in order to prevent the turpentine\r\nin the knots of fir-wood from passing through the several coats of\r\npaint. One method for best work is to cut out the knot whilst the work\r\nis at the bench to a slight depth, and to fill up the hole with a stiff\r\nputty made of white lead, japan, and turpentine. There are many ways\r\nof killing the knots: the best and surest is to cover them with gold\r\nor silver leaf. Sometimes a lump of fresh slaked lime is laid on for\r\nabout twenty-four hours, then scraped off, a coating of “size knotting”\r\napplied, and if not sufficiently killed, they are coated with red and\r\nwhite lead in linseed oil, and rubbed down when dry. The general method\r\nis to cover the parts with size knotting, which is a preparation of\r\nred lead, white lead, and whitening, made into a thin paste with size.\r\nThe most common mode is to paint them with red ochre, which is worth\r\nnothing. The next process is that of priming, which consists in giving\r\na coat of white and red lead, and a little dryers in linseed oil. This\r\nis the first coat, and upon which the look of the paint on completion\r\ndepends. This first, or priming coat, is put on before “stopping” the\r\nwork, should that process be required. It consists in filling up with\r\nputty any cracks or other imperfections on the surface of the wood.\r\nIf the putty used in the process of stopping be introduced before the\r\nfirst coat of colour is laid on, it becomes loose when dry. After this\r\nfirst coat, pumicing is resorted to for removing all irregularities from\r\nthe surface. It is worth recollecting that _old_ white lead is much\r\nsuperior to new for all painting operations. A smooth surface being\r\nthus obtained, the second coat is given, consisting of white lead and\r\noil: about one-fourth part of turpentine is sometimes added for quick\r\nwork. If four coats are to be laid on, this second one has sometimes a\r\nproportion of red lead, amounting to a flesh colour; but if only three,\r\nit is generally made to assume the tint of the finishing coat. It should\r\nhave a good body, and be laid even. This coat, when thoroughly dry and\r\nhard, is, in best work, rubbed down with fine sand paper, and then the\r\nthird coat, or “ground colour,” applied of a somewhat darker tint than\r\nwanted when finished, having sufficient oil for easy working, but not\r\ntoo fluid: thus two-thirds oil, and one-third turpentine. The “flatting”\r\ncoat follows, the object of which is to prevent the gloss or glaze of\r\nthe oil, and to obtain a flat, dead appearance. White lead is mixed with\r\nturpentine, to which a little copal is sometimes added, and when the tint\r\nis put in it is always made lighter than the ground colour, or it would,\r\nwhen finished, appear in a series of shades and stripes. Flatting must be\r\nexecuted quickly, and the brush is generally, if not always, carried up\r\nthe work, and not across it.\r\n\r\nTo clean paint, raw alkalies should not be used, as they will infallibly\r\ntake off the flatting coat. The best mode of cleaning is by means of\r\ngood soap, not too strong, laid on with a large brush, so as to make a\r\nlather: this should be washed off clean with a sponge, and wiped dry with\r\na leather.\r\n\r\nWe must draw to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nOne cause of the decay of modern buildings, and frequent cases of\r\ndry rot, is owing to the employment of bad builders. We advise the\r\nnon-professional reader to employ an architect or surveyor when he\r\ndesires to speculate in bricks and mortar: it is the cheapest course. If\r\nhe doubts the truth of what we have written, we can assure him he will be\r\na mere child in the hands of a bad or scamping builder; that is to say,\r\nhe will obtain a badly-erected house,--a cheap contract, and a long bill\r\nof extras.\r\n\r\nThere are _seven_ classes of bad builders--1st, the _bad builder_ who\r\ndoes not know his business; 2nd, the _bad builder_ who has no money to\r\ncarry it on with; 3rd, the _partial_ scamp; 4th, the _regular_ scamp;\r\n5th, the _thorough_ scamp; 6th, the “_jerry_” builder; and 7th, the\r\n_vagabond_. There is an instance of the latter class given by Mr. Menzies\r\nin his fine work on ‘Windsor Park,’ 1864. We could give examples of all\r\nthese classes, and draw the line between each class, impossible as it may\r\nseem: they are always looking out for customers, _without architects_.\r\n\r\nWe could assist the non-professional reader by quoting the advice\r\ngiven by several architects (viz. Sir C. Wren, C. Barry, B. Smirke, W.\r\nChambers, and W. Tite) relative to buildings, but there is a Danish\r\nproverb which, translated into English, runs as follows: “He who builds\r\naccording to every man’s advice will have a crooked house.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nON THE PRESERVATION OF WOODEN BRIDGES, JETTIES, PILES, HARBOUR WORKS,\r\nETC., FROM THE RAVAGES OF THE TEREDO NAVALIS AND OTHER SEA-WORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        “Perforated sore\r\n    And drilled in holes, the solid oak is found\r\n    By worms voracious, eaten through and through.”\r\n\r\n                                              SIR JOHN BARROW.\r\n\r\nAs the destruction of timber by fungi has been called the _vegetable_\r\nrot, it may not be inappropriate to term the destruction of wood by\r\nvarious worms and insects, the _animal_ rot.\r\n\r\nWe have _four natural enemies_ to deal with: 1st, the _dry rot_, that\r\nattacks our houses, &c.; 2nd, the _worms_, or boring animals, which\r\ndestroy our ships and harbours; 3rd, the _rust_, that eats our iron; and\r\n4th, the _moisture and gases_, that destroy our stone.\r\n\r\nThere are three classes of destructive insects which prey upon\r\ntimber trees, founded upon the manner in which they carry on their\r\noperations--viz. those which feed upon the leaves and tender shoots;\r\nthose which feed upon the bark and the albumen; and those which feed upon\r\nthe heart-wood.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that some of the insects which feed upon the heart\r\nof wood do not cease their ravages upon the removal of the tree; but\r\nthat, on the contrary, the _Cossus syrex_, of our indigenous fauna, and\r\nthe larvæ of the _Callidium bajutum_, which are often found in imported\r\ntimber, continue to devour the wood long after it has been inserted in\r\nbuildings. There seem to be very few means of defence against this class\r\nof destructive agents; and very few trustworthy indications of their\r\nexistence, or of the extent of the ravages they have committed, are to\r\nbe discovered externally; and it thus frequently happens that a sound,\r\nhearty-looking stick of timber may be so seriously bored by these insects\r\nas to be of comparatively little value for building purposes of any\r\ndescription. The soft and tender woods, and such as are of a saccharine\r\nnature in their juices, are the most liable to be assailed by worms;\r\nthose which are bitter are generally, if not invariably, exempt; it is\r\nobvious, therefore, that those palatable juices, which are so conducive\r\nto their production and propagation, should be got rid of by thorough\r\nseasoning, and, if further precaution be necessary, that the infusion of\r\nsome bitter decoction into the pores of the wood will be an effectual\r\npreventive; and for which those woods that are of a regular grain afford\r\nsufficient facilities. Ash, if felled when abounding in sap, is very\r\nsubject to worms; beech, under similar circumstances, is also liable to\r\ntheir attacks; likewise alder and birch; in these woods water seasoning\r\nis sometimes found to be a good preventive; the sapwood of oak is also\r\nthus improved; the silver fir is subject to them; the sycamore is rather\r\nso; alder is said when dry to be very susceptible of engendering them;\r\nthe cedar, walnut, plane, cypress, and mahogany are examples of woods\r\nwhich discourage their advances. It has been stated that Robert Stevenson\r\n(not the son of the “Father of Railways”), of Edinburgh, at Bell Rock\r\nLighthouse (of which he was engineer), between 1814 and 1843, found that\r\ngreenheart wood, beef wood, and bullet tree were not perforated by the\r\n_Teredo navalis_, and teak but slightly so. Later experiments show that\r\nthe “jarrah” of the East, also, is not attacked. Lignum vitæ is said to\r\nbe exempt. The cost of these woods prevents their general use.\r\n\r\nIn 1810, Stevenson first noticed the _teredo_ in piles, and specimens\r\nof the creatures in wood were sent to Dr. Leach, of the British Museum,\r\nin 1811, who examined them, and noticed their peculiarities. Stevenson,\r\nsettled on Bell Rock during many years (like a new Robinson Crusoe), was\r\nenabled to watch the injuries done to the piles by the _teredo_. With\r\npiles which had been subjected to Kyan’s process before immersion, the\r\nwood was attacked at the end of the twenty-eighth month, and was entirely\r\ndestroyed in the seventh month of the fifth year. With Payne’s, it lasted\r\na year longer.\r\n\r\nWe can give the names of those who have given much time and attention\r\nto this subject. At the bottom of this page a list of works of\r\nreference[16] will be found useful. Messrs. Stevenson (engineer of Bell\r\nRock Lighthouse), Harting (Member of the Academy of Sciences of the\r\nPays-Bas), de Quatrafages, Deshayes, Caillaut, Hancock, Dagneau, de\r\nGemini, Kater, Crepin (Engineer-in-Chief, of Belgium), and A. Forestier\r\n(Engineer-in-Chief of the Bridges, &c., of France).\r\n\r\nThe termite, or white ant, is the most destructive insect to timber on\r\nland, whilst the teredo reigns supreme of sea worms in the sea. The\r\nformer we shall treat of in our next chapter, the latter we propose\r\nconsidering at some length in this.\r\n\r\nThe marine worm, of which there are accounts in all parts of the world,\r\nhas been known, by its effects, for hundreds of years; indeed, Ovid spoke\r\nof it nineteen hundred years ago, and it is even mentioned by Homer.\r\nFossil _terredines_ of great antiquity have been found near Southend;\r\nalso pieces of petrified wood from the greensand, near Lyme and Sidmouth,\r\nbored by ancient species of _teredo_; also from Bath, and from Doulting,\r\nnear Shepton Mallet, specimens of oolite, with petrified corallines in\r\nit, pierced by boring shells.\r\n\r\nIt is said that this worm is a native of India, and that it was\r\nintroduced to Holland some 200 years ago, from whence it has spread\r\nthrough the ports of northern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe _Teredo navalis_[17] is very destructive to harbour works and piling.\r\nThe Southampton water is particularly infested with it; in fact, the\r\n_teredo_ is found in every port to which coals are carried south of the\r\nTees; in the Thames, as high up as Gravesend; and northward as far as\r\nWhitby. It is also found at Ryde, Brighton, and Dover. Traces of the\r\nravages of the _Teredo navalis_, and of the _Limnoria terebrans_, have\r\nat various periods been found from the north of Scotland and Ireland, on\r\nalmost every coast, to the Cape of Good Hope and Van Dieman’s Land, in\r\nthe eastern hemisphere; and, in the western hemisphere, from the river\r\nSt. Lawrence to Staten Island, near Terra del Fuego, almost in the Polar\r\nSea; so that although this maritime scourge is rifest in warm climates,\r\nyet cold latitudes are not exempt from it.\r\n\r\nAt the Crystal Palace, Sydenham, may be seen the destructive _Teredo\r\nnavalis_ in a bottle, and there may also be seen mahogany perforated by\r\nit, and fir piles from Lowestoft Harbour, which were rendered useless by\r\nthe ravages of the worm and the _limnoria_ three years after they were\r\ndriven, showing the necessity of defending timber intended for marine\r\nconstruction. A specimen of American oak from the dock gates of Lowestoft\r\nHarbour, which had been four years under water, and a part of a fir-pile\r\nfrom the dockyard creek at Sevastopol, also show the destructive powers\r\nof the _teredo_. At the South Kensington and British Museums, London,\r\nspecimens of this worm may also be seen, as well as pieces of timber\r\nperforated by it.\r\n\r\nThe bottoms of ships, and timbers exposed to the action of the sea, are\r\noften destroyed by the _teredo_.\r\n\r\nThe gunboats constructed during the Crimean war suffered far more from\r\ndry rot and the _teredo_ than the shot and shell of the Russians. One\r\ncannot even guess at the mischief perpetrated every year all along our\r\nshores, in docks and harbours, by the boring animals that penetrate all\r\nwoods not specially protected. We cannot count the number of the ships\r\nthat have foundered at sea, owing to those few inches of timber, on which\r\nall depended, being pierced or destroyed by the worm or fungus.\r\n\r\nIn the short space of twelve years these destructive worms were known\r\nto make such havoc in the fir piles of a bridge at Teignmouth, that the\r\nwhole bridge fell suddenly, and had to be totally reconstructed.\r\n\r\nThe wooden piers of Bridlington were nearly wholly destroyed by worms;\r\nand the pile fenders on the stone piers at Scarborough were generally cut\r\nthrough in a few years.\r\n\r\nAt Dunkirk, wooden jetties are so speedily eaten away that they require\r\nrenewal every twelve or fifteen years. At Havre, a stockade was entirely\r\ndestroyed in six months. At Lorient, wood only lasts about three years\r\nin the sea-water; and at Aix, the hull of a stranded vessel was found\r\nto have lost half its weight in six months, from the ravages of these\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe reason why Balaclava, in Russia, is not a place of considerable\r\nmercantile importance is owing in a great measure to the destructive\r\nravages of the worms with which its waters are infested, and by which the\r\nhulls of ships remaining there for any length of time become perforated.\r\n\r\nThe piles of the jetties in Colombo Harbour, Ceylon, which are mostly\r\nof satin-wood, and about 14 inches in diameter, are so pierced by these\r\nworms in the course of twelve months as to require renewal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Portion of pile, from Balaclava harbour, Russia; riddled\r\nby the Teredo Navalis._]\r\n\r\nThe cofferdam at Sheerness was destroyed by the _teredo_. After a time,\r\nit was no uncommon occurrence to see several piles, apparently sound,\r\nfloated away at each tide; indeed, they were so thoroughly perforated by\r\nthe _teredo_ that in still weather, by putting the ear to the side of the\r\npile, the worms could be heard at their boring labours.\r\n\r\nThe almost total destruction of the pier-head of the old Southend Pier\r\nin a few years, is another instance of the serious damages these worms\r\ncause. The old pier-head was erected in the year 1833, and in three years\r\nthe majority of the wooden piles had been almost destroyed, and at the\r\nend of ten years, in addition to the piles being all eaten through by\r\nthe worms, the whole structure had sunk 9 inches at the western end, so\r\nthat in a short time it would have fallen. The materials with which the\r\nwork was constructed were of good quality, the fir being Memel, and the\r\noak of English growth; it was all perfectly sound in those places were\r\nthe _teredo_ had not attacked it, and indeed portions of it were again\r\nused in the construction of the extension of the pier. The whole of the\r\ntimber work was well coated with pitch and tar previously to being fixed,\r\nbut notwithstanding these precautions, and an apparent determination\r\nto protect the pier-head by copper sheathing, brushing, cleaning, and\r\nconstant watchfulness, the _teredo_ made its appearance, and committed\r\nsuch ravages that the entire destruction of the pier-head soon appeared\r\ninevitable. The _Teredo navalis_ first showed itself six months after the\r\ncompletion of the work, and was reported within twelve months to have\r\nseriously injured the piles above the copper, whilst at about low-water\r\nmark, of neap tides, nearly all the piles exhibited appearances of\r\ndestruction, the _limnoria_, as well as the _teredo_, having seriously\r\nattacked them; and in less than four years from the completion of the\r\npier-head, they had progressed in their work to such an extent that\r\nsome of the piles were entirely eaten through, both above and below the\r\ncopper sheathing; in consequence of this the stability of the structure\r\nwas materially injured, and, on examination, it was discovered that\r\nthe ground had been considerably washed away by the action of the sea,\r\nand that the piles below the copper were exposed to the action of the\r\n_teredo_.\r\n\r\nThe first appearances of the _Teredo navalis_ are somewhat singular,\r\ninasmuch as the wood which has been perforated by it presents to the\r\ncasual observer no symptom of destruction on the surface, nor are the\r\nanimals themselves visible, until the outer part of the wood has been\r\nbroken away, when their shelly habitations come in sight, and show the\r\nperfect honeycomb they have formed; on a closer examination of the wood,\r\nhowever, a number of minute perforations are discovered on the surface,\r\ngenerally covered with a slimy matter; and on opening the wood at one of\r\nthese, and tracing it, the tail of the animal is immediately found, and\r\nafter various windings and turnings, the head is discovered, which, in\r\nsome cases, is as much as 3 feet from the point of entrance; sometimes\r\nit will happen, especially if the wood has been much eaten, that their\r\nshelly tubes are partly visible on the surface, but this is rare; they\r\nenter at the surface, and bore in every direction, both with and against\r\nthe grain of the wood, growing in size as they proceed.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. W. Wood writes, in 1863: “I have now before me a portion of\r\nthe pier at Yarmouth, which is so honeycombed by this terrible creature\r\nthat it can be crushed between the hands as if it were paper, and in\r\nmany places the wood is not thicker than ordinary foolscap. This piece\r\nwas broken off by a steamer which accidentally ran against it; and\r\nso completely is it tunnelled, that although it measures 7 inches in\r\nlength and about 11 in circumference, its weight is under 4 ounces, a\r\nconsiderable portion of even that weight being due to the shelly tubes of\r\nthe destroyers.”\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the _teredo_ affix themselves to the wood they are washed\r\nagainst, are then hatched, and the worm commences boring; each individual\r\nserves by itself for the propagation of the species; and they rarely\r\ninjure each other’s habitations. Any timber, constantly under water,\r\nbut not exposed to the action of the air at the fall of the tide, is\r\nextremely likely to be destroyed by them. They appear to enter the wood\r\nobliquely, to take the grain of the fibre, and more generally to bore\r\nwith it downwards, where the perforations are left dry at low water.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated by some authorities that the _teredo_ is only a\r\ndestructive creature, and seeks the wood as a shelter, from instinctive\r\ndread of some larger animals, but there is no doubt this insect feeds\r\nupon wood. Mr. John Paton, C.E. (to whom we are indebted for much\r\ninformation on these worms), in conjunction with Mr. Newport, the eminent\r\nphysiologist and anatomist, on carefully dissecting this animal for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining its general character, and more particularly the\r\nnature of its food, found digested portions of wood in its body, so\r\nthat there is no doubt that the _teredo_ does feed upon the particles of\r\nthe wood, and to this its rapid and extraordinary growth must be mainly\r\nattributed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Lyceris, which destroys the Teredo Navalis._\r\n\r\n_The Teredo Navalis, which destroys wood._\r\n\r\n_Portion of Timber pile destroyed by Sea Worms._]\r\n\r\nThe _Teredo navalis_, or, as it is sometimes called, the Ship Worm, is\r\none of the _Acephalous mollusca_, order Conchifera, and of the family\r\nof the _Pholadariæ_. It is of an elongated vermiform shape, the large\r\nanterior part of which constitutes the boring apparatus, and contains\r\nthe organs of digestion, and the posterior, gradually diminishing in\r\nsize, those of respiration. The body is covered with a transparent\r\nskin, through which the motion of the intestines and other remarkable\r\npeculiarities are plainly visible. The posterior or tail portion is\r\narmed at its extremity, with two shells, and has projecting from it a\r\npair of tubular organs, through which the water enters, for the purpose\r\nof respiration; this portion is always in the direction of the surface,\r\nand apparently in immediate contact with the water, but does not bore.\r\nThe anterior portion of the animal is that by which it penetrates the\r\nwood, being well armed for the purpose by having, on each side, a pair of\r\nstrong valves, formed of two pieces, perfectly distinct from one another;\r\nthe larger piece protects the sides and surface of the extremities, and\r\nhas a shelly structure projecting from the interior, to which the muscles\r\nare attached; the smaller piece is more convex, and covers that part\r\nwhich should be regarded as the anterior surface of boring. This portion\r\nof the shell is deeply carniated, and seems to constitute the boring\r\napparatus. The shells form an envelop around the external tegument of\r\nthe animal, which even surrounds the foot, or part by which it adheres\r\nto the wood. The neck is provided with powerful muscles. The manner in\r\nwhich it appears to perforate the wood is by a rotary motion of the foot,\r\ncarrying round the shells, and thus making those parts act as an auger,\r\nwhich is kept, or retained in connection with the wood, by the strong\r\nadherence of the foot. The particles of wood removed by this continued\r\naction of the foot, and the valves, are engorged by the animal, for\r\nbetween the junction of the two large shells there is a longitudinal\r\nfissure in the foot, which appears to be formed by a fold of this portion\r\nof the two sides, thus forming a canal to the oral orifice, and along\r\nwhich the particles of wood bored out, are conveyed to the mouth. The\r\nmouth, or entrance to the digestive organs, is of a funnel shape, and\r\nconsists of a soft, or membraneous surface, capable of being enlarged,\r\nand leading into an œsophagus, which passes backwards towards the dorsal\r\nsurface of the animal. At or near the termination of the œsophagus, there\r\nis a glandular organ, the use of which is possibly to secrete a fluid for\r\nassisting in the digestion of the wood, and not, as has been supposed, to\r\nact as a solvent; for if such were the case, it would most probably be\r\nsituated at its commencement instead of at its termination. At a short\r\ndistance behind this organ are two other large glandular bodies, the\r\nuse of which may also be to secrete fluid for the purpose of digestion.\r\nThe œsophagus terminates in a large dilatation, into which these organs\r\npour their contents; at its posterior end the canal is dilated into a\r\nvery large elongated sac, which extends backwards to about one-fourth\r\nof the length of the whole animal, and is filled with food, while from\r\nits anterior, or upper surface, it has an oval, muscular formation, from\r\nwhich the alimentary canal is continued forwards, and, after making a few\r\nturns, passes backwards, in an almost direct line, on the upper surface\r\nof the large sac, again passing backwards and forwards, until it finally\r\narrives at its termination, which it passes round, and then proceeds, in\r\na direct line, to the anal outlet. In the lower portion of the œsophagus,\r\nand also in the sac, distinct portions of woody fibre of an extremely\r\nminute character were found by the aid of the microscope of a power of\r\nthree hundred, and this was the character of the whole of the contents of\r\nthe alimentary canal.\r\n\r\nThe _teredo_ lines the passage in the wood with a hard shell; this shell\r\nis formed around, but does not adhere to the body; it is secreted by the\r\nexternal covering, which, in its first formation, is extremely fragile,\r\nbut becomes hardened by contact with the water, and adheres to the wood,\r\nfrom which it may, however, be easily detached. The interior of this\r\nshell is not filled by the body of the _teredo_, but a large space around\r\nit is occupied with water, admitted through the small orifice in the\r\nsurface of the wood through which the animal first entered; the water\r\nbeing drawn through the respiratory tubes, into the bronchial cavity\r\nof the body, is expired again through the same orifice, and this, in\r\nconjunction with the valve-like shells attached at this part, induces a\r\ncurrent round the animal which removes the excreted fœtal matter. The\r\nshells are very smooth on the inner surface, but are somewhat rougher\r\non the exterior; they are much harder and firmer in the cells of the\r\nolder animals than in the young ones, and are composed of several annular\r\nparts, differing greatly in their length.\r\n\r\nIt is no less curious than wonderful to observe the mysterious instinct\r\nwhich apparently regulates the mechanical skill of the _teredo_, its\r\nown body supplying it with an implement of such admirable consistency\r\nand adaptation as to enable it to excavate a habitation for itself, so\r\naccurately formed that to a casual observer it would appear a mystery how\r\nso perfect a circle could be produced. It is only on examination that the\r\nraised and hollow parts of the wood become visible, and explain, in some\r\ndegree, the auger-shaped contrivance that has been used for the purpose\r\nof perforating.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated, that the wood is perforated by a rotary\r\nmotion of the foot, the adhering part of which acts as a fulcrum,\r\ncarrying round the shells, and thus giving immense power to the animal in\r\nits operations.\r\n\r\nIt is said that when Brunei was considering how to construct the Thames\r\nTunnel, he was one day “passing through the dockyard (at Chatham, where\r\nhe was employed by Government), when his attention was attracted to an\r\nold piece of ship-timber which had been perforated by that well-known\r\ndestroyer of timber--the _Teredo navalis_. He examined the perforations,\r\nand subsequently the animal. He found it armed with a pair of strong\r\nshelly valves, which enveloped its anterior integuments; and that, with\r\nits foot as a fulcrum, a rotatory motion was given by powerful muscles to\r\nthe valves, which, acting on the wood like an auger, penetrated gradually\r\nbut surely; and that, as the particles were removed, they were passed\r\nthrough a longitudinal fissure in the foot, which formed a canal to\r\nthe mouth, and so were engorged. To imitate the action of this animal\r\nbecame Brunei’s study. ‘From these ideas,’ said he, ‘by slow and certain\r\nmethods; which, when compared with the progress of works of art, will be\r\nfound to be much more expeditious in the end.’”[18]\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen suggests that the power of the _teredo_ to bore into wood\r\ndepends on muscular friction, the muscular substance being perpetually\r\nrenewed while the wood wastes away, of course, without renewal. Professor\r\nForbes, Dr. Carpenter, and Dr. Lyon Playfair were appointed about\r\ntwenty-five years ago by the British Association to examine into the\r\nnatural history and habits of these boring animals, but they did not\r\narrive at any definite conclusion as to whether the boring action of the\r\n_teredo_ was mechanical or chemical. Dr. Deshayes, on his return from\r\nAlgiers, after making accurate drawings and careful investigations, came\r\nto the conclusion that the borings were effected by an acid secretion.\r\nMr. Thomson, of Belfast, examined the operations of the _teredo_ on the\r\npier at Port Patrick, and arrived at the same conclusion. The general\r\nopinion, however, is that the boring action is a mechanical one.\r\n\r\nAlthough the _teredo_ appears to penetrate all kinds of timber, that\r\nwhich it seems to destroy with the greatest ease is fir, in which it\r\nworks much more speedily and successfully than in any other, and perhaps\r\ngrows to the greatest size. In a fir pile, taken from the old pier-head\r\nat Southend, a worm was found 2 feet long and ¾ inch in diameter, and\r\nindeed they have been heard of 3 feet in length and 1 inch in diameter.\r\nThe soft, porous nature of the wood is no doubt the cause of their rapid\r\ngrowth, for in oak timber they do not progress so fast, or grow to so\r\ngreat a length, though in Sir Hans Sloane’s ‘History of Jamaica’ (1725)\r\nthere are accounts of these animals destroying keels of ships made of\r\noak, and even of cedar, although the latter is renowned, by its smell and\r\nresin, for resisting all kinds of worms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Shell left by the Teredo Navalis._\r\n\r\n_Cell formed by the Teredo Navalis showing method of boring._]\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of worm which is very destructive to timber,\r\nwhich Smeaton observed in Bridlington piers. This is the TIMBER-BORING\r\nSHRIMP, or GRIBBLE, the _Limnoria terebrans_ (or _Limnoria perforata_,\r\nLeach), a mollusc of the family _Asselotes_, Leach. The _Limnoria\r\nterebrans_ is very abundant around the British shores. Its ravages were\r\nfirst particularly observed in the year 1810, by the late Sir. Robert\r\nStevenson, engineer of the Bell Rock Lighthouse. While engaged in the\r\nerection of that structure he found the timber of the temporary erections\r\nto be soon destroyed by the attacks of the _limnoria_. So little was\r\nknown of the _limnoria_ at the time that Dr. Leach, a well-known\r\nnaturalist, who received some specimens from Mr. Stevenson, in 1811,\r\ndeclared it to be a new and highly interesting species. In 1834, the\r\nlate Dr. John Coldstream wrote a very full and interesting description\r\nof the creature. The _limnoria_ resembles a woodlouse, and is so small\r\nas hardly to be perceptible in the timber it attacks, being almost of\r\nthe same colour. Small as is this crustacean, hardly larger indeed than\r\na grain of rice, it is a sad pest wherever submarine timber is employed,\r\nfor it works with great energy, and its vast numbers quite compensate\r\nfor the small size of each individual; for as many as twenty thousand\r\nwill appear on the surface of a piece of a pile only 12 inches square. It\r\nproceeds in a very methodical manner, and makes its way obliquely inward,\r\nunless it happens to meet a knot, when it passes round the obstacle and\r\nresumes its former direction. The surface of the timber being first\r\nattacked, it proceeds progressively into the wood to the depth of about\r\n1½ inch: the tunnels being cylindrical, perfectly smooth winding holes,\r\nabout ⅟16th inch in diameter: it is necessary that the holes should\r\nbe filled with salt water. The outward crust formed by these attacks\r\nthen becomes macerated and rotten, and is gradually washed away by the\r\nbeating of the sea. The _limnoria_ does not work by means of any tool or\r\ninstrument like the _teredo_, but is supposed to possess some species\r\nof dissolvent liquor, furnished by the juices of the animal itself. Dr.\r\nColdstream was of opinion that the animal effects its work by the use of\r\nits mandibles. From ligneous matter having been found in its viscera,\r\nsome have concluded that it feeds on the wood, but since other molluscs\r\nof the same genus, _Pholas_, bore and destroy stonework, the perforation\r\nmay serve only for the animal’s dwelling. The _limnoria_ seems to prefer\r\ntender woods but the hardest do not escape: teak and greenheart are about\r\nthe only woods it does not attack. The rate at which the _limnoria_ bores\r\ninto wood in pure salt water is said to be about one inch in a year;\r\nbut instances have occurred in which the destruction has been much more\r\nrapid. At Lowestoft Harbour, square 14 inch piles were in three years\r\neaten down to 4 inches square. At Greenock, a pile 12 inches square was\r\neaten through in seven years. It is stated that a 3-inch oak plank, 12\r\nfeet long, would be entirely destroyed in about eight years. Joists\r\nof timber have been found at Southend Pier, 2 feet and 3 feet below\r\nhigh-water mark, where they had made rapid destruction. The _limnoria_\r\nalmost always works just under neap tides; it cannot live in fresh\r\nwater, and whilst it is destroying the surface of a pile, the _teredo_\r\nis attacking the interior: sometimes the former is found attacking the\r\nsame timber as the Chelura. As with most of these creatures, the male\r\n_limnoria_ is smaller than the female, being about one-third her size.\r\nThe female may be distinguished by the pouch in which the eggs and\r\nafterwards the young are carried. About six or seven young are generally\r\nfound in the pouch.\r\n\r\nThe WOOD-BORING SHRIMP (_Chelura terebrans_) is a crustacean that nearly\r\nrivals the _teredo_ itself in its destructive powers. It makes burrows\r\ninto the wood, wherein it can conceal itself, and at the same time\r\nfeast upon the fragments, as is proved by the presence of woody dust\r\nwithin its interior. Its tunnels are made in an oblique direction, not\r\nvery deeply sunk below the surface, so that after a while the action of\r\nthe waves washes away the thin shell, and leaves a number of grooves\r\non the surface. Below these, again, the creature bores a fresh set of\r\ntunnels, which in their turn are washed away, so that the timber is soon\r\ndestroyed in successive grooved flakes.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Allman, its habits can be very easily watched, as if\r\nit is merely placed in a tumbler of sea water, together with a piece of\r\nwood, it will forthwith proceed to work, and gnaw its way into the wood.\r\nThe apparatus with which it works this destruction is a kind of file or\r\nrasp, which reduces the wood into minute fragments. In this creature\r\nthe jaw feet are furnished with imperfect claws, and the tenth segment\r\nfrom the head is curiously prolonged into a large and long spine. The\r\ngreat flattened appendages near the tail seem to be merely used for the\r\npurpose of cleaning its burrow of wood dust which is not required for\r\nfood. The creature always swims on its back, and when commencing its work\r\nof destruction, clings to the wood with the legs that proceed from the\r\nthorax. The wood-boring shrimp is one of the jumpers, and, like the sand\r\nhopper, can leap to a considerable height when placed on dry land. It\r\nhas been detected in timber taken from the sea at Trieste. It was first\r\nobserved as an inhabitant of the British seas several years ago, by Mr.\r\nRobert Ball, of Dublin, and in January, 1847, it was described by Mr.\r\nMullins, C.E., in a paper read before the Institution of Civil Engineers\r\nof Ireland, as being very injurious to the timber piles in Kingstown\r\nHarbour, near Dublin, and far more destructive than the _Limnoria\r\nterebrans_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIMNORIA TEREBRANS. FEMALE. MALE.\r\n\r\nA. B. C. HEAD OF THE TEREDO NAVALIS.\r\n\r\nRASP OR FILE OF THE CHELURA. CHELURA TEREBRANS.\r\n\r\nELEVATION OF PILES, SOUTHEND PIER, DESTROYED BY THE “TEREDO” AND\r\n“LIMNORIA” ABOVE AND BELOW THE COPPER SHEATING.]\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the _lesson_ the celebrated engineer,\r\nBrunel, received from observing the _teredo_; and we can state that\r\narchitects have also received _lessons_ from nature. Sir Christopher\r\nWren constructed his spire of St. Bride’s Church, London, after observing\r\nthe construction of the delicate shell, called _Turretella_, which has\r\na central column, or newel, round which the spiral turns. Brunelleschi\r\ndesigned the dome of Sta. Maria, at Florence, after studying the bones\r\nof birds and the human form; and Michael Angelo followed Brunelleschi in\r\nconstructing the dome of St. Peter’s, Rome.[19]\r\n\r\nThe LEPISMA is also a destructive little animal, which begins to prey\r\non wood in the East Indies, as soon as it is immersed in sea water. The\r\nunprotected bottom of a boat has been known to be eaten through by it in\r\nthree or four weeks.\r\n\r\nThese worms, it must be remembered, do not live except where they have\r\nthe action of the water almost every tide, nor do they live in the parts\r\ncovered with sand. The wooden piles of embankments and sea locks suffer\r\nvery much from their depredations, and in the sea dykes of Holland they\r\ncause very expensive annual repairs.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch used to coat their piles with a mixture of pitch and tar, and\r\nthen strew small pieces of cockle and other shells, beaten almost to\r\npowder, and mixed with sea sand, which incrusted and armed the piles\r\nagainst the attacks of the _teredo_. We believe it was a frequent\r\npractice in London, about half a century ago, to place small shells in\r\nthe wooden pugging between the floor joists to deaden sound.\r\n\r\nHaving described the chief peculiarities of these worms, shown their\r\nmode of working, and the extent to which their destructive powers may be\r\ncarried, it will now be necessary to consider the various schemes which\r\nhave been proposed and tried to prevent their desolating ravages. These\r\nmay be divided into _three_ classes, viz. the natural, chemical, and\r\nmechanical.\r\n\r\n1st. By using woods which are able to resist the attacks of sea worms.\r\n\r\n2nd. By subjecting piles to a chemical process.\r\n\r\n3rd. By adopting a mechanical process.\r\n\r\nFirst. We have not any English woods which resist their attacks. Elm\r\n(used for piles in England) or beech (used for piles, if entirely under\r\nwater, in France) cannot withstand the _teredo_; while oak cannot battle\r\nsuccessfully against wood-beetles in carvings. It is therefore necessary\r\nto inquire whether foreign woods are any better.[20] Unfortunately the\r\ngreat expense of importing them into England prevents their use for piles.\r\n\r\nNearly all our foreign woods used for engineering and building purposes\r\ncome from the Baltic or Canada: they are fir and pine. Memel timber from\r\nthe Baltic is comparatively useless unless thoroughly creosoted; and\r\nCanadian timber is not so good as the Baltic wood. At Liverpool and some\r\nof the western ports of England Canadian timber is preferred to Baltic,\r\nalthough we believe the reason to be that they cannot get the latter,\r\nexcept in small quantities at a time.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of timber woods which, according to good\r\nauthorities, resist for a long period of time the attacks of sea worms.\r\nIt should be borne in mind, however, that the timber should be cut,\r\nduring the proper season, from a large and full-grown tree; and, to\r\nprevent splitting, it should be kept from the direct action of the sun\r\nwhen first cut; it should have all the bark and sapwood removed, and\r\nallowed to dry a certain time before being used.\r\n\r\n    WOODS WHICH RESIST SEA WORMS.\r\n\r\n    _Australia, Western._--Jarrah, beef-wood, tuart.\r\n\r\n    _Bahama._--Stopper-wood.\r\n\r\n    _Brazil._--Sicupira, greenheart.\r\n\r\n    _British Guiana._--Cabacalli, greenheart, kakarilly, silverballi\r\n    (yellow).\r\n\r\n    _Ceylon._--Halmalille, palmyra, theet-kha, neem.\r\n\r\n    _Demerara._--Bullet, greenheart (purple heart-wood), sabicu.\r\n\r\n    _India._--Malabar teak, sissoo, morung sál, dabu, than-kya,\r\n    ilupé, anan, angeli, may-tobek. (Teak resists the _teredo_, but\r\n    is not proof against barnacles.)\r\n\r\n    _Jamaica._--Greenheart.\r\n\r\n    _North America._--Locust.\r\n\r\n    _Sierra Leone._--African oak, or tortosa.\r\n\r\n    _South America._--Santa Maria wood.\r\n\r\n    _Philippine Islands._--Malacintud, barnabá, palma-brava.\r\n\r\n    _Tasmania._--Blue gum.\r\n\r\n    _West Indies._--Lignum vitæ.\r\n\r\nSecond. The chemical, viz. Kyan’s process of corrosive sublimate; Payne’s\r\nprocess of sulphate of iron and muriate of lime; pitching and tarring;\r\nBurnett’s process of chloride of zinc; and arsenic, or other mercurial\r\npreparations, have all failed, with the exception of Bethell’s process of\r\noil of tar. The failure must proceed from one of two causes; either that\r\nthe sea-water decomposes the poisonous ingredients contained in the wood,\r\nor that these poisonous compounds have no injurious effect on the worms;\r\nit appears, however, that both these causes have been in operation,\r\nprincipally the latter.\r\n\r\nWithout a series of the most minute experiments, it is impossible to\r\nform any general notion of the action of sea-water on timber. Common\r\nsalt, chlorides of calcium and magnesium, sulphate of soda, iodides\r\nand bromides of the same metals, are known to exist in sea-water, and\r\nin great abundance in the torrid zone. What effect these different\r\ningredients may have upon saturated timber it is difficult to say, but it\r\nis extremely probable that they do have an effect.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the different poisonous compounds having no injurious\r\neffect on the worms, it should be remembered that all cold-blooded\r\nanimals are much more tenacious of life than those of a higher\r\ntemperament, and in descending the scale of animal creation, the tenacity\r\nof life increases, and this principle is more developed. A frog, which\r\nthough cold-blooded, is an animal of a much higher order than the\r\n_teredo_, will not only live in hydrogen gas, but also in a strong\r\nsolution of hydrocyanic acid, while at the same time a single drop placed\r\non the nose of a rat, or in the eye of a rabbit, would produce instant\r\ndeath. A somewhat similar occurrence is noticed in the ‘British and\r\nForeign Medical Review,’ for July, 1841, showing the slow effects of\r\nprussic acid on the common snake and turtle.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be inferred, that as it requires a large quantity of the\r\nmost virulently poisoned matter to destroy animals of a much higher order\r\nthan the _teredo_, it would take a still greater quantity to affect those\r\nanimals as they exist in their own element.\r\n\r\nThe preserving property of soluble salts, such as corrosive sublimate,\r\nsulphate of copper, &c., was considered to be founded upon their power\r\nof coagulating the albumen, and the sap of wood, thereby rendering that\r\nsap less liable to decay; but that very quality of combining with the\r\nalbumen, destroyed the activity of the poison of the salts. A given\r\nquantity of corrosive sublimate of mercury, which if administered to a\r\ndog would kill it, would, when mixed with the white of an egg, become\r\ncoagulated, and if swallowed in that state would be perfectly harmless;\r\nso a piece of wood, saturated by those salts, could be eaten by a worm\r\nwithout injury.\r\n\r\nA French naturalist, M. de Quatrefages,[21] in 1848, suggested that a\r\nweak solution of mercury (corrosive sublimate) thrown into the water will\r\ndestroy the milt of the _teredo_, and consequently prevent fecundation\r\nof the eggs, thus exhausting the molluscs in the bud. He proposed that\r\nships should be cleared of this terrible pest by being taken into a\r\nclosed dock, into which a few handfuls of corrosive sublimate should\r\nbe thrown and well mixed with the water. He considered that about 1\r\nlb. of sublimate would be sufficient for 20,000 cubic metres (metre =\r\n39·37 English inches) of water; but on account of the cost it would\r\nbe advisable to use salts of lead or copper. This proposition of de\r\nQuatrefages reminds us of Chapman’s suggestion, in 1812, to get rid of\r\ndry rot in ships, viz. by sweeping out the hold, laying from two to four\r\ntons of copperas in her bottom, and as much fresh water let in upon it as\r\nwould make a saturated solution to soak into the wood.\r\n\r\nM. de Quatrefages placed the four salts he used in his experiments in\r\nthe following order, according to merit: 1st, corrosive sublimate; 2nd,\r\nacetate of lead; 3rd, sulphate of copper; and 4th, nitrate of copper.\r\n\r\nIn America, white oxide of zinc is used as a marine paint for ships\r\nand piles. In the United States Navy Yard at Gosport it is spoken well\r\nof, and very frequently employed. It is said to be much superior to\r\nwhite-lead, red-lead, verdigris, or coal-tar, and that timber covered\r\nwith two coats of white zinc is neither attacked by the worm, nor do\r\nbarnacles attach to it when immersed in salt water.\r\n\r\nWe can only find one instance of timber impregnated with water-glass\r\nhaving been tested against this subtle foe. Water-glass is certainly\r\nworth a further trial.\r\n\r\nThe instance we refer to occurred about forty years ago. In 1832,\r\nDr. Lewis Feuchtwanger, of New York, was permitted by the Ordnance\r\nDepartment, under the direction of Commodore Perry, to perform\r\nexperiments with water-glass on piles in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and in\r\nvarious docks. The piles in the docks were destroyed by the _teredo_ so\r\nfast that they _had to be replaced every three years_. The experiments\r\nproved highly satisfactory: the piles which had been so treated lasting\r\nmany years, without any indication of being attacked by sea-worms.\r\n\r\nThe reader is referred to some works on water-glass mentioned below,[22]\r\nwhich are worthy of attentive perusal.\r\n\r\nThird. The mechanical processes. They are few in number, and rather\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\nAt Saint Sebastian, in Spain, the piles of the wooden bridge standing\r\nin the sea have been guarded against the attacks of sea-worms in the\r\nfollowing manner: Each pile is surrounded by a wooden box, and the space\r\nbetween filled up with cement. After six years it was proved that the\r\npiles were in a perfect condition, whilst the outer boxes were completely\r\nriddled by the worms. A similar method to this was adopted, some years\r\nsince, to many of the piles in the Herne Bay Pier, which were affected\r\nby sea-worms. Several attempts had been made to protect the timber, by\r\nsaturating it under various processes, with, however, only doubtful\r\nsuccess. At last, a wooden casing was formed round each pile, leaving\r\na space of about an inch all round, which was rammed full of lime or\r\ncement concrete. That process appeared to be perfectly successful, as the\r\npier-master, who first adopted the method, stated that some of the piles\r\nhad been so treated for three or four years, and although the worms had\r\ncommenced their ravages, they appeared to have been checked, and not to\r\nhave been able to exist when so enclosed.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, Brunel suggested an easy way of defending piles, which was to\r\ngive them in the first instance a coat of tar; then powder them with\r\nbrick-dust, which would render the wood sufficiently hard to receive a\r\ncoat or two of cement. This is similar to the Dutch method.\r\n\r\nSome foreigners use sheet lead nailed on to piles, and wrapped close\r\nround with well-tarred rope.\r\n\r\nCopper sheathing has often been used for the protection of piling in\r\npiers and harbours. The destruction of copper by the action of sea-water\r\nis a matter which has long occupied the attention of scientific men, and\r\nit appears to be well ascertained that the decay does not result from the\r\nbad quality of the copper, for, according to Mr. Wilkinson, no difference\r\ncould be discovered between the composition of copper that had endured\r\nwell, and that which had been rapidly destroyed. Copper sheathing was\r\nused at Southend, but without success, for although nearly all the piles\r\nwere covered with it for about 9 feet or 10 feet, the _limnoria_ not only\r\npenetrated between the copper and the timber, but the copper had decayed\r\nto such an extent as in some cases to be no thicker than the thinnest\r\npaper; it was soft, and peeled off the wood very easily, and in two or\r\nthree years would probably have been entirely destroyed.\r\n\r\nCovering the surface of the timber with broad-headed scupper nails,\r\narranged in regular rows with their heads at no great distance from each\r\nother, is a method which has been satisfactorily employed in various\r\nparts of the world, in Swedish and Danish vessels, even up to the\r\npresent time, and, indeed, it was also practised by the Romans. The\r\nscupper-nailed piles at Southend, after twelve years’ exposure to the\r\nsea, were perfectly sound, and although the nails were not driven close\r\ntogether in the first instance, yet the corrosive action was so great as\r\nto form a solid impenetrable metallic substance, upon which the worms\r\nrefused to settle. Scupper nails have been proved at Yarmouth, as well\r\nas at other places, to have protected timber for forty years, but the\r\nprocess is expensive, as it costs one shilling per square foot. They\r\nshould be about half an inch square at the head.\r\n\r\nCaptain Sir Samuel Brown, R.N., states that from numerous experiments and\r\nobservations, he is satisfied that at present there is really no specific\r\nremedy against the attacks of sea-worms upon timber, except iron nails.\r\nHe proposes to encase the piles with broad-headed iron nails resembling\r\nscupper nails, but considerably larger, and he says that in the course of\r\na few months corrosion takes place, and spreads into the interstices. The\r\nrust hardens upon the pile, and becomes a solid mass which the worm will\r\nnot touch. Experiments tried at the Trinity Pier, Newhaven, and Brighton\r\nPier, have established the effectiveness of his method.\r\n\r\nAt the Cape of Good Hope, and many other places, wood piles are cased\r\nin iron, and occasionally iron piles are used instead of wood, at great\r\ncost. Further experience is desirable as to the durability of cast\r\niron[23] in salt water, especially as to its peculiar property of\r\nconversion, after a few years’ immersion in the sea, into a carburet of\r\niron, closely resembling plumbago, so that it may be easily cut with\r\na knife. This, of course, diminishes its powers of resistance acting\r\nupon the framing it is intended to strengthen. In the course of the\r\nconstruction of the Britannia Bridge, about one hundred thin plates\r\nwere delivered, which were not used on account of some error in their\r\ndimensions. They were left on the platform alongside the straits,\r\nexposed to the wash and spray of the sea; and after about two years were\r\nliterally so completely decomposed as to be swept away with a broom into\r\nthe water, not a particle of iron remaining.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that the chemical processes have failed with the\r\nexception of Bethell’s process of oil of tar, generally known as the\r\ncreosoting process. This method, _when properly carried out_, thoroughly\r\nprotects wood from the ravages of the _teredo_ and other marine worms.\r\nThe breakwaters and piers at Leith, Holyhead, Portland, Lowestoft, Great\r\nGrimsby, Plymouth, Wisbeach, Southampton, &c., have been built with\r\ncreosoted timber, and in no case have the _Teredo navalis_, _Limnoria\r\nterebrans_, or any other marine worms or insects been found to attack\r\nthese works, as certified to by the engineers in whose charge the several\r\nworks are placed. In the cases of Lowestoft and Southampton we are\r\nenabled to give the detailed reports.\r\n\r\nA most searching examination, lasting many days, was made in 1849, upon\r\nevery pile in Lowestoft Harbour, by direction of Mr. Bidder; and the\r\nreport of Mr. Makinson, the Superintendent of Lowestoft Harbour Works,\r\ncontains the subjoined statement:\r\n\r\n“The following is the result, after a close and minute investigation of\r\nall the piles in the North and South Piers.\r\n\r\n“_North Pier._--The whole of the creosoted piles in the North Pier, both\r\nseaward and inside the harbour, nine hundred in number, are sound, and\r\nquite free from _teredo_ and _limnoria_.\r\n\r\n“_South Pier._--The whole of the creosoted piles in the South Pier, both\r\nseaward and inside the harbour, seven hundred in number, are sound, and\r\nquite free from _teredo_ and _limnoria_.\r\n\r\n“There is no instance whatever of an uncreosoted pile being sound. They\r\nare all attacked, both by the _limnoria_ and the _teredo_, to a very\r\ngreat extent, and the piles in some instances are eaten through. All the\r\ncreosoted piles are quite sound, being neither touched by the _teredo_ or\r\nthe _limnoria_, though covered with vegetation, which generally attracts\r\nthe _teredo_.”\r\n\r\nThere was only one instance of a piece of creosoted wood, in Lowestoft\r\nHarbour, being touched by a worm, and that was occasioned by the workmen\r\nhaving cut away a great part of one of the cross heads, leaving exposed\r\nthe interior or heart of the wood, to which the creosote had not\r\npenetrated. At this spot a worm entered, and bored to the right, where\r\nit found creosote; on turning back and boring to the left, but finding\r\ncreosote all around, its progress was stopped, and it then appeared to\r\nhave left the piece of wood altogether.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Mr. Doswell, who had the conduct of experiments on different\r\ndescriptions of wood at Southampton, where the river was so full of the\r\nworm that piles of 14 inches square had been eaten down to 4 inches in\r\nfour years, reported as follows: “From my examination, last spring tides,\r\nof the specimen blocks attached, on the 22nd February, 1848, to some\r\nworm-eaten piles of the Royal Pier, I am enabled to report that Bethell’s\r\ncreosoted timbers all continue to be unaffected by the worms; that the\r\npieces saturated with Payne’s solution continue to lose in substance by\r\ntheir ravages; and that the unprepared timbers diminish very fast, except\r\nthe American elm, which stands as well (or nearly so) as that prepared by\r\n‘Payne’s solution.’”\r\n\r\nThe following are the detailed particulars:\r\n\r\nBETHELL’S CREOSOTED BLOCKS, PLACED FEBRUARY 22, 1848.\r\n\r\n    Memel, at low water of spring tides      } Unaffected by worms.\r\n    Red pine, at low water of neap tides     }\r\n    Yellow fir, at high water of neap tides    A few barnacles.\r\n\r\nPAYNIZED BLOCKS, PLACED APRIL 6, 1848.\r\n\r\n    Red pine, at low water of spring tides     Worm-eaten.\r\n    American elm, at low water of neap tides } A few barnacles.\r\n    Fir, at high water of neap tides         }\r\n\r\nUNPREPARED BLOCKS, PLACED APRIL 6, 1848.\r\n\r\n    Memel, at low water of spring tides       Much worm-eaten.\r\n    American elm, at low water of neap tides  A few barnacles.\r\n    Fir, at high water of neap tides          Much worm-eaten.\r\n\r\nOn 1st January, 1852, Mr. Doswell ascertained that, notwithstanding the\r\nnumber of _teredines_ and _limnoria_ to be found in the Southampton\r\nWaters, none of the creosoted blocks had been attacked by them.\r\n\r\nAccording to M. Forestier, similar results have been obtained at\r\nBrighton, Sunderland, and Teignmouth.\r\n\r\nAllusion has already been made to Mr. Pritchard, of Shoreham, with\r\nreference to preserving timber. On July 26, 1842, he presented a report\r\nto the Treasurer of the Brighton Suspension Chain Pier Company, upon the\r\npreservation of timber from the action of sea-worms. We give a portion of\r\nit, as follows:\r\n\r\n“Stockholm tar has been used, and proved to be of little service; this\r\ntar is objectionable owing to its high price, and also from its being\r\nmanufactured from vegetable substances. All tars containing vegetable\r\nproductions must be detrimental to the preservation of timber, especially\r\nwhen used in, and exposed to, salt water. This tar does not penetrate\r\ninto the wood, and in a very few months the salt acid of the sea will eat\r\nit all away.\r\n\r\n“Common gas or coal tar has been used to a great extent, and its effects\r\nare apparent to all. It does a very great deal of harm, forms a hard or\r\nbrittle crust or coat on the wood, and completely excludes the damp and\r\nunnatural heat from the possibility of escape, owing to its containing\r\nammonia, which burns the timber, and in a few years it turns brown\r\nand crumbles into dust. Indeed, timber prepared with this tar will be\r\ncompletely destroyed on this coast and pier by the ravages of the _Teredo\r\nnavalis_, and the _Limnoria terebrans_, in five or six years.\r\n\r\n“Also Kyan’s patent, or the bi-chloride of mercury, has been used, but\r\nhas proved equally useless. The sleepers Kyanized five years ago, and\r\nin use at the West India Dock warehouses, have been discovered to decay\r\nrapidly, and the wooden tanks at the Anti-Dry-Rot Company’s principal\r\nyard are destroyed.\r\n\r\n“I would recommend you for the future to use ‘oil of tar and pyrolignite\r\nof iron’ (Bethell’s patent). This process will, without a doubt, succeed.\r\nI have proved in hydraulic works on this coast that it will fully prevent\r\nthe decay in timber piles, destroy sea-worms, and supersede the necessity\r\nof coating the piles with iron nails. In Shoreham Harbour, for instance,\r\nthere is a piece of red pine accidentally infused with pyrolignite of\r\niron, which after being in use twelve years is perfectly sound. There is\r\nanother waleing piece, the very heart of English oak, Kyanized, and in\r\nuse only four years, which is like a honeycomb or network, completely\r\neaten away by the _teredo_ and other sea-worms. I have fully proved the\r\nefficiency of this method at different harbours and docks. Sixteen years\r\nago I had timber prepared with it, and in use on the shores of the Dee,\r\nand it is at the present moment perfectly sound. The pyrolignite of iron\r\nmust be used of very pure quality; the timber must be dry; afterwards\r\nthe oil of tar must be applied, and not on any account must it contain a\r\nparticle of ammonia. The immense destruction on the coast of timber by\r\nthe sea-worms, and the important fact that at the Chain Pier there are\r\nnot twenty of the original piles remaining at the present time, is of\r\nitself sufficient to awaken anxiety.”\r\n\r\nWith regard to the opinion of foreigners on the subject of creosoting,\r\nwe cannot do better than quote the report of the commission or committee\r\n(instituted in 1859) of the Royal Academy of Sciences, Holland, upon the\r\nmeans of preserving wood from the _teredo_, published at Haarlem in\r\n1866. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n“To conclude, it results from experiments which the committee has\r\ndirected during six consecutive years, that--\r\n\r\n“1st. Coatings of any sort whatever applied to the surface of the timber\r\nin order to cover it with an envelop upon which the young _teredo_ will\r\nnot fasten offer a very insufficient protection; such an envelop soon\r\nbecomes damaged, either by mechanical action, such as the friction of\r\nwater or ice, or by the dissolving action of water; and as soon as any\r\npoint upon the surface of the wood is uncovered, however small it be, the\r\n_teredoes_ of microscopic size penetrate into the interior of the wood.\r\n\r\n“Covering wood with plates of copper, or zinc, or flatheaded nails are\r\nexpensive processes, and only defend the wood as long as they present a\r\nperfect and unbroken surface.\r\n\r\n“2nd. Impregnation with soluble metallic salts generally considered\r\npoisonous to animals does not preserve the wood from the invasions of\r\nthe _teredo_; the failure of these salts is partly attributable to their\r\nbeing soaked out of the wood by the dissolving action of the sea-water,\r\npartly also to the fact that some of these salts do not appear to be\r\npoisonous to the _teredo_.\r\n\r\n“3rd. Although we cannot venture to say that there may not be found in\r\nthe colonies a wood that may resist the _teredo_, yet we may affirm that\r\nhardness of any timber is not an obstacle to the perforations of this\r\nmollusc. This has been proved by the ravages it has made on the Gaïac and\r\nMamberklak woods.\r\n\r\n“4th. The only means which can be confidently regarded as a preservative\r\nagainst the ravages of the _teredo_ is the creosote oil; nevertheless,\r\nin the employment of this agent great care should be taken regarding the\r\nquality of the oil, the degree of penetration, and the quality of the\r\nwood treated.”\r\n\r\nThese results of the experiments of the committee are confirmed by the\r\nexperience of a large number of engineers of ponts et chaussées (bridges\r\nand causeways) in Holland, England, France, and Belgium. For example,\r\nvery lately a Belgian engineer, M. Crepin, expressed himself as follows\r\nin his Report, dated 5th February, 1864, upon experiments made at Ostend:\r\n\r\n“The experiment now appears to us decisive, and we think we may conclude\r\nthat fir timber well prepared with creosote oil of good quality is proof\r\nagainst the _teredo_, and certain to last for a long time. Everything\r\ndepends, therefore, upon a good preparation with good creosote oil, and\r\non the use of wood capable of injection. It appears that resinous wood is\r\neasiest to impregnate, and that white fir should be rejected.”\r\n\r\nM. Forestier, the able French engineer at Napoléon-Vendée sums up as\r\nfollows the results of the experiments undertaken by him in the port of\r\nSables-d’Olonne, viz.:\r\n\r\n“These results fully confirm those obtained at Ostend, and it appears\r\nto us difficult not to admit that the experiments of Ostend and Sables\r\nd’Olonne are decisive, and prove in an incontestable manner that the\r\n_teredo_ cannot attack wood properly creosoted.”\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that there are three preservative methods, which,\r\naccording to experience, will save timber piles from the ravages of the\r\nworms, viz.: 1st. By using woods able to resist unaided their attacks.\r\n2nd. The mechanical method, which is, by covering the piles with scupper\r\nnails, &c. This process is, however, very expensive, especially as the\r\nfour sides of the pile must be covered; and, moreover, it affords no\r\nprotection to the timber from internal rot or decay. 3rd. The chemical,\r\nor “creosoting” method. This process is cheaper than the last; it\r\npreserves the wood from decay, and no worms will touch it.\r\n\r\nWhen unprepared piles are placed in the sea, there is every probability,\r\nsooner or later, of their being attacked by the _teredo_. This animal,\r\nhowever, is not left in peaceable enjoyment of the dwelling which it has\r\nconstructed, and the food which it loves, but is liable to be attacked\r\nby an enemy, an _annelide_, to which the late M. de Haan has given\r\nthe name of _Lycoris fucata_. This animal is to be found wherever the\r\n_teredo_ exists, indeed its eggs and larva are to be met with in the\r\nmidst of those of the mollusc. M. Kater has remarked that the adult\r\n_lycoris_ dwelling in the mud which it enters during winter, and into\r\nwhich the piles are driven, climbs up the pile to the hole formed by the\r\n_teredo_, where, in some manner, it sucks or eats its victim; then having\r\nenlarged the entrance to the hole, it enters and rests in the place of\r\nthe _teredo_. After a time it goes back to the entrance, and commences to\r\nseek for fresh prey.\r\n\r\nThe _lycoris_ is narrow and not very long, provided laterally with a\r\ngreat many little feet terminating in points and covered with hair, and\r\nhaving in front a pair of hard superior jaws, pointed horns, and the\r\ninferior jaws bent round in the form of hooks. Behind the head are four\r\npairs of tubuliform gills. It is with these arms that this little animal\r\npursues and devours the _teredo_.\r\n\r\nOne day M. Kater was fortunately able to observe the operations of the\r\n_lycoris_, One of these animals coming out of a hole in the wood which\r\nhe inhabited, seized upon a _teredo_, which M. Kater had previously\r\ndeposited at the bottom of the vessel containing the wood. He saw the\r\n_annelide_ seize the _teredo_, hurry away with it to the hole which he\r\noccupied, and so completely devour it that he finally left only the two\r\nvalves of the shell. Our illustrations of the _teredo_ and _lycoris_\r\nare derived from the works of Mr. Paton and M. Forestier; and our own\r\nsketches.\r\n\r\nIf the _lycoris_ would only destroy the _teredo_, when the mollusc was in\r\nits infancy, what an invaluable little annelide it would be!\r\n\r\nIt appears to us a great pity that the woods we have named, or some of\r\nthem, are not brought over to England in large quantities for harbour\r\nworks. In Ceylon and India, the trees are felled by Indian wood-cutters\r\nat little cost; they are then dragged to the river banks by elephants\r\nor buffaloes, to be floated down the rivers to the different ports, so\r\nthat labour is cheap. The question then remains, how to get the woods\r\nto England? When the ‘Great Eastern ship has finished carrying cables,\r\nperhaps its owners will not object to send the ship on a few voyages\r\nwith heavy cargoes to India, Demerara, &c., bringing home “teredo-proof\r\nwoods,” _at moderate charges for freight_?\r\n\r\nFinally, to place the subject in a practical form, we think the\r\nInstitute of Civil Engineers, of London, would be heartily thanked by\r\nthe engineering world if they would appoint a committee to inquire into\r\nthe damages done to works by sea-worms; why they are found in some parts\r\nof a roadstead or harbour, and not in others; to consider the different\r\nremedies which have been proposed, their cost, and method of application;\r\nwhat course should be adopted to prevent sea-water injuriously affecting\r\niron piles; and lastly, to publish a detailed account of their\r\nexperiments and recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nON THE DESTRUCTION OF WOODWORK IN HOT CLIMATES BY THE TERMITE OR WHITE\r\nANT, WOOD-CUTTER, CARPENTER BEE, &c., AND THE MEANS OF PREVENTING THE\r\nSAME.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the ant proper, or that belonging to the order _Hymenoptera_, there\r\nare three species[24] in particular which attack timber, viz.:\r\n\r\n1st. _Formica fuliginosa_, or black carpenter ant, which selects hard and\r\ntough woods.\r\n\r\n2nd. _Formica fusca_, or dusky ant, which prefers soft woods.\r\n\r\n3rd. _Formica flava_, or yellow ant, which also prefers soft woods.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter bee prefers particular kinds of wood. In India it is very\r\nfond of cadukai (_Tamil_) wood, which is often used for railway sleepers.\r\nRound the holes it makes there is a black tinge, arising, probably, from\r\nthe iron in its saliva acting on the gallic acid of the timber. Providing\r\nit meets with the wood it prefers, it is not very particular whether it\r\nis standing timber, or the beams of a residence.\r\n\r\nThe termite, or white ant, is a terrible destroyer of wood in nearly\r\nall tropical countries. There are many species of termite, and all are\r\nfearfully destructive, being indeed the greatest pest of the country\r\nwherein they reside. Nothing, unless cased in metal, can resist their\r\njaws; and they have been known to destroy the whole woodwork of a house\r\nin a single season. They always work in darkness, and, at all expenditure\r\nof labour, keep themselves under cover, so that their destructive labours\r\nare often completed before the least intimation has been given. For\r\nexample, the termites will bore through the boards of a floor, drive\r\ntheir tunnels up the legs of the tables or chairs, and consume everything\r\nbut a mere shell no thicker than paper, and yet leave everything\r\napparently in a perfect condition. Many a person has only learned the\r\nreal state of his furniture by finding a chair crumble into dust as he\r\nsat upon it, or a whole staircase fall to pieces as soon as a foot was\r\nset upon it. In some cases the termite lines its galleries with clay,\r\nwhich soon becomes as hard as stone, and thereby produces very remarkable\r\narchitectural changes. For example, it has been found that a row of\r\nwooden columns in front of a house have been converted into a substance\r\nas hard as stone by these insects. In pulling down the old cathedral _at\r\nJamaica_, some of the timbers of the roof, which were of hard wood, were\r\neaten away, and a cartload of nests formed by the ants was removed, after\r\nbeing cut away by great labour with hatchets.\r\n\r\nThe first indication of a house being attacked by ants in the tropics\r\nis, perhaps, the yielding of a floor board in the middle of a room, or\r\nthe top hinge of a door suddenly leaving the frame to which it had been\r\nfirmly screwed a short time before.\r\n\r\nThat the ants provide for winter--as not only Dr. Bancroft and many\r\nothers, even King Solomon, reports--is found to be an error. Where there\r\nis an ordinary winter, the ants lie dormant, during which torpid state\r\nthey do not want food.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of species belong to the tropical regions, where they\r\nare useful in destroying the fallen trees that are so plentiful in those\r\nlatitudes, and which, unless speedily removed, might be injurious to the\r\nyoung saplings by which they are replaced. Two species, however, are\r\nknown in Europe, namely, _Termes lucifugus_ and _Termes rucifollis_, and\r\nhave fully carried out their destructive character, the former species\r\ndevouring oaks and firs, and the latter preferring olives and similar\r\ntrees. _At La Rochelle_ these insects have multiplied so greatly as to\r\ndemand the public attention.\r\n\r\nM. de Quatrefages, who visited one of the spots in which these\r\ndestructive insects had settled themselves, gives the following account\r\nof their devastating energy: “The prefecture and a few neighbouring\r\nhouses are the principal scene of the destructive ravages of the\r\ntermites, but here they have taken complete possession of the premises.\r\nIn the garden not a stake can be put into the ground, and not a plank\r\ncan be left on the beds, without being attacked within twenty-four or\r\nforty-eight hours. The fences put round the young trees are gnawed from\r\nthe bottom, while the trees themselves are gutted to the very branches.\r\n\r\n“Within the building itself the apartments and offices are all alike\r\ninvaded. I saw upon the roof of a bedroom that had been lately repaired\r\ngalleries made by the termites which looked like stalactites, and\r\nwhich had begun to show themselves the very day after the workmen left\r\nthe place. In the cellars I found similar galleries, which were either\r\nhalf way between the ceiling and the floor, or running along the walls\r\nand extending, no doubt, up to the very garrets, for on the principal\r\nstaircase other galleries were observed, between the ground floor and\r\nthe second floor, passing under the plaster wherever it was sufficiently\r\nthick for the purpose, and only coming to view at different points where\r\nthe stones were on the surface, for, like other species, the termites of\r\nLa Rochelle always work under cover wherever it is possible for them to\r\ndo so. It is generally only by incessant vigilance that we can trace the\r\ncourse of their devastations and prevent their ravages.\r\n\r\n“At the time of M. Audoin’s visit a curious proof was accidentally\r\nobtained of the mischief which this insect silently accomplishes. One\r\nday it was discovered that the archives of the department were almost\r\ntotally destroyed, and that without the slightest external trace of any\r\ndamage. The termites had reached the boxes in which these documents were\r\npreserved by mining the wainscoting, and they had then leisurely set to\r\nwork to devour these administrative records, carefully respecting the\r\nupper sheets and the margin of each leaf, so that a box which was only\r\nfilled by a mass of rubbish seemed to enclose a file of papers in perfect\r\norder.\r\n\r\n“The hardest woods are attacked in the same manner. I saw on one of the\r\nstaircases an oak post, in which one of the clerks had buried his hand\r\nup to the wrist in grasping at it for support, as his foot accidentally\r\nslipped. The interior of the post was entirely formed of empty cells, the\r\nsubstance of which could be scraped away like dust, while the layer that\r\nhad been left untouched by the termites was not thicker than a sheet of\r\npaper.”\r\n\r\nIt is most probable that these insects had been imported from some\r\nvessel, as they attacked two opposite ends of the same town, the centre\r\nbeing untouched. M. de Quatrefages tried many experiments on these\r\ninsects with a view of discovering some method of destroying them, and\r\ncame to the conclusion that if _chlorine_ could be injected in sufficient\r\nquantities, it would in time have the desired result.\r\n\r\nThe termite or white ant is represented by Linnæus as the greatest pest\r\nof both Indies, because of the havoc they make in all buildings of wood,\r\nin utensils, and in furniture. They frequently construct nests within\r\nthe roofs and other parts of houses, which they destroy if not speedily\r\nextirpated. The larger species enter under the foundations of houses,\r\nmaking their way through the floors and up the posts of buildings,\r\ndestroying all before them; and so little is seen of their operations\r\nthat a well-painted building is sometimes found to be a mere shell, so\r\nthin that the woodwork may be punched through with the point of the\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\nMany kinds of wood _in Brazil_[25] are impervious to the termite, which\r\ninsect generally selects the more porous woods, and especially if\r\nthese are in contact with the earth. In dry places, and with _a free\r\ncirculation of air_, it does not prefer timber thus situated; and it is\r\nfound that roofs of buildings of _good_ and well-seasoned native wood\r\nresist for an indefinite period both the climate and the termite. As a\r\ngeneral rule, Brazilian timber is very brittle.\r\n\r\nIt shows the difference of effects between one climate and another, that\r\nin Brazil the more porous and open-grained timbers are most subject to\r\nthe attacks of the white ant, especially if they are in contact with the\r\nearth; but _in Australia_ it is the reverse, for there it is the hardest\r\ndescription of timber that those insects first attack. There is one wood\r\nin particular, in common use, to which this remark applies, namely, “Iron\r\nBark.” Its density is so great that it sinks in water, and its strength\r\nis extraordinary, and yet the wood the white ants are particularly fond\r\nof. In the West Indies, the ants prefer hard woods.\r\n\r\n_At Bahia_, the timber is less affected by the termite than _in\r\nPernambuco_; but even in the latter place the white ant does not like dry\r\nplaces with a free circulation of air.\r\n\r\nMr. Shields, when on a short visit to Pernambuco, examined some timber\r\nbridges, and in one, which had only been constructed three years, he\r\nfound the ends of the timber had been placed in contact with the moist\r\nclay; at those places he could readily knock off the crust of the wood,\r\nand the interior of the wood was almost filled with white ants: the\r\ndecay was augmented by the contact of the wood with the moist clay.\r\nWe have been informed that timber for the Government works is stored\r\nto the depth of about 1 foot 6 inches in the sea-sand, to protect it\r\nfrom the white ants and the _teredo_; and that in Pernambuco, since the\r\nestablishment of the gas-works, the Brazilian engineers and constructors\r\n“pay” over the ends of all timbers used in buildings with coal-tar.\r\n\r\n_In Ceylon_, no timber--except ebony and ironwood, which are too hard;\r\npalmyra, in _northern_ Ceylon; and those which are strongly impregnated\r\nwith camphor or aromatic oils, which they dislike--presents any obstacle\r\nto their ingress. Sir Emerson Tennant, in his work on Ceylon, says: “I\r\nhave had a cask of wine filled, in the course of two days, with almost\r\nsolid clay, and only discovered the presence of the white ants by the\r\nbursting of the corks. I have had a portmanteau in my tent so peopled\r\nwith them in the course of a single night that the contents were found\r\nworthless in the morning. In an incredibly short time a detachment of\r\nthese pests will destroy a press full of records, reducing the paper to\r\nfragments; and a shelf of books will be tunnelled into a gallery, if it\r\nhappened to be in their line of march.”\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon, the huts are plastered over with earth, which has been thrown\r\nup by white ants, after being mixed with a powerful binding substance\r\n(produced by the ants themselves), and through which the rain and\r\nmoisture cannot penetrate. This will hold the walls together when the\r\nentire framework and the wattles have been eaten, or have become decayed.\r\n\r\n_In the Philippine Islands_, ambogues, a strong, durable wood, suffers\r\nmuch from the termites. Sir John Bowring, in his work on these islands,\r\nthus writes of the ravages of the white ants in the town of Obando,\r\nProvince of Bulacan, Philippine Islands: “It appears that on the 18th\r\nMarch, 1838, the various objects destined for the services of the\r\nmass, such as robes, albs, amices, the garments of the priests, &c.,\r\nwere examined, and placed in a trunk made of the wood called ‘narra’\r\n(_Pterocarpus palidus_). On the 19th they were used in the divine\r\nservices, and in the evening were restored to the box. On the 20th some\r\ndirt was observed near it, and, on opening it, every fragment of the\r\nvestments and ornaments of every sort were found to have been reduced to\r\ndust, except the gold and silver lace, which were tarnished with a filthy\r\ndeposit. On a thorough examination not an ant was found in any other\r\npart of the church, nor any vestige of the presence of these voracious\r\ndestroyers; but five days afterwards they were discovered to have\r\npenetrated through a beam 6 inches thick.”\r\n\r\nThe red ant _in Batavia_ (north-west end of Java) is another devastator.\r\nThe red ant contains formic acid (acid of ants) and a peculiar resinous\r\noil. Thunberg[26] has found cajeput effectual in destroying the red ants\r\nof Batavia: he used it to preserve his boxes of specimens from them. When\r\nants were placed in a box anointed with this oil, they died in a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n_In Surinam_, Guiana, several species of worms are produced in the\r\npalm-trees as soon as they commence to rot: they are called “groo-groo,”\r\nand are produced from the spawn of a black beetle; they are very fat,\r\nand grow to the size of a man’s thumb. The groo-groo will very quickly\r\ndestroy wood which has commenced to rot.\r\n\r\n_In Surinam_, Captain Stedman[27] was obliged to drive nails into the\r\nceiling of his room, and hang his provisions from the nails; he then made\r\na ring of dry chalk around them, very thick, which crumbled down the\r\nmoment the ants attempted to pass it. In Guiana, the young ants will swim\r\nacross a small pool of water to get at sugar; some get drowned, the rest\r\nget the sugar.\r\n\r\n_In Japan_, according to Kœmpfer,[28] ants do considerable damage to wood.\r\n\r\n_In Senegal_, the ant (_Termite belliqueux_) is a formidable agent of\r\ndestruction. In a season, all the carpentry of a house is destroyed by\r\nthem. Spartimann, in his ‘Voyage to the Cape of Good Hope,’[29] gives an\r\nexcellent account of their methods of working.\r\n\r\nThe _Termite lucifuge_ has been discovered in the environs of _Bordeaux_,\r\nin the pine-trees; also in the marine workshops at _Rochefort_. It is\r\nbelieved to have been imported from America.\r\n\r\nThe _Termite flavicole_, a few years since, attacked the olive-trees of\r\n_Spain_, and it occasionally visits the centre of _France_.\r\n\r\nWhite or yellow pine wood can only be used in the tropics for doors,\r\nmovable window frames, bodies of railway waggons, or other work intended\r\nto be kept in motion. Its use even for these purposes is questionable, as\r\nthe white ant has such an affinity for it, that a door or a window which\r\nhas remained shut for a few weeks will almost invariably be attacked by\r\nthat insect.\r\n\r\nNorth American pitch pine withstands very well the attacks of the\r\ntermite, when used in the roofs of buildings, or in any locality not\r\nhumid; but it is found after a time, when laid upon the earth, to lose\r\nits resisting powers, as well as to become subject to rapid decay.\r\n\r\n“Greenheart” timber in its natural state is proof against the attacks\r\nof this insect in tropical climates--especially that known as the\r\n“purple-heart” wood. There are two reasons why it enjoys this immunity\r\nfrom attack: first, there is its great hardness; and, secondly, there\r\nis the presence of a large quantity of essential oil. It is very hard\r\nand durable wood; a little heavier than water. It is obtained at\r\nDemerara.[30] Great care is required in working it, as it is very liable\r\nto split. In sawing it is necessary to have all the logs bound tightly\r\nwith chains, failing which precaution the log would break up into\r\nsplinters, and be very apt to injure the men working it.\r\n\r\n“Jarrah” wood, from Australia, is also proof against the attacks of the\r\nwhite ant. It is occasionally liable to shakes.\r\n\r\n“Panao” wood, from the Philippine Islands, gives the talay oil, which\r\ndestroys insects in wood.\r\n\r\n“Bilian” wood is imported to Bombay, from Sarawak, Borneo. This wood is\r\nimpervious to the attacks of the termite, and does not decay when under\r\nfresh or salt water, where it remains as hard as stone.\r\n\r\n“Sál” wood, in India, is occasionally touched by the white ant. This\r\nwood, however, requires two years to season, and it will twist, shrink,\r\nand warp whenever the surface is removed, after many years’ seasoning.\r\nOnly about 2 lb. of creosote oil per cubic foot can be injected into\r\nsál wood. “Kara-mardá” is avoided by this little insect; but when used\r\nfor planks it requires twelve to fifteen months’ previous seasoning.\r\n“Neem-wood,” used for making carved images, enables an image to remain\r\nundisturbed by the white ant.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of woods which resist for a long time, if not\r\naltogether, the attacks of the termites, or white ants:\r\n\r\n    ANT-RESISTING WOODS.\r\n\r\n    _America._--Butternut, pitch pine. (Pitch pine is sometimes\r\n    attacked.)\r\n\r\n    _Australia, Western._--Jarrah.\r\n\r\n    _Borneo._--Bilian.\r\n\r\n    _Brazil._--The sicupira assú, sicupira meirim, or verdadeiro,\r\n    sicupira acari, oiticira, gararoba, paó saulo, sapucaia de Pilao,\r\n    sapucarana, paó ferro, and imberiba, resist the white ant,\r\n    _except_ in the sapwood. The angelim amargozo, araroba, pitia,\r\n    cocâo, bordâo de Velha, ameira de Sertao, parohiba, cedro, louro\r\n    cheiroso, and louro ti, resist the white ant, _even_ in the\r\n    sapwood.\r\n\r\n    _Ceylon._--Ebony, ironwood, palmyra, jack, gal-mendora, paloo,\r\n    cohambe.\r\n\r\n    _Demerara._--Greenheart.\r\n\r\n    _Guiana, British._--Determa, cabacalli, kakatilly.\r\n\r\n    _India._--Cedar, sál, neem, kara mardá, sandal, erul, nux vomica,\r\n    thetgan, teak. (Ants will bore through teak to get at yellow\r\n    pine.)\r\n\r\n    _Indies, West._--Bullet wood, lignum vitæ, quassia wood.\r\n\r\n    _Pernambuco (Brazil)._--Maçaranduba (red), barubú (purple),\r\n    mangabevia de Viado.\r\n\r\n    _Philippine Islands._--Molave, panao.\r\n\r\n    _Tasmania._--Huon pine.\r\n\r\n    _Trinidad._--Sepe.\r\n\r\nIn piles of wooden sleepers which have been lying ready for use _in\r\nIndia_ for about six months, at least 10 per cent. have been found\r\ndestroyed by ants. It has been supposed that the jarring motion of a\r\ntrain on a railway would prevent the white ant from destroying the timber\r\nsleepers; but there is reason to doubt this, from the fact that on an\r\nexamination of the ‘Hindostan’ steam vessel, a considerable portion\r\nof her timber framing was found to be eaten away by that destructive\r\ninsect, particularly in the parts close to the engine and boilers, where\r\nthere had been the greatest amount of vibration. The telegraph posts are\r\nparticularly subject to their depredations so long as the timber is sunk\r\nin the ground; but when a metallic socket is supplied, the wood is safe\r\nfrom their visits. A further precaution is taken to preserve the lower\r\nend of the post by running liquid dammer into the metallic sheath, so\r\nthat the enclosed part of the post is encased with a coating of resin.\r\nThe telegraph wires when covered with guttapercha (a vegetable substance)\r\nare also liable to their attacks.\r\n\r\nNumerous expedients have been suggested for getting rid of this\r\ndestructive insect, some of which have been successful, but the majority\r\nonly partially so.\r\n\r\nIn India, the timbers of a house infested with white ants are\r\nperiodically beaten to drive them away. Of course, this only succeeds for\r\na short time, as they soon return.\r\n\r\nThe salt vessels plying on the coast of India use oil of tar, and a\r\nconsiderable quantity of castor-oil, mixed with cow-dung mortar, which,\r\nwhile it adheres to the wood, is an effectual protection against ants\r\nand rot. The earth oil, or Arracan oil, is considered as good as creosote\r\nto protect wood from ants. It can be obtained at Moulmein and Rangoon, in\r\nleathern bottles or skins, at about 6_d._ per gallon.\r\n\r\nIt used to be a practice _in the West Indies_ to destroy whole colonies\r\nof ants which had built their nests either on trees or under the roofs of\r\nhouses, by shooting powdered arsenic out of a quill into an orifice made\r\ninto their covered ways, along which they ascended and descended from and\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that the depredations of the white ant in India\r\ncosts the Indian Government 100,000_l._ a year, which is expended in\r\nrepairing the woodwork of houses, barracks, bridges, &c.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Boucherie gave up his sulphate of copper process for the use\r\nof the French public, he received _a national reward_. If the Indian\r\nGovernment is disposed to give us _a national reward_, we could show how\r\nit may save at least half the 100,000_l._ a year--which is expended in\r\nrepairing the damages done by the white ants--with little trouble.\r\n\r\nIn the Madras Presidency periodical inspections have to be made, not\r\nonly with regard to the white ant, but with respect to the presence and\r\nsubsequent germination of vegetable matter or seeds in the mortar. In\r\nsome instances, where proper precautions had not been taken, roots had\r\nformed very rapidly, and of such great size as to bodily dislodge by\r\ntheir pressure large stones from buildings. Therefore, to prevent this\r\ngermination, a proportion of “Jagherry,” or coarse native sugar, varying\r\nfrom 2 per cent. in ordinary work, to from 5 per cent. to 8 per cent. in\r\narch work, is mixed with the lime.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, in consequence of the ravages of the white ants in the King’s\r\nMagazine, Fort William, India, the flooring and powder racks had to\r\nbe reinstated. Captain A. Fraser, R.E., had the basement covered with\r\nconcrete, 4 lb. of yellow arsenic being added to every 100 cubic feet\r\nof concrete. In the mortar used for the pillars arsenic was used in\r\nthe proportion of ½ lb. to every 100 cubic feet of brickwork; a small\r\nquantity of arsenic was also mixed with the paint, and ½ lb. (four\r\nchittacks) of arsenic was also mixed with every 100 superficial feet of\r\nplaster. In 1859 the town mayor reported to the Government that no traces\r\nof white ants had since been found either inside or outside the building.\r\n\r\nColonel Scott, when Acting Chief Engineer, Madras Presidency, reported to\r\nthe Government, December 24, 1858, that the following receipt was used\r\nfor exterminating white ants in the Madras Presidency, and was found to\r\nbe very successful:\r\n\r\n                    lb. oz.\r\n    Arsenic          2   4\r\n    Aloes            2   4\r\n    Chunam soap      2  13 (common country soap).\r\n    Dhobies mud      2   8 (Khar).\r\n\r\nPound the arsenic and aloes, scrape the soap, mix with mud, and boil in a\r\nlarge chatty half full of water until it bubbles; let it cool, and when\r\ncold, fill up with cold water. The mixture should boil for nearly an\r\nhour: it is applied as a wash.\r\n\r\nThe white ants of Calcutta are small in comparison with those of the\r\nupper provinces.\r\n\r\nColonel Scott, Chief Engineer at Bombay, records instances of timber\r\nbeing boiled under pressure in various antiseptic solutions, such as\r\nsulphate of copper, arsenious acid, and corrosive sublimate, with\r\nsatisfactory results; but considerable apparatus is necessary, and the\r\nexpense forbids its use except in large public works. On the other hand,\r\nin 1847, Mr. G. Jackson, being engaged under Mr. Rendel, C.E., on works\r\nin India, tried several experiments with Mr. J. Bourne, in order to\r\ntest the possibility of preserving timber from the ravages of the white\r\nant. Ninety pieces of wood, 9 inches long by 4 inches square, saturated\r\naccording to the different processes of Burnet, Payne, and Margary,[31]\r\nunder the direction of the patentees themselves, were experimented upon,\r\nin five situations, one with a considerable amount of moisture, and four\r\ndry; through inadvertency Mr. Bethell’s specimens were only tested in the\r\ndry positions. The result was, that where there was moisture the timber\r\nwas entirely destroyed, whilst where they were kept dry the result was\r\nbetter, but still not satisfactory. It seems difficult to account for\r\nthese different results obtained by Colonel Scott and Mr. Jackson; but\r\nevidently the same strength of solutions, and the same qualities and\r\ndescriptions of woods, cannot have been used by each gentleman.\r\n\r\nCaptain Mann and Captain McPherson painted the joists and planking of\r\nseveral buildings at Singapore with _gambir composition_, and the result\r\nwas perfect success, although the buildings had been previously infested\r\nwith white ants. Gutta gambir is juice extracted from the leaves of\r\na plant of the same name (_Uncaria gambir_) growing in Sumatra, &c.,\r\ninspissated by decoction, strained, suffered to cool and harden, and then\r\ncut into cakes of different sizes, or formed into balls. Chief places\r\nof manufacture, Siak, Malacca, and Bittany; gambir is now imported to\r\nEngland to a slight extent. The gambir composition referred to is made\r\nas follows: Dissolve three pints of gambir in twelve pints of dammer-oil\r\nover a slow fire; then stir one part of lime, sprinkling it over the top\r\nto prevent its coagulating and settling in a mass at the bottom; it must\r\nbe well and quickly stirred. It should then be taken out of the cauldron,\r\nand ground down like paint on a muller till it is smooth, and afterwards\r\nreturned to the pot and heated. A little oil should be added to make\r\nit tractable, and the composition can then be laid over the material.\r\nTo be treated with a common brush. Against the _Teredo navalis_ may be\r\nsubstituted the same proportion of black varnish or tar for dammer-oil,\r\nof course omitting the grinding down, which would not answer with tar.\r\n\r\nBurnett’s chloride of zinc process is said to be a good preservative for\r\nwood liable to be attacked by ants: the zinc penetrates to the heart of\r\nthe wood.\r\n\r\nCreosoted timber, it is well known, resists the attacks of the white\r\nants; but the close grain of the generality of tropical timber renders\r\nany attempt to creosote it all but useless. Of course, creosoted fir\r\ntimber could be, in fact is, exported from England, but the cost of\r\nfreight and other charges will always make it very expensive, and be a\r\ngreat drawback to its general use abroad. Mr. J. C. Mellis, Engineer to\r\nthe Government of St. Helena, writes in very high terms of creosoted\r\ntimber as used there, where the white ant abounds. Between the years 1863\r\nand 1866, experiments[32] were made with many specimens of woods (by\r\norder of the Lieutenant-Governor), in order to find out those which would\r\nresist the white ant. Teak remained uninjured; jarrah wood was partially\r\ndestroyed; while pitch-pine, oak, cedar, ash, elm, birch, beech, and\r\nmahogany, were quite destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon creosoted timber is not attacked by white ants, but the black\r\ncoating, if exposed, renders it so heat-absorbing, that it is apt to\r\nsplit, and, unless thoroughly impregnated with the creosote, a road is\r\nopened to the inside, and the ants will soon destroy all that part which\r\nis unprotected.\r\n\r\nCoal-tar will destroy white ants. Some years ago Mr. Shields took short\r\nbaulks of timber where the ants had commenced operations, and tried the\r\nsystem of pouring a very small stream of coal-tar through the heart of\r\nthe timber which the ants had hollowed out, and afterwards splitting it\r\nopen to see the result. He found the white ants completely destroyed;\r\nthey were shrivelled up like shreds of half-burnt paper by the mere\r\neffluvium of the coal-tar.\r\n\r\nCreosoting is excellent for railway sleepers, piles, &c., but it will not\r\ndo for buildings, which the white ants prefer. It is objectionable for\r\ndwellings; 1st, on account of its smell, which is disagreeable; 2nd, on\r\naccount of its colour, black, which is unsightly; 3rd, on account of its\r\ninflammability.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the depredations of white ants, anything of a bitter taste\r\ninjected into the fibre of the wood prevents their attacks, though it may\r\nnot be so good as coal-tar; even a small quantity of turpentine has the\r\neffect of killing them instantly. Carbolic acid has been used, but its\r\nsmell is objectionable. In South America, the leaves of the black walnut\r\nare soaked in water for some hours, then boiled; and when the liquid\r\nhas cooled, it is applied to the skins of horses and other animals, to\r\nprevent their being bitten or “worried” by insects. We do not know if\r\nthis has been used as a wash, or injected into wood, to prevent it being\r\n“worried” by ants.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that there is no remedy generally adopted in tropical\r\nclimates for preventing the depredations of the white ants; but there is\r\none method very frequently adopted in hot countries of getting rid of\r\nthem. It is a desperate remedy, we admit, but desperate cases frequently\r\nrequire desperate remedies: it is simply by EATING THEM. Europeans have\r\npronounced the termites to be peculiarly delicate and well flavoured,\r\nsomething like sweetened cream. The termites are prepared for the table\r\nby various methods, some persons pounding them so as to form them\r\ninto a kind of soft paste, while others roast them like coffee-beans\r\nor chestnuts. Termites, or white ants, are eaten by various African\r\ntribes, both raw and boiled; and it is said that the Hottentots “get\r\ninto good condition on this diet.” In India, the natives capture great\r\nquantities of these insects, which they mix up with flour, producing a\r\nkind of pastry, which is purchased at a cheap rate by the poorer classes.\r\nIn Ceylon, bears feed on the termites. Some of the Africans prepare\r\nlarge quantities of them for food, by parching them in kettles over a\r\nslow fire; in this condition they were eaten by handfuls as delicious\r\nfood. The traveller Smeathman states that he often ate them dressed in\r\nthis way, and found them to be “delicate, nourishing, and wholesome,\r\nresembling in flavour sugared cream, or sweet-almond paste.” In Brazil,\r\nthe yellow ants are eaten by many persons. Humboldt states that in some\r\nof the South American countries ants are mixed with resin and eaten as\r\na sauce. In Siam, ants’ eggs are considered a luxury; they are sent to\r\nthe table curried, or rolled in green leaves mingled with fine slices\r\nor shreds of fat pork. In Sweden, ants are distilled along with rye to\r\ngive a flavour to the inferior kinds of brandy. Chemists have ascertained\r\nthat ants secrete a pleasant kind of vinegar, or a peculiar acid, called\r\nformic acid.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil, however, the eating process goes on extensively as follows:\r\n\r\n1st. Ants eat the wood.\r\n\r\n2nd. Ant-eaters eat the ants.\r\n\r\n3rd. Woodsmen eat the ant-eaters.\r\n\r\n4th. Wild animals eat the woodsmen.\r\n\r\nTeak-oil, extracted from teak chips, was, in 1857, recommended by a\r\nMr. Brown to the Government of St. Helena, through the Government of\r\nMadras. Timber coated with this oil, as reported to the Secretary to the\r\nGovernment of Madras by the several executive engineers of the Public\r\nWorks Department, even when placed in a nest of white ants, was not\r\ntouched by them. The cost of this oil, in certain experiments made by\r\norder of the Madras Government, in 1866, was reported to be 6¾ annas for\r\n1¼ ounce, which is too expensive. In the central provinces the cost would\r\nbe 1¼ anna per quart.[33]\r\n\r\nIn the East Indies there are several species of wood-cutter (_Xylocopa_)\r\nand carpenter bee (_Xylocopa_), which confine their ravages to the wood\r\nafter it has been felled. The wood-cutter tunnels through the beams and\r\nposts of buildings, which they frequent in great numbers. The passages\r\nare from 12 to 15 inches long, and more than half an inch in diameter. If\r\nthe insects are numerous, their ravages are dangerously destructive, and\r\nthey soon render beams unsafe for supporting the roof.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter bee of Southern Africa is one of those curious insects\r\nwhich construct a series of cells in wood. After completing their\r\nburrow, which is open at each end, they close the bottom with a flooring\r\nof agglutinated sawdust, formed of the morsels bitten off during the\r\noperation of burrowing, lay an egg upon this floor, insert a quantity of\r\n“bee-bread,” made of the pollen of flowers and their juices, and then\r\ncover the whole with a layer of the same substance that was used for\r\nthe floor. Upon this is laid another egg, another supply of bee-bread\r\nis inserted, and a fresh layer of sawdust superimposed. Each layer is\r\ntherefore the floor of one cell and the ceiling of another, and the\r\ninsect makes on the average about ten or twelve of these cells.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter bee destroys the woodwork of buildings in the north of\r\nCeylon, but in the south of the island woodwork has two enemies to\r\ncontend against, viz. the porcupine and a little beetle. The porcupine\r\ndestroys many of the young palm-trees, and the ravages of the cocoa-nut\r\nbeetle (_Longicornes_) are painfully familiar to the cocoa-nut planters.\r\nThe species of beetle, called by the Singalese “cooroominya,” is very\r\ndestructive to timbers. It also makes its way into the stems of the\r\nyounger trees, and after perforating them in all directions, it forms\r\na cocoon of the gnawed wood and sawdust, in which it reposes during\r\nits sleep as a pupa, till the arrival of the period when it emerges as\r\na perfect beetle. Mr. Capper relates that in passing through several\r\ncocoa-nut plantations, “varying in extent from twenty to fifty acres, and\r\nabout two to three years old, and in these I did not discover a single\r\nyoung tree untouched by the cooroominya.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Carpenter Bees “at work”._]\r\n\r\nSir E. Tennant thus writes of the operations of the carpenter bee on\r\nthe wooden columns of the Colonial Secretary’s official residence, at\r\nKandy, Ceylon: “So soon as the day grew warm, these active creatures were\r\nat work perforating the wooden columns which supported the verandah.\r\nThey poised themselves on their shining purple wings, as they made the\r\nfirst lodgment in the wood, enlivening the work with an uninterrupted\r\nhum of delight, which was audible to a considerable distance. When the\r\nexcavation had proceeded so far that the insect could descend into it,\r\nthe music was suspended, but renewed from time to time, as the little\r\ncreature came to the orifice to throw out the chips, to rest, or to enjoy\r\nthe fresh air. By degrees a mound of sawdust was formed at the base of\r\nthe pillar, consisting of particles abraded by the mandibles of the bee;\r\nand these, when the hollow was completed to the depth of several inches,\r\nwere partially replaced in the excavation, after being agglutinated to\r\nform partitions between the eggs, as they are deposited within.”\r\n\r\nFortunately in England the owner of a house has no opportunity\r\nof watching (“with an uninterrupted hum of delight, audible to a\r\nconsiderable distance”) the operations of the carpenter bee, on the\r\nwooden beams and posts of his building.\r\n\r\nWe must now _consider the ways_ of the wood-beetle, which will be found\r\ndescribed in the next chapter, and only write a few words before closing\r\nthis. A modern engineer is no sluggard, of that we are certain; but if\r\nhe intends erecting large buildings in any of the places abroad which we\r\nhave referred to, he will find it very necessary to pay particular notice\r\nof the following words of King Solomon:\r\n\r\n    “Go to the ant, thou sluggard; _consider her ways_, and be wise.”\r\n\r\n                                                          Proverbs vi. 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nON THE CAUSES OF DECAY IN FURNITURE, WOOD CARVINGS, ETC., AND THE MEANS\r\nOF PREVENTING AND REMEDYING THE EFFECT OF SUCH DECAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough trunks and boxes are of themselves of little importance, they\r\nderive great consequence from the valuable deposits of written papers,\r\ndeeds, books, &c., which they frequently contain, that are subject to\r\ndestruction from timber-destroying insects. It is well known that the\r\nsmell of Russian leather, which arises from an essential oil, is a\r\npreservative of books. Leather or woods impregnated with petroleum, or\r\nwith oil of coal-tar (which has a smell not much dissimilar) would be\r\nproductive of the same effect, because known to be peculiarly obnoxious\r\nto insects: these oils are, however, very inflammable.\r\n\r\nAt all times beech-wood is exposed to the attacks of beetles, and it\r\ncannot be used, even for household furniture, without being impregnated\r\nwith some kind of oil or varnish, as a defence against these insects--a\r\nvery curious fact, for the growing trees are remarkably free from the\r\nattacks of wood-devouring insects. Larch being solid, and its juices hot,\r\npungent, and bitter, is rarely affected with the larvæ of insects.\r\n\r\nMr. Westwood, Hope Professor of Zoology, Oxford, says: “The insects\r\nwhich in this country are found to be the most injurious from their\r\nhabit of burrowing into the wood of furniture, belong to three species\r\nof beetles, of small size, and cylindrical in form (the better to enable\r\nthem to work their way through the burrows in the wood), belonging to\r\nthe family _Ptinidæ_, and known under the systematic names of _Ptilinus\r\npectinicornis_, _Anobium striatum_, and _Anobium tessellatum_.\r\n\r\n“In the perfect state, the insects of the genus _Anobium_ are well known\r\nunder the name of the “deathwatch,” as these insects produce the ticking\r\nnoise occasionally heard in old houses. It is also the _Anobium striatum_\r\nwhich is so injurious in libraries; the grub burrowing through entire\r\nvolumes, and feeding upon the paper, and especially the _pasted_ backs of\r\nthe books.\r\n\r\n“The destruction of these insects, when enclosed in articles of\r\nfurniture, is by no means easy, although with care much mischief might be\r\nprevented. The saturation of the wood with some obnoxious fluid previous\r\nto its being used up in the manufacture of objects of value would be\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\n“A strong infusion of colocynth and quassia, spirits of turpentine,\r\nexpressed juice of green walnuts, and pyroligneous acid, have all been\r\nproposed. In hot climates the ravages of the _Anobium_ on books have\r\nbeen prevented by washing their backs with a fluid compound of corrosive\r\nsublimate (ten grains) and four ounces of alcohol, and the paste used in\r\nthe book covers is there also mixed with alcohol.”\r\n\r\nSir H. Davy and Professor Faraday hesitated to employ corrosive sublimate\r\nas a means of preventing the ravages of the bookworm in Earl Spencer’s\r\nlibrary, at Althorp, not feeling certain as to whether the quantity of\r\nmercury used would affect the health of the inhabitants. Amongst all the\r\ncombinations of mercury, perhaps the bi-chloride, or corrosive sublimate,\r\nis the most terrible poison. It should be remembered that there are\r\ntwo chlorides of mercury--one the proto-chloride, ordinarily known as\r\ncalomel; the other, bi-chloride, ordinarily known as corrosive sublimate;\r\nthe respective compositions of which are as follows:\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------+----------------------\r\n                                                  |   Parts by Weight.\r\n         Calomel, and Corrosive Sublimate.        +-----------+----------\r\n                                                  | Chlorine. | Mercury.\r\n  ------------------------------------------------+-----------+----------\r\n   Calomel, or proto-chloride of mercury          |      36   |   200\r\n   Corrosive sublimate, or bi-chloride of mercury |      72   |   200\r\n  ------------------------------------------------+-----------+----------\r\n\r\nHence the ratio of chlorine in these two chlorides is as one to two.\r\n\r\nBotanists have long used a solution of corrosive sublimate in alcohol,\r\nknown by the name of Smith’s solution, to preserve the specimens in their\r\nherbaria from the aggressions of insects.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. Wood, writes:[34] “I know to my cost sundry Kaffir articles\r\nbeing absolutely riddled with the burrows of these tiny beetles (_Anobium\r\nstriatum_), and not to be handled without pouring out a shower of yellow\r\ndust, caused by the ravages of the larva. The most complete wreck which\r\nthey made was that of a New Guinea bow, which was channelled from end to\r\nend by them, and in many places they had left scarcely anything but a\r\nvery thin shell of wood.\r\n\r\n“In such cases I have but one remedy, viz. injecting into the holes\r\nspirits of wine in which corrosive sublimate has been dissolved. This is\r\nnot so tedious a business as it may seem to be, as the spirit will often\r\nfind its way from one hole to another, so that if half a dozen holes\r\nbe judiciously selected, the poison will penetrate the whole piece of\r\nwood, kill all the insect inhabitants, and render it for ever impervious\r\nto their attack. The above-mentioned bow cost me but little trouble. I\r\nfirst shook out the greater part of the yellow powder, and then, placing\r\nthe bow perpendicularly, injected the spirit into several holes at the\r\nupper end. The effect was magical. The little beetles came out of the\r\nholes in all directions, and not one survived the touch of the poisoned\r\nspirit; many of them, indeed, dying before they could force themselves\r\ncompletely out of the holes. The ticking of the deathwatch is, in fact,\r\nthe call of the _anobium_ to its mate, and as the insect is always found\r\nin old woods, it is very evident why the deathwatch is always heard in\r\nold houses. There is, by the way, a species of cockroach which acts in a\r\nsimilar manner, and generally disports itself on board ship, where the\r\nsailors know it by the name of ‘Drummer.’”\r\n\r\nThe earliest account[35] we can find of the use of corrosive sublimate to\r\ndestroy worms in woods is a few words mentioned, in 1705, by M. Homberg,\r\nFrench Academian. In that year he stated that a person of position in\r\nProvence, France, knew how to make a parquet floor which would resist the\r\nworm, viz. by soaking the wood in water in which corrosive sublimate had\r\nbeen mixed, and this process he had always found to be very successful.\r\n\r\nHerr Temmnick preserved his books from the _anobium_ by dipping them in\r\na solution of quassia. Except on a small scale, however, the saturation\r\nof furniture seems scarcely practicable. Fumigation seems, however, to be\r\nmore available. For small objects, the practice adopted at the Bodleian\r\nLibrary, Oxford, on Professor Westwood’s recommendation, appears good,\r\nviz. to enclose a number of volumes in a box, shutting quite close, and\r\nplacing a small quantity of benzine in a saucer at the bottom of the\r\ncase. The same plan might be adopted with small ornamental wood-works,\r\nenclosing them in glass cases shut as nearly air-tight as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Commission appointed by the Department of Science\r\nand Art to inquire into the causes of decay in wood carvings, and the\r\nmeans of preventing and remedying the effects of such decay, which was\r\npublished in 1864, states that the action of the worm in wood carvings\r\nmay be arrested, and the worm itself destroyed, by vaporization, more\r\nespecially by the vapour of benzine; and that, after the worm has been\r\ndestroyed, further attacks from it can be prevented by treating the\r\ncarved work with a solution of chloride of mercury, either in methylated\r\nspirits of wine, or parchment size, according to the surface character of\r\nthe carving or woodwork; the strength of the solution in each case being\r\n60 grains of the chloride of mercury to a pint of fluid, whether spirits\r\nof wine or parchment size. The carving or woodwork should be placed in\r\na box, made as air-tight as possible, but with means of renewing the\r\nbenzine placed in saucers from time to time as it evaporates without\r\nopening the lid of the box. Gilded carved work and panels on which\r\npictures have been painted, and which have been attacked by the worm, can\r\nonly be treated by applying the fumes of the benzine to the back of the\r\npictures or gilded carved work: there is no reason to suppose that the\r\nvapour of the benzine would influence either the gilding of the one or\r\nthe colours of the other.\r\n\r\nThe process should always be carried out during the spring and early\r\nsummer months, according to the state of the temperature and the\r\nobservations of those in charge of the carved or other work, as to the\r\naction of the worm, which is manifested by the fine dust falling from the\r\nworm-holes, crevices, &c.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Crace was engaged in 1855 to restore some of the wood carvings\r\nin the Mercers’ Hall, London, which had been perfectly honeycombed by a\r\nsmall brown beetle about the size of a pin’s head. The carvings being\r\nfirst washed, a number of holes were bored in the back by a gimlet, and\r\nalso into every projecting piece of fruit and leaves on the face. The\r\nwhole was then placed in a long trough, 15 inches deep, and covered with\r\na solution, prepared in the following manner:--16 gallons of linseed\r\noil, with 2 lbs. of litharge finely ground, 1 lb. of camphor, and 2 lbs.\r\nof red lead, were boiled, for six hours, being well stirred the whole\r\ntime; 6 lbs. of bees’-wax was then dissolved in a gallon of spirits of\r\nturpentine, and the whole mixed while warm thoroughly together.\r\n\r\nIn this solution the carving remained for twenty-four hours. When taken\r\nout the face was kept downwards, that the oil in the holes might soak\r\ndown to the face of the carving. The dust was allowed to remain to form a\r\nsubstance for the future support of the wood, and as it became saturated\r\nwith the oil it increased in bulk, and rendered the carving perfectly\r\nsolid.\r\n\r\nNo insect has since been found to touch these carvings, as they could not\r\nsubsist on this composition.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 the carvings of Grinling Gibbons, at Belton House, were in such\r\na condition as to render it absolutely necessary that something should\r\nbe done to prevent their complete destruction. To this end they were\r\nplaced in the hands of Mr. W. G. Rogers, who undertook to experiment upon\r\ntheir restoration. This gentleman reported that the first step he took\r\nwas to have the various pieces photographed, as a means of recording the\r\nposition of each detail of the ornamentation, &c. The whole of the works\r\nwere in a serious state of decay, portions being completely honeycombed\r\nby the worm. In order to destroy or prevent any future development of\r\nthe insect within the wood, Mr. Rogers caused the whole to be saturated\r\nwith a strong solution of corrosive sublimate (bi-chloride of mercury)\r\nin water. The colour of the wood, however, suffered so seriously by the\r\naction of the mercury that it was found necessary to adopt some means of\r\nrestoring the original tint. (It gives a dark colour to the wood, which\r\nis caused by the metal contained in the sublimate.) This was effected\r\nby ammonia in the first instance, and subsequently by a slight treatment\r\nwith muriatic acid. After this the interior of the wood was injected\r\nwith vegetable gum and gelatine, in order to fill up the worm-holes and\r\nstrengthen the fabric of the carvings. A varnish of resin, dissolved\r\nin spirits of wine, was afterwards spread on the surface, and then the\r\ndismembered pieces were put together in conformity with the photographs\r\ntaken, as records, prior to the work of restoration having been commenced.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain the present condition of these carvings, seven\r\nyears after the operations detailed had been completed Mr. Rogers\r\ncommunicated with the Hon. Edward Cust, one of the trustees of the Earl\r\nBrownlow who desired him to communicate with the clerk of the works at\r\nBelton. Mr. G. A. Lowe. Mr. Lowe, in writing to Mr. Rogers, informed him\r\nthat “there is never any appearance of worm dust from the very beautiful\r\ncarving by Gibbons since you preserved it some years back.”\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers stated, at a meeting of the Royal Institute of British\r\nArchitects, a few years since, that similar carvings at Ditton Park,\r\nCashiobury, and Trinity College, Oxford, are in a state of decay, the\r\nsurface or skin, in some instances, being, covered with a deceptive white\r\nvegetable bloom, which assists in completing the work of destruction.\r\n\r\nPainting hastens the work of destruction. In the library of Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge, some of the finest carved work at some former time\r\nwas thickly painted over, preventing the escape of the insects within,\r\nwhich were compelled to feed on the last bit of woody fibre, leaving\r\nnothing but the _skeleton_ of what it once was. At Cashiobury, where can\r\nbe seen room after room of the finest of Gibbons’ work, all this charming\r\ncarving (about thirty years ago) was covered over and loaded with a thick\r\nbrown paint and heavy varnish, destroying all the delicate feathering of\r\nthe birds and veining of the leafage, the repairs being done in plaster\r\nor a composition. Flowers, each about the size of an orange, were thus\r\nleft with nothing but a skin of dust, with just enough fibre left to save\r\nthem from collapsing in the handling. All the glorious work of Gibbons in\r\nthe chapel of Trinity College, Oxford, was some years since covered with\r\na dirty, undrying oil.\r\n\r\nWe dislike painters who paint carvings as much as the servant who\r\napplied to Mrs. H---- (wife of the celebrated landscape painter) for an\r\n“appointment” as cook, and having ascertained that the master of the\r\nhouse was a “painter,” remarked, “I cannot take the situation, ma’am, as\r\nI have never lived in a _tradesman’s family_.”\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult process to remove paint from carvings, as it is not\r\npossible to scour and wash it off in the ordinary way: it must be eaten\r\noff by an alkaline solution.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the restoration of carvings which have not been\r\npainted, but only blackened by time, they must be scoured by the careful\r\nhand of an experienced man.\r\n\r\nMr. Penrose, the present architect to the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s,\r\na short time ago examined the beautiful carvings in St. Paul’s Cathedral,\r\nand he was able to state that they have not hitherto been attacked by\r\nworms. “Some portions had been broken by violence, but the state of\r\npreservation was marvellous.” Mr. Rogers also observed that “he was\r\ngreatly and agreeably surprised--contrary to his expectations--to find\r\nthe carvings in St. Paul’s in so good a state of preservation, and so\r\nfree from the attacks of insects; but such was undoubtedly the fact. How\r\nit was so he was not able to say.” Why was this? Well, Sir Christopher\r\nWren was a wise man, and when he erected St. Paul’s Cathedral, he engaged\r\nan experienced mason to remain at the Portland stone quarries, whose\r\nduty was to select every block of stone for the Cathedral, and when it\r\narrived in London it was placed _on its natural bed_. The good results\r\nof this precaution can now be seen in the good preservation of the stone\r\nat the present time. If he was so careful of the stone for the walls, no\r\ndoubt equal care was taken in the selection of the wood for carvings.\r\nBesides, the _instructions_[36] to the commissioners for rebuilding St.\r\nPaul’s were drawn up with a view of preventing decay. The following is an\r\nextract from these instructions:\r\n\r\n“And to call to your Aid and Assistance such skilful Artists, Officers,\r\nand Workmen as ye shall think fit, and to appoint each of them his\r\nseveral Charge and Employment; to minister to such Artists and Officers,\r\nand to all and every other person and persons to be imployed in the said\r\nservice, to whom you shall think meet, such Oath or Oatlis for the due\r\nperformance of their several Duties, Employments, Offices, Charges and\r\nTrusts to them or any of them to be committed as shall by you be thought\r\nreasonable and convenient; and out of such Money as shall be received for\r\nthis Work, to allow to them, and every of them, such Salaries, Wages, and\r\nRewards respectively as to you shall seem fitting and proportionable to\r\ntheir Employment and the Service they shall do.”[37]\r\n\r\nSir Christopher Wren was descended from Dutch ancestors: he was building\r\nfor a Dutch king, and we therefore perceive the reason why so much Dutch\r\nwainscot was introduced by him into England.\r\n\r\nIt seems a great pity that the beautiful carvings of Grinling Gibbons and\r\nothers should be allowed to go to decay for want of proper attention.\r\nWhy should this be? We are acquainted with some of Gibbons’ carvings,\r\nparticularly those in St. James’s Church, Piccadilly, London; but whether\r\nthey are in a state of decay unknown to any one, whether any one looks\r\nafter them, or whether it is “nobody’s business” to do so, we cannot say.\r\nEvery now and then the owner of some beautiful wooden carvings suddenly\r\nbecomes acquainted with the fact that they are thoroughly riddled through\r\nby worms, and instead of having them looked after, they are pointed at as\r\ncuriosities. Even the makers of “old furniture” take care that it shall\r\nbe bored all over, to imitate the borings of worms.\r\n\r\nBut what can be the cause of this decay? It must arise from one of two\r\ncauses; or, it may arise from both, viz. either the wood was not seasoned\r\nwhen fixed; or else the quality and description of the wood for carving\r\npurposes was not attended to. There cannot be smoke without cause, and\r\nworms cannot exist unless a suitable habitation is first provided for\r\nthem. Hard white oak is close grained, and will scarcely admit moisture;\r\nwhilst on the other hand the soft foxy-coloured oak from some parts of\r\nLincolnshire, and other places, is so porous as to imbibe it easily and\r\nretain it; and consequently is liable to early decay: in fine, the heart\r\nof this is scarcely equal to the sap of hard white oak.\r\n\r\nThe English woods least liable to the worm for carvings are cedar,\r\nwalnut, plane, and cypress; those most liable are beech, pear, alder,\r\nash, birch, sycamore, and lime. All the fine carvings at Blenheim,\r\nKidlington, and Wimpole are in _yellow deal_, while in the age just\r\nbefore nothing but lime-tree and soft wainscot were used. The beautiful\r\ncarvings of Gibbons, in the chapel of Trinity College, Oxford, are\r\nwrought in costly scented cedar and rich dark oak; those in Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge, in white lime-tree wood.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that wood to be used for carving should be hot,\r\npungent, and bitter: thoroughly obnoxious to wood-destroying insects. If\r\nwe cannot obtain this wood in England, we certainly can abroad, and one\r\nshipload would last a long time for such purposes. Take, for instance,\r\nthe _Jarrah_ of Western Australia; the _Determa_, the _Cabacalli_, and\r\n_Kakatilly_, of British Guiana; and the _Sepe_, of Trinidad: these woods\r\nare much valued where they grow, and no insects ever attack them. We do\r\nnot say that they are suitable for wood carvings, but they might be\r\ntried, and we certainly know they are not likely to be worm-eaten at\r\nthe end of a few years. They need not be discarded on account of their\r\nhardness; boxwood is hard, but some good carvings have been executed with\r\nboxwood. We can relate an anecdote about this wood. On 3rd June, 1867,\r\nMr. W. G. Rogers, the celebrated wood-carver (would that he were alive\r\nnow to read these words), was asked, at the Royal Institute of British\r\nArchitects, if boxwood is objectionable for wood carvings,[38] and he did\r\nnot reply to the question; if he had given his opinion it would have been\r\na valuable one, coming from such an authority. We must therefore get Mr.\r\nRogers’ opinion of this wood in another way. If the reader will refer to\r\nthe “Reports by the Juries,” English Exhibition, 1851, vol. ii., page\r\n1555, he will find the following words:\r\n\r\n“W. G. ROGERS, of London.--A cradle executed in boxwood for Her Majesty\r\nQueen Victoria, and richly ornamented with carved reliefs; also, a group\r\nof musical instruments, among which may be especially noticed a violin.\r\nThese works show an extraordinary dexterity in the treatment of the\r\nmaterial, and the ornaments of the cradle are in excellent taste. Prize\r\nmedal.”\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the Report of the Commission on the Decay of\r\nWood Carvings, and as this report is now rather difficult to be obtained,\r\nwe propose condensing some extracts from it, which may prove of value to\r\nthe reader.\r\n\r\nOf the three species of beetles injurious to furniture and carved work,\r\nthe first, _Ptilinus pectinicorius_ is about one-fourth of an inch\r\nin length, and the male is distinguished by its beautiful branched\r\nantennae; the second, _Anobium striatum_, which is by far the commonest\r\nand most destructive, is about one-eighth of an inch long and of a brown\r\ncolour, with rows of small dots down the back; and the third, _Anobium\r\ntessellatum_, is about one-third to one-fourth of an inch long, the back\r\nvaried with lighter and darker shades of brown scales.\r\n\r\nThese insects are produced from eggs deposited by the females in crevices\r\nof the woodwork, from which are hatched small white fleshy grubs\r\nresembling the grubs of the cockchafer in miniature, which generally\r\nlie curled upon their sides,’ making very little use of their six small\r\nfeet fixed near the head; it is in this state that the insect is chiefly\r\ninjurious, although the perfect insect itself also feeds on the wood.\r\nThese grubs make their burrows generally in the direction of the fibre of\r\nthe wood; but when it becomes thoroughly dry and old, they burrow in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nWhen full grown they cease eating, cast off their larva skins, and appear\r\nas inactive chrysalids with all the limbs lying upon the breast inclosed\r\nin little sheaths: after a short time the perfect insect bursts forth.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the insects in the perfect state takes place uniformly\r\nduring the first hot days at the beginning of summer. Where they take a\r\nliking to a piece of woodwork, they seem to devour every particle of it,\r\nand as the perfect insects possess large wings beneath their hard wing\r\nsheaths, they are often seen flying in the hot sunshine out of doors,\r\nevidently in search of suitable woodwork for themselves and their progeny.\r\n\r\nExperiments were made by Mr. G. Wallis, Secretary to the Commission,\r\nwith a view of ascertaining the best means of stopping the decay when\r\ncommenced. The course pursued, as well as the results arrived at, will be\r\nbest illustrated by a summary of Mr. Wallis’s report on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe experiments may be placed under two heads, viz. Vaporization and\r\nSaturation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. VAPORIZATION.\r\n\r\nAt the end of April, 1863, when, from the appearance of certain specimens\r\nof carved work, the worm appeared to be developed and active, a large\r\nglass case, made as air-tight as circumstances would permit, was filled\r\nwith examples of furniture, &c.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of this case was covered with white paper, and the specimens\r\nof woodwork were raised above the surface by placing blocks of wood at\r\nconvenient points. This insured the free circulation of the vapour over\r\nthe whole surface of the objects. A dozen small saucers, with pieces of\r\nsponge saturated with carbolic acid, were distributed about the bottom of\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nThe raising of the objects on blocks of wood facilitated the placing of\r\nthese saucers at any desirable point.\r\n\r\nThe carbolic acid was, in this experiment, renewed every three or four\r\ndays for a month, and a strong vapour pervaded the case for that period,\r\ndaring which there was no appearance of worms, dead or alive. At the end\r\nof May the saucers were removed, and the doors of the case thrown open,\r\nso that it might be well ventilated and cleared of vapour, after which\r\nit was closed again; but the saucers were not replaced. This closing\r\nof the case without using the vapour was to prevent the escape of any\r\nbeetles which might make their appearance, in the event of the vapour of\r\nthe creosote not having destroyed the worms. About the middle of June,\r\na fortnight after the case was closed again, beetles were seen crawling\r\nupon the white paper with which the bottom was covered. These beetles\r\nwould, no doubt, deposit their ova in the usual course, as they could not\r\nescape, and a considerable number of them were found dead upon the white\r\npaper with which the surface underneath the carved work was covered.\r\n\r\nIn order to test the efficacy of chloroform and benzine, two small glass\r\ncases, as nearly air-tight as possible, were selected, in which were\r\narranged early in May specimens of ornamental woodwork, all more or less\r\nin bad condition from the worm. The bottom of each, as in the previous\r\nexperiments, was covered with white paper; and the objects to be acted\r\nupon raised upon small blocks of wood. In one case chloroform was used,\r\nand in the other benzine in a similar manner to the carbolic acid, i. e.\r\nby placing small pieces of sponge in saucers and saturating them with\r\nthe liquid, using five saucers in each case. Both the chloroform and the\r\nbenzine had to be renewed much oftener than the carbolic acid, as the\r\nliquid evaporated much quicker.\r\n\r\nWithin a week after the experiment commenced it was evident that the\r\naction of the chloroform had destroyed the worms as they came to\r\nmaturity, and in a fortnight all the specimens of carved work having been\r\ntaken from the case, and the dust produced by the action of the worms\r\nshaken out, a number of dead ones were found, as also some dead beetles;\r\nbut these were evidently those of past seasons remaining in the crevices\r\nof the woodwork.\r\n\r\nOn examining the specimens of carved work placed in the case treated with\r\nbenzine, there was no appearance of worms or beetles dead or alive.\r\n\r\nThe two cases, with their contents, were then kept open for a week, and\r\nthoroughly ventilated to clear them as far as possible of all fumes of\r\neither chloroform or benzine.\r\n\r\nAfter this they were closed again, being then free from all traces of\r\nvapour, and were not opened for some months. Throughout the summer, the\r\ntemperature being the same as that under which beetles appeared in the\r\ncase treated with carbolic acid, no traces of worms or insects were\r\nvisible, nor could the remains of any be discovered on the white paper,\r\nwith which the lower surface of each case was covered.\r\n\r\nIt would appear then, as far as vaporization is concerned, that the\r\naction of the vapour of carbolic acid is not sufficient; in fact, it\r\nis sluggish and heavy, whilst chloroform and benzine are volatile and\r\npenetrating. The experiment with chloroform appears to prove that the\r\nvapour kills the worm, and, as no beetles appeared in the case during\r\nthe summer, it may be inferred that it _killed all_ the worms within its\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nFrom the pungency and penetrative action of the benzine, as also its\r\nvolatile character and the fact that no life in the form of either worm\r\nor beetle was manifested in the case in which it was used, it seems fair\r\nto infer that it is more effective than even the chloroform.\r\n\r\nVaporization on a large scale might be adopted by having a room made\r\nas air-tight as possible, stopping up the chimney, pasting the window\r\nframes, &c., and placing infected furniture in the room, burning\r\nbrimstone, or filling the room with fumes of prussic acid, chloroform,\r\nor benzine. It would have to be practised at the time when the perfect\r\nbeetles made their appearance; their destruction at that time involving,\r\nof course, the prevention of further injury by their progeny.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. SATURATION.\r\n\r\nThe experiments made with bi-chloride of mercury (corrosive sublimate)\r\nand methylated spirits of wine were not so successful as by vaporization,\r\non account of the woodwork when dry (after having been saturated with the\r\nsolution) having a varnished appearance.\r\n\r\nNo experiment as to the effect of saturation in a solution of corrosive\r\nsublimate in water was made: 1st, because of the great risk to delicate\r\ncarvings or pieces of furniture by their immersion in water, or the\r\nbringing up of the grain of the wood by treatment with a brush; and 2nd,\r\nbecause the vaporization by benzine appeared to be quite sufficient to\r\ndestroy the larvæ.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore terminating this chapter, we trust a few words about carvers and\r\ncarvings will not be out of place.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of carvers, the _house carvers_ and the _ship\r\ncarvers_; the former are used to flat and square surfaces, the latter to\r\nthe rake or fay, as was the old term.\r\n\r\nAbout the period of Louis XIV. Malines was remarkable for its wood\r\ncarvers, and the inhabitants might be seen sitting at their doors in the\r\nstreets, plying their art in the same manner as now in many of the German\r\nand Swiss towns. Many works of art and decoration of Flemish origin are\r\nstill preserved in England;[39] the works of Flemish carvers in wood were\r\nin great esteem, and there are numerous fine examples in the churches\r\nof Norfolk, and other parts of England which may be regarded as their\r\nproductions. Evelyn remarked that Gibbons came from the Low Countries.\r\n\r\nGrinling Gibbons created a school of carvers in England, and adopted\r\na style and manner in building up his fruit and flowers to produce a\r\ngrand effect. He chose but very few varieties of these out of his own\r\ngarden, and it is wonderful how he varied and played with those few. He\r\noriginated a peculiar description of light interlacing scroll-work,\r\nwhich is to be met with in his best works; no one has successfully\r\nattempted to carry it on since his time. There are several examples at\r\nBelton, and in the chapel and state rooms at Chatsworth, in the fine\r\ntrophies at Kirthington Park; but the upper part of the reredos of St.\r\nJames’s, Piccadilly, is a marvellous specimen.[40] The horizontal bands\r\non the great organ in St. Paul’s Cathedral are the perfection of this\r\ncharacter of foliated scroll-work.[41]\r\n\r\nGibbons’ carvings have a loose freedom about them. At Chatsworth he\r\neducated his workmen, who partook of his inspiration. There is a great\r\ndeal of his work scattered over the rooms, great hall, and staircase of\r\nLyme Hall, near Disley, which was erected under the direction of Sir C.\r\nWren. It was executed by the persons who were employed at Chatsworth, and\r\ntook nine years to complete.\r\n\r\nAt Blenheim there are some fine specimens of Chippendale’s work, but\r\nwhat it all means is a mystery. Such a mixture of scraggy birds, and\r\nflowers cut into shreds, pagodas, and rustic waterfalls--all this fine\r\nworkmanship employed to produce nothing but an incongruous whole of\r\nabsurd objects. There is a leading line in all these works, indicating\r\nwhat the old carvers used to call the C and G style; because if you\r\nattempt to draw it, it will resolve itself into these two letters. There\r\nis also the S and G style.\r\n\r\nAbolish painting and we shall again have some fine house carvers.\r\n\r\nWe have already given the conclusions at which the Commission appointed\r\nby the Department of Science and Art arrived, as to the prevention of\r\ndecay or attack by these insects, and will now conclude this chapter\r\nby quoting Dean Swift’s recipe for getting rid of the Anobium or Death\r\nwatch:--\r\n\r\n    “But a kettle of scalding hot water injected,\r\n    Infallibly cures the timber affected;\r\n    The omen is broken, the danger is over,\r\n    The maggot will die, the sick will recover.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF CURATIVE PROCESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following summary of the most approved formula for preventing and\r\ncuring the evils of rot is prepared from the works of Tredgold and\r\nWylson; some other more modern receipts have been added from ‘The\r\nBuilder,’ ‘Architect,’ ‘Building News,’ and other professional periodical\r\npublications. Discretion in their use is recommended, and in serious\r\ncases we decidedly recommend consulting a professional man who is well\r\nacquainted with the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PRESERVE WOODWORKS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO WET OR DAMP.\r\n\r\n1. For those of an extensive nature, such as bridges, &c. The Hollanders\r\nuse for the preservation of their sluices and floodgates, drawbridges,\r\nand other huge beams of timber exposed to the sun and constant changes of\r\nthe atmosphere, a certain mixture of pitch and tar, upon which they strew\r\nsmall pieces of shell broken finely--almost to a powder--and mixed with\r\nsea-sand, and the scales of iron, small and sifted, which incrusts and\r\npreserves it effectually.\r\n\r\n2. A paint composed of sub-sulphate of iron (the refuse of the copperas\r\npans), ground up with any common oil, and thinned with coal-tar oil,\r\nhaving a little pitch dissolved in it, is flexible, and impervious to\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\n3. Linseed oil and tar, in equal parts, well boiled together, and used\r\nwhile boiling, rubbed plentifully over the work while hot, after being\r\nscorched all over by wood burnt under it, strikes half an inch or more\r\ninto the wood, closes the pores, and makes it hard and durable either\r\nunder or out of water.\r\n\r\n4. For fences, and similar works, a coating of coal-tar, sanded over; or,\r\nboil together one gallon of coal-tar and 2½ lb. of white copperas, and\r\nlay it on hot.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PREVENT ROT.\r\n\r\n1. Thoroughly season the wood before fixing, and when fixed, have a\r\nproper ventilation all round it.\r\n\r\n2. Charring, after seasoning, will fortify timber against infection, so\r\nwill a coating of coal-tar.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CURE INCIPIENT DRY ROT.\r\n\r\n1. If very much infected, remove the timber, and replace with new.\r\n\r\n2. A pure solution of corrosive sublimate in water, in the proportion of\r\nan ounce to a gallon, used hot, is considered a very effectual wash.\r\n\r\n3. A solution of sulphate of copper, half a pound to the gallon of water,\r\nlaid on hot.\r\n\r\n4. A strong solution of sulphate of iron; this is not so good as sulphate\r\nof copper.\r\n\r\n5. A strong solution of sulphates of iron and copper in equal parts,\r\nhalf a pound of the sulphates to one and a half gallon of water.\r\n\r\n6. Paraffin oil, the commonest and cheapest naphtha and oil, or a little\r\nresinous matter dissolved and mixed with oil, will stay the wet rot.\r\n\r\n7. Remove the parts affected, and wash with dilute sulphuric acid the\r\nremaining woodwork.\r\n\r\n8. Dissolve one pound of sulphate of copper in one gallon of boiling\r\nwater, then add 1¼ lb. of sulphuric acid in six gallons of water, and\r\napply hot.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PREVENT WORMS IN TIMBER.\r\n\r\n1. Anointing with an oil produced by the immersion of sulphur in\r\naquafortis (nitric acid) distilled to dryness, and exposed to dissolve in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n2. Soaking in an infusion of quassia renders the wood bitter.\r\n\r\n3. Creosoting timber, if the smell is not objectionable.\r\n\r\n4. Anointing the timber with oil of spike, juniper, or turpentine, is\r\nefficacious in some degree.\r\n\r\n5. For small articles, cover freely with copal varnish in linseed oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PREVENT WORMS IN MARINE BUILDING.\r\n\r\n1. A mixture of lime, sulphur, and colocynth with pitch.\r\n\r\n2. Saturating the pores with coal-tar, either alone or after a solution\r\nof corrosive sublimate has been soaked and dried into the wood.\r\n\r\n3. Sheathing with thin copper over tarred felt is esteemed the best\r\nprotection for the bottoms of ships for all marine animals; the joints\r\nshould be stopped with tarred oakum.\r\n\r\n4. Studding the parts under water with short broad-headed nails.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DESTROY WORMS IN CARVINGS.\r\n\r\n1. Fumigate the wood with benzine.\r\n\r\n2. Saturate the wood with a strong solution of corrosive sublimate: if\r\nused for carvings, the colour should be restored by ammonia, and then by\r\na weak solution of hydrochloric acid; the holes may be stopped up with\r\ngum and gelatine, and a varnish of resin dissolved in spirits of wine\r\nshould afterwards be applied to the surface.\r\n\r\n3. Whale-oil and poisonous ointments have been found of service.\r\n\r\nThe wood should be carefully brushed before being operated upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DESTROY ANTS AND INSECTS IN WOOD.\r\n\r\n1. Corrosive sublimate is an effectual poison to them.\r\n\r\n2. Oils, especially essential oils, are good preventives.\r\n\r\n3. Cajeput-oil has been proved effectual for destroying the red ant.\r\n\r\n4. Payne’s, Bethell’s, and Burnett’s processes are said to be proof\r\nagainst the white ant of India.\r\n\r\n5. Dust the parts with pounded quicklime, and then water them with the\r\nammoniacal liquor of gas-works, when the ammonia will be instantly\r\ndisengaged by the quicklime, and this is destructive to insect life.\r\n\r\n6. For the black ant, use powdered borax; or smear the parts frequented\r\nby them with petroleum oil; or syringe their nests with fluoric acid or\r\nspirits of tar, to be done with a leaden syringe; or pour down the holes\r\nboiling water to destroy their nests, and then stop up the holes with\r\ncement. Ants dislike arsenic, camphor, and creosote.\r\n\r\nThe preceding remedies are not by any means given with the intention of\r\nsuperseding the previous chapters, which should be carefully studied by\r\nthose who wish to acquire a moderate knowledge of the subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARKS AND CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur task is nearly completed: we have but few general remarks to make.\r\n\r\nThe decay of wooden sleepers, posts, &c., on our railways and the\r\ndestruction of timber piles by worms have been the causes of directing\r\nthe attention of engineers to the preservation of timber. Most of our\r\nleading engineers now have the greater portion of the timber used\r\nin their works either creosoted or injected with chloride of zinc.\r\nArchitects, as a rule, do not, unfortunately, adopt any process for\r\npreserving timber from rot and decay; and have practically no guarantee\r\nthat timber used in their works has been thoroughly seasoned: posterity\r\nwill not thank them for this, and yet they are not solely to blame. The\r\nfault in a great measure rests with the public, who require buildings to\r\nbe erected at the least cost and in the shortest possible time. Moreover,\r\nthe works executed by our leading builders are so extensive, that they\r\nhave no room in their yards for large piles of timber to lie and season;\r\nand even if they had room it is doubtful if they would allow so much\r\nmaterial, representing money, to remain idle. We are acquainted with one\r\ninstance where a London architect, about a dozen years ago, erected a\r\npublic building. The front of the reporters’ gallery was formed of oak\r\npanelling; and within a year after the completion of the building narrow\r\nslips or tongues of wood had to be let in in several places to fill up\r\nthe holes formed by the shrinkage of the panels. Similar cases to this\r\nare by no means rare. We can quote another instance of unseasoned wood.\r\nA range of workshops was erected a few years since in South London; the\r\nprincipals of the roof were not ceiled; almost before the building was\r\nfinished the upper floor was occupied by a battalion of workwomen. The\r\nheat of the room (the ventilation being defective) soon had an effect\r\nupon the tie-beams, but one beam, which we imagine was unseasoned, in\r\nconsequence of large shakes and splits, had to be taken out and replaced\r\nwith new. We will (as a lawyer would say), cite one more case. A church\r\nin Surrey required some extensive repairs to the roof: an architect and\r\na builder were employed, and the necessary works were done. Within four\r\nyears dry rot has made its appearance on the new timbers of the roof (not\r\nan air-tight one). One of the churchwardens, on consulting us last year\r\n(1874) as to the best means of stopping the rot, energetically remarked,\r\n“Who is responsible to us for this, the architect or the builder?”\r\nCharles Dickens, in his edition of ‘Bleak House’ in 1868, wrote, with\r\nreference to long Chancery suits, “If I wanted other authorities for\r\nJarndyce and Jarndyce, I could rain them on these pages.” We are able to\r\nmake a similar remark with reference to any more instances of dry rot.\r\nAccording to the 7th chapter of the First Book of Kings, “Solomon was\r\nbuilding his own house thirteen years:” we cannot spare so much time\r\nnow-a-days over the erection of a house, but that is no reason why our\r\ntimber should not be naturally or artificially seasoned.\r\n\r\nIf we cannot obtain naturally seasoned timber, by all means let us\r\nhave artificially seasoned wood. Tredgold, in his Report on Langton’s\r\nsystem,[42] nearly arrived at the secret. We will quote a few words from\r\nhis Report:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Langton having discovered a new method of seasoning timber … by\r\nwhich the time necessary to season green timber, and render it fit for\r\nuse, is only about twice as many weeks as the ordinary process requires\r\nyears; … it is more economical, and locks up less capital than the common\r\nmethod.”\r\n\r\nWe believe we may say that the number of our public buildings which\r\nhave been erected during the present century with artificially prepared\r\ntimber can be counted on our eight fingers (without troubling our thumbs)\r\nand not exceed that number;[43] and yet we hear of dry rot in the great\r\ndome of the Bank of England and other buildings without profiting by the\r\nevents. We should like to know if the wooden dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral\r\nis safe from dry rot, (the domes at the Panthéon and the Halle-au-Blé at\r\nParis were affected,) _and plumbers fires_.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a preservative process, thoroughly suitable for\r\neveryday use and applicable to buildings, has yet to be invented: it\r\nshould be cheap, should render wood uninflammable, should preserve the\r\nwood from decay and dry rot, _should not harden the wood until some time\r\nafter its application_, and should be colourless and invisible. The\r\ninvention of such a process will require careful thought and experiments,\r\nfor it appears to us that the whole theory of any successful plan for the\r\nprevention of the dry rot must resolve itself into the _solidifying or\r\ncoagulation of albumen_: this means hardening the sap-wood, and causing\r\nincreased difficulty in working the wood. We can easily illustrate\r\nour remarks, by quoting one of the latest patents for preserving\r\ntimber, which has recently been made public. It is the invention of a\r\ngentleman living in England, who has discovered a means of making wood\r\nuninflammable, preventing dry rot and decay, and rendering white and\r\nyellow pine, both in hardness and appearance, like teak and oak. We have\r\nno objection to its rendering wood uninflammable, providing it does\r\nnot “hurt” the wood; but can the reader believe that any architect, in\r\nerecting a moderate-sized villa, would specify that all the joiners’\r\nwork, staircases, window-frames and sashes, architraves, skirtings,\r\ndoors, &c., must be formed of wood _as hard as teak_; or rather, can\r\nthe reader imagine the architect’s client would be agreeable to pay the\r\ngreatly increased cost for the extra labour involved. We do not think\r\nthis invention will ever be used, at least to any extent, in buildings.\r\n\r\nMuch yet remains to be done with regard to uninflammable wood for\r\nbuildings: we think the matter should be dealt with (with reference to\r\njoists, floor boards, partitions, doors, staircases, roof timbers, &c.)\r\nby a new Buildings Act of Parliament. Stone and iron will not burn, but\r\nthey are not fire-resisting: brick, artificial stone, and incombustible\r\nwood will give us all we desire; the details may be difficult of\r\narrangement, but builders would comply with them if they were\r\nimperatively required. At present our houses are formed of brick walls,\r\nevery room being separated vertically and horizontally from the adjoining\r\nrooms by combustible wooden walls. A street built up of fire-proof\r\nbuildings would be a novelty. The whole subject requires to be dealt with\r\nthoroughly, for while we have combustible wooden floors, partitions, &c.,\r\nwe cannot at the same time have a fire-proof building. We have not been\r\nable to spare the space, or else we should have devoted a long chapter to\r\nthis subject; a superficial consideration (such as alum and water) would\r\nhave been practically useless.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we can only summarize our remarks on the cause of dry rot,\r\nby saying, “Season and ventilate,” in every case: as to the cure, that\r\nis not so easy to deal with. If the reader has ever had a decayed tooth\r\naching, a friend has probably said, “Have it out;” and we say, wherever\r\nthere is a piece of timber decayed in a building which can be removed,\r\n“Have it out, and stop up with new;” and in so advising we are merely\r\nfollowing the advice to be found in a good old volume, which has never\r\nyet been equalled, and which says:\r\n\r\n    “And, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with\r\n    hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower\r\n    than the wall; … Then the priest shall command that they take\r\n    away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them\r\n    into an unclean place without the city: And he shall cause the\r\n    house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out\r\n    the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean\r\n    place: And they shall take other stones, and put them in the\r\n    place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall\r\n    plaister the house.”--_Leviticus_ xiv. 37, 40, 41, and 42.\r\n\r\nThis course will not, however, suit every case, for when the rot has\r\nspread in many directions, the best and cheapest course is to consult\r\nsome professional man, well versed in the peculiarities of dry rot,\r\nbefore determining upon any remedy, for we have shown in the course of\r\nthis work that the disease may arise from various causes; and it is not\r\na difficult matter to select the wrong remedy, and thus increase the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nWe trust the reader has found in this volume at least some hints which\r\nmay be of service to him. A _new_ house affected with dry rot is an\r\nunhealthy one to live in, and an _old_ one is worse than the new; we mean\r\nthe kind of house referred to in one line by an American poet, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “O’er whose unsteady floor, that sways and bends.”\r\n\r\n                                                     LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See white faces of workmen.\r\n\r\n[2] See London newspapers, July, 1812.\r\n\r\n[3] ‘Fire Surveys,’ p. 58.\r\n\r\n[4] ‘Directions to Cure the Dry Rot.’ 1807.\r\n\r\n[5] See Report of the Officers of Portsmouth Yard, 1792.\r\n\r\n[6] See Tredgold’s Report on this process, May 2, 1828.\r\n\r\n[7] See No. 1, p. 3, Appendix to first volume of ‘Naval Architecture.’\r\n\r\n[8] See paper on “Kyan’s Process” by Captain R.

Demy 4to, _copiously illustrated with woodcuts and 96 plates_,\r\nin one Volume, half-bound morocco, 2_l._ 2_s._; or cheaper edition,\r\ncloth, 25_s._\r\n\r\n    This work is not, in any sense, an elementary treatise, or\r\n    history of the steam engine, but is intended to describe examples\r\n    of Fixed Steam Engines without entering into the wide domain of\r\n    locomotive or marine practice. To this end illustrations will be\r\n    given of the most recent arrangements of Horizontal, Vertical,\r\n    Beam, Pumping, Winding, Portable, Semiportable, Corliss, Allen,\r\n    Compound, and other similar Engines, by the most eminent\r\n    Firms in Great Britain and America. The laws relating to the\r\n    action and precautions to be observed in the construction of\r\n    the various details, such as Cylinders, Pistons, Piston-rods,\r\n    Connecting-rods, Cross-heads, Motion-blocks, Eccentrics,\r\n    Simple, Expansion, Balanced, and Equilibrium Slide-valves, and\r\n    Valve-gearing will be minutely dealt with. In this connection\r\n    will be found articles upon the Velocity of Reciprocating Parts\r\n    and the Mode of Applying the Indicator, Heat and Expansion of\r\n    Steam Governors, and the like. It is the writer’s desire to draw\r\n    illustrations from every possible source, and give only those\r\n    rules that present practice deems correct.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBARLOW’S _Tables of Squares, Cubes, Square Roots, Cube Roots, Reciprocals\r\nof all Integer Numbers up to 10,000_.
