The records of every\r\ncivilization disclose attempts to delve into the past beyond the memory\r\nof the oldest man, beyond recorded history, beyond earliest legend.\r\n\r\nCuriosity about the remote past may be very ancient, but the only\r\nreliable method of measuring very long intervals of time is new. The\r\npossibility of doing so became apparent only after the discovery of\r\nRADIOACTIVITY[1] in 1896 by Henri Becquerel, when Marie and Pierre Curie\r\nin 1898 recognized that some atoms are radioactive and change by\r\nthemselves into other atoms at regular and constant rates. If something\r\ngradually transforms itself into something else, if this transformation\r\ngoes on at a known pace, and if all the products of the activity are\r\npreserved in some kind of a CLOSED SYSTEM, then it is theoretically\r\npossible to calculate the time that has elapsed since the process\r\nstarted. The theory was clear for years; the only problem was how to\r\nsatisfy all those ifs.\r\n\r\nBy 1910 it was well established that the earth must be extremely\r\nancient. Analyses of some minerals containing uranium showed them to be\r\nhundreds of millions of years old, even though the uranium came from\r\nrocks that were known to be relatively young among geologic STRATA.\r\nMeasurements still were inaccurate, however, and only a few rare and\r\nunusually rich radioactive minerals contained enough of the products of\r\nRADIOACTIVE DECAY[2] to allow analysis of their age by the crude methods\r\nthen available.\r\n\r\nNot much progress was made for about 30 years until A. O. C. Nier, a\r\nHarvard University physicist, perfected an instrument called a MASS\r\nSPECTROMETER (to be described later) just before World War II. The rapid\r\ntechnological advances of the war years followed. The Manhattan\r\nProject[3] made the atomic bombs that ended the fighting; it also\r\ndeveloped new scientific techniques that could be applied, when peace\r\nreturned, to the measurement of geologic time.\r\n\r\nThe next important advance was contributed in 1946 by Arthur Holmes in\r\nEngland and by F. G. Houtermans in Germany. Each of these scientists had\r\nseen Nier’s reports before the war and had realized that Nier’s\r\nmass-spectrometer analyses of lead made it possible, for the first time,\r\nto make rational calculations about the age of the earth. The two\r\nscientists independently calculated that age at about 2 to 3 billion\r\nyears, using the handful of data available to them from Nier’s\r\nmeasurements. It is interesting that today, thousands of analyses later,\r\nour planet’s age usually is given as 4.5 billion years. The early\r\nestimates were not far off.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of various methods for measuring the age of minerals\r\nfollowed rapidly, and by 1955 many fundamental studies needed for\r\nmeasuring the age of very old substances were complete. The basic\r\ntechniques are summarized in Table I. They will be explained later. The\r\nnew methods produced broad confirmation of the early rough estimates and\r\nthey also brought a few surprises.\r\n\r\nBefore we go into these discoveries, let us look at some theoretical\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\n                   Table I    BASIC MEASUREMENT METHODS\r\n  Method              Material      Time Dated         Useful Time Span\r\n                                                       (years)\r\n  Carbon-14           Wood, peat,   When plant died    1000-50,000\r\n                      charcoal\r\n                      Bone, shell   Slightly before    2000-35,000\r\n                                    animal died\r\n  Potassium-argon     Mica, some    When rock last     100,000 and up\r\n                      whole rocks   cooled to about\r\n                                    300°C\r\n                      Hornblende    When rock last     10,000,000 and up\r\n                      Sanidine      cooled to about\r\n                                    500°C\r\n  Rubidium-strontium  Mica          When rock last     5,000,000 and up\r\n                                    cooled to about\r\n                                    300°C\r\n                      Potash        When rock last     50,000,000 and up\r\n                      feldspar      cooled to about\r\n                                    500°C\r\n                      Whole rock    Time of            100,000,000 and up\r\n                                    separation of\r\n                                    the rock as a\r\n                                    closed unit\r\n  Uranium-lead        Zircon        When crystals      200,000,000 and up\r\n                                    formed\r\n  Uranium-238         Many          When rock last     100-1,000,000,000\r\n  fission                           cooled             (Depending on\r\n                                                       material)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Time scale of the Earth, drawn to scale.

These motions may be quite violent, but for most NUCLIDES\r\nfound in nature, the nuclear forces are powerful enough to keep\r\neverything confined; thus the nuclei of these atoms hold together, and\r\nare said to be stable. If any one nucleus of a given ISOTOPE is stable,\r\nthen all others are also stable, because what is true for one atom of a\r\ngiven kind is true for all others of the same kind.[5]\r\n\r\nSome nuclides, both man-made and natural, are unstable, however. Their\r\nnuclei are in such violent turmoil that the nuclear forces cannot always\r\nhold them together, and various bits and pieces fly off. If we were to\r\ntry to predict when one particular unstable nucleus would thus\r\ndisintegrate, however, we could not succeed, because the instant any\r\nspecific decay (or disintegration) event will occur is a matter of\r\nchance. Only if a large number of unstable nuclei of one kind are\r\ncollected together can we say with certainty that, out of that number, a\r\ncertain proportion will decay in a given time. It turns out that this\r\nproportion is the same regardless of any external conditions.\r\n\r\nThis property of nuclei to decay by themselves is called radioactivity.\r\nRadioactive nuclei decay at constant rates regardless of temperature,\r\npressure, chemical combination, or physical state. The process goes on\r\nno matter what happens to the atom. In other words, the activity inside\r\nthe nucleus is in no way affected by what happens to the ELECTRONS\r\ncircling around it. (Only in very special cases can outside disturbances\r\naffect the radioactivity of a nucleus and then only slightly. For all\r\npractical purposes, rates of radioactive decay are constant.)\r\n\r\nMost radioactive nuclides have rapid rates of decay (and lose their\r\nradioactivity in a few days, or a few years, at most); most of these are\r\nknown today only because they are produced artificially. Some of them\r\nmay have been present at the time the solar system was formed, but they\r\nhave since decayed to such insignificant fractions of their original\r\namounts that they can no longer be detected. Only a few radioactive\r\nnuclides decay slowly enough to have been preserved to this day, and so\r\nare present in nature. They are listed in Table II.\r\n\r\n  Table II    RADIOACTIVE NUCLIDES WITH HALF-LIVES LARGE ENOUGH TO BE STILL\r\n                  PRESENT IN USEFUL AMOUNTS ON THE EARTH[6]\r\n  PARENT Element   DAUGHTER         HALF-LIFE (years)    Type of Decay\r\n                   Product\r\n  Potassium-40     Argon-40         1.3 × 10⁹ (total)    ELECTRON CAPTURE\r\n                   Calcium-40                            BETA DECAY\r\n  Vanadium-50      Titanium-50      ~6 × 10¹⁵ (total)    Electron capture\r\n                   Chromium-50                           Beta decay\r\n  Rubidium-87      Strontium-87     4.7 × 10¹⁰           Beta decay\r\n  Indium-115       Tin-115          5 × 10¹⁴             Beta decay\r\n  Tellurium-123    Antimony-123     1.2 × 10¹³           Electron capture\r\n  Lanthanum-138    Barium-138       1.1 × 10¹¹ (total)   Electron capture\r\n                   Cerium-138                            Beta decay\r\n  Cerium-142       Barium-138       5 × 10¹⁵             ALPHA DECAY\r\n  Neodymium-144    Cerium-140       2.4 × 10¹⁵           Alpha decay\r\n  Samarium-147     Neodymium-143    1.06 × 10¹¹          Alpha decay\r\n  Samarium-148     Neodymium-144    1.2 × 10¹³           Alpha decay\r\n  Samarium-149     Neodymium-145    ~4 × 10¹⁴?

Let’s take this\r\nfraction as one-half and measure the time it takes for half the nuclei\r\nto decay. This time it is called the HALF-LIFE of that particular\r\nnucleus and there are various accurate physical ways of measuring it.\r\nDuring the interval of one half-life, one-half of the nuclei will decay,\r\nduring the next half-life half of what’s left will decay, and so on. We\r\nmay tabulate it like this:\r\n\r\n  Elapsed time     Amount left of\r\n  (Number of       what was\r\n  half-lives)      originally\r\n                   present\r\n  1                ½\r\n  2                ¼\r\n  3                ⅛\r\n  4                ¹/₁₆\r\n  5                ¹/₃₂\r\n  6                ¹/₆₄\r\n  7                ¹/₁₂₈\r\n  ...              ...\r\n\r\nIn other words, after seven half-lives, less than 1% of the original\r\namount of material will still be radioactive and the remaining 99%+ of\r\nits atoms will have been converted to atoms of another nuclide. This\r\nkind of process can be made the basis of a clock. It works, in effect,\r\nlike the upper chamber of an hourglass. Mathematically it is written:\r\n\r\n                             N = N₀e^{-λt}\r\n\r\n  where\r\n\r\n    N = the number of radioactive atoms present in the system now,\r\n\r\n    N₀ = the number that was present when t = 0, (in other words, at the\r\n          time the clock started),\r\n\r\n    e = the base of natural (or Napierian[8]) logarithms (the numerical\r\n          value of e = 2.718 ...),\r\n\r\n    λ (lambda) = the decay rate of the radioactive material, expressed\r\n          in atoms decaying per atom per unit of time,\r\n\r\n    t = the time that has elapsed since the origin of system, expressed\r\n          in the same units.\r\n\r\nObviously, in ordinary computations that would not be enough information\r\nto calculate the time, because there still are two unknowns, _N₀_ and\r\n_t_. In a closed system, however, the atoms that have decayed do not\r\ndisappear into thin air. They merely change into other atoms, called\r\ndaughter atoms, and remain in the system.\r\n\r\nAnd at any point in time, there will be both PARENT and DAUGHTER atoms\r\nmixed together in the material. The older the material, the more\r\ndaughters and the fewer parents. Some daughters are also radioactive,\r\nbut this does not change the basic situation. Thus it follows that\r\n\r\n                               N₀ = N + D\r\n\r\nwhere D = the number of daughter (decayed) atoms. We may then substitute\r\ninto the first equation\r\n\r\n                          N = (N + D) e^{-λt}\r\n\r\nand solve\r\n\r\n                         t = 1/λ · ln(1 + D/N)\r\n\r\nwhere ln = the natural logarithm, the logarithm to base e.\r\n\r\nThis kind of system can be represented crudely by an old-fashioned\r\nhourglass, as shown in the figure, which has the parameters of these\r\nequations marked. (Keep in mind, however, that this is only a gross\r\nanalogy. Nuclear clocks run at logarithmically decreasing rates, but the\r\nspeed of a good hourglass is roughly constant.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _An hourglass illustrates an ideal closed system. Nothing\r\nis added and nothing is removed—the sand just runs from the top bulb to\r\nthe bottom._]\r\n\r\nRemember that the decaying nucleus does not disappear. It changes into\r\nanother nucleus, and this new nucleus forms an atom that may be captured\r\nand held fixed by natural processes. The decayed nuclei are thus\r\ncollected, so that here we have the bottom chamber of the hourglass.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes we need only the top chamber of an hourglass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE CARBON-14 CLOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nCarbon-14 decay is the best example of a top-only hourglass. Carbon-14\r\nis constantly being produced in the upper atmosphere from atoms of\r\nnitrogen-14 being struck by neutrons that had their origin in COSMIC\r\nRAYS. The reaction is written:\r\n\r\n                      ¹⁴N + neutron → ¹⁴C + proton\r\n\r\nRadioactive decay then follows, with a half-life of 5800 years[9] for\r\nthe ¹⁴C.\r\n\r\n                  ¹⁴C → ¹⁴N + electron (BETA PARTICLE)\r\n\r\nThe radiocarbon emits an electron and changes back into nitrogen.\r\n\r\nAs far as anyone can tell, ¹⁴C was produced at a constant rate above the\r\nearth for at least 50,000 years before the first atomic bomb was\r\nexploded. In other words, the ¹⁴C cycle is like an hourglass in which\r\nthe sand in the upper part is replenished as fast as it runs out through\r\nthe hole in the waist. A process of this sort, where production equals\r\ndecay, is called a SECULAR EQUILIBRIUM.\r\n\r\nThe newly produced ¹⁴C soon is evenly mixed with the carbon dioxide in\r\nthe air, is taken up by all living plants, and then finds its way into\r\nall living animals. In effect, all carbon in living organisms contains a\r\nconstant proportion of ¹⁴C. If any of this carbon is taken out of\r\ncirculation—when a tree branch is broken off, for instance, or when a\r\nshellfish dies in the ocean—no more new ¹⁴C is added to that particular\r\nsystem, but the old ¹⁴C continues to run out. In effect it now starts\r\nmeasuring time as an hourglass should.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _To illustrate secular equilibrium, one must imagine an\r\nhourglass in which the sand in the top bulb is continuously\r\nreplenished—as fast as it runs out through the hole in the waist and\r\ndisappears._]\r\n\r\nWhen we find a piece of charcoal in a cave or a piece of wood in some\r\nancient structure, for example, we can measure the amount of carbon in\r\nit, determine how much of it is ¹⁴C, and then calculate back to the time\r\nwhen the radioactivity from the ¹⁴C was the same as we now find in\r\nliving wood. In other words, if we assume that we know from the observed\r\nsecular equilibrium how much ¹⁴C originally was present in living\r\nmaterial, then we can calculate the time of death of any similar but\r\nancient material. That is the basis of the ¹⁴C method of age\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dinosaur tracks imprinted in rock in Navajo Canyon,\r\nArizona, arouse the professional interest of this scientist. Fossil\r\ntraces of extinct prehistoric creatures were for a long time the best\r\nclues to the age of rock formations._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A scientist using liquid nitrogen to freeze carbon\r\ndioxide gas made from a sample of ancient material that he is preparing\r\nfor age determination by the carbon-14 technique._]\r\n\r\nFor example, a bit of a rafter from a prehistoric cliff-dwelling or a\r\nremnant of charcoal from an ancient fire may be analyzed for its\r\nremaining ¹⁴C content, and its age determined accurately within the\r\nmargin of a few hundred years. This fixes the time at which the wood for\r\nthe rafter or the firewood was broken or cut from the living tree, and\r\nhence the period in which the men lived who used the wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The most useful samples for carbon-14 age determination\r\nare charcoal, wood, and shells._]\r\n\r\n\r\nCarbon-14 Counting\r\n\r\nCarbon-14 measurements are made by taking a known amount of carbon,\r\nreducing it to a gas, and then counting the ¹⁴C disintegrations in the\r\ngas. This may sound simple, but in reality the measurement process is a\r\nformidable undertaking, because the amount of the ¹⁴C isotope in the\r\ncarbon is so extremely small. (The remainder of the carbon, of course,\r\nconsists of other isotopes—¹²C or ¹³C, which are stable.)\r\n\r\nThere are two basic techniques. The carbon can be:\r\n\r\n  1. Burned with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, or\r\n\r\n  2. Reduced chemically to methane or ethane, or to a carbide from which\r\n  acetylene can be evolved by adding water. (See booklet cover and\r\n  description on page 59.)\r\n\r\nThe first technique is the simpler, but carbon dioxide (CO₂) contains\r\nonly one atom of carbon per molecule, whereas acetylene (C₂H₂) and\r\nethane (C₂H₆) each contain two. Consequently, the SPECIFIC ACTIVITY of\r\nacetylene or ethane is twice that of carbon dioxide, other things being\r\nequal. For that reason acetylene or ethane are the preferred gases in\r\nsome laboratories. On the other hand, they are explosive, and that\r\ncautions other scientists into using the carbon dioxide method.\r\n\r\nWhichever gas is used, it is first purified and then stored in a bottle\r\nfor a month or so. This storage allows for decay (disappearance) of any\r\nradon, the gaseous radioactive product of uranium decay. Uranium\r\ncontamination is difficult to avoid at the low radioactivity levels of\r\n¹⁴C, but the half-life of radon is only 3.82 days, so that it will decay\r\nto an insignificant level in a month. After the storage period, the gas\r\nis pumped into an array of instruments known as a low-background\r\nPROPORTIONAL COUNTER, and its radioactivity is determined. This is an\r\ninvolved process. First there is the matter of the BACKGROUND COUNT.\r\n\r\nThe background count of an instrument is the number of pulses (counts)\r\nit will give per unit time when there is _no_ radioactive sample in it.\r\nThese counts are caused by cosmic rays, by radioactive contamination\r\nalways found in the vicinity of the counter, or by any contamination\r\ninside the instrument. In ¹⁴C counting, all these sources of background\r\nmust be reduced to negligible levels. This is done in a number of ways.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, the whole assembly is constructed with surrounding walls\r\nof lead or iron more than a foot thick. Such a shield will stop all the\r\nGAMMA RAYS coming from radioactive contamination in the laboratory and\r\nmuch of the cosmic radiation; high-energy cosmic rays and all neutrons\r\nstill will get through. Therefore, there is an ANTICOINCIDENCE RING\r\ninside the lead shield. This is a cylindrical space completely\r\nsurrounded by GEIGER COUNTERS that are connected to each other and to\r\nthe SAMPLE COUNTER in the middle. With this arrangement, when the sample\r\ncounter and any ring counter discharge simultaneously, it is a signal\r\nthat the pulse triggering this response was caused by some energetic\r\nparticles, such as a cosmic ray, passing through the whole assembly. A\r\npulse recorded simultaneously on two counters is automatically rejected\r\nfrom the counting mechanisms. Some instruments have been designed with a\r\ncylinder of paraffin immediately inside the anticoincidence ring, to\r\nslow down neutrons so that they can be captured, and with a final shield\r\nof highly purified mercury between two cylinders of selected steel to\r\nhold out even more unwanted radiation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A carbon-14 counter. Sketch (above) shows arrangement of\r\ncomponents in photo (left)._]\r\n\r\nFinally, the sample counters are made of specially selected metal tubing\r\nthat is extremely low in radioactive content, with a fine wire stretched\r\ndown the middle. (In some recent designs, the anticoincidence ring and\r\nsample counter are combined in a single cylindrical housing with a thin\r\nfoil of metallized plastic between them.) A thin glass filling tube\r\nconnects the sample counter with the outside world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Detail of one type of sample-counting tube for carbon-14\r\nwork. Carbon-14 in benzene gas molecules is placed in the central cell\r\nand mixed with a fluid that scintillates, or emits light flashes, when\r\nexposed to radiation. Photomultiplier tubes convert the flashes to\r\nelectric signals._]\r\n\r\nThe radiocarbon-bearing gas is pumped into the sample counter through\r\nthe filling tube, and all the counts resulting from its disintegrations\r\nare recorded electronically. The age of the sample is calculated from\r\nthe NET COUNTING RATE (the sample counting rate minus the background);\r\nthe lower the counting rate the higher the age. The upper limit of the\r\nage that can be measured is determined by the STATISTICAL ERROR (that\r\nis, by the measure of the instrument accuracy) in the net count. In very\r\nold samples this error may be great enough so that the calculated age of\r\nthe sample may have little or no meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarbon-14 Results\r\n\r\nOBJECTS DATED BY RADIOCARBON\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hair of an Egyptian woman. 5020 ± 290 years old._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Linen wrapping from the Dead Sea Scroll containing the\r\nBook of Isaiah. 1917 ± 200 years old._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Peruvian rope. 2632 ± 200 years old._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Preglacial wood found in Ohio.

One of a\r\npair of 300 pairs found in this cave. 9035 ± 325 years old._]\r\n\r\nCarbon-14 is by far the most widely used method of measuring geologic\r\ntime. It has become the mainstay of archeology and geology for studies\r\nof events of the past 50,000 years or so, and also has wide applications\r\nin climatology, ecology, and geography. It would be difficult to pick\r\nout the most significant example of the use of this method, but one\r\nimportant contribution has been in study of the early inhabitants of\r\nNorth America. With the aid of ¹⁴C it has been possible to date human\r\nliving sites from many points in the western United States. The first\r\nappearance of these sites, about 11,500 years ago, apparently coincided\r\nwith the time when a land bridge was open from Asia to America over what\r\nis now the Bering Strait. An ice-free passage extended from this bridge\r\nthrough present-day Alaska and western Canada to the United States. This\r\nmay have been the route taken by the first immigrants to America—a\r\npopulation of mammoth-hunters, who made the characteristic flint\r\n_Clovis_ arrow and spear points.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Clovis arrow point chipped from flint by the earliest\r\nmen on the American continent. The photograph is actual size._]\r\n\r\nBy about 11,000 years ago, these Clovis people had spread across the\r\narea of the United States and into Mexico. It may have been they who\r\nkilled off the mammoths and then gradually assumed the characteristics\r\nof the _Folsom_ culture. The Folsom people were bison-hunters, and long\r\nwere thought to have been the first population in America. It was with\r\nthe use of ¹⁴C that it finally was possible to place these two cultures\r\nin proper sequence—the Clovis first—and to correlate them with major\r\nnatural changes, especially the advance and retreat of glaciers across\r\nthe continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE LONG-LIVED CLOCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nAll other practical age-determination schemes are based on a few\r\nlong-lived isotopes, with half-lives relatively near the age of the\r\nearth (4.5 AEONS). They are:\r\n\r\n                                  Table III\r\n  Isotope           Emits                  Decays to      Half-life\r\n  Uranium-238       8 ALPHA PARTICLES[10]  Lead-206       4.51 aeons\r\n  Uranium-238       Spontaneous fission    2 Fragments    10 million\r\n                                                          aeons[11]\r\n  Uranium-235       7 Alpha particles      Lead-207       0.713 aeons\r\n  Thorium-232       6 Alpha particles      Lead-208       14.1 aeons\r\n  Rubidium-87       Beta particle          Strontium-87   4.7 aeons\r\n  Potassium-40      Electron capture       Argon-40       1.3 aeons\r\n  ......            ......                 ......         ......\r\n  Rhenium-187[12]   Beta particle          Osmium-187     40 aeons\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that Table II on page 6, showing the long-lived\r\nradioactive nuclides, is much longer than the list of the seven shown\r\nhere that are actually useful in practice. Some of the nuclides that are\r\ntheoretically available are useless on a practical basis, because they\r\nare so rare in nature. Many others cannot be used for reasons that are\r\nfundamental to the whole process of nuclear age determination by “whole\r\nhourglass” (that is, parent-daughter) methods. Let’s look at these\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nThese methods are based on closed systems in which the daughter products\r\nof the radioactive decay are locked with the parent material from the\r\nbeginning of the system, and nothing is added or removed thereafter. To\r\nstate it in terms of our analogy, the hourglass must be in perfect\r\nworking order—no leaks or cracks permitted.\r\n\r\nThere is another fundamental requirement: At the beginning, the bottom\r\npart of the hourglass must be empty. If some sand were already in the\r\nbottom at the start, we would mistakenly be led to conclude that the\r\ntime elapsed was longer than it actually was. That necessity places a\r\nsevere limitation on the type of system we can use.\r\n\r\nConsider, for example, the decay of potassium-40 into calcium-40.\r\nMeasuring this process is perfectly suitable from the point of view of\r\nhalf-life, but the daughter product is identical with the most common\r\nisotope of ordinary calcium. And calcium is present everywhere in\r\nnature! Even the purest mineral of potassium, sylvite (the salt,\r\npotassium chloride), contains so much calcium impurity that the\r\nRADIOGENIC daughter calcium, produced by the decay of potassium in\r\ngeologic time, is negligible in comparison. We can say that the bottom\r\nof this potassium-40 hourglass has been stuffed with so much sand from\r\nthe very beginning that the few grains that fall through the waist are\r\nlost in the overall mass. This demonstrates that schemes involving the\r\ndecay of a relatively rare nuclide into a relatively common one are not\r\nusable. Natural geochemical separations of elements are never perfect,\r\nanyway.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the decay of any of the RARE EARTH elements into other rare\r\nearth elements is not particularly helpful, because the rare earths are\r\nso similar chemically they tend to travel together when they move in\r\nnature.[13] Wherever the parent isotope goes, the daughter tags along.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rubidium-Strontium Clock\r\n\r\nThe decay of rubidium-87 (⁸⁷Rb) into strontium-87 (⁸⁷Sr) is perhaps the\r\nmost useful scheme for geologic age determination. The same problem\r\nshows up here, but at least there is a way out of the wilderness. It is\r\nnot exactly simple, but a consideration of it is fundamental to\r\nunderstanding the process of nuclear dating. The figure shows patterns\r\nfrom mass spectrometer charts; each peak represents an isotope of\r\nstrontium, and the height of every peak is proportional to the relative\r\nabundance of that isotope. In the figure, A shows the mass-spectrum of a\r\nrock or mineral containing COMMON strontium (which is a mixture of\r\nseveral isotopes). The peak of ⁸⁷Sr is small compared to the others. B\r\nshows the mass-spectrum of strontium from an old rubidium-rich mineral\r\nCRYSTAL, drawn to the same scale, as far as the nonradiogenic isotopes,\r\n⁸⁴Sr, ⁸⁶Sr, and ⁸⁸Sr, are concerned. The ⁸⁷Sr peak in this spectrum is\r\nobviously larger than in the common strontium in A. This is because this\r\nisotope is radiogenic and has been accumulating from the decay of\r\nrubidium since this crystal was formed.\r\n\r\nThe question we must answer is: How much of this ⁸⁷Sr was formed from\r\n⁸⁷Rb decay and how much originally was present in the crystal as an\r\nimpurity? If the amount of this ORIGINAL strontium is not too large, the\r\nproblem can be solved by simple arithmetic.\r\n\r\nFirst, we must find a good sample of common strontium—that is, ordinary\r\nstrontium, the kind shown at left in the figure. We cannot require that\r\nthis strontium be entirely uncontaminated by radiogenic strontium,\r\nbecause all strontium is more or less contaminated. What we need is\r\nstrontium contaminated to _just the same extent_ as the strontium that\r\nwas taken as an impurity into the closed system when it first formed. In\r\ngeological specimens such a material is usually available.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Drawings of mass-spectrometer charts showing the\r\nisotopic spectra of two kinds of strontium: (A) common strontium and (B)\r\nstrontium from an old mineral rich in rubidium._ (_See page 32 for photo\r\nof a mass spectrometer._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Rubidium-87 and strontium-87 fall on the same spot in\r\nthe mass spectrum. Therefore, rubidium must be separated chemically from\r\nstrontium before the strontium can be analyzed in a mass spectrometer.\r\nIt is done with ion-exchange columns. Four of them are shown in this\r\nphotograph. The author of this booklet is adding a sample, dissolved in\r\na few drops of hydrochloric acid, to the second column._]\r\n\r\nLet us take as our closed system a mica crystal in a mass of granite.\r\nMica contains a fair amount of rubidium, and it retains its radiogenic\r\nstrontium very well. Furthermore, mica crystals are often associated or\r\neven intergrown with the slender, rod-shaped crystals of a mineral\r\ncalled apatite—a phosphate of calcium. It is justifiable, on the basis\r\nof geological knowledge, to say that the mica and the apatite grew at\r\nroughly the same time and thus presumably from the same liquid medium\r\nthat became granite when it later solidified. Now strontium is\r\ngeochemically similar to calcium, and some strontium will have gone into\r\nthe apatite crystal in place of calcium. Apatite contains no\r\nalkalis—hence apatite will have virtually no rubidium (which is an\r\nalkali) in it to contaminate the ⁸⁷Sr. Consequently, when we find\r\napatite in an old granite, we know the apatite will still contain the\r\nkind of common strontium that was taken into the mica crystal when it\r\ngrew originally.\r\n\r\nWe can separate the apatite from the granite by standard mineralogical\r\ntechniques, extract the strontium from the apatite chemically, and\r\nanalyze it on a mass spectrometer to obtain the isotopic spectrum—the\r\nrelative amount of each isotope that is present. We can then perform the\r\nsame isotopic analysis on the strontium extracted from the mica, and\r\nsubtract the original (apatite) strontium from the total (mica)\r\nstrontium, to obtain the radiogenic component or daughter product. (See\r\npage 32 for details of this method.)\r\n\r\nObviously, there is a certain error associated with every isotopic\r\nanalysis, so such a calculation is meaningful only when the radiogenic\r\ncomponent is large compared with the error in the measurement of\r\nisotopic abundance. When one large quantity must be subtracted from\r\nanother large quantity to obtain a small difference, there is an obvious\r\nlimit to how much one can trust the result. The absolute accuracy in\r\nmeasuring strontium isotope abundance is a few tenths of 1%, using the\r\nbest mass spectrometers now available. In practice, one can trust a\r\ncalculated age for a specimen only when the ⁸⁷Sr is as little as about\r\n5% radiogenic. The results do not mean much when only 1 or 2% is\r\nradiogenic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A sample of granite being made ready for crushing and\r\nmineral separation._]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Uranium Fission Clock\r\n\r\nWhen a neutron strikes the nucleus of uranium-235 (²³⁵U) or\r\nplutonium-239 (²³⁹Pu), it may cause the nucleus to split into two\r\nroughly equal fragments, releasing neutrons and energy. This is the\r\nwell-known process of neutron-induced fission, the method in which\r\nnuclear energy is produced in both reactors and bombs.[14] The most\r\ncommon uranium isotope, ²³⁸U, also breaks up by fission, but does so all\r\nby itself, without the need for any external neutrons. That process is\r\n_spontaneous fission_ and it goes on at random, very much like\r\nradioactive decay. It is a relatively rare process and the fission\r\nhalf-life is long—about 10 million aeons (10¹⁶ years). That means that\r\nonly about one spontaneous fission occurs in uranium-238 for every 2\r\nmillion alpha decays. That is enough to make a useful clock, however,\r\nbecause ²³⁸U is present almost everywhere. (See Table III on page 19.)\r\n\r\nImagine an atom of ²³⁸U in some mineral. When the atom suddenly\r\nfissions, it breaks in two with considerable energy, and the two fission\r\nfragments rip like cannon balls through the surrounding crystalline\r\nstructure in opposite directions, creating havoc along the way. They\r\ntravel a distance something like 10 microns (4 millionths of an inch)\r\nbefore they are finally slowed down and stopped by all their collisions\r\nwith other atoms. Each fragment’s path remains behind as an intensely\r\ndamaged tube through the crystal.\r\n\r\nThe process was known for a long time before anyone was able to find\r\nthese fission tracks (the damaged tubes) in the crystals. Finally, about\r\n1960, three young physicists, R. L. Fleischer, P. B. Price, and R. M.\r\nWalker, working at the General Electric Research Laboratory, fell upon\r\nthe idea of etching freshly broken surfaces of crystals with acid. They\r\nreasoned that a region so intensely disturbed by the passage of a\r\nfission fragment should be etched more easily and deeply than the\r\nundisturbed surrounding crystal. That idea turned out to be correct, and\r\nfission tracks have now been found in almost every common mineral (since\r\nalmost all minerals contain small amounts of uranium).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Tracks of uranium fission from a fossil antelope bone\r\nfragment from Hopefield, Cape Province, South Africa._]\r\n\r\nThe fission clock method works this way: A cleavage face or a polished\r\nsurface of a crystal or glass fragment is etched with a suitable\r\nsolvent. Different acids work best for different materials, and a\r\nsuitable procedure must be developed especially for each substance. The\r\netching brings out the fission tracks so they can be seen (usually as\r\nlittle conical pits) and counted under a microscope.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the sample is exposed to a known amount of slow neutrons[15]\r\nin a nuclear reactor. New fissions are produced, but this time only in\r\n²³⁵U (which is present in all natural uranium in the proportion of 1\r\natom of ²³⁵U to 137.7 atoms of ²³⁸U), because slow neutrons do not\r\nproduce fissions in ²³⁸U. After the neutron irradiation, the same\r\nsurface is etched again, and the new tracks counted. The old tracks,\r\nhaving been etched twice, now appear larger and thus can be\r\ndistinguished from the new ones that were caused by ²³⁵U fission.\r\n\r\nThe rate at which ²³⁸U decays by fission, λ_{f}, is known, as are the\r\nrate it decays by alpha decay, λ_{α}, and the total number of slow\r\nneutrons, _n_, to which the sample was exposed in the reactor. The age\r\nof the crystal or glass can then be calculated:\r\n\r\n         t = (1)/(λ_{α}) ln (1 + (_n_N_{s})/(N_{i}) × constant)\r\n\r\n  where\r\n\r\n    ln = the natural logarithm (log to the base _e_),\r\n\r\n    N_{s} = the number of atoms in the sample.\r\n\r\n    N_{i} = the number of atoms of ²³⁵U in the irradiated sample,\r\n\r\nand the constant has the value:\r\n\r\n         ½ (λ_{α} × 582 × 10⁻²⁴)/(λ_{f} × 137.7) = 4.25 × 10⁻¹⁸\r\n\r\nFission-track dating is a brand new technique, still only partly\r\ndeveloped. It has enormous range and is applicable to numerous minerals;\r\nthese advantages imply that it is likely to become very useful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _An atomic absorption spectrophotometer is used to\r\nmeasure the amount of potassium in samples of mica dissolved in acid._]\r\n\r\n\r\nPlumbology\r\n\r\nThe most complicated and therefore probably the most interesting decay\r\nscheme of all is the decay of uranium to lead, discovered well over half\r\na century ago and still intensively studied. There are several reasons\r\nfor the interest.\r\n\r\nFirst, uranium and lead are geochemically separated to a high degree,\r\nnot only on the small scale of an ore deposit but also on the scale of\r\nthe earth as a whole. Second, natural uranium has two isotopes with\r\nhalf-lives that are neither too long nor too short to be useful (the\r\ngreater half-life almost exactly equaling the age of the earth), and\r\nthese half-lives differ from each other by a factor of about 6.3. That\r\nleads to very important consequences, as we shall see. Third, uranium\r\nand lead are both common, and techniques are available for extracting\r\nthem in measurable quantities from almost any natural material.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of these happy circumstances, the study of uranium and\r\nlead has contributed a great deal to understanding the earth’s history\r\nand the processes that go on inside it. F. G. Houtermans, one of the\r\ngreat pioneers in this study, jokingly called the method PLUMBOLOGY, and\r\nit seems a useful name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE AGE OF THE EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest achievement of the “plumbologists” has been the calculation\r\nof the age of the earth, first proposed by Houtermans, a German\r\nphysicist, and independently by Arthur Holmes, a British geologist, in\r\n1946 and finally perfected by C. C. Patterson in 1953. It is actually a\r\nrather simple calculation, although the way to discovering it was far\r\nfrom easy. Before we look at it in detail, however, let’s consider some\r\nbasic assumptions and explain what is meant by “the age of the earth”.\r\n\r\nFrom studying the mechanics of the solar system, scientists have become\r\nreasonably certain that the earth and the other planets and their\r\nsatellites all were formed in a common process in a relatively short\r\nperiod of time, geologically speaking. Perhaps it took a dozen million\r\nyears or so, but compared to the time that has elapsed since, that is a\r\ntwinkling. At some time soon afterwards, the earth became molten, or at\r\nany rate fluid enough to allow much of its iron to settle toward the\r\ncenter to form the earth’s core. Similar cores presumably formed in\r\nother planets. As the iron went down, it took some lead with it, and as\r\nthe silica went up, uranium followed it toward the surface, because of\r\nthe chemical affinity between these kinds of elements. In the present\r\nearth, we have found, almost all the uranium is concentrated in the top\r\nlayer, or crust, which is only about 25 miles thick under the continents\r\nand even thinner under the oceans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Internal structure of the earth. The central core is\r\nprobably an alloy of iron and nickel, surrounded by a mantle of less\r\ndense silicate material, with a thin crust of still lighter silicates._]\r\n\r\nThe time of this early and relatively rapid separation of uranium and\r\nlead on a worldwide scale is the event that plumbologists can determine,\r\nand the period since then is what they mean by “the age of the earth”.\r\nWhen Houtermans first wrote about it, he called it “the age of uranium”.\r\n\r\nHow is this done? We have said that one of the isotopes of uranium,\r\n²³⁵U, decays faster—about 6.3 times faster—than the other, ²³⁸U. They\r\ndecay into two different isotopes of lead. Therefore, if we can\r\ndetermine the isotopic composition of average ordinary lead in the\r\nearth’s crust today, and if we can somehow obtain a sample of the kind\r\nof lead that is locked in the earth’s core, we can calculate how long it\r\ntook to change the PRIMORDIAL lead (like that in the core) into\r\npresent-day lead in the crust by the gradual addition of radiogenic\r\nlead—lead that has resulted from the decay of uranium. Now, someone\r\nmight logically ask, “Isn’t it necessary to know also the actual amount\r\nof uranium involved in the process, and isn’t this difficult to\r\ndetermine?” It turns out to be a remarkable aspect of the\r\nHolmes-Houtermans calculation that the uranium-concentration terms\r\ncancel out in the equations and only the _ratio_ of the isotopes and\r\ntheir decay constants need be considered. These are all known\r\naccurately.\r\n\r\nNext, we must decide just what is average present-day lead? It isn’t\r\nenough to go to a lead mine and get a sample, because, unfortunately,\r\nleads from different mines have widely varied isotopic composition—that\r\nis, a different mixture of four natural isotopes, ²⁰⁴Pb, ²⁰⁶Pb, ²⁰⁷Pb,\r\nand ²⁰⁸Pb—as a result of their geologic histories. No, lead samples from\r\na mine won’t do. However, geologists have been able to separate lead\r\nfrom recent marine sediments, obtained from the ocean bottom, far from\r\nland. These are of uniform composition, and are good samples of what the\r\nworld’s rivers bring into the ocean. Other useful samples can be found\r\nin plateau basalts, which are enormous bodies of dark volcanic rock that\r\nmake up the bedrock in many parts of the world. The lead from these\r\nbasalts is isotopically very much like the lead in the oceans.\r\n\r\nVery well, but how about the lead from the core? Where can we hope to\r\nfind a sample of it? It turns out to be easier than you might think.\r\nAstronomers believe it highly probable that most meteorites are\r\nfragments of a former planet that broke up for reasons that are not\r\nentirely clear. It is pretty definite, however, that this protoplanet\r\n(or these protoplanets, for there may have been more than one) had an\r\niron core, and this core (or these cores) is the source of the iron\r\nmeteorites sailing around in space. A large meteorite hit the earth not\r\ntoo long ago (geologically speaking) and caused the Meteor Crater near\r\nCanyon Diablo in Arizona.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Examining ocean-bottom sediments obtained by lowering a\r\ntube-like instrument that brings up a long rod-shaped “core”, prior to\r\nnuclear age determination of the sample._]\r\n\r\nMany fragments of the meteorite iron have been found around the crater,\r\nand it is reasonable to assume that this is the kind of iron we would\r\nexpect to find in the core of the earth. Like the core iron, it is mixed\r\nwith a little lead, which can be isolated and analyzed in a mass\r\nspectrometer for its isotopic composition. This lead is found to be much\r\nless contaminated with radiogenic lead, and hence is much more primitive\r\nthan the oldest leads found on earth. Thus, meteorites presumably are as\r\nclose as we can get to true primordial lead—the lead of the time when\r\nthe earth (and the protoplanet) first formed.\r\n\r\nOnce these measurements were available, it was easy to write the\r\nHoutermans equation for present-day and primordial leads in this way:\r\n\r\n         ((²⁰⁶Pb)/(²⁰⁴Pb)) present - ((²⁰⁶Pb)/(²⁰⁴Pb)) primordial\r\n         ------------------------   --------------------------\r\n         ((²⁰⁷Pb)/(²⁰⁴Pb)) present - ((²⁰⁷Pb)/(²⁰⁴Pb)) primordial\r\n\r\n           = 137.7 ((e^{λ}238^{t} - 1))/((e^{λ}235^{t} - 1))\r\n\r\nThe present ratio of ²³⁸U to ²³⁵U is 137.7.\r\n\r\n    e = the base of natural logarithms\r\n\r\n    λ = the DECAY CONSTANT of each isotope of uranium\r\n\r\n    t = the age of the earth.\r\n\r\nSubstituting the best experimental lead isotope ratios into the equation\r\nand solving for t, Patterson was able to calculate that the earth is\r\n4550 million years (4.55 aeons) old. Subsequent calculations based on\r\nother procedures generally have confirmed that result.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalytical Techniques\r\n\r\nEach method of nuclear age determination involves a different sequence\r\nof sample preparation. Wood, peat, charcoal, bones, or shells are\r\ncleaned for carbon-14 dating in order to remove every trace of possible\r\ncontamination by modern carbon as well as extraneous old carbon. Rocks\r\nare crushed and ground, minerals are separated according to what is\r\nneeded in any particular study, and the desired elements are extracted\r\nand separated by chemical procedures. Often there may be several\r\ndifferent ways of doing the same thing; different laboratories use\r\ndifferent procedures. In every case, however, long and complicated\r\nprocedures must be followed before results are obtained from which an\r\nage can be calculated. There is no such thing as a black box into which\r\nyou can throw a rock and read its age on a dial!\r\n\r\nOf all the elements that are part of the useful parent-daughter systems,\r\nonly potassium is common enough to be analyzed by conventional chemical\r\ntechniques. All the other elements, especially the radiogenic ones, are\r\npresent in such small quantities that special processes had to be\r\ndeveloped to measure them. The most valuable and generally used process\r\nis called ISOTOPE DILUTION.\r\n\r\nIsotope Dilution\r\n\r\nThis is a process for analyzing an unknown material by incorporating\r\nuniformly into it a small amount of a radioactive test substance and\r\ndetermining how much the tracer radioactivity is altered by dilution in\r\nthe original material.\r\n\r\nIt works like this: Let’s say that we have an unknown number of atoms,\r\n_x_, of a given element. The normal isotopic composition of this element\r\nis accurately known, as it is for most elements, and the ratio of two of\r\nits isotopes can be expressed as A/B. We now add to _x_ a known (but\r\nusually smaller) amount, _c_, of the same element. This quantity has a\r\ndrastically different isotopic ratio, A′/B′. We mix _x_ and _c_\r\nthoroughly together. The ratio A′/B′ can have almost any value, but must\r\nbe different from A/B and we must know exactly what it is. (There are\r\nmany ways of determining this chemically, or we can use a sample isotope\r\nof known composition obtained from the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission’s\r\nOak Ridge National Laboratory at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.) The substance\r\nadded is known colloquially as the SPIKE.\r\n\r\nAfter the original material and the spike are thoroughly mixed we have:\r\n\r\n               _x_(A/B) + _c_(A′/B′) = (_x_ + _c_) (A″B″)\r\n\r\nin which A″/B″ will be the ratio of the two isotopes in the mixture.\r\nWith this information in hand, we can perform any chemical purification\r\nor transfer process with the material (see photo on page 22), without\r\nhaving to worry about loss. (Even if 90% of the material should be lost\r\nin some operation, the isotopic composition would not be changed, and\r\nthat is all we are interested in.) Now we can place the material\r\ncontaining the isotopic mixture in a MASS SPECTROMETER, which will\r\ndetermine the ratio A″/B″. When we have that, we may substitute the\r\nvalue of A″/B″ in the equation and quickly calculate _x_, the unknown\r\nconcentration of atoms in the original sample.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A large (12-inch) mass spectrometer (at left) in use.\r\nElectronic equipment (right) charts results (see page 21)._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Essential parts of a mass spectrometer. Atoms to be\r\nanalyzed are changed to ions in the source. Then the ions are\r\naccelerated by high voltage, deflected in a magnetic field according to\r\ntheir mass, and the intensity of the separated beams is measured in the\r\ncollector._]\r\n\r\nMass Spectrometry\r\n\r\nThe mass spectrometer measures isotopic abundances using a magnetic\r\nfield to sort electrically charged particles into groups according to\r\ntheir masses. It works this way: A small drop of material to be analyzed\r\nis placed on a metal filament and dried. The filament, in its holder, is\r\nplaced inside the mass spectrometer, and heated electrically in a\r\nvacuum, like the filament in a light bulb. As the wire begins to glow,\r\nsome of the sample begins to radiate, or “boil off”, losing an electron\r\nor two in the process. In other words, some of the atoms will be changed\r\ninto positive IONS.\r\n\r\nAn alternative method is to introduce the sample material into the\r\nvacuum chamber in the form of a gas (like argon, for example), and then\r\nbombard the gas with electrons streaming from a hot filament. The\r\nelectron stream will knock some electrons off the gas molecules and this\r\nalso will produce positive ions. Either process of ion production is\r\nsatisfactory, depending on the problem to be tackled, but the mass\r\nspectrometers for the two methods are naturally quite different.\r\n\r\nWhichever way the ions were produced, they are next exposed to a strong\r\nelectric field, accelerated, and electrostatically focused into a beam.\r\nThese charged particles are directed into a magnetic field between the\r\npole faces of an electromagnet. The magnet does the analyzing by the\r\nprinciple of magnetic deflection that was known to André Ampere and\r\nMichael Faraday more than a century ago. Any moving electric charge has\r\na magnetic field associated with it. This field interacts with the field\r\nof the analyzing magnet to impress a deflecting force on the charge. The\r\nforce acts at right angles to the direction the charge travels and also\r\nat right angles to the direction of the impressed magnetic field. The\r\npull of this force depends only on the electric charge and the speed of\r\neach particle: A light single-charged particle will be deflected more\r\nthan a heavier particle with the same charge. In this way, the ions in\r\nthe beam are sorted out into a number of separate beams, each made up of\r\nparticles of the same charge/mass ratio. Each beam contains one isotope\r\nof the original material, because isotopes differ on the basis of their\r\nmass. By adjusting the current in the electromagnet we can direct these\r\nseparate beams into a “collector” and electrically measure their\r\nintensity one by one. This gives the relative abundance of the separate\r\nisotopes in the sample.\r\n\r\n\r\nMinerals That Can Be Dated\r\n\r\nMeasuring age by one of the long-lived radioisotopes requires a closed\r\nsystem. Usually this is some kind of crystal formed in a period of time\r\nthat is short, compared to the time that has elapsed since, and that has\r\nremained unchanged since it formed. Specifically, neither the parent\r\nisotopes can have been added nor the daughter isotopes removed by any\r\nprocess other than radioactive decay.\r\n\r\nThe earth is a dynamic system, however. Things are always changing and\r\nmoving—not very rapidly, perhaps, but fast enough, in geologic time, to\r\nraise mountains and shift oceans. Solutions are moving around,\r\ndissolving something here and depositing it again somewhere else.\r\nTemperatures are changing as one place is denuded by erosion and another\r\narea buried under layers of sediment. Under such conditions, few systems\r\nremain closed. It is perhaps surprising that we find any closed systems\r\nat all. Let us look at a few that are known to be reliable. (They are\r\nlisted in Table I on page 4.)\r\n\r\nPotash Feldspar\r\n\r\nIn the early 1950s, when the potassium-argon (parent-daughter) method\r\nwas being developed by scientists at the University of Chicago, it was\r\nthought that the potash-bearing variety of the mineral feldspar would be\r\nan ideal closed system, because it was usually optically clear and free\r\nof flaws. This widely shared, logical, and perfectly scientific\r\ndeduction soon turned out to be quite wrong. The scientific workers\r\ndiscovered that when feldspar and mica from the same rock (and thus of\r\nthe same age) were analyzed side by side, the mica always came out\r\nolder! Investigation showed that feldspar “leaked” argon (lost some of\r\nits radiogenic argon) even at room temperature, but the mica retained\r\nall or nearly all of the argon that had been generated in it.\r\n\r\nMica\r\n\r\nWith the development of the rubidium-strontium (parent-daughter) method\r\nby L. T. Aldrich and his co-workers at the Carnegie Institution of\r\nWashington, came the realization that mica was also very useful for this\r\nanalysis, for it usually contains ample rubidium and not much original\r\nstrontium that would mask the presence of the radiogenic strontium. As a\r\nresult, mica, especially black mica (the mineral biotite), has enjoyed\r\ngreat popularity as a good and easy-to-find closed system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A scientist making adjustments on an “argon train”, a\r\nmaze of glass tubing in which argon is released from minerals and\r\npurified for analysis._]\r\n\r\nEverything has its limits, and mica is no exception: Even mica tends to\r\nleak argon at elevated, but still relatively low (geologically\r\nspeaking), temperatures. These effects also depend on pressure and other\r\nfactors, not all of which are well known; these elevated temperatures,\r\npressures and other conditions of course act to some extent on all rocks\r\nburied in the earth’s crust. It is known that at only about 300°C at\r\nmoderate pressures argon is leaked from mica faster than it is being\r\ngenerated in it by the decay of radioactive potassium. The temperature\r\nneeded to cause the rapid loss of strontium from mica is not much\r\nhigher. Mica, especially biotite, will recrystallize and lose all its\r\nradiogenic constituents (argon and strontium) at temperatures where many\r\nother minerals show little or no change.\r\n\r\nThat means that we cannot always rely on mica to give the date of the\r\n_original_ crystallization of a rock—the time when it cooled from a\r\nmolten state. Instead, mica will tell us when the rock _last_ cooled\r\nfrom, say, several hundred degrees centigrade, regardless of what may\r\nhave happened to the rock before that. The mica may have been reheated\r\nas a result of being buried under a few miles of sediment, for example.\r\nThe mica will show when the rock last cooled—in other words, when it\r\ncame up again.\r\n\r\nLow-Strontium Feldspar\r\n\r\nIn spite of early disappointments with potash feldspar for argon dating,\r\nsome of it is useful for rubidium-strontium procedures. It all depends\r\non how much original strontium the potash feldspar contains. Most\r\nfeldspars, unfortunately, contain far too much, but rapid screening by\r\nX-ray fluorescence or flame photometry methods can weed these out and\r\nidentify specimens low enough in original strontium to be useful.\r\nOtherwise, feldspar is an excellent closed system for rubidium and\r\nstrontium; it remains closed even at temperatures high enough to melt\r\nmany other minerals. It is not affected at all by the same degree of\r\nheating that will drive argon out of biotite. The rubidium-strontium age\r\nof feldspar usually comes close to the time of original crystallization\r\nof the rock.\r\n\r\nObviously, here is a geologically important tool. If we find feldspar\r\nand biotite in one rock, and if feldspar, tested by the\r\nrubidium-strontium method gives the same age as biotite tested by\r\npotassium-argon decay, then we can say with confidence that the rock has\r\nnot been reheated since shortly after it crystallized. Conversely, if\r\nthe biotite comes out much younger than the feldspar, we can be sure\r\nthat something _has_ happened to this rock long after it first\r\ncrystallized. Such information is not only valuable to pure science—it\r\ncan also be useful in locating areas favorable for ore prospecting and\r\nin other practical ways.\r\n\r\nZircon\r\n\r\nAnother very interesting mineral is zircon (a silicate of zirconium),\r\none of the accessory minerals found in small quantities in many\r\ncrystalline rocks. Zircon usually occurs in very small grains and is\r\nheavy and hard, so that it can be separated from the other rock without\r\nmuch difficulty, even though it may take 100 pounds of rock to supply a\r\ngram of zircon.\r\n\r\nZircon usually contains a fair amount of uranium and very little lead.\r\nIt holds radiogenically produced lead well, even at relatively high\r\ntemperatures. But that is not all. Even if some of the lead is lost,\r\nthere is a mathematical way of correcting for it. This technique is\r\ncalled CONCORDIA ANALYSIS and was developed by G. W. Wetherill, a\r\nphysicist then at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. It is based,\r\nagain, on the fact that natural uranium has two long-lived isotopes—²³⁸U\r\nand ²³⁵U—and that the lighter one, ²³⁵U, decays faster than the heavier.\r\nThe daughter products of both uranium decay processes are isotopes of\r\nthe same element, lead—²⁰⁸Pb and ²⁰⁷Pb, respectively. Heavy isotopes are\r\nnot separated to any significant degree by chemical processes, so that\r\nif radiogenic lead has been lost from a system for any reason, the other\r\nlead isotopes also will have been lost in whatever proportion they were\r\npresent originally.\r\n\r\nIf we plot a graph of the radiogenic ²⁰⁶Pb/²³⁸U ratio against the\r\nradiogenic ²⁰⁷Pb/²³⁵U ratio for concordant (closed) systems _of all\r\nages_, we obtain the curved line shown in the figure below. The curve is\r\nthe locus of _all_ concordant U-Pb ages and is called _Concordia_. Then\r\nif we test two or more particular zircons of the same age that have lost\r\ndifferent amounts of lead, at about the same time, the plot of their\r\n²⁰⁶Pb/²³⁸U ratios against their ²⁰⁷Pb/²³⁵U ratios will fall on a\r\nstraight line that is a chord of the Concordia curve. The upper\r\nintersection of this chord with the curve then will mark the true age of\r\nthe zircons. This is an elaborate technique utilizing difficult chemical\r\nprocedures, but it has proved invaluable in solving some important\r\ngeologic problems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Concordia curve offers a useful way of analyzing\r\nresults of age determinations on the mineral zircon._]\r\n\r\nHornblende\r\n\r\nThe mineral hornblende provides another useful system. Hornblende is a\r\ncomplex silicate of sodium, calcium, iron, magnesium, and aluminum, and\r\nusually contains a few tenths of 1% of potassium. It is unusual in that\r\nit tenaciously retains its radiogenic argon, even at relatively high\r\ntemperatures.\r\n\r\nSanidine\r\n\r\nStill another good system is the rare feldspar, sanidine, which is\r\nexcellent for both potassium-argon and rubidium-strontium age\r\ndetermination. Sanidine usually is found in volcanic ash falls and has\r\nbeen important in the establishment of the geologic time scale, as we\r\nshall see.\r\n\r\nWhole Rocks\r\n\r\nFinally there is still another way of obtaining a closed system by using\r\nthe whole rock, not just a crystal of a single mineral within it. A\r\nlarge body of granite or similar rock may contain a number of minerals,\r\nsome or none of which may be closed systems. Yet as long as this body of\r\nrock remains impermeable to solutions (which in nature means mostly to\r\nwater), no substance will be able to move very far in it because\r\ndiffusion in solids is so slow. Consequently it will remain a closed\r\nsystem, as a whole, regardless of what happens to the individual mineral\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nIf we take a piece from near the middle of this body of rock and if this\r\npiece is much larger than the largest constituent grain in it, then we\r\nhave a fair sample of a closed system—the whole rock. The only\r\ndifficulty arises from the fact that few rocks are sufficiently\r\nimpermeable to solutions to retain argon, and many rocks contain so much\r\ncommon strontium that rubidium-strontium analysis is impractical. Still,\r\nwe can use the rapid survey methods as for feldspar, selecting the few\r\nrocks that would be useful. This work has been done frequently, and the\r\nresults have been fruitful for rubidium-strontium analysis. The\r\nwhole-rock rubidium-strontium age dates the time when the rock became\r\nimpermeable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SOME INTERESTING RESULTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Man from Olduvai\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fossil skull of Zinjanthropus, nearly 2,000,000 years\r\nold, discovered in 1959 by Dr. L. S. B. Leakey in Olduvai Gorge.\r\nAccurate dating of this earliest human ancestor was possible by using\r\nthe potassium-argon method._]\r\n\r\nOne of the most talked-about age measurements in recent years was the\r\ndetermination of the unexpectedly great age of fossil ancestors of man,\r\nfound by the British anthropologist, Dr. L. S. B. Leakey, in Olduvai\r\nGorge in Tanzania. The measurements were made by Garniss H. Curtis and\r\nJack F. Evernden at the University of California in Berkeley by the\r\npotassium-argon method. The age came out a little less than 2 million\r\nyears, about twice as old as it “should be” in the view of many\r\nscientists. Human remains of such great antiquity had never been found\r\nbefore, and much doubt was raised about the validity of the figures.\r\n\r\nTime periods as short as two million years are not easy to measure by\r\npotassium-argon. The amount of argon produced in that time is extremely\r\nsmall, and contamination by argon from the air is a serious problem.\r\nStill, the measurements were repeated, the rocks were studied again, and\r\nthe result did not change: The fossils were still about 2 million years\r\nold.\r\n\r\nIn cases like this, one tries to find some other method to check the\r\nresults in an independent way. After many attempts it was discovered\r\nthat the same rock strata dated by potassium-argon also contained some\r\npumice—a porous volcanic glass—and that this glass was suitable for\r\nuranium fission-track dating. The measurements were made in the General\r\nElectric Research Laboratory. What was the result? Just about 2 million\r\nyears!\r\n\r\nWhen such altogether different techniques give the same number, one can\r\nhave some confidence that the number is exact. It would be difficult to\r\nimagine a disturbance in nature that would cause these unrelated methods\r\nto give the same wrong number—in both cases by a factor of two. The\r\ndouble check simply means the Olduvai man is 2 million years old. There\r\nis not much doubt about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Geologic Time Scale\r\n\r\nMuch of historical geology is based on a relationship called the LAW OF\r\nSUPERPOSITION. This simply means that when some rock formation was\r\nplaced on top of some other formation by natural processes\r\n(sedimentation or volcanic eruption, for example), the layer on top must\r\nbe younger than the one on the bottom. Such a conclusion may now seem\r\nobvious, but the concept was not even expressed until the very end of\r\nthe eighteenth century and was still a matter of scientific controversy\r\nwhen Abraham Lincoln was a boy. It was the law of superposition,\r\nhowever, that led the early geologists to establish the first geologic\r\ntime scales and to realize the enormous extent of geologic time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Diagram illustrating the law of superposition. Each rock\r\nbed is younger than the strata under it._]\r\n\r\nIn essence the system of establishing age by this concept is this:\r\nSomewhere a large and easily recognized layer of sedimentary rock was\r\nknown. It had a characteristic color, texture, gross composition, and\r\noverall appearance. Let us call it _bed M_. This bed could be traced\r\nacross the countryside until a place was reached where it could be seen\r\nthat _bed M_ rested on another, different layer of rock, which we might\r\ncall _bed L_. _Bed L_ could also be traced some distance and ultimately\r\ncould be observed resting on a still different stratum, which we shall\r\ncall _bed K_. Some of these beds had fossils in them, and it was\r\neventually realized that rocks with the same kinds of fossils are of the\r\nsame age, even though they may differ in other respects—in color or\r\ncomposition, for instance.\r\n\r\nIf _bed M_ was followed in another direction, perhaps a point was\r\nreached where it dipped down a little, and here, was found still another\r\nlayer—call it _bed N_—on top of _M_. Obviously, the sequence of beds\r\nfrom oldest to youngest was _K-L-M-N_. Their relative ages were now\r\nestablished. Over the years, hundreds of geologists described various\r\nrock layers and identified the fossils in them. By the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century, this “layer-cake” structure of sedimentary rocks was\r\nwell-known in western Europe. (One may say, parenthetically, that\r\nAmerica was geologically a vast unknown at that time. Today we know much\r\nmore about the geology of Antarctica than anyone a hundred years ago\r\nknew about the geology of the United States.)\r\n\r\nA system of nomenclature for the “layer-cake” was developed and refined.\r\nGradually this nomenclature was accepted internationally. Long-range\r\ncorrelations between beds of the same age, distant halfway around the\r\nglobe from each other, were made possible as the science of PALEONTOLOGY\r\ndeveloped. The relative age of almost any rock containing even poorly\r\npreserved fossils could be determined anywhere in the world with\r\nprecision. That is, the age of rock layers in relation to one another\r\nwas known. But the real age—the absolute age—remained unknown until\r\nknowledge of radioactivity provided the necessary clocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A geologist carefully maps the layers of soil in which\r\nancient flint tools have been found. Exact correlation of the\r\ntool-bearing strata with material datable by carbon-14 analysis must be\r\naccomplished before the age of the tools can be determined._]\r\n\r\nEven this process wasn’t entirely without problems. The difficulty lay\r\nin the fact that ordinary sedimentary rocks (shale, sandstone, and\r\nlimestone) cannot be dated by the usual nuclear methods because they\r\npresent no suitable closed systems. Only some volcanic sediments can be\r\nreliably dated by the mica, feldspar, and zircon they contain; but these\r\nancient ashfalls are rare, usually are only a few inches thick, and are\r\nnot easy to identify at the surface because they weather quickly to\r\nclay. Only about a dozen volcanic beds have been accurately dated in\r\nNorth America. The time points they established are mainstays of the\r\npresent geologic time scale, but they have had to be supplemented by\r\nindirect information.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Steeply dipping sandstone strata from the Cretaceous\r\nPeriod near Gallup, New Mexico. This photo, taken in 1901 (note the\r\nhorse-drawn wagon), was made on an early government survey of Western\r\nlands._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fossils of bird tracks in sandstone in Death Valley,\r\nCalifornia._]\r\n\r\nThe most important of these indirect time points are furnished by what\r\ngeologists call BRACKETED INTRUSIVES. It often happens in geologic\r\nhistory that a mass of rock becomes molten at a great depth and forces\r\nits way up through several layers of sedimentary rocks. The sedimentary\r\nlayers are usually bent and twisted (folded) by the upthrust, and where\r\nthe cooler rock comes in contact with the molten mass, cooler material\r\nis burned (recrystallized). Geologists call that process CONTACT\r\nMETAMORPHISM because the sedimentary rock forms are changed, or\r\nmetamorphosed, to have another form or composition.\r\nContact-metamorphosed rocks, in spite of the damage they have suffered,\r\nmay contain recognizable and accurately datable fossils. Thereby the\r\nmetamorphic rock establishes a lower limit for the age of the intrusion:\r\nIt must be younger than the fossils in the youngest of the metamorphic\r\nrocks it touched.\r\n\r\nNow on top of the intrusive rock, we may find another sedimentary rock,\r\ndeposited on top of the intrusive after it cooled and was exposed by the\r\nerosion of overlying materials, perhaps millions of years later. This\r\nnew sediment may also contain fossils and thus furnish an upper limit\r\nfor the age of the intrusion. The measured age of the intrusive rock\r\nthus can be used to set upper and lower limits on the absolute ages of\r\nthe two sediments. If we are lucky, the two sediments will bracket a\r\nrelatively short interval, making our measurement quite precise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Idealized sketch of a bracketed intrusive. The igneous\r\n(molten) rock must be younger than the sedimentary rock (A) it intrudes,\r\nand older than the rock (B) that overlies it. The relative age of the\r\nsedimentary beds is known from their fossils._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Facsimile reprint of the famous time scale proposed by\r\nArthur Holmes in 1959._]\r\n\r\n                       Time-scale in millions of years\r\n  PERIODS            Since beginning of period    Duration of period\r\n  PLEISTOCENE                                     _ca_ 1\r\n  ....               _ca_ 1                       ....\r\n  PLIOCENE                                        10\r\n  ....               11                           ....\r\n  MIOCENE                                         14\r\n  ....               25                           ....\r\n  OLIGOCENE                                       15\r\n  ....               40                           ....\r\n  EOCENE                                          20\r\n  ....               60                           ....\r\n  PALEOCENE                                       10\r\n  ....               70 ± 2                       ....\r\n     Upper }\r\n  CRETACEOUS                                      65\r\n     Lower }\r\n  ....               135 ± 5                      ....\r\n     Upper }\r\n  JURASSIC                                        45\r\n     Mid. & Lower }\r\n  ....               180± 5                       ....\r\n  TRIASSIC                                        45\r\n  ....               225 ± 5                      ....\r\n  PERMIAN                                         45\r\n  ....               270 ± 5                      ....\r\n     Upper }\r\n  CARBONIFEROUS                                   80\r\n     Lower }\r\n  ....               350 ± 10                     ....\r\n     Upper }\r\n  DEVONIAN                                        50\r\n     Lower }\r\n  ....               400 ± 10                     ....\r\n  SILURIAN                                        40\r\n  ....               440 ± 10                     ....\r\n  ORDOVICIAN                                      60\r\n  ....               500 ± 15                     ....\r\n  CAMBRIAN                                        100\r\n  ....               600 ± 20                     ....\r\n\r\nUsing measurements made in many laboratories, and interpolating between\r\nthem by using the relative thicknesses of sediments, the great British\r\ngeologist, Arthur Holmes, established the time scale that is in general\r\nuse today. His original scale is shown on the preceding page. Small\r\nchanges can be expected to be made in this scale from time to time, but\r\nmajor alterations are not likely, except perhaps in the Cambrian Epoch\r\nwhere the present data are unreliable because they are not complete. (A\r\nscale showing the epochs or periods as often given now is on page 4.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPrecambrian Stratigraphy\r\n\r\nSo far we have talked only about rocks that are of the Cambrian Epoch or\r\nyounger—rocks that may contain fossils. Yet there are vast areas (most\r\nof Canada, for example) that are covered with rocks older than the\r\nCambrian formation. Some Precambrian fossils have been found, but they\r\nare so rare that they are useless for dating the strata containing them.\r\nLong-range correlation of Precambrian rocks must rely on nuclear\r\nmeasurements. Therefore it has been only in the last dozen or so years\r\nthat some order could be established for the Precambrian rock sequences.\r\nThe elaborate Precambrian stratigraphies (arrangements of strata in\r\nsequence) proposed in the past, most of them based on superficial\r\nsimilarities of the rocks in one place to those in another place, now\r\nhave been drastically altered and in some cases completely overturned by\r\nnuclear measurements. We are still far from understanding the sequence\r\nof all the events in that vast span of time we call the Precambrian.\r\nMany thousands of nuclear age determinations will have to be made to\r\nlighten the dark corners of our ignorance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Folded strata of Precambrian rocks, including limestones\r\nand shales, in Glacier National Park, Montana._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     AND WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps we must first realize that we really haven’t come very far yet.\r\nGranted that the age of rocks in many parts of the world is now suddenly\r\nknown—and that this was a total mystery some dozen years ago. Granted\r\nthat enormous strides forward have been made. It’s only a beginning.\r\n\r\nVast areas of the world are still geologically unexplored. The geologic\r\ntime scale is still fragmentary and crude. Thousands of important\r\ngeologic questions remain to be defined, explored, and answered by\r\nnuclear age determination. And—as is inevitable in science—many of them\r\nwill lead to new questions. It is apparent that dating techniques have\r\nbarely begun to be used and understood by geologists.\r\n\r\nBut apart from geologic work, what else is in store? It is difficult to\r\npredict, but probably the most important advance in the next decade or\r\ntwo will come when we obtain samples of rock from the moon. Will there\r\nbe young rocks there or will they all be 4550 million years old? Or will\r\nthey perhaps be some other age? The chemical composition and nuclear\r\nages of the first moon samples will probably be the most important\r\ninformation we can hope to obtain from them. These results from the moon\r\nwill contribute enormously to our understanding of the processes that\r\nformed the earth, made the continents, and determined the major features\r\nof our world.\r\n\r\nWe have a long way to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GLOSSARY\r\n\r\n\r\nAEON   One billion (10⁹) years.\r\n\r\nALPHA DECAY   Radioactive decay with emission of an alpha particle.\r\n\r\nALPHA PARTICLE   Essentially the nucleus of helium, composed of two\r\n  neutrons and two protons with double positive charge.\r\n\r\nANTICOINCIDENCE RING   A ring of counters connected to exclude outside\r\n  radiation.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND COUNT   The number of impulses per unit time registered on a\r\n  counting instrument when no sample is present.\r\n\r\nBETA DECAY   Radioactive decay with emission of a beta particle.\r\n\r\nBETA PARTICLE   An electron emitted by a nucleus.\r\n\r\nBRACKETED INTRUSIVE   Igneous rock extending into sedimentary rocks that\r\n  are datable by their fossils.\r\n\r\nCLOSED SYSTEM   A system in which the parent material radioactively\r\n  decays into its daughter products and nothing is added or removed.\r\n\r\nCOMMON   (strontium, lead, etc.) The ordinary element present in nature\r\n  at any one time as distinguished from that produced by radioactive\r\n  decay.\r\n\r\nCONCORDIA ANALYSIS   A mathematical technique to determine graphically\r\n  the age of a material containing radiogenic lead by comparing its\r\n  uranium-to-lead ratio with the similar ratio in a closed uranium-lead\r\n  system.\r\n\r\nCONTACT METAMORPHISM   A metamorphism genetically related to the\r\n  intrusion of molten masses of rock and taking place at or near the\r\n  contact.\r\n\r\nCOSMIC RAYS   High-energy particles moving in our galaxy.\r\n\r\nCRYSTAL   A periodic or regularly repeating arrangement of atoms, formed\r\n  from a single element or compound.\r\n\r\nDAUGHTER   A nuclide formed from the radioactive decay of another\r\n  nuclide.\r\n\r\nDECAY CONSTANT   The number of atoms decaying per atom per unit of time\r\n  (0.693/half-life).\r\n\r\nELECTRON CAPTURE   A nuclear process in which the nucleus of an atom\r\n  captures an electron from one of the inner shells.\r\n\r\nELECTRONS  Elementary particles with a unit negative electrical charge\r\n  and a mass 1/1837 that of the proton, or 9.12 × 10⁻²⁷ gram.

This\r\n  process continues through a series of distinct steps until a stable\r\n  atom—one that is not radioactive—is formed. All natural radioactivity\r\n  in the heavy elements proceeds by such a series of steps, and the\r\n  series finally ends with a stable form of lead as its end product. In\r\n  other words, any naturally radioactive heavy element eventually\r\n  becomes nonradioactive lead.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of every atom (except hydrogen) contains one or more\r\n  neutrons and one or more protons. The instability of the nuclei of the\r\n  heavy atoms is related to the ratio of the number of neutrons to the\r\n  number of protons in the nuclei. Radioactive decay is, in fact, a way\r\n  of adjusting these ratios. The adjustment can occur in various ways.\r\n  The most common is the emission of alpha particles or beta particles.\r\n\r\nAn alpha particle is identical with the nucleus of a helium atom and has\r\n  two neutrons and two protons bundled together. Loss of an alpha\r\n  particle from a nucleus lowers the mass number (the total of protons\r\n  and neutrons) of the parent nucleus by four and the atomic number (the\r\n  number of protons) by two; the number of neutrons also is reduced by\r\n  two.\r\n\r\nA beta particle is an electron and has a negative electric charge. When\r\n  a beta particle is emitted from a nucleus, the nucleus is changed so\r\n  that it has one more proton (which has a positive charge) and one less\r\n  neutron (which has no charge); in effect, a neutron has changed into a\r\n  proton as the nucleus lost a negative charge. Beta decay occurs in\r\n  nuclei with a greater proportion of neutrons than is normal for the\r\n  number of protons. Since beta emission increases the proportion of\r\n  protons, the process raises the atomic number of the parent nucleus by\r\n  one and leaves the mass number the same.\r\n\r\nGamma rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation. They are emitted\r\n  when a nucleus shifts from one energy state to a lower energy\r\n  state—the energy difference emerging as the gamma radiation. Gamma\r\n  emission often accompanies alpha or beta emission, but the production\r\n  of gamma rays does not itself alter the atomic number nor the mass\r\n  number of the parent.\r\n\r\nNuclei also can decay by emission of a positron, which is a positively\r\n  charged electron. When this occurs, the new nucleus has one more\r\n  neutron and one less proton than its parent; in effect a proton has\r\n  become a neutron as the nucleus loses a positive charge. Positrons\r\n  usually are emitted by nuclei that have a greater proportion of\r\n  protons than is normal for the number of neutrons.\r\n\r\nAnother process—internal electron conversion—sometimes occurs in\r\n  connection with gamma-ray emission, usually in heavy elements when the\r\n  gamma-ray energy is low. Instead of being emitted directly, the gamma\r\n  ray strikes an orbital electron, knocking the electron out of the\r\n  atom; the gamma ray then disappears. Another electron jumps into the\r\n  “hole” in the orbit from which the first electron was emitted, and\r\n  this jump—from a higher to a lower energy level—results in the\r\n  emission of an X ray (which is similar to a gamma ray, but originates\r\n  in the electron orbit region of the atom, not in the nucleus).\r\n\r\nFinally, a nucleus may be altered by electron capture. In a nucleus with\r\n  a low ratio of neutrons to protons, the nucleus captures one of its\r\n  own orbital electrons. This immediately combines with a proton to form\r\n  a new neutron and emit a neutrino (a high-energy particle with neither\r\n  mass nor charge). The process increases the neutron-to-proton ratio of\r\n  the nucleus; the daughter has the same mass number as the parent, but\r\n  has an atomic number one less than the parent.\r\n\r\nThere are three series by which naturally radioactive nuclei decay to\r\n  stable ones: The Uranium Series, the Thorium Series, and the Actinium\r\n  Series. Man-made radioactive nuclei decay similarly, with bismuth as\r\n  the end product, via the Neptunium Series. These can be illustrated in\r\n  tabular form and diagrammatically. The Actinium Series (Uranium-235\r\n  Series), for example, proceeds like this:\r\n\r\n                           THE URANIUM-235 SERIES\r\n  Element            Symbol    Radiation Emitted         Half-life\r\n  Uranium            ²³⁵U      α                         7.13 × 10⁸ years\r\n  Thorium            ²³¹Th     β                         25.6 hours\r\n  Protactinium       ²³¹Pa     α                         3.25 × 10⁴ years\r\n  Actinium[16]       ²²⁷Ac     β (98.8%) and α (1.2%)    21.2 years\r\n     Thorium         ²²⁷Th     α                         18.17 days\r\n     Francium        ²²³Fr     β                         22 minutes\r\n  Radium             ²²³Ra     α                         11.7 days\r\n  Radon              ²¹⁹Rn     α                         4.0 seconds\r\n  Polonium[16]       ²¹⁵Po     α (~100%) and β (~5 ×     1.83 × 10⁻³ second\r\n                               10⁻⁴%)\r\n     Lead            ²¹¹Pb     β                         36.1 minutes\r\n     Astatine        ²¹⁵At     α                         ~10⁻⁴ second\r\n  Bismuth[16]        ²¹¹Bi     α (99.7%) and β (0.3%)    2.15 minutes\r\n     Polonium        ²¹¹Po     α                         0.25 second\r\n     Thallium        ²⁰⁷Tl     β                         4.78 minutes\r\n  Lead               ²⁰⁷Pb     —                         Stable\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Uranium-235 Series]\r\n\r\nThe Uranium (Uranium-238) Series proceeds like this:\r\n\r\n                           THE URANIUM-238 SERIES\r\n  Element            Symbol    Radiation                 Half-life\r\n  Uranium            ²³⁸U      α                         4.51 × 10⁹ years\r\n  Thorium            ²³⁴Th     β                         24.1 days\r\n  Protactinium[17]   ²³⁴Pa     β                         1.18 minutes\r\n  Uranium            ²³⁴U      α                         2.48 × 10⁵ years\r\n  Thorium            ²³⁰Th     α                         7.6 × 10⁴ years\r\n  Radium             ²²⁶Ra     α                         1.62 × 10³ years\r\n  Radon              ²²²Rn     α                         3.82 days\r\n  Polonium[18]       ²¹⁸Po     α (99.98%) and β          3.05 minutes\r\n                               (0.02%)\r\n     Lead            ²¹⁴Pb     β                         26.8 minutes\r\n     Astatine        ²¹⁸At     α                         1.3 seconds\r\n  Bismuth[18]        ²¹⁴Bi     β (99.96%) and α          19.7 minutes\r\n                               (0.04%)\r\n     Polonium        ²¹⁴Po     α                         1.6 × 10⁻⁴ second\r\n     Thallium        ²¹⁰Tl     β                         1.32 minutes\r\n  Lead               ²¹⁰Pb     β                         22 years\r\n  Bismuth[18]        ²¹⁰Bi     β (~100%) and α (~2 ×     5.0 days\r\n                               10⁻⁴%)\r\n     Polonium        ²¹⁰Po     α                         138.4 days\r\n     Thallium        ²⁰⁶Tl     β                         4.30 minutes\r\n     Lead            ²⁰⁶Pb     ...

S. War Department program during World War II that developed\r\n    the first nuclear weapons.\r\n\r\n[4]Drawn to scale, the whole age of man is represented by less than the\r\n    width of the line.\r\n\r\n[5]For more information on the structure of atoms, see _Our Atomic\r\n    World_, a companion booklet in this series.\r\n\r\n[6]From the _Chart of the Nuclides_, prepared by David T. Goldman,\r\n    Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, August 1964.\r\n\r\n[7]This decay process proceeds in a series of steps, during which 6\r\n    alpha particles and 4 beta particles are emitted. (See Appendix.)\r\n\r\n[8]Named after their creator, John Napier, a Scottish mathematician\r\n    (1550-1617), who also invented the decimal point.\r\n\r\n[9]It is difficult to determine the half-life of ¹⁴C exactly. In the\r\n    early days of ¹⁴C dating, in order not to delay continued work, an\r\n    arbitrary value of 5568 years was chosen and this value is still\r\n    used in calculations.\r\n\r\n[10]This means that uranium decays through successive steps in which the\r\n    entire series emits eight alpha particles. (See Appendix.)\r\n\r\n[11]Remember, this enormous period of time is a measure of the _rate_ of\r\n    spontaneous fission, _not_ of the age of ²³⁸U.\r\n\r\n[12]The rhenium-osmium scheme is shown below the dotted line because the\r\n    method is still in an early experimental stage and its general\r\n    utility is not yet established.\r\n\r\n[13]For more on this family of elements, see _Rare Earths, The Fraternal\r\n    Fifteen_, a companion booklet in this series.\r\n\r\n[14]For a fuller explanation of the fission process, see _Our Atomic\r\n    World_, another booklet in this series.\r\n\r\n[15]Neutrons that have had their speed reduced by passing through a\r\n    moderator (graphite, for example) which is built into every reactor\r\n    to accomplish this very thing. For more about how this is done, see\r\n    _Nuclear Reactors_ and _Research Reactors_, companion booklets in\r\n    this series.\r\n\r\n[16]Note that some radionuclides sometimes decay by one method,\r\n    sometimes by another. For example, 98.8% of the nuclei of\r\n    actinium-227 emit a beta particle to form thorium-227; the remaining\r\n    1.2% emit an alpha particle to form francium-223; both of these\r\n    daughter products decay to radium-223.\r\n\r\n[17]Some of the protactinium (0.12%) changes by an intermediate step,\r\n    known as isomeric transition, in which its nucleus shifts to a lower\r\n    energy state. The process does not alter the remaining\r\n    parent-daughter progression in the series.\r\n\r\n[18]Undergoes both alpha and beta decay, in definite proportion of decay\r\n    events, as shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis booklet is one of the “Understanding the Atom” Series.
