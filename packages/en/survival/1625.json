The place is an English\r\nsea-port. The time is night. And the business of the moment is--dancing.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor and Corporation of the town are giving a grand ball, in\r\ncelebration of the departure of an Arctic expedition from their port.\r\nThe ships of the expedition are two in number--the _Wanderer_ and the\r\n_Sea-mew_. They are to sail (in search of the Northwest Passage) on the\r\nnext day, with the morning tide.\r\n\r\nHonor to the Mayor and Corporation! It is a brilliant ball. The band is\r\ncomplete. The room is spacious. The large conservatory opening out of it\r\nis pleasantly lighted with Chinese lanterns, and beautifully decorated\r\nwith shrubs and flowers. All officers of the army and navy who are\r\npresent wear their uniforms in honor of the occasion. Among the ladies,\r\nthe display of dresses (a subject which the men don’t understand) is\r\nbewildering--and the average of beauty (a subject which the men do\r\nunderstand) is the highest average attainable, in all parts of the room.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, the dance which is in progress is a quadrille. General\r\nadmiration selects two of the ladies who are dancing as its favorite\r\nobjects. One is a dark beauty in the prime of womanhood--the wife of\r\nFirst Lieutenant Crayford, of the _Wanderer_. The other is a young girl,\r\npale and delicate; dressed simply in white; with no ornament on her head\r\nbut her own lovely brown hair. This is Miss Clara Burnham--an orphan.\r\nShe is Mrs. Crayford’s dearest friend, and she is to stay with Mrs.\r\nCrayford during the lieutenant’s absence in the Arctic regions. She\r\nis now dancing, with the lieutenant himself for partner, and with Mrs.\r\nCrayford and Captain Helding (commanding officer of the _Wanderer_) for\r\nvis-a-vis--in plain English, for opposite couple.\r\n\r\nThe conversation between Captain Helding and Mrs. Crayford, in one\r\nof the intervals of the dance, turns on Miss Burnham. The captain is\r\ngreatly interested in Clara. He admires her beauty; but he thinks her\r\nmanner--for a young girl--strangely serious and subdued. Is she in\r\ndelicate health?\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford shakes her head; sighs mysteriously; and answers,\r\n\r\n“In _very_ delicate health, Captain Helding.”\r\n\r\n“Consumptive?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the least.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad to hear that. She is a charming creature, Mrs. Crayford. She\r\ninterests me indescribably. If I was only twenty years younger--perhaps\r\n(as I am not twenty years younger) I had better not finish the sentence?\r\nIs it indiscreet, my dear lady, to inquire what _is_ the matter with\r\nher?”\r\n\r\n“It might be indiscreet, on the part of a stranger,” said Mrs. Crayford.\r\n“An old friend like you may make any inquiries. I wish I could tell\r\nyou what is the matter with Clara. It is a mystery to the doctors\r\nthemselves. Some of the mischief is due, in my humble opinion, to the\r\nmanner in which she has been brought up.”\r\n\r\n“Ay! ay! A bad school, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Very bad, Captain Helding. But not the sort of school which you have in\r\nyour mind at this moment. Clara’s early years were spent in a lonely old\r\nhouse in the Highlands of Scotland. The ignorant people about her were\r\nthe people who did the mischief which I have just been speaking of.\r\nThey filled her mind with the superstitions which are still respected as\r\ntruths in the wild North--especially the superstition called the Second\r\nSight.”\r\n\r\n“God bless me!” cried the captain, “you don’t mean to say she believes\r\nin such stuff as that? In these enlightened times too!”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford looked at her partner with a satirical smile.\r\n\r\n“In these enlightened times, Captain Helding, we only believe in dancing\r\ntables, and in messages sent from the other world by spirits who can’t\r\nspell! By comparison with such superstitions as these, even the Second\r\nSight has something--in the shape of poetry--to recommend it, surely?\r\nEstimate for yourself,” she continued seriously, “the effect of\r\nsuch surroundings as I have described on a delicate, sensitive young\r\ncreature--a girl with a naturally imaginative temperament leading a\r\nlonely, neglected life. Is it so very surprising that she should\r\ncatch the infection of the superstition about her? And is it quite\r\nincomprehensible that her nervous system should suffer accordingly, at a\r\nvery critical period of her life?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all, Mrs. Crayford--not at all, ma’am, as you put it. Still it\r\nis a little startling, to a commonplace man like me, to meet a young\r\nlady at a ball who believes in the Second Sight. Does she really profess\r\nto see into the future? Am I to understand that she positively falls\r\ninto a trance, and sees people in distant countries, and foretells\r\nevents to come? That is the Second Sight, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“That is the Second Sight, captain. And that is, really and positively,\r\nwhat she does.”\r\n\r\n“The young lady who is dancing opposite to us?”\r\n\r\n“The young lady who is dancing opposite to us.”\r\n\r\nThe captain waited a little--letting the new flood of information which\r\nhad poured in on him settle itself steadily in his mind. This process\r\naccomplished, the Arctic explorer proceeded resolutely on his way to\r\nfurther discoveries.\r\n\r\n“May I ask, ma’am, if you have ever seen her in a state of trance with\r\nyour own eyes?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“My sister and I both saw her in the trance, little more than a month\r\nsince,” Mrs. Crayford replied. “She had been nervous and irritable all\r\nthe morning; and we took her out into the garden to breathe the fresh\r\nair. Suddenly, without any reason for it, the color left her face. She\r\nstood between us, insensible to touch, insensible to sound; motionless\r\nas stone, and cold as death in a moment. The first change we noticed\r\ncame after a lapse of some minutes. Her hands began to move slowly, as\r\nif she was groping in the dark. Words dropped one by one from her lips,\r\nin a lost, vacant tone, as if she was talking in her sleep. Whether\r\nwhat she said referred to past or future I cannot tell you. She spoke of\r\npersons in a foreign country--perfect strangers to my sister and to me.\r\nAfter a little interval, she suddenly became silent. A momentary color\r\nappeared in her face, and left it again. Her eyes closed--her feet\r\nfailed her--and she sank insensible into our arms.”\r\n\r\n“Sank insensible into your arms,” repeated the captain, absorbing his\r\nnew information. “Most extraordinary! And--in this state of health--she\r\ngoes out to parties, and dances. More extraordinary still!”\r\n\r\n“You are entirely mistaken,” said Mrs. Crayford. “She is only here\r\nto-night to please me; and she is only dancing to please my husband.\r\nAs a rule, she shuns all society. The doctor recommends change and\r\namusement for her. She won’t listen to him. Except on rare occasions\r\nlike this, she persists in remaining at home.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Helding brightened at the allusion to the doctor. Something\r\npractical might be got out of the doctor. Scientific man. Sure to see\r\nthis very obscure subject under a new light. “How does it strike the\r\ndoctor now?” said the captain. “Viewed simply as a Case, ma’am, how does\r\nit strike the doctor?”\r\n\r\n“He will give no positive opinion,” Mrs. Crayford answered. “He told\r\nme that such cases as Clara’s were by no means unfamiliar to medical\r\npractice. ‘We know,’ he told me, ‘that certain disordered conditions of\r\nthe brain and the nervous system produce results quite as extraordinary\r\nas any that you have described--and there our knowledge ends. Neither my\r\nscience nor any man’s science can clear up the mystery in this case.\r\nIt is an especially difficult case to deal with, because Miss Burnham’s\r\nearly associations dispose her to attach a superstitious importance to\r\nthe malady--the hysterical malady as some doctors would call it--from\r\nwhich she suffers. I can give you instructions for preserving her\r\ngeneral health; and I can recommend you to try some change in her\r\nlife--provided you first relieve her mind of any secret anxieties that\r\nmay possibly be preying on it.’”\r\n\r\nThe captain smiled self-approvingly. The doctor had justified his\r\nanticipations. The doctor had suggested a practical solution of the\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n“Ay! ay! At last we have hit the nail on the head! Secret anxieties.\r\nYes! yes! Plain enough now. A disappointment in love--eh, Mrs.\r\nCrayford?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, Captain Helding; I am quite in the dark. Clara’s\r\nconfidence in me--in other matters unbounded--is, in this matter of her\r\n(supposed) anxieties, a confidence still withheld. In all else we are\r\nlike sisters. I sometimes fear there may indeed be some trouble\r\npreying secretly on her mind. I sometimes feel a little hurt at her\r\nincomprehensible silence.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Helding was ready with his own practical remedy for this\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n“Encouragement is all she wants, ma’am. Take my word for it, this\r\nmatter rests entirely with you. It’s all in a nutshell. Encourage her to\r\nconfide in you--and she _will_ confide.”\r\n\r\n“I am waiting to encourage her, captain, until she is left alone with\r\nme--after you have all sailed for the Arctic seas. In the meantime, will\r\nyou consider what I have said to you as intended for your ear only? And\r\nwill you forgive me, if I own that the turn the subject has taken does\r\nnot tempt me to pursue it any further?”\r\n\r\nThe captain took the hint. He instantly changed the subject; choosing,\r\non this occasion, safe professional topics. He spoke of ships that were\r\nordered on foreign service; and, finding that these as subjects failed\r\nto interest Mrs. Crayford, he spoke next of ships that were ordered home\r\nagain. This last experiment produced its effect--an effect which the\r\ncaptain had not bargained for.\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” he began, “that the _Atalanta_ is expected back from the\r\nWest Coast of Africa every day? Have you any acquaintances among the\r\nofficers of that ship?”\r\n\r\nAs it so happened, he put those questions to Mrs. Crayford while they\r\nwere engaged in one of the figures of the dance which brought them\r\nwithin hearing of the opposite couple. At the same moment--to the\r\nastonishment of her friends and admirers--Miss Clara Burnham threw the\r\nquadrille into confusion by making a mistake! Everybody waited to see\r\nher set the mistake right. She made no attempt to set it right--she\r\nturned deadly pale and caught her partner by the arm.\r\n\r\n“The heat!” she said, faintly. “Take me away--take me into the air!”\r\n\r\nLieutenant Crayford instantly led her out of the dance, and took her\r\ninto the cool and empty conservatory, at the end of the room. As a\r\nmatter of course, Captain Helding and Mrs. Crayford left the quadrille\r\nat the same time. The captain saw his way to a joke.\r\n\r\n“Is this the trance coming on?” he whispered. “If it is, as commander\r\nof the Arctic expedition, I have a particular request to make. Will\r\nthe Second Sight oblige me by seeing the shortest way to the Northwest\r\nPassage, before we leave England?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford declined to humor the joke. “If you will excuse my leaving\r\nyou,” she said quietly, “I will try and find out what is the matter with\r\nMiss Burnham.”\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the conservatory, Mrs. Crayford encountered her\r\nhusband. The lieutenant was of middle age, tall and comely. A man with\r\na winning simplicity and gentleness in his manner, and an irresistible\r\nkindness in his brave blue eyes. In one word, a man whom everybody\r\nloved--including his wife.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be alarmed,” said the lieutenant. “The heat has overcome\r\nher--that’s all.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford shook her head, and looked at her husband, half\r\nsatirically, half fondly.\r\n\r\n“You dear old innocent!” she exclaimed, “that excuse may do for _you_.\r\nFor my part, I don’t believe a word of it. Go and get another partner,\r\nand leave Clara to me.”\r\n\r\nShe entered the conservatory and seated herself by Clara’s side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Now, my dear!” Mrs. Crayford began, “what does this mean?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“That won’t do, Clara. Try again.”\r\n\r\n“The heat of the room--”\r\n\r\n“That won’t do, either. Say that you choose to keep your own secrets,\r\nand I shall understand what you mean.”\r\n\r\nClara’s sad, clear gray eyes looked up for the first time in Mrs.\r\nCrayford’s face, and suddenly became dimmed with tears.\r\n\r\n“If I only dared tell you!” she murmured. “I hold so to your good\r\nopinion of me, Lucy--and I am so afraid of losing it.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford’s manner changed. Her eyes rested gravely and anxiously on\r\nClara’s face.\r\n\r\n“You know as well as I do that nothing can shake my affection for you,”\r\n she said. “Do justice, my child, to your old friend. There is nobody\r\nhere to listen to what we say. Open your heart, Clara. I see you are in\r\ntrouble, and I want to comfort you.”\r\n\r\nClara began to yield. In other words, she began to make conditions.\r\n\r\n“Will you promise to keep what I tell you a secret from every living\r\ncreature?” she began.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford met that question, by putting a question on her side.\r\n\r\n“Does ‘every living creature’ include my husband?”\r\n\r\n“Your husband more than anybody! I love him, I revere him. He is so\r\nnoble; he is so good! If I told him what I am going to tell you, he\r\nwould despise me. Own it plainly, Lucy, if I am asking too much in\r\nasking you to keep a secret from your husband.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, child! When you are married, you will know that the easiest\r\nof all secrets to keep is a secret from your husband. I give you my\r\npromise. Now begin!”\r\n\r\nClara hesitated painfully.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how to begin!” she exclaimed, with a burst of despair.\r\n“The words won’t come to me.”\r\n\r\n“Then I must help you. Do you feel ill tonight? Do you feel as you felt\r\nthat day when you were with my sister and me in the garden?”\r\n\r\n“Oh no.”\r\n\r\n“You are not ill, you are not really affected by the heat--and yet you\r\nturn as pale as ashes, and you are obliged to leave the quadrille! There\r\nmust be some reason for this.”\r\n\r\n“There is a reason. Captain Helding--”\r\n\r\n“Captain Helding! What in the name of wonder has the captain to do with\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“He told you something about the _Atalanta_. He said the _Atalanta_ was\r\nexpected back from Africa immediately.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and what of that? Is there anybody in whom you are interested\r\ncoming home in the ship?”\r\n\r\n“Somebody whom I am afraid of is coming home in the ship.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford’s magnificent black eyes opened wide in amazement.\r\n\r\n“My dear Clara! do you really mean what you say?”\r\n\r\n“Wait a little, Lucy, and you shall judge for yourself. We must go\r\nback--if I am to make you understand me--to the year before we knew each\r\nother--to the last year of my father’s life. Did I ever tell you that my\r\nfather moved southward, for the sake of his health, to a house in Kent\r\nthat was lent to him by a friend?”\r\n\r\n“No, my dear; I don’t remember ever hearing of the house in Kent. Tell\r\nme about it.”\r\n\r\n“There is nothing to tell, except this: the new house was near a fine\r\ncountry-seat standing in its own park. The owner of the place was\r\na gentleman named Wardour. He, too, was one of my father’s Kentish\r\nfriends. He had an only son.”\r\n\r\nShe paused, and played nervously with her fan. Mrs. Crayford looked at\r\nher attentively. Clara’s eyes remained fixed on her fan--Clara said no\r\nmore. “What was the son’s name?” asked Mrs. Crayford, quietly.\r\n\r\n“Richard.”\r\n\r\n“Am I right, Clara, in suspecting that Mr. Richard Wardour admired you?”\r\n\r\nThe question produced its intended effect. The question helped Clara to\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\n“I hardly knew at first,” she said, “whether he admired me or not.\r\nHe was very strange in his ways--headstrong, terribly headstrong and\r\npassionate; but generous and affectionate in spite of his faults of\r\ntemper. Can you understand such a character?”\r\n\r\n“Such characters exist by thousands. I have my faults of temper. I begin\r\nto like Richard already. Go on.”\r\n\r\n“The days went by, Lucy, and the weeks went by. We were thrown very\r\nmuch together. I began, little by little, to have some suspicion of the\r\ntruth.”\r\n\r\n“And Richard helped to confirm your suspicions, of course?”\r\n\r\n“No. He was not--unhappily for me--he was not that sort of man. He never\r\nspoke of the feeling with which he regarded me. It was I who saw it. I\r\ncouldn’t help seeing it. I did all I could to show that I was willing to\r\nbe a sister to him, and that I could never be anything else. He did not\r\nunderstand me, or he would not, I can’t say which.”\r\n\r\n“‘Would not,’ is the most likely, my dear. Go on.”\r\n\r\n“It might have been as you say. There was a strange, rough bashfulness\r\nabout him. He confused and puzzled me. He never spoke out. He seemed\r\nto treat me as if our future lives had been provided for while we were\r\nchildren. What could I do, Lucy?”\r\n\r\n“Do? You could have asked your father to end the difficulty for you.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible! You forget what I have just told you. My father was\r\nsuffering at that time under the illness which afterward caused his\r\ndeath. He was quite unfit to interfere.”\r\n\r\n“Was there no one else who could help you?”\r\n\r\n“No one.”\r\n\r\n“No lady in whom you could confide?”\r\n\r\n“I had acquaintances among the ladies in the neighborhood. I had no\r\nfriends.”\r\n\r\n“What did you do, then?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing. I hesitated; I put off coming to an explanation with him,\r\nunfortunately, until it was too late.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by too late?”\r\n\r\n“You shall hear. I ought to have told you that Richard Wardour is in the\r\nnavy--”\r\n\r\n“Indeed! I am more interested in him than ever. Well?”\r\n\r\n“One spring day Richard came to our house to take leave of us before he\r\njoined his ship. I thought he was gone, and I went into the next room.\r\nIt was my own sitting-room, and it opened on to the garden.”--\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Richard must have been watching me. He suddenly appeared in the garden.\r\nWithout waiting for me to invite him, he walked into the room. I was a\r\nlittle startled as well as surprised, but I managed to hide it. I said,\r\n‘What is it, Mr. Wardour?’ He stepped close up to me; he said, in his\r\nquick, rough way: ‘Clara! I am going to the African coast. If I live,\r\nI shall come back promoted; and we both know what will happen then.’\r\nHe kissed me. I was half frightened, half angry. Before I could compose\r\nmyself to say a word, he was out in the garden again--he was gone! I\r\nought to have spoken, I know. It was not honorable, not kind toward him.\r\nYou can’t reproach me for my want of courage and frankness more bitterly\r\nthan I reproach myself!”\r\n\r\n“My dear child, I don’t reproach you. I only think you might have\r\nwritten to him.”\r\n\r\n“I did write.”\r\n\r\n“Plainly?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I told him in so many words that he was deceiving himself, and\r\nthat I could never marry him.”\r\n\r\n“Plain enough, in all conscience! Having said that, surely you are not\r\nto blame. What are you fretting about now?”\r\n\r\n“Suppose my letter has never reached him?”\r\n\r\n“Why should you suppose anything of the sort?”\r\n\r\n“What I wrote required an answer, Lucy--_asked_ for an answer. The\r\nanswer has never come. What is the plain conclusion? My letter has never\r\nreached him. And the _Atalanta_ is expected back! Richard Wardour is\r\nreturning to England--Richard Wardour will claim me as his wife! You\r\nwondered just now if I really meant what I said. Do you doubt it still?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford leaned back absently in her chair. For the first time\r\nsince the conversation had begun, she let a question pass without making\r\na reply. The truth is, Mrs. Crayford was thinking.\r\n\r\nShe saw Clara’s position plainly; she understood the disturbing effect\r\nof it on the mind of a young girl. Still, making all allowances,\r\nshe felt quite at a loss, so far, to account for Clara’s excessive\r\nagitation. Her quick observing faculty had just detected that Clara’s\r\nface showed no signs of relief, now that she had unburdened herself\r\nof her secret. There was something clearly under the surface\r\nhere--something of importance that still remained to be discovered. A\r\nshrewd doubt crossed Mrs. Crayford’s mind, and inspired the next words\r\nwhich she addressed to her young friend.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” she said abruptly, “have you told me all?”\r\n\r\nClara started as if the question terrified her. Feeling sure that she\r\nnow had the clew in her hand, Mrs. Crayford deliberately repeated her\r\nquestion, in another form of words. Instead of answering, Clara suddenly\r\nlooked up. At the same moment a faint flush of color appeared in her\r\nface for the first time.\r\n\r\nLooking up instinctively on her side, Mrs. Crayford became aware of the\r\npresence, in the conservatory, of a young gentleman who was claiming\r\nClara as his partner in the coming waltz. Mrs. Crayford fell into\r\nthinking once more. Had this young gentleman (she asked herself)\r\nanything to do with the untold end of the story? Was this the true\r\nsecret of Clara Burnham’s terror at the impending return of Richard\r\nWardour? Mrs. Crayford decided on putting her doubts to the test.\r\n\r\n“A friend of yours, my dear?” she asked, innocently. “Suppose you\r\nintroduce us to each other.”\r\n\r\nClara confusedly introduced the young gentleman.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Francis Aldersley, Lucy. Mr. Aldersley belongs to the Arctic\r\nexpedition.”\r\n\r\n“Attached to the expedition?” Mrs. Crayford repeated. “I am attached\r\nto the expedition too--in my way. I had better introduce myself, Mr.\r\nAldersley, as Clara seems to have forgotten to do it for me. I am Mrs.\r\nCrayford. My husband is Lieutenant Crayford, of the _Wanderer_. Do you\r\nbelong to that ship?”\r\n\r\n“I have not the honor, Mrs. Crayford. I belong to the _Sea-mew_.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford’s superb eyes looked shrewdly backward and forward between\r\nClara and Francis Aldersley, and saw the untold sequel to Clara’s story.\r\nThe young officer was a bright, handsome, gentleman-like lad. Just the\r\nperson to seriously complicate the difficulty with Richard Wardour!\r\nThere was no time for making any further inquiries. The band had begun\r\nthe prelude to the waltz, and Francis Aldersley was waiting for his\r\npartner. With a word of apology to the young man, Mrs. Crayford drew\r\nClara aside for a moment, and spoke to her in a whisper.\r\n\r\n“One word, my dear, before you return to the ball-room. It may sound\r\nconceited, after the little you have told me; but I think I understand\r\nyour position _now_, better than you do yourself. Do you want to hear my\r\nopinion?”\r\n\r\n“I am longing to hear it, Lucy! I want your opinion; I want your\r\nadvice.”\r\n\r\n“You shall have both in the plainest and fewest words. First, my\r\nopinion: You have no choice but to come to an explanation with Mr.\r\nWardour as soon as he returns. Second, my advice: If you wish to make\r\nthe explanation easy to both sides, take care that you make it in the\r\ncharacter of a free woman.”\r\n\r\nShe laid a strong emphasis on the last three words, and looked pointedly\r\nat Francis Aldersley as she pronounced them. “I won’t keep you from your\r\npartner any longer, Clara,” she resumed, and led the way back to the\r\nball-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe burden on Clara’s mind weighs on it more heavily than ever, after\r\nwhat Mrs. Crayford has said to her. She is too unhappy to feel the\r\ninspiriting influence of the dance. After a turn round the room, she\r\ncomplains of fatigue. Mr. Francis Aldersley looks at the conservatory\r\n(still as invitingly cool and empty as ever); leads her back to it;\r\nand places her on a seat among the shrubs. She tries--very feebly--to\r\ndismiss him.\r\n\r\n“Don’t let me keep you from dancing, Mr. Aldersley.”\r\n\r\nHe seats himself by her side, and feasts his eyes on the lovely downcast\r\nface that dares not turn toward him. He whispers to her:\r\n\r\n“Call me Frank.”\r\n\r\nShe longs to call him Frank--she loves him with all her heart. But Mrs.\r\nCrayford’s warning words are still in her mind. She never opens her\r\nlips. Her lover moves a little closer, and asks another favor. Men are\r\nall alike on these occasions. Silence invariably encourages them to try\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“Clara! have you forgotten what I said at the concert yesterday? May I\r\nsay it again?”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“We sail to-morrow for the Arctic seas. I may not return for years.\r\nDon’t send me away without hope! Think of the long, lonely time in the\r\ndark North! Make it a happy time for _me_.”\r\n\r\nThough he speaks with the fervor of a man, he is little more than a lad:\r\nhe is only twenty years old, and he is going to risk his young life on\r\nthe frozen deep! Clara pities him as she never pitied any human creature\r\nbefore. He gently takes her hand. She tries to release it.\r\n\r\n“What! not even that little favor on the last night?”\r\n\r\nHer faithful heart takes his part, in spite of her. Her hand remains in\r\nhis, and feels its soft persuasive pressure. She is a lost woman. It is\r\nonly a question of time now!\r\n\r\n“Clara! do you love me?”\r\n\r\nThere is a pause. She shrinks from looking at him--she trembles with\r\nstrange contradictory sensations of pleasure and pain. His arm steals\r\nround her; he repeats his question in a whisper; his lips almost touch\r\nher little rosy ear as he says it again:\r\n\r\n“Do you love me?”\r\n\r\nShe closes her eyes faintly--she hears nothing but those words--feels\r\nnothing but his arm round her--forgets Mrs. Crayford’s warning--forgets\r\nRichard Wardour himself--turns suddenly, with a loving woman’s desperate\r\ndisregard of everything but her love--nestles her head on his bosom, and\r\nanswers him in that way, at last!\r\n\r\nHe lifts the beautiful drooping head--their lips meet in their first\r\nkiss--they are both in heaven: it is Clara who brings them back to earth\r\nagain with a start--it is Clara who says, “Oh! what have I done?”--as\r\nusual, when it is too late.\r\n\r\nFrank answers the question.\r\n\r\n“You have made me happy, my angel. Now, when I come back, I come back to\r\nmake you my wife.”\r\n\r\nShe shudders. She remembers Richard Wardour again at those words.\r\n\r\n“Mind!” she says, “nobody is to know we are engaged till I permit you to\r\nmention it. Remember that!”\r\n\r\nHe promises to remember it. His arm tries to wind round her once\r\nmore. No! She is mistress of herself; she can positively dismiss him\r\nnow--after she has let him kiss her!\r\n\r\n“Go!” she says. “I want to see Mrs. Crayford. Find her! Say I am here,\r\nwaiting to speak to her. Go at once, Frank--for my sake!”\r\n\r\nThere is no alternative but to obey her. His eyes drink a last draught\r\nof her beauty. He hurries away on his errand--the happiest man in the\r\nroom. Five minutes since she was only his partner in the dance. He has\r\nspoken--and she has pledged herself to be his partner for life!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to find Mrs. Crayford in the crowd. Searching here, and\r\nsearching there, Frank became conscious of a stranger, who appeared\r\nto be looking for somebody, on his side. He was a dark, heavy-browed,\r\nstrongly-built man, dressed in a shabby old naval officer’s uniform.\r\nHis manner--strikingly resolute and self-contained--was unmistakably\r\nthe manner of a gentleman. He wound his way slowly through the crowd;\r\nstopping to look at every lady whom he passed, and then looking\r\naway again with a frown. Little by little he approached the\r\nconservatory--entered it, after a moment’s reflection--detected the\r\nglimmer of a white dress in the distance, through the shrubs and\r\nflowers--advanced to get a nearer view of the lady--and burst into\r\nClara’s presence with a cry of delight.\r\n\r\nShe sprang to her feet. She stood before him speechless, motionless,\r\nstruck to stone. All her life was in her eyes--the eyes which told her\r\nshe was looking at Richard Wardour.\r\n\r\nHe was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry I startled you, my darling. I forgot everything but the\r\nhappiness of seeing you again. We only reached our moorings two hours\r\nsince. I was some time inquiring after you, and some time getting my\r\nticket when they told me you were at the ball. Wish me joy, Clara! I am\r\npromoted. I have come back to make you my wife.”\r\n\r\nA momentary change passed over the blank terror of her face. Her color\r\nrose faintly, her lips moved. She abruptly put a question to him.\r\n\r\n“Did you get my letter?”\r\n\r\nHe started. “A letter from you? I never received it.”\r\n\r\nThe momentary animation died out of her face again. She drew back from\r\nhim and dropped into a chair. He advanced toward her, astonished and\r\nalarmed. She shrank in the chair--shrank, as if she was frightened of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Clara, you have not even shaken hands with me! What does it mean?”\r\n\r\nHe paused; waiting and watching her. She made no reply. A flash of the\r\nquick temper in him leaped up in his eyes. He repeated his last words in\r\nlouder and sterner tones:\r\n\r\n“What does it mean?”\r\n\r\nShe replied this time. His tone had hurt her--his tone had roused her\r\nsinking courage.\r\n\r\n“It means, Mr. Wardour, that you have been mistaken from the first.”\r\n\r\n“How have I been mistaken?”\r\n\r\n“You have been under a wrong impression, and you have given me no\r\nopportunity of setting you right.”\r\n\r\n“In what way have I been wrong?”\r\n\r\n“You have been too hasty and too confident about yourself and about me.\r\nYou have entirely misunderstood me. I am grieved to distress you,\r\nbut for your sake I must speak plainly. I am your friend always, Mr.\r\nWardour. I can never be your wife.”\r\n\r\nHe mechanically repeated the last words. He seemed to doubt whether he\r\nhad heard her aright.\r\n\r\n“You can never be my wife?”\r\n\r\n“Never!”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. She was incapable of telling him a falsehood. She\r\nwas ashamed to tell him the truth.\r\n\r\nHe stooped over her, and suddenly possessed himself of her hand. Holding\r\nher hand firmly, he stooped a little lower; searching for the signs\r\nwhich might answer him in her face. His own face darkened slowly while\r\nhe looked. He was beginning to suspect her; and he acknowledged it in\r\nhis next words.\r\n\r\n“Something has changed you toward me, Clara. Somebody has influenced you\r\nagainst me. Is it--you force me to ask the question--is it some other\r\nman?”\r\n\r\n“You have no right to ask me that.”\r\n\r\nHe went on without noticing what she had said to him.\r\n\r\n“Has that other man come between you and me? I speak plainly on my side.\r\nSpeak plainly on yours.”\r\n\r\n“I _have_ spoken. I have nothing more to say.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. She saw the warning light which told of the fire\r\nwithin him, growing brighter and brighter in his eyes. She felt his\r\ngrasp strengthening on her hand. He appealed to her for the last time.\r\n\r\n“Reflect,” he said, “reflect before it is too late. Your silence will\r\nnot serve you. If you persist in not answering me, I shall take your\r\nsilence as a confession. Do you hear me?”\r\n\r\n“I hear you.”\r\n\r\n“Clara Burnham! I am not to be trifled with. Clara Burnham! I insist on\r\nthe truth. Are you false to me?”\r\n\r\nShe resented that searching question with a woman’s keen sense of the\r\ninsult that is implied in doubting her to her face.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Wardour! you forget yourself when you call me to account in that\r\nway. I never encouraged you. I never gave you promise or pledge--”\r\n\r\nHe passionately interrupted her before she could say more.\r\n\r\n“You have engaged yourself in my absence. Your words own it; your looks\r\nown it! You have engaged yourself to another man!”\r\n\r\n“If I _have_ engaged myself, what right have you to complain of it?” she\r\nanswered firmly. “What right have you to control my actions--?”\r\n\r\nThe next words died away on her lips. He suddenly dropped her hand. A\r\nmarked change appeared in the expression of his eyes--a change which\r\ntold her of the terrible passions that she had let loose in him. She\r\nread, dimly read, something in his face which made her tremble--not for\r\nherself, but for Frank.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the dark color faded out of his face. His deep voice\r\ndropped suddenly to a low and quiet tone as he spoke the parting words.\r\n\r\n“Say no more, Miss Burnham--you have said enough. I am answered; I am\r\ndismissed.” He paused, and, stepping close up to her, laid his hand on\r\nher arm.\r\n\r\n“The time may come,” he said, “when I shall forgive you. But the man who\r\nhas robbed me of you shall rue the day when you and he first met.”\r\n\r\nHe turned and left her.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, Mrs. Crayford, entering the conservatory, was met\r\nby one of the attendants at the ball. The man stopped as if he wished to\r\nspeak to her.\r\n\r\n“What do you want?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, ma’am. Do you happen to have a smelling-bottle about\r\nyou? There is a young lady in the conservatory who is taken faint.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the Scenes--The Landing Stage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning of the next day--the morning on which the ships were to\r\nsail--came bright and breezy. Mrs. Crayford, having arranged to follow\r\nher husband to the water-side, and see the last of him before he\r\nembarked, entered Clara’s room on her way out of the house, anxious\r\nto hear how her young friend passed the night. To her astonishment she\r\nfound Clara had risen, and was dressed, like herself, to go out.\r\n\r\n“What does this mean, my dear? After what you suffered last night--after\r\nthe shock of seeing that man--why don’t you take my advice and rest in\r\nyour bed?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t rest. I have not slept all night. Have you been out yet?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Have you seen or heard anything of Richard Wardour?”\r\n\r\n“What an extraordinary question!”\r\n\r\n“Answer my question! Don’t trifle with me!”\r\n\r\n“Compose yourself, Clara. I have neither seen nor heard anything of\r\nRichard Wardour. Take my word for it, he is far enough away by this\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“No! He is here! He is near us! All night long the presentiment has\r\npursued me--Frank and Richard Wardour will meet.”\r\n\r\n“My dear child! what are you thinking of? They are total strangers to\r\neach other.”\r\n\r\n“Something will happen to bring them together. I feel it! I know it!\r\nThey will meet--there will be a mortal quarrel between them--and I shall\r\nbe to blame. Oh, Lucy! why didn’t I take your advice? Why was I\r\nmad enough to let Frank know that I loved him? Are you going to the\r\nlanding-stage? I am all ready--I must go with you.”\r\n\r\n“You must not think of it, Clara. There will be crowding and confusion\r\nat the water-side. You are not strong enough to bear it. Wait--I won’t\r\nbe long away--wait till I come back.”\r\n\r\n“I must and will go with you! Crowd? _He_ will be among the crowd!\r\nConfusion? In that confusion _he_ will find his way to Frank! Don’t ask\r\nme to wait. I shall go mad if I wait. I shall not know a moment’s ease\r\nuntil I have seen Frank, with my own eyes, safe in the boat which takes\r\nhim to his ship! You have got your bonnet on; what are we stopping here\r\nfor? Come! or I shall go without you. Look at the clock; we have not a\r\nmoment to lose!”\r\n\r\nIt was useless to contend with her. Mrs. Crayford yielded. The two women\r\nleft the house together.\r\n\r\nThe landing-stage, as Mrs. Crayford had predicted, was thronged with\r\nspectators. Not only the relatives and friends of the Arctic voyagers,\r\nbut strangers as well, had assembled in large numbers to see the ships\r\nsail. Clara’s eyes wandered affrightedly hither and thither among the\r\nstrange faces in the crowd; searching for the one face that she dreaded\r\nto see, and not finding it. So completely were her nerves unstrung, that\r\nshe started with a cry of alarm on suddenly hearing Frank’s voice behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“The _Sea-mew_‘s boats are waiting,” he said. “I must go, darling. How\r\npale you are looking, Clara! Are you ill?”\r\n\r\nShe never answered. She questioned him with wild eyes and trembling\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n“Has anything happened to you, Frank? anything out of the common?”\r\n\r\nFrank laughed at the strange question.\r\n\r\n“Anything out of the common?” he repeated. “Nothing that I know\r\nof, except sailing for the Arctic seas. That’s out of the common, I\r\nsuppose--isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Has anybody spoken to you since last night? Has any stranger followed\r\nyou in the street?”\r\n\r\nFrank turned in blank amazement to Mrs. Crayford.\r\n\r\n“What on earth does she mean?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford’s lively invention supplied her with an answer on the spur\r\nof the moment.\r\n\r\n“Do you believe in dreams, Frank? Of course you don’t! Clara has been\r\ndreaming about you; and Clara is foolish enough to believe in dreams.\r\nThat’s all--it’s not worth talking about. Hark! they are calling you.\r\nSay good-by, or you will be too late for the boat.”\r\n\r\nFrank took Clara’s hand. Long afterward--in the dark Arctic days, in the\r\ndreary Arctic nights--he remembered how coldly and how passively that\r\nhand lay in his.\r\n\r\n“Courage, Clara!” he said, gayly. “A sailor’s sweetheart must accustom\r\nherself to partings. The time will soon pass. Good-by, my darling!\r\nGood-by, my wife!”\r\n\r\nHe kissed the cold hand; he looked his last--for many a long year,\r\nperhaps!--at the pale and beautiful face. “How she loves me!” he\r\nthought. “How the parting distresses her!” He still held her hand; he\r\nwould have lingered longer, if Mrs. Crayford had not wisely waived all\r\nceremony and pushed him away.\r\n\r\nThe two ladies followed him at a safe distance through the crowd, and\r\nsaw him step into the boat. The oars struck the water; Frank waved his\r\ncap to Clara. In a moment more a vessel at anchor hid the boat from\r\nview. They had seen the last of him on his way to the Frozen Deep!\r\n\r\n“No Richard Wardour in the boat,” said Mrs. Crayford. “No Richard\r\nWardour on the shore. Let this be a lesson to you, my dear. Never be\r\nfoolish enough to believe in presentiments again.”\r\n\r\nClara’s eyes still wandered suspiciously to and fro among the crowd.\r\n\r\n“Are you not satisfied yet?” asked Mrs. Crayford.\r\n\r\n“No,” Clara answered, “I am not satisfied yet.”\r\n\r\n“What! still looking for him? This is really too absurd. Here is my\r\nhusband coming. I shall tell him to call a cab, and send you home.”\r\n\r\nClara drew back a few steps.\r\n\r\n“I won’t be in the way, Lucy, while you are taking leave of your good\r\nhusband,” she said. “I will wait here.”\r\n\r\n“Wait here! What for?”\r\n\r\n“For something which I may yet see; or for something which I may still\r\nhear.”\r\n\r\n“Richard Wardour?”\r\n\r\n“Richard Wardour.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford turned to her husband without another word. Clara’s\r\ninfatuation was beyond the reach of remonstrance.\r\n\r\nThe boats of the _Wanderer_ took the place at the landing-stage vacated\r\nby the boats of the _Sea-mew_. A burst of cheering among the outer ranks\r\nof the crowd announced the arrival of the commander of the expedition\r\non the scene. Captain Helding appeared, looking right and left for his\r\nfirst lieutenant. Finding Crayford with his wife, the captain made his\r\napologies for interfering, with his best grace.\r\n\r\n“Give him up to his professional duties for one minute, Mrs. Crayford,\r\nand you shall have him back again for half an hour. The Arctic\r\nexpedition is to blame, my dear lady--not the captain--for parting man\r\nand wife. In Crayford’s place, I should have left it to the bachelors to\r\nfind the Northwest Passage, and have stopped at home with you!”\r\n\r\nExcusing himself in those bluntly complimentary terms, Captain Helding\r\ndrew the lieutenant aside a few steps, accidentally taking a direction\r\nthat led the two officers close to the place at which Clara was\r\nstanding. Both the captain and the lieutenant were too completely\r\nabsorbed in their professional business to notice her. Neither the one\r\nnor the other had the faintest suspicion that she could and did hear\r\nevery word of the talk that passed between them.\r\n\r\n“You received my note this morning?” the captain began.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, Captain Helding, or I should have been on board the ship\r\nbefore this.”\r\n\r\n“I am going on board myself at once,” the captain proceeded, “but I must\r\nask you to keep your boat waiting for half an hour more. You will be all\r\nthe longer with your wife, you know. I thought of that, Crayford.”\r\n\r\n“I am much obliged to you, Captain Helding. I suppose there is some\r\nother reason for inverting the customary order of things, and keeping\r\nthe lieutenant on shore after the captain is on board?”\r\n\r\n“Quite true! there _is_ another reason. I want you to wait for a\r\nvolunteer who has just joined us.”\r\n\r\n“A volunteer!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. He has his outfit to get in a hurry, and he may be half an hour\r\nlate.”\r\n\r\n“It’s rather a sudden appointment, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“No doubt. Very sudden.”\r\n\r\n“And--pardon me--it’s rather a long time (as we are situated) to keep\r\nthe ships waiting for one man?”\r\n\r\n“Quite true, again. But a man who is worth having is worth waiting for.\r\nThis man is worth having; this man is worth his weight in gold to such\r\nan expedition as ours. Seasoned to all climates and all fatigues--a\r\nstrong fellow, a brave fellow, a clever fellow--in short, an excellent\r\nofficer. I know him well, or I should never have taken him. The country\r\ngets plenty of work out of my new volunteer, Crayford. He only returned\r\nyesterday from foreign service.”\r\n\r\n“He only returned yesterday from foreign service! And he volunteers this\r\nmorning to join the Arctic expedition? You astonish me.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say I do! You can’t be more astonished than I was, when he\r\npresented himself at my hotel and told me what he wanted. ‘Why, my good\r\nfellow, you have just got home,’ I said. ‘Are you weary of your freedom,\r\nafter only a few hours’ experience of it?’ His answer rather startled\r\nme. He said, ‘I am weary of my life, sir. I have come home and found\r\na trouble to welcome me, which goes near to break my heart. If I don’t\r\ntake refuge in absence and hard work, I am a lost man. Will you give me\r\na refuge?’ That’s what he said, Crayford, word for word.”\r\n\r\n“Did you ask him to explain himself further?”\r\n\r\n“Not I! I knew his value, and I took the poor devil on the spot, without\r\npestering him with any more questions. No need to ask him to explain\r\nhimself. The facts speak for themselves in these cases. The old story,\r\nmy good friend! There’s a woman at the bottom of it, of course.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford, waiting for the return of her husband as patiently as she\r\ncould, was startled by feeling a hand suddenly laid on her shoulder.\r\nShe looked round, and confronted Clara. Her first feeling of surprise\r\nchanged instantly to alarm. Clara was trembling from head to foot.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter? What has frightened you, my dear?”\r\n\r\n“Lucy! I _have_ heard of him!”\r\n\r\n“Richard Wardour again?”\r\n\r\n“Remember what I told you. I have heard every word of the conversation\r\nbetween Captain Helding and your husband. A man came to the captain this\r\nmorning and volunteered to join the _Wanderer_. The captain has taken\r\nhim. The man is Richard Wardour.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean it! Are you sure? Did you hear Captain Helding mention\r\nhis name?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Then how do you know it’s Richard Wardour?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t ask me! I am as certain of it, as that I am standing here! They\r\nare going away together, Lucy--away to the eternal ice and snow. My\r\nforeboding has come true! The two will meet--the man who is to marry me\r\nand the man whose heart I have broken!”\r\n\r\n“Your foreboding has _not_ come true, Clara! The men have not met\r\nhere--the men are not likely to meet elsewhere. They are appointed\r\nto separate ships. Frank belongs to the _Sea-mew_, and Wardour to the\r\n_Wanderer_. See! Captain Helding has done. My husband is coming this\r\nway. Let me make sure. Let me speak to him.”\r\n\r\nLieutenant Crayford returned to his wife. She spoke to him instantly.\r\n\r\n“William! you have got a new volunteer who joins the _Wanderer_?”\r\n\r\n“What! you have been listening to the captain and me?”\r\n\r\n“I want to know his name?”\r\n\r\n“How in the world did you manage to hear what we said to each other?”\r\n\r\n“His name? has the captain given you his name?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t excite yourself, my dear. Look! you are positively alarming Miss\r\nBurnham. The new volunteer is a perfect stranger to us. There is his\r\nname--last on the ship’s list.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford snatched the list out of her husband’s hand, and read the\r\nname:\r\n\r\n“RICHARD WARDOUR.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond Scene--The Hut of the _Sea-mew_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood-by to England! Good-by to inhabited and civilized regions of the\r\nearth!\r\n\r\nTwo years have passed since the voyagers sailed from their native\r\nshores. The enterprise has failed--the Arctic expedition is lost and\r\nice-locked in the Polar wastes. The good ships _Wanderer_ and _Sea-mew_,\r\nentombed in ice, will never ride the buoyant waters more. Stripped of\r\ntheir lighter timbers, both vessels have been used for the construction\r\nof huts, erected on the nearest land.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the two buildings which now shelter the lost men is\r\noccupied by the surviving officers and crew of the _Sea-mew_. On one\r\nside of the principal room are the sleeping berths and the fire-place.\r\nThe other side discloses a broad doorway (closed by a canvas screen),\r\nwhich serves as a means of communication with an inner apartment,\r\ndevoted to the superior officers. A hammock is slung to the rough\r\nraftered roof of the main room, as an extra bed. A man, completely\r\nhidden by his bedclothes, is sleeping in the hammock. By the fireside\r\nthere is a second man--supposed to be on the watch--fast asleep, poor\r\nwretch! at the present moment. Behind the sleeper stands an old cask,\r\nwhich serves for a table. The objects at present on the table are, a\r\npestle and mortar, and a saucepanful of the dry bones of animals--in\r\nplain words, the dinner for the day. By way of ornament to the dull\r\nbrown walls, icicles appear in the crevices of the timber, gleaming at\r\nintervals in the red fire-light. No wind whistles outside the lonely\r\ndwelling--no cry of bird or beast is heard. Indoors, and out-of-doors,\r\nthe awful silence of the Polar desert reigns, for the moment,\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first sound that broke the silence came from the inner apartment. An\r\nofficer lifted the canvas screen in the hut of the _Sea-mew_ and entered\r\nthe main room. Cold and privation had badly thinned the ranks. The\r\ncommander of the ship--Captain Ebsworth--was dangerously ill. The first\r\nlieutenant was dead. An officer of the _Wanderer_ filled their places\r\nfor the time, with Captain Helding’s permission. The officer so employed\r\nwas--Lieutenant Crayford.\r\n\r\nHe approached the man at the fireside, and awakened him.\r\n\r\n“Jump up, Bateson! It’s your turn to be relieved.”\r\n\r\nThe relief appeared, rising from a heap of old sails at the back of the\r\nhut. Bateson vanished, yawning, to his bed. Lieutenant Crayford walked\r\nbackward and forward briskly, trying what exercise would do toward\r\nwarming his blood.\r\n\r\nThe pestle and mortar on the cask attracted his attention. He stopped\r\nand looked up at the man in the hammock.\r\n\r\n“I must rouse the cook,” he said to himself, with a smile. “That fellow\r\nlittle thinks how useful he is in keeping up my spirits. The most\r\ninveterate croaker and grumbler in the world--and yet, according to his\r\nown account, the only cheerful man in the whole ship’s company. John\r\nWant! John Want! Rouse up, there!”\r\n\r\nA head rose slowly out of the bedclothes, covered with a red night-cap.\r\nA melancholy nose rested itself on the edge of the hammock. A voice,\r\nworthy of the nose, expressed its opinion of the Arctic climate, in\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n“Lord! Lord! here’s all my breath on my blanket. Icicles, if you please,\r\nsir, all round my mouth and all over my blanket. Every time I have\r\nsnored, I’ve frozen something. When a man gets the cold into him to that\r\nextent that he ices his own bed, it can’t last much longer. Never mind!\r\n_I_ don’t grumble.”\r\n\r\nCrayford tapped the saucepan of bones impatiently. John Want lowered\r\nhimself to the floor--grumbling all the way--by a rope attached to the\r\nrafters at his bed head. Instead of approaching his superior officer\r\nand his saucepan, he hobbled, shivering, to the fire-place, and held his\r\nchin as close as he possibly could over the fire. Crayford looked after\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Halloo! what are you doing there?”\r\n\r\n“Thawing my beard, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Come here directly, and set to work on these bones.”\r\n\r\nJohn Want remained immovably attached to the fire-place, holding\r\nsomething else over the fire. Crayford began to lose his temper.\r\n\r\n“What the devil are you about now?”\r\n\r\n“Thawing my watch, sir. It’s been under my pillow all night, and the\r\ncold has stopped it. Cheerful, wholesome, bracing sort of climate to\r\nlive in; isn’t it, sir? Never mind! _I_ don’t grumble.”\r\n\r\n“No, we all know that. Look here! Are these bones pounded small enough?”\r\n\r\nJohn Want suddenly approached the lieutenant, and looked at him with an\r\nappearance of the deepest interest.\r\n\r\n“You’ll excuse me, sir,” he said; “how very hollow your voice sounds\r\nthis morning!”\r\n\r\n“Never mind my voice. The bones! the bones!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir--the bones. They’ll take a trifle more pounding. I’ll do my\r\nbest with them, sir, for your sake.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\nJohn Want shook his head, and looked at Crayford with a dreary smile.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I shall have the honor of making much more bone soup for\r\nyou, sir. Do you think yourself you’ll last long, sir? I don’t, saving\r\nyour presence. I think about another week or ten days will do for us\r\nall. Never mind! _I_ don’t grumble.”\r\n\r\nHe poured the bones into the mortar, and began to pound them--under\r\nprotest. At the same moment a sailor appeared, entering from the inner\r\nhut.\r\n\r\n“A message from Captain Ebsworth, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“The captain is worse than ever with his freezing pains, sir. He wants\r\nto see you immediately.”\r\n\r\n“I will go at once. Rouse the doctor.”\r\n\r\nAnswering in those terms, Crayford returned to the inner hut, followed\r\nby the sailor. John Want shook his head again, and smiled more drearily\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\n“Rouse the doctor?” he repeated. “Suppose the doctor should be frozen?\r\nHe hadn’t a ha’porth of warmth in him last night, and his voice sounded\r\nlike a whisper in a speaking-trumpet. Will the bones do now? Yes, the\r\nbones will do now. Into the saucepan with you,” cried John Want, suiting\r\nthe action to the word, “and flavor the hot water if you can! When I\r\nremember that I was once an apprentice at a pastry-cook’s--when I think\r\nof the gallons of turtle-soup that this hand has stirred up in a jolly\r\nhot kitchen--and when I find myself mixing bones and hot water for\r\nsoup, and turning into ice as fast as I can; if I wasn’t of a cheerful\r\ndisposition I should feel inclined to grumble. John Want! John Want!\r\nwhatever had you done with your natural senses when you made up your\r\nmind to go to sea?”\r\n\r\nA new voice hailed the cook, speaking from one of the bed-places in the\r\nside of the hut. It was the voice of Francis Aldersley.\r\n\r\n“Who’s that croaking over the fire?”\r\n\r\n“Croaking?” repeated John Want, with the air of a man who considered\r\nhimself the object of a gratuitous insult. “Croaking? You don’t find\r\nyour own voice at all altered for the worse--do you, Mr. Frank? I don’t\r\ngive _him_,” John proceeded, speaking confidentially to himself, “more\r\nthan six hours to last. He’s one of your grumblers.”\r\n\r\n“What are you doing there?” asked Frank.\r\n\r\n“I’m making bone soup, sir, and wondering why I ever went to sea.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and why did you go to sea?”\r\n\r\n“I’m not certain, Mr. Frank. Sometimes I think it was natural\r\nperversity; sometimes I think it was false pride at getting over\r\nsea-sickness; sometimes I think it was reading ‘Robinson Crusoe,’ and\r\nbooks warning of me _not_ to go to sea.”\r\n\r\nFrank laughed. “You’re an odd fellow. What do you mean by false pride\r\nat getting over sea-sickness? Did you get over sea-sickness in some new\r\nway?”\r\n\r\nJohn Want’s dismal face brightened in spite of himself. Frank had\r\nrecalled to the cook’s memory one of the noteworthy passages in the\r\ncook’s life.\r\n\r\n“That’s it, sir!” he said. “If ever a man cured sea-sickness in a\r\nnew way yet, I am that man--I got over it, Mr. Frank, by dint of hard\r\neating. I was a passenger on board a packet-boat, sir, when first I saw\r\nblue water. A nasty lopp of a sea came on at dinner-time, and I began\r\nto feel queer the moment the soup was put on the table. ‘Sick?’ says\r\nthe captain. ‘Rather, sir,’ says I. ‘Will you try my cure?’ says the\r\ncaptain. ‘Certainly, sir,’ says I. ‘Is your heart in your mouth yet?’\r\nsays the captain. ‘Not quite, sir,’ says I. ‘Mock-turtle soup?’ says\r\nthe captain, and helps me. I swallow a couple of spoonfuls, and turn as\r\nwhite as a sheet. The captain cocks his eye at me. ‘Go on deck, sir,’\r\nsays he; ‘get rid of the soup, and then come back to the cabin.’ I got\r\nrid of the soup, and came back to the cabin. ‘Cod’s head-and-shoulders,’\r\nsays the captain, and helps me. ‘I can’t stand it, sir,’ says I. ‘You\r\nmust,’ says the captain, ‘because it’s the cure.’ I crammed down a\r\nmouthful, and turned paler than ever. ‘Go on deck,’ says the captain.\r\n‘Get rid of the cod’s head, and come back to the cabin.’ Off I go, and\r\nback I come. ‘Boiled leg of mutton and trimmings,’ says the captain, and\r\nhelps me. ‘No fat, sir,’ says I. ‘Fat’s the cure,’ says the captain, and\r\nmakes me eat it. ‘Lean’s the cure,’ says the captain, and makes me eat\r\nit. ‘Steady?’ says the captain. ‘Sick,’ says I. ‘Go on deck,’ says the\r\ncaptain; ‘get rid of the boiled leg of mutton and trimmings and come\r\nback to the cabin.’ Off I go, staggering--back I come, more dead than\r\nalive. ‘Deviled kidneys,’ says the captain. I shut my eyes, and got ‘em\r\ndown. ‘Cure’s beginning,’ says the captain. ‘Mutton-chop and pickles.’\r\nI shut my eyes, and got _them_ down. ‘Broiled ham and cayenne pepper,’\r\nsays the captain. ‘Glass of stout and cranberry tart. Want to go on deck\r\nagain?’ ‘No, sir,’ says I. ‘Cure’s done,’ says the captain. ‘Never\r\nyou give in to your stomach, and your stomach will end in giving in to\r\nyou.’”\r\n\r\nHaving stated the moral purpose of his story in those unanswerable\r\nwords, John Want took himself and his saucepan into the kitchen.\r\nA moment later, Crayford returned to the hut and astonished Frank\r\nAldersley by an unexpected question.\r\n\r\n“Have you anything in your berth, Frank, that you set a value on?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing that I set the smallest value on--when I am out of it,” he\r\nreplied. “What does your question mean?”\r\n\r\n“We are almost as short of fuel as we are of provisions,” Crayford\r\nproceeded. “Your berth will make good firing. I have directed Bateson to\r\nbe here in ten minutes with his ax.”\r\n\r\n“Very attentive and considerate on your part,” said Frank. “What is\r\nto become of me, if you please, when Bateson has chopped my bed into\r\nfire-wood?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you guess?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose the cold has stupefied me. The riddle is beyond my reading.\r\nSuppose you give me a hint?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. There will be beds to spare soon--there is to be a change at\r\nlast in our wretched lives here. Do you see it now?”\r\n\r\nFrank’s eyes sparkled. He sprang out of his berth, and waved his fur cap\r\nin triumph.\r\n\r\n“See it?” he exclaimed; “of course I do! The exploring party is to start\r\nat last. Do I go with the expedition?”\r\n\r\n“It is not very long since you were in the doctor’s hands, Frank,” said\r\nCrayford, kindly. “I doubt if you are strong enough yet to make one of\r\nthe exploring party.”\r\n\r\n“Strong enough or not,” returned Frank, “any risk is better than pining\r\nand perishing here. Put me down, Crayford, among those who volunteer to\r\ngo.”\r\n\r\n“Volunteers will not be accepted, in this case,” said Crayford. “Captain\r\nHelding and Captain Ebsworth see serious objections, as we are situated,\r\nto that method of proceeding.”\r\n\r\n“Do they mean to keep the appointments in their own hands?” asked Frank.\r\n“I for one object to that.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a little,” said Crayford. “You were playing backgammon the other\r\nday with one of the officers. Does the board belong to him or to you?”\r\n\r\n“It belongs to me. I have got it in my locker here. What do you want\r\nwith it?”\r\n\r\n“I want the dice and the box for casting lots. The captains have\r\narranged--most wisely, as I think--that Chance shall decide among us who\r\ngoes with the expedition and who stays behind in the huts. The officers\r\nand crew of the _Wanderer_ will be here in a few minutes to cast the\r\nlots. Neither you nor any one can object to that way of deciding among\r\nus. Officers and men alike take their chance together. Nobody can\r\ngrumble.”\r\n\r\n“I am quite satisfied,” said Frank. “But I know of one man among the\r\nofficers who is sure to make objections.”\r\n\r\n“Who is the man?”\r\n\r\n“You know him well enough, too. The ‘Bear of the Expeditions’ Richard\r\nWardour.”\r\n\r\n“Frank! Frank! you have a bad habit of letting your tongue run away with\r\nyou. Don’t repeat that stupid nickname when you talk of my good friend,\r\nRichard Wardour.”\r\n\r\n“Your good friend? Crayford! your liking for that man amazes me.”\r\n\r\nCrayford laid his hand kindly on Frank’s shoulder. Of all the officers\r\nof the _Sea-mew_, Crayford’s favorite was Frank.\r\n\r\n“Why should it amaze you?” he asked. “What opportunities have you had of\r\njudging? You and Wardour have always belonged to different ships. I have\r\nnever seen you in Wardour’s society for five minutes together. How can\r\n_you_ form a fair estimate of his character?”\r\n\r\n“I take the general estimate of his character,” Frank answered. “He\r\nhas got his nickname because he is the most unpopular man in his ship.\r\nNobody likes him--there must be some reason for that.”\r\n\r\n“There is only one reason for it,” Crayford rejoined. “Nobody\r\nunderstands Richard Wardour. I am not talking at random. Remember,\r\nI sailed from England with him in the _Wanderer_; and I was only\r\ntransferred to the _Sea-mew_ long after we were locked up in the ice. I\r\nwas Richard Wardour’s companion on board ship for months, and I learned\r\nthere to do him justice. Under all his outward defects, I tell you,\r\nthere beats a great and generous heart. Suspend your opinion, my lad,\r\nuntil you know my friend as well as I do. No more of this now. Give me\r\nthe dice and the box.”\r\n\r\nFrank opened his locker. At the same moment the silence of the\r\nsnowy waste outside was broken by a shouting of voices hailing the\r\nhut--“_Sea-mew_, ahoy!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sailor on watch opened the outer door. There, plodding over the\r\nghastly white snow, were the officers of the _Wanderer_ approaching the\r\nhut. There, scattered under the merciless black sky, were the crew, with\r\nthe dogs and the sledges, waiting the word which was to start them on\r\ntheir perilous and doubtful journey.\r\n\r\nCaptain Helding of the _Wanderer_, accompanied by his officers, entered\r\nthe hut, in high spirits at the prospect of a change. Behind them,\r\nlounging in slowly by himself, was a dark, sullen, heavy-browed man. He\r\nneither spoke, nor offered his hand to anybody: he was the one person\r\npresent who seemed to be perfectly indifferent to the fate in store for\r\nhim. This was the man whom his brother officers had nicknamed the Bear\r\nof the Expedition. In other words--Richard Wardour.\r\n\r\nCrayford advanced to welcome Captain Helding. Frank, remembering the\r\nfriendly reproof which he had just received, passed over the other\r\nofficers of the _Wanderer_, and made a special effort to be civil to\r\nCrayford’s friend.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning, Mr. Wardour,” he said. “We may congratulate each other on\r\nthe chance of leaving this horrible place.”\r\n\r\n“_You_ may think it horrible,” Wardour retorted; “I like it.”\r\n\r\n“Like it? Good Heavens! why?”\r\n\r\n“Because there are no women here.”\r\n\r\nFrank turned to his brother officers, without making any further\r\nadvances in the direction of Richard Wardour. The Bear of the Expedition\r\nwas more unapproachable than ever.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the hut had become thronged by the able-bodied officers\r\nand men of the two ships. Captain Helding, standing in the midst of\r\nthem, with Crayford by his side, proceeded to explain the purpose of the\r\ncontemplated expedition to the audience which surrounded him.\r\n\r\nHe began in these words:\r\n\r\n“Brother officers and men of the _Wanderer_ and _Sea-mew_, it is my\r\nduty to tell you, very briefly, the reasons which have decided Captain\r\nEbsworth and myself on dispatching an exploring party in search of help.\r\nWithout recalling all the hardships we have suffered for the last two\r\nyears--the destruction, first of one of our ships, then of the other;\r\nthe death of some of our bravest and best companions; the vain battles\r\nwe have been fighting with the ice and snow, and boundless desolation of\r\nthese inhospitable regions--without dwelling on these things, it is\r\nmy duty to remind you that this, the last place in which we have taken\r\nrefuge, is far beyond the track of any previous expedition, and that\r\nconsequently our chance of being discovered by any rescuing parties that\r\nmay be sent to look after us is, to say the least of it, a chance of the\r\nmost uncertain kind. You all agree with me, gentlemen, so far?”\r\n\r\nThe officers (with the exception of Wardour, who stood apart in sullen\r\nsilence) all agreed, so far.\r\n\r\nThe captain went on.\r\n\r\n“It is therefore urgently necessary that we should make another, and\r\nprobably a last, effort to extricate ourselves. The winter is not far\r\noff, game is getting scarcer and scarcer, our stock of provisions is\r\nrunning low, and the sick--especially, I am sorry to say, the sick in\r\nthe _Wanderer_‘s hut--are increasing in number day by day. We must look\r\nto our own lives, and to the lives of those who are dependent on us; and\r\nwe have no time to lose.”\r\n\r\nThe officers echoed the words cheerfully.\r\n\r\n“Right! right! No time to lose.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Helding resumed:\r\n\r\n“The plan proposed is, that a detachment of the able-bodied officers and\r\nmen among us should set forth this very day, and make another effort to\r\nreach the nearest inhabited settlements, from which help and provisions\r\nmay be dispatched to those who remain here. The new direction to be\r\ntaken, and the various precautions to be adopted, are all drawn out\r\nready. The only question now before us is, Who is to stop here, and who\r\nis to undertake the journey?”\r\n\r\nThe officers answered the question with one accord--“Volunteers!”\r\n\r\nThe men echoed their officers. “Ay, ay, volunteers.”\r\n\r\nWardour still preserved his sullen silence. Crayford noticed him.\r\nstanding apart from the rest, and appealed to him personally.\r\n\r\n“Do you say nothing?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” Wardour answered. “Go or stay, it’s all one to me.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you don’t really mean that?” said Crayford.\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to hear it, Wardour.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Helding answered the general suggestion in favor of volunteering\r\nby a question which instantly checked the rising enthusiasm of the\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, “suppose we say volunteers. Who volunteers to stop in\r\nthe huts?”\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence. The officers and men looked at each other\r\nconfusedly. The captain continued:\r\n\r\n“You see we can’t settle it by volunteering. You all want to go. Every\r\nman among us who has the use of his limbs naturally wants to go. But\r\nwhat is to become of those who have not got the use of their limbs? Some\r\nof us must stay here, and take care of the sick.”\r\n\r\nEverybody admitted that this was true.\r\n\r\n“So we get back again,” said the captain, “to the old question--Who\r\namong the able-bodied is to go? and who is to stay? Captain Ebsworth\r\nsays, and I say, let chance decide it. Here are dice. The numbers run\r\nas high as twelve--double sixes. All who throw under six, stay; all who\r\nthrow over six, go. Officers of the _Wanderer_ and the _Sea-mew_, do you\r\nagree to that way of meeting the difficulty?”\r\n\r\nAll the officers agreed, with the one exception of Wardour, who still\r\nkept silence.\r\n\r\n“Men of the _Wanderer_ and _Sea-mew_, your officers agree to cast lots.\r\nDo you agree too?”\r\n\r\nThe men agreed without a dissentient voice. Crayford handed the box and\r\nthe dice to Captain Helding.\r\n\r\n“You throw first, sir. Under six, ‘Stay.’ Over six, ‘Go.’”\r\n\r\nCaptain Helding cast the dice; the top of the cask serving for a table.\r\nHe threw seven.\r\n\r\n“Go,” said Crayford. “I congratulate you, sir. Now for my own chance.”\r\n He cast the dice in his turn. Three! “Stay! Ah, well! well! if I can do\r\nmy duty, and be of use to others, what does it matter whether I go or\r\nstay? Wardour, you are next, in the absence of your first lieutenant.”\r\n\r\nWardour prepared to cast, without shaking the dice.\r\n\r\n“Shake the box, man!” cried Crayford. “Give yourself a chance of luck!”\r\n\r\nWardour persisted in letting the dice fall out carelessly, just as they\r\nlay in the box.\r\n\r\n“Not I!” he muttered to himself. “I’ve done with luck.” Saying those\r\nwords, he threw down the empty box, and seated himself on the nearest\r\nchest, without looking to see how the dice had fallen.\r\n\r\nCrayford examined them. “Six!” he exclaimed. “There! you have a second\r\nchance, in spite of yourself. You are neither under nor over--you throw\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” growled the Bear. “It’s not worth the trouble of getting up for.\r\nSomebody else throw for me.” He suddenly looked at Frank. “You! you have\r\ngot what the women call a lucky face.”\r\n\r\nFrank appealed to Crayford. “Shall I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if he wishes it,” said Crayford.\r\n\r\nFrank cast the dice. “Two! He stays! Wardour, I am sorry I have thrown\r\nagainst you.”\r\n\r\n“Go or stay,” reiterated Wardour, “it’s all one to me. You will be\r\nluckier, young one, when you cast for yourself.”\r\n\r\nFrank cast for himself.\r\n\r\n“Eight. Hurrah! I go!”\r\n\r\n“What did I tell you?” said Wardour. “The chance was yours. You have\r\nthriven on my ill luck.”\r\n\r\nHe rose, as he spoke, to leave the hut. Crayford stopped him.\r\n\r\n“Have you anything particular to do, Richard?”\r\n\r\n“What has anybody to do here?”\r\n\r\n“Wait a little, then. I want to speak to you when this business is\r\nover.”\r\n\r\n“Are you going to give me any more good advice?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t look at me in that sour way, Richard. I am going to ask you a\r\nquestion about something which concerns yourself.”\r\n\r\nWardour yielded without a word more. He returned to his chest, and\r\ncynically composed himself to slumber. The casting of the lots went\r\non rapidly among the officers and men. In another half-hour chance had\r\ndecided the question of “Go” or “Stay” for all alike. The men left the\r\nhut. The officers entered the inner apartment for a last conference with\r\nthe bed-ridden captain of the _Sea-mew_. Wardour and Crayford were left\r\ntogether, alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrayford touched his friend on the shoulder to rouse him. Wardour looked\r\nup, impatiently, with a frown.\r\n\r\n“I was just asleep,” he said. “Why do you wake me?”\r\n\r\n“Look round you, Richard. We are alone.”\r\n\r\n“Well--and what of that?”\r\n\r\n“I wish to speak to you privately; and this is my opportunity. You have\r\ndisappointed and surprised me to-day. Why did you say it was all one to\r\nyou whether you went or stayed? Why are you the only man among us who\r\nseems to be perfectly indifferent whether we are rescued or not?”\r\n\r\n“Can a man always give a reason for what is strange in his manner or his\r\nwords?” Wardour retorted.\r\n\r\n“He can try,” said Crayford, quietly--“when his friend asks him.”\r\n\r\nWardour’s manner softened.\r\n\r\n“That’s true,” he said. “I _will_ try. Do you remember the first night\r\nat sea when we sailed from England in the _Wanderer_?”\r\n\r\n“As well as if it was yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“A calm, still night,” the other went on, thoughtfully. “No clouds, no\r\nstars. Nothing in the sky but the broad moon, and hardly a ripple to\r\nbreak the path of light she made in the quiet water. Mine was the middle\r\nwatch that night. You came on deck, and found me alone--”\r\n\r\nHe stopped. Crayford took his hand, and finished the sentence for him.\r\n\r\n“Alone--and in tears.”\r\n\r\n“The last I shall ever shed,” Wardour added, bitterly.\r\n\r\n“Don’t say that! There are times when a man is to be pitied indeed, if\r\nhe can shed no tears. Go on, Richard.”\r\n\r\nWardour proceeded--still following the old recollections, still\r\npreserving his gentler tones.\r\n\r\n“I should have quarreled with any other man who had surprised me at that\r\nmoment,” he said. “There was something, I suppose, in your voice when\r\nyou asked my pardon for disturbing me, that softened my heart. I told\r\nyou I had met with a disappointment which had broken me for life. There\r\nwas no need to explain further. The only hopeless wretchedness in this\r\nworld is the wretchedness that women cause.”\r\n\r\n“And the only unalloyed happiness,” said Crayford, “the happiness that\r\nwomen bring.”\r\n\r\n“That may be your experience of them,” Wardour answered; “mine is\r\ndifferent. All the devotion, the patience, the humility, the worship\r\nthat there is in man, I laid at the feet of a woman. She accepted\r\nthe offering as women do--accepted it, easily, gracefully,\r\nunfeelingly--accepted it as a matter of course. I left England to win\r\na high place in my profession, before I dared to win _her_. I braved\r\ndanger, and faced death. I staked my life in the fever swamps of Africa,\r\nto gain the promotion that I only desired for her sake--and gained it. I\r\ncame back to give her all, and to ask nothing in return, but to rest my\r\nweary heart in the sunshine of her smile. And her own lips--the lips I\r\nhad kissed at parting--told me that another man had robbed me of her. I\r\nspoke but few words when I heard that confession, and left her forever.\r\n‘The time may come,’ I told her, ‘when I shall forgive _you_. But the\r\nman who has robbed me of you shall rue the day when you and he first\r\nmet.’ Don’t ask me who he was! I have yet to discover him. The treachery\r\nhad been kept secret; nobody could tell me where to find him; nobody\r\ncould tell me who he was. What did it matter? When I had lived out the\r\nfirst agony, I could rely on myself--I could be patient, and bide my\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“Your time? What time?”\r\n\r\n“The time when I and that man shall meet face to face. I knew it then; I\r\nknow it now--it was written on my heart then, it is written on my heart\r\nnow--we two shall meet and know each other! With that conviction strong\r\nwithin me, I volunteered for this service, as I would have volunteered\r\nfor anything that set work and hardship and danger, like ramparts,\r\nbetween my misery and me. With that conviction strong within me still, I\r\ntell you it is no matter whether I stay here with the sick, or go hence\r\nwith the strong. I shall live till I have met that man! There is a day\r\nof reckoning appointed between us. Here in the freezing cold, or away in\r\nthe deadly heat; in battle or in shipwreck; in the face of starvation;\r\nunder the shadow of pestilence--I, though hundreds are falling round me,\r\nI shall live! live for the coming of one day! live for the meeting with\r\none man!”\r\n\r\nHe stopped, trembling, body and soul, under the hold that his own\r\nterrible superstition had fastened on him. Crayford drew back in silent\r\nhorror. Wardour noticed the action--he resented it--he appealed, in\r\ndefense of his one cherished conviction, to Crayford’s own experience of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Look at me!” he cried. “Look how I have lived and thriven, with\r\nthe heart-ache gnawing at me at home, and the winds of the icy north\r\nwhistling round me here! I am the strongest man among you. Why? I have\r\nfought through hardships that have laid the best-seasoned men of all our\r\nparty on their backs. Why? What have _I_ done, that my life should throb\r\nas bravely through every vein in my body at this minute, and in this\r\ndeadly place, as ever it did in the wholesome breezes of home? What am\r\nI preserved for? I tell you again, for the coming of one day--for the\r\nmeeting with one man.”\r\n\r\nHe paused once more. This time Crayford spoke.\r\n\r\n“Richard!” he said, “since we first met, I have believed in your better\r\nnature, against all outward appearance. I have believed in you, firmly,\r\ntruly, as your brother might. You are putting that belief to a hard\r\ntest. If your enemy had told me that you had ever talked as you talk\r\nnow, that you had ever looked as you look now, I would have turned my\r\nback on him as the utterer of a vile calumny against a just, a brave, an\r\nupright man. Oh! my friend, my friend, if ever I have deserved well of\r\nyou, put away these thoughts from your heart! Face me again, with the\r\nstainless look of a man who has trampled under his feet the bloody\r\nsuperstitions of revenge, and knows them no more! Never, never, let the\r\ntime come when I cannot offer you my hand as I offer it now, to the man\r\nI can still admire--to the brother I can still love!”\r\n\r\nThe heart that no other voice could touch felt that appeal. The fierce\r\neyes, the hard voice, softened under Crayford’s influence. Richard\r\nWardour’s head sank on his breast.\r\n\r\n“You are kinder to me than I deserve,” he said. “Be kinder still, and\r\nforget what I have been talking about. No! no more about me; I am not\r\nworth it. We’ll change the subject, and never go back to it again. Let’s\r\ndo something. Work, Crayford--that’s the true elixir of our life! Work,\r\nthat stretches the muscles and sets the blood a-glowing. Work, that\r\ntires the body and rests the mind. Is there nothing in hand that I can\r\ndo? Nothing to cut? nothing to carry?”\r\n\r\nThe door opened as he put the question. Bateson--appointed to chop\r\nFrank’s bed-place into firing--appeared punctually with his ax. Wardour,\r\nwithout a word of warning, snatched the ax out of the man’s hand.\r\n\r\n“What was this wanted for?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“To cut up Mr. Aldersley’s berth there into firing, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll do it for you! I’ll have it down in no time!” He turned to\r\nCrayford. “You needn’t be afraid about me, old friend. I am going to do\r\nthe right thing. I am going to tire my body and rest my mind.”\r\n\r\nThe evil spirit in him was plainly subdued--for the time, at least.\r\nCrayford took his hand in silence; and then (followed by Bateson) left\r\nhim to his work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nAx in hand, Wardour approached Frank’s bed-place.\r\n\r\n“If I could only cut the thoughts out of me,” he said to himself, “as I\r\nam going to cut the billets out of this wood!” He attacked the bed-place\r\nwith the ax, like a man who well knew the use of his instrument. “Oh\r\nme!” he thought, sadly, “if I had only been born a carpenter instead\r\nof a gentleman! A good ax, Master Bateson--I wonder where you got it?\r\nSomething like a grip, my man, on this handle. Poor Crayford! his words\r\nstick in my throat. A fine fellow! a noble fellow! No use thinking, no\r\nuse regretting; what is said, is said. Work! work! work!”\r\n\r\nPlank after plank fell out on the floor. He laughed over the easy task\r\nof destruction. “Aha! young Aldersley! It doesn’t take much to demolish\r\nyour bed-place. I’ll have it down! I would have the whole hut down, if\r\nthey would only give me the chance of chopping at it!”\r\n\r\nA long strip of wood fell to his ax--long enough to require cutting\r\nin two. He turned it, and stooped over it. Something caught his\r\neye--letters carved in the wood. He looked closer. The letters were very\r\nfaintly and badly cut. He could only make out the first three of them;\r\nand even of those he was not quite certain. They looked like C L A--if\r\nthey looked like anything. He threw down the strip of wood irritably.\r\n\r\n“D--n the fellow (whoever he is) who cut this! Why should he carve\r\n_that_ name, of all the names in the world?”\r\n\r\nHe paused, considering--then determined to go on again with his\r\nself-imposed labor. He was ashamed of his own outburst. He looked\r\neagerly for the ax. “Work, work! Nothing for it but work.” He found the\r\nax, and went on again.\r\n\r\nHe cut out another plank.\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and looked at it suspiciously.\r\n\r\nThere was carving again, on this plank. The letters F. and A. appeared\r\non it.\r\n\r\nHe put down the ax. There were vague misgivings in him which he was not\r\nable to realize. The state of his own mind was fast becoming a puzzle to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“More carving,” he said to himself. “That’s the way these young idlers\r\nemploy their long hours. F. A.? Those must be _his_ initials--Frank\r\nAldersley. Who carved the letters on the other plank? Frank Aldersley,\r\ntoo?”\r\n\r\nHe turned the piece of wood in his hand nearer to the light, and looked\r\nlower down it. More carving again, lower down! Under the initials F. A.\r\nwere two more letters--C. B.\r\n\r\n“C. B.?” he repeated to himself. “His sweet heart’s initials, I suppose?\r\nOf course--at his age--his sweetheart’s initials.”\r\n\r\nHe paused once more. A spasm of inner pain showed the shadow of its\r\nmysterious passage, outwardly on his face.\r\n\r\n“_Her_ cipher is C. B.,” he said, in low, broken tones. “C. B.--Clara\r\nBurnham.”\r\n\r\nHe waited, with the plank in his hand; repeating the name over and over\r\nagain, as if it was a question he was putting to himself.\r\n\r\n“Clara Burnham? Clara Burnham?”\r\n\r\nHe dropped the plank, and turned deadly pale in a moment. His eyes\r\nwandered furtively backward and forward between the strip of wood on the\r\nfloor and the half-demolished berth. “Oh, God! what has come to me now?”\r\n he said to himself, in a whisper. He snatched up the ax, with a strange\r\ncry--something between rage and terror. He tried--fiercely, desperately\r\ntried--to go on with his work. No! strong as he was, he could not use\r\nthe ax. His hands were helpless; they trembled incessantly. He went to\r\nthe fire; he held his hands over it. They still trembled incessantly;\r\nthey infected the rest of him. He shuddered all over. He knew fear. His\r\nown thoughts terrified him.\r\n\r\n“Crayford!” he cried out. “Crayford! come here, and let’s go hunting.”\r\n\r\nNo friendly voice answered him. No friendly face showed itself at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nAn interval passed; and there came over him another change. He recovered\r\nhis self-possession almost as suddenly as he had lost it. A smile--a\r\nhorrid, deforming, unnatural smile--spread slowly, stealthily,\r\ndevilishly over his face. He left the fire; he put the ax away softly in\r\na corner; he sat down in his old place, deliberately self-abandoned to a\r\nfrenzy of vindictive joy. He had found the man! There, at the end of\r\nthe world--there, at the last fight of the Arctic voyagers against\r\nstarvation and death, he had found the man!\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed.\r\n\r\nHe became conscious, on a sudden, of a freezing stream of air pouring\r\ninto the room.\r\n\r\nHe turned, and saw Crayford opening the door of the hut. A man was\r\nbehind him. Wardour rose eagerly, and looked over Crayford’s shoulder.\r\n\r\nWas it--could it be--the man who had carved the letters on the plank?\r\nYes! Frank Aldersley!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Still at work!” Crayford exclaimed, looking at the half-demolished\r\nbed-place. “Give yourself a little rest, Richard. The exploring party\r\nis ready to start. If you wish to take leave of your brother officers\r\nbefore they go, you have no time to lose.”\r\n\r\nHe checked himself there, looking Wardour full in the face.\r\n\r\n“Good Heavens!” he cried, “how pale you are! Has anything happened?”\r\n\r\nFrank--searching in his locker for articles of clothing which he might\r\nrequire on the journey--looked round. He was startled, as Crayford had\r\nbeen startled, by the sudden change in Wardour since they had last seen\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Are you ill?” he asked. “I hear you have been doing Bateson’s work for\r\nhim. Have you hurt yourself?”\r\n\r\nWardour suddenly moved his head, so as to hide his face from both\r\nCrayford and Frank. He took out his handkerchief, and wound it clumsily\r\nround his left hand.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said; “I hurt myself with the ax. It’s nothing. Never mind.\r\nPain always has a curious effect on me. I tell you it’s nothing! Don’t\r\nnotice it!”\r\n\r\nHe turned his face toward them again as suddenly as he had turned it\r\naway. He advanced a few steps, and addressed himself with an uneasy\r\nfamiliarity to Frank.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t answer you civilly when you spoke to me some little time\r\nsince. I mean when I first came in here along with the rest of them. I\r\napologize. Shake hands! How are you? Ready for the march?”\r\n\r\nFrank met the oddly abrupt advance which had been made to him with\r\nperfect good humor.\r\n\r\n“I am glad to be friends with you, Mr. Wardour. I wish I was as well\r\nseasoned to fatigue as you are.”\r\n\r\nWardour burst into a hard, joyless, unnatural laugh.\r\n\r\n“Not strong, eh? You don’t look it. The dice had better have sent me\r\naway, and kept you here. I never felt in better condition in my life.”\r\n He paused and added, with his eye on Frank and with a strong emphasis on\r\nthe words: “We men of Kent are made of tough material.”\r\n\r\nFrank advanced a step on his side, with a new interest in Richard\r\nWardour.\r\n\r\n“You come from Kent?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes. From East Kent.” He waited a little once more, and looked hard at\r\nFrank. “Do you know that part of the country?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I ought to know something about East Kent,” Frank answered. “Some dear\r\nfriends of mine once lived there.”\r\n\r\n“Friends of yours?” Wardour repeated. “One of the county families, I\r\nsuppose?”\r\n\r\nAs he put the question, he abruptly looked over his shoulder. He was\r\nstanding between Crayford and Frank. Crayford, taking no part in the\r\nconversation, had been watching him, and listening to him more and more\r\nattentively as that conversation went on. Within the last moment or\r\ntwo Wardour had become instinctively conscious of this. He resented\r\nCrayford’s conduct with needless irritability.\r\n\r\n“Why are you staring at me?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Why are you looking unlike yourself?” Crayford answered, quietly.\r\n\r\nWardour made no reply. He renewed the conversation with Frank.\r\n\r\n“One of the county families?” he resumed. “The Winterbys of Yew Grange,\r\nI dare say?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Frank; “but friends of the Witherbys, very likely. The\r\nBurnhams.”\r\n\r\nDesperately as he struggled to maintain it, Wardour’s self-control\r\nfailed him. He started violently. The clumsily-wound handkerchief fell\r\noff his hand. Still looking at him attentively, Crayford picked it up.\r\n\r\n“There is your handkerchief, Richard,” he said. “Strange!”\r\n\r\n“What is strange?”\r\n\r\n“You told us you had hurt yourself with the ax--”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“There is no blood on your handkerchief.”\r\n\r\nWardour snatched the handkerchief out of Crayford’s hand, and,\r\nturning away, approached the outer door of the hut. “No blood on the\r\nhandkerchief,” he said to himself. “There may be a stain or two when\r\nCrayford sees it again.” He stopped within a few paces of the door,\r\nand spoke to Crayford. “You recommended me to take leave of my brother\r\nofficers before it was too late,” he said. “I am going to follow your\r\nadvice.”\r\n\r\nThe door was opened from the outer side as he laid his hand on the lock.\r\n\r\nOne of the quartermasters of the _Wanderer_ entered the hut.\r\n\r\n“Is Captain Helding here, sir?” he asked, addressing himself to Wardour.\r\n\r\nWardour pointed to Crayford.\r\n\r\n“The lieutenant will tell you,” he said.\r\n\r\nCrayford advanced and questioned the quartermaster. “What do you want\r\nwith Captain Helding?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I have a report to make, sir. There has been an accident on the ice.”\r\n\r\n“To one of your men?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir. To one of our officers.”\r\n\r\nWardour, on the point of going out, paused when the quartermaster made\r\nthat reply. For a moment he considered with himself. Then he walked\r\nslowly back to the part of the room in which Frank was standing.\r\nCrayford, directing the quartermaster, pointed to the arched door way in\r\nthe side of the hut.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to hear of the accident,” he said. “You will find Captain\r\nHelding in that room.”\r\n\r\nFor the second time, with singular persistency, Wardour renewed the\r\nconversation with Frank.\r\n\r\n“So you knew the Burnhams?” he said. “What became of Clara when her\r\nfather died?”\r\n\r\nFrank’s face flushed angrily on the instant.\r\n\r\n“Clara!” he repeated. “What authorizes you to speak of Miss Burnham in\r\nthat familiar manner?”\r\n\r\nWardour seized the opportunity of quarreling with him.\r\n\r\n“What right have you to ask?” he retorted, coarsely.\r\n\r\nFrank’s blood was up. He forgot his promise to Clara to keep their\r\nengagement secret--he forgot everything but the unbridled insolence of\r\nWardour’s language and manner.\r\n\r\n“A right which I insist on your respecting,” he answered. “The right of\r\nbeing engaged to marry her.”\r\n\r\nCrayford’s steady eyes were still on the watch, and Wardour felt them\r\non him. A little more and Crayford might openly interfere. Even Wardour\r\nrecognized for once the necessity of controlling his temper, cost him\r\nwhat it might. He made his apologies, with overstrained politeness, to\r\nFrank.\r\n\r\n“Impossible to dispute such a right as yours,” he said. “Perhaps\r\nyou will excuse me when you know that I am one of Miss Burnham’s old\r\nfriends. My father and her father were neighbors. We have always met\r\nlike brother and sister--”\r\n\r\nFrank generously stopped the apology there.\r\n\r\n“Say no more,” he interposed. “I was in the wrong--I lost my temper.\r\nPray forgive me.”\r\n\r\nWardour looked at him with a strange, reluctant interest while he was\r\nspeaking. Wardour asked an extraordinary question when he had done.\r\n\r\n“Is she very fond of you?”\r\n\r\nFrank burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” he said, “come to our wedding, and judge for\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n“Come to your wedding?” As he repeated the words Wardour stole one\r\nglance at Frank which Frank (employed in buckling his knapsack) failed\r\nto see. Crayford noticed it, and Crayford’s blood ran cold. Comparing\r\nthe words which Wardour had spoken to him while they were alone together\r\nwith the words that had just passed in his presence, he could draw but\r\none conclusion. The woman whom Wardour had loved and lost was--Clara\r\nBurnham. The man who had robbed him of her was Frank Aldersley. And\r\nWardour had discovered it in the interval since they had last met.\r\n“Thank God!” thought Crayford, “the dice have parted them! Frank goes\r\nwith the expedition, and Wardour stays behind with me.”\r\n\r\nThe reflection had barely occurred to him--Frank’s thoughtless\r\ninvitation to Wardour had just passed his lips--when the canvas screen\r\nover the doorway was drawn aside. Captain Helding and the officers who\r\nwere to leave with the exploring party returned to the main room on\r\ntheir way out. Seeing Crayford, Captain Helding stopped to speak to him.\r\n\r\n“I have a casualty to report,” said the captain, “which diminishes\r\nour numbers by one. My second lieutenant, who was to have joined\r\nthe exploring party, has had a fall on the ice. Judging by what the\r\nquartermaster tells me, I am afraid the poor fellow has broken his leg.”\r\n\r\n“I will supply his place,” cried a voice at the other end of the hut.\r\n\r\nEverybody looked round. The man who had spoken was Richard Wardour.\r\n\r\nCrayford instantly interfered--so vehemently as to astonish all who knew\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“No!” he said. “Not you, Richard! not you!”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” Wardour asked, sternly.\r\n\r\n“Why not, indeed?” added Captain Helding. “Wardour is the very man to be\r\nuseful on a long march. He is in perfect health, and he is the best shot\r\namong us. I was on the point of proposing him myself.”\r\n\r\nCrayford failed to show his customary respect for his superior officer.\r\nHe openly disputed the captain’s conclusion.\r\n\r\n“Wardour has no right to volunteer,” he rejoined. “It has been settled,\r\nCaptain Helding, that chance shall decide who is to go and who is to\r\nstay.”\r\n\r\n“And chance _has_ decided it,” cried Wardour. “Do you think we are going\r\nto cast the dice again, and give an officer of the _Sea-mew_ a chance of\r\nreplacing an officer of the _Wanderer_? There is a vacancy in our party,\r\nnot in yours; and we claim the right of filling it as we please. I\r\nvolunteer, and my captain backs me. Whose authority is to keep me here\r\nafter that?”\r\n\r\n“Gently, Wardour,” said Captain Helding. “A man who is in the right can\r\nafford to speak with moderation.” He turned to Crayford. “You must admit\r\nyourself,” he continued, “that Wardour is right this time. The missing\r\nman belongs to my command, and in common justice one of my officers\r\nought to supply his place.”\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to dispute the matter further. The dullest man present\r\ncould see that the captain’s reply was unanswerable. In sheer despair,\r\nCrayford took Frank’s arm and led him aside a few steps. The last chance\r\nleft of parting the two men was the chance of appealing to Frank.\r\n\r\n“My dear boy,” he began, “I want to say one friendly word to you on the\r\nsubject of your health. I have already, if you remember, expressed my\r\ndoubts whether you are strong enough to make one of an exploring party.\r\nI feel those doubts more strongly than ever at this moment. Will you\r\ntake the advice of a friend who wishes you well?”\r\n\r\nWardour had followed Crayford. Wardour roughly interposed before Frank\r\ncould reply.\r\n\r\n“Let him alone!”\r\n\r\nCrayford paid no heed to the interruption. He was too earnestly bent on\r\nwithdrawing Frank from the expedition to notice anything that was said\r\nor done by the persons about him.\r\n\r\n“Don’t, pray don’t, risk hardships which you are unfit to bear!” he went\r\non, entreatingly. “Your place can be easily filled. Change your mind,\r\nFrank. Stay here with me.”\r\n\r\nAgain Wardour interfered. Again he called out, “Leave him alone!” more\r\nroughly than ever. Still deaf and blind to every consideration but one,\r\nCrayford pressed his entreaties on Frank.\r\n\r\n“You owned yourself just now that you were not well seasoned to\r\nfatigue,” he persisted. “You feel (you _must_ feel) how weak that last\r\nillness has left you? You know (I am sure you know) how unfit you are to\r\nbrave exposure to cold, and long marches over the snow.”\r\n\r\nIrritated beyond endurance by Crayford’s obstinacy; seeing, or thinking\r\nhe saw, signs of yielding in Frank’s face, Wardour so far forgot himself\r\nas to seize Crayford by the arm and attempt to drag him away from Frank.\r\nCrayford turned and looked at him.\r\n\r\n“Richard,” he said, very quietly, “you are not yourself. I pity you.\r\nDrop your hand.”\r\n\r\nWardour relaxed his hold, with something of the sullen submission of\r\na wild animal to its keeper. The momentary silence which followed gave\r\nFrank an opportunity of speaking at last.\r\n\r\n“I am gratefully sensible, Crayford,” he began, “of the interest which\r\nyou take in me--”\r\n\r\n“And you will follow my advice?” Crayford interposed, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“My mind is made up, old friend,” Frank answered, firmly and sadly.\r\n“Forgive me for disappointing you. I am appointed to the expedition.\r\nWith the expedition I go.” He moved nearer to Wardour. In his innocence\r\nof all suspicion he clapped Wardour heartily on the shoulder. “When\r\nI feel the fatigue,” said poor simple Frank, “you will help me,\r\ncomrade--won’t you? Come along!”\r\n\r\nWardour snatched his gun out of the hands of the sailor who was carrying\r\nit for him. His dark face became suddenly irradiated with a terrible\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n“Come!” he cried. “Over the snow and over the ice! Come! where no human\r\nfootsteps have ever trodden, and where no human trace is ever left.”\r\n\r\nBlindly, instinctively, Crayford made an effort to part them. His\r\nbrother officers, standing near, pulled him back. They looked at each\r\nother anxiously. The merciless cold, striking its victims in various\r\nways, had struck in some instances at their reason first. Everybody\r\nloved Crayford. Was he, too, going on the dark way that others had\r\ntaken before him? They forced him to seat himself on one of the lockers.\r\n“Steady, old fellow!” they said kindly--“steady!” Crayford yielded,\r\nwrithing inwardly under the sense of his own helplessness. What in God’s\r\nname could he do? Could he denounce Wardour to Captain Helding on bare\r\nsuspicion--without so much as the shadow of a proof to justify what he\r\nsaid? The captain would decline to insult one of his officers by even\r\nmentioning the monstrous accusation to him. The captain would conclude,\r\nas others had already concluded, that Crayford’s mind was giving way\r\nunder stress of cold and privation. No hope--literally, no hope now,\r\nbut in the numbers of the expedition. Officers and men, they all liked\r\nFrank. As long as they could stir hand or foot, they would help him on\r\nthe way--they would see that no harm came to him.\r\n\r\nThe word of command was given; the door was thrown open; the hut emptied\r\nrapidly. Over the merciless white snow--under the merciless black\r\nsky--the exploring party began to move. The sick and helpless men,\r\nwhose last hope of rescue centered in their departing messmates, cheered\r\nfaintly. Some few whose days were numbered sobbed and cried like women.\r\nFrank’s voice faltered as he turned back at the door to say his last\r\nwords to the friend who had been a father to him.\r\n\r\n“God bless you, Crayford!”\r\n\r\nCrayford broke away from the officers near him; and, hurrying forward,\r\nseized Frank by both hands. Crayford held him as if he would never let\r\nhim go.\r\n\r\n“God preserve you, Frank! I would give all I have in the world to be\r\nwith you. Good-by! Good-by!”\r\n\r\nFrank waved his hand--dashed away the tears that were gathering in his\r\neyes--and hurried out. Crayford called after him, the last, the only\r\nwarning that he could give:\r\n\r\n“While you can stand, keep with the main body, Frank!”\r\n\r\nWardour, waiting till the last--Wardour, following Frank through the\r\nsnow-drift--stopped, stepped back, and answered Crayford at the door:\r\n\r\n“While he can stand, he keeps with Me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThird Scene--The Iceberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlone! alone on the Frozen Deep!\r\n\r\nThe Arctic sun is rising dimly in the dreary sky. The beams of the cold\r\nnorthern moon, mingling strangely with the dawning light, clothe the\r\nsnowy plains in hues of livid gray. An ice-field on the far horizon is\r\nmoving slowly southward in the spectral light. Nearer, a stream of\r\nopen water rolls its slow black waves past the edges of the ice. Nearer\r\nstill, following the drift, an iceberg rears its crags and pinnacles\r\nto the sky; here, glittering in the moonbeams; there, looming dim and\r\nghost-like in the ashy light.\r\n\r\nMidway on the long sweep of the lower slope of the iceberg, what objects\r\nrise, and break the desolate monotony of the scene? In this awful\r\nsolitude, can signs appear which tell of human Life? Yes! The black\r\noutline of a boat just shows itself, hauled up on the berg. In an\r\nice-cavern behind the boat the last red embers of a dying fire flicker\r\nfrom time to time over the figures of two men. One is seated, resting\r\nhis back against the side of the cavern. The other lies prostrate, with\r\nhis head on his comrade’s knee. The first of these men is awake, and\r\nthinking. The second reclines, with his still white face turned up to\r\nthe sky--sleeping or dead. Days and days since, these two have fallen\r\nbehind on the march of the expedition of relief. Days and days since,\r\nthese two have been given up by their weary and failing companions as\r\ndoomed and lost. He who sits thinking is Richard Wardour. He who lies\r\nsleeping or dead is Frank Aldersley.\r\n\r\nThe iceberg drifts slowly, over the black water, through the ashy light.\r\nMinute by minute the dying fire sinks. Minute by minute the deathly cold\r\ncreeps nearer and nearer to the lost men.\r\n\r\nRichard Wardour rouses himself from his thoughts--looks at the still\r\nwhite face beneath him--and places his hand on Frank’s heart. It still\r\nbeats feebly. Give him his share of the food and fuel still stored in\r\nthe boat, and Frank may live through it. Leave him neglected where he\r\nlies, and his death is a question of hours--perhaps minutes; who knows?\r\n\r\nRichard Wardour lifts the sleeper’s head and rests it against the cavern\r\nside. He goes to the boat, and returns with a billet of wood. He\r\nstoops to place the wood on the fire--and stops. Frank is dreaming,\r\nand murmuring in his dream. A woman’s name passes his lips. Frank is in\r\nEngland again--at the ball--whispering to Clara the confession of his\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nOver Richard Wardour’s face there passes the shadow of a deadly thought.\r\nHe rises from the fire; he takes the wood back to the boat. His iron\r\nstrength is shaken, but it still holds out. They are drifting nearer and\r\nnearer to the open sea. He can launch the boat without help; he can take\r\nthe food and the fuel with him. The sleeper on the iceberg is the man\r\nwho has robbed him of Clara--who has wrecked the hope and the happiness\r\nof his life. Leave the man in his sleep, and let him die!\r\n\r\nSo the tempter whispers. Richard Wardour tries his strength on the boat.\r\nIt moves: he has got it under control. He stops, and looks round. Beyond\r\nhim is the open sea. Beneath him is the man who has robbed him of Clara.\r\nThe shadow of the deadly thought grows and darkens over his face. He\r\nwaits with his hands on the boat--waits and thinks.\r\n\r\nThe iceberg drifts slowly--over the black water; through the ashy light.\r\nMinute by minute, the dying fire sinks. Minute by minute, the deathly\r\ncold creeps nearer to the sleeping man. And still Richard Wardour\r\nwaits--waits and thinks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFourth Scene--The Garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spring has come. The air of the April night just lifts the leaves\r\nof the sleeping flowers. The moon is queen in the cloudless and starless\r\nsky. The stillness of the midnight hour is abroad, over land and over\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nIn a villa on the westward shore of the Isle of Wight, the glass doors\r\nwhich lead from the drawing-room to the garden are yet open. The shaded\r\nlamp yet burns on the table. A lady sits by the lamp, reading. From time\r\nto time she looks out into the garden, and sees the white-robed figure\r\nof a young girl pacing slowly to and fro in the soft brightness of the\r\nmoonlight on the lawn. Sorrow and suspense have set their mark on the\r\nlady. Not rivals only, but friends who formerly admired her, agree\r\nnow that she looks worn and aged. The more merciful judgment of others\r\nremarks, with equal truth, that her eyes, her hair, her simple grace\r\nand grandeur of movement have lost but little of their olden charms. The\r\ntruth lies, as usual, between the two extremes. In spite of sorrow and\r\nsuffering, Mrs. Crayford is the beautiful Mrs. Crayford still.\r\n\r\nThe delicious silence of the hour is softly disturbed by the voice of\r\nthe younger lady in the garden.\r\n\r\n“Go to the piano, Lucy. It is a night for music. Play something that is\r\nworthy of the night.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford looks round at the clock on the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n“My dear Clara, it is past twelve! Remember what the doctor told you.\r\nYou ought to have been in bed an hour ago.”\r\n\r\n“Half an hour, Lucy--give me half an hour more! Look at the moonlight\r\non the sea. Is it possible to go to bed on such a night as this? Play\r\nsomething, Lucy--something spiritual and divine.”\r\n\r\nEarnestly pleading with her friend, Clara advances toward the window.\r\nShe too has suffered under the wasting influences of suspense. Her face\r\nhas lost its youthful freshness; no delicate flush of color rises on\r\nit when she speaks. The soft gray eyes which won Frank’s heart in the\r\nby-gone time are sadly altered now. In repose, they have a dimmed and\r\nwearied look. In action, they are wild and restless, like eyes suddenly\r\nwakened from startling dreams. Robed in white--her soft brown hair\r\nhanging loosely over her shoulders--there is something weird and\r\nghost-like in the girl, as she moves nearer and nearer to the window in\r\nthe full light of the moon--pleading for music that shall be worthy of\r\nthe mystery and the beauty of the night.\r\n\r\n“Will you come in here if I play to you?” Mrs. Crayford asks. “It is a\r\nrisk, my love, to be out so long in the night air.”\r\n\r\n“No! no! I like it. Play--while I am out here looking at the sea. It\r\nquiets me; it comforts me; it does me good.”\r\n\r\nShe glides back, ghost-like, over the lawn. Mrs. Crayford rises, and\r\nputs down the volume that she has been reading. It is a record of\r\nexplorations in the Arctic seas. The time has gone by when the two\r\nlonely women could take an interest in subjects not connected with their\r\nown anxieties. Now, when hope is fast failing them--now, when their last\r\nnews of the _Wanderer_ and the _Sea-mew_ is news that is more than two\r\nyears old--they can read of nothing, they can think of nothing, but\r\ndangers and discoveries, losses and rescues in the terrible Polar seas.\r\n\r\nUnwillingly, Mrs. Crayford puts her book aside, and opens the\r\npiano--Mozart’s “Air in A, with Variations,” lies open on the\r\ninstrument. One after another she plays the lovely melodies, so simply,\r\nso purely beautiful, of that unpretending and unrivaled work. At the\r\nclose of the ninth Variation (Clara’s favorite), she pauses, and turns\r\ntoward the garden.\r\n\r\n“Shall I stop there?” she asks.\r\n\r\nThere is no answer. Has Clara wandered away out of hearing of the music\r\nthat she loves--the music that harmonizes so subtly with the tender\r\nbeauty of the night? Mrs. Crayford rises and advances to the window.\r\n\r\nNo! there is the white figure standing alone on the slope of the\r\nlawn--the head turned away from the house; the face looking out over\r\nthe calm sea, whose gently rippling waters end in the dim line on the\r\nhorizon which is the line of the Hampshire coast.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford advances as far as the path before the window, and calls\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n“Clara!”\r\n\r\nAgain there is no answer. The white figure still stands immovably in its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWith signs of distress in her face, but with no appearance of alarm,\r\nMrs. Crayford returns to the room. Her own sad experience tells her what\r\nhas happened. She summons the servants and directs them to wait in the\r\ndrawing-room until she calls to them. This done, she returns to the\r\ngarden, and approaches the mysterious figure on the lawn.\r\n\r\nDead to the outer world, as if she lay already in her grave--insensible\r\nto touch, insensible to sound, motionless as stone, cold as stone--Clara\r\nstands on the moonlit lawn, facing the seaward view. Mrs. Crayford waits\r\nat her side, patiently watching for the change which she knows is to\r\ncome. “Catalepsy,” as some call it--“hysteria,” as others say--this\r\nalone is certain, the same interval always passes; the same change\r\nalways appears.\r\n\r\nIt comes now. Not a change in her eyes; they still remain wide open,\r\nfixed and glassy. The first movement is a movement of her hands. They\r\nrise slowly from her side and waver in the air like the hands of a\r\nperson groping in the dark. Another interval, and the movement spreads\r\nto her lips: they part and tremble. A few minutes more, and words begin\r\nto drop, one by one, from those parted lips--words spoken in a lost,\r\nvacant tone, as if she is talking in her sleep.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford looks back at the house. Sad experience makes her\r\nsuspicious of the servants’ curiosity. Sad experience has long since\r\nwarned her that the servants are not to be trusted within hearing of\r\nthe wild words which Clara speaks in the trance. Has any one of them\r\nventured into the garden? No. They are out of hearing at the window,\r\nwaiting for the signal which tells them that their help is needed.\r\n\r\nTurning toward Clara once more, Mrs. Crayford hears the vacantly uttered\r\nwords, falling faster and faster from her lips,\r\n\r\n“Frank! Frank! Frank! Don’t drop behind--don’t trust Richard Wardour.\r\nWhile you can stand, keep with the other men, Frank!”\r\n\r\n(The farewell warning of Crayford in the solitudes of the Frozen Deep,\r\nrepeated by Clara in the garden of her English home!)\r\n\r\nA moment of silence follows; and, in that moment, the vision has\r\nchanged. She sees him on the iceberg now, at the mercy of the bitterest\r\nenemy he has on earth. She sees him drifting--over the black water,\r\nthrough the ashy light.\r\n\r\n“Wake, Frank! wake and defend yourself! Richard Wardour knows that\r\nI love you--Richard Wardour’s vengeance will take your life! Wake,\r\nFrank--wake! You are drifting to your death!” A low groan of horror\r\nbursts from her, sinister and terrible to hear. “Drifting! drifting!”\r\n she whispers to herself--“drifting to his death!”\r\n\r\nHer glassy eyes suddenly soften--then close. A long shudder runs through\r\nher. A faint flush shows itself on the deadly pallor of her face, and\r\nfades again. Her limbs fail her. She sinks into Mrs. Crayford’s arms.\r\n\r\nThe servants, answering the call for help, carry her into the house.\r\nThey lay her insensible on her bed. After half an hour or more, her eyes\r\nopen again--this time with the light of life in them--open, and rest\r\nlanguidly on the friend sitting by the bedside.\r\n\r\n“I have had a dreadful dream,” she murmurs faintly. “Am I ill, Lucy? I\r\nfeel so weak.”\r\n\r\nEven as she says the words, sleep, gentle, natural sleep, takes her\r\nsuddenly, as it takes young children weary with their play. Though it\r\nis all over now, though no further watching is required, Mrs. Crayford\r\nstill keeps her place by the bedside, too anxious and too wakeful to\r\nretire to her own room.\r\n\r\nOn other occasions, she is accustomed to dismiss from her mind the words\r\nwhich drop from Clara in the trance. This time the effort to dismiss\r\nthem is beyond her power. The words haunt her. Vainly she recalls to\r\nmemory all that the doctors have said to her, in speaking of Clara in\r\nthe state of trance. “What she vaguely dreads for the lost man whom she\r\nloves is mingled in her mind with what she is constantly reading, of\r\ntrials, dangers, and escapes in the Arctic seas. The most startling\r\nthings that she may say or do are all attributable to this cause, and\r\nmay all be explained in this way.” So the doctors have spoken; and, thus\r\nfar, Mrs. Crayford has shared their view. It is only to-night that the\r\ngirl’s words ring in her ear, with a strange prophetic sound in them.\r\nIt is only to-night that she asks herself: “Is Clara present, in the\r\nspirit, with our loved and lost ones in the lonely North? Can mortal\r\nvision see the dead and living in the solitudes of the Frozen Deep?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night had passed.\r\n\r\nFar and near the garden view looked its gayest and brightest in the\r\nlight of the noonday sun. The cheering sounds which tell of life and\r\naction were audible all round the villa. From the garden of the nearest\r\nhouse rose the voices of children at play. Along the road at the back\r\nsounded the roll of wheels, as carts and carriages passed at intervals.\r\nOut on the blue sea, the distant splash of the paddles, the distant\r\nthump of the engines, told from time to time of the passage of steamers,\r\nentering or leaving the strait between the island and the mainland. In\r\nthe trees, the birds sang gayly among the rustling leaves. In the house,\r\nthe women-servants were laughing over some jest or story that cheered\r\nthem at their work. It was a lively and pleasant time--a bright,\r\nenjoyable day.\r\n\r\nThe two ladies were out together; resting on a garden seat, after a walk\r\nround the grounds.\r\n\r\nThey exchanged a few trivial words relating to the beauty of the day,\r\nand then said no more. Possessing the same consciousness of what she had\r\nseen in the trance which persons in general possess of what they\r\nhave seen in a dream--believing in the vision as a supernatural\r\nrevelation--Clara’s worst forebodings were now, to her mind, realized\r\nas truths. Her last faint hope of ever seeing Frank again was now at an\r\nend. Intimate experience of her told Mrs. Crayford what was passing in\r\nClara’s mind, and warned her that the attempt to reason and remonstrate\r\nwould be little better than a voluntary waste of words and time. The\r\ndisposition which she had herself felt on the previous night, to attach\r\na superstitious importance to the words that Clara had spoken in the\r\ntrance, had vanished with the return of the morning. Rest and reflection\r\nhad quieted her mind, and had restored the composing influence of\r\nher sober sense. Sympathizing with Clara in all besides, she had no\r\nsympathy, as they sat together in the pleasant sunshine, with Clara’s\r\ngloomy despair of the future. She, who could still hope, had nothing to\r\nsay to the sad companion who had done with hope. So the quiet minutes\r\nsucceeded each other, and the two friends sat side by side in silence.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed, and the gate-bell of the villa rang.\r\n\r\nThey both started--they both knew the ring. It was the hour when\r\nthe postman brought their newspapers from London. In past days, what\r\nhundreds on hundreds of times they had torn off the cover which inclosed\r\nthe newspaper, and looked at the same column with the same weary\r\nmingling of hope and despair! There to-day--as it was yesterday; as it\r\nwould be, if they lived, to-morrow--there was the servant with Lucy’s\r\nnewspaper and Clara’s newspaper in his hand!\r\n\r\nWould both of them do again to-day what both had done so often in the\r\ndays that were gone?\r\n\r\nNo! Mrs. Crayford removed the cover from her newspaper as usual. Clara\r\nlaid _her_ newspaper aside, unopened, on the garden seat.\r\n\r\nIn silence, Mrs. Crayford looked, where she always looked, at the column\r\ndevoted to the Latest Intelligence from foreign parts. The instant her\r\neye fell on the page she started with a loud cry of joy. The newspaper\r\nfell from her trembling hand. She caught Clara in her arms. “Oh, my\r\ndarling! my darling! news of them at last.”\r\n\r\nWithout answering, without the slightest change in look or manner, Clara\r\ntook the newspaper from the ground, and read the top line in the column,\r\nprinted in capital letters:\r\n\r\nTHE ARCTIC EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\nShe waited, and looked at Mrs. Crayford.\r\n\r\n“Can you bear to hear it, Lucy,” she asked, “if I read it aloud?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford was too agitated to answer in words. She signed\r\nimpatiently to Clara to go on.\r\n\r\nClara read the news which followed the heading in capital letters. Thus\r\nit ran:\r\n\r\n“The following intelligence, from St. Johns, Newfoundland, has reached\r\nus for publication. The whaling-vessel _Blythewood_ is reported to\r\nhave met with the surviving officers and men of the Expedition in Davis\r\nStrait. Many are stated to be dead, and some are supposed to be missing.\r\nThe list of the saved, as collected by the people of the whaler, is not\r\nvouched for as being absolutely correct, the circumstances having been\r\nadverse to investigation. The vessel was pressed for time; and the\r\nmembers of the Expedition, all more or less suffering from exhaustion,\r\nwere not in a position to give the necessary assistance to inquiry.\r\nFurther particulars may be looked for by the next mail.”\r\n\r\nThe list of the survivors followed, beginning with the officers in the\r\norder of their rank. They both read the list together. The first name\r\nwas Captain Helding; the second was Lieutenant Crayford.\r\n\r\nThere the wife’s joy overpowered her. After a pause, she put her arm\r\naround Clara’s waist, and spoke to her.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my love!” she murmured, “are you as happy as I am? Is Frank’s\r\nname there too? The tears are in my eyes. Read for me--I can’t read for\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\nThe answer came, in still, sad tones:\r\n\r\n“I have read as far as your husband’s name. I have no need to read\r\nfurther.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford dashed the tears from her eyes--steadied herself--and\r\nlooked at the newspaper.\r\n\r\nOn the list of the survivors, the search was vain. Frank’s name was not\r\namong them. On a second list, headed “Dead or Missing,” the first two\r\nnames that appeared were:\r\n\r\nFRANCIS ALDERSLEY. RICHARD WARDOUR.\r\n\r\nIn speechless distress and dismay, Mrs. Crayford looked at Clara. Had\r\nshe force enough in her feeble health to sustain the shock that\r\nhad fallen on her? Yes! she bore it with a strange unnatural\r\nresignation--she looked, she spoke, with the sad self-possession of\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n“I was prepared for it,” she said. “I saw them in the spirit last night.\r\nRichard Wardour has discovered the truth; and Frank has paid the penalty\r\nwith his life--and I, I alone, am to blame.” She shuddered, and put her\r\nhand on her heart. “We shall not be long parted, Lucy. I shall go to\r\nhim. He will not return to me.”\r\n\r\nThose words were spoken with a calm certainty of conviction that was\r\nterrible to hear. “I have no more to say,” she added, after a moment,\r\nand rose to return to the house. Mrs. Crayford caught her by the hand,\r\nand forced her to take her seat again.\r\n\r\n“Don’t look at me, don’t speak to me, in that horrible manner!” she\r\nexclaimed. “Clara! it is unworthy of a reasonable being, it is doubting\r\nthe mercy of God, to say what you have just said. Look at the newspaper\r\nagain. See! They tell you plainly that their information is not to be\r\ndepended on--they warn you to wait for further particulars. The very\r\nwords at the top of the list show how little they knew of the truth\r\n‘Dead _or_ Missing!’ On their own showing, it is quite as likely that\r\nFrank is missing as that Frank is dead. For all you know, the next mail\r\nmay bring a letter from him. Are you listening to me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Can you deny what I say?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“‘Yes!’ ‘No!’ Is that the way to answer me when I am so distressed and\r\nso anxious about you?”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry I spoke as I did, Lucy. We look at some subjects in very\r\ndifferent ways. I don’t dispute, dear, that yours is the reasonable\r\nview.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t dispute?” retorted Mrs. Crayford, warmly. “No! you do what\r\nis worse--you believe in your own opinion; you persist in your own\r\nconclusion--with the newspaper before you! Do you, or do you not,\r\nbelieve the newspaper?”\r\n\r\n“I believe in what I saw last night.”\r\n\r\n“In what you saw last night! You, an educated woman, a clever woman,\r\nbelieving in a vision of your own fancy--a mere dream! I wonder you are\r\nnot ashamed to acknowledge it!”\r\n\r\n“Call it a dream if you like, Lucy. I have had other dreams at other\r\ntimes--and I have known them to be fulfilled.”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” said Mrs. Crayford. “For once in a way they may have been\r\nfulfilled, by chance--and you notice it, and remember it, and pin your\r\nfaith on it. Come, Clara, be honest!--What about the occasions when the\r\nchance has been against you, and your dreams have not been fulfilled?\r\nYou superstitious people are all alike. You conveniently forget when\r\nyour dreams and your presentiments prove false. For my sake, dear, if\r\nnot for your own,” she continued, in gentler and tenderer tones, “try\r\nto be more reasonable and more hopeful. Don’t lose your trust in the\r\nfuture, and your trust in God. God, who has saved my husband, can save\r\nFrank. While there is doubt, there is hope. Don’t embitter my happiness,\r\nClara! Try to think as I think--if it is only to show that you love me.”\r\n\r\nShe put her arm round the girl’s neck, and kissed her. Clara returned\r\nthe kiss; Clara answered, sadly and submissively,\r\n\r\n“I do love you, Lucy. I _will_ try.”\r\n\r\nHaving answered in those terms, she sighed to herself, and said no more.\r\nIt would have been plain, only too plain, to far less observant eyes\r\nthan Mrs. Crayford’s that no salutary impression had been produced on\r\nher. She had ceased to defend her own way of thinking, she spoke of\r\nit no more--but there was the terrible conviction of Frank’s death at\r\nWardour’s hands rooted as firmly as ever in her mind! Discouraged and\r\ndistressed, Mrs. Crayford left her, and walked back toward the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the drawing-room window of the villa there appeared a polite little\r\nman, with bright intelligent eyes, and cheerful sociable manners. Neatly\r\ndressed in professional black, he stood, self-proclaimed, a prosperous\r\ncountry doctor--successful and popular in a wide circle of patients and\r\nfriends. As Mrs. Crayford approached him, he stepped out briskly to\r\nmeet her on the lawn, with both hands extended in courteous and cordial\r\ngreeting.\r\n\r\n“My dear madam, accept my heartfelt congratulations!” cried the doctor.\r\n“I have seen the good news in the paper; and I could hardly feel more\r\nrejoiced than I do now if I had the honor of knowing Lieutenant Crayford\r\npersonally. We mean to celebrate the occasion at home. I said to my\r\nwife before I came out, ‘A bottle of the old Madeira at dinner to-day,\r\nmind!--to drink the lieutenant’s health; God bless him!’ And how is our\r\ninteresting patient? The news is not altogether what we could wish, so\r\nfar as she is concerned. I felt a little anxious, to tell you the truth,\r\nabout the effect of it; and I have paid my visit to-day before my usual\r\ntime. Not that I take a gloomy view of the news myself. No! There is\r\nclearly a doubt about the correctness of the information, so far as\r\nMr. Aldersley is concerned--and that is a point, a great point in Mr.\r\nAldersley’s favor. I give him the benefit of the doubt, as the lawyers\r\nsay. Does Miss Burnham give him the benefit of the doubt too? I hardly\r\ndare hope it, I confess.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Burnham has grieved and alarmed me,” Mrs. Crayford answered. “I\r\nwas just thinking of sending for you when we met here.”\r\n\r\nWith those introductory words, she told the doctor exactly what had\r\nhappened; repeating not only the conversation of that morning between\r\nClara and herself, but also the words which had fallen from Clara, in\r\nthe trance of the past night.\r\n\r\nThe doctor listened attentively. Little by little, its easy smiling\r\ncomposure vanished from his face, as Mrs. Crayford went on, and left him\r\ncompletely transformed into a grave and thoughtful man.\r\n\r\n“Let us go and look at her,” he said.\r\n\r\nHe seated himself by Clara’s side, and carefully studied her face, with\r\nhis hand on her pulse. There was no sympathy here between the dreamy\r\nmystical temperament of the patient and the downright practical\r\ncharacter of the doctor. Clara secretly disliked her medical attendant.\r\nShe submitted impatiently to the close investigation of which he made\r\nher the object. He questioned her--and she answered irritably. Advancing\r\na step further (the doctor was not easily discouraged) he adverted to\r\nthe news of the Expedition, and took up the tone of remonstrance which\r\nhad been already adopted by Mrs. Crayford. Clara declined to discuss the\r\nquestion. She rose with formal politeness, and requested permission to\r\nreturn to the house. The doctor attempted no further resistance. “By all\r\nmeans, Miss Burnham,” he answered, resignedly--having first cast a look\r\nat Mrs. Crayford which said plainly, “Stay here with me.” Clara bowed\r\nher acknowledgments in cold silence, and left them together. The\r\ndoctor’s bright eyes followed the girl’s wasted, yet still graceful\r\nfigure as it slowly receded from view, with an expression of grave\r\nanxiety which Mrs. Crayford noticed with grave misgiving on her side.\r\nHe said nothing, until Clara had disappeared under the veranda which ran\r\nround the garden-side of the house.\r\n\r\n“I think you told me,” he began, “that Miss Burnham has neither father\r\nnor mother living?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Miss Burnham is an orphan.”\r\n\r\n“Has she any near relatives?”\r\n\r\n“No. You may speak to me as her guardian and her friend. Are you alarmed\r\nabout her?”\r\n\r\n“I am seriously alarmed. It is only two days since I called here last,\r\nand I see a marked change in her for the worse--physically and morally,\r\na change for the worse. Don’t needlessly alarm yourself! The case is\r\nnot, I trust, entirely beyond the reach of remedy. The great hope for\r\nus is the hope that Mr. Aldersley may still be living. In that event,\r\nI should feel no misgivings about the future. Her marriage would make a\r\nhealthy and a happy woman of her. But as things are, I own I dread that\r\nsettled conviction in her mind that Mr. Aldersley is dead, and that her\r\nown death is soon to follow. In her present state of health this\r\nidea (haunting her as it certainly will night and day) will have its\r\ninfluence on her body as well as on her mind. Unless we can check the\r\nmischief, her last reserves of strength will give way. If you wish for\r\nother advice, by all means send for it. You have my opinion.”\r\n\r\n“I am quite satisfied with your opinion,” Mrs. Crayford replied. “For\r\nGod’s sake, tell me, what can we do?”\r\n\r\n“We can try a complete change,” said the doctor. “We can remove her at\r\nonce from this place.”\r\n\r\n“She will refuse to leave it,” Mrs. Crayford rejoined. “I have more than\r\nonce proposed a change to her--and she always says No.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor paused for a moment, like a man collecting his thoughts.\r\n\r\n“I heard something on my way here,” he proceeded, “which suggests to my\r\nmind a method of meeting the difficulty that you have just mentioned.\r\nUnless I am entirely mistaken, Miss Burnham will not say No to the\r\nchange that I have in view for her.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Mrs. Crayford, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me if I ask you a question, on my part, before I reply,” said\r\nthe doctor. “Are you fortunate enough to possess any interest at the\r\nAdmiralty?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. My father is in the Secretary’s office; and two of the Lords\r\nof the Admiralty are friends of his.”\r\n\r\n“Excellent! Now I can speak out plainly with little fear of\r\ndisappointing you. After what I have said, you will agree with me, that\r\nthe only change in Miss Burnham’s life which will be of any use to her\r\nis a change that will alter the present tone of her mind on the subject\r\nof Mr. Aldersley. Place her in a position to discover--not by reference\r\nto her own distempered fancies and visions, but by reference to actual\r\nevidence and actual fact--whether Mr. Aldersley is, or is not, a living\r\nman; and there will be an end of the hysterical delusions which now\r\nthreaten to fatally undermine her health. Even taking matters at their\r\nworst--even assuming that Mr. Aldersley has died in the Arctic seas--it\r\nwill be less injurious to her to discover this positively, than to leave\r\nher mind to feed on its own morbid superstitions and speculations, for\r\nweeks and weeks together, while the next news from the Expedition is on\r\nits way to England. In one word, I want you to be in a position, before\r\nthe week is out, to put Miss Burnham’s present conviction to a practical\r\ntest. Suppose you could say to her, ‘We differ, my dear, about Mr.\r\nFrancis Aldersley. You declare, without the shadow of a reason for it,\r\nthat he is certainly dead, and, worse still, that he has died by the\r\nact of one of his brother officers. I assert, on the authority of the\r\nnewspaper, that nothing of the sort has happened, and that the chances\r\nare all in favor of his being still a living man. What do you say to\r\ncrossing the Atlantic, and deciding which of us is right--you or I?’\r\nDo you think Miss Burnham will say No to that, Mrs. Crayford? If I know\r\nanything of human nature, she will seize the opportunity as a means of\r\nconverting you to a belief in the Second Sight.”\r\n\r\n“Good Heavens, doctor! do you mean to tell me that we are to go to sea\r\nand meet the Arctic Expedition on its way home?”\r\n\r\n“Admirably guessed, Mrs. Crayford! That is exactly what I mean.”\r\n\r\n“But how is it to be done?”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you immediately. I mentioned--didn’t I?--that I had heard\r\nsomething on my road to this house.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I met an old friend at my own gate, who walked with me a part of\r\nthe way here. Last night my friend dined with the admiral at Portsmouth.\r\nAmong the guests there was a member of the Ministry who had brought the\r\nnews about the Expedition with him from London. This gentleman told the\r\ncompany there was very little doubt that the Admiralty would immediately\r\nsend out a steam-vessel, to meet the rescued men on the shores of\r\nAmerica, and bring them home. Wait a little, Mrs. Crayford! Nobody\r\nknows, as yet, under what rules and regulations the vessel will sail.\r\nUnder somewhat similar circumstances, privileged people have been\r\nreceived as passengers, or rather as guests, in her majesty’s ships--and\r\nwhat has been conceded on former occasions may, by bare possibility, be\r\nconceded now. I can say no more. If you are not afraid of the voyage for\r\nyourself, I am not afraid of it (nay, I am all in favor of it on medical\r\ngrounds) for my patient. What do you say? Will you write to your father,\r\nand ask him to try what his interest will do with his friends at the\r\nAdmiralty?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford rose excitedly to her feet.\r\n\r\n“Write!” she exclaimed. “I will do better than write. The journey to\r\nLondon is no great matter--and my housekeeper here is to be trusted\r\nto take care of Clara in my absence. I will see my father to-night! He\r\nshall make good use of his interest at the Admiralty--you may rely on\r\nthat. Oh, my dear doctor, what a prospect it is! My husband! Clara!\r\nWhat a discovery you have made--what a treasure you are! How can I thank\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Compose yourself, my dear madam. Don’t make too sure of success. We\r\nmay consider Miss Burnham’s objections as disposed of beforehand. But\r\nsuppose the Lords of the Admiralty say No?”\r\n\r\n“In that case, I shall be in London, doctor; and I shall go to them\r\nmyself. Lords are only men; and men are not in the habit of saying No to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nSo they parted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a week from that day, her majesty’s ship _Amazon_ sailed for North\r\nAmerica. Certain privileged persons, specially interested in the Arctic\r\nvoyagers, were permitted to occupy the empty state-rooms on board.\r\nOn the list of these favored guests of the ship were the names of two\r\nladies--Mrs. Crayford and Miss Burnham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFifth Scene--The Boat-House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce more the open sea--the sea whose waters break on the shores of\r\nNewfoundland! An English steamship lies at anchor in the offing. The\r\nvessel is plainly visible through the open doorway of a large boat-house\r\non the shore--one of the buildings attached to a fishing-station on the\r\ncoast of the island.\r\n\r\nThe only person in the boat-house at this moment is a man in the dress\r\nof a sailor. He is seated on a chest, with a piece of cord in his hand,\r\nlooking out idly at the sea. On the rough carpenter’s table near him\r\nlies a strange object to be left in such a place--a woman’s veil.\r\n\r\nWhat is the vessel lying at anchor in the offing?\r\n\r\nThe vessel is the _Amazon_--dispatched from England to receive the\r\nsurviving officers and men of the Arctic Expedition. The meeting has\r\nbeen successfully effected, on the shores of North America, three days\r\nsince. But the homeward voyage has been delayed by a storm which has\r\ndriven the ship out of her course. Taking advantage, on the third day,\r\nof the first returning calm, the commander of the _Amazon_ has anchored\r\noff the coast of Newfoundland, and has sent ashore to increase his\r\nsupplies of water before he sails for England. The weary passengers have\r\nlanded for a few hours, to refresh themselves after the discomforts of\r\nthe tempest. Among them are the two ladies. The veil left on the table\r\nin the boat-house is Clara’s veil.\r\n\r\nAnd who is the man sitting on the chest, with the cord in his hand,\r\nlooking out idly at the sea? The man is the only cheerful person in the\r\nship’s company. In other words--John Want.\r\n\r\nStill reposing on the chest, our friend, who never grumbles, is\r\nsurprised by the sudden appearance of a sailor at the boat-house door.\r\n\r\n“Look sharp with your work there, John Want!” says the sailor.\r\n“Lieutenant Crayford is just coming in to look after you.”\r\n\r\nWith this warning the messenger disappears again. John Want rises with\r\na groan, turns the chest up on one end, and begins to fasten the cord\r\nround it. The ship’s cook is not a man to look back on his rescue with\r\nthe feeling of unmitigated satisfaction which animates his companions\r\nin trouble. On the contrary, he is ungratefully disposed to regret the\r\nNorth Pole.\r\n\r\n“If I had only known”--thus runs the train of thought in the mind of\r\nJohn Want--“if I had only known, before I was rescued, that I was to be\r\nbrought to this place, I believe I should have preferred staying at the\r\nNorth Pole. I was very happy keeping up everybody’s spirits at the\r\nNorth Pole. Taking one thing with another, I think I must have been very\r\ncomfortable at the North Pole--if I had only known it. Another man in\r\nmy place might be inclined to say that this Newfoundland boat-house was\r\nrather a sloppy, slimy, draughty, fishy sort of a habitation to take\r\nshelter in. Another man might object to perpetual Newfoundland fogs,\r\nperpetual Newfoundland cod-fish, and perpetual Newfoundland dogs. We\r\nhad some very nice bears at the North Pole. Never mind! it’s all one to\r\nme--_I_ don’t grumble.”\r\n\r\n“Have you done cording that box?”\r\n\r\nThis time the voice is a voice of authority--the man at the doorway is\r\nLieutenant Crayford himself. John Want answers his officer in his own\r\ncheerful way.\r\n\r\n“I’ve done it as well as I can, sir--but the damp of this place is\r\nbeginning to tell upon our very ropes. I say nothing about our lungs--I\r\nonly say our ropes.”\r\n\r\nCrayford answers sharply. He seems to have lost his former relish for\r\nthe humor of John Want.\r\n\r\n“Pooh! To look at your wry face, one would think that our rescue from\r\nthe Arctic regions was a downright misfortune. You deserve to be sent\r\nback again.”\r\n\r\n“I could be just as cheerful as ever, sir, if I _was_ sent back again;\r\nI hope I’m thankful; but I don’t like to hear the North Pole run down\r\nin such a fishy place as this. It was very clean and snowy at the\r\nNorth Pole--and it’s very damp and sandy here. Do you never miss your\r\nbone-soup, sir? _I_ do. It mightn’t have been strong; but it was very\r\nhot; and the cold seemed to give it a kind of a meaty flavor as it went\r\ndown. Was it you that was a-coughing so long last night, sir? I don’t\r\npresume to say anything against the air of these latitudes; but I should\r\nbe glad to know it wasn’t you that was a-coughing so hollow. Would you\r\nbe so obliging as just to feel the state of these ropes with the ends of\r\nyour fingers, sir? You can dry them afterward on the back of my jacket.”\r\n\r\n“You ought to have a stick laid on the back of your jacket. Take that\r\nbox down to the boat directly. You croaking vagabond! You would have\r\ngrumbled in the Garden of Eden.”\r\n\r\nThe philosopher of the Expedition was not a man to be silenced by\r\nreferring him to the Garden of Eden. Paradise itself was not perfect to\r\nJohn Want.\r\n\r\n“I hope I could be cheerful anywhere, sir,” said the ship’s cook. “But\r\nyou mark my words--there must have been a deal of troublesome work with\r\nthe flower-beds in the Garden of Eden.”\r\n\r\nHaving entered that unanswerable protest, John Want shouldered the box,\r\nand drifted drearily out of the boat-house.\r\n\r\nLeft by himself, Crayford looked at his watch, and called to a sailor\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n“Where are the ladies?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Crayford is coming this way, sir. She was just behind you when you\r\ncame in.”\r\n\r\n“Is Miss Burnham with her?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir; Miss Burnham is down on the beach with the passengers. I heard\r\nthe young lady asking after you, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Asking after me?” Crayford considered with himself as he repeated the\r\nwords. He added, in lower and graver tones, “You had better tell Miss\r\nBurnham you have seen me here.”\r\n\r\nThe man made his salute and went out. Crayford took a turn in the\r\nboat-house.\r\n\r\nRescued from death in the Arctic wastes, and reunited to a beautiful\r\nwife, the lieutenant looked, nevertheless, unaccountably anxious and\r\ndepressed. What could he be thinking of? He was thinking of Clara.\r\n\r\nOn the first day when the rescued men were received on board the\r\n_Amazon_, Clara had embarrassed and distressed, not Crayford only, but\r\nthe other officers of the Expedition as well, by the manner in which she\r\nquestioned them on the subject of Francis Aldersley and Richard Wardour.\r\nShe had shown no signs of dismay or despair when she heard that no news\r\nhad been received of the two missing men. She had even smiled sadly to\r\nherself, when Crayford (out of compassionate regard for her) declared\r\nthat he and his comrades had not given up the hope of seeing Frank and\r\nWardour yet. It was only when the lieutenant had expressed himself in\r\nthose terms and when it was hoped that the painful subject had been\r\ndismissed--that Clara had startled every one present by announcing that\r\nshe had something still to say in relation to Frank and Wardour, which\r\nhad not been said yet. Though she spoke guardedly, her next words\r\nrevealed suspicions of foul play lurking in her mind--exactly reflecting\r\nsimilar suspicions lurking in Crayford’s mind--which so distressed\r\nthe lieutenant, and so surprised his comrades, as to render them quite\r\nincapable of answering her. The warnings of the storm which shortly\r\nafterward broke over the vessel were then visible in sea and sky.\r\nCrayford made them his excuse for abruptly leaving the cabin in which\r\nthe conversation had taken place. His brother officers, profiting by his\r\nexample, pleaded their duties on deck, and followed him out.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, and the next, the tempest still raged--and the\r\npassengers were not able to leave their state-rooms. But now, when the\r\nweather had moderated and the ship had anchored--now, when officers\r\nand passengers alike were on shore, with leisure time at their\r\ndisposal--Clara had opportunities of returning to the subject of the\r\nlost men, and of asking questions in relation to them which would make\r\nit impossible for Crayford to plead an excuse for not answering her. How\r\nwas he to meet those questions? How could he still keep her in ignorance\r\nof the truth?\r\n\r\nThese were the reflections which now troubled Crayford, and which\r\npresented him, after his rescue, in the strangely inappropriate\r\ncharacter of a depressed and anxious man. His brother officers, as\r\nhe well knew, looked to him to take the chief responsibility. If he\r\ndeclined to accept it, he would instantly confirm the horrible suspicion\r\nin Clara’s mind. The emergency must be met; but how to meet it--at once\r\nhonorably and mercifully--was more than Crayford could tell. He\r\nwas still lost in his own gloomy thoughts when his wife entered the\r\nboat-house. Turning to look at her, he saw his own perturbations and\r\nanxieties plainly reflected in Mrs. Crayford’s face.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen anything of Clara?” he asked. “Is she still on the\r\nbeach?”\r\n\r\n“She is following me to this place,” Mrs. Crayford replied. “I have been\r\nspeaking to her this morning. She is just as resolute as ever to insist\r\non your telling her of the circumstances under which Frank is missing.\r\nAs things are, you have no alternative but to answer her.”\r\n\r\n“Help me to answer her, Lucy. Tell me, before she comes in, how this\r\ndreadful suspicion first took possession of her. All she could possibly\r\nhave known when we left England was that the two men were appointed to\r\nseparate ships. What could have led her to suspect that they had come\r\ntogether?”\r\n\r\n“She was firmly persuaded, William, that they _would_ come together when\r\nthe Expedition left England. And she had read in books of Arctic travel,\r\nof men left behind by their comrades on the march, and of men adrift on\r\nice-bergs. With her mind full of these images and forebodings, she saw\r\nFrank and Wardour (or dreamed of them) in one of her attacks of trance.\r\nI was by her side; I heard what she said at the time. She warned Frank\r\nthat Wardour had discovered the truth. She called out to him, ‘While you\r\ncan stand, keep with the other men, Frank!’”\r\n\r\n“Good God!” cried Crayford; “I warned him myself, almost in those very\r\nwords, the last time I saw him!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t acknowledge it, William! Keep her in ignorance of what you\r\nhave just told me. She will not take it for what it is--a startling\r\ncoincidence, and nothing more. She will accept it as positive\r\nconfirmation of the faith, the miserable superstitious faith, that is in\r\nher. So long as you don’t actually know that Frank is dead, and that he\r\nhas died by Wardour’s hand, deny what she says--mislead her for her own\r\nsake--dispute all her conclusions as I dispute them. Help me to raise\r\nher to the better and nobler belief in the mercy of God!” She stopped,\r\nand looked round nervously at the doorway. “Hush!” she whispered. “Do as\r\nI have told you. Clara is here.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nClara stopped at the doorway, looking backward and forward distrustfully\r\nbetween the husband and wife. Entering the boat-house, and approaching\r\nCrayford, she took his arm, and led him away a few steps from the place\r\nin which Mrs. Crayford was standing.\r\n\r\n“There is no storm now, and there are no duties to be done on board the\r\nship,” she said, with the faint, sad smile which it wrung Crayford’s\r\nheart to see. “You are Lucy’s husband, and you have an interest in me\r\nfor Lucy’s sake. Don’t shrink on that account from giving me pain: I\r\ncan bear pain. Friend and brother! will you believe that I have courage\r\nenough to hear the worst? Will you promise not to deceive me about\r\nFrank?”\r\n\r\nThe gentle resignation in her voice, the sad pleading in her look, shook\r\nCrayford’s self-possession at the outset. He answered her in the worst\r\npossible manner; he answered evasively.\r\n\r\n“My dear Clara,” he said, “what have I done that you should suspect me\r\nof deceiving you?”\r\n\r\nShe looked him searchingly in the face, then glanced with renewed\r\ndistrust at Mrs. Crayford. There was a moment of silence. Before any of\r\nthe three could speak again, they were interrupted by the appearance of\r\none of Crayford’s brother officers, followed by two sailors carrying a\r\nhamper between them. Crayford instantly dropped Clara’s arm, and seized\r\nthe welcome opportunity of speaking of other things.\r\n\r\n“Any instructions from the ship, Steventon?” he asked, approaching the\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n“Verbal instructions only,” Steventon replied. “The ship will sail with\r\nthe flood-tide. We shall fire a gun to collect the people, and send\r\nanother boat ashore. In the meantime here are some refreshments for the\r\npassengers. The ship is in a state of confusion; the ladies will eat\r\ntheir luncheon more comfortably here.”\r\n\r\nHearing this, Mrs. Crayford took _her_ opportunity of silencing Clara\r\nnext.\r\n\r\n“Come, my dear,” she said. “Let us lay the cloth before the gentlemen\r\ncome in.”\r\n\r\nClara was too seriously bent on attaining the object which she had\r\nin view to be silenced in that way. “I will help you directly,” she\r\nanswered--then crossed the room and addressed herself to the officer,\r\nwhose name was Steventon.\r\n\r\n“Can you spare me a few minutes?” she asked. “I have something to say to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I am entirely at your service, Miss Burnham.”\r\n\r\nAnswering in those words, Steventon dismissed the two sailors. Mrs.\r\nCrayford looked anxiously at her husband. Crayford whispered to her,\r\n“Don’t be alarmed about Steventon. I have cautioned him; his discretion\r\nis to be depended on.”\r\n\r\nClara beckoned to Crayford to return to her.\r\n\r\n“I will not keep you long,” she said. “I will promise not to distress\r\nMr. Steventon. Young as I am, you shall both find that I am capable\r\nof self-control. I won’t ask you to go back to the story of your past\r\nsufferings; I only want to be sure that I am right about one thing--I\r\nmean about what happened at the time when the exploring party was\r\ndispatched in search of help. As I understand it, you cast lots among\r\nyourselves who was to go with the party, and who was to remain behind.\r\nFrank cast the lot to go.” She paused, shuddering. “And Richard\r\nWardour,” she went on, “cast the lot to remain behind. On your honor, as\r\nofficers and gentlemen, is this the truth?”\r\n\r\n“On my honor,” Crayford answered, “it is the truth.”\r\n\r\n“On my honor,” Steventon repeated, “it is the truth.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at them, carefully considering her next words, before she\r\nspoke again.\r\n\r\n“You both drew the lot to stay in the huts,” she said, addressing\r\nCrayford and Steventon. “And you are both here. Richard Wardour drew the\r\nlot to stay, and Richard Wardour is not here. How does his name come to\r\nbe with Frank’s on the list of the missing?”\r\n\r\nThe question was a dangerous one to answer. Steventon left it to\r\nCrayford to reply. Once again he answered evasively.\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t follow, my dear,” he said, “that the two men were missing\r\ntogether because their names happen to come together on the list.”\r\n\r\nClara instantly drew the inevitable conclusion from that ill-considered\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n“Frank is missing from the party of relief,” she said. “Am I to\r\nunderstand that Wardour is missing from the huts?”\r\n\r\nBoth Crayford and Steventon hesitated. Mrs. Crayford cast one indignant\r\nlook at them, and told the necessary lie, without a moment’s hesitation!\r\n\r\n“Yes!” she said. “Wardour is missing from the huts.”\r\n\r\nQuickly as she had spoken, she had still spoken too late. Clara had\r\nnoticed the momentary hesitation on the part of the two officers. She\r\nturned to Steventon.\r\n\r\n“I trust to your honor,” she said, quietly. “Am I right, or wrong, in\r\nbelieving that Mrs. Crayford is mistaken?”\r\n\r\nShe had addressed herself to the right man of the two. Steventon had\r\nno wife present to exercise authority over him. Steventon, put on his\r\nhonor, and fairly forced to say something, owned the truth. Wardour had\r\nreplaced an officer whom accident had disabled from accompanying the\r\nparty of relief, and Wardour and Frank were missing together.\r\n\r\nClara looked at Mrs. Crayford.\r\n\r\n“You hear?” she said. “It is you who are mistaken, not I. What you\r\ncall ‘Accident,’ what I call ‘Fate,’ brought Richard Wardour and Frank\r\ntogether as members of the same Expedition, after all.” Without waiting\r\nfor a reply, she again turned to Steventon, and surprised him by\r\nchanging the painful subject of the conversation of her own accord.\r\n\r\n“Have you been in the Highlands of Scotland?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“I have never been in the Highlands,” the lieutenant replied.\r\n\r\n“Have you ever read, in books about the Highlands, of such a thing as\r\n‘The Second Sight’?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Do you believe in the Second Sight?”\r\n\r\nSteventon politely declined to commit himself to a direct reply.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what I might have done, if I had ever been in the\r\nHighlands,” he said. “As it is, I have had no opportunities of giving\r\nthe subject any serious consideration.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t put your credulity to the test,” Clara proceeded. “I won’t ask\r\nyou to believe anything more extraordinary than that I had a strange\r\ndream in England not very long since. My dream showed me what you have\r\njust acknowledged--and more than that. How did the two missing men come\r\nto be parted from their companions? Were they lost by pure accident, or\r\nwere they deliberately left behind on the march?”\r\n\r\nCrayford made a last vain effort to check her inquiries at the point\r\nwhich they had now reached.\r\n\r\n“Neither Steventon nor I were members of the party of relief,” he said.\r\n“How are we to answer you?”\r\n\r\n“Your brother officers who _were_ members of the party must have told\r\nyou what happened,” Clara rejoined. “I only ask you and Mr. Steventon to\r\ntell me what they told you.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford interposed again, with a practical suggestion this time.\r\n\r\n“The luncheon is not unpacked yet,” she said. “Come, Clara! this is our\r\nbusiness, and the time is passing.”\r\n\r\n“The luncheon can wait a few minutes longer,” Clara answered. “Bear with\r\nmy obstinacy,” she went on, laying her hand caressingly on Crayford’s\r\nshoulder. “Tell me how those two came to be separated from the rest. You\r\nhave always been the kindest of friends--don’t begin to be cruel to me\r\nnow!”\r\n\r\nThe tone in which she made her entreaty to Crayford went straight to\r\nthe sailor’s heart. He gave up the hopeless struggle: he let her see a\r\nglimpse of the truth.\r\n\r\n“On the third day out,” he said, “Frank’s strength failed him. He fell\r\nbehind the rest from fatigue.”\r\n\r\n“Surely they waited for him?”\r\n\r\n“It was a serious risk to wait for him, my child. Their lives (and the\r\nlives of the men they had left in the huts) depended, in that dreadful\r\nclimate, on their pushing on. But Frank was a favorite. They waited half\r\na day to give Frank the chance of recovering his strength.”\r\n\r\nThere he stopped. There the imprudence into which his fondness for Clara\r\nhad led him showed itself plainly, and closed his lips.\r\n\r\nIt was too late to take refuge in silence. Clara was determined on\r\nhearing more.\r\n\r\nShe questioned Steventon next.\r\n\r\n“Did Frank go on again after the half-day’s rest?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“He tried to go on--”\r\n\r\n“And failed?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What did the men do when he failed? Did they turn cowards? Did they\r\ndesert Frank?”\r\n\r\nShe had purposely used language which might irritate Steventon into\r\nanswering her plainly. He was a young man--he fell into the snare that\r\nshe had set for him.\r\n\r\n“Not one among them was a coward, Miss Burnham!” he replied, warmly.\r\n“You are speaking cruelly and unjustly of as brave a set of fellows as\r\never lived! The strongest man among them set the example; he volunteered\r\nto stay by Frank, and to bring him on in the track of the exploring\r\nparty.”\r\n\r\nThere Steventon stopped--conscious, on his side, that he had said too\r\nmuch. Would she ask him who this volunteer was? No. She went straight on\r\nto the most embarrassing question that she had put yet--referring to the\r\nvolunteer, as if Steventon had already mentioned his name.\r\n\r\n“What made Richard Wardour so ready to risk his life for Frank’s sake?”\r\n she said to Crayford. “Did he do it out of friendship for Frank? Surely\r\nyou can tell me that? Carry your memory back to the days when you were\r\nall living in the huts. Were Frank and Wardour friends at that time? Did\r\nyou never hear any angry words pass between them?”\r\n\r\nThere Mrs. Crayford saw her opportunity of giving her husband a timely\r\nhint.\r\n\r\n“My dear child!” she said; “how can you expect him to remember that?\r\nThere must have been plenty of quarrels among the men, all shut up\r\ntogether, and all weary of each other’s company, no doubt.”\r\n\r\n“Plenty of quarrels!” Crayford repeated; “and every one of them made up\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“And every one of them made up again,” Mrs. Crayford reiterated, in her\r\nturn. “There! a plainer answer than that you can’t wish to have. Now are\r\nyou satisfied? Mr. Steventon, come and lend a hand (as you say at sea)\r\nwith the hamper--Clara won’t help me. William, don’t stand there doing\r\nnothing. This hamper holds a great deal; we must have a division of\r\nlabor. Your division shall be laying the tablecloth. Don’t handle it\r\nin that clumsy way! You unfold a table-cloth as if you were unfurling\r\na sail. Put the knives on the right, and the forks on the left, and the\r\nnapkin and the bread between them. Clara, if you are not hungry in this\r\nfine air, you ought to be. Come and do your duty; come and have some\r\nlunch!”\r\n\r\nShe looked up as she spoke. Clara appeared to have yielded at last to\r\nthe conspiracy to keep her in the dark. She had returned slowly to the\r\nboat-house doorway, and she was standing alone on the threshold, looking\r\nout. Approaching her to lead her to the luncheon-table, Mrs. Crayford\r\ncould hear that she was speaking softly to herself. She was repeating\r\nthe farewell words which Richard Wardour had spoken to her at the ball.\r\n\r\n“‘A time may come when I shall forgive _you_. But the man who has robbed\r\nme of you shall rue the day when you and he first met.’ Oh, Frank!\r\nFrank! does Richard still live, with your blood on his conscience, and\r\nmy image in his heart?”\r\n\r\nHer lips suddenly closed. She started, and drew back from the doorway,\r\ntrembling violently. Mrs. Crayford looked out at the quiet seaward view.\r\n\r\n“Anything there that frightens you, my dear?” she asked. “I can see\r\nnothing, except the boats drawn up on the beach.”\r\n\r\n“_I_ can see nothing either, Lucy.”\r\n\r\n“And yet you are trembling as if there was something dreadful in the\r\nview from this door.”\r\n\r\n“There _is_ something dreadful! I feel it, though I see nothing. I feel\r\nit, nearer and nearer in the empty air, darker and darker in the sunny\r\nlight. I don’t know what it is. Take me away! No. Not out on the beach.\r\nI can’t pass the door. Somewhere else! somewhere else!”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford looked round her, and noticed a second door at the inner\r\nend of the boat-house. She spoke to her husband.\r\n\r\n“See where that door leads to, William.”\r\n\r\nCrayford opened the door. It led into a desolate inclosure, half garden,\r\nhalf yard. Some nets stretched on poles were hanging up to dry. No other\r\nobjects were visible--not a living creature appeared in the place. “It\r\ndoesn’t look very inviting, my dear,” said Mrs. Crayford. “I am at your\r\nservice, however. What do you say?”\r\n\r\nShe offered her arm to Clara as she spoke. Clara refused it. She took\r\nCrayford’s arm, and clung to him.\r\n\r\n“I’m frightened, dreadfully frightened!” she said to him, faintly. “You\r\nkeep with me--a woman is no protection; I want to be with you.” She\r\nlooked round again at the boat-house doorway. “Oh!” she whispered, “I’m\r\ncold all over--I’m frozen with fear of this place. Come into the yard!\r\nCome into the yard!”\r\n\r\n“Leave her to me,” said Crayford to his wife. “I will call you, if she\r\ndoesn’t get better in the open air.”\r\n\r\nHe took her out at once, and closed the yard door behind them.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Steventon, do you understand this?” asked Mrs. Crayford. “What can\r\nshe possibly be frightened of?”\r\n\r\nShe put the question, still looking mechanically at the door by which\r\nher husband and Clara had gone out. Receiving no reply, she glanced\r\nround at Steventon. He was standing on the opposite side of the\r\nluncheon-table, with his eyes fixed attentively on the view from the\r\nmain doorway of the boat-house. Mrs. Crayford looked where Steventon was\r\nlooking. This time there was something visible. She saw the shadow of a\r\nhuman figure projected on the stretch of smooth yellow sand in front of\r\nthe boat-house.\r\n\r\nIn a moment more the figure appeared. A man came slowly into view, and\r\nstopped on the threshold of the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man was a sinister and terrible object to look at. His eyes glared\r\nlike the eyes of a wild animal; his head was bare; his long gray hair\r\nwas torn and tangled; his miserable garments hung about him in rags. He\r\nstood in the doorway, a speechless figure of misery and want, staring at\r\nthe well-spread table like a hungry dog.\r\n\r\nSteventon spoke to him.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?”\r\n\r\nHe answered, in a hoarse, hollow voice,\r\n\r\n“A starving man.”\r\n\r\nHe advanced a few steps, slowly and painfully, as if he were sinking\r\nunder fatigue.\r\n\r\n“Throw me some bones from the table,” he said. “Give me my share along\r\nwith the dogs.”\r\n\r\nThere was madness as well as hunger in his eyes while he spoke those\r\nwords. Steventon placed Mrs. Crayford behind him, so that he might be\r\neasily able to protect her in case of need, and beckoned to two sailors\r\nwho were passing the door of the boat-house at the time.\r\n\r\n“Give the man some bread and meat,” he said, “and wait near him.”\r\n\r\nThe outcast seized on the bread and meat with lean, long-nailed hands\r\nthat looked like claws. After his first mouthful of the food, he\r\nstopped, considered vacantly with himself, and broke the bread and meat\r\ninto two portions. One portion he put into an old canvas wallet that\r\nhung over his shoulder; the other he devoured voraciously. Steventon\r\nquestioned him.\r\n\r\n“Where do you come from?”\r\n\r\n“From the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Wrecked?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nSteventon turned to Mrs. Crayford.\r\n\r\n“There may be some truth in the poor wretch’s story,” he said. “I heard\r\nsomething of a strange boat having been cast on the beach thirty or\r\nforty miles higher up the coast. When were you wrecked, my man?”\r\n\r\nThe starving creature looked up from his food, and made an effort to\r\ncollect his thoughts--to exert his memory. It was not to be done. He\r\ngave up the attempt in despair. His language, when he spoke, was as wild\r\nas his looks.\r\n\r\n“I can’t tell you,” he said. “I can’t get the wash of the sea out of my\r\nears. I can’t get the shining stars all night, and the burning sun all\r\nday, out of my brain. When was I wrecked? When was I first adrift in the\r\nboat? When did I get the tiller in my hand and fight against hunger and\r\nsleep? When did the gnawing in my breast, and the burning in my head,\r\nfirst begin? I have lost all reckoning of it. I can’t think; I can’t\r\nsleep; I can’t get the wash of the sea out of my ears. What are you\r\nbaiting me with questions for? Let me eat!”\r\n\r\nEven the sailors pitied him. The sailors asked leave of their officer to\r\nadd a little drink to his meal.\r\n\r\n“We’ve got a drop of grog with us, sir, in a bottle. May we give it to\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly!”\r\n\r\nHe took the bottle fiercely, as he had taken the food, drank a little,\r\nstopped, and considered with himself again. He held up the bottle to the\r\nlight, and, marking how much liquor it contained, carefully drank half\r\nof it only. This done, he put the bottle in his wallet along with the\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n“Are you saving it up for another time?” said Steventon.\r\n\r\n“I’m saving it up,” the man answered. “Never mind what for. That’s my\r\nsecret.”\r\n\r\nHe looked round the boat-house as he made that reply, and noticed Mrs.\r\nCrayford for the first time.\r\n\r\n“A woman among you!” he said. “Is she English? Is she young? Let me look\r\ncloser at her.”\r\n\r\nHe advanced a few steps toward the table.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be afraid, Mrs. Crayford,” said Steventon.\r\n\r\n“I am not afraid,” Mrs. Crayford replied. “He frightened me at first--he\r\ninterests me now. Let him speak to me if he wishes it!”\r\n\r\nHe never spoke. He stood, in dead silence, looking long and anxiously at\r\nthe beautiful Englishwoman.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Steventon.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head sadly, and drew back again with a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n“No!” he said to himself, “that’s not _her_ face. No! not found yet.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford’s interest was strongly excited. She ventured to speak to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Who is it you want to find?” she asked. “Your wife?”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head again.\r\n\r\n“Who, then? What is she like?”\r\n\r\nHe answered that question in words. His hoarse, hollow voice softened,\r\nlittle by little, into sorrowful and gentle tones.\r\n\r\n“Young,” he said; “with a fair, sad face--with kind, tender eyes--with a\r\nsoft, clear voice. Young and loving and merciful. I keep her face in\r\nmy mind, though I can keep nothing else. I must wander, wander,\r\nwander--restless, sleepless, homeless--till I find _her!_ Over the ice\r\nand over the snow; tossing on the sea, tramping over the land; awake all\r\nnight, awake all day; wander, wander, wander, till I find _her!_”\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand with a gesture of farewell, and turned wearily to go\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Crayford opened the yard door.\r\n\r\n“I think you had better come to Clara,” he began, and checked himself,\r\nnoticing the stranger. “Who is that?”\r\n\r\nThe shipwrecked man, hearing another voice in the room, looked round\r\nslowly over his shoulder. Struck by his appearance, Crayford advanced\r\na little nearer to him. Mrs. Crayford spoke to her husband as he passed\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“It’s only a poor, mad creature, William,” she whispered--“shipwrecked\r\nand starving.”\r\n\r\n“Mad?” Crayford repeated, approaching nearer and nearer to the man. “Am\r\n_I_ in my right senses?” He suddenly sprang on the outcast, and seized\r\nhim by the throat. “Richard Wardour!” he cried, in a voice of fury.\r\n“Alive!--alive, to answer for Frank!”\r\n\r\nThe man struggled. Crayford held him.\r\n\r\n“Where is Frank?” he said. “You villain, where is Frank?”\r\n\r\nThe man resisted no longer. He repeated vacantly,\r\n\r\n“Villain? and where is Frank?”\r\n\r\nAs the name escaped his lips, Clara appeared at the open yard door, and\r\nhurried into the room.\r\n\r\n“I heard Richard’s name!” she said. “I heard Frank’s name! What does it\r\nmean?”\r\n\r\nAt the sound of her voice the outcast renewed the struggle to free\r\nhimself, with a sudden frenzy of strength which Crayford was not able to\r\nresist. He broke away before the sailors could come to their officer’s\r\nassistance. Half-way down the length of the room he and Clara met one\r\nanother face to face. A new light sparkled in the poor wretch’s eyes; a\r\ncry of recognition burst from his lips. He flung one hand up wildly in\r\nthe air. “Found!” he shouted, and rushed out to the beach before any of\r\nthe men present could stop him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crayford put her arms round Clara and held her up. She had not made\r\na movement: she had not spoken a word. The sight of Wardour’s face had\r\npetrified her.\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed, and there rose a sudden burst of cheering from the\r\nsailors on the beach, near the spot where the fishermen’s boats were\r\ndrawn up. Every man left his work. Every man waved his cap in the air.\r\nThe passengers, near at hand, caught the infection of enthusiasm, and\r\njoined the crew. A moment more, and Richard Wardour appeared again in\r\nthe doorway, carrying a man in his arms. He staggered, breathless with\r\nthe effort that he was making, to the place where Clara stood, held up\r\nin Mrs. Crayford’s arms.\r\n\r\n“Saved, Clara!” he cried. “Saved for _you!_”\r\n\r\nHe released the man, and placed him in Clara’s arms.\r\n\r\nFrank! foot-sore and weary--but living--saved; saved for _her!_\r\n\r\n“Now, Clara!” cried Mrs. Crayford, “which of us is right? I who believed\r\nin the mercy of God? or you who believed in a dream?”\r\n\r\nShe never answered; she clung to Frank in speechless ecstasy. She never\r\neven looked at the man who had preserved him, in the first absorbing joy\r\nof seeing Frank alive. Step by step, slower and slower, Richard Wardour\r\ndrew back, and left them by themselves.\r\n\r\n“I may rest now,” he said, faintly. “I may sleep at last. The task is\r\ndone. The struggle is over.”\r\n\r\nHis last reserves of strength had been given to Frank. He stopped--he\r\nstaggered--his hands waved feebly in search of support. But for one\r\nfaithful friend he would have fallen. Crayford caught him. Crayford laid\r\nhis old comrade gently on some sails strewn in a corner, and pillowed\r\nWardour’s weary head on his own bosom. The tears streamed over his face.\r\n“Richard! dear Richard!” he said. “Remember--and forgive me.”\r\n\r\nRichard neither heeded nor heard him. His dim eyes still looked across\r\nthe room at Clara and Frank.\r\n\r\n“I have made _her_ happy!” he murmured. “I may lay down my weary head\r\nnow on the mother earth that hushes all her children to rest at last.\r\nSink, heart! sink, sink to rest! Oh, look at them!” he said to Crayford,\r\nwith a burst of grief. “They have forgotten _me_ already.”\r\n\r\nIt was true! The interest was all with the two lovers. Frank was young\r\nand handsome and popular. Officers, passengers, and sailors, they all\r\ncrowded round Frank. They all forgot the martyred man who had saved\r\nhim--the man who was dying in Crayford’s arms.\r\n\r\nCrayford tried once more to attract his attention--to win his\r\nrecognition while there was yet time. “Richard, speak to me! Speak to\r\nyour old friend!”\r\n\r\nHe look round; he vacantly repeated Crayford’s last word.\r\n\r\n“Friend?” he said. “My eyes are dim, friend--my mind is dull. I have\r\nlost all memories but the memory of _her_. Dead thoughts--all dead\r\nthoughts but that one! And yet you look at me kindly! Why has your face\r\ngone down with the wreck of all the rest?”\r\n\r\nHe paused; his face changed; his thoughts drifted back from present to\r\npast; he looked at Crayford vacantly, lost in the terrible remembrances\r\nthat were rising in him, as the shadows rise with the coming night.\r\n\r\n“Hark ye, friend,” he whispered. “Never let Frank know it. There was a\r\ntime when the fiend within me hungered for his life. I had my hands on\r\nthe boat. I heard the voice of the Tempter speaking to me: Launch it,\r\nand leave him to die! I waited with my hands on the boat, and my eyes on\r\nthe place where he slept. ‘Leave him! leave him!’ the voice whispered.\r\n‘Love him!’ the lad’s voice answered, moaning and murmuring in his\r\nsleep. ‘Love him, Clara, for helping _me!_’ I heard the morning wind\r\ncome up in the silence over the great deep. Far and near, I heard the\r\ngroaning of the floating ice; floating, floating to the clear water and\r\nthe balmy air. And the wicked Voice floated away with it--away, away,\r\naway forever! ‘Love him! love him, Clara, for helping _me!_’ No wind\r\ncould float that away! ‘Love him, Clara--’”\r\n\r\nHis voice sank into silence; his head dropped on Crayford’s breast.\r\nFrank saw it. Frank struggled up on his bleeding feet and parted the\r\nfriendly throng round him. Frank had not forgotten the man who had saved\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Let me go to him!” he cried. “I must and will go to him! Clara, come\r\nwith me.”\r\n\r\nClara and Steventon supported him between them. He fell on his knees at\r\nWardour’s side; he put his hand on Wardour’s bosom.\r\n\r\n“Richard!”\r\n\r\nThe weary eyes opened again. The sinking voice was heard feebly once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n“Ah! poor Frank. I didn’t forget you, Frank, when I came here to beg.\r\nI remembered you lying down outside in the shadow of the boats. I saved\r\nyou your share of the food and drink. Too weak to get at it now! A\r\nlittle rest, Frank! I shall soon be strong enough to carry you down to\r\nthe ship.”\r\n\r\nThe end was near. They all saw it now. The men reverently uncovered\r\ntheir heads in the presence of Death. In an agony of despair, Frank\r\nappealed to the friends round him.\r\n\r\n“Get something to strengthen him, for God’s sake! Oh, men! men! I should\r\nnever have been here but for him! He has given all his strength to my\r\nweakness; and now, see how strong I am, and how weak _he_ is! Clara, I\r\nheld by his arm all over the ice and snow. _He_ kept watch when I was\r\nsenseless in the open boat. _His_ hand dragged me out of the waves when\r\nwe were wrecked. Speak to him, Clara! speak to him!” His voice failed\r\nhim, and his head dropped on Wardour’s breast.\r\n\r\nShe spoke, as well as her tears would let her.\r\n\r\n“Richard, have you forgotten me?”\r\n\r\nHe rallied at the sound of that beloved voice. He looked up at her as\r\nshe knelt at his head.\r\n\r\n“Forgotten you?” Still looking at her, he lifted his hand with an\r\neffort, and laid it on Frank. “Should I have been strong enough to save\r\nhim, if I could have forgotten you?” He waited a moment and turned his\r\nface feebly toward Crayford. “Stay!” he said. “Someone was here and\r\nspoke to me.” A faint light of recognition glimmered in his eyes. “Ah,\r\nCrayford! I recollect now. Dear Crayford! come nearer! My mind clears,\r\nbut my eyes grow dim. You will remember me kindly for Frank’s sake? Poor\r\nFrank! why does he hide his face? Is he crying? Nearer, Clara--I want to\r\nlook my last at _you_. My sister, Clara! Kiss me, sister, kiss me before\r\nI die!”\r\n\r\nShe stooped and kissed his forehead. A faint smile trembled on his\r\nlips. It passed away; and stillness possessed the face--the stillness of\r\nDeath.\r\n\r\nCrayford’s voice was heard in the silence.\r\n\r\n“The loss is ours,” he said. “The gain is his. He has won the greatest\r\nof all conquests--the conquest of himself. And he has died in the moment\r\nof victory. Not one of us here but may live to envy _his_ glorious\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\nThe distant report of a gun came from the ship in the offing, and\r\nsignaled the return to England and to home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Frozen Deep, by Wilkie Collins\r\n\r\n***",
