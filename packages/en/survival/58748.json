FONTENAY\r\n\r\n             _It was a duel to the death and Kraag had all\r\n            the advantages, including offense and defense.\r\n          Jonner had neither, but he employed an old equation\r\n            peculiarly adaptable to the situation. And the\r\n                 proper equation properly worked...._\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Worlds of If Science Fiction, October 1954.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMurdering Stein was easy. Kraag waited until Jonner donned his\r\nspacesuit and went out to have a personal look at the asteroid. Even\r\nthen Kraag held his patience, because he wanted Jonner to come back to\r\nthe ship unsuspecting.\r\n\r\nKraag sat tensely at the back of the control room while Stein, the\r\nnavigator and communications man, operated the radio. There was a brief\r\nperiod when Stein talked with Marsport, then he got in touch with\r\nJonner. Until Jonner got some distance from the wrecked ship, most of\r\ntheir conversation was an argument.\r\n\r\n\"I still think two of us ought to go out and one stay at the ship,\"\r\nargued Stein. \"Kraag agrees with me. What if you fall into a crevice?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's not much danger, and you've got a directional fix on me,\"\r\nreplied Jonner's voice through the loudspeaker. \"If we had a large\r\ncrew, I'd agree we ought to explore in pairs. Since there are just\r\nthree of us, only one ought to be endangered at a time. I'm the\r\ncaptain, so I'm it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't get out of sight,\" warned Stein. \"We don't have an\r\natmosphere here to bounce radio waves over the horizon.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the glassite port, Kraag could see Jonner poking around at\r\nthe asteroid's surface with his steel probe. Against the incredibly\r\ncurved horizon, Jonner's suited figure leaned at a slight angle under\r\nthe black, star-studded sky. The distant sun gleamed from the sphere of\r\nhis helmet.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty smooth terrain,\" remarked Jonner. \"It's not much of a planet,\r\nbut it seems to have enough mass to pull down any mountains. Looks like\r\nthere should be some hills, though. It must have been in a molten state\r\nwhen the original trans-Martian planet was broken up.\"\r\n\r\n\"That ought to mean high albedo,\" said Stein. \"Higher than it ought to\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds more like Vesta,\" said Jonner. \"Sure we're on Ceres?\"\r\n\r\nStein looked at the notes he had made from the ship's instruments,\r\nbefore the crash.\r\n\r\n\"The escape velocity was 1,552.41 feet per second,\" he said, \"and the\r\ndiameter 0.06. I figure the mass at .000108.\"\r\n\r\n\"All those figures are off according to the latest table for Ceres,\"\r\nsaid Jonner.\r\n\r\n\"The fellows that made that table were on Mars,\" reminded Stein. \"Vesta\r\ndoesn't have a 480-mile diameter. It must be Ceres.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're the navigator,\" surrendered Jonner. \"I'll take your word for\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThe personnel sphere of the ship rested on the ground, tilted at almost\r\na 20-degree angle from the horizontal. The tilt was no inconvenience,\r\nhowever. Each of the men weighed only five or six pounds here, and\r\nslippage was hardly noticeable.\r\n\r\n\"I'll turn you over to Kraag,\" said Stein at last, glancing up at the\r\nchronometer. \"It's my day to fix supper, you know.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the signal Kraag had been waiting for. He reached behind him and\r\nfumbled in the rack for a gun.\r\n\r\nThe one he brought out was Jonner's, and it wasn't a heat-gun but the\r\nancient pistol Jonner swore by. Kraag put it back hurriedly, but not\r\nbefore Stein had turned in his chair and seen it.\r\n\r\n\"What's up, Kraag?\" asked Stein without alarm. \"Why the gun?\"\r\n\r\nKraag pulled a heat-gun from the rack.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing's up,\" he said, and shot Stein.\r\n\r\nThe ray burned into Stein's shoulder, and Kraag swung it down across\r\nStein's chest to his stomach before relaxing his pressure on the\r\ntrigger.\r\n\r\n\"My God, Kraag!\" gurgled Stein. Summoning a last effort, he croaked\r\ninto the microphone: \"Jonner! Watch out! Kraag shot....\"\r\n\r\nKraag blasted him in the face, cutting him off. Stein's body floated\r\nforward and upward out of the chair and began to settle slowly toward\r\nthe slanting floor.\r\n\r\n\"What's going on, Stein?\" came Jonner's alarmed voice over the\r\nloudspeaker. \"Stein? Stein!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, Jonner,\" said Kraag as calmly as he could, when he\r\ncould reach the microphone. \"Stein just fainted.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence from Jonner.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take care of Stein and then take over the mike till you get ready\r\nto come in,\" said Kraag into the microphone.\r\n\r\n\"I want to talk to Stein when he comes around,\" said Jonner. His voice\r\nsounded cold.\r\n\r\nSo Jonner suspected something. Well, that couldn't be helped. Maybe he\r\ncould be talked around.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Jonner,\" agreed Kraag soothingly.\r\n\r\nStein's body had to be hidden from Jonner, just in case. Jonner got\r\ninto the personnel sphere alive--something Kraag did not intend for\r\nhim to do. When he had taken care of Jonner, he could dispose of both\r\nbodies before the rescue ship got there.\r\n\r\nDragging Stein's body was like towing someone through water. It floated\r\nthrough the air of the sphere at Kraag's tug, settling slowly. His only\r\nproblem was getting good leverage for pushing. After some cogitation,\r\nhe jammed the body into an empty food compartment two decks below the\r\ncontrol room.\r\n\r\nBack in the control room, Kraag looked out the port. Jonner was closer\r\nto the personnel sphere now, looking toward it but not moving.\r\n\r\nOther portions of the ship, some jettisoned, some crumpled and broken\r\napart by its crash, lay at varying distances from the personnel sphere.\r\nSome of the parts were scattered out of sight beyond the horizon, a\r\nmile away.\r\n\r\nKraag had not wanted to fool with the asteroid. There had been no\r\nquestion that they had to swing back off their original orbit toward\r\nTitan when the meteorite slashed open both of their hydrazine tanks.\r\nBut Kraag's idea had been to stay in space and try to turn back toward\r\nMars before the fuel gave out.\r\n\r\nAs the engineer, Kraag resented Jonner overruling him. Jonner had felt\r\nit safer to take an orbit around the asteroid and wait for rescue. But\r\nthe fuel pumps had failed before they could adjust to the orbit. Kraag\r\nwould never forget that helpless waiting as they circled and circled,\r\nspiraling downward to the inevitable crash.\r\n\r\nHe went back to the microphone.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, Jonner,\" he said. \"What's going on out there now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's Stein?\" countered Jonner. \"I want to talk to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's not feeling so good. Said he'd rather not try to get back up to\r\nthe control room right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him to come to the mike anyhow. I don't want to talk to you till\r\nI talk to Stein.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stein can't talk, I tell you. If you don't want to talk to me, then\r\nare you ready to come in?\"\r\n\r\n\"And get shot?\" retorted Jonner.\r\n\r\nSo Jonner's suspicions were that definite. It was to be expected after\r\nthe words Stein had been able to shout into the microphone. Jonner was\r\nnobody's dumbbell.\r\n\r\nKraag tired once more.\r\n\r\n\"That's a ridiculous idea, Jonner,\" he said. \"I can't figure why you'd\r\nsay such a thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shot Stein,\" said Jonner positively. \"There's no use your denying\r\nit. I know you shot Stein, and I'll know it until Stein himself tells\r\nme it isn't so.\"\r\n\r\nKraag knew Jonner too well to try to keep up the pretense any longer.\r\nHe tried another tack.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, so I shot Stein,\" he admitted. \"That doesn't mean I'll shoot\r\nyou. Come on in and talk it over. We can make a deal.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you shot Stein, why wouldn't you shoot me?\" asked Jonner logically.\r\n\r\n\"There wasn't enough air for three. There is for two.\"\r\n\r\nJonner was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"So that's why you did it,\" he said then. \"Figured it pretty close,\r\ndidn't you, Kraag?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm the guy who has to watch supplies on this boat. I checked the\r\noxygen after the crash broke open those three compartments on the\r\nsupply deck. There's 3800 pounds of oxygen left. It'll take about 22\r\nmonths for the rescue ship to get here from Mars. At 2.8 pounds of\r\noxygen a day, you and I can make it, but it would have lasted the three\r\nof us only 15 months.\"\r\n\r\nJonner cursed him for a full minute, not loudly but with such intensity\r\nthat Kraag felt his face getting warm.\r\n\r\n\"You damn murderer!\" finished Jonner. \"You damn cold-blooded murderer!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cut it out, Jonner,\" growled Kraag. \"I can't understand you and Stein.\r\nWhat were you expecting to save us? A miracle?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't feel like talking about it now,\" said Jonner warily. \"If you\r\nhad only ... Hell, Kraag, we'd been together a long time. Even if all\r\nof us had thought we were going to die, I didn't think we'd kill each\r\nother off like animals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Self-preservation is the first law of nature,\" said Kraag cynically.\r\n\"Better that two should die than three. Come on in, Jonner.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's self-preservation? No thanks, Kraag. You know I'll turn you in\r\nas a murderer when the rescue ship gets here. I have no hankering to\r\nwalk up where you can burn me down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, stay out there till your air gives out.\"\r\n\r\nThe airlock was not a comfortable place to spend one of the asteroid's\r\nseven-hour nights, but Kraag was afraid not to stand guard there with\r\nhis heat-gun. He was afraid to sleep, too, for the airlock combination\r\nwas virtually noiseless and Jonner could open it from the outside.\r\nJonner was unarmed, but Kraag had no hankering for a hand-to-hand fight\r\nwith the powerfully built captain inside the personnel sphere. Because\r\nthe air would swish out of the lock instantly if Jonner opened it,\r\nKraag had to wear a spacesuit.\r\n\r\nHe tried to talk to Jonner several times, but got no answer. Toward\r\ndawn, Kraag dozed off, only to be brought awake with a start by\r\nJonner's voice in his earphones.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Kraag,\" said Jonner. There was iron in his voice. \"Have\r\na good night's sleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"About as good as yours, I'd say,\" retorted Kraag, wishing he could get\r\nhis hands inside his helmet to rub his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I slept fine. Found me a good foxhole just beyond the horizon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn you, Jonner! Where are you now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on and have breakfast, Kraag. I'm far enough away for you to see\r\nme. Take a look.\"\r\n\r\nKraag peered out of the uppermost airlock ports, one by one. They\r\nslanted at a bad angle, but through one of them he made out Jonner,\r\nstanding half a mile away. Uncannily, as though he could see Kraag's\r\nhelmet at the port, Jonner waved.\r\n\r\nKraag was afraid to take off the spacesuit now because the supply deck\r\nhad no ports and Jonner could get to the ship in a hurry if he wanted\r\nto. He took off the helmet, though, and went up to the center deck.\r\nHurriedly, he opened the cover of the port in the direction he had seen\r\nJonner. Jonner was still in the same place, sitting down.\r\n\r\nKraag heated breakfast and ate it with an eye on the port. Jonner\r\ndidn't move. Kraag felt better when he had eaten, and went up to the\r\ncontrol room.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you give it up and come on in, Jonner?\" he asked. \"The\r\noxygen in that suit's not good for more than another 15 hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's where you're wrong, Kraag, and that's what's so tragic about\r\nyour murdering Stein,\" said Jonner quietly. \"You either forgot that we\r\ncarried oxygen instead of nitric acid as the fuel oxidizer this trip\r\nor, being an engineer, you didn't think of it except as fuel.\r\n\r\n\"There's enough oxygen in the tanks scattered over the landscape to\r\nkeep a dozen men alive until the rescue ship gets here. It's hard for\r\nme to get at, but I've already found I can manage it.\"\r\n\r\nKraag was profoundly shocked. For a moment the enormity of what he had\r\ndone in killing Stein almost overwhelmed him. It had been completely\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nThen his self-reproach turned into a growing anger against Jonner.\r\nJonner was always so reticent, always required his orders to be obeyed\r\nwithout explanation. During the whole argument about taking an orbit\r\naround the asteroid, during the whole time it had taken to spiral down\r\nto a crash, he had not told Kraag how he expected them to stay alive\r\nuntil they were rescued.\r\n\r\nKraag hadn't asked him, of course. Kraag had assumed Jonner was\r\nthinking in terms of his own figures.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry about Stein,\" said Kraag, and meant it. \"But it can't be\r\nhelped now, Jonner. There's enough air for both of us, if you'll keep\r\nyour mouth shut when the rescue ship gets here.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I promised, I still wouldn't trust you and you wouldn't trust me.\r\nNo, Kraag. The only way it'll work is for you to come out unarmed and\r\nlet me go in and get the guns. Then I'll lock you in the control room\r\ntill the rescue ship gets here.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of us is a fool, Jonner, and you seem to think it's me. I'm not\r\ngoing to burn for murder. I've got the whip hand. You may have oxygen,\r\nbut you've got to have food and water, too.\"\r\n\r\nJonner laughed, without humor.\r\n\r\n\"I've got enough of that for three Earth days and I can last longer,\"\r\nhe said. \"Before that time, I'll come and get you, Kraag. Don't go to\r\nsleep!\"\r\n\r\nKraag cursed and switched off the loudspeaker. But he kept an eye on\r\nJonner through the glassite. Always, he had to watch Jonner--or stay on\r\nguard in the airlock.\r\n\r\nIf there were only some way to lock Jonner out! But the only real lock\r\nwas on the control room, and a man couldn't live in the control room\r\nwith an enemy below who could cut the water and oxygen lines.\r\n\r\nKraag would have to sleep some time. Jonner couldn't know when, but\r\nJonner already was seven hours sleep up on him. Jonner could pick his\r\nown time to slip up to the sphere under cover of darkness, he could\r\npick his own time to come through the lock. Maybe Kraag would be awake\r\nand could burn him down--but maybe not.\r\n\r\nThere was only one thing to do. He'd have to take the attack to Jonner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStill watching Jonner through every port he passed, always watching\r\nJonner, Kraag hung a heat-gun on one of the hooks at his spacesuit's\r\nbelt. He went back below, put the helmet on, and went out through the\r\nairlock.\r\n\r\nThe shadow of the sphere stretched away toward his left. He was in\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nJonner, still in the same spot, got to his feet but made no move to\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome to the great outdoors,\" said Jonner.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to get you, Jonner,\" said Kraag grimly. \"One way or another,\r\nI'm going to get you.\"\r\n\r\nHe moved toward Jonner. Each step was a long, floating leap and it was\r\nhard to stay balanced before landing. Jonner moved, not away from him\r\nbut sidewise.\r\n\r\nKraag stopped. The effective range of the heat-gun was no more than 100\r\nfeet. If he tried to get close enough to Jonner to use it, Jonner could\r\ncircle and get to the personnel sphere.\r\n\r\nThere were the oxygen tanks, the big ones used for fuel. If Kraag could\r\nget to them and burn them open, Jonner couldn't last long outside. But\r\nthey were scattered pretty far from the personnel sphere. Jonner would\r\nget to the sphere for sure if he tried that.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, Jonner, I know when I'm licked,\" said Kraag. \"Come on in.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not too far away to see the gun, Kraag.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take it back to the sphere and leave it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not just toss it away?\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you beat me to it and get the drop on me? We'll leave the\r\nguns in the sphere and I'll meet you on even terms.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll believe it when I see it.\"\r\n\r\nKraag went back to the sphere. He couldn't stand in shadow without\r\nlooking suspicious, but he took the heat-gun from his belt\r\nostentatiously and swung it in an arc, apparently tossing it through\r\nthe open outer lock. Instead, he held onto it and hung it by the\r\ntrigger guard to a belt hook at the back of his suit.\r\n\r\n\"I'm all clean, Jonner. Come on up,\" he invited.\r\n\r\n\"Let's see the hooks, Kraag,\" said Jonner.\r\n\r\nKraag held his arms aloft, wriggling the empty steel fingers of the\r\nspacesuit. Jonner came toward him, floating high above the surface with\r\neach step. At just about the extreme range of the heat-gun, he stopped.\r\nKraag kept his arms outspread, but tensed himself.\r\n\r\n\"Clean, so far,\" said Jonner drily. \"Now turn around, Kraag.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you jump me from behind? Not hardly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gun on the back hook, eh, Kraag?\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn you, Jonner!\" Kraag reached behind him for the gun and at the\r\nsame time leaped toward Jonner. Jonner, ready, jumped back, and Jonner\r\nwas a more powerful man. Handling a heat-gun with the hand-hooks of a\r\nspacesuit is awkward business, and by the time Kraag could bring the\r\nweapon to bear on Jonner and press the trigger, Jonner's distance was\r\nsuch that the ray obviously did no worse than make things uncomfortably\r\nwarm for him.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think that surrender rang true,\" commented Jonner. \"If you'd\r\nbeen level, you'd have tossed away the heat-gun.\"\r\n\r\nThen Jonner revealed that he was not entirely weaponless. As he hit the\r\nsurface, his arm moved in an arc and a good-sized rock came hurtling\r\nthrough space toward Kraag.\r\n\r\nKraag writhed frantically, two feet off the ground, and the stone\r\nmissed him by inches. Kraag landed on his side and bounced again.\r\nJonner hit once more and hurled another rock. Evidently he was armed\r\nwith several of them. This one ricocheted off the ground near Kraag\r\njust as Kraag finally slid to rest.\r\n\r\nGetting to his feet and turning to flee was agonizingly slow, when\r\nevery frantic movement lifted him off the ground. Another stone came\r\nsailing by, to strike the personnel sphere and rebound at an angle,\r\nbefore Kraag could jump back, away from Jonner.\r\n\r\nPerspiring and panting, he clambered hastily back into the safety of\r\nthe airlock.\r\n\r\nJonner's rocks were a better weapon than a heat-gun, Kraag realized.\r\nThey weighed only a fraction of an ounce and Jonner could fling them\r\nan amazing distance. But their mass was just the same as ever, and a\r\njagged one could rip a fatal hole in a spacesuit. He had no intention\r\nof engaging in a stone-throwing duel with Jonner, in which Jonner would\r\nbe at least on equal terms with him.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was even more imperative than before that he\r\neliminate Jonner as soon as possible. A rock could be a deadly weapon\r\nif Jonner got inside the sphere, too.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, there was no point in concealing Stein's body from\r\nJonner any longer and Kraag couldn't take chances on it polluting\r\nthe atmosphere of the sphere. He dragged the corpse from the food\r\ncompartment, down to the airlock, and pushed it out onto the surface of\r\nCeres. The body settled stiffly to the ground a few feet away.\r\n\r\nKraag removed his helmet and hand-hooks, went back up to the control\r\nroom and settled himself to watch Jonner. Jonner walked around freely,\r\nperiodically hurling rocks at the sphere. The rocks bounced off without\r\ndamage, but every time one of them hit the hull, the sound of it rang\r\nthrough the sphere.\r\n\r\nKraag switched on the communications system.\r\n\r\n\"Do you have to do that?\" he demanded in irritation. \"It's not doing\r\nyou any good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keeping me in practice,\" replied Jonner cheerfully. \"I developed a\r\npretty good arm throwing grenades in the Charax Uprising.\"\r\n\r\nJonner was a veteran of that brief but savage war on Mars, and\r\nsometimes reminisced about it. It was there he had developed his\r\npreference for the old-style projectile pistol over the heat-gun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKraag's eyes lingered on Jonner's pistol, hanging in the rack with the\r\nheat-guns, and slowly an idea spread through his mind. The heat-gun\r\nrange was the same anywhere, but the range of a projectile weapon\r\nshould be greater here than on Mars or Earth. Its range should be far\r\ngreater than Jonner's rocks.\r\n\r\nKraag took it from the rack and turned it over in his hand, studying\r\nit. He wasn't sure of its principle, but thought it was something on\r\nthe order of rocket fuel. It should fire without an atmosphere around\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere were some figures stamped on the barrel: \"COLT 1985, Cal-.45,\r\nMV-1100, Ser-45617298.\" Kraag puzzled over them. He knew the first\r\none was the make and year and the last undoubtedly was the serial\r\nnumber. He deduced that \"MV-1100\" probably was a figure showing the\r\nrelationship between the projectile's mass and velocity. But it had\r\nbeen a long time since projectile weapons were common.\r\n\r\nHe called on the memory of a demonstration of the weapon Jonner had\r\ngiven his companions once on Mars. There was something that had to be\r\ndone to prepare it for firing. Holding it in his right hand, Kraag\r\ngrasped the barrel with his left. After a moment of hesitant tugging,\r\nhe hit the right movement and the whole outer casing of the barrel slid\r\nbackward and clicked. It snapped back into position as Kraag released\r\nit, and he remembered.\r\n\r\nThe gun was primed now. All he had to do was press the trigger and it\r\nwould fire. It would automatically prime itself again after firing. It\r\nwould fire each time he pressed the trigger now, until it exhausted its\r\nprojectiles.\r\n\r\nExultant, he laid it carefully in a contour chair, where it wouldn't\r\nslide out. He put his helmet back on and replaced the hand-hooks of his\r\nspacesuit.\r\n\r\nHe looked out several ports before he found Jonner. The captain was not\r\nmore than 150 feet away, casually lobbing rocks at the sphere.\r\n\r\nKraag picked up Jonner's pistol and made his way down to the airlock.\r\nHe emerged and walked around the sphere to the side where he had\r\nlocated Jonner.\r\n\r\nJonner was moving away now, though he couldn't have known Kraag was\r\ncoming out. He was about 300 feet away--too far for a heat-gun, but\r\ncertainly within range of the projectile weapon. He seemed to be headed\r\ntoward one of the big fuel tanks.\r\n\r\nKraag levelled the pistol toward Jonner and pulled the trigger. To his\r\nastonishment, he was hurtled backward, heels over head.\r\n\r\nThe kick of a .45 on an asteroid is pretty powerful. Kraag must have\r\nbounced 50 feet backward over the terrain before he slid to rest on his\r\nstomach. But he held on to the pistol--and, since he never had a chance\r\nto release the pressure of his hand-hook on the trigger, it did not\r\nfire again.\r\n\r\nWhen he struggled upright, Jonner was standing at the edge of the fuel\r\ntank, watching him.\r\n\r\n\"Using my gun now, eh, Kraag?\" Jonner said. \"You'd better stick to\r\nweapons you know something about.\"\r\n\r\nWith that, he disappeared behind the fuel tank.\r\n\r\nKraag got to his feet and advanced confidently. His heat-gun was still\r\nhanging at his belt if he got close enough to Jonner to use it, and\r\nhe could fire the projectile weapon at Jonner when Jonner was out of\r\nheat-gun range.\r\n\r\nHe was learning. One had to point the projectile gun accurately before\r\nfiring. It couldn't be swung around and focused while pressing the\r\ntrigger, like a heat-gun. He might miss a few times, but he ought to be\r\nable to hit Jonner at least once before the ammunition was exhausted.\r\nOnce should be enough.\r\n\r\nHeat-gun ready in his left hand, projectile gun in his right, Kraag\r\ncircled the fuel tank. Keeping it between them, Jonner had headed\r\nstraight for the horizon, running in long, shallow leaps. He was at\r\nleast half a mile away.\r\n\r\nKraag pointed the projectile pistol and pulled the trigger. Nothing\r\nhappened. Then he realized that he had never released the pressure of\r\nhis hand-hook on the trigger after firing the first time. He let up on\r\nit and pressed it down.\r\n\r\nAnd again Kraag was hurled backward, but this time he was smashed\r\nagainst the fuel tank and rebounded forward, falling on his face.\r\nBy the time he reached his feet again, Jonner had vanished over the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nCursing softly, Kraag made his way back to the personnel sphere. He had\r\nhoped to get Jonner with that shot. He was very sleepy, and now he was\r\nfaced with another night on guard.\r\n\r\nHe entered the airlock, pushed himself gently upward to catch the rungs\r\nof the metal ladder and turned the wheel of the airlock's inner door.\r\n\r\nNothing happened. The door did not open.\r\n\r\nFear gripped him like a paralyzing hand. For a moment he thought Jonner\r\nhad managed to get to the sphere ahead of him and somehow had locked\r\nhim out. But that was impossible. Then he thought the inner door might\r\nbe jammed, and he and Jonner locked out together.\r\n\r\nHe glanced frantically below him, then broke into relieved laughter. He\r\nhad left the outer airlock door open. As a safety measure against the\r\nsphere's accidentally losing its air, neither door would open unless\r\nthe other was shut.\r\n\r\nAnd that meant he could lock Jonner out of the sphere simply by leaving\r\nthe inner door of the airlock open!\r\n\r\nHis laugh was full and genuine now as he pulled the outer door closed.\r\n\r\n\"Having fun, Kraag?\" asked Jonner in his earphones.\r\n\r\n\"Just looking forward to a good night's sleep, for a change,\" retorted\r\nKraag triumphantly. \"Prowl around all you want to, Jonner. I can wait\r\nyou out, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"The airlock, eh? I wondered when your guilty conscience would\r\nsettle down and let you remember about that airlock,\" said Jonner\r\nphlegmatically. \"You know, Kraag, I had no idea you wouldn't think\r\nabout a simple thing like that, till I looked through the airlock port\r\nlast night and saw you huddled up there with a heat-gun. You should\r\nhave turned out the light.\"\r\n\r\nJonner was silent for a few minutes. Then he added:\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I'd laugh yet, though, Kraag. Remember, you're fighting\r\nwith my weapons.\"\r\n\r\nKraag wasn't sure what he meant by that: whether he was talking about\r\nKraag's using the projectile pistol or the fact that they were in\r\nspace, Jonner's natural element. Kraag himself had been in space 10\r\nyears, most of it with Jonner, but before then he had never left\r\nEarth. Jonner had been born and raised on Mars, where a man needed a\r\nsuit to go to the next settlement, and he had been on a ship since he\r\nwas 15.\r\n\r\nAs for using the pistol, Kraag could see danger for no one but Jonner.\r\nHe had proved, twice, that he could fire it. He was quite sure the\r\nold-fashioned weapon was no more likely to explode than a heat-gun. The\r\nonly trouble he foresaw was figuring how to reload it if he used up all\r\nits projectiles before hitting Jonner.\r\n\r\nKraag shrugged and removed his suit. He was hungry, and he was\r\nlooking forward to a supper better than Jonner had available in the\r\nconcentrated supplies in his spacesuit. Jonner's food and water by now\r\nhad dwindled to less than 60 hours' supply, unless he was weakening\r\nhimself by going on slim rations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs he wolfed down his supper, Kraag took stock of his situation. He\r\ncould see no flaw in his position. All he had to do was sit back and\r\nwait.\r\n\r\nHe decided not to destroy the tanks that were Jonner's supply of extra\r\noxygen. After all, Jonner could not last beyond his food and water\r\nsupply. The presence of the oxygen made his case airtight. He could\r\ndispose of the bodies of Stein and Jonner and tell the crew of the\r\nrescue ship they had wandered off on an exploration tour and never\r\nreturned. With plenty of oxygen for the three of them, no motive could\r\nbe established against him for the murders.\r\n\r\nHe began to feel rather sorry for Jonner. They had been companions,\r\nand Stein with them, for a long time.\r\n\r\nAfter eating, he went up to the control room and turned Jonner in on\r\nthe communications system. He was genuinely regretful that Jonner had\r\nto die so soon. It would be lonesome on the asteroid with no one to\r\ntalk to.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you've been keeping the radio open to Marsport, in case there\r\nwere any inquiries,\" said Jonner. \"If they get the idea we're all dead\r\nout here, they may call off the rescue.\"\r\n\r\n\"The last time they called was right after you left the ship,\" said\r\nKraag. \"Stein was going to tell you, but I suppose he forgot it.\r\nMarsport knows where we are. A rescue ship should have blasted off by\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the advantage of being on Ceres instead of in space,\" Jonner\r\npointed out. \"They know Ceres' orbit, but they'd have to have several\r\ndirectional fixes on us, spaced several days apart, to pinpoint us if\r\nthe ship were in space. What did Stein say the escape velocity here is?\"\r\n\r\nSurprised at the unexpected question, Kraag consulted the notes Stein\r\nhad left lying in the control room.\r\n\r\n\"EV 1,552.41 feet per second,\" he replied. \"Not figuring on jumping off\r\nthe planet, are you, Jonner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" said Jonner.\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't wake me up if you do. I'm really going to pound the pillow\r\ntonight.\"\r\n\r\nJonner laughed shortly, and Kraag heard the click as the captain\r\nswitched off his helmet radio. He grinned.\r\n\r\nKraag was asleep almost as soon as he hit the bunk.\r\n\r\nHe came awake slowly, reluctantly, knowing he had not had all the sleep\r\nhe needed. Something was pounding noisily somewhere, ringing through\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head to clear it. For just an instant there was silence in\r\nthe utter darkness. Then:\r\n\r\nCRASH!\r\n\r\nLike a clap of thunder the noise reverberated through the metal hull of\r\nthe sphere.\r\n\r\nKraag started violently, and only the bunk straps kept him from\r\nrocketing to the ceiling. Again:\r\n\r\nCRASH!\r\n\r\nAnd Kraag could feel the sphere shiver with the blow.\r\n\r\nHe switched on the lights just as another terrific crash sounded. This\r\ntime he could see everything on the central deck quiver with the impact.\r\n\r\nOne of the four small ports around the central deck was uncovered,\r\nand the light threw a beam out into the black night of the asteroid.\r\nIt brought a temporary cessation of the regular blows. During the\r\ninterval, Kraag unstrapped himself and tumbled up to the control room,\r\nto switch on the communications system.\r\n\r\n\"Jonner!\" he shouted. \"Jonner, what in hell?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not deaf,\" said the loudspeaker resentfully. \"Give me a chance to\r\nturn down my volume, if you're going to holler.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the devil are you doing out there, Jonner?\"\r\n\r\n\"What I promised you. I'm coming in after you.\"\r\n\r\nKraag swore.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to blow you off the damned planet,\" he threatened, and\r\nleaped for the gun rack.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to come outside to do it,\" reminded Jonner. \"If you try to\r\nshoot through the ports, you'll save me a lot of work.\"\r\n\r\nKraag raced up and down the sphere twice before he had sense enough\r\nto turn out all the lights and use the searchlight. Then he located\r\nJonner, clinging to the sphere outside the astrodome on the navigation\r\ndeck. Jonner had a sledge hammer from the ship's cargo section in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nJonner grinned at him and moved quickly out of the searchlight's beam.\r\nTen seconds later, another thunderous crash sounded, apparently from\r\nthe other side of the sphere. Kraag swung the light in a circle, but\r\nJonner could move faster than the beam.\r\n\r\nHastily, Kraag made another tour of the sphere, this time closing all\r\nthe metal covers over the ports. When he reached the control room,\r\nJonner's voice was calling him over the loudspeaker, repeating his name\r\nevery few seconds.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" demanded Kraag, panting.\r\n\r\n\"Just wanted to tell you I could have knocked out the astrodome or one\r\nof the ports before you woke up,\" said Jonner cheerfully. \"I don't want\r\nto kill you, Kraag. I just want you to surrender, and if you don't I\r\ncan eventually batter through the meteor shield and the hull, and ruin\r\nthe sphere for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see about that,\" gritted Kraag. Hurriedly he donned a spacesuit.\r\nHanging Jonner's pistol at his belt, he took a heat-gun in his right\r\nhand and a flashlight in his left and ventured out through the\r\nairlock. He did not make the mistake of switching on the airlock light,\r\nbut Jonner seemed to know when he emerged, possibly from the vibration\r\nwhen the lock opened.\r\n\r\n\"Nice night out, isn't it, Kraag?\" Jonner welcomed him.\r\n\r\nKraag grunted. The night was black as pitch. The only way he could tell\r\nwhere the ground ended and the sky began was that the sky was jewelled\r\nwith stars.\r\n\r\nHe turned the light on and flashed it over the sphere. No sign of\r\nJonner. But a rock struck his helmet and bounced off with a clang that\r\nnearly knocked him down and left him momentarily dizzy.\r\n\r\n\"I'm behind you, Kraag,\" said Jonner pleasantly. \"Better go back\r\ninside. I promise not to break your shell open tonight.\"\r\n\r\nKraag twisted around and fired the heat-gun even as he searched for\r\nJonner with the flashlight. Both beams pierced emptiness. Jonner just\r\nlaughed at him.\r\n\r\nAfraid now that Jonner would get into the sphere, Kraag scuttled back\r\naround to the airlock. Heat-gun ready, he turned on the light before\r\nclosing the outer door, and breathed a sigh of relief at finding it\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nTrembling with reaction, he closed the outer lock, left the inner one\r\nopen and made his way up to the center deck. He needed coffee.\r\n\r\n\"I see you've gone back to the heat-gun,\" said Jonner. \"That's smart.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd like to see me exhaust the fuel tank of your pistol shooting it\r\nin the dark, when I can't hit you, wouldn't you?\" retorted Kraag. \"No,\r\nthanks. I'll keep it for long distances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fuel tank? Oh, you mean the magazine.\" Jonner laughed. \"I'd stay away\r\nfrom that old .45 of mine if I were you, Kraag. It's been with me too\r\nlong. It's a lot more likely to turn on my enemies than to do me any\r\nharm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rot!\" snapped Kraag. \"It's a gun. All I have to do is get the hang of\r\naiming it properly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't use too much power tonight, either,\" warned Jonner. \"You\r\ndon't get much with the solar mirror this far out. Anyhow, I took the\r\nmirror off while you were having your nap. The batteries should give\r\nout in a few hours.\"\r\n\r\nWithout answering, Kraag switched off his radio and removed his\r\nhelmet. That last bit of information was a blow. Gradually, Jonner was\r\nstripping Kraag down to his own subsistence level.\r\n\r\nPower or not, Kraag was determined to have his coffee. But first he\r\nwent over the sphere again and switched off all unnecessary lights.\r\n\r\nJonner was a man who kept his word, but Kraag couldn't afford to trust\r\nhim. Jonner might change his mind and try to break open the sphere\r\nagain before morning. Kraag kept his spacesuit on. He did not sleep too\r\nwell, for about once every 30 or 40 minutes something--either a large\r\nrock or Jonner's sledge hammer--would strike the sphere a resounding\r\nblow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Kraag's watch told him it was morning, he opened the ports of the\r\ncenter deck and let the weak sunlight stream into the sphere. Off to\r\nthe east, he saw Jonner digging with a pick from the cargo. Jonner was\r\nfar enough away for his legs from the knees down to be hidden by the\r\nextreme curvature of the little planet.\r\n\r\nKraag's first impulse was to go out and take a pot shot at him.\r\nInstead, he switched on the short-wave cooker and prepared some\r\nbreakfast. Taking it up to the control room, where he could switch\r\non the communications system, he opened the eastern port and watched\r\nJonner. This high, he could see Jonner's feet and the hole he was\r\ndigging--and Stein's body.\r\n\r\nJonner had taken Stein's body from the spot outside the sphere where\r\nKraag had pushed it. He was burying Stein.\r\n\r\nJonner finished his excavation and laid Stein gently to rest in it. He\r\npushed rocks back in to fill it up, and wrested a boulder that would\r\nhave weighed a ton over it for a monument. Then he murmured a brief\r\nprayer over the grave.\r\n\r\nKraag was ashamed and then, unaccountably, angry. But he stood at the\r\nport, drinking his coffee and watching Jonner, and said nothing.\r\n\r\nEither with chalk or with some soft rock he had found--Kraag could not\r\ntell which--Jonner wrote something on the big stone that was Stein's\r\nmonument. Then he stood up and turned toward the sphere.\r\n\r\n\"Kraag,\" he said. \"Kraag, are you tuned in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Kraag shortly.\r\n\r\n\"You have today to surrender. Tonight I'm going to hatch you out of\r\nyour comfortable egg.\"\r\n\r\nKraag switched off the communications system and paced the room, anger\r\nburning slowly inside him. This was ridiculous. He held all the cards.\r\nHe had the guns, he had the sphere. Jonner was outside, weaponless,\r\nwith a limited supply of food and water. Yet Jonner had him on the\r\ndefensive.\r\n\r\nHow had it happened? How could it happen? Kraag lit a cigarette and\r\npuffed at it slowly, applying his mind coldly to the situation.\r\n\r\nHe didn't doubt that Jonner would do as he threatened, but he didn't\r\nthink it was the recklessness of desperation. More likely, Jonner\r\ndeliberately, calculatingly, planned to reduce his own chances for\r\ncomfort, in order to bring Kraag down to more even terms with him.\r\n\r\nIf Jonner broke the hull of the sphere, it could be repaired--by\r\nsomeone working outside, free from interruption by an enemy. Until it\r\nwas repaired, it would mean that Kraag, too, would have to live in\r\na spacesuit. And Jonner might knock open a hole, or more than one,\r\nbig enough to permit him to enter the sphere and attack Kraag in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nIf only he could surround the sphere with light at night, he could keep\r\nJonner at a distance. But with the solar mirror gone, the searchlight,\r\non top of the sphere's other electrical requirements, would discharge\r\nthe batteries before the night was half gone.\r\n\r\nKraag knew Jonner's stubbornness, his resourcefulness, his raw courage.\r\nJonner was the one of them who was really at bay, when you considered\r\nit. Yet Kraag felt that Jonner was closing in on him, gradually,\r\ninexorably.\r\n\r\nFacing this, Kraag felt the steel enter his own will. He wasn't a\r\ncoward. He had just been expecting this to be too easy. If Jonner would\r\nforce him to fight, he would fight. He still had the advantage.\r\n\r\nHe must abandon the sphere as an asset. Jonner could take that away\r\nfrom him anyhow. On the other hand, if Jonner took over the sphere,\r\nKraag could use the same weapon against him. He could break open the\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nSo the sphere was no longer a factor. The food and water were no longer\r\na factor, for food and water went with the sphere. He would admit\r\nJonner to equality in those supplies--not full equality, for he could\r\nprovision himself now more fully than Jonner had been provisioned two\r\nCeres days earlier. He still might pin Jonner down as Jonner tried to\r\nget to the sphere for more supplies.\r\n\r\nThen Kraag's remaining advantage lay in the guns. They should be\r\nenough. If he could get close enough to use a heat-gun, he could\r\nblast Jonner. Jonner's own projectile weapon would keep Jonner out of\r\nrock-throwing range, and sooner or later he would hit Jonner with it.\r\nHe couldn't keep on missing; the law of average would give him a hit\r\nsooner or later. And all he needed was just one....\r\n\r\nKraag provisioned his spacesuit and hung all three of the heat-guns\r\nat his belt. In one of the capacious outside pockets he put two spare\r\nflashlights and half a dozen of the extra fuel packets--What was it\r\nJonner had called them? Magazines, that was it--for Jonner's projectile\r\npistol. He took that pistol in his right hand and sallied forth to do\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJonner was nowhere in sight. Kraag shut the outer lock to make it\r\nappear he might be still in the sphere if Jonner happened not to spot\r\nhim. He went over to Stein's new grave.\r\n\r\nJonner had written on the stone: REST IN PEACE. R. STEIN MURDERED BY A.\r\nKRAAG. DEC. 12, 2057.\r\n\r\nAngrily, Kraag burned the lettering off in a 30-second blast with his\r\nheat-gun that left the face of Stein's gravestone cherry red.\r\n\r\nHe turned to survey the terrain, and saw Jonner. The captain was\r\ncrouched half a mile away, apparently writing more on a flat rock or on\r\nthe ground itself.\r\n\r\nJonner was facing him, but his head was down and he hadn't seen Kraag.\r\nIf Kraag fired the projectile pistol, he probably would miss and might\r\nwarn Jonner with the shot. He was sure of his accuracy with a heat-gun.\r\nKraag took a heat-gun in his left hand and ran toward Jonner.\r\n\r\nPossibly the vibration of the ground warned Jonner. He looked up,\r\njumped to his feet and fled. As soon as he could stop and get his feet\r\nplanted firmly on the ground, Kraag fired the projectile pistol after\r\nhim. He was still shooting low and to one side.\r\n\r\nKraag picked himself up from the ground, where the backlash of the\r\nweapon had knocked him, and went up to the spot where Jonner had been\r\nwriting. A mathematical problem had been scratched on the surface with\r\na sharp rock. Kraag had interrupted Jonner in the middle of it.\r\n\r\nThe figures that had been written were:\r\n\r\n             11\r\n          ------\r\n   1.141 ) 1552.41\r\n           141\r\n           ---\r\n            142\r\n            141\r\n            ---\r\n              1\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: figures are long division of 1552.41 divided by\r\n1.141]\r\n\r\nKraag stared at it, carrying out the rest of the simple mathematics in\r\nhis head. The answer was 1101. But what was the problem?\r\n\r\nThe figure \"1.41\" was familiar enough. It was the square root of two,\r\ncarried to two decimal places. But what was Jonner dividing by it, and\r\nwhy?\r\n\r\nHe frowned in concentration. There was something familiar about the\r\nnumbers, something that had to do with him and Jonner, and Jonner\r\nwouldn't be working arithmetic just for amusement.\r\n\r\nHe saw Jonner moving on the horizon, just his head visible against\r\nthe black sky, his body hidden by the curve of the planet. Jonner was\r\ncircling.\r\n\r\nThe sudden realization of danger wiped other thoughts from his mind.\r\nUntil he saw the epitaph Jonner had written for Stein, Kraag had\r\nthought Jonner looked at this as he did: one man against the other, and\r\nwinner take all. But Jonner intended to win even if he lost, because\r\nJonner was not fighting just for Jonner's survival but for due process\r\nof law.\r\n\r\nJonner was trying to make certain that, even if Kraag killed him,\r\nMartian law would punish Kraag for Stein's death. And if Jonner got\r\ninto the sphere, he could get his message to Marsport or the rescue\r\nship simply by turning on the radio.\r\n\r\nKraag turned and raced back to the sphere. He arrived, panting\r\nheavily. Jonner was nowhere in sight, but he knew Jonner, circling,\r\ncould not have gotten there ahead of him.\r\n\r\nHe must kill Jonner before nightfall, if he could, but he must not get\r\nfar enough from the sphere to let Jonner slip in behind him. He was not\r\nready, yet, to destroy the radio to keep Jonner from it.\r\n\r\nHe walked around the sphere. There was Jonner on the other side, only\r\nhis head above the horizon, moving clockwise. The sun flashed and\r\ngleamed from Jonner's helmet.\r\n\r\nThere was no sense in shooting at so small a target as a head. A mile\r\naway, Jonner's whole body was a small enough target. A carefully gauged\r\nleap carried Kraag to the top of the sphere. Here, 40 feet higher, his\r\nrange of view was increased considerably. He could see Jonner well.\r\n\r\nJonner could see him, too. Jonner stopped to hurl a stone. It took a\r\nwhile for the missile to cover the distance. It passed below Kraag's\r\nlevel, some distance away from him.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you give it up, Jonner?\" asked Kraag. \"You can't hurt me\r\nwith a rock, at this distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should I?\" retorted Jonner. \"All I have to do is wait till night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, wait. But I'm not waiting, Jonner. One of us is going to win\r\nthis thing before night, or I'm going to blast the radio so you can't\r\nreach Marsport. If I have to do that, I'll track you down tomorrow--and\r\nI think I can stay outside and fight you away from the sphere tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Getting desperate enough to fight like a man now, aren't you, Kraag?\r\nIf you want a showdown today, I'm willing.\"\r\n\r\nKraag's mind was clear now. He had the situation under control. He\r\nglanced around the landscape at the scattered portions of the wrecked\r\nship. There was the cargo hull, burst open, where Jonner had gotten his\r\nsledge hammer and the pick to bury Stein. Over there was a red sphere,\r\nripped by the jagged gash of the meteor collision--one of the two\r\nhydrazine fuel tanks. The yellow sphere 30 degrees away from it was an\r\noxygen fuel tank.\r\n\r\nKraag leveled Jonner's gun and fired at the yellow sphere. The kick\r\nknocked him off the sphere, but as he somersaulted backwards he saw the\r\nprojectile hit the ground. Still low and to one side. But he noticed\r\nsomething on the gun, he hadn't seen before.\r\n\r\nThere were ridges for sighting along the barrel of Jonner's pistol.\r\nRegaining his position atop the sphere, Kraag pressed his back against\r\nthe observatory dome, to brace himself against the gun's backlash. He\r\naimed carefully at the yellow sphere and fired again.\r\n\r\nThe yellow tank jumped--not from the impact, but from the spout of\r\nfreed, expanding oxygen through the hole the bullet made. It moved\r\nand wobbled about in the weak gravity, like a dying balloon. When it\r\nstopped, Kraag knew he had destroyed half of Jonner's oxygen supply.\r\n\r\n\"Good shot, Kraag,\" congratulated Jonner, with fatalistic irony in his\r\ntone. \"Of course, I'm not as big a target as the tanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Each target in its own time,\" replied Kraag triumphantly, and looked\r\naround for the other yellow sphere.\r\n\r\nHe had been afraid it might be one of the parts that had fallen over\r\nthe horizon, but it wasn't. It was behind him, a little closer than the\r\nfirst. He hit it with one shot.\r\n\r\nNow Jonner had only the oxygen in his spacesuit tanks.\r\n\r\nJonner had made no effort to move farther away. He was still visible\r\non the horizon, from the knees up, moving in a great circle around the\r\npersonnel sphere.\r\n\r\nKraag aimed carefully and fired. He did not know the projectile's\r\nspeed, but certainly it would be much faster than Jonner's rocks. After\r\nhalf a minute had passed, he knew he had missed.\r\n\r\nThere was only one thing to do. He settled himself and fired again,\r\ntrying to lead Jonner slightly. Again he missed.\r\n\r\nMethodically, taking his time, Kraag fired. Jonner walked on\r\nunconcernedly, circling. Kraag tried to fire so the path of his\r\nprojectile would strike at the top of Jonner's strides, for then Jonner\r\nrose several feet into the air and his whole body was visible.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, Jonner would stop and hurl a stone at Kraag. One man was\r\nas inaccurate as the other. Jonner's stones went wide at that distance,\r\nand Kraag obviously had not hit Jonner with a bullet.\r\n\r\nAt last Jonner stopped. He seemed to be fiddling with something\r\nthat was right on the ground, below Kraag's line of vision. Then a\r\ntremendous stone, bigger than Kraag's head, came hurtling toward the\r\nsphere. Kraag ducked instinctively, but the missile passed 10 feet\r\nabove him, still going well.\r\n\r\n\"What in the devil!\" exclaimed Kraag.\r\n\r\n\"A little innovation of mine, to make things more interesting,\"\r\nsaid Jonner. \"In case you ever want to use the idea, I made me a\r\nsuper-slingshot out of two of the jeep inner tubes from the cargo, and\r\na couple of crowbars I could drive into crevices. Fixed it up yesterday\r\nfor bombardment purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThe duel went on.\r\n\r\nThere came the time when the hammer of the pistol clicked on an empty\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\n\"How do you refuel this thing, Jonner?\" asked Kraag pleasantly. The\r\nsun was still high. He could retreat to the interior of the sphere and\r\nfigure it out if he had to.\r\n\r\n\"It's pretty hard to do with spacesuit hooks,\" replied Jonner. \"Be glad\r\nto demonstrate, if you'll toss me the gun.\"\r\n\r\nKraag laughed, a laugh with more triumph in it than humor, because in\r\nhis fumbling he had just hit the button that ejected the magazine. To\r\npush in a fresh one was the matter of a moment.\r\n\r\nHe had hoped Jonner would move in closer when he knew the pistol was\r\nempty, but no such luck. Jonner stayed put.\r\n\r\nKraag's first effort with the new magazine brought no results, for he\r\nhad neglected to prime the weapon by pushing the outer covering back on\r\nthe barrel. He did this, and resumed his methodical firing.\r\n\r\nAs the time wore on, Kraag began to appreciate the difficulties\r\ninvolved in hitting a moving target, even a slowly moving one, when the\r\nmarksman was as inexperienced as he was. The trouble was that, at that\r\ndistance, he could not see where the bullets were striking and had no\r\nway of knowing how wide of his mark he was shooting.\r\n\r\nHe was on the fourth magazine and the sun had passed the meridian\r\nwhen he felt the sphere vibrate faintly and momentarily beneath him.\r\nHe twisted around, alarmed. He could see nothing. It wasn't one of\r\nJonner's rocks, because a big one had just missed.\r\n\r\nHis eye detected a shining streak that stretched a few inches along the\r\ncurve of the sphere's meteor shield, at about the level of his feet. He\r\nbent to examine it. Something had struck it at high speed, a glancing\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nIt couldn't be one of Jonner's rocks. Small meteor?\r\n\r\nA jagged hole suddenly appeared in the observatory dome near him.\r\nKraag moved up and examined it closely. It had been made by some small\r\nobject. Through the glassite he could see a similar hole in the other\r\nside of the dome.\r\n\r\nDid Jonner have some sort of new weapon? He couldn't. Even Jonner\r\nwasn't resourceful enough to invent a high-powered weapon with the\r\ninnocuous cargo they were carrying for the Titan colony.\r\n\r\nSomething struck Kraag a powerful blow in the left chest, a blow that\r\nhurled him sideways, to tumble off the sphere and fall slowly to the\r\nground below. There was a great pain in his chest, and he released his\r\nhand-hooks in agony, so that the pistol fell away from him.\r\n\r\nKraag gasped for breath as he struck the ground and bounced. He coughed\r\nup blood.\r\n\r\nHe fell slowly again, and bounced again. The third time he settled\r\njarringly, prone on his back.\r\n\r\nHe couldn't understand what had happened to him. He pulled his right\r\narm inside the suit with an effort and probed the painful area on his\r\nchest. He felt the hot wetness of flowing blood.\r\n\r\nHe would have to get to the sphere. He tried to move. He couldn't get\r\noff his back. He lay there and writhed in pain.\r\n\r\nJonner's voice was in his ears, saying something.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it would get you,\" Jonner said. \"It was my only chance. But it\r\ngot you at last, Kraag.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come help me, Jonner,\" whimpered Kraag weakly. \"I've been hit by ... I\r\ndon't know. It must have been a meteor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm coming as fast as I can, Kraag, but it was no meteor. It was my\r\ngun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gun?\" repeated Kraag wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"I warned you about that gun of mine, Kraag. If you'd looked at the\r\nfigures on the barrel, the muzzle velocity of those .45-calibre bullets\r\nis 1100 feet a second. With Ceres' escape velocity, that's almost\r\nexactly the circular velocity at the asteroid's surface.\"\r\n\r\nJonner was standing over him, and then was lifting him gently, to\r\ncarry him to the sphere.\r\n\r\n\"I deliberately got just out of your range of vision, from the ground,\r\nso you'd climb to a high spot,\" said Jonner. \"You had to be high, so\r\nthe bullet would clear the irregularities on the planet's surface, and\r\nI knew that sooner or later you'd shoot a bullet or two high enough not\r\nto hit the ground.\r\n\r\n\"When you were firing at me, your bullets weren't describing a\r\ntrajectory and falling to the surface, as they would on Earth or Mars.\r\nThey were taking an orbit that brought them all the way around the\r\nplanet to the same spot, to hit you from the other side two hours\r\nlater.\"\r\n\r\nKraag tried to look up at him. Something was going wrong with his\r\nsight, and everything outside his face plate was a blur. Must be the\r\noxygen ... maybe his suit didn't seal the bullet hole properly.\r\n\r\n\"I thought....\" Kraag began, and choked. He coughed, slowly and\r\npainfully, then tried again: \"I thought that ... problem on the\r\nrocks ... looked familiar.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've always done it with a slide rule. That's probably why the\r\nlong division didn't register,\" said Jonner. \"The equation is one\r\nevery spaceman knows: the circular velocity equals the escape velocity\r\ndivided by the square root of two.\"",
