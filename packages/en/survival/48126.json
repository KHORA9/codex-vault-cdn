similar area has recorded a more\r\ncomplete or a more interesting resume of the earth’s history than has\r\nthe high plateau country of northern Arizona and southern Utah. Although\r\nmany great events and some long intervals of time are not represented by\r\nthe formations of this region, yet of the five major chapters or eras\r\ninto which all of time has been divided by geologists, at least some\r\nparts of each have left their traces in this area.\r\n\r\nWhether on the brink of the mighty Grand Canyon, among beautiful logs of\r\nthe Petrified Forest, or beneath the lofty walls of Zion—the “Rainbow of\r\nthe Desert”—one looks upon rocks which are not alone curious or\r\ncolorful, but which are also records of the past inscribed and\r\nillustrated in an intensely interesting manner. In one place is seen the\r\nsand of ancient dunes, in another the border of an early sea, or perhaps\r\nthe floodplain of mighty rivers, and in all of these remain the\r\nunmistakable evidences of life—plants and animals preserved to make a\r\nreality of the living, moving past. Everywhere are found the evidences\r\nof those great processes of nature—erosion of the high country, land\r\nformation in the low country, and mighty crustal movements slowly\r\nraising or lowering the land in both.\r\n\r\nFrom the rim of Grand Canyon one not only looks down through tremendous\r\nspace, but also through time, glimpsing the record of vast ages,\r\nmeasurable not in centuries but in millions and even hundreds of\r\nmillions of years. There in the bottom of that mighty chasm are found\r\nrocks formed during the first and oldest era—rocks in which the original\r\nstructure has been entirely modified by great heat and pressure and in\r\nwhich no evidence of life has been found. There in the Grand Canyon are\r\nalso seen two other great series of rocks, those of the second era which\r\nare partially altered and which contain earliest traces of plants, and\r\nthose of the succeeding era in which are preserved primitive animals of\r\nmany types.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORTH-SOUTH CROSS-SECTION OF THE GRAND CANYON REGION;\r\nEAST-WEST CROSS-SECTION OF THE GRAND CANYON REGION]\r\n\r\nRocks of the fourth great era—the age of dinosaurs—lend color to the\r\nPainted Desert, and to the sheer walls of Zion Canyon. Beautiful little\r\nBryce Canyon to the north boasts of some of the most recently formed\r\nrocks in the region—those of the fifth and last era, the age of mammals.\r\nThe great volcanic mountains and the marvelous features of erosion, such\r\nas the canyons and the desert cliffs, are also developments of this most\r\nrecent chapter. In brief, the Grand Canyon region affords some\r\nwonderfully interesting glimpses of ancient landscapes during many\r\ndifferent parts of the earth’s history, and these make the past a\r\nmoving, living thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n                            THE ARCHEAN ERA\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROCKS OF FIRST ERA. INNER GORGE OF GRAND CANYON]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE EARTH’S OLDEST ROCKS\r\n                           (THE ARCHEAN ERA)\r\n\r\nLooking into the depths of Grand Canyon from any point within the Bright\r\nAngel section, one is immediately impressed by the narrow V-shaped gorge\r\ncut in the black rocks at the bottom. This is popularly termed the\r\nGranite or Inner Gorge. Within its walls one is in another world, both\r\nscenically and geologically. Their steep, bare sides, whose surfaces are\r\nchaotic in the extreme, have a history—long and complex. The rocks of\r\nwhich they are formed—some of the oldest known today on the surface of\r\nthe earth—partially tell the story of the first great era in geologic\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nOther rocks of this, the Archean age, are found in the Rockies, in the\r\nAdirondacks of New York, and to a very great extent in eastern Canada.\r\nIn the last named place they contain valuable deposits of iron, nickel,\r\ncobalt, and copper. Rocks which probably also correspond in age occur in\r\nScandinavia, Brazil, China, India, and central Africa.\r\n\r\nAt the Grand Canyon, although we are impressed by the depth of the dark\r\nArchean rocks, beneath the plateau surface approximately a mile, yet we\r\nmarvel even more when we contemplate their great age and the important\r\nseries of events whose history they partially record. Built up\r\noriginally as great horizontal deposits of sand and mud, they were bent\r\nby mighty crustal movements until high mountains, probably comparable to\r\nthe present Alps, were formed. Pressures from the northwest and\r\nsoutheast apparently folded them. The rocks themselves were greatly\r\ncompressed and heated, with the result that complete recrystallization\r\nand the development of a banded structure were brought about. The\r\npresent vertical attitude of these ancient beds, together with their\r\ndense crystalline character, is evidence of the great depth at which\r\nthey were formed and of the extreme pressures to which they were\r\nsubjected. In brief, the rocks that we see today in the Canyon bottom\r\nrepresent merely the roots of once lofty mountains, and the flat surface\r\ncut on these rocks is an old plain that resulted from the wearing down\r\nof high country in this region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLOCK DIAGRAMS OF EVENTS OF FIRST ERA]\r\n\r\n1 Sands and Muds accumulated to form rock strata.\r\n\r\n2 The strata were folded into high mountains. Heat and pressure changed\r\nboth structure and composition of the lower rocks during the folding.\r\n\r\n3 Molten masses were forced up into cracks from below. Upon cooling they\r\nformed lavas on the surface and granites beneath.\r\n\r\n4 During a tremendously long period of time the rivers and rains slowly\r\nwidened the valleys and wore down the ancient mountains to a great plain\r\nnear sea level.\r\n\r\nAs yet no definite traces of either plant or animal life have been found\r\nin rocks of the Archean age in Grand Canyon. Though various forms of\r\nlife may have existed then, and may have been preserved in the original\r\nrocks, their record has since been entirely removed by those extreme\r\npressures which altered even the composition and structure of the rocks\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        GRANITE IN GRAND CANYON\r\n                           (THE ARCHEAN ERA)\r\n\r\nWithin the black, crystalline rocks of the Inner Gorge may be seen many\r\nlarge streaks, bands or irregular masses of a lighter color. From the\r\nCanyon rim these appear white, but from nearby they are usually pink.\r\nThese light colored rocks are granites with a coarse crystalline\r\ntexture.\r\n\r\nGranites derive their name from their granular texture. They are formed\r\nby the slow cooling of molten masses that have been forced into older\r\nrocks from the earth’s interior. From a similar source are formed lavas\r\nand volcanic ash, but these flow out or are ejected on the surface of\r\nthe earth where they cool so rapidly that no crystals form.\r\nExceptionally fast cooling or chilling of molten masses, moreover, forms\r\nvolcanic glass or obsidian. It is by the application of this same\r\nprinciple that crystal forming is prevented in the manufacture of common\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nThe large size of the crystals forming the granite that fills cracks and\r\nfissures of the Inner Gorge at Grand Canyon indicates the considerable\r\ndepth at which it was formed and is further evidence of the great\r\nmountains that existed in this region during the first era in geologic\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n                           THE ALGONKIAN ERA\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TILTED ROCKS OF THE SECOND ERA. GRAND CANYON]\r\n\r\nRocks formed during the second great era of the earth’s history are\r\ndistinctive in several respects. They are not highly altered or\r\ncompletely changed in form and structure as are those of the oldest era,\r\nbut are largely free from such changes and, for the most part, similar\r\nto rocks which are seen in the process of formation today. Furthermore,\r\nthey are known to contain definite traces of plant life, though no\r\ncertain forms of animal life have yet been found in them. They represent\r\na period probably as great as all of subsequent time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ALGONKIAN ROCKS IN GRAND CANYON\r\n\r\nAlong Bright Angel Canyon and in several other places in the Grand\r\nCanyon, rocks of Algonkian age, representing accumulations of sediments\r\nseveral thousand feet in thickness, are found. Below and to the north of\r\nDesert View (southeast of Cape Royal on the North Rim) they form the\r\nopen floor of the Canyon. Everywhere the most conspicuous layer of this\r\nseries is a mud rock of brilliant vermilion color. However, the rocks\r\nalso include a conglomerate or pebble layer, a dark limestone formed\r\nprincipally by plants, and a purple quartzite made by the consolidation\r\nof the grains of a sandstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FORMATION OF MOUNTAINS\r\n                          (THE ALGONKIAN ERA)\r\n\r\nThe Algonkian rocks of the Grand Canyon region were bent and broken into\r\nmountains at an early date. In many places sloping layers showing the\r\nsteep angle at which they were tilted are easily visible, even from the\r\nCanyon rim. Folded areas and strata which have been shattered are also\r\nconspicuous features here and there. The mountains which they formed,\r\nhowever, are now missing for they were worn away in large measure by\r\nslow erosion. Today only remnants—small hills on a general level\r\nsurface—remain in the lower parts of Grand Canyon to tell the story.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             EARLY CLIMATES\r\n                          (THE ALGONKIAN ERA)\r\n\r\nThe rocks of Algonkian age are roughly estimated to be at least six or\r\nseven hundred million years old, yet from all indications they were\r\nformed under conditions of climate not unlike those of far later periods\r\nof history. In several parts of the world traces of great ice\r\nsheets—glaciers which scratched and eroded the surface—are found\r\npreserved in Algonkian rocks. In other places, including the Grand\r\nCanyon, ancient flows of lava are found where they gushed out upon the\r\nsurface of an old land mass. Among the rocks below Desert View (Navajo)\r\nPoint and bordering on the Colorado River may readily be seen several\r\nblack cliffs formed by the volcanic activity of this early age.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant red shales of Algonkian age found in the lower parts of\r\nthe Grand Canyon were formed as muds, accumulated probably by large\r\nrivers. In these muds are found preserved great quantities of ripple\r\nmarks, indications of changing currents, also the moulds of salt\r\ncrystals, and large shrinkage cracks resulting from a very hot sun. In\r\nbrief, these criteria point toward a hot and probably arid climate in\r\nthis region during that chapter of history.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           OLDEST KNOWN LIFE\r\n                          (THE ALGONKIAN ERA)\r\n\r\nThe oldest forms of life represented in rocks of Grand Canyon are found\r\nin strata of the Second, or Algonkian, Era. Certain layers of limestone\r\nshowing peculiar structural patterns on their surfaces are interpreted\r\nas being the reefs built up through the activities of primitive\r\none-celled plants known as algae. Similar structures are being formed\r\ntoday by plants of this type. Near Harper’s Ferry, West Virginia, for\r\nexample, algae are building up limestone layers almost identical to the\r\nfossil ones found in the Algonkian rocks of Grand Canyon. In this\r\nconnection, it is interesting to note that because of this similarity of\r\nthe present to the past, the reality of the ancient plant structures was\r\nrecognized a few years ago. They were discovered at a place in the Grand\r\nCanyon just west of the mouth of Bright Angel Creek.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rocks of the Third Era in the Grand Canyon]\r\n\r\n  Rocks of the Fourth Era (Red Butte)\r\n  Rim of Grand Canyon\r\n  a~ Sandy limestone formed beneath the sea.

As will be seen in the succeeding pages, some of these\r\nrocks are sandstones formed from the sands of early beaches or sand dune\r\nareas, others are shales—the hardened muds of ancient river deltas—and\r\nstill others are limestones built up by accumulations of plant and\r\nanimal remains on sea bottoms. All are rocks formed by the deposition of\r\nsediments by wind and water during vast intervals of time. In them have\r\nbeen hidden and preserved many forms of life. Seashells, footprints,\r\nfern impressions, and various other traces of early plants and animals\r\nremain to tell the story of these ancient times. It is of special\r\ninterest to note that in rocks formed during the earliest part of this\r\nchapter are found the first definite traces of animal life, that in\r\nother rocks of this chapter have been found evidences of primitive fish,\r\nand that in the most recent rocks of this group occur the traces of\r\nearly reptiles, insects, ferns, and cone-bearing plants. In the walls of\r\nGrand Canyon examples of all of these fossils have been found, and these\r\nwill be described in detail in the succeeding pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   FIRST ANIMAL LIFE—THE TONTO ROCKS\r\n                           (CAMBRIAN PERIOD)\r\n\r\nGreat highlands which were formed in the Grand Canyon region during the\r\nSecond Era of history were afterwards gradually worn away by erosion\r\nuntil near the start of the next era a flat, almost featureless plain\r\nexisted. Here and there, however, isolated hills of dark, crystalline\r\nrocks of the First Era stood above the general surface, as seen opposite\r\nYaki point. In other places, such as to the west of where Bright Angel\r\nCreek now flows, small mountains of red Algonkian rocks (Second Era)\r\nremained. Around and against these, sediments were then deposited.\r\nPebbles and sands accumulated, forming a thick layer which today appears\r\nas the brown sandstone rim of the Inner Gorge. These represent the first\r\ndeposits of the Third Era. But the sea was encroaching upon the land\r\nduring this period, and gradually the sand deposited near shore was\r\ncovered by mud and this in turn by lime far out from the beach. Today\r\nthis series of sand, mud and lime is found represented in the rocks of\r\nthe Tonto Platform in Grand Canyon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE ON CAMBRIAN SEA FLOOR IN GRAND CANYON REGION\r\n(RECONSTRUCTION. MUSEUM NORTHERN ARIZONA)]\r\n\r\nAlong the Tonto Trail a few hundred yards east of Indian Gardens\r\nnumerous primitive sea animals have been found buried and preserved in\r\nlayers of thin shale. Many of these are creatures with rounded shells\r\nsmaller than the nail of a person’s little finger, others are animals\r\nrelated to the snail, and still others are crab-like creatures known as\r\ntrilobites. The trilobites undoubtedly were the rulers of that age for\r\nthey excelled not only in numbers but in size. Some specimens from Grand\r\nCanyon have measured over three inches in length. Despite this size,\r\nhowever, the trilobites and their associates from the Tonto Platform\r\nrepresent some of the earliest known forms of animal life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRILOBITES PRESERVED IN GREEN SHALE OF GRAND CANYON WALLS\r\n(ONE-EIGHTH NATURAL SIZE)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE MISSING PERIODS OF THE THIRD ERA\r\n                   (ORDOVICIAN AND SILURIAN PERIODS)\r\n\r\nThe geologist has found that two long periods of history are lacking in\r\nthe great succession of ages represented by the strata in the Grand\r\nCanyon walls. These missing periods which belong to the Third Era are\r\nknown as the Ordovician, the time when fish first appeared in the seas,\r\nand the Silurian, the time when millipeds and scorpions became our first\r\nair breathers. These ages immediately followed the Cambrian and involved\r\nmillions of years. The absence of the first of them is explained by some\r\ngeologists as the result of its rocks having been completely worn away\r\nat a later time. It seems more probable, however, that the Grand Canyon\r\nregion was above sea level during these two ages so that no sediments\r\nwere accumulated and consequently no rocks formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE AGE OF FISH\r\n                           (DEVONIAN PERIOD)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FRESH WATER FISH OF DEVONIAN AGE]\r\n\r\nDuring that period of geologic time commonly known as the “age of fish,”\r\nsands and limes were accumulated on the surface of the Grand Canyon\r\nregion filling in old river channels and burying the bodies of fish and\r\nother animals. The deposits formed at this time were later eroded to a\r\nlarge extent. The surface of the land was worn and washed away until\r\nfinally only isolated patches or pockets of limestone and sandstone\r\nremained. These we find today exposed in the walls of the Grand Canyon\r\noccurring just at the base of the great Redwall cliff in about fifteen\r\ndifferent localities.\r\n\r\nAlthough fish were rulers of the age during Devonian times, they were of\r\nprimitive types and apparently depended for defense upon bony skin\r\narmour rather than upon speed. The plates and scales of fresh-water fish\r\nhave been found preserved in the lavender rocks of this age in the Grand\r\nCanyon.\r\n\r\n\r\n             SEA LIFE FROM THE NORTH—THE REDWALL LIMESTONE\r\n             (MISSISSIPPIAN OR LOWER CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REDWALL FOSSILS (NATURAL SIZE)]\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent and conspicuous features of the Grand Canyon\r\nis the great red cliff of limestone about midway in its walls. This\r\ncliff is the highest in the Canyon—averaging about 550 feet in the area\r\nof Bright Angel Canyon. In most places it is almost vertical, and in\r\nsome it even overhangs to such an extent that a visitor once aptly said,\r\n“The Washington Monument might be placed beneath it and kept out of the\r\nrain.”\r\n\r\nTo the prospector this formation is known as the Blue Lime; to the\r\ngeologist it is the Redwall Limestone. Both are correct. Actually the\r\nrock is a rather pure limestone of a grey or bluish color, but in most\r\nplaces where seen, its surface has been stained a bright red by iron\r\noxides from above. It appears throughout the Grand Canyon as a wide band\r\nor ribbon of red.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAVASU FALLS IN REDWALL LIMESTONE. GRAND CANYON]\r\n\r\nLarge amphitheaters, many curving alcoves, caves, and solution tunnels\r\nare all characteristic features of the great Redwall. It is composed of\r\nrelatively pure lime so rain and other waters have a chemical action\r\nupon it—they leach and dissolve it. Waters all tend to drain toward\r\ncurving centers, and so increase this curving. Everywhere the rounding\r\noff of corners takes place.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Redwall Limestone is as interesting as its form. The\r\npurity of the lime indicates that it was built up in a relatively wide\r\nand quiet sea. Its composition represents a vast accumulation of the\r\nskeletons of ancient plants and animals. Seashells are found in great\r\nnumbers, some of them preserved in delicate detail. These and other\r\nforms of ocean life clearly indicate that a great sea connection then\r\nexisted between this region and that of western Canada to the north.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     TRACKS IN THE SUPAI SANDSTONE\r\n                            (PERMIAN PERIOD)\r\n\r\nDuring that period in geological history known as the Permian, when some\r\nof the beds of soft coal in eastern America were being formed, a large\r\narea in northern Arizona was receiving red sediments from the east,\r\nprobably carried by rivers from the granitic highlands of that region.\r\nToday these sediments appear in the Grand Canyon walls as alternating\r\nlayers of red sandstone and shale immediately above the great Redwall.\r\nThey are almost a thousand feet in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRACKS OF SHORT-LEGGED PREHISTORIC ANIMAL. SUPAI\r\nFORMATION. GRAND CANYON]\r\n\r\nWhen the red beds were accumulating in this region, the climate probably\r\nwas more or less arid; the vegetation consisted principally of ferns and\r\nother lowly plants; and the animal life included a group of large but\r\nprimitive four-footed creatures. Numerous tracks of the latter,\r\npreserved in the walls of Grand Canyon, have provided one of the most\r\ninteresting discoveries of recent years. Some of these footprints are\r\nseveral inches in length, and the number of toes varies between three\r\nand five. They show no close relationship to the tracks of other\r\nlocalities, and apparently represent a fauna new to North America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     LANDSCAPES OF THE HERMIT SHALE\r\n                            (PERMIAN PERIOD)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANDSCAPE AT TIME HERMIT SHALE WAS FORMING\r\n(RECONSTRUCTION. MUSEUM NORTHERN ARIZONA)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOSSIL FERN FROM THE HERMIT SHALE (REDUCED)]\r\n\r\nConcerning the conditions under which the topmost red formation of the\r\nGrand Canyon (the Hermit Shale) was developed, and the nature of its\r\norigin, we have today a rather definite and interesting picture. A\r\nwealth of fossil plants and a number of tracks of animals have been\r\nfound excellently preserved in its muddy layers, and by means of these\r\nand other indications the following conclusions have been drawn.\r\n\r\nThe Hermit Shale represents accumulations of mud and fine sandy material\r\ndeposited probably by streams flowing from the northeast. Here and there\r\nare found evidences of pools and arroyos with wavy ripple marks on their\r\nborders and a thin film of shiny slime covering the surface. The trails\r\nof worms, the footprints of small salamander-like animals, and the\r\nfronds of ferns, mostly mascerated or wilted, are found delicately\r\npreserved in this slime. Raindrop impressions, the molds of salt\r\ncrystals and numerous sun-cracks also add to the picture. This region\r\nhas been described by Dr. David White as “the scene of showers, burning\r\nsun, hailstorms, occasional torrents and periods of drought and drying\r\nup of pools” during Hermit times.\r\n\r\nThirty-five species of plants are at present known from the Hermit Shale\r\nof Grand Canyon. Many of these have not been found elsewhere in the\r\nworld, though some were representatives of European plants, and others\r\nhad their closest relations in central Asia, India, Australia, Africa,\r\nand South America. This fossil flora consists principally of ferns and\r\nsmall cone-bearing plants, all of which were relatively dwarfed in size\r\nand appear less dense than those of corresponding age found in eastern\r\nAmerica. They apparently indicate a semi-arid climate with long dry\r\nseasons, for the absence of moist-climate and swamp-loving types is\r\nnoticeable.\r\n\r\nSeveral insect wings have been found in the Hermit Shale, one of which\r\nwas four inches in length. Numerous footprints of vertebrate animals\r\nhave also been found, and undoubtedly represent an interesting fauna.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      WIND-BLOWN SAND—THE COCONINO\r\n                            (PERMIAN PERIOD)\r\n\r\nThe light-colored formation which appears as a conspicuous ribbon-like\r\nband around the upper part of the Grand Canyon has long presented a\r\npuzzle concerning its origin. The grains of white sand of which it is\r\ncomposed apparently were deposited at steep angles, for the many and\r\nvaried slopes which were formed may be readily seen today on the surface\r\nof the rock. These slopes were probably once the lee sides of sand dunes\r\ndeposited by winds in an area bordering the sea. We find the only traces\r\nof life in this formation represented by the trails of ancient worms and\r\ninsects, and by the foot-prints of early lizard, or salamander-like\r\ncreatures. Already the tracks of some 27 species of animals have been\r\ndiscovered in this sandstone within the Grand Canyon, though strangely\r\nenough no bones have yet been located.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WIND-BLOWN SAND.

ENSOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n       WARM SEAS FROM THE WEST—THE TOROWEAP AND KAIBAB FORMATIONS\r\n                            (PERMIAN PERIOD)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEASHELLS FROM KAIBAB LIMESTONE (REDUCED)]\r\n\r\nAlong both sides of Grand Canyon at the top, two buff and gray layers of\r\nlimestone stand out as massive cliffs separated by a tree-covered slope.\r\nThe upper of these limestones forms the plateau surface and may be seen\r\nfor a great distance in every direction. Both layers were formed as the\r\nresult of vast accumulations of organic and sandy materials on sea\r\nbottoms, and in places are composed largely of the remains of marine\r\nlife—shells, corals and sponges. The teeth of sharks have also been\r\nfound in the upper limestone.\r\n\r\nSEA LILY OR CRINOID (REDUCED)\r\n\r\nHORN CORAL (NATURAL SIZE)\r\n\r\nDuring the early stages of the period when these marine animals lived\r\nand multiplied in the region, a great body of salt water extended over\r\nits surface from far to the west, remained briefly, then retreated from\r\nthe area. Soon, however, marine waters advanced once more and another\r\nsea was formed with its shoreline extending eastward even beyond the\r\nregion in which we now find Grand Canyon. Evidences of the second and\r\nlarger sea are found beyond Flagstaff to the south, in the Painted\r\nDesert to the east, and almost to Zion Canyon to the north.\r\n\r\nThe presence of corals and sharks’ teeth not only indicates that this\r\nregion was covered on more than one occasion by marine waters, but also\r\nsuggests that these seas were warm and shallow. This is estimated to\r\nhave been some 200 million years ago.\r\n\r\nFOSSIL SHARK’S TOOTH (NATURAL SIZE)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROCKS OF THE FOURTH ERA\r\nThe Painted Desert and Zion Canyon Region]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n                            THE MESOZOIC ERA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Chapter of the earth’s history is commonly known as “the age\r\nof dinosaurs.” Large reptiles were the dominating forms of life all over\r\nthe world during this age. Landscapes and types of climate varied\r\nconsiderably, and in the Grand Canyon region they changed completely\r\nseveral times. During some periods ocean bodies covered the country; at\r\nothers desert winds piled up dunes on the surface. Again this region was\r\nthe flood plain of rivers, where pebbles, mud and great logs of pine\r\nwere washed in and deposited. At still other times coal was formed in\r\nsome quantity. All of these interesting features of the Fourth Chapter\r\nwill be briefly treated in the pages following. Their records as found\r\nat Zion Canyon to the north, in the Painted Desert to the east, and at\r\nthe Petrified Forest to the south are such that a visitor to the region\r\ncan scarcely help but marvel and wonder at their meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n        REMNANTS OF YOUNGER STRATA—RED BUTTE AND CEDAR MOUNTAIN\r\n                 (MOENKOPI FORMATION: TRIASSIC PERIOD)\r\n\r\nTwo isolated hills of unusual interest rise above the plateau surface\r\nnear Grand Canyon. Looking east from Desert View (Navajo) Point one of\r\nthese, a flat-topped mesa called Cedar Mountain, may be seen. The other,\r\nknown as Red Butte, is a rounded hill about fifteen miles to the south\r\nof Grand Canyon village. The most interesting feature of these hills is\r\nfound in the fact that they are composed for the most part of red\r\nsandstones and shales which once formed a continuous layer over this\r\nentire plateau region. These same rocks are found throughout southern\r\nUtah to the north, and in the Painted Desert to the east. Except at Red\r\nButte and Cedar Mountain they have been completely stripped off and\r\neroded away from the vicinity of Grand Canyon. The time involved in this\r\nerosion was tremendous and the consequences widespread. As a result the\r\npresent flat plateau surface was formed—a great plain high above sea\r\nlevel. The persistence of Red Butte and Cedar Mountain against time and\r\nthe elements is easily explained, moreover, by the hard lava cap of the\r\nformer and the protecting layer of pebble-rock on top of the latter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CEDAR MOUNTAIN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED BUTTE]\r\n\r\nThe red sandstones and shales found in Red Butte and Cedar Mountain were\r\nformed from sands and muds accumulated during the early part of the\r\nTriassic Age—the beginning of the fourth great era of history. Near\r\nFlagstaff at the southernmost limit of the formation have been found\r\nmany tracks and trails left by small crawling animals which indicate a\r\nshore environment in that section. In the same formation found in Utah\r\nand other places to the north are many seashells of various types.\r\nGypsum, an indication of arid climate, is also found to a large extent\r\nin the rocks of this group.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE PETRIFIED FOREST\r\n           (SHINARUMP AND CHINLE FORMATIONS; TRIASSIC PERIOD)\r\n\r\nThe Petrified Forests of northern Arizona and southern Utah were formed\r\nfrom trees which grew during a period known as the Triassic. The type of\r\nenvironment in the Painted Desert region during that period makes a very\r\ninteresting speculation. The landscape of this ancient country, as\r\ninterpreted from the present rock formations found there, was that of a\r\nlow, flat area, perhaps a floodplain, where rivers and streams meandered\r\nback and forth, depositing first large pebbles and sand, and later a\r\ngreat thickness of finer material consisting of sand and much mud. It\r\nwas by these streams that a great quantity of logs of evergreen trees\r\nwas carried down probably from mountains to the south or southwest. Many\r\nof the tree trunks were worn and battered on the way, and in this region\r\n(from southern Utah to the vicinity of Adamana and Holbrook) they were\r\nburied in great numbers among the depositing sediments. All four of the\r\nPetrified Forests south of Adamana originated in this manner—and\r\nprobably represent old log-jams. Nine miles north of Adamana, however,\r\nis the North Sigillaria Forest where the trees are found standing as\r\nthey grew.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETRIFIED FOREST. ARIZONA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETRIFIED LOGS OF TRIASSIC AGE]\r\n\r\nA large majority of the fossil trees in Petrified Forest National\r\nMonument represent a pine-like species belonging to a group now extinct\r\nin the northern hemisphere. Some individuals of this type have diameters\r\nas great as ten feet and heights of more than 200 feet. Four or five\r\nother varieties of tree occur but they are less common and rather\r\ninconspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe process by which these trees were changed to stone took place a very\r\nlong time after they were buried beneath sands and silts. At a time\r\nprobably millions of years later, waters bearing in solution the mineral\r\nsilica passed through the rocks of this region. Particle by particle\r\nwood was decayed, and almost simultaneously it was replaced by silica.\r\nThe brilliant colors found in much of it are due to small quantities of\r\niron and manganese which were introduced in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nThe wicked-looking upper jaw of a phytosaur—relative of the\r\ncrocodile—has been discovered buried in one of the colorful mounds of\r\nmud out in the Petrified Forest. In nearby deposits are found still\r\nother fossils including ferns preserved in delicate detail and clamlike\r\nshells. These, together with the petrified logs of evergreen trees, make\r\nthe picture very much alive and real to one whose imagination allows him\r\nto review these fascinating early pages in history.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            DINOSAUR TRACKS\r\n                   (WINGATE-KAYENTA; JURASSIC PERIOD)\r\n\r\nDinosaur means “terrible lizard.” Everyone has heard this name and\r\nattaches to it at least a vague conception of a creature of peculiar\r\nshape and tremendous size. In the dim far-away past these giant reptiles\r\nlived, developed and died in many parts of this country, but to most of\r\nus, they are only fantastic creatures in literature—not live or moving\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DINOSAUR TRACKS. PAINTED DESERT]\r\n\r\nThe reality of the dinosaur should become apparent to those who travel\r\nthrough the Painted Desert region of Arizona. In that country the grey\r\nand red hills of clay, the cliffs of sand and the many brightly colored\r\nlayers of hardened mud represent a part of the ancient landscape in\r\nwhich lived the “terrible lizards.” Furthermore, life definitely inserts\r\nitself into this picture when a person sees in the rocks the very\r\nthree-toed tracks left by the dinosaur. Who can deny the story of life\r\nwhen he can place his fingers in the foot impressions and measure the\r\nstrides of these animals—many of them—both large and small? Such is the\r\nprivilege of those who visit the Painted Desert just south of Tuba City.\r\n\r\nThe tracks of the dinosaurs are found in rocks which apparently were\r\nformed from river deposits of sands and muds. In other rocks closely\r\nassociated have been found the bones of dinosaurs, other reptiles, and\r\nanimals related to the frog or toad. Some of these creatures apparently\r\nwere “largely if not entirely terrestrial in habit” while others\r\nprobably lived in either fresh water streams or swamps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PAINTED DESERT]\r\n\r\n\r\n          THE ROCKS OF ZION CANYON AND RAINBOW NATURAL BRIDGE\r\n                  (NAVAJO SANDSTONE; JURASSIC PERIOD)\r\n\r\nThe lure of a desert with its drifting sands, its scattered oases, and\r\nits broad extent has ever been great. Today in the Southwest, cut off\r\nfrom the moist ocean breezes of the west by the lofty Sierra Nevadas and\r\nfurther isolated by the Rocky Mountains to the east, is America’s great\r\ndesert region. Here the winds and the rains are constantly at work\r\ntearing down and sculpturing the great land masses, while in places the\r\nwind is piling up the sand and debris to form dunes and new lands.\r\n\r\nFar back in history, probably in what is known as the Jurassic Period,\r\nsouthwestern United States witnessed conditions of climate and\r\nenvironment which were perhaps somewhat comparable though probably far\r\nmore desert-like than those which exist today. The land which had been\r\nraised in the preceding period to form a great flood-plain remained\r\nabove sea level. Lofty mountains were formed to the west and like the\r\nSierras of today, they robbed the east-travelling winds of their\r\nmoisture. These mountains were very high and furnished a vast supply of\r\nsediment which was carried down into the arid basin to the east, worked\r\nand reworked by the wind, and finally deposited as a great layer of\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZION CANYON. NAVAJO SANDSTONE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAINBOW NATURAL BRIDGE. NAVAJO SANDSTONE]\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Vermilion Cliffs and the White Cliffs of southern Utah\r\nwhich together form the walls of Zion Canyon, the red sandstone out of\r\nwhich is carved Rainbow Natural Bridge, and the jagged Echo Cliffs seen\r\nto the northeast of Desert View (Navajo) Point at Grand Canyon are all\r\nmonuments of the Jurassic Age. These high walls are of sandstone—formed\r\nfrom sand steeply piled at varying angles. They have been aptly called\r\n“cliffs of fossil sand dunes.”\r\n\r\nWhile desert winds and a burning sun were playing a prominent part in\r\nthe Grand Canyon region, during the Jurassic Age, other sections of the\r\ncountry were favored with a moist climate and luxuriant vegetation.\r\nDinosaurs and other reptiles waded about in swamps and developed to\r\ntremendous sizes. The country teemed with life, very different from that\r\nof today, yet none the less interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      FROM SEASHELLS TO COAL BEDS\r\n            (DAKOTA. MANCOS, MESA VERDE; CRETACEOUS PERIOD)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRETACEOUS SHELLS FROM SOUTHERN UTAH]\r\n\r\nDuring the last part of the “Age of Dinosaurs,” in that period of\r\nhistory known as the Cretaceous, much of northeastern Arizona, southern\r\nUtah, and northwestern New Mexico apparently was submerged beneath a\r\nsea. Mollusks abounded, and various other types of water animals swam or\r\ncrawled in this region. Their shells were buried and preserved among the\r\nmuds and limes which were accumulating, and today many of them are found\r\nin the rocks of this age.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, the Cretaceous seas were expelled from their basins in\r\nthe Southwest. Low-lying coastal plains—two hundred and more miles\r\nwide—with luxuriant vegetation and perhaps swamps, replaced them, and\r\nthese new conditions were the means of much coal formation. Great\r\naccumulations of vegetable matter, buried beneath sediments brought down\r\nby streams, eventually formed the many layers of coal which today are\r\nfound in various places in Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico. In the last\r\nnamed state some extensive and valuable coal beds are found in rocks of\r\nthis age near Gallup. Impressions of leaves and pieces of fossil wood\r\nare also numerous among these rocks and they indicate that there was a\r\nwarm, moist climate during that period in which they grew.\r\n\r\nThe Cretaceous Period ended with a general change of conditions or a\r\nrevolution, the world over. Many of the seas were changed into lands,\r\nnew mountains were formed and the dinosaurs and giant reptiles were\r\nlargely replaced by mammals and other modern varieties of life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COAL CANYON.

With the exceptions of\r\nthe fresh water deposits formed during the very early part (Bryce Canyon\r\nformations) and of the many volcanoes built in the later stages, no\r\nrocks were formed here during that chapter. This region was then above\r\nsea level and erosion was working continuously. The great level plain\r\nwhich today forms the plateau surface at Grand Canyon was created by the\r\nwearing away of overlying rocks. The Grand Canyon itself and also Zion\r\nand Bryce Canyons were sculptured. In fact, all of the features of\r\nerosion which today make this desert region so picturesque and fanciful\r\nowe their origin to the various agents of erosion which have been at\r\nwork during this most recent chapter of the world’s history.\r\n\r\nThe “Age of Mammals” is a name often applied to the last era. Creatures\r\nnot unlike some of the most advanced forms of life found today lived\r\neven in the early parts of this age. As the era progressed,\r\nnevertheless, a development was noticeable until finally in the very\r\nlast part man himself appeared. Though few remains of this interesting\r\nand comparatively recent life have been found in northern Arizona and\r\nsouthern Utah, still a few elephant tusks, some camel teeth and the more\r\nrecent remains of early cliff and pueblo dwellers give evidence of a\r\nthrilling history during parts of this era.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages will be found brief sketches of some of these\r\ninteresting features represented in the Grand Canyon region. The many\r\nactivities of erosion such as canyon-forming, the eruption of volcanoes,\r\ninfluences of the great ice sheets of the north, crustal movements,\r\nfragmentary evidences of early mammals, and lastly early man himself are\r\nall introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BRYCE CANYON FORMATION\r\n                        (WASATCH: EOCENE EPOCH)\r\n\r\nThe formation found at Bryce Canyon and at Cedar Breaks in southern Utah\r\nhas the distinction of being composed of the most recently formed\r\nsedimentary rocks in this plateau region. It was during the early part\r\nof the last great chapter of history that lime and some sand were\r\naccumulating here in fresh water. They are believed by most geologists\r\nto represent the deposits of ancient lakes and in them are found\r\nfreshwater mollusks. Rivers and other agents of deposition probably also\r\ntook a part in the forming of these strata as is indicated by the great\r\nirregularity and variety of sand and other sediments. Truly the origin\r\nof these rocks presents an interesting problem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRYCE CANYON\r\n                                      AERIAL PHOTO COPYRIGHT FRED HARVEY]\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: MAP OF THE COLORADO RIVER]\r\n\r\nThe delicate and beautiful colors of Bryce are due to the white\r\nlimestone which in many places retains its creamy color, but in others\r\nhas been stained a vivid pink by the drainage from upland washes. The\r\nCanyon itself is almost entirely the result of running water which has\r\ncarved and etched its pattern during geologically recent times. Just as\r\nthe Grand Canyon and Zion Canyon were made possible by a great elevation\r\nof the land in this region, so also was Bryce affected. The small\r\nstreams of the Paunsagunt Plateau were given power to cut into the\r\nsandstones and limestones which form the Pink Cliffs, and due to the\r\npeculiar nature of these rocks the many spires, promontories, and\r\npinnacles were formed as remnants of erosion in the valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        A GREAT EROSION SURFACE\r\n                             (CENOZOIC AGE)\r\n\r\nThe level, flat and almost featureless skyline of Grand Canyon is an\r\noutstanding characteristic of the plateau of northern Arizona. This\r\nsurface is fascinating to some; monotonous to others. To all, it is one\r\nof the most striking features of the region. The history which it\r\nrepresents, moreover, is of extreme interest and impressive length. Here\r\non the top of the great plateau is seen the result of vast erosion. Long\r\nperiods of work by water, wind, and other elements have gradually worn\r\naway strata that were once above. Just as erosion is forming the Grand\r\nCanyon today, so it has accomplished this much greater task. Several\r\nthousand feet of materials have been removed from the surface over much\r\nof this entire region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GREAT EROSION SURFACE\r\n                                                   NATIONAL PARK SERVICE]\r\n\r\nSouth of Grand Canyon, at Red Butte, east in the Painted Desert, and\r\nnorth in Utah are found remnants of those rocks which once formed a\r\ncontinuous layer over the present plateau. Red sandstones and shales\r\nrepresenting former sands and muds of shallow water and beach,\r\npebble-rocks and marls deposited by rivers and containing the remains of\r\ncone-bearing trees, crocodiles, and dinosaurs—all these rocks and\r\nprobably others once gave color to this area just as today they lend\r\nbrilliance to the Painted Desert and to southern Utah. In those places\r\nhigh cliffs mark the lines of recession—the stages of the constant\r\nretreat of the rocks from the Grand Canyon region before ever-working\r\nforces of erosion. Red Butte to the south of Grand Canyon, on the other\r\nhand, has been preserved as an isolated remnant of the same rocks by its\r\nhard, resistant cap of lava. Thus we have mute evidence of a\r\ntremendously large and wonderful story of former lands, and of their\r\nlater wearing away to leave the great plain which now forms the surface\r\nof the plateau about Grand Canyon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CRUSTAL MOVEMENT AT GRAND CANYON\r\n                             (CENOZOIC AGE)\r\n\r\nMany visitors to the Grand Canyon are distinctly surprised when they\r\nfind numerous seashells, corals, and sponges, beautifully preserved in\r\nthe limestone layer upon which they are standing. The idea immediately\r\noccurs that this region was once beneath the sea. Obviously then either\r\nthe land has risen or the ocean has receded.\r\n\r\nA careful study of the region shows that the rock strata which form the\r\ngreat plateau of northern Arizona have been bent into a huge arch or\r\ndome. The Santa Fe railway travels steadily up grade to the south rim of\r\nGrand Canyon which is 7,000 feet above sea level. The north rim is a\r\nthousand feet higher, while fifteen miles farther north a high point of\r\n9,000 feet is attained. In southern Utah the limestone layer which forms\r\nthe top of Grand Canyon passes beneath the surface at 4,000 feet.\r\n\r\nWhy crustal movements occur is not definitely known though many theories\r\nhave been advanced to explain them. It is significant, nevertheless,\r\nthat such movements have gone on in all parts of the world many times in\r\nhistory, and that in many regions they are taking place today. Parts of\r\nthe California coast are known to be rising, while some other parts of\r\nthe country are sinking slowly.\r\n\r\nThe question of whether or not the Grand Canyon region is still rising\r\ntoday cannot be answered with assuredness, but certain it is that it has\r\nbeen both above and below sea level at many different times in history.\r\n\r\nIt is the slow sinking of the region which has made possible great\r\naccumulations of sediments and the building up of rock layers. It is the\r\nrising of the land which has brought about great cycles of erosion such\r\nas apparently have occurred several times in the history of the\r\nSouthwest. Since today this region is high above sea level, erosion is\r\nrapid. Not only does this elevation give the Colorado River and its\r\ntributaries speed and power to erode downward, but also it gives them\r\nunusual depth through which to cut and to carve the canyons which are\r\ntheir valleys. Without the rising of this plateau region, the colossal\r\ngorges, the weird, sculptured forms of erosion, all of the fascinating\r\nand picturesque features of this region could not be.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CUTTING THE GRAND CANYON\r\n                   (PLIOCENE AND PLEISTOCENE EPOCHS)\r\n\r\n  “WHAT FORCE HAS FORMED THIS MASTERPIECE OF AWE?\r\n  WHAT HANDS HAVE WROUGHT THESE WONDERS IN THE WASTE?\r\n  O RIVER, GLEAMING IN THE NARROW RIFT\r\n  OF GLOOM THAT CLEAVES THE VALLEY’S NETHER DEEP,\r\n  FIERCE COLORADO, PRISONED BY THY TOIL,\r\n  AND BLINDLY TOILING STILL TO REACH THE SEA.\r\n  THY WATERS, GATHERED FROM THE SNOWS AND SPRINGS\r\n  AMID THE UTAH HILLS, HAVE CARVED THIS ROAD\r\n  OF GLORY TO THE CALIFORNIA GULF.”\r\n                                                         —HENRY VAN DYKE\r\n\r\nVery difficult is it for the average human fully to realize, to\r\ncomprehend the tremendous power of running water. One does not question\r\nthe origin of a wayside gulch cut out by recent storms, nor is it hard\r\nto visualize the formation of some steep-walled glen where a\r\nfast-rushing stream is found at work in its bottom. The vast Grand\r\nCanyon, however, an extreme example of erosion, seems a bit too\r\nlarge—too wide and deep—to be attributed alone to the power of any river\r\nsuch as exists today. But the Grand Canyon—the greatest of chasms—is\r\nnothing more than the result of the work of running water over a long\r\nperiod of history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSS SECTIONS OF GRAND CANYON]\r\n\r\nNEAR THE WESTERN END OF NATIONAL PARK. ROCKS OF THE THIRD ERA ALONE HERE\r\nFORM THE CANYON WALLS. THOSE OF THE FIRST ERA ARE PROBABLY NOT FAR BELOW\r\nTHE RIVER BED.\r\n\r\nCENTRAL OR BRIGHT ANGEL AREA.

THE FLOOR OF THE CANYON IS HERE\r\nFORMED OF TILTED ROCKS OF THE SECOND ERA. THE UPPER WALLS ARE OF\r\nCOMPARATIVELY HORIZONTAL ROCKS OF THE THIRD ERA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRAND CANYON]\r\n\r\nThose who have been to the rocky shores of the Colorado River in Grand\r\nCanyon, who have heard its wild roar, and seen its mad waves rush along\r\ntheir course, need no further introduction to the power of this stream.\r\nIt is a mighty river! In the open stretch above the mouth of Bright\r\nAngel Creek its speed varies between two and a half and ten miles an\r\nhour. Its width at the same place is over one hundred yards and its\r\ndepth between twelve and forty-five feet. But the Colorado River alone\r\nwould have made but little progress were it not for the many\r\nrocks—boulders, pebbles, and sand grains—all of which act as tools and\r\nare constantly gouging and cutting as they move. Just as sandpaper\r\nrubbing over the same place continuously leaves its groove, so this\r\ncombination of power and tools is ever carving its course. The Colorado\r\nRiver during a vast period has cut almost a mile vertically through all\r\nof the great rock layers now exposed in the walls of Grand Canyon.\r\n\r\nThe width of the Grand Canyon, an average of about ten miles, has been\r\nbrought about by the wearing and washing-in of its sides by natural\r\nprocesses of erosion. Rain, wind, frost, temperature changes and plant\r\naction have all combined to break down the Canyon walls. The soft rocks\r\non the slopes are continually being broken and removed; the more\r\nresistant ones in the cliffs are undermined so in time fall down. While\r\nthe river has been cutting deeper, the Canyon’s sides have been steadily\r\nreceding. The Grand Canyon itself is the valley of the Colorado, and its\r\nnarrowness rather than its width is the remarkable feature when compared\r\nwith the valleys of other rivers. This present canyon profile has been\r\nbrought about as the combined effects of an arid climate and a rapidly\r\ndownward cutting river.\r\n\r\nEven a distant view of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon bottom is\r\nsufficient to convince one of the tremendous transporting power of this\r\nstream. Thus it not only does the work of cutting downward, but also\r\ncarries off the vast load of sand and silt which is continually emptied\r\ninto its waters. It has been aptly described as being “too thick to\r\ndrink but too thin to plow.” In this region the river known at its\r\nheadwaters as the “Silvery Colorado” bears even a higher percentage of\r\nsediment than does the muddy Mississippi-Missouri. It has been found\r\nfrom carefully made tests by the United States Geological Survey that\r\nthe Colorado River carries past any given point in the Grand Canyon an\r\naverage of nearly a million tons of sand and silt every day. Thus has\r\nthe Grand Canyon been excavated!\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE FORMING OF ZION CANYON\r\n                   (PLIOCENE AND PLEISTOCENE EPOCHS)\r\n\r\n“A Yosemite Valley in colors” is a very apt description which has often\r\nbeen applied to Zion Canyon in southern Utah. Sheer-walled with a\r\nbeautiful flat valley floor, this canyon is not unlike California’s\r\nglacier-carved fairyland in general size and shape, but in formation it\r\nhas a very different history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZION CANYON]\r\n\r\nThe brilliant Vermilion Cliffs which form the bottom two thousand feet\r\nof Zion’s walls and the contrasting White Cliffs which rise an\r\nadditional thousand feet are hard, resistant sandstones. Wherever these\r\nrocks are found, they form conspicuous perpendicular cliffs because of\r\ntheir hardness, yet even they show the results of the constant attacks\r\nof weather and erosion over long periods. From once continuous layers,\r\nthey have in many places gradually been cut and dissected by running\r\nwater until now numerous canyons expose their secrets.\r\n\r\nIt was relatively late in the last chapter of the earth’s history\r\n(Cenozoic Era) that the cutting of Zion and associated canyons was made\r\npossible by gradual though tremendous crustal movements in the region.\r\nThe then broad, low-lying country was raised several thousand feet to\r\nabout its present altitude. This was the means of giving power to the\r\nstreams, including the masterstream—the Virgin River. Steadily and\r\nrelentlessly these active agents of erosion, heavy-laden with their\r\ntools, the muds, sands, and pebbles, have been cutting notches and then\r\ncanyons. Zion Creek itself, which is one of the largest tributaries of\r\nthe Virgin River, has cut downward through all of the layers now exposed\r\nin the walls of its canyon, and the rock fragments derived from these\r\nhave been the means of grinding and gouging. As the stream has struggled\r\nin its course, these sides have slowly but surely receded through the\r\ncombined efforts of rain, wind, frost and plants. They have been\r\nundermined and otherwise attacked, but as yet represent comparatively\r\nlittle progress in widening. Beautiful Zion Canyon, therefore, has been\r\ncreated as the result of crustal movements bringing into action the\r\neffective cutting power of running water, assisted by all the\r\never-working forces of disintegration and decay.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GLACIERS\r\n                          (PLEISTOCENE EPOCH)\r\n\r\n“What part did glaciers play in cutting the Grand Canyon?” This is a\r\nquestion asked almost daily on the rim of that great chasm. Everyone has\r\nheard of the mighty ice sheets which somewhere back in geologic history\r\ncovered a large part of eastern and midwestern United States. Many\r\npeople have seen beautiful Yosemite Valley in the far west, and have\r\nbeen told how it was carved by the action of glaciers. It is not\r\naltogether strange, therefore, that visitors to the Grand Canyon should\r\nassociate the cutting power of ice with that tremendous gash in the\r\nearth’s surface. But geologists agree that the glaciers of the Ice Ages\r\nhad no direct part in the story of Grand Canyon. No scratches or gouges\r\nmade by ice are to be found on the canyon walls, no great rock piles\r\nformed at a glacier’s front are in evidence, and lastly, the very\r\nV-shape of the canyon itself is vastly different from the usual\r\nflat-bottomed valley scooped out by moving ice.\r\n\r\nDuring the last epoch of geologic history, climatic conditions the world\r\nover altered very materially. Upon five different occasions snow\r\naccumulated in the north to form extensive ice sheets which advanced\r\nsteadily toward the equator and then retreated with a later change in\r\nconditions. These were not the only ice ages in history, but they were\r\nof such a comparatively recent date that their influence is strongly\r\nfelt today in many parts of the world. At the time of greatest expansion\r\nthe glaciers reached New York in the east, Missouri in the mid west, and\r\nWashington in the far west. Contemporaneous with these main ice sheets,\r\nfurthermore, were large glaciers throughout the Rocky Mountains and the\r\nSierra Nevadas. In the mountains of Utah and even in the San Francisco\r\nPeaks, just south of the Grand Canyon, are found evidences of glaciers\r\nof this period. Evidently then, climatic conditions in the Southwest as\r\nelsewhere were greatly different from those of today. It is believed\r\nthat there was much more rainfall and less evaporation, as shown by the\r\nextensive lakes which existed in this region at that time. Furthermore,\r\nthe later melting of the glaciers must have supplied a vast quantity of\r\nwater to the Colorado River causing it to be far larger and more\r\npowerful than today.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SAN FRANCISCO MOUNTAIN VOLCANIC FIELD\r\n                   (PLIOCENE AND PLEISTOCENE EPOCHS)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF VOLCANOES FROM NORTH]\r\n\r\nOver a large part of the great plateau of northern Arizona are found\r\nsheets of hard lava and cone-shaped craters. The center of this volcanic\r\nactivity is located in the San Francisco Peaks just north of the town of\r\nFlagstaff, but lavas and cones are found westward beyond Williams and to\r\na considerable extent in every other direction. Looking south from Grand\r\nCanyon these peaks may be seen to rise high above the plateau and are a\r\nvery beautiful sight. From Flagstaff and Williams not only the mountains\r\nbut also great sheets of lava resting on the limestone surface are\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAN FRANCISCO MOUNTAIN—PAST AND PRESENT]\r\n\r\nIt was during the last great era in geological history, and for the most\r\npart after the Colorado River had already started to cut the Grand\r\nCanyon, that molten masses broke through and flowed out on the northern\r\nArizona plateau. Three great periods of such volcanic activity are\r\nrepresented by the rocks of this region and they range in age from\r\nprobably at least a million to relatively recent years.\r\n\r\nThe first general period of eruption in the San Francisco Volcanic Field\r\nwas characterized by a predominance of lava flows which formed a black\r\nrock known as basalt. These flows had an average thickness of about 50\r\nfeet and covered an area of 3,000 square miles. Accompanying them was\r\nthe formation of about a hundred small cinder cones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _San Francisco Mountain Volcanic Field_]\r\n\r\nIt was during the second period of volcanism that six isolated cones of\r\nlarge size and a somewhat greater number of small cones were formed by\r\nthe eruption of lavas widely ranging in composition. San Francisco Peak,\r\nthe largest of these cones and a dominant feature of the region reaches\r\nan elevation of 12,611 feet above sea level, or about 5,000 feet above\r\nthe plateau surface. It is composed of five different types, of\r\nlava—mostly red or light colored—which represent a corresponding number\r\nof distinct stages in eruption. Since the termination of its\r\nbuilding-up, the crest of this cone has been eroded and worn away to the\r\nextent of 3,000 feet as estimated from restored cross-sections. Other\r\nlarge volcanic craters of this period are Bill Williams (9,090 feet),\r\nKendrick (10,418 feet), O’Leary (8,925 feet) and Sitgreaves (9,240\r\nfeet).\r\n\r\nTwo hundred small cones and about twenty cubic miles of lava were\r\nproduced in this same general region during a third and relatively\r\nrecent period of volcanic activity. Much of this material overlies that\r\nof the two preceding periods. Probably the most interesting feature of\r\nthese cones and flows is their age, at least one cone being so recent\r\nthat ash from it buried numerous pithouses built by Pueblo Indians\r\nduring the eleventh century, A. D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAN FRANCISCO MOUNTAIN]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ELEPHANTS AND CAMELS\r\n                          (PLEISTOCENE EPOCH)\r\n\r\nIt was during the fifth and last great era in the earth’s history that\r\nmammals developed and that man made his appearance on earth. In many\r\nplaces in the world the remains of animals that lived during various\r\nparts of this age have been preserved. In the famous asphalt pits of\r\nCalifornia literally hundreds of the bones of large mammals—tigers,\r\nmastodons, wolves and many others—have been brought to light. In the\r\nreceding ice of northern Siberia, large mammoths—elephant-like animals\r\nrepresentative of the last era, but unknown today—have come to the\r\nsurface with even their skin and flesh preserved. But in the Grand\r\nCanyon region few fossils of the more recent times remain to tell the\r\nstory of the life that then roamed over this surface. For long ages this\r\nregion has been above the level of the sea, erosion has been continuous,\r\nso sediments have not accumulated and consequently few records of life\r\nhave been made.\r\n\r\nRecently near the western Navajo Indian agency at Tuba City, Arizona,\r\nhowever, the remains of several extinct animals were discovered. In a\r\nspring, hidden in a sandstone crevice, were found the tusks of a mammoth\r\nand some teeth which belonged to camels and bison. These were creatures\r\nnative to this country not far back in history. They give but a very\r\nfragmentary insight into the more recent geologic history of the region,\r\nbut they open up a field for interesting speculation to the imaginative\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELEPHANT AND CAMEL REMAINS]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ADVENT OF MAN IN THE SOUTHWEST\r\n                         (PLEISTOCENE HISTORIC)\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the chapters of the earth’s history and witnessing the\r\nprocession and the slow but steady development of life through the ages,\r\nit is very natural that one should wonder when man came upon the scene.\r\nCompared with the hundreds of millions of years which have elapsed since\r\nthe time of the first plants, or the millions of years following the\r\nfirst appearance of vertebrate animals, the age of man is as nothing. In\r\nthe Old World there is evidence that humans existed before the last\r\ngreat Ice Ages, more than a million years ago, but in the Americas human\r\noccupation is measured in terms of thousands of years only.\r\n\r\nNumerous recent discoveries in widely scattered parts of the Southwest\r\nindicate that man first occupied this region at a time when it was still\r\ninhabited by such animals as the ground sloth, the mammoth and the\r\ncamel. Artifacts of stone and bone have been found associated with the\r\nremains of these animals. Early man’s camp sites are located along the\r\nmargins of former extensive water bodies that existed throughout this\r\nregion at a time when the climate was far more humid than now. Little is\r\nknown about the nature or habits of these men, but it is supposed that\r\nthey were hunters with no knowledge of agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn the Grand Canyon region, the earliest human history with a clear,\r\ndetailed record goes back only to about 300 A. D. From that time up to\r\nthe present, however, the story of a flourishing and rapidly changing\r\ncivilization is well recorded. Although no written documents have been\r\nleft, abundant reliable information is available as a result of\r\narcheological excavations. Even the dates of many important events have\r\nbeen accurately determined through an ingenious method of calculating\r\nyears on the basis of growth rings in the trees used for house\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT INDIAN PETROGLYPHS, HEAD OF BRIGHT ANGEL TRAIL,\r\nGRAND CANYON]\r\n\r\nTwo distinct cultures are represented in the people who have inhabited\r\nthe Grand Canyon region for the past 1,600 years. The earlier and more\r\nprimitive was that of a long-headed type of man known as the\r\nBasketmaker. This culture was replaced at about 700 A. D. by another,\r\nprobably the result of new people entering the area, mixing with the\r\nolder inhabitants and introducing new ideas. A broad-headed type of man\r\nwho lived in pueblos and made pottery was the result. In the earliest\r\nstages he built only small one-roomed houses and made relatively crude\r\npottery, but by 1,200 A. D. his architecture and crafts had developed to\r\na very high stage as witnessed in the largest cliff-dwellings and\r\npueblos of the region. Since then the culture has declined. The Hopi\r\nIndians of today who live near the Painted Desert Country to the east of\r\nGrand Canyon are considered to be modern representatives of this group.\r\n\r\nIn numerous localities throughout southern Utah burials of the early\r\nFarmer Basketmaker period and also pithouses of the later Potter\r\nBasketmaker period have been found. One of the latter has also been\r\ndiscovered near Clear Creek in Grand Canyon. The remains of\r\ncliff-dwellings and surface houses built by the later Pueblo Indians are\r\ncommon everywhere throughout the region and show all stages of\r\ndevelopment. Those at and in the Grand Canyon are typical of the\r\nintermediate periods and, judging from pottery fragments in them, were\r\nmade by the ancestors of the modern Hopi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             GEOLOGICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY OF GRAND CANYON REGION\r\n      Including Zion, Bryce, Painted Desert, and Petrified Forest\r\n\r\n\r\n  Allen, V.
