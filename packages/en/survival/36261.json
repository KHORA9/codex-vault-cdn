These facts undoubtedly afford the means of\r\nattaining to very certain conclusions on many points relating to the\r\nhistory of life on the earth. But, on the other hand, they have\r\nfurnished the material for hypotheses which, though confidently affirmed\r\nto be indisputable, have no real foundation in nature, and are\r\nindirectly subversive of some of the most sacred beliefs of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances it is most desirable that those who are not\r\nspecialists in such matters should be in a position to judge for\r\nthemselves; and it does not appear impossible in the actual state of\r\nknowledge, to present, in terms intelligible to the general reader, such\r\na view of the ascertained sequence of the forms of life as may serve at\r\nonce to give exalted and elevating views of the great plan of creation,\r\nand to prevent the deceptions of pseudo-scientists from doing their evil\r\nwork. Difficulties, no doubt, attend the attempt. They arise from the\r\nnumber and variety of the facts, from the uncertainties attending many\r\nimportant points, from the new views constantly opening up in the\r\nprogress of discovery, and from the difficulty of presenting in an\r\nintelligible form the preliminary data in biology and geology necessary\r\nfor the understanding of the questions in hand. In order, as far as\r\npossible, to obviate these difficulties, the plan adopted in this work\r\nhas been to note the first known appearance of each leading type of\r\nlife, and to follow its progress down to the present time or until it\r\nbecame extinct. This method is at least natural and historical, and has\r\ncommended itself to the writer as giving a very clear comprehension of\r\nthe actual state of our knowledge, and as presenting some aspects of the\r\nsubject which may be novel and suggestive even to those who have studied\r\nit most deeply.\r\n\r\nIn selecting examples and illustrations, the writer has endeavoured to\r\navoid, as far as possible, those already familiar to the general reader.\r\nHe has carefully sought for the latest facts, while rejecting as\r\nunproved many things that are confidently asserted; and has endeavoured\r\nto avoid all that is irrelevant to the subject in hand, and to abstain\r\nfrom all technical terms not absolutely essential. In a work at once so\r\nwide in its scope, so popular in its character, and so limited in its\r\ndimensions, a certain amount of hostile criticism on the part of\r\nspecialists is to be expected, some portion of it perhaps just, other\r\nportions arising from narrow prejudices due to limited lines of study.\r\nThe writer is willing to receive such comments with attention and\r\ngratitude, but he would deprecate the misuse of them in the interest of\r\nthose coteries which are at present engaged in the effort to torture\r\nnature into a confession of belief in the doctrines of a materialistic\r\nor agnostic philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe title of the work was suggested by that of GaudryaEuro(TM)s recent\r\nattractive book, _Les EnchaA(R)nements du Monde animal_. It seemed well\r\nfitted to express the connection and succession of forms of life,\r\nwithout implying their derivation from one another, while it reminds us\r\nthat nature is not a fortuitously tangled skein, and that the links\r\nwhich connect man himself with the lowest and oldest creatures bind him\r\nalso to the throne of the Eternal.\r\n\r\nIn the few years that have elapsed since the publication of the first\r\nedition of this work, great additions have been made to our knowledge of\r\nfossil animals and plants. Many new species have been described, and\r\nmany new facts have been discovered, respecting species previously\r\nknown. This rapid progress of discovery has, however, invalidated few of\r\nthe statements made in the first edition, and has certainly established\r\nnothing against the general laws of the succession of life as stated in\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting phase of recent discovery is the tracing\r\nback of certain forms of life to earlier periods of the earthaEuro(TM)s\r\ngeological history. Some of the most recent facts of this kind are the\r\nfinding, by M. Charles Brongniart, of a fossil insect, allied to the\r\n_Blattae_ or cockroaches, in the Silurian of Spain, that of true\r\nScorpions in the Upper Silurian of Sweden by LindstrAÂm, and in the Upper\r\nSilurian of Scotland by Peach, who has also described fossil Millipedes\r\nfrom the Lower Devonian. The tendency of such discoveries is to carry\r\nfarther back the origin of highly specialised forms of life, and thus to\r\nrender less probable their origin by any process of gradual derivation.\r\n\r\nOther discoveries serve to fill up blanks in our knowledge, and thus to\r\nrender the geological record less imperfect. Of this kind is the close\r\napproximation now worked out in Western America between the end of the\r\nreign of the great MesozoA-c reptiles and the beginning of that of the\r\nmammals of the TertiaryaEuro\"a great and abrupt revolution, effected\r\napparently by a _coup de main_. I have myself had opportunity to show\r\nthat a similarly sharp line separates that quaint old MesozoA-c flora of\r\npines, cycads and ferns, which extends upward into the Lower Cretaceous,\r\nfrom the rich and luxuriant assemblage of broad-leaved trees of modern\r\naspect, which takes its place in the middle part of the same formation.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that these and similar discoveries, while they\r\nserve to bridge over gaps in the succession of organic beings, do not\r\nfavour the theory of slow modification of types. They rather point to a\r\nlaw of rapid development of new forms under special conditions as yet\r\nunknown to science, and this accompanied with the extinction of older\r\nspecies. Recent discoveries also present many remarkable instances of\r\nthe early introduction of highly specialised types, of higher forms\r\npreceding those that are lower in the same class, and of the persistence\r\nof certain types throughout geological time without any important\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n                                                              J.

SOURCES OF OUR\r\nKNOWLEDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is of the nature of true science to take nothing on trust or on\r\nauthority. Every fact must be established by accurate observation,\r\nexperiment, or calculation. Every law and principle must rest on\r\ninductive argument. The apostolic motto, aEurooeProve all things, hold fast\r\nthat which is good,aEuroŁ is thoroughly scientific. It is true that the mere\r\nreader of popular science must often be content to take that on\r\ntestimony which he cannot personally verify; but it is desirable that\r\neven the most cursory reader should fully comprehend the modes in which\r\nfacts are ascertained and the reasons on which conclusions are based.\r\nFailing this, he loses all the benefit of his reading in so far as\r\ntraining is concerned, and cannot have full assurance of that which he\r\nbelieves. When, therefore, we speak of life-epochs, or of links in a\r\nchain of living beings, the question is at once raisedaEuro\"What evidence\r\nhave we of the succession of such epochs? This question, with some\r\naccessory points, must engage our attention in the present chapter.\r\n\r\nGeology as a practical science consists of three leading parts. The\r\nfirst and most elementary of these is the study of the different kinds\r\nof rocks which enter into the composition of those parts of the earth\r\nwhich are accessible to us, and which we are in the habit of calling the\r\ncrust of the earth. This is the subject of _Lithology_, which is based\r\non the knowledge of minerals, and has recently become a much more\r\nprecise department of science than heretofore, owing to the successful\r\nemployment of the microscope in the investigation of the minute\r\nstructure and composition of rocks. The second is the study of the\r\narrangement of the materials of the earth on the large scale, as beds,\r\nveins, and irregular masses; and inasmuch as the greater part of the\r\nrocks known to us in the earthaEuro(TM)s crust are arranged in beds or strata,\r\nthis department may be named _Stratigraphy_. A more general name\r\nsometimes employed is that of _Petrography_. The third division of\r\ngeology relates to the remains of animals and plants buried in the rocks\r\nof the earth, and which have lived at the time when those rocks were in\r\nprocess of formation. These fossil remains introduce us to the history\r\nof life on the earth, and constitute the subject of _PalA|ontology_.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that in considering what may be learned as to epochs in the\r\nhistory of life we are chiefly concerned with the last of these\r\ndivisions. The second may also be important as a means of determining\r\nthe relative ages of the fossils. With the first we have comparatively\r\nlittle to do.\r\n\r\nPrevious to observation and inquiry, we might suppose that the kinds of\r\nanimals and plants which now inhabit the earth are those which have\r\nalways peopled it; but a very little study of fossils suffices to\r\nconvince us that vast numbers of creatures once inhabitants of this\r\nworld have become extinct, and can be known to us only by their remains\r\nburied in the earth. When we place this in connection with\r\nstratigraphical facts, we further find that these extinct species have\r\nsucceeded each other at different times, so as to constitute successive\r\ndynasties of life. On the one hand, when we know the successive ages of\r\nfossil forms, these become to us, like medals or coins to the historian,\r\nevidences of periods in the earthaEuro(TM)s history. On the other hand, we are\r\nobliged in the first instance to ascertain the ages of the medals\r\nthemselves by their position in the successive strata which have been\r\naccumulated on the surface. The series of layers which explorers like\r\nSchliemann find on the site of an ancient city, and which hold the works\r\nof successive peoples who have inhabited the place, thus present on a\r\nsmall scale a faithful picture of the succession of beds and of forms of\r\nlife on the great earth itself.\r\n\r\nOur leading criterion for estimating the relative ages of rocks is the\r\nsuperposition of their beds on each other. The beds of sandstone, shale,\r\nlimestone, and other rocks which constitute the earthaEuro(TM)s crust have\r\nnearly all been deposited thereon by water, and originally in attitudes\r\napproaching to horizontality. Hence the bed that is the lower is the\r\nolder of any two beds. Hence also, when any cutting or section reveals\r\nto us the succession of several beds, we know that fossil remains\r\ncontained in the lower beds must be of older date.\r\n\r\nWe can scarcely walk by the side of a stream which has been cutting into\r\nits banks, or at the foot of a sea-cliff, or through a road-cutting,\r\nwithout observing illustrations of this. For instance, in the section\r\nrepresented in Fig. 1, we see at the surface the vegetable soil, below\r\nthis layers of gravel and sand, below this a bed of clay, and below this\r\nhard limestone. Of these beds _a_ is the newest, _d_ the oldest; and if,\r\nfor example, we should find some marine shells in _d_, some fresh-water\r\nshells in _c_, bones of land animals and flint arrowheads in _b_, and\r\nfragments of modern pottery in _a_, we should be able at once to assign\r\ntheir relative ages to these fossils, and to form some idea of the\r\nsuccession of conditions and of life which had occurred in the locality.\r\n\r\nOn a somewhat larger scale, we have in Fig. 2 a section of the beds cut\r\nthrough by the great Fall of Niagara. All of these except that marked\r\n_a_ are very ancient marine rocks, holding fossil shells and corals, but\r\nnow forming part of the interior of a continent, and cut through by a\r\nfresh-water river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.aEuro\"Bank of stream or coast, showing stratification.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Vegetable soil.\r\n  _b_, Gravel and sand.\r\n  _c_, Clays.\r\n  _d_, Limestone rock, slightly inclined.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.aEuro\"Section at Niagara Falls, showing the strata cut\r\nthrough by the action of the Fall.

Here we have a succession of 1,500 feet of beds, some of which\r\nmust have been formed under very peculiar and exceptional conditions.\r\nThe beds of rock salt and gypsum must have been formed by the drying up\r\nof sea-water in limited basins. Those of Dolomite imply precipitation\r\nof carbonate of lime and magnesia in the sea-bottom. The marls must have\r\nbeen formed largely by the driftage of sand and clay, while some of the\r\nlimestone was produced by accumulation of corals and shells. Such\r\ndeposits must not only have been successive, but must have required a\r\nlong time for their formation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.aEuro\"Section obtained by boring with the diamond\r\ndrill, near Goderich, Ontario, Canada, in the Salina series of the Upper\r\nSilurian.

Underclay, with rootlets.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 4 we have a bed of coal and its accompaniments. The coal itself\r\nwas produced by the slow accumulation of vegetable matter on a\r\nwater-soaked soil, and this was buried under successive beds of sand and\r\nclay, now hardened into sandstone and shale, some of the beds holding\r\ntrees and reed-like plants, which still stand on the soils on which\r\nthey grew, and which must have been buried in sediment deposited in\r\ninundations or after subsidence of the land. In this section we may also\r\nobserve that the beds are somewhat inclined; and that this is not their\r\noriginal position is shown by the posture of the stems of trees, once\r\nerect, but now inclined with the beds. This leads to a consideration\r\nvery important with reference to our present subject; namely, that as\r\nour continents are mostly made up of beds deposited under water and\r\nafterwards elevated, these beds have in this process experienced such\r\ndisturbances that they rarely retain their horizontal position, but are\r\ntilted at various angles. When we follow such inclined strata over large\r\nareas, we find that they undulate in great waves or folds, forming what\r\nare called anticlinal and synclinal lines, and that the irregularities\r\nof the surface of the land depend to a great extent on these\r\nundulations, along with the projection of hard beds whose edges protrude\r\nat the surface. In point of fact, as shown in Fig. 5, mountain ranges\r\ndepend on these crumplings of the earthaEuro(TM)s crust; and the primary cause\r\nof these is probably the shrinkage of the mass of the earth owing to\r\ncontraction in cooling. When the disturbances of beds are extreme, they\r\noften cause intricacies of structure difficult to unravel; but when of\r\nmoderate extent they very much aid us in penetrating below the surface,\r\nfor we can often see a great thickness of beds rising one from beneath\r\nanother, and can thus know by mere superficial examination the structure\r\nof the earth to a great depth. It thus happens that geologists reckon\r\nthe thickness of the stratified deposits of the crust of the earth at\r\nmore than 70,000 feet, though they cannot penetrate it perpendicularly\r\nto more than a fraction of that depth. The two sections, Figs. 6 and 7,\r\nshowing the sequence of beds in England and in the northern part of\r\nNorth America, will serve, if studied by the reader, to show how, by\r\nmerely travelling over the surface and measuring the upturned edges of\r\nbeds, many thousands of feet of deposits may be observed, and their\r\nrelative ages distinctly ascertained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.aEuro\"Ideal section of the Apalachian Mountains\r\nshowing folding of the earthaEuro(TM)s crust.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Anticlinal axes.\r\n  _b_, Overturned strata.\r\n  _c_, Synclinals.\r\n  _d_, Unconformable beds.]\r\n\r\nIn studying any extensive section of rock we find that its members may\r\nmore or less readily be separated into distinct groups. Sometimes these\r\nare distinguished by what is termed unconformability, that is, the lower\r\nseries has been disturbed or inclined before the upper has been\r\ndeposited upon it. This is seen on a grand scale in the section Fig. 7,\r\nin the case of the Laurentian and Cambrian formations, and on a smaller\r\nscale in Fig. 8 in the unconformable superposition of Devonian\r\nconglomerate on Silurian slates at St. AbbaEuro(TM)s Head. In the last section\r\nit is quite evident that the beds of the lower series have been bent\r\ninto abrupt folds and worn away to a considerable extent before the\r\ndeposition of the overlying series. In such a case we know not merely\r\nthat the upper series is newer than the lower, but that some\r\nconsiderable time must have elapsed after the deposition of the one\r\nbefore the other was laid down; and we are not surprised to find that\r\nthe fossils in the groups thus unconformable to each other are very\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nBut even when the beds are conformable, they can usually be separated\r\ninto groups, depending upon differences of mineral character, or changes\r\nwhich have occurred in the mode of deposition. One group of beds, for\r\nexample, may be largely composed of limestone, another of sandstone or\r\nshale. One group may be distinguished by containing some special\r\nmineral, as, for example, rock salt or coal, while others may be\r\ndestitute of such special minerals. One group may show by its fossils\r\nthat it was deposited in the sea, others may be estuarine or\r\nlacustrine. Thus we obtain the means of dividing the rocks of the earth\r\ninto groups of different ages, known as aEurooeFormations,aEuroŁ and marking\r\nparticular periods of geological time. By tracing these formations from\r\none district or region to another, we learn the further truth that the\r\nsuccession is not merely local, but that, though liable to variation in\r\ndetail, its larger subdivisions hold so extensively that they may be\r\nregarded as world-wide in their distribution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.

Thus our knowledge of Epochs of Life, and indeed of\r\nthe whole geological history of the earth, is based on the superposition\r\nof beds in the earthaEuro(TM)s crust, and on the diversity of fossil remains in\r\nthe successive beds so superimposed on each other; and it is on these\r\ngrounds that we are enabled to construct a Table of Geological\r\nFormations representing the whole series of beds as far as known, with\r\nthe characteristic groups of fossils of each period. Here I might close\r\nthese preliminary considerations, but there are a few accessory\r\nquestions, important to our clear comprehension of the subject, which\r\nmay profitably occupy our attention for a short time.\r\n\r\nOne of these relates to the absolute duration of the time represented by\r\nthe geological history of the earth. Such estimates as our present\r\nknowledge enables us to form are very indefinite. Whether we seek for\r\nastronomical or geological data, we find great uncertainty. To such an\r\nextent is this the case, that current estimates of the time necessary to\r\nbring the earth from a state of primitive incandescence to its present\r\ncondition have varied from fifteen millions of years to five hundred\r\nmillions. Of the various modes proposed, perhaps the most satisfactory\r\nas well as instructive is that based on the rate of denudation of our\r\npresent continents, as indicated by the amount of sediment carried down\r\nby great rivers. The Mississippi, draining a vast and varied area in\r\ntemperate latitudes, is washing away the American land at the rate of\r\none foot in 6,000 years. The Ganges, in a tropical climate and draining\r\nmany mountain valleys, works at the rate of one foot in 2,358 years. The\r\nmean of these two great rivers would give one foot in 4,179 years, at\r\nwhich rate our continents would be levelled with the waters in about six\r\nmillions of years. But the land has been in process of renewal as well\r\nas of waste in geological time; and a better measure will be afforded by\r\nthe amount of beds actually deposited. The entire thickness of all the\r\nstratified rocks of Great Britain has been calculated by Ramsay at\r\n72,000 feet. Now, if we suppose the waste in all geological time to have\r\nbeen on the average the same as at present, and that this material has\r\nbeen deposited to the thickness of 72,000 feet on a belt of sea margin\r\n100 miles in width, we shall have about 86 millions of years as the time\r\nrequired.[1] This has the merit of approximating to Sir William\r\nThomsonaEuro(TM)s calculation, based on the rate of cooling of the earth, that a\r\nminimum of 100 millions of years may represent the time since a solid\r\ncrust first began to form. As it is more likely that the rate of\r\ndenudation has on the average been greater in former geological periods\r\nthan at present, we may perhaps estimate fifty or sixty millions of\r\nyears as the time required for the accumulation of all our formations.\r\nSome geologists object to this as too little, but in this some of them\r\nare influenced by the exigencies of theories of evolution, and others\r\nappear to have no adequate conception of the vast lapse of time\r\nrepresented by such numbers, in its relation to the actual rates of\r\ndenudation and deposition.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned here, however, that, on certain theories now\r\nsomewhat generally accepted, respecting the nature and source of solar\r\nheat, the absolute duration of geological time would be much reduced\r\nbelow the estimate of Sir Wm. Thomson. Prof. Tait has based on such data\r\nan estimate of fifteen millions of years. Prof. Simon Newcomb says that\r\naEurooeon the only hypothesis science will now allow us to make respecting the\r\nsource of the solar heataEuroŁ (the gravitation hypothesis of Helmholtz) aEurooethe\r\nearth was, twenty millions of years ago, enveloped in the fiery\r\natmosphere of the sun.aEuroŁ Dr. Kirkwood has called attention to these\r\nresults in connection with the planetary hypothesis of La Place, in the\r\n_Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society_.[2] Should such\r\nviews prove to be well-founded, geological calculations as to the time\r\nrequired for the successive formations may have to be revised.\r\n\r\nIf now we attempt to divide this time among the formations known to us,\r\naccording to their relative thicknesses, we have, according to an\r\nelaborate estimate of Professor Dana, the time ratios of 12, 3, and 1\r\nfor the PalA|ozoic, Mesozoic, and Cainozoic periods respectively. Taking\r\nthe whole time since the beginning of the Cambrian as forty-eight\r\nmillions of years, we should thus have for the PalA|ozoic thirty-six\r\nmillions, for the Mesozoic nine, and for the Tertiary three. Another\r\ncalculation, recently made by Professors Hull and Haughton, gives the\r\nfollowing ratios:aEuro\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Azoic                     34A.3 per cent.\r\n  PalA|ozoic                 42A.5    aEuroŁ\r\n  Mesozoic and Cainozoic    23A.2    aEuroŁ\r\n\r\n\r\nThis calculation is, however, based on the absolute thickness of the\r\nseveral series as ascertained in Great Britain, without reference to the\r\nnature of the beds, as indicating different rates of accumulation. Under\r\neither estimate it will be seen that the PalA|ozoic time greatly exceeds\r\nthe Mesozoic and Cainozoic together, and consequently that changes of\r\nlife seem to have proceeded at an accelerated rate as time wore on.\r\n\r\nAnother inquiry of some importance relates to the manner of preservation\r\nof fossils, and the extent to which they constitute the material of\r\nrocks. This inquiry is doubly important, as it bears on the genuineness\r\nof fossil remains, and on the means we have of understanding their\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nSome rocks are entirely made up of matter that once was alive, or formed\r\npart of living organisms. This is the case with some limestones, which\r\nconsist of microscopic shells, or of larger shells, corals, and similar\r\ncalcareous organisms, either entire or broken into fragments and\r\ncemented together with pasty or crystalline limestone filling their\r\ninterstices. This may be seen in Fig. 9, which represents a magnified\r\nslice of a Silurian limestone. Coal in like manner consists of\r\ncarbonised vegetable matter, retaining more or less perfectly its\r\norganic structure, and sometimes even the external forms of its\r\nconstituent parts. More frequently, fossils are dispersed more or less\r\nsparsely through the substance of beds composed of earthy matter; and\r\nthey have usually been more or less affected by chemical changes, or by\r\nmechanical pressure, or are mineralised by different substances which\r\nhave either filled their pores by infiltration or have more or less\r\ncompletely replaced their substance. Of course, as a rule, the softer\r\nand more putrescible organic matters have perished by decay, and it is\r\nonly the harder and more resisting parts that remain. Even these have\r\noften yielded to the enormous pressure to which they have been\r\nsubjected, and if at all porous, have been changed by the slow action of\r\npercolating water charged with various kinds of mineral matter in\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.aEuro\"Section of Trenton limestone, magnified, showing\r\nthat it is composed of fragments of corals, crinoids, and shells.\r\nMontreal.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.aEuro\"Diagram showing different state of\r\nfossilisation of a cell of a tabulate coral (DawsonaEuro(TM)s _Dawn of Life_).\r\n\r\n  _a_ Natural condition, wall calcite cell empty.\r\n  _b_ Wall calcite, cells filled with the same.\r\n  _c_ Walls calcite, cells filled with silica or a silicate.\r\n  _d_ Wall silicified, cells filled with calcite.\r\n  _e_ Wall silicified, cell filled with silica.]\r\n\r\nIt thus happens that many fossils are infiltrated with mineral matter.\r\nWood, for example, may have the cavities of its cells and vessels filled\r\nwith silica or silicates, with sulphide or carbonate of iron, or with\r\nlimestone, while the woody walls of the cells may remain either as coaly\r\nmatter or charcoal. I have often seen the microscopic cells of fossil\r\nwood not only filled in this way, but presenting under a high power\r\nsuccessive coats of deposit, like the banded structure of an agate.\r\n\r\nIn some cases not only are the pores filled with mineral matter, but\r\nthe solid parts themselves have been replaced, and the whole mass has\r\nactually become stone, while still retaining its original structure.\r\nThus silicified wood is often as hard and solid as agate, and under the\r\nmicroscope we see that the wood has entirely perished, and is\r\nrepresented by silica or flint, differing merely in colour from that\r\nwhich fills the cavities. In this case we may imagine the wood to have\r\nbeen acted on by water holding in solution silica, combined with soda or\r\npotash, in the manner of what is termed soluble glass. The wood, in\r\ndecay, would be converted into carbon dioxide, and this as formed would\r\nseize on the potash or soda, leaving the silica in an insoluble state,\r\nto be deposited instead of the carbon. Thus each particle of the carbon\r\nof the wood, as removed by decay, would be replaced by a particle of\r\nsilica, till the whole became stone. By similar chemical changes corals\r\nand shells are often represented by silica, or by pyrite, which has\r\ntaken the place of the original calcareous matter; and still more\r\nremarkable changes sometimes occur, as when the siliceous spicules of\r\nsponges have been replaced by carbonate of lime. The organic matter\r\npresent in the fossils greatly promotes these changes, by the substances\r\nproduced in its decay, and thus it often happens that the shells,\r\ncorals, etc., contained in limestone have been replaced by flint, while\r\nthe inclosing limestone is unchanged. Fig. 10 shows the various\r\nconditions which a coral may assume under these different modes of\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.aEuro\"Cast of erect tree (_Sigillaria_) in sandstone,\r\nstanding on a small bed of coal, South Joggins, Nova Scotia (DawsonaEuro(TM)s\r\n_Acadian Geology_).]\r\n\r\nThe substance of a fossil may be entirely removed by decay or solution,\r\nleaving a mere mould representing its external form, and this may\r\nsubsequently be filled with mineral matter, so as to produce a natural\r\ncast of the object. This is very common in the case of fossil plants;\r\nand large trunks of trees may sometimes be found represented, as seen in\r\nFig. 11, by stony pillars retaining nothing of the original wood except\r\nperhaps a portion of the bark in the state of coal. It sometimes happens\r\nthat the substance of fossils has been removed, leaving mere empty\r\ncavities, sometimes containing stony cores representing the internal\r\nchambers of the fossils. Again, calcareous fossils imbedded in hard\r\nrocks are often removed by weathering, leaving very perfect impressions\r\nof their forms. For this reason the fossil remains contained in some\r\nhard resisting rocks can be best seen as impressed moulds on the\r\nweathered surfaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.aEuro\"_Protichnites septem-notatus._ A supposed\r\nseries of crustacean footprints made in sand, now hardened into\r\nsandstone. Cambrian.aEuro\"After Logan.]\r\n\r\nLastly, we sometimes have impressions or footprints representing the\r\nlocomotion of fossil animals, rather than the fossils themselves. In\r\nthis way some extinct creatures are known to us only by their footsteps\r\non sand or clay, once soft, but now hardened into stone; and in the\r\ncase of some of the lower animals the trails thus made are often not\r\neasily interpreted (Figs. 12, 12_a_). It has been found that even\r\nsea-weeds drifted by the tide make impressions of this kind, which, when\r\nthey occur in old rocks, are very mysterious. Even rain-drops are\r\ncapable of being permanently impressed on rocks, and constitute a kind\r\nof fossils. Besides these we have many kinds of imitative markings which\r\nsimulate fossils, as those of concretions or nodules, which are often\r\nvery fantastic in shape, those of dendritic crystallisation giving\r\nmoss-like forms, and the complicated tracery produced on muddy shores\r\nby the little rills of water which follow the receding tide (Fig. 13).\r\nSuch things are often mistaken by the ignorant for fossil remains, but\r\nare easily distinguished by a practised eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12_a_.aEuro\"Footprints of modern _Limulus_, or\r\nking-crab, in the sand, which enable us to interpret those in Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\nThe reader who has followed these, perhaps somewhat dry, details, will\r\nbe rewarded for his patience by having some conception of the conditions\r\nin which we find fossil remains, and of the evidence by which we can\r\nrefer these to different periods in the history of the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.aEuro\"Current markings on shale, resembling a fossil\r\nplant. Reduced from a photograph (DawsonaEuro(TM)s _Acadian Geology_).]\r\n\r\nCarrying this knowledge with us, and at the same time glancing at the\r\ntable of successive formations prefixed to this chapter, we shall be\r\nprepared, without any additional geological study, to understand the\r\nstatements to be made in the following chapters, and to appreciate the\r\nactual nature of the succession of life in so far as it is at present\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAGNIFIED AND RESTORED SECTION OF A PORTION OF EOZOON\r\nCANADENSE.\r\n\r\nThe shaded portions show the animal matter of the Chambers, Tubuli,\r\nCanals, and Pseudopodia; the unshaded portions the calcareous\r\nskeleton.]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF LIFE ON THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day must have been when the first living being appeared for the\r\nfirst time on our planet. Was it plant or animal? or a generalised\r\norganism uniting in some mysterious way the properties and powers of two\r\nkingdoms of nature, now so distinct, and even contrary to each other in\r\ntheir manifestations? Did it appear suddenly, or was it slowly evolved\r\nfrom dead matter by some process in which the albuminous or protoplasmic\r\nmatter, which we know forms the basal substance of living beings, was\r\nfirst produced and then endowed with life? Did the first living being\r\nappear in a mature state, or was it merely a germ from which the mature\r\nindividual could be produced? These are questions which science in its\r\npresent state has no means of answering. We do not know any process by\r\nwhich the ingredients of protoplasm can be combined so as to produce\r\nthat substance without a previous living being. We do not know what\r\nmolecular differences may exist between dead albumen and that which we\r\nsee growing and moving and instinct with life; still less do we know how\r\nto set up or establish these differences. We do not know the precise\r\nnature or relation to other forces of the energy which actuates living\r\norganisms. In our experience the simplest creatures that have life\r\nspring from previous germs, themselves the products of previous\r\ngenerations of living beings. Thus we are in the presence of great\r\nmysteries which it might be impossible for us to solve, even if we were\r\npermitted to visit some new planet on which the dawn of life was\r\nbreaking.\r\n\r\nSome things, however, we can infer as to the conditions of the\r\nintroduction of life.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is every reason to believe that the earth we inhabit was\r\nonce a glowing, incandescent mass, condensing from a vaporous condition,\r\nand quite unfit for the abode of living beings, and which, even if in\r\nsome previous state its materials had constituted the mass of an\r\ninhabited world, must have lost every trace of any living germ in the\r\nfervent heat to which it had been subjected. There must, therefore, have\r\nbeen in some way an absolute creation or origination of life and\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we may infer that in the earlier stages of the earth, when it\r\nwas perhaps wholly or almost entirely covered with the waters, when it\r\nwas still uniformly warmed with its own internal heat, when it was\r\nsurrounded with a pall of dense vapours preventing radiation, and\r\nnursing its heat within itself, though in a condition entirely unsuited\r\nto the higher forms of life, it may have presented circumstances more\r\nfavourable to the origination and multiplication of living beings of low\r\norganisation than at any subsequent time. This incubation of creative\r\npower in the vaporous mantle over the primA|val ocean was a favourite\r\nimagination of old thinkers, and is not obscurely hinted at in the Book\r\nof Genesis. It has been revived and much insisted on by evolutionists in\r\nour own time, though it has no certain foundation in scientific\r\nobservation or experiment.\r\n\r\nThirdly, from the fact that plant-life alone has the power of subsisting\r\non inorganic matter, and that plants furnish all the nourishment of\r\nanimals, we may fairly infer that the life of the plant preceded that of\r\nthe animal. It has, indeed, been suggested that some of the humbler\r\nforms of life may combine in a rude and simple way enough of the powers\r\nof the plant and the animal to enable them to bridge over the double\r\ngap between the animal and the plant, and the animal and the mineral, or\r\nthat such creatures may in their early stages carry on vegetable\r\nfunctions, and in their later those of the animal. It is theoretically\r\npossible that life may have begun with such creatures, which some of the\r\nresults of microscopical research would lead us to believe still exist.\r\nIt is, however, on the whole more probable that simple plants first\r\nexisted, and furnished pabulum to animals of low grade introduced almost\r\ncontemporaneously.\r\n\r\nFourthly, all our knowledge of the succession of life leads us to\r\nbelieve that it was not the higher plants and animals that first sprang\r\ninto existence from the teeming earth, but creatures of low and humble\r\norganisation, suited to the then immature and unfinished condition of\r\nthe planet. It is also in accordance with the amazing fecundity of the\r\nseas in all geological periods in these lower forms of life, to suppose\r\nthat the earliest living things originated in the waters, and that the\r\nplants and animals of the land are of later date.\r\n\r\nDo we know anything from actual observation of this earliest population\r\nof the world? Such knowledge we can hope to acquire only by studying the\r\noldest formations known to us; and these, it must be confessed, exist in\r\na state so highly crystalline, and so much affected by internal heat, by\r\nmechanical pressure, and by movement, as to render it little likely that\r\norganic remains should be preserved in them in a state fit for\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the world, and notably in Canada and Scandinavia, as\r\nwell as in Wales, Scotland, and Bavaria, the older PalA|ozoic rocks, the\r\nlowest containing plants in great abundance, rest on still older\r\ncrystalline beds, which have become hard and crystalline in\r\npre-PalA|ozoic times, and have contributed sand and pebbles to the\r\nsucceeding very ancient deposits. These old rocksaEuro\"the Eozoic series of\r\nour tableaEuro\"may be grouped in two great systems, the Laurentian and\r\nHuronian (Fig. 14). The former may be conveniently divided into three\r\nmembers: First, the Bojian, or Ottawa gneiss, consisting of stratified\r\ngranite rocks, usually of a red colour, and of very great thickness.\r\nThis contains, so far as known, no limestone, and has afforded as yet no\r\ntrace of fossils. Secondly, the Middle Laurentian, the greater part of\r\nwhich consists of gneiss, but containing important beds of other rocks,\r\nas quartzite, iron ore, and limestone. It is in this series that we have\r\nthe first evidence of life, and it is here also that we find the\r\ngreatest abundance of carbon, in the form of graphite or plumbago, and\r\nalso large quantities of calcium phosphate, or bone earth. Thirdly, the\r\nUpper Laurentian or Norian series. This consists in great part of\r\nLabadorite, or lime feldspar, but has also beds of ordinary gneiss,\r\nlimestone, and iron ore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.aEuro\"Ideal section, showing the relations of the\r\nLaurentian and Huronian.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Lower Laurentian.\r\n  _b_, Middle Laurentian.\r\n  _c_, Upper Laurentian.\r\n  _d_, Huronian.\r\n  _e_, Cambrian and Silurian.]\r\n\r\nThe latter, the Huronian, is much less crystalline, and is divisible\r\ninto two seriesaEuro\"the Lower Huronian, which includes many beds of\r\nvolcanic origin, and the Upper Huronian, which has afforded some obscure\r\nfossils. The Huronian was first recognised by Sir W. E. Logan in Canada,\r\nbut corresponding rocks exist in Europe. The Pebidian series of Hicks in\r\nWales is probably of this age.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that much of the present appearance and condition of the\r\nmost ancient rocks may be attributed to metamorphism, that is, to the\r\nslow baking under the influence of heat, heated water, and pressure, to\r\nwhich they have been subjected in the lower parts of the earthaEuro(TM)s crust,\r\nwhen buried deeply under newer deposits. It is also true, however, as\r\nDr. Sterry Hunt has pointed out in detail, that they present mineral\r\ncharacters which show a mode of deposition different from that which has\r\nprevailed subsequently, and probably indicating great ejections of\r\nheated mineral matter into the primitive ocean, and comparatively little\r\nof that deposit therein of mere sand and clay which has prevailed in\r\nsubsequent geological periods. In short, these rocks have an\r\nunmistakably primitive aspect, distinguishing them from those of later\r\ntimes, and conveying the impression that they approach at least to the\r\nrecords of that time when a heated ocean first rested on the thin and\r\nrecently solidified crust of our planet. If this is really the case,\r\nthen our Lower LaurentianaEuro\"hard, compact, destitute of limestone, and\r\ncomposed of material which may be little else than the _dA(C)bris_ of\r\nproducts of internal heat merely spread out into bedded forms by\r\nwateraEuro\"may represent a time when no living thing as yet tenanted the\r\nwaters; and the dawn of life may have appeared in that period when the\r\nMiddle Laurentian beds were laid down. Here at least we find two kinds\r\nof evidence pointing to the existence of certain forms of life in the\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nThe first depends on the mineral character of the beds themselves. This\r\nformation holds several very thick beds of limestone. Now although this\r\nkind of rock may, under certain circumstances, be deposited directly\r\nfrom solution in water, it is not ordinarily so deposited, but more\r\nusually through the agency of living beings inhabiting the waters, and\r\nforming their skeletons or hard parts of limestone derived from the\r\nwater, usually through the medium of humble forms of plant life. In this\r\nway are formed reefs of coral and beds of shells and of chalky ooze, all\r\ncomposed of material once constituting the skeletons of animals. The\r\nstudy of limestones of all geological ages shows that this has been the\r\nusual mode of their formation. If the Laurentian limestones had a\r\nsimilar origin, the seas of that period must have swarmed with animals\r\nhaving calcareous coverings; and the study of more modern limestones\r\nwhich have become highly crystalline shows that it is quite possible\r\nthat the forms and structures of these organisms may have been\r\nobliterated.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Middle Laurentian abounds in carbon or coaly matter. True,\r\nthis is in the form of graphite or plumbago, but this condition may be a\r\nresult of metamorphism; and we know that the carbon of coal-beds and\r\nbituminous shales of much more modern times has been altered into\r\ngraphite. Further, the graphite occurs in the way in which we should\r\nexpect it to occur if of organic origin. It is found disseminated in the\r\nlimestone, just as bituminous matter is found in unaltered rocks of this\r\nkind. It is found interlaminated with gneiss, as carbonaceous and\r\nbituminous matters are found in the shales of the ordinary fossiliferous\r\nrocks, where these substances are known to be of organic origin. The\r\ngraphite also occurs in a very pure form in irregular veins, just as in\r\nsome bituminous formations the rock oil, oozing into fissures, has been\r\nhardened into asphalt or coaly matter.[3]\r\n\r\nTo these facts may be added the presence of thick beds and veins of iron\r\nore and of apatite or calcium phosphate (bone earth). Both of these\r\nsubstances occur in a disseminated state in nearly all rocks, but they\r\nare concentrated into definite deposits by the action of life. Iron is\r\nusually dissolved out and redeposited by acids produced in the decay of\r\nvegetable matter, as we see in the clay ironstones of the coal formation\r\nand in bog-iron ores. Calcic phosphate is taken up by many animals, and\r\nforms their shells or skeletons, and on their death is deposited in beds\r\non the sea-bottom, sometimes to a very considerable extent.\r\n\r\nThe concurrence of all these phenomena in the Middle Laurentian may be\r\nheld to afford a strong presumption that, could we discover these rocks\r\nin an unaltered state, we should find the limestones filled with marine\r\nfossils and the graphite showing the forms or structure of plants. The\r\nonly startling feature in this conclusion is, that if we admit it, we\r\nmust also admit that life was developed in the Laurentian time in an\r\nexuberance not surpassed, if equalled, in any subsequent period. Still,\r\nthere is nothing incredible in this, for if the forms of life were few\r\nand low, their increase may have been rapid, because unchecked; and they\r\nno doubt found in the ancient seas a surplusage of material on which to\r\nfeed and with which to construct their skeletons. Dr. Hunt has estimated\r\nthat the amount of carbon now sealed up as coaly matter would, if\r\ndiffused in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, afford 600 times the\r\nquantity of that gas at present floating in the air. A still more vast\r\namount is sealed up in the limestone of the several geological\r\nformations. The same chemist has shown that the quantity of lime held in\r\nsolution in the ocean must have been much greater in Laurentian times\r\nthan at present. These facts at least allow us to suppose that in the\r\nEozoic times there were great supplies of carbon and of lime available\r\nto such creatures of low organisation as were capable of profiting by\r\nthem; and we have no reason to doubt that there may have been plants and\r\nanimals so constituted as to flourish in conditions of this kind, in\r\nwhich perhaps scarcely any modern species could exist.\r\n\r\nThese probabilities have caused geologists anxiously to search for any\r\ntraces of fossil organic remains in the old Laurentian rocks; and they\r\nhave been rewarded by the discovery of one species, _Eozoon Canadense_,\r\nstill often referred to as only a problematical fossil; but this arises\r\nto a large extent from the prevalent want of knowledge sufficient to\r\nappreciate the evidence for its organic character. This being once\r\nadmitted, we have in the existence of _Eozoon_ alone a sufficient cause\r\nfor the accumulation of much of the Laurentian limestone, though there\r\nis reason to believe that it was not the only inhabitant of those\r\nancient seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15 (Nos. 1 to 4).aEuro\"Small weathered specimen of\r\n_Eozoon_. From Petite Nation.\r\n\r\n1, Natural size; showing general form, and acervuline portion above and\r\nlaminated portion below. 2, Enlarged casts of cells from upper part. 3,\r\nEnlarged casts of cells from the lower part of the acervuline portion.\r\n4, Enlarged casts of sarcode layers from the laminated part.]\r\n\r\nThe best specimens of _Eozoon_ occur as rounded, flattened, or more or\r\nless irregular lumps or masses in certain layers of the Laurentian\r\nlimestone. When weathered on the surface of the rock, these lumps show a\r\nregular concentric lamination, caused by thin fibres of limestone,\r\nalternating with other mineral substances, filling up the spaces between\r\nthem. When these intervening layers are composed of such minerals as\r\nSerpentine, Loganite, Pyroxene, or Dolomite, which are more resisting\r\nthan the limestone, they project when weathered, or when the limestone\r\nis etched by an acid, so as to show the lamination very distinctly. At\r\nthe lower surface of the masses the layers are seen to be thicker than\r\nthey are above, and in perfect specimens they are seen toward the\r\nsurface to break up into small rounded vesicles of calcite, like little\r\nbubbles, which constitute the so-called acervuline condition of _Eozoon_\r\n(Fig. 15, No. 2). Slices of the fossil etched with an acid show these\r\nappearances very perfectly, and can even be printed from, so as to\r\npresent perfect nature-prints of the structure (Fig. 16).\r\n\r\nFIG. 16.aEuro\"Nature-printed specimen of _Eozoon_ slightly etched with acid.\r\nIt shows the lamination, and at one side fragmental _Eozoon_ (_LifeaEuro(TM)s Dawn\r\non Earth_).\r\n\r\nOn etching a small fragment or slice with very dilute acid, so as to\r\ndissolve away the calcite slowly, if the specimen be well preserved, we\r\nfind that the calcite layers have a very curious structure. This is\r\nindicated by the appearance of little white or transparent threads of\r\nSerpentine, Dolomite, or Pyroxene, which ramify throughout the substance\r\nof the limestone layers, and are left intact when they have been\r\ndissolved. These little processes must originally have been pores in the\r\nlimestone layers, which have been filled with the substance which\r\nconstitutes the alternate laminA|. In addition to this, if we use a\r\nsomewhat high microscopic power, and especially if we study the\r\nstructures as seen in thin transparent slices, we can perceive a still\r\nfiner tubulation along the sides of the calcite layers, represented by\r\nextremely minute parallel rods of mineral matter (Figs. 17, 18).\r\n\r\nNow if we regard these structures as those of an infiltrated fossil, as\r\ndescribed in last chapter, their interpretation will not be difficult.\r\nThe original organism was composed of calcareous matter in thin\r\nconcentric laminA|, connected with each other by pillars and plates of\r\nsimilar material. Between these laminA| was lodged the soft, jelly-like\r\nsubstance of a marine animal, growing by the addition of successive\r\nlayers, each protected by a thin calcareous crust. The layers were\r\noriginally traversed by very numerous parallel tubuli, permitting the\r\nsoft protoplasm to penetrate them; and when, in the progress of growth,\r\nit was necessary to strengthen these layers, they were thickened by a\r\nsupplemental deposit traversed by larger and ramifying canals. When the\r\nanimal was dead, and its soft parts removed by decay, the chambers\r\nbetween the laminA|, as well as the minute canals and tubuli, became\r\ninfiltrated with mineral matter, in the manner described in the last\r\nchapter, and when so preserved became absolutely imperishable under any\r\ncircumstances short of absolute fusion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.aEuro\"Magnified group of canals in supplemental\r\nskeleton of _Eozoon_.\r\n\r\nTaken from the specimen in which they were first recognised (_LifeaEuro(TM)s\r\nDawn on Earth_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.aEuro\"Portion of _Eozoon_ magnified 100 diameters,\r\nshowing the original cell-wall with tubulation, and the supplemental\r\nskeleton with canals.aEuro\"After Carpenter.\r\n\r\n_a_, Original tubulated wall or aEurooeNummuline layer.aEuroŁ More magnified in\r\nFig. A. _b_, _c_, Intermediate skeleton, with canals.]\r\n\r\nThis interpretation leads to the conclusion, at which I arrived from the\r\nstudy of the first well-preserved specimen ever submitted to microscopic\r\nexamination, that the animal which produced the calcareous skeleton of\r\n_Eozoon_ was a member of that lowest grade of Protozoa known as\r\nForaminifera; and which, after living through the whole of geological\r\ntime, still abound in the sea. The main differences are, that _Eozoon_\r\npresents a somewhat generalised structure, intermediate between two\r\nmodern types, and that it attained to a gigantic size compared with most\r\nof these organisms in later periods. How near it approaches in structure\r\nto some modern forms may be seen by comparison of the recent species\r\nrepresented in Fig. 19, in which the parts corresponding to the\r\nchambers, laminA|, tubuli, and canals of _Eozoon_ can be readily\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.aEuro\"Magnified portion of shell of _Calcarina_.aEuro\"After\r\nCarpenter.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Cells.\r\n  _b_, Original cell-wall with tubuli.\r\n  _c_, Supplementary skeleton with canals.]\r\n\r\nThe modern animals of this group are wholly composed of soft gelatinous\r\nprotoplasm or sarcode, the outer layer of which is usually somewhat\r\ndenser than the inner portion; but both are structureless, except that\r\nthe inner layer may present a more or less distinct granular\r\nappearance. Many of them show a distinct spot or cell, called the\r\nnucleus, and some have minute transparent vesicles, which contract and\r\nexpand alternately, and appear to be of the nature of circulatory or\r\nexcretory organs. They have no proper alimentary canal, but receive\r\ntheir food into the general mass and digest it in temporary cavities.\r\nTheir means of locomotion and prehension are soft thread-like or\r\nfinger-like processes, extended at will from the surface of any part of\r\nthe body, and known as false feet (pseudopodia). From these processes\r\nthe whole group has obtained the name of Rhizopods, or rootfooted\r\nanimals. They may be regarded as constituting the simplest and humblest\r\nform of animal life certainly known to us.\r\n\r\nThe very numerous species of these creatures existing in the waters of\r\nthe modern world may be arranged under three principal groups. The first\r\nand highest includes those which have lobate or finger-like pseudopods,\r\nand a well-developed nucleus and pulsating vesicle (Fig. 20, _a_). They\r\nare mostly inhabitants of fresh water, and destitute of a hard crust or\r\nshell. A second group, including many inhabitants of the sea as well as\r\nof fresh waters, has thread-like radiating pseudopodia[4] (Fig. 20 _b_).\r\nSome of these form beautiful silicious skeletons. A third group,\r\nessentially marine, consists of those with reticulated pseudopodia, and\r\nusually destitute of distinct nucleus and pulsating vesicle (Fig. 21).\r\nThey produce beautiful calcareous skeletons, often very complex, or\r\nsometimes are content to cover themselves with a crust of agglutinated\r\ngrains of sand. It is to this last group that _Eozoon_ belongs, and to the\r\nhighest division of itaEuro\"that which has the shell perforated with minute\r\npores, often of two kinds. It is curious that just as we have the\r\nchambers and pores of _Eozoon_ filled with serpentine, so in all\r\ngeological formations and in the modern seas it is not uncommon to find\r\nForaminifera having their cavities filled with glauconite and other\r\nhydrous silicates allied to serpentine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.aEuro\"_a_, _AmA\"ba_, a fresh-water naked Rhizopod; and\r\n_b_, _Actinophrys_, a fresh-water Protozoon of the group Radiolaria,\r\n        with thread-like pseudopodia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.aEuro\"_Nonionina_, a modern marine Foraminifer.\r\nShowing its chambered shell and netted pseudopodia.aEuro\"After Carpenter.]\r\n\r\nIf we attempt to trace the Rhizopods onward from the Middle Laurentian,\r\nwe are met with a great hiatus in the Upper Laurentian. The species\r\n_Eozoon Bavaricum_ has, however, been found in rocks apparently of\r\nHuronian age; but this is the last known appearance of _Eozoon_, properly\r\nso-called. In the Cambrian or Siluro-Cambrian, however, we meet with\r\nmany gigantic Protozoa, more especially those known as _Stromatopora_,\r\n_ArchA|ocyathus_, _Receptaculites_, and _Cryptozoon_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.aEuro\"_Stromatopora concentrica._aEuro\"After Hall.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Section of the same, magnified.\r\n  _b_, Small portion highly magnified, showing laminA| and pillars.]\r\n\r\nThe typical StromatoporA|, or Layer-corals, consist, like _Eozoon_, of\r\nconcentric layers, connected by numerous pillars, which are often,\r\nthough not always, more definite and regular than in the Laurentian\r\nfossil. The laminA| are perforated, but more coarsely than in _Eozoon_, and\r\nthey are often thickened with supplemental deposit which, in some of the\r\nforms, presents canals radiating from vertical tubes or bundles of tubes\r\npenetrating the mass (Figs. 22, 23). The mode of growth of _Stromatopora_\r\nmust have closely resembled that of _Eozoon_, and the forms produced are\r\nso similar that it is often quite impossible to distinguish them by the\r\nnaked eye. Like _Eozoon_, they form the substance of important limestones,\r\nand single masses are sometimes found as much as three feet in diameter.\r\nThe StromatoporA| extend from the Upper Cambrian to the Devonian\r\ninclusive. In the Carboniferous they are continued by smaller and more\r\nregular organisms of the genus _Loftusia_,[5] and this genus seems to\r\nextend without marked change up to the Eocene Tertiary. Recent students\r\nof the StromatoporA| seem disposed to promote them from the province of\r\nProtozoa to that of the Hydroids.[6] The reasons for this seem cogent in\r\nthe case of some of the forms, but in my judgment fail in others, more\r\nespecially in the older forms. It may ultimately be found that the group\r\nas now held includes very different types of structure. In modern times\r\nI know of no nearer representative than the animal whose skeleton often\r\nadheres in red encrusting patches to our specimens of corals, and which\r\nis known as _Polytrema_. In general structure it is not very far from\r\nbeing a very degenerate kind of _Stromatopora_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.aEuro\"_Caunopora planulata._ Showing the radiating\r\ncanals on a weathered surface. Devonian.aEuro\"After Hall.]\r\n\r\nIt is curious that in the line of succession above stated, the beautiful\r\ntubulated cell-wall of _Eozoon_ disappears; and this structure seems,\r\nafter the Laurentian, to be for ever divorced from the great laminated\r\nProtozoans. It reappears in the Carboniferous, in certain smaller\r\norganisms of the type of the _Nummulites_, or Money-stone Foraminifers,\r\nand is continued in this group of smaller and free animals down to the\r\npresent time. In the Cretaceous and early Tertiary periods, the\r\nForaminifera of different types have been nearly as great rock-builders\r\nas they were in the Laurentian. Some of these later rock-builders,\r\nhowever, have belonged to the lower or imperforate group; others to the\r\nhigher or Rotaline and Nummuline groups; and, as a whole, they have been\r\nindividually small, making up in numbers what they lacked in size.\r\nProbably the conditions for enabling animals of this type rapidly, and\r\non a large scale, to collect calcareous matter, were more favourable in\r\nthe Laurentian than they have ever been since.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.aEuro\"_ArchA|ocyathus minganensis._ A Primordial\r\nProtozoon.aEuro\"After Billings.\r\n\r\n_a_, Pores of the inner wall.]\r\n\r\nIn the Siluro-Cambrian age two other forms of gigantic Foraminiferal\r\nProtozoans were introduced, widely different from _Eozoon_, and destined\r\napparently not to survive the period in which they appeared. These were\r\n_ArchA|ocyathus_, the ancient Cup-corals, and Receptaculites, which may\r\nperhaps be called the Sack-corals. Both are quite remote from _Eozoon_ in\r\nstructure, wanting its complexity in the matter of minute tubules, and\r\nhaving greater regularity and complication on the large scale.\r\n_ArchA|ocyathus_ had the form of a hollow inverted cone with double\r\nperforated walls, connected by radiating irregular plates, also\r\nperforated (Fig. 24). It has been regarded as a sponge, and some species\r\nare certainly accompanied with spicules; but these I have ascertained to\r\nbe merely accidental, and will be referred to in the next chapter. The\r\ntrue structure of _ArchA|ocyathus_ consists of radiating calcareous plates\r\nenclosing chambers connected by pores. ArchA|ocyathus came in with the\r\nLater Cambrian, and seems to have died out in the Siluro-Cambrian. The\r\nonly more modern things which at all resemble it are the Foraminifera\r\ncalled _Dactylopora_, which belong to the Tertiary period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.aEuro\"Receptaculites. Restored.aEuro\"After Billings.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Aperture.\r\n  _b_, Inner wall.\r\n  _c_, Outer wall.\r\n  _n_, Nucleus, or primary chamber.\r\n  _v_, Internal cavity.]\r\n\r\nReceptaculites is a still more complex organism. It has a sack-like\r\nform, often attaining a large size, and the double walls are composed of\r\nsquare or rhombic plates, connected with each other by hollow tubes from\r\nwhich proceed canals perforating the plates (Fig. 25). This curious\r\nstructure is confined to the Siluro-Cambrian, and is so dissimilar from\r\nmodern forms that its affinities have been subject to grave doubts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.aEuro\"Section of _Loftusia Persica_. An Eocene\r\nForaminifer. Magnified five diameters.aEuro\"After Carpenter and Brady.]\r\n\r\nWe thus have presented to us the remarkable fact that in the PalA|ozoic\r\nage we have no precise representative of _Eozoon_, but instead three\r\ndivergent types, differing from it and from each other, all apparently\r\nspecialised to particular uses, all temporary in their duration; while\r\nin later times nature seems to have returned nearer to the type of\r\n_Eozoon_, though on a smaller scale, and separating some characters\r\nconjoined in it. Some portion of this curious result may be due to our\r\nignorance; and it would be interesting to know, what we may know some\r\nday, how this type of life was represented in the long interval between\r\nthe Huronian and the Upper Cambrian, when perhaps there may have been\r\nforms that would at least enable us to connect _Eozoon_ and _Stromatopora_.\r\n\r\nAnother link in the chain of being remains to be noticed here. In the\r\nLaurentian limestones we meet with numerous minute spherical bodies and\r\ngroups of spheres with calcareous tubulated tests.[7] These may either\r\nbe small ForaminiferA|, distinct from _Eozoon_, or may be germs or detached\r\ncells from its surface. Similar bodies are found in the lower part of\r\nthe Siluro-Cambrian, in the Quebec group at Point Levis; and there they\r\nare filled with a species of glauconite constituting a sort of greensand\r\nrock. Still higher, in the Carboniferous, there are very numerous\r\nspecies of Foraminifera, presenting forms very similar to those in the\r\nmodern seas, so that in the smaller shells of this group we seem to have\r\nevidence of a continuous series all the way from the Laurentian to the\r\npresent time. The greater laminated forms co-exist with these up to the\r\nEocene Tertiary. Throughout the whole of geological timeaEuro\"from the\r\nformation of the Laurentian limestones to that of the chalky ooze\r\naccumulating in the modern oceanaEuro\"these humble creatures have been among\r\nthe chief instruments in seizing on the calcareous matter of the waters\r\nand depositing it in the form of limestone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.aEuro\"Foraminiferal Rock Builders, in the Cretaceous\r\nand Eocene.\r\n\r\n_a_, _Nummulites lA|vigata_aEuro\"Eocene. _b_, The same, showing chambered\r\ninterior. _c_, Milioline limestone, magnifiedaEuro\"Eocene, Paris. _d_, Hard\r\nChalk, section magnifiedaEuro\"Cretaceous.]\r\n\r\nI have said nothing of the development of higher forms of animal life\r\nfrom _Eozoon_, simply because I know nothing of it. We shall see in the\r\nnext chapter that these are introduced seemingly in an independent\r\nmanner. We may be content to trace foraminiferal life along its own line\r\nof development, waxing and waning, but ever confined within the same\r\ngeneral boundaries, from the Laurentian to the present time. It is\r\nlikely that if, in any of the ages constituting this vast lapse of time,\r\na dredge had been dropped into the depths of ocean, it would have\r\nbrought up Foraminifera not essentially different in form and structure.\r\nIf any one asks to what extent the successive species constituting this\r\nalmost endless chain may be descendants one of the other, we have no\r\nabsolutely certain information to give. On the one hand, it is not\r\ninconceivable that such forms as _Stromatopora_ or _Nummulina_ may have\r\ndescended from _Eozoon_. On the other hand, it is equally conceivable that\r\nthe same power which produced _Eozoon_ at first, whether from dead matter\r\nor from some unknown lower form of life, may have repeated the process\r\nin later times with modifications. In any case it is probable that the\r\nForaminifera have experienced alternations of expansion and shrinkage,\r\nof elevation and decadence, in the lapse of geological time. There were\r\ntimes in which many new forms swarmed into existence, and times in which\r\nold forms were becoming extinct without being replaced by others. In so\r\nfar as the areas of the continents and the adjacent waters are\r\nconcerned, those periods when the land was subsiding under the ocean\r\nmust have been their times of prosperity, those in which the crust of\r\nthe earth shrunk and raised up large areas of land must have been their\r\ntimes of decay. Still this lowest form of animal life has never\r\nperished, but has always found abundant place for itself, however\r\npressed by physical change and by the introduction of higher beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Paradoxides Regina_ (Matthews). Lower Cambrian of New\r\nBrunswick.\r\n\r\n1/6th Nat. Size.]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF INVERTEBRATES OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the middle portion of the Laurentian age was really a time of\r\nexuberant and abounding life, either this met with strange reverses in\r\nsucceeding periods, or the conditions of preservation have been such as\r\nto prevent us from tracing its onward history. Certain it is, that\r\naccording to present appearances we have a new beginning in the\r\nCambrian, which introduces the great PalA|ozoic age, and few links of\r\nconnection are known between this and the previous Eozoic.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the PalA|ozoic we have reason to believe that our\r\ncontinents were slowly subsiding under the sea, after a period of\r\ngeneral continental elevation which was consequent on the crumbling of\r\nthe earthaEuro(TM)s crust at the close of the Eozoic; and on the new sea-bottoms\r\nformed by this subsidence came in, slowly at first, but in\r\never-increasing swarms, the abundant and varied life of the early\r\nPalA|ozoic.\r\n\r\nIn the oldest portion of the Cambrian series in Wales, Hicks has\r\ncatalogued species of no less than seventeen genera, embracing\r\nCrustaceans, the representatives of our crabs and lobsters, bivalve and\r\nunivalve shell-fishes of different types, worms, sea-stars, zoophytes,\r\nand sponges. If we could have walked on the shores of the old Cambrian\r\nsea, or cast our dredge or trawl into its depths, we should have found\r\nrepresentatives of most of the humbler forms of sea life still extant,\r\nthough of specific forms strange to us. Perhaps the nearest approach to\r\nsuch experience which we can make is to examine the group of Cambrian\r\nanimals delineated in Fig. 28, and to notice, under the guidance of the\r\ngeologist above named, the sections seen at St. DavidaEuro(TM)s, in South Wales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.aEuro\"Group of Cambrian Animals (from Nicholson).\r\n\r\n_a_, _Arenicolites didymus_, worm tubes. _b_, _Lingulella ferruginea_.\r\n_c_, _Theca Davidii_. _d_, _Modiolopsis solvensis_. _e_, _Orthis\r\nHicksii_. _f_, _Obolella sagittalis_. _g_, _Hymenocaris vermicauda_.\r\n_h_, Trilobite, _Olenus micrurus_.]\r\n\r\nHere we find a nucleus of ancient rocks supposed to be Laurentian,\r\nthough in mineral character more nearly akin to the Huronian, but which\r\nhave hitherto afforded no trace of fossils. Resting unconformably on\r\nthese is a series of partially altered rocks, regarded as Lower\r\nCambrian, and also destitute of organic remains. These have a thickness\r\nof almost 1,000 feet, and they are succeeded by 3,000 feet more of\r\nsimilar rocks, still classed as Lower Cambrian, but which have afforded\r\nfossils. The lowest bed which contains indications of life is a red\r\nshale, perhaps a deep-sea bed, and possibly itself partly of organic\r\norigin, by that strange process of decomposition or dissolution of\r\nforaminiferal ooze and volcanic fragments, going on in the depths of the\r\nmodern ocean, and described by Dr. Wyville Thomson as occurring over\r\nlarge areas in the South Pacific. The species are two _LingulellA|_, a\r\n_Discina_ and a _Leperditia_. Supposing these to be all, it is\r\nremarkable that we have no Protozoa or Corals or Echinoderms, and that\r\nthe types of Brachiopods and Crustaceans are of comparatively modern\r\naffinities. Passing upward through another 1,000 feet of barren\r\nsandstone, we reach a zone in which no less than five genera of\r\nTrilobites are found, along with Pteropods and a sponge. Thus it is that\r\nlife comes in at the base of the Cambrian in Wales, and it may be\r\nregarded as a fair specimen of the facts as they appear in the earlier\r\nfossiliferous beds succeeding the Laurentian. Taking the first of these\r\ngroups of fossils, we may recognise in the _Leperditia_ a two-valved\r\nCrustacean closely allied to forms still living in the seas and fresh\r\nwaters. The LingulellA|, whether we regard them as molluscoids, or, with\r\nProfessor Morse, as singularly specialised worms, represent a peculiar\r\nand distinct type, handed down, through all the vicissitudes of the\r\ngeological ages, to the present day. The Pteropods and the sponge are\r\nvery similar to forms now living. The Trilobites are an extinct group,\r\nbut closely allied to some modern Crustaceans. Had the primordial life\r\nbegun with species altogether inscrutable and unexampled in succeeding\r\nages, this would no doubt have been mysterious; but next to this is the\r\nmystery of the oldest forms of life being also among the newest.\r\nWhatever the origin of these creatures, they represent families which\r\nhave endured till now in the struggle for existence without either\r\nelevation or degradation. Yet, though thus vast in their duration, they\r\nseem to have swarmed in together and in great numbers, in the Cambrian,\r\nwithout any previous preparation. From the Cambrian onward, throughout\r\nthe whole PalA|ozoic, there is no decided break in the continuity of\r\nmarine life; and already in the Silurian period the sea was tenanted\r\nwith all the forms of invertebrate life it yet presents, and these in a\r\nteeming abundance not surpassed in any succeeding age. Let us now, in\r\naccordance with our plan, select some of these ancient inhabitants of\r\nthe waters and trace their subsequent history.\r\n\r\nRemains of sea-weeds are undoubtedly present in the Cambrian rocks. One\r\nof the lowest beds in Sweden has been named from their abundance the\r\nFucoidal Sandstone; and wherever fossiliferous Cambrian rocks occur,\r\nsome traces, more or less obscure, of these plants may be found. Nearly\r\nall that we can say of them, however, is, that, in so far as their\r\nremains give any information, they are very like the plants of the same\r\ngroup that now abound in our seas. In the fucoidal sandstone of Sweden\r\ncertain striated or ribbed bodies have been found, which have even been\r\nregarded as land plants;[8] but they seem rather to be trails or marks\r\nleft by sea-weeds dragged by currents over a muddy bottom. The plants of\r\nthe sea thus precede those of the land, and they begin on the same level\r\nas to structure that they have since maintained. I agree with Nathorst,\r\nhowever, in holding that the Bilobites and many other forms believed by\r\nsome to be sea-weeds, are really trails and tracks of animals.[9]\r\n\r\nThe Foraminifera of the PalA|ozoic we have noticed in the last chapter;\r\nbut we now find a new type of ProtozoanaEuro\"that of the Sponge. Sponges as\r\nthey exist at present may be defined to be composite animals, made up of\r\na great number of one-celled or gelatinous zoids, provided with\r\nvibrating threads or cilia, and so arranged that currents of water are\r\ndriven through passages or canals in the mass, by the action of the\r\ncilia, bringing food and aerated water for respiration. To support these\r\nsoft sarcodic sponge-masses, they secrete fibres of horny matter and\r\nneedles (spiculA|) of flint or of limestone, forming complicated fibrous\r\nand spicular skeletons, often of great beauty. They abound in all seas,\r\nand some species are found in fresh waters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.aEuro\"Portion of skeleton of Hexactinellid Sponge\r\n(_CA\"loptychium_). Magnified. After Zittel.]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a very few species destitute of skeleton, and\r\nwhich we cannot expect to find in a fossil state, the sponges may be\r\nroughly divided into three groups: 1, those with corneous or horny\r\nskeleton, like our common washing sponges; 2, those with skeletons\r\ncomposed of silicious needles of various forms and arrangement; 3, those\r\nwith calcareous spicules. Of these, the second or silicious group has\r\nprecedence in point of time, beginning in the Early Cambrian, and\r\ncontinuing to the present. Two of its subdivisions are especially\r\ninteresting in their range. The first is that of the Lattice-sponges\r\n(_HexactinellidA|_), in which the spicules have six rays placed at right\r\nangles, and are attached to each other by their points, so as to form a\r\nvery regular network (Fig. 29). The second is that of the Stone-sponges\r\n(_LithistidA|_), in which the spicules are four-rayed or irregular, and\r\nare united by the branching root-like ends of the rays. The most\r\nbeautiful of all sponges, the Venus Flower-basket (_Euplectella_), is a\r\nmodern Hexactinellid, and the wonderful weaving of its spicules is as\r\nmarvellous a triumph of constructive skill as its general form is\r\ngraceful. The Lithistids are less beautiful, but are the densest and\r\nmost compact of sponges, and are represented by several species in the\r\nmodern seas. Both of these types go back to the Early Cambrian, and have\r\ncontinued side by side to the present day, as representatives of two\r\ndistinct geometrical methods for the construction of a spicular\r\nskeleton.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.aEuro\"_Protospongia fenestrata_ (Salter).

From the Cambrian of Labrador.]\r\n\r\nMany years ago the keen eye of the late lamented Salter detected in a\r\nstain on the surface of a slab of Cambrian slate the remains of a\r\nsponge; and minute examination showed that its spicules crossed each\r\nother, and formed lattice-work on the hexactinellid plan. Salter boldly\r\nnamed it _Protospongia_ (the first sponge), and it is still the earliest\r\nthat we know (Fig. 30). Thus the type whose skeleton is the most perfect\r\nin a mechanical point of view takes the lead. It is continued in the\r\nSilurian in many curious forms, of which the stalkless sponges\r\n(_Astylospongia_) are the most common (Fig. 31). It perhaps attains its\r\nmaximum in the Cretaceous, from which the beautiful example in Fig. 29\r\nis taken, and it still flourishes, giving us the most beautiful of all\r\nrecent forms. Before the close of the Cambrian there were other sponges\r\nof the Lithistid type. Fig. 32 represents a group of spicules from the\r\nCalciferous (Lowest Silurian or Upper Cambrian) of Mingan,[10] and which\r\nprobably belong to a large Lithistid sponge of that early time. The\r\nLithistids have been recognised in the Upper Silurian and Carboniferous,\r\nand continuing upward to the Cretaceous, there become vastly numerous,\r\nwhile their modern representatives are by no means few. The silicious\r\nsponges with simple spicules appear to have existed as far back as the\r\nSiluro-Cambrian, and there is believed to be almost as early evidence of\r\nhorny or corneous sponges. The calcareous sponges have been recognised\r\nas far back as the Silurian.[11] Thus from the close of the PalA|ozoic\r\nall the types of sponges seem to have existed side by side; and in the\r\nCretaceous period, when such large areas of our continents were deeply\r\nsubmerged, they attained a wonderful development, perhaps not equalled\r\nin any other era of the earthaEuro(TM)s history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.aEuro\"_Oldhamia antiqua_ (Forbes).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.aEuro\"_Dictyonema sociale_. Enlarged. _Lingula_\r\nflags.aEuro\"After Salter.]\r\n\r\nSponges may be regarded as the highest or most complex of the Protozoa\r\nor the lowest of the Coelenterates. We have no links wherewith to\r\nconnect them with the lower Protozoa of the Eozoic period; and through\r\ntheir long history, though very numerous in genera and species, they\r\nshow no closer relationship with the Foraminifera below, and the Corals\r\nabove, than do their successors in the modern seas. They thus stand very\r\nmuch apart; and modern studies of their development and minute\r\nstructures do not seem to remove them from this isolation. Though we are\r\ntreating here of inhabitants of the sea, it may be proper to mention\r\nthat Geinitz has described two species from the Permian which he\r\nbelieved to be early precursors of the SpongillA|, or fresh-water\r\nsponges; but more recently he seems to regard them as probably AlgA|.\r\nYoung has, however, recently found true spicules of _Spongilla_ in the\r\nPurbeck beds.[12]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.aEuro\"_Dictyonema Websteri_ (Dn).

Bryozoan.\r\nSiluro-Cambrian.]\r\n\r\nA stage higher than the sponges are those little polyp-like animals with\r\nsac-like bodies and radiating arms or tentacles, which form minute horny\r\nor calcareous cells, and bud out into branching communities, looking to\r\nuntrained eyes like delicate sea-weedsaEuro\"the sea-firs and sea-mosses of\r\nour coasts (Fig. 36). These belong to a very old group, for in the\r\noldest Cambrian we have a form referred to this type (Fig. 33), and in\r\nthe Upper Cambrian another still more decided example (Fig. 34).[13]\r\nThis style of life, once introduced, must have increased in variety and\r\nextended itself with amazing rapidity, for in the Siluro-Cambrian age we\r\nfind it already as characteristic as in our modern seas, and so abundant\r\nthat vast thicknesses of shale are filled and blackened with the\r\n_dA(C)bris_ of forms allied to the sea-firs, and masses of limestone\r\nlargely made up of the more calcareous forms of the sea-mosses. As\r\nexamples of the former we may take the _Graptolites_, so named from\r\ntheir resemblance to lines of writing, and of which several forms are\r\nrepresented in Fig. 37. The little teeth on the sides of these were\r\ncells, inhabited probably by polyps, like those represented in the\r\nmodern _Sertularia_ in Fig. 36. Some of them were probably attached to\r\nthe bottom. In others the branches radiated from a central film which\r\nmay have been a hollow vesicle or float, enabling them to live at the\r\nsurface of the water (Fig. 38). These Graptolites are specially\r\ncharacteristic of the Upper Cambrian and Lower Silurian. The netted ones\r\n(_Dictyonema_), as may be seen from Figs. 34 and 35, came in before the\r\nclose of the Cambrian, and continue unchanged to the Silurian, where\r\nthey disappear. The branching forms, seen in Fig. 37, have scarcely so\r\ngreat a range. They thus form most certain marks of the period to which\r\nthey belong, and being oceanic and probably floaters, they diffused\r\nthemselves so rapidly that they appear to indicate the same geological\r\ntime in countries so widely separated as Europe, North America, and\r\nAustralia. It is curious, too, that while the Graptolites thus mark a\r\ndefinite geological time, and seem to disappear abruptly and without\r\napparent cause, they are the first link in the long chain of the\r\nHydroids, which, though under different family forms, continue to this\r\nday, apparently neither better nor worse than their perished PalA|ozoic\r\nrelatives. There is a group of little Stony Corals (_MonticuliporidA|_),\r\nwhich were possibly also the cells of Hydroids, that have a similar\r\nhistory. They are the only known Corals that date so far back as the\r\nUpper Cambrian; and they continue under very similar forms all through\r\nthe PalA|ozic, and are represented by the millepore corals of the present\r\nday. Fig. 40 represents a form found at the base of the Siluro-Cambrian,\r\nand Fig. 41 shows forms characteristic of the Carboniferous Limestone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39_a_.aEuro\"_Fenestella Lyelli_ (Dawson). A\r\nCarboniferous Bryozoan.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.aEuro\"_Chaetetes fibrosa_. A tubulate coral with\r\nmicroscopic cells. Siluro-Cambrian.]\r\n\r\nIf we turn now to the sea-mosses (Bryozoa), we have a group of minute\r\npolyp-like animals inhabiting cells not unlike those of the Hydroids,\r\nand which form plant-like aggregates. But the animals themselves are so\r\ndifferent in structure that they are considered to be nearer allies of\r\nthe bivalve shell-fishes than of the Corals. They are, in short, so\r\ndifferent, that the most ardent evolutionist would scarcely hold a\r\ncommunity of origin between them and such creatures as the Graptolites\r\nand Millepores, though an ordinary observer might readily confound the\r\none with the other. These animals appear at the beginning of the\r\nSiluro-Cambrian, and such forms as that represented in Fig. 39, very\r\nclosely allied to some now living, are large constituents of some of the\r\nlimestones of that period. Other forms, like that represented in Fig.\r\n39_a_, are very characteristic of the Carboniferous. These animals,\r\nindividually small, though complicated in structure and branching into\r\ncommunities, scarcely ever of any great magnitude, humble creatures\r\nwhich have never played any great part in the world, have, nevertheless,\r\nbeen so persistent that, though specific and generic forms have been\r\nchanged, the group may be said to be in the modern seas exactly what it\r\nwas in those of the early PalA|ozoic, nor can it be affirmed to have\r\noriginated in anything different, or to have produced anything.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.aEuro\"_a_, _Stenopora exilis_ (Dawson). _b_,\r\n_Chaetetes tumidus_ (Edwards and Haine). Carboniferous.]\r\n\r\nThe true Stony Corals (_Anthozoa_) are as yet unknown in the Cambrian.\r\nThey entered on the stage in immense abundance in the Siluro-Cambrian,\r\nwhere considerable limestones are largely composed of their remains,\r\nmixed, however, and sometimes overpowered with those of Bryozoa and\r\nHydroids. An ordinary coral, such as those of which coral reefs are\r\nbuiltaEuro\"the red coral, used for ornament is not quite similaraEuro\"is the\r\nskeleton of an animal constructed on the plan of a sea anemone; with a\r\ncentral stomach surrounded by radiating chambers, and having above a\r\ncrown of tentacles. The stony coral surrounds and protects the soft body\r\nof the animal, and may either be a single cell, for one animal, or an\r\naggregation of such cells, constituting a rounded or branching mass.\r\nThe modern star coral, represented in Fig. 42, is an instance of the\r\nlatter condition. It shows nineteen or twenty animals, each with a\r\ncentral mouth and fringe of short tentacles, aggregated together, and\r\ntwo of them showing the spontaneous division by which the number of\r\nanimals in the mass is progressively increased. The living coral shows\r\nonly the soft animals and the animal matter connecting them; but if dead\r\nthere would be a white stony mass with a star-like cell or depression\r\ncorresponding to each animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.aEuro\"Living Anthozoan Coral (_AstrA|a_).]\r\n\r\nIn their general plan, the oldest Corals were precisely of this\r\ncharacter, but they presented some differences in detail, which have\r\ncaused them to be divided into two groups, which are eminently\r\ncharacteristic of the PalA|ozoic ageaEuro\"the tabulate or floored corals, and\r\nthe rugose or wrinkled corals. In the former (Fig. 43) the cells are\r\nusually small and thin-walled, often hexagonal, like a honeycomb, and\r\nare floored across at intervals with tabulA| or horizontal plates. A few\r\nmodern corals present a similar arrangement,[14] but this kind of\r\nstructure was far more prevalent in the PalA|ozoic. In the second type\r\nthe animals are usually larger and often solitary, the cell has strongly\r\nmarked radiating plates, while the horizontal floors are absent or\r\nsubordinate, and there is usually a thick external rind or outer coat\r\n(Figs. 44, 45). In general plan, these rugose corals closely resemble\r\nthose of our modern reefs; but they differ in their details of\r\nstructure, and only a very few modern forms from the deep sea are\r\nregarded as actual modern representatives.[15] One curious point of\r\ndifference is that their radiating laminA| begin with four, and increase\r\nby multiples of that number, while in modern corals the numbers are six\r\nand multiples of six; a change of mathematical relation not easily\r\naccounted for, and which assimilates them to Hydroids on the one hand,\r\nand to a higher group, the Alcyonids, on the other, both of which prefer\r\nfour and eight to six, or have had these numbers chosen for them. In the\r\nMesozoic period the tabulate and rugose corals were replaced by others,\r\nthe porous and solid corals of the modern seas; but, in so far as we\r\nknow, the animals producing these, though differing in some details,\r\nwere neither more nor less elevated than their predecessors, and they\r\ntook up precisely the same rA'le as reef-builders in the sea, though with\r\nprobably more tendency to the accumulation of great masses of coral\r\nlimestone in particular spots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.aEuro\"Tabulate Corals.\r\n\r\n_a_, _Halisites_, and _b_, _Favosites_.

These\r\nmerely put in an appearance in the Early Cambrian, but become vastly\r\nmultiplied in the Silurian, where the stalked feather stars (Crinoids)\r\n(Fig. 46) seem to have covered great areas of sea-bottom, and multiplied\r\nso rapidly that thick sheets of limestone are largely made up of the\r\nfragments of their skeletons. The ordinary star-fishes appear first in\r\nthe Silurian (Fig. 47). The sea-urchins begin in the Upper Silurian, the\r\nearly species having numerous and loosely attached plates, like some of\r\nthose now found in the deep sea[16] (Fig. 48).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.aEuro\"Modern Crinoid (_Rhisocrinus Lofotensis_).aEuro\"After\r\nSars.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.aEuro\"_PalA|aster Niagarensis_ (Hall). One of the\r\noldest star fishes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.aEuro\"_PalA|chinus ellipticus_ (McCoy). One of the\r\noldest types of sea-urchins.]\r\n\r\nThe most curious history in this group is that of the feather-stars. In\r\nthe Early Cambrian they are represented by a few species known to us\r\nonly in fragments, and these belong to a humble group (Cystideans)\r\nresembling the larval or immature condition of the higher Crinoids. Fig.\r\n49 shows one of these animals of somewhat later age. They have few or\r\nrudimentary arms and short stalks, and want the beautiful radial\r\nsymmetry of the typical star-fishes. In the Silurian these creatures are\r\nreinforced by a vast number of beautiful and perfect feather-stars\r\n(Figs. 50, 51). These continue to increase in number and beauty, and\r\napparently culminate in the Mesozoic, where gigantic forms exist, some\r\nof them probably having more complicated skeletons, in so far as number\r\nof distinct parts is concerned, than any other animals. Buckland has\r\ncalculated that in a crinoid similar to that in Fig. 52 there are no\r\nless than 150,000 little bones, and 300,000 contractile bundles of\r\nfibres to move them. In the modern seas the feather-stars have somewhat\r\ndwindled both in numbers and complexity, and are mostly confined to the\r\ndepths of the ocean. On the other hand, the various types of ordinary\r\nstar-fishes and sea-urchins have increased in number and importance. We\r\nthus find in this group a certain advance and improvement from the\r\nCystideans of the Early PalA|ozoic to the sea-urchins and their allies.\r\nThis advance is not, however, along one line for the Cystideans\r\ncontinue unimproved to the end. The Crinoids culminate in the Mesozoic,\r\nand are not known to give origin to anything higher. The star-fishes and\r\nsea-urchins commence independently, before the culmination of the\r\nCrinoids, and, though greatly increased in number and variety, still\r\nadhere very closely to their original types.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.aEuro\"_Pleurocystites squamosus_.

Siluro-Cambrian.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.aEuro\"Body of _Glyptocrinus_. Siluro-Cambrian.]\r\n\r\nThe great sub-kingdom of the Mollusca, including the bivalve and\r\nunivalve shell-fishes, makes its first appearance in the Cambrian, where\r\nits earliest representatives belong to a group, the Arm-bearers or Lamp\r\nshells (Brachiopods), held by some to be allied to worms as much as to\r\nmollusks. The oldest of all these shells are allies of the modern\r\n_LingulA|_ (Fig. 54), some of the earliest of which are shown in Fig.\r\n55. The modern _Lingula_ is protected by a delicate two-valved shell,\r\ncomposed, unlike that of most other mollusks, of phosphate of lime or\r\nbone earth. It lives on sand-banks, attached by its long flexible stalk,\r\nwhich it buries like a root in the bottom. Its food consists of\r\nmicroscopic organisms, drifted to its mouth by cilia placed on two\r\narm-like processes, from which the group derives its name. In the modern\r\nworld about one hundred species of Brachiopods are known, belonging to\r\nabout twenty genera, some of which differ considerably from the LingulA|.\r\nThe genus _Terebratula_, represented at Fig. 56, is one of the most\r\ncommon modern as well as fossil forms, and has the valves unequal, with\r\na round opening in one of them for the stalk, which is attached to some\r\nhard object, and there is an internal shelly loop for supporting the\r\narms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.aEuro\"_Extracrinus Briareus_.

Potsdam.]\r\n\r\nThese curious, and in the modern seas, exceptional shells, were dominant\r\nin the PalA|ozoic period. Upwards of three thousand fossil species are\r\nknown, of which a large proportion belong to the Cambrian and Silurian,\r\nnine genera appearing in the Cambrian, and no less than fifty-two in the\r\nSilurian. The history of these creatures is very remarkable. The\r\nLingulA|, which are the first to appear, continue unchanged and with the\r\nsame phosphatic shells to the present day. Morse, who has carefully\r\nstudied an American species, remarks in illustration of this, that it is\r\nexceedingly tenacious of life, bearing much change of depth,\r\ntemperature, etc., without being destroyed. The genus _Discina_, which\r\nis nearly as old, also continues throughout geological time. The genus\r\n_Orthis_ (Fig. 57), which appears at the same time with the last,\r\nbecomes vastly abundant in Silurian times, but dies out altogether\r\nbefore the end of the PalA|ozoic. _Rhynchonella_ (Fig. 58), which comes\r\nin a little later, near the beginning of the Siluro-Cambrian, continues\r\nto this day. _Spirifer_ and _Productus_ (Figs. 59 and 60) appear later, and\r\ndie out at the close of the PalA|ozoic. So strange and inscrutable are\r\nthe fortunes of these animals, which on the whole have lost in the\r\nbattle of life, that their place in nature is vastly less important than\r\nit was. It has been suggested that if any group of creatures could throw\r\nlight upon the theory of descent with modification, it would be these;\r\nbut Davidson, who has perhaps studied them more thoroughly than any\r\nother naturalist, found them as silent on the subject as the sponges or\r\nthe corals. In a series of papers published in the _Geological\r\nMagazine_, a short time before his death, he remarked as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.aEuro\"_Terebratula sacculus_ (Martin).\r\nCarboniferous.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.aEuro\"Brachiopods; genus _Orthis_.\r\n\r\n_a_, _O.

Devonian.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59_a_.aEuro\"_Athyris subtilita_ (Hall). Carboniferous.\r\n\r\n_a_, _b_, Exteriors. _c_, Interior, showing spirals.]\r\n\r\naEurooeWe find that the large number of genera made their first appearance\r\nduring the PalA|ozoic periods, and since they have been decreasing in\r\nnumber to the present period. We will leave out of question the species,\r\nfor they vary so little that it is often very difficult to trace really\r\ngood distinctive characters between them; it is different with the\r\ngenera, as they are, or should be, founded on much greater and more\r\npermanent distinctions. Thus, for example, the family _SpiriferidA|_\r\nincludes genera which are all characterised by a calcified spiral lamina\r\nfor the support of the brachial appendages; and, however varied these\r\nmay be, they always retain the distinctive characters of the group from\r\ntheir first appearance to their extinction. The Brachiopodist labours\r\nunder the difficulties of not being able to determine what are the\r\nsimplest, or which are the highest families into which either of the two\r\ngreat groups of his favourite class is divided; so far, then, he is\r\nunable to point out any evidence favouring progressive development in\r\nit. But, confining himself to species, he sees often before him great\r\nvarietal changes, so much so as to make it difficult for him to define\r\nthe species; and it leads him to the belief that such groups were not of\r\nindependent origin, as was universally thought before Darwin published\r\nhis great work on the _Origin of Species_. But in this respect the\r\nBrachiopoda reveal nothing more than other groups of the organic\r\nkingdoms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.aEuro\"_Productus cora_ (DaEuro(TM)Orbigny). Carboniferous.]\r\n\r\naEurooeNow, although certain genera, such as _Terebratula_, _Rhynchonella_,\r\n_Crania_, and _Discina_, have enjoyed a very considerable geological\r\nexistence, there are genera, such as _Stringocephalus_, _Uncites_,\r\n_Porambonites_, _Koninckina_, and several others, which made their\r\nappearance very suddenly and without any warning; after a while they\r\ndisappeared in a similar abrupt manner, having enjoyed a comparatively\r\nshort existence. They are all possessed of such marked and distinctive\r\ninternal characters that we cannot trace between them and associated or\r\nsynchronous genera any evidence of their being either modifications of\r\none or the other, or of being the result of descent with modification.\r\nTherefore, although far from denying the possibility or probability of\r\nthe correctness of the Darwinian theory, I could not conscientiously\r\naffirm that the Brachiopoda, as far as I am at present acquainted with\r\nthem, would be of much service in proving it. The subject is worthy of\r\nthe continued and serious attention of every well-informed man of\r\nscience. The sublime Creator of the universe has bestowed on him a\r\nthinking mind; therefore all that can be discovered is legitimate.\r\nScience has this advantage, that it is continually on the advance, and\r\nis ever ready to correct its errors when fresh light or new discoveries\r\nmake such necessary.aEuroŁ The late Joachim Barrande, the great\r\npalA|ontologist of Bohemia, bears similar testimony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.aEuro\"Group of Older PalA|ozoic Lamellibranchs.aEuro\"After\r\nBillings.\r\n\r\n1, _Cucullea opima_. 2, _Nucula oblonga_. 3, _Nucula lineata_. 4,\r\n_Cypricardia truncata_. 5, _Tellina ovata_. 6, _Nucula bellatula_. 7,\r\n_Modiola concentrica_.]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary bivalves, like the mussels and cockles, now so very\r\nplentiful on our coasts, are rare in the Cambrian and Silurian, and for\r\nthe first time make a somewhat conspicuous appearance in the Upper\r\nSilurian and Devonian. But from the first they resemble very closely\r\ntheir modern successors, though on the whole neither so large nor so\r\nornate (Fig. 61). Their fortunes have thus been precisely the opposite\r\nof those of the Brachiopods, though in neither case is there very\r\nmarked elevation or deterioration in the individual animals. A very\r\nsimilar statement may be made as to the sea-snails, whether the curious\r\nwinged snails (Pteropods) or the ordinary crawlers (Gastropods). The\r\nformer come in early, and are represented by PalA|ozoic forms finer than\r\nany now extant. The genus _Conularia_ (Fig. 62) presents some Silurian\r\nspecies six inches or more in length, which are giants in comparison\r\nwith any now living. The forms of more ordinary Gastropods from the\r\nSilurian represented in Fig. 63 will suffice to show that their styles\r\nare not very dissimilar from those still extant.[17] As in the case of\r\nthe ordinary bivalves, however, the modern Gastropods much exceed in\r\nnumbers and magnitude those of the PalA|ozoic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.aEuro\"_Conularia planicostata_ (Dn.).

The great numbers in which the smaller\r\nspecies appear on many coasts, and the immense size and formidable\r\ncharacter of others; their singular apparatus of arms, bearing suckers,\r\ntheir strange forms, and the inky secretion with which they can darken\r\nthe water, have at all times attracted popular attention. The great\r\ncomplexity of their structures, and the fact that in many points they\r\nstand quite at the head of the invertebrates of the sea, and approach\r\nmost nearly to the elevation of the true fishes, have secured to them\r\nthe attention of naturalists. Some of these animals have shelly internal\r\nsupports, and one genus, that of the Argonauts, or Paper Nautili, has an\r\nexternal protective shell. Allied, though more distantly, to the\r\nCuttle-fishes, are the true Nautili, represented in the modern sea\r\nprincipally by the Pearly Nautilus, though there are two other species,\r\nboth of them very rare. The modern pearly nautilus (Fig. 65) may be\r\nregarded as a peculiar kind of cuttle-fish provided with a discoidal\r\nshell for protection, and also for floatage. The shell is divided into a\r\nnumber of chambers by partitions. Of these the animal inhabits the last\r\nand largest. The others are empty, and are connected with the body of\r\nthe animal only by a pipe, or siphuncle, with membranous walls and\r\nfilled with fluid. Thus provided, the nautilus, when in the water, has\r\npractically no weight, and can move up or down in the sea with the\r\ngreatest facility, using its sucker-bearing arms and horny beak to seize\r\nand devour the animals on which it preys. The buoyancy of the shell\r\nseems exactly adapted to the weight of the animal; and this proportion\r\nis kept up by the addition of new air-chambers as the body increases in\r\nsize. In the modern seas this singular little group stands entirely\r\nisolated, and its individuals are so rare that it is difficult to\r\nprocure perfect specimens for collections, though its mechanical\r\nstructure and advantages for the struggle for existence seem of the\r\nhighest order. But in the old world of past geological time the case was\r\naltogether different.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.aEuro\"Squid (_Loligo_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.aEuro\"Pearly Nautilus (_Nautilus pompilius_).\r\n\r\n_a_, Mantle. _b_, Its dorsal fold. _c_, Hood. _o_, Eye. _t_, Tentacles.\r\n_f_, Funnel. _g_, Air chambers. _h_, Siphuncle.]\r\n\r\nThe Nautiloid shell-fishes burst suddenly upon us in the beginning of\r\nthe Siluro-Cambrian, or Lower Silurian, BarrandeaEuro(TM)s second fauna; and\r\nthis applies to all the countries where they have been studied. In this\r\nformation alone about 450 species are known, and in the Silurian these\r\nincrease to 1,200; and here the group culminates. It returns in the\r\nDevonian to about the same number with the Lower Silurian, diminishes in\r\nthe Carboniferous to 350, and in the Mesozoic, where the Nautiloid forms\r\nare replaced by others of the type of the Ammonites, becomes largely\r\nreduced. In the Tertiary there are but nineteen species, and, as already\r\nstated, in the modern world _three_. These statements do not, however,\r\nrepresent the whole truth. In the PalA|ozoic, in addition to the genus\r\n_Nautilus_, we have a great number of other genera, some with perfectly\r\nstraight shells, like _Orthoceras_ (Fig. 66), others bent\r\n(_Cyrtoceras_), others differing in the style of siphuncle, or aperture,\r\nor chambers (_Endoceras_, _Gomphoceras_, _Lituites_, Figs. 67 to 69), or\r\ninflated into sac-like forms (_Ascoceras_). There is, besides, the\r\nfamily of the _GoniatidA|_ (Fig. 70), with the chambers thrown into\r\nangular folds and the siphuncle at the back. Further, some of the early\r\nforms, as the OrthoceratidA|, attain to gigantic dimensions, being six\r\nfeet or more in length, and nearly a foot in diameter. Thus the idea\r\nthat we should naturally form from the study of the Nautilus, that it\r\nrepresents a type suited for much more varied and important adaptations\r\nthan those that we now see, is more than realised in those PalA|ozoic\r\nages when these animals seem to have been the lords of the seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.aEuro\"_Orthoceras_.

Triassic.]\r\n\r\nWhen we leave the PalA|ozoic and enter the Mesozoic, though the Nautiloid\r\nshells still abound, we find them superseded, in great part, by a nobler\r\nform, that of the _AmmonitidA|_ (Figs. 71, 72). These are remarkable for\r\nthe ornate markings on the surfaces of their shells, and for the\r\nbeautifully waved edges of the partitions (Fig. 72_a_), which, by giving\r\na much more complete support to the sides of the shell, must have\r\ncontributed greatly to the union of lightness and strength so important\r\nto the utility of the shell as a float. This type admits of all the same\r\nvariety of straight, bent, and curled forms with the simpler Nautiloid\r\ntype, and some of the species are of great size, Ammonites being known\r\nthree feet or more in diameter. These animals, unknown in the PalA|ozoic,\r\nappear in numerous species in the Early Mesozoic, culminate in hundreds\r\nof beautiful species in the middle of that era, and disappear for ever\r\nat its close, leaving no modern successors. Many and beautiful species\r\nof Ammonites and their allies have been obtained from the Mesozoic rocks\r\nof British Columbia and other parts of the west coast of North America,\r\nperfectly representing this group as it occurs at the same period in\r\nEurope, and closely resembling the Mesozoic Ammonites of India. These\r\nanimals have all perished, yet the Atlantic and the Pacific roll\r\nbetween, apparently with conditions as favourable for their comfortable\r\nexistence as those of any previous time. They perished long ago, at the\r\ndawn of the Tertiary; yet the genus Nautilus, one of the oldest and\r\nleast improved of the whole, survived, and still testifies to the\r\nwonderful contrivance embodied in these animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.aEuro\"_Ammonites Jason_ (Reinecke).

He sums up all the known facts in the\r\nmost elaborate manner, considering first the embryonic characters of the\r\nshell in the different genera, then their distribution in space and\r\ntime, then all the different parts and characters of the shells in the\r\ndifferent groupsaEuro\"the whole with reference to any possible derivation of\r\nthe species; and he finds that all leads to the result that in every\r\nrespect these shells seem to have been so introduced as to make any\r\ntheory of evolution with respect to them altogether untenable. In his\r\nconcluding sentence this greatest of PalA|ozoic palA|ontologists affirms\r\nthat, aEurooeThe theoretical evolution of the Cephalopods is, like that of the\r\nTrilobites, a mere figment of imagination, without any foundation in\r\nfact.aEuroŁ[18]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.aEuro\"_Belemnite._aEuro\"After Philips.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74_a_.aEuro\"_Belemnoteuthis antiquus._ Supposed to be a\r\nBelemnite, with soft parts preserved.aEuro\"Jurassic.aEuro\"After Mantell.]\r\n\r\nI have reserved no space to notice the geological history of the other\r\nand higher group of Cephalopods, including the true Cuttles and Squids.\r\nThis is perhaps less to be regretted, as, from the absence of external\r\nshells, they are likely to be much less perfectly known as fossils. So\r\nfar as known, they are vastly younger than the Nautiloids, for no\r\nexamples whatever have been found in the PalA|ozoic. They appear\r\nabundantly in the Mesozoic, but are there represented principally by an\r\nextinct group of squids (Belemnites and their allies, Figs. 74, 74_a_),\r\nremarkable for the great and complicated development of their internal\r\nsupport, which has a chambered float as well as a solid sheath. This\r\nfamily becomes extinct at the close of the Mesozoic, though the cuttles\r\nas a whole perhaps culminate in the modern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.aEuro\"Cambrian Trilobites.\r\n\r\n_a_, _Paradoxides_. _b_, _Dikellocephalus_. _c_, _Conocoryphe_ (head).\r\n_d_, _Agnostus_ (head and tail).]\r\n\r\nThe remarkable group of the Trilobites had precedence in order of time\r\nof the Nautiloid shell-fishes. No animal structures can well be more\r\ndissimilar than those of the two great groups of aquatic animals which\r\npopular speech confounds under the name of aEurooeshell-fishes.aEuroŁ Take a whelk\r\nand a crab, for example, and compare their general forms, the structure\r\nof their shells, and their organs of motion, and it is scarcely possible\r\nto imagine any two animals more unlike; and when we examine their\r\nanatomy in detail this difference does not diminish. They have, it is\r\ntrue, corresponding parts, and these parts serve similar uses, but in\r\nplan of structure they are wholly different. Yet both animals may live\r\nin the same pool, and may subsist on nearly the same food. If we attempt\r\nto find some common type which both resemble, we may trace the structure\r\nof the crab back to those of some of the marine worms with which it has\r\nsome affinity, and those of the whelk to such creatures as the\r\n_Lingula_, which are supposed to have a resemblance to the worms. But\r\nstill the two types, that of the Mollusk and the Articulate, are\r\ndistinct even from their first appearance in the egg, nor have either\r\nany close affinities with the Protozoa, the Hydroids, or the Corals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.aEuro\"Transverse section of _Calymene_.

What older phases they may have\r\npassed through we know not; but in the Lower Cambrian we have various\r\nforms of these animals, including some of the largest known as well as\r\nsome of the smallest; some of the most complex in number of parts as\r\nwell as some of the simplest. These animals, in short, seem to have\r\nappeared at once all over the world fully formed, and in a variety of\r\ngeneric and specific forms; and nothing short of a very large faith in\r\nthe imperfection of the geological record can suffice to account for\r\ntheir evolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76_a_.aEuro\"Burrows of Trilobite and of modern\r\nKing-crab. The Trilobite burrow is known as Ruschinites, and has been\r\nsupposed to be a sea-weed of the kind called _Bilobites_.]\r\n\r\nA Trilobite is a creature in whose structure the number three is\r\ndominant. Seen from above, it presents three divisions from front to\r\nrear:aEuro\"first, a cephalic shield or head-piece; secondly, a thorax,\r\ndivided into several segments movable upon each other; and thirdly, a\r\ntail-piece or pygidium, which, when brought against the head by the\r\nrolling up of the body segments, effectually covers the lower parts.\r\nThis lower portion was until lately little known; but the discoveries of\r\nBillings and of Wolcott have enabled us to restore the jaws under the\r\nhead, the jointed legs and spiral gills under the thorax, and thus to\r\ncomplete the structure of the animal, and understand better its\r\nrelations to modern crabs and shrimps (Fig. 76). Of these it certainly\r\ncomes nearest to the King-crabs and Horseshoe-crabs, a somewhat limited\r\ngroup at present, and one which reaches back in geological time only to\r\nthe Upper Silurian, when the Trilobites had perhaps already passed their\r\nculmination.\r\n\r\nConstructed as above described, the Trilobite could swim, as is\r\nsupposed, usually on its back or side. It could crawl on the bottom.\r\nUsing its snout as a shovel, it could burrow like a modern King-crab\r\n(Fig. 76_a_); and when pressed by danger some species could roll\r\nthemselves into balls and defy their enemies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.aEuro\"Silurian Trilobites.\r\n\r\n_a_, _Isotelus_. _b_, _Homalonotus_. _c_, _Calymene_.]\r\n\r\nThis type of animal, entering on the stage in full force in the Older\r\nCambrian, continues under many forms through the whole PalA|ozoic age,\r\ndying out finally in the Carboniferous. Figs. 77 and 78 show a few of\r\nthe forms of the Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous.\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with the dawn of the Trilobite group, appear some\r\nsmall shrimp-like forms (Fig. 28),[19] and others with bivalve shells\r\n(Fig. 79), which are closely allied to modern forms,[20] and, like the\r\n_LingulA|_, persist through the succeeding formations with little more\r\nthan specific changeaEuro\"presenting in this a strange contrast to the\r\nTrilobites. While the latter were still flourishing, about the close of\r\nthe Lower Silurian, a remarkable group of large and highly-developed\r\ncreatures, allied to the Trilobites, but suited for rapid swimming\r\nrather than creeping, was introduced; and in the Upper Silurian and\r\nDevonian these creatures[21] attained to gigantic sizes, exceeding,\r\nprobably, any modern Crustaceans, and were tyrants of the seas.\r\n_Pterygotus anglicus_ (Fig. 80) is supposed to have attained the length\r\nof six feet. Yet these noble representatives of the Crustaceans became\r\nextinct in the Carboniferous. On the other hand, a few small king-crabs\r\nappear in the Upper Silurian, and this type still continues, and seems\r\nto culminate as to size in modern times; so diverse have been the\r\nfortunes of these various groups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.aEuro\"Devonian and Carboniferous Trilobites.\r\n\r\n_a_, _Phaceps latifrons_ (Bronn). _b_, _Philipsia Howi_ (Billings)\r\n(tail).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.aEuro\"PalA|ozoic Ostracod Crustaceans.

Silurian.]\r\n\r\nThe higher, or decapod Crustaceans, now familiar to us in the modern\r\ncrabs and lobsters, are first found in a few small species in the\r\nDevonian[22] and Carboniferous, and they are accompanied in the Devonian\r\nby at least one species of the allied group of the Stomapods (Figs. 81,\r\n82).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.aEuro\"_Pterygotus anglicus_.

The carapace only.]\r\n\r\nThe PalA|ozoic age of geology is thus emphatically an age of\r\ninvertebrates of the sea. In this period they were dominant in the\r\nwaters, and until toward its close almost without rivals. We shall find,\r\nhowever, that in the Upper Silurian, fishes made their appearance, and\r\nin the Carboniferous amphibian reptiles, and that, before the close of\r\nthe PalA|ozoic, vertebrate life in these forms had become predominant.\r\nWe shall also see that just as the leading groups of Mollusks and\r\nCrustaceans seem to have had no ancestors, so it is with the groups of\r\nVertebrates which take their places. It is also interesting to observe\r\nthat already in the PalA|ozoic all the types of invertebrate marine life\r\nwere as fully represented as at present, and that this swarming marine\r\nlife breaks upon us in successive waves as we proceed upward from the\r\nCambrian. Thus the progress of life is not gradual, but intermittent,\r\nand consists in the sudden and rapid influx of new forms destined to\r\nincrease and multiply in the place of those which are becoming effete\r\nand ready to vanish away or to sink to a lower place. Farther, since the\r\ngreat waves of aquatic life roll in with each great subsidence of the\r\nland, a fact which coincides with their appearance in the limestones of\r\nthe successive periods, it follows that it is not struggle for\r\nexistence, but expansion under favourable circumstances and the opening\r\nup of new fields of migration that is favourable to the introduction of\r\nnew species. The testimony of palA|ontology on this point, which I have\r\nelsewhere adduced at length,[23] in my judgment altogether subverts the\r\nprevalent theory of aEurooesurvival of the fittest,aEuroŁ and shows that the\r\nstruggle for existence, so far from being a cause of development and\r\nimprovement, has led only to decay and extinction, whereas the advent of\r\nnew and favourable conditions, and the removal of severe competition,\r\nare the circumstances favourable to introduction of new and advanced\r\nspecies. This testimony of the invertebrates of the sea we shall find is\r\nconfirmed by other groups of living beings, to be noticed in the\r\nsequel.[24]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.aEuro\"The term aEurooeSiluro-Cambrian,aEuroŁ as used in this and the next chapter,\r\nis synonymous with aEurooeOrdovicianaEuroŁ of Lapworth, which is now coming into\r\nsomewhat general use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORDAITES, OF THE GROUP OF DORY-CORDAITES. BRANCH\r\nRESTORED.aEuro\"After GrandaEuro(TM) Eury.]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF PLANT LIFE ON THE LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the graphite of the Laurentian rocks was derived from vegetable\r\nmatter, the further question arises, Was this vegetation of the land, or\r\nof the sea? and something may be said on both sides of this question. If\r\nthere were land plants in the Laurentian period, they must have grown\r\neither on rocks older than the Laurentian itself, or on such portions of\r\nthe beds of the latter as had been raised out of the sea, forming\r\nperhaps swampy flats of newly-made soil. But we know no rocks older than\r\nthe Laurentian, and there is no positive evidence that any of the beds\r\nof that formation were other than marine. Still it is not impossible\r\nthat some of the beds which are now graphitic gneisses may originally\r\nhave been similar to the bituminous shales, coals, or under-clays of the\r\ncoal formation. The graphite occurring in veins, if of vegetable origin,\r\nmust have been derived from liquid bitumen oozing into fissures; and\r\nveins of this kind occur in later formations, both in marine and\r\nfresh-water beds. The only other positive argument which has been\r\nadduced in favour of the existence of abundant land plants in the\r\nLaurentian is that of Dr. Sterry Hunt, derived from the great beds of\r\niron ore, which it is difficult to account for chemically except on the\r\nhypothesis of the decay in the air of great quantities of vegetable\r\nmatter. The question must remain in doubt till some one is fortunate\r\nenough to find portions of the Laurentian carbon retaining traces of\r\norganic structure. My own observations, though somewhat numerous, allow\r\nme only to say that the graphite sometimes presents fibrous forms, that\r\nit occasionally appears as vermicular threadsaEuro\"which, however, I suppose\r\nto be fillings of canals of _Eozoon_aEuro\"and that in the graphitic beds there\r\nare occasionally slender root-like bodies of a lighter colour than the\r\nmass; but none of these indications are sufficient to determine anything\r\nas to its vegetable origin, or the nature of the plants from which it\r\nmay have been derived.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the quantity of carbon which has been accumulated in the\r\nLaurentian rocks is very great. I have measured one bed at Buckingham,\r\non the Ottawa, estimated to contain 20 per cent. of carbon, and which is\r\nat least eight feet in thickness. Sir William Logan has described\r\nanother similar bed from ten to twelve feet thick, and more recent\r\nreports of the Geological Survey of Canada mention a bed supposed to be\r\ntwenty-five feet thick, in which Mr. Hoffman finds 30 per cent. of\r\ncarbon. On the whole the quantity of carbon in the graphitic zone of the\r\nLaurentian is comparable with that in certain productive coal-fields,\r\nand we certainly have in the subsequent geological history no examples\r\nof such accumulations except from remains of the luxuriant vegetation of\r\nswampy flats.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Laurentian and Huronian have as yet afforded no evidence of\r\nland vegetation. The Cambrian, as already stated, abounds in remains of\r\nsea-weeds; but though the forms which have been named _Eophyton_ have\r\nbeen regarded as land plants, this claim is, to say the least, very\r\ndoubtful; and I have as yet seen nothing of this kind which did not\r\nappear to me to be merely markings made by objects drifted over the\r\nbottom or remains of marine plants. Yet in the Upper Cambrian there are\r\nwide surfaces of littoral sandstone often containing minute carbonised\r\nfragments, and which might be expected to afford indications of land\r\nvegetation, had such existed. I have myself devoted many days of\r\nfruitless labour to the examination of the large areas of Potsdam\r\nsandstone exposed in some parts of Canada. But as these rocks were\r\nevidently formed along the borders of a Laurentian continent capable of\r\nsupporting vegetation, we may still hope for some discovery of this\r\nkind, more especially if we could find the point where some fresh-water\r\nstream ran into the Cambrian sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.aEuro\"_Protannularia Harknessii_ (Nicholson). A\r\nSiluro-Cambrian Plant, from the Skiddaw series.]\r\n\r\nThe oldest plants, probably higher than AlgA|, known to me by their\r\nexternal forms, are those described by Nicholson[25] from the\r\nSiluro-Cambrian Skiddaw slates of the north of England (Fig. 83). Their\r\ndiscoverer has named them _Buthotrephis Harknessii_ and _B.\r\nradiata_,[26] stating, however, that these two species are not\r\nimprobably portions of the same plant, and that its form is rather that\r\nof a land plant than of an Alga. The specimens of these plants which I\r\nhave seen appear to me to support the conclusion that they represent one\r\nspecies, and this allied to the _AnnulariA|_ of the Devonian and\r\nCarboniferous periods, which probably grew in shallow water with only\r\ntheir upper parts in the air, and bore whorls or verticles of narrow\r\nleaves. They were either relatives of the MareaEuro(TM)s-tails, or of the\r\nRhosocarps, of our modern swamps and ponds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.aEuro\"American Lower Silurian Plants.aEuro\"After\r\nLesquereux.\r\n\r\n_a_, _Sphenophyllum primA|vum_. _b_, _Protostigma sigillarioides_.]\r\n\r\nSomewhat higher up in the Lower Silurian, in the Cincinnati group of\r\nAmerica, Lesquereux finds objects which he refers to the genus\r\n_Sphenophyllum_, which is closely allied to _Annularia_ (Fig. 84, _a_),\r\nand also a plant which he terms _Protostigma_ (Fig. 84, _b_), and\r\nbelieves to be the stem of a tree allied to the club-mosses.[27] He also\r\nfinds minute branching stems, which he refers to the genus\r\n_Psilophyton_, to be mentioned in the sequel; but as to these I have\r\nsome doubts whether they may not be Zoophytes allied to the Graptolites,\r\nrather than plants of that genus. These discoveries tend to show the\r\nprobable existence in the Siluro-Cambrian of plants representing two of\r\nthe three leading families of the higher cryptogams or flowerless\r\nplants, namely, the Club-mosses and the MareaEuro(TM)s-tails. Thus land\r\nvegetation begins with the highest members of the lower of the two great\r\nseries into which botanists divide the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.aEuro\"Fragment of outer surface of _Glyptodendron_ of\r\nClaypole. A Silurian Tree.]\r\n\r\nIf we now turn to the Silurian, further evidence of land vegetation\r\npresents itself. Near the base of this great series, the club-moss\r\nfamily is represented by a plant discovered by Claypole in the Clinton\r\ngroup, and referred to a new genus (_Glyptodendron_, Fig. 86). Plants of\r\nthis family have also been noticed by Barrande in Bohemia, and by page\r\nin Scotland; and a humble but interesting member of the family,\r\nconnecting it with the pillworts, _Psilophyton_ (Fig. 87), though more\r\ncharacteristic of the Devonian, has been found in the Upper Silurian\r\nboth in Canada and the United States. No Ferns or Equiseta have as yet\r\nbeen found in the Silurian; but in 1870 I recognised in some fragments\r\nof wood from the Ludlow bone-bed, in the Museum of the Geological Survey\r\nof Great Britain, the structure of that curious prototypal tree, to\r\nwhich I have given the name _Nematophyton_, and which was first\r\nrecognised in the Devonian of GaspA(C). Since that time I have found in the\r\nUpper Silurian beds of Cape Bon Ami, in New Brunswick, similar fragments\r\nof fossil wood, associated with round seed-like bodies, having a central\r\nnucleus and a thick wall or test of radiating fibres. These bodies show\r\na structure similar to that of those found in the Upper Ludlow of\r\nEngland, and described by Hooker under the name _Pachytheca_. In my\r\njudgment they are certainly true seeds.[28] Seeds of this kind have also\r\nbeen found by Hicks in the still older Denbighshire grits of North\r\nWales, along with fragments of the wood of _Nematophyton_, and with\r\nremains of branching stems which have been described under the name\r\n_Berwynia_, though it is not unlikely that they represent the branches\r\nof _Nematophyton_. It is proper to add that these ancient vegetable\r\nfossils are regarded by some English botanists as gigantic algA| or\r\nsea-weeds, but I confess I am unable to adopt this view of their nature.\r\nThe supposed fern of the Upper Silurian, figured in the first edition of\r\nthis work, has proved on further examination to be merely an imitative\r\nform produced by crystallisation. On the other hand, the recent\r\ndiscovery of a cockroach and two species of Scorpion in the Silurian,\r\nproves the existence of land animals as well as plants at this period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.aEuro\"_Psilophyton princeps_ (Dn.)

In the restoration one side is\r\nrepresented in vernation, and the other in fruit.]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that these discoveries represent merely a small\r\nproportion of the plants actually existing in the Silurian period. All\r\nthe deposits of this age at present known to us are marine; and most of\r\nthem were probably formed at a distance from land, so that it is little\r\nlikely that land plants could find their way into them. At any time the\r\ndiscovery of an estuarine or lacustrine deposit of Silurian age might\r\nwonderfully extend our knowledge of this ancient flora.\r\n\r\nThe Devonian or Erian age, that of the classic Old Red Sandstone of\r\nScotland, is that in which we find the first great and complete land\r\nflora; and though this is inferior in number of species to that of the\r\nsucceeding Carboniferous, and greatly less important with reference to\r\nits practical bearing on our welfare, it is in some respects superior in\r\nthat variety which depends on diversity of soil and of station. To\r\nappreciate this, it will be necessary to glance at the range and\r\nsubdivisions of the modern flora.\r\n\r\nIn the modern world we divide all vegetation into two great series, that\r\nof the Flowering Plants (_PhA|nogams_), which also produce true fruits\r\nand seeds, and that of the Flowerless Plants (_Cryptogams_), which\r\nproduce minute spores instead of seeds. The latter is in every respect\r\nthe lower group. This lower series is again divisible into three\r\nclassesaEuro\"first and lowest, that of the Seaweeds, Moulds, and Lichens\r\n(Thallophytes). Secondly, that of the Mosses and their allies\r\n(Anophytes). Thirdly, that of the Ferns, Equisetums and Club-mosses\r\n(Acrogens). In like manner the second, or higher series is divisible\r\ninto three classes: that of the Pines and Cycads (Gymnosperms), having\r\nnaked seeds not covered by true fruits, and woody tissue of simple\r\nstructure; that of the Palms and Grasses and their allies (Endogens);\r\nand last and highest, that of the ordinary timber trees and other plants\r\nallied to them, with exogenous stems, netted-veined leaves, and a\r\ntwo-leaved embryo (Exogens). These last are in every respect the\r\ndominant plants on our present continents. Carrying with us this twofold\r\ndivision of the vegetable kingdom and its subdivisions, we shall be\r\nprepared to understand the relation of the more ancient floras to that\r\nnow living.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.aEuro\"Trunk of a Devonian Tree-fern (_Caulopteris\r\nLockwoodi_, Dn.).

Brunswick.]\r\n\r\nIn the Devonian age we meet with no land plants of the two lower\r\nclasses of the Cryptogams, and with scarcely any that can be referred to\r\nthe two higher classes of PhA|nogams, so that the vegetation of this\r\nperiod presents a remarkable character of mediocrity, being composed\r\nalmost entirely of the highest class of the flowerless plants and the\r\nlowest class of those that flower. Of the former there are Tree-ferns\r\nand vast numbers of herbaceous forms (Figs. 88, 89), great\r\nLycopodiaceous plants, immensely better developed than those now\r\nexisting (Fig. 90), and gigantic _Calamites_, allied to the MaresaEuro(TM)-tails\r\n(Fig. 91), along with humbler members of the same group (Fig. 95). Of\r\nthe latter there were Pines of great stature, known to us at present\r\nonly by their wood (Fig. 92); and that other allied trees existed we\r\nhave evidence in numerous seeds which must have belonged to this class\r\n(Fig. 93), and in long flag-like leaves[29] which modern discoveries\r\nwould refer to the same group. As yet we know no Devonian Palms or\r\nGrasses; and only a single specimen has been found indicating the\r\nexistence of a plant of the highest vegetable class, that of the true\r\nexogens. This unique specimen, found by Hall in the Devonian of the\r\nshores of Lake Erie, is a fragment of mineralised wood, the structures\r\nof which are represented in Fig. 94. The large ducts seen in cross\r\nsection in Nos. 1, 2, and 3, and in longitudinal section in Nos. 4 and\r\n5, and the medullary rays, seen in Nos. 1, 4, and 6, testify to the fact\r\nthat this chip of wood must have belonged to a tree of the same type\r\nwhich contains our oaks, maples, and poplars; a type which does not\r\nappear to have become dominant till near the close of the Mesozoic, but\r\nwhich already existed, though perhaps only in few species, and only in\r\nupland and inland positions, as far back as the Middle Devonian. Perhaps\r\none of the most interesting discoveries in the Erian or Devonian rocks\r\nhas been that of the immense abundance of spores of those humble plants\r\nthe Rhizocarps, represented in modern times by the Pillworts and\r\nSalviniA|, &c. To these it is believed that _Sphenophyllum_ and\r\n_Psilophyton_ were allied; but in addition to this there are thick and\r\nvastly extended beds of bituminous shale which owe their inflammable\r\nproperties to countless multitudes of Macrospores (_Sporangites_) of the\r\ngenus _Protosalvinia_.[30] In Ohio there are beds of this kind 350 feet\r\nthick, and extending across the State. They occur also in Canada, where\r\nthese forms were first recognised by the writer in the bituminous shale\r\nof Kettle Point, Lake Huron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.aEuro\"A Devonian Taxine Conifer (_Dadoxylon\r\nouangondianum_, Dn.).

It spread itself to the\r\nsouthward, and was finally destroyed in the great subsidences and\r\ndisturbances which closed the Devonian age, and which were probably\r\naccompanied with refrigeration of climate. It was succeeded by the more\r\nmassive and richer, but more monotonous flora of the Carboniferous, a\r\nperiod in which large areas of our continents were in the state of\r\nswampy and often submerged flats, and in which the climate was again\r\nwarm and uniform.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.aEuro\"_Asterophyllites parvula_ (Dn.), and\r\n_Sphenophyllum antiquum_ (Dn.). Middle Devonian, New Brunswick.]\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous age was, even more emphatically than the Devonian, an\r\nage of Acrogens and Conifers. A few Carboniferous Fungi have recently\r\nbeen discovered, but there are no known Lichens or Mosses. There seem to\r\nbe a few Endogens, but no true Exogens. The great bulk of the plants\r\nconsists of Acrogens and Gymnosperms, as in the previous period. As this\r\nflora is so very important and so much better known than any other of\r\nthose belonging to the infancy of the vegetable kingdom, we may notice a\r\nlittle in detail some of its leading forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.aEuro\"_Calamites._ Carboniferous.\r\n\r\nA, _C.

These are the _Calamites_, which formed dense brakes\r\nand jungles on the margins of the great swampy flats of this period.\r\nTheir tall stems, ribbed and jointed, bore whorls of leaves or\r\nbranchlets. Sending out horizontal root-stocks and budding out from the\r\nbase, they grew in great clumps, and had the capacity to resist the\r\neffects of accumulating sediment by constantly sending out new stems at\r\nhigher and higher levels. The larger species assumed a complexity in the\r\nstructure of their stems unknown in their modern congeners, and enabling\r\nthem to grow to a great height;[31] but their foliage and fructification\r\nwere not correspondingly advanced. Thus the family of the EquisetaceA|\r\nculminated in the Carboniferous, and thenceforth descended gradually in\r\nthe succeeding ages, leaving the comparatively humble MaresaEuro(TM)-tails and\r\nScouring Rushes as its present representatives.\r\n\r\nThe Ferns of the Carboniferous, like those of the Devonian, presented\r\nboth gigantic forms like those of the tree-ferns of the modern tropics,\r\nand delicate herbaceous species, and these in great profusion. On the\r\nwhole, they do not strike the observer as very dissimilar from those of\r\nmodern times. A more critical examination, however, shows that the bulk\r\nof the tree-ferns of the Devonian and Carboniferous are allied not to\r\nthe Polypod type, which is the most common at present, but to certain\r\ncomparatively rare southern ferns, the _Marattias_ and their allies,\r\ncharacterised by a peculiar style of fructification, perhaps adapting\r\nthem to a moist and warm atmosphere (Fig. 97).[32] Thus the ferns, while\r\na wonderfully persistent type, were in their grander forms far more\r\nwidely distributed in the Carboniferous than at present; and genera now\r\ncomparatively rare, and limited to warm and moist climates, were then\r\nabundant, and ranged over those temperate and boreal regions of the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere where only a few humble and hardy species can now\r\nsubsist. There were also some remarkable and anomalous tree-ferns, of\r\nwhich that represented in Fig. 98 is an example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.aEuro\"Carboniferous Tree-ferns.\r\n\r\n  A, _Megaphyton magnificum_ (Dn.).\r\n  C, _PalA|opteris Hartii_ (Dn.).\r\n  D, _P. Acadica_ (Dn.).]\r\n\r\nThe family of the Club-mosses, already, even in the Devonian, in advance\r\nof its modern development, experiences in the Carboniferous a remarkable\r\nand portentous extension into great trees of several genera and many\r\nspecies, constituting apparently extensive forests, and having the woody\r\ntissues of their stems developed to a degree unheard of in their present\r\nrepresentatives (Fig. 99). Further, they become closely linked, in\r\nexternal form at least, with another and more advanced type, that of the\r\n_SigillariA|_. These remarkable trees were the most abundant of all in\r\nthe swamps of the coal-formation, and probably those which most\r\ncontributed to the accumulation of coal. They presented tall pillar-like\r\ntrunks, often ribbed longitudinally, and with perpendicular rows of\r\nscars of fallen leaves. Dividing at top into a few thick branches, they\r\nwere covered with long rigid grass-like foliage. Their fruit was borne\r\nin rings or whorls of spikes surrounding the branches at intervals (Fig.\r\n100). Their roots were strangely symmetrical, spreading out like\r\nunderground branches into the soft soil by a regular process of\r\nbifurcation, and were covered with rootlets diverging in every\r\ndirection, and so jointed to the main root that when broken off they\r\nleft round marks regularly arranged. These roots are the so-called\r\n_StigmariA|_, so abundant in every coal-field, and especially filling the\r\naEurooeunder-claysaEuroŁ of the coal-beds, which are the soils on which the plants\r\nforming these beds were supported. The true botanical position of the\r\n_SigillariA|_ has been a matter of much controversy. Some of them\r\nundoubtedly have structures akin to those of the tree-like Club-mosses,\r\nas Williamson has well shown, and may have been cryptogamous. Others\r\nhave structures of higher character, akin to those of the modern Cycads,\r\nand seem to have borne nutlets allied to those of these plants. Yet the\r\nexternal forms of these diverse sorts are so similar that no definite\r\nseparation of them has yet been made. Either these anomalous trees\r\nconstitute a link connecting the two great series of the vegetable\r\nkingdom, or we have been confounding two distinct groups, owing to\r\nimperfect information.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.aEuro\"_Lepidodendron corrugatum_ (Dn.).

Leaf and Leaf-scars.]\r\n\r\nAnother curious, and till recently little understood, group of\r\nCarboniferous trees is that known as _Cordaites_, which existed already\r\nin some of its species in the Devonian. Their leaves are long, and often\r\nbroad as well, and with numerous delicate parallel veins, resembling in\r\nthis the leaves of grasses. Corda long ago showed that one species at\r\nleast has a stem allied to the Club-mosses. More recently GrandaEuro(TM) Eury\r\nhas found in the South of France admirably preserved specimens, which\r\nshow that others more resembled in their structure the Pines and Yews,\r\nand were probably Gymnosperms, approaching to the Pines, but with very\r\npeculiar and exceptional foliage, of which the only modern examples are\r\nthe broad-leaved Pines of the genus _Dammara_ (Frontispiece to Chapter).\r\nHere again we have either two very distinct groups, combined through our\r\nignorance, or a connecting link between the Lycopods and the Pines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.aEuro\"_Trigonocarpum Hookeri_ (Dn.). A Gymnospermous\r\nseed.\r\n\r\n_a_, Testa. _b_, Tegmen. _c_, Nucleus. _d_, Embryo.]\r\n\r\nThe Yews and their allies among modern trees, while members of the great\r\nCone-bearing order, bear nut-like seeds in fleshy envelopes, sometimes,\r\nas in the GA-nkgo of Japan, constituting edible fruits. Seeds of this\r\ntype seem to have been extremely abundant in the Carboniferous age in\r\nall parts of the world, and were probably produced by trees of several\r\ngenera (_Dadoxylon_, _Sigillaria_, _Cordaites_, etc.) (Fig. 101).\r\nCharles Brongniart has recently described no less than seventeen genera\r\nof these seeds from the coal-field of St. A%tienne alone, and it would be\r\na low estimate to say that we probably know as many as sixty or seventy\r\nspecies in all, while the trunks of great coniferous trees allied to\r\nTaxineA|, and showing well-preserved structure, are by no means uncommon\r\nin the Devonian and Carboniferous. Had these great Yews appeared for the\r\nfirst time in the Coal-formation, we might have supposed that they had\r\nbeen developed from such Lycopods as _Lepidodendra_, and that the\r\n_Cordaites_ are the intermediate forms; but unfortunately the Pines go\r\nalmost as far back in geological time as the Lycopods, and it does not\r\nhelp us, when in search of evidence of evolution, to find the link which\r\nis missing or imperfect in the Early Devonian supplied in the\r\nCoal-formation, where, for this purpose at least, it is no longer\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nWe have said something of what was in the PalA|ozoic flora; but what of\r\nthat which was not? We may answer:aEuro\"Nearly all that is characteristic of\r\nour modern forests, whether in the ordinary Exogens, which predominate\r\nso greatly in the trees and shrubs of temperate climates, or in the\r\nPalms and their allies, which figure so conspicuously within the\r\ntropics. The few rare, and to some extent doubtful, representatives of\r\nthese types scarcely deserve to be noted as exceptions. Had a botanist\r\nsearched the PalA|ozoic forests for precursors of the future, he would\r\nprobably have found only a few rare species, while he would have seen\r\nall around him the giant forms and peculiar and monotonous foliage of\r\ntribes now degraded in magnitude and structure, and of small account in\r\nthe system of nature.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the PalA|ozoic flora remained in undisturbed\r\npossession of the continents during the whole of that long period. In\r\nthe successive subsidences of the continental plateaux, in which the\r\nmarine limestones were deposited, it was to a great extent swept away,\r\nor was restricted to limited insular areas, and these more especially in\r\nthe far north, so that on re-elevation of the land it was always peopled\r\nwith northern plants. Thus there were alternate restrictions and\r\nexpansions of vegetation, and the latter were always signalised by the\r\nintroduction of new species, for here, as elsewhere, it was not\r\nstruggle, but opportunity, that favoured improvement.\r\n\r\nIn the Lower Silurian such plants as existed must have experienced great\r\nrestriction at the age of the Niagara or Wenlock limestone. Those of the\r\nUpper Silurian suffered a similar reverse at the time of the Lower\r\nHelderberg or Ludlow limestones. This recurred at the close of the\r\nDevonian and in the time of the Lower Carboniferous limestone; and\r\nfinally the PalA|ozoic flora disappeared altogether in the Permian, to be\r\nreplaced by new types in the Mesozoic. While, therefore, there is a\r\ngreat general similarity in the successive PalA|ozoic floras, there are\r\nminor differences, so that the Devonian plants are for the most part\r\ndistinct specifically from those of the Lower Carboniferous, those of\r\nthe Lower Carboniferous from those of the Coal-formation, and those of\r\nthe latter from those of the Permian.\r\n\r\nWith all these vicissitudes it is to be observed that there is no\r\napparent elevation of type in all the long ages from the Devonian to the\r\nPermian, that the Acrogens and Gymnosperms of these periods are in some\r\nrespects superior, in all respects equal, to their modern successors,\r\nand that their history shows a decadence toward the modern period; that\r\nintermediate forms arrive too late to form connecting links in time,\r\nthat several distinct types appear together at the beginning, and that\r\nall utterly and apparently simultaneously perish at the end of the\r\nPalA|ozoic, to make way for the entirely new vegetation of the succeeding\r\nage. Theories of evolution receive no support from facts like these,\r\nthough their practical significance, as parts of the one great uniform\r\nscheme of nature, is sufficiently manifest.\r\n\r\nOf what use then were these old floras? To the naturalist, vegetable\r\nlife, with regard to its modern uses, is the great accumulator of\r\npabulum for the sustenance of the higher forms of vital energy\r\nmanifested in the animal. In the PalA|ozoic this consideration sinks in\r\nimportance. In the Coal period we know few land animals, and these not\r\nvegetable feeders, with the exception of some insects, millipedes, and\r\nsnails. But the Carboniferous forests did not live in vain, if their\r\nonly use was to store up the light and heat of those old summers in the\r\nform of coal, and to remove the excess of carbonic acid from the\r\natmosphere. In the Devonian period even these utilities fail, for coal\r\ndoes not seem to have been accumulated to any great extent, and the\r\npetroleum of the Devonian appears to have been produced from aquatic\r\nvegetation. Even with reference to theories of evolution, there seems no\r\nnecessity for the long continuance and frequent changes of species of\r\nacrogenous plants without any perceptible elevation. We may have much\r\nyet to learn of the life of the Devonian; but for the present the great\r\nplan of vegetable nature goes beyond our measures of utility; and there\r\nremains only what is perhaps the most wonderful and suggestive\r\ncorrelation of all, namely, that our minds, made in the image of the\r\nCreator, are able to trace in these perished organisms structures\r\nsimilar to those of modern plants, and thus to reproduce in imagination\r\nthe forms and habits of growth of living things which so long preceded\r\nus on the earth. We may indeed proceed a step further, and hold that,\r\nindependently of human appreciation, these primitive plants commended\r\nthemselves to the approval of their Maker, and perhaps of higher\r\nintelligences unknown to us; and that in the last resort it was for His\r\npleasure that they were created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PTERASPIS. RESTORED.aEuro\"AFTER LANKESTER.]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE APPEARANCE OF VERTEBRATE ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfessedly the highest style of animal is that which possesses a skull\r\nand backbone, with brain and nerve system to match, and which embodies\r\nthe general plan of structure employed in man himself. Yet among the\r\nfishes, which constitute the lowest manifestation of this type, are some\r\nso rudimentary that the brain is scarcely developed, and the skeleton is\r\nmerely a cord of gristle. These are represented in the modern world only\r\nby the Lancelot,[33] a creature which has sometimes been mistaken for a\r\nworm, and by a slightly more advanced type, that of the Lampreys.[34] In\r\nthese animals the Vertebrates make the nearest approach to the lower\r\ndomains of the animal kingdom, collectively known as Invertebrates. We\r\nshould naturally expect that since the vertebrates succeed the inferior\r\nanimals in time, their lower types should appear first, and that these\r\nshould be aquatic rather than terrestrial. On the other hand, as the\r\noldest fishes that are certainly known are strongly protected with bony\r\narmour, and had to contend against formidable Crustaceans and Cuttles,\r\nwe might suppose that the Lancelot and the Lampreys are rather degraded\r\ntypes belonging to the modern period, than the true precursors of the\r\nother fishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.aEuro\"Siluro-Cambrian Conodonts. Magnified.aEuro\"After\r\nPander.]\r\n\r\nBut if fishes like the Lancelot preceded all others, we may never find\r\nin a fossil state any traces of their soft and perishable bodies; and\r\neven the Lampreys have no hard parts except small horny teeth, which\r\nmight easily escape observation. But palA|ontologists have sharp eyes,\r\nand it has not escaped them that certain microscopic tooth-like bodies\r\nare somewhat widely distributed in the older rocks. In Russia, Pander\r\nhas found in the Upper Cambrian and Lower Silurian, and also in the\r\nDevonian and Carboniferous, minute conical and comb-like teeth, to which\r\nhe has given the name of _Conodonts_ (Fig. 102), and which he supposes\r\nto be the teeth of ancient Lampreys. Similar teeth have been found by\r\nMoore and others in the Carboniferous of England, and by Newberry in\r\nCarboniferous shales in Ohio. In point of form, these bodies certainly\r\nresemble the teeth of the humble fishes to which they have been\r\nreferred. In the case of the Carboniferous specimens from OhioaEuro\"the only\r\nones I have had an opportunity to examinethe material is calcium\r\nphosphate, and the structures are more like those of teeth of Sharks\r\nthan of Lampreys, so that there can be no doubt that they are really\r\nteeth of fishes, and probably of fishes of somewhat higher grade than\r\nthe Lampreys.[35] The Cambrian and Silurian specimens are said to be\r\ncomposed of calcium carbonate, which would render it more probable that,\r\nas has been suggested by Prof. Owen, they may have been teeth of some\r\nspecies of Sea-snail destitute of shell. It is, however, possible that\r\nthey may have originally been horny, and that the animal matter has been\r\nreplaced by carbonate of lime. Rohon and Zittel have recently shown that\r\nmany of these are more allied to the teeth of worms than of any other\r\nanimals.[36]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.aEuro\"Lower Carboniferous Conodont.\r\nMagnified.aEuro\"After Newberry.]\r\n\r\nIf these older Conodonts were really teeth of fishes, they carry the\r\nintroduction of these nearly as far back as that of the Mollusks and\r\nCrustaceans. If they were not, then the earliest known representatives\r\nof this class belong to a much later age, that of the Silurian. Here we\r\nhave undoubted remains of fishes belonging to two of the higher orders\r\nof the class; and in the succeeding Devonian these became multiplied and\r\nextended exceedingly.\r\n\r\nBesides the inferior tribes already referred to, the modern seas and\r\nrivers present four leading types of fishes:aEuro\"first, the ordinary bony\r\nfishes (Teleostians), such as the Cod, Salmon, and Herring; secondly,\r\nthe Ganoid fishes, protected with bony plates on the skin, as the\r\nBony-pike[37] and Sturgeon; thirdly, the Sharks and their allies, the\r\nDog-fishes and Rays; fourthly, the peculiar and at present rare group of\r\nsemi-reptilian fishes to which the name of _Dipnoi_ has been given, on\r\naccount of their capacity for breathing both in air and in water.\r\n\r\nOf these four types the first is altogether modern, and includes the\r\ngreat majority of our present fishes. It does not make its appearance\r\ntill the Cretaceous age, and then is at once represented by at least\r\nthree of the modern families, those of the Salmon, Herring, and Perch.\r\nThe history of the other three groups is precisely the opposite of this.\r\nThey abound exceedingly at an early period, and dwindle to a much\r\nsmaller number in the modern time. This is especially the case with the\r\nGanoids and the Dipnoi. It is also remarkable that these groups of\r\nold-fashioned fishes[38] are in some respects the highest members of the\r\nclass, approaching the nearest to the reptiles; but this accords with a\r\nwell-known palA|ontological law, namely, that the higher members of low\r\ngroups give way on the introduction of more elevated types, while the\r\nlower members may continue. Thus the decadence of these higher fish\r\nbegins with the incoming of the reptiles, just as the decadence of the\r\nhigher Mollusks and predaceous Crustaceans began with the incoming of\r\nthe fishes. Further, the modern Ganoids and Dipnoi are mostly\r\nfresh-water animals, though the Sharks are largely pelagic. In the\r\nPalA|ozoic there seem to have been abundance of marine species of all\r\nthese types; but though marine, they probably flourished most in bays\r\nand estuaries and on shallow banks; and the existence of these implies\r\ncontinental masses of land. This explains the curious coincidence that\r\nthe introduction of fishes and of an abundant land flora synchronise,\r\nand that the ocean was still dominated by Invertebrates long after the\r\nfishes had become supreme in bays, estuaries, and rivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.aEuro\"_a_, Head-shield of an Upper Silurian fish\r\n(_Cyathaspis_). _b_, Spine of a Silurian Shark (_Onchus tenui-striatus_,\r\nAgass.). _c_, _d_, Scales of _Thecodus_, enlarged.]\r\n\r\nThe first fishes that we certainly know are the Ganoids and Sharks,\r\nwhich appear near the close of the Upper Silurian, in the English Ludlow\r\nfor example (Fig. 104). The Ganoids found here all belong to an extinct\r\ngroup, characterised by the covering of the head and anterior part of\r\nthe body with large bony plates. They are mostly small fishes, and\r\nprobably fed at the bottom, and used their long or rounded bony snouts\r\nfor grubbing in the mud for food. In this respect they present a\r\nsingular resemblance to the Trilobites, so that we seem to have here\r\nanimals of an entirely new type, the Vertebrate, and with bony instead\r\nof shelly coverings, taking up the _rA'le_ and, to some extent, the\r\nexternal form of a group about to pass away. Yet I presume that no\r\nderivationist would be hardy enough to affirm that the Trilobites could\r\nhave been the ancestors of these fishes. Nor indeed is any ancestry even\r\nhypothetically known for them, for the doubtful Lampreys of the Cambrian\r\nSilurian are too remote and uncertain to be used in that way. The\r\nhead-shield copied in outline in Fig. 104, and the restoration after\r\nLankester in the frontispiece to this chapter, may serve to represent\r\nthese curious primitive Ganoids, which are continued in the Devonian\r\nfishes represented in Figs. 105, 106.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.aEuro\"_Cephalaspis Dawsoni_ (Lankester). Lower\r\nDevonian of GaspA(C).]\r\n\r\nAlong with these, and not improbably their enemies, were certain Sharks\r\n(Fig. 104), known to us only by the spines which were attached to their\r\nfins as weapons of defence, and by detached bony tubercles which\r\nprotected their skin. These remains are chiefly interesting as\r\nindications that two of the great leading divisions of the class of\r\nfishes originated together.\r\n\r\nIn the Devonian age the Ganoids and Sharks, thus introduced in the\r\nSilurian, may be said to culminate. The former, more especially, are\r\nrepresented by a great variety of species, some of them nearly allied to\r\ntheir Silurian predecessors (Fig. 106), others of forms and structure\r\nnot dissimilar to those of the few surviving representatives of the\r\norder, or altogether peculiar to the Devonian (Fig. 107). So numerous\r\nare these fishes, and of so many genera and speciesaEuro\"and this not merely\r\nin one region, but in widely separated parts of the worldaEuro\"that the\r\nDevonian has not inaptly been called the reign of Ganoids. As an\r\nillustration at once of the very peculiar forms of some of these fishes\r\nand of their wide distribution, I figure here along with the British\r\nspecies a _Cephalaspis_ (Fig. 105) found in the Lower Devonian of GaspA(C),\r\nin the same beds with some of the antique Devonian plants described in\r\nthe last chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.aEuro\"Devonian Placoganoid Fishes (_Pterichthys\r\ncornutus_, _Cephalaspis Lyelli_), from Scotland.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.aEuro\"Devonian Lepidoganoid Fishes (_Diplacanthus_\r\nand _Osteolepis_).

Australia. _b_, _Lepidosiren annectus_.\r\nAfrica.]\r\n\r\nA new and interesting light has recently been cast upon some of the most\r\nanomalous of the ancient fishes by the study of the now rare and\r\npeculiar species of the group of Dipnoi. Two of these, belonging to the\r\ngenus _Lepidosiren_, are the aEurooeMud-fishesaEuroŁ of the rivers of tropical\r\nAfrica and America (Fig. 108, _b._) These creatures have an elongated\r\nand elegant form, and the body is covered with overlapping horny scales\r\nlike those of ordinary fishes; but the pectoral and ventral fins are\r\nrod-like, and are supported by simple cartilaginous rays, while the\r\ntailfin forms a fringe around the posterior part of the body. Unlike\r\nordinary fishes, they have lungs as well as gills, and their mouths are\r\narmed with sharp, bony, beak-like teeth (Fig. 115), with which they can\r\ninflict terrible bites on the small fishes and frogs which furnish them\r\nwith food. Their most remarkable habit is that of burying themselves in\r\nthe mud of dried-up ponds, thus forming a sort of water-chamber or\r\naEurooecocoon,aEuroŁ in which they remain in a torpid state until the return of the\r\nrainy season sets them free.\r\n\r\nAnother example of these Dipnoi is the Barramunda, or _Ceratodus_ of the\r\nAustralian rivers (Fig. 108_a_). This fish resembles the _Lepidosiren_ in\r\nmany essential points of structure; but its fins have lateral rays, and\r\nare consequently of some breadth, though of peculiar form, and its mouth\r\nis armed with flat, pavement-like teeth, wherewith it browses on aquatic\r\ngrasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.aEuro\"Anterior part of the palate of _Dipterus_.\r\nShowing the dental plates at _a_, Devonian.aEuro\"After Traquair.]\r\n\r\nThese modern fishes have enabled us to understand several mysterious\r\nforms met with in the older rocks. In the first place, they show the\r\nmeaning of certain flat-toothed fishes, like _Dipterus_ of the Devonian\r\n(Fig. 109), _Conchodus_ of the Carboniferous (Fig. 110), and _Ceratodus_\r\nof the Carboniferous and Trias (Figs. 111, 112), previously of very\r\ndoubtful character. These must all have been of similar structure and\r\nhabits with the Barramunda, which is thus the sole survivor, perhaps\r\nitself verging on extinction, of a group of herbivorous fishes\r\nintroduced, it may be, contemporaneously with the first stream affording\r\nthe requisite vegetable food, and which have continued almost without\r\nimprovement or deterioration to the present time. These fishes are,\r\nhowever, very closely connected with the Ganoids, and there are some of\r\nthese, with fringed fins and overlapping scales, which, while regarded\r\nas true Ganoids, resemble the Dipnoi very closely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.aEuro\"Dental plate of _Conchodus plicatus_ (Dn.).\r\nCoal-formation of Nova Scotia. _Acadian Geology_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.aEuro\"Dental plate of _Ceratodus Barrandii_.\r\nCoal-formation of Bohemia.

From the\r\nTrias.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.aEuro\"Jaws of _Dinichthys Hertzeri_ (Newberry).\r\nLaterally compressed; one-sixth natural size.]\r\n\r\nAgain, certain huge fishes, whose remains are found in the Devonian of\r\nOhio,[39] had jaws on the same plan with those of _Lepidosiren_, but of\r\nenormous size and strength (Figs. 113, 114, 115), so that in this and\r\nsome other points of structure they may be regarded as colossal\r\nMud-fishes, and they must have had the same destructive powers, but on a\r\nfar grander scale. They were besides clothed with heavy armour of bony\r\nscales, having some resemblance to that of those mailed fishes of\r\nsmaller size already referred to, and indicating that, huge though they\r\nwere, and formidable in destructive power, they also had enemies to be\r\ndreaded. These plates serve to ally them with the Ganoids, as their jaws\r\ndo with _Lepidosiren_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.aEuro\"Lower Jaw of _Dinichthys Hertzeri_. One-sixth\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.aEuro\"Jaws of _Lepidosiren_. Natural size.aEuro\"After\r\nNewberry.]\r\n\r\nWe are thus enabled to see in the streams, lakes, and bays of the\r\nPalA|ozoic, harmless fishes, of the type of _Ceratodus_, feeding on plants,\r\nand huge precursors of the Mud-fishes darting from the depths, and\r\nprovided with a dental apparatus more formidable than that of any modern\r\nfish, sufficient to pierce the strongest armour of the Ganoids, and to\r\ndestroy and devour the largest aquatic animals. These huge fishes, armed\r\nwith shears two or three feet in length, and capable of cutting asunder\r\nscale, flesh, and bone, are the _beau idA(C)al_ of destructive monsters of\r\nthe deep, far surpassing our modern Sharks; and if, by means of\r\nsupplementary lungs, they could breathe in air as well as in water, they\r\nwould on that account be all the more vigorous and voracious.\r\n\r\nNewberry has well remarked that while in the Devonian the Ganoids and\r\nDipnoi were the real tyrants of the sea, as well as of the streams, in\r\nthe Carboniferous they already diminish in size, though still abundant\r\nas to numbers, and are more limited to estuaries and fresh waters. Thus\r\ntheir departure from power had already begun, and went on until in\r\nmodern times the proportion of Ganoids to ordinary fishes is, according\r\nto GA1/4nther, nine out of 9,000. The Carboniferous, indeed, very specially\r\nabounds in small Ganoids, though there are many large and formidable\r\nspecies. One of these smaller species, a very beautiful little fish, of\r\nfresh-water ponds and streams in the older part of the Carboniferous\r\nage, is represented of the natural size in Fig. 116, and is not a\r\nrestoration, being found preserved entire, though flattened, in a fine\r\nbituminous shale, which has perfectly preserved even the most delicate\r\nsculpturing of its bony scales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.aEuro\"A small Carboniferous Ganoid (_PalA|oniscus\r\n(Rhadinichthys) Modulus_ Dn.).

In the\r\nCarboniferous, however, there is a great preponderance of those species\r\nwith flat, crushing teeth fitted for grinding shells,[40] which in\r\ndiminishing numbers continue up to the present time, when they are\r\nrepresented by the Port Jackson Shark and a few other species. The\r\nincrease toward the modern time of the true Sharks[41] with sharp\r\ncutting teeth, is obviously related to the increase of the ordinary\r\nfishes which furnish them with food. Another curious difference,\r\nconnected probably with the same circumstance, is the fact that in the\r\nsharp toothed Sharks of the Carboniferous the two side fangs of each\r\ntooth are the largest, or are exclusively developed (Fig. 117, _a_),\r\nwhile in later periods the central point becomes dominant, or is\r\ndeveloped to the exclusion of the others (Figs. 118, 119).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.aEuro\"Teeth of Cretaceous Sharks (_Otodus_ and\r\n_Ptychodus_).aEuro\"After Leidy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.aEuro\"Tooth of a Tertiary Shark (_Carcharodon_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.aEuro\"A Liassic Ganoid (_Dapedius_).\r\nRestored.aEuro\"After Nicholson.]\r\n\r\nThe Ganoids and Dipnoi still, however, occupy a very important place\r\nthrough the Mesozoic ages (Fig. 120), and it is only at the close of the\r\nCretaceous that they finally give place to the Teleosts, or common\r\nfishes, which, though perhaps more fully specialised in purely ichthyic\r\nfeatures, have dropped the reptilian characteristics of their\r\npredecessors (Fig. 121). It is interesting to observe that these\r\nold-fashioned fishes had culminated before the advent of air-breathing\r\nVertebrates, which appear for the first time in the Carboniferous. It is\r\nfurther to be observed that groups of fishes furnished with means of\r\naiding their gills by rudimentary lungs were especially suited to waters\r\nmore charged with carbonic acid, and less with free oxygen, than those\r\nof more recent times. This remark especially applies to the mephitic and\r\nsluggish streams and lagoons of the Carboniferous swamps, where, in the\r\nmidst of a rank vegetation and reeking masses of decaying organic\r\nmatter, the half air-breathing fishes and the amphibious reptilian\r\nanimals met with each other and found equally congenial abodes. Thus,\r\nindependently of the fact that some of these fishes were probably\r\nvegetable feeders, it is not altogether an accident, but a wise\r\nadaptation, that caused the culmination of the reptilian fishes and\r\nbatrachian reptiles to coincide with the enormous development of the\r\nlower forms of land-plants in the Devonian and Carboniferous. Another\r\ncurious illustration of the diminishing necessity for air-breathing to\r\nthe fishes, is the change of the tail from the unequally-lobed or\r\nheterocercal form, which prevailed in the PalA|ozoic, to the more modern\r\nequally-lobed (homocercal) style in the Mesozoic. The former is better\r\nsuited to animals which have to rise rapidly to the surface for air, and\r\nis still continued in some modern fishes, which for other reasons need\r\nto ascend and descend, or to turn themselves in the water; but the\r\nhomocercal form is best suited to the ordinary fish, whether Ganoids or\r\nTeleosts (Fig. 122). It is curious also to find the beginning of the\r\ndominancy of the ordinary fish to coincide with that of the broad-leaved\r\nexogenous trees in the later Cretaceous, and to precede immediately the\r\nappearance of the mammals on the land; all these changes being related\r\nto the purer air, the clearer waters, and the more varied continental\r\nprofiles of the later geological periods. Thus physical improvement and\r\nthe changes of animal and vegetable life are linked together by\r\ncorrelations which imply not only design, but prescience, whether we\r\nattribute these qualities to a spiritual Creator or to mere atoms and\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.aEuro\"Cretaceous Fishes of the modern or Teleostian\r\ntype.\r\n\r\n_a_, _Beryx Lewesiensis_. English chalk. _b_, _Portheus molossus_\r\n(Cope). A large fish from the American Cretaceous. One twenty-eighth\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\nThe history of fishes extends further through geological time than that\r\nof any other Vertebrates, and is perhaps more completely known to us, in\r\nconsequence of the greater facilities for the preservation of their\r\nremains in aqueous deposits. If we receive PanderaEuro(TM)s Conodonts as\r\nindicating a low type of cartilaginous fishes, these must have\r\ncontinued for vast ages without any elevation, and struggling for a bare\r\nexistence amidst formidable Cuttle-fishes and Crustaceans, before, under\r\nmore favourable conditions, they suddenly expanded into the high and\r\nperfect types of Ganoids and Sharks. If we reject the early Conodonts,\r\nthen the two last-mentioned types spring together and suddenly into\r\nexistence, like the armed men from the dragonaEuro(TM)s teeth of Cadmus. They\r\nrapidly attain to numbers and grandeur unexampled in later times, and\r\nbecome the lords of the waters at the time when there was probably no\r\nVertebrate life on the land. As the reptiles establish themselves on the\r\nland and in the waters, the Ganoids diminish, but the Sharks hold their\r\nown. At length the reign of reptiles is over, but the Ganoids, instead\r\nof resuming their pristine numbers, give place to the Teleosts, and\r\nbecome reduced to insignificance; while the Sharks, profiting by the\r\ndecadence of the great marine reptiles, remain the tyrants of the seas.\r\nThis history is strangely unlike a continuous evolution; but we are\r\nanticipating facts which will fall to be discussed in a subsequent\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.aEuro\"Modern Ganoids (_Polypterus._ Africa.\r\n_Lepidosteus._ America).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MICROSAURIAN OF THE CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD (_Hylonomus\r\nLyelli_). RESTORED FROM THE SKELETON AND DERMAL APPENDAGES FOUND IN AN\r\nERECT SIGILLARIA. HALF NATURAL SIZE.]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST AIR-BREATHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere our experience limited to the animals whose remains are found in\r\nthe earlier PalA|ozoic rocks, we might be unable to conceive the\r\npossibility of an animal capable of living and breathing in the thin and\r\napparently uncongenial medium of air. More especially would this appear\r\ndoubtful if our experience of the atmosphere presented it to us as\r\nloaded with carbonic acid, and less rich in vital air than it is at\r\npresent. Even the mechanical difficulties of the case might strike us as\r\nconsiderable, in our ignorance of the capabilities of limbs. Still, as\r\ntime wore on, we should find this problem worked out along three\r\ndistinct lines of advancementaEuro\"those of the Mollusk, the Arthropod, and\r\nthe Vertebrate, and in each of these with different machinery, related\r\nto the previous locomotive and water-breathing apparatus of the type.\r\n\r\nRespiration under water depends, not on the water itself, but on the\r\nsmall percentage of free oxygen which it contains, and this is utilised\r\nfor the aA\"ration of the blood of animals, by that wonderful and often\r\nextremely beautiful apparatus of delicate fibres or laminA| penetrated\r\nwith blood-vessels, which we call a gill. Except those lowest creatures\r\nwhich aA\"rate their blood merely at the general surface of the body, all\r\nanimals capable of respiration in water are provided with gills in some\r\nform, though in many of the humbler types, like that of the familiar\r\nOyster, the gills are used for the double purpose of aA\"rating the blood\r\nand, by their minute vibrating threads or cilia, drifting food to the\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nIn the great group of radiated animals, the _Protozoa_, _CA\"lenterata_,\r\nand _Echinodermata_, no air-breathing creature exists, or, in so far as\r\nis known, has existed, so that this vast group of animals is limited\r\naltogether to the waters; and this is undoubtedly one mark of its\r\ninferiority.\r\n\r\nIn the sub-kingdom of the Mollusks the highest class, that of the\r\nCuttle-fishes and Nautili, has been, singularly enough, rejected as\r\nunfit for this promotion, though it was early introduced, and attains to\r\na high development of muscular energy and nervous power. The group next\r\nin order, that of the Snails and their allies, alone ventures in some of\r\nits families to assume the _rA'le_ of air-breathing. As might be\r\nexpected, in creatures of this stamp the simplest means are employed to\r\neffect the result. In the sub-aquatic species the gills are contained in\r\na chamber, where they are protected and kept supplied with water. In the\r\nair-breathing species, this gill-chamber is merely emptied of its\r\ncontents and converted into an air-sac or functional lung. Thus a rude\r\nand imperfect method of air-breathing is contrived, which scarcely\r\nseparates the animals that possess it from their aquatic relatives, but\r\nwhich nevertheless gives to us the beautiful and varied groups of the\r\nLand-snails and of the air-breathing fresh-water Snails.\r\n\r\nIn the worms and Crustaceans the gills are placed at the sides of the\r\nbody, and connected with its several segments. But the Crustaceans, like\r\nthe Cuttle-fishes, though the highest aquatic type, never become\r\nair-breathers. It is true some of them, like the Land-crabs, live in the\r\nair; but they retain their gills, and have to carry with them a supply\r\nof water to keep these moist.\r\n\r\nBut in order to elevate the Annulose type to the true dignity of air\r\nbreathing, three new classes had to be introduced, differing altogether\r\nin their details of structure; and all three seem to have been placed on\r\nthe earth about the same time. They are: First, the Myriapods, or\r\nGallyworms and Centipedes; secondly, the Insects; and thirdly, the\r\nArachnidans, or Spiders and Scorpions.\r\n\r\nIn the Myriapods a system of air-tubes, kept open by elastic spiral\r\nfibres, penetrates the body by lateral pores, thus retaining the\r\nresemblance to the lateral respiration of the Crustaceans and worms. In\r\nthe Insects, where this type of structure rises to its highest\r\nmechanical perfection, and where the animal is enabled to be not merely\r\nan air-breather, but a flier, the same system of lateral pores and\r\ninternal air-tubes is adopted, and is so extended and ramified as to\r\ngive a very perfect respiration. In the Spiders and Scorpions the system\r\nis the same, except that in the latter and a part of the former the\r\nwhole or a part of the tracheal system becomes expanded into\r\nair-chambers simulating true lungs.\r\n\r\nAmong the Vertebrates, the fishes are breathers by gills attached to\r\narches at the sides of the neck. But already in the Devonian we have\r\nreason to believe that there were fishes having the swimming-bladder\r\nopening into the back of the mouth to receive air, and divided into\r\nchambers, so as to constitute an imperfect lung. And here we have not,\r\nas in the lower types, an adaptation of the old water-breathing organs,\r\nbut an entirely new apparatus. In the next grade of Vertebrates we find,\r\nas in the Frogs, Water-lizards, etc., that the young are aquatic and\r\nbreathe by gills, while the adults acquire lungs, sometimes retaining\r\ntheir gills also, but in the higher forms parting with them. Thus in the\r\nvertebrates alone we have true lungs, distinct structurally from gills;\r\nand these lungs attain to their highest perfection in the birds and\r\nmammals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.aEuro\"Wings of Devonian Insects. Middle Devonian of\r\nNew Brunswick.\r\n\r\n  _a_, _Platephemera antiqua_ (Scudder).\r\n  _b_, _Homothetus fossilis_ (Scudder).\r\n  _c_, _Lithentomum Harttii_ (Scudder).\r\n  _d_, _Xenoneura antiquorum_ (Scudder).]\r\n\r\nThe oldest air breathers at present known are Scorpions and insects\r\nallied to the modern May-flies, which have been found in the Silurian.\r\nNext to these, and more important in number and variety, are the\r\ninsects of the Erian plant beds of New Brunswick. They were discovered\r\nby the late lamented Prof. C. F. Hartt in the plant-bearing shales of\r\nthe Middle Devonian (Fig. 123). The beds containing them hold also a\r\nspecies of _Eurypterus_, an obscure Trilobite, and a Crustacean allied\r\nto the modern Stomapods,[42] besides a shell which may possibly be that\r\nof a Land-snail, to be mentioned in the sequel. They are also\r\nexceedingly rich in beautifully-preserved remains of Devonian plants.\r\nThe collection made by Prof. Hartt is limited to a few fragments of\r\nwings; but these, in the skilful hands of Mr. Scudder, have proved to be\r\nrich in geological interest. One is a gigantic _Ephemera_ or May-fly,\r\nwhich must have been five inches in the expanse of the wings, which are\r\nmore complex in their venation than those of its modern allies (Fig.\r\n123, _a_). Another presents peculiarities between those of the May-flies\r\nand Dragon-flies (Fig. 123, _b_). A third is a Neuropter, not belonging\r\nto any known family, but allied to some in the Coal-formation (Fig. 123,\r\n_c_). A fourth (Fig. 123, _d_) is a small and delicate wing, supposed\r\nto have belonged to an animal having some points of resemblance to the\r\nmodern crickets. Two others are represented by mere fragments of wings,\r\ninsufficient to determine their affinities with certainty. No other\r\ninsects of this age have been discovered elsewhere; but it is to be\r\nborne in mind that no other locality rich in Devonian plants has\r\nprobably been so thoroughly explored. The hard slaty ridges containing\r\nthese fossils are well exposed on the coast near the city of St. John,\r\nand Messrs. Hartt and Matthew of that city, acting, I believe, in\r\nconcert with and aided by the Natural History Society of the place, not\r\nonly searched superficially, but removed by blasting large portions of\r\nthe richest beds, and examined every fragment with the greatest care.\r\nTheir primary object was fossil plants, of which they obtained\r\nmagnificent collections; and it is scarcely possible that the insects\r\ncould have been found but for the exhaustive methods of exploration\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe, respecting these oldest insects, that they\r\nall belong to those families which have jaws, and not suctorial\r\napparatus, that they are not of those which undergo a complete\r\nmetamorphosis, and that their modern congeners pass their larval stage\r\nin the water. Thus the waters gave birth to the first insects, and their\r\nearliest families were not of those which suck honied juices or the\r\nblood of animals, or which pass through a worm-like infancy. These\r\ngroups belong apparently to much later times.\r\n\r\nOn one of the specimens collected by Messrs. Hartt and Matthew, and\r\nplaced by them in my hands, is a spiral form which in every particular\r\nof external marking resembles a genus of modern West Indian\r\nLand-snails.[43] I have hesitated to describe it, as the structure is\r\nlost and the form imperfect; but I cannot help regarding it as an\r\nindication that this group of land animals also will be traced back to\r\nthe Devonian age.\r\n\r\nAscending from the Devonian to the Carboniferous, we at once find\r\nourselves in the midst of air-breathers of various types. Here are\r\nMyriapods, insects of several orders, Spiders, Scorpions, Land-snails,\r\nand Batrachian reptiles, and these of many species, and found in many\r\nlocalities widely separated. We can thus people those dark, luxuriant\r\nforests, to which we owe our most valuable beds of coal, with many forms\r\nof life; and as most of these belong to tribes likely to multiply\r\nabundantly where food was plentiful, we can imagine multitudes of Snails\r\nand Millepedes feeding on succulent or decaying vegetable matter, swarms\r\nof insects flitting through the air in the sunnier spots, while their\r\nlarvA| luxuriated in decaying masses of leaves or wood, or peopled the\r\npools and streams. In like manner, in imagination we can render these\r\nold woods vocal with the trill of crickets and with the piping or\r\nbooming of smaller and larger Batrachians. Let us now, in accordance\r\nwith our plan, inquire as to the nature of these early air-breathers and\r\nthe fortunes of their families in the geological history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.aEuro\"Land-snail (_Pupa vetusta_, Dawson).

Enlarged; the line below shows the natural size. _b_,\r\nSculpture. Enlarged.]\r\n\r\nThe Land-snails known as yet in the Carboniferous are limited to five or\r\nsix species, belonging to four genera, all American and related to\r\nexisting American forms. The two earliest known are represented in Figs.\r\n124 and 125.[44] One of them is a _Pupa_, or elongated Land-snail, so\r\nsimilar to modern forms that it does not merit a generic distinction,\r\nand is indeed very near to some existing West Indian species. The other\r\nis in like manner a member of the modern genus _Zonites_. These are from\r\nthe Coal-formation of Nova Scotia, and the Pupa must have been very\r\nabundant, as it has been found in considerable numbers in a layer of\r\nshale, and in the stumps of erect trees, in beds separated from each\r\nother by a thickness of 2,000 feet of strata. The _Zonites_ is much more\r\nrare. A second Pupa is found in Nova Scotia, and two species occur in\r\nthe Coal-field of Illinois. One of these is a Pupa still smaller than\r\n_P. vetusta_, and, like some modern species, with a tooth-like process\r\non the inner lip. The other has been placed in a new genus,[45] but is\r\nvery near to some of the smaller American Snails still living. Its most\r\nspecial character is a plate extending from the inner lip over half the\r\naperture, a contrivance for protection still seen in some modern forms.\r\nThus the Land-snails come on the stage in at least three generic forms,\r\nsimilar to those which still live, but all of small size, indicating\r\nperhaps that the conditions were less favourable for such creatures than\r\nthose of the temperate and warmer climates at present. It may seem a\r\nsmall step in advance for Sea-snails to lose their gills and to become\r\nLand-snails, and this without any elevation of their general structure;\r\nbut it must be borne in mind that we have here not only the dropping of\r\nthe gills for an air-sac, but profound changes in teeth, mucous glands,\r\nshell, and other particulars, to fit them for new food and new habits.\r\nIt is also singular that the Land-snails at once appear instead of the\r\nintermediate forms of the air-breathing fresh-water snails. These last\r\nmay, however, yet be found.\r\n\r\nThe Millepedes, like the Land-snails, were first found in the\r\nCoal-formation of Nova Scotia, but species have since been discovered\r\nnot only in Illinois, but also in Great Britain and in Bohemia. In Nova\r\nScotia alone two genera and five distinct species have been found, all\r\nin the interior of erect trees, to which these creatures probably\r\nresorted for food and shelter (Fig. 126). All the species yet known are\r\nallied to the modern Gallyworms, though presenting special features\r\nwhich seem to separate them as a distinct family,[46] and were probably\r\nvegetable-feeders. Some of the species have the peculiarity, unknown\r\namong their modern successors, of being armed with long spines.[47] The\r\nmoist, equable climate and exuberant vegetation of the Coal-period would\r\nnaturally be very favourable to Millepedes, and it is likely that the\r\ndiscoveries made as yet give but a faint idea of their actual abundance.\r\nIt is not improbable that they subsequently declined, as we know of none\r\nbetween the Carboniferous and the Jurassic, and they do not seem to have\r\nimproved up to the modern period. The Carnivorous Myriapods, however, or\r\nCentipedes proper, a higher and essentially distinct type, are not known\r\nuntil much more recent times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.aEuro\"Millepedes.

Enlarged.]\r\n\r\nThe insects of the Carboniferous as yet known, belong to three out of\r\nthe ten or more orders into which the class is divided. One of these is\r\nrepresented by a number of species of Cockroach, another by May-flies\r\nand a Dragon-fly, and another by some weevil-like Beetles. The Cockroach\r\nis characterised by Huxley as one of the aEurooeoldest, least modified, and in\r\nmany ways most instructive forms of insects;aEuroŁ and both he and Rolleston\r\ntake its anatomy as typical of that of the class. That these creatures\r\nshould have abounded in the Coal-period we need not wonder, when we\r\nconsider the habits of those that infest our houses, and when we further\r\nbear in mind the number of species, some of them two inches in length,\r\nthat exist in tropical climates. So many species of this family have\r\nbeen found in the Coal-formation on both sides of the Atlantic,[48] that\r\nwe may fairly regard them as constituting one of its most characteristic\r\nfeatures, and as probably the oldest representatives of the order to\r\nwhich they belong[49] (Fig. 127). There were also in the Coal-period\r\ninsects allied to the Locusts and to the Mantids, a carnivorous group.\r\nOne of the latter (_Lithomantis_), described by Woodward, is a\r\nmagnificent insect, not unlike some modern tropical species. It was\r\nfound in the Coal-formation of Scotland. A still larger species,\r\nprobably the largest insect known, has been described by Brongniart. The\r\nMay-flies (_EphemeridA|_) are represented in the Carboniferous by several\r\nvery large species. That of which the wing is shown in Fig. 128 must\r\nhave been seven inches in expanse of wings. The habits of the modern\r\nMay-flies show us how animals of this group, living as larvA| in the\r\nstreams and lakes, must have afforded large supplies of food to fishes,\r\nand when mature must have emerged from the waters in countless myriads,\r\nfilling the air for the brief term of their existence in the perfect\r\nstate. The May-flies represent another insect order.[50] The\r\nCoal-measures of Saarbruck have afforded several species allied to the\r\nwhite ants (_Termites_), insects which must have found abundant scope\r\nfor their activity in the dead trees of the carboniferous forests. The\r\noccurrence of beetles,[51] especially of the weevil family, which have\r\nas yet been found only in Europe, might have been expected, considering\r\nthe habits and modern distribution of this group. It has been asserted\r\nthat moths[52] have been found in the Carboniferous; but the proof of\r\nthis, so far as known to me, is the occurrence of leaves, noticed by\r\nSternberg, with markings similar to those made by the larvA| of minute\r\nleaf-mining moths. This, however, is uncertain evidence. If we consider\r\nthe orders of insects not found in the Coal-formation, we can perceive\r\ngood reasons for the absence of some of them. Those containing the lice\r\nand fleas, and other minute and parasitic insects, we can scarcely\r\nexpect to find. The bees and wasps, and the butterflies and moths, are\r\nlittle likely to have been present where there were scarcely any\r\nflowering plants; but such groups as those of the two-winged flies, the\r\nplant-bugs and the ants, we might have expected, but for the fact of\r\ntheir being highly specialised forms, and for that reason likely to have\r\nappeared later.[53] There are, indeed, as yet no haustellate or\r\nsuctorial insects known in this early period. Plausible theories of the\r\nphylogeny of insects are not wanting; but they do not well suit the\r\nknown facts as to their first appearance; and perhaps we may venture\r\nwithout much blame to apply to the insects of the Coal-period the remark\r\nmade by Wollaston with reference to the rich insect fauna of the\r\nisolated rock of St. Helena: aEurooeTo a mind which, like my own, can accept\r\nthe doctrine of creative acts as not necessarily aEuro~unphilosophical,aEuro(TM) the\r\nmysteries [of the existence of these species in an island so remote from\r\nother lands], however great, become at least conceivable; but those\r\nwhich are not able to do this may, perhaps, succeed in elaborating some\r\nspecial theory of their own, which, even if it does not satisfy all the\r\nrequirements of the problem, may at least prove convincing to\r\nthemselves.aEuroŁ\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.aEuro\"Wings of Cockroaches.

From Colorado.]\r\n\r\nThe suctorial insects make their first certain appearance in the\r\nJurassic; and the magnificent Sphinx Moth in Fig. 129 is an example of\r\nthe magnitude and perfection to which that tribe attained in the age of\r\nthe Solenhofen slate; though Weyenburgh, who describes it, fancies that\r\nhe sees evidence that it may, unlike any modern moths, have been\r\nprovided with a sting. The most perfect and beautiful fossil butterfly\r\nknown to me is that represented in Fig. 130, from a photograph kindly\r\ngiven to me by Mr. Scudder. It is from the Tertiary rocks of Western\r\nAmerica, and is laid out in stone as neatly as if prepared by an\r\nentomologist, while its preservation is so perfect that even the\r\nmicroscopic scales on the wings can be made out. It belongs to one of\r\nthe highest types of modern butterflies, that to which the _VanessA|_\r\nbelong, but with some points of structure pointing to the lower group of\r\nthe aEurooeSkippersaEuroŁ (_HesperiadA|_). Scudder remarks that while the fore-wings\r\nresemble those of the former group, the hind-wings look more like those\r\nof the latter; and this seems to be a common character of two or three\r\nothers of the few fossil species known, none of which are older than the\r\nTertiary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.aEuro\"Abdominal part of a Carboniferous\r\nScorpion.[54]]\r\n\r\nWe know too little of the spiders and scorpions of the Carboniferous to\r\nsay more than that they closely resemble modern forms. Two of the\r\nscorpions are represented in Figs. 131 and 132; and the only spider\r\ncertainly known, which is from Silesia, is said to belong to the group\r\nof the hunting or trap-door spiders (_Lycosa_).[55]\r\n\r\nThe Batrachians of the Coal are its most characteristic and remarkable\r\nair-breathers,aEuro\"especially so as the precursors of the reptiles of the\r\nMesozoic age. Cope in a recent summary enumerates no less than\r\nthirty-nine genera and about one hundred species; and to these have to\r\nbe added at least a dozen more recently discovered in Europe; though it\r\nwas only in 1841 that the first indications of such creatures were\r\nfound, and were then regarded by geologists with the same scepticism\r\nwhich some of them still apply to _Eozoon_. The first trace ever observed\r\nof batrachians in the Carboniferous consisted of a series of small but\r\nwell-marked footprints found by the late Sir W. E. Logan in the Lower\r\nCarboniferous shales of Horton Bluff, in Nova Scotia. In that year this\r\npainstaking geologist had examined the coal-fields of Pennsylvania and\r\nNova Scotia, with the view of following up his important discovery of\r\nthe _StigmariA|_, or roots of _Sigillaria_, as accompaniments of the\r\ncoal-underclays. On his return he read a paper, detailing his\r\nobservations, before the Geological Society of London. In this he\r\nmentioned the footprints in question; but the paper was published only\r\nin abstract, and the importance of the discovery was overlooked for a\r\ntime, the anatomists evidently being shy to acknowledge the validity of\r\nthe evidence for a fact so unexpected. Fig. 133 is a representation of\r\nanother slab subsequently found in beds of the same age in Nova Scotia,\r\nand which may serve to indicate the nature of Sir WilliamaEuro(TM)s discovery.\r\nIn consequence of the neglect of this first hint by the London\r\ngeologists, the discovery of bones of a batrachian by von Dechen at\r\nSaarbruck in 1844, and that of footprints by King in Pennsylvania in the\r\nsame year, are usually represented as the first facts of this kind. My\r\nown earliest discovery of reptilian bones in Nova Scotia was made in\r\n1844, though not published till some time afterward, and was followed\r\nup by further collections in company with Sir Charles Lyell in 1851, at\r\nwhich time also the earliest land-snail was found, and in the following\r\nyear the first millepede. Since that time the progress of discovery has\r\nbeen astonishingly rapid, and has extended over most of the principal\r\ncoal-areas on both sides of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.aEuro\"Carboniferous Scorpion (_Eoscorpius\r\ncarbonarius_, Meek and Worthen). Illinois.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.aEuro\"Footprints of one of the oldest known\r\nBatrachians, probably a species of _Dendrerpeton_.

Upper figure natural size.]\r\n\r\nWe may, for convenience, call these animals reptiles, but they are\r\nregarded as belonging to that lower grade of reptilian animals, the\r\nAmphibians or Batrachians, which includes the modern frogs and newts and\r\nwater-lizards.[56] Still it would be doing great injustice to the\r\ncarboniferous reptiles not to say, that while related to this low type,\r\nthey presented a much greater range of organisation than it shows at\r\npresent, evincing a capability to fill most of the places now occupied\r\nby the true reptiles. Some of them were aquatic, and with limbs\r\nrudimentary or little developed, but many of them walked on the land,\r\nand were powerful and predaceous creatures. They had large and complex\r\nteeth, they were protected by external bony plates, and some of them had\r\nin addition a beautiful covering of horny plates and spines, and\r\nornamental lappets. Many had well-developed ribs, indicating a condition\r\nof respiration much in advance of that in the ribless batrachians. Some\r\nof them attained to size and strength rivalling those of the modern\r\nalligators, while some of the smallest species exhibit characters\r\napproaching in some respects to the lizards.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most fish-like of these animals are those first discovered\r\nby von Dechen (_Archegosaurus_, Fig. 134). Their long heads, short\r\nnecks, supports for gills, feeble limbs and long flat tail, show that\r\nthey were aquatic creatures presenting many points of resemblance to the\r\nGanoid fishes which must have been their companions. Yet they show what\r\nno fish can exhibit, fore and hind limbs with proper toes, and the\r\ncomplete series of bones that appear in our own arms and legs, while\r\nthey must have had true lungs and breathed through nostrils. So\r\ndifferent are they from the fish in details, that a single limb bone, a\r\nvertebra, a rib, or a fragment of a skull bone, suffices to distinguish\r\nthem. Much has been said recently of the genesis of limbs; and here, as\r\nfar as now known, we have the first true limbs; but it is scarcely too\r\nmuch to say that the feet of _Archegosaurus_ differ more from the fins\r\nof any carboniferous fish than they do from the human hand; while it is\r\ncertain that the feet which made the impressions represented in Fig.\r\n133, on the lowest beds of the Carboniferous, or that from the upper\r\ncoal-formation represented in Fig. 139, were not less typical or\r\nperfectly formed feet than those of modern lizards.\r\n\r\nLeaving these fish-like forms, we find the remainder of the\r\ncarboniferous reptiles to diverge from them along three lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.aEuro\"_Archegosaurus Decheni._ Head and anterior\r\nlimb reduced. Coal-field of Saarbruck.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.aEuro\"_Ptyonius._ A Snake-like Amphibian.\r\nCoal-measures of Ohio.aEuro\"After Cope.]\r\n\r\nThe first leads to snake-like creatures, destitute of limbs, and which\r\nmust have been functionally the representatives of the serpents in the\r\nPalA|ozoic, though batrachian in their affinities (Fig. 135). They are\r\nfound both in Europe and America; and Huxley describes one from Ireland\r\nmore than twenty-one inches long, and with over one hundred\r\nvertebrA|.[57] Some extraordinary traces are found on the sandstones of\r\nthe coal-formation,[58] which appear to indicate that there may have\r\nbeen species of this type much larger than any represented by\r\nskeletons, and with bodies perhaps six inches in diameter. It is not\r\nunlikely that they had the habits of the modern water snakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136.aEuro\"A large Carboniferous Labyrinthodont\r\n(_Baphetes planiceps_, Owen).\r\n\r\n_a_, Anterior part of the skull, viewed from beneath. One-sixth natural\r\nsize, _b_, One of the largest teeth, natural size.]\r\n\r\nA second line leads upward to large crocodile-like creatures, with\r\nformidable teeth, strong bony armour, and well-developed limbs\r\n(_Labyrinthodontia_, Figs. 136, 137). Some of them must have attained a\r\nlength of ten feet. They were lizard-like in form, could walk well, as\r\nis seen from the footprints of some of the species which present a\r\nconsiderable stride, and moved over mud without the belly touching the\r\nground. Their tails were long, and probably useful in swimming. Their\r\nheads were flat and massive, and their teeth were strengthened by a\r\nremarkable folding inward of the outer plate of enamel (Fig. 137 _b_).\r\nThe belly was protected by bony plates and closely imbricated scales. In\r\nsome of the species at least the upper parts were clothed with horny\r\nscales, and the throat and sides were ornamented with pendent scaly\r\nfringes or lappets.[59] Their general aspect and mode of life must have\r\nresembled those of modern alligators; and in the vast swamps of the\r\nCoal-period, full of ponds and sluggish streams swarming with fish, they\r\nmust have found a most suitable abode. While rigid anatomy may ally\r\nthese animals rather with the batrachians than the true reptiles, it is\r\nevident that their great size, their capacity for walking with the body\r\nborne well above the ground, their bony and scaly armour, their powerful\r\nteeth and their capacious chests, with well-developed ribs, indicate\r\nconditions of respiration and general vitality quite comparable with\r\nthose of the highest modern members of the class Reptilia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137.aEuro\"_Baphetes planiceps_ (Owen).\r\n\r\n_a_, Fragment of maxillary bone showing sculpture, four outer teeth, and\r\none inner tooth.

Natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe third line of progress leads to some slender and beautiful creatures\r\n(_Microsauria_), chiefly known to us by remains found in erect trees,\r\nand which resembled in form and habits the smaller modern lizards. They\r\nhave simple teeth, a well-developed brain-case, limbs of some length,\r\nand bony and scaly armour, the latter in some cases highly ornate.[60]\r\nThey were probably the most thoroughly terrestrial, and the most active\r\nof the coal batrachians, if indeed they were not strictly intermediate\r\nbetween them and the lizards proper. Fig. 138 shows some fragments of\r\none of these animals; and the animal represented in Fig. 139, recently\r\nfigured by Fritsch, probably belongs to this group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 138.aEuro\"A lizard-like Amphibian (_Hylonomus\r\naciedentatus_).\r\n\r\n  _a_, Maxillary bone; enlarged.\r\n  _b_, Mandible; enlarged.\r\n  _c_, Teeth; magnified, showing front and side view of\r\n          ordinary tooth and grooved anterior tooth.\r\n  _d_, Section of tooth; magnified.\r\n  _e_, Scale; natural size and magnified.\r\n  _f_, Pelvic bone (?); natural size.\r\n  _g_, Rib; natural size.\r\n  _h_, Scapular bone (?); natural size.\r\n  _i_, Palate; natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.aEuro\"_Stelliosaurus longicostatus_ (Fritsch). Upper\r\nCoal-formation of Bohemia.]\r\n\r\nThe Labyrinthodonts of the Carboniferous continue upward into the\r\nPermian, where they meet with the true reptiles; and in the earlier\r\nMesozoic some of the largest and most typical examples are found.[61]\r\nBut here their reign ceases, and they give place to reptiles of more\r\nelevated type, whose history we must consider in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more remarkable than the apparently sudden and\r\nsimultaneous incoming of the batrachian reptiles in the Coal-formation.\r\nAs if at a given signal, they came up like the frogs of Egypt everywhere\r\nand in all varieties of form. If, as evolutionists suppose, they were\r\ndeveloped from fishes, this must have been by some sudden change,\r\noccurring at once all over the world, unless indeed some great and\r\nunknown gap separates the Devonian from the CarboniferousaEuro\"a supposition\r\nwhich seems quite contrary to factaEuro\"or unless in some region yet\r\nunexplored this change was proceeding, and at a particular time its\r\nproducts spread themselves over the worldaEuro\"a supposition equally\r\nimprobable. In short, the hypothesis of evolution, as applied to these\r\nanimals, is surrounded with geological improbabilities.\r\n\r\nA remarkable picture of the conditions of PalA|ozoic land life is\r\npresented by the occurrence of remains of reptiles, millepedes and\r\nland-snails in such erect trees as that represented in Fig. 140. In the\r\nnow celebrated section of the South Joggins in Nova Scotia, trees of\r\nthis kind occur at more than sixty different levels; but only in one of\r\nthese have they as yet been found to be rich in animal remains.\r\nFortunately this bed is so well exposed and so abundant in trees, that I\r\nhave myself, within a few years, removed from it about twenty of them,\r\nthe greater number affording remains of land animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140.aEuro\"Section showing the position of an erect\r\n_Sigillaria_, containing remains of land animals.\r\n\r\n  1. Underclay, with rootlets of _Stigmaria_, resting on gray shale,\r\n        with two thin coaly seams.\r\n  2.

It was a\r\n_Sigillaria_, perhaps two feet in diameter, and its stem had a dense and\r\nimperishable outer bark, a soft cellular inner bark liable to rapid\r\ndecay, and a slender woody axis not very durable. It grew on the surface\r\nof a swamp, now represented by a bed of coal. By inundations and by\r\nsubsidence, this swamp was exposed to the invasion of muddy and sandy\r\nsediment, and this went on accumulating until the stem of the tree was\r\nburied to the height of about nine feet, before which time it was no\r\ndoubt killed. After a time the top decayed and fell, leaving the buried\r\nstump imbedded in the sandy soil, which had now become dry, or nearly\r\nso. The trunk decayed, its inner bark and axis rotting away and falling\r\nin shreds into the bottom of the cylindrical hole, about nine feet deep,\r\nonce occupied by the stem, and now kept open like a shaft or well by the\r\nhard resisting outer bank. The ground around this opening became clothed\r\nwith ferns and reed-like _Calamites_, partly masking and concealing it.\r\nAnd now millepedes and land snails made the buried trunk a home, or fell\r\ninto it in their wanderings; and small reptiles sporting around, in\r\npursuit of prey, or themselves pursued, stumbled into the open pitfall,\r\nand were unable to extricate themselves, though I have found in some of\r\nthe layers in these trees trails which show that these imprisoned\r\nreptiles had wearily wandered round and round, in the vain search for\r\nmeans of exit, till they died of exhaustion and famine. The bones of\r\nthese dead reptiles, shells of land-snails and crusts of millepedes,\r\naccumulated in these natural coffins, and became mixed with vegetable\r\ndebris falling into them, and with thin layers of mud washed in by the\r\nrains; and this process continued so long that a layer of six inches to\r\na foot in thickness, full of bones, was sometimes produced. At length a\r\nnew change supervened, the area was again inundated and drifted over\r\nwith sand, and the hollow trunk was filled to the top and buried under\r\nmany feet of sediment, never to be re-opened till, after the whole had\r\nbeen hardened into sandstone and elevated to form a part of the modern\r\ncoast, when the old tree and its forest companions which had shared the\r\nsame fate with it, are made to yield up their treasures to the\r\ngeologist. This history is no fancy picture. It represents the results\r\nof long and careful study of the beds holding these erect trees, and of\r\nthe laborious extraction of great numbers of them, and the breaking-up\r\nof their contents into thin flakes, to be carefully examined with the\r\nlens under a bright light in search of the relics they contained. Fig.\r\n11 in Chap. I. represents the extraction of one of these trees, which\r\nhappened to be partially exposed by the wasting of the cliff; but many\r\nothers had to be laboriously mined out of the rock by blasting with\r\ngunpowder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140_a_.aEuro\"Section of base of erect _Sigillaria_,\r\ncontaining remains of land animals.\r\n\r\n_a_, Mineral charcoal. _b_, Dark-coloured sandstone, with plants, bones,\r\n&c. _c_, Gray sandstone, with Calamites and Cordaites.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the combination of circumstances referred to above\r\ncould not often occur; and it is therefore not wonderful that only in\r\none place and one bed has evidence of it been found, and that even in\r\nthis some of the trees have been filled up at once by sand and clay, or\r\nso crushed by falling in or lateral pressure, that they could receive no\r\nanimal remains. In one respect this is a striking evidence of the\r\nimperfection of the geological record, since, but for what may be called\r\na fortunate accident, many of the most interesting inhabitants of the\r\ncoal forests might have been altogether unknown to us. On the other\r\nhand, it shows how strange and unexpected are the ways in which the\r\nrelics of the old world have been preserved for our inspection, and that\r\nthere is probably scarcely any animal or plant that has ever lived of\r\nwhich some fragment does not exist, did we know where to look for it.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to remark, in closing this chapter, how many new forms of\r\nlife, air-breathing and otherwise, make their first appearance in the\r\nCarboniferous, and have continued to prevail until now. Here we find the\r\nfirst specimens of Amphibians, Spiders, Myriapods, Orthopterous and\r\nColeopterous Insects, and of the Crabs among ten-footed Crustaceans. In\r\nthe latter group Woodward has recently described the oldest known crab,\r\nfrom the Coal-formation of Belgium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INHABITANTS OF THE ENGLISH SEAS IN THE AGE OF REPTILES.\r\n\r\n_Pliosaurus_, _Ichthyosaurus_, _Plesiosaurus_, _Mososaurus_, and\r\n_Teleosaurus_.]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPIRE OF THE GREAT REPTILES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad we lived in the Carboniferous period, we might have supposed that\r\nthe line of the great Labyrinthodont Batrachians would have been\r\ncontinued onward and elevated, perhaps, in the direction of the\r\nMammalia, to which some features of their structure point. But we should\r\nhave been mistaken in this. The Labyrinthodonts, it is true, extend into\r\nthe Trias; but there is perhaps a sign of their coming degradation in\r\nthe appearance in the Permian of the first known mud-eel, a humble\r\nBatrachian form allied to the Newts and Water-lizards.[62] Their special\r\npeculiarities are dropped in the Mesozoic in favour of those of certain\r\nsmall and feeble lizard-like animals, appearing first in the\r\nCarboniferous, and more manifestly in the Permian, and which are the\r\ntrue forerunners, though they can scarcely be the ancestors, of the\r\nmagnificent reptilian species of the Mesozoic, which have caused this\r\nperiod to be called aEurooethe age of reptiles.aEuroŁ\r\n\r\nThe leading reptilian animal from the European Permian has long been the\r\n_Proterosaurus_, from the copper slates of Thuringia (Fig. 141), a\r\nreptile of lizard-like form, with well-developed limbs, and attaining a\r\nlength of three or four feet. It resembles more nearly those large\r\nmodern lizards known as aEurooeMonitors,aEuroŁ than any other existing form. The\r\nfore-limb represented in the figure foreshadows very closely the bones\r\nof the human arm and hand. Besides this we find in the Permian certain\r\nlizards (_Theriodonts_ of Owen) which present the remarkable and\r\nadvanced peculiarity already predicted by some Carboniferous\r\nMicrosauria,[63] of having distinct canine teeth, producing a division\r\ninto incisors, canines, and molars, in the manner of the Carnivorous\r\nquadrupeds, which they seem also to have resembled in some other parts\r\nof their skeletons. It is not impossible that the footprints in the\r\nPermian sandstones of Scotland, which have been referred to tortoises,\r\nwere those of animals of this type. Cope has recently described from the\r\nPermian of Texas a number of reptiles which have the complex dentition\r\nof the Theriodonts, and others which simulate that of Herbivorous\r\nmammals, by the possession of flat grinding teeth supposed to be adapted\r\nto vegetable food.[64] The teeth of all these Permian reptiles were set\r\nin sockets, also an advanced peculiarity. Thus already in the Permian,\r\nbefore the final decadence of the Carboniferous flora, and while the\r\nPalA|ozoic invertebrates still lingered in the sea, the age of reptiles\r\ndawned, and gave promise of its future greatness by the assumption on\r\nthe part of reptilian species of structures now limited to the Mammalia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141.aEuro\"Arm of _Proterosaurus Speneri_. Reduced.\r\nPermian.]\r\n\r\nBut the great Mesozoic reptiles were not fully enthroned, till the\r\nPermian, an unsettled and disturbed age, characterised by great earth\r\nmovements, had passed away, and until that period of continental\r\nelevation, with local deserts and desiccation, and much volcanic action,\r\nwhich we call the Trias, had also passed.\r\n\r\nThen in the Jurassic and early Cretaceous the reptiles culminated, and\r\npresented features of magnitude and structural complexity unrivalled in\r\nlater times. At the same time the Labyrinthodonts disappear, or are\r\ndegraded into the humble stations which the modern Batrachians now\r\noccupy.\r\n\r\nTo understand the reptiles of this age, it will be necessary to notice\r\nthe subdivisions of their modern representatives. The true reptiles now\r\nexisting constitute the following orders:aEuro\"1, the Turtles and Tortoises\r\n(_Chelonia_); 2, the Snakes (_Ophidia_); 3, the Lizards (_Lacertilia_);\r\n4, the Crocodiles and Alligators (_Crocodilia_). All of these, except\r\nthe snakes, are well represented among Mesozoic fossils; but we have in\r\nthis middle age of the earthaEuro(TM)s geological history to add to them from\r\nfive to seven orders now altogether extinct, and these not of low and\r\ninferior organisation, but including species far in advance of any now\r\nexisting both in elevation and magnitude, and constituting the veritable\r\naristocracy of the reptile race. It will best serve our purpose here to\r\nconsider chiefly these perished orders and their history, and then to\r\nnotice very shortly those that now survive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142.aEuro\"Skeleton of _Ichthyosaurus_. Lias. England.]\r\n\r\nThe first of the extinct orders is that of the great Sea-lizards,[65] of\r\nwhich the now familiar _Ichthyosaurus_ and _Plesiosaurus_ of the English\r\nseas, to be seen in all museums and text-books, are the types (Figs.\r\n142, 142_a_ and 142_b_). These were marine animals of large size, but\r\nnot fishes or amphibians. They were true air-breathing reptiles, but\r\nwith paddles for swimming instead of feet, and some of them with long\r\nflattened tails for steering and propulsion. They bore, in short,\r\nprecisely the same relation to the other members of the class Reptilia\r\nwhich the Whales and Porpoises bear to the ordinary quadrupeds. Some of\r\nthese animals are believed to have been fifty or sixty feet in length,\r\nthus rivalling the Whales, while others were of smaller dimensions, like\r\nthe Porpoises and Dolphins. Some, like the _Ichthyosaurus_ and\r\n_Pliosaurus_ (Fig. 142_a_), were strongly built and powerful swimmers,\r\nand able to destroy the largest fishes, while others, like\r\n_Plesiosaurus_, had the body short and compact, the head small, and the\r\nneck long and flexible, and probably preyed on small animals near the\r\nborders of the waters. Catalogues of British fossils alone include about\r\nthirty species of Enaliosaurs, which haunted the coasts of Mesozoic\r\nEurope, a wonderful fact, when we consider the absence of these\r\ncreatures from the modern seas, and the probability that only a fraction\r\nof the species are yet known to us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142_a_.aEuro\"Head of _Pliosaurus_. Jurassic. Much\r\nreduced.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142_b_.aEuro\"Paddle of _Plesiosaurus Oxoniensis_.\r\nJurassic.aEuro\"After Phillips. One-tenth natural size.]\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable group is that to which Cope has given the name of\r\n_Pythonomorpha_, and which he regards as allied to the serpents, or as\r\ngigantic sea-serpents provided with swimming paddles, but which Owen\r\nconsiders more nearly connected with the lizards. In either case they\r\nconstitute a group by themselves, remarkable not only on account of\r\ntheir anatomical affinities with animals so unlike them in general port,\r\nbut also for their enormously extended length and formidable dentition\r\n(Fig. 143). Such animals as the _Mososaurus_ of Maestricht and\r\n_Clidastes_ of Western America may have exceeded in length the largest\r\nIchthyosaurs and the most bulky of living Cetaceans, though their\r\nslender forms and numerous vertebrA| remind one of the semi-fabulous\r\nsea-serpent, rather than of any known animal of our modern age. They\r\nwere characteristic of the Later Mesozoic, more especially of the\r\nCretaceous period, and must have been formidable enemies to the fishes\r\nof their time.\r\n\r\nOwen has formed two orders[66] for the reception of some remarkable\r\nextinct reptiles of this age, found especially in South Africa and\r\nIndia, but also in Europe and America. The first includes large\r\nlizard-like animals having horny jaws like those of turtles, and in some\r\nof the species with great defensive tusks (Fig. 144). Their mode of life\r\nis not well known, but they may have been peaceable and harmless\r\nvegetable feeders. The second has been already referred to, in\r\nconnection with the Permian, where it first appears, though it is\r\ncontinued in the Trias (Fig. 145). The resemblance of the skulls of\r\nthese creatures to those of Carnivorous mammals is very striking, and\r\nnothing can be more singular than their early appearance and their\r\ndecadence before the advent of those Tertiary mammals which in more\r\nmodern times occupy their place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 143.aEuro\"Skeleton of _Clidastes_.

Natural size.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most extraordinary of all the Mesozoic modifications of the\r\nreptilian type was that of the flying reptiles, or _Pterodactyls_.\r\nThese were, in short, lizards modified for flight, somewhat in the same\r\nmanner with the bats among the mammals. If the bat may be likened to a\r\nflying shrew-mouse, a Pterodactyl may in like manner be compared to a\r\nflying lizard; but the modification in the latter case is by much the\r\nmore remarkable, inasmuch as the lizard is a cold-blooded animal, and\r\nfar less likely to be endowed with the active circulation and muscular\r\npower necessary to flight than is the mouse. In point of fact, there can\r\nbe no doubt that the Pterodactyls must have been provided with some\r\napproach to a mammalian or ornithic heart, as they certainly were with\r\ngreat breast-muscles attached to a keel in the breast-bone for working\r\ntheir large membranous wings. These wings were also somewhat original in\r\ntheir construction. They were not furnished with pinions, like those of\r\nthe bird, but with a membrane like that of the bat, and this, instead of\r\nbeing stretched over four enormously lengthened fingers, as in that\r\nquadruped, was supported on a single elongated finger, corresponding,\r\nsingularly enough, to the little finger, which usually inconspicuous\r\nmember constituted in some of these strange creatures a limb longer than\r\nthe whole body (Figs. 146, 147.) The other fingers of the hand were left\r\nfree for walking or grasping. They are thus believed to have been able\r\nto walk as well as to fly, and even in case of need, to swim; while\r\nthey could probably perch like birds on rocks and trees. Their heads,\r\nthough very lightly framed, were large and reptilian in aspect, and\r\nfurnished with sharp teeth, and sometimes probably with a beak as well.\r\nFew creatures of the old world are of more hideous and sinister aspect.\r\nYet some of them must have been as light and graceful on the wing as\r\nswallows or sea-gulls. There are many species, most of them small, but\r\nsome of those in the later Mesozoic attained to so great a size that the\r\nexpanse of their wings must have exceeded twenty feet, making them\r\nveritable flying dragons, probably formidable to all the smaller animals\r\nof their time. Though these animals were strictly reptiles, they\r\ncombined in their structures contrivances for aA\"rial locomotion now\r\ndistributed between the bats and the birds. They had bat-like wings and\r\nbird-like chests. Some had horny beaks. All had hollow limb bones, and\r\nair cavities to give lightness to the skull. Their brains approach to\r\nthose of birds, and, as already stated, their respiration and\r\ncirculation must have been of a high order. These facts are very\r\nsuggestive, and perhaps in no point is the imagination or the faith of\r\nthe devout evolutionist more severely tested than in realising the\r\nspontaneous assumption of these characters by reptiles, and their\r\nsubsequent distribution between the very dissimilar types in which they\r\nare now continued.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 148.aEuro\"A Jurassic Bird (_ArchA|opteryx\r\nmacroura_).aEuro\"After Owen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 149.aEuro\"Jaw of a Cretaceous Toothed Bird (_Ichthyornis\r\ndispar_).aEuro\"After Marsh. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe approximation of the winged reptiles to the birds is further\r\nincreased by the facts that in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods there\r\nwere birds having reptilian tails and probably toothed jaws\r\n(_ArchA|opteryx macroura_, Fig. 148). The species just named, while in\r\nits limbs, trunk, and feathers a veritable perching bird, resembles a\r\nreptile in its head and tail. In the Cretaceous of Western America,\r\nMarsh has recently discovered two distinct types of toothed birds, one\r\nhaving the teeth in regular sockets, the other having them implanted in\r\na groove in the jaw. One of these birds (_Ichthyornis dispar_, Fig. 149)\r\nwas larger than a pigeon, with powerful wings constructed like those of\r\nordinary birds. It had also the curious and old-fashioned peculiarity of\r\nbiconcave vertebrA|, like those of fishes and some reptiles. Another\r\n(_Hesperornis regalis_) stood five or six feet high, and had rudimentary\r\nwings like those of the Penguins. These toothed birds extend into the\r\nEocene Tertiary, where the _Odontopteryx_ of Owen has been known for\r\nsome time. In the Eocene, however, this toothed bird is associated with\r\nothers of ordinary types, allied closely to the Ostriches, the Pelicans,\r\nthe Ibis, the Woodpeckers, the Hawks, the Owls, the Vultures, and the\r\nordinary perching birds. In the Later Mesozoic, indeed, some reptiles\r\nbecame so bird-like that they nearly approached the earliest birds; but\r\nthis was a final and futile effort of the reptile to obtain in the air\r\nthat supremacy which it had long enjoyed in earth and water; and its\r\nfailure was immediately succeeded in the Eocene by the appearance of a\r\ncloud of true birds, representing all the existing orders of the class.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 150.aEuro\"Jaw of _Bathygnathus borealis_ (Leidy). A\r\nTriassic Dinosaur from Prince Edward Island.\r\n\r\n_a_, Cross section of second tooth, natural size. _b_, Fifth tooth,\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\nWe may close our notice of the winged reptiles of the Mesozoic by\r\nquoting from Phillips his summary of the characters of _Rhamphorhyncus_\r\n(Fig. 147)[67]: aEurooeGifted with ample means of flight, able at least to\r\nperch on rocks and scuffle along the shore, perhaps competent to dive,\r\nthough not so well as a palmiped bird, many fishes must have yielded to\r\nthe cruel beak and sharp teeth of the _Rhamphorhyncus_. If we ask to which\r\nof the many families of birds the analogy of structure and probable way\r\nof life would lead us to assimilate _Rhamphorhyncus_, the answer must\r\npoint to the swimming races, with long wings, clawed feet, hooked beak,\r\nand habits of violence and voracity; and for preference, the shortness\r\nof the legs and other circumstances may be held to claim for the\r\nStonesfield fossil a more than fanciful similitude to the groups of\r\nCormorants and other marine divers which constitute an effective part of\r\nthe picturesque army of robbers of the sea.aEuroŁ\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151.aEuro\"_Hadrosaurus Foulkii_ (Cope). An Herbivorous\r\nDinosaur, 28 feet long.aEuro\"After HawkinsaEuro(TM)s restoration.]\r\n\r\nLastly, the reptiles, in this age of their imperial sway, culminated in\r\nthe _Dinosaurians_, animals far above any modern Reptilia in the\r\nperfection of their organisation, and many of them of gigantic size.\r\nJust as the Pterosaurs filled the place now occupied by the birds, so\r\nthe Dinosaurs filled that represented by the mammals, or rather they\r\ntook up a place holding some close relations with both the birds and the\r\nmammals. There were thus reptilian animals which on the one hand were\r\nthe elephants and lions of their time, and on the other bore a grotesque\r\nresemblance to creatures so unlike these as the Ostriches, in so far as\r\ntheir anatomical structure was concerned; while it is evident that their\r\nwhole organisation places them in the highest position possible within\r\nthe reptilian class. Some of them must have been herbivorous, and\r\nprobably slow in movement and quiet in nature. Others were carnivorous\r\nand of terrible energy, while furnished with the most destructive\r\nweapons (Figs. 152, 153). Many had the power of erecting themselves on\r\ntheir hind-feet and walking as bipeds; and to adapt them to this end\r\ntheir hinder limbs were very large and strong, and they had long\r\npillar-like tails, while their fore-feet were comparatively small, and\r\nused perhaps mainly for prehension (Figs. 151, 154).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 152.aEuro\"Jaws of _Megalosaurus_.aEuro\"After Phillips.\r\nOne-tenth natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe size of some of these creatures was stupendous. The _Hadrosaurus_ of\r\nNew Jersey, an Herbivorous species (Fig. 151), when erected on its hind\r\nlimbs and tail, must have stood more than twenty feet in height.\r\n_Megalosaurus_ and _Iguanodon_, of the English Jurassic and Wealden,\r\nmust have been of still more gigantic size. The former was a carnivorous\r\nanimal, its head (Fig. 152) four or five feet in length, armed with\r\nteeth, sabre-shaped, sharp and crenate on the edges (Fig. 153), its hind\r\nlimbs of enormous power, so that if our imagination does not fail us in\r\nthe attempt to realise such a wonder, we may even suppose this huge\r\nanimal, much larger than the largest elephant, springing like a tiger on\r\nits prey, a miracle of terrible strength and ferocity, before which no\r\nliving thing could stand. Its companion, _Iguanodon_, was, on the\r\ncontrary, a harmless herbivorous creature, using its great strength and\r\nstature as a means of obtaining leaves and fruits for food, and perhaps\r\nfalling a prey to the larger Carnivorous Dinosaurs its contemporaries. A\r\nstill more bulky animal was the _Ceteosaurus_, so admirably described by\r\nPhillips. Its thigh-bone measures more than five feet in length and a\r\nfoot in diameter; and it must have stood ten feet high when on all\r\nfours, while its length must have reached forty or fifty feet. It seems\r\nfrom the forms of its bones to have been able to walk on land, but\r\nprobably spent most of its time in the water, where it may be compared\r\nto a huge reptilian hippopotamus. Very recently some bones found in\r\nrocks, possibly of Wealden age, in Western America, and described by\r\nCope and by Marsh, indicate that even _Ceteosaurus_ had not attained to\r\nthe maximum of Dinosaurian dimensions. These new animals have vertebrA|\r\ntwenty inches in length and from twelve inches to thirteen inches in the\r\ndiameter of their bodies, while their lateral processes stretched three\r\nand a half feet. The shoulder-blade of one species is five feet in\r\nlength, and its thigh-bone is six feet long. From these measurements\r\nCope concludes that, unlike most other Dinosaurs, it had the fore-feet\r\nlarger in proportion than the hind-feet, so as to have somewhat the\r\nappearance of a large giraffe. The bones of the back have a remarkable\r\ncavernous structure, which Cope interprets as indicating air cavities,\r\nto give lightness, as in the case of the bones of birds; but Owen\r\nsuggests that the cavities were filled with cartilage, and that the\r\nanimals were aquatic in their habits. Evidently in point of size the\r\nDinosaurs had a better claim than even Behemoth to be called the aEurooechief\r\nof the ways of God.aEuroŁ Some of them, however, were of small size, and\r\nprobably active and bird-like in their movements. One of these is the\r\nanimal represented in Fig. 154, a species from the lithographic\r\nlimestone of Solenhofen.[68]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153.aEuro\"Tooth of _Megalosaurus_. Natural size.\r\n\r\n_a_, Cross section. _b_, Crenellation of edges. Enlarged.]\r\n\r\nNothing in the life of the Mesozoic has so seized on the imagination of\r\nevolutionists as the links of connection between birds and reptiles,\r\nwhich has even been introduced by Huxley into the classification of\r\nanimals, by his grouping these heretofore very distinct classes in one\r\ngigantic and comprehensive class of _Sauropsida_. It is necessary,\r\ntherefore, to glance at these connections, and if possible to arrive at\r\nsome conception of their true value. The links which connect the\r\nreptiles and the birds are twofold. First, that between the Dinosaurs\r\nand the ostrich tribe,[69] and, secondly, that between the Pterodactyls\r\nand their allies, and the peculiar Mesozoic birds, such as\r\n_ArchA|opteryx_. The first would serve to account for the few exceptional\r\nStruthious birds of the modern world. The second would account for the\r\nPasserine and other more ordinary birds; and thus, according to\r\nevolution, the now somewhat homogeneous class of birds would have a\r\ndouble, or more probably multiple, origin from several lines of\r\nreptilian ancestors. This, no doubt, greatly complicates the links of\r\nconnection, whether these be supposed to indicate derivation or not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154.aEuro\"_Compsognathus._ One of the smaller\r\nDinosaurs.aEuro\"After Wagner.]\r\n\r\nIf we inquire as to the first connection above stated, we may define it\r\nbriefly in the words of Prof. Phillips, with reference to\r\n_Megalosaurus_, which aEurooewas not a ground-crawler, like the alligator, but\r\nmoving with free steps, chiefly, if not solely, on the hind limbs, and\r\nclaiming a curious analogy, if not some degree of affinity, with the\r\nostrich.aEuroŁ[70] But the question arises, Was this resemblance merely that\r\nof two oviparous bipeds, or anything more? and when we set off, against\r\nthe resemblance in haunch bones and hind limbs, the entire dissimilarity\r\nin head, in fore limbs, in vertebrA|, in tail, and probably in external\r\ncovering, we are disposed to agree with Huxley in his statement, with\r\nrespect to the Struthious birds, that their aEurooetotal amount of\r\napproximation to the reptilian type is but small; and the gap between\r\nreptiles and birds is but very slightly narrowed by their existence.aEuroŁ\r\nThere is therefore here a great gap, even in the linking together of the\r\ntypes, independently of any question of derivation.\r\n\r\nThe second line of connection appears at first sight more promising.\r\n_ArchA|opteryx_ has a reptilian tail, and claws on the wing; and, as it had\r\ntoothed jaws, like some of the birds in the Cretaceous, must have\r\naltogether made a much nearer approach to a reptile than any modern bird\r\ndoes. The remarkable aEurooefish-birdaEuroŁ (_Ichthyornis_) of Marsh is also very\r\nreptilian in some of its characters. But when we compare these reptilian\r\nbirds with the Pterodactyls and their allies, a vast gap at once becomes\r\napparent. Disregarding the external clothing, we find the wing in the\r\ntwo groups entirely dissimilar in details of construction, and this\r\ndissimilarity extends to the hind limbs as well, so that the\r\nPterodactyls resemble bats rather than birds.\r\n\r\nWithout committing ourselves to any doctrine of development, we might\r\nhave rejoiced if our geological discoveries had established a continuous\r\nchain, or two continuous chains, of being between the reptiles and the\r\nbirds; but this end is evidently still far from being attained, though\r\nsome approximation has undoubtedly been made. To quote again the\r\nadmission of Huxley: aEurooeBirds are no more modified reptiles than reptiles\r\nare modified birds, the reptilian and ornithic types being both in\r\nreality somewhat different superstructures, raised upon one and the same\r\nground-planaEuroŁaEuro\"that ground-plan being the idea of the air-breathing\r\noviparous vertebrate, and the reptile representing the less specialized\r\nand less ornate building. As yet the origin of that idea, and the mode\r\nof carrying it out to completion, remain unknown, except to the\r\nArchitect and Builder, who may reveal them to earnest seekers for truth\r\nin His own good time.\r\n\r\nAs to links of connection with the Mammalia, these are still more\r\nobscure. In the Mesozoic the mammals are represented as yet only by a\r\nfew small species allied to the pouched (Marsupial) and insectivorous\r\nquadrupeds of Australia, and these are closely linked with some of the\r\nsmaller carnivorous Mammalia of the early Tertiary; but neither approach\r\nvery closely to any known reptilian types. Nor have we yet any\r\nconnecting links between the great marine reptiles and the Cetaceans and\r\nSirenians which in the Tertiary take their place in the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact, to come before us in our next chapter, that\r\nthe great land reptiles of the Mesozoic survived long enough to become\r\ncontemporary with the introduction and first luxuriance of the modern\r\ntypes of vegetation in the later Cretaceous. It would be natural to\r\nsuppose that access to these great supplies of better food would have\r\nstimulated the increase and development of the herbivorous species, and\r\nwould have indirectly had the same effect on those that were\r\ncarnivorous; but the opposite result seems to have followed, and in the\r\nnext period the reptiles altogether gave place to the mammals, unless,\r\nindeed, they were themselves by some mysterious and comparatively rapid\r\nprocess transformed into Mammalia, to suit them to the better conditions\r\nof an improved world.\r\n\r\nSo far as yet known, the reign of reptiles was world-wide in its time;\r\nand the imagination is taxed to conceive of a state of things in which\r\nthe seas swarmed with great reptiles on every coast, when the land was\r\ntrodden by colossal reptilian bipeds and quadrupeds, in comparison with\r\nsome of which our elephants are pygmies, and when the air was filled\r\nwith the grotesque and formidable Pterodactyls. Yet this is no fancy\r\npicture. It represents a time which actually existed, when that\r\ncomparatively low, brutal, and insensate type of existence represented\r\nby the modern crocodiles and alligators was supreme in the world. The\r\nduration of these creatures was long, and in watching the progress of\r\ncreation, they would have seemed the permanent inhabitants of the earth.\r\nYet all have perished, and their modern successors, except a few large\r\nspecies existing in the warmer climates, have become subject to the more\r\nrecently introduced Mammalia.\r\n\r\nHow did the ancient reptile aristocracy perish? We are ignorant of the\r\ndetails of the catastrophe, but their final disappearance and\r\nreplacement by the more modern fauna was connected with a great\r\ncontinental subsidence in the Cretaceous age, and with changes of\r\nclimate and conditions preceding and subsequent to it. Yet the struggle\r\nfor continued dominion was hard and protracted; and toward its close\r\nsome of the champions of the reign of reptiles were the greatest and\r\nmost magnificent examples of the type; as if they had risen in their\r\nmight to defy approaching ruin. Thus some of the most stupendous forms\r\nappear in the later Cretaceous, after the great subsidence had made\r\nprogress and almost attained its consummation. Like the antediluvian\r\ngiants, they were undismayed even when the land began to sink beneath\r\ntheir feet; and for them there was no ark of deliverance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOWER CRETACEOUS LEAVES.

Oceanic\r\ndeposits, like the Upper Chalk, are succeeded by beds of littoral and\r\nestuarine characters. The last and some of the greatest of the Mesozoic\r\nSaurians have their burial-places in the Upper Cretaceous, and appear no\r\nmore on earth. The wonderful shell-fishes of the Ammonite group, and the\r\ncuttle-fishes of the Belemnite type, share the same fate. With the\r\nearliest deposits of the Eocene Tertiary came in multitudes of large\r\nMammalia heretofore unknown, and the Cetaceans appear in the sea instead\r\nof the great marine lizards; while shells, corals, and crustaceans of\r\nmodern types swarm in the waters. Thus it is true that a great and\r\napparently somewhat abrupt change takes place at the close of the\r\nCretaceous, and terminates for ever the reptilian age. Even in regions\r\nlike Western America, where physically the later Cretaceous shades\r\ngradually into the earlier Tertiary, so that there have been doubts as\r\nto the limits of these several periods, the same great change in animal\r\nlife occurs.\r\n\r\nBut a link of connection has at length been found in the history of the\r\nvegetable kingdom. The modern flora came in with its full force in the\r\nlater Cretaceous, before the end of the reptilian age, and continued\r\nonward to the present time. Thus the plant takes precedence of the\r\nanimal, and the preparation was made for the mammalian life of the\r\nEocene by the introduction of the modern flora in the Cretaceous period.\r\nIn like manner it is possible that the great graphite deposits of the\r\nLaurentian indicate a vegetation which preceded the swarming marine life\r\nof the Cambrian; and it is not improbable that the PalA|ozoic land flora\r\nexisted long before the first land animals. Thus the plant, as in the\r\nold Mosaic record, ever appears on the day before the animal, in each\r\nstage of the development of the world.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter IV. we traced the history of the old and rich vegetation of\r\nthe Coal period. But this vegetation consisted principally of cryptogams\r\nand those lowest phA|nogams, of the pine and cycad groups, which have\r\nnaked seeds. In the modern flora we may arrange the several groups of\r\nplants, somewhat naturally, as follows:aEuro\"\r\n\r\n_Series I._, CRYPTOGAMS:aEuro\"\r\n\r\n  Class 1, _Thallophytes_, sea-weeds, lichens, fungi.\r\n    aEuroŁ   2, _Anophytes_, mosses, &c.\r\n    aEuroŁ   3, _Acrogens_, ferns, lycopods, horsetails.\r\n\r\n_Series II._, PHAćNOGAMS:aEuro\"\r\n\r\n  Class 4, _Gymnosperms_, pines, cycads, &c.\r\n    aEuroŁ   5, _Endogens_, palms, grasses, &c.\r\n    aEuroŁ   6, _Exogens_, oaks, maples, &c.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the history of these groups the record stands as\r\nfollows:aEuro\"In the PalA|ozoic age classes 3 and 4 culminated, and\r\nconstituted the great mass of the arboreal vegetation. On entering the\r\nMesozoic, No. 3 becomes somewhat diminished, but No. 4 continues with\r\nunabated prevalence, so that the Mesozoic has sometimes been\r\ncharacterized as emphatically the age of Gymnosperms. With these appear\r\nsome Endogens, allied to the modern Yuccas and Screw pines and Arums.\r\nBut in the lower Mesozoic rocks we have no representatives of the\r\nbroad-leaved Exogens (Angiosperms), which constitute the great mass of\r\nordinary forest vegetation; and it is only in the Cretaceous that we\r\nfind them appearing in force, and that the monotonous vegetation of the\r\nolder style was replaced by the more beautiful and varied forms of our\r\nmodern woods.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, in the lower part of the Upper Cretaceous of Bohemia\r\n(_Cenomanian_), have been found some leaves which indicate the beginning\r\nof this change. These have been referred to CA|salpinias or Brasilettos,\r\npod-bearing trees of India and tropical America, _Aralias_ or Ginsengs,\r\n_Magnolias_, Laurels, an Ivy, and a peculiar and uncertain genus\r\n(_Credneria_). With these are noble palms, both of the types with\r\npinnate and palmate leaves, and trees allied to the Giant _Sequoias_ of\r\nCalifornia, and to the Araucarian pines of the southern hemisphere. (See\r\nFrontispiece to this Chapter.) These ancient Cretaceous forests of\r\nEastern Europe are compared by Saporta with those which now live in the\r\nwarmer portions of China or in South AmericaaEuro\"truly a marvellous change\r\nfrom the sombre and uniform vegetation by which they seem to have been\r\nimmediately preceded. A still further development of modern vegetation\r\ntakes place in the next or highest member of the Cretaceous, the\r\nMaestricht beds (_Senonian_), where we find a crowd of modern types. On\r\nthis great change Count Saporta remarks with truth that there seem to\r\nhave been periods of pause and of activity in the introduction of\r\nplants. The Jurassic period was one of inactivity; and a new and\r\nvigorous evolution, as he regards it, is introduced in the middle of the\r\nCretaceous.\r\n\r\nThis new and grand elevation of the vegetable kingdom in the Cretaceous\r\nage was not local merely. In Moravia, in the Hartz, in Belgium and\r\nFrance, even in Greenland, the same great renewing of the face of the\r\nearth was in progress. In America it was proceeding on a grand scale,\r\nand seems to have set in earlier than in Europe.[71] In the Dakota group\r\nof the West, one of the lower members of the Cretaceous, and covering a\r\nvast area, a rich angiospermous flora has been discovered by Hayden, and\r\ndescribed by Lesquereux and Newberry, and beds of coal have been formed\r\nfrom its remains. In VancouveraEuro(TM)s Island in British Columbia, Cretaceous\r\ncoal measures occur, comparable in value and in the excellence of the\r\nfuel they afford with those of the true coal formation. Some of the beds\r\nof coal are eight feet in thickness, and the shales associated with them\r\nabound in leaves of exogenous trees generally similar to those still\r\nliving in America. In these beds are also found mineralized trunks,\r\nwhich present under the microscope the familiar structures of our oaks,\r\nbirches, and other modern trees. Thus all over the northern hemisphere\r\nthe elevation of the land out of the waters of the great Cretaceous\r\nsubsidence was signalized by a development of noble and exuberant forest\r\nvegetation, of the types still extant. The following list of families\r\nfound in the Cretaceous, after Saporta, will show the botanist how fully\r\nour modern Exogens are represented:aEuro\"\r\n\r\n  APETALAć.\r\n  _MyricaceA|._\r\n  _CupuliferA|._\r\n  _BetulaceA|._\r\n  _SalicaceA|._\r\n  _MoreA|._\r\n  _ProteaceA|._\r\n  _LauraceA|._\r\n\r\n  GAMOPETALAć.\r\n  _ApocynaceA|._\r\n  _EricaceA|._\r\n  _EbenaceA|._\r\n  _MyrsineA|._\r\n\r\n  POLYPETALAć.\r\n  _AraliaceA|._\r\n  _HamameliaceA|._\r\n  _HelleborineA|._\r\n  _MagnoliaceA|._\r\n  _TiliaceA|._\r\n  _CelastraceA|._\r\n  _AnacardiaceA|._\r\n  _MyrtaceA|._\r\n\r\nOf the plants in this list, some, like the oaks, birches, willows, and\r\nheaths, are common and familiar members of the flora of the northern\r\nhemisphere to-day, and even of the European flora. Some, like the\r\n_Magnolias_, _Myricas_, and witch-hazels, are characteristically American,\r\nand a few, like the ProteaceA|, are now confined to the southern\r\nhemisphere. Some of these families have dwindled since the Cretaceous\r\ntime, so as to be represented by very few species, or at least have not\r\nadvanced, while others have multiplied and prospered; and on the whole\r\nthe flora of the northern hemisphere seems to have been as rich in this\r\nearly beginning of our modern forests as it is at the present day.\r\nLesquereuxaEuro(TM)s results, with reference to the American flora of the Dakota\r\ngroup, are very similar, and present some surprising features of\r\nresemblance to modern American forests, though he remarks that these\r\nCretaceous trees are generally characterized by the even or unserrated\r\nedges of their leaves; and the same remark seems to apply to the oldest\r\nCretaceous leaves of Europe.\r\n\r\nA very singular feature of the Cretaceous flora is the number of species\r\nof some genera now represented by few or even a single species; and this\r\nis the more remarkable when we consider how few species, comparatively,\r\nof the older flora, are known to us. For example, Lesquereux, though\r\naware of the great variability of the modern _Sassafras_ of America,\r\nrecognizes eight species of this genus in the Dakota Cretaceous, one of\r\nwhich seems to be that still living in America, so that it has continued\r\nunchanged, while the others have perished (Fig. 155). Thus this genus\r\nculminates at once in the Cretaceous, but continues still in one of its\r\nspecies. Again, the tulip-tree, _Liriodendron_, one of the most\r\nbeautiful, unique, and invariable of American trees, is represented by\r\none sole species in the present world. There seem to be no less than\r\nfour in the Dakota beds, besides others in the Cretaceous of New Jersey,\r\nand one species is found in the Tertiary of Greenland as well as in that\r\nof Europe (Fig. 156). There are probably four or five species of\r\nplane-tree (_Platanus_) now extant, of which but one occurs in America,\r\nunless _P. Mexicana_, the Mexican plane-tree, is a good species as\r\ndistinct from the ordinary, more northern, form. There are seven\r\nspecies, according to Lesquereux, in the Cretaceous of Dakota alone.\r\nThis sort of evolution backward, or from many species to few, would\r\nprobably be greatly increased, had we fuller knowledge of the Cretaceous\r\nflora, as there are several genera already represented by as many\r\nspecies as they can boast in modern times. We have already seen that\r\nthis abrupt and sudden culmination of genera and families, and their\r\nsubsequent decadence, is no rare thing in geology, and it connects\r\nitself with that idea of periods of creative activity which we have\r\nalready had occasion to notice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155.aEuro\"_Sassafras cretaceum_ (Newberry).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 156.aEuro\"_Liriodendron primA|vum_ (Newberry).

These are, however, of modern types; and\r\nit is remarkable that some of them appear to have continued without even\r\nspecific change from the later Cretaceous up to the present time. A\r\nstriking illustration of this is afforded by two ferns discovered side\r\nby side in the oldest Eocene beds[72] of the plains west of Red River,\r\nand described in Dr. G. M. DawsonaEuro(TM)s report on the 49th parallel. One of\r\nthese is the well-known and very common _Onoclea sensibilis_ (Fig. 157),\r\nor sensitive fern of Eastern America.[73] This species came into\r\nexistence at latest at the close of the Cretaceous, and has apparently\r\nbeen continued in America up to the present time. In Europe, where it\r\ndoes not now live, it occurs as a fossil in Eocene beds in the Isle of\r\nMull. The other is _Davallia tenuifolia_ (Fig. 158), a delicate little\r\nplant belonging to a genus not now represented in America, and to a\r\nspecies at present found only in Asia. Yet this species also lived in\r\nAmerica in early Eocene times, but has since been banished, though its\r\nformer companion, the _Onoclea_, still holds its ground. Such cases of\r\nspecific persistence along with great changes of habitat are very\r\ninstructive as to the permanence of species.\r\n\r\nCount Saporta, whose just remarks on the marvellously sudden incoming of\r\nthe Cretaceous flora we have already referred to, also notices the fact\r\nthat the families and genera represented in this flora are a most\r\nmiscellaneous and unconnected assemblage, showing either the\r\nsimultaneous appearance of many dissimilar types, or requiring us to\r\nbelieve in the existence of these and of intermediate forms for a very\r\nlong period before that in which they are first found. This may,\r\nhowever, be placed in connection with the appearance of an exogenous\r\ntree (_Syringoxylon_) in the Devonian, referred to in a previous\r\nchapter. It would be a strange and now little suspected case of\r\nimperfection of the record, if it should be found that trees of this\r\ntype were lurking in exceptional corners through all the vast periods\r\nbetween the Devonian and the Cretaceous, to burst forth in unwonted\r\nvariety and luxuriance in the latter period.\r\n\r\nThe new Cretaceous flora appears first in beds which had been recently\r\nelevated from the ocean of the great Cretaceous subsidence; and when it\r\nfirst flourished, in temperate regions at least, the continents were of\r\nsmall dimensions, and broken up into groups of islands. Farther, America\r\nwould seem to have had precedence of the Eastern Continent, and the\r\nArctic of the Temperate regions. Thus on the elevation of the later\r\nCretaceous land, plants previously established in the far north spread\r\nthemselves southward, over newly-raised lands, radiating from the polar\r\nregions into Europe, Asia, and America. This seems the only way of\r\naccounting for the similarity of the plants in these distant countries.\r\nThe new flora of the Upper Cretaceous in its journey southward met with\r\na climate probably warmer than the present, yet not so warm as to\r\nprevent trees similar to those now living in the same latitudes from\r\nflourishing.\r\n\r\nLet us now trace this flora through the succeeding ages, in which I\r\nshall follow pretty closely some general statements made by Count De\r\nSaporta in memoirs recently published.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 159.aEuro\"Eocene Leaves. From Aix.\r\n\r\n_a_, _Quercus antecedens_ (Saporta). _b_, _Diospyros pyrifolia_\r\n(Saporta). _c_, _Myrica Mathesonii_ (Saporta).]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Eocene we find a humid and warm climate in\r\nEurope, with great forests of oaks, chestnuts, laurels, giant pines, and\r\nother genera, some of them still European, others Asiatic or American,\r\nand many of them survivors of the Cretaceous (Figs. 159 to 162); and at\r\nthe same period similar forests overspread those great plains of North\r\nAmerica which were rising from out the Cretaceous sea, and there vast\r\nswampy beds were formed of vegetable _dA(C)bris_, giving origin to beds of\r\nbrown coal, some of them eighteen feet in thickness. Then came in Europe\r\nand Asia that great subsidence under the sea, during which the Nummuline\r\nlimestones were deposited, and when the old continent was resolved again\r\ninto an archipelago of islands, perhaps closely connected with more\r\nsouthern lands. This led to a great increase of southern forms of\r\nplants, which does not seem to have occurred to the same extent in\r\nAmerica, where the flora is more continuous, though showing a warmer\r\nclimate in the older than in the newer Eocene. At this period Palms,\r\nScrew pines, Proteaceous shrubs, Myrtles, _Acacias_, and other plants of\r\nthe character of those of more southern climates were dominant in Europe\r\n(Fig. 163). The well-known beds of Bournemouth, in the south of\r\nEngland,[74] contain a rich flora of the Eocene age, perhaps of its\r\nmiddle period, and reminding us of the forests of sub-tropical India or\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 160.aEuro\"An Ancient Clover (_Trifolium palA|ogA|um_,\r\nSaporta).

But in the middle of the Eocene another subsidence\r\noccurred, which exterminated much of the Eocene flora, and was perhaps\r\naccompanied with a reduction of temperature, in which the more northern\r\nlands became covered with great forests of trees allied to the Pines. In\r\nEngland a remarkable deposit of this age is that of Bovey Tracey, in\r\nDevonshire, where beds of clay and brown coal have afforded a rich flora\r\nof American and southern types. The _Sequoia_ shown in Fig. 164 abounds\r\nat this place, and is a near relation to the celebrated aEurooebig treesaEuroŁ of\r\nCalifornia; the _Cinnamomum_ in Fig. 165 is a type equally foreign from\r\nmodern England. It is a curious feature of the Bovey deposit that\r\nimmediately above these Eocene beds, holding a rich flora of warm\r\ntemperate character, are glacial clays with leaves of Arctic willows and\r\nof the dwarf birch, indicating a climate much more severe than that of\r\nthe British Islands at present.[75]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 164.aEuro\"Branch and Fruit of _Sequoia CouttsiA|_ (Heer).\r\nEocene. England.]\r\n\r\nIn the Miocene period the land again rose, and the northern flora spread\r\nitself southward equally over Europe, Asia, and America, so that the\r\nMiocene flora of all these regions is very similar; and this Miocene\r\nflora continues substantially to this day in Eastern America and Eastern\r\nAsia, except that it has been greatly reduced in number of species by\r\nthe intervention of the cold glacial period; but in Europe and Western\r\nAmerica it has been largely replaced by other apparently more modern\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 165.aEuro\"_Cinnamomum Scheuchzeri_ (Heer). Eocene.\r\nEngland.]\r\n\r\nA striking result of recent discoveries is the fact that in Cretaceous\r\nand Eocene times a very warm climate prevailed in the extreme Arctic\r\nregions, and trees of temperate latitudes grew there freely. In the\r\nrecent Arctic expedition, Captain Fielden found in latitude 81A deg. 40aEuro(TM),\r\nwithin 600 miles of the Pole, a bed of lignite, from twenty-five to\r\nthirty feet in thickness, associated with remains of plants such as now\r\ngrow only in temperate latitudes.\r\n\r\naEurooeFrom the character of the plant-remains, Dr. Heer infers that the\r\nlignite of this locality represents an ancient peat-moss, which must\r\nhave been of wide extent, with reeds, sedges, birches, poplar, and\r\ncertain conifers growing on its banks; while the higher and drier ground\r\nin the neighbourhood probably supported a growth of pines and firs, with\r\nelms and hazel-bushes. The remains of water-lilies suggest the existence\r\nof a fresh-water lake in the old peat-moss, which must have remained\r\nunfrozen during a great part of the year.aEuroŁ\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed with reference to the age of these beds, that as\r\nthe Later Cretaceous and Eocene flora of Europe and America migrated\r\nfrom the north, the plants found in the beds of that age in the\r\ntemperate latitudes may really be somewhat older in the Arctic regions,\r\na fact which produces some uncertainty as to their actual age.\r\n\r\nThe warmth required for the growth of luxuriant forests near the Pole\r\nmight be secured by a different distribution of land and water, and of\r\nthe oceanic currents, but the requirements of plants as to light seem\r\nmore difficult to meet, and it has been doubted whether species similar\r\nto those which are accustomed in modern times to regular alternations of\r\nday and night could submit to the long Arctic winter darkness. It is\r\nknown, however, that in conservatories in Northern Russia plants\r\nsupplied with heat and moisture can endure in winter great deprivation\r\nof light, and at Disco, in Greenland, roses and fuchsias flourish as\r\nhouse plants.[76] These facts show that if there were sufficient light\r\nand heat in summer, a great number of the plants of temperate latitudes\r\ncould endure extreme cold and much deprivation of light in winter.\r\n\r\nIt may be well here to inform the reader that some confusion as to the\r\nsuccession of the Cretaceous and Tertiary floras in America has arisen\r\nfrom the fact that the plants which are evidently Eocene in Greenland\r\nand America have been until lately incorrectly regarded as Miocene in\r\nEurope. In the Western States, the Dakota group of Lesquereux is\r\noverlain by 2000 feet of Cretaceous beds, containing the marine shells\r\ncharacteristic of that age, but no plants. But in VancouveraEuro(TM)s Island\r\nthese same Upper Cretaceous beds contain an abundant flora, which some\r\nbotanists have called Tertiary for the reason already mentioned. Above\r\nthe 2000 feet of marine beds overlying the Dakota group is the Lower\r\nLignite group of Lesquereux, holding many fossil plants, including Palms\r\nand other evidences of a warmer climate than that of the Cretaceous, and\r\nwhich constitute a Lower Eocene flora corresponding in some respects to\r\nthat of Europe. This is succeeded by an Upper Lignite group, also\r\nEocene, but representing a more temperate climate, and therefore\r\nresembling more nearly the Cretaceous flora. This is nearly identical\r\nwith the so-called Miocene of Greenland, Alaska, and Mackenzie River,\r\nwhich the facts collected by the Canadian geologists have shown to be\r\nreally Eocene.[77] But the Canadian reports containing these facts are\r\ncomparatively little known in Europe, hence incorrect ideas as to the\r\nsuccession of these floras have been handed from one writer to another.\r\n\r\nTo those who adopt extreme views as to the refrigeration of the northern\r\nhemisphere in so-called glacial times, there is great difficulty in\r\naccounting for the continued existence of the early Tertiary flora; but\r\nif we adopt moderate views as to this, and demand merely a great\r\nsubsidence, with much reduction of mean temperature, we may suppose that\r\nthe plants previously existing were preserved on insular spots, whence\r\nthey were ready to recolonize the land on its emergence from the sea. It\r\nseems certain, however, that our continents never regained, after the\r\nGlacial period, the exuberance of plant life which they presented in the\r\nMiocene and earlier Pliocene; and we shall find that this statement\r\napplies to the world of animals as well as to that of plants. This\r\nreduction was more extreme in Europe than in Eastern Asia and Eastern\r\nAmerica, and the fact is thus accounted for in a recent lecture by Prof.\r\nAsa Gray:aEuro\"\r\n\r\naEurooeI conceive that three things have conspired to this loss. First,\r\nEurope, hardly extending south of latitude 40A deg., is all within the limits\r\ngenerally assigned to severe glacial action. Second, its mountains trend\r\neast and west, from the Pyrenees to the Carpathians and the Caucasus\r\nbeyond, near its southern border; and they had glaciers of their own,\r\nwhich must have begun their operations, and poured down the northward\r\nflanks, while the plains were still covered with forest, on the retreat\r\nfrom the great ice-wave coming from the north. Attacked both on front\r\nand rear, much of the forest must have perished then and there. Third,\r\nacross the line of retreat of those which may have flanked the\r\nmountain-ranges, or were stationed south of them, stretched the\r\nMediterranean, an impassable barrier. Some hardy trees may have eked out\r\ntheir existence on the northern shore of the Mediterranean and the\r\nAtlantic coast. But we doubt not, _Taxodium_ and _Sequoias_, _Magnolias_\r\nand _Liquidambars_, and even Hickories and the like, were among the\r\nmissing. Escape by the east, and rehabilitation from that quarter until\r\na very late period, were apparently prevented by the prolongation of the\r\nMediterranean to the Caspian, and thence to the Siberian ocean. If we\r\naccept the supposition of NordenskiAÂld, that, anterior to the Glacial\r\nperiod, Europe was aEuro~bounded on the south by an ocean extending from the\r\nAtlantic over the present deserts of Sahara and Central Asia to the\r\nPacific,aEuro(TM) all chance of these American types having escaped from or\r\nre-entered Europe from the south and east is excluded. Europe may thus\r\nbe conceived to have been for a time somewhat in the condition in which\r\nGreenland is now, and indeed to have been connected with Greenland in\r\nthis or in earlier times.[78] Such a junction, cutting off access of the\r\nGulf Stream to the Polar Sea, would, as some think, other things\r\nremaining as they are, almost of itself give glaciation to Europe.\r\nGreenland may be referred to, by way of comparison, as a country which,\r\nhaving undergone extreme glaciation, bears the marks of it in the\r\nextreme poverty of its flora, and in the absence of the plants to which\r\nits southern portion, extending six degrees below the Arctic Circle,\r\nmight be entitled. It ought to have trees, and might support them. But\r\nsince destruction by glaciation no way has been opened for their return.\r\nEurope fared much better, but suffered in its degree in a similar way.\r\n\r\naEurooeTurning for a moment to the American continent for a contrast, we find\r\nthe land unbroken and open down to the tropic, and the mountains running\r\nnorth and south. The trees, when touched on the north by the on-coming\r\nrefrigeration, had only to move their southern border southward, along\r\nan open way, as far as the exigency required; and there was no\r\nimpediment to their due return. Then the more southern latitude of the\r\nUnited States gave great advantage over Europe. On the Atlantic border,\r\nproper glaciation was felt only in the northern part, down to about\r\nlatitude 40A deg.. In the interior of the country, owing doubtless to greater\r\ndryness and summer heat, the limit receded greatly northward in the\r\nMississippi Valley, and gave only local glaciers to the Rocky Mountains;\r\nand no volcanic outbreaks or violent changes of any kind have here\r\noccurred since the types of our present vegetation came to the land. So\r\nour lines have been cast in pleasant places, and the goodly heritage of\r\nforest-trees is one of the consequences.\r\n\r\naEurooeThe still greater richness of North-east Asia in arboreal vegetation\r\nmay find explanation in the prevalence of particularly favourable\r\nconditions, both ante-glacial and recent. The trees of the Miocene\r\ncircumpolar forest appear to have found there a secure home; and the\r\nJapanese islands, to which most of these trees belong, must be\r\nremarkably adapted to them. The situation of these islandsaEuro\"analogous to\r\nthat of Great Britain, but with the advantage of lower latitude and\r\ngreater sunshinetheir ample extent north and south, their diversified\r\nconfiguration, their proximity to the great Pacific gulf-stream, by\r\nwhich a vast body of warm water sweeps along their accentuated shores,\r\nand the comparatively equable diffusion of rain throughout the year, all\r\nprobably conspire to the preservation and development of an originally\r\nample inheritance.aEuroŁ\r\n\r\nThe comparative paucity in species of the west coast of America, though\r\nthe _Sequoias_ and some other forms which have perished elsewhere are\r\nretained there, is admitted to be exceptional, and not easily explained,\r\nexcept by the supposition of peculiar local conditions affecting the\r\ncomparatively narrow strip of land between the Rocky Mountains and coast\r\nranges, and the Pacific.\r\n\r\nTo such widely-distributed and varied and complex phenomena as those\r\nwhich have been discussed in the present chapter, it is impossible to do\r\njustice in the space at our command. Details in relation to them will be\r\nfound in the publications of Heer, of Saporta, and of Lesquereux, and\r\nare well worthy of study by botanists, to whom alone they can be made\r\nfully intelligible. In general, with reference to now prevalent theories\r\nof derivation, they present two very dissimilar aspects. No difficulty\r\ncan be greater to the evolutionist than to account for the simultaneous\r\nappearance of so many modern generic forms in the Cretaceous; and the\r\nfact of many of the genera presenting more and more species the farther\r\nwe trace them back is a strange anomaly of evolution. On the other hand,\r\nthe number of species continuing unchanged from the Eocene to the\r\nModern, the others only slightly modified, and the representative\r\nspecies occurring in the floras of the old and new continents, appear to\r\nmany to give great support to the doctrine of gradual transformation of\r\nspecies. Farther facts and farther comprehension of the difference\r\nbetween species and races will be necessary to the settlement of these\r\nquestions. In the meantime it would appear that the Jurassic flora\r\nrapidly gave place, at a particular point of geological time, to that\r\nof the modern world, and this not merely in one locality, but over the\r\nwhole northern hemisphere; and there are apparently similar facts in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere as well. It farther appears that each genus was at\r\nfirst represented by many species, and that as time went on these were\r\ngradually reduced to a few best suited to survive; and that the changes\r\nof climate and level which occurred distributed these over different\r\nparts of the continents in a way at first sight very anomalous, but\r\nwhich Prof. Gray somewhat quaintly represents as follows:aEuro\"\r\n\r\naEurooeIt is as if Nature, when she had enough species of a genus to go round\r\nthe four floral regions (Europe, East Asia, West America, and East\r\nAmerica), dealt them fairly one at least to each quarter of our zone;\r\nbut when she had only two of some peculiar kind, gave one to us, and the\r\nother to Japan, Mantchuria, or the Himalayas; and when she had only one,\r\ndivided it between the two partners on the opposite sides of the table.aEuroŁ\r\n\r\nLastly, it seems very probable that many so-called species are nothing\r\nmore than varietal forms, which may very well be modified descendants of\r\nMiocene or Eocene plants now figuring in our lists under different\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIVATHERIUM GIGANTEUM.\r\n\r\nA Great Ruminant of the Miocene of India.\r\n\r\nCopied by special permission of James Murie, M.D., F.G.S., &c.]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF MAMMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe incoming of that highest order of animals in which man himself, in\r\nso far as his physical nature is concerned, takes his place, presents\r\nsome features which, though not unparalleled in the history of other\r\nforms of life, are still very striking. The modern Mammalia are somewhat\r\nsharply divided into three very unequal groups. First, those which\r\npresent in their full perfection the property of producing fully\r\ndeveloped young, which is one of the distinctive characters of the\r\nclass. These are the Placental Mammals. Secondly, those in which the\r\nyoung are produced in a very imperfect condition, and are usually\r\nnourished for a time in a marsupium or pouch. These are hence called\r\nMarsupials. They are for the most part confined to Australasia, though a\r\nfew occur in America; and are decidedly inferior in rank to the ordinary\r\nmammals. Thirdly, those in which there is a bird-like bill, and also\r\ncertain bird-like or reptilian peculiarities of skeleton and of the\r\nalimentary canal. These are the Monotremes, represented by a very few\r\nspecies in Australia and New Guinea.\r\n\r\nIn geological history, so far as the facts are at present known, the\r\nsecond group, that of the Marsupials, antedated the others by a vast\r\nlapse of time. The Marsupials appear in the Trias, near the beginning of\r\nthe Mesozoic period. The Placentals are not found until we reach the\r\nbeginning of the Tertiary. The Monotremes would seem to be a\r\ncomparatively modern degraded type. Thus the Marsupials existed\r\nthroughout the reptilian age, and this in those countries of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere in which they are not now found. The Mesozoic\r\nMarsupials were, it is true, of small size, but there were probably\r\nnumerous species, and though unable to cope with the great reptiles that\r\nswarmed by the shores and on the plains, they may have found abundant\r\nscope in the upland and interior regions of the continents.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Trias of Germany has afforded to Professor Pleininger two\r\nteeth of a small mammal, to which the name of _Microlestes antiquus_ has\r\nbeen given, under the impression that it was carnivorous, though it now\r\nseems more likely that it was a vegetable feeder. In rocks of nearly the\r\nsame age in America, Emmons found a jaw-bone of another species\r\n(_Dromatherium sylvestre_), which has been supposed to be a near ally of\r\nthe existing _Myrmecobius fasciatus_ of Australia (Figs. 166, 167). In\r\nthe Stonesfield slate, a member of the English Jurassic, several other\r\nspecies have been found (Fig. 168), and a still larger number in the\r\nfresh-water beds of the Upper Purbeck. Marsh has obtained many others\r\nfrom the Jurassic of America. None appear to have yet been found in the\r\nCretaceous, but they reappear in the Eocene Tertiary, and continue to\r\nthe modern time. Their absence in the Cretaceous is probably a mere\r\naccident, and they present an illustration of a very permanent type\r\nlittle changed since its first introduction. Lyell enumerates in all\r\nthirty-three species from the Mesozoic, all of them of small size, and\r\nall more or less nearly related to existing Australian Marsupials,\r\nthough differing much among themselves, and including both carnivorous\r\nand herbivorous forms (Fig. 169). Marsh has recently suggested a\r\nsomewhat new interpretation of these interesting mammalian remains.[79]\r\nHe considers them divisible into two groups, one allied to the modern\r\nInsectivora (Moles, Shrews, Hedgehogs, &c.), but of generalized forms.\r\nFor these he constitutes a new order (_Pantotheria_, Marsh). The other\r\ngroup is less numerous and is Marsupial (_Allotheria_, Marsh). The jaws\r\nin Figs. 166 and 168 belong to the former group, that in Fig. 169 to the\r\nlatter. We should thus have both placental and Marsupial mammals in the\r\nMesozoic. Marsh remarks that the descent of these different types from a\r\ncommon ancestry would require us to trace mammals back into the\r\nPalA|ozoic, that is, on the doctrine of gradual evolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166.aEuro\"Jaw of _Dromatherium sylvestre_ (Emmons). From\r\nthe Trias of North Carolina.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167.aEuro\"_Myrmecobius fasciatus._ A modern Australian\r\nmarsupial, allied to Mesozoic species.]\r\n\r\nSo soon as the palA|ontologist passes from the Upper Cretaceous to the\r\nEocene, he finds himself in the domain of the placental mammals, which\r\nappear in numerous and large species, and this, not merely in one\r\nregion, but in every part of the world in which these deposits are known\r\nto exist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 168.aEuro\"Jaw, and enlarged molar of _Phascolotherium\r\nBucklandi_.

The Eocene\r\nmammals, like the Carboniferous amphibians, the Mesozoic reptiles, and\r\nthe Cretaceous forests, appear to spring full-grown from the earth, and\r\nthis at nearly the same time in every part of the northern hemisphere.\r\nIt has been suggested that they may have come in gradually without our\r\nknowledge in the Cretaceous period; but if so, we should have found some\r\nof their remains along with those of the Upper Cretaceous plants. But\r\nthe prevalence of the great reptiles up to the close of the Cretaceous\r\nwould seem to render the co-existence of large mammals unlikely. It has\r\nfurther been supposed that geological changes in the southern and\r\nnorthern hemispheres may have alternated with each other, so that there\r\nmay be in the former Cretaceous beds in which the remains of ancestors\r\nof the Eocene mammals may be found. But we do not as yet know of such\r\ndeposits. We may be content, therefore, to suppose that at the close of\r\nthe Cretaceous there was established somewhere a sort of Eden for the\r\nfirst placental mammals, in which they were introduced and could live\r\nunharmed by the decaying monsters of the reptilian age, until the time\r\ncame when they could increase and multiply and replenish the earth. The\r\nnearest approach to such a centre of mammalian life is perhaps to be\r\nfound in those great American lake basins embedded in the mountains of\r\nthe West, which have been so well described by Hayden and Newberry, and\r\nwhich have yielded so many animal remains to the researches of Leidy,\r\nMarsh, and Cope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 170.aEuro\"Restoration of _PalA|otherium magnum_.\r\nEocene.aEuro\"After Cuvier and Owen.]\r\n\r\nThe typical deposits of the Early Eocene have long been those of the\r\nBasin of Paris, where thick and highly fossiliferous deposits of this\r\nage rest on the more or less denuded surface of the Upper Chalk, and\r\nhave afforded a rich harvest of remains of about fifty species of\r\nplacental quadrupeds, whose bones have been found in the gypsum quarries\r\nof Montmartre. The great majority belong to the Ungulates, or hoofed\r\nanimals, and the most abundant genera are those called by Cuvier\r\n_PalA|otherium_ (Fig. 170) and _Anoplotherium_, of which there are\r\nseveral species, and which have affinities with the modern Tapirs on the\r\none hand, and with the Horse on the other. Of the Unguiculate or clawed\r\norders there are carnivorous forms allied to the HyA|na and the Fox, a\r\nBat and a Squirrel; and the Marsupials are represented by an Opossum.\r\nLyell describes a bed of clay associated with the gypsum, in which are\r\nnumerous footprints, probably produced on the margin of a lake. Many of\r\nthese might be referred to the PalA|othere and its allies; but there are\r\nothers belonging to quadrupeds yet unknown, and there are also tracks of\r\ntortoises, crocodiles, and lizards, and of a large wading bird. Such a\r\nbed, perhaps deposited on the margin of a salt lake, resorted to as a\r\naEurooelickaEuroŁ by herbivorous animals, and by the carnivorous species which\r\npreyed on them, is well fitted, by the thronging life which it\r\nindicates, to teach how little we can know of the actual number and\r\nvariety of the old inhabitants of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn England, Eocene beds of the age of those of Paris, occupy the valley\r\nof the Thames and the Isle of Wight and neighbouring parts of Hants.\r\nThey have afforded mammalian fossils similar to those of Paris, though\r\nless abundantly, but they are rich in remains of marine animals and of\r\nland plants.\r\n\r\nInstead of describing the well-known animals of the French and English\r\nTertiaries, from these Eocene deposits upwards, I shall shortly sketch\r\nthe succession in America, as worked out by Marsh and Cope, with the aid\r\nof the admirable summary given by Gaudry of the present state of\r\nknowledge with reference to the sequence of mammalian life from its\r\nappearance in the Early Eocene up to the present time.[80]\r\n\r\nEocene mammals, especially those gigantic whale-like creatures called\r\n_Zeuglodon_ (Fig. 180), have been found in Eastern North America, but\r\nthe most remarkable discoveries have been made in the Western\r\nTerritories, where vast numbers of bones are imbedded in certain ancient\r\nand wide-spread lacustrine beds. It may be well to premise here that\r\nthough the division into Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene is recognised in\r\nAmerica as well as in Europe, the limits of these groups may not\r\nprecisely correspond with those in the Old World. Still we have this\r\ncertain point of departure, that the Eocene begins where the peculiar\r\nanimals of the Cretaceous end, and that the drying up of the later\r\nCretaceous sea and the establishment of the Eocene land were probably\r\nnearly contemporaneous in both continents. It is true, however, in\r\nanimals as in plants, that in the successive periods of the Tertiary,\r\nAmerica presents an older aspect than Europe, just as its modern fauna\r\nstill contains such old forms as the opossum.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that as the mountain-ranges and table-lands of Western\r\nAmerica emerged from the Cretaceous waters, they became clothed with\r\nEocene forests and inhabited by Eocene mammals. But the waters, dammed\r\nup by surrounding ridges, formed large lake basins, which were drained\r\nonly by the slow excavation of aEurooecaA+-onsaEuroŁ as the land rose still higher.\r\nIn the successive deposits formed in these lakes both by ordinary\r\ndeposition of silt and by paroxysmal showers of volcanic ashes were\r\nentombed great numbers of the animals which fed on their banks. It\r\nappears that these deposits, which in some places are estimated at not\r\nless than 8000 feet in thickness, hold the remains of three successive\r\nfaunas, differing materially from each other, and representing the\r\nLower, Middle, and Upper Eocene. On the flanks of the elevated region\r\nsupporting the beds formed in the Eocene lakes, are other later lake\r\nbasins of Miocene age, also abounding in animal remains. East of the\r\nRocky Mountains, and also on the Pacific coast, are still later Pliocene\r\ndeposits holding other and more modern Mammalia. The vast area of these\r\nformations and the complete sequence which they show are scarcely\r\nequalled elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 171.aEuro\"_Coryphodon Hamatus._ A Lower Eocene\r\nPerissodactyl skull, greatly reduced, showing small size of brain,\r\n_a_.aEuro\"After Marsh.]\r\n\r\nAs in the Paris basin, the large Ungulates constitute the most\r\nconspicuous feature. The great group is now usually divided into those\r\nthat are odd-toed (Perissodactyl) and those that are even-toed\r\n(Artiodactyl). Though these are apparently arbitrary characters, they\r\ncorrespond with other more fundamental differences. The first includes\r\nsuch modern animals as the Rhinoceros, Tapir, and Horse. The second\r\nincludes two somewhat distinct assemblagesaEuro\"that with mammillated teeth,\r\nof which the Hog and Hippopotamus are types (Bunodonts), and that with\r\ncrescental plates of enamel in the teeth, of which the Ruminants like\r\nthe Deer, Ox and Camel, are examples (Selenodonts).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 172.aEuro\"Fore-foot of _Coryphodon_. Greatly\r\nreduced.aEuro\"After Marsh.]\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic animals of the lowest Eocene belong to the genus\r\n_Coryphodon_ (Figs. 171, 172), which so abounded in Eocene America that\r\nbones of about 150 individuals were found by the Wheeler Expedition in\r\none year in the Eocene beds of New Mexico. These animals in their\r\ndentition approached the American tapirs, except that they had great\r\ncanines like the bear, while their feet resembled those of the elephant,\r\nand some of them attained the dimensions of the ox. _Coryphodon_ is\r\nthus, as might be expected in a primal placental mammal, a creature of\r\nsomewhat generalised type. Another point in which it resembles some at\r\nleast of its early Tertiary contemporaries is the small size of the\r\nbrain, especially in those parts of it supposed to minister to the\r\nintelligence and higher instincts (Fig. 171, _a_). It is certainly\r\nremarkable that as Tertiary time went on the successive groups of\r\nmammals were gifted with brains of larger and larger size, fitting them\r\nfor higher functions; and ultimately for associating with man. Animals\r\nthus low in development of brain were probably slow and sluggish and\r\nstubbornly ferocious, and dependent on brute force for subsistence and\r\ndefence; and they would have been altogether unsuitable for\r\ndomestication had they lived to the present time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 173.aEuro\"Skull of an Upper Eocene Perissodactyl\r\n(_Dinoceras mirabilis_), showing three pairs of horn-bases. Greatly\r\nreduced.aEuro\"After Marsh.]\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Eocene, the place of _Coryphodon_ was taken by _Dinoceras_\r\nand allied forms. Some of the species nearly equalled the elephant in\r\nsize, but had shorter and stouter limbs, each supported on five great\r\ntoesaEuro\"the most perfect possible sort of pedestal foot (Figs. 172, 174).\r\nThey were heavily armed with immense canines on the upper jaws, and two\r\nor even three pairs of horns or hard protuberances on the head (Fig.\r\n173). Creatures so supported and so armed, and living where food was\r\nplentiful, might well dispense with any great degree of intelligence,\r\nand their development of brain is consequently little better than that\r\nof _Coryphodon_. These great and characteristic Eocene families have no\r\nknown successors; and in the Miocene age their place is taken by a very\r\ndifferent group, that of which _Brontotherium_ is the type (Fig. 175).\r\nThey are creatures of huge size, with a pair of horn-cores on the nose,\r\nand feet with four toes in front and three behind, resembling in form\r\nthose of the rhinoceros.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 174.aEuro\"Fore-foot of _Dinoceras_.

In the Lower Eocene are found the remains of a diminutive\r\nungulate (_Eohippus_), of the stature of a moderately-sized dog. It has\r\nfour toes and a rudiment of a fifth in front, and three toes behind; and\r\nhas teeth slightly resembling those of the horse, but more simple and\r\nshorter in the crown. In this creature it has been supposed that we have\r\na direct ancestor of the modern horse. A very similar genus\r\n(_Orohippus_), lacking only the fifth rudimentary toe, replaces\r\n_Eohippus_ in the Middle Eocene. _Mesohippus_ of the Lower Miocene is as\r\nlarge as a sheep, and has only three toes on the fore-foot and a splint\r\nbone, while its teeth assume a more equine character (Fig. 176). In the\r\nUpper Miocene _Miohippus_ continues the line, while _Protohippus_ of the\r\nLower Pliocene is still more equine and as large as an ass, and\r\ncorresponds with the European _Hipparion_ in having the middle toe of\r\neach foot alone long enough to reach the ground. In the Upper Pliocene\r\ntrue horses appear with only a single toe, and splint bones instead of\r\nthe others. In America, though the horse was unknown at the time of the\r\ndiscovery of the continent, several species occur in the Tertiary and\r\nPost-Pliocene, showing that the genus existed there up to a\r\ncomparatively late period; and when re-introduced it has thriven and run\r\nwild in the more temperate regions. What cause could have led to its\r\nextinction in Post-Glacial times is as yet a mystery. This genealogy of\r\nthe horse, independently of its evolutionist application, is very\r\ninteresting. It shows that some Eocene types were suited to continuance,\r\nand even adapted for extension, while others were destined to become\r\naltogether extinct at an early date. It shows farther that the power of\r\ncontinuance resided not so much in the gigantic and prominent species as\r\nin smaller forms. It is to be observed, however, that Gaudry and other\r\northodox evolutionists in Europe deduce the horse, not from _Eohippus_,\r\nbut from _PalA|otherium_, and that it is equally impossible to verify\r\neither phylogeny, since the mere sequence of more or less closely allied\r\nspecies in time does not prove continuous derivation. Nor indeed are we\r\ncertain that one-toed horses like those now living did not exist on the\r\ndry plains in Eocene times, since the inhabitants of these plains are\r\nprobably unknown to us. An amusing illustration of the probable reason\r\nof the disappearance of the missing links has recently been given by a\r\nwriter not very favourable to the new philosophy. The several\r\nconsecutive species may be represented by coins. We may suppose, for\r\nexample, sixpences to have been coined first, then sevenpenny and\r\neightpenny pieces, and so on up to a shilling, then pieces representing\r\nthirteen, fourteen and fifteen pence, and so on up to a half-crown or\r\ncrown; but all the intervening denominations between the sixpence and\r\nthe shilling, and between the shilling and the half-crown, were found\r\npractically of little use. Hence few were coined, and they soon became\r\nobsolete. Thus the antiquary would find only a few denominations, and\r\nthose connecting them would be seldom or never found. It is plain that\r\nif we could suppose that nations constructed their coinage after this\r\nunthinking and empirical fashion, and that if we were justified in\r\nascribing a similar procedure to the Creator, it might help to account\r\nfor the facts as we find them, otherwise we should rather suppose that\r\nin both cases something like plan and calculation determined the\r\nselection of the species produced, whether of coins or animals. But\r\nChance is a blind goddess, and if we instal her as creator, we must\r\nexpect the work to proceed by a series of abortive experiments.\r\n\r\nThe Perissodactyls are not numerous at present. The three groups\r\nrepresented by the Horse, Rhinoceros, and Tapir constitute the whole;\r\nand the two latter forms can be traced back to predecessors in Eocene\r\ntimes, even more closely resembling them than those supposed to be\r\nancestors of the horse resemble that animal. But the few species now\r\nliving have thus a vast surplusage of possible ancestors. Many species\r\nand genera are dropped without any modern representatives, so that the\r\ntendency has been to a gradual elimination of surplus types, until only\r\na few isolated and somewhat specialised forms remain at present. Yet\r\nthis process of elimination is not necessarily an evolution or survival\r\nof the fittest, in the sense of modern derivationists. It rather implies\r\nthat in certain past states of the earth the conditions of life afforded\r\nscope for many forms not now required, or replaced by other types more\r\nsuited to the advanced and specialised nature of the world.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Artiodactyls have gained in numbers and\r\nimportance, in comparison with their odd-toed comrades; and this, though\r\nan odd number, namely five, was the typical number with which the\r\nearliest quadrupedal forms began life far back in the PalA|ozoic. The\r\ntypical Artiodactyls are those that cleave the hoof, and many of which\r\nalso chew the cud; and they are of all others, the horse perhaps\r\nexcepted, those that are most valuable to man. The lower type\r\n(Bunodont), to which the hog belongs, is the older; and many hog-like\r\nanimals occur from the earlier Tertiary upwards. In the Upper Eocene,\r\neven-toed species appear with an approach at least to the\r\ncrescent-shaped teeth of the modern deer and oxen. Some of the species\r\nare obviously forerunners of the modern antelopes and deer, though as\r\nyet destitute of horns or antlers. Others, like _Oreodon_, are of more\r\nhog-like aspect, though believed to have been ruminants (Fig. 177).\r\nThese are characteristic of the Middle Miocene, at which stage true deer\r\nappear in Europe (_Dicroceras_), though they are not known in America\r\nuntil the Pliocene period. The earliest deer have small and simple\r\nantlers, these ornaments becoming larger and more elaborate in\r\napproaching the modern era. The hollow-horned ruminants appear for the\r\nfirst time in America in the Lower Pliocene; and no ancestry has so far\r\nbeen attempted to be traced for them. The antelopes of this group, as\r\nwell as the gigantic _Sivatherium_ of India,[81] allied to the modern\r\nprong-horned antelope of North America, were prominent in the Old World\r\nin the Miocene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 177.aEuro\"_Oreodon major._ A generalised Miocene\r\nruminant, with affinities to the Deer, Camel, and Hog.

Greatly reduced.]\r\n\r\nA very noteworthy and specially American group of mammals is that of the\r\n_Edentates_, the Sloths and Ant-eaters, a group which _A  priori_ we\r\nshould have supposed would have been one of the earliest in time. They\r\nappear, however, first in the Miocene, without even any suggested\r\nancestry, and are represented from the first by large species, though\r\nthey attain their grandest stature in the _Megatherium_ and _Mylodon_ of\r\nthe Post-Pliocene (Figs. 178, 179), which were sloths of so gigantic\r\nsize that they must have pulled down trees to feed on their leaves,\r\nunless, indeed, there were trees equally colossal for them to climb. But\r\nbefore the modern time, like the American horses, the larger herbivorous\r\nforms suddenly disappear, and are now represented only by a few\r\ndiminutive South American species, which can scarcely, by any stretch of\r\nimagination, be supposed to be descendants of their gigantic\r\npredecessors. The history of these animals, like those of the great\r\nTertiary marsupials of Australia and the many Miocene elephants of\r\nIndia, affords a remarkable illustration of the persistence of similar\r\ngroups of creatures in successive ages in the same region, along with\r\ndiminution in magnitude and number of species toward the modern times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 180.aEuro\"Tooth of Eocene Whale (_Zeuglodon cetioides_).\r\nOne-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe Whale-tribe (Cetaceans) at once in the earliest Eocene takes the\r\nplace of the great Sea-lizards of the Cretaceous; and the oldest of the\r\nwhales are in their dentition more perfect than any of their successors,\r\nsince their teeth are each implanted by two roots, and have serrated\r\ncrowns, like those of the Seals. The great Eocene whales of the Southern\r\nAtlantic (_Zeuglodon_) (Fig. 180), which have these characters, attained\r\nthe length of seventy feet, and are undoubtedly the first of the whales\r\nin rank as well as in time. This is perhaps one of the most difficult\r\nfacts to be explained on the theory of evolution. Allied to the whales\r\nis the small and peculiar group of the Sea-cows or Dugongs\r\n(_Sirenians_). These creatures, highly specialised and very distinct\r\nfrom all others, appear in the Early Tertiary in forms very similar to\r\nthose which now exist, and probably in much more numerous species, and\r\nthey pursue the even tenor of their way down to modern times without\r\nperceptible elevation or degradation. aEurooeWe have questioned,aEuroŁ says Gaudry,\r\nwhen speaking of the Tertiary Cetaceans, aEurooethese strange and gigantic\r\nsovereigns of the Tertiary oceans as to their progenitorsaEuro\"they leave us\r\nwithout reply.aEuroŁ Their silence is the more significant as one can\r\nscarcely suppose these animals to have been nurtured in any limited or\r\nsecluded space in the early stages of their development. The true Seals,\r\nwhich are more elevated than the Whales, and very different in type,\r\nappear much later, and without any probable ancestry.\r\n\r\nThe Elephants, two or three species of which constitute in the modern\r\nworld the sole representatives of an order, are a remnant of an ancient\r\nrace once vastly more numerous. They appear in Europe and Asia in the\r\nMiocene, when they were represented by three distinct genera (_Elephas_,\r\n_Mastodon_, and _Dinotherium_). The second genus (Fig. 181) differs from\r\nthe proper Elephants in having tuberculated teeth, indicating a more\r\nswinish habit, and probably a more fierce disposition. The third (Fig.\r\n182) is remarkable for the immense size of some of its species, far\r\nexceeding the modern Elephants, and has the farther peculiarity of a\r\npair of descending tusks on the lower jaw, constituting a strong and\r\nheavy grubbing-hoe, with which it could probably dig deeply for roots.\r\nSo important was the group in Miocene times that seven elephants are\r\nalready known from this formation in India alone, besides three species\r\nof Mastodon. Four or five Miocene Mastodons are known in Europe, besides\r\ntwo _Dinotheria_; and the true Elephants appear there in the Pliocene,\r\nand continue to the beginning of the Modern. The elephantine animals are\r\nnot known in America till the Pliocene, but in that and the Pleistocene,\r\nand perhaps up to the human period, the western continent, now\r\naltogether destitute of elephants, possessed several species both of\r\n_Elephas_ and _Mastodon_, which extended, as in Siberia, even into the\r\nArctic regions; and, as we know from specimens preserved in a frozen\r\nstate in the latter region, some of the species were so protected by\r\ndense fur as to be able to endure extreme cold. The candid Gaudry closes\r\nhis summary of the history and affinities of the elephantine animals\r\nwith the words: aEurooeHowever, the sum of the differences compared with that\r\nof the resemblances is too great to permit us to indicate any relation\r\nof descent between the proboscidians and the animals of other orders\r\nknown to us at present.aEuroŁ So these greatest of all the animals of the\r\nland, with their strangely specialised forms and almost human sagacity,\r\nstand alone, without father or mother, without descent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 181.aEuro\"_Mastodon ohioticus._ An American Elephant.\r\nPost-Glacial.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 182.aEuro\"Head of _Dinotherium giganteum_. Greatly\r\nreduced. Miocene of Europe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 183.aEuro\"Wing of _Vespertilio aquensis_. An Eocene Bat.\r\nAfter Gaudry.]\r\n\r\nThe Rodents, or gnawing animals, appear in the Early Eocene on both\r\ncontinents in familiar forms allied to our Squirrels and Rats.\r\nPorcupines and Beavers are added in the Miocene. This group seems thus\r\nto have continued much as it was; and it is still perhaps represented by\r\nas many species as at any previous time. Many of the ancient forms were,\r\nhowever, much larger than any modern species, and some of these larger\r\nforms[82] present singular points of approach to very distinct types,\r\nas, for example, to that of the Bears; but these large and composite\r\nspecies are long since extinct. The insectivorous mammals have much the\r\nsame history with the Rodents. Such highly specialised and abnormal\r\nforms as the Bats might be supposed to be modern. But, strange to say,\r\nthey appear with fully developed wings both in Europe and America in the\r\nEocene (Fig. 183). Gaudry thinks that it is aEurooenatural to supposeaEuroŁ that\r\nthere must have been species existing previously with shorter fingers\r\nand rudimentary wings; but there are no facts to support this\r\nsupposition, which is the more questionable since the supposed\r\nrudimentary wings would be useless, and perhaps harmful to their\r\npossessors. Besides, if from the Eocene to the present the Bats have\r\nremained the same, how long would it take to develop an animal with\r\nordinary feet, like those of a shrew, into a bat?\r\n\r\nThe Early Eocene was not altogether a time of peace in the animal world.\r\nThe old carnivorous Saurians were dead and buried, but their place was\r\ntaken by carnivorous mammals, allied to our modern Tigers, HyA|nas,\r\nFoxes, and Weasels. The Carnivora, however, were subordinate in the\r\nEocene, and, as already remarked, some of them appear to be intermediate\r\nbetween marsupial and placental formsaEuro\"a fact which evolutionists have\r\nnoticed with much satisfaction. They appear to attain to their\r\nculmination in the Miocene, when their powers seem to be proportionate\r\nto those of the great and well-armed quadrupeds they had to deal with.\r\nTo this age belongs the introduction of the terrible aEurooeCymetar-toothed\r\nTigeraEuroŁ (_Machairodus_, Fig. 184). Its huge tusk-like canines and\r\npowerful limbs seem to fit it more than any other of the cat family for\r\ndestructive efficiency. Yet ordinary cat-like animals were contemporary\r\nwith it, and have survived it, since _Machairodus_ disappears in the\r\nPost-Pliocene, though in previous periods it had been very widely\r\ndistributed on both continents. It is a curious fact, perhaps of more\r\nsignificance in various ways than we yet understand, that the Dog-bear\r\n(_Arctocyon_), of the oldest French Eocene, believed to be the oldest\r\nplacental mammal known, though technically placed among the Carnivora,\r\nhas a kind of dentition indicating that, like the modern Bears, it was\r\nreally omnivorous; and its skull shows some peculiarities tending to\r\nthose of the Marsupials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 184.aEuro\"Skull of a Cymetar-toothed Tiger (_Machairodus\r\ncultridens_). Pliocene, France. Reduced.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 185.aEuro\"Lower Jaw of _Dryopithecus Fontani_. An\r\nAnthropoid Ape of the Middle Miocene of France. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nMuch interest attaches to the first appearance of the order of Apes\r\n(_Quadrumana_), or, if we take the somewhat deceptive classification\r\nfavoured by some modern zoologists, the _Primates_, including the apes\r\nand man. They begin in the Eocene, both in Europe and America, with the\r\nlowest tribe, that of the Lemurs, now confined to the island of\r\nMadagascar and parts of Africa and Southern Asia, and which may, Gaudry\r\nthinks, be modified Marsupials, though he admits that this is hard to\r\nunderstand. He mentions the resemblance of the teeth of monkeys to those\r\nof some hog-like animals, a resemblance, however, merely marking a\r\nsimilarity of food, and suggests on this ground that some of the\r\nprimitive ancestors of the hog may have also given rise to the Monkeys.\r\nIn the Miocene of Europe and Asia we have true Apes; and one of these,\r\nwhich rivals man in stature (_Dryopithecus_), belongs to the group of\r\nthe gibbons, or long-armed apes, one of the higher families of the\r\nmodern _Quadrumana_ (Fig. 185). This animal presents, indeed, the\r\nnearest approach to man made by any Tertiary mammal. Still the\r\ndifferences are great, as, for instance, in the much larger size of the\r\ncanines and premolars. Yet so much confidence has Gaudry in the\r\nresemblances, that he even ventures to suggest that certain flint chips\r\nfound in the Miocene of Thenay, and which have been supposed to indicate\r\nhuman workmanship, may have been chipped by the hands of _Dryopithecus_.\r\nShould this view be adopted by evolutionists, it will at least have the\r\neffect of preventing flint chips from being received as evidences of the\r\nantiquity of man.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to sum up this review of the history of the\r\nTertiary mammals. Much that has been said may be modified or changed by\r\nfuture discoveries; but the great facts of the late appearance of the\r\nplacental mammals, of their rapid introduction, with their ordinal\r\ndifferentiation nearly complete over all the continents, of the speedy\r\nculmination and early decadence of many types, and of the unchanged\r\npermanence of others, must in the main be sustained. It is not too much\r\nto say that to account for these facts the evolutionist must abandon the\r\nidea of gradual change, and adopt that of aEurooecritical periodsaEuroŁ when sudden\r\nchanges occurred. The history becomes inexplicable, unless with Mivart,\r\nLe Conte, and Saporta, we admit aEurooeperiods of rapid evolutionaEuroŁ alternating\r\nwith others of stagnation or retrogression; and if we admit these, we\r\npractically fall back on the old idea of creation; only it may perhaps\r\nbe aEurooeCreation by Law.aEuroŁ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONTEMPORARIES OF POST-GLACIAL MAN. From a painting by\r\nWaterhouse Hawkins.]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENT OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto we have met with no trace of man or of his works. Yet there\r\nhave been in our upward progress from the dawn of life mute prophecies\r\nof his advent. Man is in his bodily frame a vertebrate animal and a\r\nmammal; and when first the Amphibians were introduced in the PalA|ozoic,\r\nthe framework of manaEuro(TM)s body was already sketched out and its principles\r\nsettled. Those great reptilian lords, the biped Saurians of the\r\nMesozoic, already foreshadowed his erect posture, though their limbs may\r\nhave been more ornithic than mammalian. The gradual advance in the\r\nbrain-development of the Tertiary mammals presaged a coming time when\r\nmind would obtain the mastery over claw and tooth and horn; and in the\r\nMiocene ages there was already some hint of the precise style of\r\nstructure in which this new creative idea would be realised. Yet it\r\nmight have been impossible to imagine beforehand the vast changes which\r\nthis new idea would inaugurate. In the lower animals such intelligence\r\nas they possess is so tied to the physical organisation that it\r\nmanifests itself as a mechanical unvarying instinct. Man bursts this\r\nbond, and in doing so revolutionises the whole scheme of nature. Old\r\nthings are now put to new uses, the face of nature is changed, varied\r\narts are introduced, and thought enters into the domain of general and\r\nabstract truth. Objects are arranged, classified, understood, and while\r\nin some respects the whole creation is made to groan under the tyrannous\r\ninventions of man, yet these are the inventions of imagination and\r\ndesign. They are the triumph, not of brute force, but of will and\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nThat man was not in all the earlier ages of the world, except in these\r\nprophecies of his coming, geology assures us. That he is, we know. How\r\nhe came to be, is, independently of Divine revelation, an impenetrable\r\nmysteryaEuro\"one which it is doubtful if in all its bearings science will\r\never be competent to solve. Yet there are legitimate scientific\r\nquestions of great interest relating to the time and manner of his\r\nappearance, and to the condition of his earlier existence and subsequent\r\nhistory, which belong to geology, and in which so great stores of\r\nmaterial have been accumulated that a treatise rather than a chapter\r\nwould be required for their discussion. We may endeavour to select a few\r\nof the more important points.\r\n\r\nOne of the first questions meeting us is that which relates to the point\r\nin geological time signalised by the advent of our species. In the\r\nEocene period our continents were being gradually raised out of the\r\nocean, and were still in great part under the waters, which several\r\ntimes returned upon the land, and seemed ready again to engulf it. In\r\nthis period not only have we no traces of man, but all the higher\r\nanimals of that age are now extinct. In the later Eocene and Miocene the\r\nextent of land became greater, but it was so disposed as to allow the\r\ninflux into the Arctic Sea of vast volumes of heated water from the\r\nequatorial regions; and there may have been also astronomical causes at\r\nwork to increase this influx of warm water, and so to raise the\r\ntemperature of the Arctic regions still higher.[83] The middle period of\r\nthe Tertiary was undoubtedly a time very favourable to the wide\r\ndistribution of the higher forms of life both animal and vegetable. But\r\nwe cannot trace man or any of the contemporary mammals back to the\r\nMiocene. In the Pliocene the continents had attained to their present\r\nelevations, and climates were not dissimilar from those prevailing at\r\npresent; but still we have no certain indication of the presence of man;\r\nand if other modern mammals extend back to this period their number is\r\nvery small. In this age also the greater part of the continents must\r\nhave been covered with a great thickness of soil and disintegrated rock\r\nfavourable to vegetation, and there seemed nothing to preclude the\r\nintroduction of man. But a new and at first sight most unfavourable\r\nchange was to intervene. Whether through internal changes affecting the\r\ndistribution of land and water, or through astronomical vicissitudes,\r\nthe northern hemisphere, and possibly the whole world, entered on an era\r\nof refrigeration, the so-called aEurooeGlacial AgeaEuroŁ of the Post-Pliocene or\r\nPleistocene period. That in this period our continents as far south as\r\nthe latitude of 40A deg. were overwhelmed with ice or ice-laden seas is\r\nrendered evident by the fact that the whole surface up to several\r\nthousands of feet above the sea-level has been bared of its accumulated\r\n_dA(C)bris_ and polished and grooved by ice, and laden with boulders and\r\nother glacial deposits, while in many places at heights of even 1,000 or\r\n1,200 feet these deposits contain sea-shells of species now living in\r\nthe colder parts of the ocean. These phenomena do not exist in the\r\ntropical regions, except in the vicinity of high mountains, but they\r\nrecur in the southern hemisphere. It is still uncertain whether the\r\nperiod of greatest cold in the two hemispheres was at the same time or\r\nin successive ages. Geologically, however, they are approximately\r\ncontemporaneous, both occurring between the end of the Pliocene and the\r\nmodern period; but nevertheless they may not have coincided in absolute\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nVery different views have been held as to the precise condition of the\r\ncontinents in the Glacial Age, though all agree in the prevalence of\r\ncold and the action of ice, and in the fact of a great submergence at\r\none or more stages of the period. My own conclusions, which I have\r\nadvocated elsewhere,[84] and which are based on extensive study of the\r\nnorthern parts of America, where the deposits of this age are more\r\nwidely developed than elsewhere, are that there was one great\r\nsubsidence, leading to a condition in which the lower levels of the\r\ncontinents were covered with ice-laden water and the higher regions were\r\noccupied with permanent snow and glaciers. This submergence went on till\r\neven high mountains 4,000 feet or more in elevation were under water.\r\nThen there was a gradual though intermittent elevation, during which the\r\nclimate became ameliorated, and lastly there was a condition in which\r\nthe land of the northern hemisphere stood higher than at present, and\r\nwhich immediately preceded the modern period. As these conditions have\r\ngreat significance in relation to the appearance of man, I have\r\ntabulated them for reference as they occur in Scandinavia, Great\r\nBritain, and North America. The so-called aEurooeInterglacial PeriodsaEuroŁ of some\r\ngeologists are in reality local results of the stages of intermittent\r\nelevation in which were deposited beds which in some cases, as in\r\nScotland, Sweden, and Eastern Canada, hold sea-shells, and in others, as\r\nin the central areas of North America, contain remains of plants of\r\nnorthern species.\r\n\r\nWe shall name, for convenience, the parts of this Pleistocene revolution\r\nwhich include the great subsidence and glaciation, the _Glacial_ Age,\r\nthat extending from the re-elevation to the modern the _Post-glacial_.\r\n\r\nThe Glacial Age proved fatal to a large proportion of the land life of\r\nthe previous periods. According to Professor Boyd Dawkins, out of\r\nfifty-three species known in Britain in the Post-glacial, only twelve\r\nare survivors of the Pliocene; and probably the proportions would not be\r\ngreater in any part of the northern hemisphere. Some, however, did\r\nsurvive, either by migrating southward or by being inhabitants of places\r\nless severely affected than most by the general cold and submergence.\r\nThere was thus no absolute break in the chain of life effected by the\r\nGlacial Age.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF PLEISTOCENE DEPOSITS IN SCANDINAVIA, ENGLAND, AND AMERICA.\r\n(Order descending.)\r\n\r\n +---------------------+--------------------+--------------------------+\r\n |     SCANDINAVIA.    |   GREAT BRITAIN.   |       NORTH AMERICA.     |\r\n |      (Torell.)      |    (Lyell, &c.)    |                          |\r\n +---------------------+--------------------+--------------------------+\r\n |                     |                    |                          |\r\n | Valley-clays and    | Hoxne Deposits and | Terrace Gravels          |\r\n |   Heath-sands of    |   Upper Terrace    |   and Loess              |\r\n |   Sweden.

In answer to this, I think\r\nit is now generally admitted that he is not certainly known earlier than\r\nthe Post-glacial period. Various supposed indications of his presence in\r\naEurooeInterglacialaEuroŁ Glacial, Pliocene, and even Miocene deposits have proved\r\non examination to be unreliable. America has recently put forth claims\r\nto have been inhabited by man in the Pliocene, on the faith of remains\r\nfound in auriferous gravels in the West. But the facts that the\r\nimplements and bones found are modern in type, that the gravels were\r\ndeeply mined by the Indians, and that the objects found, as mortars for\r\ndressing gravel, etc., are in many cases such as they would be likely to\r\nleave in their excavations, have discredited these supposed discoveries.\r\nStill more recently, chipped flints found in gravels in New Jersey, by\r\nAbbott, have been supposed to carry back the Indians of the East coast\r\nto the Glacial period. It is evident, however, from the description of\r\nthese deposits by the late Mr. Belt and by Professor Cook, director of\r\nthe Survey of New Jersey, that they are really Post-glacial, that their\r\nage must be estimated by study of the local conditions, and that there\r\nis no good ground for correlating them with the upper members of the\r\ntrue Glacial drift to the northwards, with which they had been somewhat\r\nrashly identified. Irrespective of the doubtful character of many if not\r\nall of the so-called implements, the deposits in which they are found is\r\nconfessedly not a product of the ice of the Glacial period proper,\r\nwhether that was, as some maintain, a period of land glaciation as far\r\nsouth as New Jersey or not. It belongs to a time of denudation by water,\r\naided perhaps by floating ice, and is not necessarily older than the\r\nriver gravels of the Somme, which, like it, contain boulders and imply\r\nconditions of torrential action and climate which have long since passed\r\naway. If, however, these implements are genuine, they would imply the\r\npresence of PalA|ocosmic or Antediluvian man in America. This would in\r\nitself be an important discovery.\r\n\r\nFor the present, therefore, man is geologically a Post-glacial species,\r\nand there is nothing unreasonable in supposing that he dates no farther\r\nback, since several animals his contemporaries are in the same case; and\r\nby supposing him to have originated after the Glacial age we avoid the\r\ndifficulties attendant on his survival of that great revolution. The\r\nonly necessity for supposing an earlier appearance arises from the\r\nrequirements of the hypothesis of evolution. Those, however, who hold\r\nthis theory, may with Haeckel take refuge in that shadowy continent\r\nsupposed to have extended from Africa to Australia,[85] and to have\r\nsheltered man in his transition from the ape to humanity, in the\r\nTertiary period. The name Lemuria is taken from the Lemurs, supposed\r\nancestors of the Apes, which still haunt the margin of the Indian Ocean;\r\nbut it may be taken also in its old Latin sense of ghosts of the evil\r\ndead; and as we are not likely to obtain any more tangible evidence of\r\nthe old natives of Lemuria, perhaps we may hope that some spiritualist\r\nmay succeed in charming them from the vasty deep for our enlightenment.\r\nShould this be so, it is to be hoped that no aEurooedrum ecclesiasticaEuroŁ will be\r\nbeaten to drive them away till they have revealed all they can tell.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to add that, in addition to the negative evidence, there\r\nis at least one positive evidence of the recent origin of man which has\r\nbeen well urged by Le Conte. It is this: animals have continued long in\r\ngeological time in the inverse ratio of their rank. Some Mesozoic\r\nprotozoa still survive. So do many early Tertiary mollusks. But the\r\nmammals are of much less duration. No living species goes back farther\r\nthan the Pliocene. Few extend farther than the Glacial age. On the same\r\nprinciple it is not to be expected that man, the highest of all animals,\r\nshould extend far back in geological time.\r\n\r\nAccepting the Post-glacial age as that of the advent of man, it may be\r\ninteresting to ask what we know of the condition of our continents when\r\nhe appeared. In Western Asia, in Europe, except in its more northern\r\nportions, and it would now seem also in America, man had been introduced\r\nat a time closely following the emergence of the land from the Glacial\r\nsea. At this time the land area of both continents was larger than it is\r\nat present, and the character of the fauna shows that much of the\r\nsurface was occupied with great steppes or prairies, over which\r\nmigration would be easy; while there were probably connections by land\r\nor chains of islands between the continents of the northern hemisphere.\r\nThe land animals of the continents were more numerous and of greater\r\nstature than at present. Several species of elephants (Fig. 186) and a\r\nrhinoceros roamed over the plains. The formidable _Elasmotherium_ (Fig.\r\n187),[86] an animal allied to the rhinoceros, but more fleet and active,\r\nand of immense size, inhabited Asia and Europe. Hippopotami, wild\r\nhorses, the gigantic Irish stag, several species of wild cattle, and\r\nbisons of greater size than their successors, haunted the streams and\r\nsteppes. The cave bear, the cave lion, the spotted hyA|na, and possibly\r\nthe _Machairodus_, were among the beasts of prey even in the temperate\r\nlatitudes. The climate must have been a continental one, ranging through\r\nconsiderable extremes; but the conditions favoured migration of animals\r\non the great scale, so as to avoid these extremes, and hence species of\r\ntypes now comparatively restricted enjoyed a wide distribution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 186.aEuro\"_Elephas primigenius._ Post-glacial.]\r\n\r\nTo establish themselves in such a world, the primitive men must have\r\nbeen no puny race, either in mind or body, and they must have been\r\nsheltered in some Eden of plenty and comparative safety till, by\r\nincrease of numbers, invention of weapons and implements, and\r\ndomestication of useful animals, they became able to cope with the\r\nmonarchs of the waste. But this position once attained in the original\r\nseats of the species, the wide continents presented great facilities for\r\ntheir movements, and there were ample stores of food for wandering\r\ntribes subsisting by the chase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 187.aEuro\"Tooth of _Elasmotherium_. Grinding surface,\r\nnatural size. Siberia. From _Nature_.]\r\n\r\nWith such views the skeletons of the most ancient known men[87] fully\r\naccord. They indicate a people of great stature, of powerful muscular\r\ndevelopment, especially in the lower limbs, of large brain, indicating\r\ngreat capacity and resources (Fig. 188), but of coarse Turanian\r\nfeatures, like those of the tribes that now roam over the plains of\r\nNorthern Asia (Fig. 189). They used flint and bone implements, which\r\nthey manufactured with much skill (Figs. 190, 191). They were probably\r\nclothed in dressed skins, ornamented with embroidery, in the manner of\r\nthe North American Indians. They used shells and carved bones as\r\nornaments. Recent discoveries at Soloutre, in France, render it probable\r\nthat some of the tribes had tamed the horse, and resided in fortified\r\nvillages. They buried their dead with offerings, indicating a belief in\r\nimmortality. These Post-glacial men are certainly known as yet only in\r\nEurope and Western Asia; and we cannot therefore determine if they\r\nrepresent the average man of the period. There were in Belgium and other\r\nparts of Europe, men of smaller stature and of lower cranial type,\r\ncontemporary or nearly so with the higher race. There may have been\r\nfruit-eating or agricultural peoples in the more genial and fertile\r\nlands of the east and south. The conditions above sketched are, I think,\r\nfairly deducible from the facts stated by Christy and Lartet, Dupont,\r\nRiviA\"re, Dawkins, and others, who have studied the remains of these\r\nearly men, the PalA|olithic men of some writers, or the men of the\r\nMammoth age, and whom I have elsewhere named PalA|ocosmic men, as a term\r\nless objectionable than those founded on implements not confined to any\r\nage, or animals which may have long antedated man. Recent discoveries in\r\nthe caves of Spy in Belgium,[88] taken in connection with the previous\r\ndiscoveries of Schmerling and Dupont, seem to show the existence in that\r\ncountry of men of the low-browed Neanderthal or Canstadt type (Fig. 189\r\nthird outline), perhaps locally preceding but perhaps contemporaneous\r\nwith, the larger and better developed men of the Cro-Magnon type (Fig.\r\n189 first outline). These two types are, however, allied, and there are\r\nintermediate forms, so that they are to be regarded as two races of\r\nPalA|ocosmic men not more dissimilar than we find in cognate rude races\r\nat present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 188.aEuro\"Engis Skull.

The cause of these changes\r\nmust have been physical, and to some extent cataclysmal; and its\r\nwide-spread and effectual character is shown by the fact that it\r\nexterminated so many animals of both continents which had survived the\r\nGlacial age. Similar testimony is borne by the occurrence of the\r\nimplements and remains of PalA|ocosmic men in gravels and in diluvial\r\nclays in caverns, and by the changes of level and deep erosions of\r\nvalleys that are referable to the close of the PalA|ocosmic age. The most\r\nprobable agencies in this revolution were subsidences of the land,\r\naccompanied with climatal changes; but the precise nature and extent of\r\nthese is still unknown; and the prevalent tendency on the part of\r\ngeologists to stretch the doctrine of uniformity, so valuable within\r\nproper limits, to the absurd extreme of excluding all changes not\r\nexemplified even in amount in the modern period, will probably for some\r\ntime prevent any adequate conception of them.\r\n\r\nIt would be premature to correlate what is yet known of the PalA|ocosmic\r\nage with historical periods; but the tendency of the facts accumulated\r\nis, I think, toward the identification of the PalA|ocosmic men with the\r\nAntediluvians; and their Neocosmic successors, whether of the reindeer\r\nage, of the Danish shell-mounds, or the Swiss lake habitations, with\r\nPostdiluvian and still existing tribes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 190.aEuro\"Flint Implement found in KentaEuro(TM)s Cavern,\r\nTorquay, under four feet of cave mud and one foot of stalagmite.aEuro\"After\r\nPengelly.]\r\n\r\nAfter what has been already said, it will be unnecessary to dwell upon\r\nthe characteristics of the first race of men known to us. They were rude\r\nand uncivilised, in so far as outward appliances are concerned; but they\r\nare confessedly altogether men, and in no respect akin to apes, and\r\ntheir volume of brain is rather greater than that of the average\r\nEuropean of to-day; so that they must have had quite as much natural\r\nsagacity and capacity for culture, and, like the modern and historic\r\nTuranian nations, they were probably superior to the average European in\r\nthe instinct for art and construction. Thus if we suppose these men\r\nderived from apes by any process of gradual change, we must look for\r\ntheir brute ancestors, not in the Pliocene or Miocene, but in the Eocene\r\nitself. This causes us to recur to the doctrine of critical periods,\r\nwhen many species were introduced together, alternating with periods of\r\ndecay and extinction. Post-glacial man appears at the end of a time of\r\nsifting and trial, a time in which a vast number of species succumbed to\r\ngreat physical reverses. No very great number of species came in with\r\nhim, and in the early period of his history there was a decadence or\r\ndestruction either by the diluvial cataclysm or gradually. Out of\r\nninety-eight species of mammals contemporary with early man in Europe,\r\nforty-one are wholly or locally extinct, and none have been introduced\r\nexcept those brought by man himself. Thus man stands alone, the grand\r\nproduct of his period and a lord of creation, for whom great preparatory\r\nchanges were made, and multitudes of lower animals swept away to make\r\nroom for him. According to our sacred Scriptures, this change is still\r\nimperfect, and great additional ameliorations would have taken place but\r\nfor a moral catastrophe not within the domain of geologyaEuro\"the fall of\r\nman. If we identify the PalA|ocosmic men with the Antediluvians of the\r\nsame venerable record, the roving tribes whose remains are known to us\r\nrepresent that part of the race of Cain of whom Jubal was the father,\r\nthe nomads dwelling in tents, as distinguished from the settled\r\nagricultural peoples. In this case, also, the catastrophe which\r\ndestroyed these rude and lawless men was that which culminated in the\r\ndeluge of Noah, which may represent the extinction of the last great\r\nbody of this primitive race, whose arts, handed down to the physically\r\ninferior men of Postdiluvian times, astonish us by their early\r\ndevelopment in ChaldA|a and in Egypt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 191.aEuro\"Bone Harpoon (PalA|ocosmic), from PA(C)rigord\r\nCavern.]\r\n\r\nIf man is so recent geologically, he may still be very old historically;\r\nand the question remains, Have we any facts bearing on the absolute\r\nantiquity of man? For the properly historical aspect of this question,\r\nI may refer to the excellent work of Canon Rawlinson on the _Origin of\r\nNations_,[89] which shows conclusively that the historic origin of all\r\nthe great nations of antiquity extends backward less than 4,400 years\r\nfrom our time. Beyond this we have, however, the PalA|ocosmic or\r\nAntediluvian men; and their extension backward seems limited\r\ngeologically only by the close of the Glacial period, while many hold\r\nthat the Genealogy in Genesis does not require us to limit very narrowly\r\ntheir antiquity. The date of the Glacial period is, however, at present\r\nvery uncertain. On the one hand, some geologists, like Lyell, have\r\nsupposed it may be as far back as 200,000 years ago. Others, like Croll,\r\nare contented with the more moderate estimate of 80,000 years. On the\r\nother hand, the calculations of Andrews, based on the recession of the\r\nAmerican lakes, those of Winchell on the recession of the Falls of St.\r\nAnthony, and the recent surveys of the recession of the Falls of\r\nNiagara, reduce the time to from 7,000 to 10,000 years. It is impossible\r\nin the present state of knowledge to settle these disputes; but one may\r\nrefer in the sequel to some of the evidences which have been adduced in\r\nfavour of great antiquity. Since the publication of the second edition\r\nof this work Prof. Prestwich, in a paper read before the Geological\r\nSociety,[90] has brought forward other reasons which induce him to\r\nconclude that the close of the Glacial epoch occurred aEurooefrom 8,000 to\r\n10,000 years since.aEuroŁ It is true, he admits, on geological evidence still\r\nin dispute, that man may have existed in Europe before that time, and he\r\nalso admits, on historical, not geological evidence, the existence of\r\naEurooeNeolithicaEuroŁ man in Asia, aEurooeat an earlier date than 4,000 B.C.aEuroŁ Still the\r\nrepudiation, by so good an authority, of the exaggerated antiquity which\r\nit has been the fashion, since the rise of Darwinian evolution, to\r\nassign to man, contrary to the geological evidence, is a satisfactory\r\nindication of a return to more rational views; and when geologists get\r\nrid of the fiction of a continental ice-sheet, still farther progress\r\nin this direction may be expected.\r\n\r\nWe may, I think, at once take it for granted, that none of the Neocosmic\r\nraces date farther back than the origin of the great eastern nations.\r\nThere are certainly no geological evidences requiring a greater\r\nantiquity, for in their time the land had attained to its present\r\nconfiguration, and the changes which have occurred in the succession of\r\nforests and the growth of peat are such as our experience in America\r\nshows to be possibly quite modern. There is besides no doubt that these\r\npeople, from the Reindeer men of France and Belgium to the people of the\r\nSwiss lakes, are modern races, whose descendants still live in Europe.\r\nWe can thus limit our inquiry to the PalA|ocosmic men; and with respect\r\nto them we know only what may be gathered from a consideration of the\r\nphysical changes which have occurred since they lived.\r\n\r\nIn Europe a great number of considerations have been adduced as evidence\r\nof their high antiquity; and these deserve careful attention, though I\r\nthink it will be found that they are all liable to serious objections or\r\ngreat abatements on geological grounds.\r\n\r\n(1) The occurrence of human remains with those of animals now extinct\r\naffords no certain evidence of antiquity. Admitting that human remains\r\nare found along with those of the mammoth in Europe, and with those of\r\nthe mastodon in America, the question remains, How late did these\r\nspecies survive? In Europe we know that several large animals now\r\nextinct existed up to comparatively modern times. This is the case with\r\nthe Irish deer (_Megaceros_), the urus, the aurochs, and the reindeer,\r\nin temperate Europe. How long previously the mammoth or the hairy\r\nrhinoceros disappeared we do not know, but need not suppose the time\r\nvery long.\r\n\r\n(2) The accumulation of sediment or of stalagmite over human remains in\r\ncaverns is not necessarily indicative of very great antiquity. We know\r\nthat in favourable circumstances mud, sand, and gravel may be rapidly\r\ndeposited in caves by land floods or river inundations, and that\r\n_dA(C)bris_ of various sorts accumulates in such places from decay of rock\r\nand vegetable and animal agencies. The deposition of stalagmite is also\r\nvery variable in its rate; and the fact that it is being very slowly\r\ndeposited in any cave now does not prove that more rapid deposition may\r\nnot have taken place formerly. Dawkins and others have ascertained a\r\nrate of a quarter of an inch per annum in some caverns; and this would\r\nallow the stalagmite crust of KentaEuro(TM)s cave, for which an antiquity of\r\nhalf a million of years has been claimed, to have been formed in a\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 192.aEuro\"Sketch of a Mammoth, carved on a portion of a\r\nTusk of the same Animal (Lartet).]\r\n\r\n(3) The erosion of river valleys to great depths since the Glacial\r\nperiod fails to establish the great antiquity of the caves left on their\r\nsides or the high level gravels of their banks. Throughout the northern\r\nhemisphere, the river valleys are of old date, and were merely filled\r\nwith loose detritus in the Glacial age. The sweeping out of this\r\n_dA(C)bris_ would be a rapid process, more especially when changes of level\r\nwere occurring, and when the rainfall was greater than at present.\r\nBesides, as Croll has well remarked, the actual configuration of our\r\ncontinents, the amount of drift still remaining, and the imperfect\r\nmanner in which the river valleys have been cleared out, all testify to\r\nthe comparative recency of the Glacial period.[91] These considerations\r\nwould, indeed, materially reduce the antiquity which he claims on\r\nastronomical grounds for the ice age.\r\n\r\n(4) The growth of peat and the deposition of silt are very deceptive as\r\nindications of great antiquity. For instance, accurate observations made\r\nby a French engineer in the construction of docks at St. Nazaire,[92]\r\nshow that in 1,600 years the Loire had deposited over Gallo-Roman\r\nremains six metres of mud. Relics of the Bronze age occur below these at\r\na depth indicating 500 years previously as their date; and the beginning\r\nof the modern deposit of the Loire would, on the same evidence, be only\r\n6,000 years ago. HilgardaEuro(TM)s observations on the delta of the Mississippi\r\nin like manner tend greatly to reduce our estimates of the time occupied\r\nin the deposit of the modern silt of that river. The peat deposit at\r\nAbbeville, at the mouth of the Somme, has been supposed to have required\r\n30,000 years for its formation. But this estimate was based upon the\r\npresent rate of growth; and, as Andrews has shown, the fact admitted by\r\nBoucher de Perthes, that birch stems three feet high stand in this peat,\r\nimplies a much more rapid rate, which is also proved by the depth at\r\nwhich Roman remains have been found. In like manner the Scandinavian\r\npeats, to which a fabulous antiquity has been ascribed, have been proved\r\nto be comparatively modern by the depths at which metallic works of art\r\nare found in them.\r\n\r\n(5) The paucity of remains of PalA|ocosmic men in Europe, with their wide\r\ndistribution, indicate that their sojourn was not long, or that the\r\npopulation was very small and much scattered. Even in a few thousands of\r\nyears, an active and vigorous people, living in a country well supplied\r\nwith food, must have multiplied greatly, and must have left considerable\r\nremains. On the theory that these men inhabited Europe even for 2,000\r\nyears, we have to suppose that the greater part of their remains have\r\nbeen swept away, or remain under the waters, or buried out of sight in\r\ndiluvial sediments.\r\n\r\n(6) Much importance has been attached to the early works and high\r\nculture of Egypt and ChaldA|a, as evidence of vast time during which arts\r\nwere growing from a supposed rude stone age. But it must be observed\r\nthat no such period is known to antedate civilisation in the East, and\r\nthat if the early empires were established by survivors of the Deluge,\r\nthey must have brought with them the culture of Antediluvian times.\r\nFarther, the notion of men emerging from a half-brutal state, and from\r\nthe use of the rudest implements, is purely conjectural and not\r\nsupported by facts. In America, where the semi-civilised agricultural\r\nraces are unquestionably the oldest, the rudest possible implements were\r\nused by these partially civilised agricultural people along with\r\npolished stone and metal; and Schliemann has shown that a rude stone age\r\nsucceeded the civilisation of Troy, and this at a time when PhA\"nicia and\r\nEgypt were at the height of their civilisation. Such facts, which might\r\nfill volumes, show how little value is to be attached to supposed ages\r\nof rough and polished stone.\r\n\r\n(7) The difficulties attending the establishment of geological dates for\r\ndeposits like those containing the remains of men are very great. They\r\nare altogether superficial and local, not wide-spread marine beds in\r\nwhich a distinct order of superposition can be clearly traced. They are\r\nnot easily separated from the glacial beds below, or from those above\r\nwhich have been modified by human agency, by land-floods, or by\r\nlandslips. Thus the application of geological criteria of age to them is\r\nvery difficult and uncertain. Evidence of this could easily be given, in\r\nthe many errors which have been promulgated, and which have had to be\r\nretracted by their authors, or have been disproved by the observations\r\nof others. For example, no country was at one time richer in supposed\r\nevidences of the antiquity of man than Scandinavia; but Professor\r\nTorell, the director of the Geological Survey of Sweden, has recently\r\nmade a careful re-examination of the facts, and has found that there is\r\nno evidence whatever of the existence of man in Scandinavia before the\r\nNeolithic or polished stone age. There are, however, evidences of\r\nconsiderable changes of level since that time, and it would seem even\r\nsince the twelfth century of our era. The remarkable and seemingly\r\ninexcusable errors of observation referred to in Professor TorellaEuro(TM)s\r\nmemoir, should enforce a caution on geologists as to the uncertainties\r\nof such evidence. Lyell sifted the testimony bearing on this subject\r\nwith great care in the first edition of his _Antiquity of Man_. In later\r\neditions he had to make large abatements, and now much of the evidence\r\nin the latest edition would have to be withdrawn or otherwise applied.\r\n\r\nFrom all these considerations the conclusion is obvious that while we\r\nhave no certain data for assigning a definite number of years to the\r\nresidence of man on the earth, we have no geological evidence for the\r\nrash assertion often made that in comparison with historical periods the\r\ndate of the earliest races of men recedes into a dim, mysterious, and\r\nmeasureless antiquity. On the basis of that Lyellian principle of the\r\napplication of modern causes to explain past changes, which is the\r\nstable foundation of modern geology, we fail to erect any such edifice\r\nas the indefinite antiquity of man, or to extend this comparatively\r\ninsignificant interval to an equality with the long A|ons of the\r\npreceding Tertiary. The demand for such indefinite extension of the\r\nhistory of man rests not on geological facts, but on the necessities of\r\nhypotheses which, whatever their foundation, have no basis in the\r\ndiscoveries of that science, and are not required to account for the\r\nsequence which it discloses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF THE HISTORY OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat general conclusions can we reach as to this long and strange\r\nhistory of the progress of life on our planet? Perhaps the most\r\ncomprehensive of these is that the links in the chain of life, or rather\r\nin its many chains, are not scattered and disunited things, but members\r\nof a great and complex plan; and that when we discern their combinations\r\nand their pattern, we find them not only orderly and symmetrical, but\r\nall tending to one point and bound to one central object, even the\r\nthrone of the Eternal. It must also appear evident that the original\r\nplan of nature, both in the animal and vegetable worlds, was too vast to\r\nbe realised at one time on a globe so limited as ours, but had to be\r\ndistributed in time as well as in space, thus realising the idea of\r\ntime-worlds: successive A|ons in which, one after the other, the work of\r\ncreation could rise to successive stages of perfection and completeness\r\ntill it culminated in man. All this is sufficiently plain on the\r\ntheistic view of nature, and may suffice for those who reverently regard\r\nthe God of nature as the Father of their own spirits. But there are\r\nothers who ask further questions. Do we know anything of the secondary\r\ncauses and origin of life, of the manner of its introduction and\r\nadvance, of the laws of its succession?\r\n\r\nAs to the first of these questions, it is certain that, up to this time,\r\nthe origination of the living being from the non-living is an\r\ninscrutable mystery. No one has witnessed this change, or has been able\r\nto effect it experimentally. Nor have we any direct evidence of the\r\norigination of one specific type from another. Such reasonings as assume\r\nthe possibility of these things, or on analogical grounds assert their\r\nprobability, belong rather to the domain of philosophical speculation\r\nthan to science. As to the laws of the succession of life, however, it\r\nis possible to learn something from the sequence of facts as already\r\nascertained; and though much remains to be discovered, there are a few\r\nleading statements on this subject which can already be made with\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nUnity and uniformity, within the limits imposed by progress and\r\nincreasing complexity, can be affirmed of the whole process. From the\r\ndawn of life to the present time the great laws of physical nature which\r\noperate on animals and plants have been uniform. These stable laws have\r\nregulated the action of the outer world on organisms. The plans of\r\nstructure of these organisms laid down at the first have been followed\r\nthroughout. Thus the succession of life presents nothing fortuitous or\r\narbitrary, but a continuous plan carried out uniformly in time and\r\nspace, with certain materials of fixed properties, and with certain\r\nstructures predetermined from the first. There is, for example, a great\r\nsameness of plan throughout the whole history of the marine invertebrate\r\nlife of the PalA|ozoic. If we turn over the pages of an illustrated\r\ntext-book of geology, or examine the cases or drawers of a collection of\r\nfossils, we shall find extending through every succeeding formation,\r\nrepresentative forms of Crustaceans, Mollusks, and Corals, in such a\r\nmanner as to indicate that in each successive period there has been a\r\nreproduction of the same type with modifications; and if the series is\r\nnot continuous, this appears to be due to lack of specimens, or to\r\nabrupt physical changes; since sometimes, where two formations pass into\r\neach other, we find a gradual change in the fossils by the dropping out\r\nand introduction of species one by one. Thus in the whole of the great\r\nPalA|ozoic period, both in its fauna and flora, we have a continuity and\r\nsimilarity of a most marked character.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, nothing to preclude the supposition that many forms\r\nreckoned as species are really only race modifications. My own\r\nprovisional conclusion, based on the study of PalA|ozoic plants,\r\npublished many years ago,[93] is that the general law will be found to\r\nbe the existence of distinct specific types independent of each other,\r\nbut liable in geological time to minor modifications, which have often\r\nbeen regarded as distinct species.\r\n\r\nWhile this unity of successive faunA| at first sight presents an\r\nappearance of hereditary succession, it loses much of this character\r\nwhen we consider the number of new types introduced without apparent\r\npredecessors, or ceasing without successors, and the almost changeless\r\npersistence of other types; the necessity that there should be\r\nsimilarity of type in successive faunA| on any hypothesis of a continuous\r\nplan; and, above all, the fact that the recurrence of representative\r\nspecies or races in large proportion marks times of decadence rather\r\nthan of expansion in the types to which they belong. To return to a\r\nlater period, this is very manifest in that singular resemblance which\r\nobtains between the modern mammals of South America and Australia and\r\ntheir immediate fossil predecessorsaEuro\"the phenomenon being here\r\nmanifestly that of decadence of large and abundant species into a few\r\ndepauperated representatives. This will be found to be a very general\r\nlaw, elevation being accompanied by the abrupt appearance of new types,\r\nand decadence by the apparent continuation of old species, or\r\nmodifications of them.\r\n\r\nThis resemblance with difference in successive faunA| also connects\r\nitself very directly with the successive elevations and depressions of\r\nour continental plateaus in geological time.\r\n\r\nEvery great PalA|ozoic limestone, for example, indicates a depression\r\nwith succeeding elevation. On each elevation marine animals were driven\r\nback into the ocean, and on each depression swarmed in over the land,\r\nreinforced by new species, either then introduced or derived by\r\nmigration from other localities. In like manner on every depression,\r\nland plants and animals were driven in upon insular areas, and on\r\nre-elevation again spread themselves widely. Now I think it will be\r\nfound to be a law here that periods of expansion were eminently those of\r\nintroduction of new specific types, and periods of contraction those of\r\nextinction, and also of continuance of old types under new varietal\r\nforms. It must also be borne in mind that all the leading types of\r\ninvertebrate life were early introduced, that change within these was\r\nnecessarily limited, and that elevation could take place mainly by the\r\nintroduction of the vertebrate orders. So in plants, Cryptogams early\r\nattained their maximum as well as Gymnosperms, and elevation occurred in\r\nthe introduction of PhA|nogams.\r\n\r\nAnother allied fact is the simultaneous appearance of like types of life\r\nin one and the same geological period, over widely separated regions of\r\nthe earthaEuro(TM)s surface. This strikes us especially in the comparatively\r\nsimple and homogeneous life-dynasties of the PalA|ozoic, when for example\r\nwe find the same types of Silurian Graptolites, Trilobites and\r\nBrachiopods appearing simultaneously in Australia, America, and Europe.\r\nPerhaps in no department is it more impressive than in the introduction\r\nin the Devonian and Carboniferous ages of that grand cryptogamous and\r\ngymnospermous flora which ranges from Brazil to Spitzbergen, and from\r\nAustralia to Scotland, accompanied in all by the same groups of marine\r\ninvertebrates; or in the like wholesale production of modern types of\r\ntrees in the Cretaceous. Such facts may depend either on that long life\r\nof specific types which gives them ample time to spread to all possible\r\nhabitats, before their extinction; or on some general law whereby the\r\nconditions suitable to similar types of life emerge at one time in all\r\nparts of the world. Both causes may be influential, as the one does not\r\nexclude the other, and there is reason to believe that both are natural\r\nfacts. Should it be ultimately proved that species allied and\r\nrepresentative, but distinct in origin, come into being simultaneously\r\neverywhere, we shall arrive at one of the laws of creation, and one\r\nprobably connected with the gradual change of the physical conditions of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nA closely related truth is the periodicity of introduction of species.\r\nThey come in by bursts or flood-tides at particular points of time,\r\nwhile these great life-waves are followed and preceded by times of ebb\r\nin which little that is new is being produced. We labour in our\r\ninvestigation of this matter under the disadvantage that the modern\r\nperiod is evidently one of the times of pause in the creative work. Had\r\nour time been that of the early Tertiary or early Mesozoic, our views as\r\nto the question of origin of species might have been very different. It\r\nis a striking fact, in illustration of this, that since the Glacial age\r\nno new species of mammal can be proved to have originated on our\r\ncontinents, while a great number of large and conspicuous forms have\r\ndisappeared. It is possible that the proximate or secondary causes of\r\nthe ebb and flow of life-production may be in part at least physical;\r\nbut other and more important efficient causes may be behind these. In\r\nany case these undulations in the history of life are in harmony with\r\nmuch that we see in other departments of nature.\r\n\r\nIt results from the above and the immediately preceding statement that\r\nspecific and generic types enter on the stage in great force, and\r\ngradually taper off toward extinction. They should so appear in the\r\ngeological diagrams made to illustrate the succession of life. This\r\napplies even to those forms of life which come in with fewest species\r\nand under the most humble guise. What a remarkable swarming, for\r\nexample, there must have been of Marsupial Mammals in the early\r\nMesozoic; and in the Coal formation the only known Pulmonates, four or\r\nfive in number, belong to as many generic types.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the permanence of certain species in\r\ngeological time. I may now place this in connection with the law of\r\norigination and more or less continuous transmission of varietal forms.\r\nI may, perhaps, best illustrate this in connection with a group of\r\nspecies with which I am very familiar, that which came into our seas at\r\nthe beginning of the Glacial age, and still exists. With regard to their\r\npermanence, it can be affirmed that the shells now elevated in Wales to\r\n1,200 and in Canada to 600 feet above the sea, and which lived before\r\nthe last great revolution of our continents, a period vastly remote as\r\ncompared with human history, differ in no tittle from their modern\r\nsuccessors after thousands or tens of thousands of generations. It can\r\nalso be affirmed that the more variable species appear under precisely\r\nthe same varietal forms then as now, though these varieties have changed\r\nmuch in their local distribution. The real import of these statements,\r\nwhich might also be made with regard to other groups well known to\r\npalA|ontologists, is of so great significance that it can be realised\r\nonly after we have thought of the vast time and numerous changes through\r\nwhich these humble creatures have survived. I may call in evidence here\r\na familiar British and American animal, the common sand clam, _Mya\r\narenaria_, and its relative, _Mya truncata_, which now inhabit together\r\nall the northern seas; for the Pacific specimens, from Japan and\r\nCalifornia, though differently named, are undoubtedly the same. _Mya\r\ntruncata_ appears in Europe in the older Pliocene, and was followed by\r\n_M. arenaria_ a little later. Both shells occur in the Pleistocene of\r\nAmerica, and their several varietal forms had then already developed\r\nthemselves, and remain the same to-day; so that these humble mollusks,\r\nlittoral in their habits, and subjected to a great variety of\r\nconditions, have continued, perhaps for one or two thousand centuries,\r\nto construct their shells precisely as at present. Nor are there any\r\nindications of a transition between the two species. Similar statements\r\nmay be made with regard to other mollusks of the Pliocene and Modern\r\nperiods, and there are even species which extend unchanged from the\r\nearly Eocene. Nor is it impossible that some modern bivalves of the\r\nBrachiopod group may be scarcely modified descendants even of PalA|ozoic\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of the most remarkable facts in connection with the\r\npermanence of species and varietal forms are those furnished by that\r\nmagnificent flora which burst in all its majesty on the American\r\ncontinent in the Cretaceous period, and still survives among us even in\r\nsome of its specific types, I say survives; for we have but a remnant of\r\nits forms living, and comparatively little that is new has probably been\r\nadded since. Take, for example, the facts stated in Chapter VIII. as to\r\nthe continuance to the present time of species of plants introduced in\r\nthe Cretaceous and Eocene, and which thus came in at the very time when\r\nthe great Mesozoic reptiles were decaying or had just disappeared, and\r\nwhen the placental mammals were being introduced. Some of these plants\r\nmust have propagated themselves unchanged for half a million of years.\r\n\r\nPlants and the lower tribes of animals are, however, more permanent than\r\nthe higher animals; and a strange contrast is afforded to the foregoing\r\nexamples of persistence by the repeated revolutions that have affected\r\nvertebrate life since the Mesozoic age. Yet even in the case of\r\nvertebrates there seems to have been little change, except in the\r\nextinction of species, since the Pliocene period.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion of this review, can we formulate a few of the general\r\nlaws, or perhaps I had better call them the general conclusions\r\nrespecting life, in which all palA|ontologists may agree? Perhaps it is\r\nnot possible to do this at present satisfactorily, but the attempt may\r\ndo no harm. We may, then, I think, make the following affirmations:aEuro\"\r\n\r\n(1) The existence of life and organisation on the earth is not eternal,\r\nor even coeval with the beginning of the physical universe, but may\r\npossibly date from Laurentian or immediately pre-Laurentian times.\r\n\r\n(2) The introduction of new species of animals and plants has been a\r\ncontinuous process, not necessarily in the sense of derivation of one\r\nspecies from another, but in the higher sense of the continued operation\r\nof the cause or causes which introduced life at first. This, as already\r\nstated, I take to be the true theological or Scriptural as well as\r\nscientific idea of what we ordinarily and somewhat loosely term\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n(3) Though thus continuous, the process has not been uniform; but\r\nperiods of rapid production of species have alternated with others in\r\nwhich many disappeared and few were introduced. This may have been an\r\neffect of physical cycles reacting on the progress of life.\r\n\r\n(4) Species, like individuals, have greater energy and vitality in their\r\nyounger stages, and rapidly assume all their varietal forms, and extend\r\nthemselves as widely as external circumstances will permit. Like\r\nindividuals, also, they have their periods of old age and decay, though\r\nthe life of some species has been of enormous duration in comparison\r\nwith that of others; the difference appearing to be connected with\r\ndegrees of adaptation to different conditions of life.\r\n\r\n(5) Many allied species, constituting groups of animals and plants, have\r\nmade their appearance at once in various parts of the earth, and these\r\ngroups have obeyed the same laws with the individual and the species in\r\nculminating rapidly, and then slowly diminishing, though a large group\r\nonce introduced has rarely disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\n(6) Groups of species, as genera and orders, do not usually begin with\r\ntheir highest or lowest forms, but with intermediate and generalised\r\ntypes, and they show a capacity for both elevation and degradation in\r\ntheir subsequent history.\r\n\r\n(7) The history of life presents a progress from the lower to the\r\nhigher, and from the simpler to the more complex, and from the more\r\ngeneralised to the more specialised. In this progress new types are\r\nintroduced, and take the place of the older ones, which sink to a\r\nrelatively subordinate place, and become thus degraded. But the physical\r\nand organic changes have been so correlated and adjusted that life has\r\nnot only always maintained its existence, but has been enabled to assume\r\nmore complex forms, and that older forms have been made to prepare the\r\nway for newer, so that there has been on the whole a steady elevation\r\nculminating in man himself. Elevation and specialisation have, however,\r\nbeen secured at the expense of vital energy and range of adaptation,\r\nuntil the new element of a rational and inventive nature was introduced\r\nin the case of man.\r\n\r\n(8) In regard to the larger and more distinct types, we cannot find\r\nevidence that they have, in their introduction, been preceded by similar\r\nforms connecting them with previous groups; but there is reason to\r\nbelieve that many supposed representative species in successive\r\nformations are really only races or varieties.\r\n\r\n(9) In so far as we can trace their history, specific types are\r\npermanent in their characters from their introduction to their\r\nextinction, and their earlier varietal forms are similar to their later\r\nones.\r\n\r\n(10) PalA|ontology furnishes no direct evidence, perhaps never can\r\nfurnish any, as to the actual transformation of one species into\r\nanother, or as to the actual circumstances of creation of a species, but\r\nthe drift of its testimony is to show that species come in _per saltum_,\r\nrather than by any slow and gradual process.\r\n\r\n(11) The origin and history of life cannot, any more than the origin and\r\ndetermination of matter and force, be explained on purely material\r\ngrounds, but involve the consideration of power referable to the unseen\r\nand spiritual world.\r\n\r\nDifferent minds may state these principles in different ways, but I\r\nbelieve that in so far as palA|ontology is concerned, in substance they\r\nmust hold good, at least as steps to higher truths. And now I may be\r\npermitted to add that we should be thankful that it is given to us to\r\ndeal with so great questions, and that in doing so deep humility,\r\nearnest seeking for truth, patient collection of all facts, self-denying\r\nabstinence from hasty generalisations, forbearance and generous\r\nestimation with regard to our fellow-labourers, and reliance on that\r\nDivine Spirit which has breathed into us our intelligent life, and is\r\nthe source of all true wisdom, are the qualities which best become us.\r\n\r\nAs we have traced onward the succession of life, reference has been made\r\nhere and there to the defects of those bold theories of descent with\r\nmodification which are held forth in our time as the true bond of the\r\nlinks of the chain of life. It must have been apparent that these\r\ntheories, however specious when placed in connection with a limited\r\ninduction of facts selected for the purpose of illustrating them, are\r\nvery far from affording a satisfactory solution of all difficulties.\r\nThey cannot perhaps be expected to take us back to the origin of living\r\nbeings; but they also fail to explain why so vast numbers of highly\r\norganised species struggle into existence simultaneously in one age and\r\ndisappear in another, why no continuous chain of succession in time can\r\nbe found gradually blending species into each other, and why in the\r\nnatural succession of things degradation under the influence of external\r\nconditions and final extinction seem to be laws of organic existence. It\r\nis useless here to appeal to the imperfection of the record or to the\r\nmovements or migrations of species. The record is now in many important\r\nparts too complete, and the simultaneousness of the entrance of the\r\nfaunas and floras too certainly established, while the moving of species\r\nfrom place to place only evades the difficulty. The truth is that such\r\nhypotheses are at present premature, and that we require to have larger\r\ncollections of facts. Independently of this, however, it would seem that\r\nfrom a philosophical point of view all theories of evolution, as at\r\npresent applied to life, are fundamentally defective in being too\r\npartial in their character; and this applies more particularly to those\r\nwhich are aEurooemonsticaEuroŁ or aEurooeagnostic,aEuroŁ and thus endeavour to dispense with a\r\nCreative Will behind nature. It may be instructive to illustrate from\r\nthe facts developed in preceding chapters this feature of most of the\r\nattempts at generalisation on this subject.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, these hypotheses are too partial, in their tendency to\r\nrefer numerous and complex phenomena to one cause, or to a few causes\r\nonly, when all trustworthy analogy would indicate that they must result\r\nfrom many concurrent forces and determinations of force. We have of late\r\nbeen very familiar with those ingenious, not to say amusing,\r\nspeculations in which some entomologists and botanists have indulged\r\nwith reference to the mutual relations of flowers and haustellate\r\ninsects. Geologically the facts oblige us to begin with Cryptogamous\r\nplants and mandibulate insects; and out of the desire of insects for\r\nnon-existent honey, and the adaptations of plants to the requirements of\r\nnon-existent suctorial apparatus, we have to evolve the marvellous\r\ncomplexity of floral form and colouring, and the exquisitely delicate\r\napparatus of the mouths of haustellate insects. Now when it is borne in\r\nmind that this theory implies a mental confusion on our part precisely\r\nsimilar to that which in the department of mechanics actuates the\r\nseekers for perpetual motion, that we have not the smallest tittle of\r\nevidence that the changes required have actually occurred in any one\r\ncase, and that the thousands of other structures and relations of the\r\nplant and the insect have to be worked out by a series of concurrent\r\nevolutions so complex and absolutely incalculable in the aggregate that\r\nthe cycles and epicycles of the Ptolemaic astronomy were childaEuro(TM)s play in\r\ncomparison, we need not wonder that the common sense of mankind revolts\r\nagainst such fancies, and that we are accused of attempting to construct\r\nthe universe by methods that would baffle Omnipotence itself, because\r\nthey are simply absurd. In this aspect of them, indeed, such\r\nspeculations are necessarily futile, because no mind can grasp all the\r\ncomplexities of even any one case, and it is useless to follow out an\r\nimaginary line of development which unexplained facts must contradict at\r\nevery step. This is also no doubt the reason why all recent attempts at\r\nconstructing aEurooePhylogeniesaEuroŁ are so changeable, and why no two experts can\r\nagree about almost any of them.\r\n\r\nA second aspect in which such speculations are too partial is in the\r\nunwarranted use which they make of analogy. It is not unusual to find\r\nsuch analogies as that between the embryonic development of the\r\nindividual animal and the succession of animals in geological time\r\nplaced on a level with that reasoning from analogy by which geologists\r\napply modern causes to explain geological formations. No claim could be\r\nmore unfounded. When the geologist studies ancient limestones built up\r\nof the remains of corals, and then applies the phenomena of modern coral\r\nreefs to explain their origin, he brings the latter to bear on the\r\nformer by an analogy which includes not merely the apparent results but\r\nthe causes at work, and the conditions of their action; and it is on\r\nthis that the validity of his comparison depends, in so far as it\r\nrelates to similarity of mode of formation. But when we compare the\r\ndevelopment of an animal from an embryo cell with the progress of\r\nanimals in time, though we have a curious analogy as to the steps of the\r\nprocess, the conditions and agents at work are known to be altogether\r\ndissimilar, and therefore we have no evidence whatever as to identity of\r\ncause, and our reasoning becomes at once the most transparent of\r\nfallacies. Farther, we have no right here to overlook the fact that the\r\nconditions of the embryo are determined by those of a previous adult,\r\nand that no sooner does this hereditary potentiality produce a new adult\r\nanimal than the terrible external agencies of the physical world, in\r\npresence of which all life exists, begin to tell on the organism, and\r\nafter a struggle of longer or shorter duration it succumbs to death, and\r\nits substance returns into inorganic nature, a law from which even the\r\nlonger life of the species does not seem to exempt it. All this is so\r\nplain and manifest that it is extraordinary that evolutionists will\r\ncontinue to use such partial and imperfect arguments. Another example\r\nmay be taken from that application of the doctrine of natural selection\r\nto explain the introduction of species in geological time which is so\r\nelaborately discussed by Sir C. Lyell in the last edition of his\r\n_Principles of Geology_. The great geologist evidently leans strongly to\r\nthe theory, and claims for it the aEurooehighest degree of probability,aEuroŁ yet\r\nhe perceives that there is a serious gap in it; since no modern fact has\r\never proved the origin of a new species by modification. Such a gap, if\r\nit existed in those grand analogies by which we explain geological\r\nformations through modern causes, would be admitted to be fatal.\r\n\r\nA third illustration of the partial character of these hypotheses may be\r\ntaken from the use made of the theory deduced from modern physical\r\ndiscoveries, that life must be merely a product of the continuous\r\noperation of physical laws. The assumption, for it is nothing more, that\r\nthe phenomena of life are produced merely by some arrangement of\r\nphysical forces, even if it be admitted to be true, gives only a partial\r\nexplanation of the possible origin of life. It does not account for the\r\nfact that life as a force or combination of forces is set in antagonism\r\nto all other forces. It does not account for the marvellous connection\r\nof life with organisation. It does not account for the determination and\r\narrangement of forces implied in life. A very simple illustration may\r\nmake this plain. If the problem to be solved were the origin of the\r\nmarineraEuro(TM)s compass, one might assert that it is wholly a physical\r\narrangement both as to matter and force. Another might assert that it\r\ninvolves mind and intelligence in addition. In some sense both would be\r\nright. The properties of magnetic force and of iron or steel are purely\r\nphysical, and it might even be within the bounds of possibility that\r\nsomewhere in the universe a mass of natural loadstone may have been so\r\nbalanced as to swing in harmony with the earthaEuro(TM)s magnetism. Yet we\r\nshould surely be regarded as very credulous if we could be induced to\r\nbelieve that the marineraEuro(TM)s compass has originated in that way. This\r\nargument applies with a thousandfold greater force to the origin of\r\nlife, which involves even in its simplest forms so many more adjustments\r\nof force and so much more complex machinery.\r\n\r\nFourthly, these hypotheses are partial, inasmuch as they fail to account\r\nfor the vastly varied and correlated interdependencies of natural things\r\nand forces, and for the unity of plan which pervades the whole. These\r\ncan be explained only by taking into the account another element from\r\nwithout. Even when it professes to admit the existence of a God, the\r\nevolutionist reasoning of our day limits itself practically to the\r\nphysical or visible universe, and leaves entirely out of sight the power\r\nof the unseen and spiritual, as if this were something with which\r\nscience has nothing to do, but which belongs only to imagination or\r\nsentiment. So much has this been the case that when recently a few\r\nphysicists and naturalists have turned to this aspect of the subject,\r\nthey have seemed to be teaching new and startling truths, though only\r\nreviving some of the oldest and most permanent ideas of our race. From\r\nthe dawn of human thought it has been the conclusion alike of\r\nphilosophers, theologians, and the common sense of mankind, that the\r\nseen can be explained only by reference to the unseen, and that any\r\nmerely physical theory of the world is necessarily partial. This, too,\r\nis the position of our sacred Scriptures, and is broadly stated in their\r\nopening verse; and indeed it lies alike at the basis of all true\r\nreligion and all sound philosophy, for it must necessarily be that aEurooethe\r\nthings that are seen are temporal, the things that are unseen, eternal.aEuroŁ\r\nWith reference to the primal aggregation of energy in the visible\r\nuniverse, with reference to the introduction of life, with reference to\r\nthe soul of man, with reference to the heavenly gifts of genius and\r\nprophecy, with reference to the introduction of the Saviour Himself into\r\nthe world, and with reference to the spiritual gifts and graces of GodaEuro(TM)s\r\npeople, all these spring not from sporadic acts of intervention, but\r\nfrom the continuous action of God and the unseen world; and this, we\r\nmust never forget, is the true ideal of creation in Scripture and in\r\nsound theology. Only in such exceptional and little influential\r\nphilosophies as that of Democritus, and in the speculations of a few men\r\ncarried off their balance by the brilliant physical discoveries of our\r\nage, has this necessarily partial and imperfect view been adopted. Never\r\nindeed was its imperfection more clear than in the light of modern\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nGeology, by tracing back all present things to their origin, was the\r\nfirst science to establish on a basis of observed facts the necessity of\r\na beginning and end of the world. But even physical science now teaches\r\nus that the visible universe is a vast machine for the dissipation of\r\nenergy; that the processes going on in it must have had a beginning in\r\ntime, and that all things tend to a final and helpless equilibrium. This\r\nnecessity implies an unseen power, an invisible universe, in which the\r\nvisible universe must have originated, and to which its energy is ever\r\nreturning. The hiatus between the seen and the unseen may be bridged\r\nover by the conceptions of atomic vortices of force, and by the\r\nuniversal and continuous ether; but whether or not, it has become clear\r\nthat the conception of the unseen as existing has become necessary to\r\nour belief in the possible existence of the physical universe itself,\r\neven without taking life into the account.\r\n\r\nIt is in the domain of life, however, that this necessity becomes most\r\napparent; and it is in the plant that we first clearly perceive a\r\nvisible testimony to that unseen which is the counterpart of the seen.\r\nLife in the plant opposes the outward rush of force in our system,\r\narrests a part of it on its way, fixes it as potential energy, and\r\nthus, forming a mere eddy, so to speak, in the process of dissipation of\r\nenergy, it accumulates that on which animal life and man himself may\r\nsubsist, and assert for a time supremacy over the seen and temporal on\r\nbehalf of the unseen and eternal. I say, for a time, because life is, in\r\nthe visible universe, as at present constituted, but a temporary\r\nexception, introduced from that unseen world where it is no longer the\r\nexception but the eternal rule. In a still higher sense, then, than that\r\nin which matter and force testify to a Creator, organisation and life,\r\nwhether in the plant, the animal, or man, bear the same testimony, and\r\nexist as outposts put forth in the succession of ages from that higher\r\nheaven that surrounds the visible universe. In them, as in dead matter,\r\nAlmighty power is no doubt conditioned by law, yet they bear more\r\ndistinctly upon them the impress of their Maker, and while all\r\nexplanations of the physical universe which refuse to recognise its\r\nspiritual and unseen origin must necessarily be partial and in the end\r\nincomprehensible, this destiny falls more quickly and surely on the\r\nattempt to account for life and its succession on merely materialistic\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nHere, however, we must remember that creation, as maintained against\r\nsuch materialistic evolution, whether by theology, philosophy, or Holy\r\nScripture, is necessarily a continuous, nay, an eternal influence, not\r\nan intervention of disconnected acts. It is the true continuity, which\r\nincludes and binds together all other continuity.\r\n\r\nIt is here that natural science meets with theology, not as an\r\nantagonist, but as a friend and ally in its time of greatest need; and I\r\nmust here record my belief that neither men of science nor theologians\r\nhave a right to separate what God in Holy Scripture has joined together,\r\nor to build up a wall between nature and religion, and write upon it aEurooeno\r\nthoroughfare.aEuroŁ The science that does this must be impotent to explain\r\nnature and without hold on the higher sentiments of man. The theology\r\nthat does this must sink into mere superstition.\r\n\r\nIn the light of all these considerations, whether bearing on our\r\nknowledge or our ignorance, a higher and deeper question presents\r\nitself, namely, that as to the relation of nature and of man to a\r\nPersonal Creator. To this it seems to me that the study of the\r\nsuccession of life yields no uncertain reply. Call the progress of life\r\nan evolution if you will; trace it back to primA|val Protozoa, or to a\r\ncongeries of atoms: still the truth remains that nothing can be evolved\r\nout of these primitive materials except what they originally contained.\r\nNow we find in the existence of man, and in the tendency of the scheme\r\nof nature towards his introduction, evidence that at least all that is\r\ninvolved in the reasoning and moral nature of man must have existed\r\npotentially before atoms began to shape themselves into crystals or into\r\norganic forms. Nay, more than this is implied, for we do not know that\r\nman and what he has hitherto been and done constitute the ultimate\r\nperfection of nature, and we must suspect that something much more than\r\nwhat we see in man must be required for the origination of the chain of\r\nlife. What does this prove, in any sense in which human reason can\r\nunderstand it? Nothing less, it seems to me, than that doctrine of the\r\nAlmighty Divine Logos, or Creative Reason, as the cause of all things,\r\nasserted in our sacred Scriptures, and held in one form or another by\r\nall the greatest thinkers who have attempted to deal with the question\r\nof origins. Falling back on this great truth, whether presented to us in\r\nthe simple aEurooeGod saidaEuroŁ of Genesis, or in the more definite form of the\r\nNew Testament, aEurooeThe Word was with God, and the Word was God,aEuroŁ we find\r\nourselves in the presence of a Divine plan pervading all the ages of the\r\nearthaEuro(TM)s history and culminating in man, who presents for the first time\r\nthe image and likeness of the Divine Maker; and this forms the true\r\nnexus of all the separate chains of life. Had man never existed, such\r\nreasoning might have been speculative merely, but the existence of man,\r\ntaken in connection with the progress of the plan which has terminated\r\nin his advent, proves the existence of God.\r\n\r\nDivine revelation carries us a step farther, and teaches us to recognise\r\nin Jesus of Nazareth God manifest in the flesh, the Divine Logos\r\ndwelling among men. But though this is a doctrine of revelation and not\r\nof science, it is in perfect harmony with the plan of progress which we\r\nhave been sketching. It is the natural outcome of a process leading to\r\nthe introduction of a rational and accountable being, understanding\r\nsomething of the works and ways of God, that to him God should reveal\r\nHimself, and that the Divine Logos, by whom were aEurooeconstituted the\r\nagesaEuroŁ[94] of the worldaEuro(TM)s geological history, should preside also over\r\nits future consummation, when all the degradation that has sprung from\r\nthe aberrations of fallen and imperfect humanity shall be removed, and\r\nman himself shall become fully a partaker of the Divine nature.\r\n\r\nThe world we live in is thus not necessarily a finished world, and it is\r\nnow marred by the sins of man. What it may be in the future, we can\r\nperhaps as little guess as an intelligence studying the PalA|ozoic world\r\ncould have understood that of the present time. But it is a glorious\r\ntruth to know that our Maker has revealed Himself to us also as a\r\nSaviour, and that as individuals we shall not perish, to be replaced by\r\nan improved species in the future, but that we ourselves, as sons of\r\nGod, may enter into and possess the new earth and new heavens of future\r\nA|ons of the universe. Thus it would seem that the Gospel of Jesus Christ\r\nis that which was wanting to complete and justify the history of nature\r\nby bringing to light the final aEurooerestitution of all things,aEuroŁ and our own\r\nunion to God in a happy immortality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Croll has elaborated this calculation in his work, _Climate and\r\nTime_.\r\n\r\n[2] Sept. 1879.\r\n\r\n[3] Analyses recently made by Mr. C.

Hinde has described Conodonts from the Silurian of\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n[36] _Ueber Conodonten_: Munich, 1886.\r\n\r\n[37] _Lepidosteus._\r\n\r\n[38] _PalA|ichthyes_ of GA1/4nther.\r\n\r\n[39] _Dinichthys Terrelli_ and _D.

I have provisionally named the St. John species\r\n_Strophites erianus_.\r\n\r\n[44] The enlarged figure of _Pupa vetusta_ is too much elongated, and\r\nthe aperture is somewhat conjectural, as it is usually crushed.\r\n\r\n[45] _Dawsonella_ of Bradley.\r\n\r\n[46] _ArchiulidA|_ of Scudder.\r\n\r\n[47] _Euphobesia armigera_ (Meek and Worthen), from Illinois.\r\n\r\n[48] About fifty in all, as I learn from Mr. Scudder.\r\n\r\n[49] _Orthoptera._\r\n\r\n[50] _Neuroptera._\r\n\r\n[51] _Coleoptera._\r\n\r\n[52] _TincA|._\r\n\r\n[53] One highly specialised Carboniferous insect recently found is the\r\n_Protophasma_ of Brongniart, a relative of the modern aEurooeWalking-sticks.aEuroŁ\r\n\r\n[54] This was first described as part of the larva of a Dragon-fly. It\r\nis now recognised as belonging to a Scorpion.\r\n\r\n[55] _Protolycosa_ (Roemer).\r\n\r\n[56] _Menopoma_, _Menobranchus_, &c.\r\n\r\n[57] _Ophiderpeton Brownriggii._\r\n\r\n[58] _Diplichnites._\r\n\r\n[59] These are known in some of the smaller species, but not as yet in\r\nthe larger.\r\n\r\n[60] _Hylonomus._ See Fig. facing this chapter.\r\n\r\n[61] _Mastodonsaurus_ or _Labyrinthodon_.\r\n\r\n[62] _PalA|osiren Beinertii_ of Geinitz.\r\n\r\n[63] _Hyleopeton._\r\n\r\n[64] _Diadictes_ and _Bolasaurus_ (Cope).\r\n\r\n[65] _Enaliosauria_, including _Ichthyopterygia_ and _Sauropterygia_.\r\n\r\n[66] _Anomodontia_ and _Theriodontia_.\r\n\r\n[67] _Geology of Oxford_, p. 227.\r\n\r\n[68] Cope has proposed the names _Camerosaurus_, _AmphicA\"lias_, &c., for\r\nthese problematical animals. Marsh names them _Titanosaurus_,\r\n_Atlantosaurus_, &c., while Owen holds that some of them at least are\r\nidentical with his genus _Chondrosteosaurus_. Seeley and Hulke adopt the\r\nname _Ornithopsis_, and support CopeaEuro(TM)s view of their nature.\r\n\r\n[69] _RatitA|._\r\n\r\n[70] Woodward in a recent paper refers to a still more curious\r\nresemblance of the Dinosaurs to the biped lizard of Australia\r\n(_Chlamydosaurus_), which runs on its hind limbs, and even perches on\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n[71] A poplar occurs in Greenland, in beds held to be Lower Cretaceous.\r\n\r\n[72] By some regarded as Upper Cretaceous.\r\n\r\n[73] First recognized in American Eocene by Newberry.\r\n\r\n[74] Described by La Harpe and Gaudin, and recently by Gardner.\r\n\r\n[75] Recent discoveries have since the publication of the first edition\r\nremoved the Bovey Tracey beds from the Miocene to the Eocene.

Dawson, _Report on 49th Parallel_; _Reports on British\r\nColumbia_.\r\n\r\n[78] GrayaEuro(TM)s reasoning is based on the extreme view of the Glacial period\r\nnow prevalent in America, contrary, as it appears to me, to the actual\r\nfacts; but with limitations it holds good on more moderate views as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n[79] _Geological Magazine_, July, 1887.\r\n\r\n[80] _Les Enchainements du Monde Animal._\r\n\r\n[81] See Frontispiece to this Chapter.\r\n\r\n[82] For example, _Tillotherium_ of the American Eocene, which was as\r\nlarge as a tapir, and in form resembled a bear.\r\n\r\n[83] Croll, _Climate and Time_.\r\n\r\n[84] Notes on Post-Pliocene of Canada; _Acadian Geology_, 3rd edition.\r\n\r\n[85] The actual reason for belief in the past existence of land in the\r\nbasin of the Indian Ocean is found in the close relationship of forms of\r\nlife found in Madagascar, Southern Asia, and Australia.\r\n\r\n[86] Traditions of this animal, a veritable primA|val unicorn, are said\r\nstill to exist in Siberia.\r\n\r\n[87] As, for instance, those of Cro-Magnon, and Mentone, and Engis.\r\n\r\n[88] De Puyot and Lohert, Namur, 1887.\r\n\r\n[89] Religious Tract Society,
