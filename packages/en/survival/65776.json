It illustrates the plant\r\nfossils most commonly found in Illinois and relates them to the plants\r\nof which they were a part. A list of publications that will furnish more\r\ndetailed identification of specimens is included. The book has been\r\nprepared in response to numerous inquiries to the Illinois State\r\nGeological Survey from amateur collectors.\r\n\r\nInformation has been drawn from numerous sources. The works of Hirmer,\r\nJanssen, Lesquereux, Noé, and Langford have been particularly useful.\r\n\r\nWe are especially indebted to Dr. Robert M.

The unusual\r\nabundance and preservation of these fossils in the northern part of the\r\nstate have brought collectors to Illinois from many countries, and\r\nprized specimens from that area may be seen in science museums\r\nthroughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable fossils represent plants that lived during the geologic\r\nperiod called the Pennsylvanian or Coal Age and are the result of\r\nspecial geologic conditions that occurred repeatedly during the period.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Pennsylvanian Period, Illinois was part of a\r\nvast lowland that stretched for hundreds of miles to the north, south,\r\nand west, and was bordered on the east by highlands. At times much of\r\nthe plain was swampy and, because the climate was relatively warm and\r\nmoist, great jungles of fast growing trees, shrubs, and vines covered\r\nthe landscape. As successive generations of plants lived and died, plant\r\nmaterial fell into the swamp waters and, protected there from decay,\r\naccumulated.\r\n\r\nFrequently during the period, seas spread over the swampy lowlands,\r\nsubmerging the forests and covering them with mud. Each submergence\r\nlasted only a short time, geologically speaking. When the seas withdrew,\r\nthe deposits of sand and mud left behind were cut by streams that\r\ncarried fresh sand and mud from the eastern highlands. The streams\r\neventually became clogged with sediments and when the lowland was again\r\ndepressed swamp conditions returned and forests grew afresh. Such a\r\ncycle of deposition was repeated again and again during Pennsylvanian\r\ntime, and after burial each layer of plant material gradually lost most\r\nof its liquids and gases and was slowly converted into one of the\r\nnumerous coal beds presently found in Illinois.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Reconstruction of Pennsylvanian Coal-forming Swamp]\r\n\r\nIn some places in the state conditions existed that were especially\r\nfavorable for preservation of plants, and there delicately preserved\r\nfossils are found in great numbers. In the most favorable areas, such as\r\nin northern Illinois, the plants are preserved in stony nodules called\r\nconcretions, but they also may be found separately as molds, casts, or\r\npetrifactions.\r\n\r\nMolds (concave surfaces) and casts (convex surfaces) are fossilization\r\nphenomena in which the actual plant, embedded in the surrounding\r\nbackground rock, was dissolved, leaving a hollow space (mold) that\r\nsubsequently filled with other material. A cast was thus formed that\r\npreserved the plant’s external features.\r\n\r\nMost petrifactions are fossils in which silica, carbonate, or other\r\nmaterial permeated or replaced the internal structures of the plant and\r\npreserved them so well that in most specimens the finest cellular\r\ndetails can be observed. Compressions, another kind of petrifaction, are\r\nthe pressed carbonized remains of the plant itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PENNSYLVANIAN FLORA\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Aphthoroblattina_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Teneopteron_]\r\n\r\nThe far-reaching Pennsylvanian swamplands had abundant species of trees\r\nand other plants that long since have become extinct. Today’s common\r\ndeciduous trees were not present; flowering plants had not yet evolved.\r\nInstead, the tangled forests were dominated by giant ancestors of\r\npresently existing club-mosses, horsetails, ferns, conifers, and cycads.\r\nThe undergrowth also was well developed, consisting mainly of ferns,\r\nfernlike plants, _Sphenophyllum_, and small club-mosses. The plant\r\nfossils give no indication of seasonal variations. The forests,\r\nevidently always green, grew rapidly and abundantly, with foliage of\r\nunprecedented size and luxuriance. Land animals were just beginning to\r\ndevelop and included sluggish, salamander-like amphibians, large\r\nprimitive insects, and a few small reptiles. The insects flourished as\r\nnever before or since in the damp forests and attained remarkable size.\r\nInsects more than four inches long were common and some are known to\r\nhave been more than a foot long with a wingspread proportionately broad.\r\nAncestors of the modern spiders, scorpions, centipedes (one fossil found\r\nin Illinois was twelve inches long), cockroaches, and dragonflies are\r\nrepresented by several hundred species.\r\n\r\nThe fossilized plants of Pennsylvanian time belonged to only a few main\r\ncategories: scale and seal trees, ancient scouring rushes (horsetails),\r\nherbaceous _Sphenophyllum_, ferns, seed ferns, and cordaitean trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SCALE AND SEAL TREES\r\n                               (Plate 1)\r\n\r\n\r\nScale and seal trees were abundant during the Pennsylvanian Period and\r\nwere important contributors to coal beds. Although distantly related to\r\nthe diminutive club-mosses and ground pines of the present, the trees\r\ngrew on straight, slender trunks to heights of more than a hundred feet.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Reconstruction of _Lepidodendron_\r\n    (after Hirmer)]\r\n\r\nScale trees were so called because their numerous, closely set, spirally\r\narranged leaves left scarred “cushions” on the branches and trunk,\r\nmaking them appear scaly. Seal trees derived their name from the\r\nsignetlike appearance of their leaf cushions. The two best known types\r\nbelong to the genera _Lepidodendron_ (scale tree) and _Sigillaria_ (seal\r\ntree), and fossils of both are common in Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Lepidodendron_ had long, slender, somewhat tapering trunks. Some of the\r\ntrees reached heights of more than 100 feet and measured more than two\r\nfeet in basal diameter. The trunk ended in a spreading crown formed by\r\nrepeated dichotomous branching. The leaves were awl-shaped or linear,\r\nranging from one to 30 inches long.\r\n\r\nThe leaf cushions of _Lepidodendron_ are diamond-shaped, longer than\r\nbroad, and arranged in spiral rows around the trunk and branches. A\r\ndifferent name, _Lepidophyllum_, is used for fossils of the long,\r\nbladelike leaf when it is found detached.\r\n\r\nSpores were borne in long cylindrical cones at the tips of the branches.\r\nThose cones referred, or assigned, to the genus _Lepidostrobus_ bore\r\nboth small spores (microspores) and large spores (megaspores) in the\r\nsame cones. Those in which only a large single spore, a somewhat\r\nseedlike structure, was developed in a spore sac (sporangium) are\r\nreferred to the genus _Lepidocarpon_.\r\n\r\nThe rather commonly found genus _Stigmaria_ comprises so-called\r\n“appendages” which, although stemlike in structure, apparently served as\r\nroots for the scale and seal trees. These appendages are identified by\r\nirregular spirals of circular scars (pits) that mark the attachment\r\npoints of former rootlets.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Reconstruction of _Sigillaria_\r\n    (after Hirmer)]\r\n\r\n_Sigillaria_, although less common than _Lepidodendron_, was widely\r\ndistributed during the Pennsylvanian Period. It differed in growth habit\r\nfrom _Lepidodendron_ in that it generally had fewer branches and not\r\nuncommonly was unbranched. Some species also possessed a thicker trunk,\r\nwith hexagonal to elongate leaf cushions separated by vertical ribs. The\r\ntrunk was crowned, in the manner of the modern palm tree, by a cluster\r\nof large, grasslike leaves.\r\n\r\nThe detached leaves of _Sigillaria_, extremely difficult to distinguish\r\nfrom _Lepidophyllum_ (leaves of _Lepidodendron_), are referred to the\r\ngenus _Sigillariophyllum_ if preserved as compressions and to\r\n_Sigillariopsis_ if preserved as petrifactions. Unbranched _Sigillaria_\r\ntrunks have been found that are more than 100 feet long and six feet in\r\ndiameter near the base, but the average height probably was closer to 50\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Reconstruction of _Calamites_\r\n    (After Hirmer)]\r\n\r\nNot all Pennsylvanian trees were large, however. Small forms are known,\r\nincluding the important undergrowth genera _Lycopodites_ and\r\n_Selaginellites_. In woody types the trunk consisted of an inner region\r\nof conducting and supporting tissues, surrounding concentric cortical\r\nlayers, and an outer layer of corklike bark. Although the fossil\r\nimpressions of the various bark layers have been given separate generic\r\nnames, these are not commonly used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SCOURING RUSHES\r\n                               (Plate 2)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough related to the small, inconspicuous horsetails of today, the\r\nancient scouring rushes of the Pennsylvanian Period grew to the size of\r\ntrees and were among the most widely distributed plant groups.\r\n\r\nSome of these plants attained heights of 40 feet or more, but the\r\naverage was closer to 20 feet. The trunks were jointed and bore a whorl\r\nof branches at the joints (nodes). Their small leaves also grew in\r\nwhorls at nodes along the smaller branches. Internodal regions were\r\nribbed in the same manner as present day horsetails. Fossils of the\r\ntrunks are assigned to the genus _Calamites_ and quite commonly are\r\npreserved in sandstone and shale.\r\n\r\nThe leaf whorls are placed in the genus _Annularia_. One form commonly\r\nfound in Illinois has long, pointed, needlelike leaves and is given the\r\nname _Asterophyllites_. _Calamostachys_, shown on plate 5, is one of the\r\nmost common calamite cones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SPHENOPHYLLUM\r\n                               (Plate 2)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name _Sphenophyllum_ refers to both stems and leaves of this extinct\r\ngenus, which was related to the scouring rushes—note its resemblance to\r\n_Annularia_.\r\n\r\nA small herbaceous plant, _Sphenophyllum_ formed much of the swampy\r\nundergrowth of the Pennsylvanian Period and is abundant among Illinois\r\nfossils. It had a slender, ribbed stem bearing whorls of delicate,\r\nwedge-shaped leaves, generally less than three-fourths of an inch long,\r\nattached around the stem in multiples of three.\r\n\r\nThe cones of this group also are slender, delicate structures, bearing a\r\nnumber of sporangia, and are correctly called _Bowmanites_, although\r\nthey also have been called _Sphenophyllostachys_. These fossil cones\r\nfrequently are found in Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Sphenophyllum_ first appeared during the Devonian Period, some 300\r\nmillion years ago, but did not become abundant until Pennsylvanian time.\r\nThe genus continued through the Permian but died out in Triassic time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 FERNS\r\n                            (Plates 1 and 3)\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue ferns, like those living in today’s woodlands, were common in the\r\nPennsylvanian forests. Some species attained heights of 30 to 40 feet.\r\nTheir fronds (compound leaves divided into segments or leaflets)\r\ncommonly were five to six feet long.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Portion of fern frond showing sori on lower side of\r\n    leaflets]\r\n\r\nTrue ferns do not produce cones or seeds, but spores, which develop in\r\ncases called sporangia. The sporangia frond showing are attached in\r\nclusters (sori) to the lower side or margins of the leaves. In modern\r\nferns the sporangia may also occur on fertile spikes.\r\n\r\nThe shape and position of the sori are used to identify modern ferns,\r\nbut because leaves that bear sori (“fertile” leaves) are rare among\r\nfossil specimens, the number, shape, and attachment of the leaflets and\r\nthe pattern of the veins are more commonly used for identification.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Reconstruction of _Megaphyton_\r\n    (after Hirmer)]\r\n\r\nBecause fossils of complete fern plants have not yet been found,\r\nseparate names have been adopted for detached leaves, stems, and other\r\nparts. For example, the fossil stems of some Pennsylvanian ferns found\r\nin Illinois have been referred to two genera, _Megaphyton_, whose leaf\r\nattachment scars are arranged in two vertical rows, one on either side\r\nof the stem, and _Caulopteris_, whose leaf scars are arranged in a steep\r\nspiral that becomes progressively flatter upward until near the top they\r\nappear to be whorled. When the stem is a petrifaction, with internal\r\nstructures preserved, it is called _Psaronius_. The fronds are referred\r\nto a number of genera, but those most commonly found in Illinois are\r\n_Pecopteris_, _Asterotheca_, and _Ptychocarpus_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Venation of seed fern leaflets]\r\n\r\n  _Pecopteris_\r\n  _Asterotheca_\r\n  _Ptychocarpus_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SEED FERNS\r\n                               (Plate 4)\r\n\r\n\r\nSeed ferns resembled true ferns in general, but they produced seeds,\r\nborne on modified leaves. Where spore sacs and seeds are absent, the\r\nleaves of seed ferns are difficult to distinguish from those of spore\r\nferns, although individual seed fern leaflets, called pinnae, are\r\nsomewhat larger.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Medullosa_ Reconstruction and original drawing by\r\n    Wilson N. Stewart]\r\n\r\nSeed ferns included vinelike plants in the undergrowth and trees such as\r\n_Medullosa_. Some tree genera were very tall, with trunks more than two\r\nfeet in diameter. Unlike the true ferns, still living today, seed ferns\r\ndeclined steadily after the close of the Pennsylvanian Period and\r\nfinally became extinct during Jurassic time. During Pennsylvanian time,\r\nhowever, they were much more numerous and varied than true ferns.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Venation of seed fern leaflets]\r\n\r\n  _Alethopteris_\r\n  _Odontopteris_\r\n  _Mariopteris_\r\n  _Neuropteris_\r\n  _Linopteris_\r\n\r\nMost of the common seed ferns found as fossils in Illinois can be\r\nreferred to the following leaf genera: _Alethopteris_, _Neuropteris_,\r\n_Odontopteris_, _Linopteris_, _Mariopteris_ (which may be a true fern),\r\n_Cyclopteris_, and _Spiropteris_. _Cyclopteris_ includes circular leaves\r\nthat occurred at the base of leaves referable to _Neuropteris_.\r\n_Spiropteris_ includes young leaves that had not yet uncoiled and may\r\nbelong to either true ferns or seed ferns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CORDAITES\r\n                            (Plates 1 and 2)\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Reconstruction of _Cordaites_\r\n    (after Hirmer)]\r\n\r\nCordaitean trees, forerunners of modern conifers such as pine and\r\nspruce, were important during the Pennsylvanian Period for they were\r\ndistributed throughout the world. These trees, among the tallest plants\r\nof the time, sometimes grew more than 100 feet high.\r\n\r\nThe cordaitean trunk was unbranched for three-fourths of the height of\r\nthe tree and was topped by dense branches bearing large, simple,\r\nstraplike leaves spirally arranged. The leaves had closely set parallel\r\nveins and measured from half an inch to three feet or more long.\r\n\r\nInternally, the structure of the trunks was similar to that of modern\r\npine trunks. Casts of the pith are referred to the genus _Artisia_. The\r\nseeds were borne in clusters on branches in leaf axils.\r\n\r\nThe _Cordaites_ were major contributors to some coal beds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FRUITING BODIES\r\n                               (Plate 5)\r\n\r\n\r\nFossils representing many kinds of plant reproductive structures are\r\nfound in Pennsylvanian rocks, but unfortunately most of them are not\r\nattached to any identifiable part of the parent plant and they cannot be\r\nassigned definitely to a particular plant. Such fossils are referred to\r\ngenera and species solely on the basis of their own characteristics,\r\nalthough, as in other fossil classifications, such “form genera” are\r\npresumed to be parts of, or related to, the plants with which they are\r\nfound in habitual association.\r\n\r\nA few such fossils, fairly common in Illinois, are illustrated on plate\r\n5 to show their general shape and size. When attached to an identifiable\r\nleaf or leaflet, the seed is referred to as the seed of that leaf genus.\r\n\r\nFor example, _Holcospermum_, a radially symmetrical seed with ribs and\r\ngrooves, _Codonotheca_, a stalked, spore-bearing, lobed “cup,” and\r\n_Neuropterocarpus_, a flask-shaped seed with longitudinal ribs and\r\ngrooves, all have been associated with _Neuropteris_, a leaf genus.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Mazon Creek Strip Mine Area Showing Distribution of\r\n    Spoil Heaps. The small circular areas represent waste from\r\n    underground mines.]\r\n\r\n_Trigonocarpus_, commonly found as a cast of the internal part of a\r\nseed, is a trimerously symmetrical body frequently associated with\r\n_Alethopteris_. _Pachytesta_ includes preserved structures and outer\r\nlayers of a seed. _Carpolithes_ is a catch-all “genus” functioning as a\r\ngeneral term for seeds and seedlike forms whose plant group affinities\r\ncannot be determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               COLLECTING AREAS FOR PENNSYLVANIAN PLANTS\r\n                           Northern Illinois\r\n\r\n\r\nPlant fossils can be found in almost any northern Illinois area where\r\nPennsylvanian rocks are exposed (see back cover), but in some places\r\nthey are much better preserved and more numerous than in others. Most of\r\nthe well known collecting areas and a few of the lesser known ones are\r\ndiscussed below. Even though some of the localities were discovered many\r\nyears ago, they may indicate areas that are still favorable for\r\ncollecting.\r\n\r\n\r\nMazon Creek Area\r\n\r\nOf all the fossils that have been found in Illinois, the most famous are\r\nthe plant remains from the world-renowned Mazon Creek area in the\r\nnortheastern part of the state. In this area in Grundy and Will\r\nCounties, plant fossils are found in ironstone concretions in the lower\r\npart of the Francis Creek Shale directly overlying the Colchester (No.\r\n2) Coal.\r\n\r\nFossils were discovered in outcrops along Mazon Creek more than a\r\ncentury ago and collections later were made from scores of conical spoil\r\nheaps at underground mines. After coal stripping began in the 1920’s,\r\ngreat numbers of specimens were collected.\r\n\r\nIn the stripping operations, the concretion-bearing beds are commonly\r\nthe last to be placed on the spoil heap. Weathering softens and removes\r\nthe shales and leaves the nodules concentrated on the surface. Each\r\nseason brings a new crop of concretions to the surface.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Plate 1_]\r\n\r\n  _Calamites_ ⅓×\r\n  _Stigmaria_ ⅖×\r\n  _Lepidodendron_ ⅖×\r\n  _Calamites_ ¹/₁₀×\r\n  Fern Stem ⅔×\r\n  _Caulopteris_ ¼×\r\n  _Sigillaria_ ⅖×\r\n  _Megaphyton_ ⅗×\r\n  _Calamites_ ⅗×\r\n  _Artisia_ ⅗×\r\n  _Sigillaria_ sub-bark ⅗×\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\nThe concretions generally are oval to elongate and range from less than\r\nan inch to a foot or more in maximum dimension. Only about one nodule in\r\nten contains plant remains.\r\n\r\nApproximately 25 to 30 species have been found in this region. The\r\nproductivity of the area was shown by George Langford, Sr., a well known\r\nmidwestern fossil collector. He and his son split about 250 thousand\r\nconcretions during a 140-day period and obtained some 25 thousand plant\r\nspecimens. Fine specimens still can be collected in a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe plant collecting localities in Will and Grundy Counties along Mazon\r\nCreek, four to six miles southeast of the town of Morris, were the first\r\nto be well known. Ferns are especially abundant. Fossils of insects,\r\ncrustaceans, worms, and salamanders also have been found. Collecting\r\nconditions vary considerably from season to season, and fossils are not\r\nas easily obtained there as from the strip-mine spoil heaps.\r\n\r\nFossiliferous concretions may be found in a number of the strip mines in\r\nthe area, although probably most have come from the Northern Illinois\r\nCoal Corporation mine between the towns of Braidwood and Wilmington.\r\n\r\nIn earlier years good collections were made from the spoil heaps of\r\nunderground mines. Especially notable are the mine dumps of the\r\nWilmington Star No. 7 mine, 2¼ miles west of Coal City, and Skinner No.\r\n2 mine, two miles northeast of Braidwood.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Morris on the northwest edge of the Mazon Creek area,\r\nfossil ferns have been found along the north side of the Illinois River\r\nand in the banks of the Illinois-Michigan Canal. About a mile north in\r\nan area of strip mining, fossil-bearing concretions have been found in\r\nshale and irregular sandstone layers.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Plate 2_]\r\n\r\n  _Sphenophyllum_ ⅗×\r\n  _Lepidostrobophyllum_ ⅗×\r\n  _Annularia_ ⅗×\r\n  _Sphenophyllum_ 1×\r\n  _Lycopodites_ ⅗×\r\n  _Cordaites_ ⅗×\r\n  _Asterophyllites_ ⅓×\r\n\r\nFossils in concretions also have been collected from a shaly limestone\r\nat the south end of the Kankakee River bridge along the Grundy and Will\r\ncounty line.\r\n\r\n\r\nBureau County\r\n\r\nSome 40 miles downstream from Morris on the Illinois River, plant\r\nfossils have been discovered in waste from the Spring Valley Coal Co.\r\nmine 1. They also are found in black shale below the LaSalle Limestone\r\nin a small gully in the southwest part of town, but at neither place are\r\nthey plentiful.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnox County\r\n\r\nA notable number and variety of well preserved plant fossils have been\r\nproduced from a locality along Court Creek in East Galesburg. The Rock\r\nIsland (No. 1) Coal is mined in the area and the fossils appear to have\r\ncome from the shale overlying it.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\nFossil plants also have been found in shales above the Colchester (No.\r\n2) Coal in the vicinity of DeLong and with the Herrin (No. 6) Coal in\r\nmines southeast of Victoria.\r\n\r\n\r\nMercer and Warren Counties\r\n\r\nIn northern Warren and southern Mercer Counties the sandstone underlying\r\nthe Rock Island (No. 1) Coal is termed the “Stigmarian” sandstone\r\nbecause of numerous siliceous casts found in the bed. Many of the\r\nfossils have been collected from an old mine dump and from ravines along\r\nthe Edwards River northeast of Aledo.\r\n\r\nA number of representatives of _Sphenophyllum_, _Neuropteris_, and\r\n_Annularia_ have been collected from ironstone concretions occurring in\r\nshale that overlies the Colchester (No. 2) Coal about three miles\r\nsouthwest of Alexis. They were found in a gully about a third of a mile\r\nsoutheast of Center School.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Plate 3_]\r\n\r\n  _Pecopteris_ 1×\r\n  _Ptychocarpus_ ⅗×\r\n  _Pecopteris_ ⅗×\r\n  _Mariopteris_ ⅗×\r\n  _Asterotheca_ ⅗×\r\n  _Spiropteris_ ⅗×\r\n  _Pecopteris_ ⅗×\r\n\r\nIn the same general area but about three miles due south of Alexis,\r\nfossil plants also may be found in the clay pits of the Hydraulic-Press\r\nBrick Company and the Northwestern Clay Manufacturing Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nFulton County\r\n\r\nAlthough there are numerous isolated occurrences of plant fossils\r\nthroughout the extensive strip mines and outcrops in Fulton County, no\r\nexceptionally good collecting localities have been discovered.\r\n\r\nFern and cordaitean leaves have been collected along Mill Creek about a\r\nmile northeast of Pleasantview where the fossils occur in the shale\r\noverlying the Babylon Coal. In the same general area, impressions and\r\ncasts of _Stigmaria_, _Lepidodendron_, and _Cordaites_ have been found\r\nin the Babylon Sandstone.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\nThree miles north of Pleasantview, a quarter of a mile northwest of\r\nUnion School, several species of leaves have been collected from the\r\nBrowning Sandstone where it is exposed in a roadcut.\r\n\r\nFarther east, there is a fairly good locality in the stream bluff of\r\nKerton Creek about 3¼ miles north and a quarter of a mile west of Bluff\r\nCity. There the plants are found about 18 feet below a coal bed.\r\n\r\nNumerous fern impressions also are found in shale beds above the Herrin\r\n(No. 6) Coal along the Middle Branch of Copperas Creek, six miles west\r\nof Glasford. Other specimens may be found in these beds elsewhere in the\r\narea.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcDonough County\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\nIn some of the small underground mines near Colchester, the shale\r\noverlying the Colchester (No. 2) Coal contains ironstone concretions\r\nsimilar to those from northeastern Illinois. More than 50 species of\r\nplant fossils have been reported, but they were collected many years ago\r\nfrom spoil heaps at the mines. Beds of the same age crop out widely in\r\nother localities in western Illinois and may contain plant fossils.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Plate 4_]\r\n\r\n  _Sphenopteris_ ⅗×\r\n  _Linopteris_ ⅗×\r\n  _Neuropteris_ ½×\r\n  _Odontopteris_ ⅗×\r\n  _Cycopteris_ ½×\r\n  _Alethopteris_ ⅗×\r\n  _Alethopteris_ ⅗×\r\n  _Odontopteris_ ½×\r\n  _Alethopteris_ ⅗×\r\n\r\n\r\nVermilion County\r\n\r\nIn outcrops about three miles below Georgetown on the Little Vermilion\r\nRiver, a number of fossil plant species and one insect species have been\r\ncollected from shales overlying the Herrin (No. 6) Coal, locally called\r\nthe Grape Creek Coal. The fossils occur in concretions much like those\r\nfrom Mazon Creek.\r\n\r\nAn occasional stem replacement or impression is found in the\r\nconcretionary shale above the No. 7 Coal in the strip mine area west of\r\nHillery. In fact, isolated fragmentary plant specimens are fairly common\r\nin the Danville mining area, but no especially productive localities\r\nhave come to light.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Northern Illinois Localities\r\n\r\nIn addition to the counties listed above, a number of others have\r\nproduced plant fossils. For example, there are records of plant fossils\r\nfound southeast of Franklin in Morgan County, at Neelys in Peoria\r\nCounty, and at a number of places in the southern and western parts of\r\nRock Island County. Local exploration is certain to turn up numerous\r\nother collecting places at present unknown.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Plate 5_]\r\n\r\n  _Codonotheca_ ⅗×\r\n  _Calamostachys_ 1×\r\n  _Pachytesta_ ⅗×\r\n  _Codonospermum_ ⅗×\r\n  _Cordaicorpus_ ⅗×\r\n  _Samaropsis_ ½×\r\n  _Whittleseya_ 1×\r\n  _Trigonocorpus_ ¼×\r\n  _Holcospermum_ ⅗×\r\n  _Neuropterocarpus_ ⅗×\r\n  _Lepidostrobus_ ⅗×\r\n  _Carpolithes_ ⅗×\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Southern Illinois\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\n\r\nLawrence County\r\n\r\nNear the Lawrence-Richland county line, not far from the towns of\r\nBerryville and Calhoun, there is an area rich in the fossil\r\npetrifactions called “coal balls” in which cellular structures of stems\r\nand roots generally are well preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaline, Pope, and Johnson Counties\r\n\r\nSaline County has more recorded plant fossil localities than any other\r\nsouthern Illinois county. Fossil plant collecting localities are\r\nisolated but numerous in the area southwest of Harrisburg. Mine dumps,\r\nsuch as in the area five or six miles northwest of Eddyville, and many\r\noutcrops are available throughout the region. The fossils probably are\r\nassociated with the Murphysboro, Delwood, Willis, Reynoldsburg, and\r\nBattery Rock Coals.\r\n\r\nOne especially good collecting area is on the south tributary of the\r\nEast Branch Cedar Creek about 6½ miles south of Stonefort. The fossils\r\nare found in six feet of shale overlying the Battery Rock Coal horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerry and Jackson Counties\r\n\r\nNear DuQuoin and Murphysboro, a variety of well preserved plant fossils\r\nhas been collected from shales overlying both the Herrin (No. 6) Coal\r\nand the Murphysboro Coal. Nearly all have come from shaft mines that are\r\nnot easily accessible to the collector.\r\n\r\nOne currently good outcrop locality for collecting plant fossils from\r\nthe shale above the Murphysboro Coal is just southeast of Murphysboro.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Southern Illinois Localities\r\n\r\nOther collecting localities have been recorded west of McLeansboro in\r\nHamilton County, northwest of Mt. Vernon in Jefferson County, near\r\nGrayville in White County, and in the Friendsville area of Wabash\r\nCounty. There is no doubt that careful search will turn up many more.\r\n\r\nAlmost anywhere in the large coal producing areas of southern Illinois\r\nplant fossils can be found either in spoil heaps or in outcrops along\r\nstream, road, and railroad cuts. The thick Pennsylvanian sandstones that\r\ncrop out in a belt extending through Gallatin, Saline, Williamson, and\r\nJackson Counties generally contain compressions or replacements of\r\ntrunks or other woody plant parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            SUGGESTIONS FOR COLLECTING PENNSYLVANIAN PLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere to Look for Plant Fossils\r\n\r\nPennsylvanian plants are most commonly found in shales directly\r\noverlying coal beds. The shales are believed to be of nonmarine origin\r\nlike the coals and may contain fossils either in ironstone concretions\r\nor on the bedding planes. The shale layers as well as the concretions\r\nshould be examined. Where the bed directly overlying the coal consists\r\nof black slaty shale or limestone containing marine fossils, plant\r\nremains are rarely abundant or well preserved.\r\n\r\nBeneath the coals there generally is an underclay that is interpreted as\r\nthe material in which the coal forest grew. The underclay is in turn\r\nunderlain by a sandstone, and both are believed to be mostly nonmarine.\r\nStigmarian axes and “roots” are common in many of the underclays. Plant\r\nfossils are common in the sandstone but generally are poorly preserved,\r\nexcept in the local shaly lenses.\r\n\r\nThe best place to look for plant fossils in northern Illinois, except\r\nfor the strip mines of the Mazon Creek area, is probably in the spoil\r\nheaps from shaft mines. The Colchester (No. 2) Coal has been extensively\r\nmined by the longwall method. This technique causes the mine roof to\r\nsettle when the coal is removed, and the haulage ways are kept open by\r\nremoving the roof shale. Inasmuch as the roof shale is the Francis Creek\r\nFormation of the Mazon Creek area, it may contain abundant plant-bearing\r\nconcretions. The shale is not everywhere fossiliferous, however, and in\r\nmany spoil heaps fossils are rare.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Tools for Collecting]\r\n\r\n\r\nCollecting Equipment\r\n\r\nThe collector of plant fossils should have the following tools and\r\nequipment:\r\n\r\n  ① Hammer—a bricklayer’s hammer will work well.\r\n  ② One or two chisels, preferably one large and one small.\r\n  ③ Knapsack or basket in which to carry specimens.\r\n  ④ Newspapers and a roll of tissue paper for protecting fragile\r\n              specimens.\r\n  ⑤ Pencil and paper for labeling specimens and making notes about the\r\n              collecting locality from which the fossils came. Much of\r\n              the value of a particular fossil lies in knowing precisely\r\n              where it was found and the layer of rock it came from.\r\n\r\n\r\nRules of Courtesy\r\n\r\nWhen entering a collecting area every collector should observe several\r\nrules carefully:\r\n\r\n① For your own protection get permission to enter and collect on any\r\nprivate property. Such action also will help to assure your welcome if\r\nyou wish to come back again.\r\n\r\n② Leave the gates exactly as you find them, open or closed. Do not climb\r\nfences that may break or sag under your weight; crawl under or go\r\naround.\r\n\r\n③ Don’t litter, even though far from any house or other buildings. Do\r\nnot disturb the owner’s equipment, stock, or planted areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nHandling Specimens\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\nThe most successful way to split an ironstone concretion is to set it on\r\nedge, long axis horizontal, on any fairly large rock and strike the\r\nupper edge with the hammer. If the concretion is one that developed\r\naround a fossil nucleus, it generally will split along the plane of\r\nweakness, revealing the fossil. Sometimes one side of the concretion\r\nwill break off in the middle, in which case the remainder should be\r\ntapped firmly but gently on the upper edge until the fossil is\r\ncompletely uncovered. Pieces of the broken half should be glued together\r\nneatly with waterproof cement so that the entire specimen can be\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nFossils embedded in shale may be recovered by the same method or by\r\nrepeatedly tapping a chisel inserted along the bedding plane. If the\r\nfossil is exposed, the matrix can be chiseled away by slow, painstaking\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nThe usual method of wrapping plant-bearing nodules is to place the end\r\nof a sheet of newspaper between the two halves of the nodule, fold the\r\npaper over the nodule, and roll it up in the sheet.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: How to Wrap a Fossiliferous Concretion]\r\n\r\nWhen several localities are visited in one collecting trip, the fossils\r\nfrom each should be kept separate; cloth bags are convenient for this\r\npurpose. Notes about the locality should be put in the same bag as\r\nfossils from that locality so that there is no possibility of confusion.\r\n\r\nSome fossils are so fragile or porous that they should be covered with a\r\nhardening protective coat of crude gum arabic solution. (Refined gum\r\narabic will not serve.) This may be applied with a fine brush in\r\nsuccessive layers, or sturdier fossils may be dipped in it.\r\n\r\nWhen a fossil is so delicate that the surface tension of the gum arabic\r\nsolution causes the fossil to “spread,” celluloid (not plastic)\r\ndissolved in acetone should be substituted. Before this solution is\r\nused, the specimen must be completely dry or the coating will become\r\ncloudy or opaque.\r\n\r\nIf the specimen is pyritized, it should be sprayed with lacquer or\r\nshellac to prevent disintegration. If these protective sprays are used\r\nthey must be applied to dry specimens during dry weather or the coating\r\nwill remain sticky.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               REFERENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INTRODUCTION TO PALEOBOTANY.
