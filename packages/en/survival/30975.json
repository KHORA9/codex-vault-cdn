The result has been the acquisition of more\r\nknowledge on the subjects embraced, than the world had attained in all\r\nits previous history. That knowledge is scattered through many volumes\r\nof numerous periodicals and books, and interspersed with many theories,\r\nand much speculation, that can never be valuable in practice. In the\r\nform in which it is presented, it confuses, rather than aids, the great\r\nmass of cultivators. Hence the prejudice against \"_book-farming_.\"\r\nProvided established facts only are presented, they are none the worse\r\nfor being printed.\r\n\r\nThe object of this volume is to condense, and present in an intelligible\r\nform, all important established facts in the science of soil-culture.\r\nThe author claims originality, as to the discovery of facts and\r\nprinciples, in but few cases. During ten years of preparatory study for\r\nthis work, he has sought the rewards of industry, in sifting out the\r\ncertain and the useful from the hypothetical and the fanciful, and the\r\nresults of judicious discrimination between fallacy and just reasoning,\r\nin support of theories. This volume is designed to be a complete manual\r\nfor all but amateur cultivators. While it is believed that he who\r\nfollows its directions will be certain of success, it is not intended to\r\ndisparage the merits of other works, but to encourage and extend their\r\nperusal. We can not too strongly recommend to young culturists to keep\r\nthemselves well posted in this kind of literature, and give to every\r\ndiscovery and invention in this science a fair trial; not on a large\r\nscale, so as to sink money in fruitless experiments, but sufficient to\r\nafford a sure test of their real value. To no class of men is study more\r\nimportant than to soil-culturists.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the directions here given, if followed, will save\r\nmillions of dollars annually to that class of cultivators who can least\r\nafford to waste time and money in experimenting. With beginners it is\r\nimportant to be successful at first; which is impossible without\r\navailing themselves of the experience of others. While we thus aim to\r\ngive our volume this exclusively practical form, and utilitarian\r\ncharacter, we do not undervalue the labors of amateur cultivators. A\r\nmeed of praise is due to those who are willing to spend time and money\r\nin experiments, by which great truths are evolved for the benefit of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nPerfection is not claimed for this volume. But the author hopes nothing\r\nwill be found here that is untrue. A fear of inserting errors may have\r\ninduced us to omit some things that may yet prove valuable. If anything\r\nseems to be at variance with a cultivator's observation, in a given\r\nlocality, he will discover in our general principles on climate, soil,\r\nand location, that it is a natural result.\r\n\r\n_Accurate as far as we go_ has been our motto. It is hoped the form is\r\nmost convenient. All is arranged under one alphabet, with a complete\r\nindex. The author has consulted many intelligent cultivators and\r\nwriters, who, without exception, approve his plan. All agree in saying\r\nthat it is designed to fill a place not occupied by any other single\r\nvolume in the language. It is impossible, without cumbering the volume,\r\nto give suitable credit to the authors and persons consulted. Suffice it\r\nto say, the author has carefully studied all the works mentioned in this\r\nvolume, and availed himself of a great variety of verbal suggestions, by\r\nscientific and practical men. If this work shall, in any good degree,\r\nserve the purpose for which it is intended, it will amply reward the\r\nauthor for an amount of labor, experiment, observation, and study,\r\nappreciable only by few.\r\n\r\nJ.

Removal to a colder climate should be effected in\r\nthe spring, and to a warmer one in the fall. This may be done by scions\r\nor seeds. By seeds is better, in all cases in which they will produce\r\nthe same varieties. Very few imported apple or pear trees are valuable\r\nin this country; while our finest varieties, perfectly adapted to our\r\nclimate, were raised from seeds of foreign fruits and their descendants.\r\nThe same is true of the extremes of this country. Baldwin apple-trees,\r\nforty or fifty years old, are perfectly hardy in the colder parts of New\r\nEngland; while the same imported from warmer sections of the Union fail\r\nin severe winters. This fact has given many new localities the\r\nreputation of being poor fruit-regions. When we remove fruit-trees to a\r\nsimilar climate in a new country, they flourish well, and we call it a\r\ngood fruit-country. Remove trees from the same nursery to a different\r\nclimate and soil, and they are not hardy and vigorous, and we call it a\r\npoor fruit-country. These two localities may be equally good for fruit,\r\nwith suitable care in acclimating the tree and preparing the soil. Thus\r\nthe rich prairies of central Illinois are often said not to be adapted\r\nto fruit. Give time to raise fruits from the seed, and to apply the\r\nprinciples of acclimation, and those rich prairies will be among the\r\ngreat fruit-growing regions of the world. Two things are essential to\r\nsuccessful fruit-culture, on all the alluvial soils of the Northwest:\r\nraise from seed, and prune closely and head-in short, and thus put back\r\nand strengthen the trees for the first ten years, and no more complaints\r\nwill be heard.\r\n\r\nThe peach has been gradually acclimated, until, transplanted from\r\nperpetual summer, it successfully endures a temperature of thirty-five\r\ndegrees below zero. This prince of fruits will yet be successfully grown\r\neven beyond the northern limits of Minnesota. Many vegetables may also\r\nbe grown in very different climates, by annually importing the seed from\r\nlocalities where they naturally flourish. Sweet potatoes are thus grown\r\nabundantly in Massachusetts. We wonder this subject has received so\r\nlittle attention. We commend these brief hints to the earnest\r\nconsideration of all practical cultivators, hoping they may be of great\r\nvalue in the results to which they may lead.\r\n\r\n\r\nALMONDS.\r\n\r\nAlmonds are natives of several parts of Asia and Africa. They perfectly\r\nresemble the peach in all but the fruit. The peach and almond grow well,\r\nbudded into each other. In France, almond-stocks are preferred for the\r\npeach. Their cultivation and propagation are in all respects the same as\r\nthe peach.\r\n\r\n_Varieties._--1. Long, hard shell. This is the best for cultivation in\r\nwestern and middle states, and in all cold regions. Very ornamental.\r\n\r\n2. Common sweet. Productive in middle states, but not so good as the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n3. Ladies' thin shell. Fruit large, long, and sweet; the very best\r\nvariety, but not so hardy as the first two. Grows well in warm\r\nlocations, with slight protection in winter.\r\n\r\n4. The bitter. Large, with very ornamental leaves and blossoms. Fruit\r\nbitter, and yielding that deadly poison, prussic acid.\r\n\r\n5. Peach almond. So called from having a pulp equal to a poor peach. Not\r\nhardy in northern climates. Other varieties are named, but are of no\r\nconsequence to the practical cultivator.\r\n\r\n6. Two varieties of ornamental almonds are very beautiful in spring--the\r\nlarge, double flowering, and the well-known dwarf flowering. But we\r\nregard peach-blossoms quite as ornamental, and the ripe peaches much\r\nmore so, and so prefer to cultivate them.\r\n\r\nAlmonds are extensively cultivated in the south of Europe, especially in\r\nPortugal, as an article of commerce. They will grow equally well in this\r\ncountry; but labor is so cheap in Europe, that American cultivators can\r\nnot compete with it in the almond market. But every one owning land\r\nshould cultivate a few as a family luxury.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLES.\r\n\r\nThe original of all our apples was the wild European crab. We have in\r\nthis country several native crabs larger and better than the European;\r\nbut they have not yet, as we are aware, been developed into fine apples.\r\nApple-trees are hardy and long-lived, doing well for one hundred and\r\nfifty years. Highly-cultivated trees, however, are thought to last only\r\nabout fifty years. An apple-tree, imported from England, produced fruit\r\nin Connecticut at the age of two hundred and eight years. The apple is\r\nthe most valuable of all fruits. The peach, the best pears, the\r\nstrawberries, and others, are all delicious in their day; but apples are\r\nadapted to a greater variety of uses, and are in perfection all the\r\nyear; the earliest may be used in June, and the latest may be kept until\r\nthat time next year. As an article of food, they are very valuable on\r\naccount of both their nutritive and medicinal qualities. As a gentle\r\nlaxative, they are invaluable for children, who should always be allowed\r\nto eat ripe apples as they please, when they can be afforded. Children\r\nwill not long be inclined to eat ripe fruit to their injury.\r\n\r\nAn almost exclusive diet of baked sweet apples and milk is recorded as\r\nhaving cured chronic cases of consumption, and other diseases caused by\r\ntoo rich food. Let dyspeptics vary the mode of preparing and using an\r\napple diet, until it agrees with them, and many aggravated cases may be\r\ncured without medicine. It is strange how the idea has gained so much\r\ncurrency that apples, although a pleasant luxury, are not sufficiently\r\nnutritious for a valuable article of diet. There is no other fruit or\r\nvegetable in general use that contains such a proportion of nutriment.\r\nIt has been ascertained in Germany, by a long course of experiments,\r\nthat men will perform more labor, endure more fatigue, and be more\r\nhealthy, on an apple diet, than on that universal indispensable for the\r\npoor, the potato. Apples are more valuable than potatoes for food. They\r\nare equally valuable as food for fowls, swine, sheep, cattle, and\r\nhorses. Hogs have been well fattened on apples alone. Cooked with other\r\nvegetables, and mixed with a little ground grain or bran, they are an\r\neconomical food for fattening pork or beef. Sweet or slightly-acid\r\napples, fed to neat stock or horses, will prevent disease, and keep the\r\nanimals in fine condition. For human food they may be cooked in a\r\ngreater variety of ways than almost any other article. Apple-cider is\r\nvaluable for some uses. It makes the best vinegar in general use, and,\r\nwhen well made and bottled, is better than most of our wines for\r\ninvalids. Apple-molasses, or boiled cider, which is sweet-apple cider\r\nboiled down until it will not ferment, is excellent in cookery.\r\nApple-butter is highly esteemed in many families. Dried apples are an\r\nimportant article of commerce. Green apples are also exported to most\r\nparts of the world. Notwithstanding the increased attention to their\r\ncultivation during the last half-century, their market value is steadily\r\nincreasing, and doubtless will be, for the best varieties, for the next\r\nfive hundred years.\r\n\r\nIt does not cost more than five or six cents per bushel to raise apples;\r\nhence they are one of the most profitable crops a farmer can raise. No\r\nfarm, therefore, is complete without a good orchard. The man who owns\r\nbut five acres of land should have at least two acres in fruit-trees.\r\n\r\n_Soil._--Apples will succeed well on any soil that will produce good\r\ncabbages, potatoes, or Indian corn. Land needs as much manure and care\r\nfor apple-trees as for potatoes. Rough hillsides and broken lands,\r\nunsuitable for general cultivation, may be made very valuable in\r\norchards. It must be enriched, if not originally so, and kept clean\r\nabout the trees. On no crop does good culture pay better. Many suppose\r\nthat an apple-tree, being a great grower, will take care of itself after\r\nhaving attained a moderate size. Whoever observes the great and rapid\r\ngrowth of apple-trees must see, that, when the ground is nearly covered\r\nwith them, they must make a great draft on the soil. To secure health\r\nand increased value, the deficiency must be supplied in manure and\r\ncultivation. The quantity and quality of the fruit depend mainly on the\r\ncondition of the land. The kinds and proportions of manures best for an\r\napple-orchard are important practical questions. We give a chemical\r\nanalysis of the ashes of the apple-tree, which will indicate, even to\r\nthe unlearned, the manure that will probably be needed:--\r\n\r\n_Analysis of the ash of the apple-tree._\r\n\r\n                       Sap-wood.

Lime and ashes, or dissolved potash, are\r\nindispensable on an old orchard; they will improve the fruit one half,\r\nboth in quantity and quality.\r\n\r\n_Propagation._--This is done mainly by seeds, budding and grafting. The\r\nbest method is by common cleft-grafting on all stocks large enough, and\r\nby whip or tongue grafting on all others. (See under article, Grafting.)\r\n\r\nGrafting into the sycamore is recommended by some. The scions are said\r\nto grow profusely, and to bear early and abundantly; but they are apt to\r\nbe killed by cold winters. We do not recommend it. Almost everything\r\ndoes best budded or grafted into vigorous stocks of its own nature.\r\nRoot-grafting, as it is termed,--that is, cutting up roots into pieces\r\nthree or four inches long, and putting a scion into each--has been a\r\nmatter of much discussion and diversity of opinion. It is certainly a\r\nmeans of most rapidly multiplying a given variety, and is therefore\r\nprofitable to the nurseryman. For ourselves, we should prefer trees\r\ngrafted just above, or at the ground, using the whole stock for one\r\ntree. We do not, however, undertake to settle this controverted point.\r\nOur minds are fixed against it. Others must do as they please.\r\nPropagation by seed is thought to be entirely uncertain, because, as is\r\nsupposed, the seeds will not reproduce their own varieties. We consider\r\nthis far from being an established fact.\r\n\r\nWhen grafts are put into large trees, high up from the ground, their\r\nfruit may be somewhat modified by the stock. There is also a slight\r\ntendency in the seeds of all grafts to return to the varieties from\r\nwhich they descended. But we believe the general rule to be, that the\r\nseeds of grafts, put in at the ground and standing alone, will generally\r\nproduce the same varieties of fruit. The most prominent obstacle in the\r\nway of this reproduction is the presence of other varieties, which mix\r\nin the blossom. The planting of seeds from any mixed orchard can never\r\nsettle this question, because they are never pure. Propagation by seeds,\r\nthen, is an inconvenient method, only to be resorted to for purposes of\r\nacclimation. But it is so seldom we have a good bearing apple-tree so\r\nfar removed from others as not to be affected by the blossoms, that we\r\ngenerally get from seeds a modification of varieties. Raising suitable\r\nstocks for grafting is done by planting seeds in drills thirty inches\r\napart, and keeping clear of weeds until they are large enough to graft.\r\nThe soil should be made very rich, to save time in their growth. Land\r\nwhere root-crops grew the previous year is the best. If kept clear of\r\nweeds, on rich, deep soil, from one to two thirds of them will be large\r\nenough for whip-grafting after the first year's growth. The pomice from\r\nthe cider-mill is often planted. It is better to separate the seeds,\r\nand plant them with a seed-drill. They will then be in straight, narrow\r\nrows, allowing the cultivator and hoe to pass close by them, and thus\r\nsave two thirds of the cost of cultivation. The question of keeping\r\nseeds dry or moist until planting is one of some importance. Most seeds\r\nare better for being kept slightly moist until planted; but with the\r\napple it makes no difference. Keep apple-seeds dry and spread, as they\r\nare apt to heat. Freezing them is not of the slightest importance. If\r\nyou plant pomice, put in a little lime or ashes to counteract the acid.\r\nFor winter-grafting, pull the seedlings that are of suitable size, cut\r\noff the tops eight inches from the root, and pack in moist sand in a\r\ncellar that will not freeze. After grafting, tie them up in bunches, and\r\npack in tight boxes of moist sand or sawdust.\r\n\r\n_Transplanting._--This is fully treated elsewhere in this work. We give\r\nunder each fruit only what is peculiar to that species. In mild climates\r\ntransplant in the fall, and in cold in the spring. Spring-planting must\r\nnever be done until the soil has become dry enough to be made fine. A\r\nthoroughly-pulverized soil is the great essential of successful\r\ntransplanting. Trees for spring-planting should always be taken up\r\nbefore the commencement of vegetation. But in very wet springs, this\r\noccurs before the ground becomes sufficiently dry; it is then best to\r\ntake up the trees and heel them in, and keep them until the soil is\r\nsuitable. The place for an apple-tree should be made larger than for any\r\nother tree, because its roots are wide-spreading, like its branches. The\r\nearth should be thrown out to the depth of twenty inches, and four or\r\nfive feet square, for an ordinary-sized tree. This, however, will not\r\ndo on a heavy clay subsoil, for it would form a basin to hold water and\r\ninjure the tree. A ditch, as low as the bottom of the holes, should\r\nextend from tree to tree, and running out of the orchard, constructed in\r\nthe usual method of drains, and, whatever be the subsoil, the trees will\r\nflourish. The usual compost to manure the trees in transplanting will be\r\nfound elsewhere. In the bottom of these places for apple-trees should be\r\nthrown a plenty of cobblestones, with a few sods, and a little decaying\r\nwood and coarse manure. We know of nothing so good under an apple-tree\r\nas small stones; the tree will always be the larger and thriftier for\r\nit. This is, in a degree, beneficial to other fruits, but peculiarly so\r\nto the apple.\r\n\r\n_Size for transplanting._--Small trees usually do best. Large trees are\r\noften transplanted with the hope of having an abundance of fruit\r\nearlier. This usually defeats the object. The large trees will bear a\r\nlittle fruit earlier than the small ones; but the injury by removal is\r\nso much greater, that the small stocky trees come into full, regular\r\nbearing much the soonest. From five to eight feet high is often most\r\nconvenient for field-orchard culture. But, wherever we can take care of\r\nthem, it is better to set out smaller trees; they will do better for\r\nyears. A suitable drain, extending through the orchard, under each row\r\nof trees, will make a good orchard on low, wet land.\r\n\r\n_Trimming at the time of transplanting._--Injured roots should be\r\nremoved as in the general directions under Transplanting. But the idea\r\nof cutting off most of the top is a very serious error. When large trees\r\nare transplanted, which must necessarily lose many of their roots in\r\nremoval, a corresponding portion of the top must be separated; but in no\r\nother case. The leaves are the lungs of the tree. How shall it have\r\nvitality if most of them are removed? It is like destroying one lung and\r\nhalf of the other, and then expect a man to be in vigorous health. We\r\nhave often seen the most of two years' growth of trees lost by such\r\nreckless pruning. If the roots are tolerably whole and sound, leave the\r\ntop so. A peach-tree needs to be trimmed much closer when transplanted,\r\nbecause it has so many more buds to throw out leaves.\r\n\r\n_Mulching._--This is quite as beneficial to apple-trees as to all\r\ntransplanted trees. Well done, it preserves a regularity of moisture\r\nthat almost insures the life of the tree.\r\n\r\n_Pruning._--The tops should be kept open and exposed to the sun, the\r\ncross limbs cut out, and everything removed that shows decided symptoms\r\nof decay. The productiveness of apple-trees depends very much upon\r\npruning very sparingly and judiciously. There are two ways to keep an\r\nopen top: one is, to allow many large limbs to grow, and cut out most of\r\nthe small ones, thus leaving a large collection of bare poles without\r\nanything on which the fruit can grow;--the other method is to allow few\r\nlimbs to grow large, and keep them well covered with small twigs, which\r\nalways bear the fruit. The latter method will produce two or three times\r\nas much fruit as the former.\r\n\r\nThe head of an apple-tree should be formed at a height that will allow a\r\nteam to pass around under its branches.\r\n\r\n_Distance apart._--In a full-grown orchard, that is designed to cover\r\nthe ground, the trees should be two rods (thirty-three feet) apart.\r\nWhen it is designed always to cultivate the ground, and land is plenty,\r\nset them fifty or sixty feet apart. You will be likely always to have\r\nfine fruit, and a crop on the land beside. Our recommendation to every\r\none is to set out all orchards, of whatever fruit, so as to have them\r\ncover the whole ground when in maturity. Among apple-trees, dwarf pears,\r\npeaches, or quinces, may be set, which will be profitable before the\r\napples need all the ground.\r\n\r\n_Bearing years._--A cultivator may have a part of his orchard bear one\r\nyear, and the remainder the next, or he may have them all bear every\r\nyear. There are two reasons why a tree bears full this year and will not\r\nbear the next. One is, it is allowed to have such a superabundance of\r\nfruit to mature this year, that it has no strength to mature fruit-buds\r\nfor the next, and hence a barren year; the other reason is, a want of\r\nproper culture and the specific manures for the apple. Manure highly,\r\nkeep off the insects, cultivate well, and do not allow too much to\r\nremain on the trees one season, and you will have a good crop every\r\nyear. But if one would let his trees take the natural course, but wishes\r\nto change the bearing year of half of his orchard, he can accomplish it\r\nby removing the blossoms or young fruit from a part of his trees on the\r\nbearing year, and those trees having no fruit to mature will put forth\r\nan abundance of buds for fruit the following season; thus the\r\nfruit-season will be changed without lessening the productiveness. Go\r\nthrough a fruit-region in what is called the non-bearing seasons, and\r\nyou will find some orchards and some trees very full of fruit. Trees of\r\nthe same variety in another orchard near by will have very little fruit.\r\nThis shows that the bearing season is a matter of mere habit, in all\r\nexcept what is determined by late frosts. This fact may be turned to\r\ngreat pecuniary value, by producing an abundance of apples every year.\r\n\r\n_Plowing and pasturing._--An apple-orchard should be often plowed, but\r\nnot too deep among the roots. When not actually under the plow, it\r\nshould be pastured, with fowls, calves, or sheep. Swine are recommended,\r\nas they will eat all the apples that fall prematurely, and with them the\r\nworms that made them fall. But we have often seen hogs, by their rooting\r\nand rubbing, kill the trees. Better to pick up the apples that fall too\r\nearly, and give them to the swine. Turkeys and hens in an orchard will\r\ndo much to destroy the various insects. They may be removed for a short\r\ntime when they begin to peck the ripening fruit.\r\n\r\nOrchards pastured by sheep are said not to be infested with\r\ncaterpillars. Sheep pastured and salted under apple-trees greatly enrich\r\nthe soil, and in those elements peculiarly beneficial.\r\n\r\n_Enemies._--There are several of these that are quite destructive, when\r\nnot properly guarded against. Two things are necessary, and, united and\r\nthoroughly performed, they afford a remedy or a preventive for most of\r\nthe depredations of all insects: 1. Keep the trees well cleared of all\r\nrough, loose bark, which affords so many hiding-places for insects.\r\n\r\n2. Wash the trunks and large limbs of the trees, twice between the 25th\r\nof May and the 15th of August, with a ley of wood-ashes or dissolved\r\npotash. Apple-trees will bear it strong enough to kill some of the\r\nfinest cherries. We add another very effectual wash. Let cultivators\r\nchoose between the two. Into two gallons of water put two quarts of\r\nsoft-soap and one fourth pound of sulphur. If you add tobacco-juice, or\r\nany other very offensive article, it will be still better.\r\n\r\n_Apple-worm._--The insect that produces this worm lays its egg in the\r\nblossom-end of the young apple. That egg makes a worm that passes down\r\nabout the core and ruins the fruit. Apples so affected will fall\r\nprematurely, and should be picked up and fed to swine. This done every\r\nday during their falling, which does not last a great while, will remedy\r\nthe evil in two seasons. The worm that crawls from the fallen apple gets\r\ninto crevices in rough bark, and spins his cocoon, in which he remains\r\ntill the following spring.\r\n\r\nBonfires, for a few evenings in the fore part of June, in an orchard\r\ninfested with moths, will destroy vast numbers of them, before they have\r\ndeposited their eggs. This can not be too strongly insisted upon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Apple-Worms.\r\n\r\n_a_ The young worm. _b_ The full-grown worm. _c_ The same magnified. _d_\r\nCocoon. _e_ Chrysalis. _f_ Perfect insect. _g_ The same magnified. _h i_\r\nPassage of the worm in the fruit. _j_ Worm in the fruit. _k_ Place of\r\negress.]\r\n\r\n_Bark-louse._--Dull white, oval scales, one tenth of an inch long, which\r\nsometimes appear on the stems of trees in vast numbers, may be destroyed\r\nby the wash recommended above.\r\n\r\n_Woolly aphis_--called in Europe by the misnomer, _American blight_--is\r\nvery destructive across the water, but does not exist extensively on\r\nthis side. It is supposed to exist, in this country, only where it has\r\nbeen introduced with imported trees. It appears as a white downy\r\nsubstance in the small forks of trees. This is composed of a large\r\nnumber of very minute woolly lice, which increase with wonderful\r\nrapidity. They are easily destroyed by washing with diluted sulphuric\r\nacid--three fourths of an ounce, by measure, from the druggist's--and\r\nseven and a half ounces of water, applied by a rag tied to the end of a\r\nstick. The operator must keep it from his clothes. After the first rain\r\nthis is perfectly effectual.\r\n\r\n_Apple-tree borer._--This is a fleshy-white grub, found in the trunks of\r\nthe trees. It enters at the surface of the ground where the bark is\r\ntender, and either girdles or thoroughly perforates the tree, causing\r\nits death. This is produced by a brown and white striped beetle about\r\nhalf an inch long. It does not go through its different stages annually,\r\nbut remains a grub two or three years. It finally comes out in its\r\nwinged state, early in June, flying in the night and laying its eggs. If\r\nthe borers are already in the tree, they may be killed by cutting out,\r\nor by a steel wire thrust into their holes. But better prevent them.\r\nThis can be done effectually by placing a small mound of ashes or lime\r\naround each tree early in the spring.\r\n\r\nOn nursery-trees their attacks may be prevented by washing with a\r\nsolution of potash--two pounds in eight quarts of water. As this is a\r\ngood manure, as well as a great remedy for insects, it had better be\r\nused every season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Borer. Eggs. Beetle.]\r\n\r\n_Caterpillars_ are the product of a miller of a reddish-brown color,\r\nmeasuring about an inch and a half when flying. They deposit many eggs\r\nabout the forks and near the extremities of young branches. These hatch\r\nin spring, in season for the young foliage, on which they feed\r\nvoraciously. When neglected for two or three years, they often defoliate\r\nlarge trees. The habits of the caterpillar are favorable to their\r\ndestruction. They weave their webs in forks of trees, and are always at\r\nhome in rainy weather, and in the morning till nine o'clock. The remedy\r\nis to kill them. This is most effectually done by a sponge on the end of\r\na pole, dipped in strong spirits of ammonia. Each one touched by it is\r\ninstantly killed, and it is not difficult to reach them all. They may\r\nalso be rubbed off with a brush or swab on the end of a pole, and\r\nburned. The principle is to get them off, web and all, and destroy them.\r\nThis can always be effectually done, if attended to early in the season,\r\nand early in the morning. If any have been missed, and come out in\r\ninsects to deposite more eggs, bonfires are most effectual. These\r\nshould be made of shavings, in different parts of the orchard, and about\r\nthe middle of June, earlier or later, according to latitude and season.\r\nThe ends of twigs on which the eggs are laid in bunches of hundreds (see\r\nfigure), may be cut off in the fall and destroyed. As this can be done\r\nwith pruning-shears, it may be an economical method of destroying them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Caterpillar Eggs. Canker-worm Moths, Male and Female.]\r\n\r\n_Canker-worm._--The male moth has pale-ash colored wings, with a black\r\ndot, and is about an inch across. The female has no wings, is oval in\r\nform, dark-ash colored above, and gray underneath. These rise from the\r\nground as early in spring as the frost is out. Some few rise in the\r\nfall. The females travel slowly up the body of the tree, while the\r\nwinged males fly about to pair with them. Soon you may discover the eggs\r\nlaid, always in rows, in forks of branches and among the young twigs.\r\nEvery female lays nearly a hundred, and covers them over carefully with\r\na transparent, waterproof glue. The eggs hatch from May 1st to June 1st,\r\naccording to the latitude and season, and come out an ash-colored worm\r\nwith a yellow stripe. They are very voracious, sometimes entirely\r\nstripping an orchard of its foliage. At the end of about four weeks\r\nthey descend to the ground, to remain in a chrysalis state, about four\r\ninches below the surface, until the following spring. These worms are\r\nvery destructive in some parts of New England, and have been already\r\nvery annoying, as far west as Iowa. They will be likely to be\r\ntransported all over the country on young trees. Many remedies are\r\nproposed, but to present them all is only to confuse. The best of\r\nanything is sufficient. We present two, for the benefit of two classes\r\nof persons. For all who have care enough to attend to it, the best\r\nremedy is to bind a handful of straw around the tree, two feet from the\r\nground, tied on with one band, and the ends allowed to stand out from\r\nthe tree. The females, who can not fly, but only ascend the trunk by\r\ncrawling, will get up under the straw, and may easily be killed, by\r\nstriking a covered mallet on the straw, and against the tree below the\r\nband. This should be attended to every day during the short season of\r\ntheir ascent, and all will be destroyed. Burn the straw about the last\r\nof May. But those who are too indolent or busy to do this often till\r\ntheir season is past, may melt India-rubber over a hot fire, and smear\r\nbandages of cloth or leather previously put tight around the tree. This\r\nwill prevent the female moth from crossing and reaching the limbs. Tar\r\nis used, but India-rubber is better, as weather will not injure it as it\r\nwill tar, so as to allow the moth to pass over. Put this on early and\r\nwell, and let it remain till the last of May. But the first, the process\r\nof killing them, is far the best.\r\n\r\n_Gathering-and preserving._--All fruit, designed to be kept even for a\r\nfew weeks, should be picked, and not shaken off, and laid, not dropped\r\ninto a basket, and with equal care put into the barrels in which it is\r\nto be kept or transported. The barrel should be slightly shaken and\r\nfilled entirely full. Let it stand open two days, to allow the fruit to\r\nsweat and throw off the excessive moisture. Then head up tight, and keep\r\nin a cool open shed until freezing weather; then keep where they can\r\noccasionally have good air, and in as cool a place as possible, without\r\ndanger of freezing. Of all the methods of keeping apples on shelves,\r\nburied as potatoes, in various other articles, as chaff, sawdust, &c.,\r\nthis is, on the whole, the best and cheapest. Wrapping the apples in\r\npaper before putting them into the barrels, may be an improvement.\r\nApples gathered just before hard frosts, or as they are beginning to\r\nripen, but before many have fallen from the trees, and packed as above,\r\nand the barrels laid on their sides in a good dry, dark cellar, where\r\nair can occasionally be admitted, can be kept in perfection from six to\r\neight weeks, after the ordinary time for their decay. Apples for cider,\r\nor other immediate use, may be shaken off upon mats or blankets spread\r\nunder the tree for that purpose. They are not quite so valuable, but it\r\nsaves times in gathering.\r\n\r\n_Varieties_ are exceedingly numerous and uncertain. Cole estimates that\r\ntwo millions of varieties have been produced in the single state of\r\nMaine, and that thousands of kinds may there be found superior to those\r\ngenerally recommended in the fruit-books. The minute description of\r\nfruits is not of the least use to one out of ten thousand cultivators.\r\nThe best pomologists differ in the names and descriptions of the various\r\nfruits. Some varieties have as many as twenty-five synonyms. Of what\r\nuse, then, is the minute description of the hundred and seventy-seven\r\nvarieties of Cole's American fruit-book, or of the vast numbers\r\ndescribed by Downing, Elliott, Barry, and Hooper? The best pear we saw\r\nin Illinois could not be identified in Elliott's fruit-book by a\r\npractical fruit-grower. We had in our orchard in Ohio a single\r\napple-tree, producing a large yield of one of the very best apples we\r\never saw; it was called Natural Beauty. We could not learn from the\r\nfruit-books what it was. We took it to an amateur cultivator of thirty\r\nyears' experience, and he could not identify it. This is a fair view of\r\nthe condition of the nomenclature of fruits. The London experimental\r\ngardens are doing much to systemize it, and the most scientific growers\r\nare congratulating them on their success. But it never can be any better\r\nthan it is now. Varieties will increase more and more rapidly, and\r\nsynonyms will be multiplied annually, and the modification of varieties\r\nby stocks, manures, climates, and location, will render it more and more\r\nconfused.\r\n\r\nWe can depend only upon our nurserymen to collect all improved\r\nvarieties, and where we do not see the bearing-trees for ourselves,\r\ntrust the nurseryman's description of the general qualities of fruit.\r\nSeldom, indeed, will a cultivator buy fruit-trees, and set out his\r\norchard, and master the descriptions in the fruit-books, and after his\r\ntrees come into bearing, minutely try them by all the marks to see\r\nwhether he has been cheated, and, if so, take up the trees and put out\r\nothers, to go the same round again, perhaps with no better success.\r\nHence, if possible, let planters get trees from a nursery so near at\r\nhand that they may know the quality of the fruit of the trees from which\r\nthe grafts are taken, get the most popular in their vicinity, and\r\nalways secure a few scions from any extraordinary apple they may chance\r\nto taste. It is well, also, to deal only with the most honorable\r\nnurserymen. Remember that varieties will not do alike well in all\r\nlocalities. Many need acclimation. Every extensive cultivator should\r\nkeep seedlings growing, with a view to new varieties, or modifications\r\nof old ones, adapted to his locality.\r\n\r\nWe did think of describing minutely a few of the best varieties, adapted\r\nto the different seasons of the year. But we can see no advantage it\r\nwould be to the great mass of cultivators, for whom this book is\r\ndesigned. Those who wish to acquaint themselves with those descriptions\r\nwill purchase some of the best fruit-books. We shall content ourselves\r\nwith giving the lists, recommended by the best authority, for different\r\nsections, followed by a general description of the _qualities_ of a few\r\nof the best. Downing's lists are the following:--\r\n\r\nAPPLES FOR MIDDLE AND SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE EASTERN STATES, RIPENING\r\nIN SUCCESSION.\r\n\r\n  Early Harvest.

Camack's Sweet.\r\n\r\nSome varieties are included in all these lists, showing that the best\r\ncultivators regard some of our finest apples as adapted to all parts of\r\nthe country. A careful comparison of Hooper's lists, as recommended by\r\nthe best Western cultivators, whose names are there mentioned, will show\r\nthat they name the same best varieties, with a few additions.\r\n\r\nWe have carefully examined the varieties recommended by Ernst, by\r\nKirtland and Elliott, by Barry, and by the national convention of\r\nfruit-growers, and find a general agreement on the main varieties. There\r\nare some differences of opinion, but they are minor. They have left out\r\nsome of Downing's list, and added some, as a matter of course. All this\r\nonly goes to show the established character of our main varieties. Out\r\nof all these, select a dozen of those named, in most of the lists, and\r\nyou will have all that ever need be cultivated for profit. The best six\r\nmight be still better. Yet, in your localities, you will find good ones\r\nnot named in the books, and new ones will be constantly rising.\r\n\r\nDowning adds that \"Newtown Pippin does not succeed generally at the\r\nWest, yet in some locations they are very fine. Rhode Island Greening\r\nand Baldwin generally fail in many sections, while in others they are\r\nexcellent.\"\r\n\r\nNow, it is contrary to all laws of vegetation and climate, that a given\r\nfruit should be good in one county and useless in the next, if they have\r\nan equal chance in each place. A suitable preparation of the soil, in\r\nsupplying, in the specific manures, what it may lack, getting scions\r\nfrom equally healthy trees, and grafting upon healthy apple-seedling\r\nstocks--observing our principles of acclimation--_and not one of our\r\nbest apples will fail, in any part of North America_.\r\n\r\nOn a given parallel of latitude, a man may happen to plant a tree upon a\r\nfine calcareous soil, and it does well. Another chances to plant one\r\nupon a soil of a different character, and it does not succeed. It is\r\nthen proclaimed that fruit succeeds well in one locality, and is useless\r\nin another near by and in the same latitude. The truth is, had the\r\nlatter supplied calcareous substances to his deficient soil, as he might\r\neasily have done, in bones, plaster, lime, &c., the fruit would have\r\ndone equally well in both cases. We should like to see this subject\r\ndiscussed, as it never has been in any work that has come under our\r\nobservation. It would redeem many a section from a bad reputation for\r\nfruit-growing, and add much to the luxuries of thousands of our\r\ncitizens. Apples can be successfully and profitably grown on every farm\r\nof arable land in North America. We present, in the following cuts, a\r\nfew of our best apples, in their usual size and form. Some are\r\ncontracted for the want of room on the page. We shall describe a few\r\nvarieties, in our opinion the best of any grown in this country. These\r\nare all that need be cultivated, and may be adapted to all localities.\r\nWe lay aside all technical terms in our description, which we give, not\r\nfor purposes of identification, but to show their true value for\r\nprofitable culture. The quality of fruit, habits of the tree, and time\r\nof maturity, are all that are necessary, for any practical purpose.\r\n\r\nNICKAJACK.--_Synonyms_--Wonder, Summerour.\r\n\r\nOrigin, North Carolina. Tree vigorous, and a constant prolific bearer.\r\nFruit large, skin yellowish, shaded land striped with crimson, and\r\nsprinkled with lightish dots.

Season, November to April.\r\n\r\nBALDWIN.--_Synonyms_--Late Baldwin, Woodpecker, Pecker, Steele's Red\r\nWinter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nStands at the head of all apples, in the Boston market. Fruit large and\r\nhandsome. Tree hardy, and an abundant bearer. It is of the family of\r\nEsopus Spitzenburg. Yellowish white flesh, crisp and beautiful flavor,\r\nfrom a mingling of the acid and saccharine. Season, from November to\r\nMarch. On some rich western soils, it is disposed to bitter rot, which\r\nmay be easily prevented, by application to the soil of lime and potash.\r\n\r\nCANADA RED.--_Synonyms_--Old Nonsuch, Richfield Nonsuch, Steele's Red\r\nWinter.\r\n\r\nAn old fruit in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Tree not a great grower,\r\nbut a profuse bearer. Good in Ohio, Michigan, and other Western states.\r\nRetains its fine flavor to the last. January to May.\r\n\r\nBELLFLOWER.--_Synonyms_--Yellow Bellflower, Lady Washington, Yellow\r\nBelle-fleur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFruit very large, pale lemon yellow, with a blush in the sun. Subacid,\r\njuicy, crisp flesh. Tree vigorous, regular and excellent bearer. Season,\r\nNovember to March. Highly valuable.\r\n\r\nEARLY HARVEST.--_Synonyms_--Early French Reinette, Prince's Harvest,\r\nJuly Pippin, Yellow Harvest, Large White Juneating, Tart Bough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe best early apple. Bright straw color. Subacid, white, tender, juicy,\r\nand crisp. Equally good for cooking and the dessert. Season, the whole\r\nmonth of July in central New York; earlier south, and later north, as of\r\nall other varieties.\r\n\r\nRED ASTRACHAN.--Brought to England from Sweden in 1816. One of the most\r\nbeautiful apples in the whole list. Fruit very large, and very smooth\r\nand fair. Color deep crimson, with a little greenish yellow in the shade\r\nand occasionally a little russet near the stalk. Flesh white and crisp,\r\nrich acid flavor. Gather as soon as nearly ripe, or it will become\r\nmealy. Abundant bearer. July and August.\r\n\r\nESOPUS SPITZENBURG.--_Synonym_--True Spitzenburg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLarge, fine flavored, lively red fruit. It is everywhere well known, as\r\none of the very best apples ever cultivated, both for cooking and the\r\ndesert. December to February, and often good even into April. A very\r\ngreat bearer.\r\n\r\nKING OF TOMPKINS COUNTY.--_Synonym_--King Apple.\r\n\r\nThis is an abundant annual bearer. Skin rather yellowish, shaded with\r\nred and striped with crimson. Flesh rather coarse, but juicy and tender,\r\nwith a very agreeable vinous aromatic flavor. One of the best. December\r\nand March.\r\n\r\nRHODE ISLAND GREENING.--_Synonyms_--Burlington Greening, Jersey\r\nGreening, Hampshire Greening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA universal favorite, everywhere known. Acid, lively, aromatic,\r\nexcellent alike for the dessert and kitchen. Great bearer. November to\r\nMarch. It is said to fail on some rich alluvial soils at the West. Avoid\r\nroot grafting, and apply the specific manures, and we will warrant it\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nBONUM.--_Synonym_--Magnum Bonum.\r\n\r\nFrom North Carolina. Fruit large, from light to dark red. Flesh yellow,\r\nsubacid, rich, and delicious. Tree hardy, vigorous, and an early and\r\nabundant bearer.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN GOLDEN RUSSET.--_Synonyms_--Sheep Nose, Golden Russet,\r\nBullock's Pippin, Little Pearmain.\r\n\r\nThe English Golden Russet is a variety cultivated in this country, but\r\nmuch inferior to the above. The fruit is small, but melting juicy, with\r\na very pleasant flavor. It is one of the most regular and abundant\r\nbearers known. Tree hardy and thrifty. October to January. We know from\r\nraising and using it at the West, that it is one of the very best.\r\n\r\nPIPPIN, FALL.--Confounded with Holland Pippin and several other\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA noble fruit, unsurpassed by any other autumn apple. Very large,\r\nequally adapted to table and kitchen. Fine yellow, when fully ripe, with\r\na few dots. Flesh is white, mellow, and richly aromatic. October and\r\nDecember. A fair bearer, though not so great as many others.\r\n\r\nNEWTOWN PIPPIN.--_Synonyms_--Green Newtown Pippin, Green Winter Pippin,\r\nAmerican Newtown Pippin, Petersburg Pippin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis is put down as the first of all apples. It commands the highest\r\nprice, in the London market. It keeps long without the least shriveling\r\nor loss of flavor. Fruit medium size, olive green, with small gray\r\nspecks. Flesh greenish white, juicy, crisp, and of an exceedingly\r\ndelicious flavor. _The best keeping apple_, good for eating from\r\nDecember to May.\r\n\r\nThe yellow pippin, is another variety nearly as good.\r\n\r\nPORTER.--A Massachusetts fruit, very fair; a very great bearer. Is a\r\nfavorite in Boston. Deserves general cultivation. September and into\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nSMOKEHOUSE.--_Synonyms_--Mill Creek Vandevere, English Vandevere.\r\n\r\nAn old variety from Pennsylvania, where the original tree grew by a\r\ngentleman's smoke-house; hence its name. Skin yellow, shaded with\r\ncrimson, sprinkled with large gray or brown dots. September to February.\r\nOne of the very best for cooking.\r\n\r\nRAMBO.--_Synonyms_--Romanite, Bread and cheese apple, Seek-no-further.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis is a great fall apple. Medium size, flat, yellowish white in the\r\nshade, and marbled with pale yellow and red in the sun, and speckled\r\nwith large rough dots. Flesh greenish white, rich, subacid. October to\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nCANADA REINETTE.--This has ten synonyms in Europe, which indicates its\r\npopularity. In this country it is known only under the above name. Fruit\r\nof the very largest size. A good bearer. The quality is in all respects\r\ngood. Lively, subacid flavor. December to April, unless allowed to hang\r\non the tree too long. Pick early in the fall.\r\n\r\nROME BEAUTY.--_Synonyms_--Roman Beauty, Gillett's Seedling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFruit large, yellow, ground shaded, and striped with red, and sprinkled\r\nwith little dots. Flesh yellowish, juicy, tender, subacid. Bears every\r\nyear a great crop of very large showy apples. It is not superior in\r\nflesh or flavor, but keeps and sells very well. Always must be very\r\nprofitable, and hence very popular.\r\n\r\nAUTUMN SWEET BOUGH.--_Synonyms_--Late Bough, Fall Bough, Summer Bell\r\nFlower, Philadelphia Sweet.\r\n\r\nTree very vigorous and productive. Fruit medium. Skin smooth, pale\r\nyellow with a few brown dots. Flesh white, tender, sweet vinous flavor.\r\nOne of the best dessert sweet apples. August and October.\r\n\r\nWESTFIELD SEEK-NO-FURTHER.--_Synonyms_--Seek-no-further, Red Winter\r\nPearmain, Connecticut Seek-no-further.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFruit large, pale dull red, sprinkled with obscure russety yellow dots.\r\nFlesh white, tender and fine-grained. On all accounts good. October to\r\nFebruary according to Downing. Elliott says from December to February.\r\nBut the doctors often disagree. So you had better eat your apples when\r\nthey are good, whether it be October or December, or according to\r\nDowning, Elliott, or Hooper.\r\n\r\nRIBSTON PIPPIN.--_Synonyms_--Glory of York, Travers', Formosa Pippin,\r\nRock hill's Russet.\r\n\r\nThis occupies as high a place in England, as any other apple. In this\r\ncountry, two or three others, as Baldwin and Newtown Pippin, are more\r\nhighly esteemed. This is most successfully grown in the colder parts of\r\nthe United States and Canada. Fruit medium, deep yellow, firm, crisp;\r\nflavor sharp aromatic. November to April.\r\n\r\nNORTHERN SPY.--This is a new American variety, with no synonyms. It\r\noriginated near Rochester, N. Y.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere is not a better dessert apple known. It retains its exceedingly\r\npleasant juiciness, and excellent flavor from January to June. In\r\nwestern New York, they have been carried to the harvest field, in July\r\nin excellent condition. A fair bearer of beautiful fruit. Subacid with a\r\npeculiar freshness of flavor. Dark stripes of purplish red in the sun,\r\nbut a greenish pale yellow in the shade. High culture and an open top\r\nfor admission of the sun, affects the fruit more favorably than any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nROXBURY RUSSET.--_Synonyms_--Boston Russet, Putnam Russet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAn excellent fruit, and prodigious bearer. Medium size, flesh greenish\r\nwhite, rather juicy, and subacid. Good in January, and one of the best\r\nin market in June.\r\n\r\nThere are other russets of larger size, but much inferior. This should\r\nbe in every collection. It is not first in richness and flavor, but it\r\nis superior to most in productiveness, and is one of the best keepers.\r\n\r\nLARGE YELLOW BOUGH.--_Synonyms_--Early Sweet Bough, Sweet Harvest,\r\nBough.\r\n\r\nNo harvest-apple equals this, except the EARLY HARVEST. Excellent for\r\nthe dessert, but rather sweet for pies and sauce. Fruit above medium.\r\nTree a moderate grower, but a profuse bearer. Flesh white and very\r\ntender. Very sweet and sprightly. July and August. Should have a place,\r\neven in a small collection.\r\n\r\nSWAAR.--One of the best American fruits. Its name in Dutch, where it\r\noriginated on the Hudson River, means heavy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFruit is large, and when fully ripe, of a dead gold color, dotted with\r\nmany brown specks. Flesh yellowish, fine grained, and tender. Flavor\r\naromatic and exceedingly rich. Bears good crops. December to March.\r\n\r\nWINESAP.--This is one of the best apples for cider, and good also for\r\nthe table and kitchen. Fruit hangs long on the tree without injury. It\r\nis very productive, and does well on a variety of soils. Very fine in\r\nthe West. Yellow flesh, very firm, and high flavored. November to May.\r\nDeservedly, a very popular orchard variety.\r\n\r\nMAIDEN'S BLUSH.--A comparatively new variety from New Jersey. Remarkably\r\nbeautiful. Admired as a dessert fruit, and equally good for the kitchen\r\nand for drying. Clear lemon yellow, with a blush cheek, sometimes a\r\nbrilliant red cheek. Rapid growing tree, with a fine spreading head,\r\nbearing most abundantly. August and October.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLADIES' SWEETING.--The finest sweet apple, for dessert in winter, that\r\nhas yet been produced. Skin smooth and nearly covered with red, in the\r\nsun. Flesh is greenish white, very tender, juicy, and crisp. Without any\r\nshriveling or loss of flavor, it keeps till May. So good a winter and\r\nspring sweet apple is a desideratum in any orchard or garden.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are all that any practical cultivator will need. Most will\r\nselect from our list, perhaps half a dozen, which will be all they wish\r\nto cultivate. From our descriptions, which are not designed to enable\r\nplanters to identify the varieties, but to ascertain their qualities,\r\nany one can select such as he prefers. And they are so generally known,\r\nthat there will be but little danger of getting varieties, different\r\nfrom those ordered.\r\n\r\nWe subjoin, from Hooker's excellent Western Fruit-Book, the following--\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF APPLES FOR THE WESTERN STATES.\r\n\r\n\"The following list,\" says Hooker, \"contains a catalogue of the most\r\npopular varieties of apples, recommended by various pomological\r\nsocieties of the United States for the Western states.\" These varieties\r\ncan be obtained of all respectable nurserymen. The list may be of use to\r\nsome cultivators in the different states mentioned. The general\r\nqualities of the best of these will be found in our descriptions under\r\nthe cuts:--\r\n\r\n_Baldwin._--Ohio, Missouri, Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Roxbury Russet._--Michigan, Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Rhode Island Greening._--Michigan, Iowa, Ohio, Missouri, Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Swaar._--Ohio, Illinois, Michigan.\r\n\r\n_Esopus Spitzenburg._--Missouri, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio.\r\n\r\n_Early Harvest._--Virginia, Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan,\r\nIowa.\r\n\r\n_Sweet Bough._--Illinois, Virginia, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio.\r\n\r\n_Summer Rose._--Ohio, Missouri, Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Fall Pippin._--Michigan, Virginia, Ohio, Missouri, Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Belmont._--Michigan, Ohio.\r\n\r\n_Golden Sweet._--Missouri.\r\n\r\n_Red Astrachan._--Iowa, Ohio, Missouri, Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Jonathan._--Ohio, Missouri.\r\n\r\n_Early Strawberry._--Ohio.\r\n\r\n_Danvers Winter Sweet._--Ohio.\r\n\r\n_American Summer Pearmain._--Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Maiden Blush._--Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Porter._--Ohio, Missouri.\r\n\r\n_Gravenstein._--Ohio.\r\n\r\n_Vandevere._--Missouri, Indiana, Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Yellow Bellflower._--Michigan, Iowa, Virginia, Ohio, Missouri,\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\n_Fameuse._--Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Newtown Pippin._--Michigan, Iowa, Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Rambo._--Michigan, Iowa, Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Smokehouse._--Virginia, Indiana.\r\n\r\n_Fallawalden._--Ohio.\r\n\r\n_Golden Russet._--Ohio, Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Wine Sap._--Ohio, Illinois.\r\n\r\n_White Bellflower._--Missouri, Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Holland Pippin._--Michigan, Missouri, Indiana.\r\n\r\n_Raule's Janet._--Iowa, Virginia, Illinois.\r\n\r\n_Lady Apple._--Ohio, Missouri.\r\n\r\nFor the value of these varieties, in the states mentioned, you have the\r\nauthority of the best pomological societies. The several states are\r\nmentioned so frequently, that it will be seen that most of them are\r\nadapted to all the states. Attend to acclimation and manure, and guard\r\nagainst insects, and they will all flourish, in all parts of the West\r\nand of the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRICOT.\r\n\r\nThis is a fruit about half-way between a peach and a plum. The stone is\r\nlike the plum, and the flesh rather more like the peach. It is esteemed,\r\nprincipally, because it comes earlier in the season than anything else\r\nof the kind.\r\n\r\nIt is used as a dessert-fruit, for preserving, drying, and various\r\npurposes in cookery. It does well on plum-stock, and best in good deep,\r\nmoist loam, manured as the peach and plum. The best varieties produce\r\ntheir like from the seed. Seedlings are more hardy than any grafted\r\ntrees. Grafts on plums are much better than on the peach. The latter\r\nseldom produce good hardy, thrifty trees, although many persist in\r\ntrying them. The apricot is a favorite tree for espalier training\r\nagainst walls and fences, in small yards, where it bears luxuriantly. It\r\nalso makes a good handsome standard tree for open cultivation.\r\n\r\nIt is as much exposed to depredations from curculio as the plum, and\r\nmust be treated in the same way. Cultivation same as peach. It produces\r\nits fruit, like the peach, only on wood of the previous year's growth;\r\nhence it must be pruned like the peach. Especially must it be headed in\r\nwell, to secure the best crop.\r\n\r\n_Varieties_ are quite numerous, a few of which only deserve\r\ncultivation. Any of the nine following varieties are good:--\r\n\r\nBROWN'S EARLY.--Yellow, with red cheek. A very productive, great grower.\r\n\r\nNEWHALL'S EARLY.--Bright-orange color, with deep-red cheek. A good\r\ncling-stone variety, every way worthy of cultivation.\r\n\r\nMOORPARK.--Yellow, with ruddy cheek. An enormous bearer, though of slow\r\ngrowth. It is a freestone variety of English origin, and needing a\r\nlittle protection in our colder latitudes.\r\n\r\nDUBOIS' EARLY GOLDEN.--Color, pale-orange. Very hardy and productive. In\r\n1846, the original tree at Fishkill, N. Y., bore ninety dollars' worth\r\nof fruit.\r\n\r\nLARGE EARLY.--Orange, but red in the sun. An excellent, early,\r\nproductive variety.\r\n\r\nHEMSKIRKE.--Bright-orange, with red cheek. An English variety, vigorous\r\ntree, and good bearer.\r\n\r\nPEACH.--Yellow, with deep-brown on the sun-side. An excellent French\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nBREDA.--Deep-orange, with blush spots in the sun. A vigorous,\r\nproductive, African variety.\r\n\r\nROMAN.--Pale-yellow, with occasionally red dots. Good for northern\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\nFrom these, planters may select those that best suit their localities\r\nand fancy. They are a little liable to be frost-bitten in the blossoms,\r\nas they bloom very early. Otherwise they are always very productive.\r\nThey are ornamental, both in the leaf and in the blossom. Eaten plain,\r\nbefore thoroughly ripe, they are not healthy; otherwise, harmless and\r\ndelicious. Every garden should have half a dozen.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICHOKE.\r\n\r\nThere are two plants known by this name. The Jerusalem artichoke, so\r\ncalled, not from Jerusalem in Palestine, but a corruption of the Italian\r\nname which signifies the tuber-rooted sunflower. The tubers are only\r\nused for pickling. They make a very indigestible pickle, and the plant\r\nis injurious to the garden, so they had better not be raised.\r\n\r\nThe artichoke proper grows something like a thistle, bearing certain\r\nheads, that, at a particular stage of their growth, are fine for food.\r\n\r\nThe soil should be prepared as for asparagus, only fifteen inches deep\r\nwill do well. The plot of ground should be where the water will not\r\nstand on it at any time in the winter, as it will on most level gardens.\r\nThis will kill the roots. When a new bed is made with slips from old\r\nplants, carefully separate vigorous shoots, remove superfluous leaves,\r\nplant five inches deep in rows five feet apart, and two feet apart in\r\nthe rows. Keep very clean of weeds. The first year, some pretty good,\r\nthough not full-sized heads will be produced. Plant fresh beds each\r\nyear, and you will have good heads from July to November. Small heads\r\nwill grow out along the stalk like the sunflower. Remove most of these\r\nsmall ones when they are about the size of hens' eggs, and the others\r\nwill grow large. When the scales begin to diverge, but before the\r\nblossoms come out, is the time to cut them for use. Lay brush over them\r\nto prevent suffocation, and cover with straw in winter, to protect from\r\nseverest cold. Too much warmth, however, is more injurious than frost.\r\n\r\nSpring-dress much like asparagus. Remove from each plant all the stocks\r\nbut two or three of the best. Those removed are good for a new bed. A\r\nbed, properly made, will last four or five years.\r\n\r\nTo save seed, bend down a few good heads, so as to prevent water from\r\nstanding in them; tie them to a stake, until the seed is matured. But,\r\nlike Early York cabbage, imported seed is better. The usual way of\r\nserving them is, the full heads boiled. In Italy the small heads are cut\r\nup, with oil, salt, and pepper. This vegetable would be a valuable\r\naccession to American kitchen gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\nASHES.\r\n\r\nAre one of the best applications to the soil, for almost all plants.\r\nLeeched ashes are a valuable manure, but not equal to unleached. Few\r\narticles about a house or farm should be saved with greater care. Be as\r\nchoice of them as of your small change. They are worth three times as\r\nmuch on the land as they can be sold for other purposes. On corn, at\r\nfirst hoeing, they are nearly equal to plaster. On onions and vines,\r\nthey promote the growth and keep off the insects. Sprinkle on dry, when\r\nplants are damp, but not too wet. Do not put wet ashes on plants, or\r\nwater while the ashes are on. It will kill them. Mix ashes and plaster\r\nwith other manures, and their power will be greatly increased. Mixed in\r\nmanure of hot-beds, they accelerate the heat. On sour land they are\r\nequal to lime for correcting the acidity.\r\n\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS.\r\n\r\nThis is a universal favorite in the vegetable garden. By the application\r\nof sand and compost, the soil should be kept loose, to allow the sprouts\r\nto spring easily from the crowns. Propagation is best effected by seed,\r\ntransplanting after one year's growth. Older roots divided and\r\ntransplanted are of some value, but not equal to young roots, nor will\r\nthey last as long.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the soil_ for an asparagus-bed is most important to\r\nsuccess. Dig a trench on one edge of the plat designed for the bed, and\r\nthe length of it, eighteen inches wide and two feet deep. Put in the\r\nbottom one foot of good barn-yard manure, and tread down. Then spade\r\neighteen inches more, by the side of and as deep as the other, throwing\r\nthe soil upon the manure in the trench. Fill with manure and proceed as\r\nbefore, and so until the whole plat has been trenched; then wheel the\r\nearth from the first ditch to the other side and fill into the last\r\ntrench, thus making all level. If there is danger that water will stand\r\nin the bottom, drain by a blind ditch. If this is objected to as too\r\nexpensive, let it be remembered that such a bed, with a little annual\r\ntop-dressing, will be good for twenty years, which is the age at which\r\nasparagus-plants begin to deteriorate; then a new bed should be ready to\r\ntake its place.\r\n\r\n_Planting._--Mark the plat into beds five feet wide, leaving paths two\r\nfeet wide between them. In each bed put four rows lengthwise, which will\r\nbe just fifteen inches apart, and set plants fifteen inches apart in the\r\nrow. Dig a trench six inches wide and six inches deep for each row; put\r\nan inch of rich mould in the bottom; set the plants on the mould, with\r\nthe roots spread naturally, with the ends pointing a little downward. Be\r\nvery particular about the position of the roots. Fill the trench, and\r\nround it up a little with well-mixed soil and fine manure. The bed is\r\nthen perfect, and will improve for many years.\r\n\r\n_After-Culture._--In the fall, after the frost has killed the stalks,\r\ncut them down and burn them on the bed. Cover the bed with fine rotted\r\nmanure, to the depth of two inches, and one half-bushel salt to each\r\nsquare rod. As soon as frost is out in spring, with a fork work the\r\ntop-dressing into the soil to the depth of four inches, and stir the\r\nsoil to the depth of eight inches between the rows, using care not to\r\ntouch the crowns of the roots with the fork.\r\n\r\n_Cutting_ should never be performed until the third year. Set out the\r\nplants when one year old, let them grow one year in the bed, and the\r\nnext year they will be fit to cut. Cut all the shoots at a suitable age,\r\nup to the last days of June. The shoots should be regularly cut just\r\nbelow the surface, when they are four or six inches high. If you are\r\ntempted to cut after the 25th of June, leave two or three thrifty shoots\r\nto each root, to grow up for seed, or you will weaken the plants, and\r\nthey will die in winter. This is the reason why so many vacancies are\r\nseen in many asparagus beds. This plant may be forced in hotbeds, so as\r\nto yield an abundance of good shoots long before they will start in the\r\nopen air, affording an early luxury to those who can afford it.\r\n\r\nThis vegetable is equal or superior to green peas, and by taking all the\r\npains recommended above, in the beginning, an abundance can be raised\r\nfor twenty years, on the same bed, at a very trifling cost. Early\r\nradishes and other vegetables can be raised, between the rows, without\r\nany harm to the asparagus.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALM.\r\n\r\nThis is a medicinal plant, very useful, and easily raised. A strong\r\ninfusion of the leaves, drank freely for some time by a nervous,\r\nhypochondriacal person, is, perhaps, better than any other medicine. It\r\nis also good in flatulency and fevers.\r\n\r\nIts _propagation_ is by slips or roots. It is perennial, affording a\r\nsupply for many years. Gather just as the blossoms are appearing, and\r\ndry quickly in a slow oven, or in the shade. Press and do up in white\r\npapers, and keep in a tight, dry drawer, until needed for use.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARBERRY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Barberries.]\r\n\r\nA prickly shrub, from five to ten feet high, growing wild in this\r\ncountry and in Europe, on poor, hard soils, or in moist situations, by\r\nwalls, stones, or fences.\r\n\r\nIts _propagation_ is by seeds, suckers, or offshoots.\r\n\r\nThis shrub is used for jellies, tarts, pickles, &c. Preserves made of\r\nequal parts of barberry and sweet apples, or outer-part of fine\r\nwater-melons, are very superior. It is also one of the best shrubs for\r\nhedge.\r\n\r\nThe bark has much of the tannin principle, and with the wood, is used\r\nfor coloring yellow. Shrub, blossoms, and fruit, are quite ornamental,\r\nforming a beautiful hedge, but rather inclined to spread. Will do well\r\non any land and in any situation. The discussion in New England about\r\nits blasting contiguous fields of grain, is about as sensible as the old\r\nwitchcraft mania. Every garden should have two or three.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARLEY.\r\n\r\nDoes best on land which was hoed the previous year. If properly tilled,\r\nsuch land is rich, free from weeds, and easily pulverized. Sod, plowed\r\ndeep in the fall, rolled early in the spring, well harrowed, the seed\r\nsown and harrowed in, and all rolled level, will produce a good crop.\r\nTwo bushels of seed should be sowed on an acre, unless the land be very\r\nrich; in that case, one half-bushel less. Essential to a good crop is\r\nrain about the time of heading and filling. Hence early sowing is always\r\nsurest. In many parts of the country it is of little use to sow barley,\r\nunless it be gotten in VERY EARLY. In not more than one season in twelve\r\ncan you get a good crop of barley from late sowing in all the middle and\r\nwestern states. Barley is more favorably affected than any other grain,\r\nby soaking twenty-four hours before sowing, and mixing with dry ashes. A\r\nweak solution of nitre is best for soaking the seed.\r\n\r\n_Varieties_ are two, four, and six rowed. The two-rowed grows the\r\ntallest, and is most conveniently harvested. It is controverted whether\r\nthe six-rowed variety yields the largest crop to the acre. If the\r\nweather be dry, and the worms attack the young plants, rolling when two\r\nor three inches high, with a heavy roller, will save and increase the\r\ncrop. Rolling is a great help to the harvesting, as it levels the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n_Harvesting_ should always be attended to just as it turns, but by all\r\nmeans before the straw becomes dry. If it stands up, cut with cradle or\r\nreaper, and bind. If lodged, cut with a scythe, and cure in small cocks\r\nlike clover. Standing until very ripe, or lying scattered until quite\r\ndry, is very wasteful.\r\n\r\n_Products_ are all the way from fifteen to seventy bushels to the acre,\r\naccording to season and cultivation. Reasonable care will secure an\r\naverage annual crop of forty-five or fifty bushels per acre, which makes\r\nit a profitable crop while the demand continues. It is a good crop for\r\nground feed for all animals, the beards being a little troublesome when\r\nfed whole. The straw is one of the very best for animals. Barley\r\nrequires the use of the land only ninety days, leaving it in good\r\ncondition for fall-grain.\r\n\r\n_Used_ for malting, and for food for men and beasts. It makes handsome\r\nflour and good bread. Hulled, it is a better article of food than rice.\r\n\r\nIt succeeds well on land not stiff and tenacious enough for wheat, or\r\nmoist and cool enough for oats. If farmers should raise only for malt,\r\nthe nation would become drunk and poor on beer, and the market would be\r\nruined. But raised as food, it is one of the most profitable\r\nagricultural products.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARNS.\r\n\r\nA barn should always front the north. The yard for stock should be on\r\nthe south side, with tight fences for protection on the east and west.\r\nAs this is designed for winter use, it is a great saving of comfort to\r\nthe creatures. The barn-yard should be hollowed out by excavation, until\r\nfour or five feet lower in the centre than on the edges. The border\r\nshould be nearly level, inclining slightly toward the centre, to allow\r\nthe liquid in the yard to run into it for purposes of manure. The front\r\nof a barn should be on the summit of a small rise of ground, to allow\r\nwater to run away from the door, to prevent mud. In hilly countries it\r\nis very convenient to build barns by hills, so as to allow hay and grain\r\nto be drawn in near the top, and be thrown down, instead of being\r\npitched up. These general principles are sufficient for all ordinary\r\nbarns. Those who are able to build expensive barns had better build them\r\ncircular, eight or sixteen square, and one hundred feet in diameter--the\r\nlower part, to top of stable, of stone. Let the stable extend all around\r\nnext to the wall, and a floor over the stable, that teams may be driven\r\nall around to pitch into the bays, and upon the mows and scaffolds, at\r\nevery point. Thus teams may go round and out the door at which they\r\nentered. Such a floor will accommodate several teams at the same time.\r\nThe cellar should be in the centre, surrounded by the stable. Such a\r\ncellar would never freeze, and would hold roots enough for one hundred\r\nhead of cattle, which the stable would easily accommodate. Let the\r\nmangers be around next the cellar, for convenience of feeding. Such a\r\nbarn would be more convenient for a dairy of one hundred cows, or for\r\nwinter-fattening of cattle, than any other form. It would cost no more\r\nthan many barns in western New York that are not half as convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEANS.\r\n\r\nThese are divided into two classes--pole and bush beans. They are\r\nsubdivided into many varieties. We omit the English, or horse-bean, as\r\nbeing less valuable, for any purpose, than our well-known beans or peas.\r\nPole beans are troublesome to raise, and are only grown on account of\r\nexcellence of quality, and to have successive gatherings from the same\r\nvines. Pole beans are only used for horticultural purposes.\r\n\r\n_Field-Beans._--For general culture there are three varieties of\r\nwhite--small, medium, and large. Of all known beans, we prefer the\r\nmedium white. The China bean, white with a red face, is an early\r\nvariety. All ripen nearly at the same time. It cooks almost as soon as a\r\npotato, and is good for the table; but it is less productive, and less\r\nsaleable because not wholly white. For planting among corn, as for a\r\nvery late crop, this bean is valuable, because it matures in so short a\r\ntime. Good beans may be raised among corn, without injury to the\r\ncorn-crop. This can only be done when it is designed to cultivate the\r\ncorn but one way. Many fail in attempts to grow beans among corn, by\r\nplanting them at first hoeing. The corn, having so much the start, will\r\nshade the beans and nearly destroy them. But plant at the same time of\r\nthe corn, and they will mature before the corn will shade them much, and\r\nnot be in the way even of the ordinary crop of pumpkins. But\r\ndouble-cropping land in this way, at any time, is of very doubtful\r\nutility. A separate plat of ground for each crop, in nearly all cases,\r\nis the most economical. To raise a good crop of beans, prepare the soil\r\nas thoroughly as for any other crop. Beans will mature on land so poor\r\nand hard as to be almost worthless for other crops. But a rich, mellow\r\nsoil is as good for beans as anything else, though not so indispensable.\r\nDrill in with a planter as near together as possible, and allow a\r\ncultivator to pass between them. One bushel to the acre on ordinary\r\nland, and three fourths of a bushel on very rich land, is about the\r\nquantity of seed requisite. Hoe and cultivate them while young. Late\r\ncultivation is useless--more so than on most other crops. Beans should\r\nnot be much hilled in hoeing, and should never be worked when wet. All\r\nplants with a rough stalk, like the bean, potato, and vine, are greatly\r\ninjured, sometimes ruined, by having the earth stirred around them when\r\nthey are wet, or even damp. Beans are usually pulled; this should be\r\ndone when the latest pods are full-grown, but not dry. Place them in\r\nsmall bunches on the ground with the roots up. If the weather be dry,\r\nthey need not be moved until time to draw them in. If the weather be\r\ndamp, they should be stacked loosely in small stacks around poles, and\r\ncovered with straw on the top, to shed rain. Always haul in when very\r\ndry. Avoid stacking if possible, for they are always wasted rapidly by\r\nmoving. In drawing in, keep the rack under them covered with blankets to\r\nsave those that shell.\r\n\r\nIn pulling beans, be sure and take hold below the pods, otherwise the\r\npods will crack; and although no harm appears then to be done, yet, when\r\nthey dry, every pod that has been squeezed by pulling, will turn wrong\r\nside out, and the contents be wasted. If your beans are part ripe and\r\nthe remainder green, and it is necessary to pull them to save the early\r\nones, or guard against frost, when the ripe ones are dry, thrash them\r\nlightly. This will shell all the ripe ones, and none of the green ones.\r\nPut the straw upon a scaffold and thrash again in winter. Thus you will\r\nsave all, and have beautiful beans. Bean-straw should always be kept dry\r\nfor sheep in winter; it is equal to hay.\r\n\r\n_Garden-Beans._--There are many varieties, a few of which only should be\r\ncultivated. Having the best, there is no object in raising an inferior\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nThe best early string-bean is the Early Mohawk; it will stand a pretty\r\nsmart spring-frost without injury; comes early, and is good. Early\r\nYellow, Early Black, and Quaker, or dun-colored, are also early and\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nRefugee, or Thousand-to-one, are the best string-beans known; have a\r\nround, crisp, full, succulent pod; come as soon as the Mohawks are out\r\nof the way; and are very productive. Planted in August, they are\r\nexcellent until frost; the very best for pickling. For an early\r\nshell-bean we recommend the China red-face; the white kidney and\r\nnumerous other varieties are less certain and productive.\r\n\r\n_Running Beans_ are numerous. The true Lima, very large, greenish, when\r\nripe and dry, is the richest bean known; is nearly as good in winter,\r\ncooked in the same way, as when shelled green. They are very productive,\r\ncontinuing in blossom till killed by frost. In warm countries they grow\r\nfor years, making a tree, or growing like a large grapevine.\r\n\r\nThe London Horticultural--called also Speckled Cranberry, and Wild\r\nGoose--is a very rich variety. The only objection is the difficulty of\r\nshelling; one only can be removed at once, because of the tenderness of\r\nthe pod. The Carolina or butter bean often passes for the Lima. It has\r\nsimilar pods, the bean is of similar shape, but always white, instead of\r\ngreenish like the Lima, and smaller, earlier, and of inferior quality.\r\nThe Scarlet Runner, formerly only grown as an ornament on account of its\r\ngreat profusion of scarlet blossoms continuing until frost, is a very\r\nproductive variety; pods very large and very succulent, making an\r\nexcellent string-bean; a rich variety when dry, but objectionable on\r\naccount of their dark color. The Red and the White Cranberries, Dutch\r\nCaseknife, and many other varieties, have good qualities, but are\r\ninferior to those mentioned above. Beans may be forwarded in hotbeds, by\r\nplanting on sods six inches square, put bottom-up on the hotbed, and\r\ncovered with fine mould; plant four beans on each sod; when frost is\r\ngone, remove the sod in the hill beside the pole, previously set, leave\r\nonly two pole-beans to grow in a hill; they will always produce more\r\nthan a greater number. A shrub six feet high, with the branches on, is\r\nbetter than a pole for any running bean; nearly twice as many will grow\r\non a bush as on a pole. Use a crowbar for setting poles, or drive a\r\nstake down first, and set poles very deep, or they will blow down and\r\ndestroy the beans.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEES AND BEEHIVES.\r\n\r\nThe study of the honey-bee has been pursued with interest from remote\r\nages. A work on bees, by De Montfort, published at Antwerp in 1649,\r\nestimates the number of treatises on this subject, before his time, at\r\nbetween five and six hundred. As that was two hundred and eight years\r\nago, the number has probably increased to two thousand or more. We have\r\nsome knowledge of the character of these early works, as far back as\r\nDemocritus, four hundred and sixty years before the Christian era. The\r\ngreat men of antiquity gave particular attention to study and writing on\r\nthe honey-bee.--Among them we notice Aristotle, Plato, Columella, Pliny,\r\nand Virgil. At a later period, we have Huber, Swammerdam, Warder,\r\nWildman, _&c._ In our own day, we have Huish, Miner, Quinby, Weeks,\r\nRichardson, Langstroth, and a host of others. For the first two thousand\r\nyears from the date of these works, the bee was treated mainly as a\r\ncurious insect, rather than as a source of profit and luxury to man. And\r\nalthough Palestine was eulogized as a land flowing with milk and honey,\r\nbefore the Hebrews took possession of it, yet the science of\r\n_bee-culture_ was wholly unknown.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest attention to bees, they were supposed to originate in\r\nthe concentrated aroma of the sweetest and most beautiful flowers.\r\nVirgil, and others of his time, supposed them to come from the carcasses\r\nof dead animals. But the remarkable experiments of Huber, sixty years\r\nago, developed many facts respecting their origin and economy.\r\nSubsequent observers have added still more to the stock of our knowledge\r\nrespecting these wonderful creatures. The different stages of growth,\r\nfrom the minute egg of the queen to a full grown bee, and the precise\r\ntime occupied by each, are well established. The three classes of bees,\r\nin every perfect colony, and the offices of each; their mechanical skill\r\nin constructing the different sized and shaped cells, for honey, for\r\nraising drones, workers, and queens, all differing according to the\r\npurposes for which they are intended; the wars of the queens, and their\r\nsovereignty over their respective colonies; the methods by which\r\nworking-bees will raise a young queen, when the old one is destroyed,\r\nout of the larvae of common bees; the peculiar construction and\r\nsituation of the queen cells; and, above all, the royal jelly (differing\r\nfrom everything else in the hive) which they manufacture for the food of\r\nyoung queens; the manner in which they ventilate their hives by a swift\r\nmotion of their wings, causing the buzzing noise they make in a summer\r\nevening; their method of repairing broken comb, and building\r\nfortifications, before their entrances, at certain times, to keep out\r\nthe sphinx--all these curious matters are treated fully in many of our\r\nworks on bees. But we must forego the pleasure of presenting these at\r\nlength, it being our sole object to enable all who follow our\r\ndirections, so to manage bees as to render them profitable. In preparing\r\nthe brief directions that follow, we have most carefully studied all the\r\nworks, American and foreign, to which we could get access. Between this\r\narticle and the best of those works there will be found a general\r\nagreement, except as it respects beehives. We present views of hives,\r\nthat we are not aware have ever been written. The original idea, or new\r\nprinciple (which consists in constructing the hive with the entrance\r\nnear the top), was suggested to us by Samuel Pierce, Esq., of Troy, N.\r\nY., who is the great American inventor of cooking-ranges and stoves. We\r\nhave carefully considered the principle in its various relations to the\r\nhabits of the bee, and believe it correct. To most of our late works on\r\nhoney-bees we have one serious objection: it is, that they bear on their\r\nface the evidence of having been written to make money, by promoting the\r\nsale of some patent hive. These works all have a little in common that\r\nis interesting; the remainder seems designed to oppose some former\r\npatent and commend a new one. They thus swell their volumes to a\r\ntroublesome and expensive size, with that which is of no use to\r\npractical men. A work made to fight a patent, or to sell one, can not be\r\nreliable. The requisites to successful bee-management are the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n1. Always have large, strong swarms. Such only are able successfully to\r\ncontend with their enemies. This is done by uniting weak swarms, or\r\nsending back a young, feeble swarm when it comes out (as herein after\r\ndirected).\r\n\r\n2. Use medium-sized hives. In too large hives, bees find it difficult to\r\nguard their territories. They also store up more honey than they need,\r\nand yield less to the cultivator. The main box should be one foot square\r\nby fifteen inches high. Make hives of new boards; plane smooth and paint\r\nwhite on the outside. The usual direction is to leave the inside rough,\r\nto aid in holding up the honey, but to plane the inside edges so as to\r\nmake close joints. We counsel to plane the inside of the hive smooth,\r\nand draw a fine saw lightly length wise of the boards, to make the comb\r\nadhere. This will be a great saving of the time of bees, when it is\r\nworth the most in gathering honey. They always carry out all the sawdust\r\nfrom the inside of their hives. Better save their time by planing it\r\noff.\r\n\r\n3. To prevent robberies among bees, when a weak colony is attacked,\r\nclose their entrances so that but one bee can pass at once, and they\r\nwill then take care of themselves. To prevent a disposition to pillage,\r\nplace all your hives in actual contact, on the sides, and make a\r\ncommunication between them, but not large enough to allow bees to pass.\r\nThis will give the same scent to the whole, and make them feel like one\r\nfamily. Bees distinguish strangers only by the smell: hence, so\r\nconnected, they will not quarrel or pillage.\r\n\r\n4. Comb is usually regarded better for not being more than two or three\r\nyears old. The usual theory is, that cells fill up by repeated use, and,\r\nbecoming smaller, render the bees raised in them diminutive. This is not\r\nprobable, as a known habit of the bee is to clean out the cells before\r\nreusing them. Huber demonstrated that bees raised in drone-cells (which\r\nare always larger than for workers) grew no larger than in their own\r\nnatural cells. And as bees build their cells the right size at first, it\r\nis probable they keep them so. Quinby assures us that bees have been\r\ngrown twenty years in the same comb, and that the last were as large as\r\nthe first. But for other reasons, it is better to change the comb. In\r\nall ordinary cases, it is better to transfer the swarm to a new hive\r\nevery third year. Many think it best to use hives composed of three\r\nsections, seven and a half inches deep each, screwed together with\r\nstrips of wood on the sides, and the top screwed on that it may easily\r\nbe removed; thick paper or muslin should be pasted around, on the\r\nplaces of intersection, to guard against enemies; the two lower sections\r\nonly allowed to contain bees--the upper one being designed for the\r\nhoney-boxes, to be removed. Each spring, after two years old, the lower\r\nsection is taken out and a new one put on the top, the cover of the old\r\none having been first removed. This is the old \"pyramidal beehive,\"\r\nwhich is the title of a treatise on bees, by P. Ducouedic, translated\r\nfrom the French and abridged by Silas Dinsmore in 1829. This has\r\nrecently been revived and patented as a new thing. We think with Quinby,\r\nthat these hives are too expensive and too complicated, and that the\r\ngreat mass of cultivators will succeed best with hives of simple\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n5. Allowing bees to swarm in their own time and way is better than all\r\nartificial multiplication of colonies. If there are no small trees near\r\nthe apiary, place bushes, upon which the bees will usually light, when\r\nthey come out. If they seem determined to go away without lighting,\r\nthrow sand or dust among them; this produces confusion, and causes them\r\nto settle near. The practice of ringing bells and drumming on tin, &c.,\r\nis usually ridiculed; but we believe it to be useful, and that on\r\nphilosophic principles. The object to be secured is to confuse the swarm\r\nand drown the voice of the queen. The bees move only with their queen;\r\nhence, if anything prevents them from hearing her, confusion follows,\r\nand the swarm lights: therefore, any noise among them may answer the\r\npurpose, and save the swarm.\r\n\r\nTo hive bees, place them on a clean white cloth, and set the hive over\r\nthem, raised an inch or two by blocks under the corners. It is said that\r\na little sweetened water or honey, applied to the inside of the hive,\r\nwill incline the bees to remain. The best preparation is to fasten a\r\npiece of new white comb on the top of the inside of the hive. This is\r\ndone by dipping the end of a piece of comb in melted beeswax, and\r\nsticking it to the top. Bees should never be allowed to send off more\r\nthan two colonies in one season. To restrict them to one is still\r\nbetter. Excessive swarming is a precursor of destruction, rather than an\r\nevidence (as usually regarded) of prosperity. A given number of bees\r\nwill make far less honey in two hives than in one, unless they are so\r\nnumerous as greatly to crowd the hive. When a late swarm comes out, take\r\naway the queen, and they will immediately return. Any one may easily\r\nfind the queen: she is always in the centre of the bunch into which the\r\nswarm collects on lighting. If they form two or three clusters, it is\r\nbecause they have that number of queens. Then all the queens should be\r\ndestroyed. The following cuts of the three classes of bees will enable\r\none to distinguish the queen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Working Bee. Queen. Drone.]\r\n\r\nThe queen is sometimes, but not always, larger than the common bee; but\r\nher body is always longer, and blackish above and yellowish underneath.\r\n\r\nTo unite any two swarms together, turn the hive you wish to empty\r\nbottom-up, and place the one into which you would have them go on the\r\ntop of the other, with their mouths together; then tie a cloth around,\r\nat the place of intersection, to prevent the egress of the bees. Gently\r\nrap the lower hive on all sides, near the bottom, gradually rising until\r\nyou reach the top of the lower hive, and all the bees will go into the\r\nupper one.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, it is easy to remove a colony into a new hive, whenever\r\nyou think they need changing. This should be performed in the dusk of\r\nthe evening, and need occupy no more than half an hour. The hive should\r\nthen be put in its place. Uniting weak new swarms, may be done whenever\r\nthey come out; but changing a swarm from an old hive to a new one should\r\nbe performed as early as the middle of June. If moths get in, change\r\nhives at any time when it is warm enough for bees to work, and give them\r\nall the honey in their old hive. If you discover moths too late for the\r\nbees to build comb in a new hive, take the queen from the hive infested\r\nwith moths, and place it where the bees will unite with another colony,\r\nand feed them all the honey from the deserted hive. This, or the\r\ndestruction of the bees and saving the honey, is always necessary, when\r\nmoth-worms are in possession, unless they are so near the bottom, that\r\nall the comb around them may be cut out. Bees are fond of salt. Always\r\nkeep some on a board near them.\r\n\r\nThey also need water. If a rivulet runs near the apiary, it is well. If\r\nnot, place water in shallow pans, with pebbles in them, on which the\r\nbees can stand to drink. Change the water daily. It is too late to speak\r\nof the improvidence of killing bees, to get their honey. Use boxes of\r\nany size or construction you choose. In common hives, boxes should be\r\nattached to the sides, and not placed on the top. It is a wasteful tax\r\nupon the time and strength of loaded bees, to make them travel through\r\nthe whole length of the hive, into boxes on the top. Place boxes as near\r\nas possible to their entrance or below that entrance. Bees should be\r\nkept out of the boxes until they have pretty well filled the hive, or\r\nthey may begin to raise young bees in the boxes.\r\n\r\n_Wintering bees_ successfully, is one of the most difficult matters in\r\nbee-culture. Two evils are to be guarded against, dampness and\r\nsuffocation. Excessive dampness, sometimes causes frost about the\r\nentrance that fills it up and suffocation ensues. Sometimes snow falls,\r\nor is blown over the entrance, and the bees die in a few hours for the\r\nwant of air. Many large colonies, with plenty of honey, are thus\r\ndestroyed. Dampness is very injurious to bees on other accounts. In a\r\ngood bee-house there is no danger from snow, and little from dampness.\r\nBees, not having honey enough for winter, should be fed in pleasant fall\r\nweather, after they have nearly completed the labors of the season.\r\nWeighing hives is unnecessary. A moderate degree of judgment will\r\ndetermine whether a swarm has a sufficient store for winter. If not,\r\nfeed them. Never give bees dry sugar. They take up their food, as an\r\nelephant does water in his trunk; it, therefore, should be in a liquid\r\nform. Boil good sugar for ten minutes in ale or beer, leaving it about\r\nas thick as honey. Put it in a feed trough; which should be\r\nflat-bottomed.\r\n\r\nFasten together thin slats, one fourth of an inch apart, so as to fit\r\nthe inside of the feed trough and lie on the surface of the liquid, so\r\nas to rise and fall with it. Put this in a box and attach it to the\r\nhive, as for taking box-honey, and the bees will work it all up. Put\r\nout-door, it tempts other bees, and may lead to quarrels, and robbery.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known, that a good swarm of bees may be destroyed,\r\nby feeding them plenty of honey, early in the spring. They carry it in\r\nand fill up their empty cells and leave no room for raising young bees;\r\nhence the whole is ruined for want of inhabitants, to take the places of\r\nthose that get destroyed, or die of age.\r\n\r\nTo winter bees well, utterly exclude the light during all the cold\r\nweather, until it becomes so warm, that they will not get so chilled\r\nwhen out that they can not return. Intense cold is not injurious to\r\nbees, provided they are kept in the hive and are dry. A large swarm,\r\nwill not eat two pounds of honey during the whole cold winter, if kept\r\nfrom the light. When tempted out, every warm day they come into the\r\nsunshine and empty themselves, and return to consume large quantities of\r\nhoney. Kept in the dark, they are nearly torpid, eat but a mere trifle,\r\nand winter well. Whatever your hive or house, then, keep your bees\r\nentirely from the light, in cold weather. This is the only reason why\r\nbees keep so well in a dark dry cellar, or buried in the ground, with\r\nsomething around them, to preserve them from moisture, and a conductor\r\nthrough the surface, to admit fresh air. It is not because it keeps out\r\nthe cold, but because it excludes the light, and renders the bees\r\ninactive. Gilmore's patent bee-house, is a great improvement on this\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nOf the diseases of bees, such as dysentery, &c., we shall not treat. All\r\nthat can profitably be done, to remedy these evils, is secured by salt,\r\nwater, and properly-prepared food, as given above.\r\n\r\nBut the great question in bee-culture is, How to prevent the depredation\r\nof the wax-moth? To this subject, much study has been given, and\r\nrespecting it many theories have been advanced. The following\r\nsuggestions are, to us, the most satisfactory. The miller, that\r\ndeposites the egg, which soon changes to the worm, so destructive in the\r\nbeehive, commences to fly about, at dark. In almost every country-house,\r\nthey are seen about the lights in the evening. They are still during all\r\nthe day. They are remarkably attracted by lights in the evening. Hence\r\nour first rule:--\r\n\r\n1. Place a teasaucer of melted lard or oil, with a piece of cotton\r\nflannel for a wick, in or near the apiary at dusk; light it and allow it\r\nto burn till near morning, expiring before daylight. This done every\r\nnight during the month of June, will be very effectual.\r\n\r\n2. Keep grass and weeds away from the immediate vicinity of your apiary.\r\nLet the ground be kept clean and smooth. This destroys many of the\r\nhiding-places of the miller, and forces him away to spend the day. This\r\nprecaution has many other advantages.\r\n\r\n3. Keep large strong colonies. They will be able to guard their\r\nterritories, and contend with this and all other enemies.\r\n\r\n4. Never have any opening in a beehive near the bottom, during the\r\nseason of millers (see Beehive). Let the openings be so small, that only\r\none or two bees can pass at once. To accommodate the bees, increase the\r\nnumber of openings. Millers will seldom enter among a strong swarm, with\r\nsuch openings. All around the bottom, it should be so tight, that no\r\ncrevice can be found, in which a miller can deposite an egg. Better\r\nplaster around, closely, with some substance, the place of contact\r\nbetween the hive and the board on which it stands, and keep it entirely\r\ntight during the time in which the millers are active.\r\n\r\n5. If, through negligence, worms have got into a hive, examine it at\r\nonce; and if they are near the bottom only, within sight and reach, cut\r\nout the comb around them, and remove them from the hive. If this is not\r\npracticable, transfer the swarm to a new hive, or unite it with another,\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\n6. The great remedy for the moth is in the right construction of a\r\nBEEHIVE.\r\n\r\nWhatever the form of the hive you use, have the entrance within three or\r\nfour inches of the top. Millers are afraid of bees; they will not go\r\namong them, unless they are in a weak, dispirited condition. They steal\r\ninto the hive when the bees are quiet, up among the comb, or when they\r\nhang out in warm weather, but are still and quiet. If the hive be open\r\non all sides (as is so often recommended), the miller enters on some\r\nside where the bees are not. Now bees are apt to go to the upper part of\r\nthe hive and comb, and leave the lower part and entrance exposed. If the\r\nentrance be at the upper part, the bees will fill it and be all about\r\nit. A bee can easily pass through a cluster of bees, and enter or leave\r\na hive; but a miller will never undertake it: this, then, will be a\r\nperfect safeguard against the depredations of the moth. This hive is\r\nbetter on every account. Moisture rises: in a hive open only at the\r\nbottom, it is likely to rise to the top of the hive and injure the bees;\r\nwith the opening near the top it easily escapes. The objection that\r\nwould be soonest raised to this suggestion is, that bees need a good\r\ncirculation of fresh air, and such a hive would not favor it. To this we\r\nreply, a hive open near the top secures the best possible air to the\r\nswarm; any foul air has opportunity freely to escape. That peculiar\r\nhumming heard in a hive in hot weather is produced by a certain motion\r\nof the wings of the bees, designed to expel vitiated air, and admit the\r\npure, by keeping up a current. In the daytime, when the weather is hot,\r\nyou will see a few bees near the entrance on the outside, and hear\r\nothers within, performing this service, and, when fatigued, others take\r\ntheir place. This is one of the most wonderful things in all the habits\r\nand instincts of bees. They thus keep a pure atmosphere in a crowded\r\nhive in hot weather. Now, it would require much less fanning to expel\r\nbad air from a hive open at the top, than from one where all that air\r\nhad to be forced down, through an opening at the bottom. This theory is\r\nsustained by the natural habits of bees in their wild state. Wild bees,\r\nthat select their own abodes, are found in trees and crevices of rocks.\r\nThey usually build their combs _downward_ from their entrance, and their\r\nabode is air-tight at the bottom; they have no air only what is admitted\r\nat their entrance, near the top of their dwelling, and with no current\r\nof air only what they choose to produce by fanning. The purest\r\natmosphere in any room is where it enters and passes out at the top; in\r\nsuch a room only does the external atmosphere circulate naturally. It is\r\non the same principle that bees keep better buried than in any other\r\nway, provided only they are kept dry. Yet they are in a place air-tight,\r\nexcept the small conductor to the atmosphere above them. The old\r\n\"pyramidal beehive\" of Ducouedic, with three sections, one above the\r\nother, allowing the removal of the lower one each spring, and the\r\nplacing of a new one on the top--thus changing the comb, so that none\r\nshall ever be more than two years old, with the opening always within\r\nthree or four inches of the top, is the best of the patent hives. We\r\nprefer plain, simple hives. The general adoption of this principle,\r\nwhatever hives are used, would be a new era in the science of\r\nbee-culture. No beehive should ever be exposed to the direct rays of the\r\nsun in a beehouse. A hive standing alone, with a free circulation of air\r\non every side, will not be seriously injured by the sun. But when the\r\nrays are intercepted by walls or boards, in the rear and on the sides,\r\nthey are very disastrous. Other hints, such as clearing off\r\noccasionally, in all seasons except in the cold of winter, the bottom\r\nboard, &c., are matters upon which we need not dwell. No cultivator\r\nwould think of neglecting them. Let no one be alarmed at finding dead\r\nbees on the bottom when clearing out a hive; bees live only from five to\r\nseven months, and their places are then supplied with young ones. The\r\nabove suggestions followed, and a little care taken in cultivating the\r\nfruits, grains, and grasses, that yield the best flowers for bees,\r\n_would secure uniform success_ in raising honey. This is one of the\r\nfinest luxuries; and, what is a great desideratum, it is within the easy\r\nreach of every poor family, even, in all the rural districts of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nGood honey, good vegetables, and good fruit, like rain and sunshine,\r\nmay be the property of all. The design of this volume is to enable the\r\npoor and the unlearned to enjoy these things in abundance, with only\r\nthat amount of care and labor necessary to give them a zest.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEETS.\r\n\r\nOf this excellent root there are quite a number of varieties.\r\nMangel-Wurtzel yields most for field-culture, and is the great beet for\r\nfeeding to domestic animals; not generally used for the table. French\r\nSugar or Amber Beet is good for field-culture, both in quality and\r\nyield; but it is not equal to the Wurtzel. Yellow-Turnip-rooted, Early\r\nBlood-Turnip-rooted, Early Dwarf Blood, Early White Scarcity, and Long\r\nBlood, are among the leading garden varieties. Of all the beets, three\r\nonly need be cultivated in this country--the Wurtzel for feeding, and\r\nthe Early Blood Turnip-rooted and Long Blood for the table. The Early\r\nBlood is the best through the whole season, comes early, and can be\r\neasily kept so as to be good for the table in the spring. The Long Blood\r\nis later, and very much esteemed. Beets may be easily forwarded in\r\nhotbeds. Sow seed early, and transplant in garden as soon as the soil is\r\nwarm enough to promote their growth. When well done, the removal retards\r\ntheir growth but little.\r\n\r\nYoung beets are universally esteemed. To have them of excellent quality\r\nduring all the winter, it is only necessary to plant on the last days of\r\nJuly. If the weather be dry, water well, so as to get them up, and they\r\nwill attain the size and age at which they are most valued. Keep them in\r\nthe cellar for use, as other beets. They will keep as well as old ones.\r\n\r\n_Field-Culture._--Make the soil very mellow, fifteen to eighteen inches\r\ndeep. Soil having a little sand in its composition is always best. Even\r\nvery sandy land is good if it be sufficiently enriched. Choose land on\r\nwhich water will not stand in a wet season. Beets endure drought better\r\nthan extreme wet. Having made the surface perfectly mellow, and free\r\nfrom clods, weeds, and stones, sow in drills, with a machine for the\r\npurpose, two feet apart. This is wide enough for a small cultivator to\r\npass between them. After planting, roll the surface smooth and level;\r\nthis will greatly facilitate early cultivation. On a rough surface you\r\ncan not cultivate small plants without destroying many of them; hence\r\nthe necessity of straight rows and thorough rolling. The English books\r\nrecommend planting this and other roots on ridges: for their climate it\r\nis good, but for ours it is bad. They have to guard against too much\r\nmoisture, and we against drought; hence, they should plant on ridges,\r\nand we on an even surface. To get the largest crop, plow a deep furrow\r\nfor each row, put in plenty of good manure, cover it with the plow and\r\nlevel the surface, and plant over the manure. When well growing, they\r\nshould be thinned to six or eight inches in the row. Often stirring the\r\nearth while they are young is of great benefit. The quality and quantity\r\nof a root-crop depend much upon the rapidity of its growth. Slow growth\r\ngives harder roots of worse flavor, as well as a stinted crop.\r\n\r\n_Harvesting_ should be done just before severe frosts. They will grow\r\nuntil frost comes, however early they were planted, or whatever size\r\nthey may have attained. They grow as rapidly after light frosts as at\r\nany time in the season; but very severe frosts expose them to rot during\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n_Preserving_ for table use is usually done by putting in boxes with\r\nmoist sand, or the mould in which they grew. This excludes air, and, if\r\nkept a little moist, will preserve them perfectly. Roots are always\r\nbetter buried below frost out-door on a dry knoll, where water will not\r\nstand in the pits. But in cold climates it is necessary to have some in\r\nthe cellar for winter use. The common method of burying beets, and\r\nturnips, and all other roots out-door, is well understood. The only\r\nrequisites are, a dry location secured from frost, straw next the roots,\r\na covering of earth, not too deep while the weather is yet mild; as it\r\ngrows cold, put on another covering of straw, and over it a foot of\r\nearth; as it becomes very cold, put on a load or two of barnyard manure:\r\nthis will save them beyond the power of the coldest winter. Vast\r\nquantities of roots buried outdoor are destroyed annually by frost, and\r\nthere is no need of ever losing a bushel. You \"_thought_ they would not\r\nfreeze,\" is not half as good as spending two hours' time in covering, so\r\nthat you _know_ they can not freeze. There is hardly a more provoking\r\npiece of carelessness, in the whole range of domestic economy, than the\r\nneedless loss of so many edible roots by frost.\r\n\r\n_The table use_ of beets is everywhere known; their value for feeding\r\nanimals is not duly appreciated in this country. No one who keeps\r\ndomestic animals or fowls should fail to raise a beet-crop; it is one of\r\nthe surest crops grown; it is never destroyed by insects, and drought\r\naffects it but very little. On good soil, beets produce an enormous\r\nweight to the acre. The lower leaves may be stripped off twice during\r\nthe season, to feed to cows or other stock, without injury to the crop.\r\nCows will give more milk for fifteen days, fed on this root alone, than\r\non any other feed; they then begin to get too fat, and decline in milk:\r\nhence, they should be fed beets and hay or other food in about equal\r\nparts, on which they will do better than in any other way. Horses do\r\nbetter on equal parts of beet and hay than on ordinary hay and grain.\r\nHorses fed thus will fatten, needing only the addition of a little\r\nground grain, when working hard. Plenty of beets, with a little other\r\nfood, makes cows give milk as well as in summer. Raw beets cut fine,\r\nwith a little milk, will fatten hogs as fast as boiled potatoes. All\r\nfowls are fond of them, chopped fine and mixed with other food. Sheep,\r\nalso, are fond of them. They are very valuable to ewes in the spring\r\nwhen lambs come, when they especially need succulent food. The free use\r\nof this root by English farmers is an important reason of their great\r\nsuccess in raising fine sheep and lambs. They promote the health of\r\nanimals, and none ever tire of them. As it needs no cooking, it is the\r\ncheapest food of the root kind. Beets will keep longer, and in better\r\ncondition, than any other root. They never give any disagreeable flavor\r\nto milk. It is considered established, now, that four pounds of beet\r\nequal in nourishment five pounds of carrot. Every large feeder should\r\nhave a cellar beyond the reach of frosts, and of large dimensions,\r\naccessible at all times, in which to keep his roots. These beets should\r\nbe piled up there as cord-wood, to give a free circulation of the air.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, the beet-crop takes the place of much of their meadows, at\r\na great saving of expense, producing remarkably fine horses, and\r\nfattening immense herds of cattle, which they export to France. We\r\ninsist upon the importance of a beet-crop to every man who owns an acre\r\nof land and a few domestic animals, or only a cow and a few fowls.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENE PLANT.\r\n\r\nIntroduced into the Southern states by negroes from Africa. They boil a\r\nhandful of the seed with their allowance of Indian corn. It yields a\r\nlarger proportion than any other plant of an excellent oil. It is\r\nextensively cultivated in Egypt as food for horses, and for culinary\r\npurposes. It is remarkable that this native of a southern clime should\r\nflourish well, as it does, in the Northern states. It should be\r\ncultivated throughout the North as a medicinal herb.\r\n\r\nA Virginia gentleman gave Thorburn & Son, seed-dealers of New York, the\r\nfollowing account of its virtues: a few green leaves of the plant,\r\nplunged a few times in a tumbler of cold water, made it like a thin\r\njelly, without taste or color. Children afflicted with summer-complaint\r\ndrink it freely, and it is thought to be the best remedy for that\r\ndisease ever discovered; it is believed that three thousand children\r\nwere saved by it in Baltimore the first summer after its introduction.\r\nPlant in April, in the middle states, about two feet apart. When half\r\ngrown, break off the plants, to increase the quantity of leaves. We\r\nrecommend to all families to raise it, and try its virtues, under the\r\nadvice of their family physicians.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS.\r\n\r\nThese are exceedingly useful in destroying insects. So of toads and\r\nbats. No one should ever be wantonly killed. Boys, old or young, should\r\nnever be allowed to shoot birds, or disturb their nests, only as they\r\nwould domestic fowls, for actual use. A wanton recklessness is exhibited\r\nabout our cities and villages, in killing off small birds, that are of\r\nno use after they are dead. Living, they are valuable to every garden\r\nand fruit-orchard. In every state, stringent laws should be made and\r\nenforced against their destruction. Even the crow, without friends as he\r\nis, is a real blessing to the farmer: keep him from the young corn for a\r\nfew days, as it is easy to do, and, all the rest of the year, his\r\ndestruction of worms and insects is a great blessing. Birds, therefore,\r\nshould be baited, fed, and tamed, as much as possible, to encourage them\r\nto feel at home on our premises. Having protected our small fruits, they\r\nclaim a share, and they have not always a just view of the rights of\r\nproperty, nor do they always exhibit good judgment in dividing it. It is\r\nbest to buy them off by feeding them with something else. If they still\r\nprefer the fruit, hang little bells in the trees, where they will make a\r\nnoise; or hang pieces of tin, old looking-glass, or even shingles, by\r\nstrings, so that they will keep in motion, and the birds will keep away.\r\nImages standing still are useless, as the birds often build nests in the\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACKBERRY.\r\n\r\nThis berry grows wild, in great abundance, in many parts of the country.\r\nIt has been so plentiful, especially in the newer parts, that its\r\ncultivation has not been much attended to until recently. Like all other\r\nberries, the cultivated bear the largest and best fruit.\r\n\r\n_Uses._--It is one of the finest desert berries; excellent in milk, and\r\nfor tarts, pies, &c. Blackberries make the best vinegar for table use,\r\nand a wine that retains the peculiar flavor, and of a beautiful color.\r\n\r\nThis berry comes in after the raspberries, and ripens long in succession\r\non the same bush.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: High-bush Blackberry.]\r\n\r\n_Varieties_ of wild ones, usually found growing in the borders of fields\r\nand woods, are the low-bush and the high-bush. Downing gives the first\r\nplace to the low. Our experience is, that the high is the best bearer of\r\nthe best fruit. We have often gathered them one and one fourth inches in\r\nlength, very black, and of delicious sweetness. The low ones that have\r\ncome under our observation have been smaller and nearer round, and not\r\nnearly so sweet.\r\n\r\nThe best cultivated varieties are--\r\n\r\nTHE DORCHESTER--Introduced from Massachusetts, and a vigorous, large,\r\nregular bearer.\r\n\r\nLAWTON, OR NEW ROCHELLE.--This is the great blackberry of this country,\r\nby the side of which, no other, yet known, need be cultivated. It is a\r\nvery hardy, great grower. It is an enormous bearer of such fruit that it\r\ncommands thirty cents per quart, when other blackberries sell for ten.\r\nOn a rather moist, heavy loam, and especially in the shade, its\r\nproductions are truly wonderful. Continues to ripen daily for six weeks.\r\n\r\n_Propagation_ is by offshoots from the old roots, or by seeds. When by\r\nseeds, they should be planted in mellow soil, and where the sun will not\r\nshine on them between eight and five o'clock in hot weather. In\r\ntransplanting, much care is requisite. The bark of the roots is like\r\nevergreens, very tender and easily broken, or injured by exposure to the\r\natmosphere; hence, take up carefully, and keep covered from sun and air\r\nuntil transplanted. This is destined to become one of the\r\nuniversally-cultivated small fruits--as much so as the strawberry. The\r\nbest manures are, wood-ashes, leaves, decayed wood, and all kinds of\r\ncoarse litter, with stable manure well incorporated with the soil,\r\nbefore transplanting. Animal manure should not be very plentifully\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in Illinois a vigorous bush, and apparently good bearer, of\r\nperfect fruit--a variety called _white blackberry_. The fruit was\r\ngreenish and pleasant to the taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK RASPBERRY.\r\n\r\nThe common wild, found by fences, especially in the margin of forests,\r\nin most parts of the United Sates, is very valuable for cultivation in\r\ngardens. Coming in after the red raspberry, and ripening in succession\r\nuntil the blackberry commences, it is highly esteemed. Cultivated with\r\nlittle animal manure, but plenty of sawdust, tan-bark, old leaves, wood,\r\nchips, and coarse litter, it improves very much from its wild state.\r\nFruit is all borne on bushes of the previous year's growth; hence, after\r\nthey have done bearing, cut away the old bushes. To secure the greatest\r\nyield on rich land, cut off the tops of the shoots rising for next\r\nyear's fruit, when they are four or five feet high. The result will be,\r\nstrong shoots from behind all the leaves on the upper part of the stalk,\r\neach of which will bear nearly as much fruit as would the whole have\r\ndone without clipping. A dozen of these would occupy but a small place\r\nin a border, or by a wall. Not an American garden should be found\r\nwithout them.\r\n\r\n\r\nBONES.\r\n\r\nBones are one of the most valuable manures. They yield the phosphates in\r\nlarge measure. On all land needing lime, they are very valuable. The\r\nheads, &c., about butchers' shops will bear a transportation of twenty\r\nmiles to put upon meadows. Break them with the head of an axe, and pound\r\nthem into the sod, even with the surface. They add greatly to the\r\nproducts of a meadow. Ground, they make one of the best manures of\r\ncommerce. A cheap method for the farmer is to deposite a load of\r\nhorse-manure, and on that a load of bones, and alternate each, till he\r\nhas used up all his bones. Cover the last load of bones deep with\r\nmanure. It will make a splendid hotbed, and the fermentation of the\r\nmanure will dissolve or pulverize the bones, and the heap will become\r\none mass of the most valuable manure, especially for roots and vines,\r\nand all vegetables requiring a rich, fine manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBORECOLE, OR KALE.\r\n\r\nThere are some fifteen or twenty kinds cultivated in Europe. Two only,\r\nthe green and the brown, are desirable in this country. Cultivate as\r\ncabbage. In portions of the middle states they will stand the frosts of\r\nwinter well, without much protection; further north, they need\r\nprotection with a little brush and straw during severe frosts. Those\r\ngrown on rather hard land are better for winter; being less succulent,\r\nthey endure cold better. Cut them off for use whenever you choose. They\r\ndo not head like cabbage; they have full bunches of curled leaves. Cut\r\noff so as to include all, not over eight inches long. In winter, after\r\nhaving been pretty well exposed to the frost, they are very fine. Set\r\nout the stumps early in spring, and they will yield a profusion of\r\ndelicious sprouts. This would be a valuable addition to many of our\r\nkitchen gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROCCOLI.\r\n\r\nThis may be regarded as a late flowering species of cauliflower. It\r\nshould be planted and treated as cabbage, and fine heads will be\r\nformed, in the middle states, in October: at the South much earlier,\r\naccording to latitude. Take up in November, and preserve as cabbage, and\r\ngood ones may be had in winter. To prevent ravages of insects, mix ashes\r\nin the soil when transplanting, or fresh loam or earth from a new field;\r\nor trench deep, so as to throw up several inches of subsoil, which had\r\nnot before been disturbed.\r\n\r\nTo save seed, transplant some of the best in spring; break off all the\r\nlower sprouts, allowing only a few of the best centre ones to grow. Tie\r\nthem to stakes, to prevent destruction by storms. Be sure to have\r\nnothing else of the cabbage kind near your seed broccoli.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROOM CORN.\r\n\r\nCultivated like other corn, only that this is more generally planted in\r\ndrills. Three feet apart, and six inches in the drill, it yields more\r\nweight of better corn to the acre than to have it nearer. The great\r\nfault in raising this crop is getting it too thick. The finest-looking\r\nbrush is of corn cut while yet so green that the seed is useless. But\r\nthe brush is stronger, and will make better brooms for wear, when the\r\ncorn is allowed to stand until the seed is hard, though not till the\r\nbrush is dry. The land should be rich. This is a hard, exhausting crop\r\nfor the soil. To harvest, bend down, two feet from the ground, two rows,\r\nallowing them so to fall across each other as to expose all the heads.\r\nCut off the heads, with six or eight inches of the stalk, and place them\r\non top of the bent rows to dry. In a week, in dry weather, they will be\r\nwell cured, and should be then spread thin, under cover, in plenty of\r\nair. There is no worse article to heat and mould. In large crops, they\r\nusually take off the seed before curing; it is much lighter to handle,\r\nand less bulky. It may be done then, or in winter, as you prefer. The\r\nseed is removed on a cylinder eighteen inches long, and two and a half\r\nfeet in diameter, having two hundred wrought nails with their points\r\nprojecting. It is turned by a crank, like a fanning mill. The corn is\r\nheld in a convenient handful, like flax on a hatchel. Where large\r\nquantities are to be cleaned of the seed, power is used to turn the\r\nmachine. Ground or boiled, the seed makes good feed for most animals.\r\nDry, it has too hard a shell. Fowls, with access to plenty of gravel, do\r\nwell on it. Broom-corn is not a very profitable crop, except to those\r\nwho manufacture their own corn into brooms. There is much labor about\r\nit, and considerable hazard of injuring the crop, by the inexperienced;\r\nhence, young farmers had, generally, better let it alone. There are two\r\nvarieties--they may be forms of growth, from peculiar habits of\r\nculture--one, short, with a large, stiff brush running up through the\r\nmiddle, with short branches to the top, called pine-top: it is of no\r\nvalue;--the other is a long, fine brush, the middle being no coarser\r\nthan the outside. It should be planted with a seed-drill, to make the\r\nrows straight and narrow for the convenience of cultivation. Harrowing\r\nwith a span of horses, with a =V= drag, one front tooth out,\r\nas soon as the corn is up, is beneficial to the crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUSSELS SPROUTS.\r\n\r\nThis is a species of cabbage. A long stem runs up, on which grow\r\nnumerous cabbage-heads in miniature. The centre head is small and of\r\nlittle use, and the large leaves drop off early. It will grow among\r\nalmost anything else, without injury to either. It is raised from seed\r\nlike cabbage, and cultivated in all respects the same. Eighteen inches\r\napart each way is a proper distance, as the plant spreads but little.\r\nGood, either as a cabbage, or when very small, as greens. They are good\r\neven after very hard frosts. By forwarding in hotbed in the spring, and\r\nby planting late ones for winter, they may be had most of the year. If\r\nthey are disposed to run to seed too early, it may be prevented by\r\npulling up, and setting out again in the shade. Save seed as from\r\ncabbage, but use great caution that they are not near enough to receive\r\nthe farina from any of the rest of the cabbage-tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCKTHORN.\r\n\r\nThis is the most valuable of the thorn tribe, for hedge, in this\r\ncountry. It never suffers from those enemies that destroy so much of the\r\nhawthorn. This is also used for dyeing and for medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCKWHEAT.\r\n\r\nThis will grow well on almost any soil; even that too poor for most\r\nother crops will yield very good buckwheat--though rich land is better\r\nfor this, as for all other crops. The heat of summer is apt to blast it\r\nwhen filling; hence, in the middle states, it is not best to sow it\r\nuntil into July. It fills well in cool, moist weather, and is quite a\r\nsure crop if sowed at the right time. On poor land, one bushel of seed\r\nis required for an acre, while half a bushel is sufficient on rich land,\r\nwhere stalks grow large.\r\n\r\nThe blossoms yield to the honey-bee very large quantities of honey, much\r\ninferior to that made of white clover; it may be readily distinguished\r\nin the comb by its dark color and peculiar flavor. Ground, it is good\r\nfor most animals, and for fowls unground, mixed with other grain. It\r\nremains long in land; but it is a weed easily killed with the hoe; or a\r\nfarmer may set apart a small field for an annual crop, keeping up the\r\nland by the application of three pecks of plaster per acre each year. It\r\nis very popular as human food, and always made into pancakes. The free\r\nuse of it is said to promote eruptive diseases. The India buckwheat is\r\nmore productive, but of poorer quality. The bran is the best article\r\nknown to mix with horse-manure and spade into radish beds, to promote\r\ngrowth and kill worms.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUDDING.\r\n\r\nThis is usually given under the article on peaches. But, as it is a\r\ngeneral subject, it should be in a separate article, reserving what is\r\npeculiar to the different fruits to be noticed under their respective\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Budding.]\r\n\r\nBudding small trees should usually be performed very near the ground,\r\nand on a smooth place. Any sharp pocket-knife will do; but a regular\r\nbudding knife, now for sale in most hardware-stores, is preferable. Cut\r\nthrough the bark in the form of a horizontal crescent (_a_ in the cut).\r\nSplit the bark down from the cut three fourths of an inch, and, with the\r\nivory-end of the knife, raise the corners and edges of the bark. Select\r\na vigorous shoot of this year's growth, but having buds well\r\nmatured--select a bud that bids fairest to be a leaf-bud, as\r\nblossom-buds will fail--insert the knife half an inch below the bud, and\r\ncut upward in a straight line, severing the bark and a thin piece of the\r\nwood to one half inch above the bud, and let the knife run out: you\r\nthen have a bud ready for insertion (_c_ in cut). The English method is\r\nto remove the wood from the bud before inserting it; this is attended\r\nwith danger to the vitality of the bud, and is, therefore, less certain\r\nof success, and it is no better when it does succeed. Hence, American\r\nauthorities favor inserting the bud with the wood remaining. Insert the\r\nlower end of this slip between the two edges of the bark, passing the\r\nbud down between those edges, until the top of the slip comes below the\r\nhorizontal cut, and remaining contiguous to it. If the bud slip be too\r\nlong, after it is sufficiently pressed down, cut off the top so as to\r\nmake a good fit with the bark above the cut (_b_ in cut). The lower end\r\nof the bud will have raised the split bark a little more to make room\r\nfor itself, and thus will set very close to the stalk. Tie the bud in\r\nwith a soft ligature; commence at the bottom of the split, and wind\r\nclosely until the whole wound is covered, leaving only the bud exposed\r\n(_d_ in cut). It is more convenient to commence at the top, but it is\r\nless certain to confine the slip opposite the bud in close contact with\r\nthe stalk: this is indispensable to success. We have often seen buds\r\nadhere well at the bottom, but stand out from the stalk, and thus be\r\nruined.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Buds._--Take thrifty, vigorous shoots of this year's\r\ngrowth, with well-matured buds; cut off the leaves one half inch from\r\nthe stalks (_e_ in cut); wrap them in moist moss or grass, or put them\r\nin sawdust, or bury them one foot in the ground.\r\n\r\n_Bands._--The best yet known is the inside bark of the linden or\r\nAmerican basswood. In June, when the bark slips easily, strip it from\r\nthe tree, remove the coarse outside, immerse the inside bark in water\r\nfor twenty days; the fibres will then easily separate, and become soft\r\nand pliable as satin ribbon. Cut it into convenient lengths, say one\r\nfoot, and lay them away in a dry state, in which they will keep for\r\nyears. This will afford good ties for many uses, such as bandages of\r\nvegetables for market, &c. Matting that comes around Russia iron and\r\nfurniture does very well for bands; woollen yarn and candle-wicking are\r\nalso used; but the bass-bark is best. After ten days the bands should be\r\nloosened and retied; then, if the bud is dried, it is spoiled, and the\r\ntree should be rebudded in another place; at the end of three weeks, if\r\nthe bud adheres firmly, remove the band entirely. Better not bud on the\r\nsouth side; it is liable to injury in winter. In the spring, after the\r\nswelling of buds, but before the appearance of leaves, cut off the top\r\nfour inches above the bud; when the bud grows, tie the tender shoot to\r\nthe stalk (growing bud in cut, _f_). In July, cut the wood off even with\r\nthe base of the bud and slanting up smoothly.\r\n\r\n_Causes of Failure._--If you insert a blossom-bud you will get no shoot,\r\nalthough the bud may adhere well. If scions cut for buds remain two\r\nhours in the sun with the leaves on, in a hot day, they will all be\r\nspoiled. The leaves draw the moisture from the bud, and soon ruin it.\r\nCut the leaves off at once. If you use buds from a scion not fully\r\ngrown, very few of them will live; they must be matured. If the top of\r\nthe branch selected be growing and very tender, use no buds near the top\r\nof it. If in raising the bark to make room for the bud, you injure the\r\nsoft substance between the bark and the wood, the bud will not adhere.\r\nIf the bud be not brought in close contact with the stalk and firmly\r\nconfined there, it will not grow. With reasonable caution on these\r\npoints, not more than one in fifty need fail.\r\n\r\n_Time for Budding._--This varies with the season. In the latitude of\r\ncentral New York, in a dry season, when everything matures early, bud\r\npeaches from the 15th to the 25th of August--plums, &c., earlier. In wet\r\nand great growing seasons, the first ten days in September are best.\r\nMuch budding is lost on account of having been done so late as to allow\r\nno time for the buds to adhere before the tree stops growing for the\r\nseason. If budding is performed too early, the stalk grows too much over\r\nthe bud, and it gums and dies. It is utterly useless to bud when the\r\nbark is with difficulty loosened; it is always a failure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUSHES.\r\n\r\nThe growth of bushes over pastures, along fences, and in the streets,\r\nshows a great want of thrift, and an unpardonable carelessness in a\r\nfarmer. In pastures, so far from being harmless, they take so much from\r\nthe soil as to materially injure the quality and quantity of the grass.\r\nThe only truly effectual method of destroying noxious shrubs, is by\r\ngrubbing them up with a mattock. Frequent cutting of bushes inclining to\r\nspread only increases the difficulty, by giving strength and extension\r\nto the roots. Cutting bushes thoroughly in August, in a wet season, and\r\napplying manure and plaster to promote the growth of grass, will\r\nsometimes quite effectually destroy them. Larger trees, as the sweet\r\nlocust, that are troublesome on account of sprouting out from the\r\nroots, when cut down, are effectually killed by girdling two feet from\r\nthe ground, and allowing to stand one year. The tree, roots, and all,\r\nare sure to die.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTER.\r\n\r\nRaising the cream, churning, working, and preserving, are the points in\r\nsuccessful butter-making. To raise cream, milk may be set in tin, wood,\r\nor cast-iron dishes. The best are iron, tinned over on the inside. Tin\r\nis better than wood, only on account of its being more easily kept\r\nclean. No one can ever make good butter without keeping everything about\r\nthe dairy perfectly clean and sweet. Milk should never stand more than\r\nthree inches deep in the pans, to raise the best and most cream. It\r\nshould be set in an airy room, containing nothing else. Butter and milk\r\nwill collect and retain the flavor of any other substance near them,\r\nmore readily than anything else; hence, milk set in a cellar containing\r\nonions, or in a room with new cheese, makes butter highly flavored with\r\nthose articles.\r\n\r\n_Temperature_ is an important matter. It should be regular, at from\r\nfifty to fifty-five degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer. It is sometimes\r\ndifficult to be exact in this matter, but come as near it as possible.\r\nThis can be well regulated in a good cool cellar, into which air can be\r\nplentifully admitted at pleasure. Those who are so situated that their\r\nmilk-house can stand over a spring, with pure water running over its\r\nstone floor, are favored. Those who will take pains to lay ice in their\r\nmilk-rooms, in very warm weather, will find it pay largely in the\r\nquality and quantity of their butter. Those who will not follow either\r\nof the above directions, must be content to make less butter, and of\r\nrather inferior quality, out of the same quantity of milk.\r\n\r\n_Skimming_ should be attended to when the milk has soured just enough to\r\nhave a little of it curdle on the bottom of the pan. If it should nearly\r\nall curdle, it would not be a serious injury, unless it should become\r\nold. If you have not conveniences for keeping milk sufficiently warm in\r\ncold weather, place it over the stove at once, when drawn, and give it a\r\nscalding heat, and the cream will rise in a much shorter space of time,\r\nand more plentifully. Milk should be strained and set as soon as\r\npossible after being drawn from the cow, and with the least possible\r\nagitation. The unpleasant flavor imparted to milk from the food of the\r\ncows, such as turnips or leeks, may be at once removed by adding to the\r\nmilk, before straining, one eighth of its quantity of boiling water; or\r\ntwo ounces of nitre boiled in one quart of water and bottled, and a\r\nsmall teacupful put in twelve quarts of milk, will answer the same\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n_Milking_ should be performed with great care. Experiments have\r\ndemonstrated that the last drawn from a cow yields from six to sixteen\r\ntimes as large a quantity of better cream than that first drawn.\r\nCareless milking will make the quantity of butter less, and the quality\r\ninferior, while it dries up the cows. There are probably millions of\r\ncows now in the United States that are indifferent milkers from this\r\nvery cause. Quick and clean milking, from the time they first came in,\r\nwould have made them worth twice as much, for butter and milk, as they\r\nare now. Always milk as quickly as possible, and without stopping, after\r\nyou commence, and as nearly as possible at the same hour of the day.\r\nLeaving a teacupful, or even half that quantity, in milking each cow,\r\nwill very materially lessen the products of the dairy, and seriously\r\ninjure the cows for future use. Great milkers will yield considerable\r\nmore by having it drawn three times per day. The quantity of milk given\r\nby a cow will never injure her, provided she be well fed. As it takes\r\nfood to make meat, so it does also to make milk; you can never get\r\nsomething for nothing. The best breeds of swine, cattle, or fowls, can\r\nnot be fattened without being well fed: so the best cows will never give\r\nlarge messes of milk unless they are largely fed.\r\n\r\n_Churning._--This is entirely a mechanical process. The agitation of the\r\ncream dashes the oily globules in the cream against each other, and they\r\nremain together and grow larger, until the butter is, what the dairy\r\nwoman calls, gathered. The butter in the milk, when drawn from the cow,\r\nis the same as when on the table, only it is in the milk in the form of\r\nvery small globes: churning brings them together. The object then to be\r\nsecured, by any form of a churn, is agitation, or dashing and beating\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n_Temperature of the Cream_ should be from sixty to sixty-five\r\ndegrees--perhaps sixty-two is best. This had better always be determined\r\nby a thermometer immersed in it.\r\n\r\nMany churns have been invented and patented; and every new one is, of\r\ncourse, the best. A cylinder is usually preferred as the best form for a\r\nchurn, and the churning is performed by turning a crank. An oblong\r\nsquare box is far better than a cylinder. In churning in a cylinder, it\r\nmay often occur that the cream moves round in a body with the dasher,\r\nand so is but slightly agitated. But change that cylinder into an oblong\r\nsquare, and the cream is so dashed against the corners of the box that a\r\nmost rapid agitation is the result, and the churning is finished in a\r\nshort space of time.\r\n\r\nAny person of a little mechanical genius can construct a churn, equal to\r\nany in use, and at a trifling expense. It is well to make a churn\r\ndouble, leaving an inch between the two, into which cold or warm water\r\ncan be poured, to regulate the temperature of the cream. This would be a\r\ngreat saving of time and patience in churning. Those who use the\r\nold-fashioned churns with dashes can most conveniently warm or cool\r\ntheir cream, by placing the churn containing it in a tub of cold or\r\nboiling water, as the case may require, until it comes to the\r\ntemperature of sixty or seventy degrees.\r\n\r\nTo make butter of extra quality for the fair, or for a luxury on your\r\nown table, set only one third of the milk, and that the last drawn from\r\nthe cow. The Scotch, so celebrated for making butter of more marrowy\r\nrichness than any other, first let the calves draw half or two thirds of\r\nthe milk, and then take the remainder. This makes the finest butter in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n_Preserving Butter_ depends upon the treatment immediately after\r\nchurning. Success depends upon getting the buttermilk all out, and\r\nputting in all the salt you put in at all, immediately--say within ten\r\nminutes after churning. Some accomplish this by washing, and others by\r\nworking it, being much opposed to putting in a drop of water. Those who\r\nuse water in their butter, and those who do not, are equally confident\r\nof the superiority of their own method. But all good butter-makers\r\nagree, that the less you work butter, and still remove all the milk, the\r\nbetter it will be; and the more you are obliged to work it, the more\r\ngluey, and therefore the poorer the quality. Very good butter is made by\r\nimmediately working all the milk out and salting thoroughly--working the\r\nsalt into every part, without the use of water.\r\n\r\n_Working over_ butter, the next day after churning, should be nothing\r\nmore than nicely forming it into rolls, without any further working or\r\nany more salt. An error, that spoils more butter than any other, is that\r\nof doing very little with butter when it first comes out of the churn,\r\nbecause it must be gone through with the next day. Many do not know why\r\ntheir butter has different colors in the same mass--some white, and some\r\nquite yellow, and all shades between. The reason always is, putting in\r\nthe salt immediately on churning, but neglecting to incorporate that\r\nsalt into every part of the mass equally: thus, where there is most salt\r\nthere will be one color, and where less, another. Another evil is, when\r\nthe salt is thus put in carelessly, while much buttermilk remains, that\r\nsalt dissolves; and when the butter is worked over the next day, the\r\nsalt is mostly worked out, with the milk or water left in, the previous\r\nday. The addition of more salt then will not save it. It has received an\r\ninjury, by retaining the milk or water for twenty-four hours, from which\r\nno future treatment will enable it to recover. We recommend washing as\r\npreferable; it has the following advantages: it cools butter quickly in\r\nwarm weather, bringing it at once into a situation to be properly worked\r\nand salted. The buttermilk is also removed more speedily than in any\r\nother way; this is a great object. It removes the milk with less\r\nworking, and consequently with less injury, than the other method. These\r\nthree advantages, cooling in hot weather, expelling the milk in the\r\nshortest time, and working the butter the least, lead us to prefer using\r\nwater, by one hundred per cent. We have for years used butter that has\r\nbeen made in this way, and never tasted better. Butter made in this way\r\nin summer will keep well till next summer, to our certain knowledge.\r\nImmediately after churning, pour off all the milk and put in half a\r\npailful of water, more or less according to quantity; agitate the whole\r\nwith the dasher, and pour off the water. Repeat this once or twice until\r\nthe water runs off clear, without any coloring from the milk, and nearly\r\nall the buttermilk is out; this can all be done in five minutes after\r\nchurning. Press out the very little water that will remain, and put in\r\nall the salt the butter will require, and work it thoroughly into every\r\npart. All this need occupy no more than ten minutes, and the butter is\r\nset away for putting up in rolls, or packing down in jars the next day.\r\nSuch butter would keep tied up in a bag, and hung in a good airy place.\r\nBest to put it down in a jar, packed close; put a cloth over top, and\r\ncover with half an inch of fine salt. The only difficulty in keeping\r\nbutter grows out of failure to get out all the milk, and thoroughly salt\r\nevery particle, within fifteen minutes after churning. Speedy removal of\r\nbuttermilk and water, and speedy salting, will make any butter keep.\r\n\r\nThis subject is so important, as good butter is such a luxury on every\r\ntable, that we recapitulate the essentials of good butter making:--\r\n\r\n1. Keep everything sweet and clean, and well dried in the sun.\r\n\r\n2. Milk the cows, as nearly as possible, at the same hour, and draw the\r\nmilk very quickly and very clean.\r\n\r\n3. Set the milk, in pans three inches deep, in good air, removed from\r\nanything that might give it an unpleasant flavor, and where it will be\r\nat a temperature of fifty to sixty degrees.\r\n\r\n4. Churn the cream at a temperature of sixty-two degrees.\r\n\r\n5. Get out the buttermilk, and salt thoroughly within fifteen minutes\r\nafter churning, either with water or without, as you prefer. Mix the\r\nsalt thoroughly in every particle. Put up in balls, or pack closely in\r\njars the next day.\r\n\r\n6. Remember to work the butter as little as possible in removing the\r\nmilk; the more it is worked, the more will it be like salve or oil, and\r\nthe poorer the quality: hence, it is better to wash it with cold water,\r\nbecause you can wash out the buttermilk with much less working of the\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n7. To make the best possible quality of butter, use only one third of\r\nthe milk of the cows at each milking, and that the last drawn.\r\n\r\n8. In the winter, when cream does not get sufficiently sour, put in a\r\nlittle lemon-juice or calves' rennet. If too white, put in a little of\r\nthe juice of carrot to give it a yellow hue.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERNUT.\r\n\r\nThis is a rich, pleasant nut, but contains rather too much oil for\r\nhealth. The oil, obtained by compression, is fine for clocks, &c.\r\n\r\nThe root, like the branches, are wide-spreading, and hence injurious to\r\nthe land about them. Two or three trees on some corner not desired for\r\ncultivation, or in the street, will be sufficient. A rough piece of\r\nground, not suitable for cultivation, might be occupied by an orchard of\r\nbutternut-trees, and be profitable for market and as a family luxury.\r\nThe bark is often used as a coloring substance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCABBAGE.\r\n\r\nThe best catalogues of seeds enumerate over twenty varieties, beside the\r\ncauliflowers, borecoles, &c. A few are superior, and should, therefore,\r\nbe cultivated to the exclusion of the others.\r\n\r\nEARLY YORK is best for early use. It is earlier than any other, and with\r\nproper treatment nearly every plant will form a small, compact, solid\r\nhead, tender, and of delicious flavor. No garden is complete without it.\r\n\r\nEARLY DUTCH, AND EARLY SUGARLOAF, come next in season to the Early York,\r\nproducing much larger heads.\r\n\r\nLARGE YORK is a good variety, maturing later than the preceding, and\r\nbefore the late drumheads.\r\n\r\nLarge Drumhead, Late Drumhead, or Large Flat Dutch, are the best for\r\nwinter and spring use. There are many varieties under these names, so\r\nthat cultivators often get disappointed in purchasing seeds. It is now\r\ndifficult to describe cabbages intelligibly. Every worthless hybrid goes\r\nunder some excellent name.\r\n\r\nA Dutch cabbage, with a short stem and very small at the ground, is the\r\nbest with which we are acquainted. Of this variety (the seed of which\r\nwas brought from Germany), we have raised solid heads, larger than a\r\nhalf bushel, while others called good, standing by their side, did not\r\ngrow to more than half that size. This variety may be distinguished by\r\nthe purple on the top of the grown head, and by the decided purple of\r\nthe young plants, resembling the Red Dutch, though not of quite so deep\r\na color.\r\n\r\nRED DUTCH, having a very hard, small head, deep purple throughout, is\r\nthe very best for pickling; every garden should have a few. They are\r\nalso good for ordinary purposes.\r\n\r\nGREEN CURLED SAVOY, when well grown, is a good variety.\r\n\r\nThe _Imperial_, the _Russian_, Large Scotch for feeding, and others, are\r\nenumerated and described, but are inferior to the above. It is useless\r\nto endeavor to grow cabbages on any but the best of soil. Plant corn on\r\npoor land, and it will mature and yield a small crop. Plant cabbages on\r\nsimilar soil, and you will get nothing but a few leaves for cattle.\r\nTherefore, if your land designed for cabbages be not already very rich,\r\nput a load of stable-manure on each square rod. Cabbages are a very\r\nexhausting crop. The soil should be worked fully eighteen inches deep,\r\nand have manure well mixed with the whole. The best preparation we ever\r\nmade was by double-plowing--not subsoiling, but plowing twice with\r\nsimilar plows: put on a good coat of manure, and plow with two teams in\r\nthe same furrow, one plow gauged so as to turn a light furrow, and the\r\nother a very deep one, throwing it out of the bottom of the first; when\r\nthe first plow comes round, it will throw the light furrow into the\r\nbottom of the deep one. This repeated over the whole plot will stir the\r\nsoil sixteen or eighteen inches deep, and put from four to six inches of\r\nthe top, manure and all, in the bottom, under the other. We have done\r\nthis admirably with one plow, changing the gauge of the clevis every\r\ntime round, and going twice in a furrow: this is the best way for those\r\nwho use but one team in plowing; it is worth much more than the\r\nadditional time required in plowing. Enrich the surface a little with\r\nfine manure, and you have land in the best possible condition for\r\ncabbages. This is a fine preparation for onions and other garden\r\nvegetables, and for all kinds of berries. Subsoiling is good, but\r\ndouble-plowing is better in all cases, where you can afford to enrich\r\nthe surface, after this deep plowing.\r\n\r\nThe alluvial soils of the West need no enriching after double-plowing.\r\nLand so level, or having so hard a subsoil as to allow water to stand on\r\nit in a wet season, is not good for cabbages. They also suffer more than\r\nmost crops from drought. One of the most important offices of plenty of\r\nmanure is its control of the moisture. Land well manured does not so\r\nsoon feel the effects of drought. One of the best means of preserving\r\nmoisture about the roots of cabbages, is to put a little manure in the\r\nbottom of the holes when transplanting; put it six inches below the\r\nsurface. Manure from a spent hotbed is excellent for this purpose; it is\r\nin the best condition about the time for transplanting cabbages. It is\r\nthen very wet, and has a wonderful power of retaining the moisture.\r\nManure from the blacksmith-shop, containing hoof-parings, &c., is very\r\ngood. If the manure be too dry, pour in water and cover immediately. Set\r\nthe plant in the soil, over the manure, the roots extending down into\r\nit, with a little fine mould mixed in it, and it will retain moisture\r\nthrough a severe drought; no further watering will be necessary, and not\r\none out of twenty-five of all your plants will fail to make a good head.\r\nIn climates subject to drought in summer, cabbages should be set out\r\nearlier; they require more time in dry weather than in wet. Should they\r\nincline to crack open from too rapid growth, raise them a little, and\r\npush them down again; this will break some roots, and so loosen the\r\nremainder that the growth will be checked and the heads saved. Winter\r\ncabbages should be allowed to stand in the ground as long as possible,\r\nwithout danger of freezing in. The question of transplanting, and of\r\nsowing the seed in the places where they are designed to head, has been\r\nmuch controverted. We have succeeded well in both ways, but prefer\r\ntransplanting; it gives opportunity to stir the ground deep, and keep\r\ndown weeds, and thus preserve moisture until summer, when it is time to\r\ntransplant; it also makes shorter, smaller, and straighter stems, which\r\nis favorable to a larger growth of heads. Sow seed on poor land; the\r\nplants will be straighter, more hardy, and less affected by insects.\r\nSeed for early spring cabbages should be sown on poor soil in September\r\nor October; if inclined to get too forward, transplant, once or twice;\r\nlate in fall, set them close together, lay poles in forks of limbs put\r\ndown for the purpose, and cover with straw, as a protection from severe\r\nfrost; the poles are to prevent the covering from lying on the plants.\r\n\r\n_Preserving_, for winter or spring use, is best done by plowing a furrow\r\non land where water will not stand, and placing the heads in the furrow\r\nwith the roots up. Cover with earth from three to six inches deep,\r\nletting the roots protrude. The large leaves will convey all the water\r\noff from the heads, and they will come out as fresh and good as in the\r\nfall. If you wish some, more easily accessible, for winter use, set them\r\nin the cellar in a small trench, in which a little water should be kept,\r\nand they will not only be preserved fresh, but will grow all winter, if\r\nthe cellar be free from frost. They are also well preserved put in\r\ntrenches eighteen inches deep, out door, with a little good soil in the\r\nbottom, and protected with poles and straw as directed for winter\r\nplants. Cabbages that have scarcely any heads in the fall, so treated,\r\nwill grow all winter, and come out good, tender, fresh heads in spring.\r\n\r\n_Transplanting._--This is usually done in wet weather: if it be so wet\r\nas to render the soil muddy by stirring, it injures the plants. This may\r\nbe successfully done in dry weather, not excessively hot. Have a basin\r\nof water, in which dip the root and shake it, so as to wash off all the\r\nearth from the seed-bed that adheres to it. Put the plant in its place\r\nat once, and the soil in which it is to grow takes hold of the roots\r\nreadily, and nearly every one will live. Transplant with your hand, a\r\ntransplanting trowel, a stick, or a dibble made of a spade-handle, one\r\nfoot long, sharpened off abruptly, and the eye left on for a handle. Put\r\nthe plant in its place, thrust the dibble down at a sharp angle with the\r\nplant, and below it, and move it up to it. The soil will thus be pressed\r\nclose around the roots, leaving no open space, and the plant will grow.\r\nDo not leave the roots so long that they will be doubled up in\r\ntransplanting--better cut off the ends.\r\n\r\nLarge cabbages should be three feet apart each way, and in perfectly\r\nstraight rows; this saves expense in cultivating, as it can be done with\r\na horse. The usual objections of farmers to gardening, on account of the\r\ntime required to hoe and weed, would be remedied by planting in long,\r\nstraight rows, at suitable distances apart, to allow the free use of\r\nhorse, cultivator, and plow, in cultivating; thus, beets, carrots,\r\ncabbages, onions, &c., are almost as easily raised as corn. An easy\r\nmethod of raising good cabbages is on greensward. Put on a good dressing\r\nof manure, plow once and turn over handsomely, roll level, and harrow\r\nvery mellow on the top, without disturbing the turf below; make places\r\nfor planting seeds at the bottom of the turf; a little stirring of the\r\nsurface, and destruction of the few weeds that will grow, will be all\r\nthe further care necessary. The roots will extend under the sod in the\r\nmanure below it, and will there find plenty of moisture, even when the\r\nsurface is quite dry, and will grow profusely.\r\n\r\n_Seed._--Nothing is more difficult in cabbage culture than raising pure\r\nseed; nothing hybridizes worse, and in nothing else is the effect worse.\r\nIt must not be raised in the same garden with anything else of the\r\ncabbage or turnip kind; they will mix in the blossoms, and the worse\r\nwill prevail. Raise seeds only from the best heads, and only one\r\nvariety; break off all the lower shoots, allowing only a few of the best\r\nto mature. Seeds raised from stumps, from which the head has been\r\nremoved for use, will incline the leaves to grow down, as we often see,\r\ninstead of closing up into heads.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALVES.\r\n\r\nThe best method of raising calves is of much importance. It controls the\r\nvalue and beauty of grown cattle. Stint the growth of a calf, and when\r\nhe is old he will not recover from it. Much attention has been paid to\r\nthe breed of cattle, and some are very highly recommended. It is true\r\nthat the breed of stock has much to do with its excellence. It is\r\nequally true that the care taken with calves and young cattle, has quite\r\nas much to do with it. We can take any common breed, and by great care\r\nin raising, have quite as good cattle, for market or use, as can\r\nanother, who has the best breed in the world, but keeps them\r\nindifferently. But good breeds and good keeping make splendid animals,\r\nand will constantly improve them. The old adage, \"Anything worth doing\r\nat all, is worth doing well\" is nowhere more true, than in the care of\r\ncalves. We shall not pause to present the various and contradictory\r\nmethods of raising calves, that are presented in the numerous books, on\r\nthe subject, that have come under our observation. Hay-tea, various\r\npreparations of linseed-meal, oilcake-meal, oatmeal, and every variety\r\nof ground feed, sometimes mixed up with gin, or some kind of cheap\r\nspirits (for the purpose of keeping calves quiet), are recommended. The\r\ndiscussion of the merits of these, would be of no practical benefit to\r\nour readers.\r\n\r\nThe following brief directions are sufficient:--\r\n\r\n1. Seldom raise late calves. Their place is in the butcher's shop, after\r\nthey are five weeks old.\r\n\r\n2. Raise only those calves that are well formed. Straight back, small\r\nneck, not very tall, and a good expression of countenance, are the best\r\nmarks.\r\n\r\n3. Let every calf suck its dam two days. It is for the health of the\r\ncalf and the good of the cow.\r\n\r\n4. To fatten a calf, let it suck one half the milk for two weeks, three\r\nfourths the third, and the whole the fourth. Continue it another week,\r\nand the veal will be better. But we think it preferable to take calves\r\noff from the cow after two days. Feed them the milk warm from the cow,\r\nand give them some warm food at noon. Feed three times a day, they will\r\nfatten faster. It also gives opportunity to put oatmeal in their food\r\nafter the second week, which will improve the veal, and give you a\r\nlittle milk, if you desire it. Our first method is easier, and our last\r\nbetter, for fattening calves.\r\n\r\n5. To raise calves for stock, take them from the cows after the second\r\nday. Feed them half the milk (if the cow gives a reasonable quantity)\r\nfor the first two weeks. Begin then to put in a little oatmeal. After\r\ntwo weeks more, give one fourth of the milk, and increase the quantity\r\nof meal. When the calf is eight or ten weeks old, feed it only on meal\r\nand such skimmed milk, sour milk, or buttermilk, as you may have to\r\nspare. This is the course when the object is to save milk. If not, let\r\nthe calf have the whole, with such addition of meal as you think\r\ndesirable. The easiest way to raise calves, when you do not desire the\r\nmilk for the family or dairy, is to let them run with the cows and have\r\nall the milk when they please.\r\n\r\nOthers let them suck a part of the milk, and feed them with meal, &c.,\r\nbesides. This is difficult. If you milk your own share first, you will\r\nleave much less for the calf than you suppose. If he gets his portion\r\nfirst, he will be sure to get a part of yours also. This can only be\r\nwell done by allowing the calf to suck all the udders, but not clean.\r\nThe remainder, being the last of the milk will make the best of butter.\r\nBut it is difficult to regulate it as you please, and more difficult to\r\nfeed a calf properly, that sucks, than one that depends wholly upon what\r\nyou feed him. Hence it is preferable to feed all your calves, whether\r\nfor veal or stock. A little oilcake pulverized is a valuable addition.\r\nIndian-meal and the coarse flour of wheat are good for calves, but not\r\nequal to oatmeal. Good calves have been raised on gruels made of these\r\nmeals, without any milk after the first two weeks.\r\n\r\n6. In winter, feed chopped roots and meal, mixed with plenty of hay and\r\npure water, and always from a month old give salt twice a week.\r\n\r\n7. If calves are inclined to purge or scour, as the farmers call it, put\r\na little rennet in their food. If they are costive, put in a little\r\nmelted lard, or some kind of inoffensive oil. These will prove effectual\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, very little danger of disease, to calves, well,\r\nregularly, and properly fed, as above.\r\n\r\nFat calves are not apt to have lice. But should such a thing occur,\r\nwashing in tobacco-water is a speedy and perfect remedy.\r\n\r\n8. During cold nights in fall, and all of the first winter, calves\r\nshould be shut up in a warm dry place. Keep them curried clean.\r\n\r\nThe cold and wet of the first winter are very injurious. After they are\r\na year old they will give very little trouble. The great difficulty with\r\ncalves is a want of enough to eat. They should not only be kept\r\ngrowing, but fat, all the first year. They will then make fine,\r\nhealthy, and profitable animals.\r\n\r\nChalk or dry yellow loam, placed within their reach is very useful. They\r\nwill eat of it, enough to correct the excessive acidity of their\r\nstomachs. The operation of changing calves into oxen, should be\r\nperformed before they are twenty days old. It will then be only slightly\r\ninjurious.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANS.\r\n\r\nThese are much used for preserving fruits and vegetables. There are a\r\nnumber of patent articles said to work well. They are, in our opinion,\r\nmore expensive, and more likely to fail in inexperienced hands, than\r\nthose that an ordinary tinman can readily make. The best invention for\r\ngeneral use is that that is most simple. Cans should be made in\r\ncylindrical form, with an orifice in the top large enough to admit\r\nwhatever you wish to preserve, and should contain about two quarts. Fill\r\nthe cans and solder on the top, leaving an opening as large as a\r\npin-head, from which steam may escape. Set the cans in water nearly to\r\ntheir tops, and gradually increase the heat under them until the water\r\nbegins to boil. Take out the cans, drop solder on the opening, and all\r\nwill be air-tight. This operation requires at least three hours, as the\r\nheating must be moderate. You may preserve in glass bottles, filling and\r\nputting in a cork very tight, and well tied, and gradually heating as\r\nabove; this will require four hours, as glass will be in danger of\r\nbursting by too rapid heating. But for tomatoes, or anything that you\r\nhave no objection to boiling and seasoning before preserving, the best\r\nway is to prepare and cook as for the table, putting in only pepper and\r\nsalt, and fill cans while the mass is boiling, and, with a sealing-wax\r\nthat you can get at any druggist's laid around the orifice, place the\r\ncover upon it; the heat will melt the wax, and when it cools, the cover\r\nwill be fastened, and all will be air-tight. This will require no\r\nprocess of slow boiling. Set the cans or bottles in a cool cellar, and\r\nwhatever they contain may be taken out, at the end of a year, as good as\r\nwhen put in. The last method is the best and most simple of all. The\r\nwhole principle of preserving is to make the cans air-tight.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARROTS.\r\n\r\nThese are cultivated for the table, and for food for animals. Boiled and\r\npickled, or eaten with an ordinary boiled dish, they are esteemed. They\r\nare really excellent in soups. As a root for animals, they are very\r\nvaluable. They are often preferred to beets;--this is a mistake--four\r\npounds of beet are equal to five pounds of carrot for feeding to\r\ndomestic animals. Work the soil for carrots very deep, make it very rich\r\nwith stable manure, with a mixture of lime; harrow fine and mellow, and\r\nroll entirely smooth. Plant with a seed-sower, that the rows may be\r\nstraight; rows two feet apart will allow a horse and small cultivator to\r\npass between them. Planted one foot apart, and cultivated with a horse,\r\nand a cultivator that will take three rows at once, they will yield much\r\nmore to the acre, and may be cultivated at a moderate expense,\r\nexceeding but a little that of ordinary field-crops. Sow as early as\r\nconvenient, as the longer time they have, the larger will be the\r\nproduct. They grow until hard frosts, whenever you may sow them. There\r\nare several varieties, but the Long Orange is the only one that it is\r\never best to grow; it is richer than the white, and yields as well: the\r\nearlier sorts are no better, as the carrot may be used at any stage of\r\nits growth. They should be kept in the ground as long as it is safe.\r\nThey will stand hard frosts, but, if too much frozen, they are inclined\r\nto rot in winter. Dig in fair weather, dry in the sun, and keep dry. It\r\nis the best of all root crops, except the beet. All animals will eat it\r\nfreely, while they have to acquire a taste for the beet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAULIFLOWER.\r\n\r\nThe two varieties known in this country are the English and the\r\nFrench--distinguished, also, as early and late. The French only is\r\nsuitable for cultivation here; especially in the colder regions, as it\r\nis earlier. This is cultivated in every way like cabbage. In several\r\nrespects it is preferable to cabbage; it has a more pleasant flavor, and\r\nis more easy of digestion. It is excellent for pickling. Seeds may be\r\nraised in the same way, and with the same precautions, as cabbage; but\r\nit is generally imported.\r\n\r\n\r\nCELERY.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the finest of our table vegetables, eaten raw with salt,\r\nor in soups. Sow seed, early in spring, in open ground; or sow in\r\nhotbeds, if you wish it very early. When the plants are six inches high,\r\nthey should be transplanted in trenches eighteen inches deep, containing\r\nsix inches of well-rotted manure or compost. This should be well\r\nwatered, and fine mould mixed with it, and the plants placed in it eight\r\ninches apart. The trenches should be from four to six feet apart. If the\r\nweather be warm and sun bright at the time of transplanting, a board\r\nlaid lengthwise over the top of the trench will afford perfect\r\nprotection. As the plants grow, draw the earth up to them, not allowing\r\nit to separate the leaves; do this two or three times during the season,\r\nand the stalks will be beautifully bleached. Heavy loam is much better\r\nthan sand.\r\n\r\n_Preserving_ for winter is best done by taking up late in the fall,\r\ncutting the small roots off, and rounding down to a point the large\r\nroot, removing the coarse, useless leaves, and placing in a trench at an\r\nangle of forty-five degrees, so that six inches of the upper end of the\r\nleaves will be above the surface. Cover with soil and place poles over,\r\nand cover with straw, and in a very cold climate cover with earth. Keep\r\nout the water. The end can be opened to take it out whenever you please,\r\nand it will be as fresh as in the fall. This is better than the methods\r\nof keeping in the cellar; it is more certain, and keeps the celery in\r\nperfect condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE.\r\n\r\nThe methods of cheese-making differ materially in different countries,\r\nand in different parts of the same country. It is also so much a matter\r\nof experience and observation, that we recommend to beginners to visit\r\ncheese-dairies, and get instructions from practical makers. But we give\r\nthe following more general outlines, leaving our readers to learn all\r\nfurther details as recommended above.\r\n\r\nRennet, or the calf's stomach, is used, as nature's agent to turn the\r\nmilk, or to curdle it without having it sour. There are many fanciful\r\nways of preparing the rennet, putting in sweet herbs, &c. But the\r\nordinary plain method is quite sufficient--which is, to steep it in cold\r\nsalt water. The milk should be set at once on coming from the cow.\r\nSetting it too hot, or cooling it with cold water, inclines the cheese\r\nto heave. Too much rennet gives it a strong, unpleasant smell and taste.\r\nBreak the curd as fine as possible with the hand or dish, or better with\r\na regular cheese-knife with three blades. This is especially important\r\nin making large cheeses; small ones need less care in this respect. If\r\nthe curd be too soft, scald it with very hot whey or water; if it be\r\nhard, use a little more than blood-warm whey: it should stand a few\r\nminutes in this whey and then be separated, and the curd put into the\r\ncheese-hoop, making it heaped full, and pressed hard with the hand.\r\nSpread a cloth over it, and turn it out. Wash the hoop and put back the\r\ncheese, with the cloth between the curd and the hoop, and put it in the\r\npress. After a few hours take it out, wash the cloth and put it again\r\naround the cheese, and return it to the press. After seven or eight\r\nhours more take it out again, pare off the edges if they need it, and\r\nrub salt all over it--as much as it will take in: this is the best way\r\nof salting cheese; the moisture in it at this stage will cause it to\r\nabsorb just about as much salt as will be agreeable. Return it to the\r\npress in the hoop without the cloth; let it stand in the press over\r\nnight; in the morning turn it in the hoop, and continue it in the press\r\nuntil the next morning. Place it upon the shelf in the cheese-room, and\r\nturn it every day, or at least every other day. If the weather be hot,\r\nthe doors and windows of the cheese-room should be shut; if cool, they\r\nshould be open to admit air.\r\n\r\n_Color._--The richest is supposed to be about that of beeswax. This is\r\nproduced by annotta, or otter, rubbed into the milk at the time of\r\nsetting, when warm from the cow--or, if the milk has stood till cold,\r\nafter it has been warmed. Cold milk must, before setting, be warmed to\r\nabout blood or milk heat. This coloring process has no virtue but in its\r\ninfluence on the looks of the cheese. Sage cheese is colored by the\r\njuice of pounded sage-leaves put into the fine curd before it is put in\r\nthe hoop; this is the reason of its appearing in streaks, as it would\r\nnot do if put into the milk, like the annotta. When the cheese is ten\r\ndays old, it should be soaked in cold whey until the rind becomes soft,\r\nand then scraped smooth with a case-knife; then rinse, and wipe and dry\r\nit, and return it to the cheese-room, and turn it often until dry enough\r\nfor market. Rich cheeses are apt to spread in warm weather; this is\r\nprevented by sewing them in common cheap cotton, exactly fitting.\r\n\r\n_Skippers._--Some persons are very fond of skippery cheese. But few,\r\nhowever, like meat and milk together, especially if the meat be alive:\r\nhence, to remove skippers from cheese into which they have intruded is\r\nquite desirable. The following method is effectual:--wrap up the cheese\r\nin thin paper, through which moisture will readily strike; dig a hole\r\ntwo feet deep in pure earth, and bury the cheese;--in thirty-six hours\r\nevery skipper will be on the outside; brush them off and keep the cheese\r\nfrom the flies, and you will have no further trouble. A mixture of\r\nSpanish brown and butter, rubbed on the outside of a cheese, frequently\r\ngives that yellow coating so often witnessed, and exerts some influence\r\nin preserving it. The rank and putrid taste sometimes observed in cheese\r\nmay be prevented by putting a spoonful of salt in the bottom of each\r\npan, before straining the milk; it will also preserve the milk in hot\r\nweather, and give more curd.\r\n\r\nAn English cheese called \"Stilton cheese,\" from the name of the place\r\nmost celebrated for making it, is a superior article, made in the\r\nfollowing way: put the cream of the night's milk with the morning's\r\nmilk; remove the curd with the least possible disturbance, and without\r\nbreaking; drain and gradually dry it in a sieve; compress it gradually\r\nuntil it becomes firm; put it in a wooden hop on a board, to dry\r\ngradually; it should be often turned between binders, top and bottom, to\r\nbe tightened as the cheese grows smaller. This makes the finest cheese\r\nknown. As the size makes no difference, it can be made by a person\r\nhaving but one cow.\r\n\r\nTo preserve cheese, keep it from flies, and in a place not so damp as to\r\ncause mould. Of cheese-pressers there is a great variety: each maker\r\nwill select the one which he considers best or most convenient, within\r\nhis reach. In some places, as on the Western Reserve, in Ohio, one\r\nestablishment makes all the cheese for the neighborhood, buying the curd\r\nfrom all the families around. In such places they have their own\r\nmethods, which they have understood by all their customers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRY.\r\n\r\nCherries are among our first luxuries in the line of fruits. We have\r\ncultivated varieties, ripening in succession throughout the cherry\r\nseason. There is no necessity for cultivating the common red and very\r\nacid cherry, except in climates too vigorous for the more tender\r\ncultivated varieties. The cherry is an ornamental tree, making a\r\nbeautiful shade, besides the luxury of its fruit. It is one of the most\r\nsuitable trees we have for the roadside;--it ought to be extensively\r\nplanted by the highways throughout all our rural districts, as it is in\r\nsome parts of Europe. In northern Germany the highways are avenues,\r\nshaded with cherry-trees for distances of fifty or sixty miles together:\r\nthese trees have been planted by direction of the princes, and afford\r\nshade and refreshment to the weary pedestrian, who is always at liberty\r\nto eat as much of the fruit as he pleases; this is eminently worthy of\r\nimitation in our own country.\r\n\r\nExtremes of cold and heat are not favorable to the cherry: hence, cool\r\nplaces must be selected in hot countries, and warm locations in cold\r\nregions. Very much, however, can be done by acclimation; it will,\r\nprobably, yet naturalize the cherry throughout the continent. A deep\r\nand moderately rich loam is the best soil for the cherry; very rich soil\r\ncauses too rapid growth, which makes the tree tender. It will bear more\r\nmoisture than the grape or peach, and requires less than the apple or\r\npear. It will endure very dry situations tolerably well, while in very\r\nwet ones it will soon perish.\r\n\r\n_Propagation_ is generally by budding small trees near the ground. The\r\nbest stocks are those raised from the seeds of the common black Mazzard.\r\nIt makes a more thrifty tree than any other. The tree grows very large,\r\nand bears an abundance of medium black fruit, smallest at the blossom\r\nend, and having seeds very large in proportion to the size of the fruit.\r\nIn White's Gardening for the South, it is stated that the common Morello\r\nof that region does better, by far, for seedling stocks for budding,\r\nthan the Mazzard. Use, then, the Mazzard for the North, and the Mahaleb\r\nor common Morello for the South. Pick them when ripe; let them stand two\r\nor three days, till the pulp decays enough to separate easily from the\r\nseed by washing. Immediately plant the seeds in rows where you wish them\r\nto grow; this is better than keeping them over winter in sand, as a\r\nlittle neglect in spring will spoil them, they are so tender, when they\r\nbegin to germinate. Keep them clean of weeds. The next spring, set them\r\nin rows ten inches or a foot apart, placing the different sizes by\r\nthemselves, that large ones need not overshadow small ones and prevent\r\ntheir growth. In the following August, or on the last of July, bud them\r\nnear the ground. The stocks are to be headed back the following spring,\r\nand the bud will make five or six feet of growth the same season. The\r\ncherry-tree seldom needs pruning, further than to pinch off any little\r\nshoots that may come out in a wrong place (and they will be very few),\r\nand cut away dead branches. Any removal of large limbs will produce gum,\r\nwhich is apt to end in decay, and finally in the death of the tree.\r\nWhatever pruning you must do, do it in the hottest summer weather, and\r\nthe wounds will dry and prevent the exudation of gum. Trees are\r\ngenerally trained horizontally. Some, however, are trained as espaliers\r\nagainst walls, and in fan shape. When once the form is perfected (as\r\ngiven under Training), nothing is necessary but to cut off--twice in\r\neach season, about six weeks apart, in the most growing time--all other\r\nshoots that come out within four inches of their base. New shoots will\r\nbe constantly springing, and the tree will keep its shape and bear\r\nexcellent fruit. Trees so trained are usually in warm locations, and\r\nwhere they can be easily protected in winter; hence, this is adapted to\r\nthe finer and more tender varieties. The varieties of cherries are\r\nnumerous, and rapidly increasing. They are less distinguishable than\r\nmost other fruits. We shall only present a few of the best, and give\r\nonly their general qualities, without any effort to enable our readers\r\nto identify varieties. (See our remarks on the nomenclature of apples.)\r\n\r\nDowning, in 1846, recommended the following, as choice and hardy,\r\nadapted to the middle states:--\r\n\r\n  1. Black Tartarean.\r\n  2. Black Eagle.\r\n  3. Early White Heart.\r\n  4. Downton.\r\n  5. Downer's Late.\r\n  6. Manning's Mottled.\r\n  7. Flesh-color'd Bigarreau\r\n  8. Elton.\r\n  9. Belle de Choisy.\r\n  10. May Duke.\r\n  11. Kentish.\r\n  12. Knight's Early Black.\r\n\r\nThe National Convention of Fruit-growers recommend the following as the\r\nbest for the whole country:--\r\n\r\n  1. May Duke.\r\n  2. Black Tartarean.\r\n  3. Black Eagle.\r\n  4. Bigarreau.\r\n  5. Knight's Early Black.\r\n  6. Downer.\r\n  7. Elton.\r\n  8. Downton.\r\n\r\nWe recommend the following as all that need be cultivated for profit.\r\nThey are adapted alike to the field and the garden. We omit the\r\nsynonyms, and give only the predominant color. The figures in the cuts\r\nrefer to our numbers in the list:--\r\n\r\n    Name.                           Color.

July 5th.\r\n\r\nThe time is that of their greatest perfection, but varies with latitude\r\nand location.\r\n\r\nWe know none better than the foregoing. In the long lists of the\r\nfruit-books, there are others of great excellence, some of which are\r\nhardly distinguishable from our list. We recommend to all cultivators to\r\nprocure the best in their localities, under the advice of the best\r\npomologists in their vicinity. Such men as Barry will be consulted for\r\nthe latitude of Western New York; Elliott and Kirtland for Cleveland,\r\nOhio; Cole and others for New England and Canada; Hooker and other\r\ngreat fruit-growers of Southern Ohio, &c., &c. These gentlemen, like all\r\nscientific men, are happy to communicate their knowledge for the benefit\r\nof others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cherries--Natural Size and Shape. (See page 121.)]\r\n\r\nWe see no reason for cultivating more than ten or twelve varieties; and,\r\nas the above are productive and excellent, including all desirable\r\ncolors and qualities, and ripening through the whole cherry season, we\r\nknow not what more would be profitable to the cultivator. If you wish\r\nmore for the sake of variety, your nurseryman will name them, and show\r\nthe quality of each, that renders it \"_the best_ that ever was,\" until\r\nyou will become tired of hearing, and more weary of paying for them.\r\n\r\nDecayed wood, spent tanbark, and forest-leaves, are good for the cherry.\r\nIn removing and transplanting, be careful not to injure the roots, or\r\nexpose them to sun and air, as they are so tender, that a degree of\r\nexposure that would be little felt by the apple or peach tree will\r\ndestroy the cherry. If you are going to keep a cherry-tree out of the\r\nground half an hour, throw a damp mat, or damp straw, over the roots,\r\nand you will save disappointment. The rich alluvial soils of the West\r\nare regarded unfavorable to the cherry. We know from observation and\r\nexperience that the common red cherry does exceedingly well there, while\r\nthe best cultivated are apt to suffer much from the winters. One reason\r\nis, the common cherry is a slow-going, hardy tree, while the cultivated\r\nis more thrifty, and therefore more tender. We give the following as a\r\n_sure method_ of raising the cultivated cherries in great perfection on\r\nall the rich prairies of the West. It is all included in dry locations,\r\nroot-pruning, and slight heading-in:--\r\n\r\n1. Dry locations. It is known that the rich alluvial soils of the West\r\nare remarkable for retaining water in winter. On level, and even high\r\nprairie land, water will stand in winter, and thoroughly saturate the\r\nsoil and freeze up. This is very destructive to the tender, porous root\r\nof the cherry-tree. How shall such locations be made dry, and these\r\nevils prevented? By carting on gravel and sand. Put two or three loads\r\nof sand or gravel, or both, in the shape of a slight mound, for each\r\ncherry-tree. There should first be a slight excavation, that the sand\r\nand gravel may be about half below the level of the surrounding soil,\r\nand half above it: this will so elevate the tree that no water can stand\r\naround it, and none can stand in the gravel and sand below it. The\r\nfreezing of such soil will not be injurious to the roots of the tree.\r\n\r\n2. Root-pruning is to prevent too rapid growth. Such growth is always\r\nmore tender and susceptible of injury from sudden and severe freezing.\r\n(See Root-pruning.)\r\n\r\n3. Heading-in puts back the growth and throws the sap into the lateral\r\ntwigs, thus maturing the wood already grown, instead of producing new\r\nwood, so young and tender that it will die in winter and spread decay\r\nthrough the whole tree. Heading-in, with the cherry, must only be done\r\nwith small twigs. Cultivators will see at a glance that this method will\r\ncertainly succeed in all the West and Southwest.\r\n\r\nIt is considered difficult to raise cherries at the South; the hot sun\r\ndestroys the trees. Plant in the coolest situations, where there is a\r\nlittle shade from other trees, though not too near, or from buildings;\r\ncut them back, so as to cause shoots near the ground, and then head-in\r\nas the peach, so as to keep the whole covered with leaves, to shade the\r\ntrunk and large limbs, and perfect success will crown your efforts. But\r\nin all cutting-back and heading-in of cherry-trees, remove the limbs\r\nwhen very small.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARCOAL.\r\n\r\nThere are but few who realize the value of charcoal applied to the soil.\r\nWhoever will observe fields where coal has been burned, will see that\r\ngrass or grain about the bed of the former pits, will be earlier and\r\nmuch more luxuriant than in any other portion of the field. This\r\ndifference is discernible for twenty years. It is the best known agent\r\nfor absorbing any noxious matter in the soil or in the moisture about\r\nthe roots of the trees. No peach-tree should be planted without a few\r\nquarts of pulverized charcoal in the soil. This would also prove highly\r\nbeneficial to cherry-trees on land where they might be exposed to too\r\nmuch moisture. Its color also renders it an excellent application to the\r\nsurface of hills of vines. It is quite effectual against the ravages of\r\ninsects, and so absorbs the rays of the sun as to promote a rapid growth\r\nof the plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHESTNUTS\r\n\r\nAre among our best nuts, if not allowed to get too dry. When dried hard\r\nthey are rather indigestible. The tree grows well in most parts of the\r\nUnited States, provided the soil be light sand or dry gravel. If the\r\nsoil be not suitable, every man may have a half-dozen chestnut-trees, at\r\na trifling expense. Haul ten or fifteen loads of sand upon a square rod,\r\nand plant a tree in it, and it will flourish well. Five or six trees\r\nwould afford the children in a family a great luxury, annually. The\r\nblossoms appear so very late, that they are seldom cut off by the frost.\r\nThe second growth chestnut-tree is also decidedly ornamental.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIDER.\r\n\r\nThe usual careless way of making cider, in which is used all kinds of\r\napples, even frozen and decayed ones, and without any reference to their\r\nripeness; without straining, and neglecting all means of regulating the\r\nfermentation, is too well known. This is the more general practice\r\nthroughout the country; but it makes cider only fit for vinegar,\r\nalthough it is used for general purposes. We give the most approved\r\nmethod of making and keeping cider, that is better for invalids than any\r\nof our adulterated wines (and this is the character of nearly all our\r\nimported wines). Our domestic wines, and bottled cider, should take the\r\nplace of all others.\r\n\r\nSelect apples best suited for cider, and gather them at the commencement\r\nof hard frosts. Let them lie a few days, until they become ripe and\r\nsoft. Then throw out all decayed and immature fruit. Grind fine and\r\nuniform. Let the pulp remain in the vat two days. It will increase the\r\nsaccharine principle and improve the color. Put into the press in dry\r\nstraw, and strain the juice into clean casks. Place the casks in an open\r\nshed or cellar, if it be cold weather, give plenty of air and leave the\r\nbung out. As the froth works out of the bung, fill up every day or two,\r\nwith some of the same pressing kept for the purpose. In three weeks or\r\nless this rising will cease, and the bung should be put in loose, and\r\nafter three days driven in tight. Leave a small vent-hole near the bung.\r\nIn a cool cellar the fermentation will cease in two days. This is known\r\nby the clearness of the liquor, the thick scum that rises, and the\r\ncessation of the escape of air.\r\n\r\nDraw off the clear cider into a clean cask. If it remains quiet it may\r\nstand till spring. A gill of fine charcoal added to a barrel will secure\r\nthis end, and prevent fermentation from going too far. But if a scum\r\ncollects on the surface, and the fermentation continues, rack it off\r\nagain at once. Then drive the vent-spile tight. Rack it off again in\r\nearly spring. If not perfectly clear, dissolve three quarters of an\r\nounce of isinglass in cider, and put it in the barrel, and it will soon\r\nbe perfectly fine. Bottle between this and the last of May. Fill the\r\nbottles within an inch of the bottom of the cork, and allow them to\r\nstand an hour, then drive the cork. Lay them in dry sand, in boxes in a\r\ncool cellar, and the cider will improve by age, and is better for the\r\nsick than imported wines.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITRONS\r\n\r\nAre only used for preserving. Their appearance and growth resemble in\r\nall respects the watermelon. Planted near the latter, they utterly ruin\r\nthem, making them more citron than melon. They are injurious to most\r\nother contiguous vines. They are to be planted and cultivated like the\r\nwatermelon. Are very fine preserved; but we think the outside (removing\r\nthe rind) of a watermelon better, and should not regret to know, that\r\nnot another citron was ever to be raised.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOVER.\r\n\r\nThe only varieties successfully cultivated in this country, are the red\r\nand the white. Red clovers are divided into large, medium, and small.\r\nThe white is all alike. The long-rooted clover of Hungary is an\r\nexcellent productive variety, enduring successfully almost any degree of\r\ndrought. But in all the colder parts of this country it winter-kills so\r\nbadly as to render it unprofitable. Clover makes good pastures, being\r\nnutritious, and early and rapid growing. Red-clover makes fair hay,\r\nthough inferior to timothy or red-top. White clover is unsuitable for\r\nhay; it shrinks so much in drying, that it is very unproductive. It is\r\nthe best of all grasses for sheep pasture, and its blossoms afford in\r\nabundance the best of honey. Red clover plowed in, even when full-grown,\r\nis an excellent fertilizer. It begins to be regarded, in western New\r\nYork, as productive of the weevil, so destructive to wheat. Further\r\nobservation is necessary to settle this question.\r\n\r\nRed-clover hay is too dusty for horses, and too wasteful for cattle. The\r\nstalks are so large a proportion, and so slightly nutritious, that it is\r\nunprofitable even as cut-feed. It is best to cultivate clover mainly for\r\npastures and as a fertilizer. Sowing clover and timothy together for hay\r\nis much practised. The first year it will be nearly all clover, and the\r\nsecond year mostly timothy. But sown together, they are not good for\r\nhay, because they do not mature within ten or fifteen days of the same\r\ntime. But, for those who are determined to make hay out of red clover,\r\nthe following directions for curing may be valuable: mow when dry,\r\nspread at once, and let it wilt thoroughly; then put up into small\r\ncocks, not rolled, but one fork full _laid_ upon another until high\r\nenough;--it will then shed water; but when rolled up, water will run\r\ndown through. Let it stand till thoroughly dried, and then draw into the\r\nbarn; it will be bright and sweet. Another method is to cut when free\r\nfrom dew or rain, spread even, and allow it to wilt, and the leaves and\r\nsmaller parts to dry; then draw into the barn, putting alternate loads\r\nof clover and dry straw into the mow, salting the clover very lightly.\r\nThe clover is sometimes put in when quite green, and salted sufficiently\r\nto preserve it. It is injurious to cattle, by compelling them to eat\r\nmore salt than they need. Cattle will eat but little salt in winter,\r\nwhen it stands within their reach; too much salt in hay compels them to\r\neat more, which engenders disease. Clover cured as above makes the best\r\npossible clover-hay, if great care be used to prevent excessive salting.\r\n\r\nSaving clover-seed is a matter of considerable importance. The large red\r\nclover is too late a variety to produce seed on a second crop the same\r\nseason, as do the medium and small. The first growth must be allowed to\r\nripen. Cut when the heads are generally dead, but before it has begun to\r\nshell. The medium and small red clovers will produce a good crop of seed\r\nfrom second growth, if it be not too dry, immediately after mowing. Cut\r\nwhen the heads generally are dry, rake into small winrows at once, and\r\nsoon put it in small bunches and let it stand until very dry, and then\r\ndraw in. Raking and stirring after it becomes dry will waste one half of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOFFEE BEAN.\r\n\r\nThis grows in a pod somewhat resembling the pea; easily raised, as other\r\nbeans; and is very productive. Browned and ground, it is used as a\r\nsubstitute for coffee. By many persons it is much esteemed. If this and\r\nthe orange carrot were adopted extensively, instead of coffee, it would\r\nafford a great relief to the health, as well as the pockets, of the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN.\r\n\r\nThis is the most valuable of all American products of the soil, not\r\nexcepting wheat or cotton. It is used for human food all over the world.\r\nAnd there is no domestic animal or fowl, whose habits require grain,\r\nwhether whole or ground, that is not fond of it. It is easily raised,\r\nand is a sure and abundant crop, in all latitudes south of forty-six\r\ndegrees north. The varieties are few, and principally local. The soil\r\ncan not be made too rich for corn. It should be planted in rows each\r\nway, to allow cultivating both ways with a horse. The distance of rows\r\napart has been a subject of some differences of opinion; there is a\r\ndisposition to crowd it too near together. In western New York, where\r\nmuch attention has been given to it, the usual distance is three and one\r\nhalf feet each way; others plant four feet apart. On all land we have\r\never seen, we believe four feet apart each way, with four or five stalks\r\nin a hill, will produce the largest yield. It lets in the sun\r\nsufficiently around every hill, and the proportion of ears to the stalks\r\nwill be larger than in any other distance. Planting with a span of\r\nhorses, and a planter on which a man can ride and plant two rows at\r\nonce, is the easiest and most expeditious. We can not too strongly\r\nrecommend harrowing corn as soon as it comes out of the ground. It\r\nincreases the crop, and saves much expense in cultivating. All planters\r\nshould know that Indian corn is one of those plants which will come to\r\nmaturity at a certain age, whether it be large or small; hence, anything\r\nthat will increase the growth while young will add to the product. Corn\r\nneglected when small receives, thereby, an injury from which it will\r\nnever recover; after-hoeing may help it, but never can fully restore it.\r\nIf there are small weeds, the harrowing will destroy them, and give all\r\nthe strength of the soil to the young corn; if there are no weeds, the\r\neffect of the harrowing will be to give the young plants twice as large\r\na growth in the first two weeks as they would make without it. Harrow\r\nwith a =V= drag, with the front tooth out, that the remaining\r\nteeth may go each side of the row. Use two horses, allowing the row to\r\nstand between them; let the harrow-teeth run as near the corn as\r\npossible. Never plant corn until the soil has become warm enough to make\r\nit come up quickly and grow rapidly. If you feed corn to cattle whole,\r\nfeed it with the husks on, as it will compel them to chew it better,\r\nand will thus be a great saving. Crib corn only when very dry, and avoid\r\nthe Western and Southern method of leaving cribs uncovered; the corn\r\nthus becomes less valuable for any use. A little plaster or wood-ashes\r\napplied to corn on first coming up, and again when six inches high, will\r\nabundantly repay cost and labor;--it will pay even on the prairie-lands\r\nof the West, and is quite essential on the poorer soils of the East and\r\nNorth. It had better never be neglected. The crop will weigh more to the\r\nacre, by allowing it to stand as it grew, until thoroughly dry. The next\r\nlarger crop is when the stalks are cut off above the ear (called\r\ntopping) after it has become glazed. Still a little less will be the\r\nproduct when it is cut up at the ground, while the leaves are yet quite\r\ngreen. The two latter methods are adapted for the purpose of saving\r\nfodder in good condition for cattle. Intelligent farmers regard the\r\nfodder of much more value than the decrease in the weight of the grain.\r\nCorn thus cut up, and fed without husking, is the best possible way for\r\nwinter-fattening cattle on a large scale, and where corn is abundant. To\r\nsave the whole, swine should follow the cattle, changing yards once a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nSeed-corn should be gathered from the first ripe large ears before\r\nfrost, and while the general crop is yet green. Select ears above the\r\naverage size, that are well filled out to the end, and your corn will\r\nimprove from year to year. Take your seed indiscriminately from the crib\r\nat planting-time, and your corn will deteriorate. The largest and best\r\nears ripen neither first nor last; hence, select the largest ears before\r\nall is ripe, and reject the small earliest ears. Soaking seed\r\ntwenty-four hours, and then rolling in plaster before planting, is\r\nrecommended; it is conveniently practised only where you plant by hand.\r\nSoaking without rolling in plaster is good, if you plant in a wet time;\r\nbut if in a dry time, it is absolutely injurious. Once in a while there\r\noccurs quite a general failure of seed-corn to come up. Farmers say that\r\ntheir corn looks as fair as ever, but does not vegetate well. When this\r\nis general, there is a remedy that every farmer can successfully apply.\r\nThe difficulty is not (as we have often heard asserted) from the intense\r\ncold of the winter: it is sometimes the result of cold, wet weather\r\nafter planting. But we do not believe that such would be the effect,\r\nwith good seed, on properly-prepared land. The difficulty is, the fall\r\nwas very wet, and the seed was allowed to stand out and get thoroughly\r\nsoaked; when it was gathered it was damp, and the intense cold of winter\r\ndestroyed its vitality, without injuring its appearance. There is no\r\ndegree of cold, in a latitude where corn will grow, that will injure the\r\nseed, if it be gathered dry and kept so. Our rules for saving seed,\r\ngiven above, will always remedy this evil. This is, perhaps, the most\r\nprofitable of all green crops for soiling cattle. Sown on clean, mellow\r\nland, it will produce an enormous weight of good green fodder, suitable\r\nfor summer and early fall feeding of cows, just at a time when dry\r\nweather has nearly destroyed their pastures. Corn-fodder, well cured, is\r\nbetter for milch-cows than the best of hay. Cut fine and mixed with\r\nground feed, it is excellent for cattle and horses. It is best preserved\r\nin small stacks or large shocks, that will perfectly dry through. The\r\ntops and leaves, removed while green, are very fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTON.\r\n\r\nNo product of the soil is more useful than this. To this country alone\r\nwe give the highest value to Indian corn. But, in usefulness to the\r\nwhole world, corn must yield the palm to cotton. It employs more hands\r\nand capital in manufacturing, and enters more largely into the clothing\r\nof mankind, than any other article. The history of cotton and the\r\ncotton-gin, and of the manufacture of cotton goods, is exceedingly\r\ninteresting. The eminence of Great Britain as the first commercial\r\nnation of the world is due, in no small degree, to her cotton\r\nmanufactures. And the influence of this great staple American product\r\nupon all the interests of this country, social and political, civil and\r\nreligious, is universally felt and acknowledged. The cotton-fields of\r\nthe South, at certain stages of growth, and especially when in bloom,\r\npresent scenes of beauty unsurpassed by any other growing crop. It does\r\nnot come within our design in this work to give a very extended view of\r\ncotton culture. This business in the United States is confined\r\nprincipally to a particular class of men, known as planters. They\r\ncultivate it on a large scale, having the control of large means. Such\r\nmen seek knowledge of those of their own class, and would hardly\r\ncondescend to listen to an essay on their peculiar business, written by\r\na Northern man, not experienced in planting. And yet an article, not\r\ncovering more than ten pages of this volume, might be written,\r\ncondensing in a clear manner all that is established in this branch of\r\nAmerican industry, as found in the publications of the South. Such an\r\narticle, well written, by a man who would be regarded good authority,\r\nwould be of vast pecuniary value to the South. Whoever carefully reads\r\nSouthern agricultural papers, and \"TURNER'S COTTON-PLANTER'S MANUAL,\"\r\nwill see a great conflict of opinions on the subject, and yet a\r\npresentation of many facts, that one thoroughly conversant with soil\r\nculture in general would see to be true and important. The embodiment of\r\nthese facts and principles in a brief, plain article that would be\r\nreceived and practised, would add value to the annual cotton crop, that\r\nwould be counted by millions. What better service can some Southern\r\ngentleman do for his own chosen and favorite region than to write such\r\nan article? We give the following brief view of the whole subject, not\r\npresuming to teach cotton-planters what they are supposed to understand\r\nmuch better than we do, but to throw out some thoughts that may be\r\nsuggestive of improvements that others may mature and carry out, and to\r\nlead young men, just commencing the business of planting, to look about\r\nand see if they may not make some improvements upon what they behold\r\naround them. This will not fail of being interesting to Northern men,\r\nmost of whom know nothing of the cotton-plant, or the modes of its\r\ncultivation. It is interesting, too, that some of the most essential\r\npoints are in perfect accordance with the great principles of soil\r\nculture throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThere are three species of cotton: tree-cotton, shrub-cotton, and\r\nherbaceous cotton. The tree-cotton is cultivated to considerable extent\r\nin northern Africa, and produces a fair staple of cotton for commerce;\r\nbeing produced on trees from ten to twenty-five feet high, it is not so\r\neasily gathered. The shrub-cotton is cultivated in various parts of the\r\nworld, particularly in Asia and South America. Growing in the form of\r\nsmall bushes, it is convenient, and the staple is fair. But these are\r\nboth inferior to the herbaceous cotton. This is an herb growing\r\nannually, like corn, a number of feet in height, more or less according\r\nto soil and season, and producing the best known cotton. Under these\r\nspecies there are many varieties: we need speak only of the varieties of\r\nherbaceous cotton. Writers vary in their estimates of varieties; some\r\nsay there are eight, and others put them as high as one hundred. This is\r\na question of no practical moment. The sea-island cotton, called also\r\n\"long staple\" on account of its very long silky fibres, is the finest\r\ncotton known. Its name arose from the fact of its production in greatest\r\nperfection on the low, sandy islands near the coasts of some of the\r\nSouthern states. It does well on low land near the seashore. The\r\nsaltness and humidity of such locations seem peculiarly favorable to its\r\ngreatest perfection. It yields about half as much as the \"short staple\"\r\ncalled Mexican and Petit gulf cotton, and known in commerce as upland\r\ncotton. But the sea-island, or long staple, sells for three or four\r\ntimes as much per pound, and, hence, is most profitable to the planter,\r\nin all regions where it will flourish well. The Mexican is very\r\nproductive on most soils, and is easily gathered and prepared for\r\nmarket. There are quite a number of other varieties; as, banana, Vick's\r\nhundred-seed, Pitt's prolific, multibolus, mammoth, sugar-loaf, &c., &c.\r\nThe sugar-loaf is highly commended, as are some of the others named.\r\nThey have had quite a run among seed-sellers. Most of these varieties\r\nare the improved Mexican. It is well to get seed frequently from a\r\ndistance; but any extravagant prices are unwise. Improvement of\r\ncotton-seed is an important part of its most profitable culture. While\r\nmuch said about it by interested parties is doubtless mere humbug, yet\r\nthere is great importance to be attached to improvement of seed. This is\r\ntrue of all agricultural products, and no less so of cotton than of\r\nothers. Two things only are essential to constant improvement in\r\ncotton-seed--_selection_ and _care_. Select from the best quality,\r\nproducing the largest yield, and maturing early; pick it before much\r\nrain has fallen on it after ripening; dry it thoroughly before ginning,\r\nand dry it very thoroughly after it is clear of the fibre, before\r\nputting it in bulk. Cotton-seed, without extra care in drying, has\r\nmoisture enough to make it heat in bulk, by which its germinating power\r\nis greatly impaired. It is this, and the effects of fall rains, that\r\ncauses seed to trouble planters so seriously by not coming up: this\r\nmakes it difficult to obtain good even stands, and causes much loss by\r\ndiminished crops. Care in these respects would add many pounds to the\r\nacre in most cotton-fields of the land.\r\n\r\n_Preparing the Soil for Planting._--On all land not having a porous\r\nsubsoil, plow very deep; it gives opportunity for the long tap-root of\r\nthe plant to penetrate deep, and guard against excessive drought. The\r\nusual custom is to lay the ground into beds, elevated a little in the\r\nmiddle, and a depression between them, in which excessive moisture may\r\nrun off; also to increase the action of the sun and air. The surface of\r\nthe soil to be planted should be made very fine and smooth. This is true\r\nof everything planted--it should be in finely-pulverized soil; it comes\r\nup more readily and evenly. Soil left in coarse lumps or particles gives\r\nthe air too much action on the germinating seeds and young plants, and\r\nretards and stints their growth. Deep plowing guards alike against too\r\nmuch or too little moisture. Too much water has room to sink away from\r\nthe surface and allow it to dry speedily. It also forms a sort of\r\nreservoir to hold water for use in a drought. The seed should be planted\r\nin as straight a line as possible, from three and a half to five and a\r\nhalf feet apart one way, and from fourteen to twenty-five inches the\r\nother, according to the quality of the land, and the growth of the\r\nvariety planted. Rich lands will not bear the plants so close as the\r\npoor. Many are great losers by not securing plants enough on the ground.\r\nStraight lines greatly facilitate culture, as it can mostly be done with\r\nthe plow or cultivator. Turning land over deep, just before planting, is\r\nthe best known remedy for the cut-worm; it is said to put them back\r\nuntil the plants grow beyond their reach. The best planters generally\r\ncover with a piece of plank drawn over the furrow in which the seed is\r\ndropped. It would be far better to roll it, as some few planters do; the\r\neffect on the early vegetation of the seed and rapid growth of the young\r\nplant would be very great, on the general principles given on \"Rolling.\"\r\nThe object of cultivation is to keep down the grass, which is the great\r\nenemy of the cotton. Plowing the last thing before planting aids this,\r\nby giving the cotton quite as early a start as the weeds or grass.\r\nCultivate early, and the grass will be easily covered and killed. Always\r\nplant when it will come up speedily and grow rapidly; this is better\r\nthan very early planting, and certainly much better than very late. Thin\r\nout to one in a place, as early as the plants are out of danger of\r\ndying. Gathering should commence as soon as bolls enough are in right\r\ncondition to allow a hand to gather forty pounds per day. It is better\r\nand cheaper than to risk the injury from rains after the crop is ripe.\r\n\r\nMANURES.--Perhaps this is, at the present time, the greatest question\r\nfor cotton-planters. The application of all the most approved principles\r\nand agents of fertilization would do more for the interests of the\r\ncotton crop than anything else. Cotton-plantations are sometimes said to\r\nrun down so as to render it necessary to abandon portions of the land,\r\nand select new. Instead of this, land may not only be kept up with\r\nproper manuring, but made to yield larger crops from year to year. The\r\nfollowing analysis of the ash of the cotton-plant will indicate the\r\nwants of the soil in which it grows:--\r\n\r\n  1. Potash                29.58\r\n  2. Lime                  24.34\r\n  3. Magnesia               3.73\r\n  4. Chloride               0.65\r\n  5. Phosphoric acid       34.92\r\n  6. Sulphuric acid         3.54\r\n  7. Silica                 3.24\r\n                           ----\r\n                           100.00\r\n\r\nThis analysis shows that the soil for cotton needs much lime, bones or\r\nbone-dust, and wood-ashes, besides the ordinary barn-yard and compost\r\nmanures. All the preparations and applications of manures specified in\r\nthis work, under the head of \"Manures,\" are applicable to cotton. The\r\nusual recommendations of rotation in crops is, perhaps, more important\r\nin cotton culture than anywhere else. Judicious fallowing, on principles\r\nadapted to a Southern climate, is another great means of keeping up and\r\nimproving the land. This is also the only effectual means of guarding\r\nagainst the numerous enemies and diseases of the cotton-plant. The\r\nhealth of the plants is secured, and they are made to outstrip their\r\nenemies only by the fertility and fine tilth of the soil in which they\r\ngrow. This is confirmed on every hand by the correspondence of the most\r\nintelligent planters of the South. Let cotton-growers go into a thorough\r\nsystem of fertilization of their soils, and attend personally to the\r\nimprovement of their cotton-seed, by selection, as recommended above,\r\nand the result will be an addition of one eighth, or one fourth, to the\r\nproducts of cotton in the United States, without adding another acre to\r\nthe area under cultivation. When this comes to be understood, men of\r\nsmall means will cultivate a little cotton by their own individual\r\nlabor, as the poorer men do corn and other agricultural products, and\r\nthus improve their condition. The above suggestions are the conclusions\r\nto which we come, from a thorough examination of what has been published\r\nto the world on this subject. We recommend the careful perusal of \"The\r\nCotton-Planter's Manual,\" by Turner (published by Saxton and Co., New\r\nYork), and increased attention to the subject, by the intelligent,\r\neducated, and practical men with whom the cotton-growing regions abound.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOWS.\r\n\r\nThe cow occupies the first place among domestic animals, in value to the\r\nAmerican people, not excepting even the horse. From the original stock,\r\nstill kept as a curiosity on the grounds of some English noblemen,\r\ncattle have been greatly improved by care in breeding and feeding. Those\r\nwild animals are still beautiful, but only about one third of the weight\r\nof the ordinary improved cattle, and not more than one fourth that of\r\nthe _most improved_. Improving the breed of cattle is a subject by\r\nitself, demanding a separate treatise. It is not to be expected that we\r\nshould go into it at length in a work like this. But so much depends\r\nupon the cow, that we can hardly write an article on her without giving\r\nthose general principles that lie at the foundation of all improvement\r\nin cattle. The few suggestions that follow, if heeded, would be worth\r\nmany times the value of this book to any farmer not already familiar\r\nwith the facts. The cow affects all other stock in two ways; first, the\r\nform of calves, and consequently of grown cattle, is affected as much by\r\nthe cow as by the bull. The quality and quantity of her milk, also, has\r\na great influence upon the early growth of all neat stock. Cattle are\r\nusually named from their horns, as \"short horns,\" &c. It is a means of\r\ndistinction, like a name, but not expressive of quality. The leading\r\nmarks of a good cow are, medium height for her weight, small neck,\r\nstraight and wide back, wide breast--giving room for healthy action of\r\nthe lungs--heavy hind-quarters, and soft skin with fine hair, skin\r\nyellowish, with much dandruff above the bag behind. A smart countenance\r\nis also expressive of good qualities; there is as much difference in the\r\neyes and expression of cattle as of men. Select only such cows to raise\r\nstock from, and allow them to go to no bull that has not good marks, and\r\nis not of a superior form. Another important matter is to avoid\r\nbreeding in and in. This is injurious in all domestic animals and\r\nfowls. Always have the cow and the bull from different regions:\r\nattention to this would constantly improve any breed we have, and by\r\nimproving the size of cattle, and milking qualities of cows, would add\r\nvast amounts to the wealth of farmers, without the necessity of\r\npurchasing, at a great price, any of the high-bred cattle. We have\r\nobserved, in our article on calves, that abundant feeding during the\r\nfirst year has much to do with the excellence of stock. Unite with these\r\nregularity in feeding, watering, and salting, keeping dry and warm in\r\nstormy, cold weather, and well curried and clean, and a farmer's stock\r\nwill be much more profitable to him. But this brief mention of the\r\ngeneral principles must suffice, while we give all the further space we\r\ncan occupy with this article to--\r\n\r\nTHE INFALLIBLE MARKS OF THE MILKING QUALITIES OF COWS.--M. Francis\r\nGuenon, of France, has published a treatise, in which he shows, by\r\nexternal marks alone, the quality and quantity of milk of any cow, and\r\nthe length of time she will continue to give milk. These marks are so\r\nplain, that they are applicable to calves but a few weeks old, as well\r\nas to cows. Whoever will take a little pains to understand this, can\r\nknow, when he proposes to buy a cow, how much milk she will give, with\r\nproper feed and treatment, the quality of her milk, and the length of\r\ntime she will give milk after having been gotten with calf. If the\r\nfarmer has heifer-calves, some of which he proposes to send to the\r\nbutcher and others to raise, he may know which will make poor milkers,\r\nand which good ones, and raise the good and kill the poor. Thus, he may\r\nsee a calf that his neighbor is going to slaughter, and, from these\r\nexternal marks, he may discover that it would make one of the best\r\nmilking cows of the neighborhood; it would then pay to buy and raise it,\r\nthough he might have to kill and throw away his own, which he could see\r\nwould make a poor cow if raised. Thus, all extraordinary milkers would\r\nbe raised, and all poor ones be slaughtered: this alone would improve\r\nthe whole stock of the country twenty-five per cent. in as many years.\r\nAttention has been called to this, in the most emphatic manner, by _The\r\nNew York Tribune_--a paper that always takes a deep interest in whatever\r\nwill advance the great industrial interests of the whole people--and\r\nyet, this announcement will be new to a vast number of farmers into\r\nwhose hands this volume will fall. To many it will be utterly\r\nincredible, especially when we inform them that the indications are,\r\nmainly, the growth of the hair, on the cow behind, from the roots of the\r\nteats upward. \"Impossible!\" many a practical, common-sense man will say.\r\nBut that same man will acknowledge that a bull has a different color,\r\ndifferent neck, and different horns, left in his natural state, from\r\nthose he would exhibit if altered to an ox. Why is it not equally\r\ncredible that the growth of the hair, &c., should be affected by the\r\nsecretion and flow of the milk on that part of the system where those\r\noperations are principally carried on? But, aside from all reasonings on\r\nthe subject, the fact is certain, and whoever may read this article may\r\ntest its correctness, as applied to his own cows or those of his\r\nneighbor. The great agriculturists of France (and it is no mean\r\nagricultural country) have tested it, under the direction of the\r\nagricultural societies, and pronounced it entirely certain. This was\r\nfollowed by an award, by the French government, of a pension of three\r\nthousand francs per annum to Guenon, as a benefactor of the people by\r\nthe discovery he had made. The same has been amply tested in this\r\ncountry, with the same certain results. It now only remains for every\r\nfarmer to test it for himself, and avail himself of the profits that\r\nwill arise from it. Guenon divides cows into eight classes, and has\r\neight orders under each class, making sixty-four cows, of which he has\r\ncuts in his work. He also adds what he calls a bastard-cow in each\r\nclass, making seventy-two in all. Now, to master all these nice\r\ndistinctions in his classes and orders would be tedious, and nearly\r\nuseless. Efforts at this would tend to confusion. We desire to give the\r\nindications in a brief manner, with a very few cuts; and yet, we would\r\nhope to be much better understood by the masses than we believe Guenon\r\nto be. We claim no credit; Guenon is the discoverer, and we only\r\npromulgate his discovery in the plainest language we can command; and if\r\nwe can reach the ear of the American farmers, and call their attention\r\nto this, we shall not have labored in vain.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the hind-part of the cow, from a point near the\r\ngambrel-joint up to the tail, Guenon calls the escutcheon. The following\r\ncuts show the marks of all of Guenon's eight classes, the first and the\r\nlast in each class. The intermediate ones are in regular gradation from\r\nthe first to the eighth order. Each class is divided into high, medium,\r\nand low, yielding milk somewhat in proportion to their size. We give the\r\nquantity of milk which the large cows will yield. This also supposes\r\ncows to be well fed on suitable food. Smaller cows of the same class and\r\norder, or those that are poorly cared for and fed, will, of course, give\r\nless.\r\n\r\nThe names of all these eight classes are entirely arbitrary--they mean\r\nnothing. M. Guenon adopted them on account of the shape of the\r\nescutcheon, or from the name of the place from which the cows came. But\r\ncows with these peculiar marks are found among all breeds, in all\r\ncountries, and of all colors, sizes, and ages. These marks are certain,\r\nexcept the variations that are caused by extra care or neglect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. FIRST CLASS. Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n_Order_ 1. FLANDERS COW. _Order_ 8.]\r\n\r\nThis class of cows has a delicate bag, covered with fine downy hair,\r\ngrowing upward from between the teats, and, above the bag behind, it\r\nblends itself with a growth of hair pointing upward, and covering the\r\nregion marked in figure 1. This upward growth of hair begins on the legs\r\njust above the gambrel-joint, covers the inside of the thighs, and\r\nextends up to the tail, as in figure first. Above the hind teats they\r\ngenerally have two oval spots, two inches wide by three long, formed by\r\nhair growing downward, and of paler color than the hair that surrounds\r\nthem (E, E, in fig. 1). The skin covered by the whole of this escutcheon\r\nis yellowish, with a few black spots, and a kind of bran, or dandruff,\r\ndetaches from it. Cows of this class and order, when well kept, give\r\nabout twenty-two quarts of milk per day, when in full flow, and before\r\ngetting with calf again; after this a little less, but still a large\r\nquantity. They will continue to give milk till eight months gone with\r\ncalf, or till they calve again, if you continue to milk them. This,\r\nhowever, should never be done; it exposes the health of cows at the time\r\nof calving, and injures the young. From this there is a gradual\r\ndiminution in the quantity of milk through the orders, down to the\r\neighth.\r\n\r\nCows of this order (fig. 2), or with the marks you see in the drawing,\r\nwill never yield more than about five quarts per day in their best\r\nstate, and they will only continue to give milk until two months with\r\ncalf: hence, these are only fit for the butcher. The intervening six in\r\nGruenon's classification are gradually poorer than the first, and better\r\nthan the last, in our cuts. The marks are but very slightly different\r\nfrom the above, except in size; the difference is so trifling, that any\r\none can at once see that they belong to this class;--and the comparative\r\nsize of this mark will show, infallibly, their value compared with the\r\nabove. In the intermediate grades, the spots (E, E, fig. 1) are smaller,\r\nand as the orders descend, these spots are wanting, and some slight\r\nchanges in the form of the whole mark are observed, yet the general\r\noutline remains the same. Now, as the decrease in the eight orders in\r\neach class is about from two and a half to three or three and a half\r\nquarts, no man with eyes need be deceived in buying a cow, or raising a\r\ncalf, in the quantity of milk she may be made to give. Any man can tell,\r\nwithin one or two quarts, the yield of any cow or heifer. The only\r\nchance for mistake is in the case of bastard-cows, which rapidly dry up\r\non getting with calf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. SECOND CLASS. Fig. 4.\r\n\r\n_Order_ 1. SELVAGE COW. _Order_ 8.]\r\n\r\nIn this class, the shape of the escutcheon is entirely distinct, so that\r\nno one will confound it with the first. The gradations are the same as\r\nin the preceding, only this class, all through, is inferior to the\r\nother. The first (fig. 3) will give only twenty or twenty-one quarts,\r\nand the poorest only four quarts. This escutcheon is formed by ascending\r\nhair, but with a very different outline from the first class; it has the\r\nsame spots above the hind teats as the first, formed by descending\r\nhair. In the lower orders these disappear--first one, then one small\r\none, and then none at all--and as they descend, similar spots appear,\r\nformed in the same way, on one or both sides of the vulva (F, fig. 3).\r\nThe skin of the inside surface of the thigh is yellowish. The time of\r\ngiving milk--viz., eight months gone with calf, or as long as you\r\ncontinue to milk them--is the same as in the first class. The last order\r\n(fig. 4) of this class give very little milk after getting with calf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. THIRD CLASS. Fig. 6.\r\n\r\n_Order_ 1. CURVELINE COW. _Order_ 8.]\r\n\r\nThis escutcheon is easily distinguished from the others, by its outline\r\nfigure. The spots on the bag above the hind teats are formed as in the\r\npreceding, and as gradually disappear in the lower orders. In those\r\norders there is a slight difference in the outline, but its general form\r\nis the same. The first of this class (fig. 5) yields twenty or\r\ntwenty-one quarts a day, and gives milk till within a month of calving.\r\nThe last order of the class (fig. 6) gives only three and a half quarts,\r\nand goes dry on getting with calf. The intermediate gradations between\r\nthe first and eighth orders are the same as in the preceding classes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. FOURTH CLASS. Fig. 8.\r\n\r\n_Order_ 1. BICORN COW. _Order_ 8.]\r\n\r\nThese escutcheons are unmistakably diverse from either of the others;\r\ngradations, from first to eighth orders, the same. The first order in\r\nthis class (fig. 7) will give eighteen quarts a day, and give milk until\r\neight months with calf. The dandruff which detaches from the skin within\r\nthe escutcheon of the first order is yellowish or copperish color. The\r\ntwo marks on the sides of the vulva are narrow streaks of ascending\r\nhair, not in the general mark. The last order of the class (fig. 8)\r\ngives three and a half quarts only a day, and goes dry when with calf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. FIFTH CLASS. Fig. 10.\r\n\r\n_Order_ 1. DEMIJOHN COW. _Order_ 8.]\r\n\r\nHere is another general mark, easily distinguishable from all the others\r\nby its outline. The first order (fig. 9) will give eighteen quarts a\r\nday, and give milk eight months, or within a month of calving. Yellowish\r\nskin; delicate bag, covered with fine downy hair, as in the higher\r\norders of all the preceding classes. The eighth order of this class\r\n(fig. 10) will give only two and a half quarts per day, and none after\r\nconceiving anew. The gradation from first to eighth order is regular, as\r\nin the others.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH CLASS.\r\n\r\nYield of first order (fig. 11) eighteen quarts per day; time, eight\r\nmonths. Skin within the escutcheon same color, bag equally delicate, and\r\nhair fine, as in all the first orders. Eighth order (fig. 12) yields\r\nabout two quarts per day, and dries up on getting with calf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Fig. 12.\r\n\r\n_Order_ 1. SQUARE ESCUTCHEON COW. _Order_ 8.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. SEVENTH CLASS. Fig. 14.\r\n\r\n_Order_ 1. LIMOUSINE COW. _Order_ 8.]\r\n\r\nFirst order in this class (fig. 13) gives fifteen quarts; time, eight\r\nmonths. The skin, bag, and hair, same as in the higher orders in all the\r\nclasses. The eighth order (fig. 14) will yield two and a half quarts per\r\nday, and dry up when with calf.\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTH CLASS.\r\n\r\nFirst order (fig. 15) will give fifteen quarts per day; time, eight\r\nmonths. Skin in escutcheon reddish-yellow and silky, hair fine, teats\r\nfar apart. The eighth order (fig. 16) yields two and a half quarts a\r\nday, and dries up on getting with calf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. Fig. 16.\r\n\r\n_Order_ 1. HORIZONTAL CUT COW. _Order_ 8.]\r\n\r\nEach class of cows has a kind called bastards, among those whose\r\nescutcheons would otherwise indicate the first order of their class:\r\nthese often deceive the most practised eye. The only remedy is to become\r\nfamiliar with the infallible marks given by Guenon by which bastards may\r\nbe known. This defect will account for the irregularity of many cows,\r\nand their suddenly going dry on becoming with calf, and often for the\r\nbad quality of their milk. They are distinguished by the lines of\r\nascending and descending hair in their escutcheon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. Fig. 18. Fig. 19.]\r\n\r\nIn the FLANDERS COW (fig. 17) there are two bastards; one distinguished\r\nby the fact that the hair forming the line of the escutcheon bristles\r\nup, like beards on a head of grain, instead of lying smooth, as in the\r\ngenuine cow; they project over the intersection of the ascending and\r\ndescending hair in a very bristling manner. The other bastard of the\r\nFLANDERS COW is known by having an oval patch of downward growing hair,\r\nabout eight inches below the vulva, and in a line with it; in the large\r\ncows it is four inches long, and two and a half wide, and the hair\r\nwithin it always of a lighter color than that surrounding it. Cows of\r\nthis mark are always imperfect. In the bastards, the skin on the\r\nescutcheon is usually reddish; it is smooth to the touch, and yields no\r\ndandruff.\r\n\r\nBastards of the SELVAGE COW are known by two oval patches of ascending\r\nhair, one on each side of the vulva, four or five inches long, by an\r\ninch and a half wide (fig. 18). The larger the spot, and the coarser the\r\nhair, the more defective they prove, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nBastards of the CURVELINE COW are known by the size of spots of hair on\r\neach side of the vulva (fig. 18). When they are of four or five inches\r\nby one and a half, and pointed or rounded at the ends, they indicate\r\nbastards. If they be small, the cow will not lose her milk very rapidly\r\non getting with calf.\r\n\r\nBastards of the BICORN COW are indicated precisely as in the\r\npreceding--by _the size_ of the spots of ascending hair, above the\r\nescutcheon and by the sides of the vulva (F, F, fig. 18).\r\n\r\nBastards of the DEMIJOHN COW are distinguished precisely as the two\r\npreceding--_size of the streaks_ (fig. 18).\r\n\r\nThe SQUARE ESCUTCHEON COW indicates bastards, by a streak of hair at the\r\nright of the vulva (fig. 19). When that ascending hair is coarse and\r\nbristly, it is a sure evidence that the animal is a bastard.\r\n\r\nLIMOUSINE COWS show their bastards precisely as do the CURVELINE and\r\nBICORN, by the size of the ascending streaks of hair, on the right and\r\nleft of the vulva. (Fig. 19.)\r\n\r\nBastards of the HORIZONTAL CUT COWS have no escutcheon whatever. By this\r\nthey are always known.\r\n\r\nSome bastards are good milkers until they get with calf, and then very\r\nsoon dry up. Others are poor milkers. Those with coarse hair and but\r\nlittle of it, in the escutcheon, give poor, watery milk. Those of fine,\r\nthick hair will give good milk.\r\n\r\nBULLS have escutcheons of the same shape as the cows, but on a smaller\r\nscale. Whenever there are streaks of descending hair bristling up among\r\nthe ascending hair of the escutcheon, rendering it quite irregular and\r\nrough in its appearance, the animal is regarded as a bastard. Never put\r\na cow to any bull that has not a regular, well-defined, and smooth\r\nescutcheon. This is as fully as we have room to go into M. Guenon's\r\ndetails. We fear this will fall into the hands of many who will not take\r\nthe pains to master even these distinctions. To those who will, we trust\r\nthey will be found plain, and certain in their results. From all this,\r\none thing is certain, and that is of immense value to the farmer: it is,\r\nthat on general principles, without remembering the exact figure of one\r\nof the indications above given, or one of the arbitrary terms it has\r\nbeen necessary to use, any man can tell the quality and quantity of milk\r\na cow will give, and the time she will give milk, with sufficient\r\naccuracy to buy no cow and raise no heifer that will not be a\r\nprofitable dairy cow, if that is what he desires. The rules by which\r\nthese things may be known are the following:\r\n\r\nNo cow, of any class, is ever a good milker, that has not a large\r\nsurface of hair growing upward from the teats and covering the inner\r\nsurface of the thighs, and extending up toward or to the tail.\r\n\r\nNo cow that is destitute of this mark, or only has a very small one, is\r\never a good milker. Every cow having a scanty growth of coarse hair in\r\nthe above mark will only give poor, watery milk; and every cow having a\r\nthick growth of fine hair on the escutcheon, or surface where it\r\nascends, and considerable dandruff, will always give good rich milk, and\r\nbe good for butter and cheese.\r\n\r\nEvery cow on which this mark is small will give but little milk, and dry\r\nup soon after getting with calf, and is not fit to be kept.\r\n\r\nObserve these brief rules, and milk your cows _at certain hours every\r\nday_--milk _very quickly_, without stopping, and _very clean_, not\r\nleaving a drop--and you never will have a poor cow on your farm, and at\r\nleast twenty-five per cent. will be added to the value of the ordinary\r\ndairy, that is made up of cows purchased or raised in the usual,\r\nhap-hazard way.\r\n\r\nIf your cows' udders swell after calving, wash them in aconite made weak\r\nwith water; it is very good for taking out inflammation. Other common\r\nremedies are known. If your cow or other creature gets choked, pour into\r\nthe throat half a pint, at least, of oil; and by rubbing the neck, the\r\nobstruction will probably move up or down. Curry your cows as thoroughly\r\nas you do your horses; and if they ever chance to get lousy, wash them\r\nin a decoction of tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRANBERRY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis is native in the northern parts of both hemispheres. In England and\r\non the continents of Europe and Asia, native cranberries are inferior,\r\nin size and quality, to the American. Our own have also been greatly\r\nimproved by cultivation. They have become an important article of\r\ncommerce, and find a ready sale, at high prices, in all the leading\r\nmarkets of the country. Their successful cultivation, therefore,\r\ndeserves attention, as really as that of other fruits. Mr. B. Eastwood\r\nhas written a volume on the subject, which probably contains all the\r\nfacts already established, together with many opinions of scientific and\r\npractical cultivators. The work is valuable, but much less so than it\r\nwould have been, had the author put into a few pages the important\r\nfacts, and left out all speculations and diversities of opinion. The\r\nobjection to most of this kind of literature is the intermixture of\r\nfacts and valuable suggestions with so much that is not only useless,\r\nbut absolutely pernicious, by the confusion it creates. We think the\r\nfollowing directions for the cultivation of the cranberry are complete,\r\naccording to our present knowledge:--\r\n\r\n_Soil._--It is universally agreed that _beach sand_ is the best. Not\r\nfrom the beach of the ocean barely, but of lakes, ponds, or rivers.\r\nThere is no evidence that any saline quality that may be in sand from\r\nthe beach of the sea, is particularly useful. It is the cleanness of the\r\nsand, on which account it is less calculated to promote a growth of\r\nweeds, and allows a free passage of moisture toward the surface. Hence\r\nwhite sand is preferable, and the cleaner the better. Whoever has a\r\nmoist meadow in the soil of which there is considerable sand has a good\r\nplace for a cranberry bed. If you have not a sand meadow, select a plat\r\nof ground as moist as any you have, upon which water will not stand\r\nunless you confine it there, and draw on sand to the depth of four or\r\nsix inches, having first removed any grass or break-turf, that may be in\r\ndanger of coming up as weeds to choke the vines. If you make the ground\r\nmellow below and then put on the sand, you will have a bed that will\r\ngive you but little further trouble. Peat soils will do, if you take off\r\nthe top and expose to the weather, frosts and rains, one year before\r\nplanting. The first year, peat will dry and crack, so as to destroy\r\nyoung cranberry vines. But after one winter's frost, it becomes\r\npulverized and will not again bake. Hence it is next to sand for a\r\ncranberry bed.\r\n\r\n_Situation._--The shore of a body of water, or of a small pond is best,\r\nif it be not too much exposed to violent action of wind and waves. Land\r\nthat retains much moisture within a foot of the surface, but which does\r\nnot become stagnant, is very valuable. The bottoms of small ponds that\r\ncan be drained off are very good. Any land that can be flowed with water\r\nat pleasure is good. By flooding, the blossoms are kept back till late\r\nspring frosts are gone. Any upland can be prepared as above. But if it\r\nbe a very dry soil it must have a liberal supply of water during dry\r\nweather, or success may not be expected.\r\n\r\n_Planting._--There are several methods. Sod planting consists in\r\npreparing the land and then cutting out square sods containing vines,\r\nand setting them at the distances apart, you desire. This was the\r\ngeneral method; but it is objectionable, on account of the weeds that\r\nwill grow out of the sod and choke the vines. This method is improved by\r\ntearing away the sod, leaving the roots naked, and then planting.\r\nAnother method is to cut off a vigorous shoot, and plant the middle of\r\nit, with each end protruding from the soil two or three inches apart.\r\nRoots will come out by all the leaves that are buried, and promote the\r\nspringing of many new vines, and thus the early matting of the bed which\r\nis very desirable.\r\n\r\nOthers take short slips and thrust four or five of them together down\r\ninto the soil as they do slips of currant bushes, thus making a hill of\r\nas many plants. And yet another method is, to cut up the vines into\r\npieces of two or three inches in length, and broad cast them on mellow\r\nsoil, and harrow them in as wheat--Others bury the short pieces in\r\ndrills. In either case they will soon mat the whole ground, if the land\r\nbe not weedy. The best plan for small beds is probably the middle\r\nplanting.\r\n\r\nDistances apart depend upon your design in cultivating. If your soil is\r\nsuch that so many weeds will grow as to require cultivating with a\r\nhorse, or much hoeing, four feet one way and two the other is the best.\r\nBetter have land so well covered with clean sand, that very few weeds\r\nwill grow and no cultivation be needed. Then set vines one foot apart\r\nand very soon the whole ground will be perfectly matted and will need\r\nvery little care for years. For two or three years pull out the weeds by\r\nhand, and the ground will be covered and need nothing more.\r\n\r\n_Varieties._--There are three principal ones of the lowland species. The\r\nbell, the bugle, and the cherry cranberries. These are named from their\r\nshape. Probably the cherry is the best, being the size, shape, and color\r\nof the cultivated red cherries. There has recently been discovered an\r\nupland variety, on the shores of Lake Superior, that bids fair to be as\r\nhardy and productive as the common currant. On all poor, hard, and even\r\nvery dry uplands, it does remarkably well. It grows extensively in the\r\nnorthern part of the British provinces. The fruit is smaller than the\r\nother varieties but is delicious, beautiful in color, and very abundant.\r\nIt will probably be one of our great and universal luxuries.\r\n\r\n_Healthy and Unhealthy Plants._--By this cultivators denote those that\r\nbear well and those that do not. And yet the unhealthy, or those that\r\nbear the least, are the larger, greener-leaved, and rapid-growing\r\nvarieties. It is difficult to describe them so that an unpractised eye\r\nwould know them from each other. The best way to be sure of getting the\r\nright kind is to purchase of a man you can trust, or visit the beds when\r\nthe fruit is in perfection and witness where the crop is abundant, mark\r\nit, and let it remain until you are ready to plant. This is always best\r\ndone in the spring, or from May 15th to June 15th.\r\n\r\n_Gathering_--is performed by hand, or with a cranberry-rake.\r\nHand-picking is best for the vines, but is more expensive. If a rake be\r\nused, it will draw out some small runners and retard the growth of young\r\nvines. But it is such a saving of expense, it had better be used, and\r\nalways drawn the same way. The fruit should be cleared of leaves and\r\ndecayed berries; and if intended for a near market, be packed dry in\r\nbarrels. If to be transported far, put them in small casks, say\r\nhalf-barrels, with good water. They may thus be carried around the globe\r\nin good condition. To keep well they should not be exposed to fall\r\nfrosts, and should not be picked before ripe. A little practice, and at\r\nfirst on a small scale, may enable American cultivators of the soil,\r\ngenerally, to have good cranberry beds. Much of the practical part of\r\nthis can only be learned by experience. The above suggestions will save\r\nmuch loss and discouragement.\r\n\r\n_Enemies_--are worms that attack the leaves, and another species that\r\nattack the berries. There are only two remedies proposed, viz., fire and\r\nwater. If you can flood your beds you will destroy them. If not, take a\r\ntime not very dry so as to endanger burning the roots, and burn over\r\nyour cranberry-beds, so as to consume all the vines. Next season new\r\nvines will grow up free from worms.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCUMBERS.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a number of varieties. But a few only deserve attention.\r\nThe best, for all uses, is the Early Cluster, a great bearer of firm,\r\ntender, brittle fruit. Early Frame, Long White, Turkey, and Long Green\r\nTurkey, are rather beautiful, but not prolific varieties. Long Prickly,\r\nis very good for pickles, and fills a cask rapidly, but is by no means\r\nso pleasant as the Early Cluster. The Short Prickly and White Spined are\r\nconsiderably used. The West India or small Gherkin is used only for\r\npickling, and is considered fine. But we regard all these inferior to\r\nthe Early Cluster.\r\n\r\n_Soil_ should be made very rich with compost and vegetable mould, with a\r\nliberal application of sand. All vines do better in a sandy soil. Plant\r\nin the open air only after the weather has become quite warm. An effort\r\nto get early cucumbers by early out-door planting is usually a failure;\r\nseeds decay, or having come up, after a long while, they grow slowly,\r\nand vines and fruit are apt to be imperfect. Six feet apart, each way,\r\nis the best distance; and after the plants get out of the way of\r\ninsects, and become well established, two vines in each hill is better\r\nthan more: the fruit will be better and more abundant, and they will\r\nbear much longer than when vines are left to grow very thick. They need\r\nwater in dry weather (see Watering). The first week in July is the best\r\ntime to plant for pickling. In a warm, dry climate, cucumbers do better\r\na little shaded, but not too much. Planted among young fruit-trees, or\r\nin alternate rows with corn, they do well. If allowed to run up bushes\r\nlike peas, they produce more and better fruit. Forcing for an early crop\r\nis often done, by digging a hole in the ground, two feet deep and two\r\nfeet square, and filling with hot manure, stamped down well, and covered\r\nwith six inches of fine mould. Put around a frame and cover with glass,\r\nat an angle of thirty-five degrees to the sun. Plant one hundred seeds\r\non the two feet square; when they come up, put two plants in a pot, set\r\nin a regular hotbed, and keep well watered and aired until the weather\r\nbe warm enough to transplant in the open air; then remove from the pots\r\nwithout breaking the ball of earth, and plant six feet apart. Four\r\nplants left in the original hill will bear earlier than those that have\r\nbeen removed. To get a large quantity of very early ones, plant a\r\ncorresponding number of hills, with the two feet of manure, as above;\r\nwhenever the weather becomes hot, they will need to be well watered, or\r\nthey will dry up. All cucumber-plants forced should have the main runner\r\ncut off, after the second rough leaf appears; this brings fruit earlier\r\nand twice as abundant. On transplanting cucumbers, or any other vines,\r\ncover them wholly from the sun for three days, or, if the weather be\r\ndry, for a whole week. We once thought melons and cucumbers very\r\ndifficult to transplant successfully; but we ascertained the only\r\ndifficulty to be, the want of sufficient water and shade. When roots and\r\nsoil were so dry that the dirt all fell off, we have transplanted with\r\nperfect success; but for a week the plants appeared to be ruined. We\r\nkept them covered and well watered, and they revived and made a great\r\ncrop, much earlier than seeds planted at the same time. Protection of\r\nplants from insects has been a subject of much study and many\r\nexperiments. Ashes and lime, and various decoctions and offensive\r\nmixtures, have been recommended. We discard them all, as both\r\ntroublesome and ineffectual. Our experience is, most decidedly, in favor\r\nof fencing each hill, of all vines, to keep off insects. A box a foot\r\nsquare and fifteen inches high, the lower edge set in the soil, will\r\nusually prove effectual. Put over a pane of glass, and it will be more\r\nsure, and increase the warmth and consequently the growth of the plants.\r\nPut millinet over the boxes, instead of glass, and not a hill will be\r\nlost. If a cutworm chances to be fenced in, he will show himself by\r\ncutting off a plant. Search him out and kill him, and all will be safe.\r\nSuch boxes, well taken care of, will last for ten years. This, then, is\r\na cheap as well as effectual method.\r\n\r\nCucumbers are a cooling, healthy article of diet, used in reasonable\r\nquantities. They should be sliced into cold water, taken out, and put in\r\nsharp vinegar with pepper and salt. Ripe cucumbers make one of the best\r\nof pickles: for directions in making, we refer to the cook-books. If you\r\nhave room near your back door for one large hill of cucumbers, you may\r\nobtain a remarkable growth. Dig down deep enough to set in an old\r\nbarrel, with head and bottom out, leaving the top even with the surface.\r\nFill with manure from the stable, well trod down. In fine rich mould,\r\naround on the outside of the barrel, plant twenty or thirty\r\ncucumber-seeds. Put a pail of water in the barrel every day. The water\r\ncomes up through the soil to the roots of the plants, bringing with it\r\nthe stimulus of the manure, and the effect is wonderful. A large barrel\r\nhas been filled with pickles from one such hill. If bushes be put up to\r\nsupport the vines, it is still better. Neglect to pour in water, and\r\nthey will dry up; but continue to water them, and they will bear till\r\nfrost in autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRANTS.\r\n\r\nThese are among the very best of all the small fruits; immensely\r\nproductive in all locations, and adapted to a great variety of uses, and\r\nhang long on the bushes after ripening.\r\n\r\nThere is quite a number of varieties, some of which are probably the\r\nmere result of cultivation of others well known. The common red is too\r\nwell known to need description--very acid, and always remarkably\r\nproductive, in all soils and situations. The size and quality of the\r\nfruit are affected by location and culture. The native currants, as\r\nfound in the north of Europe, are small and inferior; but all excellent\r\nmodern varieties have sprung from them by cultivation. In working these\r\nimportant changes, the Dutch and French gardeners have been the chief\r\nagents: hence our names, Red and White Dutch currants.\r\n\r\nThe common red and the common white are still cultivated in the great\r\nmajority of American gardens; and yet, they are not worthy to be named\r\nwith the White Dutch and the Red Dutch, which may easily be obtained by\r\nevery cultivator. These two varieties are all that ever need be\r\ncultivated. Long lists of currants are described in many of the\r\nfruit-books; the result, as in all such cases, is confusion and loss to\r\nthe mass of growers. We will not even give the list. The common red and\r\nthe white currants are greatly improved by cultivation. But the Dutch\r\nhave longer bunches, of larger fruit, the lower ones in the stem holding\r\ntheir size much better than common currants; the stems are usually full\r\nand perfect, and the fruit less acid and more pleasant.\r\n\r\nA new, strong-growing variety, called the \"cherry currant\" on account of\r\nits large size, is now considerably grown. A few bushes for variety, and\r\nfor their beautiful appearance, may be well enough; but it is not a very\r\ngood bearer, and therefore is not so profitable as the Dutch.\r\n\r\nThe Attractor is a new French variety, said to be valuable. Knight's\r\nEarly Red has the single virtue of ripening a few days earlier than the\r\nothers. The Victoria is perhaps the latest of all currants, hanging on\r\nthe bushes fully two weeks longer than others. The White Grape, the Red\r\nGrape, and the Transparent, are all good and beautiful. The utilitarian\r\nwill cultivate the Red Dutch and the White Dutch as his main crop, with\r\ntwo or three of the others for a variety. The amateur will get all the\r\nvarieties, and amuse himself by comparing their qualities, and trying\r\nhis skill at modifying them. As these efforts have resulted, in past\r\ntime, in the production of our best varieties, so they may, in future,\r\nin something far better than we yet have. There is no probability that\r\nany of our fruits have reached the acme of perfection.\r\n\r\nThe common black, or English black currant has long been cultivated. A\r\njam made of it is valuable for sore throat. The highest medical\r\nauthority pronounces black currant wine the best, in many cases of\r\nsickness, of any wine known. The Black Naples possesses the same\r\nvirtues, and being a much larger fruit, and more productive, should take\r\nthe place of the English black, and exclude it from all gardens.\r\n\r\n_Cultivation._--Currant-bushes should be set four feet apart each way,\r\nand the whole ground thoroughly mulched; it keeps down all weeds and\r\ngrass, saving all further labor in cultivation, and greatly increases\r\nthe size and quantity of the fruit. On nothing does mulching pay better.\r\n(See article Mulching.)\r\n\r\nAny good garden-soil is suitable for currants. On the north side of a\r\nwall or building, or in the shade of trees, they will be considerably\r\nlater. The same effect may be produced by covering bushes a part of the\r\ntime with blankets or mats. Some are retarded by this means, so as to be\r\nin perfection after others are gone: thus, the currant that naturally\r\ncomes to perfection about midsummer is preserved on the bushes until\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nMany cultivate currants in the tree form; allowing no sprouts from the\r\nroots, and no branches within a foot or two of the ground. This object\r\nis secured by cutting from the slip you are to plant, from which to\r\nraise a bush, all the lower buds to within two or three of the top, and\r\nthen pinching off at once all shoots that may start out of the stem\r\nbelow; this makes beautiful little shrubs, but the top is apt to be\r\nbroken off by the wind, and they must be replaced by new ones every four\r\nor five years. Downing strongly recommends it, but we can not do so. Let\r\nbushes grow in the natural way, removing all old, decaying branches, and\r\nall suckers that rise too far from the parent-bush, and keep the\r\nclusters of bushes and leaves thin enough to allow the sun free access,\r\nand prevent continued moisture in wet weather, which will rot the\r\nfruit, and you will find it the cheapest and best. We have seen quite as\r\nlarge and as fine fruit grow on such bushes, that we knew to be more\r\nthan twenty years old, as we ever saw of the same variety when\r\ncultivated in the tree form.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAIRY.\r\n\r\nFor cheese, the dairy should contain three rooms: one for setting the\r\nmilk, with suitable boilers, &c.; next, a press-room, in which the\r\ncheese should be salted, as given under article _Cheese_; the third, a\r\nstore-room. In all climates a cheese-house should be made as tight as\r\npossible;--thick stone walls are best; windows should be on two sides,\r\nnorth and west, but not on opposite sides, so as to create a draught:\r\nthis is no better for cheese or butter, and is always dangerous to the\r\noperator. Let all persons who would enjoy good health avoid a draught of\r\nair as they would an arrow. If your cheese-house can be shaded on the\r\neast, south, and west, by trees, and have only a northern exposure, it\r\nwill aid you much in guarding against extremes of heat and cold. Windows\r\nshould be fitted closely, and covered with wire-cloth on the outside, so\r\nas to exclude all flies.\r\n\r\nA dairy for butter needs but two rooms, and a cool, dry cellar, with\r\nwindows in north and west. The first room should be for setting and\r\nskimming the milk, and the other for churning and working the butter,\r\nand scalding and cleaning the utensils. If your milk-room can be a\r\nspring-house with stone-floor, and a little water passing over it, you\r\nwill find it a great benefit. The shade, situation of windows, avoiding\r\na current, &c., should be the same as in the cheese-dairy.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the taste of turnips or other food of cows in milk and\r\nbutter, put one quart of hot water into eight quarts of the milk just\r\ndrawn from the cow, and strain it at once. It has been recently\r\ndeclared, by intelligent farmers, that if you feed the turnips to cows\r\nimmediately after milking, the next milking, twelve hours after feeding\r\nthe roots, will be free from their taste or odor. The easiest remedy is\r\nthe boiling water.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLENSION OF FRUITS.\r\n\r\nThat there are instances of decided decline in the quality of fruits is\r\ncertain. But on the causes of those changes pomologists do not agree.\r\nOne theory is, that fruits, like animals and vegetables of former ages,\r\nmay decline and finally become extinct. Should this theory be\r\nestablished, the declension would be so gradual that a century would\r\nmake no perceptible change. But we do not credit the theory, even as\r\napplied to former geological periods in the history of our globe. The\r\nchanges of past ages, as revealed in geology, have been brought about,\r\nnot gradually, but by great convulsions of nature, such as volcanoes, or\r\nthe deluge, that resulted in the destruction of the old order of things,\r\nand in a new creation.\r\n\r\nThe true theory of this declension of varieties of fruits, is, that it\r\nis the result of repeated budding upon unhealthy stocks, and of neglect\r\nand improper cultivation. Apply the specific manures--that is, those\r\nparticularly demanded by a given fruit--prune properly, mulch well, and\r\nbud or graft only on healthy seedling stocks of the same kind, and,\r\ninstead of declension, we may expect our best fruits to improve\r\nconstantly, in quality and quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nDILL.\r\n\r\nAn herb, native in the south of Europe, and on the Cape of Good Hope. It\r\nis grown, particularly at the South, as a medicinal herb. The leaves are\r\nsometimes used for culinary purposes; but it is principally cultivated\r\nfor its sharp aromatic seed, used for flatulence and colic in infants,\r\nand put into pickled cucumbers to heighten the flavor. The seeds may be\r\nsown early in the spring, or at the time of ripening. A light soil is\r\nbest. Clear of weeds, and thin in the rows, are the conditions of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAINS.\r\n\r\nDrains are of two kinds--under-drains and surface-drains. The latter are\r\nsimply open ditches to carry off surface-water, that might otherwise\r\nstand long enough to destroy the prospective crop. These are frequently\r\nuseful along at the foot of hills, when they should be proportioned to\r\nthe extent of the surface above them. They are also very useful on low,\r\nlevel meadow-lands. Properly constructed, they will reclaim low swamps,\r\nand make them excellent land. Millions of acres of land in the United\r\nStates, as good as any we have, are lying useless, and spreading\r\npestilence around, that by this simple method of ditching might be\r\nturned to most profitable account. The direction of these drains should\r\nbe determined by the shape of the land to be drained by them--straight\r\nwhenever they will answer the purpose, but crooked when they will do\r\nbetter. On low and very level land, they should be not more than five\r\nrods apart; they should be three times as wide at the top as they are at\r\nthe bottom, and as deep as the width at the top; made so slanting, the\r\nsides will not fall in;--they should be so shaped as to allow only a\r\nvery gentle flow of the water: if it flows too rapidly, it will wash\r\ndown the sides, and obstruct the ditch, and waste the land. Excavations\r\nfor under-draining are made in the same way, only the top need not be so\r\nmuch wider than the bottom; it would be a waste of labor in excavating a\r\nuseless quantity of earth. There are four methods of filling up the\r\nditch, viz., with brush; with small stones thrown in promiscuously; with\r\na throat laid in the bottom and filled with small stones; and with a\r\nthroat made of tile from the pottery. In all cases, that with which the\r\nditch is filled must not come so near the surface as to be reached by\r\nthe plow. Brush, put in green and covered with straw or leaves, will\r\nanswer a good purpose for several years, and may be used where small\r\nstones can not easily be obtained. The tile is more expensive than\r\neither of the others, and not so good as the stones; it is so tight that\r\nthe water does not enter it so readily; and if by any chance dirt gets\r\ninto the throat, it obstructs it, and there is no other channel through\r\nwhich the water can pass off. Small stones thrown in promiscuously\r\nserve a good purpose for a long time, if they be covered with straw or\r\ncornstalks before the earth is put in. But the best method is to make a\r\nthroat, six inches square, in the bottom of the drain, laying the large\r\nstones over the top of it, and filling in the small stones above, and\r\ncovering with straw;--the water will find its way into the throat\r\nthrough the numerous openings; and if the throat should ever be filled,\r\nthe water could still pass off between the small stones above. Such\r\ndrains will last many years, and add one half to the products of all wet\r\nspringy land. The earth over the new drain should be six inches higher\r\nthan the surface of the field, that, when well settled, it may be level.\r\nLeave no places open for surface-water to run in; that would soon fill\r\nup and ruin a drain. Drains made to carry off spring-water are often\r\nuseless by being in a wrong location. Springs come out near the foot of\r\nrising ground. Just where they come out should be the location of the\r\ndrain, which would then carry off the water and prevent it from\r\nsaturating and chilling the soil in the field below. Many persons locate\r\ntheir ditch down in the centre of the wet level below the rise of\r\nground; this is of no use to the surface above, to the point where the\r\nwater springs. Locate the drain just at the point where the land begins\r\nto be unduly wet. On very wet, level land, a small drain may also be\r\nneeded below the first and main one. The cost of a covered drain as\r\ndescribed above will be from fifty to seventy-five cents per rod, and an\r\nuncovered one will cost from twenty to thirty cents. When you have low\r\nswamps to drain, you can realize more than the cost of draining, by\r\ncarting the excavations upon other land, or into the barnyard as\r\nmaterial for compost. Perhaps no expenditure, on land needing it, pays\r\nso well as thorough draining. It is important, for all fruit-orchards on\r\nlow land, to put a drain through under each row of trees: it is\r\nindispensable to cherries, and highly favorable to all other fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUCKS.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of varieties, the wild Black Spanish, the\r\nCanvass-Back, and the ordinary little duck of the farmyard, are all\r\ngood. The common duck is the only one we recommend for the American\r\npoultry-yard. A close pasture, including a rivulet, or a small stream of\r\nwater, affords facilities for raising ducks at a cheap rate. From one\r\nhundred to one thousand ducks may be raised in such an enclosure of an\r\nacre or two, quite profitably. If there is plenty of grass, they will\r\nstill need a little grain. In the winter the cheapest feed is beets or\r\npotatoes cut fine, with a very little grain. Each duck, well kept, will\r\nlay from fifty to one hundred eggs, larger than hen's eggs, and about as\r\ngood for cooking purposes. They may be picked as geese, for live\r\nfeathers, though not quite so frequently. The feathers will nearly pay\r\nfor keeping, leaving the eggs and increase as profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nDWARFING.\r\n\r\nThis has some advantages in its application to fruit-trees. It will\r\nenable the cultivator to raise more fruit on a small plat of ground, to\r\nget fruit much earlier than from standard trees, and sometimes, with\r\nhigh cultivation, the fruit will be larger. Dwarfing is done by grafting\r\ninto small slow-growing stocks. Almost all fruits have such kinds.\r\nGrafting into other stocks, as the pear into the foreign quince, is a\r\nvery effectual method. The Paradise stock for the apple, the Canada and\r\nother slow-growing stocks for the plum, the dwarf wild cherry of Europe\r\nand the Mahaleb for cherries. Dwarfs produced by grafting upon other\r\nstocks are short-lived, compared with standards of the same varieties.\r\nThey should only be used to economize room, to test varieties, and\r\nproduce fruit while standards are coming into bearing.\r\n\r\nBetter and much longer-lived dwarfs may be produced by frequent\r\ntransplanting, thorough trimming of the roots, and repeated heading-in.\r\nThe fruit on such dwarfs must be well thinned out when young, or it will\r\nbe smaller than is natural. The effect of heading in is to cause the sap\r\nto mature an abundance of fruit-buds. This will tax the tree too much,\r\nunless they be well thinned out. Root-pruning is an effectual method of\r\ndwarfing (see Pruning). Dwarfing by root-pruning, repeated\r\ntransplanting, and thorough heading-in, will not render the trees very\r\nshort-lived, and in many situations it is profitable. The same is true\r\nof the dwarf pear on the quince. All other dwarfing is more for the\r\namateur than the utilitarian.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES\r\n\r\nAre often considered a great luxury, and always command a high price.\r\nEarly vegetables are secured by hotbeds and the various methods of\r\nforcing, as given under the different species. Early fruits are obtained\r\nby dwarfing, as given on that subject. Location, soil, and mode of\r\ncultivation, also, have much to do with it. Warm location,\r\nfinely-pulverized soil, often stirred and kept moist, will materially\r\nshorten the time of the maturity of fruits and vegetables. Seeds\r\nimported from the North, where seasons are shorter, will mature earlier.\r\nAnother means of hastening maturity is to plant successively, from year\r\nto year, the very first that ripens; this tends to dwarf in proportion\r\nas the time of maturity is hastened. In this way such dwarfs as the\r\nlittle Canada corn, that will mature at the South in six weeks, have\r\nbeen produced. Various early plants, as tomatoes, cabbages, peppers, and\r\negg-plants, may be started in boxes or flower-pots in the house. Planted\r\nin February here, or in January in the South, they will grow as well as\r\nhouse-plants, and acquire considerable size before it is time to place\r\nthem in the open ground. This is convenient for those who have no\r\nhotbeds. They must be kept from frost, and occasionally set out in a\r\nwarm day to harden, and they will do well.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGG PLANT.\r\n\r\nThe white is merely ornamental. The large purple is one of the greatest\r\nluxuries of the vegetable garden. Plant seeds in hotbed at the time of\r\nplanting tomatoes or peppers. Set out in land made very rich with\r\nstable-manure and decayed forest-leaves, two feet and a half apart each\r\nway. Kept clean, and earthed up a little, and the bugs kept off while\r\nthe plants are small, they will produce an abundance of fruit. There are\r\ntwo varieties of the purple--_large prickly-stem purple_, growing\r\nsometimes eight inches in diameter; and the _long purple_, bearing\r\nsmaller, long fruit, but a large quantity, and considerably earlier than\r\nthe large. Many do not like them at first; but after tasting a few\r\ntimes, almost all persons become very fond of them. If not properly\r\ncooked, they are not at all palatable. Although it belongs to the\r\ncook-book, yet, to save this excellent plant from condemnation, we give\r\na recipe for cooking it. It is fit for use from one third grown, until\r\nthe seeds begin to turn. Without paring, cut the fruit into slices one\r\nthird of an inch thick; put it in a little water with plenty of salt,\r\nand let it stand over night, or six hours at least; take it out, and fry\r\nvery soft and brown in butter or fresh lard--if not fried soft and\r\nbrown, it is disagreeable. Salt, ashes, and bonedust, or superphosphate\r\nof lime, are the best manures, as more than two thirds of the fruit is\r\nmade up of potash, soda, and phosphates, as shown by chemical analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGGS.\r\n\r\nOf the quality of eggs you can always judge correctly by looking at them\r\ntoward the light: if they are translucent they are good; if they look\r\ndark they are old--or you may get a chicken, when you only paid for an\r\negg.\r\n\r\nMany methods for preserving eggs are recommended. Packed away in fine\r\nsalt they will keep, but, like salt meat, have not the same flavor as\r\nfresh. Set them on their small ends in a tight cask, and fill it with\r\npure lime-water, and they will keep, but it changes their flavor. This,\r\nhowever, is a very common method. The best way known to us, is to pack\r\nfresh eggs down in Indian meal, allowing no two to touch each other.\r\nKeep very dry in a cool cellar, and they will remain for months\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nELDERBERRY.\r\n\r\nThis is a healthy berry, dried and used for making pies, especially\r\nmixed with some other fruit. The blossoms are much used as medicine for\r\nsmall children. The common sweet elder is the only kind cultivated. The\r\nearlier red are offensive and poisonous. They are easily grown on rough\r\nwaste land, or in any situation you prefer. Of this berry is made a\r\nwine, superior in flavor and effect to any port wine now to be obtained\r\nin market; it has had the preference among the best judges in the\r\ncountry;--it is fast coming into notice and cultivation. The wine is so\r\nentirely superior to the poisonous substances of that name in commerce,\r\nthat it would be well for every neighborhood to make enough for their\r\nsick. The process is sure and easily intelligible to all. (See article\r\nWine.)\r\n\r\n\r\nENDIVE.\r\n\r\nThis is a well-known winter-lettuce. Sow from July to September,\r\naccording to latitude. It should come into maturity at the time of the\r\nfirst smart frosts. To get beautiful, white, tender bunches, they should\r\nbe tied up when the leaves are about six inches long. When frost comes,\r\nprotect by covering. In very cold climates, place it in the cellar, with\r\nthe roots in moist earth, and it will keep for a long time. It will not\r\nbe extensively used in this country for soups and stews, as it is in\r\nEurope; and but few of the American people care much about\r\nwinter-lettuce. This is the best variety of lettuce, except for those\r\nwho have hot-houses and attend to winter-gardening. They will prefer the\r\nother finer varieties. There are two varieties of endive cultivated in\r\nthis country: _green curled_, which is the most common, and used\r\nprincipally as a salad; the _broad-leaved_, or Batavian, has thicker\r\nleaves and large heads, and is principally used in stews and soups.\r\nStill another variety, called _succory_, which is used to some extent in\r\nEurope as a winter-salad, but is cultivated mainly for the root. It is\r\ndried and ground to mix with coffee: some consider it quite as good.\r\nThis is more cultivated at the South than at the North--their winters\r\nare much better adapted to it. The medicinal virtues of this plant are\r\nnearly equal to those of the dandelion. When it is bleached, by tying or\r\nearthing up, the bitterness is removed, and the taste is pleasant; this\r\nmust be done when the plants are dry, or they will rot. Plant them in a\r\nsunny place and in a light soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nFeed as nearly as possible at the same hours. All creatures do much\r\nbetter for being so fed. Do not feed domestic animals too much: animals\r\nwill be more healthy, grow faster, and fatten better, by being fed\r\nalmost, but not quite as much as they will eat. Giving food to lie by\r\nthem is poor economy; always let them eat it all up, and desire a little\r\nmore;--at the same time, let it be remembered that creatures kept very\r\npoorly for a considerable time, especially while young, will never fully\r\nrecover from it. This is often done under the idea of keeping them\r\ncheap, but it is dear keeping. They never can make as fine animals\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nAll grains and vegetables, except beets and turnips, are better for\r\nbeing boiled or steamed. The increased value is much more than the cost\r\nof cooking, provided persons are not so careless as to allow food to be\r\ninjured by standing after cooking. Cooking is supposed to add one fourth\r\nto the value of food. Grinding dry grains adds nearly as much to their\r\nvalue, as feed for animals, as cooking. If you neither grind nor boil\r\nhard grain for feed, it will pay well to soak it somewhat soft before\r\nfeeding. Variety of food is as pleasant and healthy for animals as for\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFENCES.\r\n\r\nThese are matters of great importance to the farmers of the whole\r\ncountry, but especially to those on the prairies of the west.\r\n\r\nIn all localities where stone can be obtained from the fields or quarry,\r\nthe best and cheapest fence is a stone wall. If the stones are flat,\r\nmake the wall two feet thick at bottom, and one at top, five feet high.\r\nIf the stones are very irregular the wall should be thicker. Stone walls\r\nshould have transverse rows of shingles, boards, or split sticks, about\r\nhalf an inch thick, laid in the wall at suitable distances. If stones\r\nare quite flat three rows are desirable, one two, the next three, and\r\nthe other four feet from the ground. If the wall is made of rough stones\r\nit will require one more course of sticks, leaving them only a foot\r\napart. The sticks should be of such lengths as to come out just even\r\nwith the wall, on each side. The lower courses will be longer than the\r\nupper ones. These sticks are to keep the wall from falling down. Dig a\r\nditch one foot deep, two feet from the wall, and throw the earth\r\nexcavated up against the wall, and the water will run off and prevent\r\nheaving by frost, and such a wall will need the merest trifle of\r\nattention during a generation, and will last for centuries. A cord of\r\nstones will make one rod. We can not too strongly recommend this kind of\r\nfence, in all places where stones can be obtained reasonably. The pieces\r\nof wood laid in a wall, will keep well for thirty years, when they will\r\nneed replacing. Next to stone is a good board fence. Well made and of\r\ngood materials, it is durable and always in its place. Hence it is a\r\ncheap fence.\r\n\r\nOf the various styles of picket, and other fancy fences for front yards,\r\n&c., it is more the province of the architect or the mechanic to treat.\r\nStyles vary and are constantly increasing in number. The great point to\r\nbe secured in all such, to render them most durable, is to have the\r\nsmallest possible points of contact. A picket fence with horizontal base\r\nshould never have the pickets standing on the base board. They should be\r\nseparated, from one quarter to one half an inch. A good style for\r\nvillages, is a cap, water tight, and wide enough to cover the ends of\r\nthe posts and pickets with a neat little cornice. It looks well and is\r\nvery durable.\r\n\r\nIn all localities where timber is not too valuable, a cheap and\r\nsubstantial fence is made of split rails. The crooked rail-fence, with\r\nstakes and riders, is well known. Also that with upright stakes and\r\ncaps, which is decidedly preferable. It will stand much longer, and the\r\nstakes are out of the way. No farmer should ever risk his crop with a\r\nrail-fence without stakes. But the best of all rail-fences, is that made\r\nof posts and rails. The rails are put in as bars, but so firmly that the\r\nfence can not be taken down, without commencing at the end. Where cedar\r\nor locust posts, and oak or cedar rails can be obtained, a fence may be\r\nmade that will not get out of repair for twenty-five years. No creature\r\ncan tear it down, for human hands can not take it down without tools, or\r\nwithout commencing at the end. This is considered expensive. But as the\r\nfarmer may prepare his posts and rails in winter, and it will require no\r\nattention to keep it up, and is very durable and perfectly effectual\r\nagainst cattle, it is an economical fence. For hedges, see that\r\narticle.\r\n\r\n\r\nFENNEL.\r\n\r\nThis is a hardy perennial plant of Southern Europe, and belongs to both\r\nthe culinary and the medicinal departments. It grows well on almost any\r\nsoil, and is propagated by seeds, offshoots, or by parting the roots. It\r\nis much inclined to spread. A few roots, kept within reasonable bounds,\r\nare enough for a family. It is much used in Europe for soups, salads,\r\nand garnishes. The Italians treat it as celery. In this country it is\r\nmostly used medicinally. It is stimulant and carminative. Very\r\nbeneficial to children in cases of flatulency and colic.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis fruit is native in the warmer parts of Asia: hence, the cold\r\nwinters of the Middle, Northern, and Western states, and of Canada,\r\nwould destroy the trees in the open air without protection. But as the\r\ntrees are low-growing shrubs, they may easily be protected either in\r\ncellars, greenhouses, or the open air, and uncovered or planted out in\r\nthe beginning of warm weather. Frequent removals and transplantings\r\ninjure the fig less than any other fruit, and our summers are long\r\nenough to produce large crops of excellent figs. In New England they are\r\nraised in tubs, set out of the cellar in spring, and produce largely.\r\nSouth of Virginia, the fig is hardy, and may be cultivated with profit\r\nin the open air. The best method of raising all kinds of fruit, in\r\nclimates where the winters are too cold for them, is to build a wall\r\ntwelve feet high on one side, and six feet on the other, with the ends\r\nclosed, and cover it with glass facing the south. This should only be\r\nkept warm enough to prevent freezing, which would require only a small\r\noutlay. Men of moderate means might thus have oranges, lemons, figs,\r\n&c., of their own raising. In all except our coldest latitudes, such\r\nfruits might be raised at a profit.\r\n\r\n_Soil._--The best is a deep, rich loam, with a dry subsoil.\r\n\r\n_Propagation_ is by layers and cuttings. The latter should be taken off\r\nin the spring, be of last year's growth, with half an inch of the\r\nprevious year's growth: they take root better.\r\n\r\n_Varieties_ are numerous, and names uncertain. White, in his Gardening\r\nfor the South, says, some of the best varieties are not in the books, or\r\nso imperfectly described that they can not be recognised. This is true\r\nof all the fruits, and hence our decision, in this work, not to attempt\r\nto describe fruits with a view to their identification. As this fruit is\r\nmore for the South than the North, we give the whole of White's list, as\r\nbeing adapted to those regions:--\r\n\r\n1, Brunswick; 2, Brown Turkey; 3, Brown Ischia; 4, Small Brown Ischia;\r\n5, Black Genoa; 6, Celestial; 7, Common Blue; 8, Round White, Common\r\nWhite, Lemon Fig; 9, White Genoa, White Italian; 10, Nerii; 11,\r\nPregussatta; 12, Allicant; 13, Black Ischia; 14, White Ischia. These,\r\nwith a few others, are those described in most of our fruit-books. The\r\ncatalogue of the London Horticultural Society enumerates forty-two\r\nvarieties. Only a few of them have been introduced into this country.\r\nAny of these varieties are good at the South. The five following are the\r\nmost hardy, and, being in all respects good, are all we need in our more\r\nnorthern latitudes:--\r\n\r\n1. _Brunswick._--Very hardy, productive, and excellent.\r\n\r\n2. _Brown Turkey._--The very hardiest, and one of the most regular and\r\nabundant bearers.\r\n\r\n3. _Black Ischia._--Bears an abundance of medium-sized, excellent fruit,\r\nvery dark-colored.\r\n\r\n4. _Nerii._--Said to be the richest fig in Britain: from an acid mixture\r\nin its flavor, it is exceedingly delicious.\r\n\r\n5. _Celestial._--This may be the \"Malta\" of Downing. Under whatever\r\nname, though small, it is one of the very best figs grown in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFor forcing under glass, the best are the Allicant and Marseilles. With\r\ncare, the first three of the above list may be raised in the Middle\r\nstates, without removal in winter. Any variety may be protected by\r\nbending and tying down the branches, and covering with four inches of\r\nsoil. Below Philadelphia, a little straw will be a sufficient\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nDried figs are an important article of import into this country; yet\r\nthey might be raised as plentifully and profitably in the Southern\r\nstates. Prune only to keep the tree low and regular. The fig-tree is a\r\ngreat and regular bearer, only when the wood makes too strong a growth,\r\nas it is somewhat apt to do. The remedy is _root-pruning_. Cut off, on\r\nthe first of November, the roots to half the length of the branches from\r\nthe tree, and occasionally shorten the branches a little, and the fruit\r\nwill be abundant, and not fall off. The ripening of the fruit may be\r\nhastened and perfected by putting a drop of oil in the blossom-end of\r\neach fig. This is done by dipping the end of a straw in oil, and then\r\nputting it into the end of the fruit. This is extensively practised in\r\nFrance. Compost, containing a pretty liberal proportion of lime, is the\r\nbest manure for the fig.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of fish is attracting much attention in this country and\r\nin Europe. The study and experiments of scientific and practical men\r\nhave established important facts upon this subject. Fish may be\r\nsuccessfully cultivated wherever water can be conveniently obtained. The\r\ncreeks, ponds, and small rivers of our land may be well stocked with\r\nfish. Fish may be raised as a source of profit and luxury, with as much\r\nease and certainty, and at a much less expense than fowls. This is so\r\nimportant to the whole people, that it demands the earnest attention of\r\nour state authorities, as it has engaged that of the government of\r\nFrance. The species of fish best adapted to artificial culture, in\r\nparticular climates and in different kinds of water, have been\r\nascertained. A man may know what fish to put in his waters, as well as\r\nwhat crops to put on his land, or what stocks on his farm.\r\n\r\nThe following brief synopsis of the best methods of cultivation will be\r\nsufficient to insure success. The first requisite is suitable water for\r\nhatching eggs that have been artificially fecundated, and for the\r\noccupancy of fish of different ages, and for different species of fish.\r\nFish of different ages are much inclined to destroy each other for food;\r\nand hence, in order to multiply them most rapidly, they should be kept\r\nin separate ponds until considerably grown, when they will take care of\r\nthemselves. A spring sending forth a rivulet of clear water, and not\r\nsubject to overflow in freshets, is the best location. Clear, cool water\r\nis essential to the trout, while some other fish will do well in warm\r\nand even roily water. The rivulet running from the spring should be made\r\nto form a succession of ponds, three or four in number. These ponds\r\nshould be connected with flumes made of plank. If the space they must\r\noccupy be small, make the flumes zigzag, to increase their length. Put\r\nacross those flumes, once in four or five feet, a piece of plank half as\r\nhigh as the sides of the flume, with a notch cut in the centre of the\r\ntop, that the fish may easily pass over: this will afford a succession\r\nof little falls, in which the trout very much delights. These different\r\nponds are for the occupancy of fish of different ages, one age only\r\ninhabiting one pond. The flumes should have four inches of fine and\r\ncoarse gravel in the bottom, making the most perfect spawning-ground.\r\nAlthough you would not wish the female-trout to deposite her eggs in the\r\nnatural way, but will extrude them by the hand (as hereinafter\r\ndirected), yet they must have these natural conveniences, or they will\r\nnot incline to spawn at all. At the upper end of each of these flumes\r\nseparating the ponds, there should be a gate of wire-cloth, to prevent\r\nthe passage of the fish from one pond to the other; also one at the\r\noutlet of the lower pond, to prevent egress of the fish. These must all\r\nbe so arranged that freshets will not connect them all together. When\r\ntrout are about to spawn in their natural waters, they select a gravelly\r\nmargin, and remove, from a circle of about one foot or two feet in\r\ndiameter, all the sediment, leaving only clean gravel, among which they\r\ndeposite their eggs, where they are hatched. They want running water of\r\nthree or four inches in depth for this purpose. A male and female occupy\r\neach nest. If left to themselves, they will gradually increase; but so\r\nmany of their eggs fail of being fecundated, and so many are destroyed\r\nbefore they hatch, by enemies, and by the collection of sediment in the\r\nnest, that the number of young fish is small compared with the whole\r\nnumber of eggs deposited. Artificial spawning, fecundation, and\r\nhatching, are far more productive. The process is simple and easy: when\r\nthe female-fish first begins to deposite her eggs, catch her with a\r\nsmall net. It can not be done with bait, for fish will bite nothing at\r\nthe time of spawning. We recollect, often when a boy, of trying to catch\r\ntrout out of the brooks in October, where we could see large, beautiful\r\nfish, lying lazily in the places from which we had caught many in the\r\nsummer, and put our bait carefully on every side of them, and they would\r\nnot bite. Then we knew not the cause: since studying the habits of fish,\r\nwe have learned that they never will bite while spawning; with trout,\r\nthis is done from the 1st to the 15th of October, some few spawning till\r\nthe last of November. Having caught two fish, male and female, take the\r\nfemale in one hand, and press her abdomen gently with the other hand,\r\ngradually moving it downward, and the eggs will be easily extruded, and\r\nshould fall into an earthen vessel of pure water. Then take the\r\nmale-fish, and go through the same process, which will press out the\r\nspermatic fluid, which should be allowed to fall into the same vessel\r\nwith the eggs; stir up the whole together, and, after it has stood\r\nfifteen minutes, pour off the water, put in more and stir it up, and let\r\nit stand as before. This having been done three times, the eggs will be\r\nthoroughly fecundated, and are ready to be deposited in the nests for\r\nhatching. If the fish are caught before the time of beginning to spawn,\r\nthe eggs and the spermatic fluid will not be mature, and will be only\r\nextruded by hard pressing, and failing to be fecundated, the eggs will\r\nperish. The fluid from one male will fecundate the eggs of half a dozen\r\nfemales. These eggs may be hatched in the flumes described above, though\r\nhatching-boxes are preferable. The old fish can be returned to the\r\nwater, and may live many years and produce thousands of fish. These\r\nfish, carefully treated and fed, will become so tame as to eat out of\r\nyour hand, like the \"Naiad Queen\" of Professors Ackley and Garlick, of\r\nCleveland, Ohio. Among all the hatching apparatus we have seen\r\ndescribed, we regard that of the above professors at Cleveland the best.\r\nTo these gentlemen the country is much indebted for the knowledge\r\nderived from their zeal and success in fish culture. At the head of a\r\nspring they built a house eight by twelve feet; in the end of the house\r\ntoward the spring they made a tank four feet wide, eight feet long, and\r\ntwo feet deep; this was made of plank. Water enters the tank through a\r\nhole near the top, and escapes through a similar one at the other end,\r\nand is received into a series of ten successive boxes, each one a little\r\nlower than the preceding one. These boxes were eighteen inches long,\r\neight inches wide, and six inches deep. These were filled to the depth\r\nof two inches with clean sand and gravel. The impregnated eggs were\r\nscattered among the gravel, care being exercised not to have them in\r\npiles or masses. Clean water is necessary, as the sediment deposited by\r\nimpure water is very destructive to the eggs. If it be seen to be\r\ncollecting, it should be removed by agitating the water with a\r\ngoose-quill or soft brush, and allowing it to run off; continue this\r\ntill it runs clear. But there is a method of preventing impurities in\r\nspring-water, that will be always effectual: just around on the upper\r\nside of the spring make a tight fence two feet high, and it will turn\r\naside, and cause to run around the spring, all the water that may flow\r\ndown the rise above in time of rains. The house being near the head,\r\nthere will not water enough get into the spring, in any storm, to roil\r\nthe water. On the side of the boxes where the water escapes should be\r\nwire-cloth, so fine as not to allow the eggs to pass through. Such an\r\napparatus will be perfect. This great care is only necessary for trout.\r\nAll other fish worthy of cultivation, will only need spawning-beds on\r\nthe margin of their pond. A convenient hatching apparatus is a number of\r\nwicker-baskets, fine enough not to allow the eggs to pass through, set\r\nin a flume of clear running water.\r\n\r\nThe method of Gehen and Remy, the great fish-cultivators of France,\r\nwhose efforts and discoveries have contributed more to this science than\r\nthose of any, if not of all other men, was to place the eggs in\r\nzinc-boxes of about one foot in diameter, having a lid over them--the\r\ntop and sides of the boxes pierced with small holes, smooth on the\r\ninside; these boxes were partly filled with clean sand and gravel, and\r\nset in clear running water. M. Costa's method, at the college of France,\r\nis to arrange boxes in the form of steps, the top one being supplied\r\nwith water by a fountain, and that passing from one to the other through\r\nall the series, and the eggs placed on willow-hurdles instead of gravel.\r\n\r\nAnother very simple method may be arranged in the house. It is a\r\nreservoir--a barrel or cask--set perhaps two and a half feet from the\r\nfloor, and a little hatching trough a few inches lower, into which water\r\ngradually runs through a faucet, from the reservoir. This water running\r\nthrough the hatching-box, escapes into a tub a little below. Whatever\r\nplan be adopted, great care is necessary in preventing sediment from\r\ndepositing. Cleanliness is a principal condition of success. The eggs of\r\nthe trout thus fecundated and deposited in October or November will\r\nhatch in the spring. Young trout need no feeding for a month after\r\nleaving the egg. There is a small bladder or vesicle under the fore part\r\nof the body, when they first come out, from which they derive their\r\nsustenance. After this disappears, or at the end of about a month, they\r\nshould be fed, in very small quantities. Too much will leave a portion\r\nto decay on the bottom and injure the water. The best possible food\r\n(except the angle-worm) is lean flesh of animals, boiled and hashed fine\r\nfor the young fish. The flesh of other kinds of fish, when they are\r\nplenty and not very valuable, would be very good. These young fish\r\nshould be kept in the first pond until a year old. Then let them into\r\nthe second pond, closing the gate after them, to make room for another\r\nbrood in the first pond. The next year let them into the third, and\r\nthose into the second that are now in the first, and so on till the\r\nfourth. In the last pond, those of different ages will all be large\r\nenough to take care of themselves. But sometimes a trout two years old\r\nis said to swallow one a year old. But when they get to be three or four\r\nyears old, this sort of cannibalism ceases. These principles can be\r\ncarried out in small streams, by constructing gates to keep sections\r\nseparate, and by forming banks and waste ways for water, with wire gates\r\nso high, that the water will not overflow in freshets, and carry the\r\nfish away. In taking trout use angle-worms or the fly. A fine\r\nlight-colored small line is best. They are very shy. The following is a\r\nlist of other fish, beside the trout, that are well worthy of\r\ncultivation:--\r\n\r\n_Black Bass._--When full grown, this fish is from twelve to eighteen\r\ninches in length. One of the better fish for the table, and profitable\r\nto raise in a pond covering not less than half an acre. Chub, being a\r\nvery prolific little fish, may be kept in the same pond as food for the\r\nblack bass and other large fish. They are very fond of them. Minnows are\r\nthe best bait for these fish, though they will bite a trolling hook of\r\nany ordinary kind. You may raise them as given for the trout above, or\r\nallow them to deposite their eggs in spawn beds of their own selection\r\nin their pond. They will do well in water less pure than is demanded for\r\nthe trout.\r\n\r\n_White Bass._--Not so large as the black bass. Seldom weighs more than\r\ntwo pounds. One of the best for food. Thrives well in small ponds.\r\nRequires the same treatment as the preceding. Spawns in May and hatches\r\nsoon. Easily caught, as he is a great biter, at almost any bait.\r\n\r\n_Grass Bass or Roach._--One of the most beautiful of the bass kind, and\r\nas a panfish highly esteemed. It prefers sluggish water, and hence is\r\nwell adapted to small artificial ponds. Spawns in May. May be treated as\r\nthe preceding. Bites the angle-worm well, and several other kinds of\r\nbait.\r\n\r\n_Rock Bass._--A small fish seldom reaching a pound in weight, but is\r\nfine and very easily raised in small ponds of any kind of water. Spawns\r\nin May and may be treated in all respects as the rest of the bass\r\nfamily, only it will flourish well in quite small ponds.\r\n\r\n_Pickerel._--Is one of the best of fish, weighs from three to fifteen\r\npounds. Suitable only for large ponds. Spawns early in the spring in the\r\nmarshy edges of sluggish water. The eggs may be procured and treated as\r\nthe trout, only cold running water is not necessary. Best caught by\r\ntrolling. It is not a good fish to raise with others, as it is apt to\r\neat them up.\r\n\r\n_Yellow Perch._--Is everywhere well known as a beautiful little\r\nfresh-water fish, and good for the table, at all seasons when the water\r\nis cool. Perfectly hardy and adapted to sluggish waters, it is one of\r\nthe best for artificial ponds. Treat like all the preceding; or allowed\r\nto take its own course in the pond, it will increase rapidly.\r\n\r\n_Sun-Fish._--Rarely weighs more than half a pound, but is a good\r\npan-fish. This and the grass bass and yellow perch may be put together\r\nin the same pond.\r\n\r\n_Eels._--May be cultivated with great success in almost any water. But\r\nwe are so prejudiced against them, never consenting to taste one, that\r\nwe can not speak in their favor. Of the methods of introducing fish into\r\nour rivers and creeks, from which they have nearly all been taken by the\r\nfishermen, it is not our design to treat. That subject may be found\r\nfully presented in treatises on fish culture, and should command the\r\nimmediate attention of the authorities in all the states.\r\n\r\nWe have here given all that is necessary to success among the masses all\r\nover the land. There is hardly a township in the United States or\r\nBritish provinces, where good fish-ponds might not be constructed so as\r\nto be a source of profit and luxury to the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nFish are so certainly and easily raised, that the practice of\r\ncultivating them should be universally adopted.\r\n\r\nTransporting fish alive is somewhat hazardous, especially if they be of\r\nconsiderable size. The difficulty is greatly lessened by keeping ice in\r\nthe water with the fish. Change water twice a day and keep ice in it,\r\nand you may safely transport fish around the globe. Eggs of fish are\r\nbest transported in boxes six inches square, filled with alternate\r\nlayers of sand and eggs scattered over. When full, make quite wet, and\r\nfasten on the cover. Other methods are adopted which will be easily\r\nlearned of those engaged in the trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAX.\r\n\r\nChange the seed every season. This will greatly increase the quantity,\r\nand improve the quality. In nothing else is it more important. In\r\nIreland, the great flax-growing country of the world, they always sow\r\nforeign seed when it can be procured. American seed is preferred, and\r\nbrings the highest price. Experiments with different seeds, on varieties\r\nof soils, are much needed. Changing from all the soils and latitudes of\r\nour country would be useful. The general rule, however, as with all\r\nseeds, is to change from colder to warmer regions.\r\n\r\n_Soils._--The best are strong alluvial soils. Any soil good for a garden\r\nis good for flax. As much clay as will allow soil soon to become dry and\r\neasily to be made mellow, is desirable; black loam, with hard, poor\r\nclay-subsoil, is also good. Mellow, friable soils are not more important\r\nto any other crop than to flax. Land must not be worked when too wet.\r\nThe land should be rich from a previous year's manuring. Salt, lime,\r\nashes, and plaster, are good applications to flax after it has come up.\r\nOn light soil with bad tillage, when the flax was so poor that the\r\ncultivator was about to plow it up, the application of three bushels of\r\nplaster, in the morning when the dew was on, produced a larger yield of\r\nbetter flax from an acre than adjoining growers got from two acres of\r\ntheir best land.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWERS.\r\n\r\nFloriculture is an employment appropriate to all classes, ages, and\r\nconditions. No yard connected with a dwelling is complete without a\r\nflower-bed. The cultivation of flowers is eminently promotive of health,\r\nrefinement of manners, and good taste. Constant familiarity with the\r\nmost exquisite beauties of nature must refine the feelings and produce\r\ngentleness of spirit. Association with flowers should be a part of every\r\nchild's education. Their cultivation is suitable for children and young\r\nladies in all the walks of life.\r\n\r\nHouse-plants, and bouquets in sick-rooms, are injurious; their influence\r\non the atmosphere of the rooms is unhealthy. But the cultivation of\r\nflowers in the garden or yard is in every way beneficial. We earnestly\r\nrecommend increased attention to flowers by the whole American people.\r\nThe necessary limits of our article will allow us to do but little more\r\nthan to call attention to the subject. Those who become interested will\r\nseek information from some of the numerous works devoted exclusively to\r\nornamental flowers.\r\n\r\nFlowers should be planted on rather level land, that the rains may not\r\nwash off the seeds and fine mould. Choose a southern or eastern exposure\r\nwhenever practicable. Avoid, as much as possible, planting in the shade.\r\n\r\n_Soil_--Should be a deep, rich mould, neither too wet nor too dry, and\r\nshould be enriched with a little compost, every year.\r\n\r\n_Sowing the Seeds_ is a most important matter in cultivating flowers.\r\nMany fail to come up, solely on account of improper planting. The seeds\r\nof most flowers are very fine and delicate. Planted in coarse earth,\r\nthey will not vegetate; planted near the surface in a dry time, they\r\nusually perish. It is best to cover all small flower-seeds, by sifting\r\nfine mould upon them; and if the weather does not do it, use artificial\r\nmeans to keep the soil suitably moist until the seeds are fairly up.\r\nStir the soil gently often, and keep out all weeds. It is always best to\r\nplant the seeds in rows or hills, with small stakes to indicate their\r\nlocation; you can then stir the ground freely without destroying them.\r\nFlowers usually need more watering than most other plants. The usual\r\napplication of water to the leaves by using a sprinkler is injurious; it\r\nmay be better than no watering at all, but is the worst way to apply\r\nwater. Make a basin in the soil near the plants, and fill it with water.\r\nThe selection of suitable varieties for a small flower-garden is quite\r\nimportant. We shall only mention a brief list. Those who would make this\r\nmore of a study, are recommended to study \"_Breck's Book of Flowers_,\"\r\nwhich is quite as complete for American cultivators as anything we have.\r\nThe principal divisions are, bulbous flowering roots, flowering shrubs,\r\nand flowering herbs--annual, biennial, and perennial--the first\r\nblossoming and dying the year they are sown; the second blossoming and\r\ndying the second year, without having blossomed the first; the last\r\nblossoming, and the top dying down and coming up the next spring, for a\r\nseries of years.\r\n\r\n_Bulbous Flowering Roots._--These need considerable sand in their soil.\r\nThey should be taken up after the foliage is all dead, and if they are\r\nhardy, put the soil in good condition, and dry the bulbs and reset them,\r\nand let them remain through the winter. They may need slight protection,\r\nby spreading coarse straw, manure, or forest-leaves over them late in\r\nthe fall; but all the more tender bulbs do better kept in sand until\r\nearly spring. The best list with which we are acquainted, for a small\r\ngarden, is the following: the well-known lilies, the tulips, gladiolas,\r\nhyacinths, Feraria tigrida, crocus, narcissus, and jonquils.\r\n\r\n_Flowering Shrubs._--The following is a select small list: Roses, as\r\nlarge a variety as you please, out of the hundreds known; flowering\r\nalmond, Indigo shrub, wahoo or fire-shrub, the mountain-ash, althea,\r\nsnowball, lilac, fringe-tree, snow-drop, double-flowering peach,\r\nSiberian crab, the smoke-tree, or French tree, or Venitian sumach,\r\nhoneysuckle, double-flowering cherry.\r\n\r\nThe list of beautiful herbaceous flowers is very lengthy. We give only a\r\nfew of those most easily raised, and most showy; the list is designed\r\nonly to aid the inquiries of those who are unacquainted with them:\r\nsuperb amaranth, tri-colored amaranth, China and German astors--the\r\nlatter are very beautiful--Canterbury bell, carnation pinks (great\r\nvariety), chrysanthemum (many varieties and splendid until very late in\r\nautumn), morning glory or convolvulus, japonicas, Cupid's car, dahlias,\r\ndwarf bush, morning bride or fading beauty, fox-glove, golden coreopsis\r\n(we have raised a variety that proved biennial, which was superb all the\r\nseason), ice-plant, larkspur, passion-flower, peony, sweet pea, pinks,\r\nsweet-williams, annual China pink, polyanthus (a great beauty), hyacinth\r\nbean, scarlet-runner bean, poppy, portalucca, nasturtium, marigolds\r\n(especially the large double French, and the velvet variegated),\r\nmartineau, cypress vine.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOWLS.\r\n\r\nWe are glad to believe that _the hen mania_, that has prevailed so\r\nextensively during the last fifteen or twenty years, has considerably\r\nabated. After all the extravagant notions about the profits of hens\r\nshall have passed away, the truth will be seen to be about the\r\nfollowing: Every farmer who has considerable waste grain about, and\r\nplenty more to supply the deficiency when the fowls shall have gathered\r\nup all the scatterings, had better keep a hundred hens. If he has sand\r\nand gravel, and wheat-bran and lime for shells, within their reach, and\r\nplenty of fresh water, they will do well, without much further care, in\r\nmild weather. In cold weather in winter, keep not more than forty hens\r\ntogether, in a tight, warm place, well ventilated; give them their usual\r\nfood, with burnt bones pounded fine and mixed with mush, given warm,\r\nwith occasionally a little animal food and boiled vegetables, and they\r\nwill lay more than in summer. They will lay all winter without being\r\ninclined to set. Every family, who will treat them as above, may\r\nprofitably keep one or two dozen through the winter. Most persons who\r\nundertake, with a few acres of land, to keep fowls as a business, will\r\nlose by it. A few only of the most experienced and careful can make\r\nmoney by it. It may be cheapest for some persons to raise a few chickens\r\nfor their own use, although they cost them more than the market-price,\r\nthough it would not be best to raise chickens in that way to sell. \"But\r\nsome one raised the chickens in market for the market-price, and why not\r\nI?\" Because, they raised a few that got fat on waste grain, and you must\r\nbuy grain for yours, and give more for it than you can get for your\r\nchickens. Whoever would make money by raising fowls on a large scale,\r\nmust first serve some kind of an apprenticeship at it, as in all other\r\nbusiness. Get this experience, and learn by experiment the cheapest and\r\nmost profitable food, and keep from five hundred to a thousand fowls,\r\nand a reasonable though not large profit may be realized. For\r\nstore-fowls, boiled vegetables and beets cut very fine, with a little\r\nmeal mixed in, are a good and cheap feed. When keeping fowls out-door in\r\nwarm weather, keep no more than fifty together, and them on not less\r\nthan one fourth of an acre of land. The expensive hen-houses and\r\nartificial nests are mostly humbugs. Have many places of concealment\r\nabout, where they can make their nests as they please. When a hen begins\r\nto set, remove her, nest and all, to a yard to which layers have no\r\naccess, and you need have no difficulty with her. Set a hen near the\r\nground, in a dry place, on fifteen fresh eggs, all put under her at\r\nonce, and they will hatch about the same time at the end of twenty days.\r\nOld hens, of the common kind, are best to set. Let them have their own\r\nway in everything but running in the wet with their young chickens--and\r\nthat they will not be much inclined to do if they are well fed. Much is\r\nsaid about the diseases of fowls and their remedies. We have very little\r\nconfidence in any of it. Sick chickens will die _unless they get well_.\r\nTime spent in doctoring them does not generally pay. Wormwood and tansy,\r\ngrowing, or gathered and scattered, or steeped and sprinkled about the\r\npremises occupied by hens, will protect them from small vermin. Never\r\ngive them anything salt or sour, unless it be sour milk. The eggs of\r\nducks, turkeys, or geese, may be hatched under hens. Time, thirty days.\r\nHence, if put under with hens' eggs, they must be set ten days earlier,\r\nthat they may all hatch at once. Fattening chickens may be well done in\r\nsix days, by feeding rice, boiled rather soft in sweet skimmed milk, fed\r\nplentifully three times a day. Feed these in pans, well cleaned before\r\neach meal, and give only what they will eat up at once, and desire a\r\nvery little more. Put a little pounded charcoal within their reach, and\r\na little rice-water, milk, or clear water. This makes the most beautiful\r\nmeal at a low price. Never feed a chicken for sixteen or twenty-four\r\nhours before killing it.\r\n\r\n_Varieties or Breeds._--This has been matter of much speculation. The\r\nresult has been (what was probably a main object) the sale of many fowls\r\nand eggs at exorbitant prices. When chickens have sold at fifty dollars\r\nper pair, and eggs at six dollars a dozen, some persons must have made\r\nmoney, while others lost it. Yet, there is some choice in the breed of\r\nhens. The kind makes less difference, as far as flesh is concerned, than\r\nis usually imagined. It requires about a given quantity of grain to make\r\na certain amount of flesh. Large fowls give us much larger weight of\r\nflesh than small ones, but they also eat a much larger quantity of\r\ngrain. Large fowls are certainly large eaters. The three best layers are\r\nthe black Polands, the Malayas, and the Shanghaes. Half-bloods, by\r\ncrossing with the common fowl, are better for this country than either\r\nof the above, pure. Fowls are generally improved by frequent crossing.\r\nThe best we have ever had, for their flesh, we produced by putting a\r\nblack Poland rooster with common hens; they grew larger than either, and\r\ntheir flesh was very fine. Shanghaes and half-blood Shanghaes have\r\nproved permanently the best layers we have ever had. Early pullets make\r\ngreat fall and winter layers, and late chickens are great layers in the\r\nspring, when older ones wish to set.\r\n\r\nDucks we have considered in a separate article. We shall do the same\r\nwith turkeys. Killing, dressing, and preparing all fowls for market,\r\nwill be treated under the head of \"Poultry.\" Geese will also be\r\nconsidered in another place. We should give drawings of aviaries, but we\r\nconsider these generally worse than useless, as they are usually\r\nconstructed. An airy place for summer, and a warm room for winter, poles\r\nwith _rough bark_ on for roosts, and plenty of feed and water, sand,\r\ngravel, and lime, will give abundant success.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT.\r\n\r\nThe value of fruit is not fully appreciated in this country. As an\r\narticle of diet nothing is more natural and healthy. The Creator gave\r\nthis to man for food, when human nature, physically, was in its normal\r\ncondition. And why meats have since been allowed, I know not, unless it\r\nbe the reason why Moses allowed divorce in certain cases, although it\r\nwas not so in the beginning, viz., the hardness of their hearts. Why the\r\nstomach, upon the healthy condition of which all physical, mental, and\r\nmoral functions so materially depend, should be made the receptacle of\r\ndead animals, and especially those so long dead, as much of the meat\r\noffered in market, it would puzzle a philosopher to tell.\r\n\r\nBut we will not write an elaborate article on the healthfulness of a\r\ndiet composed mainly of milk, fruits, and vegetables. Suffice it to say\r\nthat experience and observation, as well as analysis and physiology,\r\nunite in demonstrating that ripe fruits contain virtues, that go far\r\ntoward preventing the ordinary diseases of men. They are good, plain or\r\ncooked, and for sick or well persons, except in extreme cases. They\r\nregulate the bowels and control the secretions, better than any other\r\narticle of food. They are so highly nutritious, that they sustain nature\r\nunder arduous toil, better than either meat, fine bread, or the Irish\r\npotato. With proper care the fruits are cheaper than any other article\r\nof food. They can be raised cheaper than corn or potatoes. They may be\r\nenjoyed all the year, are profitable for market, and for food for\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUITFULNESS.\r\n\r\n_Inducing it in Fruit-Trees._--Fruit-trees often grow luxuriantly, but\r\nbear no fruit, or very little. In nearly all cases the evil may be\r\nremedied. One remedy is shortening in. This is done by cutting off half\r\nthe present year's growth in July. This checks the tendency of the sap\r\nto promote so large a growth, and forces it to mature blossom-buds for\r\nthe next season. Another effectual means is to bend down all the\r\nprincipal branches and tie them down. This has a great influence in\r\nchecking excessive growth and forming fruit-buds. Frequent transplanting\r\nhas a tendency also to induce fruitfulness. Root pruning is one of _the\r\nbest means_ of securing this object. Lay bare the upper roots and cut\r\noff all the larger ones two feet from the tree. This will check\r\nexcessive formation of wood and foliage, render the wood firm, and the\r\norganic matter of the sap will form abundance of fruit-buds. These\r\nmethods will produce fruit in abundance on nineteen twentieths of barren\r\nor poor-bearing fruit-trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN.\r\n\r\nThe garden has been the most delightful abode of man ever since his\r\ncreation, before and since the fall. One of the most pleasant pastimes,\r\nfor ladies and children, is gardening. The flower, vegetable, and fruit\r\ndepartments are all pleasant and healthful.\r\n\r\n_Situation_ of a garden is important. This varies with climates. In a\r\ncold country the warmest exposures are best, and in a hot climate select\r\nthe coolest. A garden combining both is the best possible. The warmest\r\nexposure is good for early vegetables, and the cooler and more shady for\r\nthe main crop. Much can be done to regulate this by fences and\r\nbuildings. They will be warm and early on one side, and cool and late on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n_Soil._--A rich loam is always best. To convert stiff clay, or light\r\nsand and gravel, into a good loam, is an easy matter on so small a plat\r\nas is usually devoted to a garden. Draw an abundance of sand on\r\nclay-ground, plow deep and mix well, and one winter's frost will so\r\npulverize the whole that it will be in excellent condition. In warm\r\nclimates, the incorporation of the sand with the clay is effected by\r\nfrequent plowing and rains. On sand and gravel draw plenty of clay and\r\nloam, if it can be easily procured; thus it is easy to form a good\r\nfriable, retentive loam, adapted to every variety of soil-culture.\r\nDecayed wood and forest-leaves are excellent for garden-soils. Manure\r\nwell; but remember that it is possible to overfeed the soil of a garden,\r\nso as to render it unproductive. Deep plowing or spading is very\r\nimportant; it is the best possible remedy for excessive drought or\r\nunusual rains. The water will not stand on the surface when it first\r\nfalls, and will be retained long in the soil for the use of the plants.\r\nThe soil should be very mellow. Plowing or spading too early, in hope of\r\ngetting earlier vegetables, is often a failure. The earlier the better,\r\nif you can pulverize the soil; otherwise not. Plowing when covered with\r\na heavy dew, or when it rains gently, is equal to a good coat of manure.\r\nA garden should be on level land well drained; if much inclined, rains\r\nwill wash off the best of the soil, and destroy many seeds and plants.\r\nNo weeds should be allowed to grow to any considerable size in a garden.\r\nEarly and frequent hoeings are important to success. Directions for the\r\ncultivation of each garden vegetable and fruit are given under each of\r\nthose articles respectively. Methods of gardening at the South and the\r\nNorth vary but little in the main articles. At the North we have to\r\nguard against too much cool weather, and at the South against too much\r\nheat. Some vegetables that need planting on ridges in the North, to\r\nobtain more sun and heat, should be planted on level land at the South,\r\nto guard against too much heat and drought. Besides this, the main\r\ndifference is in the time of planting, which varies more or less with\r\nevery degree of latitude, or every five hundred feet of elevation. Have\r\nno fruit-trees in your vegetable or fruit garden, unless it may be a few\r\ndwarf-pears on the quince-stock, and these had better be by themselves.\r\n\r\nThe plan of a garden is a matter of taste, and depends much upon its\r\nsize and necessary situation. We prefer ornamental shrubs in front of\r\nthe house, the flowers adjoining it and passing the windows of those\r\nrooms that are constantly occupied, and the fruit-department in the\r\nrear of the flowers, while the vegetable-garden should be at the right\r\nor left of the fruit, and in the rear of the kitchen. On the other side\r\nof the house should be the larger fruit-trees, extending back as far as\r\nthe fruit and vegetable garden, and in the rear of it, the\r\ncarriage-house and other out-buildings. The best fence is of good\r\nwrought iron, sharp and strong enough to exclude all intruders. When\r\nthis can not be afforded, a good hedge, made of the plants best adapted\r\nto hedges in your latitude, is preferred; next to this a good tight\r\nboard-fence.\r\n\r\nAll fruit-gardens should have alleys, eight or ten feet wide, within\r\nfour rods of each other, to afford space for carting on manures, &c. A\r\nvegetable-garden of one acre should have such an alley through the\r\ncentre each way, with a place in the end, opposite the entrance, to turn\r\naround a summer-house, arbor, or tool-house. One rod from the fence, on\r\nall sides, should be an alley four or five feet wide; other small alleys\r\nas convenience or taste may require. The usual way is to sink the alleys\r\nthree or four inches below the level of the beds, and cover with gravel,\r\ntanbark, shells, &c. We strongly recommend raising the alleys in their\r\nmiddle, at least four inches above the surface of the beds. The paths\r\nare always neater, and the moisture is retained for the use of the\r\nplants. Excessive rains can be allowed to pass off. This making alleys\r\nlow sluice-ways for water is a great mistake in yards and gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARLIC.\r\n\r\nThis is a hardy perennial plant, from the south of Europe, and has been\r\nin cultivation, as a garden vegetable, for hundreds of years. It is\r\ncultivated as the onion, and needs much ashes, bonedust, and lime, in\r\nthe soil. It is much esteemed in some countries, in soups. It is but\r\nlittle used in the United States: it is used at the South as a medicinal\r\nherb. We know of no important use of garlic for which onions will not\r\nanswer as well, and therefore do not recommend garlic as an American\r\ngarden vegetable. Those who wish to cultivate it will pursue the same\r\ncourse as in raising onions from sets. This will always be successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nGATHERING FRUITS.\r\n\r\nThis is almost as important as proper cultivation. This is especially\r\ntrue of the pear. Many cultivators raise inferior pears from trees of\r\nthe very best varieties, for want of a correct knowledge of the best\r\nmethods of gathering, preserving, and ripening the fruit. Complete\r\ndirections will be found under each fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEESE.\r\n\r\nFarmers usually are opposed to keeping geese, believing them to destroy\r\nmore than they are worth. If you have a suitable place to keep them,\r\nthey may be profitable. They should have a pasture with a fence they can\r\nnot pass, enclosing a spring, pond, or stream. They do better to have a\r\nlittle grain the year round. This, with plenty of grass in summer and\r\ncut roots in winter, will keep them in fine condition. The feathers will\r\npay the cost of keeping, leaving the increase and feathers of the young\r\nas profit. On an acre or two, one hundred geese may be kept, and if the\r\nproportion of males and females be right, they will yield a profit of\r\ntwo dollars each.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOSEBERRY.\r\n\r\nThis is a native of the north of Europe and Asia, from which all our\r\nfine varieties have been produced by cultivation. Our own native\r\nvarieties are not known to have produced any very desirable ones.\r\nProbably the zeal of the Lancashire weavers, in England, will surpass\r\nall that Americans will do for the next century in gooseberry culture.\r\nThey publish a small book annually, giving an account of new varieties.\r\nThe last catalogue of the London Horticultural Society mentions one\r\nhundred and forty-nine varieties, as worthy of cultivation. A few only\r\nshould receive attention among us. Gooseberries delight in cool and\r\nrather moist situations. They do not flourish so naturally south of\r\nPhiladelphia; though they grow well in all the mountainous regions, and\r\nmay produce fair fruit in many cool, moist situations. Deep mulching is\r\nvery beneficial; it preserves the moisture, and protects from excessive\r\nheat. The land must be trenched and manured deep. In November, cut out\r\none half of the top, both old and new wood, and a good crop of fine\r\nfruit may be expected each year, for five or six years, when new bushes\r\nshould take the place of old ones. Propagate by cuttings of the last\r\ngrowth. Cut out all the eyes, below the surface, when planted. Plant six\r\ninches deep in loam, in the shade. Press the soil close around them. To\r\nprevent mildew, it is recommended to sprinkle lime or flour of sulphur\r\nover the foliage and flowers, or young fruit. The fruit-books recommend\r\nthe best varieties, and very open tops, as not exposed to mildew. We\r\nrecommend spreading dry straw, or fine charcoal, on the surface under\r\nthe bushes, as a perfect remedy, if the top be not left too thick. There\r\nis no necessity for mildew on gooseberries. The fall is much the best\r\nseason for trimming, though early spring will do. Varieties are divided\r\ninto red, green, white, and yellow. These are subdivided into hundreds\r\nof others, with names entirely arbitrary. The following are the best\r\nvarieties, generally cultivated in this country:--\r\n\r\n1. _Houghton's Seedling._--Flavor, superior; skin, thin and tender;\r\ncolor, reddish-brown. Prodigious grower and bearer--none better known.\r\nFree from mildew. Native of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n2. _Red Warrington._--Later and larger than the preceding; hangs long on\r\nthe bush without cracking, and improves in flavor.\r\n\r\n3. _Woodward's Whitesmith_--is one of the best of the white varieties.\r\n\r\n4. _Cleworth's White Lion._--Large and late; excellent.\r\n\r\n5. _Collier's Jolly Angler_--is a good green gooseberry; fruit large,\r\nexcellent, and late.\r\n\r\n6. _Early Green Hairy._--Very early; rather small; prolific.\r\n\r\n7. _Buerdsill's Duckwing_--is a good, late, yellow gooseberry; large\r\nfruit, and a fine-growing bush.\r\n\r\n8. _Prophets Rockwood._--Very large fruit of excellent quality, ripening\r\nquite early.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing list, giving two of each of the four colors, and early and\r\nlate, are all, we think, that need be cultivated. Many more varieties,\r\nnearly equalling the above, may be selected; but we are not aware that\r\nany improvement would be made. Downing gives the following list for a\r\ngarden:--\r\n\r\n_Red._--Red Warrington, Companion, Crown Bob, London, Houghton's\r\nSeedling.\r\n\r\n_Yellow._--Leader, Yellow Ball, Catharine, Gunner.\r\n\r\n_White._--Woodward's Whitesmith, Freedom, Taylor's Bright Venus, Tally\r\nHo, Sheba Queen.\r\n\r\n_Green._--Pitmaston Green Gage, Thumper, Jolly Angler, Massey's Heart of\r\noak, Parkinson's Laurel.\r\n\r\nThus you have Downing's authority; his list includes most of those we\r\nhave recommended above. The varieties are less important than in most\r\nfruits, provided only you get the large varieties of English gooseberry.\r\nProper cultivation will insure success. Whoever cultivates, only\r\ntolerably well, the Houghton Seedling, will be sure to raise good\r\nberries, free from mildew.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAFTING.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the leading methods of obtaining such fruits as we wish,\r\non stocks of such habits of growth and degrees of hardiness, as we may\r\ndesire. The stock will control, in some degree, the growth of the scion,\r\nbut leave the fruit mainly to its habits on its original tree. The\r\nadvantages of grafting are principally the following:--\r\n\r\nGood varieties may be propagated very rapidly. A single tree may produce\r\na thousand annually, for a series of years. Large trees of worthless\r\nfruit may be changed into any variety we please, and in a very short\r\ntime bear abundantly. Fruits not easily multiplied in any other way, can\r\nbe rapidly increased by grafting. Early bearing of seedlings can be\r\nsecured by grafting on bearing trees.\r\n\r\nTender and exotic varieties may be acclimated by grafting into\r\nindigenous stocks. Fruit can be raised on an uncongenial soil, by\r\ngrafting into stocks adapted to that soil. Several varieties may be\r\nproduced on the same tree, for ornament or economy of room. Dwarfs of\r\nany variety may be produced by grafting on dwarf stocks, and we may thus\r\ngrow many trees on a small space. A slow-growing variety may be made to\r\nform a large top, by grafting into large vigorous-growing stocks. We are\r\nenabled to carry varieties to any part of the world, at a cheap rate, as\r\nthe scions, properly done up, may safely be carried around the globe.\r\n\r\n_Time of Grafting._--Grafts may be made to live, put in in any month of\r\nthe year, but the beginning of the opening of the buds in spring, is the\r\npreferable season. Stone fruits should be budded; and all fruits may be\r\nmade to do well budded. Budding is usually only practised on small\r\ntrees, while grafting may be performed on trees of any size.\r\n\r\n_Cutting and preserving Scions._--Mature shoots of the previous year's\r\ngrowth are best. Those of the year before will also do. They may be cut\r\nat any time from November to time of setting. Perhaps the month of\r\nFebruary is best. They may be well preserved in moist sawdust in tight\r\nboxes. The more there are together the better they will keep. They keep\r\nbetter by being cut a little below the beginning of the last year's\r\ngrowth, but it is more injurious to the tree. They may be kept well in\r\nfine sand, moist and cool. Too much moisture is always injurious. Put\r\nthe lower ends in shallow water, and they will look very fine, but not\r\none of them will live. Scions cut in the fall and buried six inches deep\r\nin yellow loam or fine sand, will keep well till next spring. There are\r\nseveral methods of grafting only two of which deserve particular\r\nattention. These are cleft-grafting and tongue or splice grafting, see\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cleft-Grafting.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tongue-Grafting.]\r\n\r\n_Cleft-Grafting_ is performed in most cases, when scions are grafted\r\nupon stocks much larger than themselves. It is too well known to need\r\nparticular description. Tools should be sharp, and it should be\r\nperformed before the bark slips so easily as to be started by splitting\r\nthe stock. It endangers the growth of the scions. The requisite to\r\nsuccess in all grafting, is to have some point of actual contact,\r\nbetween the inside barks of both the scion and the stock. This is more\r\ncertainly secured by causing the scion to stand at a slight angle with\r\nthe stock.\r\n\r\n_Tongue-Grafting_ is generally used in grafting on small\r\nstocks--seedlings or roots. With a sharp knife, cut off the scion\r\nslanting down, and the stock slanting up, split each in the centre, and\r\npush one in to the other until the barks meet, and wind with thick paper\r\nor thin muslin, with grafting wax on one side. This is generally used in\r\nroot-grafting. The question of root-grafting has excited considerable\r\ndiscussion recently. Many suppose it to produce unhealthy trees, and\r\nthat retaining the variety is less certain than by other modes.\r\nRoot-grafting is a cheap and rapid means of multiplying trees, and hence\r\nis greatly prized by nursery men. Practical cultivators of Illinois have\r\nassured us, that it is impossible to produce good Rhode Island greenings\r\nin that state, by root-grafting--that they will not produce the same\r\nvariety. We see no principle upon which they should fail, but will not\r\nundertake to settle this important question. For ourselves we prefer to\r\nuse one whole stock for each tree, cutting it off at the ground and\r\ngrafting there.\r\n\r\n_Grafting Composition or Wax._--One part beef's tallow, two parts\r\nbeeswax, and four parts rosin, make the best. Harder or softer, it is\r\nliable to be injured by the weather. Warm weather will melt it, and cold\r\nwill crack it. Melt these together and pour them into cold water, and\r\npull and work as shoemaker's wax. When using, it is to be kept in cool\r\nor warm water, as the weather may demand. In its application, it is to\r\nbe pressed closely over all the wound made by sawing and splitting the\r\nlimb, and close around the scions, so as to exclude air and water. Clay\r\nis often used for grafting, but is not equal to wax. You can use\r\ngrafting tools, invented especially for the purpose, or a common saw,\r\nmallet, knife, and wedge.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPES.\r\n\r\nThose cultivated so extensively in Europe were natives of\r\nPersia--showing that they may be acclimated far from their native home.\r\nForeign grapes are not suitable for out-door culture in this country,\r\nexcept a very few varieties, which do well in the Southern states. The\r\nnative grapes of this country have produced some excellent varieties,\r\nwhich are now in general cultivation. Others are beginning to attract\r\nnotice, and seedlings will probably multiply rapidly, and great\r\nimprovements in our native grapes may be expected. The subject of\r\ngrape-culture deserves greatly-increased attention. To all palates the\r\ngrape is delicious; it is not only one of the most palatable articles of\r\ndiet, but is more highly medicinal than any other fruit. It is the\r\nnatural source of pure wine. Pure wine made of grapes is only to be\r\nprocured, in this country, by domestic manufacture. Probably not one out\r\nof a thousand gallons of imported wines, sold as pure, contains a drop\r\nof the juice of the grape;--they are manufactured of poisonous drugs and\r\nardent spirits--generally common whiskey. A French chemist discovered a\r\nmethod of imitating fermented liquor without fermentation, and distilled\r\nspirits without distillation. His process has been published in this\r\ncountry in book form, and by subscription; and while those books are\r\nunknown in the bookstores, they are generally possessed by prominent\r\nliquor dealers;--and the practice of those secret arts is terribly\r\ndangerous to the community. Antecedent to this chemical manufacture of\r\npoisonous liquors, such a disease as _delirium tremens_ was unknown.\r\nThus the Frenchman's discovery filled the liquor-sellers' pockets with\r\ncash, and the land with mourning, over frequent deaths by a disease, the\r\nhorror of which is equalled only by hydrophobia. In self-defence, all\r\nshould give up the use of everything purporting to be imported wines or\r\nliquors. Wine should not be used as a common beverage by the healthy.\r\nThe best medical authority in the world has pronounced it absolutely\r\ninjurious. But in many cases of sickness, especially in convalescence\r\nfrom fevers, it is one of the very best articles that can be used;\r\nhence, a pure article, of domestic manufacture, should be accessible to\r\nall the sick. (See our article on \"Wine.\") The luxury of good grapes can\r\nbe enjoyed by every family in the land who have a yard twenty feet\r\nsquare. In the cities, almost every house may have a grapevine or two\r\nwhere nothing else would grow. Allow a vine to run up trellis-work in\r\nthe rear of the house, and over the roof of a wing, or rear-part, raised\r\ntwo feet above the roof, supported by a rack. In such situations they\r\nwill bear better than elsewhere, will be out of the way, and decidedly\r\nornamental. In such small yards, from five to twenty-five bushels have\r\noften grown in a season. Some climates and soils are much better suited\r\nto grape-culture than others. But we have varieties that will flourish\r\nwherever Indian corn will mature.\r\n\r\n_Location._--For vineyards, the sides of hills are usually chosen,\r\nsometimes for the purpose of a warm exposure, but generally to secure\r\nthe most perfect drainage. A northern exposure is preferable for all\r\nvarieties adapted to the climate. To mature late varieties, choose a\r\nsouthern or eastern exposure.\r\n\r\n_Soil._--Gravelly, with a little sand, on a dry subsoil, is preferable,\r\nthough good grapes may be grown upon any land upon which water will not\r\nstand. Grapes always need much lime. If the vineyard is not located on\r\ncalcareous soil, lime must be liberally supplied, especially for\r\nwine-making. A dry subsoil, or thorough draining, is indispensable to\r\nsuccessful grape-culture. We prefer level land, wherever thorough\r\ndraining is practicable.\r\n\r\n_Propagation._--Choice grapes are propagated by grafts, layers, or\r\ncuttings. New ones are produced from seeds. The more kinds that are\r\ncultivated together, the greater will be the varieties raised from their\r\nseeds, by cross-fertilization in the blossoms. A small grape crossed\r\nwith a large one, or an early with a late one, or two of different\r\nflavors, will produce mediums between them. Seeds should be cleaned, and\r\nplanted in the fall, or kept in sand till spring. In the fall, cover up\r\nthe young vines. The second or third year, the young vines should be set\r\nin the places where they are designed to remain. By efforts to get new\r\nvarieties, we may adapt them to every latitude, from the gulf of Mexico\r\nto Pembina.\r\n\r\n_Layers._--These produce large vines and abundance of fruit earlier than\r\nany other method of propagation. Put down old wood in May or early June,\r\nand new wood a month later; fasten down with pegs having a hook to hold\r\nthe vine, and cover up with earth; they will take root freely at the\r\njoints, and may be removed in autumn or spring. If you put down wood too\r\nlate, or do not keep it covered with moist earth, it will fail;\r\notherwise it is always sure.\r\n\r\n_Cuttings_--may be from any wood you have to spare, and should be about\r\na foot long, having two buds. Plant at an angle of forty-five degrees,\r\none bud and two thirds of the cutting under the soil. A little shade and\r\nmoisture will cause nearly all to grow. A little grafting-wax on the top\r\nwill aid the growth, by preventing evaporation. The cutting, so buried\r\nas to have the top bud half an inch under fine mould, is said to be\r\nsurer. Cuttings should be made late in fall, or early in winter, and\r\npreserved as scions for grafting. Cuttings made in the spring are less\r\nsure to grow, and their removal is much more injurious to the vine.\r\nVines raised from cuttings may be transplanted when one or two years\r\nold.\r\n\r\n_Grafting_--should be performed after the leaves are well developed in\r\nthe spring. The sap becomes thick, which aids the process. Remove the\r\nearth, and saw off the vine two or three inches below the surface. Graft\r\nwith scions of the previous year's growth, but well matured, and apply\r\ncement, to keep the sap from coming out. Cover all but the top bud. In\r\nstocks an inch in diameter put two scions. Very few need fail.\r\n\r\n_Budding_--maybe done as in other cases, but always after the leaves are\r\nwell developed, to avoid bleeding. These modes of propagation stand in\r\nthe following order in point of preference, the best being named first:\r\nlayers, cuttings, grafting, budding.\r\n\r\n_Culture and Manure._--Land prepared by deep subsoil plowing, highly\r\nmanured and cultivated the previous season in a root-crop, is the best\r\nfor a vineyard. The trenches for the rows should be spaded twenty\r\ninches deep, and a part of the surface-soil put in the bottom. After\r\nplanting the vines, stir the ground often and keep clear of weeds. At\r\nfirst, stir the soil deep; but, as the roots extend, avoid working among\r\nthem, and never disturb the roots with a plow. Mulching preserves the\r\nsoil in a moist, loose condition, and is a good preventive of mildew. In\r\nmany instances it is said to have doubled the crop. Common\r\nanimal-manures are good for young vines, and in preparing the soil, but\r\nare rather too stimulating for bearing vines, often injuring the fruit.\r\nAshes and cinders from the smith's forge, wood-ashes, charcoal,\r\nsoapsuds, bones and bonedust, lime, and forest and grape leaves and\r\ntrimmings, carefully dug into the soil around the vines, are all very\r\ngood. A liberal supply of suitable manures will keep the vines in a\r\nhealthy condition, and preserve the fruit from disease and decay. This,\r\nwith judicious pruning, will render the grape-crop regular and sure.\r\n\r\n_Vineyards_--should be in rows five feet apart, with vines four feet\r\napart in the row. Layers of one, and cuttings of two years' growth, will\r\nbear the second year, and very plentifully the third year. A good\r\nvineyard in the latitude of Cincinnati yields about one hundred and\r\nfifty bushels of grapes per acre, making four hundred gallons of wine.\r\nThe average yield of wine per acre, throughout the country, is estimated\r\nat two hundred gallons.\r\n\r\n_Training under Glass._--By this means the fine foreign varieties may be\r\nbrought to perfection in our high latitudes. With most of the best\r\nkinds, this can be done by solar heat alone. A house covered with glass\r\nat an angle of forty-five degrees, facing the south, will answer the\r\npurpose. With a slight artificial heat, the finest varieties may be\r\nperfected, and others forwarded, so as to have fine grapes at most\r\nseasons of the year. The vines are planted on the outside of the\r\ngrapehouse, and allowed to pass in through an aperture two feet from the\r\nground, and are trained up near the glass on the inside. Protect the\r\nroots in winter by a covering of coarse straw manure. Wind the vines on\r\nthe inside with straw, lay them down on the ground in the grape-house,\r\nand keep it closed during the winter. A house one hundred feet long and\r\ntwenty-five feet wide, filled mainly with Black Hamburg, with a few\r\nother choice varieties, would afford a great luxury, and prove a\r\nprofitable investment. From one such house, near a large city, a careful\r\ncultivator may realize a thousand dollars per annum. Native and even\r\nhardy varieties are often greatly improved by cultivation under glass,\r\nor by a little protection in winter.\r\n\r\nThe Isabella grape is hardy and productive in western New York. In 1856,\r\nwe noticed a vine that had been laid down in a dry place and covered\r\nslightly with earth, in autumn; the fruit was more abundant, and one\r\nfourth larger, than that on a similar vine by its side that had remained\r\non the trellis during winter: this shows the value of protection even to\r\nhardy vines.\r\n\r\n_Training._--There are many methods, and the question of preference\r\ndepends upon the location of the vines, the space they may occupy, and\r\nthe taste of the cultivator. There are four principal systems--the cane\r\nor renewal system, spur system, fan-training, and spiral or hoop\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\nThe renewal system we prefer for trellises. Put posts firmly in the\r\nground eight feet apart, allowing them to be seven feet above ground\r\nafter they are set; put slats of wood or wire across these, a foot\r\napart, commencing a foot above the ground. Set vines eight feet apart;\r\nlet the vines be composed of two branches, coming out near the ground:\r\nthese can be formed by cutting off a young vine near the ground, and\r\ntraining two of the shoots that will spring from the bottom. These two\r\nvines should be bent down in opposite directions, and tied horizontally\r\nto the lower slat of the trellis; cut these off, so as to have them meet\r\nsimilar vines from the next root; upright shoots from these will extend\r\nto the top of the trellis, and it is then covered, and the work is\r\ncomplete. After these upright canes have borne, cut off every alternate\r\none, two or three inches from its base, and train up the strongest shoot\r\nfor a bearer next year: thus cut off and train new alternate ones every\r\nyear, and the vine will be constantly renewing, and be in the most\r\nproductive state; keep the vines clipped at the top of the trellis, and\r\nthe sap will mature strong buds for next year's fruit. We regard this\r\nthe most effectual of all training. The principle of renewal can be\r\napplied to any form of vine, and eminently promotes fruitfulness. Many\r\ncomplain that their vines, though liberally pruned, do not bear well.\r\nThe difficulty may be that the new wood is principally removed, while\r\nthe old is left to throw out strong-growing shoots, bearing abundance of\r\nfoliage and little fruit. More of the old wood removed, and more of the\r\nyoung saved, would have produced less vines and much more fruit.\r\n\r\n_Pruning_--is the most important part of successful grape-culture.\r\nMistakes on this subject are very injurious. Let vines grow in their own\r\nway, and you will have much wood and foliage, and very little, poor\r\nfruit. Some cut off the shoots in summer just above the fruit, and\r\nremove most of the leaves around it to expose the fruit to the sun. This\r\noften proves to be a ruinous mistake; the sap ascends to the leaves, and\r\nthere amalgamates with what they absorb from the atmosphere, and thus\r\nforms food for the vine and fruit. It is the leaves, and not the fruit,\r\nwhich need the sun: the leaves are the lungs, upon the action of which\r\nthe life and health of the fruit depend. Blight of the leaves destroys\r\nthe fruit, and a frequent repetition of it destroys the vine.\r\nGrape-vines should not be pruned at all until three years old, as it\r\nretards the growth of the roots, and thus weakens the vines. Older vines\r\nshould be freely pruned in November or December; pruned in winter they\r\n_may_ bleed in the spring, and pruned in the spring they _certainly_\r\nwill bleed. Tender vines, not protected, may have an excess of wood left\r\nin the fall to allow for what may perish in winter; in this case, cut\r\naway the dead and surplus wood in spring, but never until the leaves are\r\nwell developed, so as to prevent bleeding. Necessary summer-pruning is\r\nof much importance. Remove no leaves, except the ends of branches, that\r\nhave already made as much wood as they can mature. In the Middle states\r\nthis should be done about the last of July, and at the South a month\r\nearlier. Weak lateral branches, that bear no fruit, may be removed, but\r\nnot all of them, for it is on the wood of this year's growth that the\r\nfruit will be found the following season. Old wood does not send out\r\nwood in spring that will bear fruit the same season; that wood will bear\r\nfruit next season if allowed to remain. Whoever observes will notice\r\nthat grapes grow on young shoots of the same season; but they are\r\nshoots from wood of the previous year's growth, and not from old wood.\r\nMany suppose if they trim their vines very closely, as the old vines\r\nsend forth abundance of new wood, and it is new wood on which the fruit\r\ngrows, of course they will have abundance of grapes; and they are\r\ndisappointed by a failure. The explanation of the whole is, fruit grows\r\non new wood, from wood of previous year's growth, and not from old\r\nvines; hence, in lessening a vine, remove old wood. This is the renewal\r\nsystem, whatever the form of the vine, and is the whole secret of\r\nsuccessful pruning. This accounts for the great success of the Germans\r\nin producing such quantities of grapes on low vines. In their best\r\nvineyards, they do not allow their vines to grow more than six or seven\r\nfeet high, and yet they produce abundantly for many years. They so prune\r\nas to have plenty of last year's wood for the production of fruit the\r\ncurrent season; after this has borne fruit, they remove it to make room\r\nfor the young wood that will produce the next season. This principle is\r\napplicable to vines of any shape or size you may choose to form. The\r\nremoval, in summer, of excessive growth, and shortening the ends of\r\nthose you design to retain, throws the strength of the vine into the\r\nfruit, and to perfect the wood already formed. Liberal fall-pruning is\r\nnecessary to induce the formation of new wood the next season, for\r\nbearing the following year. Parts that grow late do not mature\r\nsufficiently to bear fruit the next season; hence, cut off the ends in\r\nsummer, and let what remains have the benefit of all the sap.\r\n\r\n_Reduction of Fruit._--The grape is disposed to excessive bearing, which\r\nweakens the vine, and injures the quality of the fruit. Liberal pruning\r\nin autumn does much to remedy this evil, by not leaving room for an\r\nexcessive amount of fruit: hence, when you have a plenty of\r\nfruit-bearing wood, cut off the ends, so as to leave spurs with two\r\nbuds, or at the most only four; when too much fruit sets, remove it very\r\nearly, before the juices of the vine have been wasted upon it. A vine\r\ncut or wounded in spring will bleed profusely. Sheet India-rubber, or\r\ntwo or three thicknesses of a bladder, wet and bound closely around, may\r\nprevent the bleeding.\r\n\r\n_Mildew_--is very destructive in confined locations, without a good\r\ncirculation of air. Sulphur and quicklime, separate or combined, dug\r\ninto the soil around the vines, is a preventive. Straw or litter of any\r\nkind, spread thick under the vines, is, perhaps, the best remedy--the\r\naction of it is in every way beneficial.\r\n\r\n_Insects._--The rosebug, spanworm, great greenworm, and many other\r\ninsects, infest grapevines, and do much injury. The large worms are most\r\neasily destroyed by hand; the small insects by flour-of-sulphur, or by\r\nsnuff, sprinkled over profusely when the vines are wet. The various\r\napplications recommended in this work for the destruction of insects,\r\nare useful on the grapevine. The principle is to apply something\r\noffensive to the insects, without being injurious to the vines.\r\n\r\n_Preserving Grapes._--Packed in sawdust or wheat-bran, always thoroughly\r\ndried by heat, they will keep well until spring. Another method is\r\npacking them in cotton-batting or wadding (the latter is best); or put\r\nthem in baskets holding no more than four or five quarts, cover tight\r\nwith cotton, and hang up in a cool, airy place, and they will long\r\nremain in good condition. In shallow boxes, six inches deep, put a sheet\r\nof wadding, and on it a layer of bunches of grapes, not allowed to\r\ntouch each other; on the top of the grapes put another sheet of cotton,\r\nand then another layer of grapes, and so the third, covering the last\r\nwith cotton, and put the cover on tight, and keep in a cool place. This\r\nis the most successful method.\r\n\r\nA new method is to suspend hoops by three cords, like a baby-jumper, and\r\nhang the bunches of grapes all around it, as near as possible without\r\ntouching, on little wire hooks, passing through the lower ends of the\r\nclusters, allowing the stem end to be suspended, and the grapes hang\r\naway from each other, and if the place be not damp enough to mould them,\r\nand not dry enough to cause them to shrivel, they keep exceedingly well.\r\nIt requires more care and judgment, than the other methods. A very cool\r\nsituation, without freezing, is essential in all cases. It is also\r\nnecessary to remove all broken or immature grapes, from the clusters you\r\nwould preserve.\r\n\r\n_Varieties_ are very numerous, and their nomenclature is confused, as\r\nthat of other fruits. It is utterly useless to cultivate foreign grapes\r\nin the open air in this country. They succeed very imperfectly, even in\r\nthe Southern states. But for cultivation under glass, they are\r\npreferable to any of our own. The following foreign grapes are preferred\r\nin this country:--\r\n\r\nBlack Prince, White Muscat, White Constantia, White Muscadine, White\r\nSweet-water, Early White Muscat, Black Cluster, Black Hamburg. The\r\nlatter is the best of all foreign grapes for cultivation under glass. It\r\nis very delicious, a great bearer, of very large clusters. It requires\r\nonly solar heat to bring it to perfection.\r\n\r\n_Native Grapes._--Of these we now have a large number, many of which are\r\nvaluable. We call attention only to a very few of the best. The\r\n_Isabella_ as a table luxury is hardly surpassed. In the Eastern,\r\nMiddle, and Western states, it is generally hardy and prolific. In\r\nnorthern Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, it does not ripen well. The\r\nseasons are too short. It also feels somewhat the severity of the\r\nweather, on the western prairies. It is also apt to decay at the South.\r\nFor all other parts it is one of the very best. It is an enormous\r\nbearer, one vine having been known to produce more than ten bushels, in\r\na single year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Isabella Grape.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Catawba Grape.]\r\n\r\nNext is the _Catawba_, better for wine, more vinous but not so sweet as\r\nthe Isabella, ripens two or three weeks later, and hence not so good in\r\nhigh latitudes.\r\n\r\n_The Rebecca Grape._--This is a comparatively new variety, of great\r\npromise. White like the Sweet-water, flavor very fine, vine hardy and\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\n_The Diana_ is a small delicious grape, excellent flavor for the\r\ndessert, and ripens two weeks earlier than the Isabella. Hence good for\r\nnorthern latitudes.\r\n\r\n_The Concord._--Large, showy, of good but not the best flavor, and\r\nripens with the Diana. Should be cultivated at the North.\r\n\r\n_The York Madeira_ is similar to the Isabella, smaller and a few days\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Rebecca Grape.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Delaware Grape.]\r\n\r\n_The Delaware_ is a small brown grape, excellent and hardy. Ripens quite\r\nas early as the Isabella. Best outdoor grape, in many localities.\r\n\r\n_The Canadian Chief._--One of the very best grapes for Canada.\r\n\r\n_Canby's August._--Very fine; considered better for the table than the\r\nIsabella, ripens ten days earlier, and as it is a good bearer, it should\r\nbe generally cultivated.\r\n\r\n_The Ohio Grape_ is a good variety, beginning to attract much notice.\r\n\r\n_The Scuppernong_ is the best of all grapes, for general cultivation at\r\nthe South. It is never affected by the rot. Not easily raised from\r\ncuttings. Layers are better. It does best trained on an arbor.\r\n\r\nThe soil and climate of the South are well adapted to the grape, even\r\nthe finer varieties that do not flourish well at the North. They are,\r\nhowever, seriously affected by the rot, an evil incident to the heat and\r\nhumidity of the climate. It being very warm, the dews and rains incline\r\nthe fruit to decay. We think the evil may be prevented by two very\r\nsimple means: Keep the vines very open, that they may dry very soon\r\nafter rain; and train them to trellises, from six to ten feet high, and\r\nover the top put a coping of boards, in the shape of a roof, extending\r\neighteen inches on each side of the trellis. It will prevent the rain\r\nand heavy dews from falling on the grapes, and is said to preserve them\r\nperfectly. This arrangement is about equal, in a warm climate, to cold\r\ngraperies at the north. We recommend increased attention to this great\r\nluxury, in all parts of the country. Seedlings will arise, adapted to\r\nevery locality on the continent.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRASSES.\r\n\r\nThere is a great number of varieties, adapted to cultivation in some\r\ncountries and climates, but not suitable for American culture. On the\r\ncomparative value of different grasses there is a diversity of opinions.\r\nThe best course for the practical farmer is, having the best and surest,\r\ntherewith to be content. Sir John Sinclair says there are two hundred\r\nand fifteen grasses cultivated in Great Britain. We shall notice a very\r\nfew of them, with a view to their comparative value:--\r\n\r\n1. _Sweet-scented Vernal Grass._--Small growth; yield of hay light. For\r\npastures it is very early, and grows quickly after being cropped, and is\r\nexcellent for milch-cows; grows well on almost any soil, but most\r\nnaturally on high, well-drained meadows. It grows in great abundance in\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\n2. _Meadow Foxtail._--Early like the preceding, but more productive and\r\nmore nutritious. It is one of the five or six kinds usually sown\r\ntogether in English pastures; best for sheep and horses.\r\n\r\n3. _Rough Cocksfoot._--_Orchard-grass_ of the United States; cows are\r\nfond of it. In England it is taking the place of clovers and rye-grass.\r\nAbout Philadelphia it is supplanting timothy. It is earlier, and\r\ntherefore better to mix with clover for hay, as they mature at the same\r\ntime; grows well in the shade, and on both loams and sands; springs\r\nrapidly after being cropped. Colonel Powell, one of the best American\r\nfarmers, says it produces more pasture than any other grass he has seen\r\nin this country. Two bushels of seed are sown on an acre.\r\n\r\n4. _Tall Oat-Grass._--A valuable grass, deserving increased attention.\r\nIt will produce three crops in a season; grows four or five feet high,\r\nand should be cut for hay when in blossom. Of all grasses, it is the\r\nearliest and best for green fodder.\r\n\r\n5. _Tall Fescue._--Cut in blossom, it contains more nutriment than any\r\nother known grass. Grows well by the sides of ditches, and is well\r\nadapted to wet bogs, as, by its rapid growth, it keeps down coarse,\r\nnoxious grass and weeds.\r\n\r\n6. _Rye Grass._--This is extensively cultivated in Scotland and in the\r\nnorth of England. It is mixed with clover. Respecting its comparative\r\nvalue there is a diversity of opinion. Some do not speak well of it.\r\n\r\n7. _Red Clover and White Clover._--See article \"Clover.\"\r\n\r\n8. _Lucern._--This yields much more green feed at a single crop than any\r\nother grass. For soiling cattle it is one of the best, and may be cut\r\ntwice as often as red clover. This makes a good crop, soon after time\r\nfor planting corn. Common corn or pop-corn, and later, Stowell's\r\nevergreen sweet corn, are the best for soiling cattle; but for early\r\nsoiling, use lucern, or some other quick-growing, large grass. Lucern\r\nneeds clean land, or cultivation at first, as young plants are tender.\r\nThe tap-root runs down very deep; hence, hard clay or wet soils are not\r\nfavorable. It stands the cold, in latitudes forty to forty-five degrees\r\nin this country, better than red clover.\r\n\r\n9. _Long-rooted Clover._--This is a Hungarian variety--biennial, but\r\nresows itself several years in succession, on good, clean land. Its\r\nyield of hay and seed is abundant. Needs a deep, dry soil, and stands a\r\ndrought better than any other grass. To plow in as a fertilizer, or for\r\nsoiling cattle, it is valuable, wherever it will flourish.\r\n\r\n10. _Sain-Foin._--Adapted to calcareous or chalky soils; considered one\r\nof the best plants ever introduced into England; but in New England it\r\nproves almost a failure--it requires more cool moisture and less frost.\r\n\r\n11. _Timothy._--In England, _Meadow Cats'-tail_, and in New England,\r\n_Herd's-grass_. This is the most valuable of all the grasses, and\r\nwherever it will thrive well, should never be superseded by anything\r\nelse for hay. It should be cut when the seed has begun to harden, but\r\nbefore it begins to shell, and never in the blossom. Let every farmer\r\nremember that timothy, cut in the seed, contains twice as much nutriment\r\nas when cut in the blossom; hence, it is not worth more than half as\r\nmuch for hay, sown among clover, as when sown by itself, as it must be\r\ncut too early, to avoid losing the clover.\r\n\r\n12. _Red Top._--We can not find this described in agricultural books;\r\nbut we have been familiar with it for thirty-five years, and can not\r\nfind a New York or New England farmer who does not know it well and\r\nprize it highly. For low, moist, rich meadows, the red top is the best\r\nfor hay of any known grass. It yields abundantly, and may be cut at any\r\ntime, from July to last of September. The hay is better for cattle than\r\ntimothy. Many intelligent gentlemen insist that it is the most healthy\r\nhay for horses.\r\n\r\nAfter all that has been written on the various grasses, we regard it\r\nbest for farmers throughout the continent to cultivate only the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\nFor early pastures, _vernal grass_ and _meadow foxtail_; pastures\r\nthrough the season, _white clover_, _cocks-foot_, _meadow foxtail_, _red\r\nclover_, and _timothy_; for lowland pastures, _red top_ and _tall\r\nfescue_; for hay, _timothy_, _red top_, _orchard grass_, and _tall\r\nfescue_; for the shade of fruit-trees, _orchard grass_; to be plowed in\r\nas fertilizers, _red clover_ and _white clover_, for soiling cattle,\r\n_tall oat-grass_ and _lucern_.\r\n\r\nTime of sowing grass-seed is important. Some prefer the fall, and others\r\nthe spring. Fall sowing should be very early or very late. Early sowing\r\nwill give the young plants strength to endure the frosts of winter,\r\nwhich would kill late sown; but sow so late that it will not vegetate\r\nuntil spring, and it will come up early and get out of the way of the\r\ndroughts of summer. Grass-seed sown late in the spring will always fail,\r\nexcept when followed by a very wet season. Sow timothy with fall grain,\r\nor late in the fall, or on a light snow toward the close of winter. Do\r\nnot sow clover in the fall, as the young plants will generally fail in\r\nthe cold winter;--sow it on the last light snow of winter, and it will\r\nalways succeed. Roll the land in spring on which you have sown\r\ngrass-seed in the last of winter; it will benefit the grain, and cause\r\nthe grass-seed to catch well, and get an earlier and more rapid growth.\r\nLet all who would not lose their seed and labor, remember that\r\ngrass-seed not sown so as to form good roots, before the frosts of\r\nwinter or the drought of summer, will be lost; the plants will be\r\nkilled. Timothy-seed sown in the fall, one peck to the acre, will\r\nproduce a good crop the next season.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENHOUSE.\r\n\r\nGreenhouses vary as much in style and cost as dwellings. The simplest is\r\nany tight enclosure, covered with a glass roof at an angle of forty-five\r\ndegrees, facing the south, and kept warm by artificial heat. The\r\ntemperature is not allowed to be lower than forty nor higher than\r\nseventy degrees of Fahrenheit; this will keep plants growing and make\r\nthem blossom, and affords a good place for starting plants to be\r\ntransplanted to out-door hotbeds, and finally to the vegetable garden,\r\nafter frosts are over. There is but one main danger in greenhouse\r\nculture, and that is obviated by a little care: it is, allowing the air\r\nto become too much heated for the health of the plants; they require but\r\nlittle heat, but need it regularly. Some greenhouses are warmed by\r\nstoves, and serve a good purpose; others have a stove set in a flue\r\nwhich is built in the wall, gradually rising until it has passed around\r\ntwo or three sides of the building. Place three or four sheet-iron pans\r\nover this flue, at different points, and keep them filled with water;\r\nthe fire in the flue will heat the water, and impart both warmth and\r\nhumidity to the atmosphere, which is very favorable to the health and\r\ngrowth of plants. Such a house is favorable to the growth of tender\r\nexotic fruits and plants. A similar house without any artificial heat\r\naffords an excellent place for the cultivation of the finest varieties\r\nof foreign grapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGYPSUM, OR PLASTER OF PARIS.\r\n\r\nThe fertilizing properties of this article were discovered by a German\r\nlaborer in a quarry, who observed the increased luxuriance of the grass\r\nby his path, when the dust fell from his shoes and clothes. This led to\r\nexperiments which demonstrated its fertilizing power. With the\r\nprotracted controversies on gypsum we have nothing to do; certain\r\nimportant facts are established which are valuable to agriculturists.\r\n\r\nGypsum is valuable as an application to the soil, at from three fourths\r\nto one and a quarter bushels to the acre. On poor land, for a flax crop\r\nthree bushels per acre, applied after the plants were up, and when wet,\r\nproduced a great crop. It should be applied only once in two years, or\r\nin very small quantities every year. Applied as a top-dressing, it will\r\ndo no good until a considerable quantity of rain has fallen upon it. If\r\nit be applied in the spring, and the summer prove a dry one, its\r\ngreatest effect will be felt the next season. Its most marked effects\r\nare on poor soils; on land already rich it seems to produce but little\r\neffect; on dry, sandy or gravelly soils, it will increase a clover crop\r\nfrom one fourth to two thirds; sowed among clover and immediately plowed\r\nin, it acts powerfully. Plants of large leaves feel its influence much\r\nmore than those with small ones, hence its excellence on clover,\r\npotatoes, and vines. Some soils contain enough plaster already: the\r\nfarmer must determine by analysis or experiment. On the compost heap it\r\nis valuable in small quantities; it is also useful on all long, coarse,\r\nor fresh manures of the previous winter. Seeds rolled in it before\r\nplanting vegetate sooner and stronger. Mixed with an equal quantity of\r\nashes and a little lime, and applied to any crop immediately after\r\nhoeing, or when just coming up, it adds materially to its growth. It is\r\nbetter to apply it twice--on first coming up, and immediately after\r\nfirst hoeing; small quantities are best;--it will ten times repay the\r\ncost and labor. Upland pastures and meadows, except clay soils, are\r\ngreatly benefited by it. A time-saving method of sowing plaster on\r\nfields of grass or grain, is to sow out of a wagon driven slowly through\r\nthe field, the driver being guided by his former tracks, while two men\r\nsow out of the wagon. It is customary to put plaster and ashes, mixed,\r\naround the hills of corn, or throw it upon the plants. Sown on the field\r\nof hoed or hill crops, its effects are much greater than when only put\r\non the hill. It should be sown equally over the whole ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARROWING.\r\n\r\nThe very liberal use of the harrow is one of the principal requisites of\r\nsuccessful farming. No other single tool does so much to pulverize the\r\nsoil, as the harrow. A full crop can only be raised on a fine mellow\r\nsoil. Seeds planted in soil left coarse and uneven, will vegetate\r\nunevenly, grow unequally, ripen at different times, and produce unequal\r\nquantities. Many farmers insist that it is a mere notion, without\r\nreason, to harrow land four or five times, and roll it once or twice.\r\nNot one in five hundred believes in the full utility of such a thorough\r\nworking of the soil. Coarse lumpy soils expose the seeds and roots of\r\nyoung plants to drought, and to too strong action of the atmosphere.\r\n(See article on _Rolling_.)\r\n\r\nHarrow sandy and sod land whenever you please. If you work any other\r\nsoil when very wet, it will not recover from the effects of it during\r\nthe whole season. Harrow land the first time the same way it was plowed.\r\n\r\nThe form of a harrow is of no importance, except avoiding the butterfly\r\ndrag, that seldom works well. The square harrow with thirty teeth is\r\nusually preferred. Every farmer should have a =V= drag also.\r\n\r\nCorn, potatoes, peas, and other crops that are planted in straight rows,\r\nshould be harrowed just after coming up, with a =V= drag, drawn by two\r\nhorses. The front teeth should be taken out that the row may pass\r\nbetween the teeth, as well as between the horses.\r\n\r\nSuch a cultivation will do more good than any other single subsequent\r\none. It stirs the whole surface, pulverizing the soil, keeps it mellow\r\nand moist, and destroys the weeds, and all at the best possible time,\r\nfor the benefit of the crop. No other form of cultivation is so good for\r\na young crop. Try two acres, one in the usual way, and the other by\r\nharrowing, as we recommend, when it first comes up, and you will never\r\nafter neglect harrowing all your hoed crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAY.\r\n\r\nFarmers differ in their modes of making and preserving hay. The\r\nfollowing directions for timothy and clover, are applicable to all\r\ngrasses suitable for hay, as they are all divided into two classes,\r\nbroad-leaved, and the fine-leaved, or grasses proper. The principles\r\ninvolved in these directions may be considered comparatively well\r\nsettled, and they are sufficient for all purposes. Cut clover when half\r\nthe blossoms are dried, and the other half in full bloom. Cut later, the\r\nstalks are so dried, that they are of much less value. Cut earlier, it\r\nis so immature, as to be of small value for hay. In case of great growth\r\nand lodging down, clover may be cut earlier, as it is better to save hay\r\nof less value, than to lose the whole. To cure clover for hay, spread it\r\nevenly, immediately after the scythe, let it thoroughly wilt, but not\r\ndry. Rake it up, before any of the leaves are dry so as to break, and\r\nput it in small cocks, such as a man can pitch upon a cart at once or\r\ntwice with a fork. This should be _laid_ on and not _rolled_ up from a\r\nwinrow. In the former case it will shed nearly all the water, and the\r\nlatter method suffers the rain to run down through the whole.\r\n\r\nUnless the weather be very wet, clover will cure in this way, without\r\nopening until time to haul it in, and will retain its beautiful green\r\ncolor, almost equal to that of England and Germany, cured in the shade,\r\nwhich, at two or three years old, appears almost as bright as though not\r\ncured at all. If the weather be quite wet, cut clover when free from dew\r\nor rain, wilt it at once, and draw it in, put as much as possible in\r\nthin layers on scaffolds, and under cover, to cure in the shade. Put the\r\nremainder in alternate layers with equal quantities of dry straw, with\r\none peck of salt to a ton. A ton may bear half a bushel of salt, less is\r\nbetter, and more is injurious to stock, by compelling them to eat too\r\nmuch salt. The most beautiful and palatable clover hay is that cured in\r\nthe shade, on scaffolds and afterward mowed away.\r\n\r\nTimothy should never be cut, until the seed is far enough advanced to\r\ngrow. Careful experiments have shown that cut in the blossom, the hay\r\nwill contain only about one half as much nutriment, as when cut in the\r\nfull-grown seed, but before it commences shelling. Cure as clover, but\r\nin twice as large cocks, and never salt, unless compelled to draw in\r\nwhen damp or too green.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEDGE.\r\n\r\nThe question of fencing in this country, so much of which is prairie,\r\nand in other parts of which there is such a wanton waste of timber,\r\ngives great importance to successful hedging. The same plants are not\r\nequally good for hedge in all parts of the country. There are but few\r\nplants suitable for hedges in our climate.\r\n\r\n_The Osage Orange_--is the best, in all latitudes where it will\r\nflourish. It has no diseases or enemies by which it will be destroyed,\r\nexcept too cold winters. Of Southern origin, yet it flourishes in many\r\nplaces at the North. In cold localities, where there is but little snow,\r\nit suffers much until three or four years old. It is being extensively\r\nintroduced into central and northern Illinois, where unusually cold\r\nwinters destroy vast quantities of young plants, and kill the tops of\r\nmuch old hedge. It is still insisted that it will succeed; but we\r\nconsider it too uncertain, and consequently too expensive, for general\r\nfencing in such climates. The roots and lower parts of the plants may be\r\npreserved, however, by setting them out for a hedge on level ground,\r\ninstead of ridges as usual, and plowing a furrow three feet from each\r\nside of the row, to drain off surplus water. Mulch thoroughly in the\r\nfall, and thus protect from frost until they have been set in the hedge\r\nfor three years, and they may succeed and make a good live fence. To\r\nraise the plants, soak the seeds thoroughly, and, at the usual time of\r\ncorn-planting, plant in straight rows, and keep clean of weeds. Set out\r\nin hedge the following spring. The soil of the hedge-row should be deep,\r\nmellow, and moderately, not excessively rich. Too rich soil makes a\r\nlarger growth, of spongy and more tender wood. Plants should have a\r\nportion of the tap-root cut off, and be planted a foot apart in the row.\r\n\r\n_The Hawthorn_--will never be extensively cultivated for live fence in\r\nthis country, being subject to borers, as destructive as in fruit-trees.\r\n\r\n_The Virginia Thorn_--is equally uncertain.\r\n\r\n_The Buck Thorn_--after fifteen years' trial, in New England, bids fair\r\nto answer every purpose for American live fence: it is easily\r\npropagated, of rapid growth, very hardy, thickens up well at the bottom,\r\nand is exempt from the depredations of insects. It may yet prove the\r\ngreat American hedge-shrub.\r\n\r\n_The Newcastle Thorn_--cultivated in New England, is much more\r\nbeautiful, and promises to rival the buck thorn, but has not been\r\nsufficiently tested to settle its claims. Much is anticipated from it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shearing down young hedges.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Properly-trimmed hedge (end view).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Badly-trimmed hedge (end view).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Neglected hedge (side view).]\r\n\r\nThere are plants well adapted to hedge at the South, which are too\r\ntender for the North. In White's Gardening for the South, we have the\r\nfollowing given as hedge-shrubs, adapted to that region: Osage Orange,\r\nPyracanth, Cherokee, and single White Macartney roses. The Macartney,\r\nbeing an evergreen thorn, and said to make as close a hedge as the Osage\r\nOrange and much more beautiful, is quite a favorite at the South. They\r\nusually train the rose-shrubs for hedge on some kind of paling or wire\r\nfence. They render some of them impenetrable even by rabbits or\r\nsparrows; this is done by layers, and trimming twice a year, commencing\r\nafter the first three months' growth. Pruning is the most important\r\nmatter in the whole business of hedging. A hedge set out ever so well,\r\nand composed of the best variety of plants, if left in the weeds,\r\nwithout proper care in trimming, will be nearly useless. A well-trimmed\r\nhedge around a fruit-orchard will keep out all fruit-thieves. The great\r\ndifficulty is the _unwillingness_ of cultivators to cut off, so short\r\nand so frequently, _the fine growth_.\r\n\r\nShear off the first year's growth (_a_) within three inches of the\r\nground (_b_). Cut the vigorous shoots that will rise from this shearing,\r\nfour inches higher, about the middle of July, and similar and successive\r\ncuttings, each a little longer, in the two following years; these will\r\nbring the hedge to a proper height. The form of trimming shown in end\r\nview of properly-trimmed hedge, protects the bottom from shade by too\r\nmuch foliage on the top: the effects of that shade are seen in neglected\r\nhedge in the cut.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMP.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the staple articles of American agriculture. It is much\r\ncultivated in Kentucky and other contiguous states. Its market value is\r\nso fluctuating that many farmers are giving up its cultivation. The\r\nsubstance of these directions is taken from an elaborate article from\r\nthe pen of the honorable Henry Clay. Had not the length of that article\r\nrendered it inconsistent with the plan of this volume, we should have\r\ngiven it to the American people as it came from the hand of their\r\ngreatest statesman, who was so eminently American in all his sentiments\r\nand labors.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Soil_--should be as thorough as for flax;--this can\r\nnot be too strongly insisted on. Much is lost by neglect, under the\r\nmistaken notion that hemp will do about as well on coarse, hard land.\r\nPlants for seeds should be sown in drills four feet apart, and separate\r\nfrom that designed only for the lint. The stalks should be allowed to\r\nstand about eight inches apart in the rows. Plants are male and female,\r\ndistinguished in the blossoms. When the farina from the blossoms on the\r\nmale plants (the female plants do not blossom) has generally fallen,\r\npull up the male plants, leaving only the females to mature. Cut the\r\nseed-plants after the first hard frost, and carry in wet, so as to avoid\r\nloss by shelling. Seed is easily separated by a common flail. After the\r\nseeds are thrashed out, they should be spread thin, and thoroughly\r\ndried, or their vegetative power will be destroyed by heat or decay.\r\nThey should be spread to be kept for the next spring's planting, and not\r\nbe kept in large bulk. Their vegetation is very uncertain after they are\r\na year old. Sow hemp for lint broadcast, when the weather has become\r\nwarm enough for corn-planting. Opinions vary as to the quantity of seed,\r\nfrom one bushel to two and a half bushels per acre. Probably a bushel\r\nand a peck is best. Plowing in the seed is good on old land; rolling is\r\nalso useful. If it gets up six inches high, so that the leaves cover the\r\nground well, few crops are less effected by the vicissitudes of the\r\nweather. Some sow a part of their hemp at different times, that it may\r\nnot all ripen at once and crowd them in their labor. Cutting it ten days\r\nbefore it is ripe, or allowing it to stand two weeks after, will not\r\nmaterially injure it. Hemp is pulled or cut. Cutting, as near the ground\r\nas possible, is the better method. The plants are spread even on the\r\nground and cured; bound up in convenient handfuls and shocked up, and\r\nbound around the top as corn. It is an improvement to shake off the\r\nleaves well before shocking up. If stacked after a while, and allowed to\r\nremain for a year, the improvement in the lint is worth more than the\r\nloss of time. There are two methods of rotting--dew-rotting,\r\n=and= water-rotting--one by spreading out on grass-land, and the other by\r\nimmersing in water; the latter is much the preferable mode. The question\r\nof sufficient rotting is determined by trial. Hemp is broken and cleaned\r\nlike flax. The stalks need to be well aired and dried in the sun to\r\nfacilitate the operation. Extremes in price have been from three to\r\neight dollars per hundred pounds: five dollars renders it a very\r\nprofitable crop. Thorough rotting, good cleaning, and neat order, are\r\nthe conditions of obtaining the first market price. An acre produces\r\nfrom six hundred to one thousand pounds of lint--an average of about one\r\nhundred pounds to each foot of height of the stalks. Hemp exhausts the\r\nsoil but a mere trifle, if at all; the seventeenth successive crop on\r\nthe same land having proved the best. Nothing leaves the land in better\r\ncondition for other crops; it kills all the weeds, and leaves the\r\nsurface smooth and even.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOEING.\r\n\r\nMuch depends upon the proper and timely use of the hoe. Never let weeds\r\npress you; hoe at proper times, and you never will have any large weeds.\r\nAs soon as vegetables are up, so that you can do it safely, hoe them.\r\nThe more frequent the hoeing while plants are young, the larger will be\r\nthe crop. Premium crops are always hoed very frequently. Hoeing\r\ncabbages, corn, and similar smooth plants, when it rains slightly, is\r\nnearly equal to a coat of manure. But beans, potatoes, and vines, and\r\nwhatever has a rough stalk, are much injured by stirring the ground\r\nabout them while they are wet, or even much damp. We have known\r\npromising crops of vines nearly destroyed by hoeing when wet. Hoeing\r\nnear the roots of vines after they have formed runners one or two feet\r\nlong, will also nearly ruin them;--the same is true of onions: hoe near\r\nthem, cutting off the lateral roots, and you will lessen the crop one\r\nhalf. In hoeing, make no high hills except for sweet potatoes. High\r\nhilling up originated in England, where their cool, humid, cloudy\r\natmosphere demands it, to secure more warmth. In this country we have to\r\nguard more against drought and heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPS.\r\n\r\nThese are native in this country, being found, growing spontaneously, by\r\nmany of our rivers. There are four or five varieties, but no preference\r\nhas been given to any particular one. Moist, sandy loam is the best\r\nsoil, though good hops may be grown in abundance on any land suitable\r\nfor corn or potatoes. Plow the land quite deep in autumn; in the spring,\r\nharrow the same way it was plowed. Spread evenly over the surface\r\nsixteen cords of manure to the acre, if your soil be of ordinary\r\nrichness; cross-plow as deep as the first plowing; furrow out as for\r\npotatoes, four feet apart each way. Plant hops in every other hill of\r\nevery other row, making them eight feet apart each way. Plant all the\r\nremaining hills with potatoes. Four cuttings of running roots of hops\r\nshould be planted in each hill. Many hop-yards are unproductive on\r\naccount of being too thick;--less than eight feet each way deprives the\r\nvines of suitable air and sun, and prevents plowing them with ease. The\r\nfirst year, they only need to be kept clean of weeds by hoeing them with\r\nthe potatoes. In the fall of the first year, to prevent injury from hard\r\nfrosts, put a large shovelful of good manure on the top of each hill.\r\nEach spring, before the hops are opened, spread on each acre eight cords\r\nof manure; coarse straw manure is preferable. Plow both ways at first\r\nhoeing. They require three hoeings, the last when in full bloom in the\r\nbeginning of August. Open the hops every spring by the middle of May; at\r\nthe South, by the last of April. This is done by making four furrows\r\nbetween the rows, turning them from the hills; the earth is then removed\r\nfrom the roots with a hoe, and all the running roots cut in with a sharp\r\nknife within two inches of the main roots. The tops of the main roots\r\nmust also be cut in, and covered with earth two inches deep. Set the\r\npoles on the first springing of the vines; never have more than two\r\npoles in a hill, or more than two vines on a pole, and no pole more than\r\nsixteen feet high. Neglect this root-pruning, and multiply poles and\r\ncrowd them with vines, and you will get very few hops. Select the most\r\nthrifty vines for the poles, and destroy all the others. Watch them\r\nduring the summer, that they do not blow down from the poles. They must\r\nbe picked as soon as they are ripe, and before frosts. The best\r\npicking-box is a wooden bin made of light boards, nine feet long, three\r\nfeet wide, and two and a half feet deep; the poles are laid across this,\r\nand the hops picked into it by hand. In gathering hops, cut the vines\r\ntwo feet from the ground, that bleeding may not injure the roots.\r\n\r\n_Curing_ is the most important matter in hop-growing. Hops would all be\r\nof one quality, and bring the first price, if equally well cured. The\r\nfollowing description (with slight abbreviation) of the process of\r\ncuring, by William Blanchard, Esq., is, perhaps, as complete as anything\r\nthat can be obtained. Much depends upon having a well-constructed kiln.\r\nFor the convenience of putting the hops on the kiln, a side hill is\r\ngenerally chosen for its situation; it should be a dry situation. It\r\nshould be dug out the same bigness at the bottom as at the top; the side\r\nwalls laid up perpendicularly, and filled in solid with stone to give it\r\na tunnel form: twelve feet square at the top, two feet square at the\r\nbottom, and at least eight feet deep, is deemed a convenient size. On\r\nthe top of the walls sills are laid, having joists let into them, as for\r\nlaying a floor, on which laths, about one and a half inches wide, are\r\nnailed, leaving open spaces between them three fourths of an inch, over\r\nwhich a thin linen cloth is spread and nailed at the edges to the sills.\r\nA board about twelve inches wide is set up on each side of the kiln, on\r\nthe inner edge of the sill, to form a bin to receive the hops. Fifty\r\npounds, after they are dry, is all such a kiln will hold at once. The\r\nlarger the stones made use of in the construction of the kiln the\r\nbetter, as it will give a more steady and dense heat. The inside of the\r\nkiln should be well plastered with mortar to make it air-tight. Charcoal\r\nis the best fuel. Heat the kiln well before putting on the hops; keep a\r\nsteady and regular heat while drying. Hops must not remain in bulk long\r\nafter being picked, as they will heat and spoil. Do not stir them while\r\ndrying. After they are thoroughly dry, remove them into a dry room, and\r\nlay in heaps, and not stir unless they are gathering dampness that will\r\nchange their color; then spread them. This will only occur when they\r\nhave not been properly dried. They are bagged by laying cloth into a\r\nbox, so made that it can be removed, and give opportunity to sew up the\r\nbag while in the press. The hops are pressed in by a screw. In bulk they\r\nwill sweat a little, which will begin to subside in about eight days, at\r\nwhich time they should be bagged. If they sweat much and begin to change\r\ntheir color, they must be dried before bagging. The best size for bags\r\nis about two hundred and fifty pounds' weight, in a bag about five feet\r\nlong. Common tow-cloth or Russia-hemp bags are best. Extensive\r\nhop-growers build houses over the kiln, that they may be able to use\r\nthem in wet weather. In this case, keep the doors open as much as\r\npossible without letting in the rain. Dried without sufficient air,\r\ntheir color is changed, and their quality and market-value injured.\r\nThese houses are made much larger than the kiln, in many instances, for\r\nthe convenience of storing and bagging the hops when dry; in this case,\r\ntight partitions should separate the storerooms from the kiln, to avoid\r\ndampness from the drying hops.\r\n\r\nThe form of manuring recommended is contrary to the old practice of\r\nputting a little manure only in the hill: that practice exposed vines to\r\ndecay and destruction by worms, and this does not; our system also\r\nproduces hops equal to new land.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSE.\r\n\r\nThis noble animal is in general use, and everywhere highly prized. By\r\nthe last census, we see that there are two thirds as many horses as cows\r\nin the United States--4,335,358 horses, and over six millions of cows.\r\nBut, valuable as is the horse, he suffers much ill treatment and neglect\r\nfrom his master. To give a history of the horse, the various breeds of\r\ndifferent countries, and the efforts to improve them, would be\r\ninteresting, did it fall within the limits of our design. The patronage\r\nof the kings and nobility of England has done much to elevate the horse\r\nto his present standard of excellence. It has now become the custom for\r\nintelligent gentlemen in rural districts, in all enlightened countries,\r\nto give much attention to the improvement of horses. Unfortunately, some\r\nof that enthusiasm is perverted to the channel of horse-racing, a\r\npractice alike injurious to horses and the morals of men. A few brief\r\nhints are all we have space for, where a volume would be interesting and\r\nuseful. The farmer should exercise constant care to improve the breed of\r\nhis horses: it pays best to raise good horses. This depends upon the\r\nqualities of the dam and sire, and upon proper feed and care. This is a\r\nsubject that farmers should carefully study from books and from their\r\nown observation. The most important matter in raising horses, is care in\r\nworking and feeding. Nineteen out of twenty of all sick horses are made\r\nso by bad treatment. The prevention of disease is better than cure.\r\nSteady, and even hard work, will not injure a horse that is well and\r\nregularly fed. But a few moments of crowding a horse's speed, or of an\r\nunnatural strain on his strength, may ruin him. Let it always be\r\nremembered that it is speed, and not heavy loads, that most injures a\r\nhorse. A mile an hour too fast will soon run down your horse. A horse\r\nfed with grain, or watered, when warm, is liable to be foundered; and if\r\nnot so fed as actually to be foundered, he will gradually grow stiff.\r\nHorses are liable to take cold by any unreasonable exposure to the\r\nweather, in the same circumstances as men, and the effects on health and\r\ncomfort are very similar. A horse having become warm by driving, should\r\nnever stand a minute without a blanket. When a man goes from a heated\r\nroom, or in a perspiration, into inclement weather, he takes cold the\r\nmoment the cold or storm strikes him: in a few moments the effects on\r\nthe pores of the body are such that there is no particular exposure. It\r\nis so with a horse. He takes cold when you are only going to allow him\r\nto \"stand but a minute,\" and during that time you leave him uncovered.\r\n\r\nIf you are under the necessity of doing an unusual day's work with a\r\nhorse, do not feed him heavily on that day. Unusual feed the day before\r\nand the day after will do him good; but on the day of excessive work it\r\ninjures him. Never feed horses too much; they will often eat one third\r\nmore than is good for their health. Keep the bottom of the trough in\r\nwhich you feed your horses grain, plastered over with a mixture of equal\r\nparts of salt and ashes, that they may eat a little of it when they\r\nplease. When the water of your horse becomes thick and yellowish, or\r\nwhitish, give him a piece of rosin as large as a walnut, pulverized and\r\nput in his grain. If a horse has the heaves, give him no hay or oats;\r\ncorn, ground or soaked, should be his only grain, and green corn-fodder\r\nin summer, and cornstalks, cut fine, with a little warm water on them,\r\nmixed with meal, should constitute his only food. All except a few of\r\nthe most confirmed and long-standing cases of heaves are _entirely\r\nrelieved_ by this course of feeding, and that relief is permanent as\r\nlong as the feed is continued, and it frequently effects a cure so\r\nradical that the disease will not return on a change of food. To bring\r\nup horses that have had hard usage and poor feed, and to secure growth\r\nin colts, feed them milk. The milk of a butter-dairy is not more\r\nprofitably used in any other way, than fed to horses and colts. Give\r\nthem no water for two or three days, and they will readily learn to\r\ndrink all the sour, thick milk you will give them. Colts will grow\r\nfaster on milk than on any other food.\r\n\r\nHorses should be often rubbed down and kept clean, and when put in the\r\nstable wet, they should be rubbed dry. It is very essential to the\r\nhealth of a horse that he have pure air. Stables in this country are\r\nusually airy enough. But if the stable be tight, it should be well\r\nventilated. The gases from a wet stable floor are injurious.\r\nDisinfecting agents are good remedies; a little plaster-of-Paris spread\r\nover a stable-floor is very useful. These brief directions, followed,\r\nwill prevent most of the diseases to which horses are subject; or in\r\ncase a horse be attacked, he will have the disease lightly, as temperate\r\nmen do epidemics.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSERADISH.\r\n\r\nThis is regarded a healthy condiment, especially in the spring of the\r\nyear. Grated, with a little vinegar, it may be eaten with any food you\r\nchoose. Small shavings of the root are esteemed in mangoes. When steeped\r\nin vinegar for two weeks, it is said effectually to remove freckles from\r\nthe face. Any pieces of the roots will grow in any good garden-soil.\r\nLarger and better roots may be produced, by trenching the bed two feet\r\ndeep, and putting in the bottom, ten inches of good manure, and planting\r\nselected roots, about six inches deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOTBEDS.\r\n\r\nThese are designed to force an early growth of plants. It is done by the\r\nuse of solar heat, and that arising from fermenting manures, combined.\r\nThe following directions for constructing and managing hotbeds will\r\nenable every one to be successful. Nail boards on pieces of scantling\r\nplaced in the inside corners, in the form of a box, sixteen feet long\r\nand six feet wide; make it three and a half feet high on the back-side,\r\nand two feet high in front, facing the sun; nail a piece of board across\r\nthe middle, let in at the top, to prevent the box from spreading when\r\nfilled. Fill that with good, fresh horse-manure, with but little straw;\r\ntread it down firmly. Put over the whole, sashes made with cross-pieces\r\nbut one way, and filled with glass, lapped half an inch, like shingles\r\non a roof, to carry off the rain; putty in the glass lightly, or it may\r\nadhere to fresh-painted frames; let the frames be halved on their edges,\r\nso as to lap and be tight; put these over the filled hotbed, perfectly\r\nfitted all around, and enough of them to cover the whole bed; in two or\r\nthree days the manure will become pretty warm, when it should be\r\ncovered, four inches deep, with rich mould, sheltered for the purpose\r\nthe previous fall, and the seeds planted. When the plants come up, see\r\nthat they are kept sufficiently moist, and not have the hot sun pour\r\nupon them intensely, and they will grow rapidly; when too warm, they\r\nshould be partly covered with mats, and the frames raised to let in air.\r\nPut small wedges between the sash and the boards, which will let in\r\nsufficient air. Keep it closed when the air is cold, and covered with\r\nmats when the sun is too hot. Plants are often destroyed by\r\nover-heating. When in danger of freezing, cover closely with mats or\r\nstraw, or both. We have had plants growing in such a bed when the\r\nthermometer stood eight degrees below zero. If the heat of the manure\r\nsubsides too early, pack fresh horse-manure all around the outside of\r\nthe box, and as it heats it will communicate warmth to the inside of the\r\nbed. As plants grow up, transplant a part to a fresh bed, so as to give\r\nall a chance to grow stocky and strong. Almost everything that grows in\r\nthe garden may be forwarded greatly in the hotbed. Vines, beets,\r\ntomatoes, cabbages, peppers, egg-plants, celery, beans, corn, and\r\npotatoes, may be obtained much earlier by this means. Those that are\r\ninjured most by transplanting should be planted in the hotbed, on\r\ninverted sods, or grass turfs, six inches square, which can be removed\r\nwith the growing plants on them, without seriously disturbing the\r\nroots. Plenty of shade and moisture on transplanting will save the most\r\ntender plants, and they will speedily recover. Make a hotbed of any size\r\nyou may desire on the same principle. The boards and frames will last\r\nmany years, with proper care, and occasional supply of a broken light of\r\nglass. Into such sash, broken glass of any size can be put, by cutting\r\nit to a proper width in one direction, no matter how far the points lap.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSES.\r\n\r\nIt is not our design to give an extended view of rural architecture. But\r\nthis work can not be complete without a brief notice of farm-buildings,\r\nand a few plans for such buildings, adapted to the wants of those\r\npossessing limited means. We hope these directions and plans will prove\r\nimportant aids in getting up cheap, yet convenient and beautiful,\r\ncountry residences, especially in all the newer parts of the country.\r\nOur reading on rural architecture, and an extensive observation in many\r\nstates of the Union, have made us acquainted with nothing, combining\r\nbeauty, cheapness, and utility, better than the following.\r\n\r\nThe scale at the bottom will enable any mechanic to determine the size\r\nof each of these buildings, and their relation to each other. They can,\r\non the same general plan, be made of any dimensions, to suit the wishes\r\nof the proprietor.\r\n\r\nThe wagon-house in the range is forty feet long, affording ample shelter\r\nfor all kinds of vehicles, connected by a covered way with the\r\nhorse-stables and barn-floor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Range of Farm-Buildings.]\r\n\r\nA lean-to is built on the north side of the wagon-house, in which is a\r\ntool-house opening into it, and a stable for eight milch-cows, that will\r\nthus be convenient for winter-milking; these cows are fed from the loft\r\nover the wagon-house. The barn is thirty by forty feet, with floor in\r\nthe middle and bay on each side: this can be driven into on one side and\r\nout on the other. From the floor is a covered way to cattle and horse\r\nstables, and into the wagon and tool house, without going outdoor.\r\n\r\n_The Piggery._--Large and small swine do not do so well together; hence,\r\nthe larger ones are to occupy the feeding-pen and bed on the right (in\r\nthe cut), those of medium size on the left, and the smaller ones in the\r\nrear. The dimensions and relative size of apartments can be determined\r\nfrom the plan.\r\n\r\nThe other buildings sufficiently explain themselves in the cut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ground-plan of Piggery.]\r\n\r\nWith this range of buildings, let a farmer do his own thrashing, with a\r\nsmall horse-power, and thrash a part at a time during the winter,\r\nkeeping the straw in an apartment in the bay, dry for litter, and for\r\ncut feed for cattle and horses, and it will be the best and most\r\neconomical method of thrashing and keeping stock. Every farmer should do\r\nat least a part of his thrashing in this way, during the winter, for the\r\nbenefit of fresh straw, &c.\r\n\r\n_Country Residence._--This includes the range of buildings given\r\nopposite, their distance from the house, and all the parts of a complete\r\nresidence, with all the comforts and conveniences that can be crowded\r\ninto such a space, and at a very reasonable expense. Three fourths of an\r\nacre are devoted to the ornamental grounds; except the walks and small\r\nflower-beds, it is all green turf. Plowed very deep and thoroughly\r\nenriched, the trees are set out, and all then made very level, and one\r\nand a half bushels grass-seed sown on it and brushed in very smooth.\r\nThis soon makes a very thick green turf, to be cut every ten days during\r\nthe most growing season, and less frequently as the season advances. The\r\ntrees, for a few years, need careful working around and mulching. The\r\ngravel carriage-road is twelve feet wide, and winding around shrubbery,\r\nit leads to the carriage-house in the range of buildings. The foot-walks\r\nare five feet wide. The curves in the walks may be accurately laid out\r\nin the following manner. Determine the general position by a few points\r\nmeasured off. Lay a pole upon the ground, in the direction of the walk;\r\nstick a peg in the ground at the first end and at its middle; move the\r\npole round a little, leaving the middle the same,--then stick a peg at\r\nits end, and move it forward--moving it forward and round equally, each\r\ntime, by measurement. A longer or shorter curve is made by a greater or\r\nless side-movement of the pole. In a regular curve, the movements are\r\nthe same; but in going from a shorter to a longer, or from a longer to a\r\nshorter curve, the side-measurement must increase or diminish regularly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Country Residence, Farm Buildings, Grounds, and\r\nFruit-Gardens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Laying out Curves.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First floor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chambers.]\r\n\r\nThe following cuts show the plan of the house: three principal rooms and\r\na bed-room below, and four rooms above. The hall extends through the\r\nhouse, affording good ventilation in summer, and entrance to each room,\r\nwithout passing through another. The chimney in the centre economizes\r\nheat. This small and cheap house affords more conveniences than most\r\nlarge ones. One of the finest things about such a house is a good\r\ncellar. For a farm-house, the cellar should be under the whole; make it\r\neight feet deep, gravel and water lime made smooth on the bottom,\r\nflagging under the bottom of the wall extending out a foot, the wall\r\nabove ground built double, the inside four inches thick, with brick,\r\nwith a space of two inches, and outside stone wall a foot thick. The\r\nwindows should be double and well fitted, the inside one hung on hinges;\r\nthe outside one to be removed in spring, and its place supplied with a\r\nwell-fitted frame, covered with wire-cloth to admit air and exclude\r\nintruders during summer. This will not freeze, and never need banking.\r\nNo rat can enter, for they always work close to the wall, and coming to\r\nthe projecting flat stone at the bottom, they give it up. On one side of\r\nthe cellar, under the kitchen, make a large rain-water cistern, with a\r\npump in the kitchen and a faucet in the cellar, and the whole\r\narrangement is perfect. If the farm be large, you will need some of the\r\ngood, but cheap houses described in the following part of this article,\r\nwhere your men will live and board themselves, which is always the best\r\nand cheapest way. An open view from the house in the country residence\r\nextends to the summer-house (_b_) on the right. This is one of the\r\nneatest cheap summer-houses that can be made. The following directions\r\nfor making it may be useful. Set eight cedar posts, six inches in\r\ndiameter, in the ground, in a circle; saw them off even at the top, and\r\nconnect them by plank nailed on their tops. Make an eight-sided roof of\r\nboards; nail lath from post to post, forming lattice-work, leaving a\r\nspace between two posts for a door. Put a seat around on the inside.\r\nLeave all the materials except the seat unplaned, and cover with a white\r\nor brown wash, and it need not cost more than five or six dollars, and,\r\ncovered with vines of some kind, it will be ornamental.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Summer-house.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Laborer's Cottage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of Laborer's Cottage.]\r\n\r\nThis form of a cheap house is convenient and pleasant. Built of\r\nfour-inch scantling, the plates and sills being connected only by the\r\nupright plank, and the wings thoroughly bracing the upright posts; when\r\nlumber is cheap, it may be built for one hundred and fifty or two\r\nhundred dollars, with cellar, well, and cistern. Occasional whitewash is\r\nas good as paint. With cellar under the whole, filled in with brick, and\r\nhaving blinds, it may cost three hundred and fifty dollars. The plan of\r\nthe house sufficiently explains itself.\r\n\r\nThe next cut illustrates a neat country-house, for a family who think\r\nmore of neatness, comfort, and intellectual pursuits, than of mere\r\nornament, and may serve the purpose of a farmhouse, or the residence of\r\na retired or professional gentleman. It has the unconstrained air of\r\nthe Italian style, without a rigid adherence to any rules, and may\r\ntherefore be altered or added to without destroying its effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Italian Farmhouse.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of Italian Farm House.]\r\n\r\nThe plan is intelligible without explanation. Built in a plain way, the\r\nfour large rooms not larger than fifteen by seventeen, and ten feet\r\nhigh, plain in its finish, it would cost about sixteen hundred dollars\r\ncomplete. It may go up from that, according to size and height of rooms,\r\nand style of finish, to three thousand dollars. It then makes as good a\r\nhouse as any person ever need to occupy, out of great cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYBRIDS.\r\n\r\nAlthough this subject has received far too little attention, yet our\r\nlimits will only allow us to mention a few facts, of the most practical\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nPlants hybridize only through their blossoms. This can only occur in\r\nplants of similarity, in nature and habits. Squashes and pumpkins\r\nplanted near each other mix badly, and the poorer will prevail.\r\nVarieties of corn mix at considerable distances, by the falling of\r\npollen from the tassel upon the silk of another variety. Watermelons are\r\nalways ruined by being planted near citrons. The seeds from melons so\r\ngrown will not produce one good melon. How far watermelons and\r\nmuskmelons, or squashes with melons, will hybridize, is uncertain. By\r\nplanting nutmeg muskmelons with the common roughskinned variety, we have\r\nproduced a kind about half way between them, that was of great\r\nexcellence. Two kinds of cabbage or turnip seed should never be raised\r\nin the same garden. Cabbage and turnip seed raised near together is\r\nvalueless. In strawberries, different plants are essential to each\r\nother, the quality of the fruit being determined by the plant\r\nfertilized, and not by the fertilizer. This subject is further treated\r\nunder articles on different plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nINARCHING.\r\n\r\nThis is a method of effecting a union of trees or branches, while both\r\nretain their hold in the ground. Shave off a little wood from each, and\r\nput them together, fitting closely, so that the barks will meet, as in\r\ngrafting; tie firmly, and cover with wax. When they have got well to\r\ngrowing, cut off the top of the old one, and after a while cut the new\r\none from the ground. When you have a tree that it is difficult to\r\npropagate in the usual way, you may transplant it to a thrifty stock.\r\nVigorous branches may by this means be transferred to old, poor-bearing,\r\nor slow-growing trees. So also may a tree be prolonged beyond its\r\nordinary age, as the pear on the quince, by inarching young shoots. We\r\ncan only recommend this to the curious experimenter, who has little else\r\nto do.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTS.\r\n\r\nThese are the natural enemies of fruits and plants; and to prevent their\r\ndepredations requires much care. There is no universal remedy. Birds and\r\nyoung fowls--especially ducks and chickens--are useful in a garden. The\r\nducks must not be kept there too long. They will appropriate a little to\r\ntheir own use, but will save much more for the proprietor. Insects have\r\ntheir peculiar tastes for particular fruits and plants, of which we have\r\ntreated, under those heads, respectively. Success in many branches of\r\nhorticulture and pomology, depends upon attention to the habits of\r\ninsects. The most general remedy is to wash trees or plants with a\r\nstrong decoction of some offensive herb, or with whale-oil soapsuds.\r\nTobacco is very useful for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRON FILINGS.\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained by analysis, that iron enters largely into the\r\ncomposition of the pear. Iron filings spread under them, or worked into\r\nthe soil, increases the growth of pear-trees, and improves the quality\r\nof the fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRRIGATION.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most important matters, that can engage the attention\r\nof agriculturists of the present day. A stream of water that may be\r\ncaused to flow gently over a field, or different parts of a farm, at\r\npleasure, is a mine of wealth. Plants receive their food from the air\r\nand water. We shall discuss this more fully when treating of manures. A\r\npoor, porous, sandy, or gravelly soil usually produces a fine crop, in a\r\nwet season. That is an addition to the soil of nothing but water. Hence\r\nall springs and streams can be turned to great account, on a farm or\r\ngarden. Watering gardens by hand or with a garden-pump, will often pay\r\nbetter than any other expenditure on the land. Employing a man, in a dry\r\nseason, to spend his whole time in watering five acres of garden, of\r\nberries and vegetables, as cabbages, vines, onions, and potatoes, will\r\npay a very large profit. Strawberries will bear twice as much and twice\r\nas long, for daily watering, after they begin to bud for blossoms, until\r\nthe fruit is gone. It is a necessary caution not to water irregularly,\r\nand only occasionally, in a dry season. Better not commence than to\r\nleave off, or neglect it in a dry time, before a rain. Read further in\r\nour article on \"Watering.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLABELS.\r\n\r\nIt is important, on many accounts, to have fruit-trees and shrubs well\r\nlabelled. Many labels have been invented. We prefer Cole's, as given in\r\nhis Fruit Book, to any other. Take a piece of sound pine or other soft\r\nwood, whittle two sides smooth, leaving one wider than the other, with a\r\nsharp corner between them. For one, cut one notch in the edge, and so up\r\nto four, four notches for four. For five, cut across the narrow side.\r\nFor ten cut across the wide side, and a notch for every ten up to forty.\r\nFor fifty, cut obliquely across the narrow side, and for one hundred cut\r\nobliquely across the wide side. Keep the names in a book, with numbers\r\ncorresponding with the notches or numbers on the labels.\r\n\r\nFasten these to trees, loosely, by a small copper or brass wire.\r\nTransported to any distance, exposed to any weather, or buried in the\r\nground, they will not be obliterated. Pieces of sheet lead, tin, or\r\nzinc, cut wide at one end, and written on with a sharp awl, and narrow\r\nat the other end, to be bent around a limb, will answer a pretty good\r\npurpose. Any soft wood, made smooth, and a little white paint applied,\r\nand written on with a good pencil, will preserve the mark for a long\r\ntime. Fasten with small wire. There are many labels, but we know none\r\npreferable to the above. By all means make labels accurate and\r\npermanent. Otherwise great losses may occur by budding or grafting from\r\nwrong varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANDSCAPE GARDENS.\r\n\r\nThese deserve much more attention than they receive in this country. On\r\nmost farms land enough is lying waste, to make a picturesque landscape,\r\nat a small expense. Trees planted, weeds destroyed, grass cultivated,\r\nand paths made, according to the most approved rules of carelessness,\r\nwould secure this object. With a wealthy man, the omission of such a\r\npark about his dwelling is hardly pardonable. Landscape gardening is an\r\nextensive subject. We can only give a few of the most general simple\r\nrules, that may be practised, without the possession of very large\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n1. Place the house some distance from the main street.\r\n\r\n2. Make the carriage-way leading to the house, at least twelve feet\r\nwide, and do not allow it to extend in a straight line, but in gentle\r\ncurves, around clusters of trees and plats of grass, apparently\r\nrendering the curves necessary.\r\n\r\n3. Have no large trees directly in front of the house.\r\n\r\n4. Plant trees of the thickest and greenest foliage near the house, and\r\nthose of more open tops at a greater distance. Standard pear, and\r\nhandsome cherry trees, do well planted among the forest trees. Clusters\r\nof them, at suitable distances, are not only beautiful, but they bear\r\nexceedingly well. They are well protected by the forest trees, and\r\nstanding alone are injured less by insects.\r\n\r\n5. Never set trees in a landscape garden, in straight rows, nor trees\r\nof similar size and form together. Nature never does so.\r\n\r\n6. Let none of the walks be straight lines, but curves, meandering among\r\ntrees and grass. If there be any water in the vicinity, let there be an\r\nopen space, giving a fair view of it from the house. If you have a\r\nstream, make rustic bridges over it, the plainer the better. Here and\r\nthere have rustic arbors. Attached to all this should be three other\r\ngardens, one of flowers, another of vegetables, and the third of fruits.\r\nThese three should never grow together. Fruit-trees ruin vegetables and\r\ninjure flowers. And flowers in a vegetable garden are mere weeds. A\r\nseparate plat for each is the correct rule, both for beauty and profit.\r\nAll this need require but little time and expense. All landholders can,\r\nat a moderate cost, live amid scenes of perpetual beauty, while the rich\r\nmay spend as much money in this way as they choose.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAYERING.\r\n\r\nThis is a method of propagation, by bending down a branch, and fastening\r\nit under the soil, leaving the upper end projecting, until it takes\r\nroot. Cut half way through the branch so as to raise the top, and fasten\r\nit at the point where it is cut, in a trench, with a stick thrust into\r\nthe ground over it nearly horizontally, or with a stick having a hook\r\nmade by cutting off a limb. Cover well with soil, and mulch it, and\r\nwater when dry. This done in the spring, in August the branch will be\r\nwell rooted, and may be cut away from the parent stalk. This is\r\nimportant in any tree or shrub (like the snowball), difficult to\r\npropagate by slips or grafting.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAYING IN TREES.\r\n\r\nDig a trench where water will not stand, and lay the trees in at an\r\nangle of forty-five degrees, and cover the roots and lower part, very\r\nclosely, with earth. In this way they may be well preserved through the\r\nwinter, if buried so deep that the tap-root will not freeze, which is\r\nalways injurious to trees that have been removed from their original\r\nsoil. Such freezing is always destructive to trees out of the ground.\r\nSmall trees and seedlings may be covered entirely, to be kept through\r\nthe winter. Put coarse straw manure on the earth, over trees large\r\nenough for setting, that are to be preserved heeled in during winter;\r\nand straw or corn-fodder over the tops, during the coldest weather, and\r\nthey will come out perfect in the spring.\r\n\r\nIf not ready to set out your trees at once, you may preserve them in\r\nperfect condition to very late in spring, in this way, by raising them\r\nonce, to check vegetation, and putting them back, and shading their\r\nstems and mulching the roots, after the commencement of warm weather.\r\nTrees may thus be preserved in better condition for transplanting than\r\nthose left in the nursery, and they will make a larger growth the first\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEEKS.\r\n\r\nThese are said to be natives of Switzerland. We think this doubtful, as\r\nthey are an article of daily food in Egypt, and were so highly esteemed\r\nthere, centuries ago, as to become an object of worship. They are used\r\nas a pot-herb, to give a flavor to soups and stews. They are not\r\nbulbous, like onions, but have a long stem, which is principally used.\r\nThey are transplanted very deep, so as to obtain a long white neck. The\r\nends of the roots are to be cut off when transplanted, and they should\r\nbe set in rows a foot apart, and from four to six inches in the row.\r\nThere are several varieties, distinguished mainly by the width of the\r\nleaves,--the _Flanders_ (or _narrow-leafed_), the _Scotch_, and the\r\n_Broad London_.\r\n\r\nWe know no use of leeks for which onions would not be equally good, and,\r\nhence, do not recommend their cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON.\r\n\r\nThis is the finest acid fruit grown, and belongs to warm climates; but\r\nby getting good budded trees from the South, and setting in\r\nglass-houses, protected from severe frosts, we may grow lemons in\r\nabundance at the North.\r\n\r\nBy a system of acclimation and protection, we anticipate seeing oranges\r\nand other Southern fruits grown at the North as a domestic luxury, and\r\nperhaps at a profit for market. The houses necessary for protection may\r\nbe worth more for other purposes than their cost and care, without\r\ninterfering with their use for orange and lemon culture.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTUCE.\r\n\r\nThe varieties are numerous, and most of them do well on very rich land,\r\nwell hoed. Only two kinds of summer-lettuce need be cultivated--the\r\n_ice-head lettuce_, and the _brown_. The ice-head has a very thick and\r\ntender leaf, continuing to be excellent up to midsummer, from one\r\nsowing; and if not allowed to stand nearer together than six inches, it\r\nwill produce fine heads. The brown lettuce is very large and very good.\r\nThere are other, earlier kinds, and many others that form large heads.\r\nBut we can get the above kinds early, by sowing in a hotbed and\r\ntransplanting; or by sowing so as to have plants get of considerable\r\nsize in the fall, and protect by covering in winter. These will be\r\nsuitable for the table early in the spring. Lettuce does better for\r\ntransplanting; it forms larger heads than in the original bed, and is a\r\nlittle later. Make the soil very rich with stable-manure. Lettuce is\r\nmore affected by the quality of the soil than most other vegetables.\r\nThis is a pleasant and healthy article of food, in spring and early\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICORICE.\r\n\r\nThis is a hardy plant from Southern Europe. The root in substance, or\r\nthe extracted dried juice, is much used. Needs a deep, rich soil. It is\r\npropagated by cuttings of roots set out in deeply-trenched land, in rows\r\nthree feet apart, and one foot in the row. Small vegetables may be grown\r\namong the plants the first year; afterward keep clear of weeds, and\r\nmanure every autumn. At the end of the third year, after the leaves are\r\ndead, take up the roots and dry them thoroughly. This does well at the\r\nSouth. A few roots are sufficient for a family, and the demand will not\r\nbe sufficient to require its culture very extensively as an article of\r\ncommerce. The low price of labor in Southern Europe enables them to\r\nsupply the demand cheaper than can be afforded in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIME.\r\n\r\nThis is a valuable application to the soil. For wheat it is very\r\nimportant, except on soil containing a large proportion of calcareous\r\nmatter. Usually air-slaked, and applied as a top-dressing, or plowed or\r\nharrowed in, its effects are important. On moist, sour land, producing\r\nwild grass, it corrects the acidity, introduces other grass, and\r\nprepares the soil for cultivation. On hard, stiff lands, it has a\r\ntendency to make them friable, and keep them in a mellow condition, thus\r\nsaving more than its cost, in the labor of cultivation. Very valuable\r\nin a compost heap. So much may be applied as to burn the soil and prove\r\ninjurious. It will not do as a substitute for everything else. See\r\nfurther on \"Manures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLIME.\r\n\r\nA fruit resembling the lemon, growing in the same climate, but of\r\nsmaller size. It is used for the same purposes as the lemon, but is not\r\nso valuable. Preserved green, it is highly esteemed. It is cultivated as\r\nthe orange and lemon, needing the same protection in cold climates. To\r\npreserve all these from destruction by insects, wash them in a strong\r\ndecoction of bitter or offensive herbs, or with whale-oil soap-suds;\r\ntobacco is very effectual. These remedies are useful on all fruit-trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.\r\n\r\nThis is important to everything we cultivate. But, as everything can not\r\nhave the best location, we should study it with reference to those\r\nthings most affected by it, especially fruits. Fruits escape late frosts\r\nwhen growing near rills or small brooks. Orchards near the shores of\r\nbodies of water--as on Lake Erie about Cleveland, Ohio--bear luxuriantly\r\nwhen all fruit a few miles back is cut off by late frosts. On the\r\nsummits of hills, fruits escape late frosts, when they are all cut off\r\nin the valleys below. On the Ohio river above Cincinnati, peaches are\r\nvery liable to destruction by late frosts. We have seen them all frozen\r\nthrough in one night, and turned black the next day, in the month of\r\nMay, after they had grown to the size of marrowfat-peas. One season,\r\nwhen there were no peaches in any other locality within a hundred miles,\r\nwe knew an orchard, on a Kentucky hill, so high and steep, that it took\r\nmiles of winding around the hill, to ascend it with a team. Those trees\r\nwere perfectly loaded with peaches, that sold on the tree at four\r\ndollars per bushel, and in Cincinnati market at seven to eight dollars.\r\nIn Ohio, Kentucky, and Virginia, there are such hills, that may be\r\nturned to more valuable account than any of the rest of their land, that\r\nare not now considered good for anything--even for sheep-pastures. The\r\nsame is true in the hilly parts of all the states. Good fruit of some\r\nkind will grow on them all, every year.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCUST-TREES.\r\n\r\nIt will soon be a great object with American farmers to cultivate\r\nlocust-trees, in all locations to which they are adapted. Even in this\r\nnew world, we shall soon be dependent on cultivated timber for\r\nfence-posts, railroad-ties, and building purposes. Our native forests\r\nare rapidly disappearing, while demand for timber is as rapidly\r\nincreasing. Probably no other tree is so profitable for cultivation in\r\nthis country as the locust. It is of rapid growth, and hard and durable,\r\nand adapted to many uses. The second-growth locust is not so durable as\r\nthe native forest-tree, as found in parts of Ohio; but, cut at a\r\nsuitable age and at the right season of the year, it is as durable as\r\nwhite cedar, and much more valuable. The profits of the culture would be\r\ngreat. An acre of locust-trees fifteen or twenty years old would be\r\nworth fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars. The expense of growing\r\nit, aside from the use of the land, would be trifling. The grove would\r\nafford a good place for fowls, while the blossoms would be nearly equal\r\nto white clover for honey. The limbs would make excellent wood, and the\r\nground would need no planting for a second growth. Fortunate will be the\r\nmen on the prairies of the West, and along the railroads and rivers of\r\nthe land, who shall early plant fields of locust. The profits of it will\r\ngreatly exceed the increase in the value of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURES.\r\n\r\nSoils, manures, and preparing the soil--plowing, harrowing, &c.--are the\r\nthree great subjects in any good agricultural work. We shall treat this\r\nsubject under the following divisions:--\r\n\r\n1. The substances of which manures are composed.\r\n\r\n2. Preparation and saving of manures.\r\n\r\n3. Time and modes of application.\r\n\r\n4. The principles of their action upon plants.\r\n\r\nManures are of two classes--called putrescent and fossil. The putrescent\r\nare composed of decayed, or decaying, vegetable and animal substances.\r\nThe fossil are those dug from the earth, as lime, marl, and gypsum. All\r\nvegetable substances not useful for other purposes are valuable for\r\nmanure. Rotten wood, leaves, straw, and all the vegetable parts of\r\nstable manure, and any spoiled vegetables or grain, are all valuable. At\r\nthe South, their immense quantities of cotton-seed are a mine of wealth,\r\nif properly prepared and applied as manure. Animal manures consist of\r\nthe animal parts of stable manure, dry and liquid, parts of bones,\r\nbrine, spoiled meat, kitchen slops, soapsuds, and all dead animals. In\r\ndecaying, these substances all pass through a process of fermentation.\r\nLeft exposed without suitable care, they become unhealthy and offensive.\r\nIt is probable that a large share of the diseases suffered in the rural\r\ndistricts are caused by these impurities; and the impossibility of\r\nkeeping large cities free from these substances is the cause of their\r\nincreased mortality. In the country, a little timely caution and labor,\r\nin removing these substances and regulating their fermentation, would\r\nsave much sickness; while the labor would pay a larger per-cent. profit\r\nthan any other performed on the soil. No manures should be allowed to\r\nferment, or decay, without being mixed or covered with enough common\r\nearth, sand, peat, or muck, to retain all the gases and exhalations of\r\nsuch putrescence. The smallest quantity that will answer is one load of\r\nearth to two of the decaying substances. The proportions reversed would\r\nbe better: put one bushel of lime to two loads, two quarts of ground\r\nplaster, and half a bushel of ashes, and you have the very best compost\r\nheap. The following are brief general rules for the preparation of\r\nmanures. It is always most economical to feed cattle in the stable or\r\nunder cover, and never have manure exposed to the weather. But if cattle\r\nmust be fed outdoor, let them be fed in a yard, lowest in the centre,\r\nthat the liquids and washings may run into the centre, and be absorbed\r\nby straw and litter. Put manure on the land, or into heaps for compost,\r\nbefore very warm weather. Always feed sheep under cover, and keep their\r\nmanure from rain; heap it together with earth in the spring, or apply it\r\nto the soil at once. Manure thrown out of a stable should be kept under\r\ncover, out of the rain, and not allowed to heat in winter; its best\r\nqualities are evaporated by fermentation in the yard. Manures often\r\nrained on in winter, or left in large piles without intermixture of\r\nearth, lime, plaster, and ashes, will ferment and waste. Construct your\r\nstables so that the liquid manure will run into a vat filled with earth;\r\nmuck is best. Experiments have shown that the liquid manures are at\r\nleast one sixth better than the solid. A gentleman dug a pit, thirty-six\r\nfeet square and four feet deep, and walled it in on all sides. He filled\r\nhis vat from a cultivated field, and so constructed his sewers from the\r\nstables adjoining that the urine saturated the whole. He kept fourteen\r\nhead of cattle there for five months, allowing none but the liquid part\r\nof the manure to pass into the vat. He spread forty loads of this on an\r\nacre. For ten years he tried equal quantities of this and well rotted\r\nand prepared stable-manure, side by side, in the same field, and\r\nobtained great crops; but in no stage of their growth could he see that\r\ncrops on the land manured from the stable were any better than those\r\nthat had received only the soil from the vat. The latter were quite as\r\ngood as the former. The contents of his vat manured seven acres, or half\r\nan acre to each creature stabled. The result is proof that one cow\r\ndischarges urine sufficient in five months to manure abundantly half an\r\nacre of land. Save the solid manure equally well, and a cow will make\r\nmanure enough, in five or six months, to increase a crop sufficiently to\r\npay for herself. It is certainly safe to say, that a careful man can\r\nmake the manure of a cow pay for her body every year. Is not this an\r\nimportant branch of farming operations? Few pay sufficient attention to\r\nit. Fowls should roost where their droppings may be mixed with common\r\ngarden soil or loam. The manure from each fowl, carefully saved and\r\njudiciously applied, will pay for its body twice a year. The hogstye may\r\nbe very productive of manure, one fourth better than that from the\r\nstable. Connected with your hogpen, have a yard fifteen feet square for\r\nevery five hogs; let that yard have no floor. Throw the straw out of\r\ntheir sleeping-room frequently to make room for new; throw into the\r\nyard, also, all sorts of weeds, refuse vegetables, corn-husks, peapods,\r\n&c.; also the dirt that will naturally accumulate in the backyard of a\r\ndwelling, including sawdust, fine chips, cleanings of cellars, scrapings\r\nof ditches, and occasionally a load of loam, muck, or clay--and six\r\nloads of manure to each hog may be made, that will prove far better than\r\nany stable manure; it has been known to produce fifty bushels of corn to\r\nthe acre, when stable-manure produced but forty bushels. Old wood,\r\nbrush, and chips, should never be allowed to remain on uncultivated,\r\nuseless land. Wood throws out the same amount of heat in decaying as it\r\ndoes when consumed as fuel. The action of that heat on the soil is\r\nhighly beneficial, retaining it long in a mellow state: hence, all wood,\r\ntoo old to be of value for any other purpose, should be put in heaps,\r\ncovered up till decomposed, and then applied to the soil, as other\r\nmanures. For potatoes or vines, but especially melons, it is preferable\r\nto any other manure. Nothing is so good for muskmelons as old chips\r\nfrom the woodyard. Leaves of fruit and forest trees are also very good;\r\nblood and offal of animals, hair, hoofs, bones, horns, refuse feathers,\r\nwoollen rags, mud from sewers, rivers, roads, swamps, or ponds, turf,\r\nashes, old brine, soapsuds, all kinds of fish, oyster and clam\r\nshells--all are valuable, and no part of them should ever be thrown away\r\nor wasted; they are all good in compost heaps, or applied directly to\r\nthe soil. Bones are best ground, but may be used whole, pounded, or\r\nchemically dissolved, or mixed with alternate layers of fresh\r\nhorse-manure, they will be decomposed by the fermentation of the manure\r\n(see \"Bones\"). Perhaps there is as much imprudence in wasting manures as\r\nin any part of American domestic economy. One who leaves his stock\r\nwithout care, and so exposed to the weather as to lose half of them and\r\ninjure the others, is not fit to be a farmer; yet, many waste manure\r\nthat would produce plants for man and beast, of far more value than the\r\nloss of stock complained of, and yet no one notices it--it is a matter\r\nof course, exciting no surprise. Wastefulness in a family, if it be of\r\nbread, flour, or meat, is considered wicked and impoverishing; while ten\r\ntimes that amount may be wasted in manures, that would enrich the soil,\r\nand excite little or no disapprobation. We hope the agricultural\r\nperiodicals will keep this subject before the people, until these mines\r\nof wealth will no longer be neglected or wasted.\r\n\r\n_Application of Manures_ is a subject that has been much discussed, and\r\nrespecting which, intelligent agriculturists differ materially. Some\r\napply them extensively as a top-dressing for grass lands. This does much\r\ngood, but probably one half of their virtues is lost by washing rains,\r\nand by evaporation. A better way is not to keep land down in grass long\r\nat a time, and, when under the plow, manure thoroughly. We knew a piece\r\nof light land that annually produced half a ton of hay per acre. The\r\nowner plowed it up, raised a crop, put a moderate quantity of\r\nstable-manure, and ten loads of leached ashes to the acre. We saw it in\r\nhaying time, the third season after it had been manured and subsoiled\r\nand seeded down, and they were then taking fully three tons of timothy\r\nhay from an acre, which was the quantity it had yielded three years in\r\nsuccession, without any top-dressing. If a top-dressing of manure is to\r\nbe applied, harrow the land quite thoroughly, and always apply the\r\nmanure in the fall--it is worth twice as much as when applied in the\r\nspring. The rains and snows of winter cause it to sink into the soil,\r\nwhile the heat of spring and summer evaporate it. A mixture of plaster,\r\nlime, ashes, and a very little salt, sowed on meadows, immediately after\r\nhaying, secures a good growth of feed, much sooner than it will come on\r\nother meadows. It also increases, quite considerably, the hay crop of\r\nthe following season. It is a universal rule not to allow manure to lie\r\nlong on the surface to which it is applied, before plowing in. Place\r\nmanure in heaps, as large as will be convenient for spreading, and\r\nspread it just before the plow. Never spread manure one day to be plowed\r\nin the next. When manuring in the hill, have the planters follow the\r\nmanure-cart. In manuring potatoes in the hill, drop the potatoes, and\r\nput the manure on them and cover at once. In a dry season, the yield\r\nwill be double that of those planted in the usual way. For fall grains,\r\nplow in the manure, just before sowing the seed. This is better than\r\nplowing it in under the sod. If the land be not sod land, and you can\r\nplow the manure in only deep enough to cover it, and then, just before\r\nsowing the seed, plow again very deep, the effect is excellent. Apply\r\nmanure to land in the fall, or just after harvest, and plow it in, let\r\nthe land remain till spring, and then plow deep, and you get the best\r\npossible effect. On an onion crop, manure does the most good on the\r\nsurface. On those raised from sets, or on any onions, after they get\r\nlarge enough to give room, put fine manure enough to keep down all\r\nweeds, and it will double the crop.\r\n\r\nGypsum is better sowed than in any other way. Mixed with a little lime\r\nand salt, or wood-ashes and salt, the effect on corn is better than from\r\neither alone. To hoed crops apply these articles twice, and always by\r\nsowing, and not by putting it around or upon the hills; the effect is\r\nmuch greater sowed, besides the labor that is saved. In applying guano,\r\ndo not allow it to come in contact with the plants, as it is apt to\r\ndestroy them.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to consider the principles on which manure acts upon\r\nsoils, and produces growth in plants. The action of manure on the soil,\r\nby which it is enabled to retain and appropriate moisture, constitutes\r\nits main, if not its whole benefit. It may afford a stimulus to the\r\nroots of plants. Even the specific manures, that are supposed to supply\r\norganic matter to particular plants, may impart their benefits by their\r\naction upon the air and water. Facts are certainly at hand to show that\r\nthe great and leading benefits of manures are in their control of\r\nmoisture, and where that control is not needed, plants get a great\r\ngrowth on what we call poor soil. No manures, either fossil or\r\nputrescent, afford any considerable food for plants. Vegetation\r\nreceives its growth mainly from water and from the atmosphere. Facts in\r\nsupport of this theory are abundant.\r\n\r\nA trial was made to ascertain whence comes the matter of which a tree is\r\ncomposed. A quantity of kiln-dried earth was weighed and then put into a\r\ntight vessel. A willow shrub was also weighed and planted in that earth,\r\nand the vessel covered with perforated tin to keep out the dust; for a\r\nyear and a half it was supplied only with pure water. The tree was then\r\ntaken out, and found, by weight, to have gained one hundred and sixty\r\npounds. The earth was then kiln-dried, as before, and weighed, and its\r\nweight was found to be only two ounces less than it was a year and a\r\nhalf before, when it was deposited there. The tree, then, must have\r\nreceived its growth, not from the soil, but from the water or the\r\natmosphere, or both.\r\n\r\nAnother fact: take a load of manure, dry it thoroughly, and weigh it.\r\nThen moisten it and apply it to the soil, and it will increase the\r\nweight of vegetation from ten to thirty or forty times its own weight\r\nwhen dry, and yet most of that manure may still be found in the soil.\r\nHence it can only feed plants in a very limited degree. Its action must\r\nbe on air and water, or the control it gives the soil over those\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nIt is also matter of common observation that soil well manured, will\r\ncontinue moist for a long time after similar land by its side, but which\r\nhas not been manured, is dried up. Hard coarse soils dry up very\r\nquickly, while soft, mellow, and friable ones will endure a long\r\ndrought. The gases and moisture generated by the decomposition of\r\nmanures produce this mellow state. Hence the necessity of having that\r\ndecomposition take place under the soil, or of plowing in the manure.\r\n\r\nAnother important fact bearing on this question is, that what are\r\nregarded very poor soils, such as light sandy or gravelly land, will\r\nproduce good crops in a season remarkable for the frequency of showers.\r\nOn such soils crops are from twice to four times as large, in a wet\r\nseason as in a dry, and yet there is an addition of nothing but\r\nmoisture, and in such a manner, as not to have it stand and become\r\nstagnant among the roots of the plants.\r\n\r\nYet another evidence is in the strength of clay soils. A hard clay is\r\nvery unproductive. But so disintegrated that plants can grow in it, it\r\nproduces a great crop. This is because clay is of so close a texture,\r\nthat when mixed with manure, turf, sand, or muck, although friable, it\r\nretains more moisture, than sand or ordinary loam. This is the reason of\r\nthe superior fertility of land annually overflowed with water, as Egypt\r\nin the vicinity of the Nile. It is not that the Nile brings down\r\ndeposites from the mountains of the Moon, so rich above all that is in\r\nthe valleys below. The entire weight of all that a river deposites on\r\nten acres would not equal in weight the increased vegetation of a single\r\nacre. The cause of the increased fertility is the fact that the deposite\r\nis so fine that it prevents rapid evaporation, and thus causes the soil\r\nto retain moisture for the large growth, and maturity of the plants.\r\n\r\nOne more evidence is found on our sandy pine plains. Our common\r\nforest-trees, as beech, maple, elm, or linden, will not flourish there.\r\nSuch land will produce comparatively no corn, oats, or wheat. But rye\r\nthat stands drought better than any other grain, grows tolerably well.\r\nBut such plains always produce an enormous growth of pine timber, hardly\r\nequalled in the number of cords to the acre, by the heaviest-timbered\r\nland of the river bottoms. Why is this? Does a maple need so much more\r\nfood than a pine, or is it in the habits of the trees? It is not in the\r\nrichness or poverty of the soil, but in the adaptation of the trees to\r\nreach and appropriate moisture. The roots of the maple and beech, spread\r\nout near the surface of the ground. And it being a light, porous, sandy\r\nsoil, it does not retain moisture enough to promote their growth. But\r\nwhoever notices a pine-tree that has been turned up from the roots by\r\nthe wind, will see that the roots run down almost perpendicularly ten or\r\nfifteen feet into the sand. There they find plenty of moisture and hence\r\ntheir great growth. This principle explains the comparative\r\nproductiveness of all soils.\r\n\r\nA soil composed of light muck, or a kind of peet-soil, will dry up soon.\r\nThere is nothing to prevent rapid evaporation; hence it is always\r\nunproductive, for want of suitable moisture. Mix with it clay, to render\r\nits texture more firm, and it will retain the moisture, and be very\r\nproductive. Clay alone is too solid to retain moisture; it runs off, as\r\nfrom a brick. Mix sand with it, and it becomes mellow, and retains\r\nmoisture, and produces great growth. Sand allows so free and rapid an\r\nevaporation that it is unproductive. We say it leaches and is hungry,\r\nand so it is, because it has little power to retain water. Our manures\r\ndo it good, only as they are calculated to aid it in controlling\r\nmoisture. If we apply a light manure as we would to clay, it is\r\ncomparatively useless; it adds no firmness to the texture of the soil,\r\nand hence does not increase its capacity for controlling water. On such\r\nland, the only good that manure does, is while decomposition is taking\r\nplace in the soil, it renders it more moist, and hence more productive.\r\nApply clay to such a soil, and it will increase its firmness and\r\nconsequent capacity of retaining and appropriating moisture, and thus\r\nrender it highly valuable. Dry straw manure is sometimes said to dry up\r\nland, and ruin crops. So of turf in a dry season. In a wet season they\r\ngreatly increase the growth of crops. Now they contain just as much food\r\nfor plants in one season as another. Hence a soil too easily impervious\r\nto the atmosphere, will be a poor soil, that is, will produce poorly,\r\nsimply because it has no power to retain the necessary moisture.\r\n\r\nWe suppose these facts and reasons to establish our theory, that the\r\nprincipal benefit of manures, and of mixing different soils, is in the\r\ncontrol they give over the moisture and the atmosphere. Hence the\r\ngreatly increased crop of clover from the application of three quarters\r\nof a bushel of plaster to an acre. The increased weight of clover on\r\nfive square rods, would outweigh the plaster applied, and still that\r\nplaster remains, in almost its full weight, on the soil. This principle\r\nexplains the benefit of mulching trees, plants, or vegetables. This is\r\nthe best means of preserving trees, the first year after transplanting,\r\nand of securing a great growth, of any kind of shrubs or plants. This\r\nmay be done with common straw or leaves. Now wherein is their utility?\r\nNot in the nourishment they afford the plants, but in the fact that\r\nmulching so covers the surface as to prevent rapid evaporation. In such\r\ncases, it is the more abundant moisture that secures the greater\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nHence the first study of a soil culturist should be to ascertain how he\r\nshall so mix and manage the materials at his command, as to cause them\r\nto retain moisture for the longest time, without leaving water to stand\r\nabout the roots of his plants. On this depends the whole importance of\r\ndeep plowing and ditching. On this theory we may also account for the\r\nfact that certain plants prefer a certain kind of manure to all others.\r\nIt is that those plants act in a certain manner on the soil requiring a\r\nspecific action of manure to enable it to appropriate moisture and tax\r\nthe atmosphere for their growth. This theory explains why too much\r\nmanure is bad. Not because we give too much food to plants, but because\r\nexcess of manure dries up the land. But whatever theory we adopt, we all\r\nagree in the utility of fertilizers. And the experience of practical\r\nfarmers is of more value in aiding us to reach right conclusions, than\r\nall chemical essays on the subject that have ever been written.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARL.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the best distributed and most universal fertilizers. Marl\r\nproper contains nearly equal proportions of clay and lime. Sand-marl is\r\nspoken of, in which sand and lime are the main ingredients. Clay-marls\r\nare to be applied to sandy and gravelly soils, and sand-marls to clayey\r\nsoils. Shell-marls are very valuable, and seldom contain clay. Marls may\r\neasily be known, even by those not at all acquainted with chemistry.\r\nApply any mineral acid, or even very strong vinegar, and if it be a\r\nmarl, an effervescence will at once be observed: this effect is\r\nproduced by acid upon lime.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARJORUM.\r\n\r\nThere are two varieties in cultivation--the _sweet_, an annual herb; and\r\nthe _winter_, a hardy perennial. They are grown and used as summer\r\nsavory--used green, or dried for winter. They give a sweet, aromatic\r\nflavor to soups, stews, and dressings. The cultivation is, in all\r\nrespects, like other garden-herbs of the kind, whether for medicinal or\r\nculinary purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELONS.\r\n\r\nThere are two species--musk and water melons--which are subdivided into\r\nmany varieties of each. These are among the most delicious of all the\r\nproducts of the garden. A little use makes all persons very fond of\r\nthem. The climate of the Middle and Southern states is well adapted to\r\nraising melons; much better than the same latitudes in Europe. The\r\nfollowing brief directions will insure success in their cultivation. A\r\nlight, rich soil is always desirable. There should always be a little\r\nsand in the composition of soil for melons. If not there naturally,\r\nsupply it; it will always pay. The warm sands of Long Island and New\r\nJersey are the best possible for melons, especially for water-melons. It\r\nmay be well to trench deep for the hills, and mix in a little\r\nwell-rotted manure, and cover it with fine mould. A quantity of manure,\r\nleft in bulk under the hills, will dry them up at the worst possible\r\ntime. When you plant only a few in a garden, mulch your musk-melons with\r\nchips or sawdust from the wood-yard, or leaves and decayed wood from\r\nthe forest, and you will get a great growth. They will grow luxuriantly\r\nin a pile of chips, with a little soil, in a door-yard, where hardly any\r\nother plant would flourish. The water-melon does best in almost pure\r\nsand, if it be enriched with liquid or some other of the finer manures.\r\nPlant musk-melons six feet apart, and water-melons nine feet each way.\r\nWhen the plants become established, never leave more than two or three\r\nin a hill. The product will be greatly increased in number and size, by\r\npicking off the end bud of the first runners when they show their\r\nblossom-buds; this causes them to throw out many strong lateral vines,\r\nwhich will produce abundantly. The attacks of striped bugs, so well\r\nknown as the enemies of vines, and also of the black fleas, or hoppers\r\n(very minute, but quite destructive to tender vines when first up), may\r\nbe prevented (says Downing) by sprinkling near the plants a little\r\nguano. As but a small portion of cultivators will have it, or can obtain\r\nit, we recommend to put many seeds in a hill, to provide for the\r\ndepredations of the bugs, and sprinkle offensive articles around them.\r\nThese will not always be effectual. We have recommended elsewhere to\r\nfence each hill, as the most effectual method. A box, with gauze or a\r\npane of glass over the top, is a certain remedy in every case; it also\r\ngreatly promotes the growth of the young vines. This is equally\r\neffectual against the cutworm and all other insects; and, as the boxes\r\nwill last a dozen years or so, we should use them if we had ten acres of\r\nmelons. But by early and late planting, and watchfulness, and\r\nreplanting, you will succeed without protection. An excessive quantity\r\nof stable-manure does not increase the growth, especially of\r\nwater-melons. Plaster, bonedust, and ashes, are good applications;\r\nhog-manure is the best of all. The seeds should be soaked two days, and\r\nplanted an inch deep on broad hills, raised in the centre four inches\r\nabove the level of the bed, that water may not stand around them;\r\nplanted low, they sometimes perish in a few hours in a hot sun, after a\r\nrain. Hoe them often, but never when they are wet, and never hoe near\r\nthem after they have commenced running; the roots spread, about as much\r\nas the vines, and hoeing deep near them cuts off the roots, and\r\nmaterially injures them. Many a promising plat of melons has been ruined\r\nby stirring the soil when they were wet, and hoeing around them after\r\nthey had begun to run. In walking among melons, great harm is done by\r\nstepping on the ends of vines. No one should be allowed among melons but\r\nthe one who hoes or picks them. Many are lost by drought, after great\r\ncare. We have often used an effectual remedy; it consists in turning up\r\nthe vines, if they have begun to run before the drought, and putting\r\naround each hill from a peck to half a bushel of wet, well rotted\r\nmanure; that from a spent hotbed is excellent for this purpose; and hoe\r\nfrom a distance between the hills, and cover the manure an inch or two\r\ndeep with fine mould, lay down the vines, and saturate the hill with\r\nwater, and they will hardly get dry again during the season. A little\r\njudicious watering will give you a great crop in the most severe\r\ndrought.\r\n\r\n_Varieties of the Musk-melon._--These are numerous, and the nomenclature\r\nuncertain. The London Horticultural Society's catalogue enumerates\r\nseventy. Most of them are of no use to any one. Two or three of the best\r\nare sufficient. There are three general classes of musk-melons--the\r\n_green-fleshed_, as the citron and nutmeg; _yellow-fleshed_, as the\r\ncantelope, or long yellow; and _Persian melon_. The last is the finest\r\nof all, but is too tender for general cultivation with us, requiring\r\nmuch care and very warm seasons. The yellow-fleshed are very large, but\r\nmuch inferior in quality to either of the others. The green-fleshed are\r\n_the_ musk-melons for this whole country. The nutmeg has long been\r\ncelebrated; but, it being much smaller than the citron, and in no way\r\nsuperior in quality, we think the latter the best for all American\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\nThe following are enumerated in \"White's Gardening for the South,\" as\r\nadapted to the latitude of the Southern states: _Christiana_,\r\n_Beechwood_, _Hoosainee_, _Sweet Ispahan_, _Pineapple_, _Cassabar_,\r\n_Netted Citron_, and _Rock_. These are doubtless all fine, and would do\r\nwell at the North, with suitable care and protection. Downing's\r\ncatalogue is nearly the same, with a very few additions.\r\n\r\n_Varieties of Water-melons_--are also numerous, and names uncertain. The\r\nbest varieties, however, are well known. The most choice are the\r\nfollowing: _Imperial_, _Carolina_, _Black Spanish_, _Mountain-Sprout_,\r\n_Mountain-Sweet_, _Apple-seeded_, and _Ice-cream_. The following\r\nexcellent water-melons all originated in South Carolina: _Souter_;\r\n_Clarendon_, or _dark-speckled_; _Bradford_, very dark-green, with\r\nstripes mottled and streaked with green; _Ravenscroft_, and _Odell's\r\nlarge white_. There is a fine little melon, called the orange-melon,\r\nbecause the flesh and skin separate like an orange. These varieties will\r\nall do well with care. To preserve any one of them, it must be grown at\r\nsome distance from other varieties. All water-melons should be far\r\nremoved from citrons, which resemble them, raised only for preserving.\r\nThey always ruin the next generation of water-melons. Different\r\nvarieties of musk-melons planted together produce hybrids, partaking of\r\nthe qualities of both, and are often very fine. We raised a cross\r\nbetween the yellow-fleshed cantelope and the nutmeg, which was\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nSeeds of most vines are better for being two or three years old, as they\r\nproduce less vines, but more fruit. Melons are a luxury that should grow\r\nin every garden, and the state should enact severe laws against stealing\r\nthem, making the punishment no less than fine and imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILLET.\r\n\r\nThis is a species of grain, partaking much of the nature of a large\r\ngrass. Sowed thin, it produces a good yield. The seed is excellent for\r\nfowls. Ground, it is good for keeping or fattening all domestic animals.\r\nIt is about equal to Indian corn for bread. Cut while green, but when\r\nnearly ripe, it is a good substitute for hay, producing a much larger\r\nquantity per acre. All animals prefer millet, cut in the milk, to hay.\r\nIt is a less profitable crop for grain, on account of the irregularity\r\nof its ripening, and its extreme liability to shell, when dry. It must\r\nbe cut as soon as the seed begins to harden. It also attracts swarms of\r\nbirds, which are exceedingly fond of the seed. About three tons per acre\r\nis an average crop on tolerably good land. From one to three pecks of\r\nseed to the acre are sown broadcast. When sown in drills and cultivated,\r\nit grows very large, and requires only four quarts of seed per acre. It\r\nwill make good fodder sown at any time from April to July. Its more\r\nextensive cultivation for fodder is recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINT.\r\n\r\nThis genus of plants comprises twenty-four species. Those usually\r\ncultivated in gardens are three, _Peppermint_, _Spearmint_, and\r\n_Pennyroyal mint_. All mints are propagated by the same methods. Parting\r\nthe roots, offset young plants, and cuttings from the stalks. Spearmint\r\nand peppermint like a moist and even wet soil. Pennyroyal does better in\r\na rich loam. Plants come into use the same season they are set. Set the\r\nplants eight inches apart, and on beds four feet wide, leaving a path\r\ntwo feet between them. In field culture, for the oils and essences,\r\nplace them two feet apart, for the convenience of going between the rows\r\nwith a horse. Thus cultivation becomes easy. They should be cut in full\r\nblossom, and dried in small bunches in the shade, but better by\r\nartificial heat, like hops. They should be cut when dry. For domestic\r\nuses, dry quickly, and pulverize, and put away in tight glass bottles.\r\nThey will retain all their strength, keep free from dust, and always be\r\nready for use. The same is true of all the herbs for domestic use. As a\r\nfield crop, mints are profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nMULBERRY.\r\n\r\nThere are three varieties cultivated in this country. We place them in\r\nthe order of their qualities:--\r\n\r\n1. _The Johnson._--A new variety, thus described by Kirtland: \"Fruit\r\nvery large; oblong cylindric; blackish, subacid, and of mild and\r\nagreeable flavor. Growth of wood strong.\"\r\n\r\n2. _The Black Mulberry._--An Asiatic variety, rather tender for the\r\nNorth, though it succeeds tolerably well in some parts of New England.\r\nFruit large and delicious; tree low and spreading. Easily cultivated on\r\nalmost any soil. Propagated by seeds, layers, cuttings, or roots.\r\n\r\n3. _The Red Mulberry._--A native of this country. Fruit small and\r\npleasant, but inferior to the two preceding.\r\n\r\n\r\nMULCHING.\r\n\r\nThis is placing around plants or trees, coarse manure or litter of any\r\nkind, to keep down weeds, and prevent too rapid evaporation of moisture.\r\nAll straw, corn stalks, old weeds or stubble, forest leaves, seaweeds,\r\nold wood, sawdust, old tanbark, chips, &c., are good for mulching. Any\r\ntree taken up and planted with reasonable care, and well mulched and\r\nwatered, will live. One of fifty need not die. Cover the loose earth\r\ndeep enough to prevent the springing of weeds. Put a little earth on the\r\nouter edge of the manure, leaving it dishing about the tree. Fill that\r\noccasionally with water, and you will get a good growth, even in a dry\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nPlant gooseberries or currants, and mulch the whole ground between the\r\nbushes, and give them no other cultivation, and the berries will grow\r\nnearly twice as large as the same varieties standing neglected, to grow\r\nup to weeds, in the usual way. Mulching with clean, dry straw, or with\r\ncharcoal, is a preventive of mildew. It is the easiest method of taking\r\ncare of strawberries after they are in blossom; the vines will bear much\r\nmore and finer fruit, and it will be clean and neat. Mulching vines is a\r\ngreat means of insuring a crop. Every crop that can be mulched will be\r\ngreatly benefited by it; hence, all the straw and litter that can be\r\nsaved is money in the pocket; for mulching alone, it is worth five times\r\nas much as it can be sold for. Burning or in any way destroying cobs,\r\ncornstalks, stubble, old straw, or decaying wood, is extravagant\r\nwastefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS\r\n\r\nAre vegetables growing up in old pastures, or on land mulched and the\r\nstraw partly covered with soil. They are also cultivated in beds for the\r\npurpose. Picked at the right stage, they are a fine article of diet,\r\nalmost equalling oysters. The use of the wild ones, however, is attended\r\nwith some danger, for the want of knowledge of the varieties, or of the\r\ndifference between the genuine mushroom, and the toadstools that so much\r\nresemble them.\r\n\r\nPersons have been poisoned unto death by eating toadstools instead of\r\nmushrooms. When of middle size, mushrooms are distinguished by the fine\r\npink or flesh color of their gills, and by their pleasant smell. In a\r\nmore advanced stage, the gills become of a chocolate color; they are\r\nthen apt to be confounded with injurious kinds. The toadstool that most\r\nresembles the true mushroom is slimy to the touch, and rather\r\ndisagreeable to the smell. The noxious kind grows in the borders of\r\nwoods, while the mushroom only grows in the open field. It is better,\r\nhowever, not to eat them unless gathered by a practised hand, so as to\r\nbe sure of no mistake. With the help of one accustomed to gathering\r\nthem, you will learn in a few moments, so as to be accurate and safe.\r\n\r\n_Mushroom Beds._--Prepare a bed in the corner of the hothouse, or, in\r\nthe absence of that, in a warm, dry cellar. The first of October is the\r\nbest time. Make the bed four feet wide, and as long as you require. It\r\nshould be one foot high perpendicularly at the edges, and sloping toward\r\nthe middle; it should be of horse-manure, well forked, and put in\r\ncompact and even, so as to settle all alike. Cover it with long straw,\r\nto preserve heat and the exhalations that would rise. At the end of ten\r\ndays, the heat will be such as to allow you to remove the straw, and put\r\nan inch of good mould over the top of the bed. On this put the spawn or\r\nseed of the mushroom, in rows of six inches apart. The spawn are white\r\nfibres, found in old pastures, where mushrooms grow, or in old spent\r\nhotbeds, and sometimes under old stable floors. The warmth of the bed\r\nwill produce mushrooms plentifully for a considerable time. If the\r\nproduction diminishes and nearly ceases, it may be renewed by removing\r\nthe mould, and putting on good horse-manure to the depth of twelve\r\ninches, and covering and planting as before, and the production will be\r\nplentiful for a number of weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSTARD.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds cultivated, the black and the white, annuals, and\r\nnatives of Great Britain. The white mustard is cultivated in this\r\ncountry principally for greens, and sometimes for a small salad like the\r\ncress. It may be sown at any time from opening of spring to the\r\nbeginning of autumn. But sown in hot weather, the bed must be shaded.\r\nThe Spaniards prefer the white mustard for grinding for table use,\r\nbecause of its mildness and its whiter flour. White mustard-seed, being\r\nmuch larger than the black, is preferred for mangoes, and all pickling\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nBlack mustard is cultivated principally in the field, for the mills. It\r\nis there ground, and makes the well known condiment found on most\r\ntables.\r\n\r\nSow in March or April, broadcast on land tolerably free from weeds, and\r\nif you get it too thick, hoe up a part. In July or August, you may get a\r\ngood crop. Cradle it as wheat, before ripe enough to shell.\r\n\r\nMustard used in various ways is medicinal. It is one of the safest and\r\nmost speedy emetics. Stir up a table-spoonful of the flour and drink it.\r\nFollow it with repeated draughts of warm water, and in half an hour, you\r\nwill have gone through all the stages of a thorough emetic, without\r\nhaving been weakened by it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNASTURTIUM.\r\n\r\nThis annual plant, found in most gardens, is too well known to need\r\ndescription. Were it not so common, its flowers, that appear in great\r\nprofusion, from early summer till destroyed by frost, would be regarded\r\nvery beautiful. Its main use is for pickles. Its green berries are\r\nnearly equal to capers for that purpose. It grows well on any good\r\ngarden soil; bears more berries on less vines, planted on land not too\r\nrich. Single vines four feet apart, on rich land, do best.\r\n\r\n\r\nNECTARINE.\r\n\r\nThis is only a fine variety of the peach, having a smooth skin. Downing\r\ngives instances of its return to the peach, and others of the production\r\nof nectarines and peaches on the same limb. The appearance of the tree\r\nis hardly distinguishable from the peach. It is one of the most\r\nbeautiful of dessert fruits: it has no down on the skin, being entirely\r\nsmooth and beautiful, like waxwork. Its smooth skin exposes it to the\r\nravages of the curculio. It is longer-lived on plum-stocks, but is more\r\ngenerally budded on the peach. It is usually productive wherever peaches\r\nflourish, if not destroyed by the curculio. It is even more important\r\nthan in the peach to head-in the trees often, to produce good large\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n_Varieties_--are divided into freestone and clingstone, with quite a\r\nnumber in each class. We give only a few of those most esteemed.\r\n\r\n_Boston._--Freestone, American seedling; hardy and productive; color\r\ndeep-yellow, with a bright-red cheek. Time, September 1st.\r\n\r\n_Due du Telliers._--Freestone, pale-green, with a marbled reddish cheek;\r\nflesh whitish, inclining to green; very fine; a great bearer of rather\r\nlarge fruit. Time, last of August.\r\n\r\n_Hunt's Tawny._--Very fine and early; a great bearer; tree hardy; color,\r\npale-orange, with a dark-red cheek, with many russety specks. Time,\r\nforepart of August.\r\n\r\n_Pitmaston Orange._--A fine yellow nectarine, maturing the last of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n_The Early Violet_--is an old French variety, everywhere esteemed; it\r\nhas sixteen synonyms; fruit high-flavored. Time, last of August.\r\n\r\n_Newington._--A good clingstone; an English variety that has long been\r\ncultivated; it has many synonyms; the color dark-red when exposed. Time,\r\n10th of September.\r\n\r\n_Newington Early_--Is one of the best, earlier, larger, and better, than\r\nthe preceding; ripens first of September. The same varieties are\r\nexcellent for the South, where they ripen considerably earlier. The\r\nfollowing selection of choice, hardy nectarines for a small garden, is\r\nfrom Downing:--\r\n\r\nEarly Violet, Elruge, Hardwicke Seedling, Hunt's Tawny, Boston, Roman,\r\nand New White.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW FRUITS.\r\n\r\nThat these are constantly appearing, is a matter of common observation;\r\nbut the manner of their production has given rise to much diversity of\r\nopinion. The theory that they are the results of replanting, from the\r\nseeds of successive generations of the same tree, is called the Van\r\nMons' theory, after Dr. Van Mons, of Belgium, who devoted many years of\r\nclose study and application to the improvement of fruit, especially of\r\npears, by this method. His directions may be briefly summed up as\r\nfollows. Plant seeds from any good variety of fruit; let those seedlings\r\nstand without grafting, until they bear. Take the first fruit from the\r\nbest of those seedlings, and plant it and produce other seedlings, and\r\nso on. The peach and plum are said to reach a high state of excellence\r\nin the third generation, while the pear requires the fifth. Seeds from\r\nold trees are said to have a great tendency to return to their wild\r\norigin, while those of young, improving trees will more generally\r\nproduce a better fruit. The seeds from a graft from a young tree does\r\nnot produce a better than itself. The succession must be of seedlings.\r\nThis theory requires long practice, and is exposed to interruptions by\r\nthe crosses that will necessarily occur between different trees in\r\nblossom. And we have in so many cases had a fruit of great perfection\r\narise from a single planting of seed from some known variety, that we\r\nmust conclude the improvement to be produced by some other principle\r\nthan that of the Van Mons' theory. The evidence is in favor of the\r\nopinion that new varieties of fruit arise from cross-fertilization in\r\nthe blossoms of different kinds, and that the improvement of the\r\nqualities of any given variety is the result of cultivation. Some of the\r\nbest plums we have are known to have been the product of fertilizing the\r\nblossoms of one tree from the pollen of another; this is constantly\r\ntaking place with our fruits, and is consequent upon our mixed orchards.\r\nLet this be attended to artificially, by covering branches with gauze,\r\nto prevent the fertilization by bees and winds, and make the cross\r\nbetween any two varieties you choose, and the results may prove highly\r\nbeneficial. The amateur cultivator may render essential service to\r\npomology by this practice. We know that all our choice fruits have come\r\nfrom those not fit for use. It is not improved cultivation of the old,\r\nbarely, but the production of new varieties. The subject of further\r\nimprovement, therefore, demands careful study and practice. The seeds of\r\nestablished varieties, planted at once without drying, will often\r\nreproduce the same. We are not certain but they generally would, if not\r\naffected by blossoms of contiguous trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSERY.\r\n\r\nOf this subject we can only give the general outlines. This department\r\nof soil-culture is so distinct, that the few who engage in it as a\r\nbusiness are expected to make it an especial study. In a work like this,\r\nit is only desirable to give those general principles that will enable\r\nthe cultivator of the soil to raise such trees as he may desire on his\r\nown premises. These directions may be considered reliable, and, as far\r\nas they go, are applicable to all nurseries.\r\n\r\n_Location._--This is the first point demanding attention. If a piece of\r\nland containing a variety of soils can be selected, it will prove\r\nbeneficial, as different trees require different soils for their\r\ngreatest perfection. A situation through which a rivulet may run, or in\r\nwhich a pond may be constructed, fed by a spring or hydrant, is of great\r\nvalue for watering. The situation of the nursery, as it respects shade\r\nor exposure, is also important. Trees should generally be as much\r\nexposed to the elements, in the nursery, as they will be when\r\ntransplanted in the orchard. Trees removed from shaded situations to the\r\nopen field will be stinted in growth for some time, and may be\r\npermanently injured. Never allow your nursery to be shaded by large\r\ntrees. Bearing trees, designed to show the quality of your fruit, should\r\noccupy a place by themselves.\r\n\r\n_Soil._--A theory that has had many adherents is that trees raised on\r\npoorer and harder land than that they will occupy in the orchard, will\r\ngrow more vigorously, and do better, than those transplanted from better\r\nto worse soil. Thus, trees have often been preferred from high, hard\r\nhills, to transplant in good loam or alluvium. On the same principle, a\r\ncalf or colt should be more healthy, and make a better creature, for\r\nhaving been nearly starved for the first year or two. Neither of these\r\nis true. Give fruit-trees as great a growth as possible while young,\r\nwithout producing too tender and spongy wood for cold winters. It is\r\nonly desirable to check the early growth of fruit-trees on the rich\r\nprairies of the West, and that should be done, not by the poverty of the\r\nsoil, but by root-pruning or heading-in; this prevents a spongy, tender\r\ngrowth, that is apt to be injured by their trying winds. Trees that are\r\nbrought from a colder to a warmer region, always do better.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Soil._--It should be made quite rich with\r\nstable-manure, lime, and wood-ashes, and cultivated in a root-crop the\r\nprevious year--any roots except potatoes. Those left in the ground will\r\ncome up so early and vigorous in the spring, that you can not eradicate\r\nthem without destroying many of your young seedlings. The land should be\r\nworked very deep by subsoiling, or better with double-plowing, by which\r\nthe manure and top-soil are put in the bottom. As manure always works\r\nup, the effect will be excellent. Buckwheat is good to precede a\r\nnursery; it shades the ground so densely as to protect it from the\r\nscorching sun, and effectually destroy all weeds. Trees planted on land\r\nprepared by double-plowing (see our article on \"Plowing\") will make one\r\nthird greater growth, in a given time, than those on land prepared in\r\nthe ordinary way. In double-plowing, if the subsoil be very poor, it\r\nwill be necessary to give a top-dressing of well-rotted manure, worked\r\nin with a cultivator. Thorough draining is also very essential to a\r\nnursery.\r\n\r\n_Time of Planting._--The general practice is to plant in the fall, at\r\nany time before the ground freezes. The better way is to keep seeds in\r\nmoist sand, or dry and spread thin, until spring, and plant as early as\r\nthe ground will allow. Freezing apple-seeds is of no use. Hard-shelled\r\nseeds had better be frozen, to open the stones and give them an\r\nopportunity to germinate. The advantage of spring-planting is, the\r\nground can be put in much better condition, and the seeds will start\r\nquite as early as the weeds, and much labor may be saved in tending.\r\n\r\n_Method of Planting._--Plant with a drill that will run about an inch\r\ndeep, putting the seeds in straight rows, not more than an inch wide,\r\nand two and a half feet apart; this will allow the use of a small horse\r\nand cultivator, which will destroy nearly all the weeds. Use a\r\npotato-fork or hoe, across the rows, among the seedlings, and very\r\nlittle weeding will be necessary. It is not more than one fourth of the\r\nordinary work to keep a nursery clean in this way. Two thirds of those\r\nthus planted and cultivated will be large enough for root-grafting the\r\nfirst season, and for cleft-grafting the second. When your seedlings are\r\nsix inches high, if you thoroughly mulch them with fine straw or manure,\r\nyou will be troubled with no more weeds, and your trees will get a\r\nstrong growth.\r\n\r\nFor root-grafting, pull up those of suitable size very late in the fall,\r\ncut off the tops eight inches from the root, and pack in boxes, in moist\r\nsand, and keep in a cellar that does not freeze; graft in winter, and\r\nrepack them in the boxes with moist sand, sawdust, or moss, and keep\r\nthem until time to transplant in spring. They should not be wet, but\r\nonly slightly moist. In the spring, plant them in rows three feet apart,\r\nand ten inches in the row. The second year, if they are not wanted in\r\nmarket, they should be taken up and reset, in rows four feet apart, and\r\ntwo feet in the row. Cut off the ends of large roots, to encourage the\r\ngrowth of numerous fibrous roots. Large nursery-trees, that have not\r\nbeen transplanted, are of little value for the orchard, being nearly\r\ndestitute of fibrous roots. But large trees, even of bearing size, when\r\ntransplanted in the orchard, do quite as well as small ones, provided\r\nthey have been several times transplanted in the nursery. This produces\r\nmany fibrous roots, upon which the health and life of the tree depend.\r\n\r\nIn many regions, great care must be taken to prevent destruction of\r\nyoung trees by snow-drifts. This is done by selecting locations, and by\r\nconstructing or removing fences, to allow the snow to blow off; treading\r\nit down as it falls is also very useful, both in protecting the trees\r\nfrom breaking down by the settling of drifts in a thaw, and from the\r\ndepredations of mice under the snow.\r\n\r\nTrees should be taken up from the nursery with the least possible injury\r\nto the roots. Do not leave them exposed to the air for an hour, not even\r\nin a cloudy day. It is an easy matter to cover the roots with mats,\r\nstraw, or earth. Protect also from frosts; many trees are ruined by\r\nexposure to air and frost, of which the nurseryman is very careful in\r\nall other respects. For transportation, they should be closely packed in\r\nmoist straw, and wound in straw or mats, firmly tied and kept moist.\r\nTrees, cared for and packed in this way, may be transported thousands of\r\nmiles, and kept for two months, without injury.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUTS.\r\n\r\nMore attention to the cultivation of nuts, would add materially to our\r\ndomestic luxuries. There are so many nuts in market, that are the\r\nspontaneous productions of other countries, or raised where labor is\r\ncheap, that we can not afford to raise them as an article of commerce.\r\nBut a few trees of the various kinds, would be a great addition to every\r\ncountry residence. We could always be certain that our nuts were fresh\r\nand good. A small piece of ground devoted to nuts, and occupied by\r\nfowls, would be pleasant and profitable. English walnuts do well here.\r\nWe have varieties of hickory nuts, native in this country, which, to our\r\ntaste, are not surpassed by any other. Chestnuts are easily grown here\r\n(see our directions elsewhere in this volume). Butternuts, filberts,\r\npeanuts (growing in the ground like potatoes), and even our little\r\nforest beechnuts, are easily raised.\r\n\r\nThe dwarf chestnut of the Middle and Southern states is decidedly\r\nornamental in a fruit garden. Its qualities are in all respects like the\r\ncommon chestnut, only the fruit is but half the size, and the tree grows\r\nfrom five to ten feet high. In all our landscape gardens, and in all\r\nplaces where we retain forest trees for ornamental purposes, it is\r\nbetter to cultivate trees that will bear good nuts. The varieties of\r\nnut-bearing trees, interspersed with evergreens, make a beautiful\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nOAKS.\r\n\r\nRaising oak-timber, on a large scale, will soon be demanded in this\r\ncountry. In some sections we have immense quantities of native oaks; but\r\nthey are fast disappearing, and the present expense of transporting the\r\ntimber, to places where it is needed, is much greater than would be the\r\ncost of raising it. A million of acres of oaks ought to be planted\r\nwithin the next five years. A crop of white oak, of only twenty-five\r\nyears' growth, would be very valuable; and twenty-five or fifty acres,\r\nof forty years' growth, would be worth a handsome fortune, especially in\r\nthe West. On all the bluffs in the West they grow well, and on the\r\nprairies they will do even better, after they have been cultivated a few\r\nyears. The application of a little common salt on rich alluvial soils,\r\nis a great advantage in growing timber.\r\n\r\nPreserve acorns in moist sand during winter, and plant in the spring, in\r\nrows six feet apart, to give opportunity for other crops among them for\r\na year or two, to encourage good cultivation. Plant a foot apart in the\r\nrow, that, in thinning out, good straight trees may be left; at three or\r\nfour years old, thin to four feet in the rows; afterward, only remove as\r\nappears absolutely necessary. Trim straight and smooth. The question of\r\ntransplanting is important. Shall we plant thick, as in a nursery, and\r\nthen transplant, or shall we plant where they are to grow? In\r\nfruit-trees, the object is to get a low, full, and spreading top, of\r\nhorizontal branches, that will bear much fruit. This is eminently\r\npromoted by transplanting, root-pruning, and heading-in. But in raising\r\ntimber, the object is to get trees of long, straight bodies, with the\r\nfewest possible low branches. Such are the native trees of the forest.\r\nThis is best promoted by planting thick, never transplanting, and\r\nkeeping all the lower limbs well trimmed off. These directions are for\r\nraising timber on good tillable land. Such groves may be good for\r\npastures, and for poultry-yards, for a long time. Beside this, we have\r\nlarge areas of rough land, that will not soon be brought into\r\ncultivation for other purposes. Fine timber may be grown on such land,\r\nwith no care but trimming.\r\n\r\n\r\nOATS.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the great staple agricultural products of all regions,\r\nsufficiently moist and cool for their successful growth. Oatmeal makes\r\nthe most wholesome bread ever eaten by man. For all horses, except those\r\nhaving the heaves, oats are the best grain; to such horses they should\r\nnever be fed--corn, soaked or ground, is best. They are valuable for all\r\ndomestic animals and fowls.\r\n\r\n_Varieties._--These are numerous. Those called side-oats yield the\r\nlargest crops: but of these there are several varieties. The genuine\r\n_Siberian_ oats are tall, heavy, dark-colored side-oats, the most\r\nproductive of any known. _Swedish_ oats, and other new varieties, are\r\ncoming into notice; most of these are the Siberian, under other names,\r\nand perhaps slightly modified by location and culture. The barley-oats,\r\nScotch oats, and those usually cultivated, will yield only about two\r\nthirds as much per acre as the true Siberian; the same difference is\r\napparent in the growth of straw. Oats will produce something on poor\r\nland, with bad tillage, but repay thorough fertilization and tillage as\r\nwell as most other crops. Enrich the land, work it deep and thoroughly,\r\nand roll after harrowing. Moist, cool situations are much preferable for\r\noats: hence, success in warm climates depends upon very early sowing.\r\nOats sowed as late as the first of July, in latitude forty-two and\r\nfurther north, will mature; yet, all late oats, even with large straw\r\nand handsome heads, will be found to be only from one half to two thirds\r\nfilled in proportion to the lateness of sowing. The entire _profits_ of\r\nan oat-crop depend upon _early sowing_.\r\n\r\nHarvest as soon as the grain begins to harden, and the straw to turn\r\nyellow. Allowed to get quite ripe, they shell badly, and the straw\r\nbecomes useless, except for manure. Cut with reaper or cradle, and bind:\r\nall grain so cut is more easily handled, thrashed, and fed. Mow no grain\r\nthat is not so lodged down that a cradle or reaper can not be used. The\r\nstraw of oats cut quite green is nearly as good as hay.\r\n\r\n\r\nOKRA.\r\n\r\nA valuable garden plant, easily propagated by seeds. It is excellent in\r\ncookery, as a sauce. Its ripe seeds, used as coffee, very much resemble\r\nthe genuine article. The green pods are much used in the West Indies, in\r\nsoups and pickles. Plant at the usual time of corn-planting, in rows\r\nfour feet apart, two or three seeds in a place, eight inches apart in\r\nthe row; leave but one in a place after they get a few inches high, and\r\nhoe as peas, and the crop will be abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLIVES.\r\n\r\nThese are natives of Asia, but have, beyond date, been extensively\r\ncultivated in Southern Europe. Olive-oil is an important article of\r\ncommerce in most countries. Its use in all kinds of cookery, in\r\ncountries where it flourishes, renders olives as important, to the mass\r\nof the people, as cows are in New England. It should be a staple product\r\nof the Southern states, to which it is eminently adapted. It is hardy\r\nfurther north than the orange. With protection, it may be cultivated,\r\nwith the orange and lemon, all over the country. Olive-trees attain a\r\ngreater age than any other fruit-tree. An Italian olive-plantation, near\r\nTerni, is believed to have stood since the days of Pliny. Once set out,\r\nthe trees require very little attention, and they flourish well on the\r\nmost rocky lands, that are utterly useless for any other purpose.\r\nCalcareous soils are most favorable to their growth. They are propagated\r\nby suckers, seeds, or by little eggs that grow on the main stalk, and\r\nare easily detached by a knife, and planted as potatoes or corn. Olives\r\nwill bear at four or five years from the seed; they bear with great\r\nregularity, and yield fifteen or twenty pounds of oil per annum to each\r\ntree. There are several varieties. Plantations now growing at the South\r\nare very promising.\r\n\r\n\r\nONIONS.\r\n\r\nOf this well-known garden vegetable there are quite a number of\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n1. _The Large Red._--One of the most valuable.\r\n\r\n2. _The Yellow._--Large and profitable, keeping better than any other.\r\n\r\n3. _The Silver-skin._--The handsomest variety, excellent for pickling,\r\nbrings the highest price of all, but is not quite so good a keeper as\r\nthe red or yellow, and does not yield as well.\r\n\r\n4. _The White Portugal._--A larger white onion, often taken for the true\r\nsilver-skin. It is a good variety. The preceding are all raised from the\r\nblack seed, growing on the top.\r\n\r\n5. _The Egg Onion._--So called from its size and shape. On good rich\r\nsoil, the average size may be that of a goose-egg, which it resembles in\r\nform. It is of a pale-red color, and more mild in flavor than any other.\r\nThey are usually raised by sowing the black seed, very thick, to form\r\nsets for next year. Those sets, put out early, will form large onions\r\nfor early market, that will sell more readily than any other offered.\r\n\r\n6. _The Top Onion._--So called because the seed consists of small\r\nonions, growing on the top of the stalks, in place of the black seed of\r\nother onions. These are good for early use, grow large, but are poor\r\nkeepers.\r\n\r\n7. _The Hill or Potato Onion_.--Of these there are several kinds, most\r\nof which are unworthy of cultivation. The _Large English_ is the only\r\nvaluable variety. The small onions, for sets, grow in the ground from\r\nthe same roots, by the side of the main onion. Some of these grow large\r\nenough for cooking. The main onion is the earliest known, grows large,\r\nand has a mild, pleasant flavor;--they will mature at a certain season,\r\nwhatever time you plant them; hence, they must be planted very early to\r\nproduce a good crop. We have planted them on good ground so late as to\r\nget little more than the seed. They are fine for summer and fall use,\r\nbut keep poorly. The foregoing are all that are necessary. They can all\r\nbe brought forward by early planting of sets raised the previous season,\r\nby sowing the black seed so thick that they can not grow larger than\r\npeas, or small cherries.\r\n\r\nGood sandy loam and black muck are the best soils for onions. Any good\r\ngarden soil may be made to produce large crops; good, well rotted\r\nstable-manure and leached ashes are the best. The theory of shallow\r\nplowing, and treading down onion-beds is incorrect. The roots of onions\r\nare numerous and long. The land should be well-manured, double-plowed,\r\nand thoroughly pulverized. The only objection to a very mellow onion-bed\r\nis the difficulty of getting the seed up: this is obviated by rolling\r\nafter sowing, which packs the mould around the seed, so as to retain\r\nmoisture and insure vegetation. Fine manure, mixed in the surface of the\r\nsoil for onions, is highly beneficial; on no other crop does manure on\r\nthe surface do so much good. Mulching the whole bed, as soon as the\r\nplants are large enough, is in the highest degree beneficial, both in\r\npromoting growth, and keeping down weeds. An onion-bed must be made very\r\nsmooth and level, to favor very early hoeing, without destroying the\r\nsmall plants. All root-crops that come up small, are tended with less\r\nthan half the expense, if the surface be made very smooth and level.\r\nNever divide your onion-ground into small beds, but sow the longest way,\r\nin straight narrow rows, eighteen inches apart, for convenience of\r\nweeding and hoeing. Cultivate while very young, and work the soil toward\r\nthe rows, so as to hill up the plants; this should be removed after they\r\nbegin to form large bulbs. Breaking down the tops to induce them to\r\nbottom, is a fallacy: it will lessen the crop. Rich soil, deep plowing,\r\nthorough pulverizing, early sowing, and frequent hoeings, will insure\r\nsuccess. Our system of double-plowing is the best for this crop. They\r\nwill do equally well, some say improve, for twenty years on the same\r\nbed. Work the tops into the soil where the plants grow. Let the rows be\r\nvery narrow and very straight, and you will save half the ordinary\r\nexpense of cultivation.\r\n\r\n_To gather and preserve well_, you should house them when very dry. A\r\nday's exposure to a warm autumn sun is very beneficial. Keep them in an\r\nopen barn or shed until there is danger of frost. A warm, damp cellar\r\nalways ruins them; keep them through winter in the coolest dry place\r\npossible, without severe freezing. Once freezing is not injurious, but\r\nfrequent freezing and thawing ruins them. They are very finely preserved\r\nbraided into strings and hung in a cool, dry room.\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGES.\r\n\r\nThis name covers a variety of species of the same general habits. It\r\nflourishes well on the coast of Florida, and all along the gulf of\r\nMexico. It will stand considerable freezing, if protected from sudden\r\nthawing. In southern Europe, they are grown abundantly by being\r\nprotected by a shed of boards. They may become perfectly hardy, as far\r\nnorth as Philadelphia. And by a thorough system of acclimation, and a\r\nlittle winter protection, they may be grown abundantly, in every state\r\nof the Union. The great enemy of the orange-tree is the scaled insect.\r\nIt has been very destructive in Florida. A certain remedy is said to\r\nhave been discovered in the _camomile_. Cultivate the plant under\r\norange-trees, and it will prevent their attacks. The herb hung up in\r\nthe trees, or the tree and foliage syringed with a decoction of it, will\r\neffectually destroy these insects. The orange is long-lived. A tree\r\ncalled \"The Grand Bourbon\" at Versailles was planted in 1421, and now,\r\nbeing 437 years old, is \"one of the largest and finest trees in France.\"\r\nThere are several varieties mentioned in the fruit books. The common\r\nSweet Orange, the Maltese, the Blood Red--very fine with red flesh. The\r\nMandarin Orange, an excellent little fruit from China. The St. Michael's\r\nis described as the finest of all oranges, and the tree the best bearer.\r\nOranges are propagated by budding, and cultivated much in the same way\r\nas the peach.\r\n\r\n\r\nORCHARDS.\r\n\r\nAn orchard is a plat of ground, large or small, occupied by trees for\r\nthe purpose of bearing fruit. The main directions for orchard culture,\r\nare given under the respective fruits. Any soil good for vegetables or\r\ngrains, is suitable for orchards. Any land where excessive moisture will\r\nnot stand, to the injury of the trees, may be adapted to any of the\r\nfruits. Set pears on the heaviest land, peaches on the lightest, and the\r\nother fruits on the intermediate qualities. Although peaches will do\r\nquite well on light soil, yet they do better on a rich deep loam, or\r\nalluvium. When it is desirable to set out an orchard on land originally\r\ntoo wet, a blind ditch must pass under each row, extending out of the\r\norchard, and the place where each tree is to stand, should be raised a\r\nfoot above the level around it.\r\n\r\n_The aspect_ is also important. A southern or eastern exposure is\r\npreferable, in all latitudes where the transitions from summer to\r\nwinter, and from winter to summer are so sudden as to allow but little\r\nalternate thawing and freezing. This would therefore be the rule in high\r\nlatitudes. In climates of long changeable springs, a northern or western\r\nexposure is better. Trees may be made to start and blossom later in the\r\nspring by snow and ice about them, well pressed down in winter, and\r\ncovered with straw. This will prevent the first warm weather from\r\nstarting the leaves and blossoms, and cause them to be a little later,\r\nbut surer and better.\r\n\r\n_Subsoiling_ ground for an orchard, is of great importance. Plant two\r\norchards, one on land that has been subsoiled very deep, and the other\r\nupon that plowed in the ordinary way, and for ten years the difference\r\nwill be discernable, as far as you can distinguish the trees in the two\r\norchards.\r\n\r\n_Manures_ of all kinds, are good for orchards, except coarse stable\r\nmanure, which should be composted. A bushel of fine charcoal, thoroughly\r\nmixed in the soil in which you set a fruit-tree, will exert a very\r\nbeneficial influence, for a dozen years.\r\n\r\nOrchards should be cultivated every alternate three successive years,\r\nand the rest of the time be kept in grass. Just about the trees, the\r\nground should be kept loose, and free from weeds and grass. This may be\r\ndone by spading and hoeing, but better by thorough mulching.\r\n\r\n_Distances apart._--Apples thirty-three feet. Pears twenty feet. Peaches\r\nand plums, sixteen feet. Pruning, destroying insects, and all other\r\nmatters bearing on successful fruit growing, are treated under the\r\nseveral fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXEN.\r\n\r\nEvery farmer who can afford to keep two teams, should have a pair of\r\noxen. For many uses on a farm, they are preferable to horses; especially\r\nfor clearing up new land. Oxen to be most valuable, should be large,\r\nwell matched, ruly, and not very fat. They should be kept in good heart,\r\nby the quality of their food. Fast walking is one of the best qualities\r\nin both horses and oxen, for all working purposes, provided they are\r\njudiciously used and not overloaded. Well built, strong animals are best\r\nfor work. Working oxen should be turned out for beef, at eight or nine\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\n_To break oxen well_, commence when they are very young. Put calves into\r\nyokes frequently, until they will readily yield to your wishes. Yoke\r\nthem often, and tie their tails together to prevent them from turning\r\nthe yoke and injuring themselves. If left without training, until they\r\nare three or four years old, they will improve every opportunity to run\r\naway, to the danger and damage of proprietor and driver. It is quite an\r\nart to learn oxen to back a load. Place them before a vehicle, in a\r\nlocality descending in the rear. As it rolls down hill, they will easily\r\nlearn to follow, backward. Then try them on level ground. Then accustom\r\nthem to back up hill, and finally to back a load, almost as heavy as\r\nthey can draw.\r\n\r\nBreaking vicious animals is always best done by gentleness. We have\r\nknown vicious horses whipped severely, and in every way treated harshly,\r\nand finally given up as useless. We have seen those same horses, in\r\nother hands, brought to be regular, gentle, and safe, as could be\r\ndesired, by mild means, without a blow or harsh word. Oxen should be\r\ndriven in a low tone of voice, and without much use of the goad. The\r\nusual manner of driving, by whipping and bawling, to the annoyance of\r\nthe whole neighborhood, and until the driver becomes hoarse with his\r\nperpetual screams, is one of the most pernicious habits on a farm. Oxen\r\nwill grow lazy and insensible under threat, or scream, or goad. Driven\r\nin a low tone of voice, without confusion by rapid commands, and no whoa\r\nput in, unless you wish them to stand still, oxen may be made more\r\nuseful on a farm than horses. Their gears are cheap and never in the\r\nway. They can draw more and in worse places than horses, and it costs\r\nless to keep them. The various methods of drawing with head or horns, in\r\nvogue in other countries, need not be discussed here, as the American\r\npeople will not probably change their yoke and bows for any other\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nFeed oxen, as other animals, regularly, both in time and quantity. Curry\r\nthem often and thoroughly. It improves their looks, health, and temper,\r\nand attaches them to their owner.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARSLEY.\r\n\r\nThis is a hardy biennial, highly prized as a garnish, and as a pot-herb\r\nfor flavoring soups and boiled dishes. The large-rooted variety is used\r\nfor the table, as carrots or parsnips. The principal varieties are--the\r\n_double-curled_, the _dwarf-curled_, the _Siberian_ (single, very hardy,\r\nand fine-flavored), the _Hamburgh_ (large-rooted, used as an edible\r\nroot). The double-curled is well known, easily obtained, and suitable\r\nfor all purposes. Those who desire the roots instead of parsnips, &c.,\r\nshould cultivate the Hamburgh or large-rooted. It needs the same\r\ntreatment as beets. Seed should always be of the previous year's growth,\r\nor it may not vegetate. It is four or five weeks in coming up, unless it\r\nbe soaked twelve hours in a little sulphur-water, when it will vegetate\r\nin two weeks. By cutting the leaves close, even, and regular, a\r\nsuccession of fine leaves may be had for a whole year from the same\r\nplants, when they will go to seed, and new ones should take their place.\r\nIn cold climates they should be covered in winter with straw or litter.\r\nThe Siberian is cultivated in the field, sown with grass or the small\r\ngrains. It is said to prevent the disease called \"_the rot_\" in sheep,\r\nand is good for surfeited horses. The large-rooted should not be sowed\r\nin an excessively rich soil, as it produces an undue proportion of tops.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARSNIPS.\r\n\r\nEnglish authors speak of but one variety of this root in cultivation in\r\nEngland. The French have three--the _Coquaine_, the _Lisbonaise_, and\r\nthe _Siam_. The first runs down, in rich mellow soil, to the depth of\r\nfour feet, and grows from six to sixteen inches in circumference; the\r\nLisbonaise is shorter and larger round; the Siam is smaller than the\r\nothers, of a yellowish color, and of excellent quality. We are not aware\r\nthat our little hollow-crown carrot, so early and good, is included in\r\nthe French varieties. We cultivate only the hollow-crown, and a common\r\nlarge variety; both are good for the table, and as food for animals.\r\nThey need a light, deep, rich soil. A sandy loam is best, as for all\r\nroots. Seed kept over one season seldom vegetates. Should be soaked a\r\nday or two, and sown in straight rows, covered an inch deep, and the\r\nrows slightly rolled. It is much better, with this and the carrot, to\r\nsow radish-seed in the same rows. They come up so soon that they protect\r\nthe parsnips and carrots from too hot a sun while tender, and also serve\r\nto mark the rows, so that they may be hoed early, without danger of\r\ndestroying the young plants. Parsnips may be grown many years on the\r\nsame bed without deterioration, provided a little decomposed manure or\r\ncompost be annually added. Fresh manure is good if it be buried a foot\r\ndeep. The yield will be greater if thinned to eight inches apart. Rows\r\ntwo feet apart, and the plants six inches in the row, are most suitable\r\nin field-culture. They will grow till frost comes, and are better for\r\nthe table, when allowed to stand in the ground through the winter. They\r\nmay be dug and preserved as other roots. Parsnips contain more sugar\r\nthan any other edible root, and are therefore worth more per bushel for\r\nfood. All domestic animals and fowls fatten on them very rapidly, and\r\ntheir flesh is peculiarly pleasant. Fed to cows, they increase the\r\nquantity of milk, and impart a beautiful color and agreeable flavor to\r\nthe butter. It is superior to the beet, that we have so highly\r\nrecommended elsewhere, in all respects except one--it is less easily\r\ntended and harvested. Still, they should be cultivated on every farm\r\nwhere cattle, hogs, or fowls, are kept.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASTURES.\r\n\r\nThese are very important to all who keep domestic animals. The following\r\nbrief directions for successful pasturing are essential. It is very poor\r\neconomy to have all your pasture-lands in one field, or to put all your\r\nanimals together. Pasture fields in rotation, two weeks each, allowing\r\nrest and growth for six weeks: first horned cattle, next horses, then\r\nsheep. Horses feed closer than cattle, and sheep closer than horses;\r\neach also eats something that the others do not relish. Pasturing land\r\nwith sheep thickens the grass on the ground. For the kinds of grass\r\npreferable for pastures, see our article on _Grasses_. Plaster sown on\r\npastures containing clover, materially increases their growth. A little\r\nlime, plaster, and common salt, sown on any pasture, will prove very\r\nbeneficial. Streams or springs in pastures double their value. The idea\r\nthat creatures need no water when feeding on green grass is a mistake.\r\nEvery pasture without a spring or stream should have a well. Cattle in a\r\npasture in warm weather need shade. It is usual to advise the growth of\r\ntrees in the borders, or scattered over the whole field. Sheds are much\r\nbetter. Trees absorb the moisture, stint the growth of the grass, and\r\ninjure its quality. A pasture containing many trees is not worth more\r\nthan half price; it will keep about half as much stock, and keep them\r\npoorly. Bushes, which so often occupy pastures, should be grubbed up,\r\nand by all means destroyed; so should all thistles, briers, and large\r\nweeds. Hogs and geese should be kept in no pastures but their own. Never\r\nturn into pastures when the ground is very soft and wet, in the spring;\r\nthe tread of the creatures will destroy much of the turf. Creatures in\r\npasture should be salted twice a week. The age of grass, to make the\r\nbest feed for animals, is often mistaken: most suppose that young and\r\ntender grass is preferable; this is far from correct. Grass that is\r\nheaded out, and in which the seed has begun to mature, is far more\r\nnutritious, as every farmer can ascertain by easy experiments. Tall\r\ngrass, approaching maturity, will fatten cattle much faster than the\r\nmost tender young growth. Pasturing land enriches it. It is well to mow\r\npastures and pasture meadows occasionally, though few meadows and\r\npastures should lie long without plowing. Top-dressings of manure, on\r\nall grass-lands, are valuable; better applied in the fall than in the\r\nspring; evaporation is less, and it has opportunity to soak into the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAS.\r\n\r\nThese are sown in the field and garden. As a field-crop, peas and oats\r\nare sown together, and make good ground or soaked feed for horses, or\r\nfor fattening animals. Early peas and large marrowfats are frequently\r\nsown broadcast on rich, clean land, near large cities, to produce green\r\npeas for market. It does not pay as well as to sow in rows three feet\r\napart, and cultivate with a horse. All peas, for picking while green,\r\nare more convenient when bushed. They may produce nearly as well when\r\nallowed to grow in the natural way, but can not be picked as easily, and\r\nthe second crop is less, and inferior, from the injury to the vines by\r\nthe first picking. Early Kent peas (the best early variety) mature so\r\nnearly at the same time that the vines may be pulled up at once. All\r\nother peas had better be bushed, that they may be easily picked, and\r\nthat the later ones may mature. Bushes need not be set so close as\r\nusual. A good bush, put firmly in the ground, to enable it to resist the\r\nwind, once in two and a half feet, is quite sufficient. Those clinging\r\nto the bushes will hold up the others. To bush peas in this way is but\r\nlittle work, and pays well. It is often said that stable-manure does no\r\ngood on pea-ground---that peas are neither better nor more abundant for\r\nits use. We think this utterly a mistake. We have often raised twice the\r\nquantity on a row well manured, that grew on another row by its side,\r\nwhere no manure had been applied. If peas be sowed thick on\r\nthoroughly-manured land, the crop will be small: it is from this fact\r\nthat the idea has gained currency. They are generally planted too thick\r\non rich land. Peas planted six inches deep will produce nearly twice as\r\nmuch as those covered but an inch. Plowing in peas and leveling the\r\nsurface is one of the best methods of planting. To get an early crop in\r\na cold climate, they may be forced in hotbeds, or planted in a warm\r\nexposure, very early, and protected by covering, when the weather is\r\ncold. At the South, it is best to plant so as to secure a considerable\r\ngrowth in the fall, and protect by covering with straw during cold\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThe only known remedy for the bugs that are so common in peas, is late\r\nsowing. In latitude forty-two, peas sown as late as the 10th of June\r\nwill have no bugs. Bugs in seed-peas may be killed by putting the peas\r\ninto hot water for a quarter of a minute; plant immediately, and they\r\nwill come up sooner and do well. Seed imported from the more northern\r\nparts of Canada have no bugs; it is probably owing to the lateness of\r\nthe season of their growth. But late peas are often much injured by\r\nmildew; this is supposed to be caused by too little moisture in the\r\nground, and too much and too cool in the atmosphere, in dew or rain.\r\nLiberal watering then would prevent it.\r\n\r\n_Varieties_--are numerous. Two are quite sufficient. _Early Kent_ the\r\nearliest we have ever been able to obtain, ripen nearly all at once;\r\nmoderate bearers, but of the very best quality. This variety of pea is\r\nthe only garden vegetable with which we are acquainted that produces\r\nmore and better fruit for being sowed quite thick. The other variety\r\nthat we recommend is the _large Marrowfat_. These should not stand\r\nnearer together, on rich land, than three or four inches, and always be\r\nbushed. There are many other varieties of both late and early peas, but\r\nwe regard them inferior to these. White's \"Gardening for the South\"\r\nmentions Landreth's Extra Early, Prince Albert, Cedo-Nulli, Fairbank's\r\nChampion, Knight's tall Marrow, and New Mammoth. Whoever wishes a\r\ngreater variety can get any of these under new names. The large blue\r\nImperial is a rich pea, like many of the dwarfs, both of the large and\r\nsmall, but is very unproductive. We advise all to select the best they\r\ncan find, and plant but two kinds, late and early.\r\n\r\nPlant at intervals to get a succession of crops. But very late peas, in\r\nour dry climate, amount to but little, without almost daily watering.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACH.\r\n\r\nThis native of Persia is one of the most healthy and\r\nuniversally-favorite fruits. In its native state, it was hardly suitable\r\nfor eating, resembling an almond more than our present fine peaches.\r\nPerhaps no other fruit exhibits so wide a difference in the products of\r\nseeds from the same tree. All the fine varieties are what we call chance\r\nproducts of seeds, not one out of a thousand of which deserved further\r\ncultivation. The prevailing opinion is, that planting the seeds is not a\r\ncertain method of propagating a given variety; hence the general\r\npractice of budding (which see). Others assert that there are permanent\r\nvarieties, that usually produce the same from the seed, when not allowed\r\nto mix in the blossoms. Some prefer to raise the trees for their\r\npeach-orchards from seed, thinking them longer-lived and more healthy.\r\nWhole peaches planted when taken from the tree, or the pits planted\r\nbefore having become dry, are said to be much more certain to produce\r\nthe same fruit. We know an instance in which the fruit of an early\r\nCrawford peach, thus planted, could not be distinguished from those that\r\ngrew on a budded tree in the same orchard. One of the difficulties in\r\nreproducing the same from seed, is the great difficulty in getting the\r\nseed of any variety pure. We everywhere have so many varieties of\r\nfruit-trees in the same orchard, that the seeds of no one can be pure;\r\nthey mix in the blossoms. On this account, the surest method of\r\nperpetuating a variety is by budding. This tree is of rapid growth,\r\noften bearing the third year from the seed, and producing abundantly the\r\nfifth. The peach-tree is often called thrifty when its growth is very\r\nluxuriant, but tender and unhealthy, perishing in the following winter.\r\nA moderate, steady, hardy growth is most profitable. The following\r\ndirections, though brief, are complete:--\r\n\r\n_Raising Seedlings._--Dry the pits in the shade; put them away till the\r\nlast of winter; then soak them two days in water, and spread them on\r\nsome place in the garden where water will not stand, and cover them an\r\ninch deep with wet sand, and leave them to freeze. When about time to\r\nplant them (which is early corn-planting time), take them up and select\r\nall those that are opened by the frost, and that are beginning to\r\ngerminate, and plant in rows four feet apart and one foot in the row.\r\nThese will grow and be ready for budding considerably earlier than those\r\nnot opened by frost. Crack the others on a wooden block, by striking\r\ntheir side-edge with a hammer; you thus avoid injury to the germ that is\r\nendangered by striking the end. Plant these in rows like the others, but\r\nonly six inches apart in the row, as they will not all germinate. Plant\r\nthem on rich soil covering an inch or two deep. Keep them clear of\r\nweeds, and they will be ready for budding from August 15th to September\r\n10th, according to latitude or season. In a dry season, when everything\r\nmatures early, budding must not be deferred as long as in a wet season.\r\n\r\nFor full directions for budding, see our article on that subject.\r\n\r\n_Transplanting._--Perhaps no other fruit-tree suffers so much from\r\ntransplanting when too large. This should always be done, after one\r\nyear's growth, from the bud. The best time for transplanting is the\r\nspring in northern latitudes subject to hard frosts, and in autumn in\r\nwarmer climates.\r\n\r\n_Soil and Location._--All intelligent fruit-growers are aware that these\r\nexert a great influence upon the size, quality, and quantity, of all\r\nvarieties of fruits. An accurate description of a variety in one climate\r\nwill not always identify it in another. Some few varieties are nearly\r\npermanent and universal, but most are adapted to particular localities,\r\nand need a process of acclimation to adapt them to other soils and\r\nsituations. Light sandy soils are usually regarded best for the peach:\r\nit is only so because nineteen out of twenty cultivators will not take\r\npains to suitably prepare other soils. Some of the best peaches we have\r\never seen grew on the richest Illinois prairie, and others on the\r\nlimestone bluffs of the Ohio river. Thorough drainage is indispensable\r\nfor the peach, on all but very light, porous soils: with such drainage,\r\npeaches will do best on soil best adapted to growing corn and potatoes.\r\nBones, bonedust, lime, ashes, stable-manure, and charcoal, are the best\r\napplications to the soil of a peach-orchard. Whoever grows peaches\r\nshould put at least half a bushel of fine charcoal in the earth in which\r\nhe sets each tree. Mix it well with the soil, and the tree will grow\r\nbetter, and the fruit be larger and finer, for a dozen years. Any good\r\nsoil, well drained and manured with these articles, will produce great\r\ncrops of peaches. For the location of peach-orchards, see our general\r\nremarks on \"Location of Fruit-trees.\" But we would repeat here the\r\ndirection to choose a northern exposure, in climates subject to late\r\nfrosts. Elevations are always favorable, as are also the shores of all\r\nbodies of water. In our remarks on location, we have shown by facts the\r\ngreat value of hills, so high as to be useless for any other purpose.\r\nBetween Pittsburgh and the mouth of the Ohio river, there are enough\r\nhigh elevations, now useless, to supply all the cities within fifty\r\nmiles of the rivers, down to New Orleans, with the best of peaches every\r\nyear. In no year will they ever be cut off by frost on those hills. Warm\r\nexposures, with a little winter protection, will secure good peaches in\r\nclimates not adapted to them. In some parts of France, they grow large\r\nquantities for market by training them against walls, where they do not\r\nflourish in the open field. By this practice, and by enclosures and\r\nacclimation, the growth of this excellent fruit may be extended to the\r\ncoldest parts of the United States.\r\n\r\n_Transplanting_--should be performed with care, as in the case of all\r\nother fruit-trees. Every injured root should be cut off smooth from the\r\nunder side, slanting out from the tree. Leave the roots, as nearly as\r\npossible, in the position in which they were before. Set the tree an\r\ninch lower than it stood in the nursery; it saves the danger of the\r\nroots getting uncovered, and of too strong action of the atmosphere on\r\nthe roots, in a soil so loose. The opposite is often recommended, viz.,\r\nto allow the tree in its new location to stand an inch or two higher\r\nthan before; but we are sure, from repeated trials, that it is wrong.\r\nShake the fine earth as closely around the roots as possible, mulch\r\nwell, and pour on a pailful of tepid water, if it be rather a dry time,\r\nand the tree will be sure to live and make a good growth the first year.\r\nWhen a peach-tree is transplanted, after one year's growth from the bud,\r\nit should have the top cut off within eighteen inches or two feet of the\r\nground, and all the limbs cut off at half their length. This will\r\ninduce the formation of a full, large head. A low, full-branching head\r\nis always best on a peach-tree.\r\n\r\n_Pruning_ is perhaps the most important matter in successful peach\r\nculture. The fruit is borne wholly on wood of the previous year's\r\ngrowth. Hence a tree that has the most of that growth, in a mature\r\nstate, and properly situated, will bear the most and the finest fruit. A\r\ntree left to its natural state, with no pruning but of a few of the\r\nlower limbs from the main trunk, will soon exhibit a collection of long\r\nnaked limbs, without foliage, except near their extremities (see the cut\r\noverleaf). In this case fruit will be too thick on what little bearing\r\nwood there is, and it should be thinned. But very few cultivators even\r\nattend to that. The fruit is consequently small, and it weakens the\r\ngrowth of the young wood above, for next year's fruiting, and thus tree\r\nand fruit are perpetually deteriorating.\r\n\r\nObserve a shoot of young peachwood, you will see near its base,\r\nleaf-buds. On the middle there are many blossom-buds, and on the top,\r\nleaf-buds again. The tendency of sap is to the extremity. Hence the\r\nupper leaf-buds will put out at once. And for their growth, and the\r\nmaturity of the excessive fruit on the middle, the power of the sap is\r\nso far exhausted, that the leaf-buds at the base do not grow. Hence when\r\nthe fruit is removed, nothing is left below the terminal shoots, but a\r\nbare pole. This is the condition in which we find most peach-trees.\r\n\r\nFor this there is a certain preventive. It consists in shortening in, by\r\ncutting off in the month of September, from a third to a half of the\r\ncurrent season's growth. If the top be large, cut off one half the\r\nlength of the new wood. If it be less vigorous and rank, and you fear\r\nyou will not have room for a fair crop of peaches, cut off but one\r\nthird. This heading-in is sometimes recommended to be done in the\r\nspring. For forming a head in a young tree the spring is better. But to\r\nmature the wood, and increase the quantity, and improve the quality of\r\nthe fruit, September is much the best.\r\n\r\nSuch shortening in early in September, directs the sap to maturing the\r\nwood, already formed and developing fruit-buds, instead of promoting the\r\ngrowth of an undue quantity of young and tender wood, to be destroyed by\r\nthe winter, or to hinder the growth of the fruit of the next season.\r\nThis heading-in process, with these young shoots, is most easily\r\nperformed with pruning shears, with wooden handles, of a length suited\r\nto the height of the tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Neglected Peach-Tree.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Properly-trimmed Peach-Tree.]\r\n\r\nBut a work to precede this annual shortening-in, is the original\r\nformation of a head to a peach-tree. Take a tree a year old from the\r\nbud, and cut it down to within two and a half feet from the ground.\r\nBelow that numerous strong shoots will come out. Select three vigorous\r\nones and let them grow as they please, carefully pinching off all the\r\nrest. In the fall you will have a tree of three good strong branches. In\r\nthe next spring cut off these three branches, one half. Below these\r\ncuts, branches will start freely. Select one vigorous shoot to continue\r\nthe limb, and another to form a new branch. Check the growth of the\r\nshoots below, by cutting off their ends, but do not rub them off, as\r\nthey will form fruit branches. At the close of the season you will have\r\na tree with six main branches, and some small ones for fruit, on the\r\nolder wood. Repeat this process the third year, and you have a tree with\r\ntwelve main branches, and plenty smaller ones for fruit. All these small\r\nbranches on the old wood, should be shortened in half their length, to\r\ncause the leaf-buds near their base to start, so as to produce large\r\nnumbers of young shoots. Continue this as long as you please, and make\r\njust as large a head and just such a form as you may wish, being careful\r\nonly to control the shape of the top so as to let the sun and air freely\r\ninto every part.\r\n\r\nTrees thus trained may be planted thick enough to allow four hundred to\r\nstand on an acre, and will bear an abundance of the finest fruit, and\r\nall low enough to be easily picked. This method of training is much\r\nbetter than allowing the tree to shoot out on all sides from the ground:\r\nin that case, the branches are apt to split down and perish. This system\r\nof heading-in freely every year, preserves the life and health of the\r\ntree remarkably. Many of the finest peach-trees in France are from\r\nthirty to sixty years old, and some a hundred. We may, in this country,\r\nhave peach-trees live fifty years, in the most healthy bearing\r\ncondition. By trimming in this way, and carrying out fully this system,\r\nsome have thrifty-looking peach-trees, more than a foot in diameter,\r\nbearing the very best of fruit. It is sheer neglect that causes our\r\npeach-orchards to perish after having borne from three to six years. Let\r\nevery man who plants a peach-tree remember, that this system of\r\ntraining will make his tree live long, be healthy, grow vigorously, and\r\nbear abundantly.\r\n\r\n_Diseases_ of peach-trees have been a matter of much speculation. The\r\nresult is, that the hope of the peach-grower is mainly in preventives.\r\n\r\n_The Yellows_ is usually regarded as a disease. Imagination has invented\r\nmany causes of this evil. Some suppose it to be produced by small\r\ninsects; others that it is in the seed. Again, it is ascribed to the\r\natmosphere. It has been supposed to be propagated in many ways--by\r\ntrimming a healthy tree with a knife that had been used on a diseased\r\none; by contagion in the atmostphere, as the measles or small-pox; by\r\nimpregnation from the pollen, through the agency of winds or bees; by\r\nthe migration of small insects; or by planting diseased seeds, or\r\nbudding from diseased trees. This great diversity of opinion leaves room\r\nto doubt whether the yellows in peach-trees be a disease at all, or only\r\na symptom of general decay. The symptoms, as given in all the\r\nfruit-books, are only such as would be natural from decay and death of\r\nthe tree, from any cause whatever. This may result from neglect to\r\nsupply the soil with suitable manures, and to trim trees properly, and\r\nespecially from over-bearing. This view of the case is more probable,\r\nfrom the fact that none pretend to have found a remedy. All advise to\r\nremove the tree thus affected at once, root and branch. We have seen the\r\nfollowing treatment of such trees tried with marked success. Cut off a\r\nlarge share of the top, as when you would renew an old, neglected tree;\r\nlay the large roots bare, making a sort of basin around the body of the\r\ntree, and pour in three pailfuls of _boiling_ water: the tree will\r\nstart anew and do well. This is an excellent application to an old,\r\nfailing peach-tree. The sure preventive of the yellows is, planting\r\nseeds of healthy trees, budding from the most vigorous, heading-in well,\r\nsupplying appropriate manures, and general good cultivation.\r\n\r\n_Curled Leaves_ is another evil among peach-trees, occurring before the\r\nleaves are fully grown, and causing them to fall off after two or three\r\nweeks. Other leaves will put out, but the fruit is destroyed, and the\r\ngeneral health of the tree injured. Elliott says the curl of the leaf is\r\nproduced by the punctures of small insects. One kind of curled leaf is,\r\nbut not this. But we have no doubt that Barry's theory is the correct\r\none, viz., that it is the effect of sudden changes of the weather. We\r\nhave noticed the curled leaf in orchards where the trees were so close\r\ntogether as to guard each other. On the side where the cold wind struck\r\nthem, we noticed they were badly affected; while on the warm side, and\r\nin the centre where they were protected by the others, they exhibited\r\nvery few signs of the curl. In western New York, unusual cold east winds\r\nalways produce the curled leaves, on trees much exposed: hence, the only\r\nremedy is the best protection you can give, by location, &c.\r\n\r\n_Mildew_ is a minute fungus growing on the ends of tender shoots of\r\ncertain varieties, checking their growth, and producing other bad\r\neffects. Syringe the trees with a weak solution of nitre, one ounce in a\r\ngallon of water, which will destroy the fungus and invigorate the tree.\r\n\r\n_The Borer_ has been the great enemy of the peach-tree, since about the\r\nclose of the last century. The female insect, that produces the worms,\r\ndeposites her eggs under rough bark, near the surface of the ground.\r\nThis is done mostly in July, but occasionally from June to October. The\r\neggs are laid in small punctures, and covered with a greenish glue; in a\r\nfew days they come out, a small white worm, and eat through the bark\r\nwhere it is tender, just at, or a little below, the surface of the\r\nground; they eat under the bark, between that and the wood, and,\r\nconsuming a little of each, they frequently girdle the tree; as they\r\ngrow larger, they perforate the solid wood; when about a year old, they\r\nmake a cocoon just below the surface of the ground, change into a\r\nchrysalis state, and shortly come out a winged insect, to deposite fresh\r\neggs. But the practical part of all this is the _remedy_: keep the\r\nground clean around the trees, and rub off frequently all the rough\r\nbark; place around each tree half a peck of air-slaked lime, and the\r\nborer will not attack it. This should be placed there on the first of\r\nMay, and be spread over the ground on the first of October; refuse\r\ntobacco-stems, from the cigar-makers, or any other offensive substance,\r\nas hen-manure, salt and ashes, &c., will answer the same purpose. We\r\nshould recommend the annual cultivation of a small piece of ground in\r\ntobacco, for use around peach-trees. We have found it very successful\r\nagainst the borer, and it is an excellent manure; applied two or three\r\ntimes during the season, it proves a perfect remedy, and is in no way\r\ninjurious, as an excessive quantity of lime might be.\r\n\r\n_Leaf Insects._--There are several varieties, which cause the leaves to\r\ncurl and prematurely fall. This kind of curled leaf differs from the one\r\ndescribed as the result of sudden changes and cold wind; that appears\r\ngeneral wherever the cold wind strikes the tree, while this only affects\r\na few leaves occasionally, and those surrounded by healthy leaves. The\r\nremedy is to syringe them with offensive mixtures, as tobacco-juice, or\r\nsprinkle them when wet with fine, air-slaked lime.\r\n\r\n_Varieties._--Their name is legion, and they are rapidly increasing, and\r\ntheir synonyms multiplying. A singular fact, in most of our fruit-books,\r\nis a minute description of useless kinds, and such descriptions of those\r\nthat they call good, as not one in ten thousand cultivators will ever\r\ntry to master--they are worse than useless, except to an occasional\r\namateur cultivator.\r\n\r\nElliott, in his fruit-book, divides peaches into three classes: the\r\nfirst is for general cultivation; under this class he describes\r\nthirty-one varieties, with ninety-eight synonyms. His second class is\r\nfor amateur cultivators, and includes sixty-nine varieties, with\r\neighty-four synonyms. His third class, which he says are unworthy of\r\nfurther cultivation, describes fifty-four varieties, with seventy-seven\r\nsynonyms. Cole gives sixty-five varieties, minutely described, and many\r\nof them pronounced worthless. In Hooker's Western Fruit-Book, we have\r\nsome eighty varieties, only a few of which are regarded worthy of\r\ncultivation. Downing gives us one hundred and thirty-three varieties,\r\nwith about four hundred synonyms. In all these works the descriptions\r\nare minute. The varieties of serrated leaves, the glandless, and some\r\nhaving globose glands on the leaves, and others with reniform glands.\r\nThen we have the color of the fruit in the shade and in the sun, which\r\nwill, of course, vary with every degree of sun or shade. We submit the\r\nopinion that those books would have possessed much more value, had they\r\nonly described the best mode of cultivating peaches, without having\r\nmentioned a single variety, thus leaving each cultivator to select the\r\nbest he could find. Had they given a plain description of ten, or\r\ncertainly of not more than fifteen varieties, those books would have\r\nbeen far more valuable _for the people_. We give a small list, including\r\nall we think it best to cultivate. Perhaps confining our selection to\r\nhalf a dozen varieties would be a further improvement:--\r\n\r\n1. The first of all peaches is _Crawford's Early_. This is an early,\r\nsure, and great bearer, of the most beautiful, large fruit;--a\r\ngood-flavored, juicy peach, though not the very richest. It is, on the\r\nwhole, the very best peach in all parts of the country. Time, from July\r\n15th to September 1st. Freestone.\r\n\r\n2. _Crawford's Late_ is very large and handsome; uniformly productive,\r\nthough not nearly so good a bearer as Crawford's Early. Ripens last of\r\nSeptember and in October. Fair quality, and always handsome; freestone;\r\nexcellent for market.\r\n\r\n3. _Columbia._--Origin, New Jersey. It is a thoroughly-tested variety,\r\nraised and described by Mr. Cox, who wrote one of the earliest and best\r\nAmerican fruit-books. Fine specimens were exhibited in 1856, grown in\r\nCovington, Ky. Excellent in all parts of the United States. Freestone.\r\n\r\n4. _George the Fourth._--A large, delicious, freestone peach, an\r\nAmerican seedling from Mr. Gill, Broad street, New York. The National\r\nPomological Society have decided the tree to be so healthy and\r\nproductive as to adapt it to all localities in this country. It has\r\ntwenty-five synonyms.\r\n\r\n5. _Early York._--Freestone; the best, and first really good, early\r\npeach. Time July at Cincinnati, and August at Cleveland. Time of\r\nripening of all varieties varies with latitude, location, and season.\r\n\r\n6. _Grass Mignonne._--A foreign variety, a great favorite in France, in\r\nthe time of Louis XIV. Very rich freestone, flourishing in all climates\r\nfrom Boston south. The high repute in which it has long been held is\r\nseen in its thirty synonyms. One of the best, when you can obtain the\r\ngenuine. Time, August.\r\n\r\n7. _Honest John._--A large, beautiful, delicious, freestone variety.\r\nHighly prized as a late peach, maturing from the middle to the last of\r\nOctober. Indispensable in even a small selection.\r\n\r\n8. _Malacatune._--A very popular American freestone peach, derived from\r\na Spanish, and is the parent of the Crawford peaches, both early and\r\nlate.\r\n\r\n9. _Morris White._--Everywhere well known; a good bearer; best for\r\npreserving at the North; a good dessert peach South.\r\n\r\n10. _Morris Red Rare-ripe._--A favorite, freestone, July peach. The tree\r\nis healthy and a great bearer.\r\n\r\n11. _Old Mixon._--Should be found in all gardens and orchards; it is of\r\nexcellent quality and ripens at a time when few good peaches are to be\r\nhad; it endures spring-frosts better than any other variety; profitable.\r\n\r\n12. _Old Mixon Cling._--One of the most delicious early clingstones.\r\nDeserves a place in all gardens.\r\n\r\n13. _Monstrous Cling._--Not the best quality, but profitable for market\r\non account of its great size.\r\n\r\n14. _Heath Cling._--Very good South and West. Wrapped in paper and laid\r\nin a cool room, it will keep longer than any other variety. Tree hardy\r\nand often produces when others fail. Excellent for preserving, and when\r\nquite ripe, is superior as a dessert fruit.\r\n\r\n15. _Blood Cling._--A well-known peach, excellent for pickling and\r\npreserving. It sometimes measures twelve inches in circumference. The\r\nold French Blood Cling is smaller. Many of these varieties will be found\r\nunder other names. You will have to depend upon your nursery-man to give\r\nyou the best he has, and be careful to bud from any choice variety you\r\nmay happen to taste. Difficulties and disappointments will always attend\r\nefforts to get desired varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAR.\r\n\r\nThe pear is a native of Europe and Asia, and, in its natural state, is\r\nquite as unfit for the table as the crab-apple. Cultivation has given it\r\na degree of excellence that places it in the first rank among\r\ndessert-fruits. No other American fruit commands so high a price. New\r\nvarieties are obtained by seedlings, and are propagated by grafting and\r\nbudding: the latter is generally preferred. Root-grafting of pears is to\r\nbe avoided; the trees will be less vigorous and healthy. The difficulty\r\nof raising pear-seedlings has induced an extensive use of suckers, to\r\nthe great injury of pear-culture. Fruit-growers are nearly unanimous in\r\ndiscarding suckers as stocks for grafting. The difficulty in raising\r\nseedling pear-trees is the failure of the seeds to vegetate. A remedy\r\nfor this is, never to allow the seeds to become dry, after being taken\r\nfrom the fruit, until they are planted. Keep them in moist sand until\r\ntime to plant them in the spring, or plant as soon as taken from the\r\nfruit. The spring is the best time for planting, as the ground can be\r\nput in better condition, rendering after-culture much more easy. The\r\npear will succeed well on any good soil, well supplied with suitable\r\nfertilizers. The best manures for the pear are, lime in small\r\nquantities, wood-ashes, bones, potash dissolved, and applied in rotten\r\nwood, leaves, and muck, with a little stable-manure and\r\niron-filings--iron is very essential in the soil for the pear-tree. In\r\nall soils moderately supplied with these articles, all pear-trees\r\ngrafted on seedling-stocks, and those that flourish on the foreign\r\nquince, will do well. A good yellow loam is most natural; light sandy or\r\ngravelly land is unfavorable. It is better to cart two or three loads of\r\nsuitable soil for each tree on such land. The practice of budding or\r\ngrafting on apple-stocks, on crab-apples, and on the mountain-ash,\r\nshould be utterly discarded. For producing early fruit, quince-stocks\r\nand root-pruning are recommended.\r\n\r\nSetting out pear-trees properly is of very great importance. The\r\nrequisites are, to have the ground in good condition, from manure on the\r\ncrop of the last season, and thoroughly subsoiled and drained.\r\nPear-trees delight in rather heavy land, if it be well drained; but\r\nwater, standing in the soil about them, is utterly ruinous. Pear-trees,\r\nwell transplanted on moderately rich land, well subsoiled and well\r\ndrained, will almost always succeed. By observing the following brief\r\ndirections, any cultivator may have just such shaped tops on his\r\npear-trees as he desires. Cut short any shoots that are too vigorous,\r\nthat those around them may get their share of the sap, and thus be\r\nenabled to make a proportionate growth. After trees have come into\r\nbearing, symmetry in the form of their heads may be promoted by\r\npinching off all the fruit on the weak branches, and allowing all on the\r\nstrong ones to mature.\r\n\r\nThose two simple methods, removing the fruit from too vigorous shoots,\r\nand cutting in others, half or two-thirds their length, will enable one\r\nto form just such heads as he pleases, and will prove the best\r\npreventives of diseases.\r\n\r\n_Diseases._--There are many insects that infest pear-orchards, in the\r\nsame manner as they do apples, and are to be destroyed in the same way.\r\nThe slugs on the leaves are often quite annoying. These are worms,\r\nnearly half an inch long, olive-colored, and tapering from head to tail,\r\nlike a tadpole. Ashes or quicklime, sprinkled over the leaves when they\r\nare wet with dew or rain, is an effectual remedy.\r\n\r\n_Insect-Blight._--This has been confounded with the frozen-sap blight,\r\nthough they are very different. In early summer, when the shoots are in\r\nmost vigorous growth, you will notice that the leaves on the ends of\r\nbranches turn brown, and very soon die and become black. This is caused\r\nby a worm from an egg, deposited just behind or below a bud, by an\r\ninsect. The egg hatches, and the worm perforates the bark into the wood,\r\nand commits his depredations there, preventing the healthy flow of the\r\nsap, which kills the twig above. Soon after the shoot dies, the worm\r\ncomes out in the form of a winged insect, and seeks a location to\r\ndeposite its eggs, preparatory to new depredations. The remedy is to cut\r\noff the shoots affected at once, and burn them. The insect-blight does\r\nnot affect the tree far below the location of the worm. Watch your trees\r\nclosely, and cut off all affected parts as soon as they appear, and burn\r\nthem immediately, and you will soon destroy all the insects. But very\r\nsoon after the appearance of the blight they leave the limb; hence a\r\nlittle delay will render your efforts useless. These insects often\r\ncommit the same depredations on apple and quince-trees. We had an\r\norchard in Ohio seriously affected by them. We know no remedy but\r\ndestruction as above.\r\n\r\n_The Frozen-Sap Blight_ is a much more serious difficulty. Its nature\r\nand origin are now pretty well settled. In every tree there are two\r\ncurrents of sap: one passes up through the outer wood, to be digested by\r\nthe leaves; the other passing down in the inner bark, deposites new\r\nwood, to increase the size of the tree. Now, in a late growth of this\r\nkind of wood, the process is rapidly going on, at the approach of cold\r\nweather, and the descending sap is suddenly frozen, in this tender bark\r\nand growing wood. This sudden freezing poisons the sap, and renders the\r\ntree diseased. The blight will show itself, in its worst form, in the\r\nmost rapid growing season of early summer, though the disease commenced\r\nwith the severe frosts of the previous autumn. Its presence may be known\r\nby a thick, clammy sap, that will exude in winter or spring pruning, and\r\nin the discoloration of the inner bark and peth of the branches. On\r\nlimbs badly affected on one side, the bark will turn black and shrivel\r\nup. But its effects in the death of the branches only occur when the\r\ngrowth of the tree demands the rapid descent of the sap: then the\r\npoisoned sap which was arrested the previous fall, in its downward\r\npassage, is diluted and sent through the tree; and when it is abundant,\r\nthe whole tree is poisoned and destroyed in a few days; in others more\r\nslightly affected, it only destroys a limb or a small portion of the\r\ntop. Another effect of this fall-freezing of sap and growing wood, is\r\nto rupture the sap-vessels, and thus prevent the inner bark from\r\nperforming its functions. This theory is so well established, that an\r\nintelligent observer can predict, in the fall, a blight-season the\r\nfollowing summer. If the summer be cool, and the fall warm and damp,\r\nclosed by sudden cold, the blight will be troublesome the next season,\r\nbecause the plentiful downward flow of sap, and rapid growth of wood,\r\nwere arrested by sudden freezing. If the summer is favorable, and the\r\nwood matures well before cold weather, the blight will not appear. This\r\nis of the utmost practical moment to the pear-culturist. Anything in\r\nsoil, situation, or pruning, that favors early maturity of wood, will\r\nserve as a preventive of blight; hence, cool, moist situations are not\r\nfavorable in climates subject to sudden and severe cold weather in\r\nautumn. Root-pruning and heading-in, which always induce early maturity\r\nof wood, are of vast importance; they will, almost always, prevent\r\nfrozen-sap blight. If, in spite of you, your pear-trees will make a late\r\nluxuriant growth, cut off one half of the most vigorous shoots before\r\nhard freezing, and you will check the flow of sap, by removing the\r\nleaves and shoots that control it, and save your trees. If blight makes\r\nits appearance, cut off at once all the parts affected. The effects will\r\nbe visible in the wood and inner bark, far below the external apparent\r\ninjury. Remove the whole injured part, or it will poison the rest of the\r\ntree. When this frozen sap is extensive, it poisons and destroys the\r\nwhole tree; when slight, the tree often wholly recovers. If a spot of\r\nblack, shrivelled bark appears, shave it off, deep enough to remove the\r\naffected parts, and cover the wound with grafting-wax. Remove all\r\naffected limbs. These are the only remedies. But the practice of\r\npruning both roots and branches will prove a certain preventive. A tree\r\ngrowing in grass, where it grows more slowly, and matures earlier in the\r\nseason, will escape this blight; while one growing in very rich garden\r\nsoil, and continuing to grow until cold weather, will suffer severely.\r\nThe effects on orchards, in different soils and localities everywhere,\r\nconfirm this theory. A little care then will prevent this evil, which\r\nhas sometimes been so great as to discourage attempts at raising pears.\r\nIn some localities, some of the finer varieties of pears, as the\r\nvirgalieu, are ruined by cracking on the trees before ripening.\r\nApplications of ashes, salt, charcoal, iron-filings, and clay on light\r\nlands, will remedy this evil.\r\n\r\n_Distances apart._--All fruit-trees had better occupy as little ground\r\nas is consistent with a healthy vigorous growth. They are manured and\r\nwell cultivated, at a much less expense. The trees protect each other\r\nagainst inclement weather. The fruit is more easily harvested. And it is\r\na great saving of land, as nothing else can be profitably grown in an\r\norchard of large fruit-trees. The two kinds of pear-trees, dwarf and\r\nstandard, may be planted together closely and be profitable for early\r\nand abundant bearing. The plan given on the next page of a pear-orchard,\r\nrecommended in Cole's Fruit Book, is the best we have seen.\r\n\r\nIn the plan the trees on pear-stocks, designed for standards, occupy the\r\nlarge black spots where the lines intersect. They are thirty-three feet\r\napart. The small spots indicate the position of dwarf-trees on quince\r\nstocks. Of these there are three on each square rod. An acre then would\r\nhave forty standard trees, and four hundred and eighty dwarfs. The\r\nlatter will come into early bearing, and be profitable, long before the\r\nformer will produce any fruit. This will induce and repay thorough\r\ncultivation. They should be headed in, and finally removed, as the\r\nstandards need more room. One acre carefully cultivated in this way,\r\nwill afford an income sufficient for the support of a small family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of a Pear-Orchard.]\r\n\r\n_Gathering and Preserving._--Most fruits are better when allowed fully\r\nto ripen on the tree. But with pears, the reverse is true; most of them\r\nneed to be ripened in the house, and some of them, as much as possible,\r\nexcluded from the light. Gather when matured, and when a few of the\r\nwormy full-grown ones begin to fall, but while they adhere somewhat\r\nfirmly to the tree. Barrel or box them tight, or put them in drawers in\r\na cool dry place. About the time for them to become soft, put them in a\r\nroom, with a temperature comfortable for a sitting-room, and you will\r\nsoon have them in their greatest perfection. They do better in a warm\r\nroom, wrapped in paper or cotton. A few only ripen well on the trees.\r\nThose ripened in the house keep much longer and better.\r\n\r\n_Varieties._--The London Horticultural Society have proved seven hundred\r\nvarieties, from different parts of the world, in their experimental\r\ngarden. Cole speaks of eight hundred and Elliott of twelve hundred\r\nvarieties. There are now probably more than three thousand growing in\r\nthis country. Many seedlings, not known beyond the neighborhood where\r\nthey originated, may be among our very best. From six to ten varieties\r\nare all that need be cultivated. We present the following list, advising\r\ncultivators to select five or six to suit their own tastes and\r\ncircumstances, and cultivate no more. We do not give the usual\r\ndescriptions of the varieties selected. The mass of cultivators, for\r\nwhom this work is specially intended, will never learn and test the\r\ndescriptions. They will depend upon their nursery-man, and bud and graft\r\nfrom those they have tasted.\r\n\r\nWe give their names and some of their synonyms, their adaptation to\r\nquince or pear stocks, their manner of growth, and time of maturity.\r\nThese will enable the culturist to select whatever best suits his taste;\r\nadapted to quince or pear stocks; for the table or kitchen; for summer,\r\nfall, or winter use, and for home or the market.\r\n\r\nBELLE LUCRATIVE.--_Fondante d' Automne, Seigneur d' Esperin._ Tree of\r\nmoderate growth, but a great bearer. A fine variety, on quince or pear,\r\nbetter perhaps on the pear stock. Season, last of September.\r\n\r\nBEURRE EASTER with fifteen synonyms that few would ever read. Best on\r\nquince. Requires a warm soil and considerable care in ripening, when it\r\nproves one of the best. Its season--from January to May--makes it very\r\ndesirable. Large, yellowish-green, with russet spots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bartlett.]\r\n\r\nBARTLETT.--_William's, William's Bon Chretien, Poire Guilliaume_. Tree,\r\na vigorous grower, and a regular, early, good bearer, of long, handsome,\r\nperfectly-formed fruit; on the quince or pear stock. Time, August and\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Beurre Diel.]\r\n\r\nBEURRE DIEL.--_Diel_, _Diel's Butterbirne_, _Dorothee Royale_, _Grosse\r\nDorothee_, _Beurre Royale_, _Des Trois Tours_, _De Melon_, _Melon de\r\nKops_, _Beurre Magnifique_, _Beurre Incomparable_. Grows well on quince\r\nor pear, but perhaps does best on quince. Large, beautiful, luscious\r\nfruit. Season, October to last of November.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White Doyenne.]\r\n\r\nWHITE DOYENNE.--_Virgalieu._ Tree vigorous and hardy on pear or quince.\r\nEverywhere esteemed as one of the very best. Needs care in supplying\r\nproper manure and clay on light soils, to prevent the fruit from\r\ncracking. September to November. If we could have but one we should\r\nchoose this.\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA.--_Columbian Virgalieu._ Native of New York, bearing\r\nabundantly, a uniformly smooth, fair, large fruit. Color, fine golden\r\nyellow, dotted with gray. Season, December and January.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flemish Beauty.]\r\n\r\nFLEMISH BEAUTY.--_Belle de Flanders, &c._ This is a large, beautiful,\r\nand delicious pear. One of the finest in its season, but does not last\r\nlong. Ripens last of September. Very fine on the quince, and is\r\nexcellent on the rich prairie-lands of the West. Deserves increased\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nBEURRE D'AREMBERG.--_Duc d'Aremberg, and eight other synonyms._ Tree\r\nvery hardy, does well on the pear stock, and bears early, annually, and\r\nabundantly. A very fine foreign variety. The fruit hangs on the tree\r\nwell, and may be ripened at will from December to February, by placing\r\nin a warm room, when you would ripen them.\r\n\r\nBUFFUM.--A native of Rhode Island, and very successful wherever grown. A\r\ngreat bearer of handsome fruit, though not of the best quality. It is,\r\nhowever, an excellent orchard pear. Fruit, medium size, ripening in\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nLOUISE BONNE OF JERSEY.--_William the Fourth_, and three other useless\r\nforeign synonyms. Not surpassed, on the quince. Tree very vigorous,\r\nproducing a great abundance of large fruit. Season, October.\r\n\r\nMADELEINE.--_Magdalen_, _Citron des Carmes_. This bears an abundance of\r\nsmall but delicious fruit. Is valuable also on account of its\r\nseason--the last half of July. Good on pear or quince. Must be checked\r\nin its growth, on very rich land, or it will be subject to the frozen\r\nsap-blight.\r\n\r\nONONDAGA.--American origin. Equally good on pear or quince. Large,\r\nhardy, and very productive tree. The fruit is very large, fine golden\r\nyellow when ripe. Excellent for market. Season, October and November.\r\n\r\nPOUND PEAR.--_Winter Belle_, and twelve other synonyms, which are\r\nunimportant. This is the great winter-pear for cooking. The tree is a\r\nvery vigorous grower and great bearer. A very profitable orchard\r\nvariety. December to March.\r\n\r\nPRINCE'S ST. GERMAIN.--_New St. Germain_, _Brown's St. Germain_. Hardy\r\nand productive. Good keeper, ripening as easily and as well as an apple.\r\nDecember to March.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Seckel.]\r\n\r\nSECKEL.--There are a number of synonyms, but it is always known by this\r\nname. Tree is small, but a good and regular bearer of small excellent\r\nfruit. Time in warm climates, September and October.\r\n\r\nSTEVEN'S GENESEE.--_Stephen's Genesee_, _Guernsey_. Desirable for all\r\norchards and gardens, on quince or pear. Fine grower and very\r\nproductive. Fruit large and excellent. Elliott says \"even the wind-falls\r\nare very fine.\"\r\n\r\nVICAR OF WAKEFIELD.--Eight synonyms, but it will hardly be mistaken by\r\nnursery-men. Does well on quince. It is thrifty and very productive of\r\nfruit of second quality. Yet it is generally profitable. November to\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nWINTER NELLIS.--Its six foreign synonyms are of no consequence. This is\r\nthe best of all winter-pears, grown on quince or pear. Exceedingly well\r\nadapted to the rich western prairies. An early and great bearer.\r\nNovember to January 15.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gray Doyenne.]\r\n\r\nGRAY DOYENNE.--A superior October pear. Tree hardy and productive on\r\nboth pear or quince. Partakes much of the excellence of the White\r\nDoyenne.\r\n\r\nFrom these you can select five or six just adapted to your wishes. The\r\ndiversity of views, of the merits of different varieties of pears,\r\narises mainly from the influence of location, soil, and culture. The\r\nestablished known varieties, may be grown in great perfection anywhere,\r\nwith suitable care. At the West they _must be root-pruned_ and\r\n_headed-in_ until they are ten years old, after which they will be hardy\r\nand productive. If allowed to grow as fast as they will incline to, on\r\nalluvial soils, when they are exposed to severe winters, they will\r\ndisappoint growers. With care they will be sure and profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEPPERS.\r\n\r\nThe red peppers, cultivated in this country, are used for pickling, for\r\npepper-sauce, as a condiment for food, and as a domestic medicine.\r\n\r\n_Varieties_--are named principally from their shape. The _large\r\nsquash-pepper_ is best for green pickles, on account of its size and\r\ntenderness. The _Cayenne_, a small, long variety, much resembling the\r\noriginal from which it is named, is very pungent, used mostly for\r\npepper-sauce. Grind, not very fine, any of the varieties, and they are\r\nuseful on any food of a cold nature and not easily digestible. They are\r\nall good for medicinal purposes. The capsicum needs a dry, warm soil,\r\nwith exposure to the sun. Plants should stand two feet apart each way;\r\nas they are slow growers, they should be started in an early hotbed.\r\nMany will ripen during summer, and may be gathered. In the fall, when\r\nfrost comes, the vines will be covered with blossoms and with peppers of\r\nall sizes. Fall-grown green ones, strung on a thread, and hung in a\r\nwarm, dry room, will ripen finely. They are very hardy, and may be\r\ntransplanted without injury. Hen-manure is best for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEPPERGRASS.\r\n\r\nThis is a variety of cress, of quick growth, used as lettuce. On a rich,\r\nfinely-pulverized soil, sow the seeds in drills, fifteen inches apart,\r\nand cover very lightly. Sow thick and water in dry weather. For use, cut\r\nthe tops while they are very tender. A second crop will grow, but\r\ninferior to the first. The water-cress, growing spontaneously by rills\r\nand springs, is a kind of wild peppergrass, and is by some persons more\r\nesteemed than the garden variety. We prefer early lettuce to cresses or\r\npeppergrass, and see no reason for their cultivation, but their rapid\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLOWING.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most important matters in soil-culture. When, how,\r\nand how much, shall we plow? are the three questions involving the\r\nwhole. When should plowing be done? As it respects wet or dry, plow\r\nsandy or gravelly land whenever you are ready. It will neither be hard\r\nwhen dry, nor injured by being plowed when very wet. Good loams may be\r\nplowed at all times except when excessively wet. Clays can only be\r\nworked profitably when neither excessively wet or dry. Plowing land in a\r\nwarm rain is almost equal to a coat of manure. Plowing in a light snow\r\nin the spring will injure it the whole season. We have noticed a marked\r\ndifference in corn growing but a rod apart, on land where snow was\r\nplowed in, and the other plowed two or three days later, after the snow\r\nwas gone; this difference was noticeable in the rows throughout the\r\nentire field. Spring or fall plowing is a question that has been much\r\ndiscussed. Sod-land is better plowed in the fall. The action of winter\r\nrains and frosts on the turf is beneficial. The same is true of land\r\ntrenched deep, where much of the hard, poor subsoil is brought to the\r\nsurface: it is benefited by winter exposure. Other cultivated fields are\r\ninjured by fall-plowing, unless it be very early. All stubble-land is\r\nmuch benefited by being plowed as soon as the grain is taken off. The\r\nweeds and stubble, plowed under, will be decomposed by the warm weather\r\nand rains, and benefit the soil almost as much as an ordinary coat of\r\nmanure. Plowed late, such action does not take place, and the surface is\r\ninjured by winter-exposure: hence, do all the _early_ fall-plowing\r\npossible, but plow nothing _late_ in the fall but sod-land.\r\n\r\nHow shall we plow? All land should be subsoiled, except that having a\r\nlight, porous subsoil; one deep plowing on such land is sufficient.\r\nSubsoiling is done by using two teams at once--one with a common plow,\r\nrunning deep, and the other with a subsoil-plow with no mould-board, and\r\nwhich will, consequently, stir and disintegrate the earth to the depth\r\nat which it runs, without throwing it to the surface. The next\r\nsurface-furrow will cover up this loosened subsoil. In this way, land\r\nmay be plowed eighteen inches deep, to the great benefit of any crop\r\ngrown on it. If the surface be well manured, this method of plowing will\r\nplace the manure between the first furrow and the subsoil, and increase\r\nits value. Such plowing is very valuable on land for young fruit-trees.\r\nThere is another method, which we denominate double-plowing, which is\r\nmore beneficial than ordinary subsoiling: it is performed by two common\r\nplows, one following in the furrow of the other; the first furrow need\r\nnot be very deep--let the furrow in the bottom of the first be as deep\r\nas possible, and thrown out upon the surface; the next furrow will throw\r\nthe surface and manure into the bottom of the deep furrow; the next\r\nfurrow will cover this surface-soil and manure very deep, and, as manure\r\nalways works up, it will impregnate the whole. This, for\r\ngarden-vegetables, berries, nurseries, or young orchards, is the best\r\nform of plowing that we have ever tried. It may be done with one team,\r\nby simply changing the gauge of the clevis every time round, gauging it\r\nlight for the first furrow, and deep for the second. We once prepared a\r\nplat in this way with one team, on which cabbages made a remarkable\r\ngrowth, even in a dry season. Still a farther improvement would be a\r\nlight coat of fine manure on the surface. All furrows, in every\r\ndescription of plowing, should be near enough together to move the\r\nwhole, leaving no hard places between them. The usual \"cut and cover\"\r\nsystem, to get over a large area in a day, is miserable economy. The\r\nmore evenly and flatly land can be turned over in plowing, the better it\r\nwill be; it retards the growth of weeds, and secures a better action\r\nupon substances plowed under. An exception to deep plowing is in\r\nbreaking up the original prairies of the West: they have to be broken\r\nwith plows kept sharp as a knife, and not more than two inches deep. The\r\ngrass then dies and the sod rots. But plowed deep, the grass comes up\r\nthrough the turf, and will prove troublesome for two or three years. It\r\nmust also be broken at a certain season of the year, to insure success.\r\nIt may be profitably done for two months after the grass gets a good\r\nstart in the spring.\r\n\r\n_How much_ is it best to plow land? Once double-plowed, or thoroughly\r\nsubsoiled, and well turned over, is better than more. Land once plowed\r\nso as to disintegrate the whole to the depth of the furrow, will produce\r\nmore, and require less care, than the same would do if cross-plowed once\r\nor twice. Excessive plowing is a positive injury. All land should be\r\nbroken up once in three or four years, and not kept longer than that\r\nunder the plow at one time. Some farmers keep land perpetually in grass,\r\nrefusing to have a plow touch it on any condition. They see wrong\r\ntillage produce barrenness. But by this practice they are great losers;\r\nthey never get over one half the hay or pasturage that could be obtained\r\nby frequent tillage and manuring, and a rotation of crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUM.\r\n\r\nThis is one of our best fruits, but suffers more from enemies than any\r\nother.\r\n\r\n_Propagation_ is by seeds or layers, budding or grafting. Seeds from\r\ntrees not exposed to mixture with other varieties in the blossom, will\r\nproduce the same; hence, this is the best method of propagating a given\r\nvariety, standing alone. But, for most situations, budding is preferable\r\nto any other method. This should be performed earlier than on the peach.\r\nThe plum matures earlier, and hence should be budded about the last of\r\nJuly, or first of August. Bud on the north side of the tree to avoid\r\nthe hot sun; and tie more tightly than in budding other trees. Bud\r\nplum-trees the second year from the seed. Grafting should be resorted to\r\nonly when buds have failed, and there is a prospect that the trees will\r\nbe too large for budding another season. The common wild plums make good\r\nstocks, if grafted at the ground. Thoroughly mulch all newly-grafted\r\nplum-trees. Root-grafting will succeed, but should never be practised.\r\nIn all grafting of plums, put the graft in at the surface of the ground,\r\nand cover with sawdust or mould, leaving but one bud on the graft\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\n_Soil._--All soils are good for the plum, provided they be thoroughly\r\ndrained, and properly fertilized.\r\n\r\nHard soils are recommended as being almost proof against the curculio.\r\nThat a soil affording a rather hard, smooth surface, will afford less\r\nburrows for curculio, and consequently lessen their ravages, is no doubt\r\ntrue. But it is not a perfect remedy, and, on other accounts, such a\r\nsoil is no better. A good firm loam is best. Plums will do well also on\r\nlight land, but are more exposed to injury from the curculio.\r\n\r\n_Transplanting._--The plum being perfectly hardy, we recommend\r\ntransplanting in autumn. Shorten in the top, cut off considerable of the\r\ntap-root, and the ends of the long roots, transplant well, and mulch so\r\nthoroughly as to prevent too strong action of the frost on the roots,\r\nand they will start early and do well. Twelve feet apart for small\r\nvarieties, and twenty feet for larger growers, are the distances usually\r\nrecommended. We think a rod apart each way will do well for all\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n_Pruning._--Once started in a regular growth, in such a shape as you\r\ndesire, no further pruning will be necessary but occasionally\r\nheading-in a too luxuriant shoot, and removing diseased and cross limbs.\r\nOn rich Western lands, and in warm Southern climes, young plum-trees\r\nmust be root-pruned and headed-in, or they will be unfruitful and\r\nunhealthy. Root-pruning should be done in August, in the following\r\nmanner. In case of a tree ten feet high, take a sharp spade, and in a\r\ncircle around the tree, two feet from the trunk (making the circle four\r\nfeet in diameter), cut off all the roots within reach. In smaller trees,\r\nmake the circle smaller, and in larger ones, larger. At the same time,\r\nshorten in the current year's growth, by cutting off one half the length\r\nof all the principal shoots; this will give vigor, symmetry, and\r\nfruitfulness, and prove a valuable preventive of disease. Plum-trees\r\nshould always have good, clean cultivation.\r\n\r\n_Manures_ from the stable and slaughter-house, with wood-ashes, lime,\r\nand plenty of salt, are the best for the plum. The following analysis,\r\nby Richardson, of the fruit of the plum, will aid the culturist in his\r\nselection of manures:--\r\n\r\n  Potash            59.21\r\n  Soda                .54\r\n  Lime              10.04\r\n  Magnesia           5.46\r\n  Sulphuric acid     3.83\r\n  Silicic acid       2.36\r\n  Phosphoric acid   12.26\r\n  Phosphate of iron  6.04\r\n\r\nHence, as wood-ashes contains much potash, and as this is the largest\r\ningredient in the plum, it must be the best application to the soil for\r\nthis fruit. Bones, dissolved in sulphuric acid, would also be very\r\nvaluable. Bones, bonedust, salt, wood-ashes, and barnyard manure, with a\r\nlittle lime, will be all that will be necessary.\r\n\r\n_Diseases._--In most northern latitudes, the black wart, or knot, is\r\nfatal to many plum-trees. It is less prevalent at the South: its origin\r\nis not known. Many theories respecting it are put forth by different\r\ncultivators; they are unsatisfactory, and their enumeration here would\r\nbe useless. It may be either the result of general ill health in the\r\ntree, from budding on suckers and unhealthy stocks, and a want of proper\r\nelements in the soil, or of improper circulation of sap, caused by the\r\nroots absorbing more than the leaves can digest. In the latter case,\r\nroot-pruning and heading-in would be an effectual preventive. In the\r\nformer, supply suitable manures, and give good cultivation. In every\r\ncase, remove at once all affected parts, and wash the wounds and whole\r\ntree, and drench the soil under it, with copperas-water--one ounce of\r\ncopperas to two gallons of water. This is stated to be a complete\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\n_Defoliation_ of seedlings and bearing trees often occurs in July and\r\nAugust. Land well supplied with the manures recommended, especially\r\nwood-ashes, salt, and the copperas-water, has not been known to produce\r\ntrees that drop their leaves.\r\n\r\n_Decay of the Fruit_ is another serious evil. Professor Kirtland and\r\nothers suppose it to be a species of fungus. Poverty of soil, and wet\r\nweather, may be the cause. If the season be unusually wet, thin the\r\nfruit, so that no two plums shall touch each other. Keep the soil\r\nproperly manured, and spread charcoal or straw under the tree, and you\r\nwill generally be able to preserve your fruit.\r\n\r\n_The Curculio_ is the great enemy of the plum, and frequently of all\r\nsmooth-skinned fruits, as the grape, nectarine, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (1) Curculio, in the beetle-form, life-size. (2) Its\r\nassumed form when disturbed or shaken from the tree. (3) Larva, or worm,\r\nas found in the fallen fruit. (4) Pupa, or chrysalis state, in which it\r\nlives in the ground.]\r\n\r\nMany remedies are proposed: making pavements, or keeping the ground hard\r\nand smooth, under the trees; pasturing swine and keeping fowls in the\r\nplum-orchard; syringing the whole tops of the trees four or five times\r\nwith lime and salt water, or lime and sulphur-water--the proportions are\r\nnot material, provided it be not excessively strong. It is recommended\r\nto apply with a garden-syringe. But, as few cultivators will have that\r\ninstrument, they may sprinkle the mixture on the trees in any way most\r\nconvenient. Salt, worked into the soil under plum-trees, is said to\r\ndestroy this insect in its pupa state. At any rate, the salt is a good\r\nmanure for the plum-tree. We know a remedy for the ravages of the\r\ncurculio, unfailing in all seasons and localities--that is, to kill\r\nthem: spread a cloth under the tree, and with a mallet having a head,\r\ncovered with India-rubber or cloth that it may not injure the bark,\r\nstrike the body and large limbs sudden blows, which will so jar them as\r\nto cause the insects to fall upon the cloth, and you can then burn them.\r\nDo this five or six times in the season, commencing when the fruit\r\nbegins to set, and continuing till it becomes nearly full-grown. This is\r\nbest done in the cool of the morning, while the insects are still; their\r\nhabits of fear and quiet, when there is a noise about, are greatly in\r\nfavor of their destruction by this method. This is somewhat laborious,\r\nbut is a sure remedy, and will pay well in all plum-orchards, large or\r\nsmall. After two or three years of this treatment, there will be few or\r\nnone of those insects left.\r\n\r\n_Uses_ of the plum are various. The fine varieties, well ripened, are a\r\ngood dessert-fruit; for sweetmeats and tarts they are much esteemed;\r\nthey are one of the better and more wholesome dried fruits. The foreign\r\nones are called prunes, and are an article of commerce. With a little\r\ncare, we can raise much better prunes than the imported. Like all\r\nfruits, they are better for quick drying by artificial heat. The French\r\nprunes, the process of drying which is minutely described by Downing in\r\nhis fruit-book, are no better than our best varieties, quickly dried by\r\nartificial heat in a dry house, or moderately-heated oven. All dried\r\nfruit is much better for having become perfectly ripe before picking. It\r\nis a great mistake to suppose unripe fruit will be good dried.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lawrence's Favorite.]\r\n\r\n_Varieties_ are numerous, and many of them ought to be forgotten, as is\r\nthe case with all other fruits. We give a small list, containing all the\r\ngood qualities of the whole:--\r\n\r\n_Bleecker's Gage._--A hardy tree and sure bearer. Time, August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Imperial Gage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Egg.]\r\n\r\n_Imperial Gage._--This is an American variety. It is of a lightish-green\r\ncolor, and excellent flavor. Season, July at the South, and September at\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\n_Egg._--The above cut represents one of the egg-plums, of excellent\r\nquality in all respects. There are many of this name.\r\n\r\n_Lawrence's Favorite._--This is a fine plum, of the gage family. It was\r\nraised from the seed of the green gage; its qualities are seldom\r\nsurpassed.\r\n\r\n_Washington._--This is a very good plum for high latitudes. At the South\r\nit is too dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Green Gage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jefferson.]\r\n\r\n_Green Gage._--With fifteen synonyms. Excellent.\r\n\r\n_Jefferson._--One of the very best. Time, last of August.\r\n\r\n_Denniston's Purple, or Red._--Vigorous grower and very productive.\r\nTime, August 20.\r\n\r\n_Madison._--A hardy, productive, and excellent October plum.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing varieties, with the little black damson-plum, so hardy and\r\nproductive, and so much esteemed for preserving, will answer all needful\r\npurposes. You will find long lists in the fruit-books. Some of them are\r\nthe above varieties, under different names. Procure four or five of the\r\nbest you can find in your vicinity, and cultivate them, and you will\r\nneed no others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Washington.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOMEGRANATE.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most delicious and beautiful of all the\r\ndessert-fruits. Native in China, and much cultivated in Southern Europe.\r\nIt will do quite well as far north as the Ohio river. Trained as an\r\nespalier, with protection of straw or mats, it will do tolerably well\r\nthroughout the Middle states. The fruit is about as large as an ordinary\r\napple, and has a tough, orange-colored skin, with a beautiful red cheek.\r\nThe tree is of low growth. Blossoms are highly ornamental, as is also\r\nthe fruit, during all the season. It is cultivated as the orange.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties: the _sweet-fruited_, the _sub-acid_, and\r\nthe _wild_ or _acid-fruited_. The first is the best, and the second the\r\none most cultivated in this country; the latter yields a very pleasant\r\nacid, making an excellent sirup. Pomegranates should be extensively\r\ncultivated at the South, and form an important article of commerce for\r\nNorthern cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO.\r\n\r\nThis is far the most valuable of all esculent roots; supposed to be a\r\nnative of South America. It is called the Irish potato, because it was\r\ngrown extensively first in Ireland. It was first planted on the estate\r\nof Sir Walter Raleigh in 1602. It was introduced into England in 1694.\r\nIt has been represented as having been introduced into England from\r\nVirginia as early as 1586, but attracted no attention, and for two\r\ncenturies formed no considerable part of British agriculture. It has\r\nbecome naturalized in all temperate regions, and in many locations in\r\nhigh latitudes. In tropical climates, it flourishes on the mountains, at\r\nan elevation sufficient to secure a cool atmosphere. Cool moist regions,\r\nas Ireland and the northern parts of the United States, are most\r\nfavorable for potatoes. In warm climates the potato grows less\r\nluxuriantly, yields much less, and is liable to be ruined by a second\r\ngrowth. In the latitude of southern Ohio, a severe drought, while the\r\ntubers are small, followed by considerable rain, causes the young\r\npotatoes to sprout, and send up fresh shoots, and often make a very\r\nluxuriant growth of tops, to the complete ruin of the tubers. This is\r\ncalled second growth. In cooler climates this second growth simply makes\r\nprongs on the tubers, thus injuring the appearance and quality, but\r\nincreasing the crop. The only preventive is watering regularly in a dry\r\ntime. This can be done advantageously in a garden, and on a small scale.\r\nIn field culture, when second growth occurs, dig your potatoes at once,\r\nif they are large enough to be of much use. If not they will all be\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n_Propagation_ is by annually planting the tubers. No mixture of sorts\r\never takes place from planting different varieties together. This can\r\nonly be done in the blossoms, and will consequently appear in young\r\nseedlings. To raise good potatoes, always plant ripe seed, and the\r\nlargest and best, and leave them whole. Selecting small potatoes for\r\nseed, and cutting them up, and planting mere eyes and pearings as some\r\ndo, has done much to injure the health, quality, and quantity of yield\r\nof the potato. Selecting the poorest for seed, will run out anything we\r\ngrow in the soil. _New varieties_ have been multiplying within the past\r\nfew years from seed. Some gentlemen are raising varieties by thousands.\r\nNot more than one out of a thousand prove truly valuable. The quality of\r\na new variety can not be established earlier than the fifth year. Many\r\nthat promised well at first proved worthless.\r\n\r\nTo raise from seed, gather the balls after they have matured, hang them\r\nin a dry place till they become quite soft, when separate the seeds and\r\ndry them as others, and plant as early as the temperature of the soil\r\nfavors vegetation. Chance varieties from seed of balls left to decay in\r\nthe fall, as tomatoes, are recorded. Probably our present best varieties\r\nhad such an origin. Raising new varieties requires much care and\r\npatience. Keep each one separate, plant only the best, and then you\r\nmust wait four or five years to determine whether, out of a thousand,\r\nyou have one good variety.\r\n\r\n_Varieties._--These are numerous. Those best adapted to one locality,\r\nare often inferior in another. That excellent potato, the Carter, so\r\nfirm in New England and western New York, is ill-shapen and inferior in\r\nmany localities in Illinois. The Neshannock or common Mercer produces a\r\nlarger yield in Illinois than in the Eastern states, but of a slightly\r\ninferior quality. Most seeds do better transported from a colder to a\r\nwarmer climate, but with the potato the reverse is true. The best\r\npotatoes of Ireland are usually inferior in the warmer latitudes of this\r\ncountry. In ordering potatoes for seed it is better to describe the\r\nquality than to order by the name. We omit any list, of even the best\r\nvarieties. They are known by different names, and are not equally good\r\nin all localities. And all varieties are scattered over the whole\r\ncountry, very soon, by dealers, and through the agency of agricultural\r\nsocieties and periodicals. Different varieties should be kept separate,\r\nas they look better for market, and no two will cook in precisely the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n_Plant the large potatoes and plant them whole._ From a small eye or a\r\nsmall potato to the largest they will vegetate equally well. And in a\r\nwet, cool season, the small seed will produce nearly as good a crop as\r\nthe large. But the large seed matures earlier, and in a dry season\r\nproduces a much larger crop. The moisture in a large potato decaying in\r\nthe hill, is of great use to the growing plants, in a dry season. It is\r\nalso generally conceded that potatoes growing from cut seed are more\r\nliable to be affected by the rot.\r\n\r\n_Quantity of seed per acre._--The practices of farmers vary from five\r\nto twenty bushels. It takes a less number of bushels per acre when the\r\nseed is cut. The quantity is also affected by the size of the seed, the\r\nlarger the potatoes the more will it take to seed an acre.\r\n\r\nPlentiful, but not excessive, seeding is best. It is a universal fact\r\nthat you can never get something for nothing. Hence light seeding will\r\nbring a light yield. We think it best to put one good-sized potato in a\r\nplace and make the rows three feet apart each way. We think they yield\r\nbetter than at any other distances or in any other way. We have often\r\ntried drills, and found them more trouble, with no greater yield. The\r\nsoil should be disintegrated to the depth of sixteen inches and the\r\npotatoes planted four inches deep, and cultivated with subsoil plow, and\r\nother suitable tools, in a manner to leave the surface nearly flat.\r\nHilling up potatoes never does any good. We advise always to harrow the\r\ncrop, as soon as they begin to appear through the soil.\r\n\r\n_Soil._--Any good rich garden soil is good for this crop, provided it be\r\nwell drained. Potatoes like moisture, but are ruined by having water\r\nstand in the soil. New land and newly broken-up old pastures are best.\r\n\r\n_Manures._--All the usual fertilizers are good for potatoes, but\r\nespecially ashes and plaster. The application above all others, for\r\npotatoes, is potash. Dissolve it in water, making it quite weak, and\r\nsaturate your other manures with it, and the effect will always be\r\nmarked. The tops contain a great deal of potash, and should always be\r\nplowed in and decay in the soil where they grow, otherwise they will\r\nrapidly exhaust the land. It is supposed that nothing will do more to\r\nrestore the former vigor and health of the potato than a liberal\r\napplication of potash in the soil in which they grow. The crop will be\r\nmuch increased in a dry season by manuring in the hill, dropping the\r\npotato first and putting the manure on the top of it.\r\n\r\n_Gathering and Preserving._--The usual hand-digging with hoe or\r\npotato-fork are well known, and do well when the crop is not large. But\r\nfor those who grow potatoes for market, it is better to employ the plow\r\nin digging. Modern inventions for this purpose can everywhere be found\r\nin the agricultural warehouses. Potatoes are well preserved in a good\r\ncool cellar, in boxes or barrels; and are better for being covered with\r\nmoist sand. The usual method of burying them outdoor is effectual and\r\nsafe, if they be covered beyond the reach of frost, and have a small\r\nairhole at the apex, filled with straw.\r\n\r\n_The Potato Disease._--This is altogether atmospherical. A new piece of\r\nland was cleared for potatoes. In the middle was a close muck, on a\r\ncoarse, gravelly subsoil. In the lowest place a ditch was dug, to carry\r\noff the superabundance of water; from that ditch the coarse gravel was\r\nthrown out on one side, and suffered to remain at considerable depth.\r\nOnly two or three rods distant, on one side the plat extended over a\r\nknoll of loose sand. Potatoes were planted, from the same seed, at the\r\nsame time, and in the same manner, on these three kinds of land, side by\r\nside. They were all tended alike, needing little hoeing or care, the\r\nland being new. The rot prevailed badly that season. On digging the\r\npotatoes, it was found that in the coarse gravel, where the air could\r\ncirculate almost as freely as in a pile of stove-wood, all the potatoes\r\nwere rotten: on the muck, which was unlike a peat-bog, very fine and\r\ntight, almost impervious to the atmosphere, they were nearly all sound;\r\non the sand, which was quite open, but tighter than the gravel, part\r\nwere decayed and the rest sound. Their condition was graduated entirely\r\nby the condition of the soil. It is an apparent objection to this\r\ntheory, that when the rot prevails, the best potatoes are raised on\r\nlight, sandy soils. It is said that they are open to the action of air.\r\nTo this it is replied, that whether they rot or not, in sandy soils,\r\ndepends on the kind of sand. On some sand they rot very badly, on others\r\nhardly at all. Sandy soils differ very materially: some are almost pure\r\nsilex; while others are filled with a fine dust, and, although\r\napparently loose, are much more nearly impervious to the air than\r\nheavier soils; on the former, nearly all will decay, and on the latter,\r\nmost will be preserved.\r\n\r\nLook at the immense potato crops near Rochester, N. Y., on sandy land.\r\nWe have personally examined it, and find it to be filled with dust, that\r\nexcludes the air, and saves the potato from rot. Why, then, is a heavy\r\nclay useless for potatoes? Is not clay a very tight soil? Unbroken it\r\nis; but, when plowed, it is always left in larger particles than other\r\nland--it is but seldom pulverized. The spaces between the particles are\r\nall open to the free action of the air; hence, instead of being close,\r\nit is one of the most open of all our soils. This confirms the theory.\r\n\r\nThe influence of manuring land is still another confirmation. We are\r\ndirected not to manure our land for potatoes when the disease prevails.\r\nIt is said we can raise no sound potatoes on rich land when the rot is\r\nabroad. This is an error. The richness of the soil does not promote the\r\ndisease; but if any kind of manure be applied that, from its bulk and\r\ncoarseness, keeps the soil open to the air, the potatoes will rot. But\r\nfertilize to the highest extent, in any way that does not make the soil\r\ntoo open, and let in the air, and the crop will be greatly increased\r\nwith perfect safety. Thus, this theory, like every truth, perfectly fits\r\nin all its bearings.\r\n\r\nThere is, then, no perfect remedy for the disease but in the power of\r\nHim who can purify the atmosphere. Numerous remedies and preventives\r\nhave been recommended, by those who suppose they have tried them with\r\nsuccess. But in other localities and soils, all their remedies have\r\nfailed, as will all others that will yet be discovered. A careful\r\nexamination of the texture of the soils, upon the principles here\r\nindicated, and a repetition of their experiments, will show the\r\ndiscoverers that their success depended upon their soils, while others\r\nfailed in using the same remedies on other soils. The practical uses of\r\nthis theory are obvious. When the disease is abroad, we should select\r\nsoil that excludes, as much as possible, the atmosphere, and plant\r\n_deep_; on all land not liable to have water stand on the subsoil. Do\r\nnot be deceived into the belief that all sandy land will bear good\r\npotatoes, in the seasons when the disease prevails. The worst rot we\r\never had was in 1855, on very sandy land. This year (1857) we have\r\nwitnessed the worst rot in open sand and gravel. Add to this, great care\r\nin preserving the health of the tubers. Plant very early, only whole\r\npotatoes, and of mature growth, thoroughly ripe; apply a little salt and\r\nlime, plaster rather plentifully, and potash, or plenty of\r\nwood-ashes--and you will succeed in the worst of seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVING FRUITS, &c.\r\n\r\nThe essentials in preserving fruits, berries, and vegetables, during the\r\nwhole year, are, a total exclusion from atmospheric action, and, in some\r\nvegetables, a strong action of heat. We have a variety of patent cans,\r\nand several processes are recommended. The patent cans serve a good\r\npurpose, but, for general use, are inferior to those ordinarily made by\r\nthe tinman. The patent articles are only good for one year, and are used\r\nwith greater difficulty by the unskilful. The ordinary tin cans, made in\r\nthe form of a cylinder, with an orifice in the top large enough to admit\r\nwhatever you would preserve, will last ten years, with careful usage,\r\nand they are so simple that no mistakes need be made. It is usually\r\nrecommended to solder on the cover, which is simply a square piece of\r\ntin large enough to cover the orifice. Soldering may be best for those\r\ncans that are to be transported a long distance, but it is troublesome,\r\nand is entirely unnecessary for domestic use. A little sealing-wax,\r\nwhich any apothecary can make at a cheap rate, laid on the top of the\r\ncan when hot, will melt, and the cover placed upon it will adhere and\r\ncause it to be air-tight. All articles that do not part with their aroma\r\nby being cooked, may be perfectly preserved in such cans, by putting\r\nthem in when boiling, seasoned to your taste, and putting on the covers\r\nat once. The cans should be full, and set in a cool place, and the\r\narticles will remain in a perfect state for a year. The finest articles\r\nof fruit, as peaches and strawberries, may be preserved so as to retain\r\nall their peculiar aroma, by putting them into such cans, filled with a\r\nsirup of pure sugar, and placing the cans so filled in a kettle of\r\nwater, and raising it to a boiling heat, and then putting on the cover\r\nas above; the heat expels the air, and the cover and wax keep it out.\r\nStone jugs are used for the same purposes, but are not sufficiently\r\ntight to keep out the air, unless well painted after having become cold.\r\nWide-mouthed glass bottles are excellent. But, in using glass or stone\r\nware, the corks must be put in and tied at the commencement, leaving a\r\nsmall aperture for the escape of steam, and the process of raising the\r\nwater to a boiling heat must be gradual, requiring three or four hours,\r\nor the bottles will be broken by sudden expansion. Make the corks\r\nair-tight by covering with sealing-wax on taking from the boiling water.\r\nSome vegetables, as peas, beans, cauliflowers, &c., need considerable\r\nboiling, in order to perfect preservation. Tin cans may stand in the\r\nwater and boil an hour or two, if you choose, and then be sealed. The\r\nbottles should be corked tight, have the cork tied in, and then be\r\nimmersed and boil for an hour: take them out, and dip the cork and mouth\r\nof the bottles in sealing-wax, and all will be safe.\r\n\r\nBy one of these processes, exclusion of the atmosphere and thorough\r\nboiling, we may preserve any fruit or vegetable, so as to have an\r\nabundance, nearly as good as the fresh in its season, the whole year,\r\nand that at a trifling expense. All fruits and vegetables may also be\r\npreserved by drying. By being properly dried, the original aroma can be\r\nmostly retained. The essentials in properly drying are artificial heat\r\nand free circulation of the air about the drying articles. Fruit dried\r\nin the sun is not nearly so fine as that dried by artificial heat. An\r\noven from which bread has just been taken is suitable for this purpose;\r\nbut a dry-house is better. A tight room, with a stove in the bottom, and\r\nthe fruit in shallow drawers, put in from the outside, serves a good\r\npurpose. Construct the room so as to give a draft, the heated air\r\npassing out at the top, and the process of drying will be greatly\r\nfacilitated, and the more rapid the process, without cooking the fruit,\r\nthe better will be its quality. This process is applicable to all kinds\r\nof vegetables. Roots, as beets, carrots, parsnips, or potatoes, should\r\nbe sliced before drying. The object in drying the latter articles would\r\nbe to afford the luxury of good vegetables for armies and ships' crews,\r\nin distant regions, and in climates where they are not grown. Milk can\r\nbe condensed and preserved for a long time, and, being greatly reduced\r\nin quantity, it is easily transported. It is not generally known in the\r\ncountry that Mr. Gail Borden, of New York, has invented a method of\r\ncondensing milk, fresh from the cow, so that it will perfectly retain\r\nall its excellences, including the cream, and by being sealed up in tin\r\ncans, as above, may be kept for many months. The milk and the process of\r\ncondensation have been scientifically examined by the New York Academy\r\nof Medicine, and pronounced perfect, and of great value to the world. We\r\nhave used the condensed milk, which was more than a month old; it had\r\nbeen kept in a tin can without sealing and without ice, but in a cool\r\nplace. It was sweet and good, differing in no respect from fresh milk\r\nfrom the cow, except that the heat employed in condensing it gave it the\r\ntaste of boiled milk. If kept in a warm place, and exposed to the\r\natmosphere, it may sour nearly as soon as other milk: but it may be\r\nsealed up and kept cool so as to be good for a long time. The\r\ncondensation is accomplished by simple evaporation of the watery part,\r\nin pans in vacuo. No substance whatever is put into the milk. Four\r\ngallons of fresh milk are condensed into one. When wanted for use, the\r\nquantity desired is put into twice the quantity of water, which makes\r\ngood cream for coffee; or one part to four of water makes good new milk;\r\nand one part to five or six makes a better milk than that usually sold\r\nin cities. Steamers now lay in a supply for a voyage to Liverpool and\r\nreturn, and on arrival in New York, the milk is as good as when taken on\r\nboard. The advantages will be numerous. Such milk will be among regular\r\nsupplies for armies and navies, and for all shipping to distant\r\ncountries. All cities and villages may have pure, cheap milk, as the\r\ncondensation will render transportation so cheap that milk can be sent\r\nfrom any part of the country where it is most plenty and cheapest. The\r\nprocess is patented, but will be granted to others at reasonable rates,\r\nby Borden & Co.; and eventually it will become general, when farmers can\r\ncondense and lay by, in the season when it is abundant, milk for use in\r\nthe winter, when cows are dry. This will make milk abundant at all\r\nseasons of the year, and plenty wherever we choose to carry it. It will\r\nalso save the lives of thousands of children, in cities, that are fed on\r\nunwholesome milk or poisonous mixtures. There is no temptation to\r\nadulterate such milk, for the process of condensation is cheaper than\r\nany mixture that could be passed.\r\n\r\nPreserving hams is effectually done by either of the following methods.\r\nAfter well curing and smoking, sew them up in a bag of cotton cloth,\r\nfitting closely, and dip them into a tub of lime-whitewash, nearly as\r\nthick as cream, and hang up in a cool room. This is a good method,\r\nthough they will sometimes mould. The other process, and the one we most\r\nrecommend, is to put well cured and smoked hams in a cask, or box, with\r\nvery fine charcoal; put in a layer of charcoal, and then one of hams;\r\ncover with another layer of coal and then of hams, and so on, until the\r\ncask is full, or all your hams are deposited. No mould will appear, and\r\nno insect will touch them. This method is perfect.\r\n\r\nAnother process, involving the same principles as the preceding, is to\r\nwrap the hams in muslin, and bury them in salt. The muslin keeps the\r\nsalt from striking in, and the salt prevents mould and insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUMPKIN.\r\n\r\nThere are some five or six varieties in cultivation. Loudon says six,\r\nand Russell's catalogue has five. The number is increasing, and names\r\nbecoming uncertain. Certain varieties are called pumpkins by some, and\r\nsquashes by others. The large yellow Connecticut, or Yankee pumpkin, is\r\nbest for all uses. The large cheese pumpkin is good at the South and\r\nWest. The mammoth that has weighed as high as two hundred and thirty\r\npounds, is a squash, more ornamental than useful. The seven years'\r\npumpkin is a great keeper. It has doubtless been kept through several\r\nyears without decay. Pumpkins will grow on any good rich soil, but best\r\non new land, and in a wet season. Do best alone, but will grow well\r\namong corn and better with potatoes. A good crop of pumpkins can seldom\r\nbe raised, two years in succession, on the same land. Care in saving\r\nseed is very important. The spot on the end that was originally covered\r\nby the blossom, varies much in dimensions, on pumpkins of the same size.\r\nSeeds from those having small blossom-marks, bear very few, and from\r\nthose having large ones, produce abundantly.\r\n\r\nThey are good fall and winter feed for most animals. They will cause\r\nhogs to grow rapidly, if boiled with roots, and mixed with a little\r\ngrain. Fed raw to milch cows and fattening cattle, they are valuable.\r\nLearn a horse to eat them raw, and if his work be not too hard, he will\r\nfatten on them. They may be preserved in a dry cellar, in a warm room as\r\nsweet potatoes, or in a mow of hay or straw, that will not freeze\r\nthrough. But for family use they are better stewed green, and dried.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\n\r\nThis fruit, with its uses, for drying, cooking, marmalades, flavors to\r\ntarts and pies made of other fruits, and for preserving as a sweetmeat,\r\nis well known and highly esteemed.\r\n\r\nThe quince is rather a shrub than a tree. It should be set ten feet\r\napart each way, in deep, rich soil. It needs little pruning, except\r\nremoving dead or cross branches, and cutting off and burning at once,\r\ntwigs affected with the insect-blight, as mentioned under pears. The\r\nsoil should be manured every year, by working-in a top-dressing of fine\r\nmanure, including a little salt.\r\n\r\n_Propagation_--is by seeds, buds, or cuttings. Budding does very well.\r\nSeedlings are not always true to the varieties. Cuttings, put out early\r\nand a little in the shade, nearly all take. This is the best and easiest\r\nmethod of propagation.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties; the _apple-shaped_, _pear-shaped_, and the\r\n_Portugal_, are the principal.\r\n\r\nThe apple-shaped, or orange quince (and perhaps the large-fruited may be\r\nthe same) is, on the whole, the best of all. Early, a great bearer, and\r\nexcellent for all uses. The pear-shaped is smaller, harder, and later.\r\nIt may be kept longer in a green state, and therefore be carried much\r\nfarther. The only reason for cultivating it would be its lateness and\r\nits keeping qualities. The Portugal quince is the finest fruit of all,\r\nbut is such a shy bearer as to be unprofitable. The _Rea quince_ is a\r\nseedling raised by Mr. Joseph Rea, of Greene county, New York, and is\r\npronounced by Downing \"an acquisition.\" The fruit is very handsome, and\r\none third larger than the common apple or orange quince. The tree is\r\nthrifty, hardy, and productive. It is a valuable modification of the\r\napple-shaped or orange quince, superior to the original. Such varieties\r\nmay be multiplied and improved, by new seedlings and high cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nRABBITS.\r\n\r\nTo prevent rabbits and mice from girdling fruit-trees in winter, is very\r\nimportant to fruit-growers. The meadow-mouse is very destructive to\r\nyoung trees, under cover of snow. Rabbits will girdle trees after the\r\ngreen foliage on which they delight to feed is gone. Take four quarts of\r\nfresh-slaked lime, the same quantity of fresh cows' dung, two quarts of\r\nsalt, and a handful of flour of sulphur; mix all together, with just\r\nenough water to bring it to the consistency of thick paint. At the\r\ncommencement of cold weather, paint the trunks of the trees two feet\r\nhigh with this mixture, and not a tree will suffer from rabbits or\r\nmice. Treading own the snow does good, but it is very troublesome, and\r\nnot a perfect remedy. Experience has never known the foregoing wash to\r\nfail.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADISH.\r\n\r\nThis is a well-known root, eaten only raw, and when young and tender. A\r\nrich sandy soil is best. Like most turnips, the roots are more tender\r\nand perfect when grown in rather cool weather; hence, those grown in\r\nearly spring are better than a summer growth. They do well in an early\r\nhotbed.\r\n\r\nThe _Scarlet_ and _White Turnip-rooted_ are fine for early use. They are\r\nalways small, but fair, and very early.\r\n\r\nThe _Scarlet Short-top_ comes next, and is a very fine variety. These\r\nmay be had through the whole season, by sowing at proper intervals;\r\nhence, others are unnecessary. Other good varieties are the _Summer_, or\r\n_Long White Naples_; _Long Salmon_, a large, gray radish, not generally\r\ndescribed in the books (a splendid variety in southern Ohio); and the\r\n_Black Spanish_ for fall and winter use. This grows large like a turnip,\r\nand is preserved in the same way. The best method of guarding against\r\nworms is to take equal quantities of fresh horse-manure and\r\nbuckwheat-bran, and mix and spade them into the bed. Active fermentation\r\nfollows, and toadstools will grow up within forty-eight hours, when you\r\nshould spade up the bed again and sow the seed; they will grow very\r\nquickly, be very tender, and entirely free from worms.\r\n\r\nRadish-seed is sown with slow-vegetating seeds, as carrots, beets,\r\nparsnips, &c. The radishes mark the rows, so that they may be cleared of\r\nweeds, and the ground stirred before the plants would otherwise be\r\ndiscernible, and also shade the germinating seeds and the young plants\r\nfrom destruction from a hot sun. The radishes may be pulled out when the\r\nmain crop needs the ground and sun. For this purpose the scarlet\r\nshort-top variety is used, because the long root loosens the soil in\r\npulling; and as the crown stands so much above the surface, they may be\r\ncrushed down with a small roller, and thus destroyed without the labor\r\nof pulling. Sowing radish-seed among root-crops, and cultivating early\r\nwith a root-cleaner, an acre of roots can be raised with about the same\r\nlabor as an acre of corn.\r\n\r\n\r\nRASPBERRY.\r\n\r\nThe common black raspberry we have noticed elsewhere as one of the most\r\nprofitable in cultivation. The other varieties, worthy of general\r\ncultivation, are the Franconia, the Fastollf, the red, and the white or\r\nyellow Antwerp. Any good garden-soil is suitable for raspberries. It\r\nshould be worked deep, and have decayed wood and leaves mixed with\r\nbarnyard manure and wood-ashes. In all but very cold latitudes,\r\nraspberries should be planted where they may be a little shaded. None of\r\nthe finer old varieties produce a good crop of fruit without\r\nwinter-protection. The canes may live without it, but will bear but\r\nlittle fruit. The best method of protection is to bend down the canes at\r\nthe beginning of winter, before the ground freezes, and cover them\r\nlightly, with the soil around them. They should first have some\r\nwell-rotted manure put around the canes. Stools should be four feet\r\napart, and have about five or six canes in a stool. Cut away the rest.\r\nThe best of all manures for raspberries is said to be spent tan-bark.\r\nPut it around in the fall to the depth of two inches; work it into the\r\nsoil in the spring, and put around fresh tan-bark, to the same depth.\r\n\r\nThe varieties for general cultivation are few. The common black is one\r\nof the best. The common wild American red, native in all the Middle and\r\nEastern states, is greatly improved by cultivation. As it is perfectly\r\nhardy, and a great and early bearer, it should have a place in every\r\ncollection. The Franconia is a fine fruit, and, among those generally\r\ncultivated, occupies the first place. The yellow Antwerp is\r\nfine-flavored and good-sized, but too soft for a general market-berry.\r\nThe same is true of the Fastollf. The red Antwerp is good, but quite\r\ninferior to the new red Antwerp, or Hudson River Antwerp. The Ohio\r\nEvergreen is a new variety, hardy, prolific, and a long bearer, fine\r\nfruit in considerable quantities having been picked on the 1st of\r\nNovember. On this account, it should be in every garden. There are two\r\nkinds of red raspberries brought to notice by Mr. Lewis P. Allen, of\r\nBlack Rock, N. Y., that deserve extensive cultivation, if they warrant\r\nhis recommendation. Mr. Allen says he has cultivated them for a number\r\nof years, and, with no winter protection, they have borne a large crop\r\nof excellent fruit every year, pronounced by dealers in Buffalo market\r\nsuperior to any other variety. Should these varieties prove equally good\r\nelsewhere, they deserve a place in every garden in the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHUBARB.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties of rhubarb now in cultivation.\r\n\r\n_The Victoria, Mammoth, and Scotch Hybrid_, all of which (if they be\r\nreally distinct) are fine and large, under proper culture. There is much\r\nof the old inferior kind, which generally affords only small short\r\nleaves, and which is of no value, compared with the large varieties. The\r\nmethod of growing is very simple, and yet the value of the plant depends\r\nmainly on right cultivation.\r\n\r\nPropagation is by seeds, or by dividing the roots. By seed is\r\npreferable. The idea that the largest kinds will not produce seed is\r\nincorrect. We raised four or five quarts of seed from a single plant of\r\nthe largest variety, in one season. Young plants are suitable for\r\ntransplanting after the first year's growth. They should be set three\r\nfeet apart each way. The soil should be thoroughly enriched and trenched\r\ntwo feet deep, with plenty of well-rotted manure in the bottom, and\r\nmixed in all the soil. Plant the crowns two or three inches below the\r\nsurface to allow stirring the ground in the spring, without injury.\r\nAfter this they will only want enriching with well-rotted manure in\r\nrather liberal quantities, worked in with a fork in the fall or spring.\r\nCovering up with manure in the fall is good. Those who raise the largest\r\nleaves, lay bare the crowns in spring, and with a sharp knife, remove\r\nall the smaller crown-buds. The leaves will be greatly reduced in\r\nnumber, but increased in size. We have often seen a single stem of a\r\nleaf that weighed a full pound.\r\n\r\nThe roots live many years. We know a single root, in St. Lawrence\r\ncounty, N. Y., from which we ate pies and tarts twenty-two years ago,\r\nand which is now so vigorous as to yield more than a supply for two\r\nfamilies through the season. The only care it has ever had, has been\r\nliberal supplies of well-rotted manure. The seed stocks have generally\r\nbeen broken off. They should always be, unless you wish to raise seed,\r\nthen save one or two of the strongest. New crowns come out on the sides,\r\nfrom year to year, until each plant will cover a considerable space. The\r\none mentioned, as being twenty-two years old, has never been moved\r\nduring the whole time. It is not the giant kind, but the leaves are\r\nlarge and long. Rhubarb has a better flavor and requires much less\r\nsugar, by blanching. This is best done by placing an old barrel, without\r\na bottom, over the hill as it begins to grow. The leaves will grow long,\r\nwith white tender stems. Use it when the leaves are half or full grown,\r\nas you please.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE.\r\n\r\nThis, in its value to the world as an article of food, is next to Indian\r\ncorn. It is the main article of diet for one third of the human race. It\r\nis produced only in certain parts of the world, and its cultivation is\r\nso simple and easy, and so much a department of agriculture by itself,\r\nthat we omit directions for growing it. The ravages of the rice-weevil,\r\nso destructive to rice lying in bulk, are prevented by the application\r\nof common salt, at the rate of half a pound to the bushel.\r\n\r\n\r\nROCKS.\r\n\r\nWe frequently find, on some of our best land, large boulders, very hard,\r\nand too large to be removed, with any team we can command, and which\r\nwould be in the way, in any place to which we might remove them. The\r\nbest way to get rid of them, when it can be afforded, is to burn or\r\nblast them into pieces small enough to be easily handled. When this can\r\nnot be afforded, the best method is to make an excavation by the side of\r\nthem, deep enough to let them sink below the reach of the plow, and\r\nallow them to fall in, being careful not to get caught by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nROLLER.\r\n\r\nThis is quite as indispensable to good farming and gardening as any\r\nother tool. It serves a great variety of useful purposes. The first is\r\nto pulverize soils. No man can get a full crop on a soil not made fine\r\non the surface, however rich that soil may be. It is often the case that\r\nland needs rolling two or three times before the last harrowing and\r\nsowing the seed. Another purpose is, on all light soils, to place the\r\nsoil close around the seeds after they have been covered. When this is\r\nnot done, seeds will vegetate very unevenly, and, in dry weather, some\r\nof them not at all. Another advantage of rolling a field-crop is the\r\ngreater facility and economy with which it can be harvested. It makes a\r\nlevel, smooth surface, sinking small stones out of the way of the scythe\r\nor reaper. Rolling makes grass-seed catch, when sown with a spring-crop.\r\nAll beds of small seeds--as onions, beets, carrots, parsnips,\r\n&c.--should be rolled after planting. It will so smooth the surface,\r\nthat hoeing and cultivating can be done without injury to the plants.\r\nThe rows are also much more easily seen while the plants are young. Any\r\ncrop will grow better and larger by not being too much exposed to the\r\naction of the atmosphere on its roots. When the soil is coarse, part of\r\nthe seeds and roots are greatly exposed to the action of the atmosphere,\r\nand this exposure is very irregular. The roller so crushes the lumps and\r\nfills up the openings in the soil as to cause the atmosphere to act\r\nregularly on the whole crop. Few farmers stop to think that the pressure\r\nof the atmosphere on their soils is fifteen pounds' weight on every\r\nsquare inch, and that, hence, the air must penetrate to a considerable\r\ndepth into the soil; and where the soil is coarse, the air enters too\r\nfreely, and acts too powerfully for the good of the plants. Rollers are\r\nmade of wood, iron, or freestone. For most purposes, wood is best. A log\r\nmade true and even, or, better, narrow plank nailed on cylindrical ends,\r\nare the usual forms. From eighteen inches to three feet in diameter is\r\nthe better size. Iron or stone rollers, in sections, are best for\r\npulverizing soil disposed to cake from being annually overflowed with\r\nwater, or from other causes.\r\n\r\n\r\nROOT CROPS.\r\n\r\nIt is important that American farmers learn to attach much greater\r\nimportance to the culture of roots. The potato is the best of all roots\r\nfor feeding; but, as the yield has become so light in most localities,\r\nand the demand for it for human food has so greatly increased, it will\r\nno longer be grown extensively as food for animals. Farmers must,\r\ntherefore, turn their attention to beets, carrots, and parsnips.\r\nReasonable tillage will produce one thousand bushels to the acre of\r\nbeets and carrots, and two hundred more of parsnips. These roots, raw or\r\ncooked, are valuable for all domestic animals. A horse will do better on\r\npart oats and part carrots, or beets, than upon clear oats. For milch\r\ncows, young stock, and fattening cattle, and for sheep and fowls, they\r\nare highly valuable. With the facilities now enjoyed, they may be raised\r\nat a cheap rate. Plant scarlet short-top radish-seed in the rows, to\r\nshade the vegetating seed and young plants, and to mark the rows, to\r\nfacilitate clearing and stirring the ground, while the plants are very\r\nyoung, and using the most approved root-cleaners, and the same amount of\r\nfood can not be grown at the same price in any other crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFFRON.\r\n\r\nThis is a well-known medicinal herb, as easily grown as a bean or\r\nsunflower. It is principally used in eruptive diseases, to induce\r\nmoisture of the skin and keep the eruption out. Sow in any good soil, in\r\nrows eighteen inches apart, and keep clean of weeds. When in full bloom,\r\nthe flowers are gathered and dried.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAGE.\r\n\r\nThis is a hardy garden-herb, easily grown. Its value for medicinal and\r\nculinary purposes is well known. It is propagated by seeds, or by\r\ndividing the roots. With suitable protection in winter, roots will live\r\nfor a number of years, bearing seed after the first.\r\n\r\n_Varieties_ are, the _red_, the _broad-leaved_, the _green_, and the\r\n_small-leaved green_. The red is most used for culinary purposes, and\r\nthe broad-leaved is most medicinal. All the varieties may be used for\r\nthe same purposes. Any garden-soil, not decidedly wet, is suitable for\r\nsage. Raise new plants once in three or four years. Plants may be\r\nrenovated, by certain culture and care, but it is better to grow new\r\nones. Cut the leaves two or three times in the season, and dry quickly,\r\nand put away in paper bags; or, better, pulverize and cork up in glass\r\nbottles. This is the best method of preserving all herbs for domestic\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALSIFY, OR VEGETABLE OYSTER.\r\n\r\nThis is a hardy biennial vegetable, resembling a small parsnip, and as\r\neasily grown. When properly cooked, its flavor resembles the oyster,\r\nwhence its name. Sow and cultivate as parsnips or carrots. It is\r\nsuitable for use from November to May. It is better for being allowed to\r\nremain in the ground until wanted for use, though it may be well kept,\r\nin moist sand in the cellar. Care is necessary in saving seed as it\r\nshells and blows away like thistle seed, as soon as ripe. It must be\r\nsown quite thick, on account of its proneness not to vegetate. It should\r\nbe more extensively cultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCRAPING LAND.\r\n\r\nThis is a process needed only on land that has not been under\r\ncultivation long enough to become level. All new land has many knolls of\r\ngreater or less size. As soon as the roots are out sufficiently to allow\r\nit, the knolls should be plowed and leveled with a common scraper. Most\r\nfarmers neglect it as injurious to the soil, and too expensive. But when\r\nwe consider that rough land never gets well plowed, and that the gradual\r\nwearing away of the knolls will continue their unproductiveness for a\r\nnumber of years, it will be seen that the cheapest way is to plow and\r\nscrape the land level at once, and thoroughly manure the places from\r\nwhich the soil has been scraped.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEDS.\r\n\r\nThe best of everything should be saved for seed. Peas, beans, corn,\r\ntomatoes, &c., should not be gathered promiscuously, finally preserving\r\nthe last that matures, for seed. Leave some of the finest and earliest\r\nstocks, and from them save seed, not from the first or the last that\r\nmatures, but from the earliest that grows large and fair. Save\r\ntomato-seed from those that grow largest, but near the root. Gather all\r\nseeds as soon as mature, as remaining exposed to the weather is\r\nunfavorable to vegetation. Dry in a warm place in the shade, but not too\r\nnear a stove or fire. Keep in paper bags, hung in a dry airy place,\r\nbeyond the reach of mice.\r\n\r\nTrying the quality of seeds is important, as it may save loss and\r\ndisappointment, from sowing seeds that will not vegetate. A little\r\ncotton wool or moss in a tumbler containing a little water, and placed\r\nin a warm room, will afford a good means of testing seeds. Seeds placed\r\non that wool, will vegetate sooner than they would do in the soil. But a\r\nmore speedy, and generally sure method, is by putting a few seeds on the\r\ntop of a hot stove. If they are good they will crack like corn in\r\nparching; otherwise they will burn without noise, and with very little\r\nmotion. The improvement or declension of fruits, grains, and vegetables,\r\ndepend very materially upon the manner of gathering and preserving\r\nseeds. Gather promiscuously and late, and keep without care, and rapid\r\ndeclension will be the result. Gather the earliest and best, and plant\r\nonly the very best of that saved, and constant improvement will be\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEEP.\r\n\r\nThese are the most profitable of all domestic animals. The original cost\r\nis trifling, and the expense of raising and keeping is so light, and the\r\nsale of meat, tallow, hide, and wool, is so ready, that sheep-growing is\r\nalways profitable. So important has this always been considered, that in\r\nall ages of the world, there have been shepherds, whose sole business it\r\nhas been to tend their flocks. Were the flesh of sheep and lambs more\r\nextensively substituted for that of swine, in this country, it would be\r\nequally healthy and economical. American farmers do not attach to\r\nsheep-growing half the importance it deserves. We recommend a thorough\r\nstudy of the subject, in the use of the facilities afforded by the\r\nwritings of practical men. We can only give the outlines of the subject\r\nin a work like this. A theory has been scientifically established by\r\nPeter A. Brown LL. D. of Philadelphia, in which it is shown that all\r\nsheep are divided into two species, Hair-bearing and Wool-bearing. These\r\nspecies crossed, produce sheep that bear both wool and hair, as the two\r\nnever change. The hair makes blankets that will not shrink. The wool is\r\ngood for making fulled cloth. Blankets made from the fleeces of sheep\r\nthat are the product of the cross of these two species, will shrink in\r\nsome places and not in others, just as the hair or wool prevails. It is\r\nalso true that the hair-bearing sheep delight in low, moist situations\r\nand sea-breezes, while the wool-bearing sheep does best on high, airy,\r\nand dry land. These fleeces all pass as wool, but the microscope shows a\r\nmarked and permanent difference, and one can easily learn to distinguish\r\nit at once, by the touch and with the naked eye. This is thrown out here\r\nto induce a thorough examination of the whole subject. There are three\r\nstaples of wool, short, three inches long, middling, five inches, and\r\nlong, eight inches. Varieties of sheep are numerous. We shall only\r\nmention a few. The question of the best breeds has been warmly\r\ncontroverted. We have no disposition to try to settle it. The question\r\nof the best variety must depend upon locality and design. If the wool is\r\nthe object, then the Vermont Merino for the North, and the pure Saxony\r\nfor the South, are evidently the best. If located near large cities,\r\nwhere the flesh is the main object, then the large-bodied, long-wooled\r\nbreeds are much preferable. Among those much esteemed we note the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\nThe _Cotswold_ mature young, and the flesh will vary in weight from\r\nfifteen to thirty pounds per quarter. The _New Leicester_ is less hardy\r\nthan the Cotswold, but heavier, weighing from twenty-four to thirty-six\r\npounds per quarter. The _Teeswater sheep_, improved by a cross with the\r\nLeicester, is considered valuable. The _Bampton_ is one of the very best\r\ngrown in England. Fat ewes average twenty pounds per quarter, and\r\nwethers from thirty to thirty-five pounds. The _Sussex_, _Hampshire,\r\nand Shropshire_ varieties of the Down sheep, are all highly esteemed.\r\nThe _Leicester_ are very valuable. An ordinary fleece weighs from three\r\nto five pounds. Mr. Joseph Beers of New Jersey had one that sheared\r\nthirteen pounds at one time, and the live weight of the sheep was 378\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nThere are _French_, _Silesian_, and _Spanish Merinoes_, much esteemed in\r\nVermont and elsewhere. The average weight of a flock of ewes of French\r\nmerinoes after shearing was 103 pounds. Their fleeces averaged twelve\r\npounds and eight ounces. The fleece of one buck of the same flock\r\nweighed twenty pounds and twelve ounces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The French Merino Ram.]\r\n\r\nThe _Silesian Merinoes_ are smaller, but produce beautiful fleeces. In a\r\nflock of nineteen ewes, the average weight of fleece was seven pounds\r\nand ten ounces, and that of the buck weighed ten and a half pounds.\r\n\r\nA large flock of _Spanish Merinoes_ yielded an average of a little over\r\nfive pounds of well-washed wool. All these varieties are valuable for\r\nwool. The wool of the pure Saxony sheep, however, is best.\r\n\r\nThe _Tartar sheep_, called also Shanghae and Broadtail, is a\r\nrecently-imported breed, of great promise for mutton. Their fleece is a\r\nfine silky hair, making fine blankets that will not shrink, but not good\r\nfor fulled cloths. The ewes are remarkably prolific, producing sometimes\r\nfive lambs at a time, and often twice a year. One ewe bore seven lambs\r\nin one year, all living and being healthy. The flesh is of the highest\r\nquality. This may stand at the head of all our sheep as a market animal.\r\nThe cross of this with our common sheep has proved fine. They need to be\r\nfurther tested in this country. A new kind of sheep has also been\r\nimported from Africa, within a few years; a variety unknown to\r\nnaturalists, but having some points in common with the Tartar sheep.\r\n\r\n_Diseases of Sheep._--There are several that have been very troublesome,\r\nbut which experience has enabled us to cure. _Scours_ is often very\r\ninjurious. A little common soot from the chimney, or pulverized\r\ncharcoal, is a sure remedy. Mix it with water, not so thick as to make\r\nit difficult to swallow, and give a teaspoonful every two hours, and\r\nrelief will soon be experienced.\r\n\r\n_Water in the head_ is a disease caused by long exposure to wet and\r\ncold. This is prevented by a small blanket on the back of the sheep. The\r\nwool on the backs of sheep will be seen to be often parted, exposing the\r\nskin. Water falling on the back will penetrate the wool and run down,\r\nand wet and chill the whole body. A small cotton blanket, fifteen inches\r\nwide, and long enough to reach from the neck to the tail, fastened to\r\nits place by tying to the wool, and painted on the outside, will cause\r\nall the water to run off, saving the health of the sheep, and causing\r\nhim to require less food. In the cold, wet season, every sheep should\r\nhave such a blanket; they would cost three or four cents each, and be\r\nworth many times their cost in the saving of feed for the animals. The\r\nmore comfortable an animal is, the less food will he require. Applying\r\ntar above the noses of sheep at shearing, that they may be compelled to\r\nsmell it and eat a little for a long time, is considered favorable to\r\ntheir general health, and a preventive of rot.\r\n\r\nThe foot-rot, in cattle, sheep, and hogs, is a prevalent disease. Boys\r\nwalking the path, barefoot, where such diseased animals frequently pass,\r\nmay contract the disease. This is always cured by washing in blue\r\nvitriol. Most cases are cured by one application, and the most confirmed\r\nby two or three. Make a narrow passage, where only one animal can pass\r\nat once. Put in a trough twelve feet long, twelve inches wide, and as\r\nmany deep. Put in that fifty pounds of blue vitriol and fill with water,\r\nthrowing a little straw over the top. Cause the diseased animals to pass\r\nthrough that, and they will be cured. This is thought to be an\r\ninvariable remedy. If sheep do not appear healthy on lowland pasture,\r\ngive them small quantities of fine charcoal and salt, and they will be\r\nas healthy as on the hills. A little salt for sheep is useful during the\r\nwhole year. The health of sheep is injured more in fall than at any\r\nother season; they are very apt to be neglected at the beginning of\r\nwinter. They grow poor rapidly when their green feed first fails; a\r\nlittle hay and grain and a few roots then will keep them up, prevent\r\ndisease, and make it less expensive to keep them through the winter.\r\nFeed in racks or troughs, when they can not get their food under foot,\r\nand as far as practicable, under shelter, and in a warm place. It is\r\nmuch cheaper, and keeps the sheep much more healthy. They should have\r\nfresh water, where they can drink, two or three times a day. Salt, mixed\r\nwith wood-ashes and pulverized charcoal, should also be constantly\r\nwithin their reach. A few beets, carrots, or parsnips, are always\r\nvaluable. Some green feed is very essential for ewes, for some time\r\nbefore the yeaning season. Corn is good for fattening sheep; but, for\r\nincreasing the wool, it is not half as valuable as beans. Good\r\nbean-straw is better than hay. Corn-fodder is excellent. The product of\r\none and a half acres of land, sowed with corn, will winter, in fine\r\ncondition, one hundred sheep--the corn sowed the 20th of June, and cut\r\nup after it has begun to lose its weight slightly, and shocked up\r\nclosely, bound round the top with straw, and then allowed to stand till\r\nwanted for feeding. To have healthy sheep, do not use a ram under two,\r\nor over six or seven years old, and raise no lambs from unhealthy ewes\r\nor rams. The expense of keeping sheep, as all other animals, is much\r\nless when they are kept warm. Much feed is wasted in keeping up animal\r\nheat, which would be saved by warm quarters.\r\n\r\nSheep-manure is better than any other, except that of fowls. No other\r\nparts with its qualities by exposure so slowly. Some farmers save all\r\nlabor of carting and spreading sheep-manure, by having movable wire\r\nfences, and putting their sheep on one acre for a few days, and then\r\nremoving to another. One hundred sheep may thus be made to manure an\r\nacre of land in ten days, better than any ordinary dressing of other\r\nmanure. We should prefer carefully collecting and saving it under cover,\r\nmixed with muck or loam, and apply where and when we choose. Keeping a\r\nsuitable number of sheep on a farm is very important in keeping up the\r\nfarm. A farm devoted to grain or vegetables, without a suitable number\r\nof animals, usually runs down.\r\n\r\nThe time when lambs should be allowed to come is important. We much\r\nprefer letting them come when they please, if we have warm quarters, and\r\ncan take a little extra care of them. This will give a larger growth,\r\nand furnish large lambs for market, at a season of the year when they\r\nare most desired, and bring the greatest price. For those who will not\r\ntake the necessary pains, let them come when the weather has become warm\r\nand grass plenty. Sometimes a ewe loses her lamb, and you wish her to\r\nraise one of another ewe's, that has two. To make a ewe own another's\r\nlamb, take off the skin of her dead lamb, and bind it on to the other\r\nlamb, and she will smell it and own the lamb; after which the skin may\r\nbe removed.\r\n\r\nSheep-culture is a subject to which farmers should give increased\r\nattention, until the average weight of sheep in the United States shall\r\nbecome one third greater than at present, and until there shall be ten\r\nsheep to one of all we have at present.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEPHERDIA OR BUFFALO BERRY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis is an ornamental shrub, growing from six to fifteen feet high,\r\nbearing a roundish red fruit, much esteemed for preserves. Trees are of\r\ntwo kinds, male and female, one bearing staminate and the other\r\npistillate flowers. Hence no fruit can be grown without setting out the\r\ntrees in pairs from six to fifteen feet apart. If you set out only two,\r\nand they chance to be of the same kind, you will get no fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOILS.\r\n\r\nThe nature and management of soils must be measurably understood by any\r\none who would be a thorough cultivator. The productive power of a soil\r\ndepends much upon the character of the subsoil. A gravelly subsoil is,\r\non the whole, the best. A thin soil lying on a cold clay subsoil--the\r\nhardpan of the East, and the crowfish clay of the West--however rich it\r\nmay be, will be unproductive; while the same soil, on a gravelly\r\nsubsoil, would produce abundantly. The best soils, for all purposes, are\r\nthe brown or hazel-colored. Plowed in wet weather, they do not make\r\nmortar, and in dry weather they will not break in clods. Dark-mixed and\r\nrusset moulds are considered the next best. The worst are the dark-gray\r\nor ash-colored. The deep-black alluvial soils of the Western prairies\r\nare an exception to all other soils, possessing, under proper treatment,\r\ngreat powers of production. Soils do not, to any considerable extent,\r\nafford food for plants. A willow-tree has been known to gain one hundred\r\nand fifty pounds' weight, without exhausting more than two or three\r\nounces of the soil, and even that might have been wasted in drying and\r\nweighing.\r\n\r\nIn our article on manures, we have shown that it is the texture of\r\nsoils, and their power to control moisture and heat, that renders them\r\nproductive: hence, no soil can be poor that is stirred deep and kept in\r\na friable condition, without being too open and porous; and no soil can\r\nbe good that is hard and not retentive of moisture, without having water\r\nstand upon it. Hence, the great secret of successful farming, is, such a\r\nmixture of the soils, and of fertilizers with the soil, as shall keep it\r\nfriable and moist, and such thorough drainage as will prevent water from\r\nstanding so as to become stagnant, and to unduly chill the roots of\r\ngrowing plants. Nature has provided, near at hand, all that is essential\r\nto productiveness; all that is necessary is to properly mix them. We do\r\nnot believe that there is an acre of land now under cultivation in the\r\nUnited States, in a latitude where corn will grow, on which we can not\r\nraise a hundred bushels of shelled Indian corn, without applying\r\nanything but what may be raised out of that soil, and procured in the\r\nshape of manure by animals in consuming that product. The poorest farm\r\nin America may be brought up to a state of great fertility, without\r\napplying one dollar's worth of any foreign substance. Plow _deep_, turn\r\nunder all the green substances possible, and feed out the products on\r\nthe farm and apply the manure, and mix opposite soils, that may be found\r\nin different localities. Three years will secure great productiveness,\r\nand the same course will increase its value, from year to year, without\r\ncost. Three things only are essential to convert poor land into the\r\nbest; deep and thorough stirring and pulverization, suitable draining,\r\nand thorough mixture of soils of different qualities, and the\r\nincorporation of such animal and vegetable substances as can be produced\r\non the land itself. We would not declare against foreign manures, but\r\ninsist that the necessary ingredients are found, or may be manufactured\r\nnear at hand. The philosophy of deep plowing and thorough pulverization\r\nis obvious. A fine soil will retain and appropriate moisture in an\r\neminent degree, on the principle of capillary attraction, or as a sponge\r\nor a piece of loaf sugar will take up water. There is also room for\r\nexcess of water to sink away from the surface, and return again when\r\nneeded. It also affords room for the roots of plants. Such a soil also\r\nreceives moisture from the atmosphere. The atmosphere also contains much\r\nwater, and more in the heat of summer than at any other time. The air\r\nalso, with a constant pressure of fifteen pounds to the square inch,\r\nenters to a considerable depth into the soil, and the deeper it is\r\nstirred, and the more thoroughly it is pulverized, the more it will\r\nenter. In coming in contact with the cool moisture below, it is\r\ncondensed and waters the soil, on the principle that a pitcher of cold\r\nwater in a warm room has large drops of water on the outside; that water\r\nis a mere condensation of moisture in the atmosphere. The cool subsoil\r\nacts in the same way upon the atmosphere at night. A deeply\r\ndisintegrated soil, also, seldom washes by rain. Shallow-plowed and\r\ncoarse land sends off the water after a slight rain, while deep-plowed\r\nand thoroughly pulverized land retains it. The philosophy of manures\r\ninvolves the same principles. All the fertilizers act upon soils in such\r\na manner as to render them fine, and open an immense surface to the\r\naction of the atmosphere, and form large reservoirs for moisture through\r\ntheir innumerable fine pores. Draining is to carry off an excess of\r\nwater that would stand on an unfavorable subsoil. That water, on\r\nundrained land, causes two evils; it stagnates and renders plants\r\nunhealthy, and it is too cool, rendering land what we call cold. Thus,\r\nthe deeper you plow land, and the finer you make it, the warmer it will\r\nbe, and the more perfectly it will control moisture. Mixing soils by\r\nsubsoiling, trenching, and deep plowing, and by carting on foreign\r\nsubstances, is wholly on this principle. Sand that drifts about with the\r\nwind is too light to retain moisture, and needs clay carted on. By this\r\nmeans the poorest white sand has often been converted into the most\r\nproductive soil. Definite rules for this mixture of soils can not be\r\nsafely given. The rules must differ in different localities and\r\ncircumstances; it must, therefore, be determined by experiment.\r\nAnalyzing soils is sometimes of use, but usually has too much importance\r\nattached. We do not advise farmers to study it. Let them try\r\napplications and mixtures, at first on a small scale: they will soon\r\nlearn what is best on their farms, and may then proceed without loss.\r\nSome lands are of such a character that the carting on, and suitably\r\nmixing, the substances in which they are deficient, may cost as much as\r\nit did to clear the land of its original forest; but it will pay well\r\nfor a long series of years. So well are we persuaded of the utility and\r\ncorrectness of these brief hints, that, in selecting a farm, we should\r\nregard the location more than the quality of the soil. The latter we\r\ncould mend easily; while we should find it difficult to move our farm to\r\na more favorable location. Poor land near a city or large town, or on\r\nsome great thoroughfare, we should much prefer to good land far removed\r\nfrom market, or in an unpleasant location.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINAGE, OR SPINACH.\r\n\r\nBoth these names are correct; the former is the general one among\r\nAmericans. This plant is used in soups, but more generally boiled alone\r\nand served as greens. In the spring of the year, this is one of the most\r\nwholesome vegetables. By sowing at different times, we may have it at\r\nany season of the year, but it is more tender and succulent in the\r\nspring. The male and female flowers are produced on separate plants. The\r\nmale blossoms are in long, terminal spikes, and the female in clusters,\r\nclose at the stalk, on each joint.\r\n\r\n_Varieties_--The two best are the _broad_, or _summer_, and the\r\n_prickly_, or _fall_. There are three others--the _English Patience\r\nDock_, the _Holland_, or _Lamb's Quarter_, and the _New Zealand_. The\r\nfirst two are sufficient. Sow in August and September for winter and\r\nspring use, and in spring for summer. Sow in rich soil, in drills\r\neighteen inches apart. Thin to three inches in the row, and when large\r\nenough for use, remove every other one, leaving them six inches apart.\r\nTo raise seed, have male plants at convenient distances, say one in two\r\nor three feet. When they have done blossoming, remove the male plants,\r\ngiving all the room to the others, for perfecting the seed. Success\r\ndepends upon very rich soil and plenty of moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\nSQUASH.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties of both summer and winter squashes. All the\r\nsummer varieties have a hard shell, when matured. They are usually eaten\r\nentire, outside, seeds and all, while young and tender, from one quarter\r\nto almost full grown. They are also used as a fall and winter squash,\r\nrejecting the shell and that portion of the inside which contains the\r\nseeds. The _Summer Crookneck_, and _Summer Scolloped_, both _white_ and\r\n_yellow_, are the principal summer squashes. The finest is the _White\r\nScolloped_. The best winter varieties are the _Acorn_, _Valparaiso_,\r\n_Winter Crookneck_, and _Vegetable Marrow_ or _Sweet Potato squash_. The\r\nlatter is the best known.\r\n\r\nCultivate as melons, but leave only two plants in a hill. They do best\r\non new land. Varieties should be grown far apart, and far removed from\r\npumpkins, as they mix very easily, and at a great distance. Bugs eat\r\nthem worse than any other garden vegetable. The only sure remedy is the\r\nbox covered with gauze or glass. As they are great runners, they do\r\nbetter with their ends clipped off. Used as a vegetable for the table,\r\nand in the same manner as pumpkins, for pies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRY.\r\n\r\nNone of our small fruits are more esteemed, or more easily raised, and\r\nyet none more frequently fails. Failures always result from\r\ncarelessness, or the want of a little knowledge of the best methods of\r\ncultivation. We omit much that might be said of the history and uses of\r\nthe strawberry, and confine ourselves to a few brief directions, which,\r\nif strictly followed, will render every cultivator uniformly successful.\r\nNo one need ever fail of growing a good crop of strawberries. In 1857,\r\nwe saw plats of strawberries in Illinois, in the cultivation of which\r\nmuch money had been expended, and which were remarkably promising when\r\nin blossom, but which did not yield the cultivators five dollars' worth\r\nof fruit. In the language of the proprietors, \"they blasted.\"\r\nStrawberries never blast; but, for the want of fertilizers at suitable\r\ndistances, they may not fill. There are but three causes of\r\nfailure--want of fertilizers, excessive drought, and allowing the vines\r\nto become too thick. Of most of our best varieties, the blossoms are of\r\ntwo kinds--pistillate and staminate, or male and female--and they are\r\nessential to each other. The pistillate plants bear the fruit, and the\r\nstaminates are the fertilizers, without which the pistillates will be\r\nfruitless. There are three kinds of blossom--pistillate, staminate, and\r\nperfect, as seen in the cut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Perfect blossom. 2. Staminate blossom. 3. Pistillate\r\nblossom.]\r\n\r\nThe first (1) is perfect; that is, has both the stamens and pistils well\r\ndeveloped: this will produce a fair crop of fruit, without the presence\r\nof any other variety. The second (2) has the stamens large, while the\r\npistils (the apparently small green strawberry in the centre) are not\r\nsufficiently developed to produce fruit: such plants seldom bear more\r\nthan a few imperfectly-formed berries. The third (3) has pistils in\r\nabundance, but is destitute of stamens, and hence, will not bear alone.\r\nThe two latter are to be placed near each other, to render them\r\nproductive; they may be readily distinguished when in blossom. It is\r\nalways safe to cultivate the hermaphrodite plants; that is, those\r\nproducing perfect blossoms; but the pistillates and staminates, in due\r\nproportions, produce the largest crops, and finer fruit.\r\n\r\n_Soil._--Much has been said against high fertilization with animal\r\nmanures, and in favor of vegetable mould only. We feel entirely\r\nsatisfied that the largest crops of strawberries are grown on land\r\nhighly manured with common barnyard manure. To plant and manure a\r\nstrawberry-bed, begin on one side, and dig a trench eighteen inches deep\r\n(from two to three feet is much better) and as wide; put six inches of\r\ncommon manure in the bottom; dig another trench as deep, and place the\r\nsoil upon the manure in the first trench; fill the last with manure as\r\nthe first, and so on over the whole plat. Manure the surface lightly\r\nwith very fine manure and wood-ashes.\r\n\r\n_Transplanting_ is usually better in the month of August. If done at\r\nthat season, and it be not too dry, the plants will get such a growth\r\nthe same season as to produce quite a good crop of fruit the next\r\nseason. Planted as early in the spring as it will do to stir the soil,\r\nthey are more sure to grow and yield a very few berries the first\r\nseason, and very abundantly the next. If you would cultivate in hills,\r\nput them two feet apart each way; if otherwise, two feet one way, and\r\none foot the other. Cut off the roots to two or three inches in length,\r\nand remove all the dead leaves; dip them in mud, which is a great means\r\nof causing them to grow; and set them in fine mould, the crown one inch\r\nbelow the level of the soil around, and leave it in a slight basin, and\r\nwater it, unless the weather be damp. Many plants are lost from not\r\nbeing set low enough to escape drought. The basin will hold water, and\r\nnearly every plant will grow; excessive water will destroy them. Set out\r\nthree or four rows of pistillate plants, and then one of the staminates,\r\nor fertilizers. Some set them out in beds and allow them to cover the\r\nwhole ground, and cultivate by spading up the bed in alternate sections\r\nof eighteen inches or two feet each year, turning under, in the spring,\r\nthat portion that bore fruit the previous season--which has long been\r\nrecommended by good authority. This was the lamented Downing's method.\r\nWe think rows preferable for this reason. The young plants formed by the\r\nrunners are less vigorous after the first; hence, the tendency is to\r\ndeterioration by this mode of culture. And this method does not afford\r\nso good an opportunity for stirring the soil around the plants as\r\nplanting in rows; this stirring the soil is a great means of protecting\r\nfrom drought, and securing the most vigorous growth. Deep subsoiling\r\nbetween the rows early in the spring, or after fruiting, is valuable;\r\nhence, we always advise to cultivate in hills two feet apart each way,\r\nand renew them after they have borne two, or at most three crops.\r\n\r\nHermaphrodites are best for cultivation in beds. Many strawberry-beds do\r\nwell the first year of their bearing, but are almost useless afterward.\r\nThe cultivator says they all run to vines. In such cases, they overlook\r\nthe fact that the staminate plants grow altogether the fastest, because\r\ntheir strength goes to support foliage in the absence of fruit, while\r\nbearing vines require much of their strength to mature the fruit; hence,\r\nif they are allowed to run together the second, or at most the third\r\nyear, the fertilizers will monopolize the ground and prevent fruiting.\r\nThis is the greatest cause of failure of a crop, next to a want of both\r\nkinds of plants. This is the origin of fears of having land too rich. It\r\nis said it all runs to vines without fruit; this is because the wrong\r\nvines have intruded--the staminates have overcome the pistillates. We\r\nreject the whole theory of the luxuriance of the vines preventing the\r\nproduction of fruit. The larger the vines the more fruit, provided only\r\nthe vines are bearers, and not too thick: hence this invariable\r\nrule--_always have fertilizers within five feet, and never allow the two\r\nkinds to run together._ Manures should be applied in August, well spaded\r\nin. Applying in the spring to increase the crop for that season, is like\r\nfeeding chickens in the morning to fatten them for dinner--it is too\r\nlate. Fertilizing in August is a good preparation for a large crop for\r\nthe next season. Strawberry-vines, in all freezing climates, should be\r\ncovered, late in the fall, with forest-leaves or straw, to protect from\r\nthe severity of winter, and enrich the land by what can be dug into the\r\nsoil in spring. Rotten wood, fine chips, sawdust, &c., are all good for\r\na fall top-dressing. After well hoeing and weeding in spring, until\r\nblossom-buds appear, just before the blossoms open, cover the bed\r\nthoroughly with spent tanbark, sawdust, or fine straw. This will keep\r\ndown weeds, preserve moisture in the soil, enrich the ground, and\r\nprotect the fruit from injury by rains, and in part from worms and\r\ninsects. This should never be omitted.\r\n\r\n_Varieties_ are numerous, and, from the ease with which they are raised\r\nfrom seed, will rapidly increase; it is so frequent to have blossoms\r\nfertilized by pollen from several different varieties. Some of the most\r\nmarked varieties are known in different parts of the country by very\r\ndifferent names; hence, we advise cultivators to select the best in\r\ntheir locality. Every valuable variety is soon scattered over the\r\ncountry. The following are good:--\r\n\r\n_Burr's New Pine._--Originated at Columbus, Ohio, in 1856. Hardy,\r\nvigorous, and quite productive; very early; tender for market, but\r\nsuperior for a private garden.\r\n\r\n_Western Queen._--Originated at Cleveland, Ohio, by Professor J. P.\r\nKirtland, 1849. Very hardy and productive; larger than the Hudson or the\r\nWilley; good for market; bears carriage well.\r\n\r\n_Longworth's Prolific._--Origin, Cincinnati, 1848. Regular, sure, full\r\nbearer of large, delicious fruit; good for market; an independent\r\nbearer.\r\n\r\n_M'Avoy's Superior._--Cincinnati, 1848. Received one-hundred-dollar\r\nprize from the Cincinnati Horticultural Society in 1851. Exceedingly\r\nlarge; hardy; female or pistillate flowers; needs fertilizers, and then\r\nis one of the best ever grown; rather tender for carriage, though it is\r\nextensively sold in Western markets.\r\n\r\n_Jenney's Seedling._--Valuable for ripening late; fruit large and\r\nregular; very productive, 3,200 quarts having been gathered from three\r\nquarters of an acre.\r\n\r\n_Hovey's Seedling._--Elliott puts it in his second class; but we can not\r\navoid the conviction that it is one of the best that ever has been\r\nraised. It is pistillate, but with fertilizers it yields immense crops,\r\nof very fine large fruit. Boston Pine is one of the best fertilizers for\r\nthe Hovey Seedling.\r\n\r\n_Hudson Bay._--A hardy and late variety, highly esteemed.\r\n\r\n_Pyramidal Chilian._--Hermaphrodite, highly valued.\r\n\r\n_Crimson Cone._--An old variety, quite early, and something of a\r\nfavorite in Eastern markets.\r\n\r\n_Peabody's New Hautbois._--Originated in Columbus, Georgia, by Charles\r\nA. Peabody. Said to bear more degrees of heat and cold than any other\r\nvariety. Very vigorous, fruit of the largest size, very many of the\r\nberries measuring seven inches in circumference. Flesh firm, sweet, and\r\nof a delicious pine-apple flavor. Rich, deep crimson. It may be seen in\r\nfull size in the patent office report on agriculture for 1856. If this\r\nnew fruit sustains its recommendations, it will prove the best of all\r\nstrawberries.\r\n\r\nDowning describes over one hundred varieties. We repeat our\r\nrecommendation to select the best you can find near home. The following\r\nrules will insure success:\r\n\r\n1. Make the ground very rich.\r\n\r\n2. Put fertilizers within five feet of each other, and never allow\r\ndifferent kinds to run together.\r\n\r\n3. Cover the ground two inches deep with tan-bark, sawdust, or fine\r\nstraw, just before the blossoms open; tan-bark is best.\r\n\r\n4. Never allow the vines to become very thick, but thin them out.\r\n\r\n5. Water every day from the appearance of the blossoms until done\r\ngathering the fruit; this increases the crop largely, and, at the South,\r\nhas continued the vines in bearing until November. Daily watering will\r\nprolong the bearing season greatly in all climates, and greatly increase\r\nthe crop.\r\n\r\n6. Protect in winter by a slight covering of forest-leaves, coarse\r\nstraw, or cornstalks.\r\n\r\n7. To get a late crop, keep the vines covered deep with straw. You can\r\nretard their maturity two weeks, and daily watering will prolong it for\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n8. Apply, twice in the fall and once in the spring, a solution of\r\npotash, one pound in two pails of water, or two pounds in a barrel of\r\nwater in which stable-manure has been soaked.\r\n\r\n9. The best general applications to the soil, in preparing the bed, are\r\nlime, charcoal, and wood-ashes--one part of lime to two of ashes and\r\nthree of charcoal. The application of wood-ashes will render less\r\ndissolved potash necessary.\r\n\r\nThese nine rules, strictly observed, will render every cultivator\r\nsuccessful in all climates and localities.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR.\r\n\r\nThere have, until recently, been but two general sources of our supply\r\nof sugar--the sugar-cane of the South, and the sugar-maple of the North.\r\nBeet-sugar will not be extensively manufactured in this country. We now\r\nhave added the Sorgho, or Chinese sugar-cane, and the Imphee, or African\r\nsugar-cane, adapted to the North and the South, flourishing wherever\r\nIndian corn will grow, and raised as easily and surely, and much in the\r\nsame way. Of the methods of making sugar from the old sugar-cane of the\r\nSouth, we need give no account. It is not an article of general domestic\r\nmanufacture. It is made on a large scale on plantations, and is in\r\nitself simple, and easily learned by the few who become sugar-planters.\r\n\r\nThe process of manufacturing sugar from the maple-tree is very simple\r\nand everywhere known. It is to be regretted that our sugar-maples are\r\nbeing so extensively destroyed, and that those we pretend to keep for\r\nsugar-orchards are so unmercifully hacked up, in the process of\r\nextracting the sap. To so tap the trees as to do them the least possible\r\ninjury, is a matter of much importance. Whether it should be done by\r\nboring and plugging up with green maple-wood after the season is over,\r\nor be done by cutting a small gash with an axe and leaving open, has\r\nbeen a disputed point. Many prefer the axe, and think the tree will be\r\nless blackened in the wood, and will last longer, provided it be\r\njudiciously performed. Cut a small, smooth gash; one year tap the tree\r\nlow, and another high, and on alternate sides; scatter the wounds, made\r\nfrom year to year, as much as possible. Another process of tapping is\r\nnow most popular with all who have tried it. Bore into the tree half an\r\ninch, with a bit not larger than an inch, slanting slightly up, that\r\nstanding sap or water may not blacken the wood. Make the spout out of\r\nhoop-iron one and a fourth inches wide; cut the iron, with a cold\r\nchisel, into pieces four inches long; grind one end sharp; lay the\r\npieces over a semicircular groove in a stick of hard wood, and place an\r\niron rod on it lengthwise over the groove--slight blows with a hammer\r\nwill bend it. These can be driven into the bark, below the hole made by\r\nthe bit. They need not extend to the wood, and hence make no wound at\r\nall. If the wound dries before the season is over, deepen it a little by\r\nboring again, or by taking out a small piece with a gouge. This process\r\nwill injure the trees less than any other. The spouts will be cheaper\r\nthan wooden ones, and may last twenty years. Always hang buckets on\r\nwrought nails, that may be drawn out. Buckets made of tin, to hold three\r\nor four gallons, need cost only about twenty-five cents each, and, with\r\ngood care, may last twenty years. A crook in the wire of the rim will\r\nmake a good place to hang upon the nail. A hole bored in the ear of\r\nother buckets will answer the same purpose. In all windy situations, the\r\nbucket must be near the end of the spout, or much will be lost by being\r\nblown over by the wind. Great care to keep all vessels used, clean and\r\nsweet, and not burn the sugar in finishing it, will enable any one to\r\nsucceed in making good maple-sugar. The various forms in which it is put\r\nup, and the manner of draining, are familiar to all makers. It is only\r\nnecessary to add, that there are few small farms on which the\r\nsugar-maple will grow, where there might not be raised two or three\r\nhundred maples, within fifteen or twenty years, that would add greatly\r\nto the beauty, comfort, and value of the farm. On the highway as\r\nshade-trees, or on the side of lots, they would be very ornamental and\r\nprofitable, without doing injury. We can not too strongly recommend\r\nraising sugar-maples. Always cultivate trees that will bear fruit, yield\r\nsugar, or be good for timber.\r\n\r\nSorgho, or Chinese sugar-cane, is raised much as Indian corn--only, it\r\nwill bear some ten or twelve stalks in a hill, instead of three or four.\r\nIn all parts of our continent, it produces enormous crops of stalks. The\r\ntrials thus far indicate, that the quantity of saccharine matter it\r\ncontains is not quite equal to that of the common sugar-cane; but, with\r\nthe necessary facilities for manufacturing, it makes quite as good sugar\r\nand as fine sirups as the other cane. Suitable machinery, that need not\r\nbe expensive, owned by a neighborhood of farmers, may enable all\r\nNorthern men, where other cane will not grow, to make their own sugar\r\ncheaper than to buy. But it will be made probably by large\r\nestablishments as other sugar. We give no method of making it. The\r\nsubject is so new, that every method of manufacture finds its way into\r\nall the newspapers, and what might appear the best to-day would be\r\nquite antiquated to-morrow. We have seen as fine sugars and sirups, of\r\nall the different grades, made from this new cane, as any others we have\r\never tasted. The question is settled that imphee and sorgho will make\r\ngood sugar in abundance. A few years will place such sugars among the\r\ngreat staple products of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMER-SAVORY.\r\n\r\nThis is a hardy annual, raised from seed on any good soil, with no care\r\nbut keeping free from weeds. The seed is small, and may not vegetate\r\nwell in dry, warm weather, without a little shade or regular watering.\r\nIts use for culinary and medicinal purposes is well known. Gather and\r\ndry when nearly ripe. Keep in paper bags, or pulverize and put in glass\r\nbottles. For the benefit of persons who keep those sprightly pets called\r\nfleas, we mention the fact that dry summer-savory leaves, put in the\r\nstraw beds, will expel those insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNFLOWER.\r\n\r\nThis large, hardy, annual plant would be considered very beautiful, were\r\nit not so common. Three quarts of clear, beautiful oil are expressed\r\nfrom a bushel of the seed, in the same way as linseed-oil. The seed, in\r\nsmall quantities, is good for fowls. It may be grown with less labor\r\nthan corn.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET POTATO.\r\n\r\nThis is a Southern plant, but is now being acclimated in Northern\r\nlatitudes. Good sweet potatoes are now grown in the colder parts of\r\nVermont, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. There are many varieties, and they\r\nare increasing by seedlings. Not long since, they were said to bear no\r\nseed; but recently, in different parts of the country, seeds have been\r\nfound, and new varieties grown from them. Certain varieties are best in\r\ndifferent localities. They will always find their way through growers of\r\nplants. The process of growing is simple, but must be carefully followed\r\nto insure success. Plant the seed potatoes in a moderate hotbed, at the\r\ntime when grass begins to start freely. Keep well watered, and do not\r\nallow them to get too warm. An hour's over-heating will cause them all\r\nto decay. The heat, when it begins to rise too high, is at once checked\r\nby a thorough drenching with cold water: if too low, the heat is raised\r\nby a tight cover, in a warm sun, and by watering with warm water. Water\r\nthem every day after they are up. The sprouts, when six inches high, are\r\npulled off from the potato, and set out as cabbage-plants; this should\r\nbe done as soon as all danger of frost has ceased. The same potatoes\r\nwill sprout as many times as they are pulled off.\r\n\r\nSweet potatoes need much sun and warmth; they are, therefore, planted on\r\nround hills, or, better, on ridges, which may be principally thrown up\r\nwith a plow, and made from a foot to eighteen inches high. Set the\r\nplants in the top, about fifteen inches or two feet apart; keep clear of\r\nweeds, making the hill or ridge a little larger by each hoeing. The\r\ntops, being long running vines, will soon cover the ground. They produce\r\nbetter tubers for throwing the vines, in a twist, up over the top of the\r\nrows. They will take root at each joint of vine, when undisturbed, which\r\nroots will draw from the main tuber. These roots would be as good and\r\nlarge as any, if they had time: hence, at the South, one half of the\r\ncrop is grown from sets, from cuttings of the ends of the early-planted\r\nvines. At the North, where seasons are short, these joints must be\r\nprevented--by throwing up, as above, or loosening--from taking root. The\r\ntubers will need all the strength; the plant and tuber are tender, and a\r\nlittle frost will kill the vines and cause the potatoes to decay. They\r\nmay be kept for use until January by packing, when dug in a warm day, in\r\nthe soil in which they grew;--kept through winter, packed in straw or\r\nchaff, in boxes that will contain about two or three bushels each, and\r\nkept in a room with a fire: the room should be at a temperature of from\r\nforty to sixty degrees; fifty-five is best, though seventy will not\r\ndestroy them; more or less will cause them to decay. The boxes may be\r\nplaced one upon another, but should be left open, that their moisture\r\nmay evaporate. Dry sand (kiln-dried), sifted over and close among them,\r\nwill preserve them. Free circulation of air is indispensable. It is\r\nusually cheapest to buy the plants of those who make a business of\r\nraising them. They are very hardy--may be transported one thousand miles\r\nand do just as well. To transplant with perfect safety in a dry time,\r\nafter the plant has been put in its place, pour in a pint of water, and\r\ncover it with a little dry soil to prevent baking--and not one out of\r\nfifty will perish.\r\n\r\nThese few brief directions will enable any one to be successful wherever\r\ncorn will grow. A new variety has just been brought into Alabama from\r\nPeru, that is pronounced superior to all others; a prodigious bearer,\r\neven on poor sandy land, and far more hardy than other varieties, the\r\nroot retaining its excellence as it came out of the ground till the\r\nfollowing May.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWINE.\r\n\r\nHogs are evil in their propensities, mischievous and filthy in their\r\nhabits, and yet profitable to the farmer. Every farmer should keep a few\r\nin proportion to the refuse grain and various slops that his\r\nestablishment may afford. Buying hogs and then purchasing grain on which\r\nto fatten them in the usual way is the poorest economy. Such pork is\r\noften made to cost from twelve to twenty cents per pound.\r\n\r\nThere are many breeds of swine highly recommended. Some of the varieties\r\nof the Chinese are the most prolific and have the greatest tendency to\r\nfattening of any known. They have formed the basis of the great\r\nimprovements in the breeds in Great Britain. Farmers will be able to\r\nselect the best breed from their own knowledge and observation, better\r\nthan from any directions we can give them. Every new variety will be\r\nintroduced by dealers, and farmers must be cautious how they accept\r\ntheir representations.\r\n\r\n_Age of Swine for Pork._--It is most profitable and least troublesome,\r\nto keep over winter, no swine but breeding sows, to have pigs early in\r\nspring, to kill in autumn. Of any of the good breeds, they can be made\r\nto weigh from 300 to 350 pounds, by the proper time for killing. The\r\npractice of keeping swine till eighteen or twenty-four months old, and\r\nonly fattening them late in the fall and beginning of winter, is very\r\nunprofitable. It is best to give pigs about what they will eat, from the\r\ntime of beginning to feed them until they are slaughtered. This is in\r\nevery way most economical. It secures fattening in the hot weather in\r\nsummer, when pork can be made faster and cheaper than at any other time.\r\nMany farmers begin to fatten their pork, after the season in which it\r\ncan most rapidly and cheaply be done.\r\n\r\nHogs having been kept poor, on being fed freely for fattening, become\r\ncloyed, and much time is lost, while those that always have had what\r\nthey would eat, of good wholesome food, always have a good appetite for\r\nas much as they need, and not root over and injure more.\r\n\r\n_Food for Swine._--They do better shut up in a pen, but where they can\r\nget access to the ground. All edible roots are good and all the grains.\r\nBut grain should be ground or soaked. It pays well to cook all food for\r\nswine. Boiled potatoes, carrots, beets, and parsnips, are all good.\r\nGround feed should be mixed with cooked vegetables. The disposition that\r\nswine have to root deep in the ground, indicates the want of something,\r\nnot found in sufficient quantities in their ordinary food. Numerous\r\nexperiments show that that deficiency is abundantly supplied by having\r\ncharcoal within their reach. The stories of fattening pork wholly on\r\ncharcoal, which we find in the books, we do not credit. But that small\r\nquantities of it are uniformly healthy for swine, is an established\r\nfact. The question of sour food has many respectable advocates.\r\nCultivators and writers take different sides of the question, based as\r\nthey say upon their carefully-tried and noted experiments, one affirming\r\nthat fermented food is superior, and others that it has done his hogs\r\npositive injury. This discrepancy grows out of not carefully\r\ndistinguishing the different kinds of fermentation, the sweet, the\r\nvinous, the acid, and the putrid. The first makes excellent food, the\r\nsecond will do quite well, the third is injurious, and the last\r\nabsolutely poisonous. As it requires much care and observation to get\r\nthis right, and mistakes are easy, it is best to take the sure method,\r\ngive them food in a natural state, ground, and either cooked or fed raw.\r\nEither will make good pork at a reasonable cost, but cooked food is\r\npreferable.\r\n\r\nSows are prevented from destroying their young by quiet, plenty of food,\r\nand little animal food, and but a very little straw in a dry pen, or\r\nwashing the pig's backs with a strong decoction of aloes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOBACCO.\r\n\r\nThis is a plant abhorred by everything but man and the tobacco-worm. Its\r\nuse for chewing and snuffing is happily becoming more and more offensive\r\nto refined society, and we hope it may, after a long struggle, go out of\r\nuse. For those who will cultivate it as an article of commerce, the\r\nfollowing brief directions are sufficient. Burn over a small bed, on\r\nwhich sow the seed early in March. When the leaves are as large as a\r\nquarter of a dollar, transplant them in deep, rich soil, or on new land,\r\nin rows three feet apart each way, or four feet one way and two the\r\nother. Tend as cabbage. It is necessary, twice in the season, to\r\ndestroy, by hand, the large green worms that feed on this plant. When\r\nthe plants are from two and a half to three and a half feet high,\r\naccording to the richness of the soil on which they grow, pick out the\r\nhead or blossom-buds, except in the few plants you would have go to\r\nseed. Pinch off also the suckers, or shoots behind the leaves, as they\r\ncome out. When the leaves are full grown and begin to ripen, which is\r\nknown by the small, dusky spots appearing on the leaves, cut up the\r\nstalks and lay them down singly to wilt; when they are thoroughly\r\nwilted, lay them together, that they may sweat for forty-eight hours,\r\nthen hang them up in a tolerably tight room to dry--hang across poles,\r\none on each side. A sharp stick put through the but of the stalks and\r\nlaid over the pole, leaving one stalk on each side, is a very good\r\nmethod. When it becomes well dried, pick off the leaves, and tie the\r\nstems together in small bunches, and pack away in hogsheads or boxes, in\r\na dry place.\r\n\r\nWe recommend to every agriculturist to cultivate a little tobacco--not\r\nfor himself or others to chew, snuff, or smoke, but to use in destroying\r\ninsects. A strong decoction, used in washing animals, will destroy lice\r\non horses and cattle, and ticks on sheep. Tobacco-water applied to\r\nplants, or trees, will effectually destroy all insects with which they\r\nmay be infested. Boil tobacco-stems or stalks, or the refuse-tobacco of\r\nthe cigar-makers, until you make a strong decoction, and apply with a\r\nsyringe, or in any other way, and it will prove more effectual than\r\nanything else known. Tobacco-stems, stalks, or leaves, laid around\r\npeach-trees in the month of May, will protect them from the attacks of\r\nthe borer. This is also a good manure for peach-trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATO.\r\n\r\nThis vegetable is well known, and has recently come to be generally\r\nesteemed. It can always be grown without failure, and more easily and at\r\none fourth of the cost of potatoes. Its use for cooking, eating raw,\r\nand pickling in various forms, is known to all. There are several\r\nvarieties. The best of all is the large red--not the largest, but the\r\nsmooth ones: although smaller, they contain more, and are much more\r\nconveniently used, than the very large rough or scolloped variety. The\r\nlarge yellow are less liable to decay on the vines, and have less of the\r\ntomato taste. The small plum-tomato, both red and yellow, and the pear\r\nor bell-shaped, are good for preserving as a common sweetmeat, and for\r\npickling whole. They should be started in early hotbed--in February in\r\nthe Middle States--and transplanted after frosts are over, in rows eight\r\nfeet apart each way. That distance will leave none too much room for\r\nletting in the sun and for the convenience of picking. They will mature\r\non the poorest land; but the amount of the crop is graduated altogether\r\nby the richness of the soil, and the care given them. They will produce\r\nfrequently a bushel to a vine, lying on the ground. But they ripen\r\nbetter, and as the vines are not injured by picking the early ones, they\r\nwill produce more, by being trained up. A few sticks to hold them up at\r\nfirst, and let them break down over them later, is of no use. Train\r\nthem, and tie up all the principal bunches, and they will be greatly\r\nbenefited thereby. Tied to slats, or any board fence, in a kind of\r\nfan-training form, they do very well. In all cities and villages, enough\r\nfor a large family can be grown on twenty-five feet of board-fence,\r\nexposed to the southern or eastern sun, and not occupy the ground a\r\nsingle foot from the fence. Drive in nails, and tie up the branches as\r\nthey grow. Removing some of the branches and leaves, and letting in the\r\nsun, or placing the fruit on a shingle or stone, hastens its ripening.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOOLS.\r\n\r\nIt is no part of our design to go into any general description of\r\nagricultural implements. There are constant changes and improvements,\r\nand they are introduced at once to the whole country by the inventors or\r\ndealers. We also wish to avoid all participation in the controversies\r\nrespecting the merits of various new inventions. We have several forms\r\nof cultivators, horse-hoes, subsoil-plows, drills, seed-sowers,\r\nland-diggers, and drainers, various formed plows, root-cleaners,\r\ncorn-planters, &c., &c. These possess different degrees of merit; all\r\nhave their day, and will be superseded by others, in the general\r\nadvancement that marks the science of soil-culture. We strongly\r\nrecommend the use of the best tools, especially subsoil-plows,\r\nseed-planters, and root-cleaners. Always have a tool-house, as much as\r\nyou do a kitchen. Use the best tools; never lay them down but in their\r\nproper place; and always clean them before putting them away. Keep all\r\nthe wood-work of tools well painted, and the iron and steel in a\r\ncondition, by the application of oil and otherwise, to prevent rust.\r\nGood tools facilitate and cheapen cultivation, and increase the yield of\r\ncrops, Money paid out for such tools is well expended.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAINING.\r\n\r\nThis is a matter that has received much attention from all\r\nfruit-growers. The influence of different modes of training and pruning\r\nis very great on the bearing qualities of trees. The peculiarities\r\ndemanded by the various fruit-trees, vines, and bushes, are given under\r\nthese articles respectively. We give here only some general principles.\r\nThe health, beauty, and profit, of most fruit-trees depend upon\r\njudicious pruning and training. The following are the general objects:--\r\n\r\n1. To secure regular growth and prevent deformities, and thus promote\r\nthe health of trees.\r\n\r\n2. To secure a sufficient number of fruit-bearing shoots, and in right\r\nlocations, and to throw sufficient sap into those shoots to enable them\r\nto mature the fruit. With a certain amount of pruning, you may double\r\nthe quantity of fruit, or destroy half that the trees would have\r\nproduced if not trained at all. One half of the fruit of any orchard\r\ndepends upon correct pruning. It also has a great influence upon the\r\nquality of fruit. The cherry is almost the only fruit-tree that throws\r\nout nearly the right number of branches, and in the right places. It\r\nneeds a very little direction while young, and afterward only the\r\nremoval of decaying branches. The quince needs considerable trimming at\r\nfirst; but, the head once formed, it will need very little\r\nafter-pruning. Next comes the plum, needing, perhaps, a little more\r\npruning than the cherry or quince, but much less than the other fruits.\r\nThe plum is apt to throw out strong branches, in some directions, quite\r\nout of proportion with the rest of the top. Such need shortening in, to\r\ndistribute the sap equally through the tree, and thus produce a\r\nsymmetrical form. This is all the trimming necessary. The roots of a\r\nplum-tree are usually stronger than the top, and absorb more than the\r\nleaves can digest; hence some of its diseases. The natural remedy would\r\nbe root-pruning, and leaving the top in its natural state, except\r\nshortening-in the disproportioned branches. Removing much of the top of\r\na plum-tree would ordinarily prove injurious. The apple needs\r\nconsiderable pruning, but not of the spurs and side-twigs which bear the\r\nfruit, but of limbs that grow too thick, and of disproportioned\r\nluxuriance. (See under Apple.) So the pear must be often slightly pruned\r\nto check the too vigorous growth and encourage the too tardy. The peach\r\nmust be so pruned as to prevent the long bare poles so often seen, and\r\nto secure annually the growth of a large number of shoots for next\r\nyear's bearing, and to check the flow of the sap by cutting off the ends\r\nof the growing young shoots, so as to cause the formation on each, of a\r\nfew vigorous fruit-buds. Peach-trees, so pruned, will be healthy and do\r\nwell for fifty years, and produce a larger number of better peaches than\r\nwill grow on trees left in the usual way. By a system of pruning that\r\nwill equalize the growth and strength, the bearing will be general on\r\nall the branches of the tree. This will make the fruit more abundant and\r\nof better quality. The following six principles--first stated by M.\r\nDubreuil, of France, and since presented to the American people in\r\nBarry's \"Fruit-Garden,\" and still later in Elliott's \"Fruit-Book\"--will\r\nguide any attentive cultivator into the correct method of pruning and\r\ntraining:--\r\n\r\n1. The vigor of a tree, subject to pruning, depends, in a great measure,\r\nupon the equal distribution of sap in all its branches.\r\n\r\n2. The sap acts with greater force, and produces more vigorous growth on\r\na branch pruned short than on one pruned long.\r\n\r\n3. The sap, tending always to the extremities, causes the terminal\r\nshoots to push with more vigor than the laterals.\r\n\r\n4. The more the sap is obstructed in its circulation, the more likely it\r\nwill be to produce fruit-buds.\r\n\r\n5. The leaves serve to prepare the sap for the nourishment of the tree,\r\nand to aid in the formation of fruit-buds. Therefore, trees deprived of\r\ntheir foliage are liable to perish, and they are injured in proportion\r\nto their defoliation.\r\n\r\n6. When the buds of any shoot or branch do not develop before the age of\r\ntwo years, they can only be forced into activity by very close pruning;\r\nand this will often fail, especially in the peach.\r\n\r\nObserve the foregoing, and never cut large limbs from any tree, except\r\nin grafting an old tree (and then only graft a part of the top in one\r\nyear, especially in the pear), and of old, neglected peach-trees, to\r\nrenew the top, and any careful cultivator can raise an orchard of\r\nhealthy, beautiful, and profitable trees. There are different forms of\r\ntraining that have gone the rounds of the fruit-books, that are nearly\r\nall more fanciful than useful. There are four forms of fan-training, and\r\nseveral of horizontal and conical. The following only are useful:--\r\n\r\n_Fan-Training._--A tree but one year from the graft, or bud, is planted\r\nand headed down to within four buds of the ground, the buds so situated\r\nas to throw out two shoots on each side (see fan-training, first stage).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fan-training, 1st stage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fan-training, 2d stage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fan-training, 3d stage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fan-training, Complete.]\r\n\r\nThe following season, the two upper shoots are to be cut back to three\r\nbuds, so as throw out one leading shoot, and one shoot on each side. The\r\ntwo lower shoots are to be cut back to two buds, so as to throw out one\r\nleading shoot, and one shoot on the upper side. In this second stage,\r\nyou will have a tree with five leading shoots on each side (see cut,\r\nfan-training, 2d stage). These shoots form the future tree, and should\r\nneither be shortened in, nor allowed to bear fruit this year.\r\n\r\nEach shoot should now be allowed to produce three shoots, one leading\r\none, and two others on the upper side, one near the bottom, and the\r\nother half way up the stem. All others should be pinched off when they\r\nfirst appear. At the end of the third year you will have the appearance\r\nin the cut (Fan-training, third stage). After this it may bear fruit,\r\nbut not too much, as a young tree so trained, is disposed to\r\nover-bearing. These shoots, except the leading ones, should be shortened\r\nback; but to what length depends upon the vigor of the tree. This is to\r\nbe continued and extended as the grower may choose, always preventing\r\nthe top from becoming too dense, and the shoot too long for a proper\r\nflow of sap, and maturity of fruit-buds. A good form, though slightly\r\nirregular, is seen in the cut (Fan-training, complete). Such trees\r\ntrained against walls, or better, on trellis-work, are beautiful and\r\nvery productive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Horizontal Training, first stage.]\r\n\r\n_Horizontal Training_ is another form contributing to fruitfulness, by\r\nregulating the flow of the sap. This is done by preserving an upright\r\nleader with lateral shoots at regular distances. To secure this, such\r\nshoots as you wish to train must be tied in a horizontal position, and\r\nall others pinched off on first appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Horizontal Training, fourth year.]\r\n\r\nThe process is simple and easy, continued as long as you please. Head in\r\nthe shoots of these lateral branches to two or three buds and they will\r\nbear abundantly. As the growth increases, remove all that are not in the\r\nright places, and train all you spare, as before. In the fourth year,\r\nyou will have trees of the appearance in the cut (Horizontal Training,\r\nfourth year).\r\n\r\n_Conical Training._--The Quenouille (pronounced _kenoole_) of the\r\nFrench, is the best of all forms of training, especially for the pear.\r\nTo produce conical standards, plant young trees four or five feet high,\r\nand after the first year's growth, head back the top, and cut in the\r\nside branches, as in the cut (Progressive stages of conical training).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Progressive stages of Conical Training.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Conical Training complete.]\r\n\r\nThe next season several tiers of side branches will shoot out. The\r\nlowest should be left about eighteen inches from the ground, and by\r\npinching off a part, others may be made to grow, at such distances as\r\nyou may desire. At the end of the second year, the leader is headed back\r\nto increase the growth of the side shoots. The laterals will constantly\r\nincrease, and you must save only a sufficient number. The third or\r\nfourth year, the lateral branches may be bent down and tied to stakes.\r\nThe branches must be tied down from year to year, and the top so\r\nshortened in as to prevent too vigorous growth, and throw the sap into\r\nthe laterals. This may be continued until the tree will exhibit the\r\nappearance in the cut (conical training complete). When the tree has\r\nbecome thoroughly formed it will retain its shape without keeping the\r\nbranches tied. The fan and horizontal training are valuable for fruits\r\nthat need winter protection, and they are also very ornamental, and\r\nenable us to cultivate much fruit on a small place. All these forms of\r\ntraining increase largely the productiveness of fruit-trees. It is\r\nrecommended for all small gardens and yards, and will pay in growing\r\nfruit for market.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPLANTING.\r\n\r\nTrees should be transplanted in spring in cold climates, and in autumn\r\nin warm regions. The top should be lessened about as much as the roots\r\nhave been by removal. Cutting off so large a part of the top as we often\r\nsee is greatly injurious. Trees frequently lose one or two years'\r\ngrowth, by being excessively trimmed when transplanted. The leaves are\r\nthe lungs of the tree, and how can it grow if they are mostly removed?\r\nAll injured roots should be cut off smoothly on the lower side, slant\r\nout from the tree, and just above the point of injury. Places for the\r\ntrees should be prepared as given under the different fruits and the\r\ntrees set firmly in them an inch lower than they stood in the nursery.\r\nThe great point is to get the fine mould very close around all the\r\nroots, leaving them in the most natural position. Trees dipped in a\r\nbucket of soil or clay and water, thick enough to form a coat like\r\npaint, just at the time of transplanting, are said to be less liable to\r\ndie. Every transplanted tree should have a stake, and be thoroughly\r\nmulched. Trees properly transplanted will grow much faster, and bear a\r\nyear or two earlier, than those that have been carelessly set out. For\r\nfurther remarks on this important matter, see under the different\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURNIP.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the great root crops of England, and to considerable\r\nextent in this country, for feeding purposes. We think it should be\r\ndisplaced, mostly, by beets, carrots, and parsnips. They are more\r\nnutritious, as easily raised, and more conveniently fed. The Rutabaga is\r\na productive variety, and possesses a good deal of nutriment. The\r\nessentials in raising good turnips of most varieties, are very rich\r\nsoil, worked deep, and finely pulverized. They should stand in rows two\r\nfeet apart, and one foot apart in the rows. They may be mainly tended\r\nwith a small cultivator or root-cleaner.\r\n\r\nEnglish turnips are extensively grown as a second crop on wheat stubble,\r\n&c. The soil is highly enriched and the seed sown in rows to allow\r\ncultivation. The best method, however, is to turn over old greensward\r\nsay June 1, and yard cattle or sheep on it till July 10, and then harrow\r\nthoroughly, and sow the seed broadcast. The yield will usually be large,\r\nand they will need very little weeding. If it is not convenient to yard\r\ncattle on the turnip-ground, apply fifteen double wagon loads of fine\r\nmanure with a few bushels of lime to the acre, and the crop will be\r\nlarge. The usual time of sowing turnips is from the 10th to the 25th of\r\nJuly. We think the yield is larger when sown by the middle of June. The\r\nonly way to get good early turnips is to sow them very early. The flat,\r\nor common field turnip, is easily grown on new land, or on any rich soil\r\ntolerably free from weeds and not infested with worms.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT.\r\n\r\nThis is the most highly esteemed of all grains, and has more enemies,\r\nand is more affected in its growth by the weather, than any other. It\r\nhas engaged more attention in the study and writings of agriculturists\r\nthan all other cereals. The outlines only of the results of the vast\r\nfield of investigation and experiment on wheat-growing can be presented\r\nhere. There are doubts respecting the origin of wheat. The more general\r\nand probable theory is, that it is the product of the cultivation, for a\r\nseries of years, of a species of grass called AEgilops. This is\r\nindigenous on the shores of the Mediterranean, in those countries which,\r\nfrom time immemorial, have been the sources of our wheat. No one has\r\never found wild wheat in any country; it would be as strange as a wild\r\ncabbage or turnip. But the practical question is, How can wheat be most\r\nsurely and profitably grown? The first requisite is a suitable soil. A\r\nclay or limestone soil is usually considered best, as there is much lime\r\nin wheat-bran. Such soil is better than light sand, or some of the\r\npoorer loams. But the large yields of wheat on the Western prairies, and\r\non the rich alluvial soils of California river-bottoms, shows that the\r\nbest of wheat may grow on other than clay lands. The truth of the matter\r\nrespecting soils for wheat, is, that any soil good for corn, potatoes,\r\nor a garden, may, with proper tillage, produce the best of wheat.\r\nExperience in England, and in all the old countries on the continent of\r\nEurope, shows us that old land may be made to yield as large crops of\r\nwheat as the virgin soil of the New World. The production of wheat at\r\nsuitable intervals, for a century, on the same land, need not lessen its\r\npower to produce good wheat in large quantities. Wheat is a plant\r\ndemanding a rich soil, worked deep, and not too wet: these three things\r\nwill produce a good crop on any land. We say to all farmers, raise wheat\r\non any land that you can afford to prepare. First, if your land has not\r\na dry subsoil, underdrain it thoroughly: water standing in the soil, and\r\nbecoming cold or stagnant, is very injurious to wheat. Drainage is\r\nhardly more essential to any other crop than this. Next, plow deep.\r\nSubsoiling, on most lands, is very important to wheat. Manure highly,\r\nand put the manure between the soil and the subsoil: this attracts the\r\nroots deep into the soil, which is the greatest protection against\r\nwinter-killing, and the effects of excessive drought. Render the surface\r\nof the soil as fine as possible. A finely-pulverized soil is as\r\nessential for wheat as for onions. Coarse lumpy soils are so open to the\r\naction of the atmosphere as to render the growth unequal, and cause the\r\nroots of the plant to grow too near the surface, for dry weather or the\r\ncold of winter. Always apply lime to wheat-lands, unless it be a\r\nlimestone soil--not too much at once, but a few bushels to the acre\r\nannually. On no other crop do wood-ashes and dissolved potash, applied\r\nin the coarse manures, pay so well as on wheat. Sowing the seed is next\r\nin importance. The three questions in sowing are the manner, the depth,\r\nand the quantity. Shall it be drilled or sowed broadcast? Broadcast\r\nsowing requires more seed, and is liable to be less evenly covered;\r\nhence, we should prefer drilling. The depth of the seed is to be\r\ndetermined by the texture of the soil. Careful experiments have shown,\r\nthat on clay land there is no perceptible difference in the growth of\r\nthe plants, at any of the stages, in seed sown at any depth, from a\r\nslight covering to three or four inches. At a greater depth, it comes up\r\nless regularly, and in every way is in a worse condition. But on a light\r\nsoil, it is, no doubt, best to plant it from four to six inches deep. On\r\nvery loose soils, as muck land and alluvial soils, the roots of the\r\nplants grow too near the surface, and are exposed to being thrown out by\r\nwinter frosts, and destroyed. The remedy is deep sowing and thorough\r\nrolling. The quantity of seed now more generally sown is from five pecks\r\nto two bushels per acre. Rich land will not bear so much seed as the\r\npoorer. It will grow so thick as to render the straw tender, and expose\r\nit to lodge and ruin the crop. Wheat tillers, or thickens up at the\r\nbottom, making many stalks from a single seed, quite as much as any\r\nother grain; hence, we believe that if it be sown at a proper time on\r\nvery rich land, three pecks to the acre would be better than more. Such\r\nsowing would make more vigorous plants, with much stronger roots, which\r\nwould withstand cold and unfavorable weather better than any other. We\r\nshould still more strongly recommend another form of sowing, practised\r\nby some European cultivators with great success: it is, to drill in\r\nwheat, in rows two feet apart, and give it a spring cultivation; this\r\ngives great strength to the plants, destroys the weeds, promotes rapid\r\ngrowth by stirring the soil, and favors tillering, so that the rows will\r\nmeet, and give a great growth. We doubt not this will yet be extensively\r\nadopted in this country. All wheat-land had better be rolled after\r\nsowing, and light lands, with a very heavy roller. Light sandy land,\r\nhaving a little clay mixed in as recommended under soils, well manured,\r\nthe seed planted six inches deep, and the whole rolled with a heavy\r\nroller, will bear great crops of wheat.\r\n\r\nAs it respects fall or spring wheat, no positive directions can be\r\ngiven, adapted to all climates. In many localities it is of little use\r\nto sow winter wheat, as it is very uncertain. In other localities winter\r\nwheat almost always succeeds best. This question then must be determined\r\nby circumstances. The time of sowing winter wheat varies in different\r\nclimates, according as it may be exposed to depredations of worms and\r\ninsects in the fall. Farmers are not liable to mistake in this matter.\r\nSpring wheat, in all climates, should be sowed very early. It is hardly\r\npossible in all the Middle and Northern states to prepare the ground in\r\nspring, and get in wheat in suitable season.\r\n\r\nThe yield of a crop of spring wheat, depends materially upon the growth\r\nin the cool and moist weather of spring, when it spreads and its roots\r\nget a strong hold before the hot weather, that hurries up the stalks\r\nand ears to maturity. Hence plow in the fall, and harrow in the wheat,\r\nas early as possible, in the spring.\r\n\r\n_The varieties_ of wheat are numerous and uncertain. In the state of\r\nMaine, an intelligent cultivator, in 1856, recommended Java wheat as\r\nhaving a very stiff straw, and producing a very heavy yield. The\r\nMediterranean wheat is also a favorite variety. Club wheat has also had\r\na great run, and is now very popular at the West. But of varieties no\r\none can be confident. We notice in the discussions of the best\r\nagriculturists of England and Scotland, that they have doubts of the\r\nproper names of some of the best varieties. In a certain rich part of\r\nIllinois we know an unusually popular wheat, sold at high prices for\r\nseed, under the name of _mud club_, as being much better than the\r\nordinary club. We happened to learn that it was nothing but common club\r\nwheat, sown on rather low ground, where it happened to grow very fair\r\nthat season. It is only occasionally that such tricks are successfully\r\nplayed, but it is true that many varieties are the result of extra good\r\nor chance cultivation. The celebrated Chidham wheat, named from a place\r\nwhere it was successfully grown, was also called Hedge wheat, because a\r\nhead found growing in a hedge was supposed to be the origin of it. Now\r\nit is not probable that that head was the only one of the kind in all\r\nthe country, and it would by no means be identified in all localities.\r\nAnd as all wheat is the result of the cultivation of the AEgilops or some\r\nother wild grass, it shows us that varieties may be produced by\r\ncultivation. Great importance is therefore to be attached to frequently\r\nchanging seed; especially bringing it from colder into warmer climates,\r\nand changing from one soil to a very different one. Thus seed raised on\r\nhard hills is highly valuable for alluvial soils. Thus the efforts to\r\nintroduce so many new varieties from the dominions of the sultan, will\r\nprove of vast advantage to wheat culture in America. So let us be\r\nconstantly importing the best from Great Britain and the British\r\nprovinces and from California, and all the extremes of our own country.\r\nSuch wheats are worth more for seeds than others, but any extravagant\r\nprices for seed wheat, under the idea of almost miraculous powers of\r\nproduction, are unwise.\r\n\r\nIt would be useless to go into a more extended notice of varieties, as\r\nsome do best in certain localities, and all are rapidly spread through\r\nthe dealers, and by the influence of agricultural periodicals. The best\r\ntime to harvest wheat is when the straw below the head has turned\r\nyellow, and the grain is so far out of the milk as not to be easily\r\nmashed between the fingers, but before it has become hard. The grain is\r\nheavier and of better quality, and wastes far less in harvesting, than\r\nwhen allowed to ripen and dry standing in the field. Drying in good\r\nshocks is far better than drying before cut. Some have gone to extremes\r\nin early cutting, and harvested their wheat while in the milk, and\r\nsuffered serious loss in its weight. We sometimes have rain in harvest,\r\nwhich causes all the wheat in a large region to grow before getting it\r\ndry enough to house. A remedy is, to go right on and cut your wheat,\r\nrain or shine, and put it up, without binding, in large cocks of from\r\nthree to five bushels, packing together as close as possible, however\r\nwet, and cover the centre with a bundle of wheat to shed rain. It will\r\ndry out without growing; and, although the straw will be somewhat\r\nmouldy, the grain will be perfectly good, even when it has been so wet\r\nas to make the top of the shocks perfectly green with grown wheat. This\r\nprocess is of great value in a wet season. To prepare seed-wheat for\r\nsowing, soak it for a day or two in very strong brine; skim off all that\r\nrises; remove the grain from the brine, and while wet, sift on\r\nfresh-slaked lime until it slightly coats the whole grain; put on a\r\nlittle plaster to render the sowing more pleasant to the hand. Wheat\r\nwill lie in this condition for days without injury. So prepared, it will\r\nexhibit a marked superiority in the growing crop.\r\n\r\n_Enemies_ of wheat are numerous, and various remedies are proposed. The\r\nwire-worm is sometimes very destructive. Wheat planted with a drill,\r\nwith a heavy cast-iron roller behind each tooth, will not suffer by\r\nthem; they will only work in the mellow ground between the drills. Drive\r\nover a field of wheat exposed to injury from wire-worms with a common\r\nox-cart, and you will notice a marked difference; wherever the\r\ncartwheel passed over, the wheat remains unharmed by the wire-worm,\r\nwhile on either side much of it will be destroyed. But the wheat-midge,\r\nor weevil, is the great enemy, rendering the cultivation of wheat in\r\nsome localities useless. One precaution is, to get the wheat forward so\r\nearly and fast as to have it out of the way before they destroy it. This\r\nis often done by early sowing, high fertilization, and warm land.\r\nSometimes wheat is too late for them, and then a good crop is secured.\r\nBut this can only be relied on in cool, moist climates. Our hot, dry\r\nseasons are not suitable for wheat, late enough to be out of the way of\r\nthe weevil. The great remedy for this enemy is his destruction. Burning\r\nthe chaff at thrashing is useless for this purpose. The worm has\r\nentered the ground to remain for the winter, before the wheat is\r\nharvested. We know of but one way to kill the weevil, and that is, by\r\ninsect lamps or torches in the field in the evening. The flies are\r\ninactive until evening, when, from dusk till eight or nine o'clock, they\r\ndeposite their eggs in the blossoms and chaff of the wheat. Now, it is\r\nascertained that this fly, like many other insects, will fly several\r\nrods to a light. Twenty-five torches at equal distances, in a ten-acre\r\nlot of wheat, would be near enough. Nearly all the flies in a field\r\nwould fly to them in half an hour. These need be lighted only on\r\npleasant evenings, as weevils will not work in wind or rain, and they\r\nonly commit their depredations during the time the wheat is in blossom.\r\nLet twenty-five racks, or holders of some kind, be put up on ten acres\r\nof wheat, and have pitch-pine put in them and ignited, after the manner\r\nof night fishermen, and let this be done a few nights, during the\r\nblossoming season of wheat, and the fly will be destroyed and the crop\r\nsaved, in the worst weevil-season that ever occurred. In the absence of\r\npitch-pine, some other light can be devised--as, balls of rags dipped in\r\nturpentine and sulphur, as in a torchlight procession. Something can be\r\ndevised that will burn brilliantly for an hour: this will not cost fifty\r\ncents an acre, during the weevil-season, and will prove almost a perfect\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\nRust in wheat is only avoided by getting your wheat to maturity before\r\nthe rust strikes it. If it is nearly mature, and the rust strikes it,\r\ncut it and shock it up in the shortest time possible.\r\n\r\nWheat is a great subject in agriculture, on which many volumes have been\r\nwritten, and on which it is customary to write long articles. We trust\r\nthe recapitulation of what we have said, in the following brief rules,\r\nis more valuable to the practical wheat-culturist than any large volume\r\ncould be. Analyses of wheat-bran and straw, the philosophy of rust in\r\nwheat, the length, size, and color of the weevil, and the great\r\ndiversity of opinions on wheat-growing, are not what practical men\r\nregard. The one question is, How can I grow wheat surely and profitably?\r\nThe following rules answer this important question, rendering failure\r\nunnecessary:--\r\n\r\n1. Make your soil very rich, putting the manure as deep as convenient.\r\nApply lime, wood-ashes, and potash, the latter dissolved and applied to\r\nyour coarse manure.\r\n\r\n2. Under-drain thoroughly all wheat-land, except that on a dry subsoil.\r\n\r\n3. Plow deep and subsoil all wheat-lands, except those on a gravelly or\r\nsandy bottom.\r\n\r\n4. Plant wheat from two to six inches deep, according to the texture of\r\nthe soil--deepest on the lightest soil. Roll after sowing, and roll\r\nlight lands with a heavy roller.\r\n\r\n5. Always get your wheat in early, and in a finely-pulverized soil, and\r\nbe careful not to seed too heavy.\r\n\r\n6. Sow seed that has not long been grown in your vicinity, and steep it\r\ntwo days, before sowing, in a brine, with as much salt as the water will\r\ndissolve, sifting fine, fresh lime over the wet grain, after removing it\r\nfrom the brine; put on, also, plaster-of-Paris or wood-ashes.\r\n\r\n7. Harvest wheat before the straw becomes dry, or the grain hard.\r\n\r\n8. Destroy weevil by lights in the field, on the pleasant evenings\r\nduring the blossoming season.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHORTLEBERRY.\r\n\r\nOf this excellent berry there are several varieties, distinguished by\r\nthe height of the bushes, or by the color of the fruit. The main\r\ndivisions are, the _Swamp_ and the _Plain Whortleberries_. The swamp\r\nvariety has been transferred to gardens, in Michigan, and has proved\r\nvaluable. The shrub attains considerable size, producing fruit more\r\nsurely and regularly than in its wild state, and of an improved quality\r\nand larger size. It may be grown as well as currants all over the\r\ncountry. The small plain variety is usually found on sandy plains, and\r\nis a great bearer of fruit everywhere highly prized. It may be\r\ntransferred to all our gardens, by making a bed of sand six inches or a\r\nfoot deep, or it may be so acclimated as to grow well in any good garden\r\nsoil, and become a universal luxury. We recommend it as a standing fruit\r\nfor all gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLOW.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of willow for osier-work is pursued to some extent in\r\nthis country, and might be greatly increased. At one fourth the present\r\nprices, it would pay as well as any other branch of agriculture. Some\r\nvarieties will grow on land of little value for other purposes, and all\r\non any good land. Willows will take care of themselves after the second\r\nor third year. The more usual method of planting is of slips, ten inches\r\nlong, set in mellow ground about eight inches deep, in straight rows\r\nfour or six feet apart, and one foot apart in the rows--except the green\r\nwillow, which is put two feet apart in the row. They should be kept\r\nclear of weeds for the first two years. The osiers are to be cut when\r\nthe bark will peel somewhat easily, and may be put through a machine for\r\nthe purpose, invented by J. Colby, of Jonesville, Vermont, at the rate\r\nof two tons per day, removing all the bark, without injuring the wood.\r\nDifferent opinions prevail respecting the varieties most profitable for\r\ncultivation; they vary in different localities. The manufacture of\r\nwillow-ware will increase with the increased production of osiers, and\r\nthe consequent reduction of their cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINE.\r\n\r\nWe have elsewhere stated that our only hope for pure wine in this\r\ncountry is in domestic manufacture. We shall here give two recipes that\r\nwill insure better articles than are now offered under the name of\r\nimported wines.\r\n\r\n_Currant Wine._--This, as usually manufactured, is a mere cordial,\r\nrather than a wine. The following recipe gathered from the _Working\r\nFarmer_, is all that need be desired, on making wine from currants,\r\ncherries, and most berries, that are not too sweet. Take clean ripe\r\ncurrants and pass them between two rollers, or in some other way, crush\r\nthem, put them in a strong bag, and under a screw or weight, and the\r\njuice will be easily expressed. To each quart of this juice, add three\r\npounds of _double-refined_ loaf sugar (no other sugar will do) and water\r\nenough to make a gallon. Or in a cask that will hold thirty gallons, put\r\nthirty quarts of the juice, ninety pounds of the sugar, and fill to the\r\nbung with water. Put in the bung and roll the cask until you can not\r\nhear the sugar moving on the inside of the barrel, when it will all be\r\ndissolved. Next day roll it again, and place it in a cellar of very even\r\ntemperature, and leave the bung out to allow fermentation. This will\r\ncommence in two or three days and continue for a few weeks. Its presence\r\nmay be known by a slight noise like that of soda water, which may be\r\nheard by placing the ear at the bung hole. When this ceases drive the\r\nbung tight and let it stand six months, when the wine may be drawn off\r\nand bottled, and will be perfectly clear and not too sweet. No alcohol\r\nshould be added. Putting in brandies or other spirituous liquors\r\nprevents the fermentation of wine, leaving the mixture a mere cordial.\r\nThe use of any but double-refined sugar is always injurious, and yet\r\nmany will persist in using it, because it is cheaper. The reason for\r\ndiscarding, for wine-making, all but double-refined sugar, may be easily\r\nunderstood. Common sugar contains one half of one per cent. of gum, that\r\nbecomes fetid on being dissolved in water. The quantity of this gum in\r\nthe sugar, for a barrel of wine, is considerable--enough to give a bad\r\nflavor to the wine. This is avoided by using double-refined sugar, which\r\ncontains no gum. This recipe is equally good for cherry wine.\r\n\r\nThe following recipe for making _Elderberry Wine_, produces an article\r\nthat the best judges in New York and elsewhere have pronounced equal to\r\nany imported wine. Its excellence has made quite a market for\r\nelderberries in New York. These berries are so easily grown, and the\r\nwine so excellent, that their growth will be encouraged throughout the\r\ncountry. It is not only an exceedingly palatable wine, but is better\r\nfor the sick, than any other known.\r\n\r\nTo every quart of the berries, put a quart of water and boil for half an\r\nhour. Bruise them from the skin and strain, and to every gallon of the\r\njuice add three pounds of _double-refined_ sugar and one quarter of an\r\nounce of cream of tartar and boil for half an hour. Take a clean cask\r\nand put in it one pound of raisins to every three gallons of the wine,\r\nand a slice of toasted bread covered over with good yeast. When the wine\r\nhas become quite cool, put it into the cask, and place it in a room of\r\neven temperature to ferment. When the fermentation has fully ceased, put\r\nthe bung in tight. No brandy or alcohol of any kind will be necessary.\r\nAny one following this recipe _exactly_, will be surprised at the\r\nexcellence of the wine that will be the result.\r\n\r\nOf _Grape Wines_, there are several varieties, whose peculiarities are\r\ndetermined mainly by the process of manufacturing. A full treatment of\r\nthe subject would require a volume. The following brief directions will\r\ninsure success in making the most desirable grape wines:\r\n\r\n1. Let the grapes become thoroughly ripe before gathering, to increase\r\ntheir saccharine qualities and make a stronger wine. All fruits make\r\nmuch better wine for being fully ripe. Cut the bunches with a sharp\r\nknife and move carefully to avoid bruising. Spread them in a dry shade\r\nto evaporate excessive moisture.\r\n\r\n2. Assort the grapes before using, removing all decayed, green, or\r\nbroken ones, using only perfect berries.\r\n\r\n3. Mash the grapes with a beater in a tub, or by passing them through a\r\ncider-mill. \"_Treading the wine vat_\" was the ancient method of mashing\r\nthe grapes, not now practised except in some parts of Europe.\r\n\r\n4. To make light wines put them at once into press, as apple pomace in a\r\ncider-press.\r\n\r\n5. To make higher-colored wines let the pomace stand from four to\r\ntwenty-four hours before pressing. They will be dark in proportion to\r\nthe length of time the pomace stands.\r\n\r\n6. To make wines resembling the Austere wines of France and Spain, let\r\nthe pomace stand until the first fermentation is over, called\r\n\"fermenting in the skin.\"\r\n\r\n7. The \"must\" or grape-juice is to be put into casks, the larger the\r\nbetter, but only one pressing should be put into one cask. Put in a\r\ncellar of even temperature, not lower than fifty nor higher than\r\nsixty-five degrees of Fahrenheit, and where there is plenty of air.\r\n\r\nPrepare the cask by burning in it a strip of paper or muslin, dipped in\r\nmelted sulphur, and suspended by a wire across the bung-hole.\r\nFermentation commences very soon and will be completed within a few days\r\nor weeks according to the temperature. Its completion is marked by the\r\ncessation of the escape of gas. No sugar, brandy, or any other\r\nsubstance, should be added to the grape-juice to make good wine. They\r\nare all adulterations. The wine having settled after this fermentation,\r\nmay be racked off into clean casks, prepared as before. A second\r\nfermentation will take place in the spring. It should not be bottled\r\nuntil after this second fermentation, as its expansion will break the\r\nglass. While in the casks they should always be kept full, being\r\noccasionally filled from a small cask, kept for the purpose. When this\r\nfermentation ceases, bottle and cork tight, and lay the bottles on their\r\nsides, in a cool cellar. The wine will improve with age.\r\n\r\nSometimes it remains on the lees without racking and is drawn off and\r\nbottled. Frequently the wine does not become wholly clear and needs\r\nfining. Various substances are used for this purpose, as fish-glue,\r\ncharcoal, starch, rice, milk, &c. The best of these substances is\r\ncharcoal, or the white of eggs and milk. Add by degrees according to the\r\nfoulness of the wine. An ounce of charcoal to a barrel of wine is an\r\nordinary quantity; or a pint of milk with the white of four eggs--more\r\nor less according to the state of the wine.\r\n\r\n_Rhine Wine_ of Germany may be made as follows:--\r\n\r\nTake good Catawba or Isabella grapes, and pound or grind them so as to\r\ncrush every seed and leave them in that state for twenty-four hours.\r\nFumigate the cask by burning strips of muslin dipped in sulphur as in\r\nthe preceding recipe. Strain or press out the juice into the cask\r\nfilling it and keeping it _entirely full_, that impurities may run out\r\nof the bung, during fermentation. In the spring prepare another cask in\r\nthe same way and rack it off into that. When a year old bottle it and it\r\nis fit for use.\r\n\r\nSweeter wines than any of the above are made by adding sugar to the must\r\nbefore fermentation. It should be _double-refined_ sugar, and still it\r\nis an adulteration.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODLANDS.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest errors of American farmers is their neglect to\r\ncultivate groves of trees for woodlands, in all suitable places. Our\r\nprimeval forests have been wantonly destroyed, and the country is not\r\nyet old enough to feel the full force of neglecting to replenish them,\r\nby new groves, in suitable localities. On the points of hills, rough\r\nstony places, sides of steep hills, ravines that can not be cultivated,\r\nand by the side of all the highways of the land, trees should be\r\ncultivated: in some places fruit-trees, but in most places forest-trees.\r\nThe advantages would be manifold; they would afford shade for cattle,\r\ngroves for birds, which would destroy the worms; they would break off\r\nthe cold winds from crops, cattle, fruit-orchards, and dwellings; would\r\ngreatly enrich the soil by their annual foliage, afford abundance of\r\nfuel at the cheapest rates, give much good timber, provide for fine\r\nmaple-sugar, and be the greatest ornaments of the rural districts. Only\r\nthink of the comfort and beauty of fifty miles square, in which not a\r\nstreet could be found which had not trees on each side, not more than\r\ntwelve feet apart. When such trees should become twenty years old, the\r\npedestrian or the carriage could move all day in the shade, listening to\r\nthe music of the birds, and inhaling the aroma of the foliage or\r\nflowers. To every owner or occupant of the soil we say, plant trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOULTRY.\r\n\r\nFattening and preparing poultry for the market are important items in\r\nrural economy. Plenty of sweet food and pure water given at regular\r\ntimes, and the fowls not allowed to wander, are the requisites of\r\nsuccessful fattening. The best feed for fattening fowls is oat-meal.\r\nNext to this is corn-meal. Three things are essential in food for\r\nfattening animals, flesh-forming, fat-forming, and heat-producing\r\nsubstances. Of all the grains ordinarily fed, oat-meal contains these in\r\nthe best proportions, and next to this comes yellow Indian corn meal.\r\nFat is good, but must be given in a hard form as in mutton or beef\r\nsuet. Rice boiled in sweet milk, fed for a day or two before killing\r\nfowls is said to render the flesh of a white delicate color.\r\n\r\nAt least one third of the value of poultry in the market depends upon\r\nproperly preparing and transporting it.\r\n\r\n1. Do not feed fowls at all for twenty-four hours before killing them.\r\n\r\n2. Kill by cutting the jugular vein with a sharp pen-knife, just under\r\nthe sides of the head, and hang them up to bleed.\r\n\r\n3. Pick carefully and very clean, without tearing the skin, and without\r\nscalding. Singe slightly if need be. Dip in hot water for three or four\r\nseconds and in cold water half a minute.\r\n\r\n4. Do not open the breast at all, but remove the entrails from the hind\r\nopening, leaving the gizzard in its place. Put no water in but wipe out\r\nthe blood with a dry cloth. Leaving the entrails in is injurious,\r\ntending to sour the meat and taint it with their flavor.\r\n\r\n5. Do not allow your poultry to freeze by any means. For transporting to\r\na distant market, pack in shallow boxes never containing over three\r\nhundred pounds each and in clean straw without chaff or dust, and in\r\nsuch a manner that no two fowls will touch each other.\r\n\r\n6. Geese and ducks look better with the heads cut off. But all fowls\r\nhaving their heads removed must have the skin drawn down and tightly\r\ntied over the end of the neck bone. This will preserve them well and\r\ngive a good appearance.\r\n\r\nTo preserve fowls for a long time in a perfectly sweet condition for\r\nfamily use, fill them half full or more with pulverized charcoal, which\r\nwill act as an absorbent and prevent every particle of taint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PERIODICALS.\r\n\r\nThe following list of Agricultural Periodicals embraces all that have\r\ncome to our knowledge. In a subsequent edition we shall endeavor to\r\nrender the list more complete, and give the special design of each, with\r\nthe frequency of publication, form, price, editor's and publisher's\r\nnames, etc.\r\n\r\nNAME OF PAPER.
