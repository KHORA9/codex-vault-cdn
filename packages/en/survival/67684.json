MARTIN’s LANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PREFACE BY THE PUBLISHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat pains have been taken with the present translation, as well in\r\nregard to fidelity and style, as in what may be termed the accessories.\r\nIn addition to all that is contained in the original work, it comprises\r\nan interesting view of Chimborazo, from a sketch by Humboldt himself; a\r\nfac-simile of the author’s handwriting; head-lines of contents;\r\ntranslations of the principal Latin, French, and Spanish quotations;[A]\r\na very complete index; and a conversion of all the foreign measurements.\r\nIt was at first intended to give both the foreign and English\r\nmeasurements, in juxta-position; but this plan was abandoned on\r\nperceiving that the pages would become overloaded with figures, and\r\npresent a perplexing and somewhat appalling aspect, without affording\r\nany equivalent advantage to the English reader. In some few instances,\r\nhowever, where it seemed desirable, and in all the parallel tables,\r\nduplicate measurements have been inserted. The French _toises_ are\r\nconverted into their relative number of English feet; and German miles,\r\nwhether simple or square, are reduced to our own. The longitudes have\r\nbeen calculated from Greenwich, conformably to English maps, in lieu of\r\nthose given by Humboldt, which are calculated from Paris. The degrees of\r\ntemperature, instead of Reaumur’s, are Fahrenheit’s, as now the most\r\ngenerally recognised.\r\n\r\nIt here becomes necessary to say something of the translators, and the\r\ncause of so much unexpected delay in producing this volume; the more so\r\nas many of the subscribers to the Scientific Library have expressed an\r\ninterest in the subject, owing, in some measure, to a controversy which\r\narose out of my previous publication of _Cosmos_. The translation was\r\noriginally entrusted to E. C. Otté, with an agreement as to time,\r\naccording to which I had every reason to expect that I should fulfil my\r\nengagement to publish it in October last, or at latest in November; but,\r\nafter much of the manuscript was prepared, the translator’s\r\nindisposition and subsequent absence from London, occasioned a serious\r\nsuspension. In this dilemma I found it necessary to call in aid, as well\r\nas to assist personally. The result of this “co-operation of forces”\r\nwill no doubt prove satisfactory to the reader, inasmuch as every sheet\r\nhas been at least trebly revised, and it is hoped proportionably\r\nimproved. In addition to the responsible translator, my principal\r\ncollaborateur has been Mr. E. H. Whitelocke, a gentleman well qualified\r\nfor the task.\r\n\r\nAll the measurements are calculated by the scientific friend, who\r\nfulfilled this department so satisfactorily in my edition of _Cosmos_.\r\n\r\nThe translation of the pretty poem, _The Parrot of Atures_, (page 189,)\r\nnow first given in English, is contributed by Mr. Edgar A. Bowring.\r\n\r\nFor the additional notes subscribed “ED.” I am myself, in most\r\ninstances, responsible.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said, pro and con, about the sanction of the Author to the\r\nseveral translations of his works. My answer has, I believe, been\r\ngenerally considered satisfactory and conclusive. I have now only to\r\nadd, that when I wrote to Baron Humboldt, more than a year and a-half\r\nago, presenting him with my then unpublished edition of _Cosmos_, I\r\nannounced my intention of proceeding with his other works, and consulted\r\nhim on the subject. He replied in the kindest spirit, without intimating\r\nany previous engagement, and honoured me with several valuable\r\nsuggestions. A portion of one of his letters is annexed in fac-simile.\r\nIn consequence of what I then presumed to be his recommendation, I\r\ndetermined to make the _Ansichten_ my next volume, and announced it,\r\nlong before any one else, though not at first by its English name. At\r\nthat time I had reason to hope that I should receive the new German\r\nedition at least as early as any one, but was disappointed. This\r\ncircumstance, added to the delay already alluded to, has brought me late\r\ninto the field. In now, however, presenting my subscribers with what I\r\nhave taken every available means to render a perfect book, I hope I\r\nshall afford them ample atonement.\r\n\r\nA few words respecting the work itself. The first edition was published\r\nforty-three years ago, the second in 1826, and the third, of which the\r\npresent volume is a translation, in August last. The difference between\r\nthe three editions in respect to the text (if I may so distinguish the\r\nmore entertaining part of the work from the scientific “Illustrations”)\r\nis not material, excepting that each has one or more new chapters. Thus\r\nto the second edition was added the _Essay on Volcanos_ and the curious\r\nallegory on vital force, entitled _The Rhodian Genius_, and to the third\r\n_The Plateau of Caxamarca_.\r\n\r\nThe additions to the “Illustrations” however in the third edition are\r\nconsiderable, and comprise a rapid sketch of whatever has been\r\ncontributed by modern science in illustration of the Author’s favourite\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nNo intellectual reader can peruse this masterly work without intense\r\ninterest and considerable instruction. After feasting on the highly\r\nwrought and, it may be said, poetical descriptions, written in the\r\nAuthor’s earlier years, he will turn with increased zest to the\r\nelaborate illustrations, which, in a separate form, are brought to bear\r\non every subject of the text. This scientific portion, although not at\r\nfirst the most attractive, presents many delightful episodes, which will\r\namply repay the perusal of even those who merely read for amusement.\r\n\r\n                                                          HENRY G. BOHN.\r\n\r\n _York Street, January, 1850._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AUTHOR’S PREFACE,\r\n                         TO THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith some diffidence, I here present to the public a series of papers\r\nwhich originated in the presence of the noblest objects of nature,—on\r\nthe Ocean,—in the forests of the Orinoco,—in the Savannahs of\r\nVenezuela,—and in the solitudes of the Peruvian and Mexican Mountains.\r\nSeveral detached fragments, written on the spot, have since been wrought\r\ninto a whole. A survey of nature at large,—proofs of the co-operation of\r\nforces,—and a renewal of the enjoyment which the immediate aspect of the\r\ntropical countries affords to the susceptible beholder,—are the objects\r\nat which I aim. Each Essay was designed to be complete in itself; and\r\none and the same tendency pervades the whole. This æsthetic mode of\r\ntreating subjects of Natural History is fraught with great difficulties\r\nin the execution, notwithstanding the marvellous vigour and flexibility\r\nof my native language. The wonderful luxuriance of nature presents an\r\naccumulation of separate images, and accumulation disturbs the harmony\r\nand effect of a picture. When the feelings and the imagination are\r\nexcited, the style is apt to stray into poetical prose. But these ideas\r\nrequire no amplification here, for the following pages afford but too\r\nabundant examples of such deviations and of such want of unity.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these defects, which I can more easily perceive than\r\namend, let me hope that these “Views” may afford the reader, at least\r\nsome portion of that enjoyment which a sensitive mind receives from the\r\nimmediate contemplation of nature. As this enjoyment is heightened by an\r\ninsight into the connection of the occult forces, I have subjoined to\r\neach treatise scientific illustrations and additions.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the reader’s attention is directed to the perpetual influence\r\nwhich physical nature exercises on the moral condition and on the\r\ndestiny of man. It is to minds oppressed with care that these pages are\r\nespecially consecrated. He who has escaped from the stormy waves of life\r\nwill joyfully follow me into the depths of the forests, over the\r\nboundless steppes and prairies, and to the lofty summits of the Andes.\r\nTo him are addressed the words of the chorus who preside over the\r\ndestinies of mankind:\r\n\r\n            On the mountains is freedom! the breath of decay\r\n              Never sullies the fresh flowing air;\r\n            Oh! nature is perfect wherever we stray;\r\n              ’Tis man that deforms it with care.[B]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AUTHOR’S PREFACE,\r\n                   TO THE SECOND AND THIRD EDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe twofold object of this work,—an anxious endeavour to heighten the\r\nenjoyment of nature by vivid representations, and at the same time to\r\nincrease, according to the present state of science, the reader’s\r\ninsight into the harmonious co-operation of forces,—was pointed out by\r\nme in the preface to the first edition, nearly half a century ago. I\r\nthere alluded to the several obstacles which oppose themselves to the\r\næsthetic treatment of the grand scenes of nature. The combination of a\r\nliterary and a purely scientific aim, the desire to engage the\r\nimagination, and at the same time to enrich life with new ideas by the\r\nincrease of knowledge, render the due arrangement of the separate parts,\r\nand what is required as unity of composition, difficult of attainment.\r\nNotwithstanding these disadvantages, however, the public have continued\r\nto receive with indulgent partiality, my imperfect performance.\r\n\r\nThe second edition of the _Views of Nature_, was published by me in\r\nParis in 1826. Two papers were then added, one, “An inquiry into the\r\nstructure and mode of action of Volcanos in different regions of the\r\nearth;” the other, “Vital Force, or The Rhodian Genius.” Schiller, in\r\nremembrance of his youthful medical studies, loved to converse with me,\r\nduring my long stay at Jena, on physiological subjects. The inquiries in\r\nwhich I was then engaged, in preparing my work “On the condition of the\r\nfibres of muscles and nerves, when irritated by contact with substances\r\nchemically opposed,” often imparted a more serious direction to our\r\nconversation. It was at this period that I wrote the little allegory on\r\nVital Force, called The Rhodian Genius. The predilection which Schiller\r\nentertained for this piece, and which he admitted into his periodical,\r\n_Die Horen_, gave me courage to introduce it here. My brother, in a\r\nletter which has recently been published (William von Humboldt’s Letters\r\nto a Female Friend, vol. ii. p. 39), delicately alludes to the subject,\r\nbut at the same time very justly adds; “The development of a\r\nphysiological idea is exclusively the object of the essay. Such\r\nsemi-poetical clothings of grave truths were more in vogue at the time\r\nthis was written than they are at present.”\r\n\r\nIn my eightieth year I have still the gratification of completing a\r\nthird edition of my work, and entirely remoulding it to meet the demands\r\nof the age. Almost all the scientific illustrations are either enlarged\r\nor replaced by new and more comprehensive ones.\r\n\r\nI have indulged a hope of stimulating the study of nature, by\r\ncompressing into the smallest possible compass, the numerous results of\r\ncareful investigation on a variety of interesting subjects, with a view\r\nof shewing the importance of accurate numerical data, and the necessity\r\nof comparing them with each other, as well as to check the dogmatic\r\nsmattering and fashionable scepticism which have too long prevailed in\r\nthe so-called higher circles of society.\r\n\r\nMy expedition into northern Asia (to the Ural, the Altai, and the shores\r\nof the Caspian Sea) in the year 1829, with Ehrenberg and Gustavus Rose,\r\nat the command of the Emperor of Russia, took place between the second\r\nand third editions of my work. This expedition has essentially\r\ncontributed to the enlargement of my views in all that concerns the\r\nformation of the earth’s surface, the direction of mountain-chains, the\r\nconnexion of the Steppes and Deserts, and the geographical distribution\r\nof plants according to ascertained influences of temperature. The\r\nignorance which has so long existed respecting the two great\r\nsnow-covered mountain-chains, the Thian-schan and the Kuen-lün, situated\r\nbetween the Altai and Himalaya, has (owing to the injudicious neglect of\r\nChinese sources of information) obscured the geography of Central Asia,\r\nand propagated fancies instead of facts, in works of extensive\r\ncirculation. Within the last few months the hypsometric comparisons of\r\nthe culminating points of both continents have unexpectedly received\r\nimportant and corrective illustration, of which I am the first to avail\r\nmyself in the following pages. The measurement (now divested of former\r\nerrors) of the altitude of the two mountains, Sorata and Illimani, in\r\nthe eastern chain of the Andes of Bolivia, has not yet, with certainty,\r\nrestored the Chimborazo to its ancient pre-eminence among the snowy\r\nmountains of the new world. In the Himalaya the recent barometric\r\nmeasurement of the Kinchinjinga (26,438 Parisian, or 28,178 English\r\nfeet) places it next in height to the Dhawalagiri, which has also been\r\ntrigonometrically measured with greater accuracy.\r\n\r\nTo preserve uniformity with the two former editions of the _Views of\r\nNature_, the calculations of temperature, unless where the contrary is\r\nstated, are given according to the eighty degrees thermometer of Reamur.\r\nThe lineal measurement is the old French, in which the _toise_ is\r\nequivalent to six Parisian feet. The miles are geographical, fifteen to\r\na degree of the equator. The longitudes are calculated from the first\r\nmeridian of the Parisian Observatory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, March, 1849._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    Page\r\n PUBLISHER’S PREFACE                                                   v\r\n\r\n AUTHOR’S PREFACE, TO THE FIRST EDITION                               ix\r\n\r\n AUTHOR’S PREFACE, TO THE SECOND AND THIRD EDITIONS                   xi\r\n\r\n SUMMARY OF CONTENTS                                                xvii\r\n\r\n STEPPES AND DESERTS                                                   1\r\n Illustrations and Additions                                          22\r\n\r\n CATARACTS OF THE ORINOCO                                            153\r\n Illustrations and Additions                                         174\r\n\r\n NOCTURNAL LIFE OF ANIMALS IN THE PRIMEVAL FOREST                    191\r\n Illustrations and Additions                                         202\r\n Hypsometric Addenda                                                 204\r\n\r\n IDEAS FOR A PHYSIOGNOMY OF PLANTS                                   210\r\n Illustrations and Additions                                         232\r\n\r\n ON THE STRUCTURE AND MODE OF ACTION OF VOLCANOS IN DIFFERENT PARTS\r\n   OF THE EARTH                                                      353\r\n Illustrations and Additions                                         376\r\n\r\n VITAL FORCE, OR THE RHODIAN GENIUS                                  380\r\n Illustration and Note                                               386\r\n\r\n THE PLATEAU OF CAXAMARCA, the Ancient Capital of the Inca\r\n   Atahuallpa, and First View of the Pacific from the Ridge of the\r\n   Andes                                                             390\r\n Illustrations and Additions                                         421\r\n\r\n INDEX                                                               437\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  =FAC-SIMILE OF THE HAND-WRITING OF BARON HUMBOLDT.=\r\n\r\n  EXTRACTS OF A LETTER TO THE PUBLISHER.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SUMMARY OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n ON STEPPES AND DESERTS                                        pp. 1–21.\r\n\r\n  Coast-chain and mountain-valleys of Caracas.

Bolor, Khingan, and the\r\n  Chinese chains, which at the great bend of the Thibetan and\r\n  Assam-Burmese river, Dzangbo-tschu, stretch from north to south. The\r\n  meridian elevations alternate between the parallels of 66° and 77°\r\n  east long. from Cape Comorin to the Frozen Ocean, like displaced\r\n  veins. Thus the Ghauts, the Soliman chain, the Paralasa, the Bolor,\r\n  and the Ural follow from south to north. The Bolor gave rise, among\r\n  the ancients, to the idea respecting the Imaus, which Agathodæmon\r\n  considered to be prolonged northwards as far as the lowland or basin\r\n  of the lower Irtysch. Parallel chains, running east and west, the\r\n  Altai, Thian-schan with its active volcanos, which lie 1528 miles\r\n  from the frozen ocean at the mouth of the Obi, and 1512 from the\r\n  Indian Ocean at the mouth of the Ganges; Kuen-lün, already\r\n  recognized by Eratosthenes, Marinus of Tyre, Ptolemy, and Cosmas\r\n  Indicopleustes, as the greatest axis of elevation in the Old World,\r\n  between 35½° and 36° lat. in the direction of the diaphragm of\r\n  Dicæarchus. Himalaya. The Kuen-lün may be traced, when considered as\r\n  an axis of elevation, from the Chinese wall near Lung-tscheu,\r\n  through the somewhat more northerly chains of Nan-schan and\r\n  Kilian-schan, through the mountain node of the “Starry Sea,” the\r\n  Hindoo Cush (the Paropanisus and Indian Caucasus of the ancients),\r\n  and, lastly, through the chain of the Demavend and Persian Elburz,\r\n  as far as the Taurus in Lycia. Not far from the intersection of the\r\n  Kuen-lün by the Bolor, the corresponding direction of the axes of\r\n  elevation (inclining from east to west in the Kuen-lün and Hindoo\r\n  Cush, and on the other hand south-east and north-west in the\r\n  Himalaya) proves, that the Hindoo Cush is a prolongation of the\r\n  Kuen-lün, and not of the Himalaya which is associated to the latter\r\n  in the manner of a gang or vein. The point where the Himalaya\r\n  changes its direction, that is to say, where it leaves its former\r\n  east-westerly direction, lies not far from 81° east long. The\r\n  Djawahir is not, as has hitherto been supposed, the next in altitude\r\n  to the Dhawalagiri, which is the highest summit of the Himalaya;\r\n  for, according to Joseph Hooker, this rank is due to a mountain\r\n  lying in the meridian of Sikhim between Butan and Nepaul, called the\r\n  Kinchinjinga or Kintschin-Dschunga. This mountain (Kinchinjinga)\r\n  measured by Col. Waugh, Director of the Trigonometrical Survey of\r\n  India, has for its western summit an altitude of 28,178 feet, and\r\n  for its eastern 27,826 feet, according to the _Journal of the\r\n  Asiatic Soc. of Bengal_, November, 1848. The mountain, now\r\n  considered higher than the Dhawalagiri, is represented in the\r\n  engraving to the title-page of Joseph Hooker’s splendid work, _The\r\n  Rhododendrons of Sikkim Himalaya_, 1849.

The Huns, whose name was known even to\r\n  Dionysius Periegetes, and who are described by Ptolemy as Chuns (hence\r\n  the later territorial name of Chunigard!) are a Finnish tribe, from\r\n  the Ural mountains, which separate the two continents—pp. 80–81.\r\n\r\n  Representations of the sun, animals, and characters, graven on rocks\r\n  at Sierra Parime, as well as in North America, have frequently been\r\n  regarded as writing—p. 82.\r\n\r\n  Description of the cold mountain regions between 11,000 and 13,000\r\n  Parisian, or 11,720 and 13,850 English feet in height, which have been\r\n  designated Paramos.

Adanson\r\n  assigns to certain Baobab-stems of Senegambia an age of from 5000 to\r\n  6000 years—pp. 268–273.\r\n\r\n  According to an estimate based on the number of the annual rings,\r\n  there are yews (Taxus baccata) of from 2600 to 3000 years old. Whether\r\n  in the temperate northern zone that part of a tree which faces the\r\n  north has narrower rings, as Michael Montaigne asserted in 1581?\r\n  Gigantic trees, of which some individuals attain a diameter of above\r\n  20 feet and an age of several centuries, belong to the most opposite\r\n  natural families—pp. 273–274.\r\n\r\n  Diameter of the Mexican Schubertia disticha of Santa Maria del Tule\r\n  43, of the oak near Saintes (Dep. de la Charente inf.) 30 feet. The\r\n  age of this oak considered by its annual rings to be from 1800 to 2000\r\n  years. The main stem of the rose-tree (27 feet high) at the crypt of\r\n  the church of Hildesheim is 800 years old. A species of fucus,\r\n  Macrocystis pyrifera, attains a length of more than 350 feet, and\r\n  therefore exceeds all the conifera in length, not excepting the\r\n  Sequoia gigantea itself—pp. 274–276.\r\n\r\n  Investigations into the supposed number of the phanerogamic species of\r\n  plants, which have hitherto been described or are preserved in\r\n  herbariums. Numerical ratios of plant-forms. Discovered laws of the\r\n  geographical distribution of the families. Ratios of the great\r\n  divisions: of the Cryptogamia to the Cotyledons, and of the\r\n  Monocotyledons to the Dicotyledons, in the torrid, temperate, and\r\n  frigid zones. Outlines of arithmetical botany. Number of the\r\n  individuals, predominance of social plants. The forms of organic\r\n  beings stand in mutual dependence on each other. If once the number of\r\n  species in one of the great families of the Glumaceæ, Leguminosæ, or\r\n  Compositæ, on any one point of the earth, be known, an approximative\r\n  conclusion may be arrived at not only as to the number of all the\r\n  phanerogamia, but also of the species of all remaining plant-families\r\n  growing there. Connection of the numerical ratios here treated on in\r\n  the geographical distribution of the families, with the direction of\r\n  the isothermal lines. Primitive mystery in the distribution of types.\r\n  Absence of Roses in the southern, and of Calceolarias in the northern\r\n  zone. Why has our heath (Calluna vulgaris), and why have our Oaks not\r\n  progressed eastwards across the Ural into Asia? The vegetation-cycle\r\n  of each species requires a certain minimum heat for its due organic\r\n  development—pp. 273–287.\r\n\r\n  Analogy with the numeric laws in the distribution of animal forms. If\r\n  more than 35,000 species of phanerogamia are now cultivated in Europe,\r\n  and if from 160,000 to 212,000 phanerogamia are now contained,\r\n  described and undescribed, in our herbariums; it is probable that the\r\n  number of collected insects scarcely equals that number of\r\n  phanerogamia; whereas in individual European districts the insects\r\n  collected preponderate in a threefold ratio over the phanerogamia—pp.\r\n  287–291.\r\n\r\n  Considerations on the proportion borne by the number of the\r\n  phanerogamia actually ascertained, to the entire number existing on\r\n  the globe—pp. 291–295.\r\n\r\n  Influence of the pressure of atmospheric strata on the form and life\r\n  of plants, with reference to Alpine vegetation—pp. 295–296.\r\n\r\n  Specialities on the plant-forms already enumerated. Physiognomy of\r\n  plants discussed from three different points of view: the absolute\r\n  difference of the forms, their local preponderance in the sum total of\r\n  the phanerogamic Floras, and their geographical as well as climatic\r\n  dispersion—pp. 296–346. Greatest height of arboral plants; examples of\r\n  223 to 246 feet in Pinus Lambertiana and P. Douglasii, of 266 in P.\r\n  Strobus, of 300 feet in Sequoia gigantea and Pinus trigona. All these\r\n  examples are from the north-western part of the New Continent. The\r\n  Araucaria excelsa of Norfolk Island, accurately measured, rises only\r\n  from 182 to 223 feet; the Alpine palms of the Cordilleras (Ceroxylon\r\n  andicola), only 190 feet—pp. 322–324. A contrast to these gigantic\r\n  vegetable forms, presented not merely by the stem of the arctic willow\r\n  (Salix arctica, two inches in height,) stunted by cold and exposure on\r\n  the mountains, but also in the tropical plains by the Tristicha\r\n  hypnoides, a phanerogamic plant which is hardly three French lines\r\n  (quarter of an inch) in height, when fully developed—pp. 324–325.\r\n\r\n  Bursting forth of blossoms from the rough bark of the Crescentia\r\n  Cujete, of the Gustavia augusta, from the roots of the Cacao tree. The\r\n  largest blossoms borne by the Rafflesia Arnoldi, Aristolochia cordata,\r\n  Magnolia, Helianthus annuus—p. 348.\r\n\r\n  The different forms of plants determine the scenic character of\r\n  vegetation in the different zones. Physiognomic classification, or\r\n  distribution of the groups according to external facies, is from its\r\n  basis of arrangement entirely different from the classification\r\n  according to the system of natural families. The physiognomy of plants\r\n  is based principally on the so-called organs of vegetation, on which\r\n  the preservation of the individual depends; systematic botany bases\r\n  the classification of the natural families on the consideration of the\r\n  organs of reproduction, on which the preservation of the species\r\n  depends—pp. 348–352.\r\n\r\n ON THE STRUCTURE AND MODE OF ACTION OF VOLCANOS IN\r\n   DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EARTH—                            pp. 353–375.\r\n\r\n  Influence of travels in distant lands on the generalization of our\r\n  ideas and on the progress of physical orology. Influence of the\r\n  conformation of the Mediterranean on the earliest ideas respecting\r\n  volcanic phenomena.—COMPARATIVE GEOLOGY OF VOLCANOS. Periodical return\r\n  of certain revolutions in nature, the cause of which lies deep in the\r\n  interior of the globe. Proportion of the height of volcanos to that of\r\n  their cone of ashes in the Pichincha, Peak of Teneriffe, and Vesuvius.\r\n  Changes in the height of volcanic mountain summits. Measurements of\r\n  the margins of the crater of Vesuvius from 1773 to 1822; the author’s\r\n  measurements embrace the period from 1805 to 1822—pp. 353–365.\r\n  Circumstantial description of the eruption in the night between the\r\n  24th and 25th of October, 1822. Falling in of a cone of ashes more\r\n  than 400 feet high, which stood in the interior of the crater. The\r\n  eruption of ashes from the 24th to the 28th of October, was the most\r\n  memorable among those, of which authentic accounts are possessed,\r\n  since the time of the elder Pliny—pp. 365–371.\r\n\r\n  Difference between volcanos that are of very diverse forms, with\r\n  permanent craters, and the phenomena more rarely observed in historic\r\n  times, in which trachytic mountains suddenly open, eject lava and\r\n  ashes, and reclose, perhaps for ever. The latter phenomena are\r\n  peculiarly instructive for geognosy, because they remind us of the\r\n  earliest revolutions that occurred in the oscillating, upheaved,\r\n  fissured surface of the earth. In ancient times they led to the notion\r\n  of the Pyriphlegethon. Volcanos are intermittent earth-springs, the\r\n  result of a permanent or transitory connection between the interior\r\n  and exterior of our planet, the result of a reaction of the still\r\n  fluid interior against the crust of the earth; hence the question is\r\n  useless, as to what chemical substance burns in the volcanos, and\r\n  furnishes the material for combustion—pp. 371–373. The primary cause\r\n  of subterranean heat is, as in all planets, the formative process\r\n  itself, the separation of the conglomerating mass from a cosmic\r\n  vaporous fluid. Power and influence of the calorific radiation from\r\n  numerous deep fissures, unfilled veins in the primordial world. Great\r\n  independence, at that period, of the climate (atmospheric temperature)\r\n  in respect to geographical latitude, the position of the planet\r\n  towards the central body, the sun. Organisms of the present tropical\r\n  world buried in the icy north—pp. 373–375.\r\n\r\n\r\n SCIENTIFIC ILLUSTRATIONS AND ADDITIONS                     pp. 376–379.\r\n\r\n  Barometric measurements on Vesuvius, comparison of the two\r\n  crater-margins and the Rocca del Palo—pp. 376–379. Increase of\r\n  temperature with depth, being 1° of Fahrenheit for every 54 feet.\r\n  Temperature of the Artesian well in Oeynhausen’s Bath (New Salt-works\r\n  near Minden), at the greatest depth yet reached below the level of the\r\n  sea.

Difference of views concerning the necessity and\r\n  nonnecessity for the assumption of peculiar vital forces—pp. 386–387.\r\n  The difficulty of satisfactorily reducing the vital phenomena of the\r\n  organism to physical and chemical laws is, principally, based on the\r\n  complexity of the phenomena, on the multiplicity of forces acting\r\n  simultaneously, as well as on the varying conditions of their\r\n  activity. Definition of the expressions, _animate_ and _inanimate_\r\n  matter. Criteria of the miscent state ensuing upon separation, are the\r\n  simple enunciation of a fact—pp. 387–389.\r\n\r\n\r\n THE PLATEAU OF CAXAMARCA, THE ANCIENT CAPITAL OF THE INCA\r\n   ATAHUALLPA, AND FIRST VIEW OF THE PACIFIC FROM THE RIDGE\r\n   OF THE ANDES.                                            pp. 390–420.\r\n\r\n  Cinchona, or Quina-woods in the valleys of Loxa.

Warm baths of the Inca. Ruins of Atahuallpa’s palace,\r\n  inhabited by his indigent descendants, the family of Astorpilca.\r\n  Belief entertained there, in the existence of subterranean golden\r\n  gardens of the Inca; said to be situated in the lovely valley of\r\n  Yucay, under the Temple of the Sun at Cuzco, and at many other points.\r\n  Conversation with the son of the Curaca Astorpilca. The room is still\r\n  shown in which the unfortunate Atahuallpa was kept prisoner for nine\r\n  months, from the November of 1532; also the wall on which he made a\r\n  mark to indicate the height to which he would cause the room to be\r\n  filled with gold, if his persecutors would set him free. Account of\r\n  the prince’s execution on the 29th of August, 1533, and remarks on the\r\n  so-called “indelible blood stain” on a stone slab before the altar in\r\n  the chapel of the city prison—pp. 406–414.

When the traveller\r\nturns from the Alpine valleys of Caracas, and the island-studded lake of\r\nTacarigua[1], whose waters reflect the forms of the neighbouring\r\nbananas,—when he leaves the fields verdant with the light and tender\r\ngreen of the Tahitian sugar-cane, or the sombre shade of the cacoa\r\ngroves,—his eye rests in the south on Steppes, whose seeming elevations\r\ndisappear in the distant horizon.\r\n\r\nFrom the rich luxuriance of organic life the astonished traveller\r\nsuddenly finds himself on the dreary margin of a treeless waste. Nor\r\nhill, nor cliff rears its head, like an island in the ocean, above the\r\nboundless plain: only here and there broken strata of floetz, extending\r\nover a surface of two hundred square miles, (more than three thousand\r\nEnglish square miles[C],) appear sensibly higher than the surrounding\r\ndistrict. The natives term them _banks_[2], as if the spirit of language\r\nwould convey some record of that ancient condition of the world, when\r\nthese elevations formed the shoals, and the Steppes themselves the\r\nbottom, of some vast inland sea.\r\n\r\nEven now, illusion often recalls, in the obscurity of night, these\r\nimages of a former age. For when the guiding constellations illumine the\r\nmargin of the plain with their rapidly rising and setting beams, or when\r\ntheir flickering forms are reflected in the lower stratum of undulating\r\nvapour, a shoreless ocean seems spread before us[3]. Like a limitless\r\nexpanse of waters, the Steppe fills the mind with a sense of the\r\ninfinite, and the soul, freed from the sensuous impressions of space,\r\nexpands with spiritual emotions of a higher order. But the aspect of the\r\nocean, its bright surface diversified with rippling or gently swelling\r\nwaves, is productive of pleasurable sensations,—while the Steppe lies\r\nstretched before us, cold and monotonous, like the naked stony crust of\r\nsome desolate planet[4].\r\n\r\nIn all latitudes nature presents the phenomenon of these vast plains,\r\nand each has some peculiar character or physiognomy, determined by\r\ndiversity of soil and climate, and by elevation above the level of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nIn northern Europe the Heaths which, covered by one sole form of\r\nvegetation, to the exclusion of all others, extend from the extremity of\r\nJutland to the mouth of the Scheldt, may be regarded as true Steppes.\r\nThey are, however, both hilly and of very inconsiderable extent when\r\ncompared with the Llanos and Pampas of South America, or even with the\r\nPrairies on the Missouri[5] and Copper River, the resort of the shaggy\r\nBison and the small Musk Ox.\r\n\r\nThe plains in the interior of Africa present a grander and more imposing\r\nspectacle. Like the wide expanse of the Pacific, they have remained\r\nunexplored until recent times. They are portions of a sea of sand, which\r\ntowards the east separates fruitful regions from each other, or incloses\r\nthem like islands, as the desert near the basaltic mountains of\r\nHarudsch[6], where, in the Oasis of Siwah, rich in date-trees, the ruins\r\nof the temple of Ammon indicate the venerable seat of early\r\ncivilization. Neither dew nor rain refreshes these barren wastes, or\r\nunfolds the germs of vegetation within the glowing depths of the earth;\r\nfor everywhere rising columns of hot air dissolve the vapours and\r\ndisperse the passing clouds.\r\n\r\nWherever the desert approaches the Atlantic Ocean, as between Wadi Nun\r\nand the White Cape, the moist sea-air rushes in to fill the vacuum\r\ncaused by these vertically ascending currents of air. The navigator, in\r\nsteering towards the mouth of the river Gambia, through a sea thickly\r\ncarpeted with weeds, infers by the sudden cessation of the tropical east\r\nwind[7], that he is near the far-spreading and radiating sandy desert.\r\n\r\nFlocks of swift-looted ostriches and herds of gazelles wander over this\r\nboundless space. With the exception of the newly discovered group of\r\nOases, rich in springs, whose verdant banks are frequented by nomadic\r\ntribes of Tibbos and Tuarycks[8], the whole of the African deserts may\r\nbe regarded as uninhabitable by man. It is only periodically that the\r\nneighbouring civilized nations venture to traverse them. On tracks whose\r\nundeviating course was determined by commercial intercourse thousands of\r\nyears ago, the long line of caravans passes from Tafilet to Timbuctoo,\r\nor from Mourzouk to Bornou; daring enterprises, the practicability of\r\nwhich depends on the existence of the camel, _the ship of the\r\ndesert_[9], as it is termed in the ancient legends of the East.\r\n\r\nThese African plains cover an area which exceeds almost three times that\r\nof the neighbouring Mediterranean. They are situated partly within and\r\npartly near the tropics, a position on which depends their individual\r\nnatural character. On the other hand, in the eastern portion of the old\r\ncontinent the same geognostic phenomenon is peculiar to the temperate\r\nzone.\r\n\r\nOn the mountainous range of Central Asia, between the Gold or Altai\r\nMountain and the Kouen-lien[10], from the Chinese wall to the further\r\nside of the Celestial Mountains, and towards the Sea of Aral, over a\r\nspace of several thousand miles, extend, if not the highest, certainly\r\nthe largest Steppes in the world. I myself enjoyed an opportunity, full\r\nthirty years after my South American travels, of visiting that portion\r\nof the Steppes which is occupied by Kalmuck-Kirghis tribes, and is\r\nsituated between the Don, the Volga, the Caspian Sea, and the Chinese\r\nLake of Dsaisang, and which consequently extends over an area of nearly\r\n2,800 geographical miles. The vegetation of the Asiatic Steppes, which\r\nare sometimes hilly and interspersed with pine forests, is in its\r\ngroupings far more varied than that of the Llanos and the Pampas of\r\nCaracas and Buenos Ayres. The more beautiful portions of the plains,\r\ninhabited by Asiatic pastoral tribes, are adorned with lowly shrubs of\r\nluxuriant white-blossomed Rosaceæ, Crown Imperials (Fritillariæ),\r\nCypripedeæ, and Tulips. As the torrid zone is in general distinguished\r\nby a tendency in the vegetable forms to become arborescent, so we also\r\nfind, that some of the Asiatic Steppes of the temperate zone are\r\ncharacterized by the remarkable height to which flowering plants attain;\r\nas, for instance, Saussureæ, and other Synanthereæ; all siliquose\r\nplants, and particularly numerous species of Astragalus. On crossing the\r\ntrackless portions of the herb-covered Steppes in the low carriages of\r\nthe Tartars, it is necessary to stand upright in order to ascertain the\r\ndirection to be pursued through the copse-like and closely crowded\r\nplants that bend under the wheels. Some of these Steppes are covered\r\nwith grass; others with succulent, evergreen, articulated alkaline\r\nplants; while many are radiant with the effulgence of lichen-like tufts\r\nof salt, scattered irregularly over the clayey soil like newly fallen\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nThese Mongolian and Tartar Steppes, which are intersected by numerous\r\nmountain chains, separate the ancient and long-civilized races of Thibet\r\nand Hindostan from the rude nations of Northern Asia. They have also\r\nexerted a manifold influence on the changing destinies of mankind. They\r\nhave inclined the current of population southward, impeded the\r\nintercourse of nations more than the Himalayas, or the Snowy Mountains\r\nof Sirinagur and Gorka, and placed permanent limits to the progress of\r\ncivilization and refinement in a northerly direction.\r\n\r\nHistory cannot, however, regard the plains of Central Asia under the\r\ncharacter of obstructive barriers alone. They have frequently proved the\r\nmeans of spreading misery and devastation over the face of the earth.\r\nSome of the pastoral tribes inhabiting this Steppe,—the Mongols, Getæ,\r\nAlani, and Usüni,—have convulsed the world. If in the course of earlier\r\nages, the dawn of civilization spread like the vivifying light of the\r\nsun from east to west; so in subsequent ages and from the same quarter,\r\nhave barbarism and rudeness threatened to overcloud Europe.\r\n\r\nA tawny tribe of herdsmen[11] of Tukiuish _i. e._, Turkish origin, the\r\nHiongnu, dwelt in tents of skins on the elevated Steppe of Gobi. A\r\nportion of this race had been driven southward towards the interior of\r\nAsia, after continuing for a long time formidable to the Chinese power.\r\nThis shock, (dislodgement of the tribes) was communicated\r\nuninterruptedly as far as the ancient land of the Fins, near the sources\r\nof the Ural.[D] From thence poured forth bands of Huns, Avars, Chasars,\r\nand a numerous admixture of Asiatic races. Warlike bodies of Huns first\r\nappeared on the Volga, next in Pannonia, then on the Marne and the banks\r\nof the Po, laying waste those richly cultivated tracts, where, since the\r\nage of Antenor, man’s creative art had piled monument on monument. Thus\r\nswept a pestilential breath from the Mongolian deserts over the fair\r\nCisalpine soil, stifling the tender, long-cherished blossoms of art!\r\n\r\nFrom the Salt-steppes of Asia,—from the European Heaths,—smiling in\r\nsummer with their scarlet, honey-yielding flowers,—and from the barren\r\ndeserts of Africa, we return to the plains of South America, the picture\r\nof which I have already begun to sketch in rude outline.\r\n\r\nBut the interest yielded by the contemplation of such a picture must\r\narise from a pure love of nature. No Oasis here reminds the traveller of\r\nformer inhabitants, no hewn stone[12], no fruit-tree once cultivated and\r\nnow growing wild, bears witness to the industry of past races. As if a\r\nstranger to the destinies of mankind, and bound to the present alone,\r\nthis region of the earth presents a wild domain to the free\r\nmanifestation of animal and vegetable life.\r\n\r\nThe Steppe extends from the littoral chain of Caracas to the forests of\r\nGuiana, and from the snow-covered mountains of Merida, on whose\r\ndeclivity lies the Natron lake of Urao,—the object of the religious\r\nsuperstition of the natives,—to the vast delta formed by the mouth of\r\nthe Orinoco. To the south-west it stretches like an arm of the sea[13],\r\nbeyond the banks of the Meta and of the Vichada, to the unexplored\r\nsources of the Guaviare, and to the solitary mountain group to which the\r\nvivid imagination of the Spanish warriors gave the name of _Paramo de la\r\nSuma Paz_, as though it were the beautiful seat of eternal repose.\r\n\r\nThis Steppe incloses an area of 256,000 square miles. Owing to\r\ninaccurate geographical data, it has often been described as extending\r\nin equal breadth to the Straits of Magellan, unmindful that it is\r\nintersected by the wooded plain of the Amazon, which is bounded to the\r\nnorth by the grassy Steppes of the Apure, and to the south by those of\r\nthe Rio de la Plata. The Andes of Cochabamba and the Brazilian mountains\r\napproximate each other by means of separate transverse spurs, projecting\r\nbetween the province of Chiquitos and the isthmus of Villabella[14]. A\r\nnarrow plain unites the _Hylæa_ of the Amazon with the Pampas of Buenos\r\nAyres. The area of the latter is three times larger than that of the\r\nLlanos of Venezuela; indeed so vast in extent, that it is bounded on the\r\nnorth by palms, while its southern extremity is almost covered with\r\nperpetual ice. The Tuyu, which resembles the Cassowary, (Struthio Rhea,)\r\nis peculiar to these Pampas, as are also those herds of wild dogs[15],\r\nwhich dwell in social community in subterranean caverns, and often\r\nferociously attack man, for whose defence their progenitors fought.\r\n\r\nLike the greater part of the desert of Sahara[16], the Llanos, the most\r\nnorthern plains of South America, lie within the torrid zone. Twice in\r\nevery year they change their whole aspect, during one half of it\r\nappearing waste and barren like the Lybian desert; during the other,\r\ncovered with verdure, like many of the elevated Steppes of Central\r\nAsia[17].\r\n\r\nThe attempt to compare the natural characteristics of remote regions,\r\nand to pourtray the results of this comparison in brief outline, though\r\na gratifying, is a somewhat difficult branch of physical geography.\r\n\r\nA number of causes, many of them still but little understood[18],\r\ndiminish the dryness and heat of the New World. Among these are: the\r\nnarrowness of this extensively indented continent in the northern part\r\nof the tropics, where the fluid basis on which the atmosphere rests,\r\noccasions the ascent of a less warm current of air; its wide extension\r\ntowards both the icy poles; a broad ocean swept by cool tropical winds;\r\nthe flatness of the eastern shores; currents of cold sea-water from the\r\nantarctic region, which, at first following a direction from south-west\r\nto north-east, strike the coast of Chili below the parallel of 35° south\r\nlat., and advance as far north on the coasts of Peru as Cape Pariña,\r\nwhere they suddenly diverge towards the west; the numerous mountains\r\nabounding in springs, whose snow-crowned summits soar above the strata\r\nof clouds, and cause the descent of currents of air down their\r\ndeclivities; the abundance of rivers of enormous breadth, which after\r\nmany windings invariably seek the most distant coast; Steppes, devoid of\r\nsand, and therefore less readily acquiring heat; impenetrable forests,\r\nwhich, protecting the earth from the sun’s rays, or radiating heat from\r\nthe surface of their leaves, cover the richly-watered plains of the\r\nEquator, and exhale into the interior of the country, most remote from\r\nmountains and the Ocean, prodigious quantities of moisture, partly\r\nabsorbed and partly generated—all these causes produce in the flat\r\nportions of America a climate which presents a most striking contrast in\r\npoint of humidity and coolness with that of Africa. On these alone\r\ndepend the luxuriant and exuberant vegetation and that richness of\r\nfoliage which are so peculiarly characteristic of the New Continent.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the atmosphere on one side of our planet be more humid\r\nthan on the other, a consideration of the actual condition of things\r\nwill be sufficient to solve the problem of this inequality. The natural\r\nphilosopher need not shroud the explanation of such phenomena in the\r\ngarb of geological myths. It is not necessary to assume that the\r\ndestructive conflict of the elements raged at different epochs in the\r\neastern and western hemispheres, during the early condition of our\r\nplanet; or that America emerged subsequently to the other quarters of\r\nthe world from the chaotic covering of waters, as a swampy island, the\r\nabode of crocodiles and serpents[19].\r\n\r\nSouth America presents indeed a remarkable similarity to the\r\nsouth-western peninsula of the old continent, in the form of its\r\noutlines and the direction of its coast-line. But the internal structure\r\nof the soil, and its relative position with respect to the contiguous\r\nmasses of land, occasion in Africa that remarkable aridity which over a\r\nvast area checks the development of organic life. Four-fifths of South\r\nAmerica lie beyond the Equator, and therefore in a region which, on\r\naccount of its abundant waters, as well as from many other causes, is\r\ncooler and moister than our northern hemisphere[20]. To this,\r\nnevertheless, the most considerable portion of Africa belongs.\r\n\r\nThe extent from east to west of the South American Steppes or Llanos, is\r\nonly one third that of the African Desert. The former are refreshed by\r\nthe tropical sea wind, while the latter, situated in the same parallel\r\nof latitude as Arabia and Southern Persia, are visited by currents of\r\nair which have passed over heat-radiating continents. The venerable\r\nfather of history, Herodotus, so long insufficiently appreciated, has in\r\nthe true spirit of a comprehensive observer of nature, described all the\r\ndeserts of Northern Africa, Yemen, Kerman, and Mekran (the Gedrosia of\r\nthe Greeks), as far even as Mooltan in Western India, as one sole\r\nconnected sea of sand[21].\r\n\r\nTo the action of hot land winds, may be associated in Africa, as far as\r\nwe know, a deficiency of large rivers, of forests that generate cold by\r\nexhaling aqueous vapour, and of lofty mountains. The only spot covered\r\nwith perpetual snow is the western portion of Mount Atlas[22], whose\r\nnarrow ridge, seen laterally, appeared to the ancient navigators when\r\ncoasting the shore, as one solitary and aërial pillar of heaven. This\r\nmountain range extends eastward to Dakul, where the famed Carthage, once\r\nmistress of the seas, lies in crumbling ruins. This range forms a far\r\nextended coast-line or Gætulian rampart, which repels the cool north\r\nwinds and with them the vapours rising from the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe Mountains of the Moon, Djebel-al-Komr[23], fabulously represented as\r\nforming a mountainous parallel between the elevated plain of Habesch—an\r\nAfrican Quito—and the sources of the Senegal, were supposed to rise\r\nabove the lower sea line. Even the Cordilleras of Lupata, which skirt\r\nthe eastern coast of Mozambique and Monomotapa, in the same manner as\r\nthe Andes bound the western shores of Peru, are covered with eternal\r\nsnow in the gold districts of Machinga and Mocanga. But these mountains,\r\nabundantly watered, are situated at a considerable distance from the\r\nvast desert which extends from the southern declivity of the chain of\r\nAtlas to the Niger, whose waters flow in an easterly direction.\r\n\r\nPossibly, these combined causes of aridity and heat would have proved\r\ninsufficient to convert such large portions of the African plains into a\r\ndreary waste, had not some convulsion of nature—as for instance the\r\nirruption of the ocean—on some occasion deprived these flat regions of\r\ntheir nutrient soil, as well as of the vegetation which it supported.\r\nThe epoch when this occurred, and the nature of the forces which\r\ndetermined the irruption, are alike shrouded in the obscurity of the\r\npast. Perhaps it may have been the result of the great rotatory\r\ncurrent[24], which drives the warmer waters of the Gulf of Mexico over\r\nthe bank of Newfoundland to the old continent, and by which the\r\ncocoa-nut of the West Indies and other tropical fruits have been borne\r\nto the shores of Ireland and Norway. One branch of this oceanic current,\r\nafter it leaves the Azores, has still, at the present time, a\r\nsouth-easterly course, striking the low range of the sandy coasts of\r\nAfrica with a force that is frequently fraught with danger to the\r\nmariner. All sea-coasts—but I refer here more particularly to the\r\nPeruvian shore between Amotape and Coquimbo—afford evidence of the\r\nhundreds, or even thousands of years, which must pass before the moving\r\nsand can yield a firm basis for the roots of herbaceous plants, in those\r\nhot and rainless regions where neither Lecideæ nor other lichens can\r\ngrow[25].\r\n\r\nThese considerations suffice to explain why, notwithstanding their\r\nexternal similarity of form, the continents of Africa and South America\r\npresent the most widely different climatic relations and characters of\r\nvegetation. Although the South American Steppe is covered with a thin\r\ncrust of fruitful earth, is periodically refreshed by rains, and adorned\r\nwith luxuriant herbage, its attractions were not sufficient to induce\r\nthe neighbouring nations to exchange the beautiful mountain valleys of\r\nCaracas, the sea-girt districts, and the richly watered plains of the\r\nOrinoco, for this treeless and springless desert. Hence on the arrival\r\nof the first European and African settlers, the Steppe was found to be\r\nalmost without inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe Llanos are, it is true, adapted for the breeding of cattle, but the\r\nprimitive inhabitants of the new continent were almost wholly\r\nunacquainted with the management of animals yielding milk[26]. Scarcely\r\none of the American tribes knew how to avail themselves of the\r\nadvantages which nature, in this respect, had placed before them. The\r\nAmerican aborigines, who, from 65° north lat. to 55° south lat.,\r\nconstitute (with the exception, perhaps, of the Esquimaux,) but one sole\r\nrace, passed directly from a hunting to an agricultural life without\r\ngoing through the intermediate stage of a pastoral life. Two species of\r\nindigenous homed cattle (the Buffalo and the Musk Ox) graze on the\r\npasture lands of Western Canada and Quivira, as well as in the\r\nneighbourhood of the colossal ruins of the Aztek fortress, which rises\r\nlike some American Palmyra on the desert solitudes of the river Gila. A\r\nlong-horned _Mouflon_, resembling the so-called progenitor of the sheep,\r\nroams over the parched and barren limestone rocks of California; while\r\nthe camel-like Vicunas, Huanacos, Alpacas, and Llamas, are natives of\r\nthe southern peninsula. But of these useful animals the two first only\r\n(viz. the Buffalo and the Musk Ox) have preserved their natural freedom\r\nfor thousands of years. The use of milk and cheese, like the possession\r\nand culture of farinaceous grasses, is a distinctive characteristic of\r\nthe nations of the old world[27].\r\n\r\nIf some few tribes have passed through Northern Asia to the western\r\ncoast of America, and preferring to keep within a temperate climate,\r\nhave followed the course of the ridges of the Andes southward[28], such\r\nmigrations must have been made by routes on which the settlers were\r\nunable to transport either flocks or grain. The question here arises,\r\nwhether on the downfall of the long-declining empire of the Hiongnu, the\r\nconsequent migration of this powerful race may not have been the means\r\nof drawing from the north-east of China and Korea, bands of settlers, by\r\nwhom Asiatic civilisation was transported to the new continent? If the\r\nprimitive colonists had been natives of those Steppes in which\r\nagriculture was unknown, this bold hypothesis (which as yet is but\r\nlittle warranted by etymological comparisons) would at all events\r\nexplain the remarkable absence of the Cereals in America. Perhaps\r\ncontrary winds may have driven to the shores of New California one of\r\nthose Asiatic Priest-colonies who were instigated by their mystic\r\ndreameries to undertake distant voyages, and of which the history of the\r\npeopling of Japan, at the time of the _Thsinschihuang-ti_, affords a\r\nmemorable instance.[29]\r\n\r\nIf a pastoral life—that beneficent intermediate stage which binds\r\nnomadic bands of hunters to fruitful pasture lands, and at the same time\r\npromotes agriculture—was unknown to the primitive races of America, it\r\nis to the very ignorance of such a mode of life that we must attribute\r\nthe scantiness of population in the South American Steppes. But this\r\ncircumstance allowed freer scope for the forces of nature to develop\r\nthemselves in the most varied forms of animal life; a freedom only\r\ncircumscribed by themselves, like vegetable life in the forests of the\r\nOrinoco, where the Hymenæa and the giant laurel, exempt from the ravages\r\nof man, are only in danger of a too luxuriant embrace of the plants\r\nwhich surround them.\r\n\r\nAgoutis, small spotted antelopes, the shielded Armadillo, which,\r\nrat-like, terrifies the hare in its subterranean retreat; herds of\r\nslothful Chiguires, beautifully striped Viverræ, whose pestilential\r\nodour infects the air; the great maneless Lion; the variegated Jaguar\r\n(commonly known as the tiger), whose strength enables it to drag to the\r\nsummit of a hill the body of the young bull it has slain—these, and many\r\nother forms of animal life[30] roam over the treeless plain.\r\n\r\nThis region, which may be regarded as peculiarly the habitation of wild\r\nanimals, would not have been chosen as a place of settlement by nomadic\r\nhordes, who like the Indo-Asiatics generally prefer a vegetable diet,\r\nhad it not possessed some few fan-palms (_Mauritia_) scattered here and\r\nthere. The beneficent qualities of this tree of life have been\r\nuniversally celebrated.[31] Upon this alone subsist the unsubdued tribe\r\nof the Guaranes, at the mouth of the Orinoco northward of the Sierra de\r\nImataca. When they increased in numbers and became over-crowded, it is\r\nsaid that, besides the huts which they built on horizontal platforms\r\nsupported by the stumps of felled palm-trees, they also ingeniously\r\nsuspended from stem to stem spreading mats or hammocks woven of the\r\nleaf-stalk of the Mauritia, which enabled them, during the rainy season,\r\nwhen the Delta was overflowed, to live in trees in the manner of apes.\r\nThese pendent huts were partly covered with clay. The women kindled the\r\nfire necessary for their culinary occupations on the humid flooring. As\r\nthe traveller passed by night along the river, his attention was\r\nattracted by a long line of flame suspended high in the air, and\r\napparently unconnected with the earth. The Guaranes owe the preservation\r\nof their physical, and perhaps even of their moral independence, to the\r\nloose marshy soil, over which they move with fleet and buoyant foot, and\r\nto their lofty sylvan domiciles; a sanctuary whither religious\r\nenthusiasm would hardly lead an American Stylite.[32]\r\n\r\nThe Mauritia not only affords a secure habitation, but likewise yields\r\nnumerous articles of food. Before the tender spathe unfolds its blossoms\r\non the male palm, and only at that peculiar period of vegetable\r\nmetamorphosis, the medullary portion of the trunk is found to contain a\r\nsago-like meal, which like that of the Jatropha root, is dried in thin\r\nbreadlike slices. The sap of the tree when fermented constitutes the\r\nsweet inebriating palm-wine of the Guaranes. The narrow-scaled fruit,\r\nwhich resembles reddish pine-cones, yields, like the banana and almost\r\nall tropical fruits, different articles of food, according to the\r\nperiods at which it is gathered, whether its saccharine properties are\r\nfully matured, or whether it is still in a farinaceous condition. Thus\r\nin the lowest grades of man’s development, we find the existence of an\r\nentire race dependent upon almost a single tree; like certain insects\r\nwhich are confined to particular portions of a flower.\r\n\r\nSince the discovery of the new continent, its plains (Llanos) have\r\nbecome habitable to man. Here and there towns[33] have sprung up on the\r\nshores of the Steppe-rivers, built to facilitate the intercourse between\r\nthe coasts and Guiana (the Orinoco district). Everywhere throughout\r\nthese vast districts the inhabitants have begun to rear cattle. At\r\ndistances of a day’s journey from each other, we see detached huts,\r\nwoven together with reeds and thongs, and covered with ox-hides.\r\nInnumerable herds of oxen, horses, and mules (estimated at the peaceful\r\nperiod of my travels at a million and a half) roam over the Steppe in a\r\nstate of wildness. The prodigious increase of these animals of the old\r\nworld is the more remarkable, from the numerous perils with which, in\r\nthese regions, they have to contend.\r\n\r\nWhen, beneath the vertical rays of the bright and cloudless sun of the\r\ntropics, the parched sward crumbles into dust, then the indurated soil\r\ncracks and bursts as if rent asunder by some mighty earthquake. And if,\r\nat such a time, two opposite currents of air, by conflict moving in\r\nrapid gyrations, come in contact with the earth, a singular spectacle\r\npresents itself. Like funnel-shaped clouds,[34] their apexes touching\r\nthe earth, the sands rise in vapoury form through the rarefied air in\r\nthe electrically-charged centre of the whirling current, sweeping on\r\nlike the rushing water-spout, which strikes such terror into the heart\r\nof the mariner. A dim and sallow light gleams from the lowering sky over\r\nthe dreary plain. The horizon suddenly contracts, and the heart of the\r\ntraveller sinks with dismay as the wide Steppe seems to close upon him\r\non all sides. The hot and dusty earth forms a cloudy veil which shrouds\r\nthe heavens from view, and increases the stifling oppression of the\r\natmosphere[35]; while the east wind, when it blows over the long-heated\r\nsoil, instead of cooling, adds to the burning glow.\r\n\r\nGradually, too, the pools of water, which had been protected from\r\nevaporation by the now seared foliage of the fan-palm, disappear. As in\r\nthe icy north animals become torpid from cold, so here the crocodile and\r\nthe boa-constrictor lie wrapt in unbroken sleep, deeply buried in the\r\ndried soil. Everywhere the drought announces death, yet everywhere the\r\nthirsting wanderer is deluded by the phantom of a moving, undulating,\r\nwatery surface, created by the deceptive play of the reflected rays of\r\nlight (the mirage[36]). A narrow stratum separates the ground from the\r\ndistant palm-trees, which seem to hover aloft, owing to the contact of\r\ncurrents of air having different degrees of heat and therefore of\r\ndensity[E]. Shrouded in dark clouds of dust, and tortured by hunger and\r\nburning thirst, oxen and horses scour the plain, the one bellowing\r\ndismally, the other with outstretched necks snuffing the wind, in the\r\nendeavour to detect, by the moisture in the air, the vicinity of some\r\npool of water not yet wholly evaporated.\r\n\r\nThe mule, more cautious and cunning, adopts another method of allaying\r\nhis thirst. There is a globular and articulated plant, the\r\nMelocactus[37], which encloses under its prickly integument an aqueous\r\npulp. After carefully striking away the prickles with his forefeet, the\r\nmule cautiously ventures to apply his lips to imbibe the cooling thistle\r\njuice. But the draught from this living vegetable spring is not always\r\nunattended by danger, and these animals are often observed to have been\r\nlamed by the puncture of the cactus thorn.\r\n\r\nEven if the burning heat of day be succeeded by the cool freshness of\r\nthe night, here always of equal length, the wearied ox and horse enjoy\r\nno repose. Huge bats now attack the animals during sleep, and\r\nvampyre-like suck their blood;[F] or, fastening on their backs, raise\r\nfestering wounds, in which mosquitoes, hippobosces, and a host of other\r\nstinging insects, burrow and nestle. Such is the miserable existence of\r\nthese poor animals when the heat of the sun has absorbed the waters from\r\nthe surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen, after a long drought, the genial season of rain arrives, the scene\r\nsuddenly changes[38]. The deep azure of the hitherto cloudless sky\r\nassumes a lighter hue. Scarcely can the dark space in the constellation\r\nof the Southern Cross be distinguished at night. The mild\r\nphosphorescence of the Magellanic clouds fades away. Even the vertical\r\nstars of the constellations Aquila and Ophiuchus shine with a flickering\r\nand less planetary light. Like some distant mountain, a single cloud is\r\nseen rising perpendicularly on the southern horizon. Misty vapours\r\ncollect and gradually overspread the heavens, while distant thunder\r\nproclaims the approach of the vivifying rain.\r\n\r\nScarcely is the surface of the earth moistened before the teeming Steppe\r\nbecomes covered with Kyllingiæ, with the many-panicled Paspalum, and a\r\nvariety of grasses. Excited by the power of light, the herbaceous Mimosa\r\nunfolds its dormant, drooping leaves, hailing, as it were, the rising\r\nsun in chorus with the matin song of the birds and the opening flowers\r\nof aquatics. Horses and oxen, buoyant with life and enjoyment, roam over\r\nand crop the plains. The luxuriant grass hides the beautifully spotted\r\nJaguar, who, lurking in safe concealment, and carefully measuring the\r\nextent of the leap, darts, like the Asiatic tiger, with a cat-like bound\r\non his passing prey.\r\n\r\nAt times, according to the account of the natives, the humid clay on the\r\nbanks of the morasses[39], is seen to rise slowly in broad flakes.\r\nAccompanied by a violent noise, as on the eruption of a small\r\nmud-volcano, the upheaved earth is hurled high into the air. Those who\r\nare familiar with the phenomenon fly from it; for a colossal water-snake\r\nor a mailed and scaly crocodile, awakened from its trance by the first\r\nfall of rain, is about to burst from his tomb.\r\n\r\nWhen the rivers bounding the plain to the south, as the Arauca, the\r\nApure, and the Payara, gradually overflow their banks, nature compels\r\nthose creatures to live as amphibious animals, which, during the first\r\nhalf of the year, were perishing with thirst on the waterless and dusty\r\nplain. A part of the steppe now presents the appearance of a vast inland\r\nsea[40]. The mares retreat with their foals to the higher banks, which\r\nproject, like islands, above the spreading waters. Day by day the dry\r\nsurface diminishes in extent. The cattle, crowded together, and deprived\r\nof pasturage, swim for hours about the inundated plain, seeking a scanty\r\nnourishment from the flowering panicles of the grasses which rise above\r\nthe lurid and bubbling waters. Many foals are drowned, many are seized\r\nby crocodiles, crushed by their serrated tails, and devoured. Horses and\r\noxen may not unfrequently be seen which have escaped from the fury of\r\nthis blood-thirsty and gigantic lizard, bearing on their legs the marks\r\nof its pointed teeth.\r\n\r\nThis spectacle involuntarily reminds the contemplative observer of the\r\nadaptability granted by an all-provident nature to certain animals and\r\nplants. Like the farinaceous fruits of Ceres, the ox and horse have\r\nfollowed man over the whole surface of the earth—from the Ganges to the\r\nRio de la Plata, and from the sea-coast of Africa to the mountainous\r\nplain of Antisana, which lies higher than the Peak of Teneriffe[41]. In\r\nthe one region the northern birch, in the other the date-palm, protects\r\nthe wearied ox from the noonday sun. The same species of animal which\r\ncontends in eastern Europe with bears and wolves, is exposed, in a\r\ndifferent latitude, to the attacks of tigers and crocodiles!\r\n\r\nThe crocodile and the jaguar are not, however, the only enemies that\r\nthreaten the South American horse; for even among the fishes it has a\r\ndangerous foe. The marshy waters of Bera and Rastro[42] are filled with\r\ninnumerable electric eels, who can at pleasure discharge from every part\r\nof their slimy, yellow-speckled bodies a deadening shock. This species\r\nof gymnotus is about five or six feet in length. It is powerful enough\r\nto kill the largest animals when it discharges its nervous organs at one\r\nshock in a favourable direction. It was once found necessary to change\r\nthe line of road from Uritucu across the Steppe, owing to the number of\r\nhorses which, in fording a certain rivulet, annually fell a sacrifice to\r\nthese gymnoti, which had accumulated there in great numbers. All other\r\nspecies of fish shun the vicinity of these formidable creatures. Even\r\nthe angler, when fishing from the high bank, is in dread lest an\r\nelectric shock should be conveyed to him along the moistened line. Thus,\r\nin these regions, the electric fire breaks forth from the lowest depths\r\nof the waters.\r\n\r\nThe mode of capturing the gymnotus affords a picturesque spectacle. A\r\nnumber of mules and horses are driven into a swamp, which is closely\r\nsurrounded by Indians, until the unusual noise excites the daring fish\r\nto venture on an attack. Serpent-like they are seen swimming along the\r\nsurface of the water, striving cunningly to glide under the bellies of\r\nthe horses. By the force of their invisible blows numbers of the poor\r\nanimals are suddenly prostrated; others, snorting and panting, their\r\nmanes erect, their eyes wildly flashing with terror, rush madly from the\r\nraging storm; but the Indians, armed with long bamboo staves, drive them\r\nback into the midst of the pool.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the fury of this unequal contest begins to slacken. Like\r\nclouds that have discharged their electricity, the wearied eels\r\ndisperse. They require long rest and nourishing food to repair the\r\ngalvanic force which they have so lavishly expended. Their shocks\r\ngradually become weaker and weaker. Terrified by the noise of the\r\ntrampling horses, they timidly approach the brink of the morass, where\r\nthey are wounded by harpoons, and drawn on shore by non-conducting poles\r\nof dry wood.\r\n\r\nSuch is the remarkable contest between horses and fish. That which\r\nconstitutes the invisible but living weapon of these inhabitants of the\r\nwater—that, which awakened by the contact of moist and dissimilar\r\nparticles[43], circulates through all the organs of animals and\r\nplants—that which flashing amid the roar of thunder illuminates the wide\r\ncanopy of heaven—which binds iron to iron, and directs the silent\r\nrecurring course of the magnetic needle—all, like the varied hues of the\r\nrefracted ray of light, flow from one common source, and all blend\r\ntogether into one eternal all-pervading power.\r\n\r\nI might here close my bold attempt of delineating the natural picture of\r\nthe Steppe; but, as on the ocean, fancy delights in dwelling on the\r\nrecollections of distant shores, so will we, ere the vast plain vanishes\r\nfrom our view, cast a rapid glance over the regions by which the Steppe\r\nis bounded.\r\n\r\nThe northern desert of Africa separates two races of men which\r\noriginally belonged to the same portion of the globe, and whose\r\ninextinguishable feuds appear as old as the myth of Osiris and\r\nTyphon[44]. To the north of Mount Atlas there dwells a race\r\ncharacterised by long and straight hair, a sallow complexion, and\r\nCaucasian features; while to the south of Senegal, in the direction of\r\nSoudan, we find hordes of Negroes occupying various grades in the scale\r\nof civilization. In Central Asia the Mongolian Steppe divides Siberian\r\nbarbarism from the ancient civilization of the peninsula of Hindostan.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the South American Steppes are the boundaries of a\r\nEuropean semi-civilization[45]. To the north, between the mountain chain\r\nof Venezuela and the Caribbean Sea, lie, crowded together, industrial\r\ncities, clean and neat villages, and carefully tilled fields. Even a\r\ntaste for arts, scientific culture, and a noble love of civil freedom,\r\nhave long since been awakened within these regions.\r\n\r\nTo the south, a drear and savage wilderness bounds the Steppe. Forests,\r\nthe growth of thousands of years, in one impenetrable thicket,\r\noverspread the marshy region between the rivers Orinoco and Amazon. Huge\r\nmasses of lead-coloured granite[46] contract the beds of the foaming\r\nrivers. Mountains and forests re-echo with the thunder of rushing\r\nwaters, the roar of the tiger-like jaguar, and the dull rain-foreboding\r\nhowl of the bearded ape[47].\r\n\r\nWhere the shallower parts of the river disclose a sandbank, the\r\ncrocodile may be seen, with open jaws, and motionless as a rock, its\r\nuncouth body often covered with birds[48]; while the chequered\r\nboa-constrictor, its tail lashed round the trunk of a tree, lies coiled\r\nin ambush near the bank, ready to dart with certain aim on its prey.\r\nRapidly uncoiling, it stretches forth its body to seize the young bull,\r\nor some feebler prey, as it fords the stream, and moistening its victim\r\nwith a viscid secretion, laboriously forces it down its dilating\r\nthroat[49].\r\n\r\nIn this grand and wild condition of nature dwell numerous races of men.\r\nSeparated by a remarkable diversity of languages, some are nomadic,\r\nunacquainted with agriculture, and living on ants, gums, and earth, mere\r\noutcasts of humanity[50], such as the Ottomaks and Jarures: others, for\r\ninstance the Maquiritares and Macos, have settled habitations, live on\r\nfruits cultivated by themselves, are intelligent, and of gentler\r\nmanners. Extensive tracts between the Cassiquiare and the Atabapo are\r\ninhabited solely by the Tapir and social apes; not by man. Figures\r\ngraven on the rocks[51] attest that even these deserts were once the\r\nseat of a higher civilization. They bear testimony, as do also the\r\nunequally developed and varying languages (which are amongst the oldest\r\nand most imperishable of the historical records of man), to the changing\r\ndestinies of nations.\r\n\r\nWhile on the Steppe tigers and crocodiles contend with horses and\r\ncattle, so on the forest borders and in the wilds of Guiana the hand of\r\nman is ever raised against his fellow man. With revolting eagerness,\r\nsome tribes drink the flowing blood of their foes, whilst others,\r\nseemingly unarmed, yet prepared for murder, deal certain death with a\r\npoisoned thumb-nail[52]. The feebler tribes, when they tread the sandy\r\nshores, carefully efface with their hands the traces of their trembling\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nThus does man, everywhere alike, on the lowest scale of brutish\r\ndebasement, and in the false glitter of his higher culture, perpetually\r\ncreate for himself a life of care. And thus, too, the traveller,\r\nwandering over the wide world by sea and land, and the historian who\r\nsearches the records of bygone ages, are everywhere met by the unvarying\r\nand melancholy spectacle of man opposed to man.\r\n\r\nHe, therefore, who amid the discordant strife of nations, would seek\r\nintellectual repose, turns with delight to contemplate the silent life\r\nof plants, and to study the hidden forces of nature in her sacred\r\nsanctuaries; or yielding to that inherent impulse, which for thousands\r\nof years has glowed in the breast of man, directs his mind, by a\r\nmysterious presentiment of his destiny, towards the celestial orbs,\r\nwhich, in undisturbed harmony, pursue their ancient and eternal\r\ncourse.[G]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ILLUSTRATIONS AND ADDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  p. 1—“_The Lake of Tacarigua_.”\r\n\r\n  On advancing through the interior of South America, from the coast of\r\n  Caracas or of Venezuela towards the Brazilian frontier (from the 10th\r\n  degree of north latitude to the equator), the traveller first passes a\r\n  lofty chain of mountains (the littoral chain of Caracas) inclining\r\n  from west to east; next vast treeless Steppes or plains (_Los\r\n  Llanos_), which extend from the foot of the littoral chain to the left\r\n  bank of the Orinoco; and, lastly, the mountain range which gives rise\r\n  to the cataracts of Atures and Maypure. This mountain chain, which I\r\n  have named the Sierra Parime, passes in an easterly direction between\r\n  the sources of the Rio Branco and Rio Esquibo, in the direction of\r\n  Dutch and French Guiana. This region, which is the seat of the\r\n  marvellous myths of the Dorado, and is composed of a mountain mass,\r\n  divided into numerous gridiron-like ridges, is bounded on the south by\r\n  the woody plain through which the Rio Negro and the Amazon have formed\r\n  themselves a channel. Those who would seek further instruction\r\n  regarding these geographical relations, may compare the large chart of\r\n  La Cruz Olmedilla (1775), which has served as the basis of nearly all\r\n  the more modern maps of South America, with that of Columbia, which I\r\n  drew up in accordance with my own astronomical determinations of\r\n  place, and published in the year 1825.\r\n\r\n  The littoral chain of Venezuela is, geographically considered, a\r\n  portion of the Peruvian Andes. These are divided at the great mountain\r\n  node of the sources of the Magdalena (lat. 1° 55′ to 2° 20′) into\r\n  three chains, running to the south of Popayan, the easternmost of\r\n  which extends into the snowy mountains of Merida. These mountains\r\n  gradually decline towards the Paramo de las Rosas into the hilly\r\n  district of Quibor and Tocuyo, which connects the littoral chain of\r\n  Venezuela with the Cordilleras of Cundinamarca.\r\n\r\n  This littoral chain extends murally and uninterruptedly from\r\n  Portocabello to the promontory of Paria. Its mean elevation is\r\n  scarcely 750 toises, or 4796 English feet; but some few summits, like\r\n  the Silla de Caracas (also called the Cerro de Avila), which is\r\n  adorned with the purple-flowering Befaria (the red-blossomed American\r\n  Alpine rose), rise 1350 toises, or 8633 English feet above the level\r\n  of the sea. The coast of the Terra Firma everywhere bears traces of\r\n  devastation, giving evidence of the action of the great current which\r\n  runs from east to west, and which, after the disintegration of the\r\n  Caribbean Islands, formed the present Sea of the Antilles. The tongues\r\n  of land of Araya and Chuparipari, and more especially the coasts of\r\n  Cumana and New Barcelona, present to the geologist a remarkable\r\n  aspect. The rocky islands of Boracha, Caracas, and Chimanas rise like\r\n  beacon-towers from the sea, affording evidence of the fearful\r\n  irruption of the waters against the shattered mountain chain. The Sea\r\n  of the Antilles may once have been an inland sea, like the\r\n  Mediterranean, which has suddenly been connected with the ocean. The\r\n  islands of Cuba, Hayti, and Jamaica still exhibit the remains of the\r\n  mountains of micaceous schist which formed the northern boundary of\r\n  this lake. It is a remarkable fact that the highest peaks are situated\r\n  at the very point where these islands approach one another the\r\n  closest. It may be conjectured that the principal nucleus of the chain\r\n  was situated between Cape Tiburon and Morant Point. The height of the\r\n  copper mountains (montañas de cobre) near Saint Iago de Cuba has not\r\n  yet been measured, but this range is probably higher than the Blue\r\n  Mountains of Jamaica (1138 toises, or 7277 English feet), whose\r\n  elevation somewhat exceeds that of the Pass of St. Gothard. I have\r\n  already expressed my conjectures more fully regarding the valley-like\r\n  form of the Atlantic Ocean, and the ancient connection of the\r\n  continents, in a treatise written at Cumana, entitled _Fragment d’un\r\n  Tableau géologique de l’Amérique méridionale_, which appeared in the\r\n  _Journal de Physique, Messidor, an_ IX. It is remarkable that Columbus\r\n  himself makes mention, in his official report, of the connection\r\n  between the course of the equinoctial current and the form of the\r\n  coast-line of the Greater Antilles.[H]\r\n\r\n  The northern and more cultivated portion of the province of Caracas is\r\n  a mountainous region. The marginal chain is divided, like that of the\r\n  Swiss Alps, into many ranges, enclosing longitudinal valleys. The most\r\n  remarkable among these is the charming valley of Aragua, which\r\n  produces an abundance of indigo, sugar, and cotton, and, what is\r\n  perhaps the most singular of all, even European wheat. The southern\r\n  margin of this valley is bounded by the beautiful Lake of Valencia,\r\n  the ancient Indian name of which was Tacarigua. The contrast presented\r\n  by its opposite shores gives it a striking resemblance to the Lake of\r\n  Geneva. The barren mountains of Guigue and Guiripa have indeed less\r\n  grandeur and solemnity of character than the Savoy Alps; but, on the\r\n  other hand, the opposite shore, which is covered with bananas, mimosæ,\r\n  and triplaris, far surpasses in picturesque beauty the vineyards of\r\n  the Pays de Vaud. The lake is 10 leagues, (of which 20 form a degree\r\n  of the Equator), _i.e._, about 30 geographical miles, in length, and\r\n  is thickly studded with small islands, which continually increase in\r\n  size, owing to the evaporation being greater than the influx of fresh\r\n  water. Within the last few years several sandbanks have even become\r\n  true islands, and have acquired the significant name of _Las\r\n  Aparecidas_, or the “_Newly Appeared_.” On the island of Cura the\r\n  remarkable species of solanum is cultivated, which has edible fruit,\r\n  and has been described by Willdenow (in his _Hortus Berolinensis_,\r\n  1816, Tab. xxvii.). The elevation of the Lake of Tacarigua above the\r\n  level of the sea is almost 1400 French feet (according to my\r\n  measurement, exactly 230 toises, _i.e._, 1471 English feet) less than\r\n  the mean height of the valley of Caracas. This lake has several\r\n  species of fish peculiar to itself,[I] and ranks among the most\r\n  beautiful and attractive natural scenes that I am acquainted with in\r\n  any part of the earth. When bathing, Bonpland and myself were often\r\n  terrified by the appearance of the _Bava_, a species of\r\n  crocodile-lizard (_Dragonne?_), hitherto undescribed, from three to\r\n  four feet in length, of repulsive aspect, but harmless to man. We\r\n  found in the Lake of Valencia a _Typha_, perfectly identical with the\r\n  European bulrush, the _Typha angustifolia_—a singular and highly\r\n  important fact in reference to the geography of plants.\r\n\r\n  In the valleys of Aragua, skirting the lake, both varieties of the\r\n  sugar-cane are cultivated, viz., the common _Caña criolla_, and the\r\n  species newly introduced from the South Sea, the _Caña de Otaheiti_.\r\n  The latter variety is of a far lighter and more beautiful green, and a\r\n  field of it may be distinguished from the common sugar-cane at a great\r\n  distance. Cook and George Forster were the first to describe it; but\r\n  it would appear, from Forster’s treatise on the edible plants of the\r\n  South Sea Islands, that they were but little acquainted with the true\r\n  value of this important product. Bougainville brought it to the Isle\r\n  of France, whence it passed to Cayenne and (subsequently to the year\r\n  1792) to Martinique, Saint Domingo or Haiti, and many of the Lesser\r\n  Antilles. The enterprising but unfortunate Captain Bligh transported\r\n  it, together with the bread-fruit tree, to Jamaica. From Trinidad, an\r\n  island contiguous to the continent, the new sugar-cane of the South\r\n  Sea passed to the neighbouring coasts of Caracas. Here it has become\r\n  of greater importance than the bread-fruit tree, which will probably\r\n  never supersede so valuable and nutritious a plant as the banana. The\r\n  Tahitian sugar-cane is more succulent than the common species, which\r\n  is generally supposed to be a native of Eastern Asia. It likewise\r\n  yields one-third more sugar on the same area than the _Caña criolla_,\r\n  which is thinner in its stalk, and more crowded with joints. As,\r\n  moreover, the West Indian Islands are beginning to suffer great\r\n  scarcity of fuel (on the island of Cuba the sugar-pans are heated with\r\n  orange-wood), the new plant acquires additional value from the fact of\r\n  its yielding a thicker and more ligneous cane (_bagaso_). If the\r\n  introduction of this new product had not been nearly simultaneous with\r\n  the outbreak of the sanguinary Negro war in St. Domingo, the prices of\r\n  sugar in Europe would have risen even higher than they did, owing to\r\n  the interruption occasioned to agriculture and trade. The important\r\n  question which here arises, whether the sugar-cane of Otaheiti, when\r\n  removed from its indigenous soil, will not gradually degenerate and\r\n  merge into the common sugar-cane, has been decided in the negative,\r\n  from the experience hitherto obtained on this subject. In the island\r\n  of Cuba a _caballeria_, that is to say, an area of 34,969 square\r\n  toises (nearly 33 English acres), produces 870 cwt. of sugar, if it be\r\n  planted with the Tahitian sugar-cane. It is remarkable enough that\r\n  this important product of the South Sea Islands should be cultivated\r\n  precisely in that portion of the Spanish colonies which is most remote\r\n  from the South Sea. The voyage from the Peruvian shore to Otaheiti may\r\n  be made in twenty-five days, and yet, at the period of my travels in\r\n  Peru and Chili, the Tahitian sugar-cane was not yet known in those\r\n  provinces. The natives of Easter Island, who suffer great distress\r\n  from want of fresh water, drink the juice of the sugar-cane, and, what\r\n  is very remarkable in a physiological point of view, likewise\r\n  sea-water. On the Society, Friendly, and Sandwich Islands, the light\r\n  green and thick stemmed sugar-cane is everywhere cultivated.\r\n\r\n  In addition to the _Caña de Otaheiti_ and the _Caña criolla_, a\r\n  reddish African sugar-cane is cultivated in the West Indies, which is\r\n  known as the _Caña de Guinea_. It is less succulent than the common\r\n  Asiatic variety, but its juice is esteemed especially well adapted for\r\n  the preparation of rum.\r\n\r\n  In the province of Caracas the light green of the Tahitian sugar-cane\r\n  forms a beautiful contrast with the dark shade of the cacao\r\n  plantations. Few tropical trees have so thick a foliage as the\r\n  _Theobroma Cacao_. This noble tree thrives best in hot and humid\r\n  valleys. Extreme fertility of soil and insalubrity of atmosphere are\r\n  as inseparably connected in South America as in Southern Asia. Nay, it\r\n  has even been observed that in proportion as the cultivation of the\r\n  land increases, and the woods are removed, the soil and the climate\r\n  become less humid, and the cacao plantations thrive less luxuriantly.\r\n  But while they diminish in numbers in the province of Caracas, they\r\n  spread rapidly in the eastern provinces of New Barcelona and Cumana,\r\n  more especially in the humid woody region lying between Cariaco and\r\n  the Golfo Triste.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  p. 1—“_The natives term this phenomenon ‘banks.’_”\r\n\r\n  The Llanos of Caracas are covered with a widely-extended formation of\r\n  ancient conglomerate. On passing from the valleys of Aragua over the\r\n  most southern range of the coast chain of Guigue and Villa de Cura,\r\n  descending towards Parapara, the traveller meets successively with\r\n  strata of gneiss and micaceous schist, a probably _Silurian_\r\n  transition rock of argillaceous schist and black limestone; serpentine\r\n  and greenstone in detached spheroidal masses; and lastly, on the\r\n  margin of the great plain, small elevations of augitic amygdaloid and\r\n  porphyritic schist. These hills between Parapara and Ortiz appear to\r\n  me to be produced by volcanic eruptions on the old sea-shore of the\r\n  Llanos. Further to the north, rise the far-famed cavernous and\r\n  grotesquely-shaped elevations known as the Morros de San Juan, which\r\n  form a species of devil’s dyke, the grain of which is crystalline,\r\n  like upheaved dolomite. They are, therefore, to be regarded rather as\r\n  portions of the shore than as islands in the ancient gulf. I consider\r\n  the Llanos to have been a gulf, for when their inconsiderable\r\n  elevation above the present sea level, the adaptation of their form to\r\n  the rotation current, running from east to west, and the lowness of\r\n  the eastern shore between the mouth of the Orinoco and the Essequibo\r\n  are taken into account, it can scarcely be doubted that the sea once\r\n  overflowed the whole of this basin between the coast chain and the\r\n  Sierra de la Parime, extending westward to the mountains of Merida and\r\n  Pamplona (in the same manner as it probably passed through the plains\r\n  of Lombardy to the Cottian and Pennine Alps). Moreover, the\r\n  inclination or line of strike of these Llanos is directed from west to\r\n  east. Their elevation at Calabozo, a distance of 100 geographical (400\r\n  English) miles from the sea, scarcely amounts to 30 toises, or 192\r\n  English feet; consequently 15 toises (96 English feet) less than the\r\n  elevation of Pavia, and 45 toises (288 English feet) less than that of\r\n  Milan in the plain of Lombardy between the Swiss Lepontine Alps and\r\n  the Ligurian Apennines. This conformation of the land reminds us of\r\n  Claudian’s expression, “curvata tumore parvo planities.” The surface\r\n  of the Llanos is so perfectly horizontal that in many parts over an\r\n  area of some 480 English square miles, not a single point appears\r\n  elevated one foot above the surrounding level. When it is further\r\n  borne in mind that there is a total absence of all shrubs, and that in\r\n  some parts, as in the Mesa de Pavones, there is not even a solitary\r\n  palm-tree to be seen, it may easily be supposed that this sea-like and\r\n  dreary plain presents a most singular aspect. Far as the eye can\r\n  range, it scarcely rests on any object elevated many inches above the\r\n  general level. If the boundary of the horizon did not continually\r\n  present an undefined flickering and undulating outline, owing to the\r\n  condition of the lower strata of air, and the refraction of light,\r\n  solar elevations might be determined by the sextant above the margin\r\n  of the plain as above the horizon of the sea. This perfect flatness of\r\n  the ancient sea-bottom renders the _banks_ even more striking. They\r\n  are composed of broken floetz-strata, which rise abruptly about two or\r\n  three feet above the surrounding level, and extend uniformly over a\r\n  length of from 10 to 12 geographical (_i.e._, 40 to 48 English) miles.\r\n  It is here that the small rivers of the Steppe take their origin.\r\n\r\n  On our return from the Rio Negro, we frequently met with traces of\r\n  landslips in passing over the Llanos of Barcelona. We here found in\r\n  the place of elevated banks, isolated strata of gypsum lying from 3 to\r\n  4 toises, or 19 to 25 English feet, below the contiguous rock. Further\r\n  westward, near the confluence of the River Caura and the Orinoco, a\r\n  large tract of thickly grown forest land to the east of the Mission of\r\n  San Pedro de Alcantara, fell in after an earthquake in the year 1790.\r\n  A lake was immediately formed in the plain, which measured upwards of\r\n  300 toises (1919 feet) in diameter. The lofty trees, as the\r\n  Desmanthus, Hymenæa, and Malpighia, retained their verdure and foliage\r\n  for a long time after their submersion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  p. 2—“_A shoreless ocean seems spread before us_.”\r\n\r\n  The distant aspect of the Steppe is the more striking when the\r\n  traveller emerges from dense forests, where his eye has been\r\n  familiarised to a limited prospect and luxuriant natural scenery. I\r\n  shall ever retain an indelible impression of the effect produced on my\r\n  mind by the Llanos, when, on our return from the Upper Orinoco, they\r\n  first broke on our view from a distant mountain, opposite the mouth of\r\n  the Rio Apure, near the Hato del Capuchino. The last rays of the\r\n  setting sun illumined the Steppe, which seemed to swell before us like\r\n  some vast hemisphere, while the rising stars were refracted by the\r\n  lower stratum of the atmosphere. When the plain has been excessively\r\n  heated by the vertical rays of the sun, the evolution of the radiating\r\n  heat, the ascent of currents of air, and the contact of atmospheric\r\n  strata of unequal density, continue throughout the night.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  p. 2—“_The naked stony crust_.”\r\n\r\n  The deserts of Africa and Asia acquire a peculiar character from the\r\n  frequent occurrence of immense tracts of land, covered by one flat\r\n  uniform surface of naked rock. In the Scha-mo, which separates\r\n  Mongolia and the mountain chain of Ulangom and Malakha-Oola from the\r\n  north-west part of China, such rocky banks are termed _Tsy_. In the\r\n  woody plains of the Orinoco they are found to be surrounded with the\r\n  most luxuriant vegetation.[J] In the midst of these flat, tabular\r\n  masses of granite and syenite, several thousands of feet in diameter,\r\n  presenting merely a few scattered lichens, we find in the forests, or\r\n  on their margins, little islands of light soil, covered with low and\r\n  ever-flowering plants, having the appearance of small gardens. The\r\n  monks settled on the Upper Orinoco, singularly enough regard the whole\r\n  of these horizontal naked stony plains, when extending over a\r\n  considerable area, as conducive to fevers and other diseases. Many of\r\n  the villages belonging to the mission have been transferred to other\r\n  spots on account of the general prevalence of this opinion. Do these\r\n  stony flats (_laxas_) act chemically on the atmosphere or influence it\r\n  only by means of a greater radiation of heat?\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  p. 2—“_Compared with the Llanos and Pampas of South America, or even\r\n  with the Prairies on the Missouri_.”\r\n\r\n  Our physical and geognostic knowledge of the western mountain region\r\n  of North America has recently been enriched by the acquisition of many\r\n  accurate data yielded by the admirable labours of the enterprising\r\n  traveller Major Long, and his companion Edwin James, but more\r\n  especially by the comprehensive investigations of Captain Frémont. The\r\n  knowledge thus established clearly corroborates the accuracy of the\r\n  different facts which in my work on New Spain I could merely advance\r\n  as hypothetical conjectures regarding the northern plains and\r\n  mountains of America. In natural history, as well as in historical\r\n  research, facts remain isolated until by long-continued investigation\r\n  they are brought into connection with each other.\r\n\r\n  The eastern shore of the United States of North America inclines from\r\n  south-west to north-east, as does the Brazilian coast south of the\r\n  equator from the Rio de la Plata to Olinda. On both these regions\r\n  there rise, at a short distance from the coast line, two ranges of\r\n  mountains more nearly parallel to each other than to the western\r\n  Andes, (the Cordilleras of Chili and Peru), or to the North Mexican\r\n  chain of the Rocky Mountains. The South American or Brazilian mountain\r\n  system, forms an isolated group, the highest points of which,\r\n  Itacolumi and Itambe, do not rise above an elevation of 900 toises, or\r\n  5755 English feet. The eastern portion of the ridge most contiguous to\r\n  the sea is the only part that follows a regular inclination from\r\n  S.S.W. to N.N.E., increasing in breadth and diminishing in general\r\n  elevation as it approaches further westward. The chain of the Parecis\r\n  hills approximates to the rivers Itenes and Guaporé, in the same\r\n  manner as the mountains of Aguapehi and San Fernando (south of\r\n  Villabella) approach the lofty Andes of Cochabamba and Santa Cruz de\r\n  la Sierra.\r\n\r\n  There is no direct connection between the two mountain systems of the\r\n  Atlantic and South-sea coasts (the Brazilian and the Peruvian\r\n  Cordilleras); Western Brazil being separated from Eastern or Upper\r\n  Peru by the low lands of the province of Chiquitos, which is a\r\n  longitudinal valley that inclines from north to south, and\r\n  communicates both with the plains of the Amazon and of the Rio de la\r\n  Plata. In these regions, as in Poland and Russia, a ridge of land,\r\n  sometimes imperceptible (termed in Slavonic _Uwaly_), forms the line\r\n  of separation between different rivers; as for instance, between the\r\n  Pilcomayo and Madeira, between the Aguapehi and Guaporé, and between\r\n  the Paraguay and the Rio Topayos. The ridge (_seuil_) extends from\r\n  Chayanta and Pomabamba (19°–20° lat.,) in a south-easterly direction,\r\n  and after intersecting the depressed tracts of the province of\r\n  Chiquitos, (which has become almost unknown to geographers since the\r\n  expulsion of the Jesuits,) forms to the north-east, where some\r\n  scattered mountains are again to be met with, the _divortia aquarum_\r\n  at the sources of the Baures and near Villabella (15°–17° lat.)\r\n\r\n  This water-line of separation which is so important to the general\r\n  intercourse and growing civilization of different nations corresponds\r\n  in the northern hemisphere of South America with a second line of\r\n  demarcation (2°–3° lat.) which separates the district of the Orinoco\r\n  from that of the Rio Negro and the Amazon. These elevations or risings\r\n  in the midst of the plains (_terræ tumores_, according to Frontinus)\r\n  may almost be regarded as undeveloped mountain-systems, designed to\r\n  connect two apparently isolated groups, the Sierra Parime and the\r\n  Brazilian highlands, to the Andes chain of Timana and Cochabamba.\r\n  These relations, to which very little attention has hitherto been\r\n  directed, form the basis of my division of South America into three\r\n  depressions or basins, viz., those of the Orinoco in its lower course,\r\n  of the Amazon, and of the Rio de la Plata. Of these three basins, the\r\n  exterior ones, as I have already observed, are Steppes or Prairies;\r\n  but the central one between the Sierra Parime and the Brazilian chain\r\n  of mountains must be regarded as a wooded plain or _Hylæa_.\r\n\r\n  In endeavouring by a few equally brief touches to give a sketch of the\r\n  natural features of North America, we must first glance at the chain\r\n  of the Andes, which, narrow at its origin, soon increases in height\r\n  and breadth as it follows an inclination from south-east to\r\n  north-west, passing through Panama, Veragua, Guatimala, and New Spain.\r\n  This range of mountains, formerly the seat of an ancient civilization,\r\n  presents a like barrier to the general current of the sea between the\r\n  tropics, and to a more rapid intercommunication between Europe,\r\n  Western Africa, and Eastern Asia. From the 17th degree of latitude at\r\n  the celebrated Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the chain deflects from the\r\n  shores of the Pacific, and inclining from south to north becomes an\r\n  inland Cordillera. In Northern Mexico, the Crane Mountains (Sierra de\r\n  las Grullas) constitute a portion of the Rocky Mountains. On their\r\n  western declivity rise the Columbia and the Rio Colorado of\r\n  California; on the eastern side the Rio Roxo of Natchitoches, the\r\n  Canadian river, the Arkansas, and the shallow river Platte, which\r\n  latter has recently been converted by some ignorant geographers, into\r\n  a Rio _de la Plata_, or a river yielding silver. Between the sources\r\n  of these rivers rise in the parallels of 37° 20′ and 40° 13′ lat.,\r\n  three huge peaks composed of granite, containing little mica, but a\r\n  large proportion of hornblende. These have been respectively named\r\n  Spanish Peak, James or Pike’s Peak, and Big Horn or Long’s Peak.[K]\r\n  Their elevation exceeds that of the highest summits of the North\r\n  Mexican Andes, which indeed nowhere attain the height of the line of\r\n  perpetual snow from the parallels of 18° and 19° lat., or from the\r\n  group of Orizaba, (2717 toises, or 17,374 English feet), and of\r\n  Popocatepetl (2771 toises, or 17,720 English feet) to Santa Fé and\r\n  Taos in New Mexico. James’ Peak (38° 48′ lat.) is said to have an\r\n  elevation of 11,497 English feet. Of this only 8537 feet have been\r\n  determined by trigonometrical measurement, the remainder being deduced\r\n  in the absence of barometrical observations, from uncertain\r\n  calculations of the declivity or fall of rivers. As it is scarcely\r\n  ever possible, even at the level of the sea, to conduct a purely\r\n  trigonometrical measurement, determinations of impracticable heights\r\n  are always in part barometrical. Measurements of the fall of rivers,\r\n  of their rapidity and of the length of their course, are so deceptive,\r\n  that the plain at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, more especially\r\n  near those summits mentioned in the text, was, before the important\r\n  expedition of Captain Frémont, estimated sometimes at 8000 and\r\n  sometimes at 3000 feet above the level of the sea.[L] From a similar\r\n  deficiency of barometrical measurements, the true height of the\r\n  Himalaya remained for a long time uncertain; now, however, science has\r\n  made such advances in India, that when Captain Gerard had ascended on\r\n  the Tarhigang, near the Sutledge, north of Shipke, to the height of\r\n  19,411 feet, he still had, after having broken three barometers, four\r\n  equally correct ones remaining.[M]\r\n\r\n  Frémont, in the expedition which he made between the years 1842 and\r\n  1844, at the command of the United States Government, discovered and\r\n  measured barometrically the highest peak of the whole chain of the\r\n  Rocky Mountains to the north-north-west of Spanish, James’, Long’s,\r\n  and Laramie’s Peaks. This snow-covered summit, which belongs to the\r\n  group of the Wind River Mountains, bears the name of Frémont’s Peak on\r\n  the great chart published under the direction of Colonel Abert, chief\r\n  of the topographical department at Washington. This point is situated\r\n  in the parallel of 43° 10′ north lat., and 110° 7′ west long., and\r\n  therefore nearly 5° 30′ north of Spanish Peak. The elevation of\r\n  Frémont’s Peak, which according to direct measurement is 13,568 feet,\r\n  must therefore exceed by 2072 feet that given by Long to James’ Peak,\r\n  which would appear from its position to be identical with Pike’s Peak,\r\n  as given in the map above referred to. The Wind River Mountains\r\n  constitute the dividing ridge (_divortia aquarum_) between the two\r\n  seas. “From the summit,” says Captain Frémont in his official\r\n  report,[N] “we saw on the one side numerous lakes and streams, the\r\n  sources of the Rio Colorado, which carries its waters through the\r\n  Californian Gulf to the South Sea; on the other, the deep valley of\r\n  the Wind River, where lie the sources of the Yellowstone River, one of\r\n  the main branches of the Missouri which unites with the Mississippi at\r\n  St. Louis. Far to the north-west we could just discover the snowy\r\n  heads of the Trois Tetons, which give rise to the true sources of the\r\n  Missouri not far from the primitive stream of the Oregon or Columbia\r\n  river, which is known under the name of Snake River, or Lewis Fork.”\r\n\r\n  To the surprise of the adventurous travellers, the summit of Frémont’s\r\n  Peak was found to be visited by bees. It is probable that these\r\n  insects, like the butterflies which I found at far higher elevations\r\n  in the chain of the Andes, and also within the limits of perpetual\r\n  snow, had been involuntarily drawn thither by ascending currents of\r\n  air. I have even seen large winged lepidoptera, which had been carried\r\n  far out to sea by land-winds, drop on the ship deck at a considerable\r\n  distance from land in the South Sea.\r\n\r\n  Frémont’s map and geographical researches embrace the immense tract of\r\n  land extending from the confluence of Kanzas River with the Missouri,\r\n  to the cataracts of the Columbia and the Missions of Santa Barbara and\r\n  Pueblo de los Angeles in New California, presenting a space amounting\r\n  to 28 degrees of longitude (about 1360 miles) between the 34th and\r\n  45th parallels of north latitude. Four hundred points have been\r\n  hypsometrically determined by barometrical measurements, and for the\r\n  most part, astronomically: so that it has been rendered possible to\r\n  delineate the profile above the sea’s level of a tract of land\r\n  measuring 3,600 miles with all its inflections, extending from the\r\n  north of Kanzas River to Fort Vancouver and to the coasts of the South\r\n  Sea (almost 720 miles more than the distance from Madrid to Tobolsk).\r\n  As I believe I was the first who attempted to represent, in geognostic\r\n  profile, the configuration of entire countries, as the Spanish\r\n  Peninsula, the highland of Mexico, and the Cordilleras of South\r\n  America (for the half-perspective projections of the Siberian\r\n  traveller, the Abbé Chappe,[O] were based on mere and for the most\r\n  part on very inaccurate estimates of the falls of rivers); it has\r\n  afforded me special satisfaction to find the graphical method of\r\n  representing the earth’s configuration in a vertical direction, that\r\n  is, the elevation of solid over fluid parts, achieved on so vast a\r\n  scale. In the mean latitudes of 37° to 43° the Rocky Mountains\r\n  present, besides the great snow-crowned summits, whose height may be\r\n  compared to that of the Peak of Teneriffe, elevated plateaux of an\r\n  extent scarcely to be met with in any other part of the world, and\r\n  whose breadth from east to west is almost twice that of the Mexican\r\n  highlands. From the range of the mountains, which begin a little\r\n  westward of Fort Laramie, to the further side of the Wahsatch\r\n  Mountains, the elevation of the soil is uninterruptedly maintained\r\n  from five to upwards of seven thousand feet above the sea’s level;\r\n  nay, this elevated portion occupies the whole space between the true\r\n  Rocky Mountains and the Californian snowy coast range from 34° to 45°\r\n  north latitude. This district, which is a kind of broad longitudinal\r\n  valley, like that of the lake of Titicaca, has been named _The Great\r\n  Basin_ by Joseph Walker and Captain Frémont, travellers well\r\n  acquainted with these western regions. It is a _terra incognita_ of at\r\n  least 8000 geographical (or 128,000 English) square miles, arid,\r\n  almost uninhabited, and full of salt lakes, the largest of which is\r\n  3940 Parisian (or 4200 English) feet above the level of the sea, and\r\n  is connected with the narrow Lake Utah,[P] into which the “Rock River”\r\n  (_Timpan Ogo_ in the Utah language) pours its copious stream. Father\r\n  Escalante, in his wanderings from Santa Fé del Nuevo Mexico to\r\n  Monterey in New California, discovered Frémont’s “Great Salt Lake” in\r\n  1776, and confounding together the river and the lake, called it\r\n  Laguna de Timpanogo. Under this name I inserted it in my map of\r\n  Mexico, which gave rise to much uncritical discussion regarding the\r\n  assumed non-existence of a large inland salt lake,[Q]—a question\r\n  previously mooted by the learned American traveller Tanner. Gallatin\r\n  expressly says in his memoir on the aboriginal races[R]—“General\r\n  Ashley and Mr. J. S. Smith have found the Lake Timpanogo in the same\r\n  latitude and longitude nearly as had been assigned to it in Humboldt’s\r\n  Atlas of Mexico.”\r\n\r\n  I have purposely dwelt at length on these considerations regarding the\r\n  remarkable elevation of the soil in the region of the Rocky Mountains,\r\n  since by its extension and height it undoubtedly exercises a great,\r\n  although hitherto unappreciated influence on the climate of the\r\n  northern half of the new continent, both in its southern and eastern\r\n  portions. On this vast and uniformly elevated plateau Frémont found\r\n  the water covered with ice every night in the month of August. Nor is\r\n  the configuration of the land less important when considered in\r\n  reference to the social condition and progress of the great North\r\n  American United States. Although the mountain range which divides the\r\n  waters attains a height nearly equal to that of the passes of Mount\r\n  Simplon (6170 Parisian or 6576 English feet), Mount Gothard (6440\r\n  Parisian or 6863 English feet), and the great St. Bernard (7476\r\n  Parisian or 7957 English feet), the ascent is so prolonged and gradual\r\n  that no impediments oppose a general intercourse by means of vehicles\r\n  and carriages of every kind between the Missouri and Oregon\r\n  territories, between the Atlantic States, and the new settlements on\r\n  the Oregon (or Columbia) river, or between the coast-lands lying\r\n  opposite to Europe on the one side of the continent, and to China on\r\n  the other. The distance from Boston to the old settlement of Astoria\r\n  on the Pacific at the mouth of the Oregon when measured in a direct\r\n  line, and taking into account the difference of longitude, is 550\r\n  geographical, _i.e._, 2200 English miles, or one-sixth less than the\r\n  distance between Lisbon and Katherinenburg in the Ural district. On\r\n  account of this gentle ascent of the elevated plains leading from the\r\n  Missouri to California and the Oregon territory (all the\r\n  resting-places measured between the Fort and River Lamarie on the\r\n  northern branch of the Platte river to Fort Hall on the Lewis Fork of\r\n  the Columbia, being situated at an elevation of from five to upwards\r\n  of seven thousand feet, and that in Old Park even at the height of\r\n  9760 Parisian or 10,402 English feet!), considerable difficulty has\r\n  been experienced in determining the culminating point, or that of the\r\n  _divortia aquarum_. It is south of the Wind River Mountains, about\r\n  midway between the Mississippi and the coast line of the Southern\r\n  Ocean, and is situated at an elevation of 7490 feet, or only 480 feet\r\n  lower than the pass of the Great Bernard. The emigrants call this\r\n  culminating point the South Pass.[S] It is situated in a pleasant\r\n  region, embellished by a profusion of artemisiæ, especially A.\r\n  tridentata (Nuttall), and varieties of asters and cactuses, which\r\n  cover the micaceous slate and gneiss rocks. Astronomical\r\n  determinations place its latitude in the parallel of 42° 24′, and its\r\n  longitude in that of 109° 24′ W. Adolf Erman has already drawn\r\n  attention to the fact, that the line of strike of the great\r\n  east-Asiatic Aldanian mountain-chain, which separates the basin of the\r\n  Lena from the rivers flowing towards the Great Southern Ocean, if\r\n  extended in the form of a great circle on the surface of the globe,\r\n  passes through many of the summits of the Rocky Mountains between 40°\r\n  and 55° north lat. “An American and an Asiatic mountain-chain,” he\r\n  remarks, “appear therefore to be only portions of one and the same\r\n  fissure erupted by the shortest channels.”[T]\r\n\r\n  The western high mountain coast chain of the Californian maritime\r\n  Alps, the _Sierra Nevada de California_, is wholly distinct from the\r\n  Rocky Mountains, which sink towards the Mackenzie River (that remains\r\n  covered with ice for a great portion of the year), and from the high\r\n  table land on which rise individual snow-covered peaks. However\r\n  injudicious the choice of the appellation of _Rocky Mountains_ may be,\r\n  when applied to the most northerly prolongation of the Mexican central\r\n  chain, I do not deem it expedient to substitute for it the\r\n  denomination of the Oregon Chain, as has frequently been attempted.\r\n  These mountains do indeed give rise to the sources of three main\r\n  branches constituting the great Oregon or Columbia river (viz.,\r\n  Lewis’, Clarke’s, and North Fork); but this mighty stream also\r\n  intersects the chain of the ever snow-crowned maritime Alps of\r\n  California. The name of Oregon Territory is also employed, politically\r\n  and officially, to designate the lesser territory of land west of the\r\n  coast chain, where Fort Vancouver and the Walahmutti settlements are\r\n  situated; and it would therefore seem better to abstain from applying\r\n  the name of Oregon either to the central or to the coast chain. This\r\n  denomination, moreover, led the celebrated geographer Malte-Brun into\r\n  a misconception of the most remarkable kind. He read in an old Spanish\r\n  chart the following passage:—“And it is still unknown (_y aun se\r\n  ignora_) where the source of this river” (now called the Columbia) “is\r\n  situated,” and he believed that the word _ignora_ signified the name\r\n  of the Oregon.[U]\r\n\r\n  The rocks which give rise to the cataracts of the Columbia at the\r\n  point where the river breaks through the chain, mark the prolongation\r\n  of the Sierra Nevada of California from the 44th to the 47th degree of\r\n  latitude.[V] In this northern prolongation of the chain lie the three\r\n  colossal elevations of Mount Jefferson, Mount Hood, and Mount St.\r\n  Helen’s, which rise 14,540 Parisian (or 15,500 English) feet above the\r\n  sea-level. The height of this coast chain or range far exceeds\r\n  therefore that of the Rocky Mountains. “During an eight months’\r\n  journey along these maritime Alps,” says Captain Frémont,[W] “we were\r\n  constantly within sight of snow-covered summits; and while we were\r\n  able to cross the Rocky Mountains through the South Pass at an\r\n  elevation of 7027 feet, we found that the passes in the maritime\r\n  range, which is divided into several parallel chains, were more than\r\n  2000 feet higher”—and therefore only 1170 (English) feet below the\r\n  summit of Mount Etna. It is also a very remarkable fact, and one which\r\n  reminds us of the relations of the eastern and western Cordilleras of\r\n  Chili, that volcanoes still active are only found in the Californian\r\n  chain which lies in the closest proximity to the sea. The conical\r\n  mountains of Regnier and of St. Helen’s are almost invariably observed\r\n  to emit smoke; and on the 23rd of November, 1843, the latter of these\r\n  volcanoes erupted a mass of ashes which covered the shores of the\r\n  Columbia for a distance of forty miles, like a fall of snow. To the\r\n  volcanic Californian chain belong also in the far north of Russian\r\n  America, Mount Elias (according to La Pérouse 1980 toises, or 12,660\r\n  feet, and according to Malaspina 2792 toises, or 17,850 feet in\r\n  height), and Mount Fair Weather (Cerro de Buen Tiempo, 2304 toises, or\r\n  14,733 feet high). Both these conical mountains are regarded as still\r\n  active volcanoes. Frémont’s expedition, which has proved alike useful\r\n  in reference to botany and geognosy, likewise collected volcanic\r\n  products in the Rocky Mountains (as scoriaceous basalt, trachyte, and\r\n  true obsidian), and discovered an old extinct crater somewhat to the\r\n  east of Fort Hall (43° 2′ north lat., and 112° 28′ west long.), but no\r\n  traces of any still active volcanoes emitting lava and ashes, were to\r\n  be met with. We must not confound with these the hitherto unexplained\r\n  phenomenon termed _smoking hills_, _côtes brûlées_, and _terrains\r\n  ardens_, in the language of the English settlers and the natives who\r\n  speak French. “Rows of low conical hills,” says the accurate observer\r\n  M. Nicollet, “are almost periodically, and sometimes for two or three\r\n  years continually, covered with dense black smoke, unaccompanied by\r\n  any visible flames. This phenomenon is more particularly noticed in\r\n  the territory of the Upper Missouri, and still nearer to the eastern\r\n  declivity of the Rocky Mountains, where there is a river named by the\r\n  natives Mankizitah-watpa, or the river of smoking earth. Scorified\r\n  pseudo-volcanic products, a kind of porcelain jasper, are found in the\r\n  vicinity of the smoking hills.”\r\n\r\n  Since the expedition of Lewis and Clarke an opinion has generally\r\n  prevailed that the Missouri deposits a true pumice on its banks; but\r\n  here white masses of a delicate cellular texture have been mistaken\r\n  for that substance. Professor Ducatel was of opinion that the\r\n  phenomenon which is chiefly observed in the chalk formation, was owing\r\n  to “the decomposition of water by sulphur pyrites and to a reaction on\r\n  the brown coal floetzes.”[X]\r\n\r\n  If before we close these general remarks regarding the configuration\r\n  of North America we once more cast a glance at those regions which\r\n  separate the two diverging coast chains from the central chain, we\r\n  shall find in strong contrast, on the West, between that central chain\r\n  and the Californian Alps of the Pacific, an arid and uninhabited\r\n  elevated plateau nearly six thousand feet above the sea; and in the\r\n  East, between the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. (whose highest\r\n  points, Mount Washington and Mount Marcy, rise, according to Lyell, to\r\n  the respective heights, of 6652 and 5400 feet,) we see the richly\r\n  watered, fruitful, and thickly-inhabited basin of the Mississippi, at\r\n  an elevation of from four to six hundred feet, or more than twice that\r\n  of the plains of Lombardy. The hypsometrical character of this eastern\r\n  valley, or in other words, its relation to the sea’s level, has only\r\n  very recently been explained by the admirable labours of the talented\r\n  French astronomer Nicollet, unhappily lost to science by a premature\r\n  death. His great chart of the Upper Mississippi, executed between the\r\n  years 1836 and 1840, was based on two hundred and forty astronomical\r\n  determinations of latitude, and one hundred and seventy barometrical\r\n  determinations of elevation. The plain which encloses the valley of\r\n  the Mississippi is identical with that of northern Canada, and forms\r\n  part of one and the same depressed basin, extending from the Gulf of\r\n  Mexico to the Arctic Sea.[Y] Wherever the low land falls in\r\n  undulations, and slight elevations which still retain their un-English\r\n  appellation of _côteaux des prairies_, _côteaux des bois_, occur in\r\n  connected rows between the parallels of 47° and 48° north lat., these\r\n  rows and gentle undulations of the ground separate the waters between\r\n  Hudson’s Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Such a line of separation between\r\n  the waters is formed, north of Lake Superior or Kichi Gummi, by the\r\n  Missabay Heights, and further west by the elevations known as\r\n  _Hauteurs des Terres_, in which are situated the true sources of the\r\n  Mississippi, one of the largest rivers in the world, and which were\r\n  not discovered till the year 1832. The highest of these chains of\r\n  hills hardly attains an elevation of from 1500 to 1600 feet. From its\r\n  mouth (the old French Balize) to St. Louis, somewhat to the south of\r\n  its confluence with the Missouri, the Mississippi has a fall of only\r\n  380 feet, notwithstanding that the itinerary distance between these\r\n  two points exceeds 1280 miles. The surface of Lake Superior lies at an\r\n  elevation of 618 feet, and as its depth in the neighbourhood of the\r\n  island of Magdalena is fully 790 feet, its bottom must be 172 feet\r\n  below the surface of the ocean.[Z]\r\n\r\n  Beltrami, who in 1825 separated himself from Major Long’s expedition,\r\n  boasted that he had found the sources of the Mississippi in Lake Cass.\r\n  The river passes, in its upper course, through four lakes, the second\r\n  of which is the one referred to, while the outermost one, Lake Istaca\r\n  (47° 13′ north lat., and 95° west long.), was first recognised as the\r\n  true source of the Mississippi, in 1832, in the expedition of\r\n  Schoolcraft and Lieutenant Allen. This stream, which subsequently\r\n  becomes so mighty, is only 17 feet in width, and 15 inches deep, when\r\n  it issues from the singular horse-shoe-shaped Lake Istaca. The local\r\n  relations of this river were first fully established on a basis of\r\n  astronomical observations of position by the scientific expedition of\r\n  Nicollet, in the year 1836. The height of the sources, that is to say,\r\n  of the last access of water received by Lake Istaca from the ridge of\r\n  separation, called _Hauteur de Terre_, is 1680 feet above the level of\r\n  the sea. Near this point, and at the southern declivity of the same\r\n  separating ridge, lies Elbow Lake, the source of the small Red River\r\n  of the north, which empties itself, after many windings, into Hudson’s\r\n  Bay. The Carpathian Mountains exhibit similar relations in reference\r\n  to the origin of the rivers which empty themselves into the Baltic and\r\n  the Black Sea. M. Nicollet gave the names of celebrated astronomers,\r\n  opponents as well as friends, with whom he had become acquainted in\r\n  Europe, to the twenty small lakes which combine together to form\r\n  narrow groups in the southern and western regions of Lake Istaca. His\r\n  atlas is thus converted into a geographical album, reminding one of\r\n  the botanical album of the _Flora Peruviana_ of Ruiz and Pavon, in\r\n  which the names of new families of plants were made to accord with the\r\n  Court Calendar, and the various alterations made in the _Oficiales de\r\n  la Secretaria_.\r\n\r\n  The east of the Mississippi is still occupied by dense forests; the\r\n  west by prairies only, on which the buffalo (_Bos Americanus_) and the\r\n  musk ox (_Bos moschatus_) pasture. These two species of animals, the\r\n  largest of the new world, furnish the nomadic tribes of the\r\n  Apaches-Llaneros and Apaches-Lipanos with the means of nourishment.\r\n  The Assiniboins occasionally slay from seven to eight hundred bisons\r\n  in the course of a few days in the artificial enclosures constructed\r\n  for the purpose of driving together the wild herds, and known as\r\n  _bison parks_.[AA] The American bison, called by the Mexicans\r\n  _Cibolo_, is killed chiefly on account of the tongue, which is\r\n  regarded as a special delicacy. This animal is not a mere variety of\r\n  the aurochs of the old world; although, like other species of animals,\r\n  as for instance the elk (_Cervus alces_) and the reindeer (_Cervus\r\n  tarandus_), no less than the stunted inhabitants of the polar regions,\r\n  it may be regarded as common to the northern portions of _all_\r\n  continents, and as affording a proof of their former long existing\r\n  connection. The Mexicans apply to the European ox the Aztec term\r\n  _quaquahue_, or horned animal, from _quaquahuitl_, a horn. The huge\r\n  ox-horns which have been found in ancient Mexican buildings near\r\n  Cuernavaca, south-west of the capital of Mexico, appear to me to\r\n  belong to the bison. The Canadian bison can be used for agricultural\r\n  labour, and will breed with the European cattle, although it is\r\n  uncertain whether the hybrid thus engendered is capable of propagating\r\n  its species. Albert Gallatin, who, before his appearance in Europe as\r\n  a distinguished diplomatist, had acquired by personal observation a\r\n  considerable amount of information regarding the uncultivated parts of\r\n  the United States, assures us that the fruitfulness of the mixed breed\r\n  of the American buffalo and European cattle is an undoubted fact: “the\r\n  mixed breed,” he writes, “was quite common fifty years ago in some of\r\n  the north-western counties of Virginia, and the cows, the issue of\r\n  that mixture, propagated like all others.” “I do not remember,” he\r\n  further adds, “that full-grown buffaloes were tamed; but dogs would at\r\n  that time occasionally bring in the young bison-calves, which were\r\n  reared and bred with European cows. At Monongahela all the cattle for\r\n  a long time were of this mixed breed. It was said, however, that the\r\n  cows yielded but little milk.” The favourite food of the buffalo is\r\n  the _Tripsacum dactyloides_ (known as buffalo-grass in North Carolina)\r\n  and a hitherto undescribed species of clover allied to the _Trifolium\r\n  repens_, and designated by Barton as _Trifolium bisonicum_.\r\n\r\n  I have elsewhere[AB] drawn attention to the fact, that according to a\r\n  passage of the trustworthy Gomara[AC], there lived, as late as the\r\n  sixteenth century, an Indian tribe in the north-west of Mexico, in 40°\r\n  north lat., whose greatest wealth consisted in hordes of tamed\r\n  buffaloes (_bueyes con una giba_). Yet, notwithstanding the\r\n  possibility of taming the buffalo, and the abundance of milk it\r\n  yields, and notwithstanding the herds of Lamas in the Peruvian\r\n  Cordilleras, no pastoral tribes were met with on the discovery of\r\n  America. Nor does history afford any evidence of the existence, at any\r\n  period, of this intermediate stage of national development. It is also\r\n  a remarkable fact that the North American bison or buffalo has exerted\r\n  an influence on geographical discoveries in pathless mountain\r\n  districts. These animals advance in herds of many thousands in search\r\n  of a milder climate, during winter, in the countries south of the\r\n  Arkansas river. Their size and cumbrous forms render it difficult for\r\n  them to cross high mountains on these migratory courses, and a\r\n  well-trodden buffalo-path is therefore followed wherever it is met\r\n  with, as it invariably indicates the most convenient passage across\r\n  the mountains. Thus buffalo-paths have indicated the best tracks for\r\n  passing over the Cumberland Mountains in the south-western parts of\r\n  Virginia and Kentucky, and over the Rocky Mountains, between the\r\n  sources of the Yellowstone and Plate rivers, and between the southern\r\n  branch of the Columbia and the Californian Rio Colorado. European\r\n  settlements have gradually driven the buffalo from the eastern\r\n  portions of the United States. Formerly these migratory animals passed\r\n  the banks of the Mississippi and the Ohio, advancing far beyond\r\n  Pittsburgh.[AD]\r\n\r\n  From the granitic rocks of Diego Ramirez and the deeply-intersected\r\n  district of Terra del Fuego (which in the east contains silurian\r\n  schist, and in the west, the same schist metamorphosed into granite by\r\n  the action of subterranean fire,)[AE] to the North Polar Sea, the\r\n  Cordilleras extend over a distance of more than 8000 miles. Although\r\n  not the loftiest, they are the longest mountain chain in the world,\r\n  being upheaved from one fissure, which runs in the direction of a\r\n  meridian from pole to pole, and exceeding in linear extent the\r\n  distance which, in the old continent, separates the Pillars of\r\n  Hercules from the Icy Cape of the Tschuktches, in the north-east of\r\n  Asia. Where the Andes are divided into several parallel chains, those\r\n  lying nearest the sea are found to be the seat of the most active\r\n  volcanoes; and it has moreover been repeatedly observed that when the\r\n  phenomenon of an eruption of subterranean fire ceases in one mountain\r\n  chain, it breaks forth in some other parallel range. The cones of\r\n  eruption usually follow the direction of the axis of the chain; but in\r\n  the Mexican table-land, the active volcanoes are situated on a\r\n  transverse fissure, running from sea to sea, in a direction from east\r\n  and west.[AF] Wherever the upheaval of mountain masses in the folding\r\n  of the ancient crust of the earth has opened a communication with the\r\n  fused interior, volcanic activity continued to be exhibited on the\r\n  murally upheaved mass by means of the ramification of fissures. That\r\n  which we call a mountain chain has not been raised to its present\r\n  elevation, or manifested as it now appears, at one definite period;\r\n  for we find that rocks, varying considerably in age, have been\r\n  superimposed on one another, and have penetrated towards the surface\r\n  through early formed channels. The diversity observable in rocks is\r\n  owing to the outpouring and upheaval of rocks of eruption, as well as\r\n  to the complicated and slow process of metamorphism going on in\r\n  fissures filled with vapour, and conducive to the conduction of heat.\r\n\r\n  The following have for a long time, viz., from 1830 to 1848, been\r\n  regarded as the highest or culminating points of the Cordilleras of\r\n  the new continent:—\r\n\r\n  The _Nevado de Sorata_, also called Ancohuma or Tusubaya (15° 52′\r\n  south lat.), somewhat to the south of the village of Sorata or\r\n  Esquibel, in the eastern chain of Bolivia: elevation, 25,222 feet.\r\n\r\n  The _Nevado de Illimani_, west of the mission of Yrupana (16° 38′\r\n  south lat.), also in the eastern chain of Bolivia: elevation, 24,000\r\n  feet.\r\n\r\n  The _Chimborazo_ (1° 27′ south lat.), in the province of Quito:\r\n  elevation, 21,422 feet.\r\n\r\n  The Sorata and Illimani were first measured by the distinguished\r\n  geologist, Pentland, in the years 1827 and 1838; and since the\r\n  publication of his large map of the basin of the Laguna de Titicaca,\r\n  in June, 1848, we learn that the above elevations given for the Sorata\r\n  and Illimani are 3960 feet and 2851 feet too high. His map gives only\r\n  21,286 feet for the Sorata, and 21,149 feet for the Illimani. A more\r\n  exact calculation of the trigonometrical operations of 1838 led Mr.\r\n  Pentland to these new results. He ascribes an elevation of from 21,700\r\n  to 22,350 feet to four summits of the western Cordilleras; and,\r\n  according to his data, the Peak of Sahama would thus be 926 feet\r\n  higher than the Chimborazo, but 850 feet lower than the Peak of\r\n  Aconcagua.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  p. 2—“_The desert near the basaltic mountains of Harudsch_.”\r\n\r\n  Near the Egyptian Natron Lakes, which in Strabo’s time had not yet\r\n  been divided into the six reservoirs by which they are now\r\n  characterized, there rises abruptly to the north a chain of hills,\r\n  running from east to west past Fezzan, where it at length appears to\r\n  form one connected range with the Atlas chain. It divides in\r\n  north-eastern, as Mount Atlas does in north-western Africa the Lybia,\r\n  described by Herodotus as inhabited and situated near the sea, from\r\n  the land of the Berbirs, or Biledulgerid, famed for the abundance of\r\n  its wild animals. On the borders of Middle Egypt the whole region,\r\n  south of the 30th degree of latitude, is an ocean of sand, studded\r\n  here and there with islands or oases abounding in springs and rich in\r\n  vegetation. Owing to the discoveries of recent travellers, a vast\r\n  addition has been made to the number of the Oases formerly known, and\r\n  which the ancients limited to three, compared by Strabo to spots upon\r\n  a panther’s skin. The third Oasis of the ancients, now called Siwah,\r\n  was the _nomos_ of Ammon, a hierarchical seat and a resting-place for\r\n  the caravans, which inclosed within its precincts the temple of the\r\n  horned Ammon and the spring of the Sun, whose waters were supposed to\r\n  become cool at certain periods. The ruins of Ummibida (_Omm-Beydah_)\r\n  incontestably belong to the fortified caravanserai at the Temple of\r\n  Ammon, and therefore constitute one of the most ancient monuments\r\n  which have come down to us from the dawn of human civilization.[AG]\r\n\r\n  The word Oasis is Egyptian, and is synonymous with Auasis and\r\n  Hyasis.[AH] Abulfeda calls the Oases _el-Wah_. In the latter time of\r\n  the Cæsars, malefactors were sent to the Oases, being banished to\r\n  these islands in the sandy ocean, as the Spaniards and English\r\n  transported their malefactors to the Falkland islands and New Holland.\r\n  The ocean affords almost a better chance of escape than the desert\r\n  surrounding the Oases; which, moreover, diminish in fruitfulness in\r\n  proportion to the greater quantity of sand incorporated in the soil.\r\n\r\n  The small mountain range of Harudsch (_Harudje_[AI]) consists of\r\n  grotesquely-shaped basaltic hills. It is the _Mons Ater_ of Pliny, and\r\n  its western extremity, known as the Soudah mountain, has been recently\r\n  explored by my unfortunate friend, the enterprising traveller Ritchie.\r\n  These basaltic eruptions in the tertiary limestone, and rows of hills\r\n  rising abruptly from fissures, appear to be analogous to the basaltic\r\n  eruptions in the Vicentine territory.\r\n\r\n  Nature repeats the same phenomena in the most distant regions of the\r\n  earth. Hornemann found an immense quantity of petrified fishes’ heads\r\n  in the limestone formations of the White Harudsch (_Harudje\r\n  el-Abiad_), belonging probably to the old chalk. Ritchie and Lyon\r\n  remarked that the basalt of the Soudah mountain was in many places\r\n  intimately mingled with carbonate of lime, as is the case in Monte\r\n  Berico; a phenomenon that is probably connected with eruptions through\r\n  limestone strata. Lyon’s chart even indicates dolomite in the\r\n  neighbourhood. Modern mineralogists have found syenite and greenstone,\r\n  but not basalt, in Egypt. Is it possible that the true basalt, from\r\n  which many of the ancient vases found in various parts of the country\r\n  were made, can have been derived from a mountain lying so far to the\r\n  west? Can the _obsidius lapis_ have come from there, or are we to seek\r\n  basalt and obsidian on the coast of the Red Sea? The strip of the\r\n  volcanic eruptions of Harudsch, on the borders of the African desert,\r\n  moreover reminds the geologist of augitic vesicular amygdaloid,\r\n  phonolite, and greenstone porphyry, which are only found on the\r\n  northern and western limits of the steppes of Venezuela and of the\r\n  plains of the Arkansas, and therefore, as it were, on the ancient\r\n  coast chains.[AJ]\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  p. 3—“_When suddenly deserted by the tropical east wind, and the sea\r\n  is covered with weeds_.”\r\n\r\n  It is a remarkable phenomenon, although one generally known to\r\n  mariners, that in the neighbourhood of the African coast, (between the\r\n  Canaries and the Cape de Verde islands, and more especially between\r\n  Cape Bojador and the mouth of the Senegal,) a westerly wind often\r\n  prevails instead of the usual east or trade wind of the tropics. The\r\n  cause of this phenomenon is to be ascribed to the far-extending desert\r\n  of Zahara, and arises from the rarefaction, and consequent vertical\r\n  ascent of the air over the heated sandy surface. To fill up the vacuum\r\n  thus occasioned, the cool sea-air rushes in, producing a westerly\r\n  breeze, adverse to vessels sailing to America; and the mariner, long\r\n  before he perceives any continent, is made sensible of the effects of\r\n  its heat-radiating sands. As is well known, a similar cause produces\r\n  that alternation of sea and land breezes, which prevails at certain\r\n  hours of the day and night on all sea-coasts.\r\n\r\n  The accumulation of sea-weed in the neighbourhood of the western\r\n  coasts of Africa has been often referred to by ancient writers. The\r\n  local position of this accumulation is a problem which is intimately\r\n  connected with the conjectures regarding the extent of Phœnician\r\n  navigation. The Periplus, which has been ascribed to Scylax of\r\n  Caryanda, and which, according to the investigations of Niebuhr and\r\n  Letronne, was very probably compiled in the time of Philip of Macedon,\r\n  contains a description of a kind of fucus sea, _Mar de Sargasso_,\r\n  beyond Cerne; but the locality indicated appears to me very different\r\n  from that assigned to it in the work “_De Mirabilibus\r\n  Auscultationibus_,” which for a long time, but incorrectly, bore the\r\n  great name of Aristotle.[AK] “Driven by the east wind,” says the\r\n  pseudo-Aristotle, “Phœnician mariners came in a four days’ voyage from\r\n  Gades to a place where the sea was found covered with rushes and\r\n  sea-weed (θρύον καὶ φῦκος). The sea-weed is uncovered at ebb, and\r\n  overflowed at flood tide.” Does he not here refer to a shoal lying\r\n  between the 34th and 36th degrees of latitude? Has a shoal disappeared\r\n  there in consequence of volcanic revolution? Vobonne refers to rocks\r\n  north of Madeira.[AL] In Scylax it is stated that “the sea beyond\r\n  Cerne ceases to be navigable in consequence of its great shallowness,\r\n  its muddiness, and its sea-grass. The sea-grass lies a span thick, and\r\n  it is pointed at its upper extremity, so that it pricks.” The sea-weed\r\n  which is found between Cerne (the Phœnician station for merchant\r\n  vessels, Gaulea; or, according to Gosselin, the small estuary of\r\n  Fedallah, on the north-west coast of Mauritania,) and Cape Verde, at\r\n  the present time by no means forms a great meadow or connected group,\r\n  “_mare herbidum_,” such as exists on the other side of the Azores.\r\n  Moreover, in the poetic description of the coast given by Festus\r\n  Avienus,[AM] in which, as Avienus himself very distinctly\r\n  acknowledges, he availed himself of the journals of Phœnician ships,\r\n  the impediments presented by the sea-weed are described with great\r\n  minuteness; but Avienus places the site of this obstacle much further\r\n  north, towards Ierne, the Holy Isle.\r\n\r\n                Sic nulla late flabra propellunt ratem,\r\n                Sic segnis humor æquoris pigri stupet.\r\n                Adjicit et illud, plurimum inter gurgites\r\n                Exstare fucum, et sæpe virgulti vice\r\n                Retinere puppim ...\r\n                Hæc inter undas multa cæspitem jacet,\r\n                Eamque late gens Hibemorum colit.\r\n\r\n  When we consider that the sea-weed (_fucus_), the mud or slime\r\n  (πηλὸς), the shallowness of the sea, and the perpetual calms, are\r\n  always regarded by the ancients as characteristic of the Western Ocean\r\n  beyond the Pillars of Hercules, we feel inclined, especially on\r\n  account of the reference to the _calms_, to ascribe this to Punic\r\n  cunning, to the tendency of a great trading people to hinder others,\r\n  by terrific descriptions, from competing with them in maritime trading\r\n  westwards. But even in the genuine writings of the Stagyrite,[AN] the\r\n  same opinion is retained regarding the absence of wind, and Aristotle\r\n  attempts to explain a false notion, or, as it seems to me, more\r\n  correctly speaking, a fabulous mariner’s story, by an hypothesis\r\n  regarding the depth of the sea. The stormy sea between Gades and the\r\n  Islands of the Blest (Cadiz and the Canaries) can in truth in no way\r\n  be compared with the sea, which lies between the tropics, ruffled only\r\n  by the gentle trade-winds (_vents alisés_), and which has been very\r\n  characteristically named by the Spaniards[AO] _El Golfo de las Damas_.\r\n\r\n  From very careful personal researches and from comparison of the logs\r\n  of many English and French vessels, I am led to believe that the old\r\n  and very indefinite expression _Mar de Sargasso_, refers to two fucus\r\n  banks, the larger of which is of an elongated form, and is the\r\n  easternmost one, lying between the parallels of 19° and 34°, in a\r\n  meridian 7° westward of the Island of Corvo, one of the Azores; while\r\n  the smaller and westernmost bank is of a roundish form, and is found\r\n  between Bermuda and the Bahama Islands (lat. 25°–31°, long. 66°–74°).\r\n  The principal diameter of the small bank, which is traversed by ships\r\n  sailing from Baxo de Plata (Caye d’Argent,) northward of St. Domingo\r\n  to the Bermudas, appears to me to have a N. 60° E. direction. A\r\n  transverse band of _fucus natans_, extending in an east-westerly\r\n  direction between the latitudes of 25° and 30°, connects the greater\r\n  with the smaller bank. I have had the pleasure of seeing these views\r\n  adopted by my lamented friend Major Rennell, and confirmed, in his\r\n  great work on Currents, by many new observations.[AP] The two groups\r\n  of sea-weed, together with the transverse band uniting them,\r\n  constitute the Sargasso Sea of the older writers, and collectively\r\n  occupy an area equal to six or seven times that of Germany.\r\n\r\n  The vegetation of the ocean thus offers the most remarkable example of\r\n  _social plants_ of a single species. On the main land the Savannahs or\r\n  grass plains of America, the heaths (_ericeta_), and the forests of\r\n  Northern Europe and Asia, in which are associated coniferous trees,\r\n  birches, and willows, produce a less striking uniformity than do these\r\n  thalassophytes. Our heaths present in the north not only the\r\n  predominating Calluna vulgaris, but also Erica tetralix, E. ciliaris,\r\n  and E. cinerea; and in the south, Erica arborea, E. scoparia, and E.\r\n  Mediterranea. The uniformity of the view presented by the Fucus natans\r\n  is incomparably greater than that of any other assemblage of social\r\n  plants. Oviedo calls the fucus banks “meadows,” _praderias de yerva_.\r\n  If we consider that Pedro Velasco, a native of the Spanish harbour of\r\n  Palos, by following the flight of certain birds from Fayal, discovered\r\n  the Island of Flores as early as 1452, it seems almost impossible,\r\n  considering the proximity of the great fucus bank of Corvo and Flores,\r\n  that no part of these oceanic meadows should have been seen before the\r\n  time of Columbus by Portuguese ships driven westward by storms.\r\n\r\n  We learn, however, from the astonishment of the companions of the\r\n  admiral, when they were continuously surrounded by sea-grass from the\r\n  16th of September to the 8th of October, 1492, that the magnitude of\r\n  the phenomenon was at that period unknown to mariners. In the extracts\r\n  from the ship’s journal given by Las Casas, Columbus certainly does\r\n  not mention the apprehensions which the accumulation of sea-weed\r\n  excited, or the grumbling of his companions. He merely speaks of the\r\n  complaints and murmurs regarding the danger of the very weak but\r\n  constant east winds. It was only his son, Fernando Colon, who in the\r\n  history of his father’s life, endeavoured to give a somewhat dramatic\r\n  delineation of the anxieties of the sailors.\r\n\r\n  According to my researches, Columbus made his way through the great\r\n  fucus bank in the year 1492, in latitude 28½°, and in 1493, in\r\n  latitude 37°, and both times in the longitude of 38°–41°. This can be\r\n  established with tolerable certainty from the estimation of the\r\n  velocity recorded by Columbus, and “the distance daily sailed over;”\r\n  not indeed by dropping the log, but by the information afforded by the\r\n  running out of half-hour sand-glasses (_ampolletas_). The first\r\n  certain and distinct account of the log, (_catena della poppa_,) which\r\n  I have found, is in the year 1521, in Pigafetta’s Journal of\r\n  Magellan’s Circumnavigation of the World.[AQ] The determination of the\r\n  ship’s place during the days in which Columbus was crossing the great\r\n  bank is the more important, because it shews us that for three\r\n  centuries and a half the total accumulation of these socially-living\r\n  thalassophytes, (whether consequent on the local character of the\r\n  sea’s bottom or on the direction of the recurrent Gulf stream,) has\r\n  remained at the same point. Such evidences of the persistence of great\r\n  natural phenomena doubly arrest the attention of the natural\r\n  philosopher, when they occur in the ever-moving oceanic element.\r\n  Although the limits of the fucus banks oscillate considerably, in\r\n  accordance with the strength and direction of long predominating\r\n  winds, yet we may still, in the middle of the nineteenth century, take\r\n  the meridian of 41° west of Paris (or 8° 38′ west of Greenwich) as the\r\n  principal axis of the _great bank_. Columbus, with his vivid\r\n  imaginative force, associated the idea of the position of this bank\r\n  with the great physical line of demarcation, which according to him,\r\n  “separated the globe into two parts, and was intimately connected with\r\n  the changes of magnetic deviation and of climatic relations.” Columbus\r\n  when he was uncertain regarding the longitude, attempted to determine\r\n  his place (February, 1493,) by the appearance of the first floating\r\n  masses of tangled weed (_de la primera yerva_) on the eastern border\r\n  of the great Corvo bank. The physical line of demarcation was, by the\r\n  powerful influence of the Admiral, converted on the 4th of May, 1493,\r\n  into a political one, in the celebrated _line of demarcation_ between\r\n  the Spanish and Portuguese rights of possession[AR].\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  p. 3—“_The Nomadic Tribes of Tibbos and Tuaryks_.”\r\n\r\n  These two nations, which inhabit the desert between Bornou, Fezzan,\r\n  and Lower Egypt, were first made more accurately known to us by the\r\n  travels of Hornemann and Lyon. The Tibbos or Tibbous occupy the\r\n  eastern, and the Tuaryks (Tueregs) the western portion of the great\r\n  sandy ocean. The former, from their habits of constant moving, were\r\n  named by the other tribes “birds.” The Tuaryks are subdivided into two\r\n  tribes—the Aghadez and the Tagazi. These are often caravan leaders and\r\n  merchants. They speak the same language as the Berbers, and\r\n  undoubtedly belong to the primitive Lybian races. They present the\r\n  remarkable physiological phenomenon that, according to the character\r\n  of the climate, the different tribes vary in complexion from a white\r\n  to a yellow, or even almost black hue; but they never have woolly hair\r\n  or negro features.[AS]\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  p. 3—“_The ship of the desert_.”\r\n\r\n  In the poetry of the East, the camel is designated as _the land-ship_,\r\n  or _the ship of the desert_ (_Sefynet-el-badyet_[AT]).\r\n\r\n  The camel is, however, not only the carrier in the desert, and the\r\n  medium for maintaining communication between different countries, but\r\n  is also, as Carl Bitter has shown in his admirable treatise on the\r\n  sphere of distribution of this animal, “the main requirement of a\r\n  nomadic mode of life in the patriarchal stage of national development,\r\n  in the torrid regions of our planet, where rain is either wholly or in\r\n  a great degree absent. No animal’s life is so closely associated by\r\n  natural bonds with a certain primitive stage of the development of the\r\n  life of man, as that of the camel among the Bedouin tribes, nor has\r\n  any other been established in like manner by a continuous historical\r\n  evidence of several thousand years.”[AU] “The camel was entirely\r\n  unknown to the cultivated people of Carthage through all the centuries\r\n  of their flourishing existence, until the destruction of the city. It\r\n  was first brought into use for armies by the Marusians, in Western\r\n  Lybia, in the times of the Cæsars; perhaps in consequence of its\r\n  employment in commercial undertakings by the Ptolemies, in the valley\r\n  of the Nile. The Guanches, inhabiting the Canary Islands, who were\r\n  probably related to the Berber race, were not acquainted with the\r\n  camel before the fifteenth century, when it was introduced by Norman\r\n  conquerors and settlers. In the probably very limited communication of\r\n  the Guanches with the coast of Africa, the smallness of their boats\r\n  must necessarily have impeded the transport of large animals. The true\r\n  Berber race, which was diffused throughout the interior of Northern\r\n  Africa, and to which the Tibbos and Tuaryks, as already observed,\r\n  belong, is probably indebted to the use of the camel throughout the\r\n  Lybian desert and its oases, not only for the advantages of internal\r\n  communication, but also for its escape from complete annihilation and\r\n  for the maintenance of its national existence to the present day. The\r\n  use of the camel continued, on the other hand, to be unknown to the\r\n  negro races, and it was only in company with the conquering\r\n  expeditions and proselyting missions of the Bedouins through the whole\r\n  of Northern Africa, that the useful animal of the Nedschd, of the\r\n  Nabatheans, and of all the districts occupied by Aramean races, spread\r\n  here, as elsewhere, to the westward. The Goths brought camels as early\r\n  as the fourth century to the Lower Istros (the Danube), and the\r\n  Ghaznevides transported them in much larger numbers to India as far as\r\n  the banks of the Ganges.” We must distinguish two epochs in the\r\n  distribution of the camel throughout the northern part of the African\r\n  continent; the first under the Ptolemies, which operated through\r\n  Cyrene on the whole of the north-west of Africa, and the second under\r\n  the Mahommedan epoch of the conquering Arabs.\r\n\r\n  It has long been a matter of discussion, whether those domestic\r\n  animals which were the earliest companions of mankind, as oxen, sheep,\r\n  dogs, and camels, are still to be met with in a state of original\r\n  wildness. The Hiongnu, in Eastern Asia, are among the nations who\r\n  earliest trained wild camels as domestic animals. The compiler of the\r\n  great Chinese work, _Si-yu-wen-kien-lo_[AV], states that in the middle\r\n  of the eighteenth century, wild camels, as well as wild horses and\r\n  wild asses, still roamed over Eastern Turkestan. Hadji Chalfa, in his\r\n  Turkish Geography, written in the seventeenth century, speaks of the\r\n  very frequent hunting of the wild camel in the high plains of Kashgar,\r\n  Turfan, and Khotan. Schott finds in the writings of a Chinese author,\r\n  Ma-dschi, that wild camels exist in the countries north of China and\r\n  west of the basin of the Hoang-ho, in Ho-si or Tangut. Cuvier[AW]\r\n  alone doubts the present existence of wild camels in the interior of\r\n  Asia. He believes that they have merely “become wild;” since Calmucks,\r\n  and others professing kindred Buddhist doctrines, set camels and other\r\n  animals at liberty, in order “to acquire to themselves merit for the\r\n  other world.” The Ailanitic Gulf of the Nabatheans was the home of the\r\n  wild Arabian camel, according to Greek witnesses of the times of\r\n  Artemidorus and Agatharchides of Cnidus.[AX] The discovery of fossil\r\n  camel-bones of the ancient world in the Sewalik hills (which are\r\n  projecting spurs of the Himalaya range), by Captain Cautley and Dr.\r\n  Falconer, in 1834, is especially worthy of notice. These remains were\r\n  found with antediluvian bones of mastodons, true elephants, giraffes,\r\n  and a gigantic land tortoise (_Colossochelys_), twelve feet in length\r\n  and six feet in height.[AY] This camel of the ancient world has been\r\n  named _Camelus sivalensis_, although it does not show any great\r\n  difference from the still living Egyptian and Bactrian camels with one\r\n  and two humps. Forty camels have very recently been introduced into\r\n  Java, from Teneriffe[AZ]. The first experiment has been made in\r\n  Samarang. In like manner, reindeer were only introduced into Iceland\r\n  from Norway in the course of the last century. They were not found\r\n  there when the island was first colonised, notwithstanding its\r\n  proximity to East Greenland, and the existence of floating masses of\r\n  ice.[BA]\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  p. 3—“_Between the Altai and the Kuen-lün_.”\r\n\r\n  The great highland, or, as it is commonly called, the mountain plateau\r\n  of Asia, which comprises the lesser Bucharia, Songaria, Thibet,\r\n  Tangut, and the Mogul country of the Chalcas and Olotes, is situated\r\n  between the 36th and 48th degrees of north latitude and the meridians\r\n  of 81° and 118° E. long. It is an erroneous idea to represent this\r\n  part of the interior of Asia as a single, undivided mountainous\r\n  swelling, continuous like the plateaux of Quito and Mexico, and\r\n  situated from seven to upwards of nine thousand feet above the level\r\n  of the sea. I have already shown in my “_Researches respecting the\r\n  Mountains of Northern India_,[BB]” that there is not in this sense any\r\n  continuous mountain plateau in the interior of Asia.\r\n\r\n  My views concerning the geographical distribution of plants, and the\r\n  mean degree of temperature requisite for certain kinds of cultivation,\r\n  had early led me to entertain considerable doubts regarding the\r\n  continuity of a great Tartarian plateau between the Himalaya and the\r\n  chain of the Altai. This plateau continued to be characterized, as it\r\n  had been described by Hippocrates, as “the high and naked plains of\r\n  Scythia, which, without being crowned with mountains, rise and extend\r\n  to beneath the constellation of the Bear.”[BC] Klaproth has the\r\n  undeniable merit of having been the first to make us acquainted with\r\n  the true position and prolongation of two great and entirely distinct\r\n  chains of mountains,—the Kuen-lün and the Thian-schan, in a part of\r\n  Asia which better deserves to be termed “central,” than Kashmeer,\r\n  Baltistan, and the Sacred Lakes of Thibet (the Manasa and the\r\n  Ravanahrada). The importance of the Celestial Mountains (the\r\n  Thian-schan) had indeed been already surmised by Pallas, without his\r\n  being conscious of their volcanic character; but this highly-gifted\r\n  investigator of nature, led astray by the hypotheses of the dogmatic\r\n  and fantastic geology prevalent in his time, and firmly believing in\r\n  “chains of mountains radiating from a centre,” saw in the Bogdo Oola\r\n  (the _Mons Augustus_, or culminating point of the Thian-schan,) such\r\n  “a central node, whence all the other Asiatic mountain chains diverge\r\n  in rays, and which dominates over all the rest of the continent!”\r\n\r\n  The erroneous idea of a single boundless and elevated plain, occupying\r\n  the whole of Central Asia, the “_Plateau de la Tartarie_,” originated\r\n  in France, in the latter half of the eighteenth century. It was the\r\n  result of historical combinations, and of a not sufficiently attentive\r\n  study of the writings of the celebrated Venetian traveller, as well as\r\n  of the naïve relations of those diplomatic monks who, in the\r\n  thirteenth and fourteenth centuries (thanks to the unity and extent of\r\n  the Mogul empire at that time), were able to traverse almost the whole\r\n  of the interior of the continent, from the ports of Syria and of the\r\n  Caspian Sea to the east coast of China, washed by the great ocean. If\r\n  a more exact acquaintance with the language and ancient literature of\r\n  India were of an older date among us than half a century, the\r\n  hypothesis of this central plateau, occupying the wide space between\r\n  the Himalaya and the south of Siberia, would no doubt have sought\r\n  support from some ancient and venerable authority. The poem of the\r\n  Mahabharata appears, in the geographical fragment Bhischmakanda, to\r\n  describe “Meru” not so much as a mountain as an enormous swelling of\r\n  the land, which supplies with water the sources of the Ganges, those\r\n  of the Bhadrasoma (Irtysch), and those of the forked Oxus. These\r\n  physico-geographical views were intermingled in Europe with ideas of\r\n  other kinds, and with mythical reveries on the origin of mankind. The\r\n  lofty regions from which the waters were supposed to have first\r\n  retreated (for geologists in general were long averse to the theories\r\n  of elevation) must also have received the first germs of civilization.\r\n  Hebraic systems of geology, based on ideas of a deluge, and supported\r\n  by local traditions, favoured these assumptions. The intimate\r\n  connexion between time and space, between the beginning of social\r\n  order and the plastic condition of the surface of the earth, lent a\r\n  peculiar importance and an almost moral interest to the Plateau of\r\n  Tartary, which was supposed to be characterized by uninterrupted\r\n  continuity. Acquisitions of positive knowledge,—the late matured fruit\r\n  of scientific travels and direct measurements,—with a fundamental\r\n  study of the languages and literature of Asia, and more especially of\r\n  China, have gradually demonstrated the inaccuracy and exaggeration of\r\n  those wild hypotheses. The mountain plains (ὀροπέδια) of Central Asia\r\n  are no longer regarded as the cradle of human civilization, and the\r\n  primitive seat of all arts and sciences. The ancient nation of\r\n  Bailly’s Atlantis, which d’Alembert has happily described as “having\r\n  taught us everything but its own name and existence,” has vanished.\r\n  The inhabitants of the Oceanic Atlantis were already treated, in the\r\n  time of Posidonius, as having a merely apocryphal existence.[BD]\r\n\r\n  A plateau of considerable but very unequal elevation runs with little\r\n  interruption, in a S.S.W.-N.N.E. direction, from Eastern Thibet\r\n  towards the mountain node of Kentei, south of Lake Baikal, and is\r\n  known by the names of Gobi, Scha-mo, (sand desert,) Scha-ho. (sand\r\n  river,) and Han-hai. This swelling of the ground, which is probably\r\n  more ancient than the elevation of the mountain-chains by which it is\r\n  intersected, is situated, as we have already remarked, between 81° and\r\n  118° east longitude from Greenwich. Measured at right angles to its\r\n  longitudinal axis, its breadth in the south, between Ladak, Gertop,\r\n  and H’lassa (the seat of the great Lama), is 720 miles; between Hami\r\n  in the Celestial Mountains, and the great curve of the Hoang-ho, near\r\n  the In-schan chain, it is scarcely 480; but in the north, between the\r\n  Khanggai, where the great city of Karakhorum once stood, and the chain\r\n  of Khin-gan-Petscha, which runs in a meridian line (in the part of\r\n  Gobi traversed in going from Kiachta to Pekin by way of Urga), it is\r\n  760 miles. The whole extent of this elevated ground, which must be\r\n  carefully distinguished from the more eastern and higher\r\n  mountain-range, may be approximately estimated, including its\r\n  deflections, at about three times the area of France. The map of the\r\n  mountain-ranges and volcanoes of Central Asia, which I constructed in\r\n  1839, but did not publish until 1843, shows in the clearest manner the\r\n  hypsometric relations between the mountain-ranges and the Gobi\r\n  plateau. It was founded on the critical employment of all the\r\n  astronomical determinations accessible to me, and on many of the very\r\n  rich and copious orographic descriptions in which Chinese literature\r\n  abounds, and which were examined at my request by Klaproth and\r\n  Stanislaus Julien. My map marks in prominent characters the mean\r\n  direction and the height of the mountain-chains, together with the\r\n  chief features of the interior of the continent of Asia from 30 to 60\r\n  degrees of latitude, between the meridians of Pekin and Cherson. It\r\n  differs essentially from any map hitherto published.\r\n\r\n  The Chinese enjoyed a triple advantage, by means of which they were\r\n  enabled to enrich their earliest literature with so considerable an\r\n  amount of orographic knowledge regarding Upper Asia, and more\r\n  especially those regions situated between the In-schan, the alpine\r\n  lake of Khuku-noor, and the shores of the Ili and Tarim, lying north\r\n  and south of the Celestial Mountains, and which were so little known\r\n  to Western Europe. These three advantages were, besides the peaceful\r\n  conquests of the Buddhist pilgrims, the warlike expeditions towards\r\n  the west (as early as the dynasties of Han and Thang, one hundred and\r\n  twenty-two years before our era, and again in the ninth century, when\r\n  conquerors advanced as far as Ferghana and the shores of the Caspian\r\n  Sea); the religious interest attached to certain high mountain\r\n  summits, on account of the periodical performance of sacrifices, in\r\n  accordance with pre-existing enactments; and lastly, the early and\r\n  generally known use of the compass for determining the direction of\r\n  mountains and rivers. This use, and the knowledge of the\r\n  south-pointing of the magnetic needle, twelve centuries before the\r\n  Christian era, gave a great superiority to the orographic and\r\n  hydrographic descriptions of the Chinese over those of Greek and Roman\r\n  authors, who treated less frequently of subjects of this nature. The\r\n  acute observer Strabo was alike ignorant of the direction of the\r\n  Pyrenees and of that of the Alps and Apennines.[BE]\r\n\r\n  To the lowlands belong almost the whole of Northern Asia to the\r\n  north-west of the volcanic Celestial Mountains (Thian-schan); the\r\n  steppes to the north of the Altai and the Sayanic chain; and the\r\n  countries which extend from the mountains of Bolor, or Bulyt-tagh\r\n  (Cloud Mountains in the Uigurian dialect), which run in a north and\r\n  south direction, and from the upper Oxus, whose sources were\r\n  discovered in the Pamershian Lake, Sir-i-kol (Lake Victoria), by the\r\n  Buddhist pilgrims Hiuen-thsang and Song-yun in 518 and 629, by Marco\r\n  Polo in 1277, and by Lieutenant Wood in 1838, towards the Caspian Sea;\r\n  and from Lake Tenghiz or Balkasch, through the Kirghis Steppe, towards\r\n  the Aral and the southern extremity of the Ural Mountains. In the\r\n  vicinity of mountainous plains, whose elevation varies from 6000 to\r\n  more than 10,000 feet above the sea’s level, we may assuredly be\r\n  allowed to apply the term lowlands to districts which are only\r\n  elevated from 200 to 1200 feet. The first of these heights correspond\r\n  with that of the city of Mannheim, and the second with that of Geneva\r\n  and Tübingen. If we extend the application of the word _plateau_,\r\n  which has so frequently been misused by modern geographers, to\r\n  elevations of the soil which scarcely present any sensible difference\r\n  in the character of the vegetation and climate, physical geography,\r\n  owing to the indefiniteness of the merely relatively important terms\r\n  of _high_ and _low_ land, will be unable to distinguish the connexion\r\n  between elevation above the sea’s level and climate, between the\r\n  decrease of the temperature and the increase in elevation. When I was\r\n  in Chinese Dzungarei, between the boundaries of Siberia and Lake\r\n  Saysan (Dsaisang), at an equal distance from the Icy Sea and the mouth\r\n  of the Ganges, I might assuredly consider myself to be in _Central\r\n  Asia_. The barometer, however, soon showed me that the elevation of\r\n  the plains watered by the Upper Irtysch between Ustkamenogorsk and the\r\n  Chinese Dzungarian post of Chonimailachu (the sheep-bleating) was\r\n  scarcely as much as from 850 to 1170 feet. Pansner’s earlier\r\n  barometric determinations of height, which were first made known after\r\n  my expedition, have been confirmed by my own observations. Both afford\r\n  a refutation of the hypotheses of Chappe D’Auteroche (based on\r\n  calculations of the fall of rivers) regarding the elevated position of\r\n  the shores of the Irtysch, in Southern Siberia. Even further eastward,\r\n  the Lake of Baikal is only 1420 feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n  In order to associate the idea of the _relation_ between _lowlands_\r\n  and _highlands_, and of the successive gradations in the elevation of\r\n  the soil, with actual data based on accurate measurements, I subjoin a\r\n  table, in which the heights of the elevated plains of Europe, Africa,\r\n  and America are given in an ascending scale. With these numbers we may\r\n  then further compare all that has as yet been made known regarding the\r\n  mean height of the Asiatic plains, or true _lowlands_.\r\n\r\n                                                          Toises.

A very accurate barometrical levelling was executed,\r\n  under the auspices of the Academy of St. Petersburgh, by two\r\n  distinguished savans—the astronomer George Fuss, and the botanist\r\n  Bunge. They accompanied a mission of Greek monks to Pekin, in the year\r\n  1832, in order to establish there one of those magnetic stations whose\r\n  construction I had recommended. The mean height of this portion of the\r\n  Desert of Gobi amounts hardly to 4263 feet, and not to 8000 or 8500\r\n  feet, as had been too hastily concluded from the measurements of\r\n  contiguous mountain summits by the Jesuits Gerbillon and Verbiest. The\r\n  surface of the Desert of Gobi is not more than 2558 feet above the\r\n  level of the sea between Erghi, Durma, and Scharaburguna; and scarcely\r\n  more than 320 feet higher than the plateau of Madrid. Erghi is\r\n  situated midway, in 45° 31′ north lat., and 111° 26′ east long., in a\r\n  depression of the land extending in a direction from south-west to\r\n  north-east over a breadth of more than 240 miles. An ancient Mongolian\r\n  saga designates this spot as the former site of a large inland sea.\r\n  Reeds and saline plants, generally of the same species as those found\r\n  on the low shores of the Caspian Sea, are here met with; while there\r\n  are in this central part of the desert several small saline lakes, the\r\n  salt of which is carried to China. According to a singular opinion\r\n  prevalent among the Mongols, the ocean will at some period return, and\r\n  again establish its dominion in Gobi. Such geological reveries remind\r\n  us of the Chinese traditions of the _bitter lake_, in the interior of\r\n  Siberia, of which I have elsewhere spoken.[BF]\r\n\r\n  The basin of Kashmir, which has been so enthusiastically praised by\r\n  Bernier, and too moderately estimated by Victor Jacquemont, has also\r\n  given occasion to great hypsometric exaggerations. Jacquemont found by\r\n  an accurate barometric measurement that the height of the Wulur Lake,\r\n  in the valley of Kashmir, near the capital Sirinagur, was 5346 feet.\r\n  Uncertain determinations by the boiling point of water gave Baron Carl\r\n  von Hügel 5819 feet, and Lieutenant Cunningham only 5052 feet.[BG] The\r\n  mountainous districts of Kashmir, which has excited so great an\r\n  interest in Germany, and whose climatic advantages have lost somewhat\r\n  of their reputation since Carl von Hügel’s account of the four months\r\n  of winter snow in the streets of Sirinagur,[BH] does not lie on the\r\n  high crests of the Himalaya, as has commonly been supposed, but\r\n  constitutes a true cauldron-like valley on their southern declivity.\r\n  On the south-west, where the rampart-like Pir Panjal separates it from\r\n  the Indian Punjaub, the snow-crowned summits are covered, according to\r\n  Vigne, by basaltic and amygdaloid formations. The latter are very\r\n  characteristically termed by the natives _schischak deyu_, or devil’s\r\n  pock-marks.[BI] The charms of the vegetation have also been very\r\n  differently described, according as travellers passed into Kashmir\r\n  from the south, and left behind them the luxuriant and varied\r\n  vegetation of India; or from the northern regions of Turkestan,\r\n  Samarkand, and Ferghana.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, it is only very recently that we have obtained a clearer\r\n  view regarding the elevation of Thibet, the level of the plateau\r\n  having long been uncritically confounded with the mountain tops rising\r\n  from it. Thibet occupies the space between the two great chains of the\r\n  Himalaya and the Kuen-lün, and forms the elevated ground of the valley\r\n  between them. The land is divided from east to west, both by the\r\n  inhabitants and by Chinese geographers, into three parts. We\r\n  distinguish Upper Thibet, with its capital, H’lassa (probably 9592\r\n  feet high); Middle Thibet, with the town of Leh or Ladak (9995 feet);\r\n  and Little Thibet, or Baltistan, called the Thibet of Apricots\r\n  (Sari-Butan), in which lie Iskardo (6300 feet), Gilgit, and south of\r\n  Iskardo, but on the left bank of the Indus, the plateau Deotsuh, whose\r\n  elevation was determined by Vigne (11,977 feet). On carefully\r\n  examining all the notices we have hitherto possessed regarding the\r\n  three Thibets, and which will have been abundantly augmented during\r\n  the present year by the brilliant boundary surveying expedition under\r\n  the auspices of the Governor-general, Lord Dalhousie, we soon become\r\n  convinced that the region between the Himalaya and the Kuen-lün is no\r\n  unbroken table-land, but that it is intersected by mountain groups,\r\n  which undoubtedly belong to perfectly distinct systems of elevation.\r\n  Actual plains are very few in number: the most considerable are those\r\n  between Gertop, Daba, Schang-thung (the Shepherd’s Plain), the native\r\n  country of the shawl-goat, and Schipke (10,449 feet); those round\r\n  Ladak, which attain an elevation of 13,429 feet, and must not be\r\n  confounded with the depressed land in which the town lies; and\r\n  finally, the plateau of the Sacred Lakes, Manasa and Ravanahrada\r\n  (probably 14,965 feet), which was visited by Father Antonio de Andrada\r\n  as early as the year 1625. Other parts are entirely filled with\r\n  compressed mountain masses, “rising,” as a recent traveller observes,\r\n  “like the waves of a vast ocean.” Along the rivers, the Indus, the\r\n  Sutledge, and the Yaru-dzangbotschu, which was formerly regarded as\r\n  identical with the Buramputer (or correctly the Brahmaputra), points\r\n  have been measured which are only between 6714 and 8952 feet above the\r\n  sea; and the same is the case with the Thibetian villages Pangi,\r\n  Kunawur, Kelu, and Murung.[BJ] From many carefully collected\r\n  determinations of heights, I think that we are justified in assuming\r\n  that the plateau of Thibet between 73° and 85° east long, does not\r\n  attain a mean elevation of 11,510 feet: this is hardly the elevation\r\n  of the fruitful plain of Caxamarca in Peru, and is 1349 and 2155 feet\r\n  less than the plateau of Titicaca, and of the street pavement of the\r\n  Upper Town of Potosi (13,665 feet).\r\n\r\n  That beyond the Thibetian highlands and the Gobi, whose outline has\r\n  been already defined, Asia presents considerable depressions, and\r\n  indeed true lowlands, between the parallels of 37° and 48°, where once\r\n  an immeasurable continuous plateau was fabulously supposed to exist,\r\n  is proved by the cultivation of plants which cannot flourish without a\r\n  certain degree of temperature. An attentive study of the travels of\r\n  Marco Polo, in which mention is made of the cultivation of the vine,\r\n  and of the production of cotton in northern latitudes, had long ago\r\n  directed the attention of the acute Klaproth to this point. In a\r\n  Chinese work, bearing the title _Information respecting the recently\r\n  conquered Barbarians_ (Sinkiang-wai-tan-ki-lio), it is stated that\r\n  “the country of Aksu, somewhat to the south of the Celestial\r\n  Mountains, near the rivers which form the great Tarim-gol, produces\r\n  grapes, pomegranates, and numberless other fruits of singular\r\n  excellence; also cotton (Gossypium religiosum), which, covers the\r\n  fields like yellow clouds. In summer the heat is extremely great, and\r\n  in winter there is here, as at Turfan, neither intense cold nor heavy\r\n  snow.” The neighbourhood of Khotan, Kaschgar, and Yarkand still, as in\r\n  the time of Marco Polo,[BK] pays its tribute in home-grown cotton. In\r\n  the oasis of Hami (Khamil), above 200 miles east of Aksu, orange\r\n  trees, pomegranates, and the finer vines are found to flourish.\r\n\r\n  The products of cultivation which are here noticed lead to the belief\r\n  that over extensive districts the elevation of the soil is very\r\n  slight. At so great a distance from the sea side, and in the easterly\r\n  situation which so much increases the degree of winter cold, a\r\n  plateau, as high as Madrid or Munich, might indeed have a very hot\r\n  summer, but would hardly have, in 43° and 44° latitude, an extremely\r\n  mild and almost snowless winter. I have seen a high summer heat favour\r\n  the cultivation of the vine, as at the Caspian Sea, 83 feet below the\r\n  level of the Black Sea (at Astrakhan, latitude 46° 21′); but the\r\n  winter cold is there from –4° to –13°. Moreover, the vine is sunk to a\r\n  greater depth in the ground after the month of November. We can\r\n  understand that cultivated plants, which, as it were, live only in the\r\n  summer, as the vine, the cotton plant, rice, and melons, may be\r\n  cultivated with success between the latitudes of 40° and 44°, on\r\n  plateaux at an elevation of more than 3000[BL] feet, and may be\r\n  favoured by the action of radiant heat; but how could the pomegranate\r\n  trees of Aksu, and the orange trees of Hami, whose fruit Father\r\n  Grosier extolled as excellent, endure a long and severe winter (the\r\n  necessary consequence of a great elevation[BM])? Carl Zimmerman[BN]\r\n  has shown it to be extremely probable that the Tarim depression, or\r\n  the desert between the mountain chain of Thian-schan and Kuen-lün,\r\n  where the steppe river Tarim-gol discharges itself into the Lake of\r\n  Lop, formerly described as an alpine lake, is hardly 1280 feet above\r\n  the level of the sea, or only twice the elevation of Prague. Sir\r\n  Alexander Burnes also ascribes to Bokhara only an elevation of 1188\r\n  feet. It is most earnestly to be desired that all doubt regarding the\r\n  elevation of the plateaux of Central Asia, south of 45° north\r\n  latitude, should finally be removed by direct barometrical\r\n  measurements, or by determinations of the boiling point of water,\r\n  conducted with greater care than is usual in these cases. All our\r\n  calculations of the difference between the limits of perpetual snow\r\n  and the maximum elevation of vine cultivation in different climates,\r\n  rest at present on too complex and uncertain elements.\r\n\r\n  In order as briefly as possible to rectify that which has been\r\n  advanced in the former edition of the present work, regarding the\r\n  great mountain systems which intersect the interior of Asia, I subjoin\r\n  the following general review:—We begin with the four _parallel\r\n  chains_, which run, with tolerable regularity, from east to west, and\r\n  are connected together by means of a few detached transverse lines.\r\n  Differences of direction indicate, as in the Alps of Western Europe, a\r\n  difference in the epoch of elevation. After the four parallel chains\r\n  (the _Altai_, the _Thian-schan_, the _Kuen-lün_, and the _Himalaya_)\r\n  we must consider as following the direction of meridian, the Ural, the\r\n  Bolor, the Khingan, and the Chinese chains, which, with the great\r\n  inflection of the Thibetian and Assam-Birmese Dzangbo-tschu incline\r\n  from north to south. The Ural divides a depressed portion of Europe\r\n  from a similarly low portion of Asia. The latter was called by\r\n  Herodotus,[BO] and even earlier by Pherecydes of Syros, Scythian or\r\n  Siberian Europe, and comprised all the countries to the north of the\r\n  Caspian and of the Iaxartes, which flows from east to west, and may\r\n  therefore be regarded as a continuation of our Europe, “as it now\r\n  exists, extending lengthwise across the continent of Asia.”\r\n\r\n  1. The great mountain system of the Altai (the “gold mountains” of\r\n  Menander of Byzantium, an historical writer of the seventh century;\r\n  the Altaï-alin of the Moguls, and the Kin-schan of the Chinese) forms\r\n  the southern boundary of the great Siberian lowlands, and running\r\n  between 50° and 52½° north latitude, extends from the rich silver\r\n  mines of the Snake Mountains, and the confluence of the Uba and the\r\n  Irtysch, to the meridian of Lake Baikal. The divisions and names of\r\n  the “Great” and the “Little Altai,” taken from an obscure passage of\r\n  Abulghasi, should be wholly avoided.[BP] The mountain system of the\r\n  Altai comprehends—(_a_) the Altai proper, or Kolywanski Altai, which\r\n  is entirely under the Russian sceptre: it lies to the west of the\r\n  intersecting fissures of the Telezki Lake, which follow the direction\r\n  of the meridian; and in ante-historic times probably constituted the\r\n  eastern shore of the great arm of the sea, by which, in the direction\r\n  of the still existing lakes, Aksakal-Barbi and Sary-Kupa,[BQ] the\r\n  Aralo-Caspian basin was connected with the Icy sea;—(_b_) East of the\r\n  Telezki chains, which follow the direction of the meridian, the\r\n  Sayani, Tangnu, and Ulangom, or Malakha ranges, all tolerably parallel\r\n  with each other, and following an east and west direction. The Tangnu,\r\n  which merges in the basin of the Selenga, has, from very remote times,\r\n  constituted the national boundary between the Turkish race, to the\r\n  south, and the Kirghis (Hakas, identical with Σάκαι), to the\r\n  north.[BR] It is the original seat of the Samoieds or Soyotes. who\r\n  wandered as far as the Icy Sea, and were long regarded in Europe as a\r\n  race inhabiting exclusively the coasts of the Polar Sea. The highest\r\n  snow-covered summits of the Kolywan Altai are the Bielucha and the\r\n  Katunia Pillars. The latter attain only a height of about 11,000 feet,\r\n  or about the height of Etna. The Daurian highland, to which the\r\n  mountain node of Kentei belongs, and on whose eastern margin lies the\r\n  Jablonoi Chrebet, divides the depressions of the Baikal and the Amur.\r\n\r\n  2. The mountain system of the Thian-schan, or the chain of the\r\n  Celestial Mountains, the Tengri-tagh of the Turks (Tukiu), and of the\r\n  kindred race of the Hiongnu, is eight times as long, in an east and\r\n  west direction, as the Pyrenees. Beyond, that is to say, to the west\r\n  of its intersection with the meridian chain of the Bolor and Kosuyrt,\r\n  the Thian-schan bears the names of Asferah and Aktagh, is rich in\r\n  metals, and is intersected with open fissures, which emit hot vapours\r\n  luminous at night, and which are used for obtaining sal-ammoniac.[BS]\r\n  East of the transverse Bolor and Kosyurt chain, there follow\r\n  successively in the Thian-schan, the Kashgar Pass (Kaschgar-dawan),\r\n  the Glacier Pass of Djeparle, which leads to Kutch and Aksu in the\r\n  Tarim basin; the volcano of Pe-schan, which erupted fire and streams\r\n  of lava at least as late as the middle of the seventh century; the\r\n  great snow-covered massive elevation of Bogdo-Oola; the Solfatara of\r\n  Urumtsi, which furnishes sulphur and sal-ammoniac (nao-scha), and lies\r\n  in a coal district; the volcano of Turfan (or volcano of Ho-tscheu or\r\n  Bischbalik), almost midway between the meridians of Turfan (Kune\r\n  Turpan), and of Pidjan, and which is still in a state of activity. The\r\n  volcanic eruptions of the Thian-schan chain reach, according to\r\n  Chinese historians, as far back as the year 89, A.D., when the Hiongnu\r\n  were pursued by the Chinese from the sources of the Irtysch as far as\r\n  Kutch and Kharaschar[BT]. The Chinese General, Teu-hian, crossed the\r\n  Thian-schan, and saw “the Fire Mountains, which sent out masses of\r\n  molten rock that flow to the distance of many _Li_.”\r\n\r\n  The great distance of the volcanoes of the interior of Asia from the\r\n  sea coast is a remarkable and isolated phenomenon. Abel Rémusat, in a\r\n  letter to Cordier[BU], first directed the attention of geologists to\r\n  this fact. This distance, for instance, in the case of the volcano of\r\n  Pe-schan, from the north or the Icy Sea at the mouth of the Obi, is\r\n  1528 miles; and from the south or the mouths of the Indus and the\r\n  Ganges, 1512 miles; so central is the position of fire-emitting\r\n  volcanoes in the Asiatic continent. To the west its distance from the\r\n  Caspian at the Gulf of Karuboghaz, is 1360 miles, and from the east\r\n  shores of the Lake of Aral, 1020 miles. The active volcanoes of the\r\n  New World had hitherto offered the most remarkable examples of great\r\n  distance from the sea coast, but in the case of the volcano of\r\n  Popocatepetl, in Mexico, this distance is only one hundred and\r\n  thirty-two miles, and only ninety-two, one hundred and four, and one\r\n  hundred and fifty-six, respectively in the South American volcanoes\r\n  Sangai, Tolima, and de la Fragua. All extinct volcanoes, and all\r\n  trachytic mountains, which have no permanent connexion with the\r\n  interior of the earth, have been excluded from these statements[BV].\r\n  East of the volcano of Turfat, and of the fruitful Oasis of Hami, the\r\n  chain of the Thian-schan merges into the great elevated tract of Gobi,\r\n  which runs in a S.W. and N.E. direction. This interruption of the\r\n  mountain chain continues for more than 9½ degrees of longitude; it is\r\n  caused by the transversal intersection of the Gobi, but beyond the\r\n  latter, the more southern chain of In-schan (Silver Mountains),\r\n  proceeding from west to east, to the shores of the Pacific near Pekin\r\n  (north of the Pe-tscheli), forms a continuation of the Thian-schan. As\r\n  we may regard the In-schan as an eastern prolongation of the fissure\r\n  from which the Thian-schan is upheaved, so we may also be inclined to\r\n  consider the Caucasus as a western prolongation of the same range,\r\n  beyond the Great Aralo-Caspian basin or of the lowlands of Turan. The\r\n  mean parallel or axis of elevation of the Thian-schan oscillates\r\n  between 40° 40′ and 43° north latitude; that of the Caucasus\r\n  (inclining, according to the map of the Russian Staff, from E.S.E. to\r\n  W.N.W.) between 41° and 44°.[BW] Of the four parallel chains that\r\n  traverse Asia, the Thian-schan is the only one of which no summit has\r\n  as yet been measured.\r\n\r\n  3. The mountain system of the Kuen-lün (Kurkun or Kulkun), including\r\n  the Hindoo-Coosh, with its western prolongation in the Persian Elburz\r\n  and Demavend, and the American chain of the Andes, constitute the\r\n  longest lines of elevation on our planet. At the point where the\r\n  meridian chain of the Bolor intersects the Kuen-lün at right angles,\r\n  the latter receives the name of Onion Mountains (Tchsung-ling), a term\r\n  also applied to a portion of the Bolor at the inner eastern angle of\r\n  intersection. Bounding Thibet in the north, the Kuen-lün runs in a\r\n  regular direction from east to west, in the parallel of 36° north\r\n  latitude; until the chain is broken in the meridian of H’lassa, by the\r\n  vast mountain node which surrounds the _Sea of Stars_, _Sing so-hai_\r\n  (so celebrated in the mythical geography of the Chinese), and the\r\n  Alpine lake of Khuku-noor. The chains of Nan-schan and Kilian-schan,\r\n  lying somewhat further north, and extending to the Chinese wall near\r\n  Liang-tsheu, may almost be regarded as the eastern prolongation of the\r\n  Kuen-lün. To the west of the intersection of the Bolor and the\r\n  Kuen-lün (Tchsung-ling), the regular direction of the axes of\r\n  elevation (inclining from east to west in the Kuen-lün and\r\n  Hindoo-Coosh, and from south-east to north-west in the Himalaya)\r\n  proves, as I have elsewhere attempted to show, that the Hindoo-Coosh\r\n  is a prolongation of the Kuen-lün and not of the Himalaya.[BX] From\r\n  the Taurus in Lycia to the Kafiristan, the chain follows the parallel\r\n  of Rhodes (the diaphragm of Dicæarchus) over a distance of 45 degrees\r\n  of longitude. The grand geological views of Eratosthenes,[BY] which\r\n  were further developed by Marinus of Tyre, and by Ptolemy, and\r\n  according to which “the prolongation of the Taurus in Lycia was\r\n  continued, in the same direction, through all Asia as far as India,”\r\n  appear in part to be based on representations derived by the Persians\r\n  and Indians from the Punjaub.\r\n\r\n  “The Brahmins maintain,” says Cosmas Indicopleustes, in his Christian\r\n  Topography[BZ], “that a line drawn from Tzinitza (Thinæ) across Persia\r\n  and Romania, would exactly pass over the centre of the inhabited\r\n  earth.” It is remarkable, as Eratosthenes observes, that this greatest\r\n  axis of elevation in the old world passes directly through the basin\r\n  (the depression) of the Mediterranean, in the parallels of 35½° and\r\n  36° north latitude, to the Pillars of Hercules.[CA] The most eastern\r\n  portion of Hindoo-Coosh is the Paropanisus of the ancients, the Indian\r\n  Caucasus of the companions of the great Macedonian. The name of\r\n  _Hindoo-Coosh_, which is so frequently used by geographers, does not\r\n  in reality apply to more than one single mountain pass, where the\r\n  climate is so severe, as we learn from the travels of the Arabian\r\n  writer, Ibn Batuta, that many Indian slaves frequently perish from the\r\n  cold.[CB] The Kuen-lün still exhibits active fire-emitting eruptions\r\n  at the distance of several hundred miles from the sea-coast. Flames,\r\n  visible at a great distance, burst from the cavern of the mountain of\r\n  Schinkhieu, as I learn from a translation of the Yuen-thong-ki, made\r\n  by my friend Stanislaus Julien.[CC] The loftiest summit in the\r\n  Hindoo-Coosh, north-west of Jellalabad, is 20,232 feet above the level\r\n  of the sea; to the west, towards Herat, the chain sinks to 2558 feet,\r\n  rising again north of Teheran, in the volcano of Demavend, to the\r\n  height of 14,675 feet.\r\n\r\n  4. The mountain system of the Himalaya has a normal direction from\r\n  east to west, running more than 15 degrees of longitude (from 81° to\r\n  97°), or from the colossal mountain Dhawalagiri (28,072 feet) to the\r\n  intersection of the Dzangbo-tscheu (the Irawaddy of Dalrymple and\r\n  Klaproth), whose existence was long regarded as problematical, and to\r\n  the meridian chains, which cover the whole of Western China, and form\r\n  the great mountain group, from which spring the sources of the Kiang,\r\n  in the provinces of Sse-tschuan, Hu-kuang, and Kuang-si. Next to the\r\n  Dhawalagiri, the Kinchinjinga, and not the more eastern peak of\r\n  Schamalari, as has hitherto been supposed, is the highest point of\r\n  this portion of the Himalaya, which inclines from east to west. The\r\n  Kinchinjinga, in the meridian of Sikhim, between Butan and Nepal,\r\n  between the Schamalari (23,980 feet) and the Dhawalagiri, is 28,174\r\n  feet in height.\r\n\r\n  It is only within the present year that it has been trigonometrically\r\n  measured with exactness, and as I learn from India through the same\r\n  channel, “that a new measurement of the Dhawalagiri still leaves it\r\n  the first place among all the snow-crowned summits of the Himalaya,”\r\n  this mountain must necessarily have a greater elevation than the\r\n  28,072 feet hitherto ascribed to it.[CD] The point of deflection in\r\n  the direction of the chain is, near the Dhawalagiri, in 81° 22′, east\r\n  longitude. From thence the Himalaya no longer follows a due west\r\n  direction, but runs from S.E. to N.W., as a vast connecting system of\r\n  veins between Mozufer-abad and Gilgit, merging into a part of the\r\n  Hindoo-Coosh chain in the south of Kafiristan. Such a turn and\r\n  alteration in the line of the axis of elevation of the Himalaya (from\r\n  E.-W. to S.E.-N.W.) certainly indicates, as in the western region of\r\n  our European Alpine mountains, a different age or period of elevation.\r\n  The course of the Upper Indus, from the sacred lakes of Manasa and\r\n  Itavana-hrada, (at an elevation of 14,965 feet,) in the vicinity of\r\n  which this great river takes its origin, to Iskardo, and to the\r\n  plateau of Deotsuh (at an elevation of 12,994 feet), measured by\r\n  Vigne, follows in the Thibetian highlands the same north-westerly\r\n  direction as the Himalaya.\r\n\r\n  Here are situated the Djawahir, whose height was long since accurately\r\n  determined at 26,902 feet, and the Alpine valley of Caschmere (never\r\n  visited by winds or storms), where, at an elevation of only 5346 feet,\r\n  lies the lake of Wulur, which freezes every winter, and whose surface\r\n  is never broken by a single ripple.\r\n\r\n  After considering the four great mountain systems of Asia, which, in\r\n  their normal geognostic character, are true parallel chains, we must\r\n  turn to the long series of _alternating_ elevations following a\r\n  direction from north to south, and which extend from Cape Comorin,\r\n  opposite to the island of Ceylon, to the Icy Sea, alternating between\r\n  the parallels of 66° and 77° east longitude, from S.S.E. to N.N.W. To\r\n  this system of meridian chains, whose alternations remind us of faults\r\n  in veins, belong the Ghauts, the Soliman chain, the Paralasa, the\r\n  Bolor, and the Ural range. This interruption of the profile of the\r\n  elevation is so constituted, that each new chain begins in a degree of\r\n  latitude beyond that to which the preceding one had attained, all\r\n  alternating successively in an opposite direction. The importance\r\n  which the Greeks (probably not earlier than the second century of our\r\n  era) attached to these chains running from north to south, induced\r\n  Agathodæmon and Ptolemy (_Tab._ vii. et viii.) to regard the Bolor\r\n  under the name of Imaus as an axis of elevation, which extended as far\r\n  as 62° north latitude into the basin of the lower Irtysch and Obi.[CE]\r\n\r\n  As the vertical height of mountain summits above the sea’s level\r\n  (however unimportant the phenomenon of the more or less extensive\r\n  folding of the crust of a planetary sphere may be in the eyes of\r\n  geognosists) will always continue, like all that is difficult of\r\n  attainment, to be an object of general curiosity, the present would\r\n  appear to furnish a fitting place for the introduction of an\r\n  historical notice relative to the gradual advance of hypsometric\r\n  knowledge. When I returned to Europe in 1804, after an absence of four\r\n  years, not one of the high snow-crowned summits of Asia (in the\r\n  Himalaya, the Hindoo-Coosh, or the Caucasus) had been yet measured\r\n  with any degree of accuracy. I was unable, therefore, to compare my\r\n  determinations of the heights of perpetual snow in the Cordilleras of\r\n  Quito or the mountains of Mexico, with any results obtained in India.\r\n  The important travels of Turner, Davis, and Saunders to the highlands\r\n  of Thibet, were indeed accomplished in the year 1783; but the\r\n  intelligent Colebrooke justly observed that the height of the\r\n  Schamalari (28° 5′ north latitude, 89° 30′ east longitude, somewhat\r\n  north of Tassisudan), as given by Turner, rested on a foundation quite\r\n  as slight as the assumed measurements of the heights seen from Patna\r\n  and Kafiristan by Colonel Crawford and Lieutenant Macartney.[CF] The\r\n  admirable labours of Webb, Hodgson, Herbert, and the brothers Gerard,\r\n  have indeed thrown considerable light on the question concerning the\r\n  heights of the colossal summits of the Himalaya; but yet, in 1808, the\r\n  hypsometric knowledge of the East Indian mountain chains was still so\r\n  uncertain, that Webb wrote to Colebrooke, “The height of the Himalaya\r\n  still remains undetermined. It is true that I have ascertained that\r\n  the summits visible from the elevated plains of Rohilkand are 21,000\r\n  feet higher than that plateau, but we are ignorant of their absolute\r\n  height above the sea.”\r\n\r\n  In the year 1820 it first began to be currently reported in Europe\r\n  that there were not only much higher summits in the Himalaya than in\r\n  the Cordilleras, but that Webb had seen in the pass of Niti, and\r\n  Moorcroft in the Thibetian plateau of Daba, and the sacred lakes, fine\r\n  corn-fields and fertile pasturelands at elevations far exceeding the\r\n  height of Mont Blanc. This announcement was received in England with\r\n  great incredulity, and opposed by doubts regarding the influence of\r\n  the refraction of light. I have shown the unsoundness of such doubts\r\n  in two printed treatises on the mountains of India, in the _Annales de\r\n  Chimie et de Physique_. The Tyrolese Jesuit, Father Tiefenthaler, who\r\n  in 1766 penetrated as far as the provinces of Kemaun and Nepal, had\r\n  already divined the importance of the Dhawalagiri. We read on his map:\r\n  “_Montes Albi, qui Indis Dolaghir, nive obsiti_.” Captain Webb always\r\n  employs the same name. Until the measurements of the Djawahir (30° 22′\r\n  north latitude, and 79° 58′ east longitude, 26,902 feet in elevation),\r\n  and of the Dhawalagiri (28° 40′ north latitude, and 83° 21′ east\r\n  longitude, 28,072 feet in elevation), were made known in Europe, the\r\n  Chimborazo, which, according to my trigonometrical measurement, was\r\n  21,422 feet in height,[CG] was still everywhere regarded as the\r\n  loftiest summit on the earth. The Himalaya appeared, therefore, at\r\n  that time, to be 4323 feet or 6620 feet higher than the Cordilleras,\r\n  according as the comparison was made with the Djawahir or the\r\n  Dhawalagiri. Pentland’s South American travels, in the years 1827 and\r\n  1838, directed attention to two snow-crowned summits of Upper Peru,\r\n  east of the lake of Titicaca, which were conjectured to be\r\n  respectively 3824 and 2578 feet higher than the Chimborazo.[CH] It has\r\n  been already observed,[CI] that the most recent computations in the\r\n  measurements of the Sorata and Illimani have shown the error of this\r\n  hypsometric assertion. The Dhawalagiri, therefore, on whose declivity\r\n  in the river-valley of Ghandaki, the Salagrana Ammonites, so\r\n  celebrated in the Brahminical ritual as symbols of the testaceous\r\n  incarnation of Vishnu, are collected, still indicates a difference of\r\n  elevation between both continents of more than 6600 feet.\r\n\r\n  The question has been asked, whether there may not be still greater\r\n  heights in the rear of the southernmost chain, which has been as yet\r\n  measured with more or less exactitude. Colonel George Lloyd, who in\r\n  1840 edited the important observations of Captain Alexander Gerard and\r\n  his brother, entertains the opinion, that in that part of the\r\n  Himalaya, which he somewhat indefinitely names the “Tartaric Chain”\r\n  (and consequently in Northern Thibet, in the direction of the\r\n  Kuen-lün, perhaps in the Kailasa of the sacred lakes or beyond Leh)\r\n  there are mountain-summits which attain an elevation of from 29,000 to\r\n  30,000 feet, one or two thousand feet higher, therefore, than the\r\n  Dhawalagiri.[CJ] No definite opinion can be formed on the subject\r\n  until we are in the possession of actual measurements, since the\r\n  indication which led the natives of Quito, long before the arrival of\r\n  Bouguer and La Condamine, to regard the summit of the Chimborazo as\r\n  the culminating point—or the highest point within the region of\r\n  perpetual snow—is rendered very deceptive in the temperate zone of\r\n  Thibet, where the radiation of the table-land is so effective, and\r\n  where the lower limit of perpetual snow does not constitute a regular\r\n  line of equal level as in the tropics. The greatest elevation above\r\n  the level of the sea that has been reached by man on the sides of the\r\n  Himalaya is 19,488 feet. This elevation was gained by Captain Gerard,\r\n  with seven barometers, as we have already observed, on the mountain of\r\n  Tarhigang, somewhat to the north-west of Schipke.[CK] This happens to\r\n  be almost the same height as that to which I myself ascended up on the\r\n  Chimborazo (on the 23rd of June, 1802), and which was reached thirty\r\n  years later (16th of December, 1831) by my friend Boussingault. The\r\n  unattained summit of the Tarhigang is, moreover, 1255 feet higher than\r\n  the Chimborazo.\r\n\r\n  The passes across the Himalaya from Hindostan to Chinese Tartary, or\r\n  rather to Western Thibet, especially between the rivers Buspa and\r\n  Schipke, or Langzing Khampa, are from 15,347 to 18,544 feet in height.\r\n  In the chain of the Andes I found that the pass of Assuay, between\r\n  Quito and Cuenca, at the Ladera de Cadlud, was also fully 15,566 feet\r\n  above the level of the sea. A great part of the Alpine plains of the\r\n  interior of Asia would lie buried throughout the whole year in snow\r\n  and ice, if the limits of perpetual snow were not singularly elevated,\r\n  probably to about 16,626 feet, by the force of the heat radiated from\r\n  the Thibetian plain, the constant serenity of the sky, the rarity of\r\n  the formation of snow in the dry atmosphere, and by the powerful solar\r\n  heat peculiar to the eastern continental climate, which characterizes\r\n  the northern declivity of the Himalaya. Fields of barley (of _Hordeum\r\n  hexastichon_) have been seen in Kunawur at an elevation of 14,700 feet\r\n  and another variety of barley, called Ooa, and allied to _Hordeum\r\n  cœleste_, even much higher. Wheat thrives admirably well in the\r\n  Thibetian highlands, up to an elevation of 12,000 feet. On the\r\n  northern declivity of the Himalaya, Captain Gerard found that the\r\n  upper limits of the birch woods ascend to 14,069 feet; and small\r\n  brushwood used by the natives for fuel in their huts is even found\r\n  within the parallels of 30° 45′ and 31° north latitude, at an\r\n  elevation of 16,946 feet, and therefore nearly 1280 feet higher than\r\n  the lower snow-limit in the equatorial regions. It follows from the\r\n  data hitherto collected that on the northern declivity of the Himalaya\r\n  the mean of the lower snow-line is at least 16,626 feet, whilst on the\r\n  southern declivity it falls to 12,980 feet. But for this remarkable\r\n  distribution of heat in the upper strata of the atmosphere, the\r\n  mountain plain of Western Thibet would be rendered uninhabitable for\r\n  the millions of men who now occupy it.[CL]\r\n\r\n  In a letter which I have lately received from India from Dr. Joseph\r\n  Hooker, who is engaged in meteorological and geological observations,\r\n  as well as in the study of the geography of plants, he says, “Mr.\r\n  Hodgson, whom we here consider more thoroughly conversant than any\r\n  other geographer with the hypsometric relations of the snow ranges,\r\n  recognises the correctness of the opinions you have advanced in the\r\n  third part of your _Asie centrale_, regarding the cause of the unequal\r\n  height of the limit of perpetual snow on the northern and the southern\r\n  declivity of the Himalaya range. In the trans-Sutledge region (in 36°\r\n  north latitude) we often observed the snow limit as high as 20,000\r\n  feet, whilst in the passes south of Brahmaputra, between Assam and\r\n  Birmah (in 27° north latitude), where the most southern snow-capped\r\n  mountains of Asia are situated, the snow limit sinks to 15,000 feet.”\r\n  I believe we ought to distinguish between the extreme and the mean\r\n  elevations, but in both we find the formerly disputed difference\r\n  between the Thibetian and the Indian declivities manifested in the\r\n  clearest manner.\r\n\r\n My result for the mean height of    Extremes according to Dr. Hooker’s\r\n   the snow line as given in _Asie     Letter.\r\n   centrale_, t. iii., p. 326.\r\n                              Feet.

Alexander\r\n  Gerard saw the snow-limit ascend to 20,463 feet on the Thibetian\r\n  declivity of the Himalaya; and Jacquemont found it as low as 11,500\r\n  feet on the south-Indian declivity, north of Cursali on the Jumnautri.\r\n\r\n  [The recent investigations of Lieutenant Strachey show that M.\r\n  Humboldt has been led astray, when treating of the Himalaya, by the\r\n  very authorities on whom he placed the most reliance. The results of\r\n  his inquiries on this point are given in the first volume of the\r\n  COSMOS (Bohn’s Ed.), pp. 9 and 338. As the subject is one of\r\n  considerable interest we give a brief sketch of Lieutenant\r\n  Strachey’s[CM] recent labours, confining ourselves to his own views,\r\n  and omitting (for want of space) his somewhat lengthy exposition of\r\n  the errors committed by the authorities quoted by Humboldt. The\r\n  following are his personal observations regarding the _southern limit\r\n  of the belt of perpetual snow_.\r\n\r\n  “In this part of the Himalaya it is not, on an average of years, till\r\n  the beginning of December, that the snow line appears decidedly to\r\n  descend for the winter. After the end of September, indeed, when the\r\n  rains are quite over, light falls of snow are not of very uncommon\r\n  occurrence on the higher mountains, even down to 12,000 feet; but\r\n  their effects usually disappear very quickly, often in a few hours.\r\n  The latter part of October, the whole of November, and the beginning\r\n  of December, are here generally characterised by the beautiful\r\n  serenity of the sky; and it is at this season, on the southern edge of\r\n  the belt, that the line of perpetual snow is seen to attain its\r\n  greatest elevation.\r\n\r\n  “The following are the results of trigonometrical measurements of the\r\n  elevation of the inferior edge of snow on spurs of the Treslú and\r\n  Nandádevi groups of peaks, made, before the winter snow had begun, in\r\n  November, 1848.\r\n\r\n ┌─────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────┐\r\n │         │                                            │Height on face│\r\n │  Point  │ Height as observed on face exposed to the  │  exposed to  │\r\n │observed.│                   East.                    │West.

The dip of the strata being to the north-east, the faces\r\n  exposed to view from the south are for the most part very abrupt, and\r\n  snow never accumulates on them to any great extent. This in some\r\n  measure will account for the height to which the snow is seen to have\r\n  receded on the eastern exposures, that is, upwards of 17,000 feet. On\r\n  the western exposures the ground is less steep, and the snow is seen\r\n  to have been observed at a considerable less elevation; but it was in\r\n  very small quantities, and had probably fallen lately, so that I am\r\n  inclined to think that its height, viz., about 15,000 feet, rather\r\n  indicates the elevation below which the light autumnal falls of snow\r\n  were incapable of lying, than that of the inferior edge of the\r\n  perpetual snow. It is further to be understood, that below this level\r\n  of 15,000 feet the mountains were absolutely without snow, excepting\r\n  those small isolated patches that are seen in ravines, or at the head\r\n  of glaciers, which, of course, do not affect such calculations as\r\n  these. On the whole, therefore, I consider that the height of the\r\n  snow-line on the more prominent points of the southern edge of the\r\n  belt may be fairly reckoned at 16,000 feet at the very least.\r\n\r\n  “The point No. 4 was selected as being in a much more retired position\r\n  than the others. It is situate not far from the head of the Pindur\r\n  river. It was quite free from snow at 15,300 feet, and I shall\r\n  therefore consider 15,000 feet as the elevation of the snow-line in\r\n  the re-entering angles of the chain.\r\n\r\n  “I conclude, then, that 15,500 feet, the mean of the heights at the\r\n  most and least prominent points, should be assigned as the mean\r\n  elevation of the snow-line at the southern limit of the belt of\r\n  perpetual snow in Kumaon; and I conceive that whatever error there may\r\n  be in this estimate will be found to lie on the side of diminution\r\n  rather than of exaggeration.\r\n\r\n  “This result appears to accord well with what has been observed in the\r\n  Bissehir range. The account given by Dr. Gerard of his visit to the\r\n  Shátúl Pass on this range, which he undertook expressly for the\r\n  purpose of determining the height of the snow-line, contains the only\r\n  definite information as to the limit of the perpetual snow at the\r\n  southern edge of the belt that is to be found in the whole of the\r\n  published writings of the Gerards; and the following is a short\r\n  abstract of his observations. Dr. Gerard reached the summit of the\r\n  Shátúl Pass, the elevation of which is 15,500 feet, on the 9th of\r\n  August, 1822, and remained there till the 15th of the same month. He\r\n  found the southern slope of the range generally free from snow, and he\r\n  states that it is sometimes left without any whatever. On the top of\r\n  the pass itself there was no snow; but on the northern slope of the\r\n  mountain it lay as far down as about 14,000 feet. On his arrival rain\r\n  was falling, and out of the four days of his stay on this pass it\r\n  either rained or snowed for the greater part of three. The fresh snow\r\n  that fell during this time did not lie below 16,000 feet, and some of\r\n  the more precipitous rocks remained clear even up to 17,000 feet.\r\n\r\n  “The conclusion to which Dr. Gerard comes from these facts is, that\r\n  the snow-line on the southern face of the Bissehir range is at 15,000\r\n  feet above the sea. But I should myself be more inclined, from his\r\n  account, to consider that 15,500 feet was nearer the truth; and in\r\n  this view I am confirmed by verbal accounts of the state of the passes\r\n  on this range, which I have obtained from persons of my acquaintance,\r\n  who have crossed them somewhat later in the year. The difference,\r\n  however, is after all trifling.\r\n\r\n  “Such is the direct evidence that can be offered on the height of the\r\n  snow-line at the southern limit of the belt of perpetual snow: some\r\n  additional light, may, however, be thrown on the subject generally by\r\n  my shortly explaining the state in which I have found the higher parts\r\n  of the mountains at the different seasons during which I have visited\r\n  them.\r\n\r\n  “In the beginning of May, on the mountains to the east of the Rámganga\r\n  river, near Námik, I found the ground on the summit of the ridge,\r\n  called Champwá, not only perfectly free from snow at an elevation of\r\n  12,000 feet, but covered with flowers, in some places golden with\r\n  calsha and ranunculus polypetalus, in others purple with primulus. The\r\n  snow had in fact already receded to upwards of 12,500 feet, behind\r\n  which even a few little gentians proclaimed the advent of spring.\r\n\r\n  “Towards the end of the same month, at the end of the Pindur, near the\r\n  glacier from which that river rises, an open spot on which I could\r\n  pitch my tent could not be found above 12,000 feet. But here the\r\n  accumulation of snow, which was considerable in all ravines even below\r\n  11,000 feet, is manifestly the result of avalanches and drift. The\r\n  surface of the glacier, clear ice as well as moraines, was quite free\r\n  from snow up to nearly 13,000 feet; but the effect of the more retired\r\n  position of the place in retarding the melting of the snow, was\r\n  manifest from the less advanced state of the vegetation. During my\r\n  stay at Pinduri the weather was very bad, and several inches of snow\r\n  fell; but, excepting where it had fallen on the old snow, it all\r\n  melted off again in a few hours, even without the assistance of the\r\n  sun’s direct rays. On the glacier, at 13,000 feet, it had all\r\n  disappeared twelve hours after it fell.\r\n\r\n  “On revisiting Pinduri about the middle of October, the change that\r\n  had taken place was very striking. Now not a sign of snow was to be\r\n  seen on any part of the road up to the very head of the glacier; a\r\n  luxuriant vegetation had sprung up, but had already almost entirely\r\n  perished, and its remains covered the ground as far as I went. From\r\n  this elevation, about 13,000 feet, evident signs of vegetation could\r\n  be seen to extend far up the less precipitous mountains. The place is\r\n  not one at which the height of the perpetual snow can be easily\r\n  estimated, for on all sides are glaciers, and the vast accumulations\r\n  of snow from which they are supplied, and these cannot always be\r\n  readily distinguished from snow _in situ_; but as far as I could\r\n  judge, those places which might be considered as offering a fair\r\n  criterion were free from snow up to 15,000, or even 16,000 feet.\r\n\r\n  “Towards the end of August I crossed the Barjikang Pass, between Rálam\r\n  and Juhár, the elevation of which is about 15,300 feet. There was here\r\n  no vestige of snow on the ascent to the pass from the south-east, and\r\n  only a very small patch remained on the north-western face. The view\r\n  of the continuation of the ridge in a southerly direction was cut off\r\n  by a prominent point, but no snow lay on that side within 500 feet of\r\n  the pass, while to the north I estimated that there was no snow in\r\n  considerable quantity within 1500 feet or more, that is, nearly up to\r\n  17,000 feet. The vegetation on the very summit of the pass was far\r\n  from scanty, though it had already begun to break up into tufts, and\r\n  had lost that character of continuity which it had maintained to\r\n  within a height of 500 or 600 feet. Species of Potentilla, Sedum,\r\n  Saxifraga, Corydalis, Aconitum, Delphinium, Thalictrum, Ranunculus\r\n  Saussurea, Gentiana, Pedicularis, Primula, Rheum, and Polygonum, all\r\n  evidently flourishing in a congenial climate, showed that the limits\r\n  of vegetation and region of perpetual snow were still far distant.\r\n\r\n  “In addition to these facts, it may not be out of place to mention\r\n  that there are two mountains visible from Almorah, Rigoli-gúdri, in\r\n  Garhwal between the Kailganga and Nandákni, and Chipula, in Kumaon,\r\n  between the Gori and Dauli (of Darma), both upwards of 13,000 feet in\r\n  elevation, from the summits of which the snow disappears long before\r\n  the end of the summer months, and which do not usually again become\r\n  covered for the winter till late in December.”\r\n\r\n  These remarks are followed by an exposition of the errors into which\r\n  Webb, Colebrooke, Hodgson, A. Gerard, and Jacquemont, have fallen. The\r\n  heights assigned by these travellers “must all be rejected; nor can it\r\n  be considered at all surprising that any amount of mistake, as to the\r\n  height of the snow-line, should be made, so long as travellers cannot\r\n  distinguish snow from glacier ice, or look for the boundary of\r\n  perpetual snow at the beginning of the spring.”\r\n\r\n  With regard to _the northern limit of the belt of perpetual snow_,\r\n  Lieutenant Strachey’s observations were made in September, 1848, on\r\n  his way from Milam into Hundes, _viâ_ Unta-dhúra, Kyungar-ghát, and\r\n  Balch-dhúra, at the beginning of the month; and on his road back\r\n  again, _viâ_ Lakhur-ghát, at the end of the month.\r\n\r\n  “Of the three passes that we crossed on our way from Milam, all of\r\n  them being about 17,000 feet in elevation, the first is Wata-dhára,\r\n  and we saw no snow on any part of the way up to its top, which was\r\n  reached in a very disagreeable drizzle of rain and snow. The final\r\n  ascent to the pass from the south is about 1000 feet. The path leads\r\n  up the side of a ravine, down which a small stream trickles, the\r\n  ground having a generally even and rounded surface. Neither on any\r\n  part of this nor on the summit of the pass itself, which is tolerably\r\n  level, were there any remains of snow whatever. On the ridge to the\r\n  right and left there were patches of snow a few hundred feet above;\r\n  and on the northern face of the pass an accumulation remained that\r\n  extended about 200 feet down, apparently the effect of the drift\r\n  through the gap in which the pass lies. Below this again the ground\r\n  was everywhere quite free from snow. On the ascent to Wata-dhára, at\r\n  perhaps 17,000 feet, a few blades of grass were seen, but on the whole\r\n  it may be said to have been utterly devoid of vegetation. On the north\r\n  side of the pass, 300 or 400 feet below the summit, a cruciferous\r\n  plant was the first met with.\r\n\r\n  “The Kyungar pass, which is four or six miles north of Wata-dhára, was\r\n  found equally free from snow on its southern face and summit, which\r\n  latter is particularly open and level. The mountains on either side\r\n  were also free from snow to some height; but on the north a large bed\r\n  lay a little way down the slope, and extended to about 500 feet from\r\n  the top. On this pass a boragineous plant in flower was found above\r\n  17,000 feet; a species of _Urtica_ was also got about the same\r\n  altitude, and we afterwards saw it again nearly as high up on the\r\n  Lakhur pass.\r\n\r\n  “In our ascent to the Balch pass no snow was observed on any of the\r\n  southern spires of the range, and only one or two very small patches\r\n  could be seen from the summit on the north side. The average height of\r\n  the top of this range can hardly be more than 500 feet greater than\r\n  that of the pass; and as a whole it certainly does not enter the\r\n  region of perpetual snow. As viewed from the plains of Handes, it\r\n  cannot be said to appear snowy, a few only of the peaks being tipped.\r\n\r\n  “We returned to Milam _viâ_ Chirchun. The whole of the ascent to The\r\n  Lakhur pass was perfectly free from snow to the very top, _i.e._\r\n  18,300 feet, and many of the neighbouring mountains were bare still\r\n  higher. The next ridge on this route is Jainti-dhára, which is passed\r\n  at an elevation of 18,500 feet, but still without crossing the least\r\n  portion of snow. The line of perpetual snow is however evidently near;\r\n  for though the Jainti ridge was quite free, and some of the peaks near\r\n  us were clear probably to upwards of 19,000 feet, yet in more\r\n  sheltered situations unbroken snow could be seen considerably below\r\n  us; and on the whole I think that 18,500 feet must be near the average\r\n  height of the snow-line at this place.”\r\n\r\n  A brief recapitulation of the principal results of Lieutenant\r\n  Strachey’s inquiries shows us that “the snow-line or the southern edge\r\n  of the belt of perpetual snow in this portion of the Himalaya is at an\r\n  elevation of 15,000 feet, while on the northern edge it reaches 18,500\r\n  feet; and that on the mountains to the north of the Sutlej, or still\r\n  further, it recedes even beyond 19,000 feet. The greater elevation\r\n  which the snow-line attains on the northern edge of the belt of\r\n  perpetual snow is a phenomenon not confined to the Thibetan declivity\r\n  alone, but extending far into the interior of the chain; and it\r\n  appears to be caused by the quantity of snow that falls on the\r\n  northern portion of the mountains being much less than that which\r\n  falls farther to the south along the line where the peaks, covered\r\n  with perpetual snow, first rise above the less elevated ranges of the\r\n  Himalaya.”\r\n\r\n  The letters of Dr. Joseph Hooker published during the present year\r\n  (1849) in the _Athenæum_ (pp. 431 and 1039) may also be consulted with\r\n  advantage.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  p. 5—“_A tawny tribe of Herdsmen_.”\r\n\r\n  The Hiongnu (Hioung-nou), whom Deguignes and with him many other\r\n  historians long believed to be identical with the Huns, inhabited the\r\n  vast Tartarian tract of land which is bordered on the east by\r\n  Uo-leang-ho, the present territory of the Mant-schu, on the south by\r\n  the Chinese wall, on the west by the U-siün, and on the north by the\r\n  land of the Eleuthes But the Hiongnu belong to the Turkish, and the\r\n  Huns to the Finnish or Uralian race. The _northern_ Huns, a rude\r\n  people of herdsmen, unacquainted with agriculture, were of a blackish\r\n  brown complexion. The _southern_ Huns, or Hajatehah called by the\r\n  Byzantines Euthalites or Nephthalites, and inhabiting the eastern\r\n  shore of the Caspian Sea, had fairer skins. These pursued agriculture,\r\n  and dwelt in towns. They are frequently termed _White Huns_, and\r\n  d’Herbelot even regards them as Indo-Scythians. In Deguignes[CN] an\r\n  account will be found of the Punu, the leader or Tanju of the Huns,\r\n  and of the great drought and famine which led to the migration of a\r\n  portion of the nation northwards about the year 46 A.D. All the\r\n  details, given in his celebrated work regarding the Hiongnu, have been\r\n  recently submitted by Klaproth to a rigid and learned scrutiny. From\r\n  the result of his investigations it would appear, that the Hiongnu\r\n  belong to the widely diffused Turkish races of the Altai and Tangnu\r\n  mountain districts. The name of Hiongnu was a general name for the Ti,\r\n  Thu-kiu or Turks, in the north and north-west of China, even in the\r\n  third century before the Christian era. The southern Hiongnu submitted\r\n  themselves to the Chinese, and in conjunction with the latter\r\n  destroyed the empire of the northern Hiongnu, who were in consequence\r\n  compelled to flee to the west, and thus appear to have given the first\r\n  impulse to the migration of nations in Central Asia. The Huns, who\r\n  were long confounded with the Hiongnu (as the Uigures were with the\r\n  Ugures and Hungarians) belonged, according to Klaproth,[CO] to the\r\n  Finnish race of the Uralian mountains, which race has been variously\r\n  intermixed with Germans, Turks, and Samoiedes.\r\n\r\n  The Huns (Οὖννοι) are first mentioned by Dionysius Periegetes, a\r\n  writer who was able to obtain more accurate information than others\r\n  regarding the interior of Asia, because, as a learned man and a native\r\n  of Charax on the Arabian Gulf, he was sent back to the East by\r\n  Augustus, to accompany thither his adopted son, Caius Agrippa.\r\n  Ptolemy, a century later, writes the word Χοῦνοι with a strong\r\n  aspiration, which, as St. Martin observes, is again met with in the\r\n  geographical name of Chunigard.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  p. 6—“_No hewn stone_.”\r\n\r\n  Representations of the sun and figures of animals have certainly been\r\n  found graven in rocks on the banks of the Orinoco, near Caicara, where\r\n  the woody region borders on the plain, but in the Llanos themselves\r\n  not a trace of these rough memorials of earlier inhabitants has ever\r\n  been discovered. It is to be regretted that no accurate account has\r\n  reached us of a monument which was sent to Count Maurepas, in France,\r\n  and which, according to Kalm, was discovered in the prairies of\r\n  Canada, 900 French leagues (about 2700 English miles) west of\r\n  Montreal, by M. de Verandrier, while engaged on an expedition to the\r\n  coast of the Pacific Ocean.[CP] This traveller met in the plains with\r\n  huge masses of stone erected by the hand of man, on one of which there\r\n  was an inscription believed to be in the Tartar language[CQ]. How can\r\n  so important a monument have remained uninvestigated? Can it actually\r\n  have borne an alphabetical inscription, or are we not rather to\r\n  believe that it must have been an historical picture, like the\r\n  so-called Phœnician inscription, which has been discovered on the bank\r\n  of the Taunton river, and whose authenticity has been questioned by\r\n  Court de Gebelin? I indeed regard it as highly probable that these\r\n  plains were once traversed by civilised nations, and it seems to me\r\n  that this fact is proved by the existence of pyramidal grave-works or\r\n  burrows and bulwarks of extraordinary length, between the Rocky\r\n  Mountains and the Alleghanys, on which Squier and Davis have now\r\n  thrown new light in their account of the ancient monuments of the\r\n  Mississippi valley.[CR] M. de Verandrier was despatched, about the\r\n  year 1746, on this expedition by the Chevalier de Beauharnois,\r\n  Governor-General of Canada; and several Jesuits in Quebec assured Kalm\r\n  that they had actually had this so-called inscription in their hands,\r\n  and that it was graven on a small tablet which was found inlaid in a\r\n  hewn pillar. I have in vain requested several of my friends in France\r\n  to make inquiries regarding this monument, in the event of its being\r\n  in the Collection of Count Maurepas. I have also found equally\r\n  uncertain accounts of the alphabetical writing of the American\r\n  aboriginal races, in a work of Pedro de Cieça de Leon,[CS] in\r\n  Garcia,[CT] and in Columbus’s[CU] journal of his first voyage. M. de\r\n  Verandrier maintained also that traces of the ploughshare were\r\n  observed for days together in travelling over the grassy plains of\r\n  Western Canada; a circumstance that other travellers, prior to him,\r\n  likewise profess to have noticed. But the utter ignorance of the\r\n  primitive nations of North America regarding this implement of\r\n  agriculture, the want of beasts of draught, and the vast extent of\r\n  surface over which these tracks extend through the prairie, tend\r\n  rather to make me adopt the opinion that this singular appearance of\r\n  furrows is owing to some movement of water over the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  p. 6—“_It spreads like an arm of the sea_.”\r\n\r\n  The great steppe, which extends from the mouth of the Orinoco to the\r\n  snowy mountains of Merida, from east to west, deflects towards the\r\n  south in the parallel of 8° north latitude, and occupies the whole\r\n  space between the eastern declivity of the elevated mountains of New\r\n  Granada and the Orinoco, which here flows in a northerly direction.\r\n  That portion of the Llanos, which is watered by the Meta, Vichada,\r\n  Zama, and Guaviare, connects as it were the valley of the Amazon with\r\n  that of the Lower Orinoco. The word _Paramo_, which I have frequently\r\n  employed in this work, signifies in the Spanish colonies all alpine\r\n  regions which are situated from 11,000 to 14,000 feet above the level\r\n  of the sea, and whose climate is rude, ungenial, and misty. In the\r\n  higher Paramos hail and snow fall daily for many hours continuously,\r\n  and yield a beneficial supply of humidity to the alpine plants, not\r\n  from the absolute quantity of vapour in the higher strata of the air,\r\n  but by the frequency of the aqueous deposits occasioned by the rapidly\r\n  changing currents of air, and the variations of the electric tension.\r\n  The trees found in these regions are low, and spread out in an\r\n  umbrella-like form, have gnarled branches, which are constantly\r\n  covered with fresh and evergreen foliage. They are mostly\r\n  large-flowering laurel and myrtle-leaved alpine shrubs _Escallonia\r\n  tubar_, _Escallonia myrtilloides_, _Chuquiraga insignis_, _Araliæ_,\r\n  _Weinmanniæ_, _Frezieræ_, _Gualtheriæ_, and _Andromeda reticulata_,\r\n  may be regarded as the representatives of the physiognomy of this\r\n  vegetation.[CV] To the south of the town of Santa Fé de Bogota lies\r\n  the celebrated _Paramo de la Suma Paz_, an isolated mountain group, in\r\n  which, according to Indian legends, great treasures are concealed; and\r\n  hence issues a small stream or brook, which pours its foaming waters\r\n  through a remarkable natural bridge in the rocky ravine of Icononzo.\r\n\r\n  In my Latin treatise, _De Distributione geographica Plantarum secundum\r\n  cœli temperiem et altitudinem montium_, 1817, p. 104, I have thus\r\n  endeavoured to characterise these Alpine regions: “Altitudine\r\n  1700–1900 hexapod: asperriæ solitudines, quæ a colonis hispanis uno\r\n  nomine _Paramos_ appellantur, tempestatum vicissitudinibus mire\r\n  obnoxiæ, ad quas solutæ et emollitæ defluunt nives; ventorum flatibus\r\n  ac nimborum grandinisque jactu tumultuosa regio, quæ æque per diem et\r\n  per noctes riget, solis nubila et tristi luce fere nunquam calefacta.\r\n  Habitantur in hac ipsa altitudine sat magnæ civitates, ut Micuipampa\r\n  Peruvianorum, ubi thermometrum centes. meridie inter 5° et 8°, noctu\r\n  –0°.4 consistere vidi; Huancavelica, propter cinnabaris venas\r\n  celebrata, ubi altitudine 1835 hexap. fere totum per annum temperies\r\n  mensis Martii Parisiis.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  p. 6—“_The Cordilleras of Cochabamba and the Brazilian mountains\r\n  approximate to one another by means of separate transverse chains_.”\r\n\r\nThe immense space between the eastern coasts of South America and the\r\neastern declivity of the chain of the Andes is contracted by two\r\nmountain masses, which partially separate from one another the three\r\nvalleys or plains of the Lower Orinoco, the Amazon, and the Rio de la\r\nPlata. The more northern mountain mass, called the group of the Parime,\r\nis opposite to the Andes of Cundinamarca, which, after extending far\r\ntowards the east, assume the form of one elevated mountain, between the\r\nparallels of 66° and 68° west longitude. It is connected by the narrow\r\nmountain ridge of Pacaraima with the granitic hills of French Guiana, as\r\nI have clearly indicated in the map of Columbia which I drew up from my\r\nown astronomical observations. The Caribs, in their long expeditions\r\nfrom the missions of Carony to the plains of Rio Branco, and even to the\r\nBrazilian frontier, are obliged to traverse the crests of Pacaraima and\r\nQuimiropaca. The second group of mountains, which separates the valley\r\nof the Amazon from that of La Plata, is the Brazilian, which\r\napproximates to the promontory of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, in the\r\nprovince of Chiquitos, west of the Parecis hills. As neither the group\r\nof the Parime, which gives rise to the cataracts of the Orinoco, nor the\r\nBrazilian group, is directly connected with the chain of the Andes, the\r\nplains of Venezuela and those of Patagonia are directly connected with\r\none another.[CW]\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\np. 6—“_Herds of wild dogs_.”\r\n\r\nIn the Pampas of Buenos Ayres the traveller meets with European dogs,\r\nwhich have become wild. They live gregariously in holes and excavations,\r\nin which they conceal their young. When the horde becomes too numerous,\r\nseveral families go forth, and form new settlements elsewhere. The\r\nEuropean dog barks as loudly after it has become wild, as does the\r\nindigenous American hairy species. Garcilaso asserts that, prior to the\r\narrival of the Spaniards, the Peruvians had a race of dogs called\r\n_Perros gozques_; and he calls the indigenous dog _Allco_. In order to\r\ndistinguish this animal from the European variety, it is called in the\r\nQuichua language Runa-allco, Indian dog, or dog of the natives. The\r\nhairy Runa-allco appears to be a mere variety of the shepherd’s dog. It\r\nis, however, smaller, has long yellow-ochry coloured hair, is marked\r\nwith white and brown spots, and has erect and pointed ears. It barks\r\ncontinually, but seldom bites the natives, however it may attack the\r\nwhites. When the Inca Pachacutec, in his religious wars, conquered the\r\nIndians of Xauxa and Huanca (the present valley of Huancaya and Jauja),\r\nand compelled them by force to submit to the worship of the sun, he\r\nfound that dogs were made the objects of their adoration, and that the\r\npriests used the skulls of these animals as wind instruments. It would\r\nalso appear that the flesh of this canine divinity was eaten by the\r\nbelievers.[CX] The veneration of dogs in the valley of the Huancaya is\r\nprobably the reason why the skulls, and even whole mummies, of these\r\nanimals are sometimes found in the Huacas, or Peruvian graves of the\r\nmost ancient period. Von Tschudi, the author of an admirable treatise on\r\nthe _Fauna Peruana_, has examined these skulls, and believes them to\r\nbelong to a peculiar species, which he calls _Canis ingæ_, and which is\r\ndifferent from the European dog. The Huancas are still, in derision,\r\ncalled “dog-eaters” by the inhabitants of other provinces. Among the\r\nnatives of the Rocky Mountains of North America, cooked dog’s flesh is\r\nplaced before the stranger guest, as a feast of honour. Captain Frémont\r\nwas present at such a dog-feast in the neighbourhood of Fort Laramie,\r\nwhich is one of the stations of the Hudson’s Bay Company for trading in\r\nskins and peltries with the Sioux Indians.[CY]\r\n\r\nThe Peruvian dogs were made to play a singular part during eclipses of\r\nthe moon, being beaten as long as the darkness continued. The Mexican\r\n_Techichi_, a variety of the common dog, which was called in Anahuac\r\n_Chichi_, was the only completely dumb dog. The literal signification of\r\nthe word _Techichi_ is “stone-dog,” from the Aztec, _tetl_, a stone.\r\nThis dog was eaten according to the ancient Chinese custom, and the\r\nSpaniards found this food so indispensable before the introduction of\r\nhorned cattle, that the race was gradually almost entirely\r\nextirpated.[CZ] Buffon confounds the Techichi with the Koupara of\r\nGuiana,[DA] which is, however, identical with the Procyon or _Ursus\r\ncancrivorus_, the _Raton crabier_, or the crab-eating Aguara-guaza of\r\nthe coasts of Patagonia.[DB] Linnæus, on the other hand, confounds the\r\ndumb dog with the Mexican _Itzcuintepotzotli_, a canine species which\r\nhas not hitherto been perfectly described, and which is said to be\r\ncharacterised by a short tail, a very small head, and a large hump on\r\nthe back. The name signifies a hump-backed dog, and is derived from the\r\nAztec _itzcuintli_, another word for dog, and _tepotzotli_, humped or a\r\nhumpback. I was much struck in America, especially in Quito and Peru,\r\nwith the great number of black hairless dogs. They are termed _Chiens\r\nturcs_ by Buffon, and are the _Canis ægyptius_ of Linnæus. This species\r\nis common amongst the Indians, who, however, generally despise them, and\r\ntreat them ill. All European dogs multiply rapidly in South America; and\r\nif no species are to be met with equal to those of Europe, it is partly\r\nowing to want of care, and partly to the circumstance that the finest\r\nvarieties (as the elegant greyhound and the Danish tiger breed) have\r\nnever been introduced.\r\n\r\nVon Tschudi makes the singular remark, that on the Cordilleras, at\r\nelevations of more than 12,000 feet, delicate breeds of dogs and the\r\nEuropean domestic cat are exposed to a particular kind of mortal\r\ndisease. “Innumerable attempts have been made to keep cats as domestic\r\nanimals in the town of Cerro de Pasco (lying at an elevation of 14,100\r\nfeet above the sea’s level); but such endeavours have invariably been\r\nfrustrated, as both cats and dogs have died in convulsions at the end of\r\na few days. The cats, after being attacked by convulsive fits, attempt\r\nto climb the walls, but soon fall to the ground exhausted and\r\nmotionless. I frequently observed instances in Yauli of this chorea-like\r\ndisease; and it seems to arise from insufficient atmospheric pressure.”\r\nIn the Spanish colonies, the hairless dog, which is called _Perro\r\nchinesco_, or _chino_, is supposed to be of Chinese origin, and to have\r\nbeen brought from Canton, or from Manila. According to Klaproth, the\r\nrace has been very common in the Chinese Empire from the earliest ages\r\nof its culture. Among the animals indigenous to Mexico, there was a very\r\nlarge, totally hairless, and dog-like wolf, named _Xoloitzcuintli_, from\r\nthe Mexican _xolo_ or _xolotl_, a servant or slave.[DC]\r\n\r\nThe result of Tschudi’s observations regarding the American indigenous\r\nraces of dogs are as follows:—There are two varieties almost\r\nspecifically different—1. The _Canis caraibicus_ of Lesson, totally\r\nhairless, with the exception of a small tuft of white hair on the\r\nforehead and at the tip of the tail; of a slate-gray colour, and without\r\nvoice. This variety was found by Columbus in the Antilles, by Cortes in\r\nMexico, and by Pizarro in Peru (where it suffers from the cold of the\r\nCordilleras); and it is still very frequently met with in the warmer\r\ndistricts of Peru, under the name of _Perros chinos_. 2. The _Canis\r\ningæ_, which belongs to the barking species, and has a pointed nose and\r\npointed ears; it is now used for watching sheep and cattle; it exhibits\r\nmany variations of colour, induced by being crossed with European\r\nbreeds. The _Canis ingæ_ follows man up the heights of the Cordilleras.\r\nIn the old Peruvian graves, the skeleton of this dog is sometimes found\r\nresting at the feet of the human mummy, presenting an emblem of fidelity\r\nfrequently employed by the mediæval sculptors.[DD] European dogs, that\r\nhad become wild, were found in the island of St. Domingo, and in Cuba,\r\nin the early periods of the Spanish conquest.[DE] In the savannahs\r\nbetween the Meta, Arauca, and Apure, dumb dogs (_perros mudos_) were\r\nused as food as late as the sixteenth century. The natives called them\r\n_Majos_ or _Auries_, says Alonzo de Herrera, who undertook an expedition\r\nto the Orinoco, in 1535. The highly intelligent traveller Gisecke found\r\nthis variety of non-barking dogs in Greenland. The dogs of the Esquimaux\r\nlive entirely in the open air, scraping for themselves at night holes in\r\nthe snow, and howling like wolves, in concert with one of the troop, who\r\nsits in the middle, and takes the lead in the chorus. The Mexican dogs\r\nwere castrated, in order that their flesh might become more fat and\r\ndelicate. On the borders of the province of Durango, and further north,\r\nnear the Slave Lake, the natives load the larger dogs with their\r\nbuffalo-skin tents, (at all events they did so formerly,) when, on the\r\nchange of seasons, they seek a different place of abode. These various\r\ndetails may all be regarded as characteristic of the mode of life led by\r\nthe nations of Eastern Asia.[DF]\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\np. 7—“_Like the greater part of the Desert of Sahara, the Llanos lie\r\nwithin the Torrid Zone_.”\r\n\r\nSignificant denominations, particularly such as refer to the form of the\r\nearth’s surface, and which arose at a period when there was only very\r\nuncertain information respecting different regions and their hypsometric\r\nrelations, have led to various and long-continued geographical errors.\r\nThe ancient Ptolemaic denomination of the “Greater and Lesser Atlas”[DG]\r\nhas exercised the injurious influence here indicated. There is no doubt\r\nthat the snow-covered western summits of the Atlas of Morocco may be\r\nregarded as the Great Atlas of Ptolemy; but where is the limit of the\r\nLittle Atlas? Are we still to maintain the division into two Atlas\r\nchains (which the conservative tendency of geographers has retained for\r\n1700 years) in the territory of Algiers, and even between Tunis and\r\nTlemse? Are we to seek a Greater and a Lesser Atlas between the coast\r\nand the parallel chains of the interior? All travellers familiar with\r\ngeognostic views, who have visited Algeria since it has been in the\r\npossession of the French, contest the meaning conveyed by the generally\r\nadopted nomenclature. Among the parallel chains, that of Jurjura is\r\ngenerally supposed to be the highest of those which have been measured;\r\nbut the well-informed Fournel (who was long _Ingénieur en chef des Mines\r\nde l’Algérie_) affirms that the mountain range of Aurès, near Batnah,\r\nwhich even at the end of March was found covered with snow, has a\r\ngreater elevation. Fournel contests the existence of a Little and a\r\nGreat Atlas, as I do that of a Little and a Great Altai[DH]. There is\r\nbut one Atlas, formerly called Dyris by the Mauritanians, “a name that\r\nmust be applied to the foldings (_rides_, _suites de crêtes_), which\r\nform the division between the waters flowing to the Mediterranean and\r\ntowards the lowland of the Sahara.” The lofty Atlas chain of Morocco\r\ninclines from north-east to south-west, and not, like the Eastern\r\nMauritanian portion of the Atlas, from east to west. It rises into\r\nsummits which, according to Renou, attain an elevation of 11,400 feet,\r\nexceeding, therefore, the height of Etna[DI]. A singularly formed\r\nhighland, of an almost square shape (Sahab el-Marga), is situated in 33°\r\nnorth lat., and is bounded to the south by high elevations. From thence\r\nthe Atlas declines in height in a westerly direction towards the sea,\r\nabout a degree south of Mogador. This south-western portion bears the\r\nname of Idrar-N-Deren.\r\n\r\nThe northern boundaries of the extended low region of the Sahara in\r\nMauritania, as well as its southern limits towards the fertile Sudan,\r\nhave hitherto been but imperfectly investigated. If we take the\r\nparallels of 16½° and 32½° north lat. as the outer limits, we obtain for\r\nthe Desert, including its oases, an area of more than 1,896,000 square\r\nmiles; or between nine and ten times the extent of Germany, and almost\r\nthree times that of the Mediterranean, exclusive of the Black Sea. The\r\nbest and most recent intelligence, for which we are indebted to the\r\nFrench observers, Colonel Daumas, and MM. Fournel, Renou, and Carette,\r\nshows us that the Desert of Sahara is composed of several detached\r\nbasins, and that the number and the population of the fertile Oases is\r\nvery much greater than had been imagined from the awfully desert\r\ncharacter of the country between Insalah and Timbuctoo, and the road\r\nfrom Mourzouk, in Fezzan, to Bilma, Tirtuma, and Lake Tschad. It is now\r\ngenerally affirmed that the sand covers only the smaller portion of the\r\nlowlands. A similar opinion had been previously advanced by my Siberian\r\ntravelling companion, the acute observer Ehrenberg, from what he had\r\nhimself seen[DJ]. Of larger wild animals, only gazelles, wild asses, and\r\nostriches are to be met with.\r\n\r\n“That lions exist in the desert,” says M. Carette, “is a myth\r\npopularised by the dreams of artists and poets, and has no foundation\r\nbut in their imagination. This animal does not quit the mountains where\r\nit finds shelter, food, and drink. When the traveller questions the\r\nnatives concerning these wild beasts, which Europeans suppose to be\r\ntheir companions in the desert, they reply, with imperturbable _sang\r\nfroid_, ‘Have you, then, lions in your country which can drink air and\r\neat leaves? With us lions require running water and living flesh; and\r\ntherefore they only appear where there are wooded hills and water. We\r\nfear only the viper (_lefa_), and, in humid spots, the innumerable\r\nswarms of mosquitoes which abound there.[DK]’”\r\n\r\nWhile Dr. Oudney, in his long journey from Tripoli to Lake Tschad,\r\nestimated the elevation of the Southern Sahara at 1637 feet, and German\r\ngeographers even ventured to add an additional thousand feet, Fournel,\r\nthe engineer, has, by careful barometric measurements, based on\r\ncorresponding observations, made it tolerably probable that a part of\r\nthe northern desert is below the sea’s level. The portion of the desert\r\nwhich is now called “Le Zahara d’Algérie,” advances to the chains of\r\nhills of Metlili and el-Gaous, where lies the most northern of all the\r\nOases, el-Kantara, fruitful in dates. This low basin, which reaches the\r\nparallel of 34° lat., receives the radiant heat of a stratum of chalk,\r\ninclined at an angle of 65° towards the south, and which is full of the\r\nshells of Inoceramus[DL]. “Arrived at Biscara (Biskra),” says Fournel,\r\n“an indefinite horizon, like that of the sea, lay spread before us.”\r\nBetween Biscara and Sidi Ocba the land is only 243 feet above the sea’s\r\nlevel. The inclination increases considerably towards the south. In\r\nanother work[DM], where I have brought together all the points that\r\nrefer to the depression of some portions of continents below the level\r\nof the sea, I have already noticed that, according to Le Père, the\r\nbitter lakes (_lacs amers_) on the isthmus of Suez, when they have but\r\nlittle water, and, according to General Andréossy, the Natron lakes of\r\nFayoum, are also lower than the level of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nAmong other manuscript notices of M. Fournel, I possess a geognostic\r\nvertical profile, with all the inflexions and inclinations of the\r\nstrata, representing the surface the whole way from the coast near\r\nPhilippeville to a spot near the Oasis of Biscara in the Desert of\r\nSahara. The direction of the line on which the barometric measurements\r\nwere taken is south 20° west; but the points of elevation determined are\r\nprojected, as in my Mexican profiles, on a different plane, one from N.\r\nto S. Ascending uninterruptedly from Constantine, whose elevation is\r\n2123 feet, the highest point is found between Batnah and Tizur, at only\r\n3581 feet. In the part of the desert which lies between Biscara and\r\nTuggurt, Fournel has succeeded in digging a series of artesian\r\nwells[DN]. We learn from the old accounts of Shaw, that the inhabitants\r\nof the country were acquainted with a subterranean supply of water, and\r\nrelated fabulous tales of a “sea under the earth (bahr tôhl el-erd).”\r\nFresh waters, which flow between clay and marl strata of the old chalk\r\nand other sedimentary formations, under the action of hydrostatic\r\npressure, form gushing fountains when the strata are pierced[DO]. The\r\nphenomenon of fresh water being often found near beds of rock salt, need\r\nnot surprise the geognosist, acquainted with mining operations, since\r\nEurope offers many analogous phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe riches of the desert in rock-salt, and its employment for purposes\r\nof building, have been known since the time of Herodotus. The salt zone\r\nof the Sahara (zone salifère du désert) is the most southern of the\r\nthree zones which pass through Northern Africa from south-west to\r\nnorth-east, and is believed to be connected with the beds of rock-salt\r\nin Sicily and Palestine described by Friedrich Hoffman, and by\r\nRobinson[DP].\r\n\r\nThe trade in salt with Sudan, and the possibility of cultivating the\r\ndate-tree in the many Oasis-like depressions, caused probably by\r\nearth-slips in the beds of tertiary chalk or Keuper-gypsum, have equally\r\ncontributed to animate the desert, at various parts, by human\r\nintercourse. The high temperature of the air, which renders the day’s\r\nmarch so oppressive across the Sahara, makes the coolness of the night\r\n(of which Denham and Sir Alexander Burnes frequently complained in the\r\nAfrican and Asiatic deserts) so much the more remarkable. Melloni[DQ]\r\nascribes this coolness (which is probably produced by the radiation of\r\nheat from the ground), not to the great purity of the heavens\r\n(irraggiamento calorifico per la grande serenità di cielo nell’ immensa\r\ne deserta pianura dell’ Africa centrale), but to the extreme calm, and\r\nthe absence of all movement in the air throughout the whole night[DR].\r\n\r\nThe river Quad-Dra (Wadi Dra), which is almost dry the greater part of\r\nthe year, and which, according to Renou[DS], is one-sixth longer than\r\nthe Rhine, flows into the Sahara in 32° north latitude, from the\r\nsouthern declivity of the Atlas of Morocco. It runs at first from north\r\nto south, until in 29° north lat., and 5° 8′ west long., it deflects at\r\nright angles to the west, and traversing the great fresh-water lake of\r\nDebaid, flows into the sea at Cape Nun, in lat. 28° 46′, and long. 11°\r\n8′. This region, which was first rendered celebrated by the Portuguese\r\ndiscoveries of the fifteenth century, and whose geography has\r\nsubsequently been shrouded in the deepest obscurity, is now known on the\r\ncoast as the country of the Scheik of Beirouk (whose dominions are\r\nindependent of the Emperor of Morocco). It was explored, in the months\r\nof July and August, 1840, by the French Count, Captain de\r\nBouet-Villaumez, under the orders of his government. From manuscript and\r\nofficial reports it would appear that the mouth of the Quad-Dra is at\r\npresent so much blocked up by sand as to have an open channel of only\r\nabout 190 feet. The Saguiel-el-Hamra,—still very little known,—which\r\ncomes from the south, and is supposed to have a course of at least 600\r\nmiles, flows into the same mouth at a point somewhat farther eastward.\r\nThe length of these deep, but generally dry, river-beds is astonishing.\r\nThey are ancient furrows, similar to those which I observed in the\r\nPeruvian desert at the foot of the Cordilleras, between the latter and\r\nthe shores of the Pacific. In Bouet’s manuscript narrative[DT], the\r\nmountains which rise to the north of Cape Nun are estimated at the great\r\nheight of 9,186 feet.\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that Cape Nun was discovered in 1433 by the\r\nKnight Gilianez, despatched under the order of the celebrated Infante,\r\nHenry, Duke of Viseo, and founder of the Academy of Sagres, which was\r\npresided over by the pilot and cosmographer, Mestre Jacomè, of Majorca;\r\nbut the _Portulano Mediceo_,—the work of a Genoese navigator of the year\r\n1351,—already contains the name of “Cavo di Non.” The doubling of this\r\nCape was as much dreaded as has been since then the passage round Cape\r\nHorn; although it is only 23′ north of the parallel of Teneriffe, and\r\nmight be reached by a few days’ sail from Cadiz. The Portuguese adage,\r\n“Quem passa o Cabo de Num, ou tornarà ou não,” could not intimidate the\r\nInfante, whose heraldic French motto of “Talent de bien faire,” well\r\nexpressed his noble, enterprising, and vigorous character. The name of\r\nthis Cape, which has long been supposed to originate in a play of words\r\non the negative particle, does not appear to me to be of Portuguese\r\norigin. Ptolemy placed on the north-west coast of Africa a river\r\n_Nuius_, in the Latin version _Nunii ostia_. Edrisi refers to a town,\r\nNul, or Wadi Nun, somewhat further south, and about three days’ journey\r\nin the interior, named by Leo Africanus _Belad de Non_. Several European\r\nnavigators had penetrated far to the south of Cape Nun before the\r\nPortuguese squadron under Gilianez. The Catalan, Don Jayme Ferrer, in\r\n1346, as we learn from the _Atlas Catalan_, published at Paris by\r\nBuchon, had advanced as far as the Gold River (_Rio do Ouro_), in 23°\r\n56′ north lat.; while the Normans, at the close of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, reached Sierra Leone in 8° 30′ north latitude. The merit of\r\nhaving been the first to cross the equator in the Western Ocean\r\nincontrovertibly belongs, like so many other great achievements, to the\r\nPortuguese.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\np. 7.—“_As a grassy plain, resembling many of the Steppes of Central\r\nAsia._”\r\n\r\nThe Llanos of Caracas, of the Rio Apure and the Meta, which are the\r\nabode of numerous herds of cattle, are, in the strictest sense of the\r\nword, grassy plains. The two families of the Cyperaceæ and the Gramineæ,\r\nwhich are the principal representatives of the vegetation, yield\r\nnumerous forms of Paspalum (_Paspalum leptostachyum_, _P. lenticulare_),\r\nof Kyllingia (_Kyllingia monocephala (Rottb.)_, _K. odorata_), of\r\nPanicum (_Panicum granuliferum_, _P. micranthum_), of Antephora,\r\nAristida, Vilfa, and Anthisteria (_Anthisteria reflexa_, _A. foliosa_).\r\nIt is only here and there that any herbaceous dicotyledon, as the\r\nlow-growing species of Mimosa intermedia and M. dormiens, which are so\r\ngrateful to the wild horses and cattle, are found interspersed among the\r\nGramineæ. The natives very characteristically apply to this group the\r\nname of “Dormideras,” or sleepy plants, because the delicate and\r\nfeathery leaves close on being touched. For many square miles not a tree\r\nis to be seen; but where a few solitary trees are found, they are, in\r\nhumid districts, the Mauritia Palm, and, in arid spots, a Proteacea\r\ndescribed by Bonpland and myself, the Rhopala complicata (_Chaparro\r\nbobo_), which Willdenow regarded as an Embothrium; also the useful Palma\r\nde Covija or de Sombrero; and our Corypha inermis, an umbrella palm\r\nallied to Chamærops, and used by the natives for the covering of their\r\nhuts. How much more varied and rich is the aspect of the Asiatic plains!\r\nIn a great portion of the Kirghis and Kalmuck Steppes which I have\r\ntraversed (extending over a space of 40 degrees of longitude), from the\r\nDon, the Caspian Sea and the Orenburg-Ural river Jaik, to the Obi and\r\nthe Upper Irtysch, near the Lake Dsaisang, the extreme range of view is\r\nnever bounded by a horizon in which the vault of heaven appears to rest\r\non an unbroken sea-like plain, as is so frequently the case in the\r\nLlanos, Pampas, and Prairies of America. I have, indeed, never observed\r\nanything approaching to this phenomenon, excepting, perhaps, where I\r\nhave looked only towards one quarter of the heavens, for the Asiatic\r\nplains are frequently intersected by chains of hills, or clothed with\r\nconiferous woods. The Asiatic vegetation, too, in the most fruitful\r\npasture lands, is by no means limited to the family of the Cyperaceæ,\r\nbut is enriched by a great variety of herbaceous plants and shrubs. In\r\nthe season of spring, small snowy white and red flowering Rosaceæ and\r\nAmygdaleæ (_Spiræa_, _Cratægus_, _Prunus spinosa_, _Amygdalus nana_),\r\npresent a pleasing appearance. I have elsewhere spoken of the tall and\r\nluxuriant Synanthereæ (_Saussurea amara_, _S. salsa_, _Artemisiæ_, and\r\n_Centaureæ_), and of leguminous plants, (species of the Astragalus,\r\nCytisus and Caragana). Crown Imperials (_Fritillaria ruthenica_ and _F.\r\nmeleagroides_), Cypripediæ and tulips gladden the eye with their varied\r\nand bright hues.\r\n\r\nA contrast is presented to this charming vegetation of the Asiatic\r\nplains by the dreary Salt Steppes, especially by that portion of the\r\nBarabinski Steppe which lies at the base of the Altai Mountains, between\r\nBarnaul and the Serpent Mountain, and by the country to the east of the\r\nCaspian. Here the social Chenopodiæ, species of Salsola, Atriplex,\r\nSalicorniæ, and Halimocnemis crassifolia[DU], cover the clayey soil with\r\npatches of verdure. Among the five hundred phanerogamic species which\r\nClaus and Göbel collected on the Steppes, Synanthereæ, Chenopodiæ, and\r\nCruciferæ were more numerous than the grasses; the latter constituting\r\nonly ¹⁄₁₁th of the whole, and the two former ⅐th and ⅑th. In Germany,\r\nowing to the alternation of hills and plains, the Glumaceæ (comprising\r\nthe Gramineæ, Cyperaceæ, and Juncaceæ) constitute ⅐th, the Synanthereæ\r\n(Compositæ) ⅛th, and the Cruciferæ ¹⁄₁₈th of all the German Phanerogamic\r\nspecies. In the most northern part of the flat land of Siberia, the\r\nextreme limit of tree and shrub vegetation (_Coniferæ_ and _Amentaceæ_)\r\nis, according to Admiral Wrangell’s fine map, 67° 15′ north lat., in the\r\ndistricts contiguous to Behring’s Straits, while more to the west,\r\ntowards the banks of the Lena, it is 71°, which is the parallel of the\r\nNorth Cape of Lapland. The plains bordering on the Polar Sea are the\r\ndomain of Cryptogamic plants. They are called Tundra (Tuntur in\r\nFinnish), and are vast swampy districts, covered partly with a thick\r\nmantle of Sphagnum palustre and other Liverworts, and partly with a dry\r\nsnowy-white carpet of Cenomyce rangiferina (Reindeer-moss), Stereocaulon\r\npaschale, and other lichens. “These _Tundra_,” says Admiral Wrangell, in\r\nhis perilous expedition to the Islands of New Siberia, so rich in fossil\r\nwood, “accompanied me to the extremest Arctic coast. Their soil is\r\ncomposed of earth that has been frozen for thousands of years. In the\r\ndreary uniformity of the landscape, and surrounded by reindeer, the eye\r\nof the traveller rests with pleasure on the smallest patch of green turf\r\nthat shows itself on a moist spot.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\np. 7.—“_A diversity of causes diminishes the dryness and heat of the New\r\nContinent._”\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to compress the various causes of the humidity and\r\nlesser heat of America into one general category. It will of course be\r\nunderstood, that I can only have reference here to the _general_\r\nhygroscopic condition of the atmosphere, and the temperature of the\r\n_whole_ continent; for in considering individual regions, as for\r\ninstance, the island of Margarita, or the coasts of Cumana and Coro, it\r\nwill be found that these exhibit an equal degree of dryness and heat\r\nwith any portion of Africa.\r\n\r\nThe maximum of heat, at certain hours of a summer’s day, considered with\r\nreference to a long series of years, has been found to be almost the\r\nsame in all regions of the earth, whether on the Neva, the Senegal, the\r\nGanges, or the Orinoco, namely, between 93° and 104° Fahr., and on the\r\nwhole not higher; provided that the observation be made in the shade,\r\nfar from solid radiating bodies, and not in an atmosphere filled with\r\nheated dust or granules of sand, and not with spirit-thermometers, which\r\nabsorb light. The fine grains of sand (forming centres of radiant heat)\r\nwhich float in the air, were probably the cause of the fearful heat\r\n(122° to 133° Fahr. in the shade) in the Oasis of Mourzouk to which my\r\nunhappy friend Ritchie, who perished there, and Captain Lyon, were\r\nexposed for weeks. The most remarkable instance of a high temperature,\r\nin an air probably free from dust, is mentioned by an observer who well\r\nknew how to arrange and correct all his instruments with the greatest\r\naccuracy. Rüppel found the temperature 110°.6 Fahr. at Ambukol, in\r\nAbyssinia, with a cloudy sky, a strong south-west wind, and an\r\napproaching thunder-storm. The _mean_ annual temperature of the tropics,\r\nor the actual climate of the region of palms, is on the main land\r\nbetween 78°.2 and 85°.5 Fahr., without any sensible difference between\r\nthe observations made in Senegal, Pondichery, and Surinam[DV].\r\n\r\nThe great coolness, one might almost say _coldness_, which prevails\r\nduring a great portion of the year in the tropics, on the coast of Peru,\r\nand which causes the mercury to fall to 59° Fahr., is, as I hope to show\r\nin another place, not to be attributed to the effect of neighbouring\r\nmountains covered with snow, but rather to the mist (_garua_) which\r\nobscures the sun’s disk, and to a current of _cold sea-water_ commencing\r\nin the antarctic regions, and which coming from the south-west, strikes\r\nthe coast of Chili near Valdivia and Concepcion, and is thence propelled\r\nwith violence, in a northerly direction, to Cape Pariña. On the coast of\r\nLima, the temperature of the Pacific is 60°.2 Fahr., whilst it is 79°.2\r\nFahr. under the same parallel of latitude when outside the current. It\r\nis singular, that so remarkable a fact should have remained unnoticed,\r\nuntil my residence on the coast of the Pacific, in October, 1802.\r\n\r\nThe variations of temperature, of many parts of the earth, depend\r\nprincipally on the character of the bottom of the aërial ocean, or in\r\nother words, on the nature of the solid or fluid (continental or\r\noceanic) base on which the atmosphere rests. Seas, traversed in various\r\ndirections by currents of warm and cold water (oceanic rivers), exert a\r\ndifferent action from articulated or inarticulated continental masses or\r\nislands, which may be regarded as the shoals in the aërial ocean, and\r\nwhich, notwithstanding their small dimensions, exercise, even to great\r\ndistances, a remarkable degree of influence on the climate of the sea.\r\nIn continental masses, we must distinguish between barren sandy deserts,\r\nsavannahs, (grassy plains,) and forest districts. In Upper Egypt and in\r\nSouth America, Nouet and myself found, at noon, the temperature of the\r\nground, which was composed of granitic sand, 154° and 141° Fahr.\r\nNumerous careful observations instituted at Paris, have given, according\r\nto Arago, 122° and 126°.5 Fahr.[DW] The Savannahs, which, between the\r\nMissouri and the Mississippi, are called _Prairies_, and which appear in\r\nthe south at the Llanos of Venezuela and the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, are\r\ncovered with small monocotyledons, belonging to the family of the\r\nCyperaceæ, and with grasses, whose dry pointed stalks, and whose\r\ndelicate, lanceolate leaves radiate towards the unclouded sky, and\r\npossess an extraordinary power of emission. Wells and Daniell[DX] have\r\neven seen in our latitude, where the atmosphere has a much less\r\nconsiderable degree of transparency, the thermometer fall to 14°.5, or\r\n18° Fahr. on being placed on the grass. Melloni has most ably shown[DY]\r\nthat in a calm, which is a necessary condition of a powerful radiation,\r\nand of the formation of dew, the cooling of the stratum of grass is\r\npromoted by the falling to the ground of the cooler particles of air, as\r\nbeing the heavier.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the equator, under the cloudy sky of the Upper\r\nOrinoco, the Rio Negro and the Amazon, the plains are covered with dense\r\nprimeval forests; but to the north and south of this woody district,\r\nthere extend, from the zone of palms and of tall dicotyledonous trees in\r\nthe northern hemisphere, the Llanos of the Lower Orinoco, the Meta, and\r\nGuaviare; and in the south, the Pampas of the Rio de la Plata and of\r\nPatagonia. The area thus covered by grassy plains, or Savannahs, in\r\nSouth America, is at least nine times greater than that of France.\r\n\r\nThe forest region acts in a threefold manner, by the coolness induced by\r\nits shade, by evaporation, and by the cooling process of radiation.\r\nForests uniformly composed in our temperate zone of “social” plants,\r\nbelonging to the families of the Coniferæ or Amentaceæ (the oak, beech,\r\nand birch), and under the tropics composed of plants not living\r\nsocially, protect the ground from direct insolation, evaporate the\r\nfluids they have themselves produced, and cool the contiguous strata of\r\nair by the radiation of heat from their leafy appendicular organs. The\r\nleaves are by no means all parallel to one another, and present\r\ndifferent inclinations towards the horizon; and according to the laws\r\nestablished by Leslie and Fourier, the influence of this inclination on\r\nthe quantity of heat emitted by radiation is such, that the radiating\r\npower of a given measured surface _a_, having a given oblique direction,\r\nis equal to the radiating power of a leaf of the size of _a_ projected\r\non a horizontal plane. In the initial condition of radiation of all the\r\nleaves which form the summit of a tree, and which partially cover each\r\nother, those which are directly presented towards the unclouded sky,\r\nwill be first cooled.\r\n\r\nThis production of cold (or the exhaustion of heat by emission) will be\r\nthe more considerable in proportion to the thinness of the leaves. A\r\nsecond stratum of leaves has its upper surface turned to the under\r\nsurface of the former, and will give out more heat by radiation towards\r\nthat stratum than it can receive from it. The result of this unequal\r\nexchange will then be a diminution of temperature for the second stratum\r\nalso. A similar action will extend from stratum to stratum, till all the\r\nleaves of the tree, by their greater or less radiation, as modified by\r\ntheir difference of position, have passed into a condition of stable\r\nequilibrium, of which the law may be deduced by mathematical analysis.\r\nIn this manner, in the serene and long nights of the equinoctial zone,\r\nthe forest air, which is contained in the interstices between the strata\r\nof leaves, becomes cooled by the process of radiation; for a tree, a\r\nhorizontal section of whose summit would hardly measure 2000 square\r\nfeet, would, in consequence of the great number of its appendicular\r\norgans (the leaves), produce as great a diminution in the temperature of\r\nthe air as a space of bare land or turf many thousand times greater than\r\n2000 square feet.[DZ] I have thus sought to develope somewhat fully the\r\ncomplicated relations which the action of great forest regions exerts on\r\nthe atmosphere, because they have so often been touched upon in\r\nconnection with the important question of the climate of ancient Germany\r\nand Gaul.\r\n\r\nAs in the old continent, European civilization has had its principal\r\nseat on the western coast, it could not fail to be early remarked that\r\nunder equal degrees of latitude the opposite eastern littoral region of\r\nthe United States of North America was several degrees colder, in mean\r\nannual temperature, than Europe, which is, as it were, a western\r\npeninsula of Asia, and bears much the same relation to it as Brittany\r\ndoes to the rest of France. The fact, however, escaped notice that these\r\ndifferences decrease from the higher to the lower latitudes, and that\r\nthey are hardly perceptible below 30°. For the west coast of the New\r\nContinent exact observations of the temperature are still almost\r\nentirely wanting; but the mildness of the winter in New California shows\r\nthat in reference to their mean annual temperature, the west coasts of\r\nAmerica and Europe under the same parallels, scarcely present any\r\ndifferences. The annexed table gives the mean annual temperatures, which\r\ncorrespond to the same geographical latitudes, on the eastern coast of\r\nthe New Continent and the western coast of Europe:—\r\n\r\n ──────────┬────────────┬──────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────────\r\n           │            │          │                 │Difference between\r\n  Similar  │  Eastern   │ Western  │Mean Temperature │    the annual\r\n Degrees of│  Coast of  │ Coast of │ of the Year, of │  Temperature of\r\n Latitude. │  America.  │ Europe.  │   Winter, and   │ Eastern America\r\n           │            │          │     Summer.     │   and Western\r\n           │            │          │                 │     Europe.\r\n ──────────┼────────────┼──────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────────\r\n           │            │          │           - 0°.4│\r\n    57° 10′│Nain        │          │   25°.7    —————│\r\n           │            │          │            45°.7│\r\n           │            │          │                 │             20°.7\r\n           │            │          │            31°.5│\r\n    57° 41′│            │Gottenburg│   46°.4    —————│\r\n           │            │          │            62°.4│\r\n ══════════╪════════════╪══════════╪═════════════════╪══════════════════\r\n           │            │          │              23°│\r\n    47° 34′│St. John’s  │          │   38°.1    —————│\r\n           │            │          │              54°│\r\n           │            │          │                 │\r\n           │            │          │            31°.1│\r\n    47° 30′│            │Buda      │   50°.5    —————│             13°.6\r\n           │            │          │            69°.8│\r\n           │            │          │                 │\r\n           │            │          │            37°.8│\r\n    48° 50′│            │Paris     │   51°.7    —————│\r\n           │            │          │            64°.6│\r\n ══════════╪════════════╪══════════╪═════════════════╪══════════════════\r\n           │            │          │            24°.1│\r\n    44° 39′│Halifax     │          │   43°.5    —————│\r\n           │            │          │            63°.0│\r\n           │            │          │                 │\r\n           │            │          │                 │             13°.7\r\n           │            │          │            42°.8│\r\n    44° 50′│            │Bordeaux  │   57°.2    —————│\r\n           │            │          │            71°.1│\r\n           │            │          │            32°.2│\r\n    40° 43′│New York    │          │   52°.5    —————│\r\n           │            │          │            72°.9│\r\n           │            │          │                 │\r\n           │            │          │            32°.2│\r\n    39° 57′│Philadelphia│          │   52°.2    —————│\r\n           │            │          │            72°.7│\r\n           │            │          │                 │\r\n           │            │          │            36°.0│\r\n    38° 53′│Washington  │          │   54°.9    —————│              9°.3\r\n           │            │          │            71°.1│\r\n           │            │          │                 │\r\n           │            │          │            49°.5│\r\n    40° 51′│            │Naples    │   61°.0    —————│\r\n           │            │          │            74°.9│\r\n           │            │          │                 │\r\n           │            │          │            52°.2│\r\n    38° 52′│            │Lisbon    │   61°.5    —————│\r\n           │            │          │            71°.1│\r\n ══════════╪════════════╪══════════╪═════════════════╪══════════════════\r\n           │            │          │            59°.5│\r\n    29° 48′│St. Agustin │          │   72°.3    —————│\r\n           │            │          │            81°.5│\r\n           │            │          │                 │              0°.5\r\n           │            │          │            58°.5│\r\n     30° 2′│            │Cairo     │   71°.8    —————│\r\n           │            │          │            84°.6│\r\n ──────────┴────────────┴──────────┴─────────────────┴──────────────────\r\n\r\nIn the preceding table the number placed before the fraction represents\r\nthe mean annual temperature, the numerator of the fraction, the mean\r\nwinter temperature, and the denominator the mean summer temperature.\r\nBesides the more marked difference between the mean annual temperatures,\r\nthere is also a very striking contrast between the opposite coasts in\r\nrespect to the distribution of heat over the different seasons of the\r\nyear; and it is indeed this distribution which exerts the greatest\r\ninfluence on our bodily feelings and on the process of vegetation.\r\nDove[EA] makes the general remark, that the summer temperature of\r\nAmerica is lower under equal degrees of latitude than that of Europe.\r\nThe climate of St. Petersburgh (lat. 59° 56′), or to speak more\r\ncorrectly, the mean annual temperature of that city, is found on the\r\neastern coast of America, in lat. 47° 30′, or 12° 30′ more to the south;\r\nand in like manner we find the climate of Königsberg (lat. 54° 43′) at\r\nHalifax in lat. 44° 39′. Toulouse (lat. 43° 36′) corresponds in its\r\nthermic relations to Washington.\r\n\r\nIt is very hazardous to attempt to obtain any general results respecting\r\nthe distribution of heat in the United States of North America, since\r\nthere are three regions to be distinguished—1, the region of the\r\nAtlantic States, east of the Alleghanys; 2, the Western States, in the\r\nwide basin between the Alleghanys and the Rocky Mountains, watered by\r\nthe Mississippi, the Ohio, the Arkansas, and the Missouri; and 3, the\r\nelevated plains between the Rocky Mountains and the Coast Range of New\r\nCalifornia, through which the Oregon or Columbia river wends its course.\r\nSince the commendable establishment by John Calhoun of uninterrupted\r\nobservations of temperature, made on a uniform plan, at thirty-five\r\nmilitary stations, and reduced to diurnal, mensal, and annual means, we\r\nhave attained more correct climatic views than were generally held in\r\nthe time of Jefferson, Barton, and Volney. These meteorological stations\r\nextend from the point of Florida and Thompson’s Island (West Key), lat.\r\n24° 33′, to the Council Bluffs on the Missouri; and if we reckon Fort\r\nVancouver (lat. 45° 37′), among them, they include a space extending\r\nover forty degrees of longitude.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be affirmed that on the whole the second region has a higher\r\nmean annual temperature than the first, or Atlantic. The further advance\r\ntowards the north of certain plants on the western side of the\r\nAlleghanys, depends partly on the nature of those plants and partly on\r\nthe different distribution through the seasons of the year of the same\r\nannual amount of heat. The broad valley of the Mississippi enjoys, at\r\nits northern extremity, the warming influence of the Canadian lakes, and\r\nat the south, that of the Mexican Gulf-Stream. These five lakes (Lakes\r\nSuperior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario,) cover an area of 92,000\r\nsquare miles. The climate is so much milder and more uniform in the\r\nvicinity of the lakes, that at Niagara, for instance (in 43° 15′ north\r\nlat.), the mean annual winter temperature is only half a degree below\r\nthe freezing-point, whilst, at a distance from the lakes, in 44° 53′\r\nnorth lat. at Fort Snelling, near the confluence of the river St. Peter\r\nwith the Mississippi, the mean winter temperature is 15°.8 Fahr.[EB] At\r\nthis distance from the Canadian lakes, whose surface is from five to\r\nupwards of six hundred feet _above_ the sea’s level, whilst the bottom\r\nof Lakes Michigan and Huron is five hundred feet _below_ it, recent\r\nobservations have shown that the climate of the country possesses the\r\nactual continental character of hotter summers and colder winters. “It\r\nis proved,” says Forry, “by our thermometrical data, that the climate\r\nwest of the Alleghany chain is more _excessive_ than that on the\r\nAtlantic side.” At Fort Gibson, on the Arkansas river, which falls into\r\nthe Mississippi, in lat. 35° 47′, where the mean annual temperature\r\nhardly equals that of Gibraltar, the thermometer was observed, in\r\nAugust, 1834, to rise to 117° Fahr. when in the shade, and without any\r\nreflected heat from the ground.\r\n\r\nThe statements so frequently advanced, although unsupported by\r\nmeasurements, that since the first European settlements in New England,\r\nPennsylvania, and Virginia, the destruction of many forests on both\r\nsides of the Alleghanys, has rendered the climate more equable,—making\r\nthe winters milder and the summers cooler,—are now generally\r\ndiscredited. No series of thermometric observations worthy of confidence\r\nextend further back in the United States than seventy-eight years. We\r\nfind from the Philadelphia observations that from 1771 to 1824, the mean\r\nannual heat has hardly risen 2°.7 Fahr.;—an increase that may fairly be\r\nascribed to the extension of the town, its greater population, and to\r\nthe numerous steam-engines. This annual increase of temperature may also\r\nbe owing to accident, for in the same period I find that there was an\r\nincrease of the mean winter temperature of 2° Fahr.; but with this\r\nexception the seasons had all become somewhat warmer. Thirty-three\r\nyears’ observations at Salem in Massachusetts show scarcely any\r\ndifference, the mean of each one oscillating within 1° of Fahrenheit,\r\nabout the mean of the whole number; and the winters of Salem, instead of\r\nhaving been rendered more mild, as conjectured, from the eradication of\r\nthe forests, have become colder by 4° Fahr. during the last thirty-three\r\nyears.[EC]\r\n\r\nAs the east coast of the United States may be compared, in equal\r\nlatitudes, with the Siberian and Chinese eastern coasts of Europe, in\r\nrespect to mean annual temperature, so the western coasts of Europe and\r\nAmerica have also very justly been compared together. I will here only\r\nadduce a few instances from the western region of the Pacific, for two\r\nof which, viz., Sitka. (New Archangel,) in Russian America, and Fort\r\nGeorge. (having the same latitudes respectively as Gottenburg and\r\nGeneva,) we are indebted to Admiral Lütke’s voyage of circumnavigation.\r\nIluluk and Danzig are situated in about the same parallel of latitude,\r\nand although the mean temperature of Iluluk, owing to its insular\r\nclimate and the cold sea current contiguous to it, is lower than that of\r\nDanzig, the winters of the former are milder than those of the Baltic\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n                                                                   33°.3\r\n Sitka       Lat. 57° 3′  Long.       135° 16′ W.       44°.6      —————\r\n                                                                   55°.0\r\n\r\n                                                                   31°.6\r\n Gottenburg  Lat. 57° 41′ Long.        11° 59′ E.       46°.4      —————\r\n                                                                   62°.4\r\n\r\n                                                                   37°.8\r\n Fort George Lat. 46° 18′ Long.       123° 58′ W.       50°.2      —————\r\n                                                                   60.°0\r\n\r\n                                                                   33.°6\r\n Geneva      Lat. 46° 12′ Altitude      1298 feet       49°.8      —————\r\n                                                                   63°.5\r\n\r\n                                                                   25°.0\r\n Cherson     Lat. 46° 38′ Long.        32° 39′ E.       53°.1      —————\r\n                                                                   71°.0\r\n\r\nSnow is hardly ever seen on the banks of the Oregon or Columbia river,\r\nand ice on the river lasts only a few days. The lowest temperature which\r\nMr. Ball ever observed there (in 1838) was 18°.4 Fahr.[ED] A cursory\r\nglance at the summer and winter temperatures given above, suffices to\r\nshow that a true insular climate prevails on and near the western\r\ncoasts; whilst the winter cold is less considerable than in the western\r\npart of the old continent, the summers are much cooler. This contrast is\r\nmade most apparent when we compare the mouth of the Oregon with Forts\r\nSnelling and Howard, and the Council Bluffs in the interior of the\r\nMississippi and Missouri basin, (44°–46° north lat.,) where, to speak\r\nwith Buffon, we find an _excessive_ or true _continental_ climate,—a\r\nwinter cold, which on some days is –32° or even –37° Fahr., followed by\r\na mean summer’s heat, which rises to 69° and 71°.4 Fahr.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\np. 8.—“_As if America had emerged later from the chaotic covering of\r\nwaters._”\r\n\r\nThe acute natural inquirer Benjamin Smith Barton, expresses himself thus\r\naccurately:[EE]—“I cannot but deem it a puerile supposition, unsupported\r\nby the evidence of nature, that a great part of America has probably\r\nlater emerged from the bosom of the ocean than the other continents.” I\r\nhave already elsewhere treated of this subject in a memoir on the\r\nprimitive nations of America:[EF]—“The remark has been too frequently\r\nmade by authors of general and well-attested merit that America was in\r\nevery sense of the word a _new_ continent. The luxuriance of vegetation,\r\nthe vast mass of waters in the rivers, and the continued activity of\r\ngreat volcanoes, confirm the fact (say these writers,) that the still\r\nagitated and humid earth is in a condition approximating more closely to\r\nthe chaotic primordial state of our planet than the old continent. Such\r\nideas appeared to me, long before my travels in those regions, no less\r\nunphilosophical than at variance with generally acknowledged physical\r\nlaws. These imaginary representations of an earlier age and a want of\r\nrepose, and of the increase of dryness and inertia with the increased\r\nage of our globe, could only have been framed by those who seek to\r\ndiscover striking contrasts between the two hemispheres, and who do not\r\nendeavour to consider the construction of our terrestrial planet from\r\none grand and general point of view. Are we to regard the southern as\r\nmore recent than the northern part of Italy, simply because the former\r\nis almost constantly disturbed by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions?\r\nHow inconsiderable, moreover, are the phenomena presented by our\r\nvolcanoes and earthquakes, when compared with the convulsions of nature\r\nwhich the geognosist must conjecture to have occurred in the chaotic\r\ncondition of our globe, when mountain masses were upheaved, solidified,\r\nor cleft asunder? Different causes must also occasion a diversity of\r\neffects in the forces of nature in parts of the earth remote from one\r\nanother. The volcanoes in the new continent,” (of which I still count\r\nabout twenty-eight,) “may probably have continued longer active, because\r\nthe high mountain ridges on which they are erupted in rows upon long\r\nfissures are nearer to the sea, and because this vicinity appears to\r\nmodify the energy of the subterranean fire, in a manner which, with few\r\nexceptions, has not yet been explained. Besides, both earthquakes and\r\nfire-erupting mountains act periodically. At present” (this I wrote\r\nforty-two years ago,) “physical disquietude and political repose prevail\r\nin the new continent, whilst in the old continent the calm repose of\r\nnature is contrasted with the dissensions of different nations. The time\r\nmay however come, when this strange contrast between physical and moral\r\nforces may change its theatre of action from one quarter of the world to\r\nanother. Volcanoes enjoy centuries of repose between their\r\nmanifestations of activity; and the idea that in the older countries\r\nnature must be characterized by a certain repose and quietude, has no\r\nother foundation than in the mere caprice of the imagination. There\r\nexists no reason for assuming that one side of our planet is older or\r\nmore recent than the other. Islands, as the Azores and many flat islands\r\nof the Pacific, which have been upheaved by volcanoes, or been gradually\r\nformed by coral animals, are indeed more recent than many plutonic\r\nformations of the European central chain. Small tracts of land, as\r\nBohemia and Kashmeer, and many of the valleys in the moon, inclosed by a\r\nring of mountains, may continue for a long time under the form of a sea,\r\nowing to partial inundations, and after the flowing off of these inland\r\nwaters, the bottom, on which plants would gradually manifest themselves,\r\nmight indeed be figuratively regarded as of more recent origin. Islands\r\nhave been connected together into continental masses by upheaval, whilst\r\nother parts of the previously existing land have disappeared in\r\nconsequence of the subsidence of the oscillating ground; but general\r\nsubmersions can, from hydrostatic laws, only be imagined as embracing\r\nsimultaneously all parts of the earth. The sea cannot permanently\r\nsubmerge the vast lowlands of the Orinoco and the Amazon, without at the\r\nsame time destroying our Baltic lands. Moreover the succession and\r\nidentity of the floetz strata, and of the organic remains of plants and\r\nanimals belonging to the primitive world, inclosed in those strata, show\r\nthat several great depositions have occurred almost simultaneously over\r\nthe whole earth.”[EG]\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\np. 8.—“_The Southern Hemisphere is cooler and more humid than the\r\nNorthern._”\r\n\r\nChili, Buenos Ayres, the southern part of Brazil, and Peru, enjoy the\r\ncool summers and mild winters of a true _insular climate_, owing to the\r\nnarrowness and contraction of the continent towards the south. This\r\nadvantage of the Southern Hemisphere is manifested as far as 48° or 50°\r\nsouth lat., but beyond that point, and nearer the Antarctic Pole, South\r\nAmerica is an inhospitable waste. The different degrees of latitude at\r\nwhich the _southern_ extremities of Australia, including Van Diemen’s\r\nIsland, of Africa, and America, terminate, give to each of these\r\ncontinents its peculiar character. The Straits of Magellan lie between\r\nthe parallels of 53° and 54° south lat.; and notwithstanding this, the\r\nthermometer falls to 41° Fahr. in the months of December and January,\r\nwhen the sun is eighteen hours above the horizon. Snow falls almost\r\ndaily in the lowlands, and the maximum of atmospheric heat observed by\r\nChurruca in 1788, during the month of December, and consequently in the\r\nsummer of that region, did not exceed 52°.2 Fahr. The Cabo Pilar, whose\r\nturret-like rock is only 1394 feet in height, and which forms the\r\nsouthern extremity of the chain of the Andes, is situated in nearly the\r\nsame latitude as Berlin.[EH]\r\n\r\nWhilst in the Northern Hemisphere all continents fall, in their\r\nprolongation towards the Pole, within a mean limit, which corresponds\r\ntolerably accurately with 70°, the southern extremities of America. (in\r\nTierra del Fuego, which is so deeply indented by intersecting arms of\r\nthe sea,) of Australia, and of Africa, are respectively 34°, 46° 30′ and\r\n56° distant from the South Pole. The temperature of the unequal extents\r\nof ocean which separate these southern extremities from the icy Pole\r\ncontributes essentially towards the modification of the climate. The\r\nareas of the dry land of the two hemispheres separated by the equator\r\nare as 3 to 1. But this deficiency of continental masses in the Southern\r\nHemisphere is greater in the temperate than in the torrid zone, the\r\nratio being in the former at 13 to 1, and in the latter as 5 to 4. This\r\ngreat inequality in the distribution of dry land exerts a perceptible\r\ninfluence on the strength of the ascending atmospheric current, which\r\nturns towards the South Pole, and on the temperature of the Southern\r\nHemisphere generally. Some of the noblest forms of tropical vegetation,\r\nas for instance tree-ferns, advance south of the equator to the\r\nparallels of from 46° to 53°, whilst to the north of the equator they do\r\nnot occur beyond the tropic of Cancer.[EI] Tree-ferns thrive admirably\r\nwell at Hobart Town in Van Diemen’s Land (42° 53′ lat.), with a mean\r\nannual temperature of 52°.2 Fahr., and therefore on an isothermal line\r\nless by 3°.6 Fahr. than that of Toulon. Rome, which is almost one degree\r\nof latitude further from the equator than Hobart Town, has an annual\r\ntemperature of 59°.7 Fahr.; a winter temperature of 46°.6 Fahr., and a\r\nsummer temperature of 86° Fahr.; whilst in Hobart Town these three means\r\nare respectively 52°, 42°.1, and 63° Fahr. In Dusky Bay, New Zealand,\r\ntree-ferns thrive in 46° 8′ lat., and in the Auckland and Campbell\r\nIslands in 53° lat.[EJ]\r\n\r\nIn the Archipelago of Tierra del Fuego, having a mean winter temperature\r\nof 33° Fahr., and a mean summer temperature of only 50° Fahr., in the\r\nsame latitude as Dublin, Captain King found “vegetation thriving most\r\nluxuriantly in large woody-stemmed trees of Fuchsia and Veronica;”\r\nwhilst this vigorous vegetation, which, especially on the western coast\r\nof America (in 38° and 40° south lat.), has been so picturesquely\r\ndescribed by Charles Darwin, suddenly disappears south of Cape Horn, on\r\nthe rocks of the Southern Orkney and Shetland Islands, and of the\r\nSandwich Archipelago. These islands, but scantily covered with grass,\r\nmoss, and lichens, _Terres de Désolation_, as they have been called by\r\nFrench navigators, lie far to the north of the Antarctic Polar Circle;\r\nwhilst in the Northern Hemisphere, in 70° lat., on the extremest verge\r\nof Scandinavia, fir-trees reach a height of more than 60 feet.[EK] If we\r\ncompare Tierra del Fuego, and more particularly Port Famine, in the\r\nStraits of Magellan, 53° 38′ lat., with Berlin, which is situated one\r\ndegree nearer the equator, we shall find for Berlin, 47°.3\r\n^{38°.9}/_{62°.3}; and for Port Famine, 42°.6 ^{34°.7}/_{50°.0} Fahr. I\r\nsubjoin the few certain data of temperature which we at present possess\r\nof the temperate zones of the Southern Hemisphere, and which may be\r\ncompared with the temperatures of northern regions in which the\r\ndistribution of summer heat and winter cold is so unequal. I make use of\r\nthe convenient mode of notation already explained in which the number\r\nstanding before the fraction indicates the mean annual temperature, the\r\nnumerator the winter, and the denominator the summer temperature.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────┬───────────┬───────────────────────\r\n                                    │   South   │ Mean Annual, Winter,\r\n Places.                            │ Latitude. │      and Summer\r\n                                    │           │     Temperatures.\r\n ───────────────────────────────────┼───────────┼───────────┬───────────\r\n                                    │           │           │      54°.5\r\n Sydney and Paramatta (New Holland) │    33° 50′│      64°.6│      —————\r\n                                    │           │           │      77°.5\r\n                                    │           │           │\r\n                                    │           │           │      58°.5\r\n Cape Town (Africa).                │    33° 55′│      65°.7│      —————\r\n                                    │           │           │      73°.2\r\n                                    │           │           │\r\n                                    │           │           │      52°.5\r\n Buenos Ayres                       │    34° 17′│      62°.4│      —————\r\n                                    │           │           │      73°.0\r\n                                    │           │           │\r\n                                    │           │           │      57°.4\r\n Monte Video                        │    34° 54′│        67°│      —————\r\n                                    │           │           │      77°.5\r\n                                    │           │           │\r\n                                    │           │           │      42°.1\r\n Hobart Town (Van Diemen’s Land)    │    42° 45′│      52°.5│      —————\r\n                                    │           │           │      63°.0\r\n                                    │           │           │\r\n                                    │           │           │      34°.7\r\n Port Famine (Straits of Magellan)  │    53° 38′│      42°.6│      —————\r\n                                    │           │           │      50°.0\r\n ───────────────────────────────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\np. 9.—“_One connected sea of sand._”\r\n\r\nAs we may regard the social _Erica_ as furnishing one continuous\r\nvegetable covering spread over the earth’s surface, from the mouth of\r\nthe Scheldt to the Elbe, and from the extremity of Jutland to the Harz\r\nmountains, so may we likewise trace the sea of sand continuously through\r\nAfrica and Asia, from Cape Blanco to the further side of the Indus, over\r\nan extent of 5,600 miles. The sandy region mentioned by Herodotus, which\r\nthe Arabs call the Desert of Sahara, and which is interrupted by oases,\r\ntraverses the whole of Africa like a dried arm of the sea. The valley of\r\nthe Nile is the eastern boundary of the Lybian desert. Beyond the\r\nIsthmus of Suez and the porphyritic, syenitic, and greenstone rocks of\r\nSinai begins the Desert mountain plateau of Nedschd, which occupies the\r\nwhole interior of the Arabian Peninsula, and is bounded to the west and\r\nsouth by the fruitful and more highly favoured coast-lands of Hedschaz\r\nand Hadhramaut. The Euphrates forms the eastern boundary of the Arabian\r\nand Syrian desert. The whole of Persia, from the Caspian Sea to the\r\nIndian Ocean, is intersected by immense tracts of sand (_bejaban_),\r\namong which we may reckon the soda and potash Deserts of Kerman,\r\nSeistan, Beludschistan, and Mekran. The last of these barren wastes is\r\nseparated by the Indus from the Desert of Moultan.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\np. 9.—“_The western portion of Mount Atlas._”\r\n\r\nThe question of the position of the Atlas of the ancients has often been\r\nagitated in our own day. In making this inquiry, ancient Phœnician\r\ntraditions are confounded with the statements of the Greeks and Romans\r\nregarding Mount Atlas at a less remote period. The elder Professor\r\nIdeler, who combined a profound knowledge of languages with that of\r\nastronomy and mathematics, was the first to throw light on this obscure\r\nsubject; and I trust I may be pardoned if I insert the communications\r\nwith which I have been favoured by this enlightened observer.\r\n\r\n“The Phœnicians ventured at a very early period in the world’s history\r\nto penetrate beyond the Straits of Gibraltar. They founded Gades and\r\nTartessus on the Spanish, and Lixus, together with many other cities on\r\nthe Mauritanian coasts of the Atlantic Ocean. They sailed northward\r\nalong these shores to the Cassiterides, from whence they obtained tin,\r\nand to the Prussian coasts where they procured amber found there; whilst\r\nsouthward they penetrated as far as Madeira and the Cape de Verd\r\nIslands. Amongst other regions they visited the Archipelago of the\r\nCanary Isles, where their attention was arrested by the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe, whose great height appears to be even more considerable than\r\nit actually is from the circumstance of the mountain projecting directly\r\nfrom the sea. Through their colonies established in Greece, especially\r\nunder Cadmus in Bœotia, the Greeks were made acquainted with the\r\nexistence of this mountain which soared high above the region of clouds,\r\nand with the ‘Fortunate Islands’ on which this mountain was situated,\r\nand which were adorned with fruits of all kinds, and particularly with\r\nthe golden orange. By the transmission of this tradition through the\r\nsongs of the bards, Homer became acquainted with these remote regions,\r\nand he speaks of an Atlas to whom all the depths of ocean are known, and\r\nwho bears upon his shoulders the great columns which separate from one\r\nanother the heavens and the earth,[EL] and of the _Elysian Plains_,\r\ndescribed as a wondrously beautiful land in the west.”[EM] Hesiod\r\nexpresses himself in a similar manner regarding Atlas, whom he\r\nrepresents as the neighbour of the Hesperides.[EN] The Elysian Plains,\r\nwhich he places at the western limits of the earth, he terms the\r\n‘Islands of the Blessed.’[EO] Later poets have still further embellished\r\nthese myths of Atlas, the Hesperides, their golden apples, and the\r\nIslands of the Blessed, which are destined to be the abode of good men\r\nafter death, and have connected them with the expeditions of the Tyrian\r\nGod of Commerce, Melicertes, the Hercules of the Greeks.\r\n\r\n“The Greeks did not enter into rivalship with the Phœnicians and\r\nCarthaginians in the art of navigation until a comparatively late\r\nperiod. They indeed visited the shores of the Atlantic, but they never\r\nappear to have advanced very far. It is doubtful whether they had\r\npenetrated as far as the Canary Isles and the Peak of Teneriffe; but be\r\nthis as it may, they were aware that Mount Atlas, which their poets had\r\ndescribed as a very high mountain situated on the western limits of the\r\nearth, must be sought on the western coast of Africa. This too was the\r\nlocality assigned to it by their later geographers Strabo, Ptolemy, and\r\nothers. As however no mountain of any great elevation was to be met with\r\nin the north-west of Africa, much perplexity was entertained regarding\r\nthe actual position of Mount Atlas, which was sought sometimes on the\r\ncoast, sometimes in the interior of the country, and sometimes in the\r\nvicinity of the Mediterranean, or further southward. In the first\r\ncentury of the Christian era, when the armies of Rome had penetrated to\r\nthe interior of Mauritania and Numidia, it was usual to give the name of\r\nAtlas to the mountain chain which traverses Africa from west to east in\r\na parallel direction with the Mediterranean. Pliny and Solinus were\r\nboth, however, fully aware that the description of Atlas given by the\r\nGreek and Roman poets did not apply to this mountain range, and they\r\ntherefore deemed it expedient to transfer the site of Mount Atlas, which\r\nthey described in picturesque terms, in accordance with poetic legends,\r\nto the _terra incognita_ of Central Africa. The Atlas of Homer and\r\nHesiod can, therefore, be none other than the Peak of Teneriffe, while\r\nthe Atlas of Greek and Roman geographers must be sought in the north of\r\nAfrica.”\r\n\r\nI will only venture to add the following remarks to the learned\r\nexplanations of Professor Ideler. According to Pliny and Solinus, Atlas\r\nrises from the midst of a sandy plain (_e medio arenarum_), and its\r\ndeclivity affords pasture to elephants, which have undoubtedly never\r\nbeen known in Teneriffe. That which we now term Atlas is a long mountain\r\nridge. How could the Romans have recognised one isolated conical\r\nelevation in this mountain range of Herodotus? May the cause not be\r\nascribed to the optical illusion by which every mountain chain, when\r\nseen laterally from an oblique point of view, appears to be of a narrow\r\nand conical form? I have often, when at sea, mistaken long mountain\r\nranges for isolated mountains. According to Höst, Mount Atlas is covered\r\nwith perpetual snow near Morocco. Its elevation must therefore be\r\nupwards of 11,500 feet at that particular spot. It seems to me very\r\nremarkable that the barbarians, the ancient Mauritanians, if we are to\r\nbelieve the testimony of Pliny, called Mount Atlas _Dyris_. This\r\nmountain chain is still called by the Arabs _Daran_, a word that is\r\nalmost identical in its consonants with _Dyris_. Hornius,[EP] on the\r\nother hand, thinks that he recognises the term Dyris in the word\r\n_Ayadyrma_, the name applied by the Guanches to the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe.[EQ]\r\n\r\nAs our present geological knowledge of the mountainous parts of North\r\nAfrica, which, however, must be admitted to be very limited, does not\r\nmake us acquainted with any traces of volcanic eruptions within historic\r\ntimes, it seems the more remarkable that so many indications should be\r\nfound in the writings of the Ancients of a belief in the existence of\r\nsuch phenomena in the Western Atlas and the contiguous west coast of the\r\ncontinent. The streams of fire so often mentioned in Hanno’s Ship’s\r\nJournal might indeed have been tracks of burning grass, or beacon fires\r\nlighted by the wild inhabitants of the coasts as a signal to warn each\r\nother of threatening danger on the first appearance of hostile vessels.\r\nThe high summit of the “Chariot of the Gods,” of which Hanno speaks (the\r\nθεῶν ὄχημα), may also have had some faint reference to the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe; but farther on he describes a singular configuration of the\r\nland. He finds in the gulf, near the Western Horn, a large island, in\r\nwhich there is a salt lake, which again contains a smaller island. South\r\nof the Bay of the Gorilla Apes the same conformation is repeated. Does\r\nhe refer to coral structures, lagoon islands (Atolls), and to volcanic\r\ncrater lakes, in the middle of which a conical mountain has been\r\nupheaved? The Triton Lake was not in the neighbourhood of the lesser\r\nSyrtis, but on the western shores of the Atlantic.[ER] The lake\r\ndisappeared in an earthquake, which was attended with great\r\nfire-eruptions. Diodorus[ES] says expressly πυρὸς εκφυτήματα μεγάλα. But\r\nthe most wonderful configuration is ascribed to the hollow Atlas, in a\r\npassage hitherto but little noticed in one of the philosophical Dialexes\r\nof Maximus Tyrius, a Platonic philosopher who lived in Rome under\r\nCommodus. _His_ Atlas is situated “on the continent where the Western\r\nLybians inhabit a projecting peninsula.” The mountain has a deep\r\nsemi-circular abyss on the side nearest the sea; and its declivities are\r\nso steep that they cannot be descended. The abyss is filled with trees,\r\nand “one looks down upon their summits and the fruits they bear as if\r\none were looking into a well.”[ET] The description is so minute and\r\ngraphic that it no doubt sprung from the recollection of some actual\r\nview.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\np. 9.—“_The Mountains of the Moon, Djebel-al-Komr._”\r\n\r\nThe Mountains of the Moon described by Ptolemy,[EU] σελήνης ὄρος, form\r\non our older maps a vast uninterrupted mountain chain, traversing the\r\nwhole of Africa from east to west. The existence of these mountains\r\nseems certain; but their extent, their distance from the equator, and\r\ntheir mean direction, still remain problematical. I have indicated in\r\nanother work[EV] the manner in which a more intimate acquaintance with\r\nIndian idioms and the ancient Persian or Zend teaches us that a part of\r\nthe geographical nomenclature of Ptolemy constitutes an historical\r\nmemorial of the commercial relations that existed between the West and\r\nthe remotest regions of Southern Asia and Eastern Africa. The same\r\ndirection of ideas is apparent in relation to a subject that has very\r\nrecently become a matter of investigation. It is asked, whether the\r\ngreat geographer and astronomer of Pelusium merely meant in the\r\ndenomination of Mountains of the Moon (as in that of “Island of Barley,”\r\n(Jabadiu, Java) to give the Greek translation of the native name of\r\nthose mountains; whether, as is most probable, El-Istachri, Edrisi,\r\nIbn-al-Vardi, and other early Arabian geographers, simply transferred\r\nthe Ptolemaic nomenclature into their own language; or whether\r\nsimilarity in the sound of the word and the manner in which it was\r\nwritten misled them? In the notes to the translation of Abd-Allatif’s\r\ncelebrated description of Egypt, my great teacher, Silvestre de\r\nSacy,[EW] expressly says, “The name of the mountains regarded by Leo\r\nAfricanus as furnishing the sources of the Nile, has generally been\r\nrendered ‘Mountains of the Moon,’ and I have adhered to the same\r\npractice. I do not know whether the Arabs originally borrowed this\r\ndenomination from Ptolemy. It may indeed be inferred that at the present\r\nday they understand the word ‏قمر‎ in the sense of _moon_, pronouncing\r\nit _kamar_; I do not think however, that such was the practice of the\r\nolder Arabs, who pronounced it _komr_, as has been proved by Makrizi.\r\nAboulfeda positively rejects the opinion of those who would adopt the\r\npronunciation _kamar_, and derive the word from the name of the moon.\r\nAs, according to the author of _Kamous_, the word _komr_, considered as\r\nthe plural of ‏اقمر‎, signifies an object of a greenish or dirty white\r\ncolour, it would appear that some authors have supposed that this\r\nmountain derived its name from its colour.”\r\n\r\nThe learned Reinaud, in his recent excellent translation of Abulfeda (t.\r\nii., p. i., pp. 81, 82), regards it as probable that the Ptolemaic\r\ninterpretation of the name of Mountains of the Moon (ὄρη σεληναῖα) was\r\nthat originally adopted by the Arabs. He observes that in the Moschtarek\r\nof Yakut, and in Ibn-Said, the mountain is written al-Komr, and that\r\nYakut writes in a similar manner the name of the Island of Zendj\r\n(Zanguebar). The Abyssinian traveller Beke, in his learned and critical\r\ntreatise on the Nile and its tributaries,[EX] endeavours to prove that\r\nPtolemy, in his σελήνης ὄρος, merely followed the native name, for the\r\nknowledge of which he was indebted to the extensive commercial\r\nintercourse which then existed. He says, “Ptolemy knew that the Nile\r\nrises in the mountainous district of Moezi, and in the languages which\r\nare spoken over a great part of Southern Africa (as, for instance, in\r\nCongo, Monjou, and Mozambique), the word _moezi_ signifies the moon. A\r\nlarge tract of country situated in the south-west was called Mono-Muezi,\r\nor Mani-Moezi, _i.e._, the land of the King of Moezi (or Moon-land); for\r\nin the same family of languages in which _moezi_ or _muezi_ signifies\r\nthe moon, _mono_ or _mani_ signifies a king. Alvarez[EY] speaks of the\r\n‘regno di Manicongo,’ or territory of the king of Congo.” Beke’s\r\nopponent, Ayrton, seeks the sources of the White Nile (Bahr el-Abiad),\r\nnot as do Arnaud, Werne, and Beke, near the equator, or south of it (in\r\n31° 22′ E. long. from Greenwich), but far to the north-east, as does\r\nAntoine d’Abbadie, in the Godjeb and Gibbe of Eneara (Iniara), therefore\r\nin the high mountains of Habesch, in 7° 20′ north lat., and 35° 22′ east\r\nlong. from Greenwich. He is of opinion that the Arabs, from a similarity\r\nof sound, may have interpreted the native name Gamaro, which was applied\r\nto the Abyssinian mountains lying south-west of Gaka, and in which the\r\nGodjeb (or White Nile) takes its rise, to signify a mountain of the moon\r\n(Djebel al-Kamar); so that Ptolemy himself, who was familiar with the\r\nintercourse existing between Abyssinia and the Indian Ocean, may have\r\nadopted the Semitic interpretation, as given by the descendants of the\r\nearly Arab immigrants.[EZ]\r\n\r\nThe lively interest which has recently been felt in England for the\r\ndiscovery of the most southern sources of the Nile induced the\r\nAbyssinian traveller above referred to, (Charles Beke) at a recent\r\nmeeting of the “British Association for the advancement of Science,”\r\nheld at Swansea, more fully to develope his ideas respecting the\r\nconnection between the Mountains of the Moon and those of Habesch. “The\r\nAbyssinian elevated plain,” he says, “generally above 8000 feet high,\r\nextends towards the south to nearly 9° or 10° north latitude. The\r\neastern declivity of the highlands has, to the inhabitants of the coast,\r\nthe appearance of a mountain chain. The plateau, which diminishes\r\nconsiderably in height towards its southern extremity, passes into the\r\nMountains of the Moon, which run not east and west, but parallel to the\r\ncoast, or from N.N.E. to S.S.W., extending from 10° north to 5° south\r\nlatitude. The sources of the White Nile are situated in the Mono-Moezi\r\ncountry, probably in 2° 30′ south latitude, not far from where the river\r\nSabaki, on the eastern side of the Mountains of the Moon, falls into the\r\nIndian Ocean, near Melindeh, north of Mombaza. Last autumn (1847), the\r\ntwo Abyssinian missionaries Rebmann and Dr. Krapf were still on the\r\ncoast of Mombaza. They have established in the vicinity, among the\r\nWakamba tribe, a missionary station, called Rabbay Empie, which seems\r\nlikely to be very useful for geographical discoveries. Families of the\r\nWakamba tribe have advanced westward five or six hundred miles into the\r\ninterior of the country, as far as the upper course of the river\r\nLusidji, the great lake Nyassi or Zambeze (5° south lat.?), and the\r\nvicinal sources of the Nile. The expedition to these sources, which\r\nFriedrich Bialloblotzky, of Hanover, is preparing to undertake” (by the\r\nadvice of Beke), “is to start from Mombaza. The Nile coming from the\r\nwest referred to by the ancients is probably the Bahr-el-Ghazal, or\r\nKeilah, which falls into the Nile in 9° north lat., above the mouth of\r\nthe Godjeb or Sobat.”\r\n\r\nRussegger’s scientific expedition—undertaken in 1837 and 1838, in\r\nconsequence of Mehemet Ali’s eager desire to participate in the gold\r\nwashings of Fazokl on the Blue (Green) Nile, Bahr el-Azrek—has rendered\r\nthe existence of a Mountain of the Moon very doubtful. The Blue Nile,\r\nthe Astapus of Ptolemy, rising from Lake Coloe (now called Lake Tzana),\r\nwinds through the colossal Abyssinian range of mountains; while to the\r\nsouth-west there appears a far extended tract of low land. The three\r\nexploring expeditions which the Egyptian Government sent from Chartum to\r\nthe confluence of the Blue and the White Nile (the first under the\r\ncommand of Selim Bimbaschi, in November, 1839; the next, which was\r\nattended by the French engineers Arnaud, Sabatier, and Thibaut, in the\r\nautumn of 1840; and the third, in the month of August, 1841), first\r\nremoved some of the obscurity which had hitherto shrouded our knowledge\r\nof the high mountains, which between the parallels of 6°–4°, and\r\nprobably still further southward, extend first from west to east, and\r\nsubsequently from north-west to south-east, towards the left bank of the\r\nBahr-el-Abiad. The second of Mehemet Ali’s expeditions first saw the\r\nmountain chain, according to Werne’s account, in 11° 20′ north lat.,\r\nwhere Gebel Abul and Gebel Kutak rise to the height of 3623 feet. The\r\nhigh land continued to approach the river more to the south from 4° 45′\r\nnorth lat. to the parallel of the Island of Tchenker in 4° 4′, near the\r\npoint at which terminated the expedition commanded by Selim and Feizulla\r\nEffendi. The shallow river breaks its way through the rocks, and\r\nseparate mountains again rise in the land of Bari to the height of more\r\nthan 3200 feet. These are probably a part of the Mountains of the Moon,\r\nas they are given in our most recent maps, although they are not covered\r\nwith perpetual snow, as asserted by Ptolemy.[FA] The line of perpetual\r\nsnow would assuredly not be found in these parallels of latitude below\r\nan elevation of nearly 15,500 feet above the sea’s level. It is not\r\nimprobable that Ptolemy extended the knowledge he may have possessed of\r\nthe high mountains of Habesch, near Upper Egypt and the Red Sea, to the\r\ncountry of the sources of the White Nile. In Godjam, Kaffa, Miecha, and\r\nSami, the Abyssinian mountains rise from 10,000 to nearly 15,000 feet,\r\nas we learn from exact measurements; (not according to those of Bruce,\r\nwho gives to Chartum an elevation of 5041 feet, instead of the true\r\nheight, 1524 feet!) Rüppell, who ranks amongst the most accurate\r\nobservers of the present day, found Abba Jarat (in 13° 10′ north lat.)\r\nonly 70 feet below the elevation of Mont Blanc,[FB] The same observer\r\nstates that a plain, elevated 13,940 feet above the Red Sea, was barely\r\ncovered with a thin layer of freshly fallen snow.[FC] The celebrated\r\ninscription of Adulis, which, according to Niebuhr, is of somewhat later\r\ndate than the age of Juba and Augustus, speaks of “Abyssinian snow that\r\nreaches to the knee,” and affords, I believe, the most ancient record in\r\nantiquity of snow within the tropics,[FD] as the Paropanisus is 12° lat.\r\nnorth of that limit.\r\n\r\nZimmermann’s map of the district of the Upper Nile shows the dividing\r\nline where the basin of the great river terminates in the south-east,\r\nand which separates it from the domain of the rivers belonging to the\r\nIndian Ocean, viz.; from the Doara which empties itself north of\r\nMagadoxo; from the Teb on the amber coast of Ogda; from the Goschop\r\nwhose abundant waters are derived from the confluence of the Gibu and\r\nthe Zebi, and which must be distinguished from the Godjeb, rendered\r\ncelebrated since 1839 by Antoine d’Abbadie, Beke, and the Missionary\r\nKrapf. In a letter to Carl Ritter I hailed with the most lively joy the\r\nappearance of the combined results of the recent travels of Beke, Krapf,\r\nIsenberg, Russegger, Rüppel, Abbadie, and Werne, as ably and\r\ncomprehensively brought together in 1843 by Zimmermann. “If a prolonged\r\nspan of life,” I wrote to him, “bring with it many inconveniences to the\r\nindividual himself, and some to those about him, it yields a\r\ncompensation in the mental enjoyment, afforded by comparing the earlier\r\nstate of our knowledge with its more recent condition, and of seeing the\r\ngrowth and development of many branches of science that had long\r\ncontinued torpid, or whose actual fruits hypercriticism may even have\r\nattempted to set aside. This genial enjoyment has from time to time\r\nfallen to our lot in our geographical studies, and more especially in\r\nreference to those portions of which we could hitherto only speak with a\r\ncertain timid hesitation. The internal configuration and articulation of\r\na continent depends in its leading characters on several plastic\r\nrelations which are usually among the latest to be elucidated. A new and\r\nexcellent work of our friend, Carl Zimmermann, on the district of the\r\nUpper Nile and of the eastern portions of Central Africa, has made me\r\nmore vividly sensible of these considerations. This new map indicates,\r\nin the clearest manner, by means of a special mode of shading, all that\r\nstill remains unknown, and all that by the courage and perseverance of\r\ntravellers of all nations (among which our own countrymen happily play\r\nan important part), has already been disclosed to us. We may regard it\r\nas alike important and useful that the actual condition of our\r\nknowledge, should, at different periods, be graphically represented by\r\nmen well acquainted with the existing and often widely scattered\r\nmaterials of knowledge, and who not merely delineate and compile, but\r\nwho know how to compare, select, and, where it is practicable, test the\r\nroutes of travellers by astronomical determinations of place. Those who\r\nhave contributed as much to the general stock of knowledge as you have\r\ndone, have indeed an especial right to expect much, since their\r\ncombinations have greatly increased the number of connecting points; yet\r\nI scarcely think that when, in the year 1822, you executed your great\r\nwork on Africa, you could have anticipated so many additions as we have\r\nreceived.” It must be admitted that, in some cases, we have only\r\nacquired a knowledge of rivers, their direction, their branches, and\r\ntheir numerous synonymes according to various languages and dialects;\r\nbut the courses of rivers indicate the configuration of the surface of\r\nthe earth, and exert a threefold influence; they promote vegetation,\r\nfacilitate general intercourse, and are pregnant with the future destiny\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nThe northern course of the White Nile, and the south-eastern course of\r\nthe great Goschop, show that both rivers are separated by an elevation\r\nof the surface of the earth; although we are as yet but imperfectly\r\nacquainted with the manner in which such an elevation is connected with\r\nthe highlands of Habesch, or how it may be prolonged in a southerly\r\ndirection beyond the equator. Probably, and this is also the opinion of\r\nmy friend Carl Ritter, the Lupata Mountains, which, according to the\r\nexcellent Wilhelm Peters, extend to 26° south lat., are connected by\r\nmeans of the Mountains of the Moon with this northern swelling of the\r\nearth’s surface (the Abyssinian Highlands). _Lupata_, according to the\r\nlast-named African traveller, signifies, in the language of Tette,\r\n_closed_, when used as an adjective. This mountain-range which is only\r\nintersected by some few rivers would thus be the _closed_ or _barred_.\r\n“The Lupata chain of the Portuguese writers,” says Peters, “is situated\r\nabout 90 leagues from the mouth of the Zambeze, and has an elevation of\r\nlittle more than 2000 feet. This mural chain has a direction due north\r\nand south, although it frequently deflects to the east or the west. It\r\nis sometimes interrupted by plains. Along the coast of Zanzibar the\r\ntraders in the interior appear to be acquainted with this long, but not\r\nvery high range, which extends between 6° and 26° south lat. to the\r\nFactory of Lourenzo-Marques on the Rio de Espirito Santo (in the Delagoa\r\nBay of the English). The further the Lupata chain extends to the south,\r\nthe nearer it approaches the coast, until at Lourenzo-Marques it is only\r\n15 leagues distant from it.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\np. 10.—“_The consequence of the great rotatory movement of the waters._”\r\n\r\nThe waters of the northern part of the Atlantic between Europe, Northern\r\nAfrica, and the New Continent, are agitated by a continually recurring\r\ngyratory movement. Under the tropics the general current to which the\r\nterm _rotation-stream_ might appropriately be given in consideration of\r\nthe cause from which it arises, moves, as is well known, like the trade\r\nwind from east to west. It accelerates the navigation of vessels sailing\r\nfrom the Canary Isles to South America; while it is nearly impossible to\r\npursue a straight course against the current from Carthagena de Indias\r\nto Cumana. This bend to the west, attributed to the trade winds, is\r\naccelerated in the Caribbean Sea by a much stronger movement, which\r\noriginates in a very remote cause, discovered as early as 1560 by Sir\r\nHumphrey Gilbert,[FE] and confirmed in 1832 by Rennell. The Mozambique\r\ncurrent, flowing from north to south between Madagascar and the eastern\r\ncoast of Africa, sets on the Lagullas Bank, and bends to the north of it\r\nround the southern point of Africa. After advancing with much violence\r\nalong the western coast of Africa beyond the equator to the island of\r\nSt. Thomas, it gives a north-westerly direction to a portion of the\r\nwaters of the South Atlantic, causing them to strike Cape St. Augustin,\r\nand follow the shores of Guiana beyond the mouth of the Orinoco, the\r\nBoca del Drago, and the coast of Paria.[FF] The New Continent from the\r\nIsthmus of Panama to the northern part of Mexico forms a dam or barrier\r\nagainst the movements of the sea. Owing to this obstruction the current\r\nis necessarily deflected in a northerly direction at Veragua, and made\r\nto follow the sinuosities of the coast-line from Costa Rica, Mosquitos,\r\nCampeche, and Tabasco. The waters which enter the Mexican Gulf between\r\nCape Catoche of Yucatan, and Cape San Antonio de Cuba, force their way\r\nback into the open ocean north of the Straits of Bahama, after they have\r\nbeen agitated by a great rotatory movement between Vera Cruz, Tamiagna,\r\nthe mouth of the Rio Bravo del Norte, and the Mississippi. Here they\r\nform a warm, rapid current, known to mariners as the _Gulf Stream_,\r\nwhich deflects in a diagonal direction further and further from the\r\nshores of North America. Ships bound for this coast from Europe, and\r\nuncertain of their geographical longitude, are enabled by this oblique\r\ndirection of the current to regulate their course as soon as they reach\r\nthe Gulf Stream by observations of latitude only. The bearings of this\r\ncurrent were first accurately determined by Franklin, Williams, and\r\nPownall.\r\n\r\nFrom the parallel of 41° north lat. this stream of warm water follows an\r\neasterly direction, gradually diminishing in rapidity as it increases in\r\nbreadth. It almost touches the southern edge of the Great Newfoundland\r\nBank, where I found the greatest amount of difference between the\r\ntemperature of the waters of the Gulf Stream and those exposed to the\r\ncooling action of the banks. Before the warm current reaches the Western\r\nAzores it separates into two branches, one of which turns at certain\r\nseasons of the year towards Ireland and Norway, while the other flows in\r\nthe direction of the Canary Isles and the western coast of Northern\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nThe course of this Atlantic current, which I have described more fully\r\nin the first volume of my travels in the regions of the tropics, affords\r\nan explanation of the manner in which, notwithstanding the action of the\r\ntrade winds, stems of the South American and West Indian _dicotyledons_\r\nhave been found on the coasts of the Canary Islands. I made many\r\nobservations on the temperature of the Gulf Stream in the vicinity of\r\nthe Newfoundland Bank. This current bears the warmer water of lower\r\nlatitudes with great rapidity into more northern regions. The\r\ntemperature of the stream is therefore from about 4°½ to 7° Fahr. higher\r\nthan that of the contiguous and unmoved water which constitutes the\r\nshore as it were of the warm oceanic current.\r\n\r\nThe flying-fish of the equinoctial zone (_Exocetus volitans_), is borne\r\nby its predilection for the warmth of the water of the Gulf Stream far\r\nto the north of the temperate zone. Floating sea-weed (_Fucus natans_),\r\nchiefly taken up by the stream in the Mexican Gulf, makes it easy for\r\nthe navigator to recognize when he has entered the Gulf Stream, whilst\r\nthe position of the branches of the sea-weed indicate the direction of\r\nthe current. The mainmast of the English ship of war, the Tilbury, which\r\nwas destroyed by fire in the seven years’ war on the coasts of Saint\r\nDomingo, was carried by the Gulf Stream to the northern coasts of\r\nScotland: and casks filled with palm-oil, the remains of the cargo of an\r\nEnglish ship wrecked on a rock off Cape Lopez in Africa, were in like\r\nmanner carried to Scotland, after having twice traversed the Atlantic\r\nOcean, once from east to west between 2° and 12° north lat., following\r\nthe course of the equinoctial current, and once from west to east\r\nbetween 45° and 55° north lat. by help of the Gulf Stream. Rennell, in\r\nthe work already referred to, p. 347, relates the voyage of a bottle\r\ninclosing a written paper which had been thrown from the English ship\r\nNewcastle in 38° 52′ north lat., and 63° 58′ west long., on the 20th of\r\nJanuary, 1819, and which was first seen on the 2nd of June, 1820, at the\r\nRosses in the north-west of Ireland, near the Island of Arran. Shortly\r\nbefore my arrival at Teneriffe a stem of South American cedar-wood\r\n(_Cedrela odorata_), thickly covered with lichens, was cast ashore near\r\nthe harbour of Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the Gulf Stream in stranding on the Azorean Islands of\r\nFayal, Flores, and Corvo, bamboos, artificially cut pieces of wood,\r\ntrunks of an unknown species of pine from Mexico or the West Indies, and\r\ncorpses of men of a peculiar race, having very broad faces, have mainly\r\ncontributed to the discovery of America, as they confirmed Columbus in\r\nhis belief of the existence of Asiatic countries and islands situated in\r\nthe west. The great discoverer even heard from a settler on the Cap de\r\nla Verga in the Azores “that persons in sailing westward had met with\r\ncovered barks, which were managed by men of foreign appearance, and\r\nappeared to be constructed in such a manner that they could not sink,\r\n_almadias con casa movediza que nunca se hunden_.” There are well\r\nauthenticated proofs, however much the facts may have been called in\r\nquestion, that natives of America (probably Esquimaux from Greenland or\r\nLabrador), were carried by currents or streams from the north-west to\r\nour own continent. James Wallace[FG] relates that in the year 1682 a\r\nGreenlander in his canoe was seen on the southern extremity of the\r\nIsland of Eda by many persons, who could not, however, succeed in\r\nreaching him. In 1684 a Greenland fisherman appeared near the Island of\r\nWestram. In the church at Burra there was suspended an Esquimaux boat,\r\nwhich had been driven on shore by currents and storms. The inhabitants\r\nof the Orkneys call the Greenlanders who have appeared amongst them\r\n_Finnmen_.\r\n\r\nIn Cardinal Bembo’s _History of Venice_ I find it stated, that in the\r\nyear 1508 a small boat, manned by seven persons of a foreign aspect, was\r\ncaptured near the English coast by a French ship. The description given\r\nof them applies perfectly to the form of the Esquimaux (_homines erant\r\nseptem mediocri statura, colore subobscuro, lato et patente vultu,\r\ncicatriceque una violacea signato_). No one understood their language.\r\nTheir clothing was made of fish skins sewn together. On their heads they\r\nwore _coronam e culmo pictam, septem quasi auriculis intextam_. They ate\r\nraw flesh, and drank blood as we would wine. Six of these men perished\r\nduring the voyage, and the seventh, a youth, was presented to the King\r\nof France, who was then at Orleans.[FH]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of men called _Indians_ on the coasts of Germany under\r\nthe Othos and Frederic Barbarossa in the tenth and twelfth centuries,\r\nand as Cornelius Nepos (in his _Fragments_),[FI] Pomponius Mela,[FJ] and\r\nPliny[FK] relate, when Quintus Metellus Celer was Proconsul in Gaul, may\r\nbe explained by similar effects of oceanic currents and by the long\r\ncontinuance of north-westerly winds. A king of the Boii, or, as others\r\nsay, of the Suevi, gave these stranded dark-coloured men to Metellus\r\nCeler. Gomara[FL] regards these Indian subjects of the King of the Boii\r\nas natives of Labrador. He writes, _Si ya no fuesen de Tierra del\r\nLabrador, y los tuviesen los Romanos por Indianos engañados en el\r\ncolor_. It may be inferred that the appearance of Esquimaux on the\r\nnorthern shores of Europe was more frequent in earlier times, for we\r\nlearn from the investigations of Bask and Finn Magnusen, that this race\r\nhad spread in the eleventh and twelfth century in considerable numbers,\r\nunder the name of Skrälingers, from Labrador as far south as the Good\r\nVinland, _i.e._ the shore of Massachussets and Connecticut.[FM]\r\n\r\nAs the winter cold of the most northern part of Scandinavia is\r\nameliorated by the action of the Gulf Stream, which carries American\r\ntropical fruits (as cocoa-nuts, seeds of _Mimosa scandens_ and\r\n_Anacardium occidentale_) beyond 62° north lat.; so also Iceland enjoys\r\nfrom time to time the genial influence of the diffusion of the warm\r\nwaters of the Gulf Stream far to the northward. The sea coasts of\r\nIceland, like those of the Faroe Isles, receive a large number of trunks\r\nof trees, driven thither from America; and this drift-wood, which\r\nformerly came in greater abundance, was used for the purposes of\r\nbuilding, and cut into boards and laths. The fruits of tropical plants\r\ncollected on the Icelandic shores, especially between Raufarhaven and\r\nVapnafiord, show that the movement of the water is from a southerly\r\ndirection.[FN]\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\np. 10.—“_Lecideæ and other Lichens._”\r\n\r\nIn northern regions, the absence of plants is compensated for by the\r\ncovering of _Bœomyces roseus_, _Cenomyce rangiferinus_, _Lecidea\r\nmuscorum_, _Lecidea icmadophila_, and other cryptogamia which are spread\r\nover the earth, and which may be said to prepare the way for the growth\r\nof grasses and other herbaceous plants. In the tropical world, where\r\nmosses and lichens are only observed to abound in shady places, some few\r\noily plants supply the place of the lowly lichen.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\np. 11.—“_The Care of Animals yielding milk._—_Ruins of the Aztek\r\nfortress._”\r\n\r\nThe two oxen already named, _Bos americanus_ and _Bos moschatus_, are\r\npeculiar to the northern part of the American continent. But the\r\nnatives—\r\n\r\n     _Queis neque mos, neque cultus erat, nec jungere tauros_\r\n                                                 Virg. Æn. i. 316.\r\n\r\ndrank the fresh blood, and not the milk, of these animals. Some few\r\nexceptions have indeed been met with, but only among tribes who at the\r\nsame time cultivated maize. I have already observed that Gomara speaks\r\nof a people in the north-west of Mexico who possessed herds of tame\r\nbisons, and derived their clothing, food, and drink from these animals.\r\nThis drink was probably the blood,[FO] for, as I have frequently\r\nremarked, a dislike of milk, or at least the absence of its use, appears\r\nbefore the arrival of Europeans to have been common to all the natives\r\nof the New Continent, as well as to the inhabitants of China and Cochin\r\nChina, notwithstanding their great vicinity to true pastoral tribes. The\r\nherds of tame lamas which were found in the highlands of Quito, Peru,\r\nand Chili, belonged to a settled and agricultural population. Pedro de\r\nCieça de Leon[FP] seems to imply, although assuredly as a very rare\r\nexception to the general mode of life, that lamas were employed on the\r\nPeruvian mountain plain of Callao for drawing the plough.[FQ] Ploughing\r\nwas, however, generally conducted in Peru by men only.[FR] Barton has\r\nmade it appear probable that the American buffalo had from an early\r\nperiod been reared among some West Canada tribes on account of its flesh\r\nand hide.[FS] In Peru and Quito the lama is nowhere found in its\r\noriginal wild condition. According to the statements made to me by the\r\nnatives, the lamas on the western declivity of the Chimborazo became\r\nwild at the time when Lican, the ancient residence of the rulers of\r\nQuito, was laid in ashes. In Central Peru, in the Ceja de la Montaña,\r\ncattle have in like manner become completely wild; a small but daring\r\nrace that often attacks the Indians. The natives call them “Vacas del\r\nMonte” or “Vacas Cimarronas.”[FT] Cuvier’s assertion that the lama had\r\ndescended from the guanaco, still in a wild state, which had\r\nunfortunately been extensively propagated by the admirable observer,\r\nMeyen,[FU] has now been completely refuted by Tschudi.\r\n\r\nThe Lama, the Paco or Alpaca, and the Guanaco are three originally\r\ndistinct species of animals.[FV] The Guanaco (Huanacu in the Quichua\r\nlanguage) is the largest of the three, and the Alpaca, measured from the\r\nground to the crown of the head, the smallest. The Lama is next to the\r\nGuanaco in height. Herds of Lamas, when as numerous as I have seen them\r\non the elevated plateaux between Quito and Riobamba, are a great\r\nornament to the landscape. The Moromoro of Chili appears to be a mere\r\nvariety of the lama. The different species of camel-like sheep found\r\nstill wild at elevations of from 13,000 to upwards of 16,000 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, are the Vicuña, the Guanaco, and the Alpaca; of\r\nthese the two latter species are also found tame, although this is but\r\nrarely the case with the Guanaco. The alpaca does not bear a warm\r\nclimate as well as the lama. Since the introduction of the more useful\r\nhorse, mule, and ass (the latter of which exhibits great animation and\r\nbeauty in tropical regions), the lama and alpaca have been less\r\ngenerally reared and employed as beasts of burden in the mining\r\ndistricts. But their wool, which varies so much in fineness, is still an\r\nimportant branch of industry among the inhabitants of the mountains. In\r\nChili the wild and the tame guanaco are distinguished by special names,\r\nthe former being called “Luan” and the latter “Chilihueque.” The wide\r\ndissemination of the wild Guanacos from the Peruvian Cordilleras to\r\nTierra del Fuego, sometimes in herds of 500 heads of cattle, has been\r\nfacilitated by the circumstance that these animals can swim with great\r\nfacility from island to island, and are not therefore impeded in their\r\npassage across the Patagonian channels or fiords.[FW]\r\n\r\nSouth of the river Gyla, which together with the Rio Colorado pours\r\nitself into the Californian Gulf (Mar de Cortes), lie in the midst of\r\nthe dreary steppe the mysterious ruins of the Aztek Palace, called by\r\nthe Spaniards “las Casas Grandes.” When, about the year 1160, the Azteks\r\nfirst appeared in Anahuac, having migrated from the unknown land of\r\nAztlan, they remained for a time on the borders of the Gyla river. The\r\nFranciscan monks, Garces and Font, who saw the “Casas Grandes” in 1778,\r\nare the last travellers who have visited these remains. According to\r\ntheir statement, the ruins extended over an area exceeding sixteen\r\nsquare miles. The whole plain was covered with the broken fragments of\r\ningeniously painted earthenware vessels. The principal palace, if the\r\nword can be applied to a house formed of unburnt clay, is 447 feet in\r\nlength and 277 feet in breadth.[FX]\r\n\r\nThe Tayé of California, a delineation of which is given by the Padre\r\nVenegas, appears to differ but inconsiderably from the _Ovis musimon_ of\r\nthe Old Continent. The same animal has also been seen in the Stony\r\nMountains near the source of the River of Peace, and differs entirely\r\nfrom the small white and black spotted goat-like animal found on the\r\nMissouri and Arkansas. The synonyme of Antilope furcifer, A. tememazama.\r\n(Smith,) and Ovis montana is still very uncertain.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\np. 11.—“_The culture of farinaceous grasses._”\r\n\r\nThe original habitat of the farinaceous grasses, like that of the\r\ndomestic animals which have followed man since his earliest migrations,\r\nis shrouded in obscurity. Jacob Grimm has ingeniously derived the German\r\nname for corn, _Getraide_, from the old German “gitragidi,” “getregede.”\r\n“It is as it were the _tame_ fruit (_fruges_, _frumentum_) that has\r\nfallen into the hands of man, as we speak of tame animals in opposition\r\nto those that are wild.”[FY]\r\n\r\n“It is a most striking fact that on one half of our planet there should\r\nbe nations who are wholly unacquainted with the use of milk and of the\r\nmeal yielded by narrow-eared grasses, (_Hordeaceæ_ and _Avenacecæ_)\r\nwhilst in the other hemisphere nations may be found in almost every\r\nregion who cultivate cereals and rear milch cattle. The culture of\r\ndifferent cereals is common to both hemispheres; but while in the New\r\nContinent we meet with only one species, maize, which is cultivated from\r\n52° north to 46° south lat., we find that in the Old World the fruits of\r\nCeres, (wheat, barley, spelt, and oats,) have been everywhere cultivated\r\nfrom the earliest ages recorded in history. The belief that wheat grew\r\n_wild_ in the Leontine plains as well as in other parts of Sicily was\r\ncommon to several ancient nations, and is mentioned as early as Diodorus\r\nSiculus.”[FZ] Cereals were also found in the alpine meadow of Enna.\r\nDiodorus says expressly, “The inhabitants of the Atlantis were\r\n_unacquainted with the fruits of Ceres_, owing to their having separated\r\nfrom the rest of mankind before those fruits were made known to\r\nmortals.” Sprengel has collected several interesting facts from which he\r\nis led to conjecture that the greater number of our European cereals\r\noriginally grew wild in Northern Persia and India. He supposes for\r\ninstance that summer wheat was indigenous in the land of the Musicani, a\r\nprovince of Northern India;[GA] barley, _antiquissimum frumentum_, as\r\nPliny terms it, and which was also the only cereal known to the\r\nGuansches of the Canaries, originated, according to Moses of\r\nChorene,[GB] on the banks of the Araxes or Kur in Georgia, and according\r\nto Marco Polo in Balascham, in Northern India;[GC] and _Spelt_\r\noriginated in Hamadan.\r\n\r\nMy intelligent friend and teacher, Link, has however shown in a\r\ncomprehensive and critical treatise,[GD] that these passages are open to\r\nmuch doubt. In a former essay of my own,[GE] I expressed doubts\r\nregarding the existence of wild cereals in Asia, and considered them to\r\nhave become wild. Reinhold Forster, who before his voyage with Captain\r\nCook made an expedition for purposes of natural history into the south\r\nof Russia by order of the Empress Catherine, reported that the two-lined\r\nsummer barley (_Hordeum distichon_) grew wild near the confluence of the\r\nSamara and the Volga. At the end of September in the year 1829,\r\nEhrenberg and myself also herborised on the Samara, during our journey\r\nfrom Orenburg and Uralsk to Saratow and the Caspian Sea. The quantity of\r\nwheat and rye plants growing wild on uncultivated ground in this\r\ndistrict was certainly very remarkable; but the plants did not appear to\r\nus to differ from the ordinary kinds. Ehrenberg received from M. Carelin\r\na species of rye, _Secale fragile_, that had been gathered on the\r\nKirghis Steppe, and which Marshal Bieberstein for some time conjectured\r\nto be the mother plant of our cultivated rye, _Secale cereale_.\r\nMichaux’s herbarium does not show (according to Achill Richard’s\r\ntestimony), that Spelt (_Triticum spelta_) grows wild at Hamadan in\r\nPersia, as Olivier and Michaux have been supposed to maintain. More\r\nconfidence is due to the recent accounts obtained through the unwearied\r\nzeal of the intelligent traveller, Professor Carl Koch. He found a large\r\nquantity of rye (_Secale cereale var._ β, _pectinata_) in the Pontic\r\nMountains, at heights of more than 5000 or 6000 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea, on spots where this species of grain had not within the memory\r\nof the inhabitants been previously cultivated. “Its appearance here is\r\nthe more important,” he remarks, “because with us this grain never\r\npropagates itself spontaneously.” Koch collected in the Schirwan part of\r\nthe Caucasus a kind of grain which he calls _Hordeum spontaneum_, and\r\nregards as the originally wild _Hordeum zeocriton_. (Linn.)[GF]\r\n\r\nA negro slave of the great Cortes was the first who cultivated wheat in\r\nNew Spain, from three seeds which he found amongst some rice brought\r\nfrom Spain for the use of the troops. In the Franciscan convent at Quito\r\nI saw, preserved as a relic, the earthen vessel which had contained the\r\nfirst wheat sowed in Quito by the Franciscan monk, Fray Jodoco Rixi de\r\nGante, a native of Ghent in Flanders. The first crop was raised in front\r\nof the convent, on the “Plazuela de S. Francisco,” after the wood which\r\nthen extended from the foot of the Volcano of Pichincha had been\r\ncleared. The monks, whom I frequently visited during my stay at Quito,\r\nbegged me to explain the inscription on the cup, which according to\r\ntheir conjecture contained some hidden allusion to wheat. On examining\r\nthe vessel, I read in old German the words “Let him who drinks from me,\r\nne’er forget his God.” This old German drinking cup excited in me\r\nfeelings of veneration! Would that everywhere in the New Continent the\r\nnames of those were preserved who, instead of devastating the soil by\r\nbloody conquests, confided to it the first fruits of Ceres! There are\r\n“fewer examples of a general affinity of names in terms relating to the\r\ndifferent species of corn and objects of agriculture than to the rearing\r\nof cattle. Herdsmen when they migrated to other regions had still much\r\nin common, while the subsequent cultivators of the soil had to invent\r\nspecial words. But the fact that in comparison with the Sanscrit, Romans\r\nand Greeks seem to stand on the same footing with Germans and\r\nSlavonians, speaks in favour of the very early contemporaneous\r\nemigration of the two latter. Yet the Indian _java_ (_frumentum\r\nhordeum_), when compared with the Lithuanian _jawai_, and the Finnish\r\n_jywa_, affords a striking exception.”[GG]\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\np. 11.—“_Preferring to keep within a cooler climate._”\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of Mexico and Peru we find the trace of human\r\ncivilisation confined to the elevated table-lands. We saw the ruins of\r\npalaces and baths on the sides of the Andes, at an elevation of from\r\n10,230 to 11,510 feet. None but northern tribes migrating from the north\r\ntowards the equator could have remained from preference in such a\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\np. 12.—“_The history of the peopling of Japan._”\r\n\r\nI believe I have succeeded in showing, in my work on the monuments of\r\nthe American primitive races,[GH] by an examination of the Mexican and\r\nThibetian-Japanese calendars, by a correct determination of the position\r\nof the Scansile Pyramids, and by the ancient myths which record four\r\nrevolutions of the world and the dispersion of mankind after a great\r\ndeluge, that the western nations of the New Continent maintained\r\nrelations of intercourse with those of Eastern Asia, long before the\r\narrival of the Spaniards. These observations have derived additional\r\nweight, since the appearance of my work, from the facts recently\r\npublished in England, France, and the United States, regarding the\r\nremarkable pieces of sculpture carved in the Indian style, which have\r\nbeen discovered in the ruins of Guatimala and Yucatan.[GI] The ancient\r\narchitectural remains found in the peninsula of Yucatan testify more\r\nthan those of Palenque, to an astonishing degree of civilization. They\r\nare situated between Valladolid, Merida, and Campeche, chiefly in the\r\nwestern portion of the country. But the monuments on the island of\r\nCozumel, (properly Cuzamil,) east of Yucatan, were the first which were\r\nseen by the Spaniards in the expedition of Juan de Grijalva in 1518, and\r\nin that of Cortes in 1519. Their discovery tended to diffuse throughout\r\nEurope an exalted idea of the advanced condition of ancient Mexican\r\ncivilization. The most important ruins of the peninsula of Yucatan\r\n(unfortunately not yet thoroughly measured and drawn by architects) are\r\nthose of the “Casa del Gobernador” of Uxmal, the Teocallis and vaulted\r\nconstructions at Kabah, the ruins of Labnan with its domed pillars,\r\nthose of Zayi which exhibit columns of an order of architecture nearly\r\napproaching the Doric, and those of Chiche with large ornamented\r\npilasters. An old manuscript written in the Maya language by a Christian\r\nIndian, which is still in the hands of the “Gefe politico” of Peto, Don\r\nJuan Rio Perez, gives the different epochs (_Katunes_ of 52 years) at\r\nwhich the Toltecs settled in different parts of the peninsula. Perez\r\nwould infer from these data that the architectural remains of Chiche go\r\nback as far as the fourth century of our era, whilst those of Uxmal\r\nbelong to the middle of the tenth century; but the accuracy of these\r\nhistorical deductions is open to great doubt.[GJ]\r\n\r\nI regard the existence of a former intercourse between the people of\r\nWestern America and these of Eastern Asia as more than probable,\r\nalthough it is impossible at the present time to say by what route and\r\nwith which of the tribes of Asia this intercourse was established. A\r\nsmall number of individuals of the cultivated hierarchical castes may\r\nperhaps have sufficed to effect great changes in the social condition of\r\nWestern America. The fabulous accounts formerly current regarding\r\nChinese expeditions to the New Continent refer merely to expeditions to\r\nFusang or Japan. It is, however, possible that Japanese and Sian-Pi may\r\nhave been driven by storms from the Corea to the American coasts. We\r\nknow as matters of history that Bonzes and other adventurers navigated\r\nthe Eastern Chinese seas in search of a remedial agent capable of making\r\nman immortal. Thus under Tschin-chi-huang-ti three hundred young couples\r\nwere dispatched to Japan in the year 209 before our era, who, instead of\r\nreturning to China, settled on the Island of Nipon.[GK] May not accident\r\nhave led to similar expeditions to the Fox Islands, to Alaschka, or New\r\nCalifornia? As the western coasts of the American continent incline from\r\nnorth-west to south-east, and the eastern coasts of Asia from north-east\r\nto south-west, the distance between the two continents in the milder\r\nzone, which is most conducive to mental development (45° lat.), would\r\nappear too considerable to admit of an accidental settlement having been\r\nmade in this latitude. We must therefore assume that the first landing\r\ntook place in the ungenial climate of 55° and 65°, and that cultivation,\r\nlike the general advance of population in America, progressed by gradual\r\nstations from north to south.[GL] It was even believed in the beginning\r\nof the sixteenth century that the fragments of ships from Catayo, _i.e._\r\nfrom Japan or China, had been found on the coasts of the Northern\r\nDorado, called also Quivira and Cibora.[GM]\r\n\r\nWe know as yet too little of the languages of America entirely to\r\nrenounce the hope that, amid their many varieties, some idiom may be\r\ndiscovered, that has been spoken with certain modifications in the\r\ninterior of South America and Central Asia, or that might at least\r\nindicate an ancient affinity. Such a discovery would undoubtedly be one\r\nof the most brilliant to which the history of the human race can hope to\r\nattain! But analogies of language are only deserving of confidence where\r\nmere resemblances of sound in the roots are not alone the object of\r\nresearch, but attention is also directed to the organic structure, the\r\ngrammatical forms, and those elements of language which manifest\r\nthemselves as the product of the intellectual power of man.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\np. 12—“_Many other forms of animal life._”\r\n\r\nThe Steppes of Caracas abound in flocks of the so-called _Cervus\r\nmexicanus_. This stag when young is spotted, and resembles the roe. We\r\nhave frequently met with perfectly white varieties, which is a very\r\nstriking fact when the high temperature of this zone is taken into\r\nconsideration. The _Cervus mexicanus_ is not found on the declivities of\r\nthe Andes in the equatorial region, at an elevation exceeding from 4476\r\nto 5115 feet, but another white deer, which I could scarcely distinguish\r\nby any one specific characteristic from the European species, ascends to\r\nan elevation of nearly 13,000 feet. The _Cavia capybara_ is known in the\r\nprovince of Caracas by the name of _Chiguire_. This unfortunate animal\r\nis pursued in the water by the crocodile, and on land by the tiger or\r\njaguar. It runs so badly that we were often able to catch it with our\r\nhands. The extremities are smoked and eaten as hams, but have a most\r\nunpleasant taste, owing to the flavour and smell of musk by which they\r\nare impregnated; and on the Orinoco we gladly ate monkey-hams in\r\npreference. These beautifully striped animals—the _Viverra mapurito_,\r\n_Viverra zorilla_, and _Viverra vittata_—exhale a fetid odour.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\np. 12—“_The Guaranes and the fan-palm Mauritia._”\r\n\r\nThe small coast tribe of the Guaranes (called in British Guiana, the\r\nWarraws, or Guaranos, and by the Caribs U-ara-u) inhabit not only the\r\nswampy delta and the river net-work of the Orinoco (more particularly\r\nthe banks of the Manamo grande and the Caño Macareo), but also extend,\r\nwith very slight differences in their mode of living, along the\r\nsea-shore, between the mouths of the Essequibo and the Boca de Navios of\r\nthe Orinoco.[GN] According to the testimony of Schomburgk, the admirable\r\nobserver referred to in the note, there are still about 1700 Warraus or\r\nGuaranos living in the vicinity of Cumaca, and along the banks of the\r\nBarime river, which empties itself into the gulf of the Boca de Navios.\r\nThe social habits of the tribes settled in the delta of the Orinoco were\r\nknown to the great historian Cardinal Bembo, the cotemporary of\r\nChristopher Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci, and Alonzo de Hojeda. He\r\nsays[GO] _quibusdam in locis propter paludes incolæ domus in arboribus\r\nœdificant_. It is hardly probable that instead of the Guaranos at the\r\nmouth of the Orinoco, Bembo should here allude to the natives of the\r\ncountry near the mouth of the gulf of Maracaibo, where Alonzo de Hojeda,\r\nin August, 1499, (when accompanied by Vespucci and Juan de la Cosa)\r\nfound a population having their dwellings _fondata sopra l’acqua come\r\nVenezia_ (“built like Venice on the water”).[GP] Vespucci, in the\r\naccount of his travels, in which we meet with the first traces of the\r\netymology of the name of the province of _Venezuela_ (Little Venice) as\r\nused for the province of Caracas, speaks only of houses built on a\r\nfoundation of piles, and makes no mention of habitations in trees.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh bears a subsequent and incontrovertible evidence to\r\nthe same fact, for he says expressly in his description of Guiana, that\r\non his second voyage in 1595, when in the mouth of the Orinoco, “he saw\r\nthe fire of the Tivitites and Qua-rawetes” (so he calls the Guaranes),\r\n“high up in the trees.”[GQ] There is a drawing of the fire in the Latin\r\nedition of this work,[GR] and Raleigh was the first who brought to\r\nEngland the fruit of the Mauritia palm, which he very justly compared,\r\non account of its scales, to fir-cones. Father José Gumilla, who twice\r\nvisited the Guaranes as a missionary, says, indeed, that this tribe have\r\ntheir dwelling in the Palmares (palm groves) of the morasses; but while\r\nhe speaks more definitely of pendent habitations supported by high\r\npillars, makes no mention of platforms attached to still growing\r\ntrees.[GS] Hillhouse and Sir Robert Schomburgk[GT] are of opinion that\r\nBembo, through the relations of others, and Raleigh, by his own\r\nobservation, were deceived into this belief in consequence of the high\r\ntops of the palm trees being lighted up in such a manner by the fires\r\nbelow them, that those sailing by thought the habitations of the\r\nGuaranes were attached to the trees themselves. “We do not deny,” says\r\nSchomburgk, “that in order to escape the attacks of the mosquitos, the\r\nIndian sometimes suspends his hammock from the tops of trees, but on\r\nsuch occasions no fires are made under the hammock.”[GU]\r\n\r\nAccording to Martius, the beautiful Palm, Moriche, _Mauritia flexuosa_,\r\n_Quieteva_, or _Ita_ Palm,[GV] belongs, together with Calamus, to the\r\nfamily of the Lepidocaryæ or Corypheæ. Linnæus has described it very\r\nimperfectly, as he erroneously considered it to be devoid of leaves. The\r\ntrunk is 26 feet high, but it probably does not attain this height in\r\nless than 120 or even 150 years. The Mauritia extends high up the\r\ndeclivity of the Duida, north of the Esmeralda mission, where I found it\r\nin great beauty. It forms, in moist places, fine groups of a fresh and\r\nshining verdure, reminding us of that of our alders. The trees preserve\r\nthe moisture of the ground by their shade, and hence the Indians believe\r\nthat the Mauritia draws water around its roots by some mysterious\r\nattraction. In conformity with an analogous theory they advise, that\r\nserpents should not be killed, because the destruction of these animals\r\nis followed by the drying up of the lagoons. Thus do the rude children\r\nof nature confound cause and effect! Gumilla calls the _Mauritia\r\nflexuosa_ of the Guaranes the tree of life (“arbol de la vida”). It is\r\nfound on the mountains of Ronaima, east of the sources of the Orinoco,\r\nas high as 4263 feet. On the unfrequented banks of the Rio Atabapo, in\r\nthe interior of Guiana, we discovered a new species of Mauritia having a\r\nprickly stem; our _Mauritia aculeata_.[GW]\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\np. 13.—“_An American Stylite._”\r\n\r\nThe founder of the sect of Stylites, the fanatical Pillar-saint, Simeon\r\nSisanites of Syria, the son of a Syrian herdsman, is said to have passed\r\nthirty-seven years in holy contemplation, elevated on five columns, each\r\nhigher than the preceding. He died in the year 461. The last of the\r\npillars which he occupied was 40 ells in height. For seven hundred years\r\nthere continued to be followers of this mode of life, who were called\r\n_Sancti Columnares_, or Pillar-saints. Even in Germany, in the see of\r\nTreves, attempts were made to found similar aërial cloisters; but the\r\ndangerous practice met with the constant opposition of the bishops.[GX]\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\np. 14.—“_Towns on the banks of the Steppe-rivers._”\r\n\r\nFamilies who live by raising cattle and do not take part in agricultural\r\npursuits have congregated together in the middle of the Steppe, in small\r\ntowns, which, in the cultivated parts of Europe, would scarcely be\r\nregarded as villages. Among these are Calabozo, which, according to my\r\nastronomical observations, is situated in 8° 56′ 14″ north lat., and 67°\r\n43′ west long.; Villa del Pao (8° 38′ 1″ north lat., and 66° 57′ west\r\nlong.); Saint Sebastian, and others.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\np. 14.—“_Funnel-shaped clouds._”\r\n\r\nThe singular phenomenon of these sand-spouts, of which we see something\r\nanalogous on the cross roads of Europe, is especially characteristic of\r\nthe Peruvian sandy desert between Amotape and Coquimbo. Such dense\r\nclouds of sand may endanger the safety of the traveller who does not\r\ncautiously avoid them. It is remarkable that these partial and opposing\r\ncurrents of air should arise only when there is a general calm. The\r\naërial ocean resembles the sea in this respect; for here, too, we find\r\nthat the small currents (_filets de courant_) in which the water may\r\nfrequently be heard to flow with a splashing sound, occur only in a dead\r\ncalm (_calme plat_).\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\np. 14.—“_Increases the stifling oppression._”\r\n\r\nI have observed in the Llanos de Apure, at the cattle farm of Guadalupe,\r\nthat the thermometer rose from 92°.7 to 97°.2 Fahr. whenever the hot\r\nwind began to blow from the desert, which was covered either with sand\r\nor short withered grass. In the middle of the sand-cloud the thermometer\r\nstood for several minutes together at 111° Fahr. The dry sand in the\r\nvillage of San Fernando de Apure had a temperature of 126° Fahr.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\np. 15.—“_The phantom of a moving undulating surface._”\r\n\r\nThe well known phenomenon of the _mirage_ is called in Sanscrit “the\r\nthirst of the gazelle.”[GY] All objects appear to float in the air,\r\nwhile their forms are reflected in the lower stratum of the atmosphere.\r\nAt such times the whole desert resembles a vast lake, whose surface\r\nundulates like waves. Palm trees, cattle, and camels sometimes appear\r\ninverted in the horizon. In the French expedition to Egypt, this optical\r\nillusion often nearly drove the faint and parched soldiers to\r\ndistraction. This phenomenon has been observed in all quarters of the\r\nworld. The ancients were also acquainted with the remarkable refraction\r\nof the rays of light in the Lybian Desert. We find mention made in\r\nDiodorus Siculus of strange illusive appearances, an African _Fata\r\nMorgana_, together with still more extravagant explanations of the\r\nconglomeration of the particles of air.[GZ]\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\np. 15.—“_The Melocactus._”\r\n\r\nThe _Cactus melocactus_ is frequently from 10 to 12 inches in diameter,\r\nand has generally 14 ribs. The natural group of the Cactaceæ, the whole\r\nfamily of the Nopaleæ of Jussieu, belongs exclusively to the New\r\nContinent. The Cactus assumes a variety of shapes, being ribbed and\r\nmelon-like (_Melocacti_); articulated (_Opuntiæ_); upright-like columns\r\n(_Cerei_); of a serpentine or creeping form (_Rhipsalides_); or provided\r\nwith leaves (_Pereskiæ_). Many extend high up the slopes of the\r\nmountains. Near the foot of the Chimborazo, in the sandy table-land\r\naround Riobamba, I found a new species of Pitahaya (_Cactus sepium_),\r\neven at an elevation of 10,660 feet.[HA]\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\np. 16.—“_The scene suddenly changes in the Steppe._”\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to describe the approach of the rainy season, and the\r\nsigns by which it is announced. The deep blue of the heavens in the\r\ntropics is occasioned by the imperfect solution of vapour. The\r\ncyanometer indicates a lighter shade of blue as soon as the vapours\r\nbegin to fall. The dark spot in the constellation of the Southern Cross\r\nbecomes indistinct in proportion as the transparency of the atmosphere\r\ndecreases, and this change announces the approach of rain. The bright\r\nradiance of the Magellanic clouds (_Nubecula major_ and _Nubecula\r\nminor_) then gradually fades away. The fixed stars which had before been\r\nshining with a calm, steady, planetlike light, are now seen to\r\nscintillate in the zenith.[HB] All these phenomena are the result of the\r\nincreased quantity of aqueous vapour floating in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\np. 16.—“_The humid clay soil is seen to rise slowly in a broad flake._”\r\n\r\nDrought produces the same phenomena in animals and plants as the\r\nabstraction of heat. During the dry season many tropical plants lose\r\ntheir leaves. The crocodile and other amphibious animals conceal\r\nthemselves in the mud and lie apparently dead, like animals in cold\r\nregions who are thrown into a state of hybernation.[HC]\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\np. 17.—“_A vast inland sea._”\r\n\r\nNowhere are these inundations on a larger scale than in the net-work of\r\nstreams formed by the Apure, the Arachuna, the Payara, the Arauca, and\r\nthe Cabuliare. Large vessels sail across the country over the Steppe for\r\n40 or 50 miles.\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\np. 17.—“_To the mountainous plain of Antisana._”\r\n\r\nThe great mountain plateau which surrounds the volcano of Antisana is\r\n13,473 feet above the level of the sea. The pressure of the atmosphere\r\nis so inconsiderable at this height, that blood will flow from the\r\nnostrils and mouth of the wild bull when hunted with dogs.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\np. 17.—“_The marshy waters of Bera and Rastro._”\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere more circumstantially described the capture of the\r\ngymnotus.[HD] Mons. Gay Lussac and myself were perfectly successful in\r\nthe experiments we conducted without a chain on a living gymnotus, which\r\nwas still very vigorous when it reached Paris. The discharge of\r\nelectricity is entirely dependent on the will of the animal. We did not\r\nobserve any electric sparks, but other physicists have done so on\r\nnumerous occasions.\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\np. 18.—“_Awakened by the contact of moist and dissimilar particles._”\r\n\r\nIn all organic bodies dissimilar substances come into contact with each\r\nother, and solids are associated with fluids. Wherever there is\r\norganization and life, there must be electric tension, or, in other\r\nwords, a voltaic pile must be brought into play, as the experiments of\r\nNobili and Matteucci, and more especially the late most admirable\r\nlabours of Emil Dubois, teach us. The last-named physicist has succeeded\r\nin “manifesting the presence of the electric muscular current in living\r\nand wholly uninjured animal bodies:” he shows that “the human body,\r\nthrough the medium of a copper wire, can at will cause the magnetic\r\nneedle at a distance to deflect first in one direction and then in\r\nanother.”[HE] I have myself witnessed these movements produced at will,\r\nand have thus unexpectedly seen much light thrown on phenomena, to which\r\nI had laboriously and ardently devoted so many years of my earlier life.\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\np. 19.—“_The myth of Osiris and Typhon._”\r\n\r\nRespecting the struggle of two human races, the Arabian shepherd tribes\r\nof Lower Egypt and the cultivated agricultural races of Upper Egypt; on\r\nthe subject of the fair-haired Prince _Baby_ or _Typhon_, who founded\r\nPelusium; and on the dark-complexioned Dionysos or Osiris; I would refer\r\nto Zoëga’s older and almost universally discarded views as set forth at\r\np. 577 of his masterly work “_De origine et usu obeliscorum_.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\np. 19—“_The boundaries of European semi-civilization._”\r\n\r\nIn the Capitania General de Caracas, as well as in all the eastern part\r\nof America, the civilization formerly introduced by Europeans is limited\r\nto the narrow strip of land which skirts the shore. In Mexico, New\r\nGranada, and Quito on the other hand, European civilization has\r\npenetrated far into the interior of the country and advanced up to the\r\nridges of the Cordilleras. There existed already in the fifteenth\r\ncentury an earlier stage of civilization among the inhabitants of the\r\nlast-named region. Wherever the Spaniards perceived this culture they\r\npursued its track, regardless whether the seat of it was at a distance\r\nfrom the sea, or in its vicinity. The ancient cities were enlarged and\r\ntheir former significant Indian names mutilated, or exchanged for those\r\nof Christian saints.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\np. 19—“_Huge masses of leaden-coloured granite._”\r\n\r\nIn the Orinoco, and more especially at the cataracts of Maypures and\r\nAtures (not in the Black River or Rio Negro), all blocks of granite,\r\neven pieces of white quartz, wherever they come in contact with the\r\nwater, acquire a grayish black coating, which does not penetrate beyond\r\n0·01 of a line into the interior of the rock. The traveller might almost\r\nsuppose that he was looking at basalt, or fossils coloured with\r\ngraphite. Indeed, the crust does actually appear to contain manganese\r\nand carbon. I say “appears” to do so, because the phenomenon has not yet\r\nbeen thoroughly investigated. Something perfectly analogous to this was\r\nobserved by Rozier in the syenitic rocks of the Nile (near Syene and\r\nPhilæ); by the unfortunate Captain Tuckey on the rocky banks of the\r\nZaire; and by Sir Robert Schomburgk at Berbice.[HF] On the Orinoco these\r\nleaden-coloured rocks are supposed when wet to give forth noxious\r\nexhalations, and their vicinity is believed to be conducive to the\r\ngeneration of fevers.[HG] It is also remarkable that the South American\r\nrivers generally, which have black waters (_aguas negras_), or waters of\r\na coffee brown or wine yellow tint, do not darken the granite rocks;\r\nthat is to say, they do not act upon the stone in such a manner as to\r\nform from its constituent parts a black or leaden-coloured crust.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\np. 20—“_The rain-foreboding howl of the bearded ape._”\r\n\r\nSome hours before the commencement of rain, the melancholy cries of\r\nvarious apes, as _Simia seniculus_, _Simia beelzebub_, &c., fall on the\r\near like a storm raging in the distance. The intensity of the noise\r\nproduced by such small animals can only be explained by the circumstance\r\nthat one tree often contains a herd of seventy or eighty apes. I have\r\nelsewhere spoken of the laryngeal sac, and the ossification of the\r\nlarynx of these animals.[HH]\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\np. 20—“_Its uncouth body often covered with birds._”\r\n\r\nThe crocodiles lie so motionless, that I have often seen flamingoes\r\n(_Phœnicopterus_) resting on their heads, while the other parts of the\r\nbody were covered, like the trunk of a tree, with aquatic birds.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\np. 20—“_Down its dilating throat._”\r\n\r\nThe saliva with which the boa covers its prey tends to promote rapid\r\ndecomposition. The muscular flesh is rendered gelatinously soft under\r\nits action, so that the animal is able to force entire limbs of its\r\nslain victim through its swelling throat. The Creoles call the giant boa\r\n_Tragavenado_ (_stag-swallower_), and fabulously relate that the antlers\r\nof a stag which could not be swallowed by the snake have been seen fixed\r\nin its throat. I have frequently observed the boa constrictor swimming\r\nin the Orinoco, and in the smaller forest streams, the Tuamini, the\r\nTemi, and the Atabapo. It holds its head above water like a dog. Its\r\nskin is beautifully speckled. It has been asserted, that the animal\r\nattains a length of 48 feet, but the longest skins which have as yet\r\nbeen carefully measured in Europe do not exceed from 21 to 23 feet. The\r\nSouth American boa (a Python) differs from the East Indian.[HI]\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\np. 20—“_Living on gums and earth._”\r\n\r\nIt is currently reported throughout the coasts of Cumana, New Barcelona,\r\nand Caracas (which the Franciscan monks of Guiana are in the habit of\r\nvisiting on their return from the missions,) that there are men living\r\non the banks of the Orinoco who eat earth. On the 6th of June, 1800, on\r\nour return from the Rio Negro, when we descended the Orinoco in\r\nthirty-six days, we spent the day at the mission inhabited by these\r\npeople (the Otomacs). Their little village, which is called La\r\nConcepcion de Uruana, is very picturesquely built against a granite\r\nrock. It is situated in 7° 8′ 3″ north lat.; and according to my\r\nchronometrical determination, in 67° 18′ west longitude. The earth which\r\nthe Otomacs eat, is an unctuous, almost tasteless clay, true potter’s\r\nearth, of a yellowish grey colour, in consequence of a slight admixture\r\nof oxide of iron. They select it with great care, and seek it in certain\r\nbanks on the shores of the Orinoco and Meta. They distinguish the\r\nflavour of one kind of earth from that of another; all kinds of clay not\r\nbeing alike acceptable to their palate. They knead this earth into balls\r\nmeasuring from four to six inches in diameter, and bake them before a\r\nslow fire, until the outer surface assumes a reddish colour. Before they\r\nare eaten, the balls are again moistened. These Indians are mostly wild,\r\nuncivilized men, who abhor all tillage. There is a proverb current among\r\nthe most distant of the tribes living on the Orinoco, when they wish to\r\nspeak of anything very unclean, “so dirty that the Otomacs eat it.”\r\n\r\nAs long as the waters of the Orinoco and the Meta are low, these people\r\nlive on fish and turtles. They kill the former with arrows, shooting the\r\nfish as they rise to the surface of the water with a skill and dexterity\r\nthat has frequently excited my admiration. At the periodical swelling of\r\nthe rivers, the fishing is stopped, for it is as difficult to fish in\r\ndeep river water as in the deep sea. It is during these intervals, which\r\nlast from two to three months, that the Otomacs are observed to devour\r\nan enormous quantity of earth. We found in their huts considerable\r\nstores of these clay balls piled up in pyramidal heaps. An Indian will\r\nconsume from three-quarters of a pound to a pound and a quarter of this\r\nfood daily, as we were assured by the intelligent monk, Fray Ramon\r\nBueno, a native of Madrid, who had lived among these Indians for a\r\nperiod of twelve years. According to the testimony of the Otomacs\r\nthemselves, this earth constitutes their main support in the rainy\r\nseason. In addition, they however eat, when they can procure them,\r\nlizards, several species of small fish, and the roots of a fern. But\r\nthey are so partial to clay, that even in the dry season, when there is\r\nan abundance of fish, they still partake of some of their earth-balls,\r\nby way of a _bonne bouche_ after their regular meals.\r\n\r\nThese people are of a dark, copper-brown colour, have unpleasant\r\nTartar-like features, and are stout, but not protuberant. The Franciscan\r\nwho had lived amongst them as a missionary, assured us that he had\r\nobserved no difference in the condition and well-being of the Otomacs\r\nduring the periods in which they lived on earth. The simple facts are\r\ntherefore as follows:—The Indians undoubtedly consume large quantities\r\nof clay without injuring their health; they regard this earth as a\r\nnutritious article of food, that is to say, they feel that it will\r\nsatisfy their hunger for a long time. This property they ascribe\r\nexclusively to the clay, and not to the other articles of food which\r\nthey contrive to procure from time to time in addition to it. If an\r\nOtomac be asked what are his winter provisions—the term winter in the\r\ntorrid parts of South America implying the rainy season—he will point to\r\nthe heaps of clay in his hut. These simple facts do not, however, by any\r\nmeans decide the questions: whether clay can actually be a nutritious\r\nsubstance; whether earths can be assimilated in the human body; whether\r\nthey only serve as ballast; or merely distend the walls of the stomach,\r\nand thus appease the cravings of hunger? These are questions which I\r\ncannot venture to decide.[HJ] It is singular, that Father Gumilla, who\r\nis generally so credulous and uncritical, should have denied the fact of\r\nearth being eaten by and for itself.[HK] He maintains that the\r\nclay-balls are largely mixed with maize-flour, and crocodile’s fat. But\r\nthe missionary Fray Ramon Bueno, and our friend and fellow-traveller,\r\nthe lay-brother Fray Juan Gonzales, who perished at sea off the coast of\r\nAfrica (at the time we lost a portion of our collections), both assured\r\nus, that the Otomacs never mix their clay cakes with crocodile’s fat,\r\nand we heard nothing in Uruana of the admixture of flour.\r\n\r\nThe earth which we brought with us, and which was chemically\r\ninvestigated by M. Vauquelin, is quite pure and unmixed. May not\r\nGumilla, by confounding heterogeneous facts, have intended to allude to\r\na preparation of bread from the long pod of a species of Inga? as this\r\nfruit is certainly buried in the earth, in order to hasten its\r\ndecomposition. It appears to me especially remarkable, that the Otomacs\r\nshould not lose their health by eating so much earth. Has this tribe\r\nbeen habituated for generations to this stimulus?\r\n\r\nIn all tropical countries men exhibit a wonderful and almost\r\nirresistible desire to devour earth, not the so-called alkaline or\r\ncalcareous earth, for the purpose of neutralizing acidity, but unctuous,\r\nstrong-smelling clay. It is often found necessary to shut children up in\r\norder to prevent their running into the open air to devour earth after\r\nrecent rain. The Indian women who are engaged on the river Magdalena, in\r\nthe small village of Banco, in turning earthenware pots, continually\r\nfill their mouths with large lumps of clay, as I have frequently\r\nobserved, much to my surprise.[HL] Wolves eat earth, especially clay,\r\nduring winter. It would be very important, in a physiological point of\r\nview, to examine the excrements of animals and men that eat earth.\r\nIndividuals of all other tribes, excepting the Otomacs, lose their\r\nhealth if they yield to this singular propensity for eating clay. In the\r\nmission of San Borja we found the child of an Indian woman, which,\r\naccording to the statement of its mother, would hardly eat anything but\r\nearth. It was, however, much emaciated, and looked like a mere skeleton.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that in the temperate and cold zones this morbid eagerness for\r\neating earth is so much less frequently manifested, and is indeed\r\nlimited almost entirely to children and pregnant women, whilst it would\r\nappear to be indigenous to the tropical lands of every quarter of the\r\nearth? In Guinea the negroes eat a yellowish earth, which they call\r\n_caouac_; and when they are carried as slaves to the West Indies they\r\neven endeavour there to procure for themselves some similar species of\r\nfood, maintaining that the eating of earth is perfectly harmless in\r\ntheir African home. The _caouac_ of the American islands, however,\r\nderanges the health of the slaves who partake of it; for which reason\r\nthe eating of earth was long since forbidden in the West Indies,\r\nnotwithstanding which a species of red or yellowish tuff (_un tuf rouge\r\njaunâtre_) was secretly sold in the public market of Martinique in the\r\nyear 1751.\r\n\r\n“The negroes of Guinea say that in their own country they _habitually_\r\neat a certain earth, the flavour of which is most agreeable to them, and\r\nwhich does not occasion them any inconvenience. Those who have addicted\r\nthemselves to the excessive use of _caouac_ are so partial to it, that\r\nno punishment can prevent them from devouring this earth.”[HM] In the\r\nisland of Java, between Sourabaya and Samarang, Labillardière saw small\r\nsquare reddish cakes publicly sold in the villages. The natives called\r\nthem _tana ampo_ (_tanah_ signifies earth in Malay and Javanese); and on\r\nexamining them more closely, he found that they were cakes made of a\r\nreddish clay, and intended for eating.[HN] The edible clay of Samarang\r\nhas recently (1847) beep sent, by Mohnike, to Berlin in the shape of\r\nrolled tubes like cinnamon, and has been examined by Ehrenberg. It is a\r\nfresh-water formation deposited in tertiary limestone, and composed of\r\nmicroscopic polygastrica (Gallionella, Navicula) and of\r\nPhytolitharia.[HO] The natives of New Caledonia, to appease their\r\nhunger, eat lumps as large as the fist of friable steatite, in which\r\nVauquelin detected an appreciable quantity of copper.[HP] In Popayan and\r\nmany parts of Peru calcareous earth is sold in the streets as an article\r\nof food for the Indians. This is eaten together with the Coca (the\r\nleaves of the _Erythroxylon peruvianum_). We thus find that the practice\r\nof eating earth is common throughout the whole of the torrid zone among\r\nthe indolent races who inhabit the most beautiful and fruitful regions\r\nof the earth. But accounts have also come from the north, through\r\nBerzelius and Retzius, from which we learn, that in the most remote\r\nparts of Sweden hundreds of cartloads of earth containing infusoria are\r\nannually consumed by the country people as bread-meal, more from fancy\r\n(like the smoking of tobacco) than from necessity. In some parts of\r\nFinland a similar kind of earth is mixed with the bread. It consists of\r\nempty shells of animalcules, so small and soft, that they break between\r\nthe teeth without any perceptible noise, filling the stomach without\r\nyielding any actual nourishment. Chronicles and archives often make\r\nmention during times of war of the employment as food of infusorial\r\nearth, which is spoken of under the indefinite and general term of\r\n“mountain meal.” Such, for instance, was the case in the Thirty Years’\r\nWar, at Camin in Pomerania, Muskau in the Lausitz, and Kleiken in the\r\nDessau territory; and subsequently in 1719 and 1733, at the fortress of\r\nWittenberg.[HQ]\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\np. 20.—“_Images graven in rocks._”\r\n\r\nIn the interior of South America, between the parallels of 2° and 4°\r\nnorth lat., lies a wooded plain inclosed by four rivers, the Orinoco,\r\nthe Atabapo, the Rio Negro, and the Cassiquiare. Here we find granitic\r\nand syenitic rocks, which, like those of Caicara and Uruana, are covered\r\nwith colossal symbolical figures of crocodiles, tigers, utensils of\r\ndomestic use, signs of the sun and moon, &c. This remote portion of the\r\nearth is at present wholly uninhabited throughout an extent of more than\r\n8000 square miles. The neighbouring tribes, who occupy the lowest place\r\nin the scale of humanity, are naked wandering savages, who could not\r\npossibly have carved hieroglyphics in stone. A whole range of these\r\nrocks covered with symbolical signs may be traced from Rupunuri,\r\nEssequibo, and the mountains of Pacaraima, to the banks of the Orinoco\r\nand of the Yupura, extending over more than eight degrees of longitude.\r\n\r\nThese carvings may belong to very different periods of time, for Sir\r\nRobert Schomburgk even found on the Rio Negro representations of a\r\nSpanish galliot,[HR] which must necessarily have been of a date\r\nsubsequent to the beginning of the sixteenth century, and that in a\r\nwilderness where the inhabitants were probably as rude then as they now\r\nare. But it must not be forgotten, as I have already elsewhere observed,\r\nthat nations of very different descent, but in similarly uncivilized\r\nconditions, possessed of the same disposition to simplify and generalize\r\noutlines, and urged by identical inherent mental tendencies, may be led\r\nto produce similar signs and symbols.[HS]\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the Society of Antiquaries in London a memoir was read\r\non the 17th of November, 1836, by Sir Robert Schomburgk, “On the\r\nreligious traditions of the Macusi Indians, who inhabit the Upper Mahu,\r\nand a portion of the Pacaraima mountains,” and who have therefore not\r\nchanged their habitation for a century (since the journey of the\r\nintrepid Hortsmann). “The Macusis,” says Sir Robert Schomburgk, “believe\r\nthat the only being who survived a general deluge, repeopled the earth\r\nby converting stones into human beings.” This myth, which is the fruit\r\nof the lively imagination of these tribes, and which reminds us of that\r\nof Deucalion and Pyrrha, shows itself in a somewhat modified form among\r\nthe Tamanacs of the Orinoco. When these people are asked how the human\r\nrace survived this great flood, _the age of waters_ of the Mexicans,\r\nthey unhesitatingly reply, “that one man and one woman were saved by\r\ntaking refuge on the summit of the lofty mountain of Tamanacu, on the\r\nbanks of the Asiveru, and that they then threw over their heads the\r\nfruits of the Mauritia palm, from the kernels of which sprang men and\r\nwomen, who again peopled the earth.” Some miles from Encaramada there\r\nrises in the midst of the savannah the rock of Tepu-Mereme; _i.e._, the\r\n“painted rock,” which exhibits numerous figures of animals and\r\nsymbolical signs, having much resemblance to those which we observed at\r\nsome distance above Encaramada, near Caycara. (7° 5′ to 7° 40′ north\r\nlat., and 66° 28′ to 67° 23′ west long.) Similarly carved rocks are\r\nfound between the Cassiquiare and the Atabapo (2° 5′ to 3° 20′ lat.);\r\nand what is most striking, also 560 miles further eastward in the\r\nsolitudes of the Parime. The last-named fact is proved beyond a doubt,\r\nby the journal of Nicolas Hortsmann of Hildesheim, of which I have seen\r\na copy in the handwriting of the celebrated d’Anville. That simple and\r\nmodest traveller wrote down every day on the spot whatever had struck\r\nhim as worthy of notice; and his narrative deserves perhaps the more\r\nconfidence from the fact that the great disappointment he experienced in\r\nhaving failed in the object of his researches, which was the discovery\r\nof the Lake of Dorado, with its lumps of gold and a diamond mine (which\r\nproved to be merely rock crystal of a very pure kind), led him to look\r\nwith a certain degree of contempt on all that fell in his way. On the\r\nbank of the Rupunuri, at the point where the river, winding between the\r\nMacarana mountains, forms several small cascades; and before reaching\r\nthe country immediately surrounding the Lake of Amucu, he found, on the\r\n16th of April, 1749, “rocks covered with figures,” or, as he says in\r\nPortuguese, “_de varias letras_” (with various letters or characters).\r\nWe were shown, at the rock of Culimacari, on the banks of the\r\nCassiquiare, signs said to be characters drawn by line and rule: but\r\nthey were merely ill-formed figures of the heavenly bodies, crocodiles,\r\nboa-constrictors, and utensils used in the preparation of manioc-meal. I\r\nfound among these painted rocks (_piedras pintadas_) neither a\r\nsymmetrical arrangement nor any trace of characters drawn with a regard\r\nto regularity in space and size. The word “_letras_” in the journal of\r\nthe German Surgeon (Hortsmann) must not, therefore, I am disposed to\r\nthink, be taken in the strictest sense.\r\n\r\nSchomburgk did not succeed in finding the rocks observed by Hortsmann,\r\nbut he has described others which he saw on the bank of the Essequibo,\r\nnear the cascade of Waraputa. “This cascade,” he says, “is celebrated\r\nnot only for its height, but also for the great number of figures hewn\r\nin the rock, which bear a great resemblance to those that I have seen on\r\nthe island of St. John, (one of the Virgin Islands,) and which I\r\nconsider to be without doubt the work of the Caribs, by whom this part\r\nof the Antilles was peopled in former times. I made the most strenuous\r\nefforts to hew away a portion of the rock carved with inscriptions,\r\nwhich I was desirous of taking with me; but the stone was too hard, and\r\nmy strength had been wasted by fever. Neither threats nor promises could\r\nprevail on the Indians to aim a single stroke of the hammer against\r\nthese rocks—the venerable monuments of the culture and superior skill of\r\ntheir forefathers. They regard them as the work of the Great Spirit; and\r\nall the different tribes we met were acquainted with them, although\r\nliving at a great distance. Terror was painted on the faces of my Indian\r\ncompanions who seemed to expect every moment that the fire of heaven\r\nwould fall on my head. I now saw clearly that all my efforts were\r\nfruitless, and I was therefore obliged to content myself with bringing\r\naway a complete drawing of these monuments.”\r\n\r\nThe last resolution was undoubtedly the best, and the editor of the\r\nEnglish journal, to my great satisfaction, subjoins in a note the\r\nremark, “that it is to be wished that others may succeed no better than\r\nSchomburgk, and that no traveller belonging to a civilized nation will\r\nin future attempt the destruction of these monuments of the unprotected\r\nIndians.”\r\n\r\nThe symbolical signs which Sir Robert Schomburgk found in the fluvial\r\nvalley of the Essequibo, near the rapids of Waraputa,[HT] resemble,\r\nindeed, according to his observation, the genuine Carib carvings of one\r\nof the smaller Virgin Islands (St. John); but notwithstanding the wide\r\nextent of the Carib invasions, and the ancient power of that fine race,\r\nI cannot believe that this vast belt of carved rocks which intersects a\r\ngreat portion of South America from west to east, is actually to be\r\nascribed to the Caribs. These remains seem rather to be traces of an\r\nancient civilization, which may have belonged to an epoch when the\r\ntribes, whom we now distinguish by various names and races, were still\r\nunknown. The veneration which is everywhere shown by the Indians for\r\nthese rude carvings of their predecessors, proves that the present races\r\nhave no idea of the execution of similar works. Nay, more than this,\r\nbetween Encaramada and Caycara, on the banks of the Orinoco, many of\r\nthese hieroglyphic figures are found sculptured on the sides of rocks at\r\na height which can now only be reached by means of extremely high\r\nscaffolding. When asked who can have carved these figures, the natives\r\nanswer with a smile, as if it were a fact of which none but a white man\r\ncould be ignorant, that “in the days of the great waters their fathers\r\nsailed in canoes at this height.” Here we find a geological dream\r\nserving as a solution of the problem presented by a long extinct\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nI would here be permitted to subjoin a remark, which I borrow from a\r\nletter addressed to me by Sir Robert Schomburgk, the distinguished\r\ntraveller already mentioned. “The hieroglyphic figures are much more\r\nwidely extended than you probably have conjectured. During my\r\nexpedition, the object of which was the exploration of the river\r\nCorentyn, I not only observed several gigantic figures on the rock of\r\nTimeri (4° 30′ north lat. and 57° 30′ west long.), but I also discovered\r\nsimilar ones in the vicinity of the great cataracts of the river\r\nCorentyn (in 4° 21′ 30″ north lat. and 57° 55′ 30″ west long.) These\r\nfigures have been executed more carefully than any others which I met\r\nwith in Guiana. They are about 12 feet in height and appear to represent\r\nhuman figures. The head-gear is extremely remarkable; it surrounds the\r\nentire head, spreads far out, and is not unlike the glory represented\r\nround the heads of Saints. I left drawings of these images in the\r\ncolony, which I hope some day to be able to lay collectively before the\r\npublic. I have seen less complete figures on the Cuyuwini, a river\r\nwhich, flowing from the north-west, empties itself into the Essequibo in\r\n2° 16′ north lat.; and I subsequently found similar figures on the\r\nEssequibo itself in 1° 40′ north lat. These figures, therefore, as\r\nappears from actual observations, extend from 7° 10′ to 1° 40′ north\r\nlat., and from 57° 30′ to 66° 30′ west long. The zone (or belt) of the\r\nsculptured rocks (as far as it has yet been investigated) thus extends\r\nover an area of 192,000 square miles, and includes within its circuit\r\nthe basins of the Corentyn, Essequibo, and Orinoco—a circumstance that\r\nenables us to judge of the former population of this portion of the\r\ncontinent.”\r\n\r\nRemarkable relics of a former culture, consisting of granitic vessels\r\nornamented with beautiful representations of labyrinths, and the\r\nearthenware forms resembling the Roman masks, have been discovered among\r\nthe wild Indians on the Mosquito coast.[HU] I had them engraved in the\r\npicturesque Atlas appended to the historical portion of my travels.\r\nAntiquarians are astonished at the resemblance of these _algreco_\r\nvessels to those which embellish the Palace of Mitla (near Oaxaca, in\r\nNew Spain). The large-nosed race, who are so frequently sculptured in\r\nrelief on the Palenque of Guatimala and in Aztec pictures, I have never\r\nobserved in Peruvian carvings. Klaproth recollects having noticed that\r\nthe Chalkas, a horde of Northern Mongolia, had similar large noses. It\r\nis universally known, that many races of the North American, Canadian,\r\nand copper-coloured Indians, have fine aquiline noses, which constitute\r\nan essential physiognomical mark of distinction between them and the\r\npresent inhabitants of New Granada, Quito, and Peru. Are the large-eyed,\r\nfair-skinned natives of the north-west coast of America, of whom\r\nMarchand speaks as living in 54° and 58° north lat., descended from the\r\nUsuns, an Alano-Gothic race of Central Asia?\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\np. 20.—“_Deal certain death with a poisoned thumb-nail._”\r\n\r\nThe Otomacs frequently poison their thumb-nails with _curare_. The mere\r\nimpress of the nail proves fatal, should the curare become mixed with\r\nthe blood. We have in our possession the creeping plant, from the juice\r\nof which the curare is prepared, in the Esmeralda Mission, on the Upper\r\nOrinoco, but, unfortunately, we did not find the plant when in blossom.\r\nFrom its physiognomy, it seems to be allied to _Strychnos_.[HV]\r\n\r\nSince I wrote the above notice of the _Curare_, or _Urari_, as the plant\r\nand poison were called by Raleigh, the brothers Robert and Richard\r\nSchomburgk have rendered important service to science by making us\r\naccurately acquainted with the nature and mode of preparing this\r\nsubstance, which I was the first to bring to Europe in any considerable\r\nquantity. Richard Schomburgk found this creeping plant in flower in\r\nGuiana, on the banks of the Pomeroon and Sururu, in the territory of the\r\nCaribs, who are, however, ignorant of the mode of preparing the poison.\r\nHis instructive work[HW] gives the chemical analysis of the juice of the\r\n_Strychnos toxifera_, which, notwithstanding its name and organic\r\nstructure, contains, according to Boussingault, no trace of strychnine.\r\nVirchow’s and Münter’s interesting physiological experiments show that\r\nthe curare or urari poison does not appear to destroy by resorption from\r\nwithout, but chiefly when it is absorbed by the animal substance after\r\nthe separation of the continuity of the latter; that curare does not\r\nbelong to tetanic poisons; and that it especially produces paralysis,\r\n_i.e._, a cessation of voluntary muscular movement, while the function\r\nof the involuntary muscles (as the heart and intestines) continues\r\nunimpaired.[HX]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ON THE CATARACTS OF THE ORINOCO,\r\n                      _Near Atures and Maypures_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding section, which I made the subject of an Academical\r\nLecture, I have delineated those boundless plains, whose natural character\r\nis so variously modified by climatic relations, that what in one region\r\nappear as barren treeless wastes or deserts, in another are Steppes or\r\nfar-stretching Prairies. With the Llanos of the southern portion of the\r\nNew Continent, may be contrasted the fearful sandy deserts in the interior\r\nof Africa; and these again with the Steppes of Central Asia, the\r\nhabitation of those world-storming herdsmen, who, once pouring forth from\r\nthe east, spread barbarism and devastation over the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhile on that occasion (1806), I ventured to combine many massive features\r\nin one grand picture of nature, and endeavoured to entertain a public\r\nassembly with subjects, somewhat in accordance with the gloomy condition\r\nof our minds at that period, I will now, confining myself to a more\r\nlimited circle of phenomena, pourtray in brighter tints the cheerful\r\npicture of a luxuriant vegetation, and fluvial valleys with their foaming\r\nmountain torrents. I will describe two scenes of Nature from the wild\r\nregions of Guiana,—ATURES and MAYPURES, the far-famed CATARACTS OF THE\r\nORINOCO,—which, previously to my own travels, had been visited by few\r\nEuropeans.\r\n\r\nThe impression which is left on the mind by the aspect of natural scenery\r\nis less determined by the peculiar character of the region, than by the\r\nvaried nature of the light through which we view, or mountain or plain,\r\nsometimes beaming beneath an azure sky, sometimes enveloped in the gloom\r\nof lowering clouds. Thus, too, descriptions of nature affect us more or\r\nless powerfully, in proportion as they harmonize with the condition of our\r\nown feelings. For the physical world is reflected with truth and animation\r\non the inner susceptible world of the mind. Whatever marks the character\r\nof a landscape: the profile of mountains, which in the far and hazy\r\ndistance bound the horizon; the deep gloom of pine forests; the mountain\r\ntorrent, which rushes headlong to its fall through overhanging cliffs: all\r\nstand alike in an ancient and mysterious communion with the spiritual life\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nFrom this communion arises the nobler portion of the enjoyment which\r\nnature affords. Nowhere does she more deeply impress us with a sense of\r\nher greatness, nowhere does she speak to us more forcibly than in the\r\ntropical world, beneath the “Indian sky,” as the climate of the torrid\r\nzone was called in the early period of the Middle Ages. While I now,\r\ntherefore, venture to give a delineation of these regions, I am encouraged\r\nto hope that the peculiar charm which belongs to them will not be unfelt.\r\nThe remembrance of a distant and richly endowed land, the aspect of a free\r\nand powerful vegetation, refreshes and strengthens the mind; even as our\r\nsoaring spirit, oppressed with the cares of the present, turns with\r\ndelight to contemplate the early dawn of mankind and its simple\r\ngrandeur.[HY]\r\n\r\nWestern currents and tropical winds favour the passage over that pacific\r\narm of the sea[53] which occupies the vast valley stretching between the\r\nNew Continent and Western Africa. Before the shore is seen to emerge from\r\nthe highly curved expanse of waters, a foaming rush of conflicting and\r\nintermingling waves is observed. The mariner who is unacquainted with this\r\nregion would suspect the vicinity of shoals, or a wonderful burst of fresh\r\nsprings, such as occur in the midst of the Ocean among the Antilles[54].\r\n\r\nOn approaching nearer to the granitic shores of Guiana, he sees before him\r\nthe wide mouth of a mighty river, which gushes forth like a shoreless sea,\r\nflooding the ocean around with fresh water. The green waves of the river,\r\nwhich assume a milky white hue as they foam over the shoals, contrast with\r\nthe indigo-blue of the sea, which marks the waters of the river in sharp\r\noutlines.\r\n\r\nThe name Orinoco, which the first discoverers gave to this river, and\r\nwhich probably owes its origin to some confusion of language, is unknown\r\nin the interior of the country. For in their condition of animal rudeness,\r\nsavage tribes only designate by peculiar geographical names, those objects\r\nwhich might be confounded with others. Thus the Orinoco, the Amazon, and\r\nthe Magdalena, are each simply termed _The River_, the _Great River_, and\r\n_The Great Water_; whilst, those who dwell on the banks of even the\r\nsmallest streams distinguish them by special names.\r\n\r\nThe current produced by the Orinoco between the South American Continent\r\nand the asphaltic island of Trinidad is so powerful, that ships, with all\r\ntheir canvass spread, and a westerly breeze in their favour, can scarcely\r\nmake way against it. This desolate and fearful spot is called the Bay of\r\nSadness (_Golfo Triste_), and its entrance the _Dragon’s Mouth_ (_Boca del\r\nDrago_). Here isolated cliffs rise tower-like in the midst of the rushing\r\nstream. They seem to mark the old rocky barrier[55] which, before it was\r\nbroken through by the current, connected the island of Trinidad with the\r\ncoast of Paria.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of this region first convinced the bold navigator Columbus\r\nof the existence of an American continent. “Such an enormous body of fresh\r\nwater,” concluded this acute observer of nature, “could only be collected\r\nfrom a river having a long course; the land, therefore, which supplied it\r\nmust be a continent, and not an island.” As, according to Arrian, the\r\ncompanions of Alexander, when they penetrated across the snow-crowned\r\nsummits of Paropanisus[56], believed that they recognized in the\r\ncrocodile-teeming Indus a part of the Nile,[HZ] so Columbus, in his\r\nignorance of the similarity of physiognomy which characterises all the\r\nproducts of the climate of palms, imagined that the New Continent was the\r\neastern coast of the far projecting Asia. The grateful coolness of the\r\nevening air, the ethereal purity of the starry firmament, the balmy\r\nfragrance of flowers, wafted to him by the land breeze—all led him to\r\nsuppose. (as we are told by Herrera, in the Decades[57],) that he was\r\napproaching the garden of Eden, the sacred abode of our first parents. The\r\nOrinoco seemed to him one of the four rivers, which, according to the\r\nvenerable tradition of the ancient world, flowed from Paradise, to water\r\nand divide the surface of the earth, newly adorned with plants. This\r\npoetical passage in the Journal of Columbus, or rather in a letter to\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, written from Haiti in October, 1498, presents a\r\npeculiar psychological interest. It teaches us anew, that the creative\r\nfancy of the poet manifests itself in the discoverer of a world, no less\r\nthan in every other form of human greatness.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the great mass of water poured into the Atlantic Ocean by\r\nthe Orinoco, we are naturally led to ask which of the South American\r\nrivers is the greatest—the Orinoco, the Amazon, or the La Plata? The\r\nquestion is as indeterminate as the idea of greatness itself. The Rio de\r\nla Plata has undoubtedly the widest mouth, its width measuring 92 miles\r\nacross; but this river, like those of Great Britain, is comparatively of\r\nbut inconsiderable length. Its shallowness, too, is so great as to impede\r\nnavigation at Buenos Ayres. The Amazon, which is the longest of all\r\nrivers, measures 2880 miles from its rise in the Lake of Lauricocha to its\r\nestuary. Yet its width in the province of Jaen de Bracamoros, near the\r\ncataract of Rentama, where I measured it at the foot of the picturesque\r\nmountain of Patachuma, is scarcely equal to that of the Rhine at Mayence.\r\n\r\nThe Orinoco is narrower at its mouth than either the La Plata or the\r\nAmazon, while its length, according to my astronomical observations, does\r\nnot exceed 1120 geographical miles. But in the interior of Guiana, 560\r\nmiles from its estuary, I found that at high water the width of the river\r\nmeasured upwards of 17,265 feet. Its periodical swelling here raises the\r\nlevel of the waters every year from 30 to 36 feet above the lowest\r\nwater-mark. We are still without sufficient data for an accurate\r\ncomparison between the enormous rivers which traverse the South American\r\nContinent. For such a comparison it would be necessary to ascertain the\r\nprofile of the river-bed, as well as the velocity of the water, which\r\nvaries very considerably at different points.\r\n\r\nIf the Orinoco, in the Delta formed by its variously divided and still\r\nunexplored branches, as well as in the regularity of its rise and fall,\r\nand in the number and size of its crocodiles, exhibits numerous points of\r\nresemblance to the Nile; there is this further analogy between the two\r\nrivers, that they for a long distance wind their impetuous way, like\r\nforest torrents, between granitic and syenitic rocks, till, slowly rolling\r\ntheir waters over an almost horizontal bed, skirted by treeless banks,\r\nthey reach the sea.\r\n\r\nAn arm of the Nile (the Green Nile, Bahr-el-Azrek), from the celebrated\r\nmountain lake, near Gondar, in the Gojam Alps, in Abyssinia, to Syene and\r\nElephantis, winds its way through the mountain range of Schangalla and\r\nSennar; and in like manner the Orinoco rises on the southern slope of a\r\nmountain chain, which stretches between the parallels of 4° and 5° north\r\nlat., from French Guiana, in a westerly direction towards the Andes of New\r\nGranada. The sources of the Orinoco have never been visited by any\r\nEuropean[58], nor even by any natives who have held intercourse with\r\nEuropeans.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the summer of 1800, we ascended the Upper Orinoco, we passed the\r\nmission of Esmeralda, and reached the mouths of the Sodomoni and the\r\nGuapo. Here soars high above the clouds, the mighty peak of the Yeonnamari\r\nor Duida; a mountain which presents one of the grandest spectacles in the\r\nnatural scenery of the tropical world. Its altitude, according to my\r\ntrigonometrical measurement, is 8278 (8823 English) feet above the level\r\nof the sea. Its southern slope is a treeless grassy plain, redolent with\r\nthe odour of pine-apples, whose fragrance scents the humid evening air.\r\nAmong lowly meadow plants rise the juicy stems of the _anana_, whose\r\ngolden yellow fruit gleams from the midst of a bluish green diadem of\r\nleaves. Where the mountain springs break forth from beneath the grassy\r\ncovering, rise isolated groups of lofty fan-palms, whose leaves, in this\r\ntorrid region, are never stirred by a cooling breeze.\r\n\r\nTo the east of the Duida mountain, begins a thicket of wild cacao trees,\r\namong which are found the celebrated almond tree, _Bertholletia excelsa_,\r\nthe most luxurious product of a tropical vegetation[59]. Here the Indians\r\ncollect colossal stalks of grass, whose joints measure upwards of 18 feet\r\nfrom knot to knot, which they use as blow-pipes for the discharge of their\r\narrows[60]. Some Franciscan monks have penetrated as far as the mouth of\r\nthe Chiguire, where the river is already so narrow that the natives have\r\nsuspended over it, near the waterfall of the Guaharibes, a bridge woven of\r\nthe stems of twining plants. The Guaicas, of palish complexion and short\r\nstature, armed with poisoned arrows, oppose all further progress eastward.\r\n\r\nTherefore, all that has been advanced to prove that the Orinoco derives\r\nits source from a lake must be regarded as a fable[61]. In vain the\r\ntraveller seeks to discover the Lake of El Dorado, which, in Arrowsmith’s\r\nmaps, is set down as an inland sea measuring upwards of 20 geographical\r\n(80 English) miles. Can the little reed-covered lake of Amucu, near which\r\nrises the Pirara (a branch of the Mahu), have given rise to this myth?\r\nThis swamp lies, however, 4° to the east of the region in which we may\r\nsuppose the sources of the Orinoco to be situated. Here tradition placed\r\nthe island of Pumacena, a rock of micaceous schist, whose shining\r\nbrightness has played a memorable, and, for the deluded adventurers, often\r\na fatal, part in the fable of _El Dorado_, current since the sixteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAccording to the belief of many of the natives, the Magellanic clouds of\r\nthe southern sky, and even the glorious nebulæ in the constellation Argo,\r\nare mere reflections of the metallic brilliancy of these silver mountains\r\nof the Parime. It was besides an ancient custom of dogmatising geographers\r\nto make all the most considerable rivers of the world originate in lakes.\r\n\r\nThe Orinoco is one of those remarkable rivers which, after numerous\r\nwindings, first towards the west and then to the north, finally return\r\ntowards the east in such a manner as to bring both its estuary and its\r\nsource into nearly the same meridian. From the Chiguire and the Gehette as\r\nfar as the Guaviare, the course of the Orinoco inclines westward, as if it\r\nwould pour its waters into the Pacific. Here branches off to the south,\r\nthe Cassiquiare, a remarkable river, but little known to Europeans, which\r\nunites with the Rio Negro, or as the natives call it, the Guainia:\r\nfurnishing the only example of a bifurcation which forms in the very\r\ninterior of a continent a natural connection between two great river\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the soil, and the junction of the Guaviare and Atabapo with\r\nthe Orinoco, cause the latter to deflect suddenly northwards. From a want\r\nof correct geographical data, the Guaviare, flowing in from the west, was\r\nlong regarded as the true source of the Orinoco. The doubts advanced since\r\n1797 by an eminent geographer, M. Buache, regarding the possibility of a\r\nconnection with the Amazon, have, I trust, been completely set at rest by\r\nmy expedition. In an uninterrupted voyage of 920 miles, I penetrated\r\nthrough a remarkable net-work of rivers, from the Rio Negro, along the\r\nCassiquiare, into the Orinoco; across the interior of the continent, from\r\nthe Brazilian boundary to the coast of Caracas.\r\n\r\nIn the upper portion of this fluvial district, between 3° and 4° north\r\nlat., nature has exhibited, at many different points, the puzzling\r\nphenomenon of the so-called _black waters_. The Atabapo, whose banks are\r\nadorned with _Carolinias_ and arborescent _Melastomas_, the Temi, Tuamini,\r\nand Guainia, are all rivers of a brown or coffee colour, which, under the\r\ndeep shade of the palms, assumes a blackish, inky tint. When placed in a\r\ntransparent vessel, the water appears of a golden yellow colour. These\r\nblack streams reflect the images of the southern stars with the most\r\nremarkable clearness. Where the waters flow gently they afford the\r\nastronomer, who is making observations with reflecting instruments, a most\r\nexcellent artificial horizon.\r\n\r\nAn absence of crocodiles as well as of fish—greater coolness—less torment\r\nfrom stinging mosquitoes—and salubrity of atmosphere, characterize the\r\nregion of the black rivers. They probably owe their singular colour to a\r\nsolution of carburetted hydrogen, to the rich luxuriance of tropical\r\nvegetation, and to the abundance of plants on the soil over which they\r\nflow. Indeed, I have observed that on the western declivity of the\r\nChimborazo, towards the shores of the Pacific, the overflowing waters of\r\nthe Rio de Guayaquil gradually assume a golden yellow, approaching to a\r\ncoffee colour, after they have covered the meadows for several weeks.\r\n\r\nNear the mouths of the Guaviare and Atapabo grows one of the noblest forms\r\nof the palm-tree, the Piriguao[62], whose smooth stem, which is nearly 70\r\nfeet in height, is adorned with delicate flag-like leaves having curled\r\nmargins. I know no palm which bears equally large and beautifully coloured\r\nfruits. They resemble peaches in their blended tints of yellow and\r\ncrimson. Seventy or eighty of these form one enormous cluster, of which\r\neach stem annually ripens three. This noble tree might be termed the\r\npeach-palm. It s fleshy fruit, owing to the extreme luxuriance of\r\nvegetation, is generally devoid of seed; and it yields the natives a\r\nnutritious and farinaceous article of food which, like the banana and the\r\npotato, is capable of being prepared in many different ways.\r\n\r\nTo this point, that is, as far as the mouth of the Guaviare, the Orinoco\r\nflows along the southern declivity of the chain of the Parime. From its\r\nleft bank, across the equator, and as far us the parallel of 15° south\r\nlat., extends the boundless wooded plain of the river Amazon. At San\r\nFernando de Atabapo the Orinoco, turning off abruptly in a northerly\r\ndirection, intersects a portion of the mountain chain itself. Here are the\r\ngreat waterfalls of Atures and Maypures, and here the bed of the river is\r\neverywhere contracted by colossal masses of rocks, which give it the\r\nappearance of being divided by natural dams into separate reservoirs.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the Meta stands, in the midst of an enormous whirlpool,\r\nan isolated rock, which the natives very aptly term the “Rock of\r\nPatience,” because when the waters are low, it sometimes retards for two\r\nwhole days the ascent of the navigator. Here the Orinoco, biting deep into\r\nits shores, forms picturesque rocky bays. Opposite the Indian mission of\r\nCarichana, the traveller is surprised by a most remarkable prospect.\r\nInvoluntarily his eye is arrested by a steep granite rock, “El Mogote de\r\nCocuyza,” a cubiform mass, which rises precipitously to a height of more\r\nthan 200 feet; and whose summit is crowned with a luxuriant forest. Like a\r\nCyclopic monument of simple grandeur, this bold promontory towers high\r\nabove the tops of the surrounding palms, cutting the deep azure of the sky\r\nwith its strongly marked outlines, and lifting, as it were, forest upon\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nOn descending beyond Carichana, the traveller arrives at a point where the\r\nriver has opened itself a passage through the narrow pass of Baraguan.\r\nHere we everywhere recognise traces of chaotic devastation. To the north,\r\ntowards Uruana and Encaramada, rise granite rocks of grotesque appearance,\r\nwhich, in singularly formed crags of dazzling whiteness, gleam brightly\r\nfrom amidst the surrounding groves.\r\n\r\nAt this point, near the mouth of the Apure, the stream leaves the granitic\r\nchain, and flowing eastward, separates as far as the Atlantic, the\r\nimpenetrable forests of Guiana from the Savannahs, on whose far distant\r\nhorizon the vault of heaven seems to rest. Thus the Orinoco surrounds on\r\nthe south, west, and north, the high mountain chain of the Parime, which\r\noccupies the vast space between the sources of the Jao and of the Caura.\r\nNo cliffs or rapids obstruct the course of the river from Carichana to its\r\nmouth, excepting, indeed, the “Hell’s Mouth” (Boca del Inferno) near\r\nMuitaco, a whirlpool occasioned by rocks, as at Atures and Maypures, which\r\ndoes not, however, block up the whole breadth of the stream. In this\r\ndistrict, which is contiguous to the sea, the only dangers encountered by\r\nthe boatmen arise from the natural timber-floats, against which canoes are\r\noften wrecked at night. These floats consist of forest trees which have\r\nbeen uprooted and torn away from the banks by the rising of the waters.\r\nThey are covered, like meadows, with blooming water-plants, and remind us\r\nof the floating gardens of the Mexican lakes.\r\n\r\nAfter this brief glance at the course of the Orinoco and its general\r\nfeatures, I pass to the waterfalls of Maypures and Atures.\r\n\r\nFrom the high mountain-group of Cunavami, between the sources of the\r\nrivers Sipapo and Ventuari, a granite ridge projects to the far west\r\ntowards the mountain of Uniama. From this ridge descend four streams,\r\nwhich mark, as it were, the limits of the cataracts of Maypures; two bound\r\nSipapo and Sanariapo, on the eastern shore of the Orinoco; and two the\r\nCameji and Toparo, on the western side. At the site of the missionary\r\nvillage of Maypures the mountains form a wide bay opening towards the\r\nsouth-west.\r\n\r\nHere the stream rushes foaming down the eastern declivity of the mountain,\r\nwhile far to the west traces remain of the ancient and now forsaken bank\r\nof the river. An extensive Savannah stretches between the two chains of\r\nhills, at an elevation of scarcely 30 feet above the upper water-level of\r\nthe river, and here the Jesuits have erected a small church formed of the\r\ntrunks of palms.\r\n\r\nThe geognostical aspect of this region, the insular form of the rocks of\r\nKeri and Oco, the cavities worn in the former by the current, and which\r\nare situated at exactly the same level as those in the opposite island of\r\nUivitari; all these indications tend to prove that the Orinoco once filled\r\nthe whole of this now dried-up bay. It is probable that the waters formed\r\na wide lake, as long as the northern dam withstood their passage. When\r\nthis barrier gave way, the Savannah now inhabited by the Guareke Indians\r\nemerged as an island. The river may perhaps long after this have continued\r\nto surround the rocks of Keri and Oco, which now picturesquely project,\r\nlike castellated fortresses, from its ancient bed. After the gradual\r\ndiminution of the waters, the river withdrew wholly to the eastern side of\r\nthe mountain chain.\r\n\r\nThis conjecture is confirmed by various circumstances. Thus, for instance,\r\nthe Orinoco, like the Nile at Philæ and Syene, has the singular property\r\nof colouring black the reddish-white masses of granite, over which it has\r\nflowed for thousands of years. As far as the waters reach one observes on\r\nthe rocky shore a leaden-coloured manganeseous and perhaps carbonaceous\r\ncoating which has penetrated scarcely onetenth of a line into the stone.\r\nThis black coloration, and the cavities already alluded to, show the\r\nformer water level of the Orinoco.\r\n\r\nThese black cavities may be traced at elevations of from 160 to 192 feet\r\nabove the present level of the river on the rocks of Keri, in the islands\r\nof the cataracts; in the gneiss-like hills of Cumadanimari, which extend\r\nabove the island of Tomo; and lastly at the mouth of the Jao. Their\r\nexistence proves, what indeed we learn from all the river-beds of Europe,\r\nthat those streams which still excite our admiration by their magnitude,\r\nare but inconsiderable remains of the immense masses of water belonging to\r\na former age.\r\n\r\nThese simple facts have not escaped even the rude natives of Guiana.\r\nEverywhere the Indians drew our attention to these traces of the ancient\r\nwater-level. Nay, in a Savannah near Uruana there rises an isolated rock\r\nof granite, which, according to the testimony of persons worthy of credit,\r\nexhibits at an elevation of between 80 and 90 feet, a series of figures of\r\nthe sun and moon, and of various animals, especially crocodiles and\r\nboa-constrictors, graven, almost in rows. At the present day this\r\nperpendicular rock, which well deserves the careful examination of future\r\ntravellers, cannot be ascended without the aid of scaffolding. In a\r\nsimilarly remarkable elevated position, the traveller can trace\r\nhieroglyphic characters carved on the mountains of Uruana and Encaramada.\r\n\r\nIf the natives are asked how these characters could have been graven\r\nthere, they answer that it was done in former times, when the waters were\r\nso high that their fathers’ canoes floated at that elevation. Such lofty\r\ncondition of the water level must therefore have been coeval with these\r\nrude memorials of human skill. It indicates an ancient distribution of\r\nland and water over the surface of the globe widely different from that\r\nwhich now exists; but which must not be confounded with that condition\r\nwhen the primeval vegetation of our planet, the colossal remains of\r\nextinct terrestrial animals, and the oceanic creatures of a chaotic world,\r\nfound one common grave in the indurating crust of our earth.\r\n\r\nAt the most northern extremity of the cataracts our attention is attracted\r\nby what are called the natural representations of the Sun and Moon. The\r\nrock of Keri, to which I have more than once referred, derives its name\r\nfrom a glistening white spot seen at a considerable distance, and in which\r\nthe Indians profess to recognize a striking resemblance to the disc of the\r\nfull moon. I was not myself able to climb this precipitous rock, but it\r\nseems probable that the white spot is a large knot of quartz, formed by a\r\ncluster of veins in the greyish-black granite.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the Keri rock, on the twin mountain of the island of Uivitari,\r\nwhich has a basaltic appearance, the Indians point, with mysterious\r\nadmiration, to a similar disc, which they venerate as the image of the\r\nSun, _Camosi_. The geographical position of these two rocks may have\r\ncontributed to their respective appellations, for I found that Keri was\r\nturned towards the west, and Camosi towards the east. Some etymological\r\ninquirers have thought they could recognize an analogy between the\r\nAmerican word Camosi and the word Camosh, a name applied in one of the\r\nPhœnician dialects to the sun, and identical with the Apollo Chomeus or\r\nBeelphegor and Amun.\r\n\r\nThe lofty falls of Niagara, which are 150 feet in height, derive their\r\norigin, as is well known, from the combined precipitation of one enormous\r\nmass of water. Such, however, is not the case with respect to the\r\ncataracts of Maypures, nor are they narrow straits or passes through which\r\nthe stream rushes with increasing velocity, like the Pongo of Manseriche\r\non the Amazon, but rather to be regarded as a countless number of small\r\ncascades succeeding each other like steps. The _Raudal_, (as the Spaniards\r\nterm this kind of cataract,) is formed by an archipelago of islands and\r\nrocks, which so contract the bed of the river that its natural width of\r\nmore than 8500 feet is often reduced to a channel scarcely navigable to\r\nthe extent of 20 feet. At the present day the eastern side is far less\r\naccessible and far more dangerous than the western.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the Cameji the boatmen unload their cargo that they may\r\nleave the empty canoe, or, as it is here called, the _Piragua_, to be\r\npiloted by Indians well acquainted with the Raudal, as far as the mouth of\r\nthe Toparo, where all danger is supposed to be past. Where the rocks or\r\nshelvy ledges, (each of which has its particular name,) are not above two\r\nor three feet in height, the natives venture to shoot the rapid with their\r\ncanoes. When, however, they have to ascend the stream, they swim in\r\nadvance of the piragua, and after much labour, and, perhaps, many\r\nunsuccessful efforts, succeed in throwing a rope round a point of rock\r\nprojecting above the breakers, and by this means draw the canoe against\r\nthe stream, which, in this arduous operation, is often water-logged, or\r\nupset.\r\n\r\nSometimes the canoe is dashed to pieces on the rock, and this is the only\r\ndanger the natives fear. With bleeding bodies they then strain every nerve\r\nto escape the fury of the whirlpool and swim to land. Where the rocky\r\nledges are very high and form a barrier by extending across the entire bed\r\nof the river, the light canoe is hauled to land and dragged for some\r\ndistance along the shore on branches of trees which serve the purpose of\r\nrollers.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated and most perilous ledges are those of Purimarimi and\r\nManimi, which are between nine and ten feet in height. It was with\r\nsurprise I found, by barometrical measurements, that the entire fall of\r\nthe Raudal, from the mouth of the Cameji to that of the Toparo, scarcely\r\namounted to more than 30 or 32 feet. (A geodesic levelling is not\r\npracticable, owing to the inaccessibility of the locality and the\r\npestiferous atmosphere, which swarms with mosquitoes.) I say with\r\nsurprise, for I hence discovered that the tremendous roar and wild dashing\r\nof the stream arose from the contraction of its bed by numerous rocks and\r\nislands, and the counter-currents produced by the form and position of the\r\nmasses of rock. The truth of my assertion regarding the inconsiderable\r\nheight of the whole fall will be best verified by observing the cataracts,\r\nin descending to the bed of the river, from the village of Maypures,\r\nacross the rocks of Manimi.\r\n\r\nAt this point the beholder enjoys a most striking and wonderful prospect.\r\nA foaming surface, several miles in length, intersected with iron-black\r\nmasses of rock projecting like battlemented ruins from the waters, is seen\r\nat one view. Every islet and every rock is adorned with luxuriant forest\r\ntrees. A perpetual mist hovers over the watery mirror, and the summits of\r\nthe lofty palms pierce through the clouds of vapoury spray. When the rays\r\nof the glowing evening sun are refracted in the humid atmosphere, an\r\nexquisite optical illusion is produced. Coloured bows appear, vanish, and\r\nreappear, while the ethereal picture dances, like an ignis fatuus, with\r\nevery motion of the sportive breeze.\r\n\r\nDuring the long rainy seasons, the falling waters carry down quantities of\r\nvegetable mould, which accumulating, form islands of the naked rocks;\r\nadorning the barren stone with blooming beds of Melastomes and Droseras,\r\nsilver-leaved _Mimosæ_, and a variety of ferns. They recal to the mind of\r\nthe European those groups of vegetation which the inhabitants of the Alps\r\nterm _courtils_, blocks of granite bedecked with flowers which project\r\nsolitarily amid the Glaciers of Savoy.\r\n\r\nIn the blue distance the eye rests on the mountain chain of Cunavami, a\r\nfar-stretching chain of hills which terminates abruptly in a sharply\r\ntruncated cone. We saw this conical hill, called by the Indians\r\nCalitamini, glowing at sunset as if in crimson flames. This appearance\r\ndaily returns. No one has ever been in the immediate neighbourhood of this\r\nmountain. Possibly its dazzling brightness is produced by the reflecting\r\nsurface of decomposing talc, or mica schist.\r\n\r\nDuring the five days that we passed in the neighbourhood of the cataracts,\r\nwe were much struck by the fact that the roar of the rushing torrent was\r\nthree times as great by night as by day. The same phenomenon is observed\r\nin all European waterfalls. To what can we ascribe this effect in a\r\nsolitude where the repose of nature is undisturbed? Probably to ascending\r\ncurrents of warm air, which producing an unequal density of the elastic\r\nmedium, obstruct the propagation of sound by displacing its waves; causes\r\nwhich cease after the nocturnal cooling of the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nThe Indians showed us traces of ruts caused by wheels. They speak with\r\nwonder of the horned cattle, (oxen,) which at the period of the Jesuit\r\nmissions used to draw the trucks, that conveyed the canoes, along the left\r\nshore of the Orinoco, from the mouth of the Cameji to that of the Toparo.\r\nThe canoes at that time were transported without the discharge of their\r\ncargoes, and were not as now injured by being constantly dragged over\r\nsharp-pointed rocks, or stranded.\r\n\r\nThe topographical plan which I have sketched of the locality, shews that a\r\ncanal might be opened between the Cameji and the Toparo. The valley in\r\nwhich these two abundantly watered rivers flow is a gentle level; and the\r\ncanal, of which I suggested a plan to the Governor-General of Venezuela,\r\nwould become a navigable arm of the Orinoco, and supersede the old and\r\ndangerous bed of the river.\r\n\r\nThe Raudal of Atures is exactly similar to that of Maypures, like which it\r\nconsists of a cluster of islands between which the river forces itself a\r\npassage extending from 18,000 to 24,000 feet. Here too a forest of palm\r\ntrees rises from the midst of the foaming surface of the waters. The most\r\ncelebrated ledges of the cataract are situated between the islands of\r\nAvaguri and Javariveni, between Suripamana and Uirapuri.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Bonpland and myself were returning from the banks of the Rio\r\nNegro, we ventured to pass the latter, that is the lower half, of the\r\nRaudal of Atures in our loaded canoe. We several times disembarked to\r\nclimb over rocks, which, like dykes, connected one island with another. At\r\none time the water shoots over these dykes; at another it falls into their\r\ncavities with a deafening hollow sound. In some places considerable\r\nportions of the bed of the river are perfectly dry, in consequence of the\r\nstream having opened for itself a subterranean passage. In this solitude\r\nthe golden-coloured Rock Manakin (_Pipra rupicola_) builds its nest. This\r\nbird, which is as pugnacious as the East India cock, is one of the most\r\nbeautiful birds of the tropics, and is remarkable for its double moveable\r\ncrest of feathers with which its head is decorated.\r\n\r\nIn the Raudal of Canucari the dyke is formed of piled-up granitic\r\nboulders. We crept into the interior of a cavern, whose humid walls were\r\ncovered with confervæ and phosphorescent Byssus. The river rushed over our\r\nheads with a terrible and stunning noise. By accident we had an\r\nopportunity of contemplating this grand scene longer than we desired. The\r\nIndian boatmen had left us in the middle of the cataract, to take the\r\ncanoe round a small island, at the other extremity of which, after a\r\nconsiderable circuit, we were to re-embark. For an hour and a half we\r\nremained exposed to a fearful thunder-storm. Night was approaching, and we\r\nin vain sought shelter in the fissures of the rocks. The little apes which\r\nwe had carried with us for months in wicker cages, attracted by their\r\nplaintive cries large crocodiles, whose size and leaden-grey colour\r\nindicated their great age. I should not have alluded to the appearance of\r\nthese animals in the Orinoco, where they are of such common occurrence,\r\nwere it not that the natives had assured us that no crocodiles had ever\r\nbeen seen among the cataracts; indeed, on the strength of that assertion,\r\nwe had repeatedly ventured to bathe in this portion of the river.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile our anxiety increased every moment, lest, drenched as we were\r\nand deafened by the thundering roar of the falling waters, we should be\r\ncompelled to spend the long tropical night in the midst of the Raudal. At\r\nlength, however, the Indians made their appearance with our canoe. Their\r\ndelay had been occasioned by the inaccessibility of the steps they had to\r\ndescend, owing to the low state of the water; which had obliged them to\r\nseek in the labyrinth of channels a more practicable passage.\r\n\r\nNear the southern entrance of the Raudal of Atures, on the right bank of\r\nthe river, lies the cavern of Ataruipe, so celebrated among the Indians.\r\nThe surrounding scenery has a grand and solemn character, which seems to\r\nmark it as a national burial-place. With difficulty, and not without\r\ndanger of being precipitated into the depths below, we clambered a steep\r\nand perfectly bare granite rock, on whose smooth surface it would be\r\nhardly possible to keep one’s footing were it not for large crystals of\r\nfeldspar, which, defying the action of weather, project an inch or more\r\nfrom the mass.\r\n\r\nOn gaining the summit, a wide prospect of the surrounding country\r\nastonishes the beholder. From the foaming bed of the river rise hills\r\nrichly crowned with woods, while beyond its western bank the eye rests on\r\nthe boundless Savannah of the Meta. On the horizon loom like threatening\r\nclouds the mountains of Uniama. Such is the distant view; but immediately\r\naround all is desolate and contracted. In the deep ravines of the valley\r\nmoves no living thing save where the vulture and the whirring goat-sucker\r\nwing their lonely way, their heavy shadows gleaming fitfully past the\r\nbarren rock.\r\n\r\nThe cauldron-shaped valley is encompassed by mountains, whose rounded\r\nsummits bear huge granite boulders, measuring from 40 to more than 50 feet\r\nin diameter. They appear poised on only a single point of their surface,\r\nas if the slightest shock of the earth would hurl them down.\r\n\r\nThe further side of this rocky valley is thickly wooded. It is in this\r\nshady spot that the cave of the Ataruipe is situated; properly speaking,\r\nhowever, it is not a cave, but a vault formed by a far projecting and\r\noverhanging cliff,—a kind of bay hollowed out by the waters when formerly\r\nat this high level. This spot is the grave of an extinct tribe[63]. We\r\ncounted about six hundred well-preserved skeletons, placed in as many\r\nbaskets, formed of the stalks of palm-leaves. These baskets, called by the\r\nIndians _mapires_, are a kind of square sack varying in size according to\r\nthe age of the deceased. Even new-born children have each their own\r\nmapire. These skeletons are so perfect, that not a rib or a finger is\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\nThe bones are prepared in three different ways: some are bleached, some\r\ndyed red with onoto, the pigment of the _Bixa Orellana_; others like\r\nmummies, are anointed with fragrant resin and wrapped in banana leaves.\r\n\r\nThe Indians assured me that the corpse was buried during several months in\r\na moist earth, which gradually destroyed the flesh; and that after being\r\ndisinterred, any particles of flesh still adhering to the bones were\r\nscraped off with sharp stones. This practice is still continued among many\r\ntribes of Guiana. Besides these baskets or mapires, we saw many urns of\r\nhalf-burnt clay, which appear to contain the bones of whole families. The\r\nlargest of these urns are upwards of three feet in height and nearly six\r\nfeet in length, of an elegant oval form, and greenish colour; with handles\r\nshaped like crocodiles and serpents, and the rims bordered with flowing\r\nscrolls and labyrinthine figures. These ornaments are precisely similar to\r\nthose which cover the walls of the Mexican palace at Mitla. They are found\r\nin every clime and every stage of human culture,—among the Greeks and\r\nRomans, no less than on the shields of Otaheitans, and other South Sea\r\nislanders,—in all regions where a rhythmical repetition of regular forms\r\ndelights the eye. The causes of these resemblances, as I have explained\r\nelsewhere, are rather to be referred to psychical conditions, and to the\r\ninner nature of our mental qualifications, than as affording evidence in\r\nfavour of a common origin and the ancient intercourse of nations.[IA]\r\n\r\nOur interpreters could give us no certain information regarding the age of\r\nthese vessels; but that of the skeletons did not in general appear to\r\nexceed a hundred years. There is a legend amongst the Guareke Indians,\r\nthat the brave Atures, when closely pursued by the cannibal Caribs, took\r\nrefuge on the rocks of the cataracts,—a mournful place of abode, in which\r\nthis oppressed race perished, together with its language![64] In the most\r\ninaccessible portion of the Raudal other graves of the same character are\r\nmet with; indeed it is probable that the last descendants of the Atures\r\ndid not become extinct until a much more recent period. There still lives\r\nand it is a singular fact, an old parrot in Maypures which cannot be\r\nunderstood, because, as the natives assert, it speaks the language of the\r\nAtures!\r\n\r\nWe left the cave at nightfall, after having collected, to the extreme\r\nannoyance of our Indian guides, several skulls and the perfect skeleton of\r\nan aged man. One of these skulls has been delineated by Blumenbach in his\r\nadmirable craniological work;[IB] but the skeleton, together with a large\r\nportion of our natural history collections, especially the entomological,\r\nwas lost by shipwreck off the coast of Africa on the same occasion when\r\nour friend and former travelling companion, the young Franciscan monk,\r\nJuan Gonzalez, lost his life.\r\n\r\nAs if with a presentiment of this painful loss, we turned from the grave\r\nof a departed race with feelings of deep emotion. It was one of those\r\nclear and deliciously cool nights so frequent beneath the tropics. The\r\nmoon stood high in the zenith, encircled by a halo of coloured rings, her\r\nrays gilding the margins of the mist, which in well defined outline\r\nhovered like clouds above the foaming flood. Innumerable insects poured\r\ntheir red phosphorescent light over the herb-covered surface, which glowed\r\nwith living fire, as though the starry canopy of heaven had sunk upon the\r\ngrassy plain. Climbing Bignonia, fragrant Vanillas, and golden-flowered\r\nBanisterias, adorned the entrance of the cave, while the rustling\r\npalm-leaves waved over the resting-place of the dead.\r\n\r\nThus pass away the generations of men!—thus perish the records of the\r\nglory of nations! Yet when every emanation of the human mind has\r\nfaded—when in the storms of time the monuments of man’s creative art are\r\nscattered to the dust—an ever new life springs from the bosom of the\r\nearth. Unceasingly prolific nature unfolds her germs,—regardless though\r\nsinful man, ever at war with himself, tramples beneath his foot the\r\nripening fruit!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ILLUSTRATIONS AND ADDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\np. 154—“_Across that pacific arm of the sea_.”\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic Ocean, between the parallels of 23° south lat. and 70°\r\nnorth lat., has the form of a furrowed longitudinal valley, in which the\r\nadvancing and receding angles are opposite to each other. I first\r\ndeveloped this idea in my work entitled _Essai d’un Tableau Géologique\r\nde l’Amérique méridionale_, which was published in the _Journal de\r\nPhysique_, t. liii. p. 61.[IC] From the Canary Isles, especially from\r\n21° north lat., and 23° west long., to the north-east coast of South\r\nAmerica, the surface of the ocean is so calm, and the waves so gentle,\r\nthat an open boat might navigate it in safety.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\np. 155—“_Fresh springs among the Islands of the Antilles_.”\r\n\r\nOn the southern coast of the island of Cuba, south-west of the harbour\r\nof Batabano, in the Gulf of Xagua, at a distance of eight to twelve\r\nmiles from the shore, springs of fresh water gush from the bed of the\r\nocean, probably from the action of hydrostatic pressure. The jet is\r\npropelled with such force that boats use extreme caution in approaching\r\nthis spot, which is well known for its counter current producing a heavy\r\nswell. Trading vessels sailing along the coast, which do not purpose\r\nputting into port, sometimes visit these springs, in order to provide\r\nthemselves, in the midst of the ocean, with a supply of fresh water. The\r\nfreshness of the water increases with the depth from which it is drawn.\r\nRiver cows (_Trichecus manati_), which do not generally inhabit salt\r\nwater, are frequently killed here. This singular phenomenon (the fresh\r\nsprings), of which no mention had hitherto been made, was most\r\naccurately investigated by my friend, Don Francisco Lemaur, who made a\r\ntrigonometrical survey of the Bahia de Xagua. I did not myself visit\r\nXagua, but remained in the insular group situated further to the south\r\n(the so-called _Jardines del Rey_), to make astronomical determinations\r\nof their latitude and longitude.\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\np. 155—“_Ancient rocky barrier_.”\r\n\r\nColumbus, whose unwearied spirit of observation was directed on every\r\nside, proposes in his letters to the Spanish monarchs, a geognostic\r\nhypothesis regarding the configuration of the larger Antilles. Being\r\nfully impressed with the idea of the strength of the Equinoctial\r\ncurrent, which has often a westerly direction, he ascribes to it the\r\ndisintegration of the group of the smaller Antilles, and the singularly\r\nlengthened configuration of the southern coasts of Porto Rico, Haiti,\r\nCuba, and Jamaica, all of which follow almost exactly the direction of\r\nparallels of latitude. On his third voyage (from the end of May, 1498,\r\nto the end of November, 1500), when, from the Boca del Drago to the\r\nIsland of Margarita, and afterwards from that island to Haiti, he felt\r\nthe whole force of the equinoctial current, “that movement of the waters\r\nwhich accords with the movement of the heavens—_movimiento de los\r\ncielos_,” he says expressly that the violence of the current has torn\r\nthe Island of Trinidad from the mainland. He refers the sovereigns to a\r\nchart which he sends them—a “_pintura de la tierra_,” drawn by himself,\r\nto which frequent reference is made in the celebrated lawsuit against\r\nDon Diego Colon respecting the rights of the first Admiral. “Es la carta\r\nde marear y figura que hizo el Almirante señalando los rumbos y vientos\r\npor los quales vino á Paria, que dicen parte del Asia.”[ID]\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\np. 156—“_Across the snow-crowned Paropanisus_.”\r\n\r\nIn Diodorus’ description of the Paropanisus,[IE] we seem to recognise a\r\ndelineation of the Peruvian chain of the Andes.

The travels of the\r\nbrothers Robert and Richard Schomburgk, so important in reference to all\r\ndepartments of natural science and geography, have established other and\r\nmore interesting facts; but the problem of the situation of the sources\r\nof the Orinoco has been only partially solved by Sir Robert Schomburgk.\r\nM. Bonpland and myself advanced from the west as far as Esmeralda, or\r\nthe confluence of the Orinoco with the Guapo; and I was enabled, by the\r\naid of well-attested information, to describe the upper course of the\r\nOrinoco to above the mouth of the Gehette, and to the small waterfall\r\n(Raudal) de los Guaharibos. From the east Sir Robert Schomburgk,\r\nproceeding from the mountains of the Majonkong Indians, the inhabited\r\nportion of which he estimated by the boiling point of water to be 3517\r\nfeet in height, succeeded in reaching the Orinoco by the Padamo River,\r\nwhich the Majonkongs and Guinaus (Guaynas?) call Paramu.[IF] I had\r\nplaced this confluence of the Padamo with the Orinoco in my Atlas, in 3°\r\n12′ N. lat., and 65° 46′ W. long. but Schomburgk found it by direct\r\nobservation in 2° 53′ lat. and 65° 48′ W. long. The main object of this\r\ntraveller’s journey was not ‘natural history,’ but the solution of the\r\nprize question proposed by the Royal Geographical Society of London, in\r\nNovember, 1834,—on the connection of the coast of British Guiana with\r\nthe easternmost point which I had reached on the Upper Orinoco. After\r\nundergoing many sufferings, this object was thoroughly achieved. Robert\r\nSchomburgk reached Esmeralda, with his instruments, on the 22nd of\r\nFebruary, 1839. His determinations of the latitude and longitude of the\r\nplace agreed more closely with mine than I had anticipated. Let us here\r\nallow the observer to speak for himself:—“Words are inadequate to\r\ndescribe the feelings which overwhelmed me when I sprang on shore. My\r\nobject was attained; my observations, begun on the coast of Guiana, were\r\nbrought into connection with those of Humboldt at Esmeralda, and I\r\nfreely admit that at a time when my physical powers had almost entirely\r\ndeserted me, and when I was surrounded by dangers and difficulties of no\r\nordinary kind, the recognition which I hoped for from him, was the sole\r\ninducement which inspired me with a fixed determination to press forward\r\ntowards the goal which I had now reached. The emaciated figures of my\r\nIndian companions and my faithful guides proclaimed more fully than any\r\nwords could do, what difficulties we had had to surmount, and had\r\nsurmounted.” After citing expressions so gratifying, I must be permitted\r\nto subjoin the opinions I expressed regarding this great undertaking\r\npromoted by the Royal Geographical Society of London, in my Preface to\r\nthe German edition of Robert Schomburgk’s Account of his Travels,\r\npublished in 1841. “Immediately after my return from Mexico, I indicated\r\nthe direction and the routes by which the unknown portion of the South\r\nAmerican Continent between the sources of the Orinoco, the mountain\r\nchain of Pacaraima, and the sea-shore near Essequibo, might be explored.\r\nThese wishes, so strongly expressed in the personal narrative of my\r\njourney, have at length, after the lapse of nearly half a century, been\r\nfor the most part fulfilled. I rejoice that I have been spared to see so\r\nimportant an enlargement of our geographical knowledge; I rejoice too in\r\nseeing a courageous and well-conducted enterprise, requiring the most\r\ndevoted perseverance, executed by a young man, to whom I feel bound no\r\nless by the ties of similarity of pursuits than those of country. These\r\ncircumstances were alone able to overcome the aversion and\r\ndisinclination which I entertain, perhaps unjustly, for introductory\r\nprefaces by a different hand than that of the author himself. But I\r\ncould not resist the impulse of expressing thus publicly my sincere\r\nesteem for the accomplished traveller who, led on by the meritorious\r\nidea of penetrating from east to west, from the Valley of the Essequibo\r\nto Esmeralda, has succeeded, after five years of efforts and of\r\nsufferings (the extent of which I well appreciate from my own\r\nexperience), in attaining the object of his ambition. Courage for the\r\nsudden accomplishment of a hazardous undertaking is easier to find, and\r\nimplies less inward strength, than the resolution to endure with\r\nresignation long-continued physical sufferings, excited by absorbing\r\nmental interest; and still to press forward, undismayed by the certainty\r\nof having to retrace his steps under equally great privations and with\r\nenfeebled powers. Serenity of mind, which is almost the first requisite\r\nfor an enterprise in inhospitable regions, a passionate love for any\r\ndepartment of scientific labour (be it natural history, astronomy,\r\nhypsometrics, or magnetism), a pure feeling for the enjoyment which\r\nnature is capable of imparting, are elements which, when they combine\r\ntogether in one individual, ensure valuable results from a great and\r\nimportant journey.”\r\n\r\nI will preface my consideration of the question of the sources of the\r\nOrinoco with my own conjectures in relation to the subject. The perilous\r\nroute travelled in 1739 by the surgeon Nicolas Hortsmann, of Hildesheim;\r\nin 1775 by the Spaniard Don Antonio Santos, and his friend Nicolas\r\nRodriguez; in 1793 by the Lieutenant-Colonel of the 1st Regiment of the\r\nLine of Para, Don Francisco José Rodriguez Barata; and (according to\r\nmanuscript maps, for which I am indebted to the former Portuguese\r\nAmbassador in Paris, Chevalier de Brito) by several English and Dutch\r\nsettlers, who in 1811 travelled from Surinam to Para by the portage of\r\nthe Rupunuri and by the Rio Branco;—divides the _terra incognita_ of the\r\nParime into two unequal parts, and serves to mark the position of a very\r\nimportant point in the geography of those regions—viz., the sources of\r\nthe Orinoco, which it is no longer possible to remove to an indefinite\r\ndistance towards the east, without intersecting the bed of the Rio\r\nBranco, which flows from north to south through the fluvial district of\r\nthe Upper Orinoco; while this portion of the great river itself pursues\r\nfor the most part a direction from east to west. The Brazilians, since\r\nthe beginning of the present century, have from political motives\r\nmanifested a vivid interest in the extensive plains east of the Rio\r\nBranco.[IG] Owing to the position of Santa Rosa on the Uraricapara,\r\nwhose course appears to have been pretty accurately determined by\r\nPortuguese engineers, the sources of the Orinoco cannot be situated east\r\nof the meridian of 63° 8′ west long. This is the eastern limit beyond\r\nwhich they cannot be placed, and taking into consideration the state of\r\nthe river at the Raudal de los Guaharibos (above Caño Chiguire, in the\r\ncountry of the strikingly fair-skinned Guaycas Indians, and 52′ east of\r\nthe great Cerro Duida), it appears to me probable that the Orinoco in\r\nits upper part does not extend, at the utmost, beyond the meridian of\r\n64° 8′ west long. This point is, according to my combinations, 4° 12′\r\nwest of the little lake of Amucu, which was reached by Sir Robert\r\nSchomburgk.\r\n\r\nI will now detail the conjectures of that traveller, after having first\r\ngiven my own earlier ones. According to him the course of the Upper\r\nOrinoco, to the east of Esmeralda, is directed from south-east to\r\nnorth-west; my estimations of latitude for the mouths of the Padamo and\r\nthe Gehette appear to be respectively 19′ and 36′ too small. Schomburgk\r\nconjectures that the sources of the Orinoco are situated in lat. 2° 30′,\r\nand the fine “Map of Guayana, to illustrate the route of R. H.\r\nSchomburgk,” which accompanies the splendid English work entitled _Views\r\nin the Interior of Guiana_, places its geographical sources in 64° 56′\r\nwest long., _i.e._, 1° 6′ west of Esmeralda, and only 48′ of longitude\r\nnearer to the Atlantic than I had determined the position of this point.\r\nAstronomical combinations led Schomburgk to place the mountain of\r\nMaravaca, which is about ten thousand feet high, in 3° 41′ lat. and 65°\r\n48′ west long. The Orinoco was scarcely three hundred yards wide near\r\nthe mouth of the Padamo or Paramu, and more to the west, where it\r\nexpands to a width of from four to six hundred yards, it was so shallow,\r\nand so full of sandbanks, that the expedition was obliged to dig\r\nchannels, as the river bed was only fifteen inches deep. Fresh-water\r\ndolphins were still to be seen in great numbers everywhere—a phenomenon\r\nwhich the zoologists of the eighteenth century would not have expected\r\nto find in the Orinoco and the Ganges.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\np. 158—“_The most luxurious product of a tropical climate_.”\r\n\r\nThe _Bertholletia excelsa_ (Juvia), of the family of Myrtaceæ (and\r\nplaced in Richard Schomburgk’s proposed division of Lecythideæ), was\r\nfirst described in _Plantes Equinoxiales_, t. i. 1808, p. 122, tab. 36.\r\nThis colossal and magnificent tree offers, in the perfect development of\r\nits cocoa-like, round, close-grained, woody fruit, inclosing the\r\nthree-cornered and also woody seed-vessels, the most remarkable example\r\nof luxuriant organic development. The Bertholletia grows in the forests\r\nof the Upper Orinoco, between the Padamo and the Ocamu, in the vicinity\r\nof the mountain of Mapaya, as well as between the rivers Amaguaca and\r\nGehette.[IH]\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\np. 158—“_Grass stalks, whose joints measure upwards of eighteen feet\r\nfrom knot to knot_.”\r\n\r\nRobert Schomburgk, when visiting the small mountainous country of the\r\nMajonkongs, on his route to Esmeralda, was fortunate enough to determine\r\nthe species of Arundinaria, which furnishes the material for these\r\nblowing-tubes. He says of this plant: “It grows in large tufts, like the\r\nbambusa; the first joint rises, in the old cane, without a knot, to a\r\nheight of from 16 to 17 feet before it begins to bear leaves. The entire\r\nheight of the Arundinaria, growing at the foot of the great\r\nmountain-cluster of Maravaca, is from 30 to 40 feet, with a thickness of\r\nscarcely half an inch in diameter. The top is always inclined; and this\r\nspecies of grass is peculiar to the sandstone mountains between the\r\nVentuari, the Paramu (Padamo), and the Mavaca. The Indian name is\r\nCurata, and, therefore, from the excellence of these celebrated long\r\nblowing-tubes, the Majonkongs and Guinaus of these districts have\r\nacquired the name of the Curata nation.”[II]\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\np. 159—“_Fabulous origin of the Orinoco from a lake_.”\r\n\r\nThe lakes of these regions (some of which are wholly imaginary, while\r\nthe real size of others has been much exaggerated by theoretical\r\ngeographers) may be divided into two groups. The first of these groups\r\ncomprise those situate between Esmeralda (the most easterly mission on\r\nthe Upper Orinoco), and the Rio Branco; to the second, belong the lakes\r\npresumed to exist in the district between the Rio Branco and French,\r\nDutch, and British Guiana. This general view, of which travellers should\r\nnever lose sight, proves that the question of whether there is another\r\nLake Parime eastward of the Rio Branco, besides the Lake Amucu, seen by\r\nHortsmann, Santos, Colonel Barata, and Schomburgk, has nothing whatever\r\nto do with the problem of the sources of the Orinoco. As the name of my\r\ndistinguished friend the former Director of the Hydrographic Office at\r\nMadrid, Don Felipe Bauza, is of great weight in questions of geography,\r\nthe impartiality which ought to influence every scientific investigation\r\nmakes it incumbent on me to mention that this learned man was inclined\r\nto the view that there must be lakes west of the Rio Branco, at no great\r\ndistance from the sources of the Orinoco. He wrote to me from London\r\nshortly before his death, “I wish you were here that I might converse\r\nwith you respecting the geography of the Upper Orinoco, which has\r\noccupied you so much. I have been fortunate enough to rescue from entire\r\ndestruction the papers of the General of Marine, Don José Solano, father\r\nof the Solano who perished in so melancholy a manner at Cadiz. These\r\ndocuments relate to the settlement of the boundary line between the\r\nSpaniards and Portuguese, with which Solano had been charged since 1754,\r\nin conjunction with the Escadre Chef Yturriaga and Don Vicente Doz. In\r\nall these plans and sketches I find a Laguna Parime sometimes as a\r\nsource of the Orinoco, and sometimes as wholly detached from it. Are we\r\nthen to assume that there is another lake further eastward to the\r\nnorth-east of Esmeralda?”\r\n\r\nLöffling, the celebrated pupil of Linnæus, accompanied the last-named\r\nexpedition to Cumana in the capacity of botanist. He died on the 22nd of\r\nFebruary, 1756, at the mission of Santa Eulalia de Murucuri (somewhat to\r\nthe south of the confluence of the Orinoco and Caroni), after traversing\r\nthe missions on the Piritu and Caroni. The documents of which Bauza\r\nspeaks are the same as those on which the great map of De la Cruz\r\nOlmedilla is based. They have served as the foundation of all the maps\r\nof South America, which appeared in England, France, and Germany, before\r\nthe end of the last century; and have also served for the two maps\r\nexecuted in 1756 by Father Caulin, the historiographer of Solano’s\r\nexpedition, and by M. de Surville, Keeper of the Archives in the\r\nSecretary of State’s Office at Madrid, who was but an unskilful\r\ncompiler. The contradictions abounding in these maps show the little\r\nreliance that can be placed on the results of this expedition. Nay more,\r\nFather Caulin, above referred to, acutely details the circumstances\r\nwhich gave rise to this fable of the lake of Parime; and the map of\r\nSurville, which accompanies his work, not only restores this lake, under\r\nthe name of the White Lake, and the Mar Dorado, but indicates another\r\nsmaller one, from which flow partly by means of collateral branches, the\r\nOrinoco, Siapa, and Ocamo. I was able to convince myself on the spot of\r\nthe following facts well known in the missions; that Don José Solano did\r\nnot do more than cross the cataracts of Atures and Maypures; that he did\r\nnot reach the confluence of the Guaviare and the Orinoco in 4° 3′ north\r\nlat., and 68° 9′ west long.; and that the astronomical instruments of\r\nthe boundary expedition were neither carried to the isthmus of the\r\nPimichin and the Rio Negro, nor to the Cassiquiare; and even on the\r\nUpper Orinoco, not beyond the mouth of the Atabapo. This vast extent of\r\nterritory was not made the scene of any accurate observations before my\r\njourney, and has subsequently to Solano’s expedition been traversed only\r\nby some few soldiers who had been sent on exploring expeditions; while\r\nDon Apolinario de Fuente, whose journal I obtained from the archives of\r\nthe province of Quixos, has gathered without discrimination everything\r\nfrom the fallacious narratives of the Indians that could flatter the\r\ncredulity of the Governor Centurion. No member of the expedition had\r\nseen a lake, and Don Apolinario was unable to advance beyond the Cerro\r\nYumarique and Gehette.\r\n\r\nAlthough a line of separation, formed by the basin of the Rio Branco, is\r\nnow established throughout the whole extent of the country, to which we\r\nare desirous of directing the inquiring zeal of travellers, it must yet\r\nbe admitted, that our geographical knowledge of the district west of\r\nthis valley between 62° and 66° long., has made no advance whatever for\r\nat least a century. The repeated attempts made by the Government of\r\nSpanish Guiana since the expeditions of Iturria and Solano, to reach and\r\nto pass over the Pacaraima Mountains, have been attended by very\r\nunimportant results. When the Spaniards, in proceeding to the missions\r\nof the Catalonian capuchins of Barceloneta, at the confluence of the\r\nCaroni and the Rio Paragua, ascended the last-named river southward to\r\nits junction with the Paraguamusi, they founded at this point the\r\nmission of Guirion, which, at first, bore the pompous appellation of\r\nCiudad de Guirion. I place it in about 4° 30′ north latitude. From\r\nthence the Governor Centurion, in consequence of the exaggerated\r\naccounts given by two Indian chiefs, Paranacare and Arimuicapi,\r\nrespecting the powerful tribe of the Ipurucotos, was excited to search\r\nfor ‘El Dorado,’ and in carrying what were then called spiritual\r\nconquests still further, founded, beyond the Pacaraima Mountains, the\r\ntwo villages of Santa Rosa and San Bautista de Caudacacla. The former\r\nwas situate on the upper eastern bank of the Uraricapara, a tributary of\r\nthe Uraricuera, which I find in the journal of Rodriguez under the name\r\nof the Rio Curaricara; the latter, at from 24 to 28 miles further\r\neast-south-east. The astronomo-geographer of the Portuguese Boundary\r\nCommission, Captain Don Antonio Pires de Sylva Pontes Leme, and the\r\nCaptain of Engineers, Don Ricardo Franco d’Almeida de Serra, who between\r\n1787 and 1804, surveyed with the greatest care the whole course of the\r\nRio Branco and its upper tributaries, call the most western part of the\r\nUraricapara, “The Valley of Inundation.” They place the Spanish mission\r\nof Santa Rosa in 3° 46′ north lat., and mark the route that leads from\r\nthence northward across the mountain chain to the Caño Anocapra, a\r\nbranch of the Paraguamusi, which forms a connecting passage between the\r\nbasin of the Rio Branco and that of the Caroni. Two maps of these\r\nPortuguese officers, embracing all the details of the trigonometrical\r\nsurvey of the bends of the Rio Branco, the Uraricuera, the Tacutu, and\r\nthe Mahu, were most kindly communicated to Colonel Lapie and myself by\r\nthe Count of Linhares. These valuable unpublished documents, of which I\r\nhave availed myself, are still in the hands of the learned geographer,\r\nwho long since began to have them engraved at his own expense. The\r\nPortuguese sometimes call the whole of the Rio Branco by the name of Rio\r\nParime, and sometimes limit this appellation to one branch only, the\r\nUraricuera, somewhat below the Caño Mayari and above the old mission of\r\nSan Antonio. As the words _Paragua_ and _Parime_ alike imply water,\r\ngreat water, lake, and sea, we cannot wonder at finding them so often\r\nrepeated among tribes living at great distances from each other; as, for\r\ninstance, by the Omaguas on the Upper Marañon, by the Western Guaranis,\r\nand by the Caribs. In all parts of the world, as I have already\r\nremarked, large rivers are called by those who live on their banks “the\r\nRiver,” without any specific denomination. Paragua, the name of a branch\r\nof the Caroni, is also the term applied by the natives to the Upper\r\nOrinoco. The name Orinucu is Tamanakish; and Diego de Ordaz first heard\r\nit used in the year 1531, when he ascended to the mouth of the Meta.\r\nBesides the Valley of Inundation above mentioned we find other large\r\npieces of water between the Rio Xumuru and the Parime. One of these bays\r\nis a branch of the Tacutu, and the other of the Uraricuera. Even at the\r\nbase of the Pacaraima Mountains the rivers are subject to great\r\nperiodical overflowings; and the Lake Amucu, of which we shall\r\nsubsequently speak more fully, exhibits exactly the same character at\r\nthe commencement of the plains. The Spanish missions, Santa Rosa and San\r\nBautista de Caudacacla, or Cayacaya, founded in the years 1770 and 1773,\r\nby the Governor Don Manuel Centurion, were destroy ed before the close\r\nof the last century; and since that time, no new attempt has been made\r\nto advance from the basin of the Caroni to the southern declivity of the\r\nPacaraima Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe territory east of the valley of the Rio Branco has of late years\r\nbeen made the subject of several successful explorations. Mr. Hillhouse\r\nnavigated the Massaruni as far as the Bay of Caranang, whence, as he\r\nsays, a path would lead the traveller, in two days, to the source of the\r\nMassaruni; and, in three days, to the tributaries of the Rio Branco.\r\nWith respect to the windings of the great river Massaruni, described by\r\nMr. Hillhouse, he himself observes, in a letter addressed to me from\r\nDemerara, 1st January, 1831, that “the Massaruni, reckoning from its\r\nsources, flows first to the west, then for one degree of latitude to the\r\nnorth; afterwards nearly 200 miles eastward; and, finally, to the north\r\nand north-north-east till it merges in the Essequibo.” As Mr. Hillhouse\r\nwas unable to reach the southern declivity of the Pacaraima chain, he\r\nwas not acquainted with the Amucu Lake; and he says himself, in his\r\nprinted report, that “from the accounts given him by the Accaouais, who\r\nare continually traversing the country between the shore and the Amazon\r\nRiver, he is convinced there is no lake in this district.” This\r\nassertion occasioned me some surprise, as it was directly opposed to the\r\nviews I had previously formed regarding the Lake Amucu, from which flows\r\nthe Caño Pirara, according to the accounts given by the travellers\r\nHortsmann, Santos, and Rodriguez (and which had inspired me with the\r\nmore confidence, because they entirely coincide with the recent\r\nPortuguese manuscript charts). Finally, after five years of expectation,\r\nSchomburgk’s journey has removed all farther doubt.\r\n\r\n“It is difficult to believe,” says Mr. Hillhouse, in his interesting\r\nmemoir on the Massaruni, “that the tradition of a large inland sea is\r\nwholly unfounded. According to my views, the following circumstance may\r\nhave given rise to the belief in the existence of the fabulous lake of\r\nthe Parime. At some distance from the rocky fall of Teboco the waters of\r\nthe Massaruni present to the eye as little motion as the calm surface of\r\na lake. If at a more or less remote period the horizontal granitic\r\nstrata of Teboco had been totally compact and without fissures, the\r\nwaters must have been at least 50 feet above their present level, and\r\nthere would have been formed an immense lake 10 or 12 miles in width,\r\nand 1500 or 2000 miles in length.”[IJ] The extent of this supposed\r\ninundation is not the only reason which prevents me from acceding to\r\nthis explanation; for I have seen plains (Llanos), where, during the\r\nrainy season, the overflowing of the tributaries of the Orinoco annually\r\ncovered a surface of 6400 square miles. The labyrinth of ramifications\r\nbetween the Apure, Arauca, Capanaparo, and Sinaruco (see maps 17 and 18\r\nof my Physical Atlas), is then wholly lost sight of; the configuration\r\nof the river beds can no longer be traced, and the whole appears like\r\none vast lake. But the locality of the fabulous Dorado, and of the Lake\r\nParime, belongs historically to quite a different part of Guiana,\r\nnamely, that lying south of the Pacaraima mountains. This myth of the\r\nWhite Sea and of the Dorado of the Parime, has arisen, as I endeavoured\r\nthirty years ago to show in another work, from the appearance of the\r\nmicaceous rocks of the Ucucuamo, the name _Rio Parime_ (Rio Branco), the\r\ninundations of the tributaries; and especially from the existence of the\r\nlake _Amucu_, which is in the neighbourhood of the Rio Rupunuwini\r\n(Rupunuri), and is connected by means of the Pirara with the Rio Parime.\r\n\r\nI have had much pleasure in finding that the travels of Sir Robert\r\nSchomburgk have fully corroborated these early views. The section of his\r\nmap which gives the course of the Essequibo and of the Rupunuri is quite\r\nnew, and of great importance in a geographical point of view. It places\r\nthe Pacaraima chain between 3° 52′and 4° north lat., while I had given\r\nits mean direction from 4° to 4° 10′. The chain reaches the confluence\r\nof the Essequibo and Rupunuri in 3° 57′ north lat., and 58° 1′ west\r\nlongitude; I had placed it half a degree too far to the north.\r\nSchomburgk calls the last-named river Rupununi, according to the\r\npronunciation of the Macusis; and gives as the synonymes Rupunuri,\r\nRupunuwini and Opununy, which have arisen from the difficulty the Carib\r\ntribes of these districts find in pronouncing the letter “r.” The\r\nposition of the lake Amucu and its relations to the Mahu (Maou) and\r\nTacutu (Tacoto) correspond perfectly with my map of Colombia drawn in\r\n1825. We agree equally well regarding the latitude of the lake of Amucu,\r\nfor while he places it in 3° 33′, I considered it to be in 3° 35′; the\r\nCaño Pirara (Pirarara) which connects the Amucu with the Rio Branco,\r\nflows from it towards the north, and not to the west as I had marked it.\r\nThe Sibarana of my map, the sources of which Hortsmann placed to the\r\nnorth of the Cerro Ucucuamo near a fine mine of rock crystal, is the\r\nSiparuni of Schomburgk’s map. His Waa-Ekuru is the Tavaricaru of the\r\nPortuguese geographer Pontes Leme, and is the branch of the Rupunuri\r\nwhich lies the nearest to the lake of Amucu.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks from the report of Sir Robert Schomburgk throw\r\nsome light on the subject in question. “The lake of Amucu,” says this\r\ntraveller, “is without doubt the nucleus of the Lake of Parime and of\r\nthe supposed White Sea. In December and January, when we visited it, it\r\nwas scarcely a mile in length, and was half covered with reeds.” The\r\nsame observation occurs on D’Anville’s map of 1748. “The Pirara flows\r\nfrom the lake to the W.N.W. of the Indian village of Pirara and falls\r\ninto the Maou or Mahu. The last-named river rises, according to the\r\ninformation given me, north of the ridge of the Pacaraima mountains,\r\nwhich in their eastern portion do not attain a greater elevation than\r\nabout 1600 feet. The sources of the river are on a plateau, from whence\r\nit is precipitated in a beautiful waterfall, known as the Corona. We\r\nwere on the point of visiting this fall, when on the third day of our\r\nexcursion to the mountains, the indisposition of one of my companions\r\ncompelled me to return to the station at the lake Amucu. The Mahu has\r\nblack coffee-coloured water, and its current is more impetuous than that\r\nof the Rupunuri. In the mountains through which it pursues its course it\r\nis about 60 yards in breadth. Its environs are here extremely\r\npicturesque. This valley as well as the bank of the Buroburo, which\r\nflows into the Siparuni, are inhabited by the Macusis. In April the\r\nwhole Savannahs are overflowed, and then present the peculiar phenomenon\r\nof the waters belonging to two different river basins commingling\r\ntogether. It is probable that the vast extent of this temporary\r\ninundation may have given rise to the fable of the lake of Parime.\r\nDuring the rainy season a water communication is formed in the interior\r\nof the country between the Essequibo, the Rio Branco, and the Gran Para.\r\nSome groups of trees, rising like Oases on the sand-hills of the\r\nSavannahs, present, at the time of the inundation, the appearance of\r\nislands scattered over a lake; and these are without doubt the Ipomucena\r\nislands of Don Antonio Santos.”\r\n\r\nIn D’Anville’s manuscripts, which his heirs kindly allowed me to\r\nexamine, I find that Hortsmann of Hildesheim, who described these\r\ndistricts with great care, saw a second Alpine lake, which he places two\r\nday’s journey above the confluence of the Mahu with the Rio Parime\r\n(Tacutu?). It is a black water lake, situated on the summit of a\r\nmountain. He explicitly distinguishes it from the lake of Amucu, which\r\nhe describes as “covered with rushes.” The descriptions given by\r\nHortsmann and Santos coincide with the Portuguese manuscript maps of the\r\nMarine Bureau at Rio Janeiro, in not indicating the existence of an\r\nuninterrupted connection between the Rupunuri and the lake of Amucu. In\r\nD’Anville’s maps of South America, the rivers are better drawn in the\r\nfirst edition published in 1748, than in the more extensively circulated\r\none of 1760. Schomburgk’s travels fully confirm the independence of the\r\nbasin of the Rupunuri and Essequibo; but he draws attention to the fact\r\nthat, during the rainy season, the Rio Waa-Ekuru, a tributary of the\r\nRupunuri, is in connection with the Caño Pirara. Such is the condition\r\nof these river-channels, which are still but little developed, and\r\nalmost entirely without separating ridges.\r\n\r\nThe Rupunuri and the village of Anai, 3° 56′ north latitude, 58° 34′\r\nwest longitude, are at present recognised as the political boundaries\r\nbetween the British and Brazilian domains in these desert regions. Sir\r\nRobert Schomburgk was compelled by severe illness to make a protracted\r\nstay at Anai. He bases his chronometrical determinations of the position\r\nof the lake of Amucu on the mean of many lunar distances, east and west,\r\nwhich he measured during his sojourn at Anai. His determinations of\r\nlongitude for these points of the Parime are in general one degree more\r\neast than those in my map of Colombia. While I am far from calling in\r\nquestion the result of these lunar observations taken at Anai, I may be\r\nallowed to observe that the calculation of these distances is of\r\nimportance, when it is desired to carry the comparison from the lake of\r\nAmucu to Esmeralda, which I found in 66° 19′ west longitude.\r\n\r\nThus then we see the great _Mar de la Parima_, (which it was so\r\ndifficult to remove from our maps, that even after my return from\r\nAmerica it was still supposed to be 160 miles in length,) reduced by\r\nrecent investigations to the lake of Amucu, measuring only two or three\r\nmiles in circumference. The illusions entertained for nearly two hundred\r\nyears, and which in the last Spanish expedition, in 1775, for the\r\ndiscovery of El Dorado, cost several hundred lives, have finally\r\nterminated by enriching geography with some few results. In the year\r\n1512 thousands of soldiers perished in the expedition, undertaken by\r\nPonce de Leon, to discover the “Fountain of Youth,” on one of the Bahama\r\nIslands, called Binimi, which is hardly to be found on any of our maps.\r\nThis expedition led to the conquest of Florida, and to the knowledge of\r\nthe great oceanic current, or gulf-stream, which flows through the\r\nStraights of Bahama. The thirst after gold, and the desire of\r\nrejuvenescence—the _Dorado_ and the _Fountain of Youth_—stimulated, to\r\nan almost equal extent, the passions of mankind.\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\np. 161—“_The Piriguao, one of the noblest forms of the Palm_.”\r\n\r\nCompare Humboldt, Bonpland, and Kunth, _Nova Genera Plantarum_, and\r\n_Plant. æquinoct._, t. i. p. 315.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\np. 171—“_The grave of an extinct race_.”\r\n\r\nDuring my stay in the forests of the Orinoco, researches were being\r\nmade, by royal command, in reference to these bone-caves. The missionary\r\nof the cataracts had been falsely accused of having discovered in these\r\ncaves treasures which the Jesuits had concealed there prior to their\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\np. 172—“_When his language perished with him_.”\r\n\r\nThe parrot of the Atures has been made the subject of a charming poem by\r\nmy friend Professor Ernst Curtius, the tutor of the promising young\r\nPrince Friedrick Wilhelm of Prussia. The author will forgive me for\r\nclosing the present section of the “Views of Nature” with this poem,\r\nwhich was not designed for publication, and was communicated to me by\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE PARROT OF ATURES.\r\n\r\n               Where, through deserts wild and dreary,\r\n                 Orinoco dashes on,\r\n               Sits a Parrot old and weary,\r\n                 Like a sculptur’d thing of stone.\r\n\r\n               Through its rocky barriers flowing,\r\n                 Onward rolls the foaming stream;\r\n               Waving palms on high are glowing\r\n                 In the sun’s meridian beam.\r\n\r\n               Ceaselessly the waves are heaving,\r\n                 Sparkling up in antic play;\r\n               While the sunny rays are weaving\r\n                 Rainbows in the feathery spray.\r\n\r\n               Where yon billows wild are breaking,\r\n                 Sleeps a tribe for evermore,\r\n               Who, their native land forsaking,\r\n                 Refuge sought on this lone shore.\r\n\r\n               As they lived, free, dauntless ever,\r\n                 So the brave Aturians died;\r\n               And the green banks of the river\r\n                 All their mortal relics hide.\r\n\r\n               Yet the Parrot, ne’er forgetting\r\n                 Those who loved him, mourns them still;\r\n               On the stone his sharp beak whetting,\r\n                 While the air his wailings fill.\r\n\r\n               Where are now the youths who bred him,\r\n                 To pronounce their mother tongue,—\r\n               Where the gentle maids who fed him,\r\n                 And who built his nest when young?\r\n\r\n                  All, alas! are lifeless lying,\r\n                    Stretch’d upon their grassy bed;\r\n                  Nor can all his mournful crying,\r\n                    E’er awake the slumbering dead.\r\n\r\n                  Still he calls with voice imploring,\r\n                    To a world that heeds him not;\r\n                  Nought replies but waters roaring—\r\n                    No kind soul bewails his lot.\r\n\r\n                  Swift the savage turns his rudder,\r\n                    When his eyes the bird behold;\r\n                  None e’er saw without a shudder\r\n                    That Aturian Parrot old!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE NOCTURNAL LIFE OF ANIMALS\r\n                                 IN THE\r\n                            PRIMEVAL FOREST.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the faculty of appreciating nature, in different races of man, and if\r\nthe character of the countries they now inhabit, or have traversed in\r\ntheir earlier migrations, have more or less enriched the respective\r\nlanguages by appropriate terms, expressive of the forms of mountains, the\r\nstate of vegetation, the appearances of the atmosphere, and the contour\r\nand grouping of the clouds, it must be admitted that by long use and\r\nliterary caprice many of these designations have been diverted from the\r\nsense they originally bore. Words have gradually been regarded as\r\nsynonymous, which ought to have remained distinct; and languages have thus\r\nlost a portion of the expressiveness and force which might else have\r\nimparted a physiognomical character to descriptions of natural scenery. As\r\nan evidence of the extent to which a communion with nature, and the\r\nrequirements of a laborious nomadic life, may enrich language, I would\r\nrecall the abundance of characteristic denominations employed in Arabic\r\nand Persian, to distinguish plains, steppes, and deserts[65], according as\r\nthey are entirely bare, covered with sand, or intersected by tabular\r\nmasses of rock; or as they are diversified by spots of pasture land and\r\nextended tracts of social plants. The old Castilian dialects are no less\r\nremarkable[66] for the copiousness of their terms descriptive of the\r\nphysiognomy of mountains, especially in reference to those features which\r\nrecur in all regions of the earth, and which proclaim afar off the nature\r\nof the rock. As the declivities of the Andes and the mountainous parts of\r\nthe Canaries, the Antilles, and the Philippines, are all inhabited by\r\nraces of Spanish descent; and as the nature of the soil has there\r\ninfluenced the mode of life of the inhabitants to a greater degree than in\r\nother parts of the world, excepting perhaps in the Himalaya and the\r\nThibetian Highlands; so also the designations expressive of the forms of\r\nmountains in trachytic, basaltic, and porphyritic districts, as well as in\r\nschistose, calcareous, and sandstone formations, have been happily\r\npreserved in daily use. Under such circumstances, newly formed words\r\nbecome incorporated with the common stock. Speech acquires life from\r\neverything which bears the true impress of nature, whether it be by the\r\ndefinition of sensuous impressions received from the external world, or by\r\nthe expression of thoughts and feelings that emanate from our inner being.\r\n\r\nIn descriptions of natural phenomena, as well as in the choice of the\r\nexpressions employed, this truth to nature should be especially kept in\r\nview. The object will be the best attained by simplicity in the narration\r\nof whatever we have ourselves observed and experienced, and by closely\r\nexamining the locality with which the subject-matter is connected.\r\nGeneralisation of physical views, and the enumeration of results, belong\r\nprincipally to the study of the Cosmos, which, indeed, must still be\r\nregarded as an inductive science; but the vivid delineation of organic\r\nforms (animals and plants,) in their picturesque and local relations to\r\nthe multiform surface of the earth, although limited to a small section of\r\nterrestrial life, still affords materials for this study. It acts as a\r\nstimulus to the mind wherever it is capable of appreciating the great\r\nphenomena of nature in an æsthetic point of view.\r\n\r\nTo these phenomena belongs especially the boundless forest district which,\r\nin the torrid zone of South America, connects the river basins of the\r\nOrinoco and the Amazon. This region deserves, in the strictest sense of\r\nthe word, to be called a _primeval_ forest—a term that has, in recent\r\ntimes, been so frequently misapplied. Primeval (or primitive), as applied\r\nto a forest, a nation, or a period of time, is a word of rather indefinite\r\nsignification, and generally but of relative import. If every wild forest,\r\ndensely covered with trees, on which man has never laid his destroying\r\nhand, is to be regarded as a primitive forest, then the phenomenon is\r\ncommon to many parts both of the temperate and the frigid zones; if,\r\nhowever, this character consists in impenetrability, through which it is\r\nimpossible to clear with the axe, between trees measuring from 8 to 12\r\nfeet in diameter, a path of any length, primitive forests belong\r\nexclusively to tropical regions. This impenetrability is by no means, as\r\nis often erroneously supposed in Europe, always occasioned by the\r\ninterlaced climbing “lianes,” or creeping plants, for these often\r\nconstitute but a very small portion of the underwood. The chief obstacles\r\nare the shrub-like plants which fill up every space between the trees, in\r\na zone where all vegetable forms have a tendency to become arborescent. If\r\ntravellers, the moment they set foot in a tropical region, and even while\r\non islands, in the vicinity of the sea-coast, imagine that they are within\r\nthe precincts of a primeval forest, the misconception must be ascribed to\r\ntheir ardent desire of realizing a long-cherished wish. Every tropical\r\nforest is not _primeval_ forest. I have scarcely ever used the latter term\r\nin the narrative of my travels; although, I believe, that of all\r\ninvestigators of nature now living, Bonpland, Martius, Pöppig, Robert and\r\nRichard Schomburgk, and myself, have spent the longest period of time in\r\nprimeval forests in the interior of a great continent.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the striking richness of the Spanish language in\r\ndesignations, (descriptive of natural objects, of which I have already\r\nspoken), yet one and the same word _monte_ is employed for a mountain and\r\na forest, for _cerro_ (_montaña_), and for _selva_. In a work on the true\r\nbreadth and the greatest extension of the chain of the Andes towards the\r\neast, I have shown how this twofold signification of the word _monte_ has\r\nled to the error, in a fine and extensively circulated English map of\r\nSouth America, of marking ranges of high mountains in districts occupied\r\nonly by plains. Where the Spanish map of La Cruz Olmedilla, which formed\r\nthe basis of so many others, indicated Cacao Woods, _Montes de Cacao_[67],\r\nCordilleras were supposed to exist, although the Cacao-tree affects only\r\nthe hottest of the low lands.\r\n\r\nIf we comprehend, in one general view, the woody region which embraces the\r\nwhole of South America, between the grassy plains of Venezuela (_los\r\nLlanos de Caracas_) and the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, lying between 8° north\r\nand 19° south latitude, we perceive that this connected _Hylæa_ of the\r\ntropical zone is unequalled in extent by any other on the surface of the\r\nearth. Its area is about twelve times that of Germany. Traversed in all\r\ndirections by rivers, some of whose direct and indirect tributary streams\r\n(as well those of the second as of the first order) surpass the Danube and\r\nRhine in the abundance of their waters, it owes the wonderful luxuriance\r\nof its vegetation to the twofold influence of great humidity and high\r\ntemperature. In the temperate zone, particularly in Europe and Northern\r\nAsia, forests may be named from particular genera of trees which grow\r\ntogether as social plants (_plantæ sociales_), and form separate woods. In\r\nthe Oak, Pine, and Birch forests of the northern regions, and in the\r\nLinden or Lime Woods of the eastern, there usually predominates only one\r\nspecies of Amentaceæ, Coniferæ or Tiliaceæ; while sometimes a single\r\nspecies of Piniferæ is intermixed with trees of deciduous foliage. Such\r\nuniformity of association is unknown in tropical forests. The excessive\r\nvariety of their rich sylvan flora renders it vain to ask, of what do the\r\nprimeval forests consist. Numberless families of plants are here crowded\r\ntogether; and even in small spaces, plants of the same species are rarely\r\nassociated. Every day, and with every change of place, new forms present\r\nthemselves to the traveller’s attention; often flowers, beyond his reach,\r\nalthough the shape of the leaf and the ramifications of the plant excite\r\nhis curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe rivers, with their innumerable branches, are the only means of\r\ntraversing the country. Astronomical observations, or in the absence of\r\nthese, determinations by compass of the bends of the rivers, between the\r\nOrinoco, the Cassiquiare, and the Rio Negro, have shewn that two lonely\r\nmission-stations might be situated only a few miles apart, and yet the\r\nmonks thereof, in visiting each other would require a day and a half to\r\nmake the passage in their hollow-tree canoes, along the windings of small\r\nstreams. The most striking evidence of the impenetrability of some\r\nportions of these forests, is afforded by a trait in the habits of the\r\nAmerican tiger, or panther-like Jaguar. While the introduction of European\r\nhorned cattle, horses, and mules, has yielded so abundant a supply of food\r\nto the beasts of prey in the extensive grassy and treeless plains of\r\nVarinas, Meta, and Buenos Ayres; that these animals, (owing to the unequal\r\ncontest between them and their prey,) have considerably increased since\r\nthe discovery of America; other individuals of the same species lead a\r\ntoilsome life in the dense forests contiguous to the sources of the\r\nOrinoco. The distressing loss of a large mastiff, the faithful companion\r\nof our travels, while we were bivouacking near the junction of the\r\nCassiquiare with the Orinoco, induced us on our return from the\r\ninsect-swarming Esmeralda, to pass another night on the same spot\r\n(uncertain whether he was devoured by a tiger) where we had already long\r\nsought him in vain. We again heard in the immediate neighbourhood the\r\ncries of the Jaguar, probably the very same animal to which we owed our\r\nloss. As the cloudy state of the sky rendered it impossible to conduct\r\nastronomical observations, we made our interpreter (_lenguaraz_) repeat to\r\nus what the natives, our boatmen, related of the tigers of the country.\r\n\r\nThe so called black Jaguar is, as we learnt, not unfrequently found among\r\nthem. It is the largest and most blood-thirsty variety, and has a dark\r\nbrown skin marked with scarcely distinguishable black spots. It lives at\r\nthe foot of the mountain ranges of Maraguaca and Unturan. “The love of\r\nwandering, and the rapacity of the Jaguars,” said our Indian narrator, one\r\nof the Durimond tribe; “often lead them into such impenetrable thickets of\r\nthe forest, that they can no longer hunt on the ground, and then live for\r\na long time in the trees—the terror of the families of monkeys, and of the\r\nprehensile-tailed viverra. (_Cercoleptes._)”\r\n\r\nThe journal which I wrote at the time in German, and from which I borrow\r\nthese extracts, was not entirely exhausted in the narrative of my travels\r\n(published in French). It contains a circumstantial description of the\r\nnocturnal life of animals; I might say, of their nocturnal voices in the\r\ntropical forests. And this sketch seems to me to be especially adapted to\r\nconstitute one of the chapters of the _Views of Nature_. That which is\r\nwritten down on the spot, or soon after the impression of the phenomena\r\nhas been received, may at least claim to possess more freshness than what\r\nis produced by the recollection of long passed events.\r\n\r\nWe reached the bed of the Orinoco by descending from west to east along\r\nthe Rio Apure, whose inundations I have noticed in the sketch of the\r\nDeserts and Steppes. It was the period of low water, and the average\r\nbreadth of the Apure was only a little more than 1200 feet; while the\r\nOrinoco, at its confluence with the Apure (near the granite rocks of\r\nCuriquima, where I was able to measure a base-line), was still upwards of\r\n12,180 feet. Yet this point (the rock of Curiquima,) is 400 miles in a\r\nstraight line from the sea and from the delta of the Orinoco. Some of the\r\nplains, watered by the Apure and the Payara, are inhabited by Yaruros and\r\nAchaguas, who are called savages in the mission-villages established by\r\nthe monks, because they will not relinquish their independence. In\r\nreference to social culture, they however occupy about the same scale as\r\nthose Indians, who, although baptized and living “under the bell” (_baxo\r\nla campana_), have remained strangers to every form of instruction and\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the Island del Diamante, where the Zambos, who speak Spanish,\r\ncultivate the sugar-cane, we entered into a grand and wild domain of\r\nnature. The air was filled with countless flamingoes (_Phœnicopterus_) and\r\nother water-fowl, which seemed to stand forth from the blue sky like a\r\ndark cloud in ever-varying outlines. The bed of the river had here\r\ncontracted to less than 1000 feet, and formed a perfectly straight canal,\r\nwhich was inclosed on both sides by thick woods. The margin of the forest\r\npresents a singular spectacle. In front of the almost impenetrable wall of\r\ncolossal trunks of Cæsalpinia, Cedrela, and Desmanthus, there rises with\r\nthe greatest regularity on the sandy bank of the river, a low hedge of\r\nSauso, only four feet high; it consists of a small shrub, _Hermesia\r\ncastanifolia_, which forms a new genus[68] of the family of Euphorbiaceæ.\r\nA few slender, thorny palms, called by the Spaniards Piritu and Corozo\r\n(perhaps species of _Martinezia_ or _Bactris_) stand close alongside; the\r\nwhole resembling a trimmed garden hedge, with gate-like openings at\r\nconsiderable distances from each other, formed undoubtedly by the large\r\nfour-footed animals of the forests, for convenient access to the river. At\r\nsunset, and more particularly at break of day, the American Tiger, the\r\nTapir, and the Peccary (_Pecari_, _Dicotyles_) may be seen coming forth\r\nfrom these openings accompanied by their young, to give them drink. When\r\nthey are disturbed by a passing Indian canoe, and are about to retreat\r\ninto the forest, they do not attempt to rush violently through these\r\nhedges of Sauso, but proceed deliberately along the bank, between the\r\nhedge and river, affording the traveller the gratification of watching\r\ntheir motions for sometimes four or five hundred paces, until they\r\ndisappear through the nearest opening. During a seventy-four days’ almost\r\nuninterrupted river navigation of 1520 miles up the Orinoco, to the\r\nneighbourhood of its sources, and along the Cassiquiare, and the Rio\r\nNegro—during the whole of which time we were confined to a narrow\r\ncanoe—the same spectacle presented itself to our view at many different\r\npoints, and, I may add, always with renewed excitement. There came to\r\ndrink, bathe, or fish, groups of creatures belonging to the most opposite\r\nspecies of animals; the larger mammalia with many-coloured herons,\r\npalamedeas with the proudly-strutting curassow (_Crax Alector_, _C.\r\nPauxi_). “It is here as in Paradise” (_es como en el Paradiso_), remarked\r\nwith pious air our steersman, an old Indian, who had been brought up in\r\nthe house of an ecclesiastic. But the gentle peace of the primitive golden\r\nage does not reign in the paradise of these American animals, they stand\r\napart, watch, and avoid each other. The Capybara, a cavy (or river-hog)\r\nthree or four feet long (a colossal repetition of the common Brazilian\r\ncavy, (_Cavia Aguti_), is devoured in the river by the crocodile, and on\r\nthe shore by the tiger. They run so badly, that we were frequently able to\r\novertake and capture several from among the numerous herds.\r\n\r\nBelow the mission of Santa Barbara de Arichuna we passed the night as\r\nusual in the open air, on a sandy flat, on the bank of the Apure, skirted\r\nby the impenetrable forest. We had some difficulty in finding dry wood to\r\nkindle the fires with which it is here customary to surround the bivouac,\r\nas a safeguard against the attacks of the Jaguar. The air was bland and\r\nsoft, and the moon shone brightly. Several crocodiles approached the bank;\r\nand I have observed that fire attracts these creatures as it does our\r\ncrabs and many other aquatic animals. The oars of our boats were fixed\r\nupright in the ground, to support our hammocks. Deep stillness prevailed,\r\nonly broken at intervals by the blowing of the fresh-water dolphins[69],\r\nwhich are peculiar to the river net-work of the Orinoco (as, according to\r\nColebrooke, they are also to the Ganges, as high up the river as Benares);\r\nthey followed each other in long tracks.\r\n\r\nAfter eleven o’clock, such a noise began in the contiguous forest, that\r\nfor the remainder of the night all sleep was impossible. The wild cries of\r\nanimals rung through the woods. Among the many voices which resounded\r\ntogether, the Indians could only recognise those which, after short\r\npauses, were heard singly. There was the monotonous, plaintive, cry of the\r\nAluates (howling monkeys), the whining, flute-like notes of the small\r\nsapajous, the grunting murmur of the striped nocturnal ape[70]\r\n(_Nyctipithecus trivirgatus_, which I was the first to describe), the\r\nfitful roar of the great tiger, the Cuguar or maneless American lion, the\r\npeccary, the sloth, and a host of parrots, parraquas (_Ortalides_), and\r\nother pheasant-like birds. Whenever the tigers approached the edge of the\r\nforest, our dog, who before had barked incessantly, came howling to seek\r\nprotection under the hammocks. Sometimes the cry of the tiger resounded\r\nfrom the branches of a tree, and was then always accompanied by the\r\nplaintive piping tones of the apes, who were endeavouring to escape from\r\nthe unwonted pursuit.\r\n\r\nIf one asks the Indians why such a continuous noise is heard on certain\r\nnights, they answer, with a smile, that “the animals are rejoicing in the\r\nbeautiful moonlight, and celebrating the return of the full moon.” To me\r\nthe scene appeared rather to be owing to an accidental, long-continued,\r\nand gradually increasing conflict among the animals. Thus, for instance,\r\nthe jaguar will pursue the peccaries and the tapirs, which, densely\r\ncrowded together, burst through the barrier of tree-like shrubs which\r\nopposes their flight. Terrified at the confusion, the monkeys on the tops\r\nof the trees join their cries with those of the larger animals. This\r\narouses the tribes of birds who build their nests in communities, and\r\nsuddenly the whole animal world is in a state of commotion. Further\r\nexperience taught us, that it was by no means always the festival of\r\nmoonlight that disturbed the stillness of the forest; for we observed that\r\nthe voices were loudest during violent storms of rain, or when the thunder\r\nechoed and the lightning flashed through the depths of the woods. The\r\ngood-natured Franciscan monk who (notwithstanding the fever from which he\r\nhad been suffering for many months), accompanied us through the cataracts\r\nof Atures and Maypures to San Carlos, on the Rio Negro, and to the\r\nBrazilian coast, used to say, when apprehensive of a storm at night, “May\r\nHeaven grant a quiet night both to us and to the wild beasts of the\r\nforest!”\r\n\r\nA singular contrast to the scenes I have here described, and which I had\r\nrepeated opportunities of witnessing, is presented by the stillness which\r\nreigns within the tropics at the noontide of a day unusually sultry. I\r\nborrow from the same journal the description of a scene at the Narrows of\r\nBaraguan. Here the Orinoco forms for itself a passage through the western\r\npart of the mountains of the Parime. That which is called at this\r\nremarkable pass a Narrow (_Angostura del Baraguan_), is, however, a basin\r\nalmost 5700 feet in breadth. With the exception of an old withered stem of\r\nAubletia (_Apeiba Tiburbu_), and a new Apocinea (_Allamanda Salicifolia_),\r\nthe barren rocks were only covered with a few silvery croton shrubs. A\r\nthermometer observed in the shade, but brought within a few inches of the\r\nlofty mass of granite rock, rose to more than 122° Fahr. All distant\r\nobjects had wavy undulating outlines, the optical effect of the _mirage_.\r\nNot a breath of air moved the dust-like sand. The sun stood in the zenith;\r\nand the effulgence of light poured upon the river, and which, owing to a\r\ngentle ripple of the waters, was brilliantly reflected, gave additional\r\ndistinctness to the red haze which veiled the distance. All the rocky\r\nmounds and naked boulders were covered with large, thick-scaled Iguanas,\r\nGecko-lizards, and spotted Salamanders. Motionless, with uplifted heads\r\nand widely extended mouths, they seemed to inhale the heated air with\r\necstasy. The larger animals at such times take refuge in the deep recesses\r\nof the forest, the birds nestle beneath the foliage of the trees, or in\r\nthe clefts of the rocks; but if in this apparent stillness of nature we\r\nlisten closely for the faintest tones, we detect, a dull, muffled sound, a\r\nbuzzing and humming of insects close to the earth, in the lower strata of\r\nthe atmosphere. Everything proclaims a world of active organic forces. In\r\nevery shrub, in the cracked bark of trees, in the perforated ground\r\ninhabited by hymenopterous insects, life is everywhere audibly manifest.\r\nIt is one of the many voices of nature revealed to the pious and\r\nsusceptible spirit of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ILLUSTRATIONS AND ADDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\np. 191.—“_Characteristic denominations in Arabic and Persian._”\r\n\r\nMore than twenty words might be cited by which the Arabs distinguish\r\nbetween a Steppe (tanufah), according as it may be a Desert without\r\nwater, entirely bare, or covered with siliceous sand, and interspersed\r\nwith spots of pasture land (Sahara, Kafr, Mikfar, Tih, Mehme).

A sketch of the\r\nIllimani, as it appears in all its majesty from La Paz, was given at an\r\nearlier date by Mr. Pentland in the Journal of the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety.[IO] But this was five years after the publication of the first\r\nmeasurements in the _Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes_ for 1830, p.\r\n323, which results I myself hastened to disseminate in Germany.[IP] The\r\nNevado de Sorata lies to the east of the village of Sorata or Esquibel,\r\nand is called in the Ymarra language, according to Pentland, Ancomani,\r\nItampu, and Illhampu. In _Illimani_ we recognize the Ymarra word _illi_,\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nIf, however, in the _eastern_ chain of Bolivia the Sorata was long\r\nassumed to be 3962 feet, and the Illimani 2851 feet too high, there are\r\nin the western chain of Bolivia, according to Pentland’s map of Titicaca\r\n(1848), four peaks east of Arica between the latitudes 18° 7′ and 18°\r\n25′, all of which exceed Chimborazo in height, which itself is 21,422\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThese four peaks are:—\r\n\r\n                            English feet. French feet.\r\n                 Pomarape          21,700       20,360\r\n                 Gualateiri        21,960       20,604\r\n                 Parinacota        22,030       20,670\r\n                 Sahama            22,350       20,971\r\n\r\nBerghaus has applied to the chains of the Andes in Bolivia, the\r\ninvestigation which I published[IQ] regarding the proportion, which\r\nvaries extremely in different mountain-chains, of the mountain ridge\r\n(the mean height of the passes), to the highest summits (or the\r\nculminating points). He finds,[IR] according to Pentland’s map, that the\r\nmean height of the passes in the eastern chain is 13,505, and in the\r\nwestern chain 14,496 feet. The culminating points are 21,285 and 22,350\r\nfeet; consequently the ratio of the height of the ridge to that of the\r\nhighest summit is, in the eastern chain, as 1 : 1·57, and in the western\r\nchain as 1 : 1·54. This ratio, which is, as it were, the measure of the\r\nsubterranean upheaving force, is very similar to that in the Pyrenees,\r\nbut very different from the plastic form of the Alps, the mean height of\r\nwhose passes is far less in comparison with the height of Mont Blanc. In\r\nthe Pyrenees these ratios are as 1 : 1·43, and in the Alps as 1 : 2·09.\r\n\r\nBut, according to Fitzroy and Darwin, the height of the Sahama is still\r\nsurpassed by 848 feet by that of the volcano Aconcagua (south lat. 32°\r\n39′), in the north-east of Valparaiso in Chili. The officers of the\r\nexpedition of the Adventure and Beagle found, in August 1835, that the\r\nAconcagua was between 23,000 and 23,400 feet in height. If we reckon it\r\nat 23,200 feet it is 1776 feet, higher than Chimborazo.[IS] According to\r\nmore recent calculations,[IT] Aconcagua is determined to be 23,906 feet.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge regarding the systems of mountains, which, north of the\r\nparallels of 30° and 31°, are distinguished as the _Rocky Mountains_ and\r\nthe _Sierra Nevada of California_, has been vastly augmented during the\r\nlast few years in the astronomico-geographical, hypsometric, geognostic,\r\nand botanical departments, by the excellent works of Charles\r\nFrémont,[IU] of Dr. Wislizenus,[IV] and of Lieutenants Abert and\r\nPeck.[IW] There prevails throughout these North American works a\r\nscientific spirit deserving of the warmest acknowledgment. The\r\nremarkable plateau, referred to in p. 34, between the Rocky Mountains\r\nand the Sierra Nevada of California, which rises uninterruptedly from\r\n4000 to 5000 French (4260 to 5330 English) feet high, and is termed the\r\nGreat Basin, presents an interior closed river-system, thermal springs,\r\nand salt lakes. None of its rivers, Bear River, Carson River, and\r\nHumboldt River, find a passage to the sea. That which, by a process of\r\ninduction and combination, I represented in my great map of Mexico,\r\nexecuted in 1804, as the Lake of Timpanogos, is the _Great Salt Lake_ of\r\nFrémont’s map. It is 60 miles long from north to south, and 40 miles\r\nbroad, and it communicates with the fresh-water Lake of Utah, which lies\r\nat a higher level, and into which the Timpanogos or Timpanaozu River\r\nenters from the eastward, in lat. 40° 13′. The fact of the Lake of\r\nTimpanogos not having been placed in my map sufficiently to the north\r\nand west, arose from the entire absence, at that period, of all\r\nastronomical determinations of position of Santa Fé in New Mexico. For\r\nthe western margin of the lake the error amounts to almost fifty\r\nminutes, a difference of absolute longitude which will appear less\r\nstriking when it is remembered that my itinerary map of Guanaxuato could\r\nonly be based for an extent of 15° of latitude on determinations made by\r\nthe compass (magnetic surveys), instituted by Don Pedro de Rivera.[IX]\r\nThese determinations gave my talented and prematurely lost\r\nfellow-labourer, Herr Friesen, 105° 36′ as the longitude of Santa Fé,\r\nwhile, by other combinations, I calculated it at 104° 51′. According to\r\nactual astronomical determinations the true longitude appears to be\r\n106°. The relative position of the strata of rock salt found in thick\r\nstrata of red clay, south-east of the Great Salt Lake (Laguna de\r\nTimpanogos), with its many islands, and near the present Fort Mormon and\r\nthe Utah Lake, is accurately given in my large map of Mexico. I may\r\nrefer to the most recent evidence of the traveller who made the first\r\ntrustworthy determinations of position in this region. “The mineral or\r\nrock salt, of which a specimen is placed in Congress Library, was found\r\nin the place marked by Humboldt in his map of New Spain (northern half),\r\nas derived from the journal of the Missionary Father Escalante, who\r\nattempted (1777) to penetrate the unknown country from Santa Fé of New\r\nMexico to Monterey of the Pacific Ocean. South-east of the Lake\r\nTimpanogos is the chain of the Wha-satch Mountains; and in this, at the\r\nplace where Humboldt has written _Montagnes de sel gemme_, this mineral\r\nis found.”[IY]\r\n\r\nA great historical interest is attached to this part of the highland,\r\nespecially to the neighbourhood of the Lake of Timpanogos, which is\r\nprobably identical with the Lake of Teguayo, the ancestral seat of the\r\nAztecs. This people, in their migration from Aztlan to Tula, and to the\r\nvalley of Tenochtitlan in Mexico, made three stations at which the ruins\r\nof _Casas grandes_ are still to be seen. The first halting-place of the\r\nAztecs was at the Lake of Teguayo, south of Quivira, the second on the\r\nRio Gila, and the third not far from the Presidio de Llanos. Lieutenant\r\nAbert found on the banks of the Rio Gila the same immense quantity of\r\nelegantly painted fragments of delf and pottery scattered over a large\r\nsurface of country, which, at the same place, had excited so much\r\nastonishment in the missionaries Francisco Garces and Pedro Fonte. From\r\nthese products of the hand of man, it may be inferred that there was a\r\ntime when a higher human civilization existed in this now desolate\r\nregion. Repetitions of the singular architectural style of the Aztecs,\r\nand of their houses of seven stories, are at the present time to be\r\nfound far to the east of the Rio Grande del Norte; as, for instance, at\r\nTaos.[IZ] The Sierra Nevada of California is parallel to the coast of\r\nthe Pacific; but between the latitudes of 34° and 41°, between San\r\nBuenaventura and the Bay of Trinidad, there runs, west of the Sierra\r\nNevada, a small coast chain whose culminating point, _Monte del Diablo_,\r\nis 3674 feet high. In the narrow valley, between this coast chain and\r\nthe great Sierra Nevada, flow from the south the Rio de San Joaquin, and\r\nfrom the north the Rio del Sacramento. It is in the alluvial soil on the\r\nbanks of the latter river that the rich goldwashings occur, which are\r\nnow proceeding with so much activity.\r\n\r\nBesides the hypsometric levelling and the barometric measurements to\r\nwhich I have already referred (see page 33), between the mouth of the\r\nKanzas River in the Missouri and the coast of the Pacific, throughout\r\nthe immense expanse of 28° of longitude, Dr. Wislizenus has successfully\r\nprosecuted the levelling commenced by myself in the equinoctial zone of\r\nMexico, to the north as far as to lat. 35° 38′, and consequently to\r\nSanta Fé del Nuevo Mexico. We learn with astonishment that the plateau\r\nwhich forms the broad crest of the Mexican Andes by no means sinks down\r\nto an inconsiderable height, as was long supposed to be the case.

To the\r\nvaluable memoir of Dr. Wislizenus there are appended three profile\r\ndelineations of the country; one from Santa Fé to Chihuahua over Passo\r\ndel Norte; one from Chihuahua over Parras to Reynosa; and one from Fort\r\nIndependence (a little to the east of the confluence of the Missouri and\r\nthe Kanzas River) to Santa Fé. The calculation is based on daily\r\ncorresponding observations of the barometer, made by Engelmann at St.\r\nLouis, and by Lilly in New Orleans. If we consider that in the north and\r\nsouth direction the difference of latitude between Santa Fé and Mexico\r\nis more than 16°, and that, consequently, the distance in a direct\r\nmeridian direction, independently of curvatures on the road, is more\r\nthan 960 miles; we are led to ask whether, in the whole world, there\r\nexists any similar formation of equal extent and height (between 5000\r\nand 7500 feet above the level of the sea). Four-wheeled waggons can\r\ntravel from Mexico to Santa Fé. The plateau, whose levelling I have here\r\ndescribed, is formed solely by the broad, undulating, flattened crest of\r\nthe chain of the Mexican Andes; it is not the swelling of a valley\r\nbetween two mountain-chains, such as the “Great Basin” between the Rocky\r\nMountains and the Sierra Nevada of California, in the Northern\r\nHemisphere, or the elevated plateau of the Lake of Titicaca, between the\r\neastern and western chains of Bolivia, or the plateau of Thibet, between\r\nthe Himalaya and the Kuen-lün, in the Southern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 IDEAS\r\n                                 FOR A\r\n                         PHYSIOGNOMY OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the active spirit of man is directed to the investigation of\r\nnature, or when in imagination he scans the vast fields of organic\r\ncreation, among the varied emotions excited in his mind there is none\r\nmore profound or vivid than that awakened by the universal profusion of\r\nlife. Everywhere—even near the ice-bound poles,—the air resounds with\r\nthe song of birds and with the busy hum of insects. Not only the lower\r\nstrata, in which the denser vapours float, but also the higher and\r\nethereal regions of the air, teem with animal life. Whenever the lofty\r\ncrests of, the Peruvian Cordilleras, or the summit of Mont Blanc, south\r\nof Lake Leman, have been ascended, living creatures have been found even\r\nin these solitudes. On the Chimborazo[71], which is upwards of eight\r\nthousand feet higher than Mount Etna, we saw butterflies and other\r\nwinged insects. Even if they are strangers carried by ascending currents\r\nof air to those lofty regions, whither a restless spirit of inquiry\r\nleads the toilsome steps of man, their presence nevertheless proves that\r\nthe more pliant organization of animals may subsist far beyond the\r\nlimits of the vegetable world. The Condor[72], that giant among the\r\nvultures, often soared above us at a greater altitude than the summits\r\nof the Andes, and even higher than would be the Peak of Teneriffe were\r\nit piled upon the snow-crowned summits of the Pyrenees. Rapacity and the\r\npursuit of the soft-woolled Vicunas, which herd, like the chamois, on\r\nthe snow-covered pastures, allure this powerful bird to these regions.\r\n\r\nBut if the unassisted eye shows that life is diffused throughout the\r\nwhole atmosphere, the microscope reveals yet greater wonders.\r\nWheel-animalcules, _brachioni_, and a host of microscopic insects are\r\nlifted by the winds from the evaporating waters below. Motionless and to\r\nall appearance dead, they float on the breeze, until the dew bears them\r\nback to the nourishing earth, and bursting the tissue which incloses\r\ntheir transparent rotating[73] bodies, instils new life and motion into\r\nall their organs, probably by the action of the vital principle inherent\r\nin water. The yellow meteoric sand or mist (dust nebulæ) often observed\r\nto fall on the Atlantic near the Cape de Verde Islands, and not\r\nunfrequently borne in an easterly direction as far as Northern Africa,\r\nItaly, and Central Europe, consists, according to Ehrenberg’s brilliant\r\ndiscovery, of agglomerations of siliceous-shelled microscopic organisms.\r\nMany of these perhaps float for years in the highest strata of the\r\natmosphere, until they are carried down by the Etesian winds or by\r\ndescending currents of air, in the full capacity of life, and actually\r\nengaged in organic increase by spontaneous self division.\r\n\r\nTogether with these developed creatures, the atmosphere contains\r\ncountless germs of future formations; eggs of insects, and seeds of\r\nplants, which, by means of hairy or feathery crowns, are borne forward\r\non their long autumnal journey. Even the vivifying pollen scattered\r\nabroad by the male blossoms, is carried by winds and winged insects over\r\nsea and land, to the distant and solitary female plant[74]. Thus,\r\nwheresoever the naturalist turns his eye, life or the germ of life lies\r\nspread before him.\r\n\r\nBut if the moving sea of air in which we are immersed, and above whose\r\nsurface we are unable to raise ourselves, yields to many organic beings\r\ntheir most essential nourishment, they still require therewith a more\r\nsubstantial species of food, which is provided for them only at the\r\nbottom of this gaseous ocean. This bottom is of a twofold kind: the\r\nsmaller portion constituting the dry earth, in immediate contact with\r\nthe surrounding atmosphere; the larger portion consisting of\r\nwater,—formed, perhaps, thousands of years ago from gaseous matters\r\nfused by electric fire, and now incessantly undergoing decomposition in\r\nthe laboratory of the clouds and in the pulsating vessels of animals and\r\nplants. Organic forms descend deep into the womb of the earth, wherever\r\nthe meteoric rain-waters can penetrate into natural cavities, or into\r\nartificial excavations and mines. The domain of the subterranean\r\ncryptogamic flora was early an object of my scientific researches.\r\nThermal springs of the highest temperature nourish small Hydropores,\r\nConfervæ and Oscillatoræ. Not far from the Arctic circle, at Bear Lake,\r\nin the New Continent, Richardson saw flowering plants on the ground\r\nwhich, even in summer, remains frozen to the depth of twenty inches.\r\n\r\nIt is still undetermined where life is most abundant: whether on the\r\nearth or in the fathomless depths of the ocean. Ehrenberg’s admirable\r\nwork on the relative condition of animalcular life in the tropical ocean\r\nand the floating and solid ice of the Antarctic circle, has spread the\r\nsphere and horizon of organic life before our eyes. Siliceous-shelled\r\nPolygastrica and even Coscinodiscæ, alive, with their green ovaries,\r\nhave been found enveloped in masses within twelve degrees of the Pole;\r\neven as the small black glacier flea, _Desoria Glacialis_, and\r\nPodurellæ, inhabit the narrow tubules of ice of the Swiss glaciers, as\r\nproved by the researches of Agassiz. Ehrenberg has shown that on some\r\nmicroscopic infusorial animalcules (_Synedra_ and _Cocconeis_), other\r\nspecies live parasitically; and that in the Gallionellæ the\r\nextraordinary powers of division and development of bulk are so great,\r\nthat an animalcule invisible to the naked eye can in four days form two\r\ncubic feet of the Bilin polishing slate.\r\n\r\nIn the ocean, gelatinous sea-worms, living and dead, shine like luminous\r\nstars[75], converting by their phosphorescent light the green surface of\r\nthe ocean into one vast sheet of fire. Indelible is the impression left\r\non my mind by those calm tropical nights of the Pacific, where the\r\nconstellation of Argo in its zenith, and the setting Southern Cross,\r\npour their mild planetary light through the ethereal azure of the sky,\r\nwhile dolphins mark the foaming waves with their luminous furrows.\r\n\r\nBut not alone the depths of ocean, the waters, too, of our own swamps\r\nand marshes, conceal innumerable worms of wonderful form. Almost\r\nindistinguishable by the eye are the Cyclidiæ, the Euglenes, and the\r\nhost of Naiads divisible by branches like the _Lemna_ (Duckweed), whose\r\nleafy shade they seek. Surrounded by differently composed atmospheres,\r\nand deprived of light, the spotted Ascaris breathes in the skin of the\r\nearth-worm, the silvery and bright Leucophra exists in the body of the\r\nshore Nais, and a Pentastoma in the large pulmonary cells of the\r\ntropical rattle-snake[76]. There are animalcules in the blood of frogs\r\nand salmon, and even, according to Nordmann, in the fluid of the eyes of\r\nfishes, and in the gills of the bream. Thus are even the most hidden\r\nrecesses of creation replete with life. We purpose in the following\r\npages to consider the different families of plants, since on their\r\nexistence entirely depends that of the animal creation. Incessantly are\r\nthey occupied in organizing the raw material of the earth, assimilating\r\nby vital forces those elements which after a thousand metamorphoses\r\nbecome ennobled into active nervous tissue. The glance which we direct\r\nto the dissemination of vegetable forms, reveals to us the fulness of\r\nthat animal life which they sustain and preserve.\r\n\r\nThe verdant carpet which a luxuriant Flora spreads over the surface of\r\nthe earth is not woven equally in all parts; for while it is most rich\r\nand full where, under an ever-cloudless sky, the sun attains its\r\ngreatest height, it is thin and scanty near the torpid poles, where the\r\nquickly-recurring frosts too speedily blight the opening bud or destroy\r\nthe ripening fruit. Yet everywhere man rejoices in the presence of\r\nnourishing plants. Even where from the depths of the sea, a volcano\r\nbursting through the boiling flood, upheaves a scoriaceous rock. (as\r\nonce happened in the Greek Islands); or, to instance a more gradual\r\nphenomenon, where the united labours of the coral animal\r\n(Lithophytes)[77] have piled up their cellular dwellings, on the crests\r\nof submarine mountains, until after toiling for thousands of years their\r\nedifice reaches the level of the ocean, when its architects perish, and\r\nleave a coral island. Thus are organic forces ever ready to animate with\r\nliving forms the naked rock. How seeds are so suddenly transported to\r\nthese rocks, whether by birds, or by winds, or by the waves of ocean, is\r\na question that cannot be decided, owing to the great distance of these\r\nislands from the coasts. But no sooner has the air greeted the naked\r\nrock, than, in our northern countries, it gradually acquires a covering\r\nof velvet-like fibres, which appear to the eye to be coloured spots.\r\nSome of these are bordered by single and others by double rows, while\r\nothers again are traversed by furrows and divided into compartments. As\r\nthey increase in age their colour darkens. The bright glittering yellow\r\nbecomes brown, and gradually the bluish-grey mass of the Leprariæ\r\nchanges to a dusty black. As the outlines of this vegetable surface\r\nmerge into each other with increasing age, the dark ground acquires a\r\nnew covering of fresh circular spots of dazzling whiteness. Thus one\r\norganic tissue rises, like strata, over the other; and as the human race\r\nin its development must pass through definite stages of civilization, so\r\nalso is the gradual distribution of plants dependent on definite\r\nphysical laws. In spots where lofty forest trees now rear their towering\r\nsummits, the sole covering of the barren rock was once the tender\r\nlichen; the long and immeasurable interval was filled up by the growth\r\nof grasses, herbaceous plants, and shrubs. The place occupied in\r\nnorthern regions by mosses and lichens is supplied in the tropics by\r\nPortulacas, Gomphrenas, and other low and oleaginous marine plants. The\r\nhistory of the vegetable covering and of its gradual extension over the\r\nbarren surface of the earth, has its epochs, as well as that of the\r\nmigratory animal world.\r\n\r\nBut although life is everywhere diffused, and although the organic\r\nforces are incessantly at work in combining into new forms those\r\nelements which have been liberated by death; yet this fulness of life\r\nand its renovation differ according to difference of climate. Nature\r\nundergoes a periodic stagnation in the frigid zones; for fluidity is\r\nessential to life. Animals and plants, excepting indeed mosses and other\r\nCryptogamia, here remain many months buried in a winter sleep. Over a\r\ngreat portion of the earth, therefore, only those organic forms are\r\ncapable of full development, which have the property of resisting any\r\nconsiderable abstraction of heat, or those which, destitute of\r\nleaf-organs, can sustain a protracted interruption of their vital\r\nfunctions. Thus, the nearer we approach the tropics, the greater the\r\nincrease in variety of structure, grace of form, and mixture of colours,\r\nas also in perpetual youth and vigour of organic life.\r\n\r\nThis increase may readily be doubted by those who have never quitted our\r\nown hemisphere, or who have neglected the study of physical geography.\r\nWhen in passing from our thickly foliated forests of oak, we cross the\r\nAlps or the Pyrenees and enter Italy or Spain, or when the traveller\r\nfirst directs his eye to some of the African coasts of the\r\nMediterranean, he may easily be led to adopt the erroneous inference\r\nthat absence of trees is a characteristic of hot climates. But they\r\nforget that Southern Europe wore a different aspect, when it was first\r\ncolonised by Pelasgian or Carthaginian settlers; they forget too that an\r\nearlier civilization of the human race sets bounds to the increase of\r\nforests, and that nations, in their change-loving spirit, gradually\r\ndestroy the decorations which rejoice our eye in the North, and which,\r\nmore than the records of history, attest the youthfulness of our\r\ncivilization. The great catastrophe by which the Mediterranean was\r\nformed, when the swollen waters of an inland sea burst their way through\r\nthe Dardanelles and the Pillars of Hercules, appears to have stripped\r\nthe contiguous lands of a large portion of their alluvial soil. The\r\nrecords of the Samothracian traditions[78] preserved by Greek writers\r\nseem to indicate the recent date of this great convulsion of nature.\r\nMoreover, in all the lands bathed by the Mediterranean, and which are\r\ncharacterised by the tertiary and cretaceous formations (Nummulites and\r\nNeocomian rocks), a great portion of the earth’s surface is naked rock.\r\nThe picturesque beauty of Italian scenery depends mainly on the pleasing\r\ncontrast between the bare and desolate rock and the luxuriant vegetation\r\nwhich, island-like, is scattered over its surface. Where the rock is\r\nless intersected by fissures, so that the water rests longer on its\r\nsurface, and where it is covered with earth (as on the enchanting banks\r\nof Lake Albano), there even Italy has her oak-forests, as shady and\r\nverdant as could be desired by an inhabitant of the North.\r\n\r\nThe boundless plains or steppes of South America, and the deserts beyond\r\nthe Atlas range of mountains, can only be regarded as mere local\r\nphenomena. The former are found to be covered, at least in the rainy\r\nseason, with grasses and low almost herbaceous Mimosæ; while the latter\r\nare seas of sand in the interior of the Old Continent,—vast arid tracts\r\nsurrounded by borders of evergreen forests. Here and there only a few\r\nisolated fan-palms remind the wanderer that these dreary solitudes are a\r\nportion of animated nature. Amid the optical delusions occasioned by the\r\nradiation of heat, we see the bases of these trees at one moment\r\nhovering in the air, at the next their inverted image reflected in the\r\nundulating strata of the atmosphere. To the west of the Peruvian Andes,\r\non the shores of the Pacific, I have passed weeks in traversing these\r\nwaterless deserts.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this absence of plants over large tracts of land, in\r\nregions characterised on every side by the most exuberant vegetation, is\r\na geological phenomenon which has hitherto received but little\r\nattention; it undoubtedly arises from former revolutions of nature, such\r\nas inundations, or from volcanic convulsions of the earth’s surface.\r\nWhen once a region loses its vegetable covering, if the sand is loose\r\nand devoid of springs, and if vertically ascending currents of heated\r\nair prevent the precipitation of vapour[79], thousands of years may\r\nelapse before organic life can penetrate from the green shores to the\r\ninterior of the dreary waste.\r\n\r\nThose who are capable of surveying nature with a comprehensive glance,\r\nand abstract their attention from local phenomena, cannot fail to\r\nobserve that organic development and abundance of vitality gradually\r\nincrease from the poles towards the equator, in proportion to the\r\nincrease of animating heat. But in this distribution every different\r\nclimate has allotted to it some beauty peculiar to itself: to the\r\nTropics belong variety and magnitude in vegetable forms; to the North\r\nthe aspect of its meadows and the periodical renovation of nature at the\r\nfirst genial breath of spring. Every zone, besides its own peculiar\r\nadvantages, has its own distinctive character. The primeval force of\r\norganization, notwithstanding a certain independence in the abnormal\r\ndevelopment of individual parts, binds all animal and vegetable\r\nstructures to fixed ever-recurring types. For as in some individual\r\norganic beings we recognise a definite physiognomy, and as descriptive\r\nbotany and zoology are, strictly speaking, analyses of animal and\r\nvegetable forms, so also there is a certain natural physiognomy peculiar\r\nto every region of the earth.\r\n\r\nThat which the painter designates by the expressions “Swiss scenery” or\r\n“Italian sky” is based on a vague feeling of the local natural\r\ncharacter. The azure of the sky, the effects of light and shade, the\r\nhaze floating on the distant horizon, the forms of animals, the\r\nsucculence of plants, the bright glossy surface of the leaves, the\r\noutlines of mountains, all combine to produce the elements on which\r\ndepends the impression of any one region. It must be admitted, however,\r\nthat in all latitudes the same kind of rocks, as trachyte, basalt,\r\nporphyritic schist, and dolomite, form mountain groups of exactly\r\nsimilar physiognomy. Thus the greenstone cliffs of South America and\r\nMexico resemble those of the Fichtel mountains of Germany, in like\r\nmanner as among animals, the form of the Allco, or the original canine\r\nrace of the New Continent, is analogous to that of the European race.\r\nThe inorganic crust of the earth is as it were independent of climatic\r\ninfluences; perhaps, because diversity of climate arising from\r\ndifference of latitude is of more recent date than the formations of the\r\nearth, or that the hardening crust, in solidifying and discharging its\r\ncaloric, acquired its temperature from internal and not from external\r\ncauses[80]. All formations are, therefore, common to every quarter of\r\nthe globe and assume the like forms. Everywhere basalt rises in twin\r\nmountains and truncated cones; everywhere trap-porphyry presents itself\r\nto the eye under the form of grotesquely-shaped masses of rock, while\r\ngranite terminates in gently rounded summits. Thus, too, similar\r\nvegetable forms, as pines and oaks, alike crown the mountain declivities\r\nof Sweden and those of the most southern portion of Mexico[81]. But\r\nnotwithstanding all this coincidence of form, and resemblance of the\r\noutlines of individual portions, the grouping of the mass, as a whole,\r\npresents the greatest diversity of character.\r\n\r\nAs the oryctognostic knowledge of minerals differs from geology, so also\r\ndoes the general study of the physiognomy of nature differ from the\r\nindividual branches of the natural sciences. The character of certain\r\nportions of the earth’s surface has been described with inimitable\r\ntruthfulness by George Forster in his travels and smaller works, by\r\nGoethe in the descriptive passages which so frequently occur in his\r\nimmortal writings, by Buffon, Bernardin de St. Pierre, and\r\nChateaubriand. Such descriptions are not only calculated to yield an\r\nenjoyment of the noblest kind, but the knowledge of the character of\r\nnature in different regions is also most intimately associated with the\r\nhistory of the human race and its mental culture. For although the dawn\r\nof this culture cannot have been determined solely by physical\r\ninfluence, climatic relations have at any rate to a great extent\r\ninfluenced its direction, as well as the character of nations, and the\r\ndegree of gloom or cheerfulness in the dispositions of men. How\r\npowerfully did the skies of Greece act on its inhabitants! Was it not\r\namong the nations who settled in the beautiful and happy region between\r\nthe Euphrates, the Halys, and the Ægean Sea, that social polish and\r\ngentler feelings were first awakened? and was it not from these genial\r\nclimes that our forefathers, when religious enthusiasm had suddenly\r\nopened to them the Holy Lands of the East, brought back to Europe, then\r\nrelapsing into barbarism, the seeds of a gentler civilization? The\r\npoetical works of the Greeks and the ruder songs of the primitive\r\nnorthern races owe much of their peculiar character to the forms of\r\nplants and animals, to the mountain-valleys in which their poets dwelt,\r\nand to the air which surrounded them. To revert to more familiar\r\nobjects, who is there that does not feel himself differently affected\r\nbeneath the embowering shade of the beechen grove, or on hills crowned\r\nwith a few scattered pines, or in the flowering meadow where the breeze\r\nmurmurs through the trembling foliage of the birch? A feeling of\r\nmelancholy, or solemnity, or of light buoyant animation is in turn\r\nawakened by the contemplation of our native trees. This influence of the\r\nphysical on the moral world—this mysterious reaction of the sensuous on\r\nthe ideal, gives to the study of nature, when considered from a higher\r\npoint of view, a peculiar charm which has not hitherto been sufficiently\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\nHowever much the character of different regions of the earth may depend\r\nupon a combination of all these external phenomena, and however much the\r\ntotal impression may be influenced by the outline of mountains and\r\nhills, the physiognomy of plants and animals, the azure of the sky, the\r\nform of the clouds, and the transparency of the atmosphere, still it\r\ncannot be denied that it is the vegetable covering of the earth’s\r\nsurface which chiefly conduces to the effect. The animal organism is\r\ndeficient in mass, while the mobility of its individual members and\r\noften their diminutiveness remove them from the sphere of our\r\nobservation. Vegetable forms, on the other hand, act on the imagination\r\nby their enduring magnitude—for here massive size is indicative of age,\r\nand in the vegetable kingdom alone are age and the manifestation of an\r\never-renewed vigour linked together. The colossal Dragon Tree[82], which\r\nI saw in the Canary Isles, and which measured more than sixteen feet in\r\ndiameter, still bears, as it then did, the blossoms and fruit of\r\nperpetual youth. When the French adventurers, the Béthencourts,\r\nconquered these Fortunate Isles in the beginning of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, the Dragon Tree of Orotava, regarded by the natives with a\r\nveneration equal to that bestowed on the olive tree of the Acropolis at\r\nAthens, or the elm at Ephesus, was of the same colossal magnitude as at\r\npresent. In the tropics a grove of Hymeneæ and Cesalpiniæ is probably a\r\nmemorial of more than a thousand years.\r\n\r\nOn taking one general view of the different phanerogamic species which\r\nhave already been collected into our herbariums[83], and which may now\r\nbe estimated at considerably more than 80,000, we find that this\r\nprodigious quantity presents some few forms to which most of the others\r\nmay be referred. In determining those forms, on whose individual beauty,\r\ndistribution, and grouping, the physiognomy of a country’s vegetation\r\ndepends, we must not ground our opinion (as from other causes is\r\nnecessarily the case in botanical systems) on the smaller organs of\r\npropagation, that is, the blossoms and fruit; but must be guided solely\r\nby those elements of magnitude and mass from which the total impression\r\nof a district receives its character of individuality. Among the\r\nprincipal forms of vegetation there are, indeed, some which constitute\r\nentire families, according to the so-called “natural system” of\r\nbotanists. Bananas and Palms, Casuarineæ and Coniferæ, form distinct\r\nspecies in this mode of arrangement. The systematising botanist,\r\nhowever, separates into different groups many plants which the student\r\nof the physiognomy of nature is compelled to associate together. Where\r\nvegetable forms occur in large masses, the outlines and distribution of\r\nthe leaves, and the form of the stems and branches lose their\r\nindividuality and become blended together. The painter—and here his\r\ndelicate artistical appreciation of nature comes especially into\r\nplay—distinguishes between pines or palms and beeches in the background\r\nof a landscape, but not between forests of beech and other thickly\r\nfoliated trees.\r\n\r\nThe physiognomy of nature is principally determined by sixteen forms of\r\nplants. I merely enumerate such as I have observed in my travels through\r\nthe old and new world during many years’ study of the vegetation of\r\ndifferent latitudes, between the parallels of 60° north and 12° south.\r\nThe number of these forms will no doubt be considerably increased by\r\ntravellers penetrating further into the interior of continents, and\r\ndiscovering new genera of plants. We are still wholly ignorant of the\r\nvegetation of the south-east of Asia, the interior of Africa and New\r\nHolland, and of South America from the Amazon to the province of\r\nChiquitos. Might not a region be some day discovered in which ligneous\r\nfungi, _Cenomyce rangiferina_, or mosses, form high trees? _Neckera\r\ndendroïdes_, a German species of moss, is in fact arborescent, and the\r\nsight of a wood of lofty mosses could hardly afford greater astonishment\r\nto its discoverers than that experienced by Europeans at the aspect of\r\narborescent grasses (bamboos) and the tree-ferns of the tropics, which\r\nare often equal in height to our lindens and alders. The maximum size\r\nand degree of development attainable by organic forms of any genus,\r\nwhether of animals or plants, are determined by laws with which we are\r\nstill unacquainted. In each of the great divisions of the animal\r\nkingdom, as insects, reptiles, crustacea, birds, fishes, or mammalia,\r\nthe dimensions of the body oscillate between certain extreme limits. But\r\nthese limits, based on the observations hitherto contributed to science,\r\nmay be enlarged by new discoveries of species with which we are at\r\npresent unacquainted.\r\n\r\nIn land animals a high degree of temperature, depending on latitude,\r\nappears to have exercised a favourable influence on the genetic\r\ndevelopment of organization. Thus the small and slender form of our\r\nlizards expands in the south into the colossal, unwieldy, and mail-clad\r\nbody of the formidable crocodile. In the huge cats of Africa and\r\nAmerica, the tiger, lion, and jaguar, we find, repeated on a larger\r\nscale, the form of one of the smallest of our domestic animals. But if\r\nwe penetrate into the recesses of the earth, and search the tombs of\r\nplants and animals, the fossil remains thus brought to light not only\r\nmanifest a distribution of forms at variance with the present climates,\r\nbut they also reveal colossal structures, which exhibit as marked a\r\ncontrast with the small types that now surround us, as does the simple\r\nyet dignified heroism of the ancient Greeks, when compared with what is\r\nrecognized at the present day as “greatness of character.” If the\r\ntemperature of the earth has undergone considerable, perhaps\r\nperiodically recurring changes, and, if even the relations between sea\r\nand land, and the height and pressure of the atmospheric ocean[84], have\r\nnot always been the same, then the physiognomy of nature, and the\r\nmagnitude and forms of organic bodies, must also have been subject to\r\nmany variations. Enormous Pachydermata, elephantine Mastodons, Owen’s\r\nMylodon robustus, and the Colossochelys,[JA] a land tortoise upwards of\r\nsix feet in height, once inhabited forests of colossal Lepidodendra,\r\ncactus-like Stigmariæ, and numerous genera of Cycadeæ. Unable accurately\r\nto delineate the physiognomy of our aging and altering planet according\r\nto its present features, I will only attempt to bring prominently\r\nforward those characteristics which specially appertain to each\r\nindividual group of plants. Notwithstanding all the richness and\r\nadaptability of our language, the attempt to designate in words, that\r\nwhich, in fact, appertains only to the imitative art of the painter, is\r\nalways fraught with difficulty. I would also wish to avoid that wearying\r\neffect which is almost unavoidably inseparable from a long enumeration\r\nof individual forms.\r\n\r\nWe will begin with Palms[85], the loftiest and most stately of all\r\nvegetable forms. To these, above all other trees, the prize of beauty\r\nhas always been awarded by every nation; and it was from the Asiatic\r\npalm-world, or the adjacent countries, that human civilization sent\r\nforth the first rays of its early dawn. Marked with rings, and not\r\nunfrequently armed with thorns, the tall and slender shaft of this\r\ngraceful tree rears on high its crown of shining, fan-like, or pinnated\r\nleaves, which are often curled like those of some gramineæ. Smooth stems\r\nof the palm, which I carefully measured, rose to a height of 190 feet.\r\nThe palm diminishes in size and beauty as it recedes from the equatorial\r\ntowards the temperate zones. Europe owns amongst its indigenous trees\r\nonly one representative of this form of vegetation, the dwarfish coast\r\npalm (_Chamæops_), which, in Spain and Italy, is found as far north as\r\n44° lat. The true palm climate has a mean annual temperature of 78° to\r\n81°.5 Fahr., but the date-palm, which has been brought to us from\r\nAfrica, and is less beautiful than other species of this family,\r\nvegetates in the south of Europe in districts whose mean temperature is\r\nonly from 59° to 62°.4 Fahr. Stems of palms and skeletons of elephants\r\nare found buried in the interior of the earth in Northern Europe; their\r\nposition renders it probable that they were not drifted from the tropics\r\ntowards the north, but that, in the great revolutions of our planet,\r\nclimates, and the physiognomy of nature which is regulated by climate,\r\nhave been, in many respects, altered.\r\n\r\nIn all regions of the earth the palm is found associated with the\r\nplantain or banana; the _Scitamineæ_ and _Musaceæ_ of botanists,\r\n_Heliconia_, _Amomum_, and _Strelitzia_. This form has a low, succulent,\r\nand almost herbaceous stem, the summit of which is crowned with\r\ndelicately striped, silky, shining leaves of a thin and loose texture.\r\nGroves of bananas form the ornament of humid regions; and on their fruit\r\nthe natives of the torrid zone chiefly depend for subsistence. Like the\r\nfarinaceous cereals or corn-yielding plants of the north, the banana has\r\naccompanied man from the earliest infancy of his civilization[86]. By\r\nsome Semitic traditions the primitive seat of these nutritious tropical\r\nplants has been placed on the shores of the Euphrates, and by others,\r\nwith greater probability, in India, at the foot of the Himalaya\r\nmountains. Greek legends cite the plains of Enna as the home of the\r\ncereals. Whilst, however, the cereals, spread by culture over the\r\nnorthern regions, in monotonous and far extending tracts, add but little\r\nto the beauty of the landscape; the inhabitant of the tropics, on the\r\nother hand, is enabled, by the propagation of the banana, to multiply\r\none of the noblest and most lovely of vegetable productions.\r\n\r\nThe form of the Malvaceæ[87] and Bombaceæ, represented by _Ceiba_,\r\n_Cavanillesia_, and the Mexican hand tree (_Cheirostemon_), has\r\nimmensely thick stems, with lanuginous, large, cordate, or indented\r\nleaves, and magnificent flowers, frequently of a purple-red. To this\r\ngroup belongs the Baobab, or monkey bread-tree, _Adansonia digitata_,\r\nwhich, with a moderate height, has occasionally a diameter of 32\r\nfeet,[JB] and may probably be regarded as at once the largest and most\r\nancient organic memorial of our planet. The Malvaceæ already begin to\r\nimpart to the vegetation of Italy a peculiarly southern character.\r\n\r\nThe temperate zone in our old continent unfortunately is wholly devoid\r\nof the delicately pinnate Mimosas[88], whose predominating forms are\r\n_Acacia_, _Desmanthus_, _Gleditschia_, _Porleria_, and _Tamarindus_.\r\nThis beautiful form occurs in the United States of North America, where,\r\nunder equal parallels of latitude, vegetation is more varied and\r\nluxuriant than in Europe. The Mimosas are generally characterised, like\r\nthe Italian pine, by an umbellate expansion of their branches. An\r\nextremely picturesque effect is produced by the deep blue of a tropical\r\nsky gleaming through the delicate tracery of their foliage.\r\n\r\nHeaths[89], which more especially belong to an African group of plants,\r\ninclude, according to physiognomic character and general appearance, the\r\nEpacrideæ and Diosmeæ, many Proteaceæ, and the Australian Acacias, which\r\nhave no leaves but mere flattened petioles (phyllodia). This group bears\r\nsome resemblance to acicular-leaved forms, with which it contrasts the\r\nmore gracefully by the abundance of its campanulate blossoms. The\r\narborescent heaths, like some few other African plants, extend as far as\r\nthe northern shores of the Mediterranean. They adorn the plains of\r\nItaly, and the Cistus groves of southern Spain, but I have nowhere seen\r\nthem growing more luxuriantly than on the declivities of the Peak of\r\nTeyde at Teneriffe. In the countries bordering on the Baltic, and\r\nfurther northward, the appearance of this form of plants is regarded\r\nwith apprehension, as the precursor of drought and barrenness. Our\r\nheaths, _Erica (Calluna) vulgaris_, and _Erica tetralix_, _E. carnea_\r\nand _E. cinerea_, are social plants, against whose extension\r\nagricultural nations have contended for centuries, with but little\r\nsuccess. It is singular that the principal representative of this family\r\nshould be peculiar to one side of our planet alone. There is only one of\r\nthe three hundred known species of _Erica_ to be met with in the new\r\ncontinent, from Pennsylvania and Labrador to Nootka Sound and Alaschka.\r\n\r\nThe _Cactus_ form[90], on the other hand, is almost peculiar to the new\r\ncontinent; it is sometimes globular, sometimes articulated, sometimes\r\nrising in tall polygonal columns not unlike organ-pipes. This group\r\nforms the most striking contrast with the Lily and Banana families, and\r\nbelongs to that class of plants which Bernardin de St. Pierre\r\nfelicitously terms vegetable fountains of the Desert. In the parched\r\narid plains of South America, the thirsting animals eagerly seek the\r\n_Melon-cactus_, a globular plant half-buried in the dry sand, whose\r\nsucculent interior is concealed by formidable prickles. The stems of the\r\ncolumnar cactus attain a height of more than 30 feet; their\r\ncandelabra-like ramifications, frequently covered with lichens,\r\nreminding the traveller, by some analogy in their physiognomy, of\r\ncertain of the African Euphorbias.\r\n\r\nWhile these plants form green Oases in the barren desert, the\r\nOrchideæ[91] shed beauty over the most desolate rocky clefts, and the\r\nseared and blackened stems of those tropical trees which have been\r\ndiscoloured by the action of light. The _Vanilla_ form is distinguished\r\nby its light green succulent leaves, and by its variegated and\r\nsingularly shaped blossoms. Some of the orchideous flowers resemble in\r\nshape winged insects, while others look like birds, attracted by the\r\nfragrance of the honey vessels. An entire life would not suffice to\r\nenable an artist, although limiting himself to the specimens afforded by\r\none circumscribed region, to depict the splendid Orchideæ which\r\nembellish the deep alpine valleys of the Peruvian Andes.\r\n\r\nThe form of the Casuarineæ[92], leafless, like almost all the species of\r\nCactus, comprises a group of trees having branches resembling the\r\nEquisetum, and is peculiar to the islands of the Pacific and to the East\r\nIndies. Traces of this type, which is certainly more singular than\r\nbeautiful, may however be found in other regions of the earth. Plumier’s\r\n_Equisetum altissimum_, Forskäl’s _Ephedra aphylla_ of North Africa, the\r\nPeruvian _Colletia_, and the Siberian _Calligonum Pallasia_, are nearly\r\nallied to the form of the Casuarinas.\r\n\r\nWhile the Banana form presents us with the greatest degree of expansion,\r\nthe Casuarinas and the acicular-leaved[93] trees exhibit the greatest\r\ncontraction of the leaf-vessels. Pines, Thujas, and Cypresses constitute\r\na northern form but rarely met with in the tropics and in some coniferæ\r\n(_Dammara Salisburia_), the leaves are both broad and acicular. Their\r\nevergreen foliage enlivens the gloom of the dreary winter landscape,\r\nwhile it proclaims to the natives of the polar regions that, although\r\nsnow and ice cover the surface, the inner life of plants, like the\r\nPromethean fire, is never wholly extinct on our planet.\r\n\r\nBesides the Orchideæ, the Pothos tribe of plants[94] also yields a\r\ngraceful covering to the aged stems of forest trees in the tropical\r\nworld, like the parasitic mosses and lichens of our own climes. Their\r\nsucculent herbaceous stalks are furnished with large leaves,\r\narrow-shaped, digitate, or elongated, and invariably furnished with\r\nthick veins. The blossoms of the Aroideæ are inclosed in spathes, by\r\nwhich their vital heat is increased; they are stemless, and send forth\r\naërial roots. Pothos, Dracontium, Caladium, and Arum are all kindred\r\nforms; and the last-named extends as far as the coasts of the\r\nMediterranean, contributing, together with succulent Tussilago\r\n(Coltsfoot), high thistles, and the Acanthus, to give a luxuriant\r\nsouthern character to the vegetation of Spain and Italy.\r\n\r\nThis Arum form is associated, in the torrid regions of South America,\r\nwith the tropical _Lianes_ or creeping plants[95], which exhibit the\r\nutmost luxuriance of vegetation in Paullinias, Banisterias, Bignonias,\r\nand Passion-flowers. Our tendrilled hops and vines remind us of this\r\ntropical form. On the Orinoco the leafless branches of the Bauhinia are\r\noften upwards of 40 feet in length, sometimes hanging perpendicularly\r\nfrom the summit of lofty Swieteniæ, (Mahogany trees), sometimes\r\nstretched obliquely like ropes from a mast; along these the tiger-cat\r\nmay be seen climbing to and fro with wonderful agility.\r\n\r\nThe self-sustaining form of the bluish-flowered Aloe tribe[96] presents\r\na marked contrast to the pliant climbing lianes with their fresh and\r\nbrilliant verdure. When there is a stem it is almost branchless, closely\r\nmarked with spiral rings, and surrounded by a crown of succulent,\r\nfleshy, long-pointed leaves, which radiate from a centre. The\r\nlofty-stemmed aloe does not grow in clusters like other social plants,\r\nbut stands isolated in the midst of dreary solitudes, imparting to the\r\ntropical landscape a peculiar melancholy (one might almost say African)\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nTo this aloe form belong, in reference to physiognomic resemblance and\r\nthe impression they produce on the landscape: the Pitcairnias, from the\r\nfamily of the Bromeliaceæ, which in the chain of the Andes grow out of\r\nclefts in the rock; the great _Pournetia pyramidata_ (the _Atschupalla_\r\nof the elevated plateaux of New Grenada); the American aloe (Agave),\r\n_Bromelia Ananas_ and _B. Karatas_; those rare species of the family of\r\nthe Euphorbiaceæ, which have thick, short, candelabra-like divided\r\nstems; the African aloe, and the Dragon tree, _Dracæna Draco_, of the\r\nfamily of the Asphodeleæ; and lastly the tall flowering Yucca, allied to\r\nthe Liliaceæ.\r\n\r\nWhile the Aloe form is characterised by an air of solemn repose and\r\nimmobility, the grass form[97], especially as regards the physiognomy of\r\nthe arborescent grasses, is expressive of buoyant lightness and flexible\r\nslenderness. In both the Indies, bamboo groves form arched and shady\r\nwalks.\r\n\r\nThe smooth and often inclined and waving stem of the tropical grasses\r\nexceeds in height our alders and oaks. As far north as Italy, this form\r\nalready begins, in the _Arundo Donax_, to raise itself from the ground,\r\nand to determine, by height as well as mass, the natural character of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe form of Ferns[98], like that of grasses, also assumes nobler\r\ndimensions in the torrid regions of the earth, and the arborescent\r\nferns, which frequently attain the height of above forty feet, have a\r\npalm-like appearance, although their stem is thicker, shorter, and more\r\nrough and scaly, than that of the palm. The leaf is more delicate, of a\r\nloose and more transparent texture, and sharply serrated on the margins.\r\nThese colossal ferns belong almost exclusively to the tropics, but there\r\nthey prefer the temperate localities. As in these latitudes diminution\r\nof heat is merely the consequence of an increase of elevation, we may\r\nregard mountains that rise 2000 or 3000 feet above the level of the sea\r\nas the principal seat of these plants. Arborescent ferns grow in South\r\nAmerica, side by side with that beneficent tree whose stem yields the\r\nfebrifuge bark, and both forms of vegetation are indicative of the happy\r\nregion where reigns the genial mildness of perpetual spring.\r\n\r\nI have now to mention the form of the Liliaceous plants[99],\r\n_Amaryllis_, _Ixia_, _Gladiolus_, and _Pancratium_, with their flag-like\r\nleaves and splendid blossoms, the principal home of which is Southern\r\nAfrica; also the Willow form[100], which is indigenous in all latitudes,\r\nand is represented in the plateaux of Quito, not by the shape of its\r\nleaves, but in the form of its ramification, in Schinus Molle; also the\r\nMyrtle-form[101] (_Metrosideros_, _Eucalyptus_, _Escallonia\r\nmyrtelloides_); Melastomaceæ[102]; and the Laurel form[103].\r\n\r\nIt would be an undertaking worthy of a great artist to study the\r\ncharacter of all these vegetable groups, not in hothouses, or from the\r\ndescriptions of botanists, but on the grand theatre of tropical nature.\r\nHow interesting and instructive to the landscape painter[104] would be a\r\nwork that should present to the eye accurate delineations of the sixteen\r\nprincipal forms enumerated, both individually and in collective\r\ncontrast! What can be more picturesque than the arborescent Ferns, which\r\nspread their tender foliage above the Mexican laureloak! what more\r\ncharming than the aspect of banana-groves, shaded by those lofty\r\ngrasses, the Guadua and Bamboo! It is peculiarly the privilege of the\r\nartist to separate these into groups, and thus the beautiful images of\r\nnature, if we may be permitted the simile, resolve themselves beneath\r\nhis touch, like the written works of man, into a few simple elements.\r\n\r\nIt is beneath the glowing rays of a tropical sun, that the noblest forms\r\nof vegetation are developed. In the cold North the bark of trees is\r\ncovered only with dry lichens and mosses, while beneath the tropics the\r\nCymbidium and the fragrant Vanilla adorn the trunks of the Anacardias\r\nand the gigantic Fig-tree. The fresh green of the Pothos leaves and of\r\nthe Dracontias contrast with the many coloured blossoms of the Orchideæ;\r\nclimbing Bauhinias, Passion-flowers and golden flowered Banisterias\r\nencircle every tree of the forest. Delicate blossoms unfold themselves\r\nfrom the roots of the _Theobroma_, and from the thick and rough bark of\r\nthe _Crescentia_ and _Gustavia_[105]. Amid this luxuriant abundance of\r\nflowers and foliage, amid this exuberance and tangled web of creeping\r\nplants, it is often difficult for the naturalist to recognise the stems\r\nto which the various leaves and blossoms belong. A single tree, adorned\r\nwith Paullinias, Bignonias, and Dendrobias, forms a group of plants,\r\nwhich, separated from each other, would cover a considerable space of\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIn the tropics, plants are more succulent, of a fresher green, and have\r\nlarger and more glossy leaves, than in the northern regions. Social\r\nplants, which give such a character of uniformity to European\r\nvegetation, are almost wholly absent in the equatorial zone. Trees,\r\nalmost twice as high as our oaks, there bloom with flowers as large and\r\nsplendid as our lilies. On the shady banks of the Magdalena River, in\r\nSouth America, grows a climbing _Aristolochia_, whose blossoms,\r\nmeasuring four feet in circumference, the Indian children sportively\r\ndraw on their heads as caps[106]. In the South Indian Archipelago, the\r\nflower of the Rafflesia is nearly three feet in diameter, and weighs\r\nabove fourteen pounds.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary height to which not only individual mountains but even\r\nwhole districts rise in tropical regions, and the consequent cold of\r\nsuch elevations, affords the inhabitant of the tropics a singular\r\nspectacle. For besides his own palms and bananas, he is surrounded by\r\nthose vegetable forms which would seem to belong solely to northern\r\nlatitudes. Cypresses, pines, and oaks, barberry shrubs and alders\r\n(nearly allied to our own species) cover the mountain plains of Southern\r\nMexico and the chain of the Andes at the equator. Thus nature has\r\npermitted the native of the torrid zone to behold all the vegetable\r\nforms of the earth without quitting his own clime, even as are revealed\r\nto him the luminous worlds which spangle the firmament from pole to\r\npole[107].\r\n\r\nThese and many other of the enjoyments which nature affords are denied\r\nto the nations of the North. Many constellations and many vegetable\r\nforms, including more especially the most beautiful productions of the\r\nearth (palms, tree-ferns, bananas, arborescent grasses, and delicately\r\nfeathered mimosas), remain for ever unknown to them; for the puny plants\r\npent up in our hothouses, give but a faint idea of the majestic\r\nvegetation of the tropics. But the rich development of our language, the\r\nglowing fancy of the poet, and the imitative art of the painter, afford\r\nus abundant compensation; and enable the imagination to depict in vivid\r\ncolours the images of an exotic Nature. In the frigid North, amid barren\r\nheaths, the solitary student may appropriate all that has been\r\ndiscovered in the most remote regions of the earth, and thus create\r\nwithin himself a world as free and imperishable as the spirit from which\r\nit emanates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ILLUSTRATIONS AND ADDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  p. 210—“_On the Chimborazo, upwards of eight thousand feet higher than\r\n  Etna_.”\r\n\r\n  Small singing birds, and even butterflies, (as I have myself witnessed\r\n  in the Pacific,) are often met with at great distances from the shore,\r\n  during storms blowing off land. In a similar manner insects are\r\n  involuntarily carried into the higher regions of the atmosphere, to an\r\n  elevation of 17,000 to 19,000 feet above the plains. The light bodies\r\n  of these insects are borne upwards by the vertically ascending\r\n  currents of air caused by the heated condition of the earth’s surface.\r\n  M. Boussingault, an admirable chemist, who ascended the Gneiss\r\n  Mountains of Caracas, while holding the appointment of Professor in\r\n  the newly established Mining Academy at Santa Fé de Bogotá, witnessed,\r\n  during his ascent to the summit of the Silla, a phenomenon which\r\n  confirmed in a most remarkable manner this vertical ascent of air. He\r\n  and his companion, Don Mariano de Rivero, observed at noon a number of\r\n  luminous whitish bodies rise from the valley of Caracas to the summit\r\n  of the Silla, an elevation of 5755 feet, and then sink towards the\r\n  adjacent sea coast. This phenomenon was uninterruptedly prolonged for\r\n  a whole hour, when it was discovered that the bodies, at first\r\n  mistaken for a flock of small birds, were a number of minute balls of\r\n  grass-haums. Boussingault sent me some of this grass, which was\r\n  immediately recognised by Professor Kunth as a species of Vilfa, a\r\n  genus of grass which together with Agrostis is of frequent occurrence\r\n  in the provinces of Caracas and Cumana. It was the _Vilfa tenacissima_\r\n  of our _Synopsis Plantarum æquinoctialium Orbis Novi_, t. i. p. 205.\r\n  Saussure found butterflies on Mont Blanc, and Ramond observed them in\r\n  the solitudes around the summit of Mont Perdu. When MM. Bonpland,\r\n  Carlos Montufar, and myself, on the 23rd of June, 1802, ascended the\r\n  eastern declivity of Mount Chimborazo, to a height of 19,286 feet, and\r\n  where the barometer had fallen to 14·84 inches, we found winged\r\n  insects buzzing around us. We recognised them to be Diptera,\r\n  resembling flies, but it was impossible to catch these insects\r\n  standing on the rocky ledges (_cuchilla_), often less than a foot in\r\n  breadth, and between masses of snow precipitated from above. The\r\n  elevation at which we observed these insects was almost the same as\r\n  that in which the naked trachytic rock, which projected from the\r\n  eternal snows around, exhibited the last traces of vegetation in\r\n  Lecidea geographica. These insects were flying at an elevation of\r\n  18,225 feet, or nearly 2660 feet higher than the summit of Mont Blanc:\r\n  and somewhat below this height, at an elevation of 16,626 feet, and\r\n  therefore also above the region of snow, M. Bonpland saw yellow\r\n  butterflies flying close to the ground. The mammalia which live\r\n  nearest to the region of perpetual snow, are, in the Swiss Alps, the\r\n  hybernating marmot, and a very small field-mouse, (Hypudæus nivalis,)\r\n  described by Martius, which on the Faulhorn lays up, almost under the\r\n  snow, a store of the roots of phanerogamic alpine plants.[JC] The\r\n  opinion prevalent in Europe, that the beautiful rodent, the\r\n  Chinchilla, whose soft and glossy fur is so much esteemed, is found in\r\n  the highest mountain regions of Chili, is an error. The Chinchilla\r\n  laniger (Gray) lives only in a mild lower zone, and does not advance\r\n  further south than the parallel of 35°.[JD]\r\n\r\n  Whilst among our European Alps, Lecideas, Parmelias, and Umbilicarias\r\n  but scantily clothe with a few coloured patches those rocks that are\r\n  not wholly covered with snow, we found in the Andes, at elevations of\r\n  13,700 to nearly 15,000 feet, some phanerogamic plants which we were\r\n  the first to describe; as for instance, the woolly species of\r\n  Fraylejon. (Culcitium nivale, C. rufescens, and C. reflexum, Espeletia\r\n  grandiflora, and E. argentea), Sida pichinchensis, Ranunculus\r\n  nubigenus, R. Gusmanni with red or orange-coloured flowers, the small\r\n  moss-like umbelliferous plant, Myrrhis andicola, and Fragosa\r\n  arctioides. On the declivity of the Chimborazo, the Saxifraga\r\n  Boussingaulti, described by Adolph Brongniart, grows beyond the limits\r\n  of perpetual snow on loose blocks of stone at an elevation of 15,770\r\n  feet above the level of the sea, and not at 17,000 as has been stated\r\n  in two admirable English journals.[JE] This Saxifrage, discovered by\r\n  Boussingault, must therefore be regarded as the highest growing\r\n  phanerogamic plant in the world.\r\n\r\n  The vertical height of Chimborazo is, according to my measurement,\r\n  21,422 feet.[JF] This result is a mean between those which have been\r\n  given by the French and Spanish Academicians. The principal\r\n  differences do not here depend on different assumptions for the\r\n  refraction, but on a difference in reducing the measured line to the\r\n  level of the sea. This reduction can only be made in the Andes by the\r\n  barometer, and hence every so-called trigonometric measurement must\r\n  also necessarily be a barometric one, whose result will vary according\r\n  to the different formulæ employed. Owing to the enormous mass of the\r\n  mountain chain, we can only obtain very small angles of altitude, when\r\n  the greater portion of the whole height has to be measured\r\n  trigonometrically, and the observation is made at some low and distant\r\n  point near the plain or the level of the sea. It is on the other hand\r\n  extremely difficult to obtain a convenient base line, as the space\r\n  that is to be determined barometrically increases with every step we\r\n  advance towards the mountain. These obstacles have to be encountered\r\n  by every traveller who on the high table-lands, which surround the\r\n  summit of the Andes, selects a spot for performing a geodetic\r\n  operation. On the pumice-covered plain of Tapia, to the west of the\r\n  Rio Chambo, at a height of 9477 feet, barometrically determined, I\r\n  measured the Chimborazo. The Llanos de Luisa, and more especially the\r\n  plain of Sisgun, whose elevation is 12,150 feet, would yield greater\r\n  angles of altitude. I had on one occasion made every preparation\r\n  necessary for the measurement of Mount Chimborazo, from the plain of\r\n  Sisgun, when the summit of the mountain was suddenly shrouded in a\r\n  dense cloud.\r\n\r\n  Some hypothetical suggestions, regarding the probable derivation of\r\n  the name of the far-famed “Chimborazo,” may not be wholly unwelcome to\r\n  etymologists. The district in which the mountain is situated is called\r\n  Chimbo, a word which La Condamine[JG] derives from _chimpani_, to\r\n  cross a river. “Chimboraço” means, according to him, “the snow of the\r\n  opposite bank,” from the fact of a brook being crossed at the village\r\n  of Chimbo, in sight of the huge snow-covered mountain. (In the Quichua\r\n  language _chimpa_ signifies the opposite bank or side; _chimpani_ to\r\n  cross a river, bridge, &c.) Several natives of the province of Quito\r\n  assured me that Chimborazo meant simply the snow of Chimbo. In\r\n  Carguairazo we meet with the same termination, and it would appear\r\n  that “razo” is a provincial word. The Jesuit Holguin, whose excellent\r\n  vocabulary[JH] I possess, is not acquainted with the word razo. The\r\n  genuine term for snow is ritti. On the other hand, my friend,\r\n  Professor Buschmann, an admirable linguist, remarks that in the\r\n  Chinchaysuyo dialect, (employed north of Cuzco as far as Quito and\r\n  Pasto) raju, the _j_ being apparently guttural, signifies snow.[JI] As\r\n  chimpa and chimpani do not well suit on account of the _a_, we may\r\n  seek a definite meaning for the first portion of the name of the\r\n  mountain and of the village Chimbo, in the Quichua word “chimpu,”\r\n  which is used to express a coloured thread or fringe (señal de lana,\r\n  hilo ó borlilla de colores); the redness of the sky (arreboles), and\r\n  the halo round the sun and moon. The name of the mountain might be\r\n  thus derived from this word, without reference to the district or\r\n  village. At all events, whatever may be the etymology of the word\r\n  Chimborazo, it should be written in the Peruvian manner Chimporazo, as\r\n  the Peruvians have no _b_ in their alphabet.\r\n\r\n  May not the name of this colossal mountain be wholly independent of\r\n  the Inca language, and have come down from a bygone age? The Inca or\r\n  Quichua language had not been introduced long prior to the Spanish\r\n  invasion into the kingdom of Quito, where the now wholly extinct\r\n  Puruay language had been previously used. The names of other\r\n  mountains, as Pichincha, Ilinissa, and Cotopaxi, are wholly devoid of\r\n  meaning in the language of the Incas, and are therefore undoubtedly of\r\n  higher antiquity than the introduction of the worship of the sun, and\r\n  of the court-language of the rulers of Cuzco. The names of mountains\r\n  and rivers belong in all regions of the earth to the most ancient and\r\n  authentic relics of languages; and my brother, Wilhelm von Humboldt,\r\n  in his investigations into the former distribution of the Iberian\r\n  races, has made ingenious use of these names. A singular and\r\n  unexpected statement has recently been made,[JJ] “that the Incas,\r\n  Tupac Yupanqui, and Huayna Capac, were astonished on their first\r\n  conquest of Quito, to find a dialect of their Quichua language in use\r\n  among the natives.” Prescott, however, seems to regard this as a very\r\n  bold assertion.[JK]\r\n\r\n  If we could suppose the pass of St. Gothard, Mount Athos, or the Rigi,\r\n  piled on the summit of the Chimborazo, we should have the elevation\r\n  which is at present ascribed to the Dhawalagiri in the Himalaya. The\r\n  geologist who regards the interior of our planet from a more general\r\n  point of view, and to whom not the directions, but the relative\r\n  heights of the rocky projections, which we designate mountain chains,\r\n  appear but as phenomena of little importance, will not be astonished\r\n  if at some future period mountain summits should be discovered between\r\n  the Himalaya and the Altai, which should surpass in height those of\r\n  Dhawalagiri and Djawahir as much as these exceed that of\r\n  Chimborazo.[JL] The great height to which the snow-line recedes _in\r\n  summer_ on the northern declivity of the Himalaya, owing to the heat\r\n  radiated from the elevated plateaux in Central Asia, renders the\r\n  mountain, notwithstanding that it is situated in 29 to 30½° north\r\n  lat., as accessible as are the Peruvian Andes in the region of the\r\n  tropics. Captain Gerard has moreover recently ascended the Tarhigang\r\n  as high, if not 117 feet higher,[JM] than I ascended the Chimborazo.\r\n  Unfortunately, as I have elsewhere more fully shown, these mountain\r\n  ascents, beyond the line of perpetual snow, however they may engage\r\n  the curiosity of the public, are of very little scientific utility.\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  p. 210—“_The Condor, that giant among vultures_.”\r\n\r\n  I have elsewhere[JN] given the natural history of the Condor, which\r\n  before my travels had been variously misstated. The name is properly\r\n  _Cuntur_ in the Inca language; _Mañque_ among the Araucanes in Chili;\r\n  _Sarcoramphus Condor_ according to Duméril. I sketched the head of\r\n  this bird from life, of the natural size, and had my drawing engraved.\r\n  Next to the Condor, the Lämmergeier of Switzerland, and the _Falco\r\n  destructor_ (Daud.), probably Linnæus’ _Falco Harpyia_, are the\r\n  largest of all _flying_ birds.\r\n\r\n  The region which may be regarded as the common resort of the Condor,\r\n  begins at the elevation of Mount Etna. It embraces atmospheric strata\r\n  which are from 10,000 to 19,000 feet above the level of the sea.\r\n  Humming birds also, which in their summer flights advance as far as\r\n  61° north lat. on the western coast of America, and are on the other\r\n  hand found in the Archipelago of the Tierra del Fuego, were seen by\r\n  Von Tschudi in Puna at an elevation of 14,600 feet.[JO] There is a\r\n  pleasure in comparing the largest and the smallest of the feathered\r\n  inhabitants of the air. The largest among the Condors found in the\r\n  Cordilleras, near Quito, measure nearly 15 feet across the expanded\r\n  wings, and the smaller ones 8½ feet. This size, and the visual angle\r\n  at which the birds are seen vertically above one’s head, afford an\r\n  idea of the enormous height to which the Condor soars in a clear sky.\r\n  A visual angle of four minutes, for instance, would give a vertical\r\n  elevation of 7330 feet. The cavern (Mackay) of Antisana, opposite the\r\n  mountain of Chussulongo, and where we measured the birds soaring over\r\n  the chain of the Andes, lies at an elevation of nearly 16,000 feet\r\n  above the surface of the Pacific; the absolute height which the Condor\r\n  reached must therefore be 23,273 feet, a height at which the barometer\r\n  scarcely stands at 12·7 inches; but which, however, does not exceed\r\n  that of the loftiest summit of the Himalaya. It is a remarkable\r\n  physiological phenomenon that the same bird, which wheels for hours\r\n  together through these highly rarefied regions, should be able\r\n  suddenly, as for instance on the western declivity of the volcano of\r\n  Pichincha, to descend to the sea-shore, and thus in the course of a\r\n  few hours traverse, as it were, all climates. At heights of 23,000\r\n  feet and upwards the membranous air-sacs of the Condor must undergo a\r\n  remarkable degree of inflation after being filled in lower regions of\r\n  the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n  Ulloa, more than a hundred years ago, expressed his astonishment that\r\n  the Vulture of the Andes could soar at heights where the pressure of\r\n  the atmosphere was less than fifteen inches.[JP] An opinion was at\r\n  that time entertained, from the analogy of experiments made with the\r\n  air-pump, that no animal could exist under this slight amount of\r\n  atmospheric pressure. I have myself, as has already been mentioned,\r\n  seen the barometer fall to 14·85 inches on the Chimborazo; and my\r\n  friend, M. Gay-Lussac, breathed for a quarter of an hour an atmosphere\r\n  in which the pressure was only 12·9 inches. It must be admitted that\r\n  man, when wearied by muscular exertion, finds himself in a state of\r\n  painful exhaustion at such elevations; but in the Condor, the\r\n  respiratory process seems to be performed with equal facility under a\r\n  pressure of 30 or of 13 inches. This bird probably raises itself\r\n  _voluntarily_ to a greater height from the surface of our earth than\r\n  any other living creature. I use the expression “voluntarily,” since\r\n  small insects and siliceous-shelled infusoria are frequently borne to\r\n  greater elevations by a rising current of air. It is probable that the\r\n  Condor flies even higher than the above calculations would appear to\r\n  show. I remember observing near the Cotopaxi, in the pumice plain of\r\n  Suniguaicu, at an elevation of 14,471 feet above the level of the sea,\r\n  this bird soaring at such a height above my head that it appeared like\r\n  a black speck. But what is the smallest angle under which faintly\r\n  illumined objects can be distinguished? Their form (linear extension)\r\n  exercises a great influence on the minimum of this angle. The\r\n  transparency of the mountain air is so great under the equator, that\r\n  in the province of Quito, as I have elsewhere stated, the white cloak\r\n  (_poncho_) of a horseman may be distinguished with the naked eye at a\r\n  horizontal distance of 89,664 feet, and therefore under an angle of\r\n  thirteen seconds. It was my friend Bonpland whom we observed, from the\r\n  pleasant country-seat of the Marques de Selvalegre, moving along a\r\n  black rocky precipice on the volcano of Pichincha. Lightning\r\n  conductors, being thin elongated objects, are visible, as Arago has\r\n  observed, from the greatest distances and under the smallest angles.\r\n\r\n  The account I have given in my Monograph of the Condor (_Zoologie_,\r\n  pp. 26–45) of the habits of this powerful bird in the mountain\r\n  districts of Quito and Peru has been confirmed by a more recent\r\n  traveller, Gay, who has explored the whole of Chili, and described it\r\n  in his admirable work, _Historia fisica y politica de Chile_. This\r\n  bird which, singularly enough, like the Lamas, Vicuñas, Alpacas and\r\n  Guanacos, is not found beyond the equator in New Granada, penetrates\r\n  as far south as the Straits of Magellan. In Chili, as in the elevated\r\n  plateaux of Quito, the Condors, which usually live in pairs, or even\r\n  alone, congregate in flocks for the purpose of attacking lambs and\r\n  calves, or seizing on young Guanacos (Guanacillos). The havoc annually\r\n  committed by the Condor among the herds of sheep, goats and cattle, as\r\n  well as among the wild vicuñas, alpacas and guanacos of the chain of\r\n  the Andes is very considerable. The Chilians assert that this bird\r\n  when in captivity can endure hunger for forty days; when in a free\r\n  state, however, its voracity is excessive, and it then, like the\r\n  vulture, feeds by preference on carrion.\r\n\r\n  The mode of catching these birds, by an inclosure of palisades such as\r\n  I have already described, is as successful in Chili as in Peru, for\r\n  the bird after being rendered heavy from excess of food is obliged to\r\n  run a short distance with half-extended wings before it can take\r\n  flight. A dead ox which is already in an incipient state of\r\n  decomposition, is strongly inclosed with palisades, within which\r\n  narrow space the Condors throng together; being unable, as already\r\n  observed, to fly on account of the excess of food which they have\r\n  devoured, and impeded in their run by the palisades, these birds are\r\n  either killed by the natives with clubs, or are caught alive by the\r\n  lasso. The Condor was represented as a symbol of strength on the\r\n  coinage of Chili immediately after the first declaration of political\r\n  independence.[JQ]\r\n\r\n  The different species of Gallinazos, which are much more considerable\r\n  in point of numbers than the Condors, are also far more useful than\r\n  the latter in the great economy of Nature for destroying and removing\r\n  animal substances that are becoming decomposed, and thus purifying the\r\n  atmosphere in the neighbourhood of human dwellings. In tropical\r\n  America, I have sometimes seen seventy or eighty of these creatures\r\n  collected round a dead ox; and I am able, as an eye-witness, to\r\n  confirm the fact that has of late erroneously been called in question\r\n  by ornithologists, that the appearance of one single king-vulture (who\r\n  is not larger than the Gallinazos) is sufficient to put a whole\r\n  assemblage of these birds to flight. No contest ever takes place; but\r\n  the Gallinazos (two species of which, (Cathartes urubu and C. aura,)\r\n  have been confounded together by an unfortunately fluctuating\r\n  nomenclature) are intimidated by the sudden appearance and the\r\n  courageous demeanour of the richly coloured “_Sarcoramphus Papa_.” As\r\n  the ancient Egyptians protected the Percnopteri, which purified the\r\n  atmosphere, so also the wanton destruction of Gallinazos is punished\r\n  in Peru by a fine (_multa_) which, according to Gay, amounts in some\r\n  cities to 300 piastres for every bird. It is a remarkable fact, that\r\n  this species of vulture, as was already testified by Don Felix de\r\n  Azara, if trained early, will so accustom themselves to the person who\r\n  has reared them, that they will follow him on a journey for many\r\n  miles, flying after his carriage across the Pampa.\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  p. 211—“_Encloses their rotating bodies_.”\r\n\r\n  Fontana, in his admirable treatise “on the poison of the viper,” vol.\r\n  i. p. 62, mentions that he succeeded in restoring to animation, after\r\n  two hours’ immersion in a drop of water, a wheel-animalcule which had\r\n  lain in a dried and motionless condition for the space of two years\r\n  and a half.[JR]\r\n\r\n  The so-called reanimation of Rotifera has very recently again been\r\n  made a subject of lively discussion, since observations have been\r\n  conducted with more exactness and subjected to a stricter criticism.\r\n  Baker affirmed that in 1771, he had revived paste-eels which Needham\r\n  had given him in the year 1744! Franz Bauer saw his _Vibrio tritici_,\r\n  which had lain four years in a dry state, move on being moistened. The\r\n  remarkably careful and experienced observer, Doyère,[JS] draws the\r\n  following conclusions from his beautiful experiments: that Rotifera\r\n  revive, i.e. pass from a motionless state to one of motion, after\r\n  being exposed to a cold of 11°.2 Fahr., or to a heat of 113° Fahr.;\r\n  that they preserve the property of reviving in dry sand up to a\r\n  temperature of 159° Fahr.; but that they lose this property and remain\r\n  immoveable if warmed in _moist sand_ to 131° Fahr. only;[JT] and that\r\n  the possibility of this so-called revivification is not prevented by\r\n  their being exposed to desiccation for twenty-eight days in barometric\r\n  tubes, in vacuo, even should chloride of lime or sulphuric acid be\r\n  employed.[JU]\r\n\r\n  Doyère has also seen Rotifera slowly revive after being dried without\r\n  sand, (desséchés à nu,) a fact which Spallanzani denies.[JV]\r\n  “Desiccation conducted in an ordinary temperature might be open to\r\n  many objections which are not perhaps wholly obviated by the\r\n  employment of a dry vacuum; but when we observe that the _Tardigrades_\r\n  irrevocably perish in a temperature of 131° Fahr. if their tissues are\r\n  permeated with water, whereas they can, when dried, support a\r\n  temperature that may be estimated at 248° Fahr., we are disposed to\r\n  admit that the sole condition required for _animal_ revivification is\r\n  the perfect integrity of organic structure and continuity.”\r\n\r\n  In like manner, the sporules, or germinating cells of cryptogamic\r\n  plants, which Kunth compares to the propagation of certain\r\n  phanerogamic plants by buds (bulbillæ), retain their power of\r\n  germination in the highest temperature. According to the most recent\r\n  experiments of Payen, the sporules of a small fungus (Oïdium\r\n  aurantiacum), which invests the crumb of bread with a reddish feathery\r\n  coating, do not even lose their vegetative powers by being exposed in\r\n  closed tubes for half an hour to a temperature of 183° to 208° Fahr.\r\n  before being strewn on fresh, unspoilt dough. May not the newly\r\n  discovered and wonderful monad (Monas prodigiosa), which causes\r\n  blood-like spots in mealy substances, have been mixed with this\r\n  fungus?\r\n\r\n  Ehrenberg, in his great work on Infusoria (p. 492–496), has given the\r\n  most complete history of all the observations instituted on the\r\n  so-called revivification of Rotifera. He believes, that\r\n  notwithstanding all the means of desiccation employed, the\r\n  organization-fluid still remains in the apparently dead animal. He\r\n  contests the hypothesis of “latent life”; for death, he says, “is not\r\n  life in a torpid state, but the absence of life.”\r\n\r\n  The hybernation or winter-sleep of both warm and coldblooded animals,\r\n  as dormice, marmots, sand-martins (_Hirundo riparia_, according to\r\n  Cuvier)[JW], and of frogs and toads, affords us evidence of the\r\n  diminution, if not of the complete suspension, of the organic\r\n  functions. Frogs awakened from their winter-sleep by warmth, can\r\n  remain eight times longer under water, without drowning, than frogs in\r\n  the breeding season. It seems as if the respiratory functions of the\r\n  lungs require a less degree of activity after the long suspension of\r\n  their excitability. The circumstance of the sand-martin burying itself\r\n  during the winter in marshes, is a phenomenon which, while it scarcely\r\n  admits of a doubt, is the more remarkable, because in birds, the\r\n  function of respiration is so extremely energetic, that, according to\r\n  Lavoisier’s experiments, two sparrows in an ordinary condition will,\r\n  in the same time, decompose as much atmospheric air as a\r\n  Guinea-pig.[JX] Winter-sleep is not supposed to be general to the\r\n  whole species of these sand-martins, but only to some few\r\n  individuals.[JY]\r\n\r\n  As in the frigid zone deprivation of warmth produces winter-sleep in\r\n  some animals, so in the torrid regions, within the tropics, an\r\n  analogous phenomenon is manifested that has not hitherto been\r\n  sufficiently regarded, and to which I have applied the term\r\n  _summer-sleep_.[JZ] Drought and a continuous high temperature act like\r\n  the cold of winter in reducing excitability. Madagascar, excepting a\r\n  very small portion of its southern extremity, lies within the tropics,\r\n  and here, as was already observed by Bruguière, the hedgehog-like\r\n  Tenrecs (_Centeres_, Illiger), one species of which (_C. ecaudatus_)\r\n  was introduced into the Isle of France (20° 9′, latitude), sleep\r\n  during excessive heat. The objection advanced by Desjardins, that the\r\n  time of their sleep falls within the season of winter in the southern\r\n  hemisphere, can scarcely be regarded as applicable in reference to a\r\n  country, where the mean temperature of the coldest month is nearly 7°\r\n  Fahr. above that of the hottest month in Paris; and this circumstance\r\n  cannot therefore change the three months’ summer-sleep of the Tenrec\r\n  in Madagascar and Port Louis (Isle of France) into actual hybernation.\r\n\r\n  In a similar manner, the Crocodile in the Llanos of Venezuela, the\r\n  land and water Tortoises on the Orinoco, and the colossal Boa, and\r\n  many of the smaller species of serpents, lie torpid and motionless in\r\n  the hardened ground, throughout the hot and dry season of the year.\r\n  The missionary Gilij relates, that the natives, in seeking the dormant\r\n  Terekai (land-tortoises), which lie buried in dry mud to the depth of\r\n  16 or 17 inches, are often bitten by serpents suddenly awakened, and\r\n  which had buried themselves with the tortoises. An admirable observer,\r\n  Dr. Peters, who has only just returned from the eastern coast of\r\n  Africa, writes to me as follows: “I could not obtain any certain\r\n  information regarding the Tenrec during my short stay in Madagascar,\r\n  but I am, on the other hand, well aware, that in the portion of\r\n  eastern Africa where I spent several years, different species of\r\n  tortoises (Pentonyx and Trionices) remain enclosed for months\r\n  together, without food, in the parched and indurated ground, during\r\n  the dry season of this tropical country. The _Lepidosiren_ also\r\n  remains motionless and coiled up in the hardened earth, from May to\r\n  December, wherever the swamps have been dried up.”\r\n\r\n  We thus meet with an enfeeblement of certain vital functions in\r\n  numerous and very different classes of animals, and, what is\r\n  peculiarly striking, without the same phenomenon presenting itself in\r\n  organisms nearly allied, and belonging to one and the same family. The\r\n  northern glutton (Gulo), allied to the badger (Meles), does not, like\r\n  the latter, sleep during the winter; whilst, according to Cuvier, “a\r\n  Myoxus (Dormouse of Senegal, Myoxus Coupeii) which had probably never\r\n  experienced a winter-sleep in its tropical home, fell into a state of\r\n  hybernation at the beginning of winter, the first year it was brought\r\n  to Europe.” This enfeeblement of the vital functions and vital\r\n  activity passes through several gradations, according as it extends to\r\n  the processes of nutrition, respiration and muscular movement, or\r\n  induces a depression of the cerebral and nervous systems. The\r\n  winter-sleep of the solitary bear and of the badger is not attended\r\n  with rigidity, and hence the awakening of these animals is easy, and,\r\n  as I frequently heard in Siberia, very dangerous to the hunters and\r\n  country people. The recognition of the gradation and connection of\r\n  these phenomena leads us to the so-called _vita minima_ of the\r\n  microscopic organisms, which occasionally fall in the Atlantic in\r\n  showers of meteoric dust, and some of which have green ovaries and are\r\n  engaged in a self-generating process. The apparent revivification of\r\n  the Rotifera and of the siliceous-shelled Infusoria is only the\r\n  renewal of long enfeebled vital functions—a condition of vitality\r\n  never entirely extinguished, but merely revived by excitation.\r\n  Physiological phenomena can only be comprehended by being traced\r\n  through the entire series of analogous modifications.\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  p. 211—“_Winged Insects_.”\r\n\r\n  The fructification of diœcious plants was at one time principally\r\n  ascribed to the agency of the wind. It has been shown by Kölreuter,\r\n  and also with much ingenuity by Sprengel, that bees, wasps and\r\n  numerous small winged insects, are the main agents in this process. I\r\n  use the phrase “main agents”, since I cannot regard it as consonant to\r\n  nature that fructification should be impossible without the\r\n  intervention of these insects, as Willdenow has also fully shewn.[KA]\r\n  On the other hand dichogamy, sap-marks, (_maculæ indicantes_),\r\n  coloured spots indicating the presence of honey-vessels, and\r\n  fructification by insects, appear to be almost inseparable from one\r\n  another.[KB]\r\n\r\n  The statement often repeated since Spallanzani, that the diœcious\r\n  common hemp (_Cannabis sativa_), which was introduced into Europe from\r\n  Persia, bears ripe seeds without being in the neighbourhood of\r\n  pollen-tubes, has been entirely refuted by more recent investigations.\r\n  When seeds have been obtained, anthers in a rudimentary state have\r\n  been found near the ovarium, and these may have been capable of\r\n  yielding some grains of fructifying pollen. Such hermaphrodism is\r\n  frequent in the whole family of _Urticeæ_, but a singular and hitherto\r\n  unexplained phenomenon is manifested in the forcing-houses at Kew by a\r\n  small New Holland shrub, the Cœlebogyne of Smith. This phanerogamic\r\n  plant brings forth seeds in England without exhibiting any trace of\r\n  male organs, and without the bastard introduction of the pollen of any\r\n  other plant. “A species of Euphorbiaceæ,” (?) writes the distinguished\r\n  botanist, Jussieu, “the _Cœlebogyne_, which, although but recently\r\n  described, has been cultivated for many years in English\r\n  conservatories, has several times borne seeds, which were evidently\r\n  perfect, since the well-formed embryos they contained have produced\r\n  similar plants. The most careful observations have hitherto failed in\r\n  discovering the slightest trace of anthers or even pollen in the\r\n  flowers, which are diœcious. No male plants of this kind are known to\r\n  exist in England. The embryo cannot therefore have come from the\r\n  pollen, which is wholly deficient, but must have been formed entirely\r\n  in the ovule.”[KC]\r\n\r\n  In order to obtain a fresh and confirmatory explanation of this\r\n  important and isolated physiological phenomenon, I lately addressed\r\n  myself to my young friend, Dr. Joseph Hooker, who after having\r\n  accompanied Sir James Ross in his Antarctic voyage, has now joined the\r\n  great Thibeto-Himalayan expedition. Dr. Hooker wrote to me as follows\r\n  from Alexandria, at the close of December, 1847, prior to his\r\n  embarkation at Suez: “Our Cœlebogyne still flowers with my father at\r\n  Kew, as well as in the Gardens of the Horticultural Society. It ripens\r\n  its seeds regularly. I have repeatedly examined it with care, but have\r\n  never been able to discover a penetration of pollen utricles into the\r\n  stigma, nor any traces of their presence in the latter or in the\r\n  style. In my herbarium the male blossoms are in small catkins.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  p. 212—“_Like luminous stars_.”\r\n\r\n  The phosphorescence of the ocean is one of those splendid phenomena of\r\n  nature which excite our admiration, even when we behold its recurrence\r\n  every night for months together. The ocean is phosphorescent in all\r\n  zones of the earth, but he who has not witnessed the phenomenon in the\r\n  tropics, and especially in the Pacific, can form but a very imperfect\r\n  idea of the majesty of this brilliant spectacle. The traveller on\r\n  board a man-of-war, when ploughing the foaming waves before a fresh\r\n  breeze, feels that he can scarcely satisfy himself with gazing on the\r\n  spectacle presented by the circling waves. Wherever the ship’s side\r\n  rises above the waves, bluish or reddish flames seem to flash\r\n  lightning-like upwards from the keel. The appearance presented in the\r\n  tropical seas on a dark night is indescribably glorious, when shoals\r\n  of dolphins are seen sporting around, and cutting the foaming waves in\r\n  long and circling lines, gleaming with bright and sparkling light. In\r\n  the Gulf of Cariaco, between Cumana and the Peninsula of Maniquarez, I\r\n  have spent hours in enjoying this spectacle.\r\n\r\n  Le Gentil and the elder Forster ascribed these flames to the\r\n  electrical friction of the water on the vessel as it glides forward—an\r\n  explanation that must, in the present condition of our physical\r\n  knowledge, be regarded as untenable.[KD]\r\n\r\n  There are probably few subjects of natural investigation which have\r\n  excited so many and such long-continued contentions as the\r\n  phosphorescence of sea-water. All that is known with certainty\r\n  regarding this much disputed question may be reduced to the following\r\n  simple facts. There are many luminous mollusca which possess the\r\n  property when alive of emitting at will a faint phosphoric light;\r\n  which is of a bluish tinge in _Nereis noctiluca_, _Medusa pelagica\r\n  var._ β,[KE] and in the pipe-like _Monophora noctiluca_, discovered in\r\n  Baudin’s expedition.[KF] The luminosity of sea-water is in part owing\r\n  to living light-bearing animals, and in part to the organic fibres and\r\n  membranes of the same, when in a state of decomposition. The\r\n  first-named of these causes of the phosphorescence of the ocean is\r\n  undoubtedly the most common and the most widely diffused. The more\r\n  actively and the more efficiently that travellers engaged in the study\r\n  of nature have learnt to employ powerful microscopes, the more our\r\n  zoological systems have been enriched by new groups of mollusca and\r\n  infusoria, whose property of emitting light either at will or from\r\n  external stimulus has been recognised.\r\n\r\n  The luminosity of the sea, as far as it depends on living organisms,\r\n  is principally owing, among zoophytes, to the Acalephæ (the families\r\n  of Medusæ and Cyaneæ), to some Mollusca, and to an innumerable host of\r\n  Infusoria. Among the small Acalephæ (Sea-nettles), the _Mammaria\r\n  scintillans_ presents us, as it were, with the glorious image of the\r\n  starry firmament reflected in the surface of the sea. When full-grown\r\n  this little creature scarcely equals in size the head of a pin. The\r\n  existence of siliceous-shelled luminous infusoria was first shown by\r\n  Michaelis at Kiel. He observed the coruscation of the Peridinium. (a\r\n  ciliated animalcule,) of the Cuirass-monad (_Prorocentrum micans_),\r\n  and of a rotifer, which he named Synchata baltica,[KG] the same that\r\n  Focke subsequently found in the lagoons of Venice. My distinguished\r\n  friend and fellow traveller in Siberia, Ehrenberg, succeeded in\r\n  keeping two luminous Infusoria of the Baltic alive for nearly two\r\n  months at Berlin. I examined them with him in 1832; and saw them\r\n  coruscate in a drop of sea-water on the darkened field of the\r\n  microscope. When these luminous Infusoria (the largest of which was\r\n  only ⅛ and the smallest from ¹⁄₄₈ to ¹⁄₉₆ of a of a Parisian line in\r\n  length) were exhausted, and ceased to emit sparks, they would renew\r\n  their flashing on being stimulated by the addition of acids or by the\r\n  application of a little alcohol to the sea-water.\r\n\r\n  By repeatedly filtering fresh sea-water, Ehrenberg succeeded in\r\n  procuring a fluid in which a large number of these light-emitting\r\n  animalcules were accumulated.[KH] This acute observer has found in the\r\n  organs of the Photocharis which give off flashes of light (either\r\n  voluntarily or when stimulated), a cellular structure of a gelatinous\r\n  character in the interior, and which manifests some similarity with\r\n  the electric organ of the Gymnotus and the Torpedo. “When the\r\n  Photocharis is irritated, in each cirrus a kindling and a gleaming of\r\n  separate sparks may be observed, which gradually increase and at\r\n  length illuminate the whole cirrus; until the living flame runs also\r\n  over the back of this nereid-like animalcule, making it appear under\r\n  the microscope like a burning thread of sulphur with a greenish-yellow\r\n  light. In the _Oceania (Thaumanthias) hemisphærica_, the number and\r\n  position of the sparks correspond accurately, at the thickened base,\r\n  with the larger cirri or organs which alternate with them, a\r\n  circumstance that merits special attention. The manifestation of this\r\n  wreath of fire is an act of vitality, and the whole development of\r\n  light an organic vital process, which exhibits itself in Infusorial\r\n  animals as a momentary spark of light, and is repeated after short\r\n  intervals of rest.”[KI]\r\n\r\n  The luminous animals of the ocean appear, from these conjectures, to\r\n  prove the existence of a magneto-electric light-generating vital\r\n  process in other classes of animals besides fishes, insects, mollusca,\r\n  and acalephæ. Is the secretion of the luminous fluid which is effused\r\n  in some animalcules, and which continues to shine for a long period\r\n  _without further influence of the living organism_ (as, for instance,\r\n  in Lampyrides and Elaterides, in the German and Italian glow-worms,\r\n  and in the South American Cucuyo of the sugar-cane), merely the\r\n  consequence of the first electric discharge, or is it simply dependent\r\n  on chemical composition? The luminosity of insects surrounded by air\r\n  assuredly depends on physiological causes different from those which\r\n  give rise to a luminous condition in aquatic animals, fishes, Medusæ,\r\n  and Infusoria. The small Infusoria of the ocean, being surrounded by\r\n  strata of salt-water which constitutes a powerful conducting medium,\r\n  must be capable of an enormous electric tension of their flashing\r\n  organs to enable them to shine so vividly in the water. They strike\r\n  like the Torpedo, the Gymnotus, and the Electric Silurus of the Nile,\r\n  through the stratum of water: whilst electric fishes which, in\r\n  connection with the galvanic circuit, are capable of decomposing\r\n  water, and of imparting magnetic power to steel needles. (as I showed\r\n  more than half a century ago,[KJ] and as John Davy has more recently\r\n  confirmed,[KK]) yield no indications of electricity through the\r\n  smallest intervening stratum of flame.\r\n\r\n  The considerations which we have here developed render it probable\r\n  that one and the same process operates, alike in the smallest living\r\n  organisms invisible to the naked eye, in the contests of the\r\n  serpent-like Gymnoti, in the flashing luminous Infusoria which impart\r\n  such glorious brilliancy to the phosphorescence of the sea, in the\r\n  thunder-cloud and in the terrestrial or polar light (the silent\r\n  magnetic flashes), which, caused by an increased tension of the\r\n  interior of the earth, are announced, for some hours previously, by\r\n  the sudden variations of the magnetic needle.[KL]\r\n\r\n  Sometimes one cannot, even with high magnifying powers, discover any\r\n  animalcules in the luminous water; and yet, wherever a wave breaks in\r\n  foam against a hard body, and, indeed, wherever water is violently\r\n  agitated, flashes of light become visible. The cause of this\r\n  phenomenon depends probably on the decomposing fibres of dead\r\n  Mollusca, which are diffused in the greatest abundance throughout the\r\n  water. If this luminous water be filtered through finely woven cloths,\r\n  the fibres and membranes appear like separate luminous points. When we\r\n  bathed at Cumana, in the gulf of Cariaco, and walked naked on the\r\n  solitary beach in the beautiful evening air, parts of our bodies\r\n  remained luminous from the bright fibres and organic membranes which\r\n  adhered to the skin, nor did they lose this light for some minutes. If\r\n  we consider the enormous quantity of Mollusca which animate all\r\n  tropical seas, we can hardly wonder that sea-water should be luminous,\r\n  even where no fibres can be visibly separated from it. From the\r\n  endless subdivision of the masses of dead _Dagysæ_ and _Medusæ_ the\r\n  whole ocean may, in fact, be regarded as a fluid containing gelatine,\r\n  and, as such, luminous and of a nauseous taste; unfit for the use of\r\n  man, but capable of affording nourishment to many species of fish. On\r\n  rubbing a board with a portion of the _Medusa hysocella_, the surface\r\n  thus rubbed recovers its phosphorescence when friction is applied by\r\n  means of the dry finger. During my voyage to South America I\r\n  occasionally placed a Medusa on a tin plate, and I then observed that\r\n  if I struck the plate with another metallic substance the slightest\r\n  vibrations of the tin were sufficient to cause the animal to emit\r\n  light. How do the blow and the vibrations here act? Is the temperature\r\n  momentarily augmented, or are new surfaces presented? or, again, does\r\n  some gaseous matter such as phosphuretted hydrogen, exude in\r\n  consequence of this impulse, and burn when it comes in contact with\r\n  the oxygen of the atmosphere, or with that dissolved in the sea-water,\r\n  and by which the respiration of the Mollusca is maintained? This\r\n  light-exciting effect of the blow is most remarkable in a cross or\r\n  sugar-loaf sea, (_mer clapoteuse_,) where the waves, clashing from\r\n  opposite directions, rise in a conical form.\r\n\r\n  I have seen the ocean, in the tropics, luminous in the most opposite\r\n  kinds of weather, but most strongly so before a storm, or in a sultry\r\n  and hazy atmosphere with thick clouds. Heat and cold appear to\r\n  exercise but little influence on this phenomenon, for, on the Bank of\r\n  Newfoundland, the phosphorescence is frequently very brilliant in the\r\n  severest winter. Occasionally, too, the sea will be highly luminous\r\n  one night, and not at all so on the following, notwithstanding an\r\n  apparent identity of external conditions. Does the atmosphere favour\r\n  this development of light? or do all the differences observed during\r\n  this phenomenon depend on the accidental circumstance of the sea being\r\n  more or less impregnated, in some parts, with the gelatinous portions\r\n  of mollusca? Perhaps these phosphorescent social animalcules only rise\r\n  to the surface under certain conditions of the atmosphere. It has been\r\n  asked, why our fresh-water swamps which are filled with polyps are not\r\n  phosphorescent. It would appear that, both in animals and plants, a\r\n  peculiar mixture of organic particles favours this development of\r\n  light; thus, for instance, the wood of the willow is more frequently\r\n  found to be luminous than that of the oak. In England, salt-water has\r\n  been rendered luminous by mixing herring-brine with it; indeed, it\r\n  will be easy for any one to convince himself by galvanic experiments,\r\n  that the luminosity of living animals depends on nervous irritation. I\r\n  have observed strong phosphorescence emitted from a dying _Elater\r\n  noctilucus_, on touching the ganglion of its fore leg with zinc and\r\n  silver. Medusæ also occasionally emit a stronger light at the moment\r\n  the galvanic circuit is completed.[KM]\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  p. 213—“_Which inhabits the lungs of the Rattlesnake of the tropics_.”\r\n\r\n  The animal which I formerly named an _Echinorhynchus_, and to which I\r\n  even applied the term _Porocephalus_, appears, on a closer inspection,\r\n  according to Rudolphi’s better grounded opinion, to belong to the\r\n  division of _Pentastoma_.[KN] It is found in the abdominal cavity and\r\n  the wide-celled lungs of a species of _Crotalus_, which, in Cumana,\r\n  occasionally infests even the interior of houses, and preys on mice.\r\n  The _Ascaris lumbrici_[KO] lives beneath the skin of the common\r\n  earth-worm, and is the smallest of all the species of Ascaris.\r\n  _Leucophra nodulata_, Gleichen’s pearl animalcule, has been observed\r\n  by Otto Friedrich Müller in the interior of the reddish _Nais\r\n  littoralis_.[KP] It is probable that these microscopic animals are, in\r\n  their turn, inhabited by others. All are surrounded by air, deficient\r\n  in oxygen, and copiously charged with hydrogen and carbonic acid. It\r\n  is extremely doubtful whether any animal could exist in _pure\r\n  nitrogen_, although such an opinion did, formerly indeed, seem\r\n  warranted with reference to Fischer’s _Cistidicola farionis_, since,\r\n  according to Fourcroy’s experiments, the swimming-bladder of fish was\r\n  presumed to contain air wholly devoid of oxygen. But the experiments\r\n  made by Erman, and confirmed by myself, prove that the\r\n  swimming-bladder of fresh-water fish never contains pure nitrogen.[KQ]\r\n  In sea fish as much as 0·80 parts of oxygen have been found, while,\r\n  according to Biot’s views, the purity of the air depends on the depth\r\n  at which the fishes live.[KR]\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  p. 214—“_The united Lithophytes_.”\r\n\r\n  According to Linnæus and Ellis the calcareous Zoophytes, (among which\r\n  Madrepores, Meandrinæ, Astrææ, and Pocilloporæ especially produce\r\n  mural coral-reefs,) are inhabited and invested by animalcules, which\r\n  were long supposed to be allied to the Nereids belonging to Cuvier’s\r\n  Annelida (jointed worms). The anatomy of these gelatinous animalcules\r\n  has been made known by the acute and comprehensive researches of\r\n  Cavolini, Savigny, and Ehrenberg. We have learned that, in order to\r\n  understand the whole organism of the (so-called) rock-building\r\n  animals, we must not consider the scaffolding which remains after\r\n  their death, namely, the layers of lime formed into delicate lamellæ\r\n  by a vital function of secretion, as foreign to the soft membranes of\r\n  the food-receiving animal.\r\n\r\n  Besides our increased knowledge of the wonderful formation of the\r\n  living coral-stocks, a more correct view has gradually gained ground\r\n  respecting the extensive influence which the coral world has exercised\r\n  on the appearance of low island groups above the level of the sea, on\r\n  the migration of land-plants, and the successive extension of the\r\n  domain of the Floras, and, indeed, in some parts of the ocean, on the\r\n  distribution of the human race and of languages.\r\n\r\n  As minute social organisms the corals play an important part in the\r\n  general economy of nature, although they do not, as people began to\r\n  believe after Capt. Cook’s voyages of discovery, build up islands or\r\n  enlarge continents from almost unfathomable depths of the ocean. They\r\n  excite the liveliest interest, whether regarded as physiological\r\n  objects, and as illustrating the various gradations of animal form, or\r\n  in connection with the geography of plants, and the geognostic\r\n  relations of the earth’s crust. According to the comprehensive views\r\n  of Leopold von Buch, the whole Jura-formation consists of “large\r\n  elevated coral-banks of the ancient world, surrounding at a certain\r\n  distance the old mountain chains.”\r\n\r\n  According to Ehrenberg’s classification,[KS] coral-animals, (in\r\n  English works often incorrectly termed coral-insects,) are separable\r\n  into the monostomous _Anthozoa_, which are either free and with the\r\n  power of detaching themselves, as _Animal-corals_; or are attached in\r\n  the manner of plants, as _Phyto-corals_. To the first order\r\n  (Zoocorallia) belong the Hydras or Armpolyps of Trembley, the Actiniæ,\r\n  radiant with the most splendid colours, and the mushroom-corals; and\r\n  to the second order belong the Madrepores, the Astrææ, and the\r\n  Ocellinæ. The Polyps of the second order are those which from their\r\n  cellular, wave-resisting, wall-works are the principal subject of this\r\n  illustration. The wall-work is composed of the aggregate of the\r\n  coral-trunks, which, however, do not suddenly lose their combined\r\n  vitality, like a dead forest tree.\r\n\r\n  Every coral-trunk arises by a process of gemmation in accordance with\r\n  certain laws, and forms one complete structure, each portion being\r\n  formed by a great number of organically distinct individual animals.\r\n  In the group of Phyto-corals these cannot separate themselves\r\n  spontaneously, but remain united with one another by lamellæ of\r\n  carbonate of lime. Hence each coral-trunk by no means possesses a\r\n  central point of common vitality.[KT] The propagation of\r\n  coral-animals, according to the difference of the orders, is by eggs,\r\n  spontaneous division or gemmation. This last kind of propagation\r\n  presents the greatest variety of forms in the development of\r\n  individuals.\r\n\r\n  The Coral-reefs (or, as Dioscorides designates them, sea-plants, a\r\n  forest of stony-trees, Lithodendra), are of three kinds; namely,\r\n  _Coast-reefs_, (shore-reefs, fringing-reefs), which are directly\r\n  connected with continental or insular coasts, as on the north-east\r\n  coast of New Holland, between Sandy Cape and the dreaded Torres\r\n  Straits, and almost all the coral-banks of the Red Sea examined for\r\n  eighteen months by Ehrenberg and Hemprich; _Island-surrounding reefs_\r\n  (barrier-reefs, encircling-reefs), as at Vanikoro in the small\r\n  archipelago of Santa Cruz, north of the New Hebrides, and at\r\n  Puynipete, one of the Carolinas; and _Coral-banks surrounding lagoons_\r\n  (Atolls or Lagoon-islands). This very natural division and\r\n  nomenclature have been introduced by Charles Darwin, and are most\r\n  intimately connected with the very ingenious explanation which this\r\n  intellectual naturalist has given of the gradual origin of these\r\n  wonderful forms. While, on the one hand, Cavolini, Ehrenberg, and\r\n  Savigny have completed the scientific anatomical knowledge of the\r\n  organization of coral-animals, on the other, the geographical and\r\n  geological relations of coral-islands have been investigated, first by\r\n  Reinhold and George Forster in Cook’s second voyage, and then, after a\r\n  long interval, by Chamisso, Péron, Quoy and Gaimard, Flinders, Lütke,\r\n  Beechey, Darwin, d’Urville, and Lottin.\r\n\r\n  The coral-animals and their stony cellular scaffoldings belong, for\r\n  the most part, to the warm tropical seas; and the reefs occur most\r\n  frequently in the Southern Hemisphere. Thus we find the Atolls or\r\n  Lagoon Islands crowded together in the so-called coral-sea between the\r\n  north-east coast of New Holland, New Caledonia, Solomon’s Islands, and\r\n  the Louisiade Archipelago; in the group of the Low Islands (Low\r\n  Archipelago), eighty in number; in the Fidji, Ellice, and Gilbert\r\n  Islands; and in the Indian Ocean, north-east of Madagascar, under the\r\n  name of the Atoll group of Saya de Malha.\r\n\r\n  The great Chagos Bank, whose structure and dead coral-trunks have been\r\n  thoroughly investigated by Captains Moresby and Powell, is the more\r\n  interesting to us, because we may regard it as a prolongation of the\r\n  more northern Laccadive and Maldive Islands. I have previously\r\n  directed attention in another work[KU] to the importance of the order\r\n  of succession of the Atolls, which are exactly in the direction of a\r\n  meridian as far as 7° south lat., in reference to the general mountain\r\n  system, and the form of the earth’s surface, in Central Asia. The\r\n  meridian-chains, which mark the intersection of many mountain-systems\r\n  running from east to west at the great bend of the Thibetian river\r\n  Tzang-bo, correspond with the great meridian mountain rampart of the\r\n  Ghauts and of the more northern Bolor in further or trans-Gangetic\r\n  India. Here lie the parallel chains of Cochin China, Siam, and\r\n  Malacca, as well as those of Ava and Arracan, which, after courses of\r\n  unequal length, all terminate in the gulfs of Siam, Martaban, and\r\n  Bengal. The bay of Bengal appears like an arrested effort of nature to\r\n  produce an inland sea. A deep inbreak of the waters, between the\r\n  simple western system of the Ghauts, and the very complex eastern\r\n  trans-Gangetic system, has swallowed up a great part of the eastern\r\n  lowlands, but met with an impediment not so easily overcome in the\r\n  early existing and extensive table-land of Mysore.\r\n\r\n  An oceanic inbreak of this nature has given rise to two almost\r\n  pyramidal peninsulas of very different length and narrowness; and the\r\n  prolongation of two opposing meridian systems, the mountain system of\r\n  Malacca in the east, and the Ghauts of Malabar in the west, manifests\r\n  itself in submarine, symmetrical series of islands, on the one side in\r\n  the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which are poor in corals, and on the\r\n  other in three long-extended archipelagos of Atolls—the Laccadives,\r\n  the Maldives, and Chagos. The last, called by mariners the Chagos\r\n  Bank, forms a lagoon, belted by a narrow, and already much broken\r\n  coral-reef. The length of this lagoon is 88, and its breadth 72 miles.\r\n  Whilst the enclosed lagoon is only from 17 to 40 fathoms deep, bottom\r\n  was scarcely found at a depth of 210 fathoms at a small distance from\r\n  the outer margin of the coral wall, which appears to be now\r\n  sinking.[KV] At the coral-lagoon, known as Keeling-Atoll, south of\r\n  Sumatra, Captain Fitz-Roy states, that at only 2000 yards from the\r\n  reef, no soundings were found with 7200 feet of line.\r\n\r\n  “The forms of coral, which in the Red Sea rise in thick wall-like\r\n  masses, are Mæandrinæ, Astrææ, Favia, Madrepores (Porites),\r\n  Pocillopora (Hemprichii), Millepores, and Heteropores. The latter are\r\n  among the most massive, although they are branched. The deepest coral\r\n  trunks, which magnified by the refraction of light, appear to the eye\r\n  to resemble the dome of a cathedral, belong, as far as could be\r\n  determined, to Mæandrinæ and Astrææ.”[KW] A distinction must be made\r\n  between single and in part free polyp-trunks, and those which form\r\n  wall-like rocks.\r\n\r\n  If the accumulation of building polyp-trunks in some regions is so\r\n  striking, it is no less astonishing to observe the perfect absence of\r\n  these structures in other and often adjacent regions. Their presence\r\n  or absence must be determined by certain, still uninvestigated,\r\n  relations of currents, by the partial temperature of the water, and by\r\n  the abundance or deficiency of nutriment. That certain\r\n  delicate-branched corals, with less calcareous deposition on the side\r\n  opposite to the mouth, prefer the stillness of the interior lagoons,\r\n  is not to be denied; but this preference for still water must not, as\r\n  has too often happened,[KX] be regarded as a peculiarity of the whole\r\n  class of these animals. According to the experiences of Ehrenberg and\r\n  Chamisso in the Red Sea and in the Marshall Islands, which abound in\r\n  Atolls and lie east of the Caroline Islands, and according to the\r\n  observations of Captains Bird Allen and Moresby in the West Indies and\r\n  in the Maldives, we find that living Madrepores, Millepores, Astræas,\r\n  and Mæandrinas, can support “a tremendous surf;”[KY] and indeed seem\r\n  to prefer localities the most exposed to the action of storms. The\r\n  vital forces of the organism regulating the cellular structure, which\r\n  with age acquires a rocky hardness, resist most triumphantly the\r\n  mechanical forces,—the shock of moving waters.\r\n\r\n  In the South Pacific there is a perfect absence of coral-reefs at the\r\n  Galapagos and along the whole of the west coast of the New Continent,\r\n  notwithstanding their vicinity to the numerous Atolls of the Low\r\n  Islands, and the Archipelago of Mendaña or the Marquesas. It is true\r\n  that the current of the South Pacific, which washes the coasts of\r\n  Chili and Peru. (and whose low temperature I observed in the year\r\n  1802,) is only 60°.1 Fahr., while the undisturbed water at the sides\r\n  of the cold current is from 81°.5 to 83°.7 Fahr. at Punta Parima,\r\n  where it deflects to the west. Moreover at the Galapagos there are\r\n  small currents between the islands, having a temperature of only 58°.3\r\n  Fahr. But this lower temperature does not prevail further northwards\r\n  along the coasts of the Pacific from Guayaquil to Guatimala and\r\n  Mexico, neither does it prevail in the Cape de Verd Islands, on the\r\n  whole west coast of Africa, or at the small islands of St. Paul, St.\r\n  Helena, Ascension, and San Fernando Noronha; yet in none of these are\r\n  there coral-reefs.\r\n\r\n  If this absence of reefs characterises the _western_ coasts of\r\n  America, Africa, and New Holland, they are, on the other hand, of\r\n  frequent occurrence on the _eastern_ coasts of tropical America, on\r\n  the African coast of Zanzibar, and on the southern coast of New South\r\n  Wales. The best opportunities I have enjoyed for personally examining\r\n  coral banks have been in the Gulf of Mexico, and south of the Island\r\n  of Cuba, in the so-called “Gardens of the King and Queen” (_Jardines y\r\n  Jardinillos del Rey y de la Reyna_). It was Christopher Columbus\r\n  himself who, on his second voyage, in May, 1494, gave this name to\r\n  this little group of islands, because from the pleasant association of\r\n  the silver-leaved arborescent Tournefortia gnapholoides, of flowering\r\n  species of Dolichos, of Avicennia nitida, and mangrove-thickets\r\n  (Rhizophora), the coral-islands formed as it were an archipelago of\r\n  floating gardens. “_Son Cayos verdes y graciosos llenos de\r\n  arboledas_,” says the admiral. On my voyage from Batabano to Trinidad\r\n  de Cuba, I remained for several days in these gardens, which lie to\r\n  the east of the great Isle of Pines, abounding in mahogany, for the\r\n  purpose of determining the longitude of the different _Cayos_.\r\n\r\n  The _Cayos Flamenco_, _Bonito_, _de Diego Perez_, and _de Piedras_,\r\n  are coral islands, rising only from 8 to 15 inches above the level of\r\n  the sea. The upper edge of the reef does not consist merely of dead\r\n  polyp-trunks, but is rather formed of a true conglomerate, in which\r\n  angular pieces of coral, lying in various directions, are embedded in\r\n  a cement composed of granules of quartz. In Cayo de Piedras I saw such\r\n  embedded masses of coral, some of them measuring upwards of three\r\n  cubic feet. Several of the West Indian smaller coral islands have\r\n  fresh water, a phenomenon which merits a careful investigation\r\n  wherever it occurs (as for instance near Radak in the South Sea),[KZ]\r\n  since it has sometimes been ascribed to hydrostatic pressure, acting\r\n  from a distant coast (as in Venice, and in the Bay of Xagua, east of\r\n  Batabano), and sometimes to the filtration of rain-water.[LA]\r\n\r\n  The living gelatinous covering of the calcareous fabric of the\r\n  coral-trunks attracts fishes and even turtles in search of food. In\r\n  the time of Columbus the now desolate district of the Jardines del Rey\r\n  was animated by a singular branch of industry pursued by the\r\n  inhabitants of the sea-coasts of Cuba, who availed themselves of a\r\n  little fish, the Remora, or sucking-fish (the so-called Ship-holder),\r\n  probably the Echeneis naucrates, for catching turtles. A long and\r\n  strong line, made of the fibres of the palm, was attached to the tail\r\n  of the fish. The Remora (called in Spanish _Reves_, or reversed,\r\n  because at first sight the back and abdomen might easily be mistaken\r\n  for each other), attaches itself by suction to the turtle through the\r\n  indented and moveable cartilaginous plates of the upper shell that\r\n  covers the head. The Remora, says Columbus, would rather let itself be\r\n  torn to pieces than relinquish its prey, and the little fish and the\r\n  turtle are thus drawn out of the water together. “Nostrates,” says\r\n  Martin Anghiera, the learned secretary of Charles V, “piscem Reversum\r\n  appellant, quod versus venatur. Non aliter ac nos canibus gallicis per\r\n  æquora campi lepores insectamur, illi (incolæ Cubæ insulæ) venatorio\r\n  pisce pisces alios capiebant.”[LB] We learn from Dampier and\r\n  Commerson, that this artifice of employing a sucking-fish to catch\r\n  other fishes is very common on the eastern coasts of Africa, near Cape\r\n  Natal and Mozambique, as well as on the island of Madagascar.[LC] An\r\n  acquaintance with the habits of animals, and the same necessities,\r\n  lead to similar artifices and modes of capture amongst tribes having\r\n  no connection with one another.\r\n\r\n  Although, as we have already remarked, the actual seat of the\r\n  Lithophytes who build calcareous walls, lies within a zone extending\r\n  from 22 to 24 degrees on either side of the equator, yet coral-reefs,\r\n  favoured, it is supposed, by the warm Gulf Stream, are met with around\r\n  the Bermudas in 32° 23′ lat., and these have been admirably described\r\n  by Lieutenant Nelson.[LD] In the southern hemisphere corals\r\n  (Millepores and Cellepores) are found singly as far as Chiloe and even\r\n  to the Chonos-Archipelago and Tierra del Fuego, in 53° lat., while\r\n  Retepores have even been found as far as 72½° lat.\r\n\r\n  Since Captain Cook’s second voyage, the hypothesis advanced by him as\r\n  well as by Reinhold and George Forster, that the flat coral islands of\r\n  the South Pacific have been built up by living agents from the depths\r\n  of the sea’s bottom, has found numerous advocates. The distinguished\r\n  naturalists Quoy and Gaimard, who accompanied Captain Freycinet on his\r\n  voyage of circumnavigation in the frigate “Uranie,” were the first who\r\n  expressed themselves, in 1823, with much freedom against the views\r\n  advanced by the two Forsters (father and son), by Flinders, and\r\n  Péron.[LE] “In directing the attention of naturalists to\r\n  coral-animalcules,” they say, “we hope to be able to prove that all\r\n  which has been hitherto affirmed or believed up to the present time,\r\n  regarding the immense structures they are capable of raising, is for\r\n  the most part inexact, and in all cases very greatly exaggerated. We\r\n  are rather of opinion that coral-animalcules, instead of rearing\r\n  perpendicular walls from the depths of the Ocean, only form strata or\r\n  incrustrations of some few toises in thickness.” Quoy and Gaimard (p.\r\n  289) have also expressed an opinion, that Atolls (coral walls\r\n  inclosing a lagoon) owe their origin to submarine volcanic craters.\r\n  They have undoubtedly underrated the depth at which animals who\r\n  construct coral-reefs (as for example the Astræa) can exist, as they\r\n  place the extreme limits at from 26 to 32 feet below the level of the\r\n  sea. Charles Darwin, a naturalist, who has known how to enhance the\r\n  value of his own observations by a comparison with those of others in\r\n  many parts of the world, places the region of living coral-animals at\r\n  a depth of 20 or 30 fathoms,[LF] which corresponds with that in which\r\n  Professor Edward Forbes found the greatest number of corals in the\r\n  Ægean Sea. This is Professor Forbes’s fourth region of marine-animals,\r\n  as given in his ingenious memoir on the _Provinces of Depth_, and the\r\n  geographical distribution of Mollusca at perpendicular distances from\r\n  the surface.[LG] It would appear, however, that the depth at which\r\n  corals live is very different in the different species, especially in\r\n  the more delicate ones which do not form such considerable structures.\r\n\r\n  Sir James Ross, in his Antarctic expedition, brought up corals from a\r\n  great depth with the lead; and these he remitted for accurate\r\n  examination to Mr. Stokes and Professor Forbes. Westward of Victoria\r\n  Land, in the neighbourhood of the Coulman Island, in 72° 31′ south\r\n  lat., and at a depth of 270 fathoms, Retepora cellulosa, a Hornera,\r\n  and Prymnoa Rossii. (the latter very similar to a species common to\r\n  the coasts of Norway,) were found alive and in a perfectly fresh\r\n  condition.[LH] In the far north too, the Greenland _Umbellaria\r\n  Grœnlandica_ has been brought up alive by whale fishers from a depth\r\n  of 236 fathoms.[LI] The same relation between species and locality is\r\n  met with among sponges, which however are now regarded as belonging\r\n  more to plants than to zoophytes. On the shores of Asia Minor, the\r\n  common marine sponge is brought up from depths varying from 5 to 36\r\n  fathoms, although one very small species of the same genus is only\r\n  found at a depth of at least 180 fathoms.[LJ] It is difficult to\r\n  divine what hinders the Astræas, Madrepores, Mæandrinas, and the whole\r\n  group of tropical phyto-corals, which are capable of constructing\r\n  large cellular calcareous walls, from living in very deep strata of\r\n  water. The decrease of temperature is very gradual, the diminution of\r\n  light nearly the same, and the existence of numerous Infusoria at\r\n  great depths of the Ocean proves that there cannot here be any\r\n  deficiency of food for polyps.\r\n\r\n  In opposition to the hitherto generally adopted opinion respecting the\r\n  absence of all organisms and living creatures in the Dead Sea, it is\r\n  worthy of notice that my friend and fellow-labourer, M. Valenciennes,\r\n  has received, through the Marquis Charles de l’Escalopier, and through\r\n  the French Consul Botta, beautiful specimens of Porites elongata from\r\n  the Dead Sea. This fact is the more interesting, because this species\r\n  is not found in the Mediterranean, but only in the Red Sea, which,\r\n  according to Valenciennes, has but few organisms in common with the\r\n  Mediterranean. As a sea-fish, a species of Pleuronectes, advances far\r\n  into the interior of France, and accustoms itself to gill-respiration\r\n  in fresh water, so also does a remarkable flexibility of organization\r\n  exist in the above-mentioned coral-animal (Porites elongata of\r\n  Lamarck), as the same species lives both in the Dead Sea, which is\r\n  supersaturated with salt, and in the open ocean near the Séchelles\r\n  Islands.[LK]\r\n\r\n  According to the most recent chemical analyses of the younger\r\n  Silliman, the genus Porites, like many other cellular coral-trunks\r\n  (Madrepores, Astræas, and Mæandrinas of Ceylon and the Bermudas),\r\n  contains besides from 92 to 95 per cent. of carbonate of lime and\r\n  magnesia, a portion of fluorine and phosphoric acid.[LL] The presence\r\n  of fluorine in the hard skeleton of the polyps reminds us of the\r\n  fluoride of calcium found in fish bones according to Morechini’s and\r\n  Gay-Lussac’s experiments at Rome. Silex is mixed only in very small\r\n  quantities, with the fluoride of calcium and phosphate of lime found\r\n  in the coral-trunks; but one coral animal allied to the Horn corals\r\n  (Gray’s _Hyalonema_, Glass thread) has an axis of fibres of pure\r\n  silex, resembling a hanging tuft of hair. Professor Forchhammer, who\r\n  has recently been engaged in a thorough analysis of sea-water in the\r\n  most opposite parts of the earth’s surface, finds the quantity of lime\r\n  in the Caribbean Sea remarkably small, it being only ²⁴⁷⁄₁₀₀₀₀, whilst\r\n  in the Cattegat it amounts to ³⁷¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀. He is disposed to ascribe\r\n  this difference to the numerous coral-banks near the West India\r\n  Islands, which appropriate the lime to themselves, and thus exhaust\r\n  the sea-water.[LM]\r\n\r\n  Charles Darwin has with great ingenuity developed the genetic\r\n  connection between shore-reefs, island-encircling reefs, and lagoon\r\n  islands, _i. e._, narrow, annular coral banks which surround inner\r\n  lagoons. According to his views, these three kinds of structure depend\r\n  upon the oscillating condition of the bottom of the sea, or on\r\n  periodical elevations and subsidences. The often-advanced hypothesis,\r\n  according to which the lagoon-islands, or atolls, mark by their\r\n  circularly enclosed coral-reefs, the outline of a submarine crater,\r\n  raised on a volcanic crater-margin, is opposed by the great extent of\r\n  their diameters, which are in some instances upwards of 30, 40, or\r\n  even 60 miles. Our fire-emitting mountains have no such craters, and\r\n  if we would compare the lagoon, with its submerged mural surface and\r\n  narrow encircling reef, with one of the annular lunar mountains, we\r\n  must not forget that these annular mountains are not volcanoes, but\r\n  tracts of land enclosed by walls. According to Darwin, the following\r\n  is the process of formation. An island mountain closely encircled by a\r\n  coral reef subsides, while the _fringing_ reef that had sunk with it,\r\n  is constantly recovering its level owing to the tendency of the coral\r\n  animals to regain the surface by renewed perpendicular structures;\r\n  these constitute first a reef encircling the island at a distance, and\r\n  subsequently, when the inclosed island has wholly subsided, an\r\n  _atoll_. According to this view, which regards islands as the most\r\n  prominent parts, or the culminating points of the submarine land, the\r\n  relative position of the coral islands would disclose to us what we\r\n  could scarcely hope to discover by the sounding line, viz., the former\r\n  configuration and articulation of the land. This attractive subject\r\n  (to the connection of which with the migrations of plants and the\r\n  distribution of the races of men we drew attention at the beginning of\r\n  this note), can only be fully elucidated when we shall succeed in\r\n  acquiring further knowledge of the depth and nature of the different\r\n  rocks which serve as a foundation for the lower strata of the dead\r\n  polyp-trunks.\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  p. 216—“_Of the Samothracian Traditions_.”\r\n\r\n  Diodorus has preserved to us these remarkable traditions, the\r\n  probability of which has invested them with almost historical\r\n  certainty in the eyes of geologists. The island of Samothrace, once\r\n  also named Ethiopea, Dardania, and Leucania or Leucosia in the\r\n  Scholiast of Apollonius Rhodius, the seat of the ancient mysteries of\r\n  the Cabiri, was inhabited by the remnant of an aboriginal people,\r\n  several words of whose vernacular language were preserved in later\r\n  times in sacrificial ceremonies. The position of Samothrace, opposite\r\n  to the Thracian Hebrus, and near the Dardanelles, explains why a more\r\n  circumstantial tradition of the great catastrophe of an outburst of\r\n  the waters of the Pontus (Euxine) should have been especially\r\n  preserved in this island. Sacred rites were here performed at altars\r\n  erected on the supposed limits of this inundation; and among the\r\n  Samothracians, as well as the Bœetians, a belief in the periodical\r\n  destruction of the human race (a belief which also prevailed among the\r\n  Mexicans in their myth of the four destructions of the world) was\r\n  associated with historical recollections of individual\r\n  inundations.[LN] According to Diodorus, the Samothracians related that\r\n  the Black Sea had been an inland lake, which, swelled by the influx of\r\n  rivers (long prior to the inundations which had occurred among other\r\n  nations) had burst, first through the straits of the Bosphorus, and\r\n  subsequently through those of the Hellespont.[LO] These ancient\r\n  revolutions of nature have been considered in a special treatise, by\r\n  Dureau de la Malle, and all the facts known regarding them collected\r\n  by Carl von Hoff, in an important work on the subject.[LP] The\r\n  Samothracian traditions seem reflected as it were in the Sluice-theory\r\n  of Strato of Lampsacus, according to which the swelling of the waters\r\n  in the Euxine first formed the passage of the Dardanelles, and next\r\n  the opening through the Pillars of Hercules. Strabo, in the first book\r\n  of his Geography, has preserved among the critical extracts from the\r\n  works of Eratosthenes, a remarkable fragment of the lost work of\r\n  Strato, which presents views that embrace almost the whole\r\n  circumference of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n  “Strato of Lampsacus,” says Strabo,[LQ] “enters more fully than the\r\n  Lydian Xanthus (who has described the impressions of shells far from\r\n  the sea) into a consideration of the causes of these phenomena. He\r\n  maintains, that the Euxine had formerly no outlet at Byzantium, but\r\n  that the pressure of the swollen mass of waters caused by the influx\r\n  of rivers had opened a passage, whereupon the water rushed into the\r\n  Propontis and the Hellespont. The same thing also happened to _our_\r\n  sea (the Mediterranean), for here too a passage was opened through the\r\n  isthmus at the Pillars of Hercules, in consequence of the filling of\r\n  the sea by currents, which in flowing off left the former swampy banks\r\n  uncovered and dry. In proof of this, Strato affirms, first, that the\r\n  outer and inner bottoms of the sea are different; then that there is\r\n  still a bank running under the sea from Europe to Lybia, which shows\r\n  that the inner and outer sea were formerly not united; next that the\r\n  Euxine is extremely shallow, while the Cretan, the Sicilian and the\r\n  Sardinian seas are, on the contrary, very deep; the cause of this\r\n  being that the former is filled with mud from the numerous large\r\n  rivers flowing into it from the north. Hence too the Euxine is the\r\n  freshest, and the streams flowing from it are directed towards the\r\n  parts where the bottom is deepest. It would also appear that if these\r\n  rivers continue to flow into the Euxine, it will some day be\r\n  completely choked with mud, for even now, its left side is becoming\r\n  marshy in the direction of Salmydessus (the Thracian Apollonia), at\r\n  the part called by mariners ‘The Breasts,’ before the mouth of the\r\n  Ister and the desert of Scythia. Perhaps, therefore, the Lybian Temple\r\n  of Ammon may also have once stood on the sea-shore, its present\r\n  position in the interior of the country being in consequence of such\r\n  off-flowings of rivers. Strato also conjectures that the fame and\r\n  celebrity of the Oracle (of Ammon) is more easily accounted for, on\r\n  the supposition that the temple was on the sea-shore, since its great\r\n  distance from the coast would otherwise make its present distinction\r\n  and fame inexplicable. Egypt also was in ancient times overflowed by\r\n  the sea as far as the marshes of Pelusium, Mount Casius, and Lake\r\n  Serbonis; for whenever in digging it happened that salt-water was met\r\n  with, the borings passed through strata of sea-sand and shells, as if\r\n  the country had been inundated, and the whole district around Mount\r\n  Casius and Gerrha had been a marshy sea, continuous with the Gulf of\r\n  the Red Sea. When the sea (the Mediterranean) retreated, the country\r\n  was uncovered, leaving, however, the present Lake Serbonis.\r\n  Subsequently the waters of this lake also flowed off, converting its\r\n  bed into a swamp. In like manner the banks of Lake Mœris resemble more\r\n  the shores of a sea than those of a river.” An erroneous reading\r\n  introduced as an emendation by Grosskurd, in consequence of a passage\r\n  in Strabo,[LR] gives in place of Mœris, “the Lake Halmyris,” but the\r\n  latter was situated near the southern mouth of the Danube.\r\n\r\n  The Sluice-theory of Strato led Eratosthenes of Cyrene (the most\r\n  celebrated in the series of the librarians of Alexandria) to\r\n  investigate the problem of the uniformity of level in all external\r\n  seas flowing round continents, although with less success than\r\n  Archimedes in his treatise on floating bodies.[LS] The articulation of\r\n  the northern coasts of the Mediterranean as well as the form of its\r\n  peninsulas and islands had given origin to the geognostic myth of the\r\n  ancient land of Lyctonia. The origin of the lesser Syrtis, of the\r\n  Triton Lake,[LT] and of the whole of Western Atlas,[LU] had been\r\n  embodied in an imaginary scheme of fire-eruptions and earthquakes.[LV]\r\n  I have recently entered more fully into this question,[LW] in a\r\n  passage with which I would be allowed to close this note:\r\n\r\n  “The northern shore of the Mediterranean possesses the advantage of\r\n  being more richly and variously articulated than the southern or\r\n  Lybian shore, and this was, according to Strabo, already noticed by\r\n  Eratosthenes. Here we find three peninsulas, the Iberian, the Italian,\r\n  and the Hellenic, which, owing to their various and deeply indented\r\n  contour, form, together with the neighbouring islands and the opposite\r\n  coasts, many straits and isthmuses. Such a configuration of continents\r\n  and of islands that have been partly severed and partly upheaved by\r\n  volcanic agency in rows, as if over far-extending fissures, early led\r\n  to geognostic views regarding eruptions, terrestrial revolutions, and\r\n  outpourings of the swollen higher seas into those below them. The\r\n  Euxine, the Dardanelles, the Straits of Gades, and the Mediterranean\r\n  with its numerous islands, were well fitted to originate such a system\r\n  of sluices. The Orphic Argonaut, who probably lived in the Christian\r\n  era, has interwoven old mythical narrations in his composition. He\r\n  sings of the division of the ancient Lyctonia into separate islands,\r\n  ‘when the dark-haired Poseidon in anger with Father Kronion struck\r\n  Lyctonia with the golden trident.’ Similar fancies, which may often\r\n  certainly have sprung from an imperfect knowledge of geographical\r\n  relations, were frequently elaborated in the erudite Alexandrian\r\n  school, which was so devoted to everything connected with antiquity.\r\n  Whether the myth of the breaking up of Atlantis be a vague and western\r\n  reflection of that of Lyctonia, as I have elsewhere shown to be\r\n  probable, or whether, according to Otfried Müller, ‘the destruction of\r\n  Lyctonia (Leuconia) refers to the Samothracian tradition of a great\r\n  flood, which changed the form of that district,’ is a question which\r\n  it is here unnecessary to decide.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  p. 217—“_Precipitation from the clouds_.”\r\n\r\n  The vertical ascent of currents of air is one of the principal causes\r\n  of the most important meteorological phenomena. Where a desert or a\r\n  sandy surface devoid of vegetation is surrounded by a high\r\n  mountain-chain, the sea-wind may be observed driving a dense cloud\r\n  over the desert, without any precipitation of vapour taking place\r\n  before it reaches the crest of the mountains. This phenomenon was\r\n  formerly very unsatisfactorily referred to an _attraction_ supposed to\r\n  be exercised by the mountain-chain on the clouds. The true cause\r\n  appears to lie in the ascent from the sandy plain of a column of warm\r\n  air, which prevents the condensation of the vesicles of vapour. The\r\n  more barren the surface, and the greater the degree of heat acquired\r\n  by the sand, the higher will be the ascent of the clouds, and the less\r\n  readily will the vapour be precipitated. Over the declivities of\r\n  mountains these causes cease. The play of the vertical column of air\r\n  is there weaker; the clouds sink, and their disintegration is effected\r\n  by a cooler stratum of air. Thus _deficiency of rain_ and _absence of\r\n  vegetation in the desert_ stand in a reciprocal action to one another.\r\n  It does not rain because the barren and bare surface of sand becomes\r\n  more strongly heated and radiates more heat; and the desert is not\r\n  converted into a steppe or grassy plain because without water no\r\n  organic development is possible.\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  p. 218—“_The indurating and heat-emitting mass of the earth_.”\r\n\r\n  If according to the hypothesis of the Neptunists (now long since\r\n  obsolete), the so-called primitive rocks were also precipitated from a\r\n  fluid, the transition of the earth’s crust from a condition of\r\n  fluidity to one of solidity, must have been followed by the liberation\r\n  of an enormous quantity of caloric, which would have given rise to new\r\n  evaporation and new precipitations. The more recent these\r\n  precipitations, the more rapid, the more tumultuous, and the more\r\n  uncrystalline would they have been. Such a sudden liberation of\r\n  caloric from the indurating crust of the earth, independent of the\r\n  latitude, and the position of the earth’s axis, might indeed occasion\r\n  local elevations of temperature in the atmosphere, which would\r\n  influence the distribution of plants. The same cause might also\r\n  occasion a kind of porosity which seems to be indicated by many\r\n  enigmatical geological phenomena in floetz rocks. I have developed my\r\n  conjectures on this subject in detail in a small memoir on primitive\r\n  porosity.[LX] According to the views I have more recently adopted, it\r\n  appears to me that the variously shattered and fissured earth, with\r\n  its fused interior, may long have continued in the primeval period, to\r\n  impart to its oxidised surface a high degree of temperature,\r\n  independent of its position with respect to the sun and to latitude.\r\n  What an influence would not, for instance, be exercised for ages to\r\n  come on the climate of Germany by an open fissure a thousand fathoms\r\n  in depth, extending from the Adriatic Gulf to the northern coast?\r\n  Although in the present condition of the earth, long-continued\r\n  radiation has almost entirely restored the stable equilibrium of\r\n  temperature first calculated by Fourier in his _Théorie analytique de\r\n  la Chaleur_, and the outer atmosphere is now only brought into direct\r\n  communication with the molten interior of the earth, by means of the\r\n  insignificant openings of a few volcanoes; yet in the primitive\r\n  condition of our planet, this interior emitted hot streams of air into\r\n  the atmosphere through the various clefts and fissures formed by the\r\n  frequently recurring foldings (or corrugations) of the mountain\r\n  strata. This emission was wholly independent of latitude. Every newly\r\n  formed planet must thus in its earliest condition have regulated its\r\n  own temperature, which was, however, subsequently changed and\r\n  determined by its position in relation to the central body, the sun.\r\n  The moon’s surface also exhibits traces of this reaction of the\r\n  interior upon the crust.\r\n\r\nFootnote 81:\r\n\r\n  p. 218—“_The mountain-declivities of the most southern parts of\r\n  Mexico_.”\r\n\r\n  The spherical greenstone in the mountain district of Guanaxuato is\r\n  perfectly similar to that of the Fichtelberg in Franconia. Both form\r\n  grotesque domes, which break through and are superimposed on\r\n  transition argillaceous schists. In the same manner pearl-stone,\r\n  porphyritic schist, trachyte, and pitch-stone porphyry present\r\n  analogous forms in the Mexican mountains, near Cinapecuaro and Moran,\r\n  in Hungary, Bohemia, and in Northern Asia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  p. 220—“_The Colossal Dragon-tree of Orotava_.”\r\n\r\n  This colossal dragon-tree (Dracæna draco) stands in the garden of M.\r\n  Franqui, in the little town of Orotava, called formerly Taoro, one of\r\n  the most charming spots in the world. In June, 1799, when we ascended\r\n  the Peak of Teneriffe, we found that this enormous tree measured 48\r\n  feet in circumference. Our measurement was made at several feet above\r\n  the root. Nearer to the ground Le Dru found it nearly 79 feet. Sir G.\r\n  Staunton asserts that at an elevation of ten feet from the ground, its\r\n  diameter is still 12 feet. The height of the tree is not much more\r\n  than 69 feet. According to tradition it would appear that this tree\r\n  was venerated by the Guanches (as was the ash-tree of Ephesus by the\r\n  Greeks, the Plantain of Lydia, which Xerxes decorated with ornaments,\r\n  also the sacred Banyan-tree of Ceylon), and that in the year 1402,\r\n  which was the period of Béthencourt’s first expedition, it was as\r\n  large and as hollow as in the present day. When it is remembered that\r\n  the dragon-tree is everywhere of very slow growth, we may conclude\r\n  that the one at Orotava is of extreme antiquity. Berthollet says, in\r\n  his description of Teneriffe, “On comparing the young dragon-trees\r\n  which grows near this colossal tree, the calculations we are led to\r\n  make on the age of the latter strike the mind with astonishment.”[LY]\r\n  The Dragon-tree has been cultivated from the most ancient times in the\r\n  Canary isles, in Madeira, and Porto Santo, and that accurate observer,\r\n  Leopold von Buch, found it growing wild near Iguesti in Teneriffe. Its\r\n  original habitat is not therefore the East Indies, as has long been\r\n  believed; and its appearance does not afford any refutation of the\r\n  opinion of those who regard the Guanches as a wholly isolated\r\n  primitive Atlantic race, having no intercourse with African or Asiatic\r\n  nations: The form of the _Dracænæ_ is repeated on the southern\r\n  extremity of Africa, in the Isle of Bourbon, in China, and in New\r\n  Zealand. In these remotely distant regions we recognise species of the\r\n  same genus, but none are to be found in the New Continent, where this\r\n  form is supplied by the Yucca. The _Dracæna borealis_ of Aiton is a\r\n  true _Convallaria_, the nature of both being perfectly identical.[LZ]\r\n\r\n  I have given a representation, in the last plate of the Picturesque\r\n  Atlas of my American journey,[MA] of the dragon-tree of Orotava, taken\r\n  from a drawing made in 1776 by F. d’Ozonne, and which I found among\r\n  the posthumous papers of the celebrated Borda, in the still unprinted\r\n  journal entrusted to me by the Dépôt de la Marine, and from which I\r\n  have borrowed important astronomically-determined geographical, data\r\n  besides many barometrical and trigonometrical notices.[MB] The\r\n  measurement of the dragon-tree in the Villa Franqui was made in\r\n  Borda’s first voyage with Pingré in 1771, and not in the second, made\r\n  1776 with Varela. It is asserted, that in the fifteenth century,\r\n  during the early periods of the Norman and Spanish conquests, mass was\r\n  performed at a small altar erected in the hollow trunk of this tree.\r\n  Unfortunately, the Dracæna of Orotava lost one side of its leafy top\r\n  in the storm of the 21st of July, 1819. There is a fine large English\r\n  copper-plate engraving, which gives an exceedingly true representation\r\n  of the present condition of the tree.\r\n\r\n  The monumental character of these colossal living forms, and the\r\n  impression of reverence which they have created among all nations,\r\n  have led, in modern times, to a more careful study of the numerical\r\n  determination of their age, and of the size of their trunks. The\r\n  results of such investigations induced the elder Decandolle, (the\r\n  author of the important treatise, entitled _De la Longévité des\r\n  Arbres_,) Endlicher, Unger, and other distinguished botanists to\r\n  conjecture, that the age of many existing vegetable forms may extend\r\n  to the earliest historical times, if not to the records of the Nile,\r\n  at least to those of Greece and Italy. In the _Bibliothèque\r\n  Universelle de Genève_ (t. xlvii. 1831, p. 50) we find the following\r\n  passage: “Numerous examples seem to confirm the idea, that there still\r\n  exist, on our planet, trees of a prodigious antiquity—the witnesses,\r\n  perhaps, of one or more of its latest physical revolutions. If we\r\n  consider a tree as the combination of as many individual forms as\r\n  there have been buds developed on its surface, one cannot be surprised\r\n  if the aggregate resulting from the continual addition of new buds to\r\n  the older ones, should not necessarily have any fixed termination to\r\n  its existence.” In the same manner, Agardh says: “If in each solar\r\n  year new parts be formed in the plant, and the older hardened ones be\r\n  replaced by new parts capable of conducting sap, we have a type of\r\n  growth limited by external causes alone.” He ascribes the short\r\n  duration of the life of herbaceous plants, “to the preponderance of\r\n  the production of blossoms and fruit over the formation of leaves.”\r\n  Unfruitfulness in a plant insures a prolongation of its life.\r\n  Endlicher adduces the instance of an individual plant of Medicago\r\n  sativa, var. β versicolor, which lived eighty years because it bore no\r\n  fruit.[MC]\r\n\r\n  To the dragon-trees, which, notwithstanding the gigantic development\r\n  of their closed vascular bundles, must be classed, in respect to their\r\n  floral parts, in the same natural family as Asparagus and the garden\r\n  onion, belongs the Adansonia, (the monkey bread-tree, _Baobab_),\r\n  undoubtedly among the largest and most ancient inhabitants of our\r\n  planet. In the earliest voyages of discovery made by Catalans and\r\n  Portuguese, the sailors were accustomed to carve their names on these\r\n  two species of trees; not always from a mere wish of perpetuating\r\n  their memory, but also as “marcos,” or signs of possession, and of the\r\n  rights which nations assume in virtue of first discovery. The\r\n  Portuguese mariners often selected for carving on the trees, as a\r\n  “marco,” or mark of possession, the elegant French motto _talent de\r\n  bien faire_, so frequently employed by the Infante Don Henrique, the\r\n  Discoverer. Thus Manuel de Faria y Sousa says expressly;[MD] “Era uso\r\n  de los primeros Navegantes de dexar inscrito el motto del Infante,\r\n  _talent de bien faire_, en la corteza de los arboles.”[ME] (It was the\r\n  custom of the early navigators to inscribe the motto of the Infante in\r\n  the bark of the trees.)\r\n\r\n  The above-named motto, cut on the bark of two trees by Portuguese\r\n  navigators in the year 1435, and therefore twenty-eight years before\r\n  the death of the Infante Don Henrique, Duke of Viseo, is singularly\r\n  connected, in the history of discoveries, with the discussions that\r\n  have arisen from a comparison of Vespucci’s fourth voyage with that of\r\n  Gonzalo Coelho (1503). Vespucci relates, that the Admiral’s ship of\r\n  Coelho’s squadron was wrecked on an island which was sometimes\r\n  supposed to be that of San Fernando Noronha; sometimes, Peñedo de San\r\n  Pedro; and sometimes, the problematical island of St. Matthew. The\r\n  last-named island was discovered on the 15th of October, 1525, by\r\n  Garcia Jofre de Loaysa in 2½ south lat., in the meridian of Cape\r\n  Palmas, and almost in the Gulf of Guinea. He remained there eighteen\r\n  days at anchor, and found crosses, orange-trees that had become wild,\r\n  and two trunks of trees having inscriptions that bore the date of\r\n  ninety years back.[MF] I have in another place,[MG] in an inquiry\r\n  regarding the trustworthiness of Amerigo Vespucci, more fully\r\n  considered this problem.\r\n\r\n  The oldest description of the Baobab (Adansonia digitata) is that of\r\n  the Venetian, Aloysius Cadamosto. (whose real name was Alvise da Ca da\r\n  Mosto) in 1454. He found at the mouth of the Senegal. (where he joined\r\n  Antoniotto Usodimare), trunks, whose circumference he estimated at 17\r\n  fathoms, or 112 feet.[MH] He might have compared them to dragon-trees,\r\n  which he had already seen. Perrottet says,[MI] that he had seen\r\n  monkey-bread fruit trees, which had a diameter of about thirty-two\r\n  feet, with a height of only from seventy to eighty-five feet. The same\r\n  dimensions had been given by Adanson in his voyage, 1748. The largest\r\n  trunks of the monkey bread-fruit trees, which he himself saw, in 1749,\r\n  some on one of the small Magdalena islands near Cape de Verd, and\r\n  others at the mouth of the Senegal, were from 26 to nearly 29 feet in\r\n  diameter, with a height of little more than 70 feet, and a top\r\n  measuring upwards of 180 feet across. Adanson, however, makes the\r\n  remark that other travellers had found trunks having a diameter of\r\n  about 32 feet.[MJ] French and Dutch sailors had carved their names on\r\n  the trunks in characters six inches in length. One of these\r\n  inscriptions was of the fifteenth century,[MK] while all the others\r\n  were of the sixteenth. From the depth of the cuts, which are covered\r\n  with new layers of wood,[ML] and from a comparison of the thickness of\r\n  trunks, whose various ages were known, Adanson computed the age of\r\n  trees having a diameter of 32 feet at 5150 years.[MM] He however\r\n  cautiously subjoins the following remarks, in a quaint mode of\r\n  spelling which I do not alter: “le calcul de l’aje de chake couche n’a\r\n  pas d’exactitude géometrike.” In the village of Grand Galarques, also\r\n  in Senegambia, the negroes have adorned the entrance of a hollow\r\n  Baobab with carvings cut out of wood still green. The inner cavity\r\n  serves as a place of general meeting in which the community debate on\r\n  their interests. This hall reminds us of the hollow (specus) in the\r\n  interior of a plantain in Lycia, in which the Roman ex-consul,\r\n  Lucinius Mutianus, entertained twenty-one guests. Pliny (xii. 3) gives\r\n  to a cavity of this kind the somewhat ample breadth of eighty Roman\r\n  feet. The Baobab was seen by René Caillié in the valley of the Niger\r\n  near Jenne, by Cailliaud in Nubia, and by Wilhelm Peters along the\r\n  whole eastern coast of Africa, where this tree, which is called\r\n  _Mulapa_, _i.e._ _Nlapa-tree_, or more correctly _muti-nlapa_,\r\n  advances as far as Lourenzo Marques, almost to 26° south lat. The\r\n  oldest and thickest trunks seen by Peters “measured from 60 to 75 feet\r\n  in circumference.” Although Cadamosto observed, in the fifteenth\r\n  century, _eminentia non quadrat magnitudini_; and although\r\n  Golberry[MN] found, in the “Vallée des deux Gagnacks,” trunks only 64\r\n  feet in height whose diameter was 36 feet, this disproportion between\r\n  thickness and height must not be assumed to be general. “Very old\r\n  trees,” says the learned traveller, Peters, “lose their crowns by\r\n  gradual decay, while they continue to increase in circumference. On\r\n  the eastern coast of Africa one not unfrequently meets with trees\r\n  having a diameter of more than 10 feet which reach the height of\r\n  nearly 70 feet.”\r\n\r\n  While therefore the bold calculations of Adanson and Perrottet assign\r\n  to the Adansonias measured by them, an age of 5150 or even 6000 years,\r\n  which would make them coeval with the builders of the Pyramids, or\r\n  even with Menes, and would place them in an epoch when the Southern\r\n  Cross was still visible in Northern Germany;[MO] the more certain\r\n  estimations yielded by annular rings, and by the relation found to\r\n  exist between the thickness of the layer of wood and the duration of\r\n  growth, give us, on the other hand, shorter periods for our temperate\r\n  northern zone. Decandolle finds that of all European species of trees,\r\n  the yew attains the greatest age; and according to his calculations,\r\n  30 centuries must be assigned as the age of the _Taxus baccata_ of\r\n  Braburn in Kent, from 25 to 26 to the Scotch yew of Fortingal, and 14½\r\n  and 12 respectively to those of Crowhurst in Surrey and Ripon\r\n  (Fountains Abbey) in Yorkshire.[MP] Endlicher remarks that “another\r\n  yew-tree in the churchyard of Grasford, North Wales, which measures\r\n  more than 50 feet in girth below the branches, is more than 1400 years\r\n  old, whilst one in Derbyshire is estimated at 2096 years. In Lithuania\r\n  linden trees have been felled which measured 87 feet round, and in\r\n  which 815 annular rings have been counted.”[MQ] In the temperate zone\r\n  of the southern hemisphere some species of the Eucalyptus attain an\r\n  enormous girth, and as they at the same time attain a height of nearly\r\n  250 feet, they afford a singular contrast to our yew trees, which are\r\n  colossal only in thickness. Mr. Backhouse found in Emu Bay, on the\r\n  shore of Van Diemen’s Land, Eucalyptus trunks which, with a\r\n  circumference of 70 feet at the base, measured as much as 50 feet at a\r\n  little more than 5 feet from the ground.[MR]\r\n\r\n  It was not Malpighi, as has been generally asserted, but the\r\n  intellectual Michel Montaigne, who had the merit of first showing, in\r\n  1581, in his _Voyage en Italie_, the relation that exists between the\r\n  annual rings and the age of the tree.[MS] An intelligent artisan,\r\n  engaged in the preparation of astronomical instruments, first drew\r\n  Montaigne’s attention to the significance of the annual rings,\r\n  asserting that the part of the trunk directed towards the north had\r\n  narrower rings. Jean Jacques Rousseau entertained the same opinion;\r\n  and his Emile, when he loses himself in the forest, is made to direct\r\n  his course in accordance with the deposition of the layers of wood.\r\n  Recent phyto-anatomical observations[MT] teach us, however, that the\r\n  acceleration of vegetation as well as the remission of growth, and the\r\n  varying production of the circles of the ligneous bundles (annual\r\n  deposits) from the cambium cells, depend on other influences than\r\n  position with respect to the quarter of the heavens.\r\n\r\n  Trees which in the case of some examples attain a diameter of more\r\n  than 20 feet, and an age of many centuries, belong to very different\r\n  natural families. We may here instance Baobabs, Dragon trees, various\r\n  species of Eucalyptus, Taxodium distichum. (Rich.,) Pinus Lambertiana.\r\n  (Douglasii,) Hymenæa Courbaril, Cæsalpinieæ, Bombax, Swietenia\r\n  Mahagoni, the Banyan tree (_Ficus religiosa_), Liriodendron\r\n  tulipifera(?), Platanus orientalis, and our Lindens, Oaks, and Yews.\r\n  The celebrated Taxodium distichon, the Ahuahuete of the Mexicans\r\n  (_Cupressus disticha_, Linn., _Schubertia disticha_, Mirbel), of Santa\r\n  Maria del Tule, in the State of Oaxaca, has not a diameter of 60 feet,\r\n  as stated by Decandolle, but exactly 40½ feet.[MU] The two beautiful\r\n  Ahuahuetes which I have frequently seen at Chapoltepec (growing in\r\n  what was probably once a garden or pleasure ground of Montezuma)\r\n  measure, according to the instructive account in Burkardt’s travels\r\n  (bd. i. s. 268) only 36 and 38 feet in circumference, and not in\r\n  diameter, as has often been erroneously maintained. The Buddhists of\r\n  Ceylon venerate the colossal trunk of the sacred fig-tree of\r\n  Anurahdepura. The Banyan, which takes root by its branches, often\r\n  attains a thickness of 30 feet, and forms, as Onesicritus truly\r\n  expresses himself, a leafy roof resembling a many-pillared tent.[MV]\r\n  On the Bombax Ceiba see early notices from the time of Columbus in\r\n  Bembo.[MW]\r\n\r\n  Among those oak trees which have been very accurately measured, the\r\n  largest in Europe is undoubtedly the one near Saintes on the road to\r\n  Cozes, in the Department de la Charente inférieure. This tree, which\r\n  has an elevation of 64 feet, measures very nearly 30 feet in diameter\r\n  near the ground, while 5 feet higher up it is nearly 23 feet, and\r\n  where the main branches begin more than 6 feet. A little room, from 10\r\n  feet 8 inches to 12 feet 9 inches in width and 9 feet 7 inches in\r\n  height, has been cleared in the dead part of the trunk, and a\r\n  semi-circular bench cut within it from the green wood. A window gives\r\n  light to the interior, and hence the walls of this little room, which\r\n  is closed by a door, are gracefully clothed with ferns and lichens.\r\n  From the size of a small piece of wood that had been cut out over the\r\n  door, and in which two hundred ligneous rings were counted, the age of\r\n  the oak of Saintes must be estimated at 1800 or 2000 years.[MX]\r\n\r\n  With respect to the rose-tree (_Rosa canina_) reputed to be a thousand\r\n  years old, which grows in the crypt of the Cathedral of Hildesheim, I\r\n  learn from accurate information, based on authentic records, for which\r\n  I am indebted to the kindness of the Stadtgerichts-Assessor Römer,\r\n  that the main stem only has an age of eight hundred years. A legend\r\n  connects this rose-tree with a vow of the first founder of the\r\n  cathedral, Louis the Pious; and a document of the eleventh century\r\n  says, “that when Bishop Hezilo rebuilt the cathedral, which had been\r\n  burnt down, he enclosed the roots of the rose-tree within a vault\r\n  still remaining, raised on the latter the walls of the crypt, which\r\n  was re-consecrated in 1061, and spread the branches of the rose-tree\r\n  over its sides.” The stem, still living, is nearly 27 feet in height,\r\n  and only 2 inches thick, and spreads across a width of 82 feet over\r\n  the outer wall of the eastern crypt. It is undoubtedly of very\r\n  considerable antiquity, and well worthy of the renown it has so long\r\n  enjoyed throughout Germany.\r\n\r\n  If excessive size, in point of organic development, may in general be\r\n  regarded as a proof of a long protraction of life, special attention\r\n  is due, among the thalassophytes of the submarine vegetable world, to\r\n  a species of fucus, _Macrocystis pyrifera_, Agardh (_Fucus\r\n  giganteus_). This marine plant attains, according to Captain Cook and\r\n  George Forster, a length of 360 feet, and exceeds therefore the height\r\n  of the loftiest Coniferous trees, not excepting _Sequoia gigantea_,\r\n  Endl. (_Taxodium sempervirens_, Hook, and Arnott) of California.[MY]\r\n  Captain Fitz-Roy has confirmed this statement.[MZ] Macrocystis\r\n  pyrifera grows from 64° south lat. to 45° north lat., as far as the\r\n  Bay of San Francisco on the north-west coast of the New Continent;\r\n  indeed Joseph Hooker believes that this species of Fucus advances as\r\n  far as Kamtschatka. In the waters of the Antarctic seas it is even\r\n  seen floating between the pack-ice.[NA] The cellular band and\r\n  thread-like structures of the Macrocystis (which are attached to the\r\n  bottom of the sea by an adhesive organ resembling a claw) seem to be\r\n  limited in their length by accidental disturbing causes alone.\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  p. 220—“_Phanerogamic plants already recorded in herbariums_.”\r\n\r\n  Three questions must be carefully distinguished from one another: 1.\r\n  How many species of plants have been described in printed works? 2.\r\n  How many of those discovered—that is to say included in\r\n  herbariums—still remain undescribed? 3. How many species probably\r\n  exist on the surface of the earth? Murray’s edition of the Linnæan\r\n  system contains, including cryptogamic plants, only 10,042 species.\r\n  Willdenow, in his edition of the _Species Plantarum_ from 1797 to\r\n  1807, has described as many as 17,457 species of phanerogamia,\r\n  reckoning from Monandria to Polygamia diœcia. If to these we add 3000\r\n  species of cryptogamic plants, we shall bring the number as given by\r\n  Willdenow to 20,000. More recent investigations have shown how far\r\n  this estimate of the species described, and of those preserved in\r\n  herbariums, falls short of the truth. Robert Brown[NB] first\r\n  enumerated above 37,000 phanerogamia, and I at that time attempted to\r\n  describe the distribution of 44,000 species of phanerogamic and\r\n  cryptogamic plants, over the different portions of the world already\r\n  explored.[NC] Decandolle finds, on comparing Persoon’s _Enchiridium_\r\n  with his _Universal System divided into twelve families_, that more\r\n  than 56,000 species of plants may be enumerated from the writings of\r\n  botanists and European herbariums.[ND] If we consider how many new\r\n  species have been described by travellers since that time, (my\r\n  expedition alone afforded 3600 of the 5800 collected species of\r\n  equinoctial plants), and if we bear in mind that there are assuredly\r\n  upwards of 25,000 phanerogamic plants, cultivated in all the different\r\n  botanical gardens, we shall soon see how much Decandolle’s estimate is\r\n  below the truth. From our complete ignorance of the interior of South\r\n  America (Mato-Grosso, Paraguay, the eastern declivity of the Andes,\r\n  Santa-Cruz de la Sierra, and all the countries lying between the\r\n  Orinoco, the Rio Negro, the Amazon, and Puruz), of Africa, of\r\n  Madagascar, and Borneo, and of Central and Eastern Asia, the idea\r\n  involuntarily presents itself to the mind that we are not yet\r\n  acquainted with one third, or probably even with one fifth part of the\r\n  plants existing on the earth. Drège has collected 7092 phanerogamic\r\n  species in Southern Africa alone; and he believes that the flora of\r\n  that region consists of more than 11,000 phanerogamic species, seeing\r\n  that in Germany and Switzerland, on an equal area (192,000 square\r\n  miles,) Koch has described only 3300, and Decandolle only 3645\r\n  phanerogamia in France. I would here also instance the new genera,\r\n  consisting partly of high forest trees, which are still being\r\n  discovered in the neighbourhood of large commercial towns in the\r\n  lesser Antilles, although they have been visited by Europeans for the\r\n  last three hundred years. Such considerations, which I purpose\r\n  developing more fully at the close of this illustration, seem to\r\n  verify the ancient myth of the Zend-Avesta, that “the creating\r\n  primeval force called forth 120,000 vegetable forms from the sacred\r\n  blood of the bull.”\r\n\r\n  If therefore no direct scientific solution can be afforded to the\r\n  question, how many vegetable forms—leafless cryptogamia (water algæ,\r\n  fungi, and lichens), characeæ, liverworts, foliaceous mosses,\r\n  marsilaceæ, lycopodiaceæ, and ferns—exist on the dry land, and in the\r\n  wide basin of the sea, in the present condition of the organic\r\n  terrestrial life of our planet, it only remains for us to employ an\r\n  approximative method for ascertaining with some degree of probability\r\n  certain “extreme limits” (numerical data of minima). Since the year\r\n  1815, I have, in my arithmetical considerations on the geography of\r\n  plants, calculated the numbers expressing the ratio which the\r\n  aggregate of species of different natural families bears to the whole\r\n  mass of the phanerogamia in those countries where the latter is\r\n  sufficiently determined. Robert Brown,[NE] the greatest botanist of\r\n  our age, had, prior to my researches, already determined the numerical\r\n  proportion of the principal divisions of vegetable forms, as for\r\n  instance of acotyledons (_Agamæ_, cryptogamic or cellular plants) to\r\n  cotyledons (_Phanerogamia_, or vascular plants), and of monocotyledons\r\n  (_Endogenæ_) to dicotyledons (_Exogenæ_). He finds the ratio of\r\n  monocotyledons to dicotyledons in the tropical zone as in the\r\n  proportion of 1 to 5, and in the frigid zone, in the parallels of 60°\r\n  north, and 55° south lat. as 1 to 2½.[NF] The absolute numbers of the\r\n  species are compared together in the three great divisions of the\r\n  vegetable kingdom, according to the method developed in Brown’s work.\r\n  I was the first who passed from these principal divisions to the\r\n  individual families, and considered the number of the species\r\n  contained in each, in their ratio to the whole mass of phanerogamia\r\n  belonging to one zone.[NG]\r\n\r\n  The numerical relations of the forms of plants, and the laws observed\r\n  in their geographical distribution, admit of being considered from two\r\n  very different points of view. When we study plants in their\r\n  arrangement according to natural families, without regard to their\r\n  geographical distribution, the question arises: What are the\r\n  fundamental forms or types of organization, in accordance with which\r\n  the greater number of their species are formed? Are there more\r\n  Glumaceæ than Compositæ on the earth’s surface? Do these two orders of\r\n  plants combined, constitute one-fourth of the phanerogamia? What\r\n  numerical relation do monocotyledons bear to dicotyledons? These are\r\n  questions of general phytology, a science that investigates the\r\n  organization of plants and their mutual connection, and therefore has\r\n  reference to the now existing state of vegetation.\r\n\r\n  If, on the other hand, the species of plants that have been connected\r\n  together according to their structural analogy, are considered not\r\n  abstractedly, but in accordance with their climatic relations, and\r\n  their distribution over the earth’s surface, these questions acquire a\r\n  totally different interest. We then examine what families of plants\r\n  predominate in the torrid zone more than towards the polar circle over\r\n  other phanerogamia? We inquire, whether the Compositæ are more\r\n  numerous in the new than in the old world, under equal geographical\r\n  latitudes or between equal isothermal lines? Whether the forms which\r\n  gradually lose their predominance in advancing from the equator to the\r\n  poles, follow a similar law of decrease in ascending mountains\r\n  situated in the equatorial region? Whether the relations of the\r\n  different families to the whole mass of the phanerogamia differ under\r\n  equal isothermal lines in the temperate zones on either side of the\r\n  equator? These questions belong to the geography of plants properly so\r\n  called, and are connected with the most important problems that can be\r\n  presented by meteorology and terrestrial physics. Thus the\r\n  predominance of certain families of plants determines the character of\r\n  a landscape, and whether the aspect of the country is desolate or\r\n  luxuriant, or smiling and majestic. Grasses, forming extended\r\n  Savannahs, or the abundance of fruit-yielding palms, or social\r\n  coniferous trees, have respectively exerted a powerful influence on\r\n  the material condition, manners, and character of nations, and on the\r\n  more or less rapid development of their prosperity.\r\n\r\n  In studying the geographical distribution of forms, we may consider\r\n  the species, genera, and natural families of plants separately. A\r\n  single species, especially among social plants, frequently covers an\r\n  extensive tract of land. Thus we have in the north, Pine or Fir\r\n  forests, and Heaths (_ericeta_); in Spain, Cistus groves; and in\r\n  tropical America, collections of one and the same species of Cactus,\r\n  Croton, Brathys, or Bambusa Guadua. It is interesting to study more\r\n  closely these relations of individual increase, and of organic\r\n  development; and here we may inquire, what species produces the\r\n  greatest number of individuals in one certain zone; or, merely what\r\n  are the families to which the predominating species belong in\r\n  different climates. In a very high northern latitude, where the\r\n  Compositæ and the Ferns stand in the ratios of 1 : 13 and 1 : 25 to\r\n  the sum of all the phanerogamia (_i. e._, where these ratios are found\r\n  by dividing the sum total of all phanerogamia by the number of species\r\n  included in the family of the Compositæ, or in that of the Ferns); one\r\n  single species of Fern may, however, cover ten times more space than\r\n  all the species of the Compositæ taken together. In this case the\r\n  Ferns predominate over the Compositæ by their mass, and by the number\r\n  of the individuals belonging to the same species of Pteris, or\r\n  Polypodium; but they will not be found to predominate, if we only\r\n  compare the number of the different specific forms of the Filices, and\r\n  of the Compositæ, with the sum total of all Phanerogamia. As,\r\n  therefore, multiplication of plants does not follow the same laws in\r\n  all species, and as all do not produce an equal number of individuals,\r\n  the quotients obtained by dividing the sum of all phanerogamic plants\r\n  by the species of one family, do not _alone_ determine the leading\r\n  features impressed on the landscape, or the physiognomy of nature\r\n  peculiar to different regions of the earth. If the attention of the\r\n  travelling botanist be arrested by the frequent repetition of the same\r\n  species, by its mass, and the uniformity of vegetation thus produced,\r\n  it will be still more forcibly arrested by the infrequency of many\r\n  other species useful to man. In tropical regions, where the Rubiaceæ,\r\n  Myrtles, Leguminosæ, or Terebinthaceæ, compose the forests, one is\r\n  astonished to meet with so few trees of Cinchona, or of certain\r\n  species of mahogany (_Swietenia_), of Hæmatoxylon, Styrax, or balsamic\r\n  Myroxylon. I would also here refer to the scanty and detached\r\n  occurrence of the precious febrifuge-bark trees (species of Cinchona)\r\n  which I had an opportunity of observing on the declivity of the\r\n  elevated plains of Bogota and Popayan, and in the neighbourhood of\r\n  Loxa, in descending towards the unhealthy valley of the Catamayo, and\r\n  to the river Amazon. The _febrifuge-bark hunters_ (Cazadores de\r\n  Cascarilla), as those Indians and Mestizoes are called at Loxa, who\r\n  each year collect the most efficacious of all the medicinal barks, the\r\n  _Cinchona Condaminea_, among the lonely mountains of Caxanuma,\r\n  Uritusinga, and Rumisitana, undergo considerable danger in climbing to\r\n  the summits of the highest forest-trees, in order to obtain an\r\n  extended view, from which they may distinguish the scattered, slender,\r\n  and aspiring trunks of the Cinchona, by the reddish tint of their\r\n  large leaves. The mean temperature of this important forest region\r\n  (between 4° and 4½° south lat.) varies from 60° to 68° Fahr., at an\r\n  absolute height of from 6400 to 8000 feet above the level of the\r\n  sea.[NH]\r\n\r\n  In considering the distribution of species, we may also, independently\r\n  of individual multiplication and mass, compare together the absolute\r\n  number which belong to each family. Such a mode of comparison, which\r\n  was employed by Decandolle,[NI] has been extended by Kunth to more\r\n  than 3300 of the species of Compositæ with which we are at present\r\n  acquainted. It does not show what family preponderates by individual\r\n  mass, or by the number of its species, over other phanerogamic forms,\r\n  but it simply indicates how many of the species of one and the same\r\n  family are indigenous in any one country or portion of the earth. The\r\n  results of this method are, on the whole, more exact, because they are\r\n  obtained by a careful study of the separate families, without\r\n  requiring that the whole number of the phanerogamia of every country\r\n  should be known. Thus, for instance, the most varied forms of Ferns\r\n  are found in the tropical zone, each genus presenting the greatest\r\n  number of species in the temperate, humid, and shaded mountainous\r\n  parts of islands. While these species are less numerous in passing\r\n  from tropical regions to the temperate zone, their _absolute number_\r\n  diminishes still more in approaching nearer to the poles. Although the\r\n  frigid zone, as, for instance, Lapland, supports species of the\r\n  families which are best able to resist the cold, Ferns predominate\r\n  more over other phanerogamia in Lapland than either in France or\r\n  Germany, notwithstanding the absolute inferiority of the gross number\r\n  of ferns indigenous to the northern zone, when compared with other\r\n  countries. These relations are, in France and Germany, as ¹⁄₇₃ and\r\n  ¹⁄₇₁, while in Lapland they are as ¹⁄₂₅. These numerical relations\r\n  (obtained by dividing the sum total of all the phanerogamia of the\r\n  different floras by the species of each family) were published by me\r\n  in 1817, in my _Prolegomena de distributione geographica Plantarum_,\r\n  and corrected in accordance with the great works of Robert Brown, in\r\n  my Essay on the Distribution of Plants over the earth’s surface, which\r\n  I subsequently wrote in French. These relations, as we advance from\r\n  the equator towards the poles, necessarily vary from the ratios\r\n  obtained by a comparison of the absolute number of the different\r\n  species belonging to each family. We often see the value of the\r\n  fractions increase by the decrease of the denominator, whilst the\r\n  absolute number of the species is reduced. In the fractional method\r\n  which I have followed as the most applicable to questions relating to\r\n  the geography of plants, there are two variable quantities; for in\r\n  passing from one isothermal line to another, we do not find the sum\r\n  total of the phanerogamia change in the same proportion as the number\r\n  of the species of one particular family.\r\n\r\n  In proceeding from the consideration of these species to that of the\r\n  divisions established in the natural system according to an ideal\r\n  series of abstractions, we may direct our attention to genera or\r\n  races, to families, or even to still higher classes of division. There\r\n  are some genera, and even whole families, which exclusively belong to\r\n  certain zones; not merely because they can only thrive under a special\r\n  combination of climatic relations, but also because they first sprang\r\n  up within very circumscribed localities, and have been checked in\r\n  their migrations. The larger number of genera and families have,\r\n  however, their representatives in all regions of the earth, and at all\r\n  elevations. The earliest inquiries into the distribution of vegetable\r\n  forms had reference to genera alone, and are to be found in the\r\n  valuable work of Treviranus.[NJ] This method is, however, less\r\n  appropriate for yielding general results, than that which compares the\r\n  number of the species of each family, or the great leading divisions\r\n  (acotyledons, monocotyledons, and dicotyledons), with the sum total of\r\n  the phanerogamia. In the frigid zone, the variety of forms, or the\r\n  number of the genera, does not decrease in an equal degree with that\r\n  of the species, there being in these regions relatively more genera\r\n  and fewer species.[NK] The case is almost the same on the summits of\r\n  high mountain-chains, where are sheltered individual members of many\r\n  different genera which one would be disposed to regard as belonging\r\n  exclusively to the vegetation of the plain.\r\n\r\n  I have deemed it expedient to indicate the different points of view\r\n  from which the laws of the distribution of vegetable forms may be\r\n  considered. It is only when these points of view are confounded\r\n  together, that we meet with contradictions, which have been unjustly\r\n  attributed to uncertainty of observation.[NL] When expressions like\r\n  the following are employed: “This form, or this family diminishes as\r\n  it approaches towards the cold zone,” or “the true habitat of this\r\n  form is in such or such a parallel of latitude;” or “this is a\r\n  southern form,” or, again, “it predominates in the temperate zone;” it\r\n  should be definitely stated whether reference is made to the absolute\r\n  number of the species, and the proportion of their predominance\r\n  according to the increase or decrease of latitude; or whether the\r\n  meaning conveyed is, that a family, when compared with the whole\r\n  number of the phanerogamia of a flora, predominates over other\r\n  families of plants. The impression conveyed to the mind of the\r\n  predominance of forms, depends literally on the conception of relative\r\n  quantity.\r\n\r\n  Terrestrial physics have their numerical elements as well as the\r\n  cosmical system, and it is only by the united labours of botanical\r\n  travellers that we can hope gradually to arrive at a knowledge of the\r\n  laws which determine the geographical and climatic distribution of\r\n  vegetable forms. I have already observed that in the temperate zone of\r\n  the northern hemisphere, the Compositæ (Synanthereæ) and the Glumaceæ\r\n  (in which latter division I place the three families of the Gramineæ,\r\n  the Cyperoideæ, and the Juncaceæ) constitute the fourth part of all\r\n  phanerogamia. The following numerical relations are the result of my\r\n  investigations for seven great families of the vegetable kingdom in\r\n  one and the same temperate zone:\r\n\r\n Glumaceæ                                       ⅛   (Grasses alone ¹⁄₁₂)\r\n Compositæ                                      ⅛\r\n Leguminosæ                                    ¹⁄₁₈\r\n Labiatæ                                       ¹⁄₂₄\r\n Umbelliferæ                                   ¹⁄₄₀\r\n Amentaceæ (Cupuliferæ, Betulineæ, and\r\n   Salicineæ)                                  ¹⁄₄₅\r\n Cruciferæ                                     ¹⁄₁₉\r\n\r\n  The forms of organic beings are reciprocally dependent on one another.\r\n  Such is the unity of nature, that these forms limit each other in\r\n  obedience to laws which are probably connected with long periods of\r\n  time. When we have ascertained the number of the species on any\r\n  particular part of the earth’s surface belonging to one of the great\r\n  families of the Glumaceæ, the Leguminosæ, or the Compositæ, we may\r\n  with some degree of probability, form approximative conclusions\r\n  regarding the number of all the phanerogamia, as well as of the\r\n  species belonging to the other families of plants growing in the\r\n  country. The number of the Cyperoideæ determines that of the\r\n  Compositæ, and the number of the latter determines that of the\r\n  Leguminosæ; and these estimates, moreover, enable us to ascertain in\r\n  what classes and orders the Floras of a country are still incomplete,\r\n  teaching us what harvests may still be reaped in the respective\r\n  families, if we guard against confounding together very different\r\n  systems of vegetation.\r\n\r\n  The comparison of the numerical proportions of families in the\r\n  different zones which have as yet been well explored, has led me to a\r\n  knowledge of the laws which determine the numerical increase or\r\n  decrease of vegetable forms constituting a natural family, in\r\n  proceeding from the equator to the poles, when compared, for instance,\r\n  with the whole mass of phanerogamia peculiar to each zone. We must\r\n  here have regard not only to the direction, but also to the rapidity\r\n  or measure of the increase. We see the denominator of the fraction,\r\n  which expresses the ratio, increase or diminish. Thus, for instance,\r\n  the beautiful family of the Leguminosæ diminishes in proportion as it\r\n  recedes from the equinoctial zone to the north pole. If we find its\r\n  ratio for the torrid zone (from 0° to 10° of latitude) ⅒, we shall\r\n  have for the part of the temperate zone (lying between 45° and 52°)\r\n  ¹⁄₁₈, and for the frigid zone (between 67° and 70° lat.) only ¹⁄₃₅.\r\n  The direction followed by the great family of the Leguminosæ (viz.,\r\n  increase towards the equator) is also that of the Rubiaceæ, the\r\n  Euphorbiaceæ, and especially the Malvaceæ. On the other hand, the\r\n  Gramineæ and the Juncaceæ (the latter more than the former), the\r\n  Ericeæ, and Amentaceæ, diminish towards the torrid zone. The\r\n  Compositæ, Labiatæ, Umbelliferæ, and Cruciferæ, diminish from the\r\n  temperate zone towards the pole and the equator, and the two latter\r\n  families most rapidly in the direction of the equatorial region;\r\n  whilst in the temperate zone the Cruciferæ are three times more\r\n  abundant in Europe than in the United States of North America. In\r\n  Greenland the Labiatæ are reduced to only one species, and the\r\n  Umbelliferæ to two, while the whole number of the phanerogamia still\r\n  amounts, according to Hornemann, to 315 species.\r\n\r\n  It must at the same time be observed that the development of plants of\r\n  different families, and the distribution of their forms, do not depend\r\n  alone on the geographical, or even on the isothermal latitude; the\r\n  quotients not being always equal on one and the same isothermal line\r\n  in the temperate zone, as for instance in the plains of America and in\r\n  those of the Old Continent. Within the tropics there is a very marked\r\n  difference between America, the East Indies, and the western coast of\r\n  Africa. The distribution of organic beings over the surface of the\r\n  earth does not depend solely on the great complication of thermic and\r\n  climatic relations, but also on geological causes which continue\r\n  almost wholly unknown to us, since they have been produced by the\r\n  original condition of the earth, and by catastrophes which have not\r\n  affected all parts of our planet simultaneously. The large\r\n  pachydermata are no longer found in the New Continent, while they\r\n  still exist under analogous climates in Asia and Africa. These\r\n  differences, instead of deterring us from the investigation of the\r\n  laws of nature, should rather stimulate us to study them in all their\r\n  intricate modifications.\r\n\r\n  The numerical laws of families, the frequently striking agreement\r\n  between the ratios, where the species constituting these families are\r\n  for the most part different, lead us into that mysterious obscurity\r\n  which envelopes everything connected with the fixing of organic types\r\n  in the different species of animals and plants, and with all that\r\n  refers to formation and development. I will take as examples two\r\n  neighbouring countries—France and Germany—which have both been long\r\n  since explored. In France many species of Gramineæ, Umbelliferæ,\r\n  Cruciferæ, Compositæ, Leguminosæ, and Labiatæ are wanting, which are\r\n  some of the commonest in Germany, and yet the ratios of these six\r\n  large families are almost identical in both countries. Their\r\n  relations, which I here give, are as follows:\r\n\r\n                      Families.   Germany. France.\r\n                     Gramineæ.      ¹⁄₁₃    ¹⁄₁₃\r\n                     Umbelliferæ.   ¹⁄₂₂    ¹⁄₂₁\r\n                     Cruciferæ.     ¹⁄₁₈    ¹⁄₁₉\r\n                     Compositæ.      ⅛        ⅐\r\n                     Leguminosæ.    ¹⁄₁₈    ¹⁄₁₆\r\n                     Labiatæ.       ¹⁄₂₆    ¹⁄₂₄\r\n\r\n  This correspondence in the number of species of one family compared to\r\n  the whole mass of the phanerogamia of Germany and France would not\r\n  exist, if the absent German species were not replaced in France by\r\n  other types of the same families. Those who delight in conjectures\r\n  respecting the gradual transformation of species, and who regard the\r\n  different parrots, peculiar to islands situated near each other, as\r\n  merely transformed species, will ascribe the remarkable uniformity\r\n  presented by the above numerical ratios to a migration of the same\r\n  species, which having been altered by climatic influences, continuing\r\n  for thousands of years, appear to replace each other. But why have our\r\n  common Heath, (Calluna vulgaris,) and our Oaks not penetrated to the\r\n  east of the Ural Mountains, and passed from Europe to northern Asia?\r\n  Why is there no species of the genus Rosa in the southern, and\r\n  scarcely any Calceolaria in the northern hemisphere? These are points\r\n  that cannot be explained by peculiarities of temperature. The present\r\n  distribution of forms (fixed forms of organization) is no more\r\n  explained by thermal relations alone, than by the hypothesis of\r\n  migrations of plants radiating from certain central points. Thermal\r\n  relations are scarcely sufficient to explain the phenomenon why\r\n  certain species have fixed limits beyond which they cannot pass,\r\n  either in the plains towards the pole, or in vertical elevation on the\r\n  declivities of mountains. The cycle of vegetation of each species,\r\n  however different may be its duration, requires a certain minimum of\r\n  temperature to enable it to arrive at the full stage of its\r\n  development.[NM] But all the conditions necessary to the existence of\r\n  a plant, either within its natural sphere of distribution or\r\n  cultivation—such as geographical distance from the pole, and elevation\r\n  of the locality—are rendered still more complicated by the difficulty\r\n  of determining the beginning of the thermic cycle of vegetation; by\r\n  the influence which the unequal distribution of the same quantity of\r\n  heat among days and nights succeeding each other in groups, exerts on\r\n  the irritability, the progressive development, and the whole vital\r\n  process; and lastly, by the secondary influence of the hygrometric and\r\n  electric relations of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n  My investigations regarding the numerical laws of the distribution of\r\n  vegetable forms may, perhaps, at some future time, be applied\r\n  successfully to the different classes of vertebrate animals. The rich\r\n  collections of the Muséum d’histoire naturelle in the Jardin des\r\n  Plantes at Paris, contained in 1820, at a rough estimate, above 56,000\r\n  species of phanerogamic and cryptogamic plants in the herbariums,\r\n  44,000 insects (probably below the actual number, although they were\r\n  thus given me by Latreille), 2500 species of fishes, 700 reptiles,\r\n  4000 birds, and 500 mammalia. Europe possesses about 80 mammalia, 400\r\n  birds, and 30 reptiles; there are, therefore, five times as many birds\r\n  as mammalia in the northern temperate zone, (as there are in Europe\r\n  five times as many Compositæ as Amentaceæ and Coniferæ, and five times\r\n  as many Leguminosæ as Orchideæ and Euphorbiaceæ). In the southern\r\n  temperate zone the ratio of the Mammalia bears a sufficiently striking\r\n  accord with that of Birds, being as 1 : 4·3. Birds (and reptiles even\r\n  to a greater extent), increase more than mammalia in advancing towards\r\n  the torrid zone. We might be disposed to believe, from Cuvier’s\r\n  investigations, that this ratio was different in the earlier age of\r\n  our planet, and that the number of mammalia that perished by\r\n  convulsions of nature was much greater than that of birds. Latreille\r\n  has shown the different groups of insects that increase in advancing\r\n  towards the pole, or towards the equator, and Illiger has indicated\r\n  the native places of 3800 birds, according to the quarters of the\r\n  globe;—a far less instructive method than if they had been given\r\n  according to zones. We may easily comprehend how, on a given area, the\r\n  individuals of one class of plants or animals may limit each other’s\r\n  numbers, and how, after the long-continued contests and fluctuations\r\n  engendered by the requirements of nourishment and mode of life, a\r\n  condition of equilibrium may have been at length established; but the\r\n  causes which have determined their typical varieties, and have\r\n  circumscribed the sphere of the distribution of the forms themselves,\r\n  no less than the number of individuals of each form, are shrouded in\r\n  that impenetrable obscurity which still conceals from our view all\r\n  that relates to the beginning of things and the first appearance of\r\n  organic life.\r\n\r\n  If, therefore, as I have already observed at the beginning of this\r\n  illustration, we attempt to give an approximative estimate of the\r\n  _numerical limit_ (“le nombre limite” of the French mathematicians),\r\n  _below_ which we cannot place the sum of all the phanerogamia on the\r\n  surface of the earth; we shall find that the surest method will be by\r\n  comparing the known ratios of the families of plants with the number\r\n  of the species contained in our herbariums, or cultivated in large\r\n  botanical gardens. As I have just remarked, the herbariums of the\r\n  Jardin des Plantes at Paris were, in 1820, already estimated at 56,000\r\n  species. I will not hazard a conjecture as to the number that may be\r\n  contained in the herbariums of England, but the great Paris herbarium,\r\n  which Benjamin Delessert with the noblest disinterestedness has given\r\n  up to free and general use, was estimated, at the time of his death,\r\n  to contain 86,000 species, a number almost equal to that which\r\n  Lindley, even in 1835,[NN] regarded as the probable number of all the\r\n  species existing “on the whole earth.” Few herbariums are numbered\r\n  with care, according to a complete, severe, and methodical separation\r\n  of the different varieties; while, moreover, we often find no\r\n  inconsiderable number of plants wanting in the large so-called general\r\n  herbariums, which are contained in some of the smaller ones. Dr.\r\n  Klotzsch estimates the whole number of Phanerogamic plants in the\r\n  Great Royal Herbarium at Schöneberg, near Berlin, of which he is\r\n  curator, at 74,000 species.\r\n\r\n  Loudon’s useful work (_Hortus britannicus_) gives a general view of\r\n  the species which now are or recently have been, cultivated in English\r\n  gardens. The edition of 1832 enumerates, including indigenous plants,\r\n  exactly 26,660 Phanerogamia. We must not confound with this large\r\n  number of plants that either have been, or still are, cultivated in\r\n  Great Britain, “all the living plants which may simultaneously be\r\n  found in an individual botanic garden.” In this last respect the\r\n  Botanic Garden of Berlin has long been regarded as one of the richest\r\n  in Europe. The fame of its extraordinary riches rested formerly on a\r\n  mere approximative estimate of its contents, and, as my old friend and\r\n  fellow-labourer Professor Kunth, has very correctly remarked,[NO] “it\r\n  was only by the completion of a systematic catalogue, based on the\r\n  most careful examination of the species, that an actual enumeration\r\n  could be undertaken. This enumeration gave somewhat more than 14,060\r\n  species; and when we deduct from these 375 cultivated ferns, there\r\n  remain 13,685 Phanerogamia, among which there are 1600 Composite, 1150\r\n  Leguminosæ, 428 Labiatæ, 370 Umbelliferæ, 460 Orchideæ, 60 Palms, and\r\n  600 Grasses and Cyperaceæ. If we compare with these numbers the number\r\n  of species given in recent works, as, for instance, Compositæ\r\n  (according to Decandolle and Walpers), at about 10,000, Leguminosæ\r\n  8070, Labiatæ (Bentham) 2190, Umbelliferæ 1620, Grasses 3544, and\r\n  Cyperaceæ 2000,[NP] we shall perceive that the Botanic Garden at\r\n  Berlin cultivates only ⅐, ⅛, and ⅑ of the very large families\r\n  (Compositæ, Leguminosæ, and Grasses), and as many as ⅕ and ¼ of the\r\n  already described species belonging to the small families (Labiatæ and\r\n  Umbelliferæ). If we estimate the number of all the different species\r\n  of Phanerogamia _simultaneously_ cultivated in all the botanical\r\n  gardens of Europe at 20,000, we shall find, as they appear to\r\n  constitute about the eighth part of those already described and\r\n  contained in herbariums, that the whole number of Phanerogamia must\r\n  amount to nearly 160,000. This estimate need not be regarded as too\r\n  high, since scarcely the hundredth part of many of the larger\r\n  families, as, for instance, Guttifereæ, Malpighiaceæ, Melastomeæ,\r\n  Myrtaceæ, and Rubiaceæ, belong to our gardens.” If we take the number\r\n  (26,660 species), given in Loudon’s “Hortus Britannicus,” as the\r\n  basis, we shall find, from the well-grounded series of inferences\r\n  drawn by Professor Kunth, and which I borrow from his manuscript\r\n  notice above referred to, that the estimate of 160,000 will increase\r\n  to 213,000 species; and even this is still very moderate, since\r\n  Heynhold, in his “Nomenclator botanicus hortensis” (1846), estimates\r\n  the species of Phanerogamia already cultivated at 35,600. On the\r\n  whole, therefore,—and the conclusion is, at first sight, sufficiently\r\n  striking,—the number of species of Phanerogamia at present known by\r\n  cultivation in gardens, by descriptions, and in herbariums, is almost\r\n  greater than that of known insects. According to the average estimates\r\n  of several of the most distinguished entomologists, whose opinion I\r\n  have been able to obtain, the number of insects at present described,\r\n  or contained in collections without being described, may be stated as\r\n  between 150,000 and 170,000 species. The rich collection at Berlin\r\n  contains fully 90,000, among which there are about 32,000 beetles.\r\n  Travellers have collected an immense quantity of plants in remote\r\n  regions, without bringing with them the insects living upon them, or\r\n  in the neighbourhood. If, however, we limit these numerical estimates\r\n  to a definite portion of the earth’s surface that has been the best\r\n  explored in regard to its plants and insects, as, for instance,\r\n  Europe, we find the ratio between the vital forms of Phanerogamic\r\n  plants and those of insects changed to such a degree, that while\r\n  Europe counts scarcely 7000 or 8000 Phanerogamia, more than three\r\n  times that number of European insects are at present known. According\r\n  to the interesting contributions of my friend Dohrn in Stettin, more\r\n  than 8700 insects have already been collected from the rich fauna of\r\n  the neighbourhood, and yet there are still many MicroLepidoptera\r\n  wanting; while the number of Phanerogamia found there scarcely exceeds\r\n  1000. The Insect-fauna of Great Britain is estimated at 11,600. Such a\r\n  preponderance of animal forms will appear less surprising when we\r\n  remember that several of the large classes of insects live only on\r\n  animal substances, whilst others subsist on agamic plants (Fungi), and\r\n  even on those which are subterranean. Bombyx Pini, the Pine Spider,\r\n  the most destructive of all forest-insects, is infested, according to\r\n  Ratzeburg, by no less than thirty-five parasitical Ichneumonidæ.\r\n\r\n  These considerations have led us to the proportion borne by the number\r\n  of species growing in gardens to the gross number of those already\r\n  described and preserved in herbariums; it now remains for us to\r\n  consider the proportion of the latter to the conjectural number of\r\n  species existing on the whole earth, or, in other words, to test their\r\n  minimum by the relative numbers of the different families—_i. e._ by\r\n  variable _multipla_. A test of this kind gives, however, such low\r\n  results for the _lower_ amount, as plainly to show that even in the\r\n  large families, which appear to have been the most strikingly enriched\r\n  in recent times by the researches of descriptive botanists, our\r\n  knowledge is still limited to a very small portion of the treasure\r\n  actually existing. The _Repertorium_ of Walpers which completes\r\n  Decandolle’s _Prodromus_ of 1825 to 1846, gives 8068 species of the\r\n  family of the Leguminosæ. We may assume the mean ratio to be ¹⁄₂₁;\r\n  since it is ⅒ in the tropical zone, ¹⁄₁₈ in the middle temperate zone,\r\n  and ¹⁄₃₃ in the cold northern zone. The _described_ Leguminosæ would\r\n  therefore only lead us to assume that there were 169,400 species of\r\n  Phanerogamia existing on the earth, whereas the Compositæ, as already\r\n  shewn, testify to the existence of more than 160,000 known\r\n  Phanerogamia, _i. e._ such as have been described or are contained in\r\n  herbariums. This discrepancy is instructive, and will be further\r\n  elucidated by the following analogous considerations.\r\n\r\n  The larger number of the Compositæ, of which Linnæus knew only 785\r\n  species, and which have now increased to 12,000, appear to belong to\r\n  the Old Continent. At least Decandolle described only 3590 American,\r\n  while he estimated the European, Asiatic, and African species at 5093.\r\n  This abundance of Compositæ in our vegetable systems is however\r\n  deceptive, and only apparently considerable; for the quotient of this\r\n  family (which within the tropical zone is ¹⁄₁₅, in the temperate zone\r\n  ⅐, and in the frigid zone ¹⁄₁₃) shows that more species of Compositæ\r\n  than of Leguminosæ have hitherto eluded the diligent research of\r\n  travellers; for even when multiplied by 12 we only obtain the\r\n  improbably small number of 144,000 for the sum total of the\r\n  Phanerogamia! The families of the Grasses and of the Cyperaceæ give\r\n  still lower results, because a proportionally smaller number of\r\n  species have been described and collected. We need only cast a glance\r\n  at the map of South America, and remember that the vast extent of\r\n  country occupied by the grassy plains of Venezuela the Apure and the\r\n  Meta, as well as to the south of the woody region of the Amazon, in\r\n  Chaco, in Eastern Tucuman, and in the Pampas of Buenos Ayres and\r\n  Patagonia, has either been very imperfectly or not at all explored in\r\n  relation to botany. Northern and Central Asia present an almost\r\n  equally extensive territory occupied by steppes; but here a larger\r\n  proportion of dicotyledonous plants is intermixed with the Gramineæ.\r\n  If we had sufficient grounds for believing that one-half of all the\r\n  phanerogamic plants existing on the surface of the earth are known,\r\n  and if we estimate this number at only 160,000 or at 213,000 known\r\n  species; we must give to the family of grasses, whose general ratio\r\n  appears to be ¹⁄₁₂, in the former case at least 26,000, and in the\r\n  latter 35,000 different species, of which in the first case ⅛, and in\r\n  the second ⅒ are known.\r\n\r\n  The following considerations oppose the hypothesis that we are already\r\n  acquainted with half the Phanerogamia on the earth’s surface. Several\r\n  thousand species of Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons, and among them\r\n  lofty arborescent forms, have recently been discovered (I would remind\r\n  the reader of my own expedition) in districts of a very large extent,\r\n  which had already been explored by distinguished botanists. Yet that\r\n  portion of the great continents which has never been visited by\r\n  botanical observers far exceeds the extent of the parts even\r\n  superficially traversed. The greatest variety of phanerogamic\r\n  vegetation, _i. e._ the greatest number of species on an equal area,\r\n  is to be met with in the tropical or subtropical zones. It is\r\n  therefore the more important to bear in mind that we are almost wholly\r\n  unacquainted, north of the equator, in the New Continent, with the\r\n  floras of Oaxaca, Yucatan, Guatimala, Nicaragua, the Isthmus of\r\n  Panama, the Choco, Antioquia, and the Province de los Pastos; while\r\n  south of the equator, we are equally ignorant of the floras of the\r\n  boundless forest-region between the Ucayale, the Rio de la Madura, and\r\n  the Toncantin (three mighty tributaries of the Amazon), as well as of\r\n  those of Paraguay and the Province de las Missiones. In Africa, we\r\n  know nothing of the vegetation of the whole of the interior, between\r\n  15° north and 20° south lat.; and in Asia we are unacquainted with the\r\n  floras of the south and south-east of Arabia, where the highlands rise\r\n  to an elevation of 6400 feet; as also with the floras between the\r\n  Thian-schan, the Kuen-Lün, and the Himalaya; those of Western China;\r\n  and those of the great portion of the countries beyond the Ganges.\r\n  Still more unknown to botanists are the interior portions of Borneo\r\n  and New Guinea, and of some districts of Australia. Further to the\r\n  south the number of the species decreases in a most remarkable manner,\r\n  as Joseph Hooker has ably shown, from his own observation, in his\r\n  _Antarctic Flora_. The three islands which constitute New Zealand\r\n  extend from 34½° to 47¼° of latitude, and as they have besides\r\n  snow-crowned mountains more than 8850 feet in height, they must\r\n  exhibit considerable differences of climate. The most northern island\r\n  has been explored with tolerable accuracy from the time of Banks and\r\n  Solander’s voyage (with Capt. Cook), to the visits of Lesson, the\r\n  brothers Cunningham, and Colenso; and yet in more than seventy years,\r\n  the number of Phanerogamia with which we have become acquainted is\r\n  below 700.[NQ] This paucity of vegetable species corresponds with the\r\n  paucity of animal forms. Dr. Joseph Hooker has observed that “Iceland,\r\n  proverbially barren as it is, and upon which no tree, save a few\r\n  stunted birches, is to be found, possesses five times as many\r\n  flowering plants as Lord Auckland’s group and Campbell’s Islands\r\n  together, although these are situated at from 8° to 10° nearer the\r\n  equator in the southern hemisphere. The antarctic flora is at once\r\n  characterised by uniformity and great luxuriance of vegetation, which\r\n  is attributable to the influence exerted by an uninterruptedly cool\r\n  and humid climate. In Southern Chili, Patagonia, and Tierra del Fuego\r\n  (from 45° to 56° lat.) this uniformity is strikingly manifested on the\r\n  mountains and their declivities no less than in the plains. How great\r\n  is the difference of species when we compare the flora of the south of\r\n  France, in the same latitude as the Chonos Islands off the coast of\r\n  Chili, with the Scottish flora of Argyleshire, in the parallel of Cape\r\n  Horn. In the southern hemisphere the same types of vegetation pass\r\n  through many degrees of latitude. In the regions near the north pole\r\n  ten flowering plants have been collected on Walden Island (80½° north\r\n  lat.), while there is scarcely a solitary grass to be met with in the\r\n  South Shetland Islands, although situated 63° south latitude.”[NR]\r\n  These considerations on the distribution of plants prove that the\r\n  great mass of the still unobserved, uncollected, and undescribed\r\n  phanerogamia belong to the tropical zone, and to the contiguous\r\n  regions extending from twelve to fifteen degrees from it.\r\n\r\n  I have deemed it not unimportant to draw attention to the imperfect\r\n  state of our knowledge in this slightly cultivated department of\r\n  numerical botany, and to treat such questions in a more definite\r\n  manner than has hitherto been possible. In all conjectures regarding\r\n  relative numbers, we must first examine the practicability of\r\n  obtaining the _lowest limit_; as in the question, of which I have\r\n  treated elsewhere, regarding the ratio of the gold and silver coined\r\n  to the quantity of the precious metals existing in a wrought state; or\r\n  as in the question of how many stars, from the tenth to the twelfth\r\n  magnitude, are scattered over the heavens, and how many of the\r\n  smallest telescopic stars may be contained in the Milky Way?[NS] It is\r\n  an established fact, that if it were possible to ascertain completely\r\n  by observation the number of species of the large phanerogamic\r\n  families, we should at the same time obtain an approximate knowledge\r\n  of the sum-total of all the phanerogamia on the surface of the earth\r\n  (that is, the numbers included in every family). The more therefore we\r\n  are enabled, by the progressive exploration of unknown districts,\r\n  gradually to determine the number of species belonging to any one\r\n  great family, the higher will be the gradual rise of the lowest limit,\r\n  and the nearer we shall arrive at the solution of a great numerical\r\n  vital problem, since the forms, in accordance with still unexplained\r\n  laws of universal organism, reciprocally limit each other. But is the\r\n  number of the organisms a constant number? Do not new vegetable forms\r\n  spring from the ground after long intervals of time, whilst others\r\n  become more and more rare, and finally disappear? Geology confirms the\r\n  latter part of this question by means of the historical memorials of\r\n  ancient terrestrial life. “In the primitive world,” to use the\r\n  expression of the intellectual Link,[NT] “elements remote from each\r\n  other blend together in wondrous forms, indicating, as it were, a\r\n  higher degree of development and articulation in a future period of\r\n  the world.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  p. 222—“_Whether the height of the aërial ocean and its pressure have\r\n  always been the same_.”\r\n\r\n  The pressure of the atmosphere has a decided influence on the form and\r\n  life of plants. This life, owing to the fulness and abundance of the\r\n  leafy organs provided with interstitial openings, is principally\r\n  directed _outwards_. Plants mainly live in and through their surfaces,\r\n  and hence their dependence on the surrounding medium. Animals are more\r\n  dependant on _internal_ stimuli; they generate and maintain their own\r\n  temperature, deriving from muscular movements their electric currents,\r\n  and the chemical vital processes which arise from and re-act upon\r\n  those currents. A kind of cutaneous respiration constitutes an active\r\n  vital function of plants, and depends, so far as it is an evaporation,\r\n  inhalation, and exhalation of fluids, on atmospheric pressure. Hence\r\n  Alpine plants are more aromatic and hirsute than others, and more\r\n  amply provided with numerous exhalants.[NU] Zoonomic experiments teach\r\n  us, as I have shown in another work, that organs are more abundant and\r\n  more perfectly developed in proportion to the facility with which\r\n  their functional requirements are fulfilled. The disturbance\r\n  occasioned in the respiration of their external integuments, by\r\n  increased barometric pressure, renders it, as I have elsewhere shewn,\r\n  very difficult for Alpine plants to thrive in the plain.\r\n\r\n  Whether the aërial ocean surrounding the earth has always exerted the\r\n  same mean pressure is a question wholly undecided. We do not even know\r\n  for certain whether the mean barometric height has remained the same\r\n  during a hundred years at any one given spot. According to the\r\n  observations of Poleni and Toaldo, this pressure appeared variable.\r\n  Doubts were long entertained regarding the accuracy of these views,\r\n  but the more recent investigations of the astronomer Carlini render it\r\n  almost probable that in Milan the mean barometric pressure is on the\r\n  decrease. Perhaps the phenomenon is very local, and dependent on\r\n  periodic variations in descending currents of air.\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  p. 223—“_Palms_.”\r\n\r\n  It is remarkable, that of this majestic form of plants—the Palms—some\r\n  of which rise to more than twice the height of the Royal Palace at\r\n  Berlin, and which the Indian, Amarasinha, has very characteristically\r\n  called “kings among grasses,”—only fifteen species had been described\r\n  up to the time of the death of Linnæus. The Peruvian travellers, Ruiz\r\n  and Pavon, added only eight; whilst Bonpland and myself, traversing a\r\n  greater extent of country, from 12° south lat. to 21° north lat.,\r\n  described twenty new species, and distinguished as many more which we\r\n  named, without however being able to procure their blossoms in a\r\n  perfect state.[NV] At present (forty-four years after my return from\r\n  Mexico) more than 440 species of palms, from both continents, have\r\n  already been scientifically described, including the East Indian\r\n  species arranged by Griffith. The “Enumeratio Plantarum” of my friend\r\n  Kunth, which appeared in 1841, contains no fewer than 356 species.\r\n\r\n  The very few palms belonging, like our Coniferæ, Quercineæ, and\r\n  Betulineæ, to social plants, are the Mauritian Palm (_Mauritia\r\n  flexuosa_), and the two species of Chamærops, of which the Chamærops\r\n  humilis covers whole tracts of land at the estuary of the Ebro and in\r\n  Valencia, while the other, Chamærops Mocini, which we discovered on\r\n  the Mexican shore of the Pacific, is entirely without prickles. In the\r\n  same manner as there are some species of palms, including Cocos and\r\n  Chamærops, which are peculiar to sea-coasts, so also is there a\r\n  certain group of Alpine palms belonging to the region of the tropics,\r\n  which, if I mistake not, was wholly unknown before my South American\r\n  journey. Almost all these species of the palm family grow in plains\r\n  and in a mean temperature of 81°.5 and 86° Fahr., seldom advancing\r\n  higher up the sides of the Andes than to 1900 feet. The beautiful wax\r\n  palm (_Ceroxylon andicola_), the Palmetto of Azufral at the Pass of\r\n  Quindiu, (_Oreodoxa frigida_), and the reed-like Kunthia montana\r\n  (_Caña de la Vibora_) of Pasto, all flourish at elevations varying\r\n  from 6400 to 9600 feet above the level of the sea, where the\r\n  thermometer frequently sinks in the night to 42°.8 and 45°.5 Fahr.,\r\n  and the mean temperature is scarcely 57° Fahr. These Alpine palms are\r\n  interspersed with nut-trees, yew-leaved species of Podocarpus, and\r\n  oaks, (_Quercus granatensis_). I have determined, by accurate\r\n  barometric measurements, the upper and lower limits of the wax palm.\r\n  We began to observe it first on the eastern declivity of the\r\n  Cordilleras of Quindiu, at an elevation of 7929 feet, from whence it\r\n  ascended to the Garita del Paramo, and Los Volcancitos, as high as\r\n  about 9700 feet. The distinguished botanist, Don José Caldas, who was\r\n  long our companion in the mountains of New Granada, and who fell a\r\n  victim to Spanish party hatred, found, many years after my departure\r\n  from the country, three species of palms in the Paramo de Guanacos, in\r\n  the immediate vicinity of the limit of perpetual snow, and therefore,\r\n  probably at an elevation of nearly 14,000 feet.[NW] Even beyond the\r\n  tropical region (in lat. 28°), Chamærops Martiana[NX] rises on the\r\n  advanced spurs of the Himalaya range to a height of 5000 feet.\r\n\r\n  When we consider the extreme geographical and, consequently, also the\r\n  climatic limits of palms at spots which are but little elevated above\r\n  the level of the sea, we find that some forms (the Date Palm,\r\n  _Chamærops humilis_, _Ch. palmetto_, and _Areca sapida_ of New\r\n  Zealand,) advance far within the temperate zone of both hemispheres,\r\n  to districts where the mean annual temperature scarcely reaches from\r\n  57° to 60° Fahr. If we form a progressive scale of cultivated plants\r\n  in accordance with the different degrees of heat they require, and\r\n  begin with the maximum, we have Cacao, Indigo, Bananas, Coffee,\r\n  Cotton, Date Palms, Orange and Lemon trees, Olives, Spanish Chesnuts,\r\n  and Vines. In Europe, Date Palms, together with Chamærops humilis,\r\n  grow in the parallels of 43½° and 44°, as, for instance, on the\r\n  Genoese Rivera del Ponente, near Bordighera, between Monaco and San\r\n  Stefano, where there is a palm grove, numbering more than 4000 trees;\r\n  also in Dalmatia, near Spalatro. It is remarkable that the Chamærops\r\n  humilis is of frequent occurrence in the neighbourhood of Nice and in\r\n  Sardinia, whilst it is not found in the Island of Corsica, lying\r\n  between the two. In the New Continent, the Chamærops palmetto, which\r\n  is sometimes more than 40 feet high, does not advance further north\r\n  than 34°; a circumstance that may be explained by the inflection of\r\n  the isothermal lines. In the southern hemisphere, Robert Brown[NY]\r\n  found that palms, of which there are only very few (six or seven)\r\n  species, advance as far as 34° in New Holland; while Sir Joseph Banks\r\n  saw an Areca, in New Zealand, as far as 38°. Africa, which, contrary\r\n  to the ancient and still extensively diffused opinion, is poor in\r\n  species of palms, exhibits only one palm (_Hyphæne coriacea_) which\r\n  advances south of the equator, only as far as Port Natal, in 30° lat.\r\n  The continent of South America presents almost the same limits. East\r\n  of the chain of the Andes, in the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, and in the\r\n  Cis-Plata province, palms extend, according to Auguste de\r\n  St.-Hilaire,[NZ] as far as 34° and 35°. The Coco de Chile, (our Jubæa\r\n  spectabilis?), the only species of palm indigenous in Chili, advances\r\n  on the western side of the chain of the Andes, according to Claude\r\n  Gay,[OA] to an equal latitude, viz., to the Rio Maule.\r\n\r\n  I will here subjoin the aphoristic observations which, in March, 1801,\r\n  I noted down while on board ship, at the moment we were leaving the\r\n  palm region surrounding the mouth of the Rio Sinu, west of Darien, and\r\n  were setting sail for Carthagena de Indias.\r\n\r\n  “In the space of two years, we have seen as many as 27 different\r\n  species of palms in South America. How many then must have been\r\n  observed by Commerson, Thunberg, Banks, Solander, the two Forsters,\r\n  Adanson, and Sonnerat, on their extensive travels! Yet, at the moment\r\n  I am writing, our vegetable systems recognise scarcely more than from\r\n  fourteen to eighteen methodically described species of palms. The\r\n  difficulties of reaching and procuring the blossoms of palms are, in\r\n  fact, greater than can well be conceived; and, in our own case, we\r\n  were made peculiarly sensible of this in consequence of our having\r\n  directed our attention especially to palms, grasses, cyperaceæ,\r\n  juncaceæ, cryptogamia, and numerous other subjects hitherto much\r\n  neglected. Most of the palms flower only once a year, and this period\r\n  near the equator is generally about the months of January and\r\n  February. How few travellers are likely to be in the region of palms\r\n  precisely during this season! The period of blossoming of particular\r\n  trees is often limited to a few days, and the traveller commonly\r\n  finds, on his arrival in the region of palms, that the blossoms have\r\n  passed away, and that the trees present only fructified ovaries and no\r\n  male flowers. In an area of 32,000 square miles, there are often not\r\n  more than three or four species of palms to be found. Who can\r\n  possibly, during the brief period of flowering, simultaneously visit\r\n  the various palm regions near the Missions on the Rio Caroni, in the\r\n  Morichales at the mouth of the Orinoco, in the valley of Caura and\r\n  Erevato, on the banks of the Atabapo and the Rio Negro, and on the\r\n  declivity of the Duida? There is, moreover, great difficulty when the\r\n  trees grow in thick woods or on swampy shores (as at the Temi and\r\n  Tuamini), in reaching the blossoms, which are often suspended from\r\n  stems formidably armed with huge thorns, and rising to a height of\r\n  between 60 and 70 feet. They who contemplate distant travels from\r\n  Europe for the purpose of investigating subjects of natural history,\r\n  picture to themselves visions of efficient shears and curved knives\r\n  attached to poles, ready for securing anything that comes in their\r\n  way; and of boys who, obedient to their mandates, are prepared, with a\r\n  cord attached to their feet, to climb the loftiest trees!\r\n  Unfortunately, scarcely any of these visions are ever realised; while\r\n  the flowers are almost unattainable, owing to the great height at\r\n  which they grow. In the missionary settlements of the river net-work\r\n  of Guiana, the stranger finds himself amongst Indians, who, rendered\r\n  rich and independent by their apathy, their poverty, and their\r\n  barbarism, cannot be induced either by money or presents to deviate\r\n  three steps from the regular path, supposing one to exist. This\r\n  stubborn indifference of the natives provokes the European so much the\r\n  more, from his being continually a witness of the inconceivable\r\n  agility with which they will climb any height when prompted by their\r\n  own inclination, as, for instance, in the pursuit of a parrot, an\r\n  iguana, or a monkey, which, wounded by their arrows, saves itself from\r\n  falling by its prehensile tail. In the month of January the stems of\r\n  the _Palma Real_, our _Oreodoxa Regia_, were covered with snow-white\r\n  blossoms, in all the most frequented thoroughfares of the Havannah,\r\n  and in the immediate vicinity of the city; but, although we offered,\r\n  for several days running, a couple of piastres for a single spadix of\r\n  the hermaphrodite blossoms to every negro boy we met in the streets of\r\n  Regia and Guanavacoa, it was in vain, for, in the tropics, no free man\r\n  will ever undertake any labour attended by fatigue unless he is\r\n  compelled to do so by imperative necessity! The botanists and painters\r\n  of the Royal Spanish Commission of Natural History under Count Don\r\n  Jaruco y Mopox (Estevez, Boldo, Guio, Echeveria), confessed to us\r\n  that, for several years, they had been unable to examine these\r\n  blossoms, owing to the absolute impossibility of obtaining them.\r\n\r\n  “After this statement of the difficulties attending their acquisition,\r\n  the fact of our being only able, in the course of two years,\r\n  systematically to describe twelve species of palms, although we had\r\n  discovered twenty species, may be understood; but I confess it would\r\n  hardly have been credible to me before I left Europe. How interesting\r\n  a work might be written on palms by a traveller, who could exclusively\r\n  devote himself to the delineation, in their natural size, of the\r\n  spathe, spadix, inflorescence and fruits!” (Thus I wrote many years\r\n  before the Brazilian travels of Martius and Spix, and the appearance\r\n  of the admirable work on Palms by the former.)\r\n\r\n  “There is much sameness in the form of the leaves, which are either\r\n  feathery (pinnata), or fan-like (palmo-digitata); the leaf-stalk\r\n  (petiolus) is either without thorns or is sharply serrated\r\n  (_serrato-spinosus_). The leaf-form of _Caryota urens_ and _Martinezia\r\n  caryotifolia_, which we saw on the banks of the Orinoco and the\r\n  Atabapo, and subsequently in the Andes, at the pass of Quindiu, as\r\n  high as 3200 feet above the level of the sea, is almost as peculiar\r\n  among palms as is the leaf-form of the Gingko among trees. The habitus\r\n  and physiognomy of palms are expressive of a grandeur of character\r\n  which it is difficult to describe in words. The stem (_caudex_) is\r\n  simple, and very rarely divided into branches after the manner of the\r\n  Dracæna, as in Cucifera thebaica (the Doom Palm), and in Hyphæne\r\n  coriacea. It is sometimes disproportionately thick, as in Corozo del\r\n  Sinu, our Alfonsia oleifera; of a reed-like feebleness, as in Piritu,\r\n  (_Kunthia montana_), and the Mexican Corypha nana; of a somewhat\r\n  fork-like and protuberant form towards the lower part, as in Cocos;\r\n  sometimes smooth and sometimes scaly, as in the Palma de Covijaó de\r\n  Sombrero, in the Llanos; or, lastly, prickly, as in Corozo de Cumana\r\n  and Macanilla de Caripe, having the thorns very regularly arranged in\r\n  concentric rings.\r\n\r\n  “Characteristic differences also manifest themselves in the roots,\r\n  which, in some cases, project about a foot or a foot and a half from\r\n  the ground, raising the stem on a scaffolding, as it were, or coiled\r\n  round it in a padded-like roll. I have seen viverras and even very\r\n  small monkeys pass under the scaffolding formed by the roots of the\r\n  Caryota. Occasionally the stem is swollen only in the middle, being\r\n  smaller above and below, as in the Palma Real of the island of Cuba.\r\n  The green of the leaves is either dark and shining, as in Mauritia\r\n  Cocos, or of a silvery white on the under side, as in the slender\r\n  fan-palm, _Corypha Miraguama_, which we saw in the harbour of Trinidad\r\n  de Cuba. Sometimes the middle of the fan-like leaf is adorned with\r\n  concentric yellow and blue stripes, in the manner of a peacock’s tail,\r\n  as in the prickly Mauritia, which Bonpland discovered on the Rio\r\n  Atabapo.\r\n\r\n  “The direction of the leaves is a no less important characteristic\r\n  than their form and colour. The leaflets (foliola) are either ranged\r\n  in a comb-like manner close to one another, with a stiff parenchyma\r\n  (as in _Cocos Phœnix_), to which they owe the beautiful reflections of\r\n  solar light that play over the surface of the leaves, which shine with\r\n  a brilliant verdure in _Cocos_, and with a fainter and ashy-coloured\r\n  hue in the date-palm; or sometimes the foliage assumes a reed-like\r\n  appearance, having a thinner and more flexible texture, and being\r\n  curled near the extremity (as in _Jagua_, _Palma Real del Sinu_,\r\n  _Palma Real de Cuba_, and _Piritu del Orinoco_). This direction of the\r\n  leaves, together with the lofty stem, gives to the palms their\r\n  character of high majesty. It is a characteristic of the\r\n  physiognomical beauty of the palm that its leaves are directed\r\n  aspiringly upwards throughout the whole period of its duration, (and\r\n  not only in the youth of the tree, as is the case with the Date-Palm,\r\n  which is the only one introduced into Europe.) The more acute the\r\n  angle made by the leaves with the upper part of the stem (that is, the\r\n  nearer they approach the perpendicular,) the grander and nobler is the\r\n  form of the tree. How different is the aspect of the pendent leaves of\r\n  the _Palma de Covija del Orinoco y de los Llanos de Calabozo_ (Corypha\r\n  tectorum), from the more horizontal leaves of the Date and Cocoa-nut\r\n  palms, and the lofty heavenward-pointing branches of the _Jagua_, the\r\n  _Cucurito_, and _Pirijao_.\r\n\r\n  “Nature seems to have accumulated all the beauties of form in the\r\n  Jagua palm, which, intermingled with the Cucurito or Vadgihai, whose\r\n  stem rises to a height of 80 or even more than 100 feet, crowns the\r\n  granite rocks at the cataracts of Atures and Maypures, and which we\r\n  also occasionally saw on the lonely banks of the Cassiquiare. Their\r\n  smooth and slender stems rise to a height of from 64 to 75 feet,\r\n  projecting like a colonnade above the dense mass of the surrounding\r\n  foliage. These aërial summits present a marked and beautiful contrast\r\n  with the thickly-leaved species of _Ceiba_, and with the forest of\r\n  _Laurineæ_, _Calophyllum_, and the different species of _Amyris_ which\r\n  surround them. Their leaves, which seldom exceed seven or eight in\r\n  number, incline vertically upwards to a height of 16 or 17 feet, and\r\n  are curled at the extremities in a kind of feathery tuft. The\r\n  parenchyma of the leaf is of a thin grass-like texture, causing the\r\n  leaflets to wave with graceful lightness on the gently oscillating\r\n  leaf-stalk. The floral buds burst forth, in all species of palms, from\r\n  the stem immediately beneath the leaves; and the mode in which this\r\n  takers place modifies their physiognomical character. Thus in some, as\r\n  in _Corozo del Sinu_, the sheath is perfectly erect, and the fruit\r\n  rises like a thyrsus, resembling the fruits of the Bromelia. In the\r\n  greater number, the sheaths, which in some species are smooth, and in\r\n  others very prickly and rough, incline downwards. In some, again, the\r\n  male blossoms are of a dazzling white, and it may then be seen shining\r\n  from a great distance; but in most species of palms they are yellow,\r\n  closely compressed, and of an almost faded appearance, even when they\r\n  first burst from the spathe.\r\n\r\n  “In palms with feathery leaves the leaf-stalks either burst from the\r\n  dry, rough, ligneous portion of the stem (as in _Cocos_, _Phœnix_,\r\n  _Palma Real del Sinu_), or there rises in the rough part of the stem a\r\n  grass-green, smooth, and thinner shaft, like one column above another,\r\n  from which the leaf-stalk springs, as in _Palma Real de la Havana_,\r\n  _Oreodoxa regia_, which excited the admiration of Columbus. In the\r\n  fan-palms (_foliis palmatis_), the leafy crown often rests on a layer\r\n  of dry leaves, which imparts to the tree a character of melancholy\r\n  solemnity and grandeur (as in _Moriche_, _Palma de sombrero de la\r\n  Havana_). In some umbrella-palms, the crown consists of a very few\r\n  scattered leaves, raised on slender stalks (as in _Miraguama_).\r\n\r\n  “The form and colour of the fruit also present more variety than is\r\n  generally supposed to be the case in Europe. _Mauritia flexuosa_ has\r\n  egg-shaped fruits, whose smooth, brown, and scaly surface gives them\r\n  the appearance of young pine cones. How great is the difference\r\n  between the large triangular cocoa-nut, the berry of the date, and the\r\n  small stone-fruit of the Corozo! But of all the fruits of the palm,\r\n  none can be compared for beauty with those of the Pirijao (_Pihiguao_)\r\n  of San Fernando de Atabapo and of San Balthasar. They are oval, and of\r\n  a golden colour (one-half being of a purplish red); are mealy, without\r\n  seed, two or three inches in thickness, and hang in clusters like\r\n  grapes from the summits of their majestic palm-trunks.” I have already\r\n  spoken in the earlier part of this work of these beautiful fruits, of\r\n  which there are seventy or eighty clustered together in one bunch, and\r\n  which can be prepared in a variety of ways like bananas and potatoes.\r\n\r\n  The spathe enclosing the blossom bursts suddenly open in some species\r\n  of palms, with an audible report. Richard Schomburgk has like myself\r\n  observed this phenomenon[OB] in the flowering of the Oreodoxa\r\n  oleracea. This first opening of the blossoms of the palm accompanied\r\n  with noise, reminds us of Pindar’s Dithyrambus on Spring, and of the\r\n  moment when in the Argive Nemæa, “the first opening shoot of the\r\n  date-palm announces the coming of balmy spring.”[OC]\r\n\r\n  Palms, bananas, and arborescent ferns constitute three forms of\r\n  especial beauty peculiar to every portion of the tropical zone;\r\n  wherever heat and moisture co-operate, vegetation is most exuberant\r\n  and vegetable forms present the greatest diversity. Hence South\r\n  America is the most beautiful portion of the palm world. In Asia the\r\n  palm form is rare, in consequence perhaps of a considerable part of\r\n  the Indian continent beneath the equator having been destroyed and\r\n  covered by the ocean in some earlier revolution of our planet. We know\r\n  scarcely anything of the African palms between the Bay of Benin and\r\n  the coast of Ajan; and we are, generally speaking, as already\r\n  observed, acquainted with only a very small number of African\r\n  palm-forms.\r\n\r\n  Palms, next to Coniferæ, and some species of Eucalyptus belonging to\r\n  the family of the Myrtaceæ, afford examples of the loftiest growth.\r\n  Stems of the Cabbage-palm (_Areca oleracea_) have been seen from 160\r\n  to 170 feet in height.[OD] The Wax-palm, our Ceroxylon andicola, which\r\n  we discovered in the Montaña de Quindiu on the side of the Andes,\r\n  between Ibague and Carthago, attains the enormous height of 180 to 190\r\n  feet. I was able to make an accurate measurement of the trunks of some\r\n  of these trees, which had been felled in the woods. Next to the\r\n  Wax-palm, the Oreodoxa Sancona, which we found in flower in the valley\r\n  of Cauca, and which affords a very hard and admirable wood for\r\n  building, appeared to me to be the highest of all American palms. The\r\n  fact, that notwithstanding the enormous mass of fruit yielded by some\r\n  single palms, the number of individuals of each species growing wild\r\n  is not very considerable, can only be explained by the frequent\r\n  abortive development of the fruit, and by the voracity of the enemies\r\n  by whom they are assailed from all classes of animals. In the basin of\r\n  the Orinoco, however, whole tribes find the means of subsistence for\r\n  many months together in the fruit of the palm. “In palmetis, Pihiguao\r\n  consitis, singuli trunci quotannis fere 400 fructus ferunt pomiformes,\r\n  tritumque est verbum inter Fratres S. Francisci, ad ripas Orinoci et\r\n  Guainiæ degentes, mire pinguescere Indorum corpora, quoties uberem\r\n  Palmæ fructum fundant.”[OE]\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  p. 224—“_From the earliest infancy of human civilization_.”\r\n\r\n  We find, as far as history and tradition extend, that the Banana has\r\n  constantly been cultivated in all continents within the tropical zone.\r\n  The fact of African slaves having, in the course of centuries, brought\r\n  some varieties of the Banana fruit to America is as certain as that of\r\n  the cultivation of this vegetable product by the natives of America\r\n  prior to its discovery by Columbus. The Guaikeri Indians in Cumana\r\n  assured us that on the coast of Paria, near the Golfo Triste, the\r\n  Banana will occasionally produce germinating seeds, if the fruit be\r\n  suffered to ripen on the stem. It is from this cause, that wild\r\n  Bananas are occasionally found in the recesses of the forests, in\r\n  consequence of the ripe seeds being scattered abroad by birds. At\r\n  Bordones also, near Cumana, perfectly formed and matured seeds have\r\n  been occasionally found in the fruit of the Banana.[OF]\r\n\r\n  I have already remarked, in another work,[OG] that Onesicritus and\r\n  other companions of the great Macedonian, make no mention of high\r\n  arborescent ferns, although they speak of the fan-leaved umbrella\r\n  palms and of the tender evergreen verdure of the banana-plantations.\r\n  Among the Sanscrit names given by Amarasinha for the Banana (the\r\n  _Musa_ of botanists) we find _bhanu-phala_ (sun-fruit),\r\n  _varana-buscha_, and _moko_. Phala signifies fruit generally. Lassen\r\n  explains Pliny’s words (xii. 6), “Arbori nomen palæ, pomo arienæ,” to\r\n  this effect, that “The Roman mistook the word _pala_, fruit, for the\r\n  name of the tree, whilst _varana_, changed in the mouth of a Greek to\r\n  _ouarana_, was transformed into _ariena_. The Arabic _mauza_, our\r\n  Musa, may have been formed from _moko_. The Bhanu fruit seems to\r\n  approach to Banana fruit.”[OH]\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  p. 224—“_Form of the Malvaceæ_.”\r\n\r\n  Larger forms of the Mallow appear, as soon as we have crossed the\r\n  Alps; _Lavatera arborea_, near Nice and in Dalmatia; and _L. olbia_,\r\n  in Liguria. The dimensions of the Baobab (monkey bread-tree) have\r\n  already been given. (See pp. 270–272.) With the form of the Malvaceæ\r\n  are associated the botanically allied families of the Byttneriaceæ,\r\n  (_Sterculia_, _Hermannia_, and the blossoms of the large-leaved\r\n  _Theobroma Cacao_, whose flowers break forth from the bark of the\r\n  trunk as well as from the roots); the Bombaceæ (_Adansonia_,\r\n  _Helicteres_, and _Cheirostemon_); and, lastly, the Tiliaceæ\r\n  (_Sparmannia Africana_). Our _Cavanillesia plantanifolia_ of Turbaco,\r\n  near Carthagena in South America, and the celebrated Ochroma-like\r\n  Hand-tree, the _Macpalxochiquahuitl_ of the Mexicans, (from Macpalli,\r\n  the flat of the hand,) _Arbol de las manitas_ of the Spaniards, our\r\n  _Cheirostemon platanoides_, are splendid representatives of the mallow\r\n  form. In the last named, the anthers are connected together in such a\r\n  manner as to resemble a hand or claw rising from the beautiful\r\n  purplish-red blossoms. There is in all the Mexican free states only\r\n  one individual remaining, one single primæval stem of this wonderful\r\n  genus. It is supposed not to be indigenous, but to have been planted\r\n  by a king of Toluca, about five hundred years ago. I found that the\r\n  spot where the Arbol de las Manitas stands is 8825 feet above the\r\n  level of the sea. Why is there only one tree of the kind? Whence did\r\n  the kings of Toluca obtain the young tree or the seed? It is equally\r\n  enigmatical, that Montezuma should not have possessed one of these\r\n  trees in his botanical gardens of Huaxtepec, Chapoltepec, and\r\n  Iztapalapan, which were used as late as by Philip the Second’s\r\n  physician, Hernandez, and of which gardens traces still remain; and it\r\n  appears no less striking that the Hand-tree should not have found a\r\n  place among the drawings of subjects connected with natural history,\r\n  which Nezahual Coyotl, king of Tezcuco, caused to be made, half a\r\n  century before the arrival of the Spaniards. It is asserted that the\r\n  Hand-tree grows wild in the forests of Guatimala.[OI] We found two\r\n  Malvaceæ, _Sida Phyllanthos_ (Cavan.), and _Sida Pichinchensis_,\r\n  rising in the equatorial region to the great height of 13,430, and\r\n  15,066 feet on the mountain of Antisana and at the volcano of Rucu\r\n  Pichincha.[OJ] The _Saxifraga Boussingaultii_ rises from 600 to\r\n  upwards of 700 feet higher, on the declivity of Chimborazo.\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  p. 225—“_Form of the Mimosæ_.”\r\n\r\n  The delicate and feathery foliage of the Mimosæ, Acaciæ, Schrankiæ,\r\n  and Desmanthus, may be regarded as peculiarly characteristic of\r\n  tropical vegetation; although some representatives of this form may\r\n  also be found without the tropics. In the Old Continent of the\r\n  northern hemisphere, and indeed in Asia, I can instance only one low\r\n  shrub, described by Marshal von Bieberstein as _Acacia Stephaniana_,\r\n  but which, according to Kunth’s more recent investigations, is a\r\n  species of the genus _Prosopis_. This social plant covers the arid\r\n  plains of the province of Schirvan on the Kur (Cyrus), near New\r\n  Schamach, as far as the ancient Araxes. Olivier found it also in the\r\n  neighbourhood of Bagdad. It is the _Acacia foliis bipinnatis_\r\n  mentioned by Buxbaum, and which extends towards the north as far as\r\n  42° lat.[OK] In Africa the _Acacia gummifera_ (Willd.), extends to\r\n  Mogador, and therefore as far as 32° north lat.\r\n\r\n  In the New Continent, _Acacia glandulosa_ (Michaux), and _A.\r\n  brachyloba_ (Willd.), adorn the banks of the Mississippi and\r\n  Tennessee, and the Savannahs of the Illinois. The _Schrankia uncinata_\r\n  was found by Michaux to penetrate from Florida northwards to Virginia\r\n  (therefore as far as 37° north lat.). _Gleditschia triacanthos_ is met\r\n  with, according to Barton, to the east of the Alleghany mountains, as\r\n  far as 38° north lat., and west of the same range even to 41° north\r\n  lat. The extreme northern limit of _Gleditschia monosperma_ is two\r\n  degrees further southward. Such are the boundaries of the Mimosa form\r\n  in the northern hemisphere, while in the southern hemisphere, beyond\r\n  the tropic of Capricorn, simple-leaved Acaciæ are found as far as Van\r\n  Dieman’s Land; the Acacia cavenia described by Claude Gay being even\r\n  found in Chili between 30° and 37° south lat.[OL] Chili has no true\r\n  Mimosa, but three species of Acacia; and even in the north of Chili\r\n  the Acacia cavenia grows only to a height of 12 or 13 feet, whilst in\r\n  the south, as it approaches the sea-coast, it scarcely rises a foot\r\n  above the ground. The most sensitive of the Mimosas which we saw in\r\n  the northern portion of South America, are (next to the Mimosa\r\n  pudica,) _M. dormiens_, _M. somnians_, and _M. somniculosa_. The\r\n  irritability of the African sensitive plant was already noticed by\r\n  Theophrastus (iv. 3), and by Pliny (xiii. 10); but I find the first\r\n  description of the South American sensitive plants (Dormideras) in\r\n  Herrera (Decad. ii. lib. iii. cap. 4). The plant first attracted the\r\n  attention of the Spaniards, in 1518, in the Savannahs on the isthmus\r\n  round Nombre de Dios (“parece como cosa sensible”), and it was\r\n  pretended that the leaves (“de echura de una pluma de pajaros,”) only\r\n  contracted together when they were touched with the finger, and not\r\n  when brought in contact with a piece of wood. In the small swamps\r\n  which surround the town of Mompox on the Magdalena River, we\r\n  discovered a very beautiful aquatic Mimosa (_Desmanthus lacustris_), a\r\n  representation of which is given in our “Plantes équinoxiales” (t. i.\r\n  p. 55, pl. 16). In the chain of the Andes of Caxamarca we found two\r\n  Alpine Mimosas (Mimosa montana and Acacia revoluta) growing at\r\n  elevations of from 9000 to nearly 9600 feet above the level of the\r\n  sea.\r\n\r\n  As yet no true Mimosa, (in the meaning of the word as established by\r\n  Willdenow,) nor even any Inga, has been found in the temperate zone.\r\n  Amongst all the Acacias the Oriental _Acacia Julibrissin_, which\r\n  Forskäl has confounded with _Mimosa arborea_, endures the greatest\r\n  degree of cold. In the Botanical Garden of Padua there is a high stem\r\n  of considerable thickness growing in the open air, although the mean\r\n  temperature of Padua is below 56° Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:\r\n\r\n  p. 225.—“_Heaths_.”\r\n\r\n  We do not, in these physiognomical considerations, by any means\r\n  comprehend, under the name of Heaths, the whole natural family of the\r\n  Ericaceæ, which, on account of the similarity and analogy in the\r\n  flowering parts of the plant, include Rhododendrum, Befaria,\r\n  Gaultheria, and Escallonia; we limit ourselves to the very accordant\r\n  and characteristic form of the species of Erica, including Calluna\r\n  (_Erica vulgaris_, L.).\r\n\r\n  “Whilst in Europe Erica carnea, E. tetralix, E. cinerea, and Calluna\r\n  vulgaris, cover large tracts of country, extending from the plains of\r\n  Germany, and from France and England, to the extremity of Norway;\r\n  Southern Africa presents the most varied assortment of species. One\r\n  single species, Erica umbellata, which is indigenous in the southern\r\n  hemisphere, at the Cape of Good Hope, is again found in Northern\r\n  Africa, Spain, and Portugal. Erica vagans and E. arborea also belong\r\n  to the opposite coasts of the Mediterranean. The former is met with in\r\n  Northern Africa, in the neighbourhood of Marseilles, in Sicily and\r\n  Dalmatia, and even in England; the second in Spain, Istria, Italy, and\r\n  the Canaries.”[OM] The common heath, _Calluna vulgaris_ (Salisbury),\r\n  which is a social plant, covers large tracts from the mouth of the\r\n  Scheldt to the western declivity of the Ural. Beyond the Ural both\r\n  Oaks and Heaths disappear. Both are wanting in the whole of Northern\r\n  Asia, and in all Siberia, as far as the Pacific. Gmelin[ON] and\r\n  Pallas[OO] have expressed their astonishment at this disappearance of\r\n  Calluna vulgaris; which, on the eastern declivity of the Ural chain is\r\n  even more decided and more sudden than one might be led to conclude,\r\n  from the words of the last-named great naturalist. Pallas merely says,\r\n  “ultra Uralense jugum sensim deficit, vix in Isetensibus campis\r\n  rarissime apparet, et ulteriori Sibiriæ plane deest.” Chamisso, Adolph\r\n  Erman, and Heinrich Kittlitz collected Andromedas but no Calluna in\r\n  Kamtschatka and on the north-west coast of America. The accurate\r\n  knowledge which we at present possess of the mean temperature of\r\n  different portions of Northern Asia, as well as of the distribution of\r\n  annual heat throughout the different seasons, in no way explains the\r\n  non-advance of the Heath to the east of the Ural. Dr. Joseph Hooker\r\n  has treated with much ingenuity, in a note to his “Flora Antarctica,”\r\n  of the two contrasting phenomena of the distribution of plants,\r\n  “uniformity of surface accompanied by a similarity of vegetation”, and\r\n  again, “instances of a sudden change in the vegetation, unaccompanied\r\n  with any diversity of geological and other feature.”[OP] Is there an\r\n  Erica in Central Asia? That which Saunders, in Turner’s “Travels to\r\n  Thibet,”[OQ] has described in the highlands of Nepaul, besides other\r\n  European plants (Vaccinium Myrtillus, and V. oxycoccus), as Erica\r\n  vulgaris, is, according to the opinion communicated to me by Robert\r\n  Brown, probably the Andromeda fastigiata of Wallich. The absence of\r\n  Calluna vulgaris and of all species of Erica, throughout the whole of\r\n  the continental part of America is an equally striking fact, since\r\n  Calluna is met with in the Azores and in Iceland. It has not hitherto\r\n  been found in Greenland, but it was discovered some years ago in\r\n  Newfoundland. The natural family of the Ericaceæ is also almost\r\n  entirely wanting in Australia, where its place is supplied by the\r\n  Epacrideæ. Linnæus described only 102 species of the genus Erica, but,\r\n  according to Klotzsch’s observations, this genus comprises 440 true\r\n  species, after the varieties have been carefully excluded.\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  p. 226—“_The Cactus form_.”\r\n\r\n  When the natural family of the Opuntiaceæ is separated from the\r\n  Grossulariaceæ (species _Ribes_), and is confined within the limits\r\n  indicated by Kunth,[OR] we may regard the whole as exclusively\r\n  American. I am not ignorant, that Roxburgh, in the _Flora indica_\r\n  (inedita), mentions two species of Cactus which he regards as peculiar\r\n  to the south-east of Asia, viz., Cactus indicus, and C. chinensis.\r\n  Both are widely diffused, originally wild or having become so, and\r\n  different from Cactus opuntia and C. Coccinellifer; but it is\r\n  remarkable that this Indian plant should have no ancient Sanscrit\r\n  name. The so-called Chinese Cactus has been introduced by cultivation\r\n  into the island of St. Helena. Modern investigations, prosecuted at a\r\n  period when a more general interest has been awakened in relation to\r\n  the original distribution of plants, will unquestionably remove the\r\n  doubts that have frequently been advanced against the existence of\r\n  Asiatic Opuntiaceæ. We see, in a similar manner, certain vital forms\r\n  appear separately in the animal world. How long did the Tapir continue\r\n  to be regarded as a characteristic form of the New Continent! And yet\r\n  the American Tapir is, as it were, repeated in that of Malacca\r\n  (_Tapirus indicus_, Cuv.).\r\n\r\n  Although the Cactus form belongs, properly speaking, to the tropical\r\n  regions, there are some species in the New Continent, that are\r\n  indigenous to the temperate zone on the Missouri and in Louisiana; as,\r\n  for instance, Cactus missuriensis and C. vivipara. Back, in his\r\n  northern expedition, saw with astonishment, the banks of the Rainy\r\n  Lake in lat. 48° 40′ (long. 92° 53′) entirely covered with C. Opuntia.\r\n  South of the equator the Cactus does not advance further than Rio\r\n  Itata (lat. 36°) and Rio Biobio (lat. 37¼°) In the part of the chain\r\n  of the Andes lying within the tropics, I have found species of Cactus\r\n  (_C. sepium_, _C. chlorocarpus_, _C. bonplandii_) on elevated plains\r\n  from 9000 to upwards of 10,600 feet above the level of the sea; but in\r\n  Chili, in the temperate zone, a far more strongly marked Alpine\r\n  character is exhibited by Opuntia Ovallei, whose upper and lower\r\n  limits have been accurately determined through barometric measurements\r\n  by the learned botanist, Claude Gay. The yellow-flowering Opuntia\r\n  Ovallei, which has a creeping stem, does not descend below 6746 feet,\r\n  advancing as high as the line of perpetual snow; and even above it,\r\n  wherever a few masses of rock remain uncovered. These little plants\r\n  have been gathered at spots lying at an elevation of 13,663 feet above\r\n  the level of the sea.[OS] Some species of Echinocactus are also true\r\n  alpine plants in Chili. A counterpart to the much admired fine-haired\r\n  Cactus senilis is presented by the thick-wooled Cereus lanatus, called\r\n  by the natives _Piscol_, which has a fine red fruit. We found it near\r\n  Guancabamba, in Peru, on our journey to the Amazon river. The\r\n  dimensions of the Cactaceæ (a group on which the Prince of Salm-Dyck\r\n  was the first to throw considerable light) present the most striking\r\n  contrasts. Echinocactus Wislizeni, which has a circumference of seven\r\n  feet and a half, with a height of four feet and a quarter, is only\r\n  third in size, being surpassed by E. ingens, (Zucc.) and E.\r\n  platyceras. (Lem.)[OT] The Echinocactus Stainesii attains a diameter\r\n  of from two feet to two and a-half; E. visnago, belonging to Mexico,\r\n  has a diameter of upwards of three feet, with a height of more than\r\n  four feet, and weighs as much as from 700 to 2000 lbs.; while the\r\n  Cactus nanus, which we collected near Sondorillo, in the province of\r\n  Jaen, is so small and so loosely rooted in the sand, that it gets\r\n  between the toes of dogs. The Melocactuses, which are full of juice\r\n  even in the driest season, as the Ravenala of Madagascar (wood-leaf in\r\n  the language of the country from _rave_, _raven_, a leaf, and _ala_,\r\n  the Javanese _halas_, a wood), are vegetable springs, which the wild\r\n  horses and mules open by stamping with their hoofs—a process in which\r\n  they frequently injure themselves.[OU] Cactus Opuntia has spread\r\n  during the last quarter of a century in a remarkable manner through\r\n  Northern Africa, Syria, Greece, and the whole of Southern Europe;\r\n  penetrating from the coasts of Africa far into the interior, where it\r\n  associates with the native plants.\r\n\r\n  After being accustomed to see Cactuses only in our hothouses, we were\r\n  astonished at the density of the woody fibres in old cactus stems. The\r\n  Indians are aware that cactus wood is indestructible, and admirably\r\n  adapted for oars and the thresholds of doors. There is hardly any\r\n  physiognomical character of exotic vegetation that produces a more\r\n  singular and ineffaceable impression on the mind of the traveller,\r\n  than an arid plain densely covered with columnar or candelabra-like\r\n  stems of cactuses, similar to those near Cumana, New Barcelona, Coro,\r\n  and in the province of Jaen de Bracamoros.\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n  p. 226—“_Orchideæ_.”\r\n\r\n  The almost animal-like form occasionally observed in blossoms of the\r\n  Orchideæ is most strongly marked in Anguloa grandiflora, celebrated in\r\n  South America as the Torito; in the Mosquito (our Restrepia\r\n  antennifera); in the Flor del Espiritu Santo (likewise an Anguloa,\r\n  according to _Floræ Peruvianæ Prodrom._ p. 118, tab. 26); in the\r\n  ant-like flower of Chiloglottis cornuta;[OV] in the Mexican Bletia\r\n  speciosa; and in the whole host of our remarkable European species of\r\n  Ophrys: _O. muscifera_, _O. apifera_, _O. aranifera_, _O. arachnites_,\r\n  _&c._ The taste for these splendidly flowering plants has so much\r\n  increased, that the number of species cultivated by Messrs. Loddige,\r\n  which, in 1813, was only 115, was upwards of 1650 in 1843, and in\r\n  1848, the number was estimated at no fewer than 2360. What a treasure\r\n  of sumptuously flowering and unknown Orchideæ may be inclosed in the\r\n  interior of Africa wherever there is an abundant supply of water!\r\n  Lindley, in his beautiful work, _On the Genera and Species of\r\n  Orchideous Plants_, 1840, counted exactly 1980 species; whilst\r\n  Klotzsch at the close of the year 1848 counted 3545.\r\n\r\n  Whilst the temperate and cold zone possess only terrestrial Orchideæ,\r\n  growing close to the ground, both forms, the terrestrial, as well as\r\n  the parasitical, growing on the trunks of trees, are indigenous in the\r\n  beautiful regions of the tropics. To the former class belong the\r\n  tropical genera Neottia, Cranichis, and most Habenarias. But we have\r\n  found both these forms as alpine plants on the declivity of the Andes\r\n  of New Granada and Quito, viz., the parasitical (_Epidendreæ_)\r\n  Masdevallia uniflora (at an elevation of 10,231 feet), Cyrtochilum\r\n  flexuosum (at 10,103 feet), and Dendrobium aggregatum (at 9485 feet);\r\n  and the terrestrial forms of Altensteinia paleacea, near Lloa\r\n  Chiquito, at the foot of the volcano of Pichincha. Claude Gay is of\r\n  opinion that the Orchideæ supposed to have been found growing on trees\r\n  in the Island of Juan Fernandez and even at Chiloe, were probably only\r\n  parasitical Pourretiæ, which advance as far south at least as 40°. In\r\n  New Zealand, the tropical form of Orchideæ, hanging from trees, is\r\n  still to be seen as far south as 45°. But the Orchideæ of Auckland and\r\n  Campbell Islands (Chiloglottis, Thelymitra, and Acianthus), grow on\r\n  level ground in moss. In the animal world there is at least one\r\n  tropical form that penetrates further south. The Island of Macquarie\r\n  (lat. 54° 39′) has an indigenous parrot, which lives therefore in a\r\n  region nearer to the south pole than Danzig is to the north pole.[OW]\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:\r\n\r\n  p. 226—“_Form of the Casuarinæ_.”\r\n\r\n  Acacias, in which the place of the leaves is supplied by phyllodia,\r\n  Myrtaceæ (Eucalyptus, Metrosideros, Melaleuca, Leptospermum), and\r\n  Casuarinæ, constitute the sole characteristics of the vegetable world\r\n  of Australia (New Holland) and Tasmania (Van Diemen’s Land). Casuarinæ\r\n  with their leafless, thin, thread-like, articulated branches, and\r\n  their joints furnished with membranous, toothed spathes, have been\r\n  compared by travellers,[OX] according to differences of species,\r\n  either with arborescent Equisetaceæ (Horsetails) or with our Scotch\r\n  firs. I have been much struck with the singular appearance of\r\n  leaflessness presented by the small thickets of Colletia and Ephedra\r\n  in South America, near the coast of Peru. Casuarina quadrivalvis\r\n  penetrates, according to Labillardière, as far south as 43° in\r\n  Tasmania. The mournful form of the Casuarina is not unknown in the\r\n  East Indies and even on the eastern coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  p. 227—“_Acicular-leaved trees_.”\r\n\r\n  The family of the Coniferæ (including the genera of Dammara, Ephedra,\r\n  and Gnetum of Java and New Guinea, which are essentially allied to it,\r\n  though distinctly separated by the form of the leaf and the whole\r\n  conformation), plays so important a part in consequence of the number\r\n  of individuals in each species, and by its geographical diffusion,\r\n  while it covers in the northern temperate zone, as a social plant,\r\n  such extensive districts, that we are almost compelled to wonder at\r\n  the inconsiderable number of the species. We are not acquainted with\r\n  so many Coniferæ by three-fourths as there are Palms already\r\n  described, nay, the Coniferæ are numerically less than the Aroideæ.\r\n  Zuccarini, in his “Contributions to the Morphology of the\r\n  Coniferæ,”[OY] enumerates 216 species, of which 165 belong to the\r\n  Northern and 51 to the Southern hemisphere. These proportional numbers\r\n  must now, in consequence of my researches, be differently expressed,\r\n  since, with the species of Pinus, Cupressus, Ephedra, and Podocarpus,\r\n  which Bonpland and I discovered in the tropical part of Peru, Quito,\r\n  New Granada, and Mexico, the number of the cone-bearing trees\r\n  flourishing between the tropics amounts to 42. The excellent and\r\n  latest work of Endlicher[OZ] contains 312 species of Coniferæ now\r\n  living, and 178 of a primeval mundane period which are now buried in\r\n  the coal formation, in variegated sandstone, in keuper, and in Jura\r\n  limestone. The vegetation of the eocene world presents especially to\r\n  us forms which, by their coëval relationship with several families of\r\n  the present world, remind us that with it many intervening members\r\n  have disappeared. The Coniferæ, so frequent in the primeval world,\r\n  accompany, in particular, the ligneous remains of Palms and Cycadeæ;\r\n  but in the most recent beds of lignite or brown coal we again find\r\n  Coniferæ, our Pines and Firs, associated with Cupuliferæ (or\r\n  Mastworts), Maples and Poplars.[PA]\r\n\r\n  If the surface of the earth did not rise to great altitudes within the\r\n  tropics, the strikingly characteristic form of acicular-leaved trees\r\n  would have remained wholly unknown to the inhabitants of that zone. I\r\n  took great pains, in common with Bonpland, to trace out, in the\r\n  Mexican Highlands, the _lower_ and _upper_ boundary line of the\r\n  Coniferæ and Oaks. The heights, at which both begin to grow (los\r\n  Pinales y Encinales, Pineta et Querceta), are hailed with joy by those\r\n  who come from the sea coast, because they announce a climate not yet\r\n  invaded, as far as experience has hitherto shown, by that mortal\r\n  disease called the black vomit (vomito prieto, a form of the yellow\r\n  fever). For the oaks, especially the Quercus Xalapensis (one of the\r\n  twenty-two Mexican species of oak which we first described), the lower\r\n  line of vegetation, on the way from Vera Cruz to the capital of\r\n  Mexico, somewhat below the Venta del Encero, is 3048 feet above the\r\n  sea. At the western slope of the plateau, between the South Sea and\r\n  Mexico, the inferior line for oaks is something lower; it begins near\r\n  a hut named Venta de la Moxonera, between Acapulco and Chilpanzingo,\r\n  at the absolute height of 2481 feet. I found a similar difference in\r\n  the lower boundary line of the pine-forest. This boundary, towards the\r\n  South Sea, in the Alto de los Caxones, north of Quaxinquilapa, is for\r\n  the Pinus Montezumæ (Lamb.), which we at first had considered to be\r\n  the Pinus occidentalis (Swartz), at the height of 4092 feet; but\r\n  towards Vera Cruz, at the Cuesta del Soldado, it rises to 5979 feet.\r\n  Both these kinds of tree, therefore, the oaks and firs as specified\r\n  above, descended lower towards the Pacific than towards the Caribbean\r\n  Gulf. During my ascent of the Cofre di Perote, I found the superior\r\n  boundary Line of the oaks to be 10,353 feet; that of the Pinus\r\n  Montezumæ 12,936 feet (about 2000 feet higher than the summit of Mount\r\n  Ætna) and here, in February, considerable masses of snow had already\r\n  fallen.\r\n\r\n  The greater the heights at which the Mexican cone-bearing trees begin\r\n  to show themselves, the more singular is it, in the island of Cuba\r\n  (where, at the border of the tropical zone the air, it is true, is\r\n  cooled down during northerly winds to 46°.6 Fahr.), to see another\r\n  kind of fir (_P. Occidentalis_, Swartz), in the plain itself, or on\r\n  the gentle hills of the Isle of Pines, growing among palms and\r\n  mahogany trees (_Swietenia_). Columbus even makes mention of a\r\n  fir-wood (_Pinal_) in the journal of his first voyage (Diario del 25\r\n  de Nov., 1492), at Caya de Moya, north-east of Cuba. At Haiti, too\r\n  (St. Domingo), the Pinus occidentalis near Cape Samana descends from\r\n  the mountains down to the very beach. The stems of these firs, wafted\r\n  by the gulf-stream to the two Azores, Graciosa and Fayal, were among\r\n  the principal signs that proclaimed to the great discoverer the\r\n  existence of unknown lands in the West.[PB] Is it positively\r\n  ascertained that the Pinus occidentalis is entirely absent from\r\n  Jamaica, notwithstanding its lofty mountains? We may be permitted to\r\n  inquire also, what kind of Pinus grows on the eastern coast of\r\n  Guatimala, since the P. tenuifolia (Benth.) is assuredly found only on\r\n  the mountains near Chinanta.\r\n\r\n  On taking a general view of the species of plants which form the upper\r\n  tree-boundary in the northern hemisphere from the frigid zone to the\r\n  equator; I find, for Lapland, according to Wahlenberg, in the\r\n  Sulitelma Mountains (lat. 68°), not acicular-leaved trees but birches\r\n  (Betula alba), far above the upper limit of the Pinus sylvestris; and\r\n  for the temperate zone I find in the Alps (lat. 45° 45′) Pinus picea\r\n  (Du Roi), advanced beyond the birches. In the Pyrenees (lat. 42° 30′),\r\n  we find Pinus uncinata (Ram.) and P. sylvestris, var. rubra; within\r\n  the tropics in Mexico (lat. 19°–20°), Pinus Montezumæ extends far\r\n  beyond Alnus toluccensis, Quercus spicata, and Q. crassipes; and in\r\n  the snow-crowned mountains of Quito, beneath the equator, Escallonia\r\n  myrtilloides, Aralia avicennifolia, and Drymis Winteri attain the\r\n  highest limits. This last species of tree, identical with the Drymis\r\n  granatensis (Mut.), and the Wintera aromatica of Murray, presents, as\r\n  Dr. Joseph Hooker has shown,[PC] the most singular instance of the\r\n  uninterrupted dissemination of the same species of tree from the\r\n  southernmost part of Tierra del Fuego and Hermit Island, where it was\r\n  discovered as early as 1577 by Drake’s expedition, up to the northern\r\n  Highlands of Mexico, over a meridian extent of 86° of latitude or 5160\r\n  miles. Where the acicular or needle-leaved trees, as in the Swiss Alps\r\n  and the Pyrenees, and not the birch as in the extreme north, form the\r\n  boundary of arborescent vegetation on the loftiest mountains, which\r\n  they picturesquely encircle, they are immediately followed in their\r\n  ascent towards the snow-crowned summits, in Europe and Western Asia by\r\n  the Alpine roses, Rhododendra, and at the Silla de Caracas, and the\r\n  Peruvian Paramo de Saraguru, by the purplish-red blossoms of the\r\n  graceful Befariæ. In Lapland the Rhododendron laponicum immediately\r\n  follows the Coniferous trees; in the Swiss Alps, the Rhododendron\r\n  ferrugineum and R. hirsutum, and in the Pyrenees the R. ferrugineum\r\n  alone; and in the Caucasus the R. caucasicum. But R. caucasicum has\r\n  also been found isolated by De Candolle in the Jura mountains (in the\r\n  Creux de Vent), 5968 feet lower down, at the inconsiderable height of\r\n  from 3303 to 3730 feet. If we would trace out the last zone of\r\n  vegetation near the snow line we must name, according to our personal\r\n  observation, in tropical Mexico, Cnicus nivalis and Chelone\r\n  gentianoides; in the cold mountainous tracts of New Granada, the\r\n  woolly Espeletia grandiflora, E. corymbosa, and E. argentea; in the\r\n  Andes chain of Quito, Culcitium rufescens, C. ledifolium, and C.\r\n  nivale;—yellow-blossomed Compositæ, which replace the somewhat more\r\n  northerly lanose herbs of New Granada, and the Epeletiæ, with which\r\n  they have so much physiognomical resemblance. This substitution or\r\n  repetition of similar and almost identical forms in regions that are\r\n  separated from each other by seas or wide intervening tracts, is a\r\n  wonderful law of nature. It prevails even in the rarest forms of the\r\n  floras. In Robert Brown’s family of the Rafflesiæ, separated from the\r\n  Cytineæ, the two Hydnoræ in Southern Africa (H. Africana and H.\r\n  Triceps), described by Thunberg and Drege, have, in South America,\r\n  their counterpart in the H. Americana of Hooker.\r\n\r\n  Far above the regions of Alpine herbs, of the grasses and the lichens,\r\n  nay, beyond the boundary of perpetual snow, there occasionally appears\r\n  a phanerogamic plant, growing sporadically, and as it were isolated,\r\n  to the astonishment of botanists; and this occurs both within the\r\n  tropics and in the temperate zone, on fragments of rock which remain\r\n  free from snow and are probably warmed by open fissures. I have\r\n  already mentioned the Saxifraga Boussingaulti, which is found at a\r\n  height of 15,773 feet on the Chimborazo; in the Swiss Alps the Silene\r\n  acaulis, a clovewort or caryophyllea, has been seen at a height of\r\n  11,382 feet. The former vegetates at 640, the latter at 2621 feet\r\n  above the respective local limits of snow, heights which were\r\n  determined when both the plants were discovered.\r\n\r\n  In our European Coniferous woods the Red Pine (or Norway Spruce), and\r\n  the White (or Silver) Pine show great and remarkable variations as\r\n  regards their geographical dispersion on the slopes of mountains.\r\n  Whilst in the Swiss Alps the Red Pine (_Pinus picea_, Du Roi, _foliis\r\n  compressotetragonis_; unfortunately named by Linnæus and by most\r\n  botanists of our time the _Pinus abies_!), forms the limit of tree\r\n  vegetation at the mean height of 5883 feet, and only here and there\r\n  does the lowly alder (_Alnus viridis_, Dec., _Betula viridis_, Vill.),\r\n  advance higher towards the snow-limit; the White Pine (_Pinus abies_,\r\n  Du Roi, _Pinus picea_, Linn., foliis planis, pectinato-distichis,\r\n  emarginatis), has its limit, according to Wahlenberg, about 1000 feet\r\n  lower. The Red Pine does not grow at all in Southern Europe, in Spain,\r\n  the Apennines, and Greece; and, as Ramond remarks, it is only seen on\r\n  the slope of the northern Pyrenees at great heights, and is entirely\r\n  wanting in the Caucasus. The Red Pine extends further to the north in\r\n  Scandinavia than the White, which latter tree appears in Greece (on\r\n  the Parnassus, the Taygetus, and the Œta), as a variety with long\r\n  acicular leaves, _foliis apice integris, breviter mucronatis_, the\r\n  Abies Apollinis of the acute observer Link.[PD]\r\n\r\n  On the Himalaya the acicular-leaved form of trees is distinguished by\r\n  the mighty thickness and height of the stem as well as by the length\r\n  of the leaf. The chief ornament of the mountain range is the Cedar\r\n  Deodwara (_Pinus deodara_, Roxb.), which word is, in Sanscrit,\r\n  dêwa-dâru, _i.e._ timber for the gods, its stem being nearly from 13\r\n  to 14 feet in diameter. It ascends in Nepaul to more than 11,700 feet\r\n  above the level of the sea. More than 2000 years ago the Deodwara\r\n  cedar near the River Behut, that is, the Hydaspes, furnished the\r\n  timber for the fleet of Nearchus. In the valley of Dudegaon, north of\r\n  the copper mines of Dhunpoor in Nepaul, Dr. Hoffmeister, so early lost\r\n  to science, found in a forest the Pinus longifolia (Royle), or the\r\n  Tschelu Fir, mixed with the lofty stems of a palm—Chamærops martiana\r\n  (Wallich).[PE] Such an interspersion of the _pineta_ and _palmeta_ had\r\n  already, in the new continent, excited the astonishment of the\r\n  companions of Columbus, as a friend and contemporary of the admiral’s,\r\n  Petrus Martyr Anghiera, relates.[PF] I myself saw, for the first time,\r\n  this blending of pines with palms on the road from Acapulco to\r\n  Chilpanzingo. The Himalaya, like the Mexican highlands, besides its\r\n  genera of pine and cedar, possesses also forms of the Cypress\r\n  (_Cupressus torulosa_, Don.); of the Yew (_Taxus Wallichiana_,\r\n  Zuccar.); of the Podocarpus (_Podocarpus nereifolia_, Brown); and the\r\n  Juniper (_Juniperus squamata_, Don., and _J. excelsa_, Bieberst.; the\r\n  latter species occurring also at Schipke in Thibet, in Asia Minor,\r\n  Syria, and the Grecian Islands; on the other hand, Thuja, Taxodium,\r\n  Larix, and Araucaria, are forms of the New Continent, which are\r\n  wanting in the Himalaya.\r\n\r\n  Besides the twenty species of pine with which we are acquainted in\r\n  Mexico, the United States of North America, in their present extension\r\n  to the Pacific, present forty-five described species, whilst all\r\n  Europe can only enumerate fifteen. The same difference between\r\n  abundance and paucity of forms is shown in the oaks, in favour of the\r\n  New Continent (a quarter of the world the most connected and most\r\n  elongated in a meridional direction). It has, however, been very\r\n  recently demonstrated by the extremely accurate researches of Siebold\r\n  and Zuccarini to be an erroneous assertion, that many European species\r\n  of pine, in consequence of their wide distribution throughout Northern\r\n  Asia, passed over to the Japanese islands, and there mingled with a\r\n  genuine Mexican species, the Weymouth pine (_Pinus strobus_, L.), as\r\n  Thunberg asserts. What Thunberg considered to be European species of\r\n  pine, are species entirely different. Thunberg’s Red Pine (_Pinus\r\n  abies_, Linn.) is _P. polita_, Sieb., and often planted near Buddhist\r\n  temples; his northern common fir (_Pinus sylvestris_) is P.\r\n  Massoniana, Lamb.; his P. cembra, the German and Siberian stone\r\n  pine-tree, is P. parviflora, Sieb.; his common larch (_P. larix_) is\r\n  the P. leptolepis, Sieb.; his Taxus baccata, the fruit of which the\r\n  Japanese courtiers eat as a precautionary measure when attending long\r\n  ceremonies,[PG] forms a special genus and is Cephalotaxus drupacea,\r\n  Sieb. The Japanese islands, despite the proximity of the Asiatic\r\n  Continent, have a very different character of vegetation. Thunberg’s\r\n  Japanese Weymouth pine, which would present an important phenomenon,\r\n  is moreover a naturalized tree, that differs entirely from the\r\n  indigenous pines of the New World. It is Pinus korajensis, Sieb.,\r\n  which has migrated from the peninsula of Corea and Kamtschatka to\r\n  Nipon.\r\n\r\n  Of the 114 species now known of the genus Pinus, there is not one in\r\n  the whole southern hemisphere, for the Pinus Merkusii, described by\r\n  Junghuhn and De Vriese, still belongs to that part of the island of\r\n  Sumatra which is north of the equator, that is, to the district of the\r\n  Battas. The P. insularis, Endl., belongs to the Philippines, although\r\n  at first it was introduced into Loudon’s _Arboretum_ as P.\r\n  timoriensis. From our present increasing knowledge of the geography of\r\n  plants, we know that there are excluded also from the southern\r\n  hemisphere, in addition to the genus Pinus, all the races of\r\n  Cupressus, Salisburia (_Ginkgo_), Cunninghamia (_Pinus lanceolata_,\r\n  Lamb.), Thuja, one species of which (_Th. gigantea_, Nutt.) at the\r\n  Columbia river rises as high as 180 feet, Juniperus, and Taxodium\r\n  (Mirbel’s _Schubertia_). I can introduce this last genus here with the\r\n  greater certainty, inasmuch as a Cape plant, Sprengel’s Schubertia\r\n  capensis, is no Taxodium, but forms a special genus, Widringtonia,\r\n  Endl., in quite another division of the Coniferæ.\r\n\r\n  This absence from the southern hemisphere of the true Abietineæ, of\r\n  the Juniperineæ, Cupressineæ, and all the Taxodineæ, as likewise of\r\n  the Torreya, of the Salisburia adiantifolia, and of the Cephalotaxus\r\n  among the Taxineæ, vividly reminds us of the enigmatical and still\r\n  obscure conditions which determined the original distribution of\r\n  vegetable forms. This distribution can by no means be satisfactorily\r\n  explained either by the similarity or diversity of the soil, by\r\n  thermal relations, or by meteorological conditions. I have long since\r\n  directed attention to the fact, that the southern hemisphere\r\n  possesses, for instance, many plants of the natural family of the\r\n  Rosaceæ, but not a single species of the genus Rosa itself. Claude Gay\r\n  informs us, that the Rosa Chilensis, described by Meyen, is a variety\r\n  that has become wild of the Rosa centifolia, Linn., which has been\r\n  naturalized in Europe for thousands of years. Such wild-growing\r\n  varieties occupy large tracts in Chili near Valdivia and Osorno.[PH]\r\n\r\n  In the whole tropical region of the northern hemisphere we only found\r\n  one single indigenous rose, our Rosa Montezumæ, and this was on the\r\n  Mexican highland, near Moran, at a height of 9336 feet. We may count\r\n  among the strange phenomena observed in the distribution of plants,\r\n  the total absence of the Agave from Chili, though it possesses Palms,\r\n  Pourretias, and many species of Cactus; and although A. americana\r\n  flourishes luxuriantly in Roussillon, at Nice, at Botzen, and in\r\n  Istria, where it was probably introduced from the New Continent since\r\n  the sixteenth century, and where it forms one connected line of\r\n  vegetation from the north of Mexico, across the isthmus of Panama, as\r\n  far as Southern Peru. With respect to the Calceolarias, I long\r\n  believed that, like the roses, they were only to be found exclusively\r\n  on the northern side of the equator. In fact, among the twenty-two\r\n  species that we brought with us, not one was gathered to the north of\r\n  Quito and the volcano of Pichincha; but my friend Professor Kunth\r\n  remarks that Calceolaria perfoliata, which Boussingault and Capt. Hall\r\n  found near Quito, advances also as far as New Granada, and that this\r\n  species, as well as C. integrifolia, was sent by Mutis from Santa Fé\r\n  de Bogotá to the great Linnæus.\r\n\r\n  The species of Pinus, which are so abundant in the wholly\r\n  inter-tropical Antilles, as well as in the tropical mountain regions\r\n  of Mexico, do not cross the isthmus of Panama, and are wholly wanting\r\n  in the equally mountainous parts of tropical South America, that lie\r\n  north of the equator; they are equally unknown on the elevated plains\r\n  of New Granada, Pasto, and Quito. I have advanced in the plains and on\r\n  the mountains from the Rio Sinu, near the isthmus of Panama, as far as\r\n  12° south lat.; and in this territorial extent, of nearly 1600 miles\r\n  in length, the only forms of needle-leaved trees that I saw, were the\r\n  taxoid Podocarpus (P. taxifolia), 64 feet high, in the Andes pass of\r\n  Quindiu and in the Paramo de Saraguru, in 4° 26′ north and 3° 40′\r\n  south latitude, and an Ephedra (E. americana) near Guallabamba, north\r\n  of Quito.\r\n\r\n  Among the group of the Coniferæ, the following are common to the\r\n  northern and southern hemispheres: Taxus, Gnetum, Ephedra, and\r\n  Podocarpus. Long before l’Heritier, the last genus had been very\r\n  properly distinguished from Pinus by Columbus on the 25th of November,\r\n  1492. He says, “Pinales en la Serrania de Haiti que no llevan piñas,\r\n  pero frutos que parecen azeytunos del Axarafe de Sevilla.”[PI] Species\r\n  of yew extend from the Cape of Good Hope to 61° north lat. in\r\n  Scandinavia, consequently through more than 95 degrees of latitude.\r\n  Podocarpus and Ephedra are almost as widely distributed; and even from\r\n  among the Cupuliferæ, the species of the oak genus, usually termed by\r\n  us a northern form, though they do not cross the equator in South\r\n  America, reappear in the southern hemisphere, at Java, in the Indian\r\n  archipelago. To this latter hemisphere ten genera of the cone-bearing\r\n  trees exclusively appertain, of which we will here cite only the most\r\n  important: Araucaria, Dammara (_Agathis_, Sal.), Frenela (comprising\r\n  about 18 Australian species), Dacrydium and Lybocedrus, whose habitat\r\n  is both in New Zealand and the Straits of Magellan. New Zealand\r\n  possesses one species of the genus Dammara (_D. australis_), but no\r\n  Araucaria. The contrary, by a singular contrast, is the case in New\r\n  Holland.\r\n\r\n  In the form of acicular-leaved trees, Nature presents us with the\r\n  greatest length of stem existing in arborescent productions. I use the\r\n  term arborescent, for, as we have already remarked, among the\r\n  Laminariæ (the oceanic algæ) Macrocystis pyrifera, between the coast\r\n  of California and 68° south lat., often attains a length of more than\r\n  400 feet. If we exclude the six Araucarias of Brazil, Chili, New\r\n  Holland, the Norfolk Islands and New Caledonia, then those Coniferæ\r\n  are the highest, whose habitat is the temperate zone of the North. As\r\n  we have found among the family of the palms the most gigantic of all,\r\n  the Ceroxylon andicola, about 192 feet high, in the temperate Alpine\r\n  climate of the Andes, so in like manner do the loftiest cone-bearing\r\n  trees belong, in the _northern_ hemisphere, to the temperate\r\n  north-western coast of America and to the Rocky Mountains (lat. from\r\n  40° to 52°), in the _southern_ hemisphere to New Zealand, Tasmania or\r\n  Van Dieman’s Land, to Southern Chili and Patagonia, (where the lat. is\r\n  again from 43° to 50°). The most gigantic forms among the genus Pinus\r\n  are Sequoia (Endl.), Araucaria, and Dacrydium. I only name those\r\n  species whose height not merely reaches but often exceeds 200 feet.\r\n  That the reader may have a standard of comparison, he is reminded that\r\n  in Europe the loftiest Red and White Pines, especially the latter,\r\n  reach a height of from 160 to 170 feet; for instance, in Silesia, the\r\n  pine in the Lampersdorf forest, near Frankenstein, long famous for its\r\n  altitude, is only 158 feet high, although 17 feet in girth.[PJ]\r\n\r\n  We give the following examples:—\r\n\r\n  Pinus Grandis (Dougl.), in New California, attains a height of 202–224\r\n  feet.\r\n\r\n  Pinus Frémontiana (Endl.), also there, and probably of the same\r\n  height.[PK]\r\n\r\n  Dacrydium Cupressinum (Solander), in New Zealand, above 213 feet.\r\n\r\n  Pinus Lambertiana (Dougl.), in North-western America, 223–234 feet.\r\n\r\n  Araucaria Excelsa (R. Brown), the Cupressus columnaris of Forster, in\r\n  Norfolk Island and the surrounding rocks, 182–223 feet. The six\r\n  Araucariæ hitherto known fall into two groups, according to Endlicher:\r\n\r\n  α. The American (Brazil and Chili), A. brasiliensis [Rich.], between\r\n  15° and 25° south lat., and A. imbricata [Pavon], between 35° and 50°\r\n  south lat.; the latter 234–260 feet;\r\n\r\n  β. The Australian (A. Bidwilli [Hook.] and A. Cunninghami [Ait.] on\r\n  the eastern side of New Holland, A. excelsa of Norfolk Island, and A.\r\n  Cookii [R. Brown] of New Caledonia). Corda, Presl, Göppert, and\r\n  Endlicher have already found five fossil Araucariæ in lias, in chalk,\r\n  and in lignite.[PL]\r\n\r\n  Pinus Douglasii (Sab.) in the valleys of the Rocky Mountains and at\r\n  the Columbia River (north lat. 43°–52°). That meritorious Scotch\r\n  botanist, whose name this tree bears, suffered a dreadful death in\r\n  1833, when he came from New California to collect plants on the\r\n  Sandwich Islands. He inadvertently fell into a pit, into which one of\r\n  the wild bulls of that country, always viciously disposed, had\r\n  previously fallen. This traveller has described from accurate\r\n  measurements a stem of P. Douglasii, which at three feet from the\r\n  ground was 57½ feet round, and 245 feet high.[PM]\r\n\r\n  Pinus Trigona (Rafinesque), on the western slope of the Rocky\r\n  Mountains.[PN] This “gigantic fir” was measured with great care; the\r\n  girth of the stem at 6¼ feet above the ground was often from 38 to 45\r\n  feet. One stem was 300 feet high, and without branches for the first\r\n  192 feet.\r\n\r\n  Pinus Strobus (in the eastern part of the United States of North\r\n  America, especially on this side of the Mississippi, but also again in\r\n  the Rocky Mountains, from the source of the Columbia to Mount Hood,\r\n  from 43° to 54° north lat.), in Europe called the Weymouth Pine, and\r\n  in North America the White Pine, commonly no more than 160 to 190 feet\r\n  high, but several have been seen in New Hampshire of 250 and 266\r\n  feet.[PO]\r\n\r\n  Sequoia Gigantea (Endl.; the Condylocarpus, Sal.), of New California,\r\n  like the Pinus trigona, about 300 feet high.\r\n\r\n  The nature of the soil and the conditions of heat and moisture, on\r\n  which the nourishment of plants simultaneously depends, promote, it\r\n  must be admitted, the development and the increase of the number of\r\n  the individuals in a species; but the gigantic height attained by the\r\n  stems of a few among the many nearly allied species of the same genus\r\n  is not dependent on soil and climate but on a specific organization,\r\n  on internal natural disposition, common alike to the vegetable and to\r\n  the animal world. With the Araucaria imbricata of Chili, the Pinus\r\n  Douglasii of the Columbia River, and the Sequoia gigantea of New\r\n  California (245–300 feet) contrasts most strongly—not the Willow\r\n  (_Salix arctica_) stunted by cold or mountain height, and only two\r\n  inches high,—but a little phanerogamic plant in the beautiful climate\r\n  of the southern tropical region, in the Brazilian province of Goyaz.\r\n  The moss-like Tristicha hypnoides, of the Monocotyledonous family of\r\n  the Podostemeæ, hardly attains the height of three lines. “While\r\n  crossing the Rio Clairo in the province of Goyaz,” says an excellent\r\n  observer, “I perceived on a stone a plant, the stalk of which was not\r\n  more than three lines high, and which I considered at first to be a\r\n  moss. It was, however, a phanerogamic plant, supplied with sexual\r\n  organs like our oaks, and those gigantic trees which raised their\r\n  majestic heads around.”[PP]\r\n\r\n  Besides the height of the stem, the length, breadth, and position also\r\n  of the leaves and fruit, the aspiring or horizontal, almost umbellate\r\n  ramification, the gradation of the colour from fresh or silver-greyish\r\n  green to dark brown, give a peculiar physiognomical character to the\r\n  Coniferæ. The acicular leaves of Pinus Lambertiana (Douglas) in\r\n  North-Western America are five, those of the P. excelsa (Wallich) on\r\n  the southern slope of the Himalaya near Katmandu, seven, and those of\r\n  P. longifolia (Roxb.) on the mountain range of Cashmere, more than\r\n  twelve inches long. Moreover, in one and the very same species, these\r\n  acicular leaves vary in the most remarkable manner, from the combined\r\n  influence of the nourishment derived from soil and air, and of the\r\n  height above the level of the sea. I found these variations in the\r\n  length of the leaves of our common wild pine (_Pinus sylvestris_) so\r\n  great, while travelling in a west and east direction over an extent of\r\n  80° of longitude (more than 3040 miles) from the Scheldt, through\r\n  Europe and Northern Asia, to Bogoslowsk, in the Northern Ural, and\r\n  Barnaul beyond the Obi, that occasionally, deceived by the shortness\r\n  and rigidity of the leaves, I have mistaken it for another species of\r\n  pine, allied to the mountain fir, _P. rotundata_, Link, (_Pinus\r\n  uncinata_, Ram.) These are, as Link correctly observes,[PQ]\r\n  transitions to Ledebour’s P. sibirica of the Altai.\r\n\r\n  The delicate and pleasing green though deciduous foliage of the\r\n  Ahuahuete (_Taxodium distichum_, Rich., _Cupressus disticha_, Linn.)\r\n  on the Mexican plateau especially delighted me. In this tropical\r\n  region the tree, swelling out to a portly bulk, and the Aztec name of\r\n  which signifies “water-drum” (from atl, water, and huehuetl, drum),\r\n  flourishes from 5750 to 7670 above the level of the sea, whilst it\r\n  descends towards the plain in the marshy district (Cypress swamps) of\r\n  Louisiana as far as 43° lat. In the southern States of North America\r\n  the Taxodium distichum (_Cyprès chauve_), as well as in the lofty\r\n  plains of Mexico, attains a height of 128 feet, with an enormous\r\n  girth, the diameter being from 30 to nearly 40 feet, when measured\r\n  near the ground.[PR] The roots, too, present a very remarkable\r\n  phenomenon, for they have woody excrescences, which are sometimes of a\r\n  conical and rounded, sometimes of a tabular shape, and project three\r\n  and even nearly five feet above the ground. Travellers have compared\r\n  these woody excrescences, in spots where they are numerous and\r\n  frequent, to the grave-tablets of a Jewish churchyard. Auguste de St.\r\n  Hilaire remarks, with much acuteness: “These excrescences of the bald\r\n  cypress, which resemble boundary-posts, may be regarded as exostoses,\r\n  and like these live in the air; adventitious buds would doubtless\r\n  escape from them, if the nature of the tissue of the coniferous plants\r\n  did not oppose itself to the development of those concealed germs that\r\n  give birth to these kinds of buds.”[PS] In addition to the above, a\r\n  remarkably enduring vitality is manifested in the roots of\r\n  cone-bearing trees by the phenomenon which, under the name of\r\n  “Effervescence,” (aftergrowth?) has attracted, in many ways, the\r\n  attention of botanical physiologists, and which phenomenon, it\r\n  appears, rarely displays itself in other dicotyledonous plants. The\r\n  stumps of the felled white Pine, left in the ground, form, during a\r\n  succession of several years, new layers of wood, and continue to\r\n  increase in thickness, without throwing out shoots, branches, or\r\n  leaves. The excellent observer Göppert believes, that this takes place\r\n  solely through nourishment derived from the roots, which the extremity\r\n  of the stem receives from a neighbouring living tree of the same\r\n  species. The roots of the living tree he conceives are organically\r\n  incorporated with those of the stump.[PT] Kunth, in his excellent new\r\n  _Lehrbuch der Botanik_, is opposed to this explanation of a\r\n  phenomenon, which was even known, though imperfectly, to\r\n  Theophrastus.[PU] According to him, this process is perfectly\r\n  analogous to that by which metallic plates, nails, carved letters,\r\n  nay, even stags’ horns become imbedded within the body of wood. “The\r\n  cambium, that is, the thin, walled cellular tissue, conducting\r\n  muco-granular sap, from which new formations alone proceed, continues\r\n  without any relation to the buds (being perfectly independent of them)\r\n  to deposit new layers of wood on the outermost layer.”[PV]\r\n\r\n  The relation above alluded to, between the absolute height of the\r\n  ground and the geographical as well as isothermal latitude, shows\r\n  itself often, no doubt, when one compares the arborescent vegetation\r\n  of the tropical part of the Andes chain with the vegetation of the\r\n  north-west coast of America, or the banks of the Canadian lakes. The\r\n  same remark was made by Darwin and Claude Gay in the southern\r\n  hemisphere, when they, in their descent from the plateau of Chili,\r\n  advanced towards Eastern Patagonia, and the Archipelago of Tierra del\r\n  Fuego; here woods of Drymis Winteri, together with Fagus antarctica\r\n  and Fagus Forsteri, cover every thing with long uniform rows in a\r\n  northern and southern direction down to the low lands. Trifling\r\n  deviations from the law of constant _station-ratios_ between _mountain\r\n  height_ and _geographical latitude_, depending or local causes, not\r\n  sufficiently investigated, occur even in Europe. I would call to mind\r\n  the limits of altitude for the birch and common fir in a part of the\r\n  Swiss Alps, on the Grimsel. The fir (_Pinus sylvestris_) flourishes\r\n  there up to 6330; and the birch (_Betula alba_) up to 6906 feet;\r\n  beyond them again there is a belt of stone pines (_Pinus cembra_),\r\n  whose upper boundary is 7343 feet. The birch, in consequence, lies\r\n  there between two belts of Coniferæ. According to the excellent\r\n  observations of Leopold von Buch, and the more recent ones of Martius,\r\n  who also visited Spitzbergen, the limits of the geographical\r\n  distribution in the high Scandinavian north (in Lapland) are as\r\n  follows: “The Fir extends to 70°; the White Birch (_Betula alba_) to\r\n  70° 40′; the Dwarf-Birch (_B. nana_) to 71° at least: Pinus cembra is\r\n  entirely wanting in Lapland.”[PW]\r\n\r\n  As the length and the position of the acicular leaves define the\r\n  physiognomic character of the coniferæ, this is still more designated\r\n  by the specific difference of the leaf-breadth, and the parenchymatous\r\n  development of the appendicular organs. Several species of Ephedra may\r\n  be said to be almost leafless; but in Taxus, Araucaria, Dammara,\r\n  (Agathis), and the Salisburia adiantifolia of Smith (_Gingko biloba_,\r\n  Linn.), the breadth of the leaf gradually increases. I have here\r\n  arranged the genera morphologically. Even the names of the species, as\r\n  first chosen by botanists, indicate such an arrangement. Dammara\r\n  orientalis of Borneo and Java, often 11 feet in diameter, was at first\r\n  named loranthifolia: Dammara australis (Lamb.), in New Zealand, rising\r\n  to 150 feet high, was originally named zamæfolia. Neither of these has\r\n  acicular leaves, but “folia alterna oblongo lanceolata, opposita, in\r\n  arbore adultiori sæpe alterna, enervia, striata.” The lower surface of\r\n  the leaf is densely covered with stomata. These transitions of the\r\n  appendicular system, from the greatest contraction to a broad leaf\r\n  surface, possess, like every advance from simple to compound, both a\r\n  morphological and a physiognomical interest.[PX] The short-stalked,\r\n  broad, split leaf of the Salisburia (Kämpfer’s Ginkgo), has also the\r\n  breathing pores (stomata) only on the inferior side. The original\r\n  habitat of the tree is not known. It became distributed from the\r\n  Chinese temples to the gardens of Japan, in consequence of the\r\n  intercourse that existed in olden times between the congregations of\r\n  Buddha.\r\n\r\n  I was a witness of the singularly painful impression, which the first\r\n  sight of a pine-forest at Chilpanzingo made on one of our companions\r\n  in travelling from a port in the South Sea through Mexico to Europe.\r\n  Born in Quito, under the equator, he had never seen needle-leaved\r\n  trees and folia acerosa. The trees appeared to him to be leafless, and\r\n  because we were journeying towards the cold north, he thought he\r\n  recognised already, in the extreme contraction of the organs, the\r\n  impoverishing influence of the Pole. The traveller, whose impressions\r\n  I am here describing, and whose name neither Bonpland nor myself can\r\n  mention without regret, was an excellent young man, the son of the\r\n  Marquis de Selvalegre, Don Carlos Montufar, whose noble and ardent\r\n  love of freedom courageously led him, a few years later, to a violent,\r\n  though not dishonourable, death, in the war of independence, waged by\r\n  the Spanish colonies.\r\n\r\nFootnote 94:\r\n\r\n  p. 227—“_Pothos plants, Aroideæ_.”\r\n\r\n  Caladium and Pothos are forms appertaining exclusively to the tropical\r\n  world, whilst the different species of Arum belong more to the\r\n  temperate zone. Arum italicum, A. dracunculus, and A. tenuifolium\r\n  advance as far as Istria and Friuli. No Pothos has hitherto been\r\n  discovered in Africa. The East Indies possess several species of this\r\n  genus (P. scandens and P. pinnata), which have a less beautiful\r\n  physiognomy and are of less luxuriant growth than the American Pothos\r\n  plants. We discovered a beautiful true arborescent Aroidea (Caladium\r\n  arboreum), having a stem from 16 to more than 21 feet in height, near\r\n  the convent of Caripe, east of Cumana. Beauvois found a singular\r\n  Caladium (Culcasia scandens) in the kingdom of Benin.[PY] In the\r\n  Pothos form the parenchyma occasionally expands to so great a degree\r\n  that the leaf-surface becomes perforated with holes, as in Calla\r\n  pertusa (Kunth), and Dracontium pertusum (Jacquin), which we collected\r\n  in the forests of Cumana. It was the Aroideas which first drew\r\n  attention to the remarkable phenomenon of the _fever-heat_ evolved by\r\n  certain plants during the period of their inflorescence, and which\r\n  even sensibly affects the thermometer, and is connected with a great\r\n  and temporary increase in the absorption of oxygen from the\r\n  atmosphere. Lamarck, in 1789, observed this increase of temperature in\r\n  the Arum italicum. According to Hubert and Bory de St. Vincent, the\r\n  vital heat of the Arum cordifolium rises in the Isle of France to 110°\r\n  or 120°, whilst the temperature of the surrounding air is only 66°.2\r\n  Fahr. Even in Europe, Becquerel and Breschet found a difference of\r\n  39°.4. Dutrochet observed a paroxysm,—a rhythmical decrease and\r\n  increase of vital heat,—which appeared by day to attain a double\r\n  maximum. Théodore de Saussure remarked analogous augmentations of\r\n  heat, although only of 1°.1 and 1°.8 Fahr., in other families of\r\n  plants; as, for instance, in Bignonia radicans and Cucurbita pepo. In\r\n  the latter, the male plant exhibited a greater increase of temperature\r\n  than the female, when measured by a very sensitive thermoscopic\r\n  apparatus. Dutrochet—whose early death is greatly to be regretted, on\r\n  account of the important services he rendered to physics and vegetable\r\n  physiology—likewise observed,[PZ] by means of thermo-magnetic\r\n  multiplicators, a vital heat of 0°.25 to 0°.67 Fahr. in many young\r\n  plants (Euphorbia lathyris, Lilium candidum, Papaver somniferum), and\r\n  even among funguses, in many species of Agaricus and Lycoperdon. This\r\n  vital heat disappeared at night, but not by day, even when the plants\r\n  were placed in the dark.\r\n\r\n  The contrast presented by the physiognomy of the Casuarineas,\r\n  acicular-leaved trees, and the almost leafless Peruvian Colletias and\r\n  Pothos plants (Aroideas), is still more striking when we compare these\r\n  types of extreme contraction in the leaf form with Nymphæaceæ and\r\n  Nelumboneæ. Here we again meet, as in the Aroideæ, with leaves in\r\n  which the cellular tissue is excessively expanded upon long, fleshy,\r\n  succulent petioles,—as Nymphæa alba, N. lutea, N. thermalis (formerly\r\n  called N. lotus, from the hot spring of Pecze, near Groswardein in\r\n  Hungary), the species of Nelumbo, Euryale amazonica (Pöppig), and\r\n  Victoria Regina, allied to the prickly Euryale, although of a very\r\n  different genus, according to Lindley, and discovered in 1837 by Sir\r\n  Robert Schomburgk in the river Berbice, in British Guiana. The round\r\n  leaves of this splendid aquatic plant are from 5 to 6 feet in\r\n  diameter, and surrounded by upright margins from 3 to 5 inches in\r\n  height, which are light green on the inner side, but of a bright\r\n  crimson on the outside. These agreeably perfumed flowers, of which 20\r\n  or 30 may be seen together in a small space, are about 15 inches in\r\n  diameter, of a white or rose colour, and have many hundred petals.[QA]\r\n  Pöppig also gives to the leaves of his Euryale amazonica, which he\r\n  found at Tefé, a diameter of about 6 feet.[QB] Whilst Euryale and\r\n  Victoria present a greater parenchymatous expansion of the leaf-form\r\n  in all its dimensions than other genera, the most gigantic development\r\n  of the blossoms occurs in a parasitical Cytinea, which Dr. Arnold\r\n  discovered in Sumatra in 1818. This flower, Rafflesia Arnoldi (R.\r\n  Brown), has a stemless blossom measuring three feet in diameter,\r\n  surrounded by large leaf-like scales. Like funguses, it has an animal\r\n  odour, and smells something like beef.\r\n\r\nFootnote 95:\r\n\r\n  p. 227—“_Lianes, Creeping Plants, (Span. Vejuccos.)_”\r\n\r\n  According to Kunth’s division of Bauhinias, the true genus Bauhinia\r\n  belongs to the New Continent. The African Bauhinia, B. rufescens\r\n  (Lam.), is a Pauletia (Cav.), a genus of which we also discovered some\r\n  new species in South America. In the same manner the Banisterias of\r\n  the Malpighiaceæ are actually an American form. Two species are\r\n  indigenous to the East Indies, and one—described by Cavanilles as B.\r\n  leona—to Western Africa. In the tropical zone, and in the Southern\r\n  hemisphere, species of the most different families belong to the\r\n  climbing plants which in those regions render the forests so\r\n  impenetrable to man and so accessible and habitable to the whole\r\n  monkey family (Quadrumana), the Cercoleptes, and the small tiger cats.\r\n  The Lianes thus afford whole flocks of gregarious animals an easy\r\n  means of rapidly ascending high trees, passing from one tree to\r\n  another, and even of crossing brooks and rivulets.\r\n\r\n  In the south of Europe and in the north of America, Hops from the\r\n  Urticeæ, and the species of Vitis from the Ampelideæ, belong to\r\n  Climbing Plants; while this form is represented in the tropics by\r\n  climbing and trailing grasses. We found on the elevated plains of\r\n  Bogota, in the pass of Quindiu in the Andes, and in the Cinchona\r\n  forests of Loxa, a Bambusa allied to Nastus, our Chusquea scandens,\r\n  twined round powerful trunks of trees, adorned at the same time with\r\n  flowering Orchideæ. Bambusa scandens (Tjankorreh), which Blume found\r\n  in Java, belongs probably to Nastus, or to the grass-genus Chusquea,\r\n  the Carrizo of the Spanish settlers. In the pine forests of Mexico,\r\n  Climbing Plants seem to be entirely wanting; but in New Zealand a\r\n  fragrant Pandanus, Freycinetia Banksii, together with one of the\r\n  Smilaceæ, Ripogonum parviflorum (R. Brown), which renders the forests\r\n  almost impenetrable, winds round a gigantic fir-tree more than 200\r\n  feet high, Podocarpus dacryoides (Rich.), called Kakikatea in the\r\n  language of the country.[QC]\r\n\r\n  A striking contrast to these Climbing Grasses and Creeping Pandaneas\r\n  is afforded by the splendid many-coloured blossoms of the Passion\r\n  flowers (among which, however, we ourselves found one arborescent,\r\n  upright, species (Passiflora glauca) in the Andes of Popayan, at an\r\n  elevation of nearly 10,500 feet, and by the Bignoniaceæ, Mutisiæ,\r\n  Alströmeriæ, Urvilleæ, and Aristolochiæ. Among the latter, our\r\n  Aristolochia cordata has a coloured (purplish red) calyx, about\r\n  seventeen inches in diameter; “flores gigantei, pueris mitræ instar\r\n  inservientes.” Owing to the quadrangular form of their stalks, their\r\n  flattening, which is not occasioned by any external pressure, and a\r\n  band-like undulatory motion, many of these climbing plants have a\r\n  peculiar physiognomy. The diagonal intersections of the stems of\r\n  Bignonias and Banisterias form, by means of furrows in the ligneous\r\n  substance, and through its clefts, where the bark penetrates to some\r\n  depth, cruciform or mosaic-like figures.[QD]\r\n\r\nFootnote 96:\r\n\r\n  p. 228—“_The form of Aloes_.”\r\n\r\n  To this group of plants, which is characterised by a great similarity,\r\n  belong Yucca aloifolia, which penetrates as far north as Florida and\r\n  South Carolina; Y. angustifolia (Nutt.), which advances to the banks\r\n  of the Missouri; Aletris arborea; the Dragon-tree of the Canaries, and\r\n  two other Dracænas belonging to New Zealand; arborescent Euphorbias;\r\n  and Aloe dichotoma, Linn., (formerly the genus Rhipidodendrum of\r\n  Willdenow), the celebrated Koker-boom, whose stem is four feet in\r\n  thickness, about twenty feet high, and has a crown measuring 426 feet\r\n  round.[QE] The forms which I have here associated together belong to\r\n  very different families: as, for instance, to the Liliaceæ,\r\n  Asphodeleæ, Pandaneæ, Amaryllideæ, and Euphorbiaceæ; and are\r\n  therefore, with the exception of the last named, all included under\r\n  the great division of Monocotyledons. One of the Pandaneæ, Phytelephas\r\n  macrocarpa (Ruiz), which we found on the banks of the Magdalena river\r\n  in New Granada, exactly resembles with its feathery leaves a small\r\n  palm-tree. The Tagua (as it is called by the Indians) is moreover, as\r\n  Kunth has observed, the only Pandanea of the New Continent. The\r\n  singular Agave-like and high-stemmed Doryanthes excelsa of New South\r\n  Wales, which the intelligent Correa de Serra was the first to\r\n  describe, belongs to the Amaryllideæ, like our low-growing Narcissuses\r\n  and Jonquils.\r\n\r\n  In the candelabra-like form of Aloes, the branches of the main-trunk\r\n  must not be confounded with the flower-stalks. In the American aloe,\r\n  Agave Americana (Maguey de Cocuyza), which is entirely wanting in\r\n  Chili, and in the Yucca acaulis (Maguey de Cocuyza), the leaf-stalks\r\n  present a candelabra-like arrangement of the blossoms during the\r\n  excessively rapid and gigantic development of the inflorescence,\r\n  which, as is well known, is but too transient a phenomenon. In some\r\n  arborescent Euphorbias the physiognomical character depends, however,\r\n  on the branches and their arrangement. Lichtenstein describes,[QF]\r\n  with much animation, the impression made upon him by the appearance of\r\n  an Euphorbia officinarum which he saw in the “Chamtoos Rivier,” near\r\n  Cape Town. The form of the tree was so symmetrical, that it repeated\r\n  itself on a small scale, like a candelabrum, to a height of more than\r\n  30 feet. All the branches were furnished with sharp thorns.\r\n\r\n  Palms, Yucca and Aloe plants, arborescent Ferns, some Aralias, and the\r\n  Theophrasta, where I have seen it in a state of luxuriant growth,\r\n  present to the eye a certain physiognomical resemblance of character\r\n  by the nakedness of the stems (there being no branches) and the beauty\r\n  of their summits or crowns, however they may otherwise differ in the\r\n  structure of the inflorescence.\r\n\r\n  Melanoselinum decipiens, (Hofm.), which has been introduced into our\r\n  gardens from Madeira, and is sometimes from 10 to 12 feet high,\r\n  belongs to a peculiar group of arborescent umbelliferæ allied to the\r\n  Araliaceæ, to which other species, as yet undiscovered, will\r\n  undoubtedly at some future time be added. Ferula, Heracleum, and\r\n  Thapsia likewise attain a considerable height, but they are still\r\n  herbaceous shrubs. Melanoselinum stands almost entirely alone as an\r\n  arborescent umbelliferous plant; Bupleurum (_Tenoria_) fruticosum,\r\n  Linn., of the shores of the Mediterranean, Bubon galbanum of the Cape,\r\n  and Crithmum maritimum of our sea-coasts, are only shrubs. Tropical\r\n  countries, where, as Adanson long since very correctly remarked,\r\n  Umbellifereæ and Crucifereæ are almost wholly wanting in the plains,\r\n  exhibit, as we ourselves observed, the most dwarfish of all the\r\n  umbelliferous family on the lofty mountain ridges of the South\r\n  American and Mexican Andes. Among the thirty-eight species which we\r\n  collected on elevations whose mean temperature was below 54°.5 Fahr.,\r\n  we found Myrrhis andicola, Fragosa arctioïdes, and Pectophytum\r\n  pedunculare, interspersed with an equally dwarfish Alpine Draba,\r\n  growing moss-like close to the rock and the frequently frozen earth,\r\n  at a height of 13,428 feet above the level of the sea. The only\r\n  tropical umbelliferous plants which we found on the plain in the New\r\n  Continent were two species of Hydrocotyle (_H. umbellata_ and _H.\r\n  leptostachya_) between the Havannah and Batabano, and therefore at the\r\n  extreme limit of the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nFootnote 97:\r\n\r\n  p. 228—“_The form of Grasses_.”\r\n\r\n  The group of the arborescent grasses which Kunth has collected under\r\n  the head of Bambusaceæ, in his great work on the plants collected by\r\n  Bonpland and myself, constitutes one of the most beautiful adornments\r\n  of tropical vegetation. Bambu, called also Mambu, occurs in the Malay\r\n  language, although according to Buschmann merely as an isolated\r\n  expression, the ordinary term in use being buluh, whilst the only name\r\n  for this species of cane in Java and Madagascar is wuluh, voulou. The\r\n  numbers of the genera and species included in this group have been\r\n  extraordinarily increased by the industry of botanical travellers. It\r\n  has been found that the genus Bambusa is entirely wanting in the New\r\n  Continent, to which region, however, the gigantic Guaduas, discovered\r\n  by us, and which attain a height of from 50 to 64 feet, together with\r\n  the Chusquea, exclusively belong; that Arundinaria (Rich.) occurs in\r\n  both continents, although differing specifically in each; that Bambusa\r\n  and Beesha (Rheed.), occur in India and the Indian Archipelago; and\r\n  that Nastus grows in the islands of Madagascar and Bourbon. With the\r\n  exception of the high-climbing Chusquea, these forms morphologically\r\n  replace each other in different parts of the earth. In the northern\r\n  hemisphere far beyond the limits of the torrid region, in the valley\r\n  of the Mississippi, the traveller is gladdened by the sight of a\r\n  species of Bamboo, the Arundinaria macrosperma, formerly called also\r\n  Miegia and Ludolfia. In the southern hemisphere, in the south of\r\n  Chili, between the parallels of 37° and 42°, Gay found one of the\r\n  Bambusaceæ more than 20 feet high (not a climbing, but a still\r\n  undescribed arborescent self-supporting Chusquea), growing, mingled\r\n  with Drymis Chilensis, in a region clothed with an uniform\r\n  forest-covering of Fagus obliqua.\r\n\r\n  Whilst in India the Bambusa flowers so frequently that in Mysore and\r\n  Orissa the seeds are mixed with honey, and eaten like rice,[QG] in\r\n  South America the Guadua blossoms so very seldom that in the course of\r\n  four years we were only twice able to procure the flowers; once on the\r\n  solitary banks of the Cassiquiare, the arm connecting the Orinoco with\r\n  the Rio Negro and the Amazon, and again in the province of Popayan,\r\n  between Buga and Quilichao. It is a very striking fact that some\r\n  plants grow with the greatest vigour in certain localities without\r\n  flowering; as is the case with the European olive-trees introduced\r\n  into America centuries ago, and growing between the tropics, near\r\n  Quito, at elevations of about 9600 feet above the level of the sea;\r\n  and in like manner the walnuts, hazel-nut bushes, and the fine\r\n  olive-trees (_Olea Europea_) of the Isle of France.[QH]\r\n\r\n  As some of the Bambusaceæ (arborescent grasses) advance into the\r\n  temperate zone, so also they do not suffer in the torrid zone from the\r\n  temperate climate of mountain districts. They are certainly more\r\n  luxuriant as social plants between the sea-shore and elevations of\r\n  about 2558 feet in the Province de las Esmeraldas, west of the volcano\r\n  of Pichincha, where Guadua angustifolia (Bambusa Guadua of our\r\n  _Plantes équinoxiales_, t, i. tab. xx) generates in its interior large\r\n  quantities of the siliceous Tabaschir (Sanscrit _tvakkschira_,\r\n  cow-milk). We saw the Guadua advance in the pass of Quindiu, in the\r\n  chain of the Andes, to a height of 5755 feet above the level of the\r\n  sea, as determined by barometric measurements. Nastus borbonicus has\r\n  been called a true Alpine plant by Bory de St. Vincent, and according\r\n  to him it does not descend lower than 3840 feet on the declivity of\r\n  the volcano in the island of Bourbon. This appearance or the\r\n  repetition at great elevations of certain forms belonging to torrid\r\n  plains calls to mind the group of Alpine palms (Kunthia montana,\r\n  Ceroxylon andicola, and Oreodoxa frigida) of which I have already\r\n  spoken, and a grove of Musaceæ (Heliconia, perhaps Maranta), 16 feet\r\n  high, which I found growing isolated on the Silla de Caracas, at a\r\n  height of more than 7000 feet above the level of the sea.[QI] While\r\n  the form of gramineæ, with the exception of some few herbaceous\r\n  dicotyledons, constitutes the highest phanerogamic zone on the\r\n  snow-crowned summits of mountains, so the grasses mark the boundary of\r\n  phanerogamic vegetation in a horizontal direction, towards the\r\n  northern and southern polar regions.\r\n\r\n  Many admirable general results, no less than a great mass of important\r\n  materials, have been yielded to the geography of plants by my young\r\n  friend, Joseph Hooker, who, after having but recently returned with\r\n  Sir James Boss from the frozen antarctic regions, is now engaged in\r\n  exploring the Thibetian Himalaya. He draws attention to the fact that\r\n  phanerogamic flowering plants (grasses) advance 17½° nearer to the\r\n  north than to the south pole. In the Falkland Islands, near the thick\r\n  knots of Tussac grass, Dactylis cæspitosa, Forster. (a Festuca,\r\n  according to Kunth), and in Tierra del Fuego, under the shade of the\r\n  birch-leaved Fagus antarctica, there grows the same Trisetum\r\n  subspicatum, which spreads over the whole range of the Peruvian Andes,\r\n  and across the Rocky Mountains, to Melville Island, Greenland, and\r\n  Iceland, and is also found in the Swiss and Tyrolese Alps as well as\r\n  in the Altai, in Kamtschatka, and in Campbell’s Island, south of New\r\n  Zealand, extending therefore over 127 degrees of latitude, or from 54°\r\n  south to 72° 50′ north lat. “Few grasses,” says Joseph Hooker,[QJ]\r\n  “have so wide a range as Trisetum subspicatum (Beauv.), nor am I\r\n  acquainted with any other arctic species which is equally an\r\n  inhabitant of the opposite polar regions.” The South Shetland Islands,\r\n  which are separated by Bransfield Straits from d’Urville’s “Terre de\r\n  Louis-Philippe” and from Peak Haddington, a volcano, 7046 feet high,\r\n  and situated in 64° 12′ south lat., have recently been visited by Dr.\r\n  Eights, a botanist from the United States. He found there (probably in\r\n  62° or 62¼° south lat.) a small grass, Aira antarctica,[QK] which is\r\n  “the most antarctic flowering plant hitherto discovered.”\r\n\r\n  Even in Deception Island, belonging to the same group, 62° 50′, only\r\n  lichens are met with, and no longer any species of grass; and in like\r\n  manner further south-east, in Cockburn’s Island (64° 12′) near\r\n  Palmer’s Land, only Lecanoras, Lecideas, and five foliaceous Mosses,\r\n  among which is our German Bryum argenteum, were gathered. “This\r\n  appears to be the Ultima Thule of antarctic vegetation,” for further\r\n  south even terrestrial cryptogamia are wanting. In the great bay\r\n  formed by Victoria Land, on a small island lying opposite to Mount\r\n  Herschel (in 71° 49′ lat.), and on Franklin Island, 92 miles north of\r\n  the volcano, Erebus, (12,366 feet in height), and in 76° 7′ south\r\n  lat., Hooker found no trace of vegetation. In extreme northern\r\n  latitudes, the distribution of even the higher organisms is very\r\n  different; for here phanerogamic plants advance 18½° nearer to the\r\n  pole than in the southern hemisphere. Walden Island (80½° north lat.)\r\n  possesses still ten species of phanerogamia. Antarctic phanerogamic\r\n  vegetation is also poorer in species at equal distances from the pole;\r\n  thus Iceland has five times more phanerogamia than the southern group\r\n  of Auckland and Campbell Islands, but the uniform vegetation of the\r\n  antarctic regions is, from climatic causes, both more succulent and\r\n  more luxuriant.[QL]\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:\r\n\r\n  p. 229—“_Ferns_.”\r\n\r\n  If we estimate the whole number of the cryptogamia hitherto described\r\n  at 19,000 species, as has been done by Dr. Klotzsch, a naturalist\r\n  possessing a profound acquaintance with the Agamic plants, we shall\r\n  have for Fungi 8000 (of which Agarici constitute the eighth part); for\r\n  Lichens, according to J. von Flotow of Hirschberg, and Hampe of\r\n  Blankenburg, at least 1400; for the Algæ 2580; for Mosses and\r\n  Liverworts, according to Carl Müller of Halle, and Dr. Gottsche of\r\n  Hamburgh, 3800; and for Ferns 3250. For this last important result we\r\n  are indebted to the profound investigations made by Professor Kunze of\r\n  Leipzig, on this group of plants. It is a striking fact that the\r\n  family of the Polypodiaceæ alone includes 2165 of the whole number of\r\n  described Filices, whilst other forms, as the Lycopodiacæ and\r\n  Hymenophyllaceæ, number only 350 and 200. There are therefore nearly\r\n  as many described species among Ferns as among Grasses.\r\n\r\n  It is singular that no mention of the beautiful arborescent ferns is\r\n  to be found in the classic authors of antiquity, Theophrastus,\r\n  Dioscorides, and Pliny; while, from the information given by the\r\n  companions of Alexander, Aristobulus, Megasthenes, and Nearchus,\r\n  reference is made[QM] to Bamboos, “quæ fissis internodiis lembi vice\r\n  vectitabant navigates;” to the Indian trees “quarum folia non minora\r\n  clypeo sunt;” to the Fig-tree which takes root from its branches, and\r\n  to Palms, “tantæ proceritatis, ut sagittis superjici nequeant.” I find\r\n  the first mention of arborescent ferns in Oviedo.[QN] “Among ferns,”\r\n  says this experienced traveller, who had been appointed by Ferdinand\r\n  the Catholic, Director of the Goldwashings in Haiti, “there are some\r\n  which I class with trees, because they are as thick and high as\r\n  Pine-trees. (Helechos que yo cuento por arboles, tan gruesos como\r\n  grandes pinos y muy altos). They mostly grow among the mountains and\r\n  where there is much water.” This estimate of their height is\r\n  exaggerated, for in the dense forests near Caripe even our Cyathea\r\n  speciosa only attains a height of 32 to 37 feet; and an admirable\r\n  observer, Ernst Dieffenbach, did not see in the most northern of the\r\n  three islands of New Zealand any trunks of Cyathea dealbata exceeding\r\n  42½ feet. In the Cyathea speciosa and the Meniscium of the Chaymas\r\n  missions, we observed in the midst of the most shady part of the\r\n  primeval forest, that the scaly stems of some of the most luxuriantly\r\n  developed of these trees were covered with a shining carbonaceous\r\n  powder, which appeared to be owing to a singular decomposition of the\r\n  fibrous parts of the old leaf stalks.[QO]\r\n\r\n  Between the tropics, where, on the declivities of the Cordilleras,\r\n  climates are superimposed in strata, the true region of arborescent\r\n  ferns lies between about 3200 and 5350 feet above the level of the\r\n  sea. In South America and in the Mexican highlands they seldom descend\r\n  lower towards the plains than 1280 feet. The mean temperature of this\r\n  happy region is between 64°.6 and 70°.8 Fahr. It reaches the lowest\r\n  stratum of clouds (which floats the nearest to the surface of the sea\r\n  and the plain), and it therefore enjoys uninterruptedly a high degree\r\n  of humidity, together with a great equality in its thermal\r\n  relations.[QP] The inhabitants, who are of Spanish descent, call this\r\n  region “Tierra templada de los helechos.”\r\n\r\n  The Arabic designation for ferns is _feledschun_, filix, (from which\r\n  the _f_ has been changed, according to Spanish usage, into _h_,) and\r\n  perhaps the term may be connected with the verb _faladscha_, “it\r\n  divides,” from the finely cut margin of the frond.[QQ]\r\n\r\n  The conditions of genial mildness in an atmosphere charged with\r\n  aqueous vapour and of great uniformity in respect to moisture and\r\n  warmth, are fulfilled on the declivities of the mountains in the\r\n  valleys of the Andes, and more especially in the southern milder and\r\n  more humid hemisphere, where arborescent ferns advance not only to New\r\n  Zealand and Van Diemen’s Land (Tasmania), but even as far as the\r\n  Straits of Magellan and Campbell Island, and therefore to a southern\r\n  latitude almost identical in degrees with the parallel in which Berlin\r\n  is situated north of the equator. From among the family of arborescent\r\n  ferns there flourishes the vigorous Dicksonia squarrosa, in 46° south\r\n  lat. in Dusky Bay, New Zealand; D. antarctica of Labillardière in\r\n  Tasmania; a Thyrsopteris in the Island of Juan Fernandez; an\r\n  undescribed Dicksonia, whose stem is from 12 to 16 feet high, near\r\n  Valdivia in Southern Chili; and a Lomaria, somewhat less in height, in\r\n  the Straits of Magellan. Campbell Island is still nearer to the south\r\n  pole, in 52½° lat., but even there the leafless stem of the Aspidium\r\n  venustum rises to a height of more than four feet.\r\n\r\n  The climatic relations under which Ferns (_Filices_) in general\r\n  flourish, are manifested in the numerical laws of their quotients of\r\n  distribution. In the plains within the tropical regions of large\r\n  continents this quotient is, according to Robert Brown, and from more\r\n  recent investigations on the subject, ¹⁄₂₀ of all the phanerogamia,\r\n  and in mountainous districts of large continents ⅙ to ⅛. This ratio is\r\n  quite different on the small islands scattered over the ocean; for\r\n  here the proportion borne by the number of ferns to the sum total of\r\n  all the phanerogamic plants increases so considerably, that in the\r\n  South-Sea Islands the quotient rises to ¼, while in the sporadic\r\n  islands, St. Helena and Ascension, the number of ferns is almost equal\r\n  to half of the whole phanerogamic vegetation.[QR] In receding from the\r\n  tropics (where on the large continents d’Urville estimates the\r\n  proportional number at ¹⁄₂₀), the _relative_ frequency of ferns\r\n  decreases rapidly as we advance into the temperate zone. The quotients\r\n  are for North America and the British Islands ¹⁄₃₅, for France ¹⁄₅₈,\r\n  for Germany ¹⁄₅₂, for the dry parts of Southern Italy ¹⁄₇₄, for Greece\r\n  ¹⁄₈₄. The _relative_ frequency again increases considerably towards\r\n  the frigid north. Here the family of ferns decreases much slower in\r\n  the number of its species than does that of phanerogamic plants. The\r\n  luxuriantly aspiring character of the species, and the number of\r\n  individuals contained in each, augment the deceptive impression of\r\n  _absolute_ frequency. According to Wahlemberg’s and Hornemann’s\r\n  catalogues, the relative numbers of the Filices are for Lapland ¹⁄₂₅,\r\n  for Iceland ¹⁄₁₈, for Greenland ¹⁄₁₂.\r\n\r\n  Such are, according to our present knowledge, the natural laws that\r\n  manifest themselves in the distribution of the graceful form of Ferns.\r\n  But it would seem as if in the family of Ferns, which have so long\r\n  been regarded as cryptogamic, we had lately acquired evidence of the\r\n  existence of another natural law,—the morphological law of\r\n  propagation. Count Leszczyc-Suminski, who happily combines the power\r\n  of microscopic investigation with a very remarkable artistic talent,\r\n  has discovered an organisation capable of effecting fructification in\r\n  the prothallium of ferns. He distinguishes two sexual apparatuses, of\r\n  which the female portion is situated in hollow ovate cells in the\r\n  middle of the sporangium, and the male in the ciliated antheridia, or\r\n  the organs producing spiral threads, which have already been examined\r\n  by Nägeli. Fructification is supposed to be effected by means of\r\n  moveable ciliated spiral threads and not by pollen tubes.[QS]\r\n  According to this view, Ferns would be, as Ehrenberg remarks,[QT]\r\n  products of a microscopic fructification taking place on the\r\n  prothallium, which here serves as a fertilizing receptacle, while\r\n  throughout the whole course of their often arborescent development\r\n  they would be flowerless and fruitless plants, having a bud-formation.\r\n  The spores lying as sori on the under side of the frond are not seeds\r\n  but flower-buds.\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:\r\n\r\n  p. 229—“_The Liliaceæ_.”\r\n\r\n  Africa is the principal seat of this form; there the greatest\r\n  diversity obtains; there they form masses and determine the natural\r\n  character of the region. The New Continent exhibits also, it is true,\r\n  magnificent Alströmeriæ and species of Pancratium, Hæmanthus, and\r\n  Crinum. We have enriched the first of these genera with nine, and the\r\n  second with three species; but these American liliaceous plants are\r\n  more diffused and of less social habits than the European Irideæ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  p. 229—“_The Willow Form_.”\r\n\r\n  Nearly 150 different species of the main representatives of this form,\r\n  or rather of the Willow itself, are already known. They cover the\r\n  northern parts of the earth from the equator to Lapland. Their number\r\n  and their varieties of form increase between the 46th and 70th degrees\r\n  of latitude, more especially in that part of northern Europe which has\r\n  been so remarkably indented by the early revolutions of our planet. I\r\n  am acquainted with ten or twelve species of inter-tropical Willows,\r\n  and these, like the Willows of the southern hemisphere, are deserving\r\n  of special attention. As nature appears to delight in all zones in a\r\n  wondrous multiplication of certain animal forms, as for instance,\r\n  Anatidæ (_Lamellirostres_), and Pigeons; so likewise are Willows,\r\n  Pines, and Oaks, widely diffused; the latter always exhibiting a\r\n  similarity in their fruit, although various differences exist in the\r\n  form of the leaves. In Willows belonging to the most widely different\r\n  climates the similarity of the foliage, of the ramification, and of\r\n  the whole physiognomical conformation, is almost greater than in\r\n  Coniferæ. In the more southern part of the temperate zone, north of\r\n  the equator, the number of the species of Willows decreases\r\n  considerably; although (according to the “Flora atlantica” of\r\n  Desfontaines) Tunis has still its own species, resembling Salix\r\n  caprea; whilst Egypt, according to Forskäl, numbers five species, from\r\n  the catkins of whose male blossoms is distilled the remedial agent\r\n  Moie chalaf (_aqua salicis_), so much used in the East. The Willow\r\n  which I saw in the Canaries is also, according to Leopold von Buch and\r\n  Christian Smith, a peculiar species (_S. canariensis_), although\r\n  common to those islands and to Madeira. Wallich’s catalogue of the\r\n  plants of Nepaul and the Himalaya already gives 13 species belonging\r\n  to the subtropical zone of the East Indies, and which have in part\r\n  been described by Don, Roxburgh, and Lindley. Japan has its own\r\n  species, of which one, S. japonica. (Thunb.), is also met with in\r\n  Nepaul as an Alpine plant.\r\n\r\n  There was not, as far as I am aware, any species of Willow known as\r\n  belonging to the tropical zone before my expedition, with the\r\n  exception of S. tetrasperma. We collected seven new species, three of\r\n  them on the plateaux of Mexico, at an elevation of 8500 feet above the\r\n  level of the sea. Still higher, as for instance on the Alpine plains,\r\n  between 12,000 and 15,000 feet, which we frequently visited, we saw\r\n  nothing in the Andes of Mexico, Quito, and Peru, to remind us of the\r\n  many small creeping Alpine Willows of the Pyrenees, the Alps, or of\r\n  Lapland (_S. herbacea_, _S. lanata_, and _S. reticulata_). In\r\n  Spitzbergen, whose meteorological relations have so much analogy with\r\n  those of the snow-crowned summits of Switzerland and Scandinavia,\r\n  Martius described two Dwarf-Willows, whose small woody stems and\r\n  branches trail along the ground, and are so concealed in the turf-bogs\r\n  that it is with difficulty their diminutive leaves can be discovered\r\n  under the moss. The Willow species which I found in 4° 12′ south lat.,\r\n  at the entrance of the Cinchona or Peruvian Bark forests, near Loxa in\r\n  Peru, and which has been described by Willdenow as Salix Humboldtiana,\r\n  is most widely diffused over the western part of South America. A\r\n  Beach-Willow (_S. falcata_), which we discovered on the sandy shores\r\n  of the Pacific, near Truxillo, is, according to Kunth, probably a mere\r\n  variety of the former. In like manner the beautiful and frequently\r\n  pyramidal Willow, which we constantly saw on the banks of the\r\n  Magdalena river, from Mahates to Bojorque, and which, according to the\r\n  report of the natives, had only spread thus far within a few years,\r\n  may also be identical with S. Humboldtiana. At the confluence of the\r\n  Magdalena with the Rio Opon, we found all the islands covered with\r\n  Willows, many of which had stems 64 feet high, with a diameter of from\r\n  only 8 to 10 inches.[QU] Lindley has made us acquainted with a species\r\n  of Salix belonging to Senegal, and therefore to the equinoctial region\r\n  of Africa.[QV] Blume also found two species of Willow near the equator\r\n  in Java, one wild and indigenous in the island (_S. tetrasperma_), and\r\n  another cultivated (_S. Sieboldiana_). I am only acquainted with the\r\n  two Willows belonging to the south temperate zone, which have been\r\n  described by Thunberg (_S. hirsuta_ and _S. mucronata_). They grow\r\n  interspersed with Protea argentea, which has the same physiognomy as\r\n  the Willow, and their leaves and young branches constitute the food of\r\n  the hippopotamus of the Orange River. The family of Willows is\r\n  entirely wanting in Australia and the neighbouring islands.\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  p. 229—“_The Myrtle Form_.”\r\n\r\n  The Myrtle is a graceful plant, with stiff, shining, crowded, and\r\n  generally entire and small leaves marked with dots. Myrtles impart a\r\n  peculiar character to three regions of the earth, viz., to southern\r\n  Europe, more especially to the islands composed of calcareous rocks\r\n  and trachytic stone, which project from the basin of the\r\n  Mediterranean; to the continent of New Holland, which is adorned with\r\n  Eucalyptus, Metrosideros, and Leptospermum; and to an inter-tropical\r\n  region in the Andes of South America, part of which is a low plain,\r\n  while the remainder lies at an elevation of from 9000 to more than\r\n  10,000 feet above the level of the sea. This Alpine region, called in\r\n  Quito the Paramos, is entirely covered with trees having a Myrtle-like\r\n  aspect, even though they may not all belong to the Myrtaceæ. At this\r\n  elevation grow Escalonia myrtilloides, E. tubar, Simplocos Alstonia,\r\n  species of Myrica, and the lovely Myrtus microphylla, of which we have\r\n  given a drawing in our _Plantes équinoxiales_, t. i. p. 21, pl. iv.;\r\n  it grows on micaceous schist, at an elevation of 10,000 feet on the\r\n  Paramo de Saraguru, (near Vinayacu and Alto de Pulla,) which is\r\n  adorned with so many beautiful flowering Alpine plants. M. myrsinoides\r\n  ascends in the Paramo de Guamani as high as 11,200 feet. By far the\r\n  greater number of the 40 species of the genus Myrtus which we\r\n  collected in the equinoctial zone, and of which 37 were undescribed,\r\n  belong to the plains and the less elevated mountain spurs. We brought\r\n  only a single species (_M. xalapensis_) from the mild tropical climate\r\n  of the mountains of Mexico; but the Tierra templada, in the direction\r\n  of the Volcano of Orizaba, no doubt possesses many yet undescribed\r\n  varieties. We found M. maritima near Acapulco, on the very shore of\r\n  the Pacific.\r\n\r\n  The _Escalloniæ_,—among which _E. myrtilloides_, _E. tubar_, _E.\r\n  floribunda_ are the ornaments of the Paramos, and remind us strongly\r\n  (by their physiognomical aspect) of the myrtle-form,—formerly\r\n  constituted, together with the European and South American Alpine\r\n  roses (Rhododendrum and Befaria), with Clethra, Andromeda, and\r\n  Gaylussacia buxifolia, the family of the _Ericeæ_. Robert Brown[QW]\r\n  has arranged them in a special family, which Kunth has placed between\r\n  the Philadelphiæ and Hamamelideæ. Escallonia floribunda affords by its\r\n  geographical distribution one of the most striking examples of the\r\n  relation existing between distance from the equator and vertical\r\n  elevation above the level of the sea. I would here again borrow\r\n  support from the testimony of the accurate observer, my friend Auguste\r\n  de St. Hilaire.[QX] “MM. Humboldt and Bonpland in their expedition\r\n  discovered Escallonia floribunda in 4° south lat. at an elevation of\r\n  8952 feet. I found the same plant in 21° south lat. in Brazil, which\r\n  although elevated is very much less so than the Andes of Peru. This\r\n  plant is of common occurrence between 24° 50′ and 25° 55′ in the\r\n  Campos Geraes, and I also met with it again on the Rio de la Plata in\r\n  about 35° lat., on a level with the sea.”\r\n\r\n  The group of the Myrtaceæ,—to which belong Melaleuca, Metrosideros,\r\n  and Eucalyptus, commonly classed under the general denomination of\r\n  Leptospermeæ,—produce partially, wherever the true leaves are supplied\r\n  by phyllodia (petiole-leaves), or where the direction of the leaves is\r\n  inclined towards the unexpanded petiole, a distribution of streaks of\r\n  light and shade wholly unknown in our deciduous-leaved forest. We find\r\n  that the earliest botanical travellers who visited New Holland were\r\n  astonished at the singular effect thus produced. Robert Brown was the\r\n  first to show that this phenomenon depends on the vertical direction\r\n  of the expanded petioles (the phyllodia of Acacia longifolia and\r\n  Acacia suaveolens), and on the circumstance, that the light, instead\r\n  of falling on horizontal surfaces, passes between vertical ones.[QY]\r\n  Morphological laws in the development of the leaves determine the\r\n  peculiar character of the varying light and shade. “Phyllodia,” says\r\n  Kunth, “can in my opinion merely occur in families which have compound\r\n  pinnate leaves; and in fact they have as yet only been met with in\r\n  Leguminosæ (in the Acacias). In Eucalyptus, Metrosideros, and\r\n  Melaleuca, the leaves are simple (simplicia), and their edgewise\r\n  position depends on a half-turn of the leaf-stalk (petiolus);\r\n  moreover, it must be remarked, that both surfaces of the leaves are of\r\n  a similar character.” In the scantily shaded forests of New Holland\r\n  the optical effects here alluded to are the more frequent, since two\r\n  groups of Myrtaceæ and Leguminosæ, species of Eucalyptus and Acacia,\r\n  there constitute nearly one-half of all the greyish-green tree\r\n  vegetation. Moreover, between the bast-layers of Melaleuca, there are\r\n  formed easily soluble membranes, which force their way outwards, and\r\n  by their whiteness reminds us of our birch bark.\r\n\r\n  The sphere of distribution of the Myrtaceæ is very different in the\r\n  two continents. In the New Continent, and especially in its western\r\n  parts, this family, according to Joseph Hooker,[QZ] scarcely extends\r\n  beyond the parallel of 26° north lat., while in the Southern\r\n  Hemisphere, there are in Chili, according to Claude Gay, ten species\r\n  of Myrtle and twenty-two of Eugenia, which mixed with Proteaceæ\r\n  (Embothrium and Lomatia) and with Fagus obliqua, there constitute\r\n  forests. The Myrtaceæ become more frequent from the 38th degree of\r\n  south lat.; in the island of Chiloe, where a metrosideros-like species\r\n  (Myrtus stipularis) forms almost impenetrable underwood, which is\r\n  there named Tepuales; and in Patagonia to the extremity of Tierra del\r\n  Fuego in 56° lat. While in Europe the Myrtaceæ do not extend northward\r\n  further than 46° lat., they penetrate in Australia, Tasmania, New\r\n  Zealand and the Auckland Islands to 50½° south latitude.\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:\r\n\r\n  p. 229—“_Melastomaceæ_.”\r\n\r\n  This group comprises the genera Melastoma (Fothergilla and Tococa Aub.\r\n  and Rhexia (Meriana and Osbeckia), of which we have collected no less\r\n  than sixty new species in tropical America alone, on both sides of the\r\n  equator. Bonpland has published a splendid work on the Melastomaceæ,\r\n  in two volumes, with coloured plates. There are species of Rhexia and\r\n  Melastoma which ascend in the chain of the Andes, as Alpine or Paramos\r\n  shrubs, to 9600 and even more than 11,000 feet above the level of the\r\n  sea; as for instance Rhexia cernua, R. stricta, Melastoma obscurum, M.\r\n  aspergillare, and M. lutescens.\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:\r\n\r\n  p. 229—“_The Laurel-form_.”\r\n\r\n  To this form belong Laurus, Persea, the Ocoteæ, so numerous\r\n  in South America, and,—on account of their physiognomic\r\n  similarity,—Calophyllum, also the splendidly aspiring Mammea from the\r\n  Guttiferæ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:\r\n\r\n  p. 229—“_How instructive to the landscape-painter would be a work\r\n  which should illustrate the leading forms of vegetation_.”\r\n\r\n  In order to define with more distinctness what I have here only\r\n  briefly referred to, I may be permitted to incorporate the following\r\n  considerations from my sketch of a history of landscape painting, and\r\n  of a graphical representation of the physiognomy of plants.[RA]\r\n\r\n  “All that relates to the expression of the passions and the beauty of\r\n  the human form has perhaps attained its fullest development in the\r\n  temperate northern zone under the skies of Greece and Italy. The\r\n  artist, drawing from the depths of imagination, no less than from the\r\n  contemplation of beings of his own species, derives the types of\r\n  historical painting alike from unfettered creation and from truthful\r\n  imitation. Landscape painting, though scarcely a more imitative art,\r\n  has a more material basis, and a more earthly tendency. It requires\r\n  for its development a greater amount of various and distinct\r\n  impressions, which, when imbibed from external contemplation, must be\r\n  fertilized by the powers of the mind in order to be presented to the\r\n  senses of others as a creative work of art. The grander style of\r\n  heroic landscape-painting is the combined result of a profound\r\n  appreciation of nature, and of this inward process of the mind.\r\n\r\n  “Everywhere, in every separate portion of the earth, nature is indeed\r\n  only a reflex of the whole. The forms of organization recur again and\r\n  again in different combinations. Even the icy north is cheered for\r\n  months together by the presence of herbs and large Alpine blossoms\r\n  covering the earth, and by a mild azure sky. Hitherto landscape\r\n  painting among us has pursued her graceful labours familiar only with\r\n  the simpler forms of our native floras, but not therefore without\r\n  depth of feeling and richness of creative fancy. Dwelling only on the\r\n  native and indigenous form of our vegetation, this branch of art,\r\n  notwithstanding that it has been circumscribed by such narrow limits,\r\n  has yet afforded sufficient scope for highly-gifted painters, such as\r\n  the Caracci, Gaspar Poussin, Claude Lorraine, and Ruysdael, to produce\r\n  the happiest and most varied creations of art, by their magical power\r\n  of managing the grouping of trees, and the effects of light and shade.\r\n  That progress which may still be expected in art, from a more animated\r\n  intercourse with the tropical world, and from ideas engendered in the\r\n  mind of the artist by the contemplation of Nature in her grandest\r\n  forms, will never diminish the fame of the old masters. I have alluded\r\n  to this, to recal the ancient bond which unites a knowledge of Nature\r\n  with poetry and a taste for art. For in landscape painting, as in\r\n  every other branch of art, a distinction must be drawn between the\r\n  elements generated by a limited field of contemplation and direct\r\n  observation, and those which spring from the boundless depth of\r\n  feeling, and from the force of idealising mental power. The grand\r\n  conceptions which landscape painting, as a more or less inspired\r\n  branch of the poetry of nature, owes to the creative power of the\r\n  mind, are, like man himself, and the imaginative faculties with which\r\n  he is endowed, independent of place. These remarks especially refer to\r\n  the gradations in the form of trees from Ruysdael and Everdingen,\r\n  through the works of Claude Lorraine, to Poussin and Annibal Caracci.\r\n  In the great masters of art there is no indication of local\r\n  limitation. But an extension of the visible horizon, and an\r\n  acquaintance with the nobler and grander forms of nature, and with the\r\n  luxuriant fulness of life in tropical regions, afford the advantage of\r\n  not simply enriching the material groundwork of landscape-painting,\r\n  but also of inducing more vivid impressions in the minds of less\r\n  highly gifted painters, and thus heightening their powers of artistic\r\n  creation.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 105:\r\n\r\n  p. 230—“_From the thick and rough bark of the Crescentiæ and\r\n  Gustaviæ_.”\r\n\r\n  In _Crescentia Cujete_ (the Tutuma tree, whose large fruit-shells are\r\n  so indispensable to the natives as household utensils), in\r\n  _Cynometra_, the Cacao-tree (_Theobroma_), and the _Perigara Gustavia_\r\n  (Linn.), the tender blossoms burst forth from the half-carbonized\r\n  bark. When children eat the fruit of the _Pirigara speciosa_ (the\r\n  _Chupo_), their whole bodies become tinged with yellow; and this\r\n  jaundice, after a continuance of from twenty-four to thirty-six hours,\r\n  disappears without the use of medicine.\r\n\r\n  An indelible impression was produced on my mind by the luxuriant power\r\n  of vegetation in the tropical world, when, on entering a Cacao\r\n  plantation (_Caca hual_), in the Valles de Aragua, after a damp night,\r\n  I saw for the first time large blossoms springing from the root of a\r\n  _Theobroma_, deeply imbedded in the black soil. This is one of the\r\n  most instantaneous manifestations of the activity of the vegetative\r\n  force of organisation. Northern nations speak of “the awakening of\r\n  Nature at the first genial breath of Spring;”—expressions that\r\n  strongly contrast with the imaginative complaint of the Stagirite, who\r\n  regarded vegetable forms as buried in a “still sleep, from which there\r\n  is no awakening, and free from the desires that excite to spontaneous\r\n  motion.”[RB]\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:\r\n\r\n  p. 230—“_Draw on their heads as caps_.”\r\n\r\n  These are the flowers of our _Aristolochia cordata_, to which\r\n  reference has been made in Illustration 25. The largest flowers in the\r\n  world, besides those belonging to the Compositæ (the Mexican\r\n  _Helianthus annuus_), are produced by _Rafflesia Arnoldi_,\r\n  _Aristolochia_, _Datura_, _Barringtonia_, _Gustavia_, _Carolinea_,\r\n  _Lecythis_, _Nymphæa_, _Nelumbium_, _Victoria Regina_, _Magnolia_,\r\n  _Cactus_, the Orchideæ, and the Liliaceous forms.\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  p. 231—“_The luminous worlds which spangle the firmament from pole to\r\n  pole_.”\r\n\r\n  The more magnificent portion of the southern sky, in which shine the\r\n  constellations of the Centaur, Argo, and the Southern Cross, where the\r\n  Magellanic clouds shed their pale light, is for ever concealed from\r\n  the eyes of the inhabitants of Europe. It is only under the equator\r\n  that man enjoys the glorious spectacle of _all_ the stars of the\r\n  southern and northern heavens revealed at one glance. Some of our\r\n  northern constellations,—as, for instance, Ursus Major and Ursus\r\n  Minor,—owing to their low position when seen from the region of the\r\n  equator, appear to be of a remarkable, almost fearful magnitude. As\r\n  the inhabitant of the tropics beholds _all_ stars, so too, in regions\r\n  where plains, deep valleys, and lofty mountains are alternated, does\r\n  Nature surround him with representatives of every form of vegetation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  In the foregoing sketch of a “Physiognomy of Plants,” I have\r\n  endeavoured to keep in view three nearly allied subjects,—_the\r\n  absolute diversity of forms_; their _numerical_ relations, _i.e._\r\n  their local preponderance in the whole number of phanerogamic floras;\r\n  and their _geographical and climatic distribution_. If we would rise\r\n  to a general view regarding vital forms;—the physiognomy, the study of\r\n  the numerical relations (the arithmetic of botany), and the geography\r\n  of plants (the study of the local zones of distribution), cannot, as\r\n  it seems to me, be separated from one another. The study of the\r\n  physiognomy of plants must not be exclusively directed to the\r\n  consideration of the striking contrasts of form which the larger\r\n  organisms present, when considered separately; but it must rise to the\r\n  recognition of the laws which determine _physiognomy of nature\r\n  generally_, the picturesque character of vegetation over the whole\r\n  surface of the earth, and the vivid impression produced by the\r\n  grouping of contrasted forms in different zones of latitude and\r\n  elevation. It is when concentrated into this focus that we first\r\n  clearly perceive the close and intimate connection existing between\r\n  the subjects treated of in the preceding pages. We have here entered\r\n  upon a field of inquiry hitherto but little cultivated. I have\r\n  ventured to follow the method first propounded with such brilliant\r\n  results in Aristotle’s zoological works, and which is so especially\r\n  adapted to establish scientific confidence,—a method in which the\r\n  incessant effort to arrive at a generalisation of ideas supported by\r\n  individual illustrations, is associated with an endeavour to penetrate\r\n  to the specialities of phenomena.\r\n\r\n  The enumeration of forms is, from the physiognomical difference of\r\n  their nature, incapable of any strict classification. Here, as\r\n  everywhere in the consideration of external forms, there are certain\r\n  main types which present the strongest contrasts,—as the groups of the\r\n  Arborescent Grasses, the Aloe form and the species of Cactus, Palms,\r\n  Acicular-leaved trees, Mimosaceæ, and Bananas. Even scantily dispersed\r\n  individuals belonging to these groups determine the character of a\r\n  district, and produce a lasting impression on the mind of the\r\n  unscientific but susceptible beholder. Other forms, perhaps more\r\n  numerous and preponderating, may not appear equally marked either by\r\n  the shape or position of the leaves; the relation of the stem to the\r\n  branches, luxuriant vigour, animation, and grace; or even by the\r\n  melancholy contraction of the leaf-organs.\r\n\r\n  As, therefore, a physiognomical classification, or a distribution into\r\n  groups according to external appearance, does not admit of being\r\n  applied to the whole vegetable kingdom collectively, the basis on\r\n  which such a classification should be grounded must necessarily be\r\n  wholly different from that which has been so happily chosen for the\r\n  establishment of our comprehensive systems of the natural families of\r\n  plants. Vegetable physiognomy grounds its divisions and the choice of\r\n  its types on all that possesses mass,—as the stem, branches, and\r\n  appendicular organs (the form, position, and size of the leaf, the\r\n  character and brilliancy of the parenchyma), and consequently on all\r\n  that is now included under the special term, _the organs of\r\n  vegetation_, and on which depend the preservation (nourishment and\r\n  development) of the individual; while systematic botany, on the other\r\n  hand, bases the arrangement of the natural families of plants on a\r\n  consideration of the organs of propagation, on which depends the\r\n  preservation of the species.[RC] It was already taught in the school\r\n  of Aristotle,[RD] that the generation of seed is the ultimate aim of\r\n  the being and life of a plant. The process of development in the\r\n  organs of fructification has become, since Caspar Fried. Wolf,[RE] and\r\n  our great poet Goëthe, the morphological basis of all systematic\r\n  botany.\r\n\r\n  This science and that also of vegetable physiognomy proceed, I would\r\n  here again observe, from two different points of view; the former\r\n  depending upon an accordance in the inflorescence and in the\r\n  reproduction of the delicate sexual organs; the latter on the\r\n  conformation of the parts constituting the axes (the stem and\r\n  branches) and on the outline of the leaves, which are mainly\r\n  determined by the distribution of the vascular bundles. As, moreover,\r\n  the stem and branches, together with their appendicular organs,\r\n  predominate by mass and volume, they determine and strengthen the\r\n  impression we receive, while they individualize the physiognomical\r\n  character of the vegetation, as well as that of the landscape or the\r\n  zone in which some distinguished types occur. The law is here\r\n  expressed by the accordance and affinity in the marks appertaining to\r\n  the vegetative, _i.e._ the nutritient organs. In all European colonies\r\n  the inhabitants have been led by resemblances of physiognomy\r\n  (_habitus_, _facies_) to apply the names of European forms to certain\r\n  tropical plants, which bear wholly different flowers and fruits from\r\n  the genera to which these designations originally referred. Everywhere\r\n  in both hemispheres, the northern settler has believed he could\r\n  recognise Alders, Poplars, Apple and Olive trees; being misled for the\r\n  most part by the form of the leaves and the direction of the branches.\r\n  The charm associated with the remembrance of native forms has\r\n  strengthened the illusion, and European names of plants have thus been\r\n  perpetuated from generation to generation in the slave colonies, where\r\n  they have been further enriched by denominations borrowed from the\r\n  negro languages.\r\n\r\n  A remarkable phenomenon is presented by the contrast frequently\r\n  observed to arise from a striking accordance in physiognomy, coupled\r\n  with the greatest difference in the organs of inflorescence and\r\n  fructification—between the external form as determined by the\r\n  appendicular or leaf-system, and the sexual organs on which are based\r\n  the various groups of the natural systems of botany. One would be\r\n  disposed _à priori_ to believe that the aspect of vegetative organs\r\n  (leaves) exclusively so called, must depend upon the structure of the\r\n  organs of reproduction, but this dependence has only been observed in\r\n  a very small number of families, as Ferns, Grasses, Cyperaceæ, Palms,\r\n  Coniferæ, Umbelliferæ, and Aroideæ. In the Leguminosæ this accordance\r\n  between the physiognomical character and the inflorescence can\r\n  scarcely be recognized, excepting where they are separated into groups\r\n  (as Papilionaceæ, Cæsalpinineæ, and Mimosaceæ.) The types which\r\n  exhibit, when compared together, a very different structure of\r\n  inflorescence and fructification, notwithstanding external accordance\r\n  in physiognomy, are Palms and Cycadeæ, the latter being most nearly\r\n  allied to the Coniferæ; _Cucusta_, belonging to the Convolvulaceæ, and\r\n  the leafless _Cassytha_, a parasitical Laurinea; _Equisetum_ (from the\r\n  division of the Cryptogamia) and _Ephedra_ (a coniferous tree). The\r\n  Grossulareæ (_Ribes_) are so nearly allied by their efflorescence to\r\n  Cactuses, _i. e._ the family of the Opuntiaceæ, that it is only very\r\n  lately that they have been separated from them! One common family\r\n  (that of the Asphodeleæ) comprises the gigantic tree, _Dracœna Draco_,\r\n  the Common Asparagus, and the coloured flowering _Aletris_. Simple and\r\n  compound leaves frequently belong not only to the same family, but\r\n  even to the same genus. We found in the elevated plateaux of Peru and\r\n  New Granada among twelve new species of _Weinmannia_, five with\r\n  simple, and the remainder with pinnate leaves. The genus _Aralia_\r\n  exhibits yet greater independence in the leaf-form, which is either\r\n  simple, entire, lobed, digitate, or pinnate.[RF]\r\n\r\n  Pinnate leaves appear to me to belong especially to those families\r\n  which occupy the highest grade of organic development, as for\r\n  instance, the _Polypetalœ_; among _perigynic_ plants, the Leguminosæ,\r\n  Rosaceæ, Terebinthaceæ, and Juglandeæ; among _hypogynic_ plants the\r\n  Aurantiaceæ, Cedrelaceæ, and Sapindaceæ. The elegant form of the\r\n  doubly pinnate leaf, which constitutes so great an adornment of the\r\n  torrid zone, is most frequently met with among the Leguminosæ; among\r\n  the Mimosaceæ, and also among some Cæsalpinias, Coulterias and\r\n  Gleditschias; but never, as Kunth has observed, among the\r\n  Papilionaceæ.\r\n\r\n  The form of pinnate, and more especially of compound leaves, is\r\n  unknown in Gentianeæ, Rubiaceæ, and Myrtaceæ. In the morphological\r\n  development presented by the richness and varied aspect of the\r\n  appendicular organs of dicotyledons, we are only able to recognize a\r\n  very small number of general laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ON THE\r\n                      STRUCTURE AND MODE OF ACTION\r\n                                   OF\r\n                                VOLCANOS\r\n                    IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n (This Memoir was read at a Public Meeting of the Academy, at Berlin, on\r\n                         the 24th January, 1823.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the influence exerted on the study of nature during the\r\nlast few centuries, by the extension of geographical knowledge and by\r\nmeans of scientific expeditions to remote regions of the earth, we are\r\nat once made sensible of the various character of this influence,\r\naccording as the investigations have been directed to the forms of the\r\norganic world, the study of the inorganic crust of the earth, or to the\r\nknowledge of rocks, their relative ages, and their origin. Different\r\nvegetable and animal developments exist in every division of the earth,\r\nwhether it be on the plains, where, on a level with the sea, the\r\ntemperature varies with the latitude and with the various inflections of\r\nthe isothermal lines, or on the steep declivity of mountain ranges,\r\nwarmed by the direct rays of the sun. Organic nature imparts to every\r\nregion of the globe its own characteristic physiognomy. But this does\r\nnot apply to the inorganic crust of the earth divested of its vegetable\r\ncovering, for everywhere, in both hemispheres, from the equator to the\r\npoles, the same rocks are found grouped with some relation to each\r\nother, either of attraction or repulsion. In distant lands, surrounded\r\nby strange forms of vegetation, and beneath a sky beaming with other\r\nstars than those to which his eye had been accustomed, the mariner often\r\nrecognises, with joyful surprise, argillaceous schists and rocks\r\nfamiliar to him in his native land.\r\n\r\nThis independence of geological relations on the actual condition of\r\nclimates does not diminish the beneficial influence exercised on the\r\nprogress of mineralogy and physical geognosy by the numerous\r\nobservations instituted in distant regions of the earth, but simply\r\ngives a particular direction to them. Every expedition enriches natural\r\nhistory with new genera of plants and animals. At one time we acquire a\r\nknowledge of new organic forms which are allied to types long familiar\r\nto us, and which not unfrequently, by furnishing links till then\r\ndeficient, enable us to establish, in all its original perfection, an\r\nuninterrupted chain of natural structures. At another time we become\r\nacquainted with isolated structures, which appear either as the remains\r\nof extinct genera, or members of unknown groups, the discovery of which\r\nstimulates further research. It is not, however, from the investigation\r\nof the earth’s crust that we acquire these manifold additions to our\r\nknowledge, for here we meet rather with an uniformity in the constituent\r\nparts, in the superposition of dissimilar masses, and in their regular\r\nrecurrence, which cannot fail to excite the surprise and admiration of\r\nthe geologist. In the chain of the Andes, as in the mountains of Central\r\nEurope, one formation appears, as it were, to call forth another. Masses\r\nidentical in character assume the same forms; basalt and dolerite\r\ncompose twin mountains; dolomite, sandstone, and porphyry form abrupt\r\nrocky walls; while vitreous trachyte, containing a large proportion of\r\nfeldspar, rises in bell-shaped and high-vaulted domes. In the most\r\nremote regions large crystals are separated in a similar manner from the\r\ncompact texture of the fundamental mass, and, blending and grouping\r\ntogether into subordinate strata, frequently announce the commencement\r\nof new and independent formations. It is thus that the inorganic world\r\nmay be said to reflect itself, more or less distinctly, in every\r\nmountain of any great extent. It is necessary, however, in order\r\nperfectly to understand the most important phenomena of the composition,\r\nrelative age, and origin of formations, to compare together the\r\nobservations made in regions of the earth most widely remote from each\r\nother. Problems which have long baffled the geologist in his own\r\nnorthern region, find their solution in the vicinity of the equator. If,\r\nas we have already observed, remote regions do not present us with new\r\nformations, that is to say, with unknown groupings of simple substances,\r\nthey at least help us to unravel the great and universal laws of nature,\r\nby showing how different strata of the crust of the earth are mutually\r\nsuperimposed on, and intersect, each other in the form of veins, or rise\r\nto different elevations in obedience to elastic forces.\r\n\r\nAlthough our geological knowledge may be thus extensively augmented by\r\nresearches over vast regions, it can hardly be a matter of surprise that\r\nthe class of phenomena constituting the principal subject of this\r\naddress should have been so long examined in an imperfect manner, since\r\nthe means of comparison were of difficult, and almost, it may be said,\r\nof laborious access.\r\n\r\nUntil towards the close of the eighteenth century all that was known of\r\nthe form of volcanos and of the action of their subterranean forces was\r\nderived from observations made on two volcanic mountains of Southern\r\nItaly, Vesuvius and Etna. As the former of these was the more\r\naccessible, and (like all volcanos of slight elevation) had frequent\r\neruptions, a hill became to a certain degree the type according to which\r\na whole world—the mighty volcanos of Mexico, South America, and the\r\nAsiatic Islands—was supposed to be formed. Such a mode of reasoning\r\ninvoluntarily calls to mind Virgil’s shepherd, who believed that in his\r\nown humble cot he saw the image of the eternal city, Imperial Rome.\r\n\r\nThis imperfect mode of studying nature might indeed have been obviated\r\nby a more attentive examination of the whole Mediterranean, and\r\nespecially of its eastern islands and littoral districts, where mankind\r\nfirst awoke to intellectual culture and to a higher standard of feeling.\r\nAmong the Sporades, trachytic rocks have risen from the bottom of the\r\nsea, and have formed lands similar to those of the Azores, which in the\r\ncourse of three centuries have appeared periodically at three almost\r\nequal intervals of time. Between Epidaurus and Trœzene, near Methone, in\r\nthe Peloponnesus, there is a Monte Nuovo, described by Strabo and since\r\nby Dodwell. Its elevation is greater than that of the Monte Nuovo of the\r\nPhlegræan fields near Baiæ, and perhaps even than that of the new\r\nvolcano of Xorullo, in the plains of Mexico, which I found to be\r\nsurrounded by many thousand small basaltic cones, upheaved from the\r\nearth, and still emitting smoke. It is not only in the basin of the\r\nMediterranean, that volcanic fires escape from the permanent craters of\r\nisolated mountains having a constant communication with the interior of\r\nthe earth, as Stromboli, Vesuvius, and Etna; for at Ischia, and on Mount\r\nEpomeus, and also, according to the accounts of the ancients, in the\r\nLelantine plain, near Chalcis, lavas have flowed from fissures which\r\nhave suddenly opened on the surface of the earth. Besides these\r\nphenomena, which fall within historical periods, that is, within the\r\nnarrow bounds of authentic tradition, and which Ritter purposes\r\ncollecting and explaining in his masterly work on geography, the shores\r\nof the Mediterranean present numerous remains of the earlier action of\r\nfire. The south of France exhibits in Auvergne a distinct and peculiar\r\nsystem of volcanos, linearly arranged, trachytic domes alternating with\r\ncones of eruption, emitting lava streams in the form of bands. The\r\nplains of Lombardy, which are on a level with the sea, and constitute\r\nthe innermost bay of the Adriatic, inclose the trachyte of the Euganean\r\nHills, where rise domes of granular trachyte, obsidian, and pearl-stone.\r\nThese masses are developed from each other, and break through the lower\r\nchalk formations and nummulitic limestone, but have never been emitted\r\nin narrow streams. Similar evidence of former revolutions of our earth,\r\nis afforded in many parts of the Greek Continent and in Western Asia,\r\ncountries which will undoubtedly some day yield the geologist ample\r\nmaterials for investigation, when the light of knowledge shall again\r\nshine on those lands whence it first dawned on our western world, and\r\nwhen oppressed humanity shall cease to groan beneath the weight of\r\nTurkish barbarism.\r\n\r\nI allude to the geographical proximity of such numerous and various\r\nphenomena in order to show that the basin of the Mediterranean, with its\r\nseries of islands, might have enabled the attentive observer to note all\r\nthose phenomena which have recently been discovered under various forms\r\nand structures in South America, Teneriffe, and in the Aleutian islands,\r\nnear the Polar region. The materials for observation were, no doubt,\r\naccumulated within a narrow compass; but it was yet necessary that\r\ntravels in distant countries and comparisons between extensive tracts of\r\nland, both in and out of Europe, should be undertaken, in order to\r\nobtain a correct idea of the resemblance between volcanic phenomena and\r\nof their dependence on each other.\r\n\r\nLanguage, which so frequently imparts permanence and authority to first,\r\nand often also erroneous views, but which points, as it were,\r\ninstinctively to the truth, has applied the term _volcanic_ to all\r\neruptions of subterranean fire and molten matter; to columns of smoke\r\nand vapour which ascend sporadically from rocks, as at Colares, after\r\nthe great earthquake of Lisbon; to Salses, or argillaceous cones\r\nemitting moist mud, asphalt, and hydrogen, as at Girgenti in Sicily, and\r\nat Turbaco in South America; to hot Geyser springs, which rise under the\r\npressure of elastic vapours; and, in general, to all operations of\r\nimpetuous natural forces which have their seat deep in the interior of\r\nour planet. In Central America (Guatimala) and in the Philippine\r\nIslands, the natives even formally distinguish between _Volcanes de agua\r\ny de fuego_, volcanos emitting water, and those emitting fire;\r\ndesignating by the former appellation, mountains from which subterranean\r\nwaters burst forth from time to time, accompanied by a dull hollow sound\r\nand violent earthquakes.\r\n\r\nWithout denying the connection, which undoubtedly exists among the\r\nphenomena just referred to, it would seem advisable to apply more\r\ndefinite terms to the physical as well as to the mineralogical portion\r\nof the science of geology, and not at one time to designate by the word\r\n_volcano_ a mountain terminating in a permanent fire-emitting mouth, and\r\nat another to apply it to any subterranean cause, be it what it may, of\r\nvolcanic action. In the present condition of our earth, the form of\r\nisolated conical mountains (as those of Vesuvius, Etna, the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe, Tunguragua and Cotopaxi) is certainly the shape most commonly\r\nobserved in volcanos. I have myself seen such volcanos varying in height\r\nfrom the most inconsiderable hill to an elevation of more than 19,000\r\nfeet above the level of the sea. Besides such conical forms, however, we\r\ncontinually meet with permanent fire-emitting mouths, in which the\r\ncommunication with the interior of the earth is maintained on\r\nfar-extended jagged ridges, and not even always from the centre of their\r\nmural summits, but at their extremity towards their slope. Such, for\r\ninstance, is Pichincha, situated between the Pacific and the city of\r\nQuito, which has acquired celebrity from Bouguer’s earliest barometric\r\nformulæ, and such are the volcanos on the Steppe de los Pastos, situate\r\nat more than 10,000 feet above the level of the sea. All these variously\r\nshaped summits consist of trachyte, formerly known as trap-porphyry; a\r\ngranular stone full of narrow fissures, composed of different kinds of\r\nfeldspar (labradorite, oligoklase, and albite), augite, hornblende, and\r\nsometimes interspersed mica, and even quartz. Wherever the evidences of\r\nthe first eruption, the ancient structures—if I may use the\r\nexpression—remain complete, the isolated cone is surrounded,\r\ncircus-like, with a high wall of rock consisting of different\r\nsuperimposed strata, encompassing it like an outer sheath. Such walls or\r\ncircular inclosures are termed _craters of elevation_, and constitute a\r\ngreat and important phenomenon, upon which that eminent geologist,\r\nLeopold von Buch, from whose writings I have borrowed many facts\r\nadvanced in this treatise, presented so remarkable a paper to our\r\nAcademy five years ago.\r\n\r\nVolcanos which communicate with the atmosphere by means of fire-emitting\r\nmouths, such as conical basaltic hills, and dome-like craterless\r\ntrachytic mountains, (the latter being sometimes low, like the Sarcouy,\r\nand sometimes high, like the Chimborazo,) form various groups.\r\nComparative geography draws our attention, at one time, to small\r\nArchipelagos or independent mountain-systems, with craters and lava\r\nstreams, like those in the Canary Isles and the Azores, and without\r\ncraters or true lava streams, as in the Euganean hills, and the\r\nSiebengebirge near Bonn; at another time, it makes us acquainted with\r\nvolcanos arranged in single or double chains, and extending for many\r\nhundred miles in length, either running parallel with the main direction\r\nof the range, as in Guatimala, Peru, and Java, or intersecting its axis\r\nat right angles, as in tropical Mexico. In this land of the Aztecs\r\nfire-emitting trachytic mountains alone attain the high snow limit: they\r\nare ranged in the direction of a parallel of latitude, and have probably\r\nbeen upheaved from a chasm extending over upwards of 420 miles,\r\nintersecting the whole continent from the Pacific to the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThis crowding together of volcanos, either in rounded groups or double\r\nlines, affords the most convincing proof that their action does not\r\ndepend on slight causes located near the surface, but that they are\r\ngreat and deep-seated phenomena. The whole of the eastern portion of the\r\nAmerican continent, which is poor in metals, has in its present\r\ncondition no fire-emitting openings, no trachytic masses, and perhaps no\r\nbasalt containing olivine. All the volcanos of America are united in the\r\nportion of the continent opposite to Asia, along the chain of the Andes,\r\nwhich runs nearly due north and south over a distance of more than 7200\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe whole elevated table-land of Quito, which is surmounted by the high\r\nmountains of Pichincha, Cotopaxi, and Tunguragua, constitutes one sole\r\nvolcanic hearth. The subterranean fire bursts sometimes from one and\r\nsometimes from another of these openings, which have generally been\r\nregarded as independent volcanos. The progressive movement of the fire\r\nhas, for three centuries, inclined from north to south. Even the\r\nearthquakes, which so fearfully devastate this portion of the globe,\r\nafford striking evidence of the existence of subterranean\r\ncommunications, not only between countries where there are no\r\nvolcanos—as has long been known—but likewise between volcanic apertures\r\nsituated at a distance from each other. Thus the volcano of Pasto, east\r\nof the river Guaytara, continued during three months of the year 1797,\r\nto emit, uninterruptedly, a lofty column of smoke, until it suddenly\r\nceased at the moment of the great earthquake of Riobamba, (at a distance\r\nof 240 miles,) and the mud eruption of the “Moya,” in which from thirty\r\nto forty thousand Indians perished.\r\n\r\nThe sudden appearance, on the 30th of January, 1811, of the island of\r\nSabrina, in the group of the Azores, was the precursor of the dreadful\r\nearthquakes which, further westward, shook, from May, 1811, to June,\r\n1813, almost uninterruptedly, first the Antilles, then the plains of the\r\nOhio and Mississippi, and lastly, the opposite coasts of Venezuela or\r\nCaracas. Thirty days after the total destruction of the beautiful\r\ncapital of the province, there was an eruption of the long inactive\r\nvolcano of St. Vincent, in the neighbouring islands of the Antilles. A\r\nremarkable phenomenon accompanied this eruption: at the moment of this\r\nexplosion, which occurred on the 30th of April, 1811, a terrible\r\nsubterranean noise was heard in South America, over a district of more\r\nthan 35,000 square miles. The inhabitants of the banks of the Apure, at\r\nthe confluence of the Rio Nula, and those living on the remote sea-coast\r\nof Venezuela, agreed in comparing this sound to the noise of heavy\r\nartillery. The distance from the confluence of the Rio Nula with the\r\nApure (by which I entered the Orinoco) to the volcano of St. Vincent,\r\nmeasured in a straight line, is no less than 628 miles. This noise was\r\ncertainly not propagated through the air, and must have arisen from some\r\ndeep-seated subterranean cause; its intensity was, moreover, hardly\r\ngreater on the shores of the Caribbean sea, near the seat of the raging\r\nvolcano, than in the interior of the country in the basin of the Apure\r\nand the Orinoco.\r\n\r\nIt would be useless to multiply examples of this nature, by adducing\r\nothers which I have collected: I will therefore only refer to one\r\nfurther instance, namely, the memorable earthquake of Lisbon, an\r\nimportant phenomenon in the annals of Europe. Simultaneously with this\r\nevent, which took place on the 1st of November, 1755, not only were the\r\nLakes of Switzerland and the sea off the Swedish coasts violently\r\nagitated, but in the eastern portion of the Antilles, near the islands\r\nof Martinique, Antigua, and Barbadoes, the tide, which never exceeds\r\nthirty inches, suddenly rose upwards of twenty feet. All these phenomena\r\nprove, that subterranean forces are manifested either dynamically,\r\nexpansively, and attended by commotion, in earthquakes; or possess the\r\nproperty of producing, or of chemically modifying substances in\r\nvolcanos; and they further show, that these forces are not seated near\r\nthe surface in the thin crust of the earth, but deep in the interior of\r\nour planet, whence through fissures and unfilled veins they act\r\nsimultaneously at widely distant points of the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nThe more varied the structure of volcanos, that is to say, of elevations\r\ninclosing a channel through which the molten masses of the interior of\r\nthe earth reach the surface, the more important it is to form a correct\r\nidea of these structures by careful measurement. The interest derived\r\nfrom measurements of this kind, which I made a special subject of\r\ninquiry in the western hemisphere, is increased by the consideration,\r\nthat the objects to be measured vary in magnitude at different points. A\r\nphilosophical study of nature seeks, in considering the changes of\r\nphenomena, to connect the present with the past.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain the periodic recurrence, or the laws of the\r\nprogressive changes in nature, we require certain fixed points, and\r\ncarefully conducted observations, which, by their connection with\r\ndefinite epochs, may serve as a basis for numerical comparisons. If the\r\nmean temperature of the atmosphere and of the earth in different\r\nlatitudes, or the mean height of the barometer at the sea level, had\r\nbeen determined only once in every thousand years, we should know to\r\nwhat extent the heat of climates has increased or diminished, and\r\nwhether any changes have taken place in the height of the atmosphere.\r\nSuch points of comparison are especially required to determine the\r\ninclination and declination of the magnetic needle, and the intensity of\r\nthose electro-magnetic forces on which Seebeck and Erman, two admirable\r\nphysicists belonging to this Academy, have thrown so much light. If it\r\nbe a meritorious undertaking on the part of learned societies to\r\ninvestigate with perseverance the cosmical changes in the heat and\r\npressure of the atmosphere, and particularly the magnetic direction and\r\nintensity, it is no less the duty of the travelling geologist to direct\r\nattention to the varying height of volcanos in determining the\r\ninequalities of the earth’s surface. The observations which I formerly\r\nmade in the Mexican mountains, at the volcano of Toluca, at\r\nPopocatepetl, at the Cofre de Perote, or Nauhcampatepetl, and Xorullo,\r\nand in the Andes of Quito at Pichincha, I have had opportunities since\r\nmy return to Europe of repeating, at different periods, on Mount\r\nVesuvius. Where complete trigonometric or barometric measurements are\r\nwanting, their place may be supplied by angles of altitude laid down\r\nwith precision, and taken at points accurately determined. The\r\ncomparison of such determinations, made at different periods of time,\r\nmay sometimes be even preferable to the complication of more complete\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nSaussure measured Vesuvius in 1773, and at that time both the\r\nnorth-western and south-eastern margins of the crater appeared to him to\r\nbe equal in height. He found their elevation above the level of the sea\r\nto be 3894 feet. The eruption of 1794 occasioned a falling in towards\r\nthe south, and an inequality in the margins of the crater, which may be\r\ndistinguished from a considerable distance even by the most unpractised\r\neye. Leopold von Buch, Gay Lussac, and myself, measured Mount Vesuvius\r\nthree times in the year 1805, and found that the elevation of the\r\nnorthern margin, la Rocca del Palo, opposite the Somma, was exactly as\r\nit had been given by Saussure, while the southern margin was 479 feet\r\nlower than it had been in 1773. The elevation of the volcano itself\r\ntowards Torre del Greco (the side towards which, for thirty years, the\r\nvolcanic action has been principally directed) had, at that time,\r\ndecreased one-eighth. The cone of cinders bears to the total height of\r\nVesuvius the relation of 1 : 3; in Pichincha, the ratio is as 1 : 10,\r\nand at the Peak of Teneriffe, as 1 : 22. Of these three volcanic\r\nmountains, Vesuvius has, therefore, comparatively, the highest cone of\r\ncinders; probably because, being a volcano of inconsiderable height, it\r\nhas chiefly acted through its summit.\r\n\r\nA few months ago, in the year 1822, I succeeded not only in repeating my\r\nearlier barometric measurements of Mount Vesuvius, but also in\r\ndetermining more completely all the margins of the crater[108] during\r\nthree ascents of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThese determinations are, perhaps, deserving of some degree of\r\nattention, since they embrace the long period of the great eruptions\r\nbetween 1805 and 1822, and are probably the only measurements hitherto\r\npublished of any volcano which admit of comparison in all their parts.\r\nThey prove, that the margins of the crater should be regarded as a much\r\nmore permanent phenomenon than has hitherto been supposed, from the\r\nhasty observations made on the subject; and that this character\r\nappertains to them everywhere, and not merely in those instances where,\r\nas at the Peak of Teneriffe, and in all the volcanos of the Andes, they\r\nevidently consist of trachyte. According to my latest determinations it\r\nwould seem, that since the time of Saussure, a period of forty-nine\r\nyears, the north-western margin of Vesuvius has probably not changed at\r\nall, and that the south-eastern one, in the direction of Bosche Tre\r\nCase, which in 1794 had become 426 feet lower, has since then only\r\naltered about 64 feet.\r\n\r\nIf, in the newspaper reports of great eruptions, we often find\r\nassertions made of an entire change of form in Mount Vesuvius, and if\r\nthese assertions appear to be confirmed by the picturesque views of the\r\nvolcano made at Naples, the cause of the error arises from the outlines\r\nof the margins of the crater having been confounded with those of the\r\ncones of eruption accidentally formed in its centre, the bottom of which\r\nhas been raised by the force of vapours. A cone of eruption of this\r\nkind, formed by the accumulation of masses of rapilli and scoriæ,\r\ngradually came to view, above the south-eastern margin of the crater,\r\nbetween the years 1816 and 1818. The eruption in the month of February,\r\n1822, increased this cone to such an elevation, that it projected from\r\n107 to 117 feet above the north-western margin of the crater (the Rocca\r\ndel Palo). This remarkable cone, which was at length regarded at Naples\r\nas the actual summit of Vesuvius, fell in with a fearful crash at the\r\nlast eruption, on the night of the 22nd of October; in consequence of\r\nwhich, the bottom of the crater, which had continued uninterruptedly\r\naccessible from the year 1811, is now nearly 800 feet below the northern\r\nand 213 feet below the southern margin of the volcano. The varying form\r\nand relative position of the cones of eruption, the apertures of which\r\nmust not, as they sometimes are, be confounded with the crater of the\r\nvolcano, give to Vesuvius at different epochs a peculiar physiognomy; so\r\nmuch so, that the historiographer of this volcano, by a mere inspection\r\nof Hackert’s landscapes in the Palace of Portici, might guess the exact\r\nyear in which the artist had made his sketch, by the outline of the\r\nsummit of the mountain, according as the northern or southern side is\r\nrepresented in respect to height.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours after the fall of the cone of scoriæ, which was 426\r\nfeet high, and when the small but numerous streams of lava had flowed\r\noff, on the night between the 23rd and 24th of October, there began a\r\nfiery eruption of ashes and rapilli, which continued uninterruptedly for\r\ntwelve days, but was most violent during the first four days. During\r\nthis period the explosions in the interior of the volcano were so loud\r\nthat the mere vibrations of the air caused the ceilings to crack in the\r\nPalace of Portici, although no shocks of an earthquake were then or had\r\npreviously been experienced. A remarkable phenomenon was observed in the\r\nneighbouring villages of Resina, Torre del Greco, Torre del’ Annunziata,\r\nand Bosche Tre Case. Here the atmosphere was so completely saturated\r\nwith ashes that the whole region was enveloped in complete darkness\r\nduring many hours in the middle of the day. The inhabitants were obliged\r\nto carry lanterns with them through the streets, as is often done in\r\nQuito during the eruptions of Pichincha. Never had the flight of the\r\ninhabitants been more general, for lava streams are less dreaded even\r\nthan an eruption of ashes, a phenomenon unknown here in any degree of\r\nintensity, and one which fills the imaginations of men with images of\r\nterror from the vague tradition of the manner in which Herculaneum,\r\nPompeii, and Stabiæ were destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe hot aqueous vapour which issued from the crater during the eruption,\r\nand diffused itself through the atmosphere, formed, on cooling, a dense\r\ncloud, which enveloped the column of ashes and fire, that rose to an\r\nelevation of between 9000 and 10,000 feet above the level of the sea. So\r\nsudden a condensation of vapour, and, as Gay Lussac has shown, the\r\nformation of the cloud itself, tended to increase electric tension.\r\nFlashes of forked lightning darted in all directions from the column of\r\nashes, while the rolling thunder might be clearly distinguished from the\r\ndeep rumbling sounds within the volcano. In no other eruption had the\r\nplay of the electric forces been so powerfully manifested as on this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 26th of October the strange report was circulated\r\nthat a stream of boiling water was gushing from the crater, and pouring\r\ndown the cone of cinders. Monticelli, the zealous and learned observer\r\nof the volcano, soon perceived that this erroneous report originated in\r\nan optical illusion, and that the supposed stream of water was a great\r\nquantity of dry ashes which issued like drift sand from a crevice in the\r\nhighest margin of the crater. The long drought, which had parched and\r\ndesolated the fields before this eruption of Vesuvius, was succeeded,\r\ntowards the termination of the phenomenon, by a continued and violent\r\nrain, occasioned by the _volcanic storm_ which we have just described. A\r\nsimilar phenomenon characterizes the termination of an eruption in all\r\nzones of the earth. As the cone of cinders is usually wrapped in clouds\r\nat this period, and as the rain is poured forth with most violence near\r\nthis portion of the volcano, streams of mud are generally observed to\r\ndescend from the sides in all directions. The terrified peasant looks\r\nupon them as streams of water that rise from the interior of the volcano\r\nand overflow the crater, while the deceived geologist believes that he\r\ncan recognise in them either sea-water or muddy products of the volcano,\r\nthe so-called _eruptions boueuses_, or, in the language of the old\r\nFrench systematisers, products of an igneo-aqueous liquefaction.\r\n\r\nWhere, as is generally the case in the chain of the Andes, the summit of\r\nthe volcano penetrates beyond the snow-line, attaining sometimes an\r\nelevation twice as great as that of Mount Etna, the inundations we have\r\ndescribed are rendered very frequent and destructive, owing to the\r\nmelting and permeating snow.\r\n\r\nThese are phenomena which have a meteorological connection with the\r\neruptions of volcanos, and are variously modified by the heights of the\r\nmountains, the circumference of the summits which are perpetually\r\ncovered with snow, and the degree to which the walls of cinder cones\r\nbecome heated; but they cannot be regarded in the light of true volcanic\r\nphenomena. Subterranean lakes, communicating by various channels with\r\nthe mountain streams, are frequently formed in deep and vast cavities,\r\neither on the declivity or at the base of volcanos. When the whole mass\r\nof the volcano is powerfully shaken by those earthquakes which precede\r\nall eruptions of fire in the Andes, the subterranean vaults open, and\r\npour forth streams of water, fishes, and tuffaceous mud. This singular\r\nphenomenon brings to mind the _Pimelodes Cyclopum_, or the Silures of\r\nthe Cyclops, which the inhabitants of the plateau of Quito call\r\nPreñadilla, and of which I gave a circumstantial account soon after my\r\nreturn to Europe. When, on the night between the 19th and 20th of June,\r\n1698, the summit of Mount Carguairazo, situated to the north of\r\nChimborazo, and having an elevation of more than 19,000 feet, fell in,\r\nall the country for nearly 32 square miles was covered with mud and\r\nfishes. A similar eruption of fish from the volcano of Imbaburu was\r\nsupposed to have caused the putrid fever, which, seven years before this\r\nperiod, raged in the town of Ibarra.\r\n\r\nI refer to these facts because they throw some light on the difference\r\nbetween the eruption of dry ashes and mud-like inundations of tuff and\r\ntrass, investing fragments of wood, charcoal, and shells. The quantity\r\nof ashes recently erupted from Mount Vesuvius, like every phenomenon\r\nconnected with volcanos and other great and fearful natural phenomena,\r\nhas been greatly exaggerated in the public papers; and two Neapolitan\r\nchemists, Vicenzo Pepe and Guiseppe di Nobili, even asserted that the\r\ncinders were mixed with given proportions of gold and silver,\r\nnotwithstanding the counter-statements of Monticelli and Covelli.\r\nAccording to my researches the stratum of ashes which fell during the\r\ntwelve days was only three feet in thickness in the direction of Bosche\r\nTre Case, on the declivity of the cone, where they were mixed with\r\nrapilli, while in the plains its greatest thickness did not exceed from\r\n16 to 19 inches. Measurements of this kind must not be made at spots\r\nwhere the ashes have been drifted by the wind, like snow or sand, or\r\nwhere they have been accumulated in pulp-like heaps by means of water.\r\nThe times are passed in which, after the manner of the ancients, nothing\r\nwas regarded in volcanic phenomena save the marvellous, and when men\r\nwould believe, like Ctesias, that the ashes from Etna were borne as far\r\nas the Indian peninsula. A portion of the Mexican gold and silver veins\r\nis certainly found in trachytic porphyry, but in the ashes of Vesuvius\r\nwhich I myself collected, and which were, at my request, examined by\r\nthat distinguished chemist Heinrich Rose, no trace of either gold or\r\nsilver was to be discovered.\r\n\r\nHowever much these results, which perfectly correspond with the more\r\nexact observations of Monticelli, may differ from those recently\r\nannounced, it cannot be denied that the eruption of ashes, which\r\ncontinued from the 24th to the 28th of October, is the most memorable\r\nthat has been recorded, on unquestionable evidence, in reference to\r\nMount Vesuvius, since the death of the elder Pliny. The quantity of\r\nashes erupted on this occasion was probably three times as great as the\r\nwhole quantity which has fallen since volcanic phenomena have been\r\nobserved with attention in Italy. A stratum from 16 to 19 inches in\r\nthickness does certainly, at first sight, seem very inconsiderable, when\r\ncompared with the mass with which we find Pompeii covered. But, without\r\ntaking into account the heavy rains and the inundations which must have\r\nincreased the bulk of this stratum in the course of ages, and without\r\nreviving the animated contention maintained with much scepticism on the\r\nother side of the Alps, regarding the causes of the destruction of the\r\nCampanian cities, it may, at any rate, be here observed that the\r\neruptions of a volcano, at widely remote epochs, cannot be compared with\r\nrespect to their intensity. All conclusions must be insufficient that\r\nare based on mere analogies of quantitative relations of the lava and\r\nashes, the height of the column of smoke, and the intensity of the\r\nexplosions.\r\n\r\nWe learn from the geographical description of Strabo, and from the\r\nopinion expressed by Vitruvius on the volcanic origin of pumice, that,\r\nuntil the year of Vespasian’s death, that is to say, until the eruption\r\nwhich buried Pompeii, Vesuvius appeared more like an extinct volcano\r\nthan a Solfatara. When, after a long-continued repose, subterranean\r\nforces suddenly opened for themselves new channels, penetrating through\r\nstrata of primitive rock and trachyte, effects must have been produced\r\nto which no analogy is afforded by those of subsequent occurrence. We\r\nclearly learn from the well-known letter in which Pliny the younger\r\ninforms Tacitus of the death of his uncle, that the renewal of the\r\neruptions, or, one might almost say, the revival of the slumbering\r\nvolcano, began with an outbreak of ashes. The same phenomenon was\r\nobserved at Xorullo, when the new volcano, in the month of September,\r\n1759, breaking through strata of syenite and trachyte, was suddenly\r\nupheaved in the plain. The country people fled in terror on finding\r\ntheir cottages covered with ashes thrown up from the earth, which was\r\nbursting in every direction. In the ordinary periodical manifestations\r\nof volcanic activity a shower of ashes usually terminates each partial\r\neruption. The letter of the younger Pliny contains, moreover, a passage\r\nwhich clearly shows that the dry ashes falling from the air immediately\r\nattained a height of four or five feet, independent of accumulation by\r\ndrifts. “The court,” the narrative continues, “which led to the\r\napartment in which Pliny took his siesta, was so filled with ashes and\r\npumice that, had the sleeper tarried longer, he would have found the\r\npassage wholly blocked up.” Within the inclosed limits of a court the\r\nwind cannot have exercised any very considerable influence on the\r\ndrifting of the ashes.\r\n\r\nI have interrupted my comparative view of volcanos by different\r\nobservations in relation to Vesuvius, partly on account of the great\r\ninterest excited by its recent eruption, and partly because every great\r\noutpouring of ashes almost involuntarily recalls to mind the classic\r\nsoil of Pompeii and Herculaneum. In a note, not adapted to be read to\r\nthe audience to whom this lecture is addressed, I have collected all the\r\nelements of the barometric measurements which I made during the close of\r\nlast year at Mount Vesuvius, and in the Campi Phlegræi.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto considered the form and effects of those volcanos which\r\nare permanently connected, by means of a crater, with the interior of\r\nthe earth. The summits of such volcanos are upheaved masses of trachyte\r\nand lava intersected by numerous veins. The permanency of their effects\r\nindicates a highly complex structure. They have, so to say, a certain\r\nindividuality of character, which remains unaltered for long periods of\r\ntime. Contiguous mountains generally yield wholly different products;\r\nfor instance: leucitic and feldspathic lavas, obsidian with pumice, and\r\nbasaltic masses containing olivine. They belong to the more recent\r\nphenomena of the earth, usually breaking through all the strata of the\r\nfloetz formation, and their lava currents and products are of subsequent\r\norigin to our valleys. Their life, if I may be permitted to use a\r\nfigurative expression, depends upon the mode and the duration of their\r\nconnection with the interior of the earth. After continuing for\r\ncenturies in a state of repose, their activity is often suddenly\r\nrevived, and they then become converted into Solfataras, emitting\r\naqueous vapours, gases, and acids. Occasionally, as at the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe, their summits have already become a laboratory of regenerated\r\nsulphur, while considerable lava currents, being basaltic near the base,\r\nand mixed with obsidian and pumice at greater elevations, where the\r\npressure is less, continue to flow from the sides of the mountain[109].\r\n\r\nBesides volcanos which have permanent craters, there is another kind of\r\nvolcanic phenomena less frequently observed than the former, but\r\nespecially instructive to the geologist, as they remind us of the\r\nprimitive world, that is, of the earliest revolutions of our planet.\r\nTrachytic mountains suddenly open, and after throwing up ashes and lava,\r\nclose again never perhaps to re-open. Such has been the case with the\r\nmighty volcano of Antisana in the chain of the Andes, and with Mount\r\nEpomæus in Ischia, in the year 1302. Occasionally such an eruption has\r\noccurred even in the plains, as on the table-land of Quito, in Iceland\r\nat a distance from Hecla, and in the Lelantine plains of Eubœa. Many\r\nupheaved islands belong to this class of transitory phenomena. In these\r\ncases, the connection with the interior of the earth is not permanent,\r\nthe action ceasing as soon as the fissure, or channel of communication,\r\nis again closed. Veins of basalt, dolerite, and porphyry, which traverse\r\nalmost all formations in different parts of the earth; and the masses of\r\nsyenite, augitic porphyry, and amygdaloid, which characterise the most\r\nrecent strata of transition rock, and the oldest stratum of the floetz\r\nformation; have all probably been formed in a similar manner. In the\r\nyouthful period of our planet, the substances that had continued in a\r\nfluid condition within the earth, broke through its crust, everywhere\r\nintersected with fissures, and became solidified as granular veins, or\r\nwere spread out in broad superimposed strata. The products that may be\r\ntermed exclusively volcanic, which have come down to us from the\r\nprimitive ages of the world, have not flowed in streams or bands like\r\nthe lava of our isolated conical mountains. The mixtures of augite,\r\ntitanic iron, feldspar, and hornblende, may have been the same at\r\ndifferent periods, sometimes allied to basalt, sometimes to trachyte;\r\nwhile chemical substances, (as we learn from Mitscherlich’s important\r\nlabours and the analogies presented by artificial igneous products,) may\r\nhave ranged themselves in layers according to some definite laws of\r\ncrystallization. In all cases we perceive that substances similarly\r\ncomposed have come to the surface of the earth by very different means,\r\neither by being simply upheaved, or escaping through temporary fissures;\r\nand that breaking through the older rocks, that is to say, through the\r\nearlier oxidized earth’s crust, they have flowed in the form of lava\r\nstreams from conical mountains having a permanent crater. If we do not\r\nsufficiently distinguish between these various phenomena, our knowledge\r\nof the geology of volcanos will again be shrouded in that obscurity,\r\nfrom which numerous comparative experiments are now beginning gradually\r\nto release it.\r\n\r\nThe questions have often been asked, what is it that burns in volcanos,\r\nwhat generates the degree of heat capable of mixing earths and metals\r\ntogether in a state of fusion? Modern chemistry has attempted to reply\r\nthat it is the earths, metals, and alkalies themselves, that is to say,\r\nthe metalloids of these substances, which burn. The solid and already\r\noxidized crust of the earth separates the surrounding atmosphere, with\r\nthe oxygen it contains, from the combustible unoxidized substances in\r\nthe interior of our planet. By the contact of these metalloids with the\r\natmospheric oxygen the disengagement of caloric ensues. The celebrated\r\nand talented chemist, who advanced this explanation of volcanic\r\nphenomena, soon himself relinquished it. The experiments which have been\r\nmade in mines and caverns in all parts of the earth, and which M. Arago\r\nand myself have collected in a separate treatise, prove that even at an\r\ninconsiderable depth, the temperature of the earth is much higher than\r\nthe mean temperature of the atmosphere at the same place. This\r\nremarkable, and almost universally confirmed fact, is connected with\r\nwhat we learn from volcanic phenomena. The depth at which we might\r\nregard the earth as a fused mass, has been calculated. The primitive\r\ncause of this subterranean heat is, as in all planets, the formative\r\nprocess itself, the separation of the spherically conglomerating mass\r\nfrom a cosmical aëriform fluid, and the cooling of the terrestrial\r\nstrata at different depths by the radiation of heat. All volcanic\r\nphenomena are probably the result of a permanent or transient connection\r\nbetween the interior and the exterior of our planet. Elastic vapours\r\npress the fused oxidizing substances upwards through deep fissures.\r\nVolcanos therefore are intermittent earth-springs, from which the fluid\r\nmixtures of metals, alkalies, and earths, which become consolidated into\r\nlava currents, flow gently and calmly, when being upheaved they find a\r\nvent. In a similar manner, according to Plato’s Phædon, the ancients\r\nregarded all volcanic streams of fire as effusions of the\r\nPyriphlegethon.\r\n\r\nI would fain be permitted to add one yet bolder observation to those I\r\nhave already ventured to advance. May not the cause of one of the most\r\nwonderful phenomena presented by the study of petrifactions, be\r\ndependent on the condition of the inner heat of our planet, which is\r\nindicated by thermometric experiments on springs[110] rising from\r\ndifferent depths, and by observations on volcanos? We find tropical\r\nanimals, arborescent ferns, palms, and bamboos, buried in the cold\r\nnorth, and everywhere the primitive world presents a distribution of\r\norganic structures wholly at variance with existing climatic relations.\r\nMany hypotheses have been advanced in elucidation of so important a\r\nproblem, such as the approximation of a comet, the altered obliquity of\r\nthe ecliptic, and the increased intensity of the sun’s light; but none\r\nof these have satisfied at once the astronomer, the physicist, and the\r\ngeologist. I, for my part, would willingly leave undisturbed the axis of\r\nthe earth or the light of the sun’s disk, (from whose spots a celebrated\r\nastronomer explained fruitfulness and failure of crops,) yet it appears\r\nto me that in every planet there exist, independently of its relations\r\nto a central body and its astronomical position, numerous causes for the\r\ndevelopment of heat, in processes of oxidation, in precipitation, in the\r\nchemically altered capacity of bodies, the increase of electro-magnetic\r\ntension, and in the channels of communication opened between its\r\ninternal and external parts.\r\n\r\nWherever, in the primitive world, heat was radiated from the deeply\r\nfissured crust of the earth, palms, arborescent ferns, and all the\r\nanimals of the torrid zone, could perhaps have flourished for centuries\r\nover extensive tracts of land. According to this view, which I have\r\nalready published in my work entitled _Geognostischer Versuch über die\r\nLagerung der Gebirgsarten in beiden Hemisphären_,[RG] the temperature of\r\nvolcanos would be that of the interior of our earth itself, and the same\r\ncauses which now occasion such fearfully devastating results, may have\r\nbeen able to produce, in every zone, the most luxuriant vegetation on\r\nthe newly oxidized crust of the earth and on the deeply fissured strata\r\nof rocks.\r\n\r\nShould it be assumed, for the purpose of explaining the wonderful\r\ndistribution of tropical forms in their ancient mausolea, that the\r\nlong-haired elephantine animals, which are now found embedded in ice,\r\nwere once indigenous to northern latitudes, and that animals of similar\r\nforms, belonging to the same type, as, for instance, lions and lynxes,\r\nwere capable of living in wholly different climates, such a mode of\r\nexplanation would at all events not admit of being extended to vegetable\r\nproducts. From causes developed by the physiology of vegetation, palms,\r\nbananas, and arborescent monocotyledons, are unable to endure the\r\ndeprivation of their appendicular organs, by the northern cold; and in\r\nthe geological problem which we are here considering, it seems to me a\r\nmatter of difficulty to admit any distinction between vegetable and\r\nanimal structures. One and the same mode of explanation must be applied\r\nto both forms.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this treatise, I have added some uncertain and\r\nhypothetical conjectures to the facts which have been collected in\r\nwidely remote regions of the earth. The philosophical study of nature\r\nrises above the requirements of mere delineation, and does not consist\r\nin the sterile accumulation of isolated facts. The active and inquiring\r\nspirit of man may therefore be occasionally permitted to escape from the\r\npresent into the domain of the past, to conjecture that which cannot yet\r\nbe clearly determined, and thus to revel amid the ancient and\r\never-recurring myths of geology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         EXPLANATORY ADDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  P. 363.—“_A more complete determination of the margins of the Crater\r\n  of Mount Vesuvius._”\r\n\r\n  My astronomical fellow-labourer, Oltmanns, who was unhappily too early\r\n  lost to science, has re-calculated the barometric measurements I made\r\n  on Mount Vesuvius (from the 22nd to the 25th of November, and on the\r\n  1st of December, 1822), and compared the results with those yielded by\r\n  the measurements given to me in manuscript by Lord Minto, Visconti,\r\n  Monticelli, Brioschi, and Poulett Scrope.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A. _Rocca del Palo, the highest northern margin of the Crater of\r\n                      Vesuvius, was estimated by_—\r\n                                                                   Feet.\r\n Saussure, in 1773, barometrically, probably according to Deluc’s\r\n   formula                                                          3894\r\n Poli (1794), barometrically                                        3875\r\n Breislak (1794), barometrically, although, as in the case of\r\n   Poli, it is uncertain what formula was used                      3920\r\n Gay-Lussac, Leopold von Buch, and Humboldt (1805),\r\n   barometrically, according to the formula of Laplace, as in all\r\n   the following barometric results                                 3856\r\n Brioschi (1810), trigonometrically                                 4079\r\n Visconti (1816), trigonometrically                                 3977\r\n Lord Minto (1822), barometrically, and frequently repeated         3971\r\n Poulett Scrope (1822).

Differences of\r\n  elevations are moreover always preferable to absolute elevations.\r\n  These differences show, that since 1794, the relative condition of the\r\n  margins of the Rocca del Palo and of that towards Bosche Tre Case had\r\n  remained almost the same. I found, in 1805, for the height, 441, and\r\n  in 1822, nearly 524 feet. A distinguished geologist, Mr. Poulett\r\n  Scrope, obtained 473 feet, although his absolute heights for these two\r\n  margins of the crater appear somewhat too low. So inconsiderable a\r\n  variation in a period of twenty-eight years, and during violent\r\n  disturbances in the interior of the mountain, is undoubtedly a\r\n  remarkable phenomenon.\r\n\r\n  The height to which the cones of scoriæ rise from the bottom of the\r\n  crater at Vesuvius also deserves special attention. Shuckburgh found\r\n  in 1776 a cone of this nature to be 3932 feet above the level of the\r\n  Mediterranean; and, according to Lord Minto—a remarkably exact\r\n  observer—the cone of scoriæ which fell in on the 22nd of October,\r\n  1822, was even 4156 feet high. On both occasions therefore the cone of\r\n  scoriæ in the crater exceeded the highest point of the margin of the\r\n  crater. On comparing the measurements of Rocca del Palo from 1773 to\r\n  1822, one is almost involuntarily led to hazard the bold conjecture\r\n  that the northern margin of the crater has been gradually upheaved by\r\n  subterranean forces. The correspondence of the three measurements made\r\n  between 1773 and 1805 is almost as striking as in those between 1816\r\n  and 1822. No doubt can be entertained as to the height being from 3970\r\n  to 4021 feet during the latter period. Ought less confidence to be\r\n  attached to the measurements made thirty or forty years previously,\r\n  and which only gave from 3875 to 3894 feet? After a longer lapse of\r\n  time the question may be decided, as to how much is attributable to\r\n  errors of measurement, and how much to the upheaval of the margin of\r\n  the crater. There is here no accumulation of loose masses from above;\r\n  if therefore the solid trachytic lava strata of the Rocca del Palo\r\n  actually rise, we must assume that they are upheaved from below by\r\n  volcanic forces.\r\n\r\n  My learned and indefatigable friend, Oltmanns, has published the\r\n  details of all these measurements with critical remarks.[RH] Would\r\n  that this work might incite geognosists to enter upon a series of\r\n  hypsometric observations, by which, in the course of time, Vesuvius,\r\n  which is, excepting Stromboli, the most accessible of all European\r\n  volcanos, may be thoroughly understood in all periods of its\r\n  development.\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  p. 371—“_At elevations where the pressure is less_.”\r\n\r\n  Compare Leopold von Buch on the Peak of Teneriffe, in his\r\n  _Physikalische Beschreibung der canarischen Inseln_, 1825, s. 213, and\r\n  in the _Abhandlungen der königl. Akademie zu Berlin, aus den J.\r\n  1820–21_, s. 99.\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  p. 373—“_Springs which rise from different depths_.”\r\n\r\n  Compare Arago in the _Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes pour 1835_, p.\r\n  234. The increase of the temperature is in our latitudes 1° Fahr. for\r\n  nearly every 54 feet. In the Artesian boring at the New Salt-works\r\n  (Oeynhausen’s Bath) near Minden, which is the greatest known depth\r\n  that has been reached below the surface of the sea, the temperature of\r\n  the water at 2231 feet, is fully 91° Fahrenheit, whilst the mean upper\r\n  temperature of the air may be assumed at 49°·3 Fahr. It is very\r\n  remarkable that, even in the third century, Saint Patricius, bishop of\r\n  Pertusa, should have been led, from the thermal springs near Carthage,\r\n  to form a very correct view of such an increase of heat.[RI]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  VITAL FORCE, OR THE RHODIAN GENIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Syracusans, like the Athenians, had their Poecile,[RJ] where\r\nrepresentations of gods and heroes, the works of Grecian and Italian\r\nart, adorned the richly decorated halls of the Portico. Incessantly the\r\npeople streamed thither; the young warrior to feast his eyes upon the\r\ndeeds of his forefathers, the artist to contemplate the works of the\r\ngreat masters. Among the numerous paintings which the active enterprise\r\nof the Syracusans had collected from the mother country, there was but\r\none which for full a century had continued to attract the attention of\r\nevery visitor. Even when, the Olympian Jupiter, Cecrops, the founder of\r\ncities, and the heroic courage of Harmodius and Aristogiton, failed to\r\nattract admirers, a dense crowd still pressed round this one picture.\r\nWhence this preference? Was the painting a rescued work of Apelles, or\r\ndid it bear the impress of the school of Callimachus? No! although it\r\npossessed both grace and beauty, yet neither in the blending of the\r\ncolours, nor in the character and style of its composition, could it be\r\ncompared with many other paintings in the Poecile.\r\n\r\nThe crowd—and how numerous are the classes included in this\r\ndenomination—ever admires and wonders at what it does not understand!\r\nFor more than a century had that painting been publicly exhibited, and\r\nyet, although Syracuse contained within its narrow limits more artistic\r\ngenius than all the rest of sea-girt Sicily, the riddle of its meaning\r\nstill remained unsolved. It was not even known to what temple it had\r\nformerly belonged, for it had been saved from a stranded vessel, which\r\nwas only conjectured, from the freight it carried, to have come from\r\nRhodes.\r\n\r\nThe foreground of the picture was occupied by a numerous group of youths\r\nand maidens, whose uncovered limbs, although well formed, were not cast\r\nin that slender mould which we so much admire in the statues of\r\nPraxiteles and Alcamenes. The fuller development of their limbs, which\r\nbore indications of laborious exercise,—the human expression of passion\r\nand of care stamped on their features,—all seemed to divest them of a\r\nheavenly or God-like type, and to fix them as creatures of the earth.\r\nTheir hair was simply adorned with leaves and wild flowers. Their arms\r\nwere extended towards each other with impassioned longing, but their\r\nearnest and mournful gaze was rivetted on a Genius, who, surrounded by a\r\nbrilliant halo, hovered in the midst of the group. On his shoulder was a\r\nbutterfly, and in his right hand he held aloft a flaming torch. His\r\nlimbs were moulded with child-like grace; his eye radiant with celestial\r\nlight. He looked imperiously upon the youths and maidens at his feet. No\r\nother characteristic traits could be distinguished in the picture. Some,\r\nhowever, thought they could perceive at his foot the letters ζ and σ,\r\nand as antiquarians were then no less bold than they are now, they\r\ninferred, though far from happily, that the artist was called Zenodorus,\r\nthe name borne at a later date by the modeller of the Colossus of\r\nRhodes.\r\n\r\n“The Rhodian Genius,” for so this mysterious painting was called, did\r\nnot however want for interpreters in Syracuse. Virtuosi, especially the\r\nyounger of them, on their return from a flying visit to Corinth or\r\nAthens, would have deemed themselves deficient in all pretensions to\r\nconnoisseurship, had they not immediately advanced some new explanation.\r\nSome regarded the Genius as the personification of spiritual Love,\r\nforbidding the enjoyment of sensual pleasures; others were of opinion\r\nthat the dominion of Reason over the Passions was here signified. The\r\nwiser preserved silence, and while they conjectured that the painting\r\nwas intended to represent something of a sublimer character, delighted\r\nto linger in the Poecile to admire the simple composition of the group.\r\n\r\nThe question continued to remain undecided. Copies of the painting, with\r\nvarious additions, were sent to Greece, but without eliciting any\r\nexplanation respecting its origin. At length, however, when at the early\r\nrising of the Pleiades the Ægean Sea was again opened to navigation,\r\nships from Rhodes entered the port of Syracuse. They contained a\r\ntreasure of statues, altars, candelabras, and pictures, which a love of\r\nart had caused the Dionysii to collect in Greece. Among the paintings\r\nthere was one which was instantly recognised as the companion to the\r\n“Rhodian Genius.” It was of the same size, and exhibited a similar tone\r\nof colouring, although in a better state of preservation.\r\n\r\nThe Genius stood as before in the centre, but without the butterfly; his\r\nhead was drooping, his torch extinguished and reversed. The group of\r\nyouths and maidens thronged simultaneously around him in mutual embrace;\r\ntheir looks were no longer sad and submissive, but announced a wild\r\nemancipation from restraint, and the gratification of long-nourished\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nThe Syracusan antiquaries had already begun to accommodate their former\r\nexplanations of the “Rhodian Genius” to the newly arrived painting, when\r\nthe Tyrant ordered it to be conveyed to the house of Epicharmus. This\r\nphilosopher of the school of Pythagoras dwelt in the remote part of\r\nSyracuse called Tyche. He seldom visited the court of the Dionysii, not\r\nbut that learned men from all the Greek colonies assembled there, but\r\nbecause proximity to princes is apt to rob the most intellectual of\r\ntheir spirit and freedom. He occupied himself unceasingly in studying\r\nthe nature of things and their forces, the origin of plants and animals,\r\nand those harmonious laws by which the celestial bodies on a large, and\r\nthe snow-flake and the hail-stone on a small scale, assume a globular\r\nform. Decrepid with age, he caused himself to be carried daily to the\r\nPoecile, and thence to the harbour of Nasos, where, as he said, the wide\r\nocean presented to his eye an image of the Boundless and the Infinite,\r\nwhich his mind strove in vain to comprehend. He was honoured alike by\r\nthe lower classes and by the tyrant, but he avoided the latter, while he\r\njoyfully cultivated and often assisted the former.\r\n\r\nEpicharmus lay weak and exhausted on his couch, when the newly arrived\r\nwork of art was brought to him by the command of Dionysius. He was\r\nfurnished at the same time with a faithful copy of the “Rhodian Genius,”\r\nand the philosopher now caused both paintings to be placed before him.\r\nHe gazed on them long and earnestly, then called together his scholars,\r\nand in accents of emotion thus addressed them:\r\n\r\n“Remove the curtain from the window, that I may once more feed my eyes\r\nwith the sight of the richly animated and living earth. Sixty years long\r\nhave I pondered on the internal springs of nature and on the differences\r\ninherent in matter, but it is only this day that the ‘Rhodian Genius’\r\nhas taught me to see clearly that which before I had only conjectured.\r\nWhile the difference of sexes in all living beings beneficently binds\r\nthem together in prolific union, the crude matters of inorganic nature\r\nare impelled by like instincts. Even in the darkness of chaos, matter\r\nwas accumulated or separated according as affinity or antagonism\r\nattracted or repelled its various parts. The celestial fire follows the\r\nmetals, the magnet, the iron; amber when rubbed attaches light bodies;\r\nearth blends with earth; salt separates from the waters of the sea and\r\njoins its like, while the acid moisture of the _stypteria_ (στυπτηρία\r\nὑγρά) and the fleecy salt _Trichitis_, love the clay of Melos.\r\nEverything in inanimate nature hastens to associate itself with its\r\nlike. No earthly element (and who will dare to class light as such?) can\r\ntherefore be found in a pure and virgin state. Everything as soon as\r\nformed hastens to enter into new combinations, and nought, save the\r\ndisjoining art of man, can present in a separate state ingredients which\r\nye would vainly seek in the interior of the earth, or in the moving\r\noceans of air and water. In dead inorganic matter absolute repose\r\nprevails as long as the bonds of affinity remain unsevered, and as long\r\nas no third substance intrudes to blend itself with the others; but even\r\nafter this disturbance unfruitful repose soon again succeeds.\r\n\r\n“Different, however, is the blending of the same substances in animal\r\nand vegetable bodies. Here vital force imperatively asserts its rights,\r\nand, heedless of the affinity and antagonism of the atoms asserted by\r\nDemocritus, unites substances which in inanimate nature ever flee from\r\neach other, and separates that which is incessantly striving to unite.\r\n\r\n“Draw nearer to me, my disciples, and recognise in the ‘Rhodian Genius,’\r\nin the expression of his youthful vigour, in the butterfly on his\r\nshoulder, in the commanding glance of his eye, the symbol of _vital\r\nforce_ as it animates every germ of organic creation. The earthly\r\nelements at his feet are striving to gratify their own desires and to\r\nmingle with one another. Imperiously the Genius threatens them with\r\nupraised and high-flaming torch, and compels them, regardless of their\r\nancient rights, to obey his laws.\r\n\r\n“Look now on the new work of art which the Tyrant has sent me to\r\nexplain; and turn your eyes from the picture of life to the picture of\r\ndeath. The butterfly has soared upwards, the extinguished torch is\r\nreversed, and the head of the youth is drooping. The spirit has fled to\r\nother spheres, and the vital force is extinct. Now the youths and\r\nmaidens join their hands in joyous accord. Earthly matter again resumes\r\nits rights. Released from all bonds they impetuously follow their sexual\r\ninstincts, and the day of his death is to them a day of nuptials.—Thus\r\ndead matter, animated by vital force, passes through a countless series\r\nof races, and perchance enshrines in the very substance in which of old\r\na miserable worm enjoyed its brief existence, the divine spirit of\r\nPythagoras.[RK]\r\n\r\n“Go, Polycles, and tell the Tyrant what thou hast heard! And ye, my\r\nbeloved, Euryphamos, Lysis, and Scopas, come nearer—and yet nearer to\r\nme! I feel that the faint vital force within me can no longer retain in\r\nsubjection the earthly matter, which now reclaims its freedom. Lead me\r\nonce more to the Poecile, and thence to the wide sea-shore. Soon will ye\r\ncollect my ashes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ILLUSTRATION AND NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Preface to the Second and Third Editions of this work (See\r\npreliminary pages of this translation) I have already noticed the\r\nrepublication of the preceding tale, which was first printed in\r\nSchiller’s _Horen_ (for the year 1795, part 5, pages 90–96). It embodies\r\nthe development of a physiological idea in a semi-mythical garb. In the\r\nyear 1793, in the Latin _Aphorisms from the Chemical Physiology of\r\nPlants_, appended to my _Subterranean Flora_, I had defined the _vital\r\nforce_ as the unknown cause which prevents the elements from following\r\ntheir original attractive forces. The first of my aphorisms ran thus:—\r\n\r\n“Rerum naturam si totam consideres, magnum atque durabile, quod inter\r\nelementa intercedit, discrimen perspicies, quorum altera affinitatum\r\nlegibus obtemperantia, altera, vinculis solutis, varie juncta apparent.\r\nQuod quidem discrimen in elementis ipsis eorumque indole neutiquam\r\npositum, quum ex sola distributione singulorum petendum esse videatur.\r\nMateriam segnem, brutam, inanimam eam vocamus, cujus stamina secundum\r\nleges chymicæ affinitatis mixta sunt. Animata atque organica ea\r\npotissimum corpora appellamus, quæ, licet in novas mutari formas\r\nperpetuo tendant, vi interna quadam continentur, quominus priscam\r\nsibique insitam formam relinquant.\r\n\r\n“Vim internam, quæ chymicæ affinitatis vincula resolvit, atque obstat,\r\nquominus elementa corporum libere conjungantur, vitalem vocamus. Itaque\r\nnullum certius mortis criterium putredine datur, qua primæ partes vel\r\nstamina rerum, antiquis juribus revocatis, affinitatum legibus parent.\r\nCorporum inanimorum nulla putredo esse potest.”[RL]\r\n\r\nThese opinions, against which the acute Vicq d’Azyr has protested in his\r\n_Traité d’Anatomie_, vol. i. p. 5, but which are still entertained by\r\nmany eminent persons among my friends, I have placed in the mouth of\r\nEpicharmus. Reflection and prolonged study in the departments of\r\nphysiology and chemistry have deeply shaken my earlier belief in\r\npeculiar, so-called vital forces. In the year 1797, at the conclusion of\r\nmy _Versuche über die gereizte Muskel- und Nervenfaser, nebst\r\nVermuthungen über den chemischen Process des Lebens in der Thier- und\r\nPflanzenwelt_ (vol. ii. pp. 430–436), I already declared that I by no\r\nmeans regarded the existence of these peculiar vital forces as\r\nestablished. Since that period I have not applied the term _peculiar\r\nforces_ to that which may possibly be produced only by the combined\r\naction of the separate already long known substances and their material\r\nforces. We may, however, deduce a more certain definition of _animate_\r\nand _inanimate_ substances from the chemical relations of the elements,\r\nthan can be derived from the criteria of voluntary movement, the\r\ncirculation of fluid in solid parts, and the inner appropriation and\r\nfibrous arrangement of the elements. I call that substance _animate_\r\n“whose voluntarily separated parts change their composition after\r\nseparation has taken place, the former external relations still\r\ncontinuing the same.” This definition is merely the expression of a\r\nfact. The equilibrium of the elements is maintained in animate matter by\r\nvirtue of their being parts of one whole. One organ determines another,\r\none gives to another the temperature, the tone as it were, in which\r\nthese, and no other affinities operate. Thus in organisation all is\r\nreciprocal, means and end. The rapidity with which organic parts change\r\ntheir compound state, when separated from a complex of living organs,\r\ndiffers greatly according to the degree of their dependence, and the\r\nnature of the component materials. The blood of animals, which is\r\nvariously modified in the different classes, undergoes a change earlier\r\nthan the juices of plants. Fungi generally decompose more rapidly than\r\nthe leaves of trees; and muscle more readily than the cutis.\r\n\r\nBone, the elementary structure of which has only been understood of late\r\nyears, the hair of animals, the ligneous part of vegetable substances,\r\nthe shells or husks of fruit, and the feathery calix (_pappus_) of\r\nplants, are not inorganic and devoid of life; but approximate, even in\r\nlife, to the condition which they manifest after their separation from\r\nthe rest of the organism. The higher the degree of vitality or\r\nirritability of an animate substance, the more striking or rapid will be\r\nthe change in its compound state after separation. “The aggregate of the\r\ncells is an organism, and the organism _lives_ as long as its parts\r\ncontinue actively subservient to the whole. Considered antithetically to\r\ninanimate nature, the organism _appears_ to be self-determining.”[RM]\r\nThe difficulty of satisfactorily referring the vital phenomena of\r\norganism to physical and chemical laws, depends chiefly (and almost in\r\nthe same manner as the prediction of meteorological processes in the\r\natmosphere) on the complication of the phenomena, and on the great\r\nnumber of the simultaneously acting forces, as well as the conditions of\r\ntheir activity.\r\n\r\nI have faithfully adhered in the _Cosmos_ to the same mode of\r\nrepresenting and considering the so-called _vital forces_, and\r\naffinities,[RN] the formative impulse and the principle of organising\r\nactivity. I there wrote as follows:[RO] “The mythical ideas long\r\nentertained of the imponderable substances, and vital forces, peculiar\r\nto each mode of organization, have complicated our views generally, and\r\nshed an uncertain light on the path we ought to pursue.\r\n\r\n“The most various forms of intuition have thus, age after age, aided in\r\naugmenting the prodigious mass of empirical knowledge, which in our own\r\nday has been enlarged with ever-increasing rapidity. The investigating\r\nspirit of man strives, from time to time, with varying success, to break\r\nthrough those ancient forms and symbols invented to subject rebellious\r\nmatter to rules of mechanical construction.”\r\n\r\nFurther in the same work,[RP] I have said, “It must, however, be\r\nremembered, that the inorganic crust of the earth contains within it the\r\nsame elements that enter into the structure of animal and vegetable\r\norgans. A physical cosmography would therefore be incomplete, if it were\r\nto omit a consideration of these forces, and of the substances which\r\nenter into solid and fluid combinations in organic tissues, under\r\nconditions which, from our ignorance of their actual nature, we\r\ndesignate by the vague term of _vital forces_, and group into various\r\nsystems, in accordance with more or less perfectly conceived\r\nanalogies.”[RQ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  THE\r\n                        PLATEAU, OR TABLE-LAND,\r\n                                   OF\r\n                               CAXAMARCA,\r\n              THE ANCIENT CAPITAL OF THE INCA ATAHUALLPA,\r\n                                AND THE\r\n                    FIRST VIEW OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN,\r\n                     _From the Ridge of the Andes_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter having sojourned for a whole year on the ridge of the Andes, or\r\nAntis,[111], between 4° north and 4° south latitude, amidst the\r\ntable-lands of New Granada, Pastos, and Quito, and consequently at an\r\nelevation varying between 8,500 and 13,000 feet above the level of the\r\nsea, it is delightful to descend gradually through the more genial\r\nclimate of the Cinchona or Quina Woods of Loxa, into the plains of the\r\nUpper Amazon. There an unknown world unfolds itself, rich in magnificent\r\nvegetation. The little town of Loxa has given its name to the most\r\nefficacious of all fever barks,—the Quina, or the Cascarilla fina de\r\nLoxa. This bark is the precious produce of the tree, which we have\r\nbotanically described as the Cinchona Condaminea; but which, (from the\r\nerroneous supposition that all the Cinchona known in commerce was\r\nobtained from one and the same tree,) had previously been called\r\nCinchona officinalis. The fever bark first became known, in Europe,\r\nabout the middle of the seventeenth century. Sebastian Badus affirms,\r\nthat it was brought to Alcala de Henares in the year 1632; but according\r\nto other accounts, it was brought to Madrid in 1640, when the Countess\r\nde Chinchon[112], the wife of the Peruvian Viceroy, arrived from Lima,\r\n(where she had been cured of an intermittent fever,) accompanied by her\r\nphysician, Juan del Vego. The finest kind of Cinchona is obtained at the\r\ndistance of from eight to twelve miles southward of the town of Loxa,\r\namong the mountains of Uritusinga, Villonaco, and Rumisitana. The trees\r\nwhich yield this bark grow on mica slate and gneiss, at the moderate\r\nelevations of 5755 and 7673 feet above the level of the sea, nearly\r\ncorresponding, respectively, with the heights of the Hospital on the\r\nGrimsel, and the Pass of the Great St. Bernard. The Cinchona Woods in\r\nthese parts are bounded by the little rivulets Zamora and Cachyacu.\r\n\r\nThe tree is felled in its first flowering season, or about the fourth or\r\nseventh year of its growth, according as it may have been reared from a\r\nstrong shoot or from seed. At the time of my journey in Peru we learned,\r\nwith surprise, that the quantity of the Cinchona Condaminea annually\r\nobtained at Loxa by the Cascarilla gatherers, or Quina hunters\r\n(_Cascarilleros_ and _Caçadores de Quina_), amounted only to 110 hundred\r\nweight. At that time none of this valuable product found its way into\r\ncommerce; all that was obtained was shipped at Payta, a port of the\r\nPacific, and conveyed round Cape Horn to Cadiz, for the use of the\r\nSpanish Court. To procure the small supply of 11,000 Spanish pounds, no\r\nless than 800 or 900 Cinchona trees were cut down every year. The older\r\nand thicker stems are becoming more and more scarce; but, such is the\r\nluxuriance of growth, that the younger trees, which now supply the\r\ndemand, though measuring only six inches in diameter, frequently attain\r\nthe height of from 53 to 64 feet. This beautiful tree, which is adorned\r\nwith leaves five inches long and two broad, seems, when growing in the\r\nthick woods, as if striving to rise above its neighbours. The upper\r\nbranches spread out, and when agitated by the wind the leaves have a\r\npeculiar reddish colour and glistening appearance which is\r\ndistinguishable at a great distance. The mean temperature of the woods\r\nof the Cinchona Condaminea varies between 60° and 66° Fahrenheit; that\r\nis to say, about the mean annual temperature of Florence and the Island\r\nof Madeira: but the extremes of heat and cold experienced at those\r\npoints of the temperate zone, are never felt in the vicinity of Loxa.\r\nHowever, comparisons between climates in very different degrees of\r\nlatitude, and the climate of the table-lands of the tropical zone, must,\r\nfrom their very nature, be unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nDescending from the mountain node of Loxa, south-south-east, into the\r\nhot valley of the Amazon River, the traveller passes over the Paramos of\r\nChulucanas, Guamani, and Yamoca. These Paramos are the mountainous\r\ndeserts, which have been mentioned in another portion of the present\r\nwork; and which, in the southern parts of the Andes, are known by the\r\nname of Puna, a word belonging to the Quichua language. In most places,\r\ntheir elevation is about 10,125 feet. They are stormy, frequently\r\nenveloped for several successive days in thick fogs, or visited by\r\nterrific hail-storms; the hail-stones being not only of different forms,\r\ngenerally much flattened by rotation, but also run together into thin\r\nfloating plates of ice called papa-cara, which cut the face and hands in\r\ntheir fall. During this meteoric process, I have sometimes known the\r\nthermometer to sink to 48° and even 43° Fahrenheit, and the electric\r\ntension of the atmosphere, measured by the voltaic electrometer, has\r\nchanged, in the space of a few minutes, from positive to negative. When\r\nthe temperature is below 43° Fahrenheit, snow falls in large flakes,\r\nscattered widely apart; but it disappears after the lapse of a few\r\nhours. The short thin branches of the small leaved myrtle-like shrubs,\r\nthe large size and luxuriance of the blossoms, and the perpetual\r\nfreshness caused by the absorption of the moist atmosphere—all impart a\r\npeculiar aspect and character to the treeless vegetation of the Paramos.\r\nNo zone of Alpine vegetation, whether in temperate or cold climates, can\r\nbe compared with that of the Paramos in the tropical Andes.\r\n\r\nThe solemn impression which is felt on beholding the deserts of the\r\nCordilleras, is increased in a remarkable and unexpected manner, by the\r\ncircumstance that in these very regions there still exist wonderful\r\nremains of the great road of the Incas, that stupendous work by means of\r\nwhich, communication was maintained among all the provinces of the\r\nempire along an extent of upwards of 1000 geographical miles. On the\r\nsides of this road, and nearly at equal distances apart, there are small\r\nhouses, built of well-cut free-stone. These buildings, which answered\r\nthe purpose of stations, or caravanseries, are called Tambos, and also\r\nInca-Pilca, (from Pircca, the Wall). Some are surrounded by a sort of\r\nfortification; others were destined for baths, and had arrangements for\r\nthe conveyance of warm water: the larger ones were intended exclusively\r\nfor the family of the sovereign. At the foot of the volcano Cotopaxi,\r\nnear Callo, I had previously seen buildings of the same kind in a good\r\nstate of preservation. These I accurately measured, and made drawings\r\nfrom them. Pedro de Cieça, who wrote in the sixteenth century, calls\r\nthese structures Aposentos de Mulalo[113]. The pass of the Andes, lying\r\nbetween Alausi and Loxa, called the Paramo del Assuay, a much frequented\r\nroute across the Ladera de Cadlud, is at the elevation of 15,526 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea, and consequently almost at the height of\r\nMont Blanc. As we were proceeding through this pass, we experienced\r\nconsiderable difficulty in guiding our heavily laden mules over the\r\nmarshy ground on the level height of the Pullal; but whilst we journeyed\r\nonward for the distance of about four miles, our eyes were continually\r\nrivetted on the grand remains of the Inca Road, upwards of 20 feet in\r\nbreadth. This road had a deep under-structure, and was paved with\r\nwell-hewn blocks of black trap porphyry. None of the Roman roads which I\r\nhave seen in Italy, in the south of France and in Spain, appeared to me\r\nmore imposing than this work of the ancient Peruvians; and the Inca road\r\nis the more extraordinary, since, according to my barometrical\r\ncalculations, it is situated at an elevation of 13,258 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, a height exceeding that of the summit of the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe by upwards of 1000 feet. At an equal elevation, are the ruins\r\nsaid to be those of the palace of the Inca Tupac Yupanqui, and known by\r\nthe name of the Paredones del Inca, situated on the Assuay. From these\r\nruins the Inca road, running southward in the direction of Cuenca, leads\r\nto the small but well-preserved fortress of the Cañar[114], probably\r\nbelonging to the same period, viz.: the reign of Tupac Yupanqui, or that\r\nof his warlike son Huayna Capac.\r\n\r\nWe saw still grander remains of the ancient Peruvian Inca road, on our\r\nway between Loxa and the Amazon, near the baths of the Incas on the\r\nParamo of Chulucanas, not far from Guancabamba, and also in the vicinity\r\nof Ingatambo, near Pomahuaca. The ruins at the latter place are situated\r\nso low, that I found the difference of level between the Inca road at\r\nPomahuaca, and that in the Paramo del Assuay, to be upwards of 9700\r\nfeet. The distance in a direct line, as determined by astronomical\r\nlatitudes, is precisely 184 miles; and the ascent of the road is about\r\n3730 feet greater than the elevation of the Pass of Mont Cenis, above\r\nthe Lake of Como. There are two great causeways, paved with flat stones,\r\nand in some places covered with cemented gravel[115], on Macadam’s plan.\r\nOne of these lines of road runs through the broad and barren plain lying\r\nbetween the sea-coast and the chain of the Andes, whilst the other\r\npasses along the ridge of the Cordilleras. Stones, marking the distances\r\nat equal intervals, are frequently seen. The rivulets and ravines were\r\ncrossed by bridges of three kinds; some being of stone, some of wood,\r\nand others of rope. These bridges are called by the Peruvians, Puentes\r\nde Hamaca, or Puentes de Maroma. There were also aqueducts for conveying\r\nwater to the Tambos and fortresses. Both lines of road were directed to\r\nCuzco, the central point and capital of the great Peruvian empire,\r\nsituated in 13° 31′ south lat., and according to Pentland’s Map of\r\nBolivia, at the elevation of 11,378 feet above the level of the sea. As\r\nthe Peruvians had no wheeled carriages, these roads were constructed for\r\nthe march of troops, for the conveyance of burthens borne by men, and\r\nfor flocks of lightly laden Lamas; consequently, long flights of\r\nsteps[116], with resting-places, were formed at intervals in the steep\r\nparts of the mountains. Francisco Pizarro and Diego Almagro, in their\r\nexpeditions to remote parts of the country, availed themselves with much\r\nadvantage of the military roads of the Incas; but the steps just\r\nmentioned were formidable impediments in the way of the Spanish cavalry,\r\nespecially as in the early period of the Conquista, the Spaniards rode\r\nhorses only, and did not make use of the sure-footed mule, which, in\r\nmountainous precipices, seems to reflect on every step he takes. It was\r\nonly at a later period that the Spanish troops were mounted on mules.\r\n\r\nSarmiento, who saw the Inca roads whilst they were in a perfect state of\r\npreservation, mentions them in a _Relacion_ which he wrote, and which\r\nlong lay buried in the Library of the Escurial. “How,” he asks, “could a\r\npeople, unacquainted with the use of iron, have constructed such great\r\nand magnificent roads, (_caminos tan grandes, y tan sovervios_), and in\r\nregions so elevated as the countries between Cuzco and Quito, and\r\nbetween Cuzco and the coast of Chili?” “The Emperor Charles,” he adds,\r\n“with all his power, could not have accomplished even a part of what was\r\ndone by the well-directed Government of the Incas, and the obedient race\r\nof people under its rule.” Hernando Pizarro, the most educated of the\r\nthree brothers, who expiated his misdeeds by twenty years of captivity\r\nin Medina del Campo, and who died at 100 years of age, in the odour of\r\nsanctity (_en olor de Santidad_), observes, alluding to the Inca roads:\r\n“Throughout the whole of Christendom, no such roads are to be seen as\r\nthose which we here admire.” Cuzco and Quito, the two principal capitals\r\nof the Incas, are situated in a direct line south-south-east,\r\nnorth-north-west in reference the one to the other. Their distance\r\napart, without calculating the many windings of the road, is 1000 miles;\r\nincluding the windings of the road, the distance is stated by Garcilaso\r\nde la Vega, and other Conquistadores, to be “500 Spanish leguas.”\r\nNotwithstanding this vast distance, we are informed, on the\r\nunquestionable testimony of the Licentiate Polo de Ondegardo, that\r\nHuayna Capac, whose father conquered Quito, caused certain materials to\r\nbe conveyed thither from Cuzco, for the erection of the royal buildings,\r\n(the Inca dwellings). In Quito, I found this tradition still current\r\namong the natives.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the form of the earth, nature presents to man formidable\r\ndifficulties to contend against, those very difficulties serve to\r\nstimulate the energy and courage of enterprising races of people. Under\r\nthe despotic centralizing system of the Inca Government, security and\r\nrapidity of communication, especially in relation to the movement of\r\ntroops, were matters of urgent state necessity. Hence the construction\r\nof great roads, and the establishment of very excellent postal\r\narrangements by the Peruvians. Among nations in the most various degrees\r\nof civilization, national energy is frequently observed to manifest\r\nitself, as it were by preference, in some special direction; but the\r\nadvancement consequent on this sort of partial exertion, however\r\nstrikingly exhibited, by no means affords a criterion of the general\r\ncultivation of a people. Egyptians, Greeks[117], Etruscans, and Romans,\r\nChinese, Japanese, and Indians, present examples of these contrasts. It\r\nwould be difficult to determine, what space of time may have been\r\noccupied in the execution of the Peruvian roads. Those great works, in\r\nthe northern part of the Inca Empire, on the table-land of Quito, must\r\ncertainly have been completed in less than thirty or thirty-five years;\r\nthat is to say, in the short interval between the defeat of the Ruler of\r\nQuito, and the death of the Inca Huayna Capac. With respect to the\r\nsouthern, or those specially styled the Peruvian roads, the period of\r\ntheir formation is involved in complete obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe date of the mysterious appearance of Manco Capac is usually fixed\r\n400 years prior to the arrival of Francisco Pizarro, (who landed on the\r\nIsland of Puná in the year 1532), consequently, about the middle of the\r\ntwelfth century, and full 200 years before the foundation of the city of\r\nMexico (Tenochtitlan); but instead of 400 years, some Spanish writers\r\nrepresent the interval between Manco Capac and Pizarro to have been 500,\r\nor even 550 years. However the history of the Peruvian empire records\r\nonly thirteen reigning princes of the Inca dynasty, which, as Prescott\r\njustly observes, is not a number sufficient to fill up so long a period\r\nas 550, or even 400 years. Quezalcoatl, Botchia, and Manco Capac, are\r\nthe three mythical beings, with whom are connected the earliest traces\r\nof cultivation among the Aztecs, the Muyscas, (properly Chibchas), and\r\nthe Peruvians. Quezalcoatl, who is described as bearded and clothed in\r\nblack, was High Priest of Tula, and afterwards a penitent, dwelling on a\r\nmountain near Tlaxapuchicalco. He is represented as having come from the\r\ncoast of Panuco; and, therefore, from the eastern part of Anahuac, on\r\nthe Mexican table-land. Botchia, or rather the bearded, long-robed\r\nNemterequeteba[118], (literally messenger of God, a Buddha of the\r\nMuyscas), came from the grassy steppes eastward of the Andes chain, to\r\nthe table-lands of Bogotá. Before the time of Manco Capac, some degree\r\nof civilization already existed on the picturesque shores of the Lake of\r\nTiticaca. The fortress of Cuzco, on the hill of Sacsahuaman, was built\r\non the model of the more ancient structures of Tiahuanaco. In like\r\nmanner, the Aztecs imitated the pyramidal buildings of the Toltecs, and\r\nthe latter copied those of the Olmecs (Hulmecs); and thus, by degrees,\r\nwe arrive at historic ground in Mexico as early as the sixth century of\r\nthe Christian era. According to Siguença, the Toltecic Step Pyramid of\r\nCholula, was copied from the Hulmecic Step Pyramid of Teotihuacan. Thus,\r\nthrough every stage of civilization, we pass into an earlier one, and as\r\nhuman intelligence was not aroused simultaneously in both continents, we\r\nfind that in every nation the imaginative domain of mythology\r\nimmediately preceded the period of historical knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe early Spanish Conquistadores were filled with admiration on first\r\nbeholding the roads and aqueducts of the Peruvians; yet not only did\r\nthey neglect the preservation of those great works, but they even\r\nwantonly destroyed them. As a natural consequence of the destruction of\r\nthe aqueducts, the soil was rendered unfertile by the want of\r\nirrigation. Nevertheless, those works, as well as the roads, were\r\ndemolished for the sake of obtaining stones ready hewn for the erection\r\nof new buildings; and the traces of this devastation are more observable\r\nnear the sea-coast, than on the ridges of the Andes, or in the deeply\r\ncleft valleys with which that mountain-chain is intersected. During our\r\nlong day’s journey from the syenitic rocks of Zaulac to the valley of\r\nSan Felipe, (rich in fossil remains and situated at the foot of the icy\r\nParamo of Yamoca), we had no less than twenty-seven times to ford the\r\nRio de Guancabamba, which falls into the Amazon. We were compelled to do\r\nthis on account of the numerous sinuosities of the stream, whilst on the\r\nbrow of a steep precipice near us, we had continually within our sight\r\nthe vestiges of the rectilinear Inca road, with its Tambos. The little\r\nmountain stream, the Rio de Guancabamba, is not more than from 120 to\r\n150 feet broad; yet so strong is the current, that our heavily laden\r\nmules were in continual danger of being swept away by it. The mules\r\ncarried our manuscripts, our dried plants, and all the other objects\r\nwhich we had been a whole year engaged in collecting; therefore, every\r\ntime that we crossed the stream, we stood on one of the banks in a state\r\nof anxious suspense until the long train of our beasts of burthen,\r\neighteen or twenty in number, were fairly out of danger.\r\n\r\nThis same Rio de Guancabamba, which in the lower part of its course has\r\nmany falls, is the channel for a curious mode of conveying\r\ncorrespondence from the coast of the Pacific. For the expeditious\r\ntransmission of the few letters that are sent from Truxillo to the\r\nprovince of Jaen de Bracamoros, they are despatched by a swimming\r\ncourier, or, as he is called by the people of the country, “_el correo\r\nque nada_.” This courier, who is usually a young Indian, swims in two\r\ndays from Pomahuaca to Tomependa; first proceeding by the Rio de\r\nChamaya, (the name given to the lower part of the Rio de Guancabamba)\r\nand then by the Amazon river. The few letters of which he is the bearer,\r\nhe carefully wraps in a large cotton handkerchief, which he rolls round\r\nhis head in the form of a turban. On arriving at those parts of the\r\nrivers in which there are falls or rapids, he lands, and goes by a\r\ncircuitous route through the woods. When wearied by long-continued\r\nswimming, he rests by throwing one arm on a plank of a light kind of\r\nwood of the family of the Bombaceæ, called by the Peruvians _Ceiba_, or\r\n_Palo de balsa_. Sometimes the swimming courier takes with him a friend\r\nto bear him company. Neither troubles himself about provisions, as they\r\nare always sure of a hospitable reception in the huts which are\r\nsurrounded by abundant fruit-trees in the beautiful Huertas of Pucara\r\nand Cavico.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the river is free from crocodiles, which are first met with\r\nin the upper course of the Amazon, below the cataract of Mayasi; for the\r\nslothful animal prefers to live in the more tranquil waters. According\r\nto my calculation, the Rio de Chamaya has a fall[119] of 1778 feet, in\r\nthe short distance of 52 geographical miles; that is to say, measuring\r\nfrom the Ford (_Paso_) de Pucara, to the point where the Chamaya\r\ndisembogues in the river Amazon, below the village of Choros. The\r\nGovernor of the province Jaen de Bracamoros assured me, that letters\r\nsent by the singular water post conveyance just mentioned, are seldom\r\neither wetted or lost. After my return from Mexico, I myself received,\r\nwhen in Paris, letters from Tomependa, which had been transmitted in\r\nthis manner. Many of the wild Indian tribes, who dwell on the shores of\r\nthe Upper Amazon, perform their journeys in a similar manner; swimming\r\nsociably down the stream in parties. On one occasion, I saw the heads of\r\nthirty or forty individuals, men, women, and children, of the tribe of\r\nthe Xibaros, as they floated down the stream on their way to Tomependa.\r\nThe _Correo que nada_ returns by land, taking the difficult route of the\r\nParamo del Paredon.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the hot climate of the basin of the Amazon, the aspect of\r\nbeautiful and occasionally very luxuriant vegetation delights the eye.\r\nNot even in the Canary Islands, nor on the warm coasts of Cumana and\r\nCaracas, had we beheld finer orange-trees than those which we met with\r\nin the Huertas de Pucara. They consisted chiefly of the sweet\r\norange-tree (_Citrus aurantium_, Risso); the bitter orange-tree (_Citrus\r\nvulgaris_, Risso) was less numerous. These trees, laden with their\r\ngolden fruit in thousands, attain there a height of between 60 and 70\r\nfeet; and their branches, instead of growing in such a way as to give\r\nthe trees rounded tops or crowns, shoot straight up like those of the\r\nlaurel. Near the ford of Cavico a very unexpected sight surprised us. We\r\nsaw a grove of small trees, about 18 or 19 feet high, the leaves of\r\nwhich, instead of being green, appeared to be of a rose colour. This\r\nproved to be a new species of Bougainvillæa, a genus first determined by\r\nJussieu the elder, from a Brazilian specimen in Commerson’s _Herbarium_.\r\nBut on a nearer approach we found that these trees were really without\r\nleaves, properly so called, and that what, from a distant view, we had\r\nmistaken for leaves, were bright rose-coloured bracts. Owing to the\r\npurity and freshness of the colour, the effect was totally different\r\nfrom that of the hue which so pleasingly clothes many of our\r\nforest-trees in autumn. The Rhopala ferruginea, a species of the South\r\nAfrican family of the Proteaceæ, has found its way hither, having\r\ndescended from the cool heights of the Paramo de Yamoca into the warm\r\nplains of the Chamaya. We likewise frequently saw here the beautifully\r\npinnated Porlieria hygrometrica, one of the Zygophylleæ, which, by the\r\nclosing of its leaves, indicates change of weather, generally the\r\napproach of rain. This plant is more certain in its tokens than any of\r\nthe Mimosaceæ, and it very rarely deceived us.\r\n\r\nAt Chamaya we found rafts (_balsas_) in readiness to convey us to\r\nTomependa, where we wished to determine the difference of longitude\r\nbetween Quito and the mouth of the Chinchipe; a point of some importance\r\nto the geography of South America on account of an old observation of La\r\nCondamine[120]. We slept as usual in the open air, and our resting-place\r\nwas on the sandy shore called the Playa de Guayanchi, at the confluence\r\nof the Rio de Chamaya and the Amazon. Next morning we proceeded down the\r\nlatter river as far as the Cataract and the Narrows, or the Pongo of\r\nRentema. Pongo, the name given to River Narrows by the natives, is a\r\ncorruption of the word _Puncu_, which, in the Quichua language,\r\nsignifies a door or gate. In the Pongo de Rentema huge masses of rock\r\nconsisting of coarse-grained sandstone (conglomerate), rise up like\r\ntowers and form a rocky dam across the stream. I measured a base line on\r\nthe flat sandy shore, and found that the Amazon River, which, further\r\neastwards, spreads into such mighty width, is, at Tomependa, scarcely\r\n1400 feet broad. In the celebrated River Narrows, called the Pongo de\r\nManseriche, between Santiago and San Borja, the breadth is less than 160\r\nfeet. The Pongo de Manseriche is formed by a mountain ravine, in some\r\nparts of which the overhanging rocks, roofed by a canopy of foliage,\r\npermit only a feeble light to penetrate, and by the force of the current\r\nall the drift-wood, consisting of trunks of trees in countless numbers,\r\nis broken and dashed to atoms. The rocks by which all these Pongos are\r\nformed, have, in the course of centuries, undergone many changes. The\r\nPongo de Rentema, which I have mentioned above, was, a year before my\r\nvisit to it, in part broken up by a high flood; indeed the inhabitants\r\nof the shores of the Amazon still preserve by tradition a lively\r\nrecollection of the sudden fall of the once lofty masses of rock along\r\nthe whole length of the Pongo. This fall took place in the early part of\r\nthe last century, and the debris suddenly dammed up the river and\r\nimpeded the current. The consequence was, that the inhabitants of the\r\nvillage of Puyaya, situated at the lower part of the Pongo de Rentema,\r\nwere filled with alarm on beholding the dry bed of the river; but, after\r\nthe lapse of a few hours, the waters recovered their usual course. There\r\nappears to be no reason for believing that these remarkable phenomena\r\nare occasioned by earthquakes. The river, which has a very strong\r\ncurrent, seems, as it were, to be incessantly labouring to improve its\r\nbed. Of the force of its efforts some idea may be formed from the fact\r\nthat, notwithstanding its vast breadth, it sometimes rises upwards of 26\r\nfeet above its ordinary level in the space of 20 or 30 hours.\r\n\r\nWe remained seventeen days in the hot valley of the Marañon or the\r\nAmazon River. To proceed from thence to the coast of the Pacific it is\r\nnecessary to cross the chain of the Andes, between Micuipampa and\r\nCaxamarca (in 6° 57′ S. lat., and 78° 34′ W. long.), at a point where,\r\naccording to my observations, it is intersected by the magnetic equator.\r\nAt a still higher elevation are situated the celebrated silver mines of\r\nChota. Then, after having passed the ancient Caxamarca (the scene, 316\r\nyears ago, of the most sanguinary drama in the history of the Spanish\r\nConquista), and also Aroma and Guangamarca, the route descends, with\r\nsome interruptions, into the Peruvian lowlands. Here, as in nearly all\r\nparts of the Andes, as well as of the Mexican Mountains, the highest\r\npoints are picturesquely marked by tower-like masses of erupted porphyry\r\nand trachyte, the former frequently presenting the effect of immense\r\ncolumns. In some places these masses give a rugged cliff-like aspect to\r\nthe mountain ridges; and in other places they assume the form of domes\r\nor cupolas. They have here broken through a formation, which, in South\r\nAmerica, is extensively developed on both sides of the equator, and\r\nwhich Leopold von Buch, after profound research, has pronounced to be\r\ncretaceous. Between Guambos and Montan, nearly 12,800 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, we found marine fossils[121] (Ammonites about 15\r\ninches in diameter, the large Pecten alatus, oyster-shells, Echini,\r\nIsocardias, and Exogyra polygona). A species of Cidaris, which, in the\r\nopinion of Leopold von Buch, does not differ from one found by\r\nBrongniart in the old chalk at the Perte du Rhone, we collected in the\r\nbasin of the Amazon at Tomependa, and likewise at Micuipampa; that is to\r\nsay, at elevations differing the one from the other by no less than\r\n10,550 feet. In like manner, in the Amuich chain of the Caucasian\r\nDaghestan, the chalk of the banks of the Sulak, scarcely 530 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, is again found on the Tchunum, at the elevation of\r\nfull 9,600 feet, whilst, on the summit of the Shadagh Mountain, 13,950\r\nfeet high, the Ostrea diluviana (Goldf.), and the same chalk, present\r\nthemselves. Abich’s admirable Caucasian observations furnish the most\r\ndecided confirmation of Leopold von Buch’s geognostic views respecting\r\nthe cretaceous Alpine development.\r\n\r\nFrom the solitary farm of Montan, surrounded with flocks of Lamas, we\r\nascended further southward the eastern declivity of the Cordilleras,\r\nuntil we reached the level height in which is situated the argentiferous\r\nmountain Gualgayoc, the principal site of the far-famed mines of Chota.\r\nNight was just drawing in, and an extraordinary spectacle presented\r\nitself to our observation. The Cerro de Gualgayoc is separated by a deep\r\ncleft-like valley (Quebrada), from the limestone mountain Cormolache.\r\nThe latter is an isolated hornstone rock, presenting, on the northern\r\nand western sides, almost perpendicular precipices, and containing\r\ninnumerable veins of silver, which frequently intersect and run into\r\neach other. The highest shafts are 1540 feet above the floor of the\r\nstoll or groundwork, called the Socabon de Espinachi. The outline of the\r\nmountain is broken by numerous tower-like points and pyramidal notches;\r\nand hence the summit of the Cerro de Gualgayoc bears the name of Las\r\nPuntas. This mountain presents a most decided contrast to that\r\nsmoothness of surface which miners are accustomed to regard as\r\ncharacteristic of metalliferous districts. “Our mountain,” said a\r\nwealthy mine-owner whom we visited, “looks like an enchanted castle\r\n(_como si fuese un castillo encantado_).” The Gualgayoc bears some\r\nresemblance to a cone of dolomite, but it is still more like the notched\r\nridges of the Mountain of Monserrat in Catalonia, which I have also\r\nvisited, and which has been so pleasingly described by my brother. Not\r\nonly is the silver mountain Gualgayoc perforated on every side, and to\r\nits very summit, by many hundred large shafts, but the mass of the\r\nsiliceous rock is cleft by natural openings, through which the dark blue\r\nsky of these elevated regions is visible to the observer standing at the\r\nfoot of the mountain. The people of the country call these openings\r\nwindows (_Las ventanillas de Gualgayoc_). On the trachytic walls of the\r\nvolcano of Pichincha similar openings were pointed out to us, and there,\r\nlikewise, they were called windows, (_Ventanillas de Pichincha_.) The\r\nsingular aspect of the Gualgayoc is not a little increased by numerous\r\nsheds and habitations, which lie scattered like nests over the\r\nfortress-looking mountain wherever a level spot admits of their\r\nerection. The miners carry the ore in baskets, down steep and dangerous\r\nfootpaths, to the places where it is submitted to the process of\r\namalgamation.\r\n\r\nThe value of the silver obtained from the mines of Gualgayoc during the\r\nfirst thirty years of their being worked, from 1771 to 1802, is supposed\r\nto have amounted to upwards of thirty-two millions of piastres.\r\nNotwithstanding the hardness of the quartzose rock, the Peruvians, even\r\nbefore the arrival of the Spaniards, extracted rich argentiferous galena\r\nfrom the Cerro de la Lin, and also from the Chupiquiyacu; of this fact\r\nmany old shafts and galleries bear evidence. The Peruvians also obtained\r\ngold from the Curimayo, where also natural sulphur is found in the\r\nquartz rock as well as in the Brazilian Itacolumite. We took up our\r\ntemporary abode, in the vicinity of the mines, in the little mountain\r\ntown of Micuipampa, situated at an elevation of 11,873 feet above the\r\nsea, and where, though only 6° 43′ from the equator, water freezes\r\nwithin doors, at night, during a great part of the year. This\r\nwilderness, almost devoid of vegetation, is inhabited by 3000 or 4000\r\npersons, who are supplied with articles of food from the warm valleys,\r\nas they themselves can grow nothing but some kinds of cabbage and salad,\r\nthe latter exceedingly good. Here, as in all the mining towns of Peru,\r\n_ennui_ drives the richer inhabitants, who, however, are not the best\r\ninformed class, to the dangerous diversions of cards and dice. The\r\nconsequence is, that the wealth thus quickly won is still more quickly\r\nspent. Here one is continually reminded of the anecdote related of one\r\nof the soldiers of Pizarro’s army, who complained that he had lost in\r\none night’s play, “a large piece of the sun,” meaning a plate of gold\r\nwhich he had obtained at the plunder of the Temple of Cuzco. At\r\nMicuipampa the thermometer, at eight in the morning, stood at 34°.2, and\r\nat noon, at 47°.8 Fahrenheit. Among the thin Ichhu-grass (possibly our\r\nStipa eriostachya), we found a beautiful Calceolaria (_C.\r\nSibthorpioides_), which we should not have expected to see at such an\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\nNear the town of Micuipampa there is a high plain called the Llano or\r\nthe Pampa de Navar. In this plain there have been found, extending over\r\na surface of more than four English square miles, and immediately under\r\nthe turf, immense masses of red gold ore and wire-like threads of pure\r\nsilver. These are called by the Peruvian miners _remolinos_, _clavos_,\r\nand _vetas manteadas_, and they are overgrown by the roots of the Alpine\r\ngrasses. Another level plain, to the west of the Purgatorio, and near\r\nthe Quebrada de Chiquera, is called the Choropampa (the Muscle-Shell\r\nPlain), the word _churu_ signifying in the Quichua language a muscle or\r\ncockle, particularly a small eatable kind, which the people of the\r\ncountry now distinguish by their Spanish names _hostion_ or _mexillon_.\r\nThe name Choropampa refers to fossils of the cretaceous formation, which\r\nin this plain are found in such immense numbers that at an early period\r\nthey attracted the attention of the natives. In the Choropampa there has\r\nbeen found near the surface of the earth, a rich mass of pure gold, spun\r\nround, as it were, with threads of silver. This fact proves how slight\r\nmay be the affinity between many of the ores upheaved from the interior\r\nof the earth, through fissures and veins, and the nature of the adjacent\r\nrock, and how little relative antiquity exists between them and that of\r\nthe formation they have broken through. The rock of the Gualgayoc, as\r\nwell as that of the Fuentestiana, is very watery, whilst in the\r\nPurgatorio perfect dryness prevails. In the Purgatorio, notwithstanding\r\nthe height of the strata above the sea-level, I found to my\r\nastonishment, that the temperature in the mine was 67°.4 Fahr., whilst\r\nin the neighbouring Mina de Guadalupe the water in the mine was about\r\n52°.2 Fahr. In the open air the thermometer indicates only 42°.1 Fahr.,\r\nand the miners, who labour very hard, and who work almost without\r\nclothing, say that the subterranean heat in the Purgatorio is stifling.\r\n\r\nThe narrow path from Micuipampa to the ancient Inca city Caxamarca is\r\ndifficult even for mules. The original name of the town was Cassamarca\r\nor Kazamarca, that is to say, the City of Frost. Marca, in the\r\nsignification of a district or town, belongs to the northern dialect of\r\nthe Chinchaysuyo, or the Chinchasuyu, whilst in the common Quichua\r\nlanguage the word means the story of a house, and also a fortress and\r\nplace of defence. For the space of five or six miles, the road led us\r\nthrough a succession of Paramos, where we were without intermission\r\nexposed to the fury of a boisterous wind and the sharp angular hail\r\npeculiar to the ridges of the Andes. The height of the road is for the\r\nmost part between 9600 and 10,700 feet above the sea-level. There I had\r\nthe opportunity of making a magnetic observation of general interest,\r\nviz., for determining the point where the north inclination of the\r\nneedle passes into the south inclination, and also the point at which\r\nthe traveller has to cross the magnetic equator[122].\r\n\r\nHaving at length reached the last of these mountain wildernesses, the\r\nParamo de Yanaguanga, the traveller joyfully looks down into the fertile\r\nvalley of Caxamarca. It presents a charming prospect, for the valley,\r\nthrough which winds a little serpentine rivulet, is an elevated plain of\r\nan oval form, in extent from 96 to 112 square miles. The plain bears a\r\nresemblance to that of Bogota, and like it is probably the bed of an\r\nancient lake; but in Caxamarca there is wanting the myth of the\r\nmiracle-working Botchia, or Idacanzas, the High Priest of Iraca, who\r\nopened a passage for the waters through the rocks of Tequendama.\r\nCaxamarca lies 640 feet higher than Santa Fé de Bogota, and consequently\r\nits elevation is equal to that of the city of Quito; but being sheltered\r\nby surrounding mountains, its climate is much more mild and agreeable.\r\nThe soil of Caxamarca is extraordinarily fertile. In every direction are\r\nseen cultivated fields and gardens, intersected by avenues of willows,\r\nvarieties of the Datura (bearing large red, white, and yellow flowers),\r\nMimosas, and beautiful Quinuar trees (our Polylepsis villosa, a Rosacea\r\napproximating to the Alchemilla and Sanguisorba). The wheat harvest in\r\nthe Pampa de Caxamarca is, on the average, from fifteen to twenty-fold;\r\nbut the prospect of abundant crops is sometimes blighted by night\r\nfrosts, caused by the radiation of heat towards the cloudless sky, in\r\nthe strata of dry and rarefied mountain air. These night frosts are not\r\nfelt within the roofed dwellings.\r\n\r\nSmall mounds, or hillocks, of porphyry (once perhaps islands in the\r\nancient lake) are studded over the northern part of the plain, and break\r\nthe wide expanse of smooth sandstone. From the summit of one of these\r\nporphyry hillocks, we enjoyed a most beautiful prospect of the Cerro de\r\nSanta Polonia. The ancient residence of Atahuallpa is on this side,\r\nsurrounded by fruit gardens, and irrigated fields of lucern (Medicago\r\nsativa), called by the people here _Campos de alfalfa_. In the distance\r\nare seen columns of smoke, rising from the warm baths of Pultamarca,\r\nwhich still hear the name of Baños del Inca. I found the temperature of\r\nthese sulphuric springs to be 156°.2 Fahr. Atahuallpa was accustomed to\r\nspend a portion of each year at these baths, where some slight remains\r\nof his palace have survived the ravages of the Conquistadores. The large\r\ndeep basin or reservoir (_el tragadero_) for supplying these baths with\r\nwater, appeared to me, judging from its regular circular form, to have\r\nbeen artificially cut in the sandstone rock, over one of the fissures\r\nwhence the spring flows. Tradition records that one of the Inca’s\r\nsedan-chairs, made of gold, was sunk in this basin, and that all\r\nendeavours to recover it have proved vain.\r\n\r\nOf the fortress and palace of Atahuallpa, there also remain but few\r\nvestiges in the town, which now contains some beautiful churches. Even\r\nbefore the close of the sixteenth century, the thirst for gold\r\naccelerated the work of destruction, for, with the view of discovering\r\nhidden treasures, walls were demolished and the foundations of buildings\r\nrecklessly undermined. The Inca’s palace is situated on a hill of\r\nporphyry, which was originally cut and hollowed out from the surface,\r\ncompletely through the rock, so that the latter surrounds the main\r\nbuilding like a wall. Portions of the ruins have been converted to the\r\npurposes of a town jail and a Municipal Hall (Casa del Cabildo). The\r\nmost curious parts of these ruins, which however are not more than\r\nbetween 13 and 16 feet in height, are those opposite to the monastery of\r\nSan Francisco. These vestiges, like the remains of the dwelling of the\r\nCaciques, consist of finely-hewn blocks of free-stone, two or three feet\r\nlong, laid one upon another without cement, as in the Inca-Pilca, or\r\nfortress of the Cañar, in the high plain of Quito.\r\n\r\nIn the porphyritic rock there is a shaft which once led to subterraneous\r\nchambers and into a gallery, (by miners called a stoll,) from which, it\r\nis alleged, there was a communication with the other porphyritic rocks\r\nalready mentioned;—those situated at Santa Polonia. These arrangements\r\nbear evidence of having been made as precautions against the events of\r\nwar, and for the security of flight. The burying of treasure was a\r\ncustom very generally practised among the Peruvians in former times; and\r\nsubterraneous chambers still exist beneath many private dwellings in\r\nCaxamarca.\r\n\r\nWe were shown some steps cut in the rock, and the footbath used by the\r\nInca (_el lavatorio de los pies_). The operation of washing the\r\nsovereign’s feet was performed amidst tedious court ceremonies[123].\r\nSeveral lateral structures, which, according to tradition, were allotted\r\nto the attendants of the Inca, are built some of free-stone with gable\r\nroofs, and others of regularly shaped bricks, alternating with layers of\r\nsiliceous cement. The buildings constructed in this last-mentioned\r\nstyle, to which the Peruvians give the name of _Muros y obra de tapia_,\r\nhave little arched niches or recesses. Of their antiquity I was for a\r\nlong time doubtful, though I am now convinced that my doubts were not\r\nwell-grounded.\r\n\r\nIn the principal building, the room is still shown in which the\r\nunfortunate Atahuallpa was confined for the space of nine months, from\r\nthe date of November, 1532[124]. The notice of the traveller is still\r\ndirected to the wall, on which he made a mark to denote to what height\r\nhe would fill the room with gold, on condition of his being set free.\r\nThis height is variously described. Xerez in the _Conquista del Peru_\r\n(which Barcia has preserved to us), Hernando Pizarro in his letters, and\r\nother writers, all give different accounts of it. The captive monarch\r\nsaid, “that gold in bars, plates, and vessels should be piled up as high\r\nas he could reach with his hand.” The dimensions of the room, as given\r\nby Xerez, are equivalent to 23 feet in length and 18 in breadth.\r\nGarcilaso de la Vega, who quitted Peru in 1560, in his twentieth year,\r\nestimates that the treasures brought from the temples of the Sun in\r\nCuzco, Huaylas, Huamachuco, and Pachacamac, up to the fatal 29th of\r\nAugust, 1533, the day of the Inca’s death, amounted to 3,838,000 ducados\r\nde oro[125].\r\n\r\nIn the chapel of the town jail, which, as I have mentioned above, is\r\nerected on the ruins of the Inca Palace, a stone, stained, as it is\r\nalleged, with “indelible spots of blood,” is viewed with horror by the\r\ncredulous. It is placed in front of the altar, and consists of an\r\nextremely thin slab, about 13 feet in length, probably a portion of the\r\nporphyry or trachyte of the vicinity. To make an accurate examination of\r\nthis stone, by chipping a piece off, would not be permitted. The three\r\nor four spots, said to be blood stains, appear in reality to be nothing\r\nbut hornblende and pyroxide run together in the fundamental mass of the\r\nrock. The Licentiate Fernando Montesinos, though he visited Peru\r\nscarcely a hundred years after the taking of Caxamarca, gave currency to\r\nthe fabulous story that Atahuallpa was beheaded in prison, and that\r\ntraces of blood were still visible on a stone on which the execution had\r\ntaken place. There appears no reason to question the fact, since it is\r\nborne out by the testimony of many eye-witnesses, that the Inca\r\nwillingly allowed himself to be baptized by his cruel and fanatical\r\npersecutor, the Dominican monk, Vicente de Valverde. He received the\r\nname of Juan de Atahuallpa, and submitted to the ceremony of baptism to\r\navoid being burnt alive. He was put to death by strangulation (_el\r\ngarrote_), and his execution took place publicly in the open air.\r\nAnother tradition relates that a chapel was erected above the stone on\r\nwhich Atahuallpa was strangled, and that the remains of the Inca repose\r\nbeneath that stone. Supposing this to be correct, the alleged spots of\r\nblood are not accounted for. The fact is, however, that the body was\r\nnever deposited under the stone in question. After the performance of a\r\nmass for the dead and other solemn funeral ceremonies, at which the\r\nbrothers Pizarro were present in deep mourning(!), the body was conveyed\r\nfirst to the cemetery of the Convento de San Francisco, and afterwards\r\nto Quito, Atahuallpa’s birthplace. This removal to Quito was in\r\ncompliance with the wish expressed by the Inca prior to his death. His\r\npersonal enemy, the crafty Rumiñavi, from artful political motives,\r\ncaused the body to be interred in Quito with great solemnity. Rumiñavi\r\n(literally the stone-eye) received this name from a defect in one of his\r\neyes, occasioned by a wart. (In the Quichua language _rumi_ signifies\r\nstone, and _ñavi_ eye.)\r\n\r\nDescendants of the Inca still dwell in Caxamarca, amidst the dreary\r\narchitectural ruins of departed splendour. These descendants are the\r\nfamily of the Indian Cacique, or, as he is called in the Quichua\r\nlanguage, the Curaca Astorpilca. They live in great poverty, but\r\nnevertheless contented and resigned to their hard and unmerited fate.\r\nTheir descent from Atahuallpa, through the female line, has never been a\r\ndoubtful question in Caxamarca; but traces of beard would seem to\r\nindicate some admixture of Spanish blood. Huascar and Atahuallpa, two\r\nsons of the great Huayna Capac (who for a child of the Sun was somewhat\r\ndisposed to free-thinking)[126], reigned in succession before the\r\ninvasion of the Spaniards. Neither of these two princes left any\r\nacknowledged male heirs. In the plains of Quipaypan, Huascar was made\r\nprisoner by Atahuallpa, by whose order he was shortly after secretly put\r\nto death. Atahuallpa had two other brothers. One was the insignificant\r\nyouth Toparca, who in the autumn of 1533 Pizarro caused to be crowned as\r\nInca; and the other was the enterprising Manco Capac, who was likewise\r\ncrowned, but who afterwards rebelled: neither of these two princes left\r\nany known male issue. Atahuallpa indeed left two children; one a son,\r\nwho received in Christian baptism the name of Don Francisco, and who\r\ndied young; the other a daughter, Doña Angelina, who became the mistress\r\nof Francisco Pizarro, with whom she led a wild camp life. Doña Angelina\r\nhad a son by Pizarro, and to this grandson of the slaughtered monarch\r\nthe Conqueror was fondly attached. Besides the family of Astorpilca,\r\nwith whom I became acquainted in Caxamarca, the families of Carguaraicos\r\nand Titu-Buscamayca were, at the time I visited Peru, regarded as\r\ndescendants of the Inca dynasty. The race of Buscamayca has since that\r\ntime become extinct.\r\n\r\nThe son of the Cacique Astorpilca, an interesting and amiable youth of\r\nseventeen, conducted us over the ruins of the ancient palace. Though\r\nliving in the utmost poverty, his imagination was filled with images of\r\nthe subterranean splendour and the golden treasures which, he assured\r\nus, lay hidden beneath the heaps of rubbish over which we were treading.\r\nHe told us that one of his ancestors once blindfolded the eyes of his\r\nwife, and then, through many intricate passages cut in the rock, led her\r\ndown into the subterranean gardens of the Inca. There the lady beheld,\r\nskilfully imitated in the purest gold, trees laden with leaves and\r\nfruit, with birds perched on their branches. Among other things, she saw\r\nAtahuallpa’s gold sedan-chair (_una de las andas_) which had been so\r\nlong searched for in vain, and which is alleged to have sunk in the\r\nbasin at the Baths of Pultamarca. The husband commanded his wife not to\r\ntouch any of these enchanted treasures, reminding her that the period\r\nfixed for the restoration of the Inca empire had not yet arrived, and\r\nthat whosoever should touch any of the treasures would perish that same\r\nnight. These golden dreams and fancies of the youth were founded on\r\nrecollections and traditions transmitted from remote times. Golden\r\ngardens, such as those alluded to (_Jardines ó huertas de oro_), have\r\nbeen described by various writers who allege that they actually saw\r\nthem; viz., by Cieza de Leon, Parmento, Garcilaso, and other early\r\nhistorians of the Conquista. They are said to have existed beneath the\r\nTemple of the Sun at Cuzco, at Caxamarca, and in the lovely valley of\r\nYucay, which was a favourite seat of the sovereign family. In places in\r\nwhich the golden Huertas were not under ground, but in the open air,\r\nliving plants were mingled with the artificial ones. Among the latter,\r\nparticular mention is always made of the high shoots of maize and the\r\nmaize-cobs (_mazorcas_) as having been most successfully imitated.\r\n\r\nThe son of Astorpilca assured me that underground, a little to the right\r\nof the spot on which I then stood, there was a large Datura tree, or\r\nGuanto, in full flower, exquisitely made of gold wire and plates of\r\ngold, and that its branches overspread the Inca’s chair. The morbid\r\nfaith with which the youth asserted his belief in this fabulous story,\r\nmade a profound and melancholy impression on me. These illusions are\r\ncherished among the people here, as affording them consolation amidst\r\ngreat privation and earthly suffering. I said to the lad, “Since you and\r\nyour parents so firmly believe in the existence of these gardens, do you\r\nnot, in your poverty, sometimes feel a wish to dig for the treasures\r\nthat lie so near you?” The young Peruvian’s answer was so simple and so\r\nexpressive of the quiet resignation peculiar to the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants of the country, that I noted it down in Spanish in my\r\nJournal. “Such a desire (_tal antojo_),” said he, “never comes to us. My\r\nfather says that it would be sinful (_que fuese pecado_). If we had the\r\ngolden branches, with all their golden fruits, our white neighbours\r\nwould hate us and injure us. We have a little field and good wheat\r\n(_buen trigo_).” Few of my readers will I trust be displeased that I\r\nhave recalled here the words of young Astorpilca and his golden dreams.\r\n\r\nAn idea generally spread and firmly believed among the natives is, that\r\nit would be criminal to dig up and take possession of treasures which\r\nmay have belonged to the Incas, and that such a proceeding would bring\r\nmisfortune upon the whole Peruvian race. This idea is closely connected\r\nwith that of the restoration of the Inca dynasty, an event which is\r\nstill expected, and which in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was\r\nlooked forward to with especial confidence. Oppressed nations always\r\nfondly hope for the day of their emancipation, and for the\r\nre-establishment of their old forms of government. The flight of Manco\r\nInca, the brother of Atahuallpa, who retreated into the forests of\r\nVilcapampa, on the declivity of the Eastern Cordillera; and the abode of\r\nSayri Tapac and Inca Tupac Amaru in those wildernesses, are events which\r\nhave left lasting recollections in the minds of the people. It is\r\nbelieved that descendants of the dethroned dynasty settled still further\r\neastward in Guiana, between the rivers Apurimac and Beni. These notions\r\nwere strengthened by the myth of _el Dorado_ and the golden city of\r\nManoa, which popular credulity carried from the west and propagated\r\neastward. So greatly was the imagination of Sir Walter Raleigh inflamed\r\nby these dreams, that he raised an expedition in the hope of conquering\r\n“the imperial and golden city.” There he proposed to establish a\r\ngarrison of three or four thousand English, and to levy from “the\r\nEmperor of Guiana, a descendant of Huayna Capac, and who holds his Court\r\nwith the same magnificence, an annual tribute of £300,000 sterling, as\r\nthe price of the promised restoration to the throne in Cuzco and\r\nCaxamarca.” Wherever the Peruvian Quichua language prevails, traces of\r\nthe expected restoration of the Inca rule[127] exist in the minds of\r\nmany of the natives possessing any knowledge of their national history.\r\n\r\nWe remained five days in the capital of the Inca Atahuallpa, which, at\r\nthat time, numbered only 7000 or 8000 inhabitants. Our departure was\r\ndelayed by the necessity of obtaining a great number of mules to convey\r\nour collections, and of selecting careful guides to conduct us across\r\nthe chain of the Andes to the entrance of the long but narrow Peruvian\r\nsandy desert called the _Desierto de Sechura_. Our route across the\r\nCordilleras lay from north-east to south-west. Having passed over the\r\nold bed of the lake, on the pleasant level height of Caxamarca, we\r\nascended an eminence at an elevation of scarcely 10,230 feet: and we\r\nwere then surprised by the sight of two strangely-shaped porphyritic\r\nmounds called the Aroma and the Cunturcaga. The latter is a favourite\r\nhaunt of the gigantic vulture, which we call the Condor; _kacca_, in the\r\nQuichua language, signifying _the rocks_. The porphyritic heights just\r\nmentioned are in the form of columns having five, six, or seven sides,\r\nfrom 37 to 42 feet in height, and some of them are crooked and bent as\r\nif in joints. Those which crown the Cerro Aroma are remarkably\r\npicturesque. The peculiar distribution of the columns, which are ranged\r\nin rows one above another, and frequently converging, presents the\r\nappearance of a two-storied building, roofed by a dome of massive rock,\r\nwhich is not columnar. These erupted masses of porphyry and trachyte\r\nare, as I have on a former occasion remarked, characteristic of the\r\nridges of the Andes, to which they impart a physiognomy totally\r\ndifferent from that of the Swiss Alps, the Pyrenees, and the Siberian\r\nAltai.\r\n\r\nFrom Cunturcaga and Aroma we descended, by a zigzag route, a steep\r\ndeclivity of 6400 feet into the cleft-like valley of the Magdalena, the\r\nlowest part of which is 4260 feet above the sea level. Here there is an\r\nIndian village consisting of a few miserable huts, surrounded by the\r\nsame species of cotton-trees (_Bombax discolor_), which we first\r\nobserved on the banks of the Amazon. The scanty vegetation of the valley\r\nof Magdalena somewhat resembles that of the province of Jaen de\r\nBracamoros, but we missed, with regret, the red groves of Bougainvillæa.\r\nMagdalena is one of the deepest valleys I have seen in the chain of the\r\nAndes. It is a decided cleft, running transversely from east to west,\r\nand bounded on each side by the Altos of Aroma and Guangamarca. Here\r\nrecommences the same quartz formation which was so long enigmatical to\r\nme. We had previously observed it in the Paramo de Yanaguanga, between\r\nMicuipampa and Caxamarca, at an elevation of 11,722 feet, and on the\r\nwestern declivity of the Cordillera it attains the thickness of many\r\nthousand feet. Since Leopold von Buch has proved that the cretaceous\r\nformation is widely extended, even in the highest chains of the Andes,\r\nand on both sides of the isthmus of Panama, it may be concluded that the\r\nquartz formation, of which I have just made mention (perhaps transformed\r\nin its texture by the action of volcanic power), belongs to the free\r\nsandstone intervening between the inner chalk and the gault and\r\ngreensand. From the genial valley of the Magdalena we again proceeded\r\nwestward, and, for the space of two hours and a half, we ascended a\r\nsteep wall of rock 5116 feet high, which rises opposite to the\r\nporphyritic groups of the Alto de Aroma. In this ascent we felt the\r\nchange of temperature the more sensibly, as the rocky acclivity was\r\nfrequently overhung with cold mist.\r\n\r\nAfter having travelled for eighteen months without intermission, within\r\nthe restricted boundaries of the interior of a mountainous country, we\r\nfelt an ardent desire to enjoy a view of the open sea, a desire which\r\nwas heightened by repeated disappointments. Looking from the summit of\r\nthe volcano of Pichincha, over the thick forests of the Provincia de las\r\nEsmeraldas, no sea horizon is distinctly discernible owing to the great\r\ndistance and the height of the point of view. It is like looking down\r\nfrom a balloon into empty space; the fancy divines objects which the eye\r\ncannot distinguish. Afterwards, when, between Loxa and Guancabamba, we\r\narrived at the Paramo de Guamani (where there are many ruins of\r\nbuildings of the times of the Incas), our mule-drivers confidently\r\nassured us that, beyond the plain, on the other side of the low\r\ndistricts of Piura and Lambajeque, we should have a view of the sea. But\r\na thick mist overhung the plain and obscured the distant coast. We\r\nbeheld only variously-shaped masses of rock, now rising like islands\r\nabove the waving sea of mist, and now vanishing. It was a view similar\r\nto that which we had from the Peak of Teneriffe. We experienced a\r\nsimilar disappointment whilst proceeding through the Andes Pass of\r\nGuangamarca, which I am now describing. Whilst we toiled along the\r\nridges of the mighty mountain, with expectation on the stretch, our\r\nguides, who were not very well acquainted with the way, repeatedly\r\nassured us that, after proceeding another mile, our hopes would be\r\nfulfilled. The stratum of mist, in which we were enveloped, seemed\r\nsometimes to disperse for a moment, but whenever that happened, our view\r\nwas bounded by intervening heights.\r\n\r\nThe desire which we feel to behold certain objects is not excited solely\r\nby their grandeur, their beauty, or their importance. In each individual\r\nthis desire is interwoven with pleasing impressions of youth, with early\r\npredilections for particular pursuits, with the inclination for\r\ntravelling, and the love of an active life. In proportion as the\r\nfulfilment of a wish may have appeared improbable, its realization\r\naffords the greater pleasure. The traveller enjoys, in anticipation, the\r\nhappy moment when he shall first behold the constellation of the Cross,\r\nand the Magellanic clouds circling over the South Pole; when he shall\r\ncome in sight of the snow of the Chimborazo, and of the column of smoke\r\nascending from the volcano of Quito; when, for the first time, he shall\r\ngaze on a grove of tree-ferns, or on the wide expanse of the Pacific\r\nOcean. The days on which such wishes are fulfilled mark epochs in life,\r\nand create indelible impressions; exciting feelings which require not to\r\nbe accounted for by any process of reasoning. The longing wish I felt to\r\nbehold the Pacific from the lofty ridges of the Andes was mingled with\r\nrecollections of the interest with which, as a boy, I had dwelt on the\r\nnarrative of the adventurous expedition of Vasco Nunez de Balboa[128].\r\nThat happy man, whose track Pizarro followed, was the first to behold,\r\nfrom the heights of Quarequa, on the isthmus of Panama, the eastern part\r\nof the great “South Sea.” The reedy shores of the Caspian, viewed from\r\nthe point whence I first beheld them, viz., from the Delta formed by the\r\nmouths of the Volga, cannot certainly be called picturesque, yet the\r\ndelight I felt on first beholding them, was enhanced by the recollection\r\nthat, in my very earliest childhood, I had been taught to observe, on\r\nthe map, the form of the Asiatic inland sea. The impressions aroused\r\nwithin us in early childhood, or excited by the accidental circumstances\r\nof life[129], frequently, in after years, take a graver direction, and\r\nbecome stimulants to scientific labours and great enterprises.\r\n\r\nAfter passing over many undulations of ground, on the rugged mountain\r\nridges, we at length reached the highest point of the Alto de\r\nGuangamarca. The sky, which had so long been obscured, now suddenly\r\nbrightened. A sharp south-west breeze dispersed the veil of mist; and\r\nthe dark blue canopy of heaven was seen between the narrow lines of the\r\nhighest feathery clouds. The whole western declivity of the Cordillera\r\n(adjacent to Chorillos and Cascas), covered with huge blocks of quartz\r\n13 or 15 feet long; and the plains of Chala and Molinos, as far as the\r\nsea coast near Truxillo, lay extended before our eyes, with a wonderful\r\neffect of apparent proximity. We now, for the first time, commanded a\r\nview of the Pacific. We saw it distinctly; reflecting along the line of\r\nthe coast an immense mass of light, and rising in immeasurable expanse\r\nuntil bounded by the clearly-defined horizon. The delight which my\r\ncompanions, Bonpland and Carlos Montufar, shared with me in viewing this\r\nprospect, caused us to forget to open the barometer on the Alto de\r\nGuangamarca. According to a calculation which we made at a place\r\nsomewhat lower down (an isolated farm called the Hato de Guangamarca),\r\nthe point at which we first gained a view of the ocean, must have been\r\nat no greater an elevation than between 9380 and 9600 feet.\r\n\r\nThe view of the Pacific was solemnly impressive to one, who, like\r\nmyself, was greatly indebted for the formation of his mind, and the\r\ndirection given to his tastes and aspirations, to one of the companions\r\nof Captain Cook. I made known the general outline of my travelling\r\nschemes to John Forster, when I had the advantage of visiting England\r\nunder his guidance, now more than half a century ago. Forster’s charming\r\npictures of Otaheite had awakened throughout Northern Europe a deep\r\ninterest (mingled with a sort of romantic longing), in favour of the\r\nislands of the Pacific Ocean. At that period, when but few Europeans had\r\nbeen fortunate enough to visit those islands, I cherished the hope of\r\nseeing them, at least in part; for the object of my visit to Lima was\r\ntwofold: first, to observe the transit of Mercury over the solar disc,\r\nand secondly, to fulfil a promise I had made to Captain Baudin, on my\r\ndeparture from Paris. This promise was to join him in the\r\ncircumnavigatory voyage which he was to undertake as soon as the French\r\nRepublic could furnish the necessary funds.\r\n\r\nAmerican papers circulated in the Antilles announced that the two French\r\ncorvettes, _Le Géographe_ and _Le Naturaliste_, were to sail round Cape\r\nHorn, and to touch at Callao de Lima. This information, which I received\r\nwhen in the Havannah, after having completed my Orinoco journey, caused\r\nme to relinquish my original plan of proceeding through Mexico to the\r\nPhilippines. I lost no time in engaging a ship to convey me from Cuba to\r\nCarthagena de Indias. But Captain Baudin’s expedition took quite a\r\ndifferent course from that which had been expected and announced.\r\nInstead of proceeding by the way of Cape Horn, as had been intended at\r\nthe time when it was agreed that Bonpland and I should join it, the\r\nexpedition sailed round the Cape of Good Hope. One of the objects of my\r\nvisit to Peru, and of my last journey across the chain of the Andes, was\r\nthus thwarted; but I had the singular good fortune, at a very\r\nunfavourable season of the year, in the misty regions of Lower Peru, to\r\nenjoy a clear bright day. In Callao I observed the passage of Mercury\r\nover the sun’s disc, an observation of some importance in aiding the\r\naccurate determination of the longitude of Lima[130], and of the\r\nsouth-western part of the new continent. Thus, amidst the serious\r\ntroubles and disappointments of life, there may often be found a grain\r\nof consolation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ILLUSTRATIONS AND ADDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 111:\r\n\r\n  p. 390—“_On the Ridge of the Andes or Antis._”\r\n\r\n  The Inca Garcilaso, who was well acquainted with the native language\r\n  of his country, and who loved to trace etymologies, invariably calls\r\n  the chain of the Andes, “las Montañas de los Antis.” He states\r\n  positively that the great mountain-chain, eastward of Cuzco, derives\r\n  its name from the race of the Antis and from the province Anti, which\r\n  was situated to the east of the capital of the Incas. The quaternary\r\n  divisions of the Peruvian empire, according to the four cardinal\r\n  points, reckoning from Cuzco, did not derive their names from the very\r\n  circumstantial words (having reference to the sun) which in the\r\n  Quichua language signify east, west, north, and south (intip\r\n  llucsinanpata, intip yaucunanpata, intip chaututa chayananpata, intip\r\n  chaupunchau chayananpata). Those divisions were named from provinces\r\n  and races of people (Provincias llamadas Anti, Cunti, Chincha y Colla)\r\n  situated to the east, west, north, and south, with reference to the\r\n  city of Cuzco, which was the centre of the empire. The four divisions\r\n  of the Inca theocracy were accordingly named Antisuyu, Cuntisuyu,\r\n  Chinchasuyu, and Collasuyu; the word _Suyu_ signifying _strip_ or\r\n  _part_. Notwithstanding the great distance between them, Quito\r\n  belonged to Chinchasuyu; and in proportion as the Incas, by their\r\n  religious wars, extended their faith, their language, and their\r\n  despotic government, these Suyus acquired greater dimensions and\r\n  became more unequal in magnitude. With the names of the provinces was\r\n  thus associated an indication of their position; and “to name those\r\n  provinces,” observes Garcilaso, “was the same as to say to the east or\r\n  to the west.” (Nombrar aquellos Partidos era lo mismo que decir al\r\n  Oriente, ó al Poniente.) The snow-chain of the Andes was regarded as\r\n  an eastern chain. “La Provincia Anti da nombra á las Montañas de los\r\n  Antis. Llamáron à la parte del Oriente Antisuyu, por la qual tambien\r\n  llaman Anti á toda aquella gran Cordillera de Sierra Nevada que pasa\r\n  al Oriente del Peru, por dar á entender, que está al Oriente.”\r\n  (_Commentarios Reales_, p. i. pp. 47, 122.)[RR] Later writers have\r\n  supposed the name of the Andes chain to be derived from the word Anta,\r\n  which, in the Quichua language, signifies copper. That metal was\r\n  indeed of the highest importance to a people who for their edged-tools\r\n  or cutting instruments, employed not iron, but a sort of copper mixed\r\n  with tin; but still the name of copper mountains would scarcely have\r\n  been extended over so vast a chain. Professor Buschmann has justly\r\n  observed, that the final “_a_” is retained in the word _anta_ when it\r\n  forms part of a compound; and Garcilaso expressly adduces as an\r\n  example _anta_, copper, and _antamarca_, province of copper. Moreover\r\n  in the ancient language of the Inca empire (the Quichua), words and\r\n  their compounds are so simple in formation that the conversion of\r\n  “_a_” into “_i_” out of the question; so that _Anta_, copper, and\r\n  _Anti_ or _Ante_ (the country or an inhabitant of the Andes or the\r\n  mountain-chain itself) must be regarded as words totally distinct from\r\n  each other. In dictionaries of the Quichua language, with explanations\r\n  in Spanish, the word _Anti_ or _Ante_ has the following\r\n  interpretations: _la tierra de los Andes_;—_el Indio, hombre de los\r\n  Andes_;—_la Sierra de los Andes_. The original signification or\r\n  derivation of the word is buried in the darkness of past ages. Besides\r\n  Antisuyu, some other compounds of which Anti or Ante forms a part,\r\n  are, Anteruna (the native inhabitant of the Andes), Anteunccuy or\r\n  Antionccoy (the sickness of the Andes; _mal de los Andes pestifero_.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  p. 390—“_The Countess de Chinchon_.”\r\n\r\n  This lady was the wife of the Viceroy Don Geronimo Fernandez de\r\n  Cabrera, Bobadilla y Mendoza, Conde de Chinchon, who governed Peru\r\n  from 1629 to 1639. The cure of the Vice-Queen took place in the year\r\n  1638. A tradition which is current in Spain, but which I have\r\n  frequently heard contradicted in Loxa, names Juan Lopez de Cañizares,\r\n  Corregidor of the Cabildo de Loxa, as the person by whom the Quina\r\n  (Cinchona) bark was first brought to Lima, and universally recommended\r\n  as a medicine. In Loxa, I have heard it affirmed that the salutary\r\n  properties of the tree were long previously, though not generally,\r\n  known in the mountainous regions. Immediately after my return to\r\n  Europe, I expressed doubts whether the discovery had really been made\r\n  by the natives in the vicinity of Loxa, for the Indians in the\r\n  neighbouring valleys, where intermittent fevers are very prevalent,\r\n  have an aversion to the Quina bark.[RS] The story which sets forth\r\n  that the natives learned the virtues of the Cinchona from the lions,\r\n  “who cure themselves of intermittent fever by gnawing the bark of the\r\n  Quina tree,”[RT] appears to be merely a monkish fiction, and wholly of\r\n  European origin. No such disease as the lion’s fever is known in the\r\n  New Continent; for the so-called great American lion (_Felis\r\n  concolor_) and the small mountain lion (the _Puma_, whose footmarks I\r\n  have seen on the snow) are never tamed, consequently never become the\r\n  subjects of observation. Nor are the various species of the feline\r\n  race, in either continent, accustomed to gnaw the bark of trees. The\r\n  name “Countess’s Powder” (_Pulvis Comitissæ_) originated in the\r\n  circumstance of the bark having been dealt out as a medicine by the\r\n  Countess de Chinchon. But this name was subsequently metamorphosed\r\n  into “Cardinal’s” or “Jesuit’s” Powder, because Cardinal de Lugo,\r\n  Procurator-General of the Order of the Jesuits, made known the\r\n  medicine, whilst he was on a journey through France, and recommended\r\n  it the more urgently to Cardinal Mazarin, as the brethren of the Order\r\n  were beginning to carry on a profitable trade in the South American\r\n  Quina bark, which they contrived to obtain through their missionaries.\r\n  It is scarcely necessary to mention that Protestant physicians\r\n  suffered themselves sometimes to be influenced by religious\r\n  intolerance and hatred of the Jesuits, in the long controversy that\r\n  was maintained, respecting the good or evil effects of the fever bark.\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  p. 393—“_Aposentos de Mulalo_.”\r\n\r\n  The Aposentos are dwellings or inns. They are called in the Quichua\r\n  language _Tampu_, whence the Spanish term _Tambo_ (an inn). On the\r\n  subject of these Aposentos see Cieça’s _Chronica del Peru_ (cap. 41\r\n  ed. de 1544, p. 108), and my _Vues des Cordillères_ (Pl. xxiv).\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:\r\n\r\n  p. 394—“_The fortress of the Cañar_.”\r\n\r\n  This fortress is situated near Turche, and at an elevation of about\r\n  10,640 feet.[RU] Not far distant from the Fortaleza del Cañar is\r\n  situated the celebrated ravine of the sun, called the Inti-Guaycu (in\r\n  the Quichua language _huaycco_). In this ravine there are some rocks\r\n  on which the natives imagine they see the image of the sun, and a\r\n  bench called the Inga-Chungana (Incachuncana), the Inca’s play. I made\r\n  drawings of both.

They likewise paved all the roads in the\r\n  country, so that the merchandize brought by trading vessels might be\r\n  conveniently transported from place to place.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 118:\r\n\r\n  p. 397—“_Nemterequeteba, the messenger of God_.”\r\n\r\n  Civilization in Mexico (the Aztec country of Anahuac), and in that\r\n  country which, in the Peruvian theocracy, was called the Empire of the\r\n  Sun, has so rivetted the attention of Europe, that a third point of\r\n  dawning civilization, the mountainous regions of New Granada, was long\r\n  totally lost sight of. I have already treated this subject in some\r\n  detail.[RW] The government of the Muyscas of New Granada bore some\r\n  resemblance to the constitution of Japan: the temporal ruler\r\n  corresponded with the Cubo or Seogun at Jeddo, and the spiritual ruler\r\n  was like the sacred Daïri at Meaco. The table-land of Bogota was\r\n  called by the natives of the country Bacata, _i. e._, the utmost limit\r\n  of the cultivated plains considered with reference to the mountain\r\n  wall. When Gonzalo Ximenez de Quesada advanced thither he found the\r\n  country ruled by three powers, whose relative subordination one to\r\n  another is not now clearly understood. The spiritual chief was the\r\n  electoral high priest of Iraca or Sogamoso (Sugamuxi, the place at\r\n  which Nemterequeteba is said to have disappeared), the temporal\r\n  princes were the Zake (Zaque of Hunsa or Tunja), and the Zipa of\r\n  Funza. The last-named prince seems to have been, in the feudal\r\n  constitution, originally subordinate to the Zake.\r\n\r\n  The Muyscas had a regular system of computing time, with intercalation\r\n  for the amendment of the lunar year. For money they made use of small\r\n  circular gold plates, cast, and all equal in diameter, (a circumstance\r\n  worthy of remark, as traces of coinage even among the ancient and\r\n  highly civilized Egyptians have hitherto been sought in vain). Their\r\n  temples of the Sun were built with stone columns, some vestiges of\r\n  which have recently been discovered in Leiva.[RX] The race of the\r\n  Muyscas should properly be distinguished by the denomination Chibchas;\r\n  for Muysca, in the Chibcha language, merely signifies _men_ or\r\n  _people_. The origin and the elements of civilization, introduced\r\n  among the Muyscas, were attributed to two mythical beings, Bochica and\r\n  Nemterequeteba, who are frequently confounded one with another.\r\n  Bochica was the most mythical of the two; having been in some degree\r\n  regarded as divine and even equal to the Sun. His fair companion Chia\r\n  or Huythaca occasioned, through her magical art, the submersion of the\r\n  beautiful valley of Bogota, and for that reason she was banished from\r\n  the earth by Bochica, and made to revolve round it as the moon.\r\n  Bochica struck the rocks of Tequendama, and thereby opened a passage\r\n  through which the waters flowed off in the neighbourhood of the\r\n  Giants’ Field (Campo de Gigantes), where, at the elevation of 8792\r\n  feet above the level of the sea, the bones of elephant-like Mastodons\r\n  have been discovered. It is stated by Captain Cochrane,[RY] and by Mr.\r\n  John Ranking,[RZ] that animals like the Mastodon still live in the\r\n  Andes, and that they cast their teeth. Nemterequeteba, surnamed\r\n  Chinzapogua, (_el enviado de Dios_, the envoy of God,) was regarded as\r\n  a human being. He is represented as a bearded man, who came from the\r\n  East, from Pasca, and who disappeared at Sogamoso. The foundation of\r\n  the sanctuary of Iraca is sometimes ascribed to Nemterequeteba and\r\n  sometimes to Bochica. The latter, it would appear, also bore the name\r\n  of Nemterequeteba, and, therefore, that the one should have been\r\n  confounded with the other, on such unhistoric ground, is a\r\n  circumstance easily accounted for.\r\n\r\n  My old friend Colonel Acosta, in his admirable work entitled\r\n  _Compendio de la Historia de la Nueva Granada_, endeavours to show,\r\n  through the evidence of the Quichua language, that New Granada is the\r\n  native land of the potato plant. In the _Compendio_ (p. 185), he\r\n  observes, “that as the potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) is known in Usmè\r\n  by the indigenous name _Yomi_, and not by the Peruvian name, and as it\r\n  was found by Quesada, cultivated in the province of Velez in 1537, a\r\n  period when its introduction from Chile, Peru, and Quito must have\r\n  been improbable, the plant may be regarded as indigenous to New\r\n  Granada.” It must, however, be borne in mind that the Peruvians had\r\n  invaded Quito, and made themselves completely masters of it before\r\n  1525, in which year the death of the Inca Huayna Capac occurred.\r\n  Indeed, the southern provinces of Quito fell under the dominion of\r\n  Tupac Inca Yupanqui at the close of the fifteenth century.[SA] The\r\n  history of the first introduction of the potato into Europe is,\r\n  unfortunately, involved in much obscurity, but the merit of the\r\n  introduction is still very generally supposed to be due to Sir John\r\n  Hawkins, who is said to have brought the plant from Santa Fé in the\r\n  year 1563 or 1565. But a fact, which appears to be better\r\n  authenticated, is, that the first potatoes grown in Europe were those\r\n  planted by Sir Walter Raleigh on his estate at Youghal in Ireland,\r\n  from whence they were conveyed to Lancashire. The Banana-tree\r\n  (_Musa_), which, since the arrival of the Spaniards, has been\r\n  cultivated in all the warmer parts of New Granada, is believed, by\r\n  Colonel Acosta (p. 205), to have been known only in Choco before the\r\n  Conquista. The name Cundinamarca, which by affected erudition was\r\n  applied to the young republic of New Granada in the year 1811, a name\r\n  suggestive of golden dreams (sueños dorados), would properly be\r\n  Cundirumarca, not Cunturmarca.[SB] Luis Daza, who accompanied the\r\n  small invading army commanded by the Conquistador Sebastian de\r\n  Belalcazar, who advanced from the south, mentions having heard of a\r\n  distant country, rich in gold, and inhabited by the race of the\r\n  Chicas. This country, Daza states, was called Cundirumarea, and its\r\n  prince solicited auxiliary troops from Atahuallpa in Caxamarca. The\r\n  Chichas have been confounded with the Chibchas or Muyscas of New\r\n  Granada; and by a similar mistake the name of the unknown more\r\n  southerly region has been transferred to this country.\r\n\r\nFootnote 119:\r\n\r\n  p. 400—“_Fall of the Rio de Chamaya_.”\r\n\r\n  See my _Recueil des Observ.

La Condamine was in Tomependa in June, 1743; consequently, 59\r\n  years before I visited that place, which I found, after astronomical\r\n  observations made during three consecutive nights, to be situated in\r\n  south lat. 5° 31′ 28″, and west long. 78° 34′ 55″). By my\r\n  observations, and a laborious recalculation of all those previously\r\n  made, Oltmanns has shewn that until the time of my return to France\r\n  the longitude of Quito had been erroneously determined, and that the\r\n  error made a difference of full 50½ arc-minutes.[SC] Jupiter’s\r\n  satellites, lunar distances, and occultations afford a satisfactory\r\n  accordance, and all the elements of the calculation are before the\r\n  public. The too easterly longitude which had been determined for Quito\r\n  was, by La Condamine, carried to Cuenca and the Amazon river. “Je\r\n  fis,” says La Condamine, “mon premier essai de navigation sur un\r\n  radeau (_balsa_) en descendant la rivière de Chinchipe jusqu’à\r\n  Tomependa.

J’y fis mon testament politique\r\n  en rédigeant l’extrait de mes observations les plus importantes.”[SD]\r\n\r\nFootnote 121:\r\n\r\n  p. 403—“_At the elevation of nearly 12,800 feet above the sea, we\r\n  found marine fossils_.”\r\n\r\n  See my _Essai géognostique sur le Gisement des Roches_, 1823, p. 236;\r\n  and for the first zoological determination of the fossils contained in\r\n  the cretaceous formation of the Andes chain, see Leopold de Buch,\r\n  _Pétrifications recueillies en Amérique_ par Alex. de Humboldt et\r\n  Charles Degenhardt, 1839 (in fol.), pp. 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 18, 22.\r\n  Pentland found fossil shells of the Silurian formation in Bolivia, and\r\n  on the Nevado of Antakana at the elevation of 17,480 feet.

Reales_, p. ii. p.\r\n  46.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 124:\r\n\r\n  p. 410—“_Captivity of Atahuallpa_.”\r\n\r\n  The captive Inca was, at his own desire, a short time before he was\r\n  put to death, conducted into the open air, for the purpose of seeing a\r\n  large comet, described to have been of a greenish black hue, and\r\n  nearly as thick as a man’s body; (“_una cometa verdinegra, poco menos\r\n  gruesa que el cuerpo de un hombre_,” Garcilaso, p. ii. p. 44). This\r\n  comet, which Atahuallpa saw shortly before his death, (therefore, in\r\n  July or August, 1533), he supposed to be the same comet of evil omen,\r\n  which had appeared at the death of his father Huayna Capac, and was\r\n  certainly identical with that observed by Appian.[SE] The comet was\r\n  seen by Appian, on the 21st of July, standing high in the north, near\r\n  the constellation of Perseus; and it appeared like a sword held by\r\n  Perseus, in his right hand.[SF] The year in which the Inca Huayna\r\n  Capac died, is considered by Robertson not to be satisfactorily\r\n  determined; but the investigations of Balboa and Velasco shew, that\r\n  the event must have occurred about the end of 1525. The statements of\r\n  Hevelius (_Cométographie_, p. 844), and of Pingré (vol. i. p. 485),\r\n  obtain additional confirmation from the testimony of Garcilaso. (p. i.\r\n  p. 321,) and the traditions preserved among the Amautas (“que son los\r\n  filosofos de aquella republica”). I may here add the remark, that\r\n  Oviedo is certainly incorrect in stating in the yet unpublished\r\n  continuation of his “_Historia de las Indias_,” that the name of the\r\n  Inca was not Atahuallpa, but Atabaliva. See Prescott’s _Conquest of\r\n  Peru_, vol. i. p. 498.\r\n\r\nFootnote 125:\r\n\r\n  p. 410—“_Ducados de Oro_,” (3,838,000 _golden ducats_.)\r\n\r\n  The sum mentioned in the text is that stated by Garcilaso de la\r\n  Vega.[SG] On this subject, however, Padre Blas Valera and Gomera give\r\n  different accounts.[SH] Moreover, it is difficult to ascertain the\r\n  precise value of the Ducado Castellano or Peso de Oro.[SI] The\r\n  intelligent historian, Prescott, has had the opportunity of consulting\r\n  a manuscript, bearing the promising title of “_Acta de Reparticion del\r\n  Rescate de Atahuallpa_,” (Act of assessment for the ransom of\r\n  Atahuallpa). The Peruvian booty shared by the brothers Pizarro and by\r\n  Almagro, appears to be too highly estimated by Prescott, who says it\r\n  amounted to 3,500,000_l._ sterling, but the ransom money, the\r\n  treasures of the different temples of the Sun, and of the Huertas de\r\n  Oro, were all included in that amount.[SJ]\r\n\r\nFootnote 126:\r\n\r\n  p. 412—“_The great Huayna Capac, who, for a Child of the Sun, was\r\n  somewhat disposed to free-thinking_.”\r\n\r\n  The nightly disappearance of the sun excited, in the mind of the Inca,\r\n  many philosophic doubts respecting the government of the world by that\r\n  luminary. Among the Inca’s remarks on this subject, as recorded by\r\n  Padre Bias Valera, are the following:—“Many maintain that the sun\r\n  lives and is the creator and maker of all things (_el hacedor de todas\r\n  las cosas_); but whosoever desires to do a thing completely must\r\n  continue at his task without intermission. Now many things are done\r\n  when the sun is absent, therefore, he cannot be the creator of all. It\r\n  may also be doubted whether the sun be really living, for, though\r\n  always moving round in a circle, he is never weary (_no se cansa_). If\r\n  the sun were a living thing he would, like ourselves, become weary;\r\n  and if he were free, he would, doubtless, sometimes move into parts of\r\n  the heavens in which we never see him. The sun is like an ox bound by\r\n  a rope, being obliged always to move in the same circle (_como una Res\r\n  atada que siempre hace un mismo cerco_), or like an arrow which can\r\n  only go where it is sent, and not where it may itself wish to go.”\r\n  (Garcilaso, _Comment. Reales_, p. i. lib. viii. cap. 8, p. 276.) The\r\n  Inca’s simple comparison of the circling movement of a heavenly body\r\n  to that of an ox fastened by a rope is very curious, owing to a\r\n  circumstance which may be explained here. Huayna Capac died at Quito\r\n  in 1525 (seven years prior to the invasion of the Spaniards), and his\r\n  empire was divided between Huascar and Atahuallpa. Now, in the native\r\n  language of Peru, the name Huascar signifies rope, and Atahuallpa\r\n  means a cock or a fowl. Instead of _res_ Huayna Capac probably used\r\n  the word signifying, in his native language, _animal_ generally; but,\r\n  even in Spanish, the word _res_ is not applied exclusively to oxen,\r\n  but is employed to denote cattle of all kinds. How far the Padre, with\r\n  the view of weaning the natives from the dynastic service of the Inca,\r\n  may have mingled passages from his own sermons with the heresies of\r\n  the Inca, we need not here inquire. That it was deemed very important\r\n  to keep these doubts from the knowledge of the lower classes of the\r\n  people is evident, from the very conservative policy and the state\r\n  maxims of the Inca Roca, the conqueror of the province of Charcas.\r\n  This Inca founded schools exclusively for the higher classes, and,\r\n  under heavy penalties, prohibited instruction being given to the\r\n  common people, lest it should render them presumptuous, and cause them\r\n  to disturb the State. (No es licito que enseñen á los hijos de los\r\n  Plebeios las Ciencias, porque la gente baja no se eleve y ensobervezca\r\n  y menoscabe la Republica; Garcilaso, p. i. p. 276.) Thus the theocracy\r\n  of the Incas may be said to have resembled the Slave States in the\r\n  free land of the North American Union.\r\n\r\nFootnote 127:\r\n\r\n  p. 415—“_Expected restoration of the Inca rule_.”\r\n\r\n  I have treated this subject at length in another work.[SK] Sir Walter\r\n  Raleigh had heard of an old prophecy current in Peru, which foretold\r\n  “that from Inglaterra those Ingas shoulde be againe in time to come\r\n  restored and deliuered from the seruitude of the said conquerors. I am\r\n  resolued that if there were but a small army afoote in Guiana marching\r\n  towards Manoa, the chiefe citie of Inga, he would yield her Majesty by\r\n  composition, so many hundred thousand pounds yearely, as should both\r\n  defend all enemies abroad and defray all expenses at home, and that he\r\n  woulde besides pay a garrison of 3000 or 4000 soldiers very royally to\r\n  defend him against other nations. The Inca will be brought to tribute\r\n  with great gladnes.”[SL] A restoration project, which promised to be\r\n  highly satisfactory to both parties, but, unfortunately for the\r\n  success of the scheme, the dynasty which was to be restored and which\r\n  was to pay for the restoration was wanting.\r\n\r\nFootnote 128:\r\n\r\n  p. 418—“_The adventurous expedition of Vasco Nuñez de Balboa_.”\r\n\r\n  I have, in another work, mentioned the fact that Columbus, long before\r\n  his death, full ten years prior to Balboa’s expedition, was aware of\r\n  the existence of the South Sea, and its near proximity to the eastern\r\n  coast of Veragua.[SM] Columbus was led to the knowledge of this fact,\r\n  not by theoretical speculations on the configuration of Eastern Asia,\r\n  but by positive and local information obtained from the inhabitants\r\n  themselves, information which he collected on his fourth voyage (11th\r\n  May, 1502, to the 7th November, 1504). This fourth voyage led the\r\n  Admiral from the coast of Honduras to the Puerto de Mosquitos, and\r\n  even as far as the western extremity of the Isthmus of Panama. The\r\n  natives reported (and Columbus commented on their reports in the\r\n  _Carta rarissima_ of the 7th of July, 1503), “that not far from the\r\n  Rio de Belen, the other sea (the South Sea), turns (boxa) to the\r\n  mouths of the Ganges; so that the countries of the Aurea (_i.e._, the\r\n  Chersonesus Aurea of Ptolemy) are situated, in relation to the eastern\r\n  shores of Veragua, as Tortosa (at the mouth of the Ebro) is in\r\n  relation to Fuentarabia (on the Bidassoa) in Biscay, or as Venice in\r\n  respect to Pisa.” But, although Balboa first saw the South Sea from\r\n  the heights of the Sierra de Quarequa, on the 25th of September,[SN]\r\n  it was several days later before Alonzo Martin de Don Benito, who had\r\n  discovered a passage from the mountains of Quarequa to the gulf of San\r\n  Miguel, embarked on the South Sea in a canoe.[SO]\r\n\r\n  The recent acquisition of the western coast of the New Continent by\r\n  the United States of North America, and the fame of the golden\r\n  treasures of New (now called Upper) California, have rendered the\r\n  question of forming a direct communication between the shores of the\r\n  Atlantic and the western regions, by the isthmus of Panama, more\r\n  urgent than ever. I, therefore, consider it my duty here once more to\r\n  direct attention to the fact, that the shortest route to the shores of\r\n  the Pacific, as pointed out by the natives to Alonzo Martin de Don\r\n  Benito, is in the eastern part of the Isthmus, and led to the Golfo de\r\n  San Miguel. We know that Columbus[SP] sought for a narrow pass\r\n  (estrecho de tierra firme); and in the official documents extant, of\r\n  the dates of 1505, 1507, and especially in that of 1514, mention is\r\n  made of the sought-for opening (abertura), and of the pass (passo),\r\n  which, in this district, should lead directly to the “Indian Land of\r\n  Spices.” A channel of communication between the Atlantic and the\r\n  Pacific, is a subject which has more or less occupied my attention for\r\n  the space of forty years; and in my published works, as well as in the\r\n  several memoirs which, with honourable confidence, the Free States of\r\n  Spanish America have requested me to write, I have constantly\r\n  recommended a hypsometrical survey of the Isthmus throughout its whole\r\n  length, but more especially at two points, viz., where at Darien and\r\n  what was formerly the deserted province of Biruquete, it joins the\r\n  South American Continent, and where, between Atrato and the Bay of\r\n  Cupica, on the shore of the Pacific, the mountain chain of the Isthmus\r\n  almost entirely disappears.[SQ]\r\n\r\n  In the year 1828 and 1829, General Bolivar, at my request, caused the\r\n  Isthmus between Panama and the mouth of the Rio Chagres to be\r\n  accurately levelled by Lloyd and Falmarc.[SR] Since that time, other\r\n  measurements have been executed by intelligent and experienced French\r\n  engineers, and plans have been drawn out for canals and railways with\r\n  locks and tunnels. But these measurements have invariably been made in\r\n  the meridian direction between Porto-bello and Panama, or westward\r\n  from thence, towards Chagres and Cruces. The most important points of\r\n  the eastern and south-eastern parts of the Isthmus, on both shores,\r\n  have in the meantime been overlooked. Until those parts shall be\r\n  described geographically, according to accurate (but easily obtained)\r\n  chronometrical determinations of latitude and longitude; and\r\n  hypsometrically, with reference to their superficial conformation, by\r\n  barometrical measurements and elevations, I see no reason to alter the\r\n  views I have always entertained on this subject. Accordingly, at the\r\n  present time (1849), I here repeat the opinion I have often before\r\n  expressed; viz., _that the assertion is groundless and altogether\r\n  premature_, that the Isthmus of Panama is unsuited to the formation of\r\n  an Oceanic Canal—one with fewer sluices than the Caledonian\r\n  Canal—capable of affording an unimpeded passage, at all seasons of the\r\n  year, to vessels of that class which sail between New York and\r\n  Liverpool, and between Chili and California.\r\n\r\n  According to examinations, the results of which the Directors of the\r\n  Deposito Hidrografico of Madrid have caused to be inserted in all\r\n  their maps since 1809, it appears that on the Antillean shore of the\r\n  Isthmus, the creek called the Ensenada de Mandinga, stretches so far\r\n  to the south that its distance from the Pacific shore, eastward of\r\n  Panama, appears to be only between 4 and 5 German geographical miles\r\n  (15 to an equatorial degree) or 16 to 20 English geographical miles.\r\n  On the Pacific coast also, the deep Golfo de San Miguel, into which\r\n  falls the Rio Tuyra, with its tributary the river Chuchunque\r\n  (Chucunaque), runs far into the Isthmus. The river Chuchunque too, in\r\n  the upper part of its course, runs within 16 geographical miles of the\r\n  Antillean shore of the Isthmus, westward of Cape Tiburon. For upwards\r\n  of twenty years I have been repeatedly consulted on the problem of the\r\n  Isthmus of Panama, by companies having ample pecuniary means at their\r\n  disposal; but in no instance has the simple advice I have given been\r\n  followed. Every engineer who has been scientifically educated knows\r\n  the fact that between the tropics, even without corresponding\r\n  observations, good barometrical measurements (horary variations being\r\n  taken into account) may be relied on as correct, within from 75 to 96\r\n  feet. Besides it would be easy to establish, for the space of a few\r\n  months, one on each shore, two fixed barometric stations; and\r\n  frequently to compare the portable instruments used in the preliminary\r\n  levelling with each other, and with those at the fixed stations. The\r\n  point demanding the most attentive examination is that where the range\r\n  of mountains between the Isthmus and the main continent of South\r\n  America sinks into hills. Considering the importance of this subject\r\n  to the commercial interests of the whole world, the examination should\r\n  not, as heretofore, be restricted within narrow bounds. A complete\r\n  comprehensive survey, including the whole eastern part of the\r\n  Isthmus—the results of which would be alike useful in facilitating\r\n  every possible scheme, whether of canals or railroads—can alone decide\r\n  the much discussed problem, either affirmatively or negatively. This\r\n  work will in the end be undertaken, but had my advice been adopted, it\r\n  would have been done at first.\r\n\r\nFootnote 129:\r\n\r\n  p. 418—“_Impressions excited by the accidental circumstances of\r\n  life_.”\r\n\r\n  In _Cosmos_ I have adverted to the incitements to the Study of Nature.\r\n  (Vol. ii. p. 371, Bohn’s edition.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 130:\r\n\r\n  p. 420—“_Of importance in determining the longitude of Lima_.”\r\n\r\n  At the time of my expedition the longitude of Lima, as determined by\r\n  Malaspina and marked in the maps published by the Deposito\r\n  Hidrografico de Madrid, was 5^h 16′ 53″. The transit of Mercury over\r\n  the Sun’s disc, on the 9th of November, 1802 (which I observed at\r\n  Callao, the port of Lima, from the Round Tower of the Fort of San\r\n  Felipe), gave for Callao, by the mean of the contact of both limbs,\r\n  5^h 18′ 16″ 5; by the external contact only, 5^h 18′ 18″ (79° 34′\r\n  30″). This result, obtained from the transit of Mercury, has been\r\n  confirmed by Lartigue and Duperrey; and by observations made during\r\n  Capt. Fitzroy’s expeditions of the “Adventurer” and the “Beagle.”\r\n  Lartigue fixed the longitude of Callao at 5^h 17′ 58″; Duperrey made\r\n  it 5^h 18′ 16″; and Capt. Fitzroy 5^h 18′ 15″. After having calculated\r\n  the longitudinal difference between Callao and the Convent of San Juan\r\n  de Dios at Lima, by carrying chronometers from the one place to the\r\n  other during four journeys, I found that the observations of the\r\n  transit of Mercury determined the longitude of Lima to be 5^h 17′ 51″\r\n  (79° 27′ 45″ W. from Paris, or 77° 6′ 3″ W. from Greenwich.)

We call\r\n  that matter inert, brute, and inanimate, the particles of which are\r\n  combined according to the laws of chemical affinity. On the other\r\n  hand, we call those bodies animate and organic, which, although\r\n  constantly manifesting a tendency to assume new forms, are restrained\r\n  by some internal force from relinquishing that originally assigned\r\n  them. That internal force, which dissolves the bonds of chemical\r\n  affinity, and prevents the elements of bodies from freely uniting, we\r\n  call vital. Accordingly, the most certain criterion of death is\r\n  putrescence, by which the first parts, or stamina of things, resume\r\n  their pristine state, and obey the laws of affinity.
