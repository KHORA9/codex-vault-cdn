To accurate\r\ndrawings of these skeletons an outline of the form of the entire animal\r\nwas added, according to the proportions and relations of the skin and\r\nadjacent soft parts to the superficial parts of the skeleton, as yielded\r\nby those parts in the nearest allied living animals. From such an\r\noutline of the exterior, Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins prepared at once a\r\nminiature model form in clay.\r\n\r\nThis model was rigorously tested in regard to all its proportions with\r\nthose exhibited by the bones and joints of the skeleton of the fossil\r\nanimal, and the required alterations and modifications were successively\r\nmade, after repeated examinations and comparisons, until the result\r\nproved satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to make a copy in clay of the proof model, of the\r\nnatural size of the extinct animal: the largest known fossil bone, or\r\npart, of such animal being taken as the standard according to which the\r\nproportions of the rest of the body were calculated agreeably with those\r\nof the best preserved and most perfect skeleton. The model of the full\r\nsize of the extinct animal having been thus prepared, and corrected by\r\nrenewed comparisons with the original fossil remains, a mould of it was\r\nprepared, and a cast taken from this mould, in the material of which the\r\nrestorations, now exposed to view, are composed.\r\n\r\nThere are some very rare and remarkable extinct animals of which only\r\nthe fossil skull and a few detached bones of the skeleton have been\r\ndiscovered: in most of these the restoration has been limited to the\r\nhead, as, for example, in the case of the Mosasaurus; and only in two\r\ninstances—those, viz., of the Labyrinthodon and Dicynodon—has Mr.\r\nHawkins taken upon himself the responsibility of adding the trunk to the\r\nknown characters of the head, such addition having been made to\r\nillustrate the general affinities and nature of the fossil, and the kind\r\nof limbs required to produce the impressions of the footprints, where\r\nthese have been detected and preserved in the petrified sands of the\r\nancient sea-shores trodden by these strange forms of the Reptilian\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the hair, the scales, the scutes, and other modifications\r\nof the skin, in some instances the analogy of the nearest allied living\r\nforms of animals has been the only guide; in a few instances, as in that\r\nof the Ichthyosaurus, portions of the petrified integument have been\r\nfortunately preserved, and have guided the artist most satisfactorily in\r\nthe restoration of the skin and soft parts of the fins; in the case of\r\nother reptiles, the bony plates, spines, and scutes have been discovered\r\nin a fossil state, and have been scrupulously copied in the attempt to\r\nrestore the peculiar tegumentary features of the extinct reptiles, as\r\n_e.g._ in the Hylæosaurus.\r\n\r\nIn every stage of this difficult, and by some it may be thought,\r\nperhaps, too bold, attempt to reproduce and present to human gaze and\r\ncontemplation the forms of animal life that have successively flourished\r\nduring former geological phases of time, and have passed away long ages\r\nprior to the creation of man, the writer of the following brief notice\r\nof the nature and affinities of the animals so restored feels it a duty,\r\nas it is a high gratification to him, to testify to the intelligence,\r\nzeal, and peculiar artistic skill by which his ideas and suggestions\r\nhave been realised and carried out by the talented director of the\r\nfossil department, Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins. Without the combination of\r\nscience, art, and manual skill, happily combined in that gentleman, the\r\npresent department of the Instructive Illustrations at the Crystal\r\nPalace could not have been realised.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         The Secondary Island.\r\n\r\nThe most cursory observation of the surface of the earth shows that it\r\nis composed of distinct substances, such as clay, chalk, lias,\r\nlimestone, coal, slate, sandstone, &c.; and a study of such substances,\r\ntheir relative position and contents, has led to the conviction that\r\nthese external parts of the earth have acquired their present condition\r\ngradually, under a variety of circumstances, and at successive periods,\r\nduring which many races of animated beings, distinct both from those of\r\nother periods and from those now living, have successively peopled the\r\nland and the waters; the remains of these creatures being found buried\r\nin many of the layers or masses of mineral substances, forming the crust\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Islands in the Geological Lake is to demonstrate the\r\norder of succession, or superposition, of these layers or strata, and to\r\nexhibit, restored in form and bulk, as when they lived, the most\r\nremarkable and characteristic of the extinct animals and plants of each\r\nstratum.\r\n\r\nThe series of mineral substances and strata represented in the smaller\r\nisland have been called by geologists “secondary formations,” because\r\nthey lie between an older series termed “primary,” and a newer series\r\ntermed “tertiary:” the term “formation” meaning any assemblage of rocks\r\nor layers which have some character in common, whether of origin, age,\r\nor composition.[1]\r\n\r\nFollowing the secondary formations as they descend in the earth, or\r\nsucceed each other from above downwards, and as they are shown,\r\nobliquely tilted up out of their original level position from left to\r\nright, in the Secondary Island, they consist: 1st, of the Chalk or\r\nCretaceous group; 2nd, the Wealden; 3rd, the Oolite; 4th, the Lias; and\r\n5th, the New Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE CHALK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chalk formations or “cretaceous group of beds” include strata of\r\nvarious mineral substances; but the white chalk which forms the cliffs\r\nof Dover and the adjoining coasts, and the downs and chalk quarries of\r\nthe South of England, is the chief and most characteristic formation.\r\nChalk, immense as are the masses in which it has been deposited, owes\r\nits origin to living actions; every particle of it once circulated in\r\nthe blood or vital juices of certain species of animals, or of a few\r\nplants, that lived in the seas of the secondary period of geological\r\ntime. White chalk consists of carbonate of lime, and is the result of\r\nthe decomposition chiefly of coral-animals (_Madrepores_, _Millepores_,\r\n_Flustra_, _Cellepora_, &c.), of sea-urchins (_Echini_), and of\r\nshell-fishes (_Testacea_), and of the mechanical reduction, pounding,\r\nand grinding of their shells. Such chalk-forming beings still exist, and\r\ncontinue their operations in various parts of the ocean, especially in\r\nthe construction of coral reefs and islands.\r\n\r\nEvery river that traverses a limestone district carries into the sea a\r\ncertain proportion of caustic lime in solution: the ill effects of the\r\naccumulation of this mineral are neutralised by the power allotted to\r\nthe above-cited sea-animals to absorb the lime, combine it with\r\ncarbonic-acid, and precipitate or deposit it in the condition of\r\ninsoluble chalk, or carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nThe entire cretaceous series includes from above downwards:\r\n\r\n  Maestricht beds of yellowish chalk.\r\n  Upper white chalk with flints.\r\n  Lower white chalk without flints.\r\n  Upper green-sand.\r\n  Gault.\r\n  Lower green-sand and Kentish rag.\r\n\r\nThe best known and most characteristic large extinct animal of the chalk\r\nformations is chiefly found in the uppermost and most recent division,\r\nand is called\r\n\r\n\r\n                         No. 1.—The Mosasaurus.\r\n             (_Mosasaurus Hoffmanni_, Hoffmann’s Mosasaur.)\r\n\r\nOf this animal almost the entire skull has been discovered, but not\r\nsufficient of the rest of the skeleton to guide to a complete\r\nrestoration of the animal. The head only, therefore, is shown, of the\r\nnatural size, at the left extremity of the Secondary Island.\r\n\r\nThe first or generic name of this animal is derived from the locality,\r\nMaestricht, on the river Meuse (Lat. _Mosa_), in Germany, where its\r\nremains have been chiefly discovered, and from the Greek word _sauros_,\r\na lizard, to which tribe of animals it belongs. Its second name refers\r\nto its discoverer, Dr. Hoffmann, of Maestricht, surgeon to the forces\r\nquartered in that town in 1780. This gentleman had occupied his leisure\r\nby the collection of the fossils from the quarries which were then\r\nworked to a great extent at Maestricht for a kind of yellowish stone of\r\na chalky nature, and belonging to the most recent of the secondary class\r\nof formations in geology. In one of the great subterraneous quarries or\r\ngalleries, about five hundred paces from the entrance, and ninety feet\r\nbelow the surface, the quarrymen exposed part of the skull of the\r\nMosasaurus, in a block of stone which they were engaged in detaching. On\r\nthis discovery they suspended their work, and went to inform Dr.\r\nHoffmann, who, on arriving at the spot, directed the operations of the\r\nmen, so that they worked out the block without injury to the fossil; and\r\nthe doctor then, with his own hands, cleared away the matrix and exposed\r\nthe jaws and teeth, casts of which are shown in the cretaceous rock of\r\nthe Island.\r\n\r\nThis fine specimen, which Hoffmann had added with so much pains and care\r\nto his collection, soon, however, became a source of chagrin to him. One\r\nof the canons of the cathedral at Maestricht, who owned the surface of\r\nthe soil beneath which was the quarry whence the fossil had been\r\nobtained, when the fame of the specimen reached him, pleaded certain\r\nfeudal rights to it. Hoffmann resisted, and the canon went to law. The\r\nChapter supported the canon, and the decree ultimately went against the\r\npoor surgeon, who lost both his specimen and his money—being made to pay\r\nthe costs of the action. The canon did not, however, long enjoy\r\npossession of the unique specimen. When the French army bombarded\r\nMaestricht in 1795, directions were given to spare the suburb in which\r\nthe famous fossil was known to be preserved; and after the capitulation\r\nof the town it was seized and borne off in triumph. The specimen has\r\nsince remained in the museum of the Garden of Plants at Paris.\r\n\r\nThis skull of the Mosasaurus measures four and a half feet long and two\r\nand a half feet wide. The large pointed teeth on the jaws are very\r\nconspicuous; but, in addition to these, the gigantic reptile had teeth\r\non a bone of the roof of the mouth (the pterygoid), like some of the\r\nmodern lizards. The entire length of the animal has been estimated at\r\nabout thirty feet. It is conjectured to have been able to swim well, and\r\nto have frequented the sea in quest of prey: its dentition shows its\r\npredatory and carnivorous character, and its remains have hitherto been\r\nmet with exclusively in the chalk formations. Besides the specimens from\r\nSt. Peter’s Mount, Maestricht, of which the above-described skull is the\r\nmost remarkable, fossil bones and teeth of the Mosasaurus have been\r\nfound in the chalk of Kent, and in the green-sand—a member of the\r\ncretaceous series—in New Jersey, United States of America. No animal\r\nlike the Mosasaurus is now known to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Nos. 2 & 3.—The Pterodactyle.\r\n\r\nNos. 2 and 3 are restorations of a flying reptile or dragon, called\r\nPterodactyle, from the Greek words _pteron_, a wing, and _dactylos_, a\r\nfinger; because the wings are mainly supported by the outer finger,\r\nenormously lengthened and of proportionate strength, which,\r\nnevertheless, answers to the little finger of the human hand. The wings\r\nconsisted of folds of skin, like the leather wings of the bat; and the\r\nPterodactyles were covered with scales, not with feathers: the head,\r\nthough somewhat resembling in shape that of a bird, and supported on a\r\nlong and slender neck, was provided with long jaws, armed with teeth;\r\nand altogether the structure of these extinct members of the reptilian\r\nclass is such as to rank them amongst the most extraordinary of all the\r\ncreatures yet discovered in the ruins of the ancient earth.\r\n\r\nRemains of the Pterodactyle were first discovered, in 1784, by Prof.\r\nCollini, in the lithographic slate of Aichstadt, in Germany, which slate\r\nis a member of the oolitic formations: the species so discovered was at\r\nfirst mistaken for a bird, and afterwards supposed to be a large kind of\r\nbat, but had its true reptilian nature demonstrated by Baron Cuvier, by\r\nwhom it was called the _Pterodactylus longirostris_, or Long-beaked\r\nPterodactyle: it was about the size of a curlew.\r\n\r\nA somewhat larger species—the _Pterodactylus macronyx_, or Long-clawed\r\nPterodactyle—was subsequently discovered by the Rev. Dr. Buckland, in\r\nthe lias formation of Lyme Regis: its wings, when expanded, must have\r\nbeen about four feet from tip to tip. The smallest known species—the\r\n_Pterodactylus brevirostris_, or Short-beaked Pterodactyle—was\r\ndiscovered in the lithographic slate at Solenhofen, Germany, and has\r\nbeen described by Professor Soemmering.\r\n\r\nRemains of the largest known kinds of Pterodactyle have been discovered\r\nmore recently in chalk-pits, at Burham, in Kent. The skull of one of\r\nthese species—the _Pterodactylus Cuvieri_—was about twenty inches in\r\nlength, and the animal was upborne on an expanse of wing of probably not\r\nless than eighteen feet from tip to tip. The restored specimen of this\r\nspecies is numbered 3.\r\n\r\nA second very large kind of Pterodactyle—the _Pterodactylus\r\ncompressirostris_, or Thin-beaked Pterodactyle—had a head from fourteen\r\nto sixteen inches in length, and an expanse of wing, from tip to tip, of\r\nfifteen feet. The remains of this species have also been found in the\r\nchalk of Kent. From the same formation and locality a third large kind\r\nof Pterodactyle, although inferior in size to the two foregoing, has\r\nbeen discovered, called the _Pterodactylus conirostris_, and also—until\r\nthe foregoing larger kinds were discovered—_Pterodactylus giganteus_.\r\nThe long, sharp, conical teeth in the jaws of the Pterodactyles indicate\r\nthem to have preyed upon other living animals; their eyes were large, as\r\nif to enable them to fly by night. From their wings projected fingers,\r\nterminated by long curved claws, and forming a powerful paw, wherewith\r\nthe animal was enabled to creep and climb, or suspend itself from trees.\r\nIt is probable, also, that the Pterodactyles had the power of swimming;\r\nsome kinds, _e.g._, the _Pterodactylus Gemmingi_, had a long and stiff\r\ntail. “Thus,” writes Dr. Buckland, “like Milton’s Fiend, all qualified\r\nfor all services and all elements, the creature was a fit companion for\r\nthe kindred reptiles that swarmed in the seas, or crawled on the shores\r\nof a turbulent planet.\r\n\r\n                      ‘The Fiend,\r\n  O’er bog, or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,\r\n  With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,\r\n  And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.’\r\n                                              _Paradise Lost_, Book II.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE WEALDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wealden is a mass of petrified clay, sand, and sandstone, deposited\r\nfrom the fresh or brackish water of probably some great estuary, and\r\nextending over parts of the counties of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex. This\r\nfresh-water formation derives its name from the “Weald” or “Wold” of\r\nKent, where it was first geologically studied, and where it is exposed\r\nby the removal of the chalk, which covers or overlies it, in other parts\r\nof the South of England.\r\n\r\nThe Wealden is divided into three groups of strata, which succeed each\r\nother in the following descending order:—\r\n\r\n1st. Weald Clay, sometimes including thin beds of sand and shelly\r\nlimestone, forming beds of from 140 to 280 feet in depth or vertical\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n2nd. Hastings Sand, in which occur some clays and calcareous grits,\r\nforming beds of from 400 to 500 feet in depth.\r\n\r\n3rd. Purbeck Beds, so called from being exposed chiefly in the Isle of\r\nPurbeck, off the coast of Dorsetshire, where it forms the quarries of\r\nthe limestone for which Purbeck is famous: the beds of limestones and\r\nmarls are from 150 to 200 feet in depth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Nos. 4 & 5.—The Iguanodon.\r\n                   (_Iguanodon Mantelli_, Conybeare.)\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, in the spring of 1822, an accomplished lady, the wife of\r\na medical practitioner, at Lewes, in Sussex, walking along the\r\npicturesque paths of Tilgate Forest, discovered some objects in the\r\ncoarse conglomerate rock of the quarries of that locality, which, from\r\ntheir peculiar form and substance, she thought would be interesting to\r\nher husband, whose attention had been directed, during his professional\r\ndrives, to the geology and fossils of his neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe lady was Mrs. Mantell: her husband, the subsequently distinguished\r\ngeologist, Dr. Mantell,[2] perceived that the fossils discovered by his\r\nwife were teeth, and teeth of a large and unknown animal.\r\n\r\n“As these teeth,” writes the doctor, “were distinct from any that had\r\npreviously come under my notice, I felt anxious to submit them to the\r\nexamination of persons whose knowledge and means of observation were\r\nmore extensive than my own. I therefore transmitted specimens to some of\r\nthe most eminent naturalists in this country and on the continent. But\r\nalthough my communications were acknowledged with that candour and\r\nliberality which constantly characterise the intercourse of scientific\r\nmen, yet no light was thrown upon the subject, except by the illustrious\r\nBaron Cuvier, whose opinions will best appear by the following extract\r\nfrom the correspondence with which he honoured me:—\r\n\r\n“‘These teeth are certainly unknown to me; they are not from a\r\ncarnivorous animal, and yet I believe that they belong, from their\r\nslight degree of complexity, the notching of their margins, and the thin\r\ncoat of enamel that covers them, to the order of reptiles.\r\n\r\n“‘May we not here have a new animal!—a herbivorous reptile? And, just as\r\nat the present time with regard to mammals (land-quadrupeds with warm\r\nblood), it is amongst the herbivorous that we find the largest species,\r\nso also with the reptiles at the remote period when they were the sole\r\nterrestrial animals, might not the largest amongst them have been\r\nnourished by vegetables?\r\n\r\n“‘Some of the great bones which you possess may belong to this animal,\r\nwhich, up to the present time, is unique in its kind. Time will confirm\r\nor confute this idea, since it is impossible but that one day a part of\r\nthe skeleton, united to portions of jaws with the teeth, will be\r\ndiscovered.’”\r\n\r\n“These remarks,” Dr. Mantell proceeds to say, “induced me to pursue my\r\ninvestigations with increased assiduity, but hitherto they have not been\r\nattended with the desired success, no connected portion of the skeleton\r\nhaving been discovered. Among the specimens lately connected, some,\r\nhowever, were so perfect, that I resolved to avail myself of the\r\nobliging offer of Mr. Clift (to whose kindness and liberality I hold\r\nmyself particularly indebted), to assist me in comparing the fossil\r\nteeth with those of the recent Lacertæ in the Museum of the Royal\r\nCollege of Surgeons. The result of this examination proved highly\r\nsatisfactory, for in an Iguana which Mr. Stutchbury had prepared to\r\npresent to the College, we discovered teeth possessing the form and\r\nstructure of the fossil specimens.” (Phil. Trans., 1825, p. 180.) And he\r\nafterwards adds:—“The name Iguanodon, derived from the form of the\r\nteeth, (and which I have adopted at the suggestion of the Rev. W.\r\nConybeare,) will not, it is presumed, be deemed objectionable.” (Ib. p.\r\n184.)\r\n\r\nThe further discovery which Baron Cuvier’s prophetic glance saw buried\r\nin the womb of time, and the birth of which verified his conjecture that\r\nsome of the great bones collected by Dr. Mantell belonged to the same\r\nanimal as the teeth, was made by Mr. W. H. Bensted, of Maidstone, the\r\nproprietor of a stone-quarry of the Shanklin-sand formation, in the\r\nclose vicinity of that town. This gentleman had his attention one day,\r\nin May, 1834, called by his workmen to what they supposed to be\r\npetrified wood in some pieces of stone which they had been blasting. He\r\nperceived that what they supposed to be wood was fossil bone, and with a\r\nzeal and care which have always characterised his endeavours to secure\r\nfor science any evidence of fossil remains in his quarry, he immediately\r\nresorted to the spot. He found that the bore or blast by which these\r\nremains were brought to light, had been inserted into the centre of the\r\nspecimen, so that the mass of stone containing it had been shattered\r\ninto many pieces, some of which were blown into the adjoining fields.\r\nAll these pieces he had carefully collected, and proceeding with equal\r\nardour and success to the removal of the matrix from the fossils, he\r\nsucceeded after a month’s labour in exposing them to view, and in\r\nfitting the fragments to their proper places.\r\n\r\nThis specimen is now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nMany other specimens of detached bones, including vertebræ or parts of\r\nthe back-bone, especially that part resting on the hind limbs, and\r\ncalled the “pelvis,” bones of the limbs, down to those that supported\r\nthe claws, together with jaws and teeth, which have since been\r\nsuccessively discovered, have enabled anatomists to reconstruct the\r\nextinct Iguanodon, and have proved it to have been a herbivorous\r\nreptile, of colossal dimensions, analogous to the diminutive Iguana in\r\nthe form of its teeth, but belonging to a distinct and higher order of\r\nreptiles, more akin to the crocodiles. The same rich materials,\r\nselecting the largest of the bones as a standard, have served for the\r\npresent restorations (Nos. 4 and 5) of the animal, as when alive: all\r\nthe parts being kept in just proportion to the standard bones, and the\r\nwhole being thus brought to the following dimensions:—\r\n\r\n  Total length, from the nose or muzzle      34  feet     9  inches.\r\n      to the end of the tail\r\n  Greatest girth of the trunk                20   ”       5     ”\r\n  Length of the head                          3   ”       6     ”\r\n  Length of the tail                         15   ”       6     ”\r\n\r\nThe character of the scales is conjectural, and the horn more than\r\ndoubtful, though attributed to the Iguanodon by Dr. Mantell and most\r\ngeologists.\r\n\r\nThis animal probably lived near estuaries and rivers, and may have\r\nderived its food from the _Clathrariæ_, _Zamiæ_, _Cycades_, and other\r\nextinct trees, of which the fossil remains abound in the same formations\r\nas those yielding the bones and teeth of the Iguanodon.\r\n\r\nThese formations are the Wealden and the Neocomian or green-sand: the\r\nlocalities in which the remains of the Iguanodon have been principally\r\nfound, are the Weald of Kent and Sussex: Horsham, in Sussex; Maidstone,\r\nin Kent; and the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\nRestorations of the _Cycas_ and _Zamia_ are placed, with the Iguanodon,\r\non the Wealden division of the Secondary Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n            No. 6.—The Hylæosaurus. (_Hylæosaurus Owenii._)\r\n\r\nThe animal, so called by its discoverer, Dr. Mantell, belongs to the\r\nsame highly organised order of the class of reptiles as the Iguanodon,\r\nthat, viz., which was characterised by a longer and stronger sacrum and\r\npelvis, and by larger limbs than the reptiles of the present day\r\npossess; they were accordingly better fitted for progression on dry\r\nland, and probably carried their body higher and more freely above the\r\nsurface of the ground.\r\n\r\nVisiting, in the summer of 1832, a quarry in Tilgate Forest, Dr. Mantell\r\nhad his attention attracted to some fragments of a large mass of stone,\r\nwhich had recently been broken up, and which exhibited traces of\r\nnumerous pieces of bone. The portions of the rock, which admitted of\r\nbeing restored together, were cemented, and then the rock was chiselled\r\nfrom the fossil bones, which consisted of part of the back-bone or\r\nvertebral column, some ribs, the shoulder bones called scapula and\r\ncoracoid, and numerous long angular bones or spines which seemed to have\r\nsupported a lofty serrated or jagged crest, extended along the middle of\r\nthe back, as in some of the small existing lizards, _e.g._, the Iguana:\r\ncut No. 6. Many small dermal bones were also found, which indicate the\r\nHylæosaurus to have been covered by hard tuberculate scales, like those\r\nof some of the Australian lizards, called _Cyclodus_.\r\n\r\nThis character of the skin, and the serrated crest, are accurately given\r\nin the restoration, the major part of which, however, is necessarily at\r\npresent conjectural, and carried out according to the general analogies\r\nof the saurian form. The size is indicated with more certainty according\r\nto the proportions of the known vertebræ and other bones.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: No. 6. Diagram of the Slab containing the Bones of\r\n    Hylæosaurus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE OOLITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe division of the secondary formations, called “Oolite,” takes its\r\nname from the most characteristic of its constituents, which is a\r\nvariety of limestone composed of numerous small grains, resembling the\r\n“roe” or eggs of a fish, whence the term, (from the Greek _oon_, an egg,\r\n_lithos_, a stone). The oolite, however, includes a great series of beds\r\nof marine origin, which, with an average breadth of thirty miles, extend\r\nacross England, from Yorkshire in the north-east to Dorsetshire in the\r\nsouth-west.\r\n\r\nThe oolite series lies below the Wealden, and where this is wanting,\r\nbelow the chalk, and consists of the following subdivisions, succeeding\r\neach other in the descending order:—\r\n\r\n                       Oolite.\r\n\r\n  Upper.    Portland stone and sand.\r\n            Kimmeridge clay.\r\n\r\n  Middle.   Coral rag.\r\n            Oxford clay.\r\n\r\n  Lower.    Cornbrash and forest marble.\r\n            Great oolite and Stonesfield slate.\r\n            Fuller’s earth.\r\n            Inferior oolite.\r\n\r\nUpon the portion of the island representing the oolite series, the most\r\nconspicuous of the restored animals of that period is—\r\n\r\n\r\n                        No. 7.—The Megalosaurus.\r\n\r\nThe Megalosaurus, as its name implies (compounded by its discoverer, Dr.\r\nBuckland, from the Greek _megas_, great, and _sauros_, lizard), was a\r\nlizard-like reptile of great size, “of which,” writes Dr. Buckland,\r\n“although no skeleton has yet been found entire, so many perfect bones\r\nand teeth have been discovered in the same quarries, that we are nearly\r\nas well acquainted with the form and dimensions of the limbs as if they\r\nhad been found together in a single block of stone.”\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the animal has been accordingly effected, agreeably\r\nwith the proportions of the known parts of the skeleton, and in harmony\r\nwith the general characters of the order of reptiles to which the\r\nMegalosaurus belonged. This order—the Dinosauria (Gr. _deinos_, terribly\r\ngreat _sauros_, a lizard)—is that to which the two foregoing huge\r\nreptiles of the Wealden series belong, viz., the Iguanodon and\r\nHylæosaurus, and is characterised by the modifications already\r\nmentioned, that fitted them for more efficient progression upon dry\r\nland. The Iguanodon represented the herbivorous section of the order,\r\nthe Hylæosaurus appears, from its teeth, to have been a mixed feeder,\r\nbut the Megalosaurus was decidedly carnivorous, and, probably, waged a\r\ndeadly war against its less destructively endowed congeners and\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: No. 7. Megalosaurus.]\r\n\r\nBaron Cuvier estimated the Megalosaurus to have been about fifty feet in\r\nlength; my own calculations, founded on more complete evidence than had\r\nbeen at the Baron’s command, reduce its size to about thirty-five\r\nfeet:[3] but with the superior proportional height and capacity of\r\ntrunk, as contrasted with the largest existing crocodiles, even that\r\nlength gives a most formidable character to this extinct predatory\r\nreptile.\r\n\r\nAs the thigh-bone (_femur_) and leg-bone (_tibia_) measure each nearly\r\nthree feet, the entire hind-leg, allowing for the cartilages of the\r\njoints, must have attained a length of two yards: a bone of the foot\r\n(metatarsal) thirteen inches long, indicates that part, with the toes\r\nand claws entire, to have been at least three feet in length. The form\r\nof the teeth shows the Megalosaurus to have been strictly carnivorous,\r\nand viewed as instruments for providing food for so enormous a reptile,\r\nthe teeth were fearfully fitted to the destructive office for which they\r\nwere designed. They have compressed conical sharp-pointed crowns, with\r\ncutting and finely serrated anterior and posterior edges; they appear\r\nstraight, as seen when they had just protruded from the socket, but\r\nbecome bent slightly backwards in the progress of growth, and the fore\r\npart of the crown, below the summit, becomes thick and convex.\r\n\r\nA minute and interesting description of these teeth will be found in Dr.\r\nBuckland’s admirable “Bridgewater Treatise” (vol. i. p. 238), from which\r\nhe concludes that the teeth of the Megalosaurus present “a combination\r\nof contrivances analogous to those which human ingenuity has adopted in\r\nthe construction of the knife, the sabre, and the saw.” The fossils\r\nwhich brought to light the former existence of this most formidable\r\nreptile, were discovered in 1823, in the oolitic slate of Stonesfield,\r\nnear Oxford, and were described by Dr. Buckland, in the volume of the\r\n“Geological Transactions” for the year 1824.\r\n\r\nRemains of the Megalosaurus have since been discovered in the “Bath\r\noolite,” which is immediately below the Stonesfield slate, and in the\r\n“Cornbrash,” which lies above it. Vertebræ, teeth, and some bones of the\r\nextremities have been discovered in the Wealden of Tilgate Forest, Kent,\r\nand in the ferruginous sand, of the same age, near Cuckfield, in Sussex.\r\nRemains of the Megalosaurus also occur in the Purbeck limestone at\r\nSwanage Bay, and in the oolite in the neighbourhood of Malton, in\r\nYorkshire.\r\n\r\nMr. Waterhouse Hawkins’s restoration, according to the proportions\r\ncalculated from the largest portions of fossil bones of the Megalosaurus\r\nhitherto obtained, yields a total length of the animal, from the muzzle\r\nto the end of the tail, of thirty-seven feet; the length of the head\r\nbeing five feet, the length of the tail fifteen feet; and the greatest\r\ngirth of the body twenty-two feet six inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Nos. 8 & 9.—Pterodactyles of the Oolite.\r\n\r\nTo the right of the Hylæosaurus, on the rock representing the greater\r\noolite formation, are restorations of species of Pterodactyle\r\n(_Pterodactylus Bucklandi_, No. 9), smaller than and distinct from those\r\nof the chalk formations. The remains of Buckland’s Pterodactyle are\r\nfound pretty abundantly in the oolitic slate of Stonesfield, near\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Nos. 10 & 11.—Teleosaurus.\r\n\r\nOn the shore beneath the overhanging cliff of oolitic rock are two\r\nrestorations, Nos. 10 and 11, of a large extinct kind of crocodile, to\r\nwhich the long and slender-jawed crocodile of the Ganges, called\r\n“Gaviàl” or “Gharriàl” by the Hindoos, offers the nearest resemblance at\r\nthe present day. Remains of the ancient extinct British gavials have\r\nbeen found in most of the localities where the oolitic formations occur,\r\nand very abundantly in the lias cliffs near Whitby, in Yorkshire. The\r\nname Teleosaurus (_telos_, the end, _sauros_, a lizard), was compounded\r\nfrom the Greek by Professor Geoffroy St. Hilaire, for a species of these\r\nfossil gavials, found by him in the oolite stone at Caen, in Normandy,\r\nand has reference to his belief that they formed one—the\r\nearliest—extreme of the crocodilian series, as this series has been\r\nsuccessively developed in the course of time on our planet.\r\n\r\nThe jaws are armed with numerous long, slender, sharp-pointed, slightly\r\ncurved teeth, indicating that they preyed on fishes, and the young or\r\nweaker individuals of co-existing reptiles. The nostril is situated more\r\nat the end of the upper jaw than in the modern gavial: the fore-limbs\r\nare shorter, and the hind ones longer and stronger than in the gavial,\r\nwhich indicates that the Teleosaur was a better swimmer; the vertebræ or\r\nbones of the back are united by slightly concave surfaces, not\r\ninterlocked by cup and ball joints as in the modern crocodiles, whence\r\nit would seem that the Teleosaur lived more habitually in the water, and\r\nless seldom moved on dry land; and, as its fossil remains have been\r\nhitherto found only in the sedimentary deposits from the sea, it may be\r\ninferred that it was more strictly marine than the crocodile of the\r\nGanges.\r\n\r\nThe first specimen of a Teleosaur that was brought to light was from the\r\n“alum-schale” which forms one layer of the lofty lias cliffs of the\r\nYorkshire coast, near Whitby. A brief description, and figures, of this\r\nincomplete fossil skeleton were published by Messrs. Wooller and\r\nChapman, in separate communications, in the 50th volume of the\r\n“Philosophical Transactions,” in 1758. Captain Chapman observes, “it\r\nseems to have been an alligator;” and Mr. Wooller thought “it resembled\r\nin every respect the Gangetic gavial.” Thus, nearly a century ago, the\r\ntrue nature of the fossil was almost rightly understood, and various\r\nwere the theories then broached to account for the occurrence of a\r\nsupposed Gangetic reptile in a petrified state in the cliffs of\r\nYorkshire. It has required the subsequent progress of comparative\r\nanatomy to determine, as by the characters above defined, the essential\r\ndistinction of the Teleosaur from all known existing forms of\r\ncrocodilian reptiles.\r\n\r\nVery abundant remains, and several species, of the extinct genus have\r\nbeen subsequently discovered: but always in the oolitic and liassic\r\nformations of the secondary series of rocks.\r\n\r\nThe oolitic group of rocks are very rich in remains of both plants and\r\nanimals: many reptiles of genera and species distinct from those here\r\nrestored have been recognised and determined by portions of the\r\nskeleton. Extremely numerous are the remains of fishes, chiefly of an\r\nalmost extinct order (_Ganoidei_), characterised by hard, shining,\r\nenamelled scales. But the most remarkable fossils are those which\r\nindisputably prove the existence, during the period of the “Great” or\r\n“Lower Oolite,” of insectivorous and marsupial mammalia—_i.e._, of\r\nwarm-blood quadrupeds, which, like the shrew or hedgehog, fed on\r\ninsects, and, like the opossum, had a pouch for the transport of the\r\nyoung. The lower jaw of one of these earliest known examples of the\r\nmammalian class, found in the Stonesfield slate, near Oxford, may be\r\nseen at the British Museum, to which it was presented by J. W. Broderip,\r\nEsq., F.R.S., by whom it was described in the “Zoological Journal,” vol.\r\niii., p. 408.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe that the marsupial genera, to which the\r\nabove fossil quadruped, called _Phascolotherium_, was most nearly\r\nallied, are now confined to New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land; since\r\nit is in the Australian seas that is found the _Cestracion_, a\r\ncartilaginous fish which has teeth that are most like those fossil teeth\r\ncalled _Acrodus_ and _Psammodus_, so common in the oolite. In the same\r\nAustralian seas, also, near the shore, the beautiful shell-fish called\r\n_Trigonia_ is found living, of which genus many fossil species occur in\r\nthe Stonesfield slate. Moreover, the Araucarian pines are now abundant,\r\ntogether with ferns, in Australia, as they were in Europe in the oolitic\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE LIAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Lias” is an English provincial name adopted in geology, and applied to\r\na formation of limestone, marl, and petrified clay, which forms the base\r\nof the oolite, or immediately underlies that division of secondary\r\nrocks. The lias has been traced throughout a great part of Europe,\r\nforming beds of a thickness varying from 500 to 1000 feet of the\r\nabove-mentioned substances, which have been gradually deposited from a\r\nsea of corresponding extent and direction. The lias abounds with marine\r\nshells of extinct species, and with remains of fishes that were clad\r\nwith large and hard shining scales. Of the higher or air-breathing\r\nanimals of that period, the most characteristic were the\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Enaliosauria.\r\n\r\nThe creatures called Enaliosauria or Sea-lizards (from the Greek\r\n_enalios_, of the sea, and _sauros_, lizard), were vertebrate animals,\r\nor had back bones, breathed the air like land quadrupeds, but were\r\ncold-blooded, or of a low temperature, like crocodiles and other\r\nreptiles. The proof that the Enaliosaurs respired atmospheric air\r\nimmediately, and did not breathe water by means of gills like fishes, is\r\nafforded by the absence of the bony framework of the gill apparatus, and\r\nby the presence, position, and structure of the air passages leading\r\nfrom the nostrils, and also by the bony mechanism of the capacious chest\r\nor thoracic-abdominal cavity: all of which characters have been\r\ndemonstrated by their fossil skeletons. With these characters the\r\nSea-lizards combined the presence of two pairs of limbs shaped like\r\nfins, and adapted for swimming.\r\n\r\nThe Enaliosauria offer two principal modifications of their anatomical,\r\nand especially their bony, structure, of which the two kinds grouped\r\ntogether under the respective names of Ichthyosaurus and Plesiosaurus\r\nare the examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The Ichthyosaurus.\r\n\r\nThe genus Ichthyosaurus includes many species: of which three of the\r\nbest known and most remarkable have been selected for restoration to\r\nillustrate this most singular of the extinct forms of animal life.\r\n\r\nThe name (from the Greek _ichthys_, a fish, and _sauros_, a lizard)\r\nindicates the closer affinity of the Ichthyosaur, as compared with the\r\nPlesiosaur, to the class of fishes. The Ichthyosaurs are remarkable for\r\nthe shortness of the neck and the equality of the width of the back of\r\nthe head with the front of the chest, impressing the observer of the\r\nfossil skeleton with a conviction that the ancient animal must have\r\nresembled the whale tribe and the fishes in the absence of any\r\nintervening constriction or “neck.”\r\n\r\nThis close approximation in the Ichthyosaurs to the form of the most\r\nstrictly aquatic back-boned (vertebrate) animals of the existing\r\ncreation is accompanied by an important modification of the surfaces\r\nforming the joints of the back-bone, each of which surfaces is hollow,\r\nleading to the inference that they were originally connected together by\r\nan elastic bag, or “capsule,” filled with fluid—a structure which\r\nprevails in the class of fishes, but not in any of the whale or porpoise\r\ntribe, nor in any, save a few of the very lowest and most fish-like, of\r\nthe existing reptiles.\r\n\r\nWith the above modifications of the head, trunk, and limbs, in relation\r\nto swimming, there co-exist corresponding modifications of the tail. The\r\nbones of this part are much more numerous than in the Plesiosaurs, and\r\nthe entire tail is consequently longer; but it does not show any of\r\nthose modifications that characterise the bony support of the tail in\r\nfishes. The numerous “caudal vertebræ” of the Ichthyosaurus gradually\r\ndecrease in size to the end of the tail, where they assume a compressed\r\nform, or are flattened from side to side, and thus the tail instead of\r\nbeing short and broad, as in fishes, is lengthened out as in crocodiles.\r\n\r\nThe very frequent occurrence of a fracture of the tail, about one fourth\r\nof the way from its extremity, in well-preserved and entire fossil\r\nskeletons, is owing to that proportion of the end of the tail having\r\nsupported a tail-fin. The only evidence which the fossil skeleton of a\r\nwhale would yield of the powerful horizontal tail-fin characteristic of\r\nthe living animal, is the depressed or horizontally flattened form of\r\nthe bones supporting such fin. It is inferred, therefore, from the\r\ncorresponding bones of the Ichthyosaurus being flattened from side to\r\nside, that it possessed a tegumentary tail-fin expanded in the vertical\r\ndirection. The shape of a fin composed of such perishable material is of\r\ncourse conjectural, but from analogies, not necessary here to further\r\nenlarge upon, it was probably like, or nearly like, that which the able\r\nartist engaged in the restoration of the entire form of the animal has\r\ngiven to it. Thus, in the construction of the principal swimming-organ\r\nof the Ichthyosaurus we may trace, as in other parts of its structure, a\r\ncombination of mammalian (beast-like), saurian (lizard-like), and\r\npiscine (fish-like) peculiarities. In its great length and gradual\r\ndiminution we perceive its saurian character; the tegumentary nature of\r\nthe fin, unsustained by bony fin-rays, bespeaks its affinity to the same\r\npart in the mammalian whales and porpoises; whilst its vertical position\r\nmakes it closely resemble the tail-fin of the fish.\r\n\r\nThe horizontality of the tail-fin of the whale tribe is essentially\r\nconnected with their necessities as warm-blooded animals breathing\r\natmospheric air; without this means of displacing a mass of water in the\r\nvertical direction, the head of the whale could not be brought with the\r\nrequired rapidity to the surface to respire; but the Ichthyosaurs, not\r\nbeing warm-blooded, or quick breathers, would not need to bring their\r\nhead to the surface so frequently, or so rapidly, as the whale; and,\r\nmoreover, a compensation for the want of horizontality of their tail-fin\r\nwas provided by the addition of a pair of hind-paddles, which are not\r\npresent in the whale tribe. The vertical fin was a more efficient organ\r\nin the rapid cleaving of the liquid element, when the Ichthyosaurs were\r\nin pursuit of their prey, or escaping from an enemy.\r\n\r\nThat the Ichthyosaurs occasionally sought the shores, crawled on the\r\nstrand, and basked in the sunshine, may be inferred from the bony\r\nstructure connected with their fore-fins, which does not exist in any\r\nporpoise, dolphin, grampus, or whale; and for want of which, chiefly,\r\nthose warm-blooded, air-breathing, marine animals are so helpless when\r\nleft high and dry on the sands: the structure in question in the\r\nIchthyosaur is a strong osseous arch, inverted and spanning across\r\nbeneath the chest from one shoulder-joint to the other; and what is most\r\nremarkable in the structure of this “scapular” arch, as it is called,\r\nis, that it closely resembles, in the number, shape, and disposition of\r\nits bones, the same part in the singular aquatic mammalian quadruped of\r\nAustralia, called _Ornithorhynchus_, _Platypus_, and Duck-mole. The\r\nIchthyosaurs, when so visiting the shore, either for sleep, or\r\nprocreation, would lie, or crawl prostrate, or with the belly resting or\r\ndragging on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary feature of the head was the enormous magnitude of\r\nthe eye; and from the quantity of light admitted by the expanded pupil\r\nit must have possessed great powers of vision, especially in the dusk.\r\nIt is not uncommon to find in front of the orbit (cavity for the eye),\r\nin fossil skulls, a circular series of petrified thin bony plates,\r\nranged round a central aperture, where the pupil of the eye was placed.\r\nThe eyes of many fishes are defended by a bony covering consisting of\r\ntwo pieces; but a compound circle of overlapping plates is now found\r\nonly in the eyes of turtles, tortoises, lizards, and birds. This curious\r\napparatus of bony plates would aid in protecting the eyeball from the\r\nwaves of the sea when the Ichthyosaurus rose to the surface, and from\r\nthe pressure of the dense element when it dived to great depths; and\r\nthey show, writes Dr. Buckland,[4] “that the enormous eye, of which they\r\nformed the front, was an optical instrument of varied and prodigious\r\npower, enabling the Ichthyosaurus to descry its prey at great or little\r\ndistances, in the obscurity of night, and in the depths of the sea.”\r\n\r\nOf no extinct reptile are the materials for a complete and exact\r\nrestoration more abundant and satisfactory than of the Ichthyosaurus;\r\nthey plainly show that its general external figure must have been that\r\nof a huge predatory abdominal fish, with a longer tail, and a smaller\r\ntail-fin: scale-less, moreover, and covered by a smooth, or finely\r\nwrinkled skin analogous to that of the whale tribe.\r\n\r\nThe mouth was wide, and the jaws long, and armed with numerous pointed\r\nteeth, indicative of a predatory and carnivorous nature in all the\r\nspecies; but these differed from one another in regard to the relative\r\nstrength of the jaws, and the relative size and length of the teeth.\r\n\r\nMasses of masticated bones and scales of extinct fishes, that lived in\r\nthe same seas and at the same period as the Ichthyosaurus, have been\r\nfound under the ribs of fossil specimens, in the situation where the\r\nstomach of the animal was placed; smaller, harder, and more digested\r\nmasses, containing also fish-bones and scales have been found, bearing\r\nthe impression of the structure of the internal surface of the intestine\r\nof the great predatory sea-lizard. These digested masses are called\r\n“coprolites.”\r\n\r\nIn tracing the evidences of creative power from the earlier to the later\r\nformations of the earth’s crust, remains of the Ichthyosaurus are first\r\nfound in the lower lias, and occur, more or less abundantly, through all\r\nthe superincumbent secondary strata up to, and inclusive of, the chalk\r\nformations. They are most numerous in the lias and oolite, and the\r\nlargest and most characteristic species have been found in these\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    No. 12.—Ichthyosaurus platyodon.\r\n\r\nThis most gigantic species, so called on account of the crown of the\r\ntooth being more flattened than in other species, and having sharp\r\nedges, as well as a sharp point, was first discovered in the lias of\r\nLyme Regis, in Dorsetshire. Fossil remains now in the British Museum,\r\nand in the museum of the Geological Society, fully bear out the\r\ndimensions exhibited by the restoration of the animal as seen basking on\r\nthe shore between the two specimens of Long-necked Plesiosaurs. The head\r\nof this species is relatively larger in proportion to the trunk, than in\r\nthe _Ichthyosaurus communis_ or _Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris_: the lower\r\njaw is remarkably massive and powerful, and projects backwards beyond\r\nthe joint, as far as it does in the crocodile. In the skull of an\r\nindividual of this species, preserved in the apartments of the\r\nGeological Society of London, the cavity for the eye, or orbit,\r\nmeasures, in its long diameter, fourteen inches. The fore and hind\r\npaddles are large and of equal size.\r\n\r\nThe lias of the valley of Lyme Regis, Dorsetshire, is the chief\r\ngrave-yard of the _Ichthyosaurus platyodon_; but its remains are pretty\r\nwidely distributed. They have been found in the lias of Glastonbury, of\r\nBristol, of Scarborough and Whitby, and of Bitton, in Gloucestershire;\r\nsome vertebræ, apparently of this species, have likewise been found in\r\nthe lias at Ohmden, in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  No. 13.—Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris.\r\n\r\nBehind the _Ichthyosaurus platyodon_, is placed the restoration of the\r\n_Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris_, or Slender-snouted Fish-lizard. The most\r\nstriking peculiarity of this species is the great length and slenderness\r\nof the jaw-bones, which, in combination with the large eye-sockets and\r\nflattened cranium, give to the entire skull a form which resembles that\r\nof a gigantic snipe or woodcock, with the bill armed with teeth. These\r\nweapons, in the present species, are relatively more numerous, smaller,\r\nand more sharply pointed than in the foregoing, and indicate that the\r\n_Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris_ preyed on a smaller kind of fish. The\r\nfore-paddles are larger than the hind ones. In the museum of the\r\nPhilosophical Institution, at Bristol, there is an almost entire\r\nskeleton of the present species which measures thirteen feet in length.\r\nIt was discovered in the lias of Lyme Regis. Portions of jaws and other\r\nparts of the skeletons of larger individuals have been found fossil in\r\nthe lias near Bristol, at Barrow-on-Soar, in Leicestershire, and at\r\nStratford-on-Avon. The _Ichthyosaurus tenuirostris_ has also left its\r\nremains in the lias formation at Boll and Amburg, in Wirtemberg,\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    No. 14.—Ichthyosaurus communis.\r\n\r\nOf this species, which was the most “common,” when first discovered in\r\n1824, but which has since been surpassed by other species in regard to\r\nthe known number of individuals, the head is restored, as protruded from\r\nthe water, to the right of the foregoing species.\r\n\r\nThe _Ichthyosaurus communis_ is characterised by its relatively large\r\nteeth, with expanded, deeply-grooved bases, and round conical furrowed\r\ncrowns; the upper jaw contains, on each side, from forty to fifty of\r\nsuch teeth. The fore-paddles are three times larger than the hind ones.\r\nWith respect to the size which it attained, the _Ichthyosaurus communis_\r\nseems only to be second to the _Ichthyosaurus platyodon_. In the museum\r\nof the Earl of Enniskillen, there is a fossil skull of the\r\n_Ichthyosaurus communis_ which measures, in length, two feet nine\r\ninches, indicating an animal of at least twenty feet in length.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Plesiosaurus.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this genus forms one of the most important additions\r\nthat geology has made to comparative anatomy. Baron Cuvier deemed “its\r\nstructure to have been the most singular, and its characters the most\r\nmonstrous, that had been yet discovered amid the ruins of a former\r\nworld.” To the head of a lizard it united the teeth of a crocodile, a\r\nneck of enormous length, resembling the body of a serpent, a trunk and\r\ntail having the proportions of an ordinary quadruped, the ribs of a\r\nchameleon, and the paddles of a whale. “Such,” writes Dr. Buckland, “are\r\nthe strange combinations of form and structure in the Plesiosaurus, a\r\ngenus, the remains of which, after interment for thousands of years\r\namidst the wreck of millions of extinct inhabitants of the ancient\r\nearth, are at length recalled to light by the researches of the\r\ngeologist, and submitted to our examination, in nearly as perfect a\r\nstate as the bones of species that are now existing upon the earth.”\r\n(Op. cit., vol. v. p. 203).\r\n\r\nThe first remains of this animal were discovered in the lias of Lyme\r\nRegis, about the year 1823, and formed the subject of the paper by the\r\nRev. Mr. Conybeare (now Dean of Llandaff), and Mr. (now Sir Henry) De la\r\nBeche, in which the genus was established and named Plesiosaurus (from\r\nthe Greek words, _plesios_ and _sauros_, signifying “near” or “allied\r\nto,” and “lizard”), because the authors saw that it was more nearly\r\nallied to the lizard than was the Ichthyosaurus from the same formation.\r\n\r\nThe entire and undisturbed skeletons of several individuals, of\r\ndifferent species, have since been discovered, fully confirming the\r\nsagacious restorations by the original discoverers of the\r\n_Plesiosaurus_. Of these species three have been selected as the\r\nsubjects of Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins’s reconstructions and representations\r\nof the living form of the strange reptiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  No. 15.—Plesiosaurus macrocephalus.\r\n\r\nThe first of these has been called, from the relatively larger size of\r\nthe head, the _Plesiosaurus macrocephalus_ (No. 15), (Gr. _macros_,\r\nlong, _cephale_, head). The entire length of the animal, as indicated by\r\nthe largest remains, and as given in the restoration, is eighteen feet,\r\nthe length of the head being two feet, that of the neck six feet; the\r\ngreatest girth of the body yields seven feet.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: No. 15. Plesiosaurus macrocephalus.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Baron Cuvier and Dr. Buckland both rightly allude to the\r\nresemblance of the fins or paddles of the Plesiosaur to those of the\r\nwhale, yet this most remarkable difference must be borne in mind, that,\r\nwhereas the whale tribe have never more than one pair of fins, the\r\nPlesiosaurs have always two pairs, answering to the fore and hind limbs\r\nof land quadrupeds; and the fore-pair of fins, corresponding to those in\r\nthe whale, differed by being more firmly articulated, through the medium\r\nof collar-bones (clavicles), and of two other very broad and strong\r\nbones (called coracoids), to the trunk (thorax), whereby they were the\r\nbetter enabled to move the animal upon dry land.\r\n\r\nRemains of the _Plesiosaurus macrocephalus_ have been discovered in the\r\nlias of Lyme Regis, in Dorsetshire, and of Weston, in Somersetshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  No. 16.—Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus.\r\n\r\nFurther to the left, on the shore of the Secondary Island, is a\r\nrestoration of the _Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus_, or Long-necked\r\nPlesiosaurus (No. 16). The head in this remarkable species is smaller,\r\nand the neck proportionally longer than in the _Plesiosaurus\r\nmacrocephalus_. The remains of the Long-necked Plesiosaur have been\r\nfound chiefly at Lyme Regis, in Dorsetshire. The well known specimen of\r\nan almost entire skeleton, formerly in the possession of His Grace the\r\nDuke of Buckingham, is now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    No. 17.—Plesiosaurus Hawkinsii.\r\n\r\nThe most perfect skeletons of the Plesiosaurus are those that have been\r\nwrought out of the lias at Street, near Glastonbury, by Mr. Thomas\r\nHawkins, F.G.S., and which have been purchased by the trustees of the\r\nBritish Museum. A restoration is given by Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins, at No.\r\n17, of a species with characters somewhat intermediate between the\r\nLarge-headed and Long-necked Plesiosaurs, and which has been called,\r\nafter its discoverer, _Plesiosaurus Hawkinsii_.\r\n\r\nThe Plesiosaurs breathed air like the existing crocodiles and the whale\r\ntribe, and appear to have lived in shallow seas and estuaries. That the\r\nLong-necked Sea-lizard was aquatic is evident from the form of its\r\npaddles; and that it was marine is almost equally so, from the remains\r\nwith which its fossils are universally associated; that it may have\r\noccasionally visited the shore, the resemblance of its extremities to\r\nthose of a turtle leads us to conjecture; its motion, however, must have\r\nbeen very awkward on land; its long neck must have impeded its progress\r\nthrough the water, presenting a striking contrast to the organisation\r\nwhich so admirably adapted the Ichthyosaurus to cut its swift course\r\nthrough the waves. “May it not, therefore, be concluded that it swam\r\nupon, or near the surface,” asks its accomplished discoverer, “arching\r\nback its long neck like a swan, and occasionally darting it down at the\r\nfish that happened to float within its reach? It may perhaps have lurked\r\nin shoal-water along the coast, concealed among the sea-weed, and,\r\nraising its nostrils to a level with the surface from a considerable\r\ndepth, may have found a secure retreat from the assaults of dangerous\r\nenemies; while the length and flexibility of its neck may have\r\ncompensated for the want of strength in its jaws, and its incapacity for\r\nswift motion through the water, by the suddenness and agility of the\r\nattack which enabled it to make on every animal fitted for its prey\r\nwhich came within its reach.”[5]\r\n\r\nFor the Secondary Island three species of the Plesiosaurus have been\r\nrestored, the _Plesiosaurus macrocephalus_, the _Plesiosaurus\r\ndolichodeirus_ (Gr. _dolichos_, long, _deire_, neck), and the\r\n_Plesiosaurus Hawkinsii_. The name “long-necked” was given to the second\r\nof these species before it was known that many other species with long\r\nand slender necks had existed in the seas of the same ancient period:\r\nthe third species is named after Mr. Thomas Hawkins, F.G.S., the\r\ngentleman by whose patience, zeal, and skill, the British Museum has\r\nbeen enriched with so many entire skeletons of these most extraordinary\r\nextinct sea-lizards.\r\n\r\nThe remains of all these species occur in the lias at Lyme Regis, and at\r\nStreet, near Glastonbury; but the _Plesiosaurus Hawkinsii_ is the most\r\nabundant in the latter locality.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: {uncaptioned}]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           NEW RED SANDSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Trias” is an arbitrary term applied in geology to the upper division of\r\na vast series of red loams, shales, and sandstones, interposed between\r\nthe lias and the coal, in the midland and western counties of England.\r\nThis series is collectively called the “New Red Sandstone formation,” to\r\ndistinguish it from the “Old Red Sandstone formation,” of similar or\r\nidentical mineral character, which lies immediately beneath the coal.\r\n\r\nThe animals which have been restored and placed on the lowest formation\r\nof the Secondary Island, are peculiar to the “triassic,” or upper\r\ndivision of the “New Red Sandstone” series, which division consists, in\r\nEngland, of saliferous (salt-including) shales and sandstones, from 1000\r\nto 1500 feet thick in Lancashire and Cheshire, answering to the\r\nformation called “Keuper-sandstone” by the German geologists; and of\r\nsandstone and quartzose conglomerate of 600 feet in thickness, answering\r\nto the German “Bunter-sandstone.”\r\n\r\nThe largest and most characteristic animals of the trias are reptiles of\r\nthe order\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Batrachia.\r\n\r\nThe name of this order is from the Greek word _batrachos_, signifying a\r\nfrog: and the order is represented in the present animal-population of\r\nEngland by a few diminutive species of frogs, toads, and newts, or\r\nwater-salamanders. But, at the period of the deposition of the new red\r\nsandstone, in the present counties of Warwick and Cheshire, the shores\r\nof the ancient sea, which were then formed by that sandy deposit, were\r\ntrodden by reptiles, having the essential bony characters of the\r\nBatrachia, but combining these with other bony characters of crocodiles\r\nand lizards; and exhibiting both under a bulk which is made manifest by\r\nthe restoration of the largest known species, (No. 16), occupying the\r\nextreme promontory of the Island, illustrative of the lowest and oldest\r\ndeposits of the secondary series of rocks. The species in question is\r\ncalled the—\r\n\r\n\r\n                 No. 18.—Labyrinthodon Salamandroides.\r\n\r\nor the Salamander-like Labyrinthodon; the latter term being from the\r\nGreek, signifying the peculiar structure of the teeth, which differ from\r\nall other reptiles in the huge Batrachia in question, by reason of the\r\ncomplex labyrinthic interblending of the different substances composing\r\nthe teeth. The skull of the Labyrinthodon is attached to the neck-bones\r\nby two joints or condyles, and the teeth are situated both on the proper\r\njaw-bones, and on the bone of the roof of the mouth called “vomer:” both\r\nthese characters are only found at the present day in the frogs and\r\nsalamanders. The hind-foot of the Labyrinthodon was also, as in the toad\r\nand frog, much larger than the fore-foot; and the innermost digit in\r\nboth was short and turned in, like a thumb.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: No. 18. Labyrinthodon Salamandroides.]\r\n\r\nConsecutive impressions of the prints of these feet have been traced for\r\nmany steps in succession (as is accurately represented in the new red\r\nsandstone part of the Secondary Island) in quarries of that formation in\r\nWarwickshire, Cheshire, and also in Lancashire, more especially at a\r\nquarry of a whitish quartzose sandstone at Storton Hill, a few miles\r\nfrom Liverpool. The foot-marks are partly concave and partly in relief;\r\nthe former are seen upon the upper surface of the sandstone slabs, but\r\nthose in relief are only upon the lower surfaces, being, in fact,\r\nnatural casts, formed on the subjacent foot-prints as in moulds. The\r\nimpressions of the hind-foot are generally eight inches in length and\r\nfive inches in width: near each large footstep, and at a regular\r\ndistance—about an inch and a half—before it, a smaller print of the\r\nfore-foot, four inches long and three inches wide, occurs. The footsteps\r\nfollow each other in pairs, each pair in the same line, at intervals of\r\nabout fourteen inches from pair to pair. The large as well as the small\r\nsteps show the thumb-like toe alternately on the right and left side,\r\neach step making a print of five toes.\r\n\r\nFoot-prints of corresponding form but of smaller size have been\r\ndiscovered in the quarry at Storton Hill, imprinted on five thin beds of\r\nclay, lying one upon another in the same quarry, and separated by beds\r\nof sandstone. From the lower surface of the sandstone layers, the solid\r\ncasts of each impression project in high relief, and afford models of\r\nthe feet, toes, and claws of the animals which trod on the clay.\r\n\r\nSimilar foot-prints were first observed in Saxony, at the village of\r\nHessberg, near Hillburghausen, in several quarries of a gray quartzose\r\nsandstone, alternating with beds of red sandstone, and of the same\r\ngeological age as the sandstones of England that had been trodden by the\r\nsame strange animal. The German geologist, who first described them,\r\nproposed the name of _Cheirotherium_ (Gr. _cheir_, the hand, _therion_,\r\nbeast), for the great unknown animal that had left the foot-prints, in\r\nconsequence of the resemblance, both of the fore and hind feet, to the\r\nimpression of a human hand, and Dr. Kaup conjectured that the animal\r\nmight be a large species of the opossum-kind. The discovery, however, of\r\nfossil skulls, jaws, teeth, and a few other bones in the sandstones\r\nexhibiting the footprints in question, has rendered it more probable\r\nthat both the footprints and the fossils are evidences of the same kind\r\nof huge extinct Batrachian reptiles.\r\n\r\nAn entire skull of the largest species discovered in the new red\r\nsandstones of Wurtemberg; a lower jaw of the same species found in the\r\nsame formation in Warwickshire; some vertebræ, and a few fragments of\r\nbones of the limbs, have served, with the indications of size and shape\r\nof the trunk of the animal yielded by the series of consecutive\r\nfoot-prints, as the basis of the restoration of the _Labyrinthodon\r\nsalamandroides_, in the Secondary Island. It is to be understood,\r\nhowever, that, with the exception of the head, the form of the animal is\r\nnecessarily more or less conjectural.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Nos. 19 & 20.—Labyrinthodon pachygnathus.\r\n\r\nThis name, signifying the Thick-jawed Labyrinthodon, was given by its\r\ndiscoverer to a species of these singular Batrachia, found in the new\r\nred sandstone of Warwickshire, and which bears to the largest species\r\nthe proportion exhibited by the head and fore-part of the body, as\r\nemerging from the water, for which parts alone the fossils hitherto\r\ndiscovered justify the restoration.[6]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Nos. 19 & 20. Section of Tooth of Labyrinthodon.\r\n    _a_ Pulp-cavity: _b b_ inflected folds of ossified capsule of\r\n    tooth.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Nos. 21 & 22.—Dicynodon.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Mr. Andrew G. Bain, who had been employed in the construction of\r\nmilitary roads in the colony of the Cape of Good Hope, discovered, in\r\nthe tract of country extending northwards from the county of Albany,\r\nabout 450 miles east of Cape Town, several nodules or lumps of a kind of\r\nsandstone, which, when broken, displayed, in most instances, evidences\r\nof fossil bones, and usually of a skull with two large projecting teeth.\r\nAccordingly, these evidences of ancient animal life in South Africa were\r\nfirst notified to English geologists by Mr. Bain under the name of\r\n“Bidentals;” and the specimens transmitted by him were submitted at his\r\nrequest to Professor Owen for examination. The results of the\r\ncomparisons thereupon instituted went to show that there had formerly\r\nexisted in South Africa, and from geological evidence, probably, in a\r\ngreat salt-water lake or inland sea, since converted into dry land, a\r\nrace of reptilian animals presenting in the construction of their skull\r\ncharacters of the crocodile, the tortoise, and the lizard, coupled with\r\nthe presence of a pair of huge sharp-pointed tusks, growing downwards,\r\none from each side of the upper jaw, like the tusks of the mammalian\r\nmorse or walrus. No other kind of teeth were developed in these singular\r\nanimals: the lower jaw was armed, as in the tortoise, by a trenchant\r\nsheath of horn. Some bones of the back, or vertebræ, by the hollowness\r\nof the co-adapted articular surfaces, indicate these reptiles to have\r\nbeen good swimmers, and probably to have habitually existed in water;\r\nbut the construction of the bony passages of the nostrils proves that\r\nthey must have come to the surface to breathe air.\r\n\r\nSome extinct plants allied to the Lepidodendron, with other fossils,\r\nrender it probable that the sandstones containing the Dicynodont\r\nreptiles were of the same geological age as those that have revealed the\r\nremains of the Labyrinthodonts in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe generic name Dicynodon is from the Greek words signifying “two tusks\r\nor canine teeth.” Three species of this genus have been demonstrated\r\nfrom the fossils transmitted by Mr. Bain.\r\n\r\nThe _Dicynodon lacerticeps_, or Lizard-headed Dicynodon, attained the\r\nbulk of a walrus; the form of the head and tusks is correctly given in\r\nthe restoration (No. 21); the trunk has been added conjecturally, to\r\nillustrate the strange combination of characters manifested in the head.\r\n\r\nA second species, with a head so formed as to have given the animal\r\nsomewhat of the physiognomy of an owl, has been partially restored at\r\nNo. 22.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: No. 8.
