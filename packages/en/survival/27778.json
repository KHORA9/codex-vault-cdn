Many facts have been learned by observation,\r\nbut the _why_ of each is frequently shrouded in mystery.\r\n\r\nModern dairying is attempting to build its more accurate knowledge upon\r\na broader and surer foundation, and in doing this is seeking to\r\nascertain the cause of well-established processes. In this, bacteriology\r\nis playing an important role. Indeed, it may be safely predicted that\r\nfuture progress in dairying will, to a large extent, depend upon\r\nbacteriological research. As Fleischmann, the eminent German dairy\r\nscientist, says: \"The gradual abolition of uncertainty surrounding dairy\r\nmanufacture is the present important duty which lies before us, and its\r\nsolution can only be effected by bacteriology.\"\r\n\r\nIt is therefore natural that the subject of Dairy Bacteriology has come\r\nto occupy an important place in the curriculum of almost every Dairy\r\nSchool. An exposition of its principles is now recognized as an integral\r\npart of dairy science, for modern dairy practice is rapidly adopting the\r\nmethods that have been developed as the result of bacteriological study.\r\nThe rapid development of the subject has necessitated a frequent\r\nrevision of this work, and it is gratifying to the writer that the\r\nattempt which has been made to keep these Outlines abreast of\r\nbacteriological advance has been appreciated by students of dairying.\r\n\r\nWhile the text is prepared more especially for the practical dairy\r\noperator who wishes to understand the principles and reasons underlying\r\nhis art, numerous references to original investigations have been added\r\nto aid the dairy investigator who wishes to work up the subject more\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\nMy acknowledgments are due to the following for the loan of\r\nillustrations: Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station; Creamery\r\nPackage Mfg.

Their\r\nplant-like nature can be more readily understood from their general\r\nstructure and habits of life. The bacteria, however, are so small, that\r\nunder ordinary conditions, they only become evident to our unaided\r\nsenses by the by-products of their activity.\r\n\r\nWhen Leeuwenhoek (pronounced Lave-en-hake) in 1675 first discovered\r\nthese tiny, rapidly-moving organisms he thought they were animals.\r\nIndeed, under a microscope, many of them bear a close resemblance to\r\nthose minute worms found in vinegar that are known as \"vinegar-eels.\"\r\nThe idea that they belonged to the animal kingdom continued to hold\r\nground until after the middle of the nineteenth century; but with the\r\nimprovement in microscopes, a more thorough study of these tiny\r\nstructures was made possible, and their vegetable nature demonstrated.\r\nThe bacteria as a class are separated from the fungi mainly by their\r\nmethod of growth; from the lower algae by the absence of chlorophyll,\r\nthe green coloring matter of vegetable organisms.\r\n\r\n~Structure of bacteria.~ So far as structure is concerned the bacteria\r\nstand on the lowest plane of vegetable life. The single individual is\r\ncomposed of but a single cell, the structure of which does not differ\r\nessentially from that of many of the higher types of plant life. It is\r\ncomposed of a protoplasmic body which is surrounded by a thin membrane\r\nthat separates it from neighboring cells that are alike in form and\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n~Form and size.~ When a plant is composed of a single cell but little\r\ndifference in form is to be expected. While there are intermediate\r\nstages that grade insensibly into each other, the bacteria may be\r\ngrouped into three main types, so far as form is concerned. These are\r\nspherical, elongated, and spiral, and to these different types are given\r\nthe names, respectively, _coccus_, _bacillus_ and _spirillum_ (plural,\r\n_cocci_, _bacilli_, _spirilla_) (fig. 1). A ball, a short rod, and a\r\ncorkscrew serve as convenient models to illustrate these different\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Different forms of bacteria. _a_, _b_, _c_,\r\nrepresent different types as to form: _a_, coccus, _b_, bacillus, _c_,\r\nspirillum; _d_, diplococcus or twin coccus; _e_, staphylococcus or\r\ncluster coccus; _f_ and _g_, different forms of bacilli, _g_ shows\r\ninternal endospores within cell; _h_ and _i_, bacilli with motile organs\r\n(cilia).]\r\n\r\nIn size, the bacteria are the smallest organisms that are known to\r\nexist. Relatively there is considerable difference in size between the\r\ndifferent species, yet in absolute amount this is so slight as to\r\nrequire the highest powers of the microscope to detect it. As an average\r\ndiameter, one thirty-thousandth of an inch may be taken. It is difficult\r\nto comprehend such minute measurements, but if a hundred individual\r\ngerms could be placed side by side, their total thickness would not\r\nequal that of a single sheet of paper upon which this page is printed.\r\n\r\n~Manner of Growth.~ As the cell increases in size as a result of growth,\r\nit elongates in one direction, and finally a new cell wall is formed,\r\ndividing the so-called mother-cell into two, equal-sized daughter-cells.\r\nThis process of cell division, known as _fission_, is continued until\r\ngrowth ceases and is especially characteristic of bacteria.\r\n\r\n~Cell Arrangement.~ If fission goes on in the same plane continually, it\r\nresults in the formation of a cell-row. A coccus forming such a chain of\r\ncells is called _strepto-coccus_ (chain-coccus). If only two cells\r\ncohere, it is called a _diplo-coccus_ (twin-coccus). If the second cell\r\ndivision plane is formed at right angles to the first, a _cell surface_\r\nor _tetrad_ is formed. If growth takes place in three dimensions of\r\nspace, a _cell mass_ or _sarcina_ is produced. Frequently, these cell\r\naggregates cohere so tenaciously that this arrangement is of value in\r\ndistinguishing different species.\r\n\r\n~Spores.~ Some bacteria possess the property of forming _spores_ within\r\nthe mother cell (called _endospores_, fig. 1g) that are analogous in\r\nfunction to the seeds of higher plants and spores of fungi. By means of\r\nthese structures which are endowed with greater powers of resistance\r\nthan the vegetating cell, the organism is able to protect itself from\r\nthe effect of an unfavorable environment. Many of the bacilli form\r\nendospores but the cocci do not. It is these spore forms that make it\r\nso difficult to thoroughly sterilize milk.\r\n\r\n~Movement.~ Many bacteria are unable to move from place to place. They\r\nhave, however, a vibrating movement known as the _Brownian_ motion that\r\nis purely physical. Many other kinds are endowed with powers of\r\nlocomotion. Motion is produced by means of fine thread-like processes of\r\nprotoplasm known as _cilia_ (sing. _cilium_) that are developed on the\r\nouter surface of the cell. By means of the rapid vibration of these\r\norgans, the cell is propelled through the medium. Nearly all cocci are\r\nimmotile, while the bacilli may or may not be. These cilia are so\r\ndelicate that it requires special treatment to demonstrate their\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n~Classification.~ In classifying or arranging the different members of any\r\ngroup of living objects, certain similarities and dissimilarities must\r\nbe considered. These are usually those that pertain to the structure and\r\nform, as such are regarded as most constant. With the bacteria these\r\ndifferences are so slight that they alone do not suffice to distinguish\r\ndistinctly one species from another. As far as these characters can be\r\nused, they are taken, but in addition, many characteristics of a\r\nphysiological nature are added. The way that the organism grows in\r\ndifferent kinds of cultures, the by-products produced in different\r\nmedia, and effect on the animal body when injected into the same are\r\nalso used as data in distinguishing one species from another.\r\n\r\n~Conditions favoring bacterial growth.~ The bacteria, in common with all\r\nother living organisms are affected by external conditions, either\r\nfavorably or unfavorably. Certain conditions must prevail before\r\ndevelopment can occur. Thus, the organism must be supplied with an\r\nadequate and suitable food supply and with moisture. The temperature\r\nmust also range between certain limits, and finally, the oxygen\r\nrequirements of the organism must be considered.\r\n\r\n~Food supply.~ Most bacteria are capable of living on dead, inert, organic\r\nmatter, such as meats, milk and vegetable material, in which case, they\r\nare known as _saprophytes_. In contradistinction to this class is a\r\nsmaller group known as _parasites_, which derive their nourishment from\r\nthe living tissues of animals or plants. The first group comprise by far\r\nthe larger number of known organisms which are concerned for the most\r\npart in the decomposition of organic matter. The parasitic group\r\nincludes those which are the cause of various communicable diseases.\r\nBetween these two groups there is no sharp line of division, and in some\r\ncases, certain species possess the faculty of growing either as\r\nparasites or saprophytes, in which case they are known as _facultative_\r\nparasites or saprophytes.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of bacteria of interest in dairying belong to the\r\nsaprophytic class; only those species capable of infecting milk through\r\nthe development of disease in the animal are parasites in the strict\r\nsense of the term. Most disease-producing species, as diphtheria or\r\ntyphoid fever, while parasitic in man lead a saprophytic method of life\r\nso far as their relation to milk is concerned.\r\n\r\nBacteria require for their growth, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon, oxygen,\r\ntogether with a limited amount of mineral matter. The nitrogen and\r\ncarbon are most available in the form of organic compounds, such as\r\nalbuminous material. Carbon in the form of carbohydrates, as sugar or\r\nstarch, is most readily attacked by bacteria.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the bacteria are plant-cells, they must imbibe their food\r\nfrom material in solution. They are capable of living on solid\r\nsubstances, but in such cases, the food elements must be rendered\r\nsoluble, before they can be appropriated. If nutritive liquids are too\r\nhighly concentrated, as in the case of syrups and condensed milk,\r\nbacteria cannot grow therein, although all the necessary ingredients may\r\nbe present. Generally, bacteria prefer a neutral or slightly alkaline\r\nmedium, rather than one of acid reaction; but there are numerous\r\nexceptions to this general rule, especially among the bacteria found in\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n~Temperature.~ Growth of bacteria can only occur within certain\r\ntemperature limits, the extremes of which are designated as the\r\n_minimum_ and _maximum_. Below and above these respective limits, life\r\nmay be retained in the cell for a time, but actual cell-multiplication\r\nis stopped. Somewhere between these two cardinal temperature points, and\r\ngenerally nearer the maximum limit is the most favorable temperature for\r\ngrowth, known as the _optimum_. The temperature zone of most dairy\r\nbacteria in which growth occurs ranges from 40 deg.-45 deg. F. to somewhat\r\nabove blood-heat, 105 deg.-110 deg. F., the optimum being from 80 deg.-95\r\ndeg. F. Many parasitic species, because of their adaptation to the bodies\r\nof warm-blooded animals, generally have a narrower range, and a higher\r\noptimum, usually approximating the blood heat (98 deg.-99 deg. F). The\r\nbroader growth limits of bacteria in comparison with other kinds of life\r\nexplain why these organisms are so widely distributed in nature.\r\n\r\n~Air supply.~ Most bacteria require as do the green plants and animal\r\nlife, the free oxygen of the air for their respiration. These are called\r\n_aerobic_. Some species, however, and some yeasts as well possess the\r\npeculiar property of taking the oxygen which they need from organic\r\ncompounds such as sugar, etc., and are therefore able to live and grow\r\nunder conditions where the atmospheric air is excluded. These are known\r\nas _anaerobic_. While some species grow strictly under one condition or\r\nthe other, and hence are _obligate_ aerobes or anaerobes, others possess\r\nthe ability of growing under either condition and are known as\r\n_facultative_ or optional forms. The great majority of milk bacteria are\r\neither obligate or facultative aerobes.\r\n\r\n~Rate of growth.~ The rate of bacterial development is naturally very much\r\naffected by external conditions, food supply and temperature exerting\r\nthe most influence. In the neighborhood of the freezing point but little\r\ngrowth occurs. The rate increases with a rise in temperature until at\r\nthe _optimum_ point, which is generally near the blood heat or slightly\r\nbelow (90 deg.-98 deg. F.), a single cell will form two cells in 20 to 30\r\nminutes. If temperature rises much above blood heat rate of growth is\r\nlessened and finally ceases. Under ideal conditions, rapidity of growth\r\nis astounding, but this initially rapid rate of development cannot be\r\nmaintained indefinitely, for growth is soon limited by the accumulation\r\nof by-products of cell activity. Thus, milk sours rapidly at ordinary\r\ntemperatures until the accumulation of acid checks its development.\r\n\r\n~Detrimental effect of external conditions.~ Environmental influences of a\r\ndetrimental character are constantly at work on bacteria, tending to\r\nrepress their development or destroy them. These act much more readily\r\non the vegetating cell than on the more resistant spore. A thorough\r\nknowledge of the effect of these antagonistic forces is essential, for\r\nit is often by their means that undesirable bacteria may be killed out.\r\n\r\n~Effect of cold.~ While it is true that chilling largely prevents\r\nfermentative action, and actual freezing stops all growth processes,\r\nstill it does not follow that exposure to low temperatures will\r\neffectually destroy the vitality of bacteria, even in the vegetative\r\ncondition. Numerous non-spore-bearing species remain alive in ice for a\r\nprolonged period, and recent experiments with liquid air show that even\r\na temperature of -310 deg. F. for hours does not effectually kill all\r\nexposed cells.\r\n\r\n~Effect of heat.~ High temperatures, on the other hand, will destroy any\r\nform of life, whether in the vegetative or latent stage. The temperature\r\nat which the vitality of the cell is lost is known as the _thermal death\r\npoint_. This limit is not only dependent upon the nature of the\r\norganism, but varies with the time of exposure and the condition in\r\nwhich the heat is applied. In a moist atmosphere the penetrating power\r\nof heat is great; consequently cell-death occurs at a lower temperature\r\nthan in a dry atmosphere. An increase in time of exposure lowers the\r\ntemperature point at which death occurs.\r\n\r\nFor vegetating forms the thermal death point of most bacteria ranges\r\nfrom 130 deg.-140 deg. F. where the exposure is made for ten minutes which\r\nis the standard arbitrarily selected. In the spore stage resistance is\r\ngreatly increased, some forms being able to withstand steam at 210\r\ndeg.-212 deg. F. from one to three hours. If dry heat is employed, 260\r\ndeg.-300 deg. F. for an hour is necessary to kill spores. Where steam is\r\nconfined under pressure, a temperature of 230 deg.-240 deg. F. for 15-20\r\nminutes suffices to kill all spores.\r\n\r\n~Drying.~ Spore-bearing bacteria like anthrax withstand drying with\r\nimpunity; even tuberculous material, although not possessing spores\r\nretains its infectious properties for many months. Most of the dairy\r\nbacteria do not produce spores, and yet in a dry condition, they retain\r\ntheir vitality unimpaired for considerable periods, if they are not\r\nsubjected to other detrimental influences.\r\n\r\n~Light.~ Bright sunlight exerts on many species a powerful disinfecting\r\naction, a few hours being sufficient to destroy all cells that are\r\nreached by the sun's rays. Even diffused light has a similar effect,\r\nalthough naturally less marked. The active rays in this disinfecting\r\naction are those of the chemical or violet end of the spectrum, and not\r\nthe heat or red rays.\r\n\r\n~Influence of chemical substances.~ A great many chemical substances exert\r\na more or less powerful toxic action of various kinds of life. Many of\r\nthese are of great service in destroying or holding bacterial growth in\r\ncheck. Those that are toxic and result in the death of the cell are\r\nknown as _disinfectants_; those that merely inhibit, or retard growth\r\nare known as _antiseptics_. All disinfectants must of necessity be\r\nantiseptic in their action, but not all antiseptics are disinfectants\r\neven when used in strong doses. Disinfectants have no place in dairy\r\nwork, except to destroy disease bacteria, or preserve milk for\r\nanalytical purposes. Corrosive sublimate or potassium bichromate are\r\nmost frequently used for these purposes. The so-called chemical\r\npreservatives used to \"keep\" milk depend for their effect on the\r\ninhibition of bacterial growth. With a substance so violently toxic as\r\nformaldehyde (known as formalin, freezene) antiseptic doses are likely\r\nto be exceeded. In this country most states prohibit the use of these\r\nsubstances in milk. Their only function in the dairy should be to check\r\nfermentative or putrefactive processes outside of milk and so keep the\r\nair free from taints.\r\n\r\n~Products of growth.~ All bacteria in their development form certain more\r\nor less characteristic by-products. With most dairy bacteria, these\r\nproducts are formed from the decomposition of the medium in which the\r\nbacteria may happen to live. Such changes are known, collectively, as\r\nfermentations, and are characterised by the production of a large amount\r\nof by-products, as a result of the development of a relatively small\r\namount of cell-life. The souring of milk, the formation of butyric acid,\r\nthe making of vinegar from cider, are all examples of fermentative\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nWith many bacteria, especially those that affect proteid matter,\r\nfoul-smelling gases are formed. These are known as putrefactive changes.\r\nAll organic matter, under the action of various organisms, sooner or\r\nlater undergoes decay, and in different stages of these processes,\r\nacids, alkalies, gases and numerous other products are formed. Many of\r\nthese changes in organic matter occur only when such material is brought\r\nin direct contact with the living bacterial cell.\r\n\r\nIn other instances, soluble, non-vital ferments known as _enzyms_ are\r\nproduced by the living cell, which are able to act on organic matter, in\r\na medium free from live cells, or under conditions where the activity of\r\nthe cell is wholly suspended. These enzyms are not confined to bacteria\r\nbut are found throughout the animal and plant world, especially in those\r\nprocesses that are concerned in digestion. Among the better known of\r\nthese non-vital ferments are rennet, the milk-curdling enzym; diastase\r\nor ptyalin of the saliva, the starch-converting enzym; pepsin and\r\ntrypsin, the digestive ferments of the animal body.\r\n\r\nEnzyms of these types are frequently found among the bacteria and yeasts\r\nand it is by virtue of this characteristic that these organisms are\r\nable to break down such enormous quantities of organic matter. Most of\r\nthese enzyms react toward heat, cold and chemical poisons in a manner\r\nquite similar to the living cells. In one respect they are readily\r\ndifferentiated, and that is, that practically all of them are capable of\r\nproducing their characteristic chemical transformations under\r\nanaesthetic conditions, as in a saturated ether or chloroform\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n~Distribution of bacteria.~ As bacteria possess greater powers of\r\nresistance than most other forms of life, they are to be found more\r\nwidely distributed than any other type. At the surface of the earth,\r\nwhere conditions permit of their growth, they are found everywhere,\r\nexcept in the healthy tissues of animals and plants. In the superficial\r\nsoil layers, they exist in myriads, as here they have abundance of\r\nnourishment. At the depth of several feet however, they diminish rapidly\r\nin numbers, and in the deeper soil layers, from six to ten feet or more,\r\nthey are not present, because of the unsuitable growth conditions.\r\n\r\nThe bacteria are found in the air because of their development in the\r\nsoil below. They are unable to grow even in a moist atmosphere, but are\r\nso readily dislodged by wind currents that over land areas the lower\r\nstrata of the air always contain them. They are more numerous in summer\r\nthan in winter; city air contains larger numbers than country air.\r\nWherever dried fecal matter is present, as in barns, the air contains\r\nmany forms.\r\n\r\nWater contains generally enough organic matter in solution, so that\r\ncertain types of bacterial life find favorable growth conditions. Water\r\nin contact with the soil surface takes up many impurities, and is of\r\nnecessity rich in microbes. As the rain water percolates into the soil,\r\nit loses its germ content, so that the normal ground water, like the\r\ndeeper soil layers, contains practically no bacterial life. Springs\r\ntherefore are relatively deficient in germ life, except as they become\r\ninfected with soil organisms, as the water issues from the soil. Water\r\nmay serve to disseminate certain infectious diseases as typhoid fever\r\nand cholera among human beings, and a number of animal maladies.\r\n\r\nWhile the inner tissues of healthy animals are free from bacteria, the\r\nnatural passages as the respiratory and digestive tracts, being in more\r\ndirect contact with the exterior, become more readily infected. This is\r\nparticularly true with reference to the intestinal tract, for in the\r\nundigested residue, bacterial activity is at a maximum. The result is\r\nthat fecal matter contains enormous numbers of organisms so that the\r\npossibility of pollution of any food medium such as milk with such\r\nmaterial is sure to introduce elements that seriously affect the quality\r\nof the product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF STUDYING BACTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Necessity of bacterial masses for study.~ The bacteria are so extremely\r\nsmall that it is impossible to study individual germs separately without\r\nthe aid of first-class microscopes. For this reason, but little advance\r\nwas made in the knowledge of these lower forms of plant life, until the\r\nintroduction of culture methods, whereby a single organism could be\r\ncultivated and the progeny of this cell increased to such an extent in a\r\nshort course of time, that they would be visible to the unaided eye.\r\n\r\nThis is done by growing the bacteria in masses on various kinds of food\r\nmedia that are prepared for the purpose, but inasmuch as bacteria are so\r\nuniversally distributed, it becomes an impossibility to cultivate any\r\nspecial form, unless the medium in which they are grown is first freed\r\nfrom all pre-existing forms of germ life. To accomplish this, it is\r\nnecessary to subject the nutrient medium to some method of\r\nsterilization, such as heat or filtration, whereby all life is\r\ncompletely destroyed or eliminated. Such material after it has been\r\nrendered germ-free is kept in sterilized glass tubes and flasks, and is\r\nprotected from infection by cotton stoppers.\r\n\r\n~Culture media.~ For culture media, many different substances are\r\nemployed. In fact, bacteria will grow on almost any organic substance\r\nwhether it is solid or fluid, provided the other essential conditions of\r\ngrowth are furnished. The food substances that are used for culture\r\npurposes are divided into two classes; solids and liquids.\r\n\r\nSolid media may be either permanently solid like potatoes, or they may\r\nretain their solid properties only at certain temperatures like gelatin\r\nor agar. The latter two are of utmost importance in bacteriological\r\nresearch, for their use, which was introduced by Koch, permits the\r\nseparation of the different forms that may happen to be in any mixture.\r\nGelatin is used advantageously because the majority of bacteria present\r\nwider differences due to growth upon this medium than upon any other. It\r\nremains solid at ordinary temperatures, becoming liquid at about 70 deg. \r\nF. Agar, a gelatinous product derived from a Japanese sea-weed, has a much\r\nhigher melting point, and can be successfully used, especially with\r\nthose organisms whose optimum growth point is above the melting point of\r\ngelatin.\r\n\r\nBesides these solid media, different liquid substances are extensively\r\nused, such as beef broth, milk, and infusions of various vegetable and\r\nanimal tissues. Skim-milk is of especial value in studying the milk\r\nbacteria and may be used in its natural condition, or a few drops of\r\nlitmus solution may be added in order to detect any change in its\r\nchemical reaction due to the bacteria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. A gelatin plate culture showing appearance of\r\ndifferent organisms in a sample of milk. Each mass represents a\r\nbacterial growth (colony) derived from a single cell. Different forms\r\nreact differently toward the gelatin, some liquefying the same, others\r\ngrowing in a restricted mass. _a_, represents a colony of the ordinary\r\nbread mold; _b_, a liquefying bacterium; _c_, and _d_, solid forms.]\r\n\r\n~Methods of isolation.~ Suppose for instance one wishes to isolate the\r\ndifferent varieties of bacteria found in milk. The method of procedure\r\nis as follows: Sterile gelatin in glass tubes is melted and cooled down\r\nso as to be barely warm. To this gelatin which is germ-free a drop of\r\nmilk is added. The gelatin is then gently shaken so as to thoroughly\r\ndistribute the milk particles, and poured out into a sterile flat glass\r\ndish and quickly covered. This is allowed to stand on a cool surface\r\nuntil the gelatin hardens. After the culture plate has been left for\r\ntwenty-four to thirty-six hours at the proper temperature, tiny spots\r\nwill begin to appear on the surface, or in the depth of the culture\r\nmedium. These patches are called _colonies_ and are composed of an\r\nalmost infinite number of individual germs, the result of the continued\r\ngrowth of a single organism that was in the drop of milk which was\r\nfirmly held in place when the gelatin solidified. The number of these\r\ncolonies represents approximately the number of germs that were present\r\nin the milk drop. If the plate is not too thickly sown with these germs,\r\nthe colonies will continue to grow and increase in size, and as they do,\r\nminute differences will begin to appear. These differences may be in the\r\ncolor, the contour and the texture of the colony, or the manner in\r\nwhich it acts toward gelatin. In order to make sure that the seeding in\r\nnot too copious so as to interfere with continued study, an\r\n_attenuation_ is usually made. This consists in taking a drop of the\r\ninfected gelatin in the first tube, and transferring it to another tube\r\nof sterile media. Usually this operation is repeated again so that these\r\nculture plates are made with different amounts of seed with the\r\nexpectation that in at least one plate the seeding will not be so thick\r\nas to prevent further study. For transferring the culture a loop made of\r\nplatinum wire is used. By passing this through a gas flame, it can be\r\nsufficiently sterilized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Profile view of gelatin plate culture; _b_, a\r\nliquefying form that dissolves the gelatin; _c_ and _d_, surface\r\ncolonies that do not liquefy the gelatin.]\r\n\r\nTo further study the peculiarities of different germs, the separate\r\ncolonies are transferred to other sterile tubes of culture material and\r\nthus _pure cultures_ of the various germs are secured. These cultures\r\nthen serve as a basis for continued study and must be planted and grown\r\nupon all the different kinds of media that are obtainable. In this way\r\nthe slight variations in the growth of different forms are detected and\r\nthe peculiar characteristics are determined, so that the student is able\r\nto recognize this form when he meets it again.\r\n\r\nThese culture methods are of essential importance in bacteriology, as it\r\nis the only way in which it is possible to secure a quantity of germs of\r\nthe same kind.\r\n\r\n~The microscope in bacterial investigation.~ In order to verify the purity\r\nof the cultures, the microscope is in constant demand throughout all the\r\ndifferent stages of the isolating process. For this purpose, it is\r\nessential that the instrument used shall be one of strong magnifying\r\npowers (600-800 diameters), combined with sharp definition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. Pure cultures of different kinds of bacteria in\r\ngelatin tubes. _a_, growth slight in this medium; _b_, growth copious at\r\nand near surface. Fine parallel filaments growing out into medium\r\nliquefying at surface; _c_, a rapid liquefying form; _d_, a\r\ngas-producing form that grows equally well in lower part of tube as at\r\nsurface (facultative anaerobe); _e_, an obligate anaerobe, that develops\r\nonly in absence of air.]\r\n\r\nThe microscopical examination of any germ is quite as essential as the\r\ndetermination of culture characteristics; in fact, the two must go hand\r\nin hand. The examination reveals not only the form and size of the\r\nindividual germs, but the manner in which they are united with each\r\nother, as well as any peculiarities of movement that they may possess.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out the microscopical part of the work, not only is the\r\norganism examined in a living condition, but preparations are made by\r\nusing solutions of anilin dyes as staining agents. These are of great\r\nservice in bringing out almost imperceptible differences. The art of\r\nstaining has been carried to the highest degree of perfection in\r\nbacteriology, especially in the detection of germs that are found in\r\ndiseased tissues in the animal or human body.\r\n\r\nIn studying the peculiarities of any special organism, not only is it\r\nnecessary that these cultural and microscopical characters should be\r\nclosely observed, but special experiments must be carried out along\r\ndifferent lines, in order to determine any special properties that the\r\ngerm may possess. Thus, the ability of any form to act as a fermentative\r\norganism can be tested by fermentation experiments; the property of\r\ncausing disease, studied by the inoculation of pure cultures into\r\nanimals. A great many different methods have been devised for the\r\npurpose of studying special characteristics of different bacteria, but a\r\nfull description of these would necessarily be so lengthy that in a work\r\nof this character they must be omitted. For details of this nature\r\nconsult standard reference books on bacteriological technique.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCONTAMINATION OF MILK.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo more important lesson is to be learned than that which relates to the\r\nways in which milk is contaminated with germ life of various kinds; for\r\nif these sources of infection are thoroughly recognized they can in\r\nlarge measure be prevented, and so the troubles which they engender\r\novercome. Various organisms find in milk a congenial field for\r\ndevelopment. Yeasts and some fungi are capable of growth, but more\r\nparticularly the bacteria.\r\n\r\n~Milk a suitable bacterial food.~ The readiness with which milk undergoes\r\nfermentative changes indicates that it is well adapted to nourish\r\nbacterial life. Not only does it contain all the necessary nutritive\r\nsubstances but they are diluted in proper proportions so as to render\r\nthem available for bacterial as well as mammalian life.\r\n\r\nOf the nitrogenous compounds, the albumen is in readily assimilable\r\nform. The casein, being insoluble, is not directly available, until it\r\nis acted upon by proteid-dissolving enzyms like trypsin which may be\r\nsecreted by bacteria. The fat is relatively resistant to change,\r\nalthough a few forms are capable of decomposing it. Milk sugar, however,\r\nis an admirable food for many species, acids and sometimes gases being\r\ngenerally produced.\r\n\r\n~Condition when secreted.~ When examined under normal conditions milk\r\nalways reveals bacterial life, yet in the secreting cells of the udder\r\nof a healthy cow germ life is not found. Only when the gland is diseased\r\nare bacteria found in any abundance. In the passage of the milk from\r\nthe secreting cells to the outside it receives its first infection, so\r\nthat when drawn from the animal it generally contains a considerable\r\nnumber of organisms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. Microscopic appearance of milk showing relative\r\nsize of fat globules and bacteria.]\r\n\r\n~Contamination of milk.~ From this time until it is consumed in one form\r\nor another, it is continually subjected to contamination. The major part\r\nof this infection occurs while the milk is on the farm and the degree of\r\ncare which is exercised while the product is in the hands of the milk\r\nproducer is the determining factor in the course of bacterial changes\r\ninvolved. This of course does not exclude the possibility of\r\ncontamination in the factory, but usually milk is so thoroughly seeded\r\nby the time it reaches the factory that the infection which occurs here\r\nplays a relatively minor role to that which happens earlier. The great\r\nmajority of the organisms in milk are in no wise dangerous to health,\r\nbut many species are capable of producing various fermentative changes\r\nthat injure the quality of the product for butter or cheese. To be able\r\nto control abnormal changes of an undesirable character one must know\r\nthe sources of infection which permit of the introduction of these\r\nunwelcome intruders.\r\n\r\n~Sources of infection.~ The bacterial life that finds its way into milk\r\nwhile it is yet on the farm may be traced to several sources, which may\r\nbe grouped under the following heads: unclean dairy utensils, fore milk,\r\ncoat of animal, and general atmospheric surroundings. The relative\r\nimportance of these various factors fluctuates in each individual\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n~Dairy utensils.~ Of first importance are the vessels that are used during\r\nmilking, and also all storage cans and other dairy utensils that come in\r\ncontact with the milk after it is drawn. By unclean utensils, actually\r\n_visible_ dirt need not always be considered, although such material is\r\noften present in cracks and angles of pails and cans. Unless cleansed\r\nwith especial care, these are apt to be filled with foul and decomposing\r\nmaterial that suffices to seed thoroughly the milk. Tin utensils are\r\nbest. Where made with joints, they should be well flushed with solder so\r\nas to be easily cleaned (see Fig. 6). In much of the cheaper tin ware on\r\nthe market, the soldering of joints and seams is very imperfect,\r\naffording a place of refuge for bacteria and dirt.\r\n\r\nCans are often used when they are in a condition wholly unsuitable for\r\nsanitary handling of milk. When the tin coating becomes broken and the\r\ncan is rusty, the quality of the milk is often profoundly affected.\r\nOlson[1] of the Wisconsin Station has shown that the action of rennet is\r\ngreatly impaired where milk comes in contact with a rusty iron surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of the form or hand separator a new milk utensil\r\nhas been added to those previously in use and one which is very\r\nfrequently not well cleaned. Where water is run through the machine to\r\nrinse out the milk particles, gross bacterial contamination occurs and\r\nthe use of the machine much increases the germ content of the milk.\r\nEvery time the separator is used it should be taken apart and thoroughly\r\ncleaned and dried before reassembling.[2]\r\n\r\n~Use of milk-cans for transporting factory by-products.~ The general\r\ncustom of using the milk-cans to carry back to the farm the factory\r\nby-products (skim-milk or whey) has much in it that is to be deprecated.\r\nThese by-products are generally rich in bacterial life, more especially\r\nwhere the closest scrutiny is not given to the daily cleaning of the\r\nvats and tanks. Too frequently the cans are not cleaned immediately upon\r\narrival at the farm, so that the conditions are favorable for rapid\r\nfermentation. Many of the taints that bother factories are directly\r\ntraceable to such a cause. A few dirty patrons will thus seriously\r\ninfect the whole supply. The responsibility for this defect should,\r\nhowever, not be laid entirely upon the shoulders of the producer. The\r\nfactory operator should see that the refuse material does not accumulate\r\nin the waste vats from day to day and is not transformed into a more or\r\nless putrid mass. A dirty whey tank is not an especially good object\r\nlesson to the patron to keep his cans clean.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that abnormal fermentations or even contagious diseases\r\nmay thus be disseminated.\r\n\r\nSuppose there appears in a dairy an infectious milk trouble, such as\r\nbitter milk. This milk is taken to the factory and passes unnoticed into\r\nthe general milk-supply. The skim-milk from the separator is of course\r\ninfected with the germ, and if conditions favor its growth, the whole\r\nlot soon becomes tainted. If this waste product is returned to the\r\ndifferent patrons in the same cans that are used for the fresh milk, the\r\nprobabilities are strongly in favor of some of the cans being\r\ncontaminated and thus infecting the milk supply of the patrons. If the\r\norganism is endowed with spores so that it can withstand unfavorable\r\nconditions, this taint may be spread from patron to patron simply\r\nthrough the infection of the vessels that are used in the transportation\r\nof the by-products. Connell has reported just such a case in a Canadian\r\ncheese factory where an outbreak of slimy milk was traced to infected\r\nwhey vats. Typhoid fever among people, foot and mouth disease and\r\ntuberculosis among stock are not infrequently spread in this way. In\r\nDenmark, portions of Germany and some states in America, compulsory\r\nheating of factory by-products is practiced to eliminate this danger.[3]\r\n\r\n~Pollution of cans from whey tanks.~ The danger is greater in cheese\r\nfactories than in creameries, for whey usually represents a more\r\nadvanced stage of fermentation than skim-milk. The higher temperature at\r\nwhich it is drawn facilitates more rapid bacterial growth, and the\r\nconditions under which it is stored in many factories contribute to the\r\nease with which fermentative changes can go on in it. Often this\r\nby-product is stored in wooden cisterns or tanks, situated below ground,\r\nwhere it becomes impossible to clean them out thoroughly. A custom that\r\nis almost universally followed in the Swiss cheese factories, here in\r\nthis country, as in Switzerland, is fully as reprehensible as any dairy\r\ncustom could well be. In Fig. 7 the arrangement in vogue for the\r\ndisposal of the whey is shown. The hot whey is run out through the\r\ntrough from the factory into the large trough that is placed over the\r\nrow of barrels, as seen in the foreground. Each patron thus has allotted\r\nto him in his individual barrel his portion of the whey, which he is\r\nsupposed to remove day by day. No attempt is made to clean out these\r\nreceptacles, and the inevitable result is that they become filled with a\r\nfoul, malodorous liquid, especially in summer. When such material is\r\ntaken home in the same set of cans that is used to bring the fresh milk\r\n(twice a day as is the usual custom in Swiss factories), it is no wonder\r\nthat this industry is seriously handicapped by \"gassy\" fermentations\r\nthat injure materially the quality of the product. Not only is the above\r\ndanger a very considerable one, but the quality of the factory\r\nby-product for feeding purposes, whether it is skim-milk or whey, is\r\nimpaired through the development of fermentative changes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. Swiss cheese factory (Wisconsin), showing\r\ncareless way in which whey is handled. Each patron's share is placed in\r\na barrel, from which it is removed by him. No attempt is made to cleanse\r\nthese receptacles.]\r\n\r\n~Improved methods of disposal of by-products.~ The difficulties which\r\nattend the distribution of these factory by-products have led to\r\ndifferent methods of solution. One is to use another separate set of\r\nreceptacles to carry back these products to the farm. This method has\r\nbeen tried, and while it is deemed impracticable by many to handle two\r\nsets of vessels, yet some of the most progressive factories report\r\nexcellent results where this method is in use.\r\n\r\nLarge barrels could be used for this purpose to economize in wagon\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nAnother method that has met with wider acceptance, especially in\r\ncreameries, is the custom of pasteurizing or scalding the skim-milk\r\nimmediately after it is separated, so that it is returned to the farmer\r\nin a hot condition. In factories where the whole milk is pasteurized,\r\nfurther treatment of the by-product is not necessary. In most factories\r\nsteam, generally exhaust, is used directly in the milk, and experience\r\nhas shown that such milk, without any cooling, will keep sweet for a\r\nconsiderable number of hours longer than the untreated product. It is\r\nnoteworthy that the most advanced and progressive factories are the ones\r\nthat appreciate the value of this work, and although it involves some\r\ntime and expense, experience has shown the utility of the process in\r\nthat a better grade of milk is furnished by the patrons of factories\r\nwhich follow this practice.[4] The exclusion of all danger of animal or\r\nhuman disease is also possible in this way.\r\n\r\n~Cleaning dairy utensils.~ The thorough cleaning of all dairy apparatus\r\nthat in any way comes in contact with the milk is one of the most\r\nfundamental and important problems in dairying. All such apparatus\r\nshould be so constructed as to permit of easy cleaning. Tinware,\r\npreferably of the pressed variety, gives the best surface for this\r\npurpose and is best suited for the handling of milk.\r\n\r\nMilk vessels should never be allowed to become dry when dirty, for dried\r\nparticles of milk residue are extremely difficult to remove. In cleaning\r\ndairy utensils they should first be rinsed in lukewarm instead of hot\r\nwater, so as to remove organic matter without coagulating the milk. Then\r\nwash thoroughly in hot water, using a good washing powder. The best\r\nwashing powders possess considerable disinfecting action.[5] Strong\r\nalkalies should not be used. After washing rinse thoroughly in clean hot\r\nwater. If steam is available, as it always is in creameries, cans and\r\npails should be turned over jet for a few moments. While a momentary\r\nexposure will not suffice to completely sterilize such a vessel, yet\r\nmany bacteria are killed in even a short exposure, and the cans dry more\r\nthoroughly and quickly when heated by steam.\r\n\r\nNot only should the greatest care be paid to the condition of the cans\r\nand milk-pails, but all dippers, strainers, and other utensils that come\r\nin contact with the milk must be kept equally clean. Cloth strainers,\r\nunless attended to, are objectionable, for the fine mesh of the cloth\r\nretains so much moisture that they become a veritable hot-bed of\r\nbacterial life, unless they are daily boiled or steamed.\r\n\r\nThe inability to thoroughly render vessels bacteria-free with the\r\nconveniences which are generally to be found on the farm has led in some\r\ncases to the custom of washing and sterilizing the milk cans at the\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\n~Germ content of milk utensils.~ Naturally the number of bacteria found in\r\ndifferent milk utensils after they have received their regular cleaning\r\nwill be subject to great fluctuations; but, nevertheless, such\r\ndeterminations are of value as giving a scientific foundation for\r\npractical methods of improvement. The following studies may serve to\r\nindicate the relative importance of the utensils as a factor in milk\r\ncontamination.\r\n\r\nTwo cans were taken, one of which had been cleaned in the ordinary way,\r\nwhile the other was sterilized by steaming. Before milking, the udder\r\nwas thoroughly cleaned and special precautions taken to avoid raising of\r\ndust; the fore milk was rejected. Milk drawn into these two cans showed\r\nthe following germ content:\r\n\r\n                      No. bacteria       Hours before\r\n                        per cc.           souring.\r\n\r\n    Steamed pail          165              28-1/2\r\n    Ordinary pail        4265              23\r\n\r\nHarrison[6] has shown how great a variation is in the bacterial content\r\nin milk cans. The utensils were rinsed with 100 cc. of sterile water and\r\nnumerical determinations of this rinsing water made. In poorly cleaned\r\ncans, the average germ content was 442,000; in cans washed in tepid\r\nwater and then scalded--the best farm practice--54,000, and in cans\r\ncarefully washed and then steamed for five minutes, 880.\r\n\r\nAnother method used by the writer is to wash the utensil with 100 cc.\r\nsterile wash water, using a sterile swab to remove dirt. Then repeat the\r\nprocess twice or more with fresh rinsing waters, making plate cultures\r\nfrom each. The following data were obtained from three such\r\ndeterminations:\r\n\r\nNo. bacteria in different washings.     Total No.\r\n   I.           II.         III.        bacteria.\r\n7,800,000    1,450,000     49,000       9,299,000\r\n  283,000       43,400     35,000         361,400\r\n1,685,000      105,000     61,400       1,851,400\r\n\r\n~Infection of milk in udder cavity.~ A frequently neglected but\r\nconsiderable factor of infection is that which is attributable to the\r\nbacteria which are present in the udder and which are removed in large\r\nnumbers during the milking process. An examination of the fore milk, i.\r\ne., the first few streams from each teat, and that which is subsequently\r\nwithdrawn, generally reveals a very much larger number of organisms in\r\nthe fore milk.[7] Not infrequently will this part of the milk when drawn\r\nunder as careful conditions as possible, contain several score thousand\r\norganisms per cc. If successive bacterial determinations are made at\r\ndifferent periods of the milking, as shown in the following experiment,\r\na marked diminution is to be noted after the first portion of the milk\r\nis removed:\r\n\r\n    _Bacterial content at different periods of milking._\r\n\r\n                Fore     200th    2000th    4300th    6500th   Strippings.\r\n                milk.     cc.      cc.       cc.       cc.\r\nExpt. 1        6,500     1,700     475      220        75         5\r\nExpt. 2        8,100     1,650     400      240        50        10\r\n\r\nBy some observers it has been claimed that it is possible to secure\r\nabsolutely sterile milk in the strippings but this is rarely so. It is\r\nquite probable that such reported results are due to the fact that too\r\nsmall quantities of milk were used in the examinations and so erroneous\r\nconclusions were drawn. This marked diminution in numbers indicates that\r\nthe larger proportion of the organisms found in the fore milk are\r\npresent in the lower portion of the udder and milk ducts. When\r\nconsideration is given to the structure of the udder, it is readily\r\napparent that infection will be greater here than above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. Sectional view of udder showing teat with milk\r\nduct connecting exterior with the milk cistern. Milk sinuses are mostly\r\nshown in cross section interspersed and below the secreting tissue\r\n(Moore and Ward).]\r\n\r\nThe udder is composed of secreting tissue (_gland cells_) held in place\r\nby fibrous connective tissue. Ramifying throughout this glandular\r\nstructure are numerous channels (_milk sinuses_) that serve to convey\r\nthe milk from the cells where it is produced into the _milk cistern_, a\r\ncommon receptacle just above the teats. This cavity is connected with\r\nthe exterior through the milk duct in the teat, which is more or less\r\ntightly closed by the circular sphincter muscles, thus preventing the\r\nmilk from flowing out. The mucous membranes of the milk duct and cistern\r\nare naturally moist. The habits of the animal render it impossible to\r\nprevent infection of the external opening at the end of the teat and\r\nthere is no mechanical reason why bacteria cannot readily find their way\r\nalong the moist lining membrane for some distance. If organisms are\r\nadapted to this kind of an environment, ideal conditions exist for their\r\nmultiplication, as moisture, warmth and suitable food supply are\r\npresent. The question arises how far up into this organ is penetration\r\npossible? Within late years numerous observations have been made on the\r\npresence of organisms in the upper portion of the udder in contact with\r\nthe secreting tissue.[8]\r\n\r\nThese investigations prove that bacteria are distributed throughout the\r\nwhole of the udder, although numerically they are much less abundant in\r\nthe region of the milk-secreting tissue than in the lower portion.\r\nWard's conclusions are \"that milk when secreted by the glands of a\r\nhealthy udder is sterile. It may however, immediately become\r\ncontaminated by the bacteria which are normally present in the smaller\r\nmilk ducts of the udder.\"\r\n\r\n~Nature of bacteria in fore milk.~ Generally speaking the number of\r\ndifferent species found in the fore milk is not large, and of those\r\nwhich do appear many occur at only occasional intervals. Moore[9] in the\r\nexamination of 9 udders found 20 different forms, and of these only 3\r\nspecies predominated, all of which proved to be micrococci. Streptococci\r\nhave also been quite frequently reported. Freudenreich[10] found the\r\nmost common types to be cocci, belonging to both the liquefying and\r\nnon-liquefying class.\r\n\r\nPeptonizing[11] and spore-bearing[12] species have also been reported as\r\nwell as gas-producing[13] forms allied to the colon bacillus. Such\r\nfindings are, however, due in all probability to accidental invasion.\r\nMost investigators report the absence of the distinctively lactic-acid\r\ngroup of organisms.[14]\r\n\r\n~Origin of bacteria in udder.~ There is no question but that many of the\r\ntypes of bacteria found in the udder gain access from the outside. Those\r\nbelonging to the spore-bearing, digesting and intestinal types have such\r\na favorable opportunity for introduction from outside and are so\r\nunlikely to have come directly from the body of the animal, that the\r\nexternal source of infection is much more probable. Whether this\r\nexplanation answers the origin of the cocci that are so generally found\r\nin the upper portion of the udder is questionable. The statement is\r\nordinarily made that the inner tissues of healthy organs are\r\nbacteria-free, but the studies of Ford[15] seem to indicate that 70 per\r\ncent. of such organs, removed under aseptic conditions from guinea pigs,\r\nrabbits, dogs and cats contained living organisms. Others have reported\r\nsimilar results in which cocci have been found[16] very similar to those\r\noccurring in the udder. These findings increase the probability that the\r\norigin of this type is from the blood. The persistence of certain\r\nspecies in the udder for months as noted by Ward indicates possibility\r\nof growth of some forms at least. Stocking[17] has shown where cows are\r\nnot milked clean that the germ content of succeeding milkings is greatly\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n~Artificial introduction of bacteria into udder.~ If bacteria are capable\r\nof actually developing in the udder proper, it ought to be possible to\r\neasily demonstrate this by the artificial introduction of cultures. In a\r\nnumber of cases[18] such experiments have been made with various\r\nsaprophytic forms, such as _B. prodigiosus_, lactic acid bacilli and\r\nothers. In no case has it appeared evident that actual growth has\r\noccurred, although the introduced organism has been demonstrated in\r\ndiminishing numbers for 5-6 days. Even the common lactic acid germ and a\r\nyellow liquefying coccus isolated from the fore milk failed to persist\r\nfor more than a few days when thus artificially introduced. This failure\r\nto colonize is indeed curious and needs explanation. Is it due to\r\nunsuitable environmental conditions or attributable to the germicidal\r\ninfluence of the milk?\r\n\r\nVarious body fluids are known to possess the property of destroying\r\nbacteria and it is claimed by Fokker[19] that this same property was\r\nfound in freshly drawn milk. This peculiarity has also been investigated\r\nby Freudenreich,[20] and Hunziker[21] who find a similar property.\r\n\r\nNo material increase in germ content takes place in milk for several\r\nhours when chilled to 40 deg.-70 deg. F.; on the other hand an actual,\r\nbut usually not a marked decrease is observed for about 6 hours. This\r\nphenomenon varies with the milk of different cows. Nothing is known as\r\nto the cause of this apparent germicidal action. The question is yet by\r\nno means satisfactorily settled, although the facts on which the\r\nhypothesis is based are not in controversy. If such a peculiarity\r\nbelongs to milk, it is not at all improbable that it may serve to keep\r\ndown the germ content in the udder. Freudenreich[22] found that udders\r\nwhich were not examined for some time after death showed abundant\r\ngrowth, which fact he attributed to the loss of this germicidal\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThe infection of the whole milk can be materially reduced by rejecting\r\nthe fore milk, but it is questionable whether such rejection is worth\r\nwhile, except in the case of \"sanitary\" dairies where milk is produced\r\nwith as low a germ content as possible. The intrinsic loss in butter fat\r\nin the fore milk is inconsiderable as the first few streams contain only\r\nabout one-fifth the normal fat content.\r\n\r\n~Infection of milk after withdrawal from animal.~ The germ content of the\r\nmilk, when it is being drawn from the animal is immediately increased\r\nupon contact with the atmosphere. These organisms are derived from the\r\nsurrounding air and the utensils in which the milk is received and\r\nstored. The number of organisms which find their way into the milk\r\ndepends largely upon the character of the surroundings. Bacteria are so\r\nintimately associated with dirt, dust and filth of all kinds that\r\nwherever the latter are found, the former are sure to be present in\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\nThe most important factors in the infection of the milk after withdrawal\r\nare the pollution which is directly traceable to the animal herself and\r\nthe condition of the milk utensils. Fortunately both of these sources of\r\ncontamination are capable of being greatly minimized by more careful\r\nmethods of handling.\r\n\r\n~Infection directly from the cow.~ It is a popular belief that the\r\norganisms found in milk are derived from the feed and water which the\r\ncow consumes, the same passing directly from the intestinal tract to the\r\nmilk by the way of the blood circulation. Such a view has no foundation\r\nin fact as bacteria absorbed into the circulation are practically all\r\ndestroyed in the tissues by the action of the body fluids and cells.[23]\r\nWhile organisms cannot pass readily from the intestine to the udder, yet\r\nthis must not be interpreted as indicating that no attention should be\r\ngiven to the bacterial character of the material consumed. The water\r\nsupply given should be pure and wholesome and no decomposed or spoiled\r\nfood should be used.\r\n\r\nThe infection traceable directly to the cow is modified materially by\r\nthe conditions under which the animal is kept and the character of the\r\nfeed consumed. The nature of the fecal matter is in part dependent upon\r\nthe character of the food. The more nitrogenous rations with which\r\nanimals are now fed leads to the production of softer fecal discharges\r\nwhich is more likely to soil the coat of the animal unless care is\r\ntaken. The same is true with animals kept on pasture in comparison with\r\nthose fed dry fodder.\r\n\r\nStall-fed animals, however, are more likely to have their flanks fouled,\r\nunless special attention is paid to the removal of the manure. All dairy\r\nstalls should be provided with a manure drop which should be cleaned as\r\nfrequently as circumstances will permit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. Showing the bacterial contamination arising from\r\nhair. These hairs were allowed to fall on a sterile gelatin surface. The\r\nadherent bacteria developed readily in this medium, and the number of\r\nbacteria thus introduced into the milk from these hairs can be estimated\r\nby the number of developing colonies.]\r\n\r\nThe animal herself contributes materially to the quota of germ life\r\nfinding its way into the milk through the dislodgment of dust and filth\r\nparticles adhering to its hairy coat. The nature of this coat is such as\r\nto favor the retention of these particles. Unless care is taken the\r\nflanks and udder become polluted with fecal matter, which upon drying is\r\ndisplaced with every movement of the animal. Every hair or dirt particle\r\nso dislodged and finding its way into the milk-pail adds its quota of\r\norganisms to the liquid. This can be readily demonstrated by placing\r\ncow's hairs collected with care on the moist surface of gelatin culture\r\nplates. Almost invariably, bacteria will be found in considerable\r\nnumbers adhering to such hairs as is indicated in Fig. 9. Dirt particles\r\nare even richer in germ life. Not only is there the dislodgment of\r\nhairs, epithelial scales and masses of dirt and filth, but during the\r\nmilking process, as at all other times, every motion of the animal is\r\naccompanied by a shower of _invisible_ particles more or less teeming\r\nwith bacterial life.\r\n\r\nThe amount of actual impurities found in milk is often considerable and\r\nwhen it is remembered that about one-half of fresh manure dissolves in\r\nmilk,[24] and thus does not appear as sediment, the presence of this\r\nundissolved residue bespeaks filthy conditions as to milking. From\r\nactual tests made, it is computed that the city of Berlin, Germany\r\nconsumes about 300 pounds of such dirt and filth daily. Renk has laid\r\ndown the following rule with reference to this insoluble dirt: If a\r\nsample of milk shows any evidence of impurity settling on a transparent\r\nbottom within two hours, it should be regarded as too dirty for use.\r\n\r\nWhile the number of organisms here introduced is at all times large, the\r\ncharacter of the species is of even greater import. Derived primarily\r\nfrom dirt and fecal matter, it is no wonder that such forms are able to\r\nproduce very undesirable fermentative changes.\r\n\r\n~Influence of milker.~ The condition of the milker is not to be ignored in\r\ndetermining all possible factors of infection, for when clothed in the\r\ndust-laden garments that have been worn all day, a favorable opportunity\r\nfor direct contamination is possible. The filthy practice of wetting the\r\nhands with milk just before milking is to be condemned. The milker's\r\nhands should be washed immediately before milking in clean water and\r\ndried. A pinch of vaseline on hands is sometimes used to obtain a firmer\r\ngrasp and prevents the ready dislodgment of scales.[25] It must also be\r\nborne in mind that the milker may spread disease through the milk. In\r\ntyphoid fever and diphtheria, the germs often remain in the system for\r\nweeks and thus make infection possible. Stocking[26] has shown that the\r\nindividual milker exerts a potent influence on the total germ content of\r\nmilk, even where the procedure is quite the same. In sanitary dairies\r\nmilkers are usually clad in white duck suits.\r\n\r\n~Milking by machinery.~ Several mechanical devices have been invented for\r\nmilking, some of which have been tested bacteriologically as to their\r\nefficiency. Harrison[27] has examined the \"Thistle\" machine but found a\r\nmuch higher germ content than with hand-drawn milk. The recent\r\nintroduction of the Burrel-Lawrence-Kennedy machine has led to numerous\r\ntests in which very satisfactory results have been obtained. If the\r\nrubber parts of the milker are thoroughly cleaned and kept in lime water\r\nsolution, they remain nearly sterile. When milk is properly handled, the\r\ngerm content may be greatly reduced.\r\n\r\n~Reduction in dirt and adherent bacteria.~ No factor of contamination is\r\nso susceptible of improvement as that which relates to the reduction in\r\nfilth and dirt which gains access during and immediately subsequent to\r\nthe milking. The care which is taken to keep the coat of the animal\r\nclean by grooming lessens very much the grosser portion of such\r\ncontamination, but with a dry, hairy coat, fine scales and dust\r\nparticles must of necessity be dislodged.[28] Ordinarily the patron\r\nthinks all evidence of such dirt is removed if the milk is strained, but\r\nthis process only lessens the difficulty; it does not overcome it.\r\nVarious methods are in use, the effectiveness of which is subject to\r\nconsiderable variation. Some of these look to the elimination of the\r\nbacteria after they are once introduced into the milk; others to the\r\nprevention of infection in the first place.\r\n\r\n_1. Straining the milk._ Most of the visible, solid particles of filth,\r\nsuch as hairs, dirt particles, etc., can be removed by simple straining,\r\nthe time-honored process of purification. As ordinarily carried out,\r\nthis process often contributes to instead of diminishing the germ life\r\nin milk. The strainer cloths unless washed and thoroughly sterilized by\r\nboiling harbor multitudes of organisms from day to day and may thus\r\nactually add to the organisms present. Various methods have been\r\nsuggested for this simple process, but the most practical and efficient\r\nstrainer is that made of fine wire gauze to which is added 3-4 layers of\r\ncheese cloth, the whole to set over the storage milk can.\r\n\r\n_2. Filtration._ In Europe especially, the system of cleaning milk by\r\nfiltration through sand, gravel and other substances has been quite\r\nextensively used. These filters are built in sections and the milk\r\npasses from below upward. The filtering substance is washed in hot water\r\nimmediately after use and then steamed and finally baked. While it is\r\npossible to remove the solid impurities in this way, the germ content\r\ncannot be greatly reduced.[29] Cellulose filters have also been\r\nsuggested[30] as an improvement over the sand filters. Methods of\r\nfiltration of this character have not been used under commercial\r\nconditions here in this country.\r\n\r\n_3. Clarification in separator._ Within recent years the custom has\r\ngrown of clarifying milk or removing the visible dirt by passing the\r\nmilk through a centrifugal separator the cream and skim milk being\r\nremixed after separation. This process naturally removes the solid\r\nimpurities as dirt, hairs, epithelial scales and cells, also some of the\r\ncasein, making what is known as centrifuge slime. This conglomerate mass\r\nis incomparably rich in germ life and the natural inference would be\r\nthat the bacterial content of the milk would be greatly reduced by this\r\nprocedure. Eckles and Barnes[31] noted a reduction of 37 to 56 per cent.\r\nof the bacteria but others have failed to observe such reductions.[32]\r\nThis condition is explained by the more thorough breaking up of the\r\nbacterial masses in the process, thus apparently not reducing them in\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat surprising that in spite of the elimination of much\r\norganic matter and bacteria, such clarified milk sours as rapidly as the\r\nuntreated product.[33]\r\n\r\nThe mechanical shock of separation ruptures the clusters of fat globules\r\nand so delays creaming and also lessens the consistency of cream derived\r\nfrom such milk. This practical disadvantage together with the increased\r\nexpense of the operation and the failure to materially enhance the\r\nkeeping quality of the product outweigh the advantage which might come\r\nfrom removal of solid impurities which can be largely accomplished on\r\nthe farm by efficient straining.\r\n\r\n_4. Washing the udder._ If a surface is moist, bacteria adherent to it\r\ncannot be dislodged by ordinary movements. Thus the air over\r\nsnow-covered mountains or oceans is relatively devoid of germ life. The\r\nmethod of moistening the udder is applied with success to the hairy coat\r\nof the animal thus subserving the double purpose of cleaning the animal\r\nand preventing in large measure the continual dislodgment of dust\r\nparticles. After these parts have been well carded to remove loose hairs\r\nand dirt particles, the skin should be thoroughly moistened with clean\r\nwater and then wiped. It has been urged that this procedure lessens the\r\nyield of milk but Eckles[34] concludes from experiments that when the\r\nanimal becomes accustomed to this treatment, no noticeable change in\r\namount of milk or butter-fat is produced.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of this method in reducing the actual amount of dirt\r\nand filth introduced into the milk as well as the great diminution in\r\ngerm life is shown by the instructive experiments of Fraser[35] who\r\nfound that the actual amount of dirt dislodged from udders of apparently\r\nclean animals during the milking process was three and one-half times as\r\nmuch as when the cow's udders were washed. From udders visibly polluted\r\none ounce of such filth was removed in 275 pounds of milk, while from\r\ncows whose udders had been washed, the same amount of dirt was\r\ndistributed through 24,030 pounds.\r\n\r\nFraser observed as a result of 420 examinations that the average germ\r\ncontent of 4-inch culture dishes under clean but unwashed udders was\r\n578, while under washed animals it was reduced to 192. From numerous\r\ntests made in the writer's laboratory, it is evident that the germ\r\ncontent of the milk in the pail is increased from 20,000-40,000 bacteria\r\n_per minute_ during the milking period. By far the larger part of this\r\npollution can be easily prevented by cleaning and dampening the udder.\r\n\r\n_5. Diminishing exposed surface of pail._ The entrance of organisms into\r\nthe milk can be greatly reduced by lessening the area of the milk pail\r\ndirectly exposed to the dust shower. A number of so-called sanitary or\r\nhygienic milk pails have been devised for this purpose. In one case the\r\npail is smaller at the top than bottom, but in most of them the common\r\nform is kept and the exposed area is lessened by means of a cover, the\r\nmilk being received through a narrower opening. In some cases, strainers\r\nare also interposed so as to remove more effectually the coarse\r\nparticles. It is necessary to have these covers and strainers\r\nconstructed in such a way so they can be easily removed and cleaned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. Sanitary milk pails designed to diminish the\r\nintroduction of hairs, scales, dirt, etc., into milk.]\r\n\r\nStocking tested one of these pails (A, Fig. 10) and found that 63 per\r\ncent of the dirt and 29 per cent. of the bacteria were prevented from\r\npassing into the milk. Eckles examined one in which the germ content was\r\nfound to be 3200 per cc. as against 43200 per cc. in a common open\r\npail. This milk did not sour until it was 64 hours old in the first case\r\nwhile in the latter it curdled in 43 hours.\r\n\r\n~Air in barn.~ The atmosphere of the barn where the milking is done may\r\nfrequently contribute considerable infection. Germ life is incapable of\r\ndevelopment in the air, but in a dried condition, organisms may retain\r\ntheir vitality for long periods. Anything which contributes to the\r\nproduction of dust in the stable and aids in the stirring up of the same\r\nincreases the number of organisms to be found in the air (Fig. 11).\r\nThus, the feeding of dry fodder and the bedding of animals with straw\r\nadds greatly to the germ life floating in the air. Dust may vary much in\r\nits germ content depending upon its origin. Fraser found the dust from\r\ncorn meal to contain only about one-sixth to one-eighth as much germ\r\nlife as that from hay or bran.[36] In time most of these dust particles\r\nsettle to the floor, but where the herd is kept in the barn, the\r\nconstant movement of the animals keeps these particles more or less in\r\nmotion. Much can be done by forethought to lessen the germ content of\r\nstables. Feeding dry feed should not be done until after milking.[37] In\r\nsome of the better sanitary dairies, it is customary to have a special\r\nmilking room that is arranged with special reference to the elimination\r\nof all dust. In this way this source of infection may be quite obviated\r\nas the air of a clean, still room is relatively free from bacteria,\r\nespecially if the floor is moistened. It has often been noted that the\r\nmilk of stall-fed animals does not keep as well as that milked out of\r\ndoors, a condition in part attributable to the lessened contamination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. Effect of contaminated air. The number of spots\r\nindicate the colonies that have developed from the bacteria which fell\r\nin 30 seconds on the surface of the gelatin plate (3 inches in\r\ndiameter). This exposure was made at time the cows were fed.]\r\n\r\n~Relative importance of different sources of infection.~ It is impossible\r\nto measure accurately the influence of the different sources of\r\ninfection as these are continually subject to modification in each and\r\nevery case. As a general rule, however, where milk is drawn and handled\r\nwithout any special care, the utensils and the animal contribute the\r\nlarger proportion of dirt and bacteria that find their way into milk.\r\nWhere the manner of milking and handling is designed to exclude the\r\nlargest number of organisms possible, the bacteria appearing in the fore\r\nmilk make up the major portion remaining. By putting into practice the\r\nvarious suggestions that have been made with reference to diminishing\r\nthe bacterial content of milk, it is possible to greatly reduce the\r\nnumber of organisms found therein, and at the same time materially\r\nimprove the keeping quality of the milk. Backhaus[38] estimates that\r\nthe germ life in milk can be easily reduced to one-two thousandth of its\r\noriginal number by using care in milking. He reports a series of\r\nexperiments covering two years in which milk was secured that averaged\r\nless than 10,000 bacteria per cc., while that secured under ordinary\r\nconditions averaged over 500,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. Bacterial content of milk handled in ordinary\r\nway. Each spot represents a colony growing on gelatin plate. Compare\r\nwith Fig. 13, where same quantity of milk is used in making culture.\r\nOver 15,000 bacteria per cc. in this milk.]\r\n\r\nFig. 13 gives an illustration as to what care in milking will do in the\r\nway of eliminating bacteria. Fig. 12 shows a gelatin plate seeded with\r\nthe same quantity of milk that was used in making the culture indicated\r\nby Fig. 13. The first plate was inoculated with milk drawn under good\r\nconditions, the germ content of which was found to be 15,500 bacteria\r\nper cc., while the sample secured under as nearly aseptic conditions as\r\npossible (Fig. 13) contained only 330 organisms in the same volume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. Bacterial content of milk drawn with care.\r\nDiminished germ content is shown by smaller number of colonies (330\r\nbacteria per cc.). Compare this culture with that shown in Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\n~\"Sanitary\" or \"certified\" milk.~ Within recent years there has been more\r\nor less generally introduced into many cities, the custom of supplying\r\nhigh grade milk that has been handled in a way so as to diminish its\r\ngerm content as much as possible. Milk of this character is frequently\r\nknown as \"sanitary,\" \"hygienic\" or \"certified,\" the last term being used\r\nin connection with a certification from veterinary authorities or boards\r\nof health as to the freedom of animals from contagious disease.\r\nFrequently a numerical bacterial standard is exacted as a pre-requisite\r\nto the recommendation of the board of examining physicians. Thus, the\r\nPediatric Society of Philadelphia requires all children's milk that\r\nreceives its recommendation to have not more than 10,000 bacteria per\r\ncc. Such a standard has its value in the scrupulous cleanliness that\r\nmust prevail in order to secure these results. This in itself is\r\npractically a guarantee of the absence of those bacteria liable to\r\nproduce trouble in children. The number of organisms found in such milks\r\nis surprisingly low when compared with ordinary milk. Naturally, there\r\nis considerable fluctuation from day to day, and occasionally the germ\r\ncontent is increased to a high figure without any apparent reason. The\r\naverage results though, show a greatly reduced number of organisms. De\r\nSchweinitz[39] found in a Washington dairy in 113 examinations extending\r\nthroughout a year, an average of 6,485 bacteria per cc. The daily\r\nanalyses made of the Walker-Gordon supply sold in Philadelphia for an\r\nentire year, showed that the milk almost always contained less than\r\n5,000 bacteria per cc. and on 120 days out of the year the germ content\r\nwas 1,000 organisms per cc. or less.\r\n\r\nFrom a practical point of view, the improvement in quality of sanitary\r\nmilk, in comparison with the ordinary product is seen in the enhanced\r\nkeeping quality. During the Paris Exposition in 1900, milk and cream\r\nfrom several such dairies in the United States were shipped to Paris,\r\narriving in good condition after 15 to 18 days transit. When milk has\r\nbeen handled in such a way, it is evident that it is much better suited\r\nto serve as a food supply than where it has undergone the fermentative\r\nchanges incident to the development of myriads of organisms.\r\n\r\n~Application of foregoing precautions to all milk producers.~ Milk is so\r\nsusceptible to bacterial changes that it is necessary to protect it from\r\ninvasion, if its original purity is to be maintained, and yet, from a\r\npractical point of view, the use to which it is destined has much to do\r\nwith the care necessary to take in handling. The effect of the bacterial\r\ncontamination of milk depends largely upon the way in which the product\r\nis used. To the milk-man engaged in the distribution of milk for direct\r\nconsumption, all bacterial life is more or less of a detriment, while to\r\nthe butter-maker and cheese-maker some forms are a direct necessity. It\r\nis unnecessary and impracticable to require the same degree of care in\r\nhandling milk destined to be worked up into factory products as is done,\r\nfor instance, in sanitary milk supplies, but this fact should not be\r\ninterpreted to mean that the care of milk for factories is a matter of\r\nsmall consequence. In fact no more important dairy problem exists, and\r\nthe purer and better the quality of the raw material the better the\r\nproduct will be. Particularly is this true with reference to\r\ncheese-making.\r\n\r\nDairymen have learned many lessons in the severe school of experience,\r\nbut it is earnestly to be hoped that future conditions will not be\r\nsummed up in the words of the eminent German dairy scientist, Prof.\r\nFleischmann, when he says that \"all the results of scientific\r\ninvestigation which have found such great practical application in the\r\ntreatment of disease, in disinfection, and in the preservation of\r\nvarious products, are almost entirely ignored in milking.\"\r\n\r\n~Growth of bacteria in milk.~ Milk is so well suited as a medium for the\r\ndevelopment of germ life that it might be expected that all\r\nmicroorganisms would develop rapidly therein, and yet, as a matter of\r\nfact, growth does not begin at once, even though the milk may be richly\r\nseeded. At ordinary temperatures, such as 70 deg. F., no appreciable\r\nincrease is to be noted for a period of 6-9 hours; at lower temperatures\r\n(54 deg. F.) this period is prolonged to 30-40 hours or even longer. After\r\nthis period has elapsed, active growth begins and continues more or less\r\nrapidly until after curdling.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this suspended development is attributed to the germicidal\r\nproperties inherent to the milk.[40]\r\n\r\nMilk is of course seeded with a considerable variety of organisms at\r\nfirst. The liquefying and inert species are the most abundant, the\r\ndistinctively lactic acid class occurring sparsely, if at all. As milk\r\nincreases in age, germ growth begins to occur. More or less development\r\nof all types go on, but soon the lactic species gain the ascendency,\r\nowing to their being better suited to this environment; they soon\r\noutstrip all other species, with the result that normal curdling\r\ngenerally supervenes. The growth of this type is largely conditioned by\r\nthe presence of the milk sugar. If the sugar is removed from milk by\r\ndialysis, the liquid undergoes putrefactive changes due to the fact that\r\nthe putrefactive bacteria are able to grow if no acid is produced.\r\n\r\n~Relation of temperature to growth.~ When growth does once begin in milk,\r\nthe temperature at which it is stored exerts the most profound effect on\r\nthe rate of development. When milk is not artificially cooled, it\r\nretains its heat for some hours, and consequently the conditions become\r\nvery favorable for the rapid multiplication of the contained organisms,\r\nas is shown in following results obtained by Freudenreich[41]:\r\n\r\n    _No. of bacteria per cc. in milk kept at different temperatures._\r\n\r\n                                 77 deg. F.       95 deg. F.\r\n     5 hrs. after milking       10,000        30,000\r\n     8  \"     \"    \"            25,000    12,000,000\r\n    12  \"     \"    \"            46,000    35,280,000\r\n    26  \"     \"    \"         5,700,000    50,000,000\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. Effect of cooling milk on the growth of\r\nbacteria.]\r\n\r\nConn[42] is inclined to regard temperature of more significance in\r\ndetermining the keeping quality than the original infection of the milk\r\nitself. Milk which curdled in 18 hours at 98 deg. F., did not curdle in 48\r\nhours at 70 deg., and often did not change in two weeks, if the\r\ntemperature was kept at 50 deg. F.\r\n\r\nWhere kept for a considerable period at this low temperature, the milk\r\nbecomes filled with bacteria of the undesirable putrefactive type, the\r\nlactic group being unable to form acid in any appreciable amounts.\r\nRunning well water can be used for cooling, if it is possible to secure\r\nit at a temperature of 48 deg.-50 deg. F. The use of ice, of course, gives\r\nbetter results, and in summer is greatly to be desired. The influence of\r\nthese lowered temperatures makes it possible to ship milk long\r\ndistances[43] by rail for city supplies, if the temperature is kept low\r\nduring transit.\r\n\r\n~Mixing night and morning milk.~ Not infrequently it happens when old milk\r\nis mixed with new, that the course of the fermentative changes is more\r\nrapid than would have been the case if the two milks had been kept\r\napart. Thus, adding the cooled night milk to the warm morning milk\r\nsometimes produces more rapid changes in both. The explanation for this\r\noften imperfectly understood phenomenon is that germ growth may have\r\ngone on in the cooled milk, and when this material is added to the\r\nwarmer, but bacteria-poor, fresh milk, the temperature of the whole mass\r\nis raised to a point suitable for the more rapid growth of all bacteria\r\nthan would have occurred if the older milk had been kept chilled.\r\n\r\n~Number of bacteria in milk.~ The number of organisms found in milk\r\ndepends upon (1) the original amount of contamination, (2) the age of\r\nthe milk, and (3) the temperature at which it has been held. These\r\nfactors all fluctuate greatly in different cases; consequently, the germ\r\nlife is subject to exceedingly wide variations. Here in America, milk\r\nreaches the consumer with less bacteria than in Europe, although it may\r\noften be older. This is due largely to the more wide-spread use of ice\r\nfor chilling the milk _en route_ to market. Examinations have been made\r\nof various supplies with the following results: Sedgwick and Batchelder\r\nfound in 57 tests of Boston milk from 30,000-4,220,000 per cc. Jordan\r\nand Heineman found 30% of samples of Chicago milk to range from 100,000\r\nto 1,000,000 while nearly one half were from 1-20,000,000 per cc. The\r\ngerm content of city milks increase rapidly in the summer months.\r\nPark[44] found 250,000 organisms per cc. in winter, about 1,000,000 in\r\ncool weather and 5,000,000 per cc. in hot summer weather. Knox and\r\nBassett in Baltimore report 1,500,000 in spring and nearly 4,500,000 in\r\nsummer. Eckles[45] studied milk under factory conditions. He finds from\r\n1,000,000 to 5,000,000 per cc. in winter, and in summer from 15-30\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\n~Bacterial standards for city supplies.~ It would be very desirable to\r\nhave a hygienic standard for city milk supplies, as there is a butter\r\nfat and milk-solid test, but the wide spread variation in germ content\r\nand the impracticability of utilizing ordinary bacterial determinations\r\n(on account of time required) makes the selection of such a standard\r\ndifficult. Some hold, as Park, that such a standard is feasible. The New\r\nYork City Milk commission has set a standard of 30,000 bacteria per cc.\r\nfor their certified milk and 100,000 per cc. for inspected milk.\r\nRochester, N. Y. has attempted the enforcement of such a standard\r\n(limit, 100,000 per cc.) with good results it is claimed while Boston\r\nhas placed the legal limit at 500,000 per cc. Quantitative standards\r\nwould seem more applicable to \"certified\" or sanitary supplies than to\r\ngeneral city supplies, where the wide range in conditions lead to such\r\nenormous variations that the bacterial standard seems too refined a\r\nmethod for practical routine inspection.\r\n\r\n~Other tests.~ Any test to be of much service must be capable of being\r\nquickly applied. The writer believes for city milk inspectors that the\r\nacid test would serve a very useful purpose. This test measures the\r\nacidity of the milk. There is, of course, no close and direct\r\nrelationship between the development of acidity and the growth of\r\nbacteria, yet in a general way one follows the other at normal\r\ntemperatures. Where the temperature is kept rather low, bacterial growth\r\nmight go on without much acid development, but in the great majority of\r\ncases a high degree of acidity means either old milk, in which there has\r\nbeen a long period of incubation, or high temperature, where rapid\r\nbacterial growth has been possible. Either of these conditions\r\nencourages germ growth and thus impairs the quality of the milk.\r\n\r\nThe rapid determination of acidity may be made in an approximate manner\r\nso as to serve as a test at the weigh-can or intake. The test is best\r\nmade by the use of the well known alkaline tablet which is composed of a\r\nsolid alkali, and the indicator, phenolphthalein. The tablets are\r\ndissolved in water, one to each ounce used. A number of white cups are\r\nfilled with the proper quantity of the solution necessary to neutralize\r\nsay, 0.2 per cent. lactic acid. Then, as the milk is delivered, the\r\nproper quantity is taken from each can to which is added the tablet\r\nsolution. A retention of the pink color shows that there is not\r\nsufficient acid in the milk to neutralize the alkali used; a\r\ndisappearance of color indicates an excess of acid. The standard\r\nselected is of course arbitrarily chosen. In our experience, 0.2 per\r\ncent. acidity (figured as lactic), has proven a satisfactory point. With\r\ncarefully handled milk the acidity ought to be reduced to about 0.15 per\r\ncent. The acidity of the milk may be abnormally reduced if milk is kept\r\nin rusty cans, owing to action of acid on the metal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. Apparatus used in making rapid acid test. A\r\ndefinite quantity of the alkali solution and indicator is placed in the\r\nwhite tea cup. To this is added the quantity of milk by means of the\r\ncartridge measure which would just be neutralized if the acidity was 0.2\r\nper cent. A retention of the pink color shows a low acid milk; its\r\ndisappearance, a high acid milk.]\r\n\r\n~Kinds of bacteria in milk.~ The number of bacteria in milk is not of so\r\nmuch consequence as the kinds present. With reference to the number of\r\ndifferent species, the more dirt and foreign matter the milk contains,\r\nthe larger the number of varieties found in the same. While milk may\r\ncontain forms that are injurious to man, still the great majority of\r\nthem have no apparent effect on human health. In their effect on milk,\r\nthe case is much different. Depending upon their action in milk, they\r\nmay be grouped into three classes:\r\n\r\n1. Inert group, those producing no visible change in the milk.\r\n\r\n2. Sour milk forms, those breaking up the milk sugar with or without the\r\nformation of gas.\r\n\r\n3. Digesting or peptonizing group, those capable of rendering the casein\r\nof milk soluble and more or less completely digested.\r\n\r\nA surprisingly large number of bacteria that are found in milk belong to\r\nthe first class. Undoubtedly they affect the chemical characteristics of\r\nthe milk somewhat, but not to the extent that it becomes physically\r\nperceptible. Eckles[46] reports in a creamery supply from 20 to 55 per\r\ncent. of entire flora as included in this class.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important group is that embraced under the second head.\r\nIt includes not only the true lactic acid types in which no gas is\r\nformed, but those species capable of producing gases and various kinds\r\nof acids. These organisms are the distinctively milk bacteria, although\r\nthey do not predominate when the milk is first drawn. Their adaptation\r\nto this medium is normally shown, however, by this extremely rapid\r\ngrowth, in which they soon gain the ascendency over all other species\r\npresent. It is to this lactic acid class that the favorable\r\nflavor-producing organisms belong which are concerned in butter-making.\r\nThey are also indispensable in cheese-making.\r\n\r\nThe third class represents those capable of producing a liquefied or\r\ndigested condition on gelatin or in milk. They are usually the\r\nspore-bearing species which gain access from filth and dirt. Their high\r\npowers of resistance due to spores makes it difficult to eradicate this\r\ntype, although they are materially held in subjection by the lactic\r\nbacteria. The number of different kinds that have been found in milk is\r\nquite considerable, something over 200 species having been described\r\nmore or less thoroughly. In all probability, however, many of these\r\nforms will be found to be identical when they are subjected to a more\r\ncritical study.\r\n\r\n~Direct absorption of taints.~ A tainted condition in milk may result from\r\nthe development of bacteria, acting upon various constituents of the\r\nmilk, and transforming these in such a way as to produce by-products\r\nthat impair the flavor or appearance of the liquid; or it may be\r\nproduced by the milk being brought in contact with any odoriferous or\r\naromatic substance, under conditions that permit of the direct\r\nabsorption of such odors.\r\n\r\nThis latter class of taints is entirely independent of bacterial action,\r\nand is largely attributable to the physical property which milk\r\npossesses of being able to absorb volatile odors, the fat in particular,\r\nhaving a great affinity for many of these substances. This direct\r\nabsorption may occur before the milk is withdrawn from the animal, or\r\nafterwards if exposed to strong odors.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for the milk of animals advanced in lactation to have\r\na more or less strongly marked odor and taste; sometimes this is apt to\r\nbe bitter, at other times salty to the taste. It is a defect that is\r\npeculiar to individual animals and is liable to recur at approximately\r\nthe same period in lactation.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar \"cowy\" or \"animal odor\" of fresh milk is an inherent\r\npeculiarity that is due to the direct absorption of volatile elements\r\nfrom the animal herself. This condition is very much exaggerated when\r\nthe animal consumes strong-flavored substances as garlic, leeks, turnips\r\nand cabbage. The volatile substances that give to these vegetables their\r\ncharacteristic odor are quickly diffused through the system, and if such\r\nfoods are consumed some few hours before milking, the odor in the milk\r\nwill be most pronounced. The intensity of such taints is diminished\r\ngreatly and often wholly disappears, if the milking is not done for some\r\nhours (8-12) after such foods are consumed.\r\n\r\nThis same principle applies in lesser degree to many green fodders that\r\nare more suitable as feed for animals, as silage, green rye, rape, etc.\r\nNot infrequently, such fodders as these produce so strong a taint in\r\nmilk as to render it useless for human use. Troubles from such sources\r\ncould be entirely obviated by feeding limited quantities of such\r\nmaterial immediately after milking. Under such conditions the taint\r\nproduced is usually eliminated before the next milking. The milk of\r\nswill-fed cows is said to possess a peculiar taste, and the urine of\r\nanimals fed on this food is said to be abnormally acid. Brewers' grains\r\nand distillery slops when fed in excess also induce a similar condition\r\nin the milk.\r\n\r\nMilk may also acquire other than volatile substances directly from the\r\nanimal, as in cases where drugs, as belladonna, castor oil, sulfur,\r\nturpentine, jalap, croton oil, and many others have been used as\r\nmedicine. Such mineral poisons as arsenic have been known to appear\r\neight hours after ingestion, and persist for a period of three weeks\r\nbefore being eliminated.\r\n\r\n~Absorption of odors after milking.~ If milk is brought in contact with\r\nstrong odors after being drawn from the animal, it will absorb them\r\nreadily, as in the barn, where frequently it is exposed to the odor of\r\nmanure and other fermenting organic matter.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a popular belief that milk evolves odors and cannot\r\nabsorb them so long as it is warmer than the surrounding air, but from\r\nexperimental evidence, the writer[47] has definitely shown that the\r\ndirect absorption of odors takes place much more rapidly when the milk\r\nis warm than when cold, although under either condition, it absorbs\r\nvolatile substances with considerable avidity. In this test fresh milk\r\nwas exposed to an atmosphere impregnated with odors of various essential\r\noils and other odor-bearing substances. Under these conditions, the\r\ncooler milk was tainted very much less than the milk at body temperature\r\neven where the period of exposure was brief. It is therefore evident\r\nthat an exposure in the cow barn where the volatile emanations from the\r\nanimals themselves and their excreta taint the air will often result in\r\nthe absorption of these odors by the milk to such an extent as to\r\nseriously affect the flavor.\r\n\r\nThe custom of straining the milk in the barn has long been deprecated as\r\ninconsistent with proper dairy practice, and in the light of the above\r\nexperiments, an additional reason is evident why this should not be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nEven after milk is thoroughly cooled, it may absorb odors as seen where\r\nthe same is stored in a refrigerator with certain fruits, meats, fish,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n~Distinguishing bacterial from non-bacterial taints.~ In perfectly fresh\r\nmilk, it is relatively easy to distinguish between taints caused by the\r\ngrowth of bacteria and those attributable to direct absorption.\r\n\r\nIf the taint is evident at time of milking, it is in all probability due\r\nto character of feed consumed, or possibly to medicines. If, however,\r\nthe intensity of the taint grows more pronounced as the milk becomes\r\nolder, then it is probably due to living organisms, which require a\r\ncertain period of incubation before their fermentative properties are\r\nmost evident.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if the difficulty is of bacterial origin, it can be frequently\r\ntransferred to another lot of milk (heated or sterilized is preferable)\r\nby inoculating same with some of the original milk. Not all abnormal\r\nfermentations are able though to compete with the lactic acid bacteria,\r\nand hence outbreaks of this sort soon die out by the re-establishment of\r\nmore normal conditions.\r\n\r\n~Treatment of directly absorbed taints.~ Much can be done to overcome\r\ntaints of this nature by exercising greater care in regard to the feed\r\nof animals, and especially as to the time of feeding and milking. But\r\nwith milk already tainted, it is often possible to materially improve\r\nits condition. Thorough aeration has been frequently recommended, but\r\nmost satisfactory results have been obtained where a combined process of\r\naeration and pasteurization was resorted to. Where the milk is used in\r\nmaking butter, the difficulty has been successfully met by washing the\r\ncream with twice its volume of hot water in which a little saltpeter has\r\nbeen dissolved (one teaspoonful per gallon), and then separating it\r\nagain.[48]\r\n\r\nThe treatment of abnormal conditions due to bacteria has been given\r\nalready under the respective sources of infection, and is also still\r\nfurther amplified in following chapter.\r\n\r\n~Aeration.~ It is a common belief that aeration is of great aid in\r\nimproving the quality of milk, yet, when closely studied, no material\r\nimprovement can be determined, either where the milk is made into butter\r\nor sold as milk. Dean in Canada and Storch in Denmark have both\r\nexperimented on the influence of aeration in butter making, but with\r\nnegative results. Marshall and Doane failed to observe any material\r\nimprovement in keeping quality, but it is true that odors are eliminated\r\nfrom the milk during aeration. The infection of the milk during aeration\r\noften more than counterbalances the reputed advantage. Especially is\r\nthis so if the aeration is carried out in an atmosphere that is not\r\nperfectly clean and pure.\r\n\r\nIn practice aeration differs greatly. In some cases, air is forced into\r\nthe milk; in others, the milk is allowed to distribute itself in a thin\r\nsheet over a broad surface and fall some distance so that it is brought\r\nintimately in contact with the air. This latter process is certainly\r\nmuch more effective if carried out under conditions which preclude\r\ninfection. It must be remembered that aeration is frequently combined\r\nwith cooling, in which case the reputed advantages may not be entirely\r\nattributable to the process of aeration.\r\n\r\n~Infection of milk in the factory.~ The problem of proper handling of milk\r\nis not entirely solved when the milk is delivered to the factory or\r\ncreamery, although it might be said that the danger of infection is much\r\ngreater while the milk is on the farm.\r\n\r\nIn the factory, infection can be minimized because effective measures of\r\ncleanliness can be more easily applied. Steam is available in most\r\ncases, so that all vats, cans, churns and pails can be thoroughly\r\nscalded. Special emphasis should be given to the matter of cleaning\r\npumps and pipes. The difficulty of keeping these utensils clean often\r\nleads to neglect and subsequent infection. In Swiss cheese factories,\r\nthe custom of using home-made rennet solutions is responsible for\r\nconsiderable factory infection. Natural rennets are soaked in whey which\r\nis kept warm in order to extract the rennet ferment. This solution when\r\nused for curdling the milk often adds undesirable yeasts and other\r\ngas-generating organisms, which are later the cause of abnormal ferment\r\naction in the cheese (See page 186).\r\n\r\nThe influence of the air on the germ content of the milk is, as a rule,\r\noverestimated. If the air is quiet, and free from dust, the amount of\r\ngerm life in the same is not relatively large. In a creamery or factory,\r\ninfection from this source ought to be much reduced, for the reason that\r\nthe floors and wall are, as a rule, quite damp, and hence germ life\r\ncannot easily be dislodged. The majority of organisms found under such\r\nconditions come from the person of the operators and attendants. Any\r\ninfection can easily be prevented by having the ripening cream-vats\r\ncovered with a canvas cloth. The clothing of the operator should be\r\ndifferent from the ordinary wearing-apparel. If made of white duck, the\r\npresence of dirt is more quickly recognized, and greater care will\r\ntherefore be taken than if ordinary clothes are worn.\r\n\r\nThe surroundings of the factory have much to do with the danger of germ\r\ninfection. Many factories are poorly constructed and the drainage is\r\npoor, so that filth and slime collect about and especially under the\r\nfactory. The emanations from these give the peculiar \"factory odor\" that\r\nindicates fermenting matter. Not only are these odors absorbed\r\ndirectly, but germ life from the same is apt to find its way into the\r\nmilk. Connell[49] has recently reported a serious defect in cheese that\r\nwas traced to germ infection from defective factory drains.\r\n\r\nThe water supply of a factory is also a question of prime importance.\r\nWhen taken from a shallow well, especially if surface drainage from the\r\nfactory is possible, the water may be contaminated to such an extent as\r\nto introduce undesirable bacteria in such numbers that the normal course\r\nof fermentation may be changed. The quality of the water, aside from\r\nflavor, can be best determined by making a curd test (p. 76) which is\r\ndone by adding some of the water to boiled milk and incubating the same.\r\nIf \"gassy\" fermentations occur, it signifies an abnormal condition. In\r\ndeep wells, pumped as thoroughly as is generally the case with factory\r\nwells, the germ content should be very low, ranging from a few score to\r\na few hundred bacteria per cc. at most.\r\n\r\nHarrison[50] has recently traced an off-flavor in cheese in a Canadian\r\nfactory to an infection arising from the water-supply. He found the same\r\ngerm in both water and cheese and by inoculating a culture into\r\npasteurized milk succeeded in producing the undesirable flavor. The\r\ndanger from ice is much less, for the reason that good dairy practice\r\ndoes not sanction using ice directly in contact with milk or cream.\r\nThen, too, ice is largely purified in the process of freezing, although\r\nif secured from a polluted source, reliance should not be placed in the\r\nmethod of purification; for even freezing does not destroy all\r\nvegetating bacteria.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Olson. 24 Rept.

If milk is\r\nheated to 176 deg. F. (80 deg. C.) or above, this enzym is destroyed so\r\nthat the above reaction no longer takes place. If potassium iodid and\r\nstarch are added to unheated milk and the same treated with hydrogen\r\nperoxid, the decomposition of the latter agent releases oxygen which\r\nacts on the potassium salt, which in turn gives off free iodine that\r\nturns the starch blue.\r\n\r\n[4] McKay, N.

The\r\nresult of the introduction of these organisms often changes its\r\ncharacter materially as most bacteria cause the production of more or\r\nless pronounced fermentative processes. Under normal conditions, milk\r\nsours, i. e., develops lactic acid, but at times this more common\r\nfermentation may be replaced by other changes which are marked by the\r\nproduction of some other more or less undesirable flavor, odor or change\r\nin appearance.\r\n\r\nIn referring to these changes, it is usually customary to designate them\r\nafter the most prominent by-product formed, but it must be kept in mind\r\nthat generally some other decomposition products are usually produced.\r\nWhether the organisms producing this or that series of changes prevail\r\nor not depends upon the initial seeding, and the conditions under which\r\nthe milk is kept. Ordinarily, the lactic acid organisms grow so\r\nluxuriantly in the milk that they overpower all competitors and so\r\ndetermine the nature of the fermentation; but occasionally the milk\r\nbecomes infected with other types of bacteria in relatively large\r\nnumbers and the conditions may be especially suitable to the development\r\nof these forms, thereby modifying the course of the normal changes that\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nThe kinds of bacteria that find it possible to develop in milk may be\r\nincluded under two heads:\r\n\r\n1. Those which cause no appreciable change in the milk, either in taste,\r\nodor or appearance. While these are frequently designated as the inert\r\nbacteria, it must not be supposed that they have absolutely no effect on\r\nmilk. It is probably true in most cases that slight changes of a\r\nchemical nature are produced, but the nature of the changes do not\r\npermit of ready recognition.\r\n\r\n2. This class embraces all those organisms which, as a result of their\r\ngrowth, are capable of producing evident changes. These transformations\r\nmay be such as to affect the taste, as in the sour milk or in the bitter\r\nfermentations, or the odor, as in some of the fetid changes, or the\r\nappearance of the milk, as in the slimy and color changes later\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n~Souring of milk.~ Ordinarily if milk is allowed to stand for several days\r\nat ordinary temperatures it turns sour. This is due to the formation of\r\nlactic acid, which is produced by the decomposition of the milk-sugar.\r\nWhile this change is well nigh universal, it does not occur without a\r\npre-existing cause, and that is the presence of certain living bacterial\r\nforms. These organisms develop in milk with great rapidity, and the\r\ndecomposition changes that are noted in souring are due to the\r\nby-products of their development.\r\n\r\nThe milk-sugar undergoes fermentation, the chief product being lactic\r\nacid, although various other by-products, as other organic acids\r\n(acetic, formic and succinic), different alcohols and gaseous products,\r\nas CO_{2}, H, N and methane (CH_{4}) are produced in small amounts.\r\n\r\nIn this fermentation, the acidity begins to be evident to the taste when\r\nit reaches about 0.3 per cent., calculated as lactic acid. As the\r\nformation of acid goes on, the casein is precipitated and incipient\r\ncurdling or lobbering of the milk occurs. This begins to be apparent\r\nwhen the acidity is about 0.4 per cent., but the curd becomes more solid\r\nwith increasing acidity. The rapidity of curdling is also dependent upon\r\nthe temperature of the milk. Thus milk which at ordinary temperatures\r\nmight remain fluid often curdles when heated. The growth of the bacteria\r\nis continued until about 0.8 to 1.0 per cent. acid is formed, although\r\nthe maximum amount fluctuates considerably with different lactic acid\r\nspecies. Further formation then ceases even though all of the milk-sugar\r\nis not used up, because of the inability of the lactic bacteria to\r\ncontinue their growth in such acid solutions.\r\n\r\nAs this acidity is really in the milk serum, cream never develops so\r\nmuch acid as milk, because a larger proportion of its volume is made up\r\nof butter-fat globules. This fact must be considered in the ripening of\r\ncream in butter-making where the per cent. of fat is subject to wide\r\nfluctuations.\r\n\r\nThe formation of lactic acid is a characteristic that is possessed by a\r\nlarge number of bacteria, micrococci as well as bacilli being numerously\r\nrepresented. Still the preponderance of evidence is in favor of the view\r\nthat a few types are responsible for most of these changes. The most\r\ncommon type found in spontaneously soured milk changes the milk-sugar\r\ninto lactic acid without the production of any gas. This type has been\r\ndescribed by various workers on European as well as American milks, and\r\nis designated by Conn as the _Bact. lactis acidi_ type.[51] It is\r\nsubject to considerable variation under different conditions.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough if milk which has been drawn with special care is\r\nexamined immediately after milking, the lactic organisms are not usually\r\nfound. They are incapable of development in the udder itself, as shown\r\nby injections into the milk cistern. They abound, however, on hay, in\r\ndust, in the barn air, on the hairy coat of the animal, and from these\r\nsources easily gain access to the milk. In this medium they find an\r\nexceptionally favorable environment and soon begin a very rapid growth,\r\nso that by the time milk is consumed, either in the form of milk or milk\r\nproducts, they make up numerically the larger portion of the bacteria\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAnother widely disseminated, although numerically less prevalent, type\r\nis _B. lactis aerogenes_. This type forms gas in milk so that the soured\r\nmilk is torn by the presence of gas bubbles. It also grows more\r\nluxuriantly in contact with the air.\r\n\r\nOther types occur more or less sporadically, some of which are capable\r\nof liquefying the casein of milk while at the same time they also\r\ndevelop lactic acid. Conn and Aikman refer to the fact that over one\r\nhundred species capable of producing variable quantities of lactic acid\r\nare already known. It is fair to presume, however, that a careful\r\ncomparative study of these would show that simply racial differences\r\nexist in many cases, and therefore, that they are not distinct species.\r\n\r\nAs a group these bacteria are characterized by their inability to\r\nliquefy gelatin or develop spores. On account of this latter\r\ncharacteristic they are easily destroyed when milk is pasteurized. They\r\nlive under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, many of them being able to\r\ngrow in either environment, although, according to McDonnell,[52] they\r\nare more virulent when air is not excluded.\r\n\r\nWhile growth of these lactic forms may go on in milk throughout a\r\nrelatively wide range in temperature, appreciable quantities of acid are\r\nnot produced except very slowly at temperatures below 50 deg. F.[53]\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of frequency the most common abnormal changes that\r\noccur in milk are those in which gases of varying character are\r\ndeveloped in connection with acids, from the milk sugar. Other volatile\r\nproducts imparting bad flavors usually accompany gas production. These\r\nfermentations are of most serious import in the cheese industry, as they\r\nare especially prone to develop in the manufacture of milk into certain\r\ntypes of cheese. Not often is their development so rapid that they\r\nappear in the milk while it is yet in the hands of the milk producer,\r\nbut almost invariably the introduction of the causal organisms takes\r\nplace while the milk is on the farm. Numerous varieties of bacteria\r\npossess this property of producing gas (H and CO_{2} are most common\r\nalthough N and methane (CH_{4}) are sometimes produced). The more common\r\nforms are those represented by _B. lactis aerogenes_ and the common\r\nfecal type, _B. coli commune_. The ordinary habitat of this type is dirt\r\nand intestinal filth. Hence careless methods of milk handling invite\r\nthis type of abnormal change in milk.\r\n\r\nIt is a wide-spread belief that thunder storms cause milk to sour\r\nprematurely, but this idea has no scientific foundation. Experiments[54]\r\nwith the electric spark, ozone and loud detonations show no effect on\r\nacid development, but the atmospheric conditions usually incident to a\r\nthunder storm are such as permit of a more rapid growth of organisms.\r\nThere is no reason to believe but that the phenomenon of souring is\r\nwholly related to the development of bacteria. Sterile milks are never\r\naffected by the action of electric storms.\r\n\r\n~\"Gassy\" milks.~ Where these gas bacteria abound, the amount of lactic\r\nacid is generally reduced, due to the splitting up of some of the sugar\r\ninto gaseous products. This type of germ life does not seem to be able\r\nto develop well in the presence of the typical lactic acid non\r\ngas-forming bacteria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. Cheese made from \"gassy\" milk.]\r\n\r\n~\"Sweet curdling\" and digesting fermentations.~ Not infrequently milk,\r\ninstead of undergoing spontaneous souring, curdles in a weakly acid or\r\nneutral condition, in which state it is said to have undergone \"sweet\r\ncurdling.\" The coagulation of the milk is caused by the action of enzyms\r\nof a rennet type that are formed by the growth of various species of\r\nbacteria. Later the whey separates more or less perfectly from the curd,\r\nproducing a \"wheyed off\" condition. Generally the coagulum in these\r\ncases is soft and somewhat slimy. The curd usually diminishes in bulk,\r\ndue to the gradual digestion or peptonization of the casein by\r\nproteid-dissolving enzyms (tryptic type) that are also produced by the\r\nbacteria causing the change.\r\n\r\nA large number of bacteria possess the property of affecting milk in\r\nthis way. So far as known they are able to liquefy gelatin (also a\r\npeptonizing process) and form spores. The Tyrothrix type of bacteria (so\r\nnamed by Duclaux on account of the supposed relation to cheese ripening)\r\nbelongs to this class. The hay and potato forms are also digesters.\r\nOrganisms of this type are generally associated with filth and manure,\r\nand find their way into the milk from the accumulations on the coat of\r\nthe animal.\r\n\r\nConn[55] has separated the rennet enzym from bacterial cultures in a\r\nrelatively pure condition, while Fermi[56] has isolated the digestive\r\nferment from several species.\r\n\r\nDuclaux[57] has given to this digesting enzym the name _casease_ or\r\ncheese ferment. These isolated ferments when added to fresh milk possess\r\nthe power of causing the characteristic curdling and subsequent\r\ndigestion quite independent of cell development. The quantity of ferment\r\nproduced by different species differs materially in some cases. In these\r\ndigestive fermentations, the chemical transformations are profound, the\r\ncomplex proteid molecule being broken down into albumoses, peptones,\r\namido-acids (tyrosin and leucin) and ammonia as well as fatty acids.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently these fermentations gain the ascendency over the normal\r\nsouring change, but under ordinary conditions they are held in abeyance,\r\nalthough this type of bacteria is always present to some extent in milk.\r\nWhen the lactic acid bacteria are destroyed, as in boiled, sterilized\r\nor pasteurized milk, these rennet-producing, digesting species develop.\r\n\r\n~Butyric acid fermentations.~ The formation of butyric acid in milk which\r\nmay be recognized by the \"rancid butter\" odor is not infrequently seen\r\nin old, sour milk, and for a long time was thought to be a continuation\r\nof the lactic fermentation, but it is now believed that these organisms\r\nfind more favorable conditions for growth, not so much on account of the\r\nlactic acid formed as in the absence of dissolved oxygen in the milk\r\nwhich is consumed by the sour-milk organisms.\r\n\r\nMost of the butyric class of bacteria are spore-bearing, and hence they\r\nare frequently present in boiled or sterilized milk. The by-products\r\nformed in this series of changes are quite numerous. In most cases,\r\nbutyric acid is prominent, but in addition to this, other organic acids,\r\nas lactic, succinic, and acetic, are produced, likewise different\r\nalcohols. Concerning the chemical origin of butyric acid there is yet\r\nsome doubt. Duclaux[58] affirms that the fat, sugar and casein are all\r\ndecomposed by various forms. In some cases, the reaction of the milk is\r\nalkaline, with other species it may be neutral or acid. This type of\r\nfermentation has not received the study it deserves.\r\n\r\nIn milk these organisms are not of great importance, as this\r\nfermentation does not readily gain the ascendency over the lactic\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\n~Ropy or slimy milk.~ The viscosity of milk is often markedly increased\r\nover that which it normally possesses. The intensity of this abnormal\r\ncondition may vary much; in some cases the milk becoming viscous or\r\nslimy; in others stringing out into long threads, several feet in\r\nlength, as in Fig. 17. Two sets of conditions are responsible for these\r\nropy or slimy milks. The most common is where the milk is clotted or\r\nstringy when drawn, as in some forms of garget. This is generally due to\r\nthe presence of viscid pus, and is often accompanied by a bloody\r\ndischarge, such a condition representing an inflamed state of the udder.\r\nRopiness of this character is not usually communicable from one lot of\r\nmilk to another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. Ropy milk.]\r\n\r\nThe communicable form of ropy milk only appears after the milk has been\r\ndrawn from the udder for a day or so, and is caused by the development\r\nof various species of bacteria which find their way into the milk after\r\nit is drawn. These defects are liable to occur at any season of the\r\nyear. Their presence in a dairy is a source of much trouble, as the\r\nunsightly appearance of the milk precludes its use as food, although\r\nthere is no evidence that these ropy fermentations are dangerous to\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nThere are undoubtedly a number of different species of bacteria that are\r\ncapable of producing these viscid changes,[59] but it is quite probable\r\nthat they are not of equal importance in infecting milk under natural\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases studied in this country,[60] the causal\r\norganism seems to be _B. lactis viscosus_, a form first found by Adametz\r\nin surface waters.[61] This organism possesses the property of\r\ndeveloping at low temperatures (45 deg.-50 deg. F.), and consequently it\r\nis often able in winter to supplant the lactic-acid forms. Ward has found\r\nthis germ repeatedly in water tanks where milk cans are cooled; and\r\nunder these conditions it is easy to see how infection of the milk might\r\noccur. Marshall[62] reports an outbreak which he traced to an external\r\ninfection of the udder; in another case, the slime-forming organism was\r\nabundant in the barn dust. A defect of this character is often\r\nperpetuated in a dairy for some time, and may therefore become\r\nexceedingly troublesome. In one instance in the writer's experience, a\r\nmilk dealer lost over $150 a month for several months from ropy cream.\r\nFailure to properly sterilize cans, and particularly strainer cloths, is\r\nfrequently responsible for a continuance of trouble of this sort.\r\n\r\nThe slimy substance formed in milk comes from various constituents of\r\nthe milk, and the chemical character of the slime produced also varies\r\nwith different germs. In some cases the slimy material is merely the\r\nswollen outer cell membrane of the bacteria themselves as in the case of\r\n_B. lactis viscosus_; in others it is due to the decomposition of the\r\nproteids, but often the chief decomposition product appears to come from\r\na viscous fermentation of the milk-sugar.\r\n\r\nAn interesting case of a fermentation of this class being utilized in\r\ndairying is seen in the use of \"lange wei\" (long or stringy whey) which\r\nis employed as a starter in Holland to control the gassy fermentations\r\nin Edam cheese. This slimy change is due to the growth of\r\n_Streptococcus Hollandicus_.[63]\r\n\r\n~Alcoholic fermentations.~ Although glucose or cane-sugar solutions are\r\nextremely prone to undergo alcoholic fermentation, milk sugar does not\r\nreadily undergo this change. Where such changes are produced it is due\r\nto yeasts. Several outbreaks attributable to such a cause have been\r\nreported.[64] Russell and Hastings[65] have found these milk-sugar\r\nsplitting yeasts particularly abundant in regions where Swiss cheese is\r\nmade, a condition made possible by the use of whey-soaked rennets in\r\nmaking such cheese.\r\n\r\nKephir and Koumiss are liquors much used in the Orient which are made\r\nfrom milk that has undergone alcoholic fermentation. Koumiss was\r\noriginally made from mare's milk but is now often made from cows' milk\r\nby adding cane sugar and yeast. In addition to the CO_{2} developed,\r\nalcohol, lactic acid, and casein-dissolving ferments are formed. Kephir\r\nis made by adding to milk Kephir grains, which are a mass of yeast and\r\nbacterial cells. The yeasts produce alcohol and CO_{2} while the\r\nbacteria change the casein of milk, rendering it more digestible. These\r\nbeverages are frequently recommended to persons who seem to be unable to\r\ndigest raw milk readily. The exact nature of the changes produced are\r\nnot yet well understood.[66]\r\n\r\n~Bitter milk.~ The presence of bitter substances in milk may be ascribed\r\nto a variety of causes. A number of plants, such as lupines, ragweed and\r\nchicory, possess the property of affecting milk when the same are\r\nconsumed by animals. At certain stages in lactation, a bitter salty\r\ntaste is occasionally to be noted that is peculiar to individual\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of cases of bitter milk have, however, been traced\r\nto bacterial origin. For a number of years the bitter fermentation of\r\nmilk was thought to be associated with the butyric fermentation, but\r\nWeigmann[67] showed that the two conditions were not dependent upon each\r\nother. He found that the organism which produced the bitter taste acted\r\nupon the casein.\r\n\r\nConn[68] observed a coccus form in bitter cream that was able to impart\r\na bitter flavor to milk. Sometimes a bitter condition does not develop\r\nin the milk, but may appear later in the milk products, as in the case\r\nof a micrococcus which Freudenreich[69] found in cheese.\r\n\r\nHarrison[70] has traced a common bitter condition in Canadian milk to a\r\nmilk-sugar splitting yeast, _Torula amara_ which not only grows rapidly\r\nin milk but produces an undesirable bitterness in cheddar cheese.\r\n\r\nCream ripened at low temperatures not infrequently develops a bitter\r\nflavor, showing that the optimum temperature for this type of\r\nfermentation is below the typical lactic acid change.\r\n\r\nMilk that has been heated often develops a bitter condition. The\r\nexplanation of this is that the bacteria producing the bitter substances\r\nusually possess endospores, and that while the boiling or sterilizing of\r\nmilk easily kills the lactic acid germs, these forms on account of their\r\ngreater resisting powers are not destroyed by the heat.\r\n\r\n~Soapy milk:~ A soapy flavor in milk was traced by Weigmann and Zirn[71]\r\nto a specific bacillus, _B. lactis saponacei_, that they found gained\r\naccess to the milk in one case from the bedding and in another instance\r\nfrom hay. A similar outbreak has been reported in this country,[72] due\r\nto a germ acting on the casein and albumen.\r\n\r\n~Red milk.~ The most common trouble of this nature in milk is due to\r\npresence of blood, which is most frequently caused by some wound in the\r\nudder. The ingestion of certain plants as sedges and scouring rushes is\r\nalso said to cause a bloody condition; madders impart a reddish tinge\r\ndue to coloring matter absorbed. Defects of this class can be readily\r\ndistinguished from those due to germ growth because they are apparent at\r\ntime of milking. Where blood is actually present, the corpuscles settle\r\nout in a short time if left undisturbed.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of chromogenic or color-producing bacteria that are\r\nable to grow in milk, but their action is so slow that generally they\r\nare not of much consequence. Moreover their development is usually\r\nconfined to the surface of the milk as it stands in a vessel. The most\r\nimportant is the well-known _B. prodigiosus_. Another form found at\r\ntimes in milk possessing low acidity[73] is _B. lactis erythrogenes_.\r\nThis species only develops the red color in the dark. In the light, it\r\nforms a yellow pigment. Various other organisms have been reported at\r\ndifferent times.[74]\r\n\r\n~Blue milk.~ Blue milk has been known for many years, its communicable\r\nnature being established as long ago as 1838. It appears on the surface\r\nof milk first as isolated particles of bluish or grey color, which\r\nlater become confluent, the blue color increasing in intensity as the\r\nacidity increases. The causal organism, _B. cyanogenes_, is very\r\nresistant toward drying,[75] thus accounting for its persistence. In\r\nMecklenberg an outbreak of this sort once continued for several years.\r\nIt has frequently been observed in Europe in the past, but is not now so\r\noften reported. Occasional outbreaks have been reported in this country.\r\n\r\n~Other kinds of colored milk.~ Two or three chromogenic forms producing\r\nstill other colors have occasionally been found in milk. Adametz[76]\r\ndiscovered in a sample of cooked milk a peculiar form (_Bacillus\r\nsynxanthus_) that produced a citron-yellow appearance which precipitated\r\nand finally rendered soluble the casein. Adametz, Conn, and List have\r\ndescribed other species that confer tints of yellow on milk. Some of\r\nthese are bright lemon, others orange, and some amber in color.\r\n\r\nStill other color-producing bacteria, such as those that produce violet\r\nor green changes in the milk, have been observed. In fact, almost any of\r\nthe chromogenic bacteria are able to produce their color changes in milk\r\nas it is such an excellent food medium. Under ordinary conditions, these\r\ndo not gain access to milk in sufficient numbers so that they modify the\r\nappearance of it except in occasional instances.\r\n\r\n~Treatment of abnormal fermentations.~ If the taint is recognized as of\r\nbacterial origin (see p. 57) and is found in the mixed milk of the herd,\r\nit is necessary to ascertain, first, whether it is a general trouble, or\r\nrestricted to one or more animals. This can sometimes be done by\r\nseparating the milk of the different cows and noting whether any\r\nabnormal condition develops in the respective samples.\r\n\r\n~Fermentation tests.~ The most satisfactory way to detect the presence of\r\nthe taints more often present is to make a fermentation test of one kind\r\nor another. These tests are most frequently used at the factory, to\r\nenable the maker to detect the presence of milk that is likely to prove\r\nunfit for use, especially in cheese making. They are based upon the\r\nprinciple that if milk is held at a moderately high temperature, the\r\nbacteria will develop rapidly. A number of different methods have been\r\ndevised for this purpose. In Walther's lacto-fermentator samples of milk\r\nare simply allowed to stand in bottles or glass jars until they sour.\r\nThey are examined at intervals of several hours. If the curdled milk is\r\nhomogeneous and has a pure acid smell, the milk is regarded as all\r\nright. If it floats in a turbid serum, is full of gas or ragged holes,\r\nit is abnormal. As generally carried out, no attempt is made to have\r\nthese vessels sterile. Gerber's test is a similar test that has been\r\nextensively employed in Switzerland. Sometimes a few drops of rennet are\r\nadded to the milk so as to curdle the same, and thus permit of the more\r\nready detection of the gas that is evolved.\r\n\r\n~Wisconsin curd test.~ The method of testing milk described below was\r\ndevised at the Wisconsin Experiment Station in 1895 by Babcock, Russell\r\nand Decker.[77] It was used first in connection with experimental work\r\non the influence of gas-generating bacteria in cheese making, but its\r\napplicability to the detection of all taints in milk produced by\r\nbacteria makes it a valuable test for abnormal fermentations in general.\r\n\r\nIn the curd test a small pat of curd is made in a glass jar from each\r\nsample of milk. These tests may be made in any receptacle that has been\r\ncleaned in boiling water, and to keep the temperature more nearly\r\nuniform these jars should be immersed in warm water, as in a wash tub or\r\nsome other receptacle. When the milk is about 95 deg. F., about ten drops\r\nof rennet extract are added to each sample and mixed thoroughly with the\r\nmilk. The jars should then remain undisturbed until the milk is\r\ncompletely curdled; then the curd is cut into small pieces with a case\r\nknife and stirred to expel the whey. The whey should be poured off at\r\nfrequent intervals until the curd mats. If the sample be kept at blood\r\nheat (98 deg. F.) for six to eight hours, it will be ready to examine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. Improved bottles for making curd test. _A_, test\r\nbottle complete; _B_, bottle showing construction of cover; _S_, sieve\r\nto hold back the curd when bottle is inverted; _C_, outer cover with _(D\r\nH)_ drain holes to permit of removal of whey.]\r\n\r\nMore convenient types of this test than the improvised apparatus just\r\nalluded to have been devised by different dairy manufacturers.\r\nGenerally, they consist of a special bottle having a full-sized top,\r\nthus permitting the easy removal of the curd. The one shown in Fig. 18\r\nis provided with a sieve of such construction that the bottles will\r\ndrain thoroughly if inclined in an inverted position.\r\n\r\n~Interpretation of results of test.~ The curd from a good milk has a firm,\r\nsolid texture, and should contain at most only a few small pin holes. It\r\nmay have some large, irregular, \"mechanical\" holes where the curd\r\nparticles have failed to cement, as is seen in Fig. 19. If gas-producing\r\nbacteria are very prevalent in the milk, the conditions under which the\r\ntest is made cause such a rapid growth of the same that the evidence of\r\nthe abnormal fermentation may be readily seen in the spongy texture of\r\nthe curd (Fig. 20). If the undesirable organisms are not very abundant\r\nand the conditions not especially suited to their growth, the \"pin\r\nholes\" will be less frequent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. Curd from a good milk. The large irregular holes\r\nare mechanical.]\r\n\r\nSometimes the curds show no evidence of gas, but their abnormal\r\ncondition can be recognized by the \"mushy\" texture and the presence of\r\n\"off\" flavors that are rendered more apparent by keeping them in closed\r\nbottles. This condition is abnormal and is apt to produce quite as\r\nserious results as if gas was formed.\r\n\r\n~Overcoming taints by use of starters.~ Another method of combatting\r\nabnormal fermentations that is often fruitful, is that which rests upon\r\nthe inability of one kind of bacteria to grow in the same medium in\r\ncompetition with certain other species.\r\n\r\nSome of the undesirable taints in factories can be controlled in large\r\npart by the introduction of starters made from certain organisms that\r\nare able to obtain the ascendency over the taint-producing germ. Such a\r\nmethod is commonly followed when a lactic ferment, either a commercial\r\npure culture, or a home-made starter, is added to milk to overcome the\r\neffect of gas-generating bacteria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. Curd from a badly tainted milk. Large ragged\r\nholes are mechanical; numerous small holes due to gas. This curd was a\r\n\"floater.\"]\r\n\r\nA similar illustration is seen in the case of the \"lange wei\" (slimy\r\nwhey), that is used in the manufacture of Edam cheese to control the\r\ncharacter of the fermentation of the milk.\r\n\r\nThis same method is sometimes applied in dealing with certain abnormal\r\nfermentations that are apt to occur on the farm. It is particularly\r\nuseful with those tainted milks known as \"sweet curdling.\" The ferment\r\norganisms concerned in this change are unable to develop in the\r\npresence of lactic acid bacteria, so the addition of a clean sour milk\r\nas a starter restores the normal conditions by giving the ordinary milk\r\nbacteria the ascendency.\r\n\r\n~Chemical disinfection.~ In exceptional instances it may be necessary to\r\nemploy chemical disinfectants to restore the normal conditions. Of\r\ncourse with such diseases as tuberculosis, very stringent measures are\r\nrequired, as they are such a direct menace to human life, but with these\r\nabnormal or taint-producing fermentations, care and cleanliness, well\r\ndirected, will usually overcome the trouble.\r\n\r\nIf it becomes necessary to employ chemical substances as disinfecting\r\nagents, their use should always be preceded by a thorough cleansing with\r\nhot water so that the germicide may come in direct contact with the\r\nsurface to be disinfected.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that many chemicals act as deodorants, _i.e._,\r\ndestroy the offensive odor, without destroying the cause of the trouble.\r\n\r\n_Sulfur_ is often recommended as a disinfecting agent, but its use\r\nshould be carefully controlled, otherwise the vapors have but little\r\ngermicidal power. The common practice of burning a small quantity in a\r\nroom or any closed space for a few moments has little or no effect upon\r\ngerm life. The effect of sulfur vapor (SO_{2}) alone upon germ life is\r\nrelatively slight, but if this gas is produced in the presence of\r\nmoisture, sulfurous acid (H_{2}SO_{3}) is formed, which is much more\r\nefficient. To use this agent effectively, it must be burned in large\r\nquantities in a moist atmosphere (three lbs. to every 1,000 cubic feet\r\nof space), for at least twelve hours. After this operation, the space\r\nshould be thoroughly aired.\r\n\r\n_Formalin_, a watery solution of a gas known as formaldehyde, is a new\r\ndisinfectant that recent experience has demonstrated to be very useful.\r\nIt may be used as a gas where rooms are to be disinfected, or applied as\r\na liquid where desired. It is much more powerful in its action than\r\nsulfur, and it has a great advantage over mercury and other strong\r\ndisinfectants, as it is not so poisonous to man as it is to the lower\r\nforms of life.\r\n\r\n_Bleaching powder or chloride of lime_ is often recommended where a\r\nchemical can be advantageously used. This substance is a good\r\ndisinfectant as well as a deodorant, and if applied as a wash, in the\r\nproportion of four to six ounces of the powder to one gallon of water,\r\nit will destroy most forms of life. In many cases this agent is\r\ninapplicable on account of its odor.\r\n\r\n_Corrosive sublimate_ (HgCl_{2}) for most purposes is a good\r\ndisinfectant, but it is such an intense poison that its use is dangerous\r\nin places that are at all accessible to stock.\r\n\r\nFor the disinfection of walls in stables and barns, common thin _white\r\nwash_ Ca(OH)_{2} is admirably adapted if made from freshly-burned quick\r\nlime. It possesses strong germicidal powers, increases the amount of\r\nlight in the barn, is a good absorbent of odors, and is exceedingly\r\ncheap.\r\n\r\nCarbolic acid, creosote, and such products, while excellent\r\ndisinfectants, cannot well be used on account of their odor, especially\r\nin factories.\r\n\r\nFor gutters, drains, and waste pipes in factories, _vitriol salts_\r\n(sulfates of copper, iron and zinc) are sometimes used. These are\r\ndeodorants as well as disinfectants, and are not so objectionable to use\r\non account of their odor.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions as to the use of chemicals, however, only apply to\r\nextreme cases and should not be brought into requisition until a\r\nthorough application of hot water, soap, a little soda, and the\r\nscrubbing brush have failed to do their work.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[51] Guenther and Thierfelder, Arch. f.

Attention has been prominently called to\r\nthis relation by Ernest Hart,[78] who in 1880 compiled statistical\r\nevidence showing the numerous outbreaks of various contagious diseases\r\nthat had been associated with milk infection up to that time. Since\r\nthen, further compilations have been made by Freeman,[79] and also by\r\nBusey and Kober,[80] who have collected the data with reference to\r\noutbreaks from 1880 to 1899.\r\n\r\nThese statistics indicate the relative importance of milk as a factor in\r\nthe dissemination of disease.\r\n\r\nThe danger from this source is much intensified for the reason that\r\nmilk, generally speaking, is consumed in a raw state; and also because a\r\nconsiderable number of disease-producing bacteria are able, not merely\r\nto exist, but actually thrive and grow in milk, even though the normal\r\nmilk bacteria are also present. Moreover the recognition of the presence\r\nof such pathogenic forms is complicated by the fact that often they do\r\nnot alter the appearance of the milk sufficiently so that their\r\npresence can be detected by a physical examination. These facts which\r\nhave been experimentally determined, coupled with the numerous clinical\r\ncases on record, make a strong case against milk serving as an agent in\r\nthe dissemination of disease.\r\n\r\n~Origin of pathogenic bacteria in milk.~ Disease-producing bacteria may be\r\ngrouped with reference to their relation toward milk into two classes,\r\ndepending upon the manner in which infection occurs:\r\n\r\nClass I. Disease-producing bacteria capable of being transmitted\r\ndirectly from a diseased animal to man through the medium of infected\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nClass II. Bacteria pathogenic for man but not for cattle which are\r\ncapable of thriving in milk after it is drawn from the animal.\r\n\r\nIn the first group the disease produced by the specific organism must be\r\ncommon to both cattle and man. The organism must live a parasitic life\r\nin the animal, developing in the udder, and so infect the milk supply.\r\nIt may, of course, happen that diseases toward which domestic animals\r\nalone are susceptible may be spread from one animal to another in this\r\nway without affecting human beings.\r\n\r\nIn the second group, the bacterial species lives a saprophytic\r\nexistence, growing in milk, if it happens to find its way therein. In\r\nsuch cases milk indirectly serves as an agent in the dissemination of\r\ndisease, by giving conditions favorable to the growth of the disease\r\ngerm.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important of diseases that may be transmitted directly\r\nfrom animal to man through a diseased milk supply is tuberculosis, but\r\nin addition to this, foot and mouth disease (aphthous fever in\r\nchildren), anthrax and acute enteric troubles have also been traced to a\r\nsimilar source of infection.\r\n\r\nThe most important specific diseases that have been disseminated through\r\nsubsequent pollution of the milk are typhoid fever, diphtheria, scarlet\r\nfever and cholera, but, of course, the possibility exists that any\r\ndisease germ capable of living and thriving in milk may be spread in\r\nthis way. In addition to these diseases that are caused by the\r\nintroduction of specific organisms (the causal organism of scarlet fever\r\nhas not yet been definitely determined), there are a large number of\r\nmore or less illy-defined troubles of an intestinal character that occur\r\nespecially in infants and young children that are undoubtedly\r\nattributable to the activity of microorganisms that gain access to milk\r\nduring and subsequent to the milking, and which produce changes in milk\r\nbefore or after its ingestion that result in the formation of toxic\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES TRANSMISSIBLE FROM ANIMAL TO MAN THROUGH DISEASED MILK.\r\n\r\n~Tuberculosis.~ In view of the wide-spread distribution of this disease in\r\nboth the human and the bovine race, the relation of the same to milk\r\nsupplies is a question of great importance. It is now generally admitted\r\nthat the different types of tubercular disease found in different kinds\r\nof animals and man are attributable to the development of the same\r\norganism, _Bacillus tuberculosis_, although there are varieties of this\r\norganism found in different species of animals that are sufficiently\r\ndistinct to permit of recognition.\r\n\r\nThe question of prime importance is, whether the bovine type is\r\ntransmissible to the human or not. Artificial inoculation of cattle with\r\ntuberculous human sputum as well as pure cultures of this variety show\r\nthat the human type is able to make but slight headway in cattle. This\r\nwould indicate that the danger of cattle acquiring the infection from\r\nman would in all probability be very slight, but these experiments offer\r\nno answer as to the possibility of transmission from the bovine to the\r\nhuman. Manifestly it is impossible to solve this problem by direct\r\nexperiment upon man except by artificial inoculation, but comparative\r\nexperiments upon animals throw some light on the question.\r\n\r\nTheo. Smith[81] and others[82] have made parallel experiments with\r\nanimals such as guinea pigs, rabbits and pigeons, inoculated with both\r\nbovine and human cultures of this organism. The results obtained in the\r\ncase of all animals tested show that the virulence of the two types was\r\nmuch different, but that the bovine cultures were much more severe.\r\nWhile of course this does not prove that transmission from bovine to\r\nhuman is possible, still the importance of the fact must not be\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\nIn a number of cases record of accidental infection from cattle to man\r\nhas been noted.[83] These have occurred with persons engaged in making\r\npost-mortem examinations on tuberculous animals, and the tubercular\r\nnature of the wound was proven in some cases by excision and\r\ninoculation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to data of this sort that is practically experimental in\r\ncharacter, there are also strong clinical reasons for considering that\r\ninfection of human beings may occur through the medium of milk.\r\nNaturally such infection should produce intestinal tuberculosis, and it\r\nis noteworthy that this phase of the disease is quite common in\r\nchildren especially between the ages of two and five.[84] It is\r\ndifficult to determine, though, whether primary infection occurred\r\nthrough the intestine, for, usually, other organs also become involved.\r\nIn a considerable number of cases in which tubercular infection by the\r\nmost common channel, inhalation, seems to be excluded, the evidence is\r\nstrong that the disease was contracted through the medium of the milk,\r\nbut it is always very difficult to exclude the possibility of pulmonary\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nTuberculosis as a bovine disease has increased rapidly during recent\r\ndecades throughout many portions of the world. This has been most marked\r\nin dairy regions. Its extremely insidious nature does not permit of an\r\nearly recognition by physical means, and it was not until the\r\nintroduction of the tuberculin test[85] in 1892, as a diagnostic aid\r\nthat accurate knowledge of its distribution was possible. The quite\r\ngeneral introduction of this test in many regions has revealed an\r\nalarmingly large percentage of animals as affected. In Denmark in 1894\r\nover forty per cent were diagnosed as tubercular. In some parts of\r\nGermany almost as bad a condition has been revealed. Slaughter-house\r\nstatistics also show that the disease has increased rapidly since 1890.\r\nIn this country the disease on the average is much less than in Europe\r\nand is also very irregularly distributed. In herds where it gained a\r\nfoothold some years ago, often the majority of animals are frequently\r\ninfected; many herds, in fact the great majority, are wholly free from\r\nall taint. The disease has undoubtedly been most frequently introduced\r\nthrough the purchase of apparently healthy but incipiently affected\r\nanimals. Consequently in the older dairy regions where stock has been\r\nimproved the most by breeding, more of the disease exists than among the\r\nwestern and southern cattle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration FIG. 21: Front view of a tuberculous udder, showing extent\r\nof swelling in single quarter.]\r\n\r\n~Infectiousness of milk of reacting animals.~ Where the disease appears in\r\nthe udder the milk almost invariably contains the tubercle organism.\r\nUnder such conditions the appearance of the milk is not materially\r\naltered at first, but as the disease progresses the percentage of fat\r\ngenerally diminishes, and at times in the more advanced stages where the\r\nphysical condition of the udder is changed (Fig. 21), the milk may\r\nbecome \"watery\"; but the percentage of animals showing such udder\r\nlesions is not large, usually not more than a few per cent. (4 per cent.\r\naccording to Ostertag.)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the earlier phases of the disease, where its\r\npresence has been recognized solely by the aid of the tuberculin test,\r\nbefore there are any recognizable physical symptoms in any part of the\r\nanimal, the milk is generally unaffected. Between these extremes,\r\nhowever, is found a large proportion of cases, concerning which so\r\ndefinite data are not available. The results of investigators on this\r\npoint are conflicting and further information is much desired. Some have\r\nasserted so long as the udder itself shows no lesions that no tubercle\r\nbacilli would be present,[86] but the findings of a considerable number\r\nof investigators[87] indicate that even when the udder is apparently not\r\ndiseased the milk may contain the specific organism as revealed by\r\ninoculation experiments upon animals. In some cases, however, it has\r\nbeen demonstrated by post-mortem examination that discoverable udder\r\nlesions existed that were not recognizable before autopsy was made. In\r\nthe experimental evidence collected, a varying percentage of reacting\r\nanimals were found that gave positive results; and this number was\r\ngenerally sufficient to indicate that the danger of using milk from\r\nreacting animals was considerable, even though apparently no disease\r\ncould be found in the udder.\r\n\r\nThe infectiousness of milk can also be proven by the frequent\r\ncontraction of the disease in other animals, such as calves and pigs\r\nwhich may be fed on the skim milk. The very rapid increase of the\r\ndisease among the swine of Germany and Denmark,[88] and the frequently\r\nreported cases of intestinal infection of young stock also attest the\r\npresence of the organism in milk.\r\n\r\nThe tubercle bacillus is so markedly parasitic in its habits, that,\r\nunder ordinary conditions, it is incapable of growing at normal air\r\ntemperatures. There is, therefore, no danger of the germ developing in\r\nmilk after it is drawn from the animal, unless the same is kept at\r\npractically blood heat.\r\n\r\nEven though the milk of some reacting animals may not contain the\r\ndangerous organism at the time of making the test, it is quite\r\nimpossible to foretell how long it will remain free. As the disease\r\nbecomes more generalized, or if tuberculous lesions should develop in\r\nthe udder, the milk may pass from a healthy to an infectious state.\r\n\r\nThis fact makes it advisable to exclude from milk supplies intended for\r\nhuman use, all milk of animals that respond to the tuberculin test; or\r\nat least to treat it in a manner so as to render it safe. Whether it is\r\nnecessary to do this or not if the milk is made into butter or cheese is\r\na somewhat different question. Exclusion or treatment is rendered more\r\nimperative in milk supplies, because the danger is greater with children\r\nwith whom milk is often a prominent constituent of their diet, and also\r\nfor the reason that the child is more susceptible to intestinal\r\ninfection than the adult.\r\n\r\nThe danger of infection is much lessened in butter or cheese, because\r\nthe processes of manufacture tend to diminish the number of organisms\r\noriginally present in the milk, and inasmuch as no growth can ordinarily\r\ntake place in these products the danger is minimized. Moreover, the fact\r\nthat these foods are consumed by the individual in smaller amounts than\r\nis generally the case where milk is used, and also to a greater extent\r\nby adults, lessens still further the danger of infection.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, numerous observers[89] especially in Germany have\r\nsucceeded in finding the tubercle bacillus in market butter, but this\r\nfact is not so surprising when it is remembered that a very large\r\nfraction of their cattle show the presence of the disease as indicated\r\nby the tuberculin test, a condition that does not obtain in any large\r\nsection in this country.\r\n\r\nThe observations on the presence of the tubercle bacillus in butter have\r\nbeen questioned somewhat of late[2] by the determination of the fact\r\nthat butter may contain an organism that possesses the property of being\r\nstained in the same way as the tubercle organism. Differentiation\r\nbetween the two forms is rendered more difficult by the fact that this\r\ntubercle-like organism is also capable of producing in animals lesions\r\nthat stimulate those of tuberculosis, although a careful examination\r\nreveals definite differences. Petri[90] has recently determined that\r\nboth the true tubercle and the acid-resisting butter organism may be\r\nreadily found in market butter.\r\n\r\nIn the various milk products it has been experimentally determined that\r\nthe true tubercle bacillus is able to retain its vitality in butter for\r\na number of months and in cheese for nearly a year.\r\n\r\n~Treatment of milk from tuberculosis cows.~ While it has been shown that\r\nit is practically impossible to foretell whether the milk of any\r\nreacting animal actually contains tubercle bacilli or not, still the\r\ninterests of public health demand that no milk from such stock be used\r\nfor human food until it has been rendered safe by some satisfactory\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n_1. Heating._ By far the best treatment that can be given such milk is\r\nto heat it. The temperature at which this should be done depends upon\r\nthe thermal death point of the tubercle bacillus, a question concerning\r\nwhich there has been considerable difference of opinion until very\r\nrecently. According to the work of some of the earlier investigators,\r\nthe tubercle bacillus in its vegetative stage is endowed with powers of\r\nresistance greater than those possessed by any other pathogenic\r\norganism. This work has not been substantiated by the most recent\r\ninvestigations on this subject. In determining the thermal death point\r\nof this organism, as of any other, not only must the temperature be\r\nconsidered, but the period of exposure as well, and where that exposure\r\nis made in milk, another factor must be considered, viz., the presence\r\nof conditions permitting of the formation of a \"scalded layer,\" for as\r\nSmith[91] first pointed out, the resistance of the tubercle organism\r\ntoward heat is greatly increased under these conditions. If tuberculous\r\nmilk is heated in a closed receptacle where this scalded membrane cannot\r\nbe produced, the tubercle bacillus is killed at 140 deg. F. in 15 to 20\r\nminutes. These results which were first determined by Smith, under\r\nlaboratory conditions, and confirmed by Russell and Hastings,[92] where\r\ntuberculous milk was heated in commercial pasteurizers, have also been\r\nverified by Hesse.[93] A great practical advantage which accrues from\r\nthe treatment of milk at 140 deg. F. is that the natural creaming is\r\npractically unaffected. Of course, where a higher temperature is\r\nemployed, the period of exposure may be materially lessened. If milk is\r\nmomentarily heated to 176 deg. F., it is certainly sufficient to destroy\r\nthe tubercle bacillus. This is the plan practiced in Denmark where all\r\nskim milk and whey must be heated to this temperature before it can be\r\ntaken back to the farm, a plan which is designed to prevent the\r\ndissemination of tuberculosis and foot and mouth disease by means of the\r\nmixed creamery by-products. This course renders it possible to utilize\r\nwith perfect safety, for milk supplies, the milk of herds reacting to the\r\ntuberculin test, and as butter of the best quality can be made from\r\ncream or milk heated to even high temperatures,[94] it thus becomes\r\npossible to prevent with slight expense what would otherwise entail a\r\nlarge loss.\r\n\r\n_2. Dilution._ Another method that has been suggested for the treatment\r\nof this suspected milk is dilution with a relatively large volume of\r\nperfectly healthy milk. It is a well known fact that to produce\r\ninfection, it requires the simultaneous introduction of a number of\r\norganisms, and in the case of tuberculosis, especially that produced by\r\ningestion, this number is thought to be considerable. Gebhardt[95] found\r\nthat the milk of tuberculous cows, which was virulent when injected by\r\nitself into animals, was innocuous when diluted with 40 to 100 times its\r\nvolume of healthy milk. This fact is hardly to be relied upon in\r\npractice, unless the proportion of reacting to healthy cows is\r\npositively known.\r\n\r\nIt has also been claimed in the centrifugal separation of cream from\r\nmilk[96] that by far the larger number of tubercle bacilli were thrown\r\nout with the separator slime. Moore[97] has shown that the tubercle\r\nbacilli in an artificially infected milk might be reduced in this way,\r\nso as to be no longer microscopically demonstrable, yet the purification\r\nwas not complete enough to prevent the infection of animals inoculated\r\nwith the milk.\r\n\r\nAnother way to exclude all possibility of tubercular infection in milk\r\nsupplies is to reject all milk from reacting animals. This method is\r\noften followed where pasteurization or sterilization is not desired. In\r\ndairies where the keeping quality is dependent upon the exclusion of\r\nbacteria by stringent conditions as to milking and handling (\"sanitary\"\r\nor \"hygienic\" milk), the tuberculin test is frequently used as a basis\r\nto insure healthy milk.\r\n\r\n~Foot and mouth disease.~ The wide-spread extension of this disease\r\nthroughout Europe in recent years has given abundant opportunity to show\r\nthat while it is distinctively an animal malady, it is also\r\ntransmissible to man, although the disease is rarely fatal. The causal\r\norganism has not been determined with certainty, but it has been shown\r\nthat the milk of affected animals possesses infectious properties[98]\r\nalthough appearing unchanged in earlier phases of the disease.\r\n\r\nHertwig showed the direct transmissibility of the disease to man by\r\nexperiments made on himself and others. By ingesting milk from an\r\naffected animal, he was able to produce the symptoms of the disease, the\r\nmucous membrane of the mouth being covered with the small vesicles that\r\ncharacterize the malady. It has also been shown that the virus of the\r\ndisease may be conveyed in butter.[99] This disease is practically\r\nunknown in this country, although widely spread in Europe.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other bovine diseases such as anthrax,[100]\r\nlockjaw,[101] and hydrophobia[102] in which it has been shown that the\r\nvirus of the disease is at times to be found in the milk supply, but\r\noften the milk becomes visibly affected, so that the danger of using the\r\nsame is greatly minimized.\r\n\r\nThere are also a number of inflammatory udder troubles known as garget\r\nor mammitis. In most of these, the physical appearance of the milk is so\r\nchanged, and often pus is present to such a degree as to give a very\r\ndisagreeable appearance to the milk. Pus-forming bacteria (staphylococci\r\nand streptococci) are to be found associated with such troubles. A\r\nnumber of cases of gastric and intestinal catarrh have been reported as\r\ncaused by such milks.[103]\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES TRANSMISSIBLE TO MAN THROUGH INFECTION OF MILK AFTER\r\nWITHDRAWAL.\r\n\r\nMilk is so well adapted to the development of bacteria in general, that\r\nit is not surprising to find it a suitable medium for the growth of many\r\npathogenic species even at ordinary temperatures. Not infrequently,\r\ndisease-producing bacteria are able to grow in raw milk in competition\r\nwith the normal milk bacteria, so that even a slight contamination may\r\nsuffice to produce infection.\r\n\r\nThe diseases that are most frequently disseminated in this way are\r\ntyphoid fever, diphtheria, scarlet fever and cholera, together with the\r\nvarious illy-defined intestinal troubles of a toxic character that occur\r\nin children, especially under the name of cholera infantum, summer\r\ncomplaint, etc.\r\n\r\nDiseases of this class are not derived directly from animals because\r\ncattle are not susceptible to the same.\r\n\r\n~Modes of infection.~ In a variety of ways, however, the milk may be\r\nsubject to contaminating influences after it is drawn from the animal,\r\nand so give opportunity for the development of disease-producing\r\nbacteria. The more important methods of infection are as follows:\r\n\r\n_1. Infection directly from a pre-existing case of disease on premises._\r\nQuite frequently a person in the early stage of a diseased condition may\r\ncontinue at his usual vocation as helper in the barn or dairy, and so\r\ngive opportunity for direct infection to occur. In the so-called cases\r\nof \"walking typhoid,\" this danger is emphasized. It is noteworthy in\r\ntyphoid fever that the bacilli frequently persist in the urine and in\r\ndiphtheria they often remain in the throat until after convalescence. In\r\nsome cases infection has been traced to storage of the milk in rooms in\r\nthe house where it became polluted directly by the emanations of the\r\npatient.[104] Among the dwellings of the lower classes where a single\r\nroom has to be used in common this source of infection has been most\r\nfrequently observed.\r\n\r\n_2. Infection through the medium of another person._ Not infrequently\r\nanother individual may serve in the capacity of nurse or attendant to a\r\nsick person, and also assist in the handling of the milk, either in\r\nmilking the animals or caring for the milk after it has been drawn.\r\nBusey and Kober report twenty-one outbreaks of typhoid fever in which\r\ndairy employees also acted in the capacity of nurses.\r\n\r\n_3. Pollution of milk utensils._ The most frequent method of infection\r\nof cans, pails, etc., is in cleaning them with water that may be\r\npolluted with disease organisms. Often wells may be contaminated with\r\ndiseased matter of intestinal origin, as in typhoid fever, and the use\r\nof water at normal temperatures, or even in a lukewarm condition, give\r\nconditions permitting of infection. Intentional adulteration of milk\r\nwith water inadvertently taken from polluted sources has caused quite a\r\nnumber of typhoid outbreaks.[105] Sedgwick and Chapin[106] found in the\r\nSpringfield, Mass., epidemic of typhoid that the milk cans were placed\r\nin a well to cool the milk, and it was subsequently shown that the well\r\nwas polluted with typhoid fecal matter.\r\n\r\n_4. Pollution of udder_ of animal _by wading in infected water_, or by\r\nwashing same with contaminated water. This method of infection would\r\nonly be likely to occur in case of typhoid. An outbreak at the\r\nUniversity of Virginia in 1893[107] was ascribed to the latter cause.\r\n\r\n_5. Pollution of creamery by-products, skim-milk, etc._ Where the milk\r\nsupply of one patron becomes infected with pathogenic bacteria, it is\r\npossible that disease may be disseminated through the medium of the\r\ncreamery, the infective agent remaining in the skim milk after\r\nseparation and so polluting the mixed supply. This condition is more\r\nlikely to prevail with typhoid because of the greater tolerance of this\r\norganism for acids such as would be found in raw milk. The outbreaks at\r\nBrandon,[108] England, in 1893, Castle Island,[109] Ireland, and\r\nMarlboro,[110] Mass., in 1894, were traced to such an origin.\r\n\r\nWhile most outbreaks of disease associated with a polluted milk supply\r\noriginate in the use of the milk itself, yet infected milk may serve to\r\ncause disease even when used in other ways. Several outbreaks of typhoid\r\nfever have been traced to the use of ice cream where there were strong\r\nreasons for believing that the milk used in the manufacture of the\r\nproduct was polluted.[111] Hankin[112] details a case of an Indian\r\nconfection made largely from milk that caused a typhoid outbreak in a\r\nBritish regiment.\r\n\r\nAlthough the evidence that milk may not infrequently serve as an agent\r\nin spreading disease is conclusive enough to satisfactorily prove the\r\nproposition, yet it should be borne in mind that the organism of any\r\nspecific disease in question has rarely ever been found. The reasons for\r\nthis are quite the same as those that govern the situation in the case\r\nof polluted waters, except that the difficulties of the problem are much\r\ngreater in the case of milk than with water. The inability to readily\r\nseparate the typhoid germ, for instance, from the colon bacillus, an\r\norganism frequently found in milk, presents technical difficulties not\r\neasily overcome. The most potent reason of failure to find disease\r\nbacteria is the fact that infection in any case must occur sometime\r\nprevious to the appearance of the outbreak. Not only is there the usual\r\nperiod of incubation, but it rarely happens that an outbreak is\r\ninvestigated until a number of cases have occurred. In this interim the\r\noriginal cause of infection may have ceased to be operative.\r\n\r\n~Typhoid fever.~ With reference to the diseases likely to to be\r\ndisseminated through the medium of milk, infected after being drawn from\r\nthe animal, typhoid fever is the most important. The reason for this is\r\ndue (1) to the wide spread distribution of the disease; (2) to the fact\r\nthat the typhoid bacillus is one that is capable of withstanding\r\nconsiderable amounts of acid, and consequently finds even in raw milk\r\ncontaining the normal lactic acid bacteria conditions favorable for its\r\ngrowth.[113] Ability to grow under these conditions can be shown not\r\nonly experimentally, but there is abundant clinical evidence that even a\r\nslight infection often causes extensive outbreaks, as in the Stamford,\r\nConn., outbreak in 1895 where 386 cases developed in a few weeks, 97 per\r\ncent. of which occurred on the route of one milk-man. In this case the\r\nmilk cans were thoroughly and properly cleaned, but were rinsed out with\r\n_cold_ water from a shallow well that was found to be polluted.\r\n\r\nThe most common mode of pollution of milk with typhoid organisms is\r\nwhere the milk utensils are infected in one way or another.[114] Second\r\nin importance is the carrying of infection by persons serving in the\r\ndual capacity of nurse and dairy attendant.\r\n\r\n~Cholera.~ This germ does not find milk so favorable a nutrient medium as\r\nthe typhoid organism, because it is much more sensitive toward the\r\naction of acids. Kitasato[115] found, however, that it could live in\r\nraw milk from one to four days, depending upon the amount of acid\r\npresent. In boiled or sterilized milk it grows more freely, as the\r\nacid-producing forms are thereby eliminated. In butter it dies out in a\r\nfew days (4 to 5).\r\n\r\nOn account of the above relation not a large number of cholera outbreaks\r\nhave been traced to milk, but Simpson[116] records a very striking case\r\nin India where a number of sailors, upon reaching port, secured a\r\nquantity of milk. Of the crew which consumed this, every one was taken\r\nill, and four out of ten died, while those who did not partake escaped\r\nwithout any disease. It was later shown that the milk was adulterated\r\nwith water taken from an open pool in a cholera infected district.\r\n\r\n~Diphtheria.~ Milk occasionally, though not often, serves as a medium for\r\nthe dissemination of diphtheria. Swithinbank and Newman[117] cites four\r\ncases in which the causal organism has been isolated from milk. It has\r\nbeen observed that growth occurs more rapidly in raw than in sterilized\r\nmilk.[118]\r\n\r\nInfection in this disease is more frequently attributable to direct\r\ninfection from patient on account of the long persistence of this germ\r\nin the throat, or indirectly through the medium of an attendant.\r\n\r\n~Scarlet fever.~ Although it is more difficult to study the relation of\r\nthis disease to contaminated milk supplies, because the causal germ of\r\nscarlet fever is not yet known, yet the origin of a considerable number\r\nof epidemics has been traced to polluted milk supplies. Milk doubtless\r\nis infected most frequently from persons in the earlier stages of the\r\ndisease when the infectivity of the disease is greater.\r\n\r\n~Diarrhoeal diseases.~ Milk not infrequently acquires the property of\r\nproducing diseases of the digestive tract by reason of the development\r\nof various bacteria that form more or less poisonous by-products. These\r\ntroubles occur most frequently during the summer months, especially with\r\ninfants and children, as in cholera infantum and summer complaint. The\r\nhigher mortality of bottle-fed infants[119] in comparison with those\r\nthat are nursed directly is explicable on the theory that cows' milk is\r\nthe carrier of the infection, because in many cases it is not consumed\r\nuntil there has been ample time for the development of organisms in it.\r\nWhere milk is pasteurized or boiled it is found that the mortality among\r\nchildren is greatly reduced. As a cause of sickness and death these\r\ndiseases exceed in importance all other specific diseases previously\r\nreferred to. These troubles have generally been explained as produced by\r\nbacteria of the putrefactive class which find their way into the milk\r\nthrough the introduction of filth and dirt at time of milking.[120]\r\nFluegge[121] has demonstrated that certain peptonizing species possess\r\ntoxic properties for animals. Recent experimental inquiry[122] has\r\ndemonstrated that the dysentery bacillus (Shiga) probably bears a causal\r\nrelation to some of these summer complaints.\r\n\r\n~Ptomaine poisoning.~ Many cases of poisoning from food products are also\r\nreported with adults. These are due to the formation of various toxic\r\nproducts, generally ptomaines, that are produced as a result of\r\ninfection of foods by different bacteria. One of these substances,\r\n_tyrotoxicon_, was isolated by Vaughan[123] from cheese and various\r\nother products of milk, and found to possess the property of producing\r\nsymptoms of poisoning similar to those that are noted in such cases. He\r\nattributes the production of this toxic effect to the decomposition of\r\nthe elements in the milk induced by putrefactive forms of bacteria that\r\ndevelop where milk is improperly kept.[124] Often outbreaks of this\r\ncharacter[125] assume the proportions of an epidemic, where a large\r\nnumber of persons use the tainted food.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[78] Hart, Trans.

None of the organisms that find their way into milk, nor the\r\nby-products formed by their growth, improve the quality of milk\r\nsupplies. It is therefore especially desirable from the milk-dealer's\r\npoint of view that these changes should be held in abeyance as much as\r\npossible. Then too, the possibility that milk may serve as a medium for\r\nthe dissemination of disease-breeding bacteria makes it advisable to\r\nprotect this food supply from all possible infection from suspicious\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nIn considering, therefore, the relation of bacteria to general milk\r\nsupplies, the _economic_ and the _hygienic_ standpoints must be taken\r\ninto consideration. Ordinarily much more emphasis is laid upon the first\r\nrequirement. If the supply presents no abnormal feature as to taste,\r\nodor and appearance, unfortunately but little attention is paid to the\r\npossibility of infection by disease germs. The methods of control which\r\nare applicable to general milk supplies are based on the following\r\nfoundations: (1) the exclusion of all bacterial life, as far as\r\npracticable, at the time the milk is drawn, and the subsequent storage\r\nof the same at temperatures unfavorable for the growth of the organisms\r\nthat do gain access; (2) the removal of the bacteria, wholly or in part,\r\nafter they have once gained access.\r\n\r\nUntil within comparatively recent years, practically no attention was\r\ngiven to the character of milk supplies, except possibly as to the\r\npercentage of butter fat, and sometimes the milk solids which it\r\ncontained. So long as the product could be placed in the hands of the\r\nconsumer in such shape as not to be rejected by him as unfit for food,\r\nno further attention was likely to be given to its character. At\r\npresent, however, much more emphasis is being given to the quality of\r\nmilk, especially as to its germ content; and the milk dealer is\r\nbeginning to recognize the necessity of a greater degree of control.\r\nThis control must not merely concern the handling of the product after\r\nit reaches him, but should go back to the milk producer on the farm.\r\nHere especially, it is necessary to inculcate those methods of\r\ncleanliness which will prevent in large measure the wholesale infection\r\nthat ordinarily occurs.\r\n\r\nThe two watch words which are of the utmost importance to the milk\r\ndealer are _cleanliness_ and _cold_. If the milk is properly drawn from\r\nthe animal in a clean manner and is immediately and thoroughly chilled,\r\nthe dealer has little to fear as to his product. Whenever serious\r\ndifficulties do arise, attributable to bacterial changes, it is because\r\nnegligence has been permitted in one or both directions. The influence\r\nof cleanliness in diminishing the bacterial life in milk and that of low\r\ntemperatures in repressing the growth of those forms which inevitably\r\ngain access has been fully dealt with in preceding chapters. It is of\r\ncourse not practicable to take all of these precautions to which\r\nreference has been made in the securing of large supplies of market milk\r\nfor city use, but great improvement over existing conditions could be\r\nsecured if the public would demand a better supervision of this\r\nimportant food article. Boards of health in our larger cities are\r\nawakening to the importance of this question and are becoming\r\nincreasingly active in the matter of better regulations and the\r\nenforcement of the same.\r\n\r\nNew York City Board of Health has taken an advanced position in\r\nrequiring that all milk sold in the city shall be chilled down to 45 deg.\r\nF. immediately after milking and shall be transported to the city in\r\nrefrigerator cars.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the application of the acid test\r\n(page 52) in the inspection of city milk supplies, and it is the opinion\r\nof the writer that the curd test (see page 76) could also be used with\r\nadvantage in determining the sanitary character of milk. This test\r\nreveals the presence of bacteria usually associated with dirt and\r\npermits of the recognition of milks that have been carelessly handled.\r\nFrom personal knowledge of examinations made of the milk supplies in a\r\nnumber of Wisconsin cities it appears that this test could be utilized\r\nwith evident advantage.\r\n\r\n~\"Sanitary\" or \"certified\" milk supplies.~ In a number of the larger\r\ncities, the attempt has been made to improve the quality of the milk\r\nsupplies by the installation of dairies in which is produced an\r\nespecially high grade of milk. Frequently the inspection of the dairy as\r\nwell as the examination of the milk at stated intervals is under the\r\ncontrol of milk commissions or medical societies and as it is customary\r\nto distribute the certificate of the examining board with the product,\r\nsuch milks are frequently known as \"certified.\" In such dairies the\r\ntuberculin test is used at regular intervals, and the herd inspected\r\nfrequently by competent veterinarians. The methods of control\r\ninaugurated as to clean milking and subsequent handling are such as to\r\ninsure the diminution of the bacteria to the lowest possible point. The\r\nbacterial limit set by the Pediatric Society of Philadelphia is 10,000\r\norganisms per cc. Often it is possible to improve very materially on\r\nthis standard and not infrequently is the supply produced where it\r\ncontains only a few thousand organisms per cc. Where such a degree of\r\ncare is exercised, naturally a considerably higher price must be paid\r\nfor the product,[126] and it should be remembered that the development\r\nof such a system is only possible in relatively large centers where the\r\ndealer can cater to a selected high-class trade. Moreover, it should\r\nalso be borne in mind that such a method of control is only feasible in\r\ndairies that are under individual control. The impossibility of\r\nexercising adequate control with reference to the milking process and\r\nthe care which should be given the milk immediately thereafter, when the\r\nsame is produced on different farms under various auspices is evident.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF MILK SUPPLIES.\r\n\r\nWhile much can be done to improve the quality of milk supplies by\r\nexcluding a large proportion of the bacteria which normally gain access\r\nto the milk, and preventing the rapid growth of those that do find their\r\nway therein, yet for general municipal purposes, any practical method of\r\npreservation[127] that is applicable on a commercial scale must rest\r\nlargely upon the destruction of bacteria that are present in the milk.\r\n\r\nThe two possible methods by which bacteria can be destroyed after they\r\nhave once gained access is (1) by the use of chemical preservatives; (2)\r\nby the aid of physical methods.\r\n\r\n~Chemical preservatives.~ Numerous attempts have been made to find some\r\nchemical substance that could be added to milk which would preserve it\r\nwithout interfering with its nutritive properties, but as a general rule\r\na substance that is toxic enough to destroy or inhibit the growth of\r\nbacterial life exerts a prejudicial effect on the tissues of the body.\r\nThe use of chemicals, such as carbolic acid, mercury salts and mineral\r\nacids, that are able to entirely destroy all life, is of course\r\nexcluded, except when milk is preserved for analytical purposes; but a\r\nnumber of milder substances are more or less extensively employed,\r\nalthough the statutes of practically all states forbid their use.\r\n\r\nThe substances so used may be grouped in two classes:\r\n\r\n1. Those that unite chemically with certain by-products of bacterial\r\ngrowth to form inert substances. Thus bicarbonate of soda neutralizes\r\nthe acid in souring milk, although it does not destroy the lactic acid\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\n2. Those that act directly upon the bacteria in milk, restraining or\r\ninhibiting their development. The substances most frequently utilized\r\nare salicylic acid, formaldehyde and boracic acid. These are nearly\r\nalways sold to the milk handler, under some proprietary name, at prices\r\ngreatly in excess of what the crude chemicals could be bought for in the\r\nopen market. Formaldehyde has been widely advertised of late, but its\r\nuse is fraught with the greatest danger, for it practically renders\r\ninsoluble all albuminous matter and its toxic effect is greatly\r\nincreased in larger doses.\r\n\r\nThese substances are generally used by milk handlers who know nothing of\r\ntheir poisonous action, and although it may be possible for adults to\r\nwithstand their use in dilute form, without serious results, yet their\r\naddition to general milk supplies that may be used by children is\r\nlittle short of criminal. The sale of these preparations for use in milk\r\nfinds its only outlet with those dairymen who are anxious to escape the\r\nexactions that must be met by all who attempt to handle milk in the best\r\npossible manner. Farrington has suggested a simple means for the\r\ndetection of preservalin (boracic acid).[128] When this substance is\r\nadded to fresh milk, it increases the acidity of milk without affecting\r\nits taste. As normal milk tastes sour when it contains about 0.3 per\r\ncent lactic acid, a milk that tests as much or more than this without\r\ntasting sour has been probably treated with this antiseptic agent.\r\n\r\n~Physical methods of preservation.~ Methods based upon the application of\r\nphysical forces are less likely to injure the nutritive value of milk,\r\nand are consequently more effective, if of any value whatever. A number\r\nof methods have been tried more or less thoroughly in an experimental\r\nway that have not yet been reduced to a practical basis, as electricity,\r\nuse of a vacuum, and increased pressure.[129] Condensation has long been\r\nused with great success, but in this process the nature of the milk is\r\nmaterially changed. The keeping quality in condensed milk often depends\r\nupon the action of another principle, viz., the inhibition of bacterial\r\ngrowth by reason of the concentration of the medium. This condition is\r\nreached either by adding sugar and so increasing the soluble solids, or\r\nby driving off the water by evaporation, preferably in a vacuum pan.\r\nTemperature changes are, however, of the most value in preserving milk,\r\nfor by a variation in temperature all bacterial growth can be brought to\r\na standstill, and under proper conditions thoroughly destroyed.\r\n\r\n~Use of low temperatures.~ The effect of chilling or rapid cooling on the\r\nkeeping quality of milk is well known. When the temperature of milk is\r\nlowered to the neighborhood of 45 deg. F., the development of bacterial\r\nlife is so slow as to materially increase the period that milk remains\r\nsweet. Within recent years, attempts have been made to preserve milk so\r\nthat it could be shipped long distances by freezing the product, which\r\nin the form of milk-ice could be held for an indefinite period without\r\nchange.[130] A modification of this process known as Casse's system has\r\nbeen in use more or less extensively in Copenhagen and in several places\r\nin Germany. This consists of adding a small block of milk-ice (frozen\r\nmilk) to large cans of milk (one part to about fifty of milk) which may\r\nor may not be pasteurized.[131] This reduces the temperature so that the\r\nmilk remains sweet considerably longer. Such a process might permit of\r\nthe shipment of milk for long distances with safety but as a matter of\r\nfact, the system has not met with especial favor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. Microscopic appearance of normal milk showing\r\nthe fat-globules aggregated in clusters.]\r\n\r\n~Use of high temperatures.~ Heat has long been used as a preserving agent.\r\nMilk has been scalded or cooked to keep it from time immemorial. Heat\r\nmay be used at different temperatures, and when so applied exerts a\r\nvarying effect, depending upon temperature employed. All methods of\r\npreservation by heat rest, however, upon the application of the heat\r\nunder the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1. A temperature above the maximum growing-point (105 deg.-115 deg. F.)\r\nand below the thermal death-point (130 deg.-140 deg. F.) will prevent\r\nfurther growth, and consequently fermentative action.\r\n\r\n2. A temperature above the thermal death-point destroys bacteria, and\r\nthereby stops all changes. This temperature varies, however, with the\r\ncondition of the bacteria, and for spores is much higher than for\r\nvegetative forms.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to employ the first principle in shipping milk\r\nby rail, viz., prolonged heating above growing temperature, but when\r\nmilk is so heated, its physical appearance is changed.[132] The methods\r\nof heating most satisfactorily used are known as sterilization and\r\npasteurization, in which a degree of temperature is used approximating\r\nthe boiling and scalding points respectively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. Microscopic appearance of milk heated above 140\r\ndeg. F., showing the homogeneous distribution of fat-globules. The\r\nphysical change noted in comparison with Fig. 22 causes the diminished\r\nconsistency of pasteurized cream.]\r\n\r\n~Effect of heat on milk.~ When milk is subjected to the action of heat, a\r\nnumber of changes in its physical and chemical properties are to be\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\n_1. Diminished \"body.\"_ When milk, but more especially cream, is heated\r\nto 140 deg. F. or above, it becomes thinner in consistency or \"body,\" a\r\ncondition which is due to a change in the grouping of the fat globules.\r\nIn normal milk, the butter fat for the most part is massed in\r\nmicroscopic clots as (Fig. 22). When exposed to 140 deg. F. or above for\r\nten minutes these fat-globule clots break down, and the globules become\r\nhomogeneously distributed (Fig. 23). A _momentary_ exposure to heat as\r\nhigh as 158 deg.-160 deg. may be made without serious effect on the cream\r\nlime; but above this the cream rises so poorly and slowly that it gives\r\nthe impression of thinner milk.\r\n\r\n_2. Cooked Taste._ If milk is heated for some minutes to 160 deg. F., it\r\nacquires a cooked taste that becomes more pronounced as the temperature\r\nis further raised. Milk so heated develops on its surface a pellicle or\r\n\"skin.\" The cause of this change in taste is not well known. Usually it\r\nhas been explained as being produced by changes in the nitrogenous\r\nelements in the milk, particularly in the albumen. Thoerner[133] has\r\npointed out the coincidence that exists between the appearance of a\r\ncooked taste and the loss of certain gases that are expelled by heating.\r\nHe finds that the milk heated in closed vessels from which the gas\r\ncannot escape has a much less pronounced cooked flavor than if heated in\r\nan open vessel. The so-called \"skin\" on the surface of heated milk is\r\nnot formed when the milk is heated in a tightly-closed receptacle. By\r\nsome[134] it is asserted that this layer is composed of albumen, but\r\nthere is evidence to show that it is modified casein due to the rapid\r\nevaporation of the milk serum at the surface of the milk.\r\n\r\n_3. Digestibility._ Considerable difference of opinion has existed in\r\nthe minds of medical men as to the relative digestibility of raw and\r\nheated milks. A considerable amount of experimental work has been done\r\nby making artificial digestion experiments with enzyms, also digestion\r\nexperiments with animals, and in a few cases with children. The results\r\nobtained by different investigators are quite contradictory, although\r\nthe preponderance of evidence seems to be in favor of the view that\r\nheating does impair the digestibility of milk, especially if the\r\ntemperature attains the sterilizing point.[135] It has been observed\r\nthat there is a noteworthy increase in amount of rickets,[136] scurvy\r\nand marasmus in children where highly-heated milks are employed. These\r\nobjections do not obtain with reference to milk heated to moderate\r\ntemperatures, as in pasteurization, although even this lower temperature\r\nlessens slightly its digestibility. The successful use of pasteurized\r\nmilks in children's hospitals is evidence of its usefulness.\r\n\r\n_4. Fermentative changes._ The normal souring change in milk is due to\r\nthe predominance of the lactic acid bacteria, but as these organisms as\r\na class do not possess spores, they are readily killed when heated above\r\nthe thermal death-point of the developing cell. The destruction of the\r\nlactic forms leaves the spore-bearing types possessors of the field, and\r\nconsequently the fermentative changes in heated milk are not those that\r\nusually occur, but are characterized by the curdling of the milk from\r\nthe action of rennet enzyms.\r\n\r\n_5. Action of rennet._ Heating milk causes the soluble lime salts to be\r\nprecipitated, and as the curdling of milk by rennet (in cheese-making)\r\nis dependent upon the presence of these salts, their absence in heated\r\nmilks greatly retards the action of rennet. This renders it difficult to\r\nutilize heated milks in cheese-making unless the soluble lime salts are\r\nrestored, which can be done by adding solutions of calcium chlorid.\r\n\r\n~Sterilization.~ As ordinarily used in dairying, sterilization means the\r\napplication of heat at temperatures approximating, if not exceeding,\r\n212 deg. F. It does not necessarily imply that milk so treated is sterile,\r\ni. e., germ-free; for, on account of the resistance of spores, it is\r\npractically impossible to destroy entirely _all_ these hardy forms. If\r\nmilk is heated at temperatures above the boiling point, as is done where\r\nsteam pressure is utilized, it can be rendered practically germ-free.\r\nSuch methods are employed where it is designed to keep milk sweet for a\r\nlong period of time. The treatment of milk by sterilization has not met\r\nwith any general favor in this country, although it has been more widely\r\nintroduced abroad. In most cases the process is carried out after the\r\nmilk is bottled; and considerable ingenuity has been exercised in the\r\nconstruction of devices which will permit of the closure of the bottles\r\nafter the sterilizing process has been completed. Milks heated to so\r\nhigh a temperature have a more or less pronounced boiled or cooked\r\ntaste, a condition that does not meet with general favor in this\r\ncountry. The apparatus suitable for this purpose must, of necessity, be\r\nso constructed as to withstand steam pressure, and consequently is\r\nconsiderably more expensive than that required for the simpler\r\npasteurizing process.\r\n\r\n~Pasteurization.~ In this method the degree of heat used ranges from 140\r\ndeg. to 185 deg. F. and the application is made for only a limited length\r\nof time. The process was first extensively used by Pasteur (from whom it\r\nderives its name) in combating various maladies of beer and wine. Its\r\nimportance as a means of increasing the keeping quality of milk was not\r\ngenerally recognized until a few years ago; but the method is now\r\ngrowing rapidly in favor as a means of preserving milk for commercial\r\npurposes. The method does not destroy all germ-life in milk; it affects\r\nonly those organisms that are in a growing, vegetative condition; but if\r\nthe milk is quickly cooled, it enhances the keeping quality very\r\nmaterially. It is unfortunate that this same term is used in connection\r\nwith the heating of cream as a preparatory step to the use of pure\r\ncultures in cream-ripening in butter-making. The objects to be\r\naccomplished vary materially and the details of the two processes are\r\nalso quite different.\r\n\r\nWhile pasteurizing can be performed on a small scale by the individual,\r\nthe process can also be adapted to the commercial treatment of large\r\nquantities of milk. The apparatus necessary for this purpose is not\r\nnearly so expensive as that used in sterilizing, a factor of importance\r\nwhen other advantages are considered. In this country pasteurization has\r\nmade considerable headway, not only in supplying a milk that is designed\r\nto serve as children's food, but even for general purposes.\r\n\r\n~Requirements essential in pasteurization.~ While considerable latitude\r\nwith reference to pasteurizing limits is permitted, yet there are\r\ncertain conditions which should be observed, and these, in a sense, fix\r\nthe limits that should be employed. These may be designated as (1) the\r\n_physical_, and (2) the _biological_ requirements.\r\n\r\n~Physical requirements.~ _1. Avoidance of scalded or cooked taste._ The\r\nEnglish and American people are so averse to a scalded or cooked flavor\r\nin milk that it is practically impossible for a highly heated product to\r\nbe sold in competition with ordinary raw milk. In pasteurization then,\r\ncare must be taken not to exceed the temperature at which a permanently\r\ncooked flavor is developed. As previously observed, this point varies\r\nwith the period of exposure. A momentary exposure to a temperature of\r\nabout 170 deg. F. may be made without any material alteration, but if\r\nthe heat is maintained for a few minutes (ten minutes or over), a\r\ntemperature of 158 deg. to 160 deg. F. is about the maximum that can be\r\nemployed with safety.\r\n\r\n_2. Normal creaming of the milk._ It is especially desirable that a\r\nsharp and definite cream line be evident on the milk soon after\r\npasteurization. If this fails to appear, the natural inference of the\r\nconsumer is that the milk is skimmed. If the milk be heated to a\r\ntemperature sufficiently high to cause the fat-globule clusters to\r\ndisintegrate (see Figs. 22 and 23), the globules do not rise to the\r\nsurface as readily as before and the cream line remains indistinct.\r\nWhere the exposure is made for a considerable period of time (10 minutes\r\nor more), the maximum temperature which can be used without producing\r\nthis change is about 140 deg. F.; if the exposure is made for a very\r\nbrief time, a minute or less, the milk may be heated to 158 deg.-160 F.\r\ndeg. without injuring the creaming property.\r\n\r\n_3. No diminution in cream \"body.\"_ Coincident with this change which\r\ntakes place in the creaming of the milk is the change in body or\r\nconsistency which is noted where cream is pasteurized at too high a\r\ntemperature. For the same reason as given under (2) cream heated above\r\nthese temperatures is reduced in apparent thickness and appears to\r\ncontain less butter-fat. Of course the pasteurizing process does not\r\nchange the fat content, but its \"body\" is apparently so affected. Thus a\r\n25 per cent. cream may seem to be no thicker or heavier than an 18 per\r\ncent. raw cream. This real reduction in consistency naturally affects\r\nthe readiness with which the cream can be whipped.\r\n\r\n~Biological requirements.~ _1. Enhanced keeping quality._ In commercial\r\npractice the essential biological requirement is expressed in the\r\nenhanced keeping quality of the pasteurized milk. This expresses in a\r\npractical way the reduction in germ life accomplished by the\r\npasteurizing process. The improvement in keeping quality depends upon\r\nthe temperature and time of exposure, but fully as much also on the way\r\nin which the pasteurized product is handled after heating. The lowest\r\ntemperature which can be used with success to kill the active,\r\nvegetative bacteria is about 140 deg. F., at which point it requires\r\nabout ten minutes exposure. If this period is curtailed the temperature\r\nmust be raised accordingly. An exposure to a temperature of 175 deg. F.\r\nfor a minute has approximately the same effect as the lower degree of\r\nheat for the longer time.\r\n\r\nThe following bacteriological studies as to the effect which a variation\r\nin temperature exerts on bacterial life in milk are of importance as\r\nindicating the foundation for the selection of the proper limits. In the\r\nfollowing table the exposures were made for a uniform period (20\r\nminutes):\r\n\r\n_The bacterial content of milk heated at different temperatures._\r\n\r\n                          Number of bacteria per cc. in milk.\r\n                            45 deg. C.     50 deg. C.   55 deg. C.   60 deg. C.   65 deg. C.  70 deg. C.\r\n               Unheated    113 deg. F.    122 deg. F.  131 deg. F.  140 deg. F.  149 deg. F. 158 deg. F.\r\nSeries I.     2,895,000    ----         1,260,000      798,000       32,000        5,770       3,900\r\nSeries II.      750,000    665,000        262,400      201,000          950          700         705\r\nSeries III.   1,350,000  1,100,000        260,000      215,000          575          610         650\r\nSeries IV.    1,750,000    ----            87,360       ----          4,000        3,500       3,600\r\n\r\nIt appears from these results that the most marked decrease in\r\ntemperature occurs at 140 deg. F. (60 deg. C.). It should also be observed\r\nthat an increase in heat above this temperature did not materially\r\ndiminish the number of organisms present, indicating that those forms\r\nremaining were in a spore or resistant condition. It was noted, however,\r\nthat the developing colonies grew more slowly in the plates made from the\r\nhighly heated milk, showing that their vitality was injured to a greater\r\nextent even though not killed.\r\n\r\n_2. Destruction of disease bacteria._ While milk should be pasteurized\r\nso as to destroy all active, multiplying bacteria, it is particularly\r\nimportant to destroy any organisms of a disease nature that might find\r\ntheir way into the same. Fortunately most of the bacteria capable of\r\nthriving in milk before or after it is drawn from the animal are not\r\nable to form spores and hence succumb to proper pasteurization. Such is\r\nthe case with the diphtheria, cholera and typhoid organisms.\r\n\r\nThe organism that is invested with most interest in this connection is\r\nthe tubercle bacillus. On account of its more or less frequent\r\noccurrence in milk and its reputed high powers of resistance, it may\r\nwell be taken as a standard in pasteurizing.\r\n\r\n~Thermal death limits of tubercle bacillus.~ Concerning the exact\r\ntemperature at which this germ is destroyed there is considerable\r\ndifference of opinion. Part of this arises from the inherent difficulty\r\nin determining exactly when the organism is killed (due to its failure\r\nto grow readily on artificial media), and part from the lack of uniform\r\nconditions of exposure. The standards that previously have been most\r\ngenerally accepted are those of De Man,[137] who found that thirty\r\nminutes exposure at 149 deg. F., fifteen minutes at 155 deg. F., or ten\r\nminutes at 167 deg. F., sufficed to destroy this germ.\r\n\r\nMore recently it has been demonstrated,[138] and these results\r\nconfirmed,[139] that if tuberculous milk is heated in closed receptacles\r\nwhere the surface pellicle does not form, the vitality of this disease\r\ngerm is destroyed at 140 deg. F. in 10-15 minutes, while an exposure at\r\n160 deg. F. requires only about one minute.[140] If the conditions of\r\nheating are such that the surface of the milk is exposed to the air, the\r\nresistance of bacteria is greatly increased. When heated in open vessels\r\nSmith found that the tubercle organism was not killed in some cases where\r\nthe exposure was made for at least an hour. Russell and Hastings[141]\r\nhave shown an instance where the thermal death-point of a micrococcus\r\nisolated from pasteurized milk was increased 12.5 deg. F., by heating it\r\nunder conditions that permitted of the formation of the scalded layer.\r\nIt is therefore apparent that apparatus used for pasteurization should\r\nbe constructed so as to avoid this defect.\r\n\r\n~Methods of treatment.~ Two different systems of pasteurization have grown\r\nup in the treatment of milk. One of these has been developed from the\r\nhygienic or sanitary aspect of the problem and is used more particularly\r\nin the treatment of cream and relatively small milk supplies. The other\r\nsystem has been developed primarily from the commercial point of view\r\nwhere a large amount of milk must be treated in the minimum time. In the\r\nfirst method the milk is heated for a longer period of time, about\r\nfifteen minutes at a relatively low temperature from 140 deg.-155 deg.\r\nF.; in the other, the milk is exposed to the source of heat only while\r\nit is passing rapidly through the apparatus. Naturally, the exposure\r\nunder such conditions must be made at a considerably higher temperature,\r\nusually in the neighborhood of 160 deg. F.\r\n\r\nThe types of apparatus used in these respective processes naturally\r\nvaries. Where the heating is prolonged, the apparatus employed is built\r\non the principle of a _tank_ or _reservoir_ in which a given volume of\r\nmilk may be held at any given temperature for any given period of time.\r\n\r\nWhen the heat is applied for a much shorter period of time, the milk is\r\npassed in a continuous stream through the machine. Naturally the\r\ncapacity of a continuous-flow apparatus is much greater than a machine\r\nthat operates on the intermittent principle; hence, for large supplies,\r\nas in city distribution, this system has a great advantage. The question\r\nas to relative efficiency is however one which should be given most\r\ncareful consideration.\r\n\r\n~Pasteurizing apparatus.~ The problems to be solved in the pasteurization\r\nof milk and cream designed for direct consumption are so materially\r\ndifferent from where the process is used in butter-making that the type\r\nof machinery for each purpose is quite different. The equipment\r\nnecessary for the first purpose may be divided into two general classes:\r\n\r\n1. Apparatus of limited capacity designed for family use.\r\n\r\n2. Apparatus of sufficient capacity to pasteurize on a commercial scale.\r\n\r\n~Domestic pasteurizers.~ In pasteurizing milk for individual use, it is\r\nnot desirable to treat at one time more than will be consumed in one\r\nday; hence an apparatus holding a few bottles will suffice. In this case\r\nthe treatment can best be performed in the bottle itself, thereby\r\nlessening the danger of infection. Several different types of\r\npasteurizers are on the market; but special apparatus is by no means\r\nnecessary for the purpose. The process can be efficiently performed by\r\nany one with the addition of an ordinary dairy thermometer to the common\r\nutensils found in the kitchen. Fig. 24 indicates a simple contrivance\r\nthat can be readily arranged for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe following suggestions indicate the different steps of the process:\r\n\r\n1. Use only fresh milk.\r\n\r\n2. Place milk in clean bottles or fruit cans, filling to a uniform\r\nlevel, closing bottles tightly with a cork or cover. If pint and quart\r\ncans are used at the same time, an inverted bowl will equalize the\r\nlevel. Set these in a flat-bottomed tin pail and fill with warm water to\r\nsame level as milk. An inverted pie tin punched with holes will serve as\r\na stand on which to place the bottles during the heating process.\r\n\r\n3. Heat water in pail until the temperature of same reaches 155 deg. to\r\n160 deg. F.; then remove from source of direct heat, cover with a cloth\r\nor tin cover, and allow the whole to stand for half an hour. In the\r\npreparation of milk for children, it is not advisable to use the\r\nlow-temperature treatment (140 deg. F.) that is recommended for\r\ncommercial city delivery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. A home-made pasteurizer.]\r\n\r\n4. Remove bottles of milk and cool them as rapidly as possible without\r\ndanger to bottles and store in a refrigerator.\r\n\r\n~Commercial pasteurizers.~ The two methods of pasteurization practiced\r\ncommercially for the preservation of milk and cream have been developed\r\nbecause of the two types of machinery now in use. Apparatus constructed\r\non the reservoir or tank principle permits of the retention of the milk\r\nfor any desired period of time. Therefore, a lower temperature can be\r\nemployed in the treatment. In those machines where the milk flows\r\nthrough the heater in a more or less continuous stream, the period of\r\nexposure is necessarily curtailed, thereby necessitating a higher\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n~Reservoir pasteurizers.~ The simplest type of apparatus suitable for\r\npasteurizing on this principle is where the milk is placed in shotgun\r\ncans and immersed in water heated by steam. Ordinary tanks surrounded\r\nwith water spaces can also be used successfully. The Boyd cream ripening\r\nvat has also been tried. In this the milk is heated by a swinging coil\r\nimmersed in the vat through which hot water circulates.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the writer[142] constructed a tank pasteurizer which consisted\r\nof a long, narrow vat surrounded by a steam-heated water chamber. Both\r\nthe milk and the water chambers were provided with mechanical agitators\r\nhaving a to-and-fro movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25. Pott's pasteurizer.]\r\n\r\nAnother machine which has been quite generally introduced is the Potts'\r\nrotating pasteurizer. This apparatus has a central milk chamber that is\r\nsurrounded with an outer shell containing hot water. The whole machine\r\nrevolves on a horizontal axis, and the cream or milk is thus thoroughly\r\nagitated during the heating process.\r\n\r\n~Continuous-flow pasteurizers.~ The demand for greater capacity than can\r\nbe secured in the reservoir machines has led to the perfection of\r\nseveral kinds of apparatus where the milk is heated momentarily as it\r\nflows through the apparatus. Most of these were primarily introduced for\r\nthe treatment of cream for butter-making purposes, but they are\r\nfrequently employed for the treatment of milk on a large scale in city\r\nmilk trade. Many of them are of European origin although of late years\r\nseveral have been devised in this country.\r\n\r\nThe general principle of construction is much the same in most of them.\r\nThe milk is spread out in a thin sheet, and is treated by passing it\r\nover a surface, heated either with steam directly or preferably with hot\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWhere steam is used directly, it is impossible to prevent the \"scalding\r\non\" of the milk proteids to the heated surface.\r\n\r\nIn some of these machines (Thiel, Kuehne, Lawrence, De Laval, and\r\nHochmuth), a ribbed surface is employed over which the milk flows, while\r\nthe opposite surface is heated with hot water or steam. Monrad, Lefeldt\r\nand Lentsch employ a centrifugal apparatus in which a thin layer of milk\r\nis heated in a revolving drum.\r\n\r\nIn some types of apparatus, as in the Miller machine, an American\r\npasteurizer, the milk is forced in a thin sheet between two heated\r\nsurfaces, thereby facilitating the heating process. In the Farrington\r\nmachine heated discs rotate in a reservoir through which the milk flows\r\nin a continuous stream.\r\n\r\nOne of the most economical types of apparatus is the regenerator type (a\r\nGerman machine), in which the milk passes over the heating surface in a\r\nthin stream and then is carried back over the incoming cold milk so\r\nthat the heated liquid is partially cooled by the inflowing fresh milk.\r\nIn machines of this class it requires very much less steam to heat up\r\nthe milk than in those in which the cold milk is heated wholly by the\r\nhot water.\r\n\r\nA number of machines have been constructed on the principle of a\r\nreservoir which is fed by a constantly flowing stream. In some kinds of\r\napparatus of this type no attempt is made to prevent the mixing of the\r\nrecently introduced milk with that which has been partially heated. The\r\npattern for this reservoir type is Fjord's heater, in which the milk is\r\nstirred by a stirrer. This apparatus was originally designed as a heater\r\nfor milk before separation, but it has since been materially modified so\r\nthat it is better adapted to the purposes of pasteurization. Reid was\r\nthe first to introduce this type of machine into America.\r\n\r\n~Objections to continuous flow pasteurizers.~ In all continuous flow\r\npasteurizers certain defects are more or less evident. While they\r\nfulfill the important requirement of large capacity, an absolute\r\nessential where large volumes of milk are being handled, it does not of\r\nnecessity follow that they conform to all the hygienic and physical\r\nrequirements that should be kept in mind. The greatest difficulty is the\r\nshortened period of exposure. The period which the milk is actually\r\nheated is often not more than a minute or so. Another serious defect is\r\nthe inability to heat _all_ of the milk for a uniform period of time. At\r\nbest, the milk is exposed for an extremely short time, but even then\r\nportions pass through the machine much more quickly than do the\r\nremainder. Those portions in contact with the walls of the apparatus are\r\nretarded by friction and are materially delayed in their passage, while\r\nthe particles in the center of the stream, however thin, flow through\r\nin the least possible time.\r\n\r\nThe following simple method enables the factory operator to test the\r\nperiod of exposure in the machine: Start the machine full of water, and\r\nafter the same has become heated to the proper temperature, change the\r\ninflow to full-cream milk, continuing at the same rate. Note the exact\r\ntime of change and also when first evidence of milkiness begins to\r\nappear at outflow. If samples are taken from first appearance of milky\r\ncondition and thereafter at different intervals for several minutes, it\r\nis possible, by determining the amount of butter-fat in the same, to\r\ncalculate with exactness how long it takes for the milk to entirely\r\nreplace the water.\r\n\r\nTests made by the writer[143] on the Miller pasteurizer showed, when fed\r\nat the rate of 1,700 pounds per hour, the minimum period of exposure to\r\nbe 15 seconds, and the maximum about 60-70 seconds, while about\r\ntwo-thirds of the milk passed the machine in 40-50 seconds. This\r\nmanifest variation in the rate of flow of the milk through the machine\r\nis undoubtedly the reason why the results of this type of treatment are\r\nsubject to so much variation. Naturally, even a fatal temperature to\r\nbacterial life can be reduced to a point where actual destruction of\r\neven vegetating cells does not occur.\r\n\r\n~Bacterial efficiency of reservoir pasteurizers.~ The bacterial content of\r\npasteurized milk and cream will depend somewhat on the number of\r\norganisms originally present in the same. Naturally, if mixed milk\r\nbrought to a creamery is pasteurized, the number of organisms remaining\r\nafter treatment would be greater than if the raw material was fresh and\r\nproduced on a single farm.\r\n\r\nAn examination of milk and cream pasteurized on a commercial scale in\r\nthe Russell vat at the Wisconsin Dairy school showed that over 99.8 per\r\ncent of the bacterial life in raw milk or cream was destroyed by the\r\nheat employed, i. e., 155 deg. F. for twenty minutes duration.[144] In\r\nnearly one-half of the samples of milk, the germ content in the\r\npasteurized sample fell below 1,000 bacteria per cc., and the average of\r\ntwenty-five samples contained 6,140 bacteria per cc. In cream the germ\r\ncontent was higher, averaging about 25,000 bacteria per cc. This milk\r\nwas taken from the general creamery supply, which was high in organisms,\r\ncontaining on an average 3,675,000 bacteria per cc. De Schweinitz[145]\r\nhas reported the germ content of a supply furnished in Washington which\r\nwas treated at 158 deg. to 160 deg. F. for fifteen minutes. This supply\r\ncame from a single source. Figures reported were from 48-hour-old agar\r\nplates. Undoubtedly these would have been higher if a longer period of\r\nincubation had been maintained. The average of 82 samples, taken for the\r\nperiod of one year, showed 325 bacteria per cc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26. Effect of pasteurizing on germ content of milk.\r\nBlack square represents bacteria of raw milk; small white square, those\r\nremaining after pasteurization.]\r\n\r\n~Bacterial efficiency of continuous-flow pasteurizers.~ A quantitative\r\ndetermination of the bacteria found in milk and cream when treated in\r\nmachinery of this class almost always shows a degree of variation in\r\nresults that is not to be noted in the discontinuous apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. Reid's Continuous Pasteurizer.]\r\n\r\nHarding and Rogers[146] have tested the efficiency of one of the Danish\r\ntype of continuous pasteurizers. These experiments were made at 158 deg.,\r\n176 deg. and 185 deg. F. They found the efficiency of the machine not\r\nwholly satisfactory at the lower temperatures. At 158 deg. F. the average\r\nof fourteen tests gave 15,300 bacteria per cc., with a maximum to minimum\r\nrange from 62,790 to 120. Twenty-five examinations at 176 deg. F. showed\r\nan average of only 117, with a range from 300 to 20. The results at 185\r\ndeg. F. showed practically the same results as noted at 176 deg. F.\r\nConsiderable trouble was experienced with the \"scalding on\" of the milk\r\nto the walls of the machine when milk of high acidity was used.\r\n\r\nJensen[147] details the results of 139 tests in 1899, made by the\r\nCopenhagen Health Commission. In 66 samples from one hundred thousand to\r\none million organisms per cc. were found, and in 22 cases from one to\r\nfive millions. Nineteen tests showed less than 10,000 per cc.\r\n\r\nIn a series of tests conducted by the writer[148] on a Miller\r\npasteurizer in commercial operation, an average of 21 tests showed\r\n12,350 bacteria remaining in the milk when the milk was pasteurized from\r\n156 deg.-164 deg. F. The raw milk in these tests ran from 115,000 to\r\nabout one million organisms per cc.\r\n\r\nA recently devised machine of this type (Pasteur) has been tested by\r\nLehmann, who found that it was necessary to heat the milk as high as\r\n176 deg. to 185 deg. F., in order to secure satisfactory results on the\r\nbacterial content of the cream.\r\n\r\nThe writer tested Reid's pasteurizer at 155 deg. to 165 deg. F. with the\r\nfollowing results: in some cases as many as 40 per cent. of the bacteria\r\nsurvived, which number in some cases exceeded 2,000,000 bacteria per\r\ncc.\r\n\r\n~Pasteurizing details.~ While the pasteurizing process is exceedingly\r\nsimple, yet, in order to secure the best results, certain conditions\r\nmust be rigidly observed in the treatment before and after the heating\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nIt is important to select the best possible milk for pasteurizing, for\r\nif the milk has not been milked under clean conditions, it is likely to\r\nbe rich in the spore-bearing bacteria. Old milk, or milk that has not\r\nbeen kept at a low temperature, is much richer in germ-life than\r\nperfectly fresh or thoroughly chilled milk.\r\n\r\nThe true standard for selecting milk for pasteurization should be to\r\ndetermine the actual number of bacterial _spores_ that are able to\r\nresist the heating process, but this method is impracticable under\r\ncommercial conditions.\r\n\r\nThe following method, while only approximate in its results, will be\r\nfound helpful: Assuming that the age or treatment of the milk bears a\r\ncertain relation to the presence of spores, and that the acid increases\r\nin a general way with an increase in age or temperature, the amount of\r\nacid present may be taken as an approximate index of the suitability of\r\nthe milk for pasteurizing purposes. Biological tests were carried out in\r\nthe author's laboratory[149] on milks having a high and low acid\r\ncontent, and it was shown that the milk with the least acid was, as a\r\nrule, the freest from spore-bearing bacteria.\r\n\r\nThis acid determination can be made at the weigh-can by employing the\r\nFarrington alkaline tablet which is used in cream-ripening. Where milk\r\nis pasteurized under general creamery conditions, none should be used\r\ncontaining more than 0.2 per cent acidity. If only perfectly fresh milk\r\nis used, the amount of acid will generally be about 0.15 per cent with\r\nphenolphthalein as indicator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. Diagram showing temperature changes in\r\npasteurizing, and the relation of same to bacterial growth.\r\n\r\nShaded zone represents limits of bacterial growth, 50 deg.-109 deg. F.\r\n(10 deg.-43 deg. C.), the intensity of shading indicating rapidity of\r\ndevelopment. The solid black line shows temperature of milk during the\r\nprocess. The necessity for rapid cooling is evident as the milk falls\r\nin temperature to that of growing zone.]\r\n\r\nEmphasis has already been laid on the selection of a proper limit of\r\npasteurizing (p. 114). It should be kept constantly in mind that the\r\nthermal death-point of any organism depends not alone on the temperature\r\nused, but on the period of exposure. With the lower limits given, 140\r\ndeg. F., it is necessary to expose the milk for not less than fifteen\r\nminutes. If a higher heat is employed (and the cooked flavor\r\ndisregarded) the period of exposure may be curtailed.\r\n\r\n~Chilling the milk.~ It is very essential in pasteurizing that the heated\r\nmilk be immediately chilled in order to prevent the germination of the\r\nresistant spores, for if germination once occurs, growth can go on at\r\nrelatively low temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe following experiments by Marshall[150] are of interest as showing\r\nthe influence of refrigeration on germination of spores:\r\n\r\nCultures of organisms that had been isolated from pasteurized milk were\r\ninoculated into bouillon. One set was left to grow at room temperature,\r\nanother was pasteurized and allowed to stand at same temperature, while\r\nanother heated set was kept in a refrigerator. The unheated cultures at\r\nroom temperature showed evidence of growth in thirty trials in an\r\naverage of 26 hours; 29 heated cultures at room temperature all\r\ndeveloped in an average of 50 hours, while the heated cultures kept in\r\nrefrigerator showed no growth in 45 days with but four exceptions.\r\n\r\nPractically all of the rapid-process machines are provided with\r\nespecially constructed cooling devices. In some of them, as in the\r\nMiller and Farrington, the cooling is effected by passing the milk\r\nthrough two separate coolers that are constructed in the same general\r\nway as the heater. With the first cooler, cold running water is\r\nemployed, the temperature often being lowered in this way to 58 deg. or\r\n60 deg. F. Further lessening of the temperature is secured by an\r\nadditional ice water or brine cooler which brings the temperature down\r\nto 40 deg.-50 deg. F.\r\n\r\nIn the economical use of ice the ice itself should be applied as closely\r\nas possibly to the milk to be cooled, for the larger part of the\r\nchilling value of ice comes from the melting of the same. To convert a\r\npound of ice at 32 deg. F. into a pound of water at the same temperature,\r\nif we disregard radiation, would require as much heat as would suffice to\r\nraise 142 pounds of water one degree F., or one pound of water 142 deg. F.\r\nThe absorptive capacity of milk for heat (specific heat) is not quite\r\nthe same as it is with water, being .847 for milk in comparison with 1.0\r\nfor water.[151] Hot milk would therefore require somewhat less ice to\r\ncool it than would be required by any equal volume of water at the same\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n~Bottling the product.~ If the milk has been properly pasteurized, it\r\nshould, of course, be dispensed in sterilized bottles. Glass bottles\r\nwith plain pulp caps are best, and these should be thoroughly sterilized\r\nin steam before using. The bottling can best be done in a commercial\r\nbottling machine. Care must be taken to thoroughly clean this apparatus\r\nafter use each day. Rubber valves in these machines suffer deterioration\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29. Relative consistency of pasteurized cream before\r\n(A) and after (B) treatment with viscogen as shown by rate of flow down\r\ninclined glass plate.]\r\n\r\n~Restoration of \"body\" of pasteurized cream.~ The action of heat causes\r\nthe tiny groupings of fat globules in normal milk (Fig. 22) to break up,\r\nand with this change, which occurs in the neighborhood of 140 deg. F.,\r\nwhere the milk is heated for about 15 minutes and at about 160-165 deg.\r\nF. where rapidly heated in a continuous stream, the consistency of the\r\nliquid is diminished, notwithstanding the fact that the fat-content\r\nremains unchanged. Babcock and the writer[152] devised the following\r\n\"cure\" for this apparent defect. If a strong solution of cane sugar is\r\nadded to freshly slacked lime and the mixture allowed to stand, a clear\r\nfluid can be decanted off. The addition of this alkaline liquid, which\r\nis called \"viscogen,\" to pasteurized cream in proportions of about one\r\npart of sugar-lime solution to 100 to 150 of cream, restores the\r\nconsistency of the cream, as it causes the fat globules to cluster\r\ntogether in small groups.\r\n\r\nThe relative viscosity of creams can easily be determined by the\r\nfollowing method (Fig. 29):\r\n\r\nTake a perfectly clean piece of glass (plate or picture glass is\r\npreferable, as it is less liable to be wavy). Drop on one edge two or\r\nthree drops of cream at intervals of an inch or so. Then incline piece\r\nof glass at such an angle as to cause the cream to flow down surface of\r\nglass. The cream, having the heavier body or viscosity, will move more\r\nslowly. If several samples of each cream are taken, then the aggregate\r\nlengths of the different cream paths may be taken, thereby eliminating\r\nslight differences due to condition of glass.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[126] From 10 to 16 cents per quart is usually paid for such milks.\r\n\r\n[127] Much improvement in quality could be made by more careful control\r\nof milk during shipment, especially as to refrigeration; also as to the\r\ncare taken on the farms. The use of the ordinary milking machine (see\r\npage 37), would go far to reduce the germ content of milk.\r\n\r\n[128] Farrington, Journ. Amer. Chem.

The cream may be raised by the gravity process or separated\r\nfrom the milk by centrifugal action. In either case the bacteria that\r\nare normally present in the milk differentiate themselves in varying\r\nnumbers in the cream and the skim-milk. The cream always contains per\r\ncc. a great many more than the skim-milk, the reason for this being that\r\nthe bacteria are caught and held in the masses of fat globules, which,\r\non account of their lighter specific gravity, move toward the surface of\r\nthe milk or toward the interior of the separator bowl. This filtering\r\naction of the fat globules is similar to what happens in muddy water\r\nupon standing. As the suspended particles fall to the bottom they carry\r\nwith them a large number of the organisms that are in the liquid.\r\n\r\n~Various creaming methods.~ The creaming method has an important bearing\r\non the kind as well as the number of the bacteria that are to be found\r\nin the cream. The difference in species is largely determined by the\r\ndifference in ripening temperature, while the varying number is governed\r\nmore by the age of the milk.\r\n\r\n_1. Primitive gravity methods._ In the old shallow-pan process, the\r\ntemperature of the milk is relatively high, as the milk is allowed to\r\ncool naturally. This comparatively high temperature favors especially\r\nthe development of those forms whose optimum growing-point is near the\r\nair temperature. By this method the cream layer is exposed to the air\r\nfor a longer time than with any other, and consequently the\r\ncontamination from this source is greater. Usually cream obtained by the\r\nshallow-pan process will contain a larger number of species and also\r\nhave a higher acid content.\r\n\r\n_2. Modern gravity methods._ In the Cooley process, or any of the modern\r\ngravity methods where cold water or ice is used to lower the\r\ntemperature, the conditions do not favor the growth of a large variety\r\nof species. The number of bacteria in the cream will depend largely upon\r\nthe manner in which the milk is handled previous to setting. If care is\r\nused in milking, and the milk is kept so as to exclude outside\r\ncontamination, the cream will be freer from bacteria than if\r\ncarelessness prevails in handling the milk. Only those forms will\r\ndevelop in abundance that are able to grow at the low temperature at\r\nwhich the milk is set. Cream raised by this method is less frequently\r\ninfected with undesirable forms than that which is creamed at a higher\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n_3. Centrifugal method._ Separator cream should contain less germ-life\r\nthan that which is secured in the old way. It should contain only those\r\nforms that have found their way into the milk during and subsequent to\r\nthe milking, for the cream is ordinarily separated so soon that there is\r\nbut little opportunity of infection, if care is taken in the handling.\r\nAs a consequence, the number of species found therein is smaller.\r\n\r\nWhere milk is separated, it is always prudent to cool the cream so as to\r\ncheck growth, as the milk is generally heated before separating in order\r\nto skim efficiently.\r\n\r\nAlthough cream is numerically much richer in bacteria than milk, yet\r\nthe changes due to bacterial action are slower; hence milk sours more\r\nrapidly than cream. For this same reason, cream will sour sooner when it\r\nremains on the milk than it will if it is separated as soon as possible.\r\nThis fact indicates the necessity of early creaming, so as to increase\r\nthe keeping quality of the product, and is another argument in favor of\r\nthe separator process.\r\n\r\n~Ripening of cream.~ If cream is allowed to remain at ordinary\r\ntemperatures, it undergoes a series of fermentation changes that are\r\nexceedingly complex in character, the result of which is to produce in\r\nbutter made from the same the characteristic flavor and aroma that are\r\nso well known in this article. We are so accustomed to the development\r\nof these flavors in butter that they are not generally recognized as\r\nbeing intimately associated with bacterial activity unless compared with\r\nbutter made from perfectly fresh cream. Sweet-cream butter lacks the\r\naromatic principle that is prominent in the ripened product, and while\r\nthe flavor is delicate, it is relatively unpronounced.\r\n\r\nIn the primitive method of butter-making, where the butter was made on\r\nthe farm, the ripening of cream became a necessity in order that\r\nsufficient material might be accumulated to make a churning. The\r\nripening change occurred spontaneously without the exercise of any\r\nespecial control. With the development of the creamery system came the\r\nnecessity of exercising a control of this process, and therefore the\r\nmodern butter-maker must understand the principles which are involved in\r\nthis series of complex changes that largely give to his product its\r\ncommercial value.\r\n\r\nIn these ripening changes three different factors are to be taken into\r\nconsideration: the development of acid, flavor and aroma. Much confusion\r\nin the past has arisen from a failure to discriminate between these\r\nqualities. While all three are produced simultaneously in ordinary\r\nripening, it does not necessarily follow that they are produced by the\r\nsame cause. If the ripening changes are allowed to go too far,\r\nundesirable rather than beneficial decomposition products are produced.\r\nThese greatly impair the value of butter, so that it becomes necessary\r\nto know just to what extent this process should be carried.\r\n\r\nIn cream ripening there is a very marked bacterial growth, the extent of\r\nwhich is determined mainly by the temperature of the cream. Conn and\r\nEsten[153] find that the number of organisms may vary widely in\r\nunripened cream, but that the germ content of the ripened product is\r\nmore uniform. When cream is ready for the churn, it often contains\r\n500,000,000 organisms per cc., and frequently even a higher number. This\r\nrepresents a germ content that has no parallel in any natural material.\r\n\r\nThe larger proportion of bacteria in cream as it is found in the\r\ncreamery belong to the acid-producing class, but in the process of\r\nripening, these forms seem to thrive still better, so that when it is\r\nready for churning the germ content of the cream is practically made up\r\nof this type.\r\n\r\n~Effect on churning.~ In fresh cream the fat globules which are suspended\r\nin the milk serum are surrounded by a film of albuminous material which\r\nprevents them from coalescing readily. During the ripening changes, this\r\nenveloping substance is modified, probably by partial solution, so that\r\nthe globules cohere when agitated, as in churning. The result is that\r\nripened cream churns more easily, and as it is possible to cause a\r\nlarger number of the smaller fat-globules to cohere to the butter\r\ngranules, the yield is slightly larger--a point of considerable\r\neconomic importance where large quantities of butter are made.\r\n\r\n~Development of acid.~ The result of this enormous bacterial\r\nmultiplication is that acid is produced in cream, lactic being the\r\nprincipal acid so formed.\r\n\r\nOther organic acids are undoubtedly formed as well as certain aromatic\r\nproducts. While the production of acid as a result of fermentative\r\nactivity is usually accompanied with a development of flavor, the flavor\r\nis not directly produced by the formation of acid. If cream is treated\r\nin proper proportions with a commercial acid, as hydrochloric,[154] it\r\nassumes the same churning properties as found in normally ripened cream,\r\nbut is devoid of the desired aromatic qualities. Lactic acid[155] has\r\nalso been used in a similar way but with no better results.\r\n\r\nThe amount of acidity that should be developed under natural conditions\r\nso as to secure the optimum quality as to flavor and aroma is the most\r\nimportant question in cream ripening. Concerning this there have been\r\ntwo somewhat divergent views as to what is best in practice, some\r\nholding that better results were obtained with cream ripened to a high\r\ndegree of acidity than where a less amount was developed.[156] The\r\npresent tendency seems to be to develop somewhat more than formerly, as\r\nit is thought that this secures more of the \"high, quick\" flavor wanted\r\nin the market. On the average, cream is ripened to about 0.5 to 0.65 per\r\ncent. acidity, a higher percentage than this giving a strong-flavored\r\nbutter. In the determination of acidity, the most convenient method is\r\nto employ the Farrington alkaline tablet, which permits of an accurate\r\nand rapid estimation of the acidity in the ripening cream. The amount of\r\nacidity to be produced must of necessity be governed by the amount of\r\nbutter-fat present, for the formation of acid is confined to the serum\r\nof the cream; consequently, a rich cream would show less acid by\r\ntitration than a thinner cream, and still contain really as much acid as\r\nthe other. The importance of this factor is evident in gathered-cream\r\nfactories.\r\n\r\nThe rate of ripening is dependent upon the conditions that affect the\r\nrate of growth of bacterial life, such as time and temperature, number\r\nof organisms in cream and also the per cent of butter fat in the cream.\r\nSome years ago it was customary to ripen cream at about 50 deg. to 60 deg.\r\nF., but more recently better results have been obtained, it is claimed,\r\nwhere the ripening temperature is increased and the period of ripening\r\nlessened. As high a temperature as 70 deg. to 75 deg. F. has been\r\nrecommended. It should be said that this variation in practice may have\r\na valid scientific foundation, for the temperature of the ripening cream\r\nis undoubtedly the most potent factor in determining what kind of bacteria\r\nwill develop most luxuriantly. It is well known that those forms that\r\nare capable of producing bitter flavors are able to thrive better at a\r\nlower temperature than some of the desirable ripening species.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this factor would be lessened where a pure culture was\r\nused in pasteurized cream, because here practically the selected\r\norganism alone controls the field.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently asserted that better results are obtained by stirring\r\nthe cream and so exposing it to the air as much as possible. Experiments\r\nmade at the Ontario Agricultural College, however, show practically no\r\ndifference in the quality of the butter made by these two methods. The\r\ngreat majority of the bacteria in the cream belong to the facultative\r\nclass, and are able to grow under conditions where they are not in\r\ndirect contact with the air.\r\n\r\n~Flavor and aroma.~ The basis for the peculiar flavor or taste which\r\nripened cream-butter possesses is due, in large part, to the formation\r\nof certain decomposition products formed by various bacteria. Aroma is a\r\nquality often confounded with flavor, but this is produced by volatile\r\nproducts only, which appeal to the sense of smell rather than taste.\r\nGenerally a good flavor is accompanied by a desirable aroma, but the\r\norigin of the two qualities is not necessarily dependent on the same\r\norganisms. The quality of flavor and aroma in butter is, of course, also\r\naffected by other conditions, as, for instance, the presence or absence\r\nof salt, as well as the inherent qualities of the milk, that are\r\ncontrolled, to some extent at least, by the character of the feed which\r\nis consumed by the animal. The exact source of these desirable but\r\nevanescent qualities in butter is not yet satisfactorily determined.\r\nAccording to Storch,[157] flavors are produced by the decomposition of\r\nthe milk sugar and the absorption of the volatile flavors by the butter\r\nfat. Conn[158] holds that the nitrogenous elements in cream serve as\r\nfood for bacteria, and in the decomposition of which the desired\r\naromatic substance is produced. The change is unquestionably a complex\r\none, and cannot be explained as a single fermentation.\r\n\r\nThere is no longer much doubt but that both acid-forming and\r\ncasein-digesting species can take part in the production of proper\r\nflavors as well as desirable aromas. The researches of Conn,[159] who\r\nhas studied this question most exhaustively, indicate that both of these\r\ntypes of decomposition participate in the production of flavor and\r\naroma. He has shown that both flavor and aroma production are\r\nindependent of acid; that many good flavor-producing forms belong to\r\nthat class which renders milk alkaline, or do not change the reaction at\r\nall. Some of these species liquefied gelatin and would therefore belong\r\nto the casein-dissolving class. Those species that produced bad flavors\r\nare also included in both fermentative types. Conn has found a number of\r\norganisms that are favorable flavor-producers; in fact they were much\r\nmore numerous than desirable aroma-yielding species. None of the\r\nfavorable aroma forms according to his investigations were lactic-acid\r\nspecies,--a view which is also shared by Weigmann.[160]\r\n\r\nMcDonnell[161] has found that the production of aroma in certain cases\r\nvaries at different temperatures, the most pronounced being evolved near\r\nthe optimum growing temperature, which, as a general rule, is too high\r\nfor cream ripening.\r\n\r\nThe majority of bacteria in ripening cream do not seem to exert any\r\nmarked influence in butter. A considerable number of species are\r\npositively beneficial, inasmuch as they produce a good flavor or aroma.\r\nA more limited number are concerned in the production of undesirable\r\nripening changes. This condition being true, it may seem strange that\r\nbutter is as good as it is, because so frequently the requisite care is\r\nnot given to the development of proper ripening. In all probability the\r\nchief reason why this is so is that those bacteria that find milk and\r\ncream pre-eminently suited to their development, e. g. the lactic-acid\r\nclass, are either neutral or beneficial in their effect on butter.\r\n\r\n~Use of starters.~ Experience has amply demonstrated that it is possible\r\nto control the nature of the fermentative changes that occur in ripening\r\ncream to such an extent as to materially improve the quality of the\r\nbutter. This is frequently done by the addition of a \"starter.\" While\r\nstarters have been employed for many years for the purpose mentioned, it\r\nis only recently that their nature has been understood. A starter may be\r\nselected from widely divergent sources, but in all cases it is sure to\r\ncontain a large number of bacteria, and the presumption is that they are\r\nof such a nature as to produce desirable fermentative changes in the\r\ncream.\r\n\r\nIn the selection of these so-called natural starters, it follows that\r\nthey must be chosen under such conditions as experience has shown to\r\ngive favorable results. For this purpose, whole milk from a single\r\nanimal is often used where the same is observed to sour with the\r\nproduction of no gas or other undesirable taint. A skim-milk starter\r\nfrom a mixed supply is recommended by many. Butter milk is frequently\r\nemployed, but in the opinion of butter experts is not as suitable as the\r\nothers mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt not infrequently happens that the practical operator may be misled in\r\nselecting a starter that is not desirable, or by continuing its use\r\nafter it has become contaminated.\r\n\r\nIn 1890[162] a new system of cream ripening was introduced in Denmark by\r\nStorch that possesses the merit of being a truly scientific and at the\r\nsame time practical method. This consisted in the use of pure cultures\r\nof specific organisms that were selected on account of their ability to\r\nproduce a desirable ripening change in cream. The introduction of these\r\nso-called culture starters has become universal in Denmark, and in parts\r\nof Germany. Their use is also rapidly extending in this country,\r\nAustralia and New Zealand.\r\n\r\n~Principles of pure-culture cream-ripening.~ In the proper use of pure\r\ncultures for ripening cream, it is necessary first to eliminate as far\r\nas possible the bacteria already present in cream before the culture\r\nstarter is added. This result is accomplished by heating the cream to a\r\ntemperature sufficiently high to destroy the vegetating organisms. The\r\naddition of a properly selected starter will then give the chosen\r\norganism such an impetus as will generally enable it to gain the\r\nascendency over any other bacteria and so control the character of the\r\nripening. The principle employed is quite like that practiced in raising\r\ngrain. The farmer prepares his soil by plowing, in this way killing the\r\nweeds. Then he sows his selected grain, which is merely a pure culture,\r\nand by the rapid growth of this, other forms are held in check.\r\n\r\nThe attempt has been made to use these culture starters in raw sweet\r\ncream, but it can scarcely be expected that the most beneficial results\r\nwill be attained in this way. This method has been justified on the\r\nbasis of the following experiments. Where cream is pasteurized and no\r\nstarter is added, the spore-bearing forms frequently produce undesirable\r\nflavors. These can almost always be controlled if a culture starter is\r\nadded, the obnoxious form being repressed by the presence of the added\r\nstarter. This condition is interpreted as indicating that the addition\r\nof a starter to cream which already contains developing bacteria will\r\nprevent those originally present in the cream from growing.[163] This\r\nrepressive action of one species on another is a well-known\r\nbacteriological fact, but it must be remembered that such an explanation\r\nis only applicable in those cases where the culture organism is better\r\nable to develop than those forms that already exist in the cream.\r\n\r\nIf the culture organism is added to raw milk or cream which already\r\ncontains a flora that is well suited to develop in this medium, it is\r\nquite doubtful whether it would gain the supremacy in the ripening\r\ncream. The above method of adding a culture to raw cream renders\r\ncream-ripening details less burdensome, but at the same time Danish\r\nexperience, which is entitled to most credence on this question, is\r\nopposed to this method.\r\n\r\n~Reputed advantages of culture starters.~ _1. Flavor and aroma._ Naturally\r\nthe flavor produced by pure-culture ferments depends upon the character\r\nof the organism used. Those which are most extensively used are able to\r\nproduce a perfectly clean but mild flavor, and a delicate but not\r\npronounced aroma. The \"high, quick\" flavor and aroma that is so much\r\ndesired in the American market is not readily obtained by the use of\r\ncultures. It is quite problematical whether the use of any single\r\nspecies will give any more marked aroma than normally occurs in natural\r\nripening.\r\n\r\n_2. Uniformity of product._ Culture starters produce a more uniform\r\nproduct because the type of fermentation is under more complete control,\r\nand herein is the greatest advantage to be derived from their use. Even\r\nthe best butter-maker at times will fail to secure uniform results if\r\nhis starter is not perfectly satisfactory.\r\n\r\n_3. Keeping quality of product._ Butter made from pasteurized cream to\r\nwhich a pure-culture starter has been added will keep much better than\r\nthe ordinary product, because the diversity of the bacterial flora is\r\nless and the milk is therefore not so likely to contain those organisms\r\nthat produce an \"off\" condition.\r\n\r\n_4. Elimination of taints._ Many defective conditions in butter are\r\nattributable to the growth of undesirable bacteria in the cream that\r\nresult in the formation of \"off\" flavors and taints. If cream is\r\npasteurized, thereby destroying these organisms, then ripened with pure\r\nferments, it is generally possible to eliminate the abnormal\r\nconditions.[164] Taints may also be present in cream due to direct\r\nabsorption from the cow or through exposure to foul odors.[165] Troubles\r\nof this sort may thus be carried over to the butter. This is\r\nparticularly true in regions where leeks and wild onions abound, as in\r\nsome of the Atlantic States. The heating of the cream tends to expel\r\nthese volatile taints, so that a fairly good article of butter can be\r\nmade from what would otherwise be a relatively worthless product.\r\n\r\n~Characteristics desired in culture starters.~ Certain conditions as the\r\nfollowing are desirable in starters made from pure cultures:\r\n\r\n1. Vigorous growth in milk at ordinary ripening temperatures.\r\n\r\n2. Ability to form acid so as to facilitate churning and increase the\r\nyield of butter.\r\n\r\n3. Able to produce a clean flavor and desirable aroma.\r\n\r\n4. Impart a good keeping quality to butter.\r\n\r\n5. Not easily modified in its flavor-producing qualities by artificial\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nThese different conditions are difficult to attain, for the reason that\r\nsome of them seem to be in part incompatible. Weigmann[166] found that a\r\ngood aroma was generally an evanescent property, and therefore opposed\r\nto good keeping quality. Conn has shown that the functions of\r\nacid-formation, flavor and aroma production are not necessarily related,\r\nand therefore the chances of finding a single organism that possesses\r\nall the desirable attributes are not very good.\r\n\r\nIn all probability no one germ possesses all of these desirable\r\nqualities, but natural ripening is the resultant of the action of\r\nseveral forms.[167] This idea has led to the attempt at mixing selected\r\norganisms that have been chosen on account of certain favorable\r\ncharacteristics which they might possess. The difficulty of maintaining\r\nsuch a composite culture in its correct proportions when it is\r\npropagated in the creamery is seemingly well nigh insuperable, as one\r\norganism is very apt to develop more or less rapidly than the other.\r\n\r\nA very satisfactory way in which these cultures are marketed is to mix\r\nthe bacterial growth with some sterile, inert, dry substance. This is\r\nthe method used in most of the Danish cultures. In this country, some of\r\nthe more prominent cultures employed are marketed in a liquid form.\r\n\r\n~Culture vs. home-made starters.~ One great advantage which has accrued\r\nfrom the use of culture or commercial starters has been that in\r\nemphasizing the need of closer control of the ripening process, greater\r\nattention has been paid to the carrying out of the details. In the\r\nhands of the better operators, the differences in flavor of butter made\r\nwith a culture or a natural starter are not marked,[168] but in the\r\nhands of those who fail to make a good product under ordinary\r\nconditions, an improvement is often secured where a commercial culture\r\nis used.\r\n\r\n~Pasteurization as applied to butter-making.~ This process, as applied to\r\nbutter making, is often confounded with the treatment of milk and cream\r\nfor direct consumption. It is unfortunate that the same term is used in\r\nconnection with the two methods, for they have but little in common\r\nexcept in the use of heat to destroy the germ life of the milk. In\r\npasteurizing cream for butter-making, it is not necessary to observe the\r\nstringent precautions that are to be noted in the preservation of milk;\r\nfor the addition of a rapidly developing starter controls at once the\r\nfermentative changes that subsequently occur. Then again, the physical\r\nrequirement as to the production of a cooked taste is not so stringent\r\nin butter-making. While a cooked taste is imparted to milk or even cream\r\nat about 158 deg. F., it is possible to make butter that shows no\r\npermanent cooked taste from cream that has been raised as high as 185\r\ndeg. or even 195 deg. F. This is due to the fact that the fat does not\r\nreadily take up those substances that give to scalded milk its peculiar\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\nUnless care is taken in the manipulation of the heated cream, the grain\r\nor body of the butter may be injured. This tendency can be overcome if\r\nthe ripened cream is chilled to 48 deg. F. for about two hours before\r\nchurning. It is also essential that the heated cream should be quickly\r\nand thoroughly chilled after being pasteurized.\r\n\r\nThe Danes, who were the first to employ pasteurization in butter-making,\r\nused, in the beginning, a temperature ranging from 158 deg. to 167 deg.\r\nF., but owing to the prevalence of such diseases as tuberculosis and\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease, it became necessary to treat all of the skim\r\nmilk that was returned from the creameries. For this purpose the skim\r\nmilk is heated to a temperature of 176 deg. F., it having been more\r\nrecently determined that this degree of heat is sufficient to destroy the\r\nseeds of disease. With the use of this higher temperature the capacity of\r\nthe pasteurizing apparatus is considerably reduced, but the higher\r\ntemperature is rendered necessary by the prevailing conditions as to\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nWhen the system was first introduced in Denmark, two methods of\r\nprocedure were followed: the whole milk was heated to a sufficiently\r\nhigh temperature to thoroughly pasteurize it before it was separated, or\r\nit was separated first, and the cream pasteurized afterwards. In the\r\nlatter case, it is necessary to heat the skim milk after separation to\r\ndestroy the disease organisms, but this can be quickly done by the use\r\nof steam directly. Much more care must be used in heating the cream in\r\norder to prevent injury to the grain of the butter. In spite of the\r\nextra trouble of heating the cream and skim milk separately, this method\r\nhas practically supplanted the single heating. With the continual spread\r\nof tuberculosis in America the heating of skim milk separately is\r\nbeginning to be introduced.[169]\r\n\r\n~Use of starters in pasteurized and unpasteurized cream.~ In order to\r\nsecure the beneficial results presumably attributable to the use of a\r\nstarter, natural as well as a pure culture, it should be employed in\r\ncream in which the bacteria have first been killed out by\r\npasteurization. This is certainly the most logical and scientific method\r\nand is the way in which the process has been developed in Denmark.\r\n\r\nHere in this country, the use of pure cultures has been quite rapidly\r\nextended, but the system of heating the cream has been used in only a\r\nslight measure. The increased labor and expense incurred in pasteurizing\r\nthe cream has naturally militated somewhat against the wide-spread use\r\nof the process, but doubtless the main factor has been the inability to\r\nsecure as high a flavor where the cream was heated as in the unheated\r\nproduct. As the demands of the market change from a high, quick flavor\r\nto one that is somewhat milder but of better keeping quality, doubtless\r\npasteurization of the cream will become more and more popular. That such\r\na change is gradually occurring is already evident, although as yet only\r\na small proportion of butter made in this country is now made in this\r\nway. Where the cream is unheated, a considerable number of species will\r\nbe found, and even the addition of a pure culture, if that culture is of\r\nthe lactic acid-producing species, will to some extent control the type\r\nof fermentation that occurs. Such would not be the case with a culture\r\ncomposed of the casein-digesting type of bacteria. Only those forms\r\ncould thus be used which are especially well suited to development in\r\nraw cream. For this reason the pure culture ferments that are generally\r\nemployed in creamery practice are organisms of the lactic acid type,\r\nable to grow rapidly in cream and produce a pure cream flavor in the\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n~Purity of commercial starters.~ Naturally the butter maker is forced to\r\nrely on the laboratory for his commercial starter, and the question will\r\noften arise as to the purity and vigor of the various ferments employed.\r\nAs there is no way for the factory operator to ascertain the actual\r\ncondition of the starter, except by using the same, the greatest care\r\nshould be taken by the manufacturer to insure the absolute purity of the\r\nseed used.\r\n\r\nA bacteriological examination of the various cultures which have been\r\nplaced on the market not infrequently reveals an impure condition. In\r\nseveral cases the writer has found a not inconsiderable number of\r\nliquefying bacteria mixed with the selected organism. Molds not\r\ninfrequently are found in cultures put up in the dry form. Doubtless the\r\neffect of these accidental contaminations is considerably less in the\r\ncase of a starter composed of a distinctively lactic acid-producing\r\norganism than with a form which is less capable of thriving vigorously\r\nin milk, and it should be said that these impurities can frequently be\r\neliminated by continued propagation.\r\n\r\nThe virility and vigor of the starter is also a fluctuating factor,\r\ndependent in part at least, upon the conditions under which the organism\r\nis grown. In some cases the germ is cultivated in solutions in which\r\nacid cannot be formed in abundance. Where the conditions permit of the\r\nformation of acid, as would be the case if sugar was present with a\r\nlactic acid-producing species, the vitality of the culture is often\r\nimpaired by the action of the gradually accumulating acid. Some\r\nmanufacturers attempt to minimize this deleterious condition by adding\r\ncarbonate of lime which unites with the acid that is formed.\r\n\r\n~Propagation of starters for cream-ripening.~ The preparation and\r\npropagation of a starter for cream-ripening is a process involving\r\nconsiderable bacteriological knowledge, whether the starter is of\r\ndomestic origin or prepared from a pure-culture ferment. In any event,\r\nit is necessary that the starter should be handled in a way so as to\r\nprevent the introduction of foreign bacteria as far as possible. It\r\nshould be remembered at all times that the starter is a live thing and\r\nmust be handled throughout its entire history in a way so as to retain\r\nits vitality and vigor unimpaired. The following points should be taken\r\ninto consideration in growing the starter and transferring it from day\r\nto day:\r\n\r\n1. If a commercial starter is used, see that it is fresh and that the\r\nseal has not been broken. If the culture is too old, the larger part of\r\nthe organisms may have died out before it is transferred, in which case\r\nthe effect of its addition to the sterilized milk would be of little\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nWhen the commercial ferment is received, it should be stored in the\r\nrefrigerator pending its use so as to retard as much as possible the\r\nchanges that naturally go on in the culture liquid. Be careful that the\r\nbottle is not exposed to the influence of direct sunlight for in a\r\ntransparent medium the organisms may be readily killed by the\r\ndisinfecting action of the sun's rays.\r\n\r\n2. If a home-made starter is employed, use the greatest possible care in\r\nselecting the milk that is to be used as a basis for the starter.\r\n\r\n3. For the propagation and perpetuation of the starter from day to day,\r\nit is necessary that the same should be grown in milk that is as\r\ngerm-free as it is possible to secure it. For this purpose sterilize\r\nsome fresh skim-milk in a covered can that has previously been well\r\nsteamed. This can be done easily by setting cans containing skim-milk in\r\na vat filled with water and heating the same to 180 deg. F. or above for\r\none-half hour or more. Steam should not be introduced directly. This\r\nprocess destroys all but a few of the most resistant spore-bearing\r\norganisms. This will give a cooked flavor to the milk, but will not\r\naffect the cream to which the starter is added. Dairy supply houses are\r\nnow introducing the use of starter cans that are specially made for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n4. After the heated milk is cooled down to about 70 deg. or 80 deg. F.,\r\nit can be inoculated with the desired culture. Sometimes it is desirable\r\nto \"build up\" the starter by propagating it first in a smaller volume of\r\nmilk, and then after this has developed, adding it to a larger amount.\r\n\r\nThis method is of particular value where a large amount of starter is\r\nneeded for the cream-ripening.\r\n\r\n5. After the milk has been inoculated, it should be kept at a\r\ntemperature that is suitable for the rapid development of the contained\r\nbacteria, 65 deg.-75 deg. F., which temperature should be kept as uniform\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nThis can best be done by setting the covered can in a vat filled with\r\nwarm water. The starter cans are often arranged so that temperature can\r\nbe controlled by circulating water.\r\n\r\n6. The starter should not be too thoroughly curdled when it is needed\r\nfor use, but should be well soured and only partially curdled for it is\r\ndifficult to break up thoroughly the curd particles if the starter is\r\ncompletely curdled. If these curd masses are added to ripening cream,\r\nwhite specks may appear in the butter.\r\n\r\n7. The vigor of the starter is in all probability stronger when the milk\r\nis on the point of curdling than it is after the curd has been formed\r\nsome time. The continued formation of lactic acid kills many of the\r\nbacteria and thus weakens the fermentative action. It is therefore\r\nhighly important that the acidity of the starter should be closely\r\nwatched.\r\n\r\n8. Do not refrigerate the starter when it has reached the proper stage\r\nof development, as this retards the bacterial growth in the same manner\r\nas cold weather checks the growth of grain. It is preferable to dilute\r\nthe starter, if it cannot be used when ready, with sufficient freshly\r\nsterilized sweet milk to hold the acidity at the proper point and thus\r\nkeep the bacteria in the starter in a condition which will favor\r\nvigorous growth.\r\n\r\n9. The starter should be propagated from day to day by adding a small\r\nquantity to a new lot of freshly prepared milk. For this purpose two\r\npropagating cans should be provided so that one starter may be in use\r\nwhile the other is being prepared.\r\n\r\n~How long should a starter be propagated?~ No hard-and-fast rule can be\r\ngiven for this, for it depends largely upon how carefully the starter is\r\nhandled during its propagation. If the starter is grown in sterilized\r\nmilk kept in steamed vessels and is handled with sterile dippers, it is\r\npossible to maintain it in a state of relative purity for a considerable\r\nperiod of time; if, however, no especial care is given, it will soon\r\nbecome infected by the air, and the retention of its purity will depend\r\nmore upon the ability of the contained organism to choke out foreign\r\ngrowths than upon any other factor. Experience seems to indicate that\r\npure-culture starters \"run out\" sooner than domestic starters. While it\r\nis possible, by bacteriological methods, to determine with accuracy the\r\nactual condition of a starter as to its germ content, still such methods\r\nare inapplicable in creamery practice. Here the maker must rely largely\r\nupon the general appearance of the starter as determined by taste and\r\nsmell. The supply houses that deal in cultures of this class generally\r\nexpect to supply a new culture at least every month.\r\n\r\n~Bacteria in butter.~ As ripened cream is necessarily rich in bacteria, it\r\nfollows that butter will also contain germ life in varying amounts, but\r\nas butter-fat is not well adapted for bacterial food, the number of\r\ngerms in butter is usually less than in ripened cream.\r\n\r\nSweet-cream butter is naturally poorer in germ life than that made from\r\nripened cream. Grotenfelt reports in sweet-cream butter, the so-called\r\n\"Paris butter,\" only a few bacteria while in acid cream butter the germ\r\ncontent runs from scores to hundreds of thousands.\r\n\r\n~Effect of bacteria in wash water.~ An important factor in contamination\r\nmay be the wash water that is used. Much carelessness often prevails\r\nregarding the location and drainage of the creamery well, and if same\r\nbecomes polluted with organic matter, bacterial growth goes on apace.\r\nMelick[170] has made some interesting studies on using pasteurized and\r\nsterilized well waters for washing. He found a direct relation to exist\r\nbetween the bacterial content of the wash water and the keeping quality\r\nof the butter. Some creameries have tried filtered water but under\r\nordinary conditions a filter, unless it is tended to with great\r\nregularity, becomes a source of infection rather than otherwise.\r\n\r\n~Changes in germ content.~ The bacteria that are incorporated with the\r\nbutter as it first \"comes\" undergo a slight increase for the first few\r\ndays. The duration of this period of increase is dependent largely upon\r\nthe condition of the butter. If the buttermilk is well worked out of the\r\nbutter, the increase is slight and lasts for a few days only, while the\r\npresence of so nutritious a medium as buttermilk affords conditions much\r\nmore favorable for the continued growth of the organisms.\r\n\r\nWhile there may be many varieties in butter when it is fresh, they are\r\nvery soon reduced in kind as well as number. The lactic acid group of\r\norganisms disappear quite rapidly; the spore-bearing species remaining\r\nfor a somewhat longer time. Butter examined after it is several months\r\nold is often found to be almost free from germs.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of butter there is much that is dependent upon the\r\nmechanical processes of churning, washing, salting and working the\r\nproduct. These processes do not involve any bacteriological principles\r\nother than those that are incident to cleanliness. The cream, if ripened\r\nproperly, will contain such enormous numbers of favorable forms that the\r\naccess of the few organisms that are derived from the churn, the air, or\r\nthe water in washing will have little effect, unless the conditions are\r\nabnormal.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTERIAL DEFECTS IN BUTTER.\r\n\r\n~Rancid change in butter.~ Fresh butter has a peculiar aroma that is very\r\ndesirable and one that enhances the market price, if it can be retained;\r\nbut this delicate flavor is more or less evanescent, soon disappearing,\r\neven in the best makes. While a good butter loses with age some of the\r\npeculiar aroma that it possesses when first made, yet a gilt-edged\r\nproduct should retain its good keeping qualities for some length of\r\ntime. All butters, however, sooner or later undergo a change that\r\nrenders them worthless for table use. This change is usually a rancidity\r\nthat is observed in all stale products of this class. The cause of this\r\nrancid condition in butter was at first attributed to the formation of\r\nbutyric acid, but it is now recognized that other changes also enter\r\nin.[171] Light and especially air also exert a marked effect on the\r\nflavor of butter. Where butter is kept in small packages it is much more\r\nprone to develop off flavors than when packed in large tubs. From the\r\ncarefully executed experiments of Jensen it appears that some of the\r\nmolds as well as certain species of bacteria are able to incite these\r\nchanges. These organisms are common in the air and water and it\r\ntherefore readily follows that inoculation occurs.\r\n\r\nPractically, rancidity is held in check by storing butter at low\r\ntemperatures where germ growth is quite suspended.\r\n\r\n~Lack of flavor.~ Often this may be due to improper handling of the cream\r\nin not allowing it to ripen far enough, but sometimes it is impossible\r\nto produce a high flavor. The lack of flavor in this case is due to the\r\nabsence of the proper flavor-producing organisms. This condition can\r\nusually be overcome by the addition of a proper starter.\r\n\r\n~Putrid butter.~ This specific butter trouble has been observed in\r\nDenmark, where it has been studied by Jensen.[172] Butter affected by it\r\nrapidly acquires a peculiar putrid odor that ruins it for table use.\r\nSometimes, this flavor may be developed in the cream previous to\r\nchurning.\r\n\r\nJensen found the trouble to be due to several different putrefactive\r\nbacteria. One form which he called _Bacillus foetidus lactis_, a close\r\nally of the common feces bacillus, produced this rotten odor and taste\r\nin milk in a very short time. Fortunately, this organism was easily\r\nkilled by a comparatively low heat, so that pasteurization of the cream\r\nand use of a culture starter quickly eliminated the trouble, where it\r\nwas tried.\r\n\r\n~Turnip-flavored butter.~ Butter sometimes acquires a peculiar flavor\r\nrecalling the order of turnips, rutabagas, and other root crops. Often\r\nthis trouble is due to feeding, there being in several of these crops,\r\naromatic substances that pass directly into the milk, but in some\r\ninstances the trouble arises from bacteria that are able to produce\r\ndecomposition products,[173] the odor and taste of which strongly\r\nrecalls these vegetables.\r\n\r\n~\"Cowy\" butter.~ Frequently there is to be noted in milk a peculiar odor\r\nthat resembles that of the cow stable. Usually this defect in milk has\r\nbeen ascribed to the absorption of impure gases by the milk as it cools,\r\nalthough the gases and odors naturally present in fresh milk have this\r\npeculiar property that is demonstrable by certain methods of aeration.\r\nOccasionally it is transmitted to butter, and recently Pammel[174] has\r\nisolated from butter a bacillus that produced in milk the same peculiar\r\nodor so commonly present in stables.\r\n\r\n~Lardy and tallowy butter.~ The presence of this unpleasant taste in\r\nbutter may be due to a variety of causes. In some instances, improper\r\nfood seems to be the source of the trouble; then again, butter exposed\r\nto direct sunlight bleaches in color and develops a lardy flavor.[175]\r\nIn addition to these, cases have been found in which the defect has been\r\ntraced to the action of bacteria. Storch[176] has described a\r\nlactic-acid form in a sample of tallowy butter that was able to produce\r\nthis disagreeable odor.\r\n\r\n~Oily butter.~ Jensen has isolated one of the causes of the dreaded oily\r\nbutter that is reported quite frequently in Denmark. The specific\r\norganism that he found belongs to the sour-milk bacteria. In twenty-four\r\nhours it curdles milk, the curd being solid like that of ordinary sour\r\nmilk. There is produced, however, in addition to this, an unpleasant\r\nodor and taste resembling that of machine oil, a peculiarity that is\r\ntransmitted directly to butter made from affected cream.\r\n\r\n~Bitter butter.~ Now and then butter develops a bitter taste that may be\r\ndue to a variety of different bacterial forms. In most cases, the bitter\r\nflavor in the butter is derived primarily from the bacteria present in\r\nthe cream or milk. Several of the fermentations of this character in\r\nmilk are also to be found in butter. In addition to these defects\r\nproduced by a biological cause, bitter flavors in butter are sometimes\r\nproduced by the milk being impregnated with volatile, bitter substances\r\nderived from weeds.\r\n\r\n~Moldy butter.~ This defect is perhaps the most serious because most\r\ncommon. It is produced by the development of a number of different\r\nvarieties of molds. The trouble appears most frequently in packed butter\r\non the outside of the mass of butter in contact with the tub. Mold\r\nspores are so widely disseminated that if proper conditions are given\r\nfor their germination, they are almost sure to develop. In some cases\r\nthe mold is due to the growth of the ordinary bread mold, _Penicillium\r\nglaucum_; in other cases a black mold develops, due often to\r\n_Cladosporium butyri_. Not infrequently trouble of this character is\r\nassociated with the use of parchment wrappers. The difficulty can easily\r\nbe held in check by soaking the parchment linings and the tubs in a\r\nstrong brine, or paraffining the inside of the tub.\r\n\r\n~Fishy butter.~ Considerable trouble has been experienced in Australian\r\nbutter exported to Europe in which a fishy flavor developed. It was\r\nnoted that the production of this defect seemed to be dependent upon the\r\nstorage temperature at which the butter was kept. When the butter was\r\nrefrigerated at 15 deg. F. no further difficulty was experienced. It is\r\nclaimed that the cause of this condition is due to the formation of\r\ntrimethylamine (herring brine odor) due to the growth of the mold fungus\r\n_Oidium lactis_, developing in combination with the lactic-acid\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\nA fishy taste is sometimes noted in canned butter. Rogers[177] has\r\ndetermined that this flavor is caused by yeasts (_Torula_) which produce\r\nfat-splitting enzyms capable of producing this undesirable change.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[153] Conn and Esten, Cent. f.

Within the last\r\ndecade or so, the subject has received more attention from the\r\nscientific point of view and the underlying causes determined to some\r\nextent. Since the subject has been investigated from the bacteriological\r\npoint of view, much light has been thrown on the cause of many changes\r\nthat were heretofore inexplicable. Our knowledge, as yet, is quite\r\nmeager, but enough has already been determined to indicate that the\r\nwhole industry is largely based on the phenomena of ferment action, and\r\nthat the application of bacteriological principles and ideas is sure to\r\nyield more than ordinary results, in explaining, in a rational way, the\r\nreasons underlying many of the processes to be observed in this\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe problem of good milk is a vital one in any phase of dairy activity,\r\nbut it is pre-eminently so in cheese-making, for the ability to make a\r\nfirst-class product depends to a large extent on the quality of the raw\r\nmaterial. Cheese contains so large a proportion of nitrogenous\r\nconstituents that it is admirably suited, as a food medium, to the\r\ndevelopment of bacteria; much better, in fact, than butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF BACTERIA IN NORMAL CHEESE PROCESSES.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of cheddar cheese bacteria exert a marked influence\r\nin the initial stages of the process. To produce the proper texture that\r\ncharacterizes cheddar cheese, it is necessary to develop a certain\r\namount of acid which acts upon the casein. This acidity is measured by\r\nthe development of the lactic-acid bacteria that normally abound in the\r\nmilk; or, as the cheese-maker expresses it, the milk is \"ripened\" to the\r\nproper point. The action of the rennet, which is added to precipitate\r\nthe casein of the milk, is markedly affected by the amount of acid\r\npresent, as well as the temperature. Hence it is desirable to have a\r\nstandard amount of acidity as well as a standard temperature for\r\ncoagulation, so as to unify conditions. It frequently happens that the\r\nmilk is abnormal with reference to its bacterial content, on account of\r\nthe absence of the proper lactic bacteria, or the presence of forms\r\ncapable of producing fermentative changes of an undesirable character.\r\nIn such cases the maker attempts to overcome the effect of the unwelcome\r\nbacteria by adding a \"starter;\" or he must vary his method of\r\nmanufacture to some extent to meet these new conditions.\r\n\r\n~Use of starters.~ A starter may be employed to hasten the ripening of\r\nmilk that is extremely sweet, so as to curtail the time necessary to get\r\nthe cheese to press; or it may be used to overcome the effect of\r\nabnormal conditions.\r\n\r\nThe starter that is employed is generally one of domestic origin, and is\r\nusually taken from skim milk that has been allowed to ferment and sour\r\nunder carefully controlled conditions. Of course much depends upon the\r\nquality of the starter, and in a natural starter there is always the\r\npossibility that it may not be perfectly pure.\r\n\r\nWithin recent years the attempt has been made to control the effect of\r\nthe starter more thoroughly by using pure cultures of some desirable\r\nlactic-acid form.[178] This has rendered the making of cheese not only\r\nmore uniform, but has aided in repressing abnormal fermentations\r\nparticularly those that are characterized by the production of gas.\r\n\r\nRecently, pure cultures of Adametz's _B. nobilis_, a digesting organism\r\nthat is claimed to be the cause of the breaking down of the casein and\r\nalso of the peculiar aroma of Emmenthaler cheese, has been placed on the\r\nmarket under the name _Tyrogen_. It is claimed that the use of this\r\nstarter, which is added directly to the milk and also rubbed on the\r\nsurface of the cheese, results in the improvement of the curds, assists\r\nin the development of the proper holes, imparts a favorable aroma and\r\nhastens ripening.[179]\r\n\r\nCampbell[180] states that the discoloration of cheese in England, which\r\nis due to the formation of white spots that are produced by the\r\nbleaching of the coloring matter in the cheese, may be overcome by the\r\nuse of lactic-acid starters.\r\n\r\nThe use of stringy or slimy whey has been advocated in Holland for some\r\nyears as a means of overcoming the tendency toward gas formation in Edam\r\ncheese which is made from practically sweet milk. This fermentation, the\r\nessential feature of which is produced by a culture of _Streptococcus\r\nHollandicus_,[181] develops acid in a marked degree, thereby inhibiting\r\nthe production of gas.\r\n\r\nThe use of masses of moldy bread in directing the fermentation of\r\nRoquefort cheese is another illustration of the empirical development of\r\nstarters, although in this instance it is added after the curds have\r\nbeen prepared for the press.\r\n\r\n~Pasteurizing milk for cheese-making.~ If it were possible to use properly\r\npasteurized milk in cheese-making, then practically all abnormal\r\nconditions could be controlled by the use of properly selected starters.\r\nNumerous attempts have been made to perfect this system with reference\r\nto cheddar cheese, but so far they have been attended with imperfect\r\nsuccess. The reason for this is that in pasteurizing milk, the soluble\r\nlime salts are precipitated by the action of heat, and under these\r\nconditions rennet extract does not curdle the casein in a normal manner.\r\nThis condition can be restored, in part at least, by the addition of\r\nsoluble lime salts, such as calcium chlorid; but in our experience,\r\ndesirable results were not obtained where heated milks to which this\r\ncalcium solution had been added were made into cheddar cheese.\r\nConsiderable experience has been gained in the use of heated milks in\r\nthe manufacture of certain types of foreign cheese. Klein[182] finds\r\nthat Brick cheese can be successfully made even where the milk is heated\r\nas high as 185 deg. F. An increased weight is secured by the addition of\r\nthe coagulated albumin and also increased moisture.\r\n\r\n~Bacteria in rennet.~ In the use of natural rennets, such as are\r\nfrequently employed in the making of Swiss cheese, considerable numbers\r\nof bacteria are added to the milk. Although these rennets are preserved\r\nin salt, alcohol or boric acid, they are never free from bacteria.\r\nAdametz[183] found ten different species and from 640,000 to 900,000\r\nbacteria per cc. in natural rennets. Freudenreich has shown that rennet\r\nextract solutions can be used in Swiss cheese-making quite as well as\r\nnatural rennets; but to secure the best results, a small quantity of\r\npure lactic ferment must be added to simulate the conditions that\r\nprevail when natural rennets are soaked in whey, which, it must be\r\nremembered, is a fluid rich in bacterial life.\r\n\r\nWhere rennet extract or tablets are used, as is generally the case in\r\ncheddar making, the number of bacteria added is so infinitesimal as to\r\nbe negligible.\r\n\r\n~Development of acid.~ In the manufacture of cheddar cheese, the\r\ndevelopment of acid exerts an important influence on the character of\r\nthe product. This is brought about by holding the curds at temperatures\r\nfavorable to the growth of the bacteria in the same. Under these\r\nconditions the lactic-acid organisms, which usually predominate, develop\r\nvery rapidly, producing thereby considerable quantities of acid which\r\nchange materially the texture of the curds. The lactic acid acts upon\r\nthe casein in solutions containing salt, causing it to dissolve to some\r\nextent, thus forming the initial compounds of digestion.[184] This\r\nsolution of the casein is expressed physically by the \"stringing\" of the\r\ncurds on a hot iron. This causes the curds to mat, producing a close,\r\nsolid body, free from mechanical holes. Still further, the development\r\nof this acid is necessary for the digestive activity of the pepsin in\r\nthe rennet extract.\r\n\r\nIn some varieties of cheese, as the Swiss, acid is not developed and the\r\ncharacter of the cheese is much different from that of cheddar. In all\r\nsuch varieties, a great deal more trouble is experienced from the\r\nproduction of \"gassy\" curds, because the development of the\r\ngas-producing bacteria is held in check by the rapid growth of the\r\nlactic acid-producing species.\r\n\r\n~Bacteria in green cheese.~ The conditions under which cheese is made\r\npermit of the development of bacteria throughout the entire process. The\r\ncooking or heating of curds to expel the excessive moisture is never so\r\nhigh as to be fatal to germ life; on the contrary, the acidity of the\r\ncurd and whey is continually increased by the development of bacteria in\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nThe body of green cheese fresh from the press is, to a considerable\r\nextent, dependent upon the acid produced in the curds. If the curds are\r\nput to press in a relatively sweet condition the texture is open and\r\nporous. The curd particles do not mat closely together and \"mechanical\r\nholes,\" rough and irregular in outline, occur. Very often, at relatively\r\nhigh temperatures, such cheese begin to \"huff,\" soon after being taken\r\nfrom the press, a condition due to the development of gas, produced by\r\ngas-generating bacteria acting on the sugar in the curd. This gas finds\r\nits way readily into these ragged holes, greatly distending them, as in\r\nFig. 30.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. _L_, a sweet curd cheese direct from the press.\r\n\"Mechanical\" holes due to lack of acid development; _P_, same cheese\r\nfour days later, mechanical holes distended by development of gas.]\r\n\r\n~Physical changes in ripening cheese.~ When a green cheese is taken from\r\nthe press, the curd is tough, firm, but elastic. It has no value as a\r\nfood product for immediate use, because it lacks a desirable flavor and\r\nis not readily digestible. It is nothing but precipitated casein and\r\nfat. In a short time, a deep-seated change occurs. Physically this\r\nchange is demonstrated in the modification that the curd undergoes.\r\nGradually it breaks down and becomes plastic, the elastic, tough curd\r\nbeing changed into a softened mass. This change in texture of the cheese\r\nis also accompanied by a marked change in flavor. The green cheese has\r\nno distinctively cheese flavor, but in course of time, with the gradual\r\nchange of texture, the peculiar flavor incident to ripe cheese is\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic texture and flavor are susceptible of considerable\r\nmodification that is induced not only by variation in methods of\r\nmanufacture, but by the conditions under which the cheese are cured. The\r\namount of moisture incorporated with the curd materially affects the\r\nphysical appearance of the cheese, and the rate of change in the same.\r\nThe ripening temperature, likewise the moisture content of the\r\nsurrounding air, also exerts a marked influence on the physical\r\nproperties of the cheese. To some extent the action of these forces is\r\npurely physical, as in the gradual loss by drying, but in other respects\r\nthey are associated with chemical transformations.\r\n\r\n~Chemical changes in ripening cheese.~ Coincident with the physical\r\nbreaking down of the curd comes a change in the chemical nature of the\r\ncasein. The hitherto insoluble casein is gradually transformed into\r\nsoluble nitrogenous substances (_caseone_ of Duclaux, or _caseogluten_\r\nof Weigmann). This chemical phenomenon is a breaking-down process that\r\nis analogous to the peptonization of proteids, although in addition to\r\nthe peptones and albumoses characteristic of peptic digestion,\r\namido-acids and ammonia are to be found. The quantity of these lower\r\nproducts increases with the age of the cheese.\r\n\r\nThe chemical reaction of cheese is normally acid to phenolphthalein,\r\nalthough there is generally no free acid, as shown by Congo red, the\r\nlactic acid being converted into salts as fast as formed. In very old\r\ncheese, undergoing putrefactive changes, especially on the outside, an\r\nalkaline reaction may be present, due to the formation of free ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe changes that occur in a ripening cheese are for the most part\r\nconfined to the proteids. According to most investigators the fat\r\nremains practically unchanged, although the researches of Weigmann and\r\nBacke[185] show that fatty acids are formed from the fat. In the green\r\ncheese considerable milk-sugar is present, but, as a result of the\r\nfermentation that occurs, this is rapidly converted into acid products.\r\n\r\n~Bacterial flora of cheese.~ It might naturally be expected that the green\r\ncheese, fresh from the press, would contain practically the same kind of\r\nbacteria that are in the milk, but a study of cheese shows a peculiar\r\nchange in the character of the flora. In the first place, fresh cottage\r\ncheese, made by the coagulation of the casein through the action of\r\nacid, has a more diversified flora than cheese made with rennet, for the\r\nreason, as given by Lafar,[186] that the fermentative process is farther\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nWhen different varieties of cheese are made from milk in the same\r\nlocality, the germ content of even the ripened product has a marked\r\nsimilarity, as is illustrated by Adametz's work[187] on Emmenthaler or\r\nSwiss hard cheese, and Schweitzer Hauskaese, a soft variety. Of the nine\r\nspecies of bacilli and cocci found in mature Emmenthaler, eight of them\r\nwere also present in ripened Hauskaese.\r\n\r\nDifferent investigators have studied the bacterial flora of various\r\nkinds of cheese, but as yet little comparative systematic work has been\r\ndone. Freudenreich[188] has determined the character and number of\r\nbacteria in Emmenthaler cheese, and Russell[189] the same for cheddar\r\ncheese. The same general law has also been noted in Canadian[190] and\r\nEnglish[191] cheese. At first a marked decrease in numbers is usually\r\nnoted, lasting for a day or two. This is followed by an enormous\r\nincrease, caused by the rapid growth of the lactic-acid type. The\r\ndevelopment may reach scores of millions and often over a hundred\r\nmillion organisms per gram. Synchronous with this increase, the\r\npeptonizing and gas-producing bacteria gradually disappear. This rapid\r\ndevelopment, which lasts only for a few weeks, is followed by a general\r\ndecline.\r\n\r\nIn the ripening of cheese a question arises as to whether the process\r\ngoes on throughout the entire mass of cheese, or whether it is more\r\nactive at or near the surface. In the case of many of the soft cheese,\r\nsuch as Brie and limburger, bacterial and mold development is\r\nexceedingly active on the exterior, and the enzyms secreted by these\r\norganisms diffuse toward the interior. That such a condition occurs in\r\nthe hard type of cheese made with rennet is extremely improbable. Most\r\nobservers agree that in this type of cheese the ripening progresses\r\nthroughout the entire mass, although Adametz opposes this view and\r\nconsiders that in Emmenthaler cheese the development of the specific\r\naroma-producing organism occurs in the superficial layers. Jensen has\r\nshown, however, that the greatest amount of soluble nitrogenous products\r\nare to be found in the innermost part of the cheese, a condition that is\r\nnot reconcilable with the view that the most active ripening is on the\r\nexterior.[192]\r\n\r\nThe course of development of bacteria in cheddar cheese is materially\r\ninfluenced by the ripening temperature. In cheese ripened at relatively\r\nlow temperatures (50 deg.-55 deg. F.),[193] a high germ content is\r\nmaintained for a much longer period of time than at higher temperatures.\r\nUnder these conditions the lactic-acid type continues in the ascendancy\r\nas usual. In cheese cured at high temperatures (80 deg.-86 deg. F.) the\r\nnumber of organisms is greatly diminished, and they fail to persist in\r\nappreciable numbers for as long a time as in cheese cured at temperatures\r\nmore frequently employed.\r\n\r\n~Influence of temperature on curing.~ Temperature exerts a most potent\r\ninfluence on the quality of the cheese, as determined not only by the\r\nrate of ripening but the nature of the process itself. Much of the poor\r\nquality of cheese is attributable to the effect of improper curing\r\nconditions. Probably in the initial stage of this industry cheese were\r\nallowed to ripen without any sort of control, with the inevitable result\r\nthat during the summer months the temperature generally fluctuated so\r\nmuch as to impair seriously the quality. The effect of high temperatures\r\n(70 deg. F. and above) is to produce a rapid curing, and, therefore, a\r\nshort lived cheese; also a sharp, strong flavor, and generally a more or\r\nless open texture. Unless the cheese is made from the best quality of\r\nmilk, it is very apt to undergo abnormal fermentations, more especially\r\nthose of a gassy character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31. Influence of curing temperature on texture of\r\ncheese. Upper row ripened eight months at 60 deg. F.; lower row at 40\r\ndeg. F.]\r\n\r\nWhere cheese is ripened at low temperatures, ranging from 50 deg. F. down\r\nto nearly the freezing temperatures, it is found that the quality is\r\ngreatly improved.[194] Such cheese are thoroughly broken down from a\r\nphysical point of view even though they may not show such a high per\r\ncent of soluble nitrogenous products. They have an excellent texture,\r\ngenerally solid and firm, free from all tendency to openness; and,\r\nmoreover, their flavor is clean and entirely devoid of the sharp,\r\nundesirable tang that so frequently appears in old cheese. The keeping\r\nquality of such cheese is much superior to the ordinary product. The\r\nintroduction of this new system of cheese-curing promises much from a\r\npractical point of view, and undoubtedly a more complete study of the\r\nsubject from a scientific point of view will aid materially in\r\nunraveling some of the problems as to flavor production.\r\n\r\n~Theories of cheese curing.~ Within the last few years considerable study\r\nhas been given the subject of cheese curing or ripening, in order to\r\nexplain how this physical and chemical transformation is brought about.\r\n\r\nMuch of the misconception that has arisen relative to the cause of\r\ncheese ripening comes from a confusion of terms. In the ordinary use of\r\nthe word, ripening or curing of cheese is intended to signify the sum\r\ntotal of all the changes that result in converting the green product as\r\nit comes from the press into the edible substance that is known as cured\r\ncheese. As previously shown, the most marked chemical transformation\r\nthat occurs is that which has to do with the peptonization or breaking\r\ndown of the casein. It is true that under ordinary conditions this\r\ndecomposition process is also accompanied with the formation of certain\r\nflavor-producing substances, more or less aromatic in character; but it\r\nby no means follows that these two processes are necessarily due to the\r\nsame cause. The majority of investigators have failed to consider these\r\ntwo questions of casein decomposition and flavor as independent, or at\r\nleast as not necessarily related. They are undoubtedly closely bound\r\ntogether, but it will be shown later that the problems are quite\r\ndifferent and possibly susceptible of more thorough understanding when\r\nconsidered separately.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier theories of cheese ripening it was thought to be purely a\r\nchemical change, but, with the growth of bacteriological science,\r\nevidence was forthcoming that seemed to indicate that the activity of\r\norganisms entered into the problem. Schaffer[195] showed that if milk\r\nwas boiled and made into cheese, the casein failed to break down.\r\nAdametz[196] added to green cheese various disinfectants, as creolin and\r\nthymol, and found that this practically stopped the curing process. From\r\nthese experiments he drew the conclusion that bacteria must be the cause\r\nof the change, because these organisms were killed; but when it is\r\nconsidered that such treatment would also destroy the activity of enzyms\r\nas well as vital ferments, it is evident that these experiments were\r\nquite indecisive.\r\n\r\nA determination of the nature of the by-products found in maturing\r\ncheese indicates that the general character of the ripening change is a\r\npeptonization or digestion of the casein.\r\n\r\nUntil recently the most widely accepted views relating to the cause of\r\nthis change have been those which ascribed the transformation to the\r\nactivity of micro-organisms, although concerning the nature of these\r\norganisms there has been no unanimity of opinion. The overwhelming\r\ndevelopment of bacteria in all cheeses naturally gave support to this\r\nview; and such experiments as detailed above strengthened the idea that\r\nthe casein transformation could not occur where these ferment organisms\r\nwere destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe very nature of the changes produced in the casein signified that to\r\ntake part in this process any organism must possess the property of\r\ndissolving the proteid molecule, casein, and forming therefrom\r\nby-products that are most generally found in other digestive or\r\npeptonizing changes of this class.\r\n\r\n~Digestive bacterial theory.~ The first theory propounded was that of\r\nDuclaux,[197] who in 1887 advanced the idea that this change was due to\r\nthat type of bacteria which is able to liquefy gelatin, peptonize milk,\r\nand cause a hydrolytic change in proteids. To this widely-spread group\r\nthat he found in cheese, he gave the generic name _Tyrothrix_ (cheese\r\nhairs). According to him, these organisms do not function directly as\r\nripening agents, but they secrete an enzym or unorganized ferment to\r\nwhich he applies the name _casease_. This ferment acts upon the casein\r\nof milk, converting it into a soluble product known as _caseone_. These\r\norganisms are found in normal milk, and if they function as casein\r\ntransformers, one would naturally expect them to be present, at least\r\nfrequently, if not predominating in the ripening cheese; but such is not\r\nthe case. In typical cheddar or Swiss cheese, they rapidly disappear (p.\r\n168), although in the moister, softer varieties, they persist for\r\nconsiderable periods of time. According to Freudenreich, even where\r\nthese organisms are added in large numbers to the curd, they soon\r\nperish, an observation that is not regarded as correct by the later\r\nadherents to the digestive bacterial theory, as Adametz and Winkler.\r\n\r\nDuclaux's experiments were made with liquid media for isolation\r\npurposes, and his work, therefore, cannot be regarded as satisfactory as\r\nthat carried out with more modern technical methods. Recently this\r\ntheory has been revived by Adametz,[198] who claims to have found in\r\nEmmenthaler cheese a digesting species, one of the Tyrothrix type, which\r\nis capable of peptonizing the casein and at the same time producing the\r\ncharacteristic flavor of this class of cheese. This organism, called by\r\nhim _Bacillus nobilis_, the Edelpilz of Emmenthaler cheese, has been\r\nsubjected to comparative experiments, and in the cheese made with pure\r\ncultures of this germ better results are claimed to have been secured.\r\nSufficient experiments have not as yet been reported by other\r\ninvestigators to warrant the acceptance of the claims made relative to\r\nthe effect of this organism.\r\n\r\n~Lactic-acid bacterial theory.~ It has already been shown that the\r\nlactic-acid bacteria seems to find in the green cheese the optimum\r\nconditions of development; that they increase enormously in numbers for\r\na short period, and then finally decline. This marked development,\r\ncoincident with the breaking down of the casein, has led to the view\r\nwhich has been so ably expounded by Freudenreich[199] that this type of\r\nbacterial action is concerned in the ripening of cheese. This group of\r\nbacteria is, under ordinary conditions, unable to liquefy gelatin, or\r\ndigest milk, or, in fact, to exert, under ordinary conditions, any\r\nproteolytic or peptonizing properties. This has been the stumbling-block\r\nto the acceptance of this hypothesis, as an explanation of the breaking\r\ndown of the casein. Freudenreich has recently carried on experiments\r\nwhich he believes solve the problem. By growing cultures of these\r\norganisms in milk, to which sterile, freshly precipitated chalk had been\r\nadded, he was able to prolong the development of bacteria for a\r\nconsiderable period of time, and as a result finds that an appreciable\r\npart of the casein is digested; but this action is so slow compared with\r\nwhat normally occurs in a cheese, that exception may well be taken to\r\nthis type of experiment alone. Weigmann[200] inclines to the view that\r\nthe lactic-acid bacteria are not the true cause of the peptonizing\r\nprocess, but that their development prepares the soil, as it were, for\r\nthose forms that are more directly concerned in the peptonizing process.\r\nThis they do by developing an acid substratum that renders possible the\r\nmore luxuriant growth of the aroma-producing species. According to\r\nGorini,[201] certain of the Tyrothrix forms function at high\r\ntemperatures as lactic acid producing bacteria, while at lower\r\ntemperatures they act as peptonizers. On this basis he seeks to\r\nreconcile the discrepancies that appear in the experiments of other\r\ninvestigators.\r\n\r\n~Digestive milk enzym theory.~ In 1897 Babcock and the writer[202] showed\r\nthat milk underwent digestive changes spontaneously when bacterial\r\nactivity was suspended by the addition of such anaesthetics as ether,\r\nchloroform and benzol. The chemical nature of the by-products produced\r\nby this auto-digestion of milk resembles quite closely those found in\r\nripened cheese, except that ammonia is not produced as is the case in\r\nold cheese. The cause of the decomposition of the casein, they found to\r\nbe due to the action of a milk enzym which is inherent to the milk\r\nitself. This digestive ferment may be separated from fresh milk by\r\nconcentrating centrifuge slime extracts by the usual physiological\r\nreagents. This ferment, called by them _galactase_, on account of its\r\norigin in milk, is a proteolytic enzym of the tryptic type. Its activity\r\nis destroyed by strong chemicals such as formaldehyde, corrosive\r\nsublimate, also when heated to 175 deg. F. or above. When such extracts\r\nare added to boiled milk, the digestive process is started anew, and the\r\nby-products produced are very similar to those noted in a normal cheese.\r\n\r\nJensen[203] has also shown that the addition of pancreatic extracts to\r\ncheese accelerated the formation of soluble nitrogenous products.\r\n\r\nThe action of galactase in milk and cheese has been confirmed by\r\nFreudenreich[204] and Jensen,[205] as well as by American investigators,\r\nand this enzym is now generally accepted as one of the factors concerned\r\nin the decomposition of the casein. Freudenreich believes it is able to\r\nchange casein into albumose and peptones, but that the lactic-acid\r\nbacteria are chiefly responsible for the further decomposition of the\r\nnitrogen to amid form.\r\n\r\nFailure before to recognize the presence of galactase in milk is\r\nattributable to the fact that all attempts to secure sterile milk had\r\nbeen made by heating the same, in which case galactase was necessarily\r\ndestroyed. A brief exposure at 176 deg. F. is sufficient to destroy its\r\nactivity, and even an exposure at lower temperatures weakens its action\r\nconsiderably, especially if the reaction of the medium is acid. This\r\nundoubtedly explains the contradictory results obtained in the ripening\r\nof cheese from pasteurized milk, such cheese occasionally breaking down\r\nin an abnormal manner.\r\n\r\nThe results mentioned on page 172, in which cheese failed to ripen when\r\ntreated with disinfectants,--experiments which were supposed at that\r\ntime to be the foundation of the bacterial theory of casein\r\ndigestion--are now explicable on an entirely different basis. In these\r\ncases the casein was not peptonized, because these strong disinfectants\r\ndestroyed the activity of the enzyms as well as the bacteria.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor in the breaking down of the casein is the\r\n_pepsin_ in the rennet extract. The digestive influence of this agent\r\nwas first demonstrated for cheddar cheese by Babcock, Russell and\r\nVivian,[206] and simultaneously, although independently, by Jensen[207]\r\nin Emmenthaler cheese. In this digestive action, only albumoses and\r\nhigher peptones are produced. The activity of pepsin does not become\r\nmanifest until there is about 0.3 per cent. acid which is approximately\r\nthe amount developed in the cheddar process. These two factors\r\nundoubtedly account for by far the larger proportion of the changes in\r\nthe casein; and yet, the formation of ammonia in well ripened cheese is\r\nnot accounted for by these factors. This by-product is the main end\r\nproduct of proteid digestion by the liquefying bacteria but their\r\napparent infrequency in cheese makes it difficult to understand how they\r\ncan function prominently in the change, unless the small quantity of\r\ndigestive enzyms excreted by them in their growth in milk is capable of\r\ncontinuing its action until a cumulative effect is obtained. Although\r\nmuch light has been thrown on this question by the researches of the\r\nlast few years, the matter is far from being satisfactorily settled at\r\nthe present time and the subject needs much more critical work. If\r\nliquefying bacteria abound in the milk, doubtless they exert some\r\naction, but the role of bacteria is doubtless much greater in the\r\nproduction of flavor than in the decomposition of the curd.\r\n\r\n~Conditions determining quality.~ In determining the quality of cheese,\r\nseveral factors are to be taken into consideration. First and foremost\r\nis the flavor, which determines more than anything else the value of the\r\nproduct. This should be mild and pleasant, although with age the\r\nintensity of the same generally increases but at no time should it have\r\nany bitter, sour, or otherwise undesirable taste or aroma. Texture\r\nregisters more accurately the physical nature of the ripening. The\r\ncheese should not be curdy and harsh, but should yield quite readily to\r\npressure under the thumb, becoming on manipulation waxy and plastic\r\ninstead of crumbly or mealy. Body refers to the openness or closeness of\r\nthe curd particles, a close, compact mass being most desirable. The\r\ncolor of cheese should be even, not wavy, streaked or bleached.\r\n\r\nFor a cheese to possess all of these characteristics in an optimum\r\ndegree is to be perfect in every respect--a condition that is rarely\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nSo many factors influence this condition that the problem of making a\r\nperfect cheese becomes exceedingly difficult. Not only must the quality\r\nof the milk--the raw material to be used in the manufacture--be\r\nperfectly satisfactory, but the factory management while the curds are\r\nin the vat demands great skill and careful attention; and finally, the\r\nlong period of curing in which variation in temperature or moisture\r\nconditions may seriously affect the quality,--all of these stages, more\r\nor less critical, must be successfully gone through, before the product\r\nreaches its highest state of development.\r\n\r\nIt is of course true that many phases of this complex series of\r\nprocesses have no direct relation to bacteria, yet it frequently happens\r\nthat the result attained is influenced at some preceding stage by the\r\naction of bacteria in one way or another. Thus the influence of the\r\nacidity developed in the curds is felt throughout the whole life of the\r\ncheese, an over-development of lactic-acid bacteria producing a sour\r\ncondition that leaves its impress not only on flavor but texture. An\r\ninsufficient development of acid fails to soften the curd-particles so\r\nas to permit of close matting, the consequence being that the body of\r\nthe cheese remains loose and open, a condition favorable to the\r\ndevelopment of gas-generating organisms.\r\n\r\n~Production of flavor.~ The importance of flavor as determining the\r\nquality of cheese makes it imperative that the nature of the substances\r\nthat confer on cheese its peculiar aromatic qualities and taste be\r\nthoroughly understood. It is to be regretted that the results obtained\r\nso far are not more satisfactory, for improvement in technique is hardly\r\nto be expected until the reason for the process is thoroughly\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe view that is most generally accepted is that this most important\r\nphase of cheese curing is dependent upon bacterial activity, but the\r\norganisms that are concerned in this process have not as yet been\r\nsatisfactorily determined. In a number of cases, different species of\r\nbacteria have been separated from milk and cheese that have the power of\r\nproducing aromatic compounds that resemble, in some cases, the peculiar\r\nflavors and odors that characterize some of the foreign kinds of cheese;\r\nbut an introduction of these into curd has not resulted in the\r\nproduction of the peculiar variety, even though the methods of\r\nmanufacture and curing were closely followed. The similarity in germ\r\ncontent in different varieties of cheese made in the same locality has\r\nperhaps a bearing on this question of flavor as related to bacteria. Of\r\nthe nine different species of bacteria found in Emmenthaler cheese by\r\nAdametz, eight of them were also present in ripened Hauskaese. If\r\nspecific flavors are solely the result of specific bacterial action, it\r\nmight naturally be expected that the character of the flora would\r\ndiffer.\r\n\r\nSome suggestive experiments were made by Babcock and Russell on the\r\nquestion of flavor as related to bacterial growth, by changing the\r\nnature of the environment in cheese by washing the curds on the racks\r\nwith warm water. In this way the sugar and most of the ash were removed.\r\nUnder such conditions the character of the bacterial flora was\r\nmaterially modified. While the liquefying type of bacteria was very\r\nsparse in normal cheddar, they developed luxuriantly in the washed\r\ncheese. The flavor at the same time was markedly affected. The control\r\ncheddar was of good quality, while that made from the washed curds was\r\ndecidedly off, and in the course of ripening became vile. It may be\r\nthese two results are simply coincidences, but other data[208] bear out\r\nthe view that the flavor was to some extent related to the nature of the\r\nbacteria developing in the cheese. This was strengthened materially by\r\nadding different sugars to washed curds, in which case it was found that\r\nthe flavor was much improved, while the more normal lactic-acid type of\r\nbacteria again became predominant.\r\n\r\n~Ripening of moldy cheese.~ In a number of foreign cheeses, the peculiar\r\nflavor obtained is in part due to the action of various fungi which grow\r\nin the cheese, and there produce certain by-products that flavor the\r\ncheese. Among the most important of these are the Roquefort cheese of\r\nFrance, Stilton of England, and Gorgonzola of Italy.\r\n\r\nRoquefort cheese is made from goat's or cow's milk, and in order to\r\nintroduce the desired mold, which is the ordinary bread-mold,\r\n_Penicillium glaucum_, carefully-prepared moldy bread-crumbs are added\r\nto the curd.\r\n\r\nAt ordinary temperatures this organism develops too rapidly, so that the\r\ncheese to ripen properly must be kept at a low temperature. The town of\r\nRoquefort is situated in a limestone country, in a region full of\r\ncaves, and it is in these natural caves that most of the ripening is\r\ndone. These caverns are always very moist and have a temperature ranging\r\nfrom 35 deg. to 44 deg. F., so that the growth of the fungus is retarded\r\nconsiderably. The spread of the mold throughout the ripening mass is\r\nalso assisted in a mechanical way. The partially-matured cheese are run\r\nthrough a machine that pricks them full of small holes. These slender\r\ncanals allow the mold organism to penetrate the whole mass more\r\nthoroughly, the moldy straw matting upon which the ripening cheese are\r\nplaced helping to furnish an abundant seeding of the desired germ.\r\n\r\nWhen new factories are constructed it is of advantage to introduce this\r\nnecessary germ in quantities, and the practice is sometimes followed of\r\nrubbing the walls and cellars of the new location with material taken\r\nfrom the old established factory. In this custom, developed in purely an\r\nempirical manner, is to be seen a striking illustration of a\r\nbacteriological process crudely carried out.\r\n\r\nIn the Stilton cheese, one of the highly prized moldy cheeses of\r\nEngland, the desired mold fungus is introduced into the green cheese by\r\nexchanging plugs taken with a cheese trier from a ripe Stilton.\r\n\r\n~Ripening of soft cheese.~ The type of ripening which takes place in the\r\nsoft cheeses is materially different from that which occurs in the hard\r\ntype. The peptonizing action does not go on uniformly throughout the\r\ncheese, but is hastened by the development of molds and bacteria on the\r\noutside that exert a solvent action on the casein. For this reason, soft\r\ncheeses are usually made up in small sizes, so that this action may be\r\nhastened. The organisms that take part in this process are those that\r\nare able to form enzyms (similar in their action to trypsin, galactase,\r\netc.), and these soluble ferments gradually diffuse from the outside\r\nthrough the cheese.\r\n\r\nMost of these peptonizing bacteria are hindered in their growth by the\r\npresence of lactic acid, so that in many cases the appearance of the\r\ndigesting organisms on the surface is delayed until the acidity of the\r\nmass is reduced to the proper point by the development of other\r\norganisms, principally molds, which prefer an acid substratum for their\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nIn Brie cheese a blue coating of mold develops on the surface. In the\r\ncourse of a few weeks, a white felting appears which later changes to\r\nred. This slimy coat below the mold layer is made up of diverse species\r\nof bacteria and fungi that are able to grow after the acid is reduced by\r\nthe blue mold. The organisms in the red slimy coat act upon the casein,\r\nproducing an alkaline reaction that is unfavorable to the growth of the\r\nblue mold. Two sets of organisms are, therefore essential in the\r\nripening process, one preparing the soil for the ferment that later\r\nproduces the requisite ripening changes. As ordinarily carried on, the\r\nprocess is an empirical one, and if the red coat does not develop as\r\nexpected, the maker resorts to all kinds of devices to bring out the\r\ndesired ferment. The appearance of the right form is dependent, however,\r\nupon the proper reaction of the cheese, and if this is not suitable, the\r\nwished-for growth will not appear.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF BACTERIA IN ABNORMAL CHEESE PROCESSES.\r\n\r\nThe reason why cheese is more subject to abnormal fermentation than\r\nbutter is because its high nitrogen content favors the continued\r\ndevelopment of bacteria for some time after it is made. It must be\r\nborne in mind, in considering the more important of these changes, that\r\nnot all defective conditions in cheese are attributable to the influence\r\nof living organisms. Troubles frequently arise from errors in\r\nmanufacturing details, as too prolonged cooking of curds, too high\r\nheating, or the development of insufficient or too much acid. Then\r\nagain, the production of undesirable flavors or impairment in texture\r\nmay arise from imperfect curing conditions.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge regarding the exact nature of these indefinite faults is\r\nas yet too inadequate to enable many of these undesirable conditions to\r\nbe traced to their proper source; but in many cases the taints observed\r\nin a factory are due to the abnormal development of certain bacteria,\r\ncapable of evolving unpleasant or even putrid odors. Most of them are\r\nseeded in the milk before it comes to the factory and are due to\r\ncareless manipulation of the milk while it is still on the farm. Others\r\ngain access to the milk in the factory, owing to unclean conditions of\r\none sort or another. Sometimes the cheese-maker is able to overcome\r\nthese taints by vigorous treatment, but often they pass on into the\r\ncheese, only to detract from the market value of the product. Most\r\nfrequently these \"off\" flavors appear in cheese that are cured at too\r\nhigh temperatures, say above 65 deg. F.\r\n\r\n~\"Gassy\" fermentations in cheese.~ One of the worst and at the same time\r\nmost common troubles in cheese-making is where the cheese undergoes a\r\nfermentation marked by the evolution of gas. The presence of gas is\r\nrecognized by the appearance either of spherical or lens-shaped holes of\r\nvarious sizes in the green cheese; often they appear in the curd before\r\nit is put to press. Usually in this condition the curds look as if they\r\nhad been punctured with a pin, and are known as \"pin holey\" curds. Where\r\nthe gas holes are larger, they are known as \"Swiss holes\" from their\r\nresemblance to the normal holes in the Swiss product. If the development\r\nof gas is abundant, these holes are restricted in size. Often the\r\nformation of gas may be so intense as to cause the curds to float on the\r\nsurface of the whey before they are removed. Such curds are known as\r\n\"floaters\" or \"bloaters.\"\r\n\r\nIf \"gassy\" curds are put to press, the abnormal fermentation may\r\ncontinue. The further production of gas causes the green cheese to\r\n\"huff\" or swell, until it may be considerably distorted as in Fig. 33.\r\nIn such cases the texture of the cheese is greatly injured, and the\r\nflavor is generally impaired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33. Cheese made from gassy milk.]\r\n\r\nSuch abnormal changes may occur at any season of the year, but the\r\ntrouble is most common in summer, especially in the latter part.\r\n\r\nThis defect is less likely to occur in cheese that is well cheddared\r\nthan in sweet curd cheese. When acidity is produced, these gassy\r\nfermentations are checked, and in good cheddar the body is so close and\r\nfirm as not readily to permit of gaseous changes.\r\n\r\nIn Swiss cheese, which is essentially a sweet curd cheese, these\r\nfermentations are very troublesome. Where large holes are formed in\r\nabundance (blaehen), the trouble reaches its maximum. If the gas holes\r\nare very numerous and therefore small it is called a \"nissler.\"\r\nSometimes the normal \"eyes\" are even wanting when it is said to be\r\n\"blind\" or a \"glaesler.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34. Block Swiss cheese showing \"gassy\"\r\nfermentation.]\r\n\r\nOne method of procedure which is likely to cause trouble in Swiss\r\nfactories is often produced by the use of sour, fermented whey in which\r\nto soak the natural rennets. Freudenreich and Steinegger[209] have shown\r\nthat a much more uniform quality of cheese can be made with rennet\r\nextract if it is prepared with a starter made from a pure lactic\r\nferment.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the difficulty has long been charged to various sources,\r\nsuch as a lack of aeration, improper feeding, retention of animal gases,\r\netc., but in all these cases it was nothing more than a surmise. Very\r\noften the milk does not betray any visible symptom of fermentation when\r\nreceived, and the trouble is not to be recognized until the process of\r\ncheese-making is well advanced.\r\n\r\nStudies from a biological standpoint have, however, thrown much light on\r\nthis troublesome problem; and it is now known that the formation of gas,\r\neither in the curd or after it has been put to press, is due entirely to\r\nthe breaking down of certain elements, such as the sugar of milk, due to\r\nthe influence of various living germs. This trouble is, then, a type\r\nfermentation, and is, therefore, much more widely distributed than it\r\nwould be if it was caused by a single specific organism. These\r\ngas-producing organisms are to be found, sparingly at least, in almost\r\nall milks, but are normally held in check by the ordinary lactic\r\nspecies. Among them are a large number of the bacteria, although yeasts\r\nand allied germs are often present and are likewise able to set up\r\nfermentative changes of this sort. In these cases the milk-sugar is\r\ndecomposed in such a way as to give off CO_{2} and H, and in some cases,\r\nalcohol. Russell and Hastings[210] found a lactose-splitting yeast in a\r\nsevere outbreak of gassy cheese in a Swiss factory. In this case the gas\r\ndid not develop until the cheese were a few weeks old. In severe cases\r\nthe cheese actually cracked to pieces.\r\n\r\nAccording to Guillebeau, a close relation exists between those germs\r\nthat are able to produce an infectious inflammation (mastitis) in the\r\nudder of the cow and some forms capable of gas evolution.\r\n\r\nIf pure cultures of these gas-producing bacteria are added to perfectly\r\nsweet milk, it is possible to artificially produce the conditions in\r\ncheese that so frequently appear in practice.\r\n\r\n~Treatment of \"pin-holey\" curds.~ When this type of fermentation appears\r\nduring the manufacture of the cheese, the maker can control it in part\r\nwithin certain limits. These methods of treatment are, as a rule, purely\r\nmechanical, as when the curds are piled and turned, and subsequently\r\nground in a curd mill. After the gas has been forced out, the curds are\r\nthen put to press and the whole mats into a compact mass.\r\n\r\nAnother method of treatment based upon bacteriological principles is the\r\naddition of a starter to induce the formation of acid. Where acid is\r\ndeveloped as a result of the growth of the lactic-acid bacteria, the\r\ngas-producing species do not readily thrive. Another reason why acid\r\naids in repressing the development of gas is that the curd particles are\r\npartially softened or digested by the action of the acid. This causes\r\nthem to mat together more closely, and there is not left in the cheese\r\nthe irregular mechanical openings in which the developing gas may find\r\nlodgment.\r\n\r\nAnother method that is also useful with these curds is to employ salt.\r\nThis represses gaseous fermentations, and the use of more salt than\r\nusual in making the cheese will very often restrain the production of\r\ngas. Tendency to form gas in Edam cheese is controlled by the addition\r\nof a starter prepared from slimy whey (lange wei) which is caused by the\r\ndevelopment of an acid-forming organism.\r\n\r\nSome have recommended the custom of washing the curds to remove the whey\r\nand the gas-producing bacteria contained therein. Care must be taken not\r\nto carry this too far, for the removal of the sugar permits\r\ntaint-producing organisms to thrive.[211]\r\n\r\nThe temperature at which the cheese is cured also materially affects the\r\ndevelopment of gas. At high curing temperatures, gas-producing organisms\r\ndevelop rapidly; therefore more trouble is experienced in summer than at\r\nother seasons.\r\n\r\nIf milks which are prone to undergo \"gassy\" development are excluded\r\nfrom the general supply, it would be possible to eliminate the source of\r\nthe entire trouble. To aid in the early recognition of such milks that\r\nare not apparently affected when brought to the factory, fermentation or\r\ncurd tests (p. 76) are of great value. The use of this test in the hands\r\nof the factory operator often enables him to detect the exact source of\r\nthe trouble, which may frequently be confined to the milk delivered by a\r\nsingle patron.\r\n\r\n~\"Fruity\" or \"sweet\" flavor.~ Not infrequently the product of a factory\r\nmay acquire during the process of ripening what is known as a \"sweet\" or\r\n\"fruity\" flavor. This flavor resembles the odor of fermented fruit or\r\nthe bouquet of certain kinds of wine. It has been noted in widely\r\ndifferent sections of the country and its presence bears no relation to\r\nthe other qualities of the cheese. The cause of this trouble has\r\nrecently been traced[212] to the presence of various kinds of yeasts.\r\nOrdinarily yeasts are rarely present in good cheese, but in cheese\r\naffected with this trouble they abound. The addition of starters made\r\nfrom yeast cultures resulted in the production of the undesirable\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n~Mottled cheese.~ The color of cheese is sometimes cut to that extent that\r\nthe cheese presents a wavy or mottled appearance. This condition is apt\r\nto appear if the ripening temperature is somewhat high, or larger\r\nquantities of rennet used than usual. The cause of the defect is\r\nobscure, but it has been demonstrated that the same is communicable if a\r\nstarter is made by grating some of this mottled cheese into milk. The\r\nbacteriology of the trouble has not yet been worked out, but the defect\r\nis undoubtedly due to an organism that is able to grow in the ripening\r\ncheese. It has been claimed that the use of a pure lactic ferment as a\r\nstarter enables one to overcome this defect.\r\n\r\n~Bitter cheese.~ Bitter flavors are sometimes developed in cheese\r\nespecially where the ripening process is carried on at a low temperature\r\nin the presence of an excess of moisture for a considerable length of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nGuillebeau[213] isolated several forms from Emmenthaler cheese which he\r\nconnected with udder inflammation that were able to produce a bitter\r\nsubstance in cheese.\r\n\r\nVon Freudenreich[214] has described a new form _Micrococcus casei amari_\r\n(micrococcus of bitter cheese) that was found in a sample of bitter\r\ncheese. This germ is closely related to Conn's micrococcus of bitter\r\nmilk. It develops lactic acid rapidly, coagulating the milk and\r\nproducing an intensely bitter taste in the course of one to three days.\r\nWhen milk infected with this organism is made into cheese, there is\r\nformed in a few days a decomposition product that imparts a marked\r\nbitter flavor to the cheese.\r\n\r\nHarrison[215] has recently found a yeast that grows in the milk and also\r\nin the cheese which produces an undesirable bitter change.\r\n\r\nIt is peculiar that some of the organisms that are able to produce\r\nbitter products in milk do not retain this property when the milk is\r\nworked up into cheese.\r\n\r\n~Putrid or rotten cheese.~ Sometimes cheese undergoes a putrefactive\r\ndecomposition in which the texture is profoundly modified and various\r\nfoul smelling gases are evolved. These often begin on the exterior as\r\nsmall circumscribed spots that slowly extend into the cheese, changing\r\nthe casein into a soft slimy mass. Then, again, the interior of the\r\ncheese undergoes this slimy decomposition. The soft varieties are more\r\nprone toward this fermentation than the hard, although the firm cheeses\r\nare by no means exempt from the trouble. The \"Verlaufen\" or \"running\" of\r\nlimburger cheese is a fermentation allied to this. It is where the\r\ninside of the cheese breaks down into a soft semi-fluid mass. In severe\r\ncases, the rind may even be ruptured, in which case the whole interior\r\nof the cheese flows out as a thick slimy mass, having sometimes a putrid\r\nodor. The conditions favoring this putrid decomposition are usually\r\nassociated with an excess of moisture, and an abnormally low ripening\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n~Rusty spot.~ This name is applied to the development of small\r\nyellowish-red or orange spots that are formed sometimes throughout the\r\nwhole mass of cheddar cheese. A close inspection shows the colored\r\npoints to be located along the edges of the curd particles. According to\r\nHarding,[216] this trouble is most common in spring and fall. The cause\r\nof the difficulty has been traced by Connell[217] to the development of\r\na chromogenic bacterium, _Bacillus rudensis_. The organism can be most\r\nreadily isolated on a potato surface rather than with the usual\r\nisolating media, agar or gelatin.\r\n\r\n~Other pigment changes.~ Occasionally, with the hard type of cheese, but\r\nmore frequently with the softer foreign varieties, various abnormal\r\nconditions arise that are marked by the production of different pigments\r\nin or on the cheese. More frequently these are merely superficial and\r\naffect only the outer layers of the cheese. Generally they are\r\nattributable to the development of certain chromogenic organisms\r\n(bacteria, molds and yeasts), although occasionally due to other causes,\r\nas in the case of a blue discoloration sometimes noted in foreign cheese\r\nmade in copper kettles.[218]\r\n\r\nDe Vries[219] has described a blue condition that is found in Edam\r\ncheese. It appears first as a small blue spot on the inside, increasing\r\nrapidly in size until the whole mass is affected. This defect he was\r\nable to show was produced by a pigment-forming organism, _B.\r\ncyaneo-fuscus_. By the use of slimy whey (lange wei) this abnormal\r\nchange was controlled.\r\n\r\n~Moldy cheese.~ With many varieties of cheese, especially some of the\r\nforeign types, the presence of mold on the exterior is not regarded as\r\ndetrimental; in fact a limited development is much desired. In hard\r\nrennet cheese as cheddar or Swiss, the market demands a product free\r\nfrom mold, although it should be said that this condition is imposed by\r\nthe desire to secure a good-looking cheese rather than any injury in\r\nflavor that the mold causes. Mold spores are so widely distributed that,\r\nif proper temperature and moisture conditions prevail, these spores will\r\nalways develop. At temperatures in the neighborhood of 40 deg. F. and\r\nbelow, mold growth is exceedingly slow, and often fructification does\r\nnot occur, the only evidence of the mold being the white, felt-like\r\ncovering that is made up of the vegetating filaments. The use of\r\nparaffin has been suggested as a means of overcoming this growth, the\r\ncheese being dipped at an early stage into melted paraffin. Recent\r\nexperiments have shown that \"off\" flavors sometimes develop where cheese\r\nare paraffined directly from the press. If paraffin is too hard, it has\r\na tendency to crack and separate from the rind, thus allowing molds to\r\ndevelop beneath the paraffin coat, where the conditions are ideal as to\r\nmoisture, for evaporation is excluded and the air consequently\r\nsaturated. The use of formalin (2% solution) has been suggested as a\r\nwash for the outside of the cheese. This substance or sulfur is also\r\napplied in a gaseous form. Double bandaging is also resorted to as a\r\nmeans of making the cheese more presentable through the removal of the\r\nouter bandage.\r\n\r\nThe nature of these molds has not been thoroughly studied as yet. The\r\nordinary blue-green bread mold, _Penicillium glaucum_, is most\r\nfrequently found, but there are numerous other forms that appear,\r\nespecially at low temperatures.\r\n\r\n~Poisonous cheese.~ Cases of acute poisoning arising from the ingestion of\r\ncheese are reported from time to time. Vaughan has succeeded in showing\r\nthat this condition is due to the formation of a highly poisonous\r\nalkaloid which he has isolated, and which he calls _tyrotoxicon_.[220]\r\nThis poisonous ptomaine has also been demonstrated in milk and other\r\nmilk products, and is undoubtedly due to the development of various\r\nputrefactive bacteria that find their way into the milk. It seems quite\r\nprobable that the development of these toxic organisms can also go on\r\nin the cheese after it is taken from the press.\r\n\r\n~Prevention or cheese defects.~ The defective conditions previously\r\nreferred to can rarely be overcome in cheese so as to improve the\r\naffected product, for they only become manifest in most cases during the\r\nlater stages of the curing process. The only remedy against future loss\r\nis to recognize the conditions that are apt to prevail during the\r\noccurrence of an outbreak and see that the cheese are handled in such a\r\nway as to prevent a recurrence of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nMany abnormal and undesirable results are incident to the manufacture of\r\nthe product, such as \"sour\" or \"mealy\" cheese, conditions due to the\r\ndevelopment of too much acid in the milk or too high a \"cook.\" These are\r\nunder the direct control of the maker and for them he alone is\r\nresponsible. The development of taints due to the growth of unwelcome\r\nbacteria that have gained access to the milk while it is yet on the farm\r\nare generally beyond the control of the cheese maker, unless they are so\r\npronounced as to appear during the handling of the curds. If this does\r\noccur he is sometimes able, through the intervention of a starter or by\r\nvarying some detail in making, to handle the milk in such a way as to\r\nminimize the trouble, but rarely is he able to eliminate it entirely.\r\n\r\nOne of the most strenuous duties which the maker must perform at all\r\ntimes is to point out to his patrons the absolute necessity of their\r\nhandling the milk in such a way as to prevent the introduction of\r\norganisms of a baleful type.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[178] Russell, 13 Rept.
