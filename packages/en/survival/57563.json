Passages may also be\r\n    granted to farm lads (between 16 and 20 years of age) on payment of\r\n    £1 before sailing, the balance of the passage money (£6) to be paid\r\n    by monthly instalments within six months after their arrival in\r\n    Queensland. Employment is guaranteed in every case, and the lads\r\n    must consent to work on a farm for, at least, twelve months.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Queensland Offers.\r\n\r\n        An easy living to any industrious man or woman in the\r\n    healthiest climate in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Queensland Wants.\r\n\r\n        Thousands of able-bodied men and women to fill up her empty\r\n    spaces and develop her resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployment.\r\n\r\n        Agricultural labourers and domestic servants are in great\r\n    demand at good rates of wages.

Total area under\r\n    crops, 747,814 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\nFruit.\r\n\r\n        Both tropical, sub-tropical, and deciduous fruits do well.\r\n    Thirty years ago out of every 100 cases of oranges imported into\r\n    Queensland 95 came from New South Wales. Now the citrus fruit\r\n    industry has grown to such an extent that Queensland does not\r\n    import 5 per cent., but has become a big exporter to Southern\r\n    centres.\r\n\r\n\r\nPineapples.\r\n\r\n        Pineapples grow all the year round in Queensland.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere are Fruits Principally Grown?\r\n\r\n        Deciduous fruits principally at Stanthorpe. Bananas, oranges,\r\n    mangoes, citrus fruits, tomatoes, &c., in the North. Pineapples,\r\n    oranges, and citrus fruit (in large quantities), peaches, bananas,\r\n    passion fruit, melons, custard apples, &c., in the South. The\r\n    Blackall Range and Cleveland have also become great\r\n    strawberry-producing districts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere are the Crops and Products Raised?\r\n\r\n        Cereals, root crops, fodder plants, tobacco, cotton, English\r\n    and sub-tropical fruits in the South. Sugar-cane, bananas, coffee,\r\n    tobacco, cotton, and tropical products in the North. Wool on the\r\n    Darling Downs and the great grazing districts west of the Main\r\n    Range.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Mean Annual Rainfall?\r\n\r\n        It varies considerably. Along the Pacific slope it runs\r\n    approximately from 48 inches at Brisbane to 150 inches in the Far\r\n    North. West of the Great Dividing Range the rainfall diminishes\r\n    from 30 inches to about 10 inches, according to the distance from\r\n    the Main Range.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Climate Like?\r\n\r\n        The climate of Queensland is the most perfect winter season in\r\n    the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut is not the Heat Great in Summer?\r\n\r\n        Although there are occasional hot days, the summer season is\r\n    not unpleasant. The mean summer temperatures are:—South\r\n    Queensland, from 66.5 to 76.7; Central, 80.5; South-western, 80.8;\r\n    North, 81.2; North-western, 84.3.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it Healthy?\r\n\r\n        The death-rate in Queensland in 1913 was only 10.39 per 1,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut does the Climate Suit English and European People?\r\n\r\n        Yes. They live to a great age in the genial atmosphere of\r\n    Queensland.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Sort of People are already Settled in Queensland?\r\n\r\n        Scotch, Irish, English, Welsh, Germans, Danes, Italians,\r\n    Swedes, Russians, and other people of White nationalities.\r\n    Russians, Swedes, and Danes make splendid colonists, and are warmly\r\n    welcomed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo People Often Return after Leaving Queensland?\r\n\r\n        Yes. Men who go home with the intention of spending the rest of\r\n    their lives in England are constantly returning to Queensland.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Openings are there in Queensland for the Investor?\r\n\r\n        There are numerous avenues of investment in sheep and cattle\r\n    stations, farming and dairying on a large scale, city and country\r\n    properties, mines and timber, in the development of secondary\r\n    industries, and in the growing of rubber.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Man with Small Capital on Government Land?\r\n\r\n        With £150 to £200 a man can start dairying in a small way, and\r\n    gradually increase his herd and operations. A good deal, of course,\r\n    depends on the man.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuppose he had £250 or £300?\r\n\r\n        He could make a good start with that.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuppose he tried Fruit Growing?\r\n\r\n        With about £100 he could make a start. He could grow vegetables\r\n    and minor crops until his trees grew old enough to bear, which\r\n    would be in about three years from planting.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat could a Man do without Capital?\r\n\r\n        He could work for a station-owner or farmer until he had made\r\n    enough to pay his deposit on the land he eventually selects.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperienced Agricultural Labourers.\r\n\r\n        There is a great demand for this class.\r\n\r\n\r\nInexperienced Men.\r\n\r\n        Inexperienced men should take some employment and learn the\r\n    methods of work in Queensland before sinking their capital in land\r\n    or stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nDomestic Servants.\r\n\r\n        Domestic servants, especially cooks, are in urgent demand at\r\n    wages ranging from 10s. to 30s. per week.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Can Government Land be Obtained?\r\n\r\n        There are fifty-eight Land Agents’ Districts in Queensland, in\r\n    all of which vacant Crown lands are still obtainable.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgricultural Farms.\r\n\r\n        Agricultural farms vary from 10s. per acre upwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt what Age can a Person Select Land?\r\n\r\n        Over the age of 16 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan a Man with Little Capital acquire Land?\r\n\r\n        Yes. If he pays the first deposit, the Crown may defer payment\r\n    of the next three years’ rent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen is this Payable?\r\n\r\n        It is divided over the fifth to the thirteenth year with\r\n    interest at 4 per cent. per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan a Single Woman hold Government Land?\r\n\r\n        Yes; with the exception of a homestead area, if she is over 16\r\n    years.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan She hold a Homestead Area?\r\n\r\n        Yes; if she is over 21 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Land may Married Women hold from the Crown?\r\n\r\n        She may hold any selection not subject to personal residence\r\n    conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Land a Married Woman cannot select from the Crown.\r\n\r\n        A married woman is not competent to select an agricultural\r\n    homestead, a grazing homestead, free homestead, perpetual lease\r\n    selection, agricultural farm, or prickly-pear selection, subject to\r\n    the conditions of personal residence, unless she has obtained an\r\n    order for judicial separation, or an order protecting her separate\r\n    property.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarried Women’s Property Act.\r\n\r\n        Under “_The Married Women’s Property Act, 1890_,” she can\r\n    hold any land, which she purchases absolutely, as if she were a\r\n    man.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the Modes of Tenure?\r\n\r\n        (1) Agricultural selection—i.e., agricultural farms,\r\n            agricultural homesteads, perpetual lease selections, and\r\n            free homesteads.\r\n        (2) Grazing selections—i.e., grazing farms and grazing\r\n            homesteads.\r\n        (3) Unconditional selections.\r\n        (4) Prickly-pear selections.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty Years’ Purchase without Interest.\r\n\r\n        Twenty years are allowed in which to pay for an agricultural\r\n    farm. No interest is charged.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Instalment.\r\n\r\n        The annual instalment is 6d. in the £1—that is, 2-1/2 per\r\n    cent., or 3d. per acre on 10s. land; 6d. per acre on £1 land; 1s.\r\n    per acre on £2 land. The whole of this goes to principal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompleting the Purchase.\r\n\r\n        At above rate, in twenty years the farm is half paid for, and\r\n    during that time the farmer has had the use of the farm for much\r\n    less than a fair rental. At the end of the twenty-first year, he is\r\n    expected to pay the remaining half. Taking money as worth 5 per\r\n    cent., this is equivalent to selling the land at half the\r\n    proclaimed price.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeposit Money.\r\n\r\n        On an agricultural farm, agricultural homestead, perpetual\r\n    lease selection, grazing selection, and unconditional selection\r\n    —one year’s rent, and 1/5th of survey fee; on free homestead—fee\r\n    of £1, and 1/5th of survey fee; on prickly-pear selection—full\r\n    amount of survey fee.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Deposit on an Agricultural Farm of 160 Acres?\r\n\r\n        £3 16s., taking the price of the land at 10s. per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen can such a Farm be made Freehold?\r\n\r\n        In five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreehold Title.\r\n\r\n        Queensland offers an unencumbered freehold title. The deeds\r\n    for an agricultural farm may be obtained at any time after five\r\n    years by paying the outstanding balance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscount.\r\n\r\n        If such balance is paid off before it is due, a discount of\r\n    2-1/2 per cent. per annum is allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nConditions for Agricultural Farms.\r\n\r\n        Maximum area, 2,560 acres (this, however, is allowed only in\r\n    remote districts); price, from 10s. per acre upwards. The land must\r\n    be fenced within five years, or other improvements effected equal\r\n    in value to the cost of fencing. Five years’ personal residence or\r\n    occupation as the case may require; thereafter, until made\r\n    freehold, the condition of occupation must be performed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNegotiable Leases.\r\n\r\n        The lease may be obtained as soon as the improvements are\r\n    completed, and can be mortgaged, or, with the permission of the\r\n    Minister, the land may be subdivided, transferred, or sublet.\r\n\r\n\r\nExceptions.\r\n\r\n        Agricultural homesteads and free homesteads cannot be\r\n    mortgaged. Agricultural selections and prickly-pear selections\r\n    obtained under five years’ residence priority cannot be mortgaged\r\n    during the first five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgricultural Homesteads.\r\n\r\n        The price for a homestead is 2s. 6d. per acre, the annual rent\r\n    3d. per acre, the terms ten years’ personal residence, and the\r\n    maximum area 320 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgricultural Homestead Conditions.\r\n\r\n        Land must be fenced within five years, or improvements made\r\n    equal to value of such fence. When five years of residence have\r\n    been performed and improvements effected, the selector may pay up\r\n    the remaining rent, so as to make his total payments equal to 2s.\r\n    6d. per acre, and obtain deed of grant.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrazing Farms—Area.\r\n\r\n        The total area held by one person must not exceed 60,000 acres,\r\n    but when the area exceeds 20,000 acres the annual rental at the\r\n    notified rental must not exceed £200.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrazing Farms—Rental, Term, Conditions, &c.\r\n\r\n        Rental from nil per acre per annum. Term up to twenty-eight\r\n    years. The holding must be continuously occupied by the selector or\r\n    manager or agent. Within three years the land must be fenced. In\r\n    cases where no rental is charged, the land is more or less infested\r\n    with prickly pear or noxious weeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrazing Farms—Lease.\r\n\r\n        As soon as the holding is fenced the lease is issued, which may\r\n    be mortgaged or transferred, as stated in the case of agricultural\r\n    farms.\r\n\r\n\r\nGroup Residence.\r\n\r\n        If it is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that\r\n    two or more selections, each of which is at a distance not\r\n    exceeding five miles from each of the others, are held by members\r\n    of one family, _bonâ fide_ in their own separate interests,\r\n    the Commissioner may issue a special license enabling the\r\n    conditions of personal residence or the conditions of occupation\r\n    required to be performed by them in respect of their selections to\r\n    be performed by their residence on one of the selections which is\r\n    itself held subject to the conditions of personal residence or\r\n    conditions of occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrazing Homesteads—\r\n\r\n        Similar conditions to grazing farms, except that—\r\n\r\n            (1) Selector must personally reside on the land for five\r\n                years.\r\n\r\n            (2) Before the expiration of five years from the\r\n                commencement of the term, or the death of the original\r\n                lessee, whichever first happens, the land cannot be\r\n                assigned or transferred, but may be mortgaged with the\r\n                consent of the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnconditional Selections—\r\n\r\n        Up to 1,280 acres may be obtained under this tenure, at from\r\n    13s. 4d. per acre, payable in twenty annual instalments without\r\n    interest. No other conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPurchase of an Unconditional Selection.\r\n\r\n        A deed of grant may be obtained at any time on payment of the\r\n    balance of the purchase price. Two and a-half per cent. per annum\r\n    is allowed if the amount is paid before due.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrickly Pear Selection.\r\n\r\n        Maximum area, 2,560 acres. This applies to land infested with\r\n    prickly-pear. Term, twenty-five years, with a peppercorn rental for\r\n    the first period, and an annual rent during the second period equal\r\n    to the amount of the purchasing price divided by the number of\r\n    years in the second period.\r\n\r\n\r\nConditions.\r\n\r\n        The land must be absolutely cleared of pear during the first\r\n    period as notified in the notification opening the land for\r\n    selection, and kept clear during the second period.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreehold of Prickly Pear Selections.\r\n\r\n        The freehold may be obtained at any time after the expiration\r\n    of two years from the beginning of the second period by the payment\r\n    of the balance of the purchase money, provided he has obtained a\r\n    certificate from the Commissioner that the conditions have been\r\n    fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrice of Prickly Pear Selections.\r\n\r\n        The price varies according to the state of infestation from nil\r\n    upwards, and in some cases where the land is badly infested a bonus\r\n    is given. The purchasing price or bonus is stated in the opening\r\n    notification.\r\n\r\n\r\nPastoral Holdings.\r\n\r\n        Pastoral holdings may be obtained on long leases, with\r\n    practically no restriction as to area. Terms up to thirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\nOccupation Licenses.\r\n\r\n        Large areas may be rented from the Government from year to year\r\n    under an occupation license. No limitation to area.\r\n\r\n\r\nGroup Settlement.\r\n\r\n        Under special conditions families from the same community are\r\n    allowed to settle in groups so as to permit of their retaining\r\n    their social relations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSize of Groups.\r\n\r\n        Groups of from six families to as many as seventy families have\r\n    already been successfully formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nInspection.\r\n\r\n        It is a good plan for friends to club together to pay the\r\n    expenses of one of their number to go to Queensland to find land\r\n    for a “group” to accommodate them all.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiners’ Homestead Leases.\r\n\r\n        Under the provisions of “_The Miners’ Homestead Leases Act of\r\n    1913_,” homestead leases can be acquired by application, or by\r\n    tender or public auction by residents of any mining field\r\n    throughout the State, in areas not exceeding 640 acres. During\r\n    the first period of thirty years the annual rental on areas up to\r\n    40 acres is 1s. per acre, and 6d. for any additional acreage in\r\n    excess of this area. This rental does not, of course, apply to\r\n    homesteads acquired by tender or sale. After the expiration of the\r\n    thirty years’ lease a nominal rental of 1s. only can be demanded.\r\n    The minimum annual rental for any homestead is 5s.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan an Alien select Land in Queensland?\r\n\r\n        Yes, provided he obtains a certificate to the effect that he\r\n    can read and write words in such language as the Minister for Lands\r\n    may direct; also provided that he becomes a naturalised British\r\n    subject within five years of his selecting the land, failing which\r\n    he will forfeit all his right, title, and interest in the land\r\n    selected.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is an Alien?\r\n\r\n        Any person who is not a British subject. For instance,\r\n    Americans, Frenchmen, Swedes, Italians, Russians, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen can an Alien become Naturalised?\r\n\r\n        After he has been at least two years in the Commonwealth of\r\n    Australia, he may take the oath of allegiance, become a Britisher,\r\n    and enjoy all the freedom and privileges appertaining thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere must Applications for Land be Lodged?\r\n\r\n        At the local Land Office.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow far from the Railway is the Available Land?\r\n\r\n        Most of the land is not far from existing lines. The policy of\r\n    the Government, however, is to build light railway lines (as\r\n    feeders to the main lines) to tap agricultural districts, and to\r\n    anticipate settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\nLight Railway Lines Opening Large Areas.\r\n\r\n        Some of these short lines which it is proposed to build will\r\n    open up an immense area of good land.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrown Lands at Auction.\r\n\r\n        Crown lands may be acquired in fee-simple by auction purchase\r\n    in limited areas as town and suburban lots.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrice.\r\n\r\n        The minimum purchasing price for land bought at auction is 10s.\r\n    per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\nTerms of Purchase.\r\n\r\n        Terms up to ten years may be allowed, with interest at 5 per\r\n    cent. per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Assistance does the Government Give the Intending Settler?\r\n\r\n        The Government issues a railway ticket at half the ordinary\r\n    fare to the intending settler desirous of inspecting Crown land\r\n    with a view of selecting an area not exceeding 5,120 acres. If the\r\n    intending settler subsequently takes up a selection, subject to\r\n    personal residence conditions, not exceeding 5,120 acres in area,\r\n    the half-fare paid by him is refunded, and his family, self,\r\n    ordinary household furniture and effects, agricultural implements,\r\n    seed, one dray, and one set of harness are carried free to the\r\n    railway station nearest to his selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Other Assistance?\r\n\r\n        Special reduced rates are granted for the carriage of building\r\n    material, fencing wire, and two truckloads of live stock. Wire\r\n    netting is also supplied on twenty years’ terms at 5 per cent. per\r\n    annum.\r\n\r\n\r\nAssistance to Obtain Water.\r\n\r\n        If desired, the State will also sink wells on waterless country,\r\n    spreading the cost over the total purchase price of the land over\r\n    the term of lease.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Agricultural Bank?\r\n\r\n        A Government Bank institution established, primarily, for the\r\n    purpose of assisting new settlers and also agriculturists and\r\n    graziers, to whom it makes advances on the security of freeholds,\r\n    licenses, and leases from the Crown, for the purpose of making\r\n    improvements on the land or for paying off liabilities, at 5 per\r\n    cent. per annum, repayable in twenty-five years or at any time at\r\n    the option of the borrower.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Security is Required?\r\n\r\n        The applicant for an advance must give a first mortgage on his\r\n    holding. The bank advances 12s. in the £1 on the total value of the\r\n    land and improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen is it Repayable?\r\n\r\n        For the first five years only simple interest is charged at 5\r\n    per cent. per annum. After five years the borrower must begin to\r\n    redeem his advance at the rate of £4 0s. 3d. half-yearly for each\r\n    £100 borrowed, inclusive of interest, until the whole has been\r\n    paid.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan the Settler Borrow Money to Buy Stock?\r\n\r\n        Yes. The Agricultural Bank will advance 12s. in the £1 of the\r\n    total value of the land and improvements for the purpose of\r\n    purchasing stock, machinery, or implements the selector desires to\r\n    purchase, or for relieving the liability on the holding. Advances\r\n    at the rate of 13s. 4d. in the £1 on the value of the land and\r\n    improvements thereon up to £200 can also be obtained for\r\n    unspecified purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan an Alien Obtain an Advance?\r\n\r\n        Yes, provided he obtains a certificate to the effect that he\r\n    can read and write words in such language as the Minister for Lands\r\n    may direct; also provided he becomes a naturalised British subject\r\n    within five years of his selecting the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkers’ Dwellings Act.\r\n\r\n        Under the provisions of this Act the Government make advances,\r\n    on easy terms of repayment, for the purpose of enabling persons of\r\n    small incomes to erect dwelling-houses as homes for themselves and\r\n    their families. The applicant must show that his income does not\r\n    exceed £200 per annum, and that he is not the owner of a\r\n    dwelling-house in Queensland or elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreeholds Farm.\r\n\r\n        Plenty of good freehold farms change hands from time to time in\r\n    Queensland at from £3 to £20 per acre. Settlers not desirous of\r\n    taking up Government land can easily be suited privately.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Nature of the Soil?\r\n\r\n        It varies with the locality. All of the Northern and Eastern\r\n    scrub lands are intensely fertile with vegetable mould. The Darling\r\n    Downs contains 4,000,000 acres of magnificent black soil,\r\n    principally decomposed basalt. The soil in the Maranoa district is\r\n    lighter and more suited to wheat-growing and vines. These\r\n    descriptions apply pretty generally to the whole of Queensland,\r\n    particularly the Central Districts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho are the most Successful Farmers?\r\n\r\n        Those who carry on mixed farming, such as dairying,\r\n    agriculture, sheep, pig and poultry raising, horticulture and\r\n    bee-farming, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo many of the Farmers Keep Sheep?\r\n\r\n        Yes; many of them now go in for lamb-raising on lucerne. There\r\n    are also a number of selectors who have sheep on areas of from 640\r\n    to 4,000 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs Dairying Increasing in Queensland?\r\n\r\n        Yes, every day; and nearly all the dairy farmers are\r\n    independent men.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much Milk was Obtained in 1913?\r\n\r\n        90,545,516 gallons. Quantity utilised for making butter,\r\n    73,582,041 gallons; for cheese, 5,268,447 gallons; for condensed\r\n    milk, 2,131,382 gallons; sold for domestic purposes, 4,178,758\r\n    gallons; and 5,384,888 gallons used on farms.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow did these Dairymen Begin?\r\n\r\n        Most of them began in a very small way, buying a cow now and\r\n    again as they could afford it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere they all Small Farmers?\r\n\r\n        Yes, for the most part. The larger farmers have also taken up\r\n    dairying in addition to wheat, maize, barley, lucerne, and oat\r\n    growing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the Butter Production in Queensland in 1913?\r\n\r\n        35,199,387 lb., valued at £1,613,305.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheese, 1913?\r\n\r\n        5,395,050 lb., valued at £141,400.\r\n\r\n\r\nCondensed Milk made in 1913?\r\n\r\n        8,059,051 lb., valued at £187,536.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat will a Good Average Cow Earn?\r\n\r\n        From 15s. to 30s. per month.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Price of a Good Cow?\r\n\r\n        From £5 to £8. Of course some well-bred cows fetch a much\r\n    higher figure.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Class of Dairy Herd in Queensland?\r\n\r\n        Dairy stock have been imported to Queensland from the principal\r\n    herds of the world, and a splendid class of cow is now in use,\r\n    comprising the following breeds:—Milking Shorthorn, Ayrshire,\r\n    Holstein, Guernsey, and Jersey.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many Cows does the Average Farm Carry?\r\n\r\n        It all depends on the size of the holding. There are many large\r\n    properties in Queensland milking several hundred cows daily\r\n    throughout the year. The average herd is about 20, but many farmers\r\n    milk from 80 to 150 daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many Cows could you Carry on 160 Acres?\r\n\r\n        With good land, mixed farming, and by growing crops and\r\n    conserving fodder, you could carry 30 to 40 at a low estimate. Some\r\n    160 acres cleared scrub farms carry 70 to 80 cows.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonthly Cheques.\r\n\r\n        Suppliers to the factories are paid monthly by cheque, and some\r\n    draw £100 and over per month for milk and cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nPigs.\r\n\r\n        Pig-raising is now considered to be a part of dairying, and is\r\n    very profitable. The climate is particularly suited to pigs, and no\r\n    housing is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nPig Farms.\r\n\r\n        On some holdings large mobs of young pigs are grazed on barley\r\n    or alfalfa (lucerne), and topped up in batches in large sties.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarket for Pigs.\r\n\r\n        There is a certain market for pigs in Brisbane, Toowoomba, &c.,\r\n    where there are bacon-curing establishments.\r\n\r\n\r\nWheat.\r\n\r\n        Wheat is sown (late maturing varieties) in March and April, and\r\n    (quick maturing varieties) in May, June, and July. Harvesting\r\n    extends from October to early in December.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Wheat is Principally Grown.\r\n\r\n        In Southern Queensland. It can also be grown in the\r\n    Central-western districts of Queensland.\r\n\r\n\r\nWheat Yield.\r\n\r\n        Crops of 20 to 30 bushels to the acre are commonly reaped in\r\n    the best wheat-growing districts of Queensland. Forty bushels per\r\n    acre have often been obtained in individual instances.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaize.\r\n\r\n        Maize is planted in July and August right up to January, and is\r\n    fit for harvesting in 120 days. It can be grown all over\r\n    Queensland, where the rainfall is sufficient. Two crops a year are\r\n    possible in sub-tropical scrub and coastal country.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaize Yield.\r\n\r\n        Immense yields of maize, from 40 to 80 bushels per acre, are\r\n    frequently obtained on the rich scrub lands. Yields of 120 bushels\r\n    per acre have also been obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarley.\r\n\r\n        Barley does particularly well on the Darling Downs, where the\r\n    quality of the crop for malting purposes is held by English experts\r\n    to equal the best Hungarian. Crops of from 30 to 40 bushels are\r\n    frequent in a good season.\r\n\r\n\r\nSugarcane.\r\n\r\n        Sugarcane growing is carried on along the coastal area from\r\n    Brisbane northwards. It is planted from January to June; 2,085,588\r\n    tons of sugarcane were produced in 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrice Paid for Cane.\r\n\r\n        Prices for cane vary according to its sugar-producing\r\n    properties and the locality in which it is grown. These, however,\r\n    range from 20s. to 27s. per ton. Crops of from 40 to even 70 tons\r\n    per acre have been obtained in the North.\r\n\r\n\r\nHay.\r\n\r\n        Hay averaged about 1-3/4 tons to the acre for the last twenty\r\n    years. Individual crops yield much heavier results.\r\n\r\n\r\nPotatoes.\r\n\r\n        Both English and sweet potatoes give heavy yields.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few of Queensland’s Products for 1913.\r\n\r\n    Wool (in grease)              154,183,114 lb.\r\n    Frozen and preserved meats    265,481,423 〃\r\n    Meat Extract                      520,748 〃\r\n    Butter                         35,199,387 〃\r\n    Cheese                          5,395,050 〃\r\n    Bacon and Hams                 13,709,716 〃\r\n    Maize                           3,915,376 bush.\r\n    Wheat                           1,769,432 〃\r\n    Barley                            115,975 〃\r\n    Sugarcane                       2,085,588 tons.\r\n    Sugar manufactured                242,837 〃\r\n    English potatoes                   16,548 〃\r\n    Sweet potatoes                     14,425 〃\r\n    Hay                               103,935 〃\r\n    Oranges                           375,544 bush.\r\n    Grapes                          4,092,531 lb.\r\n    Wine                               58,897 gals.\r\n    Bananas                         1,037,936 bunches.\r\n    Pineapples                        744,906 doz.\r\n    Mangoes                           156,349 bush.\r\n    Strawberries                      152,608 quarts\r\n    Apples                             49,423 bush.\r\n    Papaws                             32,287 doz.\r\n    Peaches                            53,579 bush.\r\n\r\n\r\nLucerne or Alfalfa.\r\n\r\n        This is one of the best crops a farmer can grow in Southern\r\n    Queensland. Once planted, it lasts from seven to ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\nLucerne Crops.\r\n\r\n        The roots of lucerne have been known to penetrate the soil for\r\n    a depth of 30 ft. In a good year five to six cuttings can be\r\n    obtained. Ten cuttings per annum are often obtained around Laidley,\r\n    Southern Queensland.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan a Man get any Crop with his First Ploughing?\r\n\r\n        Yes. Wheat or Maize.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat First Crop can be got off Scrub Land?\r\n\r\n        The method is to fell the scrub, and, after it has dried, put a\r\n    fire through it. Maize is then put in with a hoe between the\r\n    stumps. Some crops up to 85 bushels per acre have been garnered in\r\n    this way.\r\n\r\n\r\nState Agricultural College.\r\n\r\n        There is a State Agricultural College at Gatton, South\r\n    Queensland, where students can undergo a three years’ training at a\r\n    cost of under £30 per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre there any other State Experimental Farms?\r\n\r\n        Yes. At Hermitage, near Warwick; Roma, South-western\r\n    Queensland; Warren, near Rockhampton; Gindie, near Emerald; Kairi,\r\n    Atherton district (North Queensland); and at Kamerunga, near Cairns\r\n    (North Queensland); Sugar Experiment Station and Laboratory, Mackay\r\n    (North Queensland); and experimental plots in all the principal\r\n    sugar districts.\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse and Buildings.\r\n\r\n        At first a farmer generally erects a rough, cheap building of\r\n    materials cut on the place at a cost of a few pounds, and when\r\n    matters improve puts up a more suitable dwelling.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere can Building Materials be Obtained?\r\n\r\n        Iron and wood can be obtained in any part of Queensland.\r\n    Competition among the timber merchants is so keen that timber can\r\n    be procured at a small cost. A small comfortable cottage can be\r\n    built for about £100 upwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Droughts Often Occur?\r\n\r\n        The last drought was in 1902, and even then there were parts of\r\n    Queensland not affected by it. Droughts do not, as a rule, affect\r\n    the whole country, and with extended railway communication relief\r\n    country will be available.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecuperative Power of the Land.\r\n\r\n        The recuperative power of the land is marvellous. A fortnight\r\n    after summer rain (following a dry spell) the country is waving\r\n    with grasses. Owing to the mild climate, the growth is phenomenal.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal Markets.\r\n\r\n        Farmers can readily dispose of all they can grow in the local\r\n    markets, where competition amongst buyers is keen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouthern Markets.\r\n\r\n        There is a certain market in the South for all Queensland\r\n    produce.\r\n\r\n\r\nOversea Markets.\r\n\r\n        A certain market for wool, hides, butter, cheese, frozen meat,\r\n    and other products exists in Great Britain and Europe. Trade with\r\n    the United States and Canada is developing. There are splendid\r\n    openings for trade with Java, China, Japan, and the East generally.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Nature of the Trade with Asia?\r\n\r\n        Cattle, horses, bones, hoofs, leather, butter, cheese, fodder,\r\n    fruits, glue pieces and sinews, barley, oats, wheat, bran, pollard,\r\n    flour, hay, chaff, honey, refined animal fats, manures, bacon and\r\n    hams, beef, mutton, pork, other meat, milk concentrated and\r\n    preserved, potatoes, skins and hides, tallow, wool.\r\n\r\n\r\nHorses.\r\n\r\n        There were 707,265 horses in Queensland in 1913. A large\r\n    remount trade is now done with India, Java, and the East.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Parts of Queensland are the Best for Cattle?\r\n\r\n        Cattle do well all over Queensland, and especially on the\r\n    Eastern coast lands and the North.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Number of Cattle are there in Queensland?\r\n\r\n        5,322,033 for 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere do Sheep Thrive Best?\r\n\r\n        On the great central plains of Western Queensland, and in the\r\n    country west of the Dividing Range.\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber of Sheep in Queensland.\r\n\r\n        21,786,600 for 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncrease of Sheep for Ten Years.\r\n\r\n        13,394,556.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the Value of the Wool in 1913?\r\n\r\n        £6,296,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the Value of the Imports and Exports in 1913?\r\n\r\n        Imports (oversea only), £6,714,942; Exports (oversea only),\r\n    £12,352,748; total, £19,067,690. The above figures do not, of\r\n    course, include interstate transactions. It is reasonable to assume\r\n    that the total value of the imports and exports would be, at least,\r\n    doubled.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn what Area could a Man Profitably Grow Wool?\r\n\r\n        On a grazing farm of 20,000 acres, with a capital of £4,000, he\r\n    could make a net income of £600 to £1,000 a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre there Larger Areas than this?\r\n\r\n        Some of the stations carry from 100,000 to 200,000 sheep, and\r\n    are over 1,000 square miles in area. One is 5,000 square miles in\r\n    area.\r\n\r\n\r\nMining Employees.\r\n\r\n        There are 12,393 men employed in and around mines in\r\n    Queensland.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Ordinary Rate for Unskilled Labour in Mines?\r\n\r\n        From 8s. 3d. to 13s. per shift of eight hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt what Age should a Miner Come to Queensland?\r\n\r\n        Between 20 and 40 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat could a Practical Miner do in Queensland?\r\n\r\n        He could get work in a mine or prospect the country in search\r\n    of minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the Aggregate Area of the Mining Fields Proclaimed Open?\r\n\r\n        78,073 square miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the Total Output of Gold from Queensland Mines to the end of\r\n            1913?\r\n\r\n        17,973,674 fine oz.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the Total Value of this Output?\r\n\r\n        £76,347,265.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the Total Value of Minerals other than Gold won from\r\n            Queensland Mines to the end of 1913?\r\n\r\n        £31,419,755. Grand total, all minerals, £107,767,020.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiner’s Right.\r\n\r\n        On payment of 5s. a year any man can obtain a miner’s right\r\n    authorising him to mine for minerals on any Crown lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nRewards for Discovery of New Goldfields.\r\n\r\n        On certain conditions, rewards, not exceeding £500 in one\r\n    instance, and not exceeding £1,000 in another, are given by the\r\n    Government for the discovery of new goldfields.\r\n\r\n\r\nProspecting.\r\n\r\n        Prospectors for tin in the North—chiefly about Herberton—do\r\n    fairly well.\r\n\r\n\r\nClaims.\r\n\r\n        The holder of a miner’s right may by himself or his agent take\r\n    up and hold any number of claims or shares in such claims, provided\r\n    that such claims or shares are duly worked and represented by the\r\n    prescribed number of men.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeasons.\r\n\r\n        The spring commences in September, and the summer ends in\r\n    February. The winter climate is perfect.\r\n\r\n\r\nReligious Freedom.\r\n\r\n        There is no State church in Queensland. All religious\r\n    denominations are on an equality, and complete religious liberty\r\n    prevails.\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\n        Education is free and compulsory.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpenditure on Education.\r\n\r\n        £657,613 were spent by the State on education in 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\nState Schools.\r\n\r\n        There are 1,338 State Schools in Queensland, with a total\r\n    enrolment of 119,006 scholars, and 3,269 teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal Schools, including State Schools, 1913.\r\n\r\n        1,518 schools, with an average daily attendance of 97,852\r\n    scholars.\r\n\r\n\r\nCountry Schools.\r\n\r\n        There are excellent State schools situated throughout the\r\n    country districts of Queensland.\r\n\r\n\r\nProvisional Schools.\r\n\r\n        Provisional schools are established wherever necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nHigher Educational Institutions.\r\n\r\n        Six High Schools (free), 16 Technical Colleges, 10 Grammar\r\n    Schools (boys and girls), a School of Mines at Charters Towers\r\n    (North Queensland), and a University.\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation in Sparsely-populated Districts.\r\n\r\n        Travelling Government teachers periodically visit the more\r\n    sparsely settled districts to arrange for the education of the\r\n    children so circumstanced. Half-time Schools are also established\r\n    on many sheep and cattle stations.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdult Vote.\r\n\r\n        Every man and woman in Queensland over the age of twenty-one\r\n    years is entitled to a vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Law-abiding Community.\r\n\r\n        Queensland is one of the most law-abiding countries in the\r\n    world.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrderliness of Crowds.\r\n\r\n        The orderliness of large crowds is a remarkable feature of\r\n    Australian life, and one which generally causes surprise on the\r\n    part of the visitor. This orderliness is characteristic of\r\n    Queenslanders.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Notable Fact.\r\n\r\n        The morning after the assemblage of a crowd of nearly 60,000\r\n    people on the opening day of the Brisbane Show in 1914 showed a\r\n    complete absence of wrongdoing on the police charge-sheet.\r\n\r\n\r\nElection Crowds.\r\n\r\n        There is no rowdy conduct during elections in Queensland. Women\r\n    visit the polls and record their votes as easily as attending\r\n    church.\r\n\r\n\r\nQueensland Railways.\r\n\r\n        The Queensland Railways are the property of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many Miles of State Railway are Open?\r\n\r\n        4,856 miles to 31st December, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\nRailway Receipts and Expenditure, 1913.\r\n\r\n        Receipts         £3,660,022\r\n        Expenditure      £2,371,261\r\n                        ———————————\r\n         Net profit      £1,288,761\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivate Railways, to 31st December, 1914.\r\n\r\n        Only 330 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the Value of the Gold produced in Queensland for 1913?\r\n\r\n        £1,128,768 for 265,735 fine oz.\r\n\r\nOther Minerals.\r\n\r\n        Silver, 604,979 oz.

The value of the plant and machinery was £5,877,387,\r\n    and the value of the land and premises £3,923,584. Value of output,\r\n    £23,688,789.\r\n\r\n\r\nHospitals.\r\n\r\n        There are eighty-five public hospitals in Queensland, besides\r\n    numerous private ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nShipping of the State, 1913.\r\n\r\n        2,247,434 tons entered.\r\n        2,251,503 tons cleared.\r\n\r\n\r\nTimber Sawn for 1913.\r\n\r\n        Softwoods, 98,620,299 superficial feet, valued at the mill,\r\n    £778,084; cedar, 882,092 superficial feet, valued at the mill,\r\n    £15,964; hardwoods, 57,131,224 superficial feet, valued at the\r\n    mill, £510,967; mouldings, &c., £61,872; 1,101,271 sleepers,\r\n    £92,906.

The cases cited here will serve to illustrate\r\nwhat the men on the land in the districts visited are doing to\r\ndevelop the agricultural resources of the country. Despite that the\r\nnew settlers were faced with many difficulties at the outset, they,\r\nby indomitable pluck, determination, and perseverance, succeeded in\r\nconquering the dense scrubs and mountain fastnesses, and converting\r\nthem into wealth-producing agricultural homesteads. Many of these\r\nsettlers started with only a few pounds in their pocket, but they had\r\nwhat money cannot buy—stout hearts, courage, and energy. To-day quite\r\na number of these have turned the corner of adversity into the highway\r\nof success, and are reaping the fruits of their labours.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      A Successful Mixed Farmer.\r\n\r\nIn the Springsure district (Central Queensland) Mr. M. T. Bourke is\r\none of the most successful dairymen and mixed farmers. His dairy herd\r\nconsists of pure-bred Shorthorns and pedigreed bulls. On an average he\r\nmilks 88 cows once daily during the year, and these are fed on natural\r\npastures. Last year he obtained 19,094 gallons of milk, and 9,339 lb.\r\nof cream produced 2,649 lb. of commercial butter. In April, 1913,\r\n1,039 lb. of cream sent to one of the Rockhampton factories returned\r\nover 576 lb. of commercial butter. His year’s transactions in pigs\r\nrealised £91 12s.; turkeys, £27 3s.; fowls, £2 10s. 8d.; eggs (317\r\ndozen), £16; fat bullocks, 400 at £7 per head; horses (artillery and\r\ndraught), £626 10s. Several of the horses brought from £26 to £28 per\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  What the Daniels Family are Doing.\r\n\r\nThe Daniels family, which numbers no less than eight distinct\r\nbranches, are also very successful mixed farmers in the Gindie\r\ndistrict (Central Queensland). Their operations comprise\r\nwheat-growing, dairying, sheep-breeding, &c. In 1913 they had about\r\n250 acres under wheat.\r\n\r\nMr. T. C. Daniels gives the following particulars in regard to the\r\ncultivation and harvesting of wheat:—“The first ploughing,” he says,\r\n“will cost 15s. per acre, but afterwards it will only be 5s. for the\r\nsame area. Other expenditure includes: Seed wheat, about 8s. per acre;\r\ncultivating after first ploughing, 2s. 6d. per acre; harvesting with\r\nreaper and binder, 5s. per acre; carting and stooking, 5s. per acre;\r\ntotal expenditure, £1 5s. 6d. per acre. The cost of cutting a ton of\r\nchaff is about £1 5s., and bags are 8d. each. His crop averaged 30\r\ncwt. to the acre, and he received £6 10s. per ton for his wheaten\r\nchaff on the rails at Gindie Station.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Started with £100.\r\n\r\nIn the course of an interview, Mr. J. Edminstone, of Craigend Farm,\r\nBelmont Pocket, near Rockhampton (Central Queensland), gave some\r\ninformation which should be invaluable to intending settlers in\r\nQueensland. Mr. Edminstone is, at the present time, one of the most\r\nprosperous dairymen in the State.\r\n\r\n“A labouring man,” Mr. Edminstone said, “could easily earn about\r\n£200 a year at farming in Queensland. I have made that myself. I had\r\nexperience on a farm in the old country, but that is not absolutely\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n“I consider farming is the best thing for new settlers to turn their\r\nattention to in Queensland.\r\n\r\n“I would recommend a man to take up dairy farming. Cows can be bought\r\nfor about £4 to £7 each. Then you can buy good dairy land for about\r\n£1 per acre. You have long terms, about twenty years, to pay for\r\nyour land, and the payments are not equal to a good rent in the old\r\ncountry. When a man has got his land he can grow plenty of feed for\r\nhis cattle for the few months of the winter, when they have to be fed\r\non account of the pastures being dry. During the rest of the year his\r\ncattle find their food in the natural grasses of his pastures.\r\n\r\n“A man could easily make a good start here with about £150. That money\r\nwould be used for paying the first instalment on his land purchase,\r\nbuying a few cows, and putting up his house. Of course, a pioneer\r\ndoesn’t spend much on his house at first, until he has made some money.\r\n\r\n“I began with £100 about fifteen years ago. I have paid for my land\r\nsome time since, and I reckon that at the present time I am worth\r\nabout £2,000 in land and stock.”\r\n\r\nMr. Edminstone milks, as a rule, 90 cows during the year, and each of\r\nthese earn, on an average, 20s. per month. The highest return from one\r\ncow was 27s. per month. The cows are fed on the natural grasses only.\r\nIn January last 105 grade Ayrshires, Shorthorns, and Jerseys earned\r\n£121; February—115 cows, £111; March—105 cows, £101; April—100\r\ncows, £104; May—90 cows, £66; June—75 cows, £55; July—60 cows, £58.\r\nMr. Edminstone has, according to his books, been receiving similar\r\nsatisfactory returns from his milking herd for many years past. Pig\r\nraising and general farming also claims a great deal of his attention,\r\nand the annual returns from these sources are highly satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      New Settlers’ Experiences.\r\n\r\nMr. C. W. L. Bryde, who has taken up a selection in the parish of\r\nDambulla, near Lake Barrine, Atherton, North Queensland, about\r\ntwo years ago, is satisfied that his new home has been pitched in\r\n“the garden of Australia.” He was born in Liverpool, England, and,\r\nadopting the sea as a profession, reached the position of chief mate.\r\nSeveral severe trips between Newcastle and Valparaiso with coal for\r\nthe Chilian Government cooled off his ardour for the sea, and, faced\r\nwith nervous breakdown, he was attracted to North Queensland. He took\r\nup his selection, and threw himself with enthusiasm into his new\r\nemployment. Mr. Bryde says that the soil is extraordinarily rich, and\r\nit is quite clear that the district has a great future. Permanent\r\ncreeks abound everywhere, and on his holding there are seven streams\r\ncarrying crystal water. Chokos, pumpkins, and piemelons, the seeds\r\nof which were dropped, grew wild, and the scrubs contain scores of\r\npassion-fruit vines. At present the timber does not pay to market,\r\nthough it is only eight miles from Kulara, on the Tolga-Johnstone\r\nline; but if the railway from this point to Mobo, via Lake Barrine,\r\nwere constructed, cedar patches and other timbers, such as red and\r\nwhite beech, kauri, and silky oak, would be made available. Mr. Bryde\r\nhas seen the Richmond River, and he considers that the land in his\r\nneighbourhood is superior. But he states that it is of no use for any\r\none to go in for land there unless he is willing to rough it.\r\n\r\nA Victorian (Mr. Herbert C. West), who settled at Eurobin Park,\r\nJandowae, in the Dalby district (Southern Queensland), about two years\r\nago, is also satisfied with his experiences in Queensland. Writing\r\nto the Department of Lands, he said:—“We have just had a delightful\r\nrainfall, and my lucerne, maize, and other green crops are looking\r\nwell. This is a splendid district, and I am more than satisfied with\r\nmy adopted country.”\r\n\r\n\r\n   Had a Stout Heart, Strong Pair of Hands, and Plenty of Pluck and\r\n                            Determination.\r\n\r\nMr. J. McLellan, of Miriam Vale, in the Gladstone district (Central\r\nQueensland), stated that he started as an agriculturist sixteen years\r\nago with a stout heart, a strong pair of hands, plenty of pluck and\r\ndetermination, and 6s. per day while he was working on the railway\r\nline. His frugality enabled him to save money out of his wages to buy\r\na couple of head of cattle at a time. In his spare moments he cleared\r\nhis land, and got it ready for its first crop. After a little time\r\nhe devoted the whole of his exertions to his farm, with the result\r\nthat he soon became independent of outside employment. That he has\r\nbecome a successful man is abundantly proved by the fact that he is\r\nnow enjoying a trip to Scotland. As a dairyman and general farmer, Mr.\r\nMcLellan can hold his own with any one in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Successful Efforts from Small Beginnings.\r\n\r\nIn the Barmoya Scrub, Rockhampton district (Central Queensland), a\r\ngood percentage of the recent settlers had very small beginnings, but\r\nnow they are fairly well off. Mr. J. Kersey (a carpenter) had a horse\r\nand cart and £7; Mr. A. T. Vaisey (formerly an employee in a New\r\nZealand flax mill) had £75; Mr. F. W. A. Broszat (a bricklayer), £250;\r\nMr. Reuben Johnson (a shift boss on Mount Morgan Mine), £100. All are\r\nwell satisfied with their lot. The German settlers, of whom there are\r\na large number, frankly admit that they are contented, and say that\r\none and all have splendid opportunities to become prosperous, but they\r\nmust be prepared to work hard to attain this object.\r\n\r\nMr. R. Johnson is one of the most prosperous settlers in this\r\ndistrict. He was one of the first to settle in the district about\r\nten years ago, and he has had no reason to regret it. He milks on\r\nan average 42 cows of the grade Jersey strain daily, and each beast\r\nreturns him about 15s. per month regularly. The herd includes a\r\npure-bred Jersey bull and cow. There are 130 acres under Rhodes grass\r\nand 7 acres under maize and pumpkins. Mr. Johnson has done wonders\r\nin the short time that he has been in the district, and his efforts\r\nshould prove a strong incentive to others to do likewise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Started as a Farm Labourer.\r\n\r\nIn the Bushley district, near Rockhampton (Central Queensland), Mr.\r\nE. Holland has a splendid farm of about 3,000 acres on Sandy Creek.\r\nHe states that he started farming with little or no money. Soon after\r\nhis arrival from England he found employment as a farm labourer, and\r\naccepted cattle as payment for his work. A year or so later he took\r\nup a 160-acre block at a rental of 2s. 6d. per acre, and then started\r\ndairying. As years went by he acquired further areas, and increased\r\nhis operations to such an extent that he is now one of the most\r\nsuccessful settlers in Central Queensland. His dairy herd is made\r\nup of grade Shorthorns and a pedigreed Shorthorn bull, and totals\r\n500. On an average 80 cows are milked once a day during the year.\r\nThe young steers are fattened up and sold to the butchers when about\r\ntwelve months old. Last year (1913) he sold thirty-six of these at £3\r\n10s. per head. Horses (light draughts and saddle) are also bred. He\r\nalso finds time for raising Berkshire and Yorkshire pigs. There are\r\n35 acres under cultivation—4 acres lucerne and 31 acres rotation\r\ncrops—wheat, oats, rye, panicum, &c. Mr. Holland is also a maker\r\nof Cheshire cheese of splendid flavour, but his operations in this\r\nrespect are only on a small scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Had a Horse and Saddle and 3s. 6d.\r\n\r\nMr. J. T. Alexander, of Glenlyon Farm, Dalma, near Rockhampton\r\n(Central Queensland), arrived in Queensland from New South Wales in\r\n1887, with a horse and saddle and 3s. 6d. in his pocket. At first\r\nhe engaged in droving, then was a stockman on a station, and later\r\nmanager of several cattle runs. Seven years ago he purchased 3,000\r\nacres of the Glenlyon Estate, which consisted of open forest country.\r\nThen he turned his attention to the breeding of dairy and beef cattle\r\nand Border-Leicester sheep. He is getting £5 per head for 2-year-old\r\nsteers, £3 for 12-month-old steers, and £4 15s. for 3-year-old\r\nheifers. The area under cultivation totals 14 acres—barley 4 acres,\r\nlucerne 2 acres, maize 2 acres, panicum 4 acres, sweet potatoes 2\r\nacres. He has 150 head of beef cattle, and a small dairy herd of grade\r\nJerseys.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Fruit-grower Starts with £5.\r\n\r\nAfter paying for his freehold of 21 acres, Mr. A. Neale, of Parkhurst,\r\nNorth Rockhampton (Central Queensland), had only about £5 in cash,\r\nthree horses, and a few agricultural implements. By dint of hard work\r\nhe cleared his land of the forest, planted it with fruit trees, and in\r\na couple of years he gathered his first crops. Later he erected his\r\npresent home. To-day he is in a comfortable position, due entirely\r\nto fruit-growing. In all 5 acres are under fruits of different\r\nkinds. Citrus fruits, which number 300 trees, are most generally\r\ngrown. Grapes, peaches, papaws, loquats, plums, and mangoes are also\r\ncultivated. In 1913 citrus fruits returned £250, grapes £130, and\r\nother crops, £30. He milks a few cows of the Shorthorn-Hereford cross\r\nfor his own wants, and pigs are bred for a like purpose. Poultry and\r\nvegetables are annually raised for market. Mr. Neale is a strong\r\nadvocate of dry farming.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Had only a Few Shillings left after Paying the First Year’s\r\n                              Rent.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of the new settlers in the Woodend and Bushley Scrubs,\r\nin the Rockhampton district (Central Queensland), started in a small\r\nway, and are now in very comfortable circumstances. The Lehfeldt\r\nBrothers were formerly employed as labourers at the Mount Morgan\r\nMine. In 1895 they selected 160 acres, and after paying the first\r\nyear’s rent (£5 15s.) had only a few shillings left. When they had\r\nfinished fencing the land and clearing portion of it, they arranged to\r\nsupply the Mount Morgan Mine with firewood. By this means they made\r\nsufficient money to acquire a further 160 acres for £100 cash, and\r\neffect more substantial improvements on their holdings. Farming was\r\nbegun in real earnest in 1906, and since then success has attended\r\ntheir efforts. Last year the Messrs. Lehfeldt took up another block\r\nof 160 acres at a rental of 20s. per acre. They have 328 acres under\r\ncultivation—20 acres lucerne, 90 acres maize, 170 acres Rhodes grass,\r\n40 acres paspalum, 5 acres panicum, 3 acres English potatoes. Last\r\nyear (1913) they averaged 110 bushels of maize to the acre from a\r\n10-acre plot, and annexed the championship for Central Queensland.\r\nPatches of sugarcane and cotton are also grown. The dairy herd\r\ncomprises 20 grade Ayrshires and a pure-bred Ayrshire bull. It is\r\ntheir intention to increase their operations in dairying at an early\r\ndate. Pigs are being profitably raised, likewise light draught and\r\nsaddle horses. The Messrs. Lehfeldt have one of the best conducted\r\nfarms in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Mining Engineer—Now a Successful Fruit-grower, &c.\r\n\r\nMr. J. T. Coates, of Harveston, Rockhampton (Central Queensland), was\r\nformerly a mining engineer before he took up 327 acres on the bank of\r\nthe Fitzroy River. He has 10 acres under fruits—1,100 papaws, 150\r\ncitrus (including oranges, limes, lemons, cumquots), 500 grape vines,\r\n50 custard apples, 20 mangoes, also figs, bananas, apples, pears,\r\npeaches, quinces, persimmons, pineapples, granadillas, &c. There are\r\nalso 30 acres under lucerne, 11 acres of Japanese millet, and 5 acres\r\nof sweet potatoes. White Leghorns and Black Orpingtons of pure strains\r\nare largely raised, the former by the thousands. Mr. Coates also pays\r\nmuch attention to dairying, and his herd of grade Shorthorns give good\r\nreturns monthly. Although his fruit trees only started to bear last\r\nyear his returns in this direction amounted to £150. From poultry and\r\neggs he received £150, dairying £101, chaff £180, and miscellaneous\r\n£35. The total receipts from all sources were £616. Last year Mr.\r\nCoates paid away over £400 in wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Inexperience no Obstacle to Success.\r\n\r\nAmong the new settlers in the Stanwell district (Central Queensland)\r\nare quite a number who started with limited capital, and no previous\r\nexperience in farming. Mr. T. P. Connor was a miner, and had £500. Not\r\nonly is he dairying, growing crops, and raising pigs, but he is also\r\nbreeding beef cattle and horses with much success. Messrs. J. Thomas\r\n(stockman) and J. Todman (miner) started with £250, and are now doing\r\nwell out of general farming, dairying, pig-raising, &c. Portion of\r\nthe farm is irrigated, the water being lifted by a pump from Neerkol\r\nCreek, and conveyed in galvanised iron piping to the cultivation\r\nareas. They estimate the cost to irrigate an acre at 8s., exclusive of\r\ntheir own labour. Mr. W. H. Teakel (a Victorian farmer) started with\r\n£400, and says that he is doing better than he did in Victoria. Every\r\nyear he is getting good crops of maize, lucerne, wheat, pumpkins,\r\npotatoes, &c. He has a small herd of grade Ayrshires, and a few pigs.\r\n\r\nThe Plunkett family have been farming for three years, and are\r\ngetting splendid returns from their farming operations. They have a\r\nfairly large area under maize, lucerne, potatoes, &c., milk 15 grade\r\nAyrshires daily, and breed horses and pigs for market. Mr. Plunkett\r\npaid £1,400 for the farm of 411 acres as a going concern for his sons.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Had no Previous Agricultural Experience.\r\n\r\nMr. W. J. Barber selected 640 acres of dense vine scrub and brigalow\r\ncountry a few miles from Banana (Central Queensland) in 1913 at 10s.\r\nper acre. He came from Young (New South Wales), with £190, and had no\r\nprevious experience of agricultural life. About 46 acres of the scrub\r\nhave been cleared and planted with Rhodes grass and maize, the latter\r\nbeing sown with the aid of a hand planter. From 30 to 40 acres more\r\nscrub are being cleared, and will be put under cultivation when it is\r\nready. The first year’s outlay on the farm amounted to about £190.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Made a Start with £150.\r\n\r\nMr. Peter Jensen started in the Banana district (Central Queensland)\r\nwith £150 by taking up 880 acres, a little over a year ago, at 10s.\r\nper acre. The country comprises brigalow scrub and open downs. He has\r\ncleared 50 acres, and put in Rhodes grass and maize. A further 50\r\nacres is to be cleared, and planted with Rhodes grass and maize. Mr.\r\nJensen’s first crop of maize of 34 acres yielded 900 bushels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     On the High Road to Success.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Roderick is one of the pioneers of the agricultural\r\nindustry in the Banana district, Central Queensland. He has 1,280\r\nacres of land, for which he paid 10s. per acre. In addition to raising\r\ncrops, Mr. Roderick is engaging in dairying and pig raising. Last\r\nyear he obtained 840 bushels of maize from 33 acres. This year he has\r\n27 acres under maize, and 33 acres of Rhodes grass. Mr. Roderick was\r\npreviously a publican.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Landed in the District with £200.\r\n\r\nMr. C. G. Young selected 136 acres at Deeford, in the Dawson Valley\r\ncountry, Central Queensland, in 1912. Previously he was a commercial\r\ntraveller in Sydney. When he landed in the district he had £200. After\r\nclearing the dense vine scrub from his farm, he planted 24 acres with\r\nmaize, Rhodes grass, and pumpkins. The price paid for the Crown land\r\nwas 50s. per acre. Mr. Young estimates his first year’s expenditure\r\nat slightly over £100. Dairying and pig-raising on a small scale is\r\ncarried on. This young farmer stated he was well satisfied with his\r\nprospects.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Tasmanian takes up a Farm with £600.\r\n\r\nMr. E. Stevens, of Deeford, in the Dawson Valley (Central Queensland),\r\ncame from Tasmania nearly two years ago, with £600. His farm consists\r\nof 174 acres, of which 65 acres have been cleared of the dense scrub,\r\nand planted with maize and Rhodes grass. He intends to give dairying\r\nsome of his attention at an early date. The first year’s operations\r\ninvolved an expenditure of about £185.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Miner Starts Farming with £50.\r\n\r\nMr. C. F. Holton, who was a miner by occupation, took up 160 acres at\r\nGrantleigh, in the Gogango district (Central Queensland), seven years\r\nago. At the time he had only £50 in his pocket. For a couple of years\r\nhe undertook to cut timber for the Mount Morgan Mine, and also worked\r\non the selections of several of his neighbours. By this means he made\r\nsufficient money to enable him to start farming on his own account.\r\nTo-day he is making a profit of over £100 annually by growing lucerne,\r\nmaize, potatoes, &c. Last year he obtained from 65 to 70 bushels to\r\nthe acre from his crop of maize, and his lucerne yields from five\r\nto six cuttings annually. Berkshire and Yorkshire pigs are bred on\r\na small scale. Among other crops grown are Rhodes grass, millets,\r\nbarley, cowpea, pumpkins, and grapes. In partnership with Mr. H.\r\nGates, he has acquired a prickly-pear selection of 640 acres on the\r\nopposite side of the line. The pear, which is very thick, is being\r\neradicated by burning. It takes two men a day to clear two acres.\r\nAbout 150 acres of this property is to be planted with wheat, oats,\r\nEnglish potatoes, and fruits\r\nof various kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Queensland—The Finest Agricultural Country in Australia.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Laver, a Victorian farmer, together with his nine sons,\r\ntook up 13,000 acres under the group system in the Gogango Scrub\r\n(Central Queensland) five years ago. They have now 3,000 acres\r\ncleared, and 500 acres under cultivation, 400 acres being under Rhodes\r\ngrass. The other crops are:—Maize, 30 acres; lucerne, 50 acres;\r\ncowpea, 5 acres; pumpkins (planted in the same area with the maize),\r\n30 acres. Citrus fruits and grapes are also grown on a small scale.\r\nLast year 10 acres of oats and 9 acres of wheat averaged 2 tons of\r\nhay to the acre. Herefords, crossed by a Devon-Shorthorn strain of\r\nbull, are bred for the butcher every year. The dairy herd is composed\r\nof grade Shorthorns and Ayrshires, crossed by an Illawarra bull. The\r\nreturn from 20 to 40 cows for the year was 5,649 lb. of commercial\r\nbutter. The 60 cows milked daily earn about 15s. per head per month.\r\nAll the milking is done by machine. Last year 100 tons of oaten,\r\nwheaten, and lucerne chaff were sold at £4 10s. per ton. The Laver\r\nfamily also devote much attention to pig raising. A few years ago\r\nthey bred pure-bred Lincolns, and in 1912 fattened 27 merinos on an\r\nacre of rape. The land is of a rich chocolate nature, and is watered\r\nby Gogango Creek, several lagoons, and the Fitzroy River. Steps are\r\nto be taken at an early date to irrigate the farms by lifting the\r\nwater from the river by means of a pump, and then adopting natural\r\ngravitation. The Laver family, who started with plenty of money, are\r\nin a position to carry on their operations on a large scale. They\r\nestimate the cost of clearing their scrub land at £3 per acre. They\r\nstate that Queensland, particularly the Gogango Scrub portion of it,\r\nis the finest agricultural country in the Commonwealth. The climate,\r\ntoo, cannot be equalled.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   A Well-known Grazier’s Opinion.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Mr. John Moffat, of Camoola Park, a well-known\r\ngrazier in the Longreach district (Central Queensland), is of more\r\nthan ordinary interest. Mr. Moffat says:—\r\n\r\n“There were never better opportunities than the present in Queensland\r\nfor young men and women who have energy and ambition, and are not\r\nfrightened of honest work. I came from Scotland when a baby with my\r\nparents (emigrants) during the fifties to Adelaide, South Australia.\r\nMy father worked as a blacksmith, and afterwards as a carrier taking\r\ngoods to the Victorian goldfields, and subsequently began farming in\r\nNew South Wales. I had seven brothers and three sisters.\r\n\r\n“I left home without a shilling, and took to shearing during the\r\nseason, and did contract work at other times until I had enough\r\nmoney to select a half section (320 acres) in New South Wales. There\r\nI married, and in time increased my area sufficiently to carry on\r\nsheep-grazing and wheat-growing. In time I sold out to good advantage,\r\nand came to Queensland, where I am now a grazier. My brothers are all\r\nemployers of labour. I have reared and educated three sons and two\r\ndaughters. If I were a young man now with my usual health, I would not\r\nbe afraid to start life again under similar circumstances and present\r\nconditions. I attribute my success to perseverance and ambition, and\r\nusing the proceeds judiciously. Australia is a good field for any\r\nindustrious man or woman who sets his or her mind to honest work and\r\ntries to give satisfaction, as there are employments to suit nearly\r\nall classes of labour, as also for a man of moderate means, to take\r\nup a small farm in a suitable locality, especially after getting some\r\nexperience in one of the State Agricultural Colleges. I have been in\r\nthe State now nearly twenty years, and consider it a very good field\r\nfor emigrants.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Started Cane-growing with £147.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert P. Sneesby started sugar-growing on the Maroochy River,\r\nNorth Coast Line (South Queensland), with only £147. Four years ago\r\nhe arrived from the Clarence River (N.S.W.), where he was a dairyman\r\nand maize-grower. He took up 80 acres on the Maroochy River, for\r\nwhich he paid £8 per acre. This he cleared and cropped, and then\r\nsold for £1,800. Then he purchased his present holding of 153 acres\r\nof dense scrub, the price paid therefor being £4 5s. per acre. Other\r\nexpenditure—House, 18 ft. x 24 ft., £30; plough, £4 10s.; harrows,\r\n£4 10s.; scuffler, £2 12s.; hoes, mattocks, spades, &c., £1 10s.; 2\r\nhorses, £50; harness, £8; slide for cane haulage, £1; total, £102 2s.\r\n\r\nEstimate per acre for getting land ready for first crop—Brushing,\r\nfelling, burning, and clearing scrub, £4; holeing with mattock, £1\r\n17s. 6d.; plants, £1; planting, &c., £1; chipping (3), £3 15s.; total,\r\n£11 12s. 6d.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 he cut 215 tons of cane, and his crop of maize yielded 450\r\nbushels. From 12 acres of cane last season (1913) he harvested 370\r\ntons. The contract for cutting cane and haulage by punt across the\r\nriver entailed an expenditure of 6s. 9d. per ton. Mr. Sneesby has\r\nalso a dairy herd of twelve, consisting of grade Ayrshires and\r\nShorthorns. Regularly every week he sends 13 gallons of cream to the\r\nCaboolture Butter Factory. A dairy and separator is also established\r\non the farm. About 6 acres have been planted with bananas, 2 acres\r\nwith pineapples, and 1 acre with citrons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Another Successful Sugar-cane Grower.\r\n\r\nOne of the most successful growers in the Johnstone River district\r\n(North Queensland), is Mr. David Hunter, of Goondi. Prior to starting\r\ncane-growing eight years ago, he was overseer of labour for the\r\nColonial Sugar Refining Company at Goondi. He started with very little\r\ncapital, but the terms on which the Colonial Sugar Refining Company\r\nsold him land were so reasonable that he had no difficulty in not only\r\nmeeting his engagements, but also making a profit out of his labours.\r\nGood cultivation and manuring with mill refuse were the reasons for\r\nhis success. _His first season’s crop in 1906 yielded 1,820 tons, the\r\nnet profit therefrom, after paying all liabilities, being 3s. 4d. per\r\nton. In 1907 he cut 1,910 tons, and realised a net profit of 8s. per\r\nton; in 1908, 1,861 tons, net profit, 10s. 11d. per ton; in 1909,\r\n2,134 tons, net profit 11s. 6d. per ton; in 1910, 92 acres yielded\r\n2,832 tons, net profit 12s. 5d. per ton._ His average yield per acre\r\nfor six years was 28 tons. In addition to mill refuse, he used green\r\nand dry manures to fertilise his land. He paid his permanent field\r\nworkers 30s. per week and found. Yields for 1911-12:—1911: 90 acres,\r\n2,423 tons; 1912: 64 acres, 1,365 tons. The best yields per acre were\r\n43 tons in 1910 and 40 tons in 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Arrived with an Empty Pocket.\r\n\r\nMr. H. Denning, in responding to the toast of “The Pioneers,” at a\r\nbanquet at Mount Tarampa, in the Lowood district (South Queensland)\r\nin 1913, said:—“It was now 35 years since he became a resident of\r\nthe district. He arrived with an empty pocket, and on arrival found\r\nhe was compelled to cut a road 1-1/2 miles through scrub to get to\r\nthe boundary of his selection. He cleared 2 acres, and after six\r\nmonths harvested his first crop of maize and sweet potatoes. He hired\r\na wagon, and took a load into a firm in Ipswich. For the maize he\r\nreceived 9d. per bushel, and the sweet potatoes realised sufficient\r\nto pay the hire for the wagon, leaving him nothing for his labour.”\r\nHe added: “He had seen selectors compelled to walk 4 or 5 miles for\r\nwater, and carry it to their holdings in kerosene tins. Numerous times\r\nhe had seen children waiting for their father’s return with water so\r\nthat they could quench their thirst. Those were the days,” concluded\r\nMr. Denning, “when the settlers required ‘grit,’ and he could\r\ntruthfully say that they had abundance of it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n     Arrived in Queensland with Sixpence—Now a Well-to-do Farmer.\r\n\r\nOne of the best known identities in the Clifton district (Darling\r\nDowns, South Queensland) is Mr. Maas H. Hinz, J.P., typical pioneer,\r\nand one whose industry and perseverance have done so much to push on\r\nthat busy farming place, Clifton. Mr. M. H. Hinz was born in Holstein,\r\nGermany, in January, 1841. After leaving school he worked as a farm\r\nlabourer. Left the Fatherland for Queensland on 28th May, 1864, by the\r\nship “La Rochelle,” and landed in Brisbane on 6th September, the same\r\nyear. On landing all he\r\n\r\n                 _Possessed was a Solitary Sixpence!_\r\n\r\nAfter residing two days in the depôt he secured a job with a farmer\r\nnamed Mr. R. Wilson, of Biley Creek, at 10s. a week. Subsequent to six\r\nmonths with Mr. Wilson, Mr. Hinz got another job on the construction\r\nwork of the Ipswich-Toowoomba Railway line, and later on worked as a\r\nnavvy on the Dalby and Warwick lines. In 1867, when wages were very\r\nlow, he went across to the Burnett district, and took on shepherding\r\non Coringa Station. He remained in that district until 1870, and then\r\nreturned to the Toowoomba district, where he took up fencing and\r\nother contract work until 1872. The discovery of tin at Stanthorpe\r\nabout this time attracted his attention, and he went there to try his\r\nfortune in the tin rush. On 30th December, the same year, he took up\r\n760 acres on Back Plains, about 10 miles from Clifton. Three or four\r\nmonths after selecting he started working his land. For twelve months\r\nhis life was a lonely one. In December, 1873, he married, and, to use\r\nhis own words, “the taking up of a farm and the securing of a good\r\nwife I can safely say were the two best things I ever did in my life.”\r\nIn 1875 he selected another 320 acres. When he secured the last block\r\nthere were no less than thirty-two applicants. His luck was right in\r\non that occasion. In 1877 he bought from a neighbour 160 acres; and\r\nin 1893, when the Clifton Estate was sold, he purchased 960 acres\r\nadjoining his own property. In 1900 he bought 160 acres from a man\r\nleaving the district, and shortly afterwards purchased another 760\r\nacres of grazing land. It will thus be noticed that while working his\r\nfarm land,\r\n\r\n             _By Hard Work and Indomitable Perseverance,_\r\n\r\nhe gradually increased his holdings. During the whole of the time he\r\ncarried on mixed farming—dairying, maize and wheat growing, and sheep\r\nand horse breeding. Mr. Hinz is a magistrate of many years’ standing,\r\nand was a member of the divisional board for twelve years, once\r\noccupying the position of chairman. He was also chairman of the local\r\ncheese factory, school committee, School of Arts, and several other\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n            _Enjoying the Fruits of his Arduous Labours._\r\n\r\nHis life has been an active as well as useful one, and it is his\r\nprivilege now to enjoy the fruits of his arduous labours and early\r\nsettlement. Mr. Hinz toured the continent of Europe in 1900, and\r\nvisited the Paris Exhibition, as also the earlier scenes of his youth.\r\nHe has reared a family of eight children, five girls, and three boys.\r\nOn January, 1911, on attaining the age of 70, he gave over the farm\r\nlands to his three sons, who are now working the property on the same\r\nlines as himself, while he and his wife and two daughters are living\r\nprivately at Clifton. He and his good wife have worthily earned a\r\nrest, after putting in such good work in developing the district of\r\nClifton.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Happy and Contented Russian Settlers.\r\n\r\nMr. A. Mendrin, of Wycarbah, Central Queensland, under date 27th\r\nJuly, 1914, writes as follows:—“In 1912 I visited a large number\r\nof districts, as I intended taking up some land for agricultural\r\npurposes. I finally decided on a place near Rockhampton known as\r\nWycarbah Scrub, close to the Wycarbah Station, on the Queensland\r\nCentral Railway. I decided to start a mixed farm; the climatic and\r\nother conditions being extremely favourable for the growing and\r\ncultivating of maize, cotton, potatoes, and various sorts of citrus\r\nfruits. At the present time I must say that I am highly satisfied\r\nwith my land, so also with the terms and conditions offered me by the\r\nGovernment, and subject to which I received my land. As soon as I had\r\nsettled down at Wycarbah, and had started felling and clearing my\r\nland, I received numerous inquiries from a number of my countrymen,\r\nwho, knowing that I have a thorough theoretical and practical\r\nknowledge of agriculture in all its branches, requested me to assist\r\nthem in choosing land for agricultural and pastoral purposes. To the\r\nmajority of them I recommended the district where I had chosen my own\r\nfarm. The others whom I had not time to conduct and go round with\r\npersonally, I gave introductions to Mr. Harvey, of the Rockhampton\r\nLands Office, where they were given every attention and courtesy, so\r\nthat they did not feel in the least handicapped because of not knowing\r\nthe language. I now bring some of the cases of these men before you.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Started with only 100 Roubles (£10.)\r\n\r\n“Mr. Jacob Sank, in September, 1913, took over 160 acres of land at\r\n22s. 6d. per acre, with 20 years in which to effect payment, in the\r\ndistrict of Wycarbah, his whole capital at the time being some £10 =\r\nRs. 100. At the present time he has about 15 acres cleared and mostly\r\nunder crop, has built a house, possesses a horse, and intends buying\r\na cow shortly; he has also various agricultural implements. All this\r\nis very much to Mr. Sank’s credit, as, having no money on hand, he\r\nfrequently had to go outside to find work while his various crops were\r\ncoming up in order to make a living. Mr. Sank also intends having a\r\nmixed agricultural farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n             Russian Naval Gunner’s Success as a Farmer.\r\n\r\n“Mr. P. Hebenko, ex-torpedo-man on a battle cruiser, native of the\r\nBlack Sea district of Russia, arrived in Australia towards the end of\r\nJuly, 1913. He took up 160 acres of land near my farm in September,\r\n1913; it is good chocolate soil, and is under brigalow and light\r\nscrub. Shortly after having taken over his land, Mr. Hebenko got\r\nhis wife and three children from Russia, and they arrived here in\r\nNovember, 1913; whereupon Mr. Hebenko promptly left for his farm. I\r\nlast visited his farm in April, 1914. He had by that time cut down,\r\ncleared, and under crop 8 acres, 6 acres being under maize. He had\r\nalso built a house, and possessed a horse and various agricultural\r\nimplements. Having expended all his ready money, he then set off in\r\nsearch of work, which he obtained 9 miles from his home at 9s. per\r\nday, leaving his family on the farm well provided for by the various\r\nvegetables and fruits which were growing in the orchard. All his\r\nchildren visit an English school at Wycarbah Station, about 1-1/2\r\nmiles from his farm.\r\n\r\n“Both the settlers referred to above have expressed themselves highly\r\nsatisfied with everything, and especially with the fate that directed\r\nthem to Australia.\r\n\r\n“In addition to those mentioned above, the following also took land in\r\nthe vicinity of Wycarbah:—Messrs. Bikovsky, Pagin, and Krasnih.\r\n\r\n\r\n            We Do Not Repent having Left our Native Land.\r\n\r\n“In order to clearly show what a Russian’s opinion of Queensland\r\nis, I will now give a few extracts from a letter written by a Mr.\r\nGodalov, of Canungra, South Coast line, dated 24th February, 1911,\r\nand published in certain Russian newspapers:—’... and so I am to be\r\ncongratulated; 160 acres of superb land, with a healthy beautiful\r\nclimate, within 30 miles of the sea, at an elevation of 3,000 feet,\r\nand this for 32s. an acre and 20 years to pay it in. I consider it my\r\nduty to assure you that\r\n         _We do not Repent ever having left our Native Land,_\r\nnotwithstanding that my present social position is different to the\r\none I occupied in Russia, and also notwithstanding the fact that the\r\nlife here, too, is quite different to life in Russia; nevertheless,\r\nI have never yet thought that I came out here on a wild-goose chase\r\n(to say nothing of the children, who cry when we, jokingly, talk of\r\nreturning to Russia), in spite of the fact that my actual income—at\r\npresent—is smaller than it was in Russia, life here is in no case\r\nworse. The explanation makes this assertion obvious. I do not have\r\nto pay mad sums of money for the rent of my house, its heating, the\r\neducating and upbringing of my children, expensive warm clothing is\r\nunnecessary, there is no need for you to worry about to-morrow, and\r\nat last, but by no means leastly, for your own freedom and absolute\r\nliberty. All this gives a deep reason why Russians should emigrate to\r\nAustralia....’\r\n\r\n“As previously stated, the above are extracts from Mr. Godalov’s\r\nopen letter, he is well-known by the farmers of his district. Other\r\ncharacteristic cases are those of Messrs. Danilchenko and Ilyin, in\r\nNorth Queensland.\r\n\r\n“I satisfy myself with mentioning just these few cases, but, of\r\ncourse, there are a good many other similar cases amongst the Russian\r\ncolony in Queensland. I have taken the above cases at random, and\r\nthink that they clearly illustrate that a good, honest, and energetic\r\nRussian agriculturist cannot find a country with more favourable\r\nconditions than those offered him by Queensland for applying his\r\nknowledge and labour to.\r\n\r\n“In view of my having received a large number of inquiries as to the\r\nshortest space of time in which profit can be obtained from land still\r\nto be cleared, I, in the interests of intending emigrants, would like\r\nto give the following facts, which are based on my own experiences:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Mr. A. Mendrin’s Experiences.\r\n\r\n“We will say, then, that you have gone through the formalities of\r\nobtaining your land (in Queensland they are not complicated). From the\r\nfirst day of your arrival on your farm you will start cutting down\r\nyour trees (these are mostly soft), a normally healthy agricultural\r\npeasant should fell from 2 to 2-1/2 acres of brigalow scrub in a week.\r\nIn this way in a month’s time you should have about ten acres of\r\ntrees felled, provided you started this during the summer months. You\r\nwill want, say 2-1/2 months, for the fallen timber to dry before you\r\nburn it. Having burnt it, you promptly start sowing maize between the\r\nstumps, and while this is taking root you continue felling or putting\r\nup your fence, as the case may be. It will take about 105 days for\r\nyour maize to grow. You then pull the cobs, and prepare them for\r\ndrying and threshing, which should take about two weeks, at the end\r\nof which time you will be in a position to realise your first crop.\r\nVirgin soil in the district I am speaking of (Wycarbah) will yield\r\nabout 60 bushels of maize to the acre; that is, from 10 acres you will\r\nget 600 bushels; the average price is 3s. per bushel, or £90 for the\r\n10 acres you have cleared. In this way seven months have gone by since\r\nthe day on which you started work, and you have £90 in your pocket,\r\nless from £10 to £12 for various expenses, such as packing, delivery,\r\n&c. I would like to make it quite clear that I have taken only the\r\naverage price of maize above. Lately this article has been quoted at\r\nRockhampton at from 4s. to 4s. 3d. per bushel.\r\n\r\n“Knowing how popular pig and poultry breeding and farming is amongst\r\nRussian peasantry, I can say, with conviction, that these two yield a\r\nvery good source of income, as do all other branches of pastoral and\r\nagricultural enterprise, all of which I cannot give details of here in\r\nview of the space such information would take up.\r\n\r\n“Finally, I consider it my bounden duty to assert that my two years\r\nof careful study of agricultural and other conditions of life in\r\nQueensland give me good foundation on which to consider this country\r\nas the\r\n        _Most Convenient, Favourable, and Attractive Country_\r\nfor the average Russian agricultural or other peasant to emigrate to.\r\n\r\n“I have to express my thanks to the Lands Department for the kindness\r\nand attention shown by them in all cases when Russian subjects have\r\napproached them requesting advice and assistance.”\r\n\r\n_For fuller information in regard to the resources, modes of land\r\nselection, and general description of Queensland, see the booklet,\r\nentitled “Pocket Queensland.”_\r\n\r\n\r\nCompiled 31st December, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Authority: ANTHONY J.
