Whilst Arthur Young’s\r\nfamous ‘Travels in France’ have become a classic, little is known of the\r\nauthor’s life, a life singularly interesting and singularly sad. Whether\r\nregarded as the untiring experimentalist and dreamer of economic dreams,\r\nas the brilliant man of society and the world, or as the blind, solitary\r\nvictim of religious melancholia, the figure before us remains unique and\r\nimpressive. We have here, moreover, a strong character portrayed by\r\nhimself, an honest piece of autobiography erring, if at all, on the side\r\nof outspokenness. In his desire to be perfectly frank, the writer has\r\nlaid upon his editor the obligation of many curtailments, the Memoirs\r\nfrom beginning to end being already much too long. From seven packets of\r\nMS. and twelve folio volumes of correspondence I have put together all\r\nthat a busy public will probably care to know of Arthur Young—his\r\nstrength and weakness, his one success and innumerable failures, his\r\nfireside and his friends. One striking and instructive feature in this\r\nman’s history is his cosmopolitanism, his affectionate relations with\r\nFrenchmen, Poles, Russians, Danes, Italians, Scandinavians. Never\r\nEnglishman was more truly English; never Englishman was less narrow in\r\nhis social sympathies.\r\n\r\nThe religious melancholia of his later years is explicable on several\r\ngrounds: to the influence of his friend, the great Wilberforce; to the\r\ncrushing sorrow of his beloved little daughter ‘Bobbin’s’ death; lastly,\r\nperhaps, to exaggerated self-condemnation for foibles of his youth. Few\r\nlives have been more many-sided, more varied; few, indeed, have been\r\nmore fortunate and unfortunate at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe Memoirs, whilst necessarily abridged and arranged, are given\r\nprecisely as they were written—that is to say, although it has been\r\nnecessary to omit much, not a word has been added or altered. Whenever a\r\nword or sentence needed explanation or correction, the editorial note is\r\nbracketed. The foot-notes, unless when otherwise stated, are all\r\neditorial.\r\n\r\nFor the use of Memoirs and letters, &c., I am indebted to Mrs. Arthur\r\nYoung, widow of the late owner of Bradfield Hall, the last of Arthur\r\nYoung’s race and name, a gentleman alike in his public and private life\r\nwell worthy of his distinguished ancestry.\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur Young, who died last year, is buried beside the author of the\r\n‘Travels in France,’ in the pretty little churchyard of Bradfield, near\r\nBury St. Edmunds.\r\n\r\n                                                            M.

Elizabeth Mary. In examining the family\r\npapers from which the following detail is drawn, I should observe that\r\ndifficulties often occurred by reason of the ancient hand-writing of\r\nmany documents, and from several being written in the Latin language not\r\neasily deciphered; but the circumstances relative to the following dates\r\nwere clearly ascertained as far as they are noted. The principal object\r\nis the possession of the Manor of Bradfield Combust, which is traced in\r\nthe family of Canham till it came by marriage into that of Young.\r\nBartholomew Canham the elder had two sons and two daughters. In 1672 he\r\ntransferred Bradfield Hall, manor and lands to Arthur Young, married to\r\nElizabeth, his daughter. The Young shield bears a Field Argent, three\r\nBends sable and a Lyon rampant; that of Canham a Field Gule, Bend Argent\r\ncharged with a cannon ball sable, the Bend cotised with Or. The estate\r\nhad been purchased in 1620 by my ancestor of Sir Thomas, afterwards Lord\r\nJermyn of Rushbrooke, being part of the great possessions of that\r\nfamily. The steward who acted for Sir Thomas was Martin Folkes, ancestor\r\nof the present Sir Martin Folkes. And here it is curious to observe the\r\ndifferent results affecting the posterity of the private gentleman who\r\npurchases, and of the steward of the great man who sells—I am a poor\r\nlittle gentleman, and Sir Martin Folkes owner of an estate not far short\r\nof 10,000_l._ a year. My father, Dr. Arthur Young, inherited Bradfield\r\nfrom my grandfather, Bartholomew Young, Esq., called Captain from a\r\ncommand in the Militia, and it is remarkable that with only a part of\r\nthe present Bradfield estate he lived genteely and drove a coach and\r\nfour on a property which in these present times just maintains the\r\nestablishment of a wheel-barrow.\r\n\r\nDr. Arthur Young, my father, was educated at Eton and admitted to\r\nPembroke Hall, Cambridge, in 1710, afterwards settling at Thames Ditton,\r\nSurrey. He was so much liked by the inhabitants that they elected him,\r\nagainst a violent opposition of the inferior classes, minister of that\r\nparish. Whether the ladies of the place had a particular influence I\r\nknow not, but he was a remarkably handsome man and six feet high. It was\r\nhere he became acquainted with Miss Anne Lucretia de Cousmaker, to whom\r\nhe was afterwards married. She was the daughter of John de Cousmaker,\r\nEsq., who came to England with King William III., bringing with him a\r\nfortune of 80,000_l._, the greater part of which he was deprived of by\r\nthe imprudence of one or two of his sons. If ever there existed in human\r\nform an Israelite without guile, it was this worthy man; and it gives me\r\ngreat pleasure to reflect on the extreme respect and affection which\r\nwere always felt for him and my dear mother. Mr. de Cousmaker, my\r\nmaternal grandfather, was executor and residuary legatee to a Mrs.\r\nKeene, on which account he could have legally possessed himself of an\r\nestate left by her. With an honesty unexampled he would not take one\r\npenny of it, but exerted himself with incredible industry to discover\r\nsome distant relation to whom he might transfer the property. He did\r\nfind one who had no legal claim, and he gave him the estate. This Mr.\r\nKeene dying without issue, his widow told my grandfather that out of\r\ngratitude she would provide for two of his children. To a daughter she\r\nleft an annuity of 300_l._ a year, to a son an estate which passed on to\r\nhis descendants.\r\n\r\nMy mother brought a fortune to my father, the amount I know not, but it\r\nwas sufficient to demand the settlement of the Bradfield estate upon her\r\nfor life. She was of a very amiable, cheerful disposition, loved\r\nconversation, for which she had a talent, and read a great deal on\r\nvarious subjects. The residence at Thames Ditton resulted in a\r\nfriendship with the Onslow family, which proved highly advantageous to\r\nmy father. General, then Colonel Onslow, appointed him chaplain to his\r\nown regiment, and the General’s brother, Speaker of the House of\r\nCommons, also named him chaplain, a step which afterwards led to the\r\nprebendaryship of Canterbury. Mr. Speaker Onslow and the Bishop of\r\nRochester were my godfathers. Colonel, afterwards General Onslow, was in\r\nthe estimation of the world a highly respectable character, in the\r\nformation of which it may easily be supposed that religion formed no\r\npart from the following anecdote. One Sunday morning his wife obtained\r\nhis permission to read a chapter of the Bible, but he first bolted the\r\ndoor lest the servants should witness the performance. He was afraid\r\nthat the matter might reach the ears of his Commander-in-Chief, the Duke\r\nof Cumberland, who to much brutality of character added the abhorrence\r\nof a soldier troubling his head about religion.\r\n\r\nIn 1734 my father published his ‘Historical Dissertations on Idolatrous\r\nCorruptions in Religion,’ a very learned work which is quoted by\r\nVoltaire. In 1742 he was in Flanders acting as chaplain to Colonel\r\nOnslow’s regiment, and I have found among his papers the journal of a\r\ntour made through Brabant, Flanders, and a part of Picardy; on the\r\nwhole, it is interesting, and the cheapness of living therein described\r\nis remarkable. The following letter is from my father to his relation,\r\nhis Excellency Governor Vassy, relating to the conduct of General\r\nIngoldsby (who married my mother’s sister) at the battle of Fontenoy,\r\nand which throws a little additional light upon that transaction, though\r\nat the expense of the Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n                              ‘Bradfield Hall: July 22, 1745 (O.S.).\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—My last, which I wrote some time before our Parliament\r\n  broke up, was of such a length as I suppose has tired you of my\r\n  correspondence, since which I, having been here in the country, have\r\n  had nothing of news worth troubling you with. I make little doubt but\r\n  that our friend Ingoldsby’s behaviour has made much the same figure in\r\n  your publick papers as your Appius’s has done in ours. But I can\r\n  assure you, Sir, that, notwithstanding the account published in our\r\n  Gazette, he behaved like a good and a brave officer. A court-martial\r\n  has set upon him, but what the result of it is we know not as yet. But\r\n  fear the worst, since the clearing of him must reflect upon a King’s\r\n  son who has the command of an Army. I have enclosed his case, which\r\n  contains as much of the truth as he could have leave to print, at the\r\n  bottom of which you will find something wrote which his Royal Highness\r\n  commanded particularly to be left out. But if you, Sir, who are nearer\r\n  to the Army than we are, desire a more particular account of this\r\n  affair, your nephew Everet, who will continue here with us for more\r\n  than a month longer, shall give you the full detail of it.\r\n\r\n  ‘If, dear Sir, the gentleman who is the bearer of this shall want your\r\n  protection, I recommend him to it; he is going to the Army as my\r\n  substitute. His name is Gough, and is nephew to Captain Gough, who is\r\n  a member of the House of Commons and director of, and the great\r\n  manager in, our East India Company. All that I particularly ask in\r\n  behalf of him is that you will give him your directions how to find\r\n  our Army, and, if it be necessary, to halt in your garrison.\r\n\r\n                       ‘I am, dear Sir,\r\n                             ‘Your Excellency’s kinsman and servant,\r\n                                                         ‘T. YOUNG.’\r\n\r\nIngoldsby was cruelly used at the battle of Fontenoy by the Duke of\r\nCumberland, who had sent him orders to put himself at the head of a\r\ndetachment to attack a temporary redoubt which the French had thrown up,\r\nbut gave him no directions to take cannon; and when Ingoldsby arrived at\r\nthe spot he saw the necessity. He instantly dispatched his Aide-de-camp\r\nto demand cannon, but before they came the position of the troops\r\nchanged, and an order came to draw off. No consequences attended this\r\nbusiness, nor had it any effect on the loss of the battle; but an\r\nopportunity was taken to throw the whole blame on Ingoldsby, and to\r\nattach to him all the consequences of that defeat. Ingoldsby complained\r\nof this, and Ligonier himself came to him from the Duke to assure him\r\nthat the D. knew his bravery, and highly valued him, but advised him by\r\nall means to be quiet, and everything would blow over, and the business\r\nbe forgotten. Nothing had been said on the affair, but to save the\r\nreputation of the Duke. Mrs. Ingoldsby, losing all patience at his not\r\nbeing promoted according to promise, never let him rest till he\r\npublished his case, which put an end to all hope of promotion in the\r\nArmy, and he was obliged to retire. He was in all the Duke of\r\nMarlborough’s campaigns, and served with great reputation to the moment\r\nof the battle of Fontenoy.\r\n\r\nWhen I was of a proper age to be placed at school, a choice had to be\r\nmade between those of Bury St. Edmunds and Lavenham[1]; no possible\r\nmotive could induce any one to think of the latter, except the\r\ncircumstance of my father having been there himself. The master of the\r\nformer school, Mr. Kinsman, was one of the finest scholars of his age,\r\nand is mentioned with much respect by Cumberland in his memoirs.[2]\r\nWhilst the matter was in abeyance the Rev. M. Coulter, Master of\r\nLavenham School, came to Bradfield, and my mother, unfortunately for me,\r\nwas so much pleased with the extreme good temper manifested in his\r\ncountenance that she persuaded my father to entrust me to his care. I\r\nwas accordingly sent to that wretched place. I was to learn Latin and\r\nGreek, with arithmetic, but whether from being a favourite or from the\r\ndiversion of frequent visits home, I afterwards found myself so\r\nill-grounded in the above languages that for some time before I left the\r\nschool I found it necessary to give much attention to them in order to\r\nrecover the lost time. It is easy to suppose how much I was indulged\r\nfrom one instance among many others. At dinner the first dish the boys\r\nwere helped to was pudding, which I disliked, and was excused from\r\neating—the case of no other pupil. As to correction, I have no\r\nrecollection of receiving any thing of the sort.[3] I had, however, a\r\nsufficient awe of the Master. During the last years of my stay I had a\r\npointer and gun, and often went out with Mr. Coulter, he with a\r\npartridge net and I with my gun. I had a room to myself and a neat\r\ncollection of books. I remember beginning to write a history of England,\r\nthinking that I could make a good one out of several others. How early\r\nbegan my literary follies! I seemed to have a natural propensity for\r\nwriting books. The following bill for a year’s schooling and board must\r\nin the present period (about 1816) be considered a curiosity:—‘The Rev.\r\nDr. Young to John Coulter, Xmas 1750, to Xmas 1751. A year’s board, &c.\r\n15_l._ Sundries 2_l._ 4_s._ 4_d._ Total 17_l._ 4_s._ 4_d._’ I find from\r\na memorandum book of my mother’s that in 1746 beef was 3_d._, veal\r\n3_d._, and mutton 3½_d._ per pound at Bury.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1753 I was inoculated. This was a scheme of my mother’s\r\nwhich she had more than once proposed, but my father would not consent\r\nto it. Taking, however, the opportunity of his visit to Cambridge, she\r\nventured on the experiment. At this period inoculation was so little\r\nunderstood that it is utterly astonishing how anyone could escape;\r\ninstead of the cool regimen afterwards prescribed by Sutton,[4] the\r\npractice was to keep the patient’s chamber as close and hot as possible,\r\nthe shutters were kept up, and the door never opened without being shut\r\nspeedily. I suffered much, and Dr. Kerrich, the physician at Bury, for\r\nsome time attended every day. It pleased the Almighty that I should\r\nrecover, one of many instances in which His providence preserved a\r\nwretch who was to sin against Him by a multitude of offences. When my\r\nfather returned and I ran out to meet him, my mother exclaimed in a\r\ntriumphant tone, ‘There! I have had Arthur inoculated, and you enjoy the\r\ncomfort of knowing that your boy has had that terrible disorder.’ My\r\nfather looked at me, but neither spoke a word on the subject then nor\r\never after. This was his way—resolute in rejecting all proposals\r\ntouching upon novelty, and cool after their accomplishment. In an\r\ninferior circumstance he showed the same temper, as I will relate. The\r\nfamily pew at church was a wretched hole, lined with ragged cloth and\r\ncovered with dust; the pulpit also was tumbling with age and rottenness.\r\nOn my father’s going to London and leaving my brother at Bradfield, he\r\nbegged permission to have a new pew and pulpit. This was refused. ‘Good\r\nenough, Jack!’ said my father. But Jack attacked his mother, and set the\r\ncarpenter to work, who made a spacious pew, with one for the servants,\r\nnew pulpit and reading desk. The first Sunday my father went to church,\r\non approaching the place, he stopped short, surveyed all three with\r\ngreat attention, said nothing, and on joining the family party home\r\nnever opened his lips, nor ever after mentioned the subject. He was\r\ninwardly pleased, but not gracious enough to confess it. There was in\r\nDr. Young a strong mixture of obstinacy and _sang-froid_, as the\r\npreceding anecdotes prove.\r\n\r\nIn 1753 I went to London, and find by an old pocket-book that I saw Mr.\r\nGarrick in ‘Archer,’[5] heard the Oratorio, ‘The Messiah,’ spent an\r\nevening at Ranelagh, and viewed the Tower and St. Paul’s. I also\r\nremember visiting the widow of General Ingoldsby, who opened her house\r\nevery evening to all comers, nor was the number of fashionable people\r\ninconsiderable. John Wilkes, afterwards so well known, I met there more\r\nthan once; he was then considered a wit. Mrs. Ingoldsby made a point of\r\ngoing to Court at least twice a year, but I never heard her repeat any\r\nother conversation with the King than complaining to him how much she\r\nwas afflicted with rheumatism.\r\n\r\nIn 1754 died Mrs. Sidney Kennon, a lady highly respected and well known\r\nas the midwife to the Princess of Wales; she also brought into the world\r\nmy brother, sister and myself, and was a very old friend of my father’s,\r\nand him she left executor and residuary legatee. That her professional\r\nemoluments were of some consideration was proved by the fact of a\r\ngentleman after her decease presenting her executor with fifty guineas\r\nas her fee for having delivered his wife. By her will all her furniture\r\nand a great collection of medals, bronzes, shells, curiosities, books on\r\nnatural history, &c. with money in the funds, came into his possession,\r\nto the amount of nearly five thousand pounds. By a codicil she had\r\nordered that her servants should be retained and the house kept for six\r\nmonths after her death, in consequence of which our family moved into\r\nher residence in Clifford Street. It was, of course, to be expected that\r\nmy father would sell all the curiosities, but that a clergyman, a man of\r\nlearning, having a son of my brother’s attainments should dispose of\r\nsuch a collection, was not looked for; my maternal Uncle, de Cousmaker,\r\ndining one day at the house enquired as to my father’s intentions. On\r\nbeing informed that everything would go to an auction, he asked the\r\nprice. My father replied that the articles had not been valued, but he\r\nsupposed that they would fetch fifty or sixty pounds. Mr. de C. at once\r\noffered sixty guineas, the bargain was struck, and the books departed\r\nnext day, to our great mortification; the price was preposterous, as the\r\ncollection contained many curious and scarce publications, and my Uncle\r\nafterwards sold many of the duplicates for a greater amount than he had\r\ngiven for the whole, yet retaining a most valuable number. As a proof of\r\nthe worth of what might be called Mrs. Kennon’s Museum, I insert a\r\nletter to her from Sir Martin Folkes, President of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n  ‘Madame,—I am sorry I had not the happiness of seeing you when I was\r\n  last to wait on you, but will take another opportunity of paying my\r\n  respects. The worms you were pleased to send seem to me the very same\r\n  I received from Holland, and which I was in the utmost distress for,\r\n  being quite out, and my Polypes in great want, so that a word of\r\n  instruction, how I may get at some of these worms, will be a great\r\n  obligation. When I had the honour of leaving you a Polype, I had never\r\n  a one by me with a young one fairly put out, so here was one\r\n  beginning. I now beg leave to send you such a one; and when you are\r\n  disposed to cut one will wait on you, and show it you in a microscope,\r\n  if you have not yet seen it. I beg leave to return very many thanks\r\n  for the favour of seeing your noble collection of rarities, and have\r\n  hardly talked of anything else since.\r\n\r\n                  ‘I am, Madam, with the sincerest respect,\r\n                      ‘Your ladyship’s most obedient humble servant,\r\n                                                     ‘M. FOLKES.\r\n\r\n  ‘May 6, 1743.\r\n\r\nDoddington, in his diary, under the date of June 28, 1750, mentions\r\nsupping at this lady’s house, in company with Lady Middlesex, Lord\r\nBathurst, and Lady Torrington; and in the ‘World’ (No. 114) there is a\r\nhumorous paper on the distinctions between noble birth, great birth, and\r\nno birth, in which the writer says, ‘I never suspected that it could\r\npossibly mean the shrivelled tasteless fruit of an old genealogical\r\ntree. I communicated my doubts, and applied for information to my late,\r\nworthy, and curious friend, Mrs. Kennon, whose valuable collection of\r\nfossils and minerals, lately sold, sufficiently prove her skill and\r\nresearches in the most recondite parts of nature. She, with that\r\nfrankness and humanity which were natural to her, assured me that it was\r\nall a vulgar error, in which, however, the nobility and gentry prided\r\nthemselves; but that, in truth, she had never observed the children of\r\nthe quality to be wholesomer and stronger than others, but rather the\r\ncontrary, which difference she imputed to certain causes which I shall\r\nnot here specify.’ I possess several letters written to this lady by the\r\nGovernor of Bermuda, Mr. Popple, in 1739 and 1740, in which he considers\r\nher of sufficient importance to request that she would speak a good word\r\nfor him in behalf of his being removed to a better Government, or some\r\nother employment at home, and concludes a letter with saying, ‘I believe\r\nyour present power to assist your absent friends is now as great as I\r\nhave always thought your inclination was.’\r\n\r\nWhen my father returned to Bradfield, after passing the winter in\r\nLondon, he pulled down the old part of the house, a wretched lath and\r\nplaster ill-contrived building; then, to the astonishment of every one,\r\nhe employed a hedge carpenter to rebuild exactly on the old foundations.\r\nThereby was constructed a mansion which had not a single room free from\r\nevery fault that could be found, whether as to chimney, doors, windows,\r\nor connecting passages, and this at a larger expense than need have cost\r\nan excellent house. The new stables, with coach-house, brew-house and\r\noffices, were built of brick, and cost 500_l._ It was rather whimsical\r\nto give his horses, carriage, and brewery[6] the warmth of solid walls,\r\nand to house himself in lath and plaster; but in fixing his new\r\nfarmery,[7] a sad error was committed. The whole interposed between the\r\ndwelling, and four acres of turf dotted with beautiful oaks. My poor\r\nfather, however, did not live to enjoy his improvements, for he was very\r\nsoon seized with a dropsy, and which—as will be seen—terminated his\r\nlife. During one of his journeys to London in order to consult a doctor,\r\noccurred a circumstance so whimsical that I must mention it. Several\r\nsleepless nights made him take it into his head that anything would be\r\nbetter than a bed; as an experiment at one inn he ordered that a hole\r\nshould be cut in a haystack, in which he passed the night. But it is\r\ntime to return to myself. During all these years I was at Lavenham\r\nSchool reading Cæsar, Sallust, Homer and the Greek Testament, when a\r\nsudden whim seized my father, and he ordered Latin and Greek to be\r\ndiscarded and algebra to take their place. I thus became absorbed in\r\nSaunderson.[8] But what commanded more of my attention at this time was\r\na very different branch of learning, namely, the lessons of a dancing\r\nmaster; he came once a week from Colchester to teach the boys, also some\r\nyoung ladies of the neighbourhood, two of whom made terrible havoc with\r\nmy heart. The first was Miss Betsy Harrington, a grocer’s daughter,\r\nadmitted by all to be truly beautiful; the second of my youthful flames\r\nwas Miss Molly Fiske, a clergyman’s sister. For one or two years we\r\ncorresponded, but afterwards I went away, and she married the Rev. M.\r\nChevalier, of Aspall. Long after her marriage she told me that she had\r\naccepted that gentleman on finding that I did not come forward with the\r\nproposal. Her fortune was 4,000_l._\r\n\r\n              _Arthur Young, from his Sister Elisa Maria_\r\n\r\n                                                              ‘1755.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Brother,—I acknowledge it’s very long since I last wrote to you,\r\n  but I enclose you my excuses, and what was I assure you the occasion\r\n  of my delay. I designed making you a present of lace for a pair of\r\n  ruffles, and the weather had been so bad that it was too dirty for me\r\n  to go out and get them. I hope they will engage your approbation,\r\n  which is all I desire, and you’ll do me honor in wearing them. I’ve\r\n  not yet seen Miss Aspin, and believe I shall not till Monday, when we\r\n  propose going to Gen^l Onslow’s, and calling upon her in our way. We\r\n  have had so much rain lately that there has been no stirring, or I\r\n  would have made her a visit long ago.\r\n\r\n  ‘I believe I told my Mother my Uncle was disappointed of his company\r\n  which were to be here on Saturday last by Miss Turner being ill, but\r\n  she recovering we are to have the same party next week, and a very\r\n  grand concert it is to be, because we are musical people.\r\n\r\n  ‘Ranelagh is to be opened on the 8th with a rural carnival. I vastly\r\n  wished for you at Mrs. Cibber’s benefit. The play was “Tancred and\r\n  Sigismunda,” the plan of which you and I have often weep’d over\r\n  together in “Gil Blas.” It was most inimitably acted by Garrick and\r\n  Mrs. Cibber; you would have been vastly entertained. The play I was at\r\n  before, but went purposely to see the Princess of Wales and her\r\n  family. The Prince and Prince Edward were in one box, and the\r\n  Princess, Lady Augusta, Elizabeth, and Louisa in the other. Upon my\r\n  word, they are a fine parcel of children; only poor Elizabeth is,\r\n  unhappily, almost a dwarf, but the rest make very good figures.\r\n\r\n  ‘Monday your Aunt and I were in the House of Commons from one o’clock\r\n  at noon till nine at night; it was the Mitchell Election,[9] when the\r\n  great ones were setting themselves in combat against each other; it\r\n  was a most hard-fought battle. _The_[10] Duke espousing our party\r\n  against the Duke of Newcastle in support of the other, but the Tories\r\n  most of them going with the D. of N. gave him the majority. Though he\r\n  lost it at the Committee. There was much speaking, which was very\r\n  entertaining; Mr. Fox talked a great deal with great vehemence, for\r\n  this loss frustrates his schemes, as he finds the strength of the D.\r\n  of N.’s party though he had all the Army and the Duke’s Court people\r\n  with him. And now, Mr. Arthur, you being a very good polititian, I\r\n  shall proceed to entertain you with some more Parliamentary affairs.\r\n  Tuesday last the Message was brought from the King to the House. It\r\n  imparted little; nothing to be collected from it of either peace or\r\n  war. Only desiring the Parliament would support him in the armaments\r\n  he might have occasion for by sea and land, &c. &c. General Onslow\r\n  says during the eight and twenty years he has sat in that house he\r\n  never saw, or could have conceived it to be so unanimous in the\r\n  acclamations of the King. Every one striving who should in the\r\n  strongest terms express their confidence in him, Tories and all. Even\r\n  Sir John Phillips declared he would vote the King twenty shillings in\r\n  the pound, for that their lives and _whole_ fortunes were not too much\r\n  for him, and the House rung with their _confidence_ in the King,\r\n  without any one of the Ministers saying a syllable. They were the\r\n  silentest people. The General says he would have given any money\r\n  Miripoix[11] had been in the House to have heard the Parliament of\r\n  England’s hearty affection for their King. I should have much liked to\r\n  have been there, but the ladies’ privilege extends no farther than\r\n  elections. Lady Crosse sent to us on Monday morning at ten o’clock to\r\n  let us know she would call on us at eleven, and we had to dress in\r\n  gowns and petticoats and eat our breakfasts, which last was not to be\r\n  omitted, for it was certain we were to have no dinner. And by much\r\n  hurry we did get ready for her ladyship, but waited at her house for\r\n  Sir John till near one, frighted to excess, fearing we should not get\r\n  in. This Mitchell Election so famous an affair that all the town\r\n  wanted to hear it, and evidently the gallery would hold a small part\r\n  of them. However, we had the luck to get excellent places, having a\r\n  chair for one of us brought out of the Speaker’s chamber. The\r\n  elections for this year are now all over except the Oxfordshire, and\r\n  whether they will be able to finish that no one can tell. In answer to\r\n  this long letter I shall hope to hear very soon from you, and am,\r\n\r\n                                        ‘Your most affectionate\r\n                                                       ‘E.

I should have wrote to you before now, but have so\r\n  many letters perpetually upon my hands that no clerk to an attorney\r\n  has more pen exercise. I want much to have a particular account of the\r\n  Bury Assizes; I suppose you will go to an Assembly, and therefore pray\r\n  you to send me intelligence of who and who are together, who dresses\r\n  smartest, looks best, and seems most pleased with themselves and those\r\n  about them. The balls here are vastly disagreeable. I dance French\r\n  dances constantly, but none of the people of fashion dance country\r\n  dances; there are such numbers of Bristol people that do, and they are\r\n  such an ordinary set that it prevents the fine folks. The rooms of\r\n  another night are much cleverer; there is a lottery table which we\r\n  play at from eight till half an hour after nine most nights. My Aunt\r\n  and I have both hitherto played with great success. The principal\r\n  support of our table we lose to-day, Mr. Brudenell, member for\r\n  Rutlandshire, an extreem good-natured, pretty kind of man; the company\r\n  is going off so fast and the place is so thin, that I fear we shall\r\n  miss him very much. My Aunt sends her love to you. She says she made\r\n  you a promise of giving you a pair of lace ruffles or a guinea, which\r\n  ever you chose, and desires you will consult with your mother which\r\n  you will have, and if the lace, let her know it; for it’s sold here as\r\n  well as at Bath. I should advise the money; for you have two pair of\r\n  lace ruffles which I am sure is as much as you can possibly have\r\n  occasion for; those you have must be taken off the footings, for the\r\n  fine men weer them extreemly shallow; they should not be near a nail\r\n  of a yard deep.\r\n\r\n  ‘Pray make my compliments to everybody that enquires after me, and let\r\n  me have a very long letter from you very soon.

Yesterday was the\r\n  second day of using it, cost him 82_l._; it’s very handsome, all but\r\n  being painted in a mosaic, which all the smart equipages are. Miss\r\n  Joy’s mother has made one this spring, cost 147_l._ There is hardly\r\n  such a thing seen as a two-wheeled post-chaise; nobody uses anything\r\n  but four-wheeled ones, and numbers of them with boxes put on and run\r\n  for chariots, and vastly pretty they are.\r\n\r\n  ‘Now I must give you some account of the masquerade at Mrs. Onslow’s;\r\n  Lady Onslow was there, Mr. and Mrs. Onslow, the Mr. Shelley we met at\r\n  the Speaker’s, and Miss Freeman. Lady Onslow was in a Venetian domino\r\n  white lustring trimmed with scarlet and silver blonde. Mrs. Onslow’s\r\n  dress we thought not at all pretty nor becoming; she had no jewels on,\r\n  but was ornamented with mock pearl. Mr. Onslow was in a domino, as was\r\n  Mr. Shelley; the first was very genteel and handsome, white lustring\r\n  trimmed with an open shining gold lace and little roses of purple with\r\n  gold in the middle of them. I never saw anything prettier. Miss\r\n  Freeman was the sweetest figure I ever saw. Her dress, a dancer, blue\r\n  satin trimmed with silver in the richest genteelest taste and very\r\n  fine jewels. They say Fenton Harvey was the best figure there amongst\r\n  the gentlemen, with his masque; on his dress was a domino which was\r\n  reckoned the genteelest dresses.\r\n\r\n  ‘Lady Coventry, amongst the ladies, was the best figure; Lady Peterson\r\n  another much admired. The Town said beforehand that she was to be Eve\r\n  and wear a fig leaf of diamonds; however, this was not true.’\r\n\r\n         _Mrs. Tomlinson (née Elisa Maria Young) to her Father_\r\n\r\n  ‘Honoured Sir,—Mr. Tomlinson and myself are your urgent petitioners\r\n  for a favour which, if granted, will give us very great pleasure.

Be\r\n  pleased to direct him to have his linnen washed, stocking (_sic_)\r\n  mended, &c., and in case he comes on horseback, it may not be amiss to\r\n  hint to him that he is not to reach London on one gallop, for his\r\n  impatience may outrun his prudence. It was a great pleasure to hear a\r\n  pretty good account of your health, and hope we shall hear often from\r\n  Bradfield during my mother’s stay here.\r\n\r\n  ‘Beg my love with Mr. T.’s to my brother.

M. TOMLINSON.\r\n\r\n  ‘Bucklersbury: Tuesday night, 10 o’clock (1757).’\r\n\r\nWhilst at school I made in the playground a famous fortification, and\r\nthen besieged it with mines of gun-powder, nearly blowing up two boys\r\nand an old woman selling pies. A better example was my habit of reading,\r\nwhich became a sort of fashion. I was thought to be of an uncommon\r\nstamp, and when the pupils returned home their parents became desirous\r\nof seeing the lad to whom they thought themselves indebted. My own\r\nacquisitions received a mortal shock on the marriage of my sister with\r\nMr. Tomlinson, of the firm of Tomlinson & Co. The opportunity of\r\nintroducing me into their counting-house was thought advantageous by my\r\nfather, and in consequence orders came that I should receive immediate\r\ninstruction in mercantile accounts; as a further preparation the sum of\r\n400_l._ was paid to Messrs. Robertson, of Lynn, Norfolk, for a three\r\nyears’ apprenticeship.\r\n\r\nIn February 1758 I took my last farewell of Lavenham, and paid a visit\r\nto my married sister in London. I remember nothing more of this visit\r\nthan several performances of Mr. Garrick. When I took leave of my\r\nsister, who was far advanced in her pregnancy, she wept and said she\r\nmight never see me more. This proved to be the case, as she died during\r\nher lying-in. She was a remarkably clever woman, with much beauty and\r\nvivacity of conversation, combined with much solidity of judgment. My\r\nmother grieved so much for her loss that she could never be persuaded to\r\ngo out of mourning, but mourned till her own death, nor did she ever\r\nrecover her cheerfulness. This had one good effect, and that a very\r\nimportant one for me; she never afterwards looked into any book but on\r\nthe subject of religion, and her only constant companion was her Bible,\r\nherein copying the example of her father.\r\n\r\nEvery circumstance attending this new situation at Lynn was most\r\ndetestable to me till I effected an improvement. This was done by hiring\r\na lodging, surrounding myself with books, and making the acquaintance of\r\nMiss Robertson, daughter of my employer’s partner. She was of a pleasing\r\nfigure, with fine black expressive eyes, danced well, and also sang and\r\nperformed well on the harpsichord; no wonder, as she received\r\ninstructions from Mr. Burney.[12] He was a person held in the highest\r\nestimation for his powers of conversation and agreeable manners, which\r\nmade his company much sought after by all the principal nobility and\r\ngentry of the neighbourhood. Here I must reflect, as I have done many\r\ntimes before, on the unfortunate idea of making me a merchant. The\r\nimmediate expense absolutely thrown away differently invested would have\r\nkept me four years at the University, enabling my father to make me a\r\nclergyman and Rector of Bradfield. This living he actually gave to my\r\nLavenham schoolmaster. The whole course of my life would in such a case\r\nhave been changed. I should have known nothing of Lynn, and have taken a\r\nwife from a different quarter. I should probably have been free from all\r\nattraction to agriculture, and that circumstance alone would have\r\nchanged the whole colour of my existence. I might never have been of any\r\nuse to the public, but my years would have passed in a far more tranquil\r\ncurrent, escaping so many storms and vicissitudes which blew me into a\r\ntempest of activity and involved me in great errors, great vice, and\r\nperpetual anxiety. This was not to be the case, and what I thought an\r\nevil star sent me to Lynn. In this place monthly assemblies were held, a\r\nmayor’s feast and ball in the evening, a dancing master’s ball and\r\nassemblies at the Mart. It was not common, I was told, for merchants’\r\nclerks to frequent these, a suggestion I spurned, and attended them,\r\ndancing with the principal belles. I was complimented by the dancing\r\nmaster, who assured me that he pointed out my minuet as an example to\r\nhis scholars. But pleasure alone would not satisfy me; I was by nature\r\nstudious, and from my earliest years discovered a thirst for learning\r\nand books. These, the smallness of my allowance (I think not more than\r\n30_l._ per annum), with my great foppery in dress for the balls, would\r\nnot permit me to purchase and supply me with what I so much needed.\r\nAccordingly in 1758 I compiled a political pamphlet named ‘The Theatre\r\nof the Present War in North America,’ for which a bookseller allowed me\r\nten pounds’ worth of books; as he urged me to another undertaking I\r\nwrote three or four more political tracts, each of which procured me an\r\naddition to my little library. My first year’s apprenticeship had not\r\nexpired before the death of my sister overthrew the whole plan which had\r\nsent me to Lynn. As 400_l._ had been paid for the agreed period of three\r\nyears, I was kept there from no other motive. Under such circumstances\r\nit may be supposed that the counting-house and the business received not\r\nan atom more of attention than could be dispensed with. I was twenty\r\nyears old on leaving Lynn, which I did without education, profession or\r\nemployment. In June of this year (1759) my father died, and as he left\r\ndebts, my mother thought it necessary to take an exact account of his\r\neffects. The following is the result:—\r\n\r\n                                            £  _s._\r\n                    Household goods       674     1\r\n                    Farming stock         226     4\r\n                    Plate                 149    13\r\n                    Books                  57     0\r\n                                          —-—    ——\r\n                          Total        £1,106    18\r\n\r\nI am sorry to add that money or money due to him made no part of the\r\nestimate. The fact was that my father died much in debt, and it was two\r\nyears before my mother found herself tolerably free.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Lavenham is a very pretty village, with splendid church, lying between\r\n  Sudbury and Whelnethan, whilst Bury St. Edmunds is the second town in\r\n  Suffolk.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  _Memoirs of Richard Cumberland_, 1806.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Elsewhere Arthur Young mentions a severe flogging ‘very properly’\r\n  administered by his father for an act of cruelty, adding, ‘It was the\r\n  only time that I ever received any correction at his hands, yet he was\r\n  a remarkably passionate man.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Robert Sutton, physician and inoculist, 1757, _Dict. of Biography_,\r\n  Sampson Low.

On this visit to London I had a mind to see\r\neverything, and ordered a full dress suit for going to Court. This was\r\nin September. In December I was again in London figuring in the gay\r\nworld.[13] In January 1762 I set on foot a periodical publication\r\nentitled ‘The Universal Museum,’ which came out monthly, printed with\r\nglorious imprudence on my own account. I waited on Dr. Johnson, who was\r\nsitting by the fire so half-dressed and slovenly a figure as to make me\r\nstare at him. I stated my plan and begged that he would favour me with a\r\npaper once a month, offering at the same time any remuneration that he\r\nmight name. ‘No, sir,’ he replied, ‘such a work would be sure to fail if\r\nthe booksellers have not the property, and you will lose a great deal of\r\nmoney by it.’ ‘Certainly, sir,’ I said; ‘if I am not fortunate enough to\r\ninduce authors of real talent to contribute.’ ‘No, sir, you are\r\nmistaken, such authors will not support such a work, nor will you\r\npersuade them to write in it; you will purchase disappointment by the\r\nloss of your money, and I advise you by all means to give up the plan.’\r\nSomebody was introduced, and I took my leave. Dr. Kenrick,[14] the\r\ntranslator of Rousseau, was a writer of a very different stamp; he\r\nreadily engaged to write for me; so did Collier[15] and his wife, who\r\nbetween them translated the ‘Death of Abel.’[16] I printed five numbers\r\nof this work, and being convinced that Dr. Johnson’s advice was wise and\r\nthat I should lose money by the business, I determined to give it up.\r\nWith that view I procured a meeting of ten or a dozen booksellers, and\r\nhad the luck and address to persuade them to take the whole scheme upon\r\nthemselves. I fairly slipped my neck out of the yoke—a most fortunate\r\noccurrence, for, though they continued it under far more favourable\r\ncircumstances, I believe no success ever attended it.\r\n\r\nIn September of the following year I broke a blood-vessel and was\r\nattended by a Lynn physician, who ordered me to Bristol Hotwells, as I\r\nwas in a very consumptive state. I accordingly went, boarding and\r\nlodging in a house where I met very intelligent and agreeable society;\r\namongst the number was one gentleman with whom I had many arguments\r\nconcerning Rousseau and his writings, I, like a fool, much admiring\r\nboth, my new acquaintance abusing them with equal heat. But the\r\nprincipal acquaintance I made at the Hotwells was Sir Charles Howard,\r\nK.B., then an old man. Being informed that I was a chess-player, he\r\nintroduced himself to me in the pump-room and invited me to coffee and a\r\ngame of chess. After some time and various conversations he made\r\nenquiries relating to my family and destination. I took it into my head\r\nthat he seemed more affable when he was informed (for his enquiries were\r\nnumerous) that Mr. Speaker Onslow and the Bishop of Rochester were my\r\ngodfathers. On understanding that I was not bred to any profession and\r\nwas without hope of any settlement in life, he asked me if I should like\r\nto enter the Army. I answered in the affirmative, but added that it\r\ncould only be matter of theory, as I had not lived with any officers. He\r\noften recurred to the idea, and at last told me that he would give me a\r\npair of colours in his own cavalry regiment, and bade me write to my\r\nmother for her approval.\r\n\r\nThis I did, and was not at all surprised by her reply. She begged and\r\nbeseeched me not to think of any such employment, as my health and\r\nstrength were quite inadequate to the life. I loved my dear mother too\r\nmuch to accept an offer against her consent. I also became acquainted\r\nwith an officer in the Army, Captain Lambert, who visited the Countess\r\nof B. at B. Castle. She was esteemed a demirep, handsome and\r\nfascinating. A little before I left Bristol I was introduced to her, and\r\nhad my stay been longer should have made one in the number of her many\r\nslaves. On returning from Bristol to my mother at Bradfield, I found\r\nmyself in a situation as truly helpless and forlorn as could well be\r\nimagined, without profession, business, or pursuit, I may add without\r\none well-grounded hope of any advantageous establishment in life. My\r\nwhole fortune during the life of my mother was a copyhold farm of twenty\r\nacres, producing as many pounds, and what possibility there was of\r\nturning my time to any advantage did not and could not occur to me; in\r\ntruth, it was a situation without resource, and nothing but the\r\ninconsiderateness of youth could have kept me from sinking into\r\nmelancholy and despair. My mother, desirous of fixing me with her,\r\nproposed that I should take a farm, and especially as the home one of\r\neighty acres was under a lease expiring at Michaelmas. I had no more\r\nidea of farming than of physic or divinity, but as it promised, at\r\nleast, to find me some employment, I agreed to the proposition, and\r\naccordingly commenced my rural operations, which entirely decided the\r\ncomplexion of all my remaining years. My connections at Lynn carried me\r\noften to that place, and my love of reading proved my chief resource. I\r\nfarmed during the years 1763-4-5-6, having taken also a second farm that\r\nwas in the hands of a tenant. I gained knowledge, but not much, and the\r\nprincipal effect was to convince me that in order to understand the\r\nbusiness in any perfection it was necessary for me to continue my\r\nexertions for many years. And the circumstance which perhaps of all\r\nothers in my life I most deeply regretted and considered as a sin of the\r\nblackest dye, was the publishing the result of my experience during\r\nthese four years, which, speaking as a farmer, was nothing but\r\nignorance, folly, presumption, and rascality. The only real use which\r\nresulted from those four years was to enable me to view the farms of\r\nother men with an eye of more discrimination than I could possibly have\r\ndone without that practice. It was the occasion of my going on the\r\nsouthern tour in 1767, the northern tour in 1768, and the eastern in\r\n1770, extending through much the greater part of the kingdom, and the\r\nexertion in these tours was admitted by all who read them (and they were\r\nvery generally read) to be of most singular utility to the general\r\nagriculture of the kingdom. In these works I particularly attended to\r\nthe course of the farmer’s crops, the point perhaps of all others the\r\nmost important, and the more so at that period, because all preceding\r\nwriters had neglected it in the most unaccountable manner. They relate\r\ngood and bad rotations with the same apathy as if it was of little\r\nconsequence in what order the crops of a farm were put in provided the\r\noperations of tillage and manuring were properly performed.\r\n\r\nIt has been very justly said that I first excited the agricultural\r\nspirit which has since rendered Britain so famous; and I should observe\r\nthat this is not so great a compliment as at first sight it may seem,\r\nsince it was nothing more than publishing to the world the exertions of\r\nmany capital cultivators and in various parts of the kingdom, and\r\nespecially the local practice of common farmers who, with all their\r\nmerit, were unknown beyond the limits of their immediate district, and\r\nwhose operation wanted only to be known to be admired.\r\n\r\nIn December 1762 I was again in London, and, as usual, constantly at the\r\ntheatre. The parts in which Mr. Garrick acted to my great entertainment\r\nwere, Macbeth, Benedict, Lear, Posthumus, Oakely,[17] Abel Drugger,[18]\r\nSir J. Brute,[19] Sir J. Dominant,[20] Bayes,[21] Carlos,[22] Felix,[23]\r\nRanger,[24] Scrub,[25] Hastings.[26] I must once for all remark that\r\nthis astonishing actor so much exceeded every idea of representing\r\ncharacter that the delusion was complete, Nature, not acting, seemed to\r\nbe before the spectator, and this to a degree a thousand times beyond\r\nanything that has been seen since. The tones of his voice, the clear\r\ndiscrimination of feeling and passion in the vast variety of characters\r\nhe represented, surpassed anything one could imagine, and raised him\r\nbeyond competition. I have often reflected on the principal personages\r\nwho figured in England during this age, and I am disposed to think that\r\nGarrick was by far the greatest, that is to say, he excelled all his\r\ncontemporaries in the art he professed. Few men have been able to laugh\r\nat their own foibles with as much wit as Garrick. A striking instance\r\nwas his little publication called ‘An Ode to Garrick on the Talk of the\r\nTown,’ in which we find this stanza:\r\n\r\n                Two parts they readily allow\r\n                Are yours, but not one more they vow,\r\n                  And they close their spite.\r\n                You will be Sir John Brute[27] all day,\r\n                  And Fribble[28] all the night.\r\n\r\nIn 1765 the colour of my life was decided. I married. My wife[29] was a\r\ndaughter of Alderman Allen, of Lynn, and great-granddaughter of John\r\nAllen, Esq., of Lyng House, Norfolk, who, according to the Comte de\r\nBoulainvilliers,[30] first introduced the custom of marling in the\r\nabove-named county. We boarded with my mother at Lynn.\r\n\r\nThis year (1765) I was in correspondence with the Rev. Walter Harte,[31]\r\nCanon of Windsor, and author of the ‘Essays on Husbandry’ and the ‘Life\r\nof Gustavus Adolphus.’ He advised me to collect my scattered papers in\r\nthe ‘Museum Rusticum,’ and, with additions, to publish them in a volume.\r\nThis I did under the title of ‘A Farmer’s Letters.’ I visited Mr. Harte\r\nat Bath; his conversation was extremely interesting and instructive. I\r\nhave rarely received more pleasure than in my intercourse with this\r\namiable and deeply learned man. It is well known that he was tutor to\r\nMr. Stanhope, natural son of Lord Chesterfield, to whom so many of that\r\nnobleman’s letters were addressed.[32]\r\n\r\n                             _To Mr. Harte_\r\n\r\n                                       ‘Blackheath: August 16, 1764.\r\n\r\n  ‘Sir,—I give you a thousand thanks for your book, of which I’ve read\r\n  every word with great pleasure and full as great astonishment. When in\r\n  the name of God could you have found time to read the ten or twenty\r\n  thousand authors whom you quote, of all countries and all times, from\r\n  Hesiod to du Hamel?[33] Where have you ploughed, sowed, harrowed,\r\n  drilled, and dug the earth for at least these forty years? for less\r\n  time could not have made you such a complete master of the practical\r\n  part of husbandry. I can only account for it from the Pythagorean\r\n  doctrine of the transmigration of souls, and the supposition that\r\n  Hartlib’s soul has animated your body with a small alteration of name;\r\n  seriously, your book entertains me exceedingly, and has made me quite\r\n  a _dilettante_, though too late to make me a _virtuoso_, in the useful\r\n  and agreeable art of agriculture. I own myself ignorant of them all,\r\n  but am nevertheless sensible of their utility, and the pleasure it\r\n  must afford to those who pursue them. Moreover, you’ve scattered so\r\n  many graces over them that one wishes to be better acquainted with\r\n  them, and that one reads your book with pleasure most exquisite. It is\r\n  the only prose Georgic that I know, as agreeable, and I dare say much\r\n  more useful, in this climate than Virgil. Why have you not put your\r\n  name to it? for though some passages in it point you out to be the\r\n  author here, they will not do it so in other countries, and as I am\r\n  persuaded that your book will be translated into most modern languages\r\n  and be a polyglott of husbandry, I could have wished your name had\r\n  been to it. How goes the Havabilious complaint: has not the Bath\r\n  waters washed it away yet? I heartily wish it was, as I sincerely wish\r\n  you whatever can give you ease or pleasure.\r\n\r\n                    ‘For I am with great truth your\r\n                                       ‘Faithful friend and servant,\r\n                                                    ‘CHESTERFIELD.\r\n\r\n  ‘P.S.—Though I can be as partial as another to my friends, I cannot be\r\n  quite blind to their omissions; for though you have enumerated so many\r\n  sorts of grass, with a particular panegyrick on your dear Lucern, you\r\n  have not described, nor so much as mentioned, that particular sort of\r\n  grass _which while it grows the steed starves_.\r\n\r\n  ‘Your Elève is very well at Dresden. I will send him his book when I\r\n  can find a good opportunity.’\r\n\r\nThe following letters Mr. Harte was so good as to address to me:—\r\n\r\n                                            ‘Bath: February 3, 1765.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—That I am obliged to trouble you with a letter, purely on\r\n  my own account, I balance not a moment within myself, between\r\n  interrupting a friend and being thought ungrateful. The kind mention\r\n  you have been pleased to make of my Essays on Husbandry in the last\r\n  number of the Museum Rusticum deserves my warmest thanks and\r\n  acknowledgements: and though your good opinion of me as _bonus\r\n  agricola, bonus civis_ may be a little partial, yet sure I am that\r\n  your favourable report is the overflowing of a generous mind, and\r\n  under that medicament I must with modesty and diffidence arrange it,\r\n  feeling at the same time that inward pleasure which Tacitus describes\r\n  _Dulce est laudari a laudato Viro_. For my own part, my ill health, as\r\n  I greatly fear, will make me unable to continue much longer on the\r\n  theatre of agriculture; but if it pleases God that this nation is ever\r\n  touched with a true vital sense of the uses of husbandry in _their\r\n  full extent_ (and runs not mad with the visionary notions of\r\n  Colonies), there will soon be a succession of younger and abler\r\n  genius’s to perfect _that_, which I have had the honor and\r\n  satisfaction of suggesting to my beloved but mistaken country. I may\r\n  say as old Dryden did to Congreve. (You will put aside the vanity of\r\n  naming Dryden in the same paragraph with myself.)\r\n\r\n              ‘So, when the States one Edward did depose,\r\n              A greater Edward in his room arose,\r\n              But now not I but husbandry the curst,\r\n              And Tom the Second writes like Tom the First.\r\n\r\n  ‘And now, Sir, give me leave to assure you that I am extremely pleased\r\n  with your last published performance, and the rather as the idea is\r\n  useful and new. In order to send abroad a truly qualified person, as\r\n  you have most judiciously characterised him, you do well to address\r\n  yourself to noble-spirited individuals. Kings and ministers look upon\r\n  agriculture as only _physical_ means of supplying mankind with food;\r\n  nor does one glimpse of an idea ever enter their heads or hearts\r\n  concerning the circulation of profit from the highest to the lowest\r\n  resulting from thence; nor of the national strength, health,\r\n  population, and, I may say, the sobriety of getting money which\r\n  results from that art when it is exercised and maintained in full\r\n  activity. France might till this time have languished for her\r\n  enclosure of waste land and exportation of superfluous corn if a\r\n  shrewd and artful foreigner had not flattered a fair lady into a\r\n  passion for agriculture; the man I mean is M. Patulle.[34] And indeed,\r\n  since the times of Augustus and Mæcenas (which latter loved\r\n  agriculture, before he loved poetry, but lavishly united both in\r\n  Virgil) and since the time of Constantine IV. to the present hour I\r\n  can recollect no Princes and Prime Ministers who understood the\r\n  national advantages of husbandry in their full extent but Henry IV.\r\n  and Sully.’ [_Letter breaks off here._]\r\n\r\n                                              ‘Windsor: May 1, 1765.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—Your last kind pacquet was conveyed to me here by our much\r\n  esteemed friend Mrs. Allen, whom I hope to see at Bath in about twelve\r\n  days. I am now to thank you for entertaining me with so much and so\r\n  good matter relating to Harrows, and look upon your improvement to be\r\n  a most sensible and most ingenious one at the same time. This is the\r\n  happy perfection in writing which Horace mentions:\r\n\r\n               ‘Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci.\r\n\r\n  ‘In the same manner I have also read with delight and improvement your\r\n  remarks upon broad-wheeled waggons, in the Museum for last March: but\r\n  why, my good friend, do you bury such dissertations as yours in\r\n  blue-paper Periodical Essays? Or why rather do you not throw them\r\n  together in one book, or large pamphlet? I return you my best thanks\r\n  for your Technical Terms of Art in the Suffolk Husbandry, and the\r\n  provincial words, which latter, one time or other, shall be considered\r\n  by me in a more extensive and critical view respecting the English\r\n  language in general. Many of these provincial words[35] are the truly\r\n  classical words of our nation. Some of them are elegant and musical,\r\n  and most of them in general express the sense in their sound. In one\r\n  word, from a thorough knowledge of the provincial words of our\r\n  language, one might venture to explain Shakespear, B. Jonson, Beaumont\r\n  and Fletcher, &c., better and safer than all his editors and\r\n  conjectural critics. If you have a friend tolerably skilled in\r\n  husbandry, who lives in any part of England except the southern and\r\n  western, be so obliging to me as to solicit his assistance, and convey\r\n  the list of words to me; for by what I have before suggested, you see\r\n  I have views that extend beyond husbandry.\r\n\r\n  ‘When you go to London, will you not be tempted to make a flying\r\n  excursion to Bath? ’Tis a digression, but it can hardly be called an\r\n  episode.

Were I condemned to this punishment I would desire my footman to\r\n  hold the pen—and even _then_ what would such critics say? They would\r\n  find fault with inelegance and want of propriety in the work. They\r\n  bring to my mind an anecdote which de Voltaire once told me of his\r\n  father (by the way, Voltaire put the incident into a farce, and was\r\n  disinherited for it). The peevish old gentleman said one morning when\r\n  his son rose from bed at about 11 o’clock: “Young man, you were drunk\r\n  last night; you will sleep away your senses, neglect your studies, and\r\n  die a beggar.” Piqued at this reproach, Voltaire got up at 4 next\r\n  morning, and by the by it was in winter. “Son,” said his father at\r\n  breakfast, “you will ruin us in the expenses of fire and candle. All\r\n  your draggle-tailed Muses will never indemnify us with the\r\n  wood-merchant and chandler.” This is a just picture of a reviewing\r\n  Critic or a Mago.\r\n\r\n                 ‘Quo teneam vultus mutantem Protea noto?\r\n\r\n  ‘As to the Museum Rusticum (your writings in it excepted) I know\r\n  nothing of the authors, but look upon it (as I am now speaking to you\r\n  _sub sigillo silentii_) as a blue-paper job. Books in this age are a\r\n  manufacture as much as hats or pins. The bookseller chooses a subject\r\n  and the author writes at 10_s._ a sheet. It is probable that one man\r\n  in a garret, who does not know a blade of wheat from a blade of\r\n  barley, writes half the letters from the ‘Kentish man,’ ‘Yorkshire\r\n  man,’ ‘Glocester man,’ &c. And perhaps the same hand, in the notes,\r\n  signs with all the letters in the alphabet. Perhaps this very man\r\n  Rocque (I speak only from conjecture), for I observe the whole work\r\n  has a tendency to favour this avanturier in agriculture. I declare to\r\n  you seriously that I know nothing of its authors, you excepted. Might\r\n  it not be better if you kept your admirable tracts by you, and to\r\n  those you have already published, so much to your honour, you may add\r\n  such occasional pieces as you shall afterwards write, and let them all\r\n  appear together in a volume which might be entitled SYLVAE,[37] or\r\n  occasional tracts on husbandry and rural economics. I would have all\r\n  books on husbandry, if possible, pocket volumes, that one may read in\r\n  the fields, &c. In short, I would print it in a beautiful duodecimo as\r\n  du Hamel does; you have written enough already to make one such\r\n  volume, or nearly. However, there must be some new things in this\r\n  work; doubtless you have the plan of more tracts by you. If you read\r\n  French I would recommend a charming idea to you in this enclosing age,\r\n  namely a little 12mo. called \"L’amélioration des Terres,\" by Patulle.\r\n  In that work are plans, and also the manner of throwing a square tract\r\n  of ground of three or four hundred acres, &c., into an ornamented\r\n  farm, or, as the French call it, _ferme ornée_: the house and\r\n  buildings in the centre; the fields are square, the hedges quick set,\r\n  and the owner may command with his eye, and almost with his voice,\r\n  everybody and thing he is concerned with. If you cannot get the book\r\n  (though you certainly may at Vaillant’s) I will send you mine.\r\n\r\n              ‘Adieu, dear Sir,\r\n                         ‘Your most affectionate and obliged friend,\r\n                                                   ‘WALTER HARTE.’\r\n\r\n                                ‘Barton Street, Bath: Oct. 16, 1766.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—My wretched state of health must be my just excuse for\r\n  being so bad a correspondent.

You gave me some hopes that my\r\n  ever honoured friend at Worcester should convey to me, from you, some\r\n  manuscript dissertations on agriculture, but I have been so unhappy as\r\n  to know no more of them than of the lost books of Livy. In the course\r\n  of the winter you will see an octavo volume of religious poems\r\n  intituled the “Amaranth,” adorned with very fine sculptures from the\r\n  designs of the greatest masters, and executed by an artist of my own\r\n  forming, who never appeared before in a public capacity, except on my\r\n  Essays on Husbandry.

Till my work appeared nothing of that husbandry was\r\nknown beyond the county. The publication excited great interest, and\r\nbecame unquestionably the origin of many and great improvements in\r\nvarious parts of the kingdom. I scarcely went into any company in which\r\nit was not mentioned. Had I better understood the art of husbandry it\r\nmight, perhaps, have been well for me. Finding that a mixture of\r\nfamilies was inconsistent with comfortable living, I determined to quit\r\nBradfield, and advertised in the London papers for such a house and farm\r\nas would suit my views and fortune, that is to say, one thousand pounds\r\nwhich I received with my wife, the remainder being settled upon her. I\r\nfixed upon a very fine farm in Essex called Samford Hall; there I worked\r\nwith incredible avidity both in the agricultural and literary\r\ndepartment. I remember once to have written a quire of foolscap in one\r\nday! The work was entitled ‘Political Essays on the Present State of the\r\nBritish Empire.’\r\n\r\nAnd here I may mention a singular instance of animal sagacity. The\r\ngentleman who gave up the house to me was a Mr. Farquharson. His wife\r\nhad a favourite cat which, upon their removal, was put into a sack and\r\ncarried away with the furniture from Essex to Yatesby Bridge in\r\nHampshire. I was surprised in about five or six days to see poor puss\r\nagain at Samford Hall; nearly at the same time a letter was received\r\nfrom Mrs. Farquharson lamenting her loss, but doubting the possibility\r\nof the cat having returned to its original home. The circumstance is\r\nastonishing, and shows an instinct almost incredible, for the animal\r\nmust have travelled seventy miles and threaded the Metropolis.\r\n\r\nMy landlord, a Mr. Lamb, was a King’s messenger. He had formerly been, I\r\nbelieve, butler or _valet de chambre_ to the Duke of Leeds, and gave me\r\nmany accounts of the journeys he had made to Petersburg, Constantinople,\r\nNaples, &c., profiting by every journey very considerably, as he\r\nexpended much less in travelling than was allowed by Government. I write\r\nfrom memory, but I think he said that a journey to Petersburg or\r\nConstantinople paid him a neat profit of a hundred guineas.\r\n\r\nThis speculation turned out a bitter disappointment. I trusted to the\r\npromise of a relative to lend me some money, making, with what I\r\npossessed, sufficient for the undertaking. But he was himself\r\ndisappointed of the money, and I clearly foresaw that an insufficient\r\ncapital would infallibly cramp me in such a manner as to render all my\r\nefforts very uncomfortable and perhaps vain. I determined to make a\r\nshort cut and get rid of it immediately, which I did at the end of six\r\nmonths at no further loss than of 100_l._ This was a lesson of some use\r\nto me at subsequent periods of my life, and taught me early to\r\ndistinguish between certainty and probabilities.\r\n\r\n                       _Arthur Young to his Wife_\r\n\r\n                                                 ‘Tuesday: 1767.[38]\r\n\r\n  ‘My Dearest,—I am much in hopes I shall have a letter from you\r\n  to-morrow; if I have not it will be a great disappointment; for when\r\n  you don’t write in huffs your letters are my only comfort.

The most miserable circumstance of all is the being in such\r\n  suspense and anxiety. It absolutely stupefies me, and I am forced to\r\n  pin myself down to writing without the soul for anything but mere\r\n  copying. I would give my right hand that I had never seen this place,\r\n  but such reflections only make one the more miserable; and the\r\n  thoughts at the same time of what you feel with a young child to\r\n  suckle hurt me more than I can express in a word; we shall both be\r\n  capitally miserable till we are fixed somewhere on a certainty, and\r\n  when that will be Heaven knows. I had infinitely rather live in a\r\n  cottage upon bread and cheese than drag on the anxious existence I do\r\n  at present. Whichever way I turn my thoughts I see no remedy, nor know\r\n  who can advise me what step to take. I know not which is best myself,\r\n  I am sure, for everyone depends so on contingencies that sagacity\r\n  itself cannot foresee the consequences of all. An ill star rose on my\r\n  nativity; had I never been born it would have been just so much the\r\n  better for me, for you, and our wretched children.

If such things\r\n  as you speak of are to be had every day, why are North Country farmers\r\n  so poor? Here we give from ten to fifteen shillings per acre for lands\r\n  not a whit better than you can have in the North for a penny. We get\r\n  estates and live like gentlemen; North Country farmers are poor and\r\n  live worse than our labourers. These are allowed truths, but utterly\r\n  irreconcilable to the small share of reason I possess. All our good\r\n  farmers can lay up from one to two years’ rent of their farms in\r\n  common years, after paying the landlord, the parson, the poor,\r\n  servants’ wages, &c. &c. Were the North Country farms in the least\r\n  comparable should not we hear of it? Would not some of us get farther\r\n  from the capital for the sake of profit? Our mercantile people ramble\r\n  all over the world for gain, so would the farmer could he find it; and\r\n  any distance would be agreeable. There must, I think, be something in\r\n  the distant counties’ prices which counterbalances the cheapness of\r\n  the land and labour. I heartily wish you success and comfort in all\r\n  your undertakings, and that Bradmore Farm may produce corn, wine, and\r\n  oil in abundance.\r\n\r\n  ‘Mrs. Yeldham joins in compliments to you and Mrs. Young.\r\n\r\n                                   ‘I remain, dear Sir, &c. &c.,\r\n                                                     ‘JOHN YELDHAM.’\r\n\r\nMy correspondence with Mr. Harte continued. It gave me pain to find that\r\nhis health greatly declined. He was a cripple at Bath, but the disorders\r\nof his body seemed little to affect the vigour of his mind. He spoke\r\nvery flatteringly of the reception of my ‘Farmer’s Letters.’ ‘I am\r\namazed,’ he writes, ‘that you have so soon and so easily acquired the\r\nhardest point in all writing—namely, perspicuity and ease of style.’ And\r\nelsewhere, ‘Your letter addressed to my Lord Clive on an experimental\r\nfarm is new, spirited and pleasing, but I fear he has not a spark of the\r\n_divina aura_ in him. I have shown your pamphlet to the best judge in\r\nEngland, my Lord Chesterfield, who is now here. He likes it extremely,\r\nand vows if he was young and rich enough he would carry your scheme into\r\nexecution.’\r\n\r\nFrom Samford Hall I moved, in 1768, to another farm at North Mimms, in\r\nHertfordshire. I had scarcely settled here before my bookseller united\r\nwith many correspondents in urging me to take another tour. I\r\naccordingly travelled through the north of England, registering so many\r\nobservations, and noting the experiments of such a number of gentlemen,\r\nthat the record of the whole, with the necessary remarks, filled four\r\noctavo volumes, and enabled me to present the public with interesting\r\nagricultural details never before published. I may assert this without\r\nvanity, because the real merit belonged to those who furnished me with\r\nthe information; and the success of the work was so great that the first\r\nedition was sold almost as soon as it appeared. In the ‘Six Weeks’ Tour’\r\nI visited but few gentlemen, and consequently witnessed but few\r\nexperiments. On the ‘Northern Journey’ the case was very different, and\r\nthe number of trials reported on a variety of soils were great and\r\ninteresting. I spent some time with my friend, Mr. Ellerton, of Risby,\r\nin the East Riding; he accompanied me to York races and on a visit of\r\nseveral days to the Marquis of Rockingham, who had previously to the\r\njourney invited me to see him, and pointed out a number of persons\r\nproper for me to visit. Amongst the company at Wentworth was Mr. Danby,\r\nof Swinton, and his daughter,[39] then in the full blaze of her beauty.\r\nMy Lord Rockingham overheard her speaking to me and using the expression\r\n‘amazingly fine turnips.’ ‘So, so, Mr. Young,’ said his lordship, ‘you\r\nare getting farming intelligence of Miss Danby; the lady must let us\r\nhear more of those fine turnips.’[40] His lordship ordered me into an\r\napartment, in a closet of which was a considerable collection of ancient\r\nand curious books on agriculture, which he pointed out for my amusement\r\nwhen I had time to consult them. There was one circumstance which seemed\r\nvery awkward to me at Wentworth, the necessity of every person always\r\nhaving his hat under his arm, a hint of which Lord R. gave me on my\r\narrival, and I saw the want of it in one or two new comers, who, when\r\nthe horses were brought to the door, had a journey to make through the\r\nhouse before they could find their hats. From Wentworth I went to the\r\nDuke of Portland’s and others, and afterwards examined a great part of\r\nthe county of York with much attention, everywhere being received in a\r\nvery flattering manner.\r\n\r\nThis year I made many visits to my friend, Dr. Burney, in Poland Street,\r\nto whom my wife’s sister was married, and whose daughter Hester (by a\r\nformer marriage) entertained, or rather, fascinated me, by her\r\nperformance on the harpsichord and singing of Italian airs. I was never\r\ntired of listening to the ‘Ah, quelli occhi ladroncelli,’ and ‘Alla\r\nlarga,’ of Piccini,[41] and it is marvellous to me now to recollect that\r\nI was thus riveted to her side for six hours together.\r\n\r\nDuring this year my daughter Bessy was born, and the second edition of\r\nmy ‘Farmer’s Letters’ published.\r\n\r\n1769.—My son Arthur born. The whole of this year I passed at North\r\nMimms, very well received and visited in that thronged neighbourhood.\r\nThe Duke of Leeds, who lived in the parish, condescended to make\r\novertures with a view to my acquaintance. Sir Charles Cocks, afterwards\r\nLord Somers, if I do not mistake the year, did the same, and often drank\r\ntea with me; also Dr. Roper and his wife Lady Harriet. He was a man of\r\ngreat learning, and she a most amiable woman, free from all pride and\r\naffectation. I also often met Lady Mary Mordaunt at two or three houses,\r\nand her sister Lady Frances Bulhely, with whom she lived; with the\r\nformer I had something of a flirtation and lent her many books; she was\r\nrather handsome and very agreeable. I was elected member of a dining\r\nclub at Hatfield, and became acquainted with Samuel Whitbread, Esq.\r\nM.P.,[42] and Mr. Justice Willes from East Barnet. I was very well\r\nreceived by Mrs. Willes, a fine lady, and rather fantastical. They were\r\nboth vain people, and I remember one day at dinner Judge Willes saying\r\nto his wife, ‘My dear, I think we are rather scant in servants’—yet\r\nthere was one to every chair and some to spare. She was making an\r\nornamental path round the homestead, and asked my advice in several\r\ndifficulties. During this year Prince Massalski, Bishop of Wilna, wrote\r\nme a long French letter on the agricultural prosperity of England. He\r\nafterwards passed two days with me in Hertfordshire, an agreeable,\r\nwell-instructed man, who much lamented the miserable state of his own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n1770.—What a year of incessant activity, composition, anxiety and\r\nwretchedness was this! No carthorse ever laboured as I did at this\r\nperiod, spending like an idiot, always in debt, in spite of what I\r\nearned[43] with the sweat of my brow and almost my heart’s blood, such\r\nwas my anxiety; yet all was clearly vexation of spirit. Well might my\r\ndear mother write to me as she did. I trusted in an unparalleled\r\nindustry, but not in God; and see how He brought it all to nought, as if\r\nto convince me of my supreme folly and infatuation. My old Suffolk\r\nbailiff was the channel through which I ran into debt to the Bury banker\r\nby a series of drawing bills, one to pay another, till the plan became\r\nso obvious that he cut short and refused to accept any more. I had run\r\nnear a thousand pounds into his debt, and it was necessary for me to go\r\nover directly to Bury to see what could be done to pacify him. He was at\r\nhis country seat at Trosston. Thither I followed him, and, with great\r\ndifficulty, persuaded him to have patience, under a promise that I would\r\nmake arrangements to pay him very speedily. This I did with difficulty,\r\nand I scarcely recollect how. I shall, in the first place, note that the\r\nEastern Tour was accomplished, the journal of which was afterwards\r\npublished in four volumes. In the preface I returned thanks to those who\r\ncontributed to my information, and in the number were many most\r\ndistinguished personages amongst the nobility and gentry in the counties\r\nthrough which I travelled, with numerous distinguished farmers.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary here to pause a little in order to examine the object\r\nand the effect of the three tours I made and published. They have, by\r\nthe very best judges, been esteemed highly useful to practical\r\nagriculturists, and unquestionably they are equally so for the\r\ninformation they afford in political economy: they have accordingly, in\r\nthese views, been celebrated[44] in almost every language of Europe.\r\nWhen a work appears, the object and execution of which are equally novel\r\nand unexampled, it is not surprising that a certain measure of success\r\nshould attend such a work. Nothing in the least similar to it had before\r\nappeared in the English language; for though there had been a tour of\r\nGreat Britain, and other tours through great part of the kingdom, yet\r\nall these works agreed in one circumstance—that of the authors confining\r\ntheir attention absolutely to towns and seats, without paying any more\r\nthought to agriculture than if that art had no existence between the\r\ntowns they visited. Indeed my work was admitted on all hands to be\r\nperfectly original. In regard to the practical husbandry of the farmers,\r\nand the experimental observations of the gentlemen I visited, the\r\nutility of these could not be doubted. When a Lord Chancellor of\r\nEngland, amusing himself with husbandry, read the English works on that\r\nsubject for information, and burnt them as affording him nothing but\r\ncontradictions, without doubt he complained that these writers did not\r\ndescribe the common management of the farmers, and on that management\r\nfounding their propositions of improvement. But the fact was, and it\r\nmust be, in the nature of things, writers confined to their closets, or,\r\nat most, to a single farm, could not describe what it was impossible for\r\nthem to know; and before the appearance of my tours there was scarcely a\r\ndistrict in the kingdom described in such a manner as to convince the\r\nreader that the authors had any practical knowledge of the art; for a\r\nman to quit his farm and his fireside in order to examine the husbandry\r\nof a kingdom by travelling above four thousand miles through a country\r\nof no greater extent than England was certainly taking means\r\nsufficiently effective for laying a sure basis for the future\r\nimprovement of the soil. To understand well the present state of\r\ncultivation is surely a necessary step prior to proposals of\r\nimprovement. This I effected; and in the opinion of some very able\r\nagriculturists now living, the greatest of the subsequent improvements\r\nthat have been made during the last forty years have, in a great\r\nmeasure, originated in the defects pointed out by me in the detail of\r\nthese journeys.\r\n\r\nI shall venture to insert one anecdote which occurred in the Northern\r\nTour. At Mr. Danby’s, at Swinton in Yorkshire, I met a very uncommon\r\ninstance of extraordinary industry in a collier, who improved some waste\r\nmoors by the labour of his own hands beside his common hours of working\r\nin the colliery. He had so animated a spirit of improvement that I\r\nthought it a great pity that he should be left without better support;\r\nand therefore I proposed a subscription for him, which raised in all\r\nabout 100_l._, and Mr. Danby, his landlord, releasing him from his\r\ncolliery, he was enabled to extend his improvements with much more\r\ncomfort to himself. After a few years he died, leaving his farm for the\r\nbenefit of his family. He shortened his life, poor fellow, by his\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThis year I was obliged to decline an invitation from Lord Holdernesse\r\nto accompany him to Hornby Castle. Upon informing my mother of the\r\nrefusal, she, with her ever watchful kindness concerning my interests,\r\nwrote thus: ‘I am extremely sorry that you refused Lord Holdernesse’s\r\ninvitation; it was an opportunity you may never have again, for when\r\nfavours that great people offer are refused, they seldom, if ever, make\r\na second; it is very extraordinary indeed if they do. He is as likely to\r\nbe one in the Administration as any other, for since Lady H. is one of\r\nthe Ladies of the Queen’s Bedchamber it is not likely that he [Lord H.]\r\nwill be long out of post; and who knows? you might have found favour in\r\nhis sight. I fear as long as my poor eyes are open I shall never want\r\nfor something relating to your welfare to vex me extremely, which I must\r\nown is a great weakness. As to the regard of this world, thank God I do\r\noften reflect on the shortness of every earthly felicity, a misery\r\ncompared with the duration of hereafter, and I am fully convinced that\r\non God all events depend. I can’t help transcribing a few lines out of a\r\nbook you know little of. [_Here follow scriptural texts._] Thank God, I\r\ndon’t owe five pounds in the world, not that I brag of being free from\r\ndebt as owing to any merit to me, for I am far from thinking anything\r\nlike it; no, it is to the mercy and goodness of God who has given me a\r\ncomfortable provision for the situation I am in, and in a better I don’t\r\ndesire to be, for a little with God’s blessing goes much farther than a\r\ngreat deal without it. You may call all this rubbish if you please, but\r\na time will come when you will be convinced whose notions are rubbish,\r\nyours or mine.’ I here insert another letter from my mother, at the risk\r\nof being taxed with personal vanity:—\r\n\r\n‘I had a letter yesterday from your brother, in which was a paragraph\r\nthat I think will give you a little pleasure. It is as follows: \"I find\r\nthat Arthur has printed lately a pamphlet on the ‘Exportation of Corn.’\r\nA gentleman who came from the Drawing Room yesterday told me that the\r\nKing asked him whether he had read Mr. Young’s pamphlet on the subject,\r\nand commended it.\" Oh, dear! how pleasing it is to have the approbation\r\nof a King, even though we never get sixpence by it. And yet how few are\r\ndesirous of the approbation of the King; yet they may be sure of it if\r\nthey sincerely try, and can never fail of being well rewarded, both in\r\nthis world and the next. Oh! Arthur, with what capacities are you\r\nendowed—with what advantages for being greatly good! But with the\r\ntalents of an angel a man may be a fool if he judges amiss on the\r\nsupreme point.’\r\n\r\n1771.[45]—The same unremitting industry, the same anxiety, the same vain\r\nhopes, the same perpetual disappointment. No happiness, nor anything\r\nlike it.\r\n\r\nThis year I published the third edition of the ‘Farmer’s Letters,’ the\r\nsecond edition of the ‘Northern Tour,’ the ‘Farmer’s Calendar,’ my\r\n‘Proposals for Numbering the People’—the occasion of which was the Earl\r\nof Chatham’s words: ‘When I compare the number of our people—estimated\r\nhighly at seven[46] millions—with the population of France and Spain,\r\nusually computed at twenty-five millions, I see a clear, self-evident\r\npossibility for this country to contend with the united powers of the\r\nHouse of Bourbon merely upon the strength of its own resources.’ I\r\nconceived that to draw such political principles for the national\r\nconduct from a mere supposition of population was a doctrine tending to\r\nvery mischievous errors. I therefore was convinced that an actual\r\nenumeration of the people ought to take place. Nothing, however, was\r\ndone at the time, but thirty years afterwards[47] the Legislature was of\r\nthe same opinion, and not till then were the numbers ascertained.\r\n\r\nThis year I began my correspondence with Mr. John Baker Holroyd,[48]\r\nafterwards so well known for his literary productions as Lord Sheffield.\r\nIn his first letter, dated March 1771, he mentions his wish that I\r\nshould forward some cabbage seed, and hopes that I may be the means of\r\nintroducing the culture of cabbages into that neighbourhood (Sussex),\r\nbut adds—what must now appear singular—that the very extraordinary\r\nscarcity of hands cramps him very much. ‘All the lively, able young men\r\nare employed in smuggling. They can have a guinea a week as riders and\r\ncarriers without any risk; therefore it is not to be expected that they\r\nwill labour for eight shillings a week until some more effectual means\r\nare taken to prevent smuggling.’\r\n\r\nI had also a letter from the deservedly celebrated philanthropist, John\r\nHoward, with a basket of his American potatoes, afterwards known under\r\nthe name of ‘the Howard and cluster potatoes.’ He added: ‘Permit me,\r\nsir, to offer my thanks for the entertainment of your very ingenious and\r\nuseful labours, and the honour you did me in the mention of my name.’\r\n\r\n1772.—Published ‘Political Essays on the British Empire,’ ‘Present State\r\nof Waste Lands.’ A third edition of the ‘Six Weeks’ Tour’ was also\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nThis year I attended very much the meetings of the Society for the\r\nEncouragement of Arts,[49] Manufactures and Commerce, as well as the\r\nCommittee of Agriculture,[50] of which I was Chairman. In a letter from\r\nMr. Butterworth Bayley, he lamented the want of a respectable\r\npublication by the Society of Arts, and called on me to think of some\r\nmeans of remedying the misery (_sic_). When I became Chairman of the\r\nCommittee of Agriculture, I was the first to propose that annual\r\npublication which afterwards took place. This proposition was at once\r\nacceded to, and Valentine Green, the engraver, had the impudence to\r\nassert that it originated with him.\r\n\r\nThis year I visited Samuel Whitbread, Esq., at Cardington, in\r\nBedfordshire, and as Mr. Howard, who afterwards became so celebrated for\r\nhis philanthropy, lived in the same parish, Mr. W. took me to call upon\r\nhim one morning. He was esteemed a singular character, but was at that\r\ntime quite unknown in the world. He was then only famous for introducing\r\na new series of potatoes into cultivation. We found him in a parlour,\r\nwithout books or apparently any employment, dressed as for an evening in\r\nLondon—a powdered bag wig, white silk stockings, thin shoes, and every\r\nother circumstance of his habiliments excluding the possibility of a\r\ncountry walk. He was rather pragmatical in his speech, very polite, but\r\nexpressing himself in a manner that seemed to belong to two hundred\r\nyears ago. I asked Mr. Whitbread if Mr. Howard was usually thus dressed\r\nand confined to his room, for he was as intimate with Whitbread as with\r\nanybody. He had never seen him otherwise, he said, but added that he was\r\na sensible man and a very worthy one.\r\n\r\nAt this time I published my ‘Political Essays on the Present State of\r\nAffairs in the British Empire,’ also the third edition of the ‘Six\r\nWeeks’ Tour.’ Comber’s ‘Real Improvements in Agriculture on the\r\nPrinciples of A. Young, Esq.,’ was likewise printed. Comber was\r\nafterwards deeply engaged in the ‘Monthly Review,’ and belaboured me\r\nwith all the abuse he could accumulate. I published also a tract\r\nentitled ‘The Present State of Waste Lands in Great Britain.’\r\n\r\nIn March, Mr. Allen, my wife’s brother, an alderman of Lynn, applied to\r\nthe Earl of Orford to procure for me an establishment in some public\r\noffice, and his Lordship wrote to Lord North on the subject. In his\r\nreply the latter spoke of me as one ‘whose very ingenious and useful\r\nwritings point out as a very proper object of notice and reward.’ It was\r\nan application for a King’s waiter’s[51] place, a sinecure.\r\n\r\nAt this time I was so distressed that I had serious thoughts of quitting\r\nthe kingdom[52] and going to America. Surely the three last years ought\r\nto have convinced me, had I not been worse than an idiot, of the vanity\r\nand folly of my expenses, and how utterly all comfort and happiness must\r\nfly such pursuits. Feeling a force and vigour of mind in myself\r\nerroneously, I trusted in them. As to God, I lived without Him in the\r\nworld, and had not a companion that could bring me to Him. But my\r\nmother, my ever dear mother, wrote in vain to me; her advice was not\r\nlistened to. She tried to bring me to a right sense of religion, which\r\nwould have conferred that peace and content which flew before my vain\r\npursuits.\r\n\r\nDr. Hunter,[53] of York, wrote to me this year on the Georgical Essays,\r\nand on carrots and their conversion into a confection for the use of\r\nseamen, of which he entertained great expectations. ‘I received much\r\npleasure,’ he wrote, ‘from the perusal of your Eastern Tour, and could\r\nnot help expressing uneasiness at the rancorous treatment of the monthly\r\nreviewers. We are all open to fair and candid criticism, but when there\r\nis the least spark of resentment seen it then ceases to be criticism,\r\nand deserves another name. I propose to finish the Georgical Essays,\r\nwith two more volumes, in 1773. My own natural avocations will not\r\npermit me in future to be anything but an editor; I wish I had leisure\r\nto prosecute so agreeable a study. I have, however, some satisfaction in\r\nseeing the art (of agriculture) improve under your hands, and hope that\r\nnothing will prevail upon you to withdraw yourself from the public. I\r\nhave, this year, a large experiment with onions and carrots. These\r\nvegetables have not hitherto been cultivated in the field in this\r\ncountry. Besides the application of carrots for horses and hogs, I am\r\npersuaded that they may be converted by a cheap process into a\r\nconfection for the use of seamen. This, and the last year’s experiments,\r\nconvince me of the practicability of the scheme, and next year I propose\r\nto ship a considerable quantity for the above purpose. The expense is\r\nsmall, and my expectations are great.’\r\n\r\n1773.—Here began a new career of industry, ill-exerted, of new hopes and\r\nnever-failing disappointments, labour and sorrow, folly and infatuation,\r\nwhich it is scarcely possible for a man, turned into the world without\r\nbusiness or profession, to escape, and it affords a most impressive\r\nlesson to all parents to be almost as ready to hang their children as to\r\nbring them up without a regular profession. If I had been a country\r\ncurate with 50_l._ a year, in addition to the income I possessed, and\r\nhad lived in a quiet parsonage, the probability of happiness would have\r\nbeen far greater. The business of my farm at North Mimms was\r\ninsufficient to keep me employed, and the intercourse I constantly had\r\nwith London I considered as a means which should be turned to some\r\naccount in the increase of a most insufficient income; in fact, I was in\r\na most uncomfortable state, which induced me to listen to the proposals\r\nof a gentleman I met with—I have quite forgotten whom—who informed me\r\nthat the ‘Morning Post’ proprietors were in great want of some person to\r\nreport the debates in Parliament. In consequence of this information I\r\napplied at their office, and they very readily engaged me for a trial,\r\nto see if I was able to perform the business they required. This was\r\ndone, and as they were well satisfied with the manner in which the work\r\nwas executed, I continued it at a salary, as well as I can recollect, of\r\nfive guineas a week. Every Saturday I walked seventeen miles to my farm,\r\nand back again on the Monday morning. This year I published my\r\nobservations on the present state of waste lands, which contained a new\r\nidea of extreme importance in the mode of working any great and\r\neffective improvement. In most of the attempts that have been made by\r\nindividuals to accomplish these meritorious works, there generally\r\nappeared a weakness of effort and insufficiency of means, which\r\nprevented anything considerable being effected, and the cause I justly\r\nexplained to be, a want of proportion between the means and the end, not\r\nso much in a want of money as in a most erroneous method of applying it.\r\nTo raise a set of buildings for a farm, with gradual additions to the\r\nwhole, and enclosing from the waste, field after field for improvement,\r\nwith views merely of forming a large farm, and keeping the whole in\r\nhand, demands so large a capital that the succeeding languor of the\r\nexertions has been evidently owing to want of money, the capital being\r\ninsufficient for the two distinct objects of farming and improving. The\r\nnovel idea struck me that the whole capital in such cases should be\r\nappropriated to improvements alone; that no other buildings should be\r\nraised than exactly sufficient for such a small farm as lets most\r\nreadily in the district—and this, usually, is little more than a\r\ncottage, and ten or twenty acres of grass round it. Hence I proposed\r\nthat an entire new farm should, after one course of crops, be formed,\r\nand let, sold, or mortgaged every year. In this mode of proceeding the\r\nfarming would be entirely subservient to the improvement, and the\r\ncapital would be constantly moving to fresh land. I showed that a small\r\nsum of money, thus employed, would gradually improve a great and\r\nincreasing breadth of waste; whereas, if the same money was employed in\r\nthe common manner of farming and occupying a larger farm, the space\r\nimproved, after fifteen or twenty years, would be trifling, and the\r\nprofit very inferior. My explanation of this system carries conviction\r\nwith it; but the work appearing at a period when the rapidity of my\r\npublications satiated the world, little or no attention was paid to it.\r\n\r\n1774.—I, this year, published on my own account my political arithmetic,\r\none of my best works, which was immediately translated into many\r\nlanguages, and highly commended in many parts of Europe. Judges of the\r\nsubject here, as well as abroad, have considered it as abounding in\r\nvaluable information and the justest views; but, unfortunately, as in\r\nthe case of my work on waste lands, it followed so many other of my\r\npublications that little attention was paid to it, except by the _few_\r\nwho saw the importance of the subject, or who were able to judge of the\r\nmerit of the work.\r\n\r\nThe winter was passed in London in the same employment as the preceding;\r\nbut I had become known to so many men of science that several hinted to\r\nme the propriety of my being a candidate for election as a Fellow of the\r\nRoyal Society, and my recommendation as such being garnished with some\r\nrespectable names I was accordingly elected, which adds the F.R.S. to my\r\nname. Once in conversation with Dr. Burney on these elections, he said,\r\n‘No matter, for that we have got our _ends_ of them.’ This year I was\r\nelected an honorary member of the Palatine Society of Agriculture\r\nestablished at Mannheim, also of the Geographical Society of Florence.\r\n\r\n1775.—This winter I spent in London. From 1766 to 1775 being ten years,\r\nI received 3,000_l._, or 300_l._ a year.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  ‘We were married more than two years.’ [Note by A.

What would not a sensible, quiet, prudent wife have done for me?\r\nBut had I so behaved to God as to merit such a gift?\r\n\r\nThe only pleasant moments that I passed were in visits to my friend\r\nArbuthnot[54] at Mitcham, whose agriculture so near the capital brought\r\ngood company to his house. He was upon the whole the most agreeable,\r\npleasant and interesting connection which I ever made in agricultural\r\npursuits. He was brother of the present Rt. Honorable.\r\n\r\nI had in 1775 determined on making the tour of Ireland, to which the\r\nEarl of Shelburne[55] much instigated me, and I corresponded with\r\nseveral persons on the subject, who urged me much to that undertaking,\r\nbut I was obliged to postpone it to the following year. The following is\r\na note from Mr. Burke on the subject:—\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Burke sends the covers with his best compliments and wishes to Mr.\r\nYoung. He would be very glad to give Mr. Young recommendations to\r\nIreland, but his acquaintance there is almost worn out, Lord Charlemont\r\nand one or two more being all that he thinks care a farthing for him.\r\nHowever, if letters to them would be of any service to Mr. Young, Mr. B.\r\nwould with great pleasure write them.’\r\n\r\nOn June 19 of this year 1776 I embarked at Holyhead for Ireland, and in\r\nconsequence of this journey through every part of the kingdom, produced\r\nin 1780 that tour which succeeded so well, and has been reckoned among\r\nmy best and most useful productions; and I have reason to believe had\r\nconsiderable effect in enlightening the people of that country. I took\r\nwith me many letters of introduction, from the Earl of Shelburne, Mr.\r\nBurke, and other persons of eminence in England; and on landing at\r\nDublin, was immediately introduced to Colonel Burton, afterwards Lord\r\nCunningham, aide-de-camp to the Earl of Harcourt, at that time Lord\r\nLieutenant, and well known to the whole kingdom. Colonel Burton, to whom\r\nI was more indebted for letters of introduction than to any other man in\r\nEngland, was a most remarkable character. He had great care and elegance\r\nunited with a measure of roughness, which may be attributed to a sort of\r\npersonal courage which was apt to boil over. This led him into many\r\nquarrels, and not a few duels, one of which was fought across a table of\r\nno great length from end to end, and, not strange to tell of in Ireland,\r\nseveral of the party stood near enjoying the sport. He was a true friend\r\nto the interests of Ireland, and far more enlightened upon it than the\r\ngreater part of well-informed people to be found there. He made immense\r\nexertions to improve the fisheries on his estate at Donegal, but they\r\nwere unsuccessful. He was respectable[56] for general knowledge, and\r\npossessed a great flow of animated conversation. He carried me to Lord\r\nHarcourt’s villa at St. Woolstans, with whom I spent some days; and the\r\nColonel arranged the plan of my journey, giving me a multitude of\r\nletters to those who were best able to afford valuable information. I\r\nkept a private journal throughout the whole of this tour, in which I\r\nminuted many anecdotes and circumstances which occurred to me of a\r\nprivate nature, descriptive of the manners of the people, which, had it\r\nbeen preserved, would have assisted greatly in drawing up these papers;\r\nbut, unfortunately, it was lost, with all the specimens of soils and\r\nminerals which I collected throughout the whole kingdom. On returning to\r\nEngland, I quitted my whisky[57] at Bath, and got into a stage, and sent\r\na new London servant, the only one I had, thither to bring the horse and\r\nchaise to London, and the trunk containing these things. The fellow was\r\na rascal, stole the trunk, and pretended that he had lost it on the\r\nroad; in addition to the loss was the torment of hunting him out (for he\r\nwent away directly) through London for punishment. With great difficulty\r\nI found him, and serving a warrant upon him, carried him to Bow Street,\r\nwhere Fielding the magistrate at once dismissed the complaint, it being\r\nonly a breach of trust, as the robbery could not be proved; and all I\r\ngot for my pains was abuse from the fellow.\r\n\r\nThis was a very great loss to me, as the specimens I brought of soils\r\nwould have been of great use to me in the course of experiments which I\r\nsoon after began in the object of expelling gases from earths. In my\r\njourney through Ireland I was received with great hospitality, which\r\ncharacterises the nation, and with that particular attention which my\r\npeculiar object excited in so many persons who rendered agriculture\r\neither their profit or amusement.\r\n\r\nI travelled four hundred miles _de suite_ without going to an inn.\r\nAmongst those who were most desirous of my calling upon them was Sir\r\nJames Caldwell, of Castle Caldwell, on Lough Erne. One anecdote will\r\ngive some idea of his character.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Lansdowne, then Earl of Shelburne, being in Ireland, and\r\nintending to call on Sir James, he, with an hospitality truly Irish,\r\nthought of nothing night or day but how to devise some amusement to\r\nentertain his noble guest, and came home to breakfast one morning with\r\nprodigious eagerness to communicate a new idea to Lady Caldwell. This\r\nwas to summon together the hundred labourers he employed, and choose\r\nfifty that, would best represent New Zealand savages, in order that he\r\nmight form two fleets of boats on the Lough, one to represent Captain\r\nCook and his men, the other a New Zealand chief at the head of his party\r\nin canoes, and consulted her how it would be possible to get them\r\ndressed in an appropriate manner in time for Lord Shelburne’s arrival.\r\nLady C., who had much more prudence than Sir James, reminded him that he\r\nhad 200 acres of hay down, and the preparations he mentioned would\r\noccupy so much time that the whole would now stand a chance of being\r\nspoiled. All remonstrances were in vain. Tailors were pressed into his\r\nservice from the surrounding country to vamp up, as well as time would\r\npermit, the crews of men and fleets. The prediction was fulfilled: the\r\nhay was spoiled, and what hurt Sir James much more, he received a letter\r\nfrom Lord S. to put off his coming till his return from Kilkenny, and\r\nthat uncertain. To add to the mortification, after some weeks, Sir James\r\nbeing on business at Dublin, Lord S. arrived without giving notice, and\r\nLady C., not presuming to exhibit the intended battle, but wishing to\r\namuse his Lordship as well as the place would afford, told him at\r\nbreakfast that the morning should be spent in fishing. Lord S. replied,\r\n‘My dear Lady C., you look upon a fine lake out of your windows; but I\r\nhave often remarked—from the ocean to the pond—that where at the first\r\nblush you have reason to expect most fish you are sure to find least.’\r\nThis made Lady C. exert herself—boats, nets, and all were collected, and\r\nthey caught such an immensity as really proved a most gratifying\r\nspectacle to his Lordship, who confessed that his maxim failed him for\r\nonce. His stay was too short for Sir James’s return.\r\n\r\nAt Lord Longford’s I met a person of some celebrity at the time for\r\nadventures not worth reciting, Mr. Medlicott. Lord L. and he gave me an\r\naccount of a gentleman of a good estate in that neighbourhood, but then\r\ndead, whose real life, manners and conversation far exceeded anything to\r\nbe met with in ‘Castle Rackrent.’ His hospitality was unbounded, and it\r\nnever for a moment came into his head to make any provision for feeding\r\nthe people he brought into his house. While credit was to be had, his\r\nbutler or housekeeper did this for him; his own attention was given\r\nsolely to the cellar that wine might not be wanted. If claret was\r\nsecured, with a dead ox or sheep hanging in the slaughter-house ready\r\nfor steaks or cutlets, he thought all was well. He was never easy\r\nwithout company in the house, and with a large party in it would invite\r\nanother of twice the number. One day the cook came into the breakfast\r\nparlour before all the company: ‘Sir, there’s no coals.’ ‘Then burn\r\nturf.’ ‘Sir, there’s no turf.’ ‘Then cut down a tree.’ This was a\r\nforlorn hope, for in all probability he must have gone three miles to\r\nfind one, all round the house being long ago safely swept away. They\r\ndispatched a number of cars to borrow turf. Candles were equally\r\ndeficient, for unfortunately he was fond of dogs all half starved, so\r\nthat a gentleman walking to what was called his bed-chamber, after\r\nmaking two or three turnings, met a hungry greyhound, who, jumping up,\r\ntook the candle out of the candlestick, and devoured it in a trice, and\r\nleft him in the dark. To advance or return was equally a matter of\r\nchance, therefore groping his way, he soon found himself in the midst of\r\na parcel of giggling maidservants. By what means he at last found his\r\nway to his ‘shakedown’ is unknown. A ‘shakedown’ when I was in Ireland\r\nmeant some clean straw spread upon the floor, with blankets and sheets,\r\nin what was called the barrack room, one containing several beds for\r\nsingle men.\r\n\r\nAt Mr. Richard Aldworth’s, in the county of Cork, I met with an\r\ninstance, both in that gentleman and lady, of elegant manners and\r\ncultivated minds. He had made the grand tour, and she had been educated\r\nin that style which may be imagined in a person nearly related to a Lord\r\nChief Justice and an Archbishop. But it was evident that patriotic\r\nmotives alone made them residents in Ireland. A sigh would often escape\r\nwhen circumstances of English manners were named, and they felt the\r\ndismal vacuity of living in a country where people of equal ideas were\r\nscarce. Mrs. Aldworth had in her possession one original manuscript\r\nletter of Dean Swift, entrusted to her under a solemn promise that she\r\nwould permit no copy to be taken, nor ever read it twice to the same\r\npeople. It was without exception the wittiest and severest satire upon\r\nIreland that probably ever was written, and it was easy to perceive by\r\nthe manner in which it was read that the sentiments were not a little in\r\nunison with those of the reader. This letter was equally hostile to the\r\nnobility, the gentry, the people, the country, nay the very rivers and\r\nmountains; for it declared the Shannon itself to be little better than a\r\nseries of marshes, that carried to the ocean less water than flows\r\nthrough one of the arches of London Bridge.\r\n\r\nFrom various other instances, as well as from this, I was inclined to\r\nthink that that degree of a polished and cultivated education, which\r\nsuits well enough for London or Paris, or a country residence in a good\r\nneighbourhood of England, was ill-framed for a province in Ireland.\r\nPersons of equal attainments may now and then come across them, but they\r\nare compelled to associate with so many who are the very reverse that a\r\nmore certain provision of misery can scarcely be laid.\r\n\r\nThe preceding observation is in a measure applicable to Mr. and Mrs.\r\nJefferys and Mr. and Mrs. Trant, who lived in the vicinity of Cork. The\r\ntwo former when I was there were actually embarking for France, after\r\ngreat speculations in building a town and establishing manufactures,\r\nwhich probably had proved too expensive. They were well informed and\r\ncultivated, and spoke most modern languages. Mr. Trant was an instance\r\nof a singularly retentive memory. It was never necessary for him to\r\nconsult the same book twice. All that he ever read in a variety of\r\nlanguages was at his tongue’s end, and he applied these uncommon stores\r\nwith great judgment and propriety. The most beautiful description of\r\nKilkenny was written by him. It gave me pleasure to hear not long\r\nafterwards that Mr. and Mrs. Jefferys were at Paris but a few days, and\r\nthen returned to England. The motive of the journey was reported to be\r\nto get rid of a much too numerous establishment of servants, as they\r\nstarted again on a much more moderate and comfortable plan.\r\n\r\nAs a feature of Irish manners, I may mention another circumstance which\r\nastonished me. When upon my tour I spent a day or two with the Right\r\nHon. Silver Oliver, who had at that time much company in his house. The\r\ntable was well appointed, and everything wore an air of splendour and\r\naffluence. Afterwards when I resided at Mitchelstown—Mr. Oliver was\r\neither dead or absent, and everything in the house was advertised to be\r\nsold by auction—I went over to that auction, which gave me an\r\nopportunity of examining the whole house. I desired to be shown into the\r\nkitchen, as I could not find it of myself. When pointed out I was in\r\nutter amazement. There never was such a hole. I insisted upon it that it\r\ncould not be the kitchen, as I had myself partook of dinners which could\r\nnever have been dressed in such a pig-stye; but they assured me there\r\nwas no other. It was about eight feet wide and ten long. Scarcely any\r\nlight, and the walls black as the inside of the chimney. The furniture\r\nwas no better than the fitting up; dressers, tables, and shelves seemed\r\nto have been laid aside as superfluous luxuries. It must have been an\r\neffort of uncommon ingenuity to cook at a turf hearth, in such a cave as\r\nthis, the ample dinners I had seen in this house, and Etna or Vesuvius\r\nmight as soon have been found in England as such a kitchen. Its\r\nexistence for a single instant in the house of a man of fortune would be\r\na moral impossibility. No English farmer would submit to it for a week.\r\nThis strongly shows the manners of the people.\r\n\r\nA family with whom I resided for some time, while waiting for the\r\nWaterford packet, was that of Mr. Bolton, in a beautiful situation,\r\ncommanding the finest views. Mr. Bolton, the elder, was a respectable\r\nman; but his son, the present proprietor of the estate, then in\r\nParliament, was a man of singular and genuine patriotism, and of so mild\r\nand pleasing a temper that I much regretted I had him not for a\r\nneighbour at Bradfield. I had the pleasure of sending him from Suffolk\r\nmany implements &c. for assisting him in his improved husbandry; and he\r\nhas proved to the present day one of the most enlightened friends that\r\nIreland has to boast, making an equal figure in my tour, and in the very\r\nable work of Mr. Wakefield[58] published within an interval of thirty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAmong the persons who received me in the most agreeable and hospitable\r\nmanner I may be permitted to name the following: Earl of Harcourt (Lord\r\nLieutenant), Earl of Charlemont, Lord Chief Baron Forster, his Grace the\r\nLord Primate, the Archbishop of Tuam, Sir James Caldwell, &c.\r\n\r\n1777.—This was the first favourable turn that promised anything after\r\nten years’ anxiety and misery, yet how little did I deserve from that\r\nProvidence I had so long neglected. The year was a remarkable one in the\r\nevents of my life.\r\n\r\nMr. Danby, of whom mention has already been inserted, was this spring in\r\nLondon, and as Lord Kingsborough, son of the Earl of Kingston, was\r\nintimately acquainted with Mr. D., and at that time there also, his\r\nLordship often complained of the sad state of neglect in which his\r\nproperty remained in the hands of an Irish agent, who never saw an acre\r\nof the estate but merely on a rapid journey once, or at most twice, a\r\nyear to receive the rents. For this purpose a clerk resided at\r\nMitchelstown, having a summer house in the Castle garden for his office,\r\nand here the tenants came to pay their rents in a constant succession of\r\ndriblets the whole year round. His Lordship observed that it would be of\r\nmuch importance to him to have a respectable resident agent who\r\nunderstood agriculture, and might greatly contribute to the improvement\r\nof the property. Mr. Danby entirely coincided in this opinion, and told\r\nhis Lordship that he knew a gentleman who possessed the unquestionable\r\nknowledge and management of estates, and as he had known me for several\r\nyears he had every reason to believe in my integrity. He then named me.\r\nLord K. begged him to make the application to me immediately, which Mr.\r\nDanby did, and invited me to meet Lord and Lady K. to dinner. I had a\r\ngood deal of conversation with Lord K., and the next day Mr. Danby made\r\nan agreement with his Lordship for me to become his agent at an annual\r\nsalary of 500l., with an eligible house for my residence, rent free, and\r\na retaining fee, to be paid immediately, of 500l. more.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this arrangement, to which I readily agreed, I\r\ndisposed of the lease of my farm in Hertfordshire, and sent my books and\r\nother effects which I might want to Cork by sea, going myself to Dublin,\r\nwhere I resided some time in a constant round of Dublin dinners, till I\r\nwas informed by Lord Kingsborough that the house at Mitchelstown was\r\nready in which I was to reside, whilst a new one was building on a plan\r\nand in a situation approved of myself. In September I left Dublin for\r\nMitchelstown—130 miles off—making a detour through those counties which\r\nI had not sufficiently seen the preceding year. And here I cannot avoid\r\ninserting the following excellent advice from my ever affectionate\r\nmother: ‘My memory begins to fail me, but no wonder at 72. That is not\r\nthe cause of yours doing so, but the multiplicity of business you are\r\nengaged in. I attribute it also to being overburthened with your\r\naffairs. I can get neither ploughman nor footman to go over to Ireland,\r\nso you must see what you can do when you come yourself, which, I am\r\nsorry to hear, is not till (next) September. God only knows if I shall\r\nlive so long as to see you once more. However, to hear you are well and\r\nhappy is a great comfort to me, and the only one I have left, for it is\r\nmy lot to be deprived of all those who to me are dearest. I hate now to\r\ndo anything but sit by the fire and write to you.... But the happiness\r\nof this world, Arthur, is but of a short duration; I therefore wish you\r\nwould bestow some thoughts on that happiness which will have eternal\r\nduration.[59]\r\n\r\n1778.—The opening of this year found me at Mitchelstown, where Mrs.\r\nYoung joined me. On my arrival I busied myself incessantly in examining\r\nand valuing the farms which came out of lease, and was so occupied\r\nseveral months. I was most anxious to persuade Lord K. into the\r\npropriety of letting his lands to the occupying cottar as tenant, and\r\ndismissing the whole race of middlemen. I adhered steadily to this, and\r\nhad the satisfaction to find that Lord K. was well inclined to the plan.\r\nBut a distant relation of Lady K.’s, who had one farm upon the estate as\r\nmiddleman, Major Thornhill, feeling the sweets of a profit rent upon\r\nthat one farm, was exceedingly anxious to procure from Lord K. the\r\nprofits of others upon the same terms, and in this respect I was placed\r\nin an awkward situation. It was impossible for me, consistently with the\r\ninterest of Lord K., in any measure whatever to promote the success of\r\ndesigns which struck at the very root of all my plans, as the Major had\r\nhis eye upon several of the most considerable farms. Lady K. had a high\r\nopinion of the Major, who was a lively, pleasant, handsome man, and an\r\nignorant open-hearted duellist; she had of course favoured his plans,\r\nand I as carefully avoided ever saying anything in favour of them. Thus\r\nfrom the beginning it was not difficult to see an underground plot to\r\nfrustrate schemes commencing very early, but things in the meantime\r\ncarried a fair outward appearance. I dined very often at the Castle, and\r\ngenerally played at chess with Lady Kingsborough for an hour or more\r\nafter dinner, and I learned by report that her Ladyship was highly\r\npleased with me, saying that I was one of the most lively, agreeable\r\nfellows. Lord Kingsborough was of a character not so easily ascertained,\r\nfor at many different periods of his life he seemed to possess qualities\r\nvery much in contradiction to each other. His manner and carriage were\r\nremarkably easy, agreeable, and polite, having the finish of a perfect\r\ngentleman; he wanted, however, steadiness and perseverance even in his\r\nbest designs, and was easily wrought upon by persons of inferior\r\nabilities. Mrs. Thornhill, the wife of the Major, was an artful\r\ndesigning woman, ever on the watch to injure those who stood in her\r\nhusband’s way, and never forgetting her private interest for a moment. I\r\nsaw a fixed plan in her mind for dispossessing me of the agency and\r\nprocuring it for the Major, and I conceive it was by her\r\nmisrepresentations that a decisive use was made of an opportunity which\r\nsoon after offered for effecting her plan.\r\n\r\nLady K. had a Catholic governess, a Miss Crosby, relative to whom Mrs.\r\nT. had inspired Lady K. with sentiments of jealousy, insomuch that she\r\nwas discharged, and I was employed to draw up an engagement to grant her\r\nan annuity of 50_l._ per annum. This transaction and others connected\r\nwith it occasioned me to be much at the Castle, and in situations which\r\nwere converted by Mrs. Thornhill into proofs that I was in league with\r\nMiss C. for securing the affections of Lord Kingsborough at the expense\r\nof his wife, and, at the same time, it was carefully impressed into his\r\nLordship’s mind that I was in love with Lady K. Thus by a train of\r\nartful intrigues and deceptions the ladies brought Lord K. to the\r\ndetermination of parting with me, after which nothing remained but to\r\nsettle our accounts. This was done, and a balance being due to me of\r\nabout 600_l._ or 700_l._, I informed his Lordship that I waited only to\r\nbe paid in order to set off for England. Here was a demur, and Major\r\nThornhill came to inform me that his Lordship had not the money to pay\r\nme; several days passed in which I was in a very awkward state of\r\nuncertainty. It occurred to me as I saw no sign of payment to propose\r\nthat he should give me an annuity for life, which he at once agreed to.\r\nWhat that annuity should be I was perfectly ignorant, but there was an\r\nadvertisement in a London paper offering terms, which I sent to his\r\nLordship, with a note, informing him that if he would give me an annuity\r\non the terms there specified I would agree to it and free him for the\r\npresent from all payment. This his Lordship at once acceded to, and\r\nsigned a bond granting me an annuity for life of 72_l._,[60] according\r\nto the terms specified in the advertisement. This business being settled\r\nto the satisfaction of both parties, and my books packed up and sent to\r\nCork, I stepped into my post-chaise, and, with a pair of Irish nags, set\r\noff on a journey to Waterford on a visit to my excellent friend,\r\nCornelius Bolton, Junr. Esqr. M.P., where I waited for the packet to\r\nsail for Milford Haven long enough to have gone round by Dublin and have\r\nreached Rome or Naples. I had a miserable passage of three days and\r\nnights, a storm blowing us almost to Arklow, but through the providence\r\nof God we escaped the threatened dangers and landed safely in the\r\ndesired haven. I travelled post to London, and thus ended one of the\r\ngreatest speculations of my life, and I remember observing that in all\r\nprobability the providence of God was exerted to remove me from a\r\nkingdom in which no unconnected motives could induce me to remain. The\r\ntransaction was not absolutely free from circumstances in a measure\r\nfavourable to my future ease and repose. I had received 500_l._, which\r\ntook me out of some difficulties, and had the addition of 72_l._ per\r\nannum to my income, which was to me an object of some consideration. It\r\nalso removed me entirely from the farm in Hertfordshire, a most\r\nunprofitable one, and, what was better, from a winter residence in\r\nLondon. It also took me back to Bradfield to my aged mother, whose\r\nhealth was daily declining, and whose memory, being much impaired,\r\nsubjected her to imposition by tenants and servants.\r\n\r\n                             _To his Wife_\r\n\r\n                                           ‘Haverford West: Oct. 23.\r\n\r\n‘My Dearest,—It pleases God that I am once more to embrace you and my\r\nchildren—a passage that is common in eight hours was from Sunday morn\r\neight o’clock till one o’clock this morning Wednesday, thirty-six hours\r\nof which, a raging storm; we talk of them at land, but those who have\r\nnot seen them at sea know not what the very elements are. Pent up in the\r\nIrish Channel, the ship ran adrift, wearing[61] to keep free from rocks\r\nand sands—the wind did not blow, it was like volleys of artillery; part\r\nof the sails were torn into fritters; the waves were mountains high,\r\nwhile the ship was perfectly tossed on end of them; the cabin window\r\nburst open, and deluged everything afloat; the horses kicked and\r\ngroaned, the dogs howled; six passengers praying, shrieking, and\r\nvomiting; every soul sick but myself; the sailors swearing and storming;\r\nand the whole—such a scene! The Captain, who has been many voyages, and\r\nthe pilot thirty-six years, never saw such a storm—to last so long.\r\n\r\n‘It has worried and starved the horses so that I know not what I am to\r\ndo—shall go with them as far as I can, and if they knock up must leave\r\nthem and take some fly to be by you thirty-first; of which send\r\nimmediate notice to B.\r\n\r\n‘I know not if Bath be my nearest way, so let me have a letter at\r\nNicoll’s in case I am not in Town, to the same purport as that to Bath,\r\nto inform me what I am to do and when to go.\r\n\r\n                                          ‘Adieu,\r\n                                                 ‘Most truly yours,\r\n                                                              ‘A.

I arrived at Bradfield on the first of January, and had then\r\nfull time to reflect upon what should be the future pursuit of my life,\r\nand upon what plan I could devise for that fresh establishment of\r\nmyself, which should, at the same time, prevent any relapse into those\r\nodious dependencies upon uncertainties, which from 1771 to 1778 had been\r\nthe perpetual torment of my life. While I was hesitating what plan to\r\nfollow, an emigration to America arose in my mind and much occupied my\r\nthoughts. But the advanced period of my mother’s life and her\r\npersuasions against any scheme of that sort prevailed, and with some\r\nreluctance I relinquished it. I had also to consider, how far it would\r\nbe prudent to yield to her earnest entreaties to return to farming at\r\nBradfield and live with her. To stock a farm of any size would have been\r\nto me a matter of difficulty, but, at the same time, to get free from\r\nall London engagements, and to secure the tranquillity of a retired life\r\nafter all the stormy perplexities through which I had passed, was an\r\nobject full of attraction, and it prevailed. A small farm contiguous to\r\nthe old family mansion was to be vacant at Michaelmas, and notice was\r\naccordingly given to the tenant to quit. Thus was I once more engaged in\r\nhusbandry, with a prospect of gradually increasing my business according\r\nas my capital should enable me. Relative to my farm, it may here be\r\nproper once for all to observe, that as the leases of the estate fell\r\nvacant I gradually enlarged my occupation, till I had between three and\r\nfour hundred acres in hand, most amply stocked, and conducted with such\r\nan expense of labour as enabled me to support the credit of my\r\nhusbandry. I remained at Bradfield the whole year, and the only literary\r\npursuit I engaged in was a correspondence with Mr. Wight upon some\r\npoints in the Scotch system of farming; it was published in his ‘Present\r\nState of the Husbandry of Scotland.’[62] I had reason to believe that\r\nhis letters were written under the eye of Lord Kames,[63] the author of\r\nthe well-known work called, ‘The Gentleman Farmer,’ and much better\r\nknown book, ‘Elements of Criticism.’\r\n\r\nAbout this period I was elected a member of the Imperial Œconomical\r\nSociety of Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThe first event of the year 1780 was the publication of my Irish Tour in\r\none volume quarto. It was so successful and popular in both kingdoms\r\nthat it is unnecessary to expatiate upon it; thus much, however, I trust\r\nI may say without vanity, that it has stood the test of examination, and\r\nreceived from the best judges the highest commendation. But there is one\r\ncircumstance which appears never to have been sufficiently understood,\r\nor at least the _effect_ properly attributed to this work. Perhaps the\r\nmost novel, instructing, and decisively useful part of the publication\r\nwas the attack made upon the bounty paid on the land carriage of corn to\r\nDublin.[64] I therein proved beyond the possibility of doubt the gross\r\nabsurdity of the measure. The whole kingdom, however, without exception,\r\nconsidered this bounty as the great palladium of their national\r\nagriculture, and in conversation upon that subject with the most able\r\nmen then living there, I found them so strongly prejudiced in its favour\r\nthat they were not very willing to hear anything spoken against it. But\r\nit appeared to me so manifestly absurd that I exerted my industry to\r\nexamine the measure on its very foundation. When I was a complete master\r\nof the subject and stated the result in conversation to the warmest\r\nfriends of the measure, I had the satisfaction to find that the\r\ndocuments thus produced were utterly unknown to all, and they were\r\nfairly beat[65] out of their prejudices in favour of the measure; at\r\nleast their _argument_ entirely failed on the occasion. But the event\r\nproved that the conviction was real. For in the very first session after\r\nthe publication of my book the bounty was reduced by half, as appears by\r\nMr. Henry Cavendish’s publication on the revenue and national expenses\r\nof Ireland. It was afterwards gradually reduced, and at last gave up\r\nentirely. The saving to the nation occasioned palpably by this\r\npublication amounted to 40,000_l._ per annum immediately, and as the\r\nexpense of the bounty had been constantly increasing, the saving was of\r\ncourse in reality much greater. Long after, in conversation with Lord\r\nLoughborough, he told me that he had read that part of my work relative\r\nto the bounty, &c., with particular attention, and that he thought the\r\narguments most unanswerable, adding, ‘Ireland ought to have rewarded you\r\nfor that.’ When the whole was given up it was a saving of 80,000_l._ a\r\nyear to the nation. This was much for one individual to effect; and some\r\nreward for such services would not have been much for the nation to\r\ngrant.\r\n\r\nI cannot on such an occasion name Ireland without remarking that though\r\nthe Irish are certainly a generous people, and liberal sometimes almost\r\nto excess, yet not a ray of that spirit was by any public body shed on\r\nmy labours.\r\n\r\nAfter I had left the kingdom and published the tour, I received the\r\nfollowing letter:—\r\n\r\n                                            ‘Dublin: Sept. 16, 1780.\r\n\r\n  ‘Sir,—With great pleasure I take up the pen in obedience to the\r\n  commands of the Dublin Society, to communicate to you their thanks for\r\n  the late publication of your tour in Ireland, a treatise which, in\r\n  doing justice to this country, puts us in a most respectable view; for\r\n  which reason we consider you to have great merit. But what\r\n  particularly gained the attention of the Society were your just and\r\n  excellent observations and reasoning, in the second part of that work,\r\n  relative to the agriculture, manufactures, trade, and police of the\r\n  kingdom. And gentlemen thought the publication of that part,\r\n  particularly so as to fall into the hands of the generality of the\r\n  people of this country, might be of great benefit and use; and we wish\r\n  you would let us know your sentiments relative to the preparing a\r\n  publication of that kind, and in what mode you would think it most\r\n  proper, and would answer best, and what you would judge a reasonable\r\n  amends for all this trouble, that we may lay the same before the\r\n  Society at our next meeting, the beginning of November. There are a\r\n  great many useful observations and hints interspersed in many parts of\r\n  your tour which may be of great use to throw into the hands of the\r\n  public.\r\n\r\n                          ‘I am, Sir,\r\n                                   ‘Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                                      ‘RED. MORRES.’\r\n\r\nIn answer to this letter, I returned sincere thanks for the honour of\r\nthe vote; and assured them that I should be ready either to publish any\r\npart of the work separately, or to make an abridgment of the whole,\r\nreduced in such a manner as to be diffused at a small expense over all\r\nthe kingdom. In a few posts I received, under the Dublin post-mark, an\r\nenvelope, enclosing an anonymous essay, cut out of a newspaper, which\r\nreferred to the transactions of the Society relative to me, and\r\ncondemning pretty heavily my whole publication; and in this unhandsome\r\nmanner the business ended.\r\n\r\nIn a Society which disposed of 10,000_l._ a year of public money,\r\ngranted by Parliament chiefly with a view, as the Act expresses, to\r\nencourage agriculture, but which patronised manufacturers far more,\r\nthere will necessarily be an agricultural party and a manufacturing one.\r\nAccording as one or the other happens to prevail, such contradictions\r\nwill arise. All that is to be said of my case now is, that it was not so\r\nbad as that of poor Whyman Baker, who settled in Ireland as their\r\nexperimenter in agriculture—lived there in poverty ten or twelve\r\nyears—and broke his heart on account of the treatment which he met with.\r\nBut while their Societies acted thus, the Parliament of the kingdom paid\r\nmy book a much greater compliment than any Society could do; for they\r\npassed more than one Act almost directly, to alter and vary the police\r\nof corn, which I had proved was vicious, but which till then had been\r\nuniversally esteemed as the chief pillar of their national prosperity,\r\nand I had thus the satisfaction to see the Legislature of the kingdom\r\nimproving the policy of it from the known and confessed suggestions of a\r\nwork that, in other respects, had proved to the author a mere barren\r\nblank. I have, however, since heard from many most respectable gentlemen\r\nof that nation, as well as from the correspondence of others, that the\r\nbook is even now esteemed of some value to Ireland, and that the\r\nagriculture of the kingdom has been advanced in consequence. But it is\r\ntime to dismiss a subject upon which I have dilated too much, and spoken\r\nperhaps with an unguarded vanity and self-love which would ill become\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI was the chief part of this year at Bradfield, but I had bought at\r\nLondon a pair of roan mares for drawing a post-chaise, and having the\r\nsmall farm in hand, I made myself by practice no bad ploughman, and\r\ncould finish the stetches[66] neatly, and execute everything except the\r\nrivalling the Suffolk ploughman in drawing straight furrows to a mark\r\nset for that purpose; yet I overcame this difficulty in a manner that\r\nwould have been commended in any other county.\r\n\r\nThe Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce\r\nvoted me their Honorary Medal for some experiments I had communicated to\r\nthem on the culture of potatoes.\r\n\r\nAccording to custom, part of my time was occupied in reading, and among\r\nother works was highly entertained with Gray’s letters, and particularly\r\nwith the following passage, which displays so much knowledge of the\r\nhuman mind, and, at the same time, much sterling sense: ‘To find oneself\r\nbusiness I am persuaded is the great art of life, and I am never so\r\nangry as when I hear my acquaintance wishing they had been bred to some\r\npoking profession, or employed in some office of drudgery, as if it were\r\npleasanter to be at the command of other people than at one’s own, and\r\nas if they could not go unless they were wound up. Yet I know and feel\r\nwhat they mean by this complaint; it proves that some spirit, something\r\nof genius (more than common) is required to teach a man how to employ\r\nhimself—I say a man, for women, commonly speaking, never feel this\r\ndistemper, they have always something to do. Time hangs not on their\r\nhands (unless they be fine ladies), a variety of small inventions and\r\noccupations fill up the void, and their eyes are never open in vain’\r\n(vol. ii.)\r\n\r\nThank heaven, I have so much of the woman in me as to possess this\r\nfaculty of employing myself. The day is never too long, for I think time\r\nspent in reading is always well employed, unless a man reads like an\r\nidiot, that is, equally removed from instruction and entertainment. Now\r\nthe general occupation of my life—agriculture—has the happy circumstance\r\nof giving much employment, and with it exercise, at the same time that\r\nit naturally leads into a course of reading, to which it gives the air\r\nand turn of a study, and consequently renders it more interesting, an\r\nadvantage I shall be solicitous to preserve, by persisting, at all\r\nevents, to be much interested in farming, even though I should not\r\ncontinue an actual farmer. Gray felt the advantage of country pursuits.\r\n‘Happy they that can create a rose tree or erect a honeysuckle, that can\r\nwatch the brood of a hen, or see a fleet of their own ducklings launch\r\ninto the water; it is with a sentiment of envy I speak it, who never\r\nshall have even a thatched roof of my own, nor gather a strawberry but\r\nin Covent Garden.’\r\n\r\nI read also Roberts’ ‘Map of Commerce,’[67] and find the following\r\nextract about the spot where should be the ruin of Troy: ‘Anno Domini,\r\n1620.—I hardly saw the relics of this mighty fabric (Troy), though I\r\ntraced it for many miles, and gave ear to all the ridiculous fables of\r\nthose poor Grecians that inhabit thereabouts in many villages within the\r\ncompass of her ancient walls, from Mount Ida to the River Scamander, now\r\nonly a brook not two feet deep, so that what Ovid said of old I found by\r\nexperience verified, “jam seges est ubi Troja fuit.”’ There is a\r\nmelancholy which attends such reflections that with me makes a deep\r\nimpression; the idea that what was once the seat of power, arts,\r\nliterature and elegance is now in the most miserable situation which\r\nTurkish oppression and Mahometan superstition can inflict, that not a\r\ntrace of a once mighty city is now to be found, is depressing to the\r\nhuman mind. In an equal series of time what will become of the cities\r\nwhich are now the pride of Europe? what obscure farmer of futurity shall\r\nplough the ground whereon that House of Common stands in which a\r\nHampden, a Bolingbroke, a Pitt, and a Mansfield have delighted the most\r\ncelebrated assembly now in the world?[68]\r\n\r\nMy visit to London was, part of it, very agreeable, my whole intercourse\r\nwith Arbuthnot entirely so. At Dr. Burney’s, while it lasted, the same;\r\nthe opera, parties, the Royal Society, with some of the attendance on\r\nParliament, add to this being in the world and on the spot for whatever\r\nhappened, were all so many opportunities for pleasure and amusement,\r\nwhich, however, I did not make the most of. Against these I must now\r\nrank ease in my circumstances. Let it fly, and the change has been a bad\r\none, indeed. But I think I have resolution enough to take special care\r\nof the greatest of all man’s chances. I do not remember when my\r\nacquaintance with Mr. Hugh Boyd[69] began, but I was acquainted with him\r\nin London, met him in many companies in Dublin, and travelled with him\r\nfrom thence to London. It has been supposed that he was the author of\r\n‘Junius,’ and I must give it as my opinion that there was much\r\nprobability in the supposition. I have been many times at his house, at\r\nbreakfasts, morning calls and dinners, and never without seeing the\r\n_Public Advertiser_ and remarking that they were blanks, that is to say,\r\nwithout being stamped. All writers in newspapers are allowed a copy\r\ngratis, and these are never stamped. His company was so much sought\r\nafter in Dublin that I was scarcely at a great dinner without his being\r\npresent. A very striking circumstance in his character was a memory in\r\nsome points beyond example; he would multiply nine figures by eight\r\nentirely in his head, and would give the result with the most perfect\r\naccuracy. When it is considered that such an operation demands the\r\nrecollection not merely of the figures, but of their position in order\r\nfor the final addition, it must be admitted to be a stupendous one. He\r\nwas on all occasions and in every circumstance a most pleasing,\r\nagreeable companion. His wife was a woman of very good understanding,\r\nand appeared to be sensible of her husband’s extraordinary talents. One\r\nmorning at breakfast Mr. Burke’s son came in, and as his father had made\r\na very celebrated speech the day before in the House of Commons which he\r\nintended to publish, but had, in the conclusion, departed from his notes\r\nin a very fine strain of eloquence, knowing the great memory of Boyd, he\r\nsent his son to request some hints for that conclusion. We set to work\r\nto recollect as much as possible his own words, and furnished young\r\nBurke much to his satisfaction. Mr. Boyd’s letters, of which I have\r\npreserved several, are written in a most pleasing, lively style.\r\n\r\n                                   ‘Norfolk Street: August 16, 1780.\r\n\r\n  ‘My dear Sir,—You have an excellent physician, but I should be glad to\r\n  know what right the patient has to become his own apothecary? The\r\n  doctor’s prescription consists of such rare ingredients as require no\r\n  common skill to discover and use, _Cuivis in suâ arte_. If it had been\r\n  your inferior fate to wield the pestle instead of the ploughshare and\r\n  the pen, I should subscribe to the judgment of the apothecary as fully\r\n  as I do to the author’s genius and the farmer’s knowledge. “A friend\r\n  who can enliven the dulness of the country.” Well said, doctor.\r\n  Macbeth himself might take your advice, for there is little difference\r\n  between a dull mind and “a mind diseased;” but my good friend has\r\n  neither. His mistake, therefore, in making up your prescription, and\r\n  shaking me up as the aforesaid ingredient, is of little consequence.\r\n  To convince him, however, that he is mistaken—for I love to set your\r\n  clever men right—I shall make my appearance, first in the county of\r\n  Cambridge, and next in the county of Suffolk—or ere the amorous Phœbus\r\n  shall have twice resorted to his evening assignation to take an oyster\r\n  with Miss Thetis. By the bye, we have had very good [entertainment] in\r\n  town for some days—though as to days I can only answer for one and a\r\n  half; being no longer returned from a Western Tour, which I have had\r\n  the pleasure and trouble of making—for everything is mixed, you know,\r\n  pleasure and pain—rose and thorns—man and wife; I ask Mrs. Young ten\r\n  thousand pardons.\r\n\r\n  ‘I have had hopes sometimes of tempting Mrs. B. to a country\r\n  excursion, and she has almost agreed to make it with me to Cambridge,\r\n  where I wish to call for half a day, and perhaps longer, soon; the\r\n  hopes of seeing her friends at Bradfield Hall are a strong inducement.\r\n\r\n                                      ‘Believe me,\r\n                                             ‘Very sincerely yours,\r\n                                                          ‘H. BOYD.’\r\n\r\n                                                   ‘August 17, 1780.\r\n\r\n  ‘My good friend will be at least just in this instance, when he is in\r\n  every other so partial to his friends; and you’ll believe that it is\r\n  no small disappointment to me _quod_ inclination, though the cause\r\n  will probably be very advantageous, _businessly_ speaking, that I am\r\n  obliged to postpone my Suffolk trip. Observe I establish a credit by\r\n  the term postpone, and I sincerely hope it will not be a long term. I\r\n  have at present only another half minute to say fifty things. But not\r\n  being able to think, speak, or write the fiftieth part as quick as\r\n  certain persons of my acquaintance (my love to Mrs. Young), I must\r\n  confine myself to one subject—which I have too much at heart to\r\n  omit—the assuring you and her of my being very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                          ‘H. BOYD.’\r\n\r\n                                                 ‘September 2, 1780.\r\n\r\n  ‘My dear Friends,—You’ll excuse coarse paper, and coarse writing in\r\n  every sense, I’m afraid, “in matter, form, and style,” according to\r\n  Milton’s divisions, when you know that I sit down to this delectable\r\n  epistle in a City coffee-house, in the midst of Bob-wigs and worsted\r\n  stocking knaves, Turks, Jews, and brokers, infidels, and merchants.\r\n  _Nunquam, si quid mihi credis, amavi Hos homines._ O dialect of Babel!\r\n  \"Who calls for coffee?\"—\"This policy, sir\"—\"Strong convoy, a very good\r\n  thing\"—\"Pen, ink, and wafer\"—\"I’sh would be rejoished to _do_ for you,\r\n  shur\"—\"Was Mr. Shylock here this morning?\"—“Yesh, just gone to\r\n  Jerusalem.” O blessed race! I wish you were all there, with all your\r\n  adopted brethren of Jewish Christians from this holy land.\r\n\r\n  ‘I have continued in much disappointment—at least, suspense—since I\r\n  wrote to you last, when I hinted the sudden occurrence of some\r\n  business preventing the pleasure of my proposed trip. Depending on the\r\n  pleasures not only of some three or four different persons, but of\r\n  great ones, too, who think themselves _personages_, you will not\r\n  wonder that the said business has been like Sisyphus’s Stone, or\r\n  Ixion’s Cloud, or Tantalus’s Apple, or anything else that’s infernally\r\n  troublesome. But it may, and, notwithstanding their greatness,\r\n  probably it will, be very consequential. In the meantime I must deny\r\n  myself both Suffolk and Cambridge. The former, indeed, is the\r\n  self-denial; for Cam. I had more at head than at heart. Besides,\r\n  wishing to establish my Mastery of Arts by a little residence near\r\n  them, I had a little reading and writing also in contemplation, near\r\n  the walks locally—_perlongo intervallo_ in every other sense—of old\r\n  Erasmus.\r\n\r\n  ‘I should have been happy in being at Bradfield Hall; I long to hear\r\n  my friend refute himself, to complain with good spirits, and to\r\n  demonstrate, with much wit, that he was extremely dull. But I dare say\r\n  you have too much genuine vivacity, as well as good taste, to enter\r\n  much into the bastard sort of alacrity—the intoxicated bustle that\r\n  rages in empty heads and full pockets, by Royal proclamation. I should\r\n  not object if the _cui bono_? could be answered. But in the present\r\n  desperate size of power and depopulation of spirit, so much and so\r\n  expensive pains seem little better than a curious folly. If a man’s\r\n  brains must be blown out, why need he gild his pocket pistol, much\r\n  less purchase a great gun—unless it be a _Scotch canonade_, which, it\r\n  must be confessed, will do the business, _con amore_, for England or\r\n  Ireland?\r\n\r\n                                                   ‘Yours ever,\r\n                                                          ‘H. BOYD.’\r\n\r\nI continued farming at Bradfield, and also reading and writing with much\r\nattention, as about this time I had formed the intention of delivering\r\nlectures on agriculture, and had prepared several. The original hint\r\ncame from Mr. Wedderburn,[70] who persuaded me to persevere in this\r\nplan; but the lectures never took place. I was highly honoured by the\r\ncommendation and partiality of a friend, Dr. Watson,[71] the celebrated\r\nProfessor at Cambridge, afterwards Bishop of Llandaff, who wrote thus:\r\n‘We owe to the agricultural societies, and to the patriotic exertions of\r\none deserving citizen (Arthur Young, Esq.), the present flourishing\r\ncondition of our husbandry’ (‘Chemical Mag.’ vol. 4).\r\n\r\nI find from an application of my friend, Arbuthnot, that the Bishop of\r\nChester was at this time collecting materials for a work on population\r\nby the Rev. Mr. Howlett,[72] and had desired Arbuthnot to apply to me\r\nfor assistance. I was myself meditating such a work, but complied with\r\nthe request, and transmitted the collections I had made to the Bishop,\r\nwho wrote me a most obliging letter.\r\n\r\n  ‘Your facts are clear and decisive, and the conclusions you draw from\r\n  them, unanswerable. The only difficulty I am apprehensive of is that\r\n  as his work is now pretty far advanced, and is already larger than I\r\n  could wish he will not be able to take in the whole of your papers,\r\n  especially as I observe that he has in some part of his pamphlet\r\n  fallen into the same train of reasoning as yourself. If, therefore,\r\n  you would allow him to take only your two general tables of baptism\r\n  before and after the Revolution, and the two more recent periods of\r\n  thirty years each, which is the very method he has himself adopted,\r\n  subjoining such of your observations as are the most important and are\r\n  not in some measure anticipated by him, he will be most exceedingly\r\n  obliged to you, and will, I am sure, be very ready to acknowledge in\r\n  proper terms the sense he has of your goodness to him.’\r\n\r\nI had also a sad letter from my friend Arbuthnot on his return from\r\nFrance, but it was written in so melancholy a strain on his own\r\nsituation and that of his wife and family, that it has often made my\r\nheart ache to read it. By Lord Loughborough’s interest he got an\r\nappointment in Ireland under the Linen Board,[73] which carried him to\r\nthat country, where he lived but a few years. I lost in him by far the\r\nmost agreeable friend I was ever connected with.\r\n\r\nAt this time I was much engaged in making a variety of experiments in\r\nexpelling gaseous fluids from specimens of soils, the results of which\r\nwere afterwards published in ‘The Annals of Agriculture.’ As I met with\r\nsome difficulties I wrote to Dr. Priestley, stating them, and begging\r\ninformation. He very liberally and politely answered all my enquiries,\r\nencouraging me to proceed with my trials, and I received several\r\ninteresting letters from him.\r\n\r\n                                         ‘Birmingham: Dec. 12, 1781.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—If I had any remarks or hints respecting the subject of\r\n  your experiments, I should certainly with much pleasure have\r\n  communicated them long ago. I meant, indeed, to have made a few more\r\n  experiments on the growth of plants in the course of the last summer,\r\n  but the weather was so bad, and the sun shone so little, that I\r\n  dropped the scheme. All I can do, therefore, in return for your\r\n  _facts_, is to mention one that I have lately observed. I readily\r\n  convert _pure water_ into _permanent air_, by first combining it with\r\n  quicklime, and then exposing it to a strong heat. The weight of the\r\n  air is equal to the weight of water, and no part of the water is\r\n  turned into _steam_ in the process. During the whole of it, a glass\r\n  velum, interposed between the retort and the recipient for the air,\r\n  remains quite cool and dry. The air I procure in this manner is in\r\n  part _fixed air_, but the bulk of it is such as a candle would hardly\r\n  burn in it, but is such as I should imagine would be the best for\r\n  plants, which would purify it and render it fit for respiration. And\r\n  as this kind of air would be yielded in great abundance by volcanoes,\r\n  from calcareous matter in the earth; such was perhaps the original\r\n  atmosphere of this earth, which according to the Mosaick account\r\n  (which you must allow me to respect) had plants before there were any\r\n  land animals.\r\n\r\n  ‘This letter I fear is hardly worth sending you; your objects and mine\r\n  are so very different, though now and then coinciding; but mine have\r\n  seldom any practical uses, at least no immediate ones, whereas yours\r\n  are highly and immediately beneficial. Wishing you the greatest\r\n  success, and wishing you and all philosophers joy of the near prospect\r\n  of peace,\r\n\r\n                                             ‘I am, yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n                     ‘J. PRIESTLEY.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThis year’s memoranda: ‘Wrote “Emigration,” an ode.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of this year I spent a month at Lowestoft, where the sea\r\nair and bathing agreed so well with me that I do not recollect in my\r\nlife ever having spent a month with so continued a flow of high spirits,\r\nwhich received no slight addition by the society of a very handsome and\r\nmost agreeable girl, whose name I have forgotten.[74]\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Dr. Burney (of this year) he rallied me with much wit\r\non my culture of the earth instead of the Muses. This friend of mine had\r\na happy talent of rendering his letters lively and agreeable, indeed\r\nthey were a picture of the man, for I never met with any person who had\r\nmore decided talents for conversation, eminently seasoned with wit and\r\nhumour, and these talents were so at command that he could exert them at\r\nwill. He was remarkable for some sprightly story or witty _bon mot_ just\r\nwhen he quitted a company, which seemed as much as to say, ‘There now, I\r\nhave given you a dose which you may work upon in my absence.’ His\r\nsociety was greatly sought after by all classes, from the first nobility\r\nto the mere _homme de lettres_. He dressed expensively, always kept his\r\ncarriage, and yet died worth about 15,000_l._, leaving a most capital\r\nlibrary of curious books. His second wife was my wife’s sister, the\r\nhandsome widow of a Mr. Allen, of Lynn, who in a short life in commerce\r\nmade above 40,000_l._, leaving her a handsome fortune and her two\r\ndaughters equally provided for.\r\n\r\nThis year I had a controversy in the ‘Bury St. Edmunds News’ with Capel\r\nLofft, Esq.,[75] on the proposal which originated with the Earl of\r\nBristol,[76] for building a 74-gun ship and presenting it to the public.\r\nI wrote a paper in favour of this scheme, which so pleased Lord Bristol\r\nthat he complimented me on my eloquent, spirited language, and he caused\r\na numerous edition of it to be printed and given away. Lofft attacked\r\nthe scheme as unconstitutional, I retorted, and a paper war ensued which\r\nlasted for some time, and was afterwards published. The Earl of\r\nShelburne, at that time Minister, wrote several letters to Lord Bristol\r\nin which he appeared highly gratified by this plan. Capel Lofft at the\r\nconclusion of our controversy wrote to me a very polite letter,\r\nexpressing his satisfaction that our names should be united in the same\r\npublication. These papers were read with much avidity, and established\r\nthe Bury paper in which they were written, to the great emolument of the\r\nproprietor.\r\n\r\nPrince Potemkin, the Russian Prime Minister, sent this year to England\r\nthree young men consigned to the care of M. Smirnove, chaplain to the\r\nRussian Embassy, who requested that I would fix them in my immediate\r\nvicinity, in order that I might pay some attention to their progress and\r\nacquisitions. This I readily did, and took every means to have them well\r\ninstructed in the English mode of cultivating land.[77]\r\n\r\n1782.—This year Mrs. Cousmaker, sister to my mother, died in her house\r\nat Bradfield. She was a maiden lady who never would marry, though she\r\nhad several advantageous offers. She left me her house and two farms,\r\nand a long annuity in the funds of 150_l._ a year, which expired about\r\nfifteen years afterwards. She had 300_l._ per annum of three annuities,\r\nthe whole of which had once been left to me, but being much offended\r\nwith my wife she gave half of it to another person. She also left me her\r\ncarriage and horses. She was a very religious character; the bequest in\r\nher will by which she left the farms to me was not expressed exactly\r\naccording to her mind, and she therefore altered it with her own hand\r\nafter executing the will. This vitiated the legacy, on consulting Lord\r\nLoughborough, and he had doubts upon the question; but upon taking the\r\nopinion of several great lawyers, they declared the legacy null, and\r\nthat the estates lapsed to the heir of law. This was John Cousmaker,\r\nEsq., of Hackney, who very generously declared that he would not take\r\nadvantage of the error, and desired that Joshua Sharpe, a celebrated\r\nsolicitor, might draw up a deed, by which he might make good the\r\nintention, which was accordingly done. Such an instance of uncommon\r\nliberality deserves to be recorded for the credit of mankind.\r\n\r\nThis year the Episcopal Earl of Bristol lived at Ickworth both summer\r\nand winter, and having very early called upon me after coming to the\r\ntitle and estate, a great intimacy took place between us; and Lord B.\r\ndesired me to dine with him every Thursday, which I did through the\r\nwhole year. Mr. Symonds, Professor of Modern History at Cambridge, Sir\r\nJohn Cullum,[78] author of the ‘History of Hawstead,’ a very learned\r\nantiquary, and the Rev. George Ashby, Rector of Barrow,[79] another\r\nantiquary, and a man of universal knowledge, who for many years wrote a\r\nmultitude of papers in the ‘Gentleman’s Magazine,’ being constantly of\r\nthe party. It was a trait in this nobleman’s character, which deserved\r\nsomething more than admiration, to select men distinguished for\r\nknowledge and ability as his companions.\r\n\r\nLord Bristol was one of the most extraordinary men I ever met with. He\r\nwas a perfect original—dressed in classical adorning; he had lived much\r\nabroad, spoke all modern languages fluently, and had an uncommon vein of\r\npleasantry and wit, which he greatly exerted, and without reserve, when\r\nin the company of a few select friends. When abroad, and for many years\r\nafterwards, he lived in a manner that was not very episcopal. He had\r\nbeen so long absent from Ireland that the Primate wrote him three\r\nletters of remonstrance, and the answer he sent him was to do up and\r\nsend in three blue peas in a blue bladder. The old proverb symptomatic\r\nof contempt, ‘Oh! that is but three blue peas,’ &c., is well known. The\r\nBishop removing, he could not be forced back, and remained where he was.\r\nIn my life I never passed more agreeable days than these weekly dinners\r\nat Ickworth. The conversation was equally instructive and agreeable.\r\nThis eccentric man built in Ireland a large and very expensive round\r\nhouse, on a plan as singular as himself; and, what was more\r\nextraordinary, a repetition of it at Ickworth. The shell of the body was\r\nfinished and covered in; the wings scarcely begun, and nothing done\r\ntowards completing the centre. Above 40,000_l._ was expended, and it\r\nwould require much more than forty more to finish it on the original\r\nplan, after which it would be nearly uninhabitable. Lady Bristol used to\r\ncall it a stupendous monument of folly; but the most extraordinary\r\ncircumstance in relation to it was, that he began it while he disliked\r\nthe spot, from the wetness of the soil, and would often tell me that he\r\nshould never be such a fool as to build in so wet a situation. It was\r\nthen generally imagined that as he must inherit Rushbrooke he would wait\r\ntill that period, and if he built at all, would do it there. It was\r\nbegun and carried on till the time of his death without his ever having\r\nseen it; and he often declared in letters that he never would set his\r\nfoot in England till it was finished and furnished with all the _vertu_\r\nthat he had collected in Italy. He never did set his foot in England\r\nagain, for the shell of this fantastic building, and that of its still\r\nmore extraordinary possessor, were finished at the same time, and my\r\nLord left the whole, as if by design, a burthen to his son and\r\nsuccessor, with whom he had been on the worst terms, and from whom he\r\ngave away by will the very furniture of the old habitable house at\r\nIckworth. At the Thursday dinners I, of course, met all who were\r\nvisitors to the family, among whom Lord B.’s uncle, General Hervey, was\r\nsometimes present. This was another uncommon character in some respects,\r\nbut had not half the originality of his brother. He, too, was a most\r\ndetermined infidel, but had so far an expectation, not only of a future\r\nstate, but also a kind of instinctive belief of the possibility of\r\nrewards and punishments, that acting happily for others, poor man, if\r\nnot for himself, this half-faced belief made him one of the most\r\ncharitable men living. His morning rides were generally amongst the poor\r\nof the neighbouring parishes, amongst whom he distributed clothing,\r\nfood, and bedding, with money to take them out of difficulties, in a\r\nspirit of liberality rarely equalled, and gave away during a long course\r\nof years more in charity than thousands who had ten times his fortune.\r\nThis instance may excite a reflection upon the weakness of judging a\r\nman’s religion only by his works; for surely it would be a strange\r\nabsurdity to take the measure of piety in the heart by any circumstance\r\nof the conduct which would be emulated or surpassed by an infidel. But\r\nwhat is charity when the right motive is wanting?\r\n\r\nIn my library[80] is a complete edition of Rousseau’s works, given me by\r\nthe Earl of Bristol.\r\n\r\nAbout this time my friend, the Rev. Mr. Valpy,[81] who had for some time\r\nbeen Usher at the Grammar School of Bury St. Edmunds, was elected master\r\nof that at Reading, and a correspondence commenced which lasted many\r\nyears. He was a most learned, ingenious and agreeable man, in so much\r\nthat I greatly regretted his departure, feeling most sensibly the loss\r\nof his society. I have been occasionally connected with him since, and\r\nshall always hold him in great estimation for his learning, his talents,\r\nand sincerity of friendship. My son was under his tuition for some\r\nyears. In the following letter my brother describes the state of this\r\nnation, which he thinks miserably bad:—\r\n\r\n                                       ‘Eton College: Oct. 31, 1782.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Arthur,—I wrote to you three days ago, and yesterday I received\r\n  yours, complaining that I write no politicks. If you can, I cannot\r\n  think of them with any degree of patience. We are a ruined people,\r\n  tearing ourselves to pieces, everyone thinking of his party and\r\n  himself, and no one caring for the publick, and that is the truth\r\n  whatever you may hear or read. There is not a blockhead in England,\r\n  who can only read and write and some who can only sign their names, of\r\n  whom I could give you instances, who does not think himself qualified\r\n  to new model the constitution. All true regard for liberty, and law,\r\n  and a free government is gone, and there seems to be a general\r\n  resolution not to be governed at all, which must end in despotism. We\r\n  have no Ministry, nor do I see how we can have any. The whole summer\r\n  has been spent in enlisting recruits against the winter. The friends\r\n  of the old Ministry give out that Lord North has the decisive votes,\r\n  which I think may be true. He was very lately unengaged, and, I am\r\n  glad to hear, has declared positively against all innovations. For I\r\n  am sure there is neither honesty, nor knowledge, nor abilities in this\r\n  generation, to be trusted with altering our constitution. There are\r\n  but two modes of governing—by power, or by influence. I desire to be\r\n  governed by influence, but not that the influence may be so great as\r\n  to be equivalent to power. I think that the Bill,[82] taking away the\r\n  votes of the Revenue officers, will have great effect if ever\r\n  executed, and am against proceeding further till I see the\r\n  consequences of that Bill. I would annihilate the enormous plates in\r\n  the Exchequer, but that would not much affect the influence of the\r\n  Crown. As to increasing the Navy—what do you mean? Can you possibly\r\n  increase your Navy without increasing the number of your seamen? And\r\n  can you increase them without increasing your trade? You have already\r\n  more ships than you can man. When your silly Suffolk scheme of\r\n  building a ship was first mentioned to Lord Keppel, he said: If they\r\n  could find him seamen he should be obliged to them, for he had ten\r\n  more ships ready if he had seamen to put into them. We have got into\r\n  one of those stupid wars which the Tories have always clamoured for, a\r\n  naval war with France, without any land war in which our men might die\r\n  in German ditches; we pay no subsidies to German princes for defending\r\n  themselves, and you see how it has succeeded. The French having no\r\n  diversion of their wealth to a land war are superior at sea, as any\r\n  man of common sense might have foreseen. If your Suffolk gentry would\r\n  take care of their own duty and suppress the smuggling on their coast,\r\n  it would be well. The Parliament will supply Government with money,\r\n  levied equally on the subject, to build ships as they are wanted; and\r\n  Government is by common law armed with power to avail itself of every\r\n  seaman in the country; and that is the only just and equitable way of\r\n  providing a Navy.\r\n\r\n  ‘I shall be in town next month, and will call on our Aunt Ingoldsby. I\r\n  am sorry to hear that my mother’s memory fails so fast; it frightens\r\n  me out of my wits every time I forget anything.\r\n\r\n                                     ‘Yours very affectionately,\r\n                                                         ‘J.

I\r\nmyself was firmly persuaded that it was not, as they declared, the cause\r\nof my illness, and therefore when I was perfectly recovered resumed the\r\npractice, which I continued for many years; and I once at Petworth, at\r\nLord Egremont’s, went into the bath at four in the morning, when the\r\nthermometer was below zero. Upon coming out, walked into the shrubbery,\r\nand rolled myself in the snow as an experiment to see the effect on my\r\nbody; it had none, except that of increasing strength and activity, and\r\nwas not at all disagreeable.\r\n\r\nIn January commenced one of the greatest speculations in my life—the\r\npublication of ‘The Annals of Agriculture.’ I had long meditated such a\r\nwork, and corresponded upon it with Mr. Whyman Baker, of Ireland, who\r\nhad promised communications. The plan which first suggested itself was\r\npeculiar, and to the exclusion of all private profit—with a constant\r\npublication of the printing and publishing accounts—but the booksellers\r\napplied to, rejected the idea, and the work appeared monthly, with very\r\nindifferent success, for about a twelvemonth. The correspondence being\r\nhighly respectable, and no papers inserted without the name and place of\r\nabode of the writer, it rose gradually to the support of itself, and\r\nafter a time enabled me to insert a great number of plates. It would\r\nhave proved a very profitable publication but for the many numbers which\r\nwere obliged to be reprinted. Printing only 500 afterwards occasioned\r\nreprinting another 500, still a third 500. This created so large an\r\nexpense that it swallowed up everything that wore the resemblance of\r\nprofit, and many years afterwards I continued reprinting various numbers\r\nfor the sole object of completing sets; this formed a back current;\r\nwhich carried away what would have been profit. It may be added that\r\nmany of those papers written by myself, forming perhaps a third or\r\nfourth of the whole work, may be reckoned among my most valuable\r\nproductions, and have received the sanction of approbation, by being\r\ntranslated into several foreign languages. It is an anecdote which\r\ncannot be generally known, that two very able letters, which came under\r\nthe name of Robinson, the King’s shepherd at Windsor, were really the\r\nproduction of his Majesty’s own pen, describing what he had long been\r\nintimately acquainted with, the husbandry of Mr. Ducket. The King took\r\nin two sets of the work, one of which he regularly sent to that farmer;\r\nand in the interview which I had with his Majesty upon the terrace of\r\nWindsor, the first word the King said to me was: ‘Mr. Y., I consider\r\nmyself as more obliged to you than to any other man in my dominions,’\r\nand the Queen told me that they never travelled without my ‘Annals’ in\r\nthe carriage. Lord Fife informed me that he himself always had the\r\n‘Annals’ sent him the moment they were published, but still he always\r\nfound that the King was beforehand with him, for upon the first of the\r\nmonth, while the number was unopened upon his table, riding out and\r\nmeeting his Majesty, he at once spoke to him on a paper of his own (Lord\r\nFife’s) in that number, showing that he had read the whole before it had\r\nmet the eye of the author.\r\n\r\nAmong the letters I received this year the following may be particularly\r\nnoted:—\r\n\r\n                                  _l._\r\n\r\n                                        ‘Londonderry: April 23,1783.\r\n\r\n  ‘A thousand thanks to you, my dear friend, for your recollection of me\r\n  at so many miles’ distance, and for your summary Gazette of the\r\n  present miscellaneous state of our neighbours, but no thanks at all to\r\n  you for wishing me back to the foggy, fenny atmosphere of Ickworth, in\r\n  preference to the exhilarating and invigorating air, or rather ether,\r\n  of the Downhill. When you are _vapid_, if ever those _pétillant_\r\n  spirits of yours are so, come and imbibe some fixed or unfixed air at\r\n  the Downhill, where a tree is no longer a _rarity_, since above\r\n  200,000 have this winter been planted in the glens round my house;\r\n  come and enjoy the rapidity and the success with which I have\r\n  converted sixty acres of moor, by the medium of two hundred spades,\r\n  into a _green_ carpet, sprinkled with white clover.

Now is\r\n  the moment to execute this great purpose; the _reserved_ acres amount\r\n  to several thousands, and upon one mountain only I have received\r\n  proposals for building 200 cabbins (cabins); the limestone is at the\r\n  bottom of the hill, and the turf at the top. What gold may not this\r\n  chemistry produce, and who do you think would himself submit to\r\n  vegetate at Ickworth whilst he can direct such a laboratory at the\r\n  Downhill?\r\n\r\n  ‘Can Ashby crawl—_Quantum mutatus ab illo?_ I shall next expect to\r\n  hear of Arthur’s creeping.

The following letters are from James Barry,[87] the celebrated\r\npainter. This was a very singular character. I sat to him for the\r\nportrait which he inserted in his famous painting for the decoration of\r\nthe Society’s room.[88] I met him often at Dr. Burney’s, and always\r\nfound him to abound with original observations, which marked a character\r\npeculiarly his own. He always seemed to me to be proud of his poverty.\r\n\r\n                                               ‘Adelphi: April 1783.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—I am very much obliged to you for your kind letter, and\r\n  hope your goodness will make every allowance for my not having\r\n  answered it sooner, but of all things I hate writing at any time, more\r\n  particularly at present, when I had resolved to allow myself some\r\n  days’ Sabbath, to the utter exclusion of all manner of labour, even of\r\n  that which was most agreeable to me.

Judge, then, what a pleasure\r\n  I am receiving in the perusal of your book. You have, I find, probed\r\n  the evil to the bottom, and left me without a wish. The men of Ireland\r\n  are surely much indebted to you, and will, I trust, one day\r\n  acknowledge it, but for the present you must have patience and ought\r\n  to bear with them, as the illiberality or meanness you may justly\r\n  complain of may fairly be ascribed to an unhappy combination of\r\n  circumstances, owing principally to the tyrannical monopolising\r\n  disposition and rascally interference of your own forefathers, who had\r\n  with the most abominable and diabolical policy employed their whole\r\n  skill and power utterly to erase from the minds of Irishmen all those\r\n  noble and generous feelings which were incompatible with a servile and\r\n  enslaved condition, and which ultimately estranged them from the\r\n  exercise of even the ordinary vulgar virtues.\r\n\r\n  ‘In situations where men are divided into large bodies of tyrants and\r\n  slaves, little good is to be expected. Their vices may differ, but\r\n  they are all equally remote from virtue, truth, justice, gratitude,\r\n  the love of excellence, or any other of those qualities which\r\n  constitute the real dignity of human nature. Those who are attached to\r\n  no country or description of men, but for the ends and furtherance of\r\n  humanity, by equal justice and happiness, will with me rejoice and\r\n  give Almighty God thanks for the dissolution of whatever has hitherto\r\n  obstructed the growth and spreading of virtue, and for that just sense\r\n  of the human dignity which is now diffusing itself so extensively in\r\n  Ireland, and gives fair prospect of a plentiful harvest (in due\r\n  season) of those other virtues which, though but thinly scattered in\r\n  England, are at present, I fear, in vain to be sought for anywhere\r\n  else.\r\n\r\n                                      ‘Yours most affectionately,\r\n                                                      ‘JAMES BARRY.’\r\n\r\nAt this period commenced a most agreeable acquaintance with a French\r\ngentleman who came to Bury, and I must dilate a little on the origin of\r\nhis journey. The Duke of Liancourt[90] was Colonel of a French regiment,\r\nthe quarters of which were at Pont à Mousson, in Lorraine, to which he\r\nwent every year, according to the regulations of the French army. At\r\nthat place he accidentally met Monsieur de Lazowski,[91] son of a Pole,\r\nwho came to Lorraine with King Stanislas. The Duke was so struck with\r\nhis manner and conversation that he resolved to cultivate his\r\nacquaintance. About that time he was in want of a tutor for his two\r\nsons—not for the common purposes of education, but to travel with them.\r\nHe accordingly engaged Lazowski to make the tour of France with these\r\nlads, the Count de la Rochefoucault and the Count Alexander de la\r\nRochefoucault. The Duke thought it an important part of education to\r\nbecome well acquainted with their own country. During two years they\r\ntravelled over the greatest part of the kingdom on horseback. The Duke\r\nwas so well pleased with the conduct of Lazowski on this journey that,\r\nhaving determined to send his sons to England in order to acquire the\r\nlanguage of that country, and, generally, in compliance with the\r\nAnglomania which then reigned in France, he continued Lazowski in his\r\nsituation and sent them all three to England. Among other objects in\r\nFrance, Lazowski had given some attention to agriculture, particularly\r\nin its connection with political economy. On his arrival in London he\r\nmade enquiry who could most probably give him information relative to\r\nagriculture, manufactures, commerce and other national objects. Among\r\nothers I was named to him by some person who was so partial in his\r\nrepresentations that he at once determined to fix at Bury for a short\r\ntime, which he understood was the nearest town to my country residence.\r\nHe and the two young men went to the Angel Inn, from thence hired\r\nconvenient apartments, and enquired where I resided. At that time I was\r\nabsent, and Mr. Symonds, understanding that two young men of fashion\r\nfrom France were at Bury, introduced himself and showed them various\r\ncivilities, and when I returned brought them over to Bradfield. From\r\nthat time a friendship between me and Lazowski commenced, and lasted\r\ntill the death of the latter. He was about forty years of age, and in\r\nevery respect a most agreeable companion. He soon made rapid progress in\r\nthe English language, which he spoke not only with fluency, but often\r\nwith extreme wittiness. There was not in his mind any strong predominant\r\ncast; but the grace and facility of his manner, with suavity of temper,\r\nmade him a great favourite, and being also highly elegant and refined,\r\nhe often produced impressions which were not easily effaced. From his\r\ngeneral conversation in mixed society it was not readily concluded that\r\nhe could or would attend with great industry and perseverance to objects\r\nof importance. But this would have been erroneous, for he exerted the\r\ngreatest industry in making himself a master of all those circumstances\r\nwhich mark the basis of national prosperity, and he formed in his own\r\nmind a very correct comparison of the resources both of Britain and\r\nFrance. He often expressed to me much surprise at what he thought on\r\nthis subject in England, and declared that the ignorance of the French\r\nrelative to their great rival was most profound. The Duke of Liancourt\r\nwas highly gratified by his correspondence, and after he had resided\r\nsome time, first at Bury and afterwards with Mr. Symonds, he was\r\ndirected to take the young men a tour through England and Scotland,\r\nwhich he did. The Duke himself came over on a visit to Symonds while his\r\nsons and their tutor were in the house. Soon after his arrival in\r\nEngland, hearing that there were such carriages at Bury as were called\r\nbuggies, and desiring to make use of all sorts, he ordered one to be\r\nhired to convey him and Lazowski to Bradfield. On its coming to the\r\ndoor, Lazowski perceiving that, though it was drawn by one horse only,\r\nit ran upon the quarter,[92] he would have persuaded the Duke not to\r\nattempt driving, as it would be 20 to 1 that he would overthrow it; but\r\nthe Duke, full of presumption, held such prudential advice in contempt,\r\nand, whipping away, had not gone half a mile in a cross road before he\r\noverturned the carriage, and in the fall dislocated his shoulder. The\r\nDuke was conveyed to Symonds. Lazowski instantly rode off to inform me\r\nof the accident, and the Duke expressed no more desire to drive\r\ncarriages he had never seen. Lazowski’s connection with the Duke was not\r\nput an end to when the education of his sons was finished; he was so\r\nuseful that he continued his salary and an apartment in the Hôtel de la\r\nRochefoucauld, Paris, and I often admired the independent spirit with\r\nwhich he lived in the family. A dinner did not often pass without an\r\nargument between him and the Duke, which was carried on with a great\r\ndeal of heat on both sides. On such occasions Lazowski never gave up the\r\nshadow of an opinion, and being gifted with more natural fluency than\r\nthe Duke, he had usually the better of the argument. This was equally to\r\nthe credit of both. His employment was chiefly drawing up memorials upon\r\npolitical subjects for the Duke’s information, who was a vain man, and,\r\nwithout doubt, figured in conversation by this subsidiary assistance.\r\nHis vanity appeared in one circumstance in which he attempted much more\r\nthan he could perform. While he was in the bath, or dressing by his\r\n_valet de chambre_, he had three secretaries, to whom he pretended to\r\ndictate at the same time. One of them told Lazowski that it was scarcely\r\ncredible how they were fatigued by his incessant blunders. Yet in\r\nFrance, perhaps, this very attempt gave a sort of reputation. It was\r\nsuspected that he merely attempted this in imitation of Cæsar, who did\r\nthe same thing, but in a very different manner, it is presumed, from the\r\nD. de Liancourt. With a view similar to that of retaining Lazowski, he\r\ngave an apartment to Jarré, an officer who had long been in the Russian\r\nservice, and afterwards became famous for burning the suburbs of\r\nCourtray. He was well known in England as General Jarré, and placed at\r\nthe head of the Military Asylum at Wycombe. While I was in France, M.\r\nJarré published an octavo volume under the title of ‘Crédit National,’ a\r\nwhimsical work, in which the arguments were very ill supported. Lazowski\r\nalways showed me great friendliness, and I returned it with great\r\nconstancy and truth. Among all the men I met with in France, attached to\r\nthe higher classes or constituting them, all were infidels, and poor\r\nLazowski of the number. He never lost himself so completely as when he\r\nentered into an argument upon the truth of Christianity with the Bishop\r\nof Llandaff, for, though civilly done, the Bishop ground him to powder.\r\nThe latter, of course, thought him nothing but a frothy Frenchman, like\r\nmost of his countrymen, with Voltaire in his head and the devil in his\r\nheart, all of whom would have talked the same language had they had the\r\nsame opportunity. Before Lazowski and his pupils had learnt English,\r\nSymonds took them to Cambridge, and introduced them to the Bishop, who,\r\nunderstanding that the young men were of high rank in France, and\r\nknowing that he spoke French himself with difficulty, put on his\r\ncanonicals to receive his foreign guests, and, entering the room with a\r\nmost stately air, addressed them all in Latin, hinting to Symonds the\r\npropriety, as Latin was the language of that learned University, and,\r\ntherefore, in using it he was classically right. The Frenchmen, of\r\ncourse, replied with plenty of bows and grimaces to every learned\r\nsentence rolled out in most majestic tone from the Bishop’s mouth, but\r\ngiving no other answer. The Bishop was at last compelled to address them\r\nin his broken French: ‘Latin, gentlemen, is our language here, but\r\nperhaps you had rather I should speak in bad French than not use that\r\nlanguage at all!’ and then relaxing his episcopal dignity, he conversed\r\nwith them at ease and quieted their ruffled spirits.\r\n\r\n1784.—This year I took a journey with my son for farming intelligence\r\ninto Essex and Kent, &c., and, being at Dover, we went over to Calais\r\njust to enable us to say that we had been in France. But I had another\r\nmotive, which was to see M. Mouron, and the capital improvements that\r\ngentleman had made near Calais. We lived three or four days at Dessein’s\r\ncelebrated inn. M. Mouron not only showed me his great farm, but\r\nexplained to me every circumstance of the improvements, which I printed\r\nin the ‘Annals.’ Some years before the Empress Catherine had sent over\r\nseven or eight young men to learn practical agriculture, two or three of\r\nwhom were fixed with my friend Arbuthnot, and others in different parts\r\nof the Kingdom. They were under the superintendence of the Rev. Mr.\r\nSambosky, who wrote to me at Bradfield earnestly requesting that I would\r\ngo to London and examine all the young men, that he might take or send\r\nthem to St. Petersburg. This I accordingly did, and examined them very\r\nclosely, except one, who refused to answer any questions from a\r\nconviction of his absolute ignorance. I gave a certificate of the\r\nothers’ examination, and I asked Sambosky what would become of the\r\nobstinate fool who would not answer. He replied that without doubt he\r\nwould be sent to Siberia for life, but I never heard whether this\r\nhappened. One of them, by much the ablest, remained in England, and\r\nbecame in time Chaplain to the Russian Embassy, in which situation he is\r\nat the present time, and held in general esteem. The intended\r\nestablishment of an Imperial farm never took place, and after at least\r\nan expenditure of 10,000_l._, the men on their arrival were turned\r\nloose, some to starve, some driven into the army, and others retained by\r\nRussian noblemen. In this wretched and ridiculous manner did the whole\r\nscheme end, which, under a proper arrangement, might have been attended\r\nwith very important effects. Prince Potemkin, one of the first noblemen\r\nin the Russian Empire, must have been animated with truly liberal and\r\nenlarged ideas, or he would not now have sent three young men to learn\r\npractical agriculture. It gave me the greatest pleasure to be able to\r\npromote their enquiries during a part of their residence here.\r\n\r\n1785.—This year I wrote a note in the ‘Annals’ relative to a great work\r\nI had long been engaged in, which it may not be here amiss to insert,\r\nviz.: to collect, under regular heads, all the well-ascertained facts\r\nthat are scattered through books of agriculture, and, _inter alia_, in\r\nother works, with those to be deduced from the common practice of\r\nvarious countries; to interweave experiments made purposely to ascertain\r\nthe doubtful points; and to combine the whole into regular elements of\r\nthe Science is the great desideratum at present. It is a work more\r\nproper for an Academy on a Royal foundation than for any individual. But\r\nas no such Academy is to be looked for, and as all private societies pay\r\ntheir attention to desultory objects, as often to those already\r\nascertained as to points in which we want information the most, I\r\nundertook the work myself more than ten years ago.[93]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRADFIELD HALL AS IN ARTHUR YOUNG’S TIME.]\r\n\r\nI had this year the misfortune to lose my mother, to whom I was most\r\ntenderly attached, and with the greatest reason, as her kindness and\r\naffection for me had never failed during the course of her whole life.\r\nShe had been educated in the most religious manner by her father, Mr. de\r\nCousmaker, of whom mention has already been made as a character\r\neminently pious, but it was not till the loss of my sister, Mrs.\r\nTomlinson, that deep affliction recalled in her heart those sentiments\r\nof religion which had been so assiduously cultivated in her youth. She\r\nwas always extremely fond of me, and ever eager to do what could\r\ncontribute to my satisfaction, both as to worldly views, but especially\r\nas to my eternal interests.\r\n\r\nThe tranquil bosom of my good mother’s hermitage—my native\r\nBradfield—once more opened its arms to receive us, little more than to\r\ncome to close the eye and receive the last signs of that beloved parent.\r\nBlessed spirit!—may my hitherto restless days finish as thine did, who\r\ndidst meet death with the tranquillity of a healthy life, and mightst\r\nhave said with as much justice as an Addison, ‘See with what peace a\r\nChristian can die.’\r\n\r\nUpon her death this patch of landed property[94] devolved to me by a\r\nprevious agreement with my elder brother, and by my mother’s will,\r\nwritten at his desire with his own hand. But that agreement before it\r\nterminated cost me a mortgage of 1,200_l._ The transaction does my\r\nbrother’s memory too much honour not to mention it. He was entitled to\r\n2,000_l._, but knowing the smallness of the property, and humanely\r\nconsidering that I had a family unprovided for, that he had an ample\r\nincome and no family at all, he generously demanded and took no more\r\nthan 1,200_l._ Whether such things happen among relations or strangers,\r\nthey should be mentioned for the credit of the human heart.\r\n\r\nMy correspondence this year was, upon the whole, interesting, as a few\r\nof the letters will show. From the Earl of Bristol, a panegyric on\r\nagriculture; another from the same, an animated defence of the\r\nPresbyterians.\r\n\r\n                                ‘Downhill, Coleraine: Jan. 15, 1785.\r\n\r\n  ‘My dear Arthur,—I am mortified, and should really be ashamed to see\r\n  your entertaining letter so long unanswered, but that the\r\n  multiplicity, as well as variety of my occupations, bereave me\r\n  sometimes of the most pleasing ones; from sunrise to long after sunset\r\n  I am not a moment idle, either in mind or person, and I can venture to\r\n  assure you that agriculture, being the basis of all public and private\r\n  virtues, as it banishes laziness, fortifies the body, leads to fair\r\n  and honest procreation, provides sustenance and multiplies the\r\n  tenderest and most endearing ties in nature, has no little share both\r\n  of my time and attention. Let one hundred and fifty men daily employed\r\n  verify my assertion; let the rocks which disappear and the grass which\r\n  succeeds to them corroborate that evidence. But, then, what have I to\r\n  do with the English plough? Neither our soil, nor our climate, nor our\r\n  labourers are the same; we are poor and you are rich; when industry\r\n  has approximated a little of our wealth to yours perhaps we may be\r\n  tempted to adopt your luxury in agriculture, unless before that you\r\n  shall have discovered your errors and so saved us the trouble of\r\n  retracting what we have not had time to adopt.\r\n\r\n  ‘As to my Presbyterians, I am glad you are modest enough not to\r\n  censure those, whom you are honest enough to confess you do not know;\r\n  all the harm which I find in them is that they love the rights of\r\n  mankind, and if in pursuing them for themselves they refuse to\r\n  participate with their fellow citizens, I would join in your\r\n  execrations, and set them a better example than hitherto they have\r\n  received from our church. Adieu! let me hear from you sometimes when\r\n  you have nothing better to do, and tell Symonds, with my affectionate\r\n  compliments, that I have recovered my lost map of the Pontine marshes,\r\n  and will send it by the first opportunity. If you ever see the learned\r\n  and good-humoured Rector (Reverend George Ashby) don’t let him forget\r\n\r\n                                        ‘Your affectionate friend,\r\n                                                          ‘BRISTOL.’\r\n\r\n                                ‘Downhill, Coleraine: March 9, 1785.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Arthur,—I have but just received yours of the 19th, and though I\r\n  do not think my letters worth paying for, yet since you do, and I have\r\n  a leisure half hour, have at you. And in this duel of our pens, who\r\n  would expect a Bishop of the Established Church to be an advocate for\r\n  the anti-Episcopal Schismatics, called Presbyterians, whilst a man\r\n  whose religion lies in his plough and his garden, that is, with the\r\n  Goddess of the one and with the God of the other, to be so zealous an\r\n  opponent? My defence rests principally on this point, that they have\r\n  as good a right to differ from me as my ancestors from our joint\r\n  ancestors, or the Church established above twelve hundred years\r\n  before.\r\n\r\n  ‘As to their political principles, I think them, from their system of\r\n  parity, and from their practice in most parts of Europe, infinitely\r\n  more favourable to political liberty than ours.\r\n\r\n  ‘Witness Germany and Switzerland and the short reign of _Old Nol._\r\n\r\n  ‘You say, “But their political principles never became powerfully\r\n  active without involving their country in a civil war.” And are there\r\n  not two words to that bargain, and does not the _pot_ call the\r\n  _kettle_, &c. &c.?[95] You might as well object the same to all good\r\n  citizens when oppressed by bad ones; you may as well object the same\r\n  to the first Brutus and to the second; you may as well object it to\r\n  Luther and Melanchthon. Did the Presbyterians ask anything\r\n  unreasonable when they desired to have _their_ nonsense tolerated as\r\n  well as other nonsense? for if it be nonsense ’tis paying _it_ too\r\n  great a compliment, and ourselves too bad a one, to persecute it; and\r\n  if it be good sense, surely, for one’s own sake, as well as that of\r\n  our neighbours, it deserves a better reception than persecution.\r\n\r\n  ‘When I see Switzerland and Germany pacified for above 150 years,\r\n  after throat-cutting for 140, by the single means of a reciprocal\r\n  toleration, and by the Pacta Conventa of 1648,[96] which allowed them\r\n  to share those loaves and fishes alternately monopolised by each\r\n  party, I must confess, if I were Frederick the First of Oceana, or of\r\n  Atlantis, I should not hesitate to begin my reign with that system\r\n  with which most sovereigns are compelled to close theirs! The rights\r\n  of humanity, dear Arthur, the rights of humanity form a great article\r\n  in my creed, and that religion, or sect of religion, which can teach\r\n  otherwise may come from below, but surely did not descend from above.\r\n\r\n  ‘Believe me, our whirlwind is not past, perhaps ’tis only just\r\n  beginning; yet three hundred labourers with their spades fill my\r\n  mind’s eye with as pleasing and as satisfactory ideas as the whole\r\n  Coleraine Battalion with their muskets before my door. If in this\r\n  whirlwind _I_ can direct the storm, so much the better for humanity,\r\n  but not for the lank-haired Divinity, nor the frizzle-topped Divinity,\r\n  nor the hocus-pocus Divinity.\r\n\r\n  ‘I love agriculture because it makes good citizens, good husbands,\r\n  good fathers, good children; because it does not leave a man time to\r\n  plunder his neighbour, and because by its plenty it bereaves him of\r\n  the temptation; and I hate an aristocratical Government because it\r\n  plunders these honest fellows; because it is idle; it is insolent; it\r\n  values itself on the merits of it, and because, like an overbearing\r\n  torrent, the farther it is removed from its fountain head, and the\r\n  less it partakes of its original purity, the more desolation it\r\n  carries with it; and because, like a stinking, stagnated pool, it\r\n  inflicts those very disorders which it was the chief merit of its\r\n  spring and fountain head to heal and remove.\r\n\r\n                                      ‘Adieu.\r\n                                          ‘Ever affectionately,\r\n                                                          ‘BRISTOL.’\r\n\r\nMy brother, the Rev. Dr. Young, Fellow of Eton College, in this letter\r\ninforms me that the King reads my ‘Annals’ and is much pleased with\r\nthem, and highly approves of my arguments to show that we are far enough\r\nfrom being in a ruined state.\r\n\r\n                                         ‘Eton College: May 1, 1785.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Arthur,—I have two of your letters to answer; the latter\r\n  directed to Worcester, why, I know not, for I never intended to be\r\n  there till the beginning of next month.

There runs a vein of fancy through your poetry which stamps a high\r\n  character upon it, and would your genius but stoop to the minutiæ of\r\n  correctness would raise you to an exalted rank in that line. Whether\r\n  you will approve my alterations or not I cannot tell, but it would be\r\n  difficult to point out more inaccuracies in the poem. You obliged me\r\n  much by your introductory number. I had sent for one before, with a\r\n  view to lend it to my friends and to engage them to become purchasers\r\n  of the work.

Let me, however, hear\r\n  from you as often as you can.\r\n\r\n                                                     ‘Adieu.\r\n                                                         ‘R. VALPY.’\r\n\r\nI find by memoranda that I was busied in the imagination of new\r\nfish-ponds,[99] taking lively interest in and examining how much of the\r\nlow meadow at Bradfield could be laid under water. What led me to this\r\nfolly is not easy to conceive, because I could have afforded to attempt\r\nthe making of an ocean as much as of a pond; but how often is the\r\nregister of a life the register of human folly?\r\n\r\nI was (this year) elected an honorary member of the Royal Society of\r\nAgriculture of Paris.[100] About this time I went on a farming journey\r\nto the Bakewells,[101] in Leicestershire; it was a very instructive\r\njourney and in which I gained a great deal of valuable information. I\r\nalso spent several days about this time with Lord Townshend[102] at\r\nRainham and his uncommonly agreeable young wife, equally elegant and\r\nbeautiful. During my visit I had an ample opportunity of admiring the\r\nnoble picture of Belisarius by Salvator Rosa, a performance which can\r\nnever be too highly commended. With the agreeableness of this noble\r\nfamily, and especially of Lady Townshend, I rendered my visit extremely\r\npleasing.\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord, to whose liberal attention I owe much information, came\r\nto his estate in so high a degree of cultivation, owing to the\r\nunrivalled exertions of his grandfather, that little was left for him to\r\nperform; a life of great activity and service, had the situation of his\r\nproperty been different, would not have allowed a minute’s attention.\r\nThese notes will, however, show that Lord Townshend has not been idle at\r\nRainham.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival there I was anxious to view that part of the estate\r\nchiefly near the house, which was improved by a man who quitted all the\r\npower and lustre of a Court for the amusements of agriculture.\r\n\r\nCharles, Lord Viscount Townshend, who was Ambassador Extraordinary to\r\nthe States General in 1709, a Lord of the Regency on the death of Queen\r\nAnne, Knight of the Garter, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, twice Secretary\r\nof State, and Lord President of the Council, resigned the seals in May\r\n1730, and, as he died in 1738, it is probable that this period of eight\r\nyears was that of his improvements round Rainham.\r\n\r\nThe Irish propositions[103] which were at this time under the\r\nconsideration of Government meeting with many unforeseen difficulties, I\r\nhad a letter from Mr. Rose requesting information relative to the\r\ncomparative circumstances of the two kingdoms, and Mr. Pitt thought the\r\ninformation so much to the purpose that he desired Mr. Rose to write to\r\nme requesting my attendance in town. I accordingly went, and gave Mr.\r\nPitt the information he wished, at the same time answering an abundance\r\nof collateral enquiries, for which I received a formal letter of thanks.\r\nMy correspondence with Mr. Rose recurred several times after these\r\ninterviews. In his third letter he requested to be informed of the\r\namount of a labourer’s consumption of taxed commodities, in order to\r\nascertain what excises and other taxes such consumption supports. ‘I\r\nconceive,’ he wrote, ‘that the articles consumed by that description of\r\npeople are leather, candles, soap, beer, probably some spirits, and\r\nperhaps a small quantity of starch. I wish also very much to know what\r\ntheir chief diet is, and the price of the articles in the different\r\nparts of the country.’[104]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  ‘My lovely Bobbin’—christened Martha Ann—the adored child whose loss\r\n  at the age of fourteen was the great sorrow of Arthur Young’s life.\r\n  The pet name of ‘Bobbin’ originated in that of ‘Robin,’ which the\r\n  child gave herself but could not pronounce.\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  Dr. J.

He was in the habit of hunting with the King,\r\nand having heard of a very fine hunter to be sold in Herefordshire, he\r\nsent his servant to purchase him. It was the end of the season, but the\r\nKing appointing one day more for the sport, Dr. Young determined to try\r\nhis new horse, and he went in company with another gentleman to the\r\nfield. His friend observed to him that his horse tripped in an odd\r\nmanner, to which Dr. Y. replied: ‘It is the last day of hunting, and I\r\nshall see how he performs.’ ‘Take care,’ said the other, ‘that it is not\r\nthe last day of your life.’ He persisted in the trial, and was for a\r\ntime much pleased with his horse in several leaps; in taking another it\r\nstruck its own legs against an obstruction, threw his rider, whose neck\r\nwas instantly broken. He was taken up dead and carried home. Thus died\r\nmy nearest relative, who was a man of very peculiar talents and of most\r\nsingular originality of character. He had a great deal of eccentric wit,\r\nand was extremely beloved by many intimate friends, amongst whom were\r\nseveral of the Townshends, Cornwallises, and the Duke of Grafton, with\r\nwhom he was on the most intimate terms, and was a great favourite of the\r\nDuchess. Cornwallis, Archbishop of Canterbury, valued him so much for\r\nhis rectitude of conduct in this that he determined to promote him to\r\nthe best preferment that should fall in his gift, and I have several\r\nletters from him repeating this intention. Thus ended a life that\r\npromised so many advantages, for he was high in favour with the King,\r\nwho was pleased not only frequently to converse with him, but to ask his\r\nopinion respecting many sermons which were at that time published. Thus\r\nhigh in expectation of further promotion, to lose his life in so\r\nunexpected and sudden a manner was indeed singularly awful and\r\nunfortunate. It was a dreadful blow also to all my son’s hopes, for as\r\nhe was educating at Eton for the Church, my brother, who had his turn as\r\nFellow of Eton and Prebendary of Worcester in about seventy pieces of\r\npreferment, and had passed all by that came to give away, stood high in\r\nthe lists purposely with a view of promoting Arthur.[105] There was in\r\nDr. Young a steady rectitude of principle, an absolute abhorrence of\r\nevery mean and unworthy action, great natural parts, and as he had been\r\nCaptain (I think), or very near it, of Eton School, he went to King’s at\r\nCambridge a capital scholar.\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote relative to my brother I copy from a letter to my\r\nwife, written by my old friend Professor Symonds:—\r\n\r\n  ‘I assure you, Madam, that I was really at a loss to conjecture\r\n  whether you were in earnest or not when you desired an answer to your\r\n  letter; but in case you were in earnest (which I can now hardly think,\r\n  since the question might be answered better in conversation), you must\r\n  be surprised and offended by my neglect; but I defy you to have been\r\n  more surprised than you will be at my charging your husband with this\r\n  letter. I concealed from him the purport of it, but judged it\r\n  necessary to inform him that there was not the shadow of an intrigue\r\n  between us.\r\n\r\n  ‘So far the prologue; now for the anecdote, which is just as\r\n  interesting as thousands are which are daily propagated. It was about\r\n  two years before the divorce of the Duchess of Grafton that her Grace\r\n  and Lord March played at “brag” for two or three hours one evening at\r\n  Euston; the others—viz. the Duke and Mr. Vary and Jack Young—looked\r\n  over without playing at all. Lord M. had been very forward in\r\n  “bragging,” but threw up his cards afterwards when he had three\r\n  knaves, whether he had a presentiment that the Duchess had three aces\r\n  or whether he had artfully seen her hand. This cowardice struck Jack\r\n  Young so sensibly that he fixed his eyes very sternly on Lord M., and\r\n  addressed him thus: \"Why! March, thou art the most dunghill Scots’\r\n  peer that I ever met with.\" His Lordship instantly arose from his\r\n  chair, filled with indignation, and whilst he was wavering whether he\r\n  should use a poker or some other instrument, the Duke said to him: “I\r\n  find, Lord March, that my friend Jack Young treats you as he\r\n  constantly treats my wife and me.” This prudent and good-natured\r\n  interference disarmed Lord M., and they all passed the evening\r\n  pleasantly. You may depend upon the truth of this story, as I had it\r\n  from Mr. Vary.\r\n\r\n                               ‘I remain, dear Madam\r\n                                                 ‘Yours, &c. &c.,\r\n                                                       ‘J. SYMONDS.’\r\n\r\nThe next anecdote was considered at the time by all who heard it to\r\nredound to the credit of my brother. In one of his visits to Euston he\r\narrived unexpectedly and late in the afternoon, and immediately went to\r\nthe room always appropriated to him to dress for dinner, and thence\r\nproceeded directly into the dining-room, when, to his astonishment, he\r\nperceived sitting at the head of the table the notorious Nancy Parsons\r\ninstead of the Duchess. He instantly drew back, at the same moment\r\nextending his arms to mark his astonishment. The Duke went up to him\r\nwith a conciliatory air, took his arm and said: ‘Come, come, Jack, these\r\nthings are always done in a hurry without consideration. I had no time\r\nto make alterations or inform you. I will explain afterwards.’ But he\r\nonly answered with a shake of his head, and, shrugging up his huge\r\nshoulders, retired, mounted his horse, and reached Bradfield the same\r\nnight, a distance of nearly fifteen miles.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered at this time the Duke was Prime Minister and the\r\nDoctor looking up to him for further preferment. By this he lost a\r\nbishopric.\r\n\r\nI was at Bradfield, and received an express[106] from Dr. Roberts,\r\nProvost of Eton, to inform me of the accident, which called me thither\r\nat once. I resided there some time on account of my brother’s affairs,\r\ndining every day with the Provost and Fellows. On the same account I was\r\nobliged to go to Worcester, where he was a Prebendary and Rector of St.\r\nJohn’s in that city. Dr. Y. died without a will, as he had often told me\r\nhe would do. When all his affairs were settled I returned to Bradfield.\r\nSo sudden and dreadful an accident affected me deeply; there is\r\nsomething in such deaths that strikes every feeling of the soul. In the\r\nmidst of the rapid movements of that animated amusement, in one moment\r\nto be hurried into another world without one thought of preparation has\r\nsomething tremendously formidable in it; yet every one is liable to\r\ndeaths equally sudden, and the suggestion ought to be universal:\r\n‘Prepare to meet thy God.’ The misery is that thousands sitting in their\r\nchairs and with ample time for preparation are apt to think of any\r\nsubject rather than this most important of all.\r\n\r\n                                  _l._\r\n\r\n                    [No date, but evidently written at this period.]\r\n\r\n  ‘As I should be sorry to keep from you anything that must give you\r\n  pleasure in your welfare of your children, I shall report a\r\n  conversation with Dr. Langford, the under-master, who my brother got\r\n  the Prebendary of Worcester for by speaking to Lord Sidney.\r\n\r\n  ‘On his calling on me I lamented the loss—in which he joined\r\n  warmly—spoke highly of my brother as his friend. I said that my bosom\r\n  had all the feelings of affection for him, but that the loss to my\r\n  poor boy was nothing short of ruin. He had no friend left. “No,”\r\n  replied he, \"don’t say that, for give me leave to say that, feeling as\r\n  I do the obligations I have been under to Dr. Young, I must be allowed\r\n  to call myself his friend. If I succeed in life I will be a friend to\r\n  him, and I hope his progress in his learning will permit me to be so.\"\r\n  He said more to the same purpose, and as he is a rising man in a\r\n  situation that gives him power to act according to his feelings, I\r\n  hope he will remember it. But the account Mr. Heath gives me is by no\r\n  means satisfactory, and sorry I am to say that Arthur seems determined\r\n  to do little for himself. He is now at a crisis, and sinks or swims. I\r\n  gave Mr. Heath three guineas that he might encourage him with a crown\r\n  now and then (as from himself) when he did well, but don’t write of\r\n  that to him, and desired him to write me when he was negligent. My\r\n  brother’s affairs turn out very badly; bills to the amount of 360_l._\r\n  now lie unpaid before me here, besides Worcester, and I can see no\r\n  more than 260_l._ to pay it. I hear a bad account of the Rectory at\r\n  Worcester, but suspend all judgment till the whole is before me.\r\n\r\n                                                             ‘A. Y.’\r\n\r\nTwo honours were this year added to my name, by being elected into the\r\nPatriotic Society of Milan and that of the Geographical Society of\r\nFlorence. I had also a visit from a Polish nobleman, Count Kalaskowski,\r\nwho spent some time with me at Bradfield. The letters I received this\r\nyear were numerous, and many of them very interesting. From the number I\r\nhave selected the following:—\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Dr. Burney, on reading my ‘Annals’ and a character of Handel. This\r\nwas after he had been at Bradfield.\r\n\r\n                                                    ‘August 1, 1786.\r\n\r\n  ‘What have I without an inch of land to do with farming? Is it the\r\n  subject or manner of treating it, or both that fascinated me, when you\r\n  first were so kind, my dear friend, as to send me some of your \"Annals\r\n  of Agriculture\"? I was in the midst of my winter’s hurricane and\r\n  immersed in other pursuits, but now, having conversed with some of\r\n  your correspondents, seen your farm, and rubbed up my old rusticity,\r\n  all my love for country matters returns, and I sincerely wish myself a\r\n  villager. You seem to have worked yourself up to a true pitch of\r\n  patriotism, and I think, besides the instructions the essays convey,\r\n  that your knowledge on the subject, and animated reasoning, and\r\n  admonitions, must have a national effect. Your book fastened on me so\r\n  much on the road that I hardly looked on anything else. Mr. Symonds’\r\n  essays on “Italian Husbandry”[107] are extremely curious, and furnish\r\n  a species of information totally different from what can be acquired\r\n  from the perusal of any other author. Many of the communications in\r\n  the three first volumes, of which I have almost read every word, seem\r\n  to me instructive, amusing, and masterly. My countryman, Mr. Harris,\r\n  of Hanwood, in Shropshire (the birthplace of my father and\r\n  grandfather), seems a notable planter. As editor and chief of the\r\n  _Agricola_ family, I think you merit the thanks of every Englishman,\r\n  not only who loves his country, but who loves his _belly_, for if your\r\n  discoveries, improvements, and instructions are followed, we may\r\n  certainly always find upon our own island _de quoi manger_.\r\n\r\n  ‘Now I would not have you, my dear Arthur, put contempt upon my\r\n  praises, as coming from a Londoner, whom you may regard as a mere\r\n  Cock-neigh immersed in the vanities, follies, and dissipation of the\r\n  Capital, for then I’d have you to know that I reckon myself a\r\n  countryman born and bred as much as yourself. I never was within the\r\n  smell of sweet London till I was eighteen, and then, you know, I lived\r\n  during nine of the best years of my life in Norfolk among the best\r\n  farmers in Europe. Indeed, if I were ten or a dozen years younger than\r\n  I am, I believe I should take your white house and all the land about\r\n  it you could spare, and enter myself for your scholar, and run for the\r\n  give and take plate; you know that I have been _giving_ lessons all my\r\n  life; it is now high time I should take some. As to London, if it were\r\n  not for a few friends whom I sincerely love, and for its vicinity to\r\n  several branches of my family, I would take half a crown never to see\r\n  its sights or hear its sounds again.\r\n\r\n  ‘My friend, honest Arthur, who is a very ingenious, good-natured lad,\r\n  will deliver to you a copy of my account of the “Commemoration of\r\n  Handel;” it is not so good a one as I wish to send, though the best in\r\n  my possession. I beg when you have nothing better to do that you will\r\n  read it without too strong prejudices against Old Handel; for though\r\n  he is called a Goth by fine travelled gentlemen, accustomed to more\r\n  modern music and to posthumous refinements, yet candour and true\r\n  knowledge must allow that he was the greatest man of his time, and\r\n  that he had a force and majesty that suited our national character,\r\n  and when you look at the list of his works you will allow that his\r\n  resources were wonderful. His own performance on the organ was perhaps\r\n  more superior than that of any inhabitant of this country, even than\r\n  his compositions. Upon the whole, though I am far from wishing to put\r\n  an extinguisher upon every other candidate for musical fame, yet it\r\n  would be the height of injustice not to allow that this country was\r\n  much obliged to his genius and talent, and that the late performances\r\n  of his productions do honour to the cultivation of musick in this\r\n  kingdom, as well as to our national gratitude.\r\n\r\n  ‘I beg you will present my affectionate compliments to Mrs. Young, and\r\n  best thanks for the hospitality and kindness with which she treated us\r\n  at Bradfield; and pray give our hearty love to the gentle, sweet, and\r\n  amiable Miss Bessy.\r\n\r\n  ‘And believe me to be, with very sincere regard,\r\n\r\n                                        ‘Your affectionate\r\n                                                   ‘CHARLES BURNEY.’\r\n\r\nFrom John Symonds, Esq., on the examination of the boys at Greenwich\r\nSchool for speaking Latin. Gold medal &c. given to master and boys. [A\r\ncurious letter.]\r\n\r\n                                  ‘St. Edmund’s Hill: December 1786.\r\n\r\n  ‘My dearest Friend,—I returned hither yesterday, and shall go to\r\n  Euston on Thursday to pass five or six days there. The Bishop of\r\n  Peterborough will return with me, but whether on Wednesday or Thursday\r\n  se’nnight I know not, but I will send you a line soon after I get\r\n  there, and I hope you will keep yourself free from engagements those\r\n  two days. You may possibly have seen or heard of a remarkable\r\n  circumstance that does equal honour to the Society of Arts and to\r\n  Greenwich School.\r\n\r\n  ‘The Society decreed a gold medal to that schoolmaster who should\r\n  teach his boys to speak the best Latin. This was claimed last week by\r\n  the schoolmaster of Greenwich.[108] Sir William Fordyce and my friend\r\n  Professor Martin were appointed Examiners. More, the Secretary,\r\n  requested Bishop Watson to attend, who excused himself, as he was\r\n  obliged shortly to leave London. Five boys attended with their master.\r\n  The Examiners had prepared a great number of questions such as boys\r\n  maybe supposed to understand. These were put in Latin and answered in\r\n  Latin without hesitation. The boys were then ordered to withdraw into\r\n  a private room together, and to make an original composition in Latin\r\n  without the help of a dictionary. This they all performed in half an\r\n  hour. Then the Examiners asked numberless questions in English, which\r\n  were answered immediately in Latin. The gold medal was given to the\r\n  schoolmaster, and five silver ones of equal value to the five boys,\r\n  who were pretty much upon an equality, and what is surprising is that\r\n  not one of the five had learned Latin longer than two years and a\r\n  half, and the eldest of them was not above thirteen years. You may be\r\n  certain that this is true, as I saw it in a letter from Martin to his\r\n  brother-in-law, the Vice-Chancellor, and he concludes it by saying\r\n  “that they all spoke Latin with fluency, propriety, and elegance.”\r\n  Were I possessed but of a small portion of the fire with which you are\r\n  animated, I should cry out with a generous indignation, “Blush, ye\r\n  proud seminaries of Eton and Westminster,” &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\n  ‘My compliments _aux Polonais_.\r\n\r\n  ‘I am now set down in earnest to renew acquaintance with my Italian\r\n  _agricoltori_.\r\n\r\n                                     ‘Ever affectionately,\r\n                                                     ‘JOHN SYMONDS.’\r\n\r\nIn a Westerly Tour I made this year, amongst numerous other places I\r\nvisited Blenheim, and made the following memorandum:—\r\n\r\n  ‘Viewed the pleasure ground at Blenheim, the enclosed part of which\r\n  consists of 200 acres, with the water near 300. It can scarcely be too\r\n  much admired; the whole environ of the water is fine, various in its\r\n  feature, with the character of magnificence everywhere impressed. The\r\n  cascade scenery, viewed independently of the new improvements, is\r\n  extremely pleasing, and indeed wants nothing but a deeper and more\r\n  umbrageous shade for an accompaniment. The new walks, caves,\r\n  fountains, and statues do not, however, seem entirely calculated to\r\n  add to the beauty of the scenery. The most splendid view is from the\r\n  walk leading from the cascade to the house. There are two points\r\n  nearly similar, where are benches; the water fills the bottom of the\r\n  vale in the style of a very noble river; few, indeed, in the kingdom\r\n  exceed it. We may conjecture that if Brown, in the exultation of his\r\n  heart, really said that the Thames would never pardon his superb\r\n  imitation for exceeding the original, it was the view from one of\r\n  these benches that inspired the sentiment. The proud waves that roll\r\n  at your feet; the declivity steep enough to make the water and every\r\n  contiguous scene more interesting to the eye; the opposite shore, a\r\n  hill spread with wood that hangs with forest boldness to the water;\r\n  the whole is formed to make an impression on the mind. No ill-judged\r\n  decoration weakens by dividing the effect; no intruding objects hurt\r\n  the simplicity of the scene. I know not any artificial scene that is\r\n  finer. The concluding one where the water expands is great, but I\r\n  think inferior to this. But to return——\r\n\r\n                                 [_l._]\r\n\r\nIt appears this year[109] that I was engaged in a pursuit entirely new\r\nto me, that of making many new and pneumatic experiments on expelling\r\ngas from soils, manures, and various other substances, in order to\r\nascertain whether there was any connection between the quantity and\r\nspecies of such gas (from _Geist_, German for ghost, spirit. Authority,\r\nB. of Llandaff, _see_ Newman’s ‘Trans. of Boerhave’s Chemistry’) and the\r\nfertility of the soils from which my specimens were selected. It seems\r\nthat I prosecuted this enquiry with diligence; and as it was my\r\ncommencement in chemistry, I corresponded upon the subject with Dr.\r\nPriestley, and went to Cambridge for the conversation of Mr. Milner,\r\nthen Professor of Chemistry in that University. The result of my\r\nexperiments was very remarkable, for I decided, after a very careful\r\ndeduction from the result of all my trials, that there existed a very\r\nintimate, and almost unbroken, connection between the fertility of land\r\nand the gas to be expelled from it. This was an entirely new discovery\r\nbelonging to me only, and it has been quoted by many celebrated chemists\r\nin a manner which showed that they considered me as the origin of it. I\r\nsent a detail of my trials to the Royal Society, through the hands of\r\nMr. Magellan,[110] as my paper contained some eudiometrical experiments\r\nmade with the eudiometer invented by that philosopher. Mentioning to a\r\nfriend what I had done, ‘You have been very foolish,’ observed the\r\nfriend, ‘for depend upon it your paper will never get into the\r\n“Philosophical Transactions.”’ Expressing my surprise, I demanded the\r\nreason. ‘Why, know you not,’ he replied, ‘that there is a most\r\ninveterate hostility between Sir J. Banks and Magellan, from a violent\r\nquarrel, and Sir J. is not a man to permit anything to be printed that\r\ncomes through hands offensive to him, especially as the paper is to the\r\ncredit of Magellan’s instrument?’ The event proved the truth of this\r\nprediction, but this did not prevent my labours being duly appreciated\r\nby those who were the most competent judges. In the pursuit of these\r\ntrials I gradually established and furnished a laboratory, sufficient\r\nfor my own enquiries, at about 150_l._ expense.\r\n\r\n                                  _l._\r\n\r\n                                         ‘Birmingham: Jan. 27, 1783.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—There is no person I should serve with more pleasure than\r\n  you, because there is no person whose pursuits are more eminently\r\n  useful to the world. You alone have certainly done more to promote\r\n  agriculture, and especially to render it reputable, in this country\r\n  than all that have gone before you. But the little I might do to aid\r\n  your investigations will be reduced to a small matter indeed by my\r\n  distance from you.\r\n\r\n  ‘All that I should be able to do with water would be to expel by heat\r\n  all the air it contains, and then examine, by nitrous air, how much\r\n  phlogiston that air contains, but it is very possible that the fitness\r\n  of water for irrigating meadows may depend upon something besides the\r\n  phlogiston it contains. Experiment alone can determine these things. I\r\n  never heard before of the inference, you say, has been drawn from my\r\n  doctrine with respect to the use of light in vegetation. I know of no\r\n  use that light is of to the _soil_. The whole effect is on the _living\r\n  plant_, enabling it to convert the impure air it meets with in water\r\n  or in the atmosphere into pure air. When that end is effected that\r\n  water is of no further use to it. Plants will not thrive unless both\r\n  their leaves and roots be exposed to air in some degrees impure. This\r\n  I have fully ascertained, but I am afraid that the doctrine is not\r\n  capable of much practical application.\r\n\r\n  ‘I know of no method of conveying phlogiston to the roots of plants\r\n  but as combined with water, and this seems to be done in the best way\r\n  by a mixture of putrid matter. Water will not imbibe much inflammable\r\n  air. I find volatile alkali to contain much phlogiston. It is indeed\r\n  almost another modification of the same thing.\r\n\r\n  ‘Since my last, I have hit upon various methods of converting water\r\n  into permanent air. It is sufficient to give it something more than a\r\n  boiling heat. If I only put an ounce of water into a porous earthen\r\n  retort, I get a hundred ounce measures of air from it, and when I\r\n  have, in this manner, got near an ounce weight of air from the same\r\n  retort, it has not weighed one grain less than it did.\r\n\r\n  ‘I shall be glad to hear the result of your experiments, and am truly\r\n  sorry that I can do so little for you.\r\n\r\n                                                     ‘J. PRIESTLEY.’\r\n\r\n                                        ‘Birmingham: March 31, 1783.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—I received from Mr. More[111] two bottles of water, one\r\n  marked Ｘ, which Mr. Boswell informed him was from the spring mentioned\r\n  in his “Treatise on Watering Meadows,” and another without any mark\r\n  from a spring arising in a bed of sand, and I examined them\r\n  immediately. I found the former to contain air much purer than that of\r\n  the atmosphere; but the latter air was much worse, that is,\r\n  phlogisticated; a candle could hardly have burned in it. This last I\r\n  should think to be the better spring for the watering of meadows, or\r\n  perhaps it might have been better corked; for on the 19th, though I\r\n  put the corks in again immediately, but without any cement, I found\r\n  the air in both very pure, more so than the purest before, and hardly\r\n  to be distinguished, and they were so this day when I examined them\r\n  again. They should be examined on the spot. The air in the spring from\r\n  the sand was much warmer than that in my pump water, or than that of\r\n  water in general. But water exposed to the open air soon loses the\r\n  phlogiston it contains.\r\n\r\n  ‘Perhaps much of the effect of water on meadows is that, at this time\r\n  of the year, it comes out of the earth considerably warmer than the\r\n  roots of the grass. What think you of this?\r\n\r\n  ‘I expect to set out for London this day three weeks, and shall stay\r\n  there about a fortnight. I should be glad to meet you there, when we\r\n  shall find an hour’s conversation better than all our correspondence.\r\n  Wishing you success in all your laudable pursuits.\r\n\r\n                                    ‘I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                              ‘Yours &c. &c.\r\n                                                     ‘J. PRIESTLEY.’\r\n\r\nAt Chadacre, six miles from Bury, resided John Plampin, Esq.[112] who\r\nhad three daughters, all, at this time, unmarried and at home. I was\r\nintimately acquainted with them. Two of these ladies were much\r\ndistinguished by their beauty, and reigned as toasts throughout the\r\ncounty: Sophia married afterwards to the Rev. Mr. Macklin, and Betsy\r\nmarried in 1794 to Orbell Ray Oakes, Esq. of Bury. I introduced my\r\nfriend Lazowski to these ladies, and he was much at Chadacre, admiring\r\nnot a little the youngest of them. They persuaded their father to give a\r\nball, at which the Duke of Liancourt, his two sons, Lazowski and myself\r\nwere present, and the evening passed with uncommon hilarity till the\r\nrising sun sent us home. Mr. Symonds afterwards gave a weekly ball when\r\nthe Frenchmen were with him, and these parties were uncommonly\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1787 I received a letter from a friend at Paris,\r\nMons. Lazowski (who had resided two years at Bury, much to my amusement\r\nand satisfaction, with the two sons of the Duke of Liancourt), to inform\r\nme that he was going with the Count de la Rochefoucault to the Pyrenees,\r\nand proposed my being of the party.[113]\r\n\r\n                                          ‘Liancourt: April 9, 1787.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—I was at Liancourt when I heard from you the last time, so\r\n  that I was very uneasy upon the bill which you had drawn upon M. de\r\n  Vergennes, who could not be informed by me about it, but very happily\r\n  my letter to him went at a proper time, and it has been paid. Nothing\r\n  wants now but to have turnips, as your English wit whispers it. But we\r\n  have another matter to settle together, if you are not now incumbered.\r\n  I told you by the last that it could be, but I would travel this\r\n  summer. The case is that the Count is, for the sake of his health,\r\n  obliged to go to Bagnères-de-Luchon, in the Pyrénées, to drink those\r\n  waters; he asked from me to be his companion, and his relations seemed\r\n  to be glad of it. I did therefore comply with his demand, and we are\r\n  going about the middle of May, which is the time just of your coming\r\n  over to France. Now will you come with us? Such proposition is not a\r\n  foolish one. We will pass by a part of France in going, and come back\r\n  by another part, so that you will see almost the two-thirds of this\r\n  kingdom. You will learn the French; with us everything will be\r\n  explained to you; in short, I will be with you, and that is enough, I\r\n  hope. That part by which you will pass through is not an uninteresting\r\n  one. Look upon a map. You will pass through the Limousin and Toulouse\r\n  in going, and in coming back by Bordeaux, &c.; the Pyrénées are very\r\n  worth to be seen, and, besides, if nothing very extraordinary prevents\r\n  it, we intend to go to Barcelona in Spain, in order to see the\r\n  Catalogne,[114] the finest province after that travel. I must not tell\r\n  you that I shall be another Arthur here for you, not that I presume to\r\n  say that you will find in me an Encyclopædia living as I did in you,\r\n  but your friend, and therefore to your commands in Paris and\r\n  everywhere. Our manner of travelling is very convenient to you also;\r\n  we go with our own horses, you will have one, my servants will be\r\n  yours, nothing therefore shall be too much expensive. Have you your\r\n  horse? Is it possible to come over with him at a proper time? If not,\r\n  do write to me a word, and the Count and I will do our utmost to get\r\n  one cheap enough, between fifteen and twenty pounds. If you cannot be\r\n  ready here for the 15th of May, we will expect five or six days, but\r\n  you see that it is impossible to expect more, since the Count must\r\n  drink the waters; in two words, you seemed to wish to see this\r\n  kingdom, never you will have such an opportunity; if I am obliged to\r\n  stay at Bagnères, nothing will prevent you to make some excursions in\r\n  the environs, and you will speak French very well. The whole depends\r\n  of your family business. If you cannot now, then you will wait till\r\n  September, and we will be at Paris; but you must give greatest of\r\n  attention to it, and as soon as your mind will be fixed upon anything\r\n  pray do write to me. What devil are you doing about the notables?\r\n  (_l._) I suppose you know my mind about the whole by my letter.[115]\r\n  M. de Calonne is exiled, so is M. Necker. What will be the result I do\r\n  not know, but the notables have missed the way, and they know nothing\r\n  of the matter; but public business must give way to what I make a\r\n  proposal to you, it is question of nothing else but to travel together\r\n  a thousand miles, without more expense but that you would spend\r\n  anywhere, &c. &c. so you may go to the devil if you don’t speak well\r\n  of me and my prospect. My best compliments to M. Symonds &c. &c.\r\n  chiefly Lady Gage and Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\n                                                    ‘Yours for ever,\r\n                                                               ‘LY.\r\n\r\n  ‘Do not forget to write and to speak about your horse, whether you\r\n  will bring yours, or if we must get one for you.’\r\n\r\nThis was touching a string tremulous to vibrate. I had so long\r\nwished for an opportunity to examine France. In the survey of\r\nagriculture which I had taken in England and Ireland, of about 7,000\r\nmiles, I had calculated, from facts, the rent produce and resources\r\nof those Kingdoms, and I had often reflected on the importance of\r\nknowing the real situation of France; the effect of Government; the\r\nstate of the farmers, of the poor—the state and extent of their\r\nmanufactures with a hundred other enquiries certainly of political\r\nimportance; yet strange as it may seem not to be found in any French\r\nbook written from actual observation, all that I was before able to\r\nlearn having been composed in some great city without travelling\r\nbeyond the walls. I should accept a very unsatisfactory work upon\r\nsheep, written by Mons. Cartier, employed and paid by Government. I\r\nhad but little time given me to consider of the proposal, but I\r\nwrote to learn if they travelled post, because I previously\r\ndetermined in that case not to go. And, further, I requested to know\r\nif I were to travel at any other expense than that of myself and\r\nhorse. The answer was that they travelled with their own horses, and\r\ndid not propose making more than twenty or twenty-five miles a day;\r\nthat my expense would be merely what I stated, and mostly in a cheap\r\npart of the kingdom. This most agreeable plan I instantaneously\r\nacceded to, and soon set out for France on horseback. At Dover,\r\nbeing detained, I copy the following note on that expedition:—\r\n\r\n‘_l._—Had the packet sailed this morn as I expected I should not\r\nhave scaled, as I never did before, Shakespeare’s Cliff. By the way\r\nit is by no means so formidable as I expected from it. I think the\r\nlook down from its perpendicular position very striking, and when I\r\nreflected how much more it must be from the summit, the reflection,\r\nperhaps, injured the principal effect (_l._). This is a proof that\r\nwe ought never, when a powerful impression is wished, to advance to\r\nthe principal point gradually. It should come upon us at once; nor\r\nshould I have seen Mr. Harris’s drill plough,[116] which I liked\r\nmuch better from seeing it than from the print. But I principally\r\nshould have wanted time to run over my accounts, to review the debts\r\nand credits of several loose memoranda, and find from the result\r\nthat I had not acted imprudently or unguardedly in omitting the\r\nnecessary preparations to such a journey. My dear child, my lovely\r\nBobbin, I left in perfect health, the rest of my family well and\r\nprovided for in every respect as they themselves had chalked out,\r\nthe ‘Annals’ lodged in the hands of a man on whose friendship and\r\nabilities I could entirely confide. Revolving these circumstances in\r\nmy mind gave me pleasure, so that I could hardly regret in the\r\nevening the day which in the morning I had pronounced lost. At night\r\nI went into a bye boat[117] and had a villainous passage of fourteen\r\nhours. Nine hours rolling at anchor had so fatigued my mare that I\r\nthought it necessary for her to rest one day, but next morning I\r\nleft Calais.\r\n\r\n‘_l._—Wait at Desseins three days for a wind, Dover, London,\r\nBradfield, and have more pleasure in giving my little girl a French\r\ndoll than in viewing Versailles.’[118]\r\n\r\nThe journey to France cost me 118_l._ 15_s._ 2_d._ Things bought,\r\n20_l._ 17_s._; books, 8_l._ 16_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nThis year I had a long visit at Bradfield from M. Bukaty, nephew to\r\nthe Polish Ambassador, a heavy, dull man with a Tartar countenance.\r\nHis intention was to learn agriculture, but he made a poor progress.\r\nMy correspondence this year contained much variety, and I have\r\nreperused many of the letters with much pleasure. In the number were\r\nthe following:—\r\n\r\nFrom Sir J. Sinclair[119] on clothing for sheep, which he sent and\r\ndesired me to buy. I did so, and the rest of the flock took them I\r\nsuppose for beasts of prey, and fled in all directions, till the\r\nclothed sheep jumping hedges and ditches soon derobed themselves.\r\n\r\n                                         ‘Whitehall: April 11, 1787.\r\n\r\n  ‘Sir,—I went yesterday to Knightsbridge, and have ordered the\r\n  canvas for covering the sheep, which will be ready next week, and\r\n  I shall be glad to know how it can be best forwarded.\r\n\r\n  ‘My idea is to put the coverings on immediately after the sheep\r\n  are shorn, when I imagine it would be comfortable instead of\r\n  distressing to the animal.

At Exeter I passed ten\r\n  days with my old friend the Bishop, Dr. Ross, and however I may\r\n  have lost my time in other things I certainly was not deficient in\r\n  my religious duties, for during the ten days I attended divine\r\n  service nineteen times, taking in his Lordship’s private chapel\r\n  and the cathedral.\r\n\r\n  ‘After visiting most of the fine seats in Somersetshire &c.\r\n  including Lord Radnor’s famous triangular house, I came to\r\n  Salisbury, where I met several old acquaintances, and among the\r\n  rest Mr. Windham, who published Doddington’s Diary, and who\r\n  permitted me to look over the vast collection of Doddington’s\r\n  private correspondence, and to copy what I pleased.\r\n\r\n  ‘From Salisbury I came hither, having made nearly a thousand miles\r\n  in my gig, without suffering the least inconvenience, either from\r\n  weather or accident.

I was most strenuous in the cause. By this\r\nBill the growers of wool were laid under most insufferable\r\nrestraints by its patrons the manufacturers, under the false\r\npretence which had upon so many occasions been listened to by the\r\nLegislature, that immense quantities of wool were smuggled to\r\nFrance; on the gross fallacy of which they made good use, in taking\r\nthose measures which answered their only design, that of sinking the\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nI applied to many of the leading members of both Houses of\r\nParliament, but to very little effect. Those who deputed me were\r\nvery desirous that I should see Mr. Fox on the subject; and Sir\r\nPeter Burrell, who was also greatly hostile to the Bill, and acted\r\nat that time as Lord Great Chamberlain of England at the trial of\r\nMr. Hastings, recommended me to take an opportunity of the managers\r\nfor the Commons, waiting at that trial to desire to speak with Mr.\r\nFox in the manager’s box; and with this view gave me a pass ticket\r\nfor the whole trial, by means of which I could be at the bar ready\r\nto serve such an opportunity when it offered. These tickets were\r\nsold at twenty guineas each; and this afforded me many opportunities\r\nof much entertainment. I accordingly saw Mr. Fox, and found him by\r\nno means inclined to patronise any opposition to the Bill. All that\r\ncould be done was to make him a master of certain important facts of\r\nwhich he was ignorant, and which did seem to have some little weight\r\nwith him. It may here be observed that as I was walking one day in\r\nFleet Street with my pass ticket and a 20_l._ note in my pocket\r\nbook, I was hustled unskilfully by a knot of rascals, who picked the\r\nbook out of my pocket, but I missing it instantly, luckily observed\r\nit on the pavement near my foot, and seized on it immediately, and\r\nthe rascals went off at once. By means of this ticket I was present\r\nwhen Mr. Sheridan made the speech that rendered his eloquence so\r\ncelebrated.[123] I was examined at the Bar of the Houses of Lords\r\nand Commons, and published two pamphlets on the subject of the Wool\r\nBill.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding all the opposition that was made to the measure,\r\nafter moderating some of the most hostile clauses the Bill passed;\r\nbut the manufacturers experienced so determined and vigorous an\r\nopposition that they would hardly engage again in any similar attack\r\nupon the landed interest. In the course of this business I\r\nexperienced a strange instance of roguery in an Ipswich attorney\r\nnamed Kirby. This man was appointed secretary and receiver of the\r\nSuffolk subscriptions for supporting the expense of opposing the\r\nBill. He paid the reckoning twice at the ‘Crown and Anchor’ when a\r\nfew persons dined there; and after that, under various pretences,\r\nwhen money was to be paid; and on a moderate computation put more\r\nthan 100_l._ into his own pocket. I was unwilling to believe it, but\r\nupon his death a few years after it was found that he was one of the\r\ngreatest knaves the devil ever created.\r\n\r\nMy deputation by the county of Suffolk to represent it, in opposing\r\nthe Bill at the bar of the two Houses of Parliament, in the same\r\nmanner as Sir Joseph Banks, a highly eminent character for influence\r\nand affluence, was deputed by the county of Lincoln, did me much\r\nhonour, and shows that a prophet may sometimes be esteemed, even in\r\nhis own country. The reader who is desirous of becoming acquainted\r\nwith this portion of the history of wool in England may consult my\r\nQuestion of Wool—my speech that might have been spoken—my Reasons\r\nagainst the Bill, and various other papers by myself, inserted in\r\nthe ‘Annals.’\r\n\r\nThe opposition certainly would have been successful if Mr. Pitt had\r\nnot found what so many ministers have experienced before—that the\r\ntrading interest at large is a hundred times more active than the\r\nlanded interest; for very few counties exerted themselves on this\r\noccasion. Had half of them acted like Suffolk the Bill would have\r\nbeen inevitably lost, and had I not been a resident in Suffolk that\r\ncounty would have slept with the rest. It may not be amiss to\r\nobserve that a pamphlet was published, entitled a ‘Letter to Arthur\r\nYoung, Esq., on the Wool Bill, by Thomas Day,[124] Esq.,’ from which\r\nthe following is an extract:—\r\n\r\n  ‘If we are delivered from the present danger, I know no one who\r\n  has so great a claim to the public gratitude as yourself. As soon\r\n  as the storm began to gather, your active eye remarked the curling\r\n  of the waters and the blackening of the horizon, while all our\r\n  other Palinuruses were quietly slumbering around. Distinguished,\r\n  therefore, as you long have been for literary talents, you have\r\n  now added a nobler wreath, and a sublimer praise to all you\r\n  merited before.’ Mr. Day in this letter calls my opposition to the\r\n  Bill ‘A noble stand in defence of the common liberties.’\r\n\r\n‘_April 22._—I was examined on the Wool Bill in the House of\r\nCommons. It was a most hard-fought battle between the manufacturers\r\nand the landed interest; the Bill laid heavy shackles on every\r\nmovement of wool near the sea coast, and was opposed with great\r\nresolution, both by Sir Joseph Banks and myself.\r\n\r\n‘We opposed it both in the Commons and the Lords, both being\r\nexamined at the Bar of the two Houses; the manufacturers on this\r\noccasion were so hotly opposed that Sir Joseph thought they would be\r\nquiet in future. I was of a different opinion, being convinced that\r\nthey never would omit any opportunity of imposing their shackle on\r\nthat insensible, torpid, and stupid body “the landlords of\r\nBritain.”’\r\n\r\nAbout this time Count Leopold Berchtold[125] visited me at\r\nBradfield. But part of the time which he spent in Suffolk (I being\r\nabsent) was at the ‘Angel’ at Bury, where he lived an extraordinary\r\nlife of retirement and economy. He daily went out, and employed the\r\nwhole day in writing and reading. Such temperance has scarcely been\r\nknown. He drank neither wine nor beer, and would dine upon a potato\r\nor an egg.\r\n\r\nHe told the landlord of that inn that he could not live in the\r\nmanner of other travellers, but that he might charge what he pleased\r\nfor his apartments. He was a most extraordinary personage. His\r\nfather had a considerable estate in Bohemia, and one reason for the\r\nson’s travelling over a great part of the world was the extreme\r\ndisgust he took at the measures of the Emperor Joseph II., which\r\nwere oppressive and ruinous to the nobility &c., constantly changing\r\nhis ill-formed political schemes. He had lived in the principal\r\ncountries of Europe long enough to become a master of their\r\nlanguages, in every one of which he printed a work which he\r\nconceived might be useful to the inhabitants. When at Bradfield he\r\nwas working hard to learn Arabic, as he proposed passing from\r\nEngland to Morocco, thence to Egypt and Arabia. This journey\r\nafterwards he executed, and returned home to Bohemia through the\r\ngreatest part of the Turkish Empire; and, after escaping a thousand\r\ndangers, as he was going to Vienna was murdered by banditti.\r\n\r\nHe was very tall and graceful in his person, of a handsome,\r\nexpressive countenance, and as elegant as if he had passed his whole\r\nlife in a Court. Though invested with the Order of St. Stephano by\r\nthe Grand Duke of Tuscany, Leopold, he never wore it in England, as\r\nhis father being alive made it necessary for him to live\r\neconomically. His conversation was intelligent and pleasing, his\r\nknowledge almost universal. He travelled much on foot; and once\r\nthrough France or Germany—I forget which—when he was beset by three\r\nor four robbers; but he assumed so much firmness in his manner, with\r\nso resolute and determined an air, and with so threatening an\r\nattitude of defence, that, after a pause, the robbers retired,\r\nthinking it best to let him alone. He had a sabre or some other\r\nweapon, and said that they might have had the worst of it if they\r\nhad made the attack, as he had before been set on in the same way\r\nmore than once.\r\n\r\nHis first business in every country was to study unremittingly till\r\nhe had perfectly learnt the language, as without this he considered\r\nmen and women but as cows and sheep. He then applied himself with\r\nsingular assiduity to understand those branches of human industry or\r\npolitical economy for which the country was most celebrated, and for\r\nthis purpose applied to those who were most able to satisfy his\r\ninquiries. He was introduced to me by Anthony Souga, the Imperial\r\nConsul at London, who gave him the highest possible character. When\r\nhe had registered these inquiries and printed a book in the\r\nlanguage, he left the country for some other.\r\n\r\nThe grand object of Ct. B.’s investigations and inquiries seemed to\r\nbe not so much the good of the countries he visited, as to possess\r\nhimself of a great mass of that sort of knowledge which might be\r\nmost useful in adding to the welfare and happiness of the\r\ninhabitants of that estate to which he was born, and which was a\r\nvery extensive property. He spent some time with me in Suffolk\r\ngleaning agricultural information, intending to apply it to the\r\nfarmers and peasants of his paternal estate and of his own favourite\r\nBohemia, from which he often lamented that he was driven by the\r\nfolly and tyranny of Joseph II. It was with great concern that I\r\nheard of his very unfortunate and untimely death about ten years\r\nafter leaving England. He was about thirty-six years of age when in\r\nSuffolk, was possessed of various and uncommon powers, built\r\nmentally and bodily on a great scale, talked English like a native,\r\nwalked like a giant, and was of all the multitude of foreigners who\r\nfrequented my house the most persevering and the most intelligent.\r\n\r\nThis year I made some experiments on the distemper in wheat called\r\nthe smut, which were amongst the most satisfactory and decisive that\r\nI ever found, and in which I corrected some errors of Mr. de\r\nTillet,[126] and proved, too clearly to be doubted, the proximate\r\ncause and prevention of that disease.\r\n\r\nIt is almost intolerable, after experiments so decisive, that so\r\nmany men, through ignorance of what I had done, should for a long\r\ntime have been bewildering themselves upon the same subject, and\r\ncontinuing to do so to the present day, publishing, too, the\r\ngreatest errors. These experiments are inserted in the ‘Annals.’\r\n\r\nThis year I set out on my second journey to France in the month of\r\nJuly. I made this alone, my cloak-bag behind me; and I did not\r\ntravel thus an[127] hundred miles before my mare fell blind. I have\r\nheard and read much of the pleasure of travelling; how it may be\r\nwith posting—_avant-couriers_ preparing apartments and repasts—I\r\nknow not. Let those who enjoy such comfort pity me, who made 3,700\r\nmiles on a blind mare! and brought her (humanity would not allow me\r\nto sell her) safe back to Bradfield. I claim but one merit—that of\r\npractising in the midst of all this folly the severest economy in\r\ntravelling.\r\n\r\nIn the winter Mr. Macro took a seat in my postchaise on a farming\r\ntour across Essex and into Sussex, where we spent a day or two with\r\nLord Sheffield.\r\n\r\nIn this tour I learned that General Murray had 4,000 South Down\r\nsheep, and that he fed them with potatoes. This was sufficient. To\r\ncome into the country on the search for sheep and potato\r\nintelligence, and not to see such a man, would not be to make a very\r\nwise figure when we returned home. But I had not the honour to be\r\nknown to the General. No matter; 4,000 sheep fed on potatoes were an\r\nobject before which form must give way. I wrote a card, stating our\r\npursuit, and wishes to have it gratified, desiring leave to view his\r\nflock. Those who know the General’s liberality and passion for\r\nagriculture will not want to be told what the answer was. We spent\r\nfive days in his house, and found it the residence of hospitality\r\nand good sense.\r\n\r\nMrs. Murray had resided nine years in the island of Majorca, being\r\nthe daughter of the English consul. She gave me many particulars\r\nrelating to that island, and, among others, that the climate was by\r\nfar the finest she had ever experienced. She never was for a single\r\nhour either too hot or too cold, nor ever saw a fog; but the people\r\nwere unpleasant, ignorant and bigoted.\r\n\r\nI was always very regular in keeping accounts, but do not often\r\nmention them in this detail; I may, however, just observe that I\r\nseemed to have been no bad economist, as the total expense of house,\r\ngarden, stable, servants, and keeping a postchaise with not a little\r\ncompany, cost in four months 97_l._ 2_s._ 3_d._, or at the rate of\r\n291_l._ 6_s._ 9_d._ per annum; how it was done I forget. If such an\r\nexpense be compared with the present times[128] it will show the\r\nenormous difference, arising principally from the desperate increase\r\nof taxation, which has crippled so many classes of the kingdom; but\r\nI had a large farm in my hands. On being at London, some time after,\r\nI went to Esher and spent a day with Mr. Ducket, examining his farm\r\nwith great attention; he dined with me at the ‘Tun,’ and I had a\r\nvery interesting conversation with him to a late hour, upon all the\r\npoints of his husbandry.\r\n\r\nIn this year I first introduced the cultivation of Cichorium\r\nIntybus[129] at Bradfield, and registered it in the ‘Annals of\r\nAgriculture;’ it was at first upon a small scale, but sufficient to\r\nconvince me of the vast importance of the plant. I brought the seed\r\nfrom Lyons in France, and gradually extended the culture till I had\r\nabove one hundred acres of it; the utter stupidity of the farming\r\nworld was never more apparent than in their neglect of this plant,\r\nso repeatedly recommended in the ‘Annals.’ The Duke of Bedford kept\r\nten large sheep per acre on a field of it.\r\n\r\nThe following letters were among others received this year:—\r\n\r\nFrom B. H. Latrobe, Esq., on my being burnt in effigy at Norwich by\r\nthe manufacturers (_in re_ Wool Bill), a very lively letter.\r\n\r\n                        ‘Stamp Office, Somerset Place: May 22, 1788.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—We have been waiting for your arrival in town\r\n  _patiently_ for the week past, and I am afraid we must now make up\r\n  our minds to wait _patiently_ a great deal longer, as the passing\r\n  of the Wool Bill has not been able to bring you to town. By the\r\n  word _We_ I mean my brother, our friend the lord of slaves,[130]\r\n  myself, and I dare say it includes fifty other people whom I have\r\n  not the honour of knowing. We have been three days past laying our\r\n  heads together to find out some method of _doing you honour in\r\n  effigy_ in order to make up to you in some measure the disgrace\r\n  you have undergone (as is creditably reported about town) of being\r\n  burnt in effigy by the wool manufacturers at Bury. My brother is\r\n  for procuring your effigy, and after having crowned it with a\r\n  wreath composed of turnip roots, cabbage leaves, potato-apples,\r\n  wheat-ears, oats, straws, &c., and tied with a band of wool,\r\n  thinks it ought to be placed upon its pedestal (being the volume\r\n  of Virgil’s “Georgics”) to be worshipped by the real patriots; Mr.\r\n  Huthhausen thinks a plain ribbon a sufficient honour for a man\r\n  whose ideas can admit of the belief of slavery in Silesia; and, as\r\n  for myself, I am of opinion that a man whose life has been devoted\r\n  without fee or reward to the service of the public has so great a\r\n  reward arising from the consciousness of having done good, and so\r\n  just a claim to honour, that I shall not trouble my head about\r\n  methods to _increase it_. But I must beg your pardon for this\r\n  lady-like chat, though your having been burnt in effigy is enough\r\n  to make any pen run wild.... I could wish that a favour I have to\r\n  beg of you were not inconvenient.’\r\n\r\n[The writer requests that some remarks of his own on the book named\r\nabove may be inserted in the ‘Annals.’]\r\n\r\nFrom Edmund Burke, Esq., on an application I made to him relative to\r\nthe Wool Bill. [_Unfortunately no copy can be found of this\r\nletter._]\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Banks gives me joy of being burned in effigy at Norwich\r\n(Bury?) on account of my opposition to the Wool Bill:—\r\n\r\n                                         ‘Soho Square: May 13, 1788.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—With this you will receive the “Instructions given to\r\n  the Council against the Wool Bill.”[131]\r\n\r\n  ‘I have corrected the whole, but I fear you will find it miserably\r\n  deficient in point of composition, but as I am not ambitious on\r\n  that head I mean to be satisfied if I am intelligible.\r\n\r\n  ‘I give you joy sincerely at having arrived at the glory of being\r\n  burned in effigy; nothing is so conclusive a proof of your\r\n  possessing the best of the argument. No one was ever burned if he\r\n  was wrong—the business in that case is to expose his blunders—but\r\n  when argument is precluded firebrands are ready substitutes.\r\n\r\n                                ‘Believe me, dear Sir,\r\n                                              ‘Yours faithfully,\r\n                                                         ‘J. BANKS.’\r\n\r\n1789.—I had yet work to do in France; the survey of that kingdom was\r\nnot completed in the journeys of the two preceding years. I did not\r\nhesitate therefore, but as soon as business at home would permit me\r\nto be absent I set out on my third expedition, June 2, and went to\r\nParis in the diligence. As the carrying specimens of remarkable\r\nsoils and of manufactures, wool, &c. was so inconvenient, I made\r\nthis journey in a chaise. Through the kindness of the Duchess\r\nd’Estissac (de Rochefoucauld) I was most agreeably received at the\r\nHôtel de la Rochefoucauld, and as the States General were assembling\r\nI went thither to the Duke’s apartment, where I met many persons of\r\nnote, such as the Duke of Orleans, the Abbé Sieyès, Rabaut St.\r\nÉtienne,[132] &c. and was present at an interesting debate in the\r\nNational Assembly. I spent some time at Paris, which I quitted on my\r\nthird journey on June 28. I felt much regret on taking leave of my\r\nexcellent friend Monsieur Lazowski, whose anxiety for the fate of\r\nhis country[133] made me respect his character as much as I had\r\nreason to love it for the thousand attentions I was in the daily\r\nhabit of receiving from him. My kind protectress the Duchess\r\nd’Estissac had the goodness to make me promise that I would again\r\nreturn to her hospitable hotel when I had finished the journey.\r\n\r\nAt Toulon I sold my horse and chaise, as I had been informed that I\r\ncould not thus travel with safety in Italy. I embarked at Toulon to\r\nsave one or two stages, which gave me an opportunity of viewing the\r\nfine harbours of that port. On leaving Nice I went by a _vetturino_\r\nto Turin, and was fortunate in making the acquaintance of some of\r\nthe gentlemen that accompanied me. At that capital I was introduced\r\nto various lovers of the plough, and received much valuable\r\ninformation. From this place I went to Milan, where through the kind\r\nattentions of the Abate[134] Amorette, a true lover of agriculture\r\nand a friend of its professors, I was introduced to a variety of\r\npersons who afforded me much intelligence and accompanied me to the\r\nseat of the Count di Castiglioni, sixteen miles north of the city,\r\nwith whom I passed sufficient time to give me an opportunity of\r\nremarking the country life of an Italian nobleman of high\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nFrom Milan I went to Lodi through one of the finest scenes of\r\nirrigation in the world. At the latter place I assisted in the whole\r\noperation of making a Lodesan, called Parmesan cheese in England,\r\nand thereby learnt a few circumstances in that manufacture, which I\r\nafterwards applied with success in making cheese in Suffolk. At Lodi\r\nI attended the opera, where the Archduke and Archduchess with the\r\nmost splendid company were present, and it gave me particular\r\npleasure to find such a house so filled in a little town quite\r\ndependent on cows, butter and cheese.\r\n\r\nAt Bergamo I was electrified by the fine eyes of an Italian fair,\r\nand just as I was making a nearer approach, impeded in it by the\r\nsudden appearance of her husband.\r\n\r\nAt Verona I viewed its celebrated amphitheatre and gained some\r\nagricultural intelligence, then on to Vicenza and Padua, where I\r\nstayed some days, having introductions to several professors, then\r\nby the canal to Venice, where I employed several days in viewing\r\nthat singular place and numberless curiosities to be found in it. It\r\nfully answered my expectations.\r\n\r\nAt Bologna I was so fortunate as to meet Mr. Taylor, of Bifrons, in\r\nKent, with his very agreeable family. By him I was introduced to\r\nsuch of the nobility of the place as had a taste for farming, which,\r\nwith some excursions in the vicinity, enabled me to understand the\r\nagriculture of the district.\r\n\r\nThence I travelled to Florence, where my time was divided between\r\nagriculture and the Tribuna, that is, between Farmers and Venuses.\r\n\r\nI was here introduced to many celebrated characters and to others\r\nable to give me valuable agricultural information. At home we had a\r\nvery pleasant party, and abroad our eyes were feasted with all that\r\nArt or Science could produce.\r\n\r\nQuitting Turin [on the return journey] I joined company with Mr.\r\nGrundy, a considerable merchant, from Birmingham. We crossed over\r\nMont Cenis on our route to Lyons.[135]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of this year I met Dr. Watson several times at my\r\nfriend Symonds’, and shall here copy a private note I made on that\r\ncelebrated character.\r\n\r\nI was well acquainted with him for some years before he was made a\r\nBishop as well as long after. Nor is it strange that I should be\r\nassiduous in cultivating a connection with a man of such\r\nextraordinary powers, who had a most peculiar felicity in bringing\r\nall the stores of a richly furnished mind to bear as occasion\r\nrequired in conversation. His memory was wonderfully retentive, and\r\nhe had the art of speaking upon subjects with which he was not well\r\nacquainted without betraying any ignorance. He had a clear, logical\r\nhead, great promptness of application, and the utmost fluency of\r\nexpression, but sometimes with an affectation of enunciation in a\r\ndelicate manner which did not at all become the native sturdiness of\r\nhis disposition. He had a mathematical calculating head, which\r\nenabled him readily to apply scientific researches to the ordinary\r\npurposes of life. His style was always uncommonly perspicuous. The\r\nKing once said to him, ‘I know not how it is, my Lord, but when I\r\nread any of your publications I am never for one moment at a loss\r\nfor your meaning, whereas in reading the works of other very able\r\nmen their want of clearness often makes me doubtful.’ ‘Sir,’ replied\r\nthe Bishop, ‘we are very assiduous at Cambridge to study Euclid and\r\nLocke.’ Almost from being made a Bishop he became a disgusted man,\r\nbecause he never could procure a translation, and it was supposed\r\nthat the Queen was influenced against him by Bishop Porteus, who had\r\nnot so high an opinion of him as many others. He was once speaking\r\nto Porteus in praise of Locke’s ‘Reasonableness of Christianity,’\r\nand said in the course of conversation, ‘I presume, my Lord, you are\r\nof the same opinion.’ But Porteus, who had not been able to get in a\r\nword for some time, with a firmness not perhaps common with him when\r\nconversing with such a man as Watson, said, ‘Indeed, my Lord, I am\r\nquite of a different opinion’—then left the room abruptly.\r\n\r\nWatson disapproved of his daughter learning Latin, but was very\r\nassiduous to procure her translations of the Classics. Upon coming\r\nto the University, or not long after, he found himself very\r\ndeficient in Classical learning, and applied to recover lost time\r\nwith indefatigable attention. He was tutor to Mr. Luther, of Essex,\r\nat Cambridge, and was useful to him in the great contested election\r\nfor that county. Soon after, Luther, as was supposed from motives of\r\neconomy, went to France, and, in his absence, some malignant reports\r\nwere spread to his disadvantage. Watson saw the great importance of\r\ntrampling upon them immediately; not trusting to any correspondence,\r\nhe went to Paris, and represented to him the necessity of instantly\r\nreturning and showing himself in every company that was possible.\r\nLuther felt the propriety of the advice, and directly returned with\r\nthe Doctor, whose conduct upon this and many other occasions made\r\nsuch an impression on his mind that he left him a good estate in the\r\nvery heart of the Earl of Egremont’s at Petworth, so that part of it\r\njoined not only the park, but the garden. To purchase this estate\r\nwas a very great object to Lord E., and the Bishop, not liking to\r\nask too high a price in the years’ purchase for the land, made a\r\nvaluation of a great quantity of young timber on what would be the\r\nfuture value of the trees, and by this means contrived to have a\r\nvery great price for the estate. It was too great an object to Lord\r\nE. to be refused; but the Bishop did not escape without censure.\r\n\r\nCount Leopold Berchtold published this year his ‘Hints to Patriotic\r\nTravellers,’ which in a very handsome manner he dedicated to me. My\r\ncorrespondence was somewhat numerous. I could give a long list, but\r\nshall only mention the following:—\r\n\r\nFrom Count Bukaty, Polish Ambassador, invitation from the King of\r\nPoland.[136]\r\n\r\n                                       ‘Holles Street: May 27, 1789.\r\n\r\n  ‘Sir,—I acquit myself of my old debt of gratitude which I owe you\r\n  in returning my sincere thanks for all the kindness which my\r\n  nephew has experienced from you and your family during his\r\n  residence at Bradfield Hall. I left him in Poland to spread your\r\n  name and superior merit, which is already so well known and justly\r\n  admired all over Europe. Your well-deserved fame reaching his\r\n  Majesty the King of Poland, and his brother, the Prince Primate,\r\n  makes them wish to see you once in that country, whose natural\r\n  riches consisting in agriculture might be essentially improved by\r\n  your transcendent knowledge therein. It was already their\r\n  intention to establish there a Society of Agriculture, had it not\r\n  been for the present political circumstances, which necessarily\r\n  take up all their time and attention. I would be exceedingly\r\n  happy, Sir, when you will be present in Town in order to have some\r\n  conversation with you on the subject. In the meantime, I take the\r\n  liberty to ask your favour in informing me where I could get the\r\n  machine for separating corn from chaff, whereof the drawing was\r\n  brought to Poland by my nephew?\r\n\r\n  ‘I have the honour to be, with the greatest respect,\r\n\r\n            ‘Sir, your most obedient, &c.,\r\n                            ‘F. BUKATY,\r\n                                    ‘Envoy Extraordinary of Poland.’\r\n\r\n                         _From Dr. Burney_\r\n\r\n                                    ‘Chelsea College: Oct. 20, 1789.\r\n\r\n  ‘My dear Friend,—I have begged a corner of this sheet from your\r\n  daughter Bessy to congratulate you on your safe arrival on\r\n  Classic ground after the perils and dangers of Gothic ground.\r\n  How insipid will the history of the present times in this last\r\n  country render all other history! And what weight will it not\r\n  give to what has been long called the history of Fabulous times!\r\n  The Poissardes are but the Amazons of the present day, and the\r\n  leaders at the attack of the Bastille the Hercules and Theseus.\r\n  The fetching the King, Queen, and Royal Family from Versailles,\r\n  and the total demolition of the ancient government of the\r\n  Kingdom, have no type in history or fable, ancient or modern.\r\n  The nobles and clergy indiscriminately stripped of their honours\r\n  and property, not to give it to others of the same rank and\r\n  class, but to the mob, who are helping themselves to whatever\r\n  they like, and destroying whom and what is not honoured with\r\n  their approbation in a more successful and effectual way than\r\n  our Wat Tyler or Jack Straw ever intended, and which would have\r\n  astonished even J. J. Rousseau had he been living, in spite of\r\n  his ideas of an _égalité de condition_. But whether a totally\r\n  levelling scheme can be rendered permanent in a great Empire or\r\n  no, time, not experience, can show. I used to think _la loi des\r\n  plus forts_ only existed among savages, and that in Society\r\n  there were tall minds as well as tall bodies, but none such have\r\n  as yet appeared in France. But let us talk of Italy, where I\r\n  found no want of tall minds, even in these degenerate days. I am\r\n  glad you seem to like the farming of the Milanese. I was\r\n  particularly struck with it all through Lombardy, and think you\r\n  will find even among the peasantry shrewdness, industry, and\r\n  ingenuity. In all the great cities I found philosophers,\r\n  mathematicians, and scholars, as well as musicians; these last,\r\n  indeed, make more _noise_ in the world, and, being travellers,\r\n  spread their own fame into remote countries, while the drone and\r\n  scientific part of a nation are seldom heard of out of the walls\r\n  of their colleges or towns till after their decease. Indeed,\r\n  almost all those I knew personally nineteen years ago in Italy\r\n  are now no more! Padre Boccaria at Turin, Padre Boscovich at\r\n  Milan, and Padre Sacchi. This last, I believe, is still living.\r\n  But Count Firmian is dead, to whom I and every English traveller\r\n  was much obliged by his hospitality and kindness. You probably\r\n  owe the same obligation to his successor, with whose name even I\r\n  am unacquainted. If you go to Padua you will probably stop at\r\n  Verona, where there are always men of learning and science. But\r\n  you must not judge of the present state of musick in any part of\r\n  Italy unless you remain there during the Carnival. At other\r\n  times (except at the great fairs) the principal theatres are\r\n  shut, and the others supplied with such riff-raff as our\r\n  Sadler’s Wells during summer. If Guadagni had been living, you\r\n  would have him at Padua, and if I had not engaged him to the\r\n  Pantheon, Pachierotti, whom we expect here in a few days. Pray\r\n  go to the church of Sant’ Antonio on a festival; there Tartini\r\n  used to lead and Guadagni sing. If Padre Valetti is living, the\r\n  Maestro di Capella, pray present my compliments to him and\r\n  enquire after the sequel of his Treatise. I have as yet only\r\n  seen the first part. I likewise beg to be remembered to Signor\r\n  Marsili, the Professor of Botany, and Padre Columbo, the\r\n  Professor of Mathematics: the first was some time in England and\r\n  speaks our language; the second was the great friend of Tartini,\r\n  and left in possession of all his manuscript papers. Enquire\r\n  what is become of them, and try to get intelligence of the\r\n  disposal of Padre Martini’s papers, books, and sequel of his\r\n  ‘History of Musick’ at Bologna. Enquire likewise when you meet\r\n  with intelligent musical people what are the defects of the\r\n  newest and best of the great Italian theatres. No plan is, I\r\n  believe, as yet adopted for rebuilding ours. Le Texier has a\r\n  model made with many conveniences and more magnificence than our\r\n  former theatre could boast, but whether it will be adopted, or\r\n  whether it is to be wished that a Frenchman should ever have the\r\n  management of an Italian opera, I know not. However partial he\r\n  or his countrymen may seem to German and Italian musick, I know\r\n  by long observation that they are totally ignorant of, and\r\n  enemies to, _good singing_, without which what are the two or\r\n  three acts of an opera but intermezzi or act tunes to the\r\n  ballets? I perceive, however, that, amidst all the horrors of\r\n  Paris, they suffer Italian operas to be performed in Italian and\r\n  by Italians, which were never allowed before, except at\r\n  Versailles; but these are only burlettas; serious operas so\r\n  performed might have some effect on the national taste in\r\n  singing. But les Dames des Halles, their excellencies _Mesdames\r\n  les Poissardes_, furnish them with “other fish to fry” at\r\n  present; so I shall say no more of France, but that I pity most\r\n  sincerely every honest man who has the misfortune to be resident\r\n  in that distracted kingdom.\r\n\r\n  ‘God bless you, my dear Sir, and give you health and spirits to\r\n  enjoy your rational and useful enquiries.\r\n\r\n                                                   ‘CHARLES BURNEY.’\r\n\r\n[The following extracts from Arthur Young’s letters home, and letter\r\nto his darling Bobbin, then aged five, are worth giving. With very\r\nslight excisions all letters to his daughter Mary are incorporated\r\nin the ‘French Travels.’]\r\n\r\n  ‘_Lyons, Dec. 28, 1789._—Symonds says Arthur has set off very well\r\n  at Cambridge, which I am very glad to hear. God send him\r\n  understanding enough to know the value of these four years there,\r\n  which are either lost absolutely or applied to the amelioration of\r\n  all his life after. French and Italian or German after four years\r\n  at Cambridge may qualify it for anything.’\r\n\r\nFrom another letter to the same:—\r\n\r\n  ‘I found here your Mother’s two letters, of which I can hardly\r\n  make head or tail; according to custom they are so cross written\r\n  and so crammed and topsy-turvy, that, like the oracles of old,\r\n  they may be made to speak whatever is in the reader’s head, alley\r\n  croaker (sic) or “Paradise Lost” are all one.’\r\n\r\nFrom a third letter, dated Florence, November 18, 1789:—\r\n\r\n  ‘I received here a letter from you, and two from your Mother;\r\n  yours is dated October 17, one of hers the 30th, the other no\r\n  date, and not a word of Bobbin in it. What a way of writing, and\r\n  this to a man 1,400 miles from home. I am greatly concerned for\r\n  Mr. Arbuthnot, though his silence made him dead to us from the\r\n  time he went to Ireland. I never knew a family which was the\r\n  centre of every mild and agreeable virtue so shattered into\r\n  nothing by a man’s failure. I have long and often regretted that\r\n  period.... I took 100l. with me, and it lasts exactly six months,\r\n  buying books included.... Good night. Thank God, Bobbin is well;\r\n  give her a kiss.’\r\n\r\n            _To his youngest Daughter, Martha (Bobbin)_\r\n\r\n                                           ‘Moulins: August 7, 1789.\r\n\r\n  ‘My dear Bobbin,—I fully expected to have heard from Mary here,\r\n  and to have known how my dear little girl does, but I was much\r\n  disappointed and found no letter from England.\r\n\r\n  ‘I think it high time to enquire of you how you pass your\r\n  time—what you do—how Mr. Mag (the pony) does, and the four\r\n  kittens; I hope you have taken care of them and remembered your\r\n  Papa wants cats. Do the flowers grow well in your garden? Are you\r\n  a better gardener than you used to be? The Marq. de Guerchy’s\r\n  little girls have a little house on a little hill, and on one side\r\n  a little flower garden, and on the other side a little kitchen\r\n  garden, which they manage themselves and keep very clean from\r\n  weeds—Bobbin would like much to see it.\r\n\r\n  ‘I have passed through perils and dangers, for a part of the\r\n  country is infested by 800 plunderers in arms, yet have burnt in\r\n  only one district near Mâcon twelve chateaus; but I am now passed\r\n  the worst and hope to escape at last with whole bones. I have a\r\n  passport, and am carried to the Bourgeois guard at all the towns.\r\n\r\n  ‘Pray, my little girl, take care, and keep clear from weeds the\r\n  row of grass I sowed in the round garden, on right hand about ten\r\n  yards long, but don’t take up anything like grass. And if the two\r\n  willows which I brought last year 1,000 miles from France are\r\n  alive yet, give them some water; one is by the hole, and the other\r\n  by Arthur’s garden—I made little mounds around them. You do not\r\n  know, my little Bobbin, how much I long to have a walk with you at\r\n  Bradfield. It is a sad thing I have no letter here; I shall have\r\n  none till Clermont. I desire a particular account of my farm to be\r\n  sent here.\r\n\r\n  ‘I have been ill from heat and fatigue, and had a sore throat, but\r\n  by care and an antiseptic diet I am now, thank God, quite well.\r\n\r\n  ‘What do you think of the French at such a moment as this with a\r\n  free press? yet in this capital of a great province there is not\r\n  (publickly) one newspaper to be seen; at a coffee house, where\r\n  twenty tables for company, not one.

I succeeded pretty well.’[137]\r\n\r\n1790.—All this summer I was employed in preparing my [French]\r\nTravels for the press. In October I had a violent fever, which\r\nbrought me to the brink of the grave. I made a minute of that\r\nillness in the following words: ‘From almost the bed of death, it\r\npleased the Divine Goodness to raise me up, and I remember it was in\r\nperfect hardness of heart and free from all true or grateful\r\nfeelings. I was in a state of blindness and insensibility, on which\r\nI reflect with horror and amazement.’[138]\r\n\r\nI cannot speak of the ingratitude of my heart to God at this period\r\nbut in the strongest terms, as it amounted to a degree of\r\ninsensibility quite unaccountable. I fear that not one thought of\r\nGod ever occurred to me at that time, and I doubt whether [it was\r\nso], while one evening I had resumed the habit of prayer, that is,\r\nof those formal prayers which an unconverted person may repeat\r\nwithout any real devotion; and yet during my delirium the physician\r\nafterwards told me that I one day broke forth into one of the most\r\neloquent and sublime prayers he ever heard, to his utter\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Transcription]]\r\n\r\nDuring my recovery I wrote that melancholy review of my past life,\r\nwhich is printed in the ‘Annals.’\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 121:\r\n\r\n  A Bill prohibiting the exportation of wool passed the House of\r\n  Commons, May 15, 1788.\r\n\r\nFootnote 122:\r\n\r\n  President of the Royal Society, and supporter of the cause of\r\n  agriculture and science; died 1810.\r\n\r\nFootnote 123:\r\n\r\n  ‘Then came the Oude case, that lasted no less than twenty-one\r\n  days, and ended by a speech from Sheridan on which great labour\r\n  and pains had been bestowed.

The following notes are from a journal\r\nI kept at that time:—\r\n\r\nThis year my daughter Elizabeth married the Rev. Samuel Hoole, son\r\nof the celebrated John Hoole, translator of Tasso and Ariosto. He is\r\na very sensible, moral man of strict integrity, and always behaved\r\nto my daughter with much tenderness.\r\n\r\nThis same year my correspondence[139] opened with General\r\nWashington. Having been applied to to procure some implements for\r\nhis husbandry, I wrote to him offering to procure any article in\r\nthat line which he might have occasion for, and accordingly\r\nafterwards sent him many, amongst others the plan of a barn, which\r\nhe executed, and is represented by a plate in the ‘Annals of\r\nAgriculture.’\r\n\r\nThis year his Majesty had the goodness to make me a present of a\r\nSpanish Merino ram, a portrait of which I inserted in the ‘Annals.’\r\n\r\nHow many millions of men are there that would smile if I were to\r\nmention the Sovereign of a great Empire giving a ram to a farmer as\r\nan event that merited the attention of mankind! The world is full of\r\nthose who consider military glory as the proper object of the\r\nambition of monarchs; who measure regal merit by the millions that\r\nare slaughtered; by the public robbery and plunder that are\r\ndignified by the titles of dignity and conquest, and who look down\r\non every exertion of peace and tranquillity as unbecoming those who\r\naim at the epithet _great_, and unworthy the aim of men that are\r\nborn the masters of the globe.\r\n\r\nMy ideas are cast in a very different mould, and I believe the\r\nperiod is advancing with accelerated pace that shall exhibit\r\ncharacters in a light totally new, and shall rather brand than exalt\r\nthe virtues hitherto admired; that shall place in full blaze of\r\nmeridian lustre actions lost on the mass of mankind; that shall pay\r\nmore homage to the memory of a Prince that gave a ram to a farmer\r\nthan for wielding the sceptre obeyed alike on the Ganges and on the\r\nThames.\r\n\r\nI shall presume to offer but one other general observation. When we\r\nsee his Majesty practising husbandry with that warmth that marks a\r\nfavourite pursuit, and taking such steps to diffuse a foreign breed\r\nof sheep well calculated to improve those of his kingdoms; when we\r\nsee the Royal pursuits take such a direction, we may safely conclude\r\nthat the public measures which, in certain instances, have been so\r\nhostile to the agriculture of this country, have nothing in common\r\nwith the opinions of our gracious Sovereign; such measures are the\r\nwork of men, who never felt for husbandry; who never practised it;\r\nwho never loved it; it is not such men that give rams to farmers.\r\n\r\n_October 21._—A letter to-day from General Washington—Gracious! from\r\nthe representative of the Majesty of America, all written with his\r\nown hand. Also one from the Marquis de la Fayette desiring my\r\nassistance to get him a bailiff that understands English ornamental\r\ngardening; for both he gives fifty louis[140] a year—this is a\r\nFrench idea to unite what never was united, and, when gained, reward\r\nit with wages little better than a common labourer.\r\n\r\n_October 24._—Dined yesterday at Sir Thomas Gage’s to meet the Miss\r\nFergus’s and Dr. and Mrs. Onslow. This Dr. was the youngest son of\r\nthe late General Onslow, brother of my godfather, the Speaker, in\r\nwhose family my dear mother was for many years upon the most\r\nintimate footing of private friendship.\r\n\r\nWhen a boy I was frequently at his house, and well remember having\r\nthis Arthur, a child, on my knee. Mrs. Onslow mentioned how much she\r\nhad heard Mr. Boswell talk of my works. I fancy Boswell, from some\r\nthings I heard of him, and it seems confirmed by various passages in\r\nhis ‘Life of Johnson,’ has a sort of rage for knowing all sorts of\r\npublic men, good, bad, and indifferent, all one if a man renders\r\nhimself known he likes to be acquainted with him. Mrs. Onslow\r\nreported to me the following conversation which took place at the\r\nPrince’s table:—\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales, with a large company dining with him, said,\r\n‘The three greatest coxcombs in England are in this room. Here is my\r\nfriend Hanger,[141] the Duke of Queensberry must come in for the\r\nsecond;’ he made a pause, enough for the company to stare for the\r\nthird, and added, ‘for the third, it is certainly myself.’\r\n\r\nWhen Sir W. Courtenay asked Lord Bute for a peerage, he carried his\r\npedigree with him. Lord Bute examined and pretended to be a good\r\njudge of those things. He told Mr. Symonds that nothing could be\r\nclearer or more unquestionable than his descent lineally from Louis\r\nle Gros of France, the relationship with the House of Bourbon which\r\noccasions the mourning of a day in the Court of France for the death\r\nof a Courtenay.[142] Lord Bute told him his demand of a barony was\r\ntoo modest, and that he should be a Viscount, which he was\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n_October 26._—In preparing my Travels [in France] for the press, I\r\nexperience strongly the importance of an author’s having composed so\r\nmuch more than he means to print as to be able to strike out\r\nlargely.\r\n\r\nMy agreement with Richardson was to have six shillings a volume for\r\nall sold of one guinea quarto volumes, but when Rackham’s compositor\r\ncame to cast off the MS. he found enough for two large quarto\r\nvolumes, since which discovery I had to strike out just half of what\r\nI had written; and the advantage will be very great to the work. I\r\nread the books as they are wanted for the press again and again,\r\nreducing the quantity every time till I get it tolerably to my mind,\r\nbut yet not to the amount of half. The work is certainly improved by\r\nthis means, and I am strongly of opinion if nine-tenths of other\r\nwriters were to do the same thing their performances would be so\r\nmuch the better; for one reads very few quartos that would not be\r\nimproved by reducing to octavo volumes.\r\n\r\n_November 23._—I was five days last week at the Duke of Grafton’s,\r\nAdmiral, Mrs., and two Miss Pigots were there—she [Mrs. P.] is\r\nsister to the Duchess, the Admiral is a very worthy man—Mr.\r\nStonehewer there also, and old Vary. I spent two days in taking the\r\nlevel of the Duke’s river for four miles, in order to see how much\r\nland he might water, and the improvement his estate is capable of is\r\nvery great indeed. The character of this Duke is original; he is\r\nuncommonly sensible, there is no stuff in him; he is cold, silent,\r\nreserved, and even at times sullen, and he is removed from all that\r\nease and suavity which render people agreeable; yet there is such a\r\nsolid understanding, and so much learning and knowledge on certain\r\ntopics, that one must value him in spite of our feelings.\r\n\r\nVery little of the conversation interesting enough to be worth\r\nrecording. I was also at a new club which Ruggles[143] has\r\ninstituted at Melford, which might have been an agreeable thing had\r\nthere been half a dozen only.\r\n\r\nThe following are [among] the letters preserved this year:—\r\n\r\nFrom Dr. Burney, congratulations, pleasant anecdotes, and an account\r\nof a large auction of books, &c.:—\r\n\r\n                                     ‘Chelsea College: Jan. 7, 1791.\r\n\r\n  ‘My dear Arthur,—The precipice on which you have so long been\r\n  scrambling for life seems to be more dangerous than any one of\r\n  those which I had to encounter from Sarzana to Genoa or Genoa to\r\n  Final. In the first of these scrambles during three days and three\r\n  nights on a mule without bridle (except that of Jack Ketch) or\r\n  saddle, I had a torrent called the Magra roaring in my ears at a\r\n  perpendicular distance of eight hundred or a thousand feet, and,\r\n  in the second, the Mediterranean, during a storm which no vessel\r\n  could weather. In the darkest night I ever _saw_, with the\r\n  artificial lights of our lanterns extinguished by the violence of\r\n  the wind, at every twenty or thirty yards the _pedino_ (a man on\r\n  foot to guide the mule) cried out, “Alla montagna! alla montagna,\r\n  Signore!” which was an admonition to alight and crawl on all fours\r\n  over broken roads on the ridge of a precipice.\r\n\r\n  ‘Now let _me_ play the _pedino’s_ part to your worship, and\r\n  admonish you to be very careful how you travel in the perilous way\r\n  to health which you have still to pass, after your escape from the\r\n  great precipice; for which escape, as an Italian would say, “_io\r\n  me ne congratulo non meno con me medesimo che con voi_.”\r\n\r\n  ‘But besides congratulating you on your amendment, I have for some\r\n  time wished to tell you that in the Paitoni catalogue of Italian\r\n  books now selling by auction at Robson’s room, there are many on\r\n  Natural History and Agriculture. Now as you have dipped into\r\n  Italian literature and farming, it struck me on seeing the\r\n  catalogue that there may be several works that you would wish to\r\n  purchase, particularly as the Italian books of Science have\r\n  hitherto sold at this auction for almost nothing. I purchased\r\n  nearly fifty volumes of poetry and miscellanies, and my bill did\r\n  not amount to five pounds. The books are in exceeding good\r\n  condition, and most of them such as have never appeared before in\r\n  the Osburn, Payne, or Robson catalogues. I am inclined to think\r\n  that this sale will enrich future catalogues in our country for\r\n  many years to come. Indeed I was so tired of eternally meeting\r\n  with the same book over and over again that I had no longer\r\n  patience to read them.\r\n\r\n  ‘If you see any you wish I will get them purchased, but as neither\r\n  your Bibliomania nor mine has ever raged to such a degree as to\r\n  wish to buy in at any price, it will be necessary to say that we\r\n  mean not to vie with those who being more curious in _books_ than\r\n  _authors_ procure them at any price to look at and not to read. A\r\n  rich acquaintance of mine, and a customer of old Tom Payne, has\r\n  often bought books in languages of which he knew not a single\r\n  word, merely because they were beautifully bound or very scarce.’\r\n\r\nFrom another letter:—\r\n\r\n  ‘I have not time nor space to lengthen my letter, or I should tell\r\n  you of a long conversation I had last Sunday at Lady Lucan’s\r\n  blue-stocking conversazione with Lord Macartney about you. He has\r\n  just come from Ireland and wanted to know whether you were\r\n  recovered—whether you come to London this winter, as he wished to\r\n  communicate some memorandums he made in perusing your “Irish Tour”\r\n  while he was in Ireland. He is a charming man, to my mind.\r\n\r\n  ‘Poor Fanny[144] has been very ill indeed, and we have been in\r\n  expectation of her coming to nurse, but she will risk the dying at\r\n  her Majesty’s feet to show her zeal before she can be spared, I\r\n  suppose.\r\n\r\n  ‘I have had the great Haydn here, and think him as _good_ a\r\n  creature as _great_ Musician. As to operas, the Pantheon\r\n  advertises to open as a theatre; it is the most elegant in Europe,\r\n  Pacchierotti says, but it has great enemies. The Haymarket folks\r\n  have not yet obtained a licence, at which they affect surprise,\r\n  though they were told so before their building was a foot high.\r\n  Old Mingotti is come over with her scholar Madame Lobo, the\r\n  intended first woman of the Haymarket.

But a listless and irresolute\r\n  disposition has made my mind for some time past as flimsy as a\r\n  dish-clout, and I must _confess_ that I have invariably \"left\r\n  undone those things which I _ought_ to have done\"—“for there was\r\n  no health in me,” indeed, not enough to enable me “to do many\r\n  things which I _ought not_ to have done.” Original sin and\r\n  depravity just enabled me to _read_ when I should have _written_,\r\n  and to lie in bed when I should have got up, &c. I wished to\r\n  commit other _guess_ crimes than those, to have rambled over a\r\n  great part of the kingdom and revelled with distant friends. But\r\n  prudence, in the shape of rheumatism, and in many other hideous\r\n  shapes, prevented me. Yet, in spite of all these admonitions, I\r\n  had a month’s mind to accept of your hospitable offer. But we have\r\n  guests at our apartments now, my two aged sisters, and, when they\r\n  depart, winter will begin to show his sour face and chain me to my\r\n  chimney corner till after Christmas, when I shall be unfettered,\r\n  merely to be dragged into the hurry and din of London, which are\r\n  every year more and more insupportable. I have long ceased to like\r\n  the country, except in long days and fine weather, and, in winter,\r\n  prefer London with all its horrors and fatigues to rural\r\n  amusements. Indeed, autumn with all its golden glow and variegated\r\n  charms for landscape painters is to me a constant _memento mori_,\r\n  with its withered leaves tumbling about my ears; and all my most\r\n  severe attacks of rheumatism have been during the equinoctial\r\n  winds and rains; so that I am afraid of trusting myself far from\r\n  home at this season of the year, as one can be sick and cross\r\n  nowhere so _comfortably_ as at home.\r\n\r\n  ‘Having scribbled my apology, I must now hasten to congratulate\r\n  you and Mrs. Young on the marriage of our dear and worthy girl\r\n  Bessy.[145] The match, indeed, is not splendid for either in point\r\n  of circumstances; but they are quite as likely to scramble happily\r\n  through life, with good hearts and wishes limited to their means,\r\n  as the richest peers and peeresses in the land, who generally\r\n  outlive their income, be it what it will, and have mortifications\r\n  incident to pride and disappointed ambition which little folk know\r\n  nothing about. They (I mean our young couple) have my hearty\r\n  benediction and good wishes. A man without family attachments is\r\n  an awkward and insulated being, but a woman without a mate is\r\n  still more insignificant and helpless; and, having become\r\n  adventurers in the matrimonial lottery, I sincerely hope they will\r\n  gain a prize in the fortuitous distribution of such happiness as\r\n  reasonable mortals have a right to expect.\r\n\r\n  ‘I dare not venture on French politics. What a marvellous period\r\n  in the history of that nation! I think the clergy and many worthy\r\n  people of the lower class of nobility have been cruelly used, and\r\n  that the mob is at present too powerful and insolent. Too much has\r\n  been promised them, and nothing short of an agrarian law will\r\n  satisfy them. The word tax, _taille_, impost, are carefully\r\n  avoided in the National Chart. But they must be levied under some\r\n  denomination or other, and, I fancy, “contribution” will be as\r\n  detestable a term in France, ere long, as “free-gift” was in\r\n  England during the last century. I wish the worthy people of\r\n  France may enjoy the rational liberty which seems now in their\r\n  power, but I question whether the inhabitants of that kingdom in\r\n  general will deserve the ample liberty which is offered them, or\r\n  know how to use it. I think them so fickle and frivolous that I\r\n  should not be surprised if in a few years they were as tired of\r\n  their new Government as the English at the death of Oliver\r\n  Cromwell. In the meantime what has happened in America and France\r\n  will shake every sovereignty upon earth. The French Guards laying\r\n  down their arms when ordered to fire on the mob will make mobs\r\n  formidable things in every country, for whenever a similar\r\n  defection happens a revolution must be the consequence.\r\n\r\n  ‘I am sorry not to be able to give your friend, Mr. Capel Lofft,\r\n  an account of any Lyre in modern times having been in use that has\r\n  been constructed, strung, and tuned on the principles of the\r\n  antients. Innumerable volumes have been written on their division\r\n  of the scale and genera. Kircher, indeed, calls a Vielle a\r\n  hurdy-gurdy, Lyra mendicorum. And a Viol da Gamba, with additional\r\n  strings and new tuning, was in the last century called a\r\n  Lyra-Viol. Mace,[146] Playford,[147] Simpson,[148] I believe, and\r\n  others describe this instrument. But though many modern\r\n  instruments have had the honour of being called Lyres, yet none of\r\n  them resemble the antient in their form or in the manner of\r\n  playing them. The Mandoline is the only modern instrument played\r\n  with anything like a plectrum. Vicenzio Galileo, the father of\r\n  Galileo, in his tract, “Della Musica antica e moderna,” published\r\n  at Florence 1602, speaks much of the similarity of the antient\r\n  Lyre and Cythara, but gives more proof from antient authors of\r\n  their _difference_ than _identity_. He tells us, however, that\r\n  “the modern Harp, which is nothing but the antient Cythara with\r\n  many strings, was brought into Italy from Ireland.” Now the Irish\r\n  harp is a single instrument of few strings, partly brass and\r\n  partly steel, and of such small compass as to admit no bass, being\r\n  confined to mere melody. Carolan, the celebrated modern Irish\r\n  Bard, played only the treble part of tunes. And it seems to me as\r\n  if this simple instrument resembled the antient Lyre and Cythara\r\n  more than any other modern instrument with which I am acquainted.\r\n  Pray tell Mr. Lofft that I have examined Bonanni’s description of\r\n  all the musical instruments that are known, with engravings of\r\n  them all, but found nothing satisfactory about a modern Lyre. This\r\n  book was published at Rome 1722. I have likewise looked into\r\n  Ceruti’s new edition with corrections, 1776, without success.\r\n\r\n           ‘I am, my dear friend,\r\n                            ‘Yours affectionately,\r\n                                           ‘CHARLES BURNEY.’\r\n\r\nFrom Dr. John Symonds on the political state of the country—an\r\naccount of a conference between Mr. Pitt and the Duke of Grafton:—\r\n\r\n                             ‘Bates’ Hotel, Adelphi: April 19, 1791.\r\n\r\n  ‘My dear Young,—Hope you will not expect to hear me talking on\r\n  Agriculture; of that you will have a sufficient taste from seeing\r\n  the wonderful knowledge exhibited by all the House of Commons in\r\n  the Corn Bill. You will look for something on politics, though the\r\n  newspapers themselves sufficiently show the straits to which Mr.\r\n  Pitt is driven; for his majority is such as will ruin any Minister\r\n  if a war be unpopular; and had the American war been so at first,\r\n  it is not probable that Lord North would have dared to pursue it,\r\n  though he was so strongly supported in Parliament.\r\n\r\n  ‘The truth is, some of Mr. Pitt’s bosom friends absolutely refuse\r\n  to vote with him on this occasion. Among these are Wilberforce and\r\n  Banks. The Duke of Grafton desired his son-in-law, Mr. Smith, to\r\n  tell Mr. Pitt he wished to have some conversation with him; Mr.\r\n  Pitt very politely came and staid half-an-hour, and the Duke used\r\n  every argument he could think of to convince him, both of the\r\n  impolicy and injustice of the war, \"that the augmentation of taxes\r\n  coming upon the neck of the cessed ones, and malt tax, which made\r\n  a great noise, would occasion universal discontent, if not worse\r\n  effects; that we ought to lay no stress upon the promises of a\r\n  Turkish Ministry and advantages in the Turkey trade, which must\r\n  chiefly accrue to France from her situation, and other causes;\r\n  that what we could do in the Baltic was merely to burn a few\r\n  villages and distress individuals, as the Russian fleet would lie\r\n  securely among rocks, that Russia appeared to act with moderation\r\n  in desiring to retain Ockzakow only; and that to plunge this\r\n  nation into a vast expense, merely to serve the King of Prussia’s\r\n  views, when we could obtain no benefit from it, would expose the\r\n  Ministry to very great censure, more especially as we entered into\r\n  it as volunteers, not being obliged to it by the terms of the\r\n  Treaty.\" Other things which his Grace said I omit, as every\r\n  argument has been used in the House of Commons. The conference\r\n  ended as conferences of this sort generally do—each of them kept\r\n  to his opinion.\r\n\r\n  ‘You observe probably in the papers, that on Baker’s motion, Pole\r\n  Carew moved the previous question and contended “that the\r\n  interests of all are closely connected even in respect to things\r\n  not stipulated by treaty.” This judicious doctrine was first\r\n  advanced by the Chancellor, and Mr. Pitt defended in his speech on\r\n  Baker’s motion. According to this doctrine, there is no difference\r\n  between defensive and offensive treaties; all the writer’s _de\r\n  jure gentium_ should be burnt, and, indeed, most of the European\r\n  treaties also; and it is certain that under such circumstances\r\n  England ought never to make an alliance on the Continent unless a\r\n  Continental war were actually broken out; otherwise she could not\r\n  foresee the consequences to which she would be exposed.\r\n\r\n  ‘Charles Fox said in his speech on Baker’s motion “that Mr. Pitt\r\n  dared not to enter into the war, and that he kept a majority\r\n  together at present by his assurance that there would not be one.”\r\n\r\n  ‘This is, perhaps, the case; but however it may be, it is certain\r\n  that Faukner, Clerk of the Council, is sent to Berlin, and most\r\n  persons think with a view of showing the King of Prussia the\r\n  impossibility of persuading this country to enter into a Russian\r\n  war. Had Mr. Pitt felt the pulse of the Parliament and people\r\n  before he delivered the King’s message, he would have saved his\r\n  credit, though he might have been blamed; but he has now run into\r\n  the horns of a dilemma, as the logicians call it. If he prosecute\r\n  the war, he will infallibly be ex-Minister, and bad consequences\r\n  are to be apprehended in a country oppressed by taxes and heated\r\n  by political pamphlets; if he give it ‘up, he will lose all his\r\n  influence in the eyes of Europe, and teach foreign Courts that no\r\n  confidence is to be placed in an English Minister. His friends\r\n  lament very much this last circumstance.\r\n\r\n                                               ‘Adieu!\r\n                                                      JOHN SYMONDS.’\r\n\r\nA circumstance in the exploits of my public career which made,\r\nperhaps, a more general impression than any other event of my life,\r\nwas the proposal in 1792 for arming the property of the Kingdom in a\r\nsort of horse militia. My first suggestion of this idea was in May\r\n(of that year). Should any have claimed it, or should any hereafter\r\nform such a claim, it ought in truth and strict candour to be\r\nabsolutely rejected. The proposal was more formally made in August\r\nof the same year in the ‘Annals,’ vol. xviii. p. 495, under the\r\ntitle of French events.[149] In the end of 1792 and the beginning of\r\n1793 these papers were collected and much enlarged in a pamphlet\r\nentitled, ‘The Example of France,’ &c. which ran speedily through\r\nfour numerous editions, and excited a very general attention. The\r\nauthor was publicly thanked in resolutions of associated assemblies,\r\nand my great plea of a horse militia produced almost immediately\r\nthree volunteer corps of cavalry, which multiplied rapidly through\r\nthe Kingdom. It is not known that any persons or any bodies of men\r\never laid claim to a priority in this idea; accordingly my health\r\nwas the first toast given for being the origin of those corps,\r\nwhich, when assembled, had this opportunity of publicly declaring\r\ntheir opinion. The scheme took with astonishing celerity, and became\r\nthe parent of a measure of a very different complexion, which was\r\nputting arms into the hands of thousands without property, and upon\r\nwhose allegiance and constitutional principle but little reliance\r\ncould be placed. Government received demands for arms to the amount\r\nof above 700,000 men. The Ministers were alarmed, and saw too late\r\nthe consequence of their own blindness and incapacity. They refused\r\ntheir consent, in many cases without properly discriminating between\r\nmen with and without property, and felt themselves in so awkward a\r\nposition that it is no wonder their conduct continued void of any\r\nsteady adherence to the principle of the original proposition. Had\r\nmy plan not only been adopted but carried into execution, strictly\r\nupon the principles I had explained, we might from that moment to\r\nthe present have had a horse militia, absolutely under the command\r\nof Government, numbering from 100,000 to 200,000 men, which might,\r\nby progressive improvements, have been matured into a force\r\nefficient for every purpose. It is very seldom that so private an\r\nindividual can by a happy thought become the origin of a system\r\nwhich, had my principles been steadily adhered to, would have been\r\nattended with inconceivable benefit, and none of those evils, real\r\nor imaginary, afterwards attributed to volunteers in general.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet rendered the author exceedingly popular among all the\r\nfriends of government and order, and as unpopular among the whole\r\nrace of reformers and Jacobins. I was not content with the mere\r\ntheoretical idea, but in my own person put it into practice, and\r\nenrolled myself in the ranks of a corps raised at my recommendation,\r\nin the vicinity of Bury [St. Edmunds], and commanded by the present\r\nMarquis of Cornwallis, then Lord Broome, having with this intention\r\nlearnt the sword exercise at London of a sergeant, who was eminently\r\nskilled in it. My example was followed by gentlemen of fortune,\r\nseveral of whom were also in the ranks and refused to be officers.\r\nThis was a part of the plan of particular importance, for had\r\ngentlemen accepted only the situation of officers, the spirit of\r\nentering the corps among yeomen, farmers &c. would have been much\r\ncooler; but when they saw their landlords, and men of high\r\nconsideration in the neighbourhood, in the same situation, their\r\nvanity was flattered, and they enrolled themselves with great\r\nreadiness, and the great object of property of such importance in\r\ncase of revolutionary disturbance was thus secured.\r\n\r\nSome years afterwards, being at the Duke of Bedford’s at Woburn, I\r\nsat at dinner by a gentleman of great property, captain of a troop\r\nof yeomanry, who told me that whenever his troop met he always drank\r\nmy health after the King’s, for being the undisputed origin of all\r\nthe yeomanry corps in the kingdom, possibly arising from extracts\r\nfrom my writings on the subject having been much circulated in the\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nThis year my valuable and very sincere friend, the Earl of Orford,\r\ndied. The public papers that have announced the death of this noble\r\nlord have recorded the ancestry from which he was descended, the\r\nheirs of his honours, and the inheritors of his wealth, and have\r\ndwelt upon the titles that are extinct or devolved, together with\r\nall the posts and employments that are vacant. To me be the\r\nmelancholy duty of noting what is of much more moment than the\r\ndescent of a peerage or the transfer of an estate—the loss of an\r\nanimated improver; of one who gave importance to cultivation by a\r\nthorough knowledge of political economy, and bent all his endeavours\r\ntowards making mankind happy by seconding the pursuits of the farmer\r\nand the enquiries of the experimentalist. I leave the lieutenancy of\r\na county, the rangership of a park, and the honours of the\r\nbedchamber to those in whose eyes such baubles are respectable. I\r\nwould rather dwell on the merit of the first importer of Southdown\r\nsheep into Norfolk; on the merit of sending to the most distant\r\nregions for breeds of animals, represented as useful, not indeed\r\nalways with success, but never without liberality in the motive; on\r\nthe patron and friend of the common farmer, not the lord of a little\r\ncircle of tenants, but the general and diffusive encourager of every\r\nspecies of agricultural improvement. Nor did he associate with the\r\nuseful men because he was not qualified for the company of higher\r\nclasses, for his mind was fraught with a great extent of knowledge;\r\nit was decorated by no trivial stores of classical learning, which\r\nexercised and set off the powers of a brilliant imagination, and\r\nthus qualified, alike for a Court or an Academy of Science, he felt\r\nno degradation in attending to THE PLOUGH. By the death of this\r\nnoble personage the ‘Annals’ have lost a valuable correspondent, and\r\ntheir editor a warm friend. Notwithstanding the immense list of\r\nPeers, seven or eight only have become correspondents in this work.\r\nThe insects of a drawing-room, the patrons of faro, the luminaries\r\nof Newmarket, are spared; while the hand of death deprives the\r\nfarmer of a friend, Norfolk of a protector, and England of a real\r\npatriot.\r\n\r\nLord Loughborough was the Judge at the Summer Assizes this year at\r\nBury, and I being on the Grand Jury, he sent a note to inform me\r\nthat he was alone at his lodgings, and desired me to come and chat\r\nwith him. This I did, of course, and in our conversation he\r\nmentioned that there was an estate of 4,400 acres of land in\r\nYorkshire on the moors, in the vicinity of Paitley Bridge, to be\r\nsold for 4,000_l._, that it was chiefly freehold, and enclosed with\r\na ring fence, also that there was a neat shooting-box on it built by\r\nthe Duke of Devonshire, who hired the grouse. I assured his Lordship\r\nthat he must be mistaken, for it was impossible that such a tract of\r\nland under several circumstances which he named could be on sale for\r\nhalf an hour without being purchased. He answered that nobody would\r\nbuy it, as the land was all moor or peat, and covered with ling, but\r\nthat some neighbouring farmers gave, he believed, 100l. per annum\r\nfor the whole as a walk for mountain sheep. I told him that it\r\nseemed so extraordinary to me that I would go immediately to view\r\nit. He said the proper persons to apply to to view it were Sir Cecil\r\nWray, Dr. Kilvington, and another gentleman. I accordingly went\r\nimmediately to Yorkshire, and, taking up my quarters at Paitley\r\nBridge, enquired till I found a person who knew the whole estate\r\nperfectly well, and engaged him early the next morning in order to\r\nmake the tour of the whole property. It appeared to me to be\r\nwonderfully improvable, and that very considerable tracts to the\r\namount of some hundred acres were palpably capable of irrigation and\r\nimprovement, evidently applicable from the case of a small\r\nwatercourse for conducting the water to an old smelting mill, but\r\nlong neglected. This course had overflowed and converted the ling,\r\nover about fifteen acres, to grass. I asked my conductor what this\r\ngrass would let for with a small cottage and stable for cows; he\r\nsaid, ‘Certainly fifteen shillings an acre.’ It was sufficiently\r\nevident that improvements might be wrought at a very small expense,\r\nand that building was remarkably cheap, from every material except\r\ntimber being found on the spot, and lime at a small distance. There\r\nwas a small farm in cultivation to produce oats, and the appearance\r\nnot unfavourable. As I knew that a land surveyor well acquainted\r\nwith all this country resided at Leeds, I determined to go thither\r\nto bring him over to view, and give his opinion as to the value of\r\nthe property. This I did, brought him over in a postchaise, and rode\r\nwith him over the principal part of the estate. His opinion\r\nconfirmed my own, nor must I forget to mention that this estate was\r\nto be purchased without money as it was offered on its own security\r\nin mortgage.\r\n\r\nIn the enclosure of this immense waste, called forest, there were\r\ntwo allotments purchased by the proprietors, one of 1,638 acres, and\r\nanother of 1,113, in all 2,751 acres, which were a copyhold tenure,\r\nat a small fine certain. In addition to which they hired, at the\r\nsame time, on a long lease, 1,614 acres more, being an allotment to\r\nthe King, at a rent of 50_l._ in money, and 50_l._ to be laid out on\r\nimprovements. The whole, situated half-way between Knaresboro’ and\r\nSkipton, I found walled in; three farm-houses built, with barns and\r\noffices of various sorts, and lands annexed, and partly subdivided,\r\nto the amount of about 400 acres; the remaining 4,000 in one vast\r\nwaste. These farms produced the rent of 44_l._ 5_s._ The game was\r\nlet at 30_l._ with the use of a handsome shooting-box, sufficient\r\nfor the residence of a small family. Peat dug from the bogs produced\r\nfrom 6_l._ to 8_l._ a year; and the great waste was let at 100_l._ a\r\nyear, which, for 4,000 acres, is at the rate of sixpence per acre.\r\nThe annual rental was therefore about 181_l._ per annum. From these\r\ncircumstances it appeared clear to me that the purchase could not\r\nwell be an unfavourable speculation. 2,750 acres (throwing the\r\nleasehold entirely out of the question) for 4,400_l._ is exactly\r\n32_l._ an acre fee simple for land that paid a mere trifle in poor\r\nrates and land tax,[150] and tithe free; it did not seem therefore\r\nto be necessary that the produce should amount to three shillings,\r\nfor if the rent was reckoned only at one shilling it was but\r\nthirty-two years’ purchase. I determined, therefore, to make it, and\r\nconcluded the transaction as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMy plan was, to let my farm in Suffolk, of about 300 acres, and\r\ntransfer the capital, with some additions, to the gradual\r\nimprovement of this large tract; and, in doing this, I should have\r\nbegun with one farm on the Southern extremity, near the turnpike\r\nroad, of three or four hundred acres, let separately for 20_l._ a\r\nyear, but all a waste, and, in addition to this, have run a watering\r\ncanal from one of the streams, till from 100 to 200 acres were below\r\nthe level, walling such tract in. Thus prepared, I found myself at\r\nlast in a situation to realise the speculations I had so long been\r\nbusy in—when a new scene of a very different kind opened upon me—but\r\nof that hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe following are the letters of this year reserved. From J.\r\nSymonds, Esq., an account of the Duke of Grafton’s illness:—\r\n\r\n                                             ‘Euston: Jan. 30, 1792.\r\n\r\n  ‘So you tell me that I know not how to stay at home! but this is a\r\n  visit of pure friendship, for the duke likes very well to chat\r\n  with me, though he is so nervous as hardly to bear with strangers.\r\n  Yesterday Lord Clermont, who is very intimate with him, came\r\n  hither, but he was too much for the duke, and had he not gone away\r\n  this morning, the duchess would have hinted it gently to him. What\r\n  would you do with such nerves?\r\n\r\n  ‘Last night, instead of reading a sermon or charge, I read to the\r\n  whole company (by the duke’s desire) your essays on the place of\r\n  corn and capital employed in the French husbandry, with which he\r\n  had been so pleased. Lord Clermont, who has lived much in France,\r\n  and though a man of pleasure, had inquired much into the state of\r\n  that country, was not more delighted than surprised with them.\r\n  “Well, then,” said the duke, “as you like them so much and intend\r\n  to buy the book, recommend it as much as possible to your friends\r\n  in the great world.” This he engaged to do. His Lordship gave a\r\n  pressing invitation for you and I to pass two or three days with\r\n  him; he fixed upon the month of May, which will suit me, and, I\r\n  hope, you.\r\n\r\n  ‘As an inducement I was to tell you that he has marled four\r\n  hundred and fifty acres with a hundred and twenty loads an\r\n  acre—this is an object.\r\n\r\n                                                        ‘J SYMONDS.’\r\n\r\nJ. W. Coke, Esq., M.P., proposing some laws for the benefit of the\r\npoor in their present distress:—\r\n\r\n                                            ‘Holkham: Oct. 23, 1792.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—I have no better motive to urge for addressing myself\r\n  to you upon the subject of this letter than that I know of no man\r\n  so well qualified as yourself to give me the information I stand\r\n  in need of, should my plan be thought practicable and useful by\r\n  you, otherwise I should take shame to myself to intrude for a\r\n  moment on your time, which I esteem so precious, as it is always\r\n  most usefully employed in the most laudable pursuits.\r\n\r\n  ‘Having turned my thoughts much of late to the most probable\r\n  causes of the discontent among the lower classes of people in this\r\n  country, I find that the high price of provisions, especially of\r\n  bread, has been invariably the motive assigned by them whenever\r\n  they have assembled in a tumultuous manner. And this is not\r\n  surprising, as the existence of a poor man’s family must depend\r\n  upon that last-mentioned necessary article, most truly his staff\r\n  of life. It is surely, then, the interest, as well as the duty, of\r\n  the landed proprietors to endeavour by every means that can be\r\n  devised that the poor may never suffer in this respect. Now, it\r\n  has occurred to me that perhaps a Bill might be framed to fix an\r\n  assize on flour according to the average price of wheat.\r\n\r\n  ‘That millers should be obliged to grind for all persons at a\r\n  certain sum per bushel instead of toll; persons being at liberty\r\n  to inspect their corn whilst grinding, and that allowance should\r\n  be made to millers for any alleged deficiency in grinding. All\r\n  complaints to be heard in a summary way before a Justice of the\r\n  Peace, and the complaint to be made within six days. The average\r\n  price of wheat to be taken from the nearest market at the\r\n  discretion of the Justice. Penal clauses should also be enacted\r\n  against millers adulterating wheat and mixing water with the meal\r\n  to increase its weight.\r\n\r\n  ‘These loose hints I submit to your superior judgment and better\r\n  information; but, from my own observation, I do suspect the poor\r\n  suffer greatly from the shameful practices and combinations of the\r\n  millers, which I should be proud to check by bringing a Bill into\r\n  Parliament as one of the representatives of the great arable\r\n  county, should you approve the idea and would have the goodness to\r\n  lend me your assistance in framing the Bill.\r\n\r\n  ‘I must also mention another cruel grievance to the poor, that\r\n  there is no legal restraint on shopkeepers in villages respecting\r\n  their weights and measures.\r\n\r\n  ‘Could no means be devised to protect the buyer from the artifices\r\n  of the seller without injury to the latter in their honest gains?\r\n  Why might not magistrates have the power of punishing for short\r\n  weights and measures, complaint to be made within six days?\r\n\r\n                          ‘I remain, dear Sir.\r\n                                       ‘Yours very sincerely,\r\n                                                       ‘J. W. COKE.’\r\n\r\nFrom Dr. Burney on my ‘Travels’ and his own engagements:—\r\n\r\n                                    ‘Chelsea College: July 17, 1792.\r\n\r\n  ‘My dear Friend,—Your very kind and hearty invitation to Bradfield\r\n  came at a time when I was utterly unable to answer it. I was just\r\n  emerged from the sick room into daily hurry and business, for\r\n  which I was but little fit, and am still detained here by an\r\n  unusual number of engagements for this time of year, the end of\r\n  which I am not able to see. If my _patients_ had walked off as\r\n  early as I wished them, or if, like other _doctors_, I could have\r\n  them put to their long home by a dash of my pen, I really believe\r\n  I should not have been able to resist the lure you threw out; but\r\n  now, if I am able to travel, or fit for any house but my own, I\r\n  have two positive engagements on my hands of long standing: the\r\n  first to Mickleham, to my daughter, Phillips, where I promised, as\r\n  soon as I could pronounce myself a convalescent, to go and\r\n  complete my cure; the other is to Crewe Hall, in Cheshire, whither\r\n  I have been going more than twice seven years; and at which place\r\n  I was so sure of arriving last August, that my correspondents, at\r\n  my request, addressed their letters to me there. This year the\r\n  claims upon me and Fanny have been so powerfully renewed by Mrs.\r\n  Crewe that nothing but increased indisposition can resist them.\r\n  She has promised to carry us down by slow journeys, and, if it\r\n  should be necessary for me to go to Buxton for my confounded\r\n  rheumatism (which, though less painful, still deprives me of all\r\n  use of my left paw), she will even accompany me thither. My poor\r\n  wife is also in sad health, and we are neither of us fit for\r\n  anything but to _con ailments_ with those who are as old and\r\n  infirm as ourselves. But we send you a splinter[151] from us,\r\n  before we were quite broke up and unfit for service. It is not\r\n  sufficient to improve your fire of a wet day, but may perhaps be\r\n  of some little use in the way of kindling.\r\n\r\n  ‘I thank you heartily for your very interesting book of “Travels.”\r\n  It is in public perusal of an evening, and has fastened on us. The\r\n  parts of France which you have traversed were to me almost\r\n  unknown. I never saw the Loire or the Garonne. No one can accuse\r\n  you of drowsiness, like old Homer and such folks; you are always\r\n  awake, and keep your readers so. We are now in the midst of that\r\n  most astonishing of all events, the French Revolution, and like\r\n  your narrative extremely. Though an enemy to the old tyranny, you\r\n  neither reason about the rights of man like Wat Tyler or even Tom\r\n  Payne. You saw coming on all the evils which anarchy has\r\n  occasioned. You have long seen the futility of theory without\r\n  practice among French agriculturists, and the political\r\n  philosophers who think themselves wiser than the experiences of\r\n  all antiquity, and not content with anything already done, must\r\n  needs set about inventing an entire new government, and you see\r\n  what a fine mess they have made of it.\r\n\r\n                                      ‘Yours ever,\r\n                                                   ‘CHARLES BURNEY.’\r\n\r\nFrom Miss Burney, afterwards Mdme. d’Arblay, writing on some traits\r\nof my character, &c.:—\r\n\r\n                                    ‘Chelsea College: July 17, 1792.\r\n\r\n  ‘Nay, if you talk of your difficulties in fabricating an epistle\r\n  to me, please to consider how much greater are mine in attempting\r\n  to answer it. You! a country farmer, the acknowledged head of “the\r\n  _only art worth cultivating_,” as you tell us,—the contemner of\r\n  every other pursuit, the scorner of all old customs, the defier of\r\n  all musty authorities, the derider of all fogrum superiors,—in one\r\n  word a Jacobin. You afraid? and of whom? a Chelsea pensioner? One\r\n  who, maimed in the royal service, ignobly forbears, spurning royal\r\n  reparation? One who, though flying a court, degenerately refrains\r\n  from hating or even reviling kings, queens, and princesses? One\r\n  who presumes to wish as well to manufactures for her outside, as\r\n  to agriculture for her inside? One who has the ignorance to\r\n  reverence commerce, and who cannot think of a single objection to\r\n  the Wool Bill? One, in short, and to say all that is abominable at\r\n  once, one who in theory is an aristocrat, and in practice a\r\n  _ci-devant_ courtier?\r\n\r\n  ‘And shall a creature of this description, the willing advocate of\r\n  every opinion, every feeling you excommunicate from “your business\r\n  and bosom,” _dare_ to write to _you_? Impossible!\r\n\r\n  ‘Whether I shall come and see you all or not is another matter. If\r\n  I can I will.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ‘P.S. Will Honeycomb says if you would know anything of a lady’s\r\n  meaning (always providing she has any) when she writes to you,\r\n  look at her postscript. Now pray, dear sir, how came you ever to\r\n  imagine what you are pleased to blazon to the world with all the\r\n  confidence of self-belief, that you think farming the only thing\r\n  worth manly attention? You, who, if taste rather than circumstance\r\n  had been your guide, might have found wreaths and flowers almost\r\n  any way you had turned, as fragrant as those of Ceres.’\r\n\r\nMy reply:—\r\n\r\n  ‘You, “the willing advocate of every feeling I excommunicate from\r\n  my bosom,” knew you had thrown so bitter a potion into your letter\r\n  that you could not (kind creature!) help a little sweetening in\r\n  the postscript; but must there in your sweets be some alloy? Could\r\n  you not conclude without falling foul of poor Ceres?\r\n\r\n  ‘Your letter, or rather your profession of faith, is one of the\r\n  worst political creeds I remember to have read; you see no merit\r\n  but beneath a diadem. In government a professed aristocrat, in\r\n  political economy a monopolist, who commends manufactures, not as\r\n  a market for the farmer, but for the much nobler purpose of\r\n  contributing to adorn your _outside_; and who can attain not one\r\n  better idea of the immortal plough than that of giving some\r\n  sustenance to your _inside_. But, by the way, is not that inside\r\n  of yours an equivoque? Do you mean your real or your metaphorical\r\n  inside, your ribs or your feelings? If you allude to your brains,\r\n  they are by your own account a _wool_-gathering. Do you mean your\r\n  heart, and that the philosophical contemplation of so pure an\r\n  engine as the plough is the sustenance of your best emotions? How\r\n  will that agree with the panegyrist of a court and the satirist of\r\n  a farm? Or is it that this inside of yours is a mere bread and\r\n  cheese cupboard, which, certes, the plough can furnish? Or is it a\r\n  magic lanthorn full of gay delusions, lighted by tallow from the\r\n  belly of a sheep? Till you have settled these doubts, I know not\r\n  which you prefer, manufactures for improving your complection, or\r\n  agriculture for farming your heart. Nor must you wonder at such\r\n  questions arising while you use terms that leave one in doubt\r\n  whether you mean your head or your tail. I know something of the\r\n  one; the other is a metaphor. Though there is high treason against\r\n  the plough in almost every line of your letter, yet the words _If\r\n  I can I will_ are not in the spirit that contains the Eleusinian\r\n  mysteries; they bring balm to my wounded feelings.’\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 139:\r\n\r\n  These letters were sold by Sotheby, Wilkinson & Co., London,\r\n  December 1896.\r\n\r\nFootnote 140:\r\n\r\n  Louis d’or at this time worth 24 francs.—_Littré._\r\n\r\nFootnote 141:\r\n\r\n  The well-known Colonel George Hanger, afterwards fourth Lord\r\n  Coleraine. ‘He served in the Army during the American War, and was\r\n  afterwards a distinguished character in high society.

I have examined every part of the kingdom, and have\r\n  farming correspondents in all the counties.\r\n\r\n  ‘It is impossible I should know what is your intention in relation\r\n  to the office of the secretary; but the same wisdom that\r\n  established the Board will, without doubt, give such an\r\n  appointment to that office as may fill it in a manner the best\r\n  adapted to the business.\r\n\r\n  ‘Should I be happy enough to appear in your eyes qualified for\r\n  such a post, and you would have the goodness to name me to it, it\r\n  might lessen the anxieties of a life that has been passed in the\r\n  service of the national agriculture; and I should feel with\r\n  unvarying gratitude the obligation of the favour.\r\n\r\n  ‘I have the honour to be, sir, with the greatest respect,\r\n\r\n                    ‘Your most humble and obedient servant,\r\n                                                     ‘ARTHUR YOUNG.’\r\n\r\nMy reply to George Rose, Esq., on his communicating to me Mr. Pitt’s\r\napprobation of my appointment:—\r\n\r\n                                      ‘Bradfield Hall: May 30, 1793.\r\n\r\n  ‘Sir,—It is with pleasure that I acknowledge the receipt of your\r\n  letter, as it shows that, whatever may be the result of the\r\n  present business, my exertions have met with the approbation of\r\n  Government, whose public-spirited and laudable views I have long\r\n  been solicitous to second.\r\n\r\n  ‘The salary you mention is, I confess, less than I imagined would\r\n  be assigned to the office, but its being adequate or not depends\r\n  entirely on the circumstances of attendance, duty, residence, &c.\r\n  If these be arranged on a footing any way liberal, the sum is\r\n  equal to my desires; and I shall in that case accept the office\r\n  with pleasure. If, on the contrary, these points be so fixed as to\r\n  overturn my present pursuits in life, they would render a larger\r\n  salary less valuable to me than the sum you mention.\r\n\r\n  ‘From the nature of the Board, intended to consist, as I\r\n  understand, of members of the two Houses, with the objects in\r\n  view, I take it for granted that the points above mentioned may,\r\n  without the least impediment to the business, be easily arranged.\r\n  ‘Trusting in this entirely to Mr. Pitt and yourself, I beg your\r\n  good offices that, if I should have improperly expressed my\r\n  meaning, you will do me the justice to rely on the integrity of my\r\n  views, and not imagine me eager in making a bargain for profit\r\n  with a great and liberal benefactor.\r\n\r\n                             ‘I have the honour to remain &c.\r\n                                                     ‘ARTHUR YOUNG.’\r\n\r\nWhat a change in the destination of a man’s life! Instead of\r\nbecoming the solitary lord of four thousand acres, in the keen\r\natmosphere of lofty rocks, and mountain torrents, with a little\r\ncreation rising gradually around me, making the black desert smile\r\nwith cultivation, and grouse give way to industrious population,\r\nactive and energetic, though remote and tranquil, and, every instant\r\nof my existence, making _two blades of grass to grow_ where not one\r\nwas found before—behold me at a desk in the smoke, the fog, the din\r\nof Whitehall. ‘Society has charms’—true; and so has solitude to a\r\nmind employed. But the die is cast, and my steps may still be said,\r\nmetaphorically, to be in the furrow. My pleasures are of another\r\nsort; I see daily a noble activity of zeal in the service of the\r\nnational husbandry in the President—of that happy effort of royal\r\npatriotism, commendable and exemplary; and I see in so many great\r\nand distinguished characters such a disinterested attention to the\r\npublic good, and such liberality of spirit in promoting it, that the\r\nview is cheering, whether in a capital or a desert.\r\n\r\nThe two situations were incompatible with each other. I therefore\r\nadvertised the estate for sale; and nothing proves to me how very\r\nill understood waste lands are in this kingdom than the\r\nadvertisement being repeated near a twelvemonth before I could sell\r\nit with much less profit than I had reason to expect. So large a\r\ncontiguous tract, in many respects so eligible for improvement, I\r\nthought would have been a favourite object with numbers; as to the\r\nignorance of those who _viewed_ and _rejected_ it, I can only pity\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe attention I received from individuals was, however, very\r\nflattering, for I find, by an old memorandum book, that I dined out\r\nfrom twenty-five to thirty days in the month, and had, in that time,\r\nforty invitations from people of the highest rank and consequence.\r\nHere I copy a memorandum made at the time: August 21, ‘I feel an\r\nadvancement of a certain kind since the publication of my Travels,\r\nwell calculated to add agreeably to a new sphere in life by means of\r\nthis new Board; but how it will turn out is not easy to conjecture,\r\nand my “Example of France: a Warning to Great Britain”[153] is\r\napplauded in a manner of which I had not the slightest conception.\r\nThe Ministry commend it most highly, and express themselves in [a\r\nway] truly gratifying to my feelings. The last time I was in town,\r\nthe Chancellor dwelt on the idea of how much they were all obliged\r\nto me, and treated me as a man that _must_ be gratified when I was\r\nexplaining my wish to reside but little in London. And Rose’s report\r\nfrom Mr. Pitt was equal; his own expression was that I had beat all\r\nrivalship and produced the most useful work printed on the occasion,\r\n&c. Thus I come with all the advantages I could wish—and I could see\r\nin every eye and hear from every tongue of numbers to whom Sir John\r\nBanks introduced me on the Terrace at Windsor that I was considered\r\nas one to whom the nation was obliged. The King spoke to me, but not\r\nso graciously as some years before; and this brought to my mind a\r\nvisit which Mr. Majendie and his brother, the Canon of Windsor, paid\r\nme at Bradfield, when the latter asked me in a very significant\r\nmanner whether I had not said something against the King’s bull, as\r\nit was commonly reported that I had fallen foul of his Majesty’s\r\ndairy; so I suppose the man who showed me the cattle reported to the\r\nKing every word I had said of them, and possibly with additions. Who\r\nis it that says one should be careful in a court not to offend even\r\na dog? However, Sir J. Sinclair reported to me some days afterwards\r\nthat his Majesty had expressed to him great satisfaction at my\r\nappointment to the secretaryship of the Board.’\r\n\r\nAbout this time I met Sir John Macpherson, from Bengal, but now from\r\nItaly. He came by the Rhine; had a conversation with the King of\r\nPrussia on my ‘Travels,’ which his Majesty was reading, and\r\ncommended greatly. He saw also the Marshal de Castries,[154] who was\r\nlikewise reading them, and praised me in the highest terms. Sir John\r\nMacpherson told him that he had found my accounts of Lombardy so\r\nuncommonly just and accurate that he intended seeing the author as\r\nsoon as he arrived in England. ‘Tell him, then,’ said the marshal,\r\n‘that I did not know France till I read his admirable work, which\r\nastonishes me for its truth, and extent and justness of\r\nobservation;’ and the next day he wrote to him pointing out an error\r\nof mine in the passage relating to his opening the French West\r\nIndies to foreign navigation. No man can speak in higher terms of a\r\nbook than Sir John does of this. He says it is the best that ever\r\nwas published. It is something whimsical that the ladies should tell\r\nme it is as entertaining as a romance, and that statesmen should\r\npraise it for its information. Faith! I had need be flattered to be\r\nkept in good humour—losing my time doing nothing in London in\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n_September 9._—Dined at Pinherring’s, the American ambassador; he is\r\na gentleman-like man; but for his company, though this was a great\r\nentertainment, there was such a motley group as would be difficult\r\nto find; they were so indelicate as to call for a war with England.\r\n\r\nI preserved the following among letters of this year:—\r\n\r\n                   _From the Countess of Bristol_\r\n\r\n                                                   ‘January 4, 1793.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—In spite of a bad cold, which makes me very heavy and\r\n  ill qualified to write to _un homme d’esprit_, I must say a word\r\n  or two in answer to your letter, and also assure you that the one\r\n  you enclosed for Lord Bristol was forwarded by the same post to\r\n  his agent in town.\r\n\r\n  ‘Do I recollect reading your \"Travels\"? Yes, certainly, and the\r\n  great pleasure and instruction I received from them; but the\r\n  approbation, I assure you, came from a better quarter, or I should\r\n  not have presumed on its being worth your acceptance. However that\r\n  may be, I am much pleased with the effect, and fairly confess that\r\n  I did wish to set your pen a-going, because you had _experience_\r\n  and _facts_ to write upon, and that I knew your warm colouring\r\n  would suit the picture—in short, I saw you were a convert. I\r\n  wished you to make others, and if I have been the least\r\n  instrumental by awakening the spark in you, I shall feel that I am\r\n  not wholly useless to the community where providence has placed\r\n  me. I think everybody with talents is called upon, particularly at\r\n  this time, to use them for the good of their once happy country,\r\n  and I know of no one better qualified than yourself to employ your\r\n  eloquence usefully.\r\n\r\n  ‘The pamphlet you mention, of _an earnest address to farmers_, was\r\n  brought to me amongst others, and I immediately said it was\r\n  yours—but pray rescue it from its mangled state and print it again\r\n  as it was written.

It is\r\n  hoped that the Alien Bill may be passed to-morrow, it is so much\r\n  wanted, and that the wretched state of the French armies and their\r\n  dissentions at home may make it unnecessary for us to declare war.\r\n  Three Prussian officers of rank have been arrested for treasonable\r\n  correspondence with Dumouriez, which, they say, is to explain the\r\n  Duke of Brunswick’s retreat; and now it is supposed that Custine’s\r\n  army cannot escape him.\r\n\r\n  ‘I saw two gentlemen who were in Paris a fortnight ago, and who\r\n  told me that the treasury would hold out very little longer, that\r\n  bread was scarce, commerce destroyed, and the people either in\r\n  fury or despair, the whole town affording a melancholy scene of\r\n  poverty, distrust and disorder—houses shut up, public buildings\r\n  destroyed, churches turned into warehouses, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n  ‘For want of better materials I send you a print which I think is\r\n  not a bad one, considering the double part Mr. Fox has acted.

I like it\r\n  very much, and think it is admirably well written, and calculated\r\n  to inform the ignorant and deluded of their real danger. I should\r\n  have told you so long ago, but waited to hear the opinions of\r\n  those from which I thought you would receive more satisfaction;\r\n  and I can now assure you that your pamphlet is much liked by Lord\r\n  Orford and several others of good judgment.

Let the buyers advertise that they wish to change the\r\n  market, and I, though a great heretic against most establishments,\r\n  will be none against them. Adieu! magnanimous Arthur.

I\r\n  could impart to you many fatal instances of the intervention of\r\n  powers by fixing the price and by forcing corn to market.\r\n\r\n  ‘I can show you the thanks of a resident who presided in the\r\n  capital of an extensive district threatened with a famine, and who\r\n  wrote to me asking my opinion upon the following propositions:\r\n  First, “Shall I raise subscriptions to supply the poor with rice\r\n  at this crisis?” _Answer_, “You will thereby not only encourage a\r\n  concourse to your city of persons whose expectations will be\r\n  deceived, as their numbers will exceed the amount of your\r\n  gratuities, and you will thereby destroy many; but you will\r\n  enhance the price in the city.” Secondly, “Shall I compel the\r\n  granaries to be opened, and fix a moderate price?” _Answer_, “By\r\n  no means. You will thereby deter the merchants from bringing grain\r\n  to market, and will thereby starve your inhabitants. Your power\r\n  can only extend to a certain limit, and within that the merchant\r\n  will not enter. If supplies are coming to you, those who have\r\n  grain for sale will have advice of it, and hurry their grain to\r\n  market; but if you compel them, you will stop all imports by such\r\n  forcible interference. Have you calculated at what price the\r\n  merchant buys at a distance, at what expense he brings it, &c.? In\r\n  short, you have the choice of the alternative—whether for a day or\r\n  two you will submit to want, and then be relieved by the exertions\r\n  of those who always hasten to a good market; or whether you will\r\n  gain popularity for a day or two by a compulsory expenditure of\r\n  the quantity within your grasp, and then fall a martyr to an\r\n  exasperated starving people.” He adopted the first, and thanked me\r\n  in the strongest terms.\r\n\r\n  ‘About that time, when Government intended to purchase grain to\r\n  supply certain places, I protested against it, because those\r\n  places would entirely rely upon Government management; for no\r\n  merchant would convey to places where Government by a sudden\r\n  import might overflow the market—if London were to be supplied\r\n  with every want by a contract or monopoly, the effect is easily\r\n  foreseen.\r\n\r\n  ‘In respect to a fixed land tax, I can show you some very\r\n  satisfactory papers upon the subject; as I had to contend against\r\n  some very able advocates for periodical equalisation, and at\r\n  length have obtained a fixed land tax for ever. In Asia we have\r\n  metayers, as in France; we have surveyors of the crop. In short,\r\n  to a gentleman of your philosophic and agricultural turn I may\r\n  prove a welcome referee. To the many pertinent questions you will\r\n  put, you will, no doubt, find many deficient replies, for I am\r\n  conscious of having omitted much. Unluckily I had never seen your\r\n  able productions, and had too often to find the truth by the\r\n  experience of error.\r\n\r\n  ‘Many serious evils may be prevented if a person of your influence\r\n  could have conveyed to Asia your sentiments upon _taxation_, _the\r\n  corn_, _trade_, &c., for the perusal of the several servants\r\n  entrusted with the charge of vast districts with numerous\r\n  industrious subjects. If Necker committed such palpable mistakes\r\n  after so much experience, must not young men in the company’s\r\n  service be subject to fatal errors where the instruction of books\r\n  is not always to be attained, or the advice of the well-informed,\r\n  as in Europe?\r\n\r\n               ‘I remain, with respect, sir,\r\n                                ‘Your most obedient humble servant,\r\n                                                       ‘THOMAS LAW.’\r\n\r\nFrom the Right Hon.

He has not seen anything written in this\r\n  controversy which stands better bottomed upon practical principle,\r\n  or is more likely to produce an effect on the popular mind. It is,\r\n  indeed, incomparably well done. We are all very much obliged to\r\n  Mr. Young, and think the Committee ought to circulate his book.\r\n\r\n  ‘Duke Street, St. James’s: March 5, 1793.’\r\n\r\nFrom Dr. Burney, on my ‘Example of France,’ &c.:—\r\n\r\n                                     ‘Chelsea College: May 12, 1793.\r\n\r\n  ‘My dear Friend,—I cannot let Mrs. Young return without sending\r\n  you my best thanks for the second edition of your excellent\r\n  pamphlet. Indeed, if I were singular in approbation of it, you\r\n  might think me a cleverer fellow than I shall seem among the crowd\r\n  of your admirers. What is a single name in a list fifty yards\r\n  long? And if I were to tell you what numbers of first-rate judges\r\n  have spoke well of your performance, I should want more room than\r\n  Mr. Sheridan’s friends at Glasgow. I shall only just specify those\r\n  who would be at the head of a complete list, if I had time to make\r\n  one: Mr. Burke, Lord Orford, who, on my asking him if he had seen\r\n  your pamphlet, pointed to it, “There it is; I read nothing else;”\r\n  Mrs. Montagu the same; a large party of bluestockings at Lady\r\n  Hesketh’s all agreed that your book and Hannah More’s “Chip”[155]\r\n  were the best on the subject. When I made Mrs. Crewe read the\r\n  first edition, she wrote me word that she had perused it with\r\n  great attention, and that she found it contained stubborn facts,\r\n  to each of which she should say with the grave-digger, “Answer me\r\n  that and unyoke.” Last week, in a note she sent me from Hampstead,\r\n  she says: \"Mr. Arthur Young’s pamphlet makes a great noise, and, I\r\n  think, I never knew any book take more; it is reprinted, you know,\r\n  with additions.\" In the communication of the latter information\r\n  she got the start of me; the second edition could not have been\r\n  out three days but you are meditating a third. I like your\r\n  additions to the second much, particularly what concerns the\r\n  reform of Parliament.\r\n\r\n  ‘I wish you could overhaul Grey’s speech as well as Charles Fox’s\r\n  on that subject, and in an appendix expose the weakness and\r\n  inconsistence of both. Only observe how both confess that there\r\n  _was_ danger to our constitution “from opinions favourable to the\r\n  principles and measures of France,” after so stubbornly and\r\n  pertinaciously denying in Parliament the existence of any such\r\n  danger; challenging Government to prove it, and saying that “the\r\n  Proclamation, call of Parliament, Alien and Traitorous\r\n  Correspondence Bills, were mere Ministerial juggles” to increase\r\n  influence, diminish liberty, and encourage excess of loyalty.\r\n  “But,” says Mr. G. “that _danger_ must now be much lessened, as\r\n  all approbation of those principles, or imitation of that example,\r\n  is now improbable, totally discredited, and removed from all\r\n  political speculation and practice.” What, then, is all the\r\n  defence of France and Frenchmen by the Opposition? And why is\r\n  every measure condemned in Parliament that tends to put an end to\r\n  their anarchy and ambition? Why is war against them so censured?\r\n  Why is it always called the war of kings and despots? Why is the\r\n  Minister so importuned to make peace with regicides and assassins,\r\n  determined to force, if possible, every nation upon earth to adopt\r\n  their measures? Mr. Grey repeats in his speech, “All dread of the\r\n  example is completely removed, and that none could suppose him, or\r\n  any other party in this country, favourable to that example.” What\r\n  is this but open falsehood? Mr. Fox allows that “there _was_ a\r\n  party whose wild theories certainly aimed at an impracticable\r\n  perfection, that could only have been pursued by means subversive\r\n  of every part of our constitution.” Yet there never was any\r\n  danger! Mr. G. says, in express terms, “that his motion extended\r\n  to an alteration in the present government of the country.” But he\r\n  had no specific plan ready of his own, or that he chose to father.\r\n  But as all the petitions he and Mr. Sheridan brought in for a\r\n  reform _demanded_ nothing less than universal suffrage, and as\r\n  these gentlemen either drew up or approved the contents of these\r\n  petitions, we may easily judge what was the general plan of our\r\n  Jacobins, if they could have had the tinkering of the\r\n  constitution.\r\n\r\n  ‘Grey seems to me a silly fellow, with a greater wish than\r\n  abilities to do mischief. Charles Fox’s speech is more a panegyric\r\n  on the constitution than on his friend’s motion. When every man is\r\n  left to himself to reform an old constitution or make a new one,\r\n  no two will be found of a mind on the subject. Sherry’s speech was\r\n  nothing to the purpose. There was no attempt of the phalanx which\r\n  I so much dreaded, as the doubling our _tiers état_. Thank God,\r\n  their great gun has flashed in the pan! The mountain has laboured\r\n  in vain. You know I hope that the gang in Parliament, like\r\n  Egalité’s creatures in the “Convention,” is called the _Mountain_.\r\n  And it has been called by a punster of the party _Mount Sigh-on_.\r\n  I fear the war will be long and bloody; and how it will end who\r\n  can tell? Nothing but a vigorous prosecution of the war can save\r\n  the whole civilised globe from destruction. After disdaining in\r\n  the House the principles which they had suggested and encouraged\r\n  out of it, I should not wonder if the Scotch and English\r\n  petitioners for reform on the basis of _universal suffrage_ should\r\n  mob and _September_ their friends the demagogues whenever they can\r\n  catch them. I don’t love mischief, but I do cordially wish\r\n  something of that kind were to happen.\r\n\r\n                        ‘Adieu.\r\n                                  ‘Ever yours sincerely,\r\n                                                   ‘CHARLES BURNEY.’\r\n\r\nFrom Dr. Symonds, high encomiums of my ‘Example,’ &c.\r\n\r\n                       ‘Prince of Wales Coffee House: April 8, 1793.\r\n\r\n  ‘Traveller Coxe[156] desired me to tell you how charmed he was\r\n  with your pamphlet; nay, he had begun to write five or six lines\r\n  to you, but thought afterwards it was taking too great a liberty.\r\n  One thing, however, he wishes you to expunge in your next edition,\r\n  viz.: a reflection on Sunday schools as not being founded on\r\n  truth. You must not be surprised at this, for he is a zealous\r\n  patron of them, and has explained the Catechism in print for that\r\n  purpose. Wherever I go I hear your “Example of France” spoken of\r\n  in the highest terms as to the matter.\r\n\r\n  ‘Everyone agrees that no political writer whatever has set the\r\n  representation of property in so clear and just a light. Bishop\r\n  Douglas, who has written many good pamphlets, and is therefore the\r\n  best judge, makes no scruple to declare frequently that you\r\n  deserve from Government a most ample reward; but we both wish, as\r\n  well as others, for your sake, that the second edition may be\r\n  printed more correctly.\r\n\r\n  ‘You should come to town and be presented, or, at least, take an\r\n  opportunity to walk on the Terrace at Windsor, where you would not\r\n  fail of being marked out. Bishop Watson’s appendix has rendered\r\n  him _rectus in curia_. A few days ago he was at Court, talking\r\n  with Lord Dartmouth, who mentioned the word philosophy, which the\r\n  King overhearing, came to the bishop, and said, “I have read the\r\n  best sort of philosophy, my lord, in your sermon and appendix,\r\n  which has wonderfully pleased me.” The bishop, of course, made his\r\n  bow, and then the King went on, “You write so concisely and so\r\n  forcibly, that everyone must be convinced by your arguments;” on\r\n  which the bishop replied, “I like, Sir, to step forward in a\r\n  moment of danger.” The King rejoined, “You have shown a good\r\n  spirit, and it could not be done in a better manner.” Should the\r\n  last volume of \"Clarendon’s Letters\" come in your way, I would\r\n  advise you to read the famous one from Sir John Colepeper to\r\n  Secretary Nicholas; which is always esteemed as a wonderful\r\n  instance of political sagacity, as it foretold that the\r\n  Restoration would be accomplished by Monk! But I think there is\r\n  another part of this letter which shows equal sagacity, viz.: his\r\n  desiring that Charles would not send over any foreign troops into\r\n  England, as this measure would not fail of uniting the English\r\n  against him; whereas, if they were left to themselves, he would\r\n  always have a strong party, and must sooner or later be restored.\r\n  I am fully convinced of the truth of this reasoning; and of what\r\n  use is history unless it be considered as a school for modern\r\n  politicians?\r\n\r\n  ‘Why did you not let me know whether your second edition had gone\r\n  to the press or not? Before I left Cambridge I saw a gentleman who\r\n  told me that Sir William Scott had mentioned in a letter to one of\r\n  his friends there that it was by far the most convincing and best\r\n  pamphlet that had been published.\r\n\r\n  ‘All I could wish is that you had not stigmatised all reformers\r\n  with the name of enemies to the state; or, at least, you intimated\r\n  it.

They do not apprehend much difficulty in carrying it\r\n  through the Houses, though the addition must be supplied out of\r\n  the tithes in the hands of lay proprietors. Hardy is Professor of\r\n  Ecclesiastical History at Edinburgh—a most sensible man, with\r\n  great liberality of mind. Sir Henry is a polished man, and\r\n  likewise a man of business. I hope to see them both at St.\r\n  Edmund’s Hill, and you must meet them. You should get Hardy’s\r\n  pamphlet, the “Patriot,” published in Scotland on the present\r\n  emergency; there are in it many excellent things.\r\n\r\n  ‘You seem in your letter to be still apprehensive of some plots\r\n  and insurrections.\r\n\r\n  ‘Plot!

The book to which\r\n  he alludes cannot be the “Bilancio dello stato,” &c., which was\r\n  written to please Count Firmian. I knew well the gentleman who\r\n  wrote it and gave it to me, as I often met him at dinner at the\r\n  count’s.\r\n\r\n  ‘Sometimes he was too decisive. One day he said at the count’s\r\n  table that the Bresciano contained 800,000 inhabitants now. As\r\n  Count F. knew that I had just come from Brescia, and had not lost\r\n  my time there, he asked me what number there was; on which I told\r\n  him that there were 376,000 according to a census taken a few\r\n  years before. The count smiled, and looked very attentively on\r\n  Carpani (for that was the author’s name), who never liked me so\r\n  well after that day, nor had Count Firmian so high an opinion of\r\n  him. You possibly may not know the history of Sir John Macpherson.\r\n  He offered the Duke of Grafton, when he was at the head of the\r\n  Treasury, a vast collection of jewels, by order of the Nabob of\r\n  Arcot, which the duke absolutely refused, and Bradshaw, his\r\n  secretary, also. Sir John, thinking that the nabob would not\r\n  believe that he had offered the present, published for his own\r\n  vindication the answers of the duke and Bradshaw, for which he was\r\n  turned out of the company’s service, as he was pursuing an\r\n  interest then opposite to its interests.\r\n\r\n  ‘Scotch influence not long after restored him. You will find the\r\n  letters in Lind’s appendix to the defence of Lord Pigot. You are\r\n  now, of course, so much of a politician as not to be surprised\r\n  (shall I say disgusted?) at Macpherson’s conduct. The opinion of\r\n  the King of Prussia as to your book I value not a straw; but that\r\n  of the Marshal de Castries certainly carries with it great weight.\r\n\r\n  ‘He is one of the few who adhered to Necker from gratitude, when\r\n  the latter was turned out of his post about ten years ago; and I\r\n  heard a very good character of the maréchal when I was last in\r\n  France.

By these laws\r\nall the officers of the Board were bound to attend, with no other\r\nexception than the months of August, September and October, with one\r\nmonth at Christmas and three weeks at Easter. These laws, ready cut\r\nand dried when the Board met, were adopted with no other alterations\r\nthan such as the President himself had made in them, previously to\r\ntheir being presented at the meeting. Lord Hawke had examined the\r\nrules and orders of many societies, and found that in all letters\r\ncommunications were addressed to the Secretaries, and answers given\r\nby them. Sir John Sinclair struck this out, and directed all such\r\ncommunications to be to the President (himself), and for him also to\r\nsign all letters. This at once converted the Secretary into nothing\r\nmore than a first clerk. I saw not at first the tendency of the\r\nalterations; but I soon felt their effect. All letters were dictated\r\nby the Secretary and written in a book; this book was altered and\r\ncorrected at the will of the President, and such alterations made as\r\nin respect of agriculture were absurd enough; the whole done in such\r\na manner as not to be very pleasing.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, Sir John Sinclair gave the Board the use of his\r\nhouse, which ensured another circumstance hostile to my feelings.\r\nThere was only one room for transacting the business, by the\r\nSecretary, under-Secretary, two clerks, to which Sir J. after added\r\nthe constant attendance of an attorney, for assisting in the\r\nbusiness of a general Enclosing Act, about which the President\r\nbusied himself some years in vain. As I was determined to pass all\r\nthe vacations at my farm in Suffolk, six journeys of myself and\r\nservants became necessary, and caused a considerable expense. I also\r\nwas compelled to hire lodgings at the expense of two or two guineas\r\nand a half per week, and when I experienced the full career[158] of\r\nall these circumstances, I deliberated repeatedly and carefully with\r\nmyself, whether it would not be cheaper to me to throw up the\r\nemployment. Long after, upon review of the whole, I was amazed that\r\nI had not done it, more especially as my plan for settling on the\r\nmoors in Yorkshire was offered to my choice. I was infinitely\r\ndisgusted with the inconsiderate manner in which Sir John Sinclair\r\nappointed the persons who drew up the original reports, men being\r\nemployed who scarcely knew the right end of a plough; and the\r\nPresident one day desired I would accompany him with one of these\r\nmen, a half-pay officer out of employment, to call on Lord Moira to\r\nrequest his assistance in the Leicestershire Report, when this\r\nperson told his Lordship that he was out of employment and should\r\nlike a summer’s excursion. To do him justice, he did not know\r\nanything of the matter. Still, however, he was appointed, and amused\r\nhimself with his excursion to Leicester. But the most curious\r\ncircumstance of effrontery was, that the greater number of the\r\nreporters were appointed, and actually travelled upon the business\r\nbefore the first meeting of the Board took place, under the most\r\npreposterous of all ideas—that of surveying the whole Kingdom and\r\nprinting the Reports in a single year; by which manœuvre Sir John\r\nthought he should establish a great reputation for himself.\r\nConsequently by his sole authority, who could not possibly know\r\nwhether the members of the Board would approve or not such a plan. I\r\nwas a capital idiot not to absent myself sufficiently to bring the\r\nmatter to a question, and leave them to turn me out if they pleased.\r\nMr. Pitt would probably have interfered and effected the object I\r\nwanted, and, if not, would have provided for me in a better way.\r\nHowever, I made use of the opportunities that offered to frequent\r\nthe company of those that were agreeable to me; for a part of the\r\ntime was pretty regularly passed at the conversaziones of Mrs.\r\nMatthew Montagu and the Countess of Bristol, where I met an\r\nassemblage of persons remarkable for every characteristic of the\r\n_bas-bleu_ mixed with great numbers of the highest rank. [I was]\r\nalso at many similar parties upon a smaller scale at Mr. Charles\r\nColes’, the intimate friend of Soame Jenyns, and to whom he left the\r\nproperty of his works. The _petits soupers_ at Mrs. Matthew\r\nMontagu’s, and to which she asked a selection of eight or nine\r\npersons, were very pleasant, the conversations interesting, and this\r\nselect number more agreeable than I ever found full rooms. On my\r\nfirst coming to town in the spring of 1794, I enquired of several\r\nmembers of the Board whether there was not a farmers’ club in\r\nLondon, and was surprised that there never had been any institution\r\nof the kind. I determined to endeavour at establishing one, and\r\nspoke to the Duke of Bedford and the Earls of Egremont and\r\nWinchilsea, who much approved the idea, and applying also to a few\r\nmore, I directed cards to be sent them from the Thatched House\r\nTavern,[159] in order to establish a club. This meeting was fully\r\nattended, and a book being called for, the club was instituted, and\r\nseveral rules entered, and the meetings appointed once a fortnight\r\nduring the sittings of Parliament. This club became very\r\nfashionable, and applications to be elected were very numerous, from\r\nthe members of both Houses of Parliament; and it subsists to this\r\nday, but has for some time been very ill attended. This was\r\noccasioned by too free an election of all who offered. While the\r\nclub was limited to fifty members it was well attended, but\r\nafterwards such numbers were received, and with so much facility, as\r\ngreatly to injure the establishment. I have one remark to make upon\r\nclubs; the life and soul of them is limitation to a selected few,\r\nand to blackball the great mass of applicants, selecting merely such\r\nas will form a very valuable addition to the society, which probably\r\nmay not amount to more than one in twenty. The annual subscription\r\nwas two guineas: one to the house, one to form a fund at the\r\ndisposition of the club. The latter gradually accumulated till it\r\namounted to 700_l._ or 800_l._ Both Sir John Sinclair and I were\r\nstrenuous that this might be applied to some useful purpose, and\r\nwith difficulty we got an appropriation of fifty guineas as a reward\r\nfor the best plough that could be produced; but the money assigned\r\nto advertisements being much too small, the offer was unknown, and\r\nno plough produced.\r\n\r\nA member once proposed that the 800_l._ might be given to charitable\r\ninstitutions; but this was negatived in an instant, and the sum is\r\nstill left (1812) unemployed in the funds.\r\n\r\nWhile the club flourished the members who most generally attended\r\nwere the Dukes of Bedford, Buccleugh, Montrose, the Earls of\r\nEgremont, Winchester and Darnley, the Lords of Wentworth,\r\nSomerville, de Dunstanville, Sheffield, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nI often dined at Charles Coles’, where I met repeatedly Jacob\r\nBryant,[160] Mrs. Montagu, Mrs. York, Mrs. Garrick, Hannah More,\r\nMrs. Orde and Soame Jenyns. The conversation at these parties on the\r\npublications of the day, anecdotes of the time, with the conduct of\r\nmany of the great men of the age, was usually very interesting.\r\nAlas! alas! how few of these persons are now left. I was very eager\r\nin listening to every word that fell from Hannah More, though not\r\nnearly so much so as I should have been many years after.\r\n\r\nI had an incessant round of dinners and many evening parties, and\r\ngenerally with people of the highest rank and consequence, but I was\r\nnot pleased, being discontented with my employment, and disgusted\r\nwith the frivolous business of the Board, which seemed to me engaged\r\nin nothing that could possibly produce the least credit with the\r\npublic. After five months’ residence at London, I went to the Duke\r\nof Bedford’s at Woburn on my way to Bradfield, spending some days\r\nvery agreeably in company that could not fail of being interesting.\r\n\r\nThis year my second daughter Elizabeth, who, as I have mentioned\r\nbefore, was married to the Rev. John Hoole, died of consumption. She\r\nwas of a most amiable, gentle temper, and in a resigned frame of\r\nmind, which gave me much satisfaction. The last visit I paid her at\r\nAbinger, in Surrey, she was very weak, yet not suspected to be so\r\nnear her end. But at the last parting with me, she did it in so\r\nfeeling and affectionate a manner as seemed to imply that she\r\nthought she should see me no more. It made me, for a time, extremely\r\nmelancholy, which was shaken off with great difficulty. I took a\r\ntour into Hampshire, where I passed several days with Mr. Poulett at\r\nSombourne, taking an account of the agriculture of that district,\r\nthe result of which examination was printed as an appendix to the\r\noriginal Hampshire Report.\r\n\r\nOn the meeting of the Board in 1793, Sir John Sinclair had\r\nparticularly requested me to draw up a Report for the County of\r\nSuffolk, to effect which I took several journeys into different\r\nparts of the county at some expense, and formed the Report which was\r\nprinted in 1794. I never executed any work more commended in Suffolk\r\nthan this. I had no remuneration.\r\n\r\nLetters received this year:—\r\n\r\nFrom Jeremy Bentham, Esq., enquiries into the landed property of\r\nGreat Britain and into the rental and value of houses:—\r\n\r\n                                     ‘Hendon, Middlesex: Sept. 1794.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—Permit my ignorance to draw upon your science on an\r\n  occasion that happens just now to be a very material one to me. I\r\n  have a sort of floating recollection of a calculation, so\r\n  circumstanced, either in point of authority or argument, as to\r\n  carry weight with it, in which the total value of the landed\r\n  property in this country (Scotland, I believe, included) was\r\n  reckoned at a thousand millions, and that of the movable property\r\n  at either a thousand millions or twelve hundred millions. Public\r\n  debt did not come, I think, at least, it ought not to come, into\r\n  the account; it being only so much owned by one part of the\r\n  proprietors of the two thousand or the two thousand two hundred\r\n  millions to another.\r\n\r\n  ‘Upon searching your book on France, which was the source from\r\n  whence I thought I had taken the idea, I can find no calculation\r\n  of the value of the movable property, nor even of the immovable in\r\n  an explicit form; on the contrary, in the instance of the\r\n  immovable, I find suppositions with which any such estimate\r\n  appears to be incompatible. The land tax at four shillings, I\r\n  find, you suppose, were it to be equal all over the country, would\r\n  be equivalent to as much as three shillings, on which supposition\r\n  the rental (the tax of four shillings producing no more than two\r\n  thousand millions) would amount to no more than 13,000,000_l._ nor\r\n  consequently the value, at so many years’ purchase, say\r\n  twenty-eight, to more than three hundred and sixty-four millions;\r\n  or at thirty, to three hundred and ninety millions; to which, in\r\n  order to complete the calculation of the landed property of Great\r\n  Britain, that of Scotland would have to be added.\r\n\r\n  ‘The population of the three kingdoms you reckon in two places at\r\n  eleven millions; but in another place at fifteen. Is the latter a\r\n  slip of the pen? or, in the two former places, was only two\r\n  kingdoms (England and Scotland) in your view, though three are\r\n  mentioned? A circumstance that seems to favour the latter\r\n  supposition is, that the population of Ireland is well known (if I\r\n  do not much misrecollect) from recent and authentic sources to be\r\n  a little more than four millions; and as Scotland turns out to\r\n  contain a million and a half, this would leave nine and a half\r\n  millions for England, which, I should suppose, would quadrate in\r\n  round numbers with Mr. Howlett’s calculations, to which we refer;\r\n  a book which, from forgetfulness, I have never made myself master\r\n  of, and to which, being in the country, I have no speedy means of\r\n  recurring.\r\n\r\n  ‘Now what I wish for is as follows: (1) a calculation (or, I\r\n  should rather say, the result) of the value of the landed property\r\n  of Great Britain reckoned at [so many] years’ purchase, two\r\n  prices—a peace price and a war price—could they be respectively of\r\n  sufficient permanence to be ascertained, would be of use.\r\n\r\n  ‘(2) A calculation of the value of the personal, _i.e._ immovable\r\n  property of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n  ‘(3) The amount of the population of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n  ‘What I am a petitioner for is the benefit of your judgment and\r\n  authority upon the three several subjects; by reference, if there\r\n  be any other person’s calculation that you are satisfied with;\r\n  otherwise from your own notes; and, in either case, a word or two\r\n  just to indicate the sources from which they are taken would be an\r\n  additional help and satisfaction.\r\n\r\n  ‘The occasion of the trouble I am attempting to give you I\r\n  expressly forbear mentioning; not only for want of space and time,\r\n  but more particularly that it may be impossible, and might, upon\r\n  occasion, be known to be impossible, that the response of the\r\n  Oracle should have received any bias from the consideration of the\r\n  purpose for which it was consulted.\r\n\r\n  ‘I am, dear sir, with never failing esteem and regard,\r\n\r\n                                             ‘Yours ever,\r\n                                                   ‘JEREMY BENTHAM.’\r\n\r\n                                            ‘Q.I.P.: Sept. 30, 1794.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—A thousand thanks for your kind letter—sorry you should\r\n  fancy you have been bathing[161] for health—hope it was not\r\n  true—only idleness—we can’t afford to have you otherwise than\r\n  well.\r\n\r\n  ‘Must prefer[162] you once more, “Rental of England twenty-four\r\n  millions.” Good! but houses, such as those in town, and others\r\n  that have a separate rent, are included? I suppose not; since for\r\n  them you would have given a separate and different price in number\r\n  of years’ purchase.\r\n\r\n  ‘In one of your tours you guess this article at five millions. Do\r\n  you abide by that guess? I think the number must have increased\r\n  since then considerably; that was, I believe, about twenty years\r\n  ago. London and the environs must since then have increased, I\r\n  should think, at least a quarter of a million. How many years’\r\n  purchase would you reckon houses at, upon an average, old and\r\n  young together? Shall we say sixteen? I should think, at the\r\n  outside.\r\n\r\n                                ‘I am, dear Sir,\r\n                                            ‘Your much obliged,\r\n                                                    ‘JEREMY BENTHAM.\r\n\r\n  ‘A. Young, Esq.’\r\n\r\nThe two following letters are from Mrs. Hoole, Dr. Burney’s\r\nfavourite, Miss Bessy, to her father:—\r\n\r\n                      _To Arthur Young, Esq._\r\n\r\n                                           ‘Sidmouth: Feb. 22, 1794.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—We came hither from Lynn near three weeks since, as Mr.\r\n  Hoole informed you. We are in very warm and comfortable lodgings,\r\n  and the woman of the house is very attentive and obliging. The air\r\n  of this place is very mild and very moist, but they tell us the\r\n  healthiest of any upon the coast. Mr. Hoole has been on to\r\n  Exmouth, which, upon the whole, he does not like so well. We do\r\n  not find that Devonshire is cheaper the further you go, but the\r\n  contrary, at least on the coast.\r\n\r\n  ‘With regard to myself, I do not find I am any better for this\r\n  journey, indeed I have had more fever and cough since I came here\r\n  than ever I had. I am at present better, but I know that is owing\r\n  to a very strict regimen which I have lately taken to. The weather\r\n  has been very unfavourable, for though it has not been cold we\r\n  have had almost constantly either rain or wind. We have been\r\n  absent from home near nine weeks, and Mr. H. must very soon return\r\n  to his curacy; he will either take me with him or leave me here,\r\n  and we wish very much to know what you advise, considering _all\r\n  circumstances_.\r\n\r\n  ‘This place is certainly warmer than Surrey, but we have heard\r\n  here, as at Lynn, that it sometimes proves unfavourable in\r\n  consumptive cases. I do not think Abinger at all in fault; I have\r\n  been well or _better_ there than anywhere. But I am not unwilling\r\n  to be left here, if it should still be thought advisable. Will you\r\n  have the goodness to write as soon as you can, as we shall not\r\n  determine till we hear? Mr. Hoole has had but one letter from you\r\n  about a month ago. This I mention lest you should have sent any\r\n  which may have miscarried.\r\n\r\n                  ‘Believe me, dear Sir,\r\n                                  ‘Your affectionate Daughter,\r\n                                                   ‘ELIZABETH HOOLE.\r\n\r\n  ‘Perhaps you may like to know something of the price of\r\n  provisions: Meat 4½d. per lb.; poultry is reasonable; chickens\r\n  from 2_s._ to 2_s._ 6_d._ a couple; milk 2_d._ a quart; butter\r\n  10_d._ per lb.’\r\n\r\n                    _Postscript from Mr. Hoole_\r\n\r\n  ‘I fear this journey will be of no avail.

I am now quite free from pain, and can sleep\r\n  on one side as well as the other; I think the last blister was of\r\n  use. I have been twice in the warm bath since Mr. Hoole went. My\r\n  cough must have its course.\r\n\r\n  ‘I had a very kind letter from Agnes yesterday; she offers, if she\r\n  can get permission, to come and stay with me until Mr. Hoole\r\n  returns, and adds, if she cannot, Mrs. Forbes says she is at\r\n  liberty, and would willingly come; but I would not bring them down\r\n  upon any account, as I am more comfortably settled than anybody\r\n  would suppose, and I am sure Mr. Hoole will be back in a short\r\n  time.\r\n\r\n  ‘Sidmouth is certainly very mild; we have had no cold winds, but\r\n  this clear weather suits me better than that warm moist weather we\r\n  had in February. But I cannot walk by the seaside; there is always\r\n  wind, and it seems colder than anywhere else.\r\n\r\n  ‘I would not blame Mrs. F. in the least; I might have been the\r\n  same or worse anywhere; if anything in the air disagreed with me,\r\n  it was the moisture. We have no post from hence, either Monday or\r\n  Tuesday. I wrote to Mr. Hoole last Sunday, or would have answered\r\n  yours sooner. The quickness, or rather rapidity, with which our\r\n  letters arrive from town, seems surprising—a letter put in one\r\n  night we have the next. It is not the custom indeed to deliver\r\n  them at night, as the post comes in so late as nine, but if you\r\n  send they will give you them. At Lynn, which is about the same\r\n  distance from town, they deliver them at six in the evening, but\r\n  we have here a cross-post to send for them nine miles.\r\n\r\n  ‘I beg you will not think me worse than I am, and believe me,\r\n\r\n                            ‘Your affectionate Daughter,\r\n                                                  ‘ELIZABETH HOOLE.’\r\n\r\n                      _From J.

However, I must take notice of\r\n  your way of arguing. You say “the people in France _are_ starved,\r\n  and assignats _are_ destroyed,” with significant dashes. You told\r\n  me just the same in 1793 and 1794, and venture it once more.\r\n  Assuredly you seem to reason like the old wizard Tiresias in\r\n  Horace, “Quicquid dicam aut erit aut non.” Whether your\r\n  predictions be verified or not, you assume, like Tiresias, to\r\n  speak the truth.\r\n\r\n  ‘I always thought with you, that Mr. Pitt would receive no real\r\n  benefit from his new friends; but I have heard the Duke of Grafton\r\n  say that he would not have entered on the war if he had not been\r\n  able to detach some from the Opposition. If this be so, there is\r\n  great reason to lament that he could detach them.\r\n\r\n  ‘We have received here the Bishop of Llandaff’s speech on the Duke\r\n  of Bedford’s motion, published by Debrett. It amazed me to find\r\n  that the Bishop of Durham ventured to speak after him. A gentleman\r\n  who heard them both says that Watson’s was rich, clouted cream,\r\n  and Barrington’s thin, meagre, blue skim milk, frothed up with an\r\n  egg, but with so weak a froth that it rose only to fall instantly.\r\n  We are told that after Æschines was banished, in consequence of\r\n  Demosthenes’ speech _de coronâ_, one of Æschines’ friends carried\r\n  to him in his banishment a copy of Demosthenes’ speech; on which\r\n  the former said, “But what if you had heard it?”\r\n\r\n  ‘Two fellows of this college, who heard Watson, bear the same\r\n  ample testimony to the excellent manner in which he delivered it.\r\n\r\n  ‘You tell me “that our situation is prosperous beyond all\r\n  example;” I should think so too if it were unnecessary to multiply\r\n  loans. The complaints of the dearness of the necessaries of life\r\n  seem to pervade the whole island, and I fear they must still be\r\n  dearer. If we be forced to persist in this war (and how are we to\r\n  get out of it, it is difficult to see) the middle class of the\r\n  people, of which you and I form a part, must be driven down to the\r\n  lower. They hold it is a principle not to tax the lower, but to\r\n  tax luxuries, so that the middle class will be forced to abandon\r\n  everything but necessaries, and then the upper class must pay all.\r\n  This, to use your words, “_must render us prosperous beyond all\r\n  example_.” I rather accede to Charles Coles’ declaration in his\r\n  last letter to me: “Alas! our glory is gone to decay.” A day or\r\n  two ago I was looking into the famous pamphlet of my old friend,\r\n  Israel Mauduit,[163] on the German war, in which I stumbled on the\r\n  following sentence, very applicable to our entering into this\r\n  _just_ war to save the Dutch: “Is Britain to make itself the\r\n  general knight errant of Europe, to rescue oppressed States, and\r\n  exhaust itself in order to save men in spite of themselves, who\r\n  will not do anything towards their own deliverance?” Adieu!\r\n\r\n                                          ‘Yours sincerely,\r\n                                                       ‘J. SYMONDS.’\r\n\r\n1796.—In the spring of this year I waited on Mr. Pitt, by his\r\nappointment, in order to answer some enquiries of his relative to\r\nthe propriety of any regulations by Parliament of the price of\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nI answered all his enquiries, and could not but admire the wonderful\r\nquickness of his apprehension of all those collateral difficulties\r\nwhich I started, and of which he seemed in a moment to comprehend\r\nthe full extent. I found him hostile to the idea.\r\n\r\n_March._—Among various dinners [was] at Mr. Burke’s and at Mrs.\r\nBarrington’s parties. In May dinners at Duke of Bedford’s, Duke of\r\nBuccleugh’s, and Mr. Jenkinson and Lady Louisa’s; her manner is not\r\nthe most agreeable, [but] she has ease and elegance. I have long\r\nknown her at Ickworth.\r\n\r\n_May 1._—For some time past the following advertisement has appeared\r\nin many of the London papers: ‘Speedily will be published a letter\r\nfrom the Bight Hon. Edmund Burke to Arthur Young, Esq., Secretary to\r\nthe Board of Agriculture, on some projects talked of in Parliament,\r\nfor regulating the price of labour.’ The appearance of this\r\nadvertisement induced Sir John Sinclair to write to Mr. Burke to\r\npropose to him that he should undertake to draw up for the Board the\r\nchapter of a general Report which was intended to treat on the\r\nsubject of labour and provisions.\r\n\r\nThe question in the House of Commons was decided before the\r\npublication could appear, and it was supposed that Mr. Burke had, in\r\nconsequence, abandoned the intention of publishing his ideas. But\r\nSir John, not having received any answer, or, at least, any that was\r\nsatisfactory to him, requested me to take his chariot and go to\r\nGregory’s, in order that I might discover whether that celebrated\r\ncharacter continued his intention of throwing his thoughts upon\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nI reached Mr. Burke’s before breakfast, and had every reason to be\r\npleased with my reception.\r\n\r\n‘Why, Mr. Young, it is many years since I saw you, and, to the best\r\nof my recollection, you have not suffered the smallest change; you\r\nlook as young as you did sixteen years ago. You must be very strong;\r\nyou have no belly; your form shows lightness; you have an elastic\r\nmind.’\r\n\r\nI wished to myself that I could have returned anything like the\r\ncompliment, but I was shocked to see him so broken, so low, and with\r\nsuch expressions of melancholy. I almost thought that I was come to\r\nsee the greatest genius of the age in ruin.\r\n\r\nAnd I had every reason to think, from all that passed on this visit,\r\nthat the powers of his mind had suffered considerably.\r\n\r\nHe introduced me to his brother, Mr. W. Burke, to Mrs. B., and to\r\nthe Count de la Tour du Pin, an emigrant philosopher and naturalist.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast he took me a sauntering walk for five hours over his\r\nfarm, and to a cottage where a scrap of land had been stolen from\r\nthe waste. I was glad to find his farm in good order, and doubly so\r\nto hear him remark that it was his only amusement, except the\r\nattention which he paid to a school in the vicinity for sixty\r\nchildren of noble emigrants. His conversation was remarkably\r\ndesultory, a broken mixture of agricultural observations, French\r\nmadness, price of provisions, the death of his son, the absurdity of\r\nregulating labour, the mischief of our Poor-laws, and the difficulty\r\nof cottagers keeping cows. An argumentative discussion of any\r\nopinion seemed to distress him, and I, therefore, avoided it. And\r\nhis discourse was so scattered and interrupted by varying ideas,\r\nthat I could bring away but few of his remarks that were clearly\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\nSpeaking on public affairs he said that he never looked at a\r\nnewspaper; ‘but if anything happens to occur which they think will\r\nplease me, I am told of it.’ I observed there was strength of mind\r\nin this resolution. ‘Oh, no!’ he replied, ‘it is mere weakness of\r\nmind.’ It appeared evident that he would not publish upon the\r\nsubject which brought me to Gregory’s; but he declared himself to be\r\nabsolutely inimical to any regulation whatever by law; that all such\r\ninterference was not only unnecessary but would be mischievous. He\r\nobserved that the supposed scarcity was extremely ill understood,\r\nand that the consumption of the people was a clear proof of it;\r\nthis, in his neighbourhood, was not lessened in the material\r\narticles of bread, meat, and beer, which he learnt by a very careful\r\nexamination of many bakers, butchers, and excisemen; nor had the\r\npoor been distressed further than what resulted immediately from\r\nthat improvidence which was occasioned by the Poor-laws.\r\n\r\nMr. Burke had not read Lord Sheffield’s Memoirs of Gibbon. On my\r\nobserving that Mr. Gibbon declares himself of the same opinion with\r\nhim on the French Revolution, he said that Gibbon was an old friend\r\nof his, and he knew well that before he (Mr. G.) died, that he\r\nheartily repented of the anti-religious part of his work for\r\ncontributing to free mankind from all restraint on their vices and\r\nprofligacy, and thereby aiding so much the spirit which produced the\r\nhorrors that blackened the most detestable of all revolutions.\r\n\r\nUpon my mentioning Monsieur de Mounier and Lally Tollendal, he\r\nexclaimed, ‘_I wish they were both hanged!_’\r\n\r\nHe seemed to bear hard upon the Duke de Liancourt, and to allude\r\nindistinctly to some report of my having opened an hospitable door\r\nto that nobleman, and having received a bad return. I defended the\r\nduke, and had not the conversation been interrupted I should have\r\ndiscovered what he meant by the remark. The same observation has met\r\nmy ear on other occasions, but was never explained.\r\n\r\nMrs. Crewe arrived just before dinner, and though she exerted\r\nherself with that brilliancy of imagination which renders her\r\nconversation so interesting, it was not sufficient to raise the\r\ndrooping spirits of Mr. Burke; it hurt me to see the languid manner\r\nin which he lounged rather than sat at table, his dress entirely\r\nneglected, and his manner quite dejected; yet he tried once or twice\r\nto rally, and once even to pun. Mrs. Crewe, observing that Thelwel\r\nwas to stand for Norwich, said it would be horrid for Mr. Wyndham to\r\nbe turned out by such a man. ‘Aye,’ he replied, ‘that would not\r\n_tell well_.’\r\n\r\nShe laughed at him in the style of condemning a bad pun. Somebody\r\nsaid it was a fair one, he said _it was neither very bad nor good_.\r\n\r\nHe gave more attention to her account of Charles Fox than to any\r\nother part of her conversation. She spoke slightingly of him, and\r\ngave us some account of his life at Mrs. Armstead’s. She says he\r\nlives very little in the world, or in any general society, for years\r\npast; that his pleasure is to be at the head of a little society of\r\nten or twelve toad eaters, and seems to contract his mind to such a\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe conversation would have become more interesting had not Mrs.\r\nCrewe been so full of a plan for Ladies’ Subscriptions for the\r\nEmigrants, and consulting him so much on the means of securing the\r\nmoney from the fangs of the Bishop of St. Pol de Léon, whose part,\r\nhowever, Mr. Burke took steadily. This business was so discussed as\r\nto preclude much other conversation. Mr. Burke has been at Gregory’s\r\ntwenty-nine years; and I was pleased to remark that he lived on the\r\nsame moderate plan of life which I witnessed here five-and-twenty\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n_Mem._ ‘To search for that visit.’[164]\r\n\r\nMy visit on the whole was interesting. I am glad once more to have\r\nseen and conversed with the man who I hold to possess the greatest\r\nand most brilliant parts of any person of the age in which he lived.\r\nWhose conversation has often fascinated me; whose eloquence has\r\ncharmed; whose writings have delighted and instructed the world; and\r\nwhose name will without question descend to the latest posterity.\r\nBut to behold so great a genius so depressed with melancholy,\r\nstooping with infirmity of body, feeling the anguish of a lacerated\r\nmind, and sinking to the grave under accumulated misery; to see all\r\nthis in a character I venerate, and apparently without resource or\r\ncomfort, wounded every feeling of my soul, and I left him the next\r\nday almost as low-spirited as himself.\r\n\r\nIn May the Duke of Buccleugh carried me to see Mr. Secretary\r\nDundas’s farm at Wimbledon, where I was to give my opinion of the\r\nmode of draining it. I found his people throwing money away like\r\nfools. They know nothing of the matter. This duke is another\r\ndetermined farmer, and seems to like conversing on no other subject.\r\n\r\nThis year I undertook a journey through the western counties,\r\nthrough Devon into Cornwall, returning by Somersetshire, and\r\npublished the register of it in the ‘Annals of Agriculture.’ I\r\nhappened to be at Exeter at the time of the quarter sessions, and\r\ndined with thirty magistrates, Mr. Leigh, clerk of the House of\r\nCommons, being chairman. I did not know him personally, and joined\r\nmore warmly in a conversation on the Enclosure Bill,[165] than I\r\nshould have done had I known that I was speaking to a person so much\r\ninterested against it. Mr. Leigh was very decided in his opposition\r\nto the measure, asserting that there was no protection for property\r\nin any other mode of proceeding, which had been so long the\r\nestablished custom. I very eagerly refuted this observation till\r\nsome gentleman present spoke to Mr. Leigh, alluding to his official\r\ncharacter. This was one proof of what I had often heard, that the\r\nofficers of the two Houses of Parliament were of all others the most\r\ndetermined opposers of that measure. The reason is obvious; they\r\nhave very considerable fees on the passing of every private\r\nAct,[166] and the clerks of the House have a further benefit which\r\nmight not be compensated in any equivalent that might be given them;\r\nbecause they solicit many of the bills. Still, as there is so plain\r\na precedent which has existed for many years in the case of the\r\nSpeaker of the House, who has 6,000_l._ per annum instead of all\r\nfees, it seems no difficult matter to give an equal equivalent to\r\nthe clerks for all their profits, including what they might make as\r\nsolicitors.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 158:\r\n\r\n  Career, general course of action or procedure.—_Webster._\r\n\r\nFootnote 159:\r\n\r\n  This appears to have been the place lately known as the Thatched\r\n  House Club, St. James’s Street, Piccadilly.\r\n\r\nFootnote 160:\r\n\r\n  1715-1804.

I brought my dear\r\nangelic child[167] with me, who went to school in January, in good\r\nhealth but never in good spirits, for she abhorred school. Oh! what\r\ninfatuation ever to send her to one. In the country she had health,\r\nspirits, and strength, as if there were not enough with what she\r\nmight have learned at home, instead of going to that region of\r\nconstraint and death, Camden House.\r\n\r\nThe rules for health are detestable, no air but in a measured,\r\nformal walk, and all running and quick motion prohibited.\r\nPreposterous! She slept with a girl who could hear only with one\r\near, and so ever laid on one side; and my dear child could do no\r\notherwise afterwards without pain; because the vile beds are so\r\nsmall that they must both lie the same way. The school discipline of\r\nall sorts, the food, &c. &c., all contributed. She never had a\r\nbellyful at breakfast. Detestable this at the expense of 80_l._ a\r\nyear. Oh! how I regret ever putting her there, or to any other, for\r\nthey are all theatres of knavery, illiberality, and infamy.[168]\r\nUpon her being ill in March I took her to my lodgings in Jermyn\r\nStreet, where Dr. Turton attended her till April 12, when I carried\r\nher to Bradfield. He certainly mistook her case entirely, not\r\nbelieving in a consumption, and by physic brought her so low that\r\nshe declined hourly; he stuffed her with medicine at a time when\r\nsending her at once to Bristol or even to Bradfield she went little\r\nmore than skin and bone, with prescriptions for more physicking\r\nunder a stupid fellow at Bury, who purged her till she was a\r\nspectre. On June 13 she went to Smiths’ (Bradfield neighbours), and\r\nthere complained ‘that such a young girl as I who came for air and\r\nexercise should be _thus crammed with physic_.’ Poor thing! her\r\ninstinct told her it was wrong, but she submitted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BOBBIN’ (MARTHA YOUNG).\r\n  _From a miniature by Plymer._\r\n]\r\n\r\n                    _From Bobbin to her Father_\r\n\r\n  ‘My dear Papa,—I received your letter this morning.

Mrs. Oakes writes\r\n  me from Smith that Dr. T. ordered you physic which you have not\r\n  taken, at the same time that he does not at all like your case.\r\n  Now this is a very serious business for your health, and\r\n  consequently it makes me very uneasy. You are extremely weak by\r\n  your own account, and steel is to strengthen. I gave it with my\r\n  own hand to my father for a year, and with great effect; why you\r\n  should doubt the efficacy of anything prescribed by so great a\r\n  physician is more than I can understand; as to ill tastes, it is\r\n  beneath common sense to listen to anything of the sort.\r\n\r\n  ‘But, my dear Bobbin, you ought to bring some circumstances to\r\n  your recollection; the expense I have been at is more than I can\r\n  afford, and I am now paying your school the same as if present. It\r\n  is surely incumbent on you to consider, that when a father is\r\n  doing everything upon earth for your good, yet you ought from\r\n  feelings of gratitude and generosity to do all you can for\r\n  yourself. I ask nothing but what another would positively insist\r\n  on, and would order violent means of securing obedience; I, on the\r\n  contrary, rely on your own feelings and your good sense, and so\r\n  relying, I do beg that you will take everything ordered without\r\n  murmur or hesitation, for I assure you it is with astonishment I\r\n  hear that you have omitted this some time. Call your understanding\r\n  to your aid, and ask yourself what you can think must be my\r\n  surprise at hearing that while all around you are anxious for your\r\n  health, that you alone will be careless of it. It is a much worse\r\n  thing than ill health, for I had rather hear you were worse in\r\n  body than that you had a malady in your heart or head. Think\r\n  seriously of such conduct, and I am confident it will cease, for I\r\n  know your disposition, and that makes me the more surprised, for\r\n  knowing your good temper so well as I do it is perfectly\r\n  astonishing. I am sure I shall hear, and it will be with great\r\n  pleasure, that you are acting worthy of yourself; and having so\r\n  much patience in your illness, you will show it in this, as in so\r\n  many other things. (The first cheap lobsters I shall send you\r\n  three by mail, the weather being hot.) I think you are not strong\r\n  enough to ride a dicky alone. Surely double-horse would be better,\r\n  but if you have tried you must be able to judge. Pray continue to\r\n  write me constantly, for you must know how anxious I am to hear\r\n  exactly your case.\r\n\r\n  ‘God bless you, my dear girl. I talk of your physician and your\r\n  physic, but God forbid you trusted to either without asking His\r\n  blessing regularly. You tell me that you always say your prayers;\r\n  you cannot deceive God, and I hope you have a reliance on His\r\n  blessing, which you cannot have if you do not ask it, and gain the\r\n  habit of asking it.’\r\n\r\n                    _From Bobbin to her Father_\r\n\r\n  ‘My dear Papa,—I received your letter yesterday. Thank you for\r\n  your advice; I had taken the _steel_ and _draughts_ long before I\r\n  received it, besides which I take some more stuff[171] ... and ask\r\n  him [the doctor] likewise how long the steel, &c., must be taken\r\n  before you feel any effect from it, for one might take physic for\r\n  ever without receiving any benefit. Let not my giving you my\r\n  opinion make you think that I do not take mine regularly; I assure\r\n  you I do. My dear papa, how can you imagine that I should ever\r\n  neglect my prayers? No! believe me, I know my duty too well for\r\n  that. I believe _once_, the last time I was at the cottage, when I\r\n  was too weak to say them out of bed, I then said them when Betty\r\n  brought the asses’ milk. One morning I fell asleep and forgot\r\n  them; I thought of it at night, and told her to remind me of them,\r\n  which she did—this she can tell you. I thank you for some fine cod\r\n  and lobsters, which came very fresh and good.\r\n\r\n  ‘I am much the same as when I wrote last, my cough very\r\n  troublesome still.

I had a very disagreeable journey to town, and did not sleep\r\n  a minute, but, thank God, did not take cold; went to bed next\r\n  night at nine o’clock and recovered the fatigue. The Macklins and\r\n  Kedington were in a good deal of rain. They have been at two\r\n  plays; I go to none. K. lives with us, and I am to charge him what\r\n  he costs.

I order everything\r\n  just as usual before I go to the Board, and though I am to pay no\r\n  more than my common expenses when alone, yet, as I necessarily\r\n  live much better, I think it but fair to be quite economical, and\r\n  we have a great deal of pleasant laugh at my pinching them, and\r\n  not permitting their being extravagant. I allow no scrap of a\r\n  supper which they make a rout about, for they come hungry as\r\n  hounds from the play, and drink porter when they can get it; the\r\n  wine I lock up, and have been twice in bed when they return.

YOUNG.\r\n\r\n  ‘N.B.—Papa, you said you would send me some red wine, as there is\r\n  none drank here; he speaks very much against my drinking so much\r\n  water without red wine in it, because my ankles swell so much.’\r\n\r\nThe following were memoranda noted at the time:—\r\n\r\nThe 11th of June I went to the Duke of Bedford’s sheep-shearing, and\r\ngot back (to London) on the 16th. The next day I had a letter that\r\nterrified me so much that on the 19th I set off for Suffolk, and\r\nwent directly to Troston Hall (the seat of Capel Lofft, Esq.), where\r\nthe dear dear child had been carried some days before for change of\r\nair. Good God! what a situation I found her in, worse than I had\r\nconceived possible in so short a time, so helpless and immovable as\r\nto be carried from a chair to her bed, evidently in one of those\r\ncruel consumptive cases which flatter by some favourable symptoms,\r\nyet with fatal ones that almost deprive hope.\r\n\r\nGood Heaven! what have I to look forward to if I lose my child? For\r\nher own sake I know not what to hope; the world is so full of\r\nwickedness and misery, and she must be so innocent and free from\r\ncrimes, that her lot hereafter, I hope and have confidence in the\r\nmercies of God, will be blessed. Ought I then, but from selfishness,\r\nto wish her here? Yet a fond father’s feelings will be predominant.\r\nOh, save her, save her, is my prayer to God Almighty!\r\n\r\nDr. Wollaston, the eminent physician at Bury, has been consulted; he\r\ngives little hopes, but advises a milk and vegetable diet, and said\r\nthat sea air and a humid mild climate would be good. I next wrote to\r\nDr. Thornton, who recommended an egg and meat diet; and Mr. Martyn,\r\nin a letter, desired me to try the inhaling of ether; in fact, all\r\nhas been done that the urgency of the case required, but, alas! she\r\nis past the assistance of all human power. After remaining a week at\r\nTroston I wrote into Lincolnshire for a house at Boston, with a view\r\nto be near the sea, in case she should be able to support a short\r\nvoyage; and the air of that low place is reckoned preferable to the\r\nkeen air of Bradfield. We travelled with slow and short journeys on\r\nJuly 5 to Bradon—still more exhausted; on the 6th to Wisbeach—no\r\nalteration yet from the change of air; on the 7th only to Long\r\nSutton—worse, greatly fatigued, and a very bad night. Oh! the\r\nlacerated feelings of my wounded heart! To see the child of my\r\ntenderest affection in such a state! growing hourly weaker and more\r\nemaciated, during the last week being even unable to stand. It is\r\nbeyond my power to describe what is struggling within me! My sorrow\r\nhas softened me and wrings my very heart strings! How hard does it\r\nappear submissively to bow to that text—‘He that loveth son or\r\ndaughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.’ I have but one\r\nconsolation, which prevents my utter depression and despair. I trust\r\nin the goodness of her Almighty Creator and in the merits of her\r\nblessed Redeemer, that They will, in the mercy of omnipotence,\r\npardon what slight offences she may have been guilty of, and receive\r\nher into that heavenly mansion which I humbly hope her innocence may\r\nexpect. I pray fervently for Their mercy, and only wish that I was\r\nworthy of being heard. May my future life be such as to make an\r\nhereafter the great view, aim, and end of my remaining life! The 8th\r\nwe reached Spalding, too much fatigued to go on, thinking that an\r\nair so different from what she had left might have given some ease.\r\nVain hope! No effort of the kind appears. The 11th we arrived at\r\nBoston, and she bore the journey well. Alas! it was her final stage\r\nin this world!\r\n\r\nThe next day she was still worse, but even now gave one of those\r\ntraits which displayed her delicacy, for upon finding that her\r\nmother was detaining Dr. Wilson with questions, she reminded her of\r\nit by saying, ‘Mamma, you forget there are other ladies wanting the\r\ndoctor.’ On the 13th the crisis of her sufferings was approaching;\r\nshe whispered to me as I sat by her bedside, ‘I hope you pray for\r\nme.’ At about eleven o’clock she asked her sister Mary to read a\r\nprayer as usual, and attended with apparent fervour, putting her\r\nhands together in the attitude of devotion.\r\n\r\nMy poor dear child breathed her last at twelve minutes past one\r\no’clock on Friday morning, the 14th. I was on my knees at her\r\nbedside in great agony of mind. She looked at me and said, ‘_Pray\r\nfor me_.’ I assured her that I did. She replied, ‘_Do it now,\r\npapa_,’ on which I poured forth aloud ejaculations to the Almighty,\r\nthat He would have compassion and heal the affliction of my child.\r\nShe clasped her hands together in the attitude of praying, and when\r\nI had done said, ‘Amen’—her last words.\r\n\r\nThank God of His infinite mercy she expired without a groan, or her\r\nface being the least agitated; her inspirations were gradually\r\nchanged from being very distressing, till they became lost in\r\ngentleness, and at the last she went off like a bird.\r\n\r\nThus fled one of the sweetest tempers and, for her years, one of the\r\nbest understandings that I ever met with. She was a companion for\r\nmature years, for there was in her none of the childish stuff of\r\nmost girls. And there fled the first hope of my life, the child on\r\nwhom I wished to rest in the affliction of my age, should I reach\r\nsuch a period. But the Almighty’s will be done, and may I turn the\r\nevent to the benefit of my soul, and in such a manner as to trust\r\nthrough the mediation of my Redeemer to become worthy to join her in\r\na better world. Her disposition was most affectionate, gentle, and\r\nhumane; to her inferiors, full of humility, and always ready to\r\nperform acts of beneficence, thus attaching the poor by her charity,\r\nwhilst she was equally courted by those above her for that\r\nfascination of manners possessing the attraction of the loadstone.\r\nHer countenance in health beamed with animation, and her dimpled\r\ncheeks smiled with the beauty of a Hebe. Dear interesting creature!\r\nEndowed, too, with a sensibility that shrunk from the gaze, her\r\nappearance in society produced [_here the sentence breaks off_].\r\n\r\nWhat a scene have I described for a fond father to witness!\r\n\r\nOn the 15th the Rev. S. Partridge and his wife came to give us what\r\ncomfort they could, and took us in a most kind and friendly manner\r\nto their house. I determined that her remains should be carried to\r\nBradfield, having a warm hope of being animated to a more fervent\r\ndevotion by the idea of her ashes being deposited in our own village\r\nchurch. To the departed spirit it is less than nothing—to me it may\r\ndo good, and I have need of working out my salvation with fear and\r\ntrembling. I feel that a wretched and depressed state of mind leads\r\nme to more Christian thoughts and more favourable to religious\r\nimpressions than prosperity, or ease, or happiness, as it is called,\r\nand therefore hope I am justified in doing it; and if my family\r\nthink the same, they also will derive benefit.\r\n\r\nAfter a day passed in deep sorrow, Mr. Partridge read one of his\r\nsermons on the intermediate state of departed souls, and which I\r\nafterwards found was one of Jortin’s.[172] From many passages of\r\nScripture it was made clear that they are conscious, and if good in\r\nthis life, happy.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 17th, I arrived at Bradfield, where every object is\r\nfull of the dear deceased.\r\n\r\nOn going into the library the window looks into the little garden in\r\nwhich I have so many times seen her happy. O gracious and merciful\r\nGod! pardon me for allowing any earthly object thus to engross my\r\nfeelings and overpower my whole soul! But what were they not on\r\nseeing and weeping over the roses, variegated sage, and other plants\r\nshe had set there and cultivated with her dear hands. But every\r\nroom, every spot is full of her, and it sinks my very heart to see\r\nthem. Tuesday evening, the 18th, her remains arrived, and at\r\nmidnight her brother read the service over her in a most impressive\r\nmanner. I buried her in my pew, fixing the coffin so that when I\r\nkneel it will be between her head and her dear heart. This I did as\r\na means of preserving the grief I feel, and hope to feel while\r\nbreath is in my body. It turns all my views to an hereafter, and\r\nfills my mind with earnest wishes, that when the great Author of my\r\nexistence may please to take me I may join my child in a better\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nO merciful Saviour, that took on Thee our nature and feelings, grant\r\nme Thy Holy Spirit to confirm and strengthen these sentiments; to\r\nrepent of all my sins and errors, and enable me for the rest of my\r\ndays to look steadily towards that better world where, I trust, the\r\ninnocence of my child, united with her piety, have given her a\r\nplace. Sure, sure, I shall pray with a more fervent and sincere\r\ndevotion over the remains of her whom I so much wish, when it\r\npleases Heaven, that I may join. This was my motive.\r\n\r\nThe 19th I went into a little chamber which I had neatly fitted up\r\nabout three years ago. My dear child had decorated it with some\r\ndrawings and placed her books on the shelves, and left it in that\r\norder and regularity which followed all her actions. I burst into\r\ntears while viewing it, and felt such a depression at my heart that\r\nI thought I should have sunk on the floor. It shall never be\r\naltered, but everything continued as she left it.\r\n\r\n_20th._—Again looked at her garden, and a new one she had marked out\r\nand planted under a weeping willow. No day arrives but some new\r\nobject is presented to move all the springs of affection and regret;\r\nand what day can pass in which these melancholy feelings will not\r\npredominate? In the meantime I read the Scriptures, and Jortin and\r\nother sermons, with an attention I never paid before; and may God of\r\nHis mercy confirm this disposition, and enable me thus to turn this\r\nheavy misfortune to the benefit of my soul. Dispositions which\r\ncompany, travelling, and other pursuits would have tended to banish,\r\nI wish to cherish; a melancholy has produced in me a more earnest\r\ndesire to be reconciled to God than any other event of my life, and\r\nproves that of all the medicines of the soul, sorrow is perhaps the\r\nmost powerful.\r\n\r\nBusiness, pleasure, and the world, tend only to stifle this\r\nseriousness of thought, and to prevent the mind from looking into\r\nitself and examining the foundation of all its future hopes. For\r\nthese three days I have continued perusing no books but the New\r\nTestament and sermons, of which I have read many.\r\n\r\n_21st._—Hoed part of my dear child’s garden under the window, and\r\ncarried her bonnet and cap to her chamber. They produced many tears,\r\nfor I yet continue weak as a babe. Read the whole Gospel of St.\r\nJohn, two sermons of Tillotson on the state of the blessed, and two\r\nof Dr. Horne’s on the purification of the mind by troubles and the\r\ngovernment of the thoughts. I had before in this week read all the\r\nEpistles, the Hebrews, and the Acts of the Apostles, and also\r\nBryant’s ‘Authenticity of the Scriptures.’ Such studies are my only\r\nconsolation. I give full attention, and hope for the blessing of\r\nGod’s Holy Spirit, that I may not let it be vain, or ever suffer the\r\nworld to wipe out this taste for the things that concern another\r\nworld. I attempt the regulation of my thoughts, and to contemplate\r\nthe goodness and mercy of the Deity; but my misery for the\r\nirreparable loss I have suffered yet weighs me down.\r\n\r\n_22nd._—Hoed the rest of her garden. Symonds and Carter spent the\r\nday at the Hall. I wish they had not come together, I wanted\r\nconversation with them separately on the question I had read a good\r\ndeal of, the sleep of the soul after death till the resurrection.\r\n\r\nSymonds will not admit that we can draw any satisfactory conclusion\r\nfor or against it, but Carter allows Dr. Jortin’s reasoning in his\r\nsermon on that subject. In the evening I read what Dr. H. More[173]\r\nsays upon the subject, who is strenuously against it. A state of\r\ninsensibility is a dreadful idea, and I find consolation in the\r\nconviction that my dear girl is now happy.\r\n\r\n_23rd._—Sunday; passed it, I hope, like a Christian. At church\r\nsitting over the remains of my child! Oh! what a train of feelings\r\nabsorbed my soul. In the evening read St. Luke’s Gospel and took a\r\nmost heart-sinking melancholy walk. I cannot yet bring my mind to\r\nsufficient tranquillity to throw into one little memoir these and\r\nother particulars.\r\n\r\nExamined the willows she planted on the island. Oh! that they were\r\nthriving oaks that promised a longer duration, but they may last as\r\nlong as anybody that will care for the planter. Continue to read\r\nScripture, and some of Secker’s[174] and Ogden’s[175] sermons, and\r\nagain began ‘Bryant on Christianity.’ I pray to God with all the\r\nfervency I feel to give me the grace of His Holy Spirit, that I may\r\nturn this loss to the benefit of my soul. Dr. Jortin, in his\r\nseventeenth sermon, most truly says, ‘It is adversity which seizes\r\nupon the future as prosperity dwells upon the present.’ On the 25th\r\nI read Littleton’s[176] ‘Conversion and Apostleship of St. Paul.’ I\r\nhad brought down from London a new political pamphlet of Howlett’s\r\non a subject that was once interesting, but I can attend to nothing\r\nexcept inquiries which in some degree connect with that habit of\r\nmind which flows from my recent loss.\r\n\r\nMrs. —— called to persuade me into company for regaining\r\ncheerfulness. Alas! it will come, I fear, much too soon, and what is\r\nit good for? Sorrow is the best physician to heal a soul that has\r\nbeen too careless in its duty to God.\r\n\r\nWill the world, and pleasure, and society contribute like grief to\r\nsecure me a probability of joining in another world the spirit of\r\nher I mourn?\r\n\r\n_26th._—I read part of Dr. Clarke’s[177] ‘Demonstration of the Being\r\nand Attributes of God,’ as much as I could understand without too\r\nintense an application, and then part of ‘Butler’s Analogy.’ Prayed\r\nto the Almighty in the middle of the day. The morning is the proper\r\ntime, but when we are tired and sleepy, the evening I think an\r\nimproper period to offer either thanksgiving or petitions to the\r\nDivine goodness.\r\n\r\nWhy, oh! why must we have misfortune and sorrow to make us sensible\r\nof our duty to our heavenly Father and our Saviour and Redeemer? How\r\ndifficult to instil a right attention into young people.\r\n\r\nI am, however, thankful that my dear child was naturally serious\r\nand, I believe, well disposed in this respect; with what joy I now\r\nread the following passage in a letter I received from her while she\r\nwas ill at Bradfield before I came down: ‘My dear papa, how can you\r\nimagine that I should ever neglect my prayers? No! believe me, I\r\nknow my duty too well for that.’\r\n\r\nWhat now would be the idea of any improvement or accomplishment\r\ncompared with the least trait like this?\r\n\r\n_27th._—Called for a few minutes on some neighbours. They all want\r\nme to dine with them, but such society to a mind diseased yields no\r\nfood for reflection, and is, therefore, not fit for me. I could\r\nassociate with nobody with comfort, but those whose religious\r\nacquirements could tend to strengthen my present habits.\r\n\r\nI continue to read Butler, also two sermons by Conybeare[178] on\r\nangels; looked at the miniature which my wife has of the dear girl,\r\na most striking likeness by Plymer;[179] wept over it with feelings\r\neasier imagined than described. I will have a copy of it; ’twill\r\nserve, at least, as a melancholy remembrance, and, I hope, recall my\r\nmind should it ever wander from the lamented original.\r\n\r\n_28th._—Finished Butler’s ‘Analogy.’ It does not quite answer the\r\nidea I had formed of him, though a powerful work; but he demands a\r\nsecond perusal, but does not even then promise to be perfectly\r\nclear. Read also Mr. Locke’s ‘Reasonableness of Christianity,’ which\r\nis a luminous convincing work, and must have done great good.\r\nWatered dear Bobbin’s garden and read over her letters. She had, for\r\nher early years, a most uncommon understanding and a penetration\r\ninto character wonderful for the age of fourteen. On reviewing her\r\nlast illness I am filled with nothing but the most poignant regret\r\nand self-condemnation for putting so much reliance in the medical\r\ntribe, for she had the personal attendance or correspondence of five\r\nphysicians and none agreed. I did for the best and spared nothing,\r\nbut had she been a pauper in a village she would, I verily think,\r\nhave been alive and hearty. Such are the blessings of money; it has\r\ncost me 100_l._ to destroy my child, for I do not think one shilling\r\nwas bestowed which did not in one way or other do mischief.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was in much anxiety about my child’s health I bought Mr.\r\nWilberforce on Christianity.[180] I read it coldly at first, but\r\nadvanced with more attention. It brought me to a better sense of my\r\ndangerous state; but I was much involved in hesitation and doubt,\r\nand was very far from understanding the doctrinal part of the book.\r\nThis was well, for it induced me to read it again and again, and it\r\nmade so much impression upon me that I scarcely knew how to lay it\r\naside. It excited a very insufficient degree of repentance, and a\r\nstill more insufficient view of my interest in the Great Physician\r\nof souls.\r\n\r\nIt is rather singular that a trifling circumstance at this time\r\nfirst brought me acquainted with Mr. Wilberforce, whose book I had\r\nbeen again perusing for the fourth time with increased pleasure, and\r\nto whom I had more than once thought of writing for his opinion on\r\nthe intermediate state and original sin. On arriving at Boston, what\r\nwas my surprise on receiving a letter from him relative to\r\nParkinson’s subscription to some book on agriculture, and\r\napologising for the application to a stranger. I seized the pen with\r\neagerness to reply, writing largely about his own book, praising it\r\ngreatly, and telling him of my wish to apply to him. Should this (I\r\nthought) be productive of a connection that might confirm my pious\r\nresolution, I might, perhaps, be justified in attributing it to the\r\ninterposition of God.\r\n\r\nI hope that the thought is not presumptuous. Is it the spirit of my\r\nsweet girl that is thus friendly to me? How pleasing an idea!\r\n\r\n_July 29._—Having excused myself from dining out with the Balgraves,\r\na note from her this morning. But it will not do. Company and the\r\nworld will only draw off my mind from those religious contemplations\r\nand that course of reading which is favourable to prayer,\r\nrepentance, and reformation. I wish not to lessen my grief or banish\r\nmy feelings of that sorrow which turns my heart at present to seek\r\nGod. I dread it will come but too soon; and were it not for this\r\napprehension I should go on my journey to Lincolnshire for the Board\r\ndirectly, but I wish to confirm these feelings and earnestly pray\r\nfor the Divine grace to preserve them to the extirpation from my\r\nheart of love for the world or any of its follies.\r\n\r\n[_Note added by A. Y. in 1817._]\r\n\r\nThroughout many of the succeeding notes, several expressions occur\r\nnot all consistent with true evangelical religion; but I would not\r\nafterwards alter them, because I wished to ascertain, on the\r\nre-perusal of these papers, what was at the moment of my affliction\r\nthe state of my mind and of my faith; and when I consider what were\r\nthe books which I read and admired, I cannot be surprised at any\r\nsuch remarks falling from my pen.\r\n\r\nI have often reflected on the great mercy and goodness of God in not\r\npermitting my religious opinions to be permanently injured by some\r\nof the works which it will be found I so eagerly perused at a period\r\nwhen I could not have one moment’s conversation with any truly pious\r\ncharacter. Two circumstances probably contributed to this effect:\r\nfirst, the incessant attention which I gave to reading the New\r\nTestament; and secondly, my ardent study of Mr. Wilberforce’s\r\n‘Practical Christianity,’ though without thoroughly understanding\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe solitary life I condemned myself to, or, to speak with more\r\npropriety, which alone I relished, while reading sixteen or\r\nseventeen hours a day, and in which I consequently rather devoured\r\nbooks than read them, was, I think, very advantageous, and possibly\r\nmore so in the final result than if my authors had been more truly\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nI have since perused many works which, had they fallen into my hands\r\nat that time, would probably have made me quit my retirement and\r\nrush into the society of men who would have conducted me, in my then\r\nstate of mind, to the utmost lengths of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe writers I consulted were well calculated to lay a certain\r\nsolidity of foundation in the great leading truths of Christianity,\r\nwhich formed a basis whereon it was easy afterwards to raise a more\r\nevangelical edifice.\r\n\r\nIn all this business I cannot but admire the goodness of the\r\nAlmighty in protecting me from many evils to which I might easily\r\nhave been led by my troubled feelings.\r\n\r\n[_Diary continued._]\r\n\r\nRead Dr. Isaac Barrow’s sermon on submission to the Divine will. He\r\nseems a powerful writer, but his language is debased by expressions\r\nvoid of all dignity. Read a good deal in Barrow on the pre-existence\r\nof human souls. Very singular; the texts on which he builds support\r\nhim very faintly, yet there is a degree of probability in the system\r\nconsonant to reason.\r\n\r\n_30th._—Prayed to God over the remains of my dear child, and the\r\ncircumstance fills my mind with that melancholy that is not\r\nunsuitable to religious feelings. I do not wonder at the custom of\r\nthe primitive Christians praying at the tombs of the departed, it is\r\nan obvious and natural prejudice.\r\n\r\nFinished Barrow, and wrote to my friend Mr. Cole to desire he would\r\napply to his neighbour, the learned Bryant, to know his opinion of\r\nthat question. Began Dr. More on the ‘Immortality of the Soul.’\r\nCapel Lofft spent the day with us; his conversation is ready on any\r\nsubject, and mine led to serious ones, which he seems to like. We\r\nhad much that was metaphysical on the soul (pre-existence), a future\r\nstate, &c. He is of opinion that heaven is not so very different\r\nfrom our ideas of what this world might be, as are commonly\r\nentertained; and rightly observes, that if death, evil, anxiety, and\r\ndisease, with corporeal passions, were banished, this earth would be\r\na heaven; and that the knowledge of one another hereafter is not at\r\nall inconsistent with our Saviour’s expression, ‘_in My Father’s\r\nhouse are many mansions_.’\r\n\r\n_31st._—Read Littleton’s sermon on the necessity of well husbanding\r\nour time. It is excellent, he has thoughts and modes of expanding\r\nhis observations that are beyond the common run. Laid aside Dr. More\r\non the ‘Immortality of the Soul;’ he gets so high in the region of\r\nfancy, and is so full of jargon and supposition, under the formula\r\nof demonstrations, that I am disgusted with his farrago; and [there\r\nis] so much on witches, apparitions, &c., as to be mere rubbish.\r\n\r\nRead Sherlock’s sixth sermon on the ‘Immortality of the Soul,’ which\r\nis an admirable one. I see plainly from what I feel upon occasion of\r\nthe severe, dreadfully severe misfortune that I have met with, that\r\nunder great afflictions there can be no real consolation but in\r\nreligion. I have mused and meditated much on what philosophy, as it\r\nis called, could afford in such an exigency, but the amount would be\r\nno more than the employment of the mind, and preventing its dwelling\r\nwithout interruption on the loss sustained, the comfort to be drawn\r\nfrom it would be weak and vain; but the Gospel offers considerations\r\nwhich bear immediately on the source of the evil; affords matter of\r\nconsolation in the certainty of another life, and in those promises\r\nwhich meet the yearnings of the distempered soul; diffuses a calm\r\nand quiet resignation to the Divine will, under the pleasing hope of\r\nseeing those again in the next world whom we have loved tenderly in\r\nthis. To me it seems that when this wish is founded on a virtuous\r\nobject here as that of a parent and a child, the very hope is an\r\nargument in its favour, because it is perfectly consistent with\r\ninfinite benevolence to grant it—and the desire must be universal in\r\nevery human mind.\r\n\r\n_August 1._—Read about half of Sherlock on ‘Immortality,’ but my\r\npatience was then quite exhausted; the verbiage is such that it\r\nsickens one, though I approve the doctrine entirely and agree\r\nwith him in everything. What a loss! that excellent books for\r\nmatter should be so written, or rather spun into such endless\r\ncircumlocutions that time is wasted for want of compression.\r\nRead three or four sermons of Littleton—clear, lucid, and\r\nimpressive.\r\n\r\nAt night a Dane came, recommended by Sir J. Sinclair. Unfortunate to\r\nall my feelings. I refuse dining with all my friends, and to be\r\ntormented with a trifler who can speak neither French nor English.\r\n\r\nMy mind is in a state that cannot bear interruption. I love to mope\r\nalone, and reflect on my misery.\r\n\r\n_August 2._—Began Scott’s[181] ‘Christian Life,’ but Smythies having\r\nsent me the sixth volume of Bishop Newton’s[182] works, containing a\r\ndissertation on the ‘Intermediate State,’ I read it with equal\r\neagerness and satisfaction. It exceeds on that subject all I have\r\nyet met with. He is of opinion, in which all agree, that good\r\nspirits will know each other; and probably, from the parable of\r\nLazarus, have some knowledge of what passes on earth. But that is of\r\nlittle consequence in comparison with the most consoling and\r\ncomfortable idea contained in the first opinion. And what a call is\r\nit to strive with earnestness and ardour to arrive at a situation\r\nthat will recompense us in so great a degree for every evil and\r\nsorrow we can meet with in this world. Can I then hope, by\r\ndedicating the rest of my life here to God, to join my dear child\r\nhereafter, my mother, my other daughter, and my sister; and should\r\nit so please the Almighty in His mercy, my father and brother? Of\r\nthe females I can have little doubt, or rather none. I know too\r\nlittle of the lives of the others to venture to pronounce. Read also\r\nBishop Newton’s dissertation on the Resurrection, general judgment,\r\nand final state of man. They are all excellent, and I rather\r\ndevoured than read them. These books I must buy to read again with\r\nmore attention.\r\n\r\n_3rd._—The Dane is gone, and therefore I am left to my favourite\r\ncontemplations. Newton’s dissertations are consoling, for they leave\r\nme no doubts about that hideous doctrine, the sleep of the soul,\r\nwhich, however it might have been suited for the dead, is dreadful\r\nto those they leave behind. For the rest of my life to know that my\r\ndear child is in a state of conscious existence, and consequently\r\nhappy, is the first of comforts; but to feel the enlivening warmth\r\nand light of the sun, thinking that she felt nothing, but slept in\r\nthe cold grave, would have almost sunk me into it. No! she lives,\r\nand as there is reason to believe, the departed spirits have some\r\nknowledge of what passes here. What a call is it to conduct myself\r\nso as to give no pain to her! Let me imagine myself for ever seen by\r\nthe spirits of my mother and my child. Let me have a keen feeling of\r\nthe pain any unworthy action or impure thought would give to them,\r\nand of the pleasure they would reap from seeing the reverse; that I\r\nwas so living as gave them a hope of my joining them hereafter. Let\r\nme, if possible, entertain this persuasion till I am convinced of\r\nit. I cannot have the thought without being the better man. Oh!\r\nguard me against relapsing into evil negligence, the two certain\r\nfruits of pleasure and prosperity.\r\n\r\nWhat are the friendships of the world! What consolation, what\r\ncomfort!\r\n\r\nWhen most wanted it is sure to fail. One has business, another\r\npleasure; one, a family, another a husband, all have something to\r\nrender them broken reeds to such as are in want; and whether the\r\nboon be comfort or money, they prove the same to the touchstone. Who\r\nhave been my friends? Symonds and Carter are good men, but I have\r\nseen them [of late] only once. Who must I name but Ogden, Sherlock,\r\nJortin, Bishop Newton, Butler, Locke, and Clarke? These have told me\r\nhow to make a friend not like to fail in the time of need, my God\r\nand my Saviour. May I strengthen and confirm that friendship and\r\nturn it to be a habit of my life! And thou, most gentle spirit of my\r\ndeparted child, if it is allowed thee to look down on earth, be my\r\nguardian angel and lead me to everlasting life, to join thee to part\r\nno more!\r\n\r\n_4th._—Read three of Bishop Sherlock’s sermons and one of Dr.\r\nClarke’s, also some passages in his ‘Demonstration of the Truth of\r\nRevealed Religion.’\r\n\r\n_5th._—Read a very good sermon of Bishop Sherlock on Redemption, the\r\nthird in fourth volume. Bishop Butler on human ignorance, excellent.\r\nThis subject, in the books I have yet read, has not been\r\nsufficiently treated, it might be made to refute all the infidels,\r\nand draw mankind to a more religious life.\r\n\r\nMy dear girl’s books are come, her unfinished work, her letters, &c.\r\nMelancholy employment to unpack and arrange them in her room. If any\r\ndifference I think of her with more, rather than with less regret;\r\nyet I hope and trust, not without resignation to the Almighty will\r\nof the great and good Being whose providence has deprived me of her.\r\nI think I feel that this deep regret, this calm sorrow will last my\r\nlife, and that no events can happen that will ever banish her from\r\nmy mind. Ranby called and I conversed with him about her till tears\r\nwould, had I continued it, stopped my speaking. I hate and pity\r\nthose who avoid talking to the afflicted upon the subject which\r\ncauses their affliction, it argues a little trifling mind in one\r\nparty or the other.\r\n\r\nRead Bishop Sherlock’s ‘Dissertation respecting the Sense of the\r\nAncients on the Fall of Man,’ which seems to me (who am, however, no\r\njudge) a very clear and satisfactory work. He appears to have a\r\nsingular talent in reconciling seeming difficulties in knotty texts\r\nof Scripture, and opens every subject with great clearness and an\r\nacute spirit of discrimination.\r\n\r\nI suppose there must be some commonplace book of divinity, but I\r\nknow not whose; a collection of luminous passages from such an\r\nimmensity of writings as there are on this most important of all\r\nsubjects would be very useful; yet every man should make his own,\r\nselecting such topics and observations as come home to his own case\r\nand bosom.\r\n\r\nWere I not going now a most uninteresting journey, I would do this\r\nfor myself. This tour hangs on my mind; nothing would suit my\r\nfeelings so well as to stay here in my present melancholy gloom,\r\nreading divinity, and endeavouring so steadily to fix my mind on\r\neternity and the hope of joining my dear child, as to work a change\r\nin my habits, my life, my conversation, and pursuits; and to do all\r\nthat human frailty will permit to reconcile myself to the Almighty.\r\nThese thoughts, however, I shall try to preserve in spite of a\r\njourney. I will take the New Testament and Wilberforce with me, and\r\nread a portion every day, and spend the Sundays in a manner I have\r\nnever done yet in travelling.\r\n\r\n_August 7._—To Ely. Called for a moment on Carter, who thinks so\r\nhighly of Bishop Newton that he intends to buy his works.\r\n\r\nAt Ely quite alone, and no resource but in my own melancholy ideas.\r\nMy first thought was to send to a Mr. Hall, who has hired\r\nTattersall’s farm, or Mr. Metcalfe, a minor canon, who has written\r\nin the ‘Annals of Agriculture’—but I rejected the scheme and kept to\r\nsolitude. As soon as I finished dinner I began Mr. Wilberforce for\r\nthe fourth time, reading with renewed attention. I hear many\r\nobjections to him, of his being a Presbyterian engrafted on a\r\nMethodist, but it is arrant nonsense. My mind goes with him in every\r\nword. View the Minster and Trinity chapel, and venerate the piety of\r\nformer ages that raised such noble edifices in honour of God the\r\nAlmighty giver and governor of all things. I once thought such\r\nbuildings the efforts of superstition, perhaps folly! How different\r\nare my present sentiments! for what can be more rational than to\r\nraise temples of a character that shall impress some idea, however\r\nweak, of the sublimity of that infinite Being who made and pervades\r\nall that exists, except His own great creative self!\r\n\r\n_8th._—Rise at five, write to my friends Dr. Valpy and C. Cole. To\r\nPeterborough. Much time for reflection, and it is singular that even\r\nwhile I am depressed with deep melancholy at the loss I have\r\nsustained, yet unholy ideas and imaginations will intrude. Is this\r\nthe devil and his powers of darkness which buffet and beset us? Is\r\nnot depravity and sin so inherent in our natures that we are ever\r\nliable to these wanderings which so disgrace our nature at better\r\nmoments? But the conclusion, whatever it be owing to, is clear, that\r\nthe government of the thoughts is an essential part of our duty, as\r\nJohnson has well explained in an admirable ‘Rambler.’ Such thoughts,\r\nunresisted, seize and take possession of the mind, and they cannot\r\ndo that without leading to action and all the guilt that may follow.\r\nRepel the first germinating principle of the idea, and the\r\ndifficulty is not great; but indulge the pleasing dream and the\r\nheart is vitiated, for the imagination is impure.\r\n\r\n[_The remainder of the diary, in the same strain, is much too long\r\nfor insertion. Here are a few closing sentences._]\r\n\r\n_September 2_ [in Yorkshire].—To what is it that I shall return? My\r\nchild no more! To what at London? Solitary in my lodgings, where am\r\nI to send for her whose cheerfulness gilded every scene, and little\r\npleasing ways lent such a charm to render her presence such a\r\ncomfort to me? All gone—gone for ever! Of that description of\r\nfeelings what remains? A blank!—a desert!... Cried over the hair of\r\nmy sweet departed Bobbin! Never more in this world to see thee\r\nagain!\r\n\r\n_October 15._—I have torn my heart to pieces with looking at my dear\r\nchild’s hair! Melancholy remains, but how precious when their owner\r\nis no more! I am to see her no more in this world. Gone for ever!\r\n\r\n_London, November 13._—This day se’nnight I came to town with Mrs.\r\nY. and Mary. I knew it would be a very uncomfortable plan; but to do\r\nas I would be done by made it proper.\r\n\r\n_November 26._—I have been a week at Petworth, an interesting,\r\nsplendid, gay and cheerful week, and, as too often the case, a vain,\r\nfrivolous, and impious one. Sir John Sinclair would have me on the\r\nSunday go to Goodwood. Never a serious word, never a soul to church\r\nfrom that house to thank God for the numerous blessings showered\r\ndown upon it, and the means of good which 60,000_l._ a year confers.\r\nYet Lord Egremont does all that could be wished as far as humanity,\r\ncharity, and doing moral benefits can—but no religion. In the\r\nchapel, no worship, no hats off but my own—dreadful example to a\r\ngreat family and to his children and to 2,500 people in the town. I\r\ntalked to Arthur, and strongly recommended to him to attend\r\nconstantly and to keep himself clear from such a want of piety. He\r\ndisapproves of it much; and I pray to God that yet he may not be\r\ncorrupted by such evil examples, but imbibe a dislike to such want\r\nof gratitude. I watched for opportunities of serious remark, but\r\nnone of effect offered except one observation on Lady Webster’s\r\ninfidelity in religion, when I threw in a word or two. The very\r\nvirtues of such people do mischief by recommending their irreligious\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letters are selected from those received this year:—\r\n\r\n                         _From Dr. Burney_\r\n\r\n                                   ‘Chelsea College: March 16, 1797.\r\n\r\n  ‘My dear Sir,—You have applied to a very incompetent person for\r\n  political consolation in addressing me, an old notorious alarmist\r\n  who has long seen evils approaching even worse than those which\r\n  have already arrived. I wish anything had happened to convince me\r\n  that my mental eyes had been as short-sighted as those in my head.\r\n  But, alas! things are going on everywhere from bad to worse. My\r\n  foolish countrymen, nay, worse, the wicked and incurable democrats\r\n  who inhabit the same island, so far from being cured by the savage\r\n  cruelties and universal misery brought about in France by the\r\n  Revolution and the treatment of other countries which she has\r\n  conquered and even fraternised with, still long for a revolution\r\n  here, without even wishing to avert any of the evils which have\r\n  happened elsewhere, from the diabolical character and principles\r\n  of her inhabitants! I have seen that a wish to break the Bank has\r\n  long been formed, and I even have been advised to get all the cash\r\n  I could for my notes if I had any; and the person who advised this\r\n  measure, who had never been at the Bank before in his life, and\r\n  was forced to inquire his way thither, had been bullying the\r\n  harassed clerks to give him cash for a forty-pound note, for no\r\n  other purpose than to lock it up. Seven millions of guineas were\r\n  issued for notes in one week! Of this sum 300,000_l._, it is said,\r\n  were for notes presented by the English Santerre. A banker from\r\n  Norwich had collected notes to the amount of 400,000_l._, with\r\n  which he came post to London in the same seraphic hope of breaking\r\n  the Bank; but unluckily for his benevolent plan, the further\r\n  issuing of cash had been stopped the night before his arrival. The\r\n  favourite Jacobin plan at present is to make this nation and all\r\n  Europe believe that we are really in a state of bankruptcy, and\r\n  that the notes now in circulation will be soon of as little value\r\n  as French assignats, reporting every day that they are at a very\r\n  considerable discount, which God forbid should ever happen. For my\r\n  own part, I would starve myself to death sooner than buy, even\r\n  food, by the parting with a bank note for a farthing less value\r\n  than it has hitherto had. But the poor Duke of Bedford, Mr. Cooke,\r\n  the dissenting manufacturers, &c., are so distressed for want of\r\n  cash to pay their workmen, that they are _obliged_ to dismiss\r\n  them. And this, to be sure, is not done with an intention of\r\n  throwing all the blame upon Government and making furious rebels\r\n  of all the persons discharged. Everything is seen and represented\r\n  in the blackest colours—the French always right and the\r\n  Administration wrong. For if opposition should ever be obliged to\r\n  allow the present ministry to be right, why change it? And down\r\n  they must pull every person and thing above them, even if, like\r\n  Samson, they are crushed in the ruins, which I have not the least\r\n  doubt will be the case if ever the revolution they seem so\r\n  determined to bring about should happen.\r\n\r\n  ‘The ballot has fallen upon me to furnish a man and a horse to the\r\n  Provisional Cavalry,[183] which has occasioned me much trouble and\r\n  vexation. The expense, had it been double, I would have paid with\r\n  alacrity, for the defence of everything dear to honest men, during\r\n  such a war and with such enemies; but the business of recruiting,\r\n  clothing, accoutring, &c., is so new to men of peace, that they\r\n  know not how to go to work. Three substitutes that I had engaged\r\n  have disappointed me, and the horse I have purchased I am not sure\r\n  will pass muster. Had Government levied a tax of five or ten\r\n  guineas upon each horse that was kept for pleasure, either in or\r\n  out of harness, and done the business of raising a certain number\r\n  of cavalry themselves, it would have been better done, and ladies\r\n  and superannuated gentlemen (like my worship) would have escaped\r\n  infinite plague and vexation.\r\n\r\n  ‘I am exceedingly sorry that your dear and charming little\r\n  daughter is not well.\r\n\r\n                   ‘I am, with sincere regard,\r\n                                    ‘My dear Sir,\r\n                                          ‘Your affectionate Friend,\r\n                                                 ‘CHARLES BURNEY.’\r\n\r\nFrom Edmund Burke, Esq., alluding to the projects in Parliament\r\nbefore named for regulating the price of labour.\r\n\r\n                                                ‘Bath: May 23, 1797.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—I am on the point of leaving Bath, having no further\r\n  hope of benefit from these waters; and as soon as I get home (if I\r\n  should live to get home) should I find the papers transmitted me\r\n  by your Board I shall send them faithfully to you; though, to say\r\n  the truth, I do not think them of very great importance.\r\n\r\n  ‘My constant opinion was, and is, that all matters relative to\r\n  labour ought to be left to the conversations of the parties. That\r\n  the great danger is in Government intermeddling too much. What I\r\n  should have taken the liberty of addressing to you, had I\r\n  possessed strength to go through it, would be to illustrate or\r\n  enforce that principle.\r\n\r\n  ‘I am extremely sorry that any one in the House of Commons should\r\n  be found so ignorant and unadvised as to wish to revive the\r\n  senseless, barbarous, and, in fact, wicked regulations made\r\n  against free trade in matters of provision which the good sense of\r\n  late Parliaments had removed. I am the more concerned at the\r\n  measure, as I was myself the person who moved the repeal of the\r\n  absurd code of statutes against the most useful of all trades,\r\n  under the invidious names of forestalling and regrating. But,\r\n  however, I console myself on this point by considering that it is\r\n  not the only breach by which barbarism is entering upon us. It is,\r\n  indeed, but a poor consolation, and one taken merely from the\r\n  balance of misfortunes.\r\n\r\n  ‘You have titles enough of your own to pass your name to\r\n  posterity, and I am pleased that you have got spirit enough to\r\n  hope that there will be such a thing as a civilised posterity to\r\n  attend to things of this kind.\r\n\r\n                      ‘I have the honour to be,\r\n                           ‘With very high respect and esteem,\r\n                                ‘Your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n                                                    ‘EDMUND BURKE.’\r\n\r\nMr. Burke died July 7 [_note by A. Y._].\r\n\r\nFrom John Symonds, Esq., on public affairs, very gloomy, with much\r\ncondemnation of Mr. Pitt.\r\n\r\n                                   ‘St. Edmund’s Hill: June 8, 1797.\r\n\r\n  ‘At the time, my dear sir, that I received your letter I was\r\n  travelling over Italy, in order to figure in your “Annals of\r\n  Agriculture;” but the state of that country has been so much\r\n  _bouleversé_, that my head has been turned in reflecting upon it,\r\n  as is most probably the case with the greater part of its\r\n  inhabitants.\r\n\r\n  ‘You ask me what plan I could propose to save the country. Arm,\r\n  undoubtedly, as you say; but how to do it most effectually I\r\n  pretend not to determine. You justly reprobate volunteering\r\n  infantry.\r\n\r\n  ‘Charles Cole tells me you have something in the press upon this\r\n  subject. To fill the army or navy with defenders or volunteers, is\r\n  the way to pave the way to our ruin. But I should begin with\r\n  proposing a scheme which would probably be heard with disdain, and\r\n  which has been rejected by the King: recall Lord Camden; appoint\r\n  Lord Moira, Lord Lieutenant, with full powers to emancipate the\r\n  Roman Catholics. He is much respected in Ireland as well as in\r\n  England, for the opinion formed of him from his civil and military\r\n  knowledge and moral character. I have heard Lord Bishop Douglas,\r\n  who is no mean estimator of mankind, often say, that he wished he\r\n  could see Lord Moira one of the Secretaries of State.\r\n\r\n  ‘Were the Catholics satisfied, Ireland might bid defiance to the\r\n  French, and, perhaps, some regular infantry might thence be sent\r\n  to England, which, the Duke of Grafton said lately in the House of\r\n  Lords, was much wanted here. But it is in vain to speak or write\r\n  about Ireland.\r\n\r\n  We govern there by a faction—the Beresfords, Fitzgibbons, and\r\n  Fosters—whose emoluments, including their relations and\r\n  dependents, fall not short of 100,000_l._ per annum; some think\r\n  much more. Now the Polignacs under the old government had not more\r\n  than 50,000_l._ per annum, including a bishopric. This the Duchess\r\n  of Liancourt one day made out to me upon paper, yet she was\r\n  willing enough to exaggerate the profits of that family;\r\n  especially as the old duchess just before had been cast in a\r\n  lawsuit with one of them.\r\n\r\n  ‘Your idea of applying to Bonaparte pleases me much. He would\r\n  probably do more towards effecting a peace than a hundred\r\n  Malmesburys and St. Helens. It will be curious to see what terms\r\n  Pitt will propose. There seems to be no doubt but that the French\r\n  will insist on having all the places taken from them; and probably\r\n  a restitution of twelve or fourteen ships of the line, and perhaps\r\n  a sum of money by way of _indemnification_, for this word was\r\n  always in the mouth of our Premier. After this, an ample\r\n  recompense to the Dutch and Spaniards, whose interests the French\r\n  will consider as their own. A fine peace indeed, after so many\r\n  absurd and haughty declarations of our ministry! A peace there\r\n  must be or an insurrection, if considerable taxes be proposed to\r\n  continue the war. Not that these would be of any avail; for were\r\n  the French merely to line their coasts from Ostend to Calais with\r\n  troops, and do nothing else, their point would be carried. At the\r\n  very time that a separate peace was made by the Emperor with the\r\n  French, Mr. Pitt, in the House of Commons, called him “our great\r\n  and good ally.” It was but two days after that the news came of\r\n  his defection, which every thinking man naturally expected.\r\n\r\n  ‘Mr. P. seems determined to do dirty jobs to the last; whilst our\r\n  enemies are almost at our gates, the subscribers to the loyalty\r\n  loan must forsooth be rewarded because many of them are his\r\n  Parliamentary friends. Should you hear your knight open himself on\r\n  this subject, remind him that a million or a million and a half\r\n  are wanted to pay the arrears of the Civil List; that professors,\r\n  whose stipends are fixed by Acts of Parliament, are in danger of\r\n  losing the profits of a couple of years from an abominable clause\r\n  in Burke’s Bill. Remind him of a remarkable circumstance in\r\n  Sully’s memoirs. When Henry IV. was in great distress for money it\r\n  was proposed to him to decline paying any stipends to the\r\n  professors in the University of Paris. “No,” said he, with an\r\n  honest indignation, “I will never consent to that; retrench the\r\n  expense of my table instead of touching their emoluments.” Such an\r\n  answer, and such conduct in conformity to it, reflected peculiar\r\n  honour on a prince who had never been trained up in the study of\r\n  polite letters\r\n\r\n  ‘Carnot[184] cannot be too much commended for ordering your\r\n  agricultural works to be translated and published. It was giving\r\n  his countrymen a mass of knowledge, founded on experiment not to\r\n  be procured in their own writers. He showed very good sense in\r\n  sacrificing party prejudices. Would Pitt have acted thus in his\r\n  situation?\r\n\r\n  ‘I have not read Wilberforce’s “Practical View of Christianity,”\r\n  nor am I indeed much solicitous about it, for my faith is not\r\n  built upon establishments but on the New Testament, which I have\r\n  considered with as much attention as most of our divines. W. is a\r\n  strict Calvinist, and is therefore orthodox, for he is supported\r\n  by our Articles of Religion. I who think that the Articles on this\r\n  head are not founded on Scripture, am a heretic, as I take you to\r\n  be also. It is very observable that the young theologians of\r\n  Geneva are at this day instructed much more in Ostervald’s[185]\r\n  Catechism than in Calvin’s books. The death of that worthy man and\r\n  excellent master of Italian, Isola, is an exceedingly great loss\r\n  to me, for he has managed all my little concerns at Cambridge for\r\n  twenty years. He can have left nothing for his family but his good\r\n  example. So respected was he by every one, that when a long\r\n  illness and his wife’s death prevented him from making his usual\r\n  earnings, and he was unavoidably loaded with heavy debts, they not\r\n  only raised for him 180_l._ by private subscriptions in the\r\n  Colleges, but in the following year the University gave him\r\n  100_l._ out of the public chest. I shall be very careful in\r\n  recommending his successor, for Isola always told me that most of\r\n  the Italians in England were rascals, and he therefore had no\r\n  communication with them when they came to Cambridge. I allowed him\r\n  twenty guineas a year, as few learn Italian. The profits from\r\n  teaching it are hardly sufficient to maintain one who has a\r\n  family; for parents in general are so foolish as not to require of\r\n  their sons the learning of that language, though their intention\r\n  is to send them into Italy.\r\n\r\n  ‘Adieu! You will repent provoking me to write.\r\n\r\n                                                       ‘J.

Having on my return from my\r\n  long peregrination on the Continent lent to a friend—who had lent\r\n  to another friend, whom we neither of us could recollect—the\r\n  twenty-five or thirty numbers which I had taken in before that\r\n  period, I postponed from time to time the completion of the series\r\n  in hopes of recovering the commencement of it. When at last shame\r\n  and necessity got the better of procrastination, what a treasure\r\n  of information burst upon me. No—so long as power without ——— and\r\n  without ——— shall have left an annual guinea in my pocket (blanks\r\n  are better here than words) not a number of the “Annals” shall\r\n  ever be wanting to my shelves. Hold—don’t take me for a Jacobin\r\n  now, nor even for a croaker. What I allude to is not any _common_\r\n  burden, such as you land-owners and land-holders grunt under, but\r\n  my own ten thousand pound tax—my privilegium—a thing as new to\r\n  English language as it is to English practice—sole and peculiar\r\n  fruit of the very particular notice with which I have been\r\n  honoured by ———.\r\n\r\n  ‘This waits upon you with a proof of a blank pauper population\r\n  table, framed for the purpose of collecting an account of them in\r\n  as many parishes as I can. Knowing so well your zeal for all\r\n  zeal-worthy objects, and mindful of your often experienced\r\n  kindness, I cannot on this occasion harbour a doubt of your\r\n  assistance. Is it worth while to give the table the indiscriminate\r\n  circulation of your \"Annals\"? At any rate your editorial Majesty\r\n  will, I hope, be pleased graciously to grant unto me your royal\r\n  letters, _patent_ or _close_, or both, addressed to _all_, and\r\n  if need be, _singular_, your loving subjects my fellow\r\n  correspondents; charging and exhorting them, each in his\r\n  parish—and as many other parishes as may be—to fill my tables and\r\n  send in their contributions.\r\n\r\n  ‘Along with the table you will find a MS. paper, exhibiting the\r\n  importance of the information I am thus labouring to collect; you\r\n  will print it or suppress it as you think best. I also send in MS.\r\n  a table of cases calling for relief; a general map of _pauper\r\n  land_ with all the _roads_ to it. Few, if any, of the projects I\r\n  have seen but what have appeared (the arch-project not excepted)\r\n  to bear an exclusive—at least a predilective—reference to some of\r\n  these cases, overlooking or slighting the rest. I send it in the\r\n  state in which I propose printing it for my own book; but, in the\r\n  meantime, if it be worthy the honour of a place in the “Annals,”\r\n  it is altogether at your service. This preparatory insertion will\r\n  turn to the advantage of the work itself, if any of your\r\n  correspondents (not forgetting their editor) would have the\r\n  goodness to contribute their remarks to the emendation of it. You\r\n  will not easily conceive—few heads, at least, but yours are\r\n  qualified to conceive—the labour it has cost me to bring the two\r\n  tables to this state. As to the work at large, it will occupy two\r\n  independent, though connected volumes. Pauper systems compared;\r\n  pauper management improved—the last the romance, the Utopia, to\r\n  which I had once occasion to allude. Romance? How could it be\r\n  anything _less_? I mean to an author’s partial eye. In proportion\r\n  as a thing is excellent, when established, is it anything but\r\n  _romance_, and theory, and speculation, till the touch of the\r\n  _seal_ or the _sceptre_ has converted it into practice. Distress,\r\n  at least, distress, the very life and soul of romance, cannot be\r\n  denied to mine; for in this short and close-packed specimen\r\n  already you behold it in all its shapes. Magnanimous president!\r\n  accomplished secretary! ye, too, have your romance. Heaven send\r\n  you a happy catastrophe and a _fettered land_ “a happy\r\n  deliverance.” Patience! patience! ye too, before you are\r\n  comforted, must bear to be tormented.\r\n\r\n  ‘Apropos of presidents.

This is the way in which I keep a\r\njournal; had I the abilities of Johnson it might be an excuse, but I\r\nam as idle as he without the talents that enabled him to think to\r\ngood purpose.\r\n\r\nLondon has passed away till the vacation without much to note, yet\r\nalways something; for I met many at Mrs. M. Montagu’s parties twice\r\na week, whose conversation was interesting. Very few dinners, for\r\nthe town was empty. Attended divine service at Mr. Cecil’s chapel,\r\nand ought to have made memoranda.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast at Wilberforce’s with Mr. Serjeant, Hawkins, Brown,\r\nThornton, &c., all members in committee on the assessed taxes.[187]\r\nMiss Griffiths, the friend and mother of my ever dear Bobbin at\r\nschool, coming to board with Mrs. Y.; these and many more articles\r\nall passed over, and, above all, the reflections which thronged in\r\nmy mind on the conclusion of that year which deprived me of my child\r\nand turned my heart so imperfectly to God Almighty. Without that\r\nevent how should I have been able to bear the stroke of the taxes,\r\nmy share of which will I fear be 100_l._\r\n\r\nHad I been out of debt it would have been comparatively light, but I\r\nam seized about some bills which yet remain, and which, if I\r\npay,[188] shall not be able to pay those taxes. I have advertised my\r\ncottage and eighty acres of land to let, but no chance of getting\r\nsuch a rent as I know I ought to have to make letting answer.\r\n\r\nI have been here with Lord Egremont above a fortnight. A good deal\r\nof rabble, but some better. Lord Spencer, Lord Althorp, Lord\r\nDungarvan, Lord Milton, Lord Stair, Sir John Shelley, Mr. James\r\nFeiryman, &c. I shall stay the whole vacation.\r\n\r\n_February 14._—Another great gap, in which time I was four days with\r\nthe Duke of Bedford at Woburn, with a strange party, for all in all\r\nI think the most strange I have been in for many years. Trevis, the\r\npseudo-Venetian Jew, who came long ago to England, has ran through a\r\ngreat fortune, reduced from 200,000_l._to 1,200_l._ a year, having\r\nshined with most satanic light in the annals of gallantry; Lady\r\nStanhope, Lady Cadogan, and a hundred more. Strong parts, wits,\r\noriginality (name evidently omitted here) and at seventy-one sings\r\nwonderfully; Lord Lauderdale, who is a very pleasant, easy, cheerful\r\ncompanion with knowledge, and so more capable of doing mischief;\r\nLord Maynard, Johns the parson, Bob Lee, Bligh, &c. The duke has\r\nmuch good sense and clearness of head.\r\n\r\nOn my return to town, Lord Carrington applied to me to get a drainer\r\nfor Mr. Pitt at Holwood. I told him none to be had but from a\r\ndistance, and at a considerable expense; that perhaps it was an easy\r\njob, and if so his own people could do it if the drains were marked\r\nout for them, and I would go and look when nobody there. Next day he\r\ncame again from Pitt with thanks, and desiring me to go when he was\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nI went, and examined the land. A hill wet from springs, the cure\r\nobvious. So I am to do it for him. He and Lord Auckland and Lord\r\nCarrington walked round the place with me, and then returned to a\r\ncold dinner, where we debated the Board of Agriculture, and Pitt\r\nseemed pleased with my idea of Government hiring the Bishop of\r\nLlandaff’s house for the Board, and so getting rid of the difficulty\r\nof not being able to quit Sir J. Sinclair’s without sixteen members\r\nagreeing in the affirmative, a stupid statute they made.\r\n\r\nBy the first reports of the Board, and a multitude of other expenses\r\nequally useless, Sir John ran the Board so much in debt that it\r\nbecame a question of great difficulty how they should be enabled to\r\ncarry on any business at all. Through a spirit of liberality in many\r\nindividuals, a subscription was set on foot, and ten guineas apiece\r\nby members and honorary members, which kept them for some time on\r\ntheir legs. The revenue of the Board went entirely to printers,\r\nabove eighty reports in quarto, with broad margins, having been\r\ngiven away to any who would accept them; and they were in general so\r\nmiserably executed, that they brought the institution into contempt.\r\n\r\nWhile Sir John Sinclair was engaged in this pursuit he thought of\r\nnothing but the establishment of his own character, and imagined\r\nthat his indefatigable exertions, misplaced as they were, gave him a\r\nclaim to the attention of Government, and, it is said, induced him\r\nto ask a peerage. But Mr. Pitt not acceding to the proposition, he\r\nnext desired to be a Privy Councillor. When this second gentle\r\nrequest failed, he set hard to work to form a party of his own in\r\nthe House of Commons in opposition to Government, which by degrees\r\ncompletely estranged Mr. Pitt from him; and he was, by the votes of\r\nthe official members, turned out of the chair. Lord Carrington\r\ntaking me to Holwood, we walked about the place for some time before\r\nMr. Pitt came down. When he arrived, ordering a luncheon, he said he\r\nhad desired Lord C. to bring me, that he might understand what\r\nmembers of the Board of Agriculture were proper to fill the chair.\r\n\r\nI named Lord Egremont. ‘He has been applied to,’ rejoined Mr. Pitt,\r\n‘and declined it.’ I then mentioned Lord Winchilsea; the same answer\r\nwas returned. I named one or two more, but the minister seemed not\r\nto relish their appointment. I next said Lord Somerville, who was\r\nfamous for the attention he had paid to some branches of husbandry.\r\nMr. Pitt’s reply was, ‘He is not quite the thing, but I doubt we\r\nmust have him,’ and the conversation concluded with an apparent\r\ndetermination that Lord S. should be the man. He was accordingly\r\nelected; and I, the same day, received the orders of the Board\r\ninstantly to look out for a house (because Sir John S. being turned\r\nout would no longer volunteer his), which I accordingly did, and\r\nfixed upon one in Sackville Street, into which the Board immediately\r\nmoved their property, and appointed the secretary to reside in the\r\nhouse, with an allowance of one hundred guineas a year for paying\r\nthe porter, keeping a maid in the house in summer, and finding coals\r\nand candles.\r\n\r\n_April 8._—A long gap, in which much has happened. The election, and\r\nSir J. Sinclair deposed. The world gives its all to politics, but it\r\nwas not caused solely by that motive; his management of the\r\n3,000_l._ a year was next to throwing it away, and gradually created\r\nmuch disgust; had his industry been under the direction of a better\r\njudgment he would have been an admirable president. I have hired a\r\nhouse for him and myself in Sackville Street. Crag, the clerk, wants\r\nan apartment, and I have befriended him with Lord Somerville, the\r\nnew president, much against my own convenience, for the house is not\r\nlarge enough; but, do as we would be done by, must be a rule far\r\nmore obeyed by me in future than formerly, and it is more a\r\nconvenience to him than an evil to me. It would be easy for me to\r\nprevent it, and time has been that I should have taken that part;\r\nbut God send me the power to follow better dictates. I have been\r\ntwice more at Holwood. I have written a new pamphlet, a ‘Letter to\r\nWilberforce.’ I have worked hard at my Lincoln report, and the\r\nelection, with the business public and private concerning it, has\r\nbeen on the whole such a worry, that I long for a week or two of\r\nprivacy and quiet, to render my mind more tranquil; it seems as if\r\nmy whole life is to be lost in a bustle. I am now going to Petworth,\r\nand within the week to Bradfield; there I hope to make a momentary\r\nretreat, and have time for recollection. I do not suffer anything to\r\ndistract me on a Sunday, or I should be lost in this hurry, and\r\neverything serious driven from my mind. I have anxiety also about my\r\nnew habitation on another account, which is the doubt whether they\r\nwill furnish it for me; if they should not, it will be a most heavy\r\nburthen of at least 200_l._, and an unjust one, elected as I am\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nLast Sunday se’nnight a new scene of sorrow and vexation. Arthur\r\nsent me a foolish letter of his written to Lloyd from Dover, by way\r\nof a stupid joke, describing an ideal conversation with some of\r\nO’Connor’s jurymen,[189] to frighten Lloyd, who sent it to Lofft,\r\nand he to Walker, to Erskine, &c. It was read in court at Maidstone,\r\nand Lord Egremont told me it had an immense effect, exciting\r\nuniversal indignation.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General pledged himself to punish it. The Jacobin\r\npapers kindly assigned it to _Arthur Young_, so all believed it to\r\nbe me. I had a letter contradicting sent to four papers, and have\r\nbeen in incessant worry ever since, writing for explanation,\r\nemploying Gotobed and Garrow, and seeing Lord Egremont often on it.\r\nI sent an express to the Attorney-General, with a letter to him, and\r\nanother to O’Connor’s counsel. All agree Lofft to be a base villain,\r\npretending so much friendship for all the family, and keeping the\r\nletter ten days in spite of Lloyd demanding it, and never asking any\r\nexplanation or naming it to Mrs. Y., Mary, or A. I have fretted\r\nabout this affair and worried myself terribly, and with reasons, for\r\nit will be the utter ruin of my son. Possibly a fine of 500_l._ and\r\ntwo years’ imprisonment if he is not able to prove it to be a jest.\r\nTo avoid being punished as a rascal, he must prove himself the\r\ngreatest fool in Christendom, which he certainly is, for the letter\r\nwas unquestionably a humbug.\r\n\r\n_June 23rd._—I have had a roasting three weeks languishing for the\r\ncountry; but, however, not discontented, and bringing my mind with\r\nsome success to submit cheerfully to everything I meet with. Arthur\r\nhas been in Kent and procured nine or ten affidavits of the jurymen;\r\nthose who refuse he never set eyes on till he made the application,\r\nso he has cleared himself to me, but whether it will do for the\r\nAttorney-General is another question. It is a sad business, and will\r\nbe very expensive, when I can ill afford it.\r\n\r\nI have been four days at Woburn with Lord Somerville—a very great\r\nmeeting. The duke desired me to preside at the lower end of the\r\ntable; he told me to keep Stone from it.\r\n\r\nI have been thrice at Holwood and conversed with Mr. Pitt every\r\ntime, but it is only on farming. No wonder. Reading Baxter’s\r\n‘Serious Call to a Holy Life,’ which I have done with great\r\npleasure, and have begun it a second time. I think it an admirable\r\nperformance. Charity and a universal intention to please God in\r\neverything are recommended with great ability.\r\n\r\nI have forgotten to add a word about my new habitation. It is an\r\nadmirable house, and Mrs. Young’s only apprehension was the plan of\r\nCragg, the first clerk, having apartments in it; but when it came to\r\nbe debated, Lord Carrington procured it entirely to me, with an\r\nallowance of 90_l._ a year for a porter, maid, coals, &c. Upon the\r\nwhole it is an arrangement which is equal in all to 100_l._ a year\r\nto me, and in comfort, saving me the trouble of thrice a year\r\nseeking lodgings, as good as a hundred more.\r\n\r\nI am thankful to God for it, and may He give me His grace not to\r\napply to ill uses the favour of His providence.\r\n\r\n_July 14th!!!_—This day twelvemonth it pleased God to take to\r\nHimself my ever dear and beloved child. In the evening at the Hall,\r\nmy wife and self, children, and Miss Griffith joined in prayer.\r\n\r\n[The remainder of the diary, chiefly detailing morbid religious\r\nintrospection, is not of sufficient interest to include.]\r\n\r\n_Notes from Memorandum-book_\r\n\r\n_March._—A dinner for fifteen poor children, 11_s._ 10_d._[190]\r\n\r\nAnother dinner for thirty-seven children, 16_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nAnother dinner for forty-seven children, 1_l._ 6_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n_April._—This month seven dinners to about forty-eight children each\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n_May._—Four dinners to about forty-eight children each time.\r\n\r\nThis year I sold the copyright of my ‘Travels’ for 250 guineas.\r\n\r\n_April 1799._—In London. I am alone, therefore at peace. I rise at\r\nfour or five o’clock and go to bed at nine to ten P.M.\r\n\r\nI have no pleasures, and wish for none, saving that comfort which\r\nreligion gives me; and the sooner I make it my only pleasure the\r\nwiser I shall be. I go to no amusements, and read some Scripture\r\nevery day; never lay aside my good books but for business. I have\r\ndined out but little, and wish for no more than I have. I get into\r\nhabits of reading and writing, and don’t like to quit them; privacy,\r\nand silence, and retirement suit me, and I am content. New servants,\r\nall; and the cook, a two-handed Yahoo, and cannot boil a potato. No\r\nmatter, I am passed being troubled at such things, but I like old\r\nservants, and can’t bear this change.\r\n\r\nMay 4 of this year I went to the opera with Mrs. Oakes;[191] and\r\nthat amusement which had for so many years been my delight, I met so\r\ncoldly as to be almost asleep through much of the performance. What\r\na change had taken place in my mind! This was the last public\r\ndiversion at which I have been present.\r\n\r\nI thank the Father of mercies that I have yet retained my attention\r\nto religion, that I have read few books but those of devotion, that\r\nI live very retired without any regret, that I rise at four or five\r\no’clock, and never omit my private devotions, morn and eve, and but\r\nrarely family prayer. Thank the Almighty goodness I have almost\r\nweaned myself from the world.\r\n\r\n_June 4._—The King’s birthday. I have been in Kensington Gardens to\r\nsee the King review 8,000 volunteers of London and Westminster.\r\nThese corps owe their origin I may, without presumption, say to me,\r\nand I should in a former part of my life have been full of\r\nmortification and envy at the gay and brilliant situation of others,\r\nwhilst I was a humble spectator lost in the crowd, ‘the mob’ as I\r\nshould once have called them; but, thank God, I had no such ideas,\r\nand am more free from sin of such thoughts than I am from that of\r\nentering this note of it. My mind was much occupied in thinking of\r\nsuch multitudes of people of all ranks, all ages, from infancy to\r\ndecrepitude, gay, lively, and running at the tilt of pleasure,\r\nfollowed by more splendid scenes of courts, balls, dinners and all,\r\nall to be in a few years in their graves, their souls in their\r\neternal doom, thoughtless as they may now be.\r\n\r\nI work myself as often as I can, and as much as I can, into\r\nmeditations on the utter vanity of all such scenes and thence to the\r\ninanity.\r\n\r\n_July 1._—Wrote Mrs. Oakes an account of my visits to the King’s\r\nfarm. I got Sir J. Banks to ask his leave to see his farm. He gave\r\nit readily, and said he would order Frost, his bailiff, to show me\r\neverything completely. I wrote, but my letter came, by mistake of\r\nthe post, after I was there myself; and as Frost knew the King would\r\nlike to see me, he went when likely to meet him on his return from a\r\nreview. The Queen, Prince of Wales, the Princesses, &c., were in two\r\nsociables, and the King on horseback, with his train of lords,\r\naides-de-camp, &c. He inquired who I was, and called me to him; rode\r\nup to the Queen, &c., and introduced me. The Queen said it was long\r\nsince I was at Windsor, &c., not recollecting me at first; they\r\npassed on, and then the King rode with me over his farm for two and\r\na half hours, talking farming, asking questions without number, and\r\nwaiting for answers, and reasoning upon points he differed in.\r\nExplained his system of crops, his reasons, with many observations;\r\nenquired about the Board, the publications of it, the ‘Annals,’ and\r\nasked if I continued to work on my ‘Elements,’ which I have been\r\nmany years about; recommended me to compress the sense of quotations\r\nin short paragraphs, ‘_as there are many, Mr. Young, who catch the\r\nsense of a short paragraph, that lose the meaning of a long one_;’\r\nsaid the work would be highly useful. Those who read the two letters\r\nof R. R. in the last ‘Annals,’ written by his Majesty, will see how\r\nclearly he expresses himself. He enquired about my farm, grasses,\r\nsheep, &c.; he has himself only 160 lambs from 800 ewes. His strong\r\nland farm is in admirable order, and the crops all clean and fine.\r\nHe was very desirous that I should see all, and ordered Frost to\r\ncarry me to two or three other things next morning. I found fault\r\nwith his hogs. He said I must not find fault with a present to him;\r\nthe Queen was so kind as to give them from Germany, and while the\r\nintention was pleasing, we must not examine the object too\r\ncritically. ‘_The value of the intention_, Mr. Young, is greater\r\nthan a better breed.’ He told me he learned the principles of his\r\nfarming from my books, and found them very just. Quoted particularly\r\nthe ‘Rural Economy:’ Cattle give manure, and manure corn. ‘_Well\r\nunderstood now, sir, but not so well before you wrote._’ When I said\r\nanything that struck him he turned about to tell it to the nobles\r\nthat followed. He is the politest of men, keeps his hat off till\r\nevery one is covered. An officer with a lady in a whisky drew in his\r\nhorse as he saw the King crossing the road, taking his hat off. The\r\nKing rode up to him, uncovered, and conversed a little, and\r\nafterwards said, ‘I think it is Captain Thorp, of such a regiment.’\r\nWhat a memory!\r\n\r\nEnquired much about the Duke of Bedford’s party at Woburn, &c. &c. I\r\nforgot three-fourths. He was in high spirits, and looks remarkably\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nMy son this year married Miss Jane Berry, daughter of Edward Berry,\r\nEsq. The connection arose from her being at school with my dear\r\nBobbin at Campden House, and afterwards visiting us at Bradfield.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelected letters from those received this year:—\r\n\r\nFrom Count Rumford on lime-kilns and cement for fire-places, &c.\r\n\r\n                                        ‘Brompton Row: Jan. 8, 1799.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—On my return to town last evening from Broadlands I\r\n  found your letter. I beg you will present my best compliments to\r\n  Lord Egremont and assure his lordship that it would give me very\r\n  great pleasure to visit Petworth and see the various improvements\r\n  he has, and is, introducing into the neighbourhood; but my stay in\r\n  England will be but short, and, as I have more to do in the\r\n  meantime than it will be possible for me to execute without being\r\n  very industrious, I must devote all my time to those occupations\r\n  in which I am engaged.\r\n\r\n  ‘I wish it were in my power to give you any satisfactory\r\n  information respecting lime-kilns, but I have not yet had leisure\r\n  to complete the experiments I had projected, and which are\r\n  necessary in order to enable me to form decided opinions on that\r\n  subject. The kiln I had constructed at Munich not being well\r\n  built, and being forced with too intense a fire before the masonry\r\n  was properly dried, cracked, and burst open from top to bottom, so\r\n  that no just conclusions can be drawn from the imperfect\r\n  experiments that were made with it.\r\n\r\n  ‘With regard to the best materials for withstanding the action of\r\n  intense fire, I believe common fire-bricks, as they are called, to\r\n  be one of the best. I am just now employing them in the\r\n  construction of open chimney fire-places, and they seem to answer\r\n  perfectly well. In laying them I have a cement of clay and brick\r\n  dust instead of common mortar.\r\n\r\n  ‘One of the best kinds of cement for resisting the action of fire\r\n  I ever met with was composed of equal parts of brick dust, quick\r\n  lime, and iron filings, mixed up with blood. It unites itself\r\n  firmly to metals as to bricks and stones of all kinds, and even\r\n  the most intense fire seems to have very little effect on it. It\r\n  may even be made to join metals to stones, or even wood to metals.\r\n  Our soap boilers in Bavaria use it to join the wooden tops of\r\n  their boilers to their copper bottoms, which it does in so\r\n  effectual a manner that they are very seldom found to leak. It was\r\n  from them I learnt the secret of the composition of this most\r\n  useful cement. I have no doubt but it would be found to answer\r\n  very well for plastering the backs and covings of open chimney\r\n  fire-places. I wish you would make a trial. If it should be found\r\n  to answer it would be a most important discovery, for in that case\r\n  bricks would certainly be as good, or even better, than\r\n  fire-stones for constructing fire-places.\r\n\r\n  ‘I am, dear Sir, with unfeigned regard and esteem,\r\n\r\n                                         ‘Yours most faithfully,\r\n                                                          ‘RUMFORD.’\r\n\r\n                     _From the Duke of Grafton_\r\n\r\n                                                  ‘Piccadilly: 1799.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—I had but just time to cast an eye on Mr. Wilberforce’s\r\n  letter last night, and seeing that the references are so many to\r\n  texts of Scripture, I must desire you to leave it with me till I\r\n  can have a good hour’s leisure to give it that consideration which\r\n  everything from him must deserve.\r\n\r\n  ‘I wish Mr. Wilberforce[192] and myself were agreed upon all\r\n  points as we are on the (I fear) hopeless attempts to abolish\r\n  totally the slave trade. Depend upon it that no one who knows that\r\n  gentleman so little honours him more than myself; nor do I impute\r\n  any opinions or dogmas to him which I have not learnt from his\r\n  writings. I believe him to be an upright, sincerely pious and\r\n  beneficent character, treading a road that leads to future\r\n  happiness, even should he be under great but involuntary errors.\r\n  Will he say the same of any one of those whom he improperly calls\r\n  Socinians? For, though they honour the memory of Socinus, they do\r\n  not follow his faith; far from it, for they acknowledge no masters\r\n  on matters of religion but Christ and His Apostles.\r\n\r\n                                          ‘Yours very faithfully,\r\n                                                          ‘GRAFTON.’\r\n\r\n                       _From Dr. Burney_[193]\r\n\r\n                                             ‘Dover: Sept. 11, 1799.\r\n\r\n  ‘My dear Sir,—Your letter [arrived] at Quarley after I had left my\r\n  friend Mr. Cox, and was returned to Chelsea preparing for a\r\n  journey into Kent. I have been here and hereabouts near three\r\n  weeks in the thick of all the military bustle of this county. My\r\n  headquarters are at my friend Mr. Crewe’s house in this town, the\r\n  best it affords, and is taken for three months. Mr. Crewe, being\r\n  colonel of the Second Royal Cheshire Militia, is quartered at\r\n  Hythe, but comes over frequently, Mrs. and Miss Crewe being\r\n  stationed here. The Duke of Portland and Lady Mary Bentinck came\r\n  hither on a visit last Thursday, and remained inmates with us till\r\n  yesterday morning. Being within eight or nine miles of the camp on\r\n  Barham Downs and seven of Walmer Castle, we have been there\r\n  several times, have dined twice at Sir Charles Grey’s, the\r\n  commander-in-chief at the camp, and twice at Walmer Castle with\r\n  Mr. Pitt, Mr. Dundas, and Lady Jane Dundas, who does the honours,\r\n  and is a most amiable, sweet, and charming woman. Mr. Ryder and\r\n  Lady Susan have a small house just by the castle, and Mr. Canning\r\n  is lodged within its walls. The Duke of York was there for several\r\n  days before he embarked for Holland. We, that is Mrs. and Miss\r\n  Crewe, with Lady Mary Bentinck, went in one coach, and the Duke of\r\n  Portland, with your humble servant, in another, at five o’clock on\r\n  Sunday morning to see the third embarkation launched. The wind was\r\n  furiously adverse, but it was done with wonderful dexterity,\r\n  quickness, and cheerfulness, without accident. The Duke of York\r\n  and Mr. Dundas were on the beach, the ladies were all in tears;\r\n  the soldiers in high _spirits_, and all fun and jollity. We\r\n  afterwards went to Walmer Castle to breakfast, and as the Duke of\r\n  York was not to embark till the evening, Mr. Pitt invited Mrs.\r\n  Crewe and her party to stay and take an early scrambling dinner.\r\n  This was accepted, and we remained in the castle while the cannon\r\n  on its ramparts were fired on his Royal Highness entering the\r\n  launch in sight of a fleet of at least two hundred sail of ships,\r\n  by which he was saluted; and we saw the flash of every gun, and\r\n  heard the report which was brought to us by the raging east wind,\r\n  _forte_, _fortissimo_. It was a glorious sight! God prosper the\r\n  expedition, and grant that those brave men who are gone so\r\n  cheerfully to fight our battles and those of all Europe, may come\r\n  home with honour and whole bones. The Duke of Portland’s youngest\r\n  son, Lord Charles Bentinck, sailed with the Duke of York, and\r\n  young Crewe sails to-day with the last embarkation, being\r\n  lieut.-colonel commandant of the Ninth Regiment of Infantry. The\r\n  hymn to the Emperor and Souvarow’s[194] march have been sung and\r\n  played to all these great folks with good effect and applause.\r\n  Lady Susan Ryder and Miss Crewe sing it admirably, and I join in\r\n  the chorus. I have obliged all the ladies mentioned above,\r\n  including Lady Grey, with copies of these compositions; they are\r\n  all musicians, and are the personages in the world most deserving\r\n  of such a favour, and where the granting of it will be of most\r\n  use.\r\n\r\n  ‘I congratulate you on the great events of this wonderful\r\n  campaign, not forgetting the acquisition of the Dutch fleet,\r\n  which, I am glad to find, is ordered to England. The Duke of\r\n  Portland received a letter yesterday before he left Dover from his\r\n  son, who is with Marshal Souvarow (pronounced Souvaroff), of the\r\n  battle of Novi, confirming all that the French have told us of the\r\n  death of their General Joubert, of Moreau’s being unhorsed, and\r\n  all his staff killed, wounded, or prisoners. It has cost the\r\n  Allies 5,000 men. However, it seems to put an end to all other\r\n  fighting and resistance by Jacobin armies of Italy.\r\n\r\n  ‘I intend returning in about ten days, but have a visit of a few\r\n  days to make on the road to Sir William and Lady Fawcett, at\r\n  Eltham.\r\n\r\n                              ‘God bless you.\r\n                                           ‘My dear Sir,\r\n                                                   ‘CHARLES BURNEY.’\r\n\r\n1800. _Bradfield._—I never come to this place without reaping all\r\nthe pleasure which any place can give me now. It is beautiful and\r\nhealthy, and is endeared to me by so many recollections, melancholy\r\nones now, alas! that I feel more here than anywhere else. Here have\r\nI lived from my infancy, here my dear mother breathed her last, here\r\nwas all I knew of a sister, and the church contains the remains of\r\nmy father, mother, and ever beloved child! Here, under my window,\r\nher little garden—the shrubs and flowers she planted—the willow on\r\nthe island, her room, her books, her papers. There have I prayed to\r\nthe Almighty that I might join her in the next world. All that\r\nlocality can give an interest to in this world is here—sweet\r\nBradfield, to use an epithet of my dear mother fifty years ago at\r\nBath!—the scene also of many and great sins; and of none perhaps\r\ngreater than the black ingratitude of never thanking God with\r\nfervency for the blessing of such a spot till misery turned my heart\r\nto Him, and oh! how cold my thanksgivings compared with what I ought\r\nto feel!\r\n\r\nTo me it has, however, often been a source of foolish uneasiness. I\r\nhave reflected on the increasing taxes and burthens on land and\r\nhouses in this kingdom as the inevitable cause of ruin to all little\r\nestates; they are gone or fast going in this country, and what hope\r\ncan I have that this should remain in the posterity of so poor a\r\nperson as I am?\r\n\r\nI have preserved it by a life of industry and singular success, or\r\nit had gone long ago. But such thoughts are wicked. All is in the\r\nhands of the great Preserver and Disposer of all earthly as well as\r\nall other existence.\r\n\r\nHow few years are passed since I should have pushed on eagerly to\r\nWoburn! This time twelvemonth I dined with the duke on the Sunday.\r\nThe party not very numerous, but chiefly of rank; the entertainment\r\nmore splendid than usual there. He expects me to-day, but I have\r\nmore pleasure in resting, going twice to church and eating a morsel\r\nof cold lamb at a very humble inn, than partaking of gaiety and\r\ndissipation at a great table which might as well be spread for a\r\ncompany of heathens as English lords and men of fashion.\r\n\r\nIn my way from Royston to Baldock, passing a village I saw a couple\r\nof cottages which seemed very miserable. Alighted therefore and\r\nentered one. The woman said she was very unhappy. I enquired why?\r\nHer daughter was now dead in the house. How old? Thirty-eight.\r\nMarried to a glazier in London. She had been down with her mother\r\nsome time for health in a decline, and died two days ago. ‘I hope\r\nshe died a good Christian.’ ‘I hope so,’ replied the woman, who\r\nseemed to feel very little. And it is the blessing of God that they\r\ndo not—they cannot afford to grieve like their betters. It was odd\r\nthat I should happen to stop and enter a cottage with a corpse in\r\nit, but nothing interesting followed. God forbid it should be for\r\nwant of my sifting and enquiring more—but nothing led to it. The\r\nhusband was expected soon, and the woman has a son, a miller, who\r\nkeeps her, a cow, and she had a good pig feeding at the door. She\r\nwas, however, thankful for the trifle I gave her.\r\n\r\nMy adventures increase and have a strange similitude. Passing\r\nthrough Millbrook, near Lord Ossory’s, some cottages, with corn in\r\ntheir gardens, on the slopes of a narrow sandy vale, caught my eye,\r\nbut speedily passing it was a second thought to stop the horse and\r\nwalk down to them. There are thirteen of them, and all inhabited by\r\nowners. A hemp weaver, who lives in the first I entered, gave me an\r\naccount of them all, and amongst the rest he named Underwood’s, who\r\nhad a large family, and was sadly poor. I went to it. Poor indeed!\r\nthe cottage almost tumbling down, the wind blowing through it on\r\nevery side. On a bed, which was hardly good enough for a hog, was\r\nthe woman very ill and moaning; she had been lately brought to bed,\r\nand her infant was dead in a cradle by the bedside. What a\r\nspectacle! She had four children living; one, a little girl, was at\r\nhome, and putting together a few embers on the hearth. My heart sank\r\nwithin me at the sight of so much misery, and so dark, cold,\r\ntattered and wretched a room. Merciful God, to take the little child\r\nto Himself, rather than leave it existing in such a place. What a\r\nsight! I entered another cottage, which was lately built, neat and\r\ncheerful, the Widow Scarboro’s; she earns something by washing, but\r\nher smoky chimney most uncomfortable. No wonder, with the old broad\r\nhigh fire-place. In the depth of winter the door must be open. I\r\ntold her how to cure it, but I wished to give her a Rumford grate\r\nand see it fixed. Impossible! and her evils are nothing to poor\r\nUnderwood’s.\r\n\r\nBut how strange yesterday to find a dead woman in a house, and\r\nto-day a dead child, and in such an accidental manner, as it seems,\r\nto enter just these houses. No chance; the more I see, the more I\r\nreflect, the more I am convinced that the providence of the Almighty\r\ndirects everything, but in a manner utterly incomprehensible to us;\r\nand it is the more incomprehensible from our paying so very little\r\nattention to it. If every one was to be careful to observe all such\r\napparently accidental events, they would have reason to acknowledge\r\nthe hand of Omnipotence. In three days how has what the world calls\r\nchance conducted my steps!\r\n\r\nThese poor people know not by what tenure they hold their land; they\r\nsay they once belonged to the duke, but that the duke has swopped\r\nthem away to my lord (Lord Ossory). How little do the great know\r\nwhat they swop and what they receive! What would be a blessing\r\npoured into their hands if they knew how to use it. What a field is\r\nhere! How very trifling the repairs to render these poor families\r\nwarm and comfortable! Above their gardens on one side there is a\r\nwaste fern tract now enclosed, from which small additions might be\r\ngiven them, yet would enable them to live from their ground at least\r\nmuch better than at present. What have not great and rich people to\r\nanswer, for not examining into the situation of their poor\r\nneighbours?\r\n\r\nTo Woburn Abbey. Here is wealth and grandeur and worldly greatness;\r\nbut I am sick of it as soon as I enter these splendid walls. I had\r\nrather be amongst the cottagers at Millbrook had I but the means of\r\naiding them. I will see Lord Ossory, and try to do something for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn these farming tours[195] of mine, vain ideas will too often rise\r\nin my mind on the importance of my labour to the public good; and\r\nwere the improvement of agriculture alone to be considered, I\r\nbelieve little doubt could be entertained. But what is the tendency\r\nof all these improvements except to add to the wealth and prosperity\r\nof a country that is already under a most heavy responsibility to\r\nthe Almighty for innumerable temporal blessings; repaid with the\r\nblack ingratitude of irreligion, and a general contempt of\r\neverything serious or sacred. Carriers’ waggons and stage coaches\r\nare passing here every hour in open defiance of the laws of God and\r\nman; and the Sabbath is the sure day of labour for all travelling\r\ngentlemen. What horses are they that rest, that can by any means be\r\nmade to work? Our fields are made to smile with cultivation for the\r\nprofits of men thankless to Heaven. Can such a country continue to\r\nbe thus blessed? I fear and dread some terrible reverse, and have\r\nthe only hope that the prayers of religious men, Methodists as they\r\nare called, may be heard, and avert the misfortunes we deserve. It\r\ndamps all vanity of public good attending such attempts as mine, to\r\nthink of the use that is made of great wealth. Affliction and\r\npoverty may do something in bringing nations, like individuals, to\r\ntheir senses; but to increase the wealth that adds to our irreligion\r\nand ingratitude, is of a very poor importance indeed, and too\r\nquestionable to permit one vain thought to be fairly founded.\r\n\r\n_July 7._—Breakfasting at Huntingdon from Kimbolton, after spending\r\njust a week with the duke and duchess. It has been so pleasant and\r\nagreeable that I am unhinged on quitting them. The duchess pleases\r\nme as much or more than any woman I have met these many years. Her\r\ncharacter in every worldly respect is most amiable. There is a\r\nnative ease, simplicity, and _naïveté_ of character in her which\r\ndelights me; and when I consider the life of the Duchess of Gordon,\r\nher mother, the great patroness of every dissipation, I am amazed at\r\nthis secluded young duchess, who never goes to London, loves a\r\nretired life, and is quite contented on a fortune very moderate for\r\nthe rank of her husband. She gave me her whole history, from going\r\none summer for some weeks to drink goat’s whey on the mountains many\r\nmiles beyond Gordon Castle, and running up and down the hills\r\nbare-footed, driving down the goats and milking them; and being\r\ndelighted with the place and the life, though no human being within\r\nmany miles except the family and an old woman of the solitary house.\r\nThis was the case of all the girls; she never went to school, and\r\nlaid in a fine stock of health, and with it a sweetness of temper\r\nand simplicity of character which, joined with an excellent\r\nunderstanding, contributed so much to form her as she is at present,\r\ncalculated to be a blessing to her husband. She loves him, and\r\nbehaves with a most exemplary and unexampled patience and mildness\r\nunder his connection with Mrs. ——. I like her greatly,[196] and wish\r\nI could add that she was religious. She goes to church often, she\r\nsays, and brings her four lovely children up to attend it; but I see\r\nshe has no sense or feeling of real religion, which I spoke of\r\nrepeatedly, and earnestly recommended. The next time they come to\r\nCulford they both promised to come and see me, and will do it I have\r\nno doubt. The spectacle in this age of seeing a very plain table, a\r\nplain unaffected way of living, and everything about them modest and\r\nmoderate in scale, very little company, and never at London, yet all\r\ncheerfulness and content, even under the above circumstance, speaks\r\na good heart and an amiable temper, as much as such can be good with\r\nthe Almighty coming in for so poor a share of its attentions. I do\r\nand will pray to God that He will give her His grace to change in\r\nthis respect, and then she will be a pattern for her sex.\r\n\r\n_July 7._—To Huntingdon, St. Ives, and Holywell, at the Reverend Mr.\r\nHutchinson’s, who was long at Kimbolton, and had livings given to\r\nhim by the late duke; [has] four stout, well-looking, unmarried\r\ndaughters, that have been marriageable some years. A common\r\nspectacle, and everywhere from the same cause: the fornication of\r\nmen with the abandoned of the sex robs thousands of such virtuous\r\nand good girls of husbands. The more I reflect, the more I see the\r\nreason of God’s wrath and denunciations against this vice in\r\nScripture, however natural it is, and however powerful the\r\ntemptation. The more the temptation the more the wickedness to throw\r\nso many into it, by depriving those of husbands to whom God has\r\ngiven the right, but of which the vice of man deprives them. Every\r\nman would have his wife, and every woman her husband, were it not\r\nfor whores and whoremongers. Christianity is in everything\r\nconsistent with reason, morals, and the religion of nature.\r\n\r\nAt St. Ives [met] a drunken beast, a doctor of divinity, is\r\nintoxicated every day; drunk about the streets; introduced himself\r\nto me, and breathed like a puncheon of rum in my face.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, 20th: Downham._—I have had a busy week and gained a great\r\nvariety of good intelligence; but what is it all but vanity and\r\nvexation of spirit if examined with view of a superior nature!\r\nHowever, it is my undoubted duty to do my best, and I must approve\r\nupon the whole of exerting as much industry for the Board as ever I\r\ndid upon my own account. My employment is not only lawful, but\r\nuseful; God grant me to render it as much so to the poor as\r\ncircumstances will permit. In this week I have been at Wing’s at\r\nThorney Abbey. A party of ladies [here], Mrs. Ansel of Ormsby in\r\nLincolnshire and two daughters. They attacked me, but with\r\npoliteness, on my rabbit article in the Lincoln report. I found from\r\ntheir conversation on Wilberforce and H. More that they are good\r\nChristians, so they might say anything; but we parted very good\r\nfriends. At March: Reverend Mr. Jobson and a vulgar steward, a\r\nprating but a useful fellow, Wandby, dined with me.\r\n\r\nAt Downham: Lemon, Dashwood, and a poor fen man Talbot. I have gone\r\non well for the object of my journey; would that I went on as well\r\nin the great journey to the next world! At church twice; Mr.\r\nDashwood in his sermon spoke very properly on a topic which I have\r\noften thought should be inveighed upon vigorously: the great\r\nindecency of people sitting when they should kneel, which is now\r\neverywhere so common; but in the afternoon a better congregation and\r\nno sermon! For a clergyman to have an audience collected ready to\r\nhear him and yet quit the church without preaching, how very\r\nlukewarm he must be in care of souls who can bring himself without\r\nviolence to such a conduct! Is this the way with Methodists as they\r\nare called? God forbid! With a church thus filled as that of England\r\nis, who can wonder at Sectaries increasing? All is poor work when\r\nmen are not in earnest—when they are not as animated and eager in\r\ntheir sacred calling as others are in their business and shops. A\r\nparson should always think: what would St. Paul do on this occasion?\r\n\r\n_Sunday, August 3._—Dined last Tuesday with the Grand Jury at\r\nCambridge, and in the afternoon Lord Hardwicke took me with him to\r\nWimpole. On the Thursday, a great public day, seventy-three at\r\ndinner, turtle, venison, and everything that could be. A Lord\r\nLieutenant’s gala which has not been these four years. Lady Cotton,\r\nSir Wm. Rowley’s sister, there all the week, and a Miss Coburn. Lady\r\nMargaret Fordyce has uncommon talents, and reading and languages,\r\nFrench, Italian and German, but I mistake if she is not a bit of a\r\nfury when she has a mind. I don’t like her countenance. Lady H.\r\npleases me better. Lord H. is very clever, has very good parts and a\r\nclear head, a man of business. I was pleased to find that he went\r\ntwice to church, and read a long prayer at night to all the family,\r\ntaken from the Liturgy. I shall be here a week, and have idled none\r\nof it away, but beat the country well for enclosures. I have not,\r\nhowever, broken my resolution of passing Sunday alone without being\r\n[misled], for even in such a family I had a farming expedition to\r\nthe next parish, and conversation is never religious—I hope I shall\r\ndo it no more.\r\n\r\n_Night._—Lord Hardwicke had all the family together, and read a long\r\nprayer taken from the Liturgy, from almost every part of it. I am\r\nglad to find a great Lord who is not ashamed of praying to God. May\r\nthere be many such!\r\n\r\n_4th._—I left Wimpole, and the 9th came to Bradfield after a journey\r\nof eight weeks, thanks to the Almighty, in health and safety. There\r\npassed a week, staying two Sundays. Mrs. Y. in great health, and\r\nwhen that is the case in too much irritation—God forgive her—life is\r\na scene of worrying, time trifled with, a book never looked in,\r\nquarrels and irritation never subsiding. My daughter and\r\ndaughter-in-law reading cart loads of novels. While at Bradfield I\r\nreceived from Sir J. Banks, confidentially, many enquiries about the\r\nmeans of encouraging the culture of hemp; they are therefore\r\napprehensive of a war with Russia. At the time of the Russian\r\narmament I was consulted on the same subject by Lord Liverpool, but\r\nthey do nothing except on the spur of the moment, and then never\r\neffectually. Heaven avert more wars, those scourges of humanity!\r\nThis first week of my second journey[197] I have laboured very hard\r\nin my enquiries, and travelled many miles on bad roads, not\r\nfinishing the day till six in the evening, and then dining and\r\nhaving much writing. Such a life I should earnestly wish to avoid if\r\nI had a home tolerably comfortable, but mine is so far from that\r\ndescription in almost every respect that I submit the better to\r\nbeing ever in harness. It is the will of God, and my duty is to\r\nsubmit with cheerfulness.\r\n\r\n_October 6th: Hounslow._—Found near twenty letters at the\r\npost-office, and, among the rest, two from Parker of Ripon, attorney\r\nto Sir Cecil Wray, Kilvington, and Allanson, to inform he had orders\r\nto hold me to bail on my bond to them on buying Knaresboro’ Forest,\r\nas Abbey of Northampton has not paid one shilling rent or interest.\r\nThis is a fine affair; it is true there is land security for the\r\n4,000_l._ of double the value, but who am I to get to bail me? I\r\nfear this is the hand of God working against me, and that He means\r\nme chastisement. The Lord’s will be done! I shall pray earnestly to\r\nbe spared, but if it is His will, be it done, and may He grant me\r\nresignation, patience, and submission to His correction. It comes\r\nheavy at the moment, for I was much injured at Enfield by coffee out\r\nof copper, as I suppose, with a violent purging colic and vomiting,\r\nand left by it in a state of great debility of body; this stroke of\r\nfresh anxiety cuts therefore. May God be appeased and spare me the\r\naffliction.\r\n\r\nLast Sunday I read much in Hale’s ‘Contemplations: Moral and\r\nDivine,’ in which the Providence of God is treated more to my mind\r\nthan in any other book I have read. I have derived on various\r\noccasions, as well as the present, much consolation from that most\r\nexcellent work, which I now earnestly recommend to my children, and\r\nhope if they should ever read these words, they will think of their\r\nfather and follow his advice to make that great lawyer’s book their\r\nconstant companion.\r\n\r\nOn the close of this century it may not be improper to look back\r\nthrough the period of my own recollections in order to reflect on\r\nsome eminent names that may be mentioned as forming the principal\r\nconstellation of talents which have distinguished the period; and\r\nthe more readily because I have had the honour of conversing with\r\nmost of them, and being well known to several. In minuting such a\r\nlist I may name the following, viz.: Burke, Pitt, Fox, Johnson,\r\nReynolds, Barry, Burney, Miss Burney, H. More, Wilberforce, Soame.\r\n\r\nThe following are the selection of this year’s letters:—\r\n\r\n         _From Jeremy Bentham, Esq., queries sent from the\r\n               Treasury to the Board of Agriculture_\r\n\r\n                  ‘Queen’s Square Place, Westminster; June 14, 1800.\r\n\r\n  ‘Dear Sir,—Underneath is a question, which I have just been\r\n  calling in Sackville Street to beg the favour of your answer to,\r\n  for my _own_ information. It is in contemplation to make the\r\n  purport of it the subject of a reference to the Board of\r\n  Agriculture from the Treasury. The occasion seemed to be of a\r\n  nature particularly favourable to the enabling the public to avail\r\n  itself of the services of the Board, and may perhaps have the\r\n  effect of placing the utility of that Institution in a new and\r\n  additional point of view; while the dignity of its members, and\r\n  the manner in which it is composed, will give such a title to\r\n  public confidence, in respect of the grand point of superiority to\r\n  all personal considerations, as would in vain be looked for in any\r\n  other quarter capable of being applied to for such a purpose. In\r\n  this light I have just been mentioning the matter to Mr. Nepean,\r\n  who entered so thoroughly into it as to say he would himself\r\n  propose it to the Treasury to make such reference.\r\n\r\n  ‘On enquiring I had the mortification of learning that the Board\r\n  had adjourned to some day in November: but would there be no such\r\n  thing as the calling an extra meeting, if not to the Board at\r\n  large, of a Committee for the purpose of receiving a reference\r\n  from such a quarter, and making a Report? If not, possibly the\r\n  opinion of the Secretary might be accepted of as the only\r\n  obtainable succedaneum to the opinion of the Board; for where else\r\n  could any other equally competent opinion be obtained? But\r\n  howsoever the matter may stand with regard to the Board and Mr.\r\n  Secretary, I hope Mr. Young will not refuse an old correspondent\r\n  the favour of an answer for his own guidance, and that as speedy\r\n  as possible; for it is for this answer that I wait to enable me to\r\n  fill up a blank with figures, the propriety of which is what is\r\n  proposed as above to be made the subject of reference to the\r\n  Board. If you are unable to guess my reason for interfering in the\r\n  business, so much the better, but if you _have_ your conjectures,\r\n  all I can do is to beg (which I do with the utmost sincerity) that\r\n  you would forbear letting them find their way, directly or\r\n  indirectly, to any person to whose lot it may fall to concur in\r\n  making the Report. It was at Mr. Nepean’s express recommendation\r\n  that I called in Sackville Street for the purpose of conversing\r\n  with you in person: but, if your absence be not fatal to the\r\n  business, I shall be much better pleased with the opportunity of\r\n  transacting it in this manner without any other communication than\r\n  what will show itself in black and white. I am not _sure_ but the\r\n  Report from the Board might be waited for without much\r\n  inconvenience till their regular time of reassembling: but till\r\n  Mr. Young’s answer is obtained, or is known to be unobtainable,\r\n  everything is at a stand. And a business in which the public has\r\n  an interest of no inconsiderable magnitude, and for the conclusion\r\n  of which all parties are impatient, sleeps, and, in short, if it\r\n  does not come at farthest before this week is at an end, the hopes\r\n  entertained of an answer from a quarter thus respectable must be\r\n  deserted. But these matters are so perfectly A.B.C. to Mr. Young\r\n  that I am sanguine enough to hope, if not for a definitive\r\n  solution, at least for an answer with an approximation, and\r\n  announcing a definitive solution in a few days, by return of post.\r\n\r\n               ‘I am, dear Sir, with all respect,\r\n                                  ‘Your faithful humble servant,\r\n                                                  ‘_Jeremy Bentham_.\r\n\r\n  ‘Now for my question—A sum having been allotted in March, 1793,\r\n  for the maintenance of a certain number of persons, of the lowest\r\n  rank of life, in provisions, clothing, bedding, washing, firing,\r\n  and lighting, how much, if anything, per cent. ought to be the\r\n  additional allowance made at present in consideration of the\r\n  intervening rise of prices? The calculation to be grounded not on\r\n  the prices of a particularly bad year (such as the present), but\r\n  on the probable average of a future term—say of twelve years.\r\n\r\n  ‘P.S.—Relative to the \"Annals\"—I have got a titbit for your\r\n  “Dragon” (the name Dr. Hawksworth used to give his magazine),\r\n  some facts which to me are as new as they are interesting,\r\n  relative to the effect of the rise of prices on the wages of the\r\n  self-maintaining labourers in agriculture, and the mode of\r\n  provision for the burthensome. The author, a very intelligent\r\n  and respectable clergyman, Mr. North, Rector of Ashdon in Essex.\r\n  They are contained in two or three letters:[198] the moral of\r\n  them appears to lean to two practical results, both of them I\r\n  believe as alien to your notions as to mine, viz. rating wages\r\n  and restricting the size of farms. At the same time what they\r\n  indicate is certainly a disease, the mischief of which, however,\r\n  would, I am inclined to think, be much exceeded by that of the\r\n  least mischievous of the above two remedies. But if capable of\r\n  an answer, they are, at the same time, highly deserving of one;\r\n  and this not only on account of the facts themselves, but on\r\n  account of the good sense as well as candour with which they are\r\n  delivered.\r\n\r\n                                                             ‘J. B.’\r\n\r\n        _From J. Symonds, Esq., to the Speaker of the House\r\n                          of Commons, &c._\r\n\r\n                                         ‘Euston: November 30, 1800.\r\n\r\n  ‘My dear Sir,—I came hither on Friday and shall go home next\r\n  Saturday. I hear there are three pamphlets lately published that\r\n  command much attention—Lord Sheffield’s,[199] Sir Thomas\r\n  Sturton’s, and “Candid Enquiries,” etc. When does your Board\r\n  intend to enter the lists? The Duke says it has shown him great\r\n  politeness by the attention it has paid to a proposal of his. If\r\n  you have not got “Islington on Forestalling,” &c. you should buy\r\n  it, for several statutes, absurd as they are, you will find set\r\n  forth clearly and methodically—I should not properly say clearly\r\n  (but this is no fault of the editor), for we do not know what\r\n  statutes may be said to be declaratory of the common law, or not.\r\n  Did you not rejoice with me that Sheridan animadverted on those\r\n  judges who had thundered their anathemas against forestallers,\r\n  &c.? I am persuaded that some of the riots owed their origin to\r\n  the intemperate language so extra-judicially used. I was sorry to\r\n  see the turn which affairs took upon the Report of the Committee.\r\n  Had Pitt been silent about the Jacobins, and had your friend\r\n  Wilberforce abstained from abusing Grey’s connections and Sir\r\n  Francis Burdett’s speech, there would probably have been a great\r\n  unanimity. The more Wilberforce endeavoured to exculpate himself,\r\n  the deeper he seemed to plunge. He was well advised by Sir F. B.,\r\n  who seldom harangues with any propriety, “to think more, and speak\r\n  less.”\r\n\r\n  ‘When I mentioned agricultural books I ought not to have appeared\r\n  insensible to the pleasure I received from perusing the greater\r\n  part of Burke’s pamphlet, very lately published by Dr. Lawrence.\r\n  You, I find, make there a distinguished figure in the foreground.\r\n  Do you approve of what Burke says about the distilleries?\r\n\r\n  ‘A few minutes before I came hither on Friday a very melancholy\r\n  event took place. Winterton, the Groom of the Chambers, had been\r\n  seen walking by the side of the river near the mill, not far from\r\n  the house, and was never heard of afterwards till his body was\r\n  found in the river. The Coroner is expected to-day, and he will\r\n  probably instruct the jury to bring in their verdict, “lunacy,” as\r\n  some of the servants had observed in him marks of insanity a few\r\n  days preceding.\r\n\r\n  ‘If you can spare five minutes from the service you pay to the\r\n  Board and to the public, favour me with a few lines. You live now\r\n  more with politicians than with farmers.\r\n\r\n  ‘What will be the result of our breaking with the Emperor of\r\n  Russia, whose conduct Mr. Pitt truly calls \"strange versatility\r\n  and caprice\"?\r\n\r\n  ‘Tell me a good deal, for the Duke has no regular correspondent in\r\n  Town now that Stonehewer is here.\r\n\r\n  ‘I was with you at Bradfield when Buonaparte’s first offers for a\r\n  peace were published.\r\n\r\n  ‘You said you thought the Ministry would pay attention to them,\r\n  and do you think that, upon the whole, we can make as good a peace\r\n  as them, the French having been almost driven out of Italy?\r\n\r\n                                    ‘Adieu.\r\n                                             ‘Yours sincerely,\r\n                                                       ‘J.

This was again debated\r\n  in the House of Commons in January 1798, and finally passed. See\r\n  Hansard’s _Parliamentary History_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 188:\r\n\r\n  In a memorandum-book of the preceding year occur the following\r\n  entries: ‘Receipts, 901_l._; debts, Dec. 31, 986_l._’ Debts seem\r\n  to have been a burden throughout A.

See _L’histoire générale de Lavisse et Rambaud_, vol.\r\n    viii. p. 358. It is to be hoped that Dr. Burney was in ignorance\r\n    of this.\r\n\r\nFootnote 195:\r\n\r\n  Note by A. Y. at close of year’s diary: ‘In the summer,’ in\r\n  consequence of much conversation with Lord Carrington on the\r\n  importance of enclosures, I proposed to him that I should take a\r\n  tour expressly for the purpose of ascertaining what the effect had\r\n  really been in practice. He approved of the idea, and desired me\r\n  to execute it; and, in regard to the expense, I told him that if\r\n  he would allow 100_l._, I would expend it in travelling, and\r\n  report to him the country travelled and the enclosures examined,\r\n  and then he might extend or not the undertaking at his pleasure.\r\n  He approved the plan, and I accordingly employed twenty weeks on\r\n  the journey.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 196:\r\n\r\n  In the _Annals of Agriculture_, vol. xxxv. p. 432, occurs the\r\n  following: ‘If a farming traveller comes to Kimbolton, and forgets\r\n  its mistress, may his sheep rot and crops blight! A young duchess,\r\n  ever in the country, loving it, and free from a wish for London—a\r\n  character that, if I was to give my pen scope, it would run wild\r\n  on such a subject.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 197:\r\n\r\n  Full accounts of these tours are given in the _Annals of\r\n  Agriculture_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 198:\r\n\r\n    These letters are inserted in the _Annals of Agriculture_, vol.\r\n    xxxv. p. 459.\r\n\r\nFootnote 199:\r\n\r\n    Lord Sheffield published _Remarks on the Deficiency of Grain\r\n    1799-1800_, and _Observations on the Exportation of Wool from\r\n    Great Britain to Ireland_. 1800.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n                       DIARY CONTINUED, 1801-1803\r\n\r\nPublic affairs and prophecy—The divining rod—The appropriation of\r\n    waste lands—The word ‘meanness’ defined—South’s\r\n    sermons—Projected theological\r\n    compendia—Correspondence—Journalising to ‘my friend’—Anecdote of\r\n    Dean Milner and Pitt—Death of the Duke of Bedford—Napoleon and\r\n    Protestantism.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 20._—It is in vain to complain of gaps; if I had but\r\nattention enough to write only two lines every day I should have\r\nhope of going on.

Duke of Montrose, Duke of Athol, and Lord Rossmore sent\r\nexcuses, but the Marquis of Abercorn, Lord Dalkeith, Lord Villiers,\r\nLord Barrington, Mr. McDougal, Mr. Baird, and two Scotch members\r\nwere there, the last but one a hard-headed, sensible man.\r\n\r\nMuch conversation, particularly farming. This morning Sir A. St.\r\nJohn Mildmay called to have my opinion of a Bill he is now bringing\r\ninto Parliament to enable the clergy to give leases of their tithes\r\nbeyond the term of their lives. The Archbishop has not negatived it,\r\nbut such a Bill can no more pass than the abolition of tithes; it is\r\nopen to such frauds that perhaps it ought not to pass.\r\n\r\nMy chief misfortune in having little society with well-disposed\r\nminds: I know few except Wilberforce and Cecil; the latter I rarely\r\nsee, and W. is so full of business that I might nearly as well be\r\nunknown to him. I will urge him to form a Society to meet once a\r\nweek for conversation merely on religion.\r\n\r\n_22nd, Sunday._—To be eager and alert in rising at 4 A.M. for all my\r\nsecular employments and sluggish on the Lord’s Day, when, if I rise,\r\nit must be to His worship, seemed long ago a snare of Satan, which,\r\nblessed be God, I have resisted. I was yesterday at the Society for\r\nBettering the Condition of the Poor, the Bishop of Durham in the\r\nchair; it is an excellent institution, and may call down the\r\nblessing of God—may that Being grant them his grace to do good from\r\nright motives! With the Duke of Bedford on the Smithfield Society,\r\nand the whole day full of business, which, on the Sabbath, I banish\r\nas much as I can from my mind. In the evening my son and daughter\r\nonly at home, and therefore I got an hour’s religious conversation\r\nwith them on the times and the Prophecies.\r\n\r\nI have been too negligent of improving such opportunities, but the\r\ntremendous moment in which we live, so lately having seen the\r\ncountry without King, without minister, with a famine, and seven\r\nwars! If it be not a moment to call people to a serious\r\nrecollection, nothing can ever do it.\r\n\r\nSo near the expiration of the 1,260 years of Daniel and St. John;\r\nthe Turkish Empire on the point of destruction; a strange and\r\nunthought-of establishment in Egypt, a country that is to have much\r\nto do in the return of the Jews—ourselves in India, they may have\r\nsome unknown relation to that phial to be poured out on the\r\nEuphrates to make way for the Kings of the East—altogether combine\r\nstrangely to give suspicion that we are on the eve of some great\r\nevents which are to usher in the final consummation of all things,\r\nand consequently the fall of the ten Kings of Europe. The times are\r\ntruly awful, and demand such piety and resignation as no other\r\nperiod of modern history even approached to.\r\n\r\n_23rd._—At the Lock yesterday. Scott is now my favourite preacher,\r\nand I have heard him ever since I came to Town with great pleasure\r\nand attention in spite of a very bad manner. His matter is most\r\nexcellent. Received the Sacrament.\r\n\r\n_24th._—Called yesterday on Mr. and Mrs. Montagu in their great\r\nhouse. It is said he has just lost a coal pit that was worth\r\n6,000_l._ or 7,000_l._ a year; I had a card for her Monday parties,\r\nand not having been, I apologised. I must now and then go after\r\nEaster. But all company of the sort is flat to me. I have just made\r\nup the annual account for 1800, and the loss upon the year is\r\n22_l._; this meeting a tax on paper which will cost 48_l._ a year is\r\nalarming. I had entertained many vain hopes that the work after so\r\nmany years’ continuance would have stood its ground, but I know not\r\nwhat to think. Now I must print only six instead of seven sheets,\r\nand try so for another year. If I lose then, I must give up the\r\nwork, much as it will hurt me. The ‘Agricultural and Commercial\r\nMagazine’ and the ‘Farmers’ Magazine,’ which approach more to the\r\nnature of newspapers, and which have contained hardly one paper of\r\nreal importance, have been selling well; such is the world, its\r\njudgment and discernment!\r\n\r\n_28th._—Yesterday the Board proceeded to Hyde Park in a body to see\r\nthe experiments of Captain Hoar on the _Virgula divina_. He, many\r\nyears ago, saw Lady Milbank’s surprising faculty of discovering\r\nsprings, and trying, found that he had it himself. He is recommended\r\nto the Board by Mr. Lascelles, member for Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nI found from the conductor of the waterworks at the reservoir then\r\nat work, that the twig in Mr. Hoar’s hand when he crossed them\r\nturned up in a surprising manner. He seemed, in the opinion of Sir\r\nJoseph Banks, to fail once, but in the four trials I watched, and in\r\nwhich I know he could not be acquainted with the direction of the\r\npipes, he succeeded completely. Next Tuesday another trial.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow will be published in the ‘Annals’ the first parts of my\r\nessay on applying waste lands to the better support of the poor. I\r\nprepared it some time ago for the Board, as it was collected in my\r\nlast summer’s journey; I read it to a committee—Lord Carrington, Sir\r\nC. Willoughby and Mr. Millington—who condemned it, and, after\r\nwaiting a month, Lord C. told me I might do what I pleased with it\r\nfor myself, but not print it as a work for the Board; so I altered\r\nthe expressions which referred to the body, and sent it to the\r\n‘Annals.’ I prayed earnestly to God on and since the journey for His\r\nblessing on my endeavours to serve the poor, and to influence the\r\nminds of people to accept it; but for the wisest reasons certainly\r\nHe has thought proper not to do this, and for the same reasons\r\nprobably it will be printed without effect. I think it, however, my\r\nduty to Him to do all I possibly can. Such events and circumstances\r\nI am well persuaded are entirely in His Divine management, and that\r\nwe are mere instruments in His hands. Whether I print or not is a\r\nmatter wholly unimportant, but the use made of it is in the hands of\r\nthe Almighty alone. I am well persuaded that this is the only\r\npossible means of saving the nation from the ruin fast coming on by\r\nthe misery of the poor and the alarming ruin of rates. God’s will be\r\ndone!\r\n\r\n_29th._—Yesterday at the Farmers’ Club. I have little relish of\r\nthese meetings, unless given to farming conversation, and this was\r\nnothing but wrangling about the disposition of money. Sunday before\r\nEaster.—Company and talk, eating and wine; sitting up late are ill\r\npreparations for the Sabbath.\r\n\r\n_31st._—The Duke of Bedford and Lord Winchilsea at the Club; filled\r\nup vacancies and settled the premiums. The Board greatly attended\r\nyesterday, and adjourned for the holidays.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hoar is turned over to Lord Egremont, of whom the Bishop of\r\nDurham said that he possessed of all the men almost that he ever\r\nknew the clearest head and most penetrating understanding. I asked\r\nLord Carrington to employ Arthur while I am absent; he said it was\r\nmean to make him a clerk—but everything is wrong that is proposed to\r\nthis man, even the things which, let alone, he would propose\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHonest industry in a lawful employment cannot be mean, especially in\r\nan employment that he likes. This is one of the world’s prejudices,\r\nand rotten like all the rest.\r\n\r\n_April 4._—At Bradfield. The pleasure of coming into the country\r\nfrom such a place as London is great and pure. The freshness and\r\nsweetness of the air, the quiet and stillness, the sunshine\r\nunclouded by smoke, the singing of the birds, the verdure of the\r\nfields, the budding out of vegetation, altogether is charming.\r\n\r\nI have only an old woman who keeps the house in our absence, and\r\nnever was so attended before; but no matter—I am quiet, peaceful,\r\nand living economically, and shall, I hope, be very well contented.\r\nDivine service was worse done than anything; Sharpe, who is past\r\neverything, preaches and reads worse than any human being; this is\r\nlamentable. That point is the glory of London; one can find churches\r\nwhere our attention is commanded by instruction.\r\n\r\nI never saw the wheat look better, thanks to God! My farm is the\r\nsource of disquiet as well as pleasure—such bailiffs as I must keep\r\nexecute everything badly, except just what they have always been\r\nused to; and with great expenses there are always many things sadly\r\nneglected. With such absences as I am forced to, this must be the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nI have read Barrow’s sermons chiefly since I came down. That on Good\r\nFriday excellent, on Whit Sunday capital, and on the prophecies of\r\nthe Messiah such as would convince an infidel, were not infidelity\r\ntrue hardness of heart.\r\n\r\n_5th._—At the Sacrament, none but Green and his wife, and the clerk\r\nand his wife. How much have the clergy to answer for! Reading Barrow\r\nand South’s sermons, ‘The Image of God in the Creation,’ which is\r\nfull of wit. Barrow is a most powerful writer, he pours out a\r\ntorrent of matter, a stream of mind, as Johnson said of Burke; an\r\namazing flow of conception and of expression, forcible and varied; a\r\nrich command of language, and such fertility that one of his sermons\r\nwould make ten modern ones.\r\n\r\nThe life I am getting into here of walking and reading is such a\r\ncontrast to that at London as to be a most pleasant change and\r\nrecreation to my soul and body.\r\n\r\nFrom January 20th I had been so loaded with business of the\r\nrequisitions from the Committees of Lords and Commons, and reading\r\n360 essays, that I was employed every day from morn to dinner. I\r\nrose at 4 A.M. regularly, sometimes sooner, even at 3 A.M., and\r\nneglected my ‘Elements’[200] entirely on this account. All was for\r\nthe Board, and not free from anxiety. Here I shall have a\r\nfortnight’s refreshment and relaxation, thanks to the Almighty for\r\nit, and that He blesses me with health to enjoy it.\r\n\r\n_7th._—Yesterday at 2 o’clock I walked to Bury, for I have neither\r\nhorse nor chaise to go in or on. Dined with my friend[201] alone. I\r\nhad much talk, and tried hard to impress her with good religious\r\nnotions, but I fear in vain; she will not be converted but by\r\nmisfortune and misery, her easy prosperous situation will prevent\r\nit. I can only pray for her.\r\n\r\nI have made an experiment in living here not unimportant. I drink no\r\nwine or beer, only a pint or one-third of a bottle of cider at\r\ndinner. I care not what I eat, I have only one maid and no helps,\r\nand could thus live for a trifle in a cottage. In such times such\r\ntrials may have their use beyond the Christian propriety of\r\nself-denial; but my collection of good books are a great comfort,\r\nwhich, if deprived of, I should miss terribly. I rise at 4 A.M.,\r\nwalk up to my neck in the garden pond, pray, and then read till\r\nbreakfast; read, walk, and farm till dinner, and so on till it is\r\ndark, and no moment hangs heavily on my hands. I reproach myself\r\nwith indolence for not going among the cottagers, but they come to\r\nme numerously, and having descriptive lists I know enough to do more\r\nthan I am able, but I ought to go to their houses and examine their\r\nstate well.\r\n\r\nI have been reading Watson’s Collection,[202] and am forming a table\r\nof striking passages, and think to have them copied for arranging\r\nwith the many I have already written, and may print it some time or\r\nother under some such title as this: _A course of reading on the\r\norigin, truth, and doctrines of the Christian Religion_. I know of\r\nno book of evidences that includes all; by taking the most\r\nimpressive passages on each subject from many books, and disposing\r\nthem in a lucid form, I think I could produce a very useful work\r\nwithout presuming to compose any part of it myself. May the Lord\r\nafford me His Spirit should I go on with the design, but with my\r\nemployment it would be a business requiring much time!\r\n\r\n_9th._—Dined with Mr. and Mrs. Balgrave. Balgrave is a good-tempered\r\nSuffolk parson, neglects the duty of his church, idle, indolent,\r\ndrinks his bottle of port and reads his newspaper, but what is\r\ncalled a respectable character, no vices, nor any imprudent follies.\r\n\r\n_10th._—Symonds dined with me and took a bed. The Duke of Brunswick\r\nmarching into Hanover will, he says, be a keen revenge.\r\n\r\nWhen he married our King’s sister, Lord Bute (who told the whole to\r\nS. while travelling with him in Italy) promised him the government\r\nof Hanover as soon as it should be vacant, with the King’s\r\nknowledge. The Marquis of Granby conveyed the assurance. When the\r\nvacancy happened the Prince of Mecklenburg was talked of. Lord\r\nGranby wrote to Lord Bute to remonstrate, who went to the King and\r\nQueen, and urged the real necessity of adhering to the promise. All\r\nin vain, the Queen prevailed, and her brother, not two degrees\r\nbetter than ——, was appointed. The Duke of Brunswick never forgave\r\nit, and when invited to England rejected the idea with anger.\r\nSymonds saw him at Venice and noted the asperity of some of his\r\nexpressions.\r\n\r\n_11th._—Reading Sherlock’s sermons. In those on the truth of\r\nChristianity, and a defence of the mysteries of it, I know none\r\nequal; excellent indeed and clear, persuasive, and convincing; but I\r\nhave some doubts on the vitality of his faith. In the third\r\ndiscourse of the second volume he says: ‘Here is a plain proof of\r\nwhat the work of the Spirit is. It brings proofs to the reason of\r\nman, but does not bring the reason of man to the proofs.’ I conceive\r\njust the contrary, the proofs themselves are clear, full, and\r\nabounding with what ought to produce universal conviction, but men,\r\nfor want of the Spirit, turn their back, neglect, or despise them.\r\n\r\nIt is the business of the Spirit to take away the heart of stone,\r\nand then the proofs are manifest: the heart and reason of man are\r\nreally brought to the proofs.\r\n\r\n_12th, Sunday._—The ground white with snow, and the wind cutting. I\r\nam up every morn at 4 A.M., and walk to the garden pond; habits will\r\ndo anything. I do not mind it at all, and sometimes stand in the\r\nwind till dry; it is, however, sharp work.\r\n\r\nA nonsensical letter from Lord Carrington requiring me to go to the\r\nTreasury for the 800_l._ for the Essays, which is entirely the\r\ntreasurer’s business. He is as unfeeling as a log; this is a return\r\nfor my being at work from 4 A.M. in the morning for ten weeks. I\r\nshould once have been full of indignation and abhorrence; thank God,\r\nI am more calm. I shall go on Friday instead of the Monday\r\nfollowing. But I wish he had let me alone. I am vexed, but the world\r\nis full of nothing but great miseries or teasing vexations, the more\r\nthe better; they wean us from it effectually.\r\n\r\nI have been here ten days and have not visited one poor family. My\r\nheart reproaches me. I have given as much as I apprehended I could\r\nafford, but that is laziness. The cold winds and sleet have kept me\r\ntoo much in the house. It is easier to give than to be active in\r\ndoing good. I have four days more. Oh, let me be stirring in doing\r\ngood! Indolence is inexcusable. If I thought I had but a little time\r\nto live, with what energy would all this be done! And how soon may I\r\nbe trembling on a death bed! Have mercy on me, O God, and give me\r\ngrace to serve Thee with activity and vigour. Read the whole book of\r\nJob. I can read, think, speculate, write, and meditate, but in doing\r\ngood am negligent and slothful. I have had a passing fit of\r\nmelancholy from looking at my ever dear daughter’s picture, which I\r\ncarry with me everywhere, and never think of her but to bless God\r\nfor having in some measure (how imperfectly!) brought me to Himself.\r\nAge coming on apace; the world fading faster still; horrible\r\nthreatenings in the aspect of public affairs; small hope of any\r\ncomfort underived from religion. How black and dreary would all my\r\nprospects be were it not for the consolation I draw from a most\r\nlively and never varying faith in the truth of Christianity, in the\r\n_full assurance_ of immortality! What would be my situation without\r\nthis only balm of my existence? Domestic comfort a blank; my friends\r\ndropping into the grave, and the infirmities of age in near\r\nprospect.\r\n\r\nGratitude and thanksgiving to my blessed Saviour for affording me\r\ngrace to believe; and with it all the comfort that remains for me in\r\nthis world. My child! My child! Oh, may we meet in heaven!\r\n\r\n_13th._—The poor people of the neighbouring villages crowd here to\r\nmy great distress. I give all something, and wish I could give more;\r\nbut I dread falling into the dark impropriety of giving too much, of\r\nmaking what would seem and be a parade of charity or generosity with\r\nother people’s money, which is somewhat the case with a man who\r\ngives while he has debts unprovided for. I truly know not what\r\nrightly to do in this case. The evil just described is great, and\r\nought to be avoided, but at the same time what ought I to think of\r\nmyself who have been always ready to spend and run in debt for forty\r\nyears together; and then should take up so strictly as to do nothing\r\nfor miserably poor people in such times as these? Surely on such an\r\noccasion we should be exerting every power to relieve them!\r\n\r\n_20th._—Friday to London. Saturday, Farmers’ Club. An argument with\r\nLord Egremont, &c., on land for the poor; everybody is against it.\r\nWhat infatuation!\r\n\r\n_21st._—Last night at Mrs. Montagu’s conversazione. I had some\r\n[talk] with the Bishop of Durham, who agrees with me on the poor;\r\nwith Lady Harcourt, who wants restrictions on farmers; with Lord\r\nSomers, who told stories of supernatural movements of furniture in\r\nNorfolk.[203] I left it very early though invited for all March and\r\nApril. This is the first of my going.\r\n\r\nLondon very disagreeable to me, and has made me compare in my mind\r\nmy present situation with a large income, and that of living in a\r\ncottage in the country upon 100_l._ a year, without trouble or\r\nanxiety or business, except to make my peace with God. I liked my\r\ntime alone with my old woman [servant] at Bradfield much better than\r\nhere. I had nobody to wrangle and quarrel with me.\r\n\r\n_May 4._—Yesterday I was at church in the morning with Mrs. O. Oakes\r\nat the Lock, and heard Scott, and in the evening at the Surrey\r\nChapel to hear Rowland Hill. Neither of them pleased, though she\r\nadmits Scott’s matter was excellent. She was most struck with the\r\nextreme fervency of Mr. Wilberforce’s devotion, who, sitting in the\r\nreading desk for the convenience of hearing better, she saw him\r\nclearly. Bought Rowland Hill’s sermon on the Sunday Schools against\r\nthe attack of Bishop Horsley,[204] who is, from all I hear of him,\r\nsuch a bishop as Suffolk parsons are clergymen. Scott thinks that\r\nevil spirits do work on our souls, and to me it is remarkable that\r\nhe says the imagination is their great field. I have reason enough\r\nto believe him in the right. These are enquiries in which we have no\r\nother clue to guide us but Scripture, and surely there we find\r\nproofs without end of the agency of evil spirits; for my own part I\r\nhave no doubt of it.\r\n\r\n_Bradfield._—As there was no church this morning, I had eleven poor\r\nwomen from the village to talk to upon their neglect of church. I\r\nread many passages on public worship and prayer out of Dodd’s\r\nCommentary on the Bible, and explained, preached, and reasoned with\r\nthem. One made a defence, and was inclined to prate. I took it\r\ncoolly, and presently brought her to better reason. I doubt they\r\nliked a sixpence apiece better than my sermon, yet three of them\r\ncried. How much more docile and teachable are the poor than the\r\nrich! One might gradually do much with the poor, but very little\r\nindeed with their betters. God opens the hearts of the one, and\r\nhardens those of the others as a punishment for their pride and\r\ningratitude.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Bedford has asked Lord Carrington to the sheep shearing.\r\nLord Egremont called, he remarks that the Chancellor, Lord Rosslyn,\r\nand Lord Grenville, &c. &c., all have in the late debates gone out\r\nof the way to abuse the Board of Agriculture, and remarks that\r\nkeeping a Board only to treat it in this manner is preposterous.\r\n\r\n_7th._—My publications are very well adapted to take off the edge of\r\nall worldly infatuated admiration or dependence on the things of\r\ntime in comparison of those of eternity. Washington’s Letters have\r\nbeen advertised to the expense of 5_l._ or 6_l._, and I do not\r\nbelieve that 100 are sold, and my enquiry into the cottage system\r\nfor poor people will have no more effect on Government or the\r\nLegislature than if I had whistled ‘Alley Croker.’ So much the\r\nbetter perhaps for the good of my soul.\r\n\r\n_25th._—Mr. Hoole called and was let in. He has heard at a great\r\ntable (he did not say where) a very so-so account of Lord\r\nCarrington—fidgeting, restless, dissatisfied, ambitious, avaricious,\r\nwith a mere show of parts and knowledge. He has made immensely by\r\nthe loan; and the richer he grows, so much the worse. The eldest\r\ngirl said to Mr. H. when he called: ‘My papa used to have prayers in\r\nhis family; but none since he has been a peer.’ What a motive for\r\nneglecting God! Also he is a dissenter and a democrat. A Unitarian\r\nhe may be, but certainly no democrat. The Lord show mercy to him,\r\nand by interrupting his prosperity or lowering his health, bring him\r\nto repentance!\r\n\r\n_26th._—Yesterday I dined with the Duke of Grafton, and he asked me\r\nwhen the election of president and secretary of the Board was, for\r\nhe heard there was an intention of turning Lord Carrington and me\r\nout. He said his answer was, as to Lord C., there were reasons which\r\nmight account for that, but what can Mr. Y. have done? ‘Oh, he is\r\ncareless, and does nothing,’ and so I dare say there are people to\r\nreport and perhaps so think. Lord Somerville in revenge, I doubt\r\nnot, hates everything belonging to the Board, and wishes to come in\r\nand sweep everyone clear away, in order to introduce creatures of\r\nhis own, and this, uniting with Gifford’s scandals and slander about\r\nthe Board intending to pull down the club in the ‘Porcupine’ and\r\n‘Anti-Jacobin Review,’[205] gains the attention of fools, and\r\nmingled by the depravity of the world, is circulated and believed.\r\nBut of all farces, that of my doing nothing is the most precious.\r\nWhat I have done through the whole session of the Board surpasses\r\ncredibility, almost to myself, and nothing but rising at 4 A.M. in\r\nthe morning could have enabled me to go through it. The first spare\r\nhalf day I have I will make a list of all I have done, and see if\r\nthey will not acquit me to my own heart. Oh, did I serve my God as\r\nwell as I have served the Board! Could I review my services to my\r\nRedeemer as satisfactorily, happy should I be!\r\n\r\n_27th._—Symonds and Hoole dined with us, and, as the former will see\r\nthe Duke of Grafton to-day, I gave him a message card, on one side\r\nof which is ‘_Some use in rising at 4_ A.M.,’ and on the other as\r\nfollows: ‘From January 20 to May 23 are 90 days, Sundays and\r\nvacation excluded, 50 Boards and Committees; 340 essays read, and\r\nevery one commented on. Report to the House of Commons on Potatoes.\r\nReport to the Lords on Grass Lands. Enquiry into cottagers’ land\r\npublished, but drawn up for the Board. Memoir on Salt, from more\r\nthan fifty authors. Ten new premises framed. Memoir on wastes,\r\nparing, burning, and arable land.’\r\n\r\nIf for such employment I am stigmatised for doing nothing, it shows\r\nthat in order to please, it matters not what we do, caprice will be\r\nthe only judgment. What conclusion is to be drawn from such cases?\r\nServe God truly, and as to man trouble not thyself about him; let\r\nthis be the golden rule, and it will bring peace at the last.\r\n\r\n_28th._—Lord Carrington fretting and worrying, and upon the full\r\nfidget about the newspapers’ abuse, and the criticisms in the House\r\nof Lords upon the publication of the Board; swearing that he will\r\nallow no nonsense to be published, and this will be more absurd and\r\npragmatical than ever. Oh! Mr. Pitt, Mr. Pitt, that thou shouldest\r\nhave formed such a Board as this, and then permit it to frame such a\r\nconstitution as should render it absolutely dependent on the folly\r\nand caprice of a president! What might it not have done had its laws\r\nbeen what they ought to have been!\r\n\r\nDalton, of Yorkshire, gave me a long account of his taking Hyder Ali\r\nwhen only the colonel of 500 horse—a soldier of fortune.[206] Lord\r\nEgremont came up from Petworth, where, he tells me, not a loaf for\r\nthree days and a half, and a mutiny among the volunteers.\r\n\r\n_29th._—Dined yesterday at Lord Winchilsea’s. There were the Duke of\r\nBedford, Lord Egremont, Lord Romney, Lord Somerville, Mr. Calhoun,\r\nMr. Northey, Mr. Conyers, and myself: much farming. Lord Romney gave\r\nLord Egremont a guinea, to receive fifty when he produced a tench\r\nthat weighed seven pounds.\r\n\r\nYesterday the Committee voted 50_l._ to my son for his labour in\r\narranging &c., during thirteen weeks, the Reports from inclosed\r\nparishes to the House of Commons. I thanked them very awkwardly, and\r\ntalked of gratitude, for it came on unexpectedly; that readiness\r\nwhich is never at a loss I have not an atom of. My heart always\r\nspeaks at a sudden; whereas in many cases the head is most wanted.\r\nBut the fault was on the right side, it was more than I expected.\r\n\r\n_June 6._—Charming weather for the country, now in its full beauty,\r\nand I am stoved up in this horrid place. Lord C. talked of\r\nadjourning the Board on Tuesday, which I hope much he will do. The\r\n15th is the Sheep Show at Woburn; it will be the 20th before it is\r\npossible for me to see Bradfield, and hardly then; the longest day\r\nbefore a man gets into the country!!! Let them turn me out of my\r\nsecretaryship and I shall not regret it, but down all discontent; it\r\nis God’s will, and my duty is to be thankful for all.\r\n\r\nIt is a comfort which exceeds all others, that as age advances the\r\nend of life is viewed as a mere change of residence, and the mental\r\neye fixed on heaven, with full confidence in the promises of God. I\r\nwould not give this conviction for the wealth of the Indies, for the\r\nempire of the world. And what does one lose by religion? I enjoy all\r\nsuch pleasures of life as are unattended by remorse, just as much,\r\nor more indeed, far more, than I did while I was a dissipated\r\ncharacter. Reading, composition, serious conversation on any topic\r\nworth discussing, the rural beauties of Nature, and the pleasures of\r\nagriculture, friendship, affection, not love, as it is called, the\r\nwhole of which I fear is founded in lust, and proves nineteen times\r\nin twenty the tyrant of the breast, and the fertile source of ten\r\nthousand miseries! Happy those in whom it terminates in a settled,\r\nquiet, tranquil friendship, sufficient to satisfy without the\r\nwanderings of the heart that lead to so much misery.\r\n\r\nI was here (at Bradfield) three weeks at Easter after a severe\r\nconfinement to incessant business; I am now again in the same deep\r\nretirement, the life of a hermit, after eight weeks of business and\r\nbustle. I feel how vast the benefit is to have these periodical\r\nretirements from the world in silence and solitude. Had I gone\r\ndirectly from London on my tour, plunging from one busy scene to\r\nanother, my mind would have had no time to cool, none to settle into\r\nany calm and tranquil state for reflection, which is unfavourable to\r\nthe growth of religion, of morals, nay, of talents to perform\r\nanything of consequence. A round of business or dissipation thus\r\nunbroken is mischievous to the heart, ties it to the world, and\r\nunfits it for every effort of regeneration and repentance, or of\r\nmeditation and philosophy.\r\n\r\nLord Euston is going the tour of Suffolk, ordering returns to be\r\nmade of all carts, waggons, horses, mills, and ovens; a step\r\npreparatory in the expectation of an invasion. But it is in\r\neveryone’s mouth that with such a price of corn half the country\r\nwould join an enemy. I must freely confess I dread the result. We\r\nhave no hope but in the protection of the Almighty, who has hitherto\r\nso wonderfully protected us; and what has been the gratitude shown\r\nto Him?\r\n\r\nMost melancholy is the reflection. Our rulers are truly infatuated,\r\nto have done nothing for the assistance of the poor, but leave them\r\nto such trying times without even showing a disposition to take any\r\nsteps that could be effective. To do nothing to give relief, when\r\nland for the poor does relieve them so beneficially wherever they\r\nhave it, is a cruel infatuation. To see poor rates at their present\r\nenormous height and the poor in misery—yet where they have land, to\r\nfind rates 3_d._ or 4_d._ or 9_d._ in the £, and the poor in a state\r\nof ease and comfort—one would think should speak feelingly and\r\npowerfully—but no such thing. Men are governed by their stupid\r\nprejudices, and have too much pride to permit their eyes to be\r\nopened. Had an Act passed last session that had the effect of thus\r\nassisting the poor, instead of the pernicious system by rates, and\r\nsome progress were now making in every county to carry it into\r\nexecution, we should not hear such opinions advanced, because they\r\nwould be groundless; the poor labourers, seeing such steps taken for\r\ntheir comfort and to free them from the ineffective thraldom of\r\nparish rates, would be patient and quiet. At present they see\r\nnothing done or doing for them, and have their hearts almost broken\r\nby penury—without resource—without hope.\r\n\r\nIn such a situation who would wonder to see men join an enemy in\r\ncrowds? Heaven forbid that this infatuation of Government be not\r\nprovidential, and the means by which the Deity may mean to punish\r\nthe nation for and by its sins!\r\n\r\nThe trumpeter of the Corps of Yeomanry came to me with a written\r\nengagement to forfeit 5_s._ the first absence and 10_s._ 6_d._ every\r\nsuccessive one if we do not meet the first Friday of every month. I\r\nwas always exempted on account of my necessary absence; however, as\r\nthey expect to be called into actual service, I would not now retire\r\nwhen an invasion is expected, so I signed; but when the alarm is\r\nquite blown over—should that please the Almighty—I shall withdraw,\r\nfor I am too old and too weak, and my pursuits too far off and too\r\nnumerous to permit attendance.\r\n\r\n_September 7_ [on tour, at Dunstable].—Breakfasted with Mr. Parkyn,\r\nand then went to meet a person who instructs people in plaiting\r\nstraw, and I bargained with him at 30_s._ a week for a girl to be\r\ninstructed—a month will do; that is 6_l._, and the journey there and\r\nback, about 4_l._, so for 10_l._ I shall be able to introduce this\r\nmost excellent fabric among our poor. The children begin at four\r\nyears old, and by six earn 2_s._ or 3_s._ a week; by seven 1_s._ a\r\nday; and at eight and nine, &c., 10_s._ or 12_s._ a week. This will\r\nbe of immense use to them.\r\n\r\nGot to Woburn by 2 P.M., sat down and wrote for two hours and a\r\nhalf, then dressed, but did not dine till nearly 8 P.M. The Duke of\r\nManchester there with Lord Preston, Mr. Cartwright, and Edwards, the\r\nbookseller, who is putting the library to rights and showing how to\r\nmake the catalogue. I was surprised to learn from him that a man\r\ncould not lay out in one year more than 5,000_l._ judiciously in\r\nbooks; that Lord Spencer has been fourteen years expending\r\n25,000_l._, and has the best library in England, perhaps better than\r\nthe King’s. He tells me the nation [France] bought L’Héritier’s[207]\r\nlibrary, and gave it to the Botanical Garden. Miss Knight,[208]\r\nauthoress of the continuation of ‘Rasselas,’ whom I met at\r\nKedington’s, lent Dolmien’s[209] ‘Life at Naples,’ through Lady\r\nHamilton’s interest with the Queen. He wrote to her from prison.\r\n\r\nDid not get to bed till past 11 P.M. Such hours and fasting from 9\r\nA.M. in morn to 8 P.M. at night did not agree with me. I waked at 4\r\nA.M., and having a lamp, rose, washed, prayed, and sat down by\r\ncandlelight to my notes and finished them.\r\n\r\nLord Preston swears; it hurts me to hear him. I certainly ought to\r\nconvert such people and reproach myself, and confess the sin every\r\nday in my catalogue to God; but I go on and do it not. If I had wit\r\nI could laugh at it, but I have no more wit than a pig.\r\n\r\nThe following are selected from this year’s correspondence:\r\n\r\n_From T. Symonds, Esq., describing Trinity College Establishment,\r\nRevenue, &c._\r\n\r\n                                         ‘Cambridge: March 20, 1801.\r\n\r\n  ‘You desire me, good friend, to send you a long letter from this\r\n  place, but I could more easily find materials to write one to our\r\n  friend Charles Cole, from his being perfectly conversant with\r\n  every one here, and with almost everything. You observe very\r\n  right, that landlords cannot come into a share of the wealth of\r\n  their tenants but by a corn rent. This I have insisted upon of\r\n  late frequently at Bury. The present state of the University is an\r\n  indisputable proof of it. The pressure of the times is hardly felt\r\n  by its members. Will you not think so, when you hear that the\r\n  revenue of this College amounted to nearly 16,000_l._ last year,\r\n  and that the eight senior fellows received more than 300_l._ each,\r\n  and the junior half of that sum? They have been obliged to raise,\r\n  however, the price of the commons (as they are called) from\r\n  fifteen to eighteen pence. But I sit down here every day for this\r\n  sum to a dinner, which gentlemen of a thousand a year cannot give\r\n  often with prudence.\r\n\r\n  ‘The papers, I presume, have informed you of the trial of our\r\n  plate stealers last week.\r\n\r\n  ‘The whole business was ill conducted. The man who sold to the Jew\r\n  the medals of King’s College for 70_l._, the plate of this for\r\n  300_l._, and the plate of Caius for 500_l._, pleaded guilty, and\r\n  in consequence of a free pardon to appear against the Jew, who,\r\n  though acquitted at these Assizes, will probably be hanged at the\r\n  next. Grimshaw, the chimney sweeper, is the only victim at\r\n  present. Your friend Simeon was not wanting in his visits to him.\r\n  He told an acquaintance of mine \"that he found Grimshaw’s\r\n  conversation delightful; that he had grace to die; and that the\r\n  sooner he was executed the better, for fear this grace should\r\n  evaporate.\" Should it ever be my lot to be condemned for\r\n  execution, I will immediately apply to you for consolation. Simeon\r\n  could work no conviction in the Jew; this will not surprise you.\r\n\r\n  ‘I saw in the papers a list of the dancers at Lady Carrington’s\r\n  ball; but, to my astonishment, did not discover your name. The\r\n  papers have raised Lord C. to the degree of Viscount;[210] it\r\n  would be too insulting for a man recently in business to step\r\n  above the heads of our ancient Barons. I should have told you that\r\n  we have here a young nobleman of unblemished character. I mean\r\n  Lord Henry Petty, whose knowledge and abilities are such, both in\r\n  writing and speaking in public, as to lead me to imagine that he\r\n  cannot fail to make a distinguished figure in Parliament. By the\r\n  bye, there seem to be some members of the House of Commons who are\r\n  jealous of your Board.\r\n\r\n                                           ‘Yours sincerely,\r\n                                                       ‘J. SYMONDS.’\r\n\r\n_January 24, 1802._—A great gap; but from coming to London in\r\nNovember to quitting it the following month I wrote journal letters\r\npaged to my friend.[211] Through the Christmas holidays a blank. I\r\nhave subscribed to the Lock Hospital 5_l._ 5_s._, and go every\r\nSunday. Wilberforce always there taking notes of Scott’s sermons.\r\n\r\nIn the great business of my salvation I go on slowly, struggling\r\nhard, however, to advance, by freeing my imagination from sensuality\r\nand my heart from coldness. God give me grace to persist. I lay\r\ngreat stress on trying by every means to impress in my mind a\r\nconstant sense of God’s presence.\r\n\r\n_March 8._—At Wilberforce’s last night till 10 o’clock, and was not\r\nin bed till quarter past 11 P.M. Though I was up before 4 A.M., and\r\nhad no sleep in the day, or very little, the consequence was that in\r\nthe night just past I slept very soundly indeed, and till 6 A.M.\r\nDean Milner[212] there, and I had much conversation with him about\r\nW. while he and Mr. W. were out of the room. He first made an\r\nimpression on Wilberforce’s mind at Scarborough; he hinted on some\r\nperson named being an enthusiast, but Milner (though not religious\r\nthen himself) checked it with a firmness that made W. think. They\r\nafterwards travelled to Nice, and were there three months about the\r\nyear 1783 or 1784. The Duke of Gloucester was then an infidel; the\r\nconversation M. had with him upon the journey had no other effect\r\n(indeed that was the capital one) but of making him serious in\r\nreading and considering the Bible, which he did with great industry\r\nand deep attention, bringing to it a _heart_ open to conviction; his\r\nhealth was injured by application, but his eternal soul was saved.\r\nHe afterwards broke off his intimacies with a social fashionable\r\nset, and particularly from dinners which hurt his progress in Divine\r\nimpersonation. He fairly and openly told his friends the reason.\r\nPitt never joked or laughed at him—some did, but he never; all were\r\nsorry to lose him. But he was in earnest, and carried his\r\ndetermination into effect to give himself wholly to the care of his\r\nsoul in the first place, and next to perform his temporal duties by\r\nassiduity in business. The Dean remarked the great good his book is\r\nlikely to do from this time to the end of the world. Many, many may\r\nbe saved by it. He dictated an answer to some quotations from David\r\nwhich the Duke of Grafton gave me the other day in argument against\r\noriginal sin, the righteousness named 1,000 years before Christ. He\r\nreplied as I had done on the spot to the Duke, that these men had\r\nthe _spirit_, and then were righteous before God in _Jesus Christ_\r\nwho saved from the creation.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Bedford’s death! How much I could write on that topic. I\r\nmet Halifax at the Duke of Grafton’s. He died with what is called\r\nperfect courage, collectedness, and resolution that is perfectly\r\nhardened in insensibility. A most tremendous, awful, horrible case!\r\nBut very difficult to separate affection for the amiable temper and\r\nuseful life from a just condemnation of his utter want of religion\r\nand piety.\r\n\r\n                   _From the Duke of Bedford[213]\r\n           in carrying out the plans of his late Brother_\r\n\r\n                                      ‘Woburn Abbey: March 28, 1802.\r\n\r\n  ‘Sir,—The sudden and fatal event which deprived me of one of the\r\n  kindest of friends and most affectionate of brothers, Agriculture\r\n  of one of its firmest props, and Society of one of its best and\r\n  most useful members, coming upon me too so soon after a former\r\n  severe domestic calamity, left my mind in such a state of sad\r\n  dejection as to render me wholly incapable of writing to you on a\r\n  subject deeply interesting to me, because it occupied the last\r\n  thoughts of my much lamented brother. His zeal for that first and\r\n  most interesting of pursuits, Agriculture, did not forsake him\r\n  even in the last moments of his life, and on his death-bed, with\r\n  an earnestness of mind expressive of his character, and with that\r\n  anxious consideration for the interests of his country which\r\n  occupied so many years of his well-spent life, he strongly urged\r\n  me to follow up those plans of national improvement which he had\r\n  begun, and from which he had formed the most sanguine hopes of\r\n  success. He referred me to Mr. Cartwright and to you for\r\n  explanations and details; with Mr. C. I have already had some\r\n  conversation, and hope soon to have the pleasure of seeing you. I\r\n  shall be in London in a day or two, and if you will favour me with\r\n  a line in Arlington Street, to name the day and hour most\r\n  convenient to you to call upon me, you will much oblige me. Should\r\n  you be absent from Town I trust it will not be long before I have\r\n  the satisfaction of seeing you at Woburn.\r\n\r\n  ‘Desirous as I am in every point of view to fulfil the last wishes\r\n  of my departed brother, I feel that my humble efforts must be at\r\n  such a vast distance from the exertions of his well-regulated and\r\n  superior mind, that without the aid and advice of those most\r\n  capable of assisting me, I should utterly despair of attaining the\r\n  objects now so near to my heart.\r\n\r\n                      ‘I am, Sir,\r\n                              ‘Your faithful and obedient servant,\r\n                                                          ‘BEDFORD.’\r\n\r\n                             _My Reply_\r\n\r\n                                   ‘32 Sackville Street: March 1802.\r\n\r\n  ‘My Lord,—The melancholy event which has deprived your Grace of a\r\n  brother so beloved was a stroke that affected every feeling of my\r\n  heart; others more habituated to his merit on great occasions\r\n  better knew than it was possible for me to do the powers of a mind\r\n  that could fathom the most important subjects; but to me, sinking\r\n  his great consequence in the country, he was a kind, most amiable,\r\n  and indulgent friend, nor shall I ever cease to lament the loss of\r\n  the best temper I ever met with; good humour seemed to spring from\r\n  a perennial source in his bosom. Pleasing and happy it is for his\r\n  lamented memory that all ranks and classes of the people have vied\r\n  in the expressions of grief for the loss of so able, sincere, and\r\n  unquestionable a patriot. It pleased him on several late occasions\r\n  to converse with me on his plans of those establishments he\r\n  meditated to connect with the employment of Mr. Cartwright.\r\n  Probably that gentleman has explained all or most of them to your\r\n  Grace. I shall be most happy to repeat them, and I am sure I need\r\n  not add that veneration for the memory of one who commanded the\r\n  regrets of a great nation, as well as the respect I owe to your\r\n  Grace’s character, will induce me most willingly to give you the\r\n  little assistance that is in my power to lessen the loss we have\r\n  all suffered.\r\n\r\n  ‘I rejoice in hearing of your Grace’s determination to tread in\r\n  those steps which proved so direct a path to a well-earned and\r\n  most useful fame.\r\n\r\n  ‘From eleven o’clock to-day till four, and from twelve till three\r\n  on Thursday, I am engaged with the Board, but will wait on your\r\n  Grace at any other time you are pleased to appoint.\r\n\r\n                ‘I am, my Lord,\r\n                           ‘Most respectfully your Grace’s\r\n                              ‘Much obliged and most humble servant,\r\n                                                  ‘ARTHUR YOUNG.’\r\n\r\nThe Board has been busy in voting testimonies to the memory of the\r\nDuke of Bedford, a race who should express most strongly their\r\nveneration. The Bishop of Llandaff brought a dedication for the\r\nvolume now ready—a medal ordered and a bust. These people are carnal\r\nand worldly, except, however, Mr. Wilberforce, who much promoted it,\r\nand spoke often in favour of it. His example is authority, or I\r\nshould have considered the whole as a worldly-minded business, and\r\nbad. This Duke, with vast powers and immense influence, set an\r\nexample to a town and populous neighbourhood in the country, and to\r\na great circle of friends and dependents, of an utter neglect, if\r\nnot contempt, of religion: all was worldly in his views; all his\r\nmotives tending that way, and his example mischievous to religion\r\nand the souls of men. All this praise and veneration is therefore\r\nvery questionable, and, I think, unlawful; it is looking at objects\r\nand judging of things with the herd, and therefore wrong; we cannot\r\ngo with them but to do mischief. Of what consequence is religion to\r\nthe world if farming and beneficence and good temper, and a life\r\nhighly useful in a worldly view, is to outweigh the evils of\r\nirreligion, and so very bad an example in morals and want of piety?\r\nI cannot approve of it, much as I liked the man in all worldly\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nDr. Pearson talking of experiments observed that contrary\r\nexperiments to good ones are nothing. ‘I can get evidence for or\r\nagainst anything: for the existence of angels and devils,’ &c. He is\r\na great infidel, one of the gang of philosophers of the Royal\r\nSociety, whose head, Sir J. B., is of the same mould, and whose\r\ninfluence is all on the same side, and does much mischief. The\r\ngreat, the wise, and the learned in this town, I fear, are nineteen\r\nin twenty infidels. Shocking! dreadful to think of!!\r\n\r\nDined at the Duke of Grafton’s, Menil the Nimrod and Dr. Halifax\r\nthere. I never fail to combat his Unitarianism, but do no good; yet\r\nhis arguments are weak as water.\r\n\r\n_20th._—At the Farmers’ Club. Carried with some difficulty a premium\r\nof fifty guineas for the best plough; several voted against it,\r\nbecause impossible to decide which of several should be the best!\r\nThese folks can hardly know the right end of a plough.\r\n\r\n_25th._—Dined at the Bishop of Durham’s; Price, the\r\nVice-Chamberlain, there, and Mr. and Mrs. Bernard. I would have some\r\nserious talk, and therefore asked the Bishop if he had read\r\nOverton’s[214] book? He had, and highly approved it. He met with it\r\nat York, and asked the Archbishop if he knew anything of the author,\r\nand, to his surprise, found that he did not even know there was such\r\na man, and knew nothing of him. The Bishop promised to send me his\r\ntwo charges and letters to the Deists. He was lately in company with\r\nOtto,[215] and made enquiries what that minister conceived would be\r\nthe result of the present order of things in France relative to\r\nreligion. Otto thought that it would end in the establishment of\r\nProtestantism;[216] this is remarkable and not improbable. The\r\nConcordat will not be executed. I questioned the Bishop about Paley:\r\n‘Mr. Y., I gave Dr. P. a living of 1,100_l._ a year for two great\r\nworks, the “Horæ Paulinæ” and “The Evidences,” and so I told him:\r\n“But, Dr. P., as to your Moral Philosophy I disapprove of it, and\r\ntherefore do not mistake my motive”’!! He is engaged in a work now\r\nat press on natural religion by the Bishop’s recommendation.\r\n\r\n_27th._—Our third volume Part I. of the ‘Communications’ is out, but\r\nI have yet heard nothing of the public opinion. The mere printing\r\nthis thin quarto has been the whole business of the Board, that is,\r\nof the President, from last November; nothing else done of any sort\r\nor kind. This is pitiable. He corrected the proofs and made them\r\ndance up and down to Wycombe, and wait as if time was of no\r\nconsequence, and a whole Session will pass with this for its only\r\nemployment. My ‘Hertford’ is ready for printing, Pitt’s ‘Leicester,’\r\nHowlett’s ‘Essex,’ and Plymley’s ‘Salop,’ and all at a stand; not\r\none proof of the second part of the ‘Essays’ at press in a\r\nfortnight, and nothing else thought of. He is as fit to be President\r\nof the Board as Grand Llama of Thibet; such is the way that all\r\npublic business is conducted. If I saw as much of the Treasury, have\r\nno doubt but similar though not equal neglect would appear. But what\r\na table of cyphers to meet week after week and urge nothing to\r\nsatisfy the public. The whole of this flows from the most fastidious\r\ncoxcombical pretension to purity of language: the time is spent in\r\nmaking phrases, as the French express it, which ought to be employed\r\nin devising and executing plans of improvement and pushing on the\r\ncounty surveys. Lamentable! A fine folly, however, has taken place;\r\nthe President and two other members went to see Salisbury’s\r\nbotanical garden—there he agreed to hire six acres at rent and taxes\r\n14_l._ an acre for Board experiments 1½ miles from Hyde Park Corner.\r\nI was not consulted, and 60_l._ paid for a lease before I knew a\r\nword of the matter; then I was ordered to view it, which I did, but\r\nno opinion asked. Next I was directed to draw up a plan of\r\nexperiments, which I did, without corn, for myriads of sparrows from\r\nnurseries would eat all up. These were partly accepted and partly\r\nrejected, and potatoes scouted because _people are sick of the name\r\nof potatoes_. ‘Suppose another famine, my Lord, what will those\r\npersons then think who are now sick of potatoes?’\r\n\r\nIt stands over for the Board. The whole idea is stark, staring\r\nfolly; it will cost 250_l._ a year, and the harvest well deserved\r\nridicule.\r\n\r\n_April 11._—Last Wednesday, Lord Carrington took me into his room\r\nand told me that his brother having the loan, he had spoken to him\r\nto write me down for 500_l._; and that the rise having been 4 per\r\ncent. he had directed it to be sold, and it would produce me 200_l._\r\nclear of charges. I thanked him much. Such a thing never entered my\r\nthoughts, and consequently surprised me much. It was very kind and\r\nconsiderate, and I am certainly much obliged to him for it. Next\r\nevening he sent for me, and gave me a draft on Smith and Payne,\r\n221_l._ 17_s._ 6_d._, for the rise was 4½ per cent. I was thankful\r\nto God for this, and meditated much on it. If God had not been\r\nwilling it would not have entered his head, and I find it\r\ncomfortable to attribute everything to God, as, indeed, everything\r\nought certainly to be attributed, and the more we trust entirely to\r\nHim the better I am persuaded it is for us. This is the first\r\nlottery for many years that I have been out of, but meeting with a\r\npassage in some of Scott’s things against lotteries I would not put\r\nin, or have anything to do with it. If God pleases to give me money\r\nHe has a thousand ways of doing it, and in these reflections I have\r\nhad hard work to guard my mind against the temptation to consider it\r\nin the light of a reward which would be vile where there is no\r\nmerit, no desert. I offend too daily and hourly to deserve anything\r\nbut wrath at His hands, and this I cannot dwell on too much or too\r\ndeeply. But for two years past of His infinite goodness He has made\r\nall money matters very favourable to me, and I thank Him for an\r\nuninterrupted stream of His bounty without let or hindrance, and\r\nthis notwithstanding my sensual mind and many offences. I cannot be\r\ntoo grateful for so much goodness, and I pray Him to give me grace\r\nto be kind and charitable to others while He is so good to me. I\r\nthink of these things with fear and trembling, lest they should\r\nthrow my mind and conduct into an improper train.\r\n\r\nOf late I have been ruminating on a short publication against the\r\nDeists, to consist merely of an attack on them to show the\r\ndifficulties and absurdities of their system; it will consist\r\nchiefly of extracts. I have read Bogue,[217] and Fuller and\r\nBerkeley’s[218] ‘Minute Philosopher,’ and Leslie,[219] but none of\r\nthem come up to my idea. It should be unmixed with a defence of\r\nChristianity, which should come in by way of appendix. I cannot get\r\nit out of my head, and shall certainly attempt it; the worst is I\r\nmust read their works (_i.e._ of the Deists, &c.), which is bad, but\r\nI shall not do it without prayer to God to fortify me against their\r\nsophistries and delusions.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning I hoped and expected to leave London, but Lord\r\nPelham, Secretary of State, has sent us the returns of acres cropped\r\nlast year from the clergy of the Kingdom, and so a Committee to-day,\r\nand to-morrow Good Friday; for Saturday I have taken places. Thus,\r\nafter twelve weeks in London, I lose four days. Very unlucky, and\r\nvery disagreeable, and for such nonsense as disgraces common sense.\r\nHe wrote a circular letter to all the clergy of the Kingdom last\r\nJune for this purpose, and from 10,000 parishes received accounts\r\nfrom about a half. Precious ones, to be sure! A very probable matter\r\nthat the farmers would give the number of acres sown with every sort\r\nof grain to the parsons; such attempts degrade Government in the\r\neyes of the people. What opinion can they have of men’s abilities\r\nwho expect thus to gain such facts?\r\n\r\nI was in danger of returning to London without one entry in this\r\nJournal, but going up to wipe my dear Bobbin’s book has thrown my\r\nmind into a fit of melancholy that I know not how easily to get rid\r\nof; yet will it go too soon? I have been whitewashing the house,\r\ncleaning about it, and keeping all things in pretty good order to do\r\njustice to the place as well as I am able; but my dear child’s\r\nrecollection brings forcibly to my heart the impression that it is\r\nthe will of God I should have hardly any chance of this prosperity\r\nbeing kept in my family. My son has no children, nor likely to have\r\nany. Mary, no chance of marrying, so that my posterity ends with the\r\nnext generation. The will of God be done, but human vanity and\r\nfeelings will rise in the bosom, and they cannot rise without these\r\nunpleasant ideas forcing themselves into my mind. Bradfield has been\r\nours 200 years, and I should have liked that my name and family\r\nmight here have continued. But God has punished me for my sins; I\r\ncan have nothing at His hands that I do not deserve. Blessed be His\r\nholy Name, be it my endeavour to submit to His will with resignation\r\nand cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nBetsy and O. dined with me on Tuesday, but the day so bad I could\r\nnot show her the round garden, which was got in very neat order. I\r\nhave had a letter from the Duke of Liancourt in which he speaks of\r\ncoming to England. I wrote to advise him against it, for he would, I\r\nfear, be very ill received. The Duke of Grafton read me a letter\r\nexpressed in most indignant terms on the passage relative to him and\r\nhis family in Mons. de Liancourt’s travels.[220] The new Duke of\r\nBedford writes to desire me, in very kind terms, to go to the Woburn\r\nsheep-shearing; asks it as a sort of favour. I had some very fine\r\ndays on coming down, but of late the weather has been cold, damp,\r\nand melancholy, but I never come without wishing to live here\r\nconstantly. I cannot help wishing it, but I hope without\r\ndiscontent—that would be black ingratitude to God. He fixes me where\r\nI am; all, all things I am well persuaded come from His Almighty\r\nhand, and therefore a cheerful submission is one great article of a\r\nreligious life. I brought down linen for the poor, but the number\r\nthat want, and I cannot relieve, is melancholy: I think I have fixed\r\nstraw work here, for above twenty-five have learned, and my\r\nsplitting machines are all distributed. Some days since I sent off\r\nto Dunstable the first product of their work, and hope I shall have\r\na good sale for the poor children.\r\n\r\n_June 1: London._—I keep this Journal as I do everything else, lest\r\ngood purposes be turned aside by trifles and want of resolution.\r\nThis is the thanksgiving-day; and last night was the Union\r\nmasquerade, and the coaches are now (5 A.M. in the morning)\r\nrattling, and one fool in some monkey dress has walked by my\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nA letter from the Duke of Bedford asking me to go to Woburn, which I\r\nshall do, and then I hope to Holkham, where Mr. Coke will take me in\r\nhis coach——and there I am on my ground for the survey of Norfolk;\r\nbut it is not yet decided whether I am to do it. It is a duty I owe\r\nto God to use the vacation in the best manner I can, but I can ill\r\nafford to travel at my own expense, determined as I am, if possible,\r\nto pay 700_l._ of debts.\r\n\r\nI should like to make a long journey in enquiries concerning the\r\npoor; I know not what would be best, and have prayed to God to guide\r\nme, but I am utterly displeased with myself in my religious\r\npursuits. My mind is sensual, and my progress slow; may the mercy of\r\nthe Almighty be shed on me in grace to mend. I have planned a new\r\nwork, ‘Deism Delineated,’ and made some progress, but do not please\r\nmyself. It must be done gradually as I read, and my time is fully\r\noccupied with many pursuits.\r\n\r\nPost to Chesterford, and having received a letter from the present\r\nDuke of Bedford requesting me to meet Lord Somerville and Mr. Coke\r\nat Woburn in order to consult upon the best means of carrying the\r\nlate Duke’s intentions into execution, especially in relation to the\r\nsheep-shearing, I set off accordingly, and got to Woburn at night,\r\nwhere I found Lord Somerville and Mr. Coke, and we considered the\r\nmatter as well as the late Duke’s proposals to breeders. At the\r\nmeeting the Duke’s attention was very pleasing, for he had great\r\nsolicitude to arrange everything down to the minutest trifles in\r\nexactly the same manner as his brother had done on former occasions.\r\n\r\nBefore dinner, the first day, he came up to me and said, ‘Mr. Y., I\r\nbeg you will take your old seat, and preside at one end of the\r\ntable, for which purpose I have ordered a servant to keep your\r\nchair.’ Everyone remarked the extreme attention of the duke that all\r\nthe business of the meeting should be well conducted.\r\n\r\n_12th._—Heartily tired of London, and the scenes I have endured at\r\nhome. I left town, and took Betsy’s new chaise, which I had bought\r\nfor her (170 guineas) for Chesterfield, where her whole family were.\r\nIt was a hurrying day.\r\n\r\nNext morning, Sunday, to church, and in the afternoon, contrary to\r\nmany feelings, to Baldock. No post-chaise to be had, so went on in\r\nmy whisky to Shefford, then post to Woburn by particular desire of\r\nthe Duke of Bedford, to concert matters with Lord Somerville and Mr.\r\nCoke for the shearing business. It was 11 P.M. at night before I\r\narrived; nobody there except they and Cartwright.\r\n\r\nOn the Thursday, with Mr. Coke and Mr. Talbot, in Coke’s chaise to\r\nBrandon, and on Friday morning to Holkham.\r\n\r\nFarmed on Saturday and too much on Sunday, so here have been two\r\nLord’s days profaned. How difficult it is to be in the world and\r\npreserve oneself uncontaminated by common practices! At church,\r\nhowever, in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe sheep-shearing the four following days, at which I had never\r\nbeen before. He does it handsomely; 200 dined on plate.\r\n\r\nThe dinner better than at Woburn, I think from vicinity to the sea,\r\nwhich gives plenty of fish.\r\n\r\nAt the Holkham meeting, had I entertained my former feelings of\r\npride and discontent, I should not have been too well pleased, for\r\nMr. C. was personally civil and attentive; and yet he took not the\r\nsmallest public opportunity of mentioning me, the Board, my report,\r\nor anything about it, though the occasion certainly called in reason\r\nfor it. Once this would have mortified me, but now I value such\r\nmatters not a straw. May God permit me to do my duty to Him, and as\r\nto what men think of me, I regard it less than the idle wind. I went\r\nto bed every night directly after coffee, between 9 and 10 P.M., and\r\nwas up between 3 and 4 A.M.\r\n\r\n[In London] at Mrs. Montagu’s.—Sir Sidney not there; Ryder, the\r\nPrivy Councillor, and his brother and Montagu, had been at Paris,\r\nand we had little conversation except on Bonaparte, &c. They\r\ncontended that every scrap of land is cultivated and much that was\r\nwaste. Sir F. combated the idea, and urged reports of prefects,\r\nspeeches, &c., as proving rents sunk, price of land fallen, produce\r\nas four to six, population lessened, and the price of labour risen,\r\n&c. &c. The last no proof of decline.\r\n\r\nRyder, on corn, observed that the same fact of wheat being dearer in\r\npeace than in war is found in the French prices annexed to\r\nArnold.[221]\r\n\r\nThey would not be introduced to Bonaparte. Fox had much conversation\r\nwith him, and he plainly urged the fact that Wyndham was concerned\r\nin the infernal machine, asserting that he had the proof. Sir F.\r\nsays that this proof was one George, being much with W., and\r\nafterwards going on the expedition to Quiberon. A party was taken\r\namongst whose papers (on the arrests for the infernal machine) were\r\nletters on that conspiracy to or from George, which combination was\r\nBonaparte’s _proof_. The Government, [he says, is] the completest\r\nmilitary despotism that ever was in the world.\r\n\r\nAt the theatre some Frenchmen finding Montagu was English, spoke\r\nmuch of me; and said they wanted of all things that I should come\r\nand examine France a second time under the new _régime_.\r\n\r\nDined with Swirenove, the Russian chaplain of the embassy, greatly\r\nemployed by the nobility of that Empire in agricultural commissions.\r\nPatterson, bailiff to Lord Hardwicke, is going to Russia, and left\r\nme to make a bargain for him, which I did. He is to have 100 guineas\r\nfirst year, and increasing 20 yearly till 200 guineas; 60 for his\r\nson-in-law, and 20 for his daughter, and 25 for a ploughman. Count\r\nRostopchin, at Woronowo, near Moscow, who has an immense estate, is\r\nthe man. A Russian count there, Benwakin, I think, [he named] whose\r\npeasants pay him 30 roubles a year; but paper money so multiplied\r\nand at 50 per cent. discount, that all prices are greatly risen\r\nnominally. The Emperor’s going to farm so largely has already had a\r\ngreat effect in turning the attention of the nobility to it. My\r\nannuity yesterday remitted from Ireland, 72_l._[222] Thank God for\r\nthat uninterrupted stream of His bounty which I have enjoyed of late\r\nyears without let or hindrance, and which my vile ingratitude\r\nreturns so badly.\r\n\r\nLord Winchilsea called yesterday, and sat an hour with me. He is, I\r\nbelieve, one of the very best of the nobility, and a really\r\nrespectable moral character, and benevolent to the poor.\r\n\r\n_August 22: Bradfield._—Here is a blank of many weeks, which shows\r\nonce more how difficult it is to keep journal resolutions. After a\r\nlong tour in Norfolk, which would have afforded much pleasure had\r\nnot business occupied all my time, I met Betsy and O. at Harleston,\r\non the 9th.\r\n\r\nWar much talked of. The militia calling out. These things, whatever\r\nthe event, are certainly God’s providences. His will be done. But\r\nwhen I consider the almost universal vice and iniquity of the\r\nkingdom, the amazing protection and blessings which have been\r\nshowered down on us, and the vile ingratitude to God which pervades\r\nall ranks in an utter forgetfulness of Him, or contempt of His\r\njudgments, I must own I tremble at the thought.\r\n\r\nI have lived some time without making a will, which has been very\r\nwrong. I am under such complex settlements that I do not understand\r\nwhat power I have; and Gotobed’s draft was so full of law jargon,\r\nthat I understand nothing of it. I wait no longer, but have made one\r\nplain and simple, and such as I hope, with the blessing of God, will\r\nnot nor can be misunderstood. I have disposed of what I have to the\r\nbest of my conscience, that is, if I was to die at Christmas. Here\r\nis only 300_l._ to be made up by sale of timber, ‘Annals,’ &c. &c.,\r\nbut a farm auction would produce more than 900_l._, and rents are\r\nalways behind, some over due. I pray to God for better economy, and\r\nmuch hope, by a fresh and careful attention to my farm and ‘Annals,’\r\nto bring things speedily to a better account.\r\n\r\nI forgot 100_l._ due to me from the Board for Norfolk Report, so\r\nthat I evidently leave enough for all demands, probably without\r\ncutting any timber.\r\n\r\nI have never lived so well with Mrs. Young as for five weeks past.\r\n\r\nWar! To look into futurity is idle. The event is in the Lord’s hand,\r\nand will depend on the number and piety of true Christians amongst\r\nus, and not be governed by fleets and armies. France is so\r\nunprepared at sea, that no war ever opened in that respect with\r\nbetter prospects. But this is the arm of flesh, and may mark the\r\nvanity of all trust in such circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe following letter to A. Y. may fitly close the chronicle of this\r\nyear:\r\n\r\n                                          ‘Drinkstone: Dec. 8, 1803.\r\n\r\n  ‘Sir,—A letter from Lord Euston to Sir Charles Davers recommends\r\n  that in case of invasion all horses and draft cattle that cannot\r\n  be driven out of the reach of the enemy be shot; and that all the\r\n  axle-trees or wheels of all carriages likely to fall into the\r\n  enemy’s hands be broken, the fullest assurance being given of\r\n  complete indemnification, provided no horses, draft cattle, or\r\n  carriages of any description fall into their hands through\r\n  negligence or want of proper exertion on the part of the owners.\r\n\r\n  ‘All other stock is to be left for the use of the troops, unless\r\n  there be evident danger it may fall into the invader’s hands, in\r\n  which case the measures formerly determined upon must be resorted\r\n  to.\r\n\r\n                     ‘I am, Sir,\r\n                                 ‘Your obedient humble servant,\r\n                                                    ‘JOSHUA GRIGBY.’\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 200:\r\n\r\n  _The Elements of Agriculture._\r\n\r\nFootnote 201:\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Oakes, _née_ Betsy Plampin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 202:\r\n\r\n  _A Collection of Theological Tracts_, by the Bishop of Llandaff, 6\r\n  vols.\r\n\r\nFootnote 203:\r\n\r\n  This seems to have been an anticipation of table-turning.\r\n\r\nFootnote 204:\r\n\r\n  Samuel Horsley, born 1733, died 1806, Bishop of St. Asaph’s, St.\r\n  David’s, and Rochester; celebrated for his controversy with Dr.\r\n  Priestley.\r\n\r\nFootnote 205:\r\n\r\n  The _Anti-Jacobin_, or _Weekly Examiner_, was started by Canning,\r\n  J.

See the following note from the\r\n  _Daily News_ Paris correspondent three or four years ago:\r\n\r\n  ‘An account of Napoleon I.’s visit to Breda in 1810 is now\r\n  appearing, for the first time, in the _Débats_, and is deeply\r\n  interesting. It will be seen that Napoleon I. at the zenith of his\r\n  power was on the point of becoming a Protestant.\r\n\r\n  ‘The Emperor, after receiving several Deputies, went up to the\r\n  Catholic Vicar, who had written a speech, and proceeded to read\r\n  it. The Emperor, without replying, asked where were the Protestant\r\n  ministers. Then M. Ten Oever, in his robes, followed by the entire\r\n  Protestant clergy, was presented by the Prince de Wagram, and read\r\n  an address. The Emperor remarked with satisfaction that the\r\n  Protestant ministers wore their robes. Then, turning to the Roman\r\n  Catholic clergy, he asked, “How is it that you are not wearing\r\n  your frocks? What! I come to a Department [Holland had been\r\n  annexed to France] where the majority are Catholics, who were\r\n  formerly oppressed, and who have received more liberty from the\r\n  King, my brother, and myself, and your first act is to show me\r\n  disrespect! I have always found my Protestants faithful subjects.\r\n  I have six thousand at Paris and eight hundred thousand in my\r\n  empire, and I have no cause for complaint against a single one.\r\n  Fools that you are! _If the Concordat had not been accepted by the\r\n  Pope, I should have turned Protestant, and thirty million\r\n  Frenchmen would have followed my example._ [The italics are my\r\n  own.] You have calumniated Protestants, representing them as men\r\n  teaching principles contrary to the rights of sovereigns. I have\r\n  no better subjects. They serve in my palace in Paris. It was not\r\n  Luther, nor Calvin, but the German princes who declined to submit\r\n  to your fanatical yoke. The English were quite right to part\r\n  company with you. You would like to set up scaffolds and stakes,\r\n  but I will prevent you. All authority comes from God.”’\r\n\r\nFootnote 217:\r\n\r\n  D.

Last night, for the first time in my life, I was at a\r\nreligious conversazione. Mr. Fry has it once a fortnight.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilberforce and thirty more, I suppose, began with singing a\r\nhymn, and then a prayer, and ended in the same manner; the subject\r\ndiscussed was Providence. Scott, Macaulay, and Fry were the only\r\nspeakers except myself, who threw in a word or two in a bad manner\r\nand not in unison; but I went without preparing the temper of my\r\nmind, and it proved to me a mere temptation to sin, as everything is\r\nsure to do when we trust in our own strength and do not pray for\r\ndivine assistance. I like the thing itself much, and the\r\nrecollection since it passed has produced in my mind a degree of\r\nhumiliation which might not have been in it had I not gone there. I\r\nwished to touch on the state of the King’s health, where the hand of\r\nGod is so evident; but they would attend only to little and private\r\nthings, and probably were right. They made every possible event, the\r\nmost trivial, providential. Scott is a predestinarian, but impresses\r\nthe necessity of attending to the _means_ by which God acts as much\r\nas if the divine decrees were not universal. The next subject is\r\nTemptation.\r\n\r\n_May 22._—My dear friend[223] at Bradfield writes me in a most\r\nmelancholy strain, on the ill success of her husband’s farming. I\r\ndoubt I shall lose largely by a scheme which was executed merely to\r\nkeep him out of greater mischief.\r\n\r\nThe new Bishop of Bristol is in dress and manners much like what we\r\ncall in Suffolk a leather breeches parson.\r\n\r\nSomebody called on Mrs. Pelham, and found her lying on a sofa\r\nreading a novel, rouged as much as any Madame la Marquise. They\r\nthought she seemed to be too high flown to be asked to a sober party\r\nof whist. What a gradation of evil amongst the worldly even in the\r\n_respectable_ (_soi-disant_) class.\r\n\r\nAn application from Phillips for another edition of the ‘Farmer’s\r\nCalendar.’ He printed 2,000 of the fifth, and 1,200 sold in a month;\r\nthey will all be gone before it can be reprinted. I had 100_l._ for\r\nthat edition, 40_l._ more for this six months after publication, and\r\nin future 25_l._ each succeeding one.\r\n\r\nHow grateful I ought to be, but am not, to God for a success which\r\nhas smoothed many difficulties, and enabled me much to lessen, in\r\nassistance to other circumstances, my debts. The sale is an\r\nextraordinary one.\r\n\r\nWhat would be with me the result of moral reflections and trust in\r\nhuman means, in the power of a vile heart to cure its own\r\niniquities? I have a conviction amounting to sensation in its truth,\r\nthat everything but looking unto Jesus is weaker than water—vain and\r\nfrivolous. This is the grand consideration, result, and object of\r\nreligion in the soul, all beside is wide of the mark and without\r\npower and efficacy. Oh, my God, my God! write these truths in my\r\nsoul, impress them in my heart, that by communion with Thee I may by\r\nThy grace be purified, washed, and cleansed from every evil thought.\r\nBlessed be Thy Holy Name for keeping me from _acts_ of sin. Oh! have\r\nmercy on my mind and take away every _thought_ of it.\r\n\r\nI shall have to experience another temptation, and should be\r\npreparing for it. I have little doubt but Lord Carrington will be\r\nagain President of the Board. He likes not me, and I shall be much\r\nmore uncomfortable than I have been with Lord Sheffield; but such\r\nchanges, if they happen, will be from the Lord, for nothing is so\r\nidle as for a Christian to suppose that anything takes place by\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to leave town till the Woburn meeting, but I am\r\nrestless, and want to get away. This is a common folly, and ought\r\ncarefully to be checked. It is the spirit that wastes half a life,\r\never looking to a future moment and never enjoying the present,\r\nwhich is that alone that is truly our own.[224]\r\n\r\nThere is not a more valuable lesson than to learn how to apply every\r\nportion of time to use, and not to suffer the expectation of, or\r\nwaiting for, any future moment to make the intermediate ones\r\ntiresome or unpleasant. It is wasting life and time that is never to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nYesterday, at 7 P.M., I dined with Mr. Anson—a farming party: Duke\r\nof Bedford, Earl of Galloway, Earl of Albemarle, Lord Somerville,\r\nSir Robert Lowley, Sir John Wrottesley, Mr. Coke, Mr. Motteaux, Mr.\r\nChild, Sir G. Pigot, Mr. Western, Mr. Wilbraham, all M.P.’s or in\r\nhigh life.\r\n\r\nNothing but a farming conversation makes the company of these people\r\nproper for me to have anything to do with; and that it is not to be\r\nconceived how little they know on the subject, considering it’s a\r\nfavourite pursuit. Such great fortunes and a life of luxury and\r\nbustle and motion are hostile to every kind of knowledge; and the\r\nconversation abounds with information for those who watch for and\r\nhave a memory to retain it, yet it demands a good deal of knowledge\r\npreviously digested and arranged to make a due use of it. A splendid\r\nhouse, one of the best in London; magnificent furniture, plate,\r\nservants, wines, and everything, equal to 30,000_l._ or 40,000_l._ a\r\nyear, but he has no such income.\r\n\r\nI have—I think I have—no envy of these doings. Such situations are\r\nso hostile to the religious principle that ought to animate the\r\nsoul, that I should think of them with fear and trembling. I hate\r\nparties, and my heart condemns me whenever I go to them, in which\r\nnot a word ever occurs to give God the glory due to His Holy Name,\r\nwhich is sometimes profaned but never honoured, where Grace before\r\nand after meat is discarded. And this is a sort of denial of Christ\r\nwhich gives me no slight disquiet and remorse, and ought entirely to\r\nbanish me from all such company; it works in me, and I cordially\r\nhope it will soon produce that effect, for the pleasure I receive is\r\nlittle and the offence to God I fear is much. ‘Come out from among\r\nthem and touch not the unclean thing,’ is applicable to more cases\r\nthan I have applied it to. I am determined to go only to Woburn this\r\nyear and not to Holkham; four days of noise and bustle are too much,\r\nI will get away in three; but a whole fortnight is horrible. I will\r\nget to Cambridge by Saturday, and I hope Jane will meet me there to\r\nspend Sunday, and perhaps Monday, with Simeon, and make him promise\r\nto meet Fry at Bradfield. Yesterday and this day hurry, bustle,\r\npacking up, paying bills, and recollection on the stretch lest\r\nanything should be forgotten. Wrote to Cordell, the bookseller, to\r\nsettle with me for the Irish Tour. It has been years out of print,\r\nand the last settlement in 1795. I have half the sale; 154 were then\r\nleft, my half, 30_l._ at least, and it never came into my head\r\nbefore. Very careless indeed, and in money to receive! Such busy\r\ndays are unpleasant because both mind and body are fatigued.\r\n\r\n_18th_ at Woburn. Came with Lord Sheffield yesterday. I detest this\r\nprofanation of the Sabbath, but he urged me so to accompany him that\r\nI yielded like a fool. A great dinner, Lords Albemarle, Ossory,\r\nLudlow, Duke of Manchester, Sir H. Fetherstone, Sir R. Pigot, the\r\nWilbrahams, &c., twenty in all. Several apartments newly furnished,\r\nand many very expensive articles, clocks, &c., from Paris to the\r\namount of 2,000_l._ Much done to the greenhouse, and everywhere a\r\nprofusion of expense. The late rains have given a fine verdure, and\r\nthe place in full beauty. Such a flow of worldly blessings as are\r\nseen in one of these very great residences makes me melancholy when\r\nI reflect on the immense temptation and dreadful responsibility that\r\nattaches. What have not these people to answer for if they forget\r\nthe Giver in the profusion of His gifts? and where am I to go to\r\nfind a great house and establishment with a society and conversation\r\nthat shows the Gospel of our Lord to be held in reverence and\r\naffection?\r\n\r\nThis poor Duke of Bedford, whose nominal income is so enormous,\r\nwill, I fear, involve himself with the same imprudence. Cartwright\r\nhas built him a steam engine (700_l._) for threshing and grinding:\r\n12 per cent. interest in the least to be calculated, or 84_l._, and\r\nyet a one-horse mill, price 50_l._, would thresh all the corn that\r\nwill ever be brought to this yard.\r\n\r\nAn extravagant duchess, Paris toys, a great farm, little economy,\r\nand immense debts, will prove a canker in all the rosebuds of his\r\ngarden of life. The providence of the Almighty governs all, and will\r\nnot permit an utter forgetfulness of Him to produce even the\r\ntemporal happiness which is alone sought for.\r\n\r\nI am tired of the whole, and long for the retirement and quiet of\r\nBradfield after so many weeks of London, and this finishing of hurry\r\nand bustle. I would not have another week of it for a hundred\r\npounds. What has a Christian to do with such scenes? How a person of\r\nfortune and the world can be one I know not. They are never cool,\r\nand have no time for reading or thought. It is madness to continue\r\nin such a state, but to travel 120 miles in order to enter a fresh\r\nscene of it, and perhaps within earshot of such a profane beast and\r\nfool as that Captain G. I sat near last year—this would be insanity.\r\nWhat a spectacle at Woburn was that miserably swearing profligate,\r\nMajor B., of Sussex, at the age of eighty-one, sticking to the last\r\nmoment to worldly dissipation, and utterly regardless of what is to\r\nbecome of him hereafter. Like Lord Lauderdale, who declared that he\r\nfeared nothing in this world nor in the next either! These people\r\ncall themselves Deists; I think they must be atheists, or they are\r\nutterly in contradiction to themselves. It is a sin, and ought to be\r\nrepented of, to go into such company. I feel myself here, looking on\r\nthe tranquil bosom of the Ouse, as having escaped from a\r\nmultiplicity of temptations, and that this is the first moment of my\r\nsummer holidays, quiet and alone. This morning I had a letter from\r\nJane, by which I find it is quite uncertain whether I shall meet her\r\nat Cambridge. She asks my directions, but had she thought, must have\r\nknown that she could not receive an answer in time. I hope to hear\r\nSimeon[225] twice on Sunday, and much wish that she may be there, as\r\nI wrote before to request it; and she says she should like it of all\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n_24th: Cambridge._—I dined here yesterday. Inquired for that great\r\nand good man, Simeon, but he was not to be in town till the evening.\r\nI walked behind Trinity and John’s, &c., twice—a delightful day.\r\nWrote and left a letter for him; at nine he came, and will certainly\r\nmeet Fry at Bradfield. Thank God! I shall hear him twice to-day and\r\nMr. Thomason once, for I shall go thrice to Trinity Church. I\r\nmentioned Fry’s calculation of three millions of Christians; but he\r\nvery properly thought it very erroneous. He thinks Cambridge a fair\r\naverage, and in 10,000 people knows but of 110 certainly vital\r\nChristians—more than 150 can scarcely be from a seventy-fifth to a\r\nhundredth part therefore! There are, I am rejoiced to hear it, many\r\nvery pious young men in the colleges.\r\n\r\n_Night._—I have been at Trinity Church thrice to-day. In the morning\r\na very good sermon by Simeon, a decent one by Thomason, and in the\r\nevening to a crowded congregation a superlative discourse by Simeon\r\non the twelfth verse of chapter iv. of the Acts: ‘There is no other\r\nname under heaven,’ &c. Vital, evangelical, powerful, and impressive\r\nin his animated manner.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, July 8: Bradfield._—This day se’nnight took the Sacrament\r\nwith Jane at Bury, suddenly, and therefore without any preparation,\r\nand got there in the Lessons. The week has been vile and miserable.\r\nFry cannot come, but had a letter from Simeon, he will be here\r\nto-morrow! O Lord, of Thy mercy give a blessing to his presence,\r\nthat conversation and prayer with him may give a turn to my mind!\r\nWere it not for what I think a firm faith in the Cross of my\r\nRedeemer, I should think that I was almost in the jaws of hell. But\r\nif I perish it shall be looking at the brazen serpent. Fiery\r\nserpents innumerable bite; let me turn instantly to the Cross, and\r\nthere see and trust to the blood of sprinkling. What should I have\r\nthought of this before my conversion? Is it true and saving faith\r\nnow to think and feel it—or rather to know it in my understanding\r\nthan feel it in my heart? I am full of apprehensions, and the only\r\nsign of spiritual life in me is some sense and feeling of my own\r\niniquity and the plague of my carnal thoughts; but if they were\r\ntruly a load to me, would not the Lord ease me of the burden?\r\n\r\n_10th._—Yesterday, Simeon came. His character singular. His\r\npiety—his strong expressions—his fervency in prayer—a powerful mind!\r\n\r\n_13th._—Simeon went this morning. I have been horribly negligent in\r\nnot writing down many of his conversations. What he thinks of me I\r\nknow not, but he spoke to Jane with great freedom and candour, and\r\nas became a good Christian.\r\n\r\nHis abilities are considerable, his parts strong, his ardour and\r\nanimation uncommonly great. His eloquence great, and his manner\r\nimpressive. His prayers admirably adapted to the cases of all who\r\nheard him. He came with a servant and two very fine horses, on which\r\nhe places a high value. From his life and expenses must have a\r\nconsiderable income; for his preferment is only expense, and costs\r\nhim more than he receives from it. His fellowship is as good as 400\r\nguineas a year to him. He must have a very good private fortune,\r\nfrom some circumstances, as I judge, which he dropped in\r\nconversation. He went to Cambridge from Eton and became a Christian\r\non the third day, now about twenty-five or twenty-six years ago.\r\nDuring all which time he has never doubted of his future salvation.\r\nHe is remarkably cheerful and has much wit, or something nearly\r\nallied to it.\r\n\r\nI wrote to N. H., requesting his pulpit for Sunday, but he refused\r\nit; and after church apologised, saying it was not from himself, but\r\nhe was _talked to_.\r\n\r\nOh! for the dumb dogs of our clergy who will neither preach the\r\nGospel themselves nor let others do it. I told him that my request\r\nwas to him a safe one, for I asked, of course, only for a\r\nregularly bred clergyman, and who possessed preferment in the\r\nnational church. Very unlucky! Symonds dined here, and his\r\nconversation never does any good. He explained his chance for\r\nsalvation in the merits alone of Jesus Christ, but denies original\r\nsin. This seems a contradiction; I would not think so for a\r\nthousand worlds! How can he be sensible of what he wants in the\r\nblood of the Saviour without knowing the utter depravity of his\r\nheart?\r\n\r\nTuesday morning, C. Coke, of Holkham, Allen, and Moore called on me\r\nto see the farm, and would have me dine with them at Moore’s. Haunch\r\nof venison, &c. Mrs. M. young, and in the worldly sphere very\r\nagreeable; her dress horrid. She contrives to force out her\r\nprominent bust in a manner that must take no small attention in\r\ndressing, is very big with child, and thinly clad; such a figure is\r\ncommon in these times, but the fashion is contrived purposely.\r\n\r\nMr. Smirenove came last night to dinner, and brought Count\r\nRostopchin’s snuff-box. It is turned in his own oak, lined with\r\ngold, and has a tablet containing the representation of a building\r\ndedicated to me. The inscription in Russian, _A Pupil to his\r\nMaster_, set round with sixty-six diamonds. Query—Should not all\r\nsuch toys be turned into money and given to the poor? He was Prime\r\nMinister under Paul, and has 50,000_l._ English per annum.\r\n\r\nOn Monday I breakfasted, dined, and slept at Lord Bristol’s; Lady B.\r\nand her sister, Miss Upton, sung Italian airs till twelve o’clock at\r\nnight. They were many years ago a horrible temptation, now [they\r\nare] a frivolous waste of time, but ever a bad tendency on the\r\nheart. Pressed me greatly to stay; but I was engaged next day to\r\ndinner at Gooch’s, and yesterday I dined at Betsy’s. All this\r\nvisiting is very bad for my soul.\r\n\r\nFriday I dined again at Lord Bristol’s, by desire of the Oakes, as\r\nthey expected meeting none they knew, but there were several. Music\r\nin the evening, slept there; in the morning, at Bury, met Benjafield\r\non justice business. He wanted to commit a woman for being a lewd\r\nwoman, on the statute of King James, by which it can only be for a\r\nyear; if this was executed, all the prisons in the county would not\r\nhold them, and the time is far too severe; nor do I conceive that\r\nthe case comes within it. I declined, and desired they might be\r\nheard on Wednesday, as appeared the week before. I go on in\r\nrepentance miserably, my heart is cold, and I am languid in\r\ndevotion. Oh, could I sufficiently hate and abhor myself!!\r\n\r\n_November 2._—If I go ten yards from home it can be only into the\r\nworld, and therefore I never move but for mischief. I have every\r\npost a packet of letters from Lord Sheffield, filling the tables and\r\nfor many hours employment every day. There seems to be no great\r\nreason for apprehending any famine, or even such a scarcity as\r\nbefore, but the price must be too high for the poor, without being\r\nhalf high enough for the farmer: I mean of wheat, the crop of which\r\nis full as bad as it has been for ten years past, but there is a\r\nstock in hand which will keep it down.\r\n\r\n_December 30._—I went to London on account of the Smithfield Club\r\nand there received the first Bedford medal of the Bath Society for\r\nan essay on the Nature and Properties of Manures, there being four\r\nother candidates. At London also I dined with M. de Novosilikoff, a\r\nparticular friend of the Emperor Alexander, who is here on a\r\npolitical mission of great importance.\r\n\r\nDavidson, who manages the Emperor’s farm, and Smirenove were\r\npresent; their plan at present is to have reports of their\r\nGovernments made upon the same system as ours, of counties, and Mr.\r\nde N. talked much of the great advantage of my going. I would not\r\noffer myself, but said that the whole would depend on the sort of\r\nmen employed. Since I came down I wrote to Smirenove, offering\r\nArthur (by his own desire), provided the sum granted for the purpose\r\nwas adequate.\r\n\r\nDe N. was out of town, so no answer yet.\r\n\r\nThe attention I give to all these worldly matters, though they do\r\nnot sit at all close to my heart, yet occupy too much of my time.\r\n\r\nI do not give enough to the far greater interests of the eternal\r\nworld; and I have been for months past, and am at present, in a\r\ndead, sinful state, remote from the only God of hope and\r\nconsolation.\r\n\r\nHis mercy to me is great, for I have life and health. I am not in\r\nhell; but I find a horrible difficulty in coming to God, and a\r\ndeadness of heart which hurts my prayers and plunges me more and\r\nmore in sin and offence.\r\n\r\nO Lord, of Thy mercy listen unto me. Oh! look with compassion on my\r\nwretchedness.\r\n\r\n_1805. Jan. 30._—The 19th I came to London; the 23rd breakfasted\r\nwith Mr. Novosilikoff, and made my proposals of terms on which\r\nArthur would go to Russia, having before received a letter from\r\nSmirenove announcing an entire approbation in Mr. N. of my son for\r\nthe expedition. The terms were that he and his wife should go by\r\nland, getting out hence the beginning of March, in order to be at\r\nMoscow the beginning of May; that is, if out a year he should have a\r\nthousand pounds, and proportionably for a longer time, and all his\r\nexpenses paid to, at, and from Russia. He came into it readily, and\r\nwhen the conversation was over, Mr. Davidson, who was present, said,\r\n‘Well, now it seems all settled, and it only remains to know where\r\nMr. Y. is to be supplied with money for his journey.’ Mr. de N. said\r\nMr. Smirenove would be directed to advance it.\r\n\r\nReflecting afterwards on this conversation, I thought that some\r\nadmission of the terms in writing should be obtained, as in case of\r\ndeaths or revolutions they might be questioned; I therefore wrote to\r\nMr. de N., recapitulating the terms on both sides and begging to\r\nknow if I was correct.\r\n\r\nNo answer was returned; but Lord Somerville, calling on me two days\r\nafter, mentioned in conversation that be had recommended a Mr.\r\nGreen, who had farmed in Normandy, and been seven years in a French\r\nprison, of which he had published an account, to Mr. de N. to go to\r\nRussia to survey a government, hinting at the same time his\r\nknowledge that my son was in contemplation also. He said that G. had\r\nbreakfasted with de N., who was much pleased with him.\r\n\r\nAll this awakens suspicions in my mind that, combined with the\r\nsilence of Mr. de N., make it apparently necessary to know how we\r\nreally stand, and I determined to write to Smirenove requesting that\r\nhe would speak to Mr. de N., as any uncertainty was unpleasant,\r\nwhile my son was actually arranging his farm, &c., for his\r\ndeparture. This I have now done, and shall send it before breakfast,\r\nfor no answer is yet come.\r\n\r\nI do not like the complexion of the business, but think it likely\r\nthat Green speaking French, which will save the necessity of Jane\r\ngoing as an interpreter, and perhaps his taking one or two hundreds\r\ninstead of 1,000_l._, may have induced de N. to think again of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nI have prayed earnestly to the Lord that He would prevent the\r\njourney taking place if it would turn out in any way injurious to\r\nthe state of their souls, putting the matter entirely in His\r\nAlmighty hands, and determining to rest assured that if it does not\r\ntake place, it will be the Lord’s will, and that I should be\r\nthankful for His interference to prevent it.\r\n\r\nThe government of Moscow which A. was to have done is thirteen times\r\nas big as Norfolk. It would take two years to do it well without any\r\ndoubt. A. is much disappointed, for he liked the thoughts of the\r\nscheme much.\r\n\r\nI threw out in conversation with N. that if the business of the\r\nBoard would permit, and they approved it, I would go over in June,\r\nand stay till November to assist in the work; that I should ask only\r\nmy expenses. He seemed much to approve of this, but it was mentioned\r\nonly as a contingency. Here the matter rests. I shall know soon what\r\nthe event will be.\r\n\r\nMany things have had a very lowering aspect of late, the ‘Annals’\r\nwith Phillips are certainly at an end. They do not answer with him,\r\nand he has demurred at settling the account, with 100_l._ or more\r\ndue to me. This will be a loss of 180_l._ a year. My plan is to\r\nprint four numbers a year on my own account, for the sake of selling\r\nold stock; by this I shall lose 40_l._ more. In Ar.’s (Arthur’s)\r\nfarm the rent will be sunk from last Michaelmas 20_l._ a year, and I\r\nam engaged to pay Noxford 20_l._ a year more tithe. This year the\r\nExchequer annuity of 150_l._ a year ceases.\r\n\r\nOn the whole here is full 400_l._ a year loss of income, which will\r\nbe very distressing if every expenditure be not pared down in a most\r\neconomical manner. May the Lord’s mercy give me grace to be steady\r\nand determined in this matter, for it is a most important one. I\r\nhave very little to suffer personally in the reduction, for the\r\nexpenses do not run that way, but comforts must be cheerfully\r\nlessened.\r\n\r\n_Feb. 3._—No answer came from Novosilikoff; I wrote therefore to\r\nSmirenove, who replied last Friday that N. was gone to St.\r\nPetersburg, that he had replied to my letter, and was surprised that\r\nI had not received it; that he approved of all the contents of mine,\r\nand had left orders with him to supply money.\r\n\r\nThis I despatched to A., who was become very uneasy and impatient.\r\nSo now the business seems concluded and the die cast, but may the\r\nLord prevent it taking place if it is to be productive of evil to\r\nthe eternal interests of either! I pray for this, may He hear my\r\nprayers. I have little notion of comfort in anything that is\r\nundertaken without consulting God, opening the business to Him, and\r\nbegging His direction how to proceed. I have had a letter from\r\nOrbell’s[226] friend, who agrees to my terms of letting Ar.’s farm,\r\nso, thank God, that is settled.\r\n\r\n_17th._—Many difficulties have occurred relative to a post-chaise\r\nfor them. Brown has examined my old one and sent an estimate of the\r\nrepairs, 56_l._ Smirenove approved of it, but his second advice is\r\nthat it would not do. He proposed one of his, and letters backwards\r\nand forwards. But yesterday I found one at Holmes’s in Long Acre,\r\nbuilt for a Mr. Lock to go to Malta, which will do exactly, and in\r\nwhich they may have bedding and sleep at full length; a journeyman\r\nsaid the price was 50 guineas. H. not at home, in the evening a\r\nletter, and 70 guineas named.\r\n\r\nI got up as always at 4 A.M., and have been reading and praying. Fry\r\nlast Sunday alluded to an apostate from the truth, and Wilberforce\r\nasked him who it was, saying that of course he would not answer if\r\nthe question was improper.\r\n\r\nIt was Townsend,[227] of Wiltshire, the traveller in Spain, who\r\nbegan his career quite in the style of Whitfield’s energy and\r\nopenness of declaring his principles in the fields or in barns, &c.\r\nThe Lansdown folks told him they could never make him a bishop with\r\nsuch conduct or such principles; upon which he dropped the whole,\r\ngiving out to his friends that he only suspended his conduct and\r\nmeant to resume it at a better season. That never came, and he has\r\ncontinued an apostate from all religion, and from having 200\r\ncommunicants at his church, has now only two or three besides\r\nhimself and his clerk.\r\n\r\nThis miserably constituted Board of Agriculture is ever in a dilemma\r\nwhen a new president is to be elected. Lord S. will keep it no\r\nlonger, and he is in a difficulty to propose another. He has written\r\nto the Duke of Bedford, and I fear in a way that may make the duke\r\nsuppose that Government approves of it. Lord Carrington I suspected\r\nintended to come in again, but he assures me that he would not.\r\n\r\n_March 3._—I borrowed of Mr. Wilberforce, Owen[228] on ‘Indwelling\r\nSin,’ to which are annexed two other essays on Temptation and the\r\nMortification of Sin in Believers. The last work is incomparable,\r\nchapter ix. of it perhaps the most useful paper ever written. I\r\nhave made many extracts from all three. The essay on Mortification\r\nI meditate printing a new edition of, being out of print, to which\r\nI could add notes that might be useful. The reading these\r\ntreatises has had an effect on my mind which I hope, with the\r\nblessing of the grace of God, will produce a more serious\r\nattention to the state of my heart with God than reading any book\r\nhas done since Wilberforce’s.\r\n\r\n_April 20._—At Bradfield. Yesterday returned from Harwich. Arthur\r\nand Jane went on board the ‘Diana’ packet, Capt. Stewart, Thursday,\r\nthe 18th, at 3 o’clock, and I have taken a long and melancholy\r\nfarewell of them! Oh! may Almighty God give His blessing to the\r\nundertaking, and that we may all meet again in health and happiness.\r\nBut when the fearful uncertainty of all earthly events is\r\nconsidered, such partings ought to be more melancholy than they are.\r\nShe felt much, and has a cordial affection for me.\r\n\r\nThe undertaking, thus employed by a foreign sovereign to make a\r\nreport of one of his provinces, is the first thing of the kind that\r\nhas occurred, and will either give Arthur a great reputation, or\r\nsink that which he has gained. It is a very difficult work, however,\r\nto produce a good book from a very ill-cultivated province, and in\r\nthe large experience of all our own reports we see that very few are\r\nwell executed; the object has either been ill understood or poorly\r\ndone, the surveyors deal in reflections instead of giving the\r\nexperience of individuals, yet the husbandry of a county is made up\r\nof nothing else but private exertions. They do not half travel\r\n[over] the districts, and do not take notes of the practice of one\r\nhundredth part of those persons that might be applied to. Arthur\r\ngoes with every possible advantage except languages, I hope he will\r\nexert them.\r\n\r\nBradfield is very melancholy without them. Jane was always cheerful,\r\nalways affectionate and kind to me, ever pleased with my presence,\r\nand never parted from me but with regret. The loss of such a friend\r\nwith much conversation and an excellent understanding nothing human\r\ncan make amends for. It is a loss that ought to turn all my\r\nattention and all my heart to that better world where parting,\r\nsorrow, and death will find no place.\r\n\r\n_24th._—Last night I slept at Bury, at the Oakes’, having walked\r\nthere in the morning and dined with them. It raised my low spirits a\r\nlittle—but badly—for such company is mere dissipation.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning, hankering after some sort of dissipation to\r\ndivert my melancholy, I fortunately recollected that Jane had left\r\nCowper’s Letters, and that I had not read the third volume. I got\r\nit, and beginning knew not how to lay the book out of my hand, and\r\nbefore night read the volume through. There is an uncommon charm in\r\nhis sentiments and his style; something that interests the heart\r\nwonderfully. The religious passages are peculiarly valuable, and a\r\nfew struck me very much.\r\n\r\nOn the Sabbath he is extremely just. On turning the mind from\r\ncreation’s beauties to creation’s Author, the observation is fine;\r\nhis remarks on the life of dissipation at Brighton, beautiful; on\r\nreligion, page 106, on local attachments, on familiar communion with\r\nGod, on natural music, terminated by a most sublime passage—‘There\r\nis somewhere in infinite space a world that does not roll within the\r\nprecincts of mercy; and as it is reasonable and even scriptural to\r\nsuppose that there is music in heaven, in those dismal regions\r\nperhaps the reverse of it is found. Tones so dismal as to make woe\r\nitself more insupportable, and to acuminate even despair!’ What a\r\nstriking thought! But how many are there that will believe in\r\nneither hell nor devil, and what must their belief and feelings be\r\nwho, closing their ears here, open them to the sounds of such a\r\nworld as that! How many passages do we meet with in great authors\r\nwhich seem sufficient to strike a reader’s mind to conviction and\r\nconversion; yet read by thousands, perhaps admired, without the\r\nsmallest effect on the heart.\r\n\r\n_25th._—A Mr. Cole called here to ask about passports for Russia. He\r\nhas hired 30,000 acres in the province of Minsk, which he is to have\r\nwith 300 boors, paying half the profits as rent. He was advised not\r\nto take a grant of land, as it would cause a difficulty after it to\r\nquit Russia. I must caution Arthur about this, for he may entangle\r\nhimself without being aware of it. In the melancholy, solitary\r\nmoments I pass here, I have been thinking of the many blessings the\r\nAlmighty has been graciously pleased to shower down upon me. First,\r\nHe gives me great health, at sixty-four, as good as at any time for\r\ntwenty years past, and much better than forty years ago. Secondly,\r\nHe has been pleased to leave me two children. Oh, that He would call\r\nthem to feel truly His faith, fear, and love! Thirdly, He has\r\ngranted me an ample income very far beyond what I had, upon entering\r\nthe world, the smallest reason to expect. I have many doubts of\r\nmoney ever being a blessing, but that is owing to the receiver and\r\nnot to the giver, it certainly is that which might be made by grace\r\na very considerable one. Fourthly, He has given me the power of\r\nbeing greatly useful to my country; it would be foolish not to\r\nreckon that which I know beyond the possibility of vanity deceiving\r\nme. Fifthly, He has given me a paternal estate and residence which I\r\ngreatly love and never wish to change. I could go on and reckon many\r\nother things, but these are sufficient to call for a heartfelt and\r\ndeeply abiding gratitude. I ought to be able to add, that I am\r\nmiserable for want of feeling this as I should do; in truth I am in\r\nthis respect a brute beast devoid of everything that marks the\r\nChristian and the penitent. O Lord, of Thy mercy soften this\r\nobdurate heart by the grace of Jesus Christ! Fill it with contrition\r\nfor offences. Purify and renew it, bring it in holy faith to the\r\nfoot of the Cross, and make it feel its iniquities, till it be\r\nchanged and impressed with Thy holy image.\r\n\r\n_26th._—I read the concluding entry of yesterday, and it struck me\r\nthat I had not thanked God for the friends He had given me, and this\r\nmade me muse for a while. Had I wrote before I became serious, how\r\nwarmly should I have thanked Him on this score! How it is with\r\nothers I know not, but with me religion has cooled, checked, or\r\nannihilated those feelings; real friendship cannot be felt by a\r\nChristian but to a Christian.\r\n\r\nWhat surprises me much more is that I do not feel any very\r\nstriking advantage from the society of Christians. This I\r\nattribute as a fault in myself, and dare say it is for want of\r\nmore grace and prayer. I love their company, and, some hankerings\r\napart, desire no other. I hope with God’s blessing to improve in\r\nthis respect—hitherto solitude has been my best friend. Here there\r\nare none to be acquainted with but a very few poor people who are\r\nnever at their ease with me; and at London those I know are too\r\nmuch engaged to see many more than for a moment. Going to bed at\r\nnine o’clock prevents the society I might otherwise have there if\r\nit were followed up.\r\n\r\n_28th._—Symonds slept here the night before last and dined twice,\r\nwhich obliged me to postpone more business than I otherwise should\r\nhave done. He told me one anecdote I had not heard before. In Lord\r\nBute’s administration, as his lordship told him himself, the King\r\nsettled with him to give the Royal Society 500_l._ a year for ever,\r\nwhich was accordingly communicated, and to Lord Bute’s amazement\r\nrefused. On enquiry he found that the motive was an apprehension\r\nthat he should become too popular if it was accepted! Was ever such\r\nfolly heard of?\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote of Symonds. He dined last year at Sir C. Bunbury’s,\r\nwhere he met the rich Mr. Mills, the brandy merchant, who bought\r\nMure’s estate, and who said he found my ‘Annals’ there, which were\r\ngood for nothing. ‘What, nothing good in them?’ said S. ‘No, nothing\r\nat all.’ ‘That is unfortunate with so many correspondents. But if\r\nthe “Annals” are bad, have you read Mr. Y.’s travels?’ ‘Yes, and\r\nvery poor stuff they are.’ ‘That is still more unfortunate, for I\r\nknow that the Marshal de Castries and the late King of Prussia spoke\r\nin the highest possible terms of them, and books in French by\r\nrespectable writers have been dedicated to Mr. Y. in consequence of\r\nthat publication.’ ‘I can see nothing in them.’\r\n\r\nThe next day he wrote Symonds a letter with many apologies, as he\r\nunderstood that he had been talking to a gentleman who had\r\ncontributed much to the ‘Annals.’\r\n\r\nSo much for my rich neighbour.\r\n\r\nLetters from London, and I am very sorry to find that my poor wife\r\nis much worse. Nothing but bad news. Sir J. Banks writes me that Sir\r\nJ. Sinclair is to resume the chair of the Board under promises of\r\ngood behaviour. My wife’s miserable state is a much worse business.\r\n\r\n_May 22._—I am entirely alone and not without melancholy. Worldly\r\npeople have a thousand resources, as I had once, but every atom of\r\nthem leads to mischief, and I am a thousand times better without\r\nthem. Lord Carrington the other day, speaking to Sir C. Willoughby\r\nabout his son going to school, said, ‘Oh, send him to a great one,\r\nwhich will give him a manly character fit for the world, make him a\r\nman of the world.’ So it is with these people; Jesus Christ tells us\r\nto hate the world, and that what is in high estimation amongst men\r\nis abomination in the eyes of God; but worldly men declare, and\r\nthink, and feel, and act, directly hostile to Scripture; they urge\r\none another and impress as respectable everything that God abhors.\r\nWords cannot express a character more in contradiction to the\r\nChristian than that which is meant by a _man of the world_.\r\n\r\n_23rd._—I was awake at 2 A.M. and laid without sleep till 3 A.M. My\r\nthoughts were not edifying, so I jumped out of bed, and having\r\nprayed to the Father of mercies, I began with business. But the\r\ntrain of thought I had been in came again and interrupted me; it was\r\nupon the event of what would befall me as secretary to the Board. I\r\nhave many reasons for thinking that several of the members do not\r\nlike me, and should anything happen that gave them any handle, would\r\nbe glad to get rid of me. This was not the case when I was one of\r\nthemselves, but they know that I associate with religious people, go\r\nto the Lock (a very black mark), and read the Bible, and now and\r\nthen words drop which I understand. Should Sir J. Sinclair become\r\npresident or Lord Carrington, they might make it very unpleasant to\r\nme. Sir John is as poor as a church mouse, and would like well to\r\nhave his lodging here. Should my family lessen, it would be quite\r\nunbearable, and if the idea was started, I must resist it, the\r\nquestion would probably be lost, and then I should resign; this\r\nwould fix me in repose at Bradfield, and I should be to the full as\r\nhappy as at present, but my family would not, and then—all this is\r\nvery wild. I will have done with it for so much as I am persuaded\r\nthat everything is in the hands of God; nothing can be greater folly\r\nthan pretending thus to look forward, it is equally useless and\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\n_June 3._—Since the last entry I have had letters from Jane and\r\nArthur at Berlin, where they seemed to have stayed a week. They had\r\nbeen received with great politeness and attention by the Princess of\r\nHolstein, Prince Baratinsky’s mother; had dined with her, and she\r\ncarried them to her villa; they had dined also with the English and\r\nRussian Ambassadors, and been at Charlottenburg with Sir G. Rumbold.\r\n\r\nI begin to be a little restless to get into the country.\r\n\r\n_15th._—Bradfield. I got here the 6th, earlier than ever before or\r\nsince the institution of the Board, which is a great blessing. I\r\nhave managed to escape both Woburn and Holkham.\r\n\r\nI have missed Jane terribly, but I have endeavoured to turn it to a\r\nreligious account. Poorly and weakly, but still better than not at\r\nall. The weather has been bad, which has caused my taking less\r\nexercise than is good for me, but blessed be God, my health is\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nI have stuck close to my great work the ‘Elements,’ and have gone\r\nthrough my own Norfolk report and the fourth volume of the Board\r\n‘Communications.’ What an immense labour has it been, and for how\r\nmany years to collect and arrange materials. I could not have\r\nconceived how much it is necessary to do before I can fairly say,\r\nNow all is before me and in order, ready to compare and draw\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nI mean it to contain everything good that has ever been printed.\r\nTill all that is collected and before me, how can I know what is\r\nalready done, and what wants to be added?\r\n\r\nBut the labour, when continued year after year, is what I never\r\ndreamt of when I began. I have worked hard at the first\r\ndivision—_Soils_, and brought it into some form; and it is a\r\nspecimen of how much attention every division will demand. I have\r\nalso began the second, on Vegetation. I fear making the work too\r\nvoluminous, and that by-and-by I must curtail greatly. Success is\r\npleasant, and I should fear that if it exceeded two large quartos.\r\n\r\nSince I have been here I have read a little work of Flavel’s,[229]\r\n‘A Saint indeed,’ which is truly admirable; some [passages] in\r\nMarshall[230] on ‘Sanctification,’ and very many of Cowper’s\r\nletters, all the religious ones.\r\n\r\n_18th._—Cowper is invaluable to a country gentleman that would enjoy\r\nhis residence without the world’s assistance. Reading his letters\r\nhas made me more attentive to every beauty of this place, of which I\r\nwas always so fond; there is something very amiable in the manner in\r\nwhich he converts every flower, tree, and twig to enjoyment, and I\r\nwalk out better prepared for this pleasure from the perusal of that\r\nmost agreeable writer. There is but one danger from which, poor man,\r\nhis poverty secured him, and that is the mind insensibly running\r\ninto speculation of improvement. I have made many here, and the\r\ntaste is very insatiable; this may without a guard lead to too much\r\nexpense. But I endeavour to correct the wanderings of imagination,\r\nand to dwell on the beauties of every single tree, shrub, and spot,\r\nand to be content with them all as they are. The laburnum in the\r\nback lawn is more beautiful than I ever saw it, so entirely covered\r\nwith rich clusters of its golden flowers, that I can admire it for\r\nan hour together. This enjoyment, however, is very poor and fading\r\nif we do not, with Cowper, tum our minds habitually to the great and\r\nbeneficent Author of all these beauties. This sentiment is\r\nimpressive and durable, and leads the mind to the richest\r\ncontemplations. If for such a race the earth is thus clothed, what\r\nmust heaven be?\r\n\r\nA reading habit is a great blessing. I am sure I find it so, for\r\nthough I have risen at 3 A.M. since I have been here, and not once\r\nbeen in bed at four, still I am not tired at night. A walk is a\r\nrefreshment to be had in the country in a moment, but at London half\r\na mile of street thronged and noisy, and then only a crowded park,\r\nwith sights to wound or to tempt. I do not like snow, but a deep one\r\nand blustering wind here is preferable to calm sunshine in the\r\nstreets of London.\r\n\r\nBut much as I like Bradfield even alone, I must leave it and get\r\nquickly into Essex. I could write the Report from materials before\r\nme, and from a long knowledge of the county, and produce a valuable\r\nwork, but that would not be honest. I shall take their money, and\r\nwill therefore travel as much in it, and give as much attention to\r\nit, as if I had no materials at all to work upon.\r\n\r\n_August 12._—Letters from Jane and Arthur at St. Petersburg. They\r\ngive sad accounts of the treatment the English have received there\r\nif most specific agreements be not made beforehand for everything. I\r\nwish cordially they were well home again, and so do they, I believe.\r\n\r\n_October 20._—At Rayleigh. To keep a journal in this manner is\r\nnonsense, and worse than nonsense; besides, I have time to do\r\nbetter, and therefore ought to do it.\r\n\r\nThree nights past I slept at the Earl of St. Vincent’s, who, being a\r\ngreat character, forces a note. I had much inclination to have\r\ncalled on him, as I heard of Sir T. Leonard that he farmed, but I\r\nthought it would be a forward step, and so passed on to the Squire\r\nof the parish, Towers. He was in with the gout, but his sons told me\r\nthat they had lately dined in company of Lord St. V., who mentioned\r\nmy being in the country, and that he expected to see me. Whence this\r\nexpectation came I have no conception. He received me politely,\r\npleasantly, and cordially; kept me all day to dinner and to sleep,\r\nand desired me if ever I came near him again to be sure to make his\r\nhouse my headquarters. He showed me every acre, cow, ox, and pig,\r\nand talked sensibly enough on farming, as far as he knew of it. When\r\nhe returned he told me he did not dine till 6 P.M., and as he should\r\nbe out again, I should have a fire in Lady St. V.’s dressing room,\r\nand a pen and ink, and that I was my own master. Montague Burgoyne\r\ncoming, he sent him up to me. At and after dinner much political\r\nconversation, for Burgoyne is a desperate politician. It was plain\r\nthat Lord St. Vincent thought himself very ill used by opposition as\r\nwell as by Mr. Pitt; he seemed to think that they made a great cry\r\nabout him while it served their own purpose, but that when this\r\nwould not answer, they cared little for him and forgot him, but he\r\npraised Lord Sidmouth greatly. Burgoyne, who wanted Fox in when Lord\r\nSidmouth accepted, told Lord St. V. the only sin he ever committed\r\nwas joining that lord, as he could not have made an administration\r\nwithout him. He said it was impossible to resist, the state of the\r\ncountry was such that his conscience would have condemned him; it\r\nwas greatly to his personal injury, for he was, as commander of the\r\nChannel fleet, in the receipt of a good 25,000_l._ a year, which he\r\ngave up for a miserably paid Cabinet place then of only 3,000_l._\r\nThat the King urged him to keep the command with the Admiralty, and\r\nLord Sidmouth agreed to it, but he would not do it, it would have\r\nbeen wrong. The King urged the precedent of Lord Howe, who kept\r\nboth, and why should not he? But he was firm. He hates all\r\nreligions, called Lord Barham an old canting hypocrite—all of\r\nthem—and ‘little Wilber-force too!’ I said something against that,\r\nbut not half enough. He remarked that the old hypocrite would soon,\r\nvery soon, be removed. I hope in this he will find himself mistaken.\r\nHe swears pretty much, not quite as sailors do, but he says grace\r\nbefore and after dinner; is not this hypocrisy? He has great\r\nspirits, a good understanding, and is very pleasant.\r\n\r\n_December 9._—My old friend Symonds being dangerously and in all\r\nprobability fatally ill, I went yesterday to see him. I was there\r\nfour hours. He dozed much, but when awake had the perfect use of his\r\nfaculties, though not quite speech enough or recollection to explain\r\nhimself as when well; my dear Jane took him to be a real Christian,\r\nthough not without thinking he had bad notions on certain points. I\r\never doubted it, and thought I saw much in him of sound, good\r\ndoctrine, but great deficiencies.\r\n\r\nHe utterly disbelieved original sin, which appeared always to me a\r\nfatal sign.\r\n\r\nHe talked to me of Naples, Bonaparte, &c., said he had something\r\n_particular_ to say to me, upon which B. left the room. It was to\r\ntell me that Cocksedge would not give 40_l._ for a very well done\r\nmap and survey of the Eldo estate, and that therefore he should take\r\ncare that he should have nothing done to accommodate him, no part of\r\nthe furniture should be his, &c. _This will be talked of_, and\r\ntherefore mention the motive. What stuff to occupy the attention of\r\na dying man! I took four or five opportunities, or rather made them,\r\nto turn his mind to Christ, but they passed, and he was silent, not\r\none religious or serious word came out of his mouth, nothing of the\r\nkind seemed to be in his mind. He was in general quite easy and\r\ncomposed, and slept perfectly free from any apparent disturbance.\r\nAwful is such insensibility.\r\n\r\n_10th._—I was with him again yesterday, and through such a day of\r\nrain that I hope I shall not take cold. He was just the same,\r\nmentioned Casburn’s account of the Blue Coat Hospital, and being\r\nwashed four times a day; talked of the water gods, smiled, and\r\njoked. I could not endure the moment passing without another attempt\r\nto turn his mind to more serious impressions. I asked C. if he had\r\nhad any prayers said to and for him. No, he had not mentioned it,\r\nbut two nights before he had prayed shortly for himself. I told him\r\nthat there ought to be prayers in the room, and that C. could read\r\nthem. He said, ‘_Yes, he could_,’ and for the family also! It made\r\nno impression, and soon after closing his eyes as if for sleep,\r\nsaid, ‘Your servant, I only keep you,’ so I left him. I have fears\r\nthat it is a sort of judicial blindness and insensibility of his\r\nstate to have his senses and make no better use of them, I am much\r\nshocked.\r\n\r\n_11th._—Yesterday there again, but he was getting up to have his bed\r\nmade, and White, the physician, thought I had better not go up.\r\n\r\n_January 10, 1806._—Peggy Metcalfe lent me ‘Marie Menzikoff’ as a\r\ntrue history, and I, like a fool, read much of it, after finding it\r\na mere romance. I have not looked at anything of the novel kind for\r\nmany years, but this French thing seized my attention and hurried me\r\non. I wish she had been further before putting it in my hands. It\r\nhas unhinged me, and broken my attention to better things, which\r\nshows strongly how pernicious this sort of reading is, and what a\r\npowerful temptation to vice such productions are sure to prove.\r\n\r\nOh! the number of miserables that novels have sent to perdition!\r\n\r\n_16th._—I have been looking over Dr. Johnson’s ‘Prayers and\r\nMeditations,’ and, upon the whole, the feeling they have impressed\r\nis that of pity; he seemed by one passage to think his complaints\r\nnearly allied to madness, and often speaks of his morbid melancholy;\r\nhis sloth seems to have been dreadful. What a contrast to the life\r\nof John Wesley!\r\n\r\nHis religion seems to have been against the very grain of his soul,\r\nand all the tendencies of his mind to have arisen from his\r\nunderstanding only, and never to have been truly in his heart.\r\nCompany, and engagements, and indolence keep him from church from\r\nJanuary to March; he scarcely ever got to it in time for the\r\nservice, and he aimed in resolutions only at taking the Sacrament\r\nthrice in the year; he does not name a book (the Scriptures\r\nexcepted) that was likely to give a right turn to his devotion. To\r\nstudy religion and to read the Scriptures was a matter for\r\nresolution, like rising early, but he does not seem to have been\r\ncarried to the employment by the comfort, hope, joy, and consolation\r\nto be derived from them, they were never his pleasure. ’Tis well his\r\nmind was morbid, for he seems to me (from this work) never to have\r\nbeen really converted. Fasting, penance, and a gloomy superstition\r\nbanished from his soul the felicities of piety founded in faith. But\r\nI must look it over again with more care. Yesterday morning I went\r\nto Flempton and called on Carter; with him I had some very proper\r\nconversation. He is far from the truly evangelical state, and his\r\nmind fully occupied with being satisfied with the opinions and\r\nconduct of the regular clergy in general; he has no affection, no\r\nregard for truly evangelical ones, a readiness to sneer at them, and\r\nwith all a laxity in doctrines, a comprehensive _candour_, which\r\ngives me but an ill opinion of his doctrines. He is a very worthy\r\nrespectable man in all worldly points.\r\n\r\nMy neighbour Gooch called yesterday. He has taken the curacy of\r\nWattisfield of Plampin, who has evaded the curate’s law. Gooch gave\r\nme twenty cases at least of rectors who decidedly cheat and impose\r\non their curates by most unworthy evasions; but if a farmer cheats\r\nthem of a turnip in tithe, they pronounce them all the rogues to be\r\nimagined. Most lamentable is this for those who should be the\r\nministers of Christ’s gospel.\r\n\r\nBut in no country that I have heard of is there such a set of clergy\r\nas in this neighbourhood. Dreadful!\r\n\r\nI have been sketching out an essay on the defence of the kingdom in\r\ncase of invasion, and yesterday added to it. The regularity with\r\nwhich I have made entries in my journal since I determined to write\r\none line in it, shows the infinite importance of method and\r\nregularity in every pursuit and business of life. What is regularly\r\nundertaken will be regularly executed, but desultory endeavours at\r\nfits and starts perform nothing.\r\n\r\n_22nd._—Yesterday I went up into my dear Bobbin’s room, in which I\r\nhad not been for a year or more. I wiped the mould off her books,\r\n&c., with a heavy heart, and prayed to God that I might join her\r\nspirit in heaven. It made me very melancholy! She has been dead nine\r\nyears, would therefore have been two-and-twenty had it pleased God\r\nto spare her. But what a world is this for a girl of that age!\r\n\r\n_23rd._—To-day I pack up and prepare, and to-morrow, with God’s\r\npermission, to London. May He protect me from all dangers! Mr. Pitt\r\ndead! This has struck a damp into my soul that I cannot shake off.\r\n\r\n_26th._—Arrived safely, thanks to the Lord. Yesterday I unpacked and\r\nset all my things in order. Mrs. Y. better than I expected, but I\r\ncannot perceive that warmth of gratitude to God which I hoped to\r\nfind. I know not what to make of her state of soul! Pitt’s death\r\nmade a considerable sensation, and I wonder not at it. The\r\nprovidence of the Almighty has taken the two men perhaps the most\r\nnecessary to our worldly prosperity in order to show us that it is\r\non Him only we should depend, and to convince us that vain is the\r\narm of flesh. May He protect us! Providence is better to depend on\r\nthan a hundred Nelsons and Pitts if we consider them in any light\r\nexcept that of means in the hand of Him who governs the fate of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nMinistry not arranged. It is said that Fox is as much plagued with\r\nthe apprehensions of some of his own people as with those of the\r\nGrenvilles. Grey First Lord of Admiralty! Is it possible? What a\r\nscheme!\r\n\r\nCould not sleep longer for three nights past than half-past two or\r\nthree; evil imaginations were generating. Plunged out of bed, but as\r\nI cannot get to bed before ten (at Lady Egremont’s last night but\r\none, and De Bees’ last night) it makes me heavy. De Bees says that\r\nall foreigners agree as to the folly of our expeditions; that to the\r\nMediterranean should have been in greater force to Venice, which\r\nwould have preserved that city, and enabled the Archduke Charles to\r\nhave stood his ground. It is obvious, if driven from the Continent,\r\nVenice at least would have been saved.\r\n\r\n_February 2._—I have seen Smirenove, he thinks his Emperor will have\r\na great army on the Danube early in the spring, for preparations are\r\nactive; they think, or have intelligence, that Bonaparte has ceded\r\nto Austria much more than Servia, probably large provinces, to cut\r\nRussia off from contact with the Turks. He has Trieste, and now his\r\ndominions embrace both shores of the Adriatic and join the Turkish\r\nEmpire. This must be productive of great events, and I cannot but\r\nlook forward to the destruction of that Empire which seems clearly\r\nadvancing, and we all know how very important an epoch that will be\r\ntowards the winding up of all things.\r\n\r\n_8th._—Mary dined with Lord Coventry, and met Mrs. Lyggon and Mrs.\r\nNesbit, and heard that D. Moira will take nothing. He wanted to be\r\nPrime Minister, and the King would rather have had him. The Queen of\r\nWurtemburg has written a letter to our Queen and to Lady Harrington\r\nin praise of the politeness and goodness of Bonaparte. De Bees in\r\nthe evening; Fox was in powder, which made everyone stare.\r\n\r\n_14th._—Read much in Skinner’s ‘State of Peru,’[231] which has some\r\ncurious things in it. I work every morning on my ‘Elements,’ but\r\nthough I have been near thirty years reading and making extracts for\r\nthis work (but with long intermissions), yet now I am arranging the\r\nchapters and sections I find numberless gaps to supply as I advance.\r\n\r\n_15th._—Dined with the Duke of Grafton against my will, for I think\r\nit wrong to go to the house of a Unitarian, or have anything to do\r\nwith them; the only defence of its lawfulness even that I know of is\r\nSt. Paul’s supposition of his converts being invited to a feast, and\r\n_if you are disposed to go_, &c., then do so. In the evening Walker,\r\nan engraver, who has been twenty years at St. Petersburg, and who\r\nbrought letters from Jane some time ago, called. He gives but a bad\r\naccount of Russia, and it is from every authority a very bad country\r\nto live in, in every respect that should make a country desirable,\r\nexcept the people being good tempered and very ingenious. England!\r\nEngland! thou art the first of countries! Oh! that thou wert\r\ngrateful to Heaven for the multitude of thy blessings.\r\n\r\n_20th._—Lord Carrington half an hour, then Vancouver,[232] who has\r\nseen Vansittart[233] on his tour scheme, and who did not seem to\r\napprove of it at all, but desired him to have an interview at\r\nTyrrwhitt’s with Dr. Beke to hear his opinion, whom he esteems much,\r\nthe greatest political arithmetician of the time. This is\r\naccordingly to take place. Vansittart told him the whole income of\r\nthe public is 200,000,000 sterling. V. replied that it was three\r\ntimes as much. At night I went to the Lock and heard a most\r\nexcellent sermon by Fry on Luke xi. 21, 22.\r\n\r\n_22nd._—It was so fine a day that I took a walk to Kensington\r\nGardens Gate. The Marquis of Hertford chatted with me for some time\r\nas he walked his horse, and wants a drainer for his estate in\r\nIreland. I saw Marshall[234] also, and I never see and converse with\r\nhim, but I think I see the haughty, proud, ill-tempered, snarling,\r\ndisgusted character which he manifested in his connection with Sir\r\nJohn Sinclair. A thousand pities that so extremely able a man, for\r\nof his talents there can be no question, should not have more\r\namenity and mildness. Government, however, should have promoted him\r\nwithout any doubt; and it is a blot in their scutcheon that they\r\nhave not done it.\r\n\r\nThe funeral of Mr. Pitt. I think him a very great national loss, and\r\ndid not go near any part of the business. Pomp and pageantry of all\r\nsorts do not accord with my feelings. A pamphlet published to\r\nprepare us for peace, ‘The Relative Situation of France and\r\nEngland,’ said to be by Wraxall.[235] I dread a peace politically,\r\nbut as a Christian all is directed by Him who cannot err.\r\n\r\n_25th._—I have of late been uneasy lest Dodsley, the bookseller,\r\nshould have lost much money by my ‘Experimental Agriculture,’ and\r\ncalled on Becket to know what became of him, and who he left. There\r\nI found that Nicoll was one of his executors, and now the only one\r\nleft. I went to him and desired some information. On examining the\r\nlist of his books he found there was but one single copy, and that\r\nconsequently to suppose he lost by the work would be idle. ‘I can\r\ntell you what he gave you for the copy, for here is one of the\r\ngreatest of curiosities.’ This was Dodsley’s book for authors’\r\nreceipts; in that he showed me William Burke’s receipt for 6_l._\r\n6_s._ on account of Edmund Burke, for the copy of the ‘Vindication\r\nof Natural Society.’ That book, said Nicoll, was so much admired in\r\nFrance by d’Alembert, Diderot, &c. &c., that it made them mad, and\r\nreally produced the Revolution.\r\n\r\n‘And now’ (he added) ‘I have shown you what Burke had for kindling\r\nthe Revolution, let me also show you what he had for putting it\r\nout,’ and then he pointed out his (Burke’s) own receipt for\r\n1,000_l._ for the profits of his famous volume. The [other]\r\nwritings, &c., one other of his later pamphlets, were sold together\r\nfor 300_l._ He seems, however, to have left it to Dodsley, and when\r\nthe things were sold, to have taken what D. said was fair. Melmoth\r\nhad a great deal of money of him, for his translations, &c.\r\n\r\nAt night letters to us all. Three came from Jane and Arthur. A sad\r\naccount of the interpreter provided for him, who is an ignorant\r\npuppy of a nobleman who is too lazy to do anything. Of all the\r\nGovernments I have heard of, it seems to be the most stupid, the\r\nmost ignorant, and the most profligate: the fact, I dare say, is\r\nthat the army alone is attended [to]. They had the news of the\r\nbattle of Austerlitz, with a loss as they supposed of 40,000\r\nRussians. Not a family at Moscow but must have lost a relation, yet\r\na grand ball that night, and nothing but gaiety and festivity. They\r\nhave no feeling. The governor took Jane into a window and told her\r\nthat he was informed she disapproved of all her husband’s farming\r\nideas as much as anyone could do, and ridiculed all his schemes.\r\nUpon explanation it came from Marshall Romanzoff, who had it from a\r\nGerman baron that had been at Bradfield, who, admiring the number of\r\nexperiments, Mrs. Y. told him that she detested them all, and that I\r\nhad ruined myself by them. A true report I will answer for, for this\r\nwas her conduct through life. Lamentable it was that no enemy ever\r\ndid me the mischief that I received from the wife of my bosom by the\r\ngrossest falsehoods and the blackest malignity; of just such\r\nanecdotes of her conversation I have had instances from every part\r\nof the world. But do such things rise from the dust? Oh! no, they\r\ncome from God, and were far less than what I merited at His hands. I\r\nhad such as I deserved, or much better.\r\n\r\n_27th._—I was up at four o’clock and kept the fast till 8.30 at\r\nnight; and as I have a strong stomach that will bear it pretty well,\r\nI determined to take no snuff, of which I every day take much, and\r\nam almost uncomfortable if at any time I forget my box. This was\r\nmore a fast with me than abstaining from food; but whether it was\r\nnot done in a right spirit, or that I had thought about it too much,\r\nI know not, but I was dead, and sleepy, and sluggish in body and\r\nsoul all day except at the evening sermon. Unluckily the night\r\nbefore the fast long letters from Russia, and an account that Arthur\r\nhad been warned much as if he would be murdered, so determinately\r\nhostile to the object are all the Russian nobility.\r\n\r\n_March 1._—Yesterday was a most worrying moment, full of labour and\r\nanxiety. In the morning to Smirenove, to read him my letter to\r\nNovosilikoff. He advised me to call on Count Strogonoff, who is here\r\non a political mission, and who treated with Arthur at St.\r\nPetersburg. Accordingly, as soon as I returned, I wrote to request\r\nhe would name a time for my waiting on him, which he did, and fixed\r\nSunday, 10.30. Oh, how the world values that day!\r\n\r\nThen to copy fair my letter to Novosilikoff and inclose it to Arthur\r\nin his; this, with two hundred other things, kept me till dinner on\r\nthe table to the chin in anxiety, for if I did not trust in the\r\ngoodness and mercy of God’s providence, I should be fearfully\r\napprehensive of my son’s personal safety, the hints he has had are\r\nalarming.\r\n\r\nTheir general conviction at Moscow, that he is come with full powers\r\nor intentions to emancipate the boors, have made them all hostile to\r\nthe plan.\r\n\r\n_March 17._—Yesterday morning, at 4 A.M., I came down to pray\r\naccording to custom, and it pleased God that I should pray with more\r\nthan usual fervency. I then meditated a little and fell asleep. I\r\nawaked with a certain sweetness of frame that I noticed at the time,\r\nand a transitory idea crossed my mind that God had heard my prayers,\r\nand that what I felt might possibly be His grace, or an effusion in\r\nsome small degree of the Holy Spirit in my soul. It struck me also\r\nthat I should know if it was by the current of my thoughts and\r\nimaginations; for any proof of the Spirit unattended by good effects\r\nwould be a mere fanatical idea. I took the blessed Sacrament, and in\r\nthe evening Fry preached on the means of ascertaining whether a man\r\nhas the Spirit or not—a very excellent sermon, and one well adapted\r\nto urge and assist self-examination. The day closed, and I was not\r\nsensible of giving way to any loose and wild imaginations.\r\n\r\n_23rd._—Thanks to the ever blessed God, I think that I spent last\r\nweek in a more satisfactory frame of heart and mind than any for an\r\nage past—more upon the watch against sin—more in contemplation of\r\nthe greatness and goodness of God; vile thoughts have intruded, but\r\nI dismissed them by struggling, and my prayers have been more\r\nfervent.\r\n\r\n_April 19._—I have only to-day and to-morrow in the country.\r\nSolitude agrees best with my soul. I read all day, and only\r\ndivinity, temptations are distant. Wesley could not bear the\r\ncountry, from the hurry and bustle of his perpetual labours having\r\ngiven him habits quite contrary to it.\r\n\r\n_June 3._—I was up again this morning at 3 A.M., and by it escaped\r\nfalling into evil imaginations. This is an evil I thus fight against\r\nand struggle to avoid. I think the Lord will hear my prayers and\r\nfree me from this buffeting of Satan, this thorn in the flesh, which\r\nis a horrible disquiet to me.\r\n\r\n_4th._—I found the devil at work with me this morning, and jumped\r\nout of bed at twenty minutes before 3 A.M., dressed, and came down\r\nto prayers.\r\n\r\nPaying debts formerly with me had but little effect from the\r\nnecessary contraction of new ones; but at present I have abstained\r\nsteadily from all, so that though I want shirts, &c., and have only\r\none coat, and that much worn, yet I order nothing, that I may\r\nendeavour effectively to get quite free as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n_17th._—A letter from Arthur, he has had a week’s fever, and went\r\nback to Moscow, which recovered him. It was caused by want of sleep,\r\nowing to bugs, lice, fleas, &c., fatigue and vile food. They are\r\nhorrid savages, and five centuries behind us in all but vice,\r\nwickedness, and extravagance. The interpreter behaves much better,\r\nwhich is comfortable.\r\n\r\n_18th._—The last Board for the season sat yesterday and adjourned\r\ntill November. Mr. Coke was here, pressed me to go to Holkham; but I\r\nhave long determined against it; there is not one feature which\r\ncould carry a Christian there for pleasure, but a thousand to repel\r\nhim, and this is so much the case with all public meetings that they\r\nare odious. The Norfolk farmers are rich and profligate; of course\r\noaths and profanations salute the ear at every turn; and gentlemen\r\nand the great, when without ladies, are too apt to be as bad as the\r\nmob, and many of them much worse. I am never in such company, but\r\nthe repugnance of my soul to it is so great, that much as I love\r\nagriculture I can renounce it with more pleasure than I can partake\r\nof it thus contaminated. I shall get to Bradfield as soon as\r\npossible, I hope on Saturday, and having much to do there, God send\r\nthat employment may keep me out of all temptation.\r\n\r\n_July 13._—Every Sunday I hear sixteen or eighteen children read the\r\nScripture and say their Catechism, and I pay for the schooling of\r\nall that will learn. They are sadly careless and inattentive, but\r\nstill they come on. If it pleases God to turn it to account by their\r\nreading the Scriptures it will be well. The rest of the day I pass\r\nin reading; the spirit of visiting in the country among servants\r\nprevents much that might be done, but still I am not satisfied, and\r\nmust find the means of doing more in the instruction of the parish\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n_14th._—I have been reading over my ‘Inquiry into the Propriety of\r\napplying Wastes to the better Maintenance of the Poor.’ I had almost\r\nforgotten it, but of all the essays and papers I have produced, none\r\nI think so pardonable as this, so convincing by facts, and so\r\nsatisfactory to any candid reader. Thank God I wrote it, for though\r\nit never had the smallest effect except in exciting opposition and\r\nridicule, it will, I trust, remain a proof of what ought to have\r\nbeen done; and had it been executed, would have diffused more\r\ncomfort among the poor than any proposition that ever was made.\r\n\r\n_February 21, 1807._—To think of keeping a journal regularly is all\r\nin vain; the gaps in mine are terrible.\r\n\r\n_March 9._—Mrs. Wilberforce lent me Crichton’s ‘Diary of\r\nBlackadder,’[236] and gave me Dr. Owen on the 130th Psalm. I have\r\nread much of the former and find it a reproach to my whole soul,\r\nlife, and conversation. What a Christian was there! and what a\r\nwretch am I?\r\n\r\n_10th._—I am very much struck with ‘Blackadder’s Diary’ and letters\r\nto his wife, so much so that I have prayed earnestly to God to\r\nenable me by His grace to have the same constant trust and reliance\r\nin His mercy and goodness that this excellent Christian had.\r\n\r\n_12th._—The Marquis Saloo, from Sicily, gave me many accounts of\r\nBolsamo, and how much he referred in his lectures to his master,\r\nArthur Young. If there be glory in this sort of fame, oh! my Father,\r\nlet me have done with glorying save in the Cross of the Lord Jesus.\r\nI have been glorying in foreign and domestic fame for forty years in\r\ntrue fleshly vanity.\r\n\r\nI have been seven weeks in London, and, blessed be the Lord, I have\r\nhad only four or five invitations to dinner and accepted but two.\r\nThere has been a great kick up in the Ministry. Tyrrwhitt, from\r\nCarleton House, called here, and tells me that Lord Sidmouth and his\r\nfriends were actually _out_, but the Foxites made it up with the\r\nKing, pacified him, and they were immediately restored; but Lord\r\nHowick and the rest are to give their opinion in the House of\r\nCommons, and the obnoxious clause to be left out. The King is ready\r\nto turn many out the moment there is strength enough to carry on\r\nbusiness without them.\r\n\r\nCalled at Lord Egremont’s; that detestable atheistical profligate\r\nkinsman —— was with him. Lord E. loud in the commendation of the\r\n_Dactylis glomerata_;[237] it succeeds so greatly with him on cold,\r\nstrong, wet lands that oxen fatten where they could never be _kept_\r\nbefore, and it grows all winter. I was the first man in England that\r\nhad five acres of this grass. I believe they had a root of it twenty\r\nyears ago; I had much, and recommended it greatly.\r\n\r\nA letter from Tyrrwhitt, Carleton House, to inform me that\r\nVansittart and Lord Grenville approve my plan, which I proposed to\r\nT. It is this: The Baltic and co. [country] around it being shut up\r\nor eaten up, and 400,000 men in our grainery [granary], should we\r\nthis year have a short crop of wheat or a bad harvest, or a mildew,\r\nthe supply being cut off, the price would rise beyond all\r\nexperience; therefore I propose that the Government should supply\r\nmoney to enable the Board to give great premium for the culture of\r\npotatoes _for the use of cattle and horses_; without this object an\r\nalarm might spread and more mischief than good accrue. T. writes me\r\nthey approve the idea, and will _advance_ the Board 2,000_l._, but I\r\nwill have this explained; it must not be to lend 2,000_l._ but to\r\n_give_ it.\r\n\r\n_March 26._—I am very sure that I do not give to poor Christians so\r\nmuch as I ought to do, but I am in doubt whether I do not give more\r\nthan I ought to do to others. Here is a German, Behrens, once a\r\nmerchant in good circumstances, whom Sir John received papers from\r\nand sent to me. He translated a paper for the Board, and made known\r\nsuch poverty that I promised him a pair of boots; but writing to him\r\non the translation, I took occasion to enquire what religion he was\r\nof; he was educated a Lutheran, but I see plainly he has none. He\r\nshall have the boots, but I shall give him nothing else. I can do\r\nnothing for Christians if I give to all others that apply.\r\n\r\n_April 6._—At Bradfield. There is a poor fellow in the gaol\r\ncondemned to die next Wednesday for forging or uttering bank notes.\r\nI heard some bad accounts of him, and as I came from Bury early in\r\nthe morning, yesterday called to see him. I found that he had been\r\nattended by the minister, Mr. Hastead, and also by a Methodist,\r\nrecommended by a brother of his. I had a good deal of conversation\r\nwith him, and prayed with him. He was very ignorant, and had no\r\nfeeling of religion till he was condemned, but has since been\r\ninstructed and spoke properly enough, lamenting his want of faith at\r\ntimes, and at others being full of faith. I gave him the best\r\ninstruction I could, and urged little more than (which is his only\r\npossible hope) faith in the Lord Jesus. He prayed aloud for some\r\nminutes, and more to the purpose than I should have expected. He\r\nthanked me much for coming, and as he begged me to come again I\r\npromised, and accordingly this morning went on purpose. It comforted\r\nhim much. I prayed earnestly and fervently for him, and his amens\r\nand ejaculations seemed to come quite from his heart. I left him\r\ntranquil, and, blessed be a merciful God, I think he may without\r\npresumption hope strongly for pardon at the throne of mercy.\r\n\r\nI am planting lands, and forming an experiment on the application of\r\nvegetable substances as manure.\r\n\r\n_29th._—London. At eight o’clock at night I received the following\r\nnote from Sir John Sinclair. I hurried away to the place named in\r\nthe cover, Great Shire Lane, where I found Sir John; and Dr.\r\nGarthshore on the same errand as myself.\r\n\r\nWe signed a bail bond.\r\n\r\n  ‘My dear Sir,—A most extraordinary circumstance has happened to\r\n  me. A rascally saddler, whom I employed at Edinburgh to furnish\r\n  accoutrements to my regiment of Invincibles, brought me in so\r\n  exorbitant an amount, that I refused to pay it; and instead of\r\n  bringing an action against me at Edinburgh, he has arrested me for\r\n  750_l._ So many of my friends are out of town, that I must trouble\r\n  you to give bail for my appearance.\r\n\r\n                                         ‘Sincerely yours,\r\n                                                     ‘JOHN SINCLAIR.\r\n\r\n  ‘Tuesday.’\r\n\r\nSir John’s regiment has been disbanded nine or ten years, and\r\nconsequently this rascally saddler has been at least so long kept\r\nout of his money. What can these people think of themselves! To live\r\nquietly while thus depriving tradesmen of their right for such a\r\nnumber of years!\r\n\r\n_May 16._—This is the first fine day that has occurred since I left\r\ntown; the lilacs are coming fast into blossom, and the fresh verdure\r\nof the grass and trees is highly pleasing.\r\n\r\n_August 29._—As the time approaches to go this Oxford journey, I\r\ndislike it more and more, and wish I had firmly rejected it. I am\r\nnot in a situation at all comfortable here, and have only one\r\nmaid—no man or boy—and only the carpenter to put my horse in the\r\nwhisky; but with a little exertion all this could be arranged. Mrs.\r\nY. going to the sea for seven weeks, and therefore seven weeks’\r\npeace here if I stayed. I am in a regular habitual application to my\r\n‘Elements,’ and have made a good progress in them, so that if I kept\r\nhere I should have gone through many meetings of the Board; and then\r\nif it pleased the Lord to take me, they would at least be in a state\r\nto be serviceable to mankind, and the great collection I have made\r\nin divinity would gradually be brought into order.\r\n\r\nAll around here is a region dead in iniquity and sins, as far as\r\nladies and gentlemen are concerned. Amongst the Sectaries there is\r\nChristianity, and nowhere else, which is a horrible thing to think\r\nof. The clergy are, if possible, more dead than any others; many of\r\nthem very profligate, many thoroughly worldly minded, but some of\r\nvery respectable moral characters, but without a spark of vital\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nI associate only with Mrs. O. Oakes. Having written till I am tired,\r\nI go once or twice a week to relax with the mild green (_sic_) of\r\nher soul, because I can be free and do as I like, and I try hard to\r\nmake her a Christian, but hitherto in vain. If evil ideas at any\r\ntime plague me, then I keep away, and, thanks to God, I have of late\r\nhad an unusual command over my imagination, which for years plagued\r\nme terribly. Prayer is my refuge.\r\n\r\n_November 23._—The 17th, 18th, and 19th at Euston, and I had much\r\nconversation with the duke, in which I earnestly endeavoured to\r\nimpress on his mind the fact, that by his tenets he placed himself\r\nentirely under the covenant of works, and that he must be tried for\r\nthem, and that I would not be in such a situation for ten thousand\r\nworlds. He was mild and more patient than I expected.\r\n\r\nHe lent me, and I read it there, Priestley’s Life, by himself. He\r\nasked me what I thought of it? My reply was that through the whole\r\nit was the recital of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself,\r\nnot the confessions of a sinner lamenting what has been wrong in\r\nhim. He seems to have had no feeling of the sort; as if, when tried\r\nby the test of his own merit, it would be a great injustice in God\r\nnot to be satisfied with him, and that I had no conception of any\r\nman having it in his power to review or detail his life with any\r\nreligious aspect without much self-condemnation, and beseeching God\r\nto try him in any way rather than by an appeal to his life or his\r\nown merit, but (if he be really a Christian) by the merits only of\r\nthe blood of his Redeemer. He said it was my view of things, and not\r\nthat of the doctor, whom he believed was undoubtedly a very good\r\nman. The conversation continued, but we were as far as the poles\r\nasunder. The duke has drawn up memoirs of his life, and he and Lady\r\nAugusta read to me that part which concerned his own administration,\r\nwhich is very satisfactory, as it consists much of original letters.\r\nHe appears to much more advantage in it than I conceived he would\r\nhave done, and it was certainly a wise step to leave such a memorial\r\nin justification of himself. Lord Templeton there one day. They seem\r\nto me to grow more and more economical, and to descend to minute\r\nattentions which are below their rank and fortune.\r\n\r\nI do not feel comfortable, though he always receives me well, and\r\ndesires me to come again. It is long since I was there before, and\r\nwill be long before I go again; such visits, however, have very\r\nlittle of dissipation in them, and so much the better.\r\n\r\nThe less we like them the safer they are.\r\n\r\n[Note, probably by Mary, Arthur Young’s only surviving daughter]:\r\n‘1807. It was upon this journey [into Oxfordshire] that Mr. Y. first\r\nperceived the approach of that dimness of sight which afterwards\r\nterminated in its total eclipse. His first suspicion arose from\r\nlooking at the planet Jupiter, and perceiving what appeared to him\r\nto be two very small stars near him, at which he was much surprised,\r\nas he knew that the satellites were invisible to the naked eye, and\r\nnobody saw these stars but himself. This multiplication of bright\r\nobjects increased the following year, till at last one lamp appeared\r\nto him to be five. Objects became by degrees more and more confused,\r\nand at last totally disappeared.’\r\n\r\n(Total blindness appears to have resulted from the failure of an\r\noperation for cataract, as will be seen later on.)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 223:\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Oakes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 224:\r\n\r\n  This recalls Goethe’s line, ‘Der Augenblick ist Ewigkeit.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 225:\r\n\r\n  Ch.

If I am so ungrateful as not to thank God\r\nsufficiently for blessings, how can I expect to avoid misfortunes?\r\nMy eyes! My eyes! Is not His hand upon me here, too, for the same\r\nreason?\r\n\r\nWhat has been my gratitude to Him for their preservation during\r\nsixty-seven years? and what uses have I made of them?\r\n\r\n_April 4._—How employment can be carried further than with me I am\r\nat a loss to conceive. Notwithstanding the state of my eyes I am\r\ngenerally up at 4 A.M., though I do not call St. Croix [his reader]\r\nbefore five.\r\n\r\nLast Tuesday I read the first lecture that was, I believe, ever read\r\non agriculture in England, my subject ‘Tillage at the Board,’ The\r\nroom was well filled, and several of much ability and more of rank;\r\nbut the day was a bad one, which kept others away. I found that they\r\nwere well satisfied.\r\n\r\nSo many years in the habit of incessant employment has made any\r\nidleness irksome to me. But my eyes force me to have time for\r\ncontemplation; and I pray to God to enable me to fill it as a\r\nChristian ought to do whose conversation is in heaven; but my mind\r\nwill run out too much on worldly objects, and sometimes on sinful\r\nones.\r\n\r\nHow much in all things do I want washing in the fountain opened for\r\nsin and uncleanness!\r\n\r\n_May 13._—Much of my time has of late been lost by people calling on\r\nthe malt business.[238] I am tired of sugar and malt before the\r\nquestion comes into the House of Commons, which will not be till\r\nMonday. I sent another letter to Cobbett last Monday, but he did not\r\ninsert it. I care little about it, and I wish that I cared less, for\r\nthese questions only connect one more nearly with the world than a\r\nChristian ought to be connected with it.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is in my vocation, and my conscience is not at all\r\nwounded by the part I take, for I am well persuaded that the\r\nconsequences of this measure will be mischievous and tend to\r\nscarcity, which is so greatly to be guarded against for a thousand\r\nreasons. Sir John Sinclair spoke once against it in the House, and\r\nhe tells me that Percival looked as black and indignant at him as if\r\nhe had been talking treason.\r\n\r\n_July 25: Bradfield._—I am tired of the thoughts of such a journal;\r\nhad I kept it of late it would have been employed on my departing\r\nsight. I can see to write a little, but can read scarcely anything.\r\n\r\nPraised be the mercy of God that enables me to pay a reader; St.\r\nCroix is with me. And I have been hard at work on my ‘Elements’ to\r\nget those papers into such order as to want as little as possible my\r\nown sight in the future progress of completing them. Whenever it may\r\nbe the will of God to make me quite blind, oh! may I receive His\r\ndispensation with the submission of a Christian!\r\n\r\n_1809. May 16._—April twelvemonth I read my own lectures by means of\r\nBaker’s great hand and black ink; but last month Mr. Cragg read the\r\ntwo, and one new one for me, for I am unable to do it; yet I can\r\nwrite a little, but cannot read when written. The Lord’s will be\r\ndone, and may He sanctify the affliction and turn all my attention\r\nto Himself.\r\n\r\nMrs. Oakes arrived at Bury last Sunday fortnight; and on Sunday\r\nse’nnight she broke a blood-vessel and brought up two spoonfuls, and\r\non Saturday evening last had another smaller attack. My own fear and\r\nopinion is that it will end fatally. Her fatigue coming from Bath\r\nand Bristol, and at London, contrary to advice, has caused it. I\r\nhave prayed most earnestly for her. Oh! may the Lord of all mercy\r\nhear and grant my petitions. My thoughts are all employed on the\r\nstate of her soul. The long intimacy and friendship I have had for\r\nher, and the kindness and attention I have ever received from her,\r\nnow lacerate the heart with wounds that sink deep; and my conscience\r\nreproaches me that I have not done all that I might have done to\r\nturn her heart more to God.\r\n\r\n_May 18._—I am very, very unhappy, and cannot think of her without\r\nwretchedness. In every worldly respect what a loss will she be to\r\nme! A placid, sweet temper, with a good understanding; that ever\r\nrec^d. [received] me with kindness, and attention, and preference,\r\nwith whom I was at my ease, and where I could be at any time; a\r\nresource in blindness fast coming on that would have been great. The\r\nhope has fled and a sad and dreary vacancy, which freezes me, is in\r\nits place.\r\n\r\n_May 19._—Good news though not of better health. Hastead has been\r\nwith her, to be sure, by desire, which shows an attention to her\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nPoor thing! she has been bled twice more, and the blood as highly\r\ninflamed as ever; bleeding gives relief to her lungs.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Bedford and Mr. Coke [have written] desiring me to go to\r\nWoburn and Holkham; but all great meetings, and anything like\r\nfestivity, have for some years become so insipid and disagreeable\r\nthat I shall have done with them wholly. They, like so many other\r\nthings, are links of that worldly harness which it is high time for\r\nme to throw down for ever.\r\n\r\n_June 1._—Read the ‘Edinburgh Review’ on ‘Cœlebs in Search of a\r\nWife,’ by Sydney Smith. Wretched stuff; false and frivolous,\r\nreasoning on cards, assemblies, plays,[239] &c.\r\n\r\n_June 3._—Yesterday, as the ‘Edinburgh Review’ was read to me, I was\r\nmuch struck with a reference to Necker on the finances, saying that\r\n7,000 pedigrees of the nobility in the archives of the old\r\nGovernment were destroyed in the Revolution. It occurred at once to\r\nme that this was the exact number of _names_ of _men_ slain in\r\nRevelations. It is in the eleventh chapter: ‘The tenth part of the\r\ncity fell in a great earthquake, and 7,000, &c.’ The commentators\r\nall seem to have reckoned France as the tenth part of the city; but\r\nof the names of men they knew not what to make, but 7,000 pedigrees\r\nanswer to a wonderful degree, and the coincidence of numbers is\r\ntruly amazing.\r\n\r\n_June 6._—Yesterday’s letter bad. Poor thing, she has been bled\r\neight ounces, and much inflamed; had been out twice, and I suppose\r\ntook cold. She wrote herself, and there are some comfortable\r\nexpressions relative to the state of her mind with regard to\r\nreligion. I have little hope of her recovery.\r\n\r\n_July 4._—Betsy continues just the same, whether better or worse,\r\nthe cough does not go, and therefore I conclude the case bad. But,\r\nthanks to God, her mind, I hope, goes on; she has the Testament read\r\nto her by all the four children.\r\n\r\n_July 6._—I work at the ‘Elements’ every day, and find every time\r\nthey are read to me something to cancel, something to add, and much\r\nto reconsider and correct.\r\n\r\n_July 8._—The gradual declension of my sight in viewing the scenery\r\nof this place, but especially in knowing faces, makes me surprised\r\nthat I can manage to write; I cannot read in the least degree, or\r\nknow anything of the views in Lord Valentia’s Travels.[240] It is a\r\nvery great deprivation, but much better than feeling the torture of\r\nvery painful distempers, so that I am very thankful to God for the\r\nless affliction. It was, I doubt not, very necessary for me to have\r\nsome heavy one, and what I am likely to suffer is comparatively a\r\nmercy to what might have been the dispensation of the Almighty.\r\n\r\nMrs. O. the same, and the weather as unfavourable to her; I drank\r\ntea there on Thursday.\r\n\r\n_July 19._—Drank tea with her last night. [She was] bled in the\r\nmorning, and going to have a blister. All her symptoms worse, I\r\nsuppose she has caught cold.\r\n\r\n_August 4._—I have been so provoked, my dear Jane,[241] with so many\r\nof my letters miscarrying that I am determined to begin a book to\r\nuse some safe opportunity of conveying it to you, for I know nothing\r\nso provoking as to write twenty letters for one or two that arrive\r\nsafe. In your last you made many enquiries into what I was doing?\r\nHow I passed my time, &c. &c. A very short account will answer this.\r\nI rise from four to five in the morning, pray to God for half an\r\nhour, more or less, according as He affords me the spirit to do it.\r\nAt half-past five I call Mr. St. Croix, who comes to me at six, and\r\nreads a chapter in Scott’s Bible with notes. I then dictate such\r\nletters as want to be written, after which we sit down to my\r\n‘Elements of Agriculture,’ which have been more than thirty years in\r\nhand, and at which I have worked for two years past with much\r\nassiduity, wishing to finish it before my sight is quite gone. At\r\nhalf-past eight the servant brings me the water to shave; from nine\r\nto ten we breakfast, and sit down again to work for two or three\r\nhours, as it may happen, as I take the opportunity of sunshine for a\r\nbrisk walk of an hour, very often backwards and forwards on the\r\ngravel between yours and the round garden. I wish much to have my\r\nthoughts during that hour employed upon death and the other world,\r\nbut my weakness and want of resolution are lamentable, so that I\r\nsometimes think on every subject except that which I intend should\r\noccupy me. We then sit down to work again, till the boy and his\r\ndicky arrive with the letters and newspapers. When they are read we\r\nwork again, but usually catch half an hour for another walk before\r\ndinner. When alone we dine at four, and always at that hour in the\r\nheight of summer, but if any person be in the house, as it prevents\r\nan evening work, five is the dinner hour. What is read afterwards is\r\nusually some book not immediately connected with work. At eight we\r\ndrink tea and go to bed at ten, but the Sunday is an exception; you\r\nknow there is service but once a day. At the church hour, whether\r\nmorning or afternoon (when no service), about thirty children from\r\nBradfield, Stanningfield, and Cuckfield come to read in the\r\nTestament and repeat their Catechism, and undergo some examination\r\nfrom Mrs. Trimmer’s ‘Teacher’s Assistant.’ Whatever is well done\r\nreceives a mark against the name; the girl or boy that has fewest\r\nmarks receives nothing, the next a halfpenny, next a penny, and so\r\non, all which does not amount to more than two or three shillings. I\r\ncannot boast much of their progress, though I pay for most of them\r\nas constant scholars. In the evening, between six and seven o’clock,\r\nforms are set in the hall to receive all that please to come to hear\r\na sermon read, and the numbers who attend amount from twenty to\r\nsixty or seventy, according to weather and other circumstances.\r\nSuch, my dear Jane, is the tenor of my life both in summer and\r\nwinter while I am in the country.\r\n\r\n_December 1._[242]—Here is a pretty breach in the continuance of\r\nthis book letter, but you are not to fail to remember that during\r\nthis period I have sent off two letters to you, not short ones,\r\nwhich, from Smirenove’s account of the conveyance, I hope may get to\r\nyou safe. I have also received two short ones from you, and another\r\nfrom Arthur at Odessa, describing the severity of the winter, and an\r\nescape he had of being burnt in a Tartar combustion of old grass,\r\nbut, most provokingly, saying not one word of his own intentions, or\r\na syllable of what he is about. This is very mortifying to me, for\r\nwhat are frost and fire to me compared with his own plans and views?\r\nNor does he say a word about coming to England; and the idea of the\r\npossibility of your coming in autumn is now all past by, and I am\r\nprecluded from the possibility of seeing you till next summer, by\r\nwhich time I shall have no eyes to see you.\r\n\r\n_April 9, 1810._[243]—The discovery lately made by your letter of\r\nthe enormous expense of postage must limit my correspondence to\r\nprivate hands, and will not permit the communication of anything but\r\ntopics the most immediately interesting to your future motions. My\r\nnotes of the riots, therefore, are preserved for your eye by copying\r\na letter to Mrs. Oakes:—\r\n\r\n‘I know not what reports may have reached you relative to the state\r\nof London, nor what newspapers you read, but I have been witness to\r\nsuch a scene as I hope, through the blessing of God, will not occur\r\nagain. On Friday night the mob was extremely agitated in Piccadilly,\r\nespecially near Sir Francis Burdett’s, and they took the\r\nunaccountable whim of forcing everyone to illuminate. I lighted up\r\nas other people did, and when I went to bed left orders with the\r\nservant who sat up to be sure to keep the candles burning till\r\ndaylight, instead of which, when others put out their candles, ours\r\nwere extinguished also. At two o’clock the mob returned and broke\r\nmany windows, and ours among the rest. The servant ran into my room\r\nand waked me out of my sleep to tell me the windows were smashing.\r\nWe hurried the candles out again, and, upon examination, found the\r\nalarm exceeded the damage, for only three panes were broken. All\r\nSaturday passed in a very quiet manner, and in the evening the\r\nillumination was more general, but troops pouring into London from\r\nall quarters, we hoped to be secure without violence. The mob,\r\nhowever, were so determined, that by twelve o’clock we heard\r\nplatoons firing in Piccadilly, and a few in other directions more\r\nremote, the Riot Act having been read. A person who saw much, and\r\nclearly, told me that orders being received by the commanding\r\nofficer to fire with ball, about fifty cavalry fired twice over the\r\nheads of the people, that the whizzing of the balls might inform\r\nthem what they had to expect; still, however, they were audacious,\r\ninsomuch that the officer was forced to fire on them. In five\r\nminutes all Piccadilly was cleared. We afterwards heard a little\r\nmore distant firing, and a party of horse scoured up Sackville\r\nStreet, firing in a scattered manner at the flying mob; but, from\r\nthe reports of the pieces, I believe with powder only. The reports\r\nrelative to the mischief done are extremely vague and not to be\r\ndepended on. Some say that one trooper was killed, others three or\r\nfour; what was the loss suffered by the mob is, I believe, quite\r\nunknown, but certainly it was very inconsiderable. During Sunday the\r\nagitation of the streets threatened a bad night, but Government had\r\nbrought in so many troops, that had we known it we need not have\r\nbeen alarmed. A train of artillery in the park, horses attached and\r\nmatches lighted, two pieces of artillery in Berkeley Square, two\r\nothers in Soho Square, and many more about the town, and doubtless\r\nmany others of which I knew nothing, all ready at a moment’s\r\nwarning, with parties of troops scouring the streets, showed such a\r\nstate of preparation as effectually awed the mob, notwithstanding\r\nthe efforts of Sir F. Burdett to inflame them. He was at his house\r\nready to resist the Speaker’s warrant for commitment, and had the\r\naudacity to write to the sheriff to bring the _posse comitatus_ to\r\nassist him in so doing, printing the letter in the Sunday’s\r\nnewspaper. They say he is still at his house, and that he will not\r\nbe seized before the House meets this day. It really is a tremendous\r\nmoment, for if they do not carry it with a high hand, as a means of\r\nprevention, we shall have an organised mob and great mischief will\r\nfollow. It is expected that the gallery of the House will to-day be\r\ncleared by acclamation and a Bill brought in to suspend the Habeas\r\nCorpus Act, and the rascally authors, printers, and publishers of\r\nthose inflammatory papers which have done so much mischief seized\r\nand imprisoned; but whether the Ministry, with such a violent\r\nopposition, will have resolution enough for this will depend on the\r\ninfluence the Marquis of Wellesley has among his colleagues in the\r\nCabinet. I am much inclined to expect that good will result by\r\ndrawing close to the Ministry all the honest men in both Houses,\r\nwith all others that might be wavering; for it is a question now\r\nwhether we are to be governed by Parliament or the mob. Many\r\ncircumstances, however, are unfortunate, and not the least, that\r\nthough the public revenue amounts to 62,000,000_l._, yet the\r\nexpenses of the year will rise to above 80,000,000_l._, and must be\r\nmade good by means that will occasion the necessity of having\r\nadditional taxes. This will cause a yell for peace—and such a peace\r\nas must be ruinous if made. We have also one adversary armed at all\r\npoints, and whose depth of policy is such as ought ever to create\r\nalarm and the exertions of all the talents the country possesses to\r\noppose him.’\r\n\r\n_May 3, 1811._—I do not think that for the last twenty years of my\r\nlife my general health has been better than at the moment when\r\ndiscontent, I fear, with the will of God, induced me to oppose that\r\nwill. In the most mild and merciful manner He had nearly deprived me\r\nof sight without my feeling the smallest pain. Heavy as this\r\ndreadful deprivation is and must remain to me, I feel, in proportion\r\nto my convalescence, that even blindness itself may be a temptation;\r\nas a dispensation from God, it must have been meant as a calamity,\r\nand a calamity to be deeply felt. Is there not danger then that a\r\nmind which has been accustomed to look upon the favourable side of\r\nobjects, should gradually so accustom itself to its new situation as\r\nto deprive it in a good measure of the misery which might be the\r\ndirect intention of the Almighty? The capacity of continuing the\r\nattention formerly given to old objects by means of the eyes of\r\nothers, may leave the mind almost as full of the world as when by\r\nsight I could enjoy its visible objects; this is a circumstance\r\nwhich ought undoubtedly to be guarded against, that is, prayed\r\nagainst. For a man of seventy to be struck blind and to continue\r\nworldly-minded, with his head and heart full of objects which,\r\nthough not of sight, command attention, is to tempt God to send some\r\ndeeper affliction in order to bring his heart home to its true\r\ncentre. This is a subject which merits great attention, and may the\r\nLord of His mercy enable me to consider it as I ought to do!\r\n\r\n_May 8._—Twelve o’clock at noon my dear friend Mrs. Oakes breathed\r\nher last, after a long severe illness, and many and great\r\nsufferings. Thanks to God she was attentive throughout this sad\r\nperiod, as I am well informed, to the state of her soul with God.\r\nThus is terminated in this world a very intimate friendship of\r\ntwenty-six years, with a temper so mild and cheerful, with manners\r\nso gentle and persuasive, that had it pleased the Almighty to have\r\nspared her, she would have been the source of great comfort to me in\r\nmy melancholy state.\r\n\r\n_May 16, 1812._—At this time a new oculist appeared in town, a\r\ndesideratum much wanted. The highest accounts were universally\r\ncirculated of his skill and success, and the most unequivocal good\r\neffects attended his new attempts at removing cataract. I was\r\nunwilling to go to him, cherished no hope of my own case, and\r\nconsidered this calamity as the appointment of Providence,\r\nconcerning which I had but one wish—that of submitting to it with\r\nthe most unaffected resignation. But the persuasions of my friends,\r\nmore sanguine than myself, and the high reputation of Mr. Adams at\r\nlength prevailed, and a day was appointed finally to decide my\r\nstate—to give some expectation of recovery or to destroy all hope.\r\n\r\nThe feelings of the mind may be subdued, but they cannot be\r\ndestroyed. From the reluctance I showed to name the day even after\r\nresolving to go, the dread of hearing my doom, and the natural\r\ndesire to enjoy a little longer the precious glimmering of hope, may\r\nbe inferred. At length the long-wished-for dreaded morning came. The\r\nsun shone brightly as I walked to the house; I felt its warmth, and\r\nthe thought that perhaps his light may still, ere long, ‘revisit\r\nthese sad eyes,’ lent new interest to his cheering beams.\r\n\r\nThe man who has never had his mind enlivened and his senses cheered\r\nby contemplating the scenes of nature or the employment of his\r\nfellow creatures, would feel much less at the thought of learning\r\nwhether this would ever be his fate or not, than he who, once having\r\nfelt in every variety the extent of the blessing, loses it, learns\r\nby experience the sadness of the contrast, and goes with a throbbing\r\nheart to enquire if any hope exists of again enjoying that power he\r\nwould gladly forfeit all his possessions to recover.\r\n\r\nI was shown into a room, where I waited a few minutes (they were\r\npainful ones), and Mr. Adams appeared. ‘I wish, sir, to be informed\r\nwhat is the state of my eyes,’ looking very attentively at him. ‘You\r\nhave not, sir, undergone an extraction for cataract?’[244] ‘That you\r\nmust decide.’ ‘Why, yes, and I fear unsuccessfully.’ ‘Is there any\r\nhope of recovery?’ Mr. Adams started, and looked down with evident\r\nmarks of bitter disappointment the first instant he saw me. ‘I\r\ngrieve, sir, to say that the eye itself is destroyed, the cornea\r\ngone, and there has been such an excessive discharge of the vitreous\r\nhumour, that the coats are collapsed.’ ‘No chance, then, of course?’\r\n‘I fear, sir, _none_;’ then, after a pause, ‘I believe I am\r\naddressing Mr. A. Young?’ I bowed. ‘I have heard your case\r\ndifferently reported; it was the subject of much conversation, and\r\nexcited unenviable interest last spring when it happened, and I had\r\nhoped that it would have been possible to relieve you, but I now see\r\nthe contrary.’ ‘I am much obliged to you, sir, good morning,’ I\r\nreplied, and came away.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams was a young man, his aspect was pleasing and intelligent,\r\nand there was a sorrowful look when I departed that well became the\r\nsad occasion. There were two things worth repeating on that morning,\r\none was his liberality in clearing his brother professor from the\r\ncharacter of _carelesness_, which he endeavoured to do. I complained\r\nthat I was sure I could not have been well prepared. But Mr. Adams\r\nreplied that preparation was _not_ necessary for extraction, that\r\npeople of the worst habits had been treated in that way with no\r\npreparation and complete success; that the fault was not of the\r\noperator, but of the operation, which must always be liable to\r\nfailure. Mr. Adams’ own method of removing cataract was not this\r\nill-fated scheme of extraction. The second remark is this. It had\r\nbecome much the custom to use hot water for the eyes when weak or\r\ninflamed. The author of this memoir had been afflicted with a\r\ntransient indisposition of them, and on application to Phipps, hot\r\nwater had been recommended and used for a twelvemonth without\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams, on being questioned with regard to the expedience of its\r\ncontinuance, decidedly answered, that by increasing the relaxation,\r\nhot water would only augment the disease; prescribed the frequent\r\nuse of the _citrine ointment_[245] (to be had at any druggist’s) and\r\n_cold_ water constantly. On the way home, I was for a few moments\r\ndepressed. ‘How happy,’ I cried, ‘are those beings who can see; no\r\none can tell the misery of blindness, the dark gloom over that mind\r\nnever cheered by the light of the sun, especially now with me, who\r\nam certain never to see again. If it were not for religion, I should\r\nwish to be the poor man who is to be hanged next Monday; but, thank\r\nGod, I can consider the whole affair as His appointment, intended\r\nnot for a curse but a blessing, and can reconcile my mind to it\r\ncompletely as His will. You will see,’ I added after a pause\r\n[presumably addressing Mr. Adams], smiling, ‘I shall be as cheerful\r\nand happy as ever,’ and so I was.\r\n\r\n_1814._—This year I paid much attention to the ‘Elements.’\r\n\r\nMy son came from Russia.\r\n\r\n_1815._—Arthur, Jane, and myself went post to London the last day of\r\nJanuary, Mary remained at Bradfield with Mrs. Young, who was unable\r\nto move.\r\n\r\nAbout this time ‘Baxteriana’[246] was published. Through the\r\nfollowing spring I was, at various times, too apt to fall into\r\nreflections which tended, more than they ought to have done, to\r\ndiscontent; but in thirteen weeks to the present day I have not once\r\nentered the doors of any other person than those of Mr. Wilberforce,\r\nand I have not dined once with him, having been only at breakfast\r\nfor the pleasure of hearing his Exposition and Prayer; for the\r\nconversation at and after breakfast has been entirely desultory, and\r\nnot once on any religious question. And as to any Christian calling\r\non me, John Babbington, from Peterborough, once breakfasted here,\r\nand is, I believe, never in town without calling. Mrs. Strachey, who\r\nwas in town a month, was so kind as to call three or four times;\r\nMrs. John Wayland twice, and here, I think, except Miss\r\nFrancis,[247] dining once a week, is the whole amount of my\r\ncommunication with those whose conversation would please me.\r\n\r\nIt would be natural to suppose that a poor old blind man who,\r\nthrough the blessing of God, retains his health and strength might\r\nhave received something more of friendly attention than this, but\r\nsuch discontent should be banished, for let me not a single moment\r\nforget the great mercies of God to me; and while many are on beds of\r\ntorment from dreadful diseases, I am free from bodily pain. These\r\nare points that should give a perpetual spring of gratitude in my\r\nbosom, and if the neglect which I have been apt to think of too much\r\nturns my attention more to the Lord Jesus, it is a benefit and not a\r\nmisfortune. Let me only take care to be looking unto Jesus, and then\r\nI shall esteem, in the manner it deserves, all that the world can do\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nMonday, March 6, most execrable riots began in London, on account of\r\nthe Corn Bill, then in the House of Commons, attended with\r\ncircumstances proving decisively the abominable effects\r\n(sufficiently proved before) of printing in all the newspapers those\r\nviolent and mischievous speeches which are made as much to the\r\nGallery as to the House, and can be intended for nothing else but to\r\ninflame the people, which they have done to a degree of desperation.\r\nPetitions from a multitude of cities and towns pour in to the Houses\r\nevery day they meet, and, in fact, the prayer of them all is to beg\r\nthat they, the petitioners, may be starved, which would probably be\r\nthe result of granting their desire. 600,000 qrs. of French wheat of\r\nan excellent quality have been poured into our markets to meet a\r\ncrop generally mildewed; this has reduced the price on an average of\r\nthe kingdom to 59_s._ per quarter, and that average taken in so\r\npreposterous a way that the real price fairly ascertained would not\r\namount to 50_s._; 90_s._ per qr. [quarter] would not pay the farmer\r\nin so bad a year. If importation was to be continued, at least half\r\nthe farmers in England would be ruined, and wheat consequently must\r\nrise in a year or two to scarcity, and if importation should be\r\nprevented, by many probable events to famine. Country labourers\r\nthroughout the kingdom are in the greatest distress, as I know from\r\nmany correspondents. For want of employment they go to the parish,\r\nbut these poor families never petition, even when starving, and a\r\nLegislature which attended not to their interest would deserve the\r\nabuse now vomited forth by towns. From thirty to forty houses at\r\nLondon have had their windows broken, many their doors forced, and\r\neverything in them destroyed; and after much mischief, with general\r\nanxiety and apprehension, the military were called forth; but it was\r\nthe last day of the week before their numbers were sufficient to\r\nsecure any tolerable tranquillity.\r\n\r\n_Monday, March 13._—I breakfasted with Mr. Wilberforce: a file of\r\nsoldiers in his house, because his servants had been violently\r\nthreatened that it should be speedily attacked.\r\n\r\nThe bawler bearing[248] last week, in the House, read a denunciation\r\nin a petition from Carlisle against the Board of Agriculture, which\r\nmade it necessary for me to hire a bedchamber elsewhere, as\r\nblindness would not permit an escape by the roof of the house.\r\n\r\nI wrote to Mr. Vansittart, transcribing a resolution of the\r\nCommittee of 1774, proposing to lay the millers under an assize. The\r\nBill for that purpose passed the Commons, but was lost in the Lords.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Vansittart’s answer to me, he mentioned the difficulties in\r\nthe way, but observed that as Mr. Franklin Lewis had taken up the\r\nbusiness of bread and flour in the House, he would mention to him\r\nwhat I proposed. From Lord Sidmouth’s speech it seems they intend to\r\nremove the assize of bread, which will leave in case of scarcity the\r\nbakers without protection in case of riots, and also leave the\r\nmillers in full possession of their rascality.\r\n\r\nAt Mr. Wilberforce’s I met Miss Francis and Mr. Legh Richmond, who\r\nread to us, with Lord Calthorpe and General Macaulay, a most\r\ninteresting letter from a Russian Princess, describing her\r\nconversion to vital Christianity by Mr. Pinkerton instructing her\r\nchildren, and her translating into Russian the ‘Dairyman’s\r\nDaughter,’ and thanking Mr. Richmond for his other tracts sent her\r\nfor the same purpose. Her English extremely good, and real\r\nChristianity, with expressions of the deepest humility, breathing in\r\nevery line.\r\n\r\nThis was an eventful year, for my poor wife breathed her last after\r\na long illness, and it gives me great comfort to be informed that\r\nshe showed great marks of resignation and piety. My daughter was\r\nwith her to the last.\r\n\r\n_May 12._—A few days ago, writing to Miss Francis, I used the\r\nexpression, ‘If a Christian was to call on me it should be entered\r\nin a pocket-book with a mark of exclamation.’ Mr. Wilberforce saw\r\nthis note, and yesterday morning Mr. Pakenham called on me, and\r\nintroduced himself by saying that he came for some conversation with\r\nme, by desire of Mr. W. He was quite unknown to me, but I found that\r\nhe was the grandson of that Lord Longford with whom I was in Ireland\r\nin 1776, forty years ago, which lord was in the Navy; and the\r\npresent gentleman is also in that employment, about twenty-six or\r\ntwenty-seven years of age; his father living and an admiral. I soon\r\nfound that he was a firmly established Christian, ready to converse\r\non the good subject, which he did with good sense and no\r\ninconsiderable energy.\r\n\r\nHe is in mourning for General Pakenham, and the Duchess of\r\nWellington is his first cousin. Mentioning Miss Francis, he said he\r\nmet her twice at Mr. Wilberforce’s, and speaking in commendation of\r\nher, I told him that she was to dine with me at five o’clock, and\r\nthat it would give me much pleasure if he would meet her; this he\r\nreadily complied with, and came accordingly.\r\n\r\nI have not had so much religious conversation for an age past; and\r\nhad not Dr. Halliday from Moscow called between seven and eight,\r\nexpecting to see my son, this conversation would have been\r\nuninterrupted. I wish he had come on some other day. Remarking that\r\nI had some apprehension of the ensuing war, because we should be, in\r\nfact, fighting for the restoration of the Pope, the Jesuits, and the\r\nInquisition, Mr. P. replied, that Lord Liverpool had informed Mr.\r\nWilberforce that Bonaparte was reconciled to the Pope, pretending to\r\nbe a most dutiful son of the Church. It seems agreed by all that the\r\nfirst victory gained on either side will have most decisive\r\nconsequences. I hope I shall hear more of this young man, whose\r\ndetermined avowal of his religious principles pleases me much.\r\n\r\n_May 15._—Breakfasted at Mr. Wilberforce’s. General Macaulay there;\r\nhe told me that in his late tour in France, travelling from Lyons to\r\nGeneva, he met with a Monsieur Michaud, who, speaking much of his\r\nfarm and offering to show it, the general accompanied him to view\r\nit, and found everything in the highest state of management, and so\r\nmuch superior to all the rest of the country, that he enquired into\r\nthe origin of such great superiority. The answer was, ‘My\r\ncultivation is entirely that of Monsieur Arthur Young, whose\r\nrecommendations I have carried into practice with the success you\r\nsee.’\r\n\r\nMuch conversation about Bonaparte; the general is well persuaded\r\nthat the allies will be entirely successful, as B. is, and must be,\r\nvery badly provided to resist them, and that the first campaign will\r\ncarry them to Paris.\r\n\r\n_May 17._—Last night, being at West Street Chapel, Mr. Gurney, after\r\nthe sermon, came into the pew, when I told him he had not performed\r\nhis promise, by calling, on which he came home with me, and gave us\r\na long account of his life and conversion, beginning at four years\r\nold with a magpie which his father found in a nest, in a haunted\r\nwood, where he went at night in search of a reputed ghost, and which\r\nproved to be only a white pony. This magpie was, by a strange series\r\nof little events, his introduction to Drummond, the banker, and to\r\nprocuring himself a school and college education, a knowledge of\r\nseveral of the nobility, and eventually, through Lord Exeter, the\r\nappointment to the Rectory of St. Clement Danes; and all this from\r\nhaving been no more than a poor country labourer’s son, and one of\r\n_twenty-two_ children. The detail was very interesting, from being\r\nnot only well told, but, from the providence of God, clearly marked\r\nin many little circumstances, and attended by what to him were great\r\nevents. These were so remarkable as to induce him to make many\r\nmemoranda, and to think at times that they ought to be published,\r\nbut on this point he does not seem to be at all determined. I urged\r\nit strongly as a sort of duty. He is uncommonly lively and animated\r\nin conversation, and contrived to talk with little interruption,\r\nfrom drinking tea and smoking several pipes, till twelve o’clock at\r\nnight. I much hope that we shall see him often.\r\n\r\n_1816._—This was a very barren year, for the memoranda made are\r\nuncommonly few, but among them is the preparation for the\r\npublication of ‘Oweniana.’[249] The extraction from my religious\r\npapers of those published under the titles of ‘Baxteriana’ and\r\n‘Oweniana’ has greatly diminished the mass, but the remainder is\r\nconsiderable, and increases every year.\r\n\r\n_February._—Last Tuesday se’nnight Sir John Seabright, coming up to\r\nme, said: ‘Mr. Young, the Archdukes of Austria desire to be\r\nintroduced to you,’ and the Archduke John, who Seabright said was\r\nthe farmer, began a conversation on agriculture which, as many\r\npersons were around, was very short. Some days afterwards Mr.\r\nAckerman, of the Strand, called to inform me that his Imperial\r\nHighness Archduke John desired to have more conversation with me,\r\nand in three or four days he called and made many enquiries into\r\nthose points upon which, I suppose, he had most doubts, contrasting\r\nmany circumstances with the system of Austrian peasants, who, by his\r\naccount, are in general the proprietors of their little farms even\r\nto the amount of as little as three or four acres. In the\r\nconversation I took occasion to mention my son being in the Crimea,\r\nand intending to return to England by Vienna. In a most obliging\r\nmanner he desired me to write to him to tell him to be sure not to\r\npass Vienna without making himself known to him (the Archduke), as\r\nhe would show him everything worth attending to in agriculture. The\r\nconversation was in French, for he speaks no English. It is a pity\r\nthat he will go away without seeing anything of Norfolk or Suffolk.\r\n\r\nSir J. Sinclair just come from Paris. He saw Sylvestre[250] there,\r\nthe secretary to the Royal Society of Agriculture, who told him that\r\nagriculture saved his life in the Revolution. He was in prison and\r\nbrought to trial, and told that his life should be saved if he could\r\nshow that he had ever done anything really useful to the Republic.\r\nHe replied that he had unquestionably done good, for Arthur Young’s\r\n‘Travels through France’ contained much highly important\r\ninformation, and in order to spread it through the Republic in a\r\ncheap form, ‘I published a useful abridgement,’ he said, ‘which has\r\nbeen much read, and has had important effects. I was pardoned and\r\nset at liberty,’ and then, turning to Sir John, he said, ‘Tell your\r\nfriend, Mr. Young, that he was thus the means of saving my life.’\r\n\r\n_February 17._—The Board met for the first time last Tuesday, but\r\nhad no business whatever before them. I suggested the propriety of\r\nsending a circular letter throughout the kingdom, in order to\r\nascertain by facts the real state of the farming world. They\r\napproved the proposal, observing that not a moment should be lost,\r\nand I retired in order to draw out a letter with _Queries_. This\r\nthey examined and altered to their mind; it was immediately\r\ndespatched to the printer, and all the rest of the week has been\r\nemployed in drawing out lists of persons from the reports, to whom\r\nthese letters have been addressed, post paid, to the amount of\r\n12_l._, and many yet to despatch on Monday.\r\n\r\nThe replies have just begun to come in; by two valuable ones from\r\nMaxwell, near Peterborough, and from Page, of Cobham, the\r\nprobability is that much important information will be gained, and a\r\nbasis laid for a very interesting publication, but I greatly\r\nquestion whether they will permit any public use to be made of the\r\ninformation, and I suspect that it will disclose so lamentable a\r\nstate of distress, that it may prove somewhat dangerous, or, at\r\nleast, questionable to make it public. What are we to think of the\r\ninfatuation of Government in laying on a property tax at such a\r\nmoment, rather than borrow a few millions to avoid the necessity,\r\none of the great evils resulting from our Government being in all\r\nmoney matters little better than a Committee of the Bank?\r\n\r\nAnswers to the circular letter of the Board, which was despatched\r\nthroughout the kingdom the first week in February, flowed in rapidly\r\ntill about April 10, and they describe such a state of agricultural\r\nmisery and ruin as to be almost inconceivable to those who do not\r\nconnect such a defect with the utter want of circulating medium; the\r\nruin of the country banks, and the great want of confidence in those\r\nthat remain, with an issue of Bank of England notes utterly\r\ninsufficient to fill up the vacuity thus occasioned, has made the\r\nwant of money so great as to cripple every species of demand.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to pronounce what the consequence of the present\r\nruined state of agriculture will prove, but I must confess that I\r\ndread a scarcity, which must have dreadful effects, coming at a\r\nperiod when such multitudes are almost starving for want of\r\nemployment, even with such cheap bread. What must be their situation\r\nshould it be dear? To my astonishment, Government seems utterly\r\ninsensible of the danger, and has not taken one single step to\r\nprevent it, or to meet it should it come.\r\n\r\n_March._—Lord Winchilsea, who I have not seen for some time, called\r\non me yesterday and mentioned his having been long absent in France,\r\nSpain, &c. He was at Marseilles when Bonaparte landed from Elba, in\r\nProvence; every circumstance was previously arranged. Messina, at\r\nMarseilles, kept everything quiet on his left, and the [garrison?]\r\nat Grenoble was prepared to receive him; of all this there was no\r\ndoubt. Uncertain of what might be the event in France, his lordship\r\nembarked instantly for Barcelona; from thence he crossed Spain to\r\nLisbon, and throughout the whole of his Spanish journey he did not\r\npass through a town that was not in a state of ruin and desolation.\r\nHe everywhere enquired the cause, and was always told ‘that the\r\nFrench had done all the mischief,’ with many expressions of cordial\r\ndetestation. He would not have conceived a country to be in a more\r\nwretched and deplorable state.\r\n\r\n_April 24._—Miss Way and Miss Neve, daughter of the late Sir Richard\r\nNeve, both high Calvinists and constant hearers of Mr. Wilkinson,\r\ncalled on me the other day in order to converse on religion. They\r\nappear to me to be perfectly sincere, but seem wedded to the high\r\nCalvinistic notions of that preacher. Miss Way lent me two\r\nmanuscript sermons of his full of predestination, and the\r\nimpossibility of falling from grace; her sister took them in\r\nshorthand. This day Miss Neve called on me again, bringing with her\r\na Miss Johnson, another Calvinistic lady, who, being in Italy with\r\nsome relations, went to Elba to see Bonaparte, and had much\r\nconversation with him. He had told somebody, who told the Johnsons,\r\nthat he wanted to see my ‘Travels in France,’ which he had often\r\nthought of reading, but came to Elba without them. Mr. Johnson had\r\nthese ‘Travels,’ and took them with him to Elba and presented them\r\nto the Emperor, who expressed much pleasure at receiving them, and\r\nMr. Johnson afterwards heard that he had read them eagerly and with\r\nmuch approbation. His countenance indicates a steadfast, resolute,\r\ndetermined mind, and he is known to abhor all doubtful and\r\nhesitating answers that do not come immediately to the point in\r\nquestion. In the very short interview that took place he was\r\nstanding with his hands in his breeches pockets clinking the money\r\nin them; but she observed that his nails as well as his teeth were\r\ndirty. He enquired, when they were in Provence, and especially on\r\nthe coast, whether there were troops at Antibes or at Nice. This\r\nconversation took place on the Thursday, and he left the island on\r\nthe Sunday following. He asked her name, and on the reply of Helen,\r\n‘Oh! I am to be sent to St. Helena,[251] this is ominous of my\r\nvoyage.’ The interview was very short with him, but with the\r\nBertrands the conversation was rather longer.\r\n\r\nI have finished reading the first volume of ‘Gibbon’s Miscellaneous\r\nWorks,’ published by Lord Sheffield. Of mere worldly production, it\r\nis the most interesting that I have read for many years, more\r\nespecially Gibbon’s own memoirs of himself. I have been acquainted\r\nwith Lord Sheffield above forty years, and more than once met Gibbon\r\nat his house; and, if I remember rightly, the first time I was at\r\nSheffield Place, which, I think, was in 1770, being invited by him\r\non my advertising the intentions of the Eastern tour. Mr. Foster and\r\nLady Elizabeth his wife, daughter of the Earl of Bristol, were\r\nthere. I thought her a most fascinating woman—an opinion many times\r\nafterwards confirmed by often meeting her at Ickworth. I was not\r\ntherefore surprised to find such advantageous mention made of her by\r\nGibbon, but, alas! the whole volume has not one word of Christianity\r\nin it, though many which mark the infidelity of the whole gang. Lord\r\nSheffield never had a grain of religion, and his intimate\r\nconnections with Gibbon would alone account for it. Of course he\r\ntook no pains to instil it into his family, and if Mrs. Clinton and\r\nLady Stanley have any, they are not indebted for it to their father\r\nor to his friend. A great number of persons of high rank,\r\nextraordinary talents, and great celebrity thus passing in review,\r\nand all of them (Burke alone excepted) without the least suspicion\r\nof religion attaching to their characters, yield a melancholy\r\nimpression on the mind of a Christian. Nineteen in twenty of the\r\npersons mentioned are gone to their eternal state, and of what\r\naccount is it at present whether they were celebrated authors,\r\nsplendid orators, great ministers, or successful generals or\r\nadmirals? Whatever might be their worldly greatness how little are\r\nthey to be compared at present to the case of a poor Christian whose\r\nemployment was sweeping the streets! Without doubt the propriety of\r\nsuch observations depends entirely on Christianity being true; but\r\nwhat a dreadful situation is that man in whose safety is attached\r\nsolely to the falsehood of that religion. The reflection makes my\r\nblood almost run cold, and old and blind as I am, and scarcely\r\nexchanging in six weeks a single word with more than one or two\r\npersons out of my family, I feel a comfort and consolation, and I\r\nwill add a measure of happiness, not one atom of which would be\r\nfound in my bosom if I were not most perfectly convinced of the\r\nabsolute truth and importance of that blessed religion which forms\r\nthe sole enjoyment of my life.\r\n\r\n_June._—Lord Winchilsea called here and chatted with me upon\r\ncottagers’ land for cows, which he is well persuaded, and most\r\njustly, is the only remedy for the evil of poor rates.\r\n\r\n1817.—The death of the Princess Charlotte this year created the\r\ngreatest sensation ever known.\r\n\r\n1818.—On coming to London in February, five-and-twenty claims for\r\nthe premium on the [summary of] the state of the poor, the causes of\r\ntheir distress, and the means of remedying it, were received, and it\r\nafforded me continued employment for many weeks in reading and\r\ngiving a character of them. Much the greater part of the authors who\r\ndrew up these memoirs were of the same opinion as to the cause of\r\nthe national distress, attributing it to the peace having thrown a\r\nvast number of men out of employment who were in the Army or Navy,\r\nor working in the manufactures immediately supported by military\r\ndemands; and this evil concurring with a general stagnation from the\r\nfailure of a multitude of country banks, had materially affected the\r\nindustry of the whole kingdom. The remedies proposed were various,\r\nand many of them visionary; the most rational advised the issuing of\r\nExchequer Bills in payment of various sorts of public works, such as\r\ncanals, roads, harbours, fisheries, and many other employments. Such\r\nsuggestions had been proposed to Government, but unfortunately the\r\nministers in England have very rarely indeed listened to any such\r\npropositions. My friend Mr. Attwood, of Birmingham, in a work\r\npublicly addressed to me, wrote upon the subject with great ability,\r\nand most justly remarked upon dismissing at once both the Army and\r\nthe Navy, and turning such numbers loose upon the public when it was\r\nperfectly well known that they could not find employment was highly\r\nmischievous. This ought to have been done slowly and gradually, as\r\nthe expense would have been an evil far less deplorable than that\r\nwhich was insured by a contrary conduct. It was the beginning of\r\n1818 before the kingdom was decidedly found to be in a reviving\r\nstate, and in the mean time the infinite number of offences against\r\nthe peace and property of the people arose to an alarming height in\r\nevery part of the kingdom. The first week in January I received half\r\na year’s rents, and it was a great comfort to me to find that the\r\ntenants continued their regular payments without running the least\r\nin arrears, and this at a time when complaints on the non-payment of\r\nrents were very general over the greater part of the kingdom. I\r\nattributed this effect, which was very general around Bury and\r\nthrough all Suffolk, to the stability and flourishing state of our\r\ncountry banks, whose paper passed readily current, and formed a\r\nperfect contrast to the deficiencies and distress so generally felt\r\nin various other countries; nor can anything be more lamentable than\r\nfor gentlemen of small estates finding their tenants running in\r\narrears of rent.\r\n\r\nThis was much experienced in the counties of Cambridge, Huntingdon,\r\nand part of Bedford. Sir George Leeds informed me that he had farms\r\nin the former counties abandoned and lying absolutely waste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARTHUR YOUNG’S TOMB AT BRADFIELD.]\r\n\r\nHere ends the diary. Arthur Young died in Sackville Street on April\r\n20, 1820, and was buried at Bradfield. The following letter from\r\nMary Young to her brother in Russia gives some details about his\r\nlast years. The letter (undated) apparently belongs to 1818: ‘My\r\nfather talks of going to Bradfield in June with Miss Francis and Mr.\r\nSt. Croix. He is fearful lest Miss Francis (who is a granddaughter\r\nof Dr. Burney, and a daughter of Mrs. Broom by her first husband)\r\nwill join the Wilberforces at Brighton, and leave him. When at\r\nBradfield she sleeps over the servants’ hall, with a packthread tied\r\nround her wrist, and placed through the keyhole, which he pulls at\r\nfour or five times, till he awakens her, when she gets up and\r\naccompanies him in a two hours’ walk on the turnpike road to some\r\ncottage or other, and they take milk at some farmhouse; and she\r\ndistributes tracts (religious ones), and questions the people about\r\ntheir principles, and reads to them and catechises them. They return\r\nat half-past six, as that is the hour Mr. St. Croix gets up (his\r\nsecretary), who finds it quite enough to read and write two hours\r\nand a half before breakfast. After breakfast they all three adjourn\r\nto the library till one, when Mr. St. Croix takes his walk for an\r\nhour; she and my father read, or write, or walk till three. Before\r\nshe went to Bradfield, Mr. St. Croix had but one hour. She has a\r\ntable and great chair filled with books in all languages, as she\r\nreads in every language every day to keep them up—Greek, Latin,\r\nItalian, Hebrew, Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Dutch, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\n‘My father puts children to school at Cuckfield, Stanningfield, and\r\nBradfield. Every morning, summer or winter, she inspects and teaches\r\nat these schools. Every Sunday they all meet in the hall and read,\r\nand are catechised; and every Sunday night a hundred meet, when St.\r\nCroix reads a sermon and a chapter, and my father explains for an\r\nhour, after which a prayer dismisses them! Last summer they went to\r\nchurch at Acton or Ampton every Sunday, each church ten miles out\r\nand ten home, besides teaching the schools and the meeting at night\r\nin the hall.\r\n\r\n‘He has taken out a licence for the hall, as there is an assembly of\r\npeople which would have been otherwise liable to an information.\r\n\r\n‘Adieu, my dear Arthur. Are we ever to meet any more?\r\n\r\n                                           ‘Yours affectionately,\r\n                                                             ‘M. Y.’\r\n\r\nThe following is added by Mr. St. Croix:—\r\n\r\n  ‘Mr. Young’s benevolent exertions for the poor in his own and the\r\n  adjoining parishes, and constant plan for welfare and relief of\r\n  their necessities, was very beautiful, and I believe and fear very\r\n  uncommon. To women this attention is natural.\r\n\r\n  ‘H. More truly says, “Charity is the employment of a female; the\r\n  care of the poor is her profession;” but to see this extend to the\r\n  other sex, to witness the same solicitude for the distresses of\r\n  the ignorant, unextinguished by business or by ingratitude, in a\r\n  man of such activity of genius as Mr. Y., was indeed an impressive\r\n  sight. At one time he established spinning matches; a cap was the\r\n  prize, and several young girls contended for it, the best spinner\r\n  being victorious. This occasioned industry and emulation,\r\n  certainly; but even this was not without its attendant evil, and\r\n  Mr. Y. finally abandoned it, from the dread of encouraging vanity,\r\n  and appropriated the money to _winter feasts_.\r\n\r\n  ‘In this cold, unproductive season, there were amongst the poor\r\n  constant endeavours and constant failure at repletion. Every\r\n  Sunday after church a set of poor people, chiefly children, were\r\n  invited, and a plentiful dinner provided for them, Mr. Y. waiting\r\n  on them and carving himself.\r\n\r\n  ‘But this he was at last obliged to relinquish. The Sunday cooking\r\n  was certainly a grand objection; and some neighbouring ladies who\r\n  had (charity) schools remonstrated at the absence of the children,\r\n  who were crazy if they were not allowed to forsake everything in\r\n  order to attend Mr. Y.’s dinners. But another scheme, more\r\n  extensive and more useful, succeeded this—namely, the introduction\r\n  of straw-plaiting among the young cottagers.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n Abercorn, Marquis of, 347\r\n Aldworth, Richard, 72\r\n Allen, Alderman (father-in-law of Arthur Young), 32\r\n — —(son of the above), 60\r\n — Mrs., 36, 38\r\n Althorp, Lord, 313\r\n Amorette, Abate, 176\r\n Anson, Mr., 394\r\n Arblay, Madame d’, 23 _note_ 12, 32 _note_ 29, 61 _note_ 52, 100\r\n    _note_ 74, 135 _note_ 99, 196, 214, 216\r\n Arbuthnot, Mr. (son of Viscount Arbuthnot), 66, 92, 97, 98, 124\r\n Armstead, Mrs., 260\r\n Ashby, Rev.

The page given for Chapter III was ‘4’ and has been\r\nreplaced by the correct page 44.\r\n\r\nThe Index has frequent references to footnotes, mentioning the page\r\nand number on those pages. Since all footnotes have been renumbered\r\nsequentially, for uniqueness, across the text, the Index references\r\nhave been modified to reflect the new numbers.\r\n\r\nOn p. 223, Young includes a memorandum from August 21, opening with\r\na quotation mark which is never closed. Judging from the tone of the\r\nmemorandum, it is likely that it closes at the end of a long\r\nparagraph on p. 224 (see below).\r\n\r\nErrors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected,\r\nand are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\n  32.23    [I ]shall make the tea                         Added.\r\n\r\n  58.13    were the numbers ascertained.[’]               Removed.\r\n\r\n  187.30   quoted particulars o[f] yearly expenses        Restored.\r\n\r\n  211.11   ‘Last night, in[s]tead of reading              Inserted.\r\n\r\n  213.13   on the p[oli/la]ce of corn and capital         Probable.\r\n           employed\r\n\r\n  224.22   secretaryship of the Board.[’]                 Added.\r\n\r\n  284.26   dwells upon the present.[’]                    Added.\r\n\r\n  306      the study of polite letters[.]                 Added.\r\n\r\n  315.27   the same answer was [r]eturned                 Restored.\r\n\r\n  381.16   I have taken places[.]                         Added.\r\n\r\n  393.31   ‘Der Augenblick ist Ewigkeit.[’]               Added.\r\n\r\n  459.12   general anxiety and app[r]ehension             Inserted.\r\n\r\n          Transcription of Manuscript Letter after p. 188\r\n\r\nThe following is a transcription of a letter from Arthur Young to\r\nhis wife Mary.

Ville a house 3 times as big\r\nas the Angel & almost tore it in pieces: It was well furnished, but\r\nall turn’d out of windows in sight of 6 Regim.^{ts} who could not or\r\nw’d not do anything to save it. From y^t time to this moment all has\r\nbeen riot in every place I have been at. I spent a day at Schelestad\r\nwith the Ct. de la Rochefoucauld who was very civil & obliging but\r\non y^e qui vive for populace who are every where in motion At one\r\nplace I was near being knocked on the head for want of a Tiers etat\r\nCockade; and at another saved by self being an english^n. by\r\nexplaining how y^e Tiers etat p^d no taxes but the Seigneurs all in\r\nEngland; proposing to them to do the same in France, they relished\r\nthis, and believed y^t I was not a Seigneur, but an honest fellow.\r\n\r\nIn this country worse & worse—they are burning and plundering\r\nchateaus, & hunt down the Seigneurs like wild beasts—some have been\r\nshot, others hanged, and hundreds driven out of the Country &\r\nruined. You see by y^e papers I suppose that the King is at\r\nVersailles bereft of Guards power, family & all but claps and\r\nhuzzas: the Queen shut up at St Cyr; the Count d’Artois gone to\r\nSpain it is said but first to [————]; and all the Queen’s friends\r\nfled the Kingdom to escape halters. Never was such a revolution\r\nknown or heard off. The towns are every where arming the tiers etat,\r\nso it will very soon be too late for the nobility to stir in their\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nPray tell Hyde to take Care that the acre in Grav P.field y^t is to\r\nbe inclosed be well dunged & sowed with cabbage seed I ordered fr^o\r\n[——] thro Bess—with^t fail by the 20^{th}. august in fine order.\r\nWrite me how the Cabbages are, fr^o a little bed in [——] past Round\r\ngarden; How does Cooper go on? I desire that Arthur may lose no time\r\nat home, but take M^r Symonds directions when to go to C. I have not\r\nhad a L^r from him of 11 months; I suppose because I expressly\r\ndesired one once a fortnight: But nothing surprizes me that come\r\nfr^o him; Eton has I hope has done so much for his head that it\r\nleaves nothing for his heart—God send it may prove so; & y^t I have\r\nnot impoverished myself for nothing.\r\n\r\nGive my dear Bobbin a Kiss for me & tell her I shall write her a L^r\r\nnext.\r\n\r\n                                             Adieu  Y^r affect^t  AY\r\n\r\nRem^r me to y^r Mother\r\n\r\nSay nothing to Arth. ab^t writing; I had much rather have no L^r\r\nthan such as those hints bring: observe this:\r\n\r\n                           Miss Young\r\n                           Bradfield Hall\r\n                           Bury\r\n                           Suffolk\r\n                           Angleterre",
