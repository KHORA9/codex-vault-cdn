(of VI.), Lectures To Working Men, at the Museum of\r\nPractical Geology, 1863, On Darwin's work: \"Origin of Species\".\r\n\r\n\r\nby Thomas H. Huxley\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the lecture which I delivered last Monday evening, I endeavoured to\r\nsketch in a very brief manner, but as well as the time at my disposal\r\nwould permit, the present condition of organic nature, meaning by\r\nthat large title simply an indication of the great, broad, and general\r\nprinciples which are to be discovered by those who look attentively at\r\nthe phenomena of organic nature as at present displayed. The general\r\nresult of our investigations might be summed up thus: we found that the\r\nmultiplicity of the forms of animal life, great as that may be, may be\r\nreduced to a comparatively few primitive plans or types of construction;\r\nthat a further study of the development of those different forms\r\nrevealed to us that they were again reducible, until we at last brought\r\nthe infinite diversity of animal, and even vegetable life, down to the\r\nprimordial form of a single cell.\r\n\r\nWe found that our analysis of the organic world, whether animals or\r\nplants, showed, in the long run, that they might both be reduced into,\r\nand were, in fact, composed of, the same constituents. And we saw\r\nthat the plant obtained the materials constituting its substance by\r\na peculiar combination of matters belonging entirely to the inorganic\r\nworld; that, then, the animal was constantly appropriating the\r\nnitrogenous matters of the plant to its own nourishment, and returning\r\nthem back to the inorganic world, in what we spoke of as its waste; and\r\nthat finally, when the animal ceased to exist, the constituents of its\r\nbody were dissolved and transmitted to that inorganic world whence they\r\nhad been at first abstracted. Thus we saw in both the blade of grass and\r\nthe horse but the same elements differently combined and arranged. We\r\ndiscovered a continual circulation going on,--the plant drawing in the\r\nelements of inorganic nature and combining them into food for the animal\r\ncreation; the animal borrowing from the plant the matter for its own\r\nsupport, giving off during its life products which returned immediately\r\nto the inorganic world; and that, eventually, the constituent materials\r\nof the whole structure of both animals and plants were thus returned to\r\ntheir original source: there was a constant passage from one state of\r\nexistence to another, and a returning back again.\r\n\r\nLastly, when we endeavoured to form some notion of the nature of the\r\nforces exercised by living beings, we discovered that they--if\r\nnot capable of being subjected to the same minute analysis as the\r\nconstituents of those beings themselves--that they were correlative\r\nwith--that they were the equivalents of the forces of inorganic\r\nnature--that they were, in the sense in which the term is now used,\r\nconvertible with them. That was our general result.\r\n\r\nAnd now, leaving the Present, I must endeavour in the same manner to put\r\nbefore you the facts that are to be discovered in the Past history of\r\nthe living world, in the past conditions of organic nature. We have,\r\nto-night, to deal with the facts of that history--a history involving\r\nperiods of time before which our mere human records sink into utter\r\ninsignificance--a history the variety and physical magnitude of whose\r\nevents cannot even be foreshadowed by the history of human life and\r\nhuman phenomena--a history of the most varied and complex character.\r\n\r\nWe must deal with the history, then, in the first place, as we should\r\ndeal with all other histories. The historical student knows that his\r\nfirst business should be to inquire into the validity of his evidence,\r\nand the nature of the record in which the evidence is contained, that\r\nhe may be able to form a proper estimate of the correctness of the\r\nconclusions which have been drawn from that evidence. So, here, we must\r\npass, in the first place, to the consideration of a matter which may\r\nseem foreign to the question under discussion. We must dwell upon the\r\nnature of the records, and the credibility of the evidence they contain;\r\nwe must look to the completeness or incompleteness of those records\r\nthemselves, before we turn to that which they contain and reveal. The\r\nquestion of the credibility of the history, happily for us, will not\r\nrequire much consideration, for, in this history, unlike those of human\r\norigin, there can be no cavilling, no differences as to the reality and\r\ntruth of the facts of which it is made up; the facts state themselves,\r\nand are laid out clearly before us.\r\n\r\nBut, although one of the greatest difficulties of the historical student\r\nis cleared out of our path, there are other difficulties--difficulties\r\nin rightly interpreting the facts as they are presented to us--which\r\nmay be compared with the greatest difficulties of any other kinds of\r\nhistorical study.\r\n\r\nWhat is this record of the past history of the globe, and what are the\r\nquestions which are involved in an inquiry into its completeness or\r\nincompleteness? That record is composed of mud; and the question which\r\nwe have to investigate this evening resolves itself into a question\r\nof the formation of mud. You may think, perhaps, that this is a\r\nvast step--of almost from the sublime to the ridiculous--from the\r\ncontemplation of the history of the past ages of the world's existence\r\nto the consideration of the history of the formation of mud! But,\r\nin nature, there is nothing mean and unworthy of attention; there\r\nis nothing ridiculous or contemptible in any of her works; and this\r\ninquiry, you will soon see, I hope, takes us to the very root and\r\nfoundations of our subject.\r\n\r\nHow, then, is mud formed? Always, with some trifling exception, which\r\nI need not consider now--always, as the result of the action of water,\r\nwearing down and disintegrating the surface of the earth and rocks with\r\nwhich it comes in contact--pounding and grinding it down, and carrying\r\nthe particles away to places where they cease to be disturbed by this\r\nmechanical action, and where they can subside and rest. For the ocean,\r\nurged by winds, washes, as we know, a long extent of coast, and every\r\nwave, loaded as it is with particles of sand and gravel as it breaks\r\nupon the shore, does something towards the disintegrating process. And\r\nthus, slowly but surely, the hardest rocks are gradually ground down to\r\na powdery substance; and the mud thus formed, coarser or finer, as the\r\ncase may be, is carried by the rush of the tides, or currents, till it\r\nreaches the comparatively deeper parts of the ocean, in which it can\r\nsink to the bottom, that is, to parts where there is a depth of about\r\nfourteen or fifteen fathoms, a depth at which the water is, usually,\r\nnearly motionless, and in which, of course, the finer particles of this\r\ndetritus, or mud as we call it, sinks to the bottom.\r\n\r\nOr, again, if you take a river, rushing down from its mountain sources,\r\nbrawling over the stones and rocks that intersect its path, loosening,\r\nremoving, and carrying with it in its downward course the pebbles and\r\nlighter matters from its banks, it crushes and pounds down the rocks and\r\nearths in precisely the same way as the wearing action of the sea waves.\r\nThe matters forming the deposit are torn from the mountain-side and\r\nwhirled impetuously into the valley, more slowly over the plain, thence\r\ninto the estuary, and from the estuary they are swept into the sea. The\r\ncoarser and heavier fragments are obviously deposited first, that is,\r\nas soon as the current begins to lose its force by becoming amalgamated\r\nwith the stiller depths of the ocean, but the finer and lighter\r\nparticles are carried further on, and eventually deposited in a deeper\r\nand stiller portion of the ocean.\r\n\r\nIt clearly follows from this that mud gives us a chronology; for it is\r\nevident that supposing this, which I now sketch, to be the sea bottom,\r\nand supposing this to be a coast-line; from the washing action of the\r\nsea upon the rock, wearing and grinding it down into a sediment of mud,\r\nthe mud will be carried down, and at length, deposited in the deeper\r\nparts of this sea bottom, where it will form a layer; and then, while\r\nthat first layer is hardening, other mud which is coming from the same\r\nsource will, of course, be carried to the same place; and, as it is\r\nquite impossible for it to get beneath the layer already there, it\r\ndeposits itself above it, and forms another layer, and in that way you\r\ngradually have layers of mud constantly forming and hardening one above\r\nthe other, and conveying a record of time.\r\n\r\nIt is a necessary result of the operation of the law of gravitation that\r\nthe uppermost layer shall be the youngest and the lowest the oldest, and\r\nthat the different beds shall be older at any particular point or spot\r\nin exactly the ratio of their depth from the surface. So that if they\r\nwere upheaved afterwards, and you had a series of these different layers\r\nof mud, converted into sandstone, or limestone, as the case might be,\r\nyou might be sure that the bottom layer was deposited first, and that\r\nthe upper layers were formed afterwards. Here, you see, is the first\r\nstep in the history--these layers of mud give us an idea of time.\r\n\r\nThe whole surface of the earth,--I speak broadly, and leave out minor\r\nqualifications,--is made up of such layers of mud, so hard, the majority\r\nof them, that we call them rock whether limestone or sandstone, or other\r\nvarieties of rock. And, seeing that every part of the crust of the earth\r\nis made up in this way, you might think that the determination of the\r\nchronology, the fixing of the time which it has taken to form this crust\r\nis a comparatively simple matter. Take a broad average, ascertain how\r\nfast the mud is deposited upon the bottom of the sea, or in the estuary\r\nof rivers; take it to be an inch, or two, or three inches a year, or\r\nwhatever you may roughly estimate it at; then take the total thickness\r\nof the whole series of stratified rocks, which geologists estimate at\r\ntwelve or thirteen miles, or about seventy thousand feet, make a sum\r\nin short division, divide the total thickness by that of the quantity\r\ndeposited in one year, and the result will, of course, give you the\r\nnumber of years which the crust has taken to form.\r\n\r\nTruly, that looks a very simple process! It would be so except for\r\ncertain difficulties, the very first of which is that of finding how\r\nrapidly sediments are deposited; but the main difficulty--a difficulty\r\nwhich renders any certain calculations of such a matter out of the\r\nquestion--is this, the sea-bottom on which the deposit takes place is\r\ncontinually shifting.\r\n\r\nInstead of the surface of the earth being that stable, fixed thing that\r\nit is popularly believed to be, being, in common parlance, the very\r\nemblem of fixity itself, it is incessantly moving, and is, in fact,\r\nas unstable as the surface of the sea, except that its undulations are\r\ninfinitely slower and enormously higher and deeper.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the effect of this oscillation? Take the case to which\r\nI have previously referred. The finer or coarser sediments that are\r\ncarried down by the current of the river, will only be carried out a\r\ncertain distance, and eventually, as we have already seen, on reaching\r\nthe stiller part of the ocean, will be deposited at the bottom.\r\n\r\nLet C y (Fig. 4) be the sea-bottom, y D the shore, x y the sea-level,\r\nthen the coarser deposit will subside over the region B, the finer over\r\nA, while beyond A there will be no deposit at all; and, consequently, no\r\nrecord will be kept, simply because no deposit is going on. Now, suppose\r\nthat the whole land, C, D, which we have regarded as stationary, goes\r\ndown, as it does so, both A and B go further out from the shore, which\r\nwill be at y1; x1, y1, being the new sea-level. The consequence will be\r\nthat the layer of mud (A), being now, for the most part, further than\r\nthe force of the current is strong enough to convey even the finest\r\n'debris', will, of course, receive no more deposits, and having attained\r\na certain thickness will now grow no thicker.\r\n\r\nWe should be misled in taking the thickness of that layer, whenever it\r\nmay be exposed to our view, as a record of time in the manner in which\r\nwe are now regarding this subject, as it would give us only an imperfect\r\nand partial record: it would seem to represent too short a period of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig.4.]\r\n\r\nSuppose, on the other hand, that the land (C D) had gone on rising\r\nslowly and gradually--say an inch or two inches in the course of a\r\ncentury,--what would be the practical effect of that movement? Why, that\r\nthe sediment A and B which has been already deposited, would eventually\r\nbe brought nearer to the shore-level, and again subjected to the wear\r\nand tear of the sea; and directly the sea begins to act upon it, it\r\nwould of course soon cut up and carry it away, to a greater or less\r\nextent, to be re-deposited further out.\r\n\r\nWell, as there is, in all probability, not one single spot on the whole\r\nsurface of the earth, which has not been up and down in this way a great\r\nmany times, it follows that the thickness of the deposits formed at any\r\nparticular spot cannot be taken (even supposing we had at first obtained\r\ncorrect data as to the rate at which they took place) as affording\r\nreliable information as to the period of time occupied in its deposit.\r\nSo that you see it is absolutely necessary from these facts, seeing that\r\nour record entirely consists of accumulations of mud, superimposed one\r\non the other; seeing in the next place that any particular spots on\r\nwhich accumulations have occurred, have been constantly moving up and\r\ndown, and sometimes out of the reach of a deposit, and at other times\r\nits own deposit broken up and carried away, it follows that our record\r\nmust be in the highest degree imperfect, and we have hardly a trace\r\nleft of thick deposits, or any definite knowledge of the area that they\r\noccupied, in a great many cases. And mark this! That supposing even\r\nthat the whole surface of the earth had been accessible to the\r\ngeologist,--that man had had access to every part of the earth, and had\r\nmade sections of the whole, and put them all together,--even then his\r\nrecord must of necessity be imperfect.\r\n\r\nBut to how much has man really access? If you will look at this Map you\r\nwill see that it represents the proportion of the sea to the earth: this\r\ncoloured part indicates all the dry land, and this other portion is the\r\nwater. You will notice at once that the water covers three-fifths of the\r\nwhole surface of the globe, and has covered it in the same manner ever\r\nsince man has kept any record of his own observations, to say nothing of\r\nthe minute period during which he has cultivated geological inquiry.\r\nSo that three-fifths of the surface of the earth is shut out from us\r\nbecause it is under the sea. Let us look at the other two-fifths,\r\nand see what are the countries in which anything that may be termed\r\nsearching geological inquiry has been carried out: a good deal of\r\nFrance, Germany, and Great Britain and Ireland, bits of Spain, of\r\nItaly, and of Russia, have been examined, but of the whole great mass of\r\nAfrica, except parts of the southern extremity, we know next to nothing;\r\nlittle bits of India, but of the greater part of the Asiatic continent\r\nnothing; bits of the Northern American States and of Canada, but of\r\nthe greater part of the continent of North America, and in still larger\r\nproportion, of South America, nothing!\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, it follows that even with reference to that\r\nkind of imperfect information which we can possess, it is only of about\r\nthe ten-thousandth part of the accessible parts of the earth that has\r\nbeen examined properly. Therefore, it is with justice that the most\r\nthoughtful of those who are concerned in these inquiries insist\r\ncontinually upon the imperfection of the geological record; for, I\r\nrepeat, it is absolutely necessary, from the nature of things, that\r\nthat record should be of the most fragmentary and imperfect character.\r\nUnfortunately this circumstance has been constantly forgotten. Men of\r\nscience, like young colts in a fresh pasture, are apt to be exhilarated\r\non being turned into a new field of inquiry, to go off at a hand-gallop,\r\nin total disregard of hedges and ditches, losing sight of the real\r\nlimitation of their inquiries, and to forget the extreme imperfection of\r\nwhat is really known. Geologists have imagined that they could tell us\r\nwhat was going on at all parts of the earth's surface during a given\r\nepoch; they have talked of this deposit being contemporaneous with\r\nthat deposit, until, from our little local histories of the changes at\r\nlimited spots of the earth's surface, they have constructed a universal\r\nhistory of the globe as full of wonders and portents as any other story\r\nof antiquity.\r\n\r\nBut what does this attempt to construct a universal history of the globe\r\nimply? It implies that we shall not only have a precise knowledge of the\r\nevents which have occurred at any particular point, but that we shall\r\nbe able to say what events, at any one spot, took place at the same time\r\nwith those at other spots.\r\n\r\nLet us see how far that is in the nature of things practicable. Suppose\r\nthat here I make a section of the Lake of Killarney, and here the\r\nsection of another lake--that of Loch Lomond in Scotland for instance.\r\nThe rivers that flow into them are constantly carrying down deposits of\r\nmud, and beds, or strata, are being as constantly formed, one above the\r\nother, at the bottom of those lakes. Now, there is not a shadow of\r\ndoubt that in these two lakes the lower beds are all older than the\r\nupper--there is no doubt about that; but what does 'this' tell us about\r\nthe age of any given bed in Loch Lomond, as compared with that of any\r\ngiven bed in the Lake of Killarney? It is, indeed, obvious that if\r\nany two sets of deposits are separated and discontinuous, there is\r\nabsolutely no means whatever given you by the nature of the deposit of\r\nsaying whether one is much younger or older than the other; but you may\r\nsay, as many have said and think, that the case is very much altered if\r\nthe beds which we are comparing are continuous. Suppose two beds of mud\r\nhardened into rock,--A and B-are seen in section. (Fig. 5.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nWell, you say, it is admitted that the lowermost bed is always the\r\nolder. Very well; B, therefore, is older than A. No doubt, 'as a whole',\r\nit is so; or if any parts of the two beds which are in the same vertical\r\nline are compared, it is so. But suppose you take what seems a very\r\nnatural step further, and say that the part 'a' of the bed A is younger\r\nthan the part 'b' of the bed B. Is this sound reasoning? If you find any\r\nrecord of changes taking place at 'b', did they occur before any events\r\nwhich took place while 'a' was being deposited? It looks all very plain\r\nsailing, indeed, to say that they did; and yet there is no proof of\r\nanything of the kind. As the former Director of this Institution, Sir\r\nH. De la Beche, long ago showed, this reasoning may involve an entire\r\nfallacy. It is extremely possible that 'a' may have been deposited ages\r\nbefore 'b'. It is very easy to understand how that can be. To return\r\nto Fig. 4; when A and B were deposited, they were 'substantially'\r\ncontemporaneous; A being simply the finer deposit, and B the coarser\r\nof the same detritus or waste of land. Now suppose that that sea-bottom\r\ngoes down (as shown in Fig. 4), so that the first deposit is carried\r\nno farther than 'a', forming the bed Al, and the coarse no farther\r\nthan 'b', forming the bed B1, the result will be the formation of two\r\ncontinuous beds, one of fine sediment (A A1) over-lapping another of\r\ncoarse sediment (B B1). Now suppose the whole sea-bottom is raised up,\r\nand a section exposed about the point Al; no doubt, 'at this spot', the\r\nupper bed is younger than the lower. But we should obviously greatly err\r\nif we concluded that the mass of the upper bed at A was younger than\r\nthe lower bed at B; for we have just seen that they are contemporaneous\r\ndeposits. Still more should we be in error if we supposed the upper bed\r\nat A to be younger than the continuation of the lower bed at Bl; for\r\nA was deposited long before B1. In fine, if, instead of comparing\r\nimmediately adjacent parts of two beds, one of which lies upon another,\r\nwe compare distant parts, it is quite possible that the upper may be any\r\nnumber of years older than the under, and the under any number of years\r\nyounger than the upper.\r\n\r\nNow you must not suppose that I put this before you for the purpose of\r\nraising a paradoxical difficulty; the fact is, that the great mass of\r\ndeposits have taken place in sea-bottoms which are gradually sinking,\r\nand have been formed under the very conditions I am here supposing.\r\n\r\nDo not run away with the notion that this subverts the principle I\r\nlaid down at first. The error lies in extending a principle which is\r\nperfectly applicable to deposits in the same vertical line to deposits\r\nwhich are not in that relation to one another.\r\n\r\nIt is in consequence of circumstances of this kind, and of others that I\r\nmight mention to you, that our conclusions on and interpretations of\r\nthe record are really and strictly only valid so long as we confine\r\nourselves to one vertical section. I do not mean to tell you that there\r\nare no qualifying circumstances, so that, even in very considerable\r\nareas, we may safely speak of conformably superimposed beds being older\r\nor younger than others at many different points. But we can never be\r\nquite sure in coming to that conclusion, and especially we cannot\r\nbe sure if there is any break in their continuity, or any very great\r\ndistance between the points to be compared.\r\n\r\nWell now, so much for the record itself,--so much for its\r\nimperfections,--so much for the conditions to be observed in\r\ninterpreting it, and its chronological indications, the moment we pass\r\nbeyond the limits of a vertical linear section.\r\n\r\nNow let us pass from the record to that which it contains,--from the\r\nbook itself to the writing and the figures on its pages. This writing\r\nand these figures consist of remains of animals and plants which, in the\r\ngreat majority of cases, have lived and died in the very spot in which\r\nwe now find them, or at least in the immediate vicinity. You must all of\r\nyou be aware--and I referred to the fact in my last lecture--that there\r\nare vast numbers of creatures living at the bottom of the sea. These\r\ncreatures, like all others, sooner or later die, and their shells and\r\nhard parts lie at the bottom; and then the fine mud which is being\r\nconstantly brought down by rivers and the action of the wear and tear of\r\nthe sea, covers them over and protects them from any further change\r\nor alteration; and, of course, as in process of time the mud becomes\r\nhardened and solidified, the shells of these animals are preserved\r\nand firmly imbedded in the limestone or sandstone which is being thus\r\nformed. You may see in the galleries of the Museum up stairs specimens\r\nof limestones in which such fossil remains of existing animals are\r\nimbedded. There are some specimens in which turtles' eggs have been\r\nimbedded in calcareous sand, and before the sun had hatched the young\r\nturtles, they became covered over with calcareous mud, and thus have\r\nbeen preserved and fossilized.\r\n\r\nNot only does this process of imbedding and fossilization occur with\r\nmarine and other aquatic animals and plants, but it affects those land\r\nanimals and plants which are drifted away to sea, or become buried in\r\nbogs or morasses; and the animals which have been trodden down by their\r\nfellows and crushed in the mud at the river's bank, as the herd have\r\ncome to drink. In any of these cases, the organisms may be crushed or be\r\nmutilated, before or after putrefaction, in such a manner that perhaps\r\nonly a part will be left in the form in which it reaches us. It is,\r\nindeed, a most remarkable fact, that it is quite an exceptional case\r\nto find a skeleton of any one of all the thousands of wild land animals\r\nthat we know are constantly being killed, or dying in the course of\r\nnature: they are preyed on and devoured by other animals or die in\r\nplaces where their bodies are not afterwards protected by mud. There are\r\nother animals existing in the sea, the shells of which form exceedingly\r\nlarge deposits. You are probably aware that before the attempt was made\r\nto lay the Atlantic telegraphic cable, the Government employed vessels\r\nin making a series of very careful observations and soundings of the\r\nbottom of the Atlantic; and although, as we must all regret, up to the\r\npresent time that project has not succeeded, we have the satisfaction\r\nof knowing that it yielded some most remarkable results to science.\r\nThe Atlantic Ocean had to be sounded right across, to depths of several\r\nmiles in some places, and the nature of its bottom was carefully\r\nascertained. Well, now, a space of about 1,000 miles wide from east to\r\nwest, and I do not exactly know how many from north to south, but at\r\nany rate 600 or 700 miles, was carefully examined, and it was found that\r\nover the whole of that immense area an excessively fine chalky mud is\r\nbeing deposited; and this deposit is entirely made up of animals whose\r\nhard parts are deposited in this part of the ocean, and are doubtless\r\ngradually acquiring solidity and becoming metamorphosed into a chalky\r\nlimestone. Thus, you see, it is quite possible in this way to preserve\r\nunmistakable records of animal and vegetable life. Whenever the\r\nsea-bottom, by some of those undulations of the earth's crust that I\r\nhave referred to, becomes upheaved, and sections or borings are made,\r\nor pits are dug, then we become able to examine the contents and\r\nconstituents of these ancient sea-bottoms, and find out what manner of\r\nanimals lived at that period.\r\n\r\nNow it is a very important consideration in its bearing on the\r\ncompleteness of the record, to inquire how far the remains contained\r\nin these fossiliferous limestones are able to convey anything like an\r\naccurate or complete account of the animals which were in existence\r\nat the time of its formation. Upon that point we can form a very clear\r\njudgment, and one in which there is no possible room for any mistake.\r\nThere are of course a great number of animals--such as jelly-fishes,\r\nand other animals--without any hard parts, of which we cannot reasonably\r\nexpect to find any traces whatever: there is nothing of them to\r\npreserve. Within a very short time, you will have noticed, after they\r\nare removed from the water, they dry up to a mere nothing; certainly\r\nthey are not of a nature to leave any very visible traces of their\r\nexistence on such bodies as chalk or mud. Then again, look at land\r\nanimals; it is, as I have said, a very uncommon thing to find a land\r\nanimal entire after death. Insects and other carnivorous animals very\r\nspeedily pull them to pieces, putrefaction takes place, and so, out of\r\nthe hundreds of thousands that are known to die every year, it is the\r\nrarest thing in the world to see one imbedded in such a way that its\r\nremains would be preserved for a lengthened period. Not only is this the\r\ncase, but even when animal remains have been safely imbedded, certain\r\nnatural agents may wholly destroy and remove them.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the hard parts of animals--the bones and so on--are composed\r\nchiefly of phosphate of lime and carbonate of lime. Some years ago, I\r\nhad to make an inquiry into the nature of some very curious fossils\r\nsent to me from the North of Scotland. Fossils are usually hard bony\r\nstructures that have become imbedded in the way I have described, and\r\nhave gradually acquired the nature and solidity of the body with which\r\nthey are associated; but in this case I had a series of 'holes' in some\r\npieces of rock, and nothing else. Those holes, however, had a certain\r\ndefinite shape about them, and when I got a skilful workman to make\r\ncastings of the interior of these holes, I found that they were the\r\nimpressions of the joints of a backbone and of the armour of a great\r\nreptile, twelve or more feet long. This great beast had died and got\r\nburied in the sand; the sand had gradually hardened over the bones, but\r\nremained porous. Water had trickled through it, and that water being\r\nprobably charged with a superfluity of carbonic acid, had dissolved all\r\nthe phosphate and carbonate of lime, and the bones themselves had thus\r\ndecayed and entirely disappeared; but as the sandstone happened to have\r\nconsolidated by that time, the precise shape of the bones was retained.\r\nIf that sandstone had remained soft a little longer, we should have\r\nknown nothing whatsoever of the existence of the reptile whose bones it\r\nhad encased.\r\n\r\nHow certain it is that a vast number of animals which have existed\r\nat one period on this earth have entirely perished, and left no trace\r\nwhatever of their forms, may be proved to you by other considerations.\r\nThere are large tracts of sandstone in various parts of the world, in\r\nwhich nobody has yet found anything but footsteps. Not a bone of any\r\ndescription, but an enormous number of traces of footsteps. There is no\r\nquestion about them. There is a whole valley in Connecticut covered with\r\nthese footsteps, and not a single fragment of the animals which made\r\nthem has yet been found. Let me mention another case while upon that\r\nmatter, which is even more surprising than those to which I have yet\r\nreferred. There is a limestone formation near Oxford, at a place called\r\nStonesfield, which has yielded the remains of certain very interesting\r\nmammalian animals, and up to this time, if I recollect rightly, there\r\nhave been found seven specimens of its lower jaws, and not a bit of\r\nanything else, neither limb-bones nor skull, or any part whatever; not\r\na fragment of the whole system! Of course, it would be preposterous\r\nto imagine that the beasts had nothing else but a lower jaw!\r\nThe probability is, as Dr. Buckland showed, as the result of his\r\nobservations on dead dogs in the river Thames, that the lower jaw, not\r\nbeing secured by very firm ligaments to the bones of the head, and being\r\na weighty affair, would easily be knocked off, or might drop away from\r\nthe body as it floated in water in a state of decomposition. The jaw\r\nwould thus be deposited immediately, while the rest of the body would\r\nfloat and drift away altogether, ultimately reaching the sea, and\r\nperhaps becoming destroyed. The jaw becomes covered up and preserved\r\nin the river silt, and thus it comes that we have such a curious\r\ncircumstance as that of the lower jaws in the Stonesfield slates. So\r\nthat, you see, faulty as these layers of stone in the earth's crust\r\nare, defective as they necessarily are as a record, the account of\r\ncontemporaneous vital phenomena presented by them is, by the necessity\r\nof the case, infinitely more defective and fragmentary.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary that I should put all this very strongly before you,\r\nbecause, otherwise, you might have been led to think differently of the\r\ncompleteness of our knowledge by the next facts I shall state to you.\r\n\r\nThe researches of the last three-quarters of a century have, in truth,\r\nrevealed a wonderful richness of organic life in those rocks. Certainly\r\nnot fewer than thirty or forty thousand different species of fossils\r\nhave been discovered. You have no more ground for doubting that these\r\ncreatures really lived and died at or near the places in which we find\r\nthem than you have for like scepticism about a shell on the sea-shore.\r\nThe evidence is as good in the one case as in the other.\r\n\r\nOur next business is to look at the general character of these fossil\r\nremains, and it is a subject which it will be requisite to consider\r\ncarefully; and the first point for us is to examine how much the\r\nextinct 'Flora' and 'Fauna' as a 'whole'--disregarding altogether\r\nthe 'succession' of their constituents, of which I shall speak\r\nafterwards--differ from the 'Flora' and 'Fauna' of the present day;--how\r\nfar they differ in what we 'do' know about them, leaving altogether out\r\nof consideration speculations based upon what we 'do not' know.\r\n\r\nI strongly imagine that if it were not for the peculiar appearance that\r\nfossilised animals have, any of you might readily walk through a museum\r\nwhich contains fossil remains mixed up with those of the present forms\r\nof life, and I doubt very much whether your uninstructed eyes would\r\nlead you to see any vast or wonderful difference between the two. If\r\nyou looked closely, you would notice, in the first place, a great many\r\nthings very like animals with which you are acquainted now: you would\r\nsee differences of shape and proportion, but on the whole a close\r\nsimilarity.\r\n\r\nI explained what I meant by ORDERS the other day, when I described the\r\nanimal kingdom as being divided in sub-kingdoms, classes and orders. If\r\nyou divide the animal kingdom into orders, you will find that there are\r\nabout one hundred and twenty. The number may vary on one side or the\r\nother, but this is a fair estimate. That is the sum total of the orders\r\nof all the animals which we know now, and which have been known in past\r\ntimes, and left remains behind.\r\n\r\nNow, how many of those are absolutely extinct? That is to say, how many\r\nof these orders of animals have lived at a former period of the world's\r\nhistory, but have at present no representatives? That is the sense in\r\nwhich I meant to use the word \"extinct.\" I mean that those animals did\r\nlive on this earth at one time, but have left no one of their kind\r\nwith us at the present moment. So that estimating the number of extinct\r\nanimals is a sort of way of comparing the past creation as a whole with\r\nthe present as a whole. Among the mammalia and birds there are none\r\nextinct; but when we come to the reptiles there is a most wonderful\r\nthing: out of the eight orders, or thereabouts, which you can make among\r\nreptiles, one-half are extinct. These diagrams of the plesiosaurus,\r\nthe ichthyosaurus, the pterodactyle, give you a notion of some of these\r\nextinct reptiles. And here is a cast of the pterodactyle and bones of\r\nthe ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus, just as fresh as if it had been\r\nrecently dug up in a churchyard. Thus, in the reptile class, there are\r\nno less than half of the orders which are absolutely extinct. If we turn\r\nto the 'Amphibia', there was one extinct order, the Labyrinthodonts,\r\ntypified by the large salamander-like beast shown in this diagram.\r\n\r\nNo order of fishes is known to be extinct. Every fish that we find in\r\nthe strata--to which I have been referring--can be identified and placed\r\nin one of the orders which exist at the present day. There is not known\r\nto be a single ordinal form of insect extinct. There are only two orders\r\nextinct among the 'Crustacea'. There is not known to be an extinct order\r\nof these creatures, the parasitic and other worms; but there are\r\ntwo, not to say three, absolutely extinct orders of this class, the\r\n'Echinodermata'; out of all the orders of the 'Coelenterata' and\r\n'Protozoa' only one, the Rugose Corals.\r\n\r\nSo that, you see, out of somewhere about 120 orders of animals, taking\r\nthem altogether, you will not, at the outside estimate, find above ten\r\nor a dozen extinct. Summing up all the orders of animals which have left\r\nremains behind them, you will not find above ten or a dozen which cannot\r\nbe arranged with those of the present day; that is to say, that the\r\ndifference does not amount to much more than ten per cent.: and the\r\nproportion of extinct orders of plants is still smaller. I think that\r\nthat is a very astounding, a most astonishing fact, seeing the enormous\r\nepochs of time which have elapsed during the constitution of the surface\r\nof the earth as it at present exists; it is, indeed, a most astounding\r\nthing that the proportion of extinct ordinal types should be so\r\nexceedingly small.\r\n\r\nBut now, there is another point of view in which we must look at this\r\npast creation. Suppose that we were to sink a vertical pit through the\r\nfloor beneath us, and that I could succeed in making a section right\r\nthrough in the direction of New Zealand, I should find in each of the\r\ndifferent beds through which I passed the remains of animals which I\r\nshould find in that stratum and not in the others. First, I should come\r\nupon beds of gravel or drift containing the bones of large animals, such\r\nas the elephant, rhinoceros, and cave tiger. Rather curious things to\r\nfall across in Piccadilly! If I should dig lower still, I should come\r\nupon a bed of what we call the London clay, and in this, as you will see\r\nin our galleries upstairs, are found remains of strange cattle, remains\r\nof turtles, palms, and large tropical fruits; with shell-fish such as\r\nyou see the like of now only in tropical regions. If I went below\r\nthat, I should come upon the chalk, and there I should find something\r\naltogether different, the remains of ichthyosauri and pterodactyles, and\r\nammonites, and so forth.\r\n\r\nI do not know what Mr. Godwin Austin would say comes next, but probably\r\nrocks containing more ammonites, and more ichthyosauri and plesiosauri,\r\nwith a vast number of other things; and under that I should meet with\r\nyet older rocks, containing numbers of strange shells and fishes; and in\r\nthus passing from the surface to the lowest depths of the earth's crust,\r\nthe forms of animal life and vegetable life which I should meet with\r\nin the successive beds would, looking at them broadly, be the more\r\ndifferent the further that I went down. Or, in other words, inasmuch\r\nas we started with the clear principle, that in a series of\r\nnaturally-disposed mud beds the lowest are the oldest, we should come\r\nto this result, that the further we go back in time the more difference\r\nexists between the animal and vegetable life of an epoch and that which\r\nnow exists. That was the conclusion to which I wished to bring you at\r\nthe end of this Lecture.",
