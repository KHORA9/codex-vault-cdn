JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Handbook, being prepared for the use of the members of the British\r\nAssociation, at their meeting in Birmingham, in 1886, it is deemed\r\ndesirable to preface it by a very brief sketch of the progress of the\r\ntown since the first meeting here of the Association in 1839, a period\r\nonly three years short of half a century.\r\n\r\n=The Corporation.[1]=--When the Association met in Birmingham, on the\r\n26th of August, 1839, the Borough had recently been incorporated--the\r\nfirst meeting of the Town Council having been held on the 27th of the\r\nprevious December; but when the Council attempted to exercise the\r\npower of making a Borough Rate, the Overseers refused to levy it in\r\nconsequence of objections which had been raised to the validity of the\r\nCharter. In addition to these pecuniary difficulties, the town was just\r\nrecovering from the effects of the Chartist riots, in the Bull Ring,\r\nseven weeks before. The Corporation had not the control of a single\r\npoliceman or constable, and the town was in charge of a body of London\r\npolice.\r\n\r\nThe same day on which the Association met, the Royal assent was given\r\nto an Act (2 and 3 Vic., c. 88), hurriedly passed, to appoint a\r\nCommissioner of Police in the Borough for two years, and to authorise\r\nan advance of £10,000, for the purpose of organizing and paying a\r\npolice force.\r\n\r\nThe validity of the charter of incorporation was ultimately settled\r\nby a statutory confirmation (5 and 6 Vic., c. III), which received\r\nthe royal assent on the 12th of August, 1842. As a consequence, the\r\ncontrol of the police was transferred to the Watch Committee of the\r\nCorporation. At the time of the transfer the strength of the force was\r\n300 men, and the population of the borough 183,000. The population is\r\nnow about 427,000, and the police force is 550 in number, and is both\r\nefficient and adequate.\r\n\r\nThe great cost of conveying prisoners and lunatics to the County Gaol\r\nand Asylum at Warwick, and the inadequacy of both to the increasing\r\npopulation, rendered the building of a Borough Gaol and Lunatic Asylum\r\nat Winson Green a necessity, and as soon as the Corporation obtained\r\nthe control of the police the gaol was proceeded with and opened in\r\n1849. In the following year the Lunatic Asylum was opened, to which was\r\nadded, in 1882, another Asylum at Rubery Hill, near Bromsgrove.\r\n\r\nThe year 1851 is memorable in our municipal history for the vesting\r\nin the Corporation, for the first time, of complete control over the\r\nentire borough by the transfer to it of the conflicting powers and\r\njurisdictions of the other governing bodies (see pp. 18 and 19.) Up\r\nto that date the formation and maintenance of the streets, roads, and\r\nfootways of the town, the lighting and drainage, and all the other\r\nimportant work now undertaken by the Public Works Committee of the\r\nCorporation could not be dealt with in any uniform system, because\r\nsix other governing bodies or officials had statutory powers over the\r\nportions of the Borough which were outside the _parish_ of Birmingham.\r\nWith the year 1852 a new and uniform system commenced, and not an hour\r\ntoo soon, having regard to the rapid increase of the population and\r\nthe consequent multiplication of new streets and roads. The aspect\r\nof the town has been completely changed in the paving of the roads\r\nand footways, the lighting of the streets, the widening of many of\r\nthe principal thoroughfares, and the carrying into operation of a\r\ncomplete and uniform system of drainage and sewerage. To the Public\r\nWorks Committee belongs also the control of the numerous tramways which\r\nlead from the centre of the town to the suburbs in every direction,\r\nexcept the upper part of Edgbaston, the approach to which is rendered\r\ndifficult by the narrowness of Broad Street. The improved system of\r\ndrainage and sewerage brought to an issue the serious question of\r\nhow the sewage of the town was to be dealt with. From the year 1858\r\nthis had become a serious and increasing difficulty, involving the\r\nCorporation in constant and costly litigation with the neighbouring\r\nlandowners, resulting in injunctions from the Court of Chancery. In\r\n1871 a special Committee called “The Sewage Enquiry Committee” was\r\ninstituted, who recommended the course ultimately adopted, viz.:\r\nthe formation of a board representing the whole drainage area, and\r\nthe establishment of a large sewage farm at Saltley. The latter was\r\nfirst undertaken and found to be a solution of the difficulty, and\r\nin the year 1877 the other object was attained by the constitution\r\nof the “Birmingham Tame and Rea District Drainage Board,” composed\r\nof twenty-two representatives from the different governing bodies in\r\nthe drainage area, of whom twelve are elected by the Town Council of\r\nBirmingham. To this body the sewage farm has been transferred, and is\r\nnow carried on with the most beneficial result.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the passing of the Public Health Act, 1872, the\r\nBorough was constituted an Urban Sanitary District and the Council as\r\nthe Urban Sanitary Authority, set itself vigorously to the work of\r\nimproving the public health. A Borough Hospital for the treatment of\r\nsmall pox and scarlet fever was established in 1874. The Public Health\r\nAct, 1875, indirectly removed for sanitary purposes the limit on rating\r\npowers to which the Council were obliged to submit in their Act of\r\n1851. By the zealous labours of the Health Committee, and the liberal\r\napplication of the pecuniary resources placed at its command by the Act\r\nof 1875, the death rate has been reduced from 24.8 per 1,000 in 1874 to\r\n19.1 in 1885, although the mean density of the population has increased\r\nin the same period 20 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 the first of the four sets of public baths was opened in Kent\r\nStreet, followed by other sets in Woodcock Street (1860), Northwood\r\nStreet (1862), and Monument Road (1883). Under the management of the\r\nsame Committee of the Council are placed the ten public parks and\r\nrecreation grounds of the Borough, of which five have been given to the\r\nCorporation and five have been acquired by purchase.

The\r\nfirst Central Lending Library and Art Gallery were opened on the 6th\r\nSept., 1865, on the occasion of the meeting of the British Association.\r\n(See for the subsequent history of the Free Libraries p. 69 _et seq._)\r\n\r\nIn 1863 the Borough Cemetery at Witton was completed. (See p. 117.)\r\n\r\nIn 1874, a Fire Brigade was established, which now consists of thirty\r\nwell-trained men, with six engines, and all suitable apparatus.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1851 to 1873 was a period of steady progress in our\r\nmunicipal affairs; but the mayoralty of the Right Hon. (then Mr.)\r\nJoseph Chamberlain, 1873-6, was signalised by the building of the\r\nCouncil House; the acquisition of the undertakings of the two Gas\r\nCompanies of the Borough, as well as that of the Waterworks Company,\r\nand the authorisation of a great scheme of street improvement of\r\nwhich the formation of Corporation Street is the principal feature.\r\nCuriously enough, the acquisition of the gas supply of the Borough\r\nhad a consequence, apparently as far removed as Tenterden steeple\r\nfrom the Goodwin Sands, viz., the provision of the present commodious\r\nArt Gallery (p. 123.) The explanation is, that under the Free\r\nLibraries Act, the Town Council had the power to appropriate the site\r\nfor the purpose of an Art Gallery, but no power to raise money to\r\nerect the building otherwise than by the penny rate, which was then\r\nhardly sufficient for the annual cost of the Free Libraries. The Gas\r\ndepartment of the Corporation requiring to build larger offices, the\r\nCouncil, at the request of the Free Libraries Committee, granted the\r\nland to the Gas Committee, on condition that they should build over\r\ntheir offices the new Art Gallery, which they have done at an estimated\r\ncost of £40,000. By this means a difficulty which seemed insuperable\r\nwas overcome. In addition to this benefit to the town, the Gas\r\nCommittee have earned for the Corporation a profit of more than £25,000\r\na year.\r\n\r\nThirty years of municipal activity, such as has been described,\r\ncommencing with the Act of 1851, of course involved repeated\r\napplications to Parliament, and in 1882 the mass of legislation was\r\nfound to be enormous, and a consolidation of twenty separate Acts was\r\neffected by the Birmingham (Corporation) Consolidation Act, 1883,\r\nwhich removed the limit of the Free Library rate, and enabled the\r\nCorporation to establish the Municipal School of Art (see p. xviii.),\r\nand to provide adequate funds for the maintenance of the Corporation\r\nArt Gallery.\r\n\r\nThus the same Corporation which, in 1839, had no revenue, nor means\r\nof obtaining any, and required to be assisted by the Government with\r\na loan of £10,000 for police purposes, in the year 1885, levied rates\r\nfor municipal purposes (exclusive of poor’s rate and the School Board\r\nrate) to the amount of £318,882, being 4s. 5d. in the pound on the\r\nannual value of the rateable property of the borough, and now borrows\r\nmoney readily at three-and-a-quarter per cent. Its revenue, and the\r\nincome received from some of the Committees, sufficed to keep the\r\noperations of the Corporation in working order, and to pay the interest\r\non £7,606,269--the aggregate amount of the liabilities on capital\r\naccount on 31st December, 1885. With reference to this large amount\r\nof indebtedness it should be noted that £2,720,061 is the capitalized\r\nvalue at twenty-five years’ purchase of the annuities granted as the\r\npurchase moneys of the Birmingham and Staffordshire Gas Company, and\r\nthe Water Works Company, and that £450,000 was paid in cash for the\r\npurchase of The Birmingham Gas Company, and also that £1,520,567 has\r\nbeen expended on the Improvement Scheme. This reduces the sum still due\r\nfor the debts of the former governing bodies and all the public works\r\nexecuted by the Corporation since 1839, to £2,915,630, and there can be\r\nno doubt that the whole of the indebtedness is more than balanced by\r\nthe value of the property belonging to the Corporation.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be noticed that the Corporation is the largest landowner\r\nin the Borough, owning more than 2,000 acres of land (including its\r\nshare of the sewage farm) and is the largest employer of labour,\r\nemploying upwards of 4,000 persons. Also that in July, 1884, Birmingham\r\nwas made an assize town; whereupon the Town Council took into immediate\r\nconsideration the necessity of building Courts for Assizes, Quarter\r\nSessions and Petty Sessions, and in July, 1886, approved of plans for\r\nthe purpose. The “New Law Courts” as they are termed, will be erected\r\nin Corporation Street.\r\n\r\n=Population.=--In the year 1839 the population of the Borough was\r\nestimated at 180,000. The following is the result of each subsequent\r\ncensus, namely:--\r\n\r\n  ------+---------+------------+-------------------\r\n   YEAR.|  HOUSES.| POPULATION.| INCREASE PER CENT.\r\n  ------+---------+------------+-------------------\r\n   1841 |  40,000 |   182,894  |     28·57\r\n   1851 |  48,894 |   232,841  |     27·30\r\n   1861 |  59,200 |   296,076  |     27·11\r\n   1871 |  74,416 |   343,787  |     16·10\r\n   1881 |  78,301 |   408,004  |     18·67\r\n  -------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe population in 1886 is estimated to be about 427,000.\r\n\r\nA still more striking example of the progress of the town is afforded\r\nby the following statement kindly prepared by Mr. S. Walliker, the\r\nenergetic and courteous Postmaster of the town.\r\n\r\nSTATEMENT SHEWING THE GROWTH OF THE BIRMINGHAM POST OFFICE DURING THE\r\nPAST 20 YEARS.\r\n\r\n  ------+----------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------+---------\r\n        |  Total   |Proportion |         |           |        |\r\n        |number of |of Letters,|         |           |        |\r\n        | Letters, |&c., to    | No. of  |  No. of   | No. of | No. of\r\n        |   &c.,   |population,|Telegraph|Money-Order| Boxes  |Officers\r\n        |delivered |or number  | Offices.| Offices.  |  for   |employed.\r\n        |  during  |of letters |         |           |Letters.|\r\n        |   the    | to each   |         |           |        |\r\n        |  year.   |individual.|         |           |        |\r\n  ------+----------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------+---------\r\n  1866  |13,023,200|  39·46    |    9    |    9      |  60    |  162\r\n  ------+----------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------+---------\r\n  1885-6|30,983,625|  72·05    |   33    |   78      | 233    |  868\r\n  ------+----------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------+---------\r\n\r\nIn 1871 (the year after the Telegraphs were transferred to the Post\r\nOffice), the number of Telegraph Messages dealt with was 1,081,825, and\r\nin 1885-6, 3,111,662. The number of Parcels dealt with in 1885-6 was\r\n2,492,689.\r\n\r\n=Gifts for public purposes.=--“More than princely, _civic_ munificence”\r\nwas a happy phrase of Professor Max Müller on the occasion of the\r\nopening of the Mason Science College, and it is certain that in\r\nproportion as the feeling of citizenship in any community becomes\r\nstrong it will manifest itself in the establishment or assistance of\r\ninstitutions for public purposes. Birmingham has never been without\r\nexamples of this kind. The earliest of the existing charities of the\r\ntown is--\r\n\r\n=Lench’s Trust=, originated by a feoffment, 11th March, 1525, by\r\nWilliam Lench, of lands in and near Birmingham to trustees. With\r\nthis trust many other smaller gifts have been incorporated, and the\r\nincome of the whole is now applied to the maintenance of four sets\r\nof almshouses for aged women, in Conybere Street, Hospital Street,\r\nLadywood Road, and Ravenhurst Street. The total number of inmates is\r\n178, and each of them has a house and four shillings a week. The income\r\nof this charity has grown with the growth of the town like that of the\r\nGrammar School (see p. 26.) In 1839 it was £758, in 1886 it is £3,085.\r\n\r\nThe next endowment in order of time was that of the Free Grammar School\r\n(see p. 26) to which has since been added one half of the endowment of\r\nMilward’s Charity (A.D. 1684). Then came--\r\n\r\n=Fentham’s Charity= (A.D. 1712), part of the revenue of which is\r\nappropriated to the maintenance of certain boys in the Blue Coat\r\nSchool, distinguished by a dark green dress.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a number of smaller charities for apprenticing\r\nboys, relieving poor widows, giving doles of bread, no important\r\npublic benefactions were bestowed for nearly a century. Almshouses in\r\nimitation of Lench’s Trust, twenty in number, were built by Joseph\r\nDowell, in Warner Street, in 1820, and another set by Mrs. Glover, in\r\nSteelhouse Lane, for thirty-six aged women, in 1832.\r\n\r\nThe last twenty years have been fruitful in gifts by our wealthier\r\ncitizens beginning with--\r\n\r\n=Evans’ Cottage Homes=, Founded in 1867, by Alfred Smith Evans (of\r\nthe then well-known firm of Evans and Askin), are six cottages at\r\nSelly Oak, of a superior kind to the ordinary almshouse, for ladies of\r\nreduced means. Each inmate is required to possess an income of £25 a\r\nyear, and receives £20 a year from the trust. Vacancies in the trustees\r\nare supplied by magistrates of the borough, appointed by the Town\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n=The Orphanage= and =Almshouses= at Erdington, completed in 1868, at\r\na cost of £60,000, by the late Sir Josiah (then Josiah) Mason, and\r\nendowed with an annual income from landed property, which in 1885\r\nproduced £6,400. The Orphanage contains upwards of 300 children, in\r\nthe proportion of two girls to one boy. The Almshouses contain 30 poor\r\nwomen. Seven of the fourteen trustees are appointed by the Town Council.\r\n\r\n=Crowley’s Orphanage.=--Thomas Crowley, a timber merchant, of\r\nBirmingham, who died 28th February, 1869, by deed dated 15th February,\r\n1869, settled £10,000 upon trusts to educate poor orphan girls. No\r\norphanage has yet been built, but temporary homes have been opened in\r\nLadywood Road.\r\n\r\n=The James’ Trust.=--The Misses Elizabeth and Emma James, by deed dated\r\n1st November, 1869, conveyed a freehold estate in Paradise Street, as\r\nan endowment for “The James’ Almhouses” they had built at Nechells for\r\naged women, to provide five annuities of £20 each for poor and decayed\r\ngentlewomen, and a scholarship of £50 a year from the Free Grammar\r\nSchool at Birmingham to the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge. The\r\nnet income is about £750 per annum, the surplus beyond £450 per annum\r\nis to be accumulated, and applied in building additional almshouses.\r\n\r\n=The Public Picture Gallery Fund= originated in a gift in the year\r\n1871, by Mr. T. Clarkson Osler (of the well-known firm of glass\r\nmanufacturers) of a sum of £3,000 for the purchase of pictures for the\r\nCorporation Art Gallery. This sum is augmented by other donations and\r\namounts subscribed, and has been the means of adorning the Art Gallery\r\nwith many valuable pictures.\r\n\r\n=Dudley Trust.=--Mr. William Dudley, a Jeweller of Birmingham, by deed\r\ndated 8th May, 1875, settled £100,000 in the hands of Trustees to be\r\nused in (1) Loans to young tradesmen at low rates of interest; (2)\r\nAnnuities to aged tradesmen, and (3) Surplus to be applied in aid of\r\nthe charitable institutions of the Borough. Four of the Trustees are to\r\nbe appointed by the Town Council.\r\n\r\n=Free Libraries.=--In order of time reference should be made to the\r\nfund of nearly £15,000 raised in 1879 to refurnish the Reference\r\nLibrary after the fire, and to the valuable gifts of books detailed at\r\np. 72 _et seq._\r\n\r\n=The Art Gallery Purchase Fund= originated in an offer of Messrs.\r\nTangye, on 3rd July, 1880, to contribute £5,000 to a fund for the\r\npurchase of examples of art for the New Art Gallery, since built by the\r\nGas Committee as previously stated (p. xiii.), and a further £5,000\r\non condition that an equal sum was raised by public subscription. The\r\nsum of £7,000 additional was raised and placed at the disposal of a\r\nSpecial Committee of the Town Council, called the “Art Gallery Purchase\r\nCommittee.”\r\n\r\n=The Mason Science College.=--For a full account of which (see p.\r\n45), was opened 1st October, 1880. Its cost was £60,000, and it is\r\nendowed with landed property producing £3,600 per annum. Of the eleven\r\nTrustees, five are appointed by the Town Council.\r\n\r\n=The Wilkes Bequest.=--Mr. Alfred Salt Wilkes, a Manufacturer in\r\nBirmingham, who died on the 29th July, 1881, left a sum of money\r\nexpected to realise £98,000 for division, after two life interests,\r\nbetween the Birmingham and Midland Institute and the General Hospital.\r\n\r\n=Municipal School of Art.=--On the 9th of November, 1881, the retiring\r\nMayor, Mr. Richard Chamberlain, announced to the Council that Miss\r\nRyland had offered £10,000, Messrs. Richard and George Tangye, another\r\n£10,000 (afterwards increased to £10,937), and Mr. Cregoe Colmore a\r\npiece of land worth £14,000 for the building of the present School of\r\nArt. The foundation stone was laid 31st March, 1884, by Mr. Richard\r\nTangye, and the building (see p. 125) finished and opened on 14th\r\nSeptember, 1885. The former School of Art, a voluntary association\r\nsupported by public subscription (and to which Miss Ryland had been a\r\ngenerous donor) being transferred to the Corporation.\r\n\r\n=The Princess Alice Orphanage=, at Chester Road, was established, 1882,\r\npartly by a donation of £10,000 by Mr. Solomon Jevons, of Birmingham.\r\n\r\n=The Lloyds’ Almshouses=, in Belgrave Road, were founded by the widow\r\nof Mr. James Lloyd, a banker, of Birmingham.\r\n\r\n=The Jaffray Suburban Hospital=, at Erdington, for the treatment of\r\nchronic and non-contagious cases in connection with the Birmingham\r\nGeneral Hospital, is the latest, but not the least of the gifts to the\r\ntown. It was built and furnished at the sole cost of Mr. John Jaffray,\r\nand opened on the 27th November, 1885.\r\n\r\nAn enumeration of these gifts would not be complete without reference\r\nto the five gifts of public parks particularised in the list at page\r\nxii.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these benefactions, mention ought to be made of the\r\nnumerous gifts of pictures, sculptures and bronzes, given to the Art\r\nGallery by our leading citizens, which will be found detailed in the\r\nArt Gallery Catalogue. Five of these gifts are deserving of special\r\nmention, namely, (1) the collection of arms given 17th August, 1876,\r\nby the Guardians of the Birmingham Proof House, and now arranged in\r\nthe south gallery; (2) the collection of pictures of David Cox given\r\nby the late J. H. Nettlefold; (3) Müller’s well known “Prayers in the\r\nDesert,” and others given by the Rt. Hon. Joseph Chamberlain; (4) a\r\ncollection of Wedgwood ware given by Messrs. Richard and George Tangye;\r\nand (5) the clock in the tower of the Art Gallery given by Mr. Follett\r\nOsler, F.R.S. Now that so admirable a gallery has been provided for\r\nthe reception of such gifts, it may be confidently hoped that others\r\nequally valuable will be constantly added by the public spirit and\r\nliberality of the citizens of Birmingham.\r\n\r\nIt is computed that the value of these and other smaller gifts for\r\npublic purposes for the last twenty years approaches, if it does not\r\nexceed, one million sterling.\r\n\r\n=Hospital Sunday and Saturday Collections.=--The suggestion of a\r\ncollection in the churches and chapels of the town on the last Sunday\r\nin October, for the medical charities was made by the Midland Counties’\r\nHerald Newspaper, October, 1859. It was warmly taken up by the then\r\nRector of Birmingham, Dr. Miller, and has been continued annually since\r\n27th October, 1859. The total sum contributed up to and including the\r\ncollection in October, 1885, is £124,433, the average for twenty-seven\r\nyears being £4,608.\r\n\r\n=Hospital Saturday Collection.=--The first Hospital Saturday\r\nCollection, designed to reach a class differing from the contributors\r\nto the Hospital Sunday Collection, took place March 15th, 1873. It has\r\ngradually grown in amount, and now produces a larger annual sum than\r\nthe Hospital Sunday Collection. The amount raised in fourteen years is\r\n£63,250, or an average of £4,517. The last collection produced £6,521.\r\n\r\n=Clubs.=--Small clubs, meeting at stated times for social purposes,\r\nwere always common in Birmingham. The Bean Club, which meets annually,\r\nhas existed since 1660. The “parlours” of the better class of public\r\nhouses were places where tradesmen used to assemble in the evenings and\r\nwere social clubs in the old sense. In 1840 the present Waterloo Rooms,\r\nnow occupied by the Midland Conservative Club, were built for a club\r\nhouse, but the time was not ripe and they were let to the Government\r\nfor the Old Bankruptcy Court.\r\n\r\nTHE UNION CLUB (non-political) was the first club in the modern sense,\r\nand was established in 1856, in rooms in Bennett’s Hill, and succeeded\r\nso well that the present club-house, at the corner of Colmore Row and\r\nNewhall Street, was built for it, and the club removed there in May,\r\n1869.\r\n\r\nTHE MIDLAND CLUB, in New Street, was established in the year 1869, and\r\nis a non-political club.\r\n\r\nTHE CONSERVATIVE CLUB was established in 1872. The present club house\r\nis in Union Street, but a larger club house in Temple Row is being\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nTHE LIBERAL CLUB was established in the year 1877, in New Street, and\r\nin November, 1885, was removed to the stately building at the corner of\r\nCongreve Street and Edmund Street.\r\n\r\nTHE REFORM CLUB was established in the year 1879, under the title of\r\nthe Junior Liberal Club. It occupies rooms in New Street.\r\n\r\nTHE MIDLAND CONSERVATIVE CLUB, which now occupies the Waterloo Rooms,\r\nin Waterloo Street, was established in the year 1882.\r\n\r\nAll the above clubs are open to members of the Association during the\r\nmeeting of 1886, on presentation of their cards of membership.\r\n\r\nFor an account of The Clef Club see page 148.\r\n\r\nOther clubs of a political, social, or scientific character are very\r\nnumerous in Birmingham.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe matters touched upon in this Introduction must be regarded as\r\nillustrative of the progress of the town in a few particulars which did\r\nnot fall within any of the divisions of Part II. of this Handbook (see\r\nTable of Contents). Fully to realize the development in every direction\r\nof our municipal, educational, ecclesiastical, literary, artistic,\r\nand industrial life, the whole of that part should be consulted. The\r\nremainder of the book will shew how assiduously various branches of\r\nscience are cultivated amongst us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I. HISTORY AND ANTIQUITIES. 1086--1800.\r\n\r\nBY SAM: TIMMINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Origin of Name.=--Eight hundred years ago the name of Birmingham first\r\nappeared in history, and almost exactly with the present name of the\r\ntown. In the famous Domesday Book (1083-1086), compiled for William\r\nthe Norman, the name is spelled “Bermingeha’,” but the varieties\r\nof spelling, from the conquest, have been remarkable. Some curious\r\ncollector has summed up one hundred and forty variations, but most\r\nof these may be resolved into two forms of pronunciation--either\r\nBirmingham or Bromicham. It is curious that no other town or village\r\nin England seems to have a similar name to that of Birmingham, and\r\nhence its etymology is somewhat obscure. Hutton’s favourite origin was\r\nBroom from the plant, Wych, a dwelling or a descent, and Ham a home,\r\nso that Bromwycham was supposed to be the original name indicating\r\nlocal details; but Hutton had forgotten to look at Domesday Book,\r\nor to explain how Bromwycham had been turned into Birmingham. Still\r\nmore, he had neglected Dugdale’s remark that while “ham,” for home,\r\nexplained the final syllable, the other two syllables certainly denoted\r\nsome personal name. All later researches have tended to confirm this\r\nsuggestion, and modern philologists, including Prof. E. A. Freeman,\r\nare almost unanimous in agreeing that “Berm,” or “Beorm,” or some\r\nsimilar form represents the name of some Saxon tribe or people, and\r\nthat Bermingham would be a patronymic or family name, with the “ing” or\r\n“iung” denoting some progeny or tribe, and giving the name to the “de\r\nBerminghams,” who flourished in the place, as Dugdale fully shows.\r\n\r\n=Early History.=--As to the ante-Norman holders, Dugdale says on\r\nthe authority of Domesday Book, that in “Edward the Confessor’s days\r\n(Birmingham was) the freehold of one Ulvvine,” but the history begins\r\nwith the Domesday Book which gives the following details:--“Richard\r\nholds of William (Fitz Ausculf) four hides in Bermingha’. The arable\r\nemploys six ploughs; one is in the demesne. There are five villeins\r\nand four bordars with two ploughs. Wood half a mile long, and four\r\nfurlongs broad. It was, and is worth 20s.” These few facts compare\r\nvery favourably with the description of other places, and show that\r\nBirmingham was then a place of some importance. No church is mentioned,\r\nand no priest, but those omissions do not necessarily prove that the\r\nplace had neither, and probably it had both. The extent of the “hide”\r\nis very uncertain and it seems to have varied from sixty to one hundred\r\nacres. This entry obviously relates to Birmingham only, and Edgbaston,\r\nAston, and other places are similarly described. This extract is merely\r\ngiven to show that some sort of town existed long before 1083-1086, and\r\nthat its name was nearly as we spell and sound it now.\r\n\r\nAfter Domesday Book a long blank occurs, except as to certain\r\ndocumentary evidence as to Fairs, (1166 and 1251), and the help given\r\nto Simon de Montfort against Henry III., by William de Bermingham. But\r\na little light is thrown on the condition of Birmingham by further\r\nexamination of a curious and unique old map of England and Scotland\r\nnow in the Bodleian Library, but which was known to Gough and included\r\nin his Topography, (Vol. I., p. 77,) with an engraving by Basire,\r\nwhich, however, is very imperfect and inaccurate. A photo-zincograph of\r\nthis ancient map was produced by the Ordnance Office in 1875, with a\r\ndescription by Mr. W. Basevi Saunders, who settles the date of the map\r\nas _circa_ 1286-1300. In this map, which is remarkably interesting but\r\nludicrously wrong in many parts, especially as to Scotland, Birmingham\r\ndistinctly appears. Cathedral cities and large churches are generally\r\nindicated, rivers are marked, and even miles on roads, while a large\r\nnumber of single houses are marked to show towns, when no names are\r\ngiven. In the portion marked “Ardene” one house, with “Brmynghā,”\r\nclearly appears between Worcester and Lichfield, and is the only town\r\nin Warwickshire which is described by name, not even Coventry or\r\nWarwick being named. This seems to show that Birmingham was a place\r\nof some importance even six hundred years ago, and that its name was\r\nthen spelled nearly as now, the abbreviations probably indicating\r\n“Bermyngham.”\r\n\r\nAs Dugdale’s Warwickshire is generally limited to the territorial and\r\nfamily history, which is difficult to condense, and rarely refers to\r\nthe existence or state of the buildings in his time, there is very\r\nlittle material for the history of the town for several centuries. He\r\nmentions, however, that Peter de Bermingham “had a Castle here which\r\nstood nearre a Bow-shoot from the Church south-westwards” (12 Henry\r\nII., 1166), doubtless on the site of Smithfield market, which had\r\nbuildings and moat till 1815. A market was granted by the same king,\r\nand on Thursdays, and was probably largely frequented and helped the\r\nprogress of the town. From this de Bermingham family, Dugdale says,\r\n“doubtless came the de Berminghams of Ireland, who settled there very\r\nantiently: perhaps in Hen. II. days on the first conquest of that realm\r\nby Ric. Strongbow:” but the family connection with Birmingham ended\r\nwith Edward and his tragic story in 1545.\r\n\r\n=The Priory.=--The Hospital or Priory of St. Thomas the Apostle has\r\nhad its name and site preserved by the names “Upper and Lower Priory,”\r\n“Minories,” &c., but the exact site of the buildings and the date of\r\nthe foundation are uncertain. The grounds occupied a large space along\r\nBull Street, Dale End, John Street, and Steelhouse Lane; but even in\r\nthe recent excavations for new streets scarcely a fragment has been\r\nfound. A century ago the pseudo-antiquarian William Hutton, who did his\r\nbest to write a History of Birmingham, records that in 1775 he removed\r\n“twenty waggon loads of old stones, great numbers of which were highly\r\nfinished in the Gothic taste; parts of porticos, windows, arches,\r\nceilings--some fluted, some ciphered, yet complete as the day they left\r\nthe chisel,” and that after letting the builders destroy the greater\r\nportion, he used some in making a fire-place in “an under-ground\r\nkitchen.” There is little hope now of finding any of these relics or\r\nof settling the site on which the Priory buildings stood. Even Dugdale\r\nfailed to find its origin, and simply records that the first mention\r\noccurs in 13 Edwd. I. (1285), and that the Commissioners of Henry VIII.\r\n(1545) valued it at £8. 8s. 10d., and that it was duly dissolved.\r\n\r\n=St. Martin’s Church.=--The Mother Church, St. Martin’s, claims\r\ngreat antiquity, but its exact date has not been found. During\r\nthe recent restoration some early wall-paintings were discovered,\r\nwith the still more valuable remains which formed part of a Norman\r\nChurch, very evidently on the same site, but all traces of whose\r\nhistory have been lost. The existing Church has, however, some highly\r\ninteresting monuments of some of the de Berminghams of the thirteenth,\r\nfourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, one in alabaster, representing an\r\necclesiastic, being well known as an almost unique example of fifteenth\r\ncentury art. The present restored church has replaced an ugly brick\r\ncasing which covered the decaying portion of an earlier church supposed\r\nto have been of the latter part of the thirteenth century with later\r\nalterations. The Registers begin in 1555, and have been carefully\r\npreserved, as well as various Church Books which have been used in the\r\nHistory of St. Martin’s by Mr. J. Thackray Bunce.\r\n\r\n=St. John’s Chapel.=--Another ecclesiastical relic, in name only, is\r\nto be found in the ugly last century brick building, St. John’s Chapel,\r\nDeritend, which has replaced the “propper chappel,” which Leland saw\r\nin 1538, an early English building among the trees by the river side.\r\nThis “chapel” was founded in 1375, by some of the inhabitants of\r\nDeritend and Bordesley, who found the floods often preventing access\r\nto their Parish Church at Aston. Thirteen of the inhabitants of the\r\nhamlets contributed the funds, and acquired the right of “appointing\r\none Chaplain” for the services, and such Chaplain is appointed to this\r\nday by the parishioners’ votes. Tradition records that John Rogers,\r\none of the early translators of the Bible, and the first Martyr of the\r\nreign of Mary, was born in Deritend near this Chapel, and a marble slab\r\nrecords his fame, but the tradition is doubtful, and has not been fully\r\nconfirmed.\r\n\r\n=The Guild of the Holy Cross=, whose Hall was on the site of the\r\npresent King Edward’s School, was founded in 6 Rich. II. (1382), for\r\nthe maintenance of two priests to celebrate service daily in the\r\nChurch of St. Martin, but ten years later was formed into a “Guild or\r\nFraternitie, consisting of men and women of Birmingham,” in the names\r\nof the “Bailiffs and Communaltie of Birmingham and other adjacent\r\nplaces, for a Chantrie of priests and services in the Church, for the\r\nsouls of the Founders and all the Fraternitie,” but in 37 Hen. VIII.\r\n(1545) the lands were valued at £31. 2s. 10d., and appropriated by the\r\nCrown, and afterwards, 5 Edw. VI. (1550), were used for the foundation\r\nof the “Free Grammar School of King Edward the Sixth, for the Education\r\nand Instruction of Children in Grammar for ever,”--the basis of the\r\npresent noble foundation, not only in New Street, but in several\r\nimportant Branch Schools.\r\n\r\n=Leland’s Description, 1538.=--Nearly half of the sixteenth century\r\nhad passed before Birmingham was visited and described by any stranger,\r\nand the visit of John Leland is a memorable landmark in the history\r\nof the town. His few words are familiar but worth quoting again, not\r\nmerely as a record, but as a contrast with the changed conditions of\r\nover three hundred years. In the reign of Henry VIII., he made his\r\nfamous journey through England, and in 1538 he visited Birmingham and\r\nrode through the town, which he describes in picturesque words:--“I\r\ncame through a pretty street or ever I entred into Bermingham towne.\r\nThis street, as I remember, is called Dirtey [Deriten]. In it dwell\r\nsmithes and cutlers, and there is a brooke [Rea] that divideth this\r\nstreet from Bermingham, and is an hamlett or member belonginge to the\r\nParish therebye. There is at the end of Dirtey a propper chappell and\r\nmansion house of tymber, hard on the rype [bank] as the brooke runneth\r\ndowne: and as I went through the ford by the [foot] bridge, the water\r\nranne downe on the right hand, and a fewe miles below goeth into Tame,\r\n_ripâ dextrâ_. * * * * The beauty of Bermigham, a good markett towne\r\nin the extreame parts of Warwike-shire, is one street going up alonge,\r\nalmost from the left ripe of the brooke up a meane hill by the length\r\nof a quarter of a mile. I saw but one Paroch Church in the towne. There\r\nbe many smiths in the towne that use to make knives and all mannour of\r\ncuttinge tooles, and many loriners that make bittes, and a great many\r\nnaylors. Soe that a great part of the towne is maintained by smithes\r\nwhoe have their iron and sea-cole out of Stafford-shire.”\r\n\r\nThis description of the town is minute and careful. The “mansion house\r\nof tymber” still remains as the Old Crown House in Deritend; and nearly\r\nopposite other half-timbered houses of the same period survive. The\r\n“propper chappell” has greatly changed its form, and the descriptions\r\nof trade are no longer strictly accurate, as some of the handicrafts\r\nare now better known at Sheffield, Walsall, and Halesowen. Some other\r\nold houses of the sixteenth century still remain, one notably in\r\nDigbeth, which has been carefully preserved; and one early sixteenth\r\ncentury house in Bull Street, near Dale End, has just been removed\r\n(1886). One remarkable change has occurred since Leland’s days; for the\r\nstreams which crossed the roads have disappeared beneath, and the pumps\r\nand wells and water courses are long since gone.\r\n\r\n=Camden’s Description, 1584.=--The visit of William Camden confirms\r\nLeland’s account, and shows considerable progress, as the town was\r\n“swarming with inhabitants and echoing with the noise of anvils,” and\r\nthe general prosperity evidently continued through the century, and\r\nfar into the next century too, for it is clear that the manufacture\r\nof swords, if not of guns and pistols, had begun and was destined to\r\nextend the fame and improve the industrial condition of the town.\r\n\r\n=Prince Rupert.=--The busy occupants of the line of road traversed by\r\nLeland and Camden had serious trouble a century later. Charles I. on\r\nhis way, in 1642, to Edge Hill had stopped at Aston Hall, which had\r\nbeen built early in the seventeenth century, and was believed to be\r\nfrom a design by Inigo Jones. Sir Thomas Holte had been true to the\r\nKing, but had become unpopular with the Birmingham people, who were on\r\nthe Parliamentary side. Aston Hall was attacked and besieged for three\r\ndays, and the traces of the cannonading still remain. In the April of\r\nthe next year, 1643, the fiery Rupert advanced to Birmingham from Camp\r\nHill, and was stopped in Deritend by the barricades and valour of the\r\npeople, but he forced his way, plundered and fired eighty houses, and\r\nleft the town on the other side after heavy losses of life and limb.\r\nClarendon has described Birmingham “as of great fame for hearty wilful\r\naffected disloyalty to the King as any town in England,” and the town\r\nhad supplied the Parliamentary army with 15,000 swords, but “Prince\r\nRupert’s Burning Cruelty to Birmingham” only intensified the opposition\r\nto the King and his cause.\r\n\r\n=A City of Refuge.=--The latter part of the seventeenth century saw\r\nmany marked advances in the prosperity of the town. The extravagances\r\nof the restoration period greatly increased the demand for many of the\r\nproducts of Birmingham ingenuity and skill. The demand for fire-arms\r\nalso encouraged and extended one of the trades which was afterwards\r\nto become one of the great industries of the town; not only so, but\r\nBirmingham had become a sort of City of Refuge for reformers of all\r\nsorts, and a sort of Free Port for many sorts of manufactures which,\r\nowing to the customs of corporate towns, were restricted elsewhere.\r\nThe “five mile,” and other acts, drove out many useful and able people\r\nand sent them to reside in a place where there was more elbow room and\r\nmore free air, and thus not only the population but the energy and\r\nusefulness of the inhabitants rapidly increased. The visits of George\r\nFox had stimulated many people, like those of Wesley a century later,\r\nand every influence, industrial, political, religious, social, seemed\r\nto continue and develop and intensify the life and progress of the town.\r\n\r\n=Early Printers and Booksellers=--The eighteenth century added but\r\nlittle to the antiquities, but much to the history of Birmingham.\r\nThe industrial developments which Leland and Camden noted made far\r\nmore rapid progress towards the end of the seventeenth century, when\r\nBirmingham became as famous for fire-arms as it had been for pikes\r\nand swords half a century before. Even that progress was, however, to\r\nbe far exceeded before the eighteenth century ended, and the almost\r\ninfinite variety of manufactures had become established. Birmingham\r\nwas, in fact, in those times, what London has since become, the centre\r\ntowards which the foremost men of the day tended for many years. In the\r\nearly years of the century, Dr. Johnson’s father came to Birmingham\r\nweekly with a small stock of books--the only supply the town seems\r\nto have had--but a few years later Thomas Warren had begun to print,\r\nnewspapers were started, and books of considerable importance were\r\npublished. Dr. Johnson’s first literary work, his translation of\r\nLobo’s Abyssinia, was dictated to Warren, but probably not printed in\r\nBirmingham, although as early as 1712, and possibly ten years sooner,\r\nbooks were printed in the town. So early as 1652 a master of the\r\nGrammar School had published a Latin Grammar--the earliest Birmingham\r\nbook--and in 1717 the first book printed in Birmingham appeared from\r\nMatthew Unwin’s press.\r\n\r\n=Early Maps and Engravings=--Thomas Warren’s first known book is\r\ndated 1728, and many important works afterwards came from his press.\r\nEngraving, as well as printing, soon became common, and many excellent\r\nexamples soon came forth. In 1731, William Westley published the\r\nfirst map or Plan of Birmingham, followed by others of great value,\r\nas Bradford’s, in 1751, and Hanson’s, in 1779; and Bradford also\r\nissued a “View of Birmingham,” of a size and quality unsurpassed in\r\nline-engraving, of which only two copies have survived. Many folio and\r\nquarto volumes appeared in the middle of the century from Thomas Aris,\r\nC. Earl, and others, and were remarkably fine productions for a midland\r\ntown a century and a half ago.\r\n\r\n=John Baskerville=--All these, however, were surpassed by the far-famed\r\nproductions of John Baskerville’s press, for his experience as a\r\ngrave-stone cutter in Moor Street, and his fine taste and restless\r\nenergy enabled him to produce type and paper, and to print in so\r\nexcellent a style, that his productions soon won European fame.\r\nAt Easy Hill--the house, in ruins, still remains--he made his own\r\npresses, type, and probably paper to some extent, and spent hundreds\r\nof pounds before he had formed letters to please his fastidious eyes\r\nand excellent taste. Birmingham has few greater claims to honour in the\r\nindustries and arts than those which have so universally been given to\r\nthe Baskerville Press.\r\n\r\n=Directories=--The later half of the century was even more\r\ndistinguished in many other ways. The modern Directories were not\r\npopular or common till late in the last century. Even the rare London\r\nDirectory of 1677 does not seem to have had many imitators, but\r\nabout 1750 the increasing number of trades stimulated the demand.\r\nIn Newcastle-on-Tyne, and in Sheffield and other towns, Directories\r\nappeared, and Birmingham was among the first, and one of great interest\r\nand value appeared in 1770, and probably earlier, followed by others,\r\never increasing as the population increased, but very curiously\r\ncontrasting with the huge volumes of later days.\r\n\r\n=Cotton Spinning=--One of the most remarkable, perhaps, of the\r\nindustrial schemes in Birmingham, was the establishment of a cotton\r\nmill, which still remains as a building and shows its origin, although\r\nnow a rolling mill. It was the natural result of the genius of John\r\nWyatt and of Lewis Paul, for in a room in the Upper Priory--now covered\r\nby the schools of the Society of Friends--the first cotton spinning\r\nmachine was erected and worked, and the old distaff and spindle, and\r\nspinning machine doomed. Thomas Warren, Edward Cave, Dr. James, and\r\nothers, took up the speculation of Lewis Paul, and mills were built\r\nat Birmingham and Northampton, but before the century closed they had\r\nfailed to pay.\r\n\r\n=The Soho Works=--The most famous of all the classes of industrial\r\nenterprises in Birmingham was the famous “Soho.” From the manufacture\r\nof “toys”--steel toys, buckles, buttons, sword-hilts, &c.--in Snow\r\nHill, Matthew Boulton had removed to Soho in 1763. There he erected\r\nmachinery for water power, but by happy accident, James Watt visited\r\nthe place, and Boulton was so struck with his improvements in the steam\r\nengine, which Soho only seemed able to produce, that a connection began\r\nwhich has immortalised the names of Boulton and Watt, and shed undying\r\nglory on the industrial history of Birmingham. The story has been too\r\noften told to require repetition, but even now it has scarcely been\r\nfully told. Soho itself has perished, scarcely a relic remains, but\r\nJames Watt’s house at Heathfield still exists with relics which will\r\never be an honour to his genius, and will keep his memory green. All\r\nadmirers of the genius of Watt will hope and desire that these remains\r\nof an industrial hero, a genius of the useful arts, may become a public\r\ntrust, to show posterity how so illustrious a man of science was valued\r\nin his life, and is honoured by those who rejoice in the fruits of his\r\ngenius and skill.\r\n\r\n=Famous Men: the Soho Circle=--One of the most remarkable chapters in\r\nthe history of Birmingham would be a full record of the men of the\r\nlatter half, or even the last quarter, of the last century who gave\r\nlustre to the town, and who materially helped its constant progress.\r\n“Soho” had not only supplied what the world had long wanted, “power,”\r\nbut it had set up a standard of excellence, and had trained a class of\r\nworkmen who were to go forth to conquer, at home and abroad, in all\r\nindustrial work. The spirit of Soho is still abroad in the land, and\r\nBirmingham may claim to have been one of the foremost in the mechanical\r\nprogress of the past hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe galaxy of great men, as it has been called, who met in Birmingham\r\na century ago is certainly remarkable. Boulton was a native of the\r\ntown, but many “strangers came within the gates.” James Watt--almost\r\nall-accomplished--was soon followed by Joseph Priestley, who lived here\r\nfor eleven years. His fame had preceded him, his great discoveries had\r\nbeen made. A storm of popular and ignorant bigotry drove him from the\r\ntown, wrecked his home, ruined his laboratory, and burned his library;\r\nbut the sons have “blushed to find their fathers were his foes;” and\r\na statue honoured his memory and his great discovery of oxygen on\r\nthe centenary of that day. Dr. Darwin, of Lichfield and Derby, the\r\nfather of a noble line, and himself a man of genius and power, was\r\na constant visitor. William Murdock, one of the ablest of the Soho\r\ngroup, the first maker of a locomotive, and the practical inventor\r\nof gas-lighting, was long a resident in the town, and is buried near\r\nBoulton and Watt. John Baskerville, the printer; Josiah Wedgwood, the\r\nfamous art-potter; James Keir, the great chemist; Richard Edgeworth and\r\nThomas Day, authors; Joseph Berington, the learned Roman Catholic; Dr.\r\nWithering, the botanist; Dr. Parr, the famous Greek scholar; Samuel\r\nGalton, the Quaker; John Proud, the Swedenborgian; John Wyatt, the\r\ninventor; Edmund Hector, Johnson’s friend; and many others, formed\r\nsuch a “happy family” of genius and worth as few towns of the period\r\ncould surpass or equal; and that “golden age” of Birmingham, the men\r\nand names, and works and progress of the last century, must ever be\r\nremembered and honoured, even in these days of quicker progress and\r\ngreater victories in scientific and industrial pursuits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Many very interesting details of the History of Birmingham are\r\nnecessarily omitted in this brief summary and may be found in the\r\nfollowing works:--\r\n\r\n  Aston Hall, (A.

THACKRAY BUNCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Local Government of Birmingham is administered by five sets of\r\nauthorities:--\r\n\r\n1. Justices of the Peace.\r\n\r\n2. Town Council.\r\n\r\n3. Drainage Board.\r\n\r\n4. Boards of Guardians.\r\n\r\n5. School Board.\r\n\r\n=Justices of the Peace.=--The first of these bodies was constituted\r\nby Royal Grant in 1838, when the town was incorporated as a municipal\r\nborough. A Court of Quarter Sessions was then next established, for\r\nthe trial of prisoners, and a Recorder was appointed. The Court of\r\nPetty Sessions for the borough was instituted at the same time, under\r\nspecial commission of the peace. The duties of the justices are to\r\nmaintain peace and order in the borough, to administer justice at petty\r\nsessions, to appoint visitors to the prison, and to grant licences for\r\npublic houses, theatres, and concert halls, and licences for music and\r\ndancing in houses kept for the sale of liquor. They are invested with\r\npowers of control over the police on occasions of actual or threatened\r\ndisturbance of public order; and any two of them, sitting in petty\r\nsessions, are empowered to suspend or dismiss any police constable for\r\nsufficient cause.\r\n\r\n=The Town Council= has charge of the general administration of the\r\naffairs of the borough; watching; lighting; making, draining, and\r\nrepairing streets and roads; the care of the public health, by the\r\nprevention and removal of nuisances, the enforcement of a system of\r\nhouse inspection, the collection and disposal of night soil and house\r\nrefuse, and the maintenance of a Borough Hospital; the control of the\r\nBorough Cemetery, (for which it acts as a Burial Board;) the provision\r\nand management of Baths and Parks; of Free Libraries, Museums, and\r\nSchools of Art; and it also has control of the manufacture and sale\r\nof Gas, and the provision of Water. The powers of the Corporation,\r\noriginally and to a limited extent conferred by Royal Charter in\r\n1838, were by degrees enlarged by twenty special local Acts or Orders\r\nsanctioned by Parliament, for various purposes. The whole of these\r\nwere, in 1883, consolidated in the Birmingham Corporation Consolidation\r\nAct, which, together with the Municipal Corporations Amendment Act of\r\n1882, and the Public Health Act of 1875, constitute the Municipal Law\r\nunder which the affairs of the Borough are administered.\r\n\r\n=The Drainage Board= is a body composed in part of representatives\r\nelected by the Town Council, and in part of representatives elected\r\nby the Local Boards of districts adjoining the Borough. There are\r\ntwenty-two members of this Board, two of them, the Mayor of Birmingham,\r\nand the Chairman of the Aston Manor Local Board being ex-officio, and\r\nthe others being elected in the following proportions: Birmingham\r\nTown Council eleven; one each from the Local Boards of Aston Manor,\r\nBalsall Heath, Handsworth, Harborne, Saltley, and Smethwick; and one\r\neach (elected by the respective Boards of Guardians) for Aston Rural\r\nDistrict and Sutton Coldfield, King’s Norton and Northfield, and Perry\r\nBarr. The Board has charge of the sewage from the districts above\r\nnamed, extending over an area of 45,000 acres. The whole of the sewers\r\nare made to converge to a common outlet at Saltley, where the sewage is\r\nreceived into tanks, and is then purified, first by precipitation, and\r\nnext by passing it through the land of the sewage farm, the effluent\r\nwater, thus rendered clear and harmless, being poured into the rivers\r\nCole and Tame. The sludge remaining in the sewage tanks is dug into\r\nthe land. For the purposes of sewage treatment the Drainage Board\r\nhas acquired about 1,200 acres of land in the Tame Valley. The Board\r\nhas borrowing powers, exercised to the extent of £400,000 for the\r\nacquisition of land and the execution of works; and it has also rating\r\npowers for the payment of interest and repayment of capital, and for\r\ncurrent expenditure. These powers are exercised by serving precepts\r\nupon the several local authorities included in the Drainage area, in\r\nproportion to the number of their rated tenements.\r\n\r\n=The Boards of Guardians= have charge of the poor law administration\r\nof the Borough. There are three parishes in the Borough, namely,\r\nBirmingham, Edgbaston, and part of Aston. The parish of Birmingham is\r\nseparately administered by a Board of Guardians, originally constituted\r\nunder a Local Act of 23 Geo. III. (1782) modified by a local Act of 1\r\nand 2 Wm. IV. (1831) and further modified by “orders” of the Poor Law\r\nBoard, and the Local Government Board; the last of these was issued\r\nin 1882. The number of Guardians for the parish is 60, and the twelve\r\noverseers (the rating authority for poor law purposes) also have seats\r\non the Board.\r\n\r\nThe parish of Edgbaston is wholly in the Borough, but it forms part\r\nof the King’s Norton Union, and as to the poor law is governed by the\r\nGuardians of that Union. The parish of Aston is only partially within\r\nthe Borough; it is administered by the Guardians of Aston Union.\r\nEdgbaston and Aston parochial affairs are governed under the general\r\npoor law Acts, there being no local Act for either parish.\r\n\r\n=The School Board=, which consists of fifteen members, was first\r\nelected in November, 1870, under the Elementary Education Act passed in\r\nthat year. It has charge of the Board Schools throughout the Borough.\r\n\r\nThe above described bodies are all of them representative, but are\r\nelected on different franchises, and by different methods.\r\n\r\nThe Town Council is elected by the votes of all occupiers in the\r\nsixteen wards in which the Borough is divided, women householders\r\nbeing entitled to vote; three Councillors being chosen for each ward,\r\nand one of the three retiring each year; and the votes being given by\r\nballot. The Drainage Board is elected by the governing authorities.\r\nThe Guardians of the Poor are chosen, in Birmingham; by ratepayers of\r\n£12 annual value, the whole Board being elected at one time, by voting\r\npapers delivered at the place of election; and in the other parishes\r\nby all occupying householders, by voting papers collected from the\r\nelectors. The School Board is elected by the votes of all householders,\r\nthe whole Board retiring at the end of three years, and the votes being\r\ntaken on the cumulative plan, each elector giving the whole of his\r\nvotes to one candidate, or dividing them in any other proportion, at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nEach of the bodies is invested with borrowing and rating powers,\r\nlimited by local or general acts. The Town Council levies rates on\r\nthe whole Borough--a Municipal or Borough Rate for general municipal\r\npurposes, under the Municipal Corporations Acts, and an Improvement\r\nRate, for purposes specified in the Local Improvement Act. The Drainage\r\nBoard and the School Board serve precepts upon the Town Council for\r\nthe amounts they respectively require, and these amounts are included\r\nin the Borough Rate. The Guardians of the Poor make rates for their\r\nrespective parishes for poor law purposes; and they collect, on behalf\r\nof the Town Council, the rates levied for municipal expenditure,\r\nincluding the money required by the Drainage Board and the School\r\nBoard. There is one assessment for local rates, made (under a recent\r\nagreement with the Town Council) by the parish overseers.\r\n\r\nThe preceding statement shortly describes the existing arrangement\r\nof local government in Birmingham; but, in order to explain the\r\ngrowth of the system now in operation, it is necessary briefly to\r\nsketch the history of local administration. Birmingham has always\r\nbeen what is called a free town, that is, until after the passing of\r\nthe Municipal Corporations Act in 1835, it had no Corporation, with a\r\nrestricted burgess roll, and consequently the community was open to\r\nall who cared to settle in the town for the purposes of residence or\r\ntrade, a circumstance which largely contributed to the rapid growth\r\nof Birmingham in population, industry, and wealth. Down to the year\r\n1769, the government of the place was controlled by the three sets\r\nof authorities existing in all non-chartered communities.--1, the\r\njustices, to keep the peace, and to punish crime. 2, the court leet\r\n(with its elected jury, its high and low bailiffs, its ale tasters,\r\nflesh connors, and leather sealers) meeting at irregular intervals,\r\nunder the direction of the Lord of the Manor, and invested with the\r\ncare of markets, nuisances, and other matters pertaining to, or\r\ninterfering with, the rights of the lord. 3, the Churchwardens, who\r\ntransacted the church and parish business, and held vestry meetings for\r\ngeneral town purposes, and for the choice of surveyors of the highways.\r\n\r\nIn 1769, an Act of Parliament was obtained, constituting a body of\r\nCommissioners for the purposes of maintaining, improving, and lighting\r\nthe town, and invested with general powers affecting the health and\r\nsafety of the inhabitants, and the common welfare. By subsequent\r\nActs--five in number, the last of these being passed in 1828--the\r\npowers of the Street Commissioners were extended, and they were\r\nauthorised by the last named Act to build a Town Hall. Their authority\r\nwas confined to what was then known as “the town of Birmingham,” the\r\nboundaries of which were co-extensive with the parish of Birmingham.\r\nThe first Commissioners were named in the Act constituting them, and\r\nvacancies were thereafter filled up by the Commissioners themselves,\r\nwithout reference to the inhabitants. The system of local government\r\nthus instituted continued unchanged until the year 1838. In 1832,\r\nBirmingham was, for the first time, under the provisions of the Reform\r\nAct, constituted a Parliamentary borough, with the right of returning\r\ntwo members to the House of Commons. The boundaries of the Borough\r\nwere so arranged as to include the parish of Birmingham, the parish of\r\nEdgbaston, and the hamlets of Deritend and Bordesley, and Duddeston\r\nand Nechells, in the parish of Aston, the area thus formed being 8,240\r\nacres. The Parliamentary Reform Act was followed by the passing of the\r\nMunicipal Corporations Act, in 1835. For a considerable time there\r\nhad been a strong feeling in favour of some completer form of local\r\ngovernment than that afforded by the Commissioners Acts, and especially\r\nfor government founded upon the representative principle. In 1837,\r\nsteps were taken to obtain a charter of incorporation for the town,\r\nunder the authority of the Municipal Corporations Act; and in October,\r\n1838, after much opposition, both locally and in Parliament, a charter\r\nwas granted, and the Corporation of Birmingham came into existence.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the new Municipal Borough were fixed so as to\r\ncorrespond with those of the Parliamentary Borough, above described.\r\nThe area was divided into thirteen wards (extended in 1873 to\r\nsixteen wards), and the Council was constituted of 16 aldermen and\r\n48 councillors. The first elections of councillors took place on the\r\n26th of December, 1838, and on the day following the Council met, and\r\nelected the aldermen, the governing body being then fully constituted.\r\nMr. William Scholefield was elected the first Mayor.\r\n\r\nAlthough Birmingham had now obtained a system of representative\r\ngovernment, the state of affairs was by no means satisfactory. In the\r\nparish of Birmingham the self-elected Commissioners of the Street Act\r\nretained their full authority, and in the district of Deritend and\r\nBordesley local government was for certain purposes still exercised by\r\na body of Commissioners constituted by an Act passed in 1791, while\r\nDuddeston and Nechells were governed by Commissioners appointed under\r\nan Act of 1829. There were consequently four governing bodies within\r\nthe borough, and the powers of the new Corporation were consequently\r\nseriously limited and its action impeded. Other difficulties of a\r\npeculiarly embarrassing character speedily developed themselves. The\r\nvalidity of the Charter was contested both in the Law Courts and in\r\nParliament; disputes arose between the Borough Magistracy and the\r\nCounty Bench; hindrances were put in the way of the Court of Quarter\r\nSessions granted for the Borough. In addition to these causes of\r\ndisquiet the occurrence of the Chartist riots of 1839 furnished a\r\npretext for withdrawing from the Corporation the right of establishing\r\na constabulary or police force for the town, and a special Police Act\r\nwas passed by which, while paid for by the ratepayers, the police force\r\nwas placed under the absolute control of a Government Commissioner. In\r\n1842 this perplexing condition of affairs was, however, brought to an\r\nend, by the passing of an Act of Parliament confirming the Charters of\r\nBirmingham and Manchester, and an Act was also passed transferring to\r\nthe Corporation of Birmingham the control of the local police force.\r\nThe powers of the Town Council, however, were still very limited, owing\r\nto the conflicting local authorities existing in the Borough, and it\r\nbecame evident in the course of time that, in the public interests, the\r\nrepresentative body must finally be made supreme. The minor bodies did\r\nnot yield without a contest, but in the end the pressure of opinion\r\novercame their resistance, and in 1851 the passing of the Birmingham\r\nImprovement Act put an end to all the bodies of Commissioners, and\r\ntransferred their powers, with others provided by the Act, to the Town\r\nCouncil, as the representative of the ratepayers of the borough, and\r\nthe Town Council became thenceforward the sole governing authority\r\nfor all municipal purposes. The Act mentioned further authorised\r\nthe borrowing of loans for purposes of town improvements and for a\r\nsystem of sewerage, and empowered the Council to levy a special rate\r\nfor such purposes, in addition to the ordinary municipal rate levied\r\nunder the Municipal Corporations Act. Ten years later, in 1861, a\r\nsecond Improvement Act invested the Corporation with further powers\r\nof administration and of borrowing; and numerous other Acts were\r\nsubsequently obtained for specific purposes. Among these were the Parks\r\nAct, 1854; an order (1873) extending to sixteen the number of Wards in\r\nthe Borough;--an Act giving the Council power to acquire closed burial\r\ngrounds and to lay them out as places of public recreation, passed\r\nin 1878; Acts for the purchase of the Gas and Water undertakings in\r\n1875; an Act for a Sanitary Improvement Scheme under the provisions of\r\nthe Artisans’ Dwellings Act, 1876; for the constitution of a Drainage\r\nBoard, in 1878; and for the issue of Corporation Stock in 1880. The\r\npowers of most of these enactments, with additional powers, were\r\nembodied in the Birmingham Corporation Consolidation Act of 1883,\r\nwhich, amongst other provisions, abolished the restriction to one penny\r\nin the pound previously imposed upon the Free Libraries Rate (under\r\nthe General Libraries Act) and authorised the Council to conduct a\r\nMunicipal School of Art.\r\n\r\nThe Consolidation Act, therefore, now constitutes the authority under\r\nwhich (in addition to the powers conferred by general municipal law)\r\nthe government of the borough is now administered. The following\r\nstatement, extracted from the “History of the Corporation of\r\nBirmingham,” explains the scope and working of the system:--\r\n\r\n“The municipal government, under the Charter of Incorporation and the\r\nActs of Parliament relating to municipal corporations, is conducted by\r\na council, consisting of forty-eight councillors and sixteen aldermen.\r\n\r\n“Three councillors are allotted to and elected by each of the sixteen\r\nwards into which the borough is divided, and each councillor is elected\r\nfor three years, the elections being so arranged that one-third of the\r\ncouncillors (one in each ward) retire every year, and elections for\r\nthe choice of their successors are held on the first of November. The\r\naldermen are chosen by the members of the Council, and are elected\r\nfor six years; they may be chosen from amongst the members of the\r\nCouncil, or from fit persons not members of the Council, but who are\r\nqualified for election to it. The Mayor is chosen by the Council, on\r\nthe ninth of November, for a term of one year. Under the Municipal\r\nCorporations Act of 1835, it was obligatory that, at the time of being\r\nelected, he should be a member of the Council; but by the Municipal\r\nCorporations Act of 1882 it is provided (sec. 15) that ‘the Mayor shall\r\nbe a fit person elected by the Council from among the aldermen or\r\ncouncillors, or persons qualified to be such.’ There is now no property\r\nqualification required for any members of the Council.\r\n\r\n“The Council, as a whole, is the rating and controlling authority\r\nfor the Borough. In all matters subjected to its authority it acts\r\nupon communications from the Mayor, upon motions made upon its own\r\ninitiative (regulated by its standing orders for the conduct of\r\nbusiness) and upon reports and proposals from the Committees it\r\nappoints, and to which it delegates specified branches of municipal\r\nwork, under such regulations and with such limitations as it may direct.\r\n\r\n“These Committees have varied from time to time; at present they\r\nare sixteen in number, and are named, constituted, and empowered as\r\nfollows, taking them in the order in which they are stated in the\r\n‘Borough of Birmingham Municipal Diary,’ issued by the Town Clerk,\r\nunder the direction of the Council:--\r\n\r\n1.--Baths and Parks Committee.--“To have charge of the public baths,\r\nparks, gardens, and recreation grounds, and the buildings thereon\r\n(excepting the recreation ground in St. Clement’s Road, in charge of\r\nthe Gas Committee, and the buildings in Adderley Park, in charge of the\r\nFree Libraries Committee); to have charge of the trees planted in the\r\nstreets; to lay out disused burial grounds acquired by the Council; and\r\nto arrange for supplies of coal and coke to the several departments of\r\nthe Corporation, excepting the Lunatic Asylum, Public Works, Gas and\r\nWater Committees.\r\n\r\n2.--Estates Committee.--“To take charge of all estates and buildings\r\nbelonging to the Corporation, not in charge of other Committees\r\n(including the Council House);

The mayor, by virtue of his office, is a member of all\r\ncommittees.\r\n\r\nThe Town Council is also invested with a share of the management of\r\nthe chief educational institutions of the town, with the exception of\r\nthe School Board. It appoints eight Governors (holding office for six\r\nyears) on the Board of King Edward the Sixth’s Grammar School; five\r\nmembers (holding office for life) on the Trust of Sir Josiah Mason’s\r\nCollege; and four Governors (appointed annually) on the Council of\r\nthe Midland Institute, the Mayor for the time being being also a\r\nGovernor of the Institute, by virtue of his office. It also appoints\r\nrepresentative Governors on the governing bodies of Lench’s Trust, and\r\nseveral other charities, and further appoints representative Guardians\r\nof the Birmingham Proof House, for the proving of fire-arms.\r\n\r\nThe progress of Birmingham since the establishment of local\r\nrepresentative government is exhibited in the following table:--\r\n\r\n                             1838.        1884.\r\n  Population                170,000      421,000\r\n  Parliamentary Elections     7,300       63,718\r\n  Burgesses                   5,023       74,167\r\n  Rateable Value           £407,000   £1,563,000\r\n  Rated Tenements            39,000       98,787\r\n  Death Rate, 1842 to 1851 yearly average, 24.96\r\n       ”      1872 ”  1881       ”         23.25\r\n       ”      1882 ”  1884       ”         21.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nBY OSMUND AIRY, M.A., H.M. INSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS FOR BIRMINGHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt can fairly be said that there is probably no town in England which\r\npossesses a more complete educational system than Birmingham. This\r\nsystem has been no effect of a pre-conceived design, but has grown up,\r\npiece by piece, in the stress of the life of a great manufacturing\r\ncentre, where people of leisure may be counted on the fingers of one\r\nhand. All the more, probably, it has been constantly and definitely\r\nadapting itself to the needs of the locality. The boast is at any rate\r\na just one, that in this busy population the road is clear, clear that\r\nis of all artificial obstructions, clearer far than in many a more\r\npolished and cultivated society, for a boy to rise from the gutter to\r\nthe University, or to eminence in any science or art.\r\n\r\n=Foundation of the Grammar School.=--King Edward’s School owes its\r\norigin to an institution more than a century and a half older than\r\nitself. The Gild of the Holy Cross, the earliest record of which is\r\nto be found in a writ of Richard II., July 10, 1392, was a body which\r\nconcerned itself, not of course with education, but with functions\r\npartly religious and partly quasi-municipal. It possessed a Gild\r\nHall, a building of wood and plaster, standing at a distance from the\r\ntown on the south side of the highway to Hales Owen, now New Street.\r\nIn 1547 its possessions were seized by the King, and they continued\r\nin the Crown until 1552, when Edward VI., upon the petition of the\r\ninhabitants, gave them back to the town for the maintenance of a Free\r\nGrammar School, for the instruction of children in grammar. The clear\r\nyearly value of these lands was then £21,[2] and they were assigned\r\nto William Symmons, gent., Richard Smallbrook, Bailiff, and 18 other\r\ninhabitants, “to hold by fealty only, in free soccage” on condition of\r\nan annual payment at Michaelmas of £1 (apparently commuted in 1810 for\r\n£25. 15s. 6d.). These twenty assignees were to hold their position for\r\nlife, and all vacancies by death or removal were to be filled up by\r\nco-optation. In the first instance they were to be inhabitants of the\r\nmanor of Birmingham, but the restriction was modified in 1830. They\r\nwere to nominate a Pedagogue and a Sub-pedagogue, to whose support the\r\nrevenues were to be exclusively employed; and they were permitted to\r\nacquire further revenues to an amount not exceeding £20 per annum.\r\n\r\nFIRST STATUTES.--More than one hundred years later, Oct. 20, 1676,\r\nthe Governors issued their first statutes. No tenant of school\r\nproperty might be a Governor. The house, then occupied by the chief\r\nschoolmaster, with a barn and croft in New Street,[3] a close called\r\nthe Lower Leasowe or Broom close, in the “foreign” of Birmingham, and\r\nthe pit on the lower side of the Leasowe, were appropriated to the use\r\nof himself and his successors for ever; while the usher’s house, with\r\nthe garden, use of the pump, and other appurtenances, a barn and croft\r\nin New Street, and Kimberley’s croft in Moor Street, were similarly\r\nappropriated to the usher. The salaries of the chief master and usher\r\nwere to be £68. 15s. 0d. and £34. 6s. 8d. respectively. There were\r\nappointed also a chief master’s assistant; an English master, to teach\r\nin a distinct school fifty boys[4] to read English; and a scrivener,\r\nto teach twenty boys to write and cast accounts. The first two were\r\nto be unmarried, but the Governor reserved the power of allowing the\r\nscrivener to marry. £30 per annum was allowed for repairs to the\r\nschool and masters’ houses, payment of dues, etc. Another statute\r\npermitted the Governors, when their funds allowed, “to set out to Poore\r\nTradesmen, when they come out of their apprenticeship, or others who\r\nwant stock to manage their trade, £10 a piece, _gratis_, for 6 months,\r\non good security;” but no record exists of this having been acted upon.\r\n\r\nSCHOLARSHIPS.--£70 a year was devoted to forming seven scholarships\r\nof £10 a year each, tenable at any college in either University.[5]\r\nChildren from the manor had the preference; then those from adjacent\r\nplaces, who had spent the last three years in the school; failing such,\r\nthe poorest and most capable, to be selected from the upper form by an\r\nindependent body.[6]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the reign of Charles II., the charter was surrendered to\r\nthe Crown, probably under a writ of “Quo warranto;” a new one dated\r\nFebruary 20, 1685, being granted by James II. Six years later, a decree\r\nin chancery was obtained annulling the new charter, and restoring the\r\nold one.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND BUILDING.--In 1707, the old Gild Hall was removed, and\r\na new building erected, consisting of a centre and two wings, the\r\nlatter coming close up to the street, enclosing three sides of a small\r\nquadrangle, comprising a dwelling house for the head master, one large\r\nand two small school rooms, and a library. A separate house for the\r\nsecond master stood behind. A large tower in the centre was “ornamented\r\nwith a sleepy figure of the donor, Edward VI., dressed in a royal\r\nmantle, with the ensigns of the garter, holding a Bible and a sceptre.”\r\nIn 1756, a set of urns was placed on the parapet, to relieve the stiff\r\nair of the building.[7]\r\n\r\nESTABLISHMENT OF BRANCH SCHOOLS.--In 1751, a step of far-reaching\r\nimportance to the town was taken. The Governors ordained that (having\r\nregard to “the great numbers of children who, by reason of their\r\npoverty or the negligence of their parents, were never taught to read\r\nthe English tongue, and the advantages from having many such children\r\ntaught to read English, more than could be taught in the School”) four\r\nmasters or mistresses[8] should be chosen to teach English to not more\r\nthan forty boys or girls apiece in various parts of the town, with a\r\nsalary of £15, or less in proportion to the numbers. In October, 1790,\r\nwe read that the Governors “have very laudably opened an evening school\r\nin their rooms in Shutt Lane” (used as a _branch_ school previous to\r\n1788), “for the instruction of forty boys in writing and accounts;\r\nanother school is also opened in Mr. Peele’s in Great Charles Street\r\nfor twenty boys.”[9]\r\n\r\nCORRUPTION IN THE MANAGEMENT.--Up to 1824, however, the school was far\r\nfrom doing its duty. The revenues disappeared in mysterious ways. The\r\nHead Master, Mr. Cooke, gave leases as he thought proper, both as to\r\nterms and duration. No money was granted for scholarships. The parents\r\npaid the most exorbitant terms for books and stationery. “Altogether\r\nthe school was a nest of peculation, and greediness became so paramount\r\nthat the statue of the Royal Founder was allowed to decay and to tumble\r\nfrom its time-honoured elevation into the quadrangle in front of the\r\nschool.” In 1824, an intrigue between the Governors, the Masters, and\r\nthe Bishop of Lichfield (whose consent was necessary to all changes),\r\nto move the school from the town, and make it select, was frustrated by\r\nthe vigorous action of the inhabitants, and a commission was appointed\r\nby the Court of Chancery to carry out a thorough investigation into\r\nthe conduct of the school. In 1825 the Master was ordered to draw up a\r\nscheme for its future establishment, and to report whether it should be\r\nrebuilt; and in 1828 it was further referred to him to enquire whether\r\nthe old site or a new one should be chosen, and how the money required\r\nshould be raised.\r\n\r\nTHE BILL OF 1830-1.--In May, 1830, after a prolonged struggle of\r\nthe Governors and Master against the people, a bill was presented\r\nto parliament to enable the Governors to build a new school, to\r\nraise £50,000 for the purpose, and to regulate the school according\r\nto a scheme approved by Chancery. It was vehemently opposed by the\r\nDissenters, on the clause directing that “no person shall be elected\r\na governor who is not a member of the Established Church of England,”\r\nand was thrown out on the third reading in the Lords, but passed in\r\nthe following year, the obnoxious clauses having been removed. In the\r\nfirst place, the school was to be rebuilt on the old site, at a cost\r\nof £30,000, and all branches of an English education, in addition to\r\nthe dead languages, were to be taught. No boy was to be admitted under\r\neight years of age, or retained after nineteen (no limits of age had\r\nexisted hitherto); and boys, not sons of inhabitants, were to pay\r\nfees. In the second place, a new school was to be built distinct from\r\nthe Grammar School, for the teaching of modern languages; while four\r\nbranch schools for the free education of boys and girls of the humbler\r\nclasses were to be erected before 1840, £1,000 being spent upon each.\r\nTen exhibitions, each of £50 per annum, were created, Birmingham boys\r\ntaking precedence. Ratepayers, though non-resident, might be governors,\r\nprovided they were not tenants of school property, and attended once in\r\ntwo years. The accounts were to be published yearly, and there was also\r\nto be an annual examination of the school.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT BUILDING.--The new building was erected from the designs of\r\nMr. Charles Barry, the architect of the Houses of Parliament. The style\r\nis the latest pure Gothic in England, that which prevailed immediately\r\nbefore the commencement of the 16th century. “The school is entered by\r\na spacious porch, highly ornamented: two large apartments, with oak\r\npannelled walls and ceilings, are the school room for the commercial\r\nschool;[10] the classical school is 120 feet long, 45 high, 30 wide,\r\nwith a lofty angular roof, supported by a series of magnificent obtuse\r\nangled arches of the Tudor style. At the end, where the chair of the\r\nHead Master is placed, is a handsome lofty oak carved screen. The\r\nSecond Master’s chair is opposite to this, and the Usher’s chairs are\r\non the sides. There is a library and a fine bust of Edward VI. by\r\nScheemaker.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1836 that the Governors were able to carry out\r\nactively the provisions of the Act of 1831. A fresh Act in 1837 amended\r\nthe former one by repealing the power to build a separate modern\r\nschool, which it was now arranged should be carried on in the premises\r\nof the Grammar School. The new building had cost £67,000, instead of\r\n£30,000; and the excess was to be defrayed out of the £50,000 mentioned\r\nin the Act of 1831. By the scheme approved in Chancery, in 1838,\r\nmasters were ordered to be appointed during that year in elementary\r\nliterature, geography, elements of composition, sacred and profane\r\nhistory, mathematics, natural philosophy, writing, and arithmetic;\r\nFrench and German masters in 1839 and 1840; and Spanish and Italian\r\nwhen advisable. Temporary lecturers might also be employed, and a\r\nvisitation of the school was to take place once a year. A branch\r\nschool was in progress in Aston Street, in 1837, and a second was\r\nproposed in Cottage Lane, near the Sandpits. Mr. E. Oxenbould and\r\nMiss A. Corbett were elected master and mistress of two others in the\r\nParade, in August, 1838; and a fourth for boys, was opened in Meriden\r\nStreet, on April 10, 1839. These branch schools, the history of which\r\nit is difficult to make out clearly, were for the time regulated by\r\nthe statute of 1852, which established four schools, Gem Street,\r\nEdward Street, Meriden Street, and Bath Row, accommodating altogether\r\n510 boys, from 8 to 14 years of age, and 490 girls from 7 to 13. The\r\nchildren were nominated by the Governors, and examined for admission\r\nby the Head Master, who had entire control of these schools, visited\r\nthem once a month, and made an annual report on their condition to the\r\nGovernors. A general English and religious education was given; the\r\nboys learning in addition bookkeeping and the elements of geometry, and\r\nthe girls, knitting and plain needlework.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 it was ordered that the second master should have the general\r\nsupervision of the English school, under the direction of the head\r\nmaster, who retained in his hands the admission and promotion of\r\nscholars, and most other matters of importance.\r\n\r\nDISCONTENT IN THE TOWN.--Meanwhile serious discontent had arisen\r\nwith the constitution of the body of governors. By the original\r\ncharter it was laid down that they should be “twenty of the more\r\ndiscreet inhabitants.” But, by the operation of the method of\r\nco-optation in filling up vacancies, the following state of things,\r\nas given by Mr. T. H. Green, one of the assistant commissioners\r\nof 1864, had arisen. “The Board has fairly represented the upper\r\nor more select section of society in Birmingham, so far as this\r\nsection is politically conservative and attached to the established\r\nChurch. It has been necessarily antagonistic to the Town Council,\r\nand careless or contemptuous of local politics. To belong to it has\r\nbeen a certain social distinction. Social and municipal distinction\r\nhave not coincided, and hence the Board has been an object of public\r\nanimosity, irrespectively of the manner in which it has exercised its\r\nfunctions.”[11] And this it still more strongly put in the report of\r\nthe Commission. “No dissenter, within the memory of man, has been a\r\ngovernor; till recently no one of liberal politics has been a governor;\r\nno mayor of the town has till the present year been a governor;\r\nno member of the borough except one, a conservative; not one Town\r\nCouncillor.”\r\n\r\nAbortive attempts were made in 1831, 1842, and 1861, to introduce the\r\nTown Council element; and in 1864, after much newspaper agitation,\r\nsignalised especially by the letters of “Historicus,”[12] a grammar\r\nschool Reform Association was formed, which, in 1865, in conjunction\r\nwith the Town Council, endeavoured in vain to induce the Governors\r\nto surrender the principle of co-optation. Both appealed to the\r\nEndowed Schools Commissioners, who proposed that there should be 21\r\ngovernors, of whom 10 should be chosen by the Town Council, and the\r\nrest by co-optation; and that for the future free education should be\r\ngiven only to those who had passed a competitive examination. In 1868,\r\nhowever, the Town Council resolved to demand that all the governors\r\nshould be elected from their body, a demand they repeated in 1872 (in\r\nanswer to a slight modification by the Commissioners of the above\r\nscheme). They also objected to the proposed entrance and tuition fees.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW SCHEME.--Finally, in 1875, the Charity Commissioners proposed\r\nthe scheme in a great measure now in force.[13] There were to be 21\r\ngovernors, of whom eight were to be nominated by the Town Council, and\r\nfour by Oxford, Cambridge, and London Universities, and the Teachers\r\non the foundation; the remainder by the governors themselves. Those\r\nnominated by the Town Council were to serve for six years, those by\r\nthe Universities and Teachers for seven: all were to be eligible for\r\nreappointment. Boys were to enter the school by competitive examination\r\nin two classes, (1) free foundation scholars; (2) those paying entrance\r\nand tuition fees.[14] This scheme was vehemently but unsuccessfully\r\ncontested by the Town Council. All efforts to move the Charity\r\nCommissioners were unavailing. When at length it reached the Commons,\r\non March 5th, 1878, Mr. Bright, supported by the other Borough members,\r\nMr. Chamberlain, and Mr. Muntz, moved its rejection; but the motion\r\nwas defeated by a majority of 59, in a house of 199, and the scheme\r\nreceived the royal assent on March 16th.\r\n\r\nImmediately previous to 1878, the schools on the foundation were (1)\r\nThe Grammar School (Classical, English, and Lower) with 584 boys:\r\n(2) the Branch Elementary Schools with 607 boys and 554 girls.[15] A\r\ngreat development was now arranged for. There were now to be (1) a\r\nHigh School for Boys up to the age of 19, with preparation for the\r\nUniversities; (2) a Middle School for Boys to age of 16, when Latin,\r\nat least one modern language, natural science, and drawing, were to\r\nbe taught. (3) An Upper School for Girls. (4) The existing branch\r\nElementary Schools, or “Lower Middle” School for children to age of 14,\r\nteaching all subjects included in the possible curriculum of the best\r\npublic Elementary Schools[16] though reaching a far higher standard\r\nthan is there obtained. The necessity for the head and second masters\r\nbeing in Orders was done away with; the religious teaching was to\r\nbe undoctrinal, and there was to be an emphatic conscience clause:\r\nno master might hold any benefice or cure of souls, nor might he in\r\nfuture,[17] without the express permission of the Governors, take\r\nboarders. The jurisdiction of the Master of the Middle School was\r\nincreased, though supreme authority in matters of discipline was still\r\nreserved to the Head Master. Provision was made for the subdivision of\r\nthe Middle School and the Upper Girls’ School, when desirable, and for\r\nthe establishment of evening schools.\r\n\r\nSCHOLARSHIPS were arranged as follows:--(1) Foundation Scholarships\r\nin all the Schools, the holders of which received education free. The\r\nnumber of these was not to exceed a third of the total number in each\r\nschool. Half of those given in the Lower Middle Schools were restricted\r\nto scholars attending Public Elementary Schools within the Borough, for\r\nnot less than two consecutive years immediately preceding admission,\r\nand a third of the remainder were offered for competition among the\r\ncandidates for admission; the rest being competed for by scholars\r\nalready in the School. (2) King Edward VI. Scholarships, viz.: annual\r\npayments to deserving scholars while at the school, to an amount not\r\nless than £200 a year; the value of each to be not more than £25 a\r\nyear _plus_ tuition fees. (3) Besides the James Charities exhibitions\r\nof £50 a year at Oxford or Cambridge, £400 a year was to be given for\r\nexhibitions at either of the Universities, to scholars of at least two\r\nyears standing in the High School; and £200 for exhibitions tenable at\r\nany educational institution for boys or girls at either High or Middle\r\nSchool. All these scholarships were to be gained by competition.[18]\r\n\r\nIn the competitive examination for entrance, preference was to be\r\ngiven to boys and girls resident within ten miles of Birmingham.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF 1883.--In 1883, the final step in development was taken.\r\nIt was felt that the “Lower Middle” Schools, were now doing work which\r\nlargely overlapped that of the Middle School, and the consent of the\r\nCharity Commissioners was obtained to the following change. These\r\nSchools were converted into Schools of the same grade as the “Middle”\r\nSchool of the 1878 scheme, (1) The Girls’ School at Meriden street\r\nhad been transferred to Camp hill, in 1881, and a Boys’ School was\r\nnow erected on the same site. (2) The Proprietary School at the Five\r\nWays was absorbed into the foundation, and the staff of the old Middle\r\nSchool, hitherto domiciled at New Street, was transferred to improved\r\nbuildings there, the boys from the Bath Row School also being taken\r\nin. The _pupils_ from the old Middle School were dispersed throughout\r\nthe various Boys’ Schools now opened. (3) This enabled the provision\r\nof 1878 for a High School for Girls to be carried out[19] in the New\r\nStreet Buildings thus left vacant. (4) A new school for Boys and Girls\r\nwas erected in Albert Road, Aston, to which the scholars from Gem\r\nStreet were transferred. In 1882, the Boys Schools at Edward Street,\r\nMeriden Street, and Bath Row were closed. Thus, at the present time,\r\nthe Schools under the foundation are--High Schools for Boys and Girls\r\nat New Street; Grammar Schools for Boys at the Five Ways, Boys and\r\nGirls at Aston and Camp Hill, Girls at Summer Hill and Bath Row. The\r\nadmission fee is at the High School, 10/-, and at the Grammar Schools,\r\n2/6; the annual tuition fee at the High Schools, £9; at the Grammar\r\nSchools, £3.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous honours gained at the Universities since 1800\r\nshould be mentioned the following:--at _Cambridge_, 8 chancellor’s\r\nmedallists, and 10 university scholars; 6 senior classics, 28 first\r\nclass-men in the classical tripos, and 6 first class-men in the moral\r\nscience tripos; 35 wranglers: at _Oxford_, 8 university scholars, 5\r\nfirst class-men _in Literis Humanioribus_, 11 in classical moderations,\r\nand 2 _in Disciplinis Mathematicis et Physicis_. The present Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, one Bishop (Lightfoot), and one Regius Professor of\r\nDivinity (Westcott), are also old Birmingham boys. During the past few\r\nyears the school has also gained high and numerous distinctions at\r\nLondon University, Queen’s College (Birmingham), and the Mason Science\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nLIST OF THE HEAD MASTERS from the earliest date now known:--_circa_\r\n1650, John Barton; 1654, Nathaniel Brooksby; 1685, John Hickes, M.A.;\r\n1694, James Parkinson; 1722, John Hansted; 1726, Edward Mainwaring;\r\n1746, John Wilkinson; 1759, Thomas Green; 1766, John Brailsford;\r\n1775, Thomas Price; 1797, John Cooke; 1830, Francis Jeune (afterwards\r\nDean of Jersey, Master of Pembroke College, Oxford, and Bishop\r\nof Peterborough); 1838, James Prince Lee (afterwards Bishop of\r\nManchester); 1848, Edwin Hamilton Gifford, Archdeacon of London; 1862,\r\nCharles Evans; 1872, A. R. Vardy. It should also be mentioned that\r\nin 1830, the second master was the Rev. Rann Kennedy, father of the\r\ncelebrated Head Master of Shrewsbury, himself a classic of the highest\r\nattainments.\r\n\r\n=Queen’s College.=--The story of Queen’s College is an interesting\r\nrecord of mingled success and failure; of success where it set about\r\ndoing much needed work, and of failure where it appeared to be placing\r\nitself in antagonism to the prevailing spirit and influences of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nThe formation of a School of Medicine and Surgery for Birmingham and\r\nthe Midland Counties was suggested in 1828 by Mr. Sands Cox, who had\r\nmade a diligent inspection of all the chief medical schools at home and\r\nabroad; and it was immediately carried out by the help of Dr. Johnstone\r\nand the unstinted liberality of Dr. Warneford. Lectureships in various\r\nbranches of Medicine were at once established, and in 1830 a Museum\r\nand Library were fitted up. From 1836 to 1843 the new Institution was\r\nknown as “The Birmingham Royal School of Medicine and Surgery,” the\r\nroyal patronage having been obtained in the former year. But in 1843\r\na Royal Charter of Incorporation was granted to it under the title of\r\n“The Queen’s College, at Birmingham.” By the munificent endowments of\r\nDr. Warneford,[20] the Governors were soon enabled to widen the scope\r\nof the college. Departments were created for literature, science, and\r\nart, and for instruction in the doctrines and duties of Christianity\r\naccording to the Church of England. Queen’s Hospital was founded with\r\na chaplaincy, also endowed with £1,000 by Dr. Warneford, who, in\r\naddition, appears to have borne almost the whole expense of the College\r\nChapel. An arrangement was now made whereby the London University\r\nadmitted students of the college for the degrees of Bachelor and\r\nDoctor of Medicine, and, upon the college Certificate, for B.A., M.A.,\r\nB.C.L., and D.C.L. The exclusively Church of England character of the\r\ncollege and all concerned with it was untiringly insisted upon by its\r\npromoters. A chapel was established with daily services at which the\r\nattendance was compulsory. By the supplemental charter of 1847 it was\r\nlaid down that the Lord Bishop of the Diocese was to be the visitor;\r\nthe Principal, who was to be a Nobleman, or one of the Hon. Governors,\r\nmust also belong to the Church of England. The Vice-President must\r\nbe a dignitary of the Church near Birmingham: all the classical,\r\nmathematical, and medical tutors must also be churchmen. The feelings\r\nwhich prompted these rigorous regulations are concisely expressed\r\nin a letter of Dr. Warneford to Mr. Sands Cox in 1849, in which he\r\nsays, “to guard against the subtle designs of the Jesuits, and the\r\ninsidious intrusion of malignant dissenters, imperatively requires much\r\ndeliberation!” From a second supplemental charter of 1851, it appears\r\nthat Dr. Warneford had given £4,400, increased in 1852 by £6,500, for\r\na Professorship of Pastoral Theology; and £3,500, increased in 1852 by\r\n£2,500, for a Wardenship, the holder of which must necessarily be a\r\nclergyman. All resident students were to be members of the Church, and\r\nattendance at Chapel service was compulsory.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the attempt to erect an exclusively\r\nChurch of England College in a town in which dissent was overwhelmingly\r\npredominant was a leading cause of the failure which awaited the\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the college were by the original charter to be conducted\r\nby a council of eighteen, of whom twelve were to be elected by the\r\nfirst body of Governors, and two were to be Professors elected from\r\ntheir own body; the Principal, Vice-Principal, Treasurer, and Dean of\r\nthe Faculty completed the number. Vacancies in the council were to be\r\nfilled up by co-optation, and vacancies in the Professorial staff by\r\nthe council from a list supplied by the Professors. By the supplemental\r\ncharter of 1847, the Principal and Council were constituted one\r\nbody politic and corporate, and were allowed to acquire property of\r\nan annual value not exceeding £2,500, and the same amount for the\r\nhospital. The council was also greatly widened by twelve _ex-officio_\r\nGovernors, of whom two were members of the council of the hospital,\r\nwhich was represented also by the senior Physician and senior Surgeon;\r\nthe others were the Lord-Lieutenant and High Sheriff of Warwickshire,\r\nthe Dean of Worcester, Archdeacon of Coventry, the Mayor of the\r\nborough, the High Bailiff of the Manor, and the Rectors of St. Martin’s\r\nand St. Philip’s.\r\n\r\nTo this body of _ex-officio_ governors was entrusted the appointment\r\nof the Warden, who later became the real ruler of the college, all\r\nmatters of general organisation and discipline, and all religious\r\nduties, being in his hands. The council was further widened by the\r\nadmission of two members of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers,\r\nand two each from the Birmingham Architectural and Law Societies. An\r\neast wing was added to the college, for engineering and architecture,\r\ncontaining lecture rooms and an engineering workshop. A three years’\r\ncourse and the passing of two public examinations constituted the\r\nrequirements for the degree of C.E. of Queen’s College. A Department of\r\nGeneral Literature was formed, Dr. Warneford endowing it in 1852 with\r\n£2,000. A full collegiate system was established for this department,\r\nwith resident, and later non-resident students, at which a three years’\r\ncourse was to be passed. The subjects of study were to be Greek, Latin,\r\nMathematics, Logic, Modern Languages, History, Civil Engineering,\r\nNatural, Political, and Moral Philosophy, and the doctrines of the\r\nChurch of England; the subjects selected having particular reference\r\nto the requirements for the examination of the University of London.\r\nA Junior Department was also established in or about 1851, for a\r\ntwo years’ preparatory course with collegiate discipline. The whole\r\nconstitution of the college was, however, codified by the “Rules\r\nand Regulations” of 1857; by which it appears that these somewhat\r\nambitious views, pointing to the establishment of a University, had\r\nbecome modified. The design of the college, as now laid down, was “to\r\nprovide instruction for young men intending to engage in one or other\r\nof the following professions:--(1) Medicine and Surgery; (2) Civil\r\nArchitecture and Engineering; (3) Theology (with a view to ordination);\r\nand any other professional study which may from time to time be\r\nadded.[21] This instruction is combined with a system of collegiate\r\ntraining and moral discipline according to the religious principles of\r\nthe English schools and colleges connected with the Church of England,\r\nand with so much of the ordinary branches of a liberal education, in\r\na department of arts and general literature, as may be properly given\r\nin subordination and in reference to such special studies.” For the\r\ncollegiate education the inclusive fees were to be £75 a year.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that this idea of creating a resident\r\nUniversity in Birmingham was the result of mistaken, though religious,\r\nzeal. For the deep and earnest feelings which prompted it we must\r\nrefer to the record of the meeting of April 20, 1843, contained in Mr.\r\nSands-Cox’s _Annals of Queen’s College_, published in 1873. But the\r\nconditions of life in the town were not favourable, and the scheme\r\nbroke down through its own weight. Resident students there were,\r\nindeed, in small numbers; but the pecuniary loss which they caused to\r\nthe college was considerable, and in 1873 that part of the scheme from\r\nwhich, thirty years before, so much had been hoped, was declared not\r\nto be “an essential part of the College,” and was allowed to lapse.\r\nLord Lyttelton, the President, in a letter written in December, 1873,\r\nstrongly, though reluctantly, urged this step. As strongly, too, he\r\nurged that the theological department should be discontinued. “The more\r\nsimply and singly the college can henceforth be limited to the objects\r\nof a place of instruction for medical students, the better and more\r\nlikely it is to attain those objects. The hopes that the college might\r\nbecome a University, with the consequent attempt to engraft upon it\r\nFaculties of Arts, Law, and others, are now, as I fear, mere dreams of\r\nthe past.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the work of the college appears for some years to have been\r\nconducted with considerable vigour, and a certain success. Gradually,\r\nhowever, whether from bad management, or from the inherent faults of\r\nthe constitution, it began to decay, and then its decline was rapid.\r\nIn 1863, an appeal was put out to relieve it from a debt of nearly\r\n£4,000; and in 1864, its condition fell under the eyes of the Charity\r\nCommissioners. As the result of their enquiry “it appeared in effect\r\nthat the college had fallen into a state of decay, and was on the verge\r\nof bankruptcy; that the buildings were suffering from want of funds\r\nfor repairs, and the students diminishing, and that the college could\r\nnot be made effective and answer the purpose for which it was founded,\r\nwithout the interference of the Court of Chancery, and that the\r\npresent constitution of the said college was defective.” Accordingly,\r\nin February, 1867, a scheme was ordered to be drawn up for the future\r\nmanagement, approved by the Master of the Rolls, May 7, 1867, and\r\nconfirmed by “The Queen’s College, Birmingham, Act.” The council was\r\nhenceforth to consist of the President, Vice-President, Warden, and\r\ntwelve others. No condition of churchmanship was attached to the last\r\nnamed. All vacancies were to be filled up, no longer by co-optation,\r\nbut by the annual meetings. Officers of the college might serve on the\r\nCouncil, but no one who was concerned in the profits of any work done\r\nor materials provided for the college. The three original departments,\r\ntheology, medicine, and arts,[22] were maintained, the Warden to be\r\nthe resident head of all three. Architecture and engineering were\r\ndropped out. Until the debt was cleared off, the offices of Warden and\r\nProfessor of Theology were to be held by the same person, afterwards\r\nby different persons, the Professor to be appointed by the President,\r\nVice-President, and Visitor. There were to be also Professors of\r\nClassics and Mathematics and a Medical Tutor. The rights of the church\r\nwere further secured by a clause referring all questions touching her\r\ndoctrine and discipline to the President and Vice-President, and in\r\nthe last resort to the Visitor, whose decision was to be final. With\r\nthe obvious exceptions, however, of the Warden and Theology Professor,\r\nall religious tests on the members of the staff were abolished.\r\nMethods were laid down for the payment of the existing debt. A clause,\r\nspecially declaring that the natural history and anatomy museum were\r\nto be preserved in the college, along with the models of machinery and\r\nphilosophical apparatus, and were to be open to properly qualified\r\npersons free of charge, was violated in 1870 by their being removed to\r\nAston Hall, the rooms thus set free being given up to the School of\r\nArt. Finally, the college and hospital were entirely separated, the\r\nlatter being compelled to repay Warneford’s endowment of £1,000.\r\n\r\nDuring 1873 and 1874, evening classes in connection with the Arts\r\nDepartment were started “to afford to young men who have had a good\r\neducation, and who desire to maintain and improve their acquirements,\r\nan opportunity of doing this at a small expense.” Morning Classes for\r\nladies in connection with the Birmingham Higher Education Association\r\nwere also attempted. The Arts Department of the College itself appears\r\nto have died a natural death in 1872: in 1871 it contained “three or\r\nfour students preparing for admission into the Theological or Medical\r\nDepartments.”\r\n\r\nThe Theological Department also has led a languishing existence. In\r\n1874 it contained but 11 students[23] and from then until 1882 the\r\nnumber fluctuated between 11 and 23. Since then it has again been\r\ndeclining. The report of 1885 laments this fact, but gives no figures.\r\nAn attempt has been made in this year to raise the standard of this\r\ndepartment by appointing the Cambridge Preliminary Examination as the\r\nfinal examination of the College.\r\n\r\nIt is by the Medical School, its original _raison d’être_, that\r\nQueen’s College has a distinct claim upon Birmingham and the Midlands.\r\nThis part of the scheme has always flourished and still is flourishing;\r\nand it is justly regarded as one of the most important provincial\r\nschools of medicine in the kingdom. It started with almost its full\r\ndevelopment from the beginning. Thus in 1828 the plan of lectures\r\nincluded anatomy, physiology, and pathology, materia medica and medical\r\nbotany, chemistry, and pharmacy, principles and practice of physic\r\nand surgery, midwifery and other diseases of women and children. In\r\n1845, we find this list increased by the division of anatomy into\r\n“General and Surgical,” and “Descriptive and Comparative.” Chemistry\r\nalso was added. In 1874, the Chair of Pathology, which had dropped out\r\nof the original list, was recreated, and an additional Professorship\r\nof Physiology and Anatomy appointed. In 1880, following the Act for\r\nthe Registration of Dentists, a School of Dental Medicine and Surgery\r\nwas formed, and this was recognised in 1882 by the Royal College of\r\nSurgeons. The lectures on anatomy and chemistry were recognised as\r\nqualifying for the degrees of the University of Edinburgh. In 1885, the\r\nBorough Lunatic Asylum was associated with the College, students being\r\nnow at liberty to obtain instruction in lunacy and mental diseases.\r\nSummer dissections were also carried on for the first time in this year.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, consequent upon the organisation of the Mason Science College,\r\nan important change was made. It was felt that if both institutions\r\ncarried on, within a stone’s throw of each other, parallel courses of\r\nlectures, great waste of power would ensue. It was therefore arranged\r\nthat the lectures on chemistry, botany, and physiology should in\r\nfuture be delivered by the Professors of Mason College, acting as\r\nlecturers for Queen’s College, and delivering courses of lectures\r\nsuited to the requirements of medical students. In this way not only\r\nwas the overlapping avoided, but the endowments of Queen’s College\r\nwere materially relieved, while the resources of the Mason College\r\nmagnificent library were also available to the students of the former.\r\nThe Birmingham Medical School was now placed in a position of equality\r\nwith the richest and best organised Colleges in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that in 1879, in addition to the already\r\nexisting Ingleby Scholarships, two new classes of entrance scholarships\r\nwere created by the Council, the Sydenham and Queen’s. The former\r\nwere to be given by the vote of the Council to the orphan sons of\r\nlegally qualified medical men; the Queen’s were to be awarded by\r\nexamination to sons of medical men; the sons of former students having\r\nthe preference in both cases. At the present time the college contains\r\nconsiderably more than 100 students, that being the normal number. That\r\nits condition, so far as medicine is concerned, is one of vigorous\r\nvitality, may be gathered from the following extract from the last\r\nReport. “The students have passed examinations at five Universities, in\r\nsix cases gaining distinction, one being the highest attainable. At the\r\nPrimary Examination for the Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons\r\nof England, thirty students passed in one or both branches. At the\r\nabove mentioned examinations there were only four complete rejections\r\nduring the year. It must be borne in mind, also, that this result does\r\nnot accrue from careful weeding out of students by a test examination.\r\nAll students, having attended the required number of lectures, were\r\npermitted to present themselves for examination.”\r\n\r\n=Mason College.=--The scheme of a University at Queen’s College had,\r\nas we have seen, broken down through the inherent defects of its\r\ndesign. We come now to the establishment of another University, which\r\nin its building, equipment, and aims, forms a worthy completion to the\r\neducational system of the town.\r\n\r\nIndirectly the result, no doubt, of that movement for University\r\nextension which has characterized the last twenty years, the\r\nestablishment of this college was directly the work of one man, Sir\r\nJosiah Mason, whose fortune had been made during sixty years’ residence\r\nin Birmingham, and who was already a benefactor to the town through\r\nthe Orphanage and Almshouses he had established at Erdington. The\r\nconsiderations which prompted him to this noble foundation are thus\r\nexpressed by himself:--“When I was a young man--it is so long ago that\r\nwhile still living in this generation I can recall the memories of a\r\ntime long past--there were no means of scientific teaching open to\r\nthe artisan classes of our manufacturing towns; and those who, like\r\nmyself, would gladly have benefited by them were compelled to plod\r\ntheir weary way, under disadvantages and through difficulties of which\r\nour young men of this day can form no adequate idea. Schools at that\r\ntime were few and poor, there were no institutions of popular teaching,\r\nno evening classes to which youths might go after their day’s work was\r\nended.” At eighty years of age, therefore, he determined to provide\r\n“enlarged means of scientific instruction, on the scale required by the\r\nnecessities of this town and district, and upon terms which render it\r\neasily available by persons of all classes, even the very humblest.”\r\nWhatever was necessary for the improvement of scientific industry, and\r\nfor the cultivation of art, especially as applied to manufactures, was\r\nto be taught; facilities were to be afforded, if desirable, for medical\r\ninstruction, and, most wisely, the door was left open for any further\r\ndevelopment necessary to adapt the scheme to the requirements of future\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the college first began to assume shape about 1868, under\r\nthe advice of Mr. G. J. Johnson, formerly Professor of Law in Queen’s\r\nCollege; Mr. George Shaw, formerly Professor of Chemistry at Queen’s\r\nCollege; and Mr. J. Thackray Bunce. It was not, however, until December\r\n12, 1870, that the Foundation Deed was executed, by which Dr. Blake\r\nand Mr. Johnson were constituted the first trustees. The Founder had\r\nalready purchased some land in Edmund Street, and an endeavour was made\r\nto secure the ground at the corner of Edmund Street and Congreve Street\r\n(upon which the new Liberal Club now stands); failing that the land\r\nstretching through Edmund Street to Great Charles Street was, after\r\nmany difficulties and delays, obtained. The site contains about an acre.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1872, the six trustees required by the foundation deed\r\nwere thus nominated: Dr. Blake, Messrs. G. J. Johnson, W. C. Aitken,\r\nJ. T. Bunce, George Shaw, and Dr. Heslop; and their first meeting was\r\nheld on Feb. 23rd, 1873. The architect selected by the founder, Mr. J.\r\nA. Cossins, had meanwhile been visiting the principal science colleges\r\nat home and abroad; and his plans, prepared from this experience,\r\nwere approved in the autumn of 1874. On the founder’s 80th birthday,\r\nFebruary 25th, 1875, the first stone was laid by himself, when, in\r\nreplying to a congratulatory address, he gave an interesting sketch of\r\nhis career from the day when he cobbled shoes in Kidderminster, to the\r\ntime when he became the owner of the largest pen factory in the world.\r\nA full description of the college buildings as completed may be found\r\nin the _Birmingham Daily Post_ for October 2nd, 1880.[24] Since that\r\ntime an important addition has been made by the erection of a series of\r\nrooms for the Physiological department.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation Deed lays down this general statement as to the aims of\r\nthe proposed college:--\r\n\r\n“It being understood that the institution intended to be hereby founded\r\nis to be called Josiah Mason’s Scientific College, or Josiah Mason’s\r\nCollege for the study of Practical Science, he, the said Josiah Mason,\r\nhereby declares that his intention in founding the same is to promote\r\nthorough systematic education and instruction specially adapted to the\r\npractical, mechanical, and artistic requirements of the manufactures\r\nand industrial pursuits of the midland district, and particularly the\r\nboroughs of Birmingham and Kidderminster, _to the exclusion of mere\r\nliterary education and instruction, and of all teaching of theology\r\nand of subjects purely theological_, which limitations the said Josiah\r\nMason hereby declares to be fundamental.”\r\n\r\nThe deed then provides for two courses of instruction, namely:--\r\n\r\n1.--_Regular systematic instruction_ (to qualify students either for\r\nthe B.Sc. and D.Sc. of the University of London, or for any profession\r\nor pursuit in which scientific knowledge can be usefully applied.)\r\n\r\n2.--_Popular instruction_, which it is intended shall be given by\r\nevening lectures to artisans and others who cannot attend the classes\r\nfor regular systematic instruction.\r\n\r\nThe regular instruction was to include the following:--_Mathematics_,\r\nabstract and applied; _Physics_, mathematical and experimental;\r\n_Chemistry_, theoretical, practical, and applied; _The Natural\r\nSciences_, especially geology and mineralogy, with their application\r\nto mines and metallurgy; _Botany_ and _Zoology_; _Physiology_, with\r\nreference to the Laws of Health; _English_, _French_, and _German\r\nLanguages_. By a subsequent deed of February 23, 1874, Anatomy, and\r\nGreek and Latin languages, were added to the list. And by a third\r\ndeed, February 23, 1881, it is provided that (in order to qualify the\r\nCollege for admission as a constituent member of the London or Victoria\r\nUniversities) regular systematic instruction may at the discretion of\r\nthe Trustees include _all such other subjects_ as the Trustees may for\r\nthe time being judge necessary or desirable for the benefit of the\r\nstudents. Similar liberty to vary the course of instruction, either\r\nby the addition of fresh subjects, or discontinuance of any subject\r\npreviously taught, according to the discretion of the Trustees, is\r\ngiven in the case of the Popular Instruction.\r\n\r\nMoreover, once in every fifteen years the provisions of the deed may\r\nbe varied, so as better to adapt the regulations to the circumstances\r\nof the time. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of this\r\nprovision, which formed the subject of the peroration of a beautiful\r\nspeech by Prof. Max Müller at the opening ceremony, which ended\r\nthus:--“Let him rest assured that such faith is never belied, and that\r\nrising and coming generations, while applauding his munificence, will\r\nhonour and cherish his memory for nothing so much as for that one\r\nclause in which he seems to say, like a wise father, ‘Children, I trust\r\nyou.’” (College Calendar, 1880-81.)\r\n\r\nOne class of subjects alone is emphatically excluded. It is “provided\r\nalways, that no lectures, or teaching, or examination, shall be\r\npermitted in the institution upon theology, or any question or subject\r\nin its nature purely theological, or upon any question which for the\r\ntime being shall be the subject of party political controversy.” And\r\nthis condition “the said Josiah Mason doth declare to be fundamental.”\r\nSimilarly it is declared to be a fundamental condition that “no\r\nprincipal, vice-principal, professor, teacher, or other officer,\r\nservant, or assistant of the institution shall be required to make any\r\ndeclaration as to, or to submit to any test whatever of their religious\r\nor theological opinions, or be presumed to be qualified or disqualified\r\nby any such religious or theological opinions, but shall be appointed\r\nsolely for their fitness to give the scientific or artistic instruction\r\nrequired from them.” The contrast with Queen’s College was complete.\r\n\r\nFees were to be paid by students, the admission of whom is subject to\r\nno limitation whatever in the popular classes.[25] The only limitation\r\nas regards the regular classes is that the Trustees are to give the\r\npreference, all other things being equal, to candidates who have\r\nbeen or are inmates of the Orphanage, to the extent of not more than\r\none-fifth of the whole number of regular students, and thereafter to\r\ncandidates born within the borough of Birmingham and Kidderminster,\r\nin the proportion of two Birmingham to one Kidderminster student. The\r\noriginal deed provided that no student not wholly dependent for a\r\nlivelihood upon his own skill or labour, or depending upon the support\r\nof his parents or some other person, should be admitted to the college;\r\nand that students should not be under fourteen nor above twenty-five\r\nyears of age. By the deed of variation, December 12, 1870, the limit of\r\nage was done away with, and the conditions above laid down were made to\r\napply to the remission of fees. A preliminary examination for admission\r\nis imposed only upon students under the age of sixteen years.\r\n\r\nIn every line the deed breathes the spirit of modern Birmingham; it\r\ncontains regulations directed to a clear aim, with absolute freedom\r\nto vary those regulations so as best, at any given time, to secure\r\nthat aim by recognising new conditions; it excludes from its scheme\r\nno subject of useful learning; and it maintains the idea that secular\r\ninstruction is of too high a dignity to be fettered, as regards either\r\npupils or instructors, by theological or political considerations. In\r\none provision not yet noticed it recognises with equal directness, the\r\nprinciple by which Birmingham has for long been pervaded, viz., that\r\nover all the great institutions of the town, popular control ought\r\nto be exercised. Until the death of the founder, the governing body\r\nwas to consist of six trustees; but it was ordered that after his\r\ndeath the Town Council was to nominate five others. Vacancies in the\r\nBorough Trustees were to be filled up by the Town Council; those in the\r\nother six by the whole body. One single qualification is laid down as\r\nfundamental for the trusteeship. The holder must be a Protestant and a\r\nlayman.\r\n\r\nOn October 1st, 1880, the College was formally opened, when a brilliant\r\naddress was delivered in the Town Hall, by Professor Huxley, before\r\na meeting attended by representatives of the Universities, and many\r\nleading scientific bodies, and presided over by the Mayor; and, in\r\nthe evening of the same day took place the formal transfer of the\r\nbuilding by the Founder to the Trustees. “Thus was completed a work\r\nwhich stands without parallel in the annals of modern education in\r\nEngland, the gift of a college, amply planned, nobly built, liberally\r\nendowed; the generous benefaction of one man, who looked for no reward\r\nbut the consciousness that, by the foundation, others would have the\r\nmeans of acquiring knowledge denied by the poverty of his early life to\r\nhimself; trusting that though unblessed with children of his own, he\r\nmight, in the students of his college, leave behind him an intelligent,\r\nearnest, industrious, and truth loving and truth seeking progeny for\r\nmany generations to come.” During the first year of work, 53 students\r\nattended: in 1884-85, 523, of whom 199 were in the evening classes.\r\n\r\nDuring the session, 1882-3, the college began receiving a grant from\r\nthe science and art department, in aid of the instruction of a limited\r\nnumber of teachers engaged in science teaching. During the same year,\r\nby arrangement with the School Board, the Council granted six Wright\r\nMemorial Scholarships, to enable scholars from Board Schools to go\r\nthrough a science course at Mason College.[26] These scholarships are\r\ntenable for three years, and relieve the scholars of the payment of all\r\nfees.\r\n\r\nThe Mason College Union, formed with the sanction of the council, was\r\nnow opened.[27] The circumstances attending the admission of students\r\nfrom Queen’s College to certain classes will be found detailed in the\r\nsection treating of that institution. The completion of the scheme\r\nnecessitated the creation of a new Chair of Botany. In the early part\r\nof the session, the council constituted the Professors of the College\r\nan Academic Board, to act generally under the superintendence of the\r\ncouncil in regulating and co-ordinating the various departments of the\r\ncollege; the chairmanship being held by the Professors in turn. In\r\nJuly, 1883, a department of Coal Mining and Colliery Management was\r\nestablished, and upwards of twenty students attended, principally young\r\nmining engineers, preparing for the government examination. During the\r\nyear courses of lectures upon education, provided by Mr. George Dixon,\r\nwere delivered by Professor Meiklejohn and Mr. H. Courthope Bowen.\r\nDuring 1884, the council were enabled to fill up a gap which they had\r\noften deplored by the creation of nine scholarships, as follows: Two\r\nentrance scholarships of £30 each; one of £30 for students of one\r\nyear’s standing; two of £30 each for students of two years’ standing;\r\ntwo of £20 each, connected with the examinations of the University of\r\nLondon; and two technical scholarships of £30 each. Each of these is\r\ntenable for one year. In the following year, Messrs. Richard and George\r\nTangye each created a scholarship of the annual value of £30. Free\r\npopular lectures for artisans were given throughout the winter, the\r\ntickets being distributed among about one hundred of the leading firms.\r\nSo much were they valued, that it was found necessary to repeat each\r\nlecture.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important and interesting features of the college is\r\nits noble library. With this will always be connected the name of the\r\nlate Dr. Heslop, its chief benefactor, indeed, it may be said, its\r\nmaker. As early as 1882, out of its 4,869 volumes, he had contributed\r\n3,130. On the 23rd February, 1886, the library contained 17,554 vols.\r\nThe geological museum contained at the same date 19,115 specimens.\r\n\r\n=The Birmingham and Midland Institute= is at present educating more\r\nthan 4000 persons of both sexes and of all ranks; and this fact alone\r\nis sufficient to show its importance. The principle upon which it\r\nproceeds is one which at the time of its establishment was entirely\r\nnovel, though it has since been adopted in other similar institutions.\r\nIt has never professed to lay down _a priori_ a course of instruction\r\nwhich it considers ought to be given; but, by supplying a want wherever\r\nsuch want has been made known, it has endeavoured to adapt itself\r\nconstantly to requirements of the people which otherwise would never be\r\nsatisfied. In the words of Mr. J. H. Chamberlain, “We have never made\r\nup our minds to teach any particular subject, unless we were convinced\r\nthat there existed outside our walls a present readiness to study it.\r\nBut, once convinced of such a desire, we have done whatever we could to\r\nmeet it.”\r\n\r\nThe Institute had its origin, strangely enough, at a time of marked\r\nintellectual decadence in Birmingham. The existing societies, the\r\nPhilosophical Institution, the Mechanics’ Institution, and the\r\nPolytechnic Institution, were dead or moribund. On June 10th, 1852, at\r\nthe suggestion of Mr. Arthur Ryland, a few members of the first-named\r\nsociety met and appointed a committee which reported in January, 1853.\r\nOn September 6th the Town Council gave a grant of the present site,\r\nand by an Act obtained in 1854 the Institute was incorporated. In this\r\nAct the objects of the Institute are defined to be the “diffusion\r\nand advancement of Science, Literature, and Art.” There were to be\r\ntwo departments, (a) _General_, to provide (1) Reading and News\r\nRooms; (2) Libraries, Museums, a gallery of the fine arts, collection\r\nof mining records, and other collections for scientific purposes;\r\n(3) Lectures and meetings for discussion in the higher branches of\r\nknowledge, (b) _Industrial_, to provide (1) classes for elementary and\r\nprogressive instruction in Mathematics and Practical Science, and such\r\nother subjects as may seem fit to the Council of the Institute; (2)\r\nlaboratories, models, philosophical apparatus, and all other things\r\nnecessary for the objects of the Institute.[28] The Institute was to\r\nbe governed by a Council of twenty-five consisting of (1) _Official\r\nGovernors_, a President, two Vice-presidents, and a Treasurer; the head\r\nmaster of King Edward’s Grammar School, the warden of Queen’s College,\r\nthe chairmen of the Committee of the Birmingham Society of Arts, and\r\nof the government School of ornamental Art. (2) _Borough Governors_,\r\nthe Mayor and four members of the Town Council, elected annually by\r\nthat body; and (3) thirteen _Elected Governors_, viz: eleven members\r\nof the Institute, and two students of the Industrial Department. The\r\nPresident, the Vice-Presidents, and the thirteen, were to be chosen\r\nby the members of the Institute at the annual general meeting. Casual\r\nvacancies were to be filled up by the Council, which was to meet at\r\nleast once a month. Not less than three of the thirteen were to be\r\nregarded as ineligible for re-election each year. Among the Presidents\r\nwill be found the men most eminent in their various branches of\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nA start was made in the beginning of 1854, the salary of a Science\r\nteacher for the first year having been guaranteed by the Science\r\nand Art department. Classes were opened in Chemistry, Physics, and\r\nPhysiology, for both sexes, and were carried on in the room of the\r\nPhilosophical Institute in Cannon Street, until 1857. On November 22nd,\r\n1855, £10,000 having previously been subscribed to the building fund,\r\nthe first stone of the new buildings was laid by the Prince Consort.\r\nPenny Scientific lectures were now started; and, in deference to a most\r\nremarkable expression of opinion on the part of the artisans themselves\r\nthat they had not education sufficient to enable them to profit by\r\nthe lectures as given, Penny Lectures on elementary Mathematics and\r\nScience were also given. In 1856 Mr. George Dawson and Mr. Sam:\r\nTimmins volunteered to conduct an English Literature class, which they\r\ncontinued for three years, and classes, also taught voluntarily, were\r\nestablished in Arithmetic, Latin, French, English History, Logic,\r\nLanguages, and Thought.[29]\r\n\r\nIn 1859, a subscription of £5,000 having been raised to pay off\r\nthe debt incurred, the Institute now located in its own buildings,\r\nfounded a Chemical Society--at present the Institute Scientific\r\nSociety--members of which delivered lectures to the men in workshops,\r\nas well as Natural History and Microscopical Societies. In the\r\nexamination by the Society of Arts in 1859, one Institute student,\r\nC. J. Woodward, now at the head of the Chemical department of the\r\nInstitute, took the first prize in chemistry, twelve others gaining\r\ncertificates; while in 1860 both the English literature prizes were\r\ncarried off by two other students, Henry Simpson and Howard S. Pearson,\r\nnow Lecturer on English Literature at the Institute. That the right\r\nclasses were being touched is shown by the fact that 33 per cent. of\r\nthe students were artisans, 33 per cent. shopmen and clerks, and 16\r\nper cent. women of the same ranks. In 1868 the numbers were 45, 29,\r\nand 21 per cent. A steady increase both of students and subscribers\r\n(the latter induced by the annual conversazione and the high quality\r\nof the occasional lectures) took place during the following years; and\r\nthe students were stimulated by the many valuable prizes offered by\r\nleading inhabitants and by the Central Literary Association. So crowded\r\nhad the classes now become, that it was imperative to secure further\r\nspace; and in 1873 the prospect of this was secured by a re-arrangement\r\nof buildings and an exchange of land with the Free Libraries, £15,000\r\nbeing subscribed for the alterations proposed. In the previous year\r\nCharles Kingsley had delivered a famous presidential address, one\r\nresult of which was an anonymous gift of £2,500 to found a class in\r\nthe Laws of Health. This class was opened in October, 1873, with 400\r\nstudents, and ever since that time has formed an important feature\r\nin the Institute’s programme, branch classes in the subject being\r\nestablished in 1878 in four of the Board Schools.\r\n\r\nAt the same date a new departure was made by founding branch classes\r\nat three Board Schools in the outskirts of the borough. Of the success\r\nof the Industrial Department up to this time we cannot do better than\r\nquote from an article by Mr. Edwin Smith, for many years secretary to\r\nthe Institute, in the _Central Literary Magazine_ for April, 1874:--\r\n\r\n    “It has enabled a pupil teacher from a national school to win a\r\n    Whitworth scholarship against competitors from the universities\r\n    and from the principal science colleges in the kingdom; a\r\n    working rule maker to win a scholarship at one of the Royal\r\n    Colleges of Science, and a working electro-plater to win the\r\n    first prizes from the Society of Arts in four modern languages;\r\n    it has sent out distinguished pupils to take part in the civil\r\n    service of India, to conduct mining operations in America, to\r\n    take part in the telegraphic service of Australia, to fill an\r\n    important commercial post in Japan, to conduct the laboratory\r\n    work in some of the largest manufactories in the country,\r\n    to become head masters and assistant masters in our Grammar\r\n    Schools, to help in the science teaching of the University of\r\n    Cambridge, and to fill responsible posts on newspapers of the\r\n    provincial press; twelve of its own teachers have been educated\r\n    in its classes, and it has sent into the manufactories and\r\n    workshops of the town, men who have applied to numerous useful\r\n    purposes in their trade the knowledge which they have acquired\r\n    within the walls of the Institute.”\r\n\r\nDuring 1878 was begun the erection of the new buildings from the\r\ndesigns of Mr. J. H. Chamberlain, at an estimated cost of £30,000. The\r\ngreat fire of January 11th, 1879, which utterly destroyed the Free\r\nLibraries, greatly interfered with the work, and it was not until the\r\nsummer of 1881, that the beautiful buildings fronting to Paradise\r\nStreet, were ready for occupation. The burden of the heavy debt\r\nincurred was somewhat lightened by the prospects of a bequest, subject\r\nto two lives, of £50,000.\r\n\r\nHitherto, the annual examination of the classes which did not fall\r\nunder the Science and Art Departments had been conducted by volunteers.\r\nAn endeavour was made in 1880 to induce the Senate of the London\r\nUniversity to undertake this work. The Senate did not see its way to\r\ndo this, but it suggested that the council should apply to the Rev.\r\nPhilip Magnus, one of the University Examiners, and later a member\r\nof the Commission on Technical Education. Mr. Magnus undertook the\r\nduty, and the plan has been retained since then, the standard for\r\nthe council certificate being made as nearly as possible that of the\r\nmatriculation examinations at London. In this year was founded the\r\nInstitute Union of Teachers and Students, and it was now, too, that the\r\nInstitute gave birth to a number of local institutes, environing the\r\ntown in a continuous chain, formed on the lines of the parent body,\r\nand serving local requirements.[30] During 1882, a musical section\r\nwas begun, with 157 members, and an instrumental class with 500. A\r\nstill more noteworthy movement was the establishment of a class in\r\npractical metallurgy. During the following year this had developed\r\ninto an excellent laboratory, furnaces, balance room, fume chambers,\r\nand benches for twenty-three students; the class being under the\r\ncare of Mr. A. H. Hiorns. A new class was also formed in iron and\r\nsteel, in connection with the City and Guilds of London Institute.\r\nThe council co-operated, too, in organizing a course of lectures on\r\nHealth by eminent medical men in the town, similar to those delivered\r\nin Edinburgh and elsewhere, and these have since been an annual\r\ninstitution. During this fruitful year were founded the Institute\r\nMagazine, and the Debating, Dramatic, and Literary Sections. An\r\nArchæological Section, still in full vitality, had been organized as\r\nearly as 1870, and continues to issue quarto volumes of Transactions,\r\ncontaining the Papers read, with original illustrations and records of\r\nexcursions to local and other places of archæological interests.\r\n\r\nFruitful, however, though this year of 1883 was, it stands out as one\r\npeculiarly sad in the Institute history, for during it took place the\r\nsudden death of Mr. John Henry Chamberlain, who as Hon. Secretary\r\nsince 1865, had continuously devoted himself to its interest. In the\r\nwords of the Report for 1883, “Under his guidance the Institute had\r\nundergone development which is truly marvellous … he had genius to see\r\nthe needs of the time, and the direction in which the Institute could\r\nbe developed to meet them.… The wisdom of his counsel, the extent\r\nand variety of his knowledge, the grace of his eloquence, and the\r\nwonderful charm of his personal presence, made him a colleague whom it\r\nis impossible to replace. He expired almost in the act of serving the\r\nInstitute.”\r\n\r\nDuring 1884, a meteorological observatory was formed at the Monument,\r\nin Monument Road, an anemometer being erected there at the cost\r\nof Mr. Follett Osler, and the Birmingham Chess Club became a new\r\nsection of the Institute. In 1885, the School of Art was removed\r\nfrom the Institute Buildings, where it had hitherto found a home, to\r\nthe beautiful building in Edmund Street erected by the town for its\r\nreception. This gave great additional space, sorely needed, for the\r\nindustrial department, and, on the initiative of Mr. G. H. Kenrick, it\r\nwas at once utilised, at a cost of £2,000 (guaranteed by Mr. Kenrick)\r\nfor a great expansion of the metallurgical classes. An engineering\r\nworkshop was formed, and the laboratory greatly increased, so that\r\nthe Institute now possesses--and it is perhaps its most interesting\r\nfeature--the most extensive metallurgical school in Great Britain,\r\none indeed well-nigh worthy of the position of Birmingham in the\r\nmanufacturing world. In this year too, classes in singing and in the\r\npractice of several musical instruments were formed, the violin class\r\nbeing particularly successful. And a teachers’ board was established,\r\nfrom which valuable suggestions are offered to the council for\r\nimprovements in the education given to the classes.\r\n\r\nThe following figures are worth recording. In 1854, there were _one_\r\nmember[31] and 165 students; in 1874, 1591 members, and 2179 students;\r\nin 1886, 1927 members, and (in the central and branch classes) 4190\r\nstudents, thus distributed: science, 1474; language and literature,\r\n1046; arithmetic, 324; matriculation, 13; music, 1233; ladies 100.\r\n\r\n=Elementary Education.=--The work performed by the School Board\r\nmay be best realized from the following figures. Previous to the\r\npassing of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, there were within\r\nthe Borough public elementary schools with accommodation for 28,983\r\nchildren, and shortly afterwards further accommodation was made for\r\n1,476; so that in round numbers there were places for about 30,000\r\nchildren. There were also the so called elementary schools on the King\r\nEdward VI.’s foundation, noticed under that head, and a few private\r\nadventure schools. The official enquiry of 1871 showed, however, that\r\naccommodation was then necessary for 55,000, so that even then the town\r\nwas scarcely more than half supplied. But, further, this half supply\r\nwas but half utilized, since the average attendance in the schools was\r\nonly about 16,000.\r\n\r\nDuring the fifteen years of its existence the School Board has\r\nprovided thirty-two large sets of new buildings, most of them with\r\nextensive playgrounds, and it also occupies three sets of school\r\npremises which are rented. The total accommodation provided in\r\nthese schools is sufficient for 35,277 children; while that in the\r\nDenominational Schools is now about the same as in 1871, the total\r\nbeing 29,141. A few certified efficient schools accommodate 794\r\nchildren; so that there is at the present date a total accommodation\r\nof 65,212, or more than double that of 1871. Still more remarkable is\r\nthe change wrought in the average attendance. In 1871 this was 50.3\r\nper cent. of the number on the books. In other words, out of every 100\r\nplaces provided 50 were vacant. The average attendance is now 85 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nEven now the accommodation provided does not reach that required. The\r\npopulation being 420,000 there should be places for one-sixth of that\r\nnumber, according to the government scale, that is for 70,000. Thus the\r\nBoard is still behind-hand to the amount of 5,000 places. Moreover,\r\naccording to the average of the last eight years, the population of the\r\nBorough is increasing at the rate of 60,000 per annum, and consequently\r\nthe accommodation required at the rate of 1,000 per annum. In other\r\nwords, the Board has to provide five new schools to catch up the\r\npresent deficit, and one school every year to keep pace with the yearly\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nBesides the schools whose curriculum is confined to the subjects named\r\nin the New Code, the Board has established, upon the initiative and\r\nin a great measure at the cost of the Chairman, George Dixon, Esq.,\r\nM.P., a Technical School for boys in the 7th standard, which provides\r\nan education in elementary science, machine construction, &c.; and\r\nwhich is furnished with a large chemical laboratory, and an admirably\r\nfitted lecture room, a special room for teaching technical drawing,\r\nand a workshop in which the boys are trained to the use of tools and\r\nto working from scale. This school, which is well worth a visit, is\r\nin Bridge Street, five minutes’ walk from the Town Hall, in premises\r\nhanded over to the Board, rent free, and partially fitted up by Mr.\r\nDixon.\r\n\r\nMany of the Board Schools form real architectural ornaments of the\r\ntown. They are in three stages of design, the earliest being that in\r\nwhich boys, girls, and infants form separate departments, the boys and\r\nthe infants being usually on the ground floor, the girls on the floor\r\nabove the boys. In the second stage a large centre hall is surrounded\r\nby class-rooms on the ground floor; half way to the roof runs a\r\ngallery, from which doors open into another set of class-rooms. The\r\ninfants are on the ground floor (except in Hope Street), in a separate\r\npart of the building; the whole school being under the supervision of a\r\nmaster. In the last stage everything is on the ground floor. The latest\r\nerected buildings of this stage are models of airiness and light. The\r\nspecimens of the three styles easiest reached and most worth seeing are\r\nrespectively Bristol Street, Icknield Street, and Stratford Road or\r\nFoundry Road.\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed that half-time scholars are now almost unknown,\r\nalthough the conditions of life would seem to point to a wide extension\r\nof the system.\r\n\r\nA few scholarships, far fewer than could be wished, are at the disposal\r\nof the Board. They are of three classes, Major, Elementary Science,\r\nand Minor. Boys who hold the Wright, Piddock, and J. H. Chamberlain\r\nMemorial Scholarships receive £15 a year, on certain conditions, during\r\na two years’ course at King Edward’s School, and £25 a year, with\r\nremittance of fees, for three years more at Mason College. Several\r\nElementary Science Scholarships, in connection with the Science and Art\r\nDepartment, have hitherto been provided out of a fund called the Higher\r\nEducation Fund, raised for the purpose of assisting poor but deserving\r\nscholars, by which a grant of £5 is guaranteed, with an additional £5\r\non passing a good examination under the Science and Art Department. It\r\nis greatly to be regretted that the funds raised for providing Minor\r\nScholarships are all exhausted, except the Chamberlain and Edgbaston\r\nDay School for Girls Trust Funds.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of the Board’s work, when a Church majority was\r\nelected, religious education was given in the Birmingham schools. Upon\r\nthe accession of the Liberal and Non-Conformist party to power such\r\neducation was entirely done away with. The result of frequent and\r\nsomewhat bitter controversy has been that at present a small portion of\r\nthe Bible is read each day by the head teacher without note or comment.\r\n\r\nThe Voluntary Schools have, up till quite recently, had no common\r\norganization. There has now, however, been formed an Association of\r\nVoluntary School Managers, under whose auspices it is proposed to\r\nundertake some amount of inspection, and which will frame and discuss\r\nall measures directed to their common welfare. The Chairman is the Rev.\r\nCanon Bowlby, Rector of St. Philip’s.\r\n\r\n=Municipal School of Art.=--[By Mr. E. R. TAYLOR, Head Master.]--The\r\nSociety of Arts and School of Art were, in June, 1885, transferred to\r\nthe Corporation under the above title. This Society was established\r\nat a meeting held in the Public Office, Moor Street, on 7th February,\r\n1821, at which it was resolved:--(1.) “That an Institution be\r\nnow established in Birmingham for the encouragement of arts and\r\nmanufactures, and that it be called ‘The Birmingham Society of Arts.’”\r\n(2.) “That a Museum be formed for the reception of the most approved\r\nspecimens of sculpture, and of all such other works illustrative\r\nof the different branches of Art as the Society may have the means\r\nof procuring.” (3.) “That suitable accommodation be provided for\r\nstudents.” A subscription list was forthwith opened, and Sir Robert\r\nLawley, Bart., gave in addition a valuable collection of casts from the\r\nantique. The Museum thus formed was opened for members and students\r\nin May, 1822, and in 1827 the first annual exhibition of pictures\r\nwas held. In 1829 the Society erected the galleries in New Street,\r\nnow occupied by the Royal Society of Artists, and in this year the\r\nfirst conversazione of the Society of Arts took place. Until 1842\r\nthe Society was managed by a joint committee, composed of lay and\r\nprofessional members with equal powers. The lay committee, representing\r\nthe subscribers, were desirous of furthering the original intention\r\nof providing means for art education by applying for aid from the\r\nGovernment School of Design, newly formed in London. Hitherto the\r\nteaching had been carried on by the members of the professional, or\r\nartists’ committee, who acted as visitors to the School for Drawing\r\nfrom the Antique. The school was open on two evenings in each week, but\r\nthe average nightly attendance was only fourteen.\r\n\r\nThe professional committee demurred against these proposed changes,\r\nand, on their being adopted by the subscribers, withdrew from the\r\nSociety, and afterwards formed the present Royal Society of Artists. In\r\n1843, Mr. Dobson, who is now an Associate of the Royal Academy, became\r\nthe first Head Master, and the title of the Society was at this time\r\naltered to “The Society of Arts and School of Design.”\r\n\r\nIn 1845, Mr. Heavyside succeeded Mr. Dobson, but held the office for a\r\nyear only, being in turn succeeded by Mr. Thos. Clarke. The number of\r\nstudents at this time was 448.\r\n\r\nMr. George Wallis became Head Master in 1851, and introduced many\r\nchanges in the organization and work of the school. He resigned in\r\n1857, Mr. D. Raimbach being his successor.\r\n\r\nBy an agreement between the Society of Artists and the Council of the\r\nnewly founded Birmingham and Midland Institute, the latter undertook to\r\nprovide double the existing accommodation for the Society of Arts in\r\ntheir proposed building; and the school was transferred in the summer\r\nof 1858 to the rooms which it continued to occupy until last year.\r\n\r\nThe record of the school from the first seems to be one of continuously\r\nincreasing success; for in 1864 the number of students had more than\r\ndoubled, being 939, including elementary and advanced classes.\r\n\r\nIn its early days the school was much indebted to the Rev. James Prince\r\nLee, M.A., who held the post of Chairman until he was removed to the\r\nSee of Manchester, and in more recent times to the late Mr. John Henry\r\nChamberlain, Chairman, and Mr. Edwin Smith, Secretary.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the whole of the elementary teaching in the evening was\r\ntransferred to branch classes held in Board Schools.\r\n\r\nA most generous offer was made to the school in 1876. An anonymous\r\ndonor placed the sum of £10,000 at the disposal of the Committee, with\r\na request that it should be chiefly, if not altogether, employed in\r\nthe improvement of the teaching department, and in the foundation of\r\nscholarships or exhibitions.\r\n\r\nOn the resignation of Mr. Raimbach, the present Head Master (Mr.\r\nEdward R. Taylor) was appointed in May, 1877. In the year 1880 a scheme\r\nwas initiated by a donation of £5,000 from Messrs. Richard and George\r\nTangye, which has resulted in the present Museum and Art Gallery, with\r\nits noble collection of pictures and objects of industrial art, the\r\ngifts of wealthy citizens to the town. The increasing difficulties\r\nunder which the School of Art laboured in providing room for the\r\neducation by which alone these art treasures could be made of use to\r\nthe town were not lost sight of, and in 1881 the Mayor (Mr. Richard\r\nChamberlain, M.P.) was enabled to announce to the Corporation that\r\nland would be given by Mr. Cregoe Colmore, in the centre of the town,\r\non which to build a School of Art, and that Miss Ryland would give\r\n£10,000, and Messrs. Richard and George Tangye would also give £10,000\r\ntowards the cost of building a School on condition that the Town\r\nCouncil would undertake its management. The result of this generosity\r\nis the beautiful building in Margaret Street, the last work of the\r\nlate Mr. J. H. Chamberlain, who had for many years acted as Chairman\r\nof the School, and had taken the deepest interest in its success. It\r\nmay fairly claim to be one of the best schools of art ever erected.\r\nThe lighting is bright and cheerful, furnishing in this a contrast to\r\nmost of such institutions; and the accommodation, especially for the\r\nmodelling classes and those for studies bearing on design, is most\r\nample, and a great improvement on that given in the old premises.\r\n\r\nIn the Central and Branch Schools there are this Session 733 students,\r\nand in the seven Branch Schools 706 students, mostly artisans. The\r\nfollowing are some of their occupations:--\r\n\r\n  Architects & Assistants            41\r\n  Art Students                       57\r\n  Art Teachers                       15\r\n  Artists                             7\r\n  Brassfounders & Workers            40\r\n  Cabinet Makers                      7\r\n  Carpenters and Joiners             28\r\n  Clerks and Office Boys             94\r\n  Designers                          11\r\n  Die Sinkers                        54\r\n  Draughtsmen                        36\r\n  Engineers, Fitters, and Turners    88\r\n  Engravers, Embossers, and Chasers  49\r\n  Glass Painters                     27\r\n  Glass Cutters                       9\r\n  Japanners                           5\r\n  Jewellers & Silversmiths           37\r\n  Lithographers                      40\r\n  Modellers                           8\r\n  Nail Cutters                        9\r\n  Pattern Makers                     12\r\n  Photographers                       6\r\n  Teachers                          103\r\n  Turners                             6\r\n  Tool Makers                         6\r\n  Watchmakers                         7\r\n  Wood Carvers                        3\r\n\r\nThirty-four other trades are also represented, besides the children of\r\nartisans.\r\n\r\nThe Awards of the Science and Art Department to the school in 1877 and\r\nin 1885, will shew the more recent progress of the school.\r\n\r\n  1877, Medals, Prizes, and Scholarships,  110\r\n  1885    ”       ”             ”          320\r\n  1877, Certificates                       157\r\n  1885         ”                           658\r\n\r\nOf these prizes and certificates, 40 prizes and 273 certificates were\r\nlast year awarded for examinations in the advanced sections, including\r\npainting, design, drawing from the figure, modelling the figure,\r\nhistory of ornament, anatomy, etc.; the total of awards obtained by all\r\nthe 198 Schools of Art in the United Kingdom being only 205 prizes, and\r\n1,924 certificates.\r\n\r\nBy the munificence of “the anonymous donor,” the Corporation are\r\nenabled to offer the following free admissions and scholarships tenable\r\nin the school for two years:--\r\n\r\nEighty free admissions to the Branch Schools; Fifty free admissions to\r\nthe Central Schools; Ten scholarships of £5 per annum; Two scholarships\r\nof £20 per annum; Two scholarships of £40 per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nLIBRARIES: PAST AND PRESENT.\r\n\r\nBY J. D. MULLINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The first Public Library, 1733=, was one which still exists, and was\r\nfounded by the Rev. W. Higgs, first Rector of St. Philip’s, who left\r\nhis Library and a sum of money for a Parochial Library “free to all\r\nClergymen of the Church of England in the town and neighbourhood of\r\nBirmingham, and of all other students who shall be recommended either\r\nby the Rector of St. Philip’s, or the Rector of St. Martin’s, in\r\nBirmingham, or the Rector of Sheldon, near Birmingham,” and which was\r\n“designed for the encouragement and promotion of useful Literature,\r\nmore especially of theological learning.” The books were to be lent out\r\nat the discretion of the Trustees to suitable persons, and a folio was\r\nto be kept six weeks, a quarto one month, and an octavo or duodecimo\r\nfourteen days. The Endowment was £200 in 3 per cents., and it was\r\nannounced that donations would be very acceptable “for the increase of\r\nthe Library,” as no payment was required for admission to the use of\r\nit. The Library was long kept in a room adjoining St. Philip’s Rectory,\r\n(and is duly provided for in the New Rectory) and deserves this mention\r\nas the first Free Library in our town.\r\n\r\n=Subscription Libraries.=--Subscription Libraries had been established\r\nby William Hutton in Bull Street (in 1751), Joseph Crompton in Colmore\r\nRow, and others in the latter half of the last century, but the most\r\nimportant was that of John Lowe, at the Stamp Office in Cherry Street,\r\nwhich was established in 1776, and the catalogue of which in 1796\r\nincluded 103 pages; and more than 10,000 Standard Books, to which the\r\nprice of each was added in case of a purchase. The annual subscriptions\r\nwere 16/- or a guinea according to the privileges, and not only were\r\nquarterly subscribers taken, but non-subscribers could have books to\r\nread on depositing their value, at twopence per volume per week; or if\r\nover four shillings in value at threepence per volume per week. And\r\nthe Library was to be open from eight o’clock in the morning till nine\r\no’clock in the evening. It is to the credit of the readers of a century\r\nago that a large number of French books were provided for their use.\r\n\r\nIn 1787 a Subscription Library was opened at 13 Suffolk Street, by M.\r\nand S. Olds. The subscription was 12/- per year, 7/- the half year, and\r\n4/- the quarter.\r\n\r\n=The Birmingham (Old) Library= was founded about November, 1779,\r\n(though the exact place of its origination is not known), by nineteen\r\nsubscribers, nearly all being Dissenters, in fact, only one being\r\na member of the Established Church. The proposal was made to the\r\nlaity generally, and to some of the Clergy, several of whom became\r\nmembers when the Library had become a success. It was founded on\r\nbroad principles to supply the numerous readers with books, which few\r\nprivate persons could afford to buy, and it was based on principles\r\nso sound that it has been highly successful, and has been one of the\r\nmost prosperous and long-lived of all provincial Libraries. At first,\r\nits progress seems to have been slow, and its history obscure; but\r\non the arrival of Dr. Priestley in Birmingham, in 1780, its real\r\nprosperity commenced. His experience of a similar Library at Leeds,\r\nand his characteristic energy and enthusiasm were given to the young\r\nInstitution. He not only wrote the various advertisements which\r\nappeared, but he drew up a code of laws on the principle adopted at\r\nLeeds, and the best testimony to their merit is that they have been\r\nsubstantially without important changes for 100 years.\r\n\r\nThe books were to be bought by a Committee of twenty chosen annually.\r\nThe Laws could be made or repealed only at an Annual Meeting or by\r\nspecial notice. Books were to be proposed by the Subscribers, and\r\nselected by the Committee. The plan proved highly successful, and the\r\nSubscribers rapidly increased. The entrance fee was One Guinea, and the\r\nSubscription Six Shillings a year, raised to Eight Shillings in 1781.\r\nThe Librarian was paid £10 a year, attendance 2 to 5 p.m.\r\n\r\nDuring the first two years the Library had its home at the house of Mr.\r\nJohn Lee, junr., 115, Snow Hill, but was afterwards removed to Messrs.\r\nPearson and Rollason’s, Swan Yard, High Street. By January, 1782, a\r\nLibrary Room was taken, and the books removed there, “hours 2 to 5,”\r\nwithin those hours any Subscriber might see the books, read and make\r\nextracts, etc., at his pleasure; in 1785, eleven to one was added to\r\nthe hours.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, May 5th, the Library was re-opened at the Upper Priory (late\r\nMr. Payton’s Repository)[32] with 4,000 volumes. About this time a plan\r\nwas started to build a Library on a Tontine System of 181 shares, “near\r\nto a street called Cherry Street, and then lately used as a Bowling\r\nGreen, formerly called Corbett’s Bowling Green.” An extension doubling\r\nthe area of the Library Buildings was made about 1843.\r\n\r\nAt its Centenary, 1879, this Library contained 50,000 volumes. It has\r\nnow (1886) 1,591 proprietors and subscribers; an annual income of\r\n£1,680; an expenditure of £1,531; and 984 volumes were added to the\r\nLibrary in 1885. The Librarian is Mr. C. E. Scarse.\r\n\r\n=Birmingham New Library.=--In 1794 the New Library was founded by some\r\nwho were dissatisfied with the management of the Parent Institution.\r\nThe Laws of the Old Library were adopted, with two exceptions. It\r\nwas originally started in Cannon Street. Rooms were then built on\r\nthe Tontine plan, in Temple Row West, where the Joint Stock Bank now\r\nstands, and after a more or less successful career the New Library was\r\namalgamated with the Union Street or Old Birmingham Library in 1860.\r\n\r\n=The Medical Library and Institute.=--This Library was formed in 1790\r\nat a meeting at the Union Tavern in Cherry Street, and remained for\r\nmany years as part of the Old Birmingham Library, accessible to the\r\nordinary subscribers, but on the formation of the Medical Institute,\r\nin 1878, the books were given up to the promoters of the Institute. It\r\nis now a library of some 11,500 vols. at the new building in Edmund\r\nStreet. Mr. T. G. Johnson is the Librarian. The Institute is supported\r\nby the chief medical men of the town and neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n=The Birmingham Law Library= was founded in 1831, by the Barristers\r\nand Attorneys practising in Birmingham and the neighbourhood. This is\r\nsupported by annual subscriptions. It contains nearly 6,000 volumes of\r\nLaw Works, Reports, Acts, etc. It is in Wellington Passage, Bennett’s\r\nHill. An admirable Catalogue of this Library has been compiled by Mr.\r\nThomas Horton.\r\n\r\n=The Mason College= in Edmund Street, opened in 1880, has now a very\r\nchoice Scientific Library. It is especially rich in English and Foreign\r\nSerials, Transactions, Journals, Magazines, Reviews, Reports, etc., of\r\nwhich Mr. S. Allport the Librarian published a Catalogue in 1883. It\r\nowes much of its high character to the late Dr. Heslop, who took great\r\ninterest in its formation and gave three-fourths of the books.\r\n\r\n=Other Libraries.=--Among the Libraries of the past should be recorded:\r\n(1) The Mechanics’ Institution founded in 1826, and carried on till\r\n1842. It had a Reference and Circulating Library with a Reading Room\r\nfor the use of the members. (2) The Artisans’ Library, founded in 1831,\r\nopen three evenings a week. Of smaller Libraries, the Parochial one of\r\nSt. Martin’s, founded by the Rector (Dr. Miller) in 1850, was far above\r\nthe average character of such Institutions; it was located in Inge\r\nStreet, and was much used.\r\n\r\n=News Rooms=, either with Libraries or alone, were not numerous in the\r\nearly part of this century. In August, 1808, the first subscription\r\nNews Room appears to have been opened at Messrs. Thomson and\r\nWrightson’s Stamp Office, New Street, open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Four\r\nLondon Daily Papers, Lloyd’s List, Prices Current, one Sunday, three\r\nProvincial, and three Birmingham Papers, with Reviews and Magazines\r\nwere provided.\r\n\r\n=A Commercial News Room= was established in 1823, by a number of\r\ngentlemen, who took Shares of £20 each to erect a Building and carry on\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\n=A News Room= of large size and importance was built in 1825, in\r\nWaterloo Street, corner of Bennett’s Hill, where the old County\r\nCourt stood, and where the Inland Revenue Office now stands. As this\r\ncontained all the leading London Periodicals and Foreign Newspapers,\r\nShipping, Commercial and Law Intelligence, files of important Papers,\r\nLondon Gazette, Times and local Journals, it may almost be included\r\namong our Libraries.\r\n\r\nAs a contrast with this, the only News Room of that time, there are\r\nnow _Nine_, in addition to the Reference Reading Room, viz.:--_Three\r\nSubscription_, the Old Library, the Midland Institute, and the Exchange\r\nrespectively, and six _free News Rooms_, viz., the Central News Room,\r\nand five Branches in different parts of the town.\r\n\r\n=The Free Libraries of Birmingham.=--These were originated, and are\r\nsustained, by the municipality, at the cost of the ratepayers, by\r\nthe levying of a rate of a little over one penny in the pound on the\r\nrents or rateable value of the Borough. This rate produces £9,500 a\r\nyear and maintains the principal or Central Libraries, which include\r\nReference Department of 80,000 volumes, Central Lending Library of\r\n25,000 volumes, and a News Room used regularly by about 5,000 readers a\r\nday. It also maintains three Branch Libraries of 10,000 volumes each,\r\nwith capacious and well supplied News Rooms, and two others of smaller\r\ndimensions opened only at night. Altogether these various departments\r\nissue more than 2,000 volumes, and accommodate in the Reading and News\r\nRooms more than 11,000 readers _daily_.\r\n\r\nThese Free Libraries were commenced tentatively and modestly in a\r\nleased house and shopping in Constitution Hill (or Northern part) in\r\n1861, some doubts apparently existing then whether such institutions\r\nwere really needed or would be appreciated here.\r\n\r\nThe Library commenced with 6,000 volumes, and an issue for the first\r\nyear of 108,000. _Now_ there are nearly 140,000 volumes available, with\r\nan issue of 844,000 per annum, and one of the most urgent pleas on\r\nbehalf of and _by_ the population now before the Town Council is for\r\n_more_ Free Libraries.\r\n\r\nSo strong is the desire for the privileges these Libraries afford, that\r\nat Ward Elections the question has been asked of Councillors as a test\r\nof political fitness: “Will you vote for a Free Library and News Room\r\nfor this Ward?”\r\n\r\nThis general willingness of the people to be taxed for the higher\r\nbenefits of knowledge and culture for themselves and their children is\r\nsufficiently novel to be worthy of notice.\r\n\r\nThe success of the experiment at Constitution Hill induced the Free\r\nLibraries’ Committee to prepare plans on a scale commensurate with the\r\ndemands of the Town, and it was resolved to commence the Central and\r\nWestern Libraries consisting of Reference Department and Reading Room,\r\nCentral Lending Library and News Room, and to provide Branch Libraries\r\nand News Rooms for the Eastern District at Gosta Green, and for the\r\nSouthern District at Deritend.\r\n\r\nThis plan has since been extended to provide Libraries and News Rooms\r\nat Nechells, Small Heath, and Spring Hill, (these three have yet to\r\nbe built). The small and incommodious Room at Constitution Hill or\r\nNorthern District, the starting point in 1861 of the Libraries, was\r\nsuperseded by a large and handsome building in July 1883. The cost of\r\nthese buildings was defrayed from loans borrowed on the system of an\r\nannual repayment of loan and interest in one hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe first Reference Library of 16,000 volumes, with the Central\r\nLending Department and News Room, was opened in October, 1866, and an\r\neloquent and original address by the late George Dawson, declared these\r\nLibraries open and free for ever, and started them on their course of\r\nusefulness. As regards the character of books read, it may be said that\r\nby far the largest demand in the Reference Library is for books of\r\npractical value in Science and Art, and that the taste for Scientific\r\nWorks in the Lending Libraries is steadily growing, and the Committee\r\nare only too glad to meet the demand.\r\n\r\nThese Free Lending Libraries seem to reach all classes with their\r\nelevating and gladdening influence. There are not only books for the\r\nstudent and worker by which they may be helped in the business of life,\r\nbut there are books for the weary, books of standard music, books for\r\nlittle children, and even books for the blind.\r\n\r\nThe History of the Libraries has been, with one exception, an unbroken\r\nrecord of success, and what a world of happiness and growth twenty-five\r\nyears of successful Library work means it is very difficult to measure\r\nor estimate.\r\n\r\nThe exception was the calamitous fire which occurred on January 11,\r\n1879. The Building was in process of enlargement, and had been to\r\na considerable extent given up into the builders’ hands during its\r\nreconstruction. A strong wall had given place for the time being--to\r\navoid the closing of the Reference Library and News Room during the\r\nalterations--to temporary arrangements of wood and similar material.\r\nThe winter was severe, the gas was frozen, an energetic workman in\r\nattempting to produce a thaw ignited a flame which blazed up beyond his\r\ncontrol, set fire to the temporary screen dividing the existing Library\r\nfrom the extension, and, spreading to the adjoining shelves, soon\r\nembraced the whole of the Library in one vast blaze. As this occurred\r\nat mid-day on a Saturday, the Rooms of the Library were crowded with\r\nReaders, but no one was injured. All sorts and conditions of men strove\r\nto save what could be saved of the precious books, but the fire was\r\nmaster, and the salvage was small. The pride the people had in _their_\r\nFree Library, and their grief at its destruction were shewn in a most\r\npathetic manner, books being offered from their own collections, great\r\nand small, toward the restoration. Nor was this feeling confined to the\r\ntown. Her Majesty sent a note through Lieutenant-General Ponsonby, in\r\nwhich she offered a valuable selection of books as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                “Buckingham Palace, March 24, 1879.\r\n\r\n    Sir,\r\n\r\n    I am commanded by the Queen to enquire if the Managers of the\r\n    Birmingham Library will accept from Her Majesty the volumes, a\r\n    list of which I enclose.\r\n\r\n    Not being certain to whom I should address myself, I have\r\n    ventured to trouble you with this letter, in the hope that you\r\n    will communicate the Queen’s offer in the proper quarter.\r\n\r\n    I have the honour to be, Sir,\r\n        Your obedient servant,\r\n            HENRY F. PONSONBY.”\r\n\r\n    “The Mayor of Birmingham.”\r\n\r\nThe books offered were:\r\n\r\nLepsius, (C. R.)--Denkmaeler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien. 12 vols.,\r\nlarge folio.\r\n\r\nBock, (F.)--Die Kleinodien des heiligen Römischen Reiches Deutscher\r\nNation. 1 vol., large folio. 1864.\r\n\r\nNash, (Joseph)--Windsor Castle. Folio. 1848.\r\n\r\nWyatt, (M. Digby)--The Industrial Arts of the 19th Century. 2 vols.,\r\nfolio. 1853.\r\n\r\n[These works, the noblest of their kind, and on the subjects of which\r\nthey treat, are not only costly but exceedingly useful, more especially\r\nthe fine illustrations in the “Monuments of Egypt and Ethiopia,” and\r\nthe “Art Treasures of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.”]\r\n\r\nExpressions of sympathy and gifts of books came from Germany, Italy,\r\nAmerica, and, from nearly every town in England.\r\n\r\nThe chief men of Birmingham met, and subscriptions amounting to nearly\r\n£15,000 were given to supplement the amount for which the books had\r\nbeen insured--to raise again and at once what all classes proudly and\r\nlovingly called “Our Free Library.”\r\n\r\nThe buildings in Ratcliff Place have risen again in nobler\r\nproportions, and on extended space, the rates for their support are\r\nungrudgingly given, and there is no place better used.\r\n\r\nThe issue of books extends yearly with the advance of education, and\r\ngoes on to supply that for which the school creates a demand.\r\n\r\nThe student will here find placed at his service the most complete and\r\ncostly works in art, architecture, archæology, botany, natural history,\r\nscience, theology, politics, poetry, as well as county histories, and\r\ntopographical works, and sets of all the principal weekly, monthly,\r\nquarterly and annual publications, with files of important newspapers,\r\netc., from very early periods to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe Library contains several _special_ collections:\r\n\r\nThe BYRON collection (275 vols.), given by Mr. Richard Tangye.\r\n\r\nThe CERVANTES collection (400 vols.), given by the late Mr. William\r\nBragge.\r\n\r\nThe MILTON collection (182 vols.), given by Mr. Frank Wright.\r\n\r\nA collection of local literature of unequalled extent,--the acquisition\r\nof many years by David Malins, Sam: Timmins and others--has been\r\ngenerously placed at the disposal of the town. This remarkable\r\ncollection of books, pamphlets, Acts of Parliament, maps, views of the\r\nbuildings, portraits, etc., already consists of over 6,000 articles,\r\nand is catalogued in a pamphlet of 93 pages.\r\n\r\n=The Shakespeare Memorial Library= was founded at the Tercentenary\r\nof Shakespeare’s Birth (in 1864) by the united exertions of Mr. Sam:\r\nTimmins and the late George Dawson. The original collection destroyed\r\nby the fire has been restored to more than its former proportions,\r\nand now consists of upwards of 7,000 volumes, editions, plays, and\r\nShakespeariana in twenty-six languages, including the first four folio\r\neditions of Shakespeare’s Works, and nearly every edition issued\r\nsince, as well as various translations from all parts of the world.\r\nThis collection, like the rest of the Library is open to all students\r\nfree, and is largely used, students of Shakespeare coming here from\r\nCambridge, Dublin, and even from Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe disastrous fire of 1879 destroyed the larger part of the Cervantes\r\nLibrary, and of the splendid Staunton Collection of Warwickshire Books,\r\nManuscripts, Engravings, Portraits, etc., but these are being replaced\r\nas fully as possible by gifts and purchases as opportunities occur.\r\n\r\n=The Reference Library= (only) has been opened on Sundays, from 3 to 9,\r\nsince April, 1872, and is generally well used. The readers are supplied\r\nwith books by six Assistants, of whom five are Jews.\r\n\r\n=Suburban Libraries.=--The influence of the Birmingham Free Libraries\r\nhas not been confined to the boundaries of the Borough. In the spirited\r\nsuburban Manor of Aston a Free Library was established in May 1877;\r\nthis was followed by Handsworth in 1880; and both these Suburbs have\r\nhandsome provision made in the public buildings, for good Libraries\r\nand News Rooms. The Librarian of Aston Manor Free Library is Mr. R. K.\r\nDent, the author of “Old and New Birmingham,” and Mr. J. W. Roberts is\r\nthe Librarian of Handsworth.\r\n\r\nWithin a circle of ten or twelve miles there are substantial Free\r\nLibraries at Darlaston, Dudley, Bilston, Brierley Hill, Smethwick, West\r\nBromwich, Walsall, Wednesbury and Willenhall; and within a little wider\r\nradius will be found the Free Libraries of Burslem, Coventry, Hanley,\r\nKidderminster, Leamington, Lichfield, Tamworth, Tipton, Wolverhampton,\r\nand Worcester; a larger number within such an area than will be found\r\nin any other part of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n    The brief account here given is compiled from the following\r\n    works, in each of which further details of interest may be\r\n    found:--\r\n\r\n    Hutton’s History of Birmingham. Sixth Edition, 1835.\r\n\r\n    Langford’s Century of Birmingham Life, 1868.\r\n\r\n    Langford’s Modern Birmingham and its Institutions, 1873-1877.\r\n\r\n    Dawson’s Inaugural Address at opening of Reference Library,\r\n    1866.\r\n\r\n    Dent’s Old and New Birmingham, 1880.\r\n\r\n    Centenary of the Birmingham Library, by Sam: Timmins, 1879.\r\n\r\n    Showell’s Dictionary of Birmingham, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nLITERARY, SCIENTIFIC AND ARTISTIC SOCIETIES.\r\n\r\nBY SAM: TIMMINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chapter II., on “Education,” has included the more active and\r\nvaluable societies which have developed into important organizations\r\nfor the full and regular teaching of Literature, Science, and Art,\r\nbut it has been thought desirable to give a brief summary of the\r\nlocal societies which for nearly a century have assisted in creating\r\nthe demand which the larger institutions have been established to\r\nsupply. Birmingham has not been so remarkable as some other towns for\r\nits societies formed of lovers of literature and science, and it is\r\ncertainly remarkable, and almost reprehensible, that so large a centre\r\nhas never had a definite Literary Society or Literary Club, associating\r\nall, and they are many, who are lovers of books in all departments,\r\nand not merely of literature of a scientific, technical, and practical\r\nkind. Such a society, or such a club, should certainly exist in a great\r\nMidland town, as in Manchester, Liverpool, and other places.\r\n\r\n=The Lunar Society= of the last century, which included among its\r\nmembers or visitors, Priestley, Boulton, Watt, Darwin, Withering,\r\nKeir, Galton, Sir Joseph Banks, Smeaton, Edgeworth, Day, Wedgwood,\r\nBaskerville, was founded about 1765, and as the houses of the members\r\nwere distant from each other, and the roads dark and sometimes\r\ndangerous at night, the meetings were held at “full moon,” hence\r\n“The Lunatics” or “Lunar Society” derived its name. Its objects were\r\nsocial and scientific rather than literary and it has left no literary\r\nmemorials of its meetings.\r\n\r\n=Debating Societies.=--Among the earliest of the societies, common\r\nin later days, and which were the more needful when newspapers were\r\nfew, were the Debating Societies, the first of which, the “Robin Hood\r\nFree Debating Society,” was a tavern-society, founded in 1774, and\r\nwas followed in the same year by another, and probably a rival, or\r\nseceded body, as a “Society for the Encouragement of Free and Candid\r\nDisputation,” but both soon discussed themselves out of existence. In\r\n1789 a “Society for Free Debate” was formed, and like the others it\r\ndiscussed social, moral, and political questions, so that in 1792 the\r\nmagistrates interfered, on the ground that the recent riots should\r\ndiscourage public discussions of dangerous subjects.\r\n\r\n=Philosophical Institution.=--At the close of the century, about the\r\nyear 1794, a Philosophic and Artistic Society was proposed, and in\r\n1800 the first steps were taken to found the Birmingham Philosophical\r\nInstitution, which was so successful that, in 1813, a suitable\r\nbuilding, with a lecture room for two hundred hearers, a news room, a\r\nmuseum, and other necessary rooms, were erected, and were opened by a\r\nlecture by Rev. J. Corrie, a friend and biographer of Priestley, in\r\nOctober, 1814. This society flourished for many years, with lectures\r\nfrom eminent men, a good library and museum, and was finally succeeded\r\nby the Midland Institute on a much larger and more popular scale. One\r\nof its notable practical uses was the erection of Mr. Follett Osler’s\r\nfirst Anemometer, and excellent Clock for public convenience. For many\r\nyears papers were read and discussed by members, and published in\r\nTransactions in which meteorological, industrial, and scientific facts\r\nof historic importance have been preserved.\r\n\r\n=Society of Arts and Exhibitions.=--In April, 1814, the “artists\r\nand amateurs,” proposed to form a society, and to hold an annual\r\nexhibition of pictures, and the promoters secured as honorary members,\r\nBenjamin West, Sir J. Soane, J. M. W. Turner, John Flaxman, and\r\nRichard Westmacott. The first exhibition was held in the “Academy\r\nof Arts,”--a building still remaining in Union Passage--and proved\r\nvery attractive. In 1821, the Artistic Society proposed to expand\r\nand to form a Society of Arts, and in 1822, the site of the present\r\nlarge building (then temporary) was secured, and replaced, in 1827,\r\nby a permanent building, chiefly from the liberality of Sir Robert\r\nLawley, who gave a large number of casts from antique, and in that\r\nyear the first great exhibition of pictures was held. As a proof of\r\nthe necessity of such an exhibition and of such a Society, it will be\r\nworth while to quote the remarks of Catherine Hutton, the daughter of\r\nthe historian, herself a woman of good sense and good taste, since\r\nshe predicted that the proposed society would “die a natural death,”\r\nthat the “genius of the artists of Birmingham was more calculated to\r\npaint tea boards than pictures,” and that the proposed rooms would soon\r\n“serve for a Methodist Meeting House.” For more than sixty years since\r\nthat prophecy, the rooms have been used, with one interval, caused by\r\nquarrels, for a series of exhibitions of paintings and drawings, not\r\nonly in autumn, but in spring exhibitions too, which secure some of the\r\nbest pictures by the foremost artists of the day.\r\n\r\n=School of Medicine and Surgery.=--In 1828, the School of Medicine\r\nand Surgery was begun in Snow Hill, by the late W. Sands Cox, and\r\nwas finally expanded into the Queen’s College, which has been\r\nfully described, but the “Society” side of this and other similar\r\ninstitutions, was originally a series of meetings of members, and not\r\nany sort of college or school.\r\n\r\n=Mechanics’ Institute and Artisans’ Library.=--The success of Dr.\r\nBirkbeck’s popular institution in London led to the formation of a\r\nMechanics’ Institution in Birmingham, in 1825, and the establishment\r\nof an Artisan’s Library. From various causes this society was not\r\nsuccessful, but it was one of the first attempts to reach the masses of\r\nthe people with literary and scientific teaching, and numerous classes\r\nwere well taught and gave valuable help to the young men of that day.\r\nOne of the most remarkable results of the Mechanics’ Institution, and\r\none of the causes, unfortunately, of its failure, was one of the first\r\nof Industrial Exhibitions of manufactures and processes in 1840, and\r\nfollowed by a second which was financially a failure. In 1841 another\r\n“Institution” on a somewhat different plan was established under the\r\npatronage of Lord John Manners and the “Young England” party as the\r\n“Athenic Institute” for mental, moral, and physical improvement,\r\ncombined with rational amusements--athletic and others. In 1843 the\r\nPolytechnic Institution followed and was carried on successfully till\r\n1853 on rather broader lines than the Mechanics’ Institution, but it\r\nattracted rather the middle than the humbler classes, and finally\r\nfailed, to be followed by the Midland Institute as previously described.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 an important society was founded in Birmingham to advocate the\r\nestablishment of “free, secular, and compulsory” education, and this\r\ndeveloped into the “National Public School Association,” and in 1867\r\ninto the “National Education League,” which was the most important\r\nfactor in the education of the country by the agitation which resulted\r\nin the Elementary Education Act of 1870.\r\n\r\nIn 1852-53 another attempt was made to form a Literary and Scientific\r\nInstitution, to take up the work which the Mechanics’ Institution and\r\nthe Polytechnic Institution had failed to accomplish. The first public\r\nhelp given was by one of the first public readings of the Christmas\r\nCarol, by Charles Dickens, which produced for the three readings, £227.\r\n19s. 9d., and continued the interest and help which Dickens had given\r\nas President of the Polytechnic Institution some years before. From\r\nthis date the Midland Institute has most successfully provided for all\r\nclasses, by its literature and science classes, its public lectures,\r\nand its musical and archæological sections, and has become one of the\r\nmost successful of all similar institutions.\r\n\r\n=Magazines and Pamphlets.=--So early as 1764 a “Birmingham Register\r\nand Entertaining Museum” had been published on the lines of the\r\nGentleman’s Magazine, and ten years later a “Medical Miscellany”\r\nappeared which, however, did not live long, and no similar serial\r\nappeared till 1817. During the whole of this period, and especially\r\njust before or after the riots in 1791, the town was deluged with\r\npamphlets, chiefly on political subjects, and great feuds arose.\r\nThe pupils of the famous “Hazelwood School” issued the “Hazelwood\r\nMagazine,” often illustrated with etchings and lithographs from 1822\r\nto 1830, and the pupils of King Edward’s School have from time to\r\ntime had a “Magazine” of their own. This example was followed by the\r\n“Proprietary School” on two or three occasions. “The Oscotian” in\r\n1828 reached 3 vols., and was resumed later, and is still issued. For\r\nseveral years, _circa_ 1830, several Magazines devoted to the drama\r\nwere published, and were useful in their day.\r\n\r\n=Newspapers.=--The pamphlets of the last century were superseded by\r\nthe newspaper press; Birmingham, which had a “Journal” in 1731, and\r\na “Gazette” in 1741; had its first “Daily Press” in 1855, when the\r\ntaxes on knowledge were repealed, and “Daily Post” in 1857, and “Daily\r\nGazette” in 1862. In 1869, an attempt was made to establish a Midland\r\n“Illustrated News,” which continued for some two years. In the same\r\nyear the first halfpenny evening paper appeared, the “Daily Mail,” and\r\nin 1871, the “Birmingham Morning News” was established, with the late\r\nGeorge Dawson as its first editor.\r\n\r\n=Magazines.=--Magazine literature has often been attempted since 1764,\r\nbut not successfully. In 1876, the “Birmingham Examiner,” a weekly\r\nnewspaper of politics and literature was tried for some months, and\r\nabout the same time the “Medical Review,” the “Midland Naturalist,”\r\nand the “Central Literary Magazine,” were founded and flourish still.\r\nAn illustrated Magazine, “Mid-England” appeared in 1879, but failed to\r\nsecure the “Midland” readers; and the “Midland Antiquary,” devoted to\r\narchæology, genealogy, and heraldry, since 1879.\r\n\r\n=Debating Societies= have been numerous, and have generally held\r\ntheir ground, and helped to train some of the best speakers and\r\ndebaters of our day. The Birmingham Debating Society was founded in\r\n1846, and amalgamated with the Edgbaston Society in 1855. Parliamentary\r\nDebating Societies--“echoes” of the House of Commons--have been\r\ntried two or three times but without success, although flourishing\r\nfor some years. The Central Literary Association has been one of the\r\nmost long-lived and popular of debating societies, and its Magazine\r\nhas also been a marked success. In 1856 an Amateur Dramatic Club was\r\nformed, and many very excellent performances were given. A Dramatic\r\nClub, holding winter meetings, has been established since for the\r\nreading of papers, and the celebration of the Shakespeare Anniversary;\r\nand “Our Shakespeare Club” has met for more than thirty years as a\r\nsocial rather than literary club, whose chief work was to found the\r\nShakespeare Memorial Library. A Graduates Club was founded by the late\r\nDr. C. Badham for social meetings of University Graduates; a Clef Club\r\nhas recently been opened for lovers of music; the Historical Society,\r\nat Mason College, has been merged into the Philosophical Society, which\r\nmeets in the same building; the Natural History and Microscopical\r\nSociety has many and devoted members; the Law Society has its learned\r\ndiscussions; the Medical Institute has its Library and Meetings; the\r\nstudents of the Midland Institute and of Mason College have their\r\nrespective societies and magazines; the Archæological section of\r\nthe Institute has its meetings, excursions, and transactions; the\r\nNatural History Society its numerous members, and its excursions and\r\nmagazine,--all being social as well as scientific, and helping to raise\r\nthe standard of taste and knowledge among all classes of the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS.\r\n\r\nBY C.E. MATHEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Birmingham General Hospital.=--At the commencement of the second\r\nhalf of the last century, Birmingham was a small manufacturing town\r\nwith a population but little in excess of 30,000 souls. At that time\r\nno medical or surgical relief could be obtained by its suffering poor\r\nexcept at the Infirmary attached to the Workhouse. But in November,\r\n1765, Dr. Ash, an eminent member of the local medical profession,\r\ncalled a meeting of the principal inhabitants “to consider the\r\nadvisability of establishing a general hospital for the relief of the\r\nsick and lame.”\r\n\r\nA public meeting was held at the Swan, November 21, 1765, which\r\nresulted in “Benefactions” £1,555 18s. 0d. and “Annual Subscriptions”\r\n£424 10s. 0d.\r\n\r\nLittle was done (other than the creation of a building debt) until the\r\nyear 1779, when this great charity fairly entered upon its long career\r\nof humanity, usefulness, and honour.\r\n\r\nIts income in those early years was scanty, its patients few and far\r\nbetween, it had no endowment whatever. It was a privileged institution,\r\nthat is, except in cases of extreme urgency, its benefits were given\r\nonly to the holders of subscribers’ tickets.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1885, 3,545 in-patients and 38,501 out-patients were\r\ntreated at this Institution. Its subscription list amounted to £5,448;\r\nthe income of its endowments reached the respectable figure of £2,787,\r\nand the total income from all sources, ordinary and extraordinary, was\r\nnearly £15,000.\r\n\r\nIt is still in theory a privileged institution; but more than\r\ntwo-thirds of the in-patients, and more than half of the out-patients\r\nwere admitted in 1885 as “accidents and urgent cases” without\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\nIn recent years enormous improvements have been made both in the laws\r\nand in the administration of this Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe old system by which every Governor had a vote in the election of a\r\nMedical Officer has been abolished, and vacancies for the much coveted\r\nposition of Physician or Surgeon to the charity are now filled by a\r\nsufficiently large and representative Committee.\r\n\r\nThe legacies, which are very numerous, are funded to the extent of one\r\nhalf of their amount; and the annual reports are models for clearness\r\nand accuracy of information.\r\n\r\nA great extension of the hospital work has recently been made. A branch\r\nHospital for chronic cases has been established by the munificence of\r\nMr. John Jaffray, and has recently been opened by the Prince of Wales.\r\nThe Endowment Fund of this department already exceeds £30,000, and\r\nspecial subscriptions have been obtained amounting to nearly £500 a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe great Triennial Musical Festivals, which in late years have ceased\r\nto be peculiar to Birmingham, were first established in connection\r\nwith the Birmingham General Hospital. A Committee of the Governors is\r\nspecially appointed to carry out these important undertakings, and\r\nthey have spared no effort in procuring the finest music from the\r\nablest Composers, rendered by the foremost artists of the time. The\r\nElijah of Mendelssohn, the Eli and Naaman of Costa, the Light of the\r\nWorld of Sullivan, the St. Peter of Benedict, and the Redemption and\r\nMors et Vita of Gounod, are some of the great works first produced at\r\nBirmingham under the management of the “Orchestral Committee,” whose\r\naim has been on the one hand to obtain the perfection of music, and on\r\nthe other to augment the income of the Hospital.\r\n\r\nThese Festivals have been held since the year 1768, and have resulted\r\nin a net profit to the Hospital of over £120,000. Since the year 1849,\r\nthe gross receipts at any Festival have never been less than £10,000,\r\nand in one year they exceeded £16,000. In the year 1885, when the last\r\nFestival was held, the gross receipts were £13,715, and the net profit\r\naccruing to the Charity was £3,500.\r\n\r\n=The Queen’s Hospital.=--This great Hospital is the second general\r\nHospital in Birmingham. It was founded in the year 1840, in connection\r\nwith the Birmingham School of Medicine and Surgery; a School which in\r\n1843 became incorporated under the name of the “Queen’s College.”\r\n\r\nIt has an unusually large acting Medical and Surgical Staff consisting\r\nof three Physicians, four Surgeons, one Physician for Out-patients,\r\ntwo casualty Surgeons, an Ophthalmic Surgeon, a Dental Surgeon, and\r\nan Obstetric Officer. It was established as a privileged Institution,\r\nbut in the year 1875 the regulations then existing were changed, and\r\nit became a Free Hospital. From that time no privileges of any kind\r\nhave been given to subscribers, and the suffering and deserving poor\r\nhave been received and treated without any conditions or qualifications\r\nother than the urgency of their need of relief.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that since the Hospital became free, it has gained\r\ngreatly in public confidence and popularity.\r\n\r\nThe In-patients treated in 1885 were 1,944, the Out-patients were\r\n24,063. Some years ago it had a considerable endowment, but great\r\nenlargements and improvements of the Hospital were necessary, and\r\nwere carried out a few years since at a cost of £26,000, of which sum\r\n£10,000 was taken from the endowment, and the remainder was raised by\r\nan active and intelligent Committee. The present endowment is only\r\nabout £5,000. The annual income from all sources may be taken at\r\n£8,000, and the annual expenditure is about the same, though there\r\nis no doubt that with a larger income the Committee could provide\r\nin the present buildings a great increase in the number of beds,\r\nand so materially reduce the average cost per patient. The ordinary\r\nincome of a medical charity is derived from subscriptions, donations,\r\nlegacies, and the income resulting from investments. By the laws of\r\nmany charities legacies are invested, and the income only of such\r\ninvestments is applied to the annual purposes of the charity.\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s Hospital has not been able to take this course; all\r\nlegacies paid in any year being applied to the general purposes of the\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1885 the income of the Hospital was made up as\r\nfollows:--From Subscriptions £2,648, from Donations £256, from Legacies\r\n£1,621, from Registration Fees £852, from Income of Investments £197;\r\nbut these figures amount in all only to £5,574, and it has been stated\r\nthat the income of the Hospital is about £8,000 a year. How then has\r\nthe balance been obtained? In England there is no compulsory rate in\r\naid of our charitable institutions. M. Guizot left it on record that\r\nwhen he first visited this country nothing surprised him more than\r\nthe constant recurrence of the words that met him at every turn in\r\nLondon--“supported by voluntary contributions.” But the income arising\r\nfrom “ordinary sources” was rarely sufficient to enable Hospital\r\nmanagers to cope with the responsibilities thrown upon them without\r\nincurring constant deficits and sometimes financial disaster.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years ago some Birmingham men, amongst whom the late Rector\r\nof Birmingham (Dr. J. C. Miller) deserves most honourable mention,\r\ngrappled with the difficulty. The various Clergy and Ministers of\r\nReligion, assisted by prominent lay townsmen, determined to organise a\r\ngeneral Collection once a year in all the Churches and Chapels of the\r\ntown and neighbourhood, for the benefit of the local Medical Charities.\r\nThus originated “Hospital Sunday.” It was resolved that every third\r\nyear the whole collection should go to the General Hospital, every\r\nthird year to the Queen’s Hospital, and every third year that it should\r\nbe divided among the smaller Medical Charities in certain proportions\r\nbased upon the number of patients relieved.\r\n\r\n“Hospital Sunday” became immensely popular, and the example set by\r\nBirmingham was imitated by the metropolis and by the larger towns and\r\ncities of England. Since its establishment up to last year the medical\r\ncharities of Birmingham have received from the Hospital Sunday Fund the\r\nenormous subsidy of £124,430.\r\n\r\nFrom this source the Queen’s Hospital has received, up to the year\r\n1884, £42,188; its triennial collection amounted to £4,356 in 1881,\r\nand to £4,181 in 1884. But the year 1873 witnessed a new departure.\r\nIt was felt that it was not enough to make collections only from the\r\nhabitual frequenters of churches and chapels, most of whom might be\r\nassumed to be regular subscribers to the various charities or donors\r\nto their funds. It was felt too that the great body of the artisan\r\npopulation were able and willing to do something for the support of the\r\ngreat institutions founded almost wholly for their benefit; and thus\r\n“Hospital Saturday” became a friendly but formidable rival to “Hospital\r\nSunday.” Once a year collections are made in all the manufactories and\r\nlarge workshops in the town and district, and up to, and including the\r\nyear 1885, the hospitals have been subsidised from this welcome source\r\nto the extent of £46,800. Not only so, but these annual collections\r\nare steadily growing in amount, to the great credit of the industrial\r\npopulation and to the lasting benefit of the charities of the town.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the increasing annual amount the Queen’s\r\nHospital has thus received. In the year 1880 it was £670; in 1881,\r\n£711; in 1882, £852; in 1883, £931; in 1884, £1,056; in 1885, £1,135,\r\nand the accounts for the present year shew a large increase on any\r\nfigures hitherto recorded.\r\n\r\n=The Birmingham General Dispensary.=--This Institution is the oldest\r\nmedical charity in Birmingham except the General Hospital. It was\r\nfounded in 1794, and has deservedly enjoyed a very large share of\r\npublic confidence. It is a strictly privileged institution. Every\r\nsubscriber has so many tickets for his subscription, and has also the\r\npower of procuring supernumerary tickets. There are of course no beds,\r\nall patients being attended at their own homes. Accidents or urgent\r\ncases, such as sometimes put great pressure upon the resources of a\r\ngeneral hospital, are here extremely rare. There is, therefore, no\r\ndebt. The services of the medical staff can be purchased at a rate\r\nsufficient to cover the cost. Consequently the subscription list has\r\nalways been large, the finances invariably prosperous, the revenue\r\nalways in excess of the expenditure. So great has been the success of\r\nthis institution, that the managers sometimes hardly know what to do\r\nwith their money.\r\n\r\nThe income for the year 1885 from all sources was considerably in\r\nexcess of £6,000. The whole expenditure was under £5,000, and the\r\nmanagers were able out of the income of the year to put by £1,500. The\r\nincome from investments alone was £608. There was a considerable sum\r\non deposit, and a large credit balance at the Bank. There is a central\r\ndispensary in Union Street, and branches at Camp Hill, Aston, and\r\nLadywood, all with Resident Surgeons attached.\r\n\r\nIn former days it had a large midwifery and vaccination department,\r\nbut the former was abandoned in 1869 and the latter in 1870. The\r\ndispensary, therefore, now addresses itself only to the ordinary\r\nmedical treatment of the sick poor. All the medical officers, including\r\nthe consulting officers, are paid for their services. The patients who,\r\nin 1871, numbered 10,570, had increased in 1885 to 21,888.\r\n\r\n=The Orthopædic and Spinal Hospital.=--This small but useful\r\ninstitution has existed since the year 1817. It has three\r\nActing-Surgeons, and one Assistant Surgeon. The Surgeons attend daily\r\nand give gratuitous advice to the deformed poor. Ordinary cases are\r\nadmitted without letters of recommendation, but in the numerous cases\r\nwhere supports or instruments are required, subscribers’ tickets are\r\nnecessary to cover the cost. The instruments supplied in 1885 cost\r\nupwards of £500. The new cases in that year were 1,654, the attendances\r\n7,439. The total expenditure was about £1,400.\r\n\r\n=The Eye Hospital.=--The Birmingham and Midland Eye Hospital is one\r\nof the best special Hospitals in the provinces. It has not only been\r\nof incalculable service to the poor of the town and neighbourhood,\r\nbut it has founded an important school of ophthalmic science in the\r\nMidland district. Diseases of the eye cannot be adequately dealt\r\nwith at general hospitals. Where the delicacies and difficulties\r\nof any disorder are such as to require minute manipulative skill\r\nand practitioners of great experience, a special Institution is\r\nimperatively necessary. This Hospital has had a really splendid career.\r\nIt was founded in 1824, and commenced its operations in a humble\r\nmanner in Cannon Street. It then migrated into improved premises in\r\nSteelhouse Lane. In 1861 it found a third home in Temple Row, and in\r\n1884 a new Hospital was erected and opened in Church Street capable of\r\naccommodating 70 beds.\r\n\r\nThe acting Medical Officers of the Institution (exclusive of House or\r\nResident Surgeons) are by the laws to consist of not less than four and\r\nnot more than six Honorary Surgeons, so that ample provision is made to\r\nsecure the adequate surgical treatment of the present patients and of\r\nany probable increase in their number.\r\n\r\nIn order to insure the maximum of surgical ability every acting Surgeon\r\nis bound to resign his appointment on his attaining the age of 55\r\nyears, or on becoming physically unable to discharge his duties in an\r\nefficient manner.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1885 there were 925 in-patients and 13,461 out-patients.\r\n590 operations were performed during the year on in-patients alone.\r\n\r\nThe annual income is large, but as yet hardly adequate to meet the\r\nrequirements of the new Hospital. The income for 1884 was £3,807, and\r\nthe expenditure £3,213; but the income for 1885 was only £3,098, whilst\r\nthe expenditure was £4,187.\r\n\r\n=The Lying-in Charity.=--This is a small but most useful and deserving\r\nInstitution. It was founded as a Lying-in Hospital in the year 1842.\r\nIts original managers attempted to deal not only with lying-in cases\r\nin the wards of the Hospital, but also with the ordinary diseases of\r\nwomen, and with children. The Institution was never successful, chiefly\r\nbecause it attempted too much. As a rule no Institution devoted to more\r\nthan one speciality succeeds. Moreover, when the statistics of Lying-in\r\nHospitals came to be examined, it was discovered that there was a\r\ngreat difference in the mortality of patients treated in Hospitals and\r\nof patients treated at their own homes. In the year 1874, the system\r\nof the charity was remodelled, a large building was abandoned, and\r\npatients were attended only at home. The change has proved eminently\r\nsuccessful. Four competent Midwives are regularly employed, all of\r\nwhom have large experience. The medical staff consists of a consulting\r\nSurgeon and four acting Surgeons who are called in in cases of\r\ndifficulty or danger. The competence of the Midwives is best tested by\r\nthe fact that the services of the members of the honorary medical staff\r\nare only required on an average once in 44 cases.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1885, 931 cases were attended at a cost of less than £500.\r\nFew institutions in Birmingham have in recent years done better work at\r\na more reasonable cost than the Lying-in Charity.\r\n\r\n=Free Hospital for Sick Children.=--This Hospital has been one of the\r\nmost successful ever founded in Birmingham. It is a general Hospital so\r\nfar as regards disease, but a special Hospital so far as regards age.\r\n\r\nIt was founded in 1861, and was opened for the reception of patients on\r\nthe 1st January, 1862, and during that year its income and expenditure\r\nwere about £700. In the year 1885, its in-patients were 713. Home\r\npatients, 27. Out-patients, 12,692. Its income and expenditure exceeded\r\n£4,000.\r\n\r\nFew local institutions have ever enjoyed greater popularity. The\r\nCharity from its very name appeals to a very wide circle, and the\r\nadministration has been marked by foresight and discretion. Not only\r\nwas it the first Free Hospital in the town, but it was established on\r\nprinciples then considered novel, but which have since in part at least\r\nbeen adopted by other local institutions.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the tenure of office of physicians and surgeons is\r\nlimited, and the medical officers, though absolute in their own\r\ndepartment, cannot sit upon the Board of Management.\r\n\r\nAgain, at this Hospital, first in Birmingham, was an honest effort made\r\nto limit the relief given to the _Hospital population_ only, that is to\r\nthose who were above pauperism, but below the capability of paying for\r\nmedical advice. Here too, the system was first adopted of paying the\r\nJunior members of the Medical Staff, and here also was the principle\r\nfirst laid down of vesting the election of medical officers of the\r\ncharity in a large and representative Committee. This rule has been\r\nalmost unanimously followed by other local institutions.\r\n\r\nThe Hospital has a dispensary and out-patient department in the\r\ncentre of the town, an in-patient department with detached fever\r\nwards in Broad Street, and a convalescent department with separate\r\nmanagement, many miles from the town. 151 children were received in the\r\nconvalescent home during the year 1885.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Committee of Management of this Hospital is\r\nsupplemented by the kindly aid of a large Committee of Lady Visitors,\r\nand by a Special Committee of Ladies for the management of the\r\nConvalescent Home.\r\n\r\n=The Ear and Throat Hospital.=--This is a small institution, having\r\nfor its object the treatment of diseases of the ear and throat. It has\r\nlately been reconstructed upon a new basis. It is rather a dispensary\r\nthan a hospital, having no in-patient department. Tickets can be\r\nobtained by patients desiring the advice of the Medical officers. The\r\nsubscription list is under £100 a year, the income being made up by\r\ncontributions from the Hospital Sunday and Hospital Saturday Funds,\r\ntogether with the amount realised by the sale of supplementary tickets.\r\nThe total number of cases treated during the year 1885, was 2,398.\r\n\r\n=The Dental Hospital.=--This institution was founded in 1860, and\r\nshould rather have been termed the Dental Dispensary than the Dental\r\nHospital. It has five honorary dental surgeons and four honorary\r\nadministrators of anæsthetics. Thus the advantages and resources of\r\nmodern dentistry are placed within the reach of those who but for\r\nthis institution would undergo much preventable pain. Every fitting\r\napplicant suffering pain is entitled to advice and attention, but\r\nspecial operations are performed only upon patients who have a\r\nrecommendation from a Governor.\r\n\r\nThere were 9,453 patients in 1885. The expenditure was less than £300.\r\n\r\n=The Sanatorium.=--This Institution was founded in 1866, and has proved\r\na most valuable supplement to the work of our local hospitals. It\r\nenables convalescent patients to obtain rest, pure air and nutritious\r\ndiet at one of the most healthy and beautiful spots within a reasonable\r\ndistance of Birmingham.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a fund had been raised for relief of distress in the\r\ncotton districts, and when the distress had subsided a considerable\r\nportion of the fund remained undisposed of. With the consent of the\r\ndonors £4,500 was devoted to forming a nucleus for the Building Fund of\r\nthe Sanatorium. The work was completed in 1873. The total cost of the\r\nsite, buildings, and furniture was £16,800.\r\n\r\nThe institution receives 40 male, and 40 female patients, and every\r\npossible effort is made to provide for their health and their amusement.\r\n\r\nNo privileges are given to subscribers; but patients are received\r\neither from the Medical Charities in Birmingham, or from the general\r\npublic, on the recommendation of a medical practitioner.\r\n\r\nThe income and expenditure are about £2,000 a year. The charity applies\r\nall donations exceeding £10 to a deposit or investment fund, and ten\r\nper cent. of the amount of the fund so created is withdrawn each year\r\nfor the current purposes of the institution.\r\n\r\n=The Homœopathic Hospital and Dispensary.=--This hospital is supported\r\nby the friends of the system of homœopathy. It has one honorary\r\nphysician and five honorary surgeons. It is a general hospital, and\r\nhas departments for in-patients, out-patients, and home patients. The\r\nin-patient system is different from that of most general hospitals, a\r\ncertain number of beds being reserved for patients who can afford to\r\npay for the benefits they receive. Again, all in-patients are admitted\r\nat the discretion of the medical staff, so that as regards this\r\ndepartment the hospital is free, no subscriber having the privilege of\r\nensuring a bed. Subscribers have tickets for out-patients and for home\r\nvisits. This provision for visiting patients at their own homes is of\r\ngreat value in connection with this Charity. The in-patients in 1885\r\nwere 167. The home-patients 584. The out-patients 18,752.\r\n\r\nThe expenditure for 1885 was £1,640. The income £1,380, leaving a\r\ndeficit of £260.\r\n\r\nLadies as well as gentlemen serve on the Committee of Management.\r\n\r\n=The Hospital for Women.=--This is a valuable and important\r\nInstitution. When the Lying-in Hospital gave up the treatment of\r\nwomen’s special diseases and devoted itself exclusively to midwifery,\r\nthere was an opening for an institution for the reception and treatment\r\nof women afflicted with diseases peculiar to their sex.\r\n\r\nTwo classes of patients are admitted. Paying patients who contribute\r\nthe whole or part of the cost of treatment, and general cases, which\r\nare admitted without any subscriber’s ticket of recommendation. The\r\nexpenditure for the year 1884 (no report has been issued for 1885) was\r\n£1,736. The income was £1,466, leaving a deficit of £270.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year the out-patients were 3,299, and the in-patients\r\n294.\r\n\r\nThe acting Medical staff consists of five Surgeons, one of whom is a\r\nlady. It will be obvious that in a Hospital of this character many\r\noperations of cardinal importance are constantly performed. No fewer\r\nthan 217 operations were performed during the year 1884.\r\n\r\n=The Skin and Lock Hospital.=--This Institution was opened in 1881 for\r\nthe treatment of skin and lock diseases. There was ample room for it,\r\nno special department for cases of this kind existing in any of the\r\ngeneral Hospitals of the town.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1885 nearly 2,000 cases were treated. The income of\r\nthe year amounted to £1,081, and the expenditure only to £624. The\r\nCommittee of Management, however, are desirous of erecting a Hospital,\r\nand thus be enabled to deal with serious cases as in-patients. A\r\nsite has been secured for this purpose in John Bright Street. It is\r\nestimated that £5,000 will be required. £1,200 of which has already\r\nbeen obtained.\r\n\r\nThe Hospital is conducted on the free system, but some patients are\r\nreceived on payment of a sum sufficient to cover the bare cost of their\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n=The Deaf and Dumb Institution.=--This Charity is an educational\r\nestablishment. It was founded nearly three quarters of a century ago\r\nfor the instruction of deaf and dumb children. 70 boys and 58 girls\r\nwere on the books during the year 1885. The Charity is supported by\r\nvoluntary contributions, supplemented to a considerable extent by\r\npayments on behalf of the inmates.\r\n\r\nChildren are admitted by election, and the election takes place at\r\nthe Annual General Meeting. Every Governor is entitled to one vote\r\nin respect of a donation of £10, or an annual subscription of £1.\r\n1s. Children admitted without election pay £25 per annum. Elected\r\nchildren pay £10 if they come from Warwickshire, Worcestershire,\r\nor Staffordshire; £15 if they come from other Counties, and £20\r\nif maintained by Boards of Guardians. The system of education is\r\nexcellent. Children are taught not only by means of the manual alphabet\r\nbut by articulation and lip reading, in cases where that system can be\r\nadvantageously employed.\r\n\r\nThe Institution is placed in a healthy and beautiful situation in\r\nChurch Road, Edgbaston.\r\n\r\nThe income for the year 1885 was £2,726, made up as\r\nfollows:--Subscriptions £461, Legacies £804, Donations £63, Interest on\r\nInvestments £400, Payments for Pupils £986, Sundries £12. Total £2,726.\r\n\r\nThe expenditure was about £100 in excess of the income. There is no\r\nrule as to funding legacies. The charity does excellent work and is\r\ndeservedly popular.\r\n\r\n=The General Institution for the Blind.=--This Institution has been\r\nof immense benefit to the town and neighbourhood. The buildings\r\nare handsome and commodious, and are situated in a charming part\r\nof Edgbaston, about two miles from the centre of Birmingham. The\r\nCharity was founded thirty-eight years ago. The expenditure in 1885\r\nwas a little in excess of £4,200, whilst the income, including sales\r\nof materials manufactured by the inmates, reached the large sum of\r\n£6,270. The subscriptions and donations amounted to £778, Legacies\r\n£2,119, the interest on investments was £734. Payments by Pupils £765,\r\nSales £1,874. Here too the legacies are not funded. But the large sum\r\nreceived from legacies in 1885, together with the balance in hand at\r\nthe commencement of that year, enabled the managers to invest over\r\n£2,000 out of the year’s income.\r\n\r\n46 males and 32 females were in the Institution in 1885, and 257 adult\r\nblind persons were visited and taught at their own homes.\r\n\r\nGreat efforts are made by the managers to find permanent employment\r\nfor pupils who have been taught at this excellent charity. Many pupils\r\nare turned out fully competent organists, and many become professional\r\npiano tuners, and follow the trade of basket making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nECCLESIASTICAL.\r\n\r\nBY G. J. JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe municipal borough of Birmingham comprises the whole of the parishes\r\nof Birmingham and Edgbaston, and part of the adjoining parish of Aston.\r\n\r\nAll these parishes were formerly in the Archdeaconry of Coventry, as\r\npart of the diocese of Lichfield and Coventry, and are now in the\r\nsame Archdeaconry as part of the diocese of Worcester. By an Order\r\nin Council, dated 22nd December, 1836, made in pursuance of the 6\r\n& 7 Will. IV., c. 77, the Archdeaconry of Coventry was taken away\r\nfrom the diocese of Lichfield and Coventry, and annexed to that of\r\nWorcester, and the former diocese became the diocese of Lichfield\r\nonly. The testamentary jurisdiction of the Bishop of Lichfield over\r\nthe archdeaconry, however, continued until the jurisdiction of all the\r\necclesiastical courts in such matters was abolished as from the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1858, by the 20 and 21 Vic., c. 77.\r\n\r\nThe original parish of Birmingham (otherwise called the parish of St.\r\nMartin, from the mother church of the parish dedicated to that Saint)\r\ncontains 2,660 acres only, whilst the acreage of the entire borough\r\nis 8,420 acres. The difference is made up of the entire parish of\r\nEdgbaston, 2,790 acres, and part of the parish of Aston, 2,970 acres.\r\n\r\nTaking the parishes separately, we commence with the\r\n\r\n\r\nPARISH OF BIRMINGHAM.[33]\r\n\r\n=St. Martin’s.=--We find that the earliest mention of the mother\r\nchurch of St. Martin in our national records is a licence of the 6th of\r\nMay, 1330 (4 Edward III.), to Walter de Clodeshale, of Saltley (then an\r\nadjoining hamlet), to grant lands for the endowment of a priest to say\r\nmass daily at the altar of the Virgin in St. Martin’s. Seventeen years\r\nafterwards (21 Edward III.), Richard, son of Walter de Clodeshale,\r\nobtained a licence for a further grant to endow a second priest to say\r\ndaily mass.\r\n\r\nIn 1392 (16 Richard II.), there is a record of a licence to found and\r\nendow a guild in honour of The Holy Cross, and another chantry in St.\r\nMartin’s for two chaplains. All these charities were suppressed at\r\nthe time of the dissolution of the monasteries. The endowments of the\r\nClodeshale charities were sold,[34] as was also a small part of the\r\nendowments of the Guild of the Holy Cross. The rest were re-granted by\r\nEdward VI. for the foundation and endowment of the Grammar School.\r\n\r\nFor three centuries after its foundation St. Martin’s Church must have\r\nbeen nearly at the top of the town, which consisted, as Leland saw it\r\neven in 1538, of one long street, namely, the present Digbeth and High\r\nStreet, and the old church sufficed for all its wants, especially as\r\nthe lower part of the town below Digbeth was served by the chapel of\r\nSt. John, noticed under Aston parish.[35]\r\n\r\nThe tower and spire, having become unsafe, were taken down and rebuilt\r\nin 1855, and in 1872 the rebuilding of the rest of the church was\r\ncommenced, and it was finished and re-consecrated on the 20th of July,\r\n1875. Attached to the church are mission rooms in Barwick Street and\r\nPark Street.\r\n\r\nThe original parish has been, by the successive agencies of special\r\nacts of parliament, the orders of the Church Building Commissioners\r\n(1818 to 1856), and afterwards of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, or\r\nby the Bishop in exercise of powers given by 1 and 2, W. IV., c. 38\r\n(now repealed), divided into five rectories and twenty-one vicarages\r\n(all incumbents of churches entitled to perform marriages, churchings,\r\nand baptisms, and receive the fees for their own use, being now termed\r\nvicars under the statute 31 and 32 Vic., c. 117). The successive\r\ndivisions are detailed in chronological order.\r\n\r\n=St. Philip’s.=--In the early part of the reign of Queen Anne,\r\nBirmingham had extended northwards and upwards from the mother church,\r\nand this necessitated the foundation of St. Philip’s Church and parish,\r\ncreated by special Act of Parliament (7 Anne, c. 131, A.D. 1708)\r\nentitled “An Act for building a parish church and parsonage house, and\r\nmaking a new church and new parish in Birmingham, to be called the\r\nparish of St. Philip.” The preamble recites that there was only one\r\nchurch in the parish of Birmingham, and that it was expedient to build\r\nanother in the “high town quarter.” It then carves out of the parish\r\nof St. Martin, the parish of St. Philip, and constitutes it a rectory.\r\nThe church was consecrated in 1715, and partly rebuilt and enlarged in\r\n1884. Its situation, between Colmore Row and Temple Row, is the finest\r\nin the town.\r\n\r\n=St. Bartholomew.=--The next ecclesiastical structure in order of\r\ntime, was St. Bartholomew’s, built in 1749 as a chapel of ease to St.\r\nMartin’s, to accommodate the then rapidly increasing population east\r\nof St. Martin’s. The land was the gift of Joseph Jennens, whose name\r\nis still commemorated in Jennens Row. In the year 1847, it was created\r\na district chapelry, and in 1869, a part of the district was assigned\r\nto the consolidated chapelry of St. Gabriel. The churchyard and the\r\nadjoining burial ground of St. Martin, containing four acres and a\r\nhalf (called the Park Street Burial Ground) were, in the year 1880,\r\nconverted by the Corporation into a public garden. There is a mission\r\nroom in Fox street, attached to the church.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1772, the first Church Extension Society was formed in\r\nBirmingham for the purpose of building “one or more churches,” which\r\nresulted in the passing of another Act of Parliament (12 Geo. III.,\r\nc. 64, A.D. 1772) “for building two new chapels, and providing burial\r\nplaces thereto.” The first built of these two chapels was--\r\n\r\n=St. Mary’s=, completed in 1774 on land granted by Mary Weaman, who\r\ngave her christian name to the church and her surname to the adjoining\r\nstreet. It was originally a chapel of ease to St. Martin’s, but\r\nwas created a district chapelry in 1841. The chapel was thoroughly\r\nrenovated in 1857, and in 1882 the disused burial ground was, at the\r\ncost of the Corporation, laid out as a garden for public use.\r\n\r\n=St. Paul’s.=--The other of the two churches built under the act\r\nof 1772 was St. Paul’s, in what was then the northernmost part of\r\nBirmingham. It was built in 1779, on land given by Charles Colmore out\r\nof a large estate he had there. It was created a district in the year\r\n1841.\r\n\r\n=Christ Church=, at the top of New Street, which enjoys the unenviable\r\ndistinction of being the ugliest church in the town, was authorised\r\nby a special act of parliament of the year 1803 “for erecting a new\r\nchurch to be called Christ Church, in the town of Birmingham.” All the\r\nsittings were to be free, and it therefore obtained the name of “the\r\nFree Church.” It was consecrated in 1813, but not finished until three\r\nyears later. In 1865 it was constituted a consolidated chapelry out of\r\nthe parishes of St. Martin and St. Philip. Attached to the church are\r\nmission rooms in Pinfold street and Fleet street.\r\n\r\nThis was the last of the churches for which a special Act of Parliament\r\nwas required, for in the year 1818, the Act 58, Geo. III. c. 45, was\r\npassed, establishing the Church Building Commission and granting a sum\r\nof one million (increased six years afterwards to a million and a half)\r\nfor building additional churches throughout the kingdom, and for the\r\ndivision of parishes.\r\n\r\n=St. George’s.=--The first result of this in Birmingham was St.\r\nGeorge’s Church near Tower Street, consecrated July 30th, 1822. At\r\nthat time the site was surrounded by green fields, and it was known\r\nas St. George’s in the Fields. In pursuance of the provisions of the\r\nAct of 1818, it was constituted a separate parish, taken out of St.\r\nMartin’s, and because St. Martin’s was a rectory, St. George’s became a\r\nrectory also. The Church itself was enlarged in 1882. There are mission\r\nrooms in New Summer Street and Smith Street, licensed for worship.\r\nThe district chapelries of St. Stephen and St. Matthias, have been\r\nconstituted out of the original parish of St. George.\r\n\r\n=St. Peter’s= in Dale End was consecrated August 10th, 1827, as a\r\nchapel of ease to St. Philip’s Church, in which parish it was. It\r\nwas destroyed by fire in 1831, and rebuilt in 1837. In 1847, it was\r\nconstituted a district chapelry.\r\n\r\n=St. Thomas’s= in Holloway Head was consecrated October 22nd, 1829,\r\nand like St. George’s, was constituted a new parish, carved out of St.\r\nMartin’s, and a rectory under the 58 Geo. III. c. 45. Parts of the\r\noriginal parish have been assigned to the districts of Immanuel and St.\r\nAsaph.\r\n\r\n=All Saints=, built near Lodge Road at Birmingham Heath, was originally\r\na small Church, consecrated September 28th, 1833, and greatly enlarged\r\nin 1881. It is a parish and rectory formed in the year 1834, out of St.\r\nMartin’s parish, and a portion of the parish has been since assigned\r\nto the district chapelry of St. Cuthbert. There are two mission halls,\r\none in Heaton Street, and the other at Nineveh Schoolroom, attached to\r\nAll Saints. This was the last of the rectories created under the Act of\r\n1818. All the districts subsequently created have been either assigned\r\nby the Bishop or formed under the Peel Acts, 1843 and 1844, or the New\r\nParishes (Marquis of Blandford’s) Act, 1856.\r\n\r\n=Bishop Ryder’s Church=, in Gem Street, was built in 1838, on land\r\ngranted by the Governors of King Edward’s Grammar School. It is so\r\ncalled after Dr. Ryder (b. 1777, d. 1836) who was successively Bishop\r\nof Gloucester (1815-1824), and afterwards of Lichfield and Coventry\r\n(1824-1836), and who greatly interested himself in church extension in\r\nthe poorer and more populous parts of his diocese. In the year 1840 a\r\nseparate district was assigned to it.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1838 a society was formed for building ten new churches in\r\nBirmingham; only five were built, and these were St. Matthew’s, St.\r\nMark’s, St. Luke’s, St. Stephen’s, and St. Andrew’s. Three of these,\r\nnamely, St. Mark’s, St. Luke’s, and St. Stephen’s were in the parish of\r\nBirmingham. The other two will be noticed under Aston parish.\r\n\r\n=St. Mark’s= is in King Edward’s Road, Summer Hill, and is built on\r\nland granted by the Governors of King Edward’s Grammar School. It was\r\nconsecrated in 1841, and in the same year constituted a district out of\r\nSt. Martin’s parish. There is a mission room in Steward Street.\r\n\r\n=St. Luke’s=, in the Bristol Road, almost on the border of the parish\r\nof Edgbaston. It was consecrated September 28th, 1842. In the year 1844\r\nit was constituted a district parish out of St. Martin’s.\r\n\r\n=St. Stephen’s=, Newtown Row, built on part of the estate of the\r\nGovernors of King Edward’s Grammar School, was consecrated July 23rd,\r\n1844, and then constituted a district chapelry out of the parish of St.\r\nGeorge. A portion of it has since been assigned to the district of St.\r\nNicolas. There is a mission room in Theodore Street.\r\n\r\n=St. Jude’s=, in Tonk Street, in the midst of one of the poorest\r\ndistricts of the town, was consecrated 26th July, 1851, and enlarged\r\nin 1879. In the year 1845, before the building of the church, it was\r\nconstituted a district out of the parishes of St. Martin and St. Philip.\r\n\r\n=St. John’s= (Ladywood), Monument Road, built on land granted by the\r\nGovernors of the Free Grammar School, was consecrated March 15th, 1854.\r\nBy an order in Council, gazetted June 20th, 1854, it was constituted a\r\ndistrict chapelry out of St. Martin’s parish, and has since (1876) had\r\nthe district chapelry of St. Margaret’s carved out of it. The church\r\nwas greatly enlarged in 1881.\r\n\r\n=St. Matthias’=, Wheeler Street, is the church of a new district\r\nchapelry formed in the year 1856 out of the parish of St. George, and\r\npart of that district has since been assigned to St. Saviour’s. The\r\nchurch was consecrated June 4th, 1856, and enlarged in 1879.\r\n\r\n=St. Barnabas’=, Ryland Street North. The parish was formed out of St.\r\nMartin’s in the year 1861, the church having been built and consecrated\r\nOctober 24th, 1860. At a very little distance is\r\n\r\n=Immanuel Church=, in Broad Street, which occupies the site of what was\r\nonce the chapel of the Magdalen Asylum. It was consecrated May 7th,\r\n1865, and is the church of a parish formed in that year out of St.\r\nThomas’s parish.\r\n\r\n=St. David’s=, Bissell Street, is the church of a district chapelry\r\nformed in the year 1866 out of St. Luke’s parish. The church was\r\nconsecrated in July, 1865.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1865, The Birmingham Church Extension Society was formed.\r\nIn 1867 Miss Ryland contributed a sum of £10,000 towards the same\r\nobjects and subsequently a second donation of £10,000. Out of these\r\ndonations the cost of the churches of St. Gabriel, St. Lawrence (see\r\nAston), and St. Nicolas was mainly defrayed.\r\n\r\n=St. Nicolas’=, in Lower Tower Street, consecrated July 12th, 1868,\r\nand, by order in Council, 18th June, 1869, constituted a district\r\nchapelry out of St. Stephen’s parish.\r\n\r\n=St. Asaph’s=, Great Colmore Street, of which the site was presented\r\nby Mr. Cregoe Colmore, was consecrated December 8th, 1868. By order in\r\nCouncil, 18th June, 1869, it was constituted a district chapelry out of\r\nthe parish of St. Thomas.\r\n\r\n=St. Gabriel’s=, in Pickford Street, Digbeth, was consecrated January\r\n5th, 1869, and by order in Council 7th August, 1869, was formed as\r\na consolidated chapelry out of the parishes of St. Martin and St.\r\nBartholomew.\r\n\r\n=St. Cuthbert’s=, St. Cuthbert’s Road, Birmingham Heath, was\r\nconsecrated March 19th, 1872, and is a vicarage constituted by order in\r\nCouncil 15th October, 1872, out of the parish of All Saints.\r\n\r\n=St. Saviour’s=, Bridge Street, Hockley, was consecrated May 1st, 1874,\r\nand in the same year constituted a district chapelry out of the new\r\nparish of St. Matthias.\r\n\r\n=St. Margaret’s=, Ledsam Street, Ladywood, consecrated October 2nd,\r\n1875, and by order in council 12th February, 1876, constituted a\r\ndistrict chapelry out of the parish of St. John, Ladywood.\r\n\r\n=Christ Church=, Gillott Road, Summerfield, built in memory of the\r\nforty-nine years’ ministry of the late Rev. George Lea, M.A., at Christ\r\nChurch, Birmingham, and St. George’s, Edgbaston. It was consecrated\r\nApril 30th, 1885; the same year it was created a district chapelry out\r\nof St. John’s, Ladywood.\r\n\r\nNow passing into the\r\n\r\n\r\nPARISH OF EDGBASTON.\r\n\r\n=St. Bartholomew.=--The parish church, dedicated to St. Bartholomew, is\r\nat the junction of Church Road and Priory Road, and close to Edgbaston\r\nPark and Hall. There is said to have been a church on the site in 775.\r\nThe present church now (1886) in course of enlargement was rebuilt in\r\n1810. The vicars of Edgbaston have been remarkable for longevity. The\r\nRev. John Pixell, who was inducted in 1760, was succeeded by his son\r\nthe Rev. Charles Pixell in 1794, and he held the living for 54 years.\r\nOn his death, in 1848, the late Rev. Isaac Spooner became vicar, and\r\nheld it until his death in 1884.\r\n\r\n=St. George’s.=--The rapid increase of population in this parish, the\r\nWest End of Birmingham, led to the building of St. George’s Church,\r\nat the end of Calthorpe Road, about half a mile nearer the town than\r\nthe old church, to which it was a chapel of ease. It was consecrated\r\nNovember 28th, 1838. It was greatly enlarged in 1885, and constituted a\r\nseparate district in 1852, by the Church Building Commissioners.\r\n\r\n=St. James’s= in St. James’s Road, was another chapel of ease,\r\nconsecrated 1st June, 1852. In the same year it had a separate district\r\nassigned to it by the Church Building Commissioners.\r\n\r\n=St. Augustine’s=, near the top of the Hagley Road, was built in the\r\nyear 1867, as another chapel of ease to Edgbaston Old Church, to serve\r\nthe increasing population of the northern portion of the parish. It was\r\nconsecrated September 12th, 1868, and cost £9,000. A tower and spire,\r\nadded in 1876, cost £4,000 more. It has not yet (1886) any district\r\nlegally assigned to it.\r\n\r\n=St. Ambrose=, a temporary church, in the Pershore Road, is another\r\nchapel of ease in the southern portion of the parish. It is the gift\r\nof Mrs. Spooner, as a memorial of her late husband, the Rev. Isaac\r\nSpooner, vicar of the parish 1848 to 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARISH OF ASTON.\r\n\r\nWe have to deal only with the portion of this parish which is included\r\nin the Borough, and commence with the chapel of\r\n\r\n=St. John’s=, Deritend, which is the second most ancient church in\r\nthe town. It is situate just over the Aston side of the stream which\r\ndivides that parish from Birmingham, and was founded in 1375 by some\r\ninhabitants of the hamlets of Deritend and Bordesley, because of\r\nthe inconvenience of resorting to the parish church of Aston, three\r\nmiles away. The then Lord of the Manor of Birmingham gave the land,\r\nand the inhabitants built the chapel, and by an agreement, still\r\nextant, dated 29th May, 1381, and made between the Prior and monks of\r\nTykeford, patrons of the parish church of Aston, the vicar of Aston,\r\nthe Lord of the Manor of Birmingham, and thirteen of the inhabitants of\r\nDeritend and Bordesley, with the consent of the Bishop of the diocese,\r\nthen called Coventry and Lichfield, the inhabitants of Deritend and\r\nBordesley were empowered to appoint, “at their own charges,” a chaplain\r\nto celebrate divine service in a certain chapel in honor of St. John\r\nthe Baptist there lately built.[36] The chaplain is still elected by\r\nthe vote of the inhabitants of Deritend and Bordesley, and down to the\r\nyear 1842 the proceedings did not differ from those of a contested\r\npolitical election. The last election took place June 15th, 1870, when\r\nthe present chaplain, the Rev. W. C. Badger, M.A., was elected by a\r\nmajority of 1561 votes over his opponent. The present chapel dates from\r\n1735. There is a mission room in Darwin Street. Part of the district\r\nconventionally assigned to it was, by order dated 29th December, 1885,\r\nlegally created a “Peel district” without a church, by the name of =St.\r\nBasil’s=.\r\n\r\nThis chapel of St. John remained from the fourteenth to the eighteenth\r\ncentury the only chapel of ease to the parish church of Aston for the\r\nincreasing population of that part of the town which gradually extended\r\nitself into Aston parish. In the early part of this century a genteel\r\nsuburb had formed itself at the east end of the town, on the Coleshill\r\nroad, of which the eastern portions of Great Brook Street and Ashted\r\nRow are still evidences.\r\n\r\nDr. Ash, a celebrated physician of Birmingham, and founder of the\r\nGeneral Hospital, built what Hutton calls a “sumptuous house” there.\r\nWhen he left it to live in London it was altered into a proprietary\r\nchapel by a Mr. Brooke, an attorney, who gave his name to the street.\r\nThe chapel was opened on the 9th of October, 1791, but was sold in 1798\r\nand afterwards became--\r\n\r\n=St. James’s Chapel=, Ashted, consecrated August 7th, 1807. From its\r\nclose proximity to the cavalry barracks, it was called “The Barrack’s\r\nChapel.” A separate parish was allotted to it out of the Aston parish,\r\nin the year 1853. There is a mission room in Vauxhall Road.\r\n\r\n=Holy Trinity Chapel=, at the top of Bradford Street, was the result\r\nof a meeting for church extension, held in October, 1818. It was\r\nconsecrated 23rd January, 1823, and a district carved out of Aston\r\nparish was allotted to it in the year 1864. Parts of that district have\r\nsince been assigned to St. Alban and All Saints’, Smallheath. There is\r\na mission hall in Sandy Lane.\r\n\r\n=St. Matthew’s=, Great Lister Street, was consecrated 20th October,\r\n1840, and made the church of a district, 1842. The town has since\r\nextended for a mile eastward, and districts out of St. Matthew’s\r\ndistrict have been carved out and assigned to the district chapelries\r\nof St. Clement, St. Lawrence, and St. Anne, Duddeston, (_q.v._) There\r\nis a mission room in Lupin Street.\r\n\r\n=St. Andrew’s=, in St. Andrew’s Road, near the Coventry Road, was\r\nconsecrated September 30th, 1846, having been constituted a district\r\nchapelry out of the parish of Aston. Attached is an iron church,\r\ndedicated to =St. Oswald=, opposite Smallheath Park.\r\n\r\n=St. Clement’s=, in Nechells Park Road, was consecrated August 30th,\r\n1859, and a district out of St. Matthew’s, Duddeston, assigned to it in\r\n1860. It has a mission room in High Park Street, and a mission hall in\r\nCuckoo Road.\r\n\r\n=Christ Church=, near the Stratford Road, Sparkbrook, built on land\r\ngiven by Mr. S. S. Lloyd, was consecrated October 1, 1867, and a\r\nparticular district assigned to it 21st November, 1867. There is a\r\nmission hall in Dolobran Road.\r\n\r\n=St. Lawrence’s=, in Dartmouth Street, was consecrated June 25th, 1868,\r\nand by order in Council, 14th September, in the same year, constituted\r\na district chapelry out of the parish of St. Matthew.\r\n\r\n=St. Anne’s=, in Cato Street, Nechells, built partly out of funds\r\nprovided by the Church Extension Society, was consecrated 22nd October,\r\n1869, and by order in Council of December 7th, was constituted a\r\ndistrict chapelry out of the district of St. Matthew.

On\r\nthe first Declaration of Indulgence put forth by Charles the Second\r\nin 1672, rooms were licensed for public worship, and in 1687 eleven\r\ndissenters bought a plot of land in what was then called Philip Street,\r\nand built a meeting house, finished in 1689, the year of the passing\r\nof The Toleration Act. As the total cost of land and building was only\r\n£220, it could not have accommodated many hearers, and we find that\r\nanother meeting house, called the “Lower Meeting House,” was built\r\nin Deritend in a yard which was until lately called “Meeting House\r\nYard,” now taken into the continuation of Milk Street into Deritend.\r\nThis second chapel was injured in the Sacheverell Riots in 1715, and\r\nafterwards the congregation removed, in 1732, to what was formerly the\r\n“New Meeting,” in Moor Street, where they remained until the last day\r\nof the year 1861.\r\n\r\nThe worshippers at both these two original meeting houses called\r\nthemselves, and were called “Presbyterians,” used as the antithesis\r\nto “Episcopalian,” although they were really “Independent” in their\r\nform of church government. In theology both congregations were at\r\nfirst Calvinistic, but Mr. Howell, the sixth in succession of the\r\nministers of the Old Meeting, having become an avowed Arian, the more\r\northodox minority withdrew in the year 1747, and founded the church in\r\nCarr’s Lane--(see “Congregationalists.”) It is creditable to the good\r\nfeeling of the separatists that none of them sold their shares in the\r\n“Old Meeting” and one of them was re-appointed a trustee thirty years\r\nafterwards. From Arianism the congregations of both the Old and New\r\nMeetings gradually became Unitarian and are henceforth treated under\r\nthat title.\r\n\r\n=Unitarians.=--The Old Meeting House, built in 1689, was burned in the\r\nriots of 1791, and afterwards rebuilt. It had attached a burial ground\r\nwhich was used by both the congregations of the Old and New Meetings,\r\nand in which were interred the remains of many of the foremost men in\r\nthe public life of Birmingham for two centuries.[38] As before stated\r\nthe meeting house and ground were sold to the London and North Western\r\nRailway Company in 1882, and the remains of the dead were transferred\r\nto a separate piece of ground in the Borough Cemetery at Witton, and\r\nthe Congregation have built a new\r\n\r\nOLD MEETING CHURCH, in the Bristol Road, which was opened in 1885.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW MEETING HOUSE, of which Dr. Priestley was the minister from\r\n1780 to 1791, was destroyed in the riots of 1791 and rebuilt on its\r\noriginal site in Moor Street. The situation having become inconvenient\r\nit was (1861) sold to the Roman Catholics and became St. Michael’s,\r\nMoor Street (_q.v._), and the New Meeting congregation removed to\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH OF THE MESSIAH, Broad Street, opened 1st January, 1862. The\r\nRev. H. W. Crosskey, LL.D., is the minister.\r\n\r\nNEWHALL HILL CHAPEL was next in order of time to the Old and New\r\nMeetings, and was built in 1840 by members of both congregations, who\r\nhad previously a house for worship and Sunday schools in Cambridge\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nHURST STREET CHAPEL was built in the year 1844 as a mission chapel and\r\nhas been since enlarged. Another mission more immediately connected\r\nwith the New Meeting is\r\n\r\nLAWRENCE STREET CHAPEL, which was originally built as a place of\r\nworship for the Baptists then occupied by the disciples of Zion Ward,\r\nand afterwards used by the followers of Robert Owen, who were at one\r\ntime numerous in Birmingham.\r\n\r\nTHE BIRMINGHAM FREE CHRISTIAN SOCIETY have a chapel in Fazeley Street,\r\nserved by Lay preachers.\r\n\r\n=Baptists.=--It is somewhat singular that two of the oldest chapels\r\nbelonging to this body, namely, Cannon Street and Freeman Street,\r\nhave now ceased to exist. Cannon Street Chapel was built in 1737 on a\r\npart of what was then a cherry orchard (which gave its name to Cherry\r\nStreet). The original building was greatly enlarged in 1806. In those\r\ndays the well-to-do tradesmen of Birmingham lived in the town, and\r\nthe town chapels consequently drew their occupants from the immediate\r\nneighbourhood. Gradually, however, the old members died, and their sons\r\nand daughters went to live in the suburbs, and so Cannon Street, which\r\nwas the flourishing mother church of the Particular Baptists, dwindled\r\nin numbers. Fortunately the site of it was required by the Corporation\r\nof Birmingham, and it was sold for £26,500, and is now occupied by the\r\nCentral Arcade in Corporation Street. The purchase money was, under a\r\nscheme sanctioned by the Court of Chancery, expended in aid of several\r\nBaptist chapels in the town and suburbs.\r\n\r\nThe Chapel in Freeman Street is said to have been older than Cannon\r\nStreet to which place the worshippers at Freeman Street joined\r\nthemselves in 1752, and the edifice itself was taken down in 1856.\r\nThe next Chapel in order of date was built in Bond Street (near\r\nConstitution Hill) was opened in the year 1786, and was for many years\r\na flourishing church, but gradually decayed in numbers and influence,\r\nand is now occupied by the United Methodists (_q.v._).\r\n\r\nThe chief existing places of worship now belonging to the Baptists are\r\n\r\nNEWHALL STREET CHAPEL, originally built in 1791 by the followers of\r\nEmanuel Swedenborg.\r\n\r\nGRAHAM STREET or MOUNT ZION CHAPEL, opened in 1824 by the celebrated\r\nEdward Irving. Twenty years afterwards the pulpit was occupied for some\r\ntime by the late George Dawson, and subsequently, from 1851 to 1874, by\r\nthe Rev. Charles Vince, whose death was felt as a public calamity.\r\n\r\nHENEAGE STREET CHAPEL, of which the foundation stone was laid 1st\r\nof August, 1838, to commemorate the emancipation of the West Indian\r\nnegroes.\r\n\r\nCIRCUS CHAPEL, Bradford Street, opened 1848, so called because it was\r\nformerly a circus.\r\n\r\nWYCLIFFE CHURCH, in the Bristol Road, opened in 1861.\r\n\r\nCHURCH OF THE REDEEMER, Hagley Road, built by a portion of the\r\ncongregation of Graham Street, aided by a contribution of the Cannon\r\nStreet trustees, and opened in 1882.\r\n\r\nThere are also chapels in Guildford Street, Hope Street, Lodge Road\r\n(Hockley), Great King Street, Stratford Road, Spring Hill, Victoria\r\nStreet (Small Heath), Warwick Street (Deritend), and Wynn Street (Great\r\nColmore Street).\r\n\r\nThere is also a chapel belonging to the Particular Baptists of\r\nCalvinistic views in Frederick Street (Newhall Hill), built in 1850\r\nwith the proceeds of an old chapel in Bartholomew Street, which was\r\ncalled the “Cave of Adullam,” and removed by the extension of the\r\nrailway into New Street.\r\n\r\nThe General or Arminian Baptists had the chapel in Freeman Street (now\r\nremoved), and in September, 1786, opened the existing chapel in LOMBARD\r\nSTREET.\r\n\r\n=Congregationalists.=--CARR’S LANE.--This Church was formed, as before\r\nstated, in 1747, by members of the first Nonconformist Meeting house,\r\nthe “Old Meeting,” who did not agree with the Arianism of the then\r\nminister, Mr. Howell. The first building was opened in 1748, and was\r\nthen, as was the custom with meeting houses, built in a yard to screen\r\nit from observation. It has been several times enlarged and rebuilt.\r\nThe names of the Rev. John Angell James, who was minister here from\r\n1806 to his death, 1st October, 1859, and of his successor R. W. Dale,\r\nLL.D., the present minister, are known throughout the christian world.\r\n\r\nEBENEZER CHAPEL, in Steelhouse Lane, was built in 1818 by the admirers\r\nof a minister celebrated in his day, the Rev. Jehoiada Brewer, who\r\nlaid the foundation stone in 1816, but died before the building was\r\nfinished.[39] From endowments furnished by three members of this\r\ncongregation, Mr. Mansfield and his two sisters, Miss Mansfield and\r\nMrs. Glover, a college for the education of ministers was established\r\nat Spring Hill, Dudley Road, then removed to Moseley, and is now\r\nintended to be reconstituted at Oxford as “Mansfield College.”\r\n\r\nHIGHBURY CHAPEL, Graham Street, originally formed by the remnant of the\r\nLivery Street congregation, was opened in 1845.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS ROAD (Edgbaston) CHAPEL was built to commemorate the fiftieth\r\nyear of the pastorate of Carr’s Lane Chapel, by the late Rev. J. A.\r\nJames. He laid the foundation stone 11th September, 1855.\r\n\r\nThe Congregationalists have also chapels in Gooch Street, Moseley\r\nRoad, St. Andrew’s Road, Saltley, Small Heath, Parade (Tabernacle),\r\nand Winson Green Road, and several others outside the Borough, but in\r\nimmediate proximity to it..\r\n\r\n=Society of Friends.=--George Fox records in his journal that he held\r\na meeting in Birmingham in the year 1655, and there is good reason to\r\nbelieve in the existence of a small society from that date, meeting in\r\nprivate houses until 1703, when a plain brick meeting house fronting\r\nBull Street was built. There may have been an earlier meeting house in\r\nMonmouth Street, where there was a burial ground, acquired in 1851 by\r\nthe Great Western Railway, and now the site of the Arcade. The meeting\r\nhouse in Bull Street was several times enlarged, and in 1856 it was\r\npulled down, shops built fronting the street, and a more commodious\r\nmeeting house built in the rear. There is also another meeting place in\r\nBath Row. Meetings for religious worship and instruction, conducted by\r\nmembers of the Society, are held on Sundays at Severn Street Schools,\r\nand the Board Schools in Moseley Street and Bristol Street. The Early\r\nFirst-Day Morning School, and the other schools and classes at Severn\r\nStreet, established by the Friends, have done, and are doing an\r\nincalculable amount of good.\r\n\r\n=Wesleyan Methodists.=--John Wesley preached his first sermon in\r\nBirmingham in 1743, but it was not until 1764 that his followers\r\nacquired an old play house in Moor Street as their first chapel which\r\nhe opened. In 1782 they had so prospered as to build a chapel in Cherry\r\nStreet, which was opened by John Wesley himself, then in his eightieth\r\nyear. This chapel, enlarged in the year 1823, is now (July, 1886) to be\r\npulled down, and a new chapel built in Corporation Street.\r\n\r\nThe rapid increase of numbers necessitated additional chapels in\r\nBradford Street (1786), BELMONT ROW (1789), MARTIN STREET, (Broad\r\nStreet) (1834), NEWTOWN ROW CHAPEL (1837), WESLEY CHAPEL, Constitution\r\nHill (1838), besides a chapel in Bell Barn Road for which the present\r\nBRISTOL ROAD CHAPEL (1854) was substituted.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of connexional organization the Birmingham district is\r\ndivided into seven circuits, which include not only the chapels already\r\nmentioned but also thirty-three others within the Borough and its\r\nsuburbs, including Smethwick.\r\n\r\nMETHODIST NEW CONNEXION.--This section of the Methodist Community,\r\nwhich separated from the Wesleyans in 1797, only on questions of the\r\nshare of the laity in church government, first built a chapel in\r\nOxford Street (1811) now disused, then another in the northern part of\r\nthe town, Unett Street (1838), and have since built smaller ones in\r\nMoseley Street, Priestley Road (Stratford Road) Ladywood, Heath Street\r\nand Crabtree Road (Brookfields) in the Borough. These and a chapel\r\nat Smethwick are divided into two circuits supplied by three circuit\r\nministers.\r\n\r\nTHE PRIMITIVE METHODISTS.--This body has thirteen chapels in and near\r\nto the Borough, divided into three circuits, and served by four regular\r\nministers. The largest of these is in Gooch Street, and the others in\r\nthe Borough are in Sparkbrook, King Street, Lord Street, Nechells,\r\nGarrison Lane, Whitmore Street (Hockley) and Ladywood.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED METHODIST FREE CHURCHES have two circuits and two circuit\r\nministers and chapels in Rocky Lane (Nechells) Bond Street, (recently\r\nacquired from the Baptists, _q.v._) and Muntz Street (Birmingham Heath)\r\nbesides one at Washwood Heath.\r\n\r\nTHE WESLEYAN REFORMERS.--Have one regular minister and two chapels in\r\nUpper Trinity Street and Floodgate Street.\r\n\r\n=The English Presbyterian Church.=--These are the orthodox\r\nPresbyterians, as distinguished from the churches which, like the Old\r\nMeeting congregation, became Arian or Unitarian. They first occupied\r\nwhat is now the Baptist Chapel at Mount Zion, which was opened by the\r\ncelebrated Edward Irving (see Baptists), and then a chapel in Newhall\r\nStreet, afterwards the church in BROAD STREET, which is their principal\r\nedifice. They have also churches at Camp Hill and New John Street West.\r\n\r\n=The Christian Brethren= have a head place of worship at the Central\r\nHall, Great Charles Street, and other meeting places in Green Lane\r\n(Small Heath), New John Street West, Camp Hill, and Icknield Port Road\r\nin the Borough, and four others in the outskirts.\r\n\r\nSeveral other religious bodies have only one or two places of worship,\r\nand among these may be named--\r\n\r\n=The Bloomsbury Institution= Mission Hall, in Bloomsbury Street.\r\n\r\n=The Boatmen’s Hall= in Bridge Street (Broad Street).\r\n\r\n=The Catholic Apostolic Church=, in Summer Hill Terrace, a new church\r\nbuilt by the congregation formerly assembling at what was called the\r\nIrvingite Church, in Newhall Street.\r\n\r\n=The Christadelphians=, who meet in the Temperance Hall, in Temple\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n=The Church of the Saviour=, in Edward Street (Parade), built in 1847\r\nfor Mr. George Dawson, M.A., on his leaving the Mount Zion (Baptists)\r\nChapel (_q.v._). A free church, founded on the principle that common\r\nChristian worship and pursuit of religious truth, and not doctrinal\r\nagreement, are the true bases of Christian union.\r\n\r\n=The Jewish Synagogue=, in Blucher Street, top of Severn Street, was\r\nbuilt in 1856, to supply the place of a smaller synagogue in Severn\r\nStreet. It cost upwards of £8,000.\r\n\r\n=The New Church=, or Swedenborgians, had for their first chapel the one\r\nin Newhall Street (now occupied by the Baptists, _q.v._) then, in 1830,\r\nremoved to a new chapel in Summer Lane, and subsequently, in 1875, to\r\nan elegant church, a little way over the Borough boundary, in Wretham\r\nRoad (Soho Hill).\r\n\r\n=The Welsh Calvinistic Methodists=, who have a chapel in Granville\r\nStreet (Bath Row), and another in Hockley Hill, just over the Borough\r\nboundary.\r\n\r\n=The Welsh Congregationalists= have a chapel in Wheeler Street.\r\n\r\n=Roman Catholics.=--There is no record of any Roman Catholic place of\r\nworship in Birmingham from the Reformation until the publication, by\r\nJames the Second, of the illegal Declaration of Indulgence in 1687. In\r\nthat year the foundation of a church and convent, dedicated to St. Mary\r\nMagdalene, was laid near the street still called Masshouse Lane, and\r\nprobably on the site of the present Church of St. Bartholomew (_q.v._).\r\nIt was scarcely built when it was pulled down at the Revolution of\r\n1688. The priests (who were of the order of St. Francis) removed to a\r\nfarm house in a lane near Harborne, the approach to which, at the top\r\nof Richmond Hill Road, Edgbaston, was known as Masshouse Lane.\r\n\r\nThe first chapel in the town was the one dedicated to ST. PETER, in St.\r\nPeter’s Place, a little way out of Broad Street, built in 1786, and a\r\nburial ground and schools added and subsequently enlarged.\r\n\r\nThe next was a chapel in Shadwell Street, built in 1809, and dedicated\r\nto St. Chad, which afterwards gave place to ST. CHAD’S CATHEDRAL, Bath\r\nStreet, built after the designs of A. Welby Pugin at a cost of £60,000,\r\nand consecrated June 22, 1841.\r\n\r\nST. ANNE’S, Alcester Street, was originally a distillery, and was\r\nacquired by the Fathers of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri, of whom John\r\nHenry (now Cardinal) Newman was one. In 1852, the Fathers removed to\r\nthe Hagley Road (_q.v._), and St. Anne’s became a secular mission.\r\n\r\nCHURCH OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION, Hagley Road, Edgbaston. Here, in\r\naddition to the Church, is a residence for the Fathers of the Order\r\nof St. Philip Neri, and a school for the education of the sons of the\r\nCatholic gentry. It is interesting to every educated man as having been\r\nfor more than a quarter of a century the abode of John Henry (Cardinal)\r\nNewman.\r\n\r\nST. MICHAEL’S, Moor Street, formerly the New Meeting House of the\r\nUnitarians (_q.v._), and purchased from that body in 1861, and opened\r\nin 1862.\r\n\r\nST. JOSEPH’S, Nechells, formerly only a chapel of the cemetery there\r\nserved from St. Chad’s, became a church with two priests in the year\r\n1872.\r\n\r\nST. CATHERINE OF SIENNA in the Horse Fair was consecrated September 28,\r\n1875, and\r\n\r\nST. PATRICK’S in the Dudley Road was opened in 1876.\r\n\r\nBirmingham is one of the Roman Catholic Sees created by the celebrated\r\nPapal-Decree of 29th September, 1850. To that date from 1584, when the\r\nlast of the old Roman Catholic Prelates died, the English Romanists had\r\nbeen governed in matters ecclesiastical by Vicars-Apostolic, of whom\r\nthe last and best known was Bishop (_in partibus_) afterwards Cardinal\r\nWiseman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter this enumeration of the numerous churches and chapels, which the\r\nlimited number of pages at the writer’s disposal necessarily reduces to\r\nalmost a catalogue, it may be useful to summarise the general results\r\nof the religious life of the town.\r\n\r\nIt must never be forgotten that every church and chapel is a centre\r\nof educational and philanthropic work of many kinds. The clergy of\r\nthe established church have almost a monopoly of day schools, whilst\r\nthe various denominations of dissenters for the most part leave the\r\neducation of the poor to the Board schools. Night schools are common\r\nto both churches and chapels--Sunday schools are universally attached\r\nto both. Then there are the auxiliary organisations of Bible Classes,\r\nLending Libraries, Provident Societies, Sick Clubs, Saving Clubs,\r\nClothing Clubs, Improvement Societies, Mothers’ Meetings, Dorcas\r\nSocieties, Lectures on Health and Domestic Economy by ladies, and,\r\nattached to some churches and chapels, classes for instruction in\r\nelementary Science and Literature.\r\n\r\nOf the three parties into which the established church is commonly\r\ndivided, viz., Low, High, and Broad, the general tone of the Birmingham\r\nclergy for the last fifty years has been decidedly low. A glance at the\r\ntable will shew that the rights of presentation to the mother church of\r\nSt. Martin and the other three rectories of All Saints, St. George, and\r\nSt. Thomas, and also to many of the newly-created vicarages, are vested\r\nin trustees. With the exception of two or three of the new churches,\r\nsuch as those of St. Alban the Martyr, and the Oldknow Memorial Church,\r\nthese trustees have been of the type of the Simeon Trustees.\r\n\r\nFor many years Holy Trinity, Bordesley, was the sole representative of\r\nHigh Church ritual and doctrine, both of which have made great progress\r\nthe last quarter of a century, and at many of the churches the services\r\nare distinctly “higher” than formerly. The same influences have been at\r\nwork among Nonconformists. The old pattern of meetinghouse has given\r\nplace everywhere to a more ecclesiastical style, and even where the\r\nstructure cannot be altered, the walls are coloured and decorated. The\r\ncongregational plain song of half a century ago is varied and improved\r\nby chanting and anthems, and in one Nonconformist Church may be seen a\r\nsurpliced choir.\r\n\r\nThe “Broad” Church party is scarcely represented in Birmingham, and\r\nwith the exceptions of the Head Master and some of the other Masters\r\nof the Free Grammar School, and the Rector of St. Martin’s, who, from\r\nhis position, is naturally a representative man, the Birmingham clergy\r\ndo not concern themselves much with either the political, municipal,\r\nscientific, or literary pursuits of their fellow townsmen. They have\r\nthe good reason that the work of their parishes makes such demands upon\r\nthem that they have neither time nor strength for any other labours.\r\nHence the public work of the town (with the exception of the School\r\nBoard, on which the clergy have been always strongly represented)\r\nhas for the last forty years been more influenced by the leading\r\nNonconformist ministers than by the clergy.\r\n\r\nWhilst the religious activity of the Nonconformists has not abated,\r\nthey have gained immensely in influence in all the governing bodies\r\nand public institutions. For example, for a century previous to\r\nthe year 1873, no dissenter had been elected a Governor of the\r\nFree Grammar School; now there are nine Nonconformists out of the\r\ntwenty-one Governors. The religious activity of the Church has been\r\nwidened and deepened by the development of the parochial system,\r\nwhilst the natural “set” of nonconformist activity towards political\r\nand social reforms has won for them the control of political and\r\nmunicipal affairs. This cannot be better illustrated than by a few\r\nparticulars of the composition of the Birmingham Town Council, which\r\nhas acquired the reputation of being above the average of Town Councils\r\nin the social standing and ability of its members. Of the sixty-four\r\nmembers of which the Town Council is composed, seventeen only are\r\nchurchmen. Of the sixteen Aldermen (assumed to be elected by the\r\nCouncil on account of services either exceptional in kind or duration)\r\nonly one is a churchman. The forty-seven members of the Council not\r\nbelonging to the Established Church, are composed of six Baptists,\r\nnine Congregationalists, six members of the Society of Friends, one\r\nJew, one Presbyterian, two Roman Catholics, nine Unitarians, six\r\nUndenominational, and seven members of the Wesleyan and other Methodist\r\nbodies. The preponderance of Quakers and Unitarians in the Council,\r\nin proportion to their numerical strength in the country, is very\r\nremarkable. The number of members of the Society of Friends in England\r\nand Wales, is about one to every 1,725 of the population, according to\r\nthe census of 1881. The number of their members and attendants on their\r\nservices in Birmingham, is about one to every 527 of the population of\r\nthe Borough; whilst in the Council their numbers are nearly one in ten\r\n(accurately 9.375 per cent.) or more than fifty times their numerical\r\nproportion. It is not possible to determine so accurately the number of\r\nUnitarians, but it may be safely asserted that their representation in\r\nthe Council is many times in excess of _their_ numerical proportion.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURIAL GROUNDS AND CEMETERIES.\r\n\r\nMost of the Churches built in Birmingham up to the year 1834 had\r\nchurchyards added to them. The Churchyard of St. Martin being found\r\ninadequate, nearly three acres of land in Park Street was consecrated\r\nin the year 1813 as a burial ground, and have been since laid out as a\r\npublic garden (see St. Bartholomew). There were burial grounds attached\r\nto the Old Meeting, to the Baptist Chapel, Cannon Street, and to the\r\nFriends Meeting House; there was also a piece of ground in Walmer Lane,\r\nappropriated by a Congregationalist, Joseph Scott, for the burial of\r\nProtestant Dissenters (A.D. 1779). There were also burial grounds for\r\nthe Jewish Community in a spot called the Froggery, now part of New\r\nStreet Station, in Granville Street and Betholom Row.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, a joint stock company was formed for constructing the General\r\nCemetery at Key Hill--the area of which is about twelve acres.\r\nDivided from it by Pitsford Street is the Church of England Cemetery,\r\nconsecrated in 1848. In 1850 the Catholic Cemetery of St. Joseph was\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nBy successive orders in Council most of the intra-mural burial grounds\r\nwere closed, and in the year 1860 the Corporation purchased 105 acres\r\nof land at Witton for a Borough Cemetery. Of this area, fifty-three\r\nacres are consecrated for use by members of the Established Church;\r\nthirty-five are set apart for Nonconformists, two acres and a half\r\nhave been sold for the use of the Hebrew Community, and the residue is\r\nappropriated for the use of Roman Catholics. There are four distinct\r\nbuildings for the use of the Church of England, Roman Catholics,\r\nNonconformists, and Jews. To this Cemetery the coffins from Scott’s\r\nburial ground (72), Cannon Street Chapel (142), and the Old Meeting\r\nHouse (1503), have been removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nART.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Architecture.=--[By J. A. COSSINS.]--Although anciently possessing a\r\nChurch, a Priory and a Castle, Birmingham now retains hardly a vestige\r\nof the work of the builders of the middle ages. When the old Parish\r\nChurch of St. Martin was pulled down in 1872 to make way for its very\r\nfine successor, the indications of its history, hidden for nearly two\r\ncenturies by a casing of brickwork, were revealed: traces were found of\r\nthe work of the 12th and 13th centuries, and considerable remains of\r\nwhat must have been a fine building, mainly of the 14th century. The\r\naltar tombs, with effigies of the Lords de Birmingham, were carefully\r\npreserved and refixed in the new Church, and are well worthy of\r\nexamination.[40]\r\n\r\nA few houses of the framed timber and plaster construction common in\r\nthe 17th century, remain in Digbeth, and one of a very interesting kind\r\nwas this year removed from the corner of Bull Street. The earliest in\r\ndate is the Old Crown House, which is probably of the first half of\r\nthe 16th century. This was a very interesting specimen of the more\r\nmassively constructed, but simpler kind, with gables at the extremities\r\nof the front, and a central porch of two stories; but the whole of\r\nthe ground floor was reconstructed about twenty years ago, and it has\r\nrecently been further disfigured by painting and graining. At Camp\r\nHill there is a very fine half-timbered house in good preservation.\r\nThis has the date 1601 cut on the porch. Most of the houses burnt by\r\nPrince Rupert, when he sacked the town in 1643, were probably of the\r\nhalf-timbered kind, since several still remain.\r\n\r\nST. PHILIP’S CHURCH.--From this time there is nothing to mark the\r\narchitectural progress of the town until the important event of the\r\nmaking by Act of Parliament, passed in 1711, of a new parish of St.\r\nPhilip in Birmingham. This was immediately followed by the building of\r\nthe Church of St. Philip, a remarkably good example of the School of\r\nEnglish Renaissance founded by Wren and continued by his pupils, of\r\nwhom the architect of this Church, Thomas Archer, was one of the most\r\nsuccessful. The first stone of the Church was laid in 1711, and it was\r\nconsecrated in 1715. It is a large building, the area divided into nave\r\nand aisles by square, fluted pillars, carrying semicircular arches, and\r\nsupporting galleries which extend over the aisles. With the exception\r\nof the steeple, the whole has been restored, and within the last year\r\nthe chancel, which was but a shallow recess, has been lengthened by one\r\nbay. The fine east window by Mr. Burne Jones, a native of Birmingham,\r\nis considered to be one of his most successful works.\r\n\r\nThe building of the Church was soon followed by the erection of rows\r\nof houses of an uniform character on the north and south sides of the\r\nchurchyard. These have nearly all disappeared: they were built of brick\r\nin the good domestic style of the early part of the last century, with\r\npicturesque doorways, with curved and broken pediments, balustraded\r\nparapets, and heavy white sashes with broad moulded frames. The\r\ninteriors had fine oak staircases with turned and twisted balusters,\r\nand were good examples of the cheery home-like dwellings of their\r\ntime. Other buildings, forming “The Old Square,” of a somewhat similar\r\ncharacter, have lately been pulled down to make way for a new street,\r\nand very little that is even as old as the “Georges” will be left us\r\nafter a very short time.\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN HALL.--The building of the Town Hall, begun in 1832, was\r\nthe first great local architectural event of the present century. It\r\nwas designed by Messrs. Hansom & Welch, architects, of Liverpool, in\r\nprofessed imitation of the Corinthian Temple of Jupiter Stator at Rome,\r\nbut it falls far below its prototype in the scale and richness of the\r\n“order.” To properly adapt a temple of the Romans to the various wants\r\nand requirements of a Town Hall for the people of Birmingham required\r\nconsiderable inventive skill, and to obtain the required height the\r\ntemple was mounted on a lofty rusticated basement. The grand flights\r\nof steps to the colonnades, which add so much dignity to the Greek\r\nand Roman temples, are here accessible only by means of a ladder. It\r\nis nevertheless a noble building, of Anglesey marble, though what we\r\nadmire in the exterior is due to the ancient architect, and not to the\r\nadapters. The interior is well suited to its many and varied uses, but\r\nthe entrances are narrow and undignified, and the lobbies insufficient.\r\n\r\nTHE FREE GRAMMAR SCHOOL, or King Edward’s School, was founded on the\r\nproperty belonging to the Gild of the Holy Cross, taken possession of\r\nby Henry VIII., and restored to the town by Edward VI. in the shape\r\nof an educational endowment. The old hall used by the Gild stood\r\non the site of the present school, and it is probable that it was\r\nused as a school until new buildings were erected in 1707. Of that\r\nedifice drawings are in existence, which show it to have been of two\r\nstoreys, and forming three sides of a quadrangle, with a tower over\r\nthe central and chief entrance, terminated by a cupola. The buildings\r\nwere of brick, with stone dressings; the windows square-headed, of the\r\nheavy-sashed description used in the domestic architecture of the time.\r\nA high balustraded parapet hid the roofs from sight.\r\n\r\nThe School was pulled down in 1832, and the present noble building\r\nerected on its site. The style is that of the latter half of the\r\nfifteenth century, commonly called Tudor, and although erected so\r\nsoon after the revival of Gothic architecture, it has scarcely been\r\nexcelled for boldness and propriety of design or for purity of detail.\r\nIt forms on plan a nearly equal-sided square. The chief front, facing\r\nNew Street, has slightly projecting wings, in which are fine Oriel\r\nwindows, of two stories, the intermediate length being divided by\r\nboldly projecting buttresses, terminated by crocketed pinnacles, into\r\nnine bays of two stories in height. The entrance is in the middle bay,\r\nthrough a handsome moulded and carved doorway, to a vestibule finely\r\ngroined in stone. The upper floor of the central part of the front is\r\nnow occupied by the Girls’ School, and is lighted by grand traceried\r\nand transomed windows of three lights. The south front, looking towards\r\nthe railway station, contains the Boys’ School, and is of a simpler,\r\nbut quite as good a design as the main elevation. The two principal\r\nschoolrooms are very fine, with open timber roofs. The architect was\r\nSir Charles Barry, and a striking similarity between the details of\r\nthis building and of those of the Houses of Parliament of about this\r\ntime may be observed.\r\n\r\nCHRIST CHURCH.--Christ Church, consecrated in 1813, stands at the\r\njunction of New Street with Ann Street, and occupies the most prominent\r\nand the best position in the town, but is quite unworthy of its site.\r\nIt is in the quasi-Classic style prevailing in the time of George\r\nIII., with a lofty but ill-proportioned tower and spire, and a western\r\nportico of the Roman Doric order.\r\n\r\nST. PETER’S.--Several of the churches succeeding the last were built\r\nby the well known Thomas Rickman; among these were St. Peter’s in Dale\r\nEnd, a heavy, uninteresting building, with a Grecian Doric portico,\r\nsurmounted by a “Temple-of-the-Winds”-like structure as a steeple.\r\n\r\nST. THOMAS’S.--St. Thomas’s, at Holloway Head, another of Rickman’s, is\r\ndesigned in the same spirit, but with details of the Ionic order. Some\r\nof the earliest efforts of the revival of Gothic architecture were made\r\nhere by Rickman, the most important of which,\r\n\r\nST. GEORGE’S, a large perpendicular structure, is for its time fairly\r\ngood, but the details are thin and wiry.\r\n\r\nA number of cheap churches followed in the first half of the present\r\ncentury, none of them deserving of notice; but some better things were\r\nbeing done.\r\n\r\nST. CHAD’S.--The Roman Catholic Cathedral Church of St. Chad, in Bath\r\nStreet, by the elder Pugin, though in some parts bare and mean from\r\nwant of funds, shews the genius of the architect in its plan, its\r\nimposing interior, and its fine western front.\r\n\r\nOf the churches of quite modern date, we have first the rebuilt Mother\r\nChurch of St. Martin before referred to. The tower was re-cased and the\r\nspire rebuilt in 1854-5, and in 1873-5 the present building was erected\r\nby Mr. J. A. Chatwin, architect, of Birmingham, and completed in 1875,\r\nat a cost of £28,256. The style is Gothic, as it had become perfected\r\nin the middle of the 14th century, and it has been used by the\r\narchitect with great skill and judgment. The interior is exceedingly\r\nfine, and the exterior not unworthy of it. Preserved in the north and\r\nsouth chapels at the east end, are the fine sepulchral monuments of\r\nthe Lords de Birmingham. It has excellent stained glass windows by Wm.\r\nMorris, Hardman, and others.\r\n\r\nST. AUGUSTINE’S and the LEA MEMORIAL CHURCH, both at Edgbaston, are\r\nalso fine churches by the same architect. The noble spire of the former\r\nis a conspicuous and beautiful object from a large extent of country.\r\n\r\nASTON CHURCH has lately been rebuilt by Mr. Chatwin, with the exception\r\nof the tower and spire, at a cost of £15,000. The church contains\r\nmany monuments of the Erdingtons, Ardens, Holts, Devereux, and other\r\nWarwickshire families. The very beautiful tower and spire are of the\r\n15th century.\r\n\r\nHANDSWORTH PARISH CHURCH has also been rebuilt by the same architect,\r\nwith the exception of the tower and the “Watt Chapel.” Besides the\r\nmonument by Chantry to James Watt, there are interesting monuments to\r\nBoulton, Murdock, and other local celebrities.\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH OF ST. ALBAN, in Conybere Street, lately erected by Mr.\r\nHansom, of London, in the style of the 13th century, has an extremely\r\nfine interior, groined throughout with stone. The tower and spire are\r\nunfinished.\r\n\r\nAnother good church by the same architect, is that of ST. CATHERINE (R.\r\nC.) in the Horse Fair, also with unfinished tower and spire.\r\n\r\nTHE DISSENTING CONGREGATIONS have some noteworthy buildings. Amongst\r\nthose of the Unitarians, the Church of the Messiah, in Broad Street,\r\nby Mr. Bateman, and the “Old Meeting Trust” Church, in the Bristol\r\nRoad, lately erected by Mr. J. A. Cossins, are the most important. The\r\nBaptists have two handsome churches, the Church of the Redeemer, in\r\nHagley Road, by Cubitt, of London, and Wycliffe Church, by the late\r\nMr. Cranston, in Bristol Street. The Catholic Apostolic Church of the\r\nIrvingites, in the “Sand Pits,” is a bold building of brick and terra\r\ncotta, with a noble nave, by Mr. Chatwin.\r\n\r\nTHE MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS of the town, with the exception of the Town\r\nHall, are nearly all of quite recent construction. First among these\r\nis the Council House in Colmore Row, near the top of New Street. This\r\nnoble and commodious building was opened in 1878, and comprises a\r\ngrand suite of reception rooms, a fine Council Chamber, semicircular\r\non plan, offices for the Mayor, Town Clerk, Surveyor, Treasurer, Chief\r\nof Police and other officers, and a large number of committee rooms.\r\nThe approaches, staircases and corridors are all handsome and spacious.\r\nThe fronts are constructed of Derbyshire stone in the Italian style,\r\nthe principal elevation towards Colmore Row consisting of an imposing\r\ncentre, with _porte-cocher_, and wings. The tympanums of the pediments\r\nare filled with groups of sculpture, and the large arch over the\r\nportico contains some fine work in Mosaic by Salviati. The architect\r\nwas Mr. Yeoville Thomason.\r\n\r\nART GALLERY.--Adjoining the Council House, is the Art Gallery, by the\r\nsame architect, which forms with it one block of buildings surrounding\r\na quadrangle. This was opened last year, and is a series of galleries\r\nprobably not excelled by any in England. The principal feature of the\r\ninterior is a vast domed circular room, from which the other rooms are\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nTHE PAROCHIAL OFFICES, in Edmund and Newhall Streets, by Mr. Ward,\r\nform a large and handsome block, containing the offices of the Poor\r\nLaw Guardians, the Superintendent Registrar of Births, Deaths and\r\nMarriages, &c.\r\n\r\nTHE GALLERIES OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTISTS, New Street.--The principal\r\nroom is circular, 52 feet in diameter, and there are several other\r\nrooms, which, with the fine Corinthian Portico, were completed in 1829.\r\nThey have since been much improved and enlarged, and now form a very\r\nexcellent set of galleries.\r\n\r\nTo describe properly the Educational Buildings of the town would\r\nrequire a volume; a few only of the principal ones can be noticed.\r\nThe Grammar School, the oldest of them, has already been referred\r\nto. The Mason College, founded by the late Sir Josiah Mason, is a\r\nfine building of brick and stone in Edmund street, the first stone of\r\nwhich was laid in 1875, and the building opened in October, 1880. This\r\ninstitution comprises large and complete Laboratories for Chemistry,\r\nPhysics, Physiology, Botany, and Engineering; four Lecture Theatres,\r\nand a very great number of class and other rooms of all sizes, suited\r\nto their varied requirements, the whole covering an area of about 2,500\r\nsquare yards. The style of Architecture is that of the 13th century.\r\nThe principal front in Edmund Street, of about 150 feet in length,\r\nis symmetrically arranged with a lofty centre and gabled side wings.\r\nThe principal entrance in the middle of the front is a very large and\r\ndeeply recessed moulded and shafted archway opening to a fine groined\r\nvestibule, the cross passages leading from which are also groined in\r\nstone. Over the entrance is a lofty double oriel beneath a gable,\r\nthe terminal of which is a mermaid (the crest of Sir Josiah Mason),\r\n122 feet from the pavement. The cost was about £60,000, including\r\nthe elaborate and costly fittings of the laboratories. The whole of\r\nthe buildings and fittings were designed by Mr. Jethro A. Cossins,\r\nArchitect, of Birmingham.\r\n\r\nTHE BIRMINGHAM AND MIDLAND INSTITUTE and the FREE LIBRARIES form one\r\nunited group. The Institute buildings, by Mr. Edward Barry, were opened\r\nin 1856 by the Prince Consort. The completion of the design to receive\r\nthe Reference and Lending Libraries was carried out by Messrs. Martin\r\nand Chamberlain; the whole has since been largely added to, the Lending\r\nand Reference Libraries have been rebuilt, and a new wing erected in\r\nParadise Street, by the same architects.\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL OF ART, also by Martin & Chamberlain, in Edmund Street, is\r\nin the very original modern Gothic style, almost created by the late J.\r\nH. Chamberlain, and practised with such great success by the firm to\r\nwhich he belonged. The School is perhaps the finest of their works, and\r\npossesses a rare grace and refinement in every detail. The arrangements\r\nfor the convenience of masters and students are also excellent.\r\n\r\nBOARD SCHOOLS.--Since the passing of the Elementary Education Act, in\r\n1870, about thirty large Board Schools have been erected in the town,\r\nmost of them by Messrs. Martin and Chamberlain, they are nearly all of\r\ngreat excellence and are ornaments to the town.\r\n\r\nTHE EXCHANGE, in Stephenson Place, was built in 1865, by Mr. Edward\r\nHolmes, architect, of Birmingham, and has since been considerably\r\nenlarged. It has a large exchange room on the ground floor, over a\r\npart of which is a room for assemblies. The building also contains a\r\nRestaurant, shops on the ground floor, and a large number of offices.\r\nThe fronts, towards Stephenson Place and New Street, in a Gothic style,\r\nare lofty and imposing.\r\n\r\nTHE “ARCADES” are a feature of modern Birmingham. The Great Western\r\nArcade was built in 1876, at a cost of £70,000. Mr. W. H. Ward, of\r\nBirmingham, was the architect. The avenue, four hundred feet long, has\r\neighty-four shops on two stories, the upper tier opening to a balcony.\r\nThe length is divided equally by a circular space covered by a lofty\r\ndome. The glazed roof is carried by a series of semicircular arches,\r\nthe perspective effect of which is very striking.\r\n\r\nIn an almost straight line with the last, and only divided from it by\r\nthe width of a street, is the North Western Arcade, by Mr. W. Jenkins.\r\nIn its general features it is much like the first, but of greater\r\nwidth, and the shops are larger.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that these arcades have been financially a great\r\nsuccess, and are much used as a convenient and pleasant thoroughfare\r\nfrom the Great Western Station to Corporation Street.\r\n\r\nThere are several other arcades in the town, some of which are worthy\r\nof a visit.\r\n\r\nUntil the passing of the Street Improvement Act of 1876, Birmingham had\r\nbut very few streets that were worthy of the size and importance of the\r\ntown. New Street is, however, a fine and picturesque thoroughfare, the\r\nslight rise and easy curve contributing very much to the general effect.\r\n\r\nCORPORATION STREET, leading from New Street, opposite the entrance to\r\nthe Railway Station, to the Aston Road, has been but lately formed; it\r\nis not yet entirely finished, but is already an unusually fine street.\r\nMany of the buildings are of great height and costliness. It promises\r\nto be one of the noblest thoroughfares to be found in any of our great\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nASTON HALL.--Sir Thomas Holte, whose family had long been resident\r\nat Duddeston, in the parish of Aston, began to build this magnificent\r\nhouse in 1618, and in 1631 he came to reside in it. In 1864 it was\r\npurchased by the Corporation of Birmingham, together with forty-three\r\nacres of the once extensive park, immediately surrounding it, and in\r\nthe same year it was thrown open to the public. Dugdale, who wrote\r\nwhilst the Hall was fresh from the hands of the builders, calls it “a\r\nnoble fabric, which for beauty and state much exceedeth any in these\r\nparts,” and the same may yet be said of it. It is well situated on\r\nhigh ground at a distance of about two miles from Stephenson Place,\r\nand retains about it some of the grand old chestnut and other trees\r\nfor which the park was famous. Most of the outbuildings, including the\r\nstables, houses of the Chief Falconer and other officers, and the chief\r\nentrance lodge also remain, and add much to the interest and general\r\neffect. The principal front, approached by what remains of the Chestnut\r\nTree Avenue, is symmetrically arranged, and consists of a central block\r\nwith wings of considerable projection, enclosing a court of which one\r\nside is open to the East. The chief entrance door in the middle of\r\nthe front is under a square tower furnished with a lofty ogee curved\r\nroof, each of the wings has also a door from the court, under a similar\r\ntower. The towers, the curved gables, and the lofty bay windows which\r\nterminate the wings, combine in producing an extremely picturesque and\r\nimposing effect. The windows are all square headed and mullioned, the\r\nwalling is of thin bricks, with windows, doors, and other important\r\ndetails of stone.\r\n\r\nThe entrance hall is fine and lofty, and the principal staircase with\r\nmassive square newels and scroll work balustrade is extremely rich in\r\neffect. The great drawing room, the dining room, Lady Holte’s room,\r\nand the great gallery, 136 feet long, are all grand apartments with\r\nelaborate ceilings in intricate geometrical patterns, rich cornices,\r\nand magnificent chimney pieces. Besides those mentioned, there are\r\na great number of rooms of less importance. Many of the principal\r\napartments contain collections of great interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Painting.=--[By E. R. TAYLOR.]--For the opening of the Corporation\r\nArt Gallery in November, 1885, the large room was filled with a loan\r\ncollection of pictures by Mr. G. F. Watts, R.A., and Mr. E. Burne\r\nJones, A.R.A. These works, together with others of a decorative\r\ncharacter, belonging to the town, have enabled the Birmingham public to\r\nview, for the first time, the highest phases of English Art.\r\n\r\nThe history of Art proves that, when the nobler walks of Painting and\r\nSculpture reach a high standard of execution, decorative character, and\r\npoetic insight, Art, as applied to manufactures, makes corresponding\r\nprogress. Decorative and poetic art in painting as seen in the works\r\nof Leighton, Watts, Burne Jones, Rossetti, Mason, Richmond, Albert\r\nMoore, Walter Crane, and others is, therefore, of special interest to\r\na manufacturing town like Birmingham. So long as these men exhibit the\r\npossibilities of decorative art, their work must be fraught with good\r\nto those engaged in applying similar principles to art manufactures,\r\nand (what is of equal importance) must educate those who are to be\r\nusers of art productions.\r\n\r\nBIRMINGHAM ARTISTS.--The names of at least two Birmingham men will ever\r\nhold a prominent place in the annals of English Art,--David Cox and E.\r\nBurne Jones; and as, from his residence here and his being a member of\r\nthe Royal Society of Artists in this town, George Mason may also be\r\nfairly considered a local man, Birmingham may be said to have produced\r\nthree great Masters--each perhaps the highest in his particular\r\nbranch--in the three most characteristic phases and developments of\r\nEnglish Art. Of this the town may be justly proud.\r\n\r\nDAVID COX.--David Cox was born in Birmingham in 1783. His birth-place\r\nwas near to “The Old Crown,” a noted ancient timbered house in\r\nDeritend. He received his early art instruction from Joseph Barber, who\r\nconducted an academy close to the site of the present Municipal School\r\nof Art. In the mastership of that academy, Joseph Barber was succeeded\r\nby his son, J. Vincent Barber. A few doors away, Samuel Lines carried\r\non a drawing school. These were the only means of art instruction in\r\nthe town until the formation of the Society of Arts, whose work is now\r\ncontinued in the above-mentioned Municipal School. Cox was apprenticed\r\nfor eighteen months to a miniature painter on lockets and snuff boxes.\r\nOwing to the bankruptcy of his master, his engagement was terminated\r\nat the end of that period. He afterwards became scene painter at the\r\nBirmingham Theatre, then under the management of the elder Macready.\r\nJohn Varley, the famous water-colour painter, and Müller also gave\r\nhim a few lessons in water-colours and oils, respectively. Thus Cox\r\nreceived what was for his day a fairly good education in art, if in\r\nthis we include his initiation first into miniature painting and then\r\ninto scene painting.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 he was elected a member of the Society of Painters in Water\r\nColours. During his whole career, he seems to have possessed a strong\r\naffection for his native place; and, as soon as he was freed from\r\nthe worries and anxieties of teaching, he came to Greenfield House,\r\nHarborne, where he spent the last eighteen years of his life, working\r\nat his beloved art, and paying visits, from time to time, to favourite\r\nBettws-y-Coed. He died in 1859.\r\n\r\nCox was contemporary with Constable and Crowe. All three received\r\nbut slight recognition of their merits while living; but since death\r\ntheir work has been highly praised and much sought after. Yet these\r\nmen--and Cox particularly--were the first to carry out that direct\r\nstudy from nature which has become the characteristic of the English\r\nschool, as distinct from the studio compositions and artificialities\r\nwhich flourished from the time of Claude to their own. There is every\r\nprobability that the love for English scenery--scenery so full of\r\ncolour and character; so varied and so changeful--has been greatly\r\nstimulated amongst the people by the fact that these artists have\r\nportrayed its beauties in their paintings, and have thus instilled a\r\nperception of, and love for, these beauties in nature.\r\n\r\nOf the works of Cox, the Art Gallery contains thirty-three oil\r\npaintings (the Nettlefold Bequest), and two or three water-colours.\r\nThis is perhaps the finest collection of his oil colours extant, and\r\namong it may be specially mentioned: “Sheep Shearing” (27) and “Driving\r\nCattle” (28), both full in colour, and simple and direct in execution;\r\nwhile “Changing Pasture” (9) may be cited as one of his best works. In\r\nthe picture last mentioned, the sunset sky, the purplish blue distance,\r\nand the truth of the light in the middle distance and foreground should\r\nreceive particular attention. “In the Hayfield” (26) is more in his\r\nwater-colour manner; as is also his grand “Rhyl Sands” (10), in which\r\nthe effect of the sea breeze is felt all over the picture. “Bettws\r\nChurch” (11), “Tending Sheep, Bettws-y-Coed” (12), and “Evening”\r\n(24) are excellent examples of that quiet and unaffected, yet highly\r\npoetic treatment by which he ennobled the simplest materials; while\r\n“The Shrimpers” (31) is perhaps the best of his pictures of a sandy\r\nshore. “The Missing Lamb” (2) is interesting, in that it shows his\r\nmethod of commencing work. “Asking the Way” (40) is a fine example\r\nof his water-colours. In the midst of these beautiful specimens of\r\nCox’s labour is placed “The Late David Cox” (17), by Sir John Watson\r\nGordon--one of the most successful portraits of a great artist by a\r\nbrother artist. Alike by its success and the evident sympathy between\r\npainter and subject, the work recalls the portrait of Hook by Sir J. E.\r\nMillais.\r\n\r\nWhilst a careful study of Cox’s life and pictures, of his earnest\r\nand loving methods of work, and of the glorious harvest therefrom\r\nresulting, has had a highly beneficial effect on the world of Art,\r\nthere is no doubt that from the sudden rise in value of his pictures,\r\nand the consequent magnifying of any scrap of paper his hand had\r\ntouched, as well as from the fact that the work of his latest and\r\nbroadest style was most accessible, a certain servile imitation of his\r\nmannerisms, supplanted the earnest and loving study of nature, which\r\ncharacterised Cox to the end. These mannerisms, which by long study\r\nhe had earned the right to use, and which in his work were always\r\nfull of meaning, too often became in the productions of his imitators\r\nmeaningless and pretentious. Time, however, is curing this evil; and\r\nthe good alone will remain. As an example of the enormous increase in\r\nthe monetary value of his pictures, it may be stated that “Lancaster\r\nsands,” for which Cox received £10, was sold at the Gillott sale for\r\n3,000 guineas.\r\n\r\nGEORGE MASON.--The work of George Mason, A.R.A. (born 1818; died\r\n1872), marks a further development of English Art. He, like Frederick\r\nWalker, opened up still deeper poetic sympathies for us. During the\r\nvaried phases of humanity, its toil and its rest, were no longer\r\ntreated as mere accessories to the landscape, but as a large and\r\nessential part of it; not inserted to give a point, or story, or bit of\r\ncolour to the picture, but intended from the beginning to essentially\r\nform a part of its growth as a work of art. And even when there is\r\nno human incident poetically treated, as in his “Evening Hymn,” or\r\n“Harvest Moon,” there is something in his schemes of colour or other\r\ntreatment of his landscape which occurs to awaken a human interest\r\nnever reached even by Cox or Turner. This school has had the strongest\r\nand widest influence on the English Art of to-day. It is greatly to be\r\nregretted that the Birmingham Art Gallery contains no examples of the\r\nworks of George Mason.\r\n\r\nE. BURNE JONES.--The third phase is that represented by Mr. E. Burne\r\nJones and Mr. Watts. This being the most recent development, its force\r\ncannot yet be measured; but there is little doubt that it will be the\r\ngreatest of the three. For six months after the opening of the gallery,\r\none end of the large room aforesaid was filled with a magnificent\r\ncollection of the works of Mr. Burne Jones; and at a recent exhibition\r\nof the Birmingham Society of Artists, was shewn his noblest work, “The\r\nSix Days of Creation.”\r\n\r\nThe sale of the Graham collection has dispersed most of these. Perhaps\r\nno previous sale had evoked so much interest,--not even that of the\r\nGillott collection. The enthusiasm then evinced, as well as the large\r\nprices obtained, shew that the work of the artist is already receiving\r\njust recognition. In addition to “The Six Days of Creation,” there were\r\n(_e.g._) exhibited at Birmingham “Le Chant d’Amour,” “Venus’s Mirror,”\r\n“The Beguiling of Merlin,” “Love in the Ruins,” “Love Disguised as\r\nReason,” but as these are no longer here, it is unnecessary now to\r\ndescribe them. “The Feast of Peleus” has been lent by its fortunate\r\npossessor, Mr. Alderman Kenrick, M.P. This picture--at least from an\r\nartist’s point of view--is one of the painter’s most beautiful works.\r\nAt the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, the Goddess of Discord throws\r\ndown a golden apple, to be claimed by the most beautiful. Juno, Venus,\r\nand Minerva rise eagerly to claim it. In the foreground are three\r\nfates. The composition, drawing, scheme of colour, and marvellous\r\nrealization even of the minutest details of form and colour render this\r\nwork one of exceptionally high character, and, taken as a whole, the\r\nmost enjoyable of all the artist’s productions.\r\n\r\nAttention may also be here directed to the fact that there have been\r\nplaced in St. Martin’s and St. Philip’s Churches, Birmingham, two\r\nlovely stained glass windows, both designed by Mr. Burne Jones. The\r\nartist’s practice in stained glass, tempera, and mosaic has, no doubt,\r\ngreatly influenced his style of composition and colour.\r\n\r\nMUNICIPAL GALLERY.--Pictures by the following Birmingham artists, named\r\nalphabetically, belong to the Corporation:--\r\n\r\nBaker, Alfred--(an artist of great promise, who died when\r\nyoung)--“Harvest Time.”\r\n\r\nBaker, S. H.--“Nant Gwylt.”\r\n\r\nBreakspeare, W. A.--“The Daughter of the House.”\r\n\r\nBurt, C. T.--“The Edge Hills, from Burton Dassett.”\r\n\r\nFeeney, P. M.--“Llyn Idwal.”\r\n\r\nHall, W.--(David Cox’s most intimate friend and biographer)--“A Peep\r\nout of Church, Bettws-y-Coed.” This picture is interesting as depicting\r\na scene in the art-home of Cox.\r\n\r\nHenshaw, F. H.--Three fine landscapes, of which the best is “A Distant\r\nView of Kenilworth Castle.”\r\n\r\nLangley, Walter, R.I.--“Memories”--an excellent example of this artist,\r\nwho has already by his work done much honour to Birmingham. It shows\r\nhis deep sympathy with the humble life of English fisher folk, and is\r\nadmirable in execution, lighting, and colour.\r\n\r\nLines, Samuel--“Llyn Idwal.”\r\n\r\nMunns, H. T.--Portraits.\r\n\r\nPhillips T., R.A.--Portrait of Sir John Franklin.\r\n\r\nPratt, Jonathan--Portraits.\r\n\r\nRoden, W. T.--Portraits.\r\n\r\nTaylor, Edward R.--“The Birmingham Reference Library, Destroyed by\r\nFire, January, 1879.”\r\n\r\nWalton, Elijah--“Monte Tofana in Tyrol.”\r\n\r\nWyatt, H.--“Juliet.”\r\n\r\nOne other name should be included in any list of Birmingham artists.\r\nIt is that of Mr. W. J. Wainwright, A.R.W.S., who has accepted a\r\ncommission for the Art Gallery.\r\n\r\nIn the circular picture gallery will be found the admirable series of\r\nhistorical works by Sir James D. Sinton, P.R.I., representing scenes in\r\nthe life of a soldier in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nAmong the portraits of special local interest are those by Mr. W. T.\r\nRoden, of Samuel Lines, the Birmingham artist; of Peter Hollins, the\r\nBirmingham sculptor; of his Eminence Cardinal Newman; and of John Henry\r\nChamberlain, who has been justly described as the “second founder of\r\nthe Birmingham and Midland Institute,” and who, until his lamented\r\ndeath, was Chairman of the School of Art. Those of John Bright, by\r\nFrank Holt, R.A.; of George Dawson, by H. T. Munns; of William Murdock,\r\nby John Graham; of Arthur Ryland, the founder of the Birmingham and\r\nMidland Institute, and sometime Mayor of the town, by Sir J. W. Gordon;\r\nand of Sir John Franklin, by T. Phillips, R.A., also deserve note in\r\nthis connexion.\r\n\r\nWATTS AND PORTRAITS.--The large room of the Art Gallery is nearly\r\nfilled with a collection of Mr. Watt’s pictures, kindly lent by the\r\nartist. Much interest now attaches to these works, as Mr. Watts\r\nhas just offered them, with others, to the nation. We can somewhat\r\nmeasure this noble gift when we remember that the collection contains\r\nportraits of some of our ablest and most famous men, as well as large\r\nand important figure pictures, the work of a lifetime, and that these\r\nare the best works of an artist of world-wide reputation. The English\r\nSchool of portraiture has attained a high standard in the works of\r\nsuch artists as Millais, Holl, Ouless, and Richmond; but the portraits\r\nby Watts stand apart from even these in their nobility of treatment,\r\nscheme of colour, and rendering of the man, his very life and soul.\r\nThe portraits of Mr. Burne Jones, the Marquis of Salisbury, and Lady\r\nGarvagh, recall to mind the best works of Reynolds and Gainsborough.\r\nAgain, Dr. Joachim, a lamp-light study--is quite Rembrandt like.\r\nThose of Cardinal Manning, Carlyle, Mr. Browning, Mrs. Manners, in\r\nblue against a blue background; John Stuart Mill, Lord Lawrence, Lord\r\nSherbrook and Philip Calderon, R.A., also merit careful observation.\r\nMr. Watts’s subject pictures are painted with the noblest motives,\r\nand the methods of execution and schemes of colour are all made\r\nsubordinate to the idea. The subject “Love and Death,” was suggested by\r\nthe struggle of near friends to resist a fatal disease in a young man\r\nwhom the artist was painting; and here the power of art, imagination,\r\ncolour, conception, drawing of drapery and figure, all unite, not for\r\ntechnical display, but to realize in an intense degree the motive\r\nof the picture. The same may be said of “Mammon;” dedicated to his\r\nworshippers. In the previous picture the colour is blue-grey; in this\r\nit is gold and scarlet. “The Meeting of Jacob and Esau” is a striking\r\ninstance of the successful definition of opposite characters. “Orpheus\r\nand Eurydice” is descriptive of the moment when Orpheus looks back,\r\nand when, by reason of this act of impatience, Eurydice sinks back to\r\nHades. “Fata Morgana,” turning on her followers through life, is also a\r\nsplendid work.\r\n\r\nThis room further contains the large painting by Professor W. B.\r\nRichmond, M.A., entitled “An Audience in Athens during a Representation\r\nof the Agamemnon.” This, too, is a most valuable decorative work of Art\r\nin the attitudes, costumes and expressions of the audience, and in the\r\nrendering in colour and tone of the clear sunlight of Greece. Other\r\ndecorative works in the Art Gallery are Mr. Albert Moore’s “Dreamers,”\r\nlovely figures most delicately painted in a scheme of yellow orange,\r\ngrey and green; “Sapphires,” blue and orange; and “Canaries,” yellow\r\norange and grey, with a little green. On a screen will also be found a\r\nsmall but very fine collection of works in water-colour by Mr. Walter\r\nLangley, R.I., including “Amongst the Missing,” “Time moveth not,” and\r\nmany well known works by this artist.\r\n\r\nThe town possesses one of the strongest examples of Sir Frederick\r\nLeighton, P.R.A. “A Condottiere” is quite Titianesque in its painting\r\nof flesh, armour, and drapery. One example by Mr. Alfred W. Hunt is\r\nalso the property of the town. It is called “A Norwegian Midnight,” and\r\ntherein are displayed colour, mystery, sense of space, and moving cloud\r\nforms. Two of the finest paintings by Mr. Henry Moore, A.R.A., are also\r\nincluded--“Summer Time, off Cornwall,” and “The Newhaven Packet.” Other\r\nworks in the Gallery of more than ordinary interest are: “Intellect\r\nand Instinct,” by H. Stacey Marks, R.A.; “Detected Correspondence,” by\r\nJohn Opie, R.A.; “A Martyr of the 16th Century,” by W. Geets; “February\r\nFill Dyke,” by B. W. Leader, A.R.A.; “Ready for Work,” by John S. Noble;\r\n“A North-West Gale,” by John Brett, A.R.A.; “Homeward,” by W. Napier\r\nHenry; and “The Poacher’s Widow,” by Breton Riviere, R.A.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of real congratulation to Birmingham that her sons\r\nhave taken a prominent place in the world of Art, and that, owing to\r\nan enlightened policy, the town now possesses a suitable gallery,\r\nwherein high-class works may be viewed by all. The works exhibited,\r\nwhether purchased by the Committee or on loan, are generally of such a\r\ndecorative character as to be of the greatest value to designers and\r\nother Art workmen. It is to be hoped that, stimulated by past example,\r\nas well as by present opportunities, the inhabitants will fully\r\nappreciate the importance of furthering that Art, which is at once a\r\nsource of pleasure to the workers, and of illimitable enjoyment to the\r\nbeholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sculpture.=--[By WHITWORTH WALLIS.]--The history of the birth and\r\ngrowth of sculpture, with no word for its decadence, death, and\r\nultimate renaissance would alone be a subject difficult to compress\r\ninto the space of a volume, but when there is to be added to that some\r\naccount of the art in the time of the supremacy of its achievement,\r\nbefore it became tainted with decay, the task is vast indeed.\r\nFortunately such a dissertation is not required in this place.\r\n\r\nThe art of sculpture is not restricted, as most people think, to the\r\ncarving of mere marble and stone. In its strict meaning it is the art\r\nof _cutting_ any material whatsoever into any required shape; but the\r\nword is now generally accepted for the art of representing anything by\r\nform, no matter what the material may be, or what the method of its\r\nmaking; so that the word “sculpture” applies to Sculpture proper, and\r\nto castings in bronze, as well as to the carving of gems, ivories, and\r\nto modelling in wax and clay.\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN SCULPTURE.--In every part of the world, in modern as in\r\nancient times, savage races have delighted to decorate their weapons\r\nwith carving, and to make representations of men and animals, which\r\nthey afterwards worshipped. But it was Egypt, that cradle-land of\r\nlearning and of art, which seems to be the nation where first the\r\nrudeness of savage carving was brought under restraint and nurtured\r\ninto Sculpture. What had previously been an amusement was changed by\r\ntheir priests into an art. But these very priests who first fostered\r\nthe art were ultimately the means of stunting its growth and arresting\r\nits highest development. The reverence which long ages of worship\r\ncaused the archaic statues to receive induced the priests, who were\r\nthe representatives of learning and of wisdom, to make these old types\r\nsymbolical of divine attributes, and it was considered sacrilegious to\r\nattempt to alter what had gradually come to be believed was the true\r\nlikeness of the god. Thus religion, which was the kind foster-mother\r\nof the arts of sculpture and painting, came, later on, to be its most\r\ndetermined enemy.\r\n\r\nWhilst in Egypt Sculpture was being strangled by Convention, all\r\nprogress being arrested, and all originality starved out of it by the\r\nregulations which bound it to its archaic form, a new race of artists\r\narose along the shores and amidst the islands of the Mediterranean.\r\nIn Greece Art found a new and happy home. Greek Sculpture, based on\r\nEgyptian precedent, and influenced greatly in its growth by Phœnician\r\nthought, gradually freed itself from all the trammels of the past, and\r\nformed a school of Sculpture, the results of which have never been\r\nequalled in all the after ages of art production.\r\n\r\nGREEK SCULPTURE.--It was left to the beauty-loving Greeks to perceive\r\nthat Sculpture was of all others the art by which they could best\r\nexpress and best immortalise the most perfect of all Nature’s physical\r\nbeauties. It was the Greeks who made Sculpture what it was, and with\r\ntheir school died out the highest development of the art.\r\n\r\nThe conquests of Alexander, and all that followed in their train--the\r\ntreasures of the East unfolded, mighty monarchies founded, stately\r\ncities built--afforded opportunities for the spread of this art.\r\nThus it became transplanted into strange lands, and was subjected to\r\nnew influence and aspirations. After the Macedonian and Syrian wars\r\nthe victorious Romans carried off with them the statues and other\r\nart objects from the conquered countries. Following in the train of\r\ntheir conquerors came the Greek artists themselves to Rome, but the\r\nart never became naturalised there, it soon lost all its ideality and\r\nbecame merely imitative in treatment. Under Antoninus it lost much of\r\nits grace and elegance, but the spirit of the Greek is mighty even\r\nin dying, and though it sank under Severus and his successors, its\r\ninfluence was still apparent until close upon the time of Constantine,\r\nwhen the great art of the ancients was entirely lost.\r\n\r\nITALIAN SCULPTURE.--Sculpture revived in Italy in the thirteenth\r\ncentury under Nicolo Pisano. All the remains of art which had escaped\r\ndestruction from barbarian violence, religious fanaticism, and natural\r\ncauses, were now carefully collected, and the sentiment of reverence\r\nand admiration for the antique gradually developed into that great\r\nrevival which we designate “The Renaissance.” The wealthiest and most\r\npowerful Florentine families vied with each other in the encouragement\r\nof art in all its branches, and with the artists of the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries raised modern art to its loftiest pitch of\r\nsplendour. Despite this fact it never attained the sublimity and\r\ntranquil grandeur of the antique. After the glorious epochs of Michael\r\nAngelo and Raphael a rapid decline set in. True feeling quickly\r\ndisappeared, giving way to affected grace, extravagance, and excessive\r\nornament. During the eighteenth century, Winckelmann was the first\r\nwho influenced the revival of modern art, and opened the eyes of his\r\ncontemporaries to the glories and elevated beauty of the arts of\r\nantiquity. Antonio Canova became the founder of the new period, his\r\nworks being specially marked by pure simplicity and classical ideality,\r\nand by his side stands Thorwaldsen, whose artistic productions were as\r\nadmirable as they were numerous.\r\n\r\nENGLISH SCULPTURE.--In England John Banks, who may be regarded as\r\nthe father of English ideal sculpture, paved the way for his great\r\nsuccessor John Flaxman, and the latter with his deep appreciation\r\nof severe simplicity and true form, his love and admiration for the\r\nGreek statues, brought into this country the classical spirit, and\r\nfounded the schools of the nineteenth century. To judge by the progress\r\nwhich modern sculpture has made, and by the many noble works erected\r\nof late years, it is on a far safer road than during the end of the\r\nsixteenth century. In England it is not likely that there will ever\r\nbe such a great school of sculpture as of the sister art of painting.\r\nThe greatest hope for ideal or poetic sculpture rests with the people\r\nthemselves, who must be able to appreciate and love the beautiful, and\r\nthis elevation of the taste of the public can only be accomplished by\r\nartists refusing to pander to a low ideal, but fearlessly and jealously\r\ndevoting themselves to the execution of those works which will touch\r\nthe tenderest feelings and arouse the noblest thoughts.\r\n\r\nLOCAL SCULPTURE.--Birmingham, though possessing a fair number of\r\nsculptural monuments, can boast unfortunately but of few which show\r\nreal artistic merit. In the Entrance Hall of the Free Libraries,\r\nRatcliff Place, stands Mr. Foley’s admirable statue of Prince Albert,\r\nwhich is considered to be one of his finest works. The Prince is\r\nattired in the robes of the Order of the Garter. By its side is placed\r\nthe companion statue of her Majesty the Queen, which was also entrusted\r\nto Mr. Foley. That artist unfortunately dying, the work was carried out\r\nby Mr. Woolner, R.A., with far from a pleasing result. Both statues are\r\nintended for the Council House. The largest, and certainly one of the\r\nmost prominent, monuments in Birmingham is the bronze statue erected by\r\nthe inhabitants to the memory of Admiral Lord Nelson. It is situated in\r\nHigh Street, and was executed by Sir Richard Westmacott. It represents\r\nNelson in a reposeful and dignified attitude, his left arm resting upon\r\nan anchor. The background is formed of the prow of a vessel and a sail.\r\nThe statue is mounted on a pedestal of statuary marble, embellished\r\nwith figures. The corner posts are said to be cannon formerly in use\r\non board the “Victory.” An auctioneer, who lived in High Street, left\r\nsixpence per week to be paid in perpetuity, out of the rent of a house,\r\nto be devoted to the cleaning of the statue.\r\n\r\nThe bronze statue of Sir Robert Peel, at the top of New Street, is\r\ninteresting as being the work of a talented Birmingham sculptor, Mr.\r\nPeter Hollins, and for the fact that it was the first bronze statue\r\ncast in one piece in Birmingham. The attitude of the Statesman is one\r\nof firmness; the face is very expressive, and shows strong intellectual\r\npower. Mr. Hollins likewise executed the statue erected to the memory\r\nof Sir Rowland Hill, which stands in the Post Office, Paradise Street.\r\nOf other works by this sculptor, I would draw attention to the busts of\r\nWilliam Scholefield, Mathew Davenport Hill, Q.C., and David Cox, all\r\nof which are in the Museum and Art Gallery, and a fine bust of J. W.\r\nWhateley, in the General Hospital.\r\n\r\nAt the Five ways, Edgbaston, stands the statue erected to the memory\r\nof Joseph Sturge, an eminent member of the Society of Friends. The\r\nmonument is pleasing in arrangement. The centre figure represents\r\nJoseph Sturge, his right hand resting on the Bible, his left extended\r\ntowards a figure symbolical of Peace, whilst on the other side is a\r\nfigure typical of Charity. This is reputed to be an excellent likeness\r\nof the philanthropist, and the expression is one of benevolence and\r\ntenderness. It is the work of the late John Thomas, a sculptor of some\r\neminence, who unfortunately died before he could put the finishing\r\ntouches to this memorial. Mr. Thomas was also the sculptor of the\r\nstatue of Thomas Attwood “the father of Political Unions,” situated\r\nat the top of Stephenson Place. Thomas Attwood stands in the act of\r\naddressing a public meeting, the right hand outstretched, whilst his\r\nleft grasps a scroll bearing the word “Reform.” In the Art Gallery is a\r\nfine bronze group of Boadicea and her daughters, also the work of Mr.\r\nJohn Thomas.\r\n\r\nIn front of the Council House stands the statue of Dr. Joseph\r\nPriestley, the discoverer of oxygen, who was driven from the town\r\nby a Birmingham mob, and whose property was destroyed in the riots\r\nof 1791. The statue, a very pleasing one, is the work of Mr. F. J.\r\nWilliamson, of Esher, who is also the sculptor of the adjacent statue\r\nof Mr. J. Skirrow Wright, and by the same hand is a striking bust of\r\nMr. Sam: Timmins, F.S.A., which stands in the Reference Library, and an\r\nequally admirable bust of the late Dr. Heslop, now in the Mason Science\r\nCollege. This artist also executed the latest addition to Birmingham\r\nSculpture, the statue of Sir Josiah Mason, and was also entrusted with\r\nthe statue of the late George Dawson, opposite the Art Gallery, which\r\nstands under a highly ornate canopy, designed by the late John Henry\r\nChamberlain. This statue, which is supposed to be an excellent likeness\r\nof Mr. Dawson, was executed on account of the dissatisfaction caused\r\nby the first figure, the work of Mr. Woolner, R.A. The effigy by the\r\nlatter sculptor is still most unfortunately permitted to remain in the\r\nvestibule of the Free Library.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the Town Hall, stands a Memorial Fountain, erected\r\nto commemorate the municipal services of the Right Hon. Joseph\r\nChamberlain, M.P. In the south side is a medallion portrait of Mr.\r\nChamberlain, by Mr. Thomas Woolner, R.A. The memorial, which is\r\narchitecturally treated and richly decorated with Venetian mosaics, was\r\ndesigned by the late John Henry Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nIn Ratcliff Place stands undoubtedly the finest statue in the town,\r\nthat of James Watt, by Alexander Munro. The calm dignity of the figure,\r\nthe graceful pose of the same, the grand thoughtful face, and the\r\nvery remarkable likeness of the great engineer, render it a work of\r\nthe highest excellence. The original model of the head is in the Art\r\nGallery.\r\n\r\nThe Art Gallery contains in addition to those already mentioned as\r\nlocated therein, the two original plaster models of Foley’s great\r\nstatues of Burke and Goldsmith; an interesting copy of the Venus di\r\nMedici by Raphael Monti, and some very admirable specimens of early\r\nItalian and renaissance sculpture. In the Vestibule stands a very\r\ndignified and impressive bronze statue of Buddha of Indian make, and\r\nof the greatest antiquity; and also a very remarkable piece of Hindoo\r\nsculpture in black marble.\r\n\r\nIn St. John’s, Deritend, is a memorial bust of John Rogers, who edited\r\nthe first English Bible, and was the first martyr of the reign of Queen\r\nMary.\r\n\r\nThe Parish Church of Handsworth, some little distance from Birmingham,\r\ncontains one of Sir Francis Chantrey’s most remarkable and beautiful\r\nworks, the statue of James Watt; and by the same sculptor is a fine\r\nmonument erected to the memory of William Murdock. Here is also the\r\nexcellent bust of Matthew Boulton, by John Flaxman.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Music.=--[By W. BAYLEY MARSHALL.]--The most casual observer cannot\r\nfail to notice the rapid strides which Birmingham has taken in recent\r\nyears in the cultivation of Music. We have now an orchestra of nearly\r\none hundred performers composed of citizens of the town, numerous\r\nchoral societies both public and private, well-qualified professors in\r\nall the branches of musical study, and an excellent musical club. These\r\ncombined agencies are rapidly removing the stigma which was formerly\r\nso truthfully applied--that Birmingham was like a boa-constrictor,\r\nmaking a huge meal of music once every three years, and doing little\r\nbut sleep between times. In no branch of music is this progress more\r\nmanifest than in the services of the church. Some sixteen years ago,\r\nit was quite the exception to hear even the psalms chanted; now\r\nchoral services and well-rendered anthems may be heard in most of the\r\nchurches. The limits of this article will only allow a brief reference\r\nto the principal societies and agencies engaged in the furtherance of\r\nmusic in Birmingham.\r\n\r\nTRIENNIAL FESTIVALS.--The Birmingham Triennial Festivals are now\r\nuniversally acknowledged to be the most important Music meetings in\r\nthe Kingdom. The first Festival was held in 1768. In 1799 the scale\r\nof the celebration was enlarged, and since then, with one exception,\r\nthey have been held triennially. The management is in the hands of a\r\nsmall committee, appointed by the Governors of the General Hospital,\r\nand the whole of the proceeds go to the funds of that Institution;\r\nthis has amounted to upwards of £120,000 since the foundation of the\r\nFestivals. During the period of more than a century over which the\r\nFestivals have now extended, they have attained European celebrity, and\r\nhave been distinguished by the production of a large number of original\r\nworks of the highest rank, among which may be mentioned: Mendelssohn’s\r\nLob-gesang (1840), and Elijah which was specially written for the 1846\r\nFestival; Costa’s Eli (1855), and Naaman (1864); Bennett’s Woman of\r\nSamaria (1867); Sullivan’s Kenilworth (1864), and Light of the World\r\n(1873); Smart’s Bride of Dunkerron (1864); Barnett’s Ancient Mariner\r\n(1867), and Paradise and the Peri (1870); Benedict’s St. Peter (1870);\r\nMacfarren’s Resurrection (1876); Gade’s Zion (1876) and Psyche (1882);\r\nHiller’s Nala and Damayanti (1871); Randegger’s Fridolin (1873);\r\nCowen’s Corsair (1876) and Sleeping Beauty (1885); Gounod’s Redemption\r\n(1882) and Mors et Vita (1885); Gaul’s Holy City (1882); Stanford’s\r\nThree Holy Children (1885); Dvorak’s Spectre’s Bride (1885). The next\r\nFestival will be held in 1888. Secretary, Mr. R. L. Impey, 26, Waterloo\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nFESTIVAL CHORAL SOCIETY.--The date of the foundation of the Birmingham\r\nFestival Choral Society, the premier society of the town, is unknown;\r\nin 1834, Mr. G. Hollins, the first Organist of the Town Hall was\r\nappointed conductor; upon his death in 1841, Mr. Stimpson was appointed\r\nto both offices, and the society was reorganised and established with\r\na permanent relief fund to be employed in case of sickness among its\r\nmembers. In consequence of ill-health, Mr. Stimpson resigned the\r\nconductorship in 1855, and Mr. Stockley (the present conductor),\r\nwas appointed; Mr. Stimpson continuing as organist of the town, the\r\nduties of which office he still faithfully discharges. Since 1846, the\r\nchoruses of the Musical Festivals have been mainly composed of members\r\nof the Festival Choral Society. The society gives annually a series of\r\nhigh-class subscription concerts. The management is in the hands of a\r\nCommittee of fifteen members. Secretary, Mr. S. V. Cornish, 55, Varna\r\nRoad, Edgbaston.\r\n\r\nAMATEUR HARMONIC ASSOCIATION.--The Birmingham Amateur Harmonic\r\nAssociation was established in the year 1855, and, as its name implies,\r\nis a purely Amateur Association, more for the study and practice of\r\nchoral music than for the public performance thereof.\r\n\r\nThe members have, however, done good service in placing before their\r\nfriends at open rehearsals and private concerts, from time to time,\r\na great number of works previously unknown to Birmingham, the most\r\nimportant of which are--Handel’s oratorios, Jephtha (1871) and Joshua\r\n(1872); Haydn’s First Mass (1859); Hummell’s Mass in E flat, which was\r\nspecially printed for the Association, and produced for the first time\r\nin England on December 13, 1865; Gounod’s Messe Solennelle in G (1866),\r\nGallia (1873), and Messe du Sacré Cœur (1878); Schubert’s Mass in E\r\nflat, first performance in England (1868), Song of Miriam (1869), and\r\nMass in F (1884); Benedict’s Cœur de Lion (1869); Gade’s Erl King’s\r\nDaughter (1869); Sullivan’s On Shore and Sea (1872); Macfarren’s St.\r\nJohn Baptist (1874); Smart’s Jacob (1875); Beethoven’s Choral Fantasia\r\n(1875); Astorga’s Stabat Mater (1881); Bridge’s Boadicea (1881);\r\nHodson’s Golden Legend (1884); Lloyd’s Hero and Leander (1884); and\r\nfor the first time in England, Raff’s Die Tageszeiten (1885). Mr.\r\nAlfred J. Sutton was appointed conductor at the commencement of the\r\nAssociation’s existence, and continued in office until 1877, when, upon\r\nhis resignation, Mr. Stockley, the present conductor was appointed;\r\nthe members meet weekly for practice during the winter months. The\r\nmanagement is in the hands of a Committee of fifteen members. Honorary\r\nSecretary, Mr. W. Bayley Marshall, 15, Augustus Road, Edgbaston.\r\n\r\nAMATEUR MUSICAL UNION.--The Edgbaston Amateur Musical Union was\r\nestablished in 1863, for the cultivation and encouragement of the\r\ntaste for orchestral music, and for the study and performance of\r\norchestral works by the great composers. This society has by hard work\r\nand energetic management slowly but surely made its way; at the first\r\nconcert only fifteen amateur members assisted in the band, only two\r\nof whom were among the wind department; the band now consists of 47\r\nmembers, is practically complete as to wind, and even includes drums.\r\nThe library belonging to the society now contains a very fine and\r\ncomplete collection of standard works besides a large number of pieces\r\nof a lighter character.\r\n\r\nMr. C. J. Duchemin, who took a very active part in the formation of\r\nthe society, for nineteen years acted as honorary conductor; upon his\r\nresignation in 1882, Mr. Alfred J. Sutton was appointed conductor.\r\nHonorary Secretary, Mr. R. B. Bandinelli, Pinson Villa, Fulham Road,\r\nSparkhill.\r\n\r\nPHILHARMONIC UNION.--The Birmingham Philharmonic Union was established\r\nin 1870, upon a somewhat similar basis to the Festival Choral Society,\r\nunder the conductorship of Dr. C. Swinnerton Heap. The Society has\r\ngiven annually since its formation a series of concerts, with somewhat\r\nvarying pecuniary success; and, like its companions, has introduced\r\nmany important novelties, among which are:--Bach’s St. Matthew Passion\r\nand the Christmas Oratorio, and Max Bruch’s Odysseus. The Society meets\r\nweekly for practice. The management is in the hands of a committee of\r\nnine members. Secretary: Mr. C. H. Woodward, 71, Colmore Row.\r\n\r\nMIDLAND MUSICAL SOCIETY.--The Midland Musical Society was established\r\nin 1880 by the members of the advanced singing class in connection\r\nwith the Church of the Saviour. Unlike the other musical societies of\r\nthe town, the Midland Musical Society is free, the members not paying\r\nany subscription; the free use of a rehearsal room being granted by\r\nthe Church Committee, and the conductor, Mr. H. M. Stevenson, being\r\nan honorary officer. The Society possesses a lending library of over\r\n1,000 volumes of music for the use of its members, and now consists of\r\na chorus of 240 and a well appointed amateur band. Several concerts\r\nfor charitable purposes have been given by the members, and a series\r\nof ten concerts for the working classes, in the Town Hall, to which\r\nthe admission was twopence and sixpence for floor and galleries\r\nrespectively, at one of which Gounod’s Redemption was performed. It is\r\nthe intention of the committee to continue these concerts during the\r\nensuing season. Honorary Secretary: Mr. H. M. Parker, East View, Robert\r\nRoad, Handsworth.\r\n\r\nSUNDAY SCHOOL UNION CHORAL SOCIETY.--The Birmingham Sunday School Union\r\nChoral Society was established in 1880. As its name implies, this\r\nsociety is connected with the Sunday School Union, and resulted from\r\nthe very successful annual festivals which were given by a chorus of\r\nsome 700, selected from the various schools in the union. The society\r\nmeets weekly for practice under the conductorship of Mr. Alfred R.\r\nGaul. Hon. Secretary: Mr. H. Parkes, 33, Brighton Road, Moseley.\r\n\r\nMUSICAL SOCIETY.--The Birmingham Musical Society was established in\r\n1842 upon the basis of a friendly sick and benefit society, and for\r\nthe social intercourse of music lovers and especially for the practice\r\nof glee and madrigal singing. The members meet fortnightly, and so\r\nsuccessfully have the affairs of the society been managed that the\r\ninvested funds amount to upwards of £2,000. The excellent performances\r\nof the Birmingham Glee Union, Messrs. Bickley, Woodall, Young, and\r\nStilliard, all of whom are members of the society, are well-known\r\nthroughout England. The onerous post of Musical director, which has\r\nbeen filled by many musicians of note, is now ably occupied by Mr. W.\r\nGeorge Halliley.\r\n\r\nMUSICAL ASSOCIATION.--The Birmingham Musical Association was founded\r\nin 1879 with the object of providing a series of high-class concerts\r\nat popular prices, establishing classes for musical instruction, vocal\r\nand instrumental, and the provision of a large Musical Library. Upon\r\nfurther consideration the establishment of classes and the formation\r\nof a library were abandoned. The weekly cheap concerts on Saturday\r\nnights have been continued with a few intermissions during successive\r\nwinters and have now reached a total of 159, to which the admission\r\nis threepence and sixpence for the floor and galleries respectively.\r\nA band and chorus have also been organised and have rendered material\r\nassistance at the Saturday night concerts. Honorary Secretary, Mr. H.\r\nHendriks, 25, Cannon Street.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. HARRISON’S CONCERTS.--This admirable series of subscription\r\nconcerts was established in 1870. Prior to this the present senior\r\npartner, Mr. T. Harrison, gave high class miscellaneous concerts at\r\nirregular intervals, commencing as far back as 3rd February, 1853, when\r\nthe late Mr. Weiss and Mr. Sims Reeves (who was even then spoken of\r\nas the great English Tenor), took part in the programme. In 1870, Mr.\r\nHarrison took his nephew Mr. Percy Harrison into partnership, and the\r\nannual series of subscription concerts were inaugurated, the management\r\nof which for enterprise and skill in securing all the leading artistes,\r\nvocal and instrumental, of the musical world, has made them well-known\r\nthroughout the kingdom. Besides treating their subscribers to such\r\nstars as Patti, Nilsson, Albani, Titjens, Sims Reeves, Lloyd, Santley,\r\nMaas, Norman Neruda, Sophie Menter, Charles Hallé, Pachmann, Hans von\r\nBülow, Joachim, Wilhelmi, Piatti, Bottesini, &c.; lovers of orchestral\r\nmusic have been provided for by the annual engagement of Mr. Charles\r\nHallé’s well-known band.\r\n\r\nMR. STOCKLEY’S CONCERTS.--The Subscription Orchestral Concerts were\r\ninstituted in 1873 by Mr. Stockley, the conductor of the Festival\r\nChoral Society. For the first few seasons these excellent concerts\r\nmet with but scanty support, and were carried on under serious\r\ndifficulties, and at a considerable loss; three concerts were given\r\neach season, and the band consisted of about 50 members. Mr. Stockley,\r\nhowever, steadily persevered with the good work, and met with\r\nincreasing support; in 1881, the band was augmented to its present\r\nnumber of 80, of whom no less than 76 are _bona fide_ residents in the\r\ndistrict; in the following year the number of concerts were increased\r\nto four each season; and the support now accorded is most encouraging,\r\nthe annual balance-sheet no longer showing a loss. The programmes\r\nhave always included a complete symphony at each concert, one or two\r\nclassical overtures and smaller orchestral pieces; two singers of\r\neminence have been engaged for each concert, and the vocal items as\r\nfar as possible arranged to correspond with the classical character\r\nof the instrumental. Mr. Stockley must now be congratulated upon the\r\nsuccessful result of thirteen years’ hard work, under very discouraging\r\ncircumstances at first, to popularise good orchestral music.\r\n\r\nCHAMBER CONCERTS.--Birmingham in the past has persistently refrained\r\nfrom adequately supporting chamber concerts, even when the quartette\r\nconsisted of some of the greatest living instrumentalists. Dr. C.\r\nSwinnerton Heap, with praiseworthy zeal, gives an annual series of\r\nhigh class chamber concerts, for which the subscription list is much\r\nsmaller than the excellence of the concerts should command. It is to be\r\nearnestly hoped that his labours will in the end be rewarded with the\r\nsuccess they so richly deserve.\r\n\r\nTHE CLEF CLUB.--The Clef Club was founded in 1881, to provide a central\r\nresort for the study and practice of vocal and instrumental music,\r\ncombined with the general accommodation of a Club. Monthly Smoking\r\nConcerts are held in the Club Rooms, the executants being selected from\r\namong the members, and the programmes confined to strictly “chamber\r\nmusic.” It may safely be said that since its formation the Clef Club\r\nhas done much to elevate the taste of its members, and promote the\r\nstudy and appreciation of chamber music. The success which attended\r\nthe development of the Club was so great, that greatly enlarged\r\npremises soon became necessary; and the promises of support being so\r\nencouraging, it was determined to register the Club under the Companies\r\nAct, and very greatly enlarge the original scheme. Sir Arthur Sullivan\r\nkindly accepted the post of President of the Club, and showed warm\r\ninterest in the details of the new scheme. The lease of the present\r\nclub premises in Paradise Street, close to the Town Hall, having been\r\nsecured, and the extensive alterations completed, the club entered upon\r\nits new life in July, 1885. In addition to the monthly concerts there\r\nis an impromptu smoking concert every Friday night. Honorary Secretary,\r\nMr. F. E. Huxley, Clef Club, Paradise Street.\r\n\r\nFLUTE SOCIETY.--The Birmingham Flute Society, probably the only flute\r\nsociety in England, was established in 1856 to encourage and develop\r\nthe performance of classical flute music; the Society possesses a\r\nvery fine library, consisting of all the concertante duetts, trios,\r\nand quartettes of Berbiguier, Fürstenau, Kuhlau, Kuffner, Kummer,\r\nGabrielsky, and Tulou. The members meet twice a month. Honorary\r\nSecretary, Mr. Arthur H. Hughes, 40, Chapman Road, Smallheath.\r\n\r\nMUSICAL INSTRUCTION.--There is no more important step in the\r\ndevelopment of the study of music than a thorough system of elementary\r\neducation; the Birmingham School Board, fully recognising this, in 1876\r\nmade provision for the systematic teaching of music in all the schools\r\nunder their control. Mr. W. Dobson was appointed superintendent of\r\nmusical instruction, and has formulated a very thorough system; the\r\ntonic sol-fa method is adopted and infants, if only seven years of age,\r\nare taught to sing from note correctly. One hour per week is allotted\r\nto this subject in two half-hour lessons; in addition to this two or\r\nmore classes are occasionally grouped in divisions for united rehearsal\r\nand musical drill. In addition to instruction in singing, violin and\r\nbrass band classes were commenced last winter, also on the tonic sol-fa\r\nmethod, and have been very successful. Many thousand children have thus\r\nbeen taught, by their voices being trained in connection with the ear\r\nand understanding, to sing correctly, and have been musically educated\r\nin such a way as to enable them in after years to listen intelligently\r\nand enjoy good music.\r\n\r\nSCHOOL OF MUSIC.--The School of Music in its present form at the\r\nBirmingham and Midland Institute was commenced in 1885. Classes were\r\nestablished in the following branches--theory of music, elementary and\r\nadvanced part singing and solo singing, (a separate class for each\r\nvoice, soprano, contralto, tenor and bass). The pianoforte, violin\r\n(elementary, intermediate and advanced), clarionet, flute, violoncello,\r\nand brass instruments generally. During the first term there were\r\n1,233 students in the school, the fees range from one penny per lesson\r\nto half-a-guinea for a term of 12 to 15 lessons. During the current\r\nseason the following additional classes have been sanctioned by the\r\nCouncil--organ, bassoon, oboe, double bass, and viola; and it is\r\nprobable that classes will be formed for ensemble orchestral playing\r\nand part singing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES (BIRMINGHAM AND DISTRICT.)\r\n\r\nBY C. J. WOODWARD, B.Sc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following pages an attempt is made to give to the reader some\r\nidea of the extent and variety of the manufactures of our town and\r\nneighbourhood. The method followed is to state at the outset the\r\nclasses of material which come into the town, and to follow these in\r\nthe mind’s eye through smelting furnace, forge, or workshop, until they\r\ncome out in a wonderful variety of articles, one or more of which will\r\nultimately be found in the possession of every nation of the earth. To\r\ncarry out the proposed method with fulness and accuracy would require\r\na strict blockade of the town, similar to that adopted for collecting\r\ntown dues in continental towns with agents to report the quantities\r\nand qualities of the goods passing in and out. Failing this, we may,\r\nthrough the agencies of the railway and canal companies obtain at least\r\nsome idea of the character and extent of our trade.\r\n\r\nIn preparing some statistics relating to goods brought into and\r\ntaken out of the town, I am particularly indebted to the courtesy of\r\nMr. Henry Wiggin, M.P., one of the directors of the Midland Railway,\r\nand also to Mr. John Noble, general manager of that railway; Mr. J.\r\nGrierson, general manager of the Great Western Railway; and Mr. G.\r\nFindlay, general manager of the London and North Western Railway. Mr.\r\nW. Pilcher, of the Birmingham Canal Navigations, and Mr. George, of the\r\nBirmingham and Worcester Canal, have also been good enough to supply\r\ninformation. In considering the traffic of our town we must remember\r\nthat Birmingham is not only a manufacturing centre but a distributor of\r\ngoods which arrive here in bulk. This, coupled with the circumstance\r\nthat, from its inland position, there is a great deal of through\r\ntraffic, renders it difficult to obtain such satisfactory figures as I\r\nhoped to have done when I commenced this work.\r\n\r\nStatement of principal classes of goods coming into and going out of\r\nBirmingham by railway during the year 1885, with weight in tons of each\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n           INWARDS.\r\n\r\n  Coal and Coke                 897541\r\n  Lime                            5327\r\n  Limestone, Bricks, &c.         14315\r\n  Glass                           7689\r\n  Iron and Steel                115874\r\n  Tin Plates and Zinc            10382\r\n  Spelter or Zinc                22564\r\n  Hardware and Miscellaneous    134204\r\n  Stone                          15621\r\n  Timber                         63591\r\n  Paper Making Materials          5550\r\n  Drugs and Drysaltery           14867\r\n  Grain                         126783\r\n  Grocery and Provisions         61888\r\n  Leather                         3599\r\n\r\n           OUTWARDS.\r\n  Bedsteads                      34976\r\n  Brass & Copper, Ingot and Wire  4697\r\n  Galvanised Wire and Ware       11705\r\n  Glass                           6151\r\n  Hardware and Lamps            110597\r\n  Iron and Metal Tubes           13570\r\n  Iron Wire and Sheet             2999\r\n  Iron Castings                   9166\r\n  Nails                          18936\r\n  Rolled Metal                    7619\r\n  Paper and Stationery            9490\r\n  Machinery               }\r\n  Hides and Leather       }      33754\r\n  Miscellaneous           }\r\n\r\nFrom one wharf alone in Birmingham there were delivered into the town\r\nby canal last year about 40,000 tons of various goods, of which the\r\nfollowing will serve as examples--Timber, 3810 tons; salt, 443 tons;\r\nmetals, 3948 tons; road stone, 10,821 tons; potatoes, matches, mill\r\nstones, glue and groceries, 1221 tons, whilst traffic over one of\r\nthe canals in the course of the year was 7,327,269 tons, including\r\nmerchandise, 972,749 tons; pig iron, 586,434 tons; coal, 3,333,865\r\ntons; iron stone, 495,912 tons; sand, 115,791 tons; lime and limestone,\r\n140,828 tons; road materials and manure, 525,249 tons; and bricks,\r\n460,359 tons.\r\n\r\n=Nature of the Manufacturing Industries of Birmingham and the\r\nDistrict.=--It is difficult, if not impossible to classify\r\nsatisfactorily the varied industries of Birmingham and the district.\r\nThe one adopted has as its basis, the raw materials of different kinds\r\nas used up in the trades of the town.

Lloyd, merchant, Newhall Street, sold the first small lot to W. C.\r\nAlston, about 50 years ago; since then I have sold large quantities\r\nto the manufacturers of nitric acid. _Lard oil_ was first used in\r\nBirmingham. _Carnubia wax_ (Brazil) was first used in Birmingham for\r\nwax tapers. _Mica._--The first import of large plates from India\r\nwas sold to Griffiths and Browett for lanterns to be used in powder\r\nmagazines. _Istle or Mexican Fibre._--The first bale was sold by me\r\nto Mrs. Grew, of Church street, and used for brush making. _Kourie\r\nGum_, from New Zealand, first used in Birmingham by Barratt, Postans\r\nand others for varnish making. _Cow Hair_ from River Plate used\r\nfor circular brushes in glass cutting. _Carozo nuts_ or _Vegetable\r\nIvory_.--The first arrivals from Venezuela were sold to Mr. Burgiss, of\r\nGreat Charles Street, for toys; afterwards some were obtained by Mr.\r\nBricknall, button maker, who first made buttons from this material.\r\nSubsequently the late Mr. J. S. Wright, then a clerk with Smith and\r\nKemp, took up the material, and it soon became generally used. Now\r\nsome thousands of tons are consumed every year for this purpose.\r\n_Piassava._--“I sold the first small lot to Richard Deen, and got\r\nhim to retail it to Irishmen living in London Prentice street and\r\nneighbourhood, to make into bass brooms for hawking. At the present\r\ntime some 200 tons per week of this material is made up into brooms.\r\n_Gum Animi_, largely used in Birmingham for varnish. _Button Lac_ was\r\nfirst used in Birmingham by Joseph Shorthouse, Market Street, who had\r\nthe first five cases from Calcutta, for the manufacture of lacquer.\r\n_Kiltool_, from Ceylon. The first shipment came to me, I put it aside\r\nin some stables at my house in the Coventry Road, intending to sell\r\nit for putting under ripe strawberries, but by accident I found out\r\nthat by putting it into hot oil it took a beautiful black colour. Upon\r\nthis Mr. Lovedee, of Bartholomew Street, at my suggestion, dressed and\r\nprepared the material for the brush trade. It is now used in great\r\nquantities.” _Lemon_, _Orange_, and _Citron Peel_.--Large quantities\r\nsent to Birmingham to be candied at Mr. Pattison’s works, Spring Hill.\r\nThey are imported from Sicily.\r\n\r\nThe reader having now some idea of the materials entering our district,\r\nlet us see generally, though in mere outline, how these materials are\r\nworked up in the metal trades.\r\n\r\nORES.--The only ores smelted in our district on a large scale are iron\r\nand nickel and cobalt. Small quantities of galena and copper pyrites\r\nare used. Spanish ore, an iron pyrites containing two or three per\r\ncent. of copper, has the sulphur burnt off in the chemical works, and\r\nthe copper is subsequently precipitated and refined.\r\n\r\nMETALS AND ALLOYS.--Iron and steel are now extensively produced from\r\ncast iron in our district by the modern methods as well as by the older\r\nones of puddling in the case of iron, and cementing in the case of\r\nsteel. The basic Bessemer process has been adopted on a large scale by\r\nMr. A. Hickman, of the Spring Vale Furnaces, Bilston. Three converters\r\nare used, one lined in the ordinary manner (gannister), the other\r\ntwo with a paste made of dolomite (magnesian limestone) and tar, the\r\nprocess of conversion being commenced in the first named converter,\r\nand finished in the others. At the same works are modern type blast\r\nfurnaces in which the waste gases are utilised for heating the blast\r\non the regenerative principle, two stoves being those of Mr. Cowper’s\r\nsystem, while there are three new ones invented by Ford and Moncan.\r\nMessrs. Hatton and Sons of Bilston, adopt a fixed Bessemer converter in\r\nwhich blast of low pressure can be used. At the same works the Wilson\r\ngas producer is used for re-heating furnaces, and an arrangement on\r\nthe Ponsard principle is adopted for raising the temperature of the\r\nair used in the combustion of the gas. Mr. Smith-Casson has in use\r\nat the Round Oak Works a novel gas furnace of his invention. At the\r\nPatent Shaft and Axle Tree Works a modification of the (Siemens) open\r\nhearth furnace (an improvement by Dick and Riley) is being used.[45] At\r\nMessrs. Cox Brothers and Holland, Alcester Street, crucible steel is\r\nmade. The cementing process is carried on at the Brades Steel Works,\r\nOldbury.\r\n\r\nCOPPER.--The crude copper known as Chili bars and precipitated copper\r\nfrom chemical works, where the sulphur of the ore has been previously\r\nutilized, are refined extensively in the neighbourhood of Birmingham.\r\n\r\nLEAD.--Lead refuse of various kinds, together with galena, is treated\r\nat one small works in the town.\r\n\r\nALLOYS.--In most cases manufacturers mix their own metals. However,\r\nbrass, German-silver, and other alloys are extensively manufactured for\r\nthe trade.\r\n\r\nThe metal or alloy having been made, is subject to various general\r\nprocesses, either as preliminary to manufacture, or in the course of\r\nmanufacture, of which the following are the principal:--\r\n\r\nCASTING.--From a drawing the pattern is made in wood--⅛ of an inch to\r\nthe foot longer in case of cast-iron, and ³⁄₁₆ do. in case of brass\r\nto allow for shrinking. The pattern is laid in sand, often contained\r\nin a casting frame, which, from its plasticity, non-fusibility, and\r\nother properties lends itself admirably for mould making. The mould is\r\ndusted over with charcoal, or with a mixture known as founders’ dust,\r\nand the casting then made by pouring metal in. With small articles in\r\nbrass, metal patterns are used. For gold articles, such as wedding\r\nrings, an iron frame is used, filled with the finest red sand. For\r\nsmall gold work, the cuttle fish bone is used as a mould, the pattern\r\nbeing pressed in the same manner as in sand.[46] A special feature in\r\nthe process of casting in our district is the production of “chilled”\r\ncastings for rolls. The mould for the barrel part of the roll is a\r\nheavy cylindrical casting of iron truly bored out to a size sufficient\r\nto allow of the roll being turned to the required size. The molten iron\r\nis run into the mould sidelong, and from the bottom, so as to give the\r\nmetal a rotatory motion. This rotatory motion causes the dust and slag\r\nto keep in the centre, leaving a pure metal in contact with the mould.\r\nThis metal chilled by contact with the massive metal mould, produces\r\nthe hard and close texture required.[47]\r\n\r\nKeys, stirrups, hob nails, and many small articles are produced by\r\ncasting, the casting being afterwards rendered malleable by the process\r\nof cementation, which consists in packing the articles in an iron box\r\nwith powdered hæmatite, and heating from three to seven days. Iron\r\ncastings are also annealed by packing with cinders in a box, which is\r\nthen heated for some time, as with the malleable cast iron.\r\n\r\nROLLING, WIRE AND TUBE DRAWING.--Iron, brass, steel, and German silver\r\nare used up in the form of sheet, wire, and tube. With large firms\r\nproducing finished articles, these processes are done on the premises,\r\nbut there are several works devoted to the production of sheet metal,\r\nwire, or tube only, and rolling for the trade. In the jewellers’\r\ndistrict, the cast ingots of the precious metals are taken to rolling\r\nmills in the neighbourhood to be rolled down to the required degree of\r\nfineness. For some articles, such as spoons, where a blank is required\r\nof varying thickness, strips of metal are thinned in parts by what is\r\nknown as “cross rolling,” the rolls being exposed at one end, so that a\r\nstrip of metal may be passed through, which is thus thinned down at one\r\nend.\r\n\r\nTube drawing is effected by cutting a strip of metal which is then\r\npassed through rolls to give it a gutter form. One end of the gutter\r\nis now beaten up to form a tang that can be gripped by the tongs of\r\nthe draw bench, and the gutter is pulled through a conical hole which\r\nroughly forms the tube. The open seam of the tube is now brazed, and\r\nafter cleaning, this roughly formed tube is slipped over a steel rod\r\nor mandril. Both mandril and tube are drawn through a smooth circular\r\nhole when a smooth uniform tube is formed. Fluted taper tubes are made\r\nas described at (B. p. 324[48]) by means of “tins,” but a novel method\r\nis now adopted for smooth taper tubes. A wedge-shaped piece of metal\r\nis roughly made into a conical tube which is put on a taper mandril\r\nrevolving in a lathe. A flat steel burnisher is pressed on to the tube\r\nas it revolves pressing the metal to take the shape of the mandril.\r\nTwisted tubes are produced by drawing the tube through a revolving\r\nnut (B. p. 325[48]), embossed or ornamented tubes by drawing a plain\r\ntube through a die, composed of a series, four say, of small wheels or\r\npulleys on the edge of each wheel being impressed the desired pattern.\r\nAs the tube is drawn through the die, the wheels turn and impress on\r\nthe tube the pattern they carry on their surface. As stated (B. p.\r\n326[48]), the invention is due to Mr. Fearn. It should, however, be\r\nmentioned that the process failed in his hands, but was subsequently\r\ntaken up by Messrs. Winfield and Co., who, with the help of their\r\nengineer, Mr. Thomas Preston, brought the process to perfection.\r\n\r\nPRESS TOOL WORK.--The next general process in the manufacture of many\r\nmetallic articles is cutting out a blank into the requisite shape.\r\nThis is done by what is called a press tool consisting of two parts;\r\none a firm block of steel, in which is an aperture, circular, oval, or\r\nwhatever shape may be desired, and the other a punch of corresponding\r\nshape, a piece of metal being placed over the aperture, the punch is\r\nforced down by a screw of high pitch on to the metal, when a blank is\r\ncut out at one blow, and falls into a pan placed to receive it.[49]\r\n\r\nSTAMPING.--Used for hollowing blanks in a number of trades. The blank\r\ncut by hand or tool is placed on a mould or die, and a heavy weight,\r\ncarrying on its lower surface the counterpart of the mould, working in\r\nguides so as to fall true, can be lifted up and allowed to fall on the\r\nblank until the metal is forced into the shape of the mould. As the\r\nmetal hardens by successive blows, the blanks are annealed (that is\r\nheated and allowed to cool) as often as may be found necessary.\r\n\r\nThe weight which gives the blow is supported by a strap passing over a\r\nwheel in constant motion. So long as the strap hangs loosely over the\r\nwheel, the friction of the moving wheel is insufficient to lift the\r\nweight, but immediately the workman makes the strap taut, the weight\r\nis carried up and is let fall by the workman releasing his hold on the\r\nstrap.\r\n\r\nSHAPING.--Thin metal is shaped by pressure applied by means of a\r\nscrew press, the metal being placed between a die or mould and its\r\ncounterpart.\r\n\r\nAUTOMATIC MACHINERY.--A number of articles produced from wire, such\r\nas pins, nails, hooks and eyes, hair pins, etc., are made completely\r\nby automatic machinery, the wire being wound off a reel at one end of\r\nthe machine and transformed into the various articles as it passes\r\nalong until it comes out at the other end of the machine, a finished or\r\nnearly finished article.\r\n\r\nAUTOMATIC TURNING AND SHAPING.--Gun stocks, boot lasts, tool handles\r\nand other similar articles are automatically turned. With a gun stock\r\nfor example, the rough form cut from a plank is put in a lathe, above\r\nis placed a steel model or dummy of the form required to be turned,\r\nthe model and the wooden blank are made to revolve at precisely the\r\nsame speed, and a rotating cutter travels slowly along from one end of\r\nthe blank to the other, the movement of the cutter inwards or outwards\r\nbeing regulated by the dummy. The wooden blank having been put in the\r\nlathes, the cutting is started, and it then goes on until finished,\r\nwhen the lathe stops automatically. The shaping of gun locks and many\r\nother parts of the gun is effected by causing a revolving cutter to be\r\nmoved over a fixed steel model or dummy, the cutter thus shapes the\r\nblank to a fac-simile of the pattern or dummy.[50]\r\n\r\nSPINNING.--Tea pot bodies and a variety of articles in Britannia metal\r\nare “spun.” A piece of wood 4 or 5 inches in diameter is attached to\r\nthe lathe head, and in this a hollow corresponding to the bottom of the\r\ntea pot is turned. A sheet of metal of a foot or so diameter is now put\r\nagainst the wood and pressed into the hollow by a wooden cylindrical\r\nmould with a round base which corresponds to the concavity. The disc is\r\nrotated very rapidly and the workman presses the soft metal over the\r\nmould so as to form a vessel in shape somewhat resembling a coffee cup\r\nwith upright sides, the cylindrical mould is taken out and replaced\r\nby a disc of wood in two halves, held in place by a spindle from the\r\nback centre of the lathe. The metal cylinder is now gradually closed\r\nin until the opening is reduced to the required size, when the body is\r\ncomplete. The spindle is withdrawn and the divided disc of wood easily\r\nshakes out.\r\n\r\nDRAWING THROUGH.--Umbrella ferrules, pencil cases, cartridge cases,\r\nand a variety of articles are made by “drawing through.” The finest\r\nexample of this process is seen in the manufacture of a metallic\r\ncartridge case, such as is used in the new Enfield-Martini rifle. I\r\nam indebted to Mr. T. R. Bayliss, Managing Director of the Birmingham\r\nSmall Arms and Metal Company, for the following particulars. The brass\r\nis rolled to the required thickness.[51] It is then passed into a\r\nmachine which forms it into a shallow cup. This machine consists of a\r\ntubular punch which cuts out a disc of 1.25 inch diameter, immediately\r\nupon which a solid plug passing through the tubular punch, presses the\r\ndisc through a steel ring, so that it falls to the ground as a shallow\r\nbrass cup. Three of these are produced by one blow of the press. The\r\ncups are heated in a muffle to a red heat, then dipped in dilute\r\nsulphuric acid to remove scale, washed, coated with soap and oil, and\r\nthen passed through a second machine in which a slightly narrower punch\r\nforces the cup through a slightly narrower ring, and thus the cup,\r\nwhile retaining the same thickness at the bottom, is made slightly\r\nnarrower and much deeper. Repetitions of the process (six altogether)\r\nproduce a case rather more than half-an-inch wide and three inches\r\nlong, which, when cut off to proper length, indented at the bottom for\r\nreception of the cap, and some other finishing processes gone through,\r\nis ready for the charge of powder. The process is applied to small\r\narticles like pencil cases, and at the Small Arms and Metal Company to\r\ncases as large as 5·20 inch diameter and 15 inch long.\r\n\r\nSOLDERING.--Hard soldering or brazing consists in fusing an alloy of\r\nhigh melting point between two junctions of the metal to be soldered\r\nso as firmly to connect them. The solder in fine powder is mixed with\r\npowdered borax, and made into a puddle with water, and then spread\r\nabout the parts to be soldered together. The article is now heated by\r\nfire or gas, and the moment when the solder runs, is carefully watched.\r\nGold and silver soldering used in the jewellery trades is on a small\r\nscale similar to brazing, the solder used is a gold or silver alloy of\r\nslightly lower melting point than the article to be soldered: the borax\r\nis commonly applied by previously rubbing down a crystal on a piece of\r\nslate and the white puddle thus obtained applied by means of a camel\r\nhair pencil to the junction on which the solder is placed. The article\r\nis supported on a piece of pumice stone and the necessary heat produced\r\nby the flame from a mouth blowpipe. In soft soldering an alloy of tin\r\nand lead is used, the melted alloy being spread by means of a “bit”\r\nor “doctor,” consisting of a piece of copper attached to an iron rod\r\nset in a wooden handle. A flux called “monkey” or “spirit,” consisting\r\nof muriatic acid with dissolved zinc, having previously been applied.\r\nFormerly resin was used as a flux, but this is now to a great extent\r\nsuperseded by the mixture just spoken of.\r\n\r\nSCRATCH BRUSHING is used to produce a rich rough surface previous to\r\ngilding. Revolving brushes of brass wire scratch the surface of the\r\narticle which is kept well moistened with stale beer or with water to\r\nwhich size has been added.\r\n\r\nOf late years the SAND BLAST has been introduced for roughing surfaces.\r\nSand is fed into a powerful blast of air, and a fine frosted surface\r\nproduced. If the article is protected in places by a mask of paper\r\nor soft metal cut out in any desired pattern, an ornamental pattern\r\nis produced requiring only a little chasing to finish it. The sand\r\nblast is used too in the production of an imitation of engraved glass,\r\nin embossing glass as a substitute for hydrofluoric acid, and for\r\nre-cutting old files.\r\n\r\nDIPPING.--In order to clean brass articles, they are dipped into a\r\nmixture of nitric and sulphuric acids, the temperature and strength\r\nof acid determining whether the dipping is bright or dead. The bright\r\narticles are now finished by burnishing or polishing, and are then\r\nready for\r\n\r\nLACQUERING.--The articles are laid on an iron table heated to a\r\ntemperature of about 230° F. by super-heated steam. When warm, the\r\nlacquer, which is a solution of shell-lac in spirits of wine, is\r\nbrushed over, the spirit evaporates and leaves a protecting coating of\r\ngum.\r\n\r\nGOLD CUTTING or LAPPING in jewellery consists in pressing articles\r\nagainst a rapidly revolving disc or “lap,” composed of lead and tin,\r\nto the surface of which fine emery has been applied. The faces of\r\nthe article which have thus been “cut” are subsequently polished\r\non a “bob,” that is on a wheel covered with leather on its edge or\r\ncircumference.[52]\r\n\r\nCOLOURING in jewellery refers to a rich gold colour obtained on gold\r\narticles. The process at first could be applied only to jewellery of\r\nhigh quality, but now 15 and 18 carat gold is coloured. The articles\r\nare heated to dull redness to destroy grease and dirt, then hung on\r\nplatinum wires and immersed in a boiling mixture of salt, saltpetre,\r\nand muriatic acid and water. After drying out in sawdust they are\r\nscratch-brushed.[52]\r\n\r\nThere are many extremely interesting processes in the trades of our\r\ntown besides those which apply exclusively to the metal trades, but for\r\nthese I have no space. Those who wish for full information respecting\r\nthe history, position, and general character of the Birmingham\r\nindustries, must consult “Birmingham and the Midland Hardware\r\nDistrict,” edited by Mr. Sam. Timmins. This volume, which was published\r\non the occasion of the visit of the British Association to the town\r\nin 1865, is exhaustive, describing the trades as they then existed.\r\nIn order, however, to supplement Mr. Timmins’ book, application has\r\nbeen made to various gentlemen who have been good enough to provide\r\nthe following short notices (or the substance of them) of the various\r\ntrades referred to at length in the volume. In addition there are some\r\nnotices of industries which have been introduced since the year 1865.\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY DETAILS OF BIRMINGHAM TRADE SINCE 1865.\r\n\r\n=Introductory Note.=--The references to “Birmingham and the Midland\r\nHardware District” volume are quoted as “B.,” followed by a number\r\nindicating the page. Thus (B. 77) means, _See “Birmingham and the\r\nMidland Hardware District”, page 77_. The trades are arranged\r\nalphabetically.\r\n\r\n=Assay Office of Birmingham.=--[H. WESTWOOD].--(B. 499). The assay\r\nmarks continue to be so highly valued by the public that all goods\r\nare now sent to be assayed and marked except those of the commonest\r\nquality, and a few richly wrought articles that would be injured in the\r\nprocess.[53]\r\n\r\nThe statistics of the Assay Office form an index to the condition of\r\nthe gold and silver trades of the town. The following tables are a\r\ncontinuation of those given by Mr. Ryland (B. 507).\r\n\r\nWEIGHT OF GOLD AND SILVER WARES ASSAYED AND MARKED IN BIRMINGHAM.\r\n\r\n  Year ends     Gold.

BRIERLEY.]--(B. 624.) In 1849 there\r\nwere only about eight manufacturers of metallic bedsteads in Birmingham\r\nand the neighbourhood, whose united production probably reached 400\r\nfinished articles per week. In 1865 the number had increased to twenty,\r\nwith a weekly output of about 5,000; the number of makers within a\r\nradius of fifteen miles is about forty, and the weekly production not\r\nfar short of 20,000. As the number of manufacturers increased, and\r\ncompetition necessarily became keener, so improvements were continually\r\nbeing effected. The old imitation bamboo cane gave way to more artistic\r\neffects of colour. The pillars and rails were decorated with flowers\r\nand Dutch metal, or with gold--accomplished partly by hand, and partly\r\nby the process (long known in the potteries for ornamenting china ware)\r\ncalled transferring. This somewhat pronounced, if not “loud” style of\r\ndecoration, though still in demand for foreign countries, has in its\r\nturn been replaced by plain polished surfaces, relieved at intervals\r\nwith brass, nickel, or silver plated joints, and mountings. Prices\r\nrange now (1886) from 5/- or 6/- for a plain stump bedstead to £100 for\r\nelectro-silver plated canopy or fore part constructed to suit Oriental\r\ntaste. The United States now buys and also makes metallic bedsteads.\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, the Cape, Mauritius, Canada, East and West\r\nIndies, the States of South America, Egypt, China, and to some extent,\r\nJapan, purchase.\r\n\r\nAbout 500 persons are now employed in Birmingham and neighbourhood in\r\nthe bedstead trade; the average earnings of men are about 23/- per\r\nweek, and of women about 14/- per week.\r\n\r\nWithin the last ten years wire mattresses have been introduced. The\r\nprice was formerly £4 to £5 for a mattress, according to width. Now a\r\ngood one may be obtained at a price varying from 20/- to 40/-.\r\n\r\nWhile Birmingham and the district is the principal seat of the bedstead\r\ntrade there are extensive manufactories in London, Manchester, Glasgow,\r\nand Bristol. Metallic bedsteads are also made extensively in France,\r\nSpain, Italy, Germany, and of late years in the United States also.\r\nA great number are, however, still exported to Spain and America in\r\nspite of the native competition, and protective duties amounting to\r\n45 per cent. Our trade with Spain is very much reduced of late years\r\nin consequence of England being denied the advantage of “the favoured\r\nnation” clause.\r\n\r\n=Block Paper and its Uses.=--[J. B. GAUSBY.]--(B. 574.) Since the\r\nprevious paper on this subject was written, there has been no\r\nalteration in the process of manufacture, nor has there been any\r\nmarked development of the trade as a whole. The manufacture of panels\r\nof various thickness has increased in consequence of their adoption\r\nin the place of wood, where bending or exposure to varying conditions\r\nof moisture are required. The great quantities of trays imported\r\nfrom Japan for some time checked the demand for moulded paper tray\r\nblanks, but the demand is now returning. Fashion has however dealt\r\nless kindly with the manufacture of slabs in blocks for the purpose of\r\nmanufacturing artificial jet ornaments. This branch of the trade is\r\nentirely destroyed.\r\n\r\n=Boiler Plate and Gas Holders.=--[W. S. SUTHERLAND.]--(B. 93.) In\r\nspite of heavy duties, boiler and gas apparatus are still exported.\r\nWithin the last twenty years many types of tubular boilers have\r\nbeen introduced, but the one fluted or Cornish boiler, the simple\r\negg-end, and the Lancashire and double boiler with cross tubes are\r\nmost generally used. Mild steel has been introduced into boiler making\r\nand plate making during the last few years, though it is still a\r\ncontested point whether it is superior to iron when all things are\r\ntaken into consideration. It requires to have all rivet holes drilled,\r\nand it must be carefully annealed, though the writer is informed by\r\nMr. Edwin Danks, of Oldbury, that steel makers often prefer to have\r\ntheir plates either worked cold or at a red heat, and not in the\r\nintermediate condition. Drilling machines especially designed are now\r\nused. Hydraulic machines of greatly improved construction have come\r\ninto use for facilitating the operations in the boiler yard. These\r\nmachines are portable, the water being supplied through a flexible\r\ntube. Improvements in the construction of the internal boiler flues\r\nhave been made to enable them to resist increased pressure, and further\r\nto allow the expansion and contraction of the flue without injury. Of\r\nthese improvements, the most noted are Fox’s corrugated flues, the\r\nbowling ring, the flanged flue, and Arnold’s flue.\r\n\r\nAn improvement introduced by the writer into boiler plate working,\r\nis the system of welding by gas, adopted in Birmingham by Messrs.\r\nPiggott, and by Messrs. Lloyd and Lloyd, for tubular and other work\r\nand applied by Mr. Puplett for welding plate sheets of steel only, 12\r\nand 13 w.g. thick into ice moulds. It is found that the strength of\r\nthe weld equals that of the solid plate, and the process is a cleanly\r\nand convenient one. Hemispherical sugar pans of 8 and 9 feet diameter\r\nwithout a joint are made by Messrs. Piggott, who use this process. _Gas\r\nHolders._--Since 1865 much larger gas holders have been made. The two\r\ndesigned by Mr. Hunt, and recently erected at the Windsor Street Works,\r\nBirmingham, have each a capacity of 6,000,000 cubic feet, and are at\r\nthe present time the largest in the world.\r\n\r\n=Brassfoundry.=--(B. 225). No important changes have taken place in\r\nthis trade since the last report was written. At Messrs. Winfield’s and\r\nother makers, light and elegant “electroliers,” for electric lighting,\r\nhave been added to the usual run of work. A general cheapening of brass\r\narticles has resulted among other causes from the reduction in price of\r\ncopper. In the table (B. 259) it will be seen that in 1855 copper was\r\n£126 a ton, the prices since 1865, when it was £92, have been--\r\n\r\n         £\r\n  1866   88\r\n  1867   78\r\n  1868   76\r\n  1869   75\r\n  1870   70\r\n  1871   75\r\n  1872   96\r\n  1873   92\r\n  1874   87\r\n  1875   88\r\n  1876   82\r\n  1877   75\r\n  1878   67\r\n  1879   63\r\n  1880   67\r\n  1881   66\r\n  1882   72\r\n  1883   67\r\n  1884   59\r\n  1885   48\r\n\r\nThe increased imports from America account for the fall in price, the\r\nincrease in Lake Superior copper alone being from 25,439 tons in 1882,\r\nto 35,000 in 1885.[54]\r\n\r\n=Button Trade.=--[J. P. TURNER.]--(B. 432.) A fashion for covered\r\nbuttons in various qualities of mohair or its imitations, in diagonal\r\npatterns, has prevailed at home and abroad for some years. These are\r\nlargely made in Birmingham, but as many or more are imported from\r\nGermany, where the covering is _wholly_ produced, and, further, a\r\nbetter finish to the buttons is obtained. _Vegetable Ivory or Carozo\r\nNut Buttons._--The Germans produce more beautiful designs and superior\r\nfinish at the same prices, and the Birmingham markets are now almost\r\nannihilated. The foreign trade Birmingham once had is extinguished.\r\n_Pearl Buttons._--Since 1865 a new supply of pearl shell has been\r\nobtained from various parts of the coast round Australia, and this\r\nlocality is our chief source of supply. It is worth £200 per ton for\r\npicked parcels, and about £150 per ton when delivered here. The best of\r\nthis shell is equal or nearly so to the best Macassar shells. Panama\r\nshells are now found in but small quantities, and instead of only\r\nfetching £20 to £30 per ton, as quoted in 1865, they are now worth £50\r\nto £70. _Glass Buttons._--Some fancy glass buttons made in Birmingham\r\nare still unsurpassed in style, but the sale is a limited one. More\r\nthan ever come from Bohemia, where they are better made than formerly,\r\nand equally low in price.\r\n\r\nThe button trade in Paris has had to yield to German competition\r\nequally with that in England.[55]\r\n\r\n=Cast Iron and Hollow Ware.=--[W. KENRICK, M.P.]--(B. 103.) Since\r\n1866 the increase in the trade is remarkable, and some important\r\nimprovements have been introduced by which the public has obtained\r\na very superior article, at a price quite as low, if not lower than\r\nbefore. Roughly speaking, the trade has doubled in twenty years.\r\nEnamelled iron ware has become better known and more appreciated.\r\nTen firms are now engaged in this manufacture. Messrs. Baldwin, of\r\nStourport, have introduced and patented a new process, whereby they\r\nclaim the production of a better enamel at a lower price, owing to the\r\nuse of a single coat. This variety is called mottled enamel ware.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Kenrick were the first in the trade to introduce a cover\r\nstamped out of a single piece of metal without rivet or seam, and this\r\nwas manufactured under a patent taken out by Mr. Ryland in 1868. Since\r\nthen the adoption of a solid cover has extended generally throughout\r\nthe trade. By another patent, the firm fixed the tubular handle to the\r\nsaucepan by means of a socket in which the tube was securely locked\r\nwithout a rivet.\r\n\r\nThe process of annealing has been improved by a saving of time\r\noccupied in the process. Machinery has been introduced into the\r\nmoulding of hollow-ware, the stamping and finishing of covers, and the\r\ndressing of hinges and sash pulleys.\r\n\r\nThe odd work which comprises most small articles of cast iron used by\r\nbuilders’ furnishers, &c., has undergone a great change in appearance,\r\nowing to the introduction of a new style of finish from America. A\r\ncoat of transparent varnish is now applied, the iron being previously\r\npolished on those parts in relief, and the result is an appearance\r\nsomewhat resembling antique bronze. This, together with greater\r\nlightness and elegance of design, has given an impetus to the trade,\r\nand has led to the introduction of iron where brass was previously used.\r\n\r\nThe favourable conditions of labour described in 1866 still prevail,\r\nthough it may be added that progress in this direction has at least\r\nkept pace with the advance in progress of manufacture, and the greater\r\nexcellence in the ware produced.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the Factory Acts have long applied to this industry\r\nwith beneficial results. The hours of labour have been reduced, and\r\nthanks to the Education Act of 1870, the intelligence and docility\r\nof the younger operatives are their notable characteristics. What is\r\nnow wanted is the establishment of Science and Art classes where the\r\nprinciples which underlie processes may be learnt, and the power to\r\nadd beauty of form to articles of utility may be acquired. When these\r\nbranches of technical training are added to the course of elementary\r\ninstruction in our public Schools, all that is needed to secure the\r\nprosperity of British industry will have been done.\r\n\r\nThe best relations as a rule now exist between employers and employed;\r\nthe former are less exacting and more sympathetic, the latter take\r\njuster views of the relation of capital and labour, and are more\r\nready to co-operate with their employers to a common end. The wider\r\nintroduction of machinery has been attended with the larger employment\r\nof female labour, and this seems to be an inevitable tendency of modern\r\nprocesses of manufacture. On the other hand many more skilled workmen\r\nare required in the fitting and machine shops, which now form an\r\nimportant department in large works of the class here described.\r\n\r\n=Clocks.=--Within the last year or two a new industry has been imported\r\ninto the town by Mr. Edward Davies, formerly of the Ansonia Clock\r\nCompany, Brooklyn. A company has been formed under the name of the\r\nBritish United Clock Company, of 34, Farringdon Road, London. The works\r\nare in Great Hampton Street, Birmingham. The company make the round or\r\ndrum-like time pieces, the works of which are machine-made, the parts\r\nbeing interchangeable, and are supplied retail at a few shillings each.\r\n\r\n=Coinage.=--[RALPH HEATON].--(B. 552). Coining presses devised by\r\na German named Uhlhorn, but manufactured and improved by Messrs.\r\nHeaton, have been supplied to the Royal Mint. The great advantage of\r\nthe new presses is that they require no foundation, and are silent\r\nand automatic in action. The blanks are dropped into a tube, and the\r\nmachine carries them forward one by one to the dies, where they are\r\nfinished and fall into a box in front of the workman.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the manufacture of blanks, Birmingham has from time to\r\ntime furnished these to a number of States, and is doing so now. Nickel\r\ncoinage (an alloy of 20 per cent. nickel, and 80 per cent. copper) has\r\nbeen supplied to Jamaica in pence, half pence, and farthings. In 1884,\r\nseventy-five tons nickel alloy were coined for Servia, and an entirely\r\nnew coinage of both silver and nickel for the Republic of Ecuador. At\r\nthe present time (1886) Messrs. Heaton are supplying Columbia and Egypt\r\nwith nickel coinage. The nickel alloy is an excellent material for\r\ncoinage.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 the Birmingham Mint delivered silver blanks to the Royal Mint,\r\nfor a coinage of the nominal value of £1,000,000. This was completed in\r\nsix months.\r\n\r\nThe letter H below the date will be found on many of the bronze\r\ncoins in circulation; this implies that the coins were struck at the\r\nBirmingham Mint. At the time of their introduction in 1875, it was\r\nsupposed that an extensive gang of forgers were at work, and the mint\r\nauthorities were communicated with by an anonymous writer, who stated\r\nthat the counterfeit coins could be distinguished by the small letter H\r\nbelow the date.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Heaton have supplied coins to no less than 39 states or\r\nauthorities. In 1868, the Italian Government ordered five million lire\r\nin pieces of 10 centimes; and in consideration of the satisfactory\r\nmanner in which this and other coinages had been carried out, his\r\nmajesty, King Victor Emmanuel, conferred the honour of knighthood on\r\nthe firm.\r\n\r\n=Electric Lighting.=--[HENRY LEA, M.I.M.E.]--The period of fifteen\r\nyears following the last Meeting of the British Association in\r\nBirmingham, in the year 1865, was devoid of any undertakings in\r\nelectric lighting, other than in the direction of the application of\r\npowerful arc lights for lighthouse purposes, as practised by Messrs.\r\nChance Bros., of Spon Lane, near Birmingham, who, beginning in 1862\r\nwith apparatus having optical adjustments for electric arc lights of\r\nsmall power, proceeded to introduce more and more powerful lights, of\r\nwhich the Souter Point revolving light of the 2nd and 3rd order built\r\nin 1870, the South Forelands fixed lights, two in number, and of the\r\n3rd order, built in the same year; the Sydney Heads light of the 1st\r\norder and of 11,000 candle power, built in 1880; and the flashing light\r\nat Tino, near Spezia, a lamp of the 2nd order, finished in 1885, are\r\nexamples shewing the great progress made during the period referred to.\r\nThe Sydney Heads light is said to be the leading light of the world.\r\nThe motive power employed for it is the Otto silent gas engine. The\r\ncarbons are 23 millimetres, or upwards of ⅞″ in dia. Particulars of\r\nthese undertakings will be found in a special paper upon Lighthouse\r\nWork in another part of this volume. The first application of arc\r\nlighting for ordinary business purposes in this district is believed\r\nto be that of the Birmingham Household Supply Association Limited,\r\nwhich was fixed in the year 1880-1 under the superintendence of the\r\nwriter, who employed a pair of 8″ × 12″ Horizontal Tangye Engines to\r\ndrive a Brush Dynamo working sixteen arc lamps. Amongst other examples\r\nof arc lighting subsequently put down may be named those at Messrs.\r\nBrown Marshalls & Co.’s Carriage Works at Saltley, Messrs. John Wilkes\r\nand Sons’ Rolling Mills in Liverpool Street, Messrs. Elkington & Co.’s\r\nShow Rooms, in Newhall Street, the New British Iron Co.’s Works at\r\nCorngreaves, the Lower Grounds at Aston Park, and Messrs. Cadbury\r\nBros.’ Cocoa Manufactory, near Birmingham, the latter being only very\r\nrecently started upon the Gulcher system.\r\n\r\nThe incandescent or glow electric lamp, first made its appearance upon\r\na large scale in Birmingham, in the year 1882, when the Birmingham Town\r\nHall was successfully illuminated for the Triennial Musical Festival,\r\nby Messrs. R. W. Winfield and Co., who had allied themselves with\r\nMessrs. R. E. Crompton and Co., of Chelmsford, for electric lighting\r\nundertakings. This installation was established under the writer’s\r\nsuperintendence, and consisted of 440 Swan glow lamps, suspended from\r\nornamental pendants placed around the walls of the Hall, a chamber\r\nhaving very nearly the proportions of a double cube, and measuring\r\n165ft. × 65ft. × 65ft. high. Various lamps in other rooms raised the\r\nnumber to 500. Cables were laid underneath the streets, for a distance\r\nof about a quarter of a mile, to the works of Messrs. Winfield and Co.,\r\nin Cambridge street, where nine Bürgin Dynamos, separately excited by\r\ntwo similar machines, were employed to generate the electricity, the\r\nmotive power being the old rolling mill engine, from the flywheel of\r\nwhich a belt conveyed the motion to the electric machinery. This wheel,\r\nbeing 25ft. diameter, weighing about 25 tons, and revolving 50 times\r\nper minute, afforded a source of motion, the steadiness of which left\r\nnothing to be desired. The marked difference of temperature in the Town\r\nHall during the evening performances, as compared with the previous use\r\nof gas--70° at the ceiling instead of 110°--was fully appreciated by\r\nthe large audiences of that festival. Subsequently the number of lamps\r\nwas increased to upwards of 600, by the addition of two pendants. The\r\nsame means of illumination were used for the 1885 Triennial Festival,\r\nas well as on many occasions of concerts, etc. The whole plant still\r\nremains the property of Messrs. Winfield and Co. Upon somewhat similar\r\nlines the same firm fitted up the Leeds Town Hall, for the Festival of\r\n1883, where, however, the whole of the light was derived from pendants\r\nsuspended from the ceiling by steel wire ropes. The machinery in this\r\ncase was also situated about a quarter of a mile from the Town Hall.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1882, Messrs. Elwell, Parker, and Co., commenced\r\nelectrical business in Wolverhampton, with secondary or storage\r\nbatteries constructed upon a modification of the Planté method of\r\nmanufacture. Shortly afterwards, the same firm began to make dynamos\r\nfor charging their batteries, since which time the output has\r\nincreased, and now amounts to a total of about 500 dynamos, besides\r\nseveral thousands of storage cells, the latter being now made under\r\nthe joint Patents of the Wolverhampton Firm, and the Electrical Power\r\nStorage Co., Limited, of London. The London Stock Exchange, Lloyd’s\r\nShipping Offices, the Manchester Art Gallery, Lord Shrewsbury’s seat at\r\nIngestre Hall, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co., the Blackpool\r\nElectric Tramway, the Giants’ Causeway Electric Tramway, the Cannock\r\nChase Colliery, the Grosvenor Gallery and many other establishments are\r\nlighted or worked by means of dynamos manufactured by the Wolverhampton\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\nAmongst installations set up in Birmingham under the writer’s\r\nsuperintendence may be mentioned the Theatre Royal, in New Street,\r\nand the Prince of Wales Theatre, in Broad Street, in each of which\r\nthe plant consists of a 16-H.P. Otto silent gas engine, driving a 300\r\nlight Ferranti alternate current dynamo with a Siemen’s exciter, and\r\nwith appliances at the prompt side for lowering or turning out the\r\nlight at will. 200 lights are run very brightly with an expenditure\r\nof about 800 cubic feet of gas per hour. A similar number of ordinary\r\ngas burners would require from 1,000 to 1,200 cubic feet of gas per\r\nhour. The Birmingham Liberal Club, in Congreve Street, another example,\r\nhas 160 lamps which are worked from a 10-unit compound dynamo, made\r\nby Messrs. Crompton and Co., of Chelmsford, the motive power being a\r\n12-H.P. compound steam engine, by Messrs. Marshall, Sons, and Co.,\r\nLimited, of Gainsborough. This machine is an excellent specimen of a\r\nself-regulating dynamo, the commutator not having been touched with\r\nanything coarser than well-worn emery cloth since February last, its\r\nsurface presenting a highly-polished appearance. No storage cells are\r\nused, the lighting being derived directly from the machine.\r\n\r\nIn the suburbs, the house of Mr. Mitchell, Hagley Road, Edgbaston, has\r\nabout 40 lights, and is worked from a 2-H.P. Otto silent gas engine,\r\nand a 2-unit Crompton shunt-wound dynamo, charging 24 storage cells of\r\nthe E.P.S. (Electrical Power Storage Co.’s) type.\r\n\r\nThe writer’s house, 7, Clarendon Road, Edgbaston, is also electrically\r\nlighted by 24 E.P.S. cells, charged by a 30-light Chamberlain & Hookham\r\ndynamo, worked from a ½-H.P. Otto gas engine.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Chamberlain & Hookham began, a few years ago, the manufacture\r\nof dynamos having permanent steel magnets, but they subsequently\r\nadopted the more usual type of electro-magnetic machines. Particulars\r\nare not to hand of this firm’s work, but the residences of Messrs.\r\nWalter Chamberlain and Herbert Chamberlain are amongst the examples of\r\ndomestic electric lighting carried out by the firm, whose attention,\r\nhowever, has been directed principally to the manufacture of dynamos\r\nfor electro-depositing purposes, where very heavy currents of low\r\nelectro-motive force are required.\r\n\r\nThe public supply of electricity was in 1882-3 the subject of much\r\nattention on the part of Messrs. Winfield & Crompton, under whose\r\nauspices the Incandescent Electric Lighting Co. Ld. was registered. An\r\nAct of Parliament was obtained, and plans and estimates were made by\r\nthe writer for lighting a large district in Birmingham from central\r\nstations. Carefully collected statistics of the gas consumption in the\r\nproposed district afforded some interesting information, such as, for\r\ninstance, that the average cost of gas per burner per annum, called\r\nthe burner earnings, varied from 2d. to 43/6 per burner per annum, and\r\nshowed a mean earning for the whole district of 10/2 per burner per\r\nannum, the average price of gas being about 2/3 per 1,000 cubic feet.\r\nFrom various causes, chief amongst them being the adverse restrictions\r\nof the Electric Lighting Act of 1882, the operations of the Company\r\nhave remained in abeyance. The Birmingham Act is, however, still in\r\nforce, and should the efforts which are now being made for the removal\r\nor substantial modification of the obnoxious clauses of the Act meet\r\nwith the desired success, Birmingham may yet enjoy the advantages of\r\na public supply of electric light, the luxury of which only those who\r\nhave lived in an electrically lighted house can fully appreciate.\r\n\r\n=Flint Glass Manufacture of Birmingham.=--[A. C. OSLER.]--(B. 526.)\r\nFurther inventions have been made with regard to furnaces. Frisby’s\r\npatent, the fuel inserted from below, instead of being thrown on the\r\ntop of the fire, has met with some amount of favour, having been\r\nadopted by several Stourbridge houses. Bœtius’s patent, by which the\r\nearlier stages of combustion take place below the floor of the furnace,\r\nand a current of heated air is supplied to complete the combustion as\r\nthe inflammable gases pass through an opening in its floor into the\r\nfurnace itself, has now been in use at Messrs. Osler’s for many years.\r\n\r\nThe process of etching by hydrofluoric acid, has been largely developed\r\nas a means of ornamenting glass, and has to a large extent superseded\r\nengraving. Highly artistic designs are produced by a combination of\r\netching and engraving. Mechanical methods are adopted in producing many\r\neffective borders.\r\n\r\nAmong new inventions for the ornamentation of glass, should be\r\nmentioned the process of “threading,” that is, the surrounding and\r\npartial covering of a body of glass of one colour with a continuous\r\nthread of glass of another colour, by which many beautiful effects of\r\nvarying and toned colour are produced.\r\n\r\nRecent years have also seen the revival of what is termed cameo\r\ncutting on glass. A body of glass being formed of layers of different\r\ncolours, the outer layer or layers are partially removed by eating away\r\nby hydrofluoric acid, and the remaining portions are then wrought into\r\ndesigns with the chisel or graver. A reproduction of the Portland Vase\r\nis one of the most remarkable specimens of this revived art, which\r\noffers excellent opportunity for the combination of lustrous colours of\r\nvaried hue with delicate and exquisite ornamentation.\r\n\r\nMarked progress has been made in the production of coloured glass,\r\nformerly almost a monopoly of the Bohemian makers.\r\n\r\n=Hinges of Wrought Iron.=--[F. E. MARTINEAU.]--(B. 610.) Material\r\nconsumed at time of British Association Meeting, in 1849, was about 700\r\ntons; in 1865, about 2,500 tons, and this year, 1886, about 3,500 tons\r\nper annum. In 1865, about 300 people were employed in the trade, there\r\nare now about 380. Strip steel has to a certain extent replaced strip\r\niron in the manufacture.\r\n\r\n=Hydraulic Machinery.=--[MESSRS. TANGYE.]--(B. 647.) The Cornwall\r\nWorks have rapidly extended, now occupying six times the area covered\r\nin 1865. 2,000 men are employed. In addition to hydraulic machinery,\r\nsteam engines, machine tools, machinery for gas works, patent retort\r\nlids, gas stoking and charging machines, gas engines of a novel and\r\neconomical type, steam boilers of all kinds, and fixed and portable\r\nsteam cranes are manufactured. These works will now turn out per month\r\n200 steam pumping engines, 40 steam boilers, 100 steam engines used for\r\nother purposes than pumping, 800 cranes, crabs, and lifting apparatus.\r\n300 hydraulic presses, lifts, and jacks. 5,000 complete sets of pulley\r\nblocks, and 1,000 gas retort mouth-pieces and lids.\r\n\r\n=Jewellery.=--[JOHN BRAGG.] (B. 452).--EXTENT OF THE TRADE.--This\r\ngeneral title includes a number of so called “Trades” which appear in\r\nthe Directory under separate heads. It covers not only gold and silver\r\n“Jewellers,” but gold and silver chain makers, gilt, plated, and black\r\nornament jewellers, as well as all those subsidiary branches which\r\nexist solely for the general trade, such for instance as lapidaries,\r\nstone dealers, gold cutters, chasers, engravers, jewellers’ die\r\nsinkers, tool makers and stampers, enamellers, case makers, and also\r\njewellery factors. In several large establishments, many of these\r\nseparate departments are carried on within the walls and under one\r\ncentral management. The Post Office Directory for 1885 gives 1,123\r\nmaster-men thus engaged in Birmingham. To these however must be added\r\na large number of “garret” masters or “out workers” whose names do\r\nnot so appear, and who employ perhaps only one, two, or three persons\r\neach. It is estimated that 14,000 to 16,000 persons are actively\r\nemployed in this trade in Birmingham, while probably 40,000 to 50,000\r\nare locally dependent upon it. The amount of capital here engaged in\r\nit is enormous, and, without doubt, larger than any other distinct\r\nand separate trade of the town. The manufacture is still, as at\r\nlast report, aggregated in one locality, though it is extending its\r\narea. The central point is near to where Warstone Lane is crossed by\r\nNorthampton Street or Vyse Street.\r\n\r\nLABOUR AND WAGES.--The increase of female labour, particularly in\r\nsilver jewellery and in warehouse duties, is very considerable, and\r\nhas tended to keep down the wages of men. Still, these have risen to\r\nvery high points in seasons of prosperity, and even in the present\r\ntime of depressed prices, a skilled journeyman jeweller earns with his\r\nown hands 30s. to 45s. per week of about 54 hours. A trade society\r\nexists, but nothing approaching to a “strike” is possible, because of\r\nthe infinite variety of departments, the constant change of patterns,\r\nand the habit of each workman agreeing personally with his employer or\r\nforeman as to prices of piece work. Most of the manufactories are well\r\nventilated, the newly built ones being large and commodious in every\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nBULLION USED.--An estimate has been made by those most competent\r\nto judge as to the value of gold and silver used by this trade in\r\nBirmingham per annum. Taking the last three or four years as a basis,\r\nit seems probable that the annual consumption of gold here is about\r\n£750,000, and of silver (at the present low price) from £300,000 to\r\n£350,000. One large manufacturer of silver jewellery has, within the\r\nlast three years, used upwards of 3,000 oz. of fine silver per week.\r\nSovereigns are still extensively used to melt instead of grain gold.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, “Why melt sovereigns when gold, commercially pure, can\r\nbe had from the dealers without paying costs of minting?” The answer\r\nis: the cost of minting is so small that against the other advantages\r\nattaching to the practice, it is of no account. These advantages\r\nare--1st, the grain gold of commerce cannot be relied upon for absolute\r\nfreedom from accidental or superfluous alloy; and 2nd, that other\r\nqualities, such as uniform hardness, tenacity, and ductility--of the\r\nutmost importance to some branches of the trade--are ensured by using\r\nthem. The metallurgical science and technical skill of our national\r\nassayers and melters at the mint, are therefore freely used by our\r\nmanufacturers to enable them to alloy to the utmost nicety, and yet\r\nwith a certainty of their goods, when made, passing the “Hall.” This,\r\ntherefore, is a question of economy.\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN THE TRADE.--The immensely increased production of silver\r\njewellery has tended to almost obliterate two departments which\r\ntwenty-five years ago were of large proportions--viz., the gilt and\r\nthe plated jewellery trades. The workmen in these branches have mostly\r\nturned their hands to silver working. Notice must be taken of some new\r\ndevelopments, which have become practically new trades to the town.\r\nThe manufacture of costly official insignia, such as mayoral chains,\r\nmunicipal badges, presentation caskets, gold and silver ceremonial\r\nkeys, &c., is new since last report. More than seventy such mayoral\r\nchains have been made here since then. The manufacture of watch cases\r\nin gold and silver, but particularly in silver, is also a new and\r\nvery considerable trade, employing hundreds of people. Not fewer than\r\n60,000 to 80,000 silver watch cases per annum are now turned out from\r\nBirmingham manufactories. Another new trade, though at present not a\r\nlarge one, is diamond cutting, but there is no reason why it should not\r\nbecome an important business here.\r\n\r\nARTISTIC PROGRESS.--How far the trade has led or has followed public\r\ntaste it is impossible to say, but that a general improvement has\r\ntaken place is undeniable. In place of the huge bracelets, brooches,\r\nearrings, and lockets of twenty years ago, we now have small and\r\nelegant articles of the most tasteful designs. Even such jewellery as\r\nis produced greatly by the aid of machinery, for the sake of cheapness,\r\nis often characterised by perfect style. Silver brooches may be bought\r\nwholesale for one shilling each which would not disgrace any wearer of\r\nthe most refined taste. In the gold trade also, the productions for the\r\ngreat middle classes are equally neat and commendable, both as to form\r\nand detail of decoration. The greater use of gems, both in gold and\r\nsilver jewellery, is a distinct feature of present requirements. A most\r\nremarkable evidence of the above statements is afforded by one branch\r\nof the trade, which now exports to France, Germany, and Switzerland\r\ngoods in large and increasing quantities, winning its way by style as\r\nwell as price against the best makers of the Continent. Compared with\r\nthe like classes and prices of goods twenty years ago, there is no\r\ndoubt but that beauty of design is greatly improved; nor can there be a\r\ndoubt either but that our National Art Teaching has chiefly contributed\r\nto the improvement.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY.--Chemistry has considerably improved the various processes\r\nin which its aid can be applied. Alloying is more skilfully and exactly\r\nperformed. The art of melting is better understood. “Coloring” (which\r\nmust not be confounded with “gilding”) is now carried to a pitch of\r\nremarkable excellence. At date of last report, this, which is a purely\r\nchemical process, was done without much intelligence, and nothing lower\r\nthan 15 carat gold could be with certainty so finished. But now those\r\nwho devote themselves specially to this branch of work, can produce\r\na beautiful “color” on 12 carat gold. It must, however, be stated,\r\nthat upon the lower quality, such bloom and rich colour is fugitive,\r\nwhile upon the higher qualities it is permanent. Gilding by electric\r\nprocesses is done with increased economy and skill. Parcel gilding,\r\noxydising, and gilding with various colored alloys in solution, are\r\ncarried to a high pitch of excellence. The chemical treatment of waste,\r\nsuch as shop sweepings, and the water used for washing of hands is much\r\nimproved. In the business of refining, scarcely anything is lost.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL CONDITIONS.--So much depends, and will always depend upon\r\nskilled handicraft in the Jewellery trades, that there is not much to\r\nrecord in the way of mechanical progress. Still, in some tools there\r\nare notable improvements. The ingenuity manifested in the mechanical\r\nproduction of gold and silver “parts,” to be afterwards put together\r\ninto great varieties of patterns, is remarkable. “Sand blast” is a\r\nnew mechanical means used for producing the rich dead surface so much\r\nadmired on gold and silver. The lathe, draw bench, die stamp, and\r\npress, effect much more than they did for the trade 20 years ago. Gas\r\nengines are now commonly used, even in small shops.\r\n\r\nPRECIOUS STONES.--The gem and precious stone business together with\r\nthat of the lapidary form a most important element of the jewellery\r\ntrade. We have some 35 local stone dealers and lapidaries. Besides\r\nthese, Birmingham is visited constantly by dealers from London, Paris,\r\nHamburg, and elsewhere, who do large trades here. Diamonds and other\r\ngems in the rough are also sold here increasingly. Compared with date\r\nof last report, the sales of diamonds and other gems to the trade in\r\nthis town is probably twenty times larger. Single firms will each buy\r\nand mount up £20,000 or £25,000 worth of gems in a year. It is now a\r\nrecognised and distinct name of this branch of the trade, “Diamond and\r\nGem Mounter,” and the Directory gives about 25 of those who do not\r\nordinarily interfere with other jewellery. Many Birmingham factors now\r\ncarry magnificent stocks of diamond goods manufactured here, which was\r\nnot the case twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nPRICES AND CHEAPNESS.--Any comparative notes which did not recognise\r\nthe cheapness of modern jewellery would be incomplete. This cheapness\r\nis a real thing and not a delusion. Genuine gold and silver brooches,\r\nrings, bracelets, &c. set with gems, are now offered throughout the\r\ncountry, at prices which often cause doubts of their quality. Gold, it\r\nis true, remains at the same standard value; but silver is one-fifth\r\nlower in price. Several causes have acted together, resulting in this\r\nconsiderable reduction in retail selling prices of both gold and\r\nsilver goods. First, workmen’s prices are much lower, although their\r\ntotal weekly earnings are not materially altered. This is effected by\r\nmechanical improvements; by the larger quantities of one pattern made\r\nat once; and by the employment of girls and youths under men. Secondly,\r\nthe rates of profit realised by manufacturer, factor, and shopkeeper\r\nare lower. Lastly, diamonds and some other gems extensively used are\r\nmuch lower in price, especially their second and third qualities, than\r\nat date of last report.\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--as a rule, manufacturing jewellers neither cultivate\r\ntrade with shopkeepers nor with the private purchaser, but sell to\r\nthe factors, or middle men. A factor sees all their stocks, selecting\r\nfrom each to compose his own, and so offers a better variety to the\r\nshopkeepers throughout the kingdom than could otherwise be done.\r\nThere are in Birmingham about fifty of such factors. But the line of\r\ndemarcation is somewhat indefinite, because many of them manufacture\r\ncertain specialities for themselves. Still the system is the best under\r\npresent circumstances, and works on the whole to the mutual good of\r\nall parties. The factors in London, and merchants generally, are also\r\nlarge purchasers from Birmingham manufacturers. The Post Office is the\r\nchief engine of distribution for small parcels, and all little orders\r\nand repairs. Two private firms, however, do a considerable business by\r\ncollecting, through agents, in London, Coventry, and Birmingham, small\r\njewellery parcels, conveying them by rail, and then delivering them\r\nvery quickly and cheaply in those towns. The losses are practically\r\nnil, although perfect shoals of such little packages are despatched and\r\ndelivered daily by these means, together with the railways.\r\n\r\n=Lighthouse Apparatus.=--[J. KENWARD].--(B. 153). The Lighthouse Works\r\nof Chance Brothers and Co., Spon Lane, near Birmingham, are the only\r\nworks of the kind in the kingdom. The improvements since 1865 may be\r\nnoted under: (1) the optical agents, (2) the lamps and burners with the\r\nilluminant or fuel used in them, (3) the mechanical appliances. The\r\nsix original orders of optical apparatus distinguished by their radii\r\nand height are no longer the only types. There is the hyper-radial\r\nfirst order lens, whose focal distance is 1,330 millimetres, and\r\ndiameter about 104¾ inches, the usual first order being about 72½\r\ninches diameter, and there are several varieties below the 6th order\r\nwhose radius is 150 mm. Of these the Ship Light introduced by Messrs.\r\nChance with a focal distance of 125 mm., is the most important. Various\r\nnew arrangements of condensing lights where from one flame, certain\r\nsea sectors are strongly illuminated by means of vertical prisms,\r\nwhile other sectors are less intensely lighted, have been adopted\r\nwith signal success, as have also several special designs where a\r\ncoloured and a white beam of equal intensity are concerned. The new\r\nlenses for port and harbour lights, and those used with the electric\r\narc on board vessels of war for search purposes, introduced by Messrs.\r\nChance, may be named. The present two most powerful lights in the\r\nworld are the Macquarie at Sydney Heads (a revolving electric light of\r\nthe first order) and the Tino near Spezia, a revolving electric light\r\nof the second order. In both a single optical agent is employed, and\r\ncarbons from 15 to 25 mm. diameter. Another improvement is the ship\r\nlight lens designed to give adequate intensity and penetrating power\r\nin a vessel’s signal lights, especially her side lights, whereby an\r\nincreased luminous range can be secured and the risk of collision\r\ngreatly lessened. The vertical angle subtended by lenticular refracting\r\napparatus has been increased from 45° and 47° to 80°, and even by the\r\nuse of dense flint glass to 92°. In this way the normal power of the\r\ncentral or lens portion of a light, always two-thirds of the whole\r\npower, has been so augmented that it is found advisable to dispense\r\nwith the prisms both upper and lower, and to depend on the refractors\r\nalone. When higher degrees of intensity are needed, a second tier of\r\nlenses can be superposed on the first, and a third and fourth added,\r\na separate flame being in the focus of each tier. This has been done\r\nby Mr. Wigham, of Dublin, with gas flames, and by Sir James Douglas\r\nwith oil flames. The two great divisions of lighthouse apparatus into\r\nfixed sections and revolving sections have been extended. Thus the old\r\nfixed light, the revolving light with equally recurring single flashes,\r\nthe composite fixed and flashing light, always objectionable from its\r\nunequal power, have been supplemented by the occulting light, and the\r\ngroup flashing light which last was designed by Dr. John Hopkinson,\r\nand first constructed by Messrs. Chance. In this arrangement the beams\r\nare sent out in groups, each beam of the group being separated from\r\none another by a short interval of time, and each group by a longer\r\ninterval. The lights on a coast can thus be distinguished by their\r\nsingle flash, double flash, or triple flash.[56]\r\n\r\nILLUMINANTS AND BURNERS.--Mineral oil has been introduced, and special\r\nburners designed in order to burn it. The largest of the old colza\r\noil burners (known as Fresnel burners) has an intensity of 230 candle\r\nunits, or 23·6 candle units per square inch, while a similar burner\r\nfor paraffin has been reported as affording 415 candle units, or 44·3\r\nunits. The latest developed Trimley burner of Sir James Douglas, with\r\nnine concentric wicks, gives 49·8 units. The oil used has a flashing\r\npoint of 154° F. The average cost of mineral oil is one-fourth that of\r\nvegetable oil. Gas is also freely employed, and in the 108-jet burner\r\nof Mr. Wigham it has attained a power of 2,433 candles, and in the\r\n10-ring burner of Sir James Douglas, a power of 2,619 candles. Beyond\r\nthe highest reach of oil or gas burners, say 2,500 or 2,600 candles,\r\nis the electric arc giving an intensity of beam of ten millions of\r\ncandles. At the other end of the scale is the duplex burner, which,\r\nwith the new Chance lenses, is available in the smallest apparatus for\r\na horizon of from seven to ten miles.\r\n\r\nThe Spon Lane Lighthouse Works have been extended greatly since the\r\nlast visit of the Association. The unique methods of grinding and\r\npolishing the optical glass have not been materially changed, but the\r\nnumber and variety of machines have been largely increased. In the\r\nmechanical shops there is now a complete _outillage_ for turning,\r\ndrilling, shaping, screwing, &c., applicable to all the old designs and\r\nprocesses, and also the newer branches introduced since 1865. There\r\nare about 200 workpeople employed, many with consummate skill and\r\nintelligence, as may be assumed from the precise and highly finished\r\nwork in which they are engaged.\r\n\r\nAt this date about 260 complete sea lights and about 300 complete\r\nharbour lights have been sent out, together with about 200 smaller port\r\nlights and about 370 of the recently designed ship lights.\r\n\r\nVery striking specimens of optical science have been contributed by\r\nMessrs. Chance, as exemplified in the list of dioptric lights they have\r\nsupplied around our own coasts, of which The Longships, the Wolf Rock,\r\nthe Flamborough Head, the Hartland Point, the Start Point, the South\r\nStack Rock, The Casquets, Bull Point, Anvil Point, the Eddystone, and\r\nmany others are examples.\r\n\r\nMr. Kenward will be glad to give further information to any member of\r\nthe Association who may take an interest in the subject.\r\n\r\n=Locks and Lock Making.=--[J. C. TILDESLEY.]--(B. 77.) The price of\r\ncheap padlocks is still lower. Iron padlocks of the cheapest class are\r\nnow being made in this district (Willenhall) and delivered free in\r\nBombay and Calcutta, at _fivepence halfpenny per dozen_!\r\n\r\nIn reference to the table (B. 89), the number of employers may be set\r\ndown as 100 less (that is 350) and at least 1,000 must be deducted from\r\nthe total number of workpeople, bringing it to about 3,950.\r\n\r\nThe production of locks in the district may now be computed at 25,000\r\ndozens per week, as against 31,500 dozens per week, as estimated in\r\n1865. The reductions being chiefly in the pad, cabinet, chest, and till\r\ndepartments, which are being driven hard by America and continental\r\ncompetition. On the other hand, door locks (rim, dead, mortice, and\r\ndrawback) are being made in larger quantities than ever, and are being\r\nsold at prices which would have been regarded as fabulous twenty years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nThe average earnings of locksmiths are 15 to 20 per cent. less than\r\nthe figures given at (B. 89.) American competition in castings has,\r\nso far as the lock trade is concerned, considerably diminished since\r\n1865. By grinding English sand to the fineness of flour, and by the\r\nadoption of Plaster of Paris moulds and improved methods of casting,\r\ntransatlantic supremacy over England no longer prevails. While in the\r\nmatter of cheap and clear castings they have maintained for their\r\nproductions the reputation for practical qualities which has so long\r\ndistinguished them. Artistic design and ornamentation have improved.\r\nGermany is now the most formidable rival to the English lockmaker,\r\nowing to the low wages and long hours endured by the German locksmiths.\r\nThe remedy for this state of affairs ought, in the interests both of\r\ncommerce and humanity to be found not in a retrograde movement on the\r\npart of England to Germany, but in the uprising of the German workman,\r\nto secure the same _status_ as that enjoyed by his English confrere.\r\n\r\n=Magic Lantern Slide Painting.=--[H. H. STANTON.]--The old fashioned\r\nmethod of tracing from a drawing or engraving though still used, has\r\ngiven way to a great extent to the introduction of photography. Special\r\ndrawings are made, photographed on to glass, and subsequently painted.\r\nGirls and also artists are employed in the work. Photographic slides\r\nfrom various parts of the world come to Birmingham to be finished.\r\n\r\n=Measuring Rules and Tapes.=--[JOHN RABONE.] (B. 628.) It is\r\nnoteworthy that in the “garret” at Heathfield Hall, near Birmingham,\r\nwhere Watt amused himself during the latter years of his life with\r\nhis copying machines--the prototypes of those afterwards known as the\r\nAmerican and Enfield--is still to be seen an example of Watt’s early\r\nwork in London before he entered upon his remodelling of the steam\r\nengine in connection with Matthew Boulton.\r\n\r\nIn one of the drawers there are preserved several of the old fashioned\r\ntools, formerly, and still used in rule making by hand, and also\r\ncarefully wrapped up in paper by Watt himself, is a “brass sector with\r\na French joint,” which, unlike his compasses and other mathematical\r\ninstruments, has undergone no wear, and is as faultlessly clear and\r\nperfect as it was on the day it left the maker’s hands. The only\r\nassumption that can be made respecting it is that it is the identical\r\n“brass sector with a French joint,” of which young Watt so glowingly\r\nwrote to his father, now a hundred and thirty years ago; and if that\r\nbe so, it is the only known specimen of the great engineer’s work as a\r\nrule maker.\r\n\r\nPrior to the last meeting of the British Association in Birmingham, in\r\n1865, machinery had been brought into the trade to but a small extent\r\ncompared with what has since been the case in the making and marking\r\nof all kinds of rules. Accurately engine-divided, 2-feet folding steel\r\nrules, retailed at a shilling each, are a new feature of the trade,\r\nwhich is a boon to mechanics they never before had. The employment of\r\nautomatic machinery has quite revolutionised the trade, by bringing\r\nlarger capital into it, and increasing the number of workpeople\r\nsixfold, at the same time enabling employers to pay higher wages than\r\nthey could possibly do when all depended upon unaided hand labour. The\r\ntrade has always been in comparatively few hands, three-fourths of the\r\nnames appearing in one directory as makers, being merely dealers, or\r\njourneymen; in one case fifteen of the men so described being merely\r\njourneymen of one employer. The bulk of the trade is now in the hands\r\nof as few makers as might be counted on the fingers of one hand, but\r\ncompetition is not rendered thereby less severe, but is rather more\r\nexcessive. During the past twenty years a great change has taken place\r\nin many countries by the adoption of the metre as a standard measure.\r\nSince 1870 all the numberless measures of little German towns, many\r\nwith both decimal and duo-decimal divisions, have been abolished, and\r\nthe use of the metre alone legalised. Other nations have followed the\r\nexample of Germany. Many of the rules made for export to such countries\r\nas Russia, which have not legalised the metre, are marked with it in\r\naddition to the local measures, thus preparing the way for its future\r\nadoption. Its use has been legalised in Great Britain, though not\r\nmade compulsory, and many of the measures made for export to foreign\r\ncountries where English customs prevail are marked with both English\r\nand metrical divisions.\r\n\r\n=Military Arms Trade.=--[J. D. GOODMAN.]--(B. 381.) At the date of the\r\nnotice of the gun trade, published in the transactions of the meeting\r\nof the British Association held in Birmingham in 1865, the British\r\nforces were armed with muzzle-loading guns. The arm of the service was\r\nthat known as the “Enfield Rifle.” It was adopted by a committee of\r\nmilitary officers, appointed by Lord Hardinge, Master General of the\r\nOrdnance, in 1853.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 the breech-loading system was receiving much attention.\r\nThe Wesley Richards’ Breech-loader had been for some time in use\r\nin the service on an experimental scale, and had been tested in\r\nthe field, both in China and New Zealand. So far back as 1861, a\r\nthousand breech-loaders, on Terry’s principle, had been issued to the\r\ntroops, but did not prove successful. Trial was also made of Sharp’s\r\nAmerican Breech-loading Rifle. The successful use of the Needlegun\r\nBreech-loader, by the Prussians, in the Danish war of 1864, gave great\r\nurgency to the enquiry.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1864, the English Government invited proposals for the\r\nconversion of the Enfield rifle into a breechloader. Fifty different\r\nsystems were sent in, of which five only were ultimately selected for\r\ntrial. Four of these were capping and one was a non-capping arm--that\r\nis, one in which the cartridge carries its own ignition. On 14th March,\r\n1865, the Woolwich Committee issued their Report on the various systems\r\nwhich had been submitted, in which after speaking of the obvious\r\ndisadvantages which a breechloader requiring a cap presents, when\r\ncontrasted with one adapted for a cartridge carrying its own ignition,\r\nproceeds to say:--\r\n\r\n    “The Committee have now respectfully to submit their\r\n    observations on the whole question.\r\n\r\n    “The ultimate armament of the infantry with breech-loading\r\n    weapons is determined upon. It would be done at a comparatively\r\n    small cost by conversion, but it is now well known that the\r\n    calibre, twist, and form of rifling of the ‘Enfield’ is not\r\n    the most favourable for fine shooting, and it is quite certain\r\n    that no converted arms can possess the precision which will\r\n    be easily attained in a new breechloader of smaller gauge and\r\n    quicker twist. Nor will the soldier be able to carry that\r\n    increased quantity of ammunition, which is so desirable,\r\n    without a reduction of calibre.\r\n\r\n    “There are certain circumstances in which, notwithstanding\r\n    all the inconveniences which will attend the co-existence\r\n    of unaltered arms, converted arms, and new arms, with their\r\n    different ammunitions, it may still be desirable to proceed\r\n    with the conversion on the ground of its small cost, and of\r\n    the less time in which the arms can be turned out; but the\r\n    Committee do not feel in a position at present to recommend\r\n    such a measure.”\r\n\r\nIn the end, the economical view prevailed, and it was determined to\r\nconvert the Enfield rifles to the Snider system. The effect of this\r\ndecision was to postpone to 1871, when the Martini rifle was adopted,\r\nthe advantages recognised in the Woolwich Report, which would be\r\nobtained by a smaller bore, quicker twist, and a different form of\r\nrifling.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1866, the Birmingham Small Arms Company was instructed to\r\nproceed with the conversion of the Enfield rifles to breech-loaders to\r\nthe full extent of their power. The London Small Arms Company was very\r\nshortly afterwards established. They received similar instructions.\r\nThe result was that the whole of the Enfield rifles available were\r\nconverted, as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Enfield (Government Factory)      296,352\r\n  Birmingham Small Arms Company     156,000\r\n  London Small Arms Company          85,200\r\n                                    -------\r\n                                    537,552\r\n\r\nAs this number was insufficient for the requirements of the service,\r\nand as it was indispensable that there should be but one description\r\nof arm in use, it became necessary that new Sniders should be made.\r\nIn 1869, and subsequently, orders were issued to the trade, and the\r\nfollowing supplies were made:--\r\n\r\n  Enfield                           200,523\r\n  Birmingham Small Arms Company      92,837\r\n  London Small Arms Company          42,525\r\n  National Arms Company               2,000\r\n                                    -------\r\n                                    337,885\r\n\r\nMaking a total of 875,437 Snider arms.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the Martini-Henry rifle resulted from an invitation to\r\ninventors, issued by the War Department first in 1866. More than 100\r\ndifferent arms and 49 descriptions of ammunition were sent in, but the\r\ncommittee appointed to make the selection reported that none came up\r\nto the requirements. The invitation was repeated in December, 1867,\r\nresulting in 45 additional arms being submitted. In February, 1869, the\r\nCommittee reported recommending a combination of the Martini Breech\r\nAction and the Henry rifling, and for the ammunition, the Boxer coiled\r\ncase. During the following year, trials of this arm were made in the\r\nservice, and finally, in 1871, it was definitely adopted. Orders were\r\nafterwards issued to the trade, and the following statement shows the\r\nnumbers which have been manufactured at the Government Factory, and by\r\nthe trade, up to March, 1885:--\r\n\r\n  Enfield                           583,798\r\n  Birmingham Small Arms Company     107,219\r\n  London Small Arms Company          74,131\r\n  National Arms Company              12,456\r\n                                    -------\r\n                                    777,604\r\n\r\nIt has now (July, 1886) been decided to adopt a new arm, embodying\r\nthe improvements suggested by the experience gained in the use of the\r\nMartini, during the service it has undergone. It has been found that\r\nthe calibre of the barrel if still further reduced would much improve\r\nthe shooting, an increase being made at the same time in the twist of\r\nthe rifling. A Committee has for some time past had the matter under\r\nconsideration, and finally have recommended an arm which is to be known\r\nas the Enfield-Martini.\r\n\r\nIn the new arm, the Martini action is retained, the outside dimensions\r\nof the barrel are the same, but the bore is reduced from ·45 inch to\r\n·4 inch. While the twist of the rifling is increased from 1 turn in\r\n22 inches to 1 turn in 15 inches. The weight of the bullet is reduced\r\nfrom 480 grains to 384, the powder charge being the same as in the\r\nformer rifle, 85 grains. A wooden hand guard is fixed over the breech\r\nend of the barrel to protect the hand of the soldier when the barrel\r\nbecomes heated by rapid firing. The barrel is no longer imbedded in\r\nthe fore-end of the stock; it was found that the exterior of the\r\nbarrel was liable to rust from contact with the wood. The fore-end\r\nis now so shaped that the barrel simply lies upon it, held in place\r\nby the bands which surround both stock and barrel. The back sight is\r\nprovided with a wind gauge, and a locking bolt secures the trigger\r\nwhen the arm is at full cock. A sword bayonet is substituted for the\r\nformer triangular-shaped bayonet. A “quick loader” will be used with\r\nthis arm. It hangs on the side of the body of the action, and holds\r\nsix cartridges. The cartridges are acted upon by a spring which forces\r\nthe head of the cartridge through an aperture in the lid, ready for\r\nthe soldier’s hand. With this “quick loader,” six rounds can be fired\r\nin about 25 seconds, whereas, in loading from the pouch, 40 seconds\r\nare required. This description, of the new arm may be subsequently\r\nmodified, as the recommendation of the Committee has not yet been\r\nconfirmed.\r\n\r\nDIMENSIONS, &C., OF THE BREECH-LOADING ARMS OF THE BRITISH SERVICE.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------+----------+-----------+-----------\r\n                                    |          |  MARTINI  | ENFIELD-\r\n                                    |  SNIDER. |   HENRY.  | MARTINI.\r\n  ----------------------------------+----------+-----------+-----------\r\n           RIFLE.                   |         |            |\r\n                                    |          |           |\r\n  Length of Barrel                  |   39in.  | 33³⁄₁₆in. | 33³⁄₁₆in.\r\n  Length over all                   |4ft. 7in. |4ft. 1½in. |4ft. 1½in.\r\n  Length with Bayonet               |6ft. ½in. |5ft. 11½in.|5ft. 11½in.\r\n  Weight with Bayonet               |9lb. 14oz.| 9lb. 14oz.|10lb. 4oz.\r\n  Weight without Bayonet            |   9lb.   |    9lb.   | 9lb. 6oz.\r\n  No. of Grooves in Barrel          |    3     |     7     |    7\r\n  Calibre                           |   .577   |    .45    |   .4\r\n  Twist of Rifling       1 turn in  |   78in.  |   22in.   |  15in.\r\n  Velocity of Muzzle per second     |  1240ft. |   1315ft. |  1570ft.\r\n  Trajectory at 500 yards           | 11.35ft. |  8.594ft. | 6.704ft.\r\n  Figure of Merit at 500 yards      |  0.89ft. |   0.55ft. |  0.30ft.\r\n                                    |          |           |\r\n           AMMUNITION.              |          |           |\r\n                                    |          |           |\r\n  Weight of Loaded Cartridge, grains|    715   |    758    |   718\r\n            Powder              ”   |     70   |     85    |    85\r\n            Bullet              ”   |    480   |    480    |   384\r\n  ----------------------------------+----------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF ARMS USED BY OTHER COUNTRIES.\r\n\r\n  ------------------+--------------------------+---------\r\n       COUNTRY.     |       DESCRIPTION.       | CALIBRE.\r\n  ------------------+--------------------------+---------\r\n  America, U.S.     | Springfield              |  ·450\r\n  Austria           | Werndl                   |  ·433\r\n  Belgium           | Albini Braendlin         |\r\n  Denmark           | Remington                |  ·433\r\n  Egypt             | Remington                |  ·433\r\n  France            | Gras                     |  ·433\r\n  France            | Kropatschek Magazine Gun |\r\n                    |   in Navy                |  ·433\r\n  Germany           | Mauser                   |  ·433\r\n  Greece            | Gras                     |  ·433\r\n  Holland           | Beaumont                 |  ·433\r\n  Italy             | Vetterli                 |  ·408\r\n  Norway and Sweden | Jarman                   |  ·397\r\n  Portugal          | Martini Henry            |  ·450\r\n  Roumania          | Peabody Martini          |  ·450\r\n  Russia            | Berdan                   |  ·420\r\n  Servia            | Berdan                   |  ·420\r\n  Spain             | Remington                |  ·433\r\n  Switzerland       | Vetterli Magazine        |  ·409\r\n  Turkey            | Peabody Martini          |  ·450\r\n  ------------------+--------------------------+---------\r\n\r\nAs it is essential that all arms made for the service should be\r\ninterchangeable, the orders to the trade have been confined to the\r\nfactories where the work is done exclusively by machinery, viz., to\r\nthe Small Arms Company and National Arms Company in Birmingham, and to\r\nthe London Small Arms Company, whose works are at Bow. The National\r\nArms Company, which was incorporated in January, 1872, is no longer\r\nin existence, having gone into liquidation in December, 1882. With a\r\npaid up capital of £330,000 they erected gun works at Sparkbrook, and\r\nammunition works at Holdford. The gun works have now been purchased by\r\nthe Government, and the Holdford Works are on the market for sale. The\r\nsame irregularity in the Government employment, which proved fatal to\r\nthe National Arms Company, acted very prejudicially for both the other\r\nCompanies. The Birmingham Company paid no dividend during the five\r\nyears 1879-83, and a nominal one only in 1884.\r\n\r\nTo this uncertainty of Government employment may be attributed\r\nthe difficulty of obtaining swords and bayonets, to which, a short\r\ntime since, attention was called in Parliament. When military arms\r\nwere supplied by the ordinary hand-made trade, there were four\r\nbayonet-makers in Birmingham and West Bromwich, where, now, there is\r\nnot one; and in Birmingham there is only one manufacturer of swords,\r\nwhen formerly there were several. The manufacture of triangular\r\nbayonets has been, with trifling exceptions, confined of late to\r\nEnfield, while sword bayonets, not made at Enfield, have been procured\r\nfrom Solingen. The future Enfield-Martini is to be provided with a\r\nsword bayonet. The plainly expressed wish of the House of Commons is\r\nthat in future, all swords and sword bayonets shall be made in England,\r\nof English material. There will not be the slightest difficulty in\r\ncarrying out this wish. Birmingham will be able to produce any number\r\nthat may be wanted, but to keep together the required staff of workmen\r\nit is necessary that the demand should be continuous.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of rifles, as well as bayonets, there is every\r\nreason to hope that the future employment of the trade will be more\r\nregular and continuous. The past bitter experience has shown that\r\nthe trade cannot live without steady employment, and it is now fully\r\nrecognised that it is not desirable that this country should remain\r\ndependent for its supply of arms on one Government manufactory at\r\nEnfield.\r\n\r\nAMMUNITION.--Up to the present time the English Government have adhered\r\nto the use of the Boxer cartridge, the case of which is made up of thin\r\ncoiled brass, attached to an iron base, which carries the ignition.\r\nFor some years past all other European nations have used a solid metal\r\ncartridge case, _i.e._, a case in one piece stamped out of a flat disc.\r\nThe English Government have now decided that the solid case shall be\r\nused, with the new Enfield-Martini rifle. A plant for the manufacture\r\nof these cartridges is being prepared at Woolwich. It is fully\r\nintended also to employ the trade. Orders have already been issued\r\nto the Birmingham Small Arms Company and Messrs. Kynoch and Company,\r\nBirmingham, and Messrs. Eley Brothers, of London, who have all had long\r\nexperience in the manufacture of this description of cartridge.\r\n\r\n=Nails (cut).=--[R. F. MARTINEAU.]--(B. 613). The machines for cutting\r\ntacks and small nails up to 1½ inch are now fed automatically. One\r\nunskilled workman can keep five or six machines going. The machines do\r\nnot work so fast as the hand fed, but there are fewer stoppages, and\r\nthe quantity turned out is greater. This improvement has reduced the\r\nprice 30 per cent. The present machines turn out the work so that it\r\nneed not be looked over and sorted as was formerly the case. The cut\r\nnail trade has developed in the North and at the present time, there\r\nare as many nails made at Leeds as at Birmingham. The better class\r\nof nail is, however, supplied from Birmingham. London brewers send\r\ncoasting vessels up the east coast with cargoes of stout, and they\r\nreturn from Hull with cut nails at very low freight. The quantity of\r\nnails made in Birmingham is about the same as in 1865. The French and\r\nBelgians have given up making cut nails, but they make tacks. No French\r\ntacks or _tingles_ (the smallest sort of tacks used in the shoe trade)\r\nare now imported into England, on the contrary, some are being exported\r\ninto France.\r\n\r\nMild steel has been introduced since 1865. Steel nails are now being\r\nmade at only a shilling per cwt. above the price of iron nails. These\r\nsteel nails will clench, and hence are replacing wrought nails.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of wire nails has been introduced into Birmingham since\r\n1865. On its introduction, wire was imported from Germany and Belgium,\r\nowing to its cheapness and low freight, but now, as English wire has\r\nfallen in price, it is used in preference to the foreign.\r\n\r\nWire nails are suited for hard wood, hence a large trade is done in\r\nthem in Australia. The Cape, India, and South America, are markets\r\nfor Birmingham nails. Women get about ten shillings a week. Youths\r\nas feeders about 15 to 20 shillings, skilled mechanics from 30 to 50\r\nshillings, and labourers 15 to 20 shillings per week.\r\n\r\n=Needles and Fish Hooks.=--[J. M. WOODWARD.]--(B. 197). The pointing\r\nof needles is now done exclusively by machinery. The new machines\r\nintroduced into the trade within the last 25 years, are the machines\r\nfor cutting, *pointing, *skimming, stamping, eyeing, *point handing,\r\n*tempering, scouring, *handing, *counting, heading and tailing,\r\nblueing, *burnishing, *finishing, assorting, and sticking. The machines\r\nmarked with * produce not only cheaper, but better quality of work.\r\nElectro-gilding has taken the place of the old ether gilding. As\r\nregards machinery used in the production of sewing machine needles,\r\nthe chief novelty is the “grooving” machine, which is taking the place\r\nof the old stamping process. From special enquiries made I conclude\r\nthat in the needle district the weekly productions of all kinds of\r\nneedles and goods akin to needles, cannot be less than 50,000,000 in\r\nnumber. _Pins._ In addition to pins in ordinary use, steel and glass\r\nheaded pins are made at Redditch, the weekly production of all kinds\r\nof pins being about two tons. An attempt is being made to adapt the\r\nmachines for the production of two pins at a time instead of one. _Fish\r\nhooks and fishing tackle_ are now made almost entirely by machinery.\r\nArtificial fly making is altogether done by hand; feathers of various\r\nbirds are used for “sea flies.” Spinning baits are shaped much like the\r\nbowl of a spoon, and are electro-plated so as to cause a glittering\r\nappearance when in motion. Swivels in connection with these baits form\r\na branch industry, and machinery for the dressing and turning of these\r\nhas of late been introduced.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of fishing rods is now an important branch. Among\r\nthe new aids to production are the turning machine and the machine\r\nfor splitting bamboo canes for the manufacture of “split cane” rods.\r\nThese curious and costly articles first came from America, and the\r\nmaking of them by hand requires the greatest patience as well as the\r\nhighest skill in joining, every part of the rod, from the butt to the\r\nthinnest member, having to be split lengthwise into six pieces, each\r\nwedge-like in section, and then glued together again with the greatest\r\ncare and exactness. Reel making has been introduced of late years. One\r\nmanufactory turns out about 50 dozen rods, 7,000 floats, 13,000 flies,\r\n4,000,000 fish-hooks, and 5,000 swivels per week. Electro-tinning is\r\nnow used for small sea-hooks. The weekly production of fish-hooks is\r\napproximately 20,000,000.\r\n\r\n=Nickel, Cobalt and German Silver.=--[ALFRED S. JOHNSTONE.]--(B. 673.)\r\nMany of the original sources of nickel have become exhausted. It is now\r\nfound plentifully in Norway (in magnetic pyrites, containing about 4\r\nor 5 per cent.) Hungary still supplies ore. The South African supply\r\nof ore, (an arsenide of over 25 per cent cobalt) has fallen off. South\r\nAmerica and her desert of Atacama was a great source of nickel or\r\ncobalt, some of its hydrated arseniates reaching as much as 25% in\r\nthe ores of nickel, and 17% in the ores of cobalt. The sole mine in\r\nConnecticut has been worked for many years. Sweden has yielded nickel\r\nfrom the Klefra and other mines. Germany supplies nickel from the\r\nMansfeld mines. About 1874 nickel was discovered in the Island of New\r\nCaledonia, and large quantities of the ore were shipped to this country\r\nand to France. There appears now to be a constant supply from this\r\nsource. The ore is a double silicate of nickel and magnesia, averaging\r\n7 to 10% nickel. Later still nickel and cobalt have been discovered\r\nin Nevada. Passing over the history[57] of the production of nickel,\r\nwhich is already, to some extent, described in “Birmingham and Midland\r\nHardware District,” it should be mentioned that nickel, though brittle\r\nunder the hammer, has been successfully rendered malleable by treatment\r\nin which manganese is employed. The process of rendering nickel\r\nmalleable is due to Messrs. Wiggin & Co., who patented the process in\r\n1880. About the same time Dr. Fleitman, in Germany, succeeded also in\r\nrendering nickel malleable by using magnesium instead of manganese. The\r\nnickel thus produced may be rolled into plates and drawn into wire, or\r\nbe stamped, beaten or raised into any article of common use, and it may\r\nbe welded to itself or to iron. It is less malleable when it contains\r\ncarbon than when pure. Besides its application for the production of\r\nGerman silver, nickel is largely used as anodes for nickel plating,\r\nand for coinage in many countries. Its oxide is used in the Potteries\r\nfor giving a soft brown tint to china and earthenware, and it is\r\nalso employed for the production of nickel salts for plating. The\r\nGerman Government in 1873 adopted nickel alloy for coinage, and the\r\nexceptional demand advanced the price from 4/- to 16/- per lb. At the\r\npresent time, owing to the extensive supplies from all parts of the\r\nworld, and the keen competition in the trade, nickel is reduced to 2/-\r\nper lb.\r\n\r\nCobalt has scarcely any application; it is used as an anode in\r\nplating, and for some parts of scientific instruments. It does not\r\nwhiten copper to the same extent that nickel does. The oxides of cobalt\r\nare of great value in the arts, not only for the production of the\r\nbeautiful blue colours given to china, earthenware, and glass, but\r\nalso as a basis of the blue pigment known as cobalt blue. The oxide\r\nof cobalt was in 1841 40/- per lb.; to-day it is about 8/- per lb.\r\nLatterly there is a tendency to replace brass and electro-plate by\r\nwhite alloys which have nickel for their basis. Spoons, forks, fittings\r\nfor railway and ship fittings, bar fittings, and harness furniture have\r\nbeen largely manufactured from these metals. These alloys are known\r\nunder various names, such as silveroid, argentoid, navoline, nickeline,\r\naluminium metal, &c., but they are all varieties of German silver,\r\ncontaining in some cases small proportions of tin, lead, cadmium, and\r\nother metals.\r\n\r\n=Papier Mâché Trade.=--[E. H. HODSON].--(B. 566). Within the last\r\nfew years wood pulp imported from Sweden has been introduced as a\r\nsubstitute for paper pulp, and is used for small desks, work boxes,\r\njewel cases, and many other articles, thus enabling Birmingham\r\nmanufacturers to compete with Chinese and Japanese lacquered goods. A\r\nchange too has taken place in the mode of ornamentation. Instead of\r\nemploying artists at a high rate of wage, transfers are used which can\r\nbe applied to the articles by boys and girls. German papier mâché is\r\nimported into this country duty free, but on the other hand, English\r\npapier mâché is subjected to heavy duties before it reaches the German\r\nand Continental Markets. It should be mentioned that there still\r\ncontinues a steady demand for small quantities of expensive articles\r\nmade of papier mâché, though for the supply of the Million, the old\r\npapier mâché is replaced by the Swedish pulp above referred to.\r\n\r\n=Pewter & Britannia Metal Trade.=--[W. PERKS.]--(B. 617). The two\r\ntrades are distinct. Pewter consists of 95 parts tin, 4 parts copper,\r\nand 1 part antimony. The metal is cast in iron or brass moulds.\r\nBritannia metal is not cast, but rolled, stamped, swaged, or spun.\r\nIts composition is similar to pewter, but a little more antimony and\r\ncopper and less tin. The staple articles in pewter are still ale and\r\nwine measures, tankard and drinking cups, the most saleable shapes\r\nare identical with those which Hogarth painted in the early part of\r\nthe last century. There has been a revival of pewter for ink pots for\r\nBoard School use and home use. In foreign markets a tea-pot known as\r\nthe Dutch pattern is still sold of the same shape, style, and strength\r\nas it has been for the last 70 years. Makers have tried to introduce\r\nwrought metal pots instead of cast pewter, but the foreign traders do\r\nnot care for them. The trade in beer engines and bar fittings has much\r\nincreased within the last 20 years.\r\n\r\n=Plate, Crown, and Sheet Glass.=--[HENRY CHANCE.]--(B. 147.) In the\r\n1864 report it was mentioned that cast plate glass is manufactured\r\nat Smethwick (Plate Glass Company) crown, sheet, and rolled or rough\r\nplate glass at Smethwick (Messrs. Chance Brothers and Co.) and at\r\nStourbridge (Stourbridge Glass Company.) Of these three manufacturing\r\nestablishments, that of Messrs. Chance Brothers and Co. is the only\r\none now in operation. Antique glass for decorative purposes and glass\r\nshades are manufactured at Oldbury by Messrs. W. E. Chance and Co.\r\nCrown glass is now almost extinct; Messrs. Chance however still make\r\nthe very limited quantity required. The price of ordinary sheet glass\r\nhas fallen from one shilling and twopence per foot in 1884 prior to the\r\nrepeal of the duty, to three halfpence in 1886. Rolled plate glass is\r\nnow made by most of the manufacturers of sheet glass, and by several\r\nfirms who confine themselves to this branch of trade. The Siemens’\r\nregenerative furnace has not only been successfully applied to furnaces\r\ncontaining pots, but by its aid Messrs. Siemens have been able to\r\ndispense with pots and employ large tanks made of clay, for the melting\r\nof glass. By this means the process of melting and working becomes\r\ncontinuous. The raw materials are introduced at one end of the tank\r\nfurnace and arrive, after gradual transformation, at the other end, in\r\nthe shape of melted glass.\r\n\r\n=Plated Wares.=--[ELKINGTON AND CO.]--(B. 477.) A great impetus has\r\nbeen given to the trade owing to the development of hotel life in\r\nLondon and all large towns, together with the equipments required for\r\nocean-going steamers, in many cases special designs having reference\r\nto the building being required. On the other hand the taste of the\r\npublic is now for simple and useful designs. The old form of stamping,\r\nin which the stamp was lifted by one or more workmen, has been\r\nsuperseded by the method described on page 172. A dish cover which\r\nformerly required hundreds of blows now requires only six, and instead\r\nof the old process of smoothing the surface with hammer and stake a\r\n“wheeling” machine is used, and the swage or shape lapped over instead\r\nof mounting with a wire, the time consumed being about one twentieth\r\npart of that required by the old process. Improvements in metals used\r\nenables the hollow bodies of coffee and tea services to be “spun”\r\n(see page 174) instead of being slowly raised into form by wooden\r\nmallets and steel hammers. Spinning oval bodies is now extensively\r\npractised, though at one time it was considered impossible to treat\r\nGerman silver in this way. This process (oval spinning) is used only\r\nwhen one or two articles of a particular shape are required. When great\r\nnumbers are required stamping is the process adopted. Press work in\r\nshaping articles has considerably improved, and has replaced, to some\r\nconsiderable extent, the tedious process of chasing and embossing.\r\nEnamelling has been introduced, but owing to Japanese competition the\r\ntrade is gradually falling off. The enamelling, known as cloisonné is\r\nperformed as follows: The decoration, birds, flowers, &c., is traced\r\non the surface of the object to be enamelled, very thin wire of any\r\nmetal, but generally silver or copper, is then bent by hand to the\r\nvarious forms traced on the metal. This process requires the utmost\r\ncare. The wire thus bent is then soldered down to the surface of the\r\nobject, the different colours put in in the form of paste into the\r\ndifferent divisions formed by the bent wire, and the whole is subjected\r\nto intense heat until the colours are completely fused. When cold the\r\nsurface is rubbed down flat, and finally polished. In the champlevé\r\nprocess the spaces for the colours are cut out with a graver. The\r\nprocess of damascening largely carried on by Messrs. Elkington is\r\ndescribed at (B. 545.) Soldering arrangements are much improved, the\r\nintroduction of the patent blowpipe saves time, and the workman is able\r\nto solder, cleaner and produce a firmer jointing than with the old\r\nprocess. The sand blast is a new feature in the finishing department.\r\n\r\n=Refrigeration.=--[S. PUPLETT.]--Mechanical refrigeration owes its\r\ndevelopment to the enterprise of Birmingham men. The imports of ice\r\ninto the United Kingdom were in 1884 nearly 300,000 tons. Refrigerating\r\nmachinery is supplying ice in competition with these importations. In\r\naddition, refrigerating machinery is used in brewing for the purpose\r\nof cooling wort quickly, in bacon curing, in working of butter and\r\nbutterine, cocoa, and candles, in oil refining and tar distilling,\r\nand in telegraphic works for securing a low temperature when testing\r\ncables. Freezing machines have too been used in sinking and tunnelling,\r\nthe water being prevented from running into the shaft owing to the\r\nhardening of the earth by freezing. The cost of imported ice may be\r\ntaken as 20/- per ton, while machine ice can be made for 5/- per ton.\r\nThe first commercial machine, patented by James Harrison, of Geelong,\r\nin 1856, was an ether machine, and made in London. Afterwards machines\r\nof this kind were made by Mr. Philips, of the Atlas Works, in Oozells\r\nStreet, Birmingham. In 1861 Carré showed the advantages of ammonia over\r\nether as a refrigerant, and since then Mort and Dicholle, of Sydney,\r\nand Stanley, of London, have patented various modifications of the\r\nCarré system. Pictet has devoted many years to the subject, and has\r\nidentified himself with sulphurous acid as a refrigerant, and recently\r\nclaims to have discovered a fluid termed _liquide Pictet_, SCO₄;\r\nin addition to these refrigerants, air, water, chloride of methyl,\r\nbisulphide of carbon, carbonic acid, and nitrous oxide have been\r\nused. The machines made in Birmingham by the Birmingham Refrigerating\r\nCompany are ammonia machines. This form of machine consists of (1)\r\na multitubular vessel called the refrigerator, containing liquid\r\n(anhydrous) ammonia--in this vessel vaporization takes place; (2) a\r\nvapour pump, by which the ammonia formed by evaporation is exhausted\r\nfrom the refrigerator, compressed, liquefied, and forced into (3) the\r\ncondenser, consisting of a multitubular vessel surrounded by water;\r\n(4) a circulating pump for supplying the condenser with water; (5) ice\r\ntanks surrounded by a bath of a liquid of a low freezing point, such as\r\na solution of chloride of calcium or of common salt; (6) a circulating\r\npump for circulating the brine through the refrigerator and around the\r\nice tanks; (7) the steam engine or other motor for driving the vapour\r\nand circulating pumps.\r\n\r\n=Rope Making.=--[J. T. WRIGHT.]--(B. 578). Within the last few years\r\na machine has been introduced by Mr. Good, an American, for treating\r\nfibres as imported, more particularly Manilla. By means of fluted\r\nrollers, and a system of bars fitted with strong steel pins which press\r\nupwards into the hemp, the fibres are dressed and straightened out, the\r\noperation is aided by a patented machine known as Wright and Laider’s\r\nPatent Sun and Planet Hacklebus. Finally, the hemp fibres are drawn off\r\nthe pins and delivered in a compact and continuous sliver into a can\r\nplaced in front to receive it. These slivers being in one length, are\r\nnow passed on to the drawing frames to be accumulated together.\r\n\r\n=Steel Pen Trade.=--[MAURICE POLLACK.]--(B. 634.)--There has been\r\nlittle improvement since 1865. Muffles heated by gas on the plan of\r\nDr. Siemens, have been introduced for tempering and colouring, and\r\nordinary gas is also used in connection with these processes, but these\r\nimprovements are only used by one or two firms, and more as a matter of\r\nconvenience than as a means of making pens of a better quality or lower\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nMany patents have been taken out since 1865 for new styles of pens,\r\nthe most successful have been those which deal with the points; these\r\nhave been turned up or turned down, thickened, or planished, all for\r\nthe purpose of producing smooth points to glide freely over paper\r\neven with a rough surface. The fashion in paper and ink materially\r\ninfluences the style of pens. The J pens (so called because that letter\r\nwas embossed upon one of the first and best known broad points) have\r\nbeen extensively used, and have influenced hand writing, especially\r\nthat of ladies. Calligraphy as an art has fallen off in this country,\r\nand this has influenced pen manufacture. The most delicately made pens\r\nare manufactured for foreign use. There are, perhaps, not so many pen\r\nworks now as there were in 1865, but the productive power has vastly\r\nincreased. The present _weekly_ average of pens manufactured is about\r\n160,000 grosses, requiring from 16 to 18 tons of steel, of which only\r\n8 tons appears in the article, the rest being loss or waste. Pen steel\r\nis still produced in Sheffield, the best being made from Swedish\r\niron. The number of girls and women employed is from 3,200 to 3,600,\r\nwhilst the number of men employed as tool makers, rollers, engineers,\r\nstokers, &c., hardly exceeds 500. The increase in make since 1865,\r\nof quite 60 per cent. is mainly due to the export trade. No new pen\r\nmanufactories have been established since 1865, except in the United\r\nStates, where there are now four pen works, but of these, only one is\r\nof importance. In France, there are now only three pen manufactories,\r\nand the production is less than it was three years ago. In Germany\r\nthere is only one, and its make though improved in quality is very\r\ninconsiderable in comparison with the large consumption of steel pens\r\nin Germany. An attempt has been made to establish works in Russia,\r\nwhere the duty on steel pens is high, but after existing one or two\r\nyears, the manufactory was burnt down, and no attempt has been made\r\nto re-build it. The Customs duty on steel pens with the exception of\r\nRussia, are the United States, where it is 6d. per gross, is very\r\nmoderate, and prevents the importation of low and middle class pens.\r\nThe price obtained for steel pens depends more upon the reputation\r\nof the maker or of the mark than upon their intrinsic value, hence\r\nthe difficulty of giving an average value of each gross of pens\r\nproduced.[58]\r\n\r\n=Stourbridge Fire Clay.=--[GEORGE KING HARRISON.]--(B. 133.) The\r\ndistrict suffers from high railway rates. The quantity of clay raised\r\nper week now is about 3,500 tons, say 160,000 tons per annum. About 40\r\nmillion bricks are made per annum.\r\n\r\n=Salt.=--[J. H. HOLLYER.]--(B. 138.) At the Stoke Prior Works from\r\n500 to 700 hands are employed. The salt manufactured is from 3,000\r\nto 4,000 tons per week. The entire produce of salt in Worcestershire\r\nis about 250,000 tons per annum. The Brine pits are about 1,000 feet\r\ndeep. “Butter salt” is largely exported from Droitwich to India and\r\nAustralia. Round pans have been introduced since 1865. The aggregate\r\ntraffic, that is, coal received and salt forwarded, of the Stoke Prior\r\nworks is about 1,000 tons per day.\r\n\r\n=Swords and Matchets.=--[F. M. MOLE, JUN.]--(B. 649.) The conventional\r\nideas as to the extent of the sword trade are very erroneous. Our army\r\nis small and only horse soldiers and officers carry swords. When once\r\nequipped one single sword forger will produce what is required. Hence\r\nthe matchet trade is combined with sword manufacture. (The matchet is\r\na large knife used in sugar cultivation in the West Indies and Central\r\nSouth America.) The extraordinary demand for swords at the time of the\r\nCrimean war, and the inability of English firms to supply it, gave the\r\nstart to foreign competition. It is not generally known that the larger\r\nproportion of the officers’ swords sold in this country are either\r\nGerman swords imported complete or foreign blades mounted in London.\r\nThere have been several spurts in the trade, but these died out, and at\r\nthe present time Messrs. Robert Mole and Son, of Birmingham, are the\r\nonly manufacturers who take Government contracts. An outline of the\r\nmethod of manufacture is given in (B. 649) and is similar to that of\r\nedge tools generally--(see p. 208). In ornamenting the hilts of swords\r\nfire or mercury gilding[59] is used. The “gripe” is of wood (walnut or\r\nbeech), and covered with dog fish skin.\r\n\r\n=Tin Plate Ware.=--[A. N. HOPKINS.]--(B. 638.) Fifty years ago workmen\r\nmade a variety of articles with several pieces of tin plate soldered\r\ntogether. The introduction of machinery in the trade is reducing the\r\nnumber of skilled workmen. In 1835-6 Mr. Thomas Griffiths took out\r\na patent for stamping and burnishing; shortly afterwards Mr. J. H.\r\nHopkins commenced the manufacture of “Patent tea-pots.” Candlesticks\r\nand other articles made in the same way quickly followed, and stamping\r\nand burnishing opened up possibilities which till then had not been\r\ndreamed of in the trade. In 1840 what was thought a monster stamp\r\nwas put down to stamp the top of an 18-inch imperial dish cover.\r\nFurther improvements in stamping led to the trade being speedily\r\none of the most important, both in this town and the neighbouring\r\none of Wolverhampton. A little time later, tin plate workers turned\r\ntheir attention to the stamping of a few culinary articles, such as\r\ncolanders, gravy strainers, &c., and of wash-hand basins. In the\r\nmaking of these sheet iron was used, and the articles when finished\r\nwere tinned by the same process as that used by tin plate makers, and\r\nwere then sold as “tinned wrought iron hollow ware,” and once more an\r\nincreasing impetus was given to the trade. Milk pans and “prospecting”\r\npans were made in this way, and the advance made just at this time by\r\nthe Australian Colonies on the great discoveries of gold opened out\r\na large field, where the goods have been bought in ever-increasing\r\nquantities, while shortly after, the Cape and South America as well\r\nas Canada became large customers for a similar class of goods. India\r\ntoo came into the market for brass and copper articles, while Egypt,\r\nespecially about the time of the American Civil War, began to be a\r\nmost important customer for the copper utensils hitherto manufactured\r\nonly by the natives, but which the superior machinery the English\r\nmanufacturer possessed, enabled him to produce much better and cheaper.\r\nMeanwhile the French Exhibition of 1855 had shown to our manufacturers\r\nspecimens of stamping superior to anything they could produce, and\r\none or two unsuccessful attempts were made by them to obtain a nearer\r\ninspection of the French method of stamping or more properly pressing.\r\nIn one way and another it leaked out that the French makers employed a\r\npressure plate and a gradual forcing process, instead of the sharp blow\r\nby which the English stamper pounded his material into the required\r\nshape. The late Mr. Clutton Salt purchased the patent right for this\r\ncountry, and in 1867 a machine was in operation at the works of the\r\nBirmingham Enamel Co., with which Mr. Salt was at that time connected,\r\nand Messrs. Griffiths and Browett took out a licence to use the patent.\r\nImprovements in stamping followed, keeping well abreast of the new\r\nprocess, and ultimately outstripping it, especially as regards size of\r\nvessel produced.\r\n\r\nThe French system of pressing was taken up in the United States, and\r\nas early as 1865 the works of Lalance and Geoschein, at Woodhaven, New\r\nYork, were in active operation on this principle. In 1866 a Birmingham\r\nman, named W. Page, son of an old Birmingham worthy, travelled to New\r\nYork, and erected improved machines on the French system in the factory\r\nof Messrs. Ketcham and Co. These machines economised material, and at\r\nthe same time quickened production.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 Mr. Satchell Hopkins, of Birmingham, after communication with\r\nMr. Page, put down a number of machines on Mr. Page’s principle,\r\nincluding one which is even now the largest and most powerful of its\r\nkind. A similar form of machine was adopted by other firms, and there\r\nsoon followed an extraordinary development of the trade hitherto known\r\nas the “Stamped Tin Hollow-ware,” but now as the “Pressed Bright Tinned\r\nHollow-ware” Trade.\r\n\r\nIn another important branch of the trade, though there has not been so\r\nmuch scope for improvement, advance has not been wanting. The common\r\nand ugly japanned ware, in which stencil plates were largely used,\r\nhas been superseded by “transfers,” and by an invention of Mr. Alfred\r\nHopkins, the japanning of articles with backgrounds highly polished\r\nhas been superseded by a dead, morocco-like surface, in low tones of\r\npleasing appearance.\r\n\r\nIn iron plate working the only new mechanical appliance introduced\r\nsince 1867 is a machine or series of machines for making buckets, by\r\nwhich the article is practically made in one operation. The low wages\r\nof workmen who make buckets, coupled with the low prices to which\r\nmanufacturers have been driven by excessive competition, render the\r\nemployment of these machines of doubtful advantage. Besides Birmingham,\r\nmanufactories are established in Wolverhampton, London, Reading,\r\nSheffield, and other towns.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of Waste._--The following facts are supplied by Mr. T. J.\r\nBaker:--Sheet iron scrap and lathe turnings are worked up again into\r\nsheet iron. Copper clippings and turnings are remelted. Copper scale is\r\nresmelted, as also brass clippings and brass dust. Gold scrap of the\r\njapanning department is sent to the gold refiners, and the leaf metal\r\nscrap to the bronze powder manufacturers. Tin plate scrap, after the\r\nlarger pieces have been sold to the button makers, are “stripped”--that\r\nis, the tin is removed by immersion in hydrochloric acid. The resulting\r\ntin salt is used by calico printers. The iron scrap, after removal\r\nof the tin, is used for precipitating copper by the wet process. Tin\r\noxide, known as “drop tin,” formed on the surface of the metal in the\r\ntinning pot, is, after recovery of as much of the tin as possible, sent\r\nto the tin smelter. Galvanizing dross, an alloy of zinc and iron, which\r\nsinks to the bottom of the galvanizing bath, is removed by a perforated\r\nladle, and refined by distilling off the zinc. Zinc ashes, that is\r\ncinders which have fallen on the molten metal and absorbed zinc, is\r\nalso refined by distillation. Flux skimmings, or that which is skimmed\r\noff from the galvanizing bath, is an oxide and chloride of zinc. This\r\nis put in a vat; stirred with hot water, the oxide falls to the bottom\r\nof the vat, but the chloride dissolves. The clear solution is heated\r\nwith gas liquor, when zinc precipitates as carbonate, and the chloride\r\nof ammonium, now in solution, is recovered by evaporation. The solid\r\nresidues are worked up in paint mills into zinc white.\r\n\r\n=Tools (Heavy Edge).=--[A. WINKLER WILLS.]--(B. 656.) In addition to\r\nedge tools proper, such as axes, adzes, hatchets, and other articles,\r\nthe trade includes pickaxes, spades, shovels, forks, hoes, augers,\r\ntrowels, shipscrapers, &c. The number of patterns regularly supplied\r\nby the manufacturers of Birmingham and the neighbourhood is estimated\r\nat several thousands, each nation and almost each district requiring\r\nspecial patterns of its own. The character of the soil, habit of people\r\nand other circumstances affect the form of tool though used for the\r\nsame purpose. The enormous hoe, with a blade nearly a foot wide and\r\nof the same depth, which is in universal use in Guatemala, would be\r\nuseless in Valparaiso, because the soil is light in one country and\r\nheavy in the other.\r\n\r\nA Brazilian axe is made thus:--A piece of bar iron is taken and the\r\nmiddle part thinned out under a light steam hammer to the thickness\r\nrequired to form the edge of the tool. The blank is then doubled over\r\nupon itself and the bottom part welded together. A bar of hard cast\r\nsteel is welded on to the bottom of the blank; the steel being then\r\ncut off from the bar to a width corresponding to that of the blank.\r\nThe embryo axe, by means of a steam hammer, is forged under tools\r\nof suitable shape fixed in the head of the hammer, the final shape\r\nbeing given by hand tools. The tool is now ready for hardening and\r\ntempering--the steeled end of the axe is heated to a blood red in a\r\nslow furnace and is then plunged into cold water. It is now tempered\r\nby slowly heating till it assumes the required tint. The tool is now\r\nready to be ground, polished on a succession of wooden wheels or bobs,\r\ndressed with emery of gradually increasing fineness, and then to have\r\nits upper part japanned black, blue, scarlet, or bronze-coloured,\r\naccording to the taste of the consumer.\r\n\r\nThe principal machinery employed consists of shears, “squeezers,” tilt\r\nand trip hammers, striking from 200 to 400 blows per minute, steam\r\nhammers, shearing and punching machines, stamps, rolls, and lastly,\r\nmassive machines or presses of various construction, used for shaping\r\nthe eyes of hoes, pickaxes, &c. The wood handles required for spades,\r\nshovels, &c., form a distinct branch of the trade. Hickory handles\r\nare almost exclusively used in the wedge axes so largely employed in\r\nIndia and the colonies; these handles are necessarily imported from\r\nthe United States. Self-acting machines have during late years been\r\nintroduced for the turning of ash handles for axes, hatchets, &c. The\r\nhandles of spades, shovels, and forks are of ash sawn from planks,\r\nsubsequently turned in lathes. To bend them, they are steamed and\r\npressed into shape by powerful screws.\r\n\r\nThe only waste products are the scale or dross which falls from the\r\nheated iron, and the shearings or scraps cut off the tools. Both are\r\nsold to the ironmaster--the former for fettling his furnace, the latter\r\nto be worked up again into bar iron.\r\n\r\nThe number of persons employed in the trade in Birmingham and the\r\ndistrict is probably 3,000 to 4,000.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of the manufacture have been greatly altered during\r\nthe last seven years by the extensive introduction of machinery to\r\nreplace manual labour; at the present time a much larger number of\r\nboys and youths are employed than was formerly the case. Their wages\r\nrange from 8s. to 15s. per week according to age. Forgemen earn on an\r\naverage £2. 10s. or £3. per week; foremen smiths about £2., and their\r\nstrikers or underhands about £1. to £1. 5s, when in full work. Women\r\nare only employed in japanning, wrapping up and similar light work.\r\nThe revolution which has taken place in the method of manufacture\r\nduring recent years was largely accelerated by the tyrannical\r\noperations of the formerly powerful trades union of edge-tool makers,\r\nwhich, during the period of large demand which prevailed from 1872\r\nto 1874, used every available means to limit production, and to make\r\nit impossible for the manufacturers to execute orders in reasonable\r\ntime. As a consequence, the productive power of the trade has been so\r\nenormously increased that at present it is altogether disproportionate\r\nto the demand, and hence, in this as in almost every other branch\r\nof manufacture, unremunerative prices and reckless competition are\r\nunfortunately the order of the day.\r\n\r\n=Umbrellas and Parasols.=--[WILLIAM HOLLAND.]--(B. 666). Since the\r\nprevious article was written machinery has been extensively introduced,\r\nan umbrella rib being now made by automatic machinery in one operation\r\ninstead of several. The square or round iron wire for the stretcher\r\nis also similarly converted into form nearly ready for japanning. In\r\nsome cases, even the riveting or attaching the rib to the stretcher\r\nis done by machinery, but as yet the experiment remains to be proved\r\ngood and economical. The number of hands employed has increased. Some\r\nhundreds of men, women, girls, and boys are employed. The materials\r\nhave undergone a change, zinc and iron have displaced to a large\r\nextent brass and copper, and great competition has caused everything\r\nto be lightened and cheapened; but a reaction is taking place in this\r\nrespect, and better and stronger goods are coming into use. The various\r\nparts of umbrellas and parasols are now gilt, bronzed, enamelled,\r\nsilver and nickel-plated, instead of being simply japanned as was the\r\ncase formerly. The patents which have been taken out in connection\r\nwith umbrellas and parasols are numerous, and in many cases trivial.\r\nOver 800 patents were granted between 1867 and 1876, and since then\r\nthe inventive ball has been rolling still more rapidly. It has been\r\nproposed to use a transparent material to enable one to see ahead when\r\nprotecting the face with the umbrella. Another arranges for spinning\r\nthe umbrella so as to drive off the rain, other proposals are to fold\r\nthe umbrella so as to go inside a stick, to convert it when necessary\r\ninto a railway carriage key, a corkscrew, or a pike, writing materials\r\nhave been inserted in the handles, and a variety of contrivances\r\nproposed. One of the most curious of all these patents is one for\r\nfixing the umbrella to the hat somewhat after the fashion of the\r\nthatched Indians of whom one reads in books of travel.\r\n\r\n=Watch Manufacture.=--[R. L. BRAGGE.]--The “watchmakers” of Birmingham\r\nof forty or fifty years ago were rather repairers than makers, though\r\nthere was scarcely a part of the mechanism of a watch which they\r\nwere not at times obliged to make. Of these watchmakers, S. Allport,\r\nof Bull Street, was considered to take the lead. There were also\r\nT. Warwick, in Colmore Row; Birley, in High Street, and others. At\r\nthis time the highest class watches were made in London. Liverpool\r\nalso had a reputation for goods of high quality. Coventry, however,\r\nenjoyed a larger industry than either of the other centres named.\r\nThe first earnest and persistent effort to include watch manufacture\r\nas a Birmingham industry was made by Messrs. Hodgkins and Booth, who\r\ncommenced about 1843, and continued till 1850, when Messrs. Betts and\r\nFairfax succeeded to the business. Messrs. Charles Wood and Sons, of\r\nBath Street and of St. Paul’s Square, not long afterward gained a\r\nreputation as manufacturers of high quality watches. Mr. W. Ehrhardt,\r\nin 1873, erected a large manufactory for production of watches\r\naccording to modern ideas, and the English Watch Company (Limited) have\r\nalso erected extensive ranges of shopping in Villa Street. Exclusive\r\nof “jobbers,” there are probably about 600 to 700 artisan watchmakers\r\nemployed in the town, about 30 per cent. of whom are females; some 500\r\nof these are employed at the two large manufactories just mentioned.\r\nIt is probable that nearly 700 watches per week are turned out in\r\nBirmingham. Birmingham watches have a good reputation, and there is not\r\na “duffer” watch turned out from one year’s end to another.\r\n\r\nOne singular feature of the trade is that the name of the maker rarely\r\nappears on a watch--manufacturers generally put on the names of their\r\ncustomers. Many large export houses have adopted fictitious names,\r\nunder which a certain pattern watch has attained a reputation that\r\nmakes the name a valuable property. A large Colonial trade is done on\r\nthese lines.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Dennison, Wigley, and Co., manufacture watch cases, employing\r\nabout 100 hands, making the cases for American companies. These cases\r\nas well as many Swiss ones pass through the Birmingham Assay Office,\r\nand are afterwards sent abroad for the movements to be fitted in. Since\r\nthis practice prevailed, it is obvious that the Assay Office returns\r\nare no index of the number of watches made in this town. Almost the\r\nonly branch of this trade which is not localised is the enamelling and\r\npainting of the dials. Watch glass making is scarcely practised in this\r\ncountry, nearly the whole supply of the watchmaking world coming from\r\nthe Continent.\r\n\r\n=Wire Working.=--[J. B. GAUSBY.]--(B. 596.) No marked departure from\r\nprocesses previously described has taken place. More attention is\r\nnow paid to decoration, and there is an endeavour to introduce more\r\nartistic designs. The large demand for wire netting made by machinery\r\nas described (B. 597) has led to a wide extension of locality for its\r\nmanufacture. Large wire drawing firms and galvanizers in different\r\nparts of the country have taken up the manufacture, so that although\r\nBirmingham still turns out a large quantity of the article, she has not\r\nbeen able to retain the manufacture within her bounds.\r\n\r\n=Wire (Steel).=--[CHARLES LEAN.]--(B. 591.) One hundred years ago\r\na horse was employed for drawing wire by a firm in the town. New\r\napplications of wire within recent years have been telephones, deep\r\nsea sounding, road and aerial tramways, and cycles. The scrap wire is\r\nutilised for nails; it is also bought by hawkers for the purpose of\r\nmaking riddles and a number of wire articles. No women or girls are\r\nemployed in the trade of the district, and perhaps about 700 men and\r\nboys, the bulk of whom draw iron wire only.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Other articles on Manufacturing Industries will be found in\r\nAppendix.--ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY AND PHYSIOGRAPHY. (BIRMINGHAM DISTRICT.)\r\n\r\nEDITED BY PROFESSOR CHAS. LAPWORTH, LL.D., F.G.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe town of Birmingham lies almost in the exact geographical centre\r\nof England and Wales, midway between sea and sea. Its distance in a\r\nstraight line from the three nearest sea-ports on the opposite sides\r\nof the island, Liverpool, Boston, and Bristol, is about 85 miles in\r\neach case, while its distance from London and Southampton is only a few\r\nmiles more.\r\n\r\nThe main watershed of Southern Britain, which commences to the\r\nnorthward in the Pennine Range and divides the rivers which flow\r\neastward into the German Ocean from those which drain westward into\r\nthe Irish Sea and the Bristol Channel, enters upon the Birmingham\r\nDistrict from the northward by way of Cannock Chase, crosses the “Black\r\nCountry” about six miles to the west of Birmingham, and passes out\r\nof the district to the southward through the Lickey Hills, round the\r\nheadwaters of the Avon to the Edge Hills and the Cotswolds.\r\n\r\nThe town of Birmingham and its immediate neighbourhood, is drained by\r\nthe brooklets which unite to form the river Tame, the first of the\r\nsouthern tributaries of the Trent. Thus, physiographically speaking,\r\nBirmingham lies well within the basin of the Humber. To the west of\r\nthe watershed of Dudley and the Lickey, the rivers of the district\r\nhave a short and rapid descent to the main stream of the Severn; to\r\nthe south eastward, they glide gently across the Midland Plain to its\r\ntributary--the soft-flowing Avon.\r\n\r\nThe physical centre of the district is the locality of Barnt Green,\r\na point on the Midland Railway, about eight miles to the south of the\r\ntown. From this point radiate the several low hill ranges which give to\r\nthe neighbourhood of Birmingham its distinctive character. The first of\r\nthese ranges (forming the main watershed, and constituting the natural\r\nbackbone of the area) is composed of the Lower Lickey Hills and their\r\nnortherly extensions--the rolling heights of Halesowen, the conspicuous\r\nmound of Rowley Regis (820 feet), and the beautifully wooded heights\r\nof Dudley Castle (730 feet), the Wren’s Nest, and Sedgley Hill. To the\r\nwest of this axial ridge, a second range bearing points of a somewhat\r\ngreater elevation, stretches from the same locality of Barnt Green\r\nthrough the Upper or Bromsgrove Lickey Hills (900 feet) to Hagley,\r\nwhere it is known as the Clent Hills (1,028 feet). These look out far\r\nand wide over the beautifully fertile valley of the Severn, and are\r\ncontinued to the north-westward in the heights of Stourbridge and\r\nAbbots Castle. To the east of the main Lickey and Dudley axis, the\r\ncountry is less conspicuously diversified. The hill-ranges are broader,\r\nand rise almost imperceptibly from the surrounding plains. The most\r\nimportant of these less elevated areas forms what may be termed the\r\nBirmingham plateau. This is an irregular strip of broken ground, about\r\ntwenty miles in length by four or five miles in breadth, which takes\r\norigin from the north-eastern slopes of the Lickeys between Northfield\r\nand Halesowen, and sweeps northwards through Harborne, Birmingham,\r\nBarr and Sutton Park, into the wild district of Cannock Chase. On\r\nthis irregular plateau stand the town of Birmingham and its suburban\r\nvillages of Harborne, Edgbaston, Moseley, Aston, Handsworth, and\r\nSutton Coldfield. The western side of the plateau overlooks the “Black\r\nCountry.” It is marked out by the terrace of Smethwick, Sandwell, and\r\nGreat Barr, and culminates in the conspicuous fir-topped hill of Barr\r\nBeacon (800 feet). The eastward margin of the plateau is much less\r\npronounced, and subsides gently into the great Midland plain of Warwick\r\nand Tamworth, along a line drawn from Northfield, through King’s Heath,\r\nMoseley, Camp Hill, and Sutton Coldfield.\r\n\r\nThe ground forming the Birmingham plateau rises and falls into an\r\nendless succession of heights and hollows; here sinking down into\r\nbroad tree-sheltered, stream-cut valleys, there rising into long low\r\nmounds and hills. The subsoil throughout is mainly gravel or sandy\r\nclay, and the underground drainage is, as a rule, excellent. The\r\nnorth-western half of the plateau still retains its original forest\r\ncharacter, and the primeval aspect of the district is recalled by the\r\nwild area of Sutton Park--a picturesque admixture of long, dry, pebbly\r\nmounds, covered with thick woods of oak, ash and holly, and divided\r\nfrom each other by open glades of gorse patches, with long, flat,\r\ntreeless expanses, shrouded in dark heather and picked out here and\r\nthere with deep, clear water-pools. The central half of the plateau\r\nis now covered by the great town of Birmingham and its immediate\r\ndependencies. The town stands upon a series of broad rounded knolls,\r\ndivided from each other by intervening open valleys. The more elevated\r\npoints are marked by the church of St. Philip’s, Newhall Hill, Soho\r\nHill, and the Monument; while the great maze of streets, manufactories\r\nand commercial buildings fill up all the space between. Strictly\r\nspeaking, the town proper lies in the angle included between the river\r\nTame and its little tributary the Rea. The Tame runs in a broad valley\r\nround the north-eastern side of the town to the low-lying district of\r\nSaltley, and thence takes its course north-eastward across the Midland\r\nplain towards the Trent at Burton. The little river Rea, which is the\r\nBirmingham river par excellence, runs from the Lickey Hills through\r\nthe south-eastern corner of the town, across the low-lying district of\r\nDigbeth, and joins the Tame at Saltley.\r\n\r\nThe south-western portion of the Birmingham plateau is occupied by\r\nthe fashionable district of Edgbaston and the neighbouring suburbs\r\nof Harborne and Moseley. While the original upland character of the\r\nplateau is still distinctly apparent, the dwellers in this southern\r\narea have in all other respects utterly changed its former aspect. The\r\nland has been reclaimed and enclosed. In place of the wild oak and ash,\r\nwe have masses of the Elizabethan elm, the fir and the beech; and in\r\nplace of the wild heather, cultivated lawns and grassy fields. Every\r\nadvantage has been taken of the natural resources of site and soil;\r\nand the result is that Edgbaston and its surroundings form one broad\r\nexpanse of mansions, woods and fields, well worthy of the town and\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nTo the westward of the Birmingham plateau lies the district of the\r\n“_Black Country_,” of which the town of Dudley is the natural centre.\r\nCompared with the Birmingham plateau, it is a lowland district of\r\nwild confusion--a maze of mines, chimneys, factories, and straggling\r\nvillages and towns, shrouded in a canopy of smoke and steam. The\r\nnatural soil is generally hidden from sight by heaps of mining spoil,\r\nand mounds of rubbish, cut through in all directions by lines of\r\nrailway and broad canals. The beautiful wooded hill of Dudley, crowned\r\nwith its grey keep, and the neighbouring oak-clad ridges of the Wren’s\r\nNest and Sedgley, rise like islands of verdure out of the dark sea of\r\nmining ground around, and look strangely out of place amid their gloomy\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nTo the east of the Birmingham plateau lies the broad plain of Tamworth\r\nand Nuneaton, watered by the sluggish stream of the Tame. The plain is\r\ncontinued far to the southward through the richly wooded district of\r\nWarwick, Alcester, and the old Forest of Arden, and thence down the\r\nvalley of Shakespeare’s Avon, to the terrace of the Edge Hills and the\r\nnorthern slopes of the Cotswolds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY. (BIRMINGHAM DISTRICT).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPaleozoic Rocks.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. C. LAPWORTH, LL.D., F.G.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nThe Birmingham district, or that area of which Birmingham constitutes\r\nthe natural capital and commercial centre, extends from Stafford on the\r\nnorth to Tewkesbury on the south, and from Wellington on the west to\r\nLeicester on the east, forming an area about 60 miles in length by 50\r\nin breadth.\r\n\r\nIn no single district in Britain is the relation of the physiography of\r\nthe country seen to be more strikingly dependent upon its geological\r\nstructure than within the limits of the Birmingham district. Every\r\nhill, ridge, plain, and valley of any importance is a mere reflex\r\nof the underground geology. The local distribution and physical\r\npeculiarities of its rock formations afford a natural and complete\r\nexplanation of all its special scenic peculiarities.\r\n\r\nThe dominant geological formation of this Midland area is the great\r\nMesozoic formation of the _Triassic_ or New Red Sandstone, which\r\nstretches through Southern Britain in a continuous band from Hartlepool\r\nto Exeter, and divides the broken and contorted Paleozoic rocks of\r\nthe west from the flat-lying Neozoics of the east. This great band of\r\nNew Red Sandstone attains its widest extension in the north of the\r\nBirmingham district, between Eccleshall and Charnwood Forest, where\r\nits transverse diameter is about 50 miles. Within the limits of the\r\nBirmingham district, however, its diameter rapidly decreases, until in\r\nthe extreme south, in the neighbourhood of Worcester and the Malverns,\r\nits breadth is reduced to about 10 miles.\r\n\r\nThe red rocks of this _Triassic_ formation not only form by far\r\nthe most predominant and most conspicuous geological feature of\r\nthe district at the present time, but not long since, geologically\r\nspeaking, they must have extended over the entire area in one unbroken\r\nexpanse. They now constitute a sheet of red sandstones and marls,\r\nthrough which protrude, in numerous bands and patches, the older\r\nPaleozoic rocks. Although nowhere very steeply inclined, these red\r\nbeds of the _Triassic_ have been bent into several long low arches, or\r\nbroad domes, whose longer axes range approximately north and south. The\r\nsummits of many of these arches have been denuded, and the underlying\r\nolder rocks have again been bared to-day. Four of these arches are\r\nespecially conspicuous, those of the Wrekin, Malvern, Dudley, and\r\nNuneaton. In each of these the underlying _Coal Measures_ are laid\r\nbare, forming the four coalfields of Coalbrookdale, Forest of Wyre,\r\nSouth Stafford, and Eastern Warwick, all of which shew round their\r\nouter margins a narrow band of the intermediate formation of the\r\n_Permian_. In each of these anticlinals, too, the denudation of the\r\ncore of the arch has been sufficient to wear away the _Carboniferous_\r\nfrom its centre, and to expose to view yet older formations--the\r\n_Old Red Sandstone_ in the Forest of Wyre, the _Silurian_ in South\r\nStaffordshire, the Malverns, and Coalbrookdale, and even the _Upper\r\nCambrian_ and its underlying igneous rocks in the Wrekin, the Lickey,\r\nand near Nuneaton. With the exception of the _Silurian_ of Abberley and\r\nDudley, and the recently discovered _Cambrian_ of Nuneaton, however,\r\nthese _pre-Carboniferous_ rocks are comparatively inconspicuous, rising\r\nup merely in narrow bands in the cores of long wedge-shaped hills.\r\n\r\nFrom the economical as well as from the structural point of view, by\r\nfar the most important of these geological arches is that of South\r\nStaffordshire, which is the southward continuation of the Pennine\r\nchain, and part of the true backbone of Southern Britain. The central\r\naxis of this arch runs, as we have seen, through the Dudley Hills, and\r\ndies away in the complex of faults to the south of the Lickeys. On\r\nthe natural consequences of the rise of this arch, all the physical,\r\nscenic, and economic peculiarities of the central parts of the district\r\nare essentially dependent. The hills and plains around Birmingham are\r\nall more or less related to this grand anticlinal--the hills marking\r\nthe uplifted edges of the harder rocks, the limestones, sandstones,\r\nand pebble beds; and the plains, the position of the gently inclined\r\nsoft shales and marls. It has brought within workable distance of\r\nthe surface the coals and ironstones of South Staffordshire, and the\r\nvaluable limestones of the Dudley Hills, and it has had its final\r\neffect in bringing together the overflowing population of the town and\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe original simplicity of the geological structure of the floor of\r\nthe Birmingham District is much complicated by fractures, faults,\r\nand unconformities. The Wrekin and the Malverns are both affected by\r\nprofound dislocations. The South Staffordshire Coldfield is bounded\r\nboth on the eastward and the westward by faults of more than ordinary\r\nmagnitude, while a long straight fault more than 20 miles in length\r\nruns through the south-eastern part of Birmingham itself, and flings\r\ndown the _Keuper marls_ of the Warwick plain against the older\r\nsandstones of the Birmingham plateau.\r\n\r\nIn the Birmingham District as everywhere in Britain, the _Triassic_\r\nformation rests unconformably upon everything below. At the same time,\r\nits members overlap each other more or less irregularly, and shew a\r\nrapid diminution in thickness when followed from west to east. Thus it\r\nhappens that not only do the _pre-Triassic_ rocks make their appearance\r\nin their expected positions along the main anticlinal lines, but many\r\nof the old ridges of Palæozoic rocks, which rose out of the Triassic\r\nwaters, have had their enveloping pall of red sandstone removed from\r\ntheir flanks and summits, which have thus been bared once more to\r\nthe light of day. Such are, in part, the ridges of the Wrekin, the\r\nMalverns, the Lickeys, and the Forest of Charnwood.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the Severn, to the west of Birmingham, the strata\r\nrun in narrow bands. The central portion of this valley lying between\r\nCoalbrookdale and Bridgnorth, to the west of the main anticlinal of\r\nthe Birmingham district, owes all its striking beauty and variety to\r\nthe rapid alternations of hard and soft strata which occur within its\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nIn the great Midland plain to the east of Birmingham, the strata\r\nare spread out in broad sheets. The plain is underlain in great part\r\nby the comparatively homogeneous flat lying Keuper marls, with their\r\nintercalated bands of harder sandstones. Its scenery is consequently\r\nless varied than that of the Severn valley, but it is rich in that\r\nsweet sylvan beauty which is almost peculiar to the English landscape,\r\nand it forms one broad expanse of gently rolling farmland and woodland,\r\nwhose green crested waves sweep onward to the east and south, mile\r\nbeyond mile, till they break against the long shore-like scarp of the\r\nharder Jurassics.\r\n\r\nTHE LOCAL ROCK FORMATIONS.\r\n\r\nAs will be apparent upon a study of the accompanying geological map,\r\nthe geological formations exposed within thirty miles of Birmingham,\r\ninclude the entire stratigraphical succession between the _Cambrian_\r\nand the middle portion of the _Jurassic_, with two notable exceptions.\r\nThe two formations locally wanting are the _Ordovician_ and the _Old\r\nRed Sandstone_. The nearest known _Ordovician_ rocks occur in central\r\nShropshire, to the east of Church Stretton; the nearest _Old Red\r\nSandstone_ beds are met with to the south of the Forest of Wyre. The\r\nnatural sequence of formations, and the localities where the several\r\nformations are most conspicuously displayed, are given in the following\r\ntable:--\r\n\r\nTABLE OF THE GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS OF THE BIRMINGHAM DISTRICT.\r\n\r\n  MESOZOIC, OR SECONDARY ROCKS.\r\n\r\n  LIASSIC.\r\n          _Middle Lias_ (_Marlstone_)--Edge Hill, Fenny Compton.\r\n          _Lower Lias Clays_--Harbury, Rugby.\r\n\r\n  RHŒTIC.\r\n          _Marls and White Lias_--Harbury, Knowle, Wooten Wawen.\r\n\r\n  TRIASSIC.\r\n          _Upper Trias or Keuper_:\r\n          (_a_) _New Red Marl_--Moseley, King’s Norton, &c., &c.\r\n          (_b_) _Lower Keuper or Waterstones_--Birmingham, Warwick.\r\n\r\n          _Lower Trias or Bunter_:\r\n          (_a_) _Upper Mottled Sandstone_--Harborne, Edgbaston, Hockley.\r\n          (_b_) _Pebble Beds and Conglomerate_--Sutton Park, Smethwick.\r\n          (_c_) _Lower Mottled Sandstone_--Clent Hills, Stourbridge.\r\n\r\n  PALÆOZOIC, OR PRIMARY ROCKS.\r\n\r\n  PERMIAN, OR DYASSIC.\r\n          (_a_) _Permian Breccia_--Clent Hills, Northfield.\r\n          (_b_) _Red Sandstones and Marls_--Halesowen, Enville, Rubery.\r\n\r\n  CARBONIFEROUS.\r\n          (_a_) _Upper Coal Measures with Spirarks Limestone,\r\n                 &c._--Sandwell, Arley.\r\n          (_b_) _Lower Coal Measures_--Oldbury, Bilston, Hawkesbury.\r\n          (_c_) _Millstone Grit_--Absent near Birmingham, present near\r\n                 Colebrookdale.\r\n          (_d_) _Carboniferous Limestone_--Absent.\r\n\r\n  OLD RED SANDSTONE OR DEVONIAN\r\n          Absent near Birmingham, present in Forest of Wyre.\r\n\r\n  SILURIAN.\r\n          (_a_) _Ludlow Shales and Limestones_--Sedgley Hill.\r\n          (_b_) _Wenlock Shales and Limestone_--Dudley Hill, Wren’s\r\n                 Nest, Walsall.\r\n          (_c_) _Woolhope Beds_--Barr and Rubery.\r\n          (_d_) _Llandovery or Mayhill_--Rubery.\r\n\r\n  ORDOVICIAN.\r\n          Absent.\r\n\r\n  CAMBRIAN.\r\n          _Upper Cambrian_:\r\n          (_a_) _Tremadoc Beds and Lingula Flags._--Shineton, Nuneaton,\r\n                 Lower Lickey, and Malverns.\r\n\r\n  FUNDAMENTAL, CRYSTALLINE AND IGNEOUS ROCKS.\r\n          (_a_) _Charnwood Volcanic Rocks_--Charnwood Forest, Caldecote\r\n                 Hill, The Wrekin.\r\n          (_b_) _Malvern Crystalline Rocks_--North Hill, Hereford\r\n                 Beacon, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL CRYSTALLINE AND VOLCANIC ROCKS OF THE MALVERNS, THE\r\nWREKIN, AND CHARNWOOD FOREST.\r\n\r\nThe rocks which undoubtedly occupy the lowest place in the geological\r\nformations of the Birmingham district are those crystalline and partly\r\nschistose masses which form the core of the Malvern Hills; and certain\r\nwell-marked volcanic rocks which occur at the Wrekin and Nuneaton, and\r\nwhich appear to have their equivalents in the great igneous series of\r\nCharnwood Forest. That all these more or less crystalline rocks are\r\nof higher antiquity than the Upper Cambrian of Wales is demonstrated\r\nby the fact that fossiliferous rocks containing Cambrian fossils of\r\nthis age overlie them, while the lowest recognisable zones of these\r\noverlying fossiliferous rocks (the Hollybush sandstone of the Malverns,\r\nthe quartzite of the Wrekin, and the Hartshill quartzite of the\r\nneighbourhood of Nuneaton) are in part composed of their fragments.\r\nWhether, however, they belong in part to the Middle or Lower Cambrian,\r\nor wholly appertain to the earlier formations of the Archean, must as\r\nyet remain an open question.\r\n\r\n(_a._) MALVERN HILLS.--The core of the Malvern Hills is composed of\r\na coarse syenitic, and more or less gneissose rock, pierced by veins\r\nof quartzo-felspathic rock of igneous origin (Hereford Beacon, &c).\r\nThe main mass which is coarsely crystalline, becomes occasionally\r\ndistinctly gneissose and even schistose, and its mineral bands strike\r\nfrom north-west to south-east, _i.e._, transverse to the general trend\r\nof the Malvern Ridge. The basement beds of the Hollybush sandstones\r\n(Cambrian) and the Llandovery rest unconformably upon this rock, which\r\nhas consequently been claimed by some geologists as distinctly of\r\nArchean age, representing in part the Laurentian of Logan.\r\n\r\nThe best localities for studying the essential characters of the\r\nMalvern rocks are the quarries of the North Hill and the Wych, and the\r\neastern slopes of the hills between Malvern Wells and Herefordshire\r\nBeacon.\r\n\r\n(_b._) THE WREKIN.--The core of the beautiful hill of the Wrekin\r\nis formed by a magnificent series of highly acidic volcanic\r\nrocks--rhyolitic lavas and ashes. As first pointed out by Dr. Callaway,\r\nthey rise out unconformably from below fossiliferous rocks of Upper\r\nCambrian age. (Hollybush Sandstone and Shineton Shales) and are\r\nbelieved by him to be of Archean age. The finest exhibitions of the\r\nvolcanic ashes of the group are met with in quarries on the flanks\r\nof the Wrekin itself, while the rhyolitic lavas occur in scattered\r\nlocalities along the hill. A broad mound of the same igneous series\r\nrises out from below the Triassic to the south of Walcot Station, and\r\na most beautiful and instructive section of banded and spherulitic\r\nrhyolites is shewn in the quarry at the locality known as the Lee Rock.\r\n\r\nThe truly volcanic nature of these remarkable rocks was first pointed\r\nout by Mr. S. Allport, F.G.S., and their original characteristics,\r\nand the changes they have undergone since their formation, have been\r\ndescribed by him in a well-known series of memoirs. Their geological\r\nposition, and their relation to the associated fossiliferous strata,\r\nand to the similar rhyolitic rocks of Caer Caradoc and Pontesbury have\r\nbeen fully discussed by Dr. C. Callaway, F.G.S.\r\n\r\n(_c._) NUNEATON (CALDECOTE HILL).--A thin group of volcanic breccias\r\nand tuffs, with associated quartz-felsites, and diabase, rises out from\r\nbelow the Upper Cambrians of Nuneaton, in the Park of Caldecote Hill.\r\nThe lowest zone of the overlying Cambrian Hartshill quartzite is in\r\npart composed of their fragments. The ashes are shewn in old cuttings\r\nto the north-west of Caldecote Lodge, the quartz-porphyries and diabase\r\nin an old quarry about a quarter of a mile to the southward, while the\r\nbreccia composed of the fragments of these old rocks, in the base of\r\nthe Cambrian quartzite is best shewn on the tramway still farther to\r\nthe southward, leading down to the Coventry Canal.\r\n\r\n(_d._) CHARNWOOD FOREST.--This district is formed of an island of\r\nancient igneous and stratified rocks rising out from below the Upper\r\nTrias. The stratified rocks are almost wholly composed of materials of\r\nvolcanic origin, and shade off on the one hand into coarse volcanic\r\nagglomerates, and on the other into fine green slates like those of the\r\nBorrowdale series in the Lake District, to which indeed the whole of\r\nthe bedded Charnwood rocks bear a striking resemblance.\r\n\r\nThe stratified volcanic rocks are pierced by numerous igneous\r\nintrusions. The most conspicuous are those classed by Professor Bonney,\r\nF.R.S., as syenite. These are most conspicuous near Groby, Bradgate,\r\nand generally in the south eastern parts of the Charnwood area. A mass\r\nof beautiful hornblendic granite rises through the Trias immediately to\r\nthe east of Charnwood Forest at Mount Sorrel, near Barrow on Soar. A\r\nfew later dykes of altered andesite occur within the forest itself, and\r\ndiorite in the outlier of Brazil Wood.\r\n\r\nTo the south of Charnwood Forest, several remarkable points of\r\nsyenitic rock protrude through the flat-lying Trias. The most\r\nconspicuous of these are the hills of Sapcote, Croft, and Enderby.\r\n\r\nThere is no direct evidence of the Cambrian or pre-Cambrian age of\r\nthe Charnwood rocks, but strata identical with the fossiliferous\r\nStockingford shales (Upper Cambrian) of Nuneaton, have been pierced\r\nin several borings through the Trias near Leicester, Market Bosworth,\r\netc., and appear to rest at once upon the Charnwood rocks, as do the\r\nNuneaton beds upon the Caldecote volcanic group.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRIAN ROCKS.\r\n\r\nNo fossiliferous strata unequivocally of Lower Cambrian age occur\r\nwithin the limits of the Birmingham District; but strata of Upper\r\nCambrian age are met with in several localities. They were first\r\nrecognised by Professor Phillips in the area of the Malvern Hills,\r\nand have been subsequently detected within the last few years at the\r\nWrekin, at Nuneaton, and in the Lower Lickey Hills.\r\n\r\nMALVERN HILLS.--The Upper Cambrian beds of the Malverns rest upon\r\nthe crystalline rocks of the axis of the hills to the south of\r\nHerefordshire Beacon, along the slopes of Midsummer Hill and Keys Hill.\r\nThe lowest zone is the _Hollybush Sandstone_, a light green micaceous\r\nrock, containing tubes of sea worms and _Kutorgina cingulata_.\r\n\r\nThe Hollybush Sandstone is succeeded by shivery shales, somewhat sandy\r\nbelow, and becoming darker and more carbonaceous above.\r\n\r\nIn their lower beds they yield:--_Obolella Salteri_, _Obolella\r\nsagittalis_, _Lingula pygmea_, _etc._ In their middle beds they afford\r\n_Pellura scarabeoides_, _Spheropthalmus alatus_, _Agnostis pisiformis_,\r\n_Agnostus trisectus_, etc., well-known fossils of the Upper Lingula\r\nFlags (Dolgelly) of North Wales.\r\n\r\nTheir highest beds contain _Dictyonema sociale_, a fossil which passes\r\nup into the succeeding Tremadoc Slates.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the local succession of the Cambrian rocks is hidden by\r\nthe unconformable overlap of Silurian.\r\n\r\nThe Hollybush Sandstone and the overlying sandy shales contain numerous\r\nintercalated volcanic rocks, some of which are of the age of the\r\nsurrounding strata, while others are intrusive.\r\n\r\nNUNEATON DISTRICT.--In the neighbourhood of the town of Nuneaton in\r\neastern Warwickshire, a strip of Cambrian rocks, about eight miles in\r\nlength by one in breadth, has been detected within the last few years.\r\nThe rocks consist of volcanic ashes, quartzites and thin-bedded shales,\r\npierced by dioritic dykes. These strata were formerly mapped as altered\r\nMillstone Grit and Carboniferous shale, and their Cambrian age has only\r\nbeen recently demonstrated by the discoveries of Birmingham geologists.\r\nThe complete succession is as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1.) CALDECOTE VOLCANIC GROUP.--Well-bedded tuffs and volcanic ashes\r\n(see _ante_) with masses of Quartz-felsites and diabase.\r\n\r\n(2.) HARTSHILL QUARTZITE.--Thick-bedded quartzites, with occasional\r\nlayers of sandy shale.\r\n\r\n(3.) STOCKINGFORD SHALES.--\r\n\r\n(_a._) _Lower Division._--(_Obolella Beds_) Purple and green shales\r\nwith _Obolella Salteri_, _Lingulella pygmea_, _Lingulella lepis_,\r\n_Acrotreta_, _Protospongia_, &c.\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Upper Division._--(_Agnosias Beds_) Grey and black shales\r\nwith _Agnostus pisiformis_. _Beyrichia Angelini_ and _Lingulella\r\nNicholsoni_, in the lower zones, and _Spheropthalmus alatus_ and\r\n_Dictyonema_ in the upper zones.\r\n\r\nThese Cambrian rocks are overlain unconformably by the Coal measures to\r\nthe west, and by the Keuper beds to the east; the boundary of the area\r\nis, however, locally defined by lines of fault.\r\n\r\nThe basement beds of the Hartshill Quartzite are locally composed\r\nof fragments of the underlying volcanic rocks (Caldecote Beds).\r\nThe Quartzite itself, which forms the chief road metal of the\r\nneighbourhood, is laid bare in a long series of quarries between\r\nNuneaton and Hartshill.\r\n\r\nThe overlying purple and green shales of the Stockingford Beds range\r\nfrom Marston Jabet, south of Chilvers Coton to Atherstone Outwoods.\r\nThe best section is seen in Parley Park Lane near Atherstone, and the\r\nfossils have been obtained from this section, from Atherstone Oakwoods,\r\nCamp Hill, and Marston Jabet.\r\n\r\nThe best section of the succeeding grey and black Shales occurs in\r\nthe cutting of the Midland Railway near Stockingford, which gives its\r\nname to the formation. Their fossils have been procured from the rocks\r\nof this section; from the cutting at Chilvers Coton, the banks of the\r\nCoventry Canal, from Oldbury reservoir, Mawbornes and Merevale Park.\r\n\r\nThe numerous intrusive dykes of volcanic rock form a conspicuous\r\nfeature in the geology of these Cambrian strata. They are formed of\r\ncoarse-grained diorites, much quarried for road metal, kerbs, and\r\nsetts. Good sections occur in the quarries near Tuttle Hill, in the\r\nrailway cuttings near Stockingford and Chilvers Coton, and in quarries\r\nnear Oldbury Reservoir.\r\n\r\nA small patch of these Nuneaton Cambrians is met with on the\r\nnorth-western margin of the East Warwickshire coalfield, at Dost Hill,\r\nto the south of Tamworth. It consists of the usual annelide-bearing\r\nStockingford Shales, pierced by an intrusive mass of diorite.\r\n\r\nLOWER LICKEY HILLS.--The core of the Lower Lickey Hills between Barnt\r\nGreen and Rubery, about eight miles south of Birmingham, is formed of\r\na mass of quartzite identical in all its main features with that of\r\nHartshill, near Nuneaton.\r\n\r\nAt the village of Rubery, in an exposure on the roadside, it is seen\r\nto be unconformably overlain by fossiliferous Llandovery sandstone, the\r\nbasement beds of which contain fragments of the underlying quartzite in\r\nabundance. At the south-western extremity of the Lower Lickey Range the\r\nquartzites contain fragments of igneous rocks, and appear to pass down\r\ninto a series of felspathic grits, pierced by dioritic dykes similar\r\nto those of the Nuneaton District. Good sections of the quartzites are\r\nlaid bare at Rubery Station, at the village of Rubery, and in a large\r\nquarry near the roadside, a mile northward from Kendall End. In the\r\nlast-named locality the quartzites are seen greatly folded and faulted.\r\n\r\nWREKIN DISTRICT.--In the Wrekin area the great volcanic series of\r\nthe hills is immediately overlain by a quartzite similar to that of\r\nthe Hartshill and the Lickey, the basement bed similarly containing\r\nfragments of the underlying volcanic rocks. The quartzite is succeeded\r\nby the Hollybush sandstone, with its characteristic fossil, _Kutorgina\r\ncingulata_.\r\n\r\nA broad area, lying between the Hollybush sandstone and the\r\nunconformably overlying Silurian rocks of Buildwas, is occupied by\r\na series of Upper Cambrian rocks, denominated by Dr. Callaway the\r\nShineton Shales, and characterised by the forms:--_Olenus Salteri_,\r\n_Sphæropthalmus_, _Asaphellus Homfrayi_, _&c._, _Bryograptus Callavei_,\r\n_&c._, allying them with the Tremadoc Beds of North Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILURIAN ROCKS.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the Silurian System are fully developed within the limits\r\nof the Birmingham District, under their most typical aspect. The well\r\nknown localities of Dudley and Barr have been famous in the geological\r\nworld since the publication of Murchison’s great work, the Silurian\r\nSystem; and the abundance and beauty of the fossils of the limestone\r\nrocks of the district place it next to the typical area of Central\r\nShropshire as the representative country of the Silurian rocks.\r\n\r\nThe Silurian strata are all of the well-known Salopian type, shewing\r\nseveral thick-bedded limestones, occurring on distinct horizons in a\r\ngreat thickness of dark blue or grey nodular shales and mudstones.\r\nThey make their appearance in sharp anticlinal arches in the South\r\nStaffordshire coalfield, and along its faulted margins. Four of these\r\nexposures occur along the crest of the Lickey-Dudley anticlinal--at\r\nRubery, Dudley Castle Hill, the Wren’s Nest, and Sedgley. The largest\r\ncontinuous exposure is that near the town of Walsall, on the eastern\r\nmargin of the coalfield.\r\n\r\nAll the Silurian formations from the Mayhill Sandstone to the Ludlow\r\n(Aymestry) Limestone are recognisable, but the terminal Downton\r\nsandstone is lost below the unconformably overlying Carboniferous. None\r\nof the localities, however, shew the complete consecutive series, which\r\nis made out by piecing together the sections occurring in the several\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n(1.) LOWER LICKEY HILLS.--\r\n\r\n(_a._) _Landovery or Mayhill Rocks._--The usual red and grey\r\n_Pentamerus_ sandstone of the Mayhill formation is exposed along the\r\nnorth-west flank of the Lower Lickey Hills. It may be seen resting\r\nunconformably upon the Cambrian quartzite in the village of Rubery, and\r\nat Leach Heath. Casts of fossils are abundant in some of the sandstones\r\na few feet above the base of the formation, and include the well\r\nknown forms:--_Pentamerus oblongus_, _Pentamerus lens_, _Strophomena\r\nexpansa_, _Attrypa reticularis_, _etc._--These may be collected from\r\nthe rocks at the village of Rubery, and from the fragments of sandstone\r\nscattered over the fields between the Asylum and Leach Heath.\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Woolhope or Barr Limestone._--The Llandovery sandstone is\r\nfollowed (in a stream section below the Asylum) by pale blue shales and\r\nmudstones containing a bed of hard calcareous rock, affording examples\r\nof _Illenus Barriensis_, _Atrypa reticularis_, _Encrinurus punctatus_,\r\n_Rhynchonella Lewisii_; but the section is a poor one, and is covered\r\nup almost immediately by the overlying Carboniferous.\r\n\r\n(2.) WALSALL AND BARR.--This is the typical area for the well known\r\nBarr Trilobite _Illenus Barriensis_. The quarries of the Woolhope\r\nLimestone which afford it are now disused, but a good section of the\r\nfossiliferous shales above is displayed in the railway cutting between\r\nAldridge and Walsall. The overlying Wenlock or Dudley Limestones\r\nare mined at the town of Walsall itself, but good fossils are now\r\ncomparatively rare.\r\n\r\n(3.) DUDLEY AND THE WREN’S NEST.--By far the most notable and\r\ninteresting of the Silurian exposures are those of the neighbourhood\r\nof Dudley. In the three exposures of Dudley Castle, the Wren’s Nest,\r\nand Sedgley Hill, the Silurian limestone rises up in steep dome-like\r\nforms. This limestone, which is that of the Wenlock of Siluria, is\r\nhere composed of two calcareous bands--the higher about 28 feet in\r\nthickness, and the lower about 42 feet--separated from each other by\r\nan intermediate zone of about 90 feet of gray shales. The limestone\r\nhas been worked for centuries as a flux for the ironstones of the\r\ncoalfield. The hills have been mined to a great depth, and all the\r\nbest limestone rock extracted. The intervening and enveloping shales\r\nhave been allowed to remain, and the present structure of the hills is\r\nthat of a central dome surrounded by two enveloping shells, separated\r\nfrom each other by two more or less empty spaces. Where the dip of the\r\nrock is high, and these excavated parts are exposed, they form deep\r\nmoat-like hollows, bounded by walls of shale. Where the dip is low,\r\nand the overhanging rocks are supported by the vast pillars left by\r\nthe workmen, these excavations form magnificent caverns of peculiar\r\nweirdness and beauty. In the heart of the hill at greater depths they\r\nform damp gloomy chasms of enormous extent, which can only be seen to\r\nperfection when lit up by artificial light.\r\n\r\nThe Dudley limestone bands and the surrounding calcareous shales\r\nhave long been famous for the abundance and beauty of their included\r\nfossils. Many of the type species of Murchison’s Silurian System\r\ncame from this locality; but since the superficial limestones have\r\nbeen worked out, good specimens are exceedingly rare. An excellent\r\ncollection of the fossils of these beds is laid out in the Dudley\r\nMuseum, and another in the Geological Museum of the Mason College. Many\r\ngood collections are in the possession of private individuals in Dudley\r\nand elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe best localities for fossils at present are the shaly slopes on\r\nthe flanks of the Wren’s Nest, where the usual Wenlock Brachiopods and\r\nCorals are abundant, but the beautiful Trilobites of the formation are\r\nbut rarely met with.\r\n\r\nThe Wenlock limestone occurs both in the Dudley Castle Hill and in\r\nthe Wren’s Nest. The Aymestry limestone is only met with in a single\r\nlocality on the flanks of Sedgley Hill, where it yields occasional\r\nspecimens of its characteristic fossil, the _Pentamerus Knightii_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBONIFEROUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\nRocks of Carboniferous age make their appearance at four distinct\r\nlocalities within the limits of the Birmingham District, viz., in the\r\ncoal fields of Coalbrookdale, the Forest of Wyre, South Staffordshire,\r\nand East Warwickshire. The strata exposed on the last three of these\r\ncoalfields are those of the upper Carboniferous or Coal measures;\r\nneither the Carboniferous limestone nor the Millstone grit being met\r\nwith outside the limits of the coalfield of Coalbrookdale.\r\n\r\nIn the Forest of Wyre the Coal measures rest upon the Old Red\r\nSandstone, in the South Staffordshire Coalfield upon the various\r\nmembers of the Silurian, and in the East Warwickshire upon the Upper\r\nCambrian rocks. In these three coalfields a two-fold division of the\r\nCarboniferous is recognisable:--\r\n\r\n(_a._) _The Lower Coal Measures_ proper, consisting of grey sandstones\r\nand shales with occasional coal seams, some of which are of remarkable\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n(_b._) _Upper Coal Measures_, or Halesowen grey and red sandstones,\r\nbrick clays and marls, with occasional coal-seams, none, however, of\r\ncommercial value.\r\n\r\nIn the South Staffordshire and East Warwickshire coalfields, the well\r\nknown “_Spirorbis Limestone_” of the Upper Coal Measures occurs in its\r\nnormal place near the summit of the Carboniferous series.\r\n\r\nSOUTH STAFFORDSHIRE COALFIELD.--The Carboniferous rocks of South\r\nStaffordshire are arranged in a broad dome about 23 miles in length by\r\n6 in breadth. Their basement beds rest unconformably upon the Silurian\r\naround the flanks of the Dudley Hills, and in the neighbourhood of\r\nWalsall. Their highest beds dip conformably below the Permian rocks at\r\nthe southern extremity of the coalfield south of Halesowen, and are\r\noverlapped unconformably by the Triassic pebble beds at its northern\r\nextremity, in the district of Cannock Chase. The eastern and western\r\nboundaries of the coalfield are formed by lines of fault, which have\r\nflung down against the Coal Measures the various members of the Permian\r\nand the Triassic. The total thickness of the Carboniferous beds is\r\nabout 1,300 feet, and the normal succession in the central and highest\r\npart of the coalfield is as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Upper Coal Measures._--\r\n\r\n_2a._ Halesowen Sandstone Group, 600 to 800 feet.\r\n\r\n_2b._ Red Coal Measure Clays.\r\n\r\n_Lower Coal Measures_, 500 to 600 feet, containing several excellent\r\ncoal seams, of which the following are the most important:--\r\n\r\n(_a._) Brooch Coal, 4 feet.\r\n\r\n(_b._) Thick Coal, 30 feet.\r\n\r\n(_c._) Heathen Coal, 3 feet.\r\n\r\n(_d._) New Mine Coal, 2 to 11 feet.\r\n\r\n(_e._) Fire Clay Coal, 1 to 14 feet.\r\n\r\n(_f._) Bottom Coal, five feet and above.\r\n\r\nThese measures include several zones of workable ironstone, of which\r\nthe most important are:--\r\n\r\n(1.) The Pins and Pennyearth ironstones, below the Brooch coal.\r\n\r\n(2.) The Whittery and Gubbin ironstones, below the Thick coal.\r\n\r\n(3.) The Blue Flats, Silver Threads and Diamond Ironstones, below the\r\nBottom coal.\r\n\r\nFor its size the South Staffordshire coalfield has proved itself\r\nthe richest mineral area in Britain. Thick coal seams, rich bands of\r\nironstone, and great thicknesses of Silurian limestone, all occur\r\nwithin a short distance of each other, and all within easy reach of\r\nthe miner. The natural result has been that the South Staffordshire\r\ncoalfield and its immediate neighbourhood has been the great coal and\r\niron mart of Central Britain, and the abundance and cheapness of its\r\nmaterial it has afforded, have rendered Birmingham and the “Black\r\nCountry” the hardware workshop of the world.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the available coal seams and ironstone beds within easy\r\nreach have been long since practically worked out, but there is\r\nstill much excellent coal and iron to be obtained at greater depths,\r\nespecially in the northern part of the coalfield. Of late years the\r\nTriassic rocks which surround the coalfield have been pierced in order\r\nto reach the Coal measures beneath. An entirely new coalfield has been\r\ndeveloped in this manner in the district of Cannock Chase; and two most\r\nremarkable collieries, those of Sandwell Park, and Hamstead, have been\r\nopened in the neighbourhood of Birmingham itself.\r\n\r\nThe area immediately underlain by the Coal measures constitutes the\r\ndistrict of the “Black Country,” which extends from the western margin\r\nof Birmingham to the fringe of Cannock Chase. It includes within its\r\nlimits, the large towns of Dudley, Walsall, Wolverhampton, Bilston, and\r\nothers of scarcely less note.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable seam of the South Staffordshire coalfield is that\r\nknown as the Ten yard or Thick coal, a continuous bed of workable coal\r\nfrom 25 to 30 feet in thickness. This underlies all the south central\r\npart of the field in the area enclosed by Smethwick, Oldbury, Dudley,\r\nWalsall and Bilston. To the southward near Halesowen it thins out\r\nand becomes mixed with shaly material. It is in reality composed of\r\n13 or 14 superimposed coal seams, which form an apparently unbroken\r\nmass, but are easily distinguished individually by the practised\r\nThick coal miner. As we pass northward from the typical Thick coal\r\narea towards Walsall and Cannock Chase, the component seams become\r\nseparated by intercalated sandstones and shales, so that eventually in\r\nthe district of Essington and Pelsall the Thick coal is represented\r\nby 14 distinct coals occurring at intervals in a mass of sandy rock,\r\nbetween 500 and 600 feet in total thickness. The Thick coal is known\r\nto extend far to the eastward, beyond the present margin of the South\r\nStaffordshire coalfield. The first attempt to reach it through the red\r\nground (Permian) was made under the bold and skilful guidance of the\r\nlate Mr. Henry Johnson, C.E., of Dudley, at the locality of Sandwell\r\nPark. The coal was reached in 1873 at a depth of 1,250 feet and found\r\nto be of its original thickness, and of excellent quality. The next\r\nattempt which was made at Hamstead Hall, about three miles outside\r\nthe limit of the coalfield, was even bolder and more hazardous, but\r\nit was eventually crowned with equal success; the Thick coal being\r\nreached at a depth of 1,800 feet. As the demand for coal increases,\r\nother collieries will doubtless be started at fresh localities outside\r\nthe limits of the coalfield, for there can be no question that the\r\nThick coal extends far to the eastward, under and beyond the town of\r\nBirmingham itself.\r\n\r\nThe strata of the South Staffordshire Coalfield afford the usual\r\nfossils of the British Coal Measures. The roofs of the coal seams,\r\nand the layers of carbonaceous shale, locally furnish well preserved\r\nexamples of _Lepidodendron_, _Sigillaria_, _Calamites_, _Annularia_,\r\n_Pecopteris_, _Neuropteris_, etc., often associated with abundant\r\nspecimens of the peculiar _Unio_-like shell, _Anthracosia_: while the\r\nironstone nodules occasionally yield fragmentary _Crustaceans_ and\r\n_Insects_. Marine fossils are principally confined to the lower beds\r\nof the series, below the Thick coal. Owing to the absence of true\r\nlimestone beds in the coalfield, the characteristic corals, &c., of\r\nthe Carboniferous are absent, but the following marine forms are not\r\nuncommon in the lower ironstones:--\r\n\r\n_Lingula elliptica_, _Discina nitida_, _Producta scrabicula_,\r\n_Conularia quadrisulcata_, _Aviculopecten scalaris_, _Gyracanthus\r\nfarmosus_, _Megalichthys Hibberti_, _Pœcilodus angustus_.\r\n\r\nThese have been met with at several localities near Walsall, Oldbury,\r\nOld Hill, Kingswinford, and Oldswinford, etc.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the South Staffordshire coalfield are pierced locally\r\nby sheets of igneous rock. The most important of these is a mass of\r\ndolerite about two miles and a half in length, which caps the long\r\nridge of Rowley Regis. It is traversed by several mining shafts, which\r\npass through the dolerite into the workable coals below. Other igneous\r\nmasses occur near Dudley, and at Pouk Hill, near Walsall.\r\n\r\nTHE EAST WARWICKSHIRE COALFIELD.--The rocks of this coalfield form\r\na narrow strip about 15 miles in length, ranging from Tamworth on\r\nthe north to Bedworth on the South. The coalbearing strata rest\r\nunconformably upon the Cambrian below, and pass up conformably into\r\nthe Permian above. The sequence of the beds is practically identical\r\nwith that of South Staffordshire--the richer coal measures being all\r\nconfined to the lower part of the Carboniferous series, and passing\r\nup through a group of coloured clays into a final group of barren\r\nsandstones. In the north of the coalfield five workable seams of\r\ncoal occur, separated by many feet of barren measures. As they pass\r\nto the southward the intermediate strata thin out, and the coal-beds\r\npractically come together at Hawkesbury to form one Main coal seam, as\r\ndo the corresponding members of the Thick coal of South Staffordshire.\r\nIt is probable that the two coalfields were formed in the same general\r\narea of deposition, and except for the possibility of its destruction\r\nby erosion prior to the deposition of the Triassic, it might be\r\nsuggested with safety that the Thick coal of South Staffordshire\r\nextends in a continuous sheet under the red rocks of Northern\r\nWarwickshire from Smethwick to Hawkesbury.\r\n\r\nFOREST OF WYRE.--Unlike the strata of the other coalfields, the\r\nCarboniferous rocks of the coalfield of the Forest of Wyre are\r\ncomparatively barren of good coal seams. The best, which is locally\r\nknown as the _Main_ coal, is about seven-and a-half feet in thickness,\r\nand occurs at an average depth of 300 feet.\r\n\r\nCOALBROOKDALE.--This coalfield, which lies to the east of the Wrekin,\r\ncovers an area of about 28 square miles. It originally contained about\r\n28 coal seams, but the majority of these are now practically worked\r\nout. The succession includes the Carboniferous limestone, the Millstone\r\ngrit, and the Lower coal-measures in conformable sequence. The Upper\r\ncoal-measures rest in a hollow eroded out of the Lower coal-measures\r\nbeneath, forming what is locally known as the “Symon Fault.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPERMIAN OR DYASSIC.\r\n\r\nThe Permian rocks of the Birmingham District are totally distinct\r\nin their petrological characters from those of the typical area of\r\nYorkshire and Durham. No true limestones are present, and the formation\r\nis wholly made up of red sandstones, marls and beds of angular breccia.\r\n\r\nThe lowest zones of the Permian repose conformably upon the Upper\r\nCoal Measures of the South Staffordshire Coalfield in the slopes\r\nof the hills to the south of Halesowen, and its strata are seen\r\nin corresponding relation to the Carboniferous on the east of the\r\nCoalfields of the Forest of Wyre and Coalbrookdale, and to the west of\r\nthe Coalfield of Eastern Warwickshire.\r\n\r\nThe Permian is everywhere covered up unconformably, or locally\r\noverlapped, by the various members of the Triassic formation; all the\r\nsubdivisions of the Triassic series being found resting immediately\r\nupon it in turns as they are followed from the valley of the Severn to\r\nthe neighbourhood of Charnwood Forest.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Enville and the Forest of Wyre, three divisions\r\nare recognisable in the Permian, viz.:--\r\n\r\n(1.) _Lower Red Sandstones and Marls_, with bands of calcareous\r\nconglomerate.\r\n\r\n(2.) _Coarse Breccia._\r\n\r\n(3.) _Upper Red Sandstones and Marls._\r\n\r\nRound the South Staffordshire Coalfield the Breccia is the highest\r\ndivision exposed, and this only occurs in force to the south of the\r\ncoalfield.\r\n\r\nBetween Tamworth and Kenilworth, to the east of Birmingham, the Permian\r\nstrata floor a wide tract of country, and lie almost horizontal. Red\r\nsandstones, marls and beds of breccia occur in association, but the\r\ndivisions named above are not individually recognisable.\r\n\r\nBy far the most striking local member of the Permian formation is\r\nthe so-called _Volcanic or Permian Breccia_. It is found in scattered\r\npatches over an area of about 500 square miles, extending from the\r\nMalverns to Enville, Stourbridge, and the Lickey Hills. It is made up\r\nof angular fragments of volcanic rocks, tuffs, altered shales, grits,\r\nand slabs of fossiliferous sandstone and limestones, all embedded\r\nin paste of bright red marl or pebbly sandstone. It is usually both\r\nunderlain and overlain by red sandstones and marls, but sometimes, as\r\nat Stagbury and Woodbury Hills, &c., in the Valley of the Severn, it\r\nreposes at once upon pre-Permian rock.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar Breccia is well displayed in the Clent Hills, between\r\nHagley and Halesowen. It there reposes upon the Lower Permian\r\nSandstones with calcareous grit bands--(which may be seen above the\r\nlittle Church of St. Kenelm)--and forms all the highest points of the\r\nClent Hills, passing unconformably to the southward under the pebble\r\nbeds of the New Red Sandstone. In this locality the angular fragments\r\ncomposing the Breccia are mainly volcanic:--rhyolites, porphyrites,\r\nashes, and volcanic grits, embedded in a coarse matrix formed of\r\nsimilar materials. Other sections are seen in the Bromsgrove Lickey\r\nHills, and in the neighbourhood of Northfield. In the last-named\r\nlocality an excellent section is exposed in a lane leading from the\r\nBell Inn to Bangham Pit. In this exposure the breccia, which shows\r\nthe usual preponderance of volcanic materials, contains in addition\r\nfragments of Silurian limestone (crowded with characteristic fossils),\r\nand pieces of Landovery grit and shale.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir Andrew Ramsay,[60] this Permian breccia is probably\r\nof glacial origin, its materials having been brought down by ice\r\nin Permian times from the neighbourhood of the Longmynd in central\r\nShropshire, where all the formations represented in its derived rock\r\nfragments occur at present in natural juxtaposition. According to\r\nProfessor Jukes,[61] the fragments of the Northfield breccia, at any\r\nrate, “may have been derived from adjacent rocks, now concealed under\r\nthe Permian and New Red Sandstone.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Triassic Rocks.\r\n\r\nBY W. JEROME HARRISON, F.G.S.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the Midland Counties of England is composed\r\nof red sandstones and marls. The town of Birmingham stands upon, and is\r\nsurrounded by rocks of this character. They form the Triassic System of\r\ngeologists, the first of the four grand members of the Mesozoic series.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, the title _Trias_ is a misnomer as applied to the\r\nEnglish development of the rocks of this system. The central member\r\nof the typical German succession, the _Muschelkalk_, is wanting in\r\nBritain; and only the upper and lower divisions, the so-called Keuper\r\nand Bunter, are represented. The _Bunter_ or lower Trias, consists in\r\nthe Midland areas of a mass of pebble beds or conglomerate, usually\r\nunderlain and overlain by variegated sandstones. The _Keuper_ is formed\r\nof a great thickness of red marly strata, with a thick sandstone\r\n(_Waterstones_) at the base.\r\n\r\nThe following table shews the subdivisions of the Trias which have been\r\nrecognised in England, together with (_a_) their maximum thickness, and\r\n(_b_) their thickness in the neighbourhood of Birmingham.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE TRIASSIC STRATA--\r\n\r\n                                     Thickness    Thickness near\r\n                                    in Cheshire.    Birmingham.\r\n                                       Feet.           Feet.\r\n  KEUPER RED MARLS (with the Upper\r\n      Keuper Sandstone) f. 6.         3,000             700\r\n  LOWER KEUPER SANDSTONE, f. 5.         450             200\r\n  _Muschelkalk_                        (wanting in England).\r\n  UPPER MOTTLED SANDSTONE, f. 3.        500             200\r\n  PEBBLE BEDS, _or Bunter\r\n      Conglomerate_, f. 2.              600             400\r\n  LOWER MOTTLED SANDSTONE, f. 1.        400        (wanting.)\r\n\r\nThe Trias enters England on the south coast, between Torbay and\r\nExmouth. At the little watering-place of Budleigh Salterton there is a\r\nbed of quartzite pebbles in the Trias 100 feet thick which is worthy\r\nof study in connection with the great numbers of similar pebbles that\r\noccur in the same strata round Birmingham. In West Somerset and Devon,\r\nthe Triassic strata are 3,500 feet in thickness. Their subdivisions\r\ncannot be correlated with those of the Midlands, for they appear to\r\nhave been deposited in a separate basin, of which the Mendips, &c.,\r\nstill mark the northern boundary.\r\n\r\nCrossing into Gloucestershire, we find the vale of the Severn composed\r\nof Triassic marls, and thence northwards the “red rocks” broaden till\r\nthey form the plains of Cheshire and South Lancashire on the west,\r\nand extend eastward to Warwick, Leicester, and Derby. From this great\r\ncentral plain of our island a long strip of Triassic sandstones and\r\nmarls runs northwards, forming the Vale of Trent and the Vale of York,\r\nuntil finally it reaches the coast between Redcar and Hartlepool. Along\r\nthe main line of outcrop--from the Malvern Hills to the mouth of the\r\nTees--the Triassic strata incline gently, or dip, to the south-east, at\r\nfrom two to five degrees.\r\n\r\nOf the two great divisions of the Trias, the lower (Bunter) is mainly\r\nsandy; while the upper (Keuper) is chiefly a stiff marl or clay. One\r\nresult of this is that while the outcrop of the former is usually\r\nbarren, forming much heath or waste land, as Sherwood Forest, the\r\nKeuper marls produce a rich soil, well fitted for the plough.\r\n\r\nOwing to the soft nature of the strata, valleys are usually hollowed\r\nout in the Lower and Upper Mottled Sandstones, while the Keuper marls\r\nform an undulating plain. On the other hand the harder nature of the\r\nBunter pebble bed, and the Lower Keuper Sandstone, causes these two\r\nrocks to form escarpments or lines of hills, parallel to each other;\r\nthe abrupt face generally looking west or north-west, while the gentle\r\nslope is to the east or south-east, agreeing with the average dip.\r\n\r\nTHE LOWER RED AND MOTTLED SANDSTONE.--Round Bridgenorth this division\r\nrests unconformably on Permian strata, and is about 650 feet thick. It\r\nis a homogeneous sandstone, of reddish-brown, yellow, and bright red\r\ncolours, entirely devoid of pebbles. As we follow this stratum to the\r\neast it decreases in thickness, being only 200 feet near Stourbridge.\r\nEast of the South Staffordshire field, the Lower Mottled Sandstone is\r\nentirely absent, and the Bunter pebble beds repose directly upon the\r\nPermian rocks. Geologists desirous of examining the “Lower Mottled”\r\nshould visit Kinver Edge, west of Stourbridge, where this rock is well\r\nseen underlying the Bunter conglomerate. Its upper portion has here\r\nbeen hardened by calcareous matter, and projects beyond the pebble\r\nbeds above. Caves, or “rock-houses,” have been excavated in the Edge,\r\nand in a detached mass of sandstone called the Holy Austen Rock. The\r\nLower Mottled Sandstone is again visible on Whittington Common, between\r\nKinver and Stourbridge. It is everywhere quite unfossiliferous. “False\r\nbedding” is especially characteristic of this division, but it is\r\ncommon in all the Midland Triassic sandstones.\r\n\r\nTHE BUNTER CONGLOMERATE OR PEBBLE-BED occupies the surface of the\r\nBirmingham area, along a line running from south-west to north-east.\r\nIt extends from Worcester, by Bridgnorth, Stourbridge, Cannock\r\nChase, and Sutton Park to Lichfield. At all these places it is seen\r\nas a remarkable mass of rounded pebbles--mostly yellow, brown, or\r\nliver-coloured quartzites--and attains a thickness of 300 feet at\r\nCannock Chase. West of Stourbridge the Conglomerate forms the “Ridge,”\r\nand caps Kinver Edge, dipping east or south-east at from five to eight\r\ndegrees. Thence it is traceable northward by Upper Penn and Bushbury to\r\nCannock Chase, where it forms a wide undulating heathy moorland, six\r\nmiles in breadth from Bednall on the west to Rugeley on the east, and\r\nis exposed in many gravel pits and other excavations. The Staffordshire\r\nCoalfield lies like a great wedge between the Trias on its western and\r\neastern sides. Crossing over from Stourbridge, we again find the Bunter\r\nConglomerate or Pebble-beds extending between Harborne and Smethwick,\r\nand thence it runs northward in a broad band across the western suburbs\r\nof Birmingham, by Winson Green, Handsworth, Perry Barr, and Perry, to\r\nSutton Park (where its outcrop is 3½ miles wide), and on to Aldridge,\r\nWreford, Hopwas Wood, and Lichfield Racecourse. All along this line\r\nthe Pebble-beds rest on Permian marls, and their thickness at Barr\r\nBeacon is about 400 feet. Good sections of the pebble-beds are rare on\r\nthe south-west or west of Birmingham, but in the north-west they are\r\nwell seen in a quarry south of Great Barr Station, and in one or two\r\nsections near the Beacon. At Sutton, exposures along the new railway\r\nlines to Lichfield and to Walsall have been numerous and good, and the\r\nQuarry in the Park, close to Blackroot Pool, gives a vertical section\r\nof thirty feet. Each section shows a mass of well-rounded hard pebbles,\r\nwhich have been so pressed together during the earth-movements that\r\nhave taken place since their deposition that many are cracked, while\r\nall bear white indentations. The Bunter Conglomerate contains no\r\nfossils of contemporaneous age, but many species of shells have been\r\nobtained from the hard, rounded lumps of rock of which it is composed.\r\nThese fossils being of necessity of the age of the rock-fragments in\r\nwhich they are included, they furnish a clue to the sources from which\r\nthe pebble-beds were derived. The following list of these derivative\r\nfossils will give some idea of the results which have already been\r\nobtained:--\r\n\r\n    ORDOVICIAN (in quartzite pebbles).--(_Arenig Beds._) _Lingula\r\n    Lesueurii._ (This interesting brachiopod shell has not yet been\r\n    found in its parent rock in England, though it is not uncommon\r\n    in the _Gres Armoricain_ of Brittany, a quartzite on the same\r\n    horizon as the Stiper stones); various lamellibranchs such as\r\n    _Modiolopsis_, _Palaearca_, and _Lyrodesma_ occur.\r\n\r\n    (_Caradoc and Bala Beds._)--Seven or eight species of\r\n    brachiopods, of which the commonest is _Orthis Budleighensis_;\r\n    a crinoid (_Glyptocrinus basalis_), &c.\r\n\r\n    (_May Hill Sandstone._)--Lumps of coarse sandstone, identical\r\n    lithologically with the rock which flanks the Lickey Hills,\r\n    occur commonly; they contain numerous casts of _Stricklandinia\r\n    lirata_, &c.\r\n\r\n    DEVONIAN.--Nine or ten species of brachiopods (especially\r\n    _Spirifera Verneuilii_). Remains of trilobites, such as\r\n    _Phacops_ and _Homalonotus_ are not unfrequent.\r\n\r\n    MOUNTAIN LIMESTONE.--Mr. Molyneux enumerates twenty-two species\r\n    of mountain limestone fossils--brachiopods, corals, crinoids,\r\n    &c.--which he obtained from the Bunter pebble-beds of Trentham.\r\n    Near Birmingham, fragments of partly decomposed chert, in which\r\n    the stems of crinoids are beautifully shown, are common in the\r\n    same strata.\r\n\r\nTHE UPPER RED AND MOTTLED SANDSTONE.--Stourbridge stands on the bright\r\nred sands of this division, which extend northward through Kingswinford\r\nto Trysall and Tettenhall. South of Birmingham we find the same strata\r\nat Harborne Heath and Mill--there is a good exposure underneath the\r\ndrift in Flavel’s brick pit at “California”--from which point we can\r\ntrace the “Upper Mottled” across the western part of Birmingham, by\r\nRotton Park Reservoir and the Botanical Gardens; the beautiful soft red\r\nsandstone forming a strip about a mile in width between Spring Hill,\r\nHockley Brook, Aston Villa, and Birchfields on the west, to the foot of\r\nSnow Hill, and Aston Park on the east. In the cemetery adjoining the\r\nGreat Western Station at Hockley, there is a grand section, forty feet\r\nin height, where the incoherent sand is largely worked for moulding and\r\nfoundry purposes. It is also exposed in and round Aston Park.\r\n\r\nTHE LOWER KEUPER SANDSTONE.--The lower member of the Keuper is the most\r\nconsolidated part of the Triassic formation, being best known as a\r\ntolerably hard sandstone, white or pink in colour, which often yields\r\ngood building stone.\r\n\r\nThe “basement beds” of the Keuper are certain coarse sandstones and\r\nchocolate coloured marls seen in a pit at “California,” near Harborne.\r\nAbove these come massively-bedded sandstones, of which there is a good\r\nexposure in the now disused quarry at Weoley Castle.\r\n\r\nCommencing at Edgbaston, we can trace the Lower Keuper Sandstone\r\nby the Five Ways, and across the central highest part of Birmingham\r\nto Nechells, Gravelly Hill, and Erdington. Its lower boundary line,\r\nwhere it reposes on the Bunter, may be indicated by a line drawn\r\nfrom the junction of Monument Road with Hagley Road to the bottom of\r\nSnow Hill, and thence to Aston Station. From this point it extends\r\neastward, for from one mile (Edgbaston) to half-a-mile (Aston). The\r\nridge on which stands the Town Hall, St. Philip’s Church, &c., (475\r\nfeet above sea-level) is formed by the Lower Keuper Sandstone, and\r\ndeep excavations for foundations in the centre of the town, frequently\r\ndisclose the thin-bedded, dull-coloured, pinkish sandstones (known\r\nto workmen as “skerry”) which constitute the upper portion of this\r\nrock. Its thickness under Birmingham may be estimated at 200 feet. The\r\naverage dip is from three to five degrees south-east. Similar beds are\r\nexposed in the cutting at Bromsgrove Railway Station, and it was from a\r\nquarry here (now closed) that the remarkable fossil fish was obtained,\r\nwhich was described by Sir Philip Egerton as _Dipteronotus cyphus_.\r\nFrom quarries at Coton End, Guy’s Cliff, Cubbington and Blakedown Hill,\r\nnear Warwick, bones and teeth of four species of the _Labyrinthodon_\r\nhave been obtained, and foot-prints of the same creature have been\r\nfound in the Lower Keuper Sandstone in many localities.\r\n\r\nTHE KEUPER RED MARL is the uppermost member of the Trias. Near\r\nBirmingham it is abruptly separated from the Lower Keuper Sandstone\r\nby a line of _fault_, which can be traced from Selly Oak northwards\r\nto the junction of the Rea with the Tame. East of this line of fault,\r\nthe red marls extend for ten or twelve miles forming an undulating\r\nfertile plain, on which stand Moseley, Smallheath, and Castle\r\nBromwich, Coleshill and Whitacre. The thickness of the Keuper Marls is\r\nconsiderable. A boring in Smallheath Park was made to a depth of 440\r\nfeet entirely in such strata; but quite lately another boring at King’s\r\nHeath has been continued to a depth of 700 feet. Gypsum is plentiful in\r\nthe red marls, occurring in white fibrous layers, but not of sufficient\r\nthickness to be of any value in this district. At Droitwich (eighteen\r\nmiles south-west of Birmingham) the Keuper Marls contain a thick bed of\r\nrock salt, which yields an inexhaustible supply of _brine_.\r\n\r\n_The Upper Keuper Sandstone_ is a thin band of sandstone, not exceeding\r\nthirty feet in thickness, which occurs irregularly in the upper part\r\nof the Keuper Marls. It is well exposed at the entrance to the canal\r\ntunnel at Shrewley Common, and in a small quarry at Rowington (thirteen\r\nmiles south-east of Birmingham), and also crops out on the hill sides\r\nat many points in South Warwickshire. From this thin stratum, the\r\nRev. P. B. Brodie, F.G.S., has obtained a fossil fish (_Palæoniscus\r\nsuperstes_), and the crustacean (_Estheria minuta_). Specimens of these\r\nmay be seen in the Warwick Museum, which contains the finest collection\r\nof Triassic fossils possessed by any provincial museum.\r\n\r\nHOW THE TRIASSIC ROCKS WERE FORMED.--According to the writer’s views,\r\nthe area now occupied by central England, alternated in condition\r\nduring the Carboniferous epoch, between a low plain and a shallow\r\nsea. In the Permian period, land conditions prevailed, except in the\r\nNorth and North Midland Counties, where a brackish sea somewhat like\r\nthe Baltic, it may be--occupied a shallow depression. In Triassic\r\ntimes this central sea appears to have been completely cut off from\r\nthe open ocean, and to have formed a large inland lake, comparable\r\nto the Caspian or the Dead Sea of our own day. The southern boundary\r\nof this inland sea was formed by a ridge of old rocks which extended\r\nfrom Charnwood by Hartshill and the Lickey to the Wrekin and Malvern\r\nHills. In the basin north of this axial ridge, all the subdivisions\r\nof the Bunter and the Keuper were in turn deposited; and the cliffs\r\nand reefs of the Palæozoic rocks of which this coastline was composed,\r\nyielded large contributions to the pebble-beds, sands and marls, which\r\nconstitute the Trias. According to a theory originally advanced by\r\nProfessor Hull, and ably supported by Professor Bonney, the pebbles of\r\nthe Bunter were mainly derived from the Paleozoic Rocks of the N.W.\r\nand N.E., some being possibly furnished by the ancient strata of N.W.\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the Triassic sea were so overcharged with salts of iron,\r\nthat every grain of sand was encrusted, before its deposition, with a\r\npellicle of peroxide of iron: of chloride of sodium (common salt) and\r\nsulphate of sodium (gypsum), there was also an excess, so that much was\r\ndeposited on the sea-floor, producing beds of rock-salt and of gypsum,\r\nof considerable thickness. The presence of these mineral substances in\r\nthe water was prejudicial to life, so that--as in the Dead Sea, and in\r\nLake Utah to-day--few living creatures could inhabit the Triassic sea,\r\nand fossils are consequently of extreme rarity in strata of this age.\r\n\r\n_The Trias as a source of Water Supply._--The Triassic strata are\r\nso porous, that they absorb a large proportion of the rain which\r\nfalls upon them, and they consequently form an underground reservoir\r\nwhich, when tapped by wells or boreholes, is capable of yielding an\r\nalmost inexhaustible supply of good, though somewhat hard water. In\r\nthis way Birmingham receives three-fourths of its water from three\r\ndeep wells--two on the north-east of the town, at Aston and at Perry\r\nrespectively, and one on the south-west, near Selly Oak. These wells\r\nextend to depths of 400 feet, passing through the Upper Mottled\r\nSandstone, and piercing the pebble beds, and the average supply of\r\nwater from each is three million gallons per day. The hardness varies\r\nfrom nine to fifteen degrees. There are many other deep wells in and\r\nround the West of Birmingham, and at Stourbridge, Wolverhampton, etc.,\r\nwhich derive their water from the same source.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiassic and Rhætic.\r\n\r\nBY REV. P. B. BRODIE, M.A., F.G.S.\r\n\r\nThe Lias occupies a large area in the south and east of the Birmingham\r\nDistrict, and consists for the most part of the middle and lower\r\ndivisions. The highest position of the Lias is seen on the south and\r\nsouth-eastern division of Warwickshire, the middle Lias forms the hills\r\nprojecting in spurs to the north-west, and the lower division extending\r\nin the same direction, at a lower level, up to the southern edge of the\r\nTrias.\r\n\r\nUPPER LIAS.--The Upper Lias is chiefly represented by a thin bed of\r\nclay, with some characteristic fossils. It occurs on the hills of Fenny\r\nCompton and elsewhere, and there is evidence to show that it formerly\r\ncapped the range of the Edge Hills adjacent, occupying its natural\r\nposition above the marlstone, or Middle Lias, of which they are mainly\r\ncomposed. From Fenny Compton to Harbury, a good descending section may\r\nbe obtained from the marlstone (rock bed), through the underlying clays\r\nand marly beds, through the “Lima Beds” and White Lias, to the New Red\r\nMarls at Harbury.\r\n\r\nMARLSTONE OR MIDDLE LIAS.--The Marlstone (rock bed) is largely\r\nquarried on the Avon and Burton Dassett Hills. It forms a good\r\nbuilding stone, more or less indurated, of a green or yellow brown\r\ncolour, sometimes ferruginous. It forms a conspicuous range of hills\r\nof moderate height of which Edge Hill is the highest, from which it\r\nstrikes southward towards Oxfordshire. The plain below is occupied\r\nby the underlying division of the Lower Lias. In this county the\r\nmarlstone contains very few fossils, and those chiefly brachiopodous\r\nshells belonging to the genus _Terebratula_. In most cases elsewhere\r\nthe Marlstone proper, or highest zone, is very fossiliferous, and\r\nabounds in marine shells, which are usually well preserved. The sandy\r\nbeds immediately below are rarely exposed, but crop out in a lane near\r\nBitham House, where as usual they contain many fossils. The inferior\r\nclays and marls are not visible except in some brick pits near Fenny\r\nCompton and along the line of railway. These are very full of fossils\r\nin the zone of _Ammonites Jamiesoni_ and _Ibex_, here nearly one\r\nhundred feet thick, and especially at one horizon in a coarse, hard,\r\nstony band which contains numerous corals towards the upper part of the\r\ncutting, near the station.\r\n\r\nLOWER LIAS.--For the most part this formation spreads over the\r\nportion of the country on the north-east, east, south-east, south\r\nand south-west of Warwick. A remarkably fine section is exposed in\r\nthe railway cutting near Harbury Station. This portion of the series\r\nis also largely quarried at Rugby, and in other places south and\r\nsouth-east of Stratford. The strata consist of beds of blue clay\r\nor shale interstratified with beds of blue rubbly and argillaceous\r\nlimestone, much quarried for hydraulic lime. One good section of the\r\nlime-yielding beds occurs at Messrs. Greaves and Lakin’s Quarries at\r\nStockton and Harbury. The lowest zones of the Lias are largely quarried\r\nat Wilmcote, and may be seen at the remarkable outlier of Brown’s Wood,\r\nnear Henley-in-Arden, and at another (Copt Heath), near Knowle. These\r\ntwo last are of special interest, because they shew the lowest beds of\r\nthe Lias (in connection with and passing into the Rhætics,) resting\r\nimmediately upon the New Red Marls. The thickness of the Lower Lias in\r\nthe county is above 600 feet; but only the inferior zones of _Ammonites\r\nangulatus_ and _A. planorbis_ are laid open to any great extent. The\r\nbest sections of the _Lima_ beds (_A. angulatus_ zone) occur in the\r\nrailway cutting at Harbury, Stockton lime quarries, and the extensive\r\nquarries at Newbold near Rugby. Fossils are not very numerous, but\r\nthe following occur:--_Gryphea incurva_, _Rhynchonella variabilis_,\r\n_Ammonites angulatus_, _Pecten_, various species, _Lima gigantea_,\r\nand bones and teeth of _Plesiosaurus_ and _Ichthyosaurus_. Fish are\r\ncomparatively rare, two or three only were found at Harbury and a very\r\nfew near Rugby.\r\n\r\nThe higher ground round Wilmcote and Binton is also capped by\r\nthese Lima beds; but the district is more or less affected by small\r\nfaults, so that certain beds in one contiguous quarry are absent in\r\nanother. The lower limestones (insect beds) are largely worked in this\r\nlocality, and are of much economical value. With the exception of\r\nremains of insects and fragments of plants, the fossils are entirely\r\nmarine, _Ammonites planorbis_ and _A. Johnstoni_, being abundant\r\nand characteristic. Crustacea belonging to the genera _Astacus_ and\r\n_Eryon_, the latter of great size are not unfrequently met with.\r\nSmall fishes, _Pholidophorus Stricklandi_, and the larger _Dapedium_\r\nand _Tetragonolepis_ more rarely occur. A fine example of the latter\r\nis preserved in the Warwick Museum. The large _Enaliosaurians_ are\r\nwell represented by some fine specimens of _Ichthyosaurus_ and\r\n_Plesiosaurus_; the _P. megacephalus_ in the Museum at Warwick being\r\nnearly entire, measuring 14 feet 4 inches in length. Large masses\r\nof driftwood and a few fronds of ferns are sometimes met with. But\r\nperhaps the most interesting and remarkable fossils are the insects.\r\nTwenty-four families and genera were determined more than twenty years\r\nago, since which time many important additions have been made. The\r\n_Coleoptera_ and _Neuroptera_ are most numerous. Small beetles are\r\nnot unfrequently found entire. Among these may be noted the families\r\n_Buprestidæ_, _Elateridæ_, _Carabidæ_, and others.\r\n\r\nThere are also remains of _Orthoptera_, _Homoptera_, _Libellulidæ_, and\r\nsome _Diptera_. Many of the _Neuroptera_ were evidently of gigantic\r\nproportions, but most of the insects were of small size, and like the\r\nassociated plants, are indicative of a temperate climate. They are most\r\nnearly allied to forms which now inhabit North America. There are few\r\nextinct or unknown genera among them.\r\n\r\nRHÆTIC SERIES.--The highest beds referred to this series consist of\r\ncertain hard, fine grained limestones, which, from their ordinary white\r\ncolour, have been termed _White Lias_. They occupy a considerable\r\narea south and south-east of Warwick. They constitute a purely local\r\ndeposit, and are confined for the most part to this county and\r\nSomersetshire. They are often close-grained and hard limestones, and\r\nmake a useful building material and a good lime. Their colour is mostly\r\nwhite, with a yellow tinge, and occasionally pink and grey. Some\r\ngeologists consider these beds to belong to the “Rhætic Series,” others\r\nto the passage beds between the Lias and the latter, while others still\r\nclass them with the Lias.\r\n\r\nThe undisputed Rhætic rocks lie between the White Lias and the\r\nTriassic Marls. In Warwickshire they are rarely exposed, and then much\r\nreduced in bulk, compared with their development in Gloucester and\r\nGlamorgan. They may be seen to a limited extent below the White Lias\r\nin the railway cutting at Harbury, where a band of yellowish sandstone\r\ncontains the small bivalved crustacean, _Estheria minuta_; and also at\r\nthe small outlier of Brown’s Wood, and at Stooper’s Wood, near Wooton\r\nWawen, where this sandstone occurs with inferior shelly limestones and\r\nsandy bands, containing the usual Rhætic fossils, _e.g._, _Cardium\r\nRhæticum_, _Avicula contorta_, _Pleurophorus elongatus_, _Pecten\r\nvaloniensis_, and _Schizodus cloacinus_. The nearest exposure of the\r\nRhætic to Birmingham occurs round the fringe of an outlier of Lower\r\nLias resting on the Upper Red Marl near the village of Knowle. This\r\noutlier is about a mile and a half long, by half a mile broad. Its\r\nhighest beds at Copt Heath contain _Ammonites planorbis_. The beds\r\nreferred to the Rhætic include a stratum of yellow micaceous sandstone\r\nfull of _Schizodus cloacinus_, which, though usually in the form\r\nof casts, is sharp and well defined. The bone bed, though no where\r\nexposed, is probably present in its normal position. A fine section,\r\nwith numerous characteristic Rhætic fossils was exposed on the railway\r\ncutting at Summer Hill, between Stratford and Alcester. Rhætic black\r\nshales were passed through at Snitterfield, in making a tunnel in\r\nconnection with the new reservoir for Stratford.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlacial and Post Tertiary Deposits.\r\n\r\nBY H. W. CROSSKEY, LL.D., F.G.S.\r\n\r\nPost Tertiary Deposits are scattered profusely over the district\r\nof which Birmingham is the centre, and present many problems of\r\ntoo complicated a character to be discussed in the pages of this\r\nguide. It must suffice to indicate a few of their chief exposures\r\nand characteristics. The term “_Boulder Clay_” is used in this note\r\nto denote a clay shown to be connected with the Glacial epoch, by\r\ncontaining a greater or less number of erratic blocks; and in the\r\nemployment of the term, no theory regarding the method of formation of\r\nthe deposit will be implied.\r\n\r\nThe Post Tertiary deposits of the district may be arranged in the\r\nfollowing general order:--\r\n\r\nI.--Lower boulder clays.\r\n\r\nII.--Middle glacial clays, sands, and gravels.\r\n\r\nIII.--Upper boulder clays.\r\n\r\nIV.--Post glacial clay, sands, and gravels.\r\n\r\nThe most complete section that has been found is at “California,” near\r\nHarborne.\r\n\r\nResting upon the Bunter Sandstone, about 480 feet above the sea level,\r\nis a _Lower boulder clay_, containing erratic boulders of slate,\r\nfelsite, quartzite, intermixed with blocks and stones of local origin.\r\nMany of the erratics are angular, and some (especially the slates) are\r\nfinely striated. The whole deposit is unstratified and compact, and the\r\nboulders are roughly pressed together, in every variety of position,\r\nwithout any orderly arrangement. This boulder clay is succeeded by the\r\n_Middle Sands and Gravels_ which are irregularly stratified and show\r\nfalse bedding. Fragments of coal occur among the pebbles. The sands\r\nand gravels dip rapidly to the S.W., and pass under an Upper boulder\r\nclay. _The Upper Boulder Clay_ consists of a compact mass of clay with\r\nerratics scattered through it; but the erratics are neither so abundant\r\nnor so confusedly pressed together as in the lower bed. Granite has\r\nbeen found, although rarely, associated with the travelled felsites and\r\nquartzites, together with a few flints; and local stones and blocks\r\nare also mixed up with the clay--the clay itself however largely\r\npreponderating and being available for brick making.\r\n\r\nThe series is capped by a mixture of clay, sand, and gravel in\r\nvarying proportions, which fills many hollows that have been washed\r\nout of the upper clay; and must be regarded as Post Glacial. Taking\r\nthe general divisions indicated by the California section, attention\r\nmay be directed to the following illustrative facts and sections.\r\nGlacial striæ upon the surface of the rock have been noticed at Weoley\r\nHill Quarry close to California. The removal of a mass of clay, sand,\r\nand gravel exposed a distinctly striated surface of hardened Bunter\r\nSandstone. The polished surface dips towards the south west, in which\r\ndirection the principal striæ run, although there are several cross\r\nstriæ. The complete section shews (_a_) striated and polished Bunter\r\n(altitude 520 feet above sea level); (_b_) thin bed of marl; (_c_)\r\nsands and gravels (Middle Glacial); (_d_) clay (Upper Boulder Clay).\r\n\r\nA very large number of well-marked and finely smoothed and polished\r\ngrooves occur upon the blocks of native rock which are strewn over\r\nthe irregularly shaped mass of basalt constituting Rowley Hill,\r\nWorcestershire. Isolated grooved blocks rest upon the surface of\r\nthe hill, having been carried by external force into their present\r\nposition; but there is also, at Rowley Hall Quarry, a kind of platform,\r\ncapping the solid mass of basalt, which is almost entirely composed of\r\nblocks with smoothed and grooved surfaces, stiffly imbedded in clay.\r\n\r\nThe question has been raised whether, since the basalt readily\r\ndevelops joints, these grooves may not be rudimentary joints, or\r\nwhether disintegration may not have taken place along certain lines\r\nwhich have gradually become grooves. I entertain no doubt, however,\r\nof their glacial origin. No other explanation than that the grooves\r\nwere the work of moving ice can account, I think, for their excellent\r\npolish, their frequent parallelism, their adaptation to the hollows and\r\nprotuberances of the blocks they cross, and their predominant trend\r\nfrom north-east to south-west. The absence of erratics from the boulder\r\nclay in which the grooved basaltic blocks are embedded is evidence of\r\nlocal ice action at Rowley Hill. It is notable also that angular blocks\r\nof basalt from Rowley Hill have been found in Birmingham, blocks which\r\nmust have travelled at least six miles.\r\n\r\nIt is often difficult to decide the precise age of the boulder clays\r\nof the district; and whether any individual bed is referred to the\r\nupper or the lower series is more dependent upon the glacial theories\r\nthat may be adopted than upon any observations that can be made in\r\nthe field. A _Boulder Clay_, of a typical kind, has been exposed at\r\na brickyard, at the bottom of Oak Street, Wolverhampton. This clay\r\ncontains an extraordinary number and variety of erratic blocks, without\r\nquestion from the Lake District and south of Scotland, a few flints,\r\ntogether with pebbles from the Bunter beds. One of the sides of a\r\nboulder of felsite, measuring 11 × 3 × 3ft., is flat and smooth, and\r\ncovered with parallel striæ. The sands and gravels rising in small\r\nhillocks near the Cemetery, and slightly covering the clay of the\r\npit, are probably Middle glacial. A boulder clay, formerly exposed\r\nat Icknield Street, Birmingham, while presenting the same physical\r\ncharacteristics as the Wolverhampton clay, differed from it widely in\r\nthe nature of the embedded erratic blocks. Instead of having travelled\r\nfrom the Lake District or Scotland, a large proportion were derived\r\nfrom rocks that occur _in situ_ at the Berwyn and Arenig Hills. The\r\ncondition of the New Red Sandstone ridge, against which this boulder\r\nclay rested, was remarkable. The sandstone rock was broken up, and\r\nlarge fragments of it were lifted out of their position and thrust into\r\nthe middle of the drift.\r\n\r\nThe changes of level which occurred during the glacial epoch are shown\r\nby the deposits at Frankley Hill. In the clays and sands cut through by\r\nthe Halesowen Railway only a few erratics (felsites) were found; but on\r\nthe summit of the section they are abundant and of large size (_e.g._,\r\n4 × 4 × 2ft.) Professor Bonney, who has examined them, feels certain\r\nthey must have come from Wales, having seen nothing like them in the\r\nLake District. Their height is nearly 800ft. above the sea level. Were\r\nthese erratics brought by land ice, the alteration in the physical\r\ngeography of the country must have been enormous to have enabled a\r\nglacier to have moved downwards over this point; were they dropped from\r\nicebergs, the land must have been depressed to the extent of at least\r\n900ft., to form a sea in which the bergs could have floated.\r\n\r\nTurning to the _Middle Glacial Clays, Sands, and Gravels_, these may\r\nbe seen more or less developed in almost every section cut through\r\nundulating ground; and they are occasionally twisted and contorted. In\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood of Birmingham they are not fossiliferous.\r\n\r\nAt Ketley, near Wellington (Shropshire) however, fossiliferous sands\r\nand gravels occur, which I am inclined (provisionally) to assign to\r\nthis period. They rest upon a bed containing erratic blocks of granite,\r\nand other rocks of northern origin; and I collected from them 13\r\nspecies of mollusca. Only one species was peculiarly northern (_astarte\r\nborealis_) but all in the group have an arctic range of habitat. The\r\nelevation of these beds is about 357 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nAt Fox Hall Field, New Lodge, Lilleshall (Shropshire) in a pit worked\r\nfor sand, 463 feet above the sea, Mr. Woodward discovered 21 species\r\nof mollusca, three--viz., _Dentalium abyssorum_, _Natica affinis_, and\r\n_Astarte borealis_--being characteristically arctic and extinct in\r\nBritish waters.\r\n\r\n_The Upper Boulder Clay_ is worked for bricks in many localities.\r\nIt is distinguished from the Lower Boulder Clay, by having erractic\r\nblocks sparsely scattered through it. It is often very compact and\r\ntenacious. No fossils have as yet been found in it; unless indeed a\r\nclay derived from a drain in a street at Wolverhampton, in which I\r\ndetected fragments of _Tellina balthica_, the spine of an _Echinus_,\r\n_Polymorphina lactea_, and _Polystomella crispa_, may be assigned to\r\nthis division of the epoch.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary _dispersion of erratic blocks_ over the surface\r\nof the ground remains to be noticed, and constitutes one of the most\r\nremarkable phenomena in local glacial geology. I distinguish the\r\nboulders resting on the surface of the ground from those embedded in\r\nthe clay beds, although it is of course possible and probable that the\r\nclay has been largely denuded, and the boulders have thus been left\r\nexposed. Many of these erratic blocks may therefore belong to the Lower\r\nBoulder Clay; while others may have fallen from the icebergs which\r\nduring the proved subsidence of the land must have floated over the\r\n“Midland” sea, and have been deposited in the Upper boulder clay, while\r\nit was in process of accumulation.\r\n\r\nHow far the dispersion of erratics over the Midlands may be referred to\r\nthe ice sheet of some geologists, or to the icebergs of the Archipelago\r\nperiod in the history of Great Britain, must, at present, be regarded\r\nas an open question.\r\n\r\nThe Midland erratics have undoubtedly travelled from three distinct\r\nregions, viz., (1) from Wales, (2) the western part of the Lake\r\ndistrict, and (3) Kirkcudbrightshire. Boulders from the more easterly\r\npart of the Lake district, such as the Snap granite boulders, so\r\nabundantly spread over Yorkshire, have not been found in this\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar distribution of the Midland erratics is noteworthy.\r\nCommencing at Bushbury Hill (a little to the north of Wolverhampton,\r\non the table land facing towards the N.W.) the Lake rocks and the\r\nScotch rocks--Criffell granites and Eskdale granites--are largely\r\nintermingled. Journeying westwards, a stream of boulders from Wales\r\ncrosses the northern streams. On and around the Clent Hills (1023 feet)\r\nsouth west of Birmingham, Welsh felsites are the only boulders to be\r\nfound. Birmingham itself being in the rear of the higher part of the\r\ntable land on which it stands, is in a kind of protected district, so\r\nfar as the northern stream of boulders is concerned, and the erratics\r\nin its immediate vicinity are chiefly Welsh felsites; a few fragments\r\nhowever of granite are occasionally found.\r\n\r\nPOST GLACIAL BEDS.--The most complete section of post glacial beds\r\nin this locality was obtained during excavations made at Shustoke,\r\nnear Birmingham; when a bed of black peat, containing the remains of\r\n_Elephas antiquus_, _Cervus elephas_, and _Bos primigenius_, with\r\nhazel nuts and fragments of wood, was discovered 7ft. 6in. beneath the\r\nsurface. The section was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Soil                          1ft.  0in.\r\n  Sandy marl                    1ft.  8in.\r\n  Yellow clay (stiff)           3ft.  8in.\r\n  Blue clay (stiff)             1ft.  2in.\r\n  Black peat                    1ft. 10in.\r\n  “Ballast” gravel and sand     3ft.  0in.\r\n  Sandstone and marl.\r\n\r\nThe fossils found in the peat have been placed in the Geological\r\nMuseum of the Mason College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPETROGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nNotes on the Igneous and Metamorphic Rocks of the Birmingham District.\r\n\r\nBY S. ALLPORT, F.G.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe space available for some account of the crystalline rocks being\r\nstrictly limited, it would be useless to attempt anything more than\r\na brief general description of the most important and interesting\r\nvarieties. Fortunately there is abundance of material, for Birmingham,\r\nas a central point, affords unusual facilities for the study of this\r\nbranch of petrology. Although the rocks here described appear to be\r\nscattered over a rather wide area, it will be found that every locality\r\nmentioned may not only be easily reached from one of the railway\r\nstations, but that a good series of specimens may be collected and the\r\nreturn journey made within the same day.\r\n\r\nTHE MALVERN HILLS.--It was clearly shown by Dr. Holl, in 1865, (Quar.\r\nJour. Geol. Soc., Vol. xxi.) that the central portion or axis of this\r\nchain of hills consists of a great series of true crystalline schists,\r\namong which the prevailing types are hornblendic and micaceous gneiss,\r\nhornblende-schist, mica-schist, and a quartzo-felspathic rock, all of\r\nwhich are more or less distinctly foliated. There is, however, great\r\nvariety in the relative proportions of the constituents; in many\r\nplaces either the hornblende or the mica are nearly, or even quite\r\nabsent; the felspar and quartz then form the mass of the rock. In\r\nthe quarries on the east side of the North Hill, beautiful examples\r\nof hornblende and felspar rock are abundant; they contain more or\r\nless quartz, with a little mica, and occasionally pass by insensible\r\ngradations from a well-marked gneissic structure into a coarsely\r\ncrystalline mass in which foliation is no longer apparent. These\r\nlatter are, however, exceptional cases, and there can, I think, be\r\nno doubt that we have here, in the Midlands, a considerable exposure\r\nof the oldest type of foliated crystalline schists, or as they are\r\nnow frequently called Pre-Cambrian or Archæan rocks. The rocks of the\r\nNorth Hill are probably the oldest; they have been much disturbed, and\r\nare generally the most coarsely crystalline of the series. The more\r\nbasic portions have suffered a considerable amount of alteration; the\r\nsecondary constituents, chlorite and epidote, become abundant, and\r\noccasionally the hornblende has been completely replaced by the latter\r\nmineral; the rock then becomes an epidote schist of a pale-yellowish\r\ncolour. In Swinyards Hill there is a micaceous gneiss with garnets,\r\nand in Raggedstone Hill there are interesting varieties of contorted\r\nmica-schist containing a large proportion of quartz. Dykes of intrusive\r\nrocks occur in nearly all the hills, but become far more numerous\r\ntowards the north; they are very uniform in appearance, and are\r\nprobably altered dolerites or diorites; very few specimens have been\r\nexamined, and they belong to the former group. In the North Hill there\r\nare some masses of true diorite, but their relation to the hornblendic\r\ngneisses with which they are associated has not been clearly\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nMOUNT SORREL GRANITE.--The granite is of two varieties, red and\r\ngrey, the difference being due to the fact, that in the red masses,\r\nthe partially decomposed felspar has been coloured by ferric oxide.\r\nThe rock is a hornblendic granite, the constituents being quartz,\r\nfelspar, biotite, hornblende and titanite, with magnetite and a little\r\napatite. The felspars are orthoclase and plagioclase; the former is\r\nmuch decomposed, while the plagioclase frequently remains clear, and\r\nexhibits well its twin striation. Biotite was originally abundant,\r\nbut is very frequently replaced by a clear green substance, which\r\nis strongly dichroic, the two colours being grass-green, and clear\r\nyellow. The hornblende has been greatly decomposed; clear crystals\r\nare, however, not uncommon, and exhibit the usual optical characters\r\nof the mineral. The products of alteration are chlorite and epidote.\r\nThe titanite appears in reddish-brown grains, but is not very abundant.\r\nIn 1879, the writer discovered the junction of the granite with the\r\nsedimentary rocks, and proved that the former was intrusive (Geol.\r\nMag. dec. ii., Vol. vi., p. 181). The junction occurs in Brazil\r\nWood, where there is a small quarry, in which granite veins may be\r\nseen to penetrate the strata in various directions; a large mass of\r\ngranite is also within a few yards. Some of the phenomena of _contact\r\nmetamorphism_ may here be readily studied, the granite having converted\r\nthe slate into a crystalline micaceous schist, quite similar in\r\ncharacter to those produced under like conditions round the granite in\r\nCornwall and elsewhere. Small garnets occur in the altered slates, and\r\nalso in the granite close to the junction.\r\n\r\nTHE CHARNWOOD SYENITES.--The Syenites and other igneous rocks of\r\nCharnwood, have been described by Messrs. Hill and Bonney (Quar. Jour.\r\nGeol. Soc. Vol. xxxiv., p. 199.) The original constituents are felspar,\r\nhornblende, quartz, apatite, ilmenite, magnetite and titanite. The\r\nfelspar is of two kinds, orthoclase and plagioclase, the former is very\r\nturbid and decomposed, while the plagioclase is clear, and retains its\r\nusual optical characters. The curious intercrystallization of quartz\r\nand felspar, known as _micropegmatite_, is common in the masses of\r\nsyenite near Groby; the best examples, however, have been found by the\r\nwriter in the Markfield rock, where it appears to form a ground-mass in\r\nwhich the larger crystals of orthoclase and plagioclase are enclosed.\r\nA small portion of the hornblende is still characteristic, but the\r\ngreater portion appears in various stages of decomposition; the\r\nalteration products being chlorite and epidote. Titanite is by no means\r\nrare, and occurs in well formed twin crystals.\r\n\r\nDIORITES OF ATHERSTONE AND NUNEATON.--A careful examination of many\r\nspecimens collected by the writer from the various masses marked in\r\nthe map 63 S.W. of the Geological Survey shows clearly that they are\r\ndiorites, the characteristic constituents being hornblende and a\r\ntriclinic felspar; these minerals, together with magnetite and apatite\r\nare invariably present, and in addition, a little orthoclase is seldom\r\nabsent. The best specimen examined is from a quarry near Marston Jabet;\r\nit is a fine-grained rock, similar to a basalt in external appearance,\r\nbut contains numerous crystals of hornblende and plagioclase which\r\nare generally quite unaltered. The clear brown crystals of hornblende\r\nare unusually well developed, and afford excellent opportunities of\r\nexamining their crystallographic and optical characters. There are also\r\npresent many grains of magnetite, and a few needles of apatite. The\r\nonly product of alteration is a little calcite in the spaces between\r\nthe crystals. Other specimens from the same quarry will perhaps give\r\na better idea of the general character of the rocks of the district,\r\nand they possess a special interest, as they afford unusually good\r\nexamples of successive stages of alteration. In one specimen the\r\nconstituents are well preserved, the plagioclase is clear and exhibits\r\nits characteristic twin striation; the hornblende is, for the most\r\npart, unaltered, but is much fissured, and occasionally contains so\r\nmany cavities that the crystals are little more than skeletons. A\r\nground-mass in which the constituents were set has been highly altered,\r\nand now consists of a fine granular substance, partly serpentinous,\r\nwith here and there a little calcite. A second example is quite\r\nsimilar in texture to the last; the felspar, still recognisable as\r\ntriclinic, has been partially converted into a grey turbid substance.\r\nThe hornblende occurs in various stages of alteration; some crystals\r\nare but slightly attacked, while others are to a considerable extent\r\nreplaced by a pale green serpentinous substance. The alteration has\r\nfollowed the cleavage-lines and fractures, while the numerous cavities\r\njust mentioned are also filled by the same substance. In a single slice\r\nthere may be seen almost every degree of change from a slight marginal\r\nerosion to a mere skeleton of the original. Of the latter, however,\r\nsome little is always left; and whether the alteration be little or\r\ngreat, the crystalline forms are perfectly preserved. In a third\r\nspecimen the alteration has proceeded still further, the whole of the\r\nhornblende crystals having been completely converted into pale green\r\npseudomorphs; they were originally large and well developed, and their\r\nforms are still perfectly sharp and distinct. The felspar is here quite\r\nturbid and opaque, and the interstitial ground-mass is represented by\r\ncalcite.\r\n\r\n_Purley Park, near Atherstone._--The rock here contains, in addition to\r\nthe usual brown hornblende, many crystals and grains of clear yellowish\r\naugite, and several pseudomorphs after olivine. The augite crystals\r\nexhibit the usual forms, some being twins. The pseudomorphs after\r\nolivine are quite similar to others observed in certain highly altered\r\ndolerites, they consist of calcite or calcite and viridite; they are\r\nnumerous, and are generally larger than the crystals of augite or\r\nhornblende.\r\n\r\n_Quarry close to Atherstone._--This rock also contains both augite\r\nand hornblende; and lastly, in the railway cutting at Chilvers Coton,\r\nseveral interesting varieties of diorite may be found.\r\n\r\nTHE RHYOLITES OF THE WREKIN NEAR WELLINGTON, SHROPSHIRE.--In the\r\nlarge quarry in Lawrence Hill, at the north end of the Wrekin, and\r\nat Lea Rock on the Shrewsbury Road, are to be found some of the\r\nmost beautiful varieties of ancient volcanic glassy rocks hitherto\r\ndiscovered in Britain. The rocks in their present condition do not\r\nlook like glass, owing to a process of devitrification, which they\r\nhave evidently undergone. There can, however, be no room for doubt\r\nas to their original vitreous condition, for they exhibit, under the\r\nmicroscope, certain peculiar perlitic and spherulitic varieties of\r\nstructure, associated with characteristic forms of microliths, which\r\nare found only in the pitchstone and obsidian varieties of volcanic\r\nglass. In the quarry in Lawrence Hill, thick beds of volcanic ashes and\r\nagglomerates are to be seen dipping towards the north at a high angle,\r\nand an examination of this hill and the Wrekin shows that they both\r\nconsist of a series of stratified ashes alternating with several flows\r\nof rhyolite. One of the ash beds contains numerous spheroidal blocks\r\nof thoroughly characteristic varieties of glassy rocks; they have not\r\nyet been described, but it may here be stated that, in addition to\r\nmany typical varieties of known rhyolites, there are also included\r\namong them some of the rarer glassy kinds described by Zirkel in his\r\nPetrography of the 40th Parallel. Beautiful examples of the spherulitic\r\nand perlitic varieties may be found at Lea Rock, and have been\r\ndescribed by the writer in the Quar. Jour. Geol. Soc. Vol. xxxiii., p.\r\n449. It has been shown by Dr. Callaway, that all these rhyolites are\r\nof Pre-Cambrian age; we have here, therefore, the clearest proof that,\r\nduring very early geological periods volcanic action was of the same\r\nkind, and produced the same results, as in more recent times.\r\n\r\nSOUTH STAFFORDSHIRE.--The igneous rocks of the South Staffordshire\r\ncoalfield belong to the basic series, and are, without exception,\r\ndolerites or basalts, the latter being merely a fine grained variety of\r\nthe former. They have been intruded among the coal measures and shales,\r\nand are frequently found in an excellent state of preservation. The\r\noriginal mineral constituents are crystals, or crystalline grains of\r\ntriclinic felspar, augite, olivine, magnetite, ilmenite, and apatite.\r\nThese minerals are very frequently quite unaltered, with the exception\r\nof the olivine, which is often partly converted into serpentine; this\r\nis the pale green substance seen along the cracks, and around the sides\r\nof the grains; generally, however, the decomposition has been continued\r\nuntil the formation of complete serpentinous pseudomorphs after olivine\r\nhas been the result. The Hailstone Hill, near Rowley Church, is the\r\nbest locality for varieties in texture and composition, as also for\r\ncontemporaneous veins. In the large quarry there is a very coarsely\r\ncrystalline variety containing large flat plates of ilmenite, and here\r\nalso may be found some light-coloured veins in which orthoclase is\r\nthe predominant felspar. The writer has also found in the same quarry\r\nvessicular and amygdaloidal varieties of the rock. It need scarcely be\r\nmentioned that, minute details of structure and composition can only be\r\nstudied in thin slices under the microscope. Rocks of similar character\r\nto the above occur in the following localities:--Pouk Hill, near\r\nWalsall; Titterston Clee Hill (sheet 55, N.W.), Knowl Hill, near Kinlet\r\n(sheet 55, N.E.), and Swinnerton Park, eight miles N.E. of Stafford.\r\nFor fuller descriptions of these rocks, see Allport, Quart. Jour. Geol.\r\nSoc., Vol. xxx., p. 529.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMining Statistics of the South Staffordshire Coalfield.\r\n\r\nBy PROFESSOR W. E. BENTON, A.R.S.M., F.G.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERALS WORKED.--The principal minerals worked within the limits of\r\nthe South Staffordshire Coalfield are coal, ironstone, and fireclay\r\nfrom the Carboniferous formations, and limestone from the underlying\r\nSilurian rocks.\r\n\r\nTHE COAL is bituminous, non-caking, and much of it contains a high\r\npercentage of water and oxygen. Some of the seams produce excellent\r\nhouse-coal, others manufacturing and steam coal.\r\n\r\nTHE IRONSTONE is an argillaceous carbonate of iron, occurring as\r\nnodules in the roofs of the coal seams, or as thin beds within them.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRECLAY, particularly in the neighbourhood of Stourbridge, has a\r\nhigh refractory power.\r\n\r\nQUANTITY OF MINERALS RAISED.--The annual produce of minerals during the\r\nlast twenty years has remained without any considerable alteration. The\r\nGovernment Mineral Statistics for 1885 are not yet published, but in\r\n1884 the quantities of minerals raised in South Staffordshire Coalfield\r\nwere:--Coal, 9,688,047 tons; ironstone, 116,951 tons; fireclay, 205,320\r\ntons; limestone (no statistics given). The respective values of these\r\nminerals at the mines were estimated at:--coal, £2,785,313; ironstone,\r\n£62,974; fireclay, £42,781.\r\n\r\nThe total number of persons employed at the mines during the same\r\nperiod was 23,782.\r\n\r\nDESTINATION OF THE MINERALS.--The greater part of the coal is\r\nconsumed in the district for house purposes, for steam raising, for\r\nthe manufacture of bricks, pottery, glass, salt, &c. The remainder is\r\ncarried out of the coalfield into the south and south-western districts\r\nof England by the London and North Western, Great Western, and Midland\r\nRailway Companies, for house and steam purposes. The gas coals and\r\ncoke used in the Birmingham district are not the product of the South\r\nStaffordshire Coalmeasures, but are brought principally from North\r\nStaffordshire, Derbyshire, and Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the ironstone raised is smelted within the district, in\r\naddition to large quantities of iron ore (hydrated oxide) brought from\r\nthe Northampton and North Staffordshire mines. The manufacture of pig\r\niron has within the last decade decreased to such an extent that less\r\nthan one-third of the existing furnaces of South Staffordshire are at\r\npresent in blast.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of pig produced in the coalfield in 1884, was 356,873\r\ntons; in the reduction of which 810,936 tons of coal (including coal\r\nconverted into coke) were used, or about 45½ cwts. of coal to one ton\r\nof pig iron. The whole of the pig iron is retained in the district. The\r\nfinished iron trade retains its importance, more than one-third of the\r\nexisting puddling furnaces and rolling mills in Great Britain occur\r\nwithin the limits of the South Staffordshire Coalfield.\r\n\r\nThe finished iron is produced from local pig iron, and from pig iron\r\nbrought from Derbyshire, Yorkshire, and North Staffordshire. The\r\nsteel production in South Staffordshire is gradually increasing. The\r\nprocesses adopted are those known as the Bessemer, Gilchrist and open\r\nhearth.\r\n\r\nThe South Staffordshire fireclay is worked principally in the\r\nneighbourhood of Brettle Lane and Stourbridge, and is employed in the\r\nproduction of firebricks, gas retorts, pottery, etc. Much also is\r\nconveyed into other districts in a raw condition for pottery purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Silurian limestone is worked partly in open work in the\r\nneighbourhood of Dudley, and partly by ordinary underground mining\r\noperations at the Wren’s Nest, Sedgley, and at Walsall.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THE MINING OF SOUTH STAFFORDSHIRE.--There\r\nare several noteworthy features in the mining of South Staffordshire.\r\nA stranger is especially impressed with the large number of separate\r\ncollieries in working (about 600) in proportion to the quantity\r\nof mineral raised. This peculiarity is due essentially to the\r\ninsignificant depth at which the minerals occur below the surface\r\n(indeed, at Foxyard, near Tipton, coal has long been quarried in an\r\noutcrop of the 10 yard seam). This “Shallow Mining” has passed its\r\nmeridian. The future mining of the district is forecast by those\r\nremarkable operations on the “red ground,” forming the eastern side\r\nof the coalfield. The most recently opened seam in the red ground is\r\nat Hampstead, three miles north of Birmingham, where coal mining is\r\ncarried on below the Permian and Triassic, at a depth of more than 600\r\nyards.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the mining is the unique South Staffordshire mode of\r\ngetting coal in the ten yard seam, called “Square Work.” This method\r\nhas met with much condemnation from strangers, but after trial of\r\nother methods, it still dominates. A further and most strongly marked\r\npeculiarity of the South Staffordshire area is the tendency of some of\r\nthe Black Country coals to spontaneous ignition. Much coal has thus in\r\ntimes past been sacrificed; but a better acquaintance with the causes\r\nof this phenomenon has led to measures which have reduced and which\r\nmust still further reduce this sacrifice of wealth.\r\n\r\nMINES’ DRAINAGE.--In the Tipton and Old Hill districts many of the\r\ncoal mines are water-logged. In 1873 a Parliamentary Commission however\r\nwas appointed to drain this area, and was empowered to levy rates to\r\ndefray the drainage expenses. The drainage area under the direction\r\nof this Mines’ Drainage Commission is 50 square miles. The principal\r\npumping stations are the Moat, the Stoneheath Station, and the Bradley\r\nStation. The Bradley pumping engines (a quarter of a mile from Moxley\r\non the Great Western Railway) are of the compound type having 52-inch\r\nand 90-inch steam cylinders. These engines, with a 10 feet stroke,\r\nand six strokes per minute, work two 27-inch plunger pumps, and raise\r\nfrom a depth of 126 yards more than 4,000,000 gallons of water per 24\r\nhours. As a result of this gallant effort to recover these water-logged\r\nminerals, the number of pumping stations has been gradually reduced in\r\nthe Tipton district from 77 in 1873 to 10 in 1885, and the quantity\r\nof water from 23,000,000 to 10,000,000 of gallons daily. To meet the\r\ninevitable expenses, a rate of 9d. per statute ton is levied on all\r\ncoals, slack, and ironstone; 3d. per statute ton on all fireclay\r\nand limestone, and 1d. per statute ton for surface drainage on all\r\nminerals, raised in the Tipton district. In the Old Hill district a\r\nmuch lower mines’-drainage rate is collected.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE.\r\n\r\nBOOKS, PAPERS AND MAPS BEARING UPON THE GEOLOGY OF THE BIRMINGHAM\r\nDISTRICT.\r\n\r\n_Fundamental Gneissic and Volcanic Rocks._\r\n\r\nPhillips, Prof., “On the Geology of the Malvern and Abberley Hills.”\r\nMemoirs of the Geological Survey, Vol. ii., 1848.\r\n\r\nHoll, Dr. H.

R. HUGHES, F.L.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is believed that this is the first attempt to give a connected\r\naccount of the Zoology of the neighbourhood of Birmingham, although the\r\nBotany of the District has long attracted diligent and enthusiastic\r\nworkers. The subject, however, has not been neglected, and past and\r\npresent members of the Birmingham Natural History and Microscopical\r\nSociety, and other naturalists, have from time to time made public, in\r\nthe _Midland Naturalist_ and elsewhere, their observations on the more\r\nimportant classes of the animal kingdom. Some of the classes in the\r\nsub-kingdoms, PROTOZOA, CŒLENTERATA, VERMES, and ARTHROPODA (it is to\r\nbe regretted) have been almost entirely neglected.\r\n\r\nThe limited amount of space allotted to Zoology in the present volume\r\nand the limited amount of time at the disposal of the contributors\r\nhave prevented the presentation of complete lists in all the divisions\r\nselected, although the Editor believes that the various papers now\r\nsubmitted furnish--so far as they go--a very fair, if not an exhaustive\r\naccount of our local fauna. It would have been desirable to have\r\ndiscussed, more fully than is done by the various contributors, the\r\nquestion of the Geographical distribution of animals in the district,\r\nbut this question, for the reasons above stated, must be left until\r\nanother occasion. The division of the MICROSCOPIC FAUNA has been made\r\nsomewhat arbitrarily, in order to meet local circumstances. It is hoped\r\nthat at some future time these papers may be extended, and become the\r\nfoundation for a complete record of the Zoology of the district.\r\n\r\nWithout any invidious comparison, the Editor may say that, in the\r\ndomain of local zoology, by far the most systematic study has been\r\nthat devoted during many years by Mr. Thomas Bolton, F.R.M.S., to the\r\nmicroscopic fauna of the neighbourhood. The number of new species which\r\nthis able and industrious naturalist has added to science, probably\r\nequals if not exceeds that of the discoveries recorded in any other\r\npart of England during the time Mr. Bolton has been an observer.\r\nMoreover, his novel and successful method of disseminating these\r\norganisms among microscopists, has contributed largely to scientific\r\nknowledge, not only in England, but on the Continent, and even in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAlthough not coming within the category of the local fauna, very fine\r\ncollections of the classes ECHINODERMATA and CRUSTACEA have been made\r\nby Mr. G. Sherriff Tye, of Richmond Road, Handsworth, who will be happy\r\nto show the same to members of the British Association. His excellent\r\ncollection of MOLLUSCA, many of which are noticed in this volume, will\r\nalso be on view.\r\n\r\nThe Entomological collection made by Mr. W. G. Blatch--the work of a\r\nlifetime--many specimens of which are referred to in this volume, will\r\nsimilarly be on view, on application to Mr. Blatch, at Green Lane,\r\nSmall Heath. It is right to state that this naturalist has added very\r\nmany new species to the fauna of the district. The Coleoptera occurring\r\nin the Midlands will be exhibited by Mr. Blatch in Bingley Hall.\r\n\r\nThe collection of local fishes taken by members of the Birmingham and\r\nMidland Piscatorial Association (established in 1879) of which Mr.\r\nJames Gregory is Honorary Secretary, contains some very handsome and\r\nwell-mounted specimens which may ordinarily be seen in the Society’s\r\nRoom, at the Grand Hotel, on application to Mr. Field, the proprietor.\r\nThe collection for the present forms part of the Exhibition in Bingley\r\nHall. It should be mentioned that this Association has done good work\r\nin stocking the River Trent with about 35,000 Trout fry (_Salmo fario_)\r\nduring the last few years.\r\n\r\nThe Editor offers no apology for mentioning the exceptionally fine\r\nOrnithological collection of Mr. R. W. Chase, President of the\r\nBirmingham Natural History and Microscopical Society. The collection\r\ncomprises, in sequence, the eggs, and the birds in various stages\r\nof growth towards maturity. The specimens are mounted so as to show\r\ninstructively the surroundings of the various birds as seen in their\r\nnatural habitats. Mr. Chase will be happy to show his collection to\r\nmembers of the British Association, on application at his residence,\r\nSouthfield, 7, Edgbaston Road, Edgbaston.\r\n\r\nAlthough Birmingham is nearly the central part of England, and thus\r\nfarthest removed from the sea, it may not be uninteresting to state\r\nthat some attention has been given to Marine Zoology, the Birmingham\r\nNatural History and Microscopical Society having several times made\r\nexcursions to parts of the coast for the purpose of dredging specimens.\r\nThe PENNATULIDA, dredged by the Society, at Oban, in 1881, were\r\ndescribed by Professor A. Milnes Marshall, M.D., D.Sc., F.R.S., and\r\nMr. W. P. Marshall, M.I.C.E., in a Report, with illustrations by the\r\nauthors, published in the “Midland Naturalist” for 1882, which gained\r\nthe Darwin Gold Medal, awarded by the Midland Union of Natural History\r\nSocieties, at the sixth annual meeting, held at Tamworth, in 1883. The\r\nspecimens may be seen in the annexe of the Exhibition, at Bingley Hall.\r\n\r\nThe limit of radius of about twenty miles round Birmingham, including\r\nparts of the counties of Warwick, Worcester, and Stafford, chosen\r\nby the botanists who have contributed to the present work, has been\r\ngenerally accepted by the zoologists except in the division of the\r\nMOLLUSCA, which is mainly confined to a radius of twelve miles, as\r\nfixed by local Conchologists several years ago. Some latitude has\r\nhowever been allowed, to meet exceptional cases, necessitated by the\r\nwider range of animals as compared with that of plants.\r\n\r\nThe thanks of the Editor are due to the various local contributors,\r\nand especially to Mr. E. de Hamel, late President of the Tamworth\r\nNatural History Society, for his kind co-operation in furnishing the\r\nchapter on Mammals and Reptiles. In strict order of classification,\r\nthe division of Reptiles should have followed that of Birds, but\r\nfor convenience in the present arrangement it has not been thought\r\ndesirable to separate this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nMammals and Reptiles.\r\n\r\nBY E. DE HAMEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--MAMMALS.\r\n\r\nThe district around Birmingham is admirably suited for our native\r\nanimals, abounding as it does with fertile and well-watered valleys,\r\nwild moorlands, and extensive woods; on the other hand, its large\r\npopulation renders the prolonged existence of individual and striking\r\nrarities well-nigh impossible.\r\n\r\nThe value of the matter contained in this chapter has been much\r\nenhanced by the personal observations of many of the best Midland\r\nnaturalists.\r\n\r\nCHEIROPTERA.\r\n\r\nAdopting the late Professor Bell’s classification of British\r\nquadrupeds and reptiles, the Bats come first under consideration; and\r\nout of the fourteen species described by him, no fewer than nine are\r\nto be found in this district. The Noctule or Great Bat, _Scotophilus\r\nnoctula_, is the largest of our British species, and is characterised\r\nby its lofty flight. There is a colony of these Bats in the roof of\r\nCliff Hall, near Kingsbury, and another in a hollow of a lime tree in\r\nthe Moat House Avenue, Tamworth. The Hairy-armed Bat, _S. Leisleri_,\r\nwhich has a zig-zag flight, occurs on the Warwickshire Avon. The\r\nCommon Bat, or Flittermouse, _S. pipistrellus_, is often seen flying\r\nnear buildings in broad daylight, and secretes itself in crevices.\r\nThe Reddish-grey Bat, _Vespertilio nattereri_, is found in roofs of\r\nchurches and similar buildings. Daubenton’s Bat, _V. Daubentonii_,\r\nflies close to the surface of water, and has been seen flying both at\r\nmid-day and dusk over the River Anker at Tamworth, and is abundant\r\nat Stratford-on-Avon; it hides in trees and buildings. The Whiskered\r\nBat, _V. mystacinus_, frequents the sheltered side of high hedges, and\r\nsecretes itself in any convenient chink. The Long-eared Bat, _Plecotus\r\nauritus_, possesses ears nearly as long as its head and body combined,\r\nand is generally distributed; it collects in clusters under tiled roofs\r\nand in church towers. The Barbastelle Bat, _Barbastellus Daubentonii_,\r\nis not uncommon in Warwickshire; it flutters lazily round moving\r\nobjects, and hides in crevices. The last local species is the Lesser\r\nHorse-shoe Bat, _Rhinolophus hipposideros_, which is gregarious, and\r\nhaunts roofs of houses; it is easily distinguished by its curious nasal\r\nappendage.\r\n\r\nINSECTIVORA.\r\n\r\nThe Hedgehog, _Erinaceus Europæus_, common everywhere, hibernates in\r\na nest of leaves. The Mole, _Talpa Europæa_; abundant, pied and light\r\ncoloured varieties plentiful. The Common Shrew, _Sorex vulgaris_,\r\noften, found dead on pathways. The Water Shrew, _S. fodiens_, is\r\nmore rare, but has been found near Tamworth, at Great Barr, and in\r\nthe Birmingham Botanical Gardens. The Lesser Shrew, _S. pygmæus_, is\r\nomitted, as it is now generally considered to be but a variety of _S.\r\nfodiens_.\r\n\r\nCARNIVORA.\r\n\r\nThe Badger or Brock, _Meles taxus_, whilst rare, is very equally\r\ndistributed over the district. On April 14th, 1877, one was obtained\r\nin the Foxhole Hill, in Bentley Big wood, near Atherstone; a female\r\nand three young ones were taken alive in the spring of 1884, in a\r\nwood, near Croxall; there are some more badgers in the same wood this\r\nyear, 1886. In March, 1885, a single one was captured at Bentley,\r\nnear Redditch; the keeper at Beaudesert reports that they are still\r\nplentiful on Cannock Chase. The Otter, _Lutra vulgaris_, like the\r\nBadger, though rare, still frequently occurs in the Midlands,\r\nespecially on the rivers Anker, Tame, and Trent, and their tributaries;\r\nas well as the Warwickshire Avon. On the Tame, a few years since, a\r\nfemale Otter and brood of young ones was seen several times swimming\r\nnear an osier bed in the Cliff meadows; another was shot when crossing\r\nthe river at the back of Broad Island, near Tamworth; two young ones\r\nwere killed in a hay field, close by Hopwas Wood; and a large Otter was\r\nfound in a brook at Wigginton, a mile from the river, and destroyed\r\nafter a desperate encounter; still another was seen trotting along the\r\nbanks of the Tame, close by the town of Tamworth; while the largest\r\nOtter known to have been taken in the river Avon was captured on the\r\nfirst of June, 1886, at its junction with the river Arrow; it weighed\r\n28lbs. The Weasel, _Mustela vulgaris_, and the Stoat, _M. erminea_,\r\nare both plentiful. The Polecat or Fitchet, _M. putorius_, is becoming\r\ndecidedly rare, only three having been recorded in the district during\r\nthe last few years; the first of these occurred at Alvecote Wood, the\r\nsecond at Hints, in the neighbourhood of Tamworth, and the third at\r\nMerivale, near Atherstone. The Pine Marten, _Martes abietum_, although\r\nbelieved now to be absolutely extinct in the Midlands, used to be found\r\nin Needwood Forest, and a specimen taken many years ago near Rugeley is\r\nnow in the possession of Mr. R. W. Chase. The Fox, _Vulpes vulgaris_,\r\nbeing strictly preserved, is sufficiently abundant.\r\n\r\nRODENTIA.\r\n\r\nThe Squirrel, _Sciurus vulgaris_, is thinly distributed, and may\r\noccasionally be seen in most of the large woods, as for instance, those\r\nin Sutton, Hagley, and Arbury Parks, where the dreys are built on the\r\nforked branches of the trees. The Dormouse, _Myoxus avellanarius_,\r\nis also rare, but is occasionally met with by hedgers, when dressing\r\nfences. As it is semi-gregarious, when one is found more may be\r\nexpected. The nest is built of grass, compact, globular, about five\r\ninches in diameter, with the entrance near the base. A nest was taken\r\nat Cofton Reservoir, near Barnt Green, in April, 1885. The Harvest\r\nMouse, _Mus minutus_, is the smallest of our quadrupeds, building a\r\nsmall round and firm nest among the ears of corn, or stems of reeds. It\r\nis generally distributed, and has been taken near Stratford-on-Avon,\r\nMerivale and Atherstone. The long-tailed Field Mouse, _M. sylvaticus_,\r\nis plentiful, and often turned up by the spade or plough. The Common\r\nMouse, _M. musculus_, abundant in buildings. The Black Rat, _M.\r\nrattus_, although rare, is still to be found in small colonies,\r\ngenerally in the cellars of large towns, where it is comparatively\r\nsecure from the attacks of its greatest enemy and destroyer, the Brown\r\nRat. A single recent example has been taken within the last six months\r\nat New Parks, near Leicester, and is now in the possession of Mr. F.\r\nT. Mott. The rarity of the occurrence justifies this record, although\r\nthe locality is outside the radius agreed upon. The Brown Rat, _M.\r\ndecumanus_ is abundant in both buildings and hedgerows. The Water Vole,\r\n_Arvicola amphibius_, better known as the Water Rat, is common on all\r\nthe streams of the Midlands. The common Field-Vole, _A. agrestis_, is\r\nplentiful in the meadows, where their nests are frequently exposed by\r\nthe mowers. The Red Field or Bank-Vole, _A. glareolus_, is much more\r\nrare and distinguished from the last species, by its rich chestnut fur;\r\nseveral of these were taken at Belvoir Castle, in July, 1885. The Hare,\r\n_Lepus timidus_, and the Rabbit, _L. cuniculus_, have been greatly\r\nreduced in numbers since the passing of the Hares and Rabbits Bill in\r\n1881.\r\n\r\nRUMINANTIA.\r\n\r\nThe Red Deer, _Cervus elaphus_, as recently as 1800, roamed wild over\r\nCannock Chase and Needwood Forest, but is now confined to the areas of\r\nthe large parks, such as Gopsall and Beaudesert. The Fallow Deer, _C.\r\ndama_, formerly existed in thousands on Cannock Chase, and is now the\r\nchief ornament of the parks. The Roe Deer, _Capreolus caprea_, was also\r\ncommon, but has become extinct. The Wild Cattle, _Bos taurus_, under\r\nthe fostering care of the Lords Ferrars, at Chartley, near Stafford,\r\nstill constitute the greatest curiosity among the Midland mammals.\r\nGarner, in his history of Staffordshire, relates that these animals at\r\none time roamed free over Needwood Forest, and how, in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, William de Ferrariis enclosed a thousand acres of high-lying\r\nmoorland, the turf of which is in the same condition now as then, and\r\nwithin this enclosure the animals are maintained in their pristine\r\npurity. At the present time this herd consists of about thirty head,\r\ncomprising three bulls, the oldest aged nine years, a magnificent\r\nbeast, with deep chest, black muzzle and ears, black-tipped,\r\nwide-spreading horns, and forefeet also flecked with black, the\r\nprevailing colour being a rich creamy white. So sensitive are these\r\ncattle, as the result of their high breeding, that calves unduly\r\nhandled are forsaken by their mothers; and older beasts, if subjected\r\nto forcible restraint, will often, as the keeper put it to the writer,\r\n“just wag their tails and die.” When the calves are with them the cows\r\nare dangerous to approach.\r\n\r\nPACHYDERMATA.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the local mammals, the celebrated red breed of Tamworth\r\nPigs, _Sus scrofa_, deserves mention as one of the best, most useful,\r\nand healthy of the many well-known kinds; but there is no reason to\r\nsuppose that it, any more than the others, can claim descent from the\r\nreputed Wild Pigs of Needwood.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--REPTILES.\r\n\r\nSAURIA.\r\n\r\nThe Sand Lizard, _Lacerta agilis_, occurs in Leicestershire and\r\nWorcestershire, and is to be met with on Cannock Chase and similar\r\nlocalities. The Viviparous Lizard, _Zootoca vivipara_, is found in\r\nSutton Park, is smaller and more active than the Sand Lizard, and\r\ndiffers from that species inasmuch as the young are born alive.\r\n\r\nSAUROPHIDIA.\r\n\r\nThe Blindworm, _Anguis fragilis_, is not infrequent, specimens have\r\nbeen obtained at Sutton Park, Merivale, Baddesley Ensor, Beaudesert,\r\nthe Forest of Wyre and Habberley Valley, near Kidderminster.\r\n\r\nOPHIDIA.\r\n\r\nThe Ringed Snake, _Natrix torquata_, is seldom seen in the\r\nneighbourhood of Tamworth--although on one occasion the occupants of a\r\nboat on the river Anker saw one of these snakes glide down the bank and\r\nswim towards them--it is common in Merivale Park, occasionally found in\r\nSutton Park, and near Dudley. The Viper or Adder, _Pelias berus_, our\r\nonly poisonous reptile, is locally common, but generally rare; a large\r\nnumber were killed in Sutton Park during the summer of 1884; it is\r\nplentiful on Chartley Moss, Cannock Chase, and in the Forest of Wyre.\r\nThe Viper is shorter and thicker than the Common Snake, and easily\r\ndistinguished by the V shaped marking on the head.\r\n\r\nANOURA.\r\n\r\nThe Common Frog, _Rana temporaria_, is very abundant, and may be\r\nseen in hundreds in the ditches during March. The Common Toad, _Bufo\r\nvulgaris_, is also generally distributed.\r\n\r\nURODELA.\r\n\r\nThe Common Warty-Newt, _Triton cristatus_, may be found in ponds\r\nthroughout the district. The Smooth-Newt, _Lissotriton punctatus_, is a\r\nhabitant of every clear horsepond, where it can be seen either basking\r\non the bottom, or rising to the surface for air; this species often\r\nleaves the water, and hides under stones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nBirds.\r\n\r\nBY R. W. CHASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe district surrounding Birmingham does not present any striking\r\nor special feature to the ornithologist; but owing to its varied\r\ncharacter, comprising as it does hill and dale, with considerable\r\nstretches of moorland and a plentiful supply of water, in rivers,\r\nreservoirs and pools, it forms haunts particularly attractive to birds.\r\n\r\nThe number of local species recorded is large, consisting of about\r\nsixty residents, forty-two migrants, and eighty occasional and rare\r\nvisitors; making a total of one hundred and eighty-two species.\r\n\r\nThe large number of marine or littoral species occurring so far inland\r\nis an interesting fact to be noted, and from the records of such\r\nspecies as the Curlew Sandpiper, Turnstone, Ring Dotterel, Common and\r\nArctic Terns, much valuable information might be brought to bear upon\r\nsome of the knotty problems of migration. It is principally during\r\nautumn that such species are noticed, and invariably the examples\r\nobtained are immature, or birds of the year.\r\n\r\nThe classification and synonymy used in this brief summary is in\r\naccordance with the fourth edition of “Yarrell’s British Birds.”\r\n\r\nACCIPITRES.\r\n\r\nFALCONIDÆ.--Golden Eagle, _Aquila chrysaetus_, has occurred at\r\nNeedwood.

Dunlin, _Tringa alpina_, very\r\nrare; has occurred at Small Heath. Curlew Sandpiper, _T. subarquata_,\r\nrare; a small flock seen in the neighbourhood of Barnt Green in\r\nSeptember, 1885. Ruff, _Machetes pugnax_, very rare; once occurred at\r\nSutton Coldfield. Bartram’s Sandpiper, _Bartramia longicauda_, once\r\nnear Warwick, on October 31st, 1851 (Zool. pp. 3,330, 3,388, 4,254).\r\nCommon Sandpiper, _Totanus hypoleucus_, summer visitor; it is probable\r\nthis species breeds in the district. Wood Sandpiper, _T. glareola_,\r\nvery rare, once occurred at the Sewage Farm. Green Sandpiper, _T.\r\nochropus_, has occurred at Packington, near Tamworth. Redshank, _T.\r\ncalidris_, rare; has occurred at the Sewage Farms; also at Sutton\r\nColdfield and near Tamworth. Greenshank, _T. canescens_, occasional\r\nvisitor in autumn; has occurred at Castle Bromwich. Curlew, _Numenius\r\narquata_, rare; has occurred at Great Barr and Polesworth.\r\n\r\nGAVIÆ.\r\n\r\nLARIDÆ.--Black Tern, _Hydrochelidon nigra_, often occurs in spring\r\nand autumn. Sandwich Tern, _Sterna cantiaca_, occasional visitor; more\r\nfrequently observed towards autumn. Common Tern, _Sterna fluviatilis_,\r\noften observed during spring and autumn migration; chiefly birds of\r\nthe year during the latter period. Arctic Tern, _S. macrura_, the\r\nsame remarks apply to this species as to _S. fluviatilis_. Sabine’s\r\nGull, _Xema sabinii_, once occurred near Coleshill, in October, 1883.\r\nBlack-headed Gull, _Larus ridibundus_, not rare; frequently met with\r\nduring spring on some of the large reservoirs. Lesser Black-backed\r\nGull, _Larus fuscus_, rare; has been shot at Bromsgrove and Handsworth.\r\nGreat Black-backed Gull, _L. marinus_, once occurred at Shustoke,\r\nSeptember 20th, 1874. Large Gulls are often observed passing over,\r\nwhich probably belong to this species. Common Gull, _L. canus_, rare,\r\nhas been shot near Alcester. Kittiwake Gull, _Rissa tridactyla_, rare;\r\noccasionally seen during winter. Pomatorhine Skua, _Stercorarius\r\npomatorhinus_, very rare; considering the unusual number of Skuas\r\nthat appeared during the autumn of 1879, it is rather surprising that\r\nmore examples were not noticed in this district, very few being shot.\r\nBuffon’s Skua, _S. parasiticus_; an immature bird was shot on Lichfield\r\nRacecourse in October 1874.\r\n\r\nTUBINARES.\r\n\r\nPROCELLARIIDÆ.--Manx Shearwater, _Puffinus anglorum_; an immature bird\r\nwas picked up exhausted in the Chandos road in this town, September\r\n5th, 1880. Forked-tailed Petrel, _Cymochorea leucorrhoa_, very rare.\r\nOne picked up September 4th, 1883, dead in a yard, in Guildford\r\nstreet in this town, and subsequently recorded in the local papers as\r\n_Procellaria pelagica_. Stormy Petrel, _P. pelagica_, has occurred too\r\nmany times to particularize each instance.\r\n\r\nPYGOPODES.\r\n\r\nALCIDÆ.--Little Auk, _Mergulus alle_, very rare; several instances\r\nare on record of its occurrence in the district, one was obtained in\r\nNovember, 1863. Puffin, _Fratercula arctica_; one picked up in Broad\r\nstreet in this town, in an exhausted condition, 1884.\r\n\r\nCOLYMBIDÆ.--Great Northern Diver, _Colymbus glacialis_, very rare; one\r\nwas obtained at Tipton, January 8th, 1877.\r\n\r\nPODICIPEDIDÆ.--Great crested Grebe, _Podiceps cristatus_, generally\r\ndistributed throughout the district, and far from rare; breeds\r\nregularly at Sutton Coldfield, Little Aston, and Barnt Green.\r\nSclavonian Grebe, _P. auritus_; one shot at Sutton Coldfield, in\r\nDecember, 1868. Little Grebe, _P. fluviatilis_, not rare; breeds\r\nsparingly in suitable localities; small flocks or families are often\r\nobserved during the autumn and winter, especially on the river Tame.\r\n\r\nSTEGANOPODES.\r\n\r\nPELECANIDÆ.--Common Cormorant, _Phalacrocorax carbo_, a rare occasional\r\nvisitor. Shag, _P. graculus_, very rare; has occurred twice in the\r\nneighbourhood of King’s Norton, also near Tamworth. The Gannet, _Sula\r\nbassana_, one taken exhausted in a field of potatoes near Tamworth.\r\n\r\nHERODIONES.\r\n\r\nARDEIDÆ.--Common Heron, _Ardea cinerea_, generally to be met with.\r\nThere are several Heronries in the county of Warwick. Little Egret,\r\n_Ardea garzetta_, said to have been obtained at Sutton Coldfield,\r\nmany years ago. Night heron, _Nycticorax griseus_, one obtained\r\nnear Alcester. Common Bittern, _Botaurus stellaris_, more rare than\r\nformerly; a great many examples have been obtained from time to time,\r\nespecially in the neighbourhood of Sutton Coldfield.\r\n\r\nODONTOGLOSSÆ.\r\n\r\nPHŒNICOPTERIDÆ.--Flamingo, _Phœnicopterus roseus_; one stated to have\r\nbeen shot in the neighbourhood of Wolverhampton, but probably an\r\nescaped bird.\r\n\r\nANSERES.\r\n\r\nANATIDÆ.--Brent Goose, _Bernicla brenta_, scarce; two shot at King’s\r\nNorton, October 24th, 1882, during stormy weather; has also been\r\nobtained near Tamworth. Flocks of geese are often observed passing\r\noverhead, but of course it is impossible to determine to what species\r\nthey belong. Canada Goose, _B. canadensis_, has been shot several times\r\nin the district, whether escaped specimens or not, it is difficult to\r\nsay, as this species is often kept in a semi-wild state. Mute Swan,\r\n_Cygnus olor_, is to be found upon many large pools and ornamental\r\nwaters; breeds here plentifully. Polish Swan, _C. immutabilis_, once\r\noccurred at Earlswood reservoir. Ruddy Sheld-Duck, _Tadorna casarca_,\r\nhas been shot at Nechells, also at Yardley Wood; probably escaped\r\nbirds. Common Sheld-Duck, _T. cornuta_, rare visitor. A magnificent\r\nmale was shot at Hawkesbury, near Coventry, in 1881. Mallard, _Anas\r\nboscas_, plentiful on some pools; breeds throughout the district.\r\nGadwall, _A. strepera_, very rare; one shot near Lichfield in December,\r\n1873. Shoveller, _Spatula clypeata_, formerly bred in Staffordshire,\r\nbut very scarce of late years; one shot at Sutton Coldfield, in 1867.\r\nTeal, _Querquedula crecca_, sparingly met with, a few pairs breed in\r\nthe district; the nest has several times been taken in Sutton Park.\r\nWidgeon, _Mareca penelope_, winter visitor; often seen in large\r\nflocks upon the reservoirs and pools during severe weather. Scaup,\r\n_Fuligula marila_, has occurred once at Wichnor near Tamworth. Pochard,\r\n_F. ferina_, rare; has been shot near Tamworth. Tufted Duck, _F.\r\ncristata_, very rare; a male was shot in Aston Park many years ago,\r\nby a gamekeeper of James Watt, Esq. Golden Eye, _Clangula glaucion_,\r\none shot near Tamworth. Goosander, _Mergus merganser_, an accidental\r\nvisitor in winter; specimens obtained are generally either immature\r\nbirds or females. Red-breasted Merganser, _M. serrator_, very scarce;\r\nonly young birds have been obtained. Smew, _M. albellus_, very rare.\r\nA female was shot on the canal at Selly Oak, about fifteen years ago.\r\nAnother example of this species was obtained at Elford, near Tamworth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFishes and Mollusca.\r\n\r\nBY G. SHERRIFF TYE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--FISHES.\r\n\r\nThe waters within easy reach of Birmingham afford to those interested\r\nin the Natural History of Fishes excellent opportunities for study, and\r\nare much resorted to by anglers. To those who do not incline to the\r\nstudy of fish or fishing, it will probably be a matter of surprise to\r\nknow the abundance and excellence of the individuals, and the variety\r\nof species occurring within an hour’s walk of the centre of our town.\r\nOf the river Tame, a well-known angler states: “In my opinion this is\r\na remarkable little river; in three and a half miles it contains in\r\nabundance at least ten species of fish, viz., trout, pike, chub, tench,\r\nperch, roach, rudd, dace, gudgeon, minnow, all of which, except the\r\npike, attain to a size equal to any in rivers or pools within a hundred\r\nmiles of Birmingham.” Large fish are not so common now as formerly, but\r\nprobably this river will recover, and attain its wonted excellence,\r\nwhen the “Black Country” sewerage works are completed.\r\n\r\nThe river Cole is a fine trout stream. The river Blythe, Coleshill,\r\nis an excellent stream, especially for eels. The river Trent with\r\nits tributaries, the Anker, Tame, and Mease, is celebrated for many\r\nspecies of fish, and is a great resort of anglers. Earlswood and the\r\nCorporation reservoirs, the pools at Sutton Coldfield, Great Barr Park,\r\nKing’s Norton, Barnt Green, and many others are all well stocked with\r\nfish, and will render fine examples to all who seek them.\r\n\r\nThe writer’s thanks are cordially rendered to members of the\r\nBirmingham Piscatorial Association and to other gentlemen for valuable\r\ninformation, kindly given, respecting the localities and habitats of\r\nFishes. The weights of the largest specimens recorded, have all been\r\nverified by the anglers who have taken them.\r\n\r\nThe classification adopted in this paper is that of “Yarrell’s British\r\nFishes,” second edition, 1841.\r\n\r\nThe number of local species recorded is thirty-three.\r\n\r\nACANTHOPTERYGII.\r\n\r\nPerch, _Perca fluviatilis_, accommodates itself to either river or\r\npool, the former producing the cleanest and handsomest fish. It has\r\nbeen taken of fine size, 4½ lbs., Rotton Park Reservoir; 3½ lbs.,\r\nTardebigg; 3 lbs., Rotton Park Reservoir; 2 lbs. to 3 lbs. from Old\r\nSoho Pool, now the site of a Railway Wharf.\r\n\r\nRuffe, _Acerina vulgaris_, not uncommon, river Trent, Alrewas. The\r\nwriter has taken a number from a pool near Wednesbury.\r\n\r\nMiller’s Thumb, _Cottus gobio_, is to be met with in most of our little\r\nrivulets, lurking under stones.\r\n\r\nThe Rough-tailed three-spined Stickleback, _Gasterosteus trachurus_;\r\nubiquitous. The males in the breeding season are resplendent in\r\nscarlet and green, and fight for supremacy. It is remarkable with\r\nwhat ease individuals accommodate themselves to sea water. The\r\nSmooth-tailed Stickleback, _G. leiurus_; the Short-spined Stickleback,\r\n_G. brachycentus_; the Four-spined Stickleback, _G. spinulosus_ and\r\nthe Ten-spined Stickleback, _G. pungitius_; although not so common as\r\n_G. trachurus_, are all found in ditches communicating with the river\r\nAnker, at Tamworth.\r\n\r\nABDOMINAL MALACOPTERYGII.\r\n\r\nCarp, _Cyprinus carpio_. The writer has had one of large size from\r\nPlants Brook Reservoir, 7½ lbs., and has seen a larger one in the pool.\r\nThe largest recorded was from Sandwell Pool, 12 lbs.\r\n\r\nCrucian Carp, _C. carassius_, is not uncommon; the writer has seen\r\nnumbers of them taken from small cattle pits on a farm in Warwickshire.\r\nIt is a pretty and hardy species in an aquarium.\r\n\r\nGold Carp, _C. auratus_, the well known “gold-fish,” used to breed in a\r\npool at West Bromwich, into which warm water from an engine flowed, but\r\nit is not found there now.\r\n\r\nBarbel, _Barbus vulgaris_, is found in abundance in the River Trent,\r\nbut in general size not to be compared with those taken in the Thames.\r\nRiver Trent, 7½ lbs. and 8 lbs.\r\n\r\nGudgeon, _Gobio fluviatilis_, in streams fairly common, also in canals,\r\nbut rare in pools. Earlswood Reservoir.\r\n\r\nTench, _Tinca vulgaris_, not uncommon; of large size at Handsworth,\r\nSutton Coldfield, and near Barnt Green, in pools; plentiful at the\r\nlatter place, rivers Tame, Anker, &c.; 3 lbs. Edgbaston Pool. It is one\r\nof the easiest fishes to keep in confinement. A golden variety of this\r\nspecies is bred in the private pools of gentlemen in this country, it\r\nis said to have been introduced from Germany. Fine specimens were to be\r\nseen at the recent Fisheries Exhibition in London.\r\n\r\nBream, _Abramis brama_, in the larger rivers. When this species\r\nassembles, after an overnight’s baiting, it may often be taken in great\r\nnumbers. 5 lbs. River Trent. The writer has known a few hours’ fishing\r\nin a Warwickshire stream to yield sufficient fine fishes of this\r\nspecies to fill a hamper as much as a couple of men could carry.\r\n\r\nRoach, _Leuciscus rutilus_, occurs very commonly and of large size; old\r\nSoho Pool, 3 lbs. weight, a truly noble fish; Sharpley Reservoir, 2 lbs.\r\n\r\nDace, _Leuciscus vulgaris_, River Trent, 14 ozs.\r\n\r\nChub, _Leuciscus cephalus_, River Tame, 5½ lbs. 5 lbs. and many\r\napproaching that weight.\r\n\r\nRudd or Red-eye, _Leuciscus erythropthalmus_. In the River Tame.\r\n\r\nBleak, _Leuciscus alburnus_. In streams and in Earlswood Reservoir. A\r\nfriend remarks, “I have taken this species in Earlswood Reservoir, and\r\nGudgeon also, the only instance I have met with where these two river\r\nfish have occurred in a pool.” They were probably bred from escaped\r\nbait.\r\n\r\nMinnow, _Leuciscus phoxinus_, common in many streams.\r\n\r\nLoach, _Cobitis barbatula_, is found in streamlets in many places. The\r\nwriter has taken it at Handsworth. It is said to be delicate food.\r\n\r\nThe Spined-Loach, _Botia tænia_, is rarer than the preceding. It has\r\nbeen taken in the Rivers Anker and Tame at Tamworth.\r\n\r\nPike, _Esox lucius_, is found in large pools and rivers. 26 lbs.; 25\r\nlbs. 6 oz., Earlswood Reservoir; 23 lbs., Middleton Pool; 22 lbs. 6\r\noz., Pebble Mill Pool; 12 and 13 lbs., Sutton Park. The writer could\r\nrelate many instances of the voracity of the Pike, and incidents of\r\nsport,--one must suffice. A Pike was hooked near some floodgates in the\r\nTame, and on taking out the hook he found that it had gone through a\r\nWater-Shrew, which the fish had just taken, and still held in its mouth.\r\n\r\nSalmon, the king of British fishes, _Salmo salar_, comes legitimately\r\nwithin our radius of twenty miles. It has been taken from the Eel traps\r\nin the River Tame at Tamworth; in the River Trent at Yoxall; and in\r\nthe River Severn at Bewdley. At the last mentioned place a specimen\r\nweighing 40 lbs. has been captured.\r\n\r\nCommon Trout, _S. fario_, Bourne Brook, Fazeley, 7 lbs.; River Tame, 5½\r\nlbs., 4 lbs. several, and many below that weight; River Trent, 4 lbs. 2\r\nozs.; River Cole, Packington.\r\n\r\nLochleven Trout, _S. Levenensis_. In April, 1884, the Water Department\r\nof the Corporation of Birmingham stocked their new reservoir (90 acres)\r\nat Shustoke with 3,000 of this fish. The reservoir at Witton was\r\nstocked with 2,000 fish at the same time. They were yearlings, about\r\n3 inches long, and are now (August, 1886) from 2 lbs. to 3¼ lbs. in\r\nweight. These reservoirs will therefore in a few years be good places\r\nfor this species of Trout.\r\n\r\nGrayling, _Thymallus vulgaris_, River Trent, Shenstone, 2 lbs.;\r\nAlrewas, 17 ozs.; Bourne Brook, Fazeley.\r\n\r\nSUBBRACHIAL MALACOPTERYGII.\r\n\r\nThe Burbot, _Lota vulgaris_, the only British species of the family of\r\nthe Gadidæ that lives permanently in fresh water, is found in the River\r\nAnker at Tamworth, the largest fish recorded being 5 lbs.; 3 lbs. 2 ozs.\r\n\r\nAPODAL MALACOPTERYGII.\r\n\r\nThe Sharp-nosed Eel, _Anguilla acutirostris_, and the Broad-nosed Eel,\r\n_Anguilla latirostris_. In rivers and pools generally. Fine specimens\r\nof _A. acutirostris_ are taken in the River Blythe, some weighing 4\r\nlbs. each. The third species of Eel mentioned by Yarrell, the Snig,\r\n_A. mediorostris_, occurs with the two others in the Worcestershire\r\nAvon, and doubtless finds its way into the Arrow and other tributary\r\nstreams. It differs from the two preceding species, being much smaller,\r\nindividuals rarely exceeding half a pound each; and in its habit of\r\nroving and feeding by day. It is of superior flavour to its congeners.\r\nThe Snig may easily be distinguished by the first five cervical\r\nvertebræ, which are smooth and free from spinous processes, always\r\npresent in the sharp-nosed and broad-nosed Eels.\r\n\r\nCHONDROPTERYGII.\r\n\r\nLampern or river Lamprey, _Petromyzon fluviatilis_. In the River Trent,\r\nand also the Tame and in streamlets, Sutton Park, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--MOLLUSCA.\r\n\r\nThe district around Birmingham is an excellent field for terrestrial\r\nand fluviatile Mollusca. Within a circle of twelve miles radius, which\r\nincludes a portion of the Counties of Warwick, Stafford, and Worcester,\r\ncan be found fifty per cent. of the species and varieties enumerated\r\nin Dr. J. Gwyn Jeffreys’ “British Conchology.” No special quality of\r\nsoil or geological condition is required for the existence of Molluscs;\r\nwhatever the nature of the ground may be, some species or other will\r\nreward the searcher. The number of terrestrial species is usually\r\nthe greatest where limestone is present; indeed some species do not\r\nseem able to maintain their existence away from it, _e.g._, _Helix\r\nericetorum_, _H. virgata_, _H. arbustorum_, and _Cyclostoma elegans_.\r\nThe still beautiful grounds of Dudley Castle were once “happy hunting\r\ngrounds” for the collectors of Mollusca, but the smoke of a thousand\r\nfires has cast a baleful influence over the locality. The dead shells\r\nof species, once abundant, are conclusive evidence that the Molluscan\r\nfauna do not now enjoy a congenial atmosphere in that neighbourhood.\r\n_Helix arbustorum_, may, notwithstanding, still be found there, its\r\nnearest proximity to Birmingham.\r\n\r\nAmong the noticeable species of the district may be mentioned\r\n_Testacella Haliotidea_, found in the garden of a florist at Redditch;\r\n_Succinea virescens_, (Morelet) = _S. putris_ var. _vitrea_ (Jeffreys),\r\nwhich the writer has taken near Plants Brook Reservoir; _Zonites\r\nglaber_, found near Solihull; _Helix Cantiana_,[62] Henley-in-Arden;\r\n_H. virgata_, Grafton, near Alcester; _Balia perversa_, Fenny Compton,\r\nNorthamptonshire. The three last named species are outside the twelve\r\nmiles radius.\r\n\r\nCONCHIFERA.\r\n\r\nThe Midlands are rich in fluviatile forms, nearly all the known British\r\nspecies occur. Those worth noting among the Sphæriidæ are--_Sphærium\r\ncorneum_, var. _Scaldiana_, Acock’s Green; _S. corneum_, var.\r\n_flavescens_, Plants Brook; _S. rivicola_ and _S. ovale_, Acock’s\r\nGreen and Rushall Canal. _S. lacustre_ is not uncommon, and is found\r\nabundantly in a pond at Handsworth.\r\n\r\nThe Pisidia are well represented, four out of our five species\r\noccurring. It is curious that the large form _Pisidium amnicum_ has not\r\nhitherto been taken in the district. The writer took _P. roseum_[63]\r\nfrom several ponds at Meriden in 1885-6.\r\n\r\nThe Unionidæ are extremely plentiful, and the two species _Unio\r\ntumidus_ and _U. pictorum_ attain to an immense size. In the\r\nwriter’s cabinet are examples of _U. pictorum_ of the following\r\ndimensions--2¹⁄₁₆ in. × 5¹⁄₁₆, 2¹⁄₁₆ in. × 5¼, 2³⁄₁₆ in. × 5¼, some of\r\nthem weighing nearly 4 ounces avoirdupois; and of _U. tumidus_, 2⁵⁄₁₆\r\nin. × 4¾, 2⅜ in. × 4⅞, 2¾ in. × 5, the weight of some examples reaching\r\nnearly 6 ounces avoirdupois. These are probably the finest shells of\r\ntheir kind ever taken anywhere. _Anodonta cygnea_ is common, and its\r\nvarieties _incrassata_, _Zellensis_, _pallida_, and _rostrata_ occur.\r\n_A. anatina_, and the varieties _radiata_ and _ventricosa_ are found;\r\nhandsome shells of the latter occur at Barr Park and in the river\r\nBlythe at Coleshill. _Dreissena polymorpha_ is commonly distributed.\r\n\r\nGASTEROPODA.\r\n\r\nIn the order Pectinibranchiata, _Neritina fluviatilis_, the only\r\nrepresentative in England of a genus of world-wide distribution, has\r\noccurred in the river Tame at Aston, but the writer believes is not\r\nnow to be found there. One of our two species of Paludinidæ, _Paludina\r\nvivipara_,[64] _Bythinia tentaculata_, _B. Leachii_, and _Valvata\r\npiscinalis_ make up the list of operculate water snails.\r\n\r\nAmong the Limnæidæ examples of the following genera occur. In the\r\ngenus Planorbis we find all the species except _Planorbis lineatus_,\r\nexcluding of course _P. dilatatus_ (Gould), which only occurs at\r\nManchester, having been introduced on cotton from America. The\r\nepiphragm formed by _P. spirorbis_, in summer, when the solar heat has\r\ndried up its habitat, is a singular item of its economy. It is supposed\r\nthat this habit enabled _P. dilatatus_ to reach our shores. _Physa\r\nhypnorum_ and _P. fontinalis_ are both represented; they are charming\r\ninhabitants of an aquarium, their habit of thread spinning,[65]\r\nespecially in the young state, makes them lively creatures; the lobed\r\nmantle of _P. fontinalis_, nearly enclosing the shell, gives a peculiar\r\ncharacter to the animal.\r\n\r\nOf the six species of Limnæa[66] which occur, it will not be needful\r\nto mention more than one, which is the rarest with us, viz.: _Limnæa\r\nglabra_. Both species of Ancylus are moderately common.\r\n\r\nOf terrestrial Mollusca we enumerate the following Limacidæ--_Arion\r\nater_, _A. hortensis_, _Limax marginatus_, _L. flavus_, _L. agrestis_,\r\n_L. arborum_, _L. maximus_, and as before said one of the Testacellidæ\r\nviz., _T. Haliotidea_. Among the Helicidæ of course the common kinds\r\nare all present. Of the genus Zonites we have the following species:\r\n_Zonites cellarius_, _Z. glaber_, _Z. alliarius_, and its var.\r\n_viridula_, _Z. nitidulus_, _Z. purus_, and its var. _margaritacea_,\r\n_Z. radiatulus_, _Z. nitidus_, _Z. excavatus_ (one only, at Knowle),\r\n_Z. crystallinus_. Among the smaller species of Helix, attention may\r\nbe called to the following: _H. aculeata_, a minute spiny coronet; _H.\r\npygmæa_, the smallest of known Helices; _Helix fusca_, taken in two\r\nlocalities only, at Knowle and Selly Oak. Of the four species of Pupa\r\nfound in Britain, two only occur, _Pupa umbilicata_ and _P. marginata_.\r\nOf the latter species a colony of the white variety has been found\r\ninhabiting a wall at Cleeve Prior, Worcestershire. Only two out of our\r\neleven species of Vertigo have occurred, viz.: _Vertigo edentula_ and\r\nits variety _columella_, and _V. pygmæa_. Two Clausiliæ are found,\r\n_Clausilia laminata_ and _C. rugosa_. It is somewhat singular that of\r\nthe four species inhabiting this country the last named is ubiquitous,\r\nwhile _C. Rolphii_ and _C. biplicata_ are local. The writer has taken\r\nthe rare albino form of _C. rugosa_, at Selly Oak. That exquisite\r\nshell, _Cochlicopa tridens_, var. _crystallina_, has been taken in\r\nthree places; the type is largely distributed in our neighbourhood,\r\nwhereas in others it is rare, while _C. lubrica_ is widespread\r\nin England. _Achatina acicula_, dead shells only, Dudley Castle.\r\n_Carychium minimum_ is commonly distributed.\r\n\r\nIn giving this outline of the Molluscan Fauna of our neighbourhood,\r\nthe writer has called attention to the valuable papers on Embryology by\r\nProfessor E. Ray Lankester, as shedding great light on the affinities\r\nof the Mollusca with other groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nInsects.\r\n\r\nBY W. G. BLATCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Birmingham, and in fact the Midland district\r\ngenerally, has never been considered particularly rich in either the\r\nnumber or variety of its insect productions, and it is a fact that\r\na collection of Midland species, of whatever order, shows very wide\r\ngaps, both in genera and species, when compared with one formed in the\r\neast or south of England. Nevertheless, the Midland Counties are not\r\nentirely barren in this respect, and a catalogue of the insects known\r\nto occur within a radius of twenty miles of Birmingham would be a very\r\nrespectable one. During the last few years a large number of very\r\ninteresting species have been discovered, and there can be no doubt\r\nthat with more workers and greater enthusiasm considerable additions\r\nwould continue to be made. By extending the radius somewhat our list\r\nwould embrace a good array of species which seem to be peculiar to the\r\nMidlands, such as _Bembidium adustum_, _Eutheia clavata_, _Euplectus\r\nnubigena_, _Teredus nitidus_, _Macronychus quadrituberculatus_,\r\n_Hylecœtus dermestoides_, _Tropideres sepicola_, _Bagöus diglyptus_,\r\n_Notodonta bicolor_, &c., &c. At any rate these insects have not\r\nhitherto been detected in any other British localities. It is much to\r\nbe regretted that local entomology suffers greatly from two untoward\r\ncircumstances, viz., the lack of students and the want of a carefully\r\ncompiled list of species of the several orders. The publication of a\r\ncatalogue of local insects as far as our present knowledge extends,\r\nwould undoubtedly tend to stimulate the intelligent pursuit of this\r\nstudy, and it seems surprising that such an important work has not long\r\nago been undertaken by the Natural History Societies of the district.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the limited space allowed for this paper its object\r\nwill, perhaps, best be secured by giving as full a list as possible,\r\nof the rarer and more interesting species belonging to the two most\r\npopular orders, viz., the Coleoptera and the Lepidoptera, together with\r\nsome of the localities in which they occur. With few exceptions the\r\nreferences will be to insects which inhabit the twenty miles radius, a\r\nwider range being taken only in specially interesting cases, but even\r\nthen it will be impossible to give anything like an adequate idea of\r\nthe beetles, butterflies, and moths of the district.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the possibility of error it should be stated that the\r\nnomenclature adopted is (for the beetles) that of the “Catalogue\r\nof British Coleoptera, by Matthews and Fowler, 1883,” and (for the\r\nbutterflies and moths) “Synonymic List of British Lepidoptera, by\r\nRichard South, 1884.”\r\n\r\nCOLEOPTERA.\r\n\r\nThis order is well represented; certain localities in the district are\r\nfavourable to their existence and economy, and many rarities occur.\r\nOnly one Cicindela (_Cicindela campestris_) inhabits our district\r\nand that is generally distributed and plentiful, especially in sandy\r\nplaces. The curious and elegant _Cychrus rostratus_ is often found\r\nunder stones and loose bark at Dudley and Bewdley, and the handsome\r\n_Carabus nitens_ and its congener _C. arvensis_, may be taken on\r\nCannock Chase, both species being now very scarce. _Elaphrus riparius_\r\nand _E. cupreus_ occur not uncommonly in wet and boggy places.\r\n_Notiophilus substriatus_ (generally a sea-side species) may be found\r\noccasionally on Cannock Chase, and so also may the curious _Nebria\r\nlivida_. This latter beetle was first discovered on the Chase by Mr.\r\nJ. T. Harris, and the writer has verified its occurrence there many\r\ntimes. It is a remarkable fact that this is the only known instance of\r\nthis species inhabiting an inland locality--its head quarters being\r\nat Bridlington Quay and two or three other parts of the north-east\r\ncoast--it lives in the argillaceous cliffs, and on Cannock Chase it is\r\nmet with in a similar formation.\r\n\r\nOf the curious genus Dyschirius two species only appear to have\r\nsettled in our neighbourhood, viz., _D. æneus_ and _D. globosus_, both\r\noccur at Bewdley and on Cannock Chase--the latter also at Coleshill and\r\nSutton Park.\r\n\r\nThe genus Bembidium is well represented, 33 of the 50 British\r\nspecies and varieties being taken in the Birmingham district. A few\r\nmay be named: _B. rufescens_, under bark and in damp places; _B.\r\nquinquestriatum_, on walls at Smallheath and Olton; _B. Mannerheimii_,\r\nKnowle, Bewdley, Cannock Chase; _B. articulatum_, Knowle, Bewdley; _B.\r\nnigricorne_, Cannock Chase; _B. monticola_, Bewdley; _B. Stephensi_,\r\nSutton Park; _B. prasinum_, Bewdley. In this connection the writer may\r\nperhaps be allowed to refer to the finding by himself of _B. adustum_\r\nin large numbers at Tewkesbury. This species was previously represented\r\nonly by a very few old specimens, and had not been found for more than\r\n40 years, until he had the pleasure of re-establishing it.\r\n\r\n_Patrobus assimilis_ is found sparingly on Cannock Chase; _Trechus\r\ndiscus_, _T. micros_ and _T. secalis_, are plentiful in the river banks\r\nat Bewdley; _T. micros_ occasionally turns up at Smallheath amongst\r\nbones placed in the garden as a trap for Homalotæ; _T. obtusus_ has\r\noccurred at Bewdley and Cannock Chase, and in the latter locality the\r\nwriter once found a few examples of the rare _T. rubens_.\r\n\r\nThe important genus Pterostichus has many representatives: _P.\r\nversicolor_, at Solihull, Sutton Park, and Cannock Chase; _P. lepidus_,\r\nCannock Chase; _P. picimanus_ and _P. anthracinus_, Bewdley; _P.\r\nminor_, Coleshill and Cannock Chase; _Platyderus ruficollis_ seems to\r\nbe generally distributed, but scarce. _Amara fulva_ may frequently be\r\ntaken under stones in sandy places at Sutton Park, Cannock Chase, and\r\nBewdley; _A. consularis_ at Sutton Park and Hopwas Wood; _A. spinipes_,\r\nat Dudley and Bewdley; _A. patricia_, Cannock Chase; _A. acuminata_,\r\nSutton Park; _A. lunicollis_, Small Heath, Sutton, Cannock Chase, and\r\nBewdley; _A. continua_, _A. communis_, and _A. ovata_, at Knowle,\r\nColeshill, and Bewdley.\r\n\r\n_Badister sodalis_ is to be had at Dudley and Bewdley. All the species\r\nof Calathus occur, and _Taphria nivalis_, a closely allied beetle,\r\nturns up now and again, singly, at Small Heath, Knowle, Bewdley, and\r\nTrench Woods. The Anchomeni are fairly well represented, and it seems\r\nvery likely that additional species may yet be added to our local list.\r\nThe following may be selected as most worthy of notice: _Anchomenus\r\noblongus_, Bewdley; _A. atratus_, Coleshill, Cannock Chase, and\r\nBewdley. A single _Lebia chlorocephala_ was captured in hedge rubbish\r\nnear Acock’s Green. _Dromius quadrisignatus_ is a Sutton Park species,\r\nbeing found rarely under bark of Oak trees. _Blechrus maurus_, which\r\nseems decidedly out of its reckoning in a Midland locality, has been\r\ntaken at Bewdley and Leamington. All the species of Metabletus occur,\r\nand are pretty generally distributed. _Cymindis vaporariorum_ inhabits\r\nCannock Chase, where it may be found lurking under the heather and\r\nloose stones, but is not abundant. In the same locality the curious\r\n_Miscodera arctica_ may, in some seasons, be met with in plenty. Two\r\nspecies of Chlænius occur, viz.: _C. vestitus_ at Bewdley, and _C.\r\nnigricornis_ at Cannock Chase. Of the extensive genus Harpalus, the\r\nfollowing species may be cited, it being understood that several of the\r\ncommoner forms exist here in great abundance. _H. puncticollis_, Dudley\r\nand Bewdley; _H. griseus_, Cannock Chase; _H. tardus_, Sutton Park and\r\nBewdley. The pretty little _Acupalpus exiguus_ and v. _luridus_ may be\r\nobtained by searching the Sphagnum on the margin of Coleshill Pool. All\r\nthe Bradycelli, except _B. placidus_ and _B. collaris_, are plentiful\r\nin the district, and in certain spots, such as Cannock Chase, they are\r\nextremely abundant. _Anisodactylus binotatus_ occurs on Cannock Chase,\r\nbut is not often to be found.\r\n\r\nThe water beetles are pretty numerously represented in the district\r\ngenerally, the best localities for them being Coleshill, Sutton\r\nPark, Cannock Chase, and Bewdley. It must suffice to mention a few\r\nof the rarer or more striking kinds, _e.g._, _Brychius elevatus_,\r\nat Yardley and Knowle; _Haliplus cinereus_, at Knowle; _Hydroporus\r\nseptentrionalis_, Bewdley; _H. marginatus_, Knowle; _H. picipes_,\r\nCannock Chase; _H. lepidus_, Knowle, Bewdley, Cannock Chase; _H.\r\nduodecimpustulatus_, Bewdley; _H. assimilis_, Sutton Park, Knowle,\r\nCannock Chase; _H. dorsalis_, Yardley, Knowle; _H. marginatus_,\r\nKnowle; _H. nigrita_, Knowle, Bewdley; _H. monticola_, Cannock\r\nChase; _H. neglectus_, Cannock Chase; _H. umbrosus_, Knowle; _H.\r\naugustatus_, Knowle; _Ilybius ater_, Knowle, Cannock Chase; _I.\r\nguttiger_, Coleshill; _Agabus Solieri_, Knowle; _A. affinis_, Sutton\r\nPark; _Gyrinus caspius_, Hopwas; _Hydrobius picicrus_, Knowle;\r\n_Laccobius sinuatus_, Knowle; _L. alutaceus_, Knowle; _L. minutus_,\r\nCannock Chase; _L. bipunctatus_, Cannock Chase; _Limnebius nitidus_,\r\nKnowle, Bewdley; _L. picinus_, Knowle; _Chætarthria seminulum_,\r\nCannock Chase; _Helophorus æqualis_, Bewdley; _H. Mulsanti_, Bewdley;\r\n_Hydrochus augustatus_, Knowle; _Hydræna palustris_, Bewdley; _H.\r\nnigrita_, Knowle, Bewdley; _H. atricapilla_, Knowle; the rare\r\n_Leptinus testaceus_ has been taken at Needwood in the nests of\r\nwild bees. _Agathidium nigripenne_ Sutton Park; _A. lævigatum_,\r\nKnowle, Dudley; _A. atrum_, Yardley, Sutton Park, Cannock Chase; _A.\r\nseminulum_, Coleshill, Knowle, Cannock Chase; _A. varians_, Knowle; _A.\r\nrotundatum_, Cannock Chase; _A. convexum_, Hopwas Wood; _Amphicyllis\r\nglobus_, Bewdley; _Leoides orbicularis_, Cannock Chase; _Anisotoma\r\npicea_, Cannock Chase; _A. litura_, Knowle.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Burying Beetles--Necrophorus and Silpha--occur\r\ngenerally in the district, as also do many of the Cholevæ. Colons\r\nare conspicuous by their absence--only two species having put in an\r\nappearance, viz: _Colon dentipes_, Knowle; and _C. brunneum_, Knowle.\r\nThe interesting groups of Scydmænidæ and Pselaphidæ are remarkably well\r\nrepresented, but room can be found for only a few of the rarer species:\r\n_e.g._, _Scydmænus exilis_, Sutton Park, Hopwas Wood, Cannock Chase,\r\nBewdley; _S. angulatus_, Cannock Chase; _S. hirticollis_, Sutton Park;\r\n_Eutheia plicata_, Budden Wood, _E. Schaumii_, Smallheath, Knowle;\r\n_E. Scydmænoides_, Knowle (abundantly); _E. clavata_, new to Britain,\r\ndiscovered by the writer in Sherwood Forest; _Bryaxis impressa_,\r\nColeshill; _Euplectus punctatus_, Knowle, Bewdley, Cannock Chase; _E.\r\nnigricans_, throughout the district; _E. nanus_, Edgbaston, Bewdley,\r\nCannock Chase; _E. bicolor_, Sutton Park, Hopwas Wood, Cannock Chase,\r\nBewdley; _E. nubigena_, a very distinct species, new to Britain,\r\ndiscovered by the writer in Sherwood Forest in 1885.\r\n\r\nThe Brachelytra have not had much attention paid to them in the\r\nMidlands, the group being a very large one, and the species mostly\r\ndifficult to determine. These insects are plentiful in the district\r\nand many rare forms occur. A few only, comparatively, can be here\r\nspecified:--_Ischnoglossa corticina_, Olton, Sutton Park, Old Hill;\r\n_Thiasophila angulata_, Hopwas Wood, Bewdley (Ants’ Nests); _Dinarda\r\nMarkelii_, Bewdley (in Ants’ Nests); _Atemeles emarginatus_, Bewdley\r\n(in Ants’ Nests); _Ilyobates nigricollis_, _Callicerus obscurus_, _C.\r\nrigidicornis_, Knowle; _Tachyusa scitula_, Bewdley; _Ocyusa maura_,\r\nColeshill; _O. picina_, Sutton Park, Bewdley; _Oxypoda exoleta_,\r\nSmallheath, _O. recondita_, Budden Wood (Ants’ Nests, _Formica rufa_);\r\n_O. sericea_, new to Britain, Smallheath, Edgbaston, Knowle.\r\n\r\nIn the genus Homalota there are 160 British species, of which the\r\nwriter has, up to the present, found 93 in the Birmingham district.\r\nThe following may be noted: _H. currax_ and _H. insecta_, Bewdley;\r\n_H. pavens_, Smallheath; _H. eximia_, Bewdley (previously only found\r\non banks of Scotch rivers); _H. luteipes_, Bewdley; _H. sylvicola_,\r\nColeshill, Cannock Chase, Bewdley; _H. monticola_, Smallheath; _H.\r\ncurtipennis_, Sutton Park; _H. autumnalis_, Knowle, Old Hill, Bewdley,\r\nMiddleton, near Tamworth; _Gymnusa brevicollis_ and _G. variegata_\r\noccur on Cannock Chase, the latter also at Sutton Park; _Megacronus\r\ninclinans_ may be found at Bewdley, and _M. cingulatus_ at Sutton\r\nPark and Cannock Chase; _Staphylinus latebricola_ (in Ants’ Nests),\r\nat Sutton Park and Bewdley; _Philonthus fulvipes_, Sutton Park;\r\n_Ancyrophorus homalinus_, Bewdley; _Trogophlœus halophilus_, Hopwas\r\nWood(!); _Deleaster dichrous_ and var. _adustus_, Bewdley; _Geodromicus\r\nnigrita_, Bewdley; _Deliphrum tectum_, Knowle; _Acidota crenata_,\r\nColeshill; _A. cruentata_, Sutton Park; _Coryphium augusticolle_,\r\nSutton Park, Knowle, Hopwas; _Homalium Allardi_, Smallheath; _H.\r\npunctipenne_, Edgbaston, Sutton Park, Knowle, Bewdley; _H. deplanatum_,\r\nKnowle, Cannock Chase; _H. brevicorne_, Knowle; _H. gracilicorne_,\r\nSutton Park, Hopwas Wood; _H. salicis_, Sherwood Forest; _Phlœocharis\r\nsubtilissima_ and _Prognatha quadricornis_, Sutton Park, Needwood.\r\n\r\nMany of the Trichopterygidæ are found in profusion, including a good\r\nnumber of rare species. _Ptinella testacea_, _P. denticollis_, _P.\r\naptera_, and _P. angustula_, are all plentiful in various parts of\r\nthe district, from Smallheath and Knowle to Cannock Chase and Bewdley\r\nForest. _Pteryx suturalis_ is also generally distributed and fairly\r\nabundant. Several good species of Trichopteryx occur in hot-beds\r\nat Knowle and Edgbaston, and also on the river banks at Bewdley.\r\n_Millidium trisulcatum_ sometimes swarms in one spot at Knowle.\r\n_Ptenidium Gressneri_, a new British species, may be mentioned as\r\nhaving been captured in 1885 at Sherwood Forest. _Triplax russica_\r\nabounds on Cannock Chase, and _T. ænea_ may be taken sparingly at\r\nNeedwood. The very rare _Teredus nitidus_, after being lost sight of\r\nfor nearly 50 years, was again found in Sherwood Forest by the writer\r\nin 1884 and 1885. _Myrmetes piceus_, Hopwas Wood, Bewdley; _Gnathoncus\r\nrotundatus_, Cannock Chase; var. _punctulatus_, Knowle; _Abræus\r\ngranulum_, Salford Priors; _Plegaderus dissectus_, Cannock Chase,\r\nSalford Priors; _Epuræa augustula_, Sutton Park; _Cryptarcha strigata_\r\nand _C. imperialis_, Knowle; Rhizophagus: nine of the species occur in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Birmingham, and the tenth, _R. cœruleipennis_ has\r\nbeen taken at Matlock; _Thymalus limbatus_, Cannock Chase; _Psammæchus\r\nbipunctatus_, Coleshill, Sutton Park; _Antherophagus nigricornis_,\r\nBewdley; _A. silaceus_, Marston Green, Bewdley; _A. pallens_, Solihull,\r\nBewdley; _Myrmecoxenus, vaporariorum_, Edgbaston, Knowle; _Scaphidium\r\nquadrimaculatum_ may be taken at Cannock Chase and Bewdley; _Diphyllus\r\nlunatus_, in the same localities and also near Knowle; _Byrrhus\r\nfasciatus_ and _B. dorsalis_, at Cannock Chase; _Georyssus pygmæus_,\r\nBewdley. The remarkable beetle, _Macronychus quadrituberculatus_,\r\nshould be included in this list, its only British habitat being the\r\nriver Dove, near Burton-on-Trent.\r\n\r\nComing now to the Lamellicornia, the following species may be noted:\r\n_Lucanus cervus_, Bewdley; _Dorcus parallelopipedus_, Bewdley, Cannock\r\nChase, Salford Priors; _Aphodius tesselatus_ and _A. porcus_, Sutton\r\nPark; _Ammœcius brevis_, Bewdley (banks of Severn); _Trox sabulosus_\r\nand _T. scaber_, Bewdley and Cannock Chase; _Hoplia philanthus_,\r\nBewdley, Knowle, &c. Of the Serricornia, a few examples may be given:\r\n_e.g._, _Agrilus augustatus_ and _A. laticornis_, Bewdley; the\r\nbrilliant _Trachys troglodytes_, quite a Southern species, which the\r\nwriter has on several occasions captured in an old pasture at Knowle;\r\n_Elater coccinatus_, Sherwood; _E. pomorum_, Cannock Chase; _E.\r\nbalteatus_, Coleshill, Sutton Park, Bewdley, Cannock Chase; _Athöus\r\nrhombeus_, Sherwood; _Corymbites pectinicornis_, _C. cupreus_, and var.\r\n_æruginosus_, _C. æneus_, Knowle, Bewdley, Cannock Chase; _Sericosomus\r\nbrunneus_ and v. _fugax_, Cannock Chase; _Hydrocyphon deflexicollis_,\r\nBewdley; _Scirtes hemisphæricus_, Cannock Chase; _Lampyris noctiluca_\r\nis spread over the whole district, but is most abundant in Bewdley\r\nForest; _Malachius æneus_ is found at Knowle, and _Haplocnemus\r\nimpressus_ at Sutton Park; _Clerus formicarius_ occurs at Salford\r\nPriors; _Hylecœtus dermestoides_ and _Sphindus dubius_ at Cannock Chase\r\nand Sherwood Forest; _Niptus crenatus_ and _Hedobia imperialis_ occur\r\nat Knowle.\r\n\r\nOf the Longicornia, it must suffice to mention the following:--_Prionus\r\ncoriarius_, Aston and Cannock Chase; _Callidium alni_, Knowle; _Clytus\r\nmysticus_, Bewdley; _Pachyta collaris_ and _P. octomaculata_, Bewdley;\r\n_Strangalia quadrifasciata_, Bewdley and Cannock Chase; _S. nigra_,\r\nBewdley.\r\n\r\nMany of the Donaciæ are plentiful, perhaps the most interesting local\r\nspecies being _D. affinis_, which is found at Knowle.\r\n\r\n_Clythra tridentata_ and _C. quadripunctata_ inhabit Bewdley Forest,\r\nbut _C. tridentata_ is very rarely met with. _Cryptocephalus coryli_,\r\n_C. punctiger_, and _C. fulcratus_ may be beaten out of birches on\r\nCannock Chase, and at Chartley the Scotch species, _C. decempunctatus_,\r\nhas been taken.\r\n\r\n_Salpingus ater_ is at Knowle, and _S. castaneus_ at Coleshill\r\nand Cannock Chase. The curious _Notoxus monoceros_ is abundant at\r\nKidderminster and Bewdley.\r\n\r\nAmong the Rhynchophora the following may be noted: _Platyrhinus\r\nlatirostris_ and _Anthribus albinus_, Salford Priors; _Tropideres\r\nsepicola_, Budden Wood (unique); _Choragus Sheppardi_, Salford\r\nPriors; _Apion Hookeri_, Knowle and Trench Woods; _A. filirostre_,\r\nTrench Woods; _Cænopsis fissirostris_ and _C. Waltoni_, Cannock\r\nChase, also on Hartlebury Common; _Cleonus sulcirostris_, Erdington;\r\n_Cœliodes geranii_ and _C. exiguus_, Bewdley; _Amalus scortillum_,\r\nBewdley, Salford Priors; _Magdalinus barbicornis_, Bewdley;\r\n_Rhyncolus gracilis_, Sherwood Forest is noteworthy; _Phiœophthorus\r\nrhododactylus_, Bewdley; _Scolytus destructor_, Yardley; _S.\r\nintricatus_ and _S. rugulosus_, Bewdley; _Xylocleptes bispinus_, Sutton\r\nPark and Malvern.\r\n\r\nLEPIDOPTERA.\r\n\r\nThis order has received the lion’s share of attention from local\r\ncollectors, with the result that a very fair proportion of the\r\nBritish Micro-Lepidoptera has been discovered in the district.\r\nThe Micro-Lepidoptera have, however, not been looked up with any\r\nenthusiasm, and consequently our knowledge of the extent to which these\r\ninteresting little moths occur about us is extremely limited.\r\n\r\nThe Rhopalocera include all the common species, and also a few which\r\nare always considered desirable by every collector. At Bewdley,\r\n_Aporia cratægi_ used to be found, and doubtless could yet be obtained\r\nif carefully sought for. _Leucophasia sinapis_ flies more or less\r\nabundantly at Bewdley Forest and Trench Woods; it has also been\r\noccasionally taken in woods near Knowle. _Colias edusa_ always an\r\nerratic species, sometimes visits the Midlands, and has been captured\r\nat Yardley, Coleshill, Knowle, and other places. _C. hyale_ also turned\r\nup once or twice in the district. _Gonopteryx rhamni_ is generally\r\ndistributed and plentiful. _Argynnis selene_, _A. euphrosyne_, _A.\r\naglaia_, _A. adippe_, and _A. paphia_ occur near Knowle, and at\r\nBewdley they are all found in great abundance; the variety _valesina_\r\nhas likewise been captured in the Forest. _Melitæa aurinia_ is not\r\nrare in certain spots near Knowle and Bewdley. _Vanessa C. album_ may\r\noccasionally be seen flying in the streets of Birmingham, especially in\r\nthe region of Sparkbrook and Moseley. _V. polychloros_ flies at Knowle.\r\n_V. antiopa_ has several times been captured at Bewdley; and _V. io_,\r\n_V. atalanta_, and _V. cardui_ are met with throughout the district.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of _Limenitis sibylla_ has not been heard of nearer\r\nthan Church Stretton, but _Apatura iris_ has been taken in woods not\r\nfar from Coventry and Leamington. _Melanargia galatea_ is a common\r\nbutterfly at Salford Priors and Trench Woods. _Epinephele hyperanthes_\r\nis abundant at Bewdley. The southern limit of _Cænonympha typhon_\r\nappears to be Chartley Moss, where the butterfly (both light and\r\ndark forms) is anything but rare. _Thecla betulæ_, _T. W. album_,\r\n_T. pruni_, and _T. quercus_ fly at Trench Woods; _T. quercus_ also\r\nnear Knowle, at Bewdley, &c.; and _T. rubi_ is extremely plentiful at\r\nSutton Park and Cannock Chase. _Lycæna argiolus_ is found in several\r\nlocalities near Birmingham, but abounds in the Holly Woods at Sutton\r\nPark. _L. semiargus_ used to be taken many years since, close to\r\nBirmingham, but seems to have become quite extinct.\r\n\r\nIn the division Heterocera the following list of selected\r\nspecies with localities must suffice to represent the moths of\r\nthe district:--_Acherontia atropos_, Knowle, Dudley, Bewdley;\r\n_Sphinx convolvuli_, Birmingham (frequent);

The organisms included in this division\r\nare abundant all round Birmingham; in the canals, reservoirs, and\r\nrivers, in the swags and catchpits, amongst the spoil heaps of the\r\n“Black Country,” and in the numerous clay-pits on the farm lands.\r\n\r\nINSECTA.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to call attention to the identification of the larvæ\r\nof the Trichopterous insects _Agraylea multipunctata_ and _Oxyethira\r\ncostalis_, by Messrs. Kenneth J. Morton and Robert McLachlan. The\r\nperfect insects were bred from larvæ collected in this district, as\r\nreferred to in the “Entomologists’ Monthly Magazine,” May and June,\r\n1886. So many problems in the life history of insects, having aquatic\r\nlarvæ, remain unsolved, that it is desirable that microscopists should\r\npay more attention to this subject.\r\n\r\nARACHNIDA.\r\n\r\nThe curious Diving-bell Spider, _Argyroneta aquatica_, is found in the\r\npools at Sutton Park; and a great variety of species of the Water-Mites\r\nis generally distributed. Mr W. Saville Kent reports that several\r\nspecimens received from this district are new to science.\r\n\r\nTardigrada, viz., _Macrobiotus Hufelandii_, and other species, may be\r\nfound almost everywhere, if carefully looked for amongst damp moss and\r\ndecaying algæ.\r\n\r\nCRUSTACEA.\r\n\r\nIn this class should be mentioned the freshwater Crayfish, _Astacus\r\nfluviatilis_, not of course a microscopic organism; but if it were\r\nomitted here it would not appear in any of the other reports. This\r\nspecies is fairly distributed in most of the smaller brooks, in the\r\ncanals, and larger reservoirs, but is not so abundant or so large as\r\nit is on the lime formations round Oxford. Two other large microscopic\r\nspecies of this class, the freshwater Shrimp, _Gammarus pulex_, and the\r\nwater Wood-louse, _Asellus vulgaris_, are always present, the former\r\nbusy in its office of scavenger in the sandy bottoms of the brooks and\r\nditches, and the latter climbing about, like a monkey, amongst the\r\nwater weeds, investigating the mass of living and decaying organisms\r\nwith which the weeds are clothed.\r\n\r\nENTOMOSTRACA.\r\n\r\nThe members of this sub-class are also to be found everywhere,\r\nbut it is desirable to call special attention to the discovery for\r\nthe first time in Great Britain of the wonderfully transparent\r\n_Leptodora hyalina_, at a visit of the Birmingham Natural History and\r\nMicroscopical Society in 1879, to the Olton Reservoir, near Solihull.\r\nIt has since been found in many localities, and is very abundant in\r\nthe summer and autumn in the Warwick Canal and several reservoirs.\r\n_Hyalodaphnia Kahlbergensis_ is very generally found with it. _Argulus\r\ncoregoni_ is found in the Birmingham and Warwick Canal. It had only\r\nbeen discovered in Great Britain previously in the tanks of the Royal\r\nAquarium at Westminster, which, of course, are not used for British\r\nfish exclusively. The Fairy-shrimp, _Chirocephalus diaphanus_, is found\r\nin only one locality in the district, near Knowle. A few specimens\r\nof the very rare _Lynceus acanthocercoides_ were found near Bewdley,\r\nand amongst other local finds may be mentioned _Moina rectirostris_,\r\n_Macrothrix roseus_, and _Ilyocryptus sordidus_.\r\n\r\nPOLYZOA.\r\n\r\nThese are generally distributed; _Alcyonella fungosa_, _Plumatella\r\nrepens_, _Fredericella sultana_, and _Paludicella Ehrenbergii_ cover\r\nthe root-fibres under the banks of the River Avon, at Evesham.\r\n_Lophopus crystallinus_ is occasionally found in the brooks to the\r\nsouth west of Birmingham. _Cristatella mucedo_ is often very abundant\r\nin the larger reservoirs at Sutton Park, Barnt Green, Olton, &c.\r\nFredericella and Paludicella, have several times been seen in the town\r\nwater supplied by the Corporation.\r\n\r\nROTIFERA.\r\n\r\nThe district appears to be very rich in these organisms, and a\r\ngood number of new species from this locality are enumerated in the\r\nadmirable Monograph on this family now being published by Dr. C.\r\nT. Hudson and Mr. P. H. Gosse. In the five parts already published\r\n(July 12th, 1886), they record one hundred and ninety-two species,\r\nof which ninety-eight have been found in this district, twenty-two\r\nbeing new species. Of the fifteen Flosculariæ eight species have been\r\nfound here, viz., _Flosculariæ regalis_ (new), _F. coronetta_, _F.\r\nornata_, _F. cornuta_, _F. campanulata_, _F. ambigua_, _F. calva_,\r\nand _F. mutabilis_ (new). _Stephanoceros Eichhornii_ may sometimes\r\nbe seen quite clothing the water weeds in the canals and pools. The\r\nalways attractive building Wheel-animalcule, _Melicerta ringens_, is\r\noccasionally present in abundance in the canals, rivers, and pools all\r\nover the district. The writer has taken _Melicerta conifera_ several\r\ntimes. _Melicerta tubicolaria_ was found by Dr. Hudson in Sutton\r\nPark, and has since been found in other localities in this district.\r\n_Limnias ceratophylli_ is very generally abundant. _Limnias annulatus_\r\nhas been found in two places. _Œcistes cystallinus_ is common, and\r\n_Œ. intermedius_ not uncommon. Although beyond the radius, it may\r\nbe interesting to note that _Melicerta Janus_, new to England, was\r\ntaken in one of the Shropshire meres, by the writer on the 23rd of\r\nJune, 1886. It had only been found in Scotland before, by Mr. Hood,\r\nin 1880. The new rotifer, _Œcistes umbella_, was found by Mr. A. W.\r\nWills, together with the rare _Œ. pilula_ in a pool at Sutton Park.\r\nThe charming clustered rotifer, _Lacinularia socialis_, only appears\r\nin the hot summer months, but was surprisingly abundant last year in\r\nthe River Avon at Warwick, literally clothing the weeds with life.\r\nThis rotifer was in fair abundance a few years back in the Barnt Green\r\nReservoir, and last year in the neighbouring canal. The still more\r\ncharming free-swimming clustered rotifer, _Conochilus volvox_, is more\r\ngenerally present, but is not always easy to detect, on account of its\r\ntransparency and continuous quick movements. The writer has taken this\r\nrotifer in the pools at Sutton Park with a muslin net in such abundance\r\nas to form quite a jelly at the bottom of the net. He also found a\r\nnew species, _Conochilus dossuarius_, in 1884. Of the Philodinidæ,\r\nthe following have been found--_Philodina roseola_, _P. citrina_, _P.\r\nmegalotrocha_, _P. aculeata_; _Rotifer vulgaris_, _R. tardus_, _R.\r\nmacroceros_, _R. macrurus_; _Actinurus Neptunius_, _Callidina elegans_,\r\nand _Adineta vaga_. The rare and pretty little _Microdon clavus_ may\r\nbe found swimming about in Coleshill pool. Asplanchna, Synchæta,\r\nPolyarthra, and Triarthra, may be netted in enormous numbers in the\r\nsummer months, especially in all the canals and larger pools, and they\r\noccasionally abound in the smaller pools and even in ditches, together\r\nwith a great variety of the creeping ones, such as Philodina, Rotifer,\r\nNotommata, Brachionus, Anuræa, &c. The wonderful variety of these\r\nliving together in a small ditch in Sutton Park is reported upon in a\r\nshort paper read by the writer before the Birmingham Natural History\r\nand Microscopical Society in February last, and published in the\r\n“Midland Naturalist,” July, 1886. _Hydatina senta_ and _Rhinops vitrea_\r\nmay be looked for amongst the _Euglena viridis_ often seen luxuriating\r\nin farm yard drainage. The abnormal species, _Pedalion mira_, was found\r\nat Knowle in 1884, in fair abundance. The spiny _Anuræa longispina_ was\r\nfound at Olton Reservoir very soon after it was first discovered in\r\nAmerica, and it soon afterwards abounded in the town water, and may be\r\nfound in most large reservoirs.\r\n\r\nANNELIDA, ETC.\r\n\r\nSome interesting examples of the Oligochæta have been found in\r\nthis locality, most of which have been identified by Professor E.\r\nRay Lankester or Mr. E. C. Bousfield, and of these the following\r\nare noteworthy--_Chætogaster limnæi_, and _C. diaphanus_, _Nais\r\nhamata_, _N. lurida_, _N. appendiculata_, and _N. barbata_; _Stylaria\r\nparasitica_, _Dero digitata_, _D. obtusa_, _D. Perrieri_, _D. limosa_,\r\nand _D. crassa_; _Salvina serpentina_, and _Ælosoma quaternarium_. The\r\nCercaria (the larva of a fluke) which infests the common Water Snail,\r\n_Limnæa stagnatis_, is occasionally found; also _Mesostomum rostratum_,\r\n_Derostomum vorax_, _Planaria lactea_, and _Piscicola geometrica_.\r\n\r\nHYDROZOA.\r\n\r\nBoth _Hydra vulgaris_ and _H. viridis_ are of course found everywhere.\r\n_Cordylophora lacustris_, which is usually more abundant in brackish\r\nwater, was found last year in the canal at Hamstead, near Handsworth.\r\nThe writer has found it in the Stourbridge canal, and in the River\r\nStour. Some years back the writer heard of a canal boat being docked at\r\nDudley Port which was found to be clothed with this Hydrozoon as with\r\nvelvet.\r\n\r\nSPONGIDA.\r\n\r\nThe freshwater sponges, _Spongilla fluviatilis_ and _S. lacustris_, are\r\nabundant, but no one has taken up the subject in this district, to work\r\nout the different species into which this genus is now divided.\r\n\r\nINFUSORIA.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. W. Saville Kent was preparing his manual on this subject,\r\nhe was supplied with a great variety of specimens from this district,\r\nmany of which proved to be new ones. The following are worthy of\r\nmention: _Anthophysa vegetans_, _Rhipidodendron Huxleyi_, _Spongomonas\r\nintestinalis_; various _Codosigæ_ and other Choano-flagellate\r\nmonads, including _Salpingœca Boltoni_, Kent, (new); _Euglena acus_;\r\n_Dinobryon sertularia_; _Synura uvella_; _Uroglena volvox_ (very\r\ngeneral); _Distigma proteus_; _Hemidinium nasutum_; _Peridinium\r\ntabulatum_; _Ceratium longicorne_; _Nassula ornata_; _Trachelius\r\novum_; _Spirostomum teres_, and _S. ambiguum_; _Stentor polymorphus_,\r\n_S. Barretti_, _S. cœruleus_, and _S. niger_; _Folliculina Boltoni_,\r\nKent (new.) The writer has found several free swimming Tintinnus,\r\nnot corresponding with any that Mr. W. Saville Kent enumerates;\r\n_Didinium nasutum_; _Trichodina pediculus_; _Scyphidium Fromentellii_;\r\n_Spirochona gemmipara_; _Vorticella chlorostigma_, and _V. monilata_;\r\n_Carchesium polypinum_, and _C. epistylidis_; _Zoothamnium arbuscula_;\r\n_Vaginicola tincta_; _Thuricola folliculata_; _Cothurnia imberbis_;\r\n_Ophrydium versatile_, _O. Eichhornii_, and _O. sessile_; _Stichotricha\r\nremex_; _Atineta lemnarum_, _A. grandis_, and _A. mystacina_;\r\n_Dendrosoma radians_.\r\n\r\nRHIZOPODA.\r\n\r\nThe following have been found: _Amœba proteus_, _A. verrucosa_, _A.\r\nradiosa_, and _A. villosa_; _Ouramœba vorax_; _Lithamœba vorax_,\r\nLankester (new); _Difflugia pyriformis_, _D. spiralis_, and _D.\r\ncorona_; _Cyphoderia umbella_; _Arcella vulgaris_; _Actinophrys sol_;\r\n_Raphidiophrys pallida_, and _R. elegans_; _Actinosphærium Eichhornii_;\r\n_Acanthocystis chætophora_; _Archerina Boltoni_, Lankester (new);\r\n_Clathrulina elegans_, and _Biomyxa vagans_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\nBOTANY.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY REMARKS.\r\n\r\nBY WM. MATHEWS, M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn attempting to describe the more interesting features of the\r\nindigenous Flora of the neighbourhood of Birmingham, it is necessary\r\nto define the limits of the district intended to be included. A circle\r\nof 20 miles radius, with the Town Hall as its centre, has been found\r\nconvenient as an approximate boundary. This will enclose portions of\r\nthe three counties of Warwick, Worcester, and Stafford, which meet at\r\na point on the south-western edge of the Borough, and a small part\r\nof the County of Salop. The latter, with the exception shortly to be\r\nmentioned, will be excluded from consideration. On the other hand, the\r\nradius must be extended about two miles on the south-east to take in\r\nthe town of Stratford-on-Avon, and about the same distance on the west\r\nto take in the woodlands west of the Severn from Shrawley Wood to Wyre\r\nForest near Bewdley. A part of the Forest is in Salop, and to this\r\nextent only is the latter county admitted. The district thus defined\r\ncontains an area of about 12,500 square miles. It includes the towns of\r\nBirmingham, Sutton Coldfield, Tamworth, Nuneaton, Coventry, Leamington,\r\nWarwick, Stratford, and Alcester, in the County of Warwick; of\r\nBromsgrove, Droitwich, Stourport, Bewdley, Kidderminster, Stourbridge,\r\nHalesowen, and Dudley, in Worcester; of Wolverhampton, Walsall,\r\nPenkridge, Cannock, Rugeley, and Lichfield, in Stafford.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of any district depends partly on the nature of the\r\nsoil, as determined by its geological structure, partly on altitude and\r\ndrainage areas, and partly on the character of the surface, whether\r\nwater, bog, heath, arable, pasture or woodland. The geology has been\r\ntreated of in a previous part of this volume. It will be sufficient\r\nto say here that the red rocks of the Trias occupy by far the largest\r\nportion of the area, and that calcareous soils are rare. An elevated\r\nline of country, commencing north of Wolverhampton, runs in a southerly\r\ndirection, by Sedgley, Dudley, and the Rowley Hills, to Frankley\r\nBeeches and the Upper Lickey, where it attains an altitude of about\r\n900 feet above the sea. This is the great water parting of central\r\nEngland which divides the drainage areas of the Trent and Severn. From\r\nthe Lickey, a line of lower elevation runs in a westerly direction\r\nand divides the tributaries of the Trent from those of the Avon. The\r\nsubordinate river basins and surface characteristics will be noticed in\r\nthe special articles.\r\n\r\nA brief outline of the history of the Botany of the Midland Counties\r\nmay be useful to students, and is therefore included in these remarks.\r\nIt commences with the honoured name of William Withering, one of the\r\nmost eminent of British Botanists. Born at Wellington, in Shropshire,\r\nin 1741, he practised as a physician in Birmingham, where he died in\r\n1799. The first edition of his well-known “Botanical arrangement of\r\nBritish Plants,” in two volumes, was published in 1776; the second,\r\nin three vols. in 1787; the third, in four vols. in 1796. It passed\r\nthrough five further editions, in four volumes, after his death.\r\nNumerous references to localities in the neighbourhood of Birmingham\r\nare contained in these volumes.\r\n\r\nScarcely less distinguished was Thomas Purton (1768-1833), surgeon,\r\nof Alcester, the author of “The Midland Flora.” The first two volumes\r\nof the work appeared in 1817, the third in 1821. They contain copious\r\ndescriptions of local habitats in the counties of Warwick, Worcester,\r\nand Stafford.\r\n\r\nNash’s “History of Worcestershire,” 1781, contains (Introduction\r\np. lxxxix.) a list of forty-three rare plants, two only of which,\r\n_Vaccinium Oxycoccos_ and _Comarum palustre_, recorded as growing at\r\nthe Lickey, belong to the Birmingham district. The Supplement (1799)\r\nhas a further list of forty-seven plants, four of which belong to the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe late W. G. Perry, bookseller, of Warwick, published at Warwick,\r\nin 1820, the first Flora of that county, under the title of “Plantæ\r\nVarvicenses Selectæ.” He also contributed to the Magazine of Natural\r\nHistory, Vol. iv., p. 450, 1831, a list of some of the rarer plants of\r\nWorcestershire, chiefly from the neighbourhood of Kidderminster and\r\nBewdley.\r\n\r\nThe “History of Stourbridge,” by William Scott, Stourbridge, 1832,\r\ncontains a list of plants from the neighbourhood of that town, in the\r\ncounties of Worcester and Stafford.\r\n\r\nFor a knowledge of the plants of the immediate vicinity of Birmingham,\r\nand particularly of the once celebrated “Moseley Wake Green,” Botanists\r\nare chiefly indebted to the late William Ick, Secretary of the old\r\nPhilosophical Society of Birmingham. Mr. Ick published two lists; the\r\nfirst in “The Analyst,” for 1837, Vol. vi., p. 20; the second in the\r\n“Midland Counties Herald,” Aug. 1838.\r\n\r\nThe present Mrs. Avery, then Miss M. A. Beilby, was a frequent visitor\r\nto Moseley at about that date, and has obliged the writer with a list\r\nof the rarities gathered by her at Moseley Bog and Common in 1835 and\r\n1836.\r\n\r\nA list of some of the rarer plants of the neighbourhood of Birmingham,\r\nby Saml. Freeman, appeared in the first series of the Phytologist, Vol.\r\ni., p. 261.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. W. T. Bree, Rector of Allesley, near Coventry, was a\r\nwell-known Botanist. He contributed to Purton’s Midland Flora, to\r\nthe Magazine of Natural History, and to the first series of the\r\nPhytologist, many notices of the plants of the northern part of his\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nThe first volume of the last named serial, 1844, pp. 508-514, contains\r\nan account of the ferns of Stafford, Warwick, and Worcester, from the\r\npen of the Editor, the late Edward Newman.\r\n\r\nThe second series of the Phytologist, 1855 to 1863, was edited by the\r\nlate Alexander Irvine of Chelsea. Several plants from the neighbourhood\r\nof Clent and Churchill are recorded by the Editor, in an article on the\r\n“Botany of the Clent Hills,” Vol. ii., p. 385, April, 1858.\r\n\r\nThe Studies of Warwickshire Fungi, made by the late Mrs. F. Russell, of\r\nKenilworth, will be noticed in the article on that group of plants.\r\n\r\nThe County Botany of Worcester has been associated for upwards of half\r\na century, with the name of the veteran Worcester Botanist, Mr. Edwin\r\nLees. His first observations, made in conjunction with the late Dr.\r\nStreeten, were published in Hastings’s “Illustrations of the Natural\r\nHistory of Worcestershire,” (1834). These, together with a further\r\nlist supplied by him to the late H. C. Watson, are incorporated in\r\nthe Catalogue of Worcestershire plants in “The New Botanists’ Guide,”\r\n(1835). The same work contains lists of the plants of Warwick and\r\nStafford. In 1867, Mr. Lees published his “Botany of Worcester,” the\r\nonly complete record of the flowering plants and ferns of the whole\r\ncounty, which has yet appeared. His “Botany of the Malvern Hills,”\r\nwhich has passed through three editions, relates to a part of the\r\ncounty outside the limits of the Birmingham district.\r\n\r\nThe plants of the north-east of the county are enumerated in the “Flora\r\nof the Clent and Lickey Hills,” by the present writer. First edition,\r\n1868; Second Edition, 1881. He has been indebted for assistance to many\r\nfriends, too numerous to mention in this notice.\r\n\r\n“The Natural History of Stafford,” by R. Garner, 1884, contains a list\r\nof the rarer plants of that county. Our more recent knowledge of its\r\nbotany is due to Dr. Fraser, of Wolverhampton, whose discoveries are\r\npublished in the Reports of the Botanical Record Club, 1873-1883. These\r\nreports contain also many district records communicated by the Editor,\r\nDr. F. Arnold Lees, and by Mr. J. E. Bagnall.\r\n\r\nThe modern geographical botany of Warwick is the work of members of\r\nthe Birmingham Natural History and Microscopal Society, and especially\r\nof Mr. J. E. Bagnall, Mr. A. W. Wills, and Mr. W. B. Grove. The\r\nvolumes of “The Midland Naturalist” have been enriched by numerous\r\npapers from these Botanists, for one of which, the monograph on the\r\nPilobolidæ, published in Vol. vii., 1884, the Darwin Gold Medal of the\r\nMidland Union of Natural History Societies was awarded to Mr. Grove.\r\nThose relating to the Botany of the county are, by Mr. Bagnall, “The\r\nDistribution of the Roses,” (Vol. i, 1878), “The Moss Flora,” (Vols.\r\nii. and iii., 1879-80), “The Hepaticæ,” (Vol. iii., 1880), and “The\r\nFlora of Warwickshire,” (Vols. iv.-ix., 1880-86); by Mr. Wills, “The\r\nDesmidiæ of Sutton Park,” (Vol. iii., 1880); by Mr. Grove, “The Fungi\r\nof the neighbourhood of Birmingham,” (Vols. v.-vii., 1882-84.)\r\n\r\nThe works of the late Hewett Cottrell Watson, the founder of the\r\nScience of the Geographical Botany of Great Britain, must not be\r\npassed over. Those containing provincial or comital records, besides\r\nthe new Botanists’ Guide already mentioned, are the Cybele Britannica,\r\n1847-1872; Topographical Botany, 1st edit., 1873-4, 2nd edit., 1883.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to mention that a Students’ Garden for economic\r\nand medicinal plants was laid out in 1882, in the Edgbaston Botanical\r\nGardens, from the plans of Professor Hillhouse, of Mason College, and\r\nthat a Students’ garden of British plants has been laid out, in the\r\npresent year, in Cannon Hill Park, from the plans of Mr. J. W. Oliver,\r\nteacher of Botany at the Midland Institute. For the establishment\r\nof the latter garden, students are indebted to Mr. Alderman White,\r\nchairman of the Baths and Parks Committee of the Town Council.\r\n\r\nCounty boundaries have been so generally adopted as the limits of local\r\nFloras, that it has been thought desirable to adhere to them, and to\r\ntabulate the plants separately for Warwick, Worcester, and Stafford,\r\nwhenever the materials at command have admitted of this division. The\r\nflowering plants and ferns present no difficulty, but with respect to\r\nthe lower forms of vegetation it has not always been found possible\r\nto determine their comital distribution. The plants indigenous to the\r\ndistrict are described in the following articles:--\r\n\r\nThe Flowering Plants and Ferns by Mr. J. E. Bagnall, assisted, as to\r\nWorcester, by the editor of the section, and, as to Stafford, by Dr.\r\nFraser. The Mosses, Hepatics, and Lichens, by Mr. J. E. Bagnall. The\r\nAlgæ, by Mr. A. W. Wills. The Fungi, by Mr. W. B. Grove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nThe Flowering Plants, Ferns, &c.\r\n\r\nBY J. E. BAGNALL, A.L.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flowering plants, ferns, and fern allies of the Birmingham District\r\nwill be described, as stated in the Introductory Remarks, under the\r\nheads of the three counties of Warwick, Worcester, and Stafford. The\r\ntotal flora of the district comprises upwards of 1,116 flowering plants\r\nand ferns; of these 844 are native, 143 are varieties, 14 aliens, 42\r\ncolonists, and 73 are denizens. The nomenclature adopted is that of the\r\n7th edition of the “London Catalogue of British Plants.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWARWICK.\r\n\r\nThe Warwickshire portion of the district comprises the greater part\r\nof North Warwickshire, with a portion of South Warwickshire. It is\r\nwatered by the Tame, with its affluents the Rea, Cole, Blythe, Bourne,\r\nand Anker; and the Avon with its affluents the Leam, Sow, Alne, and\r\nArrow. The greatest elevations occur at Hartshill, Dosthill, Corley,\r\nAlne Hills, and Arrow, none of which exceed 550 feet above the\r\nsea. As a whole it is well wooded, but the woods are usually small\r\nand not productive of the rarer woodland species. Heath lands are\r\nmostly reclaimed, and the more extensive marshes and bogs drained,\r\nhence ericetal and bog plants are rare. It has been divided into the\r\nfollowing sub-districts, bounded by the water partings of the river\r\nbasins:--I. TAME, II. BLYTHE, III. ANKER, IV. AVON, V. SOW, VI. ALNE,\r\nVII. ARROW.\r\n\r\nIn presenting an account of the rarer plants as full a list from each\r\nsub-district (as space permits) will be given, but many of the plants\r\ncited for one or other sub-district may also be found in one or more of\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nThe plants marked by an asterisk* before the name are probably extinct.\r\n\r\nI. TAME.--This sub-district embraces all those portions of the Tame\r\nvalley not drained by the Blythe or Anker, and includes Sutton,\r\nMiddleton, Water Orton, Kingsbury, Shustoke, and Arley.

This sub-district is mostly flat,\r\nthe soils are usually sand, marl, and clay. Heath lands occur near\r\nEarlswood and Coleshill; bogs and marshes near Coleshill and Barston.\r\nThe recorded flora is about 820 flowering plants and ferns, the\r\nfollowing being the more noteworthy:--\r\n\r\n    Thalictrum flavum; Aquilegia vulgaris; Drosera rotundifolia;\r\n    Cerastium arvense; Sagina ciliata; *Elatine hexandra;\r\n    Hypericum elodes; Geranium pyrenaicum; Genista tinctoria;\r\n    Vicia tetrasperma; Rubus suberectus, R. adornatus; Rosa\r\n    micrantha, R. surculosa, R. obtusifolia, R.

ANKER.--The Anker rises about 3 miles S.E. of Bedworth, drains the\r\ncountry about Bedworth, Nuneaton, Atherstone, Polesworth and Tamworth,\r\nand enters the Tame at Tamworth. The country it waters is usually flat,\r\nbut on its left bank at Hartshill and Polesworth there is rising ground\r\nabout 500 feet above sea level. In this sub-district the Warwickshire\r\ncoalfields occur, and it is possibly due to the great prevalence of\r\nsmoke that its flora is meagre and the plants often depauperated.

Its course is through Henley-in-Arden, near here\r\nit is joined by an important tributary draining the country between\r\nHenley, Lapworth, and Rowington. This sub-district is somewhat hilly,\r\nthe Alne Hills being the highest elevations. It includes Tanworth,\r\nHenley-in-Arden, Bearley, Alne, Wilmcote, Claverdon, Hatton, Rowington.\r\nThe Lias soils prevail in southern part of the district.

This sub-district is well wooded; the soils are mostly\r\nKeuper marls and sand, with Lias soils prevailing about Wixford. The\r\nflora has not been fully worked out, but the record is now about 706\r\nflowering plants and ferns; among the more noteworthy are:--\r\n\r\n    Ranunculus circinatus; Berberis vulgaris; Sinapis nigra;\r\n    Silene noctiflora; Euonymus Europæus; Trifolium striatum; Rosa\r\n    spinossisma; Pyrus communis; *Sedum Telephium; Ribes nigrum;\r\n    Bupleurum rotundifolium; Torilis infesta; Adoxa Moschatellina;\r\n    Viburnum Lantana; Carduus crispus, C.

It is watered by\r\nthe Cole and Rea, tributaries to the Tame, by the Stour and Salwarp,\r\ntributaries to the Severn, by the Severn itself, and by the Arrow and\r\nminor streams tributaries to the Avon. A range of hills about eight\r\nmiles long runs across the country from north-west to south-east, and\r\narticulates with the central water parting at Bromsgrove Lickey. It\r\nincludes Clent, Walton and Romsley Hills, Frankley Beeches, the Upper\r\nand the Lower Lickey, and rises in Walton Hill, to a maximum height of\r\n1036 feet above the sea. The Worcestershire portion of the district\r\nhas been divided into the following eight sub-districts, distinguished\r\nby the Roman numerals I. to VIII. It has not been found convenient in\r\nevery case to adopt water partings as sub-divisional boundaries.\r\n\r\nI. REA. II. CLENT AND LICKEY. III. STOUR. IV. EAST SEVERN. V. WEST\r\nSEVERN. VI.

Surface strata: Waterstones,\r\nsoft red Bunter, Permian breccia, Coal measures, Old red sandstone.\r\nThis sub-district extends somewhat beyond the twenty miles radius. It\r\nis chiefly remarkable for the large area of woodland known as Wyre\r\nForest, which produces a number of rarities not found elsewhere within\r\nthe County. Part of the forest is in Salop.

SALWARP.--Country from the S.W. foot of the Lickey Hills, to the\r\nSalwarp below Droitwich. Surface strata: Red Marl, Waterstones. The\r\nmost noticeable features are the extensive tract of woodland known as\r\nthe Randans, and the Salt Works of Stoke and Droitwich. The latter have\r\nrendered the canals and streams in the vicinity more or less saline.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic plants are--\r\n\r\n    Geranium lucidum, G.

The plants of the\r\nsaline waters of Droitwich deserve separate mention. They are--\r\n\r\n    Lepidum ruderale, L. latifolium; Spergularia salina: Apium\r\n    graveolens; Samolus Valerandi; Glaux maritima; Juncus Gerardi;\r\n    Sclerochloa distans.\r\n\r\nVIII. AVON.--The country about Feckenham on the streams tributary to\r\nthe Avon, is situated partly on the Lias, and partly on the Red Marl.\r\nIt is the only one of the eight sub-districts in which the Lias occurs.\r\nThe following plants are principally characteristic of the calcareous\r\nsoil of the Lias--\r\n\r\n    Trifolium fragiferum; Lotus tenuis; Melilotus officinalis;\r\n    Astragalus glycyphyllus; Lathyrus Nissolia; Poterium muricatum;\r\n    Sison Amomum; Conium maculatum; Pastinaca sativa; Torilis\r\n    nodosa; Picris hieracioides; Helminthia echioides; Campanula\r\n    latifolia; Lithospermum arvense; Daphne Laureola; Ophrys\r\n    apifera.\r\n\r\nA large tract of bog land known as Feckenham Moor existed in this\r\nsub-district in the time of Purton, and produced the following plants,\r\nrecorded in his “Midland Flora”--\r\n\r\n    Parnassia palustris; Hydrocotyle vulgaris; Carduus pratensis;\r\n    Pinguicula vulgaris; Triglochin palustre; Alisma ranunculoides;\r\n    Schœnus nigricans; Cladium Mariscus.\r\n\r\nThe moor was drained many years ago, and its plants are all extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAFFORD.\r\n\r\nThe Staffordshire portion of the district extends from Upper Arley,\r\non the west to Penkridge and Rugeley on the north, and to Tamworth\r\non the east. The parish of Dudley, which, although in Worcester is\r\nentirely surrounded by Stafford, will be treated as part of the latter\r\ncounty. The principal elevations are the Silurian Hills of Dudley\r\nCastle, 550 feet, and of the Wren’s Nest, 500 feet above the sea,\r\nsituated on the central water parting. West of these are Kinver Edge,\r\n550 feet, and on the east Barr Beacon, 654 feet. It is watered on\r\nthe west by the Severn, on the north and east by the Trent and Tame,\r\nand other tributary streams. It produces on the whole an interesting\r\nflora, notwithstanding the fact that the South Staffordshire Coalfield\r\nwith the collieries and iron works, so destructive to vegetation, is\r\nincluded within its limits. The sub-districts adopted are: I. SEVERN,\r\nII. TRENT, III. TAME.\r\n\r\nI.

E. BAGNALL, A.L.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn describing the rarer Mosses, Hepatics and Lichens, to be found\r\nwithin the district, the materials at command are not sufficient\r\nto admit of so minute an analysis of distribution as that given\r\nfor the flowering plants in the preceding pages. For the mosses\r\nfour sub-districts will be adopted: I. WARWICK, TAME; II. WARWICK,\r\nAVON; III. WORCESTER; IV. STAFFORD. For the Hepatics and Lichens,\r\nthe enumeration will be restricted to Warwick only; information for\r\nWorcester and Stafford not being within reach. The nomenclature of the\r\nMosses and Hepatics is that of the “London Catalogue of British Mosses\r\nand Hepatics,” 2nd Edit., 1881. The nomenclature of the Lichens is that\r\nof “The Lichen Flora,” of the Revd. W. A. Leighton, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSSES.\r\n\r\nThe Moss Flora of the whole district under review, so far as records\r\nare available, is about 272 species and varieties; that of Warwickshire\r\nalone being about 261. Its comparative poverty may be attributed,\r\npartly to the absence of great elevations, partly to the prevalence of\r\nsmoke over large portions of the district, and partly to the draining\r\nof bogs and marshes, and reclamation of heath lands.\r\n\r\nI. WARWICK, TAME.--This sub-district includes that portion of the\r\ncountry watered by the Tame and its affluents, the Cole, Blythe,\r\nBourne, and Anker. The following are the more noticeable mosses.\r\n\r\n    Sphagnum fimbriatum, S. squarrosum, S. rubellum, S. papillosum,\r\n    S. cymbifolium, var. squarrosulum; Systegium crispum; *Dicranum\r\n    spurium, D. fuscescens, D. majus; Campylopus flexuosus;\r\n    Archidium phascoides; Pleuridium alternifolium; Leucobryum\r\n    glaucum; Sphærangium muticum; Pottia minutula; Trichostomum\r\n    tophaceum; Tortula aloides, T. marginata, T. rigidula, T.\r\n    spadicea, T. insulana, T. tortuosa, T. subulata, T. papillosa;\r\n    Encalypta streptocarpa; Racomitrium canescens; Zygodon\r\n    viridissimus; Ulota intermedia; Ephemerum serratum; Funaria\r\n    fasciculare; Bryum pallescens, B. roseum; Mnium rostratum,\r\n    M. stellare, M. subglobosum; Polytrichum gracile; Fissidens\r\n    adiantoides, F. exilis; Leucodon sciuroides; Amblyodon\r\n    dealbatus; Philonotis fontana; Homalia trichomanoides;\r\n    *Hedwigia ciliata; Brachythecium albicans; Eurhynchium\r\n    speciosum, E.

Cossoni, H. vernicosum, H. falcatum, H.\r\n    giganteum, H. stramineum, H. revolvens.\r\n\r\nII. WARWICK, AVON.--This sub-district includes that portion of Avon\r\nwithin the area, and its affluents, the Sow, Alne, and Arrow. The\r\nfollowing are the more rare mosses:--\r\n\r\n    Sphagnum auriculatum, S. subsecundum; Gymnostomum tenue;\r\n    Dicranum montanum; D. scoparium; Campylopus pyriformis;\r\n    Pottia intermedia, P. cavifolia, var. incana; Tortula rigida,\r\n    T. ambigua, T. atro-virens, T.

WORCESTER.--The moss flora of this sub-district has not been\r\npublished; but the moss herbaria of Mr. Mathews and the writer afford\r\nrecords of about 127 species. Many of these have already been recorded\r\nfor Warwick, and are therefore omitted here. The following, which are\r\nmainly from the Stour sub-district, are the more noteworthy:--\r\n\r\n    Sphagnum auriculatum; S. cuspidatum, S. intermedium; Dicranum\r\n    scoparium; Leucobryum glaucum; Pleuridium nitidum; Pottia\r\n    Wilsoni, P. intermedia; Tortula cuneifolia, T. convoluta;\r\n    Encalypta vulgaris, E. streptocarpa; Racomitrium aciculare,\r\n    R. lanuginosum, R. fasiculare; Ptychomitrium polyphyllum;\r\n    Ulota intermedia; Orthotrichum Lyellii; Ephemerum serratum;\r\n    Physcomitrella patens; Amblyodon dealbatus; Philonotis\r\n    fontana; Leptobryum pyriforme; Bryum pendulum, B. roseum;\r\n    Mnium stellare; Aulacomnium palustre; Fissidens exilis, F.\r\n    adiantoides; Fontinalis antipyretica; Neckera crispa; Homalia\r\n    trichomanoides; Pterygophyllum lucens; Climacium dendroides;\r\n    Brachythecium populeum; Rhynchostegium murale; Hypnum\r\n    commutatum, H. palustre, H. chrysophyllum; *H. scorpioides.\r\n\r\nIV. STAFFORD.--The record given in Garner’s Natural History of\r\nStaffordshire, of the mosses of that county, refers to localities\r\nwhich are all outside the area. Hence it is impossible to do more than\r\nmention the rarer species collected by myself, mostly within a ten mile\r\nradius of Birmingham, and a few additional records supplied by Dr.\r\nFraser. They are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Dicranella cerviculata, D. rufescens, D. crispa; Dicranum\r\n    Scoparium, D. palustre, D. majus; Pleuridium nitidum; Tortula\r\n    Hornschuchiana, T. ambigua, T. aloides; Didymodon rubellus;\r\n    Pottia lanceolata, P. intermedia, P. minutula; Ephemerum\r\n    serratum; Encalypta streptocarpa; Philonotis fontana; Bartramia\r\n    pomiformis; Webera carnea, W. annotina; Bryum pendulum, B.\r\n    atro-purpureum, B. cuspidatum; Polytrichum strictum; Fissidens\r\n    adiantoides; Tetraphis pellucida; Entosthodon fasciculare;\r\n    Brachythecium populeum, B. albicans; Eurhynchium murale,\r\n    E. Teesdalii; Plagiothecium elegans, P. undulatum; Hypnum\r\n    intermedium, H. chrysophyllum, H. vernicosum, H. giganteum.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEPATICÆ.\r\n\r\nThe Hepaticæ and Lichens are poorly represented, and as no available\r\nrecord of these plants occurs, only those of the Warwickshire portion\r\nof the district will be given.\r\n\r\nOf the Hepaticæ only about 41 species have as yet been found, the more\r\nnoteworthy being:--\r\n\r\n    Fossombronia pusilla; Madotheca platyphylla; Radula complanata;\r\n    Scapania nemorosa, S. irrigua; Plagiochila nemorosa; Aplozia\r\n    crenulata, A. sphærocarpa; Gymnocolea inflata; Jungermannia\r\n    ventricosa; Cephalozia byssacea, C. Starkii, *C. curvifolia,\r\n    C. connivens; Trichocolea tomentella; Metzgeria furcata;\r\n    Aneura multifida, A. sinuata, A. pinguis; Lunularia cruciata;\r\n    Conocephalus conicus; Anthoceros punctatus, A. lævis; Riccia\r\n    glauca; Ricciella fluitans.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICHENS.\r\n\r\nSo far as experience serves the Lichen flora of the district appears\r\nto be very limited. From Worcestershire I have seen no records except\r\nthat probably exhaustive one by Mr. Edwin Lees in his “Botany and\r\nGeology of Malvern,” where we find about 240 species recorded for\r\nthe Malvern district, but outside the area under notice here. For\r\nStaffordshire, Garner records about 51 species, few of which are\r\nlocalised, and those few are outside the area.\r\n\r\nIn Purton’s “Midland Flora,” a fair record is given of these plants\r\nfor the Midland district, several of the species there recorded are,\r\nhowever, now either assigned to other orders as algæ or fungi, or\r\nare considered to be imperfect states of other lichens. So far as it\r\nis possible to judge from Purton’s records, and the observations of\r\nthe present writer, the Lichen flora of that part of Warwickshire\r\nwithin the area here adopted comprises about 100 species, of which the\r\nfollowing are some of the more noticeable:--\r\n\r\n    Collema nigrescens; Calcium trichiale, C. hyperellum, C.\r\n    trachelinum; Trachylia tympanella; Cladonia alcicornis, C.\r\n    furcata, C. rangifera, C. uncialis; Stereocaulon paschale;\r\n    Usnea hirta; Alectoria jubata; Evernia furfuracca: Ramulina\r\n    fraxinea, R. fastigiata; Cetraria aculeata; Peltigera\r\n    rufescens, P. polydactyle; Sticta pulmonacea; Parmelia\r\n    olivacea, P. caperata, P. lanata, P. perlata; Physcia ciliaris,\r\n    P. pulverulenta, P. stellaris; Pannaria pezizoides, P. nigra;\r\n    Lecanora candelaria, L. pruinosa, L. parella, L. atra, L.\r\n    sulphurea, L. ferruginea; Urceolaria scruposa; Pertusaria\r\n    communis; Phylictis agelæa; Lecidea æruginosa, L. quernea,\r\n    L. parasema, L. fusco-ater; Graphis scripta, G. serpentina;\r\n    Opegrapha atra, O. notha; Arthonia astroidea, A. Swartziana;\r\n    Verrucaria gemmata, V. epidermidis, V. nitida.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThe Algæ.\r\n\r\nBY A. W. WILLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great class of Algæ includes the sea-weeds, together with a large\r\nnumber of plants, mostly of microscopic size and of simple cellular\r\nstructure, which abound wherever fresh water is found, whether in the\r\nform of running streams or stagnant pools, or even as covering damp\r\nsurfaces of ground.\r\n\r\nA broad subdivision of the Algæ into three groups has been generally\r\naccepted by botanists, these being the Rhodosporeæ (red-spored),\r\nMelanosporeæ (dark-spored), and Chlorosporeæ (green-spored). The marine\r\ngenera are distributed over all three of these groups; the freshwater\r\nones belong almost exclusively to the last. The classification of\r\nthe freshwater Chlorosperms is by no means satisfactory, but it is\r\nimpossible to discuss it within the limits of this article.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that scarcely any of the botanists of Birmingham\r\nhave made the Algæ their special study; hence the information at our\r\ndisposal is insufficient to enable us to group the recorded species\r\nwith reference to their occurrence in the several adjacent counties.\r\nThis is, however, the less important because the distribution of\r\nthis class of plants is not dependent, to the same extent as that\r\nof Phænogams, either on climate or soil, though it is probably not\r\naltogether independent of either. Their abundance, therefore, is in\r\npretty direct proportion to that of such spaces of water as afford\r\nfavourable conditions for their growth.\r\n\r\nHence, as the neighbourhood of Birmingham is mostly characterised by\r\nlight and porous soils, the habitats in which Algæ are to be found are\r\nsomewhat restricted. There are, however, two conspicuous exceptions.\r\nThe tract of land about seven miles from Birmingham, known as Sutton\r\nPark, embraces a singular variety of scenery and presents conditions\r\nhighly favourable to algoid growth in the shape of clear springs and\r\nstreams, large sheets of water, and a considerable area of peaty bogs.\r\nAgain, the mining district of South Staffordshire and Worcestershire,\r\npopularly known as the Black Country, affords among its pit-banks a\r\ngreat number of pools which are seldom dried up even in the hottest\r\nsummer, and many of which are partially fed by water from adjacent\r\nmines or engines. Their number has been much diminished during the last\r\nfew years by the operations of the South Staffordshire Mines Drainage\r\nCommission, but is still very large and these constitute a rich hunting\r\nground to the student of freshwater Algæ.\r\n\r\nThe brief notes which follow must be regarded merely as an indication\r\nof the general character of this branch of the Midland Flora. Any\r\nattempt systematically to enumerate the recorded species would far\r\nexceed the necessary limits of this notice.\r\n\r\nThe great group of so-called Unicellular Algæ is universally\r\ndistributed, and the familiar forms included under the ill-defined\r\ngenera of Pleurococcus, Glœocystis, Tetraspora, Pediastrum, &c., are\r\nfound abundantly in this district wherever conditions favourable to\r\ntheir growth are present. Among these low forms may be mentioned\r\n_Apiocystis Brauniana_, parasitic on larger Algæ in stagnant pools;\r\nthe extremely rare _Mischococcus confervicola_, recorded as found near\r\nStafford, and _Polyedrium tetrahedricum_ found on decaying leaves in a\r\nsmall pit near Sutton. _Ophiocytium cochleare_, until lately regarded\r\nas a very scarce plant, is not uncommon in similar habitats.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable _Hydrodictyon utriculatum_, popularly known as “Water\r\nNet,” appeared some years ago in Blackroot Pool, Sutton Park, in\r\nenormous quantities, but shortly disappeared and has not been seen\r\nthere since. It has also been recorded by Mr. T. Bolton as found in\r\nBourne Pool, near Aldridge.\r\n\r\nThe large tribe of Volvocineæ is represented by the well-known\r\nforms of Gonium, Pandorina, and Eudorina, and by the typical _Volvox\r\nglobator_, which, as is its wont, occasionally appears in some of\r\nthe pools of the district in great profusion, only to vanish as\r\ncapriciously. Mr. Bolton has recorded the rare and interesting _Volvox\r\nglobator_ ♂,--the _Sphærosira volvox_ of Ehrenberg--as occurring in the\r\nsmall pool in the gravel pit near Blackroot Pool, Sutton Park.\r\n\r\nPassing to the Zygnemaceæ, Vaucheriaceæ and other filamentous Algæ,\r\nwe find a large number of species of Zygnema, Spirogyra, Zygogonium,\r\nMesocarpus, Staurocarpus, Vaucheria, &c., occupying ditches, small\r\npools and other stagnant waters; it is scarcely possible to take a\r\nbottleful of water from these stations in summer and autumn without\r\nfinding examples of the curious modes of reproduction characteristic of\r\nthese genera.\r\n\r\nIn running streams and in the still ponds of the district the long\r\nfronds of Enteromorpha, the dense tresses of brilliant green Cladophoræ\r\nand the graceful tufts of Stigeoclonium and Chætophora abound. The\r\nexquisite _Cœtophora endiviæfolia_ reappears at intervals in Keeper’s\r\nPool, Sutton Park; this species has also been found by Mr. Bolton in an\r\nold gravel pit at Hill Hook and in Earlswood reservoir.\r\n\r\nThe elegant _Bulbochœte setigera_ is met with in small fragments in\r\nstagnant pools, and the singular _Coleochœte scutata_ is to be found\r\nadherent to submerged water weeds.\r\n\r\nThe tepid waters of the South Staffordshire coal district are specially\r\nfavourable to the growth of Oscillatorieæ, which form on their margins\r\nimmense sheets of the deepest green velvet.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of Batrachospermum (among which _B. atrum_ is locally\r\nthe rarest, having been found at Halesowen only) occur in small masses\r\nin clear streams, but they must be regarded as somewhat scarce plants.\r\n_Lemania fluviatilis_ should be mentioned as common in the Avon and\r\nSevern, and the very rare _Bangia atropurpurea_ as occurring on a water\r\nwheel in the former river at Stratford-on-Avon, although these habitats\r\nare somewhat beyond the limits contemplated in this sketch.\r\n\r\nThe Diatomaceæ of the neighbourhood do not appear to have been the\r\nobjects of systematic study, and the only species of special interest\r\nwhich we remember to have found is the wonderful _Bacillaria paradoxa_,\r\nwell known as a remarkable microscopic object from the strange manner\r\nin which its linear frustules glide over one another, so that the whole\r\nplant is incessantly assuming a different form. It has been found by\r\nMr. Bolton, along with many other species, in a disused arm of the\r\ncanal near Albion Station, and by the writer in a small stream near the\r\nsame spot. A careful search would doubtless result in the discovery of\r\na large number of representative species of this class.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we turn for a moment to the very beautiful tribe of\r\nDesmidieæ, and, although the district by no means abounds in the peaty\r\nbogs which are their especial haunts, a goodly list of ordinary species\r\nhas been recorded. Sutton Park is the best locality for these plants,\r\nand in addition to the commoner forms of Micrasterias, Euastrum,\r\nClosterium, &c., which are here found in abundance, this habitat has\r\nyielded many rare and several new species, among which the following\r\nare worthy of special notice, viz.:--_Micrasterias papillifera_, _M.\r\nCruxmelitensis_, _M. angulosa_, _M. denticulata_, var. _lichmoides_,\r\nand _M. Americana, forma major_; _Cosmarium coronatum_, _Closterium\r\ndirectum_, _Cl. angustatum_, and _Cl. Pritchardianum_; _Penium\r\nclosteriodes_, _P. Jenneri_, and _P. Nägeli_.\r\n\r\nA more detailed list of species is inadmissible, but the foregoing\r\nbrief sketch will suffice to show that the Freshwater Algæ of the\r\nneighbourhood are tolerably abundant, and by no means devoid of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nThe Fungi.\r\n\r\nBY W. B. GROVE, B.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe district of which Birmingham is the centre is in some ways\r\npeculiarly interesting to a British Mycologist. It was the scene of\r\nthe labours of two students of British Fungi who will always hold an\r\nhonourable place in the history of the development of the science in\r\nthis country--William Withering and Thomas Purton.\r\n\r\nWithering was in his time (1741-1799) the foremost physician of this\r\ntown. He lived for many years at Edgbaston Hall, a residence still\r\nsituated among picturesque scenery just on the edge of the town, and\r\nthen no doubt a wilder and more productive spot than now. Many species\r\nand varieties of Fungi new to Britain or new to science rewarded his\r\nconstant researches in the park surrounding the hall, and some of the\r\nforms which he described still linger in this retreat. Packington Park,\r\nabout ten miles from the town, is another locality frequently quoted\r\nby him; in fact by far the great majority of the species found by\r\nWithering himself came from these two places.\r\n\r\nWithering enjoys the distinction of being one of the earliest\r\nauthors on the British Flora, who devoted to the Fungi a space even\r\ndecently comparable with that devoted to the Flowering plants. In\r\nhis “Arrangement of British plants” (3rd edition), 1286 species of\r\nPhanerogams are recorded, and 566 of Fungi, which thus fill more than\r\none-third as much space as their superiors in rank.\r\n\r\nThomas Purton was a surgeon of Alcester, a town about 18 miles from\r\nBirmingham. In his “Midland Flora” (1817-1821), he gives descriptions\r\nof over 400 species of Fungi, found chiefly in the neighbourhood of\r\nAlcester, especially in Oversley Wood and Ragley Park. He provides\r\nmoreover excellent coloured engravings of 35 species. Since the whole\r\nnumber of Flowering Plants recorded by Purton from the Midlands is only\r\n798, it will be seen that he surpasses Withering in devoting more than\r\nhalf as much space to the Fungi as to the Phanerogams.\r\n\r\nMrs. Russell, of Kenilworth, made, a few years since, a nearly\r\nexhaustive study of the Hymenomycetes of Kenilworth, Stoneleigh, and\r\nWarwick, and bequeathed to the British Museum her valuable series of\r\nover 300 coloured illustrations. But with this exception little has\r\nbeen done recently to elucidate the Fungi of the neighbourhood of this\r\ntown, until the subject was taken up, within the last few years, by Mr.\r\nJ. E. Bagnall and the writer. On reckoning up the number of species now\r\nknown to occur in this district it will be found that they considerably\r\nexceed 900. It is probable that the district is as productive as any\r\nother in the smaller and microscopic kinds, but the larger species of\r\nFungi are, with few exceptions, not to be found in any great abundance.\r\n\r\nFrom want of sufficient material, it is not possible to treat this\r\ngroup successfully, as has been done with the Phanerogams, according\r\nto the counties. It will be preferable merely to string together short\r\nnotices of a few of the more remarkable or uncommon kinds, according to\r\nthe orders into which the class “Fungi” is divided. The names are those\r\nof Stevenson’s “Hymenomycetes Britannici,” so far as it is published,\r\nand of Cooke’s “Handbook” or “Grevillea” for the rest.\r\n\r\nThe first and most conspicuous of these orders is the Hymenomycetes,\r\nthe mushroom and toad-stool family, of which the common mushroom\r\nmay be taken as the type. These are all distinguished by having the\r\nspore-bearing cells arranged in a more or less continuous exposed\r\nsurface, even or variously folded. In the more typical species, this\r\nsurface assumes the form of the flat laminæ which are termed gills. Of\r\nthese, _Agaricus nitidus_ has been found at Coleshill Pool; the yellow\r\nvariety of _Ag. cepæstipes_ at Sutton Coldfield; _Ag. polystictus_ and\r\n_Ag. pessundatus_, near Kenilworth; _Ag. stans_ in Edgbaston Park;\r\n_Ag. virgatus_, both there and at Coleshill Pool; _Ag. inornatus_ at\r\nKenilworth; _Ag. tuba_, at Middleton; _Ag. ditopus_, there and in\r\nEdgbaston Park; _Ag. platyphyllus_ frequently in and near Sutton Park;\r\n_Ag. rancidus_ at Middleton; _Ag. pullatus_, at Coleshill Pool; _Ag.\r\nleucogalus_, at New Park, Middleton; _Ag. electicus_, on rush stems in\r\nSutton Park; _Ag. subpalmatus_, at Kenilworth and near Studley Castle;\r\n_Ag. petaloides_, var. _spathulatus_, at Oversley; _Ag. volvaceus_,\r\n_Ag. speciosus_, and _Ag. umbrosus_, at Kenilworth; _Ag. jubatus_,\r\nnear Barnt Green; _Ag. heteroclitus_, many striking and well developed\r\nspecimens at Sutton Coldfield; and _Ag. lanuginosus_, in Oversley Wood.\r\n_Ag. horizontalis_ is said by Purton to be “not rare” near Alcester,\r\nand he records _Ag. erinaceus_ and _Ag. pezizoides_ from the same\r\nlocality. _Ag. echinatus_, with its remarkable blood-red gills, is\r\nfound frequently at Sutton Coldfield. At this point in the systematic\r\norder comes in the mysterious _Ag. versicolor_ of Withering, of which\r\nhe found only a few specimens in Edgbaston Park, and which has never\r\nsince been seen by any other author; yet neither Fries nor the others\r\nventure to omit it, because Withering gives so clear and unmistakeable\r\na description as almost to preclude the possibility of error. _Ag.\r\nluteonitens_ and _Ag. sarcocephalus_ have been found at Kenilworth;\r\n_Ag. udus_ is common in Sutton Park and the neighbourhood, and is also\r\nfound among the Lickey Hills, accompanied in the latter place by the\r\nvariety _polytrichi_. _Ag. areolatus_ has been found at Warwick; _Ag.\r\natrorufus_ at Sutton; _Ag. retirugis_ at Kenilworth and Middleton; and\r\nBolton’s _Ag. cinctulus_ (“History of Funguses,” tab. 152), which is\r\nomitted by Fries as possibly incorrectly figured, is said by Purton to\r\nbe “not rare” near Alcester.\r\n\r\nOf the genera allied to Agaricus, the rare species found here are\r\nrather few. The district seems to be especially ill supplied with the\r\nlarger Cortinarii. Scarcely more than thirty species of this genus\r\nare recorded, of which the following may be mentioned:--_Cortinarius\r\ncyanipes_, from Kenilworth; _C. callochrous_, from Edgbaston; _C.\r\nscaurus_, from Packington; _C. violaceus_, which seems to have\r\nbeen found by Purton; _C. callisteus_ and _C. ochroleucus_, from\r\nKenilworth; _C. sanguineus_, in Sutton Park; _C. bulbosus_, from\r\nOversley; _C. armillatus_, at Coleshill Pool; _C. brunneus_ (recorded\r\nonly by Withering among British authors), in Packington Park; and _C.\r\nhemitrichus_, in Sutton Park.\r\n\r\nThe other gilled genera may be briefly dismissed. _Gomphidius viscidus_\r\nand _G. glutinosus_ have both occurred in the district. Lactarii are\r\nnot uncommon. _L. deliciosus_ is frequent in a certain part of Sutton\r\nPark, and is recorded by both Withering and Purton; it also occurs at\r\nHagley and at Bromsgrove Lickey, but is very local. _L. turpis_, of\r\nlarge size, abounds in several woods in the neighbourhood of Sutton;\r\n_L. cilicioides_, _L. uvidus_, _L. hysginus_, _L. zonarius_, _L.\r\npyrogalus_, _L. glyciosmus_, and _L. camphoratus_, in addition to the\r\nmore common species, have all been found; as also _Russula delica_, _R.\r\nrosacea_, _R. citrina_, _R. lutea_, and the very rare _R. drimeia_,\r\n_Hygrophorus chrysodon_ and _H. russo-coriaceus_ have been found\r\nat Kenilworth; Purton found the pretty little _Marasmius Hudsoni_;\r\n_Lentinus tigrinus_ is recorded by Withering, from Packington Park;\r\n_L. adhœrens_ by both Withering and Purton; and _L. lepideus_ and _L.\r\ncochleatus_ have been met with several times. _Panus conchatus_ was\r\nfound by Withering at Edgbaston, and by Purton at Studley, and the\r\nwriter has found _P. torulosus_ in Packington Park.\r\n\r\nAmong the pore-bearing Hymenomycetes, the most striking and rare\r\nis _Boletus (Strobilomyces) strobilaceus_, found at “the Valley,”\r\nBromsgrove, in 1861. _Boletus badius_ is rather common, and is an\r\nedible species. The rare _B. parasiticus_ has been found at Middleton;\r\n_B. striæpes_ and _B. olivaceus_ are also on record. The writer has\r\nfound the true _Polyporus frondosus Fr._ once in Sutton Park, and fine\r\nspecimens of _P. giganteus_ in Edgbaston Park. Purton records _P.\r\nheteroclitus_ from Oversley, and _P. molluscus_ is occasionally found\r\nat Sutton and Coleshill Pool. The curious _Ptychogaster albus_, which\r\nis now usually considered a conidial form of a Polyporus, called _P.\r\nptychogaster_, has occurred in Sutton Park on stumps of firs. _Trametes\r\ngibbosa_ is found at Sutton; _Dædalea confragosa_ in the coppice near\r\nWindley Pool; and the edible _Fistulina hepatica_ is occasionally met\r\nwith on old oaks in Sutton Park, Hagley Park, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nDismissing the rest of the Hymenomycetes, in which there is little\r\nworthy of mention to record, we come to the Gastromycetes, or Puff-ball\r\nfamily, in which the spore-bearing surface is more or less concealed\r\nwithin an outer coating, and most frequently breaks up into a dusty\r\nmass. The Myxomycetes, which were formerly included in this group,\r\nwill here be placed in their proper position at the end of the Fungi.\r\nOf the aberrant group to which the common Stinkhorn (not very common\r\nin this district) belongs, the more brilliant _Cynophallus caninus_ is\r\nrecorded by Purton, from near Bridgnorth, and was found at Bromsgrove\r\nLickey, in 1856. The very rare and remarkable Earth-star, _Geaster\r\ncoliformis_, has not been found in the district to which this notice\r\nis limited, but it has been twice found in the county of Worcester.\r\nThe localities are given as “near Hanley Castle, Worcestershire,” _Mr.\r\nBallard_, by Withering; and “Hanley Common, Worcestershire,” _Mr.\r\nRufford_, by Purton. In the same place _Geaster fornicatus_ occurred,\r\nand this is said by Withering to have been found also “at Birches\r\nGreen, near Birmingham.” _G. limbatus_ is recorded from Edgbaston Park,\r\nStonebridge, Allesley, Oversley, and Rushford.\r\n\r\nAnother group of Fungi is that which grows upon living leaves, the\r\nvarious forms of which are known as Cluster-cups, Rust, Smut and Brand.\r\nThese are what are usually called Leaf-Fungi. Many species are common\r\nhere; but, as most kinds grow only upon certain specified plants, it\r\nfollows that their range is determined in great measure by the presence\r\nor absence of their hosts. _Podisoma sabinæ_ and _P. juniperi_ have\r\nbeen found in the district. The only rare cluster-cup recorded is\r\n_Œcidium depauperans_, which occurs every summer on cultivated Violas\r\nin a few localities, and in one of these it is uniformly accompanied\r\nand followed by the Puccinia, to which the name of _Puccinia ægra_ has\r\nbeen given by the writer. Till lately this Œcidium was not known to\r\noccur out of the United Kingdom, but Professor Trelease, of St. Louis,\r\nin a private letter says that he has recently seen in the United States\r\nspecimens apparently identical with it. _Puccinia sonchi_ was found by\r\nMr. Hawkes, near Great Barr, on seedlings of Sonchus, and as yet has\r\nnot been found anywhere else in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe species of the next group, the Discomycetes, or Cup-fungi, are not\r\nuncommon, though few of the showy forms are to be seen. The common\r\nMorell occurs, sparingly in the district, and _Morchella semilibera_\r\nis recorded from Badsey. _Helvella crispa_, _H. lacunosa_, _H.\r\nelastica_; _Mitrula paludosa_; _Spathularia flavida_; _Leotia lubrica_;\r\n_Geoglossum glabrum_, _G. hirsutum_, and _Rhizina undulata_ have all\r\nbeen found, though rarely. Among the minuter species may be mentioned\r\n_Peziza dematiicola_, of which the writer found a few specimens at\r\nSutton two years ago, this being the first and at present the only\r\nlocality cited, since the place where the original specimens of\r\nBerkeley were discovered is unknown. _P. asperior_ has been found at\r\nBerkswell (the only British locality); the curious _P. Curreiana_, on\r\nrush stems in Sutton Park and elsewhere; and the rare _P. Crouani_, _P.\r\nDalmeniensis_, _P. stereicola_; _Ascobolus minutissimus_; _Vibrissea\r\nleptospora_; _Propolis pyri_, and a new species which Mr. Phillips has\r\nnamed _Dermatea nectrioides_, at various places in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe next group of Fungi is the Pyrenomycetes or Globe-fungi. They\r\noccur usually on dead bark and wood, or stalks of plants, and are\r\nmostly black, more rarely red or brown. Several common species\r\nlook like grains of gunpowder scattered over the wood. Among these\r\nWithering mentions no species at all rare from this district, and\r\nPurton only three--_Melogramma Bulliardi_, _M. gastrinum_, and _Sphæria\r\npomiformis_. To these may be added _Nectria mammoidea_ and _Hypomyces\r\ncandicans_ from near Sutton; _Eutypa velutina_ and _E. scabrosa_\r\nfrom Berkswell; _Valsa cincta_ Fr., _V. aglæostoma_, and _Sphæria\r\nampullasca_, from Sutton; _Lophiostoma angustilabra_, from Middleton;\r\nand the interesting _Gymnoascus ruber_, which affords a glimpse of\r\nthe mode by which the Pyrenomycetes were evolved, has appeared in\r\nBirmingham itself.\r\n\r\nOf the Mucorini or Pin-mould family, to which belongs the pin-shaped\r\nmould, so common on decaying meat--two species of Pilobolus, _P.\r\nœdipus_ and _P. Kleinii_, remarkable for their extraordinary explosive\r\npower, have been found here and nowhere else in the kingdom. The\r\nsame is true of two species of Mortierella, _M. Candelabrum_ and _M.\r\npolycephala_, of which even the genus is not known from any other\r\nBritish locality.\r\n\r\nLastly we come to the Myxomycetes, a group which, though distinctly\r\nfungal, approximates in some degree to the animal kingdom. These\r\nare rather abundant here, nearly one third of the British Species\r\nhaving been found; including the rare _Didymium pertusum_; _Badhamia\r\nhyalina_; _Enerthenema papillatum_; _Dictydium umbilicatum_; _Cribraria\r\naurantiaca_; _Arcyria cinerea_, and _Prototrichia flagellifera_. Worthy\r\nof especial notice is _Physarum leucophæum_ Fr., hitherto only known\r\nas British by specimens published by Cooke in his “Fungi Britannici.”\r\nThe writer has found this at Sutton in abundance, and identifies it\r\nwith the heretofore unidentified _Trichia rubiformis_ of Purton, whose\r\ndescription is accompanied by an exceedingly accurate and picturesque\r\nplate (“Midland Flora,” tab. 37.)\r\n\r\nBesides the groups of Fungi enumerated above, there are others more\r\nobscure and consequently less interesting to many students, of which\r\nno mention will be made here, although numerous rare or undescribed\r\nspecies belonging to them have been found in the district within recent\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nARTICLES RECEIVED TOO LATE TO BE INCLUDED ALPHABETICALLY BETWEEN PAGES\r\n117 & 212.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chains, Cables, and Anchors.=--[BENJAMIN HINGLEY, M.P.]--(B. 99). The\r\nmanufacture of chains, cables, and anchors is carried on at Tipton,\r\nand to a much larger extent at Netherton, and in the neighbourhood\r\nof Old Hill near Dudley. The manufacture of chain cables in their\r\npresent form, namely, with elongated links supported by a bar or stud\r\nin the centre of each link is of comparatively modern origin; there\r\nare Naval men still living who remember that Men-of-War and Merchant\r\nShips were fitted with hempen cables of large diameter, which occupied\r\na considerable space in the fore-hold of the ship. The British Fleet in\r\nNelson’s fighting days knew not chain cables, but was encumbered with\r\nlarge coils of hempen rope.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that iron chains of some description were known and used\r\nin the days of the Romans, as it is recorded that Julius Cæsar could\r\nnot cut the cables of the vessels of the Gauls, because they were made\r\nof iron. Such chains were doubtless a succession of iron rings, or “S”\r\nhooks of comparatively small size. It is believed that the first chain\r\ncable was used on a British Ship, in the year 1808. It was made by a\r\nblacksmith named Robert Flinn, at North Shields, for a vessel which\r\nat that time was reckoned to be of a considerable size, namely, the\r\n“Ann and Isabella.” of 221 tons. It not only saved that vessel when in\r\nperil, but also saved a whole tier of ships that had been made fast to\r\nher, their hempen cables having been cut by the ice, owing to a great\r\nflood with much ice in the Tyne. This notable instance gave a great\r\nimpetus to the making of chain cables on the banks of the Tyne, where\r\nit is still carried on to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\nAt about the same date, Samuel Brown, afterwards Sir Samuel Brown, a\r\nLieutenant in the Royal Navy, having, it is said, been in communication\r\nwith Flinn, and taken a great interest in Flinn’s iron cables, took out\r\na patent, and in the year 1810 he prevailed upon the British Admiralty\r\nto put iron cables on several Men-of-War, with such successful results\r\nthat the days of hempen cables became numbered; Lieutenant Brown\r\nafterwards devoted his attention to the making of chain cables, and\r\nestablished a manufactory at Millwall on the Thames, he also, with the\r\nassistance of “John Rennie, an Engineer,” constructed an efficient\r\ntesting machine as he “was of opinion that there was nothing more\r\nessential in completing an iron cable than the most rigid attention to\r\nproving.”\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of chain cables naturally commenced on the sea coast,\r\nand it rapidly spread from the Tyne and Wear, where it first commenced,\r\nto London, Liverpool, Bristol, and to Aberdeen, and Irvine in Scotland.\r\nIt may be said, that up to the year 1820, although chain making was\r\na local industry in the district of Birmingham, it was confined to\r\nsmall welded chains in the form of elongated rings, for farming and\r\ndomestic purposes; but about the year 1820 a new impetus was given to\r\nit by the late Mr. Noah Hingley, who then carried on business as a\r\nnail master and dealer in small chains at Cradley Heath near Dudley.\r\nHe in the course of his business made periodical visits to the Port of\r\nLiverpool, travelling sometimes by the Stage Coach, and at other times\r\non horseback, and there, one of the new chain cables, with a stud in\r\nthe centre of each link, attracted his attention. He at once resolved\r\nto develop the trade in Staffordshire, and without hesitation made a\r\ncontract to supply to a Liverpool ship owner, a chain cable made of\r\niron 1½ inch diameter to be used in lieu of an hempen one. It was a\r\nbold venture, as no workman in the Midland district had ever seen a\r\nchain of such large size, or one fitted with studs, but after a few\r\ntrials a workman with the assistance of two strikers, and two boys to\r\nblow the bellows, succeeded in turning out a good chain cable which\r\nwas duly delivered in Liverpool, and did good service on board ship.\r\nThe making of this first chain cable was a source of wonder in the\r\ndistrict, and people came from far and wide to see it.\r\n\r\nMr. Hingley afterwards introduced the making of anchors in a similar\r\nmanner--bringing men from Liverpool with a knowledge of the trade, and\r\nafterwards erecting the first Nasmyth’s steam hammer for that purpose\r\nin the Staffordshire district, namely, at Netherton Ironworks, near\r\nDudley.\r\n\r\nMr. Hingley lived to see the chain cable and anchor trade developed\r\nto a large extent, and by several eminent firms who engaged in the\r\nbusiness in and about Dudley; he also took part in the establishment\r\nof efficient public testing machines at Netherton and at Tipton, under\r\nthe authority of an Act of Parliament, making compulsory the testing\r\nof cables and anchors for British ships. The machines in question are\r\nunder the control of the Board of Trade, and of Lloyd’s Registry of\r\nBritish and Foreign shipping, and are of the most powerful description.\r\nOne of the machines at Netherton is not only capable of testing, but\r\nalso of breaking for experimental purposes, a chain made of bar iron 4\r\ninches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of anchors and cables is now almost exclusively\r\nlocated in Staffordshire, having entirely left the sea coast except at\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne. The making of chain cables and anchors is for the\r\nmost part carried on in factories and exclusively by men and boys with\r\nthe aid of machinery, but the smaller chains for a variety of purposes,\r\nand especially trace chains, are made to a large extent by women and\r\ngirls in shops attached to the cottages. There are many hundreds,\r\nprobably a thousand or two, of the shops in question spread around the\r\ndistrict of Cradley Heath and Old Hill in the county of Stafford. It\r\ncannot be said that such work is unsuitable for women and girls within\r\ncertain limits; but there is no doubt that close inspection under the\r\nWorkshops Act is necessary, and that there should be strict limitations\r\nof the hours of labour. The tendency is not only to work children of\r\ntender years, but to do so until late at night, especially at the end\r\nof the week, to make up for lost time in the earlier part of the week.\r\nIt is computed that the Staffordshire chain and anchor trade as a whole\r\nconsumes annually about 50,000 to 70,000 tons of iron, according to the\r\nstate of trade, and the annual value, when trade is fair, approaches\r\none million sterling. The workpeople earn from five shillings per\r\nweek--the wages of a woman or girl--to fifty shillings per week, the\r\nwages of a large cable maker. It is a singular fact that anchor makers\r\nare to a considerable extent either Irish or of Irish origin, the\r\ndescendants of the original stock imported from Liverpool by the late\r\nMr. Noah Hingley. Their work is laborious and the wages continue high,\r\nvarying from thirty to sixty shillings per week, and for the most part\r\nthey spend it freely.\r\n\r\n=Die Sinking.=--[G. SHERRIFF TYE.]--(B. 560.) For brooches, buttons,\r\n&c., a block of iron is moulded by the forger on to which a piece\r\nof cast steel is welded. Medal dies are all steel, as the powerful\r\npressure applied would flatten them were they of iron. When a sharp\r\nblow is given, instead of pressure, the part-steel die stands the blow\r\nwell, though it will not withstand a squeeze. While the steel is soft\r\nthe die is cut out with steel cutting tools and finished by gravers,\r\nprevious to the final polishing. The die sinkers of Birmingham make\r\ndies for the following purposes, among others: buttons, military\r\nornaments, brassfoundry, plated wares, tea trays and tin work, gun work\r\nand small iron work, medals and coins, jewellery, seals for wax and\r\npaper embossing, brass dies for paper wrappers and bands, as used in\r\nthe wholesale linen trades; needles, papers, etc., wheels and rolls for\r\nornamenting metal tubes or sheets.\r\n\r\n=Saddlery Trade.=--[THOMAS MIDDLEMORE.]--(B. 463). _Obsolete Articles\r\nof Manufacture._--The articles supplied by the Saddlery trades being\r\nfor use rather than for ornament, it follows that fashion can have\r\nlittle effect in making any of them obsolete. Old wants have still to\r\nbe satisfied.\r\n\r\nIt is yet worth noticing that whilst a very large trade was done some\r\n30 years ago in shot belts, shot and cap pouches, and powder flasks,\r\nthis trade has now become practically obsolete, since the breechloader\r\nhas superseded the muzzleloader. Cartridges, both for military and\r\nsporting purposes, are now carried in a bag, or a bandolier, _i.e._, a\r\nshoulder or waist belt, to which is fastened transversely a series of\r\npockets, each of which holds a cartridge.\r\n\r\n_New varieties introduced._--For welts of saddles, “hide bellies”\r\nsplit very thin have for the most part taken the place of seal\r\nskins. Crocodile skins have been used occasionally for saddles with\r\nindifferent success, but for bags, purses and pocket books, they,\r\nalong with snake skins, have been largely and successfully employed.\r\nCalf skins for the latter purposes have been superseded by hides split\r\nspecially thin. Kangaroo skins are now used in the whip trade for\r\ncovering whips, but still more for making the whip thong. Hog skins,\r\nfor which formerly the sole use was the saddle manufacture, are now\r\nprepared for furniture purposes, bookbinding, and bags. They have the\r\nadvantages of being very durable, and of having a unique and handsome\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\n_Saddles_--The old “spring bar,” to which the stirrup leather is\r\nfastened, is gradually giving way to the “safety bar,” the object of\r\nwhich is to release the rider in the event of a fall, and to remove the\r\ndanger of his being dragged, which is an universally admitted fault\r\nof the old “spring bar.” Further, increased safety is secured to lady\r\nriders by various “safety stirrups” which render dragging by the foot\r\nimpossible. For the comfort of the horse the following inventions are\r\nworth notice:--“Gaussen’s corrugated rubber pannels” which break the\r\njar caused by the weight of the rider--“Inflated air pannels,” which\r\nhave the same effect--“ventilating pannels,” which are at the same time\r\nmovable; these last prevent the danger of sore backs, and are very\r\nreadily cleaned; they promise to become of general use.\r\n\r\n_Harness._--The changes that have here taken place concern rather the\r\nfurniture or metal work, than the general form. For cheaper kinds\r\nof harness, electro-plating has superseded close plating. Again,\r\nelectro-plating in its turn is being superseded by the new white\r\nmetals, which are alloys having the colour of silver, and of analogous\r\ncomposition to German silver. The advantages of the new metals are,\r\nthat they are uniform in their composition, and therefore durable,\r\ncheap, and of good appearance.\r\n\r\n_Military._--The regulation saddle of 20 years back, called the\r\n“Nolan,” has been superseded by an “Iron Arch Saddle,” and now\r\nanother regulation, introduced in 1884, made entirely of steel, with\r\nthe exception of the wooden side bars, is being used along with the\r\n“Iron Arch Saddle.” The old “knapsack” has given place to the new\r\n“Valise Equipment,” which was designed to distribute the weight of the\r\npack more evenly. On the introduction of the Camel Corps, a special\r\nequipment was designed. Large quantities of this pattern were used in\r\nthe Egyptian campaign.\r\n\r\n_Travelling Appointments._--The “Gladstone Bag,” a combination of a\r\nbag and portmanteau, has become more popular than any kind of either\r\nthe one or the other. Tin Boxes have quite replaced the old wooden\r\ntrunks. The quality has, however, of late years, been so reduced in\r\norder to force a sale, that unquestionably a reaction has set in\r\nagainst them. When damaged they are unsightly, and cannot be repaired.\r\nBaskets covered with canvas or leather are now, in consequence of their\r\ncheapness, lightness, and strength, much used for ladies’ travelling\r\ntrunks. The introduction of Bicycles and Tricycles has created a new\r\nand vast trade in saddles, satchels, and the like for wheelmen. The\r\ntrade is now only second in importance to that for ordinary English\r\nriding saddles.\r\n\r\n_Increase since 1865._--In the year 1864, the declared value of the\r\nexports of saddlery and harness for the United Kingdom was £345,419.\r\nFor the year 1885, the total value was only £385,687. This increase,\r\nof less than 12 per cent., compares unfavourably with that of the\r\nsixteen years from 1849 to 1865, which was more than 300 per cent. The\r\nexports for the first four months of the present year were £122,093,\r\nwhich is less than the exports for the same period in 1865 by £8,569.\r\nThis declining prosperity, which has occurred during the past five\r\nyears, is due to a strangled trade in South Africa, and droughts in\r\nAustralasia. Good seasons, and a rise in the wool market, give promise\r\nof an immediately better future for the saddlery trade.\r\n\r\n_Effects of the spread of Civilization on Supply of Raw Material._--The\r\nmost noteworthy fact in the leather trade, with regard to the spread\r\nof civilization upon its supply of material, is furnished by the\r\nbasils now sent in enormous quantities from the Australasian Colonies.\r\nBefore 1865, a sheep was grown simply for its fleece, and tallow. Of\r\nlate years the skin has been tanned, and converted into a basil. These\r\nColonial basils supply a demand which the home production has, of\r\nlate years, failed to satisfy. The Colonial basils are excellent in\r\ncolour and texture. If they were tanned in larch instead of the native\r\nmimosa bark, they could scarcely be further improved. The increase of\r\ncompetition has, during the past twenty years, led to the adulteration\r\nof leather. The adulterants most used are glucose and barytes. Such\r\nadulteration is now so general, that large consumers of leather are\r\ncompelled to avail themselves of the resources of chemical science, in\r\norder to learn the true value of the leather they buy, by ascertaining\r\nthe kind, and by estimating the quantity of the adulterant employed in\r\nthe leather tested.\r\n\r\n_New Processes introduced in Leather Dressing._--The old “Splitting”\r\nMachines have been improved, and a new kind called the “Band Knife”\r\nhas been introduced. Further Machines for “Scouring,” “Setting,” and\r\n“Rolling” leather have been invented, which do their work both better\r\nand cheaper than hand labour. The currier, as a rule, welcomes these\r\nmachines, since he is thereby relieved from much hard physical toil,\r\nwhilst his special skill has an unimpaired scope, and is just that part\r\nof his work that is best remunerated. Saddles--The sewing by Machine\r\nhas now become universal, and in point of quality is only just inferior\r\nto hand work. Harness--The “Lock Stitch” Machine has superseded the\r\n“Chain Stitch” Machine. The former sews with hard wax, such as is used\r\nin handwork. Generally for all cutting, where quantities are required,\r\nand when shaped pieces other than strips are wanted, the steam press\r\nhas superseded the hand knife.\r\n\r\n_Machinery or Hand Labour._--During the last 20 years all branches of\r\nthe saddlery trades have benefited by the steadily increased employment\r\nof machinery--this is most marked in the currying of leather.\r\n\r\n_Effects of Improved modes of Manufacture on Cost of Production._--The\r\narticles of the saddlery trade combine so many different kinds of\r\nmaterial and include such a variety of labour, that no estimate could\r\nbe relied upon of the reduction of cost due to improved methods of\r\nmanufacture. The values of articles generally reckoned in money are\r\nabout 10 per cent. below the values of 1865.\r\n\r\n_Present Extent and Description of Manufacture._--In regard to the\r\nHome trade it is only needful to say that owing to the agricultural\r\ndepression of the past 10 years, the demand for saddlery has very\r\ngreatly fallen off. To some extent this falling off in bulk is supplied\r\nby the demands of cycle riders. In the Foreign trade the past 20\r\nyears have witnessed a vast development of the demand from the South\r\nAfrican Colonies. This, owing to a series of seasons of drought, to the\r\ncommercial panic of the diamond fields, and to the unsettled political\r\nstate of the Colonies, has been followed by an unparalleled state of\r\ndepression, which has made the export saddlery trade one of the most\r\ndisastrously depressed of our industries. Indeed, it has been remarked\r\nby one thoroughly conversant with the trade, that, if the present state\r\nof things continue, Walsall, which solely depends on the saddlery and\r\nleather trades, will, before long, wear the same look as Bruges, with\r\ngrass growing in its streets.\r\n\r\n_Effects of Foreign Tariffs._--The effect of the continued high duties\r\nin the United States has been to practically kill the English trade\r\nboth in saddlery and saddlers’ ironmongery. Since the Franco-German\r\nwar, the French tariff has been increased. This seems to have had\r\nlittle effect on the saddlery trade between England and France.\r\nUnquestionably, however, France is now losing markets where formerly\r\nher goods were preferred to those of this country.\r\n\r\n_Where else Manufacture carried on._--Since 1865, Glasgow has ceased to\r\nbe an important centre of the saddlery trade. It is now chiefly carried\r\non in Birmingham and Walsall, for export saddlery. In military goods,\r\nBermondsey competes with Birmingham and Walsall.\r\n\r\n_Approximate Number of Persons employed in this Town and\r\nDistrict._--_Men, Women, Boys, and Girls._--No satisfactory statement\r\ncan now be made, as the present time is one of exceptional depression.\r\n\r\n_Average Earnings._--Speaking generally there has been a reduction in\r\nmoney wages of about 10 per cent. This wage reckoned in commodities, of\r\ncourse, represents a substantial improvement, as compared with 1865. In\r\ngood times the workman was never so well remunerated, and, on the other\r\nhand, his employer so poorly rewarded.\r\n\r\n_Social Condition of Workpeople._--No remark need be made in regard to\r\nthe improvement of his social condition which the saddler has shared\r\nwith those of other trades. The Factory Acts have practically ended the\r\nemployment of children. The trade hardly knows the “half-timer.” The\r\nnew Patents Act has proved a great stimulus to the invention of the\r\nworkman.\r\n\r\n_Utilisation of Waste._--If the past 5 years have been disastrous\r\nfor the saddlery trade, misfortune has yet taught its lessons. Chief\r\namongst these are an economical use of material, and the utilisation\r\nof waste. The belly and shoulder parts of hides, which used often to\r\nbe sent to market, are now mostly consumed, thus saving capital and\r\nenabling a cheaper article to be produced. Again, the scrap leather,\r\nwhich is necessarily created by even the most careful cutting, is\r\nnow utilised in making goods of extraordinary cheapness. A splitting\r\nmachine for dividing pieces of leather, however small, into any\r\nrequired number of thicknesses, is of great help to this end. When\r\nleather is reduced in size below what is required for any article of\r\ncommerce, it is then used either for hardening purposes, or to form\r\nimitation leather when reduced to a pulp and rolled either by itself or\r\nwith rope fibre.\r\n\r\n=Chemicals.=--In obtaining the statistical information on p. 152, I\r\nam indebted in great measure to Dr. Bostock Hill, Secretary of the\r\nBirmingham Section of the Society of Chemical Industry.--C. J. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO GEOLOGY AND PHYSIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nPART III., PAGES 213 TO 265.\r\n\r\nMINERALS. (OF THE BIRMINGHAM DISTRICT.)\r\n\r\nBY C. J. WOODWARD, B.SC., F.G.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crystalline minerals occurring within the limits of the Birmingham\r\ndistrict may be most conveniently referred to under the titles of\r\nthe several counties in which they actually occur. These counties\r\nare: Derbyshire, Gloucestershire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire,\r\nNottinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire,\r\nand Worcestershire.\r\n\r\n=Derbyshire.=--The mines in this county are worked out, and there is\r\nbut little opportunity of meeting with minerals. On the spoil-banks of\r\nthe old mines poor specimens may be found. Mr. John Tym, of Castleton,\r\nis a local dealer, and the guide to the High Tor Grotto has minerals\r\nfor sale. The following list with localities is taken from a paper\r\non “Economic Geology of Derbyshire,” by Mr. A. H. Stokes, F.G.S.,\r\nH.M. Inspector of Mines. _Barytes_, nearly all lead mines, Newhaven;\r\n_Blende_, Old hillocks, near Ashover and Hartington; _Gypsum_,\r\nChellaston, also railway cutting between Trent and Loughborough;\r\n_Brown Hæmatite_, north west of Hubberdale mine, near Taddington, also\r\nnear Elton; _Brown Lead Ore “Linnets,”_ Elton, and Newhaven, Winster;\r\n_Calcite_, colourless at lead mines of Nether Haddon, near Bakewell.\r\nAlpart, Ashover, and Wirksworth yield good specimens. _Elaterite_,\r\nWindy Knoll Quarry, Main Tor, Castleton; _Fluor Spar_, Blue John\r\nand other mines, Castleton; _Limonite_, a field, one mile north of\r\nCastleton, and to the east of Odin Lead mine; _Petroleum_, Riddings\r\nColliery, near Alfreton. A sump is sunk at the bottom of the mine,\r\nand into this the oil finds its way. Some years as much as 100 tons\r\nof oil have been obtained at a price as high as £7. 10s. per ton.\r\n_Phosgenite_, very scarce, Meer Brook Sough mine, near Worksworth;\r\n_Pyrites_, large cubic crystals at Gregory mine, near Ashover; _Rock\r\ncrystal_, Buxton, in amygdaloid cavities of toad stone; also Diamond\r\nHill, near Miller’s Dale station; _Towanite_, Old hillocks at Ecton\r\nmine, Cumberland mine, Matlock Bath; _Wad_, mines near Elton; _White\r\nLead Ore_ (_Cerussite_), near Brassington; Heyspots mine, near Elton;\r\nCabin mine, Newhaven. A more extensive list of the minerals of\r\nDerbyshire, compiled by the Rev. J. M. Mello, will be found in “The\r\nMidland Naturalist,” Vol. iv., p. 183.\r\n\r\n=Gloucestershire.=--Mr. H.B. Woodward, of the Geological Survey, has\r\ngiven the following list:--_Agate_, Berkeley, Damory Bridge; _Barytes_,\r\nTortworth; _Bitumen_, Clifton; _Brown Spar_, Tortworth; _Celestine_,\r\nTortworth, Thornbury, Wickwar, Aust; _Fluor Spar_, Clifton; _Göthite_,\r\nClifton; _Jasper_, Tortworth; _Prehnite_, Woodford Bridge, Berkeley;\r\n_Rock Salt (pseudomorphs)_, Aust; _Steatite_, Tortworth; _Talc_,\r\nTortworth; _Vivianite_, near Clifton.\r\n\r\nPyle Hill, near Clifton, is a well-known locality for Celestine. At\r\nGarden Cliff, near Westbury-on-Severn, the “bone bed” is well exposed,\r\nand in this bed occurs plenty of iron pyrites; and in the shales, as\r\nmight be expected, crystals of selenite occur.\r\n\r\n=Leicestershire.=--_Gold_ occurs in the quartz veins round Pedlar Tor,\r\nCharnwood Forest. _Garnets_ occur in “gneiss” at Brazil Wood (Mr. W. J.\r\nHarrison). _Copper pyrites_, _Molybdenum_, Mount Sorrel and Breedon.\r\n_Galena_, _Blende_, Dimminsdale; _Dolomite_, Cloud Hill; _Gypsum_ and\r\n_Selenite_, various places; _Iron pyrites_ in cubes, Swithland Great\r\nPit (Mr. James Plant).\r\n\r\n=Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire.=--_Barytes_, _Blende_, _Calcite_,\r\n_Galena_, _Glauconite_, _Gypsum_ (_Selenite_), _Lignite_, _Limonite_,\r\n_Pyrites_, _Websterite_, occur in the neighbourhood of Banbury (Mr.\r\nThomas Beesley).\r\n\r\n=Nottinghamshire.=--_Gypsum_ occurs in veins near Retford, and is used\r\nfor garden rock-work.\r\n\r\n=Shropshire.=--At Lilleshall an old mine known as the Stump Leasow,\r\nworked for limestone, yielded the following minerals:[67]--_Quartz_, a\r\nminute crystal only. _Erubescite_, a few minute patches in the massive\r\nform. _Copper Pyrites_, in sphenoids. _Iron Pyrites_, in radiating\r\nmasses. _Hæmatite_, in minute chocolate-coloured hemispherical masses,\r\nalso in an almost continual film containing the calc spar and other\r\nminerals with a coppery sheen. _Barytes_, in pink, lamellar, somewhat\r\nradiating masses. At the free surfaces of these masses are transparent\r\ncrystals. _Calcite_, in beautiful ice-like clusters of crystals taking\r\nthe form of steep three-faced pyramids. The groups are made up of\r\nsteep scalenohedrous with rhombohedral summits. The calcite is in some\r\ncases pink due to manganese, a sample contained 1·20 per cent. of MnO.\r\nIn the lower measures the calcite occurs in pointed scalenohedrous\r\nlining cavities in the stone. _Dolomite_, is the most interesting\r\nmineral of the group. It occurs in nodules made up of a succession of\r\nlaminæ of varying diameters, the laminæ crystallizing at the edges in\r\nrhombs resembling pearl spar. The composition of one sample of this\r\ndolomite is nearly identical with what according to Boricky is one of\r\nthe possible values of Ankerite. Another approximates to the formula\r\n3 CaCO₃ + (FeMn) CO₃ + MgCO₃ and should be described as a ferriferous\r\ndolomite.\r\n\r\nIn the mining district of West Shropshire many beautiful and\r\ninteresting minerals are met with. The district is best reached\r\nfrom Birmingham by taking train to Minsterley, via Shrewsbury. At\r\nSnailbeach Mine, near Minsterley, occur beautiful rhombs of _Calcite_,\r\nhaving a violet tinge, due to a small quantity of manganese. There\r\nare also crystals of _Blende_ and _Galena_. At several of the mines\r\n_Witherite_ and _Barytes_ are found, and, according to Mr. Morton,\r\nother minerals met with are _Quartz_, _Chalcedony_, _Petroleum_,\r\n_Pyrites_, _Malachite_, _Redruthite_, _Wad_, _Minium_, and _Cerussite_.\r\nAt Wotherton, two miles from Chirbury, is a fine barytes lode which\r\nhas been worked for more than 60 years, at first as an open mine, and\r\nsubsequently by means of a shaft. The barytes is remarkably pure, and\r\nafter grinding is sold in large quantities. In the lode are crevices\r\nand cavities filled with a fine mud, and penetrating into the mud are\r\nfine transparent crystals. These crystals have been measured by Mr.\r\nMiers, of the British Museum, and a record of the forms present will be\r\nfound in his description.[68] (“Nature,” vol. xxix., p. 29.)\r\n\r\nIn connection with the mineralogy of Shropshire, it should be recorded\r\nthat the extremely rare instance of the fall of an iron meteorite in\r\nthe British Isles took place in this county at Rowton, near Wellington,\r\non April 20th, 1876. This meteorite was extracted by Mr. G. Brooks,\r\nfrom the hole in which it had buried itself, and was hot when removed.\r\nIt is now in the possession of the British Museum, and Prof. Maskelyne\r\nhas given particulars of it in “Nature,” vol. xiv., p. 472. It weighs 7\r\nlbs. 11 oz., “is a mass of metallic iron irregularly angular, although\r\nall its edges appear to have been rounded by fusion in its transit\r\nthrough the air, and, except at the point where it first struck the\r\nground, it is covered by a thin black pellicle of the magnetic oxide of\r\niron … the exposed metallic part of the surface exhibits crystalline\r\nstructure very clearly when it is etched. It is only the seventh\r\naërosiderite or meteoric iron of which the fall has been witnessed,\r\nalthough upwards of a hundred iron masses have been discovered in\r\ndifferent parts of the globe, which are undoubtedly meteoric, and two\r\nsuch have been found in Great Britain.”[69]\r\n\r\n=Warwickshire.=--Many years ago a pocket of _Grey Oxide of Manganese_\r\nwas found near Atherstone, but I have been unable to find now any\r\ntraces of it. _Gypsum_ occurs in the cutting of a disused railway\r\nnear Henley-in-Arden, and at Spernall (Spernall Plaster Pits), near\r\nAlcester. Mr. A. H. Atkins has called attention to the fact that gypsum\r\nwas met with in sinking an artesian well in Small Heath Park, near\r\nBirmingham; he also mentions the occurrence of _Green Copper Carbonate_\r\nat Vaughton’s Hole, near Birmingham.\r\n\r\n=Worcestershire.=--Dr. Harvey B. Holl mentions the following\r\nminerals as occurring at the Malvern Hills:--_Quartz_, _Orthoclase_,\r\n_Labradorite_, _Anderine_, _Potash Mica_, _Ferruginous Mica_\r\n(_Biolite_), _Augite_, _Hornblende_, _Epidote_, _Chlorite_, _Hæmatite_,\r\n_Calc Spar_, _Graphite_, _Zeolites_, and _Garnet_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[The following articles refer to subjects which could not be included\r\nin previous papers, and which are yet worth notice as part of the\r\nhistory of Birmingham.--ED.]\r\n\r\n=Botanical Gardens.=--[SAM: TIMMINS.]--The first proposal to establish\r\nBotanical Gardens, in accordance with the science of horticulture\r\nof the time, was made in 1829. Twelve acres were secured in the\r\nthen rural suburb of Edgbaston, and on the advice of the famous J.\r\nC. Loudon four more acres were added, and the buildings erected by\r\nClarke of Birmingham, and opened to the public in 1831. The original\r\ncapital was 500 shares of £5 each, and an annual payment of three\r\nguineas which secured certain privileges of admission beyond those\r\nof the subscriber’s payment. The institution flourished, with some\r\nvicissitudes, for many years, but was necessarily exclusive, and only\r\nrecently have admissions been made more easy by reduced and varying\r\ncharges on different days. On Monday--the people’s day--large numbers\r\nattend, and the experiment has proved successful. The buildings were\r\nrecently greatly extended and rearranged from the designs of Mr. Frank\r\nOsborne, and are now believed to be amongst the best of the kingdom.\r\nFlower shows are held during the summer, and prizes awarded, which are\r\neagerly contended for by numerous horticulturists and florists of the\r\ntown and neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n=Guinea Gardens.=--[SAM: TIMMINS.]--Near the Botanical Gardens a group\r\nof small gardens may be seen, which are the only “survivals” of the\r\nacres of “allotment gardens” or “guinea gardens,” which surrounded\r\nBirmingham within a mile from the centre as late as 1830 to 1840.\r\nBirmingham was, in fact, a town of gardens fifty years ago, not merely\r\nas to the gardens attached to houses--front and back gardens in the\r\nprincipal parts of the town,--but of the groups of gardens rented by\r\nworkmen and others, who could reach their gardens easily from their\r\nhomes by a short walk, and devote mornings and evenings to them.\r\nThe sites of the Kent Street Baths, and those opposite St. Thomas’s\r\nChurch,--at Ladywood, Spring Hill, Hockley, Handsworth, and Aston\r\nroad,--all within the Parish Boundary, formed a belt of gardens where\r\nthe workman and his family often spent the summer evenings and enjoyed\r\nthe (then) country air. All is now changed, and the distances even by\r\nrail and tram are too great, and land too valuable, to be let out in\r\nreadily accessible gardens for the workers of the town, who cannot for\r\nmany reasons live in the suburbs which railways have opened since 1840.\r\n\r\n=Sunday Lecture Society.=--[THOS. ROSE.]--This Society, which has now\r\nbecome one of the most successful of our local institutions, had a very\r\nhumble origin. In 1877, a few members of the Birmingham Temperance\r\nSociety (foremost amongst whom was Mr. Thos. Hewins), conceived the\r\nidea of holding Meetings on Sunday evenings “for the social, moral, and\r\nintellectual improvement of the non-church and chapel-going portion of\r\nthe community.” They accordingly formed themselves into a Committee,\r\nwho engaged the then newly erected Board Schools in Bristol Street,\r\nfor the winter season of 1877-8, and commenced what were described\r\nas “Sunday Evening Meetings for the People.” For a short time these\r\nmeetings were of a purely temperance character, but finding that they\r\nwere not so thoroughly appreciated as they had expected, the Committee\r\nextended the variety of the subjects, and lectures were delivered\r\nembracing a wide range of thought, both moral and religious, literary\r\nand dramatic, scientific and historical, occasionally interspersed with\r\nmusical evenings illustrative of the principal oratorios. Foremost\r\namongst the lecturers (who numbered many of our chief local literary\r\nand scientific men), was Mr. Sam: Timmins, who from the first took\r\nan active part in the movement, the success of which was from this\r\ntime assured, the lectures being attended by crowded and appreciative\r\naudiences every Sunday evening, and occasionally hundreds were unable\r\nto obtain admission.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, the then Mayor (Alderman R. Chamberlain), generously offered\r\nthe Committee the free use of the Town Hall, and for some months the\r\nlectures were delivered consecutively in that place to audiences\r\nnumbering from 3 to 4,000 each Sunday. This gave rise to considerable\r\nopposition on the part of the various religious sects of the town\r\nagainst what was considered to be “a monopoly of the use of the hall by\r\none particular sect,” and after much controversy in the public press,\r\nand debate in the Town Council, the question of the letting of the Town\r\nHall on Sundays was left in the hands of the Mayor for the time being,\r\non the understanding that its continuous use by any one sect should\r\nbe refused. Thereupon the lectures were resumed in the Bristol Street\r\nBoard School, with occasional special lectures in the Town Hall.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, the movement assumed a more representative character. The\r\nthen Hon. Sec. (Mr. T. Rose), assisted by some of the leading members\r\nof the Committee, took steps to organize a Sunday Lecture Society,\r\nand a Meeting was held on July 1st, 1881, under the Presidency of\r\nMr. William Harris, J.P., when the present Society was publicly\r\ninaugurated, the objects being--“To provide for the delivery on Sundays\r\nin the Borough of Birmingham, and to encourage the delivery elsewhere\r\nof lectures upon subjects calculated to promote the social, moral,\r\nand intellectual well-being of the community at large, as hitherto\r\nconducted by the Committee of the Sunday Evening Meetings for the\r\nPeople.”\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the Society also provided that a minimum\r\nsubscription of One Shilling per year should constitute membership,\r\nand that any pecuniary profit should be applied to the further\r\npromotion of the objects of the Society. Mr. Sam: Timmins was elected\r\nfirst President, and the management of its affairs was entrusted to a\r\nCommittee of 30, exclusive of Officers, to be elected annually from\r\namongst the body of members.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of the Society’s existence the members numbered\r\n80, including the names of many of the most influential public men\r\nof the town, and the subscription list amounted to £45. 14s. 6d. The\r\nnumber of members is now 168, and the subscription list amounts to £70;\r\nthe income being further augmented by the collections taken at the\r\nvarious lectures (which are thus largely self-supporting). Nearly all\r\nthe lectures being given voluntarily, the cost of working the Society\r\nis comparatively small, and is fully met by the income derived from\r\nsubscriptions and collections. Five of the principal Board Schools are\r\nengaged every Sunday evening throughout the winter season, from October\r\nto April, and at intervals special lectures are delivered in the Town\r\nHall. During the season from 1885 to 1886, 71 lectures were delivered\r\nat the Board Schools, with a total attendance of 23,150, or an average\r\nof 326 to each lecture, and 10 lectures were delivered at the Town\r\nHall, with a total attendance of 33,000, or an average of 3,300 for\r\neach lecture. Ald. R. Chamberlain, M.P., is now President of the\r\nSociety, as well as one of its most popular lecturers. In Councillor\r\nR. F. Martineau, the Committee possesses a most able and energetic\r\nChairman. Mr. W. B. Smith is the Treasurer, and Mr. J. H. Forrester,\r\nNo. 1, Summer Hill Terrace, worthily fills the office of Hon. Secretary.\r\n\r\n=Newspapers.=--[SAM: TIMMINS.]--The earliest known Birmingham Newspaper\r\nwas “The Birmingham Journal,” published by Thomas Warren, in 1733.\r\nIt was at first published on Thursdays, but afterwards on Mondays.\r\nOnly one copy has survived, that of May 21st, 1733, No. XXVIII. The\r\n“Journal” is interesting as it shows some traces of the style of Dr.\r\nJohnson, who very probably assisted Warren in his newspaper. “Aris’s\r\nBirmingham Gazette” was first published in 1741, and its original title\r\nis used on the Saturday issue from the Daily Gazette Office to this\r\nday. It was originally published on Mondays, and some of its earlier\r\nissues bore another heading, for special County circulation. “Swinney’s\r\nBirmingham Chronicle” was published for several years, from 1796 to\r\n1816, but no complete file has been preserved. Jabet’s “Commercial\r\nHerald” was issued from 1804 to 1813. The “Birmingham Journal” was\r\nrevived in 1825, by Wm. Hodgetts, and was continued until absorbed in\r\n“The Daily Post.” The “Birmingham Advertiser” was commenced in 1833,\r\nand continued till 1845. In 1836, the “Midland Counties Herald” was\r\nbegun on a new plan of gratuitous circulation and is continued as a\r\nsheet of advertisements and news relating to the land and agricultural\r\ninterests to this day. The “Birmingham Morning News” appeared in 1871,\r\nwith George Dawson as its first editor, and was continued till 1875.\r\n\r\n“Aris’s Birmingham Gazette” was one of the first two country papers\r\nwhich began a series of “Local Notes and Queries” in 1856. The example\r\nhas been very generally followed, and the series continued in the\r\n“Weekly Post” and the “Weekly Mercury,” and many important facts of\r\nlocal history have thus been discovered and preserved.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the “taxes on knowledge”--the stamp duty and\r\nadvertisement duty and the paper duty--soon produced local daily\r\npapers, the first being the “Daily Press,” in 1855, edited for some\r\ntime by George Dawson, and followed by the “Daily Mercury.” In 1857\r\nthe “Daily Post” was started, and in 1879 the “Daily Globe” appeared.\r\nIn 1869 the “Midland Illustrated News” was begun, but it survived\r\nonly about a year and a half. Among the other newspapers were the\r\n“Birmingham Chronicle” (1823); the “Midland Chronicle” (1811); the\r\n“Philanthropist” (1835). Many other short-lived newspapers have been\r\nissued from time to time--many of which are to some extent preserved by\r\nodd copies in the Reference Library, and among them a German newspaper\r\nof which only one number appeared. Birmingham was one of the first\r\ntowns which produced a Sunday newspaper--the “Sunday Echo,” and some\r\nothers have been issued since. The “cheap press” secured a very large\r\nnumber of readers, when the first halfpenny daily evening paper, the\r\n“Daily Mail,” was established in 1869, followed for some time by a\r\nsimilar issue from the “Daily Gazette” office, and afterwards by the\r\n“Midland Echo.”\r\n\r\nMany monthly pamphlets--practically newspapers--were issued, such as\r\nthe “Independent” (1827), and “Inspector” (1817); the “Weekly Recorder”\r\nand “Register” (1819), by George Edmonds; and many serials, sarcastic\r\nor humorous, have appeared from time to time. The scurrilous “Argus” of\r\nfifty years ago, and later the “Town Crier” (1861), “Brum,” “Graphic,”\r\n“Dart,” “Owl,” “Free Lance,” &c., with our illustrated “Phonographic\r\nPunch,” and one local monthly, “Edgbastonia,” in which many interesting\r\nbiographies of local celebrities have appeared. On several occasions\r\nSunday sermons have been published in serials such as the “Birmingham\r\nPulpit” (1871-73). Other attempts to establish newspapers for\r\ndiscussion rather than mere news have been tried as in the “Liberal\r\nReview” (1880).\r\n\r\n=Theatres.=--[SAM: TIMMINS.]--Birmingham has been famous as a\r\ntheatrical town for nearly a century, and especially as the “training\r\nground” where many of the leading actors of the present century learned\r\ntheir art and won their first laurels. The stage was, however, rather\r\na late creation in Birmingham, and no traces are found earlier than\r\nabout 1730, when mere booths served the purpose of a “play-house,”\r\nand actors were only “rogues and vagabonds” according to law. “A shed\r\nin Temple Street” and a “stable in Castle Street,” with admission\r\nthreepence each, and the small band parading the town during the day,\r\nin the absence of newspapers, to announce the performance, formed,\r\naccording to Hutton, the “rise of the drama” in our town. As early as\r\n1750 travelling circuses and theatres appeared in Coleshill Street;\r\nand in 1802 the famous Astley brought his circus to the “back of\r\nthe Stork Hotel.” In 1730 a temporary building was erected in Moor\r\nStreet, in 1743 another in New Street, in 1747 another in Smallbrook\r\nStreet, and in 1776 a more important and permanent theatre was built\r\nin King Street--a street covered by the railway station and Stephenson\r\nPlace, and the site of the theatre being now that of the front of the\r\nExchange. This became an important theatre, and existed till late in\r\nthe century in competition with the present Theatre Royal, which was\r\nfounded about the same date. The few play bills which have survived,\r\nand the expenditure on the building, show that every effort was made\r\nto do justice to the drama a century ago. At this date theatres were\r\nmerely tolerated, but in 1777 an application was made for a licence\r\nfor the New Street Theatre to play for “four months in the year,” and\r\nthis application was somewhat famous, for it was eloquently supported\r\nby Edmund Burke, who used the phrase--since so well-known and so little\r\nunderstood--that Birmingham was the “great Toy-shop of Europe.” The\r\nphrase, however, was not new, but was used in a book by Sir Samuel\r\nMorland a hundred years earlier to describe the shops where trinkets\r\nand small steel and iron wares were sold, and not in connection\r\nwith children’s “toys.” The second reading of the Bill, to enable\r\nHis Majesty the King to grant a Patent was, however, lost, but the\r\nenterprise was continued, and in 1780 the present front of the Theatre\r\nRoyal was erected with a commodious theatre, well lighted by wax\r\ncandles, and with “the passages warmed with stoves” as the performances\r\nwere to be given in the winter as well as the summer months. It was\r\nnot till 1807 that a “Patent” was secured for the Theatre which then\r\nbecame the Theatre Royal, and still remains under the jurisdiction\r\nof the Lord Chamberlain. In 1778 a “wooden building” was erected as\r\nan “opera house,” near the Plough and Harrow, in the Moseley Road,\r\nbut this was burned down soon after. In 1792, the Theatre Royal was\r\ndestroyed by fire, and again in 1820, but the front remained unharmed\r\nin these two great fires and the medallions of Shakespeare and Garrick\r\nremain as placed in 1780. In both cases the fires were believed to be\r\nincendiary and with good reason too. In 1795 the Theatre was rebuilt\r\nand re-opened by William Macready, who remained till 1810, in which\r\nyear, on June 11, his future famous son, William Charles Macready,\r\nappeared as Romeo,--“a young gentleman and his first appearance on any\r\nstage.” In 1813, Macready was followed by Elliston, as lessee, and in\r\n1819 he was succeeded by Alfred Bunn. During all this period all the\r\ngreat actresses, and actors, and singers, and celebrities of the time\r\nappeared on the Theatre Royal stage, and a very complete series of\r\nPlay Bills has fortunately been preserved. The present lessee, Mr. M.\r\nH. Simpson, and his father have had the Theatre Royal for fifty years,\r\nand recently additions and alterations have been made, not only in\r\nthe Theatre proper, but in the accessory rooms for actors and scenery\r\nwhich have never been surpassed for extent and convenience. The Theatre\r\nRoyal was, practically, the only theatre for many years, but in 1853 a\r\ndramatic licence was granted by the magistrates for a building on the\r\nBingley Hall site: in 1856 the “Music Hall” in Broad Street was built,\r\nbut in 1862 it was converted into a theatre, and opened as the Royal\r\nOperetta House, by Mr. W. H. Swanborough. In 1866 it was bought by Mr.\r\nJames Rodgers, and in 1876 was practically rebuilt, and additions and\r\nalterations are now in progress under Mr. Rodgers and his Son. In 1879\r\na license was granted to the Holte Theatre, in the Aston Lower Grounds;\r\nand the Grand Theatre, Corporation Street, built and managed by Mr.\r\nAndrew Melville, was opened November 14, 1883. In 1785 an Amphitheatre\r\nexisted in Livery Street and was converted into a Chapel: in King\r\nStreet the Theatre was also converted into a Chapel, and afterwards\r\nback again to a Public Hall; and in 1827 the Circus of James Ryan,\r\npermanently built some years later, was converted into the Circus\r\nChapel. In short, the great progress of Birmingham in the second half\r\nof the last century was felt in every way: the Musical Festival was\r\nfounded, and the drama grew rapidly as the town extended and the taste\r\nof the public improved.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COVENTRY INDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nBY W. G. FRETTON, F.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn exhaustive account of the ribbon and watch manufactures of Coventry,\r\nwith technical descriptions of the various processes involved in the\r\ntreatment of the raw material, in its progress of manufacture from its\r\nprimitive condition to its finished state, having already appeared\r\nin the comprehensive series of articles in the midland industries,\r\npublished on the occasion of the former visit of the Association in\r\n1865, it only remains to note the changes and additions which have been\r\nmade since that period in the Industries of Coventry.\r\n\r\n=Ribbon Trade.=--Several causes have combined to produce a very\r\nserious decline in the manufacture of silk fabrics, the chief of them\r\nbeing the French commercial treaty, to which may be added change of\r\nfashion, and increased competition and more rapid production by the\r\nfurther development of machinery. From 1860 to 1878 the ribbon trade\r\nin Coventry and its neighbourhood, had decreased by at least one half,\r\nand the decline has been going on since that period, with exceptional\r\nexperiences of spasmodic improvement, ever since. Efforts have been\r\nmade in various ways to direct the textile skill of the artisans into\r\nother channels wherein their weaving abilities might be turned to\r\ntheir advantage, and the area of textile manufactures increased. In\r\none of these departments may be specially noticed the manufacture of\r\n_bookmarks_, and other illuminated ribbons. This trade was chiefly\r\nintroduced by Mr. Thomas Stevens, and has been most successfully\r\ndeveloped by himself and other manufacturers, until their extent,\r\nbeauty of design, variety of application, &c., have been marvellous.\r\nPortraits, valentines, presents suitable to the seasons, birthdays,\r\nviews of noted buildings, poetical sentences, mottoes, labels, and\r\nother decorative and descriptive ornaments have been produced, which,\r\nhalf a century ago, it would have been deemed impossible to produce\r\nfrom a loom. But this has involved the construction of complicated\r\nand expensive machinery, and has raised the art of loom-making\r\nconsiderably. Such a trade is, after all, but limited, it is the\r\nproduction of a luxury, a merchandise “which none but the rich can buy.”\r\n\r\n=Trimming Trade.=--Another department of textile industry which has\r\nsprung up, somewhat analogous to the Ribbon manufacture, is the\r\nTrimming trade, for which special looms have been adopted--cambric\r\nfrilling, mainly introduced by Messrs. Cash; bead work, and other\r\nornamental fabrics have also been introduced.\r\n\r\n=Cotton Spinning and Weaving.=--Soon after the decline of the ribbon\r\ntrade the attention of the Coventry manufacturers was drawn to the\r\nexperiment of introducing the cotton spinning and weaving. A large\r\nfactory with suitable annexes for carrying on a large trade was erected\r\non the north side of the city by a company formed in 1860, the Rev. S.\r\nH. Widdrington, then vicar of St. Michael’s, taking a great interest\r\nin the project. Its operations have been attended by varied success;\r\nthe distance from the centres of the cotton trade forming an obstacle\r\nto its full development, the spinning department has received most\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n=Elastic Web.=--In 1859 Messrs. Dalton and Barton introduced the\r\nmanufacture of elastic webs, but afterwards disposed of this department\r\nof their business to Mr. Pridmore, by whom it is still carried on\r\nat Foleshill. In 1862 a company was formed for carrying on the same\r\nkind of trade, chiefly through the instrumentality of the vicar of\r\nSt. Michael’s, and known as the Coventry Elastic Weaving Company,\r\nand for nearly twenty years it conducted a large business, having\r\nbranches at Red Lane, Foleshill, and in White Friars’ Lane, Coventry.\r\nOwing to a brisk competition in other weaving centres, and consequent\r\nover-production, the company dissolved a few years ago, a portion of\r\nthe plant and trade being retained by Mr. J. C. Odell, one of the\r\nmembers of the company, and still successfully carried on. There are\r\nseveral firms in the city conducting similar business.\r\n\r\n=The Bradford Stuff Manufacture= was introduced into Coventry in\r\n1864, and established in a large disused factory, originally erected\r\nas a cotton mill, in Hill Street, afterwards occupied as a ribbon\r\nmanufactory. The firm is known as the “Leigh” Mills Company (Limited),\r\nthe present Lord-Lieutenant of the County having shown much interest in\r\nthe promotion of this and other new industries in Coventry. Excellent\r\nwoollen and worsted goods are made here, silk and cotton being also\r\nused in some of the varieties manufactured.\r\n\r\n=Coach Lace and Broad Stuffs= for railway and other carriages,\r\ntrimmings for furniture, &c., are largely manufactured by Messrs.\r\nDalton and Barton, Messrs. Perkins and Son, and others.\r\n\r\n=Silk Dyeing= is still carried on to a considerable extent by several\r\nfirms, and the city maintains its old character for the permanence and\r\nbrilliancy exhibited in this class of work, which is one of the ancient\r\nstaples of the city.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that while Coventry still maintains its textile\r\nproductions in the weaving industry, its works are not confined\r\nto ribbons, and the manufacturers and artisans generally deserve\r\nthe highest commendation for the spirit and the aptitude they have\r\ndisplayed in adapting themselves to the altered circumstances of the\r\ntextile industry of the city, and the opening up of new branches of the\r\nweaving industry has emancipated the city from dependence on the ribbon\r\ntrade alone.\r\n\r\nMany firms are still engaged in the manufacture of ribbons, sashes,\r\nladies’ scarfs, &c., and during the last year or two, gauzes having\r\nbeen in demand have been largely made.\r\n\r\n=Watch Manufacturing.=--Coventry is one of the principal places in\r\nEngland for this branch of manufacturing industry, and at the head of\r\nthe numerous firms engaged therein, Messrs. J. Rotherham and Sons hold\r\nthe first and oldest position. A trade of such extent, and exhibiting\r\nso many stages of progress in its production, necessarily possesses\r\nmany features of interest, and may be divided into the following,\r\nwith minor divisions springing from them:--watch manufacturers, case\r\nmakers, engravers, springers, engine-turners, and polishers; cap\r\nmakers, dial makers, escapement, balance, pallet, roller, and lever\r\nmakers; movement, motion, index, hand, and glass makers; fuzee cutters,\r\ngilders, examiners, and finishers; jewellers, keyless motion and\r\nmovement makers, and motioners.\r\n\r\nThe trade has been subject to many changes and fluctuations, and is at\r\npresent in a depressed state, owing largely to foreign competition,\r\nand the production of cheap watches by means of machinery. Efforts\r\nhave been made by more than one of the Coventry firms to meet the\r\nlatter source of competition by the introduction of machinery in the\r\nconstruction of various parts of the watch, and in the subdivision\r\nof labour, more especially in the class known as “going barrels”\r\nwith various measures of success; but for the better class of watch,\r\nthe old system bids fair to maintain its position. A project for\r\nthe establishment of technical schools for special instruction in\r\nthe various processes in connection with the Coventry staple trades\r\nin general, and that of Horology in particular, is still under\r\nconsideration, and may lead to satisfactory results. There are about\r\n150 manufacturers of watches in Coventry.\r\n\r\n=The Cycle Manufacture= was introduced into this city about 20 years\r\nago in conjunction with the making of sewing machines. The latter\r\nbranch of trade has given place almost entirely to the former, and the\r\nreputation which the various firms engaged in the trade have succeeded\r\nin obtaining, have placed Coventry in the first rank in this new and\r\npeculiar manufacture. The Coventry Machinists’ Company (Cheylesmore)\r\nwere the first to introduce this trade into this country, and it is\r\nstill one of the largest of the producers. Among the rest may be\r\nmentioned the Rudge, Premier, Singer and Co., Fleet, Centaur, Meteor,\r\nExcelsior, Wellington, Victoria, and others, all of which have some\r\nspeciality claiming some peculiar excellence.\r\n\r\n=Artistic Work in Metal= was introduced into Coventry chiefly by the\r\nexertions and artistic taste of Mr. Skidmore over 30 years ago, and\r\nhas been followed out by himself, and by various Companies in the same\r\ndirection ever since. Work from the different firms established in\r\nCoventry of great excellence, may be found in many of the principal\r\ntowns in the British Islands, and on the Continent, notably in\r\nLichfield and Hereford Cathedrals, Prince Consort Memorial, Burlington\r\nHouse, &c. Ironfounding and agricultural implement manufacturing\r\nhas also attained a high position of excellence under the firm of\r\nMatterson, Huxley, and Watson of this city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The information in this section, up to the close of 1884, is taken\r\nfrom the very accurate and interesting “History of the Corporation of\r\nBirmingham,” by J. Thackray Bunce. Two vols., 1878 and 1885.\r\n\r\n[2] In 1795 it had risen to £1,200; in 1818 to £3,000; in 1861 to\r\n£11,000; in 1880 to £21,983; and it is reckoned that at the end of the\r\ncentury the revenue of the School will be £50,000.\r\n\r\n[3] This barn and croft were taken away in 1738 from both chief master\r\nand usher, and their salaries raised in lieu to £88. 15s. 0d. and £60.\r\n\r\n[4] In all these provisions boys from the manor had the preference.\r\n\r\n[5] An alternative plan, apparently not adopted, was to have two\r\nexhibitions of £5 each, at Catherine Hall, Cambridge; and two\r\nfellowships of £30 a year each at the same college.\r\n\r\n[6] The first exhibitioners were William Milner and Bartholomew\r\nBaldwin, in 1677. Up to 1817, eighty-two exhibitioners had been\r\nelected. In 1723, however, a chancery commission declared it a manifest\r\nbreach of trust on the Governors’ part that no exhibition had been\r\ngranted for twenty years; while on January 18, 1734, _the chief master,\r\nhaving no scholars under his care_, William Spilsbury, jun., a scholar\r\nin the _usher’s_ school, was elected exhibitioner at Oxford, no other\r\nboy being qualified or likely to be qualified for some years.\r\n\r\n[7] See the illustrations in _Hutton’s_ Birmingham.\r\n\r\n[8] The first appointed were in 1752, as follows: William Latham, in\r\nDudley Street; Thomas Wilson, near the Old Cross; Mary Ankers, wife\r\nof Noel Ankers, in Freeman Street; another Widow Austin, in London\r\nPrentice Street.\r\n\r\n[9] For some reason not very clear, the _branch_ school in Shutt Lane,\r\nas also a drawing school established by the Governors, were in 1829\r\ndeclared by a decree in Chancery to be unauthorised by the charter, and\r\nwere then discontinued.\r\n\r\n[10] This was the original intention. But one of these two large\r\napartments was taken by the Governors, and the room designed for the\r\nlibrary was given to the commercial school in its place. The latter is\r\nnow the assembly room of the Girls High School.\r\n\r\n[11] It should be added that Mr. Green’s report also declares that\r\n“it is universally admitted that the present Board has discharged its\r\nduties with all care and conscientiousness.”\r\n\r\n[12] The present bailiff.\r\n\r\n[13] See the development of 1883.\r\n\r\n[14] The imposition of fees has ever been a sore point. The first\r\nreport of the new Town Council Governors was issued on January 7th,\r\n1879, and stated that they had endeavoured to reduce these fees; and in\r\n1880 they expressed their regret at their imposition.\r\n\r\n[15] In 1800, there were 120 boys: in 1850, 250 boys; in 1860, 456 boys\r\nin Grammar School, and 1080 children in the Elementary Schools: there\r\nare now 343 boys and 195 girls in the High School: 849 boys and 644\r\ngirls in the Grammar Schools. Grand total, 1493.\r\n\r\n[16] The number of Masters in the Grammar School was, in 1878, 26; in\r\nthe Elementary Schools there were 20 teachers and 21 monitors.\r\n\r\n[17] Existing rights reserved; in 1878 the Head Master had 17, and the\r\nsecond Master, 5 boarders.\r\n\r\n[18] These amounts have been greatly exceeded. The annual expenditure\r\non exhibitions is, Boys’ High School, £690; Girls, £200; Boys’ Grammar\r\nSchool, £270; Girls, £360. There is only one James Exhibition.\r\n\r\n[19] Opened September, 1883.\r\n\r\n[20] Five sums of £1,000 each for Scholarships, Prize Essays,\r\nChaplaincy, Divinity Lectureship, and Medical Tutorship.\r\n\r\n[21] _e.g._, Law, which was shortly added.\r\n\r\n[22] The arts department being henceforward regarded as preparatory to\r\nthe other two.\r\n\r\n[23] In that year the present Warden, the Rev. W. H. Poulton, came into\r\noffice, and the number immediately increased to 22.\r\n\r\n[24] The purchase value of the property was £110,000, yielding an\r\nannual rent of £3,700. £60,000 was spent upon the building and\r\nfurnishing. The total amount of the benefaction will, in the end,\r\napproach £200,000. As early as 1882, however, we find that the Council\r\n“view with regret the narrow margin that is likely to exist unless\r\nthe present endowment is supplemented by other gifts,”--[Report, p.\r\n11.]--and this anxiety is again forcibly expressed in 1885. It was\r\nrelieved in that year, however, by an “Additional Endowment Fund,” the\r\nsubscriptions to which reached £4,855.\r\n\r\n[25] In 1882, it was ordered that wives and children of Professors,\r\nLecturers, and Secretaries, who died during their term of office, be\r\nadmitted to all classes without payment.\r\n\r\n[26] Two exhibitions of £15 each, increased next year to four, awarded\r\nby the Governors of King Edward’s Schools, and a Science Scholarship\r\nof £20 a year, created by the Trustees of Piddock’s Charity, are also\r\ntenable at the College.\r\n\r\n[27] Various other societies have been formed within the college,\r\n_e.g._, Physical, Chemical, Botanical, Poesy, and French Debating\r\nSocieties.\r\n\r\n[28] The Libraries and Fine Art Gallery were shortly undertaken by the\r\ntown, and have never formed part of the work of the Institute.\r\n\r\n[29] _Paid_ Teachers were substituted in 1860.\r\n\r\n[30] The Perry Barr and Harborne Institutes had been opened previously.\r\n\r\n[31] M. Achille Albitès.\r\n\r\n[32] Now covered by the Schools of the Society of Friends, and where\r\nWyatt and Paul’s first spinning of cotton by rollers was tried.\r\n\r\n[33] The principal object of this part is to shew the development of\r\nthe parochial system, and readers will therefore kindly notice--\r\n\r\n1.--All architectural details are omitted, and will be found under the\r\nhead, “Architecture,” where there is anything special to notice.\r\n\r\n2.--Particulars as to patronage, annual value of livings, number of\r\nsittings, are, in order to economise space and prevent repetition,\r\nrelegated to a table at the end of this section, in which table all the\r\nchurches in the Borough are arranged alphabetically, irrespective of\r\nwhether they are in the parish of Birmingham, Edgbaston, or that part\r\nof Aston parish which is within the Borough.\r\n\r\n[34] For the records of these sales see a valuable paper by Mr. J. R.\r\nHolliday on St. Martin’s Church, in the Transactions for 1873 of the\r\nArchæological Section of the Birmingham and Midland Institute.\r\n\r\n[35] See the excellent monograph, “Old St. Martin’s,” by J. T. Bunce,\r\n1875.\r\n\r\n[36] A copy and translation of this interesting document will be found\r\nin Toulmin Smith’s Memorials of Old Birmingham, 1864.\r\n\r\n[37] The materials for the historical facts are to be found in the\r\n“Sketch of the History of Protestant Non-Conformity in Birmingham,” by\r\nthe Rev. J. R. Wreford, formerly minister of the New Meeting House,\r\nBirmingham, 1832, and “Protestant Non-Conformity in Birmingham,” by the\r\nRev. J. A. James, Birmingham, 1849.\r\n\r\n[38] See the interesting volume, “Memorials of the Old Meeting House\r\nand Burial Ground.” by Catherine Hutton Beale. Printed for subscribers\r\nby White and Pike, Birmingham.\r\n\r\n[39] In the order of time there was an intermediate meeting house in\r\nLivery Street, originally a circus, and used by the congregations\r\nof the Old and New Meetings, whilst those meeting houses were being\r\nrebuilt after the riots of 1791. It was afterwards occupied by a part\r\nof the Carr’s Lane congregation, on Mr. Brewer’s resignation of the\r\npastorate there in 1802, and, it becoming too small, it was resolved to\r\nbuild Ebenezer Chapel. The chapel in Livery Street was pulled down in\r\n1853, and the printing establishment of M. Billing, Sons, and Co., is\r\nbuilt on the site.\r\n\r\n[40] An excellent paper on the Old Church may be found in the third\r\nvol. of the Transactions of the Archæological Section of the Birmingham\r\nand Midland Institute.\r\n\r\n[41] The principal chemicals manufactured on a large scale\r\nare:--Sulphuric, Sulphurous, Hydrochloric, Nitric, Crude Carbolic,\r\nHydrocyanic, and Hydrofluoric Acids; Washing Soda, Bicarbonate of Soda,\r\nRochelle Salt, Glauber’s Salt, Carbonate of Potash, Bicarbonate of\r\nPotash, Chlorate of Potash, Cyanide of Potassium, Iodide of Potassium,\r\nOxalate of Potash, Bleaching Powder, Ammonia, Sulphate of Ammonia, Sal\r\nAmmoniac, Carbonate of Ammonia, Precipitated Chalk, Bisulphite of Lime,\r\nCitrate of Magnesia, Fluid Magnesia, Nitrates of Barium and Strontium,\r\nSulphate of Copper, Phosphorus, Milk of Sulphur, Tin Crystals, Benzol,\r\nToluene, Xylene, Phenol, Naphthalene, Crude Anthracene, and other Tar\r\nProducts, Fruit Essences.\r\n\r\n[42] Mungo consists of tailors’ scraps of cloth torn up into shreds,\r\nand rendered suitable for working up afresh. Shoddy is a similar\r\nmaterial, but made from old garments instead of new material.\r\n\r\n[43] A heavy knife used for cutting down sugar cane.\r\n\r\n[44] Among goldbeaters Gypsum goes by the name of talc\r\n\r\n[45] I am indebted to my colleague Mr. A. H. Hiorns for these\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n[46] Sometimes “the process is simply performed by rubbing two pieces\r\nof bone quite flat on a smooth stone, and then cutting in one of the\r\npieces the shape required, leaving a hole through to the edge by which\r\nto pour in the metal.”--Mr. C. B. Bragg.\r\n\r\n[47] For these particulars I am indebted to my colleague, Mr. A. H.\r\nIrons.\r\n\r\n[48] “Birmingham and Midland Hardware District,” edited by Samuel\r\nTimmins, London, Hardwicke, 1866.\r\n\r\n[49] The screw hand-press so generally used in Birmingham trades was\r\nthe first great means of cheapening the making of steel pens, which had\r\npreviously been made by hand, in Sheffield and London. Mr. Mitchell,\r\nMr. Joseph Gillott, and Sir Josiah Mason, were the first to make steel\r\npens by press work.--Ed.\r\n\r\n[50] This mechanism was first used by James Watt, for copying\r\nmedallions and busts, and his machines are still preserved at\r\nHeathfield Hall, Handsworth.--Ed.\r\n\r\n[51] For the Enfield-Martini of 0·4″ bore, the thickness is 0·130 inch,\r\nand the disc cut out is 1·205 in diameter.\r\n\r\n[52] I am indebted to Mr. J. W. Davis for these particulars.\r\n\r\n[53] In these cases the value of the gold is trifling as compared with\r\nthe labour expended, hence there is every confidence in the value of\r\nthe metal.\r\n\r\n[54] The statistics given have been supplied by Messrs. Crawley,\r\nParsons and Co.\r\n\r\n[55] I have been surprised to note Birmingham made pearl buttons put\r\non cards headed _Nouveauté, Paris_. I understand that many of these\r\nbuttons are sent to the United States.--C. J. W.\r\n\r\n[56] Sir William Thomson has proposed intervals corresponding to\r\nthe dots and dashes of the Morse alphabet in order to distinguish\r\nlighthouses. C. J. W.\r\n\r\n[57] It is interesting to know that Mr. Edward White Benson, father of\r\nthe present Archbishop of Canterbury, was associated with Mr. Askin in\r\nthe early experiments on extraction of nickel.\r\n\r\n[58] Mr. Henry Bore, who has been connected with the Perryan Pen Works\r\nfor nearly thirty years, has in the press a work dealing principally\r\nwith the origin of pen making. Mr. Bore’s investigation points to Mr.\r\nJohn Mitchell as the first to introduce the making of pens by means of\r\ntools principally if not entirely his invention, but there is little\r\ndoubt that the use of steel pens by the writing public is due in the\r\nfirst instance to the energy of Mr. James Perry, who was assisted in\r\nthis work by the late Sir Josiah Mason.\r\n\r\n[59] An amalgam of gold is spread on the work to be gilt. The article\r\nis then put in an oven and heated till the mercury escapes, leaving\r\nthe gold behind. Military buttons and ornaments are gilt in this\r\nmanner.--C. J. W.\r\n\r\n[60] Ramsay. Quart.
