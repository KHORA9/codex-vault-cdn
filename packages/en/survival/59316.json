It will help\r\nyou evaluate and select a new system, or get more out of the one you\r\nalready have.\r\n\r\nThe key components of computer systems you may want to know about are:\r\n\r\n Hardware--the physical equipment itself.\r\n\r\n Software--the computer programs on tape or disk, and\r\n\r\n Online sources of information--such as current market and weather\r\n information and technical reports.\r\n\r\nThis publication offers guidelines to help farmers select hardware,\r\nsoftware, and online information. (See the glossary at the end of this\r\npublication for definitions of specialized computer terms.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=What a Computer Can Do for You=\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can use a microcomputer to help you--\r\n\r\nDetermine the most economical feed ration for dairy cows and other farm\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nSchedule irrigation,\r\n\r\nGet quick access to records,\r\n\r\nKeep machinery inventories and depreciation schedules,\r\n\r\nHelp with tax records and making out income tax returns,\r\n\r\nKeep livestock breeding and production records,\r\n\r\nKeep a record of loans and cash flow to meet interest and principal\r\npayments,\r\n\r\nDetermine levels of earnings by working through a profit and loss\r\nstatement and by calculating a percentage return to capital and a\r\npercentage return to equity,\r\n\r\nDecide the optimum production choice for a particular farm in a given\r\nyear, and the optimum combination of inputs to grow the crops or\r\nlivestock chosen,\r\n\r\nStore large amounts of data, and\r\n\r\nGet current market and weather information if the microprocessor\r\nis connected via the telephone to data bases (see section on online\r\nservices).\r\n\r\nSoftware programs are also available in such areas as financial\r\nmanagement, crop and field records, mailing lists for customers of\r\ncertified seed and breeding stock, machinery purchase versus custom\r\nhiring, investment feasibility of building and livestock facilities,\r\ncommodity price charts and tables, income taxation, marketing, soil\r\nconservation, and integrated pest management.\r\n\r\nThe computer and its associated software packages can help you do four\r\nkinds of work: (1) store and manipulate records, (2) provide analyses\r\nfor management decisions, (3) control machines or monitor production,\r\nand (4) communicate faster with other people through their computers\r\nand data bases.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Recordkeeping=\r\n\r\nMany experts recommend that you start on a small scale, computerize\r\none thing at a time, and learn as you go along--rather than trying to\r\nput information on your entire farm operation into the computer all at\r\nonce. A good place to start is with farm records.\r\n\r\nYou can use microcomputers to keep track of financial records--such as\r\ncash flow, bank balances, accounts payable, accounts receivable, net\r\nworth statements, costs, and returns--as well as other records--such as\r\nlivestock breeding and production reports, crop and field records, and\r\nmailing lists.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Farm Management Analysis=\r\n\r\nAfter computerizing the farm records, the next step would be to do\r\nsimple analyses on the microprocessor. A good place to start is by\r\nanalyzing data already stored in the computer or available in the files.\r\n\r\nFor example, you could use the recordkeeping capabilities of the\r\ncomputer to record and depreciate equipment, and to decide whether it\r\nis cheaper to lease or buy farm equipment.\r\n\r\nGeneral software is available to help you with accounting and\r\nbookkeeping, basic business functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Process Controllers=\r\n\r\nBesides analyzing farm management problems and storing data, computers\r\nhave another key use--as process controllers. They can control such\r\ndevices as pumps and gates, record milk output per cow, and control\r\ngrain drying.\r\n\r\nTo save water and energy, some farmers have switched to sophisticated\r\nirrigation scheduling by programing their computers to read the\r\nmoisture in the soil, the weather, and the humidity, and to provide\r\ninformation on a plant's age and irrigation needs. The computer then\r\ntells the farmer when to water a crop and for how long--and can even\r\nturn the water on and off.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Telecommunications=\r\n\r\nYou can also use a computer as an up-to-date source for communication,\r\nlinking you to banks of information that are available almost\r\ninstantaneously from public and private online information sources.\r\nWith the computer hooked up to the telephone, you can get information\r\nquickly, receive it visually, and record it in detail if you wish.\r\n\r\nSome key information sources are listed on page 20 of this bulletin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Uses=\r\n\r\nFarm families can use microcomputers the same way other families do--to\r\nplan the family budget, keep an inventory of household furnishings,\r\nkeep track of recipes, keep mailing lists, turn lights and heat on and\r\noff, type homework and other documents, learn new skills, and play\r\ngames.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Computers on the Farm=\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the computers farmers are getting are microcomputers, also\r\ncalled home computers or personal computers. They are the basis of the\r\n\"computer revolution\" that has been occurring since the late 1970's and\r\nthey are the focus of this publication.\r\n\r\nMany farmers, especially the owners of the larger farms, already\r\nhave computers. But you don't have to be a large farmer to afford a\r\nmicrocomputer. Computers can be useful in almost all areas of a farming\r\noperation--helping you decide what, when, and how to plant; how to\r\nsell; and how to arrange the farm business to be more efficient and\r\nmore profitable.\r\n\r\nThe computer can supplement the calculator, typewriter, and file\r\ncabinet. And it can send and receive written or graphic messages by\r\ntelephone (in most areas of the country) that might be too long or\r\ncomplex to do verbally.\r\n\r\nA computer can be very useful when repetitive analyses are needed or\r\nwhen data storage is important, as with financial records or daily milk\r\noutput per cow.\r\n\r\nMore and more, farming requires sophisticated management decisions and\r\nmanagement of basic resources, including land, water, labor, production\r\ninputs, and capital. These are the kinds of decisions the computer can\r\nhelp you make faster and more cost-effectively.\r\n\r\nAlthough a computer program for your farm operation could make\r\nrecordkeeping and analysis easier and improve your ability to manage,\r\nit might be hard to measure these improvements in dollars. But the\r\ndollars you save by having better information on when to sell a crop,\r\nhow to monitor the business, and how to diagnose a problem before it\r\ngets out of control might pay for the computer. Farmers and ranchers\r\nwith large feedlot or other livestock operations might find that a feed\r\nformulation program could cut costs enough to pay for the computer\r\nsystem within a few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to Choose a Microcomputer System=\r\n\r\n\r\nShould you buy a microcomputer? How do you decide on a system that's\r\nbest for you? Here are some factors to consider in making these\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to think about your needs. What would you do with\r\nyour computer system? How would you actually use it to help you run\r\nyour operation better? List your primary needs, the important things\r\nyou want to do right away with your computer. Then, think of secondary\r\nneeds--things you might do in the future once you have a computer.\r\n\r\nOnce you've identified your needs, the next step is to shop around--to\r\nfind some software that fulfills your needs and to see some systems in\r\noperation. Go to computer stores or get in touch with the salespeople\r\nin your area. You could decide to have custom programs written for your\r\noperation, but they will be significantly more expensive than programs\r\nthat have already been developed.\r\n\r\nTalk to other farmers, ranchers, extension and university specialists,\r\nand business people who are using microcomputers. Find out what\r\nsoftware they are using. Do some research (by reading books or\r\nmagazines, taking a course or seminar, or visiting a trade show) so\r\nyou'll be an informed customer when you shop seriously.\r\n\r\nMany computer experts strongly recommend against buying a computer\r\nfirst and then shopping for the software packages. So identify your\r\nneeds and select the software packages or materials that will help you\r\ndo what you want to with your computer. Then find the hardware to run\r\nthe programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    =The Computer Revolution=\r\n\r\n    \"The advent of computers to farm management ... is already underway\r\n    and seems likely to have a powerful influence,\" said USDA historian\r\n    Wayne Rasmussen in 1982. \"The computer should lead to more efficient\r\n    management of machines and energy and should help in other farming\r\n    operations such as cost accounting, mixing feed rations and applying\r\n    fertilizers and other resources efficiently. Some farmers now have\r\n    computers of their own, and many others have access to computer\r\n    systems through their county agricultural agents,\" Rasmussen pointed\r\n    out.\r\n\r\n    The computer can be seen as the \"third revolution\" in American\r\n    farming. The first revolution was the use of the horse, which added\r\n    animal power to human power. The second was the switch from the horse\r\n    to the tractor, which again expanded the power an individual could\r\n    wield. But the computer is a different kind of technological advance\r\n    because it adds to the farmer's power to manage.\r\n\r\n    By 1990, the computer will probably be as important a part of a\r\n    commercial farmer's operation as the pickup truck. Farmers may flip\r\n    on their computers first thing in the morning--instead of their\r\n    radios--to get the latest market prices. They can get a rundown\r\n    on weather and growing conditions for major worldwide production\r\n    areas; pertinent data on prices, market conditions, credit terms,\r\n    transportation and storage rates, and related forecasts; and finally\r\n    a list of priorities each day to take advantage of these conditions.\r\n\r\n    Getting the right system--the combination of hardware (the physical\r\n    equipment) and software (the computer programs)--is the problem\r\n    farmers must solve before they can make the most of the computer\r\n    revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Strategies for Getting Into Computers=\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in getting your farm's operations computerized,\r\nand you're just starting, you could choose various strategies for doing\r\nso. One way is to first buy the basic hardware and components you think\r\nyou need, and then add memory and other components later. If you do\r\nthat, be sure you can add additional disk drives, memory, and a printer\r\nto your computer, all at a reasonable cost.\r\n\r\nWhat can you do with a small computer once you outgrow it, and you want\r\nto get a bigger one? You might want to use your older computer in a\r\nsmall, specialized farm operation, or keep it to retrieve and analyze\r\nrecords that you stored on the old equipment. Other alternatives would\r\nbe to trade it in on a larger computer, advertise to sell it through\r\nthe local want-ads, trade or sell it to a friend or neighbor, keep the\r\nsmall computer for someone else in the family (perhaps a game-playing\r\nyoungster), or donate it to a local school or religious or charitable\r\ngroup and take a tax write-off.\r\n\r\nThe farm of the future may have many computers, some for specific\r\nfunctions such as irrigation scheduling or dairy operations, and one\r\nfor financial records. Having several computers would help farmers deal\r\nwith the problem of malfunctioning computers, so that the whole farm\r\nwould not be shut down if one computer goes down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Alternatives to Buying a Microcomputer=\r\n\r\n\r\nYou might consider alternatives to buying a computer. You may be able\r\nto lease one to see what it will do for you, and use it until your\r\nneeds make it worthwhile to buy one. Prices keep coming down. The best\r\ntime to buy is when you find you can profitably make use of a computer.\r\nEven though it becomes technically obsolete, it will still do for you\r\nwhat you purchased it for.\r\n\r\nA programmable calculator may be an appropriate tool that is much less\r\ncostly then a microcomputer.\r\n\r\nIf you like what a computer can do for your operation but aren't ready\r\nto buy one or to use it yourself, you might hire a consultant to help\r\nyou select an appropriate system. Or you might retain an accountant or\r\ncomputer consultant to run the financial analysis programs you need.\r\nThis kind of service gives quick results, and relieves you of having to\r\ndo it yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Information available From Your County Extension Agent=\r\n\r\n\r\nState Cooperative Extension Services are helping States provide\r\ncomputers for county offices. Many State Extension Services already\r\nhave computers in nearly every county Extension office.\r\n\r\nIf you are considering buying or leasing a computer system, or want\r\nsoftware or timesharing services to make the most of the system you\r\nhave, a good place to go is to your State or county Extension office.\r\nIn many States, county Extension offices have terminals connecting them\r\nto mainframe computers; some have microcomputers which give them access\r\nto information on crop management, animal production, and marketing.\r\n\r\nThe county Extension staff can tell you what is available online in\r\nyour area that is tailored to your kind of farming and your region.\r\nThe Extension staff will also be able to tell you the software\r\nprograms applicable in your State. Many State Extension offices have\r\npublications on computers, and others have or are developing online\r\ninformation networks linking farmers and other users to the State\r\nuniversity mainframe computer and its data base.\r\n\r\nState Extension specialists are a logical place to start when looking\r\nfor software that is appropriate to your needs. Many State Extension\r\ncomputer and agricultural experts have produced software materials that\r\nare available, and the county agent will know about them.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the county Extension office can lend you software. If\r\nyou don't have a computer, the Extension office may be able to run\r\nprograms for you, choosing the appropriate software available and\r\nplugging in the precise conditions and problems on your farming or\r\nranching operation. Or they may be able to use the computer to search\r\nfor information you need, perhaps communicating with a large State,\r\nregional, or national data base.\r\n\r\nAs lower cost computers with improved software have become available,\r\nan increasing number of people are turning to their State Cooperative\r\nExtension Services for training in computer fundamentals, equipment\r\nselection, and software evaluation. County agents can help people find\r\nwhat is available, but they probably will not be preparing software\r\nprograms themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to Select Software=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe key criteria for selecting good software are the following: Does it\r\nmeet your needs? Does it do what it says it will do? And does it have\r\ngood support documentation?\r\n\r\n\r\n=Checklist for Evaluating Software=\r\n\r\nHere are some factors to consider when evaluating and comparing\r\nsoftware:\r\n\r\n=Documentation.= Look at the \"documentation\" or the written\r\n(paper) materials that come with your program. These should explain\r\nclearly what the program does and what you have to do to use it.\r\n\r\n=Ease of Use.= Is the program fairly easy to use? Does it guide\r\nyou through the program?\r\n\r\n=Instructions.= Another factor you should consider in evaluating\r\nsoftware is the instructions. Are there instructions in the program or\r\nin the written documentation? Are they readable? You should be sure you\r\nunderstand how to operate the program.\r\n\r\n=Help.= What help can you get if you run into problems? Does the\r\nprogram have a \"help\" function? When you don't know how to answer a\r\nquestion or need help, can you turn to a separate part of the computer\r\nprogram or to a part of the accompanying documentation to answer your\r\nquestion? Is there a company phone-in service you can call if you need\r\nhelp?\r\n\r\nSome software programs may come to you with bugs (errors) in them. Find\r\nout what backup services are available. Is there a hotline you can call\r\nfor help if the program has a problem you can't solve? Does the company\r\nprovide updated versions periodically? Are they free or at nominal cost?\r\n\r\n=Compatibility with Hardware.= Is the software compatible with\r\nhardware you already have, or does it run on an operating system you\r\ncan use with your hardware?\r\n\r\nSome computers use tape cassettes, like audio tape you use on a tape\r\nrecorder. The most standard storage medium for programs and data is\r\nthe floppy diskette, which looks like a soft phonograph record. The\r\ndiskette comes in several sizes--the most common are 8 inches and 5¼\r\ninches. A newer possibility is the 8-inch hard disk. The hard disk may\r\nbe used for storage, but you buy the software on a floppy disk and\r\ntransfer it.\r\n\r\n=Memory.= Does your computer have enough memory to run the program?\r\n\r\n=Recommendation.= Does the program come from a reputable source,\r\nor does it come with a recommendation from someone you trust?\r\n\r\n=Effectiveness.= Does the program do what you want it to do\r\ncorrectly and consistently?\r\n\r\n\r\n=Where to Look for Good Software=\r\n\r\nWhere do you find good software? Some farmers and ranchers write their\r\nown programs or pay a programmer to write a custom program. But most\r\nget existing programs either from State Extension sources or from\r\ncommercial outlets.\r\n\r\nMany operations farmers need to perform on a computer can be done\r\nby using generalized software packages readily available through\r\ncommercial sources.\r\n\r\nCheck with your County Extension Agent. He or she may know of the\r\nprograms that have been tailored for your operation. The Extension\r\nService has published a directory of agricultural software programs\r\nproduced by State Extension Services, entitled \"Updated Inventory of\r\nAgricultural Computer Programs.\"[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: To order a copy, send $3.50, payable to the University of\r\nFlorida, to\r\n\r\n  Administrative Services\r\n  Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS) Bldg. 664\r\n  University of Florida\r\n  Gainesville, FL\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere are also various private directories of software that is\r\ncompatible for particular equipment. You can get these programs at\r\ncomputer stores or through mail-order sources. Many trade journals\r\ncarry ads of agricultural software vendors.\r\n\r\nThe land-grant university in your State may have computer programs\r\navailable for farmers at nominal cost. Many States have produced\r\nextensive computer software. There are also many commercial software\r\nhouses that produce computer programs in the field of agriculture. The\r\nbest programs are written by people who combine strong expertise in the\r\nagricultural subject matter with the ability to write good computer\r\nprograms that are relatively \"friendly\" or easy to use.\r\n\r\nThe 1980's have seen a big jump in the number, quality, and\r\nfriendliness of agricultural software. But you still need to evaluate\r\ncarefully the programs you are considering. Remember that software\r\nselection and evaluation are important factors to consider when\r\nplanning a computer system for your farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Compatibility Counts=\r\n\r\n\r\nComputers and marriages should share one thing in common:\r\nCompatibility. If it's not there, the system won't work.\r\n\r\nNot all hardware and software are compatible. In fact, hundreds of\r\nproducers of computer equipment and computer programs are in the\r\nmarket, and there are few across-the-board standards. So it's important\r\nto get hardware and software that are compatible.\r\n\r\nSoftware, or the computer programs themselves, are not like records\r\nthat can be played on any record player. They have to be compatible\r\nwith the hardware in terms of the programing language used, operating\r\nsystem, size, format, and other factors.\r\n\r\nTry to find a store in your area where you will get the expertise you\r\nneed to obtain the right combination of software and hardware to meet\r\nyour needs.\r\n\r\nWhen you buy a computer, find out whether it comes with a standard\r\noperating language that will allow you to use a wide variety of\r\nprograms written in different languages on your computer. Even then,\r\nyou may find that a disk that supposedly works with that operating\r\nlanguage will not work on your machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to Select Hardware=\r\n\r\n\r\n=Checklist for Evaluating Hardware=\r\n\r\nHere are some factors to consider when evaluating and comparing\r\nhardware:\r\n\r\n=Software.= The first questions to ask are, \"What software do you\r\nplan to use?\" and \"Which computer will run that program?\"\r\n\r\nDoes the computer come with a standard operating system so that it will\r\nbe compatible with a range of software programs?\r\n\r\n=Memory.= How much memory, or information storage capacity, do\r\nyou need? The computer's memory is measured in kilobytes (abbreviated\r\nK), and most computers come in sizes ranging from 2K up to 256K. (A\r\nkilobyte is equal to roughly 1,000 characters.) You need to know the\r\nsoftware program you will use and your recordkeeping requirements to\r\naccurately estimate the capacity of the equipment you need.\r\n\r\nSome agricultural programs use 48K or 64K of memory. User friendly\r\nprograms, which require little training to use and which guide you\r\nthrough the program, may be easier; but they may require more memory\r\nfor the program itself, leaving you less storage space or memory for\r\nthe data.\r\n\r\n=Computation.= What kind of computational ability do you want\r\nyour computer to have? Will it serve the computing needs you have\r\nidentified for now and later?\r\n\r\n=Input and Output Devices.= What kind of output do you need? What\r\nadditional pieces of equipment or peripherals (such as separate screen,\r\ndisk drive, modem, printer) will you need to buy to make this system do\r\nwhat you want it to?\r\n\r\nMost agricultural programs require a printer. A dot matrix printer\r\n(which produces characters made of small dots) may be sufficient.\r\nAnother option is a letter quality printer, which is more expensive.\r\n\r\nHow big a screen do you need? (Screens are measured in characters and\r\nin inches.) Do you need an 80-column or 40-column monitor? Do you need\r\ncolor and strong graphics capability? What quality screen image do you\r\nneed?\r\n\r\nCan you add memory and other components later if you need to?\r\n\r\n=External Storage.= What kind of external storage does the system\r\nuse, floppy disk, hard disk, or tape? Cassette tape storage costs less,\r\nbut compared to disk storage, it has several disadvantages.\r\n\r\nIf the hardware uses floppy disks, is the disk drive included as part\r\nof the computer package or does it come separately? Is a second disk\r\ndrive included in the package or does it come separately? What kind of\r\na disk drive(s) do you need, single or double density? Hard or floppy?\r\n\r\n=Training.= What training is available in the use of the new\r\nequipment?\r\n\r\n=Backup and Maintenance Services.= What backup and maintenance\r\nservices are available from the vendor or other sources, once you've\r\nbought this computer?\r\n\r\nWhat happens when the computer is down (not working)? Does the company\r\nor store from which you plan to buy offer a service contract, and how\r\nmuch does it cost? Will you have to carry your computer to their site\r\nfor servicing, and how long are you likely to be without it? How far\r\naway is your dealer and where will the computer actually be serviced?\r\n\r\nIt's important to buy something that you can have fixed fairly quickly\r\nand cheaply, since elements of your system, especially the mechanical\r\nparts, may well need repair at some time.\r\n\r\n=Value.= What equipment and software programs come with the basic\r\npackage, and are these items included in the base price?\r\n\r\nCompare prices carefully, considering the components and software you\r\nare getting for a particular price. Do not buy on the basis of price\r\nalone, but consider also the reliability of the equipment and the\r\nvendor, and the service you will be getting to set up, maintain, and\r\nsupport your system.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Where to Look for Good Hardware=\r\n\r\nMany buyers get their computers at specialty stores that handle\r\ncomputers and other electronics. Some handle only one brand of\r\ncomputer. It's worthwhile to shop around and see various systems. The\r\nbig national department store chains sell computers, too. Talk to\r\nyour neighbors about what they're using, and be sure to get hands-on\r\npractice with systems you are considering.\r\n\r\nTry to find a reputable dealer who can offer backup support. Consider\r\nthe pros and cons of getting all equipment from a single vendor\r\nversus shopping around for peripherals from different manufacturers.\r\nA reliable dealer who handles several brands can help you make this\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nCheck with your Extension office. It may have a State publication on\r\ncomputers or a checklist for buying one.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Types of Hardware=\r\n\r\nFarmers are using several different types of computers. Besides the\r\nmicrocomputer, which is the most widely used, other kinds of farm\r\ncomputers include interactive terminals, videotex terminals, handheld\r\nprocessors, and minicomputers.\r\n\r\nA microcomputer can be used as a stand-alone unit, working on its\r\nown with a software disk or tape. Or it can be connected to outside\r\ninformation sources if it is equipped with a device known as a modem,\r\nwhich allows the computer to communicate with other computers over the\r\ntelephone. The modem turns the computer from an information processor\r\nand storage machine into a piece of communications equipment.\r\n\r\nAn interactive terminal has no data storage capability but is linked\r\nto a central computer through the telephone. This is called a \"dumb\"\r\nterminal because it can receive, display, and send information, but it\r\ncannot process that information. Programs and data are stored in the\r\ncentral computer and the user pays a fee to access the system.\r\n\r\nA videotex keyboard terminal can be connected to a telephone jack\r\nand any television set. The user can request and receive any kind of\r\ninformation stored in the central computer. Some of the online services\r\nuse this type of equipment (see section about online information\r\nsystems on page 20).\r\n\r\nMany farmers are also using handheld programmable calculators. These\r\nare convenient to use in the field, and can record often repeated data,\r\nsuch as daily milk production. They have little memory (usually 2K) and\r\ntheir output can be printed on 2-inch paper tape. They are much cheaper\r\nthan the microcomputer.\r\n\r\nFarmers use them to record daily milk production, formulate dairy\r\nand beef rations, estimate value of dairy forages, estimate cost of\r\noperating farm machinery, and calculate depreciation and investment tax\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\nSome very large farm operations use minicomputers, which are larger,\r\nhave more memory, can do more functions than the microcomputers, and\r\ncan support multiple users. However, the newer microcomputers have more\r\nmemory and more functions, and the difference between minicomputers and\r\nmicrocomputers has narrowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Computer System Components=\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Printer; Display Screen; Telephone/Modem; Disk Drive;\r\nFloppy Disk; and Central Processor with Keyboard]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Components of a Microcomputer=\r\n\r\n\r\nOne way to understand how a microcomputer works is to see its key\r\ncomponents.\r\n\r\nThe =central processing unit= (CPU) is the silicon chip that is\r\nthe \"brain\" of the computer. It does all the computation and controls\r\nall the other processing.\r\n\r\nThe CPU stores =memory= of several kinds. Part of the memory\r\nis wired into the computer permanently by the manufacturer. This is\r\ncalled Read Only Memory (ROM). It contains such things as the operating\r\nsystem and program language. Random Access Memory (RAM) is the memory\r\nbank that includes the computer program or instructions, as well as\r\nthe data. Your storage devices--tape cassettes, floppy disks, or hard\r\ndisks--that store computer programs and data, are sometimes called\r\nexternal memory.\r\n\r\nThe computer system also needs =input devices= and =output\r\ndevices=. Your keyboard is an input device; disk drives and tape\r\ndrives are also input devices. The output will probably be a cathode\r\nray tube (CRT), which looks like a video monitor. The printer is the\r\nother output device you may choose to include in your computer system.\r\n\r\nMake sure the microcomputer has an adequate number of input and output\r\nports for future needs.\r\n\r\nIf you use your computer for communications, you'll need a telephone\r\n=modem=.\r\n\r\nHere is a possible shopping list of hardware for a farmer's starting\r\nmicrocomputer system:\r\n\r\nCPU (computer) with 48K or 64K of memory.\r\n\r\nCRT or monitor with adequate character width for the programs you plan\r\nto use.\r\n\r\nOne or two disk drives, either 5¼ or 8 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nDot matrix printer (optional).\r\n\r\nModem for communication with large computer (optional).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Try it Out=\r\n\r\n\r\nBe sure you try the system you plan to buy. Test run on a sample\r\nproblem the hardware and software combination you are considering\r\nusing. See if you think the solutions the computer puts out are what\r\nyou need.\r\n\r\nIf you insist on a thorough demonstration of the material you are\r\nconsidering buying, you can evaluate it in terms of its ease of use and\r\nthe usefulness of its analysis.\r\n\r\nIf you're thinking of buying a new software package for a computer you\r\nalready have, ask to try it out first. Some software distributors in\r\nthe public sector will give you a trial period to make sure the program\r\nis satisfactory and runs on your equipment. Or you may be able to\r\nobtain a demonstration disk. At least, try out new programs with the\r\nsame microprocessor, printer, and screen you use to make sure they will\r\nwork on your equipment.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to have software evaluated by a reputable source--for\r\nexample your local county Extension agent, State Extension specialist,\r\nor a neighbor who has had experience.\r\n\r\n\"Let the buyer beware\" is a good motto to remember as you shop around\r\nfor a computer system.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 =Getting Comfortable with Computers=\r\n\r\n    If you can use a typewriter, you can use a computer. Most\r\n    agricultural program's do not require particular math or technical\r\n    skills, just a knowledge of your farming operation and the ability\r\n    to think in a logical, orderly way. Most new programs are user\r\n    friendly; they ask you questions in plain English, and you type the\r\n    answer on the keyboard.\r\n\r\n    A good way to feel comfortable with computers is to try one out at\r\n    your local computer store, or at fairs, conferences, or workshops\r\n    at universities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Computers Need an Investment in Time and Money=\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to considering the cost of a computer system, consider the\r\ntime and effort it takes to learn the equipment and the programs, and\r\nto keep records. Who will be operating the microcomputer? Does he or\r\nshe have the patience and skills to learn to operate the computer, and\r\nto enter the large amounts of data that will be required initially?\r\n\r\nThe computer may save time and money. Many farmers find that they don't\r\nsave time but they accomplish more in the time they do spend. Don't\r\nunderestimate the amount of time and effort it will require to collect\r\ndata, make sure it's accurate, enter the data, and run the analyses.\r\n\r\nIt's important to consider how user-friendly the computer is, and how\r\nmuch the computer's software will do to guide you through the analysis.\r\n\r\nA computer will do calculations very quickly, perhaps saving hours of\r\nlaborious figuring. A computer will store information from one time\r\nperiod to the next, and recalculate alternatives quickly. By making the\r\ninformation available, it will help you identify strong and weak points\r\nin your operation.\r\n\r\nHowever, these functions will depend on your data. If the records you\r\nuse in making a computation are incomplete, for example, the computer\r\ncannot fill in the gaps for you nor overcome inaccuracies in the data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Information available Online From USDA, State, and Private\r\nSources=\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can transform your own microprocessor or other computer into\r\na powerful communications device by adding a modem to it and\r\ncommunicating over the telephone.\r\n\r\nThis will help you gather information on news, weather forecasts,\r\nemergencies or disasters, crop and livestock production, and marketing\r\n(including current and future prices).\r\n\r\nOnline computer services also include buying and selling farm products;\r\npurchasing farm and home supplies, including teleshopping; banking\r\nservices; business management advice; ordering theater tickets;\r\ninformation concerning farm and public policy; and personal education\r\nand entertainment.\r\n\r\nMany farmers who are computerizing their operations, as well as others\r\nin agriculture, can use some form of online information. There are\r\nmore than 1,300 public and private information sources available\r\non computer. New ones seem to come out every week. The following\r\nselected list of information you can receive on computer includes some\r\nof the major private online information services with agricultural\r\napplications, as well as the main ones available from USDA and the\r\nState land-grant institutions.\r\n\r\nMost of these information networks are paid for by the user based on\r\nthe amount of use. Many charge an initial fee, and then most charge the\r\nuser by the amount of time he or she spends on the system.\r\n\r\nNo one computer system or online system may be adequate for everyone.\r\nThere are many good systems, and different systems are good for\r\ndifferent tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n=1. AGNET=\r\n\r\nAGNET is a major online information and problem-solving service for\r\nfarmers, ranchers, agribusinesses, and homes. It is sponsored jointly\r\nby five State Cooperative Extension Services--Nebraska, Montana, North\r\nDakota, South Dakota, and Washington--and operated by the University of\r\nNebraska. County Extension offices in several States participate, and\r\nfarmers in nearly all the 50 States and Canada subscribe to AGNET.\r\n\r\nIt helps people make marketing and production decisions and solve\r\nagricultural management problems, and it provides current information\r\non market conditions and news items. It offers cash and futures\r\nmarket reports, international market reports from the U.S. Department\r\nof Agriculture (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), reports\r\nand report abstracts from the USDA's Economic Research Service and\r\nStatistical Reporting Service, and market comments by Extension Service\r\neconomists. Also available are electronic mail service and electronic\r\nconferencing, which allows groups of users with similar interests to\r\nshare ideas and information.\r\n\r\nFarmers and ranchers who have computer terminals with communication\r\ncapability can access AGNET. Others can tap into AGNET through their\r\ncounty Extension services. AGNET subscribers are typically agricultural\r\nlenders and bankers. Extension specialists, farm managers, home\r\neconomists, agricultural consulting firms, farmers and ranchers, and\r\nexporters of agricultural commodities.\r\n\r\n  ADDRESS: AGNET\r\n           University of Nebraska\r\n           105 Miller Hall\r\n           University of Nebraska\r\n           Lincoln, NE 68583\r\n\r\n\r\n=2.

NEMA (National Electronic Marketing Association, Inc.)=\r\n\r\nNEMA offers marketing firms computerized marketing systems for many\r\nagricultural products. It is a way of linking buyers and sellers\r\nwithout having to first transport the products to market.\r\n\r\nElectronic marketing enables buyers and sellers to negotiate\r\ntransactions in a public market while remaining in their own offices.\r\nNEMA is developing several marketing systems for agricultural markets.\r\nNEMA was developed by Virginia Tech Extension and Research staff in\r\ncooperation with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Commerce\r\nand AMS.\r\n\r\nThrough a telephone hookup to computer terminals in any location,\r\nbuyers and sellers are brought together at a specific time to determine\r\nthe price, on a competitive basis, for the products being offered\r\nfor sale. Prospective buyers can obtain written descriptions of the\r\nproducts before sale time.\r\n\r\nOne pricing technique is a computerized auction process, where the\r\ncomputer acts as the auctioneer. During the auction, the computer drops\r\nthe asking price until a bid is received, then raises the price from\r\nthat point until there is only one bidder left. At the end of a sale,\r\nthe highest bidders receive summaries of their purchases. The products\r\nare shipped efficiently from seller to buyer.\r\n\r\nState Cooperative Extension Services, producers' organizations. State\r\ndepartments of agriculture, and other agencies have developed and\r\nimplemented NEMA, as well as some other electronic marketing systems in\r\nthe United States. Today computerized systems sell slaughter and feeder\r\nlivestock, cotton, and shell eggs.\r\n\r\nThis system is for market agents and buyers.\r\n\r\n  ADDRESS: National Electronic Marketing Assn., Inc.\r\n           P.O.

USDA Online=\r\n\r\nUSDA Online delivers news and other current information from USDA's\r\nOffice of Information. Services include the following reports as they\r\nare released: (1) USDA national news releases about policy and program\r\nannouncements, (2) USDA regional and State news releases about program\r\nannouncements, (3) outlook and situation report summaries, (4) Crop\r\nReporting Board reports, report highlights, and summaries, (5) Foreign\r\nAgricultural Service reports and announcements on foreign crops, world\r\nproduction, and trade, (6) Economic Research Service report abstracts,\r\n(7) a daily agricultural news summary called \"AG a.m.,\" and (8) a\r\nweekly \"Farm Paper Letter\" for farm magazine and newspaper editors and\r\nothers interested in the summary and highlights of USDA reports for the\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nThrough USDA Online, users can also access COIN (see p. 24-25) and\r\nseveral other data bases. Another communications network available\r\nto users of USDA Online is an electronic mail service linking\r\nvarious offices at USDA and the State Extension Services, land-grant\r\nUniversities, State Departments of Agriculture, other Federal and State\r\nagencies, and other organizations interested in agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ADDRESS: News Division, Room 404-A\r\n           Office of Information\r\n           U.S. Department of Agriculture\r\n           Washington, D.C. 20250\r\n\r\n\r\n                        =Rural Telephone Lines=\r\n\r\n    One question to consider when you are selecting a computer system\r\n    to be used in a rural area is whether your telephone line is\r\n    adequate for potential users in your area. You must have a private\r\n    line. Line quality is also important; excessive line noise or\r\n    dips and surges in power may cause the communications system to\r\n    disconnect you.\r\n\r\n    In the future, farmers will be able to get information by satellite\r\n    rather than through the phone, which could eventually be a cost\r\n    saver for those who are far from the information source.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Computer Developments at USDA=\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides online information services, there are several other computer\r\ndevelopments available through USDA that are of use to\r\n\r\nfarmers and ranchers. Many USDA agencies are using computers to\r\ndisseminate information. Here is a partial list:\r\n\r\nSince 1981, the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) has been releasing\r\ninformation electronically that previously had been distributed as\r\npublications through the mail.\r\n\r\nThe FAS electronic information system includes agricultural trade leads\r\nreceived from agricultural attaches relating to potential purchases of\r\ncommodities by foreign buyers.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), in cooperation with the\r\nExtension Service, has developed two software packages to help farmers\r\nmake decisions about the kind and amount of crop insurance they will\r\nneed. ARCIE (All Risk Crop Insurance Evaluation) comes in \"mini\" and\r\n\"complete\" versions.\r\n\r\nMini-ARCIE takes individual farm data and calculates a projected cash\r\nflow under various yield conditions with and without crop insurance. It\r\ntakes about 15 minutes to run.\r\n\r\nComplete-ARCIE, which takes about an hour, analyzes risk and loss\r\nprobabilities over an extended period. It prompts farmers to enter\r\nexpected prices and yields, and to include historical data.\r\n\r\nBoth programs examine the insurance options available--both public and\r\nprivate--and show how these options compare and how they complement\r\neach other. Federal Crop Insurance is currently available on about 30\r\nmajor crops nationwide.\r\n\r\nThese programs are designed to run on most microcomputer models. Your\r\nState Extension Service, State Vocational Education Office, or your\r\nlocal crop insurance agent may already have the programs.\r\n\r\nFor further information, including how to obtain a copy of the program,\r\nwrite to:\r\n\r\n  The ARCIE Project\r\n  Department of Agricultural Economics\r\n  107 Agricultural Building\r\n  Texas A&M University\r\n  College Station, TX 77840\r\n\r\nThe =Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service= (ASCS)\r\nis planning to put small computers into all its county offices starting\r\nin 1985. They will keep lists of farmers and their acreage allotments\r\nand bases, record set-aside histories, and record and maintain the\r\nother myriad facts necessary to make the USDA farm programs work.\r\nThe system will keep farm records, addresses for mailings, election\r\nregisters, and records of payments. Even checks to pay farmers will be\r\nproduced by the decentralized county computer systems.\r\n\r\nThe computers will also be tied into State systems and a central\r\ncomputer for some recordkeeping functions, and can be used for\r\nelectronic mail and other communications.\r\n\r\nOne function of the new system will be to mesh FAS trade opportunity\r\nleads into the ASCS data base. This will permit a farmer or local\r\nagribusiness person to go into the ASCS office and immediately learn\r\nabout trade leads reported by agricultural attaches. This program will\r\ngo into operation during the mid-1980's.\r\n\r\nThe =Economic Research Service= (ERS) releases its Outlook and\r\nSituation reports through AGNET. Summaries of these are available\r\nthrough USDA Online.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Learning More About Computers on the Farm=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe computer field is changing so fast that it is difficult to keep\r\nup with the changes. One way to keep current is to join a users group\r\nfor your particular brand of computer, or an agricultural users group.\r\nAnother way to get up-to-date information about new computer hardware\r\nand software products is to read a private newsletter.
