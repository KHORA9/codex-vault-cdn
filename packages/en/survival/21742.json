BALLANTYNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nADRIFT ON THE OCEAN.\r\n\r\nOn a certain morning, not very long ago, the sun, according to his\r\nancient and admirable custom, rose at a very early hour, and casting his\r\nbright beams far and wide over the Pacific, lighted up the yellow sands\r\nand the verdant hills of one of the loveliest of the islands of that\r\nmighty sea.\r\n\r\nIt was early morning, as we have said, and there was plenty of life--\r\nanimal as well as vegetable--to be seen on land and sea, and in the\r\nwarm, hazy atmosphere.  But there were no indications of man's presence\r\nin that beautiful scene.  The air was perfectly calm, yet the gentle\r\nswell of the ocean terminated in great waves, which came rolling in like\r\nwalls of glass, and fell on the coral-reef like rushing snow-wreaths\r\nwith a roar as loud as thunder.\r\n\r\nThousands of sea-birds screamed and circled in the sky.  Fish leaped\r\nhigh out of their native element into the air, as if they wished to\r\ncatch the gulls, while the gulls, seemingly smitten with a similar\r\ndesire, dived into the water as if they wished to catch the fish.  It\r\nmight have been observed, however, that while the fish never succeeded\r\nin catching the gulls, the latter very frequently caught the fish, and,\r\nwithout taking the trouble to kill them, bolted them down alive.\r\n\r\nCocoanut-palms cast the shadows of their long stems and graceful tops\r\nupon the beach, while, farther inland, a dense forest of tropical\r\nplants--bread-fruit trees, bananas, etcetera--rose up the\r\nmountain-sides.  Here and there open patches might be seen, that looked\r\nlike fields and lawns, but there were no cottages or villas.  Droves of\r\npigs rambled about the valleys and on the hill-sides, but they were wild\r\npigs.  No man tended them.  The bread-fruits, the cocoanuts, the\r\nbananas, the plantains, the plums, all were beautiful and fit for food,\r\nbut no man owned them or used them, for, like many other spots in that\r\nsea of coral isles and savage men, the island was uninhabited.\r\n\r\nIn all the wide expanse of ocean that surrounded that island, there was\r\nnothing visible save one small, solitary speck on the far-off horizon.\r\nIt might have been mistaken for a seagull, but it was in reality a\r\nraft--a mass of spars and planks rudely bound together with ropes.  A\r\nboat's mast rose from the centre of it, on which hung a rag of sail, and\r\na small red flag drooped motionless from its summit.  There were a few\r\ncasks on the highest part of the raft, but no living soul was visible.\r\nNevertheless, it was not without tenants.  In a hollow between two of\r\nthe spars, under the shadow of one of the casks, lay the form of a man.\r\nThe canvas trousers, cotton shirt, blue jacket, and open necktie,\r\nbespoke him a sailor, but it seemed as though there were nothing left\r\nsave the dead body of the unfortunate tar, so pale and thin and ghastly\r\nwere his features.  A terrier dog lay beside him, so shrunken that it\r\nlooked like a mere scrap of door-matting.  Both man and dog were\r\napparently dead, but they were not so in reality, for, after lying about\r\nan hour quite motionless, the man slowly opened his eyes.\r\n\r\nAh, reader, it would have touched your heart to have seen those eyes!\r\nThey were so deep set, as if in dark caverns, and so unnaturally large.\r\nThey gazed round in a vacant way for a few moments, until they fell on\r\nthe dog.  Then a gleam of fire shot through them, and their owner raised\r\nhis large, gaunt, wasted frame on one elbow, while he gazed with a look\r\nof eagerness, which was perfectly awful, at his dumb companion.\r\n\r\n\"Not dead _yet_!\" he said, drawing a long sigh.\r\n\r\nThere was a strange, incongruous mixture of satisfaction and discontent\r\nin the remark, which was muttered in a faint whisper.\r\n\r\nAnother gleam shot through the large eyes.  It was not a pleasant look.\r\nSlowly, and as if with difficulty, the man drew a clasp-knife from his\r\npocket, and opened it.  As he did so, his brows lowered and his teeth\r\nbecame clenched.  It was quite plain what he meant to do.  As he held\r\nthe open knife over the dog's head, he muttered, \"Am I to die for the\r\nsake of a _dog_!\"\r\n\r\nEither the terrier's slumbers had come to an end naturally, at a\r\nfortunate moment, or the master's voice had awakened it, for it opened\r\nits eyes, raised its head, and looked up in the sailor's face.  The hand\r\nwith the knife drooped a little.  The dog rose and licked it.  Hunger\r\nhad done its work on the poor creature, for it could hardly stand, yet\r\nit managed to look in its master's face with that grave, simple gaze of\r\nself-forgetting love, which appears to be peculiar to the canine race.\r\nThe savage glare of the seaman's eyes vanished.  He dropped the knife.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Cuffy; thanks for stoppin' me.  It would have been _murder_!\r\nNo, no, my doggie, you and I shall die together.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice sank into a murmur, partly from weakness and partly from the\r\nideas suggested by his concluding words.\r\n\r\n\"Die together!\" he repeated, \"surely it ain't come to that _yet_.  Wot,\r\nJohn Jarwin, you're not goin' to give in like that, are you? to haul\r\ndown your colours on a fine day with a clear sky like this overhead?\r\nCome, cheer up, lad; you're young and can hold out a good while yet.\r\nHey, old dog, wot say _you_?\"\r\n\r\nThe dog made a motion that would, in ordinary circumstances, have\r\nresulted in the wagging of its tail, but the tail was powerless to\r\nrespond.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a gull flew towards the raft; Jarwin watched it eagerly\r\nas it approached.  \"Ah,\" he muttered, clasping his bony hand as tightly\r\nover his heart as his strength would allow and addressing the gull, \"if\r\nI only had hold of _you_, I'd tear you limb from limb, and drink your\r\nblood!\"\r\n\r\nHe watched the bird intently as it flew straight over him.  Leaning\r\nback, he continued slowly to follow its flight, until his head rested on\r\nthe block of wood which had served him for a pillow.  The support felt\r\nagreeable, he forgot the gull, closed his eyes, and sank with a deep\r\nsigh into a slumber that strongly resembled death.\r\n\r\nPresently he awoke with a start, and, once more raising himself, gazed\r\nround upon the sea.  No ship was to be seen.  How often he had gazed\r\nround the watery circle with the same anxious look only to meet with\r\ndisappointment!  The hills of the coral island were visible like a blue\r\ncloud on the horizon, but Jarwin's eyes were too dim and worn out to\r\nobserve them.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" he exclaimed, suddenly, scrambling to his feet, \"rouse up,\r\nCuffy; you an' I ain't a-goin' to die without a good fight for life.\r\nCome along, my hearty; we'll have another glass of grog--Adam's grog it\r\nis, but it has been good grog to you an' me, doggie--an' then we shall\r\nhave another inspection o' the locker; mayhap there's the half of a\r\ncrumb left.\"\r\n\r\nThe comparatively cheery tone in which the sailor said this seemed to\r\ninvigorate the dog, for it rose and actually succeeded in wriggling its\r\ntail as it staggered after its master--indubitable sign of hope and love\r\nnot yet subdued!\r\n\r\nJarwin went to a cask which still contained a small quantity of fresh\r\nwater.  Three weeks before the point at which we take up his story, a\r\nstorm had left him and his dog the sole survivors on the raft of the\r\ncrew of a barque which had sprung a leak, and gone to the bottom.  His\r\nprovision at the time was a very small quantity of biscuit and a cask of\r\nfresh water.  Several days before this the last biscuit had been\r\nconsumed but the water had not yet failed.  Hitherto John Jarwin had\r\nhusbanded his provisions, but now, feeling desperate, he drank deeply of\r\nthe few remaining drops of that liquid which, at the time, was almost as\r\nvital to him as his life-blood.  He gave a full draught also to the\r\nlittle dog.\r\n\r\n\"Share and share alike, doggie,\" he said, patting its head, as it\r\neagerly lapped up the water; \"but there's no wittles, Cuffy, an' ye\r\ndon't care for baccy, or ye should be heartily welcome to a quid.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the sailor supplied his own cheek with a small piece of his\r\nfavourite weed, and stood up on the highest part of the raft to survey\r\nthe surrounding prospect.  He did so without much hope, for \"hope\r\ndeferred\" had at last made his heart sick.  Suddenly his wandering gaze\r\nbecame fixed and intense.  He shaded his eyes with one hand, and\r\nsteadied himself against the mast with the other.  There could be no\r\ndoubt of it!  \"Land ho!\" he shouted, with a degree of strength that\r\nsurprised himself, and even drew from Cuffy the ghost of a bark.  On the\r\nstrength of the discovery Jarwin and his dumb friend immediately treated\r\nthemselves to another glass of Adam's grog.\r\n\r\nBut poor Jarwin had his patience further tried.  Hours passed away, and\r\nstill the island seemed as far off as ever.  Night drew on, and it\r\ngradually faded from his view.  But he had unquestionably seen land; so,\r\nwith this to comfort him, the starving tar lay down beside his dog to\r\nspend another night--as he had already spent many days and nights--a\r\ncastaway on the wide ocean.\r\n\r\nMorning dawned, and the sailor rose with difficulty.  He had forgotten,\r\nfor a moment, the discovery of land on the previous night, but it was\r\nbrought suddenly to his remembrance by the roar of breakers near at\r\nhand.  Turning in the direction whence the sound came, he beheld an\r\nisland quite close to him, with heavy \"rollers\" breaking furiously on\r\nthe encircling ring of the coral-reef.  The still water between the reef\r\nand the shore, which was about a quarter of a mile wide, reflected every\r\ntree and crag of the island, as if in a mirror.  It was a grand, a\r\nglorious sight, and caused Jarwin's heart to swell with emotions that he\r\nhad never felt before; but his attention was quickly turned to a danger\r\nwhich was imminent, and which seemed to threaten the total destruction\r\nof his raft, and the loss of his life.\r\n\r\nA very slight breeze--a mere zephyr--which had carried him during the\r\nnight towards the island, was now bearing him straight, though slowly,\r\ndown on the reef, where, if he had once got involved in the breakers,\r\nthe raft must certainly have been dashed to pieces; and he knew full\r\nwell, that in his weak condition, he was utterly incapable of contending\r\nwith such a surf.\r\n\r\nBeing a man of promptitude, his first act, on making this discovery, was\r\nto lower the sail.  This was, fortunately, done in time; had he kept it\r\nup a few minutes longer, he must inevitably have passed the only opening\r\nin the reef that existed on that side of the island.  This opening was\r\nnot more than fifty yards wide.  To the right and left of it the\r\nbreakers on the reef extended, in lines of seething foam.  Already the\r\nraft was rolling in the commotion caused by these breakers, as it\r\ndrifted towards the opening.\r\n\r\nJarwin was by no means devoid of courage.  Many a time, in days gone by,\r\nwhen his good ship was tossing on the stormy sea, or scudding under bare\r\npoles, had he stood on the deck with unshaken confidence and a calm\r\nheart, but now he was face to face with the seaman's most dreaded\r\nenemy--\"breakers ahead!\"--nay, worse, breakers around him everywhere,\r\nsave at that one narrow passage, which appeared so small, and so\r\ninvolved in the general turmoil, as to afford scarcely an element of\r\nhope.  For the first time in his life Jarwin's heart sank within him--at\r\nleast so he said in after years while talking of the event--but we\r\nsuspect that John was underrating himself.  At all events, he showed no\r\nsymptoms of fear as he sat there calmly awaiting his fate.\r\n\r\nAs the raft approached the reef, each successive roller lifted it up and\r\ndropped it behind more violently, until at last the top of one of the\r\nglittering green walls broke just as it passed under the end of the raft\r\nnearest the shore.  Jarwin now knew that the next billow would seal his\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nThere was a wide space between each of those mighty waves.  He looked\r\nout to sea, and beheld the swell rising and taking form, and increasing\r\nin speed as it came on.  Calmly divesting himself of his coat and boots,\r\nhe sat down beside his dog, and awaited the event.  At that moment he\r\nobserved, with intense gratitude to the Almighty, that the raft was\r\ndrifting so straight towards the middle of the channel in the reef, that\r\nthere seemed every probability of being carried through it; but the hope\r\nthus raised was somewhat chilled by the feeling of weakness which\r\npervaded his frame.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Cuffy,\" said he, patting the terrier gently, \"rouse up, my doggie;\r\nwe must make a brave struggle for life.  It's neck or nothing this time.\r\nIf we touch that reef in passing, Cuff, you an' I shall be food for the\r\nsharks to-night, an' it's my opinion that the shark as gits us won't\r\nhave much occasion to boast of his supper.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailor ceased speaking abruptly.  As he looked back at the\r\napproaching roller he felt solemnised and somewhat alarmed, for it\r\nappeared so perpendicular and so high from his low position, that it\r\nseemed as if it would fall on and overwhelm the raft.  There was,\r\nindeed, some danger of this.  Glancing along its length, Jarwin saw that\r\nhere and there the edge was lipping over, while in one place, not far\r\noff, the thunder of its fall had already begun.  Another moment, and it\r\nappeared to hang over his head; the raft was violently lifted at the\r\nstern, caught up, and whirled onward at railway speed, like a cork in\r\nthe midst of a boiling cauldron of foam.  The roar was deafening.  The\r\ntumultuous heaving almost overturned it several times.  Jarwin held on\r\nfirmly to the mast with his right arm, and grasped the terrier with his\r\nleft hand, for the poor creature had not strength to resist such furious\r\nmotion.  It all passed with bewildering speed.  It seemed as if, in one\r\ninstant, the raft was hurled through the narrows, and launched into the\r\ncalm harbour within.  An eddy, at the inner side of the opening, swept\r\nit round, and fixed the end of one of the largest spars of which it was\r\ncomposed on the beach.\r\n\r\nThere were fifty yards or so of sandy coral-reef between the beach\r\noutside, that faced the sea, and the beach inside, which faced the land;\r\nyet how great the difference!  The one beach, buffeted for ever, day and\r\nnight, by the breakers--in calm by the grand successive rollers that, as\r\nit were, symbolised the ocean's latent power--in storm by the mad deluge\r\nof billows which displayed that power in all its terrible grandeur.  The\r\nother beach, a smooth, sloping circlet of fair white sand, laved only by\r\nthe ripples of the lagoon, or by its tiny wavelets, when a gale chanced\r\nto sweep over it from the land.\r\n\r\nJarwin soon gained this latter beach with Cuffy in his arms, and sat\r\ndown to rest, for his strength had been so much reduced that the mere\r\nexcitement of passing through the reef had almost exhausted him.  Cuffy,\r\nhowever, seemed to derive new life from the touch of earth again, for it\r\nran about in a staggering drunken sort of way; wagged its tail at the\r\nroot,--without, however, being able to influence the point,--and made\r\nnumerous futile efforts to bark.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of its weakly gambols the terrier chanced to discover a\r\ndead fish on the sands.  Instantly it darted forward and began to devour\r\nit with great voracity.\r\n\r\n\"Halo!  Cuffy,\" shouted Jarwin, who observed him; \"ho! hold on, you\r\nrascal! share and share alike, you know.  Here, fetch it here!\"\r\n\r\nCuffy had learned the first great principle of a good and useful life--\r\nwhether of man or beast--namely, prompt obedience.  That meek but jovial\r\nlittle dog, on receiving this order, restrained its appetite, lifted the\r\nfish in its longing jaws, and, carrying it to his master, humbly laid it\r\nat his feet.  He was rewarded with a hearty pat on the head, and a full\r\nhalf of the coveted fish--for Jarwin appeared to regard the\r\n\"share-and-share-alike\" principle as a point of honour between them.\r\n\r\nThe fish was not good, neither was it large, and of course it was raw,\r\nbesides being somewhat decayed; nevertheless, both man and dog ate it,\r\nbones and all, with quiet satisfaction.  Nay, reader, do not shudder!\r\nIf you were reduced to similar straits, you would certainly enjoy, with\r\nequal gusto, a similar meal, supposing that you had the good fortune to\r\nget it.  Small though it was, it sufficed to appease the appetite of the\r\ntwo friends, and to give them a feeling of strength which they had not\r\nexperienced for many a day.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of this feeling, Jarwin remarked to Cuffy, that \"a\r\nman could eat a-most anything when hard put to it,\" and that \"it wos now\r\nhigh time to think about goin' ashore.\"\r\n\r\nTo which Cuffy replied with a bark, which one might imagine should come\r\nfrom a dog in the last stage of whooping-cough, and with a wag of his\r\ntail--not merely at the root thereof, but a distinct wag--that extended\r\nobviously along its entire length to the extreme point.  Jarwin observed\r\nthe successful effort, laughed feebly, and said, \"Brayvo, Cuffy,\" with\r\nevident delight; for it reminded him of the days when that little shred\r\nof a door-mat, in the might of its vigour, was wont to wag its tail so\r\nviolently as to convulse its whole body, insomuch that it was difficult\r\nto decide whether the tail wagged the body, or the body the tail!\r\n\r\nBut, although Jarwin made light of his sufferings, his gaunt, wasted\r\nframe would have been a sad sight to any pitiful spectator, as with\r\nweary aspect and unsteady gait he moved about on the sandy ridge in\r\nsearch of more food, or gazed with longing eyes on the richly-wooded\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nFor it must be remembered that our castaway had not landed on the island\r\nitself, but on that narrow ring of coral-reef which almost encircled it,\r\nand from which it was separated by the lagoon, or enclosed portion of\r\nthe sea, which was, as we have said, about a quarter of a mile wide.\r\n\r\nJohn Jarwin would have thought little of swimming over that narrow belt\r\nof smooth water in ordinary circumstances, but now he felt that his\r\nstrength was not equal to such a feat.  Moreover, he knew that there\r\nwere sharks in these waters, so he dismissed the idea of swimming, and\r\ncast about in his mind how he should manage to get across.  With Jarwin,\r\naction soon followed thought.  He resolved to form a small raft out of\r\nportions of the large one.  Fortunately his clasp-knife had been\r\nattached, as seamen frequently have it, to his waist-belt, when he\r\nforsook his ship.  This was the only implement that he possessed, but it\r\nwas invaluable.  With it he managed to cut the thick ropes that he could\r\nnot have untied, and, in the course of two hours--for he laboured with\r\nextreme difficulty--a few broken planks and spars were lashed together.\r\nEmbarking on this frail vessel with his dog, he pushed off, and using a\r\npiece of plank for an oar, sculled himself over the lagoon.\r\n\r\nIt was touching, even to himself, to observe the slowness of his\r\nprogress.  All the strength that remained in him was barely sufficient\r\nto move the raft.  But the lagoon was as still as a mill-pond.  Looking\r\ndown into its clear depths, he could see the rich gardens of coral and\r\nsea-weed, among which fish, of varied and brilliant colours, sported\r\nmany fathoms below.  The air, too, was perfectly calm.\r\n\r\nVery slowly he left the reef astern; the middle of the lagoon was\r\ngained; then, gradually, he neared the island-shore, but oh! it was a\r\nlong, weary pull, although the space was so short, and, to add to the\r\npoor man's misery, the fish which he had eaten caused him intolerable\r\nthirst.  But he reached the shore at last.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that greeted his eye as he landed was the sparkle of a\r\nclear spring at the foot of some cocoanut-trees.  He staggered eagerly\r\ntowards it, and fell down beside a hollow in the rock, like a large cup\r\nor bowl, which had been scooped out by it.\r\n\r\nWho shall presume to describe the feelings of that shipwrecked sailor as\r\nhe and his dog drank from the same cup at that sparkling crystal\r\nfountain?  Delicious odours of lime and citron trees, and well-nigh\r\nforgotten herbage, filled his nostrils, and the twitter of birds\r\nthrilled his ears, seeming to bid him welcome to the land, as he sank\r\ndown on the soft grass, and raised his eyes in thanksgiving to heaven.\r\nAn irresistible tendency to sleep then seized him.\r\n\r\n\"If there's a heaven upon earth, I'm in it now,\" he murmured, as he laid\r\ndown his head and closed his eyes.\r\n\r\nCuffy, nestling into his breast, placed his chin on his neck, and heaved\r\na deep, contented sigh.  This was the last sound the sailor recognised,\r\nas he sank into profound repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nISLAND LIFE.\r\n\r\nThere are few of the minor sweets of life more agreeable than to awake\r\nrefreshed, and to become gradually impressed with the conviction that\r\nyou are a perfectly free agent,--that you may rise when you choose, or\r\nlie still if you please, or do what you like, without let or hindrance.\r\n\r\nSo thought our hero, John Jarwin, when he awoke, on the same spot where\r\nhe had thrown himself down, after several hours of life-giving slumber.\r\nHe was still weak, but his weakness did not now oppress him.  The slight\r\nmeal, the long draught, and the deep sleep, had restored enough of\r\nvigour to his naturally robust frame to enable him, while lying on his\r\nback, to enjoy his existence once more.  He was, on first awaking, in\r\nthat happy condition of mind and body in which the former does not care\r\nto think and the latter does not wish to move--yet both are pleased to\r\nbe largely conscious of their own identity.\r\n\r\nThat he had not moved an inch since he lay down, became somewhat\r\napparent to Jarwin from the fact that Cuffy's chin still rested\r\nimmovable on his neck, but his mind was too indolent to pursue the\r\nthought.  He had not the most remote idea as to where he was, but he\r\ncared nothing for that.  He was in absolute ignorance of the time of\r\nday, but he cared, if possible, still less for that.  Food, he knew, was\r\nnecessary to his existence, but the thought gave him no anxiety.  In\r\nshort, John and his dog were in a state of quiescent felicity, and would\r\nprobably have remained so for some hours to come, had not the setting\r\nsun shone forth at that moment with a farewell gleam so intense, that it\r\nappeared to set the world of clouds overhead on fire, converting them\r\ninto hills and dales, and towering domes and walls and battlements of\r\nmolten glass and gold.  Even to the wearied seaman's sleepy vision the\r\nsplendour of the scene became so fascinating, that he shook off his\r\nlethargy, and raised himself on one elbow.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Cuffy!\" he exclaimed, to the yawning dog, \"seems to me that the\r\nheavens is a-fire!  Hope it won't come on dirty weather before you an' I\r\nget up somethin' in the shape o' a hut.  That minds me, doggie,\" he\r\nadded, glancing slowly round him, \"that we must look after prokoorin' of\r\nour supper.  I do believe we've bin an' slep away a whole day!  Well,\r\nwell, it don't much matter, seein' that we hain't got no dooty for to\r\ndo--no trick at the wheel, no greasin' the masts--wust of all, no\r\nsplicin' the main brace, and no grub.\"\r\n\r\nThis latter remark appeared to reach the understanding of the dog, for\r\nit uttered a melancholy howl as it gazed into its master's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Cuffy!\" continued the sailor with a sigh, \"you've good reason to\r\nyowl, for the half of a rotten fish ain't enough for a dog o' your\r\nappetite.  Come, let's see if we can't find somethin' more to our\r\ntastes.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this the man rose, stretched himself, yawned, looked helplessly\r\nround for a few seconds, and then, with a cheery \"Hallo!  Cuff, come\r\nalong, my hearty,\" went down to the beach in quest of food.\r\n\r\nIn this search he was not unsuccessful, for the beach abounded with\r\nshell-fish of various kinds; but Jarwin ate sparingly of these, having\r\nbeen impressed, in former years, by some stories which he had heard of\r\nshipwrecked sailors having been poisoned by shell-fish.  For the same\r\nreason he administered a moderate supply to Cuffy, telling him that \"it\r\nwarn't safe wittles, an' that if they was to be pisoned, it was as well\r\nto be pisoned in moderation.\"  The dog, however, did not appear to agree\r\nwith its master on this point, for it went picking up little tit-bits\r\nhere and there, and selfishly ignoring the \"share-and-share-alike\"\r\ncompact, until it became stuffed alarmingly, and could scarcely follow\r\nits master back to the fountain.\r\n\r\nArrived there, the two slaked their thirst together, and then Jarwin sat\r\ndown to enjoy a pipe, and Cuffy lay down to suffer the well-merited\r\nreward of gluttony.\r\n\r\nWe have said that Jarwin sat down to enjoy a pipe, but he did _not_\r\nenjoy it that night, for he discovered that the much-loved little\r\nimplement, which he had cherished tenderly while on the raft, was broken\r\nto atoms in his coat-pocket!  In his eagerness to drink on first\r\nlanding, he had thrown himself down on it, and now smoking was an\r\nimpossibility, at least for that night.  He reflected, however, that it\r\nwould not be difficult to make a wooden pipe, and that cigarettes might\r\nperhaps be made by means of leaves, or bark, while his tobacco lasted;\r\nso he consoled himself in the meantime with hopeful anticipations, and a\r\nquid.  Being still weak and weary, he lay down again beside the\r\nfountain, and almost immediately fell into a sleep, which was not at all\r\ndisturbed by the starts and groans and frequent yelps of Cuffy, whose\r\nsufferings could scarcely have been more severe if he had supped on\r\nturtle-soup and venison, washed down with port and claret.\r\n\r\nThus did those castaways spend the first night on their island.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that we are going to trace thus\r\nminutely every step and sensation in the career of our unfortunate\r\nfriends.  We have too much to tell that is important to devote our\r\n\"valuable space\" to everyday incidents.  Nevertheless, as it is\r\nimportant that our readers should understand our hero thoroughly, and\r\nthe circumstances in which we find him, it is necessary that we should\r\ndraw attention to some incidents--trifling in themselves, but important\r\nin their effects--which occurred to John Jarwin soon after his landing\r\non the island.\r\n\r\nThe first of these incidents was, that John one day slipped his foot on\r\na tangle-covered rock, and fell into the sea.  A small matter this, you\r\nwill say, to a man who could swim, and in a climate so warm that a dip,\r\nwith or without clothes, was a positive luxury.  Most true; and had the\r\nwetting been all, Jarwin would have had nothing to annoy him; for at the\r\ntime the accident occurred he had been a week on the island, had managed\r\nto pull and crack many cocoa-nuts, and had found various excellent\r\nwild-fruits, so that his strength, as well as Cuffy's, had been much\r\nrestored.  In fact, when Jarwin's head emerged from the brine, after his\r\ntumble, he gave vent to a shout of laughter, and continued to indulge in\r\nhilarious demonstrations all the time he was wringing the water out of\r\nhis garments, while the terrier barked wildly round him.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, in the very midst of a laugh, he became grave and pale,--\r\nso pale, that a more obtuse creature than Cuffy might have deemed him\r\nill.  While his mouth and eyes slowly opened wider and wider, his hands\r\nslapped his pockets, first his trousers, then his vest, then his coat,\r\nafter which they fell like pistol-shots on his thighs, and he exclaimed,\r\nin a voice of horror--\"Gone!\"\r\n\r\nAy, there could be no doubt about it; every particle of his tobacco was\r\ngone!  It had never been much, only three or four plugs; but it was\r\nstrong, and he had calculated that, what with careful husbanding, and\r\nmixing it with other herbs, it would last him for a considerable length\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nIn a state bordering on frenzy, the sailor rushed back to the rock from\r\nwhich he had fallen.  The \"baccy\" was not there.  He glanced right and\r\nleft--no sign of it floating on the sea.  In he went, head foremost,\r\nlike a determined suicide; down, down to the bottom, for he was an\r\nexpert diver, and rioted among the coral groves, and horrified the fish,\r\nuntil he well-nigh burst, and rose to the surface with a groan and\r\nsplutter that might have roused envy in a porpoise.  Then down he went\r\nagain, while Cuffy stood on the shore regarding him with mute amazement.\r\n\r\nNever did pearl-diver grope for the treasures of the deep with more\r\neager intensity than did John Jarwin search for that lost tobacco.  He\r\nremained under water until he became purple in the face, and, coming to\r\nthe surface after each dive, stayed only long enough to recharge his\r\nlungs with air.  How deeply he regretted at that time the fact that\r\nman's life depended on so frequent and regular a supply of atmospheric\r\nair!  How enviously he glanced at the fish which, with open eyes and\r\nmouths, appeared to regard him with inexpressible astonishment--as well\r\nthey might!  At last Jarwin's powers of endurance began to give way, and\r\nhe was compelled to return to the shore, to the great relief of Cuffy,\r\nwhich miserable dog, if it had possessed the smallest amount of\r\nreasoning power, must have deemed its master hopelessly insane.\r\n\r\n\"But why so much ado about a piece of tobacco?\" we hear some lady-reader\r\nor non-smoker exclaim.\r\n\r\nJust because our hero was, and had been since his childhood, an\r\ninveterate smoker.  Of course we cannot prove our opinion to be correct,\r\nbut we are inclined to believe that if all the smoke that had issued\r\nfrom Jarwin's lips, from the period of his commencing down to that\r\nterrible day when he lost his last plug, could have been collected in\r\none vast cloud, it would have been sufficient to have kept a factory\r\nchimney going for a month or six weeks.  The poor man knew his weakness.\r\nHe had several times tried to get rid of the habit which had enslaved\r\nhim, and, by failing, had come to know the tyrannical power of his\r\nmaster.  He had once been compelled by circumstances to forego his\r\nfavourite indulgence for three entire days, and retained so vivid a\r\nrecollection of his sufferings that he made up his mind never more to\r\nstrive for freedom, but to enjoy his pipe as long as he lived--to swim\r\nwith the current, in fact, and take it easy.  It was of no use that\r\nseveral men, who objected to smoking from principle, and had themselves\r\ngone through the struggle and come off victorious, pointed out that if\r\nhe went on at his present rate, it would cut short his life.  Jarwin\r\ndidn't believe _that_.  He _felt_ well and hearty, and said that he \"was\r\ntoo tough, by a long way, to be floored by baccy; besides, if his life\r\nwas to be short, he saw no reason why it should not be a pleasant one.\"\r\nIt was vain for these disagreeable men of principle to urge that when\r\nhis health began to give way he would not find life very pleasant, and\r\nthen \"baccy\" would fail to relieve him.  Stuff and nonsense?  Did not\r\nJarwin know that hundreds of thousands of _old_ men enjoyed their pipes\r\nto the very last.  He also knew that a great many men had filled early\r\ngraves owing to the use of tobacco, but he chose to shut his eyes to\r\nthis fact--moreover, although a great truth, it was a difficult truth to\r\nprove.\r\n\r\nIt was of still less use that those tiresome men of principle\r\ndemonstrated that the money spent in tobacco would, if accumulated, form\r\na snug little fortune to retire upon in his old age.  John only laughed\r\nat this.  \"Wot did he want with a fortin in his old age,\" he would say;\r\n\"he would rather work to the last for his three B's--his bread and beer\r\nand baccy--an' die in harness.  A man couldn't get on like a man without\r\nthem three B's, and he wosn't goin' for to deprive hisself of none of\r\n'em, not he; besides, his opponents were bad argifiers,\" he was wont to\r\nsay, with a chuckle, \"for if, as they said, baccy would be the means of\r\ncuttin' his life short, why then, he wouldn't never come to old age to\r\nuse his fortin, even if he _should_ manage to save it off his baccy.\"\r\n\r\nThis last argument always brought Jarwin off with flying colours--no\r\nwonder, for it was unanswerable; and thus he came to love his beer and\r\nbaccy so much that he became thoroughly enslaved to both.\r\n\r\nHis brief residence on the south-sea island had taught him, by painful\r\nexperience, that he _was_ capable of existing without at least two of\r\nhis three B's--bread and beer.  He had suffered somewhat from the change\r\nof diet; and now that his third B was thus suddenly, unexpectedly, and\r\nhopelessly wrenched from him, he sat himself down on the beach beside\r\nCuffy, and gazed out to sea in absolute despair.\r\n\r\nWe must guard the reader at this point from supposing that John Jarwin\r\nhad ever been what is called an intemperate man.  He was one of those\r\nhonest, straightforward tars who do their duty like men, and who,\r\nalthough extremely fond of their pipe and their glass of grog, never\r\nlower themselves below the level of the brutes by getting drunk.  At the\r\nsame time, we feel constrained to add that Jarwin acted entirely from\r\nimpulse and kindly feeling.  He had little to do with principle, and did\r\nnot draw towards those who professed to be thus guided.  He was wont to\r\nsay that they \"was troublesome fellers, always shovin' in their oars\r\nwhen they weren't wanted to, an' settin' themselves up for better than\r\neverybody else.\"  Had one of those troublesome fellows presented John\r\nJarwin with a pound of tobacco in his forlorn circumstances, at that\r\ntime he would probably have slapped him on the shoulder, and called him\r\none of the best fellows under the sun!\r\n\r\n\"Cuffy, my friend,\" exclaimed Jarwin at last, with an explosive sigh,\r\n\"all the baccy's gone, so we'll have to smoke sea-weed for the futur'.\"\r\nThe terrier said \"Bow-wow\" to this, cocked its ears, and looked earnest,\r\nas if waiting for more.\r\n\r\n\"Come along,\" exclaimed the man, overturning his dog as he leaped up,\r\n\"we'll go home and have summat to eat.\"\r\n\r\nJarwin had erected a rude hut, composed of boughs and turf, near the\r\nfountain where he had first landed.  It was the home to which he\r\nreferred.  At first he had devoted himself entirely to the erection of\r\nthis shelter, and to collecting various roots and fruits and shell-fish\r\nfor food, intending to delay the examination of the island until his\r\nstrength should be sufficiently restored to enable him to scale the\r\nheights without more than ordinary fatigue.  He had been so far\r\nrecruited as to have fixed for his expedition the day following that on\r\nwhich he sustained his irreparable loss.\r\n\r\nEntering his hut he proceeded to kindle a fire by means of a small\r\nburning-glass, with which, in happier times, he had been wont to light\r\nhis pipe.  Very soon he had several roots, resembling small potatoes,\r\nbaking in the hot ashes.  With these, a handful of plums, a dozen of\r\noyster-like fish, of which there were plenty on the shore, and a draught\r\nof clear cold water, he made a hearty repast, Cuffy coming in for a\r\nlarge share of it, as a matter of course.  Then he turned all his\r\npockets inside out, and examined them as carefully as if diamonds lurked\r\nin the seams.  No, not a speck of tobacco was to be found!  He smelt\r\nthem.  The odour was undoubtedly strong--very strong.  On the strength\r\nof it he shut his eyes, and endeavoured to think that he was smoking;\r\nbut it was a weak substitute for the pipe, and not at all satisfying.\r\nThereafter he sallied forth and wandered about the sea-shore in a\r\nmiserable condition, and went to bed that night--as he remarked to his\r\ndog--in the blues.\r\n\r\nReader, it is not possible to give you an adequate conception of the\r\nsensations and sufferings of John Jarwin on that first night of his\r\nbereaved condition.  He dreamed continuously of tobacco.  Now he was\r\npacing the deck of his old ship with a splendid pipe of cut Cavendish\r\nbetween his lips.  Anon he was smoking a meerschaum the size of a\r\nhogshead, with a stem equal to the length and thickness of the\r\nmain-topmast of a seventy-four; but somehow the meerschaum wouldn't\r\ndraw, whereupon John, in a passion, pronounced it worthy of its name,\r\nand hove it overboard, when it was instantly transformed into a shark\r\nwith a cutty pipe in its mouth.  To console himself our hero endeavoured\r\nto thrust into his mouth a quid of negro-head, which, however, suddenly\r\ngrew as big as the cabin-skylight, and became as tough as gutta-percha,\r\nso that it was utterly impossible to bite off a piece; and, stranger\r\nstill, when the poor sailor had by struggling got it in, it dwindled\r\ndown into a point so small that he could not feel it in his mouth at\r\nall.  On reaching this, the vanishing-point, Jarwin awoke to a\r\nconsciousness of the dread reality of his destitute condition.  Turning\r\non his other side with a deep groan, he fell asleep again, to dream of\r\ntobacco in some new and tantalising form until sunrise, when he awoke\r\nunrefreshed.  Leaping up, he cast off his clothes, rushed down the\r\nbeach, and plunged into sea, by way of relieving his feelings.\r\n\r\nDuring the day John Jarwin brooded much over his dreams, for his mind\r\nwas of a reflective turn, and Cuffy looked often inquiringly into his\r\nface.  That sympathetic doggie would evidently have besought him to pour\r\nhis sorrows into his cocked ears if he could have spoken; but--alas! for\r\npeople who are cast away on desert islands--the gift of speech has been\r\ndenied to dogs.\r\n\r\nBesides being moody, Jarwin was uncommonly taciturn that day.  He did\r\nnot tell Cuffy the result of his cogitations, so that we cannot say\r\nanything further about them.  All that we are certainly sure of is, that\r\nhe was profoundly miserable that day--that he postponed his intended\r\nexpedition to the top of the neighbouring hill--that he walked about the\r\nbeach slowly, with his chin on his breast and his hands in his pockets--\r\nthat he made various unsuccessful attempts to smoke dried leaves, and\r\nbark, and wild-flowers, mixing with those substances shreds of his\r\ntrousers' pockets, in order that they might have at least the flavour of\r\ntobacco--that he became more and more restive as the day wore on, became\r\nmore submissive in the evening, paid a few apologetic attentions to\r\nCuffy at supper-time, and, finally, went to bed in a better frame of\r\nmind, though still craving painfully for the weed which had enslaved\r\nhim.  That night his dreams were still of tobacco!  No lover was ever\r\nassailed more violently with dreams of his absent mistress than was John\r\nJarwin with longings for his adorable pipe.  But there was no hope for\r\nhim--the beloved one was effectually and permanently gone; so, like a\r\nsensible man, he awoke next morning with a stern resolve to submit to\r\nhis fate with a good grace.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this resolution he began the day with a cold bath, in\r\nwhich Cuffy joined him.  Then he breakfasted on chestnuts, plums,\r\ncitrons, oysters, and shrimps, the former of which abounded in the\r\nwoods, the latter on the shore.  Jarwin caught the shrimps in a net,\r\nextemporised out of his pocket-handkerchief.  While engaged with his\r\nmorning meal, he was earnestly watched by several green paroquets with\r\nblue heads and crimson breasts; and during pauses in the meal he\r\nobserved flocks of brightly-coloured doves and wood-pigeons, besides\r\nmany other kinds of birds, the names of which he did not know, as well\r\nas water-hens, plover, and wild ducks.\r\n\r\n\"Lost your appetite this morning, Cuff?\" said Jarwin, offering his\r\ncompanion a citron, which he decidedly refused.  \"Ah!\" he continued,\r\npatting the dog's sides, \"I see how it is; you've had breakfast already\r\nthis morning; bin at it when I was a-sleepin'.  For shame, Cuffy!--you\r\nshould have waited for me; an' you've bin an' over-ate yourself again,\r\nyou greedy dog!\"\r\n\r\nThis was evidently the case.  The guilty creature, forgetful of its past\r\nexperiences, had again gorged itself with dead fish, which it had found\r\non the beach, and looked miserable.\r\n\r\n\"Well, never mind, doggie,\" said Jarwin, finishing his meal, and rising.\r\n\"I'll give you a little exercise to-day for the good of your health.\r\nWe shan't go sulking as we did yesterday; so, come along.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailor left his bower as he spoke, and set off at a round pace with\r\nhis hands in his pockets, and a thick stick under his arm, whistling as\r\nhe went, while Cuffy followed lovingly at his heels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNINGS OF MAN AND BEAST.\r\n\r\nIt would appear to be almost an essential element in life that man\r\nshould indulge in speech.  Of course we cannot prove this, seeing that\r\nwe have never been cast alone on a desert island (although we _have_\r\nbeen next thing to it), and cannot positively conclude what would have\r\nbeen the consequences to our castaway if he had rigidly refrained from\r\nspeech.  All that we can ground an opinion on is the fact that John\r\nJarwin talked as much and as earnestly to his dog as if he knew that\r\nthat sagacious creature understood every word he uttered.  Indeed, he\r\ngot into such a habit of doing this, that it is very probable he might\r\nhave come to believe that Cuffy really did understand, though he was not\r\ngifted with the power to reply.  If it be true that Jarwin came to this\r\nstate of credulity, certain it is that Cuffy was deeply to blame in the\r\nmatter, because the way in which that ridiculous hypocrite sat before\r\nhis master, and looked up in his face with his lustrous, intelligent\r\neyes, and cocked his ears, and wagged his tail, and smiled, might have\r\ndeceived a much less superstitious man than a British tar.\r\n\r\nWe have said that Cuffy smiled, advisedly.  Some people might object to\r\nthe word, and say that he only \"snickered,\" or made faces.  That, we\r\nhold, is a controvertible question.  Cuffy's facial contortions looked\r\nlike smiling.  They came very often inappropriately, and during parts of\r\nJarwin's discourse when no smile should have been called forth; but if\r\nthat be sufficient to prove that Cuffy was not smiling, then, on the\r\nsame ground, we hold that a large proportion of those ebullitions which\r\nconvulse the human countenance are not smiles but unmeaning grins.  Be\r\nthis as it may, Cuffy smiled, snickered, or grinned amazingly, during\r\nthe long discourses that were delivered to him by his master, and indeed\r\nlooked so wonderfully human in his knowingness, that it only required a\r\nspeaking tongue and a shaved face to constitute him an unanswerable\r\nproof of the truth of the Darwinian theory of the origin of the human\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\"Cuffy,\" said Jarwin, panting, as he reached the summit of his island,\r\nand sat down on its pinnacle rock, \"that's a splendid view, ain't it?\"\r\n\r\nTo any one save a cynic or a misanthrope, Cuffy replied with eye and\r\ntail, \"It is magnificent.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're not looking at it,\" objected Jarwin, \"you're looking\r\nstraight up in my face; so how can you tell what it's like, doggie?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see it all,\" replied Cuffy with a grin; \"all reflected in the depths\r\nof your two loving eyes.\"\r\n\r\nOf course Jarwin lost this pretty speech in consequence of its being a\r\nmute reply, but he appeared to have some intuitive perception of it, for\r\nhe stooped down and patted the dog's head affectionately.\r\n\r\nAfter this there was a prolonged silence, during which the sailor gazed\r\nwistfully round the horizon.  The scene was indeed one of surpassing\r\nbeauty and grandeur.  The island on which he had been cast was one of\r\nthose small coral gems which deck the breast of the Pacific.  It could\r\nnot have been more than nine or ten miles in circumference, yet within\r\nthis area there lay a miniature world.  The mountain-top on which the\r\nseaman sat was probably eight or nine hundred feet above the level of\r\nthe sea, and commanded a view of the whole island.  On one side lay\r\nthree lesser hills, covered to their summits with indescribably rich\r\nverdure, amongst which rose conspicuous the tall stems and graceful\r\nfoliage of many cocoanut-palms.  Fruit-trees of various kinds glistened\r\nin the sunshine, and flowering shrubs in abundance lent additional\r\nsplendour to the scene.  On the other side of the mountain a small lake\r\nglittered like a jewel among the trees; and there numerous flocks of\r\nwild-fowl disported themselves in peaceful security.  From the farther\r\nextremity of the lake flowed a rivulet, which, from the mountain-top,\r\nresembled a silver thread winding its way through miniature valleys,\r\nuntil lost in the light yellow sand of the sea-shore.  On this beach\r\nthere was not even a ripple, because of the deep calm which prevailed\r\nbut on the ring or coral-reef, which completely encircled the island,\r\nthose great \"rollers\"--which appear never to go down even in calm--fell\r\nfrom time to time with a long, solemn roar, and left an outer ring of\r\nmilk-white foam.  The blue lagoon between the reef and the island varied\r\nfrom a few yards to a quarter of a mile in breadth, and its quiet waters\r\nwere like a sheet of glass, save where they were ruffled now and then by\r\nthe diving of a sea-gull or the fin of a shark.  Birds of many kinds\r\nfilled the grove with sweet sounds, and tended largely to dispel that\r\nfeeling of intense loneliness which had been creeping that day over our\r\nseaman's spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Come, my doggie,\" said Jarwin, patting his dumb companion's head, \"if\r\nyou and I are to dwell here for long, we've got a most splendid estate\r\nto look after.  I only hope we won't find South Sea niggers in\r\npossession before us, for they're not hospitable, Cuffy, they ain't\r\nhospitable, bein' given, so I'm told, to prefer human flesh to most\r\nother kinds o' wittles.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked anxiously round in all directions at this point, as if the\r\nideas suggested by his words were not particularly agreeable.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he resumed, after a short survey, \"it don't seem as if there was\r\nany of 'em here.  Anyhow I can't see none, and most parts of the island\r\nare visible from this here mast-head.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the seaman became silent as he repeated his survey of the island;\r\nhis hands, meanwhile, searching slowly, as if by instinct, round his\r\npockets, and into their most minute recesses, if haply they might find\r\nan atom of tobacco.  Both hands and eyes, however, failed in their\r\nsearch; so, turning once more towards his dog, Jarwin sat down and\r\naddressed it thus:--\r\n\r\n\"Cuff, my doggie, don't wink in that idiotical way, you hanimated bundle\r\nof oakum! and don't wag yer tail so hard, else you'll shake it off some\r\nfine day!  Well, Cuff, here you an' I are fixed--`it may be for years,\r\nan' it may be for ever'--as the old song says; so it behoves you and me\r\nto hold a consultation as to wot's the best to be done for to make the\r\nmost of our sukumstances.  Ah, doggie!\" he continued in a low tone,\r\nlooking pensively towards the horizon, \"it's little that my dear wife\r\n(your missus and mine, Cuff) knows that her John has fallen heir to\r\nsitch an estate; become, so to speak, `monarch of all he surveys.'  O\r\nMolly, Molly, if you was only here, wot a paradise it would be!  Eden\r\nover again; Adam an' Eve, without a'most no difference, barrin' the\r\nclo'se, by the way, for if I ain't mistaken, Adam didn't wear a straw\r\nhat and a blue jacket, with pumps and canvas ducks.  Leastwise, I've\r\nnever heard that he did; an' I'm quite sure that Eve didn't go to church\r\non Sundays in a gown wi' sleeves like two legs o' mutton, an' a bonnet\r\nlike a coal-scuttle.  By the way, I don't think they owned a doggie\r\nneither.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAt this point the terrier, who had gradually quieted down during the\r\nabove soliloquy, gave a responsive wag of its tail, and looked up with a\r\nsmile--a plain, obvious, unquestionable smile, which its master believed\r\nin most thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you needn't grin like that, Cuff,\" replied Jarwin, \"it's quite\r\ncertain that Adam and Eve had no doggie.  No doubt they had plenty of\r\nwild 'uns--them as they giv'd names to--but they hadn't a good little\r\ntame 'un like you, Cuff; no, nor nobody else, for you're the best dog in\r\nthe world--if you'd only keep yer spanker-boom quiet; but you'll shake\r\nit off, you will, if you go on like that.  There, lie down, an' let's\r\nget on with our consultation.  Well, as I was sayin' when you\r\ninterrupted me, wot a happy life we could live here if we'd only got the\r\nold girl with us!  I'd be king, you know, Cuff, and she'd be queen, and\r\nwe'd make you prime minister--you're prime favourite already, you know.\r\nThere now, if you don't clap a stopper on that ere spanker-boom, I'll\r\nhave to lash it down.  Well, to proceed: we'd build a hut--or a palace--\r\nof turf an' sticks, with a bunk alongside for you; an w'en our clo'se\r\nbegan for to wear out, we'd make pants and jackets and petticoats of\r\ncocoanut-fibre; for you must know I've often see'd mats made o' that\r\nstuff, an' splendid wear there's in it too, though it would be rather\r\nrough for the skin at first; but we'd get used to that in coorse o'\r\ntime.  Only fancy Mrs Jarwin in a cocoanut-fibre petticoat with a\r\npalm-leaf hat, or somethink o' that sort!  An', after all, it wouldn't\r\nbe half so rediklous as some o' the canvas she's used to spread on\r\nSundays.\"\r\n\r\nJarwin evidently thought his ideas somewhat ridiculous, for he paused at\r\nthis point and chuckled, while Cuffy sprang up and barked responsively.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus engaged, a gleam of white appeared on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\"Sail ho!\" shouted the sailor in the loud, full tones with which he was\r\nwont to announce such an appearance from the mast-head in days gone by.\r\n\r\nOh, how earnestly he strained his eyes in the direction of that little\r\nspeck!  It might have been a sail; just as likely it was the wing of a\r\nsea-gull or an albatross.  Whatever it was, it grew gradually less until\r\nit sank out of view on the distant horizon.  With it sank poor Jarwin's\r\nnewly-raised hopes.  Still he continued to gaze intently, in the hope\r\nthat it might reappear; but it did not.  With a heavy sigh the sailor\r\nrose at length, wakened Cuffy, who had gone to sleep, and descended the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nThis look-out on the summit of the island now became the regular place\r\nof resort for Jarwin and his dumb, but invaluable companion.  And so\r\nabsorbed did the castaway become, in his contemplation of the horizon,\r\nand in his expectation of the heaving in sight of another sail, that he\r\nsoon came to spend most of his time there.  He barely gave himself time\r\nto cook and eat his breakfast before setting out for the spot, and\r\nfrequently he remained there the livelong day, having carried up enough\r\nof provision to satisfy his hunger.\r\n\r\nAt first, while there, he employed himself in the erection of a rude\r\nflag-staff, and thus kept himself busy and reasonably cheerful.  He cut\r\nthe pole with some difficulty, his clasp-knife being but a poor\r\nsubstitute for an axe; then he bored a hole at the top to reave the\r\nhalliards through.  These latter he easily made by plaiting together\r\nthreads of cocoanut-fibre, which were both tough and long.  When ready,\r\nhe set up and fixed the staff, and hoisted thereon several huge leaves\r\nof the palm-tree, which, in their natural size and shape, formed\r\nexcellent flags.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, all this was done, he was reduced to a state of idleness,\r\nand his mind began to dwell morbidly on the idea of being left to spend\r\nthe rest of his days on the island.  His converse with Cuffy became so\r\nsad that the spirits of that sagacious and sympathetic dog were visibly\r\naffected.  He did, indeed, continue to lick his master's hand lovingly,\r\nand to creep close to his side on all occasions; but he ceased to wag\r\nhis expressive tail with the violence that used to characterise that\r\nappendage in other days, and became less demonstrative in his conduct.\r\nAll this, coupled with constant exposure in all sorts of weather--\r\nalthough Jarwin was not easily affected by a breeze or a wet jacket--\r\nbegan at last to undermine the health of the stout seaman.  He became\r\nsomewhat gaunt and hollow-cheeked, and his beard and moustache, which of\r\ncourse he could not shave, and which, for a long time, presented the\r\nappearance of stubble, added to the lugubriosity of his aspect.\r\n\r\nAs a climax to his distress, he one day lost his dog!  When it went off,\r\nor where it went to, he could not tell, but, on rousing up one morning\r\nand putting out his hand almost mechanically to give it the accustomed\r\npat of salutation, he found that it was gone.\r\n\r\nA thrill of alarm passed through his frame on making this discovery,\r\nand, leaping up, he began to shout its name.  But no answering bark was\r\nheard.  Again and again he shouted, but in vain.  Without taking time to\r\nput on his coat, he ran to the top of the nearest eminence, and again\r\nshouted loud and long.  Still no answer.\r\n\r\nA feeling of desperate anxiety now took possession of the man.  The bare\r\nidea of being left in utter loneliness drove him almost distracted.  For\r\nsome time he ran hither and thither, calling passionately to his dog,\r\nuntil he became quite exhausted; then he sat down on a rock, and\r\nendeavoured to calm his spirit and consider what he should do.\r\nIndulging in his tendency to think aloud, he said--\r\n\r\n\"Come now, John, don't go for to make a downright fool of yerself.\r\nCuffy has only taken a longer walk than usual.  He'll be home to\r\nbreakfast; but you may as well look a bit longer, there's no sayin' wot\r\nmay have happened.  He may have felled over a precepiece or sprain'd his\r\nleg.  Don't you give way to despair anyhow, John Jarwin, but nail yer\r\ncolours to the mast, and never say die.\"\r\n\r\nSomewhat calmed by these encouraging exhortations, the sailor rose up\r\nand resumed his search in a more methodical way.  Going down to the sea,\r\nhe walked thence up to the edge of the bush, gazing with the utmost\r\nintensity at the ground all the way, in the hope of discovering Cuffy's\r\nfresh footsteps; but none were to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said he, \"it's clear that you haven't gone to the s'uth'ard o'\r\nyer home; now, we'll have a look to the nor'ard.\"\r\n\r\nHere he was more successful.  The prints of Cuffy's small paws were\r\ndiscovered on the wet sand bearing northward along shore.  Jarwin\r\nfollowed them up eagerly, but, coming to a place where the sand was hard\r\nand dry, and covered with thin grass, he lost them.  Turning back to\r\nwhere they were distinct, he recommenced the search.  No red Indian, in\r\npursuit of friend or foe, ever followed up a trail with more intense\r\neagerness than poor Jarwin followed the track of his lost companion.  He\r\neven began to develop, in quite a surprising way, some of the deep\r\nsagacity of the savage; for he came, before that day was over, not only\r\nto distinguish the prints of Cuffy's paws on pretty hard sand, where the\r\nimpressions were very faint, but even on rough ground, where there were\r\nno distinct marks at all--only such indications as were afforded by the\r\npressure of a dead leaf into soft ground, or the breaking of a fallen\r\ntwig!\r\n\r\nNevertheless, despite his care, anxiety, and diligence, Jarwin failed to\r\nfind his dog.  He roamed all that day until his limbs were weary, and\r\nshouted till his voice was hoarse, but only echoes answered him.  At\r\nlast he sat down, overcome with fatigue and grief.\r\n\r\nIt had rained heavily during the latter part of the day and soaked him\r\nto the skin, but he heeded it not.  Towards evening the weather cleared\r\nup little, but the sun descended to the horizon in a mass of black\r\nclouds, which were gilded with [a] strange lurid light that presaged a\r\nstorm; while sea-birds flew overhead and shrieked in wild excitement, as\r\nif they were alarmed at the prospect before them.  But Jarwin observed\r\nand cared for none of these things.  He buried his face in his hands,\r\nand sat for some time perfectly motionless.\r\n\r\nWhile seated thus, a cold shiver passed through his frame once or twice,\r\nand he felt unusually faint.\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" said he, the second time this occurred, \"strange sort o'\r\nfeelin'.  Never felt it before.  No doubt it's in consikince o' goin'\r\nwithout wittles all day.  Well, well,\" he added, with a deep long-drawn\r\nsigh, \"who'd have thought I'd lose 'ee, Cuff, in this fashion.  It's\r\nfoolish, no doubt, to take on like this, but I can't help it somehow.  I\r\ndon't believe I could feel much worse if I had lost my old 'ooman.  It's\r\nkurious, but I feels awful lonesome without 'ee, my doggie.\"\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by the shivering again, and was about to rise, when a\r\nlong low wail struck on his ear.  He listened intently.  No statue ever\r\nsat more motionless on its pedestal than did Jarwin during the next\r\nthree minutes.\r\n\r\nAgain the wail rose, faint and low at first, then swelling out into a\r\nprolonged loud cry, which, strange to say, seemed to be both distant and\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nJohn Jarwin was not altogether free from superstition.  His heart beat\r\nhard under the influence of a mingled feeling of hope and fear; but when\r\nhe heard the cry the third time, he dismissed his fears, and, leaping\r\nup, hurried forward in the direction whence the sound appeared to come.\r\nThe bushes were thick and difficult to penetrate, but he persevered on\r\nhearing a repetition of the wail, and was thus led into a part of the\r\nisland which he had not formerly visited.\r\n\r\nPresently he came to something that appeared not unlike an old track;\r\nbut, although the sun had not quite set, the place was so shut in by\r\ntangled bushes and trees that he could see nothing distinctly.  Suddenly\r\nhe put his right foot on a mass of twigs, which gave way under his\r\nweight, and he made a frantic effort to recover himself.  Next moment,\r\nhe fell headlong into a deep hole or pit at the bottom of which he lay\r\nstunned for some time.  Recovering, he found that no bones were broken,\r\nand after considerable difficulty, succeeded in scrambling out of the\r\nhole.  Just as he did so, the wail was again raised; but it sounded so\r\nstrange, and so unlike any sound that Cuffy could produce, that he was\r\ntempted to give up the search--all the more that his recent fall had so\r\nshaken his exhausted frame that he could scarcely walk.\r\n\r\nWhile he stood irresolute, the wail was repeated, and, this time, there\r\nwas a melancholy sort of \"bow-wow\" mingled with it, that sent the blood\r\ncareering through his veins like wildfire.  Fatigue and hunger were\r\nforgotten.  Shouting the name of his dog, he bounded forward, and would\r\ninfallibly have plunged head-foremost into another pit, at the bottom of\r\nwhich Cuffy lay, had not that wise creature uttered a sudden bark of\r\njoy, which checked his master on the very brink.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!  _Cuff_, is that you, my doggie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bow, wow, _wow_!\" exclaimed Cuffy in tones which there could be no\r\nmistaking, although the broken twigs and herbage which covered the mouth\r\nof the pit muffled them a good deal, and accounted for the strangeness\r\nof the creature's howls when heard at a distance.\r\n\r\n\"Why, where ever have 'ee got yourself into?\" said Jarwin, going down on\r\nhis knees and groping carefully about the opening of the pit.  \"I do\r\nbelieve you've bin an' got into a trap o' some sort.  The savages must\r\nhave been here before us, doggie, and made more than one of 'em, for\r\nI've just comed out o' one myself.  Hallo! _there_, I'm into another!\"\r\nhe exclaimed as the treacherous bank gave way, and he slipped in\r\nheadlong, with a dire crash, almost smothering Cuffy in his fall.\r\n\r\nFortunately, no damage, beyond a few scratches, resulted either to dog\r\nor man, and in a few minutes more both stood upon firm ground.\r\n\r\nIt would be vain, reader to attempt to give you in detail all that John\r\nJarwin said and did on that great occasion, as he sat there on the\r\nground caressing his dog as if it had been his own child.  We leave it\r\nto your imagination!\r\n\r\nWhen he had expended the first burst of feeling, he got up, and was\r\nabout to retrace his steps, when he observed some bones lying near him.\r\nOn examination, these proved to be the skeleton of a man.  At first\r\nJarwin thought it must be that of a native; but he was startled to find\r\namong the dust on which the skeleton lay several brass buttons with\r\nanchors on them.  That he stood beside the remains of a brother seaman,\r\nwho had probably been cast on that island, as he himself had been,\r\nseemed very evident, and the thought filled him with strange depressing\r\nemotions.  As it was by that time too dark to make further\r\ninvestigations, he left the place, intending to return next day; and,\r\ngoing as cautiously as possible out of the wood, returned to his abode,\r\nwhere he kindled a fire, gave Cuffy some food, and prepared some for\r\nhimself; but before he had tasted that food another of the shivering\r\nfits seized him.  A strange feeling of being very ill, and a peculiar\r\nwandering of his mind, induced him to throw himself on his couch.  The\r\nprolonged strain to which body and mind had been subjected had proved\r\ntoo much for him, and before morning he was stricken with a raging\r\nfever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nHOPES AND FEARS AND STERN RESOLVES LEAD TO VIGOROUS ACTION.\r\n\r\nFor several days the sailor lay tossing in helpless misery in his bower,\r\nwithout food or fire.  Indeed he could not have eaten even if food had\r\nbeen offered him, and as to fire, there was heat enough in his veins,\r\npoor fellow! to more than counterbalance the want of that.\r\n\r\nDuring part of the time he became delirious, and raved about home and\r\nsea-life and old companions in a way that evidently quite alarmed Cuffy,\r\nfor that sagacious terrier approached his master with caution, with his\r\ntail between his legs, and a pitiful, earnest gaze, that was quite\r\ntouching.  This was partly owing to the fact that Jarwin had several\r\ntimes patted him with such painful violence as to astonish and render\r\nhim doubtful of the affection displayed by such caresses.  Jarwin also\r\nrecurred at these times to his tobacco and beer, and apparently suffered\r\na good deal from dreams about those luxuries.  In his ravings he often\r\ntold Cuffy to fill a pipe for him, and advised him to look sharp about\r\nit, and he frequently reproached some of his old comrades for not\r\npassing the beer.  Fortunately the fountain was close at hand, and he\r\noften slaked his burning thirst at it.  He also thought frequently of\r\nthe skeleton in the thicket, and sometimes raved with an expression of\r\nhorror about being left to die alone on a desert island.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the fever reached its climax, and then left him almost dead.\r\nFor a whole day and night he lay so absolutely helpless that it cost him\r\nan effort to open his eyes, and he looked so ill that the poor dog began\r\nto whine piteously over him, but the day after that a sensation of\r\nhunger induced him to make an effort to rouse up.  He tried to raise his\r\nhead--it felt as if made of lead.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!  Cuffy, somethin' wrong I suspect!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first time for many days that Jarwin had spoken in his\r\nnatural tones.  The effect on the dog was instantaneous and powerful.\r\nIt sprang up, and wagged its expressive tail with something of the\r\nenergy of former times; licked the sick man's face and hands; whined and\r\nbarked intelligently; ran away in little bursts, as if it had resolved\r\nto undertake a journey off-hand, but came back in a few seconds, and in\r\nmany other ways indicated its intense delight at finding that Jarwin was\r\n\"himself again.\"\r\n\r\nBut alas!  Jarwin was not quite himself yet, and Cuffy, after his first\r\nebullition, sat looking in surprise at the invalid, as he strove to turn\r\non his side, and reach out his heavy hand and skinny arm towards a few\r\nscraps of the last meal he had cooked before being struck down.  Cuffy,\r\nafter eating the portion of that meal that suited his taste, had left\r\nthe remnants there as being unworthy of notice, and catered for himself\r\namong the dead fish cast up on the beach.  Although lying within a yard\r\nof his couch, Jarwin had the greatest difficulty in reaching the food;\r\nand when he did at length succeed in grasping it, he fell back on his\r\ncouch, and lay for a long time as if dead.  Soon, however, he recovered,\r\nand, with a feeling of gratitude such as he had never before\r\nexperienced, began to gnaw the hard morsels.\r\n\r\n\"I'm in a bad way, Cuff,\" he said, after satisfying the first cravings\r\nof hunger.\r\n\r\nCuffy gave a responsive wag with his tail, and cocked his ears for more.\r\n\r\n\"Hows'ever, seems to me that I've got the turn; let's be thankful for\r\n_that_, my doggie.  Wonder how long I've bin ill.  Months mayhap.  Don't\r\nthink I could have come to be sitch a skeleton in a short time.  Ha!\r\nthat minds me o' the skeleton in the wood.  Have 'ee seed it, Cuff,\r\nsince I found 'ee there?  Well, I must eat and drink too, if I would\r\nkeep the skin on _my_ skeleton.  Wish you had hands, doggie, for I'm\r\ngreatly in need o' help just now.  But you're a comfort, anyhow, even\r\nthough you hain't got no hands.  I should have died without you, my\r\ndoggie--you cheer me up, d'ee see, and when it's nigh low water with a\r\nman, it don't take much to make him slip his cable.  The want of a kind\r\nlook at this here time, Cuffy, would have sent me adrift, I do believe.\"\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that all this was spoken fluently.  It came\r\nslowly, by fits and starts, with a long pause at the end of each\r\nsentence, and with many a sigh between, expressive of extreme weakness.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I had a drink, Cuffy,\" said the invalid after a long pause,\r\nturning a longing look towards the spring, which welled up pleasantly\r\nclose to the opening of the hut.  \"Ay, that's all very well in its way,\r\nbut bow-wowin' an' waggin' yer tail won't fetch me a can o' water.\r\nHows'ever, it's o' no manner o' use wishin'.  `Never say die.'  Here\r\ngoes.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he began slowly and painfully, but with unyielding\r\nperseverance, to push, and draw, and hitch himself, while lying at full\r\nlength, towards the spring, which he reached at last so exhausted, that\r\nhe had barely put his lips to it and swallowed a mouthful, when his head\r\ndropped, and he almost fainted.  He was within an ace of being drowned,\r\nbut with a violent effort he drew his face out of the spring, and lay\r\nthere in a half unconscious condition for some time, with the clear cool\r\nwater playing about his temples.  Reviving in a little time, he took\r\nanother sip, and then crawled back to his couch.  Immediately he fell\r\ninto a profound slumber, from which Cuffy strove in vain to awaken him;\r\ntherefore, like a sagacious dog, he lay down at his master's side and\r\njoined him in repose.\r\n\r\nFrom that hour Jarwin began to mend rapidly.  In a few days he was able\r\nto walk about with the aid of a stick.  In a few weeks he felt somewhat\r\nlike his former self, and soon after that, he was able to ascend to the\r\ntop of the island, and resume his watch for a passing sail.  But the\r\nfirst few hours of his watch beside the old flagstaff convinced him that\r\nhis hopes would, in all probability, be doomed to disappointment, and\r\nthat he would soon fall back into a state of apathy, from which he might\r\nperhaps be unable to rouse himself, in which case his fate would\r\ncertainly be that of the poor sailor whose remains he had that day\r\nburied in the pit near to which they had been discovered.  He resolved,\r\ntherefore, to give up watching altogether, and to devote all his\r\nenergies in future to devising some plan of escape from the island, but\r\nwhen he bent his mind to this task he felt a deep sinking of the heart,\r\nfor he had no implements wherewith to construct a boat or canoe.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it occurred to him, for the first time in his life, that he\r\nought, in this extremity, to pray to God for help.  He was, as we have\r\nsaid, a straightforward man, prompt to act as well as ready to conceive.\r\nHe fell on his knees at once, humbly confessed his sin in depending so\r\nentirely on himself in time past, and earnestly asked help and guidance\r\nfor the future.  His prayer was not long--neither was the publican's--\r\nbut it was effectual.  He arose with feelings of strong resolution and\r\nconfidence, which appeared to himself quite unaccountable, for he had\r\nnot, as yet, conceived any new idea or method as to escaping from the\r\nisland.  Instead of setting his mind to work, as he had intended, he\r\ncould not help dwelling on the fact that he had never before\r\ndeliberately asked help from his Maker, and this raised a train of\r\nself-condemnatory thoughts which occupied him the remainder of that day.\r\nAt night he prayed again before laying down to rest.\r\n\r\nNext morning he rose like a giant refreshed, and, after a plunge in the\r\nsea and a hearty breakfast, set out with Cuffy for a meditative walk.\r\n\r\nGreat were the thoughts that swelled the seaman's broad chest during\r\nthat walk, and numerous, as well as wild and quaint, were the plans of\r\nescape which he conceived and found it necessary to abandon.\r\n\r\n\"It's harder work to think it out than I had expected, Cuffy,\" he said,\r\nsitting down on a cliff that overlooked the sea, and thinking aloud.\r\n\"If you and I could only swim twenty miles or so at a stretch, I'd risk\r\nit; but, as nothin' short o' that would be likely to be of sarvice, we\r\nmust give it up.  Then, if I could only cut down trees with my shoe, and\r\nsaw planks with my jacket, we might make a boat; but I can't do that,\r\nand we haven't no nails--except our toe-nails, which ain't the right\r\nshape or strong enough; so we must give that up too.  It's true that we\r\nmight burn a canoe out of a solid tree, but who's to cut down the solid\r\ntree for us, doggie?  I'm sure if the waggin' of a tail could do it you\r\nwouldn't be long about it!  Why on earth can't 'ee keep it still for a\r\nbit?  Well, then, as we can't swim or fly, and haven't a boat or canoe,\r\nor the means o' makin' em, what's the next thing to be done?\"\r\n\r\nApparently neither man nor dog could return an answer to that question,\r\nfor they both sat for a very long time in profound silence, staring at\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nAfter some time Jarwin suddenly exclaimed, \"I'll do it!\"\r\n\r\nCuffy, startled by the energy with which it was said, jumped up and\r\nsaid, \"That's right!\"--or something very like it--with his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Cuffy, I'll make a raft, and you and I shall get on it, some day,\r\nwith a fair wind, and make for the island that we think we've seen so\r\noften on the horizon.\"\r\n\r\nHe alluded here to a faint blue line which, on unusually fine and clear\r\ndays, he had distinguished on the horizon to the southward, and which,\r\nfrom its always appearing on the same spot, he believed to be land of\r\nsome sort, although it looked nothing more than a low-lying cloud.\r\n\r\n\"So that's settled,\" continued Jarwin, getting up and walking smartly\r\nback to his hut with the air of a man who has a purpose in view.  \"We\r\nshall make use of the old raft, as far as it'll go.  Luckily the sail is\r\nleft, as you and I know, Cuff, for it has been our blanket for many a\r\nday, and when all's ready we shall go huntin', you and I, till we've got\r\ntogether a stock of provisions, and then--up anchor and away!  We can\r\nonly be drownded once, you know, and it's better that than stopping here\r\nto die o' the blues.  What think 'ee o' that, my doggie?\"\r\n\r\nWhatever the doggie thought of the idea, there can be no question what\r\nhe thought of the cheery vigorous tones of his master's voice, for he\r\ngambolled wildly round, barked with vociferous delight, and wagged his\r\n\"spanker boom\" to such an extent that Jarwin warned him to have a care\r\nlest it should be carried away, an' go slap overboard.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the designs thus expressed, the sailor began the\r\nconstruction of a raft without delay, and worked at it diligently the\r\nremainder of that day.  He found, on examination, that a considerable\r\nportion of the old raft yet remained stranded on the beach, though all\r\nthe smaller spars of which it had been composed had been used for\r\nfirewood.  With great difficulty he rolled these logs one by one into\r\nthe sea, and, getting astride of each, pushed them by means of a pole\r\ntowards a point of rocks, or natural jetty, alongside of which the water\r\nwas deep.  Here he fastened them together by means of a piece of rope--\r\none of the old fastenings which remained to him, the others having been\r\nused in the construction of the hut.  The raft thus formed was, however,\r\nmuch too small to weather a gale or float in a rough sea.  In whatever\r\nway he placed the spars the structure was too narrow for safety.\r\nSeeing, therefore, that it was absolutely necessary to obtain more logs,\r\nhe set brain and hands to work without delay.\r\n\r\nMany years before, he had seen an ancient stone hatchet in a museum, the\r\nhead of which was fastened to the haft by means of a powerful thong of\r\nuntanned hide.  He resolved to make a hatchet of this sort.  Long did he\r\nsearch the beach for a suitable stone, but in vain.  At last he found\r\none pretty nearly the proper shape, which he chipped and ground into the\r\nrude form of an axe.  It had no eye for the handle.  To have made a hole\r\nin it would have weakened the stone too much.  He therefore cut a groove\r\nin the side of the handle, placed the head of the stone into it, and\r\ncompleted the fastening by tying it firmly with the tough fibrous roots\r\nof a tree.  It was strongly and neatly made, though clumsy in\r\nappearance, but, do what he would, he could not put a sufficiently fine\r\nedge on it, and although it chipped pretty well when applied to the\r\noutside of a tree, it made very slow progress indeed as the cut\r\ndeepened, and the work became so toilsome at last that he almost gave it\r\nup in despair.  Suddenly it occurred to him that fire might be made use\r\nof to facilitate the work.  Selecting a tall cocoanut-tree, he piled dry\r\nwood all round the foot of it.  Before setting it on fire he dipped a\r\nquantity of cocoanut fibre in the sea and tied a thick belt of this\r\nround the tree just above the pile, so as to protect the upper parts of\r\nthe spar from the flames as much and as long as possible.  This done, he\r\nkindled the pile.  A steady breeze fanned the flame into an intense\r\nfire, which ere long dried up the belt of fibre and finally consumed it.\r\nThe fire was pretty well burnt out by that time, however, so that the\r\nupper part of the stem had been effectually preserved.  Removing the\r\nashes, he was rejoiced to find that the foot of the tree had been so\r\ndeeply burned that several inches of it were reduced to charcoal, which\r\nhis stone hatchet readily cut away, and the operation was so successful\r\nthat it only required a second fire to enable him to fell the tree.\r\n\r\nThis done, he measured it off in lengths.  Under each point of\r\nmeasurement he piled up dry wood--which consisted merely of broken\r\nbranches--with belts of wet fibre on each side of these piles.  Then,\r\napplying a light to the fires he reduced the parts to charcoal as\r\nbefore, and completed the work with the hatchet.  Thus, in the course of\r\na single day, he felled a tall tree and cut it up into six lengths,\r\nwhich he rolled down to the sea and floated off to the end of the jetty.\r\n\r\nNext day Jarwin rose with the sun, and began to make twine of twisted\r\ncocoanut fibre--of which there was great abundance to be had everywhere.\r\nWhen a sufficient quantity had been made he plaited the twine into\r\ncords, and the cords into stout ropes, which, although not so neat as\r\nregular ropes, were, nevertheless, sufficiently pliable and very strong.\r\nSeveral days were spent over this somewhat tedious process; and we may\r\nmention here, that in all these operations the busy seaman was greatly\r\nassisted by his dog, who stuck close to him all the time, encouraging\r\nhim with looks and wags of approbation.\r\n\r\nAfter the ropes were made, the raft was put together and firmly lashed.\r\nThere was a mast and yard in the centre of it, and also a hollow, formed\r\nby the omission of a log, which was just large enough to permit of the\r\nman and his dog lying down.  This hollow, slight though it was,\r\nafterwards proved of the utmost service.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to recount all the details of the building and\r\nprovisioning of this raft.  Suffice it to say that, about three weeks\r\nafter the idea of it had been conceived, it was completed and ready for\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence on the island, although it had only extended over a\r\nfew months, Jarwin had become very expert in the use of a sharp-pointed\r\npole, or javelin, with which he had become quite an adept in spearing\r\nfish.  He had also become such a dead-shot with a stone that when he\r\nmanaged to get within thirty yards of a bird, he was almost certain to\r\nhit it.  Thus he was enabled to procure fish and fowl as much as he\r\nrequired and as the woods abounded with cocoa-nuts, plums, and other\r\nwild fruits, besides many edible roots, he had no lack of good fare.\r\nNow that he was about to \"go to sea,\" he bethought him of drying some of\r\nthe fruits as well as curing some fish and birds.  This he did by\r\ndegrees, while engaged on the raft, so that when all was ready he had a\r\nstore of provisions sufficient to last him several weeks.  In order to\r\nstow all this he removed another log from the middle of the raft, and,\r\nhaving deposited the food in the hollow--carefully wrapped in cocoanut\r\nleaves and made into compact bundles--he covered it over by laying a\r\nlayer of large leaves above it and lashing a small spar on the top of\r\nthem to keep them down.  The cask with which he had landed from the\r\noriginal raft, and which he had preserved with great care, not knowing\r\nhow soon he might be in circumstances to require it, served to hold\r\nfresh water.\r\n\r\nOn a fine morning about sunrise, Jarwin embarked with his little dog and\r\nbade farewell to the coral island, and although he had not dwelt very\r\nlong there, he felt, to his own surprise, much regret at quitting it.\r\n\r\nA fresh breeze was blowing in the direction of the island--or the\r\nsupposed island--he wished to reach.  This was important, because, in\r\nsuch a craft, it was impossible to sail in any way except before the\r\nwind.  Still, by means of a rude oar or paddle, he could modify its\r\ndirection so as to steer clear of the passage through the reef and get\r\nout to sea.\r\n\r\nOnce outside, he squared the sail and ran right before the breeze.  Of\r\ncourse such a weighty craft went very slowly through the water, but the\r\nwind was pretty strong, and to Jarwin, who had been for a comparatively\r\nlong time unaccustomed to moving on the water, the speed seemed fast\r\nenough.  As the island went astern, and the raft lifted and fell gently\r\non the long swell of the ocean, the seaman's heart beat with a peculiar\r\njoy to which it had long been a stranger, and he thanked God fervently\r\nfor having so soon answered his prayer.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he sat reclining in the hollow of the raft, resting his\r\nhand lightly on the steering oar and gazing in silence at the gradually\r\nfading woods of his late home.  The dog, as if it were aware that a\r\ngreat change was being effected in their destiny, lay also perfectly\r\nstill--and apparently contemplative--at his master's feet; resting his\r\nchin on a log and gazing at the receding land.  It was evident, however,\r\nthat _his_ thoughts were not absent or wandering, for, on the slightest\r\nmotion made by his master, his dark eyes turned towards him, his ears\r\nslightly rose, and his tail gave the faintest possible indication of an\r\nintention to wag.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Cuffy,\" said Jarwin at last, rousing himself with a sigh, \"wot\r\nare 'ee thinking of?\"\r\n\r\nThe dog instantly rose, made affectionate demonstrations, and whined.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you may well say that, Cuff,\" replied the man; \"I know you ain't\r\neasy in yer mind, and there's some reason in that, too, for we're off on\r\na raither uncertain viage, in a somewhat unseaworthy craft.  Howsever,\r\ncheer up, doggie.  Whoever turns up, you and I shall sink or swim\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\nJust then the sail flapped.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!  Cuff,\" exclaimed Jarwin, with a look of anxiety, \"the wind's\r\ngoing to shift.\"\r\n\r\nThis was true.  The wind did shift, and in a few minutes had veered so\r\nmuch round that the raft was carried away from the blue line on the\r\nhorizon, which Jarwin had so fondly hoped would turn out to be an\r\ninhabited island.  It blew lightly, however, and when the sun went down,\r\nhad completely died away.  In these circumstances Jarwin and his dog\r\nsupped together, and then lay down to rest, full of sanguine hope.\r\n\r\nThey were awakened during the night by a violent squall, which, however,\r\ndid no further damage than wash a little spray over them, for Jarwin had\r\ntaken the precaution to lower and make fast the sail.  He now turned his\r\nattention to preparing the raft for rough weather.  This consisted in\r\nsimply drawing over the hollow--in which he, his dog, and his provisions\r\nlay--a piece of canvas that he had cut off the sail, which was\r\nunnecessarily large.  It served as a tarpaulin, and effectually shielded\r\nthem from ordinary sprays, but when the breeze freshened to a gale, and\r\ngreen seas swept over the _raft_, it leaked so badly, that Jarwin's\r\ncabin became a salt-water bath, and his provisions by degrees were\r\nsoaked.\r\n\r\nAt first he did not mind this much, for the air and water were\r\nsufficiently warm, but after being wet for several hours he began feel\r\nchilled.  As for poor Cuffy, his trembling body bore testimony to the\r\nstate of his feelings; nevertheless he did not complain, being a dog of\r\nhigh spirit and endurance.  In these circumstances the seaman hailed the\r\nrising sun with great joy, even although it rose in the midst of lurid\r\nmurky clouds, and very soon hid its face altogether behind them, as if\r\nit had made up its mind that the state of things below was so bad as to\r\nbe not worth shining upon.\r\n\r\nAll that day and night the gale continued, and they were driven before\r\nit.  The waves rushed so continuously and furiously over the raft, that\r\nit was with the utmost difficulty Jarwin could retain his position on\r\nit.  Indeed it would have been impossible for him to have done so, if he\r\nhad not taken the precaution of making the hollow in the centre, into\r\nwhich he could crouch, and thus avoid the full force of the seas.  Next\r\nday the wind abated a little, but the sea still rolled \"mountains high.\"\r\nIn order to break their force a little, he ventured to show a little\r\ncorner of the sail.  Small though it was, it almost carried away the\r\nslender mast, and drove the raft along at a wonderfully rapid rate.\r\n\r\nAt last the gale went down, and, finally, it became a dead calm, leaving\r\nthe raft like a cork heaving on the mighty swell of the Pacific Ocean.\r\nWeary and worn--almost dead with watching and exposure--John Jarwin lay\r\ndown and slept, but his slumber was uneasy and unrefreshing.  Sunrise\r\nawoke him, and he sat up with a feeling of deep thankfulness, as he\r\nbasked once more in its warm rays and observed that the sky above him\r\nwas bright blue.  But other feelings mingled with these when he gazed\r\nround on the wide waste of water, which still heaved its swelling though\r\nnow unruffled breast, as if panting after its recent burst of fury.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!  Cuffy--what's that?  Not a sail, eh?\" exclaimed Jarwin, suddenly\r\nstarting up, while his languid eyes kindled with excitement.\r\n\r\nHe was right.  After a long, earnest, anxious gaze, he came to the\r\nconclusion that it _was_ a sail which shone, white and conspicuous, like\r\na speck or a snow-flake on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nJARWIN AND CUFFY FALL INTO BAD COMPANY.\r\n\r\nImmediately on discovering the sail, Jarwin hoisted a small canvas flag,\r\nwhich he had prepared for the purpose, to the mast-head, and then sat\r\ndown to watch with indescribable earnestness the motions of the vessel.\r\nThere was great cause for anxiety he well knew, because his raft was a\r\nmere speck on the great waste of waters which might easily be overlooked\r\neven by a vessel passing at a comparatively short distance, and if the\r\nvessel's course should happen to lie across that of the raft, there was\r\nevery probability she would only be visible for a short time and then\r\npass away like a ray of hope dying out.\r\n\r\nAfter gazing in perfect silence for half-an-hour, Jarwin heaved a deep\r\nsigh and said--\r\n\r\n\"She steers this way, Cuffy.\"\r\n\r\nCuffy acknowledged the remark with a little whine and a very slight wag\r\nof his tail.  It was evident that his spirits had sunk to a low ebb, and\r\nthat he was not prepared to derive comfort from every trifling\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\n\"Come, we'll have a bit of summat to eat, my doggie,\" said the sailor,\r\nreaching forward his hand to the provision bundle.\r\n\r\nThoroughly understanding and appreciating this remark, Cuffy roused\r\nhimself and looked on with profound interest, while his master cut up a\r\ndried fish.  Having received a large share of it, he forgot everything\r\nelse, and devoted all his powers, physical and mental, to the business\r\nin hand.  Although Jarwin also applied himself to the food with the\r\ndevotion of a man whose appetite is sharp, and whose strength needs\r\nrecruiting, he was very far indeed from forgetting other things.  He\r\nkept his eyes the whole time on the approaching sail, and once or twice\r\nbecame so absorbed and so anxious lest the vessel should change her\r\ncourse, that he remained with his mouth half open, and with the\r\nunconsumed morsel reposing therein for a minute or more at a time.\r\n\r\nBut the vessel did not change her course.  On she came; a fine large\r\nschooner with raking masts, and so trim and neat in her rig that she\r\nresembled a pleasure-yacht.  As she drew near, Jarwin rose, and holding\r\non to the mast, waved a piece of canvas, while Cuffy, who felt that\r\nthere was now really good ground for rejoicing, wagged his tail and\r\nbarked in an imbecile fashion, as if he didn't exactly know whether to\r\nlaugh or cry.\r\n\r\n\"We're all safe now, doggie,\" exclaimed Jarwin, as the schooner came\r\ncutting through the water before a light breeze, leaving a slight track\r\nof foam in her wake.\r\n\r\nWhen within about two or three hundred yards of the raft, the castaway\r\ncould see that a figure leant on the vessel's side and brought a\r\ntelescope to bear on him.  With a feeling of irrepressible gladness he\r\nlaughed and waved his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, take a good squint,\" he shouted, \"an' then lower a boat--eh!--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly, for at that moment the figure turned towards the\r\nsteersman; the schooner's head fell away, presenting her stern to the\r\nraft, and began to leave her behind.\r\n\r\nThe truth flashed upon Jarwin like a thunderbolt.  It was clear that the\r\ncommander of the strange vessel had no intention of relieving him.  In\r\nthe first burst of mingled despair and indignation, the seaman uttered a\r\nbass roar of defiance that might have done credit to the lungs of a\r\nsmall carronade, and at the same time shook his fist at the retiring\r\nschooner.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this was as sudden as it was unexpected.  To his surprise\r\nhe observed that the schooner's head was immediately thrown up into the\r\nwind, and all her sails shook for a few moments, then, filling out\r\nagain, the vessel bent gracefully over on the other tack.  With\r\nreturning joy the castaway saw her run straight towards him.  In a few\r\nminutes she was alongside, and her topsails were backed.\r\n\r\n\"Look out! catch hold!\" cried a gruff voice, as a sailor sent a coil of\r\nrope whirling over the raft.  Jarwin caught it, took a turn round the\r\nmast, and held on.\r\n\r\nIn a minute the raft was alongside.  Weak though he was, Jarwin retained\r\nenough of his sailor-like activity to enable him to seize a rope and\r\nswing himself on board with Cuffy in his arms.\r\n\r\nHe found himself on the pure white deck of a craft which was so well\r\nappointed and so well kept, that his first impressions were revived--\r\nnamely, that she was a pleasure-yacht.  He knew that she was not a\r\nvessel of war, because, besides the absence of many little things that\r\nmark such a vessel, the few men on deck were not clothed like\r\nman-of-war's-men, and there was no sign of guns, with the exception of\r\none little brass carronade, which was probably used as a signal-gun.\r\n\r\nA tall stout man, in plain costume, which was neither quite that of a\r\nseaman nor a landsman, stood with his arms crossed on his broad chest\r\nnear the man at the wheel.  To him, judging him to be the captain or\r\nowner of the vessel, Jarwin went up, and, pulling his forelock by way of\r\nsalutation, said--\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir, I thought 'ee was a-goin' to leave me!\"\r\n\r\n\"So I was,\" answered the captain, drily.  \"Hold on to the raft,\" he\r\nadded, turning to the man who had thrown the rope to Jarwin.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" said the latter in some surprise, \"in course I don't know\r\nwhy you wos a-goin' to leave a feller-creetur to his fate, but I'm glad\r\nyou didn't go for to do it, 'cos it wouldn't have bin Christian-like.\r\nBut I'm bound for to thank 'ee, sir, all the same for havin' saved me--\r\nand Cuffy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be too free with your thanks, my good man,\" returned the captain,\r\n\"for you're not saved, as you call it, yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not saved yet?\" repeated Jarwin.\r\n\r\n\"No.  Whether I save you or not depends on your keeping a civil tongue\r\nin your head, and on your answers to my questions.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain interlarded his speech with many oaths, which, of course, we\r\nomit.  This, coupled with his rude manners, induced Jarwin to suspect\r\nthat the vessel was not a pleasure-yacht after all, so he wisely held\r\nhis peace.\r\n\r\n\"Where do you belong to?\" demanded the captain.\r\n\r\n\"To Yarmouth, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What ship did you sail in, what has come of her, and how came you to be\r\ncast adrift?\"\r\n\r\n\"I sailed in the _Nancy_, sir, from Plymouth, with a miscellaneous cargo\r\nfor China.  She sprung a leak in a gale, and we was 'bliged to make a\r\nraft, the boats bein' all stove in or washed away.  It was barely ready\r\nwhen the ship went down starn foremost.  Durin' the gale all my mates\r\nwere washed off the raft or died of exposure; only me and my dog left.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long ago was that?\" asked the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't rightly say, sir, I've lost count o' time, but it's more than\r\na year gone by anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a lie,\" said the captain, with an oath.\r\n\r\n\"No, 'taint, sir,\" replied Jarwin, reddening, \"it's a truth.  I was nigh\r\nstarved on that raft, but was cast on an island where I've bin till a\r\nfew days ago ever since, when I put to sea on the raft that now lays\r\na-starn there.\"\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds the captain made no rejoinder, but a glance at the\r\nraft seemed to satisfy him of the truth of what was said.  At length he\r\nsaid abruptly--\r\n\r\n\"What's your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"John Jarwin, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, John Jarwin, I'll save you on one condition, which is, that you\r\nbecome one of my crew, and agree to do my bidding and ask no questions.\r\nWhat say you?\"\r\n\r\nJarwin hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Haul up the raft and let this man get aboard of it,\" said the captain,\r\ncoolly but sternly, to the seaman who held the rope.\r\n\r\n\"You've no occasion to be so sharp, sir,\" said John, remonstratively.\r\n\"If you wos to tell me to cut my own throat, you know, I could scarce be\r\nexpected for to do it without puttin' a few questions as to the reason\r\nwhy.  You're a trader, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm a trader,\" replied the captain, \"but I don't choose to be\r\nquestioned by you.  All you've got to do is to agree to my proposal or\r\nto walk over the side.  To tell you the truth, when I saw you first\r\nthrough the glass, you looked such a starved wretch that I thought you'd\r\nbe of no use to me, and if it hadn't been for the yell you gave, that\r\nshowed there was something in you still, I'd have left you to sink or\r\nswim.  So you see what sort of man you've got to deal with.  I'm\r\nshort-handed, but not so short as to engage an unwilling man, or a man\r\nwho wouldn't be ready for any sort of dirty work.  You may take your\r\nchoice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" replied Jarwin, \"I've no objection to take service with\r\n'ee.  As the sayin' goes, `beggars mustn't be choosers.'  I ain't above\r\ndoin' dirty work, if required.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Jarwin, in the simplicity of his heart, imagined that the captain\r\nwas in need of a man who could and would turn his hand to any sort of\r\nwork, whether nautical or otherwise, on board ship or ashore, which was\r\nhis idea of \"dirty work;\" but the captain appeared to understand him in\r\na different sense, for he smiled in a grim fashion, nodded his head,\r\nand, turning to the seaman before mentioned, bade him cut the raft\r\nadrift.  The man obeyed, and in a few minutes it was out of sight\r\nastern.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Jarwin, go below,\" said the captain; \"Isaacs will introduce you to\r\nyour messmates.\"\r\n\r\nIsaacs, who had just cut away the raft, was a short, thick-set man, with\r\na dark, expressionless face.  He went forward without saying a word, and\r\nintroduced Jarwin to the men as a \"new 'and.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a green un, I s'pose; give us your flipper, lad,\" said one of the\r\ncrew, holding out his hand.\r\n\r\nJarwin shook it, took off his cap and sat down, while his new friends\r\nbegan, as they expressed it, to pump him.  Having no objection to be\r\npumped, he had soon related the whole of his recent history.  In the\r\ncourse of the narrative he discovered that his new associates were an\r\nunusually rough set.  Their language was interspersed with frightful\r\noaths, and their references to the captain showed that his power over\r\nthem was certainly not founded on goodwill or affection.  Jarwin also\r\ndiscovered that the freeness of his communication was not reciprocated\r\nby his new mates, for when he made inquiries as to the nature of the\r\ntrade in which they were engaged, some of the men merely replied with\r\nuproarious laughter, chaff, or curses, while others made jocular\r\nallusions to sandal-wood trading, slaving, etcetera.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't wonder now,\" said one, \"if you was to think we was\r\npirates.\"\r\n\r\nJarwin smiled as he replied, \"Well, I don't exactly think _that_, but\r\nI'm bound for to say the schooner _has_ got such a rakish look that it\r\nwouldn't seem unnatural like if you _were_ to hoist a black flag at the\r\npeak.  An' you'll excuse me, shipmets, if I say that yer lingo ain't\r\njust so polished as it might be.\"\r\n\r\n\"And pray who are _you_, that comes here to lecture us about our lingo?\"\r\ncried one of the men fiercely, starting up and confronting Jarwin with\r\nclenched fists.\r\n\r\n\"Why, mate,\" replied Jarwin, quietly folding back the cuffs of his coat,\r\nand putting himself in an attitude of defence, \"I ain't nobody in\r\npartikler, not the Lord Chancellor o' England, anyhow still less the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury.  I'm only plain Jack Jarwin, seaman, but if\r\nyou or any other man thinks--\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come,\" cried one of the men in a tone of authority, starting\r\nforward and thrusting Jarwin's assailant violently aside, \"none o' that\r\nsort o' thing here.  Keep your fists for the niggers, Bill, we're all\r\nbrothers here, you know; an affectionate family, so to speak!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a general laugh at this.  Bill retired sulkily, and Jarwin sat\r\ndown to a plate of hot \"lob-scouse,\" which proved to be very good, and\r\nof which he stood much in need.\r\n\r\nFor several days our hero was left very much to himself.  The schooner\r\nsped on her voyage with a fair wind, and the men were employed in light\r\nwork, or idled about the deck.  No one interfered with Jarwin, but at\r\nthe same time no one became communicative.  The captain was a very\r\nsilent man, and it was evident that the crew stood much in awe of him.\r\nOf course Jarwin's suspicions as to the nature of the craft were\r\nincreased by all this, and from some remarks which he overheard two or\r\nthree days after his coming on board, he felt convinced that he had\r\nfallen into bad company.  Before a week had passed, this became so\r\nevident that he made up his mind to leave the vessel at the very first\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nOne day he went boldly to the captain and demanded to know the nature of\r\nthe trade in which the schooner was employed and their present\r\ndestination.  He was told that that was no business of his, that he had\r\nbetter go forward and mind his duty without more ado, else he should be\r\npitched overboard.  The captain used such forcible language when he said\r\nthis, and seemed so thoroughly in earnest, that Jarwin felt no longer\r\nany doubt as to his true character.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what it is, my lad,\" said the captain, \"my schooner is a\r\ntrader or a man-of-war according to circumstances, and I'm a free man,\r\ngoing where I choose and doing what I please.  I treat my men well when\r\nthey do their duty; when they don't I make 'em walk the plank.  No doubt\r\nyou know what that means.  If you don't we shall soon teach you.  Take\r\nto-night to think over it.  To-morrow morning I'll have a question or\r\ntwo to ask you.  There--go!\"\r\n\r\nJarwin bowed submissively and retired.\r\n\r\nThat night the moon shone full and clear on the wide ocean's breast, and\r\nJarwin stood at the bow of the schooner, looking sadly over the side,\r\nand patting his little dog gently on the head.\r\n\r\n\"Cuffy, you and me's in a fix, I suspect,\" he murmured in a low tone;\r\n\"but cheer up, doggie, a way to escape will turn up no doubt.\"\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely uttered the words when his eye fell on the distant\r\noutline of land on the lee bow.  He started, and gazed with fixed\r\nintensity for some minutes, under the impression that it might perhaps\r\nbe a fog-bank lighted by the moon, but in a short time it became so\r\ndistinct that there could be no doubt it was land.  He pointed it out to\r\nthe watch on deck, one of whom said carelessly that he had seen it for\r\nsome time, and that there were plenty more islands of the same sort in\r\nthese seas.\r\n\r\nJarwin walked aft and stood near the lee gangway contemplating the\r\nisland in silence for some time.  A small oar lay at his feet.  Suddenly\r\nhe conceived the daring idea of seizing this, plunging overboard and\r\nattempting to swim to land.  He was a splendid swimmer, and although the\r\nisland appeared to be more than two miles distant, he did not fear\r\nfailure.  A moment's reflection, however, convinced him that the men on\r\ndeck would certainly hear the plunge, heave the ship to, and lower a\r\nboat, in which case he should be immediately overtaken.  Still, being\r\nresolved to escape at all hazards, he determined to make the venture.\r\nFastening a rope to a belaying pin, he tied the oar to it and lowered it\r\nover the side until it trailed in the water, he then lifted Cuffy, who\r\nwas almost always near him, on to the side of the vessel, with a whisper\r\nto keep still.  The watch paced the weather side of the deck conversing\r\nin low tones.  The steersman could, from his position, see both\r\ngangways, and although the light was not strong enough to reveal what\r\nJarwin was about, it was too strong to admit of his going bodily over\r\nthe side without being observed.  He, therefore, walked slowly to the\r\nhead of the vessel, where he threw over the end of a small rope.  By\r\nmeans of this, when the watch were well aft, he slid noiselessly into\r\nthe sea, hanging on by one hand and supporting Cuffy with the other.\r\nOnce fairly in the water he let go, the side of the vessel rubbed\r\nswiftly past him, and he all but missed grasping the oar which trailed\r\nat the gangway.  By this he held on for a few seconds to untie the rope.\r\nHe had just succeeded and was about to let go, when, unfortunately, the\r\nhandle of the oar chanced to hit the end of Cuffy's nose a severe blow.\r\nThe poor dog, therefore, gave vent to a loud yell of pain.  Instantly\r\nJarwin allowed himself to sink and held his breath as long as he\r\npossibly could, while Cuffy whined and swam on the surface.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the men on deck ran to the side.  \"Hallo!\" cried one, \"it's\r\nJarwin's little dog gone overboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it go,\" cried another with a laugh; \"it's a useless brute and eats\r\na power o' grub.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, wot a splashin' it do kick up,\" he added as the little dog was\r\nleft astern making vain efforts to clamber on the oar.  \"Why, lads,\r\nthere's somethin' else floatin' beside it, uncommon like a seal.  Are\r\n'ee sure, Bill, that Jarwin hasn't gone overboard along with his dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why no,\" replied Bill; \"I seed him go forward a little ago; besides it\r\nain't likely he'd go over without givin' a shout.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dun know that,\" said the other; \"he might have hit his head again'\r\nsomethin' in tumblin' over.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the objects in question were almost out of sight astern.\r\nIn a few minutes more a dark cloud covered the moon and effectually shut\r\nthem out from view.\r\n\r\nJust then the Captain came on deck, and asked what was wrong.\r\n\r\n\"Fools!\" he exclaimed, in a voice of thunder, on being told, \"lower the\r\ngig.  Look sharp!  Don't you see the land, you idiots?  The man's away\r\nas well as the dog.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds the topsails were backed and the boat lowered, manned,\r\nand pushed off.\r\n\r\nBut Jarwin heard and saw nothing of all this.  He was now far astern,\r\nfor the vessel had been going rapidly through the water.\r\n\r\nOn coming to the surface after his dive he caught hold of Cuffy, and,\r\nwith a cheering word or two, placed him on his back, telling him to hold\r\non by his paws the best way he could.  Then grasping the end of the oar,\r\nand pointing the blade land-wards, he struck out vigorously with his\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nIt was a long and weary swim, but as his life depended on it, the seaman\r\npersevered.  When he felt his strength giving way, he raised not only\r\nhis heart but his voice in prayer to God, and felt restored each time\r\nthat he did so.  Just as he neared the shore, the sound of oars broke on\r\nhis ears, and presently he heard the well-known voice of the Captain\r\nordering the men to pull hard.  Fortunately it was by this time very\r\ndark.  He landed without being discerned.  The surf was heavy, but he\r\nwas expert in rough water, went in on the top of a billow, and was\r\nsafely launched on a soft sandy beach, almost at the same moment with\r\nthe boat.  The latter was, however, at a considerable distance from him.\r\nHe crept cautiously up the shore until he gained a thicket, and then,\r\nrising, he plunged into the woods and ran straight before him until he\r\nwas exhausted, carrying the little dog in his arms.  Many a fall and\r\nbruise did the poor fellow receive in his progress, but the fear of\r\nbeing retaken by the pirates--for such he felt convinced they were--lent\r\nhim wings.  The Captain and his men made a long search, but finally gave\r\nit up, and, returning to the boat, pushed off.  Jarwin never saw them\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHe and Cuffy lay where they had fallen, and slept, wet though they were,\r\ntill the sun was high.  They were still sleeping when a native chief of\r\nthe island, happening to pass along the beach, discerned Jarwin's\r\nfootsteps and traced him out.  This chief was an immensely large\r\npowerful man, armed with a heavy club.  He awoke the sailor with a kick,\r\nand spoke in a language which he did not understand.  His gestures,\r\nhowever, said plainly enough, \"Get up and come along with me,\" so Jarwin\r\nthought it best to obey.  Of course whatever Jarwin thought, Cuffy was\r\nof precisely the same opinion.  They therefore quietly got up and\r\nfollowed the big chief to his village, where they were received by a\r\nlarge concourse of savages with much excitement and curiosity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nOUR HERO BECOMES A FAVOURITE, AND ENTERTAINS HOPES OF ESCAPE.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings which Jarwin with his little dog had hitherto undergone\r\nwere as nothing compared to those which he endured for some months after\r\nbeing taken prisoner by the savages.  At first he gave himself up for\r\nlost, feeling assured that ere long he would be sacrificed in the temple\r\nof one of their idols, and then baked in an oven and consumed as food,\r\naccording to the horrible practice of the South-Sea Islanders.  Indeed\r\nhe began to be much astonished that, as day after day passed, there was\r\nno sign of any intention to treat him in this way, although several\r\ntimes the natives took him out of the hut in which he was imprisoned,\r\nand, placing him in the centre of a circle, held excited and sometimes\r\nangry discussions over him.\r\n\r\nIt was not till months afterwards, when he had acquired a slight\r\nknowledge of their language, that he came to understand why he was\r\nspared at this time.  It appeared that four shipwrecked sailors, who had\r\nbeen cast on a neighbouring island, had been killed, baked, and eaten,\r\naccording to usage, by the chief and his friends.  Immediately\r\nafterwards, those who had partaken of this dreadful food had been seized\r\nwith severe illness, and one or two had died.  This fact had been known\r\nfor some time to Jarwin's captors, and the discussions above referred to\r\nhad been engaged in with reference to the question whether it was likely\r\nthat the flesh of the white man who had been thrown on their island\r\nwould be likely to disagree with their stomachs!  It was agreed that\r\nthis was highly probable, and thus the seaman's life was spared; but he\r\nwas sometimes tempted to wish that it had not been spared, for his\r\nmaster, the Big Chief, was a very hard man; he put him to the most\r\ntoilsome labour, and treated him with every sort of indignity.\r\nMoreover, he was compelled to be a witness of practices so revolting and\r\ncruel, that he often put the question to himself whether it was possible\r\nfor devils to display greater wickedness and depravity than these\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nJarwin was frequently tempted to resent the treatment he received, but,\r\nfortunately, he was prudent enough to bear it submissively, for it is\r\ncertain that if he had rebelled he would have been slain on the spot.\r\nMoreover, he set himself to carry out his favourite maxim--namely, that\r\nit was wise in all circumstances to make the best of everything.  He\r\nlaboured, therefore, with such goodwill, that he softened the breast of\r\nthe Big Chief, who gradually became more amiable, and even indulgent to\r\nhim.  Thus he came to know experimentally the wisdom of that Scripture,\r\n\"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Jarwin possessed a remarkably fine sonorous bass voice, which, in\r\nformer days, had been a source of great delight to his messmates.\r\nAlthough strong and deep, it was very sweet and tender in its tones, and\r\neminently suited for pathetic and sentimental songs.  Indeed Jarwin's\r\nnature was so earnest, that although he had a great deal of quiet humour\r\nabout him, and could enjoy comic songs very much, he never himself sang\r\nanything humorous.  Now, it chanced that the Big Chief had a good ear\r\nfor music, and soon became so fond of the songs which his slave was wont\r\nto hum when at work, that he used to make him sit down beside him\r\nfrequently and sing for hours at a time!  Fortunately, Jarwin's lungs\r\nwere powerful, and his voice being full-toned and loud, he was able to\r\nsing as much as his master desired without much exertion.  He gave him\r\nhis whole budget which was pretty extensive--including melodies of the\r\n\"Black-eyed Susan\" and \"Ben Bolt\" stamp.  When these had been sung over\r\nand over again, he took to the Psalms and Paraphrases--many of which he\r\nknew by heart, and, finally, he had recourse to extempore composition,\r\nwhich he found much easier than he had expected--the tones flowing\r\nnaturally and the words being gibberish!  Thus he became a sort of David\r\nto this remarkable Saul.  By degrees, as he learnt the native tongue, he\r\nheld long conversations with the Big Chief, and told him about his own\r\nland and countrymen and religion.  In regard to the last the Chief was\r\nvery inquisitive, and informed his slave that white men had been for\r\nsome time in that region, trying to teach their religion to the men of\r\nan island which, though invisible from his island, was not very far\r\ndistant.  Jarwin said little about this, but from that time he began to\r\nhope that, through the missionaries, he might be able to make his escape\r\nere long.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time poor Cuffy experienced a variety of vicissitudes,\r\nand made several narrow escapes.  At first he had been caught and was on\r\nthe point of being killed and roasted, when he wriggled out of his\r\ncaptor's grasp and made off to the mountains, terrorstruck!  Here he\r\ndwelt for some weeks in profound melancholy.  Being unable to stand\r\nseparation from his master any longer, he ventured to return to the\r\nvillage, but was immediately hunted out of it, and once again fled in\r\nhorror to the hills.  Jarwin was not allowed to quit the village alone,\r\nhe therefore never saw his little dog, and at length came to the\r\nconclusion that it had been killed.  When, however, he had ingratiated\r\nhimself with his master, he was allowed more freedom, and one day,\r\nhaving wandered a considerable distance into the mountains, he came\r\nsuddenly and unexpectedly upon Cuffy.  Having experienced nothing from\r\nman of late but the most violent and cruel treatment, Cuffy no sooner\r\nbeheld, as he supposed, one of his enemies, than, without giving him a\r\nsecond glance, he sprang up, put his ears back, his tail between his\r\nlegs, and, uttering a terrible yell, fled \"on the wings of terror!\"  But\r\nJarwin put two fingers in his mouth and gave a peculiarly shrill\r\nwhistle, which brought the dog to a sudden stop.  He looked back with\r\nears cocked.  Again Jarwin whistled.  Instantly Cuffy turned and ran at\r\nhim with a series of mingled yells, whines, and barks, that gave but a\r\nfaint idea of his tumultuous feelings.  It would scarcely be too much to\r\nsay that he almost ate his master up.  He became like an india-rubber\r\nball gone mad!  He bounded round him to such an extent that Jarwin found\r\nit very difficult to get hold of or pat him.  It is impossible to do\r\njustice to such a meeting.  We draw a veil over it, only remarking that\r\nthe sailor took his old favourite back to the village, and, after much\r\nentreaty and a good deal of persuasive song, was permitted to keep him.\r\n\r\nAbout ten months after this event, war broke out between the Big Chief\r\nand a neighbouring tribe of natives, who were a very quarrelsome and\r\nvindictive set.  The tribe with whom Jarwin dwelt would gladly have\r\nlived at peace, but the other tribe was stronger in numbers and thirsted\r\nfor conquest--a consequence of strength which is by no means confined to\r\nsavages!\r\n\r\nWhen war was formally declared, the Big Chief told Jarwin to prepare\r\nhimself for battle.  At first our hero had some qualms of conscience\r\nabout it, but on reflecting that on the part of the tribe to which he\r\nbelonged it was a war of self-defence, his conscience was pacified.\r\n\r\nThe Big Chief ordered him to throw away his now ragged garments, smear\r\nhis whole body over with oil and red earth, paint black spots on his\r\ncheeks, and a white streak down his nose, and put on warrior's costume.\r\nIn vain Jarwin begged and protested and sang.  The Big Chief's blood was\r\nup, and his commands must be obeyed, therefore Jarwin did as he was bid;\r\nwent out to battle in this remarkable costume--if we may so style it--\r\nand proved himself such a prodigy of valour that his prowess went far to\r\nturn the tide of victory wherever he appeared during the fight.  But we\r\npass over all this.  Suffice it to say, that the pugnacious tribe was\r\nseverely chastised and reduced to a state of quiet--for the time at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nOne day, not long after the cessation of the war, a canoe arrived with\r\nseveral natives, all of whom wore clothing of a much more civilised\r\ndescription than is usually seen among South-Sea savages.  They had a\r\nlong, earnest talk with the natives, but Jarwin was not allowed to hear\r\nit, or to show himself.  Next day they went away.  For some time after\r\nthat Big Chief was very thoughtful, but silent, and Jarwin could not\r\ninduce him to become confidential until he had sung all his melodies and\r\nall his psalms several times over, and had indulged in extempore melody\r\nand gibberish until his brain and throat were alike exhausted.  The Big\r\nChief gave way at last, however, and told him that his late visitors\r\nwere Christians, who, with two native teachers, had been sent from a\r\ndistant island by a white chief named Williams, to try and persuade him\r\nand his people to burn their idols.\r\n\r\n\"And are 'ee goin' to do it?\" asked Jarwin.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the Chief, \"but I am going to Raratonga to see Cookee\r\nWilliams.\"\r\n\r\nOf course they conversed in the native tongue, but as this would be\r\nunintelligible to the reader, we translate.  It may also be remarked\r\nhere that \"Cookee\" signified a white man, and is a word derived from the\r\nvisit of that great navigator Captain Cook to these islands, by the\r\nnatives of which he was ultimately murdered.\r\n\r\nJarwin had heard, while in England, of the missionary Williams.  On\r\nlearning that he was among the islands, his heart beat high, and he\r\nbegged earnestly that he might be allowed to go with the chief and his\r\nparty to Raratonga, but his wily master would not consent \"You will run\r\naway!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"No, I won't,\" said Jarwin, earnestly.  Big Chief shook his head.  \"They\r\nwill take you from me,\" he said, \"when they find out who you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll not let 'em,\" replied Jarwin, with pathetic sincerity, and then\r\nbegan to sing in such a touching strain, that his master lay back on his\r\ncouch and rolled his large eyes in rapture.\r\n\r\n\"You shall go, Jowin,\" (that was the best he could make of the name),\r\n\"if you will make me a promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Name it, old boy,\" said Jarwin.\r\n\r\n\"That you will go dressed like one of my young men, and never open your\r\nlips to speak a word, no more than if you were dumb, whether the Cookees\r\nspeak to you or not.\"\r\n\r\nJarwin hesitated, but reflecting that there was no chance of his seeing\r\nthe missionary at all if he did not give this promise, he consented.\r\n\r\nA week after that all the preparations were made, and four large canoes,\r\nfull of well-armed men, set out for Raratonga.\r\n\r\nAt the time we write of, the island of Raratonga had been recently\r\ndiscovered by the missionary Williams.  The success of the labours of\r\nthat devoted man and his native teachers, is one of the most marvellous\r\nchapters in the history of the isles of the Pacific.  At Raratonga, God\r\nseemed to have prepared the way for the introduction of the Gospel in a\r\nwonderful manner, for although the native teachers who first went ashore\r\nthere were roughly handled, they were enabled, nevertheless, to\r\npersevere, and in not much more than a single year, the Gospel wrought a\r\nchange in the feelings and habits of the people, which was little short\r\nof miraculous.  Within that brief period they had given up and burnt all\r\ntheir idols, had ceased to practise their bloody and horrible rites, and\r\nhad embraced Christianity--giving full proof of their sincerity by\r\nsubmitting to a code of laws founded on Scripture, by agreeing to\r\nabandon polygamy, by building a large place of worship, and by leading\r\ncomparatively virtuous and peaceful lives.  And all this was begun and\r\ncarried on for a considerable time, not by the European missionaries but\r\nby two of the devoted native teachers, who had previously embraced\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the change thus wrought in the Raratongans in so short a\r\ntime by the Gospel, may be estimated by a glance at the difficulties\r\nwith which the missionaries had to contend.  In writing of the ancient\r\nusages of the people, Mr Williams, [See Williams' most interesting\r\nwork, entitled \"A Narrative of Missionary Enterprises in the South-Sea\r\nIslands\"], tells us that one of their customs was an unnatural practice\r\ncalled _Kukumi anga_.  As soon as a son reached manhood, he would fight\r\nand wrestle with his father for the mastery, and if he obtained it,\r\nwould take forcible possession of the farm belonging to his parent, whom\r\nhe drove in a state of destitution from his home.  Another custom was\r\nequally unnatural and inhuman.  When a woman lost her husband, the\r\nrelatives of the latter, instead of paying visits of kindness to the\r\nfatherless and widow in their affliction, would seize every article of\r\nvalue belonging to the deceased, turn the disconsolate mother and her\r\nchildren away, and possess themselves of the house, food, and land.  But\r\nthey had another custom which caused still greater difficulties to the\r\nmissionaries.  It was called \"land-eating\"--in other words, the getting\r\npossession of each other's lands unjustly, and these, once obtained,\r\nwere held with the greatest possible tenacity, for land was exceedingly\r\nvaluable at Raratonga, and on no subject were the contentions of the\r\npeople more frequent or fierce.\r\n\r\nFrom this it will be seen that the Raratongans were apparently a most\r\nunpromising soil in which to plant the \"good seed,\" for there is\r\nscarcely another race of people on earth so depraved and unnatural as\r\nthey seem to have been.  Nevertheless, God's blessed Word overcame these\r\ndeep-rooted prejudices, and put an end to these and many other horrible\r\npractices in little more than a year.\r\n\r\nAfter this glorious work had been accomplished, the energetic\r\nmissionary--who ultimately laid down his life in one of these islands\r\n[_The Island of Erramanga_] for the sake of Jesus Christ--resolved to go\r\nhimself in search of other islands in which to plant the Gospel, and to\r\nsend out native teachers with the same end in view.  The record of their\r\nlabours reads more like a romance than a reality, but we cannot afford\r\nto diverge longer from the course of our narrative.  It was one of these\r\nsearching parties of native teachers that had visited the Big Chief's\r\nisland as already described, and it was their glowing words and\r\nrepresentations that had induced him to undertake this voyage to\r\nRaratonga.\r\n\r\nBig Chief of course occupied the largest of the four canoes, and our\r\nfriend Jarwin sat on a seat in front of him--painted and decorated like\r\na native warrior, and wielding a paddle like the rest.  Of course Cuffy\r\nhad been left behind.\r\n\r\nPoor Jarwin had, during his captivity, undergone the process of being\r\ntatooed from head to foot.  It had taken several months to accomplish\r\nand had cost him inexpressible torture, owing to the innumerable\r\npunctures made by the comb-like instrument with which it was done on the\r\ninflamed muscles of his body.  By dint of earnest entreaty and much\r\nsong, he had prevailed on Big Chief to leave his face and hands\r\nuntouched.  It is doubtful if he would have succeeded in this, despite\r\nthe witching power of his melodious voice, had he not at the same time\r\noffered to paint his own face in imitation of tatooing, and accomplished\r\nthe feat to such perfection that his delighted master insisted on having\r\nhis own painted forthwith in the same style.\r\n\r\nDuring a pause in their progress, while the paddlers were resting, Big\r\nChief made his captive sit near him.\r\n\r\n\"You tell me that Cookee-men\" (by which he meant white men) \"never lie,\r\nnever deceive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shud lie an' deceive myself, if I said so,\" replied Jarwin, bluntly.\r\n\r\n\"What did you tell me, then?\" asked the Chief, with a frown.\r\n\r\n\"I told you that _Christian_ men don't lie or deceive--leastwise they\r\ndon't do it with a will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are _you_ a Christian man, Jowin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" replied the sailor promptly.  Then with a somewhat perplexed\r\nair, \"Anyhow I _hope_ I am, an' I try to act as sitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, I will soon prove it.  You will be near the Cookee-men of\r\nRaratonga to-morrow.  You will have chance to go with them and leave me;\r\nbut if you do, or if you speak one word of Cookee-tongue--you are _not_\r\nChristian.  Moreover, I will batter your skull with my club, till it is\r\nlike the soft pulp of the bread-fruit.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a cute fellar, as the Yankees say,\" remarked Jarwin, with a\r\nslight smile.  This being said in English, the Chief took no notice of\r\nit, but glanced at his slave suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"Big Chief,\" said Jarwin, after a short silence, \"even before I was a\r\nChristian, I had been taught by my mother to be ashamed of telling a\r\nlie, so you've no occasion for to doubt me.  But it's a hard thing to\r\nstand by a countryman, specially in my pecooliar circumstances, an' not\r\nlet him know that you can speak to him.  May I not be allowed to palaver\r\na bit with 'em?  I wont ask 'em to take me from you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Chief sternly.  \"You came with me promising that you\r\nwould not even speak to the Cookee-men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Big Chief,\" replied Jarwin, energetically, \"you shall see that a\r\nBritish seaman can stick to his promise.  I'll be true to you.  Honour\r\nbright.  I'll not give 'em a word of the English lingo if they was to\r\ntry to tear it out o' me wi' red hot pincers.  I'll content myself wi'\r\nlookin' at 'em and listenin' to 'em.  It'll be a comfort to hear my\r\nmother-tongue, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" replied the Chief, \"I trust you.\"\r\n\r\nThe interval of rest coming to an end at this point, the conversation\r\nceased and the paddles were resumed.\r\n\r\nIt was a magnificent day.  The great Pacific was in that condition of\r\nperfect repose which its name suggests.  Not a breath of air ruffled the\r\nwide sheet of water, which lay spread out like a vast circular\r\nlooking-glass to reflect the sky, and it did reflect the sky with such\r\nperfect fidelity, that the clouds and cloudlets in the deep were exact\r\ncounterparts of those that floated in the air, while the four canoes,\r\nresting on their own reflections, seemed to be suspended in the centre\r\nof a crystal world, which was dazzlingly lit up by two resplendent suns.\r\n\r\nThis condition of calm lasted the whole of that day and night, and the\r\nheat was very great; nevertheless the warriors--of whom there were from\r\nforty to fifty in each canoe--did not cease to paddle for an instant,\r\nsave when the short spells of rest came round, and when, twice during\r\nthe day, they stopped to eat a hasty meal.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun set they still continued to paddle onwards, the only\r\ndifference being that instead of passing over a sea of crystal, they\r\nappeared to traverse an ocean of amber and burnished gold.  All night\r\nthey continued their labours.  About daybreak the Chief permitted them\r\nto enjoy a somewhat longer period of rest, during which most of them,\r\nwithout lying down, indulged in a short but refreshing nap.  Resuming\r\nthe paddles, they proceeded until sunrise, when their hearts were\r\ngladdened by the sight of the blue hills of Raratonga on the bright\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n\"Now we shall soon be at the end of our voyage,\" said the Chief, as he\r\npointed to the distant hills, and glanced at Jarwin as he might at a\r\nprize which he was much afraid of losing.  \"Remember the promise, you\r\nChristian.  Don't be a deceiver, you `Breetish tar!'\" (He quoted Jarwin\r\nhere.)\r\n\r\n\"Honour bright!\" replied our hero.\r\n\r\nThe savage gazed earnestly into the sailor's bright eyes, and appeared\r\nto think that if his honour was as bright as they were, there was not\r\nmuch cause to fear.  At all events he looked pleased, nodded his head,\r\nand said \"Good,\" with considerable emphasis.\r\n\r\nBy this time the hills of Raratonga were beginning to look less like\r\nblue clouds and more like real mountains; gradually as the canoes drew\r\nnearer, the markings on them became more and more defined, until at last\r\neverything was distinctly visible--rocky eminences and luxuriant\r\nvalleys, through which flowed streams and rivulets that glittered\r\nbrightly in the light of the ascending sun, and almost constrained\r\nJarwin to shout with delight, for he gazed upon a scene more lovely by\r\nfar than anything that he had yet beheld in the Southern Seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nOUR HERO IS EXPOSED TO STIRRING INFLUENCES AND TRYING CIRCUMSTANCES.\r\n\r\nWhen the four canoes drew near to the island, immense numbers of natives\r\nwere seen to assemble on the beach, so that Big Chief deemed it\r\nadvisable to advance with caution.  Presently a solitary figure, either\r\ndressed or painted black, advanced in front of the others and waved a\r\nwhite flag.  This seemed to increase the Chief's anxiety, for he ordered\r\nthe men to cease paddling.\r\n\r\nJarwin, whose heart had leaped with delight when he saw the dark figure\r\nand the white flag, immediately turned round and said--\r\n\r\n\"You needn't be afraid, old boy; that's the missionary, I'll be bound,\r\nin his black toggery, an' a white flag means `peace' among Cookee men.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, the Chief gave the order to advance, and Jarwin,\r\nseizing a piece of native cloth that lay near him, waved it round his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"Stop that, you Breetish tar!\" growled Big Chief, seizing a huge club,\r\nwhich bristled with shark's teeth, and shaking it at the seaman, while\r\nhis own teeth were displayed in a threatening grin.\r\n\r\n\"All right, old codger,\" replied the British tar, with a submissive\r\nlook; \"honour bright, honour bright,\" he added several times, in a low\r\ntone, as if to keep himself in mind of his promise.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that our hero and his master talked in the native\r\ntongue, which the former had acquired with wonderful facility, but such\r\nfamiliar expressions as \"old boy,\" \"old codger,\" etcetera, were\r\nnecessarily uttered in English.  Fortunately for Jarwin, who was by\r\nnature free-and-easy, the savage chief imagined these to be terms of\r\nrespect, and was, consequently, rather pleased to hear them.  Similarly,\r\nBig Chief said \"Breetish tar\" and \"Christian\" in English, as he had\r\nlearned them from his captive.  When master and slave began to grow fond\r\nof each other--as we have seen that they soon did, their manly natures\r\nbeing congenial--they used these expressions more frequently: Jarwin\r\nmeaning to express facetious goodwill, but his master desiring to\r\nexpress kindly regard, except when he was roused to anger, in which case\r\nhe did not, however, use them contemptuously, but as expressive of\r\nearnest solemnity.\r\n\r\nOn landing, Big Chief and his warriors were received by the Reverend Mr\r\nWilliams and his native teachers--of whom there were two men and two\r\nwomen--with every demonstration of kindness, and were informed that the\r\nisland of Raratonga had cast away and burned its idols, and now\r\nworshipped the true God, who had sent His Son Jesus Christ to save the\r\nworld from sin.\r\n\r\n\"I know that,\" replied Big Chief to the teacher who interpreted;\r\n\"converts, like yourself, came to my island not long ago, and told me\r\nall about it.  Now I have come to see and hear.  A wise man will know\r\nand understand before he acts.\"\r\n\r\nBig Chief was then conducted to the presence of the king of that part of\r\nthe island, who stood, surrounded by his chief men, under a grove of\r\nTemanu trees.  The king, whose name was Makea, was a handsome man, in\r\nthe prime of life, about six feet high, and very massive and muscular.\r\nHe had a noble appearance and commanding aspect, and, though not so tall\r\nas Big Chief, was, obviously, a man of superior power in every way.  His\r\ncomplexion was light, and his body most beautifully tatooed and slightly\r\ncoloured with a preparation of tumeric and ginger, which gave it a light\r\norange tinge, and, in the estimation of the Raratongans, added much to\r\nthe beauty of his appearance.\r\n\r\nThe two chiefs advanced frankly to each other, and amiably rubbed noses\r\ntogether--the South Sea method of salutation!  Then a long palaver\r\nensued, in which Big Chief explained the object of his visit, namely, to\r\nhear about the new religion, and to witness its effects with his own\r\neyes.  The missionary gladly gave him a full account of all he desired\r\nto know, and earnestly urged him to accept the Gospel of Jesus Christ,\r\nand to throw away his idols.\r\n\r\nBig Chief and his men listened with earnest attention and intense\r\ngravity, and, after the palaver was over, retired to consult together in\r\nprivate.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time poor Jarwin's heart had been greatly stirred.\r\nBeing tatooed, and nearly naked, as well as painted like the rest of his\r\ncomrades, of course no one took particular notice of him, which\r\ndepressed him greatly, for he felt an intense desire to seize the\r\nmissionary by the hand, and claim him as a countryman.  Indeed this\r\nfeeling was so strong upon him on first hearing Mr Williams's English\r\ntone of voice--although the missionary spoke only in the native tongue--\r\nthat he could scarcely restrain himself, and had to mutter \"honour\r\nbright\" several times, in order, as it were, to hold himself in check.\r\n\"Honour bright\" became his moral rein, or curb, on that trying occasion.\r\nBut when, in the course of the palaver, Mrs Williams, who had\r\naccompanied her husband on this dangerous expedition, came forward and\r\naddressed a few words to the missionary in English, he involuntarily\r\nsprang forward with an exclamation of delight at hearing once more the\r\nold familiar tongue.  He glanced, however, at Big Chief, and checked\r\nhimself.  There was a stern expression on the brow of the savage, but\r\nhis eyes remained fixed on the ground, and his form and face were\r\nimmovable, as though he heard and saw nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Honour bright,\" whispered Jarwin, as he turned about and retired among\r\nhis comrades.\r\n\r\nFortunately his sudden action had only attracted the attention of a few\r\nof those who were nearest to him, and no notice was taken of it.\r\n\r\nWhen Big Chief retired with his men for consultation, he called Jarwin\r\naside.\r\n\r\n\"Jarwin,\" he said, with unusual gravity, \"you must not hear our\r\npalaver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not, old feller?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is your business to obey, not to question,\" replied Big Chief,\r\nsternly.  \"Go--when I want you I will find you.  You may go and _look_\r\nat the Cookee missionary, but, remember, I have your promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Honour bright,\" replied Jarwin with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"The promise of a Breetish tar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" replied Jarwin.\r\n\r\n\"Of a _Christian_?\" said Big Chief, with emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, that's the idee; but it's a hard case, old boy, to advise a poor\r\nfeller to go into the very jaws o' temptation.  I would rather 'ee had\r\nordered me to keep away from 'em.  Howsever, here goes!\"\r\n\r\nMuttering these words to himself, he left his savage friends to hold\r\ntheir palaver, and went straight into the \"jaws of temptation,\" by\r\nwalking towards the cottage of the missionary.  It was a neat wooden\r\nerection, built and plastered by the natives.  Jarwin hung about the\r\ndoor; sometimes he even ventured to peep in at the windows, in his\r\nintense desire to see and hear the long-lost forms and tones of his\r\nnative land; and, as the natives generally were much addicted to such\r\nindications of curiosity, his doing so attracted no unusual attention.\r\n\r\nWhile he was standing near the door, Mrs Williams unexpectedly came\r\nout.  Jarwin, feeling ashamed to appear in so _very_ light a costume\r\nbefore a lady, turned smartly round and walked away.  Then, reflecting\r\nthat he was quite as decently clothed as the other natives about, he\r\nturned again and slowly retraced his steps, pretending to be interested\r\nin picking stones and plants from the ground.\r\n\r\nThe missionary's wife looked at him for a moment with no greater\r\ninterest than she would have bestowed on any other native, and then\r\ngazed towards the sea-shore, as if she expected some one.  Presently Mr\r\nWilliams approached.\r\n\r\n\"Well, have you been successful?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it has been all arranged satisfactorily, so I shall begin at\r\nonce,\" replied Mr Williams.  \"The only thing that gives me anxiety is\r\nthe bellows.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Jarwin drew nearer and nearer.  His heart was again stirred in a\r\nway that it had not been for many a day, and he had to pull the rein\r\npretty tightly; in fact, it required all his Christianity and\r\nBritish-tar-hood to prevent him from revealing himself, and claiming\r\nprotection at that moment.\r\n\r\nAs he raised himself, and gazed with intense interest at the speakers,\r\nthe missionary's attention became fixed on him, and he beckoned him to\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n\"I think you are one of the strangers who have just arrived, are you\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\nThis was spoken in the language of Raratonga, which was so similar to\r\nthat which he had already acquired, that he opened his mouth to reply,\r\n\"Yes, your honour,\" or \"Your reverence,\" in English.  But it suddenly\r\noccurred to him that he must translate this into the native tongue if\r\nhis secret was to be preserved.  While he was turning over in his mind\r\nthe best words to use for this purpose he reflected that the\r\nimperfection of his knowledge, even the mere tone of his voice, would\r\nprobably betray him; he therefore remained dumb, with his mouth open.\r\n\r\nThe missionary smiled slightly, and repeated his question.\r\n\r\nJarwin, in great perplexity, still remained dumb.  Suddenly an idea\r\nflashed across his mind.  He pointed to his mouth, wagged his tongue,\r\nand shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you are dumb, my poor man,\" said the missionary, with a look of\r\npity.\r\n\r\n\"Or tabooed,\" suggested the lady; \"his tongue may have been tabooed.\"\r\n\r\nThere was some reason and probability in this, for the extraordinary\r\ncustom of tabooing, by which various things are supposed to be rendered\r\nsacred, and therefore not to be used or touched, is extended by the\r\nSouth Sea Islanders to various parts of their bodies, as for instance,\r\nthe hands; in which case the person so tabooed must, for a time, be fed\r\nby others, as he dare not use his hands.\r\n\r\nJarwin, being aware of the custom, was so tickled by the idea of his\r\ntongue being tabooed, that he burst into an uncontrollable fit of\r\nlaughter, to the intense amazement of his questioners.  While in the\r\nmidst of this laugh, he became horrified by the thought that _that_ of\r\nitself would be sufficient to betray him, so he cleverly remedied the\r\nevil, and gave vent to his feelings by tapering the laugh off into a\r\nhideous yell, and rushed frantically from the spot.\r\n\r\n\"Strange,\" observed the missionary, gazing after the fugitive mariner,\r\n\"how like that was to an English laugh!\"\r\n\r\n\"More like the cry of a South Sea maniac, I think,\" said Mrs Williams,\r\nre-entering the house, followed by her husband.\r\n\r\nThe matter which the missionary said had been arranged so\r\nsatisfactorily, and was to be begun at once, was neither more nor less\r\nthan the building of a ship, in which to traverse the great\r\nisland-studded breast of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIn case some one, accustomed to think of the ponderous vessels which are\r\nbuilt constantly in this land with such speed and facility, should be\r\ninclined to regard the building of a ship a small matter, we shall point\r\nout a few of the difficulties with which the missionary had to contend\r\nin this projected work.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he was on what is sometimes styled a \"savage\r\nisland\"--an island that lay far out of the usual track of ships, that\r\nhad only been discovered a little more than a year at that time, and was\r\ninhabited by a blood-thirsty, savage, cruel, and ignorant race of human\r\nbeings, who had renounced idolatry and embraced Christianity only a few\r\nmonths before.  They knew no more of ship-building than the celebrated\r\nman in the moon, and their methods of building canoes were quite\r\ninapplicable to vessels of large capacity.  Besides this, Mr Williams\r\nwas the only white man on the island, and he had no suitable implements\r\nfor shipbuilding, except axes and augurs, and a few of the smaller of\r\nthe carpenter's tools.  In the building of a vessel, timbers and planks\r\nare indispensable, but he had no pit-saw wherewith to cut these.  It is\r\nnecessary to fasten planks and timbers together, but he had no nails to\r\ndo this.  Heavy iron forgings were required for some parts of the\r\nstructure, but, although he possessed iron, he had no smith's anvil, or\r\nhammer, or tongs, or bellows, wherewith to forge it.  In these\r\ncircumstances he commenced one of the greatest pieces of work ever\r\nundertaken by man--greatest, not only because of the mechanical\r\ndifficulties overcome, but because of the influence for good that the\r\nship, when completed, had upon the natives of the Southern Seas, as well\r\nas its reflex influence in exciting admiration, emulation, and\r\nenthusiasm in other lands.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty was the bellows.  Nothing could be done without\r\nthese and the forge.  There were four goats on the island.  Three of\r\nthese were sacrificed; their skins were cut up, and, along with two\r\nboards, converted into a pair of smith's bellows in four days.\r\n\r\nNo one can imagine the intense interest with which John Jarwin looked on\r\nwhile the persevering but inexperienced missionary laboured at this\r\nwork, and tremendous was the struggle which he had to keep his hands\r\nidle and his tongue quiet; for he was a mechanical genius, and could\r\nhave given the missionary many a useful hint, but did not dare to do so\r\nlest his knowledge, or voice, or aptitude for such work, or all these\r\nput together, should betray him.  He was, therefore, fain to content\r\nhimself with looking on, or performing a few trifling acts in the way of\r\nlifting, carrying, and hewing with the axe.\r\n\r\nHis friends frequently came to look on, as the work progressed, and he\r\ncould not help fancying that they regarded him with looks of peculiar\r\ninterest.  This perplexed him, but, supposing that it must result from\r\nsuspicion of his integrity, he took no notice of it, save that he became\r\nmore resolute than ever in reference to \"honour bright!\"  Big Chief also\r\ncame to look on and wonder, but, although he kept a sharp eye on his\r\nslave, he did not seem to desire intercourse with him.\r\n\r\nWhen the bellows were finished, it was found that they did not work\r\nproperly.  The upper box did not fill well, and, when tried, they were\r\nnot satisfied with blowing wind out, but insisted on drawing fire in!\r\nThey were, in short, a failure!  Deep were the ponderings of the\r\nmissionary as to how this was to be remedied, and small was the light\r\nthrown on the subject by the various encyclopaedias and other books\r\nwhich he possessed; but the question was somewhat abruptly settled for\r\nhim by the rats.  These creatures devoured all the leather of the\r\nbellows in a single night, and left nothing but the bare boards!\r\n\r\nRats were an absolute plague at that time at Raratonga.  Mr Williams\r\ntells us, in his interesting \"Narrative,\" that he and his family never\r\nsat down to a meal without having two or more persons stationed to keep\r\nthem off the table.  When kneeling at family prayer, they would run over\r\nthem in all directions, and it was found difficult to keep them out of\r\nthe beds.  On one occasion, when the servant was making one of the beds,\r\nshe uttered a scream, and, on rushing into the room, Mr Williams found\r\nthat four rats had crept under the pillow and made themselves snug\r\nthere.  They paid for their impudence, however, with their lives.  On\r\nanother occasion, a pair of English shoes, which had not been put in the\r\nusual place of safety, were totally devoured in a night, and the same\r\nfate befell the covering of a hair-trunk.  No wonder, then, that they\r\ndid not spare the bellows!\r\n\r\nPoor Jarwin sorrowed over this loss fully as much as did the missionary,\r\nbut he was forced to conceal his grief.\r\n\r\nStill bent on discovering some method of \"raising the wind,\" Mr\r\nWilliams appealed to his inventive powers.  He considered that if a pump\r\nthrew water, there was no reason why it should not throw wind.\r\nImpressed with this belief, he set to work and made a box about eighteen\r\nor twenty inches square and four feet high, with a valve in the bottom\r\nto let air in, a hole in the front to let it out, and a sort of piston\r\nto force it through the hole.  By means of a long lever the piston could\r\nbe raised, and by heavy weights it was pushed down.  Of course\r\nconsiderable power was required to raise the piston and its weights, but\r\nthere was a superabundance of power, for thousands of wondering natives\r\nwere ready and eager to do whatever they were bid.  They could have\r\npumped the bellows had they been the size of a house!  They worked\r\nadmirably in some respects, but had the same fault as the first pair,\r\nnamely, a tendency to suck in the fire!  This, however, was corrected by\r\nmeans of a valve at the back of the pipe which communicated with the\r\nfire.  Another fault lay in the length of interval between the blasts.\r\nThis was remedied by making another box of the same kind, and working\r\nthe two alternately, so that when one was blowing the fire, the other\r\nwas, as it were, taking breath.  Thus a continuous blast was obtained,\r\nwhile eight or ten grinning and delighted natives worked the levers.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty being thus overcome, the work progressed rapidly.\r\nA large hard stone served for an anvil, and a small stone, perforated,\r\nwith a handle affixed to it, did duty for a hammer.  A pair of\r\ncarpenter's pincers served for tongs, and charcoal, made from the\r\ncocoanut and other trees, did duty for coals.  In order to obtain\r\nplanks, the missionary split trees in half with wedges and then the\r\nnatives thinned them down with adzes extemporised by fitting crooked\r\nhandles to ordinary hatchets.  When a bent or twisted plank was\r\nrequired, having no apparatus for steaming it, he bent a piece of bamboo\r\nto the required shape, and sent natives to scour the woods in search of\r\na suitable crooked tree.  Thus planks suited to his purpose were\r\nobtained.  Instead of fastening the planks to the timbers of the ship\r\nwith iron nails, large wooden pins, or \"trenails,\" were used, and driven\r\ninto augur holes, and thus the fabric was held together.  Instead of\r\noakum, cocoanut husk was used, and native cloth and dried banana stumps\r\nto caulk the seams, and make them watertight.  The bark of a certain\r\ntree was spun into twine and rope by a rope-machine made for the\r\npurpose, and a still more complex machine, namely, a turning-lathe, was\r\nconstructed for the purpose of turning the block sheaves; while sails\r\nwere made out of native mats, quilted to give them sufficient strength\r\nto resist the wind.\r\n\r\nBy these means was completed, in about three months, a decked vessel of\r\nfrom seventy to eighty tons burden--about sixty feet long by eighteen\r\nbroad.  She was finally launched and named _The Messenger of Peace_.\r\nAnd, truly, a messenger of peace and glad tidings did she afterwards\r\nprove to be on many occasions among the islands of the Southern Seas.\r\n\r\nBut our hero, John Jarwin, was not allowed to remain to see this happy\r\nconsummation.  He only looked on and assisted at the commencement of the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nMany and many a time did he, during that trying period, argue with\r\nhimself as to the propriety of his conduct in thus refusing the means of\r\nescape when it was thrown in his way, and there was not wanting, now and\r\nthen, a suggestion from somewhere--he knew not where, but certainly it\r\nwas not from outside of him--that perhaps the opportunity had been\r\n_providentially_ thrown in his way.  But Jarwin resisted these\r\nsuggestions.  He looked _up_, and reflected that he was there under a\r\nsolemn promise; that, but for his promise, he should not have been there\r\nat all, and that, therefore, it was his peculiar duty at that particular\r\ntime to whisper to himself continually--\"honour bright!\"\r\n\r\nOne morning Big Chief roused Jarwin with his toe, and said--\r\n\r\n\"Get up.  We go home now.\"\r\n\r\n\"What say 'ee, old man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Get ready.  We go to-day.  I have seen and heard enough.\"\r\n\r\nBig Chief was very stern, so that Jarwin thought it wise to hold his\r\ntongue and obey.\r\n\r\nThere was a long animated palaver between the chief, the missionary, and\r\nthe king, but Jarwin had been carefully prevented from hearing it by his\r\nmaster, who ordered him to keep by the canoes, which were launched and\r\nready.  Once again he was assailed by an intense desire to escape, and\r\nthis sudden approach of the time that was perchance to fix his fate for\r\nlife rendered him almost desperate--but he still looked up, and \"honour\r\nbright\" carried the day.  He remained dumb to the last, and did not even\r\nallow himself the small comfort of waving a piece of native cloth to the\r\nmissionary, as he and his captors paddled from the Raratonga shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nDESPAIR IS FOLLOWED BY SURPRISES AND DELIVERANCE.\r\n\r\nAt first John Jarwin could not quite realise his true position after\r\nleaving Raratonga.  The excitement consequent on the whole affair\r\nremained for some time on his mind, causing him to feel as if it were a\r\ndream, and it was not until he had fairly landed again on Big Chief's\r\nisland, and returned to his own little hut there, and had met with\r\nCuffy--whose demonstrations of intense delight cannot by any possibility\r\nbe described--that he came fully to understand the value of the\r\nopportunity which he had let slip through his fingers.\r\n\r\nPoor Jarwin! words fail to convey a correct idea of the depth of his\r\ndespair, for now he saw clearly, as he thought, that perpetual slavery\r\nwas his doom.  Under the influence of the feelings that overwhelmed him\r\nhe became savage.\r\n\r\n\"Cuff,\" said he, on the afternoon of the day of his return, \"it's all up\r\nwith you and me, old chap.\"\r\n\r\nThe tone in which this was uttered was so stern that the terrier drooped\r\nits ears, lowered its tail, and looked up with an expression that was\r\nequivalent to \"Don't kick me, _please_ don't!\"\r\n\r\nJarwin smiled a grim yet a pitiful smile as he looked at the dog.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's all up with us,\" he continued; \"we shall live and die in\r\nslavery; wot a fool I was not to cut and run when I had the chance!\"\r\n\r\nThe remembrance of \"honour bright\" flashed upon him here, but he was\r\nstill savage, and therefore doggedly shut his eyes to it.\r\n\r\nAt this point a message was brought to him from Big Chief requesting his\r\nattendance in the royal hut.  Jarwin turned angrily on the messenger and\r\nbid him begone in a voice of thunder, at the same time intimating, by a\r\nmotion of his foot, that if he did not obey smartly, he would quicken\r\nhis motions for him.  The messenger vanished, and Jarwin sat down beside\r\nCuffy--who looked excessively humble--and vented his feelings thus--\r\n\r\n\"I can't stand it no longer Cuff.  I _won't_ stand it!  I'm goin' to\r\nbust up, I am; so look out for squalls.\"\r\n\r\nA feeling of uncertainty as to the best method of \"busting up\" induced\r\nhim to clutch his hair with both hands, and snort.  It must not be\r\nsupposed that our hero gave way to such rebellious feelings with\r\nimpunity.  On the contrary, his conscience pricked him to such an extent\r\nthat it felt like an internal pin-cushion or hedgehog.  While he was\r\nstill holding fast to his locks in meditative uncertainty, three natives\r\nappeared at the entrance of his hut, and announced that they had been\r\nsent by Big Chief to take him to the royal hut by force, in case he\r\nshould refuse to go peaceably.\r\n\r\nUttering a shout of defiance, the exasperated man sprang up and rushed\r\nat the natives, who, much too wise to await the onset, fled in three\r\ndifferent directions.  Instead of pursuing any of them, Jarwin went\r\nstraight to his master's hut, where he found him seated on a couch of\r\nnative cloth.  Striding up to him he clenched his fist, and holding it\r\nup in a threatening manner, exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"Now look 'ee here, Big Chief--which it would be big thief if 'ee had\r\nyer right name--I ain't goin' to stand this sort o' thing no longer.  I\r\nkep' my word to you all the time we wos at Raratonga, but now I'll keep\r\nit no longer.  I'll do my best to cut the cable and make sail the wery\r\nfirst chance I gits--so I give 'ee fair warnin'.\"\r\n\r\nBig Chief made no reply for some moments, but opened his eyes with such\r\nan intense expression of unaffected amazement, that Jarwin's wrath\r\nabated, in spite of his careful nursing of it to keep it warm.\r\n\r\n\"Jowin,\" he exclaimed at length, \"you Christian Breetish tar, have your\r\ndibbil got into you?\"\r\n\r\nThis question effectually routed Jarwin's anger.  He knew that the\r\nsavage, to whom he had spoken at various times on the subject of satanic\r\ninfluence, was perfectly sincere in his inquiry, as well as in his\r\nastonishment.  Moreover, he himself felt surprised that Big Chief, who\r\nwas noted for his readiness to resent insult, should have submitted to\r\nhis angry tones and looks and threatening manner without the slightest\r\nevidence of indignation.  The two men therefore stood looking at each\r\nother in silent surprise for a few moments.\r\n\r\n\"Big Chief,\" said Jarwin at last, bringing his right fist down heavily\r\ninto his left palm, by way of emphasis, \"there's no dibbil, as you call\r\nhim, got possession o' me.  My own spirit is dibbil enough, I find, to\r\naccount for all that I've said and done--an' a great deal more.  But it\r\n_has_ bin hard on me to see the door open, as it were, an' not take\r\nadwantage of it.  Howsever, it's all over now, an' I ax yer parding.\r\nI'll not mutiny again.  You've been a kind feller to me, old chap--\r\nthough you _are_ a savage--an' I ain't on-grateful; as long as I'm your\r\nslave I'll do my duty--`honour bright;' at the same time I think it fair\r\nan' above board to let you know that I'll make my escape from you when I\r\ngit the chance.  I'm bound for to sarve you while I eat your wittles,\r\nbut I am free to go if I can manage it.  There--you may roast me alive\r\nan' eat me, if you like, but you can't say, after this, that I'm sailin'\r\nunder false colours.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this speech a variety of expressions affected the countenance of\r\nBig Chief, but that of melancholy predominated.\r\n\r\n\"Jowin,\" he said, slowly, \"I like you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a good-hearted old buffer,\" said Jarwin, grasping the Chief's\r\nhand, and squeezing it; \"to say the truth, I'm wery fond o' yourself,\r\nbut it's nat'ral that I should like my freedom better.\"\r\n\r\nBig Chief pondered this for some time, and shook his head slowly, as if\r\nthe result of his meditation was not satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\"Jowin,\" he resumed, after a pause, \"sing me a song.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you _are_ a queer codger,\" said Jarwin, laughing in spite of\r\nhimself; \"if ever there was a man as didn't feel up to singin', that's\r\nme at this moment.  Howsomedever, I 'spose it must be done.  Wot'll you\r\n'ave?  `Ben Bolt,' `Black-eyed Susan,' `The Jolly Young Waterman,' `Jim\r\nCrow,' `There is a Happy Land,' or the `Old Hundred,' eh?  Only say the\r\nword, an' I'll turn on the steam.\"\r\n\r\nBig Chief made no reply.  As he appeared to be lost in meditation,\r\nJarwin sat down, and in a species of desperation, began to bellow with\r\nall the strength of his lungs one of those nautical ditties with which\r\nseamen are wont to enliven the movements of the windlass or the capstan.\r\nHe changed the tune several times, and at length slid gradually into a\r\nmore gentle and melodious vein of song, while Big Chief listened with\r\nevident pleasure.  Still there was perceptible to Jarwin a dash of\r\nsadness in his master's countenance which he had never seen before.\r\nWondering at this, and changing his tunes to suit his own varying moods,\r\nhe gradually came to plaintive songs, and then to psalms and hymns.\r\n\r\nAt last Big Chief seemed satisfied, and bade his slave good-night.\r\n\r\n\"He's a wonderful c'racter,\" remarked Jarwin to Cuffy, as he lay down to\r\nrest that night, \"a most onaccountable sort o' man.  There's sumthin'\r\nworkin' in 'is 'ead; tho' wot it may be is more nor I can tell.  P'raps\r\nhe's agoin' to spiflicate me, in consikence o' my impidence.  If so,\r\nCuff, whatever will became o' you, my poor little doggie!\"\r\n\r\nCuffy nestled very close to his master's side at this point, and whined\r\nin a pitiful tone, as if he really understood the purport of his\r\nremarks.  In five minutes more he was giving vent to occasional mild\r\nlittle whines and half barks, indicating that he was in the land of\r\ndreams, and Jarwin's nose was creating sounds which told that its owner\r\nhad reached that blessed asylum of the weary--oblivion.\r\n\r\nNext day our sailor awakened to the consciousness of the fact that the\r\nsun was shining brightly, that paroquets were chattering gaily, that\r\nCuffy was still sleeping soundly, and that the subjects of Big Chief\r\nwere making an unusual uproar outside.\r\n\r\nStarting up, and pulling on a pair of remarkably ancient canvas\r\ntrousers, which his master had graciously permitted him to retain and\r\nwear, Jarwin looked out at the door of his hut and became aware of the\r\nfact that the whole tribe was assembled in the spot where national\r\n\"palavers\" were wont to be held.  The \"House\" appeared to be engaged at\r\nthe time in the discussion of some exceedingly knotty question--a sort\r\nof national education bill, or church endowment scheme--for there was\r\ngreat excitement, much gesticulation, and very loud talk, accompanied\r\nwith not a little angry demonstration on the part of the disputants.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! wot's up?\" inquired Jarwin of a stout savage who stood at his\r\ndoor armed with a club, on the head of which human teeth formed a\r\nconspicuous ornament.\r\n\r\n\"Palaver,\" replied the savage.\r\n\r\n\"It's easy to hear and see that,\" replied Jarwin, \"but wot is it all\r\nabout?\"\r\n\r\nThe savage vouchsafed no farther reply, but continued to march up and\r\ndown in front of the hut.\r\n\r\nJarwin, therefore, essayed to quit his abode, but was stopped by the\r\ntaciturn savage, who said that he must consider himself a prisoner until\r\nthe palaver had come to an end.  He was therefore fain to content\r\nhimself with standing at his door and watching the gesticulations of the\r\nmembers of council.\r\n\r\nBig Chief was there of course, and appeared to take a prominent part in\r\nthe proceedings.  But there were other chiefs of the tribe whose\r\nopinions had much weight, though they were inferior to him in position.\r\nAt last they appeared to agree, and finally, with a loud shout, the\r\nwhole band rushed off in the direction of the temple where their idols\r\nwere kept.\r\n\r\nJarwin's guard had manifested intense excitement during the closing\r\nscene, and when this last act took place he threw down his club, forsook\r\nhis post, and followed his comrades.  Of course Jarwin availed himself\r\nof the opportunity, and went to see what was being done.\r\n\r\nTo his great surprise he found that the temple was being dismantled,\r\nwhile the idols were carried down to the palaver-ground, if we may so\r\ncall it, and thrown into a heap there with marks of indignity and\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nKnowing, as he did, the superstitious reverence with which the natives\r\nregarded their idols, Jarwin beheld this state of things with intense\r\namazement, and he looked on with increasing interest, hoping, ere long,\r\nto discover some clue to the mystery, but his hopes were disappointed,\r\nfor Big Chief caught sight of him and sternly ordered him back to his\r\nhut, where another guard was placed over him.  This guard was more\r\nstrict than the previous one had been.  He would not allow his prisoner\r\neven to look on at what was taking place.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, there was therefore nothing for it but to fall\r\nback on philosophic meditation and converse with Cuffy.  These were\r\nrather poor resources, however, to a man who was surrounded by a tribe\r\nof excited savages.  Despite his natural courage and coolness, Jarwin\r\nfelt, as he said himself, \"raither oncomfortable.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the afternoon things became a little more quiet, still no notice\r\nwas taken of our hero save that his meals were sent to him from the\r\nChief's hut.  He wondered at this greatly, for nothing of the kind had\r\never happened before, and he began to entertain vague suspicions that\r\nsuch treatment might possibly be the prelude to evil of some kind\r\nbefalling him.  He questioned his guard several times, but that\r\nfunctionary told him that Big Chief had bidden him refuse to hold\r\nconverse with him on any subject whatever.\r\n\r\nBeing, as the reader knows, a practical, matter-of-fact sort of man, our\r\nhero at last resigned himself to his fate, whatever that might be, and\r\nbeguiled the time by making many shrewd remarks and observations to\r\nCuffy.  When the afternoon meal was brought to him, he heaved a deep\r\nsigh, and apparently, with that effort flung off all his anxieties.\r\n\r\n\"Come along, Cuff,\" he said in a hearty voice, sitting down to dinner,\r\n\"let's grub together an' be thankful for small mercies, anyhow.  Wotever\r\nturns up, you and I shall go halves and stick by one another to the\r\nlast.  Not that I have any doubts of Big Chief, Cuffy; you mustn't\r\nsuppose that; but then, you see, he ain't the only chief in the island,\r\nand if all the rest was to go agin him, _he_ couldn't do much to save\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nThe dog of course replied in its usual facetious manner with eyes and\r\ntail, and sat down with its ears cocked and its head turned expectantly\r\non one side, while the sailor removed the palm-leaf covering of the\r\nbasket which contained the provisions sent to him.\r\n\r\n\"Wot have we here, Cuffy?\" he said soliloquising and looking earnestly\r\nin; \"let me see; bit of baked pig--good, Cuff, good; that's the stuff to\r\nmake us fat.  Wot next?  Roast fish--that's not bad, Cuff--not bad,\r\nthough hardly equal to the pig.  Here we have a leaf full of plantains\r\nand another of yams,--excellent grub that, my doggie, nothing could be\r\nbetter.  What's this?  Cocoanut full of its own milk--the best o' drink;\r\n`it cheers'--as the old song, or the old poet says--`but it don't\r\ninebriate;' that wos said in regard to tea, you know, but it holds good\r\nin respect of cocoanut milk, and it's far better than grog, Cuffy; far\r\nbetter, though you can't know nothin' about that, but you may take my\r\nword for it; happy is the man as drinks nothin' stronger than cocoanut\r\nmilk or tea.  Hallo! wot's this--plums?  Why, doggie, they're oncommon\r\ngood to us to-day.  I wonder wot's up.  I say--\" Jarwin paused as he\r\ndrew the last dish out of the prolific basket, and looked earnestly at\r\nhis dog while he laid it down, \"I say, what if they should have taken it\r\ninto their heads to fatten us up before killin' us?  That's not a wery\r\nagreeable notion, is it, eh?\"\r\n\r\nApparently Cuffy was of the same opinion, for he did not wag even the\r\npoint of his tail, and there was something dubious in the glance of his\r\neye as he waited for more.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, it ain't no use surmisin',\" observed the seaman, with\r\nanother sigh, \"wot we've got for to do just now is to eat our wittles\r\nan' hope for the best.  Here you are, Cuff--catch!\"\r\n\r\nThrowing a lump of baked pig to his dog, the worthy man fell to with a\r\nkeen appetite, and gave himself no further anxiety as to the probable or\r\npossible events of the future.\r\n\r\nDinner concluded, he would fain have gone out for a ramble on the\r\nshore--as he had been wont to do in time past--but his gaoler forbade\r\nhim to quit the hut.  He was therefore about to console himself with a\r\nsiesta, when an unexpected order came from Big Chief, requiring his\r\nimmediate attendance in the royal hut.  Jarwin at once obeyed the\r\nmandate, and in a few minutes stood before his master, who was seated on\r\na raised couch, enjoying a cup of cocoanut milk.\r\n\r\n\"I have send for you,\" began Big Chief with solemnity, \"to have a\r\npalaver.  Sit down, you Breetish tar.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, old chap,\" replied Jarwin, seating himself on a stool\r\nopposite to his master.  \"Wot is it to be about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jowin,\" rejoined Big Chief, with deepening gravity, \"you's bin well\r\ntreated here.\"\r\n\r\nBig Chief spoke in broken English now, having picked it up with amazing\r\nfacility from his white slave.\r\n\r\n\"Well, y-e-es, I'm free to confess that I _has_ bin well treated--\r\nbarrin' the fact that my liberty's bin took away; besides which, some of\r\nyour black rascals ain't quite so civil as they might be, but on the\r\nwhole, I've been well treated; anyhow I never received nothin' but\r\nkindness from _you_, old codger.\"\r\n\r\nHe extended his hand frankly, and Big Chief, who had been taught the\r\nmeaning of our English method of salutation, grasped it warmly and shook\r\nit with such vigour that he would certainly have discomposed Jarwin had\r\nthat \"Breetish tar\" been a less powerful man.  He performed this\r\nceremony with the utmost sadness, however, and continued to shake his\r\nhead in such a melancholy way that his white slave began to feel quite\r\nanxious about him.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! old feller, you ain't bin took bad, have 'ee?\"\r\n\r\nBig Chief made no reply, but continued to shake his head slowly; then,\r\nas if a sudden idea had occurred to him, he rose, and, grasping Jarwin\r\nby his whiskers with both hands, rubbed noses with him, after which he\r\nresumed his seat on the couch.\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" observed our hero with a smile, \"you shake hands with me\r\nEnglish fashion--I rub noses with you South-Sea fashion.  Give an' take;\r\nall right, old codger--`may our friendship last for ever,' as the old\r\nsong puts it.  But wot about this here palaver you spoke of?  It warn't\r\nmerely to rub our beaks together that you sent for me, I fancy.  Is it a\r\nsong you wants, or a hymn?  Only say the word, and I'm your man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I s'pose,\" said Big Chief, using, of course, Jarwin's sea phraseology,\r\nonly still farther broken, \"you'd up ankar an' make sail most quick if\r\nyou could, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, although I _has_ a likin' for you, old man,\" replied the sailor,\r\n\"I can't but feel a sort o' preference, d'ee see, for my own wife an'\r\nchild'n.  There_fore_ I _would_ cut my cable, if I had the chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kite right, kite right,\" replied Big Chief, with a deep sigh, \"you say\r\nit am nat'ral.  Good, good, so 'tis.  Now, Jowin,\" continued the savage\r\nchief, with intense earnestness, \"you's free to go when you pleases.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, gammon!\" replied Jarwin, with an unbelieving grin.\r\n\r\n\"Wot _is_ gammon?\" demanded Big Chief, with a somewhat disappointed\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it don't matter what it means--it's nothin' or nonsense, if you\r\nlike--but wot do _you_ mean, old man, `that's the rub,' as Hamblet, or\r\nsome such c'racter, said to his father-in-law; you ain't in airnest, are\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jowin,\" answered the Chief, with immovable gravity, \"I not onderstan'\r\nyou.  Wot you mean by airnest?\"  He did not wait for a reply, however,\r\nbut seizing Jarwin by the wrist, and looking into his eyes with an\r\nexpression of child-like earnestness that effectually solemnised his\r\nwhite slave, continued, \"Lissen, onderstan' me.  I is a Christian.  My\r\nbroder chiefs an' I have watch you many days.  You have always do wot is\r\nright, no matter wot trouble follers to you.  You do this for love of\r\nyour God, your Saviour, so you tells me.  Good, I do not need much\r\npalaver.  Wen de sun shines it am hot; wen not shine am cold.  Wot more?\r\nCookee missionary have _say_ the truth.  My slave have _prove_ the\r\ntruth.  I love you, Jowin.  I love your God.  I keep you if possible,\r\nbut Christian must not have slave.  Go--you is free.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean _that_, old man?\" cried Jarwin, starting up with\r\nflashing eyes and seizing his master's hand.\r\n\r\n\"You is free!\" repeated Big Chief.\r\n\r\nWe need not relate all that honest John Jarwin said and did after that.\r\nLet it suffice to record his closing remarks that night to Cuffy.\r\n\r\n\"Cuff,\" said he, patting the shaggy head of his humble friend, \"many a\r\nstrange thing crops up in this here koorious world, but it never did\r\noccur to my mind before, that while a larned man like a missionary might\r\n_state_ the truth, the likes o' me should have the chance an' the power\r\nto _prove_ it.  That's a wery koorious fact, so you an' I shall go to\r\nsleep on it, my doggie--good-night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST.\r\n\r\nThat Jarwin's deliverance from slavery was not a dream, but a blessed\r\nreality, was proved to him next day beyond all doubt by the singular\r\nproceedings of Big Chief and his tribe.  Such of the native idols as had\r\nnot been burned on the previous day were brought out, collected into a\r\nheap, and publicly burned, after which the whole tribe assembled on the\r\npalavering ground, and Big Chief made a long, earnest, and animated\r\nspeech, in which he related all that he had seen of his white slave's\r\nconduct at the island of Raratonga, and stated how that conduct had\r\nproved to him, more conclusively than anything else he had heard or\r\nseen, that the religion of the white missionaries was true.\r\n\r\nWhile this was being spoken, many sage reflections were passing through\r\nJarwin's mind, and a feeling of solemn thankfulness filled him when he\r\nremembered how narrowly he had escaped doing inconceivable damage by\r\ngiving way to temptation and breaking his word.  He could not avoid\r\nperceiving that, if he had not been preserved in a course of rectitude\r\nall through his terrible trial, at a time when he thought that no one\r\nwas thinking about him, not only would Big Chief and his nation have\r\nprobably remained in heathen superstition, and continued to practise all\r\nthe horrid and bloody rites which that superstition involved, but his\r\nown condition of slavery would, in all probability, have been continued\r\nand rendered permanent; for Big Chief and his men were numerous and\r\npowerful enough to have held their own against the Raratongans, while,\r\nat the same time, it was probable that he would have lost his master's\r\nregard, as he would certainly have lost his respect.\r\n\r\nHe could not help reflecting, also, how much the cause of Christianity\r\nmust often suffer in consequence of the conduct of many seamen, calling\r\nthemselves Christians, who visit the South-Sea Islands, and lead\r\ndissolute, abandoned lives while there.  Some of these, he knew, brought\r\nthis discredit on the name of Jesus thoughtlessly, and would, perhaps,\r\nbe solemnised and sorry if they knew the terrible results of their\r\nconduct; while others, he also knew, cared nothing for Christianity, or\r\nfor anything in the world except the gratification of their own selfish\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nWhile he was yet pondering these things, Big Chief advanced towards him,\r\nand, taking him by the hand, led him into the centre of the concourse.\r\nTo his great surprise and confusion the tall chief said--\r\n\r\n\"Now, Jowin will palaver to you.  He is one Breetish tar--one Christian.\r\nHe can tell us what we shall do.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, Big Chief sat down, and left Jarwin standing in the midst\r\nscratching his head, and looking with extreme perplexity at the vast sea\r\nof black faces and glittering eyes which were directed towards him.\r\n\r\n\"W'y, you know, old man, it ain't fair of you, this ain't,\" he said,\r\naddressing himself to Big Chief; \"you've took me all aback, like a white\r\nsquall.  How d'ee s'pose that _I_ can tell 'ee wot to do?  I ain't a\r\nparson--no, not even a clerk, or a parish beadle!\"\r\n\r\nTo this Big Chief vouchsafed no further reply than--\"Palaver, you\r\nBreetish tar!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wery good,\" exclaimed Jarwin, turning round, and looking full at his\r\naudience, while a bright smile lit up his sunburnt countenance, as if a\r\nsudden idea had occurred to him, \"I'll do my best to palaver.  Here\r\ngoes, then, for a yarn.\"\r\n\r\nJarwin spoke, of course, in the native tongue, which we translate into\r\nhis own language.\r\n\r\n\"Big Chief, small chiefs, and niggers in general,\" he began, with a wave\r\nof his right hand, \"you've called on me for a speech.  Good.  I'm your\r\nman, I'm a `Breetish tar,' as your great chief says truly--that's a\r\nfact; an' I'm a Christian--I _hope_.  God knows, I've sometimes my own\r\ndoubts as to that same; but the doubts ain't with reference to the\r\nAlmighty; they're chiefly as regards myself.  Howsever, to come to the\r\npoint, you've gone and burnt your idols--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho!\" exclaimed the whole assembly, with a degree of energy that made a\r\ndeep impression on the sailor--just as one might be impressed when he\r\nhas been permitted to become the happy medium of achieving some great\r\nend which he had never dreamed of being privileged to accomplish.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" continued Jarwin, \"_that_ is a good thing, anyhow; for\r\nit's a disgrace to human natur', not to speak o' common-sense an' other\r\nthings, to worship stocks an' stones, w'en the Bible _distinctly_ tolls\r\n'ee not to do it.  You've done right in that matter; an' glad am I to\r\nhear from Big Chief that you intend, after this, to foller _the truth_.\r\nOld man, an' niggers,\" cried Jarwin, warming up, \"to my mind, the\r\nhighest thing that a man can dewot his-self to is, the follerin' out an'\r\nfallin' in with _the truth_.  Just s'pose that chemists, an' ingineers,\r\nan' doctors was to foller lies!  W'y, wot would come of it?  Confoosion\r\nwus confounded.  In coorse, therefore, they carefully _tries_ to foller\r\nwots _true_--though I'm bound for to say they _do_ git off the track now\r\nan' then.  Well, if it's so with such like, it's much more so with\r\nreligion.  Wot then?  W'y, stand by your colours, through thick an'\r\nthin.  Hold on to the Bible!  That's the watchword.  That's your\r\nsheet-anchor--though you haven't seed one yet.  It's good holdin' ground\r\nis the Bible--it's the _only_ holdin' ground.  `How does I know that?'\r\nsays you.  Well, it ain't easy for me to give you an off-hand answer to\r\nthat, any more than it is to give you an off-hand answer to a\r\ncomplicated question in the rule o' three.  A parson could do it, no\r\ndoubt, but the likes o' me can only show a sort o' reflected light like\r\nthe moon; nevertheless, we may show a true light--though reflected.\r\nChiefs an' niggers, there's asses in every generation (young asses\r\nchiefly) as thinks they've found out somethin' noo in regard to the\r\nBible, an' then runs it down.  An' them fellers grow old, an' sticks to\r\ntheir opinions; an' they think themselves wise, an' other people thinks\r\n'em wise 'cause they're old, as if oldness made 'em wise!  W'y are they\r\nasses?  W'y, because they formed their opinions _early_ in life, in\r\nopposition to men wot has studied these matters all through their lives.\r\nHavin' hoisted their colours, they nails 'em to the mast; an' there\r\nthey are!  They never goes at the investigation o' the subject as a man\r\ninvestigates mathematics, or navigation, or logarithms; so they're like\r\na ship at sea without a chart.  Niggers, no man can claim to be wise\r\nunless he can `render a reason.'  He _may_ be, p'raps, but he can't\r\n_claim_ to be.  _I_ believe the Bible's true because o' two facts.  Fust\r\nof all, men of the highest intellec' have found it true, an tried it,\r\nan' practised its teachin's, an' rested their souls on it.  In the\r\nsecond place, as the parsons say, _I_ have tried it, an' found it true\r\nas fur as I've gone.  I've sailed accordin to the chart, an' have struck\r\non no rocks or shoals as yet.  I've bin wery near it; but, thank God, I\r\nwasn't allowed to take the wrong course altogether, though I've got to\r\nconfess that I wanted to, many a time.  Now, wot does all this here come\r\nto?\" demanded Jarwin, gazing round on his audience, who were intensely\r\ninterested, though they did not understand much of what he said, \"wot\r\n_does_ it come to?  W'y that, havin' wisely given up yer idols, an'\r\ntaken to the true God, the next best thing you can do is to go off at\r\nonce to Raratonga, an' git the best adwice you can from those wot are\r\ntrained for to give it.  I can't say no fairer than that, for, as to\r\naskin' adwice on religious matters from the likes o' me, w'y the thing's\r\nparfitly ridiklous!\"\r\n\r\nJarwin sat down amid a murmur of applause.  In a few minutes an old\r\nchief rose to reply.  His words were to the effect that, although there\r\nwas much in their white brother's speech beyond their understanding--\r\nwhich was not to be wondered at, considering that he was so learned, and\r\nthey so ignorant--there was one part of it which he thoroughly agreed\r\nwith, namely, that a party should be sent to Raratonga to inform the\r\nCookee missionaries as to what had taken place, to ask advice, and to\r\nbeg one of the Cookees to come and live permanently on their island, and\r\nteach them the Christian religion.  Another chief followed with words\r\nand sentiments to much the same effect.  Then Big Chief gave orders that\r\nthe canoes for the deputation should be got ready without delay, and the\r\nmeeting broke up with loud shouts and other pleasant demonstrations.\r\n\r\nMatters having been thus satisfactorily arranged, Jarwin returned to his\r\nhut with a grateful heart, to meditate on the happy turn that had taken\r\nplace in his prospects.  Finding the hut not quite congenial to his\r\nframe of mind, and observing that the day was unusually fine, he\r\nresolved to ramble in the cool shades of a neighbouring wood.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Cuff, my doggie, you an' I shall go for a walk this fine day;\r\nwe've much to think about an' talk over, d'ee see, which is best done in\r\nsolitary places.\"\r\n\r\nNeed we say that Cuffy responded with intense enthusiasm to this\r\ninvitation, and that his \"spanker boom\" became violently demonstrative\r\nas he followed his master into the wood.\r\n\r\nJarwin still wore, as we have said, his old canvas trousers, which had\r\nbeen patched and re-patched to such an extent with native cloth, that\r\nvery little of the original fabric was visible.  The same may be said of\r\nhis old flannel shirt, to which he clung with affectionate regard long\r\nafter it had ceased to be capable of clinging to him without patchwork\r\nstrengthening.  The remnants of his straw hat, also, had been carefully\r\nkept together, so that, with the exception of the paint on his face,\r\nwhich Big Chief insisted on his wearing, and the huge South-Sea club\r\nwhich he carried habitually for protection, he was still a fair specimen\r\nof a British tar.\r\n\r\nParoquets were chattering happily; rills were trickling down the\r\nhillsides; fruit and flower trees perfumed the air, and everything\r\nlooked bright and beautiful--in pleasant accordance with the state of\r\nJarwin's feelings--while the two friends wandered away through the woods\r\nin dreamy enjoyment of the past and present, and with hopeful\r\nanticipations in regard to the future.  Jarwin said something to this\r\neffect to Cuffy, and put it to him seriously to admit the truth of what\r\nhe said, which that wise dog did at once--if there be any truth in the\r\nold saying that \"silence is consent.\"\r\n\r\nAfter wandering for several hours, they came out of the wood at a part\r\nof the coast which lay several miles distant from Big Chief's village.\r\nHere, to his surprise and alarm, he discovered two war-canoes in the act\r\nof running on the beach.  He drew back at once, and endeavoured to\r\nconceal himself, for he knew too well that this was a party from a\r\ndistant island, the principal chief of which had threatened more than\r\nonce to make an attack on Big Chief and his tribe.  But Jarwin had been\r\nobserved, and was immediately pursued and his retreat cut off by\r\nhundreds of yelling savages.  Seeing this, he ran down to the beach,\r\nand, taking up a position on a narrow spit of sand, flourished his\r\nponderous club and stood at bay.  Cuffy placed himself close behind his\r\nmaster, and, glaring between his legs at the approaching savages,\r\ndisplayed all his teeth and snarled fiercely.  One, who appeared to be a\r\nchief, ran straight at our hero, brandishing a club similar to his own.\r\nJarwin had become by that time well practised in the use of his weapon;\r\nhe evaded the blow dealt at him, and fetched the savage such a whack on\r\nthe small of his back as he passed him, that he fell flat on the sand\r\nand lay there.  Cuffy rushed at him and seized him by the throat, an act\r\nwhich induced another savage to launch a javelin at the dog.  It grazed\r\nhis back, cut it partly open, and sent him yelling into the woods.\r\nMeanwhile, Jarwin was surrounded, and, although he felled three or four\r\nof his assailants, was quickly overpowered by numbers, gagged, lashed\r\ntight to a pole, so that he could not move, and laid in the bottom of\r\none of the war-canoes.\r\n\r\nEven when in this sad plight the sturdy seaman did not lose heart, for\r\nhe knew well that Cuffy being wounded and driven from his master's side,\r\nwould run straight home to his master's hut, and that Big Chief would at\r\nonce suspect, from the nature of the wound and the circumstance of the\r\ndog being alone, that it was necessary for him and his men-of-war to\r\ntake the field; Jarwin, therefore, felt very hopeful that he should be\r\nspeedily rescued.  But such hopes were quickly dispelled when, after a\r\nnoisy dispute on the beach, the savages, who owned the canoe in which he\r\nlay, suddenly re-embarked and pushed off to sea, leaving the other canoe\r\nand its crew on the beach.\r\n\r\nHour after hour passed, but the canoe-men did did not relax their\r\nefforts.  Straight out to sea they went, and when the sun set, Big\r\nChief's island had already sunk beneath the horizon.\r\n\r\nNow, indeed, a species of wild despair filled the breast of the poor\r\ncaptive.  To be thus seized, and doomed in all probability to perpetual\r\nbondage, when the cup of regained liberty had only just touched his\r\nlips, was very hard to bear.  When he first fully realised his\r\nsituation, he struggled fiercely to burst his bonds, but the men who had\r\ntied him knew how to do their work.  He struggled vainly until he was\r\nexhausted.  Then, looking up into the starry sky, his mind became\r\ngradually composed, and he had recourse to prayer.  Slumber ere long\r\nsealed his eyes, setting him free in imagination, and he did not again\r\nwaken until daylight was beginning to appear.\r\n\r\nAll that day he lay in the same position, without water or food, cramped\r\nby the cords that bound him, and almost driven mad by the heat of an\r\nunclouded sun.  Still, onward went the canoe--propelled by men who\r\nappeared to require no rest.  Night came again, and Jarwin--by that time\r\nnearly exhausted--fell into a troubled slumber.  From this he was\r\nsuddenly aroused by loud wild cries and shouts, as of men engaged in\r\ndeadly conflict, and he became aware of the fact that the canoe in which\r\nhe lay was attacked, for the warriors had thrown down their paddles and\r\nseized their clubs, and their feet trod now on his chest, now on his\r\nface, as they staggered to and fro.  In a few minutes several dead and\r\nwounded men fell on him; then he became unconscious.\r\n\r\nWhen John Jarwin's powers of observation returned, he found himself\r\nlying on his back in a neat little bed, with white cotton curtains, in a\r\nsmall, comfortably-furnished room, that reminded him powerfully of home!\r\nCuffy lay on the counterpane, sound asleep, with his chin on his\r\nmaster's breast.  At the bedside, with her back to him, sat a female,\r\ndressed in European clothes, and busy sewing.\r\n\r\n\"Surely it ain't bin all a long dream!\" whispered Jarwin to himself.\r\n\r\nCuffy cocked his ears and head, and turned a furtive glance on his\r\nmaster's face, while his \"spanker boom\" rose with the evident intention\r\nto wag, if circumstances rendered it advisable; but circumstances had of\r\nlate been rather perplexing to Cuffy.  At the same time the female\r\nturned quickly round and revealed a brown, though pleasant, face.\r\nSimultaneously, a gigantic figure arose at his side and bent over him.\r\n\r\n\"You's bedder?\" said the gigantic figure.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!  Big Chief!  Wot's up, old feller?\" exclaimed Jarwin.\r\n\r\n\"Hold you's tongue!\" said Big Chief, sternly.  \"Go way,\" he added, to\r\nthe female, who, with an acquiescent smile, left the room.\r\n\r\n\"Well, this _is_ queer; an' I feels queer.  Queery--wots the meanin' of\r\nit?\" asked Jarwin.\r\n\r\n\"You's bin bad, Jowin,\" answered Big Chief, gravely, \"wery bad.  Dead\r\na-most.  Now, you's goin' to be bedder.  Doctor say that--\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor!\" exclaimed Jarwin in surprise, \"_what_ doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor of ship.  Hims come ebbery day for to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ship!\" cried Jarwin, springing up in his bed and glaring at Big Chief\r\nin wonder.\r\n\r\n\"Lie down, you Christian Breetish tar,\" said the Chief, sternly, at the\r\nsame time laying his large hand on the sailor's chest with a degree of\r\nforce that rendered resistance useless.  \"Hold you's tongue an' listen.\r\nDoctor say you not for speak.  Me tell you all about it.\r\n\r\n\"Fust place,\" continued Big Chief, \"you's bin bad, konsikince of de\r\nblackguard's havin' jump on you's face an' stummick.  But we give 'em\r\nawful lickin', Jowin--oh! smash um down right and left; got you out de\r\ncanoe--dead, I think, but no, not jus' so.  Bring you here--Raratonga.\r\nDe Cookee missionary an' his wife not here; away in ship you sees im\r\nmake.  Native teecher here.  Dat teecher's wife bin nurse you an' go\r\naway jus' now.  Ship comes here for trade, bound for England.  Ams got\r\ndoctor.  Doctor come see you, shake ums head; looks long time; say he\r\nput you `all right.'  Four week since dat.  Now, you's hall right?\"\r\n\r\nThe last words he uttered with much anxiety depicted on his countenance,\r\nfor he had been so often deceived of late by Jarwin having occasional\r\nlucid intervals in the midst of his delirium, that his faith in him had\r\nbeen shaken.\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" exclaimed Jarwin, \"aye, right as a trivet.  Bound for\r\nEngland, did 'ee say--the ship?\"\r\n\r\nBig Chief nodded and looked very sad.  \"You go home?\" he asked, softly.\r\n\r\nJarwin was deeply touched, he seized the big man's hand, and, not being\r\nstrong, failed to restrain a tear or two.  Big Chief, being _very_\r\nstrong--in feelings as well as in frame--burst into tears.  Cuffy, being\r\nutterly incapable of making head or tail of it, gave vent to a\r\nprolonged, dismal howl, which changed to a bark and whine of\r\nsatisfaction when his master laughed, patted him, and advised him not to\r\nbe so free in the use of his \"spanker boom!\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFour weeks later, and Jarwin, with Cuffy by his side, stood, \"himself\r\nagain,\" on the quarterdeck of the _Nancy_ of Hull, while the \"Yo, heave\r\nho!\" of the sailors rang an accompaniment to the clatter of the windlass\r\nas they weighed anchor, Big Chief held his hand and wept, and rubbed\r\nnoses with him--to such an extent that the cabin boy said it was a\r\nperfect miracle that they had a scrap of nose left on their faces--and\r\nwould not be consoled by the assurance that he, Jarwin, would certainly\r\nmake another voyage to the South Seas, if he should be spared to do so,\r\nand occasion offered, for the express purpose of paying him a visit.  At\r\nlast he tore himself away, got into his canoe, and remained gazing in\r\nspeechless sorrow after the homeward-bound vessel as she shook out her\r\ntopsails to the breeze.\r\n\r\nDespite his efforts, poor Jarwin was so visibly affected at parting from\r\nhis kind old master, that the steward of the ship, a sympathetic man,\r\nwas induced to offer him a glass of grog and a pipe.  He accepted both,\r\nmechanically, still gazing with earnest looks at the fast-receding\r\ncanoe.\r\n\r\nPresently he raised the glass to his lips, and his nose became aware of\r\nthe long-forgotten odour!  The current of his thoughts was violently\r\nchanged.  He looked intently at the glass and then at the pipe.\r\n\r\n\"Drink,\" said the sympathetic steward, \"and take a whiff.  It'll do you\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Drink! whiff!\" exclaimed Jarwin, while a dark frown gathered on his\r\nbrow.  \"There, old Father Neptune,\" he cried, tossing the glass and pipe\r\noverboard, \"_you_ drink and whiff, if you choose; John Jarwin has done\r\nwi' drinkin' an' whiffin' for ever!  Thanks to _you_, all the same, an'\r\nno offence meant,\" he added in a gentler tone, turning to the astonished\r\nsteward, and patting him on the shoulder, \"but if you had suffered all\r\nthat I have suffered through bein' a slave to the glass and the pipe--\r\nwhen I _thought_ I was no slave, mark you, an' would have larfed any one\r\nto scorn who'd said I wos--if you'd see'd me groanin', an yearnin', an'\r\ndreamin' of baccy an' grog, as I _have_ done w'en I couldn't get neither\r\nof 'em for love or money--you wouldn't wonder that I ain't goin' to be\r\nsuch a born fool as to go an' sell myself over again!\"\r\n\r\nTurning quickly towards the shore, as if regretting that he should, for\r\na moment, have appeared to forget his old friend, he pulled out his\r\nhandkerchief and waved it over the side.  Big Chief replied\r\nenergetically with a scrap of native cloth--not having got the length of\r\nhandkerchiefs at that time.\r\n\r\n\"Look at 'im, Cuff\" exclaimed Jarwin, placing his dog on the bulwarks of\r\nthe ship, \"look at him, Cuff, and wag your `spanker boom' to him, too--\r\nay, that's right--for he's as kind-hearted a nigger as ever owned a\r\nBreetish tar for a slave.\"\r\n\r\nHe said no more, but continued to wave his handkerchief at intervals\r\nuntil the canoe seemed a mere speck on the horizon, and, after it was\r\ngone, he and his little dog continued to gaze sadly at the island, as it\r\ngrew fainter and fainter, until it sank at last into the great bosom of\r\nthe Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe next land seen by Jarwin and Cuffy was--the white cliffs of Old\r\nEngland!",
