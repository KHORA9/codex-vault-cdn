Such a question can hardly be answered\r\nuntil we have examined rivers in many parts of the world, gaining\r\nmaterial for a general history of rivers by induction from as large as\r\npossible a variety of examples; and until we have deduced from our\r\ngeneralizations a series of critical features sufficient to serve for\r\nthe detection of rivers of different kinds wherever found.\r\n\r\nThe generalizations here referred to may be presented in the form of a\r\nclassification, following the ideas of Powell, Gilbert, Heim, Löwl and\r\nothers, as follows:\r\n\r\n_Consequent rivers_.--Those that have in their birth, at the time of\r\ntheir original establishment on the country which they drain, selected\r\ncourses in accordance with the constructional slopes of the surface;\r\nfor example, the Red River of the North and such of its branches as\r\nflow on the even surface of the lacustrine plain of Lake Agassiz; the\r\nseveral streams that drain the broken lava blocks of Southern Oregon;\r\ncertain streams and rivers of the Jura that drain the synclinal troughs\r\nof those mountains. Consequent streams may be divided into definite and\r\nindefinite groups. Definite consequent streams are those that follow\r\nwell defined constructional channels, such as the axial line of a\r\nsynclinal trough, or the lowest point of an anticlinal arch between two\r\nsynclinal basins; they are defined in location as well as in direction.\r\nIndefinite consequent streams are those that flow down constructional\r\nslopes, such as the flanks of an anticline, but whose precise location\r\ndepends on those minor inequalities of surface that we term accidental;\r\nthey are defined in direction but not in location; and they are as a\r\nrule branches of definite consequent streams.\r\n\r\n_Antecedent rivers_.--Those that during and for a time after a\r\ndisturbance of their drainage area maintain the courses that they had\r\ntaken before the disturbance. In Powell's original definition of this\r\nclass of rivers, he said that the valleys of the Uinta mountains are\r\noccupied by \"drainage that was established antecedent to the\r\ncorrugation or displacement of the beds by faulting or folding.\"[1] No\r\nlimit is set to the amount of corrugation or displacement or to the\r\nstrength of the faulting or folding. It therefore seems advisable to\r\nconsider what variations there may be from the strongly marked\r\nantecedent type; one extreme being in those cases where the\r\ndisplacement was a minimum and the perseverance of the streams a\r\nmaximum, the other where the displacement was a maximum and the\r\nsuccessful perseverance of the streams a minimum, or zero. The simplest\r\nexamples of antecedent rivers are therefore found in regions that have\r\nbeen broadly elevated with the gentlest changes of slope, so as to\r\nenter a new cycle of topographic development, all the streams retaining\r\ntheir previous courses, but gaining ability to deepen their former\r\nchannels down to the new baselevel; such streams may be called\r\n\"revived.\" Examples of revived streams are very common; nearly all the\r\nstreams of the Highlands of New Jersey are of this kind; all the\r\nstreams of central and western Pennsylvania seem to belong in the same\r\nclass. From these simple and common examples, we shall some day, when\r\nour knowledge of rivers is better developed, be able to form a complete\r\nseries leading to what is generally understood as the typical\r\nantecedent river, which has outlived deformation as well as elevation\r\nwithout suffering either deflection or ponding. Large rivers of strong\r\nslope, well enclosed in steep-sided valleys, or in other words vigorous\r\nadolescent rivers have the best opportunity to persist across a belt of\r\nrising or writhing country,[2] because a great deformation would be\r\nrequired to throw them from their courses. Small streams or large ones\r\nof faint slope in an open low country are more easily deflected. From\r\nthe typical antecedent river, the series may be continued by examples\r\nin which even the larger streams are less or more ponded or deflected\r\nby the deformation, until at the end of the series there is a complete\r\nextinction of the antecedent drainage and the establishment of an\r\nentirely original consequent drainage. The perfectly typical antecedent\r\nriver, in the middle of this series, is certainly of rare occurrence,\r\nand is perhaps unknown.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Colorado river of the West, 163.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Stur's expression \"Gebirgshub oder Gebirgschub\" suggested\r\nto me the terms here employed.]\r\n\r\nConsequent streams, whose course is taken on a relatively thin,\r\nunconformably overlying mass, for a time preserve their initial\r\ncourses, even though they may be quite out of accord with the\r\nunderlying structures on which they have descended. Such streams were\r\nfirst recognized by Marvine, and afterwards named \"superimposed,\"\r\n\"inherited\" or \"epigenetic\" by various authors. A full collection of\r\nexamples of this class should begin with streams that depart from true\r\nconsequent courses only locally, where they have discovered a small\r\nportion of the underlying formation, like the Merrimack at Manchester\r\nand other water-power towns of New Hampshire, where the stream has sunk\r\nupon rocky ledges beneath the surface drift and sands; or like the\r\nMississippi and other rivers in Minnesota which have in places cut\r\nthrough the drift sheet to the underlying crystallines. The series\r\nwould conclude with streams that have stripped off the cover on which\r\nthey were consequent, and have thus become superimposed on the\r\nunderlying formation in their whole length.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious intermediate type of drainage lately recognized by\r\nMcGee in the southern states, a superimposed drainage that is not\r\ninconsequent upon the buried surface beneath the unconformably\r\noverlying surface layer. It occurs in regions where a well-marked\r\ndrainage had been established; a brief submergence then allowed the\r\ndeposition of a relatively thin mask of sediments; an elevation brought\r\nthe masked surface up again, and as it rose, the streams took\r\npossession of lines essentially identical with the courses of their\r\nancestors, because the mask of newer deposits had not extinguished the\r\nantecedent topography. McGee proposes to call such streams\r\n\"resurrected.\"\r\n\r\nRivers of all classes as a rule develop during their adolescence and\r\nmore mature growth certain \"subsequent\" branches that were not in any\r\nway represented in the early youth of the system. Thus the indefinite\r\nmembers of the consequent drainage of the Jura mountains have developed\r\nsubsequent streams on soft beds of monoclinal and anticlinal\r\nstructures, where there could not possibly have been any consequent\r\ndrainage lines at the birth of this system, unless we admit the\r\nsupposed fracturing of the anticlinal crests, which seems unnecessary\r\nto say the least. Even in the simplest style of drainage, growing on a\r\nlevel surface, many of the branches must be \"subsequent,\" or as McGee\r\nhas called them in such cases, \"autogenetic.\"\r\n\r\nRivers of all classes are subject to spontaneous re-arrangement or\r\nadjustment of their courses to a greater or less extent, in accordance\r\nwith the weaker structural lines. This results from the migration of\r\ndivides and the consequent abstraction or capture of one stream by\r\nanother. The capture is generally made by the headward development of\r\nsome subsequent branch. But after this kind of change has advanced to a\r\ncertain extent, the divides become stable, and further change ceases.\r\nThe rivers may then be said to be maturely adjusted. Under certain\r\nconditions, chiefly great initial altitude of surface, and great\r\ndiversity of structure, that is, in mountainous regions, the changes\r\narising from adjustments of this spontaneous kind are very great, so\r\nthat the courses of a river's middle age may have little resemblance to\r\nthose of its youth, as Löwl has pointed out and as I have tried to show\r\nin the case of the Pennsylvanian rivers. It may be difficult to\r\nrecognize in such cases whether the youthful courses of a river system\r\nwere consequent, antecedent or superimposed. Adjustments of this kind\r\nwere not discussed by Powell, although he makes brief mention of what I\r\nhave called subsequent streams. The first appreciation that I gained of\r\nriver adjustments came from the writings of Löwl; but I have since\r\nfound that the general principles governing their opportunity were\r\nstated by Gilbert in his monograph on the Henry Mountains of Utah (pp.\r\n141, 149), and by Heim in his Mechanismus der Gebirgsbildung (i, 272,\r\netc., ii, 79, 320).\r\n\r\nWhere do the rivers of northern New Jersey stand in this general scheme\r\nof river classification? We must again postpone the answer to the\r\nquestion, while reviewing the history of the general geographical\r\ndevelopment of the region.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The more detailed statement of this history may be found\r\nin an essay prepared by the author with the collaboration of Mr. J. W.\r\nWood, Jr., of the class of 1888 in Harvard College, the study being\r\nundertaken as a joint thesis by instructor and student in a second\r\ncourse in Physical Geography. The essay is published in the Proceedings\r\nof the Boston Society of Natural History, 1889.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe topography of northern New Jersey may be briefly described as made\r\nup of valleys and lowlands that have been etched in the now elevated\r\nsurface of what may be called the Schooley peneplain on the Cretaceous\r\nbaselevel. The topographical atlas of New Jersey should be constantly\r\nreferred to, in order to follow such a statement as this; but in order\r\nthat the reader may without undue difficulty apprehend the meaning of\r\nmy descriptions and recognize the various localities yet to be named\r\nwithout the trouble of searching for them on the maps of the atlas, I\r\nhave attempted to draw a generalized bird's eye view of northern New\r\nJersey, as it would be seen by an observer about seventy miles\r\nvertically above the center of southern New Jersey. The meridians are\r\nvertical and east and west lines are horizontal, but oblique azimuths\r\nare foreshortened. The result is hardly more than a geographical\r\ncaricature, and I publish it in part to experiment upon the usefulness\r\nof so imperfect an effort. An active imagination may perceive the long\r\neven crest line of Kittatinny Mountain on the northwest, rising beyond\r\nthe rolling floor of the Kittatinny Valley, as the great Alleghany\r\nlimestone lowland is here called; then come the Highland plateaus, of\r\naccordant altitude one with another, but without the mesa-like margin\r\nthat my pen has not known how to avoid indicating. The Central plain\r\nlies in the foreground, diversified by the various trap ridges that\r\nrise above its surface; First and Second mountains of the double\r\nWatchung crescent near the Highlands; Sourland Mountain in the\r\nsouthwest; and Rocky Hill, the southwestern re-appearance of the\r\nPalisades intrusive trap sheet, lying a little nearer to us. The\r\nCentral plain is also diversified by the Fall-line, a slight but rather\r\ndistinct break in its surface from Trenton (Tr.) on the Delaware to a\r\nlittle below New Brunswick (N. B.) on the Raritan. The important\r\ndrainage lines are: the Delaware, forming the western boundary of the\r\nState, trenching Kittatinny Mountain at the Water Gap, cutting a deep\r\ntransverse valley through the Highlands where it receives longitudinal\r\nbranches, and a shallower trench across the Kittatinny lowland and the\r\nCentral plain; the Raritan, whose north and south branches head in the\r\nHighlands, while the Millstone joins it from south of the fall-line,\r\ncutting through Rocky Hill near Princeton (Pr.) on the way; and the\r\nPequannock-Passaic, rising in the Highlands, gathering tributaries in\r\nthe low basin behind the Watchung ridges, and escaping to the front\r\ncountry as a single stream, the Passaic, through deep gaps at\r\nPatterson. The terminal moraine, marking the furthest advance of the\r\nsecond glacial invasion of post-tertiary time, is indicated by an\r\nirregular dotted band crossing the State, from the Narrows of New York\r\nBay, which it defines, on the east, passing over Second Mountain by the\r\ngap at Summit (S), rising midway in the Highlands over Schooley\r\nMountain, and traversed by the Delaware at Belvidere (B).\r\n\r\nThe Schooley peneplain is indicated by the crest and summit altitudes\r\nof Kittatinny Mountain, the Highland plateaus and the trap ridges. This\r\npeneplain once lay low and essentially horizontal, the practically\r\ncompleted work of the processes of denudation acting on a previously\r\nhigh land through a long period of time: it is now lifted and tilted,\r\nso that its inland portion rises to the height of the Highlands, which\r\nare its remnants, while its seaward portion descends slowly beneath a\r\ncover of unconformable Cretaceous beds, southeast of the fall-line, and\r\nthus hidden sinks gently beneath the Atlantic shore. The cover of\r\nCretaceous sediments was laid on the southeastern part of the old\r\npeneplain during a moderate submergence of its seaward portion, before\r\nthe elevation and tilting above mentioned (fig. 2, below). Much of the\r\ncover has been worn away since the time of elevation (figs. 3-6,\r\nbelow), which gave opportunity for the opening of deep valleys on the\r\nsoft limestones and slates among the hard crystalline rocks of the\r\nHighlands; and for the production of the broad Kittatinny Valley\r\nlowland or peneplain on the wide belt of limestones beyond the\r\nHighlands; and furthermore for the development of a broad baselevelled\r\nplain on the weak Triassic shales and sandstones, where the old\r\npeneplain has been almost entirely destroyed. The Cretaceous cover\r\nremains only near the coast, where it stood too low to be attacked\r\nwhile the valleys and lowlands just described were carved out. An\r\ninteresting peculiarity in the relation between the newer baselevel\r\nplain on the Triassic area and the old Cretaceous peneplain is that\r\ntheir surfaces mutually intersect at a small angle along the line which\r\nnow marks the visible contact between the Triassic and Cretaceous\r\nformations: the newer plain standing beneath the eroded portion of the\r\nolder one northwest of this line, while it rises above the buried part\r\nof the older one and obliquely truncates its Cretaceous cover to the\r\nsoutheast of the line. Finally, the land as a whole has been raised a\r\nlittle since the making of the newer plain, and shallow valleys\r\ninterrupt its broad surface. It is no longer a true plain; it has\r\nbecome a pastplain. A few words may be allowed me concerning these\r\nterms, peneplain and pastplain. Given sufficient time for the action of\r\ndenuding forces on a mass of land standing fixed with reference to a\r\nconstant baselevel, and it must be worn down so low and so smooth, that\r\nit would fully deserve the name of plain. But it is very unusual for a\r\nmass of land to maintain a fixed position as long as is here assumed.\r\nMany instances might be quoted of regions which have stood still so\r\nlong that their surface is almost reduced to its ultimate form; but the\r\ntruly ultimate stage is seldom reached. We can select regions in which\r\nthe valley lowlands have become broad and flat, the intermediate \"doab\"\r\nhills have wasted away lower and lower until they are reduced to forms\r\nof insignificant relief; and yet the surface still does not deserve the\r\nname of plain as unqualifiedly as do those young lands newly born from\r\nseas or lakes in which their geometrically level surfaces were formed.\r\nI have therefore elsewhere suggested[4] that an old region, nearly\r\nbaselevelled, should be called an almost-plain; that is, a peneplain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Amer. Jour. Sci., xxxvii, 1889, 430.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, an old baselevelled region, either a peneplain or a\r\ntruly ultimate plain, will, when thrown by elevation into a new cycle\r\nof development, depart by greater and greater degrees from its simple\r\nfeatureless form, as young narrow valleys are sunk beneath its surface\r\nby its revived streams. It therefore no longer fully deserves the name\r\nthat was properly applicable before its elevation. It must not again be\r\ncalled a peneplain, for it is now not approaching and almost attaining\r\na smooth surface, but is becoming rougher and rougher. It has passed\r\nbeyond the stage of minimum relief, and this significant fact deserves\r\nimplication, at least, in a name. I would therefore call such a region\r\na pastplain. The area of the weak Triassic shales was, until its late\r\nelevation, as good an example of an ultimate baselevelled plain as any\r\nthat I have found; but now it is a pastplain, as any one may see while\r\ntraveling across it on the train: its doabs are broad and continuous,\r\nand its valleys are relatively narrow and shallow. The Kittatinny\r\nlowland is intersected by streams whose valleys sink below its\r\ngenerally even, gently rolling surface; but it was never so smooth as\r\nthe Triassic plain. It was only a peneplain, and it is now a roughened\r\npeneplain. Perhaps the more adventurous terminologist will call it a\r\npast-peneplain; but I dare not venture quite so far as that. When the\r\nHighlands were lowlands, their surface well deserved the name of\r\npeneplain; but they were lifted so long ago into so high a position\r\nthat they are now cut into a complicated mass of rugged uplands. They\r\nno longer deserve the name of peneplain; and if in preceding paragraphs\r\nI have referred to them as constituting an old peneplain, it is because\r\nno satisfactory name has yet been applied to the particular stage of\r\ndevelopment of plains and plateaus in which they now stand. Having\r\ntried in vain to invent a term with which to name the Highlands, let me\r\nnow advertise for one in the pages of our Magazine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWANTED: a name applicable to those broken, rugged regions that have\r\nbeen developed by the normal processes of denudation from the once\r\ncontinuous surface of a plain or peneplain. The name should be if\r\npossible homologous with the words, _plain_, _peneplain_ and\r\n_pastplain_; it should be of simple, convenient and euphonious form; it\r\nmust be satisfactory to many other persons than its inventor; and its\r\netymological construction should not be embarrassed by the attempt to\r\ncrowd too much meaning into it. The mere suggestion that it was once a\r\nplain and that it is now maturely diversified will suffice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe topography of northern New Jersey is therefore, like its structure,\r\npolygenetic. It exhibits very clearly a series of forms developed under\r\nthree different geographic cycles, and closer search will doubtless\r\ndiscover forms belonging to yet other cycles, less complete and of\r\nbriefer duration than these three. There is the tilted and deeply\r\neroded peneplain of the Highlands, whose initial form may be called the\r\nSchooley peneplain, from the distinct exhibition of one of its remnants\r\non Schooley's mountain; this was the product of Jurassic and Cretaceous\r\ndenudation. There is the younger central baselevelled plain, developed\r\nduring Tertiary time, or thereabouts, on the weaker Triassic and\r\nCretaceous beds; and the associated valleys of the same age that have\r\nbeen sunk into the weakest rocks of the Highlands. There are the\r\nshallow valleys in the Central plain, of the latest post-tertiary\r\ncycle, requiring the name of this region to be changed from plain, as\r\nit was lately, to pastplain, as it is now. The first cycle, in which\r\nthe Schooley peneplain was produced, witnessed the accomplishment of a\r\ngreat work; it included in its later part, besides various other\r\noscillations, the sub-cycle when the seaward or southeastern part of\r\nthe peneplain was gently submerged and buried to a slight depth under\r\nCretaceous deposits. The second cycle was shorter; being a time\r\nsufficient to baselevel the softer beds, but not seriously to consume\r\nthe harder parts of the pre-existing surface. We are still in the third\r\ncycle, of which but a small part has elapsed. The question with which\r\nthis essay opened may now be taken up.\r\n\r\nThe streams and rivers of northern New Jersey may be examined, with the\r\nintention of classifying them according to their conditions of origin,\r\nto their degree of complexity as indicated by the number of geographic\r\ncycles through which they have lived, and to the advance made toward\r\ntheir mature adjustment.\r\n\r\nThe Musconetcong may be taken as the type of the Highland streams. It\r\nflows southwestward along a narrow limestone valley between crystalline\r\nplateaus on either side, entering the Delaware a little below Easton,\r\nPa., (E, fig. 1). It drains a country that has been enormously denuded,\r\nand during the Jura-Cretaceous cycle of this deep denudation, there\r\nmust have been time for it and its fellows to become thoroughly\r\nadjusted to the structure of the region; it must be chiefly for this\r\nreason that it flows so closely along the weak limestone belt, and has\r\nits divides close by on the adjoining harder crystallines, (M, fig. 2).\r\nWhatever its origin, it has lost every initial feature that was\r\ndiscordant with the deep structures that it discovered beneath the\r\ninitial surface; it is maturely adjusted to its environment. It endured\r\nto an old age during the baselevelling of the Schooley peneplain, and\r\nis now a \"revived\" stream, in at least its second cycle of work. Most\r\nof the other streams of the Highlands and the country farther inland\r\nare also of this well adjusted, revived kind. The streams of the\r\nKittatinny valley lowland show not only the first revival of the kind\r\njust described, but also a second revival, in consequence of the recent\r\nuplift that has introduced the third cycle of development; this not\r\nbeing so clearly manifested in the Highlands, where the rocks are\r\nharder, and the valleys of the second cycle are narrower.\r\n\r\nLook now at the drainage of the crescentic Watchung mountains; the\r\ncurved edges of two great warped lava-flows of the Triassic belt. The\r\nnoteworthy feature of this district is that the small streams in the\r\nsouthern part of the crescent rise on the back slope of the inner\r\nmountain and cut gaps in both mountains in order to reach the outer\r\npart of the Central Plain. If these streams were descended directly or\r\nby revival from ancestors antecedent to or consequent upon the\r\nmonoclinal tilting of the Triassic formation, they could not possibly,\r\nin the long time and deep denudation that the region has endured, have\r\ndown to the present time maintained courses so little adjusted to the\r\nstructure of their basins. In so long a time as has elapsed since the\r\ntilting of the Triassic formation, the divides would have taken their\r\nplaces on the crest of the trap ridges and not behind the crest on the\r\nback slope. They cannot be subsequent streams, for such could not have\r\npushed their sources headwards through a hard trap ridge. Subsequent\r\nstreams are developed in accordance with structural details, not in\r\nviolation of them. Their courses must have been taken _not long ago_,\r\nelse they must surely have lost their heads back of the second\r\nmountain; some piratical subsequent branch of a larger transverse\r\nstream, like the Passaic, would have beheaded them.\r\n\r\nThe only method now known by which these several doubly transverse\r\nstreams could have been established in the not too distant past, is by\r\nsuperimposition from the Cretaceous cover that was laid upon the old\r\nSchooley peneplain. It has already been stated that when the Highlands\r\nand this region together had been nearly baselevelled, the coastal\r\nportion of the resulting peneplain was submerged and buried by an\r\nunconformable cover of waste derived from the non-submerged portion:\r\nhence when the whole area was lifted to something like its present\r\nheight, a new system of consequent streams was born on the revealed sea\r\nbottom. Since then, time enough may have passed to allow the streams to\r\nsink their channels through the unconformable cover and strip it off,\r\nand thus superimpose themselves on the Triassic rocks below: we should\r\ntherefore find them, in so far as they have not yet been re-adjusted,\r\nfollowing inconsequent, discordant courses on the under formation. The\r\nexisting overlap of the Cretaceous beds on the still buried Triassic\r\nportion of the old Schooley peneplain makes it evident that such an\r\norigin for the Watchung streams is possible; but it has not yet been\r\nindependently proved that the Cretaceous cover ever reached so far\r\ninland as to cross the Watchung ridges.\r\n\r\nWant of other explanation for the Watchung streams is not satisfactory\r\nevidence in favor of the explanation here suggested. There should be\r\nexternal evidence that the Triassic area has actually been submerged\r\nand buried after it was baselevelled to the Schooley peneplain and\r\nbefore it was uplifted to its present altitude; other streams as well\r\nas the ones thus far indicated, should bear signs of superimposition;\r\nand if adjustment of the superimposed courses has begun, it should be\r\nsystematically carried farthest near the largest streams. I shall not\r\nhere state more than in brief form, the sufficient evidence that can be\r\nquoted in favor of the first and second requisites. Suffice it to say\r\nthat the overlap of the Cretaceous beds (which contain practically no\r\nTriassic fragments) on the bevelled Triassic strata at Amboy and\r\nelsewhere indicates submergence after baselevelling; and that the\r\npebbles, sands and marls of the Cretaceous series point clearly to the\r\nHighlands as their source. The submergence must therefore have reached\r\ninland across the Triassic formation at least to the margin of the\r\ncrystalline rocks. Some shore-line cutting must have been done at the\r\nmargin of the Highlands during Cretaceous time, but the generally\r\nrolling surface of the old peneplain leads me to ascribe its origin\r\nchiefly to subaërial wasting. Moreover, the North Branch of the\r\nRaritan, between Mendham and Peapack (* Fig. 1) and the Lockatong (L),\r\na small branch of the Delaware on the West Hunterdon sandstone plateau,\r\ngive striking indications of superimposition in the discordance of\r\ntheir courses with the weaker structural lines of their basins, so\r\nunlike the thoroughly adjusted course of the Musconetcong and its\r\nfellows, the Pohatcong, the Lopatcong, and others.\r\n\r\nThe third requisite of the proof of the inland extension of the\r\nCretaceous, and the resulting superimposed origin of the Watchung\r\nstreams may be stated in detail, as being more in the line of this\r\nessay: has the adjustment that accompanies superimposition\r\nsystematically advanced farther near the large streams than near the\r\nsmall ones? The character of this adjustment should be first examined\r\ndeductively. Given a series of streams of different volumes, flowing\r\nsoutheastward, in the direction of the present dip of the remnant of\r\nthe Cretaceous cover, over the former inland extension of this\r\nsuperposed formation; how will these streams react on one another when\r\nthey sink their channels into the underlying Triassic formation?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe conditions during the formation of the cover of Cretaceous beds are\r\nillustrated in fig. 2, where the Triassic portion of the peneplain is\r\nsubmerged, and the shore-line of the transgressing ocean has reached\r\nthe margin of the crystalline rocks. The waste from the crystallines is\r\nspread out as a series of gravels, sands and marls on the baselevelled\r\nTriassic area.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nThen follows the elevation and tilting of the peneplain with the cover\r\non its back; and with this regression of the sea, there is an\r\nequivalent gain of new land; a smooth gently sloping plain is revealed\r\nas the shore line retreats; streams run out across it from the\r\ncrystalline area, or begin on its open surface, growing mouthward as\r\nthe land rises. Three such streams, A, C, D, are shown in fig. 3; their\r\nopportunity for deep valley-cutting is indicated by the depth of the\r\nnew baselevel, BL, below the general surface of the country. While\r\nthese streams are deepening their channels in the Cretaceous cover,\r\nwhich is unshaded with marginal contour lines in the figures, their\r\nsubsequent, autogenetic branches are irregularly disposed, because\r\nthere is no lateral variation of structure to guide them; but after a\r\ntime, the baselevelled surface of the buried Triassic beds is reached,\r\nas is shown by linear shading in the valley bottoms of figs. 4, 5, 6,\r\n7. The growth of the subsequent branches then developed, will be along\r\nthe strike of the Triassic softer beds, that is, about square to the\r\ncourse of the three transverse streams under consideration. The most\r\nrapid growth will be found on the branches of the largest stream, A,\r\nbecause it will most quickly cut down its channel close to the\r\nbaselevel of the time and thus provide steep sloping valley-sides, from\r\nwhich the subsequent branches cut backwards most energetically. In due\r\ntime the main streams discover the particularly resistant transverse\r\nlava sheets in the underlying formation; and then the subsequent\r\nbranches of the largest transverse stream on the up-stream side of the\r\nobstructions, for example, F and G, fig. 4, will have a great advantage\r\nover those of the smaller streams. The most rapidly growing subsequent\r\nbranch, G, fig. 5, of the largest transverse master stream, A, may grow\r\nheadwards so fast as to push away the divide, X, which separates it\r\nfrom the head of the opposing subsequent branch, J, of the next\r\nadjacent smaller transverse stream, C, and thus finally to capture and\r\ndivert the headwaters, H, of the smaller transverse stream to the\r\nlarger one, as in fig. 6. The divide creeps while the two opposing\r\nsubsequent branches are in contest; it leaps when the successful\r\nsubsequent branch reaches the channel of the conquered stream. The\r\nfirst stream captured in this way must necessarily be the nearest to\r\nthe large stream. The diversion of the considerable volume of\r\nheadwaters, H, to the channel of the small subsequent branch, G, causes\r\nit to deepen its channel rapidly; the same effect is perceptible in H\r\nfor a distance above its point of capture and diversion: the increased\r\nload of sediment thus given to G will be in great part dropped in a\r\nfan-delta where it enters the flat valley of the master stream, A,\r\n(fig. 6).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nGaining strength by conquest, other captures are made, faster for a\r\ntime, but with decreasing slowness as the head of the diverting\r\nsubsequent branch recedes from the original master: and at last,\r\nequilibrium may be gained when the headwater slope of the diverting\r\nbranch is no greater than that of the opposing subsequent branch of the\r\nnext uncaptured transverse stream. After the capture of a transverse\r\nstream has been effected in this way, the divide, Y, between its\r\ndiverted upper portions, H, fig. 6, and its beheaded lower portion, C,\r\nwill be pushed down stream by the growth of an inverted stream, V. This\r\ngoes on until equilibrium is attained and further shifting is prevented\r\non reaching the hard transverse lava sheets, Z, fig. 7; here the divide\r\nis maturely established. In the case of a system of transverse streams,\r\nC, D, etc., fig. 7, successively captured by the subsequent branch of a\r\nsingle master, the divides (Z, Y'), between the inverted (V, V') and\r\nbeheaded (C, D) portions of the captured streams will for a time\r\npresent different stages of approach to establishment. The divide on\r\nthe line of that one of the original streams, C, that is nearest to the\r\nmaster stream, A, may reach a final stable position, Z; while on the\r\nnext stream further away from the master, the beheaded portion, D, may\r\nstill retain a short piece above the gap in the upper lava sheet, not\r\nyet secured by the inverted stream, V'; and a third stream, further\r\naway still from the master (not shown in figure 7) might remain\r\nuncaptured and independent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nIt is by such tests as these that we may hope to recognize the\r\noccurrence of partial adjustment in the streams of the Watchung\r\ncrescent as a result of their superimposition on the Triassic formation\r\nfrom its former Cretaceous cover. The greater the degree of complexity\r\nin the tests proposed, the more confidence we shall have in the theory\r\nwhen the tests successfully meet the facts. Hence the reason for\r\ndeductively carrying out the theoretical conditions to their extremest\r\nconsequences in order to increase the complexity of the tests that are\r\nto be confronted with the facts. This, as a matter of method, seems to\r\nme of great practical importance in any attempt to decipher the past\r\nprogress of geographical development.\r\n\r\nThe admirable contoured topographic maps of New Jersey, issued by the\r\nGeological Survey of that state under the leadership of the late\r\nProfessor George H. Cook, afforded means of applying the deductive\r\ntests above outlined without the necessity of plodding over all the\r\ncountry concerned; but however good the maps are, it is hardly\r\nnecessary to say that they can be interpreted with a better\r\nappreciation of the facts that they represent after an excursion on the\r\nground has given the student some personal acquaintance with it. This I\r\nhave tried to gain on various occasions, maps in hand.\r\n\r\nAtlas sheet number six, including the Central red-sandstone area, and\r\nthe five-mile-to-an-inch geological map of the state present in the\r\nclearest manner the facts of form and structure involved in our\r\nproblem; and to my mind, the correspondence between theory and fact is\r\nvery striking. The Pequannock-Passaic is the master transverse stream\r\nof the region: its preëminence was probably due in the beginning to its\r\ngathering, from the unsubmerged Highlands, a greater amount of drainage\r\nthan belonged to any other stream that ran southeastward down the\r\ngentle slope of the newly revealed Cretaceous cover. It was at that\r\ntime a compound, composite river:[5] compound because it drained areas\r\nof different ages; composite, because these areas were of different\r\nstructures. Existing examples of compound, composite rivers are seen in\r\nthe Catawba, the Yadkin-Pedee, the Cape Fear and the Neuse rivers of\r\nNorth Carolina, which all rise on the inland crystalline area, and\r\ntraverse the coastal quaternary plain before reaching the sea. But\r\nunlike these, there must have been, when the old submerged land rose\r\nwith the Cretaceous cover on its back, numerous small streams whose\r\ndrainage area lay entirely within the Cretaceous plain. These were\r\nsimple streams, flowing over a structure of one kind and one age. Their\r\nmodern homologues are seen in the Maurice, the Great and Little Egg\r\nHarbor and the Wading rivers of southern New Jersey, and I suppose also\r\nin various relatively short streams of North Carolina, such as the\r\nLumber, Great Cohera and Moccassin.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: See terminology suggested by the author. Nat. Geogr. Mag.,\r\ni, 1889, 218.]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be supposed that the original Pequannock-Passaic possessed\r\nthe large southern branch, which I shall call the upper Passaic, by\r\nwhich Great Swamp is now drained;[6] for had this been the case, the\r\ndivides between the branches of the upper Passaic and the heads of the\r\nsmall streams that now still cross both of the trap ridges, must have\r\nlong ago been driven to a stable position on the crest line of the\r\ninner ridge. The upper Passaic member of the Pequannock-Passaic system\r\nmust be regarded as a branch of subsequent development, guided by some\r\nof the softer Triassic beds when they were reached beneath the\r\nCretaceous cover, and very successful in capturing and diverting other\r\ntransverse streams that were smaller than its master. For some distance\r\non either side from the Pequannock-Passaic gap in the trap ridges at\r\nPatterson, the existing streams are perfectly adjusted to the Triassic\r\nstructure; that is, the ridges are persistent divides, and the lateral\r\nsubsequent branches of the master flow along the strike of the softer\r\nshales and sandstones, except where lately thrown off their courses by\r\nglacial drift barriers. This I interpret as meaning that the\r\nPequannock-Passaic master stream hereabouts made so early a capture of\r\nadjacent superimposed streams that all traces of their initial\r\ndiscordant courses have been obliterated by the development of\r\nstructurally accordant subsequent streams.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: It should be recognized that the present round-about\r\ndrainage of the Great Swamp is a post-glacial feature, determined by\r\nthe morainic barrier that crosses the basin from Summit (S) to\r\nMorristown (M): the pre-glacial drainage of the southern part of the\r\ninner crescent was undoubtedly of a simpler and more direct pattern.]\r\n\r\nThe Watchung ridges extend only about eight miles northward of the\r\nPaterson gaps, but reach thirty miles southwestward. It is therefore\r\nchiefly in the latter direction that we may expect to find examples of\r\nincomplete adjustment following superimposition and capture. At\r\nMilburn, there is a deep gap in First mountain, and opposite this at\r\nSummit (S, fig. 1) a partly drift-filled gap in Second mountain: this I\r\nam disposed to regard as the former outlet of the Rockaway-Rahway\r\nriver, which on account of its considerable size was not captured by\r\nthe Passaic until it had cut its passage across the trap sheets almost\r\nto a safe depth. The diverted upper portion--the Rockaway--now joins\r\nthe Passaic; its crooked course from the Highlands via Boonton (Bn)\r\nbeing a post-glacial irregularity; the beheaded lower portion--the\r\nRahway--heads on the ridge of Second mountain, retains the pair of\r\nsubsequent streams between the two ridges, and flows in diminished\r\nvolume to the sea: the divide between the two portions being in its\r\nmature stable position on Second mountain.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Milburn gap, there are three streams that maintain water\r\ngaps in First mountain, and five head branches of these three streams\r\nrise behind the crest of Second mountain. These must be interpreted as\r\nremnants of streams that once rose further inland, and whose upper\r\ncourses have been captured by the victorious upper Passaic; but it is\r\nnoteworthy that here, at the greatest distance from the gap of the\r\nmaster stream at Paterson, the divides between the diverted and\r\nbeheaded portions of these southern streams should lie in unstable\r\npositions, back of the crest line of Second mountain. This is exactly\r\nwhat the hypothesis of a superimposed origin for these streams would\r\nrequire; and if the complexity of accordance between deduction and fact\r\nhere presented be duly considered, I believe new confidence may be\r\ngained in the hypothesis of superimposition, already rendered likely\r\nfrom other evidence.\r\n\r\nThe rectangular courses of the streams that cross First and Second\r\nmountains southwest of Milburn do not militate against their initial\r\nobliquely superimposed courses; for, as Gilbert has shown, oblique\r\ncourses across tilted beds, alternately hard and soft, will gradually\r\nshift until they follow rectangular courses, along the strike of the\r\nsoft beds and square across the strike of the hard beds. Middle Brook,\r\nat the southern bend of First mountain near Bound Brook (B, B),\r\npresents the peculiarity of branching east and west while on the trap\r\nsheet of the mountain: this may be due to a retention here, where the\r\ndip is moderate, of an initially superimposed bifurcation; or to\r\nguidance by fractures at this point where the course of the mountain\r\nchanges rather abruptly; the facts at hand do not serve to make choice\r\nbetween these alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe lesson of greatest importance in this study lies, to my mind, in\r\nthe gradual development of accordant subsequent streams in a region\r\nwhere the unchanged superimposed drainage would show no such\r\naccordance. Similar adjustment of subsequent streams to structural\r\nfeatures may characterize drainage systems that were originally\r\nantecedent: and with this principle in mind, I have recently read over\r\nwith renewed interest Powell's classic study of the Green river where\r\nit crosses the Uinta mountains.[7] The Green river and the smaller\r\nstreams of its lateral cañons and valleys are all regarded as\r\nantecedent. Let us examine the arguments on which this conclusion\r\nrests.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Exploration of the Colorado river of the west, Washington,\r\n1875, 152-166. See also the geological map in the Geology of the Uinta\r\nmountains, 1876.]\r\n\r\nThe Green river itself rises many miles north of the Uinta range,\r\ntraverses a relatively low basin before reaching the flank of the\r\nmountains, and then instead of turning away, it boldly enters the great\r\nuplift and trenches it from side to side in a profound cañon, flowing\r\nout to the southwest on its way to the Colorado. There is relatively\r\nlow ground at the eastern end of the range, several thousand feet lower\r\nthan the summits of the range on either side of the Green river cañon,\r\nand many thousand feet lower than the restored crest of the great\r\nuplift; but the river does not follow this open round-about course.\r\nPowell says that the river cut through, instead of running around, the\r\ngreat obstruction, because it \"had the right of way; ... it was running\r\nere the mountains were formed.\" Had the mountain fold been formed\r\nsuddenly, it would have turned the river around it to the east; \"but\r\nthe emergence of the fold above the general surface of the country was\r\nlittle or no faster than the progress of the corrasion of the\r\nchannel.\" ... \"The river preserved its level, but the mountains were\r\nlifted up.... The river was the saw which cut the mountains in two\"\r\n(152, 153). If this interpretation is correct, the Green river would be\r\nthe type of a perfect antecedent stream: but it appears to me that the\r\ncase is probably overstated in that respect. Perhaps it would have been\r\nmore deliberately stated in a later volume if Powell's intention of\r\ndescribing more fully the three chief kinds of drainage of the region\r\nhad been carried out.[8] Not having seen the region, my comments may\r\nhave little value; but the context of Powell's report, the description\r\nof the immense series of lacustrine beds, over a mile thick, north of\r\nthe mountains, and the eastward deflection of the river where it\r\ntraverses the mountains all seem to me to indicate that the Green was\r\nby no means continuously successful in maintaining its antecedent\r\ncourse across the uplift. It is by no means a typical antecedent river.\r\nThe great series of lacustrine beds up-stream from the cañon, with\r\nconglomerates where they rest on the northern flank of the mountains,\r\nare fully recognized in the report, and must mean that the upper\r\nportion of the river was for a time shut back, or ponded. During part\r\nof this time, there may have been no overflow across the growing\r\nmountains, for the lower lacustrine beds contain fossils indicative of\r\nbrackish water.[9] The intermittent growth of the mountains and the\r\nrepeated return of lacustrine conditions, with gradually freshening\r\nwater, is indicated by the strong unconformities that occur at various\r\npoints in the lacustrine beds, and by the change in the fossil fauna.\r\nIt must be conceded from this that the upper portion of Green river was\r\nrepeatedly ponded back by mountain growth across its middle course; we\r\ntherefore have not now any close indication of its pre-lacustrine\r\ncourse above the mountains; the ancient, or pre-Uinta, upper portion of\r\nthe river was extinguished by the lacustrine sediments, and to that\r\nextent the Green river departs from the perfect antecedent type.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Geol. Uinta mountain, page v.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Geology of the Uinta mountains, 1876, 84; Chapter III, by\r\nC. A. White.]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, if the original Green river existed upon the upper\r\nsurface of the beds that were at a subsequent date raised to form the\r\nUinta uplift, it does not appear to be clearly proved that its course\r\nat that early time was closely coincident with its present course in\r\nthe mountainous area. The first deformations of the mountain growth may\r\nhave temporarily interrupted its flow, as is made likely by the\r\nlacustrine deposits already referred to; and when the rise in the level\r\nof the waters of the lake overtook the uplift, probably at a time of\r\nslower mountain growth than that which first formed the lake, the point\r\nof overflow may have been many miles to one side of its previous\r\ndrowned-out course. The moderate elevation of the eastern end of the\r\nrange, where it connects with the Yampa plateau, may possibly have then\r\nbeen a little higher than a point farther west, where the overflow was\r\nconsequently located. This is perhaps hardly as probable as the\r\npostulates involved in arguing a truly antecedent course for the river;\r\nbut its impossibility is not as strictly proved as would be necessary\r\nbefore a definite conclusion as to the continuous persistence of an\r\nantecedent river could be finally accepted. Such continuity of action\r\nmust be rare and should be rigorously demonstrated if possible.\r\n\r\nIt must, moreover, be remembered that Emmons[10] is of the opinion that\r\nthe Colorado river is not antecedent at all, but is superimposed on the\r\neastern portion of the Uinta range from a course that it had chosen\r\nupon a sheet of horizontal sediments--the Wyoming conglomerate--which\r\nhe supposes once stretched unconformably all over the previously deeply\r\neroded surface of the uplifted range, where the cañon is now cut. He\r\nquotes facts of two kinds in evidence of this; first, the remnants of\r\nthe Wyoming conglomerate still lie on ridges as high as those that\r\nenclose the river cañons; second, the Green and certain of its branches\r\npossess tortuous courses, out of accord with the structure of the\r\nrange. It might be added that the wide open valley of Brown's park, in\r\nthe middle of the range is best explained as the product of a\r\npre-Wyoming cycle of erosion by rivers that were extinguished when the\r\nWyoming beds were laid over the mountains. The strongest objection to\r\nEmmons' conclusion seems to be the great amount of erosion that it\r\nrequires; erosion sufficient not only to remove the Wyoming\r\nconglomerate from nearly all its former overlap on the Uinta range,\r\nwhere it had buried and extinguished a pre-Wyoming drainage, but also\r\nto carry away a vast extension of the formation at the same height\r\nnorth of the range. It may be best to conclude that both antecedent and\r\nsuperimposed processes must be called on: for one must hesitate before\r\nadmitting that the Wyoming beds stretched all across the country north\r\nand east of the Uinta range up to the height at which the remnants are\r\nnow found on the range; it seems more likely that some part of the\r\nheight of these remnants is due to a relatively local elevation. As far\r\nas this is the case, it gives reason for regarding the Green as an\r\nantecedent river; that is, antecedent to the local elevation of the\r\nWyoming beds, but long posterior to the elevation of the Uinta range:\r\nbut as the river now flows--according to Emmons' theory--on beds lying\r\nunconformably below those on which its course was chosen, it is for\r\nthis reason to be classed as superimposed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Fortieth Parallel Survey, ii, 1877, 194, 205, 206.]\r\n\r\nThe Green river therefore certainly departs from the type of an\r\nantecedent stream; the departure is distinct in its repeated ponding,\r\nwhereby its upper course was broadly and indeterminately shifted from\r\nits original location; and is at least possible if not probable in its\r\ndefeat at the line of uplift and subsequent superimposition on a new\r\nline of overflow. The mountains wrenched the saw that afterwards cut\r\nthem in two.\r\n\r\nA study of the Jura drainage, of which a fuller account may be given at\r\nsome future time, has led to the provisional conclusion that many of\r\nits streams show a combination of consequent and antecedent\r\ncharacteristics. They appear to be consequent on the early stages of\r\nthe deformation but antecedent to its later growth, and for this kind\r\nof a stream I have no satisfactory name to suggest at present.\r\n\r\nHeim has shown that the Reuss and the adjacent smaller transverse\r\nstreams of northern Switzerland near Lucerne are in part persistent\r\nacross a series of folds, and in part slightly shifted from one course\r\nto another and ponded in Lake Lucerne; but unless the other ranges of\r\nthe Alps rise hereafter faster than they have heretofore, the geologist\r\nof the future will reasonably regard the more mature Reuss as an\r\nessentially successful antecedent river.\r\n\r\nThe Sutlej and other rivers that escape from the inner valleys of the\r\nHimalaya by deep gaps in the outer ranges, are described by Medlicott\r\nas antecedent to the elevation of the ranges through which they flow:\r\ntheir antecedent origin being argued from the delta-like structure of\r\nthe upturned beds in the outer gorges, as if the rivers were now\r\ncutting down the deformed deltas of an earlier time; but the heavy\r\ngravel and sand deposits in their upper valleys indicates that they\r\nwere nearly if not quite ponded for a time during the deformation.\r\n\r\nRivers seem to have the habit of cutting down their upturned deltas.\r\nBonney refers to several such examples among the rivers that flow\r\nnorthward from the Alps, and transect particularly thick portions of\r\nthe upturned marginal conglomerates and sandstones, which he regards as\r\nthe deltas formed by the same rivers at an earlier time, when the\r\nmountain folding had not extended outward as far as it does now from\r\nthe axis of the Alps. I have suspected that the same kind of evidence\r\nmight be used to indicate that the Delaware above Trenton, between\r\nPennsylvania and New Jersey, is in part of even pre-Triassic origin;\r\nfor where it now enters the Triassic belt, there is a particularly\r\nheavy and coarse sandstone, sometimes conglomeratic. Being a large\r\nstream, it might persist in an anaclinal course through the\r\nnorthwestward monocline formed by the Jurassic uplift of the Triassic\r\nbeds, although the smaller streams of the region were then probably\r\nextinguished, to be replaced by a new system consequent upon the new\r\norder of things.\r\n\r\nLarge rivers, more or less persistent in the face of opposing\r\ndisturbance, therefore appear to be generally recognized; but it is\r\nnoticeable that those quoted from the Himalaya and the Alps presumably\r\noccupied, at the time of disturbance, well enclosed valleys, from which\r\nit would have been difficult for them to escape backwards or laterally;\r\nand that, even if successful in the end, they for a time suffered\r\ndefeat or ponding of greater or less extent and duration. There is no\r\nevidence that the Green river was well enclosed immediately north of\r\nthe Uinta mountains at the time of their first elevation; hence the\r\nlikelihood of its temporary ponding or enclosure is increased.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by Powell that not only the Green but even the smaller\r\nstreams of the Uintas are of origin antecedent to the mountains. He\r\nwrites: \"the explanation of the cañons of Green river will assist us in\r\nunderstanding the origin of the lateral valleys and cañons. The streams\r\nwere there before the mountains were made--that is, the streams carved\r\nout the valleys and left the mountains. The direction of the streams is\r\nindisputable evidence that the elevation of the fold was so slow as not\r\nto divert the streams, although the total amount of elevation was many\r\nthousands of feet. Had the fold been lifted more rapidly than the\r\nprincipal streams could have cut their channels, Green river would have\r\nbeen turned about it, and all the smaller streams and waterways would\r\nhave been cataclinal\" (Colorado River, 162).\r\n\r\nThis appears to me an unproved conclusion, and the evidence of it needs\r\ncareful attention. It appears that there are several streams which\r\ndescend from the crest of the mountains towards the flanks, but instead\r\nof running all the way out to the margin of the fold, they turn along\r\nthe strike of a monoclinal valley, and thus reach the main river by a\r\nshort cut. Such streams are cataclinal for a time, then monoclinal. It\r\nis in reference to these that it is said, \"the streams were there\r\nbefore the mountains were made;\" and again that \"the drainage was\r\nestablished antecedent to the corrugation or displacement of the beds\r\nby faulting and folding\" (163). In approaching this conclusion, Powell\r\nsays these streams cannot be consequent; for \"valleys consequent upon\r\nthe corrugation, which was one of the conditions of the origin of the\r\nUinta mountains, could not have taken the direction observed in this\r\nsystem; they would have all been cataclinal, as they ran down from the\r\nmountains, and turned into synclinal valleys at the foot, forming a\r\nvery different system from that which now obtains\" (166). Nor can the\r\nstreams be superimposed, for the \"later sedimentary beds, both to the\r\nnorth and south, were found not to have been continuous over the\r\nmountain system, but to have been deposited in waters whose shores were\r\nlimited by the lower reaches of the range\" (166). Therefore the\r\ndiscordant streams must be antecedent.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that the possibility of error in this argument lies in\r\nthe omission of all consideration of the migration of divides and the\r\nresulting adjustment of stream courses to deep internal structure; but\r\nat the time of the exploration of the Colorado river, this important\r\nprocess in the development of rivers was not understood. It now seems\r\nonly natural that the original, consequent, cataclinal streams, flowing\r\ndown the slopes of the range from crest to flanks, should have\r\npermitted the opening of subsequent monoclinal branches on the soft\r\nbeds that they discovered; and that the shifting of divides in these\r\nmonoclinal valleys should have led to the capture of several cataclinal\r\nstreams by that particular one of the subsequent branches that grew out\r\nfrom the master stream, the Green river itself. Thus it must happen\r\nthat the streams \"which head near the summit of the range, and, running\r\ndown the flank, turn into the Green river, are, in their upper courses,\r\ncataclinal, and when they turn to follow the strike of the rocks into\r\nGreen river, are monoclinal\" (161): this being a normal result of river\r\nwork in cutting down the thousands of feet of rocks of various\r\nhardnesses, here concerned. The smaller streams of the Uinta range are\r\ntherefore certainly not of necessity antecedent to the Uinta uplift:\r\nthe probability is that they were originally purely consequent, and\r\nthat at present they are nicely adjusted to the structures that they\r\nhave discovered.\r\n\r\nI have learned so much from the doctrine of baselevelling, as presented\r\nin Major Powell's writings, that I shall hope to profit by the lesson\r\nof the Uinta drainage as well: that is, the possibility that an\r\napparently sound conclusion may be overturned when new processes that\r\nbear upon it are discovered. It is here said that the drainage of the\r\nWatchung crescent in New Jersey is an example of partial adjustment\r\nfollowing a superimposed origin: hence the necessity of watching\r\nclosely for the discovery of new principles in the history of river\r\nwork that may call for a revision of this conclusion.\r\n\r\nThere are two other examples of peculiar accidents in the history of\r\nrivers in New Jersey, to which I wish to call attention; both of them\r\nin the latest cycle of the development of the State, that is, in the\r\ncycle which has changed the central region from its even baselevelled\r\nlowland surface, to the pastplain as we now see it. Like the uplift of\r\nthe Schooley (Highland) peneplain, the uplift of the Central plain, in\r\npassing from the second to the third cycle, was not uniform throughout,\r\nbut was greater in one place than in another. In the neighborhood of\r\nthe lower Raritan river, a distinct though gentle slope to the\r\nnorthwest is apparent in the unconsumed surface of the pastplain; but\r\nthis strong river runs southeastward against the slope; it is an\r\nanaclinal stream. The tilting of the pastplain is moderate, and its\r\nrocks are weak; the river is large and strong. Its anaclinal course is\r\ntherefore best explained by regarding it as a mild example of an\r\nantecedent stream. But Ambrose's brook, a small stream to one side of\r\nthe Raritan, flows northwest with the gentle slope that was given to\r\nthe pastplain. Ambrose's brook therefore most likely is not a survivor\r\nfrom the previous cycle, but is a new stream consequent on the slight\r\ndeformation by which the latest cycle here considered was ushered in.\r\nManalapan and Assanpink are apparently of the same kind. (See fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe Millstone river appears to be intermediate as respects origin\r\nbetween the Raritan and Ambrose's brook. It appears still to lie for\r\nthe most part in the channel that it occupied before the elevation and\r\ntilting of the baselevelled Central plain, but the tilting of the plain\r\nseems to have reversed its direction of flow. It rises near the center\r\nof the State and flows northwestward till it joins the Raritan near\r\nSomerville, and on the way it crosses from the thrown or depressed to\r\nthe heaved or elevated side of the \"fall-line,\"[11] and passes through\r\na deep gap in the trap ridge of Rocky Hill back of Princeton. I believe\r\nthere is no other Atlantic river which runs against the fall-line in\r\nthis way; and it is certainly at first sight remarkable that a stream\r\nof moderate size like the Millstone should have held its own against a\r\ndisplacement that sufficed to deflect great rivers like the Delaware\r\nand the Susquehanna from their courses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: For an account of the \"fall-line\" displacement, see\r\nMcGee, Seventh Ann. Rep., U. S. G. S., 1888, 616.]\r\n\r\nThe Millstone appears to have been a stream of the normal kind in the\r\nprevious cycle, before the tilting of the Central plain, when it\r\nprobably ran southeastward with its fellows, and carried off its share\r\nof waste in the baselevelling process of that time. No other\r\nsupposition than this seems consistent with the general history of the\r\nregion. It was during that cycle that the deep gap was cut in the Rocky\r\nHill trap ridge. Then came the deformation of the baselevelled plain,\r\nthe relatively recent elevation and gentle tilting that have permitted\r\nthe streams to carve it into a pastplain; and with this, the\r\ndislocation along the fall-line. The inclination of the interstream\r\nsurfaces of the pastplain leaves no doubt that it was tilted to the\r\nnorthwest, and to this tilting we must ascribe the present direction of\r\nthe Millstone flow: but why did not the accompanying dislocation on the\r\nfall-line throw this moderate sized stream off of its track and divert\r\nit southwestward to the Delaware at Trenton, or northeastward to the\r\nRaritan below New Brunswick. The effect of the dislocation appears with\r\nconsiderable distinctness along a line from Trenton towards Amboy, in\r\nthe less altitude of the general surface of the pastplain to the\r\nsoutheast than to the northwest of the line, the difference of altitude\r\nof the two parts being about a hundred feet. The persistence of the\r\nMillstone against such a dislocation seems to require that we should\r\npostulate a slower and smaller movement here than that which deflected\r\nthe Delaware.\r\n\r\nThe reversed course of the Millstone cannot be regarded as an example\r\nof inversion following a capture of its ancient northern headwaters by\r\na branch of the Raritan; for in such a case, surely the inversion could\r\nnot have progressed farther south than the hard trap ridge of Rocky\r\nHill, where a stable divide would have been formed: nor can the\r\nMillstone be regarded as an original stream, first developed and\r\nconsequent upon the deformation of the Central plain, for in that case,\r\nit should consist of two separate parts; one part running from the\r\nactual head of the river to the fall-line, where it would turn\r\nsouthwest and cross the faint flat divide that separates it from the\r\nDelaware; the other part beginning by Princeton north of the fall-line,\r\nand running thence north to the Raritan. The continuity of these two\r\nparts in the actual Millstone seems to be explicable only by regarding\r\nthe river as the upper portion of a single larger river that had\r\nreached an old age in the previous cycle; it was then broken in two at\r\nthe head of the present river where the greatest elevation of the\r\nCentral plain occurred, and thus had its former head waters reversed\r\nfrom a southeast to a northwest direction of flow across and against\r\nthe fall-line break by the tilting of the plain. Only in this way can\r\nthe deep gap in Rocky Hill be explained. The river is thus consequent\r\non the tilting of the plain, and yet antecedent to the accompanying\r\nfaulting. It cannot be called an original stream, for it had an\r\nancestor in its very channel. It is not a purely consequent stream, for\r\nit runs against the heaved side of a fault. It is not a strictly\r\nantecedent stream, for it flows in a direction determined by a\r\ndisturbance that occurred late in its life. It is too exceptional a\r\nstream to have a generic name. We cannot expect to find many others\r\nlike it.\r\n\r\nThe result that has been of the greatest interest to me in these\r\nstudies is the discovery of well-recorded and peculiar histories in the\r\ncommonplace small-sized rivers of our Atlantic slope. We have looked\r\nfor some years to the west as the region where river history should be\r\nillustrated, because it was there that the pioneers in this branch of\r\nstudy taught us the lessons on which our further work must depend. But\r\nhome study as well as distant travel has its rewards, and with the\r\nprogress of good topographic work on this side of the country we\r\nconfidently await much instruction from a close acquaintance with the\r\ncurious histories of many of our rivers which we know now only by name.\r\n\r\n  Harvard College, January, 1890.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Supplementary Note_.--Professor Albrecht Penck of Vienna has published\r\na valuable essay on \"Die Bildung der Durchbruchsthäler\" (Verein zur\r\nVerbreitung naturwissenschaftlicher Kenntnisse in Wien, 1888) from\r\nwhich the following historical notes are taken to illustrate the\r\ngradual overthrow of the fracture theory of cross valleys by the\r\nintroduction of the idea that rivers can sometimes cut down their beds\r\nas fast as the land is uplifted or upfolded beneath them.\r\n\r\nFerd.

With a Map.\r\n\r\nBY WM. H. DALL.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.--Introductory remarks.--Instruments and Methods.--Sources of\r\ninformation.--Translation of Bering's Report.--Bering's List of\r\nGeographical Positions.--An Itinerary of the Expedition.--Annotated\r\nSynopsis of the Voyage compiled from all accessible data.--Comparative\r\nTable of Geographical Positions.--Resumé of the results of the\r\nExpedition.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1648 the tide of exploration and adventure setting eastward through\r\nSiberia, impelled the fitting out of seven small trading boats on the\r\nKolyma river. Three of these, in charge of Simeon Deshneff, Gerasim\r\nAnkudinoff and Feodor Alexieff, respectively, reached Bering Strait.\r\nAnkudinoff's boat was wrecked on East Cape, but his party was\r\naccommodated on the others. There were hostilities with the Chukchi,\r\nthe two boats were separated, and Deshneff's alone finally reached\r\nKamchatka. Next year he constructed the trading post on the Anadyr\r\nriver subsequently known as Anadyrsk.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition that in 1654 a trader named Taras Stadukin\r\nfollowed Deshneff's route, made a portage across the neck of East Cape,\r\ncircumnavigated Kamchatka, discovered the Kurile Islands, and finally\r\nreached the Gulf of Penjina in safety.\r\n\r\nIn 1711 an emissary named Peter Iliunsen Popoff was sent to East Cape\r\nby the Russians to induce the Chukchi to pay tribute. In this he\r\nfailed, but brought back an account of islands beyond East Cape, and of\r\na continent reported by the Chukchi to exist beyond these islands. Some\r\nstatements which he made in regard to the people of this continent were\r\nregarded by geographers of the last century as fictitious, but with our\r\nbetter knowledge, they set the seal of authenticity upon Popoff's\r\nreport and show that his journey was really made.\r\n\r\nThe political disorders which prevailed in Western Russia about this\r\nperiod, prevented any attention from being directed to the reports of\r\nthese explorations, which were preserved in the archives at Yakutsk.\r\nSomewhat later the attention of geographers was directed toward this\r\nunknown corner of the world and the subject was brought to the notice\r\nof Peter the Great. He took great interest in it, drew up instructions\r\nfor an expedition with his own hand and delivered them to Count Apraxin\r\nwith orders to see them executed. A few days later, in January, 1725,\r\nhe died; but the Empress desiring to carry out all the plans of her\r\ndeceased husband as closely as possible, ordered their execution.\r\nFleet-Captain Vitus Ivanovich Bering was nominated to the command of\r\nthe expedition and Lieutenants Martin Spanberg[1] and Alexie Chirikoff\r\nto be his assistants.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: So spelled by Bering himself.]\r\n\r\nThis expedition forms the subject of this paper. It has been treated of\r\nby various geographers and biographers, but so far the original report\r\nof Bering, printed in 1847 in the Russian language, has never been\r\nfaithfully translated into any other language; while his map has never,\r\nin its entirety, been published at all. Reduced sketches derived from\r\nthe maps and more or less mutilated and garbled versions of the report\r\nhave appeared in sundry collections of voyages, and upon these the\r\nlatest contributions to the history of the expedition have been in\r\ngreat part based.\r\n\r\nBelieving that the original report is a document of sufficient historic\r\nand geographic interest to be made accessible to those who do not read\r\nRussian, and that the errors of existing works make a critical review\r\nof the subject desirable, I have translated the document in question\r\nand prepared a general review of the present state of our knowledge in\r\nregard to the expedition.\r\n\r\nBering's Report being written in archaic and badly spelled Russian,\r\nwith a singular disregard of punctuation and other literary niceties,\r\nthe translation presented unusual difficulties, in solving which I have\r\nhad the kind coöperation of that excellent Russian scholar Mr. J.\r\nCurtin. I am indebted to the Reverend Father Richards, president of\r\nGeorgetown University, and Father Maas of Woodstock College, Md., for\r\nvaluable information in regard to the church festivals and saints,\r\nwhose names were utilized in the nomenclature of Bering's new\r\ndiscoveries. To Mr. Marcus Baker, Messrs. Gannett and Woodward, and Mr.\r\nC. C. Darwin of the Geological Survey; Dr. S. Hertzenstein of the\r\nZoological Museum of the Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg; Baron\r\nNordenskiöld of Stockholm, and Baron Robert Klinckofström; Drs. Holm\r\nand Stejneger of the U. S. National Museum, and Prof. Julius Olson of\r\nMadison, Wisconsin, I am indebted for numerous favors and courteous\r\nassistance, and to all of these gentlemen I desire to express my\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I desire to state that I am well aware this paper cannot\r\nbe regarded as a finality, but as a contribution to the geographical\r\nhistory of North America it will not be without its value, while the\r\nfact that I have myself spent parts of three summers in scientific\r\nexploration of the coast visited by Bering and first charted by him,\r\nhas greatly helped me in my discussion of minor details of his work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BERING'S CHART OF HIS FIRST VOYAGE. FROM D'ANVILLES\r\nATLAS. 1737. The first published map of his Explorations.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTS AND METHODS.\r\n\r\nIn considering the work done by the expedition it is very necessary to\r\nbear in mind the character of the instrumental outfit, if any, which\r\nthey might have possessed, and the state of the science of navigation\r\nat the time.\r\n\r\nWhen Bering and his two cartographers left St. Petersburg in February,\r\n1725, the astronomical instrument in use by navigators was the Davis\r\nquadrant or \"backstaff,\" in which the sun's altitude was measured by\r\nsighting without a telescope or tube on the shadow cast by the sun from\r\none projection of the instrument upon another, the observer's back of\r\ncourse, being turned to the luminary. The only alternative to this was\r\nthe still older astrolabe with which the observer had to look along the\r\ntwo lines of his angle at the same time, and which also depended upon\r\nsights or spurs attached to a frame. The reflecting quadrant of Hadley\r\nwas not invented until 1731 and telescopes were not used on the\r\ninstruments of navigation until somewhat later. There were no\r\nchronometers or reliable watches or clocks for use in dividing\r\nintervals of time. Even after the Hadley quadrant came into use, time\r\nwas noted by a pendulum vibrating seconds, which could not be used on\r\nship-board.\r\n\r\nA futile attempt had been made by means of tables of variation of the\r\ncompass to determine the longitude by comparison with observed\r\nvariation in the field. Results by this method approached the truth\r\naccidentally, if at all. Lunar observations were the only means of\r\ngetting an approximation to the longitude except the occultations of\r\nJupiter's satellites, both methods being impracticable on board ship,\r\nwith the instruments then employed.\r\n\r\nIn 1731 the astronomer Halley proved[2] that at that date it was still\r\nimpossible to find the longitude correctly by the moon, the lunar\r\ntables being so inaccurate that an error of several hundred miles was\r\nquite possible and an accurate determination would depend upon the\r\nrespective errors of instrument, observation and the lunar tables\r\nhappening to balance one another. Halley ventured to express the hope\r\nthat the tables may be so amended that an error may scarce ever exceed\r\nthree minutes, which would correspond to a degree and a half of\r\nlongitude, amounting at the equator to a distance of a little less than\r\none hundred miles. Messerschmidt, who preceded Bering as an explorer of\r\nEastern Siberia, was according to Middendorf (Sib. Reise, iv. 1, p. 56)\r\nthirty-two degrees out in his determination of the longitude, and the\r\neastward extent of Asia in this region was underrated by that amount or\r\nthereabouts, on many maps.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Phil. Trans. 1731, No. 421.]\r\n\r\nOne other means of approximating to the meridian remained, in the\r\nobservation of eclipses. This from the comparative rarity of these\r\noccurrences in the case of the sun and moon, could with the imperfect\r\ninstruments of those days be available but seldom. Owing to the\r\ndifficulty of determining the exact time of the first and last contacts\r\nthe longitudes computed by these observations were liable to quite as\r\ngreat inaccuracy as those computed from the lunar tables. Still an\r\nordinary spyglass would enable an observer to note the time within a\r\nminute or two, and, if he was possessed of the local time, a simple\r\ncomparison with the observed time of the eclipse in some locality where\r\nthe longitude was known would give a fairly good determination,\r\nconsidering the instruments and methods of those days. Of the four\r\neclipses of the moon occurring in 1728-9 two might have been observed\r\nwithout difficulty by Bering, one would have been invisible to him, and\r\none might barely have been noted, but in all probability was not\r\nobserved by him. In none of the published reports of the expedition is\r\nany mention made by Bering or his officers of the occurrence or\r\nobservation of an eclipse, which seems very singular if by such an\r\nobservation he was enabled to correct an error of 30° in the longitude\r\nof northeastern Siberia. However, Middendorf states (Sib. Reise, iv. 1,\r\np. 56) that \"Bering and his lieutenant in the years 1728 and 1729\r\nobserved in Kamchatka[3] two eclipses of the moon,\" by which they\r\ncorrected the longitude. He gives no authority for this statement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: It is possible that an eclipse observed at Ilimsk in\r\nMiddle Siberia by Chirikoff is thus erroneously referred to.]\r\n\r\nEuler, who had access to the archives of the Admiralty College, while\r\nengaged on a Geography of Russia, mentions (Philos. Trans., No. 482, p.\r\n421) that he was informed that Bering observed an eclipse \"at\r\nKamchatka.\" This letter of Euler's is copied by Campbell in Harris'\r\nVoyages (vol. II, Book III, p. 1024) and the expression \"at Kamchatka\"\r\nhas led to the statement that these observations were made at the fort\r\nor village of Lower Kamchatka. This is an error since Bering gives no\r\nlongitude for the fort in his table of geographical positions. It must\r\nbe remembered that the name Kamchatka at that period was applied not\r\nmerely to the peninsula as at present, but also to the whole region of\r\nnortheastern Siberia, the governor of Kamchatka being located at\r\nOkhotsk. So to come within the probable meaning of the phrases used by\r\nMiddendorf and Euler it is only necessary to suppose that the\r\nobservations were made somewhere in that region. Lauridsen (Danish\r\nedition, note 34, p. 186) refers to a paper of Struve (Bull.\r\nphys.-math. Acad. St. Petersb., I, 1842, p. 290) containing a table of\r\ngeographical positions in Russia, in connection with these alleged\r\nobservations of Bering. An examination of Struve's paper does not bear\r\nout the implication of Lauridsen's reference, as Struve not only makes\r\nno mention whatever of Bering's observations there but specifically\r\nstates that the first observations of precision made in this part of\r\nSiberia were those of Krassilnikoff who accompanied Bering's second\r\nexpedition in 1741. It would seem extraordinary that a determination so\r\nimportant for geography as that of Bering and his companion should be\r\nunknown to so distinguished an astronomer as Struve who must have had\r\naccess to all the archives of the early explorations by Russia. But it\r\nmay be perhaps accounted for by the facts that Bering's observations\r\nwere necessarily of a very rough and primitive character--as it is\r\ncertain he had no instruments of precision; and that, for that reason,\r\nthey were not received with entire confidence; so that Struve may have\r\nconsidered them insufficiently exact to be included with those of\r\nKrassilnikoff and others made with more modern appliances.\r\n\r\nFrom the note in regard to the eclipses which is kindly contributed by\r\nMr. Marcus Baker and from the other circumstances, it is evident that\r\nif Bering and his party made the observations alluded to, the eclipses\r\nnoted were the partial eclipse of Feb. 25 (local calendar), 1728, of\r\nwhich he might have observed the last contact, or the total eclipse of\r\nFeb. 14, 1729, of which he might have observed the first contact and\r\nthe totality. At the time of the last eclipse he was at Lower Kamchatka\r\npost, and as, in the list of positions handed in with his Report in\r\n1730, no longitude is entered for this locality, it would seem that\r\nchoice is reduced to the first of the two mentioned; which occurred\r\nwhen Bering was either at Bolsheretsk or on his way from that place to\r\nLower Kamchatka, which he reached about a month later. Campbell's table\r\nof positions is credited by him to the year 1728, but my own opinion is\r\nthat it was really derived (with various errors, interpolations, etc.)\r\nfrom Bering's table of 1730.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary method of getting the longitude of a place, and that upon\r\nwhich Bering originally depended, as his itinerary table shows, was by\r\na continuous record of the distances and directions traveled from a\r\npoint of known longitude. This record would afford the data from which\r\nthe distance on a mean parallel, by means of a traverse table, could be\r\ncomputed. Laborious, imperfect, and slow as it was, it was the only\r\nsure reliance of the traveler in those days. Whether Bering observed an\r\neclipse or not, it is certain that his original dependence was upon his\r\nitinerary, that his report was based upon that and that this part of\r\nhis work was done as well as the nature of the method would permit. His\r\nsilence about the eclipse may be due to the fact that he depended not\r\nupon astronomical but upon pedometric observations, to which the\r\neclipse may have afforded some corrections. At any rate the pedometric\r\ndetermination of the distance between Tobolsk and Okhotsk or the\r\npeninsula of Kamchatka was in itself a tremendous undertaking.\r\n\r\nI find by a rough calculation from Bering's data that the longitude\r\nresulting from his itinerary from Tobolsk to Okhotsk is 77° 36' E. The\r\ndistance in a straight line is about 2,390 miles, but by the route\r\nBering traveled the distance is a little more than 3,746 miles. The\r\nlongitude in Bering's List of Positions is 76° 07', which differs from\r\nthe pedometric measurement by 1° 29' (or about 45 miles). On Bering's\r\nmap, Okhotsk is located in longitude 74° 30' E. of Tobolsk, while the\r\nmost modern observations for Okhotsk put it in 142° 40' E. of Greenwich\r\nor 75° 40' E. of Tobolsk. So that Bering's pedometric measurement was\r\nnearly 60 miles in excess; his revised table (as corrected by the\r\neclipse?) 27 miles in excess; and his map about 30 miles in error in\r\nthe opposite direction. These discrepancies show the inexactness of the\r\nmethods then in vogue and also that the pedometric method was not very\r\nmuch worse than the others in its results. Although there are several\r\ntypographic or other errors in his table of itinerary which render\r\nexact comparisons impossible, it may be said that the error of the\r\npedometric method, including the passage by sea from Okhotsk to\r\nKamchatka, averages about two degrees or sixty geographical miles. In\r\nthe cases of Okhotsk and Bolsheretsk the error is one of excess; in the\r\ncase of the cape at the mouth of the Kamchatka river and of the turning\r\npoint of the expedition north of Bering Strait, the result is too small\r\nby about the same amount.\r\n\r\nThat his chart and his revised list of positions should differ as they\r\ndo, is quite as likely the result of the careless way in which the\r\nminutiæ of such work were generally regarded at that day, as to any\r\ndifference of date, or of intentional modification.\r\n\r\nTo conclude our review of the instrumental means and methods then in\r\nuse, it may be said that the compasses in use at that day were\r\ncomparatively roughly made and more or less inaccurate. The variation\r\nwas determined in a given latitude by the azimuth of the Polestar or\r\nthe sun at setting observed by means of sights attached to the rim of\r\nthe compass, which was a method accurate enough for the general\r\npurposes of navigation. The distance run was measured on shipboard by\r\nthe log which was in about the same form and perfection as at present,\r\nbeing a very ancient invention.\r\n\r\nThe survey of a general coast-line was made by compass bearings on\r\nprominent points, repeated from successive stations, the distances of\r\nthe ship's course being determined by the log and the courses by\r\ncompass, with corrections for current and the variation. The lines thus\r\nobtained were checked by latitude observations made with Davis'\r\nbackstaff when the weather permitted.\r\n\r\nApart from any of the methods mentioned it seems to have been\r\noverlooked that Bering might have corrected the longitudes of the N.E.\r\nSiberian coast by the ordinary dead reckoning kept on board his vessel,\r\nprovided he started by adopting the longitude for the southern part of\r\nKamchatka peninsula which was in common use on many of the charts of\r\nhis day. Though it is true that the maps of that part of Siberia north\r\nand northeast from the Okhotsk sea were many degrees in error in the\r\nlongitude, this observation does not hold good in regard to the\r\nsouthern end of Kamchatka. The work of the Jesuit fathers in China had\r\nalready determined fairly well the position of China and Korea, while\r\nrude outlines of the northern islands of Japan, Sakhalin, the Kuriles\r\nand the south end of Kamchatka, were added to these on maps of Asia.\r\nThe outlines are often very incorrect but it is quite evident what is\r\nintended. In nearly all early maps of this region which I have been\r\nable to consult, as for instance those of N. de Witt, I have found the\r\nsouth end of Kamchatka in approximately correct longitude. For\r\ninstance, in the Novissimae Ephemerides of Manfredio, published at Bonn\r\nthe same year that Bering left St. Petersburg, and which might well\r\nhave been sent to him before he sailed, we find two charts of the paths\r\nof solar eclipses (Plates ii and iii). On these charts the meridian of\r\n180° from Ferro passes across what is unmistakably the south end of\r\nKamchatka, though northeastern Siberia remains a blank. This would be a\r\nsufficient starting point and is quite as correct as Bering's\r\ndeterminations; in fact is within a few miles of the modern longitudes\r\nfor the same part of the peninsula. Dead reckoning along the shores of\r\nthe peninsula, corrected by latitude observations, would have done all\r\nthat was necessary to correct the meridian without observing any lunar\r\neclipse, provided the surveyor started with such an assumption as\r\nManfredio's or De Witt's charts supply.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF INFORMATION.\r\n\r\nThe general History of China [etc.] Done from the French of P[ere].

The text of the original French I have not\r\nbeen able to consult, though, so far as Bering's voyage is concerned,\r\nthere does not seem to have been any material abridgment in the\r\ntranslation above cited, for an opportunity of consulting which I am\r\nindebted to the Librarian of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe maps and charts of the original French edition were separately\r\nprinted in an atlas by themselves, for the use of those who might\r\ndesire to do without the text, under the following title:\r\n\r\n\r\nNouvel Atlas de la Chine, de la Tartarie Chinoise, et du Thibet:\r\ncontenant Les Chartes générales & particulieres de ces Pays, ainsi que\r\nla Carte du Royaume de Corée; (etc.): Rédigées par M^r D'Anville,\r\nGéographe ordinaire de sa Majesté très Chrétienne, Précedé d'une\r\ndescription de la Boucharie, Par un Officier Suedois que a fait quelque\r\nsejour dans ce Pays. A la Haye, chez Henri Scheurleer MDCCXXVII. Folio,\r\n12 pp. 42 charts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chart of Bering forms sheet 42, and differs from the others in\r\nbeing on Mercator's projection which indicates that it was copied\r\ndirectly from an original as stated in the text, and not redrawn. It is\r\n20-3/4 by 9-3/8 inches on the neat-lines and is entitled:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Carte des Pays traversé par le Cap^{ne}. Beerings depuis la ville de\r\nTobolsk jusqu'a Kamtschatka.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBeneath the title is a table of four transliterated Russian terms for\r\nfort, post, village and convent, with their French equivalents. This\r\nand certain peculiarities in the transliteration of proper names make\r\nit certain that the original chart was in Russian and that the\r\ntransliteration was done by some one not perfectly familiar with both\r\nlanguages. There are a few errors of the engraver in rendering single\r\nletters \"c\" appearing for \"t\" and \"r\" for \"e\" in a few places. The\r\nlongitude is reckoned in degrees east from Tobolsk to which 67° degrees\r\nwhen added will give practically the meridian east from Greenwich. The\r\ntranscriber of the map from the Russian appears to have been a Dane, G.\r\nKondet.\r\n\r\nThat part of this chart east from 112° E. Gr. has been fairly\r\nreproduced by Lauridsen (Chart I) with the omission of some unimportant\r\nnames and the addition of a signature (not the ordinary autograph) of\r\nBering. This is reproduced with a different running headline to\r\naccompany Olson's translation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth volume of Brookes' translation (pp. 429-440) contains\r\n\r\n\"A succinct narrative of Captain Beerings's Travels into Siberia:\"\r\n\r\n\r\nwith a reduction of the above-mentioned map, on which there is no trace\r\nof the island of St. Demetrius, even its name, which alone appears on\r\nthe Du Halde map, is here omitted. Otherwise this version of the map\r\ndoes not differ from Du Halde's, more than one copy of a drawing\r\nusually differs from another. When Bering started on his expedition he\r\nwas accompanied by two cartographers (Bergh, First Voy. of the Russ.\r\npp. 2-5, fide Lauridsen) Luzhin and Potiloff, and to one or both of\r\nthem under Bering's direction the construction of the map in question\r\nwas probably due.\r\n\r\nWhen Bering made his report it was accompanied by a list of positions\r\nfor important places visited by the Expedition.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell, while gathering material for his second edition of\r\nHarris' Voyages, procured a copy of this unpublished list of positions\r\nand prints it in his account of Bering's travels, with the comment that\r\nit was sent by Bering from Kamchatka, before his return to Russia, and\r\nto the Senate at St. Petersburg, to which Bering did not report.\r\nWhether due to the transcriber or the printer there are several very\r\nobvious errors in the list as printed by Campbell, and when it is\r\ncompared with Bering's own list we see that there are also several\r\ninterpolations.\r\n\r\nBut the positions adopted in the chart, said by Du Halde to have been\r\nbrought to St. Petersburg by Bering on his return (a statement\r\nconfirmed by the mention of a chart in the report itself), are not\r\nidentical with the positions enumerated in the list. This leads to the\r\nsuspicion that Bering's first chart was not published, and that the\r\nchart issued was due to a recomputation and revision of his data. This\r\nsuspicion is made stronger by the statement of Lauridsen, who gives no\r\nauthority, however, that Bering's chart was made in Moscow in 1731,[4]\r\nthough this may merely mean that some of the copies which were\r\ndistributed to various personages were so prepared.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Lauridsen, Am. ed., p. 57.]\r\n\r\nThese manuscript copies of the chart and report were sent to various\r\nforeign courts, as a matter of general interest, by the Russian\r\nauthorities. The copy used by Du Halde was communicated to him by the\r\nKing of Poland who had received it as a \"Present worthy of his regard\r\nand curiosity\" (Du Halde, iv, p. 439, Brookes' ed.). Other copies were\r\nsent to Sweden and probably to England and other countries. In the\r\njournal, \"Ymer,\" of the Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography\r\n(1884, p. 93) is a short notice by E. Dahlgren of three manuscript\r\ncopies of Bering's chart of his first expedition, or rather of charts\r\nembodying its results. Two of these charts are in the Royal archives of\r\nSweden and measures 58 x 135 cm. One of them is ornamented with ten\r\ncolored drawings of natives of Siberia. The other is without these but\r\ndoes not seem to be a copy of the first as it has a number of soundings\r\nbetween St. Lawrence and the Diomede Islands which are not on the\r\nformer, and some names which are peculiar to it. Both have many more\r\nnames than are given on the chart published by Du Halde. Both of the\r\nmanuscripts have a legend referring to the coast from the Kolyma\r\neastward, on the north coast of Siberia, to the effect that it is put\r\ndown from older charts and information, doubtless furnished by the\r\narchives at Yakutsk. The third copy is in the possession of Baron\r\nRobert Klinckofström, of Stafsund, Sweden.\r\n\r\nThrough the kind offices of Baron Nordenskiöld and the generosity of\r\nBaron Klinckofström, the last mentioned chart has been forwarded to the\r\nwriter through the Smithsonian Institution for examination. It appears\r\nto be essentially the same as the second of the two charts referred to\r\nas comprised in the Royal Swedish Archives. The result of my\r\nexamination of it leads me to the belief that there were two different\r\ncharts sent out in manuscript by the Russian authorities. The first,\r\nwhich I regard as the earlier, and which is certainly more accurate,\r\nshows the island of St. Demetrius in its proper place in accordance\r\nwith Bering's Report and list of positions. It formed the basis of\r\nCampbell's engraving which will be referred to later, and of the chart\r\nwhich appears in the various editions of Du Halde. It is possible that\r\nthis represents the original chart prepared by Bering in Kamchatka\r\nduring the winter of 1728-9. The second and probably later form of the\r\nchart is represented by the Klinckofström chart, upon which the name\r\nand island of St. Demetrius have vanished and a smaller island in the\r\ncorresponding latitude is represented close to the Siberian coast and\r\nwestward from the meridian passing through the eastern extreme of East\r\nCape. This island is named the island of St. Diomede. If it is intended\r\nas a revised position for the island of St. Demetrius of the other\r\nchart and of Bering's Report, it is in conflict with the facts and with\r\nthe position assigned to St. Demetrius in the report. No one who had\r\nsailed between St. Demetrius and East Cape could have sanctioned such a\r\nposition for the island with honesty. If a different island is intended\r\nthe question arises, Why is St. Demetrius omitted? This second chart is\r\nobviously the basis upon which in D'Anville's chart of Asia (1753) the\r\nconfiguration of the eastern extreme of Siberia is based, and I suspect\r\nthat the chart of the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg\r\nand the reproduction of Jefferys, were also derived from it as far as\r\nthis region is concerned.\r\n\r\nIt would be rash, in the absence of authentic information which only\r\nthe Russian archives can supply, to hazard an opinion as to the origin\r\nof the important difference between these charts. I may return to this\r\npoint later. Apart from this, it may be added that the northern coast\r\nof Siberia from East Cape west to Cape Shelagskoi is represented as\r\nmountainous throughout its extent. A legend states that it is laid down\r\nfrom older charts and information. This relieves Bering from the\r\nresponsibility for the fictitious or at least grossly erroneous and\r\nexaggerated form and direction given to Cape Shelagskoi on his chart.\r\nThe west coast of the Okhotsk sea and part of its northeastern shores\r\nnot visited by Bering are stated to be laid down from \"information.\"\r\nThis map is not dated and the blank space in the title left for\r\nBering's autograph has never been filled. No name of draughtsman or\r\nplace or authority of issue are indicated upon it. It measures 51 by\r\n20-1/8 inches between the neat-lines. It is in black and white, the\r\nmountains washed in, the only color being small green trees as a\r\nconventional sign for wooded country. A copy of the earlier chart fell\r\ninto the hands of Dr. Campbell and was published by him in his edition\r\nof Harris' Voyages,[5] together with a version of the report which is\r\nmore or less mutilated and to which the editor to make his book more\r\nreadable has added certain flowers of rhetoric which detract from its\r\naccuracy. Campbell's copy of the map is the most perfect yet published\r\nand the only one showing the island of St. Demetrius in its proper\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: HARRIS, JOHN. Complete collection of Voyages and travels\r\n[etc.]. London, T. Woodward [and others] 1748. 2 v. folio, maps and\r\nplates, Vol. 2, pp. 1016-1041, is devoted to a discussion of Bering's\r\ndiscoveries, entitled: Book III, Section VIII. \"A distinct account of\r\npart of the northeast frontier of the Russian Empire, commonly called\r\nthe country of Kamschatka or Kamschatska including the voyages of\r\nCaptain Behring for discovering toward the East [etc.], collected from\r\nthe best authorities both printed and manuscript.\"]\r\n\r\nIn Du Halde's copy and those derived from it the eastern border of the\r\nchart has cut off the island, though in some of them, as in that of\r\n1736, the name remains. The only fault to be noted in Campbell's\r\nedition of Bering's map is the omission by the engraver of the small\r\nbay named Preobrazhenia by Bering and which, though it is not named,\r\nappears on the other editions of the map. The title is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"An exact chart of all the countries through which Cap^t. Behring\r\ntravelled, from Tobolski Capital of Siberia to the country of\r\nKamtschatka.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe size of the map is 7 x 12¾ inches. It extends on the east to the\r\nmeridian of 126° east from Tobolsk which enables the \"Isle of St.\r\nDemetrius\" (our present Big Diomede) to appear in its proper place. The\r\neditions previously reported have all stopped at the 124th meridian,\r\nthus cutting off the island, whose name sometimes appeared and\r\nsometimes did not.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that Dr. Campbell in this paper was the means of\r\nintroducing the erroneous and obnoxious Germanized spelling of Bering's\r\nname into English literature. This is a pretty good indication that he\r\nhad no autographic documents from Bering himself, and that his\r\nmanuscripts were obtained from German sources, or at least had been\r\ntranscribed into the German language. In his thorough search of the\r\nliterature of the subject and lengthy discussion of the results, Dr.\r\nCampbell undoubtedly gathered the fullest account of the first\r\nexpedition which had up to that date been printed. In order to enliven\r\nhis history of the proceedings, the good Doctor occasionally rises to\r\nflights of fancy, and the theories he held were long since proved\r\nerroneous.\r\n\r\nThere are several other English translations of Du Halde's China, of\r\nwhich the following is the most important:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A description of the empire of China and Chinese-Tartary, together\r\nwith the kingdoms of Korea, and Tibet: containing the geography and\r\nhistory (natural as well as civil) of those countries. From the French\r\nof P. J. B. Du Halde, Jesuit. Illustrated with general and particular\r\nmaps, and adorned with a great number of cuts. With notes geographical,\r\nhistorical and critical, and other improvements, particularly in the\r\nmaps, by the Translator.\" London, Edward Cave, 1741. 2 vols. folio,\r\nmaps and ills.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis edition does not show the name of the translator, but he was\r\nevidently a man of no small attainments as a geographer and\r\ncartographer, and introduced numerous improvements and corrections into\r\nthe charts of D'Anville, which accompanied the original edition of Du\r\nHalde. A copy of this was presented to the library of Harvard College\r\nby the province of New Hampshire in 1765-6, for an opportunity of\r\nexamining which I am indebted to the courtesy of Mr. Justin Winsor, the\r\nLibrarian.\r\n\r\nThe text of this edition, compared with that of 1736, is as much as\r\npossible abridged, yet contains nothing not in the original, but the\r\nmap exhibits certain additions to be noted. This map is entitled,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A Map of Capt. Beerings' travels from Tobolskoy to Kamchatka between\r\ny^e years 1725 and 1730. With improvements by y^e Editor.\" It contains\r\nthe following note by the editor. \"Capt. Beerings probably observ'd y^e\r\nLat.^d in y^e Principal places thro' w^{ch} he pass'd, tho' two\r\nObservations only are mentioned in his Journal. But M^r Kyrilow in his\r\nMap of the Russian Empire does not follow y^e Author in this respect\r\nfor instance he places Ilimski 1° 30' more north, Yakutskoy 2° more\r\nsouth, and Cape Chiokotskago 1° more south than Cap^t. Beerings;\r\nlikewise other places in Proportion. I have reckon'd y^e Long^d of\r\nTobolskoy from Paris according to an Eclipse of y^e Sun observed at\r\nHamburg and Tobolskoy, mentioned by Mr. Strahlenberg in his account of\r\ny^e Northern parts of Europe and Asia. This is all that can be done\r\ntill y^e return of y^e Russian Mathematicians sent to make observations\r\nand discoveries throughout Siberia.\" Then follows a line \"Inscribed to\r\nFrancis Gashrey Esq^r.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main body of the chart is that of Du Halde's original and the scale\r\nis the same, but the height of the neat-lines is only 8-5/8 inches.\r\nBering's track from Okhotsk to Bolsheretsk, across Kamchatka, northward\r\nto 67° 18'; also his track eastward from Kamchatka in 1729 and around\r\nthe peninsula to Bolsheretsk and Okhotsk; are indicated by dotted\r\nlines. The two latitudes noted in Bering's journal are indicated on\r\nthis map by a +, and the northern one is placed near the Asiatic coast\r\nin latitude 118° E. from Tobolsk. At the top of the map the supposed\r\nParis meridians[6] are indicated, a difference between Paris and\r\nTobolsk being assumed of 70° degrees, which is about five degrees too\r\nmuch. There are also sundry infelicities in the transliteration of the\r\nnames from the French of D'Anville.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: In the Campbell map these are taken as east from London\r\nwith an allowance of 67° between London and Tobolsk.]\r\n\r\nA chart which deserves notice, though almost wholly fictitious, being\r\nchiefly devoted to the spurious discoveries of the alleged Admiral de\r\nFonte, was issued by J. N. de L'Isle with the concurrence of M. P.\r\nBuache, or at his suggestion. It appeared at Paris, in 1752, and was\r\ncopied for Jefferys' (2d) edition of Voyages from Asia to America in\r\n1764. I do not know if this copy appeared in the first edition, but\r\npresume it did.\r\n\r\nFor present purposes the interesting features of this map are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nOpposite the eastern extreme of the Chukchi peninsula there is\r\nrepresented part of America with the legend, \"Terres vues par Mr.\r\nSpanberg in 1728, frequentées à présent par les Russes, qui en\r\napportent de très belles fourrures.\" In the English edition the legend\r\nis \"Seen by Spanberg 1728.\" Four islands are represented in the strait\r\nbetween Asia and America, corresponding in a general way to the four\r\nnow known to exist there. Connected with America and north of the\r\nChukchi peninsula is land with an island off it corresponding not badly\r\nto Wrangell and Herald Islands, and marked \"Discovered in 1722.\" It is\r\npossible that this land is a hypothetical compound of the land reported\r\nby the Chukchis east of the strait with that which they knew to be\r\nvisible in clear weather from Cape Yakan, more or less confused\r\naccounts of which had long been current among persons interested in\r\nthese regions.\r\n\r\nThe next chart of note in this connection was published by D'Anville,\r\nthe royal geographer of France, who had previously prepared the\r\noriginal map of Bering for publication. He issued a general map of\r\nAsia, in three parts, each of two leaves which could be joined\r\ntogether, of which the first part appeared in 1751 and the third part\r\nin 1753, entitled:\r\n\r\n\r\nTroisième Partie de la Carte/d'Asie,/contenant/La Sibérie/et quelques\r\nautres parties/de la Tartarie,/Publiée sous les Auspices de\r\nMonseigneur/Louis-Philippe d'Orléans/Duc d'Orléans/Prémier Prince du\r\nSang./Par le S^r. d'Anville,/Sécrétaire de Son Alt^s.\r\nSereniss^s./MDCCLIII./Avec Privilége./\r\n\r\n\r\nThis map is in two sheets (each 20 x 21 inches), the engraving of the\r\ngeographical part by Guill. de la Haye and of the ornamental title by\r\nDe Lafosse. The longitude is reckoned from Ferro, and the map is\r\nconstructed on a scale of 23 French leagues to 60 geographical miles.\r\nThe boundaries are colored and the sea shore shaded with short\r\nhorizontal lines. It is on the polyconic projection.\r\n\r\nThis map includes many of the additions to geography in eastern Siberia\r\nwhich were due to the members of the great Siberian expedition. The\r\ncourses and branches of the rivers especially were augmented and\r\ncorrected as well as named. The branches of the Anadyr River were\r\nrepresented and named, but as no new information in regard to the coast\r\nhad been received at that date, this river was still mapped as entering\r\nthe sea to the south and west of Cape Thaddeus, as erroneously laid\r\ndown by Bering, who confounded with the Anadyr a small river which does\r\ncome in here, and passed the estuary of the true Anadyr without seeing\r\nit. The coast lines are essentially those of Bering. Beyond the basins\r\nof the Kolyma and Anadyr is marked \"Terre inconnue\"; a small supplement\r\nin the north-east corner of the map, on half the scale of the map,\r\nrepresents the north-east extreme of Asia as delineated by Bering. This\r\nlittle supplement is of considerable interest as it gives fuller\r\ninformation than that which appears on the original publication of Du\r\nHalde, perhaps from a more modern version of Bering's chart, as\r\npreviously suggested.\r\n\r\nSeveral names appear for the first time in cartographic history, upon\r\nthis map. Preobrazhenia Bay; Bolshoia River falling into Holy Cross\r\nBay, and the \"Isle de St. Diomide\" are among these. The Island of St.\r\nDemetrius is omitted, as well as its name. The Island of St. Diomide is\r\nplaced about on a line between East Cape and Cape Chukotski, to the\r\nwestward of the meridian of East Cape. There is a discrepancy averaging\r\nabout five minutes in latitude and longitude between the positions on\r\nthis map and those on the second version of the Bering manuscript\r\ncharts. But in the main these differences are, I suspect, merely due to\r\ncarelessness in copying, and the general harmony between the two leads\r\nto the belief that the D'Anville outline for this region was based on\r\nthe second version of the manuscript.\r\n\r\nThe differences of position for points on this part of the coast are\r\nnumerous. I have noted them in the comparative table of positions\r\nherewith. They may be chiefly owing to slips in transferring from the\r\nMercator to the Polyconic projection; but some of them are due to new\r\ninformation, probably derived from the surveyors of the second\r\nexpedition. Bering island appears on the map, in about its proper\r\nplace, though Copper island is not indicated, nor are any of the\r\nAleutians shown. I suspect this is the first publication of a\r\ncartographic kind on which Bering island is laid down, as the map of\r\nthe Imperial Academy of Sciences, embodying the geographical results of\r\nBering's Voyage to the coast of America, was not engraved until a year\r\nlater, while De L'Isle's of 1752 does not contain them.\r\n\r\nThe island between Cape Shelaginski and East Cape off the northern\r\ncoast, on Bering's map, is omitted by D'Anville. The Kamchatkan\r\npeninsula in latitude 56° is represented to have a width of 180 miles,\r\nwhile Bering made it 270 miles.\r\n\r\nA most important contribution to the subject appeared in Müller's\r\nHistorical Collections known as the \"Sammlung Russische Geschichte\" and\r\npublished at St. Petersburg (Kayserl. Academie der Wissenschaften,\r\n1732-64. 8°. Nine volumes.) Des dritten Bandes (erstes, zweytes und\r\ndrittes Stück, pp. 1-304, 1758) contains the original account of the\r\nRussian Voyages toward America from which the work of Jefferys has,\r\nwith some errors and omissions, been translated. As far as regards\r\nBering's first voyage, there is only one error of consequence made by\r\nJefferys, which will be noted in its place. This book is extremely\r\nrare, and the only copy in America which I have been able to find after\r\nmuch enquiry, is in the library of the Smithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\nThe first volume of this series has the title\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Eröffnung eines Vorschlages zu Verbesserung der Russischen Historie\r\nDurch den Druck eines Stückweise herauszugebenden Sammelungen von\r\nallerly zu den Umstanden und Begebenheiten dieses Reichs gehorigen\r\nNachrichten. St. Petersburg, bey der Keyserl. Academie der\r\nWissenschaften, 1732.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe succeeding volumes have the running title \"Sammlung Russische\r\nGeschichte\" with the number of the parts subjoined but no other\r\ntitle-page.\r\n\r\nThe account of the Russian Voyages is stated by Müller to have been\r\nprepared at the direction of the Empress and endorsed by the Academy of\r\nSciences. It contains invaluable material on the early explorations,\r\nwhich, if it had not been for Müller's painstaking researches, would\r\nhave been totally lost, as the archives of Yakutsk from whence the data\r\nwere derived by Müller were subsequently destroyed by fire. The errors\r\nwhich occur in it are chiefly due to Müller's endeavor to utilize the\r\ninexact geographical data of the Promyschleniks and Cossacks by\r\ncombining them with the less detailed but more precise observations of\r\nlater observers. In this attempt he added many valuable details to the\r\ncharts, but at the same time introduced several errors. The exaggerated\r\ndistances reported by the first explorers who were unable to correct\r\ntheir estimates by observations of precision, distort those parts of\r\nthe map due to their reports. The peninsula of Aliaska becomes hugely\r\nexaggerated as does the Shelagskoi promontory on the Arctic Sea. But no\r\nunprejudiced person can read Müller's account without perceiving his\r\ngreat caution in accepting unreservedly these imperfect contributions,\r\nthe really important additions which he made to cartography, the\r\npreciousness of the facts which he rescued from oblivion, and his\r\ndesire to be fair to everybody.\r\n\r\nThe insinuations of malice and of a desire to injure Bering by means of\r\nthis account given by Müller, which Lauridsen attributes to the latter,\r\nappear to be entirely the product of a suspicious temperament and an\r\nexcited imagination. Certainly I have seen nothing anywhere cited which\r\nlends to such suspicions any tint of probability. The facts cited in\r\nsupport of them can easily be otherwise explained, if one desires to\r\nview the subject judicially, and for the most part are not quite\r\nthoroughly understood by the Danish author.\r\n\r\nOne error upon which the latter lays great stress, is due to a\r\nmanipulation of the record, originated or at least adopted by Bering\r\nhimself, and which is incorporated in the map and report which all\r\nauthors agree proceeded directly from Bering's own hand.\r\n\r\nThe next map of importance was issued by the Imperial Academy of\r\nSciences, St. Petersburg in 1754. It was made under the inspection of\r\nGerhard Friedrich, Staatsrath von Müller, who revised and corrected it\r\nsubsequently, when an edition dated 1758 was issued. This map comprised\r\nthe geographical results of the great Siberian expedition sent out by\r\nthe Russian government; of Bering's voyages; and of the records of the\r\nhunters (Promishleniks) and traders in northeastern Siberia preserved\r\nin the archives of Yakutsk. The sources of this map are fully explained\r\nby Müller in the \"Russian Discoveries\" (Jefferys' translation, p. 108\r\net seq.). I have not been able to examine a copy of the original map,\r\nand have therefore relied on the English version of it which is to be\r\nfound in Jefferys' translation, second edition, London, 1764.\r\n\r\nAmong the improvements introduced on this map may be specified, the\r\ncorrection of the shores of the Okhotsk Sea, and Gulf of Penjina, the\r\ncorrecter location of the mouth of the Anadyr river and its estuary,\r\nthe introduction of the results of the voyages of Gvosdeff, Bering and\r\nChirikoff to the northwest coast of America, and a multitude of details\r\nrelating to northeastern Siberia. The island of St. Deomid (Diomede) is\r\nnot represented though its name appears on the 65th parallel in Bering\r\nStrait. The island may have been on the original map and carelessly\r\nomitted by Jefferys' engraver on his copy. Among the errors, or rather\r\nmistaken hypotheses of others, which are suggested in this map by\r\ndotted lines, are the extension westward to 174° E. of Greenwich, of\r\nthe peninsula of Aliaska which is also given a wholly uncalled-for\r\nwidth; and the northward extension of the coast on each side of Bering\r\nStrait. In the former case the cartographer was misled by the errors of\r\nthe map of Bering and Chirikoff's last voyage and rumors reported by\r\nother navigators; and in the second case he followed Bering in adopting\r\nan erroneous position and exaggerated form for the coast eastward from\r\nKoliuchin Bay, due to the uncorrected sketches of the Cossacks and\r\ntraders. The northern extension of the American coast opposite, was\r\npurely hypothetical and for this Müller must be held responsible. Many\r\nof the western Aleutians are exaggerated in size and erroneous in\r\nposition but the chart of Bering's last voyage, and the exaggerated\r\nreports of the hunters who followed him, must be held responsible for\r\nthis, in the main.\r\n\r\nThe work in which this chart appears is largely derived from Müller's\r\n\"Sammlung russische geschichte,\" St. Petersburg, 1758, vol. iii, Parts\r\nI-III (cf. antea). The first edition is entitled, according to\r\nbibliographies:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Voyages from Asia to America for completing the discoveries of the\r\nnorthwest coast of America.

To which is prefixed, a summary of the\r\nVoyages made by the Russians on the Frozen Sea, in search of a\r\nnortheast passage. Serving as an explanation of a map of the Russian\r\ndiscoveries, published by the Academy of Sciences at Petersburgh,\r\n[etc.] London: T. Jefferys, 1764,\" viii, 120 pp. 4°, four maps.\r\n\r\n\r\nA French translation by Dumas, with the author's initials misprinted G.\r\nP. instead of G. F., was printed at Amsterdam in 1766. It consisted of\r\ntwo volumes, 18mo, with a map. A Danish translation, by Morten\r\nHallager, was issued at Copenhagen in 1784, as a portion of a volume\r\nrelating to northern explorations. Bibliographers seem to have been\r\npuzzled by the discrepancy of initials, not recognizing that the S. in\r\nJefferys' volume stood for a title and not a name. Another work\r\nimportant in its collection of facts bearing upon the general question\r\nof the explorations eastward by the Russians, was published by the\r\narchdeacon of Wilts, Rev. William Coxe in 1780. This was followed by a\r\nsecond edition during the same year. A third edition accompanied by a\r\nSupplement of 57 pages was printed in 1787 and a fourth in 1803. There\r\nwere two apparently distinct translations of the book printed at Paris\r\nin 1781, and a German edition at Frankfurt and Leipzig in 1783. The\r\nthird edition which is the best and most correct appeared both in\r\noctavo and quarto form, and is that to which reference is made in this\r\npaper. It is entitled:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Account of the Russian discoveries between Asia and America. To which\r\nare added the Conquest of Siberia, and the history of the transactions\r\nand commerce between Russia and China, [etc.]. London: T. Cadell,\r\n1787.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n410 pp. 8° [or 4°] with four charts and one plate; to which is added,\r\nconsecutively paged:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A comparative view of the Russian discoveries with those made by\r\nCaptains Cook and Clerke, and a sketch of what remains to be\r\nascertained by future navigators. London: T. Cadell, 1787.\" 3 l. unp.,\r\n417-456 pp. 8°.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latter was also separately issued. Among the maps contained in this\r\nwork of Coxe's are a reduced copy of the general map of Russia issued\r\nby the Imperial Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, 1776, and a chart\r\nof Synd's Voyage toward Chukotski Noss.\r\n\r\nThe latter is the only chart of Synd's voyage (1764-1768) which is\r\naccessible, and it is vouched for as authentic by Dr. Coxe. Compared\r\nwith later charts it is, of course, extremely imperfect yet there is in\r\nit enough resemblance to the truth to enable us to recognize what was\r\nintended in many instances. In the northeastern part of the chart, the\r\nlatitudes are exaggerated and the longitudes contracted in a very\r\nerroneous manner. Nevertheless we recognize East Cape, here named\r\n\"Prom. Tschukotskoi;\" the two islands now called the Diomedes but here\r\nleft nameless; a large island, moved eastward out of place, but\r\ndoubtless intended for Arakam Island, is called \"I. Diomedis;\" while\r\namong a crowd of islets (referable to the hills of St. Lawrence Island\r\nseen through a fog and laid down very inaccurately), the name \"S.\r\nDiomedis\" appears again. The American coast was seen and landed upon;\r\nCape Prince of Wales and the shore south and east from it are\r\nrecognizable. The island of St. Mathew was discovered and named, though\r\nplaced a degree too far south. The island of St. Paul in the Pribiloff\r\ngroup was discovered by Synd, put in its true latitude, and named\r\nPreobrazhenia or Transfiguration Island. It is about seven degrees out\r\nin relative longitude and fourteen in absolute longitude. One cannot\r\ndoubt however that it was the island now known as St. Paul when we\r\nrecall the fact that there are no other islands than the Pribiloff\r\ngroup, in that latitude or within that general area of Bering Sea. The\r\nsouthern Cape of the Chukchi Peninsula, Chukotski Cape of Bering and\r\nMüller is represented two degrees too far south. Preobrazhenia Bay is\r\nnot recognizable but the name is transferred to the bight west and\r\nnorth of Cape Bering of our present charts. This part of the coast was\r\nnot however approached by Synd, who spent much time on the coast of\r\nKamchatka. On his chart this peninsula is represented better than we\r\nshould have expected from the rudeness of the rest.\r\n\r\nThe map of the Academy shows the influence of those who discredited the\r\nnear approach of America to eastern Siberia; notwithstanding the\r\nexplorations of Deshneff, Gvosdeff and Synd, the American shore of\r\nBering Strait has disappeared altogether. The eastern portion of the\r\nChukchi Peninsula is indented by a host of hypothetical inlets, and\r\ndefended by an unrecognizable archipelago of nameless islands. The\r\nfar-stretching chain of islands, among which Bering's second expedition\r\nwas so long entangled, excepting those confirmed by Krenitzen and\r\nLevasheff (who sailed far north of the southern arc of the chain) is\r\nalso absent. Excepting that the fictitious peninsula north from Chukchi\r\nland is effaced, the map in its main features for this region is less\r\naccurate than that of Bering, and does not compare very favorably with\r\nthat of Müller. And yet but shortly after its publication, the\r\nexplorations of Cook and Clerke recorded the facts which should, when\r\npublished, exalt the memory of the older geographers and scatter the\r\nhypotheses which for a time prevailed against them.\r\n\r\nTheir explorations are included in\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A voyage to the Pacific Ocean, undertaken by the command of his\r\nMajesty, for making discoveries in the northern hemisphere, [etc.],\r\nperformed under the direction of captains Cook, Clerke and Gore, in his\r\nMajesty's ships the Resolution and Discovery, in the years 1776-1780.\r\nLondon, for T. Nicol and T. Cadell, 1784-5.\" 3 volumes 4° and atlas\r\nfolio.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the edition ordered by the Admiralty. Of this celebrated work,\r\nsaid to have been written from the explorers' manuscripts by Bishop\r\nDouglas, there have been many editions. In the Bulletin of the Société\r\nde Géographie, Paris, 1879, pp. 481-540, is a bibliography by James\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting points in regard to Cook's explorations about\r\nBering Strait are comprised on the chart (vol. ii, p. 467) entitled:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Chart of Norton Sound and of Bherings Strait made by the East Cape of\r\nAsia and the west point of America.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this chart the main features of the coast on either side of the\r\nstrait are correctly indicated, though several of the inlets and bays\r\nare wanting. The Diomedes and Fairway Rock of modern charts are located\r\nbut left without names, King's Island is named; Arakam was not\r\nrecognized as an island nor was Point Chaplin (Indian Point) observed.\r\nSt. Lawrence Island was seen in foggy weather. Its isolated hills\r\nconnected by very low flat land led Cook into the error of supposing\r\nthat it comprised several islands, one of which he correctly referred\r\nto that named St. Lawrence by Bering and the rest he lumped under the\r\nname of Clerke's Islands. A single fictitious island, midway between\r\nSt. Lawrence and King's appears on the chart, but is not named or\r\nmentioned in the text. St. Lawrence Bay is named and discovered. Bering\r\nand Müller's Chukotski cape is correctly identified. East Cape is well\r\ndelineated, and the name Serdze Kamen (Heart-Rock) originally given to\r\na cliff or bluff point at the entrance of Holy Cross Bay is transferred\r\nto a point on the Arctic shore of the peninsula. There is a confused\r\nand somewhat curious history connected with the use of the names\r\nSerdze-Kamen and Chukotski Cape. After the travels of Deshneff, Popoff\r\nand others and the reception at various times of information from the\r\nnatives, it was pretty generally understood among the hunters and\r\ntraders of this region that the extreme of Asia was a cape or point on\r\nor near which the Chukchi dwelt, or which they described, which was not\r\ndefinitely located, and which was vaguely known as the Chukchi Cape or\r\nthe Cape of the Chukchis, Chukotski Noss in the Russian tongue. Cape\r\nSerdze Kamen will be found on the chart of Billings' Voyage. It was the\r\npoint where the Chukchis successfully defended themselves against the\r\ninvading Russians who sought to force them to pay tribute. Beyond it,\r\nfor the Russians all was mysterious Chukchi country with an unknown\r\ncoast. This cape being their _ne plus ultra_ it is probable that it was\r\nmore or less confounded by these illiterate and ignorant hunters with\r\nthe supposed eastern Cape of Asia, otherwise the Cape of the Chukchis\r\nas used by Müller. Admit this and it is not difficult to frame an\r\nhypothesis which shall account for the confusion, without recourse to\r\nthe absurd charges with which Lauridsen attempts to soil the reputation\r\nof Müller, Steller and others.\r\n\r\nWhen Bering named a cape near which he met a baidar-load of Chukchi who\r\ngave him some geographical information (among other things that the\r\ncoast made a turn after passing it) he called this cape with great\r\npropriety the Cape of the Chukchis, as observed by Cook (ii, p. 474)\r\nand with no reference to the legendary Cape of the Chukchis above\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nBut when Müller and others more familiar with the records of the\r\nearlier explorers came to make maps, they naturally applied the\r\nlegendary name to the cape which they supposed to be the eastern end of\r\nAsia, and beyond which the coast makes a turn to the west. Müller\r\nbelieving in a great cape or peninsula on the northern coast of the\r\nChukchi country supposed this to be the true Cape Chukotski, and to the\r\neastern Cape of Bering he left the name of Serdze-Kamen, probably\r\nknowing little about the original Cape Serdze. And as Bering, by the\r\nambiguity of his journal, gave color to the idea that he had rounded\r\nEast Cape and pursued the north coast west of it for a few hours before\r\nturning homeward, what more natural than that those little acquainted\r\nwith the region should speak of his turning back from near\r\nSerdze-Kamen? Thus Cook, following out the same idea derived from his\r\nstudy of the map and journal in Harris, transferred the name to a point\r\nin the latitude at which Bering turned back, on the coast which he\r\nsupposed him to have surveyed. There is plenty of confusion here but no\r\njust ground for supposing malice in it.\r\n\r\nA publication which throws much light upon Bering's voyage of 1728 was\r\nprinted by Vasili Nikolaievich Bergh (or Berkh) a well known writer on\r\ngeographical matters in connection with Russian history. It is in the\r\nRussian language and the title may be translated as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Sea Voyages of the Russians undertaken for the settlement of this\r\ngeographical problem--Are Asia and America united?--and performed in\r\n1727, 28 and 29, under the command of fleet captain of the first rank,\r\nVitus Bering. To which is added a short biographical account of Captain\r\nBering and some of his officers. St. Petersburg, Academical printing\r\noffice, 1823. 8°. 3 pr. l. iv, 126 pp. 1 map. Russian text.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book was printed, as many private books are, at the printing\r\noffice of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, but was not published or\r\nprinted by the Academy. The only copies I know of are those in the\r\nlibrary of the Academy and one in the British Museum library, neither\r\nof which I have been able personally to consult. But through the kind\r\noffices of Dr. S. Hertzenstein, of the Zoological Museum of the\r\nAcademy, I learn that Bergh found in the Archives of the State\r\nAdmiralty Department the logbook of midshipman Peter Chaplin entitled,\r\n\"Midshipman Peter Chaplin's journal of the Kamchatka expedition of\r\n1725-1731.\" From this MSS and from the notes of G. F. Müller and\r\nAdmiral Nagaieff, Bergh compiled his work. Chaplin's journal is not\r\nreprinted verbatim but only paraphrased by Bergh who adds his own\r\ncommentary on the subject matter, and occasionally gives extracts from\r\nChaplin whose logbook seems to have been kept in a model way.\r\n\r\nAn effort will be made to obtain a copy of the original logbook,[7] but\r\nfor the present we are obliged to be content with what of authenticity\r\nremains to the data which have been translated or paraphrased by Bergh,\r\nLauridsen and Olson, necessarily submitting to more or less\r\nmodification in the process.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Simultaneously with the proofs of this paper the work of\r\nBergh has been communicated to me through the liberality of the\r\nUniversity of Upsala, Sweden. The results of a critical examination of\r\nit will form the subject of a later paper as the present publication\r\ncannot be delayed.]\r\n\r\nThe most authentic and important document for the history of this\r\nvoyage is naturally the official report handed in by Bering himself and\r\nprinted in the Journal of the Military Topographical Depot of the\r\nRussian Army, volume x, pp. 67-79, St. Petersburg, 1847.\r\n\r\nThis journal is a quarto and the report is printed _verbatim et\r\nliteratim_ if one may judge by the archaic and mispelled words with\r\nwhich it is adorned. It comprises Bering's report including his\r\ninstructions, a table of geographical positions, and a painfully\r\ndetailed table of routes and distances by which his position in\r\nKamchatka was computed. This report has never been translated in full\r\nand unmodified, the original is thought to have been lost. The present\r\npublication is not referred to by Lauridsen and was apparently unknown\r\nto him. I have therefore thought it worth while to prepare an English\r\nversion of the report and geographical table which are incorporated in\r\nthis paper.\r\n\r\nThe result shows that the previous versions of the report which have\r\nappeared were more or less mutilated or colored by the editors printing\r\nthem, probably with the view of making the report of more popular\r\ninterest to their readers but with injurious results to its historic\r\nvalue for reference.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the latest contributions to the subject. If it were not\r\nfor the deficiencies in them, which seem to me serious, this paper\r\nwould not have been prepared, but it seemed to be a pity that the\r\nsources of information in regard to Bering, accessible to those who do\r\nnot read Russian should not be both more impartial and more accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\nVitus J.

Small 4°, six prel. l. 211 pp., 4 sheets\r\nof charts, one plate, one wood-cut.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work is an attempt at a life of Bering which should combine an\r\naccount of his career with a reversal of the generally received opinion\r\nin regard to his indecision of character. It embodies a general polemic\r\nagainst those who at different times have criticised the explorer. It\r\ncontains a paraphrase of some portions of Bergh's work which had not\r\npreviously been accessible in any language except the Russian, yet\r\nwhich would have been much more valuable in the shape of exact\r\ntranslation and quotation. The author labored under the disadvantages\r\nof not understanding the language in which all the original records\r\nboth printed and in manuscript are written; of having little or no\r\nfamiliarity with nautical surveying or cartography; and of being\r\napparently unacquainted with the best modern charts of the region. His\r\ncriticisms of others are couched in very heated and not altogether\r\nparliamentary language, and he is the victim of a narrow spirit of\r\nnationalism which is sometimes mistaken for patriotism. Nevertheless he\r\nhas brought together a great deal of information; it is evident, in\r\nspite of his violent criticisms, that he has not intended to be unfair,\r\nsince he puts on record in several instances evidence damaging to his\r\nown views which would not otherwise have come to light; and he has\r\ncertainly exhibited Bering's valuable qualities in a manner which will\r\ndo much towards rehabilitating his reputation.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: I may take opportunity in this place of replying to\r\ncertain criticisms of Mr. Lauridsen on the chronological chapter of my\r\nwork on Alaska and its Resources published in 1870.\r\n\r\nThat chapter was and was stated in its introductory paragraph to be a\r\ncompilation from the authorities on the subject. It contained no\r\noriginal matter except that relating to explorations subsequent to\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nFor Bering's two voyages I consulted the report on the Russian\r\nDiscoveries printed by order of the Empress and under the auspices of\r\nthe Imperial Academy of Sciences at St. Petersburg, prepared by the\r\ndistinguished geographer Müller, himself a member of the second\r\nexpedition and personally acquainted with the actors in those scenes.\r\nNo more authoritative printed document exists on the subject. The\r\nsupposed errors animadverted upon by Mr. Lauridsen are either taken\r\ndirectly from Müller, or are inferences drawn from his report. Some of\r\nthem the critic has misunderstood or misconstrued, which from the\r\nnecessarily extreme condensation of my table is particularly easy. The\r\nexpression of surprise that Bering passed through Bering Strait without\r\nseeing the Diomedes, was warranted by the fact that Bering nowhere\r\nmentions their name or speaks of seeing any islands in their location,\r\nnor are they on his earliest printed charts. This point, however, will\r\nbe more fully dealt with later. If I were to re-write that chapter I\r\nshould probably modify the criticisms of Bering's character which\r\nappear in it; but at the time it was written I was fresh from four\r\nyears' exploration in the same region, and was particularly impressed\r\nwith his failure to secure better results when to do so would have been\r\nso easy, as well as directly in the line of his duty.]\r\n\r\n\r\nReview: Bulletin of the American Geographical Society for 1885.

I. BERING.\r\n\r\nOn February 5 of the late year 1725 I received from her Imperial\r\nMajesty the Empress Ekaterina Alexievna, of happy and well-deserving\r\nmemory, the autographic instructions of his Imperial Majesty Peter the\r\nGreat, of happy and well-deserving memory, a copy of which is hereunto\r\naffixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Instructions._\r\n\r\n(1.) There should be built on the Kamchatka [River], or at some other\r\nplace adjacent, one or two boats with decks.\r\n\r\n(2.) With these boats [you are directed] to sail along the coast which\r\nextends northwards and which is supposed (since no one knows the end of\r\nit) to be continuous with America.\r\n\r\n(3.) And therefore [you are directed] to seek the point where it\r\nconnects with America and to go to some settlement under European rule,\r\nor if any European vessel is seen, learn of it what the coast visited\r\nis called, which should be taken down in writing, an authentic account\r\nprepared, placed on the chart and brought back here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following were the instructions given me by the former General\r\nAdmiral Count Apraxin, in which were written: \"Artisans, laborers and\r\nwhatever, in my opinion, is necessary for the expedition, are to be\r\ndemanded from the chancellor's office of the government of Tobolsk and\r\nmonthly reports sent to the Imperial Admiralty College.\"\r\n\r\nBefore receiving these instructions, January 24, a lieutenant and 26\r\nmen of my command had been ordered to service on the expedition by the\r\nAdmiralty College with the necessary equipment for 25 wagons. The whole\r\nnumber of my command sent out amounted to 33 men who were ordered to\r\nVologdie and from St. Petersburg to Tobolsk by a route which passed\r\nthrough the towns here named: through Vologdie, Totma, Upper Ustiuk,\r\nSolwichergodsk, Kaigorodok, Solkamsk, Verkhoturia, Turinsk, Epanchin\r\nand Tiumen.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th day of March we arrived at Tobolsk and were there until the\r\n15th day of May because of the lateness of the season interfering with\r\ntravel. During the delay at Tobolsk requisitions were made for the\r\nnecessary outfit for the expedition.\r\n\r\nMay 15th we left Tobolsk by water down the Irtish to Samarovska Yama,\r\non four boats of the kind called by the Siberians \"dostcheniki,\" on\r\nwhich were loaded all the outfit brought from St. Petersburg or\r\nobtained at Tobolsk; together with a chaplain, commissary, sub-officers\r\nand thirty-four soldiers.\r\n\r\nI had previously sent a garde-marine officer, on a small boat furnished\r\nby the Tobolsk authorities in obedience to the orders of the Naval\r\nCollege, to the proper settlements where the preparation of\r\nfreight-boats had been ordered on the Yenisei and Uskut rivers, and I\r\nordered him to sail to Yakutsk.\r\n\r\nFrom Samarovska Yama the Obi river was ascended to Surgut and to Narim,\r\nand thence the Ket river to Makovska post. From Tobolsk to Makovska as\r\nwe traveled live Ostiaks who were formerly idolaters, but, since the\r\nyear 1715, through the labors of the Metropolitan of Tobolsk they have\r\nbeen converted to the true faith. From Makovska post to Yeniseisk the\r\nroute lay overland. From Yeniseisk to the Ilima-mouth we proceeded also\r\nin four boats by way of the Yenisei and Tunguska rivers. On the\r\nTunguska there are three rapids and several shoals; rapids be it\r\nunderstood where across the whole width of the river large rocks stand\r\nhigh in the water, with a passage only in one or two places; and\r\nshoals, similarly under water and above water but composed of small\r\nstones, alternate with rapids and with places where the water in the\r\nriver is shallow for the distance of one or two versts, and which are\r\nnot surmounted without a great deal of labor. From Yeniseisk in\r\npursuance of orders from Tobolsk we took thirty men, carpenters and\r\nsmiths.\r\n\r\nOn the Ilima river, on account of rapids, bars and shoal water, the\r\nbarges could not be taken to Ilimsk. For a certain distance only small\r\ncanoes were available, for which reason the heaviest part of the outfit\r\nwas reserved to be sent by sledges in winter.\r\n\r\nLieut. Spanberg, with a party of thirty-nine carpenters and laborers,\r\nwent by land from Ilimsk by the Uskut to the river Lena, to prepare\r\nduring the winter fifteen barges on which the command and its equipment\r\nshould be floated down to Yakutsk. I remained with the rest of the\r\nparty near Ilimsk just below the Uskut, because at Ilimsk there are few\r\nhouses and on account of the difficulties involved in a winter journey\r\nto Yakutsk, from the deficiencies of transportation, the deep snow and\r\nthe severe cold, which prevented us from proceeding.\r\n\r\nTo these reasons [was added] the necessity, according to the orders\r\nfrom the authorities at Tobolsk, of drawing the provisions for the\r\nexpedition from Irkutsk and from Ilimsk down to Yakutsk because at the\r\nlatter place grain is not cultivated. During our wintering at Ilimsk I\r\nmade a sledge journey to Irkutsk to advise with the local Voivod who\r\nhad previously been Voivod at Yakutsk and who understood what would be\r\nneeded by us in transporting our outfit from Yakutsk to Okhotsk and\r\nKamchatka, since I did not possess any actual information in regard to\r\nthat region. During the last days of winter travel I went over to the\r\nUskut and obtained from Irkutsk twenty additional carpenters and smiths\r\nfor the work of the expedition and two coopers from Ilimsk.\r\n\r\nOn the Tunguska, Ilima and Lena rivers to the Vitim live the so-called\r\nTunguses, people who own reindeer which they use as draught animals,\r\nwhile those who do not own deer live near the rivers on fish and travel\r\nin canoes made of birch bark. These people are idolaters.\r\n\r\nFrom Uskutsk on fifteen barges, in the spring of 1726, we descended the\r\nLena to Yakutsk. From the river Vitim down to the Lena, on both banks\r\nlive Yakuts with a smaller proportion of Tunguses. The Yakuts possess\r\nherds of cattle, plenty of horses and cows by which they subsist, and\r\nare contented with the product of their herds, depending but little on\r\nfish except where their cattle are too few. They pay an idolatrous\r\nreverence to the sun and moon as well as to birds, such as the swan,\r\neagle and crow. They also hold in great honor their own fortunetellers,\r\nknown hereabouts as _shamani_, each of whom owns small idols or figures\r\nwhich they call _shaitan_. By their own account these people are of\r\nTartar origin.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Yakutsk in boats I required the aid of all the people of my\r\ncommand. Thirteen flat-bottomed barges which had been constructed at\r\nUskutsk, under Lieut. Spanberg, proceeded by water on the Lena down to\r\nthe Aldan to ascend that river, the Maya and the upper Yudoma. Such a\r\ncargo could hardly have been transported to that distance overland on\r\nhorseback where but little in the way of subsistence was obtainable\r\nfrom land or water. The Cross of Yudoma might only be reached with\r\ngreat difficulty, but if successful the expense would be less than if\r\nthe material had been carried on the backs of horses. I myself with a\r\nfew people crossed from Yakutsk to Okhotsk with pack horses, as is the\r\ngeneral custom. The load or pack taken is only about five puds to one\r\nhorse, less than by the telega [ordinary cart], the deep mire and high\r\nmountains to be traversed not permitting more, though my supplies\r\namounted to 1600 puds. At the post called Okhotsk is a Russian village\r\nof only ten houses, and Lieut. Chirikoff was left to winter at Yakutsk\r\nwith orders to come overland to the Okhotsk post in the spring.\r\n\r\nIn the last days of December, 1726, a message asking for assistance was\r\nreceived from Lieut. Spanberg, who had been dispatched by the river,\r\nsaying that the boats had failed to get within 450 versts of Yudoma\r\nCross and were frozen in on the Gorbeh River, where he was transporting\r\nby sledges a cargo of outfit indispensable to our party. I sent at\r\nonce, from among those who were wintering with me at the post of\r\nOkhotsk, a party with dogs and supplies and brought in the Lieutenant\r\nto the post on the first day of January, 1727, but without any of the\r\noutfit, he having left the Gorbeh river November 4th, 1726. His command\r\nhad been obliged by hunger to eat the flesh of their horses and even\r\nthe rawhide harness, the skin of their fur clothing and the untanned\r\nuppers of their shoes. Their cargo was all left at four different\r\nplaces along the route, which lay through uninhabited country. The only\r\naddition to their means which they had been able to secure, was some of\r\nour own flour, to the amount of 150 puds, which on my overland journey\r\nI had been obliged to leave near Yudoma Cross on account of the death\r\nof some of my pack-horses.\r\n\r\nAlong the rivers Aldan and Maia live Yakuts of the same stock as those\r\nof the Lena and Yudoma rivers. But near and around the post of Okhotsk\r\nwander the seaside Tunguses and some Lamuts with their herds and many\r\nreindeer, who travel about winter and summer where their deer can find\r\npasturage; and some pedestrian Tunguses who live near the sea and\r\nrivers and are professional fishermen as among the Yakuts.\r\n\r\nFebruary 1, ninety men with some dogs and sledges were collected and\r\nsent under Lieut. Spanberg to bring in the outfit left behind by the\r\nYudoma river, and by the 1st of April about half of it had been\r\ntransported safely to Okhotsk. Since more remained I sent twenty-seven\r\nmen to Yudoma Cross to bring over the rest of the material on\r\npack-horses from that place, who returned in May.\r\n\r\nIn this region in winter time from Yakutsk to Okhotsk and other distant\r\nplaces people always travel on foot in parties of eight or ten, hauling\r\ntheir own sledges after them. Those belonging to our command, when sent\r\nfrom Gorbeh to Okhotsk, brought down ten or fifteen puds or more, the\r\nsnow being seven feet deep in places and travelers in winter being\r\nobliged to dig out a camp every evening, down to the ground to keep\r\nwarm.\r\n\r\nJune 30, Lieut. Spanberg in his newly built vessel sailed across the\r\nsea to the port of Bolsheretsk with a cargo of outfit and supplies and\r\nthe material for the shipbuilders and workmen of our command, sent to\r\nKamchatka to get out the timbers for a vessel, being ordered to return\r\nagain for us.\r\n\r\nJuly 3d, Lieut. Chirikoff arrived from Yakutsk with 2300 puds of flour,\r\naccording to my instructions.\r\n\r\nAugust 21, we loaded the new vessel which had returned from the land of\r\nKamchatka, and another old boat which had been at Bolsheretsk, with the\r\nflour, and the whole command then at Okhotsk proceeded across the sea\r\nto Bolsheretsk. The officer who had been left to guard the provisions\r\nwhich had not arrived from the wintering place on the Gorbeh river was\r\ndirected to float them down again and take a receipt from the\r\nauthorities at Yakutsk and endeavor, the following year, to deliver to\r\nthe command in Kamchatka some part of the provisions, iron and tar.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to take the supplies from the mouth of the [Bolshoia]\r\nriver to the post of Bolsheretsk by water in small boats. At the post\r\nwere fifteen houses inhabited by Russians. For the ascent of the\r\nshallow river small boats had been built as I desired that the outfit\r\nand the most necessary part of the provisions should be transported to\r\nthe upper Kamchatka post, a distance of 120 versts by water. The\r\ntransportation between Bolsheretsk and Upper and Lower Kamchatka in\r\nwinter was entirely carried on by the use of the native dogs. Every\r\nevening it is necessary to dig out the camp in the snow, in order to\r\nget shelter from whirlwinds of snow which in this region are called\r\n_poorga_. If one makes camp in an open place free from snow, these snow\r\nsqualls are liable to overwhelm the party and they may perish.\r\n\r\nAt Upper Kamchatka there are seventeen and at Lower Kamchatka fifty\r\nhouses, at another place [Middle Kamchatka] where there is a church are\r\nfifteen houses, and in all these settlements there are not over 150\r\nRussian subjects, who live by the collection of the _yassak_ [tribute\r\nmoney], beside those who were brought to the country on our expedition.\r\n\r\nIn coming over to Bolsheretsk we brought 300 puds of whale blubber\r\nobtained from a whale cast up by the sea, which served us as money,\r\ntogether with the Circassian tobacco which is here commonly so used.\r\n\r\nIn the southern part of Kamchatka live Kuriles, in the northern part\r\nKamchadales, whose language is peculiarly their own with but few\r\nintroduced words. Of these people some are idolaters, others believe in\r\nnothing and are strangers to all honesty. The Russians who live in\r\nKamchatka and the indigenes grow no grain and have no domestic animals\r\nexcept draught dogs. They dress and subsist upon what they can get,\r\nprincipally fish, roots and berries, in summer time wild fowl and large\r\nmarine animals. At present in the wilderness of Yakutsk, the convent,\r\nwhich is of the same age as the Kamchatka churches, cultivates barley,\r\nhemp and turnips. Here only turnips are grown by the people of the\r\nthree settlements, but they grow very large, in Russia they are\r\nsmaller, here there may be four turnips to a pud. I brought with me on\r\nmy journey some rye which was sowed around the establishments near us,\r\nbut whether it ripened or not I did not ascertain. The frost strikes\r\nearly into the ground in this region and the absence of cattle renders\r\nit difficult for the people to plow.\r\n\r\nThe natives described and from whom the yassak [tribute] is collected,\r\nbelong to the Russian Empire and are all savages. They are known for\r\ntheir dirt and bad passions. If a woman or any animal brings forth\r\ntwins then one of them is smothered, the hour it is born, and it is\r\nregarded as a great fault if one does not smother one of the two.\r\n\r\nThe Kamchadales are very superstitious. If there is any one who is very\r\nill, even a father or mother, or near the point of death, they will\r\ncarry them out into the woods and leave them without nourishment for a\r\nweek together whether it be winter or summer, from which treatment many\r\ndie. The dead are not covered with earth but are dragged out and left\r\nto be eaten by dogs. The house of a man who has died is abandoned.\r\nAmong the Kariak people it is the custom to burn the body, although\r\nthis is forbidden.\r\n\r\nBy the time of our arrival at the Lower Kamchatka post the ship-timber\r\nfor our vessel was in large part prepared, and upon the 4th of April,\r\n1728, was put upon the stocks for the vessel, which, with God's help,\r\nwas finished by the 10th of July, the timber being hauled by dogs. Tar\r\nwas made from the native tree which is called _Listvennik_ [spruce],\r\nsince the tar which we should have brought with us had not arrived.\r\n\r\nBefore this it was not known here that tar could be obtained from the\r\nnative trees. So also for the sea voyage, the deficiency of spirit made\r\nfrom grain was supplied by a liquor distilled from herbs, and salt was\r\nmade by boiling sea water. To increase our store of sea provisions, in\r\nplace of cow's butter, fat was tried out from fish, in place of meat\r\nfish was salted. The vessel was provisioned with everything needful for\r\nforty men for a year. On the 14th day of July we went out of the mouth\r\nof the Kamchatka river into the sea, in obedience to the autographic\r\norders given me by his Imperial Majesty Peter the Great, as the map\r\nconstructed for that purpose will show.\r\n\r\nAugust 8th, having arrived in north latitude 64° 30', eight men rowed\r\nto us from the shore in a skin-boat, enquiring from whence we came and\r\nwhat was our business there. They said they were Chukchi, (whom the\r\nRussians of these parts have long known) and as we lay to they were\r\nurged to come to the vessel. They inflated some floats made of sealskin\r\nand sent one man swimming to us to talk, then the boat came up to the\r\nvessel and they told us that on the coast lived many of their nation;\r\nthat the land not far from there takes a decided turn to the westward,\r\nand they also said that at no great distance from where we were, we\r\nshould see an island. This proved true, but we saw nothing valuable\r\nupon it except huts. This island in honor of the day we named St.\r\nLawrence, but we were not able to see any people upon it, though an\r\nofficer was sent in a boat from the vessel on two occasions to look for\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of August we arrived in the latitude of 67° 18' and I\r\njudged that we had clearly and fully carried out the instructions given\r\nby his Imperial Majesty of glorious and ever deserving memory, because\r\nthe land no longer extended to the north. Neither from the Chukchi\r\ncoast nor to the eastward could any extension of the land be observed.\r\nIf we should continue on our course and happen to have contrary winds\r\nwe could not get back to Kamchatka before the close of navigation and\r\nmight be obliged to winter in that region, not only without a harbor,\r\nbut where no fuel could anywhere be obtained, where the native people\r\ndo not acknowledge the authority of the Russian government, but are\r\nwholly independent and united against us in refusing to pay tribute.\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of the Kamchatka river and all the way to this place\r\nalong the seacoast wind elevated mountains, resembling a wall in\r\nsteepness, and from which the snow does not disappear in summer.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of August four canoes were observed rowing toward us,\r\ncontaining about forty people who were Chukchi of the same sort as\r\nthose whom we had met before. They brought for sale meat, fresh water,\r\nfish, fox skins, of which fifteen were of the white fox, and four\r\nwalrus teeth, which my people bought of them for needles and\r\nflint-and-steels. They said that some among them had been overland with\r\nreindeer to the Kolyma river and that they never went by sea to the\r\nKolyma; but, at a great distance, by the seashore lived some of our\r\npeople, born Russians, people whom they had known for a long time, and\r\none of them said that he had been at the Anadyr post to trade. To other\r\nquestions they gave the same answers as the Chukchi previously seen.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of September we entered the mouth of the Kamchatka river and\r\nwintered at the post of Lower Kamchatka.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of June, 1729, having repaired the vessel which had been\r\nlaid up, we went out of the mouth of the Kamchatka river and put to sea\r\nto the eastward, because the inhabitants of Kamchatka declared that on\r\nfine days land could be seen across the sea. Though none of our own\r\npeople had observed it, we went out to determine the authenticity of\r\nthe information. We sailed nearly 200 versts and saw not the slightest\r\ntrace of land. We sailed around the south point of Kamchatka to the\r\nmouth of the Bolshoia river, making a chart of this part which had not\r\npreviously been delineated. From the mouth of the Bolshoia river we\r\nsailed across the sea to the post of Okhotsk having left at Lower\r\nKamchatka and at Bolsheretsk, out of the supplies received by us from\r\nthe authorities of Yakutsk, flour, meal and dry salt meat to the amount\r\nof 800 puds.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of July the vessel reached the mouth of the Okhotsk river,\r\nwhere the outfit and supplies of the expedition were turned over to the\r\ngovernor and I, with my command, on hired horses, crossed over to\r\nYudoma Cross and thence in canoes down the Aldan river, crossing over\r\nat Belskoi and below, and carrying everything on pack horses over to\r\nYakutsk.\r\n\r\nThe whole journey occupied the time from Okhotsk, July 29th, to Yakutsk\r\non the 29th of August. We remained in Yakutsk until September 3d, and\r\nfrom September 10th until October 1st traveled in two barges on the\r\nLena when we were arrested by ice at the settlement of Peleduie. Here\r\nwe were detained until the 29th of October, by the absence of snow and\r\nthe presence of small ice in the Lena. When the ice solidified we\r\nproceeded to Ilimsk and from Ilimsk to Yeniseisk on the Tunguska river,\r\nstopping at Russian settlements; and from Yeniseisk to Tomsk with\r\nRussians and converted Tartars; from Tomsk to Chausk Ostrog, Russian\r\nsettlements; from Chausk to Tari by the Barabinskoi steppe; from Tari\r\nto Tobolsk by the Irtish river among the Tartars; arriving at Tobolsk\r\nJanuary 10, 1730. From Tobolsk for St. Petersburg we left on the 25th\r\nof the same month, following the same route by which we originally\r\nreached Tobolsk from the capital. We arrived in St. Petersburg March 1,\r\n1730.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Note._--The extensive tabular itinerary covering two quarto pages,\r\nshowing the details of the route traversed in going to Kamchatka, the\r\ndistances and directions from point to point (except during the sea\r\nvoyages), the native tribes in the region traversed, etc.--is not\r\nreproduced, as it contains no information of importance in the present\r\nconnection. The other table, showing the astronomical position\r\nestimated for the more important places is herewith transcribed.\r\n\r\nTo get the approximate Greenwich longitude 67° should be added to the\r\nlongitudes in the table which are reckoned from Tobolsk.\r\n\r\nI have provided a tabular itinerary, which shows the dates of the\r\nevents of the expedition, derived from Bering's Report and from other\r\nsources, which are indicated by letters. B stands for Brookes' edition\r\nof Du Halde; H for Campbell's version in Harris; M for Müller's\r\naccount; and L for Lauridsen. The astronomical events are taken from\r\nOppolzer's standard catalogue of solar and lunar eclipses.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted in the following tables there are a few discrepancies\r\nof single days compared with Lauridsen's account or other authorities.\r\nThese I take to be due to the use in the ship's journal of the nautical\r\nday in which the nautical second day of the month begins on the first\r\ncalendar day at noon and ends at noon on the second calendar day, so\r\nthat events occurring during the first twelve hours of the nautical day\r\nwould have a date one day later than the true calendar date.\r\n\r\n_Catalogue of the towns and notable Siberian places put on the chart\r\nthrough which the route passes, with their latitude and longitude, the\r\nlatter computed from Tobolsk._\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------+-------------+------------\r\n    Cities and Places.                  | Latitude N. | Long.

It is probably from this table that Dr.\r\nCampbell derived his list, in Harris, which is, barring some additions,\r\nerrors, and mistranslations, much the same. As Bering does not give any\r\nlongitude for Lower Kamchatka post it is highly improbable that he\r\nobserved it at that place, by means of a lunar eclipse or otherwise.\r\n\r\nChirikoff's observation of a lunar eclipse at Ilimsk made that point\r\n30° 13' east longitude from Tobolsk or, approximately, 97° 13' east\r\nfrom Greenwich. His pedometric observations placed Ilimsk in 103° 44'\r\nE. Gr. On recent charts Ilimsk is in about 104° E. Gr., so that the\r\neclipse observation was in error about 6½ degrees. The meridian used on\r\nthe voyage of 1728 was that of Lower Kamchatka, based on pedometric\r\nobservations from Ilimsk computed by means of a traverse table. These,\r\naccording to Chirikoff's journal, gave for the Lower Kamchatka post a\r\nmeridian of 126° 01' 49\" east from St. Petersburg or about 156° 02'\r\neast from Greenwich, which is in error about six and a quarter degrees.\r\nDiscarding the eclipse observation and using only the pedometric\r\nobservations from Tobolsk to Lower Kamchatka the result for that place\r\nis 162° 33' E. Gr., which is very near the truth. I have no doubt that\r\nthis result is what was finally used in the chart (though not in the\r\noriginal report) and, therefore, that all the observations of Lauridsen\r\nand others in regard to the alleged eclipse in Kamchatka are based on a\r\nmisunderstanding and without value.\r\n\r\nITINERARY FOR BERING'S FIRST EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n_Dates corrected to ordinary calendar, beginning at midnight._\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------+-------------+------------+-----------\r\n                                |             |   Date.    |   Date.\r\n                                | Authorities.| Old Style. | New Style.\r\n  ------------------------------+-------------+------------+-----------\r\n          1725.                 |             |            |\r\n  Advance party under Chirikoff |             |            |\r\n    left St. Petersburg         | H.

The vessel, which was named the _Gabriel_, was\r\nlaunched at the Lower Kamchatka fort and loaded with a year's supply of\r\nprovisions for forty men (B. C. H. M.). She resembled the packet boats\r\nused in the Baltic.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes._--This vessel was constructed of the Kamchatkan spruce, a\r\nspecies according to Kittlitz closely resembling _Abies canadensis_ of\r\nAmerica. There is also a smaller species, _A. mertensiana_, and by\r\ndistillation of these two trees the deficiency in their supply of tar\r\nor pitch was made up. The rigging, sail-cloth, oakum and anchors had\r\nbeen transferred with great labor from Tobolsk. The planking and\r\ntimbers were doubtless fastened with trenails and not with spikes, so\r\nthe amount of iron used was much smaller than it would be in most\r\nmodern vessels. The provisioning of the expedition is the subject of a\r\nfanciful paragraph garbled from Bering's original report, which has\r\nbeen quoted by every one of the historians of the voyage from D'Anville\r\nto Lauridsen. I transcribe it from Brooke's translation of 1736, pp.\r\n437-8.\r\n\r\n\"The provisions consisted of Carrots for want of Corn (=grain or\r\nwheat), the fat of Fish uncured served instead of Butter and salt fish\r\nsupplied the place of all other meats.\"\r\n\r\nCampbell in Harris' Voyages, p. 1020, still further enlarges this\r\nstatement and Lauridsen puts it\r\n\r\n\"Fish oil was his butter and dried fish his beef and pork. Salt he was\r\nobliged to get from the sea,\" and \"he distilled spirits from 'sweet\r\nstraw.'\"\r\n\r\nThis gives a totally false idea of the supplies provided for the\r\nexpedition. Bering received from Yakutsk over forty-two tons of flour,\r\nand large numbers, fifty at a time, of the small Siberian cattle were\r\ndriven on the hoof to Okhotsk where their flesh was partly dried and\r\npartly salted. On his return he delivered surplus supplies to the\r\nproper officers in Kamchatka and at Okhotsk ever 30,000 lbs. of meal,\r\nflour and salt meat. There were at that time no carrots to be had in\r\nKamchatka as Bering himself testifies. Salted salmon then as now,\r\nformed a staple article of diet in Kamchatka and was without doubt\r\nincluded in his stores. The delicate fat obtained by boiling the\r\nbellies of the salmon, is annually prepared in Kamchatka and is\r\nregarded to this day as a great delicacy (cf. Voyage of the _Marchesa_,\r\n2d edition, p. 135.) A store of it might without any hardship be\r\nfurnished to the commander for use as butter. Salt he obtained as it is\r\nusually obtained by evaporating sea-water, and the absence of strong\r\ndrink of European origin was supplied by a distillation of the stalks\r\nof the bear's foot or \"sweet herb\" of the Cossacks (_Heracleum dulce_\r\nKittlitz), long used for that purpose by the Russians in Siberia and\r\nfrom which, even in modern times, according to Seemann, the Kamchadales\r\nsecured additions to their scanty supply of syrup or sugar.\r\n\r\nThe supplies then of the expedition, were not inferior to those in\r\ncommon use at sea at that period, and as far as health is concerned\r\nwere certainly less likely to result in an invasion of scurvy than the\r\nuse of salt beef and pork alone would have been.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the fare on naval vessels all over the world\r\nin those days, was rude and coarse to a degree now long unknown and\r\nthat it was not until the voyages of Cook, nearly half a century later,\r\nthat the antiscorbutic and varied regimen, now usually enforced by law\r\nin maritime nations, was even thought of.\r\n\r\nThe force crowded together on the little _Gabriel_ is enumerated by\r\nLauridsen presumably from the account of Bergh.\r\n\r\nIt consisted beside the commander, of Lieutenants Martin Spanberg and\r\nAlexie Chirikoff; Second Lieutenant Peter Chaplin, Doctor Nieman, a\r\nquartermaster, eight sailors, a worker in leather, a rope maker, five\r\ncarpenters, a boatswain, two cossacks with a drummer and nine marines,\r\nsix servants, stewards, etc., and two Kariak interpreters, a cabin boy\r\nand a pilot, in all forty-four persons.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear from Lauridsen's account whether in the above list are\r\nor are not included the two mates, Richard Engel and George Morison, or\r\nthe cartographer Potiloff, who started with Bering from St. Petersburg.\r\nLuzhin was left behind, being ill.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 13/24. The variation of the compass was determined to be 13° 10'\r\neasterly (L.). In the afternoon (being the 14th nautical reckoning) the\r\nvessel left the Kamchatka river. (B. C. H.) They steered to the\r\nnortheast along the coast, which was kept in sight to the north and\r\nwest, in from nine to twelve fathoms water. As the point of departure\r\nCape Kamchatka was determined to be in north latitude 56° 3' (M. L.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes._--The variation of the compass in 1885 was 2° 30' easterly\r\n(Schott). As will be seen by the Table of Positions, the latitude above\r\ngiven for the cape is not the same as that adopted by Bering on his\r\nchart. The depth mentioned shows that the _Gabriel_ must have kept\r\nwithin a few miles, probably not exceeding ten, from the shore and the\r\nvery slow progress made, as indicated by the log, not much exceeding\r\ntwo miles an hour gives rise to the suspicion that, in the early part\r\nof the voyage, in order to keep their survey continuous, they probably\r\nlay to during the hours of darkness. Off Karaginski Island the\r\nvariation of the compass was determined to be the same as at the mouth\r\nof the Kamchatka river.\r\n\r\nFrom this date to the 27th, the accessible authorities give no data,\r\nand the expedition probably pursued its way uneventfully.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 27/Aug. 7. This day a prominent Cape was passed at a distance of\r\nsome three miles. [It was named St. Thaddeus, after the saint on whose\r\nholy day it was again seen on the return voyage.] Many grampus,\r\nporpoises, seals and sealions were seen (L.).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes._--This Cape St. Thaddeus is not the cape of the same name on\r\nmodern charts, but the cape now known as Cape Navarin. This is evident\r\nfrom Bering's chart. Bering's position for the cape is in error about\r\nfifteen miles in latitude and three degrees in longitude on his chart,\r\nwhile in the list of positions, the error is only about five miles of\r\nlatitude and half a degree in longitude.\r\n\r\nFrom near Cape Thaddeus Bering stood across Anadyr Gulf, out of sight\r\nof the low land, missing Anadyr Bay, and thereby falling into the error\r\nof placing on his chart the mouth of the Anadyr River south of the\r\ncape. The error was subsequently corrected by G. F. Müller.\r\n\r\nLauridsen observes (American edition, p. 30), that \"having sailed past\r\nthe Anadyr River without quite being able to find their bearings, in\r\nregions of which they had not a single astronomical determination,\"\r\netc. This is absurd. They had a compass and there is no reason why they\r\nshould not find their bearings, and it is certain they were there to\r\nmake observations and not to verify those already made. No apology is\r\nneeded for Bering's determination to press more rapidly northward. It\r\nwas in accordance with common sense, considering the lateness of the\r\nseason and the uncertainty of what they had to accomplish before the\r\nseason closed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAug. 1/12. Festival of the Holy Cross. The expedition saw land to the\r\nnorthward and soon after entered a great bay which they named Holy\r\nCross Bay. This they explored to the river at its head which they named\r\nBolshoia (Great) River, and on the western point of entrance the\r\nlatitude was, Aug. 2/13, observed to be 65° 35' north, while the\r\nlongitude by dead reckoning was estimated at 182° 15' east of\r\nGreenwich, and the magnetic variation ¾ of a point easterly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes._--Lauridsen says (p. 31, American edition) that in Holy Cross\r\nBay the _Gabriel_ spent two days under sail in search of fresh water\r\nand a place to anchor. This is extremely singular, as there is an\r\nanchorage immediately at the entrance to the bay, on the starboard\r\nhand, and runs of fresh water are abundant. The application of an\r\nobvious correction[10] to the list of positions given by Campbell makes\r\nthe position at the western elbow or spit, at the mouth of Holy Cross\r\nBay, that which is given above. This position is over a degree too far\r\nwest and over six miles too far south. But Lauridsen (quoting Campbell\r\nwithout observing the blunder?) not stating the source of his\r\ninformation, gives a position (N. Lat. 62° 50') which is two hundred\r\nand twelve miles too far south and the English translation improves\r\nupon this by making it 60° 50', or three hundred and thirty-two miles\r\nsouth of the truth, or two hundred and sixty-five miles south of the\r\nentrance to the bay as platted on Bering's own chart.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: In Harris' Voy., 2d ed., ii, p. 1021, Bering's table of\r\npositions is printed:\r\n\r\n                                           (N.

It is\r\nsomewhat surprising that in using this table nobody seems to have\r\nrecognized these errors.]\r\n\r\nBering's table in his report and Bering's chart as printed by D'Anville\r\ndiffer from each other fifteen miles in latitude and two degrees and\r\ntwenty-five minutes or nearly seventy-five miles in longitude. The\r\nchart is the more correct, but it differs more than thirty miles in\r\nlatitude and nearly a degree in longitude from the modern observations\r\nof Lütké and Rodgers for the same locality. After leaving Holy Cross\r\nBay, the voyage was continued to the southeast along the \"high and\r\nrocky coast\" of which Lauridsen (probably paraphrasing Bergh) says that\r\n\"every indentation was very carefully explored.\" This is obviously a\r\nflight of fancy, since a good part of this coast is low and sandy,\r\nwhile there is no indication of two excellent harbors which it affords,\r\non any of the charts of Bering or his successors in that century.\r\n\r\n\r\nAug. 6/17, 1728. This day, the festival of the Transfiguration, found\r\nthe _Gabriel_ entering a small bay, which on that account was named\r\nTransfiguration (Preobrazhenia) Bay. Here they anchored (L.).\r\nLieutenant Chaplin was sent ashore for water and found native huts but\r\nno people.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes._--This bay has never been surveyed, and on the best modern\r\ncharts is merely indicated, while on many others it is omitted\r\naltogether or the name transferred to the anchorage north of Cape\r\nBering or to Plover Bay. Bering's position for the spit at the entrance\r\nof Transfiguration Bay is two degrees and a quarter too far east and\r\nsixteen miles too far north by the table, but his chart gives the\r\nposition much more closely, with a difference from Rodgers' chart of\r\nnot exceeding five miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nAug. 7/18. They proceeded along the coast in a south-southeasterly\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note._--The total eclipse of the moon of this date could hardly have\r\nbeen observed by Bering, since the moon must have been close to the\r\nhorizon and first contact of the shadow occurred only about five\r\nminutes before the moon set. As Bering does not mention it, it is not\r\nlikely that he noted the eclipse.\r\n\r\n\r\nAug. 8/19. At seven in the morning a skin-boat (umiak or bidarrá) was\r\nobserved to be launched from the shore, eight men getting into it and\r\nrowing toward the vessel (B.). They approached within hail, and were\r\nunderstood, through the aid of the Kariak interpreters on board the\r\n_Gabriel_, to enquire whence the vessel came and what was the object of\r\nthe expedition in entering these waters. After much persuasion one of\r\nthe natives left the skin-boat and swam, sustaining himself on two\r\ninflated seal-skins tied by a pole, to the _Gabriel_ and came on board\r\nand the others, seeing that no harm befel him, came nearer the vessel\r\nshortly afterward (M. B. C.). The interpreters had some difficulty in\r\nunderstanding all the natives said, but it was gathered from their\r\nconversation that these people called themselves Chukchi (or by an\r\nanalogous name); that they were acquainted with the Russians, by report\r\nor otherwise, that there were numerous settlements of their people\r\nalong this shore; that the Anadyr River lay far to the west (L.); that\r\nto the south and east lay an island which would soon be visible to the\r\npeople on the _Gabriel_ if they continued on the course they were then\r\nsteering; that in the vicinity of this island the shore of the mainland\r\nchanges its direction and extends beyond to the north and then to the\r\nwestward (B. M. C. H.). The man who had boarded the vessel was given\r\nsome presents and sent back to the native boat, in the hope that he\r\nwould persuade his comrades to come on board the _Gabriel_, but,\r\nsuspecting some evil design, the natives pulled away toward the shore\r\nand disappeared. According to Bergh, Chaplin's journal expresses regret\r\nthat more important information could not be obtained owing to the\r\ndifficulty in interpreting what was said by the Chukchi. At noon the\r\nlatitude was estimated to be 64° 30'. In the afternoon the cape\r\nmentioned by the Chukchis was seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes._--The account given in Bering's report, and variously rendered\r\nby Müller, Brooks, D'Anville and Campbell, differs in several details\r\nfrom that given in Chaplin's journal and described by Bergh and\r\nLauridsen. The various English versions of both fail in clearly\r\nrendering the important point gained by this interview with the\r\nnatives, which was, that, at a short distance, the main coast changes\r\nits direction and turns to the north and west. These Chukchis pointed\r\nthe way to the strait for the party on the _Gabriel_, and their account\r\nproved to be accurate in every particular.\r\n\r\nThe people of this part of the coast call themselves _Tsau-chú_, which\r\nis their tribal name. The similar name of another branch living near\r\nthe Anadyr River has been corrupted into the word Chuk-chi, by the\r\nRussians, from which we derive our general name for these people.\r\nLauridsen says \"Breden var 64° 41'\" which in the American edition\r\nstands, \"the longitude (sic) was 64° 41'.\" But the original and all the\r\nvariants of Bering's own report make the latitude 64° 30' which is\r\ncorrect. If it had been 64° 41' they would have been north of their own\r\nposition for Transfiguration Bay, from which their course had been\r\nS.S.E., therefore the 41' is certainly erroneous.\r\n\r\nOn Bering's chart he refers to the point of the coast where the shore\r\nchanges its direction under the name _Chukotskago Noss_, which means\r\nthe promontory of the Chukchi, though this is not the same as the\r\nChukchi Cape of the Anadyr Cossacks, who so denominated the eastern\r\nextreme of Asia, which they knew from report and by the voyage of\r\nDeshneff. There can be no reasonable doubt that Bering named his cape\r\nafter the people who had described it to him, although the\r\nimperfections of the record leave this to be inferred. Bering's map\r\ngives the latitude of the south extreme of the cape as about 64° 02',\r\nand it is erroneously represented as extending south of the latitude of\r\nthe northwest end of St. Lawrence Island. Its real latitude is about\r\nfifteen miles further north. Cook made it 64° 13'. Chaplin's journal\r\n(according to Lauridsen) makes it 64° 18', which would agree with the\r\nlatest surveys very nearly, though the coincidence must be regarded as\r\na happy accident in view of their imperfect tables, instruments and\r\nmethods. Bering's report places its eastern extreme in 64° 25' and\r\n(wrongly) in the same longitude as the west end of St. Lawrence Island.\r\n\r\n\r\nAug. 10/21. St. Lawrence's day. The island referred to by the Chukchi\r\nwas seen and the vessel stood toward it, about two o'clock in the\r\nafternoon. Twice, an officer with a four-oared boat was sent to\r\nreconnoiter the coast more closely, but he saw only what appeared to be\r\nhuts without inhabitants (C). The island (of which only the northwest\r\nhilly portion was seen, owing to the hazy weather) was named after the\r\npatron saint of the day and the course of the vessel was changed to the\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nAug. 11/22. At noon the latitude was estimated at 64° 20', and at\r\nsunset an attempt was made by the determination of the magnetic\r\nvariation to get the longitude (L.).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes._--An illustration of the want of care with which Lauridsen has\r\nweighed his comments, it may be pointed out that he claims (p. 32, Am.\r\nEd.) that on reaching latitude 64° 20' the _Gabriel_ was in Bering\r\nStrait, while two pages later, on her return southward, he declares her\r\nto have got out of the strait on reaching latitude 64° 27'! As a matter\r\nof fact, at the present day, the whalers and traders of this region\r\nconsider that Cape Chaplin (more commonly known as Indian Point) forms\r\nthe southwest point of entrance to the strait; and this point is\r\nsituated in latitude 64° 25' and E. longitude 187° 40', as determined\r\nby the writer in 1880. This is perhaps the point referred to by Bering\r\nas the eastern point of his Chukotskoi Cape.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic method of determining the longitude would give correct\r\nresults only accidentally, as previously explained. The result\r\nannounced by Lauridsen for the present occasion is 25° 31' east from\r\nLower Kamchatka Ostrog or 187° 51' east from Greenwich, which would be\r\nwithin a few miles of the latest determinations. But it is obvious from\r\nBering's map that he could not have made his position less than 28° 45'\r\neast from Lower Kamchatka, and the position above given is perhaps an\r\ninterpolation from modern sources, which has been misunderstood or\r\nmistranslated. As Lauridsen has paraphrased, not quoted, it is\r\nimpossible in the absence of Bergh's original to determine who is\r\nresponsible for the incongruity. An interpolation seems the more likely\r\nsince Bering himself gives the longitude as 189° 55' E. Gr.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: A glance at Bergh shows that this statement of Lauridsen\r\nis simply a blunder. Bergh only says they obtained the magnetic\r\nvariation (25° 31' easterly) by an _amplitude_ observation! Longitude\r\nis not mentioned, nor Kamchatka.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAug. 12/23. From noon of the 11th to noon of this day, the _Gabriel_\r\nsailed sixty-nine miles, but the difference of latitude was only 21\r\nmiles. The wind was light to fresh and the weather overcast (L.).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes._--If the above statement be taken literally with the assumption\r\nthat they were at noon of the 11th in latitude 64° 20' and E. longitude\r\n188° from Greenwich, it would give their position for noon of the 12th\r\nas 64° 49' and longitude 190° 45' E. Gr., which does not at all accord\r\nwith the subsequently narrated course, etc. If we proceed on the\r\nhypothesis that it means that the log recorded 69 miles and that only\r\n29 miles were made good (which might easily happen if the polar current\r\nwere running strong on the west side of the strait) and that their\r\ncourse was parallel with the Siberian shore in a general way they would\r\nhave been, at noon of August 12th, in latitude 64° 49' and longitude\r\n188° E. Gr. or thereabouts, which agrees very fairly with the known\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nAug. 13/24. A fresh breeze and cloudy weather. The _Gabriel_ sailed the\r\nwhole day with no land in sight and the difference in latitude was only\r\n78 miles at noon, reckoned from noon of the 12th. The wind diminished\r\ntoward night.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes._--On the same hypothesis as to the meaning of \"difference in\r\nlatitude\" as the words are used by Lauridsen, the _Gabriel_ at noon of\r\nthe 13th would have been ten or twelve miles south from East Cape and\r\nin about latitude 65° 55'. If the words are to be taken literally, as a\r\nnavigator would use them, the _Gabriel_ would have been about fifteen\r\nmiles to the northward and eastward of East Cape, which agrees much\r\nless with the subsequently detailed circumstances. With the nautical\r\nday beginning at noon on the 13th according to Lauridsen the weather\r\nbegan to be calm and cloudy which would check their progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nAug. 14/25. This is the festival of Saint Demetrius of Africa. A\r\ncurrent was experienced during this day which was estimated to have\r\nhelped the vessel northward eight miles and three quarters. This\r\ncurrent ran from south-southeast to north-northwest. From noon of the\r\n13th to noon of this day the vessel sailed 29 miles in addition to the\r\ncurrent drift. At noon the latitude was estimated to be 66° 41' and\r\nhigh land was visible astern. At three o'clock in the afternoon high\r\nmountains were observed to the southward, which, says Chaplin, \"were\r\nprobably on the continent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes._--Under any hypothesis either the run of the vessel was\r\nunderestimated or the latitude was overestimated. Adding the estimated\r\nrun to the position attained under our hypothesis for the 12th and 13th\r\nit will put the _Gabriel_ at noon, August 14th, in about north latitude\r\n66° 24' and longitude E. Gr. 191° 30'. Chaplin's reckoning as given by\r\nLauridsen would have put the _Gabriel_ more than fifty miles off shore\r\nwhen the land spoken of would have been out of sight. Our hypothesis\r\nputs her about twenty-eight miles N.E. true from East Cape when the\r\nhigh land of either shore, under favorable circumstances, might have\r\nbeen seen even if the sky were overcast. Clouds do not interfere with\r\nseeing, unless attended by fog or haze. During this day the _Gabriel_\r\nhad sailed between East Cape and the islands now known as the Diomedes;\r\nthe shore being near by. Why then should it be noted in the log that\r\n\"high land was seen astern\" at noon? The high land of Siberia they had\r\nseen and sailed along for days in full sight of it. It seems to us that\r\nthis excludes the idea that the log refers to the Siberian highland and\r\nthat what was seen was the loom of land not before seen, as of the\r\nDiomedes or even of America. It may not have been clear to the\r\ncommander and yet have been marked enough for the subordinate officer\r\nto have put it in his log, with the dead reckoning and daily notes.[12]\r\nOn several old charts mention is made of land seen by Spanberg which is\r\nsupposed to have been America, after Gwosdeff had confirmed the\r\nexistence of the American mainland in that direction and Synd had\r\nlanded upon it. This suggestion is not unimportant in connection with\r\nthe subsequent conduct of Bering and will be referred to again in its\r\nproper connection. The further fact that all early printed versions of\r\nBering's list of positions, refer to the modern Diomedes only as the\r\nisland of _St. Demetrius_ and that this day was the festival of that\r\nobscure saint, lends further confirmation to the above suggestions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Lauridsen gets over the discrepancy by putting the word\r\n\"still\" before \"seen\" (Am. Ed., p. 41), but there is nothing in the\r\noriginal sources to confirm this view of the matter.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAug. 15/26. The _Gabriel_ appears to have continued to sail in a\r\nnortheasterly direction until three o'clock in the afternoon, having\r\nbeen aided by the current to the extent of 8¾ miles and sailed 65\r\nmiles; many whales were seen and the depth averaged between 23 and 36\r\nfathoms. Since the 13th the water had appeared whitish or discolored.\r\nThe wind was moderate and the weather cloudy. Between noon and three\r\no'clock the vessel made seven miles against a head wind. The position\r\nof the _Gabriel_ at that time was estimated to be in north latitude 67°\r\n18' and 30° 17' east longitude from the town of Lower Kamchatka (C.\r\ncorrected).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note._--The nautical day Aug. 15 extending from noon of the 14th to\r\nnoon of the 15th is altogether omitted from the American translation of\r\nLauridsen's book. The position for the turning point estimated by\r\nChaplin is manifestly by dead reckoning, as the sky was cloudy. It was\r\nnot adopted in the list of positions published by Campbell in Harris'\r\nVoyages nor on Bering's map. In the former the longitude he adopts is\r\n27° 37' east of Lower Kamchatka fort, and this agrees exactly with the\r\npoint on the coast in Du Halde's engraving of Bering's map where the\r\nmountains cease to be put down near the shore, the point on the north\r\ncoast of Siberia where Lauridsen, and Chaplin as quoted by him, say\r\nBering did not go, and the point which has been generally regarded as\r\nBering's farthest!\r\n\r\nIf we apply the distance and direction from Chaplin's journal to the\r\ncourse of the _Gabriel_ platted from his preceding data, literally, it\r\nwill put the turning point of the voyage in N. latitude 67° 32' and E.\r\nlongitude 193° 37' or thereabouts, which is about thirty-five miles off\r\nthe American coast southwest from Cape Seppings. But if we do this the\r\nposition is far from agreeing with Chaplin's. By applying the\r\nhypothetical correction which we have heretofore used, the position\r\nwould be in latitude 67° 24' and E. longitude 193° 15' from Greenwich\r\nor 31° east from Lower Kamchatka fort, agreeing more nearly with\r\nChaplin. On the other hand the position off Cape Seppings agrees better\r\nwith Chaplin's figures for the remainder of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point the commander of the expedition determined to turn\r\nhomeward. The _Gabriel_ was put on a course S. by E. by compass (S. by\r\nW. ½ W. true, the variation allowed being 2½ points easterly) before a\r\nbrisk seven knot breeze, making better time than is recorded for any\r\npart of her outward voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes._--Lauridsen says[13] that, in terminating the outward voyage,\r\nBering \"announced that as he had now accomplished his task it was his\r\nduty, according to his orders, to return.\" Müller and other authorities\r\nquote, more or less modified in the translation, the reasons given in\r\nBering's report. But, as there is no reason to suppose these were\r\nuttered to the ship's company officially at the time, a consideration\r\nof them may be deferred until the total results of the voyage are\r\ndiscussed. The course set, according to Chaplin's journal, would, if\r\nmade good, have carried the _Gabriel_ east of the Diomedes and close to\r\nCape Prince of Wales. The northwesterly current referred to by Chaplin\r\nand recognized by most navigators who have since visited those seas,\r\nwould have carried the vessel more to the westward, as was actually the\r\nresult, and it was probably allowed for.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Bergh (p. 54) quotes Chaplin's journal, which says: \"At\r\nthree o'clock Captain Bering announced: _that it was necessary for him,\r\nin spite of his instructions, to turn back_, and put the vessel about\r\nwith orders to steer S. by E. by compass.\" The italics are Bergh's, who\r\nadds that, in the journal of Lieut. Chirikoff, the same statement is\r\nmade in the same words. I transliterate the italicized phrases\r\naccording to the schedule for Russian letters published in _Nature_,\r\nFeb. 27, 1890. \"Chto nadlezhit emu protiv ukazu vo ispolnenie\r\nvozvratit'sya.\" This plain statement, which proves that (at the moment)\r\nBering recognized that he was not fulfilling his orders, is suppressed\r\nby Lauridsen and of course by Bering himself when he came to prepare\r\nhis official report. Lauridsen however is not satisfied with\r\nsuppressing the truth, which would have weighed so heavily against his\r\nhero and his argument, but, with the truth in his possession, he has\r\ninserted in his book a statement which is diametrically opposed to it\r\nas above cited.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 16/27. Saint Diomede's day. The _Gabriel_ had kept on her course\r\nwith a free wind making more than seven knots (miles) an hour. At nine\r\nin the morning they found themselves off a high promontory on the west,\r\nwhere there were Chukchi habitations. On the east and seaward they saw\r\nan island, which it was proposed to call after the saint of the day. At\r\nnoon the vessel had made since the previous noon 115 miles and had\r\nreached latitude 66° 02'. Continuing on their way, with a fresh breeze\r\nand cloudy weather, they sailed along the Asiatic coast near enough to\r\nobserve many natives and at two places they saw dwellings. At three\r\nP.M. very high land and mountains were passed (probably the highlands\r\nnear St. Lawrence Bay).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes._--From 3 P.M. Aug. 15th to 9 A.M. Aug. 16th is 18 hours, which\r\nat seven knots an hour (allowing the alleged excess to be the\r\nequivalent of the drift caused by the current) would amount to 126\r\nmiles. Deduct from this the seven miles sailed between noon and 3 P.M.\r\nAug. 15th in the opposite direction and we have remaining 119 miles\r\nmade on the homeward voyage at a time when the _Gabriel_ was between\r\nthe Diomedes and East Cape, or at least in plain sight of both. But\r\nthree hours later, at noon, according to Lauridsen, they had made only\r\n115 miles in all, although the breeze was fresh and fair. From\r\nChaplin's position for the turning point to latitude 66° 02' off East\r\nCape is 96 miles. From our hypothetically corrected position for the\r\nturning point, off Cape Seppings, the distance would be to the same\r\nplace 126 miles, or thereabouts. It is evident that there is a\r\nmiscalculation, or an error in the record here, which, without further\r\ndata, it is not possible to correct.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that Bering with whom the right of naming any new island\r\nwould have rested, did not then name the island above mentioned after\r\nSt Diomede. On all copies of the earlier version of his chart it\r\nappears if at all under the name of the Island of St. Demetrius. From\r\nthis we may suspect that he identified it with the high land seen Aug.\r\n14th, St. Demetrius' day, while others on board, suspecting they were\r\nnot the same proposed the name of Diomede for the present island;\r\nregarding the high land as something distinct. If the hardy and\r\nself-willed Spanberg was the one who reported the land Aug. 14th, and\r\nif he saw the high land about Cape Prince of Wales, as several old\r\ncharts allege, he would have been the last to admit that the relatively\r\nsmall and adjacent island now seen, should be identified with his\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nAug. 17/28. The breeze having been strong and fair an observation at\r\nnoon indicated that the latitude was 64° 27' and that the _Gabriel_ had\r\nsailed 164 miles since noon of the 16th. In the afternoon the weather\r\nwas clear and the wind became light. (The _Gabriel_ must have come out\r\nof the strait this afternoon).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes._--A distance of 164 miles from the position of the previous\r\nnoon would have put the _Gabriel_ in latitude 63° 38'. The distance on\r\nthe general course sailed by the _Gabriel_ from 66° 02' to 64° 27' is\r\nabout 107 miles. It is possible that in copying or printing 104 miles\r\nhas become transmuted to 164 miles. There is an obvious error here of\r\nsome kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nAug. 18/29. (Lauridsen does not refer to any record for this day, but\r\nit is probable that the wind continued light and the weather fair and\r\nthat the _Gabriel_ was slowly working her way westward and southward in\r\nthe vicinity of Cape Chukotski.)\r\n\r\nAug. 19/30. In the afternoon being in the vicinity of the place where\r\nthey had met the Chukchi boat on the outward voyage, four baidars were\r\nseen with their crews pulling for the vessel, which accordingly lay by\r\nfor them to come up with her. There were ten natives to each baidar, or\r\nforty in all. They brought reindeer meat, fish, and fresh water in\r\nlarge bladders for sale for which they were suitably rewarded, while\r\nthe crew of the _Gabriel_ obtained from them skins of the red and the\r\npolar foxes and four walrus teeth, which the natives bartered for\r\nneedles, flint-and-steel for striking fire, and iron. These Chukchi\r\ntold them that they went over land to trade at the Kolyma River,\r\ncarrying their goods with reindeer, and that they never went by sea.\r\nThey had long known the Russians and one of them had even been to the\r\nAnadyrsk fort to trade. From this man they had hopes of gaining\r\nvaluable information but he could tell them nothing more than they had\r\nlearned from the first Chukchis who had been questioned.\r\n\r\nAug. 20/31 to Aug. 29/Sept. 9. (For this period the documents\r\naccessible to me give no information, but the _Gabriel_ was doubtless\r\npursuing her homeward way uneventfully along the coast of Kamchatka.)\r\n\r\nAug. 30/Sept. 10. A heavy storm arose with fog and the _Gabriel_\r\nfinding herself dangerously close to the shore anchored near the land\r\nto ride it out. A note in Harris indicates that they may have been near\r\nKaraginski Island.\r\n\r\nAug. 31/Sept. 11. At one P.M. the storm had abated, but in weighing\r\nanchor the cable had been so chafed by the rocky bottom that it parted\r\nand they lost the anchor, and were obliged to put to sea without\r\nrecovering it.\r\n\r\nSept. 1/12, 1728. At five o'clock in the afternoon they approached and\r\nat seven the next morning entered the mouth of the Kamchatka river,\r\nthus ending the voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note._--The _Gabriel_ was secured in a slough of the river and the\r\nparty went up the river to the fort of Lower Kamchatka where Bering\r\npassed the winter.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the residents of Kamchatka and others more or less\r\nfamiliar with the reports of Cossack explorations in Chukchi-land were\r\nnot altogether satisfied with the summary manner in which exploration\r\nhad been given up by Bering, and his apparent assumption that there was\r\nno adjacent land to the eastward except small islands. More or less\r\nsuch discussion and criticism could hardly have failed to reach his\r\nears, and his reflections may have led him to think that, after all, he\r\nhad been too hasty. Trees not indigenous to Kamchatka had been seen\r\nfloating near the shores, no heavy breakers ever proceeded from the\r\neastward and it was even alleged that land or the loom of land might be\r\nseen to the east from the coast mountains in very clear weather. On\r\naccount of these and other reasons[14] which were urged by residents of\r\nthe country, Bering determined to make a new trial. Instead of\r\nproceeding directly to Okhotsk across Kamchatka he fitted out the\r\n_Gabriel_ for another voyage. Beside the fact that Luzhin, one of his\r\ncartographers, had explored the Kurile Islands lying next to Kamchatka,\r\nthe vessel _Fortuna_ during Bering's absence had doubled Cape Lopatka\r\nand was anchored in the Kamchatka River when Bering entered it on his\r\nreturn. It was therefore evident that the straits were navigable and\r\nthe return voyage might be made that way. Spanberg was ordered to\r\nBolsheretsk \"on account of illness\" (L.), and it is possible he took\r\nthe _Fortuna_ back there since she had already returned to Bolsheretsk\r\nwhen Bering reached that port, on his way to Okhotsk.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: The natives even claimed that a man had been stranded on\r\nthe coast of Kamchatka in 1715, who stated that his own country lay to\r\nthe eastward and contained forests with high trees and large rivers.\r\n(Lauridsen, op. cit. Am. ed. p. 51). Bering himself states that he made\r\nthe search of 1729 at the instance of the Kamchatkan residents.]\r\n\r\nLauridsen has ascribed to Bering's own initiative the willingness to\r\nmake another search for land as if these ideas were original with him.\r\nIt is evident that this is unjustified and fanciful. Müller's account\r\nshows that the incitement to a second attempt proceeded from the\r\nresidents of the country and that Bering complied with their\r\nsuggestions; and Bering says so himself in his report.\r\n\r\nOn June[15] 5/16, 1729, the _Gabriel_ left the mouth of the Kamchatka\r\nRiver and stood to the eastward, directly off shore. She continued on\r\nthis course about forty-eight hours, sailing a distance variously\r\nestimated at from ninety to one hundred and thirty miles. The weather\r\nwas foggy, no land was seen, the wind shifted to dead ahead at east\r\nnortheast, and on the third day Bering gave up the search and steered\r\nfor the southern coast of Kamchatka, the extreme of which is marked by\r\nthe point known as Narrow (Ooskoi) Cape, or more generally as Shovel\r\n(Lopatka) Cape, from its low square termination. He determined the\r\nlatitude of this cape, and passing through the strait south of it\r\nreached Bolsheretsk on the west coast of the peninsula on the second of\r\nJuly. Most of this time was probably spent in tracing the form of the\r\nsouthern part of Kamchatka. Half way between the Kamchatka River and\r\nthe coast the variation was observed to be one point easterly, and off\r\nAvatcha Bay three-quarters of a point easterly.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Lauridsen says July, which is erroneous.]\r\n\r\nIn the American translation of Lauridsen it is said (p. 51) that Bering\r\nfixed the difference of latitude (for which one should read longitude)\r\nbetween Bolsheretsk and Lower Kamchatka Ostrog at 6° 29'. But on\r\nBering's maps the difference is only 3° 50', while in his list of\r\npositions no longitude is assigned to Lower Kamchatka post. In\r\nCampbell's list it stands at 8° 39', which the correction of an evident\r\nerror of 98° for 95° reduces to 5° 39'. The true difference of\r\nlongitude according to the latest charts is about 5° 25'. Where\r\nLauridsen got his figures he does not state. Campbell, in Harris,\r\nstates that Bering was the first navigator to double Cape Lopatka, but\r\nthe _Fortuna_ had made this voyage in 1728, though her commander is not\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nAt Bolsheretsk Bering left a crew for the _Fortuna_ which had returned\r\nthither; turned over some of his surplus stores to the local\r\nauthorities and on the 14/25 July sailed from the Bolshoia River for\r\nOkhotsk. Here he arrived July 23/Aug. 3 and after some days spent in\r\nturning over government property to the local officials and procuring\r\nhis horses and outfit, he left Okhotsk July 29/Aug. 9 on the overland\r\njourney to St. Petersburg. The second eclipse of the moon for the year\r\noccurred on this day, but during hours of daylight, and hence was\r\ninvisible in this part of Asia.\r\n\r\nAfter an uneventful but successful journey Bering arrived in St.\r\nPetersburg Mar. 1/12, 1730, bringing with him, according to Du Halde,\r\nthe map and report he had prepared upon his explorations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE OF GEOGRAPHICAL POSITIONS DERIVED FROM BERING'S FIRST VOYAGE,\r\n  REDUCED TO GREENWICH, E.

Wherever\r\nhe went he found settlements and roads such as they were. He\r\ntransported his material to Bolsheretsk and from there across the\r\npeninsula to Lower Kamchatka settlement. It would have been much easier\r\nand shorter to have doubled the peninsula and taken his stores by sea;\r\none of his party had already explored the straits near Cape Lopatka,\r\nbut there was the chance of disaster in this plan and, with his stores\r\non _terra firma_, Bering cannot be blamed for taking the land route;\r\nespecially as the difficulties would not inconvenience him personally.\r\nHe succeeded in getting his stores and shipwrights to the place\r\ndesignated and there prepared himself for the voyage. In all this there\r\nwas difficulty and trouble enough of a certain kind. That it all was\r\nsurmounted with success is very creditable to Bering and his officers.\r\nBut to call it exceptionally heroic or extraordinary, is to forget the\r\nhundreds of others who preceded Bering, without the strong arm of the\r\ngovernment at their backs, who made the trails he followed, who founded\r\nthe settlements at which he rested, who raised the dogs, the horses and\r\nthe cattle which were used or consumed by his party.\r\n\r\nWhatever praise we may feel due to Bering and his companions, and it is\r\ncertainly no stinted allowance, the appreciation of their struggles\r\ncannot fail to include with justice, the still more remarkable and\r\nnearly forgotten pioneer labors of the undaunted Siberiaks, who paved\r\nthe way, not only for Bering's weary journey, but for the slow yet\r\nnever ceasing march of civilization.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving port Bering traced the shores of Kamchatka and eastern\r\nSiberia as far as East Cape. Thence he sailed in a northeasterly\r\ndirection. At 3 P.M., Aug. 14th, land was seen astern; the vessel\r\ncontinued in the same direction until 3 P.M. the next afternoon,\r\nhaving, at most, sailed about twenty-four hours out of sight of land\r\nbut in shallow water. Bering then concluded he had gone far enough to\r\nshow the separation of Asia from America, or any land to the eastward.\r\nNo doubt he was influenced by the testimony of the residents of\r\nKamchatka who knew the work which had been performed in this region by\r\nDeshneff and others, and also by the fact that the native testimony all\r\npointed the same way. If he was convinced of the truth of this\r\ntestimony he would have been disposed to accept as conclusive evidence\r\nwhich would not be so regarded by critics. All the evidence shows\r\nBering as faithful to the letter of his orders, honest, patient with\r\nthe ill-doing or insubordination of others, but perfectly satisfied\r\nwith the accomplishment of what he had been specifically directed to\r\nperform, and with a tendency to limit the specifications to the\r\nnarrowest construction they would bear. He adventured nothing beyond.\r\nIn the arbitrary government under which he served, with the violent\r\ncompetition between foreign officers in the Russian service for\r\npromotion in rank and pay, who can criticise him for the prudence and\r\ncaution which kept him well within his instructions? I certainly do\r\nnot. But to say that he was a cautious, prudent and sagacious officer,\r\nis a different thing from asserting he was a daring, adventurous and\r\nheroic explorer. I have not been able to discover anything in his\r\ncareer justifying the latter estimate of his character.\r\n\r\nAt all events in the present case it must in time have occurred to him,\r\nor have been suggested by his officers or by the Kamchatkans after his\r\nreturn that the mere sailing off shore in admittedly shallow water for\r\ntwenty-four hours, was not an absolutely conclusive proof that the\r\ncontinents were separated. Here was a man with a new vessel, a full\r\ncrew, a year's provisions for all hands, who has come half around the\r\nglobe, taking three and a half years to do it, building ships and at no\r\nend of labor of one sort and another; all this to get into the region\r\nwhere there is a question to be answered; and when he gets there he\r\nbarely gives twenty-four hours to searching for that answer with a\r\nmonth of the season still available for work; and then starts for home\r\nwithout settling the question; with a right conclusion, it is true, but\r\nnot of his own discovery, and without securing definite proof to defy\r\ncritics.\r\n\r\nLeaving out of account the continent within half a day's sail which he\r\nfairly ran away from, ignorantly, where is there anything adventurous,\r\ndaring or heroic in such conduct?\r\n\r\nIt is evident that if Bering had sailed along the coast which the\r\nChukchis said extended to the westward, instead of going off shore,\r\naway from it, he would have confirmed that part of their testimony, and\r\ngiven high probability to the assumption of their correctness in the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nAs it was, he left the question in a state so unsettled as to be a\r\nsubject of debate for nearly half a century; even authorities so\r\nfriendly as Dr. Campbell assuming with great confidence that Bering's\r\nconclusions as to the separation of the two continents were erroneous.\r\nIt was not until the voyages of Captain Cook and his associates were\r\ngiven to the world in 1784 that the matter was settled beyond\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nEven in regard to the details of his voyage it was only through Bergh's\r\npublication of Chaplin's logbook of the voyage in 1823, that the public\r\nwere informed as to what Bering did, and it was only in 1847 that the\r\nunmutilated, but still ambiguous Report of 1730 was accessible even in\r\nRussian typography.\r\n\r\nWe find that all the authorities who published in the last century\r\ncopies of Bering's map and accounts of his expedition arrived at what\r\nLauridsen calls an \"interesting misunderstanding.\"\r\n\r\nThis misunderstanding was that he had sailed along the Chukchi coast,\r\nas above suggested, and that his farthest point was in latitude 67° 18'\r\non the coast of northeastern Siberia.\r\n\r\nHow was it possible that men of such exceptional intelligence as Du\r\nHalde and D'Anville and Müller, and Hazius, and Euler and Campbell were\r\nall so deceived?\r\n\r\nThe facts are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The verbatim Report of the voyage, the logbook of the expedition,\r\nBering's chart in its entirety, were inaccessible to the public for\r\nmany years; the chart has never been fully engraved for publication.\r\n\r\n(2) The fragments of the Report which were circulated in print were\r\nambiguous in their language or erroneously modified; while the\r\npublished reductions of the chart which got into print were misleading,\r\nor even erroneous.\r\n\r\n(3) Two conflicting versions of the manuscript chart were circulated\r\nand appear to have been officially sent out. That which appears to be\r\nthe later of the two is in some details quite erroneous and at variance\r\nwith Bering's report as printed and with the facts derived from\r\nChaplin's logbook, these two constituting the only authentic original\r\ninformation which has yet reached the public in printed form. But these\r\ntwo sources of correct data about the expedition were not printed until\r\nlong after the charts had been widely circulated, while the extracts\r\nfrom the Report which appeared in print, even under so friendly an\r\neditor as Dr. Campbell were so modified as to support rather than\r\nexpose the original error. How this arose there may be something in the\r\nRussian archives to explain, or, if not, the case seems insoluble.\r\nWhatever conclusion one arrives at, it is difficult to acquit Bering of\r\nall responsibility for the misconception, if, as Lauridsen claims, he\r\nwas responsible for the chart of Du Halde in the form it was engraved.\r\n\r\nIn his report he states that their northernmost latitude was 67° 18',\r\nthat \"all along the seacoast to this place wind elevated mountains.\" On\r\nturning to the Du Halde chart we find the range of mountains continued\r\nalong the Chukchi coast until it reaches the latitude of 67° 18' where\r\nit stops. If Bering drew the chart so, it would have been deception,\r\nbut it is quite as probable that the editor modified the chart in\r\nengraving it, to correspond to his understanding of Bering's ambiguity.\r\nAs this would present nothing questionable to the reader, in the\r\nabsence of the details omitted by Bering, it would have been nothing\r\nsurprising if Campbell's interpolation of a false longitude for Lower\r\nKamchatka, in his list of positions, might have been, not a\r\ntypographical error, but an attempt to make the position agree with\r\nthis erroneous assumption. If it was a pure accident, the coincidence\r\nis extraordinary. Of course Bering never was on this coast but Du\r\nHalde's map is so engraved as to lead directly to the false inference\r\nthat he had been.\r\n\r\nAgain Bering says in his Report that at his turning point the land no\r\nlonger extended to the north and that no projecting points could be\r\nobserved in any direction. Since he had deliberately sailed away from\r\nthe shores without attempting to follow their trend this observation\r\nwould be absurd unless we suppose it addressed to a reader who took it\r\nfor granted that the vessel was still skirting the coast. There is no\r\nmention in his Report of the fact that he had sailed away from the\r\ncoast, nor of the still more important fact that the soundings showed\r\nthat the water was comparatively shallow and discolored. Of course in\r\nthe absence of direct proof of the separation of Asia and America this\r\nlast evidence would tend to indicate that Bering was only in a bay or\r\nshallow arm of the sea and that he suppressed it shows, if not a want\r\nof candor, at least an injudicious reticence.\r\n\r\nThe map for the day when it was made (in the earlier version) was a\r\ngood one, and is appropriately praised by Cook, who had a copy of\r\nCampbell's Harris on his vessel when exploring in the same region fifty\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\nIn his report of the trip eastward from Kamchatka in 1729, Bering says\r\nnothing about the weather being foggy or stormy, but merely asserts\r\nthat he sailed nearly 200 versts and saw no trace of land. He leaves it\r\nto be inferred that he could have seen land if it had been there to\r\nsee, which if the weather was foggy was not true.\r\n\r\nThe impression which these facts leave upon the mind is that Bering did\r\ncertainly frame his language so as to convey the idea that his evidence\r\nof the separation of the two continents and of the absence of land\r\neastward from Kamchatka was more conclusive than it was in reality.\r\n\r\nThat this was done to avoid criticism seems a natural inference. That\r\nan examination of his list of positions would have shown the location\r\nof the point whence he turned back to be to the eastward of the\r\neasternmost of his reported land is true, but his list of positions was\r\nnot published with his report, does not agree with his maps, and when\r\npublished by Campbell was garbled, as I have shown.\r\n\r\nThat the truth, however, did get out and that criticism was not\r\nsuccessfully avoided, is a matter of history. There can be little doubt\r\nthat Bering's anxiety to undertake the second expedition, which\r\nfollowed, was stimulated by a desire to set these criticisms (which\r\nwould naturally be magnified by his enemies) finally at rest.\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested that Bering's report was modified by the\r\nauthorities, though why they should make these particular modifications\r\nis not very evident. Bering was the only person who could profit by\r\nthem and the natural conclusion is that he should be held responsible.\r\n\r\nIn pointing out that some of Bering's acts are vulnerable to criticism\r\nI am far from desiring to sully his memory or give the idea that he was\r\nnot entitled to great praise for what he accomplished, much of which\r\nwas admirably done.\r\n\r\nI wish merely to apply a gentle corrective to the exaggerated and\r\ninjurious flattery and undiscriminating praise which has been\r\ninjudiciously indulged in by his latest biographer.\r\n\r\nIf the interest in the subject be stimulated by discussion from these\r\nopposing points of view, so as to result in the publication of some of\r\nthe material still hidden in the Russian archives I shall be more than\r\nrepaid for the time I have devoted to the question, even if the\r\npublication of the original data should show some of my conclusions to\r\nbe ill founded or erroneous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note_--The reception of the original work of Bergh while reading the\r\nproofs of these pages has enabled me to correct several errors of\r\nprevious writers, but it was too late to incorporate here the\r\nadditional material which Bergh's work affords. This will enable me to\r\nadd, in a future publication, some historical data which have never\r\nappeared in English and which are necessary to complete the record. I\r\ndesire in this place to express my gratitude for and appreciation of\r\nthe liberality of the authorities of that ancient seat of learning, the\r\nUniversity of Upsala, as exhibited in their willingness to send such a\r\nvaluable document to a foreign student half around the world for\r\npurposes of historical research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY NOTE BY MARCUS BAKER.\r\n\r\nON THE ALLEGED OBSERVATION OF A LUNAR ECLIPSE BY BERING IN 1728-9.\r\n\r\n\r\nBering was in Eastern Siberia, Kamchatka and the adjacent waters in\r\n1728 and 1729. Could he have observed a lunar eclipse there at that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nAccording to the ephemeris of Manfred[1] published at Bonn in 1725\r\nthere were two partial eclipses of the moon visible in Europe in 1728,\r\nand two total eclipses of the moon in 1729.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Manfredius (Eustachius).

This\r\nwould make his position somewhere near latitude 55° N. and longitude\r\n160° or 10^h 40^m E. from Greenwich.\r\n\r\nHe was therefore 10^h 12^m east of Bonn for which we have the elements\r\nof this eclipse as computed by Manfred. With this data together with\r\nthe latitude and sun's declination we have the following data for the\r\neclipse in the region where Bering was.\r\n\r\n  Beginning of eclipse  4^h 44^m\r\n  Middle of eclipse     6   12\r\n  End of eclipse        7   41\r\n  Sun sets              5   07\r\n\r\nThis means that the sun set, bearing about W. by S. ½ S., and the moon\r\nrose in partial eclipse, bearing about E. by N. ½ N., at 5^h 07^m after\r\napparent noon or 23 minutes after the eclipse had begun. The eclipse\r\nlasted for 2^h 34^m after sunset, or until 7^h 41^m in the evening,\r\nthus rendering observation of the last contact plainly visible.\r\n\r\nAt the date of the _second eclipse of 1728_, August 19, Bering was at\r\nsea somewhere in the vicinity of the strait which bears his name.\r\nAssuming his position to have been latitude 65° N. and longitude 188°\r\nor 12^h 32^m E. from Greenwich, equal to 12^h 04^m E. from Bonn, and as\r\nbefore taking the data from Manfred's ephemeris we have as follows:\r\n\r\n  Beginning of eclipse  16^h 11^m\r\n  Middle of eclipse     17   39\r\n  End of eclipse        19   07\r\n  Sun rises             16   04\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the first contact of this partial eclipse of the\r\nnorthern limb of the moon may have been just barely visible to Bering.\r\nThe moon bearing about SW. by W. was entering the earth's shadow about\r\nfive minutes before the sun's rising and its own setting. If much\r\nimportance attaches to determining the possibility to Bering of\r\nobserving this eclipse then a more precise calculation is needful.\r\n\r\nAt the date of the _first lunar eclipse of 1729_, February 13, Bering\r\nwas at Lower Kamchatka, in latitude 56° 03' N. and longitude 162° 15'\r\nor 10^h 49^m E. from Greenwich equal to 10^h 21^m E. from Bonn. For\r\nthis place we have from Manfred:\r\n\r\n  Eclipse begins     18^h 06^m\r\n  Total immersion    19   07\r\n  Middle of eclipse  19   56\r\n  Emersion begins    20   45\r\n  Eclipse ends       21   46\r\n                    ----------\r\n  Sun rises          19^h 21^m\r\n\r\nThus it appears that this total and almost central eclipse of the moon\r\nlasting 3^h 40^m began at Bering's station 1^h and 15^m before sunrise\r\nof February 14, the total immersion occurring 14 minutes before\r\nsunrise. It is manifest, therefore, that Bering might have observed\r\nthis eclipse.\r\n\r\nThe _second lunar eclipse of 1729_ occurred August 8, when Bering was\r\nin or near Okhotsk and about returning to Europe. We may assume his\r\nposition to have been latitude 59° 20' N. and longitude 142° 40' or 9^h\r\n31^m E. from Greenwich, equal to 9^h 03^m E. from Bonn. This eclipse\r\nwas also total and almost central, but at Bering's station was wholly\r\ninvisible, beginning at 9^h 05^m A.M. and ending at 12^h 45^m P.M.",
