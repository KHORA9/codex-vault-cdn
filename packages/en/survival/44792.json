Ray, Linnæus, Rheaumur,\r\nand other of his cotemporaries, deserve much credit for their classing\r\nof animals, vegetables, &c. but it was BUFFON alone who entered into a\r\ndescription of their nature, habits, uses, and properties. In his Theory\r\nof the Earth he has displayed a wonderful ingenuity, and shewn the\r\ngeneral order of Nature with a masterly hand, although he may be subject\r\nto some objections for preferring physical reasonings on general\r\ncauses, rather than allowing aught to have arisen from supernatural\r\nagency, or the will of the Almighty. In this he has followed the example\r\nof all great philosophers, who seem unwilling to admit that the\r\nformation of any part of the Universe is beyond their comprehension.\r\n\r\nAs the works of this Author will best speak for themselves, we shall\r\navoid unnecessary panegyric, hoping they will have received no material\r\ninjury in the following translation; we shall therefore content\r\nourselves with observing, that in our plan we have followed that adopted\r\nby the Comte himself in a latter edition, from which he exploded his\r\nlong and minute treatises on anatomy and mensuration; though elegant and\r\nhighly finished in themselves, they appeared to us of too abstruse and\r\nconfined a nature for general estimation, and which we could not have\r\ngone into without almost doubling the expence; a circumstance we had to\r\nguard against, for the advantage of those of our readers to whom that\r\npart would have been totally uninteresting.\r\n\r\nAs to this edition, we presume it is no vain boast, that every exertion\r\nhas been made to do justice to a work of such acknowledged merit. In the\r\nliterary part, it has been the Proprietor's chief endeavour to preserve\r\nthe spirit and accuracy of the Author, as far as could be done in\r\ntranslating from one language into another; and it is with gratitude he\r\nacknowledges, that those endeavours have been amply supported by the\r\nengraver; for the decorative executions of MILTON will remain a lasting\r\nmonument of his abilities, as long as delicacy in the arts is held in\r\nestimation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUFFON's\r\n\r\nNATURAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE THEORY OF THE EARTH._\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither the figure of the earth, its motion, nor its external\r\nconnections with the rest of the universe, pertain to our present\r\ninvestigation. It is the internal structure of the globe, its\r\ncomposition, form, and manner of existence which we purpose to examine.\r\nThe general history of the earth should doubtless precede that of its\r\nproductions, as a necessary study for those who wish to be acquainted\r\nwith Nature in her variety of shapes, and the detail of facts relative\r\nto the life and manners of animals, or to the culture and vegetation of\r\nplants, belong not, perhaps, so much to Natural History, as to the\r\ngeneral deductions drawn from the observations that have been made upon\r\nthe different materials which compose the terrestrial globe: as the\r\nheights, depths, and inequalities of its form; the motion of the sea,\r\nthe direction of mountains, the situation of rocks and quarries, the\r\nrapidity and effects of currents in the ocean, &c. This is the history\r\nof nature in its most ample extent, and these are the operations by\r\nwhich every other effect is influenced and produced. The theory of these\r\neffects constitutes what may be termed a primary science, upon which the\r\nexact knowledge of particular appearances as well as terrestrial\r\nsubstances entirely depends. This description of science may fairly be\r\nconsidered as appertaining to physics; but does not all physical\r\nknowledge, in which no system is admitted, form part of the History of\r\nNature?\r\n\r\nIn a subject of great magnitude, whose relative connections are\r\ndifficult to trace, and where some facts are but partially known, and\r\nothers uncertain and obscure, it is more easy to form a visionary\r\nsystem, than to establish a rational theory; thus it is that the Theory\r\nof the Earth has only hitherto been treated in a vague and hypothetical\r\nmanner; I shall therefore but slightly mention the singular notions of\r\nsome authors who have written upon the subject.\r\n\r\nThe first hypothesis I shall allude to, deserves to be mentioned more\r\nfor its ingenuity than its reasonable solidity; it is that of an English\r\nastronomer, (WHISTON) versed in the system of NEWTON, and an\r\nenthusiastic admirer of his philosophy; convinced that every event which\r\nhappens on the terrestrial globe, depends upon the motions of the stars,\r\nhe endeavours to prove, by the assistance of mathematical calculations,\r\nthat the tail of a comet has produced every alteration the earth has\r\never undergone.\r\n\r\nThe next is the formation of an heterodox theologician, (BURNET) whose\r\nbrain was so heated with poetical visions, that he imagined he had seen\r\nthe creation of the universe. After explaining what the earth was in its\r\nprimary state, when it sprung from nothing; what changes were occasioned\r\nby the deluge; what it has been and what it is, he then assumes a\r\nprophetic style, and predicts what will be its state after the\r\ndestruction of the human race.\r\n\r\nThe third comes from a writer (WOODWARD) certainly a better and more\r\nextensive observer of nature than the two former, though little less\r\nirregular and confused in his ideas; he explains the principal\r\nappearances of the globe, by an immense abyss in the bowels of the\r\nearth, which in his opinion is nothing more than a thin crust that\r\nserves as a covering to the fluid it incloses.\r\n\r\nThe whole of these hypotheses are raised on unstable foundations; have\r\ngiven no light upon the subject, the ideas being unconnected, the facts\r\nconfused, and the whole confounded with a mixture of physic and fable;\r\nand consequently have been adopted only by those who implicitly believe\r\nopinions without investigation, and who, incapable of distinguishing\r\nprobability, are more impressed with the wonders of the marvellous than\r\nthe relation of truth.\r\n\r\nWhat we shall say on this subject will doubtless be less extraordinary,\r\nand appear unimportant, if put in comparison with the grand systems just\r\nmentioned, but it should be remembered that it is an historian's\r\nbusiness to describe, not invent; that no suppositions should be\r\nadmitted upon subjects that depend upon facts and observation; that his\r\nimagination ought only to be exercised for the purpose of combining\r\nobservations, rendering facts more general, and forming one connected\r\nwhole, so as to present to the mind a distinct arrangement of clear\r\nideas and probable conjectures; I say probable, because we must not\r\nexpect to give exact demonstration on this subject, that being confined\r\nto mathematical sciences, while our knowledge in physics and natural\r\nhistory depends solely upon experience, and is confined to reasoning\r\nupon inductions.\r\n\r\nIn the history of the Earth, we shall therefore begin with those facts\r\nthat have been obtained from the experience of time, together with what\r\nwe have collected by our own observations.\r\n\r\nThis immense globe exhibits upon its surface heights, depths, plains,\r\nseas, lakes, marshes, rivers, caverns, gulphs, and volcanos; and upon\r\nthe first view of these objects we cannot discover in their dispositions\r\neither order or regularity. If we penetrate into its internal part, we\r\nshall there find metals, minerals, stones, bitumens, sands, earths,\r\nwaters, and matters of every kind, placed as it were by chance, and\r\nwithout the smallest apparent design. Examining with a more strict\r\nattention, we discover sunk mountains, caverns filled, rocks split and\r\nbroken, countries swallowed up, and new islands rising from the ocean;\r\nwe shall also perceive heavy substances placed above light ones, hard\r\nbodies surrounded with soft; in short, we shall there find matter in\r\nevery form, wet and dry, hot and cold, solid and brittle, mixed in such\r\na sort of confusion as to leave room to compare them only to a mass of\r\nrubbish and the ruins of a wrecked world.\r\n\r\nWe inhabit these ruins however with a perfect security. The various\r\ngenerations of men, animals, and plants, succeed each other without\r\ninterruption; the earth produces fully sufficient for their subsistence;\r\nthe sea has its limits; its motions and the currents of air are\r\nregulated by fixed laws: the returns of the seasons are certain and\r\nregular; the severity of the winter being constantly succeeded by the\r\nbeauties of the spring: every thing appears in order, and the earth,\r\nformerly a CHAOS, is now a tranquil and delightful abode, where all is\r\nanimated, and regulated by such an amazing display of power and\r\nintelligence as fills us with admiration, and elevates our minds with\r\nthe most sublime ideas of an all-potent and wonderful Creator.\r\n\r\nLet us not then draw any hasty conclusions upon the irregularities of\r\nthe surface of the earth, nor the apparent disorders in the interior\r\nparts, for we shall soon discover the utility, and even the necessity of\r\nthem; and, by considering them with a little attention, we shall,\r\nperhaps, find an order of which we had no conception, and a general\r\nconnection that we could neither perceive nor comprehend, by a slight\r\nexamination: but in fact, our knowledge on this subject must always be\r\nconfined. There are many parts of the surface of the globe with which we\r\nare entirely unacquainted, and have but partial ideas of the bottom of\r\nthe sea, which in many places we have not been able to fathom. We can\r\nonly penetrate into the coat of the earth; the greatest caverns and the\r\ndeepest mines do not descend above the eight thousandth part of its\r\ndiameter, we can therefore judge only of the external and mere\r\nsuperficial part; we know, indeed, that bulk for bulk the earth weighs\r\nfour times heavier than the sun, and we also know the proportion its\r\nweight bears with other planets; but this is merely a relative\r\nestimation; we have no certain standard nor proportion; we are so\r\nentirely ignorant of the real weight of the materials, that the internal\r\npart of the globe may be a void space, or composed of matter a thousand\r\ntimes heavier than gold; nor is there any method to make further\r\ndiscoveries on this subject; and it is with the greatest difficulty any\r\nrational conjectures can be formed thereon.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore confine ourselves to a correct examination and\r\ndescription of the surface of the earth, and to those trifling depths to\r\nwhich we have been enabled to penetrate. The first object which presents\r\nitself is that immense quantity of water which covers the greatest part\r\nof the globe; this water always occupies the lowest ground, its surface\r\nalways level, and constantly tending to equilibrium and rest;\r\nnevertheless it is kept in perpetual agitation by a powerful agent,\r\nwhich opposing its natural tranquillity, impresses it with a regular\r\nperiodical motion, alternately raising and depressing its waves,\r\nproducing a vibration in the total mass, by disturbing the whole body to\r\nthe greatest depths. This motion we know has existed from the\r\ncommencement of time, and will continue as long as the sun and moon,\r\nwhich are the causes of it.\r\n\r\nBy an examination of the bottom of the sea, we discover that to be fully\r\nas irregular as the surface of the earth; we there find hills and\r\nvallies, plains and cavities, rocks and soils of every kind: we there\r\nperceive that islands are only the summits of vast mountains, whose\r\nfoundations are at the bottom of the Ocean; we also find other mountains\r\nwhose tops are nearly on a level with the surface of the water, and\r\nrapid currents which run contrary to the general movement: they\r\nsometimes run in the same direction, at others, their motions are\r\nretrograde, but never exceeding their bounds, which appear to be as\r\nfixed and invariable as those which confine the rivers of the earth. In\r\none part we meet with tempestuous regions, where the winds blow with\r\nirresistible fury, where the sea and the heavens equally agitated, join\r\nin contact with each other, are mixed and confounded in the general\r\nshock: in others, violent intestine motions, tumultuous swellings,\r\nwater-spouts, and extraordinary agitations, caused by volcanos, whose\r\nmouths though a considerable depth under water, yet vomit fire from the\r\nmidst of the waves, and send up to the clouds a thick vapour, composed\r\nof water, sulphur, and bitumen. Further we perceive dreadful gulphs or\r\nwhirlpools, which seem to attract vessels, merely to swallow them up. On\r\nthe other hand, we discover immense regions, totally opposite in their\r\nnatures, always calm and tranquil, yet equally dangerous; where the\r\nwinds never exert their power, where the art of the mariner becomes\r\nuseless, and where the becalmed voyager must remain until death relieves\r\nhim from the horrors of despair. In conclusion, if we turn our eyes\r\ntowards the northern or southern extremities of the globe, we there\r\nperceive enormous flakes of ice separating themselves from the polar\r\nregions, advancing like huge mountains into the more temperate climes,\r\nwhere they dissolve and are lost to the sight.\r\n\r\nExclusive of these principal objects the vast empire of the sea abounds\r\nwith animated beings, almost innumerable in numbers and variety. Some of\r\nthem, covered with light scales, move with astonishing celerity; others,\r\nloaded with thick shells, drag heavily along, leaving their track in the\r\nsand; on others Nature has bestowed fins, resembling wings, with which\r\nthey raise and support themselves in the air, and fly to considerable\r\ndistances; while there are those to whom all motion has been denied, who\r\nlive and die immoveably fixed to the same rock: every species, however,\r\nfind abundance of food in this their native element. The bottom of the\r\nsea, and the shelving sides of the various rocks, produce great\r\nabundance of plants and mosses of different kinds; its soil is composed\r\nof sand, gravel, rocks, and shells; in some parts a fine clay, in others\r\na solid earth, and in general it has a complete resemblance to the land\r\nwhich we inhabit.\r\n\r\nLet us now take a view of the earth. What prodigious differences do we\r\nfind in different climates? What a variety of soils? What inequalities\r\nin the surface? but upon a minute and attentive observation we shall\r\nfind the greatest chain of mountains are nearer the equator than the\r\npoles; that in the Old Continent their direction is more from the east\r\nto west than from the north to south; and that, on the contrary, in the\r\nNew World they extend more from north to south than from east to west;\r\nbut what is still more remarkable, the form and direction of those\r\nmountains, whose appearance is so very irregular, correspond so\r\nprecisely, that the prominent angles of one mountain are always\r\nopposite to the concave angles of the neighbouring mountain, and are of\r\nequal dimensions, whether they are separated by a small valley or an\r\nextensive plain. I have also observed that opposite hills are nearly of\r\nthe same height, and that, in general, mountains occupy the middle of\r\ncontinents, islands, and promontories, which they divide by the greatest\r\nlengths.\r\n\r\nIn following the courses of the principal rivers, I have likewise found\r\nthat they are almost always perpendicular with those of the sea into\r\nwhich they empty themselves; and that in the greatest part of their\r\ncourses they proceed nearly in the direction of the mountains from which\r\nthey derive their source.\r\n\r\nThe sea shores are generally bounded with rocks, marble, and other hard\r\nstones, or by earth and sand which has accumulated by the waters from\r\nthe sea, or been brought down by the rivers; and I observe that opposite\r\ncoasts, separated only by an arm of the sea, are composed of similar\r\nmaterials, and the beds of the earth are exactly the same. Volcanos I\r\nfind exist only in the highest mountains; that many of them are entirely\r\nextinct; that some are connected with others by subterraneous passages,\r\nand that their explosions frequently happen at one and the same time.\r\nThere are similar correspondences between certain lakes and neighbouring\r\nseas; some rivers suddenly disappear, and seem to precipitate themselves\r\ninto the earth. We also find internal, or mediterranean seas, constantly\r\nreceiving an enormous quantity of water from a number of rivers without\r\never extending their bounds, most probably discharging by subterraneous\r\npassages all their superfluous supplies. Lands which have been long\r\ninhabited are easily distinguished from those new countries where the\r\nsoil appears in a rude state, where the rivers are full of cataracts,\r\nwhere the earth is either overflowed with water, or parched up with\r\ndrought, and where every spot upon which a tree will grow is covered\r\nwith uncultivated woods.\r\n\r\nPursuing our examination in a more extensive view, we find that the\r\nupper strata that surrounds the globe, is universally the same. That\r\nthis substance which serves for the growth and nourishment of animals\r\nand vegetables, is nothing but a composition of decayed animal and\r\nvegetable bodies reduced into such small particles, that their former\r\norganization is not distinguishable; or penetrating a little further,\r\nwe find the real earth, beds of sand, lime-stone, argol, shells, marble,\r\ngravel, chalk, &c. These beds are always parallel to each other and of\r\nthe same thickness throughout their whole extent. In neighbouring hills\r\nbeds of the same materials are invariably found upon the same levels,\r\nthough the hills are separated by deep and extensive intervals. All beds\r\nof earth, even the most solid strata, as rocks, quarries of marble, &c.\r\nare uniformly divided by perpendicular fissures; it is the same in the\r\nlargest as well as smallest depths, and appears a rule which nature\r\ninvariably pursues.\r\n\r\nIn the very bowels of the earth, on the tops of mountains, and even the\r\nmost remote parts from the sea, shells, skeletons of fish, marine\r\nplants, &c. are frequently found, and these shells, fish, and plants,\r\nare exactly similar to those which exist in the Ocean. There are a\r\nprodigious quantity of petrified shells to be met with in an infinity of\r\nplaces, not only inclosed in rocks, masses of marble, lime-stone, as\r\nwell as in earth and clays, but are actually incorporated and filled\r\nwith the very substance which surrounds them. In short, I find myself\r\nconvinced, by repeated observations, that marbles, stones, chalks,\r\nmarls, clay, sand, and almost all terrestrial substances, wherever they\r\nmay be placed, are filled with shells and other substances, the\r\nproductions of the sea.\r\n\r\nThese facts being enumerated, let us now see what reasonable conclusions\r\nare to be drawn from them.\r\n\r\nThe changes and alterations which have happened to the earth, in the\r\nspace of the last two or three thousand years, are very inconsiderable\r\nindeed, when compared with those important revolutions which must have\r\ntaken place in those ages which immediately followed the creation; for\r\nas all terrestrial substances could only acquire solidity by the\r\ncontinued action of gravity, it would be easy to demonstrate that the\r\nsurface of the earth was much softer at first than it is at present, and\r\nconsequently the same causes which now produce but slight and almost\r\nimperceptible changes during many ages, would then effect great\r\nrevolutions in a very short space. It appears to be a certain fact, that\r\nthe earth which we now inhabit, and even the tops of the highest\r\nmountains, were formerly covered with the sea, for shells and other\r\nmarine productions are frequently found in almost every part; it appears\r\nalso that the water remained a considerable time on the surface of the\r\nearth, since in many places there have been discovered such prodigious\r\nbanks of shells, that it is impossible so great a multitude of animals\r\ncould exist at the same time: this fact seems likewise to prove, that\r\nalthough the materials which composed the surface of the earth were then\r\nin a state of softness, that rendered them easy to be disunited, moved\r\nand transported by the waters, yet that these removals were not made at\r\nonce; they must indeed have been successive, gradual, and by degrees,\r\nbecause these kind of sea productions are frequently met with more than\r\na thousand feet below the surface, and such a considerable thickness of\r\nearth and stone could not have accumulated but by the length of time. If\r\nwe were to suppose that at the Deluge all the shell-fish were raised\r\nfrom the bottom of the sea, and transported over all the earth; besides\r\nthe difficulty of establishing this supposition, it is evident, that as\r\nwe find shells incorporated in marble and in the rocks of the highest\r\nmountains, we must likewise suppose that all these marbles and rocks\r\nwere formed at the same time, and that too at the very instant of the\r\nDeluge; and besides, that previous to this great revolution there were\r\nneither mountains, marble, nor rocks, nor clays, nor matters of any kind\r\nsimilar to those we are at present acquainted with, as they almost all\r\ncontain shells and other productions of the sea. Besides, at the time of\r\nthe Deluge, the earth must have acquired a considerable degree of\r\nsolidity, from the action of gravity for more than sixteen centuries,\r\nand consequently it does not appear possible that the waters, during the\r\nshort time the Deluge lasted, should have overturned and dissolved its\r\nsurface to the greatest depths we have since been enabled to penetrate.\r\n\r\nBut without dwelling longer on this point, which shall hereafter be more\r\namply discussed, I shall confine myself to well-known observations and\r\nestablished facts. There is no doubt but that the waters of the sea at\r\nsome period covered and remained for ages upon that part of the globe\r\nwhich is now known to be dry land; and consequently the whole continents\r\nof Asia, Europe, Africa, and America, were then the bottom of an ocean\r\nabounding with similar productions to those which the sea at present\r\ncontains: it is equally certain that the different strata which compose\r\nthe earth are parallel and horizontal, and it is evident their being in\r\nthis situation is the operation of the waters which have collected and\r\naccumulated by degrees the different materials, and given them the same\r\nposition as the water itself always assumes. We observe that the\r\nposition of strata is almost universally horizontal: in plains it is\r\nexactly so, and it is only in the mountains that they are inclined to\r\nthe horizon, from their having been originally formed by a sediment\r\ndeposited upon an inclined base. Now I insist that these strata must\r\nhave been formed by degrees, and not all at once, by any revolution\r\nwhatever, because strata, composed of heavy materials, are very\r\nfrequently found placed above light ones, which could not be, if, as\r\nsome authors assert, the whole had been mixed with the waters at the\r\ntime of the Deluge, and afterwards precipitated; in that case every\r\nthing must have had a very different appearance to that which now\r\nexists. The heaviest bodies would have descended first, and each\r\nparticular stratum would have been arranged according to its weight and\r\nspecific gravity, and we should not see solid rocks or metals placed\r\nabove light sand any more than clay under coal.\r\n\r\nWe should also pay attention to another circumstance; it confirms what\r\nwe have said on the formation of the strata; no other cause than the\r\nmotions and sediments of water could possibly produce so regular a\r\nposition of it, for the highest mountains are composed of parallel\r\nstrata as well as the lowest plains, and therefore we cannot attribute\r\nthe origin and formation of mountains to the shocks of earthquakes, or\r\neruptions of volcanos. The small eminences which are sometimes raised by\r\nvolcanos, or convulsive motions of the earth, are not by any means\r\ncomposed of parallel strata, they are a mere disordered heap of matters\r\nthrown confusedly together; but the horizontal and parallel position of\r\nthe strata must necessarily proceed from the operations of a constant\r\ncause and motion, always regulated and directed in the same uniform\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nFrom repeated observations, and these incontrovertible facts, we are\r\nconvinced that the dry part of the globe, which is now habitable, has\r\nremained for a long time under the waters of the sea, and consequently\r\nthis earth underwent the same fluctuations and changes which the bottom\r\nof the ocean is at present actually undergoing. To discover therefore\r\nwhat formerly passed on the earth, let us examine what now passes at\r\nthe bottom of the sea, and from thence we shall soon be enabled to draw\r\nrational conclusions with regard to the external form and internal\r\ncomposition of that which we inhabit.\r\n\r\nFrom the Creation the sea has constantly been subject to a regular flux\r\nand reflux: this motion, which raises and falls the waters twice in\r\nevery twenty-four hours, is principally occasioned by the action of the\r\nmoon, and is much greater under the equator than in any other climates.\r\nThe earth performs a rapid motion on its axis, and consequently has a\r\ncentrifugal force, which is also the greatest at the equator; this\r\nlatter, independent of actual observation, proves that the earth is not\r\nperfectly spherical, but that it must be more elevated under the equator\r\nthen at the poles.\r\n\r\nFrom these combined causes, the ebbing and flowing of the tides, and the\r\nmotion of the earth, we may fairly conclude, that although the earth was\r\na perfect sphere in its original form, yet its diurnal motion, together\r\nwith the constant flux and reflux of the sea, must, by degrees, in the\r\ncourse of time, have raised the equatorial parts, by carrying mud,\r\nearth, sand, shells, &c. from other climes, and there depositing of\r\nthem. Agreeable to this idea the greatest irregularities must be found,\r\nand, in fact, are found near the equator. Besides, as this motion of the\r\ntides is made by diurnal alternatives, and been repeated, without\r\ninterruption, from the commencement of time, is it not natural to\r\nimagine, that each time the tide flows the water carries a small\r\nquantity of matter from one place to another, which may fall to the\r\nbottom like a sediment, and form those parallel and horizontal strata\r\nwhich are every where to be met with? for the whole motion of the water,\r\nin the flux and reflux, being horizontal, the matters carried away with\r\nthem will naturally be deposited in the same parallel direction.\r\n\r\nBut to this it may be said, that as the flux and reflux of the waters\r\nare equal and regularly succeed, two motions would counterpoise each\r\nother, and the matters brought by the flux would be returned by the\r\nreflux, and of course this cause for the formation of the strata must be\r\nchimerical; that the bottom of the sea could not experience any material\r\nalteration by two uniform motions, wherein the effects of the one would\r\nbe regularly destroyed by the other; much less could they change the\r\noriginal form by the production of heights and inequalities.\r\n\r\nTo which it may be answered, that the alternate motions of the waters\r\nare not equal, the sea having a constant motion from the east to the\r\nwest, besides, the agitation, caused by the winds, opposes and prevents\r\nthe equality of the tides. It will also be admitted, that by every\r\nmotion of which the sea is susceptible, particles of earth and other\r\nmatters will be carried from one place and deposited in another; and\r\nthese collections will necessarily assume the form of horizontal and\r\nparallel strata, from the various combinations of the motions of the sea\r\nalways tending to move the earth, and to level these materials wherever\r\nthey fall, in the form of a sediment. But this objection is easily\r\nobviated by the well-known fact, that upon all coasts, bordering the\r\nsea, where the ebbing and flowing of the tide is observed, the flux\r\nconstantly brings in a number of things which the reflux does not carry\r\nback. There are many places upon which the sea insensibly gains and\r\ngradually covers over, while there are others from which it recedes,\r\nnarrowing as it were its limits, by depositing earth, sands, shells,\r\n&c. which naturally take an horizontal position; these matters\r\naccumulate by degrees in the course of time, and being raised to a\r\ncertain point gradually exclude the water, and so become part of the dry\r\nland for ever after.\r\n\r\nBut not to leave any doubt upon this important point, let us strictly\r\nexamine into the possibility of a mountain's being formed at the bottom\r\nof the sea by the motions and sediments of the waters. It is certain\r\nthat on a coast which the sea beats with violence during the agitation\r\nof its flow, that every wave must carry off some part of the earth; for\r\nwherever the sea is bounded by rocks, it is a plain fact that the water\r\nby degrees wears away those rocks, and consequently carries away small\r\nparticles every time the waves retire; these particles of earth and\r\nstone will necessarily be transported to some distance, and being\r\narrived where the agitation of the water is abated, and left to their\r\nown weight, they precipitate to the bottom in form of a sediment, and\r\nthere form a first stratum, either horizontal or inclined, according to\r\nthe position of the surface upon which they fall; this will shortly be\r\ncovered by a similar stratum produced by the same cause, and thus will a\r\nconsiderable quantity of matter be almost insensibly collected\r\ntogether, and the strata of which will be placed, parallel to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThis mass will continue to increase by new sediments, and by gradually\r\naccumulating, in the course of time become a mountain at the bottom of\r\nthe sea, exactly similar to those we see on dry land, both as to outward\r\nform and internal composition. If there happen to be shells in this part\r\nof the sea, where we have supposed this deposit to be made, they will be\r\nfilled and covered with the sediment, and incorporated in the deposited\r\nmatter, making a part of the whole mass, and they will be found situated\r\nin the parts of the mountain according to the time they had been there\r\ndeposited; those that lay at the bottom, previous to the formation of\r\nthe first stratum, will be found in the lowest, and so according to the\r\ntime of their being deposited, the latest in the most elevated parts.\r\n\r\nSo likewise, when the bottom of the sea, at particular places, is\r\ntroubled by the agitation of the water, there will necessarily ensue, in\r\nthe same manner, a removal of earth, shells, and other matters, from the\r\ntroubled to other parts; for we are assumed by all divers, that at the\r\ngreatest depths they descend, i. e. twenty fathoms, the bottom of the\r\nsea is so troubled by the agitation of the waters, that the mud and\r\nshells are carried to considerable distances, consequently\r\ntransportations of this kind are made in every part of the sea, and this\r\nmatter falling must form eminences, composed like our mountains, and in\r\nevery respect similar; therefore the flux and reflux, by the winds, the\r\ncurrents, and all the motions of the water, must inevitably create\r\ninequalities at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nNor must we imagine that these matters cannot be transported to great\r\ndistances, because we daily see grain, and other productions of the East\r\nand West Indies, arriving on our own coasts.[25:A] It is true these\r\nbodies are specifically lighter than water, whereas the substances of\r\nwhich we have been speaking are specifically heavier; but, however,\r\nbeing reduced to an impalpable powder, they may be sustained a long time\r\nin the water so as to be conveyed to considerable distances.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that the sea is not troubled at the bottom,\r\nespecially if it is very deep, by the agitations produced by the winds\r\nand tides; but it should be recollected that the whole mass, however\r\ndeep, is put in motion by the tides, and that in a liquid globe this\r\nmotion would be communicated to the very centre; that the power which\r\nproduces the flux and reflux is a penetrating force, which acts\r\nproportionably upon every particle of its mass, so that we can determine\r\nby calculation the quantity of its force at different depths; but, in\r\nshort, this point is so certain, that it cannot be contested but by\r\nrefusing the evidence of reason.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we cannot possibly have the least doubt that the tides, the\r\nwinds, and every other cause which agitates the sea, must produce\r\neminences and inequalities at the bottom, and those heights must ever be\r\ncomposed of horizontal or equally inclined strata. These eminences will\r\ngradually encrease until they become hills, which will rise in\r\nsituations similar to the waves that produce them; and if there is a\r\nlong extent of soil, they will continue to augment by degrees; so that\r\nin course of time they will form a vast chain of mountains. Being formed\r\ninto mountains, they become an obstacle to and interrupt the common\r\nmotion of the sea, producing at the same time other motions, which are\r\ngenerally called currents. Between two neighbouring heights at the\r\nbottom of the sea a current will necessarily be formed, which will\r\nfollow their common direction, and, like a river, form a channel, whose\r\nangles will be alternately opposite during the whole extent of its\r\ncourse. These heights will be continually increasing, being subject only\r\nto the motion of the flux, for the waters during the flow will leave the\r\ncommon sediment upon their ridges; and those waters which are impelled\r\nby the current will force along with them, to great distances, those\r\nmatters which would be deposited between both, at the same time\r\nhollowing out a valley with corresponding angles at their foundation. By\r\nthe effects of these motions and sediments the bottom of the sea,\r\nalthough originally smooth, must become unequal, and abounding with\r\nhills and chains of mountains, as we find it at present. The soft\r\nmaterials of which the eminences are originally composed will harden by\r\ndegrees with their own weight; some forming parts, purely angular,\r\nproduce hills of clay; others, consisting of sandy and crystalline\r\nparticles, compose those enormous masses of rock and flint from whence\r\ncrystal and other precious stones are extracted; those formed with stony\r\nparticles, mixed with shells, form those of lime-stone and marble,\r\nwherein we daily meet with shells incorporated; and others, compounded\r\nof matter more shelly, united with pure earth, compose all our beds of\r\nmarle and chalk. All these substances are placed in regular beds, and\r\nall contain heterogeneous matter; marine productions are found among\r\nthem in abundance, and nearly according to the relation of their\r\nspecific weights; the lightest shells in chalk, and the heaviest in clay\r\nand lime-stone; these shells are invariably filled with the matter in\r\nwhich they have been inclosed, whether stones or earth; an incontestible\r\nproof that they have been transported with the matter that fills and\r\nsurrounds them, and that this matter was at that time in an impalpable\r\npowder. In short, all those substances whose horizontal situations have\r\nbeen established by the level of the waters of the sea, will constantly\r\npreserve their original position.\r\n\r\nBut here it may be observed, that most hills, whose summits consist of\r\nsolid rocks, stone, or marble, are formed upon small eminences of much\r\nlighter materials, such for instance as clay, or strata of sand, which\r\nwe commonly find extended over the neighbouring plains, upon which it\r\nmay be asked, how, if the foregoing theory be just, this seemingly\r\ncontradictory arrangement happens? To me this phenomenon appears to be\r\nvery easy and naturally explained. The water at first acts upon the\r\nupper stratum of coasts, or bottom of the sea, which commonly consists\r\nof clay or sand, and having transported this, and deposited the\r\nsediment, it of course composes small eminences, which form a base for\r\nthe more heavy particles to rest upon. Having removed the lighter\r\nsubstances, it operates upon the more heavy, and by constant attrition\r\nreduces them to an impalpable powder; which it conveys to the same spot,\r\nand where, being deposited, these stony particles, in the course of\r\ntime, form those solid rocks and quarries which we now find upon the\r\ntops of hills and mountains. It is not unlikely that as these particles\r\nare much heavier than sand or clay, that they were formerly a\r\nconsiderable depth under a strata of that kind, and now owe their high\r\nsituations to having been last raised up and transported by the motion\r\nof the water.\r\n\r\nTo confirm what we here assert, let us more closely investigate the\r\nsituation of those materials which compose the superficial outer part of\r\nthe globe, indeed the only part with which we have any knowledge. The\r\ndifferent beds of strata in stone quarries are almost all horizontal, or\r\nregularly inclined; those whose foundations are on clays or other solid\r\nmatters are clearly horizontal, especially in plains. The quarries\r\nwherein we find flint, or brownish grey free-stone, in detached\r\nportions, have a less regular position, but even in those the uniformity\r\nof nature plainly appears, for the horizontal or regularly inclined\r\nstrata are apparent in quarries where these stones are found in great\r\nmasses. This position is universal, except in quarries where flint and\r\nbrown free-stone are found in small detached portions, the formation of\r\nwhich we shall prove to have been posterior to those we have just been\r\ntreating of; for granite, vitrifiable sand, argol, marble, calcareous\r\nstone, chalk, and marles, are always deposited in parallel strata,\r\nhorizontally or equally inclined; the original formation of these are\r\neasily discovered, for the strata are exactly horizontal and very thin,\r\nand are arranged above each other like the leaves of a book. Beds of\r\nsand, soft and hard clay, chalk, and shells, are also either horizontal\r\nor regularly inclined. Strata of every kind preserves the same thickness\r\nthroughout its whole extent, which often occupies the space of many\r\nmiles, and may be traced still farther by close and exact observations.\r\nIn a word, the materials of the globe, as far as mankind have been\r\nenabled to penetrate, are arranged in an uniform position, and are\r\nexactly similar.\r\n\r\nThe strata of sand and gravel which have been washed down from mountains\r\nmust in some measure be excepted; in vallies they are sometimes of a\r\nconsiderable extent, and are generally placed under the first strata of\r\nthe earth; in plains, they are as even as the most ancient and interior\r\nstrata, but near the bottom and upon the ridges of hills they are\r\ninclined, and follow the inclination of the ground upon which they have\r\nflowed. These being formed by rivers and rivulets, which are constantly\r\nin vallies changing their beds, and dragging these sands and gravel with\r\nthem, they are of course very numerous. A small rivulet flowing from the\r\nneighbouring heights, in the course of time will be sufficient to cover\r\na very spacious valley with a strata of sand and gravel, and I have\r\noften observed in hilly countries, whose base, as well as the upper\r\nstratum, was hard clay, that above the source of the rivulet the clay is\r\nfound immediately under the vegetable soil, and below it there is the\r\nthickness of a foot of sand upon the clay, and which extends itself to a\r\nconsiderable distance. These strata formed by rivers are not very\r\nancient, and are easily discovered by the inequality of their thickness,\r\nwhich is constantly varying, while the ancient strata preserves the same\r\ndimensions throughout; they are also to be known by the matter itself,\r\nwhich bears evident marks of having been smoothed and rounded by the\r\nmotions of the water. The same may be said of the turf and perished\r\nvegetables which are found below the first stratum of earth in marshy\r\ngrounds; they cannot be considered as ancient, but entirely produced by\r\nsuccessive heaps of decayed trees and other plants. Nor are the strata\r\nof slime and mud, which are found in many countries, to be considered as\r\nancient productions, having been formed by stagnated waters or\r\ninundations of rivers, and are neither so horizontal, nor equally\r\ninclined, as the strata anciently produced by the regular motions of the\r\nsea. In the strata formed by rivers we constantly meet with river, but\r\nscarcely ever sea shells, and the few that are found are broken and\r\nirregularly placed; whereas in the ancient strata there are no river\r\nshells; the sea shells are in great quantities, well preserved, and all\r\nplaced in the same manner, having been transported at the same time and\r\nby the same cause. How are we to account for this astonishing\r\nregularity? Instead of regular strata, why do we not meet with the\r\nmatters that compose the earth jumbled together, without any kind of\r\norder? Why are not rocks, marbles, clays, marles, &c. variously\r\ndispersed, or joined by irregular or vertical strata? Why are not the\r\nheaviest bodies uniformly found placed beneath the lightest? It is easy\r\nto perceive that this uniformity of nature, this organization of earth,\r\nthis connection of different materials, by parallel strata, without\r\nrespect to their weights, could only be produced by a cause as powerful\r\nand constant as the motion of the sea, whether occasioned by the regular\r\nwinds or by that of the flux and reflux, &c.\r\n\r\nThese causes act with greater force under the equator than in other\r\nclimates, for there the winds are more regular and the tides run\r\nhigher; the most extensive chains of mountains are also near the\r\nequator. The mountains of Africa and Peru are the highest known, they\r\nfrequently extend themselves through whole provinces, and stretch, to\r\nconsiderable distances under the ocean. The mountains of Europe and\r\nAsia, which extend from Spain to China, are not so high as those of\r\nSouth America and Africa. The mountains of the North, according to the\r\nrelation of travellers, are only hills in comparison with those of the\r\nSouthern countries. Besides, there are very few islands in the Northern\r\nSeas, whereas in the torrid zone they are almost innumerable, and as\r\nislands are only the summits of mountains, it is evident that the\r\nsurface of the earth has many more inequalities towards the equator than\r\nin the northerly climes.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore evident that the prodigious chain of mountains which run\r\nfrom the West to the East in the old continent, and from the North to\r\nthe South in the new, must have been produced by the general motion of\r\nthe tides; but the origin of all the inferior mountains must be\r\nattributed to the particular motions of currents, occasioned by the\r\nwinds and other irregular agitations of the sea: they may probably have\r\nbeen produced by a combination of all those motions, which must be\r\ncapable of infinite variations, since the winds and different positions\r\nof islands and coasts change the regular course of the tides, and compel\r\nthem to flow in every possible direction: it is, therefore, not in the\r\nleast astonishing that we should see considerable eminences, whose\r\ncourses have no determined direction. But it is sufficient for our\r\npresent purpose to have demonstrated that mountains are not the produce\r\nof earthquakes, or other accidental causes, but that they are the\r\neffects resulting from the general order of nature, both as to their\r\norganization and the position of the materials of which they are\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\nBut how has it happened that this earth which we and our ancestors have\r\ninhabited for ages, which, from time immemorial, has been an immense\r\ncontinent, dry and removed from the reach of the waters, should, if\r\nformerly the bottom of the ocean, be actually larger than all the\r\nwaters, and raised to such a height as to be distinctly separated from\r\nthem? Having remained so long on the earth, why have the waters now\r\nabandoned it? What accident, what cause could produce so great a\r\nchange? Is it possible to conceive one possessed of sufficient power to\r\nproduce such an amazing effect?\r\n\r\nThese questions are difficult to be resolved, but as the facts are\r\ncertain and incontrovertible, the exact manner in which they happened\r\nmay remain unknown, without prejudicing the conclusions that may be\r\ndrawn from them; nevertheless, by a little reflection, we shall find at\r\nleast plausible reasons for these changes. We daily observe the sea\r\ngaining ground on some coasts and losing it on others; we know that the\r\nocean has a continued regular motion from East to West; that it makes\r\nloud and violent efforts against the low lands and rocks which confine\r\nit; that there are whole provinces which human industry can hardly\r\nsecure from the rage of the sea; that there are instances of islands\r\nrising above, and others being sunk under the waters. History speaks of\r\nmuch greater deluges and inundations. Ought not this to incline us to\r\nbelieve that the surface of the earth has undergone great revolutions,\r\nand that the sea may have quitted the greatest part of the earth which\r\nit formerly covered? Let us but suppose that the old and new worlds were\r\nformerly but one continent, and that the Atlantis of Plato was sunk by\r\na violent earthquake; the natural consequence would be, that the sea\r\nwould necessarily have flowed in from all sides, and formed what is now\r\ncalled the Atlantic Ocean, leaving vast continents dry, and possibly\r\nthose which we now inhabit. This revolution, therefore, might be made of\r\na sudden by the opening of some vast cavern in the interior part of the\r\nglobe, which an universal deluge must inevitably succeed; or possibly\r\nthis change was not effected at once, but required a length of time,\r\nwhich I am rather inclined to think; however these conjectures may be,\r\nit is certain the revolution has occurred, and in my opinion very\r\nnaturally; for to judge of the future, as well as the past, we must\r\ncarefully attend to what daily happens before our eyes. It is a fact\r\nclearly established by repeated observations of travellers, that the\r\nocean has a constant motion from the East to West; this motion, like the\r\ntrade winds, is not only felt between the tropics, but also throughout\r\nthe temperate climates, and as near the poles as navigators have gone;\r\nof course the Pacific Ocean makes a continual effort against the coasts\r\nof Tartary, China, and India; the Indian Ocean acts against the east\r\ncoast of Africa; and the Atlantic in like manner against all the eastern\r\ncoasts of America; therefore the sea must have always and still\r\ncontinues to gain land on the east and lose it on the west; and this\r\nalone is sufficient to prove the possibility of the change Of earth into\r\nsea, and sea into land. If, in fact, such are the effects of the sea's\r\nmotion from east to west, may we not very reasonably suppose that Asia\r\nand the eastern continent is the oldest country in the world, and that\r\nEurope and part of Africa, especially the western coasts of these\r\ncontinents, as Great Britain, France, Spain, Muratania, &c. are of a\r\nmore modern date? Both history and physics agree in confirming this\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many other causes which concur with the continual\r\nmotion of the sea from east to west, in producing these effects.\r\n\r\nIn many places there are lands lower than the level of the sea, and\r\nwhich are only defended from it by an isthmus of rocks, or by banks and\r\ndykes of still weaker materials; these barriers must gradually be\r\ndestroyed by the constant action of the sea, when the lands will be\r\noverflowed, and constantly make part of the ocean. Besides, are not\r\nmountains daily decreasing by the rains, which loosen the earth, and\r\ncarry it down into the vallies? It is also well known that floods wash\r\nthe earth from the plains and high grounds into the small brooks and\r\nrivers, which in their turn convey it into the sea. By these means the\r\nbottom of the sea is filling up by degrees, the surface of the earth\r\nlowering to a level, and nothing but time is necessary for the sea's\r\nsuccessively changing places with the earth.\r\n\r\nI speak not here of those remote causes which stand above our\r\ncomprehension; of those convulsions of nature, whose least effects would\r\nbe fatal to the world; the near approach of a comet, the absence of the\r\nmoon, the introduction of a new planet, &c. are suppositions on which it\r\nis easy to give scope to the imagination. Such causes would produce any\r\neffects we chose, and from a single hypothesis of this nature, a\r\nthousand physical romances might be drawn, and which the authors might\r\nterm, THE THEORY OF THE EARTH. As historians we reject these vain\r\nspeculations; they are mere possibilities which suppose the destruction\r\nof the universe, in which our globe, like a particle of forsaken matter,\r\nescapes our observation, and is no longer an object worthy regard; but\r\nto preserve consistency, we must take the earth as it is, closely\r\nobserving every part, and by inductions judge of the future from what\r\nexists at present; in other respects we ought not to be affected by\r\ncauses which seldom happen, and whose effects are always sudden and\r\nviolent; they do not occur in the common course of nature; but effects\r\nwhich are daily repeated, motions which succeed each other without\r\ninterruption, and operations that are constant, ought alone to be the\r\nground of our reasoning.\r\n\r\nWe will add some examples thereto; we will combine particular effects\r\nwith general causes, and give a detail of facts which will render\r\napparent, and explain the different changes that the earth has\r\nundergone, whether by the eruption of the sea upon the land, or by\r\nretiring from that which it had formerly covered.\r\n\r\nThe greatest eruption was certainly that which gave rise to the\r\nMediterranean sea. The ocean flows through a narrow channel between two\r\npromontories with great rapidity, and then forms a vast sea, which,\r\nwithout including the Black sea, is about seven times larger than the\r\nkingdom of France. Its motion through the straits of Gibraltar is\r\ncontrary to all other straits, for the general motion of the sea is from\r\neast to west, but in that alone it is from the west to the east, which\r\nproves that the Mediterranean sea is not an ancient gulph, but that it\r\nhas been formed by an eruption, produced by some accidental cause; as an\r\nearthquake which might swallow up the earth in the strait, or by a\r\nviolent effort of the ocean, caused by the wind, which might have forced\r\nits way through the banks between the promontories of Gibraltar and\r\nCeuta. This opinion is authorised by the testimony of the ancients, who\r\ndeclare in their writings, that the Mediterranean sea did not formerly\r\nexist; and confirmed by natural history and observations made on the\r\nopposite coasts of Spain, where similar beds of stones and earth are\r\nfound upon the same levels, in like manner as they are in two mountains,\r\nseparated by a small valley.\r\n\r\nThe ocean having forced this passage, it ran at first through the\r\nstraits with much greater rapidity than at present, and overflowed the\r\ncontinent that joined Europe to Africa. The waters covered all the low\r\ncountries, of which we can only now perceive the tops of some of the\r\nconsiderable mountains, such as parts of Italy, the islands of Sicily,\r\nMalta, Corsica, Sardinia, Cyprus, Rhodes, and those of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nIn this eruption I have not included the Black sea, because the quantity\r\nof water it receives from the Danube, Nieper, Don, and various other\r\nrivers, is fully sufficient to form and support it; and besides, it\r\nflows with great rapidity through the Bosphorus into the Mediterranean.\r\nIt might also be presumed that the Black and Caspian seas were formerly\r\nonly two large lakes, joined by a narrow communication, or by a morass,\r\nor small lake, which united the Don and the Wolga near Tria, where these\r\ntwo rivers flow near each other; nor is it improbable that these two\r\nseas or lakes were then of much greater extent, for the immense rivers\r\nwhich fall into the Black and Caspian seas may have brought down a\r\nsufficient quantity of earth to shut up the communication, and form that\r\nneck of land by which they are now separated; for we know great rivers,\r\nin the course of time, fill up seas and form new land, as the province\r\nat the mouth of the Yellow river in China; Louisania at the mouth of the\r\nMississippi, and the northern part of Egypt, which owes its existence to\r\nthe inundations of the Nile; the rapidity of which brings down such\r\nquantities of earth from the internal parts of Africa, as to deposit on\r\nthe shores, during the inundations, a body of slime and mud of more than\r\nfifty feet in depth. The province of the Yellow river and Louisania\r\nhave, in like manner, been formed by the soil from the rivers.\r\n\r\nThe Caspian sea is actually a real lake; having no communication with\r\nother seas, not even with the lake Aral, which seems to have been a part\r\nof it, being only separated from it by a large track of sand, in which\r\nneither rivers nor canals for communication the waters have as yet been\r\nfound. This sea, therefore, has no external communication with any\r\nother; and I do not know that we are authorised to suspect that it has\r\nan internal one with the Black sea, or with the Gulph of Persia. It is\r\ntrue the Caspian sea receives the Wolga and many other rivers, which\r\nseem to furnish it with more water than is lost by evaporation; but\r\nindependent of the difficulty of such calculation, if it had a\r\ncommunication with any other sea, a constant and rapid current towards\r\nthe opening would have marked its course, and I never heard of any such\r\ndiscovery being made; travellers of the best credit affirm to the\r\ncontrary, and consequently the Caspian sea must lose by evaporation just\r\nas much water as it receives from the Wolga and other rivers.\r\n\r\nNor is it any improbable conjecture that the Black sea will at some\r\nperiod be separated from the Mediterranean; and that the Bosphorus will\r\nbe shut up, whenever the great rivers shall have accumulated a\r\nsufficient quantity of earth to answer that effect; this may be the case\r\nin the course of time by the successive diminution of waters in rivers,\r\nin proportion as the mountains from whence they draw their sources are\r\nlowered by the rains, and those other causes we have just alluded to.\r\n\r\nThe Caspian and Black seas must therefore be looked upon rather as lakes\r\nthan gulphs of the ocean, for they resemble other lakes which receive a\r\nnumber of rivers without any apparent outlet, such as the Dead sea,\r\nmany lakes in Africa and other places. These two seas are not near so\r\nsalt as the Mediterranean or the ocean; and all voyagers affirm that the\r\nnavigation in the Black and Caspian seas, upon account of its\r\nshallowness and quantity of rocks and quicksands, is so extremely\r\ndangerous, that only small vessels can be used with safety which farther\r\nproves they must not be looked upon as gulphs of the ocean, but as\r\nimmense bodies of water collected from great rivers.\r\n\r\nA considerable eruption of the sea would doubtless take place upon the\r\nearth, if the isthmus which separates Africa from Asia was divided, as\r\nthe Kings of Egypt, and afterwards the Caliphs projected; and I do not\r\nknow that the communication between the Red sea and Mediterranean is\r\nsufficiently established, as the former must be higher than the latter.\r\nThe Red sea is a narrow branch of the ocean, and does not receive into\r\nit a single river on the side of Egypt, and very few on the opposite\r\ncoast; it will not therefore be subject to diminution, like those seas\r\nand lakes which are constantly receiving slime and sand from those\r\nrivers that flow into them. The ocean supplies the Red sea with all its\r\nwater, and the motion of the tides is very evident in it, of course it\r\nmust be affected by every movement of the ocean. But the Mediterranean\r\nmust be lower than the ocean, because the current passes with great\r\nrapidity through the straits; besides, it receives the Nile, which flows\r\nparallel to the west coast of the Red sea, and which divides Egypt, a\r\nvery low country; from all which it appears probable, that the Red sea\r\nis higher than the Mediterranean, and that if the isthmus of Suez was\r\ncut through, there Would be a great inundation, and a considerable\r\naugmentation of the Mediterranean would ensue; at least if the waters\r\nwere not restrained by dykes and sluices placed at proper distances, and\r\nwhich was most likely the case if the ancient canal of communication\r\never had existence.\r\n\r\nWithout dwelling longer upon conjectures, which, although well founded,\r\nmay appear hazardous and rash, we shall give some recent and certain\r\nexamples of the change of the sea into land, and the land into sea. At\r\nVenice the bottom of the Adriatic is daily rising, and if great care had\r\nnot been taken to clean and empty the canals, the whole would long\r\nsince have formed part of the continent; the same may be said of most\r\nports, bays, and mouths of rivers. In Holland the bottom of the sea has\r\nrisen in many places; the gulph of Zuyderzee and the strait of the Texel\r\ncannot receive such large vessels as formerly. At the mouth of all\r\nrivers we find small islands, and banks of sand and earth brought down\r\nby the waters, and it is certain the sea will be filled up in every part\r\nwhere great rivers empty themselves. The Rhine is lost in the sands\r\nwhich itself accumulated. The Danube and the Nile, and all great rivers,\r\nafter bringing down much sand and earth, no longer come to the sea by a\r\nsingle channel; they divide into different branches, and the intervals\r\nare filled up by the materials they have themselves brought thither.\r\nMorasses daily dry up; lands forsaken by the sea are cultivated; we\r\nnavigate countries now covered by waters; in short, we see so many\r\ninstances of land changing into water, and water into land, that we must\r\nbe convinced of these alterations having, and will continue to take\r\nplace; so that in time gulphs will become continents; isthmusses,\r\nstraits; morasses, dry lands; and the tops of our mountains, the shoals\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nSince then the waters have covered, and may successively cover, every\r\npart of the present dry land, our surprise must cease at finding every\r\nwhere marine productions and compositions, which could only be the works\r\nof the waters. We have already explained how the horizontal strata of\r\nthe earth were formed, but the perpendicular divisions that are commonly\r\nfound in rocks, clays, and all matters of which the globe is composed,\r\nstill remain to be considered. These perpendicular stratas are, in fact,\r\nplaced much farther from each other than the horizontal, and the softer\r\nthe matter the greater the distance; in marble and hard earths they are\r\nfrequently found only a few feet; but if the mass of rock be very\r\nextensive, then these fissures are at some fathoms distant; sometimes\r\nthey descend from the top of the rock to the bottom, and sometimes\r\nterminate at an horizontal fissure. They are always perpendicular in the\r\nstrata of calcinable matters, as chalk, marle, marble, &c. but are more\r\noblique and irregularly placed in vitrifiable substances, brown\r\nfreestone, and rocks of flint, where they are frequently adorned with\r\nchrystals, and other minerals. In quarries of marble or calcinable\r\nstone, the divisions are filled with spar, gypsum, gravel, and an earthy\r\nsand, which contains a great quantity of chalk. In clay, marls, and\r\nevery other kind of earth, excepting turf, these perpendicular divisions\r\nare either empty or filled with such matters as the water has\r\ntransported thither.\r\n\r\nWe need seek very little farther for the cause and origin of those\r\nperpendicular cracks. The materials by which the different strata are\r\ncomposed being carried by the water, and deposited as a kind of\r\nsediment, must necessarily, at first, contain a considerable share of\r\nwater, the which, as they began to harden, they would part with by\r\ndegrees, and, as they must necessarily lessen in the course of drying,\r\nthat decrease would occasion them to split at irregular distances. They\r\nnaturally split in a perpendicular direction, because in that direction\r\nthe action of gravity of one particle upon another has no actual effect,\r\nwhile, on the contrary, it is directly opposite in a horizontal\r\nsituation; the diminution of bulk therefore could have no sensible\r\neffect but in a vertical line. I say it is the diminution of drying, and\r\nnot the contained water forcing a place to issue, is the cause of these\r\nperpendicular fissures, for I have often observed that the two sides of\r\nthose fissures answer throughout their whole height, as exactly as two\r\nsides of a split piece of wood; their insides are rough and irregular,\r\nwhereas if they had been made by the motion of the water, they would\r\nhave been smooth and polished; therefore these cracks must be produced\r\nsuddenly and at once or by degrees in drying, like the flaws in wood,\r\nand the greatest part of the water they contained evaporated through the\r\npores. The divisions of these perpendicular cracks vary greatly as to\r\nthe extent of their openings; some of them being not more than half an\r\ninch, others increasing to one or two feet; there are some many fathoms,\r\nand which form those precipices so often met with in the Alps and other\r\nhigh mountains. The small ones are produced by drying alone, but those\r\nwhich extend to several feet are the effects of other causes; for\r\ninstance, the sinking of the foundation on one side while the other\r\nremains unmoved; if the base sinks but a line or two, it is sufficient\r\nto produce openings of many feet in a rock of considerable height.\r\nSometimes rocks, which are founded on clay or sand, incline to one\r\nside, by which motion the perpendicular cracks become extended.\r\n\r\nI have not yet mentioned those large openings which are found in rocks\r\nand mountains; they must have been produced by great sinkings, as of\r\nimmense caverns, unable longer to support the weight with which they\r\nwere encumbered, but these intervals are very different from\r\nperpendicular fissures; they appear to be vacancies opened by the hand\r\nof Nature for the communication of nations. In this manner all vacancies\r\nin large mountains and divisions, by straits in the sea, seem to present\r\nthemselves; such as the straits of Thermopylæ, the ports of Caucasus,\r\nthe Cordeliers, the extremity of the straits of Gibraltar, the entrance\r\nof the Hellespont, &c. These could not have been occasioned by the\r\nsimple separation by drying of matter, but by considerable parts of the\r\nlands themselves being sunk, swallowed up, or overturned.\r\n\r\nThese great sinkings, though produced by accidental causes, hold a first\r\nplace in the principal circumstances in the History of the Earth, and\r\nnot a little contributed to change the face of the Globe; the greatest\r\npart of them have been produced by subterraneous fires, whose\r\nexplosions cause earthquakes and volcanos; the force of these inflamed\r\nand confined matters in the bowels of the earth is beyond compare; by it\r\ncities have been swallowed up, provinces overturned, and mountains\r\noverthrown. But however great this force may be, and prodigious as the\r\neffects appear, we cannot assent to the opinion of those authors who\r\nsuppose these subterraneous fires proceed from an immense abyss of flame\r\nin the centre of the earth, neither give we credit to the common notion\r\nthat they proceed from a great depth below the surface of the earth, air\r\nbeing absolutely necessary for the support of inflammation. In examining\r\nthe materials which issue from volcanos, even in the most violent\r\neruptions, it appears very plain, that the furnace of the inflamed\r\nmatters is not at any great depth, as they are similar to those found in\r\nmountains, disfigured only by the calcination, and the melting of the\r\nmetallic parts which they contain; and to be convinced that the matters\r\ncast out by volcanos do not come from any great depth, we have only to\r\nconsider of the height of the mountain, and judge of the immense force\r\nthat would be necessary to cast up stones and minerals to the height of\r\nhalf a league; for Ætna, Hecla, and many other volcanos have at least\r\nthat elevation from the plains. Now it is perfectly well known that the\r\naction of fire is equal in every direction; it cannot therefore act\r\nupwards, with a force capable of throwing large stones half a league\r\nhigh, without an equal re-action downwards, and on the sides, and which\r\nre-action must very soon pierce and destroy the mountain on every side,\r\nbecause the materials which compose it are not more dense and firm than\r\nthose thrown out; how then can it be imagined that the cavity, which\r\nmust be considered as the type or cannon, could resist so great a force\r\nas would be necessary to raise those bodies to the mouth of the volcano?\r\nBesides, if this cavity was deeper, as the external orifice is not\r\ngreat, it would be impossible for so large a quantity of inflamed and\r\nliquid matter to issue out at once, without clashing against each other,\r\nand against the sides of the tube, and by passing through so long a\r\nspace they would run the chance of being extinguished and hardened. We\r\noften see rivers of bitumen and melted sulphur, thrown out of the\r\nvolcanos with stones and minerals, flow from the tops of the mountains\r\ninto the plains; is it natural to imagine that matters so fluid, and so\r\nlittle able to resist violent action, should be elevated from any great\r\ndepth? All the observations that can be made on this subject will prove\r\nthat the fire of the volcano is not far from the summit of the mountain,\r\nand that it never descends to the level of the plain.\r\n\r\nThis idea of volcanos does not, however, render it inconsistent that\r\nthey are the cause of earthquakes, and that their shocks may be felt on\r\nthe plains to very considerable distances; nor that one volcano may not\r\ncommunicate with another by means of subterraneous passages; but it is\r\nof the depth of the fire's confinement that we now speak, and which can\r\nonly be at a small distance from the mouth of the volcano. It is not\r\nnecessary to produce an earthquake on a plain, that the bottom of the\r\nvolcano should be below the level of that plain; nor that there should\r\nbe internal cavities filled with the same combustible matter, for a\r\nviolent explosion, such as generally attends an eruption, may, like that\r\nof a powder magazine give so great a shock by its re-action, as to\r\nproduce an earthquake that might be felt at a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that there are no earthquakes produced by\r\nsubterraneous fires, but merely that there are some which proceed only\r\nfrom the explosion of volcanos. In confirmation of what has been\r\nadvanced on this subject, it is certain that volcanos are seldom met\r\nwith on plains; on the contrary, they are constantly found in the\r\nhighest mountains, and their mouths at the very summit of them. If the\r\ninternal fires of the volcanos extended below the plains, would not\r\npassages be opened in them during violent eruptions? In the first\r\neruption would not these fires rather have pierced the plains, where, by\r\ncomparison, the resistance must be infinitely weaker, than force their\r\nway through a mountain more than half a league in height.\r\n\r\nThe reason why volcanos appear alone in mountains, is, because much\r\ngreater quantities of minerals, sulphur, and pyrites, are contained in\r\nmountains, and more exposed than in the plains; besides which, those\r\nhigh places are more subject to the impressions of air, and receive\r\ngreater quantities of rain and damps, by which mineral substances are\r\ncapable of being heated and fermented into an absolute state of\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\nIn short, it has often been observed, that, after violent eruptions, the\r\nmountains have shrunk and diminished in proportion to the quantity of\r\nmatter which has been thrown out; another proof that the volcanos are\r\nnot situated at the bottom of the mountain, but rather at no great\r\ndistance from the summit itself.\r\n\r\nIn many places earthquakes have formed considerable hollows, and even\r\nseparations in mountains; all other inequalities have been produced at\r\nthe same time with the mountains themselves by the currents of the sea,\r\nfor in every place where there has not been a violent convulsion, the\r\nstrata of the mountains are parallel, and their angles exactly\r\ncorrespond. Those subterraneous caverns which have been produced by\r\nvolcanos are easily to be distinguished from those formed by water; for\r\nthe water, having washed away the sand and clay with which they are\r\nfilled, leaves only the stones and rocks, and this is the origin of\r\ncaverns upon hills; while those found upon the plains are commonly\r\nnothing but ancient pits and quarries, such as the salt quarries of\r\nMaestricht, the mines of Poland, &c. But natural caverns belong to\r\nmountains: they receive the water from the summit and its environs, from\r\nwhence it issues over the surface wherever it can obtain a passage; and\r\nthese are the sources of springs and rivers, and whenever a cavern is\r\nfilled by any part falling in, an inundation generally ensues.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have related, it is easy to be seen how much subterraneous\r\nfires contribute to change the surface and internal part of the globe.\r\nThis cause is sufficiently powerful to produce very great effects: but\r\nit is difficult to conceive how the winds should occasion any sensible\r\nalterations upon the earth. The sea appears to be their empire, and\r\nindeed, excepting the tides, nothing has so powerful an influence upon\r\nthe ocean; even the flux and reflux move in an uniform manner, and their\r\neffects are regularly the same; but the action of the winds is\r\ncapricious and violent; they sometimes rush on with such impetuosity,\r\nand agitate the sea with such violence, that from a calm, smooth, and\r\ntranquil plain, it becomes furrowed with waves rolling mountains high,\r\nand dashing themselves to pieces against the rocks and shores. The winds\r\ncause constant alterations on the surface of the sea, but the surface of\r\nthe land, which has so solid an appearance, we should suppose would not\r\nbe subject to similar effects; by experience, however, it is known that\r\nthe winds raise mountains of sand in Arabia and Africa; and that they\r\ncover plains with it; they frequently transport sand to great distances,\r\nand many miles into the sea, where they accumulate in such quantities as\r\nto form banks, downs, and even islands. It is also known that hurricanes\r\nare the scourge of the Antilles, Madagascar, and other countries, where\r\nthey act with such fury, as to sweep away trees, plants, and animals,\r\ntogether with the soil which gave them subsistence: they cause rivers to\r\nascend and descend, and produce new ones; they overthrow rocks and\r\nmountains; they make holes and gulphs on the earth, and entirely change\r\nthe face of those unfortunate countries where they exist. Happily there\r\nare but few climates exposed to the impetuosity of those dreadful\r\nagitations of the air.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest and most general changes in the surface of the earth\r\nare produced by rains, floods, and torrents from the high lands. Their\r\norigins proceed from the vapours which the sun raises above the surface\r\nof the ocean, and which the wind transports through every climate. These\r\nvapours, which are sustained in the air, and conveyed at the will of the\r\nwinds, are stopped in their progress by the tops of the hills which they\r\nencounter, where they accumulate until they become clouds and fall in\r\nthe form of rain, dew, or snow. These waters at first descend upon the\r\nplains without any fixed course, but by degrees hollow out a bed for\r\nthemselves; by their natural bent they run to the bottom of mountains,\r\nand penetrating or dissolving the land easiest to divide, they carry\r\nearth and sand away with them, cut deep channels in the plains, form\r\nthemselves into rivers, and open a passage into the sea, which\r\nconstantly receives as much water from the land rivers as it loses by\r\nevaporation. The windings in the channels of rivers have sinuosities,\r\nwhose angles are correspondent to each other, so that where the waves\r\nform a saliant angle on one side, the other has an exactly opposite one;\r\nand as hills and mountains, which may be considered as the banks of the\r\nvallies which separate them, have also sinuosities in corresponding\r\nangles, it seems to demonstrate that the vallies have been formed, by\r\ndegrees, by the currents of the sea, in the same manner as the rivers\r\nhave hollowed out their beds on the earth.\r\n\r\nThe waters which run on the surface of the earth, and support its\r\nverdure and fertility, are not perhaps one half of those which the\r\nvapours produce; for there are many veins of water which sink to great\r\ndepths in the internal part of the earth. In some places we are certain\r\nto meet with water by digging; in others, not any can be found. In\r\nalmost all vallies and low grounds water is certain to be met with at\r\nmoderate depths; but, on the contrary, in all high places it cannot be\r\nextracted from the bowels of the earth, but must be collected from the\r\nheavens. There are countries of great extent where a spring cannot be\r\nfound, and where all the water which supplies the inhabitants and\r\nanimals with drink is contained in pools and cisterns. In the east,\r\nespecially in Arabia, Egypt, and Persia, wells are extremely scarce, and\r\nthe people have been obliged to make reservoirs of a considerable extent\r\nto collect the waters as it falls from the heavens. These works,\r\nprojected and executed from public necessity, are the most beautiful and\r\nmagnificent monuments of the eastern nations; some of the reservoirs\r\noccupy a space of two square miles, and serve to fertilize whole\r\nprovinces, by means of baths and small rivulets that let it out on every\r\nside. But in low countries, where the greatest rivers flow, we cannot\r\ndig far from the surface, without meeting with water, and in fields\r\nsituate in the environs of rivers it is often obtained by a few strokes\r\nwith a pick-axe.\r\n\r\nThe water, found in such quantities in low grounds, comes principally\r\nfrom the neighbouring hills and eminences; at the time of great rains or\r\nsudden melting of snow, a part of the water flows on the surface, but\r\nmost of it penetrates through the small cracks and crevices it finds in\r\nthe earth and rocks. This water springs up again to the surface wherever\r\nit can find vent; but it often filters through the sand until it comes\r\nto a bottom of clay or solid earth, where it forms subterraneous lakes,\r\nrivulets, and perhaps rivers, whose courses are entirely unknown; they\r\nmust, however, follow the general laws of nature, and constantly flow\r\nfrom the higher grounds to the lower, and consequently these\r\nsubterraneous waters must, in the end, fall into the sea, or collect in\r\nsome low place, either on the surface or in the interior part of the\r\nearth; for there are several lakes into which no rivers enter, nor from\r\nwhich there are not any issue; and a much greater number, which do not\r\nreceive any considerable river, that are the sources of the greatest\r\nrivers on earth; such as the lake of St. Laurence; the lake Chiamè,\r\nfrom whence spring two great rivers that water the kingdoms of Asam and\r\nPegu; the lake of Assiniboil in America; those of Ozera in Muscovy, that\r\ngive rise to the river Irtis, and a great number of others. These lakes,\r\nit is evident, must be produced by the waters from the high lands\r\npassing through subterraneous passages, and collecting in the lowest\r\nplaces. Some indeed have asserted that lakes are to be found on the\r\nsummit of the highest mountains; but to this no credit can be given, for\r\nthose found on the Alps, and other elevated places, are all surrounded\r\nby much more lofty mountains, and derive their origin from the waters\r\nwhich run down the sides, or are filtered through those eminences in the\r\nsame manner as the lakes in the plains obtain their sources from the\r\nneighbouring hills which overtop them.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent, therefore, that lakes have existence in the bowels of\r\nthe earth, especially under large plains and extensive vallies.\r\nMountains, hills, and all eminences have either a perpendicular or\r\ninclined situation, and are exposed on all sides; the waters which fall\r\non their summits, after having penetrated into the earth, cannot fail,\r\nfrom the declivity of the ground, of finding issue in many places, and\r\nbreaking in forms out of springs and fountains, and consequently there\r\nwill be little, if any water, remain in the mountains. On the contrary,\r\nin plains, as the water which filters through the earth can find no\r\nvent, it must collect in subterraneous caverns, or be dispersed and\r\ndivided among sand and gravel. It is these waters which are so\r\nuniversally diffused through low grounds. The bottom of a pit or well is\r\nnothing else but a kind of bason into which the waters that issue from\r\nthe adjoining lands insinuate themselves, at first falling drop by drop,\r\nbut afterwards, as the passages are opened, it receives supplies from\r\ngreater distances, and then continually runs in little streams or rills;\r\nfrom which circumstance, although we can find water in any part of a\r\nplain, yet we can obtain a supply but for a certain number of wells,\r\nproportionate to the quantity of water dispersed, or rather to the\r\nextent of the higher lands from whence they come.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to dig below the level of the river to find water; it\r\nis generally met with at much less depths, and there is no appearance\r\nthat waters of rivers filter far through the earth. The origin of waters\r\nfound in the earth below the level of rivers is not to be attributed to\r\nthem; for in rivers or torrents which are dried up, or whose courses\r\nhave been turned, we find no greater quantity of water by digging in\r\ntheir beds than in the neighbouring lands at an equal depth.\r\n\r\nA piece of land of five or six feet in thickness is sufficient to\r\ncontain water, and prevent it from escaping; and I have often observed\r\nthat the banks of brooks and pools are not sensibly wet at six inches\r\ndistance from the water.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the extent of the filtration is in proportion as the\r\nsoil is more or less penetrable; but if we examine the standing pools\r\nwith sandy bottoms, we shall perceive the water confined in the small\r\ncompass it had hollowed itself, and the moisture spread but a very few\r\ninches; even in vegetable earth it has no great extent, which must be\r\nmore porous than sand or hard soil. It is a certain fact, that in a\r\ngarden we may almost inundate one bed without those nearly adjoining\r\nfeeling any moisture from it[65:A]. I have examined pieces of garden\r\nground, eight or ten feet thick, which had not been stirred for many\r\nyears, and whose surface was nearly level, and found that the rain water\r\nnever penetrated deeper than three or four feet; and on turning it up in\r\nthe spring, after a wet winter, I found it as dry as when first heaped\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nI made the same observation on earth which had laid in ridges two\r\nhundred years; below three or four feet it was as dry as dust; from\r\nwhich it is plain that water does not extend so far by filtration as has\r\nbeen generally imagined.\r\n\r\nBy this means, therefore, the internal part of the earth can be supplied\r\nwith a very small part; but water by its own weight descends from the\r\nsurface to the greatest depths; it sinks through natural conduits, or\r\npenetrates small passages for itself; it follows the roots of trees, the\r\ncracks in rocks, the interstices in the earth, and divides and extends\r\non all sides into an infinity of small branches and rills, always\r\ndescending until its passage is opposed by clay or some solid body,\r\nwhere it continues collecting, and at length breaks out in form of\r\nsprings upon the surface.\r\n\r\nIt would be very difficult to make an exact calculation of the quantity\r\nof subterraneous waters which have no apparent vent. Many have pretended\r\nthat it greatly surpasses all the waters that are on the surface of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nWithout mentioning those who have advanced that the interior part of the\r\nglobe is entirely filled with water, there are some who believe there\r\nare an infinity of floods, rivulets, and lakes in the bowels of the\r\nearth. But this opinion does not seem to be properly founded, and it is\r\nmore probable that the quantity of subterraneous water, which never\r\nappears on the surface, is not very considerable; for if these\r\nsubterraneous rivers are so very numerous, why do we never see any of\r\ntheir mouths forcing their way through the surface? Besides, rivers, and\r\nall running waters, produce great alterations on the surface of the\r\nearth; they transport the soil, wear away the most solid rocks, and\r\ndisplace all matters which oppose their passage. It would certainly be\r\nthe same in subterraneous rivers; the same effects would be produced;\r\nbut no such alterations have ever as yet been observed; the different\r\nstrata remains parallel, and every where preserves its original\r\nposition; and it is but in a very few places that any considerable\r\nsubterraneous veins of water have been discovered. Thus water in the\r\ninternal part of the earth, though great, acts but in a small degree, as\r\nit is divided in an infinity of little streams, and retained by a number\r\nof obstacles; and being so generally dispersed, it gives rise to many\r\nsubstances totally different from primitive matters, both in form and\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nFrom all these observations we may fairly conclude, that it is the\r\ncontinual motion of the flux and reflux of the sea which has produced\r\nmountains, vallies, and other inequalities on the surface of the earth;\r\nthat it is the currents of the ocean which have hollowed vallies, raised\r\nhills, and given them corresponding directions; that it is those waters\r\nof the sea which, by transporting earth, &c. and depositing them in\r\nhorizontal layers, have formed the parallel strata; that it is the\r\nwaters from heaven, which by degrees destroy the effects of the sea, by\r\ncontinually lowering the summit of mountains, filling up vallies, and\r\nstopping the mouths of gulphs and rivers, and which, by bringing all to\r\na level, will, in the course of time, return this earth to the sea,\r\nwhich, by its natural operations, will again form new continents,\r\ncontaining vallies and mountains exactly similar to those which we at\r\npresent inhabit.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25:A] Particularly Scotland and Ireland.\r\n\r\n[65:A] These facts are so easily demonstrated, that the smallest\r\nobservation will prove their veracity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROOF\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\n_THE THEORY OF THE EARTH_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE I.\r\n\r\nON THE FORMATION OF THE PLANETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur subject being Natural History, we would willingly dispense with\r\nastronomical observations; but as the nature of the earth is so closely\r\nconnected with the heavenly bodies, and such observations being\r\ncalculated to illustrate more fully what has been said, it is necessary\r\nto give some general ideas of the formation, motion, figure of the earth\r\nand other planets.\r\n\r\nThe earth is a globe of about three thousand leagues diameter; it is\r\nsituate one thousand millions of leagues from the sun, around which it\r\nmakes its revolution in three hundred and sixty-five days. This\r\nrevolution is the result of two forces; the one may be considered as an\r\nimpulse from right to left, or from left to right, and the other an\r\nattraction from above downwards, or beneath upwards, to a common centre.\r\nThe direction of these two forces, and their quantities, are so nicely\r\ncombined and proportioned, that they produce an almost uniform motion in\r\nan ellipse, very near to a circle. Like the other planets the earth is\r\nopaque, it throws out a shadow; it receives and reflects the light of\r\nthe sun, round which it revolves in a space of time proportioned to its\r\nrelative distance and density. It also turns round its own axis once in\r\ntwenty-four hours, and its axis is inclined 66-1/4 degrees on the plane\r\nof the orbit. Its figure is spheroidical, the two axes of which differ\r\nabout 160th part from each other, and the smallest axis is that round\r\nwhich the revolution is made.\r\n\r\nThese are the principal phenomena of the earth, the result of\r\ndiscoveries made by means of geometry, astronomy, and navigation. We\r\nshall not here enter into the detail of the proofs and observations by\r\nwhich those facts have been ascertained, but only make a few remarks to\r\nclear up what is still doubtful, and at the same time give our ideas\r\nrespecting the formation of the planets, and the different changes thro'\r\nwhich it is possible they have passed before they arrived at the state\r\nwe at present see them.\r\n\r\nThere have been so many systems and hypotheses framed upon the formation\r\nof the terrestrial globe, and the changes which it has undergone, that\r\nwe may presume to add our conjectures to those who have written upon the\r\nsubject, especially as we mean to support them with a greater degree of\r\nprobability than has hitherto been done: and we are the more inclined to\r\ndeliver our opinion upon this subject, from the hope that we shall\r\nenable the reader to pronounce on the difference between an hypothesis\r\ndrawn from possibilities, and a theory founded in facts; between a\r\nsystem, such as we are here about to present, on the formation and\r\noriginal state of the earth, and a physical history of its real\r\ncondition, which has been given in the preceding discourse.\r\n\r\nGalileo having found the laws of falling bodies, and Kepler having\r\nobserved that the area described by the principal planets in moving\r\nround the sun, and those of the satellites round the planets to which\r\nthey belong, are proportionable to the time of their revolutions, and\r\nthat such periods were also in proportion to the square roots of the\r\ncubes of their distances from the sun, or principal planets. Newton\r\nfound that the force which caused heavy bodies to fall on the surface of\r\nthe earth, extended to the moon, and retained it in its orbit; that this\r\nforce diminished in the same proportion as the square of the distance\r\nincreased, and consequently that the moon is attracted by the earth;\r\nthat the earth and planets are attracted by the sun; and that in general\r\nall bodies which revolve round a centre, and describe areas proportioned\r\nto the times of their revolution, are attracted towards that point. This\r\npower, known by the name of GRAVITY, is therefore diffused throughout\r\nall matter; planets, comets, the sun, the earth, and all nature, is\r\nsubject to its laws, and it serves as a basis to the general harmony\r\nwhich reigns in the universe. Nothing is better proved in physics than\r\nthe actual existence of this power in every material substance.\r\nObservation has confirmed the effects of this power, and geometrical\r\ncalculations have determined the quantity and relations of it.\r\n\r\nThis general cause being known, the effects would easily be deduced from\r\nit, if the action of the powers which produce it were not too\r\ncomplicated. A single moment's reflection upon the solar system will\r\nfully demonstrate the difficulties that have attended this subject; the\r\nprincipal planets are attracted by the sun, and the sun by the planets;\r\nthe satellites are also attracted by their principal planets, and each\r\nplanet attracts all the rest, and is attracted by them. All these\r\nactions and reactions vary according to the quantities of matter and the\r\ndistances, and produce great inequalities and irregularities. How is so\r\ngreat a number of connections to be combined and estimated? It appears\r\nalmost impossible in such a crowd of objects to follow any particular\r\none; nevertheless those difficulties have been surmounted, and\r\ncalculation has confirmed the suppositions of them, each observation is\r\nbecome a new demonstration, and the systematic order of the universe is\r\nlaid open to the eyes of all those who can distinguish truth from error.\r\n\r\nWe feel some little stop, by the force of impulsion remaining unknown;\r\nbut this, however, does not by any means affect the general theory. We\r\nevidently see the force of attraction always draws the planets towards\r\nthe sun, they would fall in a perpendicular line, on that planet, if\r\nthey were not repelled by some other power that obliges them to move in\r\na straight line, and which impulsive force would compel them to fly off\r\nthe tangents of their respective orbits, if the force of attraction\r\nceased one moment. The force of impulsion was certainly communicated to\r\nthe planets by the hand of the Almighty, when he gave motion to the\r\nuniverse; but we ought as much as possible to abstain in physics from\r\nhaving recourse to supernatural causes; and it appears that a probable\r\nreason may be given for this impulsive force, perfectly accordant with\r\nthe law of mechanics, and not by any means more astonishing than the\r\nchanges and revolutions which may and must happen in the universe.\r\n\r\nThe sphere of the sun's attraction does not confine itself to the orbs\r\nof the planets, but extends to a remote distance, always decreasing in\r\nthe same ratio as the square of the distance increases; it is\r\ndemonstrated that the comets which are lost to our sight, in the regions\r\nof the sky, obey this power, and by it their motions, like that of the\r\nplanets, are regulated. All these stars, whose tracts are so different,\r\nmove round the sun, and describe areas proportioned to the time; the\r\nplanets in ellipses more or less approaching a circle, and the comets in\r\nnarrow ellipses of a great extent. Comets and planets move, therefore,\r\nby virtue of the force of attraction and impulsion, which continually\r\nacting at one time obliges them to describe these courses; but it must\r\nbe remarked that comets pass over the solar system in all directions,\r\nand that the inclinations of their orbits are very different, insomuch\r\nthat, although subject like the planets to the force of attraction, they\r\nhave nothing in common with respect to their progressive or impulsive\r\nmotions, but appear in this respect independent of each other: the\r\nplanets, on the contrary, move round the sun in the same direction, and\r\nalmost in the same plane, never exceeding 7-1/2 degrees of inclination\r\nin their planes, the most distant from their orbits. This conformity of\r\nposition and direction in the motion of the planets, necessarily implies\r\nthat their impulsive force has been communicated to them by one and the\r\nsame cause.\r\n\r\nMay it not be imagined, with some degree of probability, that a comet\r\nfalling into the body of the sun, will displace and separate some parts\r\nfrom the surface, and communicate to them a motion of impulsion,\r\ninsomuch that the planets may formerly have belonged to the body of the\r\nsun, and been detached therefrom by an impulsive force, and which they\r\nstill preserve.\r\n\r\nThis supposition appears to be at least as well founded as the opinion\r\nof Leibnitz, who supposes that the earth and planets had formerly been\r\nsuns; and his system, of which an account will be given in the fifth\r\narticle, would have been more comprehensive and more agreeable to\r\nprobability, if he had raised himself to this idea. We agree with him in\r\nthinking that this effect was produced at the time when Moses said that\r\nGod divided light from darkness; for, according to Leibnitz, light was\r\ndivided from darkness when the planets were extinguished; but in our\r\nsupposition there was a real physical separation, since the opaque\r\nbodies of the planets were divided from the luminous matter which\r\ncomposes the sun.\r\n\r\nThis idea of the cause of the impulsive force of the planets will be\r\nfound much less objectionable, when an estimation is made of the\r\nanalogies and degrees of probability, by which it may be supported. In\r\nthe first place, the motion of the planets are in the same direction,\r\nfrom West to East, and therefore, according to calculation, it is\r\nsixty-four to one that such would not have been the case, if they had\r\nnot been indebted to the same cause for their impulsive forces.\r\n\r\nThis, probably, will be considerably augmented by the second analogy,\r\nviz. that the inclination of the planes of the orbits do not exceed\r\n7-1/2 degrees; for, by comparing the spaces, we shall find there is\r\ntwenty-four to one, that two planets are found in their most distant\r\nplaces at the same time, and consequently ⁵, or 7,692,624 to one,\r\nthat all six would by chance be thus placed; or, what amounts to the\r\nsame, there is a great degree of probability that the planets have been\r\nimpressed with one common moving force, and which has given them this\r\nposition. But what can have bestowed this common impulsive motion, but\r\nthe force and direction of the bodies by which it was originally\r\ncommunicated? It may therefore be concluded, with great probability,\r\nthat the planets received their impulsive motion by one single stroke.\r\nThis likelihood, which is almost equivalent to a certainty, being\r\nestablished, I seek to know what moving bodies could produce this\r\neffect, and I find nothing but comets capable of communicating a motion\r\nto such vast bodies.\r\n\r\nBy examining the course of comets, we shall be easily persuaded, that it\r\nis almost necessary for some of them occasionally to fall into the sun.\r\nThat of 1680 approached so near, that at its perihelium it was not more\r\ndistant from the sun than a sixteenth part of its diameter, and if it\r\nreturns, as there is every appearance it will, in 2255, it may then\r\npossibly fall into the sun; that must depend on the rencounters it will\r\nmeet with in its road, and of the retardment it suffers in passing\r\nthrough the atmosphere of the sun[78:A].\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, presume with the great Newton, that comets sometimes\r\nfall into the sun; but this fall may be made in different directions. If\r\nthey fall perpendicular, or in a direction not very oblique, they will\r\nremain in the sun, and serve for food to the fire which that luminary\r\nconsumes, and the motion of impulsion which they will have communicated\r\nto the sun, will produce no other effect than that of removing it more\r\nor less, according as the mass of the comet will be more or less\r\nconsiderable; but if the fall of the comet is in a very oblique\r\ndirection, which will most frequently happen, then the comet will only\r\ngraze the surface of the sun, or slightly furrow it; and in this case it\r\nmay drive out some parts of matter to which it will communicate a common\r\nmotion of impulsion, and these parts so forced out of the body of the\r\nsun, and even the comet itself, may then become planets, and turn round\r\nthis luminary in the same direction, and in almost the same plane. We\r\nmight perhaps calculate what quantity of matter, velocity, and direction\r\na comet should have, to impel from the sun an equal quantity of matter\r\nto that which the six planets and their satellites contain; but it will\r\nbe sufficient to observe here, that all the planets, with their\r\nsatellites, do not make the 650th part of the mass of the sun,[79:A]\r\nbecause the density of the large planets, Saturn and Jupiter, is less\r\nthan that of the sun; and although the earth be four times, and the moon\r\nnear five times more dense than the sun, they are nevertheless but as\r\natoms in comparison with his extensive body.\r\n\r\nHowever inconsiderable the 650th part may be, yet it certainly at first\r\nappears to require a very powerful comet to separate even that much\r\nfrom the body of the sun; but if we reflect on the prodigious velocity\r\nof comets in their perihelion, a velocity so much the greater as they\r\napproach nearer the sun; if, besides, we pay attention to the density\r\nand solidity of the matter of which they must be composed, to suffer,\r\nwithout being destroyed, the inconceivable heat they endure; and\r\nconsider the bright and solid light which shines through their dark and\r\nimmense atmospheres, which surround, and must obscure them, it cannot be\r\ndoubted that the comets are composed of extremely solid and dense\r\nmatters, and that they contain a greater quantity of matter in a small\r\ncompass; that consequently a comet of no extraordinary bulk may have\r\nsufficient weight and velocity to displace the sun, and give a\r\nprojectile motion to a quantity of matter, equal to the 650th part of\r\nthe mass of this luminary. This perfectly agrees with what is known\r\nconcerning the density of planets, which always decreases as their\r\ndistance from the sun is increased, they having less heat to support; so\r\nthat Saturn is less dense than Jupiter, and Jupiter much less than the\r\nearth; therefore if the density of the planets be, as Newton asserts,\r\nproportionable to the quantity of heat which they have to support,\r\nMercury will be seven times more dense than the earth, and twenty-eight\r\ntimes denser than the sun; and the comet of 1680 would be 28,000 times\r\ndenser than the earth, or 112,000 times denser than the sun, and by\r\nsupposing it as large as the earth, it would contain nearly an equal\r\nquantity of matter to the ninth part of the sun, or by giving it only\r\nthe 100th part of the size of the earth, its mass would still be equal\r\nto the 900th part of the sun. From whence it is easy to conclude, that\r\nsuch a body, though it would be but a small comet, might separate and\r\ndrive off from the sun a 900th or a 650th part, particularly if we\r\nattend to the immense velocity with which comets move when they pass in\r\nthe vicinity of the sun.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the conformity between the density of the matter of the\r\nplanets, that of the sun deserves some attention. It is well known,\r\nthat, both on and near the surface of the earth, there are some matters\r\n14 or 1500 times denser than others. The densities of gold and air are\r\nnearly in this relation. But the internal parts of the earth and planets\r\nare composed of a more uniform matter, whose comparative density varies\r\nmuch less; and the conformity in the density of the planets and that of\r\nthe sun is such, that of 650 parts which compose the whole of the matter\r\nof the planets, there are more than 640 of the same density as the\r\nmatter of the sun, and only ten parts out of these 650 which are of a\r\ngreater density, for Saturn and Jupiter are nearly of the same density\r\nas the sun, and the quantity of matter which these planets contain, is\r\nat least 64 times greater than that of the four inferior planets, Mars,\r\nthe Earth, Venus, and Mercury. We must therefore admit, that the matter\r\nof which the planets are generally composed is nearly the same as that\r\nof the sun, and that consequently the one may have been separated from\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said, if the comet, by falling obliquely on the sun, drove\r\noff the matter which compose the planets, they, instead of describing\r\ncircles of which the sun is the centre, would, on the contrary, at each\r\nrevolution, have returned to the same point from whence they departed,\r\nas every projectile would which might be thrown off with sufficient\r\nforce from the surface of the earth, to oblige it to turn perpetually:\r\nfor it is easy to demonstrate that such, in that instance, would be the\r\ncase, and therefore that the projection of the planets from the sun\r\ncannot be attributed to the impulsion of a comet.\r\n\r\nTo this I reply, that the matter which composes the planets did not come\r\nfrom the sun, in ready formed globes, but in the form of torrents, the\r\nmotion of the anterior parts of which were accelerated by that of the\r\nposterior; and that the attraction of the anterior parts also\r\naccelerated the motion of the posterior, and that this acceleration\r\nproduced by one or other of these causes, or perhaps by both, might be\r\nso great as to change the original direction of the motion occasioned by\r\nthe impulse of the comet, from which cause a motion has resulted, such\r\nas we at present observe in the planets; especially when it is\r\nconsidered the sun is displaced from its station by the shock of the\r\ncomet. An example will render this more reasonable; let us suppose, that\r\nfrom the top of a mountain a musket ball is discharged, and that the\r\nstrength of the powder was sufficient to send it beyond the\r\nsemi-diameter of the earth, it is certain that this ball would pass\r\nround the earth, and at each revolution return to the spot from whence\r\nit had been discharged: but, if instead of a musket-ball, we suppose a\r\nrocket had been discharged, wherein the action of the fire being\r\ndurable, would greatly accelerate the motion of impulsion; this rocket,\r\nor rather the cartouch which contained it, would not return to the same\r\nplace like the musket-ball, but would describe an orbit, whose perigee\r\nwould be much farther distant from the earth, as the force of\r\nacceleration would be greater, and have changed the first direction.\r\n\r\nThus, provided there had been any acceleration in the motion of\r\nimpulsion communicated to the torrent of matter by the fall of the\r\ncomet, it is probable that the planets formed in this torrent, acquired\r\nthe motion which we know they have in the circles and ellipsis of which\r\nthe sun is the centre and focus.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the great eruptions of volcanos are made, may afford\r\nus an idea of this acceleration of motion. It has been remarked that\r\nwhen Vesuvius begins to roar and eject the inflamed matter it contains,\r\nthe first cloud has but a small degree of velocity, but which is soon\r\naccelerated by the impulse of the second; the second by the action of a\r\nthird, and so on, until the heavy mass of bitumen, sulphur, cinders,\r\nmelted metal, and huge stones, appear like massive clouds, and although\r\nthey succeed each other nearly in the same directions, yet they greatly\r\nchange that of the first, and drive it far beyond what it would have\r\nreached of itself.\r\n\r\nIn answer to this objection, it may be further observed, that the sun\r\nhaving been struck by the comet, received a degree of motion by the\r\nimpulse, which displaced it from its former situation; and that although\r\nthis motion of the sun is at present too little sensible for the notice\r\nof astronomers, nevertheless it may still exist, and the sun describe a\r\ncurve round the centre of gravity of the whole system and if this is so,\r\nas I presume it is, we see perfectly that the planets, instead of\r\nreturning near the sun at each revolution, will, on the contrary, have\r\ndescribed orbits, the points of the perihelion of which will be as far\r\ndistant from the sun, as it is itself from the place it originally\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\nIt may also be said, that if this acceleration of motion is made in the\r\nsame direction, no change in the perihelion will be produced: but can it\r\nbe thought that in a torrent, the particles of which succeed each other,\r\nthere has been no change of direction; it is, on the contrary, very\r\nprobable that a considerable change did take place, sufficient to cause\r\nthe planets to move in the course they at present occupy.\r\n\r\nIt may be further urged, that if the sun had been displaced by the shock\r\nof a comet, it would move uniformly, and that hence this motion being\r\ncommon to the whole system, no alteration was necessary; but might not\r\nthe sun before the shock have had a motion round the centre of the\r\ncometry system, to which primitive motion the stroke of the comet may\r\nhave added or diminished? and would not that fully account for the\r\nactual motion of the planets?\r\n\r\nIf these suppositions are not admitted, may it not be presumed, that in\r\nthe stroke of the comet against the sun, there was an elastic force\r\nwhich raised the torrent above the surface of the sun, instead of\r\ndirectly impelling it? which alone would be sufficient to remove the\r\nperihelion, and give the planets the motion they have retained. This\r\nsupposition is not without probability, for the matter of the sun may\r\npossibly be very elastic, since light, the only part of it we are\r\nacquainted with, seems, by its effects, to be perfectly so. I own that\r\nI cannot say whether it is by the one or the other of these reasons,\r\nthat the direction of the first motion of the impulse of the planets has\r\nchanged, but they suffice to shew that such an alteration is not only\r\npossible but even probable, and that is sufficient for my purpose.\r\n\r\nBut, without dwelling any longer on the objections which might be made,\r\nI shall pursue the subject, and draw the fair conclusions on the proofs\r\nwhich analogies might furnish in favour of my hypothesis: let us,\r\ntherefore, first see what might happen when these planets, and\r\nparticularly the earth, received their impulsive motion, and in what\r\nstate they were after having been separated from the sun. The comet\r\nhaving, by a single stroke, communicated a projectile motion to a\r\nquantity of matter equal to the 650th part of the sun's mass, the light\r\nparticles would of course separate from the dense, and form, by their\r\nmutual attraction, globes of different densities: Saturn being composed\r\nof the most gross and light parts, would be the most remote from the\r\nsun: Jupiter being more dense than Saturn, would be less distant, and so\r\non. The larger and least solid planets are the most remote, because\r\nthey received an impulsive motion stronger than the smallest, and more\r\ndense: for, the force of impulsion communicating itself according to the\r\nsurface, the same stroke would have moved the grosser and lighter parts\r\nof the matter of the sun with more velocity than the smallest and more\r\nweighty; a separation therefore will be made of the dense parts of\r\ndifferent degrees, so that the density of the sun being equal to 100,\r\nthat of Saturn will be equal to 67, that of Jupiter to 94-1/2, that of\r\nMars to 200, that of the Earth to 400, that of Venus to 800, and that of\r\nMercury to 2800. But the force of attraction not communicating like that\r\nof impulsion, according to the surface, but acting on the contrary on\r\nall parts of the mass, it will have checked the densest portions of\r\nmatter; and it is for this reason that the densest planets are the\r\nnighest the sun, and turn round that planet with greater rapidity than\r\nthe less dense planets, which are also the most remote.\r\n\r\nJupiter and Saturn, which are the largest and principal planets of the\r\nsolar system, have retained the relation between their density and\r\nimpulsive motions, in the most exact proportions; the density of Saturn\r\nis to that of Jupiter as 67 to 94-1/2 and their velocities are nearly\r\nas 88-2/3 to 120-1/72, or as 67 to 90-11/16; it is seldom that pure\r\nconjectures can draw such exact relations. It is true, that by following\r\nthis relation between the velocity and density of planets, the density\r\nof the earth ought to be only as 206-7/18, and not 400, which is its\r\nreal density; from hence it may be conceived, that our globe was\r\nformerly less dense than it is at present. With respect to the other\r\nplanets, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, as their densities are known only by\r\nconjecture, we cannot be certain whether this circumstance will destroy\r\nor confirm our hypothesis. The opinion of Newton is, that density is so\r\nmuch the greater, as the heat to which the planet is exposed is the\r\nstronger; and it is on this idea that we have just said that Mars is one\r\ntime less dense than the Earth, Venus one time, Mercury seven times, and\r\nthe comet in 1680, 28,000 times denser than the earth: but this\r\nproportion between the density of the planets and the heat which they\r\nsustain, seems not well founded, when we consider Saturn and Jupiter,\r\nwhich are the principal objects; for, according to this relation between\r\nthe density and heat, the density of Saturn would be about 4-7/18, and\r\nthat of Jupiter as 14-17/22, instead of 67 and 94-1/2, a difference too\r\ngreat to be admitted, and must destroy the principles upon which it was\r\nfounded. Thus, notwithstanding the confidence which the conjectures of\r\nNewton merit, I can but think that the density of the planets has more\r\nrelation with their velocity than with the degree of heat to which they\r\nare exposed. This is only a final cause, and the other a physical\r\nrelation, the preciseness of which is remarkable in Jupiter and Saturn:\r\nit is nevertheless true, that the density of the earth, instead of being\r\n206-7/8, is found to be 400, and that consequently the terrestrial globe\r\nmust be condensed in this ratio of 206-7/8 to 400.\r\n\r\nBut have not the condensations of the planets some relation with the\r\nquantity of the heat of the sun which they sustain? If so, Saturn, which\r\nis the most distant from that luminary, will have suffered little or no\r\ncondensation; and Jupiter will be condensed from 90-11/16 to 94-1/2. Now\r\nthe heat of the sun in Jupiter being to that of the sun upon the earth\r\nas 14-17/22 are to 400, the condensations ought to be in the same\r\nproportion. For instance, if Jupiter be condensed, as 90-11/16 to\r\n94-1/2, and the earth had been placed in his orbit, it would have been\r\ncondensed from 206-7/8 to 215-990/1451, but the earth being nearer the\r\nsun, and receiving a heat, whose relation to that which Jupiter receives\r\nis from 400 to 14-17/22, the quantity of condensation it would have\r\nexperienced on the orbit of Jupiter by the proportion of 400 to\r\n14-17/22, which gives nearly 234-1/3 for the quantity which the earth\r\nwould be condensed. Its density was 206-7/8, by adding the quantity of\r\nits acquired condensation, we find 400-7/8 for its actual density, which\r\nnearly approaches the real density 400, determined to be so by the\r\nparallax of the moon. As to other planets, I do not here pretend to give\r\nexact proportions, but only approximations, to point out that their\r\ndensities have a strong relation to their velocity in their respective\r\norbits.\r\n\r\nThe comet, therefore, by its oblique fall upon the surface of the sun,\r\nhaving driven therefrom a quantity of matter equal to the 650th part of\r\nits whole mass; this matter, which must be considered in a liquid state,\r\nwill at first have formed a torrent, the grosser and less dense parts of\r\nwhich will have been driven the farthest, and the smaller and more\r\ndense, having received only the like impulsion, will remain nearest its\r\nsource; the force of the sun's attraction would inevitably act upon all\r\nthe parts detached from him, and constrain them to circulate around his\r\nbody, and at the same time the mutual attraction of the particles of\r\nmatter would form themselves into globes at different distances from the\r\nsun, the nearest of which necessarily moving with greater rapidity in\r\ntheir orbits than those at a distance.\r\n\r\nBut another objection may be started, and it may be said, if the matter\r\nwhich composes the planets had been separated from the sun, they, like\r\nhim, would have been burning and luminous bodies, not cold and opaque,\r\nfor nothing resembles a globe of fire less than a globe of earth and\r\nwater; and by comparison, the matter of the earth and planets is\r\nperfectly different from that of the sun?\r\n\r\nTo this it may be answered, that in the separation the matter changed\r\nits form, and the light or fire was extinguished by the stroke which\r\ncaused this motion of impulsion. Besides, may it not be supposed that if\r\nthe sun, or a burning star, moved with such velocity as the planet, that\r\nthe fire would soon be extinguished; and that is the reason why all\r\nluminous stars are fixed, and that those stars which are called new, and\r\nwhich have probably changed places, are frequently extinguished and\r\nlost? This remark is somewhat confirmed by what has been observed in\r\ncomets; they must burn to the centre when they pass to their perihelium:\r\nnevertheless they do not become luminous themselves, they only exhale\r\nburning vapours, of which they leave a considerable part behind them in\r\ntheir course.\r\n\r\nI own, that in a medium where there is very little or no resistance,\r\nfire may subsist and suffer a very great motion without being\r\nextinguished: I also own, that what I have just said extends only to the\r\nstars which totally disappear, and not to those which have periodical\r\nreturns, and appear and disappear alternately without changing place in\r\nthe heavens. The phenomena of these stars has been explained in a very\r\nsatisfactory manner by M. de Maupertuis, in his discourse on the figures\r\nof the planets. But the stars which appear and afterwards disappear\r\nentirely, must certainly have been extinguished, either by the velocity\r\nof their motion, or some other cause. We have not a single example of\r\none luminous star revolving round another; and among the number of\r\nplanets which compose our system, and which move round the sun with\r\nmore or less rapidity, there is not one luminous of itself.\r\n\r\nIt may also be added, that fire cannot subsist so long in the small as\r\nin large masses, and that the planets must have burnt for some time\r\nafter they were separated from the sun, but were at length extinguished\r\nfor want of combustible matter, as probably would be the sun itself, and\r\nfor the same reason; but in a length of time as far beyond that which\r\nextinguished the planets, as it exceeds in quantity of matter. Be this\r\nas it may, the matter of which the planets are formed being separated\r\nfrom the sun, by the stroke of a comet, that appears a sufficient reason\r\nfor the extinction of their fires.\r\n\r\nThe earth and planets at the time of their quitting the sun, were in a\r\nstate of total liquid fire; in this state they remained only as long as\r\nthe violence of the heat which had produced it; and which heat\r\nnecessarily underwent a gradual decay: it was in this state of fluidity\r\nthat they took their circular forms, and that their regular motions\r\nraised the parts of their equators, and lowered their poles. This\r\nfigure, which agrees so perfectly with the laws of hydrostatics, I am of\r\nopinion with Leibnitz, necessarily supposes that the earth and planets\r\nhave been in a state of fluidity, caused by fire, and that the internal\r\npart of the earth must be a vitrifiable matter, of which sand, granite,\r\n&c. are the fragments and scoria.\r\n\r\nIt may, therefore, with some probability, be thought that the planets\r\nappertained to the sun, that they were separated by a single stroke,\r\nwhich gave to them a motion of impulsion, and that their position at\r\ndifferent distances from the sun proceeds only from their different\r\ndensities. It now only remains, to complete this theory, to explain the\r\ndiurnal motion of the planets, and the formation or the satellites; but\r\nthis, far from adding difficulties to my hypothesis, seems, on the\r\ncontrary, to confirm it.\r\n\r\nFor the diurnal motion, or rotation, depends solely on the obliquity of\r\nthe stroke, an oblique impulse therefore on the surface of a body will\r\nnecessarily give it a rotative motion; this motion will be equal and\r\nalways the same, if the body which receives it is homogeneous, and it\r\nwill be unequal if the body is composed of heterogeneous parts, or of\r\ndifferent densities; hence we may conclude that in all the planets the\r\nmatter is homogeneous, since their diurnal motions are equal, and\r\nregularly performed in the same period of time. Another proof that the\r\nseparation of the dense or less dense parts were originally from the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nBut the obliquity of the stroke might be such, as to separate from the\r\nbody of the principal planet a small part of matter, which would of\r\ncourse continue to move in the same direction; these parts would be\r\nunited, according to their densities, at different distances from the\r\nplanet, by the force of their mutual attraction, and at the same time\r\nfollow its course round the sun, by revolving about the body of the\r\nplanet, nearly in the plane of its orbit. It is plain, that those small\r\nparts so separated are the satellites: thus the formation, position, and\r\ndirection of the motions of the satellites perfectly agree with our\r\ntheory; for they have all the same motion in concentrical circles round\r\ntheir principal planet; their motion is in the same direction, and that\r\nnearly in the plane of their orbits. All these effects, which are common\r\nto them, and which depend on an impulsive force, can proceed only from\r\none common cause, which is, impulsive motion, communicated to them by\r\none and the same oblique stroke.\r\n\r\nWhat we have just said on the cause of the motion and formation of the\r\nsatellites, will acquire more probability, if we consider all the\r\ncircumstances of the phenomena. The planets which turn the swiftest on\r\ntheir axis, are those which have satellites. The earth turns quicker\r\nthan Mars in the relation of about 24 to 15; the earth has a satellite,\r\nbut Mars has none. Jupiter, whose rapidity round its axis is five to six\r\nhundred times greater than that of the earth, has four satellites, and\r\nthere is a great appearance that Saturn, which has five, and a ring,\r\nturns still more quickly than Jupiter.\r\n\r\nIt may even be conjectured with some foundation, that the ring of Saturn\r\nis parallel to the equator of the planet, so that the plane of the\r\nequator of the ring, and that of Saturn, are nearly the same; for by\r\nsupposing, according to the preceding theory, that the obliquity of the\r\nstroke by which Saturn has been set in motion was very great, the\r\nvelocity around the axis will, at first, have been in proportion as the\r\ncentrifugal force exceeds that of gravity, and there will be detached\r\nfrom its equator and neighbouring parts, a considerable quantity of\r\nmatter, which will necessarily have taken the figure of a ring, whose\r\nplane must be nearly the same as that of the equator of the planet; and\r\nthis quantity of matter having been detached from the vicinity of the\r\nequator of Saturn, must have lowered the equator of that planet, which\r\ncauses that, notwithstanding its rapidity, the diameters of Saturn\r\ncannot be so unequal as those of Jupiter, which differ from each other\r\nmore than an eleventh part.\r\n\r\nHowever great the probability of what I have advanced on the formation\r\nof the planets and their satellites may appear to me, yet, every man has\r\nhis particular measurement, to estimate probabilities of this nature;\r\nand as this measurement depends on the strength of the understanding to\r\ncombine more or less distant relations, I do not pretend to convince the\r\nincredulous. I have not only thought it my duty to offer these ideas,\r\nbecause they appear to me reasonable, and calculated to clear up a\r\nsubject, on which, however important, nothing has hitherto been written,\r\nbut because the impulsive motion in the planets enter at least as one\r\nhalf of the composition of the universe, which gravity alone cannot\r\nunfold. I shall only add the following questions to those who are\r\ninclined to deny the possibility of my system.\r\n\r\n1. Is it not natural to imagine, that a body in motion has received that\r\nmotion by the stroke of another body?\r\n\r\n2. Is it not very probable, that when many bodies move in the same\r\ndirection, that they have received this direction by one single stroke,\r\nor by many strokes directed in the same manner?\r\n\r\n3. Is it not more probable that when many bodies have the same direction\r\nin their motion, and are placed in the same plane, that they received\r\nthis direction and this position by one and the same stroke, rather than\r\nby a number?\r\n\r\n4. At the time a body is put in motion by the force of impulsion, is it\r\nnot probable that it receives it obliquely, and, consequently, is\r\nobliged to turn on its axis so much the quicker, as the obliquity of the\r\nstroke will have been greater? If these questions should not appear\r\nunreasonable, the theory, of which we have presented the outlines, will\r\ncease to appear an absurdity.\r\n\r\nLet us now pass on to something which more nearly concerns us, and\r\nexamine the figure of the earth, on which so many researches and such\r\ngreat observations have been made. The earth being, as it appears by the\r\nequality of its diurnal motion and the constancy of the inclination of\r\nits axis, composed of homogeneous parts, which attract each other in\r\nproportion to their quantity of matter, it would necessarily have taken\r\nthe figure of a globe perfectly spherical, if the motion of impulsation\r\nhad been given it in a perpendicular direction to the surface; but this\r\nstroke having been obliquely given, the earth turned on its axis at the\r\nmoment it took its form; and from the combination of this impulsive\r\nforce, the attraction of the parts, there has resulted a spheroid\r\nfigure, more elevated under the great circle of rotation, and lower at\r\nthe two extremities of the axis, and this because the action of the\r\ncentrifugal force proceeding from the diurnal rotation must diminish the\r\naction of gravity. Thus, the earth being homogeneous, and having\r\nreceived a rotative motion, necessarily took a spheroidical figure, the\r\ntwo axes of which differ a 230th part from each other. This may be\r\nclearly demonstrated, and does not depend on any hypothesis whatever.\r\nThe laws of gravity are perfectly known, and we cannot doubt that\r\nbodies attract each other in a direct ratio of their masses, and in an\r\ninverted ratio, at the squares of their distances; so likewise we cannot\r\ndoubt, that the general action of any body is not composed of all the\r\nparticular actions of its parts. Thus each part of matter mutually\r\nattracts in a direct ratio of its mass and an inverted ratio of its\r\ndistance, and from all these attractions there results a sphere when\r\nthere is no rotatory motion, and a spheroid when there is one. This\r\nspheroid is longer or shorter at the two extremities of the axis of\r\nrotation, in proportion to the velocity of its diurnal motion, and the\r\nearth has then, by virtue of its rotative velocity, and of the mutual\r\nattraction of all its parts, the figure of a spheroid, the two axes of\r\nwhich are as 229 to 230 to one another.\r\n\r\nThus, by its original constituent, by its homogeneousness, and\r\nindependent of every hypothesis from the direction of gravity, the earth\r\nhas taken this figure of a spheroid at its formation, and agreeable to\r\nmechanical laws: its equatorial diameter was raised about 6-1/2 leagues\r\nhigher than under the poles.\r\n\r\nI shall dwell on this article, because there are still geometricians who\r\nthink that the figure of the earth depends upon theory, and this from a\r\nsystem of philosophy they have embraced, and from a supposed direction\r\nof gravity. The first thing we have to demonstrate is, the mutual\r\nattraction of every part of matter, and the second the homogeneousness\r\nof the terrestrial globe; if we clearly prove, that these two\r\ncircumstances are really so, there will no longer be any hypothesis to\r\nbe made on the direction of gravity: the earth will necessarily have the\r\nfigure Newton decided in favour of, and every other figure given to it\r\nby virtue of vortexes or other hypotheses, will not be able to subsist.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted, that it is the force of gravity which retains the\r\nplanets in their orbits; the satellites of Saturn gravitate towards\r\nSaturn, those of Jupiter towards Jupiter, the Moon gravitates towards\r\nthe Earth: and Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Earth, Venus, and Mercury,\r\ngravitate towards the Sun: so likewise Saturn and Jupiter gravitate\r\ntowards their satellites, the Earth gravitates towards the Moon, and the\r\nSun towards the whole of the planets. Gravitation is therefore general\r\nand mutual in all the planetary system, for action cannot be exercised\r\nwithout a re-action; all the planets, therefore, act mutually one on the\r\nother. This mutual attraction serves as a foundation to the laws of\r\ntheir motion, and is demonstrated to exist by its effects. When Saturn\r\nand Jupiter are in conjunction, they act one on the other, and this\r\nattraction produces an irregularity in their motion round the Sun. It is\r\nthe same with the Earth and the Moon, they also mutually attract each\r\nother; but the irregularities of the motion of the Moon, proceeds from\r\nthe attraction of the Sun, so that the Earth, the Sun, and the Moon,\r\nmutually act one on the other. Now this mutual attraction of the\r\nplanets, when the distances are equal, is proportional to their quantity\r\nof matter, and the same force of gravity which causes heavy matter to\r\nfall on the surface of the Earth, and which extends to the Moon, is also\r\nproportional to the quantity of matter; therefore the total gravity of a\r\nplanet is composed of the gravity of each of its parts; from whence all\r\nthe parts of the matter, either in the Earth or in the planets, mutually\r\nattract each other and the Earth, by its rotation round its own axis,\r\nhas necessarily taken the figure of a spheroid, the axes of which are as\r\n229 to 230. The direction of the weight must be perpendicular to the\r\nEarth's surface; consequently no hypothesis, drawn from the direction of\r\ngravity, can be sustained, unless the general attraction of the parts of\r\nmatter be denied; but the existence of this mutual attraction is\r\ndemonstrated by observations, and the experiment of pendulums prove,\r\nthat its extension is general; therefore we cannot support an hypothesis\r\non the direction of gravity without going against experience and reason.\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed to examine whether the matter of which the\r\nterrestrial globe is composed be homogeneous. I admit, that if it is\r\nsupposed the globe is more dense in some parts than in others, the\r\ndirection of gravity must be different from what we have just assigned,\r\nand that the figure of the Earth would also differ agreeable to those\r\nsuppositions. But what reason have we to make these suppositions? Why,\r\nfor example, should we suppose that the parts near the centre are denser\r\nthan those which are more remote? Are not all the particles which\r\ncompose the globe collected together by their mutual attraction? hence,\r\neach particle is a centre, and there is no reason to believe, that the\r\nparts which surround the centre are denser than those which are about\r\nany other point. Besides, if one considerable part of the globe was\r\ndenser than another, the axis of rotation would be found near the dense\r\nparts, and an inequality would ensue in the diurnal revolution; we\r\nshould remark an inequality in the apparent motion of the fixed stars;\r\nthey would appear to move more quick or slow in the zenith, or horizon,\r\naccording as we should be placed on the denser or lighter parts of the\r\nearth; and the axis of the globe no longer passing through the centre of\r\ngravity, would also very sensibly change its position: but nothing like\r\nthis ever happens; on the contrary, the diurnal motion of the earth is\r\nequal and uniform. At all parts of the Earth's surface, the stars appear\r\nto move with the same velocity at all heights, and if there be any\r\nrotation in its axis, it is so trifling as to have escaped observation:\r\nit must therefore be concluded, that the globe is homogeneous, or nearly\r\nso in all its parts.\r\n\r\nIf the earth was a hollow and void globe, and the crust of which, for\r\nexample, not more than two or three miles thick; it would produce these\r\neffects. 1. The mountains would be such considerable parts of the whole\r\nthickness of the crust, that great irregularities in the motions of the\r\nEarth would be occasioned by the attraction of the Moon and Sun: for\r\nwhen the highest parts of the globe, as the Cordeliers, should have the\r\nMoon at noon, the attraction would be much stronger on the whole globe\r\nthan when she was in the meridian of the lowest parts. 2. The attraction\r\nof mountains would be much more considerable than it is in comparison\r\nwith the attraction of the whole globe, and experiments made at the\r\nmountain of Chimboraco, in Peru, would in this case give more degrees\r\nthan they have given seconds for the deviation of the plumb line. 3. The\r\nweight of bodies would be greater on the tops of high mountains than on\r\nthe planes; so that we should feel ourselves considerably heavier, and\r\nshould walk with more difficulty in high than in low places. These\r\nobservations, with many others that might be added, must convince us,\r\nthat the inner parts of the globe is not void, but filled with a dense\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if below the depth of two or three miles, the earth\r\nwas filled with a matter much more dense than any known, it would\r\nnecessarily occur, that every time we descended to moderate depths, we\r\nshould weigh much more, and the motion of pendulums would be more\r\naccelerated than in fact they are when carried from an eminence into a\r\nplain: thus, we may presume that the internal part of the Earth is\r\nfilled with a matter nearly similar to that which composes its surface.\r\nWhat may complete our determination in favour of this opinion is, that\r\nin the first formation of the globe, when it took its present\r\nspheroidical figure, the matter which composed it was in fusion, and,\r\nconsequently, all its parts were homogeneous, and nearly equally dense.\r\nFrom that time the matter on the surface, although originally the same\r\nwith the interior, has undergone a variety of changes by external\r\ncauses, which has produced materials of such different densities; but it\r\nmust be remarked, that the densest matters, as gold and metals, are also\r\nthose the most seldom to be met with, and consequently the greatest part\r\nof the matter at the surface of the globe has not undergone any very\r\ngreat changes with relation to its density; the most common materials,\r\nas sand and clay, differ very little, insomuch, that we may conjecture,\r\nwith great probability, that the internal part of the earth is composed\r\nof a vitrified matter, the density of which is nearly the same as that\r\nof sand, and that consequently the terrestrial globe in general may be\r\nregarded as homogeneous.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, it may be urged, that although the globe was\r\ncomposed of concentrical strata of different densities, the diurnal\r\nmotion might be equally certain, and the uniform inclination of the axis\r\nas constant and undisturbed as it could be, on the supposition of its\r\nbeing composed of homogeneous matter. I acknowledge it, but I ask at the\r\nsame time, if there is any reason to believe that strata of different\r\ndensities do exist? If these conclusions be not rather a desire to\r\nadjust the works of Nature to our own ideas? And whether in physics we\r\nought to admit suppositions which are not founded on observations or\r\nanalogy?\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that the earth, by virtue of the mutual\r\nattraction of its parts and its diurnal motion, assumed the figure of a\r\nspheroid; that it necessarily took that form from being in a state of\r\nfluidity; that, agreeable to the laws of gravity and of a centrifugal\r\nforce, it could have no other figure: that in the moment of its\r\nformation as at present, there was a difference between the two\r\ndiameters equal to a 230th part, and that, consequently, every\r\nhypothesis in which we find greater or less difference are fictions\r\nwhich merit no attention.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said, if this theory is true, and if 229 to 230 is the\r\njust relation of the axis, why did the mathematicians, sent to Lapland\r\nand Peru, agree to the relation of 174 to 175? From whence does this\r\ndifference arise between theory and practice? And is it not more\r\nreasonable to give the preference to practice and measures, especially\r\nwhen we have been taken by the most able mathematicians of\r\nEurope[109:A], and with all necessary apparatus to establish the result.\r\n\r\nTo this I answer, that I have paid attention to the observations made at\r\nthe equator and near the polar circle; that I have no doubt of their\r\nbeing exact, and that the earth may possibly be elevated an 175th part\r\nmore at the equator than at the poles. But, at the same time, I maintain\r\nmy theory, and I see clearly how the two conclusions may be reconciled.\r\nThis difference is about four leagues in the two axes, so that the parts\r\nat the equator are raised two leagues more than they ought to be,\r\naccording to my theory; this height answers exactly to the greatest\r\ninequalities on the surface of the globe, produced by the motion of the\r\nsea, and the action of the fluids. I will explain; it appears that when\r\nthe earth was formed, it must necessarily have taken, by virtue of the\r\nmutual attraction of its parts, and the action of the centrifugal force,\r\na spheroidical figure, the axes of which differ a 230th part: the\r\noriginal earth must have had this figure, which it took when it was\r\nfluid, or rather liquified by the fire; but after its formation the\r\nvapours which were extended and rarefied, as in the atmosphere and tail\r\nof a comet, became condensed, and fell on the surface in form of air and\r\nwater: and when these waters became agitated by the flux and reflux, the\r\nmatters were, by degrees, carried from the poles towards the equatorial\r\nparts; so that the poles were lowered about a league, and those of the\r\nequator raised in the same proportion; this was not suddenly done, but\r\nby degrees in succession of time; the earth being also exposed to the\r\naction of the winds, air, and sun; all these irregular causes concurred\r\nwith the flux and reflux to furrow its surface, hollow it into valleys,\r\nand raise it into mountains; and producing other inequalities and\r\nirregularities, of which, nevertheless, the greatest thickness does not\r\nexceed one league at the equator; this inequality of two leagues, is,\r\nperhaps, the greatest which can be on the surface of the earth, for the\r\nhighest mountains are scarce above one league in height, and there is\r\nmuch probability of the sea's not being more at its greatest depth. The\r\ntheory is therefore true, and practice may be so likewise; the earth at\r\nfirst could not be raised above 6-1/2 leagues more at the equator than\r\nthe poles, but the changes which have happened to its surface might\r\nafterwards raise it still more. Natural History wonderfully confirms\r\nthis opinion, for we have proved in the preceding discourse that the\r\nflux and reflux, and other motions of the water, have produced mountains\r\nand all the inequalities on the surface of the globe, that this surface\r\nhas undergone considerable changes, and that at the greatest depths, as\r\nwell as on the greatest heights, bones, shells and other wrecks of\r\nanimals, which inhabit the sea and earth, are met with.\r\n\r\nIt may be conjectured, from what has been said, that to find ancient\r\nearth, and matters which have never been removed from the spot in which\r\nthey were first placed, we must dig near the poles, where the bed of the\r\nearth must be thinner than in the Southern climates.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, if we strictly examine the measures by which the figure of\r\nthe earth is determined, we shall perceive this hypothesis enters into\r\nsuch determination; for it supposes the earth to have the figure of a\r\nregular curve, whereas from the constant changes the earth is\r\ncontinually undergoing from a variety and combination of causes, it is\r\nalmost impossible that it should have retained any regular figure, and\r\nhence the poles might, originally, only be flattened a 230th part, as\r\nNewton says, and as my theory requires. Besides, although we had exactly\r\nthe length of the degree at the polar circle and equator, have we not\r\nalso the length of the degree as exactly in France? And the measure of\r\nM. Picard, has it not been verified? Add to this that the augmentation\r\nand diminution in the motion of the pendulum, do not agree with the\r\nresult drawn from measurement, and that, on the contrary, they differ\r\nvery little from the theory of Newton. This is surely more than is\r\nrequisite to convince us that the poles are not flattened more than a\r\n230th part, and that if there is any difference, it can proceed only\r\nfrom the inequalities, which the water and other external causes have\r\nproduced on its surface; but these inequalities being more irregular\r\nthan regular, we must not form any hypothesis thereon, nor suppose, that\r\nthe meridians are ellipses, or any other regular curves. From whence we\r\nperceive, that if we should successively measure many degrees of the\r\nearth in all directions, we still should not be certain by that alone,\r\nof the exact situation of the poles, nor whether they were depressed\r\nmore or less than the 230th part.\r\n\r\nMay it not also be conjectured, that if the inclination of the axis of\r\nthe earth has changed, it can only be produced by the changes which have\r\nhappened to the surface, since all the rest of the globe is homogeneous;\r\nthat consequently this variation is too little sensible to be perceived\r\nby astronomers, and that if the earth is not encountered with a comet,\r\nor deranged, by any other external cause, its axis will remain\r\nperpetually inclined as it is at present, and as it has always been?\r\n\r\nIn order not to omit any conjecture which appears reasonable, may it not\r\nbe said, that as the mountains and inequalities which are on the\r\nsurface of the earth have been formed by the flux and reflux of the sea,\r\nthe mountains and inequalities which we remark on the surface of the\r\nmoon, have been produced by a similar cause? they certainly are much\r\nhigher than those of the earth, but then her tides are also much\r\nstronger, occasioned by the earth's being considerably larger than the\r\nmoon, and consequently producing her tides with a superior force; and\r\nthis effect would be much greater if the moon had, like the earth, a\r\nrapid rotation; but as the moon presents always the same surface to the\r\nearth, the tides cannot operate but in proportion to the motion arising\r\nfrom her libration, by which it alternatively discovers to us a segment\r\nof its other hemisphere; this, however, must produce a kind of flux and\r\nreflux, quite different from that of our sea, and the effects of which\r\nwill be much less considerable than if the moon had from its course a\r\nrevolution round its axis, as quick as the rotation of the terrestrial\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nI should furnish a volume as large as that of Burnet or Whiston's, if I\r\nwere to enlarge on the ideas which arise in support of the above; by\r\ngiving them a geometrical air, in imitation of the last author, I might\r\nadd considerably to their weight; but, in my opinion, hypothesis,\r\nhowever probable, ought not to be treated with such pomposity; it being\r\na dress which borders so much on quackery.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[78:A] Vide Newton, 2d edit. page 525.\r\n\r\n[79:A] Vid.

The common notion\r\nof the world being made in six days, he says is absolutely false, and\r\nthat the description given by Moses, is not an exact and philosophical\r\nnarration of the creation and origin of the universe, but only an\r\nhistorical representation of the terrestrial globe. The earth,\r\naccording to him, existed in the chaos; and, at the time mentioned by\r\nMoses, received the form, situation and consistency necessary to be\r\ninhabited by the human race. I shall not enter into a detail of his\r\nproofs, nor undertake their refutation. The exposition we have just\r\nmade, is sufficient to demonstrate the difference of his opinion with\r\npublic facts, its contrariety with scripture, and consequently the\r\ninsufficiency of his proofs. On the whole, he treats this matter as a\r\ntheological controvertist, rather than as an enlightened philosopher.\r\n\r\nLeaving these erroneous principles, he flies to ingenious suppositions,\r\nwhich, although extraordinary, yet have a degree of probability to those\r\nwho, like him, incline to the enthusiasm of system. He says, that the\r\nancient chaos, the origin of our earth, was the atmosphere of a comet:\r\nthat the annual motion of the earth began at the time it took its new\r\nform, but that its diurnal motion began only when the first man fell.\r\nThat the ecliptic cut the tropic of cancer, opposite to the terrestrial\r\nparadise, which was situated on the north-west side of the frontiers of\r\nAssyria: that before the deluge, the year began at the autumnal\r\nequinox: that the orbits of the planets, and the earth were then\r\nperfect circles. That the deluge began the 18th of November, 2365 of the\r\nJulian period, or 2349 years before Christ. That the solar and lunar\r\nyear were then the same, and that they exactly contained 360 days. That\r\na comet descending in the plane of the ecliptic towards its perihelion,\r\npassed near the globe of the earth the same day as the deluge began:\r\nthat there is a great heat in the internal part of the terrestrial\r\nglobe, which constantly diffuses itself from the centre to the\r\ncircumference; that the form of the earth is like that of an egg, the\r\nancient emblem of the globe; that mountains are the lightest part of the\r\nearth, &c. He afterwards attributes all the alterations and changes\r\nwhich have happened to the earth, to the universal deluge; then blindly\r\nadopts the theory of Woodward, and indiscriminately makes use of all the\r\nobservations of that author on the present state of the globe; but\r\nassumes originality when he speaks of its future state: according to him\r\nit will be consumed by fire, and its destruction will be preceded by\r\nterrible earthquakes, thunder, and frightful meteors; the Sun and Moon\r\nwill have an hideous aspect, the heavens will appear to fall, and the\r\nflames will be general over all the earth; but when the fire shall have\r\ndevoured all the impurities it contains; when it shall be vitrified and\r\nrendered transparent as crystal, the saints and the blessed spirits will\r\nreturn and take possession of it, and there remain till the day of\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThese hypotheses, at the first glance, appear to be rash and extravagant\r\nassertions; nevertheless the author has managed them with such address,\r\nand treated them with such strength, that they cease to appear\r\nabsolutely chimerical. He supports his subjects with much science, and\r\nit is surprising that, from a mixture of ideas so very absurd, a system\r\ncould be formed with an air of probability. It has not affected vulgar\r\nminds so much as it has dazzled the eyes of the learned, because they\r\nare more easily deceived by the glare of erudition, and the power of\r\nnovel ideas. Mr. Whiston was a celebrated astronomer, in the constant\r\nhabit of considering the heavens, observing the stars, and contemplating\r\nthe wonderful course of nature; he could never persuade himself that\r\nthis small grain of sand, this Earth which we inhabit, occupied more the\r\nattention of the Creator than the universe, the vast extent of which\r\ncontains millions of other Suns and Earths. He pretends, that Moses has\r\nnot given us the history of the first creation of this globe, but only a\r\ndetail of the new form that it took when the Almighty turned it from the\r\nmass of a comet into a planet, and formed it into a proper habitation\r\nfor men. Comets are, in fact, subjected to terrible vicissitudes by\r\nreason of the eccentricity of their orbits. Sometimes, like that in\r\n1680, it is a thousand times hotter there than red-hot iron; and\r\nsometimes a thousand times colder than ice; if they are, therefore,\r\ninhabited it must be by strange creatures, of which we can have no\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nThe planets, on the contrary, are places of rest, where the distance of\r\nthe sun not varying much, the temperature remains nearly the same, and\r\npermits different kinds of plants and animals to grow and multiply.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning God created the world; but, observes our author, the\r\nearth was then an uninhabitable comet, suffering alternatively the\r\nexcess of heat and cold, its liquifying and freezing by turns formed a\r\nchaos, or an abyss, surrounded with thick darkness: \"and darkness\r\ncovered the face of the deep,\" _& tenebræ erant superfaciam abissi_.\r\nThis chaos was the atmosphere of the comet, a body composed of\r\nheterogeneous matters, the centre occupied by spherical, solid, and hot\r\nsubstances, of about two thousand leagues in diameter, round which a\r\nvery great surface of a thick fluid extended, mixed with an unshapen and\r\nconfused matter, like the chaos of the ancient _rudis & indigestaque\r\nmoles_.\r\n\r\nThis vast atmosphere contained but very few dry, solid, or terrestrial\r\nparticles, still less aqueous or aerial, but a great quantity of fluid,\r\ndense and heavy matters, mixed, agitated and jumbled together in the\r\ngreatest disorder and confusion. Such was the earth before the six days,\r\nbut on the first day of the creation, when the eccentrical orbit of the\r\ncomet had been changed, every thing took its place, and bodies arranged\r\nthemselves according to the law of gravity, the heavy fluid descended to\r\nthe lowest places, and left the upper regions to the terrestrial,\r\naqueous and aerial parts; those likewise descended according to their\r\norder of gravity; first the earth, then the water, and last of all the\r\nair. The immense volume of chaos was thus reduced to a globe of a\r\nmoderate size, in the centre of which is the solid body that still\r\nretains the heat which the sun formerly communicated to it, when it\r\nbelonged to a comet. This heat may possibly endure six thousand years,\r\nsince the comet of 1680 required fifty thousand years to cool. Around\r\nthis solid and burning matter, which occupies the centre of the earth,\r\nthe dense and heavy fluid which descended the first is to be found, and\r\nthis is the fluid which forms the great abyss on which the earth is\r\nborne, like cork on quicksilver; but as the terrestrial parts were\r\noriginally mixed with a large quantity of water, in descending they have\r\ndragged with them a part of this water, which, not being able to\r\nre-ascend after the earth was consolidated, formed a concentrical bed\r\nwith the heavy fluid which surrounds this hot substance, insomuch that\r\nthe great abyss is composed of two concentrical orbs, the most internal\r\nof which is a heavy fluid, and the other water; the last of which serves\r\nfor a foundation to the earth. It is from this admirable arrangement,\r\nproduced by the atmosphere of a comet, that the Theory of the Earth, and\r\nthe explanation of all its phenomena are to depend.\r\n\r\nWhen the atmosphere of the comet was once disembarrassed from all the\r\nsolid and terrestrial matters, there remained only the lighter air,\r\nthrough which the rays of the sun freely passed and instantly produced\r\nlight: \"Let there be light, and there was light.\" The columns which\r\ncomposed the orb of the Earth being formed with such great precipitation\r\nis the cause of their different densities: consequently the heaviest\r\nsunk deeper into this subterraneous fluid than the lightest; and it is\r\nthis which has produced the vallies and mountains on the surface of the\r\nearth. These inequalities were, before the deluge, dispersed and\r\nsituated otherwise than they are at present. Instead of the vast valley,\r\nwhich contains the ocean, there were many small divided cavities on the\r\nsurface of the globe, each of which contained a part of this water; the\r\nmountains were also more divided, and did not form chains as at present:\r\nnevertheless, the earth contained a thousand times more people, and was\r\na thousand times more fertile; and the life of man and other animals\r\nwere ten times longer, all which was affected by the internal heat of\r\nthe earth that proceeded from the centre, and gave birth to a great\r\nnumber of plants and animals, bestowing on them a degree of vigour\r\nnecessary for them to subsist a long time, and multiply in great\r\nabundance. But this heat, by increasing the strength of bodies,\r\nunfortunately extended to the heads of men and animals; it augmented\r\ntheir passions; it deprived man of his innocence, and the brute creation\r\nof part of their intelligence; all creatures, excepting fish, who\r\ninhabited a colder element, felt the effects of this heat, became\r\ncriminal and merited death. It therefore came, and this universal death\r\nhappened on Wednesday the 28th of November, by a terrible deluge of\r\nforty days and forty nights, and was caused by the tail of another comet\r\nwhich encountered the earth in returning from its perihelion.\r\n\r\nThe tail of a comet is the lightest part of its atmosphere; it is a\r\ntransparent mist, a subtile vapour, which the heat of the sun exhales\r\nfrom the body of the comet: this vapour composed of extremely rarefied\r\naqueous and aerial particles, follows the comet when it descends to its\r\nperihelion, and precedes when it re-ascends, so that it is always\r\nsituate opposite to the sun, as if it sought to be in the shade, and\r\navoid the too great heat of that luminary. The column which this vapour\r\nforms is often of an immense length, and the more a comet approaches the\r\nsun, the longer and more extended is its tail, and as many comets\r\ndescend below the annual orb of the earth, it is not surprising that\r\nthe earth is sometimes found surrounded with the vapour of this tail;\r\nthis is precisely what happened at the time of the deluge. In two hours\r\nthe tail of a comet will evacuate a quantity of water equal to what is\r\ncontained in the whole ocean. In short, this tail was what Moses calls\r\nthe cataracts of Heaven, \"and the cataracts of Heaven were opened.\" The\r\nterrestrial globe meeting with the tail of a comet, must, in going its\r\ncourse through this vapour, appropriate to itself a part of the matter\r\nwhich it contains; all which, coming within the sphere of the earth's\r\nattraction, must fall on it, and fall in the form of rain, since this\r\ntail is partly composed of aqueous vapours. Thus rain may come down in\r\nsuch abundance as to produce an universal deluge the waters of which\r\nmight easily surmount the tops of the highest mountains. Nevertheless,\r\nour author, cautious of not going directly against the letter of holy\r\nwrit, does not say that this rain was the sole cause of the universal\r\ndeluge, but takes the water from every place he can find it. The great\r\nabyss as we see contains a considerable quantity. The earth, at the\r\napproach of the comet, would prove the force of its attraction; and the\r\nwaters contained in the great abyss would be agitated by so violent a\r\nkind of flux and reflux, that the superficial crust would not resist,\r\nbut split in several places, and the internal waters be dispersed over\r\nthe surface, \"And the fountains of the abyss were opened.\"\r\n\r\nBut what became of these waters, which the tail of the comet and great\r\nabyss furnished so liberally? our author is not the least embarrassed\r\nthereon. As soon as the earth, continuing its course, removed from the\r\ncomet, the effects of its attraction, the flux and reflux in the great\r\nabyss ceased of course, and immediately the upper waters precipitated\r\nback with violence by the same roads as they had been forced upon the\r\nsurface. The great abyss absorbed all the superfluous waters, and was of\r\na sufficient capacity not only to receive its own waters, but also all\r\nthose which the tail of the comet had left, because during its\r\nagitation, and the rupture of its crust, it had enlarged the space by\r\ndriving out on all sides the earth that surrounded it. It was at this\r\ntime also the figure of the earth, which till then was spherical, became\r\nelliptic. This effect was occasioned by the centrifugal force caused by\r\nits diurnal motion, and by the attraction of the comet, for the earth,\r\nin passing through the tail of the comet, found itself so placed that it\r\npresented the parts of the equator to that planet; and the power of the\r\nattraction of the comet, concurring with the centrifugal force of the\r\nearth, caused the parts of the equator to be elevated, and that with the\r\nmore facility as the crust was broken and divided in an infinity of\r\nplaces, and because the flux and reflux of the abyss drove against the\r\nequator more violently than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHere then is Mr. Whiston's history of the creation; the causes of the\r\nuniversal deluge; the length of the life of the first men; and the\r\nfigure of the Earth; all which seem to have cost our author little or no\r\nlabour; but Noah's ark appears to have greatly disquieted him. In the\r\nmidst of so terrible a disorder occasioned by the conjunction of the\r\ntail of a comet with the waters of the great abyss, in the terrible\r\nmoments wherein not only the elements of the earth were confused, but\r\nwhen new elements still concurred to augment the chaos, how can it be\r\nimagined that the ark floated quietly with its numerous cargo on the top\r\nof the waves? Here our author makes great efforts to arrive at and give\r\na physical reason for the preservation of the ark, but which has always\r\nappeared to me insufficient, poorly imagined, and but little\r\northodoxical: I will not here relate it, but only observe how hard it is\r\nfor a man who has explained objects so great and wonderful, without\r\nhaving recourse to a supernatural power, to be stopt by one particular\r\ncircumstance; our author, however, chose rather to risk drowning with\r\nthe ark, than to attribute to the immediate bounty of the Almighty the\r\npreservation of this precious vessel.\r\n\r\nI shall only make one remark on this system, of which I have made a\r\nfaithful abridgement: which is, whenever we are rash enough to attempt\r\nto explain theological truths by physical reasons, or interpret purely\r\nby human views, the divine text of holy writ, or that we endeavour to\r\nreason on the will of the Most High, and on the execution of his\r\ndecrees, we consequently shall involve ourselves in the darkness and\r\nchaos of obscurity and confusion, like the author of this system, which,\r\nin defiance of its absurdities, has been received with great applause.\r\nHe neither doubts the truth of the deluge, nor the authenticity of the\r\nsacred writ; but as he was less employed with it than with physic and\r\nastronomy, he has taken passages of the scripture for physical facts,\r\nand the results of astronomical observations; and has so strangely\r\nblended the divine knowledge with human science as to give birth to the\r\nmost extraordinary system that possibly ever was or will be conceived.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[115:A] A New Theory of the Earth by William Whiston, 1708.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE III.\r\n\r\nFROM THE SYSTEM OF BURNET.[128:A]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis author is the first who has treated this subject generally and in a\r\nsystematical matter. He was possessed of much understanding, and was a\r\nperson well acquainted with the _belles lettres_. His work acquired\r\ngreat reputation, and was criticised by many of the learned, among the\r\nrest by Mr. Keil, who has geometrically demonstrated the errors of Mr.\r\nBurnet, in a treatise called \"Examination of the Theory of the Earth.\"\r\nMr. Keil also refuted Whiston's system; but he treats the last author\r\nvery different from the first, and seems even to be of his opinion in\r\nseveral cases, and looks upon the tail of a comet to be a very probable\r\ncause for the deluge. But, to return to Burnet, his book is elegantly\r\nwritten; he knew how to paint noble images and magnificent scenes. His\r\nplan is great, but the execution is deficient for want of proper\r\nmaterials: his reasoning is good, but his proofs are weak; yet his\r\nconfidence in his writings is so great, that he frequently causes his\r\nreaders to pass over his errors.\r\n\r\nHe begins by telling us, that before the deluge the earth had a very\r\ndifferent form from that which it has at present; it was at first, he\r\nsays, a fluid mass, compounded of matters of all kinds, and all sorts of\r\nfigures, the heaviest descended towards the centre, and formed a hard\r\nand solid body; round which the waters collected, and the air, and all\r\nthe liquors lighter than water, surmounted them. Between the orb of air\r\nand that of water, was an orb of oily matter, but as the air was still\r\nvery impure, and contained a great quantity of small particles of\r\nterrestrial matter, they by degrees descended on the coat of oil, and\r\nformed a terrestrial orb blended with earth and oil; and this was the\r\nfirst habitable earth, and the first abode of man. This was an excellent\r\nsoil, light, and calculated to yield to the tenderness of the first\r\ngerms. The surface of the terrestrial globe was at first equal, uniform,\r\nwithout mountains, without seas, and without inequalities; but it\r\nremained only about sixteen centuries in this state, for the heat of the\r\nsun by degrees drying the crust, split it at first on the surface, soon\r\nafter these cracks penetrated farther and increased so considerably by\r\ntime, that at length they entirely opened the crust; in an instant the\r\nwhole earth fell into pieces in the abyss of water it surrounded; and\r\nthis was the cause of the deluge.\r\n\r\nBut all these masses of earth, by falling into the abyss, dragged along\r\nwith them a great quantity of air; these struck against each other,\r\ndivided, and accumulated so irregularly, that great cavities filled with\r\nair were left between them. The waters by degrees opened these cavities,\r\nand in proportion as they filled them, the surface of the earth\r\ndiscovered itself in the highest parts; at length water alone remained\r\nin the lowest parts; that is to say, the vast vallies which contain the\r\nsea. Thus our ocean is a part of the ancient abyss, the rest is entered\r\ninto the internal cavities with which the ocean communicates. The\r\nislands and sea rocks are the small fragments, and continents are the\r\ngreat masses of the old crust. As the rupture and the fall of this crust\r\nare made of a sudden, and with confusion, it was not surprising to find\r\neminences, depths, plains, and inequalities of all kinds on the surface\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[128:A] Thomas Burnet. Telluris theoria sacra, orbis nostri originem &\r\nmutationes generales, quas aut jam subut, aut olim Subiturus est\r\ncomplectens. Londina, 1681.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE IV.\r\n\r\nFROM THE SYSTEM OF WOODWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be said of this author, that he attempted to raise an immense\r\nmonument on a less solid base than the moving sand, and to construct a\r\nworld with dust; for he pretends, that at the time of the deluge a total\r\ndissolution of the earth was made. The first idea which presents, after\r\nhaving gone through his book,[132:A] is, that this dissolution was made\r\nby the waters of the great abyss. He asserts, that the abyss where the\r\nwater was included opened all at once at the command of God, and\r\ndispersed over the surface an enormous quantity of water necessary to\r\ncover the tops of the highest mountains, and that God suspended the\r\ncause of cohesion which reduced all solid bodies into dust, &c. He did\r\nnot consider that by these suppositions he added other miracles to that\r\nof the universal deluge, or at least physical impossibilities, which\r\nagree neither with the letter of the holy writ, nor with the\r\nmathematical principles of natural philosophy. But as this author has\r\nthe merit of having collected many important observations, and as he was\r\nbetter acquainted with the materials of which the globe is composed than\r\nthose who preceded him, his system, although badly conceived, and worse\r\ndigested, has nevertheless dazzled many people, who, seduced by the\r\ntruth of some particular circumstances, put confidence in his general\r\nconclusions; we shall, therefore, give a short view of his theory, in\r\nwhich, by doing justice to the author's merit, and the exactness of his\r\nobservations, we shall put the reader in a state of judging of the\r\ninsufficiency of his system, and of the falsity of some of his remarks.\r\nMr. Woodward speaks of having discovered by his sight that all matters\r\nwhich compose the English earth, from the surface to the deepest places\r\nwhich had been dug, were disposed by beds of strata, and that in a great\r\nnumber of these there were shells and other marine productions; he\r\nafterwards adds, that by his correspondents and friends he was assured,\r\nthat in other countries the earth is composed of the same materials, and\r\nthat shells are found there, not only in the plains but on the highest\r\nmountains, in the deepest quarries, and in an infinity of different\r\nplaces. He perceived their strata to be horizontal and disposed one over\r\nthe other, as matters are which are transported by the waters, and\r\ndeposited in form of sediment. These general remarks, which are true,\r\nare followed by particular observations, by which he evidently shews,\r\nthat fossils found incorporated in the strata are real shells and marine\r\nproductions, not minerals and singular bodies, the sport of nature, &c.\r\n\r\nTo these observations, though partly made before him, which he has\r\ncollected and proved, he adds others less exact. He asserts, that all\r\nmatters of different strata are placed one on the other in the order of\r\ntheir specific gravity.\r\n\r\nThis general assertion is not true, for we daily see rocks placed above\r\nclay, sand, coal, and bitumen, and which certainly are specifically\r\nheavier than either of these latter materials. If, in fact, we found\r\nthroughout the earth that the first strata was bitumen, then chalk, then\r\nmarl, clay, sand, stone, marble, and at last metals, so that the\r\ncomposition of the earth exactly followed the law of gravity, there\r\nwould be an appearance that they might have been precipitated at the\r\nsame time, which our author asserts with confidence, in spite of the\r\nevidence to the contrary; for, without being a naturalist, we need only\r\nhave our eye-sight to be convinced that heavy strata are often found\r\nabove lighter, and that consequently these sediments were not\r\nprecipitated all at one time, but have been brought and deposited\r\nsuccessively by the water. As this is the foundation of his system, and\r\nis manifestly false, we shall follow it no farther than to show how far\r\nan erroneous principle may produce false combinations and erroneous\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nAll the matters, says our author, which compose the earth, from the\r\nsummits of the highest mountains, to the greatest depths of mines, are\r\ndisposed by strata, according to their specific weights; therefore he\r\nconcludes the whole has been dissolved and precipitated at one time. But\r\nin what manner, and at what time was it dissolved? In water, replies he,\r\nand at the time of the deluge. But there is not a sufficient quantity of\r\nwater on the globe for this to be effected, since there is more land\r\nthan water, and the bottom of the sea itself is earth. This he admits,\r\nbut says, there is more water than is requisite at the centre of the\r\nearth, that it was only necessary for it to ascend, and possess a power\r\nof dissolving every substance but shells, afterwards to find the means\r\nfor this water to re-enter the abyss, and to make all this agree with\r\nthe history of the deluge. This then is the system, of which the author\r\ndoes not entertain the least doubt; for when it is opposed to him that\r\nwater cannot dissolve marble, stone, and metals, especially in forty\r\ndays, the duration of the deluge, he answers simply, that nevertheless\r\nit did happen so. When he is asked, what the virtue of this water of\r\nthe abyss was, to dissolve all the earth, and at the same time preserve\r\nthe shells? he says, that he never pretended that this water was a\r\ndissolvent; but that it is clear, by facts, that the earth has been\r\ndissolved and the shells preserved. When he was evidently shown that if\r\nhe had no reason to give, or facts to support, for these phenomena, his\r\nsystem was useless, he said, we have only to imagine that, during the\r\ndeluge, the force of gravity and the coherency of matter ceased on a\r\nsudden, and by this supposition the dissolution of the old world would\r\nbe explained in a very easy and satisfactory manner. But, it was said to\r\nhim, if the power which holds the parts of matter united was suspended,\r\nwhy were not the shells dissolved as well as all the rest? Here he makes\r\na discourse on the organization of shells and bones of animals, by which\r\nhe pretends to prove that their texture being fibrous, and different\r\nfrom that of minerals, their power of cohesion was different also; after\r\nall, we have, says he, only to suppose that the power of gravity and\r\ncohesion did not entirely cease, but that it was only diminished\r\nsufficient to disunite all the parts of minerals, and not those of\r\nanimals. To all this we cannot be prevented from discovering, that our\r\nauthor's philosophy was not equal to his talents for observation; and I\r\ndo not think it necessary seriously to refute opinions which have no\r\nfoundation, especially when they have been imagined against the rules of\r\nprobability, and drawn from consequences contrary to mechanical laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[132:A] An Essay towards the Natural History of the Earth, &c. by John\r\nWoodward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE V.\r\n\r\nEXPOSITION OF SOME OTHER SYSTEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the three forementioned hypotheses have much in common\r\nwith each other. They all agree in this point, that during the deluge\r\nthe earth changed its form, as well externally as internally; but these\r\nspeculators have not considered that the earth before the deluge was\r\ninhabited by the same species of men and animals, and must necessarily\r\nhave been nearly such as it is at present. The sacred writings teach us,\r\nthat before the deluge there were rivers, seas, mountains, and forests.\r\nThat these rivers and mountains were, for the most part, retained in the\r\nsame situations; the Tigris and Euphrates were the rivers of the ancient\r\nparadise; that the mountain of Armenia, on which the ark rested, was one\r\nof the highest mountains in the world at the deluge, as it is at\r\npresent: that the same plants and animals which exist now, existed then;\r\nfor we read of the serpent, of the raven, of the crow, and of the dove,\r\nwhich brought the olive branch into the ark. Although Tournefort asserts\r\nthere are no olive trees for more than 400 miles from Mount Ararat, and\r\npasses some absurd jokes thereon[138:A], it is nevertheless certain\r\nthere were olives in this neighbourhood at the time of the deluge, since\r\nholy writ assures us of it in the most express terms; but it is by no\r\nmeans astonishing that in the space of 4000 years the olive trees should\r\nhave been destroyed in those quarters, and multiplied in others; it is\r\ntherefore contrary to scripture and reason, that those authors have\r\nsupposed the earth was quite different from its present state before the\r\ndeluge; and this contradiction between their hypothesis and the sacred\r\ntext, as well as physical truths, must cause their systems to be\r\nrejected, if even they should agree with some phenomena. Burnet gives\r\nneither observations, nor any real facts, for the support of his system.\r\nWoodward has only given us an essay, in which he promised much more than\r\nhe could perform: his book is a project, the execution of which has not\r\nbeen seen. He has made use of two general observations; the first, that\r\nthe earth is every where composed of matters which formerly were in a\r\nstate of fluidity, transported by the waters, and deposited in\r\nhorizontal strata. The second, that there are abundance of marine\r\nproductions in most parts of the bowels of the earth. To give a reason\r\nfor these facts, he has recourse to the universal deluge, or rather it\r\nappears that he gives them as proofs of the deluge; but, like Burnet, he\r\nfalls into evident contradictions, for it is not to be supposed with\r\nthem that there were no mountains prior to the deluge, since it is\r\nexpressly stated, that the waters rose fifteen cubits above the tops of\r\nthe highest mountains. On the other hand, it is not said that these\r\nwaters destroyed or dissolved these mountains; but, on the contrary,\r\nthese mountains remained in their places, and the ark rested on that\r\nwhich the water first deserted. Besides how can it be imagined that,\r\nduring the short duration of the deluge, the waters were able to\r\ndissolve the mountains and the whole body of the earth? Is it not an\r\nabsurdity to suppose that in forty days all marble, rocks, stones, and\r\nminerals, were dissolved by water? Is it not a manifest contradiction to\r\nadmit this total dissolution, and at the same time maintain that shells,\r\nbones, and marine productions were preserved entire, and resisted that\r\nwhich had dissolved the most solid substances? I shall not therefore\r\nhesitate to say, that Woodward, with excellent facts and observations,\r\nhas formed but a poor and inconsistent system.\r\n\r\nWhiston, who came last, greatly enriched the other two, and\r\nnotwithstanding he gave a vast scope to his imagination has not fallen\r\ninto contradiction; he speaks of matters not very credible, but they are\r\nneither absolutely nor evidently impossible. As we are ignorant of the\r\ncentre of the earth, he thought he might suppose it was a solid matter,\r\nsurrounded with a ring of heavy fluid, and afterwards with a ring of\r\nwater, on which the external crust was sustained; in the latter the\r\ndifferent parts of this crust were more or less sunk, in proportion to\r\ntheir relative weights, which produced mountains and inequalities on the\r\nsurface of the earth. Here, however, this astronomer has committed a\r\nmechanical blunder; he did not recollect that the earth, according to\r\nthis hypothesis, must be an uniform arch, and that consequently it could\r\nnot be borne on the water it contains, and much less sunk therein. I do\r\nnot know that there are any other physical errors; but he has made a\r\ngreat number of errors, both in metaphysics and theology. On the whole\r\nit cannot be denied absolutely that the earth meeting with the tail of a\r\ncomet might not be inundated, especially allowing the author that the\r\ntail of a comet may contain aqueous vapours; nor can it be denied as an\r\nabsolute impossibility that the tail of a comet, in returning from its\r\nperihelium, might not burn the earth, if we suppose, with Mr. Whiston,\r\nthat the comet passed very near the sun; it is the same with the rest of\r\nthe system. But though his ideas are not absolutely impossibilities,\r\nthere is so little probability to each thing, when taken separately,\r\nthat the result upon the whole taken together puts it beyond\r\ncredibility.\r\n\r\nThe three systems we have spoken of are not the only works which have\r\nbeen composed on the theory of the earth; a Memoir of M. Bourguet\r\nappeared in 1729, printed at Amsterdam, with his \"Philosophical Letters\r\non the Formation of Salts, &c.\" in which he gives a specimen of the\r\nsystem he meditated, but which was prevented completion by the death of\r\nthe author. It is but justice to admit, that no person was more\r\nindustrious in making observations or collecting facts. To him we owe\r\nthat great and beautiful observation, the correspondence between the\r\nangles of mountains. He presents every thing which he had collected in\r\ngreat order; but with all those advantages, it appears that he has\r\nsucceeded no better than the rest in making a physical and reasonable\r\nhistory of the changes which had happened to the globe, and that he was\r\nvery wide from having found the real cause of those effects which he\r\nrelates. To be convinced of this we need only cast our eyes on the\r\npropositions which he deduces from the phenomena, and which ought to\r\nserve for the basis of his theory. He says, that the whole globe took\r\nits form at one time, and not successively; that its form and\r\ndisposition prove that it has been in a state of fluidity; that the\r\npresent state of the earth is very different from that in which it was\r\nfor many ages after its first formation; that the matter of the globe\r\nwas at the beginning less dense than since it altered its appearance;\r\nthat the condensation of its solid parts diminished by degrees with its\r\nvelocity, so that after having made a number of revolutions on its axis,\r\nand round the sun, it found itself on a sudden in a state of\r\ndissolution, which destroyed its first structure. This happened about\r\nthe vernal equinox. That the sea-shells introduced themselves into the\r\ndissolved matters; that after this dissolution the earth took the form\r\nit now has, and that the fire which directly infused itself therein\r\nconsumed it by degrees, and it will be one day destroyed by a terrible\r\nexplosion, accompanied with a general conflagration, which will augment\r\nthe atmosphere of the globe, and diminish its diameter, and that then\r\nthe earth, instead of beds of sand or earth, will have only strata of\r\ncalcined metal and mountains composed of amalgamas of different metals.\r\n\r\nThis is sufficient to shew the system M. Bourguet meditated; to divine\r\nin this manner the past, and predict the future, nearly as others have\r\npredicted, does not appear to me to be an effort of judgment: this\r\nauthor had more erudition than sound and general views: he appears to be\r\ndeficient in that capaciousness of ideas necessary to follow the extent\r\nof the subject, and enable him to comprehend the chain of causes and\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nIn the acts of Leipsic, the famous Leibnitz published a scheme of quite\r\na different system, under the title of _Protogaea_. The earth, according\r\nto Bourguet and others, must end by fire; according to Leibnitz it began\r\nby it, and has suffered many more changes and revolutions than is\r\nimagined. The greatest part of the terrestrial matter was surrounded by\r\nviolent flames at the time when Moses says light was divided from\r\ndarkness. The planets, as well as the earth, were fixed stars, luminous\r\nof themselves. After having burnt a long time, he pretends that they\r\nwere extinguished for want of combustible matter, and are become opaque\r\nbodies. The fire, by melting the matter, produced a vitrified crust,\r\nand the basis of all the matter which composes the globe is glass, of\r\nwhich sand and gravel are only fragments. The other kinds of earth are\r\nformed from a mixture of this sand, with fixed salts and water, and when\r\nthe crust cooled, the humid particles, which were raised in form of\r\nvapours, refel, and formed the sea. They at first covered the whole\r\nsurface, and even surmounted the highest mountains. According to this\r\nauthor, the shells, and other wrecks of the sea, which are every where\r\nto be found, positively prove that the sea has covered the whole earth;\r\nand the great quantity of fixed salts, sand, and other melted and\r\ncalcined matters, which are included in the bowels of the earth, prove\r\nthat the conflagration had been general, and that it preceded the\r\nexistence of the sea. Although these thoughts are void of proofs, they\r\nare capital. The ideas have connection, the hypotheses are not\r\nimpossible, and the consequences that may be drawn therefrom are not\r\ncontradictory: but the grand defect of this theory is, that it is not\r\napplicable to the present state of the earth; it is the past which it\r\nexplains, and this past is so far back, and has left us so few remains,\r\nthat we may say what we please of it, and the probability will be in\r\nproportion as a man has talents to elucidate what he asserts. To affirm\r\nas Whiston has done, that the earth was originally a comet, or, with\r\nLeibnitz, that it has been a sun, is saying things equally possible or\r\nimpossible, and to which it would be ridiculous to apply the rules of\r\nprobability. To say that the sea formerly covered all the earth, that it\r\nsurrounded the whole globe, and that it is for this reason shells are\r\nevery where found, is not paying attention to a very essential point,\r\nthe unity of the time of the creation; for if that was so, it must\r\nnecessarily be admitted, that shell-fish, and other inhabitants of the\r\nsea, of which we find the remains in the internal part of the earth,\r\nexisted long before man, and all terrestrial animals. Now, independent\r\nof the testimony of holy writ, is it not reasonable to think, that all\r\nanimals and vegetables are nearly as ancient as each other?\r\n\r\nM. Scheutzer, in a Dissertation, addressed to the Academy of Sciences in\r\n1728, attributes, like Woodward, the change, or rather the second\r\nformation of the globe, to the universal deluge; to explain that of\r\nmountains, he says, that after the deluge, God chusing to return the\r\nwaters into subterraneous reservoirs, broke and displaced with his\r\nall-powerful hand a number of beds, before horizontal, and raised them\r\nabove the surface of the globe, which was originally level. The whole\r\nDissertation is composed to imply this opinion. As it was requisite\r\nthese eminences should be of a solid consistence, M. Scheutzer remarks,\r\nthat God only drew them from places where there were many stones; from\r\nhence, says he, it proceeds that those countries, like Switzerland,\r\nwhich are very stony, are also mountainous; and on the contrary, those,\r\nas Holland, Flanders, Hungary and Poland, have only sand or clay, even\r\nto a very great depth, and are almost entirely without mountains.[147:A]\r\n\r\nThis author, more than any other, is desirous of blending Physic with\r\nTheology, and though he has given some good observations, the\r\nsystematical part of his works is still weaker than those who preceded\r\nhim. On this subject he has even made declamations and ridiculous\r\nwitticisms, as may be seen in his _Visciam quærelæ_, &c. without\r\nspeaking of his large work in many folio volumes, _Physica Sacra_, a\r\npuerile work, which appears to be composed less for the instruction of\r\nmen than for the amusement of children.\r\n\r\nSteno, and some others, have attributed the cause of the inequalities of\r\nthe earth to particular inundations, earthquakes, &c. but the effects of\r\nthese secondary causes have been only able to produce some slight\r\nchanges. We admit of these causes after the first cause, the motion of\r\nthe flux and reflux, and of the sea from east to west. Neither Steno,\r\nnor the rest, have given theory, nor even any general facts on this\r\nmatter.[148:A]\r\n\r\nRay pretends that all mountains have been produced by earthquakes, and\r\nhe has composed a treatise to prove it; we shall shew under the article\r\nof Volcanos what little foundation his opinion is built upon.\r\n\r\nWe cannot dispense with observing that Burnet, Woodward, Whiston, and\r\nmost of these other authors, have committed an error which deserves to\r\nbe cleared up; which is, to have looked upon the deluge as possible by\r\nthe action of natural causes, whereas scripture presents it to us as\r\nproduced by the immediate will of God; there is no natural cause which\r\ncan produce on the whole surface of the earth, the quantity of water\r\nrequired to cover the highest mountains; and if even we could imagine a\r\ncause proportionate to this effect, it would still be impossible to find\r\nanother cause capable of causing the water to disappear: allowing\r\nWhiston, that these waters proceeded from the tail of a comet, we deny\r\nthat any could proceed from the great abyss, or that they all returned\r\ninto it, since the great abyss, according to him, being surrounded on\r\nevery side by the crust, or terrestrial orb, it is impossible that the\r\nattraction of the comet could cause any motion to the fluids it\r\ncontained; much less, as he says, a violent flux and reflux; hence there\r\ncould not be issued from, nor entered into, the great abyss, a single\r\ndrop of water; and unless it is supposed that the waters which fell from\r\nthe comet have been destroyed by a miracle, they would still be on the\r\nsurface of the earth, covering the summits of the highest mountains.\r\nNothing better characterises a miracle, than the impossibility of\r\nexplaining the effect of it by natural causes. Our authors have made\r\nvain efforts to give a reason for the deluge; their physical efforts,\r\nand the secondary causes, which they made use of, prove the truth of the\r\nfact as reported in the scriptures, and demonstrate that it could only\r\nhave been performed by the first cause, the will of the Almighty.\r\n\r\nBesides, it is certain that it was neither at one time, nor by the\r\neffect of the deluge, that the sea left dry these continents we inhabit:\r\nfor it is certain by the testimony of holy writ, that the terrestrial\r\nparadise was in Asia, and that Asia was inhabited before the deluge;\r\nconsequently the sea, at that time, did not cover this considerable part\r\nof the globe. The earth, before the deluge, was nearly as it is at\r\npresent, and this enormous quantity of water, which divine justice\r\ncaused to fall on the earth to punish guilty men, in fact, brought death\r\non every creature; but it produced no change on the surface of the\r\nearth, it did not even destroy plants which grew upon it, since the dove\r\nbrought an olive branch to the ark in her beak.\r\n\r\nWhy, therefore, imagine, as many of our naturalists have done, that this\r\nwater totally changed the surface of the globe even to a depth of two\r\nthousand feet? Why do they desire it to be the deluge which has brought\r\nthe shells on the earth which we meet with at 7 or 800 feet depth in\r\nrocks and marble? Why say, that the hills and mountains were formed at\r\nthat time? And how can we figure to ourselves, that it is possible for\r\nthese waters to have brought masses and banks of shells 100 miles long?\r\nI see not how they can persist in this opinion, at least, without\r\nadmitting a double miracle in the deluge; the first, for the\r\naugmentation of the waters; and the second, for the transportation of\r\nthe shells; but as there is only the first which is related in the\r\nBible, I do not see it necessary to make the second an article of our\r\ncreed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the waters of the deluge had retired all at once,\r\nthey would have carried so great a quantity of mud and other impurities,\r\nthat the Earth would not have been capable of culture till many ages\r\nafter this inundation; as is known, by the deluge which happened in\r\nGreece, where the overflowed country was totally forsaken, and could not\r\nreceive any cultivation for more than three centuries.[151:A] We ought\r\nalso to look on the universal deluge as a supernatural means of which\r\nthe Almighty made use for the chastisement of mankind, and not as an\r\neffect of a natural cause. The universal deluge is a miracle both in its\r\ncause and effects; we see clearly by the scripture that it was designed\r\nfor the destruction of men and animals, and that it did not in any mode\r\nchange the earth, since after the retreat of the waters, the mountains,\r\nand even the trees, were in their places, and the surface of the earth\r\nwas proper to receive culture and produce vines and fruits. How could\r\nall the race of fish, which did not enter the ark, be preserved, if the\r\nearth had been dissolved in the water, or only if the waters had been\r\nsufficiently agitated to transport shells from India to Europe, &c.?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this supposition, that it was the deluge which transported\r\nthe shells of the sea into every climate, is the opinion, or rather the\r\nsuperstition, of naturalists. Woodward, Scheutzer, and some more, call\r\nthese petrified shells the remains of the deluge; they look on them as\r\nthe medals and monuments which God has left us of this terrible event,\r\nin order that it never should be effaced from the human race. In short,\r\nthey have adopted this hypothesis with so much enthusiasm, that they\r\nappear only desirous to reconcile holy scripture with their opinion; and\r\ninstead of making use of their observations, and deriving light\r\ntherefrom, they envelope themselves in the clouds of a physical\r\ntheology, the obscurity of which is derogatory to the simplicity and\r\ndignity of religion, and only leaves the absurd to perceive a ridiculous\r\nmixture of human ideas and divine truths. To pretend to explain the\r\nuniversal Deluge, and its physical causes; to attempt to teach what\r\npassed in the time of that great revolution; to divine what were the\r\neffects of it; to add facts to those of Holy Writ, to draw consequences\r\nfrom such facts, is only a presumptuous attempt to measure the power of\r\nthe Most High. The natural wonders which his benevolent hand performs in\r\nan uniform and regular manner, are incomprehensible; and by the\r\nstrongest reason, these wonderful operations and miracles ought to hold\r\nus in awful wonder, and in silent adoration.\r\n\r\nBut they will say, the universal Deluge being a certain fact, is it not\r\npermitted to reason on its consequences? It may be so; but it is\r\nrequisite that you should begin by allowing that the Deluge could not be\r\nperformed by physical causes; you ought to consider it is an immediate\r\neffect of the will of the Almighty; you ought to confine yourselves to\r\nknow only what the Holy Writ teaches, and particularly not to blend bad\r\nphilosophy with the purity of divine truth. These precautions, which the\r\nrespect we owe to the Almighty exacts, being taken, what remains for\r\nexamination on the subject of the Deluge? Does the Scripture say\r\nmountains were formed by the Deluge? No, it says the contrary. Is it\r\nsaid that the agitation of the waters was so great as to raise up shells\r\nfrom the bottom of the sea, and transport them all over the earth? No;\r\nthe ark floated quietly on the surface of the waters. Is it said, that\r\nthe earth suffered a total dissolution? None at all: the recital of the\r\nsacred historian is simple and true, that of these naturalists complex\r\nand fabulous.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[138:A] Voyage du Levant, vol. 2, page 336.\r\n\r\n[147:A] See the Hist. of the Acad. 1708, page 32.\r\n\r\n[148:A] See the Diss. de Solido intra Solidum, &c.\r\n\r\n[151:A] See Acta erudit, Lepiss, Ann. 1691, page 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE VI.\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe surface of the Earth, like that of Jupiter, is not divided by bands\r\nalternative and parallel to the equator; on the contrary, it is divided\r\nfrom one pole to the other, by two bands of earth, and two of sea; the\r\nfirst and principal is the ancient continent, the greatest length of\r\nwhich is found to be in a line, beginning on the east point of the\r\nnorthern part of Tartary, and extending from thence to the land which\r\nborders on the gulph of Linchidolkin, where the Muscovites fish for\r\nwhales; from thence to Tobolski, from Tobolski to the Caspian sea, from\r\nthe Caspian sea to Mecca, and from Mecca to the western part of the\r\ncountry inhabited by the Galli, in Africa; afterwards to Monoemuci or\r\nMonomotapa, and at last to the Cape of Good Hope; this line, which is\r\nthe greatest length of the old continent, is about 3600 leagues, Paris\r\nmeasure; it is only interrupted by the Caspian and Red seas, the\r\nbreadths of which are not very considerable, and we must not pay any\r\nregard to these interruptions, when it is considered, the surface of the\r\nglobe is divided only in four parts.\r\n\r\nThis greatest length is found by measuring the old continent diagonally;\r\nfor if measured according to the meridians, we shall find that there are\r\nonly 2500 leagues from the northernmost Cape of Lapland to the Cape of\r\nGood Hope; and that the Baltic and Mediterranean cause a much greater\r\ninterruption than is met with in the other way. With respect to all the\r\nother distances that might be measured in the old continent under the\r\nsame meridian, we shall find them to be much smaller than this; having,\r\nfor example, only 1800 leagues from the most southern point of the\r\nisland of Ceylon to the northernmost coast of Nova Zembla. Likewise, if\r\nwe measure the continent parallel to the equator, we find that the\r\ngreatest uninterrupted length is found from Trefna, on the western coast\r\nof Africa, to Ninpo, on the eastern coast of China, and that it is about\r\n2800 leagues. Another course may be measured from the point of Brittany\r\nnear Brest, extending to the Chinese Tartary; about 2300 leagues. From\r\nBergen, in Norway, to the coast of Kamschatka, is no more than 1800\r\nleagues. All these lines have much less length than the first, therefore\r\nthe greatest extent of the old continent, is, in fact, from the eastern\r\npoint of Tartary to the Cape of Good Hope, that is about 3600 leagues.\r\n\r\nThere is so great an equality of surface on each side of this line,\r\nwhich is also the longest, that there is every probability to suppose it\r\nreally divides the contents of the ancient continent; for in measuring\r\non one side is found 2,471,092-3/4 square leagues, and on the other\r\n2,469,687.\r\n\r\nAgreeable to this, the old continent consists of about 4,940,780 square\r\nleagues, which is nearly one-fifth of the whole surface of the globe,\r\nand has an inclination towards the equator of about 30 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe greatest length of the new continent may be taken in a line from the\r\nmouth of the river Plata to the lake of Assiniboils. From the former it\r\npasses to the lake Caracara; from thence to Mataguais, Pocona, Zongo,\r\nMariana, Morua, St. Fe, and Carthagena; it then proceeds through the\r\ngulph of Mexico, Jamaica, and Cuba, passes along the peninsula of\r\nFlorida, through Apolache, Chicachas, and from thence to St. Louis, Fort\r\nle Suer, and ends on the borders of lake Assiniboils; the whole extent\r\nof which is still unknown.\r\n\r\nThis line, which is interrupted only by the Mexican gulph (which must be\r\nlooked upon as a mediterranean sea) may be about 2500 leagues long, and\r\ndivides the new continent into nearly two equal parts, the left of which\r\ncontains about 1,069,286-5/6 leagues square, and that on the right about\r\n1,070,926-1/12; this line, which forms the middle of the band of the new\r\ncontinent, is inclined to the equator about 30 degrees, but in an\r\nopposite direction, for that of the old continent extends from the\r\nnorth-east to the south-west, and that of the new continent from the\r\nnorth-west to the south-east. All those lands together of the old and\r\nnew continent, make about 7,080,993 leagues square, which is not near\r\nthe third of the whole surface, which contains 25 millions of square\r\nleagues.\r\n\r\nIt must be remarked, that these two lines, which divide the continents\r\ninto two equal parts, both terminate at the same degree of southern and\r\nnorthern latitude, and that the two continents make opposite\r\nprojections, which exactly face each other; to wit, the coasts of\r\nAfrica, from the Canary islands to the coasts of Guinea, and those of\r\nAmerica from Guiana to the mouth of Rio Janeiro.\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that the most ancient land of the globe, is on\r\nthe two sides of these lines, at the distance of from 2 to 250 leagues\r\non each side. By following this idea, which is founded on the\r\nobservations before related, we shall find in the old continent that the\r\nmost ancient lands of Africa are those which extend from the Cape of\r\nGood Hope to the Red Sea, as far as Egypt, about 500 leagues broad, and\r\nthat, consequently, all the western coasts of Africa, from Guinea to the\r\nstraits of Gibraltar, are the newest lands. So likewise we shall\r\ndiscover that in Asia, if we follow the line on the same breadth, the\r\nmost ancient lands are Arabia Felix and Deserta, Persia, Georgia,\r\nTurcomania, part of Tartary, Circassia, part of Muscovy, &c. that\r\nconsequently Europe, and perhaps also China, and the eastern part of\r\nTartary, are more modern. In the new continent we shall find the Terra\r\nMagellanica, the eastern part of Brasil, the country of the Amazons,\r\nGuiana, and Canada, to be the new lands, in comparison with Peru, Terra\r\nFirma, the islands in the gulph of Mexico, Florida, the Mississippi, and\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nTo these observations we may add two very remarkable facts, the old and\r\nnew continent are almost opposite each other; the old is more extensive\r\nto the north of the equator than the south; the new is more to the south\r\nthan the north. The centre of the old continent is in the 16th or 18th\r\ndegree of north latitude, and the centre of the new is in the 16th or\r\n18th degree south latitude, so that they seem to be made to\r\ncounterbalance each other. There is also a singular connexion between\r\nthe two continents, although it appears to be more accidental than those\r\nwhich I have spoken of, which is, that if the two continents were\r\ndivided into two parts, all four would be surrounded by the sea, if it\r\nwere not for the two small isthmuses, Suez and Panama.\r\n\r\nThis is the most general idea which an attentive inspection of the globe\r\nfurnishes us with, on the division of the earth. We shall abstain from\r\nforming hypotheses thereon, and hazarding reasonings which might lead\r\ninto false conclusions; but no one as yet having considered the\r\ndivision of the globe under this point of view, I shall submit a few\r\nremarks. It is very singular that the line which forms the greatest\r\nlength of the terrestrial continents divides them also into two equal\r\nparts; it is no less so that these two lines commence and end at the\r\nsame degrees of latitude, and are both alike inclined to the equator.\r\nThese relations may belong to some general conclusions, but of which we\r\nare ignorant. The inequalities in the figure of the two continents we\r\nshall hereafter examine more fully: it is sufficient here to observe,\r\nthat the most ancient countries are the nearest to these lines, and are\r\nthe highest; that the more modern lands are the farthest, and also the\r\nlowest. Thus in America, the country of the Amazons, Guiana and Canada\r\nwill be the most modern parts; by casting our eyes on the map of this\r\ncountry we see the waters on every side, and that they are divided by\r\nnumberless lakes and rivers, which also indicates that these lands are\r\nof a late formation; while on the other hand Peru and Mexico are high\r\nmountains, and situate at no great distance from the line that divides\r\nthe continent, which are circumstances that seem to prove their\r\nantiquity. Africa is very mountainous, and that part of the world is\r\nalso very ancient. There are only Egypt, Barbary, and the western coasts\r\nof Africa, as far as Senegal, in this part of the globe, which can be\r\nlooked upon as modern countries. Asia is an old land, and perhaps the\r\nmost ancient of all, particularly Arabia, Persia, and Tartary; but the\r\ninequalities of this vast part of the globe, as well as those of Europe,\r\nwe will consider in a separate article. It might be said in general,\r\nthat Europe is a new country, and such position would be supported both\r\nby the universal traditions relative to the emigrations of different\r\npeople, and the origin of arts and sciences. It is not long since it was\r\nfilled with morasses, and covered with forests, whereas in the land\r\nanciently inhabited, there are but few woods, little water, no morasses,\r\nmuch land, and a number of mountains, whose summits are dry and barren;\r\nfor men destroy the woods, drain the waters, confine rivers, dry up\r\nmorasses, and in time give a different appearance to the face of the\r\nearth, from that, of uninhabited or newly-peopled countries.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were acquainted with but a small part of the globe. All\r\nAmerica, the Magellanic, and a great part of the interior of Africa,\r\nwas entirely unknown to them. They knew not that the torrid zone was\r\ninhabited, although they had navigated around Africa, for it is 2200\r\nyears since Neco, king of Egypt, gave vessels to the Phenicians, who\r\nsailed along the Red Sea, coasted round Africa, doubled the Cape of Good\r\nHope, and having employed two years in this voyage, the third year they\r\nentered the straits of Gibraltar.[163:A] The ancients were unacquainted\r\nwith the property of the loadstone, if turned towards the poles,\r\nalthough they knew that it attracted iron. They were ignorant of the\r\ngeneral cause of the flux and reflux of the sea, nor were they certain\r\nthe ocean surrounded the globe; some indeed suspected it might be so,\r\nbut with so little foundation, that no one dared to say, or even\r\nconjecture, it was possible to make a voyage round the world. Magellan\r\nwas the first who attempted it in the year 1519, and accomplished the\r\ngreat voyage in 1124 days. Sir Francis Drake was the second in 1577, and\r\nhe performed it in 1056 days; afterwards Thomas Cavendish made this\r\ngreat voyage in 777 days, in the year 1586. These celebrated navigators\r\nwere the first who demonstrated physically the sphericity and the\r\nextent of the earth's circumference; for the ancients had no conception\r\nof the extent of this circumference, although they had travelled a great\r\ndeal. The trade winds, so useful in long voyages, were also unknown to\r\nthem; therefore we must not be surprised at the little progress they\r\nmade in geography. Notwithstanding the knowledge we have acquired by the\r\naid of mathematical sciences, and the discovery of navigators, many\r\nthings remain still unsettled, and vast countries undiscovered. Almost\r\nall the land on the side of the Atlantic pole is unknown to us; we only\r\nknow that there is some, and that it is separated from all the other\r\ncontinents by the ocean. Much land also remains to be discovered on the\r\nside of the Arctic pole, and it is to be regretted that for more than a\r\ncentury the ardour of discovering new countries is extremely abated.\r\nEuropean governments seem to prefer, and possibly with reason,\r\nincreasing the value of those countries we are acquainted with to the\r\nglory of conquering new ones.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the discovery of the southern continent would be a great\r\nobject of curiosity, and might be useful. We have discovered only some\r\nfew of its coasts; those navigators who have attempted this discovery,\r\nhave always been stopt by the ice. The thick fogs, which are in those\r\nlatitudes, is another obstacle; yet, in defiance of these\r\ninconveniencies, it is probable that by sailing from the Cape of Good\r\nHope at different seasons, we might at last discover a part of these\r\nlands, which hitherto make a separate world.\r\n\r\nThere is another method, which possibly might succeed better. The ice\r\nand fogs having hitherto prevented the discovery, might it not be\r\nattempted by the Pacific Sea; sailing from Baldivia, or any other port\r\non the coast of Chili, and traversing this sea under the 50th degree\r\nsouth latitude? There is not the least appearance that this navigation\r\nis perilous, and it is probable would be attended with the discovery of\r\nnew countries; for what remains for us to know on the coast of the\r\nsouthern pole, is so considerable, that we may estimate it at a fourth\r\npart of the globe, and of course may contain a continent, as large as\r\nEurope, Asia, and Africa, all together.\r\n\r\nAs we are not at all acquainted with this part of the globe, we cannot\r\njustly know the proportion between the surface of the earth and that of\r\nthe sea; only as much as may be judged by inspection of what is known,\r\nthere is more sea than land.\r\n\r\nIf we would have an idea of the enormous quantity of water which the sea\r\ncontains, we must suppose a medium depth, and by computing it only at\r\n200 fathom, or the sixth part of a league, we shall find that there is\r\nsufficient to cover the whole globe to the height of 600 feet of water,\r\nand if we would reduce this water into one mass, it would form a globe\r\nof more than 60 miles diameter.\r\n\r\nNavigators pretend, that the latitudes near the south pole are much\r\ncolder than those of the north, but there is no appearance that this\r\nopinion is founded on truth, and probably has been adopted, because ice\r\nis found in latitudes where it is scarcely ever seen in the southern\r\nseas; but that may proceed from some particular cause. We find no ice in\r\nApril on this side 67 and 68 degrees northern latitude: and the savages\r\nof Arcadia and Canada say, when it is not all melted in that month, it\r\nis a sign the rest of the year will be cold and rainy. In 1725 there may\r\nbe said to have been no summer, it rained almost continually; and the\r\nice of the northern sea was not only not melted in April in the 67th\r\ndegree, but even it was found the 15th of June towards the 41st and 42d\r\ndegree[167:A].\r\n\r\nA great quantity of floating ice appears in the northern sea, especially\r\nat some distance from land. It comes from the Tartarian sea into that of\r\nNova Zembla, and other parts of the Frozen Ocean. I have been assured by\r\npeople of credit, that an English Captain, named Monson, instead of\r\nseeking a passage between the northern land to go to China, directed his\r\ncourse strait to the pole, and had approached it within two degrees;\r\nthat in this course he had found an open sea, without any ice, which\r\nproves that the ice is formed near land, and never in open sea; for if\r\nwe should suppose, against all probability, that it might be cold enough\r\nat the pole to freeze over the surface of the sea, it is still not\r\nconceivable how these enormous floating mountains of ice could be\r\nformed, if they did not find a fixed point against land, from whence\r\nafterwards they were loosened by the heat of the sun. The two vessels\r\nwhich the East India Company sent, in 1739, to discover land in the\r\nSouth Seas, found ice in the latitude of 47 and 48 degrees, but this\r\nice was not far from shore, that being in sight although they were\r\nunable to land. This must have been separated from the adjoining lands\r\nof the south pole, and it may be conjectured that they follow the course\r\nof some great rivers, which water the unknown land, the same as the Oby,\r\nJenisca, and other great floods, which fall into the North Seas, carry\r\nwith them the ice, which, during the greatest part of the year, stops up\r\nthe straits of Waigat, and renders the Tartarian sea unnavigable by this\r\ncourse; whereas beyond Nova Zembla, and nearer the poles, where there\r\nare few rivers, and but little land, ice is not so frequently met with,\r\nand the sea is more navigable; so that if they would still attempt the\r\nvoyage to China and Japan by the North Seas, we should possibly, to keep\r\nclear from the land and ice, shape our course to the pole, and seek the\r\nopen seas, where certainly there is but little or no ice; for it is\r\nknown that salt water can, without freezing, become colder than fresh\r\nwater when frozen, and consequently the excessive cold of the pole may\r\npossibly render the sea colder than the ice, without the surface being\r\nfrozen: so much the more as at 80 or 82 degrees, the surface of the\r\nsea, although mixed with much snow and fresh water, is only frozen near\r\nthe shore. By collecting the testimonies of travellers, on the passage\r\nfrom Europe to China, it appears that one does exist by the north sea;\r\nand the reason it has been so often attempted in vain is, because they\r\nhave always feared to go sufficiently far from land, and approach the\r\npole.\r\n\r\nCaptain William Barents, who, as well as others, run aground in his\r\nvoyage, yet did not doubt but there was a passage, and that if he had\r\ngone farther from shore, he should have found an open sea free from ice.\r\nThe Russian navigators, sent by the Czar to survey the north seas,\r\nrelate that Nova Zembla is not an island, but belonging to the continent\r\nof Tartary, and that to the north of it is a free and open sea. A Dutch\r\nnavigator asserts, that the sea throws up whales on the coasts of Corea\r\nand Japan, which have English and Dutch harpoons on their backs. Another\r\nDutchman has pretended to have been at the pole, and asserts it is as\r\nwarm there as it is at Amsterdam in the middle of the summer. An\r\nEnglishman, named Golding, who made more than thirty voyages to\r\nGreenland, related to King Charles II. that two Dutch vessels with which\r\nhe had sailed, having found no whales on the coast of the island of\r\nEdges, resolved to proceed farther north, and that upon their return at\r\nthe expiration of fifteen days, they told him that they had been as far\r\nas 89 degrees latitude (within one degree of the pole), and that they\r\nfound no ice there, but an open deep sea like that of the Bay of Biscay,\r\nand that they shewed him the journals of the two vessels, as a proof of\r\nwhat they affirmed. In short, it is related in the Philosophical\r\nTransactions that two navigators, who had undertaken the discovery of\r\nthis passage, shaped a course 300 leagues to the east of Nova Zembla,\r\nbut that the East India Company, who thought it their interest this\r\npassage should not be discovered, hindered them from returning[170:A].\r\nBut the Dutch East India Company thought, on the contrary, that it was\r\ntheir interest to find this passage; having attempted it in vain on the\r\nside of Europe, they sought it by that of Japan, and they would probably\r\nhave succeeded, if the Emperor of Japan had not forbidden all strangers\r\nfrom navigating on the side of the land of Jesso. This passage,\r\ntherefore, cannot be found but by sailing to the pole, beyond\r\nSpitzbergen, or by keeping the open sea between Nova Zembla and\r\nSpitzbergen under the 79th degree of latitude. We need not fear to find\r\nit frozen even under the pole itself, for reasons we have alledged; in\r\nfact, there is no example of the sea being frozen at a considerable\r\ndistance from the shore; the only example of a sea being frozen entirely\r\nover, is that of the Black Sea, which is narrow, contains but little\r\nsalt, and receives a number of rivers from the northern countries, and\r\nwhich bring ice with them: and if we may credit historians, it was\r\nfrozen in the time of the Emperor Copronymus, thirty cubits deep,\r\nwithout reckoning twenty cubits of snow above the ice. This appears to\r\nbe exaggerated, but it is certain that it freezes almost every winter;\r\nwhereas the open seas, a thousand leagues nearer the pole, do not freeze\r\nat all: this can only proceed from the saltness, and the little ice\r\nwhich they receive, in comparison with that transported into the Black\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nThis ice, which is looked upon as a barrier that opposes the navigation\r\nnear the poles, and the discovery of the southern continent, proves only\r\nthat there are large rivers adjacent to the places where it is met\r\nwith; and indicates also there are vast continents from whence these\r\nrivers flow; nor ought we to be discouraged at the sight of these\r\nobstacles; for if we consider, we shall easily perceive, this ice must\r\nbe confined to some particular places; that it is almost impossible that\r\nit should occupy the whole circle which encompasses, as we suppose, the\r\nsouthern continent, and therefore we should probably succeed if we were\r\nto direct our course towards some other point of this circle. The\r\ndescription which Dampier and some others have given of New Holland,\r\nleads us to suspect that this part of the globe is perhaps a part of the\r\nsouthern lands, and is a country less ancient than the rest of this\r\nunknown continent. New Holland is a low country, without water or\r\nmountains, but thinly inhabited, and the natives without industry; all\r\nthis concurs to make us think that they are in this continent nearly\r\nwhat the savages of Amaconia or Paraguais are in America. We have found\r\npolished men, empires, and kings, at Peru and Mexico, which are the\r\nhighest, and consequently the most ancient countries of America.\r\nSavages, on the contrary, are found in the lowest and most modern\r\ncountries; therefore we may presume that we should also find men united\r\nby the bands of society in the upper countries, from whence these great\r\nrivers, which bring this prodigious ice to the sea, derive their\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nThe interior parts of Africa are unknown to us, almost as much as they\r\nwere to the ancients: they had, like us, made the tour of that vast\r\npeninsula, but they have left us neither charts, nor descriptions of the\r\ncoasts. Pliny informs us, that the tour of Africa was made in the time\r\nof Alexander the Great, that the wrecks of some Spanish vessels had been\r\ndiscovered in the Arabian sea, and that Hanno, a Carthaginian general,\r\nhad made a voyage from Gades to the Arabian sea, and that he had written\r\na relation of it. Besides that, he says Cornelius Nepos tells us that in\r\nhis time one Eudoxus, persecuted by the king Lathurus, was obliged to\r\nfly from his country; that departing from the Arabian gulph, he arrived\r\nat Gades, and that before this time they traded from Spain to Ethiopia\r\nby sea[173:A]. Notwithstanding these testimonies of the ancients, we are\r\npersuaded that they never doubled the Cape of Good Hope, and the course\r\nwhich the Portuguese took the first to go to the East-Indies, was\r\nlooked upon as a new discovery; it will not perhaps, therefore, be\r\ndeemed amiss to give the belief of the 9th century on this subject.\r\n\r\n\"In our time an entire new discovery has been made, which was wholly\r\nunknown to those who lived before us. No one thought, or even suspected,\r\nthat the sea, which extends from India to China, had a communication\r\nwith the Syrian sea. We have found, according to what I have learnt, in\r\nthe sea Roum, or Mediterranean, the wreck of an Arabian vessel,\r\nshattered to pieces by the tempest, some of which were carried by the\r\nwind and waves to the Cozar sea, and from thence to the Mediterranean,\r\nand was at length thrown on the coast of Syria. This proves that the sea\r\nsurrounds China and Cila, the extremity of Turqueston and the country of\r\nthe Cozars; that it afterwards flows by the strait till it has washed\r\nthe coast of Syria. The proof is drawn from the construction of the\r\nvessel; for no other vessels but those of Siraf are built without nails,\r\nwhich, as was the wreck we speak of, are joined together in a particular\r\nmanner, as if they were sewed. Those, of all the vessels of the\r\nMediterranean and of the coast of Syria, are nailed and not joined in\r\nthis manner[175:A].\"\r\n\r\nTo this the translator of this ancient relation adds.--\r\n\r\n\"Abuziel remarks, as a new and very extraordinary thing, that a vessel\r\nwas carried from the Indian sea, and cast on the coasts of Syria. To\r\nfind a passage into the Mediterranean, he supposes there is a great\r\nextent above China, which has a communication with the Cozar sea, that\r\nis, with Muscovia. The sea which is below Cape Current, was entirely\r\nunknown to the Arabs, by reason of the extreme danger of the navigation,\r\nand from the continent being inhabited by such a barbarous people, that\r\nit was not easy to subject them, nor even to civilize them by commerce.\r\nFrom the Cape of Good Hope to Soffala, the Portuguese found no\r\nestablished settlement of Moors, like those in all the maritime towns as\r\nfar as China, which was the farthest place known to geographers; but\r\nthey could not tell whether the Chinese sea, by the extremity of Africa,\r\nhad a communication with the sea of Barbary, and they contented\r\nthemselves with describing it as far as the coast of Zing, or\r\nCaffraria. This is the reason why we cannot doubt but that the first\r\ndiscovery of the passage of this sea, by the Cape of Good Hope, was made\r\nby the Europeans, under the conduct of Vasco de Gama, or at least some\r\nyears before he doubled the Cape, if it is true there are marine charts\r\nof an older date, where the Cape is called by the name of Frontiera du\r\nAfrica. Antonio Galvin testifies, from the relation of Francisco de\r\nSousa Tavares, that, in 1528, the Infant Don Ferdinand shewed him such a\r\nchart, which he found in the monastery of Acoboca, dated 120 years\r\nbefore, copied perhaps from that said to be in the treasury of St. Mark,\r\nat Venice, which also marks the point of Africa, according to the\r\ntestimony of Ramusio, &c.\"\r\n\r\nThe ignorance of those ages, on the subject of the navigation around\r\nAfrica, will appear perhaps less singular than the silence of the editor\r\nof this ancient relation on the subject of the passages of Herodotus,\r\nPliny, &c. which we have quoted, and which proves the ancients had made\r\nthe tour of Africa.\r\n\r\nBe it as it may, the African coasts are now well known; but whatever\r\nattempts have been made to penetrate into the inner parts of the\r\ncountry, we have not been able to attain sufficient knowledge of it to\r\ngive exact relations[177:A]. It might, nevertheless, be of great\r\nadvantage, if we were, by Senegal, or some other river, to get farther\r\nup the country and establish settlements, as we should find, according\r\nto all appearances, a country as rich in precious mines as Peru or the\r\nBrazils. It is perfectly known that the African rivers abound with gold,\r\nand as this country is very mountainous, and situated under the equator,\r\nit is not to be doubted but it contains, as well as America, mines of\r\nheavy metals, and of the most compact and hard stones.\r\n\r\nThe vast extent of north and east Tartary has only been discovered in\r\nthese latter times. If the Muscovite maps are just, we are at present\r\nacquainted with the coasts of all this part of Asia; and it appears that\r\nfrom the point of eastern Tartary to North America, it is not more than\r\nfour or five hundred leagues: it has even been pretended that this tract\r\nwas much shorter, for in the Amsterdam Gazette, of the 24th of January,\r\n1747, it is said, under the article of Petersburgh, that Mr.\r\nStalleravoit had discovered one of these American islands beyond\r\nKamschatca, and demonstrated that we might go thither from Russia by a\r\nshorter tract. The Jesuits, and other missionaries, have also pretended\r\nto have discovered savages in Tartary, whom they had catechised in\r\nAmerica, which should in fact suppose that passage to be still\r\nshorter[178:A]. This author even pretends, that the two continents of\r\nthe old and new world join by the north, and says, that the last\r\nnavigations of the Japanese afford room to judge, that the tract of\r\nwhich we have spoken is only a bay, above which we may pass by land from\r\nAsia to America. But this requires confirmation, for hitherto it has\r\nbeen thought that the continent of the north pole is separated from the\r\nother continents, as well as that of the south pole.\r\n\r\nAstronomy and Navigation are carried to so high a pitch of perfection,\r\nthat it may reasonably be expected we shall soon have an exact\r\nknowledge of the whole surface of the globe. The ancients knew only a\r\nsmall part of it, because they had not the mariner's compass. Some\r\npeople have pretended that the Arabs invented the compass, and used it a\r\nlong time before we did, to trade on the Indian sea, as far as China;\r\nbut this opinion has always appeared destitute of all probability; for\r\nthere is no word in the Arab, Turkish, or Persian languages, which\r\nsignifies the compass; they make use of the Italian word Bossola; they\r\ndo not even at present know how to make a compass, nor give the\r\nmagnetical quality to the needle, but purchase them from the Europeans.\r\nFather Maritini says, that the Chinese have been acquainted with the\r\ncompass for upwards of 3000 years; but if that was the case, how comes\r\nit that they have made so little use of it? Why did they, in their\r\nvoyages to Cochinchina, take a course much longer than was necessary?\r\nAnd why did they always confine themselves to the same voyages, the\r\ngreatest of which were to Java and Sumatra? And why did not they\r\ndiscover, before the Europeans, an infinity of fertile islands,\r\nbordering on their own country, if they had possessed the art of\r\nnavigating in the open seas? For a few years after the discovery of\r\nthis wonderful property of the loadstone, the Portuguese doubled the\r\nCape of Good Hope, traversed the African and Indian seas, and\r\nChristopher Columbus made his voyage to America.\r\n\r\nBy a little consideration, it was easy to divine there were immense\r\nspaces towards the west; for, by comparing the known part of the globe,\r\nas for example, the distance of Spain to China, and attending to the\r\nrevolution of the Earth and Heavens, it was easy to see that there\r\nremained a much greater extent towards the west to be discovered, than\r\nwhat they were acquainted with towards the east. It, therefore, was not\r\nfrom the defect of astronomical knowledge that the ancients did not find\r\nthe new world, but only for want of the compass. The passages of Plato\r\nand Aristotle, where they speak of countries far distant from the\r\nPillars of Hercules, seem to indicate that some navigators had been\r\ndriven by tempest as far as America, from whence they returned with much\r\ndifficulty; and it may be conjectured, that if even the ancients had\r\nbeen persuaded of the existence of this continent, they would not have\r\neven thought it possible to strike out the road, having no guide nor\r\nany knowledge of the compass.\r\n\r\nI own, that it is not impossible to traverse the high seas without a\r\ncompass, and that very resolute people might have undertaken to seek\r\nafter the new world by conducting themselves simply by the stars. The\r\nAstrolabe being known to the ancients, it might strike them they could\r\nleave France or Spain, and sail to the west, by keeping the polar star\r\nalways to the right, and by frequent soundings might have kept nearly in\r\nthe same latitude; without doubt the Carthaginians, of whom Aristotle\r\nmakes mention, found the means of returning from these remote countries\r\nby keeping the polar star to the left; but it must be allowed that a\r\nlike voyage would be looked upon as a rash enterprize, and that\r\nconsequently we must not be astonished that the ancients had not even\r\nconceived the project.\r\n\r\nPrevious to Christopher Columbus's expedition, the Azores, the Canaries,\r\nand Madeira were discovered. It was remarked, that when the west winds\r\nlasted a long time, the sea brought pieces of foreign wood on the coast\r\nof these islands, canes of unknown species, and even dead bodies, which\r\nby many marks were discovered to be neither European nor African.\r\nColumbus himself remarked, that on the side of the west certain winds\r\nblew only a few days, and which he was persuaded were land winds; but\r\nalthough he had all these advantages over the ancients, and the\r\nknowledge of the compass, the difficulties still to conquer were so\r\ngreat, that there was only the success he met with which could justify\r\nthe enterprise. Suppose, for a moment, that the continent of the new\r\nworld had been 1000 or 1500 miles farther than it in fact is, a thing\r\nwith Columbus could neither know nor foresee, he would not have arrived\r\nthere, and perhaps this great country might still have remained unknown.\r\nThis conjecture is so much the better founded, as Columbus, although the\r\nmost able navigator of his time, was seized with fear and astonishment\r\nin his second voyage to the new world; for as in his first, he only\r\nfound some islands, he directed his course more to the south to discover\r\na continent, and was stopt by currents, the considerable extent and\r\ndirection of which always opposed his course, and obliged him to direct\r\nhis search to the west; he imagined that what had hindered him from\r\nadvancing on the southern side was not currents, but that the sea flowed\r\nby raising itself towards the heavens, and that perhaps both one and the\r\nother touched on the southern side. True it is, that in great\r\nenterprises the least unfortunate circumstance may turn a man's brain,\r\nand abate his courage.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[163:A] Vide Herodotus, lib. iv.\r\n\r\n[167:A] See the Hist. of the Acad.

Vol. III.\r\npage 30 and 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE VII.\r\n\r\nON THE PRODUCTION OF THE STRATA, OR BEDS OF EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have shewn, in the first article, that by virtue of the mutual\r\nattraction between the parts of matter, and of the centrifugal force,\r\nwhich results from its diurnal rotation, the earth has necessarily taken\r\nthe form of a spheroid, the diameters of which differ about a 230th\r\npart, and that it could only proceed from the changes on the surface,\r\ncaused by the motion of the air and water, that this difference could\r\nbecome greater, as is pretended to be the case from the measures taken\r\nunder the equator, and within the polar circle. This figure of the\r\nearth, which so well agrees with hydrostatical laws, and with our\r\ntheory, supposes the globe to have been in a state of liquefaction when\r\nit assumed its form, and we have proved that the motions of projection\r\nand rotation were imprinted at the same time by a like impulsion. We\r\nshall the more easily believe that the earth has been in a state of\r\nliquefaction produced by fire, when we consider the nature of the\r\nmatters which the globe incloses, the greatest part of which are\r\nvitrified or vitrifiable; especially when we reflect on the\r\nimpossibility there is that the earth should ever have been in a state\r\nof fluidity, produced by the waters; since there is infinitely more\r\nearth than water, and that water has not the power of dissolving stone,\r\nsand, and other matters of which the earth is composed.\r\n\r\nIt is plain then that the earth took its figure at the time when it was\r\nliquefied by fire: by pursuing our hypothesis it appears, that when the\r\nsun quitted it, the earth had no other form than that of a torrent of\r\nmelted and inflamed vapour matter; that this torrent collected itself by\r\nthe mutual attraction of its parts, and became a globe, to which the\r\nrotative motion gave the figure of a spheroid; and when the earth was\r\ncooled, the vapours, which were first extended like the tails of comets,\r\nby degrees condensed and fell upon the surface, depositing, at the same\r\ntime, a slimy substance mixed with sulphurous and saline matters, a part\r\nof which, by the motion of the waters, was swept into the perpendicular\r\ncracks, where it produced metals, while the rest remained on the\r\nsurface, and produced that reddish earth which forms the first strata;\r\nand which, according to different places, is more or less blended with\r\nanimal and vegetable particles, so reduced that the organization is no\r\nlonger perceptible.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the first state of the earth, the globe was internally\r\ncomposed of vitrified matter, as I believe it is at present, above which\r\nwere placed those bodies the fire had most divided, as sand, which are\r\nonly fragments of glass; and above these, pumice stones and the scoria\r\nof the vitrified matter, which formed the various clays; the whole was\r\ncovered with water 5 or 600 feet deep, produced by the condensation of\r\nthe vapours, when the globe began to cool. This water every where\r\ndeposited a muddy bed, mixed with waters which sublime and exhale by the\r\nfire; and the air was formed of the most subtile vapours, which, by\r\ntheir lightness, disengaged themselves from the waters, and surmounted\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of the globe when the action of the tides, the winds,\r\nand the heat of the sun, began to change the surface of the earth. The\r\ndiurnal motion, and the flux and reflux, at first raised the waters\r\nunder the southern climate, which carried with them mud, clay, and sand,\r\nand by raising the parts of the equator, they by degrees perhaps lowered\r\nthose of the poles about two leagues, as we before mentioned; for the\r\nwaters soon reduced into powder the pumice stones and other spongeous\r\nparts of the vitrified matter that were at the surface, they hollowed\r\nsome places, and raised others, which in course of time became\r\ncontinents, and produced all the inequalities, and which are more\r\nconsiderable towards the equator than the poles; for the highest\r\nmountains are between the tropics and the middle of the temperate zones,\r\nand the lowest are from the polar circle to the poles; between the\r\ntropics are the Cordeliers, and almost all the mountains of Mexico and\r\nBrazil, the great and little Atlas, the Moon, &c. Beside the land which\r\nis between the tropics, from the superior number of islands found in\r\nthose parts, is the most unequal of all the globe, as evidently is the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nHowever independent my theory may be of that hypothesis of what passed\r\nat the time of the first state of the globe, I refer to it in this\r\narticle, in order to shew the connection and possibility of the system\r\nwhich I endeavoured to maintain in the first article. It must only be\r\nremarked, that my theory does not stray far from it, as I take the earth\r\nin a state nearly similar to what it appears at present, and as I do not\r\nmake use of any of the suppositions which are used on reasoning on the\r\npast state of the terrestrial globe. But as I here present a new idea on\r\nthe subject of the sediment deposited by the water, which, in my\r\nopinion, has perforated the upper bed of earth, it appears to me also\r\nnecessary to give the reason on which I found this opinion.\r\n\r\nThe vapours which rise in the air produce rain, dew, aerial fires,\r\nthunder, and other meteors. These vapours are therefore blended with\r\naqueous, aerial, sulphurous and terrestrial particles, &c. and it is the\r\nsolid and earthy particles which form the mud or slime we are now\r\nspeaking of. When rain water is suffered to rest, a sediment is formed\r\nat bottom; and having collected a quantity, if it is suffered to stand\r\nand corrupt, it produces a kind of mud which falls to the bottom of the\r\nvessel. Dew produces much more of this mud than rain water, which is\r\ngreasy, unctuous, and of a reddish colour.\r\n\r\nThe first strata of the earth is composed of this mud, mixed with\r\nperished vegetable or animal parts, or rather stony and sandy particles.\r\nWe may remark that almost all land proper for cultivation is reddish,\r\nand more or less mixed with these different matters; the particles of\r\nsand or stone found there are of two kinds, the one coarse and heavy,\r\nthe other fine and sometimes impalpable. The largest comes from the\r\nlower strata loosened in cultivating the earth, or rather the upper\r\nmould, by penetrating into the lower, which is of sand and other divided\r\nmatters, and forms those earths we call fat and fertile. The finer sort\r\nproceeds from the air, and falls with dew and rain, and mixes intimately\r\nwith the soil. This is properly the residue of the powder, which the\r\nwind continually raises from the surface of the earth, and which falls\r\nagain after having imbibed the humidity of the air. When the earth\r\npredominates, and the stony and sandy parts are but few, the earth is\r\nthen reddish and fertile: if it is mixed with a considerable quantity of\r\nperished animal or vegetable substances, it is blackish, and often more\r\nfertile than the first; but if the mould is only in a small quantity, as\r\nwell as the animal or vegetable parts, the earth is white and sterile,\r\nand when the sandy, stony, or cretaceous parts which compose these\r\nsterile lands, are mixed with a sufficient quantity of perished animal\r\nor vegetable substances, they form the black and lighter earths, but\r\nhave little fertility; so that according to the different combinations\r\nof these three different matters, the land is more or less fecund and\r\ndifferently coloured.\r\n\r\nTo fix some ideas relative to these stratas; let us take, for example,\r\nthe earth of Marly-la-ville, where the pits are very deep: it is a high\r\ncountry, but flat and fertile, and its strata lie arranged horizontally.\r\nI had samples brought me of all these strata which M. Dalibard, an able\r\nbotanist, versed in different sciences, had dug under his inspection;\r\nand after having proved the matters of which they consisted in\r\naquafortis, I formed the following table of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The state of the different beds of earth, found at Marly-la-ville,\r\n     to the depth of 100 feet.\r\n\r\n                                             Feet.

Those shells have\r\nbeen transported by the motion of the water, at the same time as the\r\nsand in which they are met with, and the whole of the upper strata, even\r\nto the first, have been transported after the same manner by the motion\r\nof the water, and deposited in form of a sediment; which we cannot\r\ndoubt, as well by reason of their horizontal position, as of the\r\ndifferent beds of sand mixed with shells and marl, the last of which are\r\nonly the fragments of the shells. The last stratum itself has been\r\nformed almost entirely by the mould we have spoken of, mixed with a\r\nsmall part of the marl which was at the surface.\r\n\r\nI have chosen this example, as the most disadvantageous to my theory,\r\nbecause it at first appears very difficult to conceive that the dust of\r\nthe air, rain and dew, could produce strata of free earth thirteen feet\r\nthick; but it ought to be observed, that it is very rare to find,\r\nespecially in high lands, so considerable a thickness of cultivateable\r\nearth; it is generally about three or four feet, and often not more than\r\none. In plains surrounded with hills, this thickness of good earth is\r\nthe greatest, because the rain loosens the earth of the hills, and\r\ncarries it into the vallies; but without supposing any thing of that\r\nkind, I find that the last strata formed by the waters are thick beds of\r\nmarl. It is natural to imagine that the upper stratum had, at the\r\nbeginning, a still greater thickness, besides the thirteen feet of marl,\r\nwhen the sea quitted the land and left it naked. This marl, exposed to\r\nthe air, melted with the rain; the action of the air and heat of the sun\r\nproduced flaws, and reduced it into powder on the surface; the sea would\r\nnot quit this land precipitately, but sometimes cover it, either by the\r\nalternative motion of the tides, or by the extraordinary elevation of\r\nthe waters in foul weather, when it mixed with this bed of marl, mud,\r\nclay, and other matters. When the land was raised above the waters,\r\nplants would begin to grow, and it was then that the dust in the rain or\r\ndew by degrees added to its substance and gave it a reddish colour; this\r\nthickness and fertility was soon augmented by culture; by digging and\r\ndividing its surface, and thus giving to the dust, in the dew or rain,\r\nthe facility of more deeply penetrating it, which at last produced that\r\nbed of free earth thirteen feet thick.\r\n\r\nI shall not here examine whether the reddish colour of vegetable earth\r\nproceeds from the iron which is contained in the earths that are\r\ndeposited by the rains and dews, but being of importance, shall take\r\nnotice of it when we come to treat of minerals; it is sufficient to have\r\nexplained our conception of the formation of the superficial strata of\r\nthe earth, and by other examples we shall prove, that the formation of\r\nthe interior strata, can only be the work of the waters.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the globe, says Woodward, this external stratum on which\r\nmen and animals walk, which serves as a magazine for the formation of\r\nvegetables and animals, is, for the greatest part, composed of vegetable\r\nor animal matter, and is in continual motion and variation. All animals\r\nand vegetables which have existed from the creation of the world, have\r\nsuccessively extracted from this stratum the matter which composes it,\r\nand have, after their deaths, restored to it this borrowed matter: it\r\nremains there always ready to be retaken, and to serve for the formation\r\nof other bodies of the same species successively, for the matter which\r\ncomposes one body is proper and natural to form another body of the same\r\nkind. In uninhabited countries, where the woods are never cut, where\r\nanimals do not brouze on the plants, this stratum of vegetable earth\r\nincreases considerably. In all woods, even in those which are sometimes\r\ncut, there is a bed of mould, of six or eight inches thick, formed\r\nentirely by the leaves, small branches, and barks which have perished. I\r\nhave often observed on the ancient Roman way, which crosses Burgundy in\r\na long extent of soil, that there is formed a bed of black earth more\r\nthan a foot thick upon the stones, which nourishes very high trees; and\r\nthis stratum could be composed only of a black mould formed by the\r\nleaves, bark, and perished wood. As vegetables inhale for their\r\nnutriment much more from the air and water than the earth, it happens\r\nthat when they perish, they return to the earth more than they have\r\ntaken from it. Besides, forests collect the rain water, and by stopping\r\nthe vapours increase their moisture; so in a wood which is preserved a\r\nlong time, the stratum of earth which serves for vegetation increases\r\nconsiderably. But animals restoring less to the earth than they take\r\nfrom it, and men making enormous consumption of wood and plants for\r\nfire, and other uses, it follows that the vegetable soil of inhabited\r\ncountries must diminish, and become, in time, like the soil of Arabia\r\nPetrea, and other eastern provinces, which, in fact, are the most\r\nancient inhabited countries, where only sand and salt are now to be met\r\nwith; for the fixed salts of plants and animals remain, whereas all the\r\nother parts volatilise, and are transported by the air.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the position and formation of the interior strata:\r\nthe earth, says Woodward, appears in places that have been dug, composed\r\nof strata placed one on the other, as so many sediments which\r\nnecessarily fell to the bottom of the water; the deepest strata are\r\ngenerally the thickest, and those above the thinnest, and so gradually\r\nlessening to the surface. We find sea shells, teeth, and bones of fish\r\nin these different beds, and not only in those that are soft, as chalk\r\nand clay, but even in those of hard stone, marble, &c. These marine\r\nproductions are incorporated with the stone, and when separated from\r\nthem, leave the impressions of the shells with the greatest exactness.\r\n\"I have been most clearly and positively assured,\" says this author,\r\n\"that in France, Flanders, Holland, Spain, Italy, Germany, Denmark,\r\nNorway, and Sweden, stone, and other terrestrial substances are disposed\r\nin strata, precisely the same as they are in England; that these strata\r\nare divided by parallel fissures; that there are inclosed within stones\r\nand other terrestrial and compact substances, a great quantity of shells\r\nand other productions of the sea, disposed in the same manner as in this\r\nisland. I am also informed that these strata are found the same in\r\nBarbary, Egypt, Guinea, and in other parts of Africa; in Arabia, Syria,\r\nPersia, Malabar, China, and the rest of the provinces of Asia; in\r\nJamaica, Barbadoes, Virginia, New-England, Brazil, and other parts of\r\nAmerica[198:A].\"\r\n\r\nThis author does not say how he learnt, or by whom he was told, that the\r\nstrata of Peru contained shells; yet as in general his observations are\r\nexact, I do not doubt but he was well informed; and am persuaded that\r\nshells may be found in the earth of Peru, as well as elsewhere. This\r\nremark is made from a doubt having been formed some time since on the\r\nsubject, and which I shall hereafter consider.\r\n\r\nIn a trench made at Amsterdam, to the depth of 230 feet, the strata were\r\nfound as follows: 7 feet of vegetable earth, 9 of turf, 9 of soft clay,\r\n8 of sand, 4 of earth, 10 of clay, 4 of earth, 10 of sand, then 2 feet\r\nof clay, 4 of white sand, 5 of dry earth, 1 of soft earth, 14 of sand, 8\r\nof argil, mixed with earth; 4 of sand, mixed with shells; then clay 102\r\nfeet thick, and at last 31 feet of sand, at which depth they ceased\r\ndigging[199:A].\r\n\r\nIt is very singular to dig so deep without meeting with water: and this\r\ncircumstance is remarkable in many particulars. 1. It shews, that the\r\nwater of the sea does not communicate with the interior part of the\r\nearth, by means of filtration. 2. That shells are found at the depth of\r\n100 feet below the surface, and that consequently the soil of Holland\r\nhas been raised 100 feet by the sediment of the sea. 3. We may draw an\r\ninduction, that this strata of thick clay of 102 feet, and the bed of\r\nsand below it, in which they dug to 31 feet, and whose entire thickness\r\nis unknown, are perhaps not very far distant from the first strata of\r\nthe original earth, such as it was before the motion of the water had\r\nchanged its surface. We have said in the first article, that if we\r\ndesired to find the ancient earth, we should dig in the northern\r\ncountries, rather than towards the south; in plains rather than in\r\nmountainous regions. The circumstances in this instance, appear to be\r\nnearly so, only it is to be wished they had continued the digging to a\r\ngreater depth, and that the author had informed us, whether there were\r\nnot shells and other marine productions, in the last bed of clay, and in\r\nthat of sand below it. The experiment confirms what we have already\r\nsaid; and the more we dig, the greater thickness we shall find the\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nThe earth is composed of parallel and horizontal beds, not only in\r\nplains, but hills and mountains are in general composed after the same\r\nmanner: it may be said, that the strata in hills and mountains are more\r\napparent there than in the plains, because the plains are generally\r\ncovered with a very considerable quantity of sand and earth, which the\r\nwater has brought from the higher grounds, and therefore, to find the\r\nancient strata, must dig deeper in the plains than in the mountains.\r\n\r\nI have often observed, that when a mountain is level at its summit, the\r\nstrata which compose it are also level; but if the summit is not placed\r\nhorizontally, the strata inclines also in the same direction. I have\r\nheard that, in general, the beds of quarries inclined a little to the\r\neast; but having myself observed all the chains of rocks which offered,\r\nI discovered this opinion to be erroneous, and that the strata inclines\r\nto the same side as the hill, whether it be east, west, north, or south.\r\nWhen we dig stone and marble from the quarry, we take great care to\r\nseparate them according to their natural position, and we cannot even\r\nget them of a large size, if we cut them in any other direction. Where\r\nthey are made use of for good masonry, the workmen are particular in\r\nplacing them as they stood in the quarry, for if they were placed in any\r\nother direction, they would split, and would not resist the weight with\r\nwhich they are loaded. This perfectly confirms that stones, are found\r\nin parallel and horizontal strata, which have been successively heaped\r\none on the other, and that these strata composed masses where resistance\r\nis greater in that direction than in any other.\r\n\r\nEvery strata, whether horizontal or inclined, has an equal thickness\r\nthroughout its whole extent. In the quarries about Paris the bed of good\r\nstone is not thick, scarcely more than 18 or 20 feet: in those of\r\nBurgundy the stone is much thicker. It is the same with marble; the\r\nblack and white marble have a thicker bed than the coloured; and I know\r\nbeds of very hard stone, which the farmers in Burgundy make use of to\r\ncover their houses, that are not above an inch thick. The different\r\nstrata vary much in thickness, but each bed preserves the same thickness\r\nthroughout its extent. The thickness of strata is so greatly varied,\r\nthat it is found from less than a line to 1, 10, 20, 30, or 100 feet\r\nthick. The ancient and modern quarries, which are horizontally dug, the\r\nperpendicular and other divisions of mines, prove that there are\r\nextensive strata in all directions. \"It is thoroughly proved,\" says the\r\nhistorian of the academy, \"that all stones have formerly been a soft\r\npaste, and as there are quarries almost in every part, the surface of\r\nthe earth has therefore consisted, in all these places, of mud and\r\nslime, at least to certain depths. The shells found in most quarries\r\nprove that this mud was an earth diluted by the water of the sea, and\r\nconsequently that the sea covered all these places; and it could not\r\ncover them without also covering all that was level with or lower than\r\nit: and it is plain that it could not cover every place where there were\r\nquarries, without covering the whole face of the terrestrial globe. We\r\ndo not here consider the mountains which the sea must also at one time\r\nhave covered, since quarries and shells are often found in them.\r\n\r\n\"The sea,\" continues he, \"therefore, covered the whole earth, and from\r\nthence it proceeds that all the beds of stone in the plains are\r\nhorizontal and parallel; fish must have also been the most ancient\r\ninhabitants of the globe, as there was no sustenance for either birds or\r\nterrestrial animals.\" But how did the sea retire into these vast basins\r\nwhich it at present occupies? What presents itself the most natural to\r\nthe mind is, that the earth, at least at a certain depth, was not\r\nentirely solid, but intermixed with some great vacuums, whose vaults\r\nwere supported for a time, but at length, sunk in suddenly: then the\r\nwaters must have fallen into these vacancies, filled them, and left\r\nnaked a part of the earth's surface, which became an agreeable abode to\r\nterrestrial animals and birds. The shells found in quarries perfectly\r\nagree with this idea, for only the bony parts of fish could be preserved\r\ntill now. In general, shells are heaped up in great abundance in certain\r\nparts of the sea, where they are immovable, and form a kind of rock, and\r\ncould not follow the water, which suddenly forsook them: this is the\r\nreason that we find more shells than bones of the fish, and this even\r\nproves a sudden fall of the sea into its present basins. At the same\r\ntime as our supposed vaults gave way, it is very possible that other\r\nparts of the globe were raised by the same cause, and that mountains\r\nwere placed on this surface with quarries already formed, but the beds\r\nof these quarries could not preserve the horizontal direction they\r\nbefore had, unless the mountains were raised precisely perpendicular to\r\nthe surface of the earth, which could happen but very seldom: so also,\r\nas we have already observed, in 1705, the beds of stone in mountains are\r\nalways inclined to the horizon, though parallel with each other; for\r\nthey have not changed their position with respect to each other, but\r\nonly with respect to the surface of the earth[205:A].\r\n\r\nThese parallel strata, these beds of earth and stone, which have been\r\nformed by the sediment of the sea, often extend to considerable\r\ndistances, and we often find in hills, separated by a valley, the same\r\nbeds and the same matters at the same level. This observation agrees\r\nperfectly with that of the height of the opposite hills. We may easily\r\nbe assured of the truth of these facts, for in all narrow vallies, where\r\nrocks are discovered, we shall find the same beds of stone and marble on\r\nboth sides at the same height. In a country where I frequently reside, I\r\nfound a quarry of marble which extended more than 12 leagues in length,\r\nand whose breadth was very considerable, although I have never been able\r\nprecisely to determine it. I have often observed that this bed of marble\r\nis throughout of the same thickness, and in hills divided from this\r\nquarry by a valley of 100 feet depth, and a quarter of a mile in\r\nbreadth, I found the same bed of marble at the same height. I am\r\npersuaded it is the same in every stone and marble quarry where shells\r\nare found; but this observation does not hold good in quarries of\r\nfreestone. In the course of this work, we shall give reasons for this\r\ndifference, and describe why freestone is not dispersed, like other\r\nmatters, in horizontal beds, and why it is in irregular blocks, both in\r\nform and position.\r\n\r\nWe have likewise observed that the strata are the same on both sides the\r\nstraits of the sea. This observation, which is important, may lead us to\r\ndiscover the lands and islands which have been separated from the\r\ncontinent; it proves, for example, that England has been divided from\r\nFrance; Spain from Africa; Sicily from Italy; and it is to be wished\r\nthat the same observation had been made in all the straits. I am\r\npersuaded that we should find it almost every where true. We do not know\r\nwhether the same beds of stone are found at the same height on both\r\nsides the straits of Magellan, which is the longest; but we see, by the\r\nparticular maps and exact charts, that the two high coasts which confine\r\nit, form nearly, like the mountains of the earth, correspondent angles,\r\nwhich also proves that the Terra del Fuega, must be regarded as part of\r\nthe continent of America; it is the same with Forbisher's Strait and\r\nthe island of Friesland, which appear to have been divided from the\r\ncontinent of Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe Maldivian islands are only separated by small tracts of the sea, on\r\neach side of which banks and rocks are found composed of the same\r\nmaterials; and these islands, which, taken together, are near 200 miles\r\nlong, formed anciently only one land; they are now divided into 13\r\nprovinces, called Clusters. Each cluster contains a great number of\r\nsmall islands, most of which are sometimes overflowed and sometimes dry;\r\nbut what is remarkable, these thirteen clusters are each surrounded with\r\na chain of rocks of the same stone, and there are only three or four\r\ndangerous inlets by which they can be entered. They are all placed one\r\nafter the other, and it evidently appears that these islands were\r\nformerly a long mountain capped with rocks[216:A].\r\n\r\nMany authors, as Verstegan, Twine, Somner, and especially Campbell, in\r\nhis Description of England, in the chapter of Kent, gives very strong\r\nreasons, to prove that England was formerly joined to France, and has\r\nbeen separated from it by an effort of the sea, which carried away the\r\nneck of land that joined them, opened the channel, and left naked a\r\ngreat quantity of low and marshy ground along the southern coasts of\r\nEngland. Dr. Wallis, as a corroboration of this supposition, shews the\r\nconformity of the ancient Gallic and British tongues, and adds many\r\nobservations, which we shall relate in the following articles.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the form of lands, the position of mountains, and the\r\nwindings of rivers, we shall perceive that generally opposite hills are\r\nnot only composed of the same matters on the same level, but are nearly\r\nof an equal height. This equality I have observed in my travels, and\r\nhave mostly found them the same on the two sides, especially in vallies\r\nthat were not more than a quarter or a third of a league broad, for in\r\nvallies which are very broad, it is difficult to judge of the height and\r\nequality of hills, because, by looking over a level plain of any great\r\nextent, it appears to rise, and hills at a distance appear to lower; but\r\nthis is not the place to give a mathematical reason for this difference.\r\nIt is also very difficult to judge by the naked sight of the middle of a\r\ngreat valley, at least if there is no river in it; whereas in confined\r\nvallies our sight is less equivocal and our judgment more certain. That\r\npart of Burgundy comprehended between Auxerre, Dijon, Autun, and\r\nBar-sur-seine, a considerable extent of which is called _la Bailliage de\r\nla Montagne_, is one of the highest parts of France; from one side of\r\nmost of these mountains, which are only of the second class, the water\r\nflows towards the Ocean, and on the other side towards the\r\nMediterranean. This high country is divided with many small vallies,\r\nvery confined, and almost all watered with rivulets. I have a thousand\r\ntimes observed the correspondence of the angles of these hills and their\r\nequality of height, and I am certain that I have every where found the\r\nsaliant angles opposite to the returning angles, and the heights nearly\r\nequal on both sides. The farther we advance into the higher country,\r\nwhere the points of division are, the higher are the mountains; but this\r\nheight is always the same on both sides of the vallies, and the hills\r\nare raised or lowered alike. I have frequently made the like\r\nobservations in many other parts of France. It is this equality in the\r\nheight of the hills which forms the plains in the mountains, and these\r\nplains form lands higher than others. But high mountains do not appear\r\nso equal in height, most of them terminate in points and irregular\r\npeaks; and I have seen, in crossing the Alps, and the Apennine\r\nmountains, that the angles are, in fact, correspondent; but it is almost\r\nimpossible to judge by the eye of the equality or inequality in the\r\nheight of opposite mountains, because their summits are lost in mists\r\nand clouds.\r\n\r\nThe different strata of which the earth is composed are not disposed\r\naccording to their specific weight, for we often find strata of heavy\r\nmatters placed on those of lighter. To be assured of this, we have only\r\nto examine the earth on which rocks are placed, and we shall find that\r\nit is generally clay or sand, which is specifically lighter. In hills,\r\nand other small elevations, we easily discover this to be the case; but\r\nit is not so with large mountains, for not only their summits are rocks,\r\nbut those rocks are placed on others; there mountains are placed upon\r\nmountains, and rocks upon rocks, to such a considerable height, and\r\nthrough so great an extent of country, that we can scarcely be certain\r\nwhether there is earth at bottom, or of what nature it is. I have seen\r\ncavities made in rocks to some hundred feet deep, without being able to\r\nform an idea where they ended, for these rocks were supported by\r\nothers; nevertheless, may we not compare great with small? and since\r\nthe rocks of little mountains, whose bases are to be seen, rest on the\r\nearth less heavy and solid than stone, may we not suppose that earth is\r\nalso the base of high mountains? All that I have here to prove by these\r\narguments is, that, by the motion of the waters, it may naturally happen\r\nthat the more ponderous matters accumulated on the lighter; and that, if\r\nthis in fact is found to be so in most hills, it is probable that it\r\nhappened as explained by my theory; but should it be objected that I am\r\nnot grounded in supposing, that before the formation of mountains the\r\nheaviest matters were below the lighter; I answer, that I assert nothing\r\ngeneral in this respect, because this effect may have been produced in\r\nmany manners, whether the heaviest matters were uppermost or undermost,\r\nor placed indiscriminately. To conceive how the sea at first formed a\r\nmountain of clay, and afterwards capt it with rocks, it is sufficient to\r\nconsider the sediments may successively come from different parts, and\r\nthat they might be of different materials. In some parts, the sea may at\r\nfirst have deposited sediments of clay, and the waters afterwards\r\nbrought sediment of strong matter, either because they had transported\r\nall the clay from the bottom and sides, and then the waves attacked the\r\nrocks, possibly because the first sediment came from one part, and the\r\nsecond from another. This perfectly agrees with observation, by which we\r\nperceive that beds of earth, stone, gravel, sand, &c. followed no rule\r\nin their arrangement, but are placed indifferently one on the other as\r\nit were by chance.\r\n\r\nBut this chance must have some rules, which can be known only by\r\nestimating the value of probabilities, and the truth of conjectures.\r\nAccording to our hypothesis, on the formation of the globe, we have seen\r\nthat the interior part of the globe must have been a vitrified matter,\r\nsimilar to vitrified sand, which is only the fragments of glass, and of\r\nwhich the clays are perhaps the scoria; by this supposition, the centre\r\nof the earth, and almost as far as the external circumference, must be\r\nglass, or a vitrified matter; and above this we shall find sand, clay,\r\nand other scoria. Thus the earth, in its first state, was a nucleus of\r\nglass, or vitrified matter; either massive like glass, or divided like\r\nsand, because that depends on the degree of heat it has undergone. Above\r\nthis matter was sand, and lastly clay. The soil of the waters and air\r\nproduced the external crust, which is thicker or thinner, according to\r\nthe situation of the ground; more or less coloured, according to the\r\ndifferent mixtures of mud, sand, clay, and the decayed parts of animals\r\nand vegetables; and more or less fertile, according to the abundance or\r\nwant of these parts. To shew that this supposition on the formation of\r\nsand and clay is not chimerical, I shall add some particular remarks.\r\n\r\nI conceive, that the earth, in its first state, was a globe, or rather a\r\nspheroid of compact glass, covered with a light crust of pumice stone\r\nand other scoria of the matter in fusion. The motion and agitation of\r\nthe waters and air soon reduced this crust into powder or sand, which,\r\nby uniting afterwards, produced flints, and owe their hardness, colour,\r\nor transparency and variety, to the different degrees of purity of the\r\nsand which entered into their composition.\r\n\r\nThese sands, whose constituting parts unite by fire, assimilate, and\r\nbecome very dense, compact, and the more transparent as the sand is more\r\npure; on the contrary, being exposed a long time to the air, they\r\ndisunite and exfoliate, descend in the form of earth, and it is\r\nprobable the different clays are thus produced. This dust, sometimes of\r\na brightish yellow, and sometimes like silver, is nothing else but a\r\nvery pure sand somewhat perished, and almost reduced to an elementary\r\nstate. By time, particles will be so far attenuated and divided, that\r\nthey will no longer have power to reflect the light, and acquire all the\r\nproperties of clay.\r\n\r\nThis theory is conformable to what every day is seen; let us immediately\r\nwash sand upon its being dug, and the water will be loaded with a black\r\nductile and fat earth, which is genuine clay. In streets paved with\r\nfreestone, the dirt is always black and greasy, and when dried appears\r\nto be an earth of the same nature as clay. Let us wash the earth taken\r\nfrom a spot where there are neither freestone nor flints, and there will\r\nalways precipitate a great quantity of vitrifiable sand.\r\n\r\nBut what perfectly proves that sand, and even flint and glass, exist in\r\nclay, is, that the action of fire, by uniting the parts, restores it to\r\nits original form. Clay, if heated to the degree of calcination, will\r\ncover itself with a very hard enamel; if it is not vitrified internally,\r\nit nevertheless will have acquired a very great hardness, so as to\r\nresist the file; it will emit fire under the hammer, and it has all the\r\nproperties of flint; a greater degree of heat causes it to flow, and\r\nconverts it into real glass.\r\n\r\nClay and sand are therefore matters perfectly analogous, and of the same\r\nclass; if clay, by condensing, may become flint and glass, why may not\r\nsand, by dissolution, become clay? Glass appears to be true elementary\r\nearth, and all mixed substances disguised glass. Metals, minerals,\r\nsalts, &c. are only vitrifiable earth; common stone and other matters\r\nanalogous to it, and testaceous and crustaceous shells, &c. are the only\r\nsubstances which cannot be vitrified, and which seem to form a separate\r\nclass. Fire, by uniting the divided parts of the first, forms an\r\nhomogeneous matter, hard and transparent, without any diminution of\r\nweight, and to which it is not possible to cause any alteration; those,\r\non the contrary, in which a greater quantity of active and volatile\r\nprinciples enter, and which calcine, lose more than one-third of their\r\nweight in the fire, and retake the form of simple earth, without any\r\nother alteration than a disunion of their different parts: these bodies\r\nexcepted, which are no great number, and whose combinations produce no\r\ngreat varieties in nature, every other substance, and particularly\r\nclay, may be converted into glass, and are consequently only decomposed\r\nglass. If the fire suddenly causes the form of these substances to\r\nchange, by vitrifying them, glass itself, whether pure, or in the form\r\nof sand or flint, naturally, but by a slow and insensible progress,\r\nchanges into clay.\r\n\r\nWhere flint is the predominant stone, the country is generally strewed\r\nwith parts of it, and if the place is uncultivated, and these stones\r\nhave been long exposed to the air, without having been stirred, their\r\nupper superficies is always white, whereas the opposite side, which\r\ntouches the earth, is very brown, and preserves its natural colour. If\r\nthese flints are broken, we shall perceive that the whiteness is not\r\nonly external, but penetrates internally, and there forms a kind of\r\nband, not very deep in some, but which in others occupies almost the\r\nwhole flint. This white part is somewhat grainy, entirely opaque, as\r\nsoft as freestone, and adheres to the tongue like the boles; whereas the\r\nother part is smooth, has neither thread nor grain, and preserves its\r\nnatural colour, transparency, and hardness. If this flint is put into a\r\nfurnace, its white part becomes of a brick colour, and its brown part\r\nof a very fine white. Let us not say with one of our most celebrated\r\nnaturalists, that these stones are imperfect flints of different ages,\r\nwhich have not acquired their perfection; for why should they be all\r\nimperfect? Why should they be imperfect only on the side exposed to the\r\nweather? It, on the contrary, appears to me more reasonable that they\r\nare flints changed from their original state, gradually decomposed, and\r\nassuming the form and property of clay or bole. If this is thought to be\r\nonly conjecture, let the hardest and blackest flint be exposed to the\r\nweather, in less than a year its surface will change colour; and if we\r\nhave patience to pursue this experiment, we shall see it by degrees lose\r\nits hardness, transparency, and other specific characters, and approach\r\nevery day nearer and nearer the nature of clay.\r\n\r\nWhat happens to flint happens to sand; each grain of sand may possibly\r\nbe considered as a small flint, and each flint as a mass of extremely\r\nfine grains of sand. The first example of the decomposition of sand is\r\nfound in the brilliant opaque powder called Mica, in which clay and\r\nslate are always diffused. The entirely transparent flints, the Quartz,\r\nproduce, by decomposition, fat and soft talks, such as those of Venice\r\nand Russia, which are as ductile and vitrifiable as clay: and it appears\r\nto me, that talk is a mediate between glass, or transparent flint, and\r\nclay; whereas coarse and impure flint, by decomposing, passes to clay\r\nwithout any intermedium.\r\n\r\nOur factitious glass undergoes the same alterations: it decomposes and\r\nperishes, as it were, in the air. At first, it assumes a variety of\r\ncolours, then exfoliates, and by working it, we perceive brilliant\r\nscales fall off; but when its decomposition is more advanced, it\r\ncrumbles between the fingers, and is reduced into a very white fine\r\ntalky powder. Art has even imitated nature in the decomposition of glass\r\nand flint. \"Est etiam certa methodus solius aquæ communis ope, silices &\r\narenam in liquorem viscosum, eumdemque in sal viride convertendi, & hoc\r\nin aleum rubicundum, &c. Solius ignis & aqua ope, speciali experimento,\r\ndurissimos quosque lapides in mucorem resolvo, qui distillan subtilem\r\nspiritum exhibet & oleum nullus laudibus prœdicabile[218:A].\"\r\n\r\nThese matters more particularly belong to metals, and when we come to\r\nthem, shall be fully treated on, therefore we shall content ourselves\r\nhere with adding, that the different strata which cover the terrestrial\r\nglobe, being materials to be considered as actual vitrifications or\r\nanalogous to glass, and possessing its most essential qualities; and as\r\nit is evident, that from the decomposition of glass and flint, which is\r\nevery day made before our eyes, a genuine clay remains, it is not a\r\nprecarious supposition to advance, that clays and sands have been formed\r\nby scoria, and vitrified drops of the terrestrial globe, especially when\r\nwe join the proofs _a priori_, which we have given to evince the earth\r\nhas been in a state of liquefaction caused by fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[198:A] Essay on the Natural History of the Earth, pages 40, 41, 42, &c.\r\n\r\n[199:A] See Varennii, Geograph.

The quantity of\r\nthese marine productions is astonishing, and the number in many places\r\nso prodigious, that it appears scarcely possible that any should now\r\nremain in the sea; it is by considering this innumerable multitude of\r\nshells, that no doubt is left of our earth having been a long time under\r\nthe water of the ocean. The quantity found in a fossil, or petrified\r\nstate, is beyond conception, and it is only from the number of those\r\nthat have been discovered that we could possibly have formed an idea of\r\ntheir multiplicity. We must imagine, like those who reason on matters\r\nthey never saw, that shells are only found at random, dispersed here and\r\nthere, or in small heaps, as oyster shells thrown before our doors; on\r\nthe contrary, they form mountains, are met with in shoals of 100 or 200\r\nmiles length, nay, they may sometimes be traced through whole provinces\r\nin masses of 50 or 60 feet thick. It is from these circumstances alone\r\nthat we can reason on the subject.\r\n\r\nWe cannot give a more striking example on this subject than the shells\r\nof Touraine. The following is the description given of them by the\r\nhistorian of the Academy[220:A].\r\n\r\n\"The number of figured stones and fossil shells found in the bowels of\r\nthe earth were remarked in all ages and nations, but they were\r\nconsidered merely as the sports of nature, and even by philosophers\r\nthemselves, as the productions of chance or accident; they regarded them\r\nwith a degree of surprise, but passed them over with a slight attention,\r\nand all this phenomena perished without any fruit for the progress of\r\nknowledge. A potter in Paris, who knew neither Latin nor Greek, towards\r\nthe end of the 16th century, was the first man who dared affirm, in\r\nopposition to the learned, that the fossil shells were real shells\r\nformerly deposited by the sea in those places where they were found;\r\nthat animals, and particularly fish, had given to stones all these\r\ndifferent figures, &c. and he desired the whole school of Aristotle to\r\ncontradict his proofs. This was Bernard Palissy, as great a natural\r\ngenius as nature could form: his system slept near 100 years, and even\r\nhis name was almost forgot. At length the ideas of Palissy were revived\r\nin the mind of several philosophers; and science has profited by all the\r\nshells and figured stones the earth furnishes us with; perhaps they are\r\nat present become only too common, and the consequences drawn from them\r\ntoo incontestable.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding this, the observations presented by M. Reaumer must\r\nappear wonderful. He discovered a mass of 130 million, 680 thousand\r\ncubical fathoms of shells, either whole or in fragments, without any\r\nmixture of stone, earth, sand, or other extraneous matter: hitherto\r\nfossil shells have never appeared in such an enormous quantity, nor\r\nwithout mixture. It is in Touraine this prodigious mass is found, more\r\nthan 36 leagues from the sea; this is perfectly known there, as the\r\nfarmers of that province make use of these shells, which they dig up, as\r\nmanure for their lands, to fertilize their plains, which otherwise would\r\nbe absolutely sterile.\r\n\r\n\"What is dug from the earth, and which generally is no more than eight\r\nor nine feet deep, are only small fragments of shells, very\r\ndistinguishable as fragments, for they retain their original channels\r\nand hollows, having only lost their gloss and colour, as almost all\r\nshells do which we find in the earth. The smallest pieces, which are\r\nonly dust, are still distinguishable because they are perfectly of the\r\nsame matter as the rest, as well as of the whole shells which are\r\nsometimes found. We discover the species as well in the whole shells as\r\nin the larger fragments. Some of these species are known at Poictou,\r\nothers belong to more remote coasts. There are even fragments of\r\nmadrepores, coral, and other productions of the sea; all this matter in\r\nthe country is termed _Fallun_, and is found wherever the ground is dug\r\nin that province for the space of nine leagues square. The peasants do\r\nnot dig above twenty feet deep, because they think it would not repay\r\nthem for their trouble, but they are certainly deeper. The calculation\r\nof the quantity is however taken upon the supposition of only 18 feet\r\nand 2200 fathoms to the league. This mass of shells of course exceeds\r\nthe calculation, and possibly contains double the quantity.\r\n\r\n\"In physical points the smallest circumstances, which most people do not\r\nthink worthy of remarking, sometimes lead to consequences and afford\r\ngreat lights. M. de Reaumer observed, that all these fragments of shells\r\nlie horizontally, and hence he has concluded that this infinity of\r\nfragments does not proceed from the heap being formed at one time, or of\r\nwhole shells, for the uppermost, by their weight, would have crushed\r\nthe others, and of course their fallings would have given an infinity of\r\ndifferent positions. They must, therefore, have been brought there by\r\nthe sea, either whole or broken, and necessarily placed horizontal; and\r\nalthough the extreme length of time was of itself sufficient to break,\r\nand almost calcine the greatest part, it could not change their\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\"By this it appears, that they must have been brought gradually, and, in\r\nfact, how was it possible that the sea could convey at once such an\r\nimmense quantity of shells, and at the same time preserve a position\r\nperfectly horizontal? they must have collected in one spot, and\r\nconsequently this spot must have been the bottom of a gulph or basin.\r\n\r\n\"All this proves, that although there must remain upon the earth many\r\nvestiges of the universal deluge, as recorded in scripture, the mass of\r\nshells at Touraine was not produced by that deluge; there is perhaps not\r\nso great a mass in any part of the sea; but even had the deluge forced\r\nthem away, it would have been with an impetuosity and violence that\r\nwould not have permitted them to retain one uniform position. They must\r\nhave been brought and deposited gently and slowly, and consequently\r\ntheir accumulation required a space of time much longer than a year.\"\r\n\r\nThe surface of the earth, it is evident, must have been before or after\r\nthe deluge very differently disposed to what it is at present, that the\r\nsea and continent had another arrangement, and formerly there was a\r\ngreat gulph in the middle of Touraine. The changes which are known from\r\nhistory, or even ancient fable, are inconsiderable, but they give us\r\nroom to imagine those which a longer time might bring about. M. de\r\nReaumur supposes that Touraine was a gulph of the sea which communicated\r\nwith the ocean, and that the shells were carried there by a current; but\r\nthis is a simple conjecture laid down in room of the real unknown fact.\r\nTo speak with certainty on this matter, we should have geographical maps\r\nof all the places where shells have been dug from the earth, to obtain\r\nwhich would require almost an infinity of time and observation, yet it\r\nis possible that hereafter science may accomplish it.\r\n\r\nThis quantity of shells, considerable as it is, will astonish us less if\r\nwe consider the following circumstances: first, shell fish multiply\r\nprodigiously, and are full grown in a very short time; the abundance of\r\nindividuals in each kind proves to us their fertility. We have a strong\r\nexample of this increase in oysters, a mass of many fathoms of which are\r\nfrequently raised in a single day. In a very short time the rocks to\r\nwhich they are attached are considerably diminished, and some banks\r\nquite exhausted, nevertheless the ensuing year we find them as plentiful\r\nas before, nor do they appear to be in the least diminished; indeed I\r\nknow not whether a natural bed of oysters was ever entirely exhausted.\r\nSecondly, the substance of shells is analogous to stone; they are a long\r\ntime preserved in soft matters, and petrify readily in hard; these\r\nshells and marine productions therefore found on the earth, being the\r\nwrecks of many ages, must of course have formed very considerable\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nThere are a prodigious quantity of shells in marble, lime, stone, chalk,\r\nmarl, &c. we find them, as before observed, in hills and mountains, and\r\nthey often make more than one half of the bodies which contain them; for\r\nthe most part they appear well preserved, others are in fragments, but\r\nlarge enough to distinguish to what kind of shells they belong. Here our\r\nknowledge on this subject, from observation, finds its limits; but I\r\nshall go further and assert that shells are the intermedium which Nature\r\nadopts for the formation of most kind of stones; that chalks, marls, and\r\nlime-stone are composed only of the powder and pieces of shells; that\r\nconsequently the quantities of shells destroyed are infinitely more\r\nconsiderable than those preserved. I shall here content myself with\r\nindicating the point of view in which we ought to consider the strata of\r\nwhich the globe is composed. The first stratum is composed of the dust\r\nof the air, the sediment of the rain, dew, and vegetable or animal\r\nparts, reduced to particles; the strata of chalk, marl, lime, stone, and\r\nmarble, are composed of the ruins of shells, and other marine\r\nproductions, mixed with fragments or whole shells; but the vitrifiable\r\nsand or clay are the matters of which the internal parts of the globe\r\nare composed. They were vitrified when the globe received its form,\r\nwhich necessarily supposes that the matter was in fusion. The granate,\r\nrock, flint, &c. owe their origin to sand and clay, and are likewise\r\ndisposed by strata; but tuffa[227:A], free-stone, and flints (not in\r\ngreat masses), crystals, metals, pyrites, most minerals, sulphurs, &c.\r\nare matters whose formation is novel, in comparison with marbles,\r\ncalcinable stones, chalk, marl, and all other materials disposed in\r\nhorizontal strata, and which contain shells and other productions of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nAs the denominations I make use of may appear obscure or equivocal, it\r\nis necessary to explain them. By the term _clay_, I mean not only the\r\nwhite and yellow, but also blue, soft, hard, foliated, and other clays,\r\nwhich I look on as the scoria of glass, or as decomposed glass. By the\r\nword _sand_ I always understand vitrifiable sand; and not only\r\ncomprehend under this denomination the fine sand which produces\r\nfreestone, and which I look upon as powdered glass, or rather pumice\r\nstone, but also the sand which proceeds from the freestone destroyed by\r\nfriction, and also the larger sand, as small gravel, which proceeds from\r\nthe granate and rock-stone, and is sharp, angular, red, and commonly\r\nfound in the bed of rivers or rivulets that derive their waters\r\nimmediately from the higher mountains, or hills composed of stone or\r\ngranate. The river Armanson conveys a great quantity of this sand; it is\r\nlarge and brittle, and in fact is only fragments of rock-stone, as\r\ncalcinable gravel is of freestone. _Rock-stone_ and _granate_ are one\r\nand the same substance, but I have used both denominations, because\r\nthere are many persons who make two different species of them. It is the\r\nsame with respect to flints and free-stone in large pieces; I look on\r\nthem as kinds of granate, and I call them _large flints_, because they\r\nare disposed like calcinable stone in strata, and to distinguish them\r\nfrom the flints and free-stone in small masses, and the round flints\r\nwhich have no regular quarries, and whose beds have a certain extent;\r\nthese are of a modern formation, and have not the same origin as the\r\nflints and free-stone in large lumps, which are disposed in regular\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nI understand by the term _slate_, not only the blue, which all the world\r\nknows, but white, grey, and red slate: these bodies are generally met\r\nwith below laminated clay, and have every appearance of being nothing\r\nmore than clay hardened in this strata. Pit coal and jet are matters\r\nwhich also belong to clay, and are commonly under slate. By the word\r\n_tuffa_, I understood not only the common pumice which appears full of\r\nholes, and, as I may say, organized, but all the beds of stone made by\r\nthe sediment of running waters, all the stalactites, incrustations, and\r\nall kinds of stone that dissolve by fire. It is no ways doubtful that\r\nthese matters are not modern, and that they every day grow. Tuffa is\r\nonly a mass of lapidific matter in which we perceive no distinct strata:\r\nthis matter is disposed generally in small hollow cylinders, irregularly\r\ngrouped and formed by waters dropt at the foot of mountains, or on the\r\nslope of hills, which contain beds of marl or soft and calcareous earth;\r\nthese cylinders, which make one of the specific characters of this kind\r\nof tuffa, is either oblique or vertical according to the direction of\r\nthe streams or water which form them. These sort of spurious quarries\r\nhave no continuation; their extent is very confined, and proportionate\r\nto the height of the mountains which furnish them with the matter of\r\ntheir growth. The tuffa every day receiving lapidific juices, those\r\nsmall cylindrical columns, between which intervals are left, close at\r\nlast, and the whole becomes one compact body, but never acquires the\r\nhardness of stone, and is what Agricola terms _Marga tofocea fistulosa_.\r\nIn this tuffa are generally found impressions of leaves, trees, and\r\nplants, like those which grow in the environs: terrestrial shells also\r\nare often met with, but never any of the marine kind. The tuffa is\r\ncertainly therefore a new matter, which must be ranked with stalactites,\r\nincrustations, &c. all these new matters are kinds of spurious stones,\r\nformed at the expence of the rest, but which never arrive at true\r\npetrification.\r\n\r\nCrystal, precious stones, and all those which have a regular figure,\r\neven small flints formed by concentrical beds, whether found in\r\nperpendicular cavities of rocks, or elsewhere, are only exudations of\r\nlarge flints, or concrete juices of the like matters, and are therefore\r\nspurious stones, and real stalactites of flint or rock.\r\n\r\nShells are never found either in rock, granate, or free-stone, although\r\nthey are often met with in vitrifiable sand, from which these matters\r\nderive their origin; this seems to prove that sand cannot unite to form\r\nfree-stone or rock but when it is pure, and that if it is mixed with\r\nshells or substances of other kinds, which are heterogeneous to it, its\r\nunion is prevented. I have observed the little pebbles which are often\r\nfound in beds of sand mixed with shells, but never found any shell\r\ntherein: these pebbles are real concretions of free-stone formed in the\r\nsand in the places where it is not mixed with heterogeneous matters\r\nwhich oppose the formation of larger masses.\r\n\r\nWe have before observed, that at Amsterdam, which is a very low country,\r\nsea shells were found at 100 feet below the earth, and at\r\nMarly-la-Ville, six miles from Paris, at 75 feet; we likewise meet with\r\nthe same at the bottom of mines, and in banks of rocks, beneath a height\r\nof stone 50, 100, 200, and 1000 feet thick, as is apparent in the Alps\r\nand Pyrennees, where, in the lower beds, shells and other marine\r\nproductions are constantly found. But to proceed in order, we find\r\nshells on the mountains of Spain, France, and England; in all the marble\r\nquarries of Flanders, in the mountains of Gueldres, in all hills around\r\nParis, Burgundy, and Champagne; in one word, in every place where the\r\nbasis of the soil is not free-stone or tuffa; and in most of these\r\nplaces there are more shells than other matters in the substance of the\r\nstones. By _shells_, I mean not only the wrecks of shell-fish, but those\r\nof crustaceous animals, the bristles of sea hedge-hogs, and all\r\nproductions of the sea insects, as coral, madrepores, astroites, &c. We\r\nmay easily be convinced by inspection, that in most calculable stones\r\nand marble, there is so great a quantity of these marine productions\r\nthat they appear to surpass the matter which unites them.\r\n\r\nBut let us proceed; we meet with these marine productions even on the\r\ntops of the highest mountains; for example, on Mount Cenis, in the\r\nmountains of Genes, in the Apennines, and in most of the stone and\r\nmarble quarries in Italy; also in the stones of the most ancient\r\nedifices of the Romans; in the mountains of Tirol; in the centre of\r\nItaly, on the summits of Mount Paterne, near Bologna; in the hills of\r\nCalabria; in many parts of Germany and Hungary, and generally in all the\r\nhigh parts of Europe[233:A].\r\n\r\nIn Asia and Africa, travellers have remarked them in several parts; for\r\nexample, on the mountains of Castravan, above Barut, there is a bed of\r\nwhite stone as thin as slate, each leaf of which contains a great number\r\nand diversity of fishes; they lie for the most part very flat and\r\ncompressed, as does the fossil fearn-plants, but they are\r\nnotwithstanding so well preserved, that the smallest traces of the fins,\r\nscales, and all the parts which distinguish each kind of fish, are\r\nperfectly visible. So likewise we find many sea muscles, and petrified\r\nshells between Suez and Cairo, and on all the hills and eminences of\r\nBarbary; the greatest part are conformable to the kinds at present\r\ncaught in the Red Sea[234:A]. In Europe, we meet with petrified fish in\r\nSweden and Germany, and in the quarry of Oningen, &c.\r\n\r\nThe long chain of mountains, says Bourguet, which extends from Portugal\r\nto the most eastern parts of China, the mountains of Africa and America,\r\nand the vallies of Europe, all inclose stones filled with shell-fish,\r\nand from hence, he says, we may conclude the same of all the other parts\r\nof the world unknown to us.\r\n\r\nThe islands in Europe, Asia, and America, where men have had occasion to\r\ndig, whether in mountains or plains, furnish examples of fossil shells,\r\nwhich evince that they have that in common with the bordering\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nHere then is sufficient facts to prove that sea shells, petrified fish,\r\nand other marine productions are to be found in almost every place we\r\nare disposed to seek them.\r\n\r\n\"It is certain, says an English author (Tancred Robinson), that there\r\nhave been sea-shells dispersed on the earth by armies, and the\r\ninhabitants of towns and villages, and that Loubere relates in his\r\nVoyage to Siam, that the monkies of the Cape of Good Hope, continually\r\namuse themselves with carrying shells from the sea shores to the tops of\r\nthe mountains; but that cannot resolve the question, why these shells\r\nare dispersed over all the earth, and even in the interior parts of\r\nmountains, where they are deposited in beds like those in the bottom of\r\nthe sea.\"\r\n\r\nOn reading an Italian letter on the changes happened to the terrestrial\r\nglobe, printed at Paris in the year 1746, I was surprised to find these\r\nsentiments of Loubere exactly corresponded. Petrified fish, according to\r\nthis writer, are only fish rejected from the Roman tables, because they\r\nwere not esteemed wholesome; and with respect to fossil-shells, he says\r\nthe pilgrims of Syria brought, during the times of the Crusades, those\r\nof the Levant Sea, into France, Italy, and other Christian states; why\r\nhas he not added that it was the monkies who transported the shells to\r\nthe tops of these mountains, which were never inhabited by men? This\r\nwould not have spoiled but rendered his explanation still more\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\nHow comes it that enlightened persons, who pique themselves on\r\nphilosophy, have such various ideas on this subject? But doing so, we\r\nshall not content ourselves with having said that petrified shells are\r\nfound in almost every part of the earth which has been dug, nor with\r\nhaving related the testimonies of authors of natural history; as it\r\nmight be suspected, that with a view of some system, they perceived\r\nshells where there were none; but quote the authority of some authors,\r\nwho merely remarked them accidentally, and whose observations went no\r\nfarther than recognising those that were whole and in the best\r\npreservation. Their testimony will perhaps be of a still greater\r\nauthority with people who have it not in their power to be assured of\r\nthe truth of these facts, and who know not the difference between shells\r\nand petrifications.\r\n\r\nAll the world may see the banks of shells in the hills in the environs\r\nof Pans, especially in the quarries of stone, as at Chaussée, near Séve,\r\nat Issy, Passy, and elsewhere. We find a great quantity of lenticular\r\nstones at Villers-Cotterets; these rocks are entirely formed thereof,\r\nand they are blended without any order with a kind of stony mortar,\r\nwhich binds them together. At Chaumont so great a quantity of petrified\r\nshells are found that the hills appear to be composed of nothing else.\r\nIt is the same at Courtagnon, near Rheims, where there is a bank of\r\nshells near four leagues broad, and whose length is considerably more. I\r\nmention these places as being famous and striking the eye of every\r\nbeholder.\r\n\r\nWith respect to foreign countries, here follows the observations of some\r\ntravellers:\r\n\r\n\"In Syria and Phœnicia, the rocks, particularly in the neighbourhood\r\nof Latikea, are a kind of chalky substance, and it is perhaps from\r\nthence that the city has taken the name of the white promontory.\r\nNakoura, anciently termed Scala Tyriorum, or the Tyrians Ladder, is\r\nnearly of the same nature, and we still find there, by digging,\r\nquantities of all sorts of shells, corals, and other remains of the\r\ndeluge[237:A].\"\r\n\r\nOn mount Sinai, we find only a few fossil shells, and other marks of the\r\ndeluge, at least if we do not rank the fossil Tarmarin of the\r\nneighbouring mountains of Siam among this number, perhaps the first\r\nmatter of which their marble is formed, had a corrosive virtue not\r\nproper to preserve them. But at Corondel, where the rocks approach\r\nnearer our free-stone, I found many shells, as also a very singular sea\r\nmuscle, of the descoid kind, but closer and rounder. The ruins of the\r\nlittle village Ain le Mousa, and many canals which conduct the water\r\nthereto, furnish numbers of fossil shells. The ancient walls of Suez,\r\nand what yet remains of its harbour, have been constructed of the same\r\nmaterials, which seem to have been taken from the same quarry. Between,\r\nas well as on all the mountains, eminences and hills of Lybia, near\r\nEgypt, we meet with a great quantity of sea weed, as well as vivalvous\r\nshells, and of these which terminate in a point, most of which are\r\nexactly conformable to the kinds at present caught in the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nThe moving sand in the neighbourhood of Ras Sem, in the kingdom of\r\nBarca, covers many palm trees with petrifications. Ras Sem signifies the\r\nhead of a fish, and is what we term the petrified village, where it is\r\nsaid men, women, and children are found, who with their cattle,\r\nfurniture, &c. have been converted into stone; but these, says Shaw, are\r\nvain tales and fables, as I have not only learnt from M. le Maire, who\r\nat the time he was Consul at Tripoly, sent several persons thither to\r\ntake cognizance of it, but also from very respectable persons who had\r\nbeen at those places.\r\n\r\nNear the pyramids certain pieces of stone worked by the sculptor, were\r\nfound by Mr. Shaw, and among these stones many rude ones of the figure\r\nand size of lentils; some even resemble barley half-peeled; these, he\r\nsays, were reported to be the remains of what the workmen ate, but which\r\ndoes not appear probable, &c. These lentils and barley are nothing but\r\npetrified shells called by naturalists lentil stones.\r\n\r\nAccording to Misson, several sorts of these shell-fish are found in the\r\nenvirons of Maestricht, especially towards the village of Zicken, or\r\nTichen, and at the little mountain called Huns. In the environs of\r\nSienna, near Ceraldo, are many mountains of sand crammed with divers\r\nsorts of shells. Montemario, a mile from Rome, is entirely filled with\r\nthem; I have seen them in the Alps, France, and elsewhere. Olearius,\r\nSteno, Cambden, Speed, and a number of other authors, as well ancient as\r\nmodern, relate the same phenomena.\r\n\r\n\"The island of Cerigo, says Thevenot, was anciently called Porphyris,\r\nfrom the quantity of Porphyry which was taken out of it[240:A].\r\n\r\n\"Opposite the village of Inchene, and on the eastern shore of the Nile,\r\nI found petrified plants, which grow naturally in a space about two\r\nleagues long, by a very moderate breadth; this is one of the most\r\nsingular productions of nature. These plants resemble the white coral\r\nfound in the Red Sea[240:B].\"\r\n\r\n\"There are petrifications of divers kinds on Mount Libanus, and among\r\nothers flat stones, where the skeletons of fish are found well preserved\r\nand entire; red chesnuts and small branches of coral, the same as grow\r\nin the Red Sea, are also found on this mountain.\"\r\n\r\n\"On Mount Carmel we find a great quantity of hollow stones, which have\r\nsomething of the figure of melons, peaches, and other fruits, which are\r\nsaid to be so petrified: they are commonly sold to pilgrims, not only as\r\nmere curiosities, but also as remedies against many disorders. The\r\nolives which are the _lapides jadaici_, are to be met with at the\r\ndruggists, and have always been looked upon, when dissolved in the\r\njuice of lemon, as a specific for the stone and gravel.\"\r\n\r\n\"M. la Roche, a physician, gave me some of these petrified olives, which\r\ngrew in great plenty in these mountains, where I am told are found other\r\nstones, the inside of which perfectly resemble the natural parts of men\r\nand women. These are Hysterolithes.\"\r\n\r\n\"In going from Smyrna to Tauris, when we were at Tocat, says Tavernier,\r\nthe heat was so great, as obliged us to quit the common road, and go by\r\nthe mountains, where there is constantly shade and refreshing air. In\r\nmany places we found snow and a quantity of very fine sorrel, and on the\r\ntop of some of those mountains we found shells like those upon the sea\r\nshores, which was very extraordinary.\"\r\n\r\nHere follows what Olearius says on the subject of petrified shells,\r\nwhich he remarked in Persia, and in the rocks where the sepulchres are\r\ncut out, near to the village of Pyrmaraus:\r\n\r\n\"We were three in company that ascended to the top of the rock by the\r\nmost frightful precipices, mutually assisting each other; having gained\r\nthe summit, we found four large chambers, and within many niches cut in\r\nthe rocks to serve for beds: but what the most surprised us was to find\r\nin this vault, on the top of the mountain, muscle shells; and in some\r\nplaces they were in such great quantities, that the whole rock appeared\r\nto be composed only of sand and shells. Returning to Persia, we\r\nperceived many of these shelly mountains along the coast of the Caspian\r\nsea.\"\r\n\r\nTo these I could subjoin many other authorities which I suppress, not\r\nwilling to tire those who have no need of superabundant proofs, and who\r\nare convinced by their sight, as I have been, of the existence of shells\r\nwherever we chuse to seek for them.\r\n\r\nIn France, we not only find the shells of the French coast, but also\r\nsuch as have never been seen in those seas. Some philosophers assert,\r\nthat the quantity of these foreign petrified shells is much greater than\r\nthose of our climate; but I think this opinion unfounded; for,\r\nindependent of the shell-fish which inhabit the bottom of the sea, and\r\nare seldom brought up by the fishermen, and which consequently may be\r\nlooked on as foreigners, although they exist in our seas, I see, by\r\ncomparing the petrifactions with the living analagous animals, there\r\nare more of those of our coasts than of others: for example, most of the\r\ncockles, muscles, oysters, ear-shells, limpets, nautili, stars,\r\ntubulites, corals, madrepores, &c. found in so many places, are\r\ncertainly the productions of our seas; and though a great number appear\r\nwhich are foreign or unknown, the cornu ammonis, the lapides juduica,\r\n&c. yet I am convinced, from repeated observations, that the number of\r\nthese kinds is small in comparison with the shells of our own coasts:\r\nbesides, what composes the bottom of almost all our marble and\r\nlime-stone but madrepores, astroites, and all those other productions\r\nwhich are formed by sea insects, and formerly called marine plants?\r\nShells, however abundant, form only a small part of these productions,\r\nmany of which originate in our seas, and particularly in the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe Red sea produces corals, madrepores, and marine plants in the\r\ngreatest abundance: no part furnishes a greater variety than the port of\r\nTor; in calm weather so great a quantity present themselves, that the\r\nbottom of the sea resembles a forest; some of the branched madrepores\r\nare eight or ten feet high. In the Mediterranean sea, at Marseilles,\r\nnear the coasts of Italy and Sicily; in most of the gulphs of the\r\nocean, around islands, on banks, and in all temperate climates, where\r\nthe sea is but of a moderate depth, they are very common.\r\n\r\nM. Peyssonel was the first who discovered that corals, madrepores, &c.\r\nowed their origin to animals, and were not plants as had been supposed.\r\nThe observation of M. Peyssonel was a long time doubted; some\r\nnaturalists, at first, rejected it with a kind of disdain, nevertheless\r\nthey have been obliged since to acknowledge its truth, and the whole\r\nworld is at length satisfied that these formerly supposed marine plants,\r\nare nothing but hives or cells formed by insects, in which they live as\r\nfish do in their shells. These bodies were, at first, placed in the\r\nclass of minerals, then passed into that of vegetables, and now remain\r\nfixed in that of animals, the genuine operations of which they must ever\r\nbe considered.\r\n\r\nThere are shell-fish which live at the bottom of the sea, and which are\r\nnever cast on the shore; authors call them Pelogiæ, to distinguish them\r\nfrom the others which they call Litterales. It is to be supposed the\r\ncornu ammonis, and some other kinds that are only found in a petrified\r\nstate, belong to the former, and that they were filled with the stony\r\nsediment in the very places they are found. There might also have been\r\ncertain animals, whose species are perished, and of which number this\r\nshell-fish might be ranked. The extraordinary fossil bones found in\r\nSiberia, Canada, Ireland, and many other places, seem to confirm this\r\nconjecture, for no animal has hitherto been discovered to whom such\r\nbones could belong, as they are, for the most part, of an enormous size.\r\n\r\nThese shells, according to Woodward, are met with from the top to the\r\nbottom of quarries, pits, and at the bottom of the deepest mines of\r\nHungary. And Mr. Ray assures us, they are found a thousand feet deep in\r\nthe rocks which border the isle of Calda, and in Pembrokeshire in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nShells are not only found in a petrified state, at great depths, and at\r\nthe tops of the highest mountains, but there are some met with in their\r\nnatural condition, and which have the gloss, colours, and lightness of\r\nsea-shells; and to convince ourselves entirely of this matter, we have\r\nonly to compare them with those found on the sea shores. A slight\r\nexamination will prove that these fossil and petrified shells are the\r\nsame as those of the sea; they are marked with the same articulations\r\nand in the glossopetri, and other teeth of fishes, which are sometimes\r\nfound adhering to the jaw-bone, the teeth of the fish are remarked to be\r\nsmooth and worn at the extremities, and that they have been made use of\r\nwhen the animals were alive.\r\n\r\nAlmost every where on land we meet with fossil-shells, and of those of\r\nthe same kind, some are small, others large, some young, others old;\r\nsome imperfect, others extremely perfect and we likewise sometimes see\r\nthe young ones adhering to the old.\r\n\r\nThe shell-fish called _purpura_ has a long tongue, the extremity of\r\nwhich is bony, and so sharp, that it pierces the shells of other fish;\r\nby which means it draws nutriment from them. Shells pierced in this\r\nmanner are frequently found in the earth, which is an incontestible\r\nproof that they formerly inclosed living fish, and existed in those\r\nparts where there were the Purpura.\r\n\r\nThe obelisks of St. Peter's at Rome, according to John of Latran, were\r\nsaid to come from the pyramids of Egypt; they are of red granite, which\r\nis a kind of rock-stone, and, as we have observed, contains no shells;\r\nbut the African and Egyptian marble, and the porphyry said to have been\r\ncut from the temple of Solomon, and the palaces of the kings of Egypt,\r\nand used at Rome in different buildings, are filled with shells. Red\r\nporphyry is composed of an infinite number of prickles of the species of\r\nechinus, or sea chesnut; they are placed pretty near each other, and\r\nform all the small white spots which are in the porphyry. Each of these\r\nwhite spots has a black one in its centre, which is the section of the\r\nlongitudinal tube of the prickles of the echinus. At Fichen, three\r\nleagues from Dijon, in Burgundy, is a red stone perfectly similar in its\r\ncomposition to porphyry, and which differs from it only in hardness, not\r\nbeing more so than marble; it appears almost formed of prickles of the\r\nechini, and its beds are of a very great extent. Many beautiful pieces\r\nof workmanship have been made of it in this province, and particularly\r\nthe steps of the pedestal of the equestrian statue of Louis le Grand, at\r\nDijon.\r\n\r\nThis species of stone is also found at Montbard, in Burgundy, where\r\nthere is an extensive quarry; it is not so hard as marble, contains more\r\nof the echini, and less of the red matter. From this it appears that\r\nthe ancient porphyry of Egypt differs only from that of Burgundy in the\r\ndegree of hardness, and the number of the points of the echini.\r\n\r\nWith respect to what the curious call green porphyry, I rather suppose\r\nit to be a granite than a porphyry; it is not composed of spots like the\r\nred porphyry, and its substance appears to be similar to that of a\r\ncommon granite. In Tuscany, in the stone with which the ancient walls of\r\nVolatera were built, there are a great quantity of shells, and this wall\r\nwas built 2500 years ago. Most marbles, porphyries, and other stones of\r\nthe most ancient buildings, contain shells and other wrecks of marine\r\nproductions, as well as the marble we at present take from the quarry;\r\ntherefore it cannot be doubted, independent even of the sacred testimony\r\nof holy writ, that before the deluge the earth was composed of the same\r\nmaterials at it is at present.\r\n\r\nFrom all these facts it is plain that petrified shells are found in\r\nEurope, Asia, Africa, and in every place where the observations have\r\nbeen made; they are also found in America, in the Brasils; for example,\r\nin Tucumama, in Terra Magellinica, and in such a great quantity in the\r\nAntilles, that directly below the cultivable land, the bottom of which\r\nthe inhabitants call lime, is nothing but a composition of shells,\r\nmadrepores, astroites, and other productions of the sea. These facts\r\nwould have made me think that shells and other petrified marine\r\nproductions were to be found in the greatest part of the continent of\r\nAmerica, and especially in the mountains, as Woodward asserts; but M.\r\nCondamine, who lived several years at Peru, has assured me he could not\r\ndiscover any in the Cordeliers, although he had carefully sought for\r\nthem. This exception would be singular, and the consequences that might\r\nbe drawn from it would be still more so; but I own that, in spite of the\r\ntestimony of this celebrated naturalist, I am much inclined to suppose,\r\nthat in the mountains of Peru, as well as elsewhere, there are shells\r\nand other marine petrifications, although they have not been discovered.\r\nIt is well known, that in matter of testimonies, two positive witnesses,\r\nwho assert to have seen a thing, is sufficient to make a complete proof;\r\nwhereas ten thousand negative witnesses, and who can only assert not to\r\nhave seen a thing, can only raise a slight doubt. This reason, united\r\nwith the strength of analogy, induces me to persist in thinking the\r\nshells will be found on the mountains of Peru, especially if we search\r\nfor them on the rise of the mountain, and not at the summit.\r\n\r\nThe tops of the highest mountains are generally composed of rock, stone\r\ngranite, and other vitrifiable matters, which contain no shells.\r\n\r\nAll these matters were formed out of the beds of the sand of the sea,\r\nwhich covered the tops of these mountains. When the sea left them, the\r\nsand and other light bodies were carried by the waters into the plains,\r\nso that there remained only rocks on the tops of the mountains, which\r\nhad been formed under those beds of sand. At two, three, or four hundred\r\nfathoms below the tops of these mountains, are often found marble and\r\nother calcinable matter, which are disposed in parallel strata, and\r\ncontain shells and other marine productions; therefore it is not\r\nsurprising that M. de la Condamine did not find any shells on these\r\nmountains, especially if he sought for them in the elevated parts of\r\nthose mountains which are composed of rock, free-stone, or vitrifiable\r\nsand; but had he examined the lower parts of the Cordeliers, he would\r\nundoubtedly have found strata of stone, marble, earth, &c. mixed with\r\nshells; for in every country where observations have been made, such\r\nbeds have always been met with.\r\n\r\nBut suppose that in fact there are no marine productions in the\r\nmountains of Peru, all that may be concluded from it will no ways affect\r\nour theory; and it might be possible, that there are some parts of the\r\nglobe which never were covered with water, especially of such elevation\r\nas the Cordeliers. But in this case there might be some curious\r\nobservations made on those mountains, for they would not be composed of\r\nparallel strata, the materials also would be very different from those\r\nwe are acquainted with; they would not have perpendicular cracks; the\r\ncomposition of the rocks and stones would not at all resemble those of\r\nother countries; and lastly, in these mountains we should find the\r\nancient structure of the earth such as it originally was before it was\r\nchanged by the motion of the waters; we should see the first state of\r\nthe globe, the old matters of which it was composed, its form, and the\r\nnatural arrangement of its parts; but this is too much to expect, and on\r\ntoo slight foundations; and it is more conformable to reason to conclude\r\nthat fossil-shells are to be found in those mountains, as well as in\r\nevery other place.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the manner in which shells are placed in the strata of\r\nearth or sand, Woodward says, \"All shells that are met with in an\r\ninfinity of strata of earth, and banks of rocks, in the highest\r\nmountains, and in the deepest quarries and mines, in flints, &c. &c. in\r\nmasses of sulphur, marcasites, and other metallic and mineral bodies,\r\nare filled with similar substances to that which includes them, and\r\nnever any heterogeneous matter, &c.\r\n\r\n\"In the sand stones of all countries (the specific weight of the\r\ndifferent kinds of which vary but little, being generally with respect\r\nto water as 2-1/2 or 9/16 to 1), we find only the conchae, and other\r\nshells which are nearly of the same weight, but they are usually found\r\nin very great numbers, whereas it is very rare to meet with\r\noyster-shells (whose specific weight is but as 2-1/3 to 1), or sea\r\ncockles (whose weight is but as 2 or 2-1/8 to 1), or other sorts of\r\nlighter shells; but on the contrary in chalk, (which is lighter than\r\nstone, being to water but as 2-1/10 to 1), we find only cockles and\r\nother kinds of lighter shells, page 32, 33.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be remarked, that what Woodward says in this place with respect\r\nto specific gravity, must not be looked upon as a general rule, for we\r\nfind lighter and heavier shells in the same matters; for example, shells\r\nof cockles, of oysters, of echini, &c. are found in the same stones and\r\nearth; and even in the royal cabinet may be seen a petrified cockle in a\r\ncornelian, and echini petrified in an agate, &c. therefore the specific\r\nweight of the shells has not influenced so much as Woodward supposes\r\ntheir position in the earth. The reason why such light shells are found\r\nmore abundantly in chalk is, that chalk is only the ruinated part of\r\nshells, and that those of the echini being lighter and thinner than\r\nothers, would have been most easily reduced into powder or chalk, so\r\nthat the strata of chalk are only met with in the places where formerly\r\na great abundance of these light shells were collected, the destruction\r\nof which formed that chalk, in which we find those shells, which having\r\nresisted the frictions, are preserved entire, or at least in parts large\r\nenough to discover their species.\r\n\r\nBut this subject is treated more fully in our discourse on minerals; we\r\nshall here content ourselves with saying, that a modification must be\r\ngiven to Woodward's expressions: he seems to say, that shells are found\r\nin flints, cornelians, in ores, and sulphur, as often, and in as great\r\na number as in other matters; whereas the truth is, that they are very\r\nrare in all vitrifiable or purely inflammable substances; and, on the\r\ncontrary, are in prodigious abundance in chalk, marl, and marbles,\r\ninsomuch that we cannot absolutely pretend to say, that the lightest and\r\nheaviest shells are found in corresponding strata, but only that in\r\ngeneral they are oftener found so than otherwise. They are all filled\r\nwith the substance which surrounds them, whether found in horizontal\r\nstrata or in perpendicular fissures, because both have been formed by\r\nthe waters, although at different times and in different manners. Those\r\nfound in horizontal strata of stone, marble, &c. have been deposited by\r\nthe motion of the waves of the sea, and those in flints, cornelians, and\r\nall matters which are in the perpendicular fissures, have been produced\r\nby the particular motion of a small quantity of water, loaded with\r\nlapidific or metallic substances. In both cases these matters were\r\nreduced into a fine and impalpable powder, which has filled the shells\r\nso fully and absolutely, as not to have left the least vacuum.\r\n\r\nThere is therefore in stone, marble, &c. a great multitude of shells\r\nwhich are whole, beautiful, and so little changed, that they may be\r\neasily compared with the shells preserved in cabinets, or found on the\r\nsea shores.\r\n\r\nWoodward, in pages 23 and 24, proceeds, \"There are, besides these, great\r\nmultitudes of shells contained in stones, &c. which are entire and\r\nabsolutely free from any such mineral mixture; which may be compared\r\nwith those at this time seen on our shores, and which will be found not\r\nto have any difference, being precisely of the same figure and size; of\r\nthe same substance and texture as the peculiar matter which composes\r\nthem is the same, and is disposed and arranged in the same manner; the\r\ndirection of their fibres and spiral lines are the same, the composition\r\nof the small lama formed by their fibres is the same in the one as the\r\nother; we see in the same part vestigia of tendons, by means of which\r\nthe animal was fastened and joined to its shell; we see the same\r\ntubercles, stria and pipes; in short, the whole is alike, whether within\r\nor without the shell, in its cavity or on its convexity, in its\r\nsubstance or on its superficies. In other respects these fossil\r\nshell-fish are subject to the same common accidents as those of the sea;\r\nfor example, they sometimes grow to one another, the least are adherent\r\nto the large; they have vermicular conduits; pearls are found therein,\r\nand other similar matters which have been produced by the animal when it\r\ninhabited its shell; and what is very considerable, their specific\r\ngravity is exactly the same as that of their kind found actually in the\r\nsea; in all chymical experiments they answer exactly with sea-shells;\r\nwhen dissolved they have the same appearance, smell and taste; in a\r\nword, their resemblance is perfectly exact.\"\r\n\r\nI have often observed with astonishment, as I have already said, whole\r\nmountains, chains of rocks, enormous banks of quarries, so full of\r\nshells and other wrecks of marine productions, that their bulk surpassed\r\nthat of the matter in which they were deposited.\r\n\r\nI have seen cultivated fields so full of petrified cockles that a man\r\nmight pick them up with his eyes shut, others covered with cornu\r\nammonis, and some with cardites; and the more we examine the earth, the\r\nmore we shall be convinced that the number of these petrifications is\r\ninfinite, and conclude, that it is impossible that all the animals which\r\ninhabited these shells existed at one time.\r\n\r\nI have made an observation, that in all countries where we find a very\r\ngreat number of petrified shells in the cultivated lands which are\r\nwhole, well preserved, and totally apart, have been divided by the\r\naction of the frost, which destroys the stone and suffers the petrified\r\nshells to subsist a longer time.\r\n\r\nThis immense quantity of marine fossils found in so many places, proves\r\nthat they could not have been transported thither by the deluge; for if\r\nthese shells had been brought on the earth by a deluge, the greatest\r\npart would have remained on the surface of the earth, or at least would\r\nnot have entered to the depth of seven or eight hundred feet in the most\r\nsolid marble.\r\n\r\nIn all quarries these shells form a share of the internal part of the\r\nstone, sometimes externally covered with stalactites, which is much less\r\nancient matter than stone, which contains shells. Another proof this\r\nhappened not by a deluge is, that bones, horns, claws, &c. of land\r\nanimals, are found but very rarely, and not at all in marble and other\r\nhard stone whereas if it was the effect of a deluge, where all must have\r\nperished, we should meet with the remains of land animals as well as\r\nthose of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is a vain supposition to pretend that all the earth was dissolved at\r\nthe deluge, nor can we give any foundation to such idea, but by\r\nsupposing a second miracle, to give the water the property of a\r\nuniversal dissolvent. Besides, what annihilates the supposition, and\r\nrenders it even contradictory, is, that if all matters were dissolved by\r\nthat water, yet shells have not been so, since we find them entire and\r\nwell preserved in all the masses which are said to have been dissolved;\r\nthis evidently proves that there never was such dissolution, and that\r\nthe arrangement of the parallel strata was not made in an instant, but\r\nby successive sediments: for it is evident to all who will take the\r\ntrouble of observing, that the arrangement of all the materials which\r\ncompose the globe, is the work of the waters. The question therefore is\r\nonly whether this arrangement was made at once, or in a length of time:\r\nnow we have shewn it could not be done all at once, because the\r\nmaterials have not kept the order of specific weight, and there has not\r\nbeen a general dissolution; therefore this arrangement must have been\r\nproduced by sediments deposited in succession of time; any other\r\nrevolution, motion, or cause, would have produced a very different\r\narrangement. Besides, particular revolutions, or accidental causes,\r\ncould not have produced a similar effect on the whole globe.\r\n\r\nLet us see what the historian of the Academy says on this subject anno\r\n1718, p. 3. \"The numerous remains of extensive inundations, and the\r\nmanner in which we must conceive mountains to have been formed,\r\nsufficiently proves that great revolutions have happened to the surface\r\nof the earth. As far as we have been able to penetrate we find little\r\nelse but ruins, wrecks, and vast bodies heaped up together and\r\nincorporated into one mass, without the smallest appearance of order or\r\ndesign. If there is some kind of regular organization in the terrestrial\r\nglobe it is deeper than we have been able to examine, and all our\r\nresearches must terminate in digging among the ruins of the external\r\ncoat, but which will still find sufficient employment for our\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\n\"M. de Jussieu found in the environs of St. Chaumont a great quantity of\r\nslaty or foliated stones, every foliage of which was marked with the\r\nimpression of a branch, a leaf, or the fragment of a leaf of some plant:\r\nthe representations of leaves were exactly extended, as if they had been\r\ncarefully spread on the stone by the hand; this proves they had been\r\nbrought thither by the water, which always keeps leaves in that state:\r\nthey were in different situations, sometimes two or three together. It\r\nmay easily be supposed that a leaf deposited by water upon soft mud, and\r\nafterwards covered with another layer of mud, imprints on the upper the\r\nimage of one of its two surfaces, and on the under the image of the\r\nother; and on being hardened and petrified would appear to have taken\r\ndifferent impressions; but, however natural this supposition may be, the\r\nfact is not so, for the two laminæ of stone bear impressions of the same\r\nside of the leaf, the one in alto, the other in bas releaf. It was M.\r\nJussieu who made these observations on the figured stones of St.\r\nChaumont; to him we shall leave the explication, and pass to objects\r\nwhich are more general and interesting.\r\n\r\n\"All the impressions on the stones of St. Chaumont are of foreign\r\nplants; they are not to be found in any part of France, but only in the\r\nEast Indies or the hot climates of America; they are for the most part\r\ncapillary plants, generally of the species of fern, whose hard and\r\ncompact coat renders them more able to imprint and preserve themselves.\r\nSome leaves of Indian plants imprinted on the stones of Germany appeared\r\nastonishing to M. Leibnitz, but here we find the same wonderful affair\r\ninfinitely multiplied. There even seems in this respect to be an\r\nunaccountable destination of nature, for in all the stones of St.\r\nChaumont not a single plant of the country has been found.\r\n\r\n\"It is certain, by the number of fossil-shells in the quarries and\r\nmountains, that this country, as well as many others, must have formerly\r\nbeen covered with the sea. But how has the American or Indian sea\r\nreached thither? To explain this, and many other wonderful phenomena, it\r\nmay be supposed, with much probability, that the sea originally covered\r\nthe whole terrestrial globe: but this supposition will not hold good,\r\nbecause how were terrestrial plants to exist? It evidently, therefore,\r\nmust have been great inundations which have conveyed the plants of one\r\ncountry into the others.\r\n\r\n\"M. de Jussieu thinks, that as the bed of the sea is continually rising,\r\nin consequence of the mud and sand which the rivers incessantly convey\r\nthere, the sea, at first confined between natural dykes, surmounted\r\nthem, and was dispersed over the land, and that the dykes were\r\nthemselves undermined by the waters and overthrown therein. In the\r\nearliest time of the formation of the earth, when no one thing had taken\r\na regular form, prodigious and sudden revolutions might then have been\r\nmade, of which we no longer have examples, because the whole is now in\r\nsuch a permanent state, that the changes must be inconsiderable and by\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\n\"By some of these great revolutions the East and West Indian seas may\r\nhave been driven to Europe, and carried with them foreign plants\r\nfloating on its waters, which they tore up in their road, and deposited\r\ngently in places where the water was but shallow and would soon\r\nevaporate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[220:A] Anno 1720; page 5.\r\n\r\n[227:A] A kind of soft gravelly stone.\r\n\r\n[233:A] On this subject see Stenon, Ray, Woodward, and others.\r\n\r\n[234:A] See Shaw's Voyages, Vol. ii, pages 40 and 41.\r\n\r\n[237:A] See Shaw's Travels.\r\n\r\n[240:A] Thevenot, Vol. I, page 25.\r\n\r\n[240:B] Voyage of Paul Lucus, Vol. II, page 380.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE IX.\r\n\r\nON THE INEQUALITIES OF THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inequalities which are on the surface of the earth, and which might\r\nbe regarded as an imperfection to its figure, are necessary to preserve\r\nvegetation and life on the terrestrial globe. To be assured of this, it\r\nis only requisite to conceive what the earth would be if it was even and\r\nregular. Instead of agreeable hills, from whence pure streams of waters\r\nflow, to support the verdure of the earth; instead of those rich and\r\nflourishing meadows, where plants and animals find agreeable\r\nsubsistence; a dismal sea would cover the whole globe, and the earth,\r\ndeprived of all its valuable qualities, would only remain an obscure and\r\nforsaken planet, at best only destined for the abode of fishes.\r\n\r\nBut independent of moral considerations, which seldom form a proof in\r\nphilosophy, there is a physical necessity why the earth must be\r\nirregular on its surface; for supposing it was perfectly regular in its\r\norigin, the motion of the waters, the subterraneous fires, the wind, and\r\nother external causes, would, in course of time, have necessarily\r\nproduced irregularities similar to those now seen.\r\n\r\nThe greatest inequalities next to the elevations of mountains, are the\r\ndepths of the ocean; this depth is very different even at great\r\ndistances from land; it is said there are parts above a league deep, but\r\nthose are few, and the most general depths are from 60 to 150 fathoms.\r\nThe gulphs bordering on the coasts are much less deep, and the straits\r\nare generally the most shallow.\r\n\r\nTo sound the depths of the sea, a piece of lead of 30 or 40lb. is made\r\nuse of, fastened to a small cord; this is a good method for common\r\ndepths, but is not to be depended upon when the depth is considerable;\r\nbecause the cord being specifically lighter than the water, after it has\r\ndescended to a certain degree, the weight of the lead and that of the\r\ncord is no more than a like volume of water; then the lead descends no\r\nlonger, but moves in an oblique line, and floats at the same depth: to\r\nsound great depths, therefore, an iron chain is requisite, or some\r\nsubstance heavier than water. It is very probable that for want of\r\nconsidering this circumstance, navigators tell us that the sea in many\r\nplaces has no bottom.\r\n\r\nIn general, the profundities in open seas increase or diminish in a\r\npretty uniform manner, and commonly the farther from shore the greater\r\nthe depth; yet this is not without exception, there are places in the\r\nmidst of the sea where shoals are found, as at Abrolhos in the Atlantic;\r\nand others where there are banks of a very considerable extent, as are\r\ndaily experienced by the navigators to the East Indies.\r\n\r\nSo likewise along shore the depths are very unequal, nevertheless we may\r\nlay it down as a certain rule, that the depth there is always\r\nproportionate to the height of that shore. It is the same in great\r\nrivers, where the high shores always announce a great depth.\r\n\r\nIt is more easy to measure the heights of mountains, whether by means of\r\npractical geometry, or by the barometer. This instrument gives the\r\nheight of a mountain very exactly, especially in a country where its\r\nvariation is not considerable, as at Peru, and under the other parts of\r\nthe equator. By one or other of these methods, the height of most\r\neminences has been measured; for example, it has been found that the\r\nhighest mountains of Switzerland are about 1600 fathoms higher than\r\nCanigau, which is one of the most elevated of the Pyrennees; those\r\nmountains appear to be the highest in Europe, since a great quantity of\r\nrivers flow from them, which carry their water into very remote and\r\ndifferent seas, as the Po, which flows into the Adriatic; the Rhine,\r\nwhich loses itself in the sands in Holland; the Rhone, which falls into\r\nthe Mediterranean; and the Danube, which goes to the Black Sea. These\r\nfour rivers, whose mouths are so remote from each other, all derive a\r\npart of their waters from Mount Saint Godard and the neighbouring\r\nmountain, which proves that this place is the highest in all Europe.\r\nThe highest mountains in Asia are Mount Taurus, Mount Imaus, Caucasus,\r\nand the mountains of Japan, all which are loftier than those of Europe;\r\nthe mountains in Africa, as the Great Atlas, and the mountains of the\r\nMoon, are at least as high as those in Asia, and the highest of all are\r\nin South America, particularly those of Peru, which are more than 3000\r\nfathoms above the level of the sea. In general the mountains between the\r\ntropics are loftier than those of the temperate zones, and these more\r\nthan the frigid zones, so that the nearer we approach the equator, the\r\ngreater are the inequalities of the earth. These inequalities, although\r\nvery considerable with respect to us, are scarcely any thing when\r\nconsidered with respect to the whole globe. Three thousand fathom\r\ndifference to 3000 leagues diameter, is but one fathom to a league, or\r\none foot to 2200 feet, which on a globe of 2-1/2 feet diameter, does not\r\nmake the 16th part of a French line. Thus the earth, which appears to us\r\ncrossed and intersected by the enormous height of mountains, and by a\r\nfrightful depth of sea, is nevertheless, relative to its size, but\r\nslightly furrowed with irregularities, so very trifling, that they can\r\ncause no difference to the general figure of the globe. In continents\r\nthe mountains are continued and form chains. In islands, they are more\r\ninterrupted, and generally raised above the sea, in the forms of cones\r\nor pyramids, and are called peaks. The peak of Teneriffe, in the island\r\nof Fer, is one of the highest mountains on the earth; it is near a\r\nleague and a half perpendicular above the level of the sea; the peak of\r\nSt. George, in one of the Azores, and the peak of Adam, in the island of\r\nCeylon, are also very lofty. These peaks are composed of rocks, heaped\r\none upon the other, and they vomit from their summits fire, cinders,\r\nbitumen, minerals, and stones. There are islands which are only tops of\r\nmountains, as of St. Helena, Ascension, most of the Azores, and\r\nCanaries. We must remark, that in most of the islands, promontories, and\r\nother projecting lands in the sea, the middle is always the highest; and\r\nthey are generally separated by chains of mountains, which divide them\r\nin their greatest length, as (Gransbain) the Grampian mountains in\r\nScotland, which extend from east to west, and divide Great Britain into\r\ntwo parts. It is the same with the islands of Sumatra, Lucca, Borneo,\r\nCelebes, Cuba, St. Domingo, and the peninsula of Malaya, &c. and also\r\nItaly, which is traversed through its whole length by the Apennine\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nMountains, as we find, differ greatly in height; the hills are lowest,\r\nafter them come the mountains of a moderate height, which are followed\r\nby a third rank still higher, which, like the preceding, are generally\r\nloaded with trees and plants, but which furnish no springs except at\r\ntheir bottoms. In the highest mountains we find only sand, stones,\r\nflints, and rocks, whose summits often rise above the clouds. Exactly at\r\nthe foot of these rocks there are small spaces, plains, hollows, and\r\nkinds of vallies, where the rain, snow, and ice remain, and form ponds,\r\nmorasses, and springs, from whence rivers derive their origin.\r\n\r\nThe form of mountains is also very different: some form chains whose\r\nheight is nearly equal in a long extent of soil, others are divided by\r\ndeep vallies; some are regular, and others as irregular as possible; and\r\nsometimes in the middle of a valley or plain, we find a little mountain.\r\nThere are also two sorts of plains, the one in the low lands, the other\r\nin mountains. The first are generally divided by some large river: the\r\nothers, though of a very considerable extent, are dry, and at farthest\r\nhave only a small rivulet. These plains on mountains are often very\r\nhigh, and difficult of access; they form countries above other\r\ncountries, as in Auvergne, Savoy, and many other high places: the soil\r\nis firm, and produces much grass, and odoriferous plants, which render\r\nthese plains the best pasture in the world.\r\n\r\nThe summits of high mountains are composed of rocks of different\r\nheights, which resemble from a distance the waves of the sea. It is not\r\non this observation alone we can rely that the mountains have been\r\nformed by the waves, I only relate it because it accords with the rest:\r\nbut that which evidently proves that the sea once covered and formed\r\nmountains, are the shells and other marine productions found throughout\r\nin such great quantities, that it is not possible for them to have been\r\ntransported by the sea into such remote continents, and deposited to\r\nsuch considerable depths; to this may be added, the horizontal and\r\nparallel strata every where met with, and which can only have been\r\nformed by the waters. The composition even of the hardest matters, as\r\nstone and marble, prove they had been reduced into fine powder before\r\ntheir formation, and precipitated to the bottom of the water in form of\r\na sediment: it is also proved by the exactness with which fossil-shells\r\nare moulded in those matters in which they are found; the inside of\r\nthese shells are absolutely filled with the same matters as that in\r\nwhich they are enclosed; the corresponding angles of mountains and\r\nhills, which no other cause than the currents of the sea could have been\r\nable to form; the equality in the height of opposite hills, and beds of\r\ndifferent matters, formed at the same levels, and, in short, the\r\ndirection of mountains, whose chains extend in length in the same\r\ndirection as the waves of the sea extend, incontestibly demonstrate the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the depths on the surface of the earth, the greatest,\r\nwithout contradiction, are the depths of the sea; but as they do not\r\npresent themselves to our sight, and as we can only judge of them by the\r\nplumb line, we shall only speak of those which appear on dry land, such\r\nas the deep vallies between mountains, the precipices between rocks, the\r\nabysses perceived from the tops of mountains, as the abyss of Mount\r\nArarat, the precipices of the Alps, the vallies of the Pyrennees, &c.\r\nThese depths are a natural consequence of the elevation of mountains;\r\nthey receive the waters and the earth which flow from the mountains, and\r\nthe soil is generally very fertile, and are fully inhabited.\r\n\r\nThe precipices which are between rocks are frequently formed by the\r\nsinking of one side, the base of which sometimes gives way more on one\r\nside than the other, by the action of the air and frost, which splits\r\nand divides them, or by the impetuous violence of torrents. But these\r\nabysses, or vast and enormous precipices, found at the summits of\r\nmountains, and to the bottom of which it is not possible sometimes to\r\ndescend, although they are above a mile, or a mile and a half round,\r\nhave been formed by the fire. These were formerly the funnels of\r\nvolcanos, and all the matter which is there deficient has been ejected\r\nby the action and explosion of these fires, which are since extinguished\r\nthrough a defect of combustible matter. The abyss of Mount Ararat, of\r\nwhich M. Tournefort gives a description in his voyage to the Levant, is\r\nsurrounded with black and burnt rocks, as one day the abysses of Etna,\r\nVesuvius, and other volcanos, will be, when they have consumed all the\r\ncombustible matters they include.\r\n\r\nIn Plots' Natural History of Staffordshire, in England, a kind of gulph\r\nis spoken of which has been sounded to the depth of 2600 perpendicular\r\nfeet without meeting with any water, or the bottom being found, as the\r\nrope was not of sufficient length to reach it.\r\n\r\nGreatest cavities and deepest mines are generally in mountains, and they\r\nnever descend to a level with the plains, therefore by these cavities we\r\nare only acquainted with the inside of a mountain, and not with the\r\ninternal part of the globe itself.\r\n\r\nBesides, these depths are not very considerable. Ray asserts that the\r\ndeepest mines are not above half a mile deep. The mine of Cotteberg,\r\nwhich in the time of Agricola passed for the deepest of all known mines,\r\nwas only 2500 feet perpendicular. It is evident there are holes in\r\ncertain places, as that in Staffordshire, or Pool's Hole, in Derbyshire,\r\nthe depth of which is perhaps greater; but all this is nothing in\r\ncomparison with the thickness of the globe.\r\n\r\nIf the kings of Egypt, instead of having erected pyramids, and raised\r\nsuch sumptuous monuments of their riches and vanity, had been at the\r\nsame expence to sound the earth, and make a deep excavation to the depth\r\nof a league, they, perhaps, might have found substances which would have\r\namply recompensed the trouble, labour, and expence, or at least we\r\nshould have received information on the matters of which the internal\r\npart of the globe is composed, which might have been very useful, and\r\nwhich we at present have not.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to the mountains; the highest are in the southern\r\ncountries, and the nearer we approach the equator, the more inequalities\r\nwe find on the surface of the globe. This is easy to prove, by a short\r\nenumeration of the mountains and islands.\r\n\r\nIn America, the chain of the Cordeliers, the highest mountains of the\r\nearth, is exactly under the equator, and extends on the two sides far\r\nbeyond the tropic circles.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, the highest mountains of the Moon, and Monomotapa, the great\r\nand the little Atlas, are under the equator, or not far from it.\r\n\r\nIn Asia, Mount Caucasus, the chain of which extends under different\r\nnames as far as the mountains of China, is nearer the equator than the\r\npoles.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the Pyrennees, the Alps, and mountains of Greece, which are\r\nonly the same chain, are still less distant from the equator than the\r\npoles.\r\n\r\nNow these mountains which we have enumerated, are all higher, more\r\nconsiderable and extended in length and breadth than the mountains of\r\nthe northern countries.\r\n\r\nWith respect to their direction, the Alps form a chain which crosses the\r\nwhole continent from Spain to China. These mountains begin at the sea\r\ncoast of Galicia, reach to the Pyrennees, cross France, by Vivares, and\r\nAuvergne, pass through Italy and extend into Germany, beyond Dalmatia,\r\nas far as Macedonia; from thence they join with the mountains of\r\nArmenia, Caucasus, Taurus, Imaus, and extend as far as the Tartarian\r\nsea. So likewise Mount Atlas traverses the whole continent of Africa,\r\nfrom west to east, from the kingdom of Fez to the Straits of the Red\r\nSea; and the mountains of the Moon have the same direction.\r\n\r\nBut in America, the direction is quite contrary, and the chains of the\r\nCordeliers and other mountains extend from south to north more than from\r\neast to west.\r\n\r\nWhat we have now said on the great eminences of the earth, may also be\r\nobserved on the greatest depths of the sea. The vast and highest seas\r\nare nearer the equator than the poles; and there results from this\r\nobservation, that the greatest inequalities of the globe are in the\r\nsouthern climate. These irregularities on the surface of the earth, are\r\nthe causes of an infinity of extraordinary effects: for example, between\r\nthe Indus and the Ganges, there is a large peninsula, which is divided\r\nthrough its middle, by a chain of high mountains called the Gate, and\r\nwhich extends from north to south, from the extremities of Mount\r\nCaucasus to Cape Comorin; on one is the coast of Malabar, and the other\r\nCoromandel; on the side of Malabar, between this chain of mountains and\r\nthe sea, the summer season lasts from September to April, during which\r\nthe sky is serene and dry; on the other side the Coromandel the above\r\nperiod is their winter, and it rains every day plentifully and from the\r\nmonth of April to the month of September is their summer, whereas it is\r\nwinter in Malabar; insomuch, that in many places, which are scarcely 20\r\nmiles distant, we may, by crossing the mountains, change seasons. It is\r\nsaid that the same thing takes place at Razalgat in Arabia, and at\r\nJamaica, which is divided through its middle by a chain of mountains,\r\nwhose direction is from east to west, and that the plantations to the\r\nsouth of these mountains feel the summer heat, at the time those to the\r\nnorth endure the rigor of winter.\r\n\r\nPeru, which is situated under the line, and extends about a thousand\r\nleagues to the south, is divided into three long and narrow parts; these\r\nthe natives call Lanos, Sierras, and Andes. The Lanos, which comprehends\r\nthe plains, extends along the coast of the South Sea: the Sierras are\r\nhills with some vallies, and the Andes are the famous Cordeliers, the\r\nhighest mountains that are known. The Lanos is about ten leagues in\r\nbreadth; in many places the Sierras are twenty leagues broad, and the\r\nAndes in some places more and in some less. The breadth is from east to\r\nwest, and the length from north to south. This part of the world is\r\nremarkable for the following particulars: first, in the Lanos the wind\r\nalmost constantly blows from the south-west, which is contrary to what\r\nhappens in the torrid zone: secondly, it never rains nor thunders in the\r\nLanos, although there is plenty of dew: thirdly, it almost continually\r\nrains in the Andes: fourthly, in the Sierras, between the Lanos and the\r\nAndes, it rains from September to April.\r\n\r\nIt was for a long time supposed, that the chains of the high mountains\r\nrun from west to east, till the contrary was found in America. But no\r\nperson before M. Bourguet discovered the surprising regularity of the\r\nstructure of those great masses: he found (after having crossed the Alps\r\nthirty times in fourteen different parts of it, twice over the Apennine\r\nmountains, and made divers tours in the environs of these mountains, and\r\nof Mount Jura) that all mountains are formed nearly after the manner of\r\nworks of a fortification. When the body of the mountain runs from east\r\nto west, it forms prominences, which face the north and south; this\r\nwonderful regularity is so striking in vallies, that we seem to walk in\r\na very regular covered way; if, for example, we travel in a valley from\r\nnorth to south, we perceive that the mountain on the right forms\r\nprojections which front the east, and those of the mountain on the left\r\nfront the west, so that the saliant angles of one side reciprocally\r\nanswer the returning angles of the other, which are always alternatively\r\nopposed to them. The angles which mountains form in great vallies are\r\nless acute, because the direction is less steep, and they are farther\r\ndistant from each other. In plains they are not so perceptible, except\r\nby the banks of rivers, which are generally in the middle of them, and\r\nwhose natural windings answer the most advanced angles or striking\r\nprojections of the mountains. It is astonishing so visible a thing was\r\nso long unobserved, for when in a valley the inclination of one of the\r\nmountains which border it is less steep than that of the other, the\r\nriver takes its course much nearer the steepest mountain, and does not\r\nflow through its middle.\r\n\r\nTo these observations we may join other particular ones, which confirm\r\nthem; for example, the mountains of Switzerland are much more steep, and\r\ntheir direction much greater on the south side than on the north, and on\r\nthe west side than on the east. This may be perceived in the mountains\r\nof Gemmi, Brisa, and almost every other mountain in this country. The\r\nhighest are those which separate Valesia and the Grisons from Savoy,\r\nPiedmont, and Tirol. These countries are only a continuation of these\r\nmountains, the chain of which extends to the Mediterranean, and\r\ncontinues even pretty far under the sea. The Pyrennees are also only a\r\ncontinuation of that vast mountain which begins in Upper Valesia, and\r\nwhose branches extend very far to the west and south, preserving\r\nthroughout the same great height; whereas on the side of the north and\r\nof the east these mountains grow lower by degrees, till they become\r\nplains; as we see by the large tract which the Rhine and Danube water\r\nbefore they reach their mouths, whereas the Rhone descends with rapidity\r\ntowards the south into the Mediterranean. The same observation is found\r\nto hold good in the mountains of England and Norway; but the part of the\r\nworld where this is most evidently seen is at Peru and Chili; the\r\nCordeliers are cut very sharply on the western side, the length of the\r\nPacific Ocean, whereas on the eastern side they lower by degrees into\r\nlarge plains, watered by the greatest rivers of the world.[279:A]\r\n\r\nM. Bourguet, to whom we owe this great discovery of the correspondence\r\nof the angles of mountains, terms it \"_The Key of the Theory of the\r\nEarth_;\" nevertheless, it appears to me, that if he had conceived all\r\nthe importance of it, he would more successfully have made use of it,\r\nby connecting it with suitable facts, and would have given a more\r\nprobable theory of the earth; whereas in his treatise he presents only\r\nthe skeleton of an hypothetical system, most of the conclusions of which\r\nare false or precarious. The theory we have given turns on four\r\nprincipal facts, which cannot be doubted, after the proofs have been\r\nexamined on which they are founded. The first is, that the earth is\r\nevery where, and to considerable depths, composed of parallel strata,\r\nand matters which have formerly been in a state of softness: the second,\r\nthat the sea has for ages covered the earth which we now inhabit; the\r\nthird, that the tides and other motions of the waters produce\r\ninequalities at the bottom of the sea; and the fourth, that the\r\nmountains have taken their form and the correspondent direction from the\r\ncurrents of the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter having read the proofs which the following articles contain, it\r\nmay be determined, whether I was wrong to assert, that these\r\ncircumstances solidly established also ascertains the truth of the\r\ntheory of the earth. What I have said on the formation of mountains has\r\nno need of a more ample explanation; but as it might be objected that I\r\ndo not assign a reason for the formation of the peaks or points of\r\nmountains, no more than for some other particular circumstances, shall\r\nadd the observations and reflections which I have made on this subject.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to form a clear and general idea of the manner in\r\nwhich the different matters that compose the earth are arranged, and it\r\nappears to me they may be reduced into two general classes; the first\r\nincludes all the matters we find placed in strata, or beds horizontally\r\nor regularly inclined; and the second comprehends all matters formed in\r\nmasses, or in veins, either perpendicular or irregularly inclined. In\r\nthe first class are included sands, clays, granite, flints, free-stone,\r\ncoals, slates, marls, chalks, calcinable stones, marbles, &c. In the\r\nsecond I rank metals, minerals, crystals, precious stones and small\r\nflints: these two classes generally comprehend all the known materials\r\nof the earth. The first owe their origin to the sediments carried away\r\nand deposited by the sea, and should be distinguished into those which\r\nbeing assayed in the fire, calcine and are reduced into lime, and those\r\nwhich fuse and are convertible into glass. The materials of the second\r\nclass are all vitrifiable excepting those which the fire entirely\r\nconsumes by inflammation.\r\n\r\nIn the first class we distinguish two kinds of sands; the one, which is\r\nmore abundant than any other matter of the globe, is vitrifiable, or\r\nrather is only fragments of actual glass; the other, whose quantity is\r\nmuch less, is calcinable, and must be looked upon as the powder of\r\nstone, and which differs only from gravel by the size of the grains. The\r\nvitrifiable sand is, in general, deposited in beds, which are often\r\ninterrupted by masses of free-stone, granite, and flint; and sometimes\r\nthese matters are also in banks of great extent.\r\n\r\nBy examining these vitrifiable matters, we find only a few sea shells\r\nthere, and those not placed in beds, but dispersed about as if thrown\r\nthere by chance. For example, I have never seen them in free-stone; that\r\nstone which is very plenty in certain places, is only composed of sandy\r\nparts, which are re-united, and are only met with in sandy soils; and\r\nthe quarries of it are generally in peaked hills and in divided\r\neminences. We may work these quarries in all directions, and if they are\r\nin large beds, they are much farther from each other than in quarries of\r\ncalcinable stone or marble. Blocks of free-stone may be cut of all\r\ndimensions and in all directions, although it is difficult to work, it\r\nnevertheless has but a degree of hardness sufficient to resist powerful\r\nstrokes without splitting; for friction easily reduces it into sand,\r\nexcepting certain black pieces found therein, and which are so very\r\nhard, that the best files cannot touch them. Rock is vitrifiable as\r\nfree-stone, and of the same nature, only it is harder and the parts more\r\nconnected. This also contains many hard pieces, as may easily be\r\nremarked on the summits of high mountains, which cut and tear the shoes\r\nof travellers. This rocky stone, which is found at the top of high\r\nmountains, and which I look upon as a kind of granite, contains a great\r\nquantity of talky leaves, and is so hard as not to be worked but by an\r\ninfinite deal of labour.\r\n\r\nI have narrowly examined these sharp pieces which are found in\r\nfree-stone and rock, and have discovered it to be a metallic matter,\r\nmelted and calcined by a very violent fire, and which perfectly\r\nresembles certain substances thrown out by the volcanos, of which I saw\r\na great quantity when I was in Italy, where the people called them\r\nSchiarri. They are very heavy black masses, on which neither water nor\r\nthe file can make any impression, and the matter of which is different\r\nfrom that of the lava; for this is a kind of glass, whereas the other\r\nappears to be more metallic than vitreous. The sharp pieces in\r\nfree-stone, and rock, resemble greatly the first matter, which seems\r\nstill to prove that all these matters have been formerly liquified by\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes see on the upper parts of mountains, a prodigious quantity\r\nof blocks of this mixed rock; their position is so irregular that they\r\nappear to have been thrown there by chance, and it might be thought they\r\nhad fallen from some neighbouring height, if the places where they are\r\nfound were not raised above the other parts. But their vitrifiable\r\nnature, and their angular and square figures, like those of free-stone,\r\ndiscover them to be of one common origin. Thus in the great beds of\r\nvitrifiable sand, blocks of free-stone and rock are formed, whose\r\nfigures and situations do not exactly follow the horizontal position of\r\nthese strata. The rain, by degrees, carried away from the summits of the\r\nhills and mountains the sand which at first covered them, and then began\r\nto furrow and cut those hills into the spaces which are found between\r\nthe nucleus in free-stone, as the hills of Fontainbleau are intersected.\r\nEach hilly point answers to a nucleus in a quarry of free-stone, and\r\neach interval has been excavated and loosened by the rain, which has\r\ncaused the sand, they at first contained, to flow into the vallies; so\r\nlikewise the highest mountains, whose summits are composed of rocks, and\r\nterminated by these angular blocks of granite, have formerly been\r\ncovered with vitrifiable sand, and the rain having carried away the sand\r\nwhich covered them, they remained on the tops of the mountains in the\r\nposition they were formed. These blocks generally present points; they\r\nincrease in size in proportion as they descend; one block often rests\r\nupon another, the second upon a third, and so on, leaving irregular\r\nintervals between them: and as in time the rain washed away all the sand\r\nwhich covered these different parts on the top of the high mountains,\r\nthey would remain naked, forming larger or lesser points; and this is\r\nthe origin of the peaks or horns of mountains.\r\n\r\nFor supposing, as it is easy to prove by the marine productions we find\r\nthere, that the chain of the Alps was formerly covered by the sea, and\r\nthat above this chain there was a great thickness of vitrifiable sand,\r\nwhich rendered the whole mountains a flat and level country. In this\r\ndepth of sand, there would necessarily be formed granite, free-stone,\r\nflint, and all matters which take their origin and figure in sand,\r\nnearly in a similar manner to that of the crystallisation of salts.\r\nThese blocks once formed would support their original positions, after\r\nthe rains and torrents had carried away the sand which surrounded them,\r\nand being left bare formed all those peaks or pointed eminences we see\r\nin so many places. This is also the origin of those high and detached\r\nrocks found in China and other countries, as in Ireland, where they are\r\ncalled the Devil's stones, and whose formation as well as that of the\r\npeaks of mountains, had hitherto appeared so difficult to explain;\r\nnevertheless the explanation which I have given is so natural, that it\r\ndirectly presents itself to the mind of those who examine these objects,\r\nand I must here quote what Father Tatre says, \"From Yanchu-in-yen, we\r\ncame to Hoytcheou, and on the road met with something particular, rocks\r\nof an extraordinary height, of the shape of a large square tower, and\r\nsituate in the midst of vast plains: I cannot account for it, unless by\r\nsupposing they were formerly mountains, from which the rain having\r\nwashed away the earth that surrounded them, thus left the rocks entirely\r\nbare. What strengthens this conjecture is, that we saw some which,\r\ntowards the base, are still covered with earth to a considerable\r\nheight.\"\r\n\r\nThe summits of the highest mountains are composed of rocks, of granite,\r\nfree-stone, and other hard and vitrifiable matters, and this often as\r\ndeep as two or three hundred fathoms; below which we often meet with\r\nquarries of marble, or hard stone, filled with fossil-shells, and whose\r\nmatter is calcinable; as may be remarked at Great Chartreuse, in\r\nDauphiny, and on Mount Cenis, where the stone and marble, which contains\r\nshells, are some hundred fathoms below the summits, points and peaks of\r\nhigh mountains; although these stones are more than a thousand fathom\r\nabove the level of the sea. Thus mountains, whereon we see points or\r\npeaks, are generally vitrifiable rock, and those whose summits are flat,\r\nmostly contain marble and hard stones filled with marine productions. It\r\nis the same with respect to hills, for those containing granite, or\r\nfree-stone, are mostly intersected with points, eminences, cavities,\r\ndepths, and small intermediate valleys; on the contrary, those which\r\nare composed of calcinable stone are nearly equal in height, and are\r\nonly interrupted by greater and more regular vallies, whose angles are\r\ncorrespondent; and they are crowned with rocks whose position is regular\r\nand level.\r\n\r\nWhatever difference may appear at first between these two species of\r\nmountains, their forms proceed from the same cause, as we have already\r\nobserved; only it may be remarked, that the calcinable stones have not\r\nundergone any alteration nor change since the formation of the\r\nhorizontal strata; whereas those of vitrifiable sand have been changed\r\nand interrupted by the posterior production of rocks and angular blocks\r\nformed within this sand. These two kinds of mountains have cracks which\r\nare almost always perpendicular in those of calcinable stones; but those\r\nof granite and free-stone appear to be a little more irregular in their\r\ndirection. It is in these cracks metal, minerals, crystals, sulphurs,\r\nand all matters of the second class are found, and it is below these\r\ncracks that the water collects to penetrate the earth, and form those\r\nveins of water which are every where found below the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[279:A] See Phil. Trans. Abr. Vol. VI. part ii. p. 153.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE X.\r\n\r\nOF RIVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have before said that, generally speaking, the greatest mountains are\r\nin islands and in the projections in the sea. That in the old continent\r\nthe greatest chains of mountains are directed from west to east, and\r\nthat those which incline towards the north or south are only branches of\r\nthese principal chains; we shall likewise find that the greatest rivers\r\nare directed as the greatest mountains, and that there are but few which\r\nfollow the course of the branches of those mountains. To be assured of\r\nthis, we have only to look on a common globe, and trace the old\r\ncontinent from Spain to China. We shall find, by beginning at Spain,\r\nthat the Vigo, Douro, Tagos, and Guadiana run from east to west, and the\r\nEbro from west to east, and that there is not one remarkable river whose\r\ncourse is directed from south to north, or from north to south, although\r\nSpain is entirely surrounded by the sea on the west side, and almost so\r\non the north. This observation on the directions of rivers in Spain not\r\nonly proves that the mountains in this country are directed from west to\r\neast, but also that the southern lands, which border on the straits, are\r\nhigher than the coasts of Portugal; and on the northern coast, that the\r\nmountains of Galicia, the Asturias, &c. are only a continuation of the\r\nPyrennees, and that it is this elevation of the country, as well north\r\nas south, which does not permit the rivers to run into the sea that way.\r\n\r\nIt will also be seen, by looking on the map of France, that there is\r\nonly the Rhone which runs from north to south, and nearly half its\r\ncourse, from the mountains to Lyons, is directed from the east towards\r\nthe west; but that on the contrary all the other great rivers, as the\r\nLoir, the Charantee, the Garonne, and even the Seine, have a direction\r\nfrom east to west.\r\n\r\nIt will be likewise perceived, that in Germany there is only the Rhine,\r\nwhich like the Rhone shapes the greatest part of its course from north\r\nto south, but that the others, as the Danube, the Drave, and all the\r\ngreat rivers which fall into them, flow from the west to east into the\r\nBlack Sea.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that this Black Sea, which should rather be\r\nconsidered as a great lake, has almost three times more extent from east\r\nto west than from north to south, and consequently its direction is\r\nsimilar to the rivers in general. It is the same with the Mediterranean,\r\nwhose length from east to west is about six times greater than from\r\nnorth to south.\r\n\r\nThe Caspian Sea, according to the chart drawn by the order of Czar Peter\r\nI. has more extent from the south to the north than from east to west;\r\nwhereas in the ancient charts it appears almost round, or rather more\r\nbroad from east to west than from south to north; but if we consider the\r\nlake Aral as a part of the Caspian Sea, from which it is separated only\r\nby plains of sand, we shall find the length is from the western coast of\r\nthe Caspian Sea as far as the greatest border of Lake Aral.\r\n\r\nSo likewise the Euphrates, the Persian gulph, and almost all the rivers\r\nin China run from west to east; all the rivers in Africa beyond Barbary\r\nflow from east to west, or from west to east, and there are only the\r\nrivers of Barbary and the Nile which flow from south to north. There\r\nare, in fact, great rivers in Asia which partly run from north to\r\nsouth, as the Wolga, the Don, &c. but by taking the whole length of\r\ntheir course, we find, that they only turn from the south to run into\r\nthe Black and Caspian seas, which are only inland lakes.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore in general be said, that in Europe, Asia, and Africa,\r\nthe rivers, and other mediterranean waters, extend more from east to\r\nwest than from north to south, which proceeds from the chains of\r\nmountains being for the most part so directed, and that the whole\r\ncontinent of Europe and Asia is broader in this direction than the\r\nother; for there are two modes of considering the direction of\r\nmountains. In a long and narrow continent like South America, in which\r\nthere is only one principal chain of mountains which stretches from\r\nsouth to north, the river not being confined by any parallel range,\r\nnecessarily runs perpendicular to the course of the mountains, that is\r\nfrom east to west, or from west to east; in fact, it is in this\r\ndirection all the rivers of America flow. In the old as well as the new\r\ncontinent most of the waters have their greatest extent from west to\r\neast, and most of the rivers flow in this direction; but yet this\r\nsimilar direction is produced by different causes; for instance, those\r\nin the old continent flow from east to west, because they are bounded\r\nby mountains whose direction is from west to east; whereas those in\r\nAmerica preserve the same course from there being only one chain of\r\nmountains that extends from north to south.\r\n\r\nIn general, rivers run through the centre of vallies, or rather the\r\nlowest ground betwixt two opposite hills or mountains; if the two hills\r\nhave nearly an equal inclination, the river will be nearly in the middle\r\nof the intermediate valley, let the valley be broad or narrow. On the\r\ncontrary, if one of the hills has a more steep inclination than the\r\nother, the river will not be in the middle of the valley, but much\r\nnearer the hill whose inclination is greatest, and that too in\r\nproportion to the superiority of its declivity: in this case, the lowest\r\nground is not in the middle of the valley, but inclines towards the\r\nhighest hill, and which the river must necessarily occupy. In all places\r\nwhere there is any considerable difference in the height of the\r\nmountains, the rivers flow at the foot of the steepest hills, and follow\r\nthem throughout all their directions, never quitting their course while\r\nthey maintain the superiority of height. In the length of time, however,\r\nthe steepest hills are diminished by the rain acting upon them with a\r\ngreater degree of force, proportionate to their height, and consequently\r\ncarry away the sand and gravel in more considerable quantities, and with\r\ngreater violence; the river is then constrained to change its bed, and\r\nseek the lowest part of the valley: to this may be added, that as all\r\nrivers overflow at times, they transport and deposit mud and sand in\r\ndifferent places, and that sands often accumulate in their own beds, and\r\ncause a swell of the water, which changes the direction of its course.\r\nIt is very common to meet in vallies with a great number of old channels\r\nof the river, particularly if it is subject to frequent inundations, and\r\ncarries off much sand and mud.\r\n\r\nIn plains and large vallies, where there are great rivers, the beds are\r\ngenerally the lowest part of the valley, but the surface of the water is\r\nvery often higher than the ground adjacent. For example, when a river\r\nbegins to overflow, the plain will presently be inundated to a\r\nconsiderable breadth, and it will be observed that the borders of the\r\nriver will be covered the last; which proves that they are higher than\r\nthe rest of the ground, and that from the banks to a certain part of\r\nthe plain, there is an insensible inclination, so that the surface of\r\nthe water must be higher than the plain when the river is full. This\r\nelevation on the banks of rivers proceeds from the deposit of the mud\r\nand sand at the time of inundations. The water is commonly very muddy in\r\nthe great swellings of rivers; when it begins to overflow, it runs very\r\ngently over the banks, and by depositing the mud and sand purifies\r\nitself as it advances into the plain; so that all the soil which the\r\ncurrents of the river does not carry along, is deposited on the banks,\r\nwhich raises them by degrees above the rest of the plain.\r\n\r\nRivers are always broadest at their mouths; in proportion as we advance\r\nin the country, and are more remote from the sea, their breadth\r\ndiminishes; but what is more remarkable, in the inland parts they flow\r\nin a direct line, and in proportion as they approach their mouths the\r\nwindings of their course increase. I have been informed by M. Fabry, a\r\nsensible traveller, who went several times by land into the western part\r\nof North America, that travellers, and even the savages, are seldom\r\ndeceived in the distance they are from the sea if they follow the bank\r\nof a large river; when the direction of the river is straight for 15 or\r\n20 leagues, they know themselves to be a great distance from the coast;\r\nbut, on the contrary, if the river winds, and often changes its\r\ndirection, they are certain of not being far from the sea. M. Fabry\r\nhimself verified this remark in his travels over that unknown and almost\r\nuninhabited country. In large rivers there is a considerable eddy along\r\nthe banks, which is so much the more considerable as the river is less\r\nremote from the sea, which may also serve as a guide to judge whether we\r\nare at a great or short distance from the mouth; and as the windings of\r\nrivers increase in proportion as they approach the sea, it is not\r\nsurprising that some of them should give way to the water, and be one\r\nreason why great rivers generally divide into many arms before they gain\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the waters in rivers is quite different from that supposed\r\nby authors who attempt to give mathematical theories on this subject;\r\nthe surface of a river in motion is not level when taken from one bank\r\nto the other, but according to circumstances the current in the middle\r\nis considerably higher or lower than the water close to the banks; when\r\na river swells by a sudden melting of snow, or when by some other cause\r\nits rapidity is augmented, if the direction of the river is straight,\r\nthe middle of the water where the current is rises, and the river forms\r\na convex curve, of a very sensible elevation. This elevation is\r\nsometimes very considerable; M. Hupeau, an able engineer of bridges,\r\nonce measured the river Avieron, and found the middle was three feet\r\nhigher than near the bank. This, in fact, must happen every time the\r\nwater has a very great rapidity; the velocity with which it is carried,\r\ndiminishing the action of its weight in the middle of the current, so\r\nthat it has not time to sink to a level with that near shore, and\r\ntherefore remains higher. On the other hand, near the mouths, it often\r\nhappens that the water which is near the banks is higher than that of\r\nthe middle, although the current be ever so rapid. This happens wherever\r\nthe action of the tides is felt in a river, which in great ones often\r\nsensibly extends as far as one or two hundred leagues from the sea; it\r\nis also a well known fact that the current of a river preserves its\r\nmotion in the sea to a considerable distance; there is, in this case,\r\ntherefore, two contrary motions in a river; the middle, which forms the\r\ncurrent, precipitates itself towards the sea, and the action of the\r\ntide forms a counter-current, which causes the water near the banks to\r\nascend, while that in the middle descends, and as then all the water\r\nmust be carried down by the current in the middle, that of the banks\r\ncontinually descends thereto, and descends so much the more as it is\r\nhigher, and counteracted with more force by the tide.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of ebbings in rivers; the first above-mentioned is a\r\nstrong power occasioned by the tide, which not only opposes the natural\r\nmotion of the river, but even forces a contrary and opposite current.\r\nThe other arises from an inactive cause, such as a projection of land,\r\nan island, &c. This does not commonly occasion a very sensible\r\ncounter-current, yet it is sufficient to impede the progress of boats\r\nand craft, and necessarily produces what is called a dead water, which\r\ndoes not flow like the rest of the river, but whirls about in such a\r\nmanner that when boats are drawn therein they require great strength to\r\nget them out. These dead waters are very perceptible at the arches of\r\nbridges in rapid rivers. The velocity of the water increases in\r\nproportion as the diameter of the channel through which it passes\r\ndiminishes, the impelling force being the same; the velocity of a\r\nriver, therefore, increases at the passage of a bridge, in an inverse\r\nproportion of the breadth of the arches to the whole breadth of the\r\nriver; the rapidity being very considerable in coming through the arch,\r\nit forces the water against the banks, from whence it is reflected with\r\nsuch violence as to form dangerous eddies and whirlpools. In going\r\nthrough the bridge St. Esprit, the men are forced to be careful not to\r\nlose the stream, even after they are past the bridge, for if they suffer\r\nthe boat to go either to the right or left, it might be driven against\r\nthe shore, or forced into the whirling waters, which would be attended\r\nwith great danger. When this eddy is very considerable, it forms a kind\r\nof small gulph, the middle of which appears hollow and to form a kind of\r\ncylindrical cavity, around which the water whirls with rapidity: this\r\nappearance of a cylindrical cavity is produced by the centrifugal force,\r\nwhich causes the water to endeavour to remove itself from the centre of\r\nthe whirlpool. When a great swell of water happens, the watermen know it\r\nby a particular motion; they then say the water at the bottom flows\r\nquicker than common: this augmentation of rapidity at the bottom,\r\naccording to them, always announces a sudden rise of the water. The\r\nmotion and weight of the upper water communicates this motion to them;\r\nfor in certain respects we must consider a river as a pillar of water\r\ncontained in a tube, and the whole channel as a very long canal where\r\nevery motion must be communicated from one end to the other. Now,\r\nindependent of the motion of the upper waters, their weight alone might\r\ncause the rapidity of the river to increase, and perhaps move it at\r\nbottom; for it is known, that by putting many boats at one time into the\r\nwater, at that instant we increase the rapidity of the under part of the\r\nriver, as well as retard that of the upper.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of running waters does not exactly, nor even nearly, follow\r\nthe proportion of the declivity of their channels. One river whose\r\ninclination is uniform and double that of another, ought, according to\r\nappearance, to flow only as rapid again, but in fact it flows much\r\nfaster. Its rapidity, instead of being doubled, is sometimes triple,\r\nquadruple, &c. This rapidity depends much more on the quantity of water\r\nand the weight of the upper waters than on the declivity. When we are\r\ndesirous to hollow the bed of a river, we need not equally distribute\r\nthe inclination throughout its whole length, in order to give a greater\r\nrapidity, as it is more easily effected by making the descent much\r\ngreater at the beginning, than at the mouth, where it may almost be\r\ninsensible, as we see it in natural rivers, and yet they preserve a\r\nrapidity so much the greater as the river is fuller of water; in great\r\nrivers, where the ground is level, the water does not cease flowing, and\r\neven rapidly, not only with its original velocity, but also with the\r\naddition of that which it has acquired by the action and weight of the\r\nupper waters. To render this fact more conceivable, let us suppose the\r\nSeine between the Pont-neuf and Pont-royal to be perfectly level, and\r\nten feet deep throughout: let us then suppose that the bed of the river\r\nbelow Pont-royal and above Pont-neuf were left entirely dry, the water\r\nwould instantly run up and down the channel, and continue to do so until\r\nit had recovered an equilibrium; for the weight of the water would keep\r\nit in motion, nor would it cease flowing until its particles became\r\nequally pressed and have sunk to a perfect level. The weight of water\r\ntherefore greatly contributes to its velocity, and this is the reason\r\nthat the greatest rapidity of the current is neither of the surface nor\r\nat the bottom of the water, but nearly in the middle of its depth, being\r\npressed by the action of its weight at its surface, and by the re-action\r\nfrom the bottom. Still more, if a river has acquired a great rapidity,\r\nit will not only preserve it in passing a level country, but even\r\nsurmount an eminence without spreading much on either side, or at least\r\nwithout causing any great inundation.\r\n\r\nWe might be inclined to think that bridges, locks, and other obstacles\r\nraised on rivers, considerably diminishes the celerity of the water's\r\ncourse; nevertheless that occasions but little difference. Water rises\r\non meeting with any obstacle, and having surmounted it, the elevation\r\ncauses it to act with more rapidity in its fall, so that in fact it\r\nsuffers little or no diminution in its celerity, by these seeming\r\nretardments. Sinuosities, projections, and islands, also but very little\r\ndiminish the velocity of the course of rivers. A considerable diminution\r\nis produced by the sinking of the water, and, on the contrary, its\r\naugmentation increases its velocity; thus if a river is shallow the\r\nstream passes slowly along, and if deep with a proportionate rapidity.\r\n\r\nIf rivers were always nearly of an equal fulness, the best means of\r\ndiminishing their rapidity, and confining them within their banks, would\r\nbe to enlarge their channel; but as almost all rivers are subject to\r\nincrease and diminish, to confine them we must retrench the channel,\r\nbecause in shallow waters, if the channel is very broad, the water which\r\npasses in the middle hollows a winding bed, and when it begins to swell\r\nfollows the direction it took in this particular bed, and striking\r\nforcibly against the banks of the channel destroys them and does great\r\ninjuries. These effects of the water's fury might be prevented by\r\nmaking, at particular distances, small gulphs in the earth; that is, by\r\ncutting through one of these banks to a certain distance in the land. In\r\norder that these gulphs might be advantageously placed, they should be\r\nmade in the obtuse angle of the river, for then the current of the water\r\nin turning would run into them, and of course its velocity would be\r\ndiminished. This mode might be proper to prevent the fall of bridges in\r\nplaces where it is not possible to make bars near the bridge which\r\nsustain the action of the weight of the water.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which inundations are occasioned merits peculiar\r\nattention. When a river swells, the rapidity of the water always\r\nincreases till it begins to overflow the banks; at that instant the\r\nvelocity diminishes, which causes inundations to continue for several\r\ndays; for when even a less quantity of water comes after the overflowing\r\nthan before, the inundation will still be made, because it depends much\r\nmore on the velocity of the water than on the quantity; if it was not so\r\nrivers would overflow for an hour or two and then return to their beds,\r\nwhich never occurs; the inundations always remaining for several days;\r\nwhether the rain ceases, or a less quantity of water is brought, because\r\nthe overflowing has diminished the velocity, and consequently, although\r\nthe like quantity of water is no longer carried in the same time as\r\nbefore, yet the effects are the same as if the greater quantity had come\r\nthere. It might be remarked on the occasion of this diminution, that if\r\na constant wind blows against the current of the river, the inundation\r\nwill be much greater than it would have been without this accidental\r\ncause, which diminishes the celerity of the water; on the contrary, if\r\nthe wind blows in the same directions with the current, the inundation\r\nwill be much less, and will more speedily decline.\r\n\r\n\"The swelling of the Nile, says M. Granger, and its inundations, has a\r\nlong time employed the learned; most of them have looked upon it as\r\nmarvellous, although nothing can be more natural, and is every day to be\r\nseen in every country throughout the world. It is the rains which fall\r\nin Abyssinia and Ethiopia which cause the swelling and inundation of\r\nthat river, though the north wind must be regarded as the principal\r\ncause. 1. Because the north wind drives the clouds which contain this\r\nrain into Abyssinia. 2. Because, blowing against the mouths of the Nile,\r\nit causes the waters to return against the stream, and thus prevents\r\nthem from running out in any great quantity: this circumstance may be\r\nevery season observed, for when the wind, being at the north, suddenly\r\nveers to the south, the Nile loses in one day more than it gathers in\r\nfour.\"\r\n\r\nInundations are generally greatest in the upper part of rivers, because\r\nthe velocity of a river continues always increasing until it arrives at\r\nthe sea, for the reasons we have related. Father Costelli, who has\r\nwritten very sensibly on this subject, remarks, that the height of the\r\nbanks made to confine the Po from overflowing diminishes as they advance\r\ntowards the sea; so that at Ferrara, which is 50 or 60 miles from the\r\nsea, they are near 20 feet high above the common surface of the Po, but\r\nthat at 10 or 12 miles from it they are not above 12 feet, although the\r\nchannel of the river is as narrow there as at Ferrara[306:A].\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the theory of the motion of running waters is still\r\nsubject to many difficulties, nor is it easy to lay down rules which\r\nmight be applied to every particular case. Experience is here more\r\nuseful than speculation. We must not only know the general effects of\r\nrivers, but we must also know in particular the river we have to do\r\nwith, if we would reason justly, make useful observations, and draw\r\nstable conclusions. The remarks I have above given are mostly new; it is\r\nto be wished that others may be collected, and then, possibly, in time,\r\nwe may obtain a sufficient knowledge of the subject to lay down certain\r\nrules to confine and direct rivers, and prevent the ruin of bridges,\r\nbanks, and other damages which the violent impetuosity of the water\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nThe greatest rivers in Europe are the Wolga, which is about 650 leagues\r\nin its course from Reschow to Astracan, on the Caspian Sea; the Danube,\r\nwhose course is about 450 leagues from the mountains of Switzerland to\r\nthe Black Sea; the Don, which is 400 leagues in its course from the\r\nsource of the Sosnia, which it receives, to its mouth in the Black Sea;\r\nthe Dnieper, whose course is about 350 leagues, and which also runs into\r\nthe Black Sea; the Duine is about 400 leagues in its course, and empties\r\nitself into the White Sea, &c.\r\n\r\nThe greatest rivers in Asia are the Hoanho of China, whose course is 850\r\nleagues, taking its source at Raja-Ribron, and falls into the sea of\r\nChina, in the middle of the gulph Changi: the Jenisca of Tartary, which\r\nis about 800 leagues in extent, from the lake Seligna to the northern\r\nsea of Tartary; the river Oby, which is about 600 leagues from Lake\r\nKila, to the Northern Sea, beyond the Strait of Waigats. The river\r\nAmour, of eastern Tartary, which is about 575 leagues in its course,\r\nreckoning it from the source of the river Kerlon, to the sea of\r\nKamschatka. The river Menan, whose mouth is at Poulo Condor, may be\r\nmeasured from the surface of the Longmu which falls into it; the Kian,\r\nwhose course is about 550 leagues from the source of the river Kinxa,\r\nwhich it receives, to its mouth in the China Sea; the Ganges is also\r\nabout 550 leagues, and the Euphrates 500, taking it from the source of\r\nIrma, which it receives. The Indus about 400 leagues, and which falls\r\ninto the Arabian Sea, on the east of Guzarat. The Sirderious, which is\r\nabout 400 leagues long, and falls into Lake Aral.\r\n\r\nThe greatest rivers in Africa are Senegal, which is 1125 leagues long,\r\ncomprehending the Niger, which in fact is a continuation of it, and the\r\nsource of Gombarou, which falls into the Niger. The Nile 970 leagues\r\nlong, and which derives its source in Upper Ethiopia, where it makes\r\nmany windings. There are also the Zaira, the Coanza, and the Couma,\r\nwhich are known as far as 400 leagues, but extend much farther; the\r\nQuilmanci, whose course is 400 leagues, and which derives its source in\r\nthe kingdom of Gingiro.\r\n\r\nThe greatest rivers of America, and which are also the greatest in the\r\nworld, are the river Amazons, whose course is 1200 leagues, if we go up\r\nas far as the Lake near Guanuco, 30 leagues from Lima, where the\r\nMaragnon takes its source; and even reckoning from the source of the\r\nriver Napo, some distance from Quito, the course of the river Amazons is\r\nmore than a thousand leagues.\r\n\r\nIt might be said that the course of the river St. Lawrence, in Canada,\r\nis more than 900 leagues from its mouth to the lake Ontaro, from thence\r\nto lake Huron, afterwards to the lake Alemipigo, and to the lake\r\nAssiniboils; the waters of these lakes falling one into another, and at\r\nlast into St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nThe river Mississippi more than 700 leagues long from its mouth to any\r\nof its sources, which are not remote from the lake of the Assiniboils.\r\n\r\nThe river de la Plata is more than 800 leagues long, from the source of\r\nthe river Parana, which it receives.\r\n\r\nThe river Oroonoko runs more than 575 leagues, reckoning from the source\r\nof the river Caketa, near Pasto, part of which falls into the Oroonoko,\r\nand part flows also towards the river Amazons.\r\n\r\nThe river Madera, which falls into the Amazons, is more than 660\r\nleagues.\r\n\r\nTo know nearly the quantity of water the sea receives by all the rivers\r\nwhich fall into it, let us suppose that one half of the globe is covered\r\nby the sea, and that the other half is land, which is nearly the fact;\r\nlet us suppose also, that the mediate depth of the sea is 230 fathom.\r\nThe surface of all the earth being 170,981,012 square miles; and that of\r\nthe sea 85,490,506 square miles, which being multiplied by 1/4, the\r\ndepth of the sea gives 21,372,626, cubical miles for the quantity of\r\nwater contained in the ocean. Now, to calculate the quantity of water\r\nwhich the ocean receives from the rivers, let us take some great river,\r\nwhose rapidity and quantity of waters are known; for example, the Po,\r\nwhich runs through Lombardy, and waters a tract of land 380 miles long;\r\naccording to Riccioli, its breadth, before it divides into many\r\ntrenches, is 100 perches of Boulogne, or 1000 feet, its depth 10 feet,\r\nand it runs four miles an hour; therefore the Po supplies the sea with\r\n200,000 cubical perches of water in an hour, or 4 millions 800 thousand\r\nin a day; but a cubical mile contains 125 millions cubical perches;\r\ntherefore 26 days is required to convey a cubical mile of water to the\r\nsea: it remains therefore only to determine the proportion between the\r\nriver Po and all the rivers of the earth taken together, which is\r\nimpossible to do precisely. But to know it pretty exactly, let us\r\nsuppose that the quantity of water which the sea receives by the large\r\nrivers in all countries is proportional to the extent and surface of\r\nthese countries, and that consequently the country watered by the Po,\r\nand other rivers which fall therein, is in the same proportion on the\r\nsurface of the whole earth, as the Po is to all the rivers of the earth.\r\nNow by the most correct charts, the Po, from its source to its mouth,\r\ntraverses a tract 380 miles long, and the rivers which fall therein, on\r\neach side, proceed from the springs and rivers 60 miles distant from the\r\nPo; therefore this great river, and the others it receives, waters a\r\ntract 380 miles long, and 120 miles broad, which makes 450,600 square\r\nmiles, but the surface of all the dry land is 85,490,506 square miles;\r\nconsequently all the water which the rivers carry to the sea, will be\r\n1974 times greater than the quantity which the Po furnishes; but as 26\r\nrivers equal to the Po furnish a cubical mile of water to the sea in a\r\nday, of course 1874 rivers like the Po would supply the sea with 26,308\r\ncubical miles of water in a year, and that in the space of 812 years all\r\nthe rivers would supply the sea with 21,372,626 cubical miles of water;\r\nthat is to say, as much as there is in the ocean, and therefore 812\r\nyears is only required to fill it.[312:A]\r\n\r\nThe result of this calculation is, that the quantity of water evaporated\r\nfrom the sea, and which the winds convey on the earth, is about 245\r\nlines, or from 20 to 21 inches a year, or about two thirds of a line\r\neach day: this is a very trifling evaporation even when trebled, in\r\norder to estimate the water which refalls in the sea, and which is not\r\nconveyed over the earth. Mr. Halley, in the Phil. Transactions, page\r\n192, evidently shews, that the vapours which rise above the sea, and\r\nwhich the winds convey over all the earth, are sufficient to supply all\r\nthe rivers in the world.\r\n\r\nNext to the Nile the river Jordan is the most considerable in the\r\nLevant, or even in Barbary; it supplies the Dead Sea with about six\r\nmillion tons of water every day; all this water, and more, is raised by\r\nevaporation; for, according to Halley's calculation of 6914 tons\r\nevaporated from each mile, the Dead Sea, which is 72 miles in length by\r\n18 broad, must every day lose near nine million tons of water, that is,\r\nnot only all the water it receives from the river Jordan, but also that\r\nof the small rivers which come into it from the mountains of Moab and\r\nelsewhere; consequently there is no necessity for its communicating with\r\nany other sea by subterraneous canals.[313:A]\r\n\r\nThe most rapid rivers are the Tigris, the Indus, the Danube, the Yrtis,\r\nin Siberia, the Malmistra, in Silesia, &c. but, as we have already\r\nobserved, the proportion of the rapidity of rivers depends upon the\r\ndeclivity and upon the weight and quantity of water; by examining the\r\nglobe, we shall find that the Danube is much less inclined than the Po,\r\nthe Rhine, or the Rhone, for the Danube has a much longer course than\r\nany of these other rivers, and falls into the Black Sea, which is higher\r\nthan the Mediterranean, and perhaps more so than the ocean.\r\n\r\nAll large rivers receive many others in the extent of their course; for\r\nexample, the Danube receives more than 200 rivulets and rivers; but by\r\nreckoning only such as are considerable rivers, we shall find that the\r\nDanube receives 31, the Wolga 32, the Don 5 or 6, the Nieper 19 or 20,\r\nthe Duine 11 or 12; so likewise in Asia the Hoanho receives 34 or 35,\r\nthe Jenisca 60, the Oby as many, the Amour about 40, the Kian, or river\r\nNankin about 30, the Ganges upwards of 20, the Euphrates 10 or 11, &c.\r\nIn Africa, the river Senegal receives upwards of 20 rivers: the Nile\r\ndoes not receive any rivers for upwards of 500 miles from its mouth; the\r\nlast which falls therein is the Moraba, and from this place to its\r\nsource it receives about 12 or 13 rivers. In America, the river Amazons\r\nreceives more than 60, all of which are very considerable; the river St.\r\nLawrence about 40, by reckoning those which fall into the lakes; the\r\nMississippi more than 40, the Plata more than 50, &c.\r\n\r\nThere are high countries on the earth, which seem to be points of\r\ndivision marked by nature for the distribution of the waters. In\r\nEurope, the environs of Mount St. Goddard are one of these points;\r\nanother is situate between the provinces of Belozera and Wologda, in\r\nMuscovy, from whence many rivers descend, some of which go to the White\r\nSea, others to the Black, and some to the Caspian. In Asia there are\r\nseveral, in the country of Mogul Tartary, from whence rivers flow into\r\nNova Zembla, others to the Gulph Linchidolin, others to the sea of\r\nCorea, others to that of China: and so likewise the Little Thibet, whose\r\nwaters flow towards the sea of China; the Gulph of Bengal, the Gulph of\r\nCambay, and the Lake Aral; in America, the province of Quito; whose\r\nrivers run into the North and South Seas, and the Gulph of Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn the old continent there are about 430 rivers, which fall directly\r\ninto the ocean, or into the Mediterranean and Black Seas; but in the new\r\ncontinent not more than 145 rivers are known, which fall directly into\r\nthe sea: in this number I have comprehended only the great rivers, like\r\nthe Somme in Picardy.\r\n\r\nAll these rivers carry to the sea a great quantity of mineral and saline\r\nparticles, which they have washed from the different soils through\r\nwhich they have passed. The particles of salt, which are easily\r\ndissolved, are conveyed to the sea by the water. Some philosophers, and\r\namong the rest Halley, have pretended that the saltness of the sea\r\nproceeded only from the salts of the earth, which the rivers transport\r\ntherein. Others assert, that the saltness of the sea is as ancient as\r\nthe sea itself, and that this salt was created that the waters might not\r\ncorrupt; but we may justly suppose that the sea is preserved from\r\ncorruption by the agitations produced by the winds and tides, as much as\r\nby the salt it contains; for when put in a barrel it corrupts in a few\r\ndays; and Boyle relates, that a mariner, who was becalmed for 13 days,\r\nfound, at the end of that time, the water so infected, that if the calm\r\nhad not ceased, the greatest part of his people would have perished. The\r\nwater of the sea is also mixed with a bituminous oil, which gives it a\r\ndisagreeable taste, and renders it very unhealthful. The quantity of\r\nsalt contained in sea water is about a fortieth part, and is nearly\r\nequally saline throughout, at top as well as bottom, under the line, and\r\nat the Cape of Good Hope; although there are several places, as off the\r\nMosambique Coast, where it is salter than elsewhere.[317:A] It is also\r\nasserted not to be so saline under the Arctic Circle, which may proceed\r\nfrom the amazing quantities of snow, and the great rivers which fall\r\ninto those seas, and because the heat of the sun produces but little\r\nevaporation in hot climates.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, I conceive that the saltness of the sea is not only\r\ncaused by the banks of salt at the bottom of the sea, and along the\r\ncoasts, but also by the salts of the earth, which the rivers continually\r\nconvey therein; and that Halley had some reason to presume that in the\r\nbeginning of the world the sea had but little or no saltness; that it is\r\nbecome so by degrees, and in proportion as the rivers have brought salts\r\ntherein; that this saltness is every day increasing, and that\r\nconsequently, by computing the whole quantity of salt brought by all the\r\nrivers, we might attain the knowledge of the age of the world by the\r\ndegrees of the saltness of the sea.\r\n\r\nDivers and pearl fishers assert, according to Boyle, that the deeper\r\nthey descend into the sea, the colder is the water; and that the cold is\r\nso intense at considerable depths, that they cannot remain there so long\r\nunder water, but are obliged to come up again much sooner than when\r\nthey descended to only a moderate one. It appeared to me that the weight\r\nof the water might be as much the cause of compelling them to shorten\r\ntheir usual time as the intenseness of the cold, when they descend to a\r\ndepth of 3 or 400 fathoms; but, in fact, divers scarcely ever descend\r\nabove an hundred feet. The same author relates, that in a voyage to the\r\nEast-Indies, beyond the line, at about 35 degrees south latitude, a\r\nsounding lead of 30 or 35lb weight was sunk to the depth of 400 fathoms,\r\nand that being pulled up again, it had become as cold as ice. It is also\r\na frequent practice with mariners to cool their wine at sea by sinking\r\ntheir bottles to the depth of several fathoms, and they affirm the\r\ndeeper the bottles are sunk, the cooler is the wine.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances might induce us to presume that the sea is salter at\r\nthe bottom than at the surface; but we have testimonies which prove the\r\ncontrary, founded on experiments made to fill vessels with sea water,\r\nwhich were not opened till they were sunk to a certain depth, and the\r\nwater was found to be no salter than at the surface. There are even some\r\nplaces where the water at the surface is salt, and that at the bottom\r\nfresh; and this must always be the case where there are springs at the\r\nbottom of the sea, as near Goo, Ormus, and even in the sea of Naples,\r\nwhere there are hot springs at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThere are other places where sulphurous springs and beds of bitumen have\r\nbeen discovered at the bottom of the sea, and on land there are many of\r\nthese springs of bitumen which run into it.\r\n\r\nAt Barbadoes there is a pure bitumen spring, which flows from the rocks\r\ninto the sea: salt and bitumen, therefore, are predominant matters in\r\nthe sea water: but it is also mixed with many other matters; for the\r\ntaste of water is not the same in every part of the sea; besides, the\r\nagitation and the heat of the sun alters the natural taste which the sea\r\nshould have; and the different colour of different seas, at different\r\ntimes, prove that the waters of the sea contain several kinds of\r\nmatters, either which it loosens from its own bottom, or are brought\r\nthither by rivers.\r\n\r\nAlmost all countries watered by great rivers are subject to periodical\r\ninundations, those which are low, and derive their sources from a great\r\ndistance, overflow the most regularly. Every person almost has heard of\r\nthe inundations of the Nile, which preserves the sweetness and whiteness\r\nof its waters, though extended over a vast tract of country, and into\r\nthe sea. Strabo and other ancient authors have written that it had seven\r\nmouths, but there now remain only two which are navigable; there is a\r\nthird canal which descends to Alexandria, and fills the cisterns there,\r\nand a fourth which is still smaller; but as they have for a long time\r\nneglected to clean their canals, they are nearly choaked up. The\r\nancients employed a great number of workmen and soldiers, and every\r\nyear, after the inundation, they carried away the mud and sand which was\r\nin these canals. The cause of the overflowing of the Nile proceeds from\r\nthe rains which fall in Ethiopia. They begin in April and do not cease\r\ntill September; during the first three months, the days are serene and\r\nfair, but as soon as the sun goes down the rains begin, nor stop till it\r\nrises again, and are generally accompanied with thunder and lightning.\r\nThe inundation begins in Egypt about the 17th of June; it generally\r\nincreases during 40 days, and diminishes in about the same time; all the\r\nflat country of Egypt is overflowed; but this inundation is much less\r\nnow than it was formerly, for Herodotus tells us, that the Nile was 100\r\ndays in swelling, and as many in abating: if this is true, we can only\r\nattribute the cause thereof to the elevation of the land, which the mud\r\nof the waters has heightened by degrees, and to the diminution of the\r\nmountains in Africa, from whence it derives its source. It is very\r\nnatural to believe that these mountains have diminished, because the\r\nabundant rains which fall in these climates during half the year sweep\r\naway great quantities of sand and earth from the mountains into the\r\nvalleys, from whence the torrents wash them into the Nile, which carries\r\ngreat part into Egypt, where it deposits them in its overflowings.\r\n\r\nThe Nile is not the only river whose inundations are regular; the river\r\nPegu is called the _Indian Nile_, because it overflows regularly every\r\nyear; it inundates the country for more than 30 leagues from its banks;\r\nand, like the Nile, leaves an abundance of mud, which so greatly\r\nfertilizes the earth, that the pasturage is excellent for cattle, and\r\nrice grows in such great abundance, that every year a number of vessels\r\nare laden with it, without leaving a scarcity in the country.[321:A] The\r\nNiger, or what amounts to the same, the upper part of the Senegal,\r\nlikewise overflows and covers all the flat country of Nigritia; it\r\nbegins nearly at the same time as the Nile, and increases also for 40\r\ndays: the river de la Plata, in Brasil, also overflows every year, and\r\nat the same time as the Nile. The Ganges, the Indus, the Euphrates, and\r\nsome others, overflow annually; but all rivers have not periodical\r\noverflowings, and when inundations happen it is the effect of many\r\ncauses, which combine to supply a greater quantity of water than common,\r\nand, at the same time, to retard its velocity. We have before observed,\r\nthat in almost all rivers the inclination of their beds diminishes\r\ntowards their mouths in an almost insensible manner; but there are some\r\nwhose declivity is very sudden in some places, and forms what is termed\r\na _cataract_, which is nothing more than a fall of water, quicker than\r\nthe common current of the river. The Rhine, for example, has two\r\ncataracts, the one at Bilefield, and the other near Schafhouse: the Nile\r\nhas many, and among the rest two which are very violent, and fall from a\r\ngreat height between two mountains; the river Wologda, in Muscovy, has\r\nalso two near Ladoga; the Zaire, a river of Congo, begins by a very\r\nlarge cataract, which falls from the top of a mountain; but the most\r\nfamous is that of Niagara, in Canada, that falls from a perpendicular\r\nheight of 156 feet, like a prodigious torrent, and is more than a\r\nquarter of a mile broad: the fog, or mist, which the water makes in\r\nfalling, is perceived at five miles distance, and rises as high as the\r\nclouds, forming a very beautiful rainbow when the sun shines thereon.\r\nBelow this cataract there are such terrible whirlpools, that nothing can\r\nbe navigated thereon for six miles distance, and above the cataract the\r\nriver is much narrower than it is in the upper lands[323:A]. The\r\ndescription given of it by _Father Charlevoix_ is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"My first care, when I arrived, was to visit the most beautiful cascade\r\nthat is, perhaps, in nature; but I immediately discovered that Baron la\r\nHontain was deceived so greatly, both in its height and figure, that one\r\nmight reasonably imagine he had never seen it.\r\n\r\n\"It is true, that if we measure its height by the three mountains you\r\nare obliged to ascend in going to it, there is not much abatement to be\r\nmade of the 600 feet, which the map of M. Delisse gives it, who\r\ndoubtless advanced this paradox only on the credit of the Baron la\r\nHontain, and Father Honnepin; but after I arrived at the top of the\r\nthird mountain, I observed that in the space of three leagues, which I\r\nafterwards had to go to this fall of water, although you are forced\r\nsometimes to ascend, you must nevertheless descend still more, and this\r\nis what travellers do not appear to have paid proper attention to. As we\r\ncan only approach the cascade on one side, nor see it but in the\r\nprofile, it is not easy to measure its height by instruments:\r\nexperiments have been made to do it by a long cord, tied to a pole, and\r\nafter having often attempted this manner, it was found to be only 115 or\r\n120 feet high; but it is impossible to ascertain whether the pole was\r\nnot stopped by some projection of the rock; for although when drawn up\r\nagain the end of the cord was always wet, yet that is no proof, since\r\nthe water which precipitates from the mountain, flies up again in foam\r\nto a very great height: for my own part, after having considered it on\r\nevery side that I could examine it to advantage, I think that we cannot\r\nallow it to be less than 140 or 150 feet.\r\n\r\n\"Its figure is that of a horse-shoe, and its circumference is about 400\r\npaces; but exactly in its middle, it is divided by a very narrow\r\nisland, about half a quarter of a league long. It is true these two\r\nparts join again; that which was on my side, and of which I could only\r\nhave a side view, has several projecting points, but that which I beheld\r\nin front, appeared to be perfectly even.\" The Baron has also mentioned a\r\ntorrent, which, if not the offspring of his own invention, must fall\r\ninto some channel upon the melting of the snow.\r\n\r\nThere is another cataract three miles from Albany, in the province of\r\nNew-York, whose height is 50 feet perpendicular, and from which there\r\narises a mist that occasions a faint rainbow.[325:A]\r\n\r\nIn all countries where mankind are not sufficiently numerous to form\r\npolished societies, the ground is more irregular, and the beds of rivers\r\nmore extended, less equal, and often abound with cataracts. Many ages\r\nwere required to render the Rhone and the Loire navigable. It is by\r\nconfining waters, by directing their course, and by cleansing the bottom\r\nof rivers, that they obtain a fixed and regular course; in all countries\r\nthinly inhabited Nature is rude, and often deformed.\r\n\r\nThere are rivers which lose themselves in the sands, and others which\r\nseem to precipitate into the bowels of the earth: the Guadalquiver in\r\nSpain, the river Gottenburg in Sweden, and the Rhine itself, lose\r\nthemselves in the earth. It is asserted, that in the west part of the\r\nisland of St. Domingo there is a mountain of a considerable height, at\r\nthe foot of which are many caverns, into which the rivers and rivulets\r\nfall with so much noise, as to be heard at the distance of seven or\r\neight leagues.[326:A]\r\n\r\nThe number of rivers which lose themselves in the earth is very few, and\r\nthere is no appearance that they descend very low; it is more probable\r\nthat they lose themselves, like the Rhine, by dividing among the\r\nquantity of sand; this is very common to small rivers that run through\r\ndry and sandy soils, of which we have several examples in Africa,\r\nPersia, Arabia, &c.\r\n\r\nThe rivers of the north transport into the sea prodigious quantities of\r\nice, which accumulating, form those enormous masses so destructive to\r\nmariners. These masses are the most abundant in the Strait of Waigat,\r\nwhich is entirely frozen over the greatest part of the year, and are\r\nformed by the great flakes which the river Oby almost continually brings\r\nthere; they attach themselves along the coasts, and heap up to a\r\nconsiderable height on both sides, but the middle of the strait is the\r\nlast part which freezes, and where the ice is the lowest. When the wind\r\nceases to blow from the North, and comes in the direction of the Strait,\r\nthe ice begins to thaw and break in the middle; afterwards it loosens\r\nfrom the sides in great masses, which are carried into the high sea. The\r\nwind, which all winter blows from the north over the frozen countries of\r\nNova Zembla, renders the country watered by the Oby, and all Siberia, so\r\ncold, that even at Tobolski, which is in the 57th degree, there are no\r\nfruit trees, while at Sweden, Stockholm, and even in higher latitudes,\r\nthere are both fruit trees and pulse. This difference does not proceed,\r\nas it has been thought, from the sea of Lapland being warmer than the\r\nStraits; nor from the land of Nova Zembla being colder than Lapland; but\r\nsolely from the Baltic, and the Gulph of Bothnia, tempering the rigour\r\nof the north winds, whereas in Siberia there is nothing that can\r\ntemperate the cold. It is a fact founded on experience, that it is never\r\nso cold on the sea coasts as in the inland parts of a country. There\r\nare plants which stand the winter in London exposed to the open air,\r\nthat cannot be preserved at Paris; and Siberia, which is a vast\r\ncontinent, is for this reason colder than Sweden, which is surrounded on\r\nall sides by the sea.\r\n\r\nThe coldest country in the world is Spitzbergen: it lies in the 78th\r\ndegree of north latitude, and is entirely formed of small peaked\r\nmountains; these mountains are composed of gravel, and flat stones\r\nsomewhat like slate, heaped one on the other; which, it is affirmed by\r\nnavigators, are raised by the wind, and increase so quick, that new ones\r\nare discovered every year. The rein-deer is the only animal seen here,\r\nwhich feeds on a short grass and moss. On the top of these little\r\nmountains, and at more than a mile from the sea, the mast of a ship was\r\nfound with a pully fastened to one of its ends, which gives room to\r\nsuppose that the sea once covered the tops of these mountains, and that\r\nthis country is but of modern date; it is uninhabited, and\r\nuninhabitable; the soil of these small mountains has no consistence, but\r\nis loose, and so cold and penetrating a vapour strikes from it, that it\r\nis impossible to remain any length of time thereon.\r\n\r\nThe vessels which go to Spitzbergen for the whale fishery, arrive there\r\nearly in the month of July, and take their departure from it about the\r\n15th of August, the ice preventing them from entering the sea earlier,\r\nor quiting it after. Prodigious pieces of ice, 60, 70, and 80 fathoms\r\nthick are seen there, and there are some parts of it where the sea\r\nappears frozen to the very bottom[329:A]: this ice, which is so high\r\nabove the level of the sea, is as clear and transparent as glass.\r\n\r\nThere is also much ice in the seas of North America, as in Ascension\r\nBay, in the Straits of Hudson, Cumberland, Davis, Forbishers, &c. Robert\r\nLade asserts that the mountains of Friezeland are entirely covered with\r\nsnow, and its coasts with ice, like a bulwark, which prevents any\r\napproaching them. \"It is, says he, very remarkable, that in this sea we\r\nmeet with islands of ice more than half a mile round, extremely high,\r\nand 70 or 80 fathoms deep; this ice, which is sweet, is perhaps formed\r\nin the rivers or straits of the neighbouring lands, &c. These islands\r\nor mountains of ice are so moveable, that in stormy weather they follow\r\nthe track of a ship, as if they were drawn along in the same furrow by a\r\nrope. There are some of them tower so high above the water, as to\r\nsurpass the tops of the masts of the largest vessels.\"[330:A]\r\n\r\nIn the collection of voyages made for the service of the Dutch East\r\nIndia Company, we meet with the following account of the ice at Nova\r\nZembla:--\"At Cape Troost the weather was so foggy as to oblige us to\r\nmoor the vessel to a mountain of ice, which was 36 fathoms deep in the\r\nwater, and about 16 fathoms out of it.\r\n\r\n\"On the 10th of August the ice dividing, it began to float, and then we\r\nobserved that the large piece of ice, to which the ship had been moored,\r\ntouched the bottom, as all the others passing by struck against without\r\nmoving it. We then began to fear being inclosed between the ice, that we\r\nshould either be frozen in or crushed to pieces, and therefore\r\nendeavoured to avoid the danger by attempting to get into another\r\nlatitude, in doing of which the vessel was forced through the floating\r\nice, which made a tremendous noise, and seemingly to a great distance;\r\nat length we moored to another mountain, for the purpose of remaining\r\nthere that night.\r\n\r\n\"During the first watch the ice began to split with an inexpressible\r\nnoise, and the ship keeping to the current, in which the ice was now\r\nfloating, we were obliged to cut the cable to avoid it; we reckoned more\r\nthan 400 large mountains of ice, which were 10 fathoms under and\r\nappeared more than 2 fathoms above water.\r\n\r\n\"We afterwards moored the vessel to another mountain of ice, which\r\nreached above 6 fathoms under water. As soon as we were fixed we\r\nperceived another piece beyond us, which terminated in a point, and went\r\nto the bottom of the sea; we advanced towards it, and found it 20\r\nfathoms under water, and 12 above the surface.\r\n\r\n\"The 11th we reached another large shelve of ice, 18 fathoms under\r\nwater, and 10 above it.\r\n\r\n\"The 21st the Dutch got pretty far in among the ice, and remained there\r\nthe whole night; the next morning they moored their vessel to a large\r\nbank of ice, which they ascended, and considered as a very singular\r\nphenomenon, that its top was covered with earth, and they found near 40\r\neggs thereon. The colour was not the common colour of ice, but a fine\r\nsky blue. Those who were on it had various conjectures from this\r\ncircumstance, some contending it was an effect of the ice, while others\r\nmaintained it to be a mass of frozen earth. It was about eighteen\r\nfathoms under water, and ten above.\"[332:A]\r\n\r\nWafer relates, that near Terra del Fuega he met with many high floating\r\npieces of ice, which he at first mistook for islands. Some appeared a\r\nmile or two in length, and the largest not less than 4 or 500 feet above\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nAll this ice, as I have observed in the sixth article, was brought\r\nthither by the rivers; the ice in the sea of Nova Zembla, and the\r\nStraits of Waigat come from the Oby, and perhaps from Jenisca, and other\r\ngreat rivers of Siberia and Tartary; that in Hudson's Straits, from\r\nAscension Bay, into which many of the North American rivers fall; that\r\nof Terra del Fuega, from the southern continent. If there are less on\r\nthe North coasts of Lapland, than on those of Siberia, and the Straits\r\nof Waigat, it is because all the rivers of Lapland fall into the Gulph\r\nof Bothnia, and none go into the northern sea. The ice may also be\r\nformed in the straits, where the tides swell much higher than in the\r\nopen sea, and where, consequently, the ice that is at the surface may\r\nheap up and form those mountains, which are several fathoms high; but\r\nwith respect to those which are 4 or 500 feet high, they appear to be\r\nformed on high coasts; and I imagine that when the snow which covers the\r\ntops of these coasts melts, the water flows on the flakes of ice, and\r\nbeing frozen thereon, thus increases the size of the first until it\r\ncomes to that amazing height. That afterwards, in a warm summer, these\r\nhills of ice loosen from the coasts by the action of the wind and motion\r\nof the sea, or perhaps even by their own weight, and are driven as the\r\nwind directs, so that they at length may arrive into temperate climates\r\nbefore they are entirely melted.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[306:A] See Racolta d'autori che trattano del motto dell' acque, vol. 1,\r\npage 123.\r\n\r\n[312:A] See Keil's Examination of Burnet's Theory, page 126.\r\n\r\n[313:A] See Shaw's Travels, vol. ii, page 71.\r\n\r\n[317:A] See Boyle, vol. iii. page 217.\r\n\r\n[321:A] See Ovington's Travels, vol. ii. page 290.\r\n\r\n[323:A] See Phil.
