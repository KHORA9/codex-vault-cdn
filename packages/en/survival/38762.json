A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary course of events, most individuals take some part in the\r\nmanifold industries which engage the mind and the hand of man, by which\r\nalone our present-day civilization can be maintained. These great world\r\nactivities touch the daily life of _every_ member of society, whether\r\nchild or adult, worker or idler.\r\n\r\nA chain of mutual dependence, too often unrecognized, binds together the\r\nmembers of the human family, whether they belong to the same community\r\nor dwell on opposite sides of the earth. The links of this chain are\r\nmade up of the articles which constitute our daily food, our clothing,\r\nhomes, fuel, light, our means of communication and transportation, and\r\nonly by continuous cooeperation are they kept together.\r\n\r\nThe highest motive in education is to present the conditions which will\r\nlead to the most complete living; to build up the best possible members\r\nof society; to develop character. An individual who does not understand\r\nthe life of which he finds himself a part, cannot be in full sympathy\r\nwith its conditions and hence cannot be of the most service to himself\r\nor to others. Only to the extent that education and life follow the same\r\ngeneral course, can each be truly successful. Far too little is done in\r\nour schools to acquaint children with their relations to the great\r\nindustrial and social organization of which they are members. Even grown\r\npersons have, as a rule, a very indefinite knowledge of these relations.\r\n\r\nIt is a recognized principle that our knowledge of geography has its\r\nfoundation in our knowledge of the home. The natural connecting link\r\nbetween the immediate surroundings and the outside world is the _present\r\ndaily life of the home_. Through the industries seen in the community,\r\nthe commodities in general use, and the history of their creation and\r\nsupply, the pupil acquires an insight into the life about him as well as\r\ninto that of other parts of the world. He also realizes the great truth\r\nthat the world and its people are in intimate touch with _him_. In this\r\nway he is led back and forth along the routes which civilization has\r\nfollowed in its progress, which it also follows to-day, as mankind clasp\r\nhands across oceans and continents. Thus the remote and abstract become\r\nimmediate and concrete. Facts are seen in a setting of reason, and a\r\nlogical and interesting basis for the study of physical, climatic, and\r\nhuman conditions is furnished.\r\n\r\nThis study begins with the commodities in constant use and finally\r\nencompasses the whole world, but always with the home as the base of\r\noperations. It will create a knowledge of the interdependence of\r\nindividuals, communities, and nations, and a genuine respect for the\r\nwork of the hands and for the worker. The importance of this respect is\r\nnot likely to be overestimated. Without it a true democracy cannot long\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nReading should not only serve for the acquisition and the expression of\r\nthe thought contained in the printed page; it should, in addition,\r\nstimulate to _new_ thought--to independent power in reasoning. On this\r\naccount questions are inserted which the pupil is left to answer. These\r\nare suggestive of a much larger number, which should be worked out by\r\nthe teacher. Too many of the questions found in books do not \"stimulate\r\nthought\" or \"independent power in reasoning.\" They are purely\r\ninformatory and not at all formative.\r\n\r\nNo attempt has been made to treat every article of food. Those in most\r\ngeneral use, as well as those which will best serve to develop a\r\nknowledge of geographical conditions and of man's relation to man, have\r\nbeen chosen.\r\n\r\nA given industry is pursued in somewhat different ways in different\r\nplaces. It has not been thought wise to describe each modification in\r\nthese pages. For example, the method of handling wheat in California is\r\ndifferent from that employed in Minnesota. The value of the work will be\r\nincreased if the teacher will bring out these points.\r\n\r\n_All places mentioned should he definitely located_, both as to position\r\non the map or globe and with reference to the home. When developed from\r\nthe standpoint of direct, personal interest, a knowledge of the\r\nlocation of places as well as of other facts mentioned is most likely to\r\nbe retained.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations used have been very carefully selected for their\r\n_teaching value_. They give a clearness to mental pictures which can be\r\nderived only through observation of that which the illustrations\r\nsymbolize. Much experience in the use of geographical illustrations has\r\nshown that pupils need to be directed in their examination of them. To\r\nsecure the best results they must be made the centers of\r\nthought-developing questions.\r\n\r\nThanks are due the Pillsbury-Washburn Flour Mills Company of\r\nMinneapolis, the Swift Packing Company of Chicago, the Walter Baker\r\nCompany of Dorchester, the United Fruit Company of New Orleans, and Dr.\r\nCharles U. Shepard of Pinehurst Plantation, for the excellent\r\nillustrations furnished by them.\r\n\r\n                                      JAMES FRANKLIN CHAMBERLAIN.\r\n\r\nSTATE NORMAL SCHOOL,\r\n  LOS ANGELES, March, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            PAGE\r\n\r\n  THE PAST AND THE PRESENT                     1\r\n\r\n  THE STORY OF A LOAF OF BREAD                 7\r\n\r\n  HOW OUR MEAT IS SUPPLIED                    18\r\n\r\n  MARKET GARDENING                            32\r\n\r\n  DAIRY PRODUCTS                              41\r\n\r\n  BUTTER MAKING                               44\r\n\r\n  CHEESE                                      50\r\n\r\n  THE FISHING INDUSTRY                        54\r\n\r\n  OYSTER FARMING                              64\r\n\r\n  A RICE FIELD                                70\r\n\r\n  HOW SUGAR IS MADE                           77\r\n\r\n  BEET SUGAR                                  84\r\n\r\n  MAPLE SUGAR                                 87\r\n\r\n  WHERE SALT COMES FROM                       91\r\n\r\n  MACARONI AND VERMICELLI                     99\r\n\r\n  ON A COFFEE PLANTATION                     104\r\n\r\n  THE TEA GARDENS OF CHINA                   113\r\n\r\n  A CUP OF COCOA                             120\r\n\r\n  A CRANBERRY BOG                            131\r\n\r\n  THE COCOANUT ISLANDS OF THE PACIFIC        139\r\n\r\n  A BUNCH OF BANANAS                         146\r\n\r\n  HOW DATES GROW                             155\r\n\r\n  THE ORANGE GROVES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA   165\r\n\r\n  A VISIT TO A VINEYARD                      174\r\n\r\n  NUTTING                                    184\r\n\r\n  A WALNUT VACATION                          187\r\n\r\n  CHESTNUTS                                  193\r\n\r\n  A BAG OF PEANUTS                           195\r\n\r\n  ASSORTED NUTS                              201\r\n\r\n  A STRANGE CONVERSATION                     206\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW WE ARE FED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PAST AND THE PRESENT\r\n\r\n\r\nLong, long ago people did not live as we do to-day. Their homes were\r\nvery different from ours, for they were made of the skins of wild\r\nanimals, of the limbs and bark of trees, or of tall grasses. There were\r\nno stoves, chairs, tables, or beds in their houses. Instead of lamps,\r\ngas, or electricity, a fire on the dirt floor or in front of the house,\r\nfurnished the light.\r\n\r\nThe clothing of these people was as simple as their homes. It was made\r\nof skins and furs in cold countries and in warm countries of braided\r\ngrasses and the fibers of certain plants. You may be sure that tailors\r\nand dressmakers were not consulted as to the latest styles, for the\r\nstyles did not change and there were neither tailors nor dressmakers to\r\ntalk to. Each family made its own clothing, and there was not a sewing\r\nmachine to be found.\r\n\r\nHow would you like to use a bone for a needle? Sometimes, instead of\r\nsharpened bones, long thorns were used. The sinews of the deer, or of\r\nsome other animal, usually furnished the thread.\r\n\r\nWhen the people were in need of food, they went into the forest and\r\ngathered roots, nuts, and fruits. Wild animals were killed by means of\r\nsuch weapons as bows and arrows and spears, and fish were caught in the\r\nlakes and streams.\r\n\r\nThe food was not cooked as ours is; for, as I have told you, there were\r\nno stoves. Sometimes the meat was broiled over the fire, sometimes baked\r\nin a hole filled with ashes and coals, but it was often eaten raw. It\r\nwas not easy to have a variety of food, and there were times when it was\r\nvery difficult to obtain anything. When food was abundant, the people\r\nfeasted, and when it was scarce, they were often hungry. How would you\r\nlike to wait for your breakfast while your father went to the woods or\r\nto the river in search of something to eat?\r\n\r\nWhen the meals were prepared, they were not neatly served as yours are,\r\nbut each person took his portion and sat on the ground while he ate it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Indians at Dinner.]\r\n\r\nAll of this seems very strange to you, I know. If you live in the city,\r\nyou are accustomed to seeing the butcher, the baker, the milkman, and\r\nthe grocer call every day. There are stores where people can buy\r\nwhatever they want to eat, drink, or wear. You wonder how any one could\r\nlive in such a way as I have described, but there _are_ people who live\r\nin this fashion to-day, although you have never seen any of them. They\r\nare _uncivilized_. Where do you think they are to be found? When people\r\nlive in this way, it takes most of their time to provide themselves with\r\nthe things that are necessary to life. They have little opportunity to\r\nimprove their ways of living and of thinking.\r\n\r\nCivilized people divide their work. Some provide food, some make\r\nclothing, some build houses, and some furnish fuel. Each one does his or\r\nher part. In this way, you see, they learn to do their work better and\r\nbetter, because each gives much time and thought to one kind of work.\r\nThis plan gives each one time to study and to learn something about the\r\nworld and its people. Think how much better our homes, our clothing, and\r\nour food are, than are those of uncivilized people, and how many other\r\nadvantages we have.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--White People at Dinner.]\r\n\r\nIt is only possible to live as we do, when each one works for others as\r\nwell as for himself. If any one fails to do his part, the rest must\r\nsuffer until some one is found to take his place. It is to prepare\r\nyourself to do _your part_ in some useful work for others, that you are\r\ngoing to school day by day. You do not now know just what that work is\r\nto be, but I want you to remember that _all_ honest work is noble. It is\r\nnot so important _what work_ you do, as it is that you should do your\r\nwork _well_. No matter what your work may be, you can carry sunshine in\r\nyour face and helpfulness in your heart. If you do this, you will be\r\nknown and loved. Hard work, coarse clothes, and lack of money can never\r\nhide these things, neither will the finest of clothing cover a selfish\r\nor untruthful nature.\r\n\r\nLet us look at this dinner table loaded with good things to eat and\r\ndrink. There are bread, butter, meat, vegetables, milk, tea, fruits, and\r\nother things. You see at once that many persons must have worked to\r\nprovide this food, for only a small part of the work was done in the\r\nkitchen. If these things could but speak, they might tell you stories as\r\nwonderful as fairy tales. They have been gathered here from the fertile\r\nplains of the West, from the sunny South, from Brazil, from the islands\r\nof the Pacific Ocean, from far-off China, and even from the waters of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF A LOAF OF BREAD\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the dark granary of a farmer's barn in North Dakota once lived a\r\nmodest family of grains of wheat. The bright, warm days of the summer\r\ntime, during which they had been placed in this dark room, soon grew\r\nshorter and cooler. The swallows, whose mud nests were in the rafters\r\noverhead, told the wheat brothers that winter was coming, and then flew\r\naway to the balmy southland.\r\n\r\nSoon biting winds and blinding snow came sweeping over the level land.\r\nSometimes the farmhouse was almost hidden under the drifts, and the\r\nfarmer had to shovel out a path to the barn, so that he could feed the\r\nhorses and cattle. By and by the days grew warmer, the snow disappeared,\r\nand the birds returned one by one. The farmer and his men got out their\r\nplows and harrows, and prepared the soil for the seeds soon to be\r\nplanted.\r\n\r\nThe wheat was now shoveled into sacks and taken to the fields. Here it\r\nwas placed in great machines drawn by horses, which scattered it evenly\r\nover the land and at the same time covered it with soft soil. The men\r\nwhistled and sang as they worked, and blackbirds, bluebirds, and larks\r\nflew back and forth, singing and searching for bugs and worms, as well\r\nas for the shining kernels of wheat.\r\n\r\nThe wheat was not content to remain underground, but kept trying to push\r\nitself out into the world. One night there came a warm shower, and the\r\nnext morning what looked like tiny, green blades of grass appeared all\r\nover the field.\r\n\r\nAll through the spring and summer the wheat kept growing, and finally\r\nthere appeared at the ends of the stalks clusters of kernels, just like\r\nthose which the farmer had planted. Some of these kernels had produced\r\nfamilies of twenty or thirty. These clusters are called _heads_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Harvesting Wheat in Southern California.]\r\n\r\nAs the south wind passed over the field it brought the wheat messages\r\nfrom Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and other states, telling of\r\nrelatives who were already turning golden in the summer sunshine. One\r\nday some of the kernels thought they heard a voice from California. Do\r\nyou think they did?\r\n\r\nThe grain in some of the fields was called _winter wheat_. This was\r\nbecause the grain had been sown the autumn before, and had remained in\r\nthe ground all winter, covered by a blanket of snow. Why was it sown in\r\nthe fall? The wheat of which I am telling you was called by the farmer\r\n_spring wheat_.\r\n\r\nSoon machines, each drawn by several horses, appeared. They cut the\r\nwaving grain, and bound it up in bundles called _sheaves_. These were\r\nset up in double rows to dry, and afterward put into another machine\r\nwhich separated the kernels from the stalks, which were now called\r\n_straw_. This work the farmer calls _threshing_. See if you can find out\r\nhow this used to be done.\r\n\r\nAfter threshing, the wheat was put into sacks and taken to the nearest\r\nrailroad station. Freight cars then carried it across the level prairies\r\nto the beautiful city of Minneapolis, built beside the Falls of Saint\r\nAnthony. What river is this city on? Of what use are the falls?\r\n\r\nThere are tall buildings called _elevators_ here in which the wheat was\r\nstored for a time. Before being put into the elevators it was examined\r\nand _graded_. As there was wheat from many farms it could not be kept\r\nseparate, so each farmer was told how much he had, and how it graded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Threshing Wheat in Southern California.]\r\n\r\nSome time after this the wheat was taken to one of the great mills to be\r\nground into flour. The largest of these mills manufactures about\r\nfifteen thousand barrels of flour every day. This is the largest flour\r\nmill in the world.\r\n\r\nWhen the kernels reached the mill, they were put into machines called\r\n_separators_, to be separated from all companions such as grass seed,\r\nmustard seed, and wild buckwheat. They were then placed in an iron box\r\nin which brushes were revolving rapidly, and were _scoured_ to free them\r\nfrom fuzz and dirt. Those that were very dirty were washed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--The Flour Mills in Minneapolis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--The Largest Flour Mill in the World.]\r\n\r\nThe kernels were _steamed_, in order that the coating, called _bran_,\r\nmight not break into small pieces. This is called _tempering_. The\r\nkernels now thought that their trials were over, but they were mistaken.\r\nSoon they found themselves being _crushed_ between rollers. After they\r\ncame out they were _sifted_, and then run between other rollers. This\r\nwas repeated six times, and each time the flour was a little finer, for\r\nthe rollers were closer together. The flour was then run through tubes\r\nof flannel. These took out whatever dust it contained. It was then\r\nground still finer. The flour was then put into sacks or barrels, which\r\nwere marked for shipment to other parts of the country.\r\n\r\nOnly the wheat intended for the very best grade of flour is treated as\r\ncarefully as this was.\r\n\r\nWhat industry does the use of barrels bring in?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Grinding Wheat.]\r\n\r\nFrom the mills the flour was sent to many parts of the land to supply\r\nstores, bakeries, hotels, and homes. Some of it found its way to the\r\nbakery near your home. The bakers, in their clean suits of white,\r\nweighed the flour which they were going to use, and then added a\r\ncertain amount of water to it. Some yeast and salt were added also. This\r\nmixture they called _dough_. You have seen your mother mix or _knead_\r\ndough, I am sure. The bakers did not do the kneading with their hands,\r\nbut by means of machinery made for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Bolting Flour.]\r\n\r\nWhen the dough had been thoroughly kneaded it was left to _rise_. It is\r\nthe yeast that causes the rising. This makes the bread light and spongy.\r\nIt was then cut into loaves and placed in the oven. The ovens in the\r\nbakery are very much larger than those in your kitchen stove, for many\r\nloaves are baked at once. When a nice shade of brown appeared on the\r\nloaves, the bakers took them out of the oven by means of long shovels.\r\nSoon the delivery wagons came and were loaded with the fresh bread to be\r\ndelivered to stores and homes. This loaf was just left at the door and\r\nis still warm.\r\n\r\nSo, you see, a loaf of bread has quite a history. I have told you the\r\nlife story of this one from the time of its grandparents, who were\r\nraised on the plains of North Dakota. Would it not be interesting to see\r\neach of the people who have had something to do with its production, and\r\nto make the journey which the wheat and the flour made? You can do both\r\nin your thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW OUR MEAT IS SUPPLIED\r\n\r\n\r\nRamon lived in a plain, one-story house, built in the shade of some\r\ncottonwood trees that fringed each side of a small river in the eastern\r\npart of Colorado. A wide veranda extended entirely around the house, but\r\nthere were very few flowers and no lawn. I am afraid you would not think\r\nit a very pleasant place for a home.\r\n\r\nNot far from the _ranch house_, as it was called, were the barn and the\r\n_corrals_. A corral is a yard with a strong, high fence about it, in\r\nwhich cattle or horses may be placed. On the bottom land beside the\r\nstream, there was a corn and an alfalfa patch, besides one containing\r\nsome potatoes and garden vegetables.\r\n\r\nDuring most of the year the stream was quite shallow, and flowed quietly\r\nover its bed, but when heavy rains occurred it rose rapidly, spreading\r\nover much of the bottom land and carrying so much clay with it that it\r\nwas almost the color of coffee.\r\n\r\nExcept along the river, not a tree was in sight from Ramon's home, and\r\nit was many miles to the nearest house. For hundreds of miles both north\r\nand south, there stretched a vast plain. Little was to be seen but sand,\r\ngrass, and sagebrush. I had almost forgotten the prairie dogs, which\r\nscamper across the plain or sit up straight and motionless on a little\r\nmound of sand beside their burrows. They watch you closely, not moving\r\nunless they regard you as a dangerous creature, when, quick as a flash,\r\nthey disappear.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall is very slight in this part of the country, being less than\r\ntwenty inches a year. On this account there is little attention paid to\r\nfarming, but instead, the settlers own great herds of cattle as well as\r\nmany horses. Ramon's father is one of the _cattlemen_ of Colorado. He\r\nowns more than ten thousand head of cattle, and some of the cattlemen\r\nown twice that number. Of course such great herds of cattle must have\r\nmuch land to graze on. Some of the land is owned by the government and\r\nany one may use it. Everywhere fences are far apart. These great\r\npastures are called _ranges_.\r\n\r\nRamon's life is not much like yours. His home is far from schools,\r\nchurches, stores, or railroads. He seldom sees strangers, but he enjoys\r\nlong rides on his own pony, _Prince_. Sometimes he goes with his father\r\nand at other times he takes a gallop with one of the \"cowboys\" who herd\r\nthe cattle.\r\n\r\nThe \"cowboys\" almost live in the saddle. They are out in all kinds of\r\nweather and are not boys at all, but strong, hardy men. They wear\r\nbroad-brimmed hats, and carry long ropes called lassos or _lariats_,\r\nwith which they catch the cattle.\r\n\r\nWhere there are so many herds they sometimes get mixed up. On this\r\naccount each cattleman marks or _brands_ his animals. These brands may\r\nbe the initial letter of the owner's name, or they may be in the form of\r\na horseshoe, a cross, a circle, or a crescent.\r\n\r\nEach spring and fall the cowboys gather the cattle together. This is\r\ncalled \"rounding up\" the cattle. They are then counted and the calves\r\nborn since the last \"round up\" are branded. In the fall, in addition to\r\nthis work, animals are selected for the market. Why is the fall a better\r\ntime for this than the spring?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Branding Cattle.--Point to the Lariats.]\r\n\r\nThe cowboys, mounted upon their swift, strong ponies, single out the\r\nanimals that have never been branded, and swinging their lassos over\r\ntheir heads, they throw them with such skill that the loop settles over\r\nthe head or about the leg of the one wanted. As soon as the rope\r\ntightens, the pony braces its forefeet firmly and the animal is finally\r\nthrown to the ground. It is then branded with a hot iron and allowed to\r\ngo. Ramon used to feel very sorry for them until his father explained\r\nthat it hurt them very little, for only the skin was burned.\r\n\r\nSometimes the cattle selected to be sold, are not quite fat enough for\r\nthe market. They are then taken farther east into the _corn belt_ and\r\nfed for a time.\r\n\r\nWhen they are shipped directly from the range to the market, they are\r\ndriven to the nearest railroad and put into yards beside the track. They\r\nare then made to walk up an incline with high railings ending at the\r\nopen doors of a cattle car. The animals are arranged so that the first\r\nfaces one side of the car, the second the other, and so on. This is done\r\nso that the cattle cannot hook one another, and also that they may be\r\nfed and watered on the way from a long iron trough which is fastened to\r\neach side of the car.\r\n\r\nThe great cattle markets of the United States are Omaha, Kansas City,\r\nand Chicago. Find these cities.\r\n\r\nOne day when Ramon was about fourteen years old, his father told him\r\nthat he was going to take a train load of cattle to Chicago and that he\r\nmight go with him. It was a happy time for Ramon, you may be sure, for\r\nhe was very anxious to see some of the wonderful sights his father had\r\ntold him about.\r\n\r\nAt last the day when they were to start on their journey arrived. The\r\nafternoon before, the cowboys had driven the cattle to the railroad so\r\nas to load them early in the morning. Soon after breakfast Ramon kissed\r\nhis mother and his little sister good-by, and he and his father rode off\r\nacross the level plain.\r\n\r\nFinding the cattle already loaded in the cars, Ramon and his father were\r\nsoon seated in the _caboose_, rolling over the miles of railroad which\r\nconnected them with Chicago. Whenever the train stopped for a few\r\nminutes, they took a long stick and went from car to car making the\r\ncattle that had lain down get up, so that they might not be injured by\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nWhen bedtime came, they made their beds on the benches along each side\r\nof the caboose, which are covered with cushions. As they had brought\r\nblankets with them, they were fairly comfortable.\r\n\r\nRamon did not sleep very soundly the first night. The engine shrieked\r\nfrom time to time, and the car rocked and jolted so that he was afraid\r\nof falling from his bed.\r\n\r\nThe next day they reached a part of the country where great cornfields\r\nwaved in the breeze. The leaves had already turned brown, and golden\r\nears of grain peeped out from the ends of the husks. There were stubble\r\nfields, too, where wheat and oats had been harvested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Bird's Eye View of Union Stock Yards, Chicago.]\r\n\r\nThe country became more thickly settled as they went on, and the towns\r\nwere nearer together. Streams were more common, and grass and timber\r\nmore abundant. The young traveler wondered why this was so. Can you\r\ntell?\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of the fourth day the train reached Chicago. After\r\nmuch switching and backing the cars were run into the Union Stock Yards,\r\nand the cattle were unloaded.\r\n\r\nRamon was thoroughly bewildered by what he saw and heard. Men were\r\nshouting and cracking whips; others were riding up and down the alleys\r\nthat separate the yards; dogs were barking and turning the animals this\r\nway and that, and gates were swinging back and forth.\r\n\r\nThe cattle were weighed and examined to see if they had any disease, and\r\nwere then placed in charge of a _commission merchant_ to be sold. Buyers\r\ncome to the yards and bargain with these commission merchants. When an\r\nunusually large number of cattle come in, the prices are likely to fall;\r\nwhen few arrive, the prices rise.\r\n\r\nWhen the cattle had been yarded, Ramon's father said that they would go\r\nand have breakfast. In the afternoon they visited the \"yards,\" and the\r\nslaughter and packing houses. The \"yards\" cover about a square mile of\r\nterritory. They are divided into countless pens or small yards,\r\ncontaining sheds, feeding racks, and watering troughs.\r\n\r\nRamon asked how many cattle were unloaded in these yards daily. His\r\nfather handed him a copy of the _Chicago Live Stock World_, and at the\r\ntop of the first column he read that on the day previous there had been\r\nreceived 18,500 cattle, 35,000 hogs, and 18,000 sheep. He was told that\r\nsometimes the receipts are much larger than this and sometimes not so\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Dressing Beef.]\r\n\r\nThey followed the bodies of the cattle from the slaughterhouses where\r\nthey are dressed, into the cooling rooms. These are simply great\r\nrefrigerators. Wagons come to the cooling rooms and haul loads of the\r\nmeat to butcher shops, hotels, and depots. Within a few hours it finds\r\nits way to smaller cities and towns in all directions. A great deal of\r\nmeat is shipped even to Europe. Why does not Europe produce its own\r\nmeat?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Cooling Beef.]\r\n\r\nWhen the meat has thoroughly hardened in the cooling rooms, it is sent\r\nto the curing rooms, where it is cut up and packed. Each person here\r\ndoes his particular work from morning until night.\r\n\r\nRamon learned, to his surprise, that every part of the animal is used.\r\nHair, hide, horns, hoofs, teeth, bones, and even blood, are made use of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Splitting Backbone of Hogs.]\r\n\r\nMost of the hogs which enter the great meat-packing cities are raised in\r\nthe corn belt.\r\n\r\nThe sheep need much pasturage, and so the largest flocks are found in\r\nthe Western and Southwestern states. A single herder may take care of\r\nseveral thousand sheep. His faithful companions and helpers are\r\nintelligent shepherd dogs. After a great flock of sheep has fed on an\r\narea, hardly a green thing is left. The people in the part of the West\r\nwhere there is little rainfall, object to the pasturing of sheep around\r\nthe head waters of streams, because when the vegetation is removed the\r\nwater runs off too quickly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Curing Pork in Salt.]\r\n\r\nIn the evening our friends watched the men, women, and children march\r\nout of the \"yards.\" They were told that not less than thirty-five\r\nthousand persons were employed in the various establishments. There is\r\nbut one city in Colorado which contains so many people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Chopping Sausage Meat.]\r\n\r\nAs they sat at breakfast next morning, Ramon wondered how many of the\r\npeople of Chicago were eating steaks from cattle which he had seen on\r\nhis father's ranch. The thought was a new one to him. His trip had shown\r\nhim that the cattlemen who lived and worked on those far-away plains\r\nwere doing their part in supplying people all over our country with\r\nmeat. Their lonely life, with all of its disadvantages, now had a new\r\nmeaning for him, and he went back to his Western home content with it,\r\nyet very glad to have had this glimpse of another side of life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Packing Poultry.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKET GARDENING\r\n\r\n\r\nThink of the immense quantities of fruits and vegetables that are used\r\ndaily on the tables of a great city such as New York or Chicago. As we\r\ntravel up and down the streets of any great city, we see rows of\r\nbuildings, sometimes built in solid blocks and sometimes a little\r\ndistance apart. Some have trees and small lawns in front of them; others\r\nare without even this touch of nature. Nowhere, except in the outskirts,\r\ndo we find gardens.\r\n\r\n_These people depend upon others to furnish them with their vegetable\r\nfood._\r\n\r\nNow let us make some excursions into the region surrounding one of these\r\ncities. For miles and miles we see on every hand _truck farms_ or\r\n_market gardens_. The main business of those who live in these districts\r\nis to furnish food for the people of the city, so that the latter may\r\ndevote their time to their various occupations.\r\n\r\nWe see growing potatoes, cabbages, tomatoes, beans, peas, squashes,\r\nturnips, onions, sweet corn, celery, melons, and many other things.\r\nUsually all of these will be found in one garden, but sometimes the\r\nfarmer raises only a few kinds, or perhaps but one.\r\n\r\nMarket gardening is very common in Germany, Holland, Italy, China, and\r\nin other densely populated countries. Therefore we often find people who\r\nhave come from these countries to America engaged in this business.\r\nChinese gardeners are seldom seen in the East, but on the Pacific coast\r\nthey raise most of the vegetables used in the cities and towns.\r\n\r\nIn the early spring, before the ground is warm enough to make seeds\r\ngrow, the gardener starts his plants in \"hotbeds.\" These are long wooden\r\nboxes, or frames, without bottoms, covered with glass. They are usually\r\nplaced on the south side of some building or high fence. The glass\r\ncovers allow the warm sunshine to enter the \"beds\" freely, but they\r\nprevent the rapid escape of the heat. You see now why they are called\r\n\"hotbeds.\" They are like small greenhouses.\r\n\r\nA little later in the spring the fields are thoroughly cultivated and\r\nthe plants transplanted. Of course only the vegetables desired for the\r\nearly market are started in this way. What advantage is there in having\r\nthe vegetables ready for the market very early in the season?\r\n\r\nVegetable farming is not easy work, although it is a pleasure to see\r\nthings grow day by day as you care for them, and as nature supplies her\r\nsunshine and her rain. The fields must be cultivated almost constantly,\r\nto keep the soil loose, as well as to remove the weeds. Much of the\r\nweeding has to be done by hand, which is tedious work.\r\n\r\nWe want our vegetables fresh every morning; and as the truck farms are\r\nat some distance from the city, the farmer must load up his wagon the\r\nnight before. Of course much produce is sent to the cities on trains,\r\nbut where farmers live near enough to deliver it themselves, their crops\r\nare more profitable to them. Why?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--A Market Scene.]\r\n\r\nEverything is put in readiness before dark; and while others are still\r\nin bed, the farmer mounts his wagon to start toward the sleeping city. I\r\nhave often ridden ten or fifteen miles on such a load before the stars\r\nfaded away.\r\n\r\nIt is a novel experience. At first the night seems strangely still, but\r\nsoon you are able to distinguish many voices coming from various places.\r\nThe frogs croak from the ponds by the roadside; crickets and locusts\r\nsend their shrill notes from grass and tree; a night owl startles you by\r\nhis dismal hoot; the lamps of the fireflies gleam, then disappear only\r\nto shine out again a little farther on.\r\n\r\nAt last a faint glow appears in the eastern sky, which grows brighter\r\nand brighter until the shining face of the sun is pushed above the\r\nhorizon. Do you not think such a ride would be more enjoyable than a\r\nstreet car ride?\r\n\r\nIn the cities there are market places where produce from the country is\r\ntaken. In Chicago there is a very busy street where much of the buying\r\nand selling is done. Study the picture carefully. Here the buyers from\r\nhotels, restaurants, and stores, as well as the men who wish to peddle\r\nthe produce from house to house, go for their daily supplies. There are\r\nalso commission merchants whose stores are on this street. They sell the\r\nproduce for those who ship it to the city by train.\r\n\r\nWe go to the stores and get what we want each day, or the peddlers bring\r\nit to the door. You see how necessary it is to have special workers to\r\nsupply us with the different kinds of food. We consider it very\r\nimportant that we should have vegetables and fruits fresh daily. The\r\nwork of supplying us with this food is very important. Remember that\r\nthose who till the soil are entitled to as great respect as are those\r\nwho do not work with their hands. Contact with nature makes men and\r\nwomen better, and many of the noblest souls that the world has known\r\nhave lived in the country and plowed, planted, and harvested the\r\nproducts of the soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Market Scene. Chicago.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Market Scene. New York.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAIRY PRODUCTS\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Ben lives on a dairy farm in the western part of New York State.\r\nIt is a beautiful _rolling_ country with cultivated fields, woodland,\r\nand pastures, and here and there a sparkling stream winding its way\r\nthrough the lowlands. The farmhouses are large and well built, and are\r\nsurrounded by grand old maple, beech, and elm trees. Most of the barns\r\nare painted red with white trimmings.\r\n\r\nThere are many dairy farms in the neighborhood. Some of the farmers send\r\ntheir milk to the towns to be used directly, some sell it to creameries,\r\nand some to cheese factories.\r\n\r\nLast summer I spent my vacation on Uncle Ben's farm, and Cousin Frank\r\nand I had happy times, you may be sure.\r\n\r\nEvery day, just before sundown, we went to the pasture for the cows.\r\nThere were about twenty-five of them, and they always seemed perfectly\r\ncontented after the long day of feasting on rich grass and clover.\r\n\r\nAfter we drove them into the barnyard Uncle Ben helped us fasten them in\r\ntheir _stanchions_ in the barn. Then the men brought the bright pails\r\nand cans to begin milking. Cousin Frank and I always helped, although he\r\ncan milk much faster than I. Some of the cows gave but two or three\r\nquarts, while others gave as many gallons.\r\n\r\nWe strained the milk into cans holding eight gallons each, and put them\r\ninto tanks of water to cool. After milking was finished we turned the\r\ncattle into the barnyard for the night.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we commenced milking about sunrise. After breakfast the\r\ncans were loaded into a spring wagon and Uncle Ben drove to the depot.\r\nHere they were put on the \"milk train,\" which took them to the city.\r\n\r\nMany other people sent milk on this same train. It was sent to bakeries,\r\nto hotels and restaurants, and to milkmen, who delivered it from house\r\nto house. Usually the milkmen put the milk into pint or quart bottles\r\nfor people who like to have it in that form. Uncle Ben told us that\r\nmuch of the milk that is sent to New York City is bottled before it is\r\nsent. The bottling is done by machinery. He also told us that, because\r\nof the great importance of having pure milk, there are, in all cities,\r\ninspectors who carefully examine the milk and report to the Board of\r\nHealth. The cows also are inspected, and if any are sick, they are\r\nusually killed.\r\n\r\nEach evening some one drove to the depot again to get empty cans which\r\nthe milk train had brought home. These were always carefully washed in\r\nhot water before being used again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTER MAKING\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, after I had been on the farm about a week, Uncle Ben took Frank\r\nand me to the _creamery_. A creamery is a place where the milk and cream\r\nare separated and butter is made.\r\n\r\nWe found several wagonloads of milk being unloaded. The milk was weighed\r\nas it was received, for it is sold by weight.\r\n\r\nThe milk was then strained into a large galvanized iron tub, from which\r\na pipe carried it into a circular machine called the _separator_. The\r\nseparator revolves rapidly, throwing the milk, which is heavier than the\r\ncream, to the outer edge, where it passes through small holes into a\r\ncompartment by itself. The cream rises along the center and passes\r\nthrough another set of openings into a special compartment. A pipe\r\ncarries it to a large vat, while another pipe conveys the milk to large\r\ntanks.\r\n\r\nUncle Ben told me that when people make their own butter, they must wait\r\nfor the cream to _rise_ on the milk. The cream is then skimmed off, and\r\nthe milk is called _skimmed milk_. Although the milk in the creamery is\r\nnot skimmed, the same name is used for it.\r\n\r\nI asked if the skimmed milk was used for anything. Uncle Ben gave me a\r\ncupful of it to taste. It was very good. He then told me that the\r\nseparator takes out only the part needed in making butter, leaving all\r\nof the sugar. I did not know before that milk contains sugar.\r\n\r\nThe farmers take home loads of this milk to feed it to their hogs. For\r\neach hundred pounds of milk delivered, they get back seventy-five pounds\r\nof skimmed milk, besides the pay for their cream.\r\n\r\nThe creamery man told me that he made from four to six pounds of butter\r\nfrom one hundred pounds of milk.\r\n\r\nThe cream remains in the large vat about twenty-four hours before it is\r\nchurned. The churn, as you see by the picture, is a great barrel made\r\nto revolve by machinery. It takes from thirty-five minutes to one hour\r\nto churn. The man told me that I might look at the book in which he kept\r\nthe record of the churning. I saw that he made from two hundred fifty to\r\nsix hundred pounds of butter at a churning. He said that some churns\r\nwould produce more than one thousand pounds at a churning.\r\n\r\nNot all of the cream is made into butter. There is left in the bottom of\r\nthe churn a liquid called _buttermilk_. This is drawn off, and the\r\nbutter is washed and _worked_ before being taken out of the churn. The\r\nworking is done by means of paddles in the churn. It continues for six\r\nor eight minutes and squeezes the liquid out of the butter.\r\n\r\nWhile the butter is being worked, it is salted. Some of the butter is\r\nunsalted, but most of it is salted. When butter is made in the home, it\r\nmust be churned by hand. Only a few pounds at a time can be made in this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWhen the butter was taken out of the churn, the men packed it solidly in\r\nwooden boxes about two feet square and four inches deep. The bottom\r\nof each box consisted of strips as wide as a _square_ of butter. These\r\nwere held together by a clamp, and the sides were hooked to the bottom\r\nand to one another. When the butter is to be cut into squares, these\r\nsides are removed and zinc ones take their places. In these there are\r\nslits running from top to bottom. Through these slits a wire saw is run,\r\nand so the butter is quickly cut into one or two pound squares. The\r\nbutter is then wrapped in fancy papers upon which the name of the butter\r\nor of the creamery is stamped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Separator.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Churn.]\r\n\r\nOf course some of the butter is packed in wooden tubs and shipped in\r\nthat form. This butter is a little cheaper than that put up in squares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESE\r\n\r\n\r\nI was so much pleased with my visit to the creamery, that Uncle Ben\r\npromised to show me how cheese is made. So one morning just after\r\nbreakfast he, Cousin Frank, and I started out. After a pleasant ride of\r\nabout five miles we reached the factory.\r\n\r\nThe first process here was the same as that at the creamery. After the\r\nmilk was weighed it was run into great zinc-lined vats. There were four\r\nof these in the factory, each of which held about five thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nUncle Ben explained that the milk must _curdle_ before cheese can be\r\nmade. In order to make it curdle quickly, a little less than a pound of\r\na substance called _rennet_ was put into each vat.\r\n\r\nA man worked at each vat with a long wooden rake, stirring the milk\r\nconstantly. I saw a glass tube standing in the milk and asked what it\r\nwas. Uncle Ben told me to look at it closely. I saw that it was a\r\nthermometer, and that it registered eighty degrees. A little while after\r\nI looked again, when it showed a temperature of ninety degrees. The milk\r\nis kept warm, so as to help it to curdle quickly.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour I could see the curd very plainly, but the men kept on\r\nstirring and cutting it. Presently one of them carried a piece of the\r\ncurd to a table. He heated a small iron rod and touched it with the\r\ncurd. When he pulled the curd away, little threads were drawn out to the\r\nlength of half an inch or more. This he called the \"acid test,\" which\r\nshowed that the curd was in the right condition to be made into cheese.\r\n\r\nOf course only a part of the milk had turned into curd; the rest was\r\n_whey_, that was drawn off and run into tanks. Each man who had\r\ndelivered one hundred pounds of milk was given a check for seventy-five\r\npounds of the whey. It is fed to hogs. About two hours from the time\r\nthat the milk was put into the vats, the whey was drawn off.\r\n\r\nOne of the men now took a long knife and cut the curd into oblong cakes.\r\nThese he frequently lifted and turned over. After continuing this for\r\nabout twenty minutes, the pieces of curd were put into a small mill,\r\nplaced on a board over the vat, and the curd was chopped into strips\r\nfrom one to six inches long and from one-half an inch to an inch thick.\r\nSalt was scattered over the mass by one man, while another pitched it\r\nabout with a three-pronged wooden fork. The man told me that he used\r\nthree pounds of salt to each thousand pounds of milk.\r\n\r\nNext, a piece of cloth was placed on a board about sixteen inches\r\nsquare. Two circular metal frames or bands, about six inches high, were\r\nfitted one within the other and placed on the cloth. The frame was\r\nfilled with curd, covered by a cloth, and another set placed on top of\r\nit until there were five. They were then put on a table directly under a\r\nblock which was fastened to a screw. By turning the screw the block was\r\npressed against the top board, and so each frame of curd was pressed. I\r\nsaw the whey running out as the squeezing went on. The superintendent\r\ntold us that the curd would be left in the press until the next day.\r\n\r\nWe were then taken into the room where the cheese \"ripens.\" Here we saw\r\nlarge racks reaching nearly to the ceiling, filled with double rows of\r\ncheeses. The smallest ones weighed but three pounds, while the largest\r\nweighed fifty pounds. It may take but a few days and it may take many\r\nmonths to \"ripen\" a cheese. It depends upon the flavor wanted. The man\r\nsaid that in England \"strong\" cheese is generally liked, while in our\r\ncountry \"mild\" cheese is preferred.\r\n\r\nI asked how much cheese five thousand pounds of milk would make, and was\r\ntold that it would make between four and five hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nOn the way home Uncle Ben told us that although our country is a great\r\ndairy country, we import certain kinds of cheese from Europe. He told us\r\nhow the Swiss people pasture their cattle on the steep mountain sides,\r\nand that in every little mountain valley cheese is made, some of which\r\nfinds its way over the mountains and across the sea to the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FISHING INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever stood by the side of a stream and watched the fish dart\r\nfrom one shadow of overhanging rock into another, or swim lazily at the\r\nbottom of some deep pool? How gracefully they move and turn! How like\r\nwater jewels they flash as the sunlight falls upon them!\r\n\r\nMost streams and lakes, like the ocean, contain fish. So we have\r\nfresh-water and salt-water fish. There are a few bodies of water so full\r\nof salt that fish cannot live in them. Do you know of any such bodies of\r\nwater?\r\n\r\nMost of the fish used as food come from the ocean. In this, and in most\r\nother countries, there are many men who do nothing but fish, in order\r\nthat other people may be supplied with this sort of food. They do not\r\ndepend upon hook and line alone, but use nets also.\r\n\r\nNets are great sacks made of cord, knotted or woven together in such a\r\nway as to leave spaces or _meshes_. These meshes are not big enough to\r\nallow large fish to escape. Sometimes the fishermen go out in rowboats\r\nsome distance from shore and then throw the net into the water. Corks or\r\nfloats keep the upper edge of the net near the surface, while weights\r\nhold the lower edge on the bottom. Ropes are fastened to each end, and\r\nso it is drawn toward the shore. How the fishermen wish that they could\r\nsee to the bottom of the restless water and know what their harvest is\r\nto be! When the boats have almost reached the shore, horses are\r\nsometimes driven into the water and hitched to the ropes. At last the\r\nnet is dragged out upon the sands and the uncertainty is past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Drying Nets.]\r\n\r\nLook! Within the folds of the net is a countless number of fishes, each\r\njumping, squirming, wriggling, trying to get back to its ocean home.\r\nThey are of many sizes, shapes, and colors. Those not good for food,\r\ntogether with the smallest ones, are thrown back into the water.\r\n\r\nSometimes a net called a \"dip-net\" is dropped from a fishing schooner\r\nand drawn about a \"school\" of fish. I have seen many barrels of fish\r\nbrought up at one time in this way.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen keep a close watch for the appearance of these \"schools,\"\r\nyou may be sure. Whales and dolphins pursue them, and gulls and\r\ncormorants circle overhead, for they, too, are fishers. Their\r\nappearance helps the men to tell where the \"schools\" are. There is a\r\ngreat rush for the fishing grounds when they are sighted. The\r\nwhite-sailed schooners skim over the waters almost like a flock of\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--A Fishing Schooner.]\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of fish are caught by a method called _trawl fishing_.\r\nThis may be carried on miles from the shore. How do you suppose it is\r\ndone? To a very long and strong line, many shorter ones, each with a\r\nhook at the end, are attached. These lines, to which large buoys are\r\nfastened, are left in the water for several hours, and then fishermen in\r\nflat-bottomed boats called _dories_ row out from the schooner and\r\nexamine them. The lines are then reset and the fish taken to the\r\nschooner to be dressed. This is a common method of catching codfish,\r\nwhich is carried on during summer and winter alike. Storms and fogs are\r\nlikely to occur while the men are out in their little boats, making\r\ntheir work full of danger as well as of hardship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Splitting Codfish.]\r\n\r\nMany of the fish are packed in ice and sold fresh, while others are\r\ncured on the boats or on shore. Some of the fishing schooners carry\r\ngreat quantities of salt when they start out on a trip. The fish are\r\ndressed and packed in this. Sometimes they are packed in brine, and\r\nalong the shores of some countries they are strung on poles to dry.\r\n\r\nCodfish are dried in great quantities along the New England coast by\r\nplacing them on frames made of strips of wood and raised a little above\r\nthe wharf, so that the air can circulate freely. When the skin and bones\r\nare removed and the flesh cut into strips, it is called \"shredded\"\r\ncodfish.\r\n\r\nThe principal food-fish are the cod, mackerel, herring, halibut, shad,\r\nsalmon, sardines, and whitefish. Whitefish are caught in the Great\r\nLakes. To this list the lobster may be added, although it is not a fish.\r\n\r\nA common method of catching lobsters is to sink a box made of lath to\r\nthe bottom, where they crawl about on the rocks. A fish head is placed\r\nin the box for bait. The lobsters crawl in and are likely to remain\r\nuntil the box is examined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Drying Codfish.]\r\n\r\nLobster steamers, fitted up with tanks containing salt water, run from\r\nNova Scotia and Newfoundland to Boston and New York. Here those not\r\nwanted are placed on cars containing similar tanks and sent to interior\r\ncities. In this way fresh lobsters are served thousands of miles from\r\nwhere they were caught.\r\n\r\nA lobster that would cost us from twenty-five to seventy-five cents\r\nbrings the fisherman not more than ten cents.\r\n\r\nAlong our New England coast there are many towns engaged extensively in\r\nfishing. Portland, Gloucester, Boston, and Provincetown are among the\r\nnumber. Gloucester is the most important fishing town in the United\r\nStates. From it fishing schooners go as far as Newfoundland, Greenland,\r\nIceland, and even to the coast of Ireland. There are also important\r\nfisheries on the Pacific coast, from San Francisco to Alaska. Here the\r\nsalmon are taken in great numbers. They weigh from twenty to one hundred\r\npounds. The fish are canned and shipped to all parts of the country.\r\nBesides being caught in nets and traps and on lines many are caught in\r\n\"fish wheels.\" These are fastened to the stern of a boat and revolve in\r\nthe water. The fish are caught in pockets and dropped in the boat as the\r\nwheel brings them up over it.\r\n\r\nThere are very extensive fisheries along the shores of the British Isles\r\nand on the western coast of Europe. Fishing is the chief industry in\r\nthe towns along the coast of Norway. The air is full of the odor of\r\nfish, while drying fish, nets, and boats are everywhere in sight.\r\n\r\nAlthough the supply of fish in the ocean is very great, it is\r\ndiminishing, especially near the shore. Most countries now pay\r\nconsiderable attention to the raising of both fresh and salt water\r\nfishes, and they have passed laws regulating fishing. Eggs are hatched\r\nin great _hatcheries_, from which the young fish are taken where they\r\nare most needed.\r\n\r\nThe great ocean is free to all to sail over or fish in at will. There is\r\na narrow strip along the shore three miles wide, which belongs to the\r\ncountry which it borders. The men of other countries are not allowed to\r\nfish there.\r\n\r\nThe fisherman is a brave and sturdy man. His life is full of danger. He\r\nbattles constantly with the winds and the waves. Fogs may hide the sharp\r\nrocks which seem to wait for a chance to destroy his little vessel.\r\nSometimes icebergs or great ocean steamers sink his boat and he is never\r\nseen again.\r\n\r\nWhen storms are raging and night has settled over sea and land, and\r\nangry waves are dashing themselves into foam against the shore, the\r\nmothers, wives, and children look anxiously from their cottage windows\r\ntoward the sea, and pray that their loved ones may return to them in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOYSTER FARMING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt sounds strange to speak of farming in the ocean, but there are many\r\nand large oyster farms all along our coast. Some of these farms are\r\ncovered by water all of the time and some are uncovered when the tide is\r\nlow. Oyster farms are far more profitable than are those upon which corn\r\nand wheat are raised.\r\n\r\nThis is a new industry in our country because civilized people have not\r\nlived here very long, but it is a very old one in some parts of the\r\nworld. As long ago as the seventh century a Roman knight raised oysters\r\nfor the market, and it is said that the business made him very wealthy.\r\n\r\nYou will understand better about the cultivation of oysters, if I tell\r\nyou first how they live and grow in their natural homes.\r\n\r\nExcept during the first few days of their lives, oysters are prisoners.\r\nThey cannot move about freely from place to place as fishes and most\r\nanimals can, but they are attached to rocks, to the shells of their dead\r\nrelatives, and to other objects. How, then, do you suppose they get\r\ntheir food? They grow in immense numbers, and they crowd one another\r\nmore than people do in the tenement houses in our great cities. In fact\r\nmost of them are soon crowded out, and they die, leaving room for the\r\nrest to grow upon their empty homes. In this way the oyster beds spread\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThese oyster beds are not found in very deep water, but rather along the\r\nshore, generally near the mouth of some river. As I have told you, they\r\noften live where they are uncovered when the tide goes out. You can see\r\nfrom this that it is not very difficult to gather oysters, so that,\r\npartly on this account, man has used them for food for ages.\r\n\r\nWhen the Pilgrim Fathers landed on the shores of New England, they found\r\nthat the Indians used oysters very commonly. All along the coast were\r\ngreat heaps of the shells. At the very first Thanksgiving dinner given\r\nin America, oysters were served.\r\n\r\nOysters used to be so plentiful on these natural beds that they were\r\nvery cheap. In some places where the winter weather was cold enough to\r\nfreeze the water along the shore, people cut holes in the ice and\r\ngathered them by means of long-handled rakes.\r\n\r\nIn a single year an oyster will produce more than a million young ones.\r\nJust think of it! If all of this family grew up, they would fill a room\r\nfourteen feet in each dimension.\r\n\r\nThese young oysters are _very_ small. They are called \"spat.\" Most of\r\nthem are drifted away by waves and currents, or devoured by larger sea\r\nanimals. The few that escape soon attach themselves to some object, so\r\ngetting a chance to begin the battle of life.\r\n\r\nIf oysters are caught at all times of the year it does not give them a\r\nchance to produce their young, and this, as well as catching the young\r\nones themselves, has destroyed many of the natural beds. In order to\r\nkeep up the supply of this food men commenced oyster farming. You see\r\nhow our daily needs and desires lead to the establishment of great\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nThe oyster farmer prepares his farm in various ways. He places clean\r\noyster shells, stones, trays, bundles of sticks, and other things on the\r\nbottom, so that the oysters may find something to which to attach\r\nthemselves. Then he places the young oysters or \"spat\" on these objects.\r\nWhen trays are used, several are placed one upon another and bound\r\ntogether by means of a chain. These trays are taken up from time to time\r\nin order to gather the oysters that are ready for market.\r\n\r\nStones are sometimes piled on the bottom and the \"spat\" are placed in\r\nthe crevices between them. Often stakes are planted in a somewhat\r\ncircular form. Cords are attached to the stakes, to which bundles of\r\nsticks are fastened in such a way as to keep them a little above the\r\nbottom. Young oysters attach themselves to these sticks, which may be\r\ndrawn up when the proper time comes.\r\n\r\nShells are used more commonly than other things. They are taken from the\r\nrestaurants and hotels to the farms in boat loads, to be scattered over\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\nThe young oysters grow at very different rates. In two years they may\r\ngrow to be six inches in length, or it may take several years to reach\r\nthat size. They grow more rapidly on the artificial beds, and are better\r\nin quality also. The starfish is one of the greatest enemies of the\r\noyster, large numbers of which it destroys every year.\r\n\r\nDuring the fishing season the oyster men go to the beds in their boats\r\nand scoop the oysters up from the bottom. This is called dredging. The\r\nscoops with their loads of oysters are drawn to the deck of the boat by\r\nmachinery. Sometimes the oysters are gathered by means of long tongs.\r\n\r\nAs the oysters are usually in clusters, these have to be broken up. For\r\nthis purpose a sort of a hammer known as a _culling iron_ is used. The\r\noysters are broken apart and sorted. Sometimes the oyster man makes\r\nthree grades and sometimes four.\r\n\r\nOysters are not the only things drawn up in the dredge. Starfish,\r\nlobsters, and various kinds of fishes are gathered in. The starfish are\r\nkilled and the rest thrown back.\r\n\r\nThe oysters are heaped up in great piles on the deck of the boat. Sacks\r\nand barrels are filled with them, and many car loads are shipped daily\r\nfrom the cities near the fishing grounds. Chesapeake Bay is the center\r\nof the oyster industry in our country. Find it. There are oyster beds,\r\nhowever, all along both the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts.\r\n\r\nGreat quantities of oysters are canned near where they are caught.\r\nGetting them out of their shells is not an easy matter. For this purpose\r\na knife is used. This work is called in the South \"shucking oysters.\"\r\nCanning oysters is an important industry in the city of Baltimore. Have\r\nyou ever seen cans of oysters that came from there?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA RICE FIELD\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you do not feel quite satisfied with your breakfast, dinner, or\r\nsupper, and think that there should be a greater variety of food on the\r\ntable, just come with me and we will visit some of the boys and girls of\r\nfar-away China. What do you suppose _their_ chief article of food is?\r\nRice. Rice in the morning, rice at noon, and rice at night. Rice from\r\nthe beginning to the end of the year. In the poorer families a bit of\r\ndried fish and some vegetables are usually eaten with it. Those who can\r\nafford such things have bits of preserved ginger, mushrooms, and barley\r\ncakes with the rice. Of course the rich people have other things to eat,\r\nbut most of the people of China are poor.\r\n\r\nIn the fertile portions of China the people live very close together.\r\nGardens take the place of farms. Workmen often receive no more than ten\r\ncents a day. On this account they cannot afford the variety of food\r\nthat we have, but must be content with whatever is cheap and nourishing\r\nfor their labor. If the rice crop were to fail, the Chinese would\r\nsuffer. You will see how important this food is to them, when I tell you\r\nthat they are forbidden by law to sell rice to other countries.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you are wondering where the rice that we use in this country\r\ncomes from. Rice is grown in great quantities in Japan, Corea,\r\nIndo-China, Ceylon, India, the Philippines, the Hawaiian Islands, and in\r\nour Gulf states.\r\n\r\nRice is the chief food of one half the people of the world. Although we\r\nraise large quantities, we produce only about one half of what we use.\r\nIt is a kind of grain which will not thrive on the fertile Western\r\nprairies where corn, oats, and wheat grow. It needs a warm climate and a\r\ngreat deal of water. For this reason the rice fields are found on the\r\nmarshy lands near the coast, and by the banks of rivers, where they can\r\nbe easily flooded. Some rice is raised on the uplands, but not so\r\nsuccessfully as on the lowlands.\r\n\r\nCanals are dug from the streams through the farms, and from these\r\nsmaller ditches branch off so as to reach all parts. They are so\r\narranged that the farmer can turn the water on or off whenever he\r\nwishes. On some of the farms, wells furnish the water to the canals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--A Rice Field.--Observe the Canal.]\r\n\r\nIn the Gulf states the fields are plowed in the winter, and the rice is\r\nsown between the first of April and the middle of May. Sometimes the\r\nseed is sown broadcast, as wheat is, and sometimes it is planted in\r\nregular drills or trenches about twelve inches apart.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese sow the seed in gardens, and when the plants are eight or\r\nten inches high, they are pulled up and transplanted to the fields. The\r\nmen work right in the water, for the fields are flooded at the time.\r\n\r\nIn our country the farmer floods the field as soon as the seeds are\r\nplanted, allowing the water to remain five or six days. When the young\r\nblade of rice is a few inches high, the field is again flooded. After\r\nthe second leaf appears on the stalk, the water is turned on and left\r\nfor twenty or thirty days. After the land dries the crop is hoed. The\r\nfields are irrigated from time to time, until about eight days before\r\nthe harvest, which generally occurs in August.\r\n\r\nWhen full grown, the stalks are from one to six feet in height, with\r\nlong, slender leaves. The kernels grow much as those of wheat and oats\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nOn account of the fields being so wet, rice, in most countries, is cut\r\nby hand. In China and Japan small curved sickles are used, and the\r\ngrain is bound up in very small bundles. In Louisiana and some other\r\nparts of the South, regular harvesters are used. They have very broad\r\nwheels. Why?\r\n\r\nAfter the grain has been bound into bundles, these are set up in double\r\nrows to dry. This is called _shocking_ the rice. The grain is then put\r\nthrough a thrashing machine, to separate it from the straw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Harvesting Rice.]\r\n\r\nRice kernels are covered by a husk. Before the husk is removed the grain\r\nis often called _paddy rice_. Removing the hulls or husks is called\r\n_hulling_. The hulling machine is a long tube into one end of which the\r\nrice is poured. Within the tube are ribs which revolve rapidly. As the\r\nkernels pass between these the hulls are taken off.\r\n\r\nIf you were passing through a Chinese village, you might hear sounds\r\nlike those produced when a man pounds with a mallet on a great piece of\r\ntimber. On searching for the sounds, you would find that they came from\r\nthe rice mill. The mill consists of a portion of a log hollowed out and\r\nplaced upright. In the hollow a quantity of rice is held. A piece of\r\ntimber, fastened to a pivot, extends in a horizontal position with one\r\nend over the mill. To this end another timber is fastened in an upright\r\nposition. A Chinaman gets on to the end of the long timber which is\r\nfarthest from the mill. This raises the end with the upright. He then\r\njumps off and the upright falls, striking upon the rice. In this way the\r\nhulls are worn off.\r\n\r\nAfter hulling, the grain is carefully screened, in order to remove the\r\nhulls, the broken and very small kernels, and the _rice flour_. This\r\nlatter makes good cattle food.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have noticed that rice kernels have a bluish appearance.\r\nThis is not natural, but is the result of polishing. The polishing\r\nremoves much of the best part of the grain, but the rice sells for a\r\nhigher price simply on account of its appearance.\r\n\r\nThe polishing machine is cylindrical or drum-like in shape. Moosehide or\r\nsheepskin is tacked to the cylinder. It is made to revolve rapidly, so\r\nthat the kernels are polished as they pass over the skin. After being\r\npolished the kernels are run through screens and sorted. The rice is\r\nthen put up in barrels or sacks and shipped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW SUGAR IS MADE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Sowing Sugar Seed.]\r\n\r\nThis picture represents one of the beginnings of the great industry of\r\nsugar making. The small objects which you see in the trenches are pieces\r\nof sugar cane. These \"cuttings,\" as they are called, are covered with\r\nsoil. They soon sprout, and from them grow the tall, waving fields of\r\ncane, which resemble cornfields. The canes are taller than cornstalks,\r\nhowever. How high do you think those shown in the picture are?\r\n\r\nIn about ten months after planting the cane is ready to cut. In the\r\nSouthern states this work usually begins about the middle of October.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Cutting Sugar Cane.]\r\n\r\nThe canes are jointed, as cornstalks are, and the spongy substance\r\nbetween the joints is filled with a sweet juice. It is from this juice\r\nor sap that cane sugar is made. I have seen children chew pieces of the\r\ncane, and enjoy it as you do candy; for this use it is sometimes sold in\r\nstores in the South.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Loading Cars with Sugar Cane.]\r\n\r\nAfter the canes are cut they are hauled to the mill or sugarhouse on\r\nwagons. On the large plantations _tram cars_ sometimes run right into\r\nthe fields.\r\n\r\nAt the mill the canes are run between heavy rollers, which squeeze out\r\nthe sap. Sometimes as many as seventy-five pounds of sap are obtained\r\nfrom one hundred pounds of cane. The crushed stalks are used in the mill\r\nfor fuel, and the ashes are returned to the land to fertilize it.\r\n\r\nWhen the juice is first pressed out, it is not at all clear in color. It\r\nis then placed in great vats or kettles and heated. This heating causes\r\nthe water which is in the sap to evaporate, and it also brings some of\r\nthe impurities to the top, where they are skimmed off. When the\r\nevaporating has been finished, there are two products, molasses and\r\nbrown sugar.\r\n\r\nThe sugar must next be refined. For this purpose it is usually sent to\r\ncities outside of the sugar belt. There are great refineries in New\r\nOrleans, San Francisco, St. Louis, Chicago, and other cities.\r\n\r\nWhen the _raw sugar_, as it is called, reaches the refinery, which is\r\ngenerally a tall building, it is taken to the top story and dissolved in\r\nhot water. It then passes through bags which act as _filters_, and\r\nthrough a great cylinder which contains burned bones, known as\r\n_bone-black_. You remember that I told you that the bones of the cattle\r\nwere saved. This is one of the uses to which they are put. When the\r\nliquid comes out of this bone filter it is a perfectly clear sirup,\r\nwhich is then crystallized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--A Sugar Mill.]\r\n\r\nYou know that we buy refined sugar in three forms: granulated sugar,\r\nloaf sugar, and pulverized sugar. When granulated sugar is wanted, the\r\ncrystals are placed in a great drum, which revolves until they are\r\nthoroughly dried in the right form. To make loaf sugar, the crystals are\r\npressed into molds, then dried, and cut into the size desired. In\r\npowdered sugar they are simply ground to a powdered condition.\r\n\r\nThink how much labor is required to produce sugar, and yet you can buy\r\nit for five cents a pound.\r\n\r\nThere are great fields of sugar cane in the Gulf states, in Cuba, in the\r\nHawaiian Islands, in the East Indies, in India, and in other warm, moist\r\nparts of the world. We buy a great deal of sugar from Cuba, and from the\r\nHawaiian Islands. To what city do you think the sugar from the Hawaiian\r\nIslands is sent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEET SUGAR\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the cane fields of the moist, hot countries yield great\r\nquantities of sugar, there are other sources from which this useful\r\nproduct comes. In the year 1747 a German scientist discovered that sugar\r\ncan be made from beets, and now about two thirds of our supply come from\r\nthese plants.\r\n\r\nThe sugar beet is not just like the plant of the same name which we\r\nraise for table use. It is white, and sometimes weighs as much as ten or\r\nfifteen pounds. Beets do not need so much water nor so much heat as\r\nsugar cane, so they can be raised in Germany, France, Austria, Russia,\r\nand other countries, as well as in California, Utah, and Nebraska, in\r\nour own land.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of California there are fields of beets stretching for\r\nmiles. The seeds are planted in rows, which, after the plants have come\r\nup, are thinned. In four or five months from the time the seeds are\r\nplanted, the beets are ready to harvest.\r\n\r\nOn most of the large _ranches_ the beets are dug by machinery. Men then\r\nmove back and forth in the fields, cutting off the leaves and a little\r\nof the upper part of the beet, for this contains too much mineral matter\r\nto be of value in making sugar. The workmen use large knives, and they\r\nwalk on their knees.\r\n\r\nThe beets are now taken to the factory in wagons, or, if it is far away,\r\nthey are sent on trains. When the loads of beets reach the factory, they\r\nare weighed. The teamsters then drive up an inclined plane to a plank\r\nroadway. There are generally several of these. On each side of the road\r\nor platform are deep V-shaped trenches with wooden sides, in which\r\nstreams of water run. When the wagon has reached the right spot, the\r\nplatform upon which it rests is raised in a slanting position, and the\r\nbeets fall into the trench.\r\n\r\nA basket full of beets is taken from each load and tested, to see how\r\nmuch sugar they contain, for this determines the price to be paid.\r\n\r\nThe stream of water in the trench carries the beets along, just as they\r\nwould be carried in a brook. This, you see, is a quick and easy way of\r\nwashing them.\r\n\r\nThe streams of water carry the beets into the factory, where they are\r\ncut up into strips by machinery. The juice is then washed out in vats\r\ncontaining warm water, and is boiled down in great tanks. The raw sugar\r\nis refined much as the cane sugar is. After the sugar has been dried, it\r\nis run through spouts into sacks held open to catch it as it comes out.\r\nOne hundred pounds are put into each sack. One workman sews the sacks up\r\nand another wheels them to the wareroom. Train loads are carried away to\r\nbe distributed in the parts of our country that do not produce sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAPLE SUGAR\r\n\r\n\r\nYou would enjoy helping to make some maple sugar, I am sure, so let us\r\nmake a trip to the woods of Vermont or New York, where maple sugar is\r\nmade from the sap of the sugar-maple tree.\r\n\r\nYou will need your cap and mittens, as the sugar season is the early\r\nspring, when there is yet snow on the ground. Besides, some of the work\r\nis done at night, and you will not wish to miss that.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the \"sugar bush\" bores holes into the trees a short\r\ndistance from the ground, into which he slips small spouts, called\r\n\"spiles.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Tapping a Tree.]\r\n\r\nThis is called _tapping_ the trees. Underneath the spout a pail is\r\nplaced. During the day the sap trickles out and runs into the pail.\r\nDuring the colder hours of the night the sap flows slowly, if at all.\r\nSometimes it is so cold that little sap runs for two or three days at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Oxen hauling Sap.]\r\n\r\nThe sap is collected in barrels and drawn on sleds to the camp or place\r\nwhere it is to be boiled down. This is done in great pans called\r\n_evaporators_, which may be five or six feet wide, and fifteen feet\r\nlong. They are divided into sections, and these are connected by means\r\nof little openings.\r\n\r\nThe sap flows into one end of the evaporator and follows a zigzag path\r\nthrough the different sections. By flowing slowly over so large a\r\nsurface, evaporation goes on rapidly and the sap is changed to sirup by\r\nthe time it has finished its journey.\r\n\r\nThe sirup is put up in cans, or boiled down into sugar, which is molded\r\ninto small cakes, and brings a high price.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Sap-yoke and Pails for gathering Sap.]\r\n\r\n\"Sugaring off,\" as the boiling down of the sap is called, is quite an\r\nevent. Often a number of people will be invited to go to the sugarhouse\r\nand take part in the operation.\r\n\r\nBefore the modern evaporator came into use \"sugaring off\" always\r\noccurred at night. This was necessary, because during the day the sap\r\nbuckets had to be attended to. The young people would sing songs, tell\r\nstories, and eat sugar.\r\n\r\nSome of the \"sugar bushes\" contain but a few trees and some contain one\r\nor two thousand or even more. A tree will yield from one to six pounds\r\nof sugar during a season.\r\n\r\nOur country produces great quantities of sugar every year, but we use so\r\nmuch that we have to buy much more than we manufacture at home. It was\r\nnot always in such common use, however, because people in olden times\r\ndid not understand how to make it cheaply.\r\n\r\nLong, long ago sugar was used only as a medicine. Don't you wish that\r\nall medicine to-day was as good as sugar? About seven hundred years ago\r\nan Italian nobleman died and left to his relatives, among other things,\r\n_six pounds of sugar_. His will caused considerable comment among the\r\npeople, who said that no one family should be allowed to have so much\r\nsugar in its possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE SALT COMES FROM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Arab, journeying over the yellow sands, riding upon the back of his\r\nfaithful \"ship of the desert,\" often looks longingly for some sign of\r\nwater to cool his parched lips. The sailor may ride upon the beautiful\r\nblue waters of the ocean in his white-winged ship; but although there is\r\nnothing but water to greet his eyes, he cannot drink it, for it is\r\nbitter to the taste.\r\n\r\nIf you were to place a quantity of ocean water over a fire and evaporate\r\nit, there would remain a white substance. This is common salt. You see\r\nthat it is as necessary to provide fresh water when one wishes to cross\r\nthe ocean, as it is if one is going to cross the desert.\r\n\r\nMost streams and lakes contain _fresh_ water, so you will wonder why the\r\nwaters of the ocean are briny. The rocks and soil of the earth contain\r\nsalt, and the streams wash it from the land. Each one carries so little\r\nthat we do not notice it, but they have worked so steadily and so long,\r\nthat they have carried a great amount to the sea. None of it can escape,\r\nso the ocean gets more and more briny.\r\n\r\nNo healthy person would ever think of eating salt alone as a food, and\r\nyet our food would taste very unsatisfactory without it. Farmers supply\r\ntheir cattle and horses with salt, and wild animals search for it in the\r\nforests, and lick it from the soil with their tongues.\r\n\r\nSalt is so important to us that I want to tell you about some of the\r\nways in which men obtain it.\r\n\r\nSometimes sea water is placed in great vats and evaporated. This leaves\r\nthe salt, which is then refined. You know that the sun's heat causes the\r\nwaters of a shallow pond to evaporate during warm weather. Shallow\r\nbasins are often scooped out along the coast, and the waters which fill\r\nthem are then shut off from the larger body. In time the water\r\nevaporates, and the salt, which has formed in thin layers, is\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nI said that most lakes are fresh-water bodies. There are some, however,\r\nthat are _very_ salty. Great Salt Lake is one of these. Streams flow\r\ninto it, but none flows out. If you were to bathe in the waters of this\r\nlake, you would find that your body would not sink.\r\n\r\nI have seen great piles of glistening salt along the shore of Great Salt\r\nLake which had been obtained by evaporation. A railroad runs beside the\r\nlake, and the salt is loaded upon the cars to be hauled away. When the\r\npeople first settled in Utah, they used to drive to the lake in wagons\r\nto get a supply of salt.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ocean and a few lakes contain immense quantities of this\r\nuseful article, we get most of our supply from other sources.\r\n\r\nIn the western part of New York State, at some distance below the\r\nsurface of the earth, there is a thick layer of salt. Wells are drilled\r\ndown to this; water is pumped into them, and then pumped out again as\r\nbrine. This brine is evaporated in large pans made of iron, two quarts\r\nof brine yielding about a pound of salt.\r\n\r\nIn China salt has been obtained in this way for hundreds and even\r\nthousands of years. Though they had little machinery to work with in\r\nthose days, yet by patient, steady effort, they drilled wells two\r\nthousand and even three thousand feet in depth. From twenty-five to\r\nforty years were required to drill some of these wells. Those who\r\ncommenced them knew that they were not likely to enjoy the fruits of\r\ntheir labor and that others must get the benefit of what they did. What\r\ndoes this show about these people? What benefits are you receiving from\r\nwhat others have done?\r\n\r\nSalt is also mined as coal and iron are. This is called _rock salt_. It\r\nis obtained in Germany, Poland, Austria, India, the United States, and\r\nin many other countries.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting salt fields of the world is in the\r\nsoutheastern part of California. It is on the Colorado Desert, near the\r\nColorado River. This was once a part of the ocean floor and the rocks\r\ncontain much salt. Water seeping through the earth dissolves the salt\r\nand brings it to the surface at this place. What happens to the water?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Harvesting Salt, Salton, California. Is there\r\nany Water in this Field?]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Loading Cars with Salt. Salton, California.]\r\n\r\nThis salt field covers an area of about one thousand acres, to a depth\r\nof from one to eight inches. You can see by the picture that it looks\r\nmore like a field of snow and ice than one of salt. The bright sunlight\r\nis reflected from its surface with such power that it hurts one's eyes.\r\n\r\nA great plow drawn by a steam engine moves over this dazzling field,\r\nand throws the salt up in furrows. It is then piled up, loaded on to\r\ncars, and taken to sheds, where it is purified. Indians and Japanese do\r\nmost of the work.\r\n\r\nIn order to purify the brines they are boiled in iron pans and treated\r\nin various ways to make them fit for table use. When evaporation is\r\nrapid, the salt crystals are quite small, but slower evaporation\r\nproduces larger ones. Rock salt is dissolved in water and then\r\nevaporated. To get the finest of salt, the crystals must be ground. When\r\nsalt is to be used for other purposes than to season food, not so much\r\npains are taken. Name other uses of salt.\r\n\r\nIn olden times, when salt was not so easily obtained as it is to-day, it\r\nwas regarded in some countries as a luxury. This seems strange, does it\r\nnot? At one time the Chinese made it into little cakes, stamped the\r\nimage of the emperor upon it, and used it as money. In Arabia those who\r\ntogether ate food which had been salted, believed that this established\r\na special bond of friendship between them. This led to the old saying,\r\n\"There is salt between us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACARONI AND VERMICELLI\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever wondered as you have looked at the hollow sticks of\r\nmacaroni in the stores or as you have eaten them at the table, how they\r\nwere made in that way, and what they were made of?\r\n\r\nIn Italy macaroni is a very important article of food, and its use is\r\nrapidly increasing in our own country. For a long time it was not made\r\noutside of Italy, where the city of Genoa was the center of the\r\nindustry. Locate this city. Do you know what great man was born there?\r\nNow macaroni and vermicelli are made in other countries. There are a few\r\nfactories in the United States, but most of what we use still comes from\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nIn making these foods only the best hard wheat is used.\r\n\r\nAfter grinding the wheat, the bran is taken out and the flour is placed\r\nin a large wooden tub. Water is added, and the two are mixed by hand\r\nfor a few minutes. In this tub a marble wheel about five feet in\r\ndiameter and eighteen inches in thickness is fastened in an upright\r\nposition. This wheel weighs about a ton.\r\n\r\nAfter the flour and water have been mixed, the wheel is set in motion by\r\nmachinery, and it slowly circles around in the tub, pressing the dough\r\nunder it.\r\n\r\nA man keeps walking in front of the wheel, moving the dough from the\r\nedges of the tub and placing it directly in the path of it. This work of\r\npressing the flour into a paste continues for a little more than half an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThe wheel is then stopped and the paste, which is quite stiff, is cut\r\ninto cakes about a foot square and from one to three inches in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nThese are put into an iron cylinder heated by steam. In the bottom of\r\nthe cylinder is a copper plate filled with holes having the centers\r\nfilled. A cover fitted to a great screw which turns by machinery is\r\nplaced on top. This slowly, but steadily, presses the paste downward.\r\nIt is thus forced through these openings, and of course comes out in the\r\nform of round, hollow pipes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Drying Macaroni in Italy.]\r\n\r\nAs these pipes issue from the cylinder, they are straightened out on a\r\nwooden tray or platform, and with a large, sharp knife cut into lengths\r\nof about three feet. They are then taken to a drying room and spread on\r\nwire frames covered with oiled paper. Here they are left for about five\r\ndays, after which they are placed in boxes and are ready to ship.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between macaroni and vermicelli is that the pipes\r\nof vermicelli are very small and are not hollow.\r\n\r\nWhen vermicelli is wanted, two plates are placed on the bottom of the\r\npress. The under one is of iron and contains holes about one inch in\r\ndiameter. The upper one is of copper and contains _groups_ of very small\r\nopenings. There are sometimes eighty of these openings in a group. When\r\nthe plates are screwed together, the groups of small holes are directly\r\nabove the larger openings.\r\n\r\nAs the paste is pressed, it passes through the little holes and then\r\nissues from the larger ones; this keeps each little group of pipes\r\nsomewhat apart from the others.\r\n\r\nSaffron is added to the paste to color it, and the great golden mass is\r\nquite a pretty sight as it steadily lengthens.\r\n\r\nThe workman cuts off six or seven feet of it at a time; and holding it\r\nabove his head with one hand, he shakes it out with the other, as one\r\nmight shake the folds of a piece of silk. The pipes tangle up very\r\nlittle. They are cut into lengths of about eighteen inches.\r\n\r\nIt is then taken to the drying room and spread out on the trays just as\r\nthe macaroni is. A handful of the vermicelli is taken at a time, and by\r\na peculiar twist of the arm it is placed on the paper in a form\r\nsomething like that of the letter _n_. After drying for five days it is\r\npacked and shipped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON A COFFEE PLANTATION\r\n\r\n\r\nJuan and Lupe live in a beautiful valley where palm and banana trees\r\nwave their broad leaves in the breeze. It is never cold there, so that\r\nmany kinds of plants and flowers grow out of doors which we do not see\r\nin our country except in greenhouses. On clear days they can see lofty\r\nmountains far to the westward, which sometimes wear caps of white.\r\n\r\nJuan is fourteen years old and Lupe is twelve. Their skin is much darker\r\nthan yours, and they have bright black eyes and black hair. Their father\r\nowns a great coffee plantation in Brazil, not far from the city of Rio\r\nJaneiro.\r\n\r\nThere are many men, women, and children employed on the plantation, and\r\nJuan and Lupe enjoy roaming about from place to place and watching them\r\nat their work.\r\n\r\nIn the nursery they see men planting the coffee seeds in the rich soil.\r\nThere are some plants that have just come up, and some that are ready\r\nto transplant. They are set out in rows, six or eight feet apart each\r\nway, and sometimes more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--A Coffee Nursery.]\r\n\r\nThe trees would grow much taller than those you see in the picture, if\r\nthey were not kept pruned. Do you know why they are prevented from\r\ngrowing tall? Whenever you look at a coffee plantation, you see the dark\r\ngreen foliage of the tree, which is an evergreen. Lupe is very fond of\r\nthe blossoms. They are clear white and very fragrant.\r\n\r\nA tree will yield a small amount the second year after planting, but it\r\nwill not produce a full crop for five or more years. Two pounds is a\r\ngood average crop for a tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Picking Coffee.]\r\n\r\nThe children like to watch the pickers as they go from tree to tree.\r\nMany of them are about their own age. Some carry a sack slung over the\r\nshoulders, and others carry baskets or pails. The _berries_ must be\r\npicked by hand, for they do not all ripen at once. They are dark\r\nscarlet in color and look a little like cranberries. A good picker\r\ngathers about three bushels in a day. The pickers are given a check\r\nevery time they fill a basket. Sometimes Juan tends to this work, and he\r\nenjoys it very much. At the end of each week the pickers are paid\r\naccording to the number of checks they have.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Coffee Berries.]\r\n\r\nWithin the berry are two kernels or seeds, with their flat sides\r\ntogether. These are called \"coffee beans.\" It is these beans from which\r\nthe drink is made.\r\n\r\nThe picking is but a small part of the work of preparing coffee for the\r\nmarket. The first operation is removing the pulp. This used to be done\r\nby tramping on the berries, but now it is done in a better way.\r\n\r\nThe berries are thrown into a large tank filled with water, which\r\ncarries them through a pipe to the pulping machine. This machine removes\r\nthe pulp and separates the beans.\r\n\r\nNext the beans are carried to a second tank, where they remain for about\r\ntwenty-four hours, to wash off a sticky substance which covers the shell\r\nof the bean.\r\n\r\nIf you have ever put beans or peas into a basin of water, you have\r\nnoticed that nearly all of them sink, while a few float. These latter\r\nare the poor ones. This is the way in which the good and bad coffee\r\nbeans are separated. A pipe carries off the seeds that float on the\r\nsurface of the water.\r\n\r\nThe beans are dried on cement floors upon which they are spread. This\r\ndrying takes a long time. Before sunset each day the coffee must be\r\ncarried under shelter, for the dew injures it. While they are drying,\r\nthe workmen stir them. Sometimes artificial heat is used, but this is\r\nexpensive. Juan's father has a watchman whose duty it is to guard the\r\ncoffee at night, for it is very valuable.\r\n\r\nEach bean is covered by a strong shell, or hull, which has to be\r\nremoved. The soaking has loosened this, and so it comes off easier than\r\nit otherwise would. Juan and Lupe often watch the wheels of the huller\r\nas they turn, moved by patient oxen.\r\n\r\nThere are two wheels set upright over a circular box, into which the\r\ncoffee is put. As it passes between the wheels and the bottom of the\r\nbox, the hulls are removed. Underneath the hull is a thin skin, which is\r\nalso taken off.\r\n\r\nIn some countries people want the coffee dyed or colored. A bluish color\r\nis given to it by coating the wheels of the hulling machine with lead.\r\n\r\nThe hulls are separated from the beans in a winnowing machine, and the\r\ncoffee is then sorted. Often this is done by hand. The beans are spread\r\nout on a table, and girls and boys, and sometimes grown persons, sort\r\nit into several grades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Sorting and sacking Coffee.]\r\n\r\nJuan's father has this work done by machinery. The coffee is put into a\r\ncylinder, in the bottom of which there are holes of different sizes by\r\nwhich it is graded.\r\n\r\nThe last process is to sack the coffee and send it by railroad to Rio\r\nJaneiro. Of course it is neither roasted nor ground until it reaches its\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nWe do not produce coffee in our country, but we are the greatest coffee\r\ndrinkers in the world. A large part of our supply comes from Brazil.\r\nTrace the course of the ship from Rio Janeiro to New York. Juan has\r\noften done this, and his father has promised to take him with him\r\nsometime, when he goes with a cargo of coffee.\r\n\r\nYou naturally think that coffee of different names must come from\r\ndifferent countries, or at least from different trees. This is not\r\nalways the case. Several brands may come from the same tree. The name\r\ndepends partly upon the size and the general appearance of the beans.\r\n\r\nCoffee is a native of the far East, but it has gradually been\r\ntransplanted to other countries, until it is now very extensively used.\r\nBrazil, Central America, Mexico, the West Indies, the Hawaiian Islands,\r\nJava, Ceylon, and Arabia are coffee-raising countries.\r\n\r\nIn 1551 coffee found its way to the city of Constantinople; in 1652 it\r\nhad reached London; and in 1720 it was planted in the West Indies. You\r\nsee it worked its way westward rather slowly.\r\n\r\nSeveral hundred years ago, coffee was very expensive, so that only the\r\nrich could afford to use it. Instead of drinking it at home, people went\r\nto \"coffeehouses,\" where it was served. To these \"coffeehouses\" men\r\nbrought whatever news they had heard and told it to one another. In this\r\nway these places served about the same purpose that newspapers do now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEA GARDENS OF CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the teapot you will find some leaves. Spread one of\r\nthem out carefully. You can see that it was once long and slender, a\r\nlittle like willow leaves. It may have grown in some garden in far-away\r\nChina, for we get a great deal of tea from that country.\r\n\r\nI have told you how close together the people live on the fertile plains\r\nof eastern China. There is so little room that many live on boats on the\r\nrivers and in the harbors. On this account their farms are not so large\r\nas ours.\r\n\r\nThe tea trees in the gardens are about five or six feet high. If they\r\nwere allowed to, they would reach a height of twenty-five feet; but they\r\nare kept trimmed for the same reasons that the coffee trees are pruned.\r\n\r\nThe trees are raised from seeds, and are generally planted on land which\r\nslopes toward the south. What advantage is this?\r\n\r\nIn about three years after planting, the first crop of leaves can be\r\ngathered. In China they are usually gathered four times each year, and\r\nthe trees continue to yield for twenty-five or thirty years.\r\n\r\nWhen the leaves are picked, they are full of sap or juice, and so have\r\nto be dried. The drying is usually done on trays made of bamboo. While\r\nthey are drying, they are rubbed and rolled between the palms of the\r\nhands, so that they may dry more quickly and evenly.\r\n\r\nNext the leaves are placed, a few at a time, in iron pans over a\r\ncharcoal fire. They are left in these but a short time, for they are\r\nhot. This process is called \"firing.\" Sometimes the leaves are \"fired\"\r\nbut once, and sometimes twice.\r\n\r\nThe tea is then spread out, and broken bits of stems are removed. Some\r\nof the tea growers place the tea in baskets which are suspended over\r\nslow fires, for drying.\r\n\r\nIf you were to look into some of the _tea-hongs_ or houses where tea is\r\ncured and packed, you would find the tea dried in a very curious\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Picking Tea. \"Pinehurst,\" South Carolina.]\r\n\r\nIn one of the rooms you would see several Chinamen rolling and tossing\r\nballs about with their bare feet. The balls are about the size of\r\nfootballs and are partly filled with tea. Although it looks like play,\r\nit is hard work. As the balls are tossed about, the tea leaves are given\r\ntheir rounded or twisted appearance. From time to time the workers stop\r\nand tie the bags up more closely at the neck. This method is used in\r\nmaking _gunpowder tea_.\r\n\r\nBlack and green teas are not different varieties, but are produced by\r\ndifferent methods of handling.\r\n\r\nIn the great tea-hongs there are professional _tasters_,--that is, men\r\nwho do nothing but sip tea from small cups, so as to grade it and fix\r\nits value. This is considered a very particular line of work and\r\nrequires an educated taste.\r\n\r\nThe ocean atmosphere has a bad effect on tea, so that the very finest\r\ngrades are seldom sent across the sea. When tea is to be shipped by\r\nwater, it is placed in boxes lined with a sort of sheet lead. This\r\nprotects the tea greatly. Most of the tea sent to the United States\r\nlands at San Francisco. Why? How does it get to other parts of our\r\ncountry?\r\n\r\nGreat quantities of tea are pressed into the form of bricks and sent\r\nover mountains and across deserts into Russia.\r\n\r\nThis is called \"brick tea.\" The Russians are great tea drinkers, and\r\nwhenever any one calls in Russia, tea is served. They call their teapot\r\na _samovar_.\r\n\r\nBetter tea is obtained from Ceylon and India than from China. In these\r\ncountries Europeans have charge of most of the tea farms, and they have\r\ncarefully studied the cultivation and handling of tea.\r\n\r\nThere is a little tea raised in our own country in the state of South\r\nCarolina. It is very fine in quality and people are willing to pay a\r\nhigh price for it. Some of it has been sold for five dollars a pound.\r\n\r\nWhen tea was first brought into Europe, it was regarded as a great\r\nluxury, just as coffee was. People paid as much as fifty dollars a pound\r\nfor it. It is said that some of the tea raised to-day for the royal\r\nfamily of China, is worth a hundred dollars a pound.\r\n\r\nMany people in this country do not enjoy a cup of tea unless they have\r\nmilk and sugar in it. The Chinese do not use either in their tea. In\r\nRussia it is quite common to draw the tea through a lump of sugar held\r\nbetween the teeth.\r\n\r\nYou know that tea parties are very common. The most celebrated tea party\r\never held was called the \"Boston Tea Party.\" See what you can find out\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CUP OF COCOA\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth day of June, in the year 1771, this notice appeared in\r\nthe _Essex Gazette_ of Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\n                          \"AMOS TRASK,\r\n\r\n     At his House a little below the Bell-Tavern in\r\n\r\n                            DANVERS,\r\n\r\n                  Makes and sells Chocolate,\r\n\r\n     which he will warrant to be good, and takes Cocoa to grind. Those\r\n     who may please to favor him with their Custom may depend upon being\r\n     well served, and at a very cheap Rate.\"\r\n\r\nThis seems to have been the first notice of the manufacture and sale of\r\ncocoa and chocolate in our country. What is peculiar about the notice?\r\n\r\nIn those days the raw product was brought to Massachusetts by the\r\nGloucester fishermen. They obtained it in the West Indies in exchange\r\nfor fish and other things which they took there.\r\n\r\nWhen the Spanish soldier, Cortez, conquered Mexico in 1519, he found\r\nthat the people of that country were very fond of a drink which they\r\ncalled \"chocolatl.\" It was served to their ruler, Montezuma, in a cup of\r\ngold. When the Spaniards went home, they of course introduced the drink\r\ninto their own country. For a long time it was very expensive and was\r\nnot commonly used outside of Spain, for the Spaniards kept the secret of\r\nits preparation.\r\n\r\nCocoa and chocolate are products of the seeds of a tree called the cacao\r\ntree. It is a tropical tree and grows in both the Old and the New World.\r\n\r\nAlthough the cacao tree grows wild, it is also cultivated in orchards\r\nmuch like fruit orchards which you have seen. The trees are seldom more\r\nthan twenty feet high, but they are rather inclined to spread out. They\r\nrequire some shade, and so other trees are often planted between the\r\nrows to shade them. The trees begin to bear when five or six years old,\r\nand continue to yield for forty years. There are generally two chief\r\nharvests each year, but the fruit is ripening all of the time.\r\n\r\nThe blossoms, which grow in clusters, are small and pink or yellow in\r\ncolor. They grow directly from the branches or the trunk of the tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Cocoa Pods and Leaves.\r\n\r\n(Permission of WALTER BAKER & CO., Ltd.)]\r\n\r\nIn about four months after the tree has blossomed, you will find dark\r\nyellow or brown pods hanging from it. These look a little like ripe\r\ncucumbers, but they are more pointed at one end and are grooved or\r\nfluted. These pods are from six inches to a foot or more in length, with\r\na rather thick, tough rind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Native Cocoa Pickers. Ceylon. (Permission of\r\nWALTER BAKER & CO., Ltd.)]\r\n\r\nHow do you think the pods are gathered? They are cut off by men carrying\r\nlong poles, sometimes of bamboo, to the ends of which knives are\r\nfastened. Only the ripe pods are cut off and collected in a heap under\r\nthe tree. They are left in these heaps for about twenty-four hours,\r\nwhen they are cut open and the seeds are gathered in baskets.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are called \"beans.\" There are five rows of them, about the\r\nsize of almonds, within the pink pulp of the fruit. When fresh they are\r\nwhite, but when dried they are brown. If you taste one, you will find it\r\nbitter.\r\n\r\nYou have often seen on packages of chocolate, as well as on the cans of\r\nbreakfast cocoa, the picture of a young woman carrying some chocolate\r\nupon a tray. It is the picture of a beautiful girl who once served\r\nchocolate in the old city of Vienna. Her name was Anette Baldauff, and\r\nshe married a rich count and \"lived happily ever after.\" It is said that\r\na painting of her hangs upon the walls of the great art gallery in\r\nDresden. Point out the cities I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are carried from the orchard to the sheds, where they are\r\nprepared for market. Here they go through a process of fermentation or\r\n\"sweating.\" For this purpose they are placed in a covered box, or they\r\nmay even be covered with earth. This is called \"claying.\" Now the seeds\r\nmust be dried. They are spread out on platforms, raised a little above\r\nthe ground, so that the air can circulate underneath. You notice that\r\nthe roofs do not cover them just now, for their only purpose is to keep\r\noff the dew and the rain. They are fastened to frames which have wheels\r\nunder them. During the day they are not used, but at night they are\r\nrolled over the cocoa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Drying Cocoa Seed. Ceylon.\r\n\r\n(Permission of WALTER BAKER & CO., Ltd.)]\r\n\r\nThe cocoa is stirred by workmen using long shovels or rakes, so that it\r\nmay dry quickly and evenly. Once a day the beans are shoveled into heaps\r\nand the workmen tread upon them with their bare feet, as you see. This\r\nis called \"dancing the cocoa.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the seeds have dried for about two weeks they are nearly the color\r\nof red bricks. They are put up for shipment in canvas sacks holding one\r\nhundred and fifty pounds each. The name of the plantation is usually\r\nstamped upon the outside. Guayaquil exports more cocoa than any other\r\ncity. Find it. A great deal comes from the island of Trinidad, and from\r\nthe northern part of South America.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"beans\" have reached their destination, they must be cleaned,\r\nto rid them of dust and dirt collected on the way. They are then placed\r\nin a great revolving cylinder and roasted. You remember that when coffee\r\nis roasted it brings out a pleasant odor called its _aroma_. The same is\r\ntrue of cocoa. The roasting also helps to loosen a shell which surrounds\r\nthe seed. The shell is next removed and the \"beans\" are then crushed.\r\n\r\nThe Mexicans used to crush the seeds on a large stone, hollowed out on\r\ntop. This they called a \"matate.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Grinding Cocoa.\r\n\r\n(Permission of WALTER BAKER & CO., Ltd.)]\r\n\r\nThe crushing is now done by machinery. The broken bits of the cocoa are\r\ncalled \"cocoa nibs.\" When the cocoa is ground to a powder, it is put\r\ninto strong bags and pressed. This pressure removes a part of an oily\r\nsubstance known as \"cocoa butter.\" Remember, then, that cocoa is the\r\nmeal or flour made from the crushed seeds from which some of the oil has\r\nbeen removed. Chocolate differs from cocoa in that none of this oil is\r\nremoved in making it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Moulding Cocoa.\r\n\r\n(Permission of WALTER BAKER & CO., Ltd.)]\r\n\r\nYou have often seen the words \"sweet chocolate\" on the labels. This is\r\nmade by adding a quantity of pulverized sugar to the \"plain\" or \"bitter\"\r\nchocolate. Sometimes vanilla beans are added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Cooling Cocoa.\r\n\r\n(Permission of WALTER BAKER & CO., Ltd.)]\r\n\r\nThe pasty mass known as chocolate must be molded. When the proper amount\r\nhas been placed in each of several metal molds which rest on a table,\r\nthey are made to rock or shake, and this causes the chocolate to assume\r\nthe right shape. The molds are then taken to the cooling room, where\r\nthey are placed on frames, one above another, in long rows. Girls and\r\nwomen wrap the cakes of chocolate in the wrappers specially prepared for\r\nthem, after which they are packed in boxes ready for shipment.\r\n\r\nAt Dorchester, Massachusetts, on the Neponset River, is situated the\r\nlargest establishment for the manufacture of cocoa and chocolate in\r\nAmerica. It is interesting to know that on the very spot where these\r\ngreat mills now stand, was built, in 1765, the first one of the kind in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CRANBERRY BOG\r\n\r\n\r\n                WAREHAM, MASSACHUSETTS, Dec. 10, 1901.\r\n\r\nDEAR FRANK: How surprised you will be to learn that I am now a country\r\nboy. We left Boston early last spring, and came out here to go into the\r\nbusiness of cranberry raising. It seemed very strange at first to travel\r\nalong country roads, or through woods and fields, instead of upon the\r\ncement walks of our city streets, but we all think the country\r\ndelightful.\r\n\r\nA cranberry farm is a marsh or a bog, so you will see that the vines\r\nneed a great deal of water. There are both wild and cultivated bogs.\r\nThose that are cultivated are provided with a system of ditches, so that\r\nthey can be flooded from time to time. It is a good deal like irrigation\r\nin Southern California, I suppose. We flood the bogs to prevent the\r\nberries from freezing, as well as to furnish the vines with water. I\r\nwill tell you more about that by and by.\r\n\r\nFather wanted a larger bog than the one he first bought, so, soon after\r\nwe came, he got another small piece of marsh land which joins it on the\r\nwest, and started vines on it.\r\n\r\nYou know that willows, rosebushes, grapevines, and many other plants\r\nwill grow from _cuttings_. It is the same with cranberry vines. The\r\nlower end of each cutting is pressed into the soil, and it soon begins\r\nto grow. They are set in rows about fourteen inches apart. One of our\r\nneighbors, who was starting a bog at the same time, cut the vines into\r\npieces an inch or two long, and scattered them over the ground. He then\r\nharrowed them in. The vines multiply just as strawberry plants do, by\r\nputting out _runners_.\r\n\r\nThey tell us that our new bog will produce a crop in three years. Do you\r\nhave to wait that long for a crop of oranges?\r\n\r\nBy the middle of June our bog was in full blossom. The flowers are quite\r\nsmall and their color is a little like that of the flesh. I read an\r\ninteresting thing about them the other day. It seems that the berries\r\nused to be called \"craneberries,\" because people thought that the\r\nblossoms, just before they opened fully, \"resembled the neck, head, and\r\nbill of a crane.\" By dropping the _e_, we got the present name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--A Cranberry Bog. Showing the Young Vines.]\r\n\r\nDuring our harvest time, which lasted from the middle of September to\r\nthe last of October, we were very busy. We did not commence to go to\r\nschool until the berries were picked. You see, frost may occur and spoil\r\nthe crop, so that everybody works as fast as possible until the harvest\r\nis over. Father had about twenty pickers some of the time, besides our\r\nown family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Cranberry Pickers at Work. Notice how the Bog\r\nis divided into Rows by Means of Cords.]\r\n\r\nWhen we were ready to begin picking, father took some twine and\r\nstretched it back and forth across the bog, fastening it to small\r\nstakes. This divided the field into rows. Each picker was given a row,\r\nand he was not allowed to change until it was finished.\r\n\r\nAt first it seemed great fun to get down on the ground and strip off the\r\nbright berries, but when one does this day after day it gets pretty\r\ntiresome. It must be easy to pick oranges, because you can stand up\r\nwhile you work.\r\n\r\nFather paid the pickers twelve cents a pail. It takes about three\r\npailfuls to make a bushel. I averaged about one dollar and a half each\r\nday. I bought a suit of clothes and all of my books for the year, and\r\nhave considerable money left. Some of the pickers who were quite small\r\ndid not earn very much. Do you recognize Jennie? She worked a part of\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nTwice during the picking season there was a sharp frost, but we saved\r\nthe crop.\r\n\r\nThe government sends out a Weather Map every day. Our teacher gets one,\r\nand there is one tacked up in the post office every morning. These maps\r\ntell what kind of weather to expect, and father watches them closely.\r\nWhen he saw that frost was likely to occur, he and the men opened the\r\ngates which hold back the water, in order to flood the part of the bog\r\nwhere we had not picked. The vines were buried nearly two feet beneath\r\nthe surface of the water. Father says the water cools so slowly that its\r\ntemperature is much above that of the surface of the ground or the air\r\nnear it, so the berries do not get frost-bitten. Soon after sunrise the\r\nwater was drawn off, and the next day the bog was dry enough for the\r\npickers to work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--A Young Worker. Notice how the Berries are\r\npicked.]\r\n\r\nI wonder if the Weather Bureau is of any use to farmers in California. I\r\nknow that the sailors watch for the flags which tell when storms are\r\ncoming, that they may not go to sea if a violent storm is expected.\r\nFather says very many lives and much property are saved every year in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--Winnowing and Barreling Cranberries.]\r\n\r\nI have not told you what we do with the cranberries after they are\r\npicked. Of course we cannot help gathering some leaves and twigs with\r\nthe berries, and these must be taken out. For this purpose the berries\r\nare put into a winnowing machine. I will send you a picture of one. As\r\nthe man turns the crank, wooden fans within turn rapidly, blowing out\r\nthe leaves, twigs, and dirt. The berries drop through a screen and run\r\nout of a spout into a barrel, as you see. We then put them into crates\r\nor barrels for sale. Father tells me that cranberries are shipped from\r\nour country to Europe, because those raised here are much better than\r\nthe European berries.\r\n\r\nThere are great quantities of cranberries raised in this part of\r\nMassachusetts. I have been reading lately that they are produced in New\r\nJersey, on Long Island, in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Canada, and\r\nsome other sections. From what I have read, I guess they are not raised\r\nin Southern California. Wouldn't it seem strange if you were to eat\r\nberries raised on our bog, three thousand miles away?\r\n\r\nNow I want you to tell me about the orange groves of Southern\r\nCalifornia, for none of us have ever seen an orange growing.\r\n\r\nI wish you all a very \"Merry Christmas\" and a \"Happy New Year.\"\r\n\r\n                                      Your loving friend,\r\n\r\n                                                        WILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COCOANUT ISLANDS OF THE PACIFIC\r\n\r\n\r\nImagine yourself on a great ocean steamship, gliding over the blue water\r\nof the Pacific Ocean toward the Samoan Islands. Among the first things\r\nthat you will see as you near the shores of these islands will be tall,\r\nslender, graceful trees, rising without a branch to a height of thirty\r\nto eighty feet. At the top is a sort of crown, composed of long,\r\ndrooping leaves. These beautiful trees lean out over the water and toss\r\ntheir leaves in the strong and steady breeze from the ocean. They seem\r\nto nod a friendly greeting to you as you approach, and to wave a loving\r\nfarewell to you as you sail away. These trees are the cocoanut palms.\r\nThey grow on all of the tropical islands of the Pacific Ocean, in the\r\nWest Indies, and along the shores of most warm countries, but never far\r\nfrom the sea.\r\n\r\nWhen the cocoanut falls into the water, it is rocked and tossed by the\r\nwaves and drifted about by the currents, but it is safe within its\r\nshell, for the salt water cannot penetrate this. When it finally comes\r\nto rest upon some strange shore, it is ready to give to the world\r\nanother cocoanut palm, if the climate is like that from which it sailed.\r\nIn this way nature has helped the trees to become widely distributed.\r\n\r\nThere are cocoanut plantations as well as wild groves of the trees. When\r\na plantation is to be established, the planter selects the ripest nuts\r\nand dries them for several weeks. They are then planted, and by and by a\r\nlittle palm springs from the small end of the nut and the roots from the\r\nlarge end. When the young trees are from six months to two years old,\r\nthey are transplanted in rows thirty or forty feet apart. They begin to\r\nbear nuts in about five years, but they do not yield a full crop for\r\nfifteen or twenty years. Do you think that a poor man could afford to go\r\ninto the business of cocoanut raising?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--A Cocoanut Grove.]\r\n\r\nAs you see in the picture, cocoanuts grow in clusters. You notice\r\nalso that they grow close to the stem instead of at the ends of the\r\nbranches. They do not all ripen at once, but nuts may be picked at\r\nalmost any time. A tree will produce from fifty to one hundred nuts each\r\nyear. If you were to go into an apple, a peach, or a cherry orchard, you\r\ncould easily pick the ripe fruit. Gathering cocoanuts is quite a\r\ndifferent matter, however. Let us observe this shiny-skinned Samoan boy\r\nand see how he picks them. He fastens a short piece of rope in the form\r\nof a loop to each foot. Letting one of the loops catch on a rough place\r\non the bark of the tree he places the hollow of his foot against it,\r\nclasps the trunk with his hands, and raises himself a little. Then the\r\nother loop is fastened a little higher up, and he raises himself again.\r\nIn this way he finally reaches the nuts. With a knife he cuts off the\r\nripe ones, which fall to the ground and are then piled up. They are then\r\nplaced in baskets which are hung from a pole and carried on the\r\nshoulders of two men or are loaded on to donkeys and taken to the shed.\r\n\r\nThe ripe cocoanut is a valuable article of food just as it is picked\r\nfrom the tree. It contains also a milk which is a nourishing drink. Most\r\nof the cocoanut sent to other countries, however, is in a form known as\r\n_copra_.\r\n\r\nAt the shed the hard shell, which covers the meat, is split open by\r\nmeans of an ax. The meat is removed with a knife and is then spread out\r\non mats to dry. This dried cocoanut is copra.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of these cocoanut islands live in a much more simple\r\nstyle than we do, and the cocoanut tree supplies many of the things that\r\nthey use daily.\r\n\r\nLet us examine the home of a native Samoan. The frame and posts of the\r\nhouse are made of the slender trunks of the cocoanut palm, while the\r\nroof is covered with its leaves instead of with shingles. The cups,\r\nbowls, dippers, and many other household utensils are made of the\r\nshells. If a whole shell is wanted, the \"eyes\" are pushed in, the milk\r\nis used, and ants are allowed to eat the meat. These make excellent\r\nwater bottles. Baskets, curtains, and twine, are made from the fiber of\r\nthe leaves, and the bark is used for fuel.\r\n\r\nFrom the copra an oil is pressed which is used in the manufacture of\r\nsoap. It makes a perfectly white soap that will float on the water. It\r\nis also used to furnish light, and the people rub it on their bodies to\r\nprevent sunburn. The sap of the tree is made into sugar, vinegar, and a\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\nWhile in our country the cocoanut is important chiefly to bakers and\r\nconfectioners, in these far-away islands it is the most useful of\r\nplants, and one of the chief articles of food. Would you not like to\r\nvisit the cocoanut islands and learn more of their interesting people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BUNCH OF BANANAS\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery day, as you walk along the streets you see great bunches of\r\nbananas hanging in front of fruit and grocery stores. You find them at\r\nthe corner fruit stand, and peddlers carry them from house to house.\r\n\r\nAlthough bananas are so common now and so cheap that all can afford to\r\neat them, this was not so when your grandparents were children. In those\r\ndays the fruit was regarded as quite a luxury, for there were few people\r\nengaged in carrying it from its tropical home to the cities of our\r\ncountry. Now many small but swift ships, called \"fruiters,\" carry on\r\nthis business. They get their cargoes of fruit in the West Indies or\r\nCentral America, and within a week after sailing they are unloading at\r\nNew Orleans, Baltimore, New York, or Boston. If the number of bananas\r\nwhich reach our country each year were equally distributed, each person\r\nwould receive twenty-five.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--A Banana Tree.]\r\n\r\nLet us get aboard that wonderful train upon which all may travel free of\r\ncost, which runs equally well upon land and water. We step off right in\r\nthe center of a banana plantation on the island of Jamaica.\r\n\r\nYes, these are banana trees all about you. See how long and broad the\r\nleaves are and how gracefully they droop! Some of them are ten or\r\nfifteen feet long; almost as long as the trees are tall. The trees, you\r\nsee, are simply stalks from which the leaves unroll. Here you can see\r\nsome just starting out. They are rolls of bright green, pointing upward,\r\neach starting from the center of the stalk. No, the leaves were not torn\r\nin that way by the pickers. The wind sometimes whips them into ribbons,\r\nfor they are very tender.\r\n\r\nThese stalks growing from the base of the main stem are called \"suckers\"\r\nhere; in Costa Rica they are called \"bits.\" You remember that there are\r\nno seeds in bananas. It is these \"suckers\" that are planted when a\r\nfarmer wants to start a plantation. They are set out when two or three\r\nfeet high and within a year they bear fruit. What did I tell you about\r\nthe length of time required for the cocoanut to bear?\r\n\r\nIt is but four years since the trees in this plantation were single\r\n\"suckers,\" standing about fifteen feet apart. Now there are several\r\nstalks grouped about each parent plant, and the beautiful leaves,\r\ntouching overhead, form shaded aisles of green.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--A Banana Plantation.]\r\n\r\nOf course a great number of \"suckers\" are not allowed to grow together.\r\nKeeping these cut down is called \"cleaning the plantation.\"\r\n\r\nNow let us examine the fruit on this tree beside us. You see that the\r\ngreat cluster or bunch is made up of smaller bunches. These are called\r\n\"hands,\" and each banana is spoken of as a \"finger.\" Let us count the\r\n\"hands\" in this bunch. This is an unusually large one, for it contains\r\nthirteen. Nine \"hands\" make a _full bunch_. As you see, there are from\r\nten to twenty \"fingers\" in a \"hand.\" Buyers will seldom take bunches of\r\nless than six \"hands.\"\r\n\r\nHere come the fruit cutters to help get a cargo for the \"fruiter\" we saw\r\nat anchor.\r\n\r\nYes, the bananas are green, I know, and they are always green when\r\ngathered. They will ripen in the storehouses when they reach the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nNo, it is not a waste to cut down the stalks, for they die after bearing\r\ntheir fruit, and the smaller stalks about them will soon yield. Some of\r\nthese stalks, you see, have but one bunch and some have two or three.\r\nHow odd the bunches look with the \"fingers\" all pointing upward!\r\n\r\nThe banana leaves which the men are wrapping about the bunches are to\r\nprotect the fruit. It bruises very easily and great quantities are lost\r\non this account. They are not always wrapped, however.\r\n\r\nWhen the fruit reaches the vessel, it is carefully inspected; and if not\r\nin just the right condition, it is refused. The bunches which are\r\naccepted, are taken into the hold of the ship and packed closely\r\ntogether. The planter receives for these from ten to thirty-five cents a\r\nbunch. Just think of buying eight or nine dozen of bananas for ten\r\ncents!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Loading a Small Boat with Bananas to be taken\r\nto the \"Fruiter\" in the Harbor.]\r\n\r\nThe men will not stop work until the ship is loaded. It may take\r\ntwenty-four hours, and it may take twice that long, for a \"fruiter\" will\r\ncarry from fifteen to twenty thousand bunches of fruit.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Central America, where there are no harbors, the\r\nplanters float the fruit down the streams in canoes. The vessels anchor\r\nat some distance from the shore, and the bananas are taken out in boats\r\ncalled _dories_. They are hoisted up to the deck of the ship by means of\r\npulleys, and then packed in the hold. The thousands of bunches which are\r\nbruised in handling are thrown into the sea.\r\n\r\nWhile the northern ports get most of their supply of bananas from the\r\nWest Indies, the Pacific coast states are supplied from Central America.\r\nThe \"fruiters\" unload at New Orleans into trains, which carry the fruit\r\nto Los Angeles, San Francisco, and other places. Banana trains also run\r\nfrom New Orleans to St. Louis, Chicago, and other parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe fruit ships have great pipes or ventilators, which carry the cool,\r\nfresh air from the sea down into the hold. Sometimes when they reach\r\nport it is so cold that the bananas cannot be taken out for a few days.\r\nWagons are loaded with the fruit at the wharves, and it is taken to\r\nwarehouses where it gradually turns yellow. I am sure you have seen\r\nloads of the green fruit on the streets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--A \"Fruiter\" taking a Cargo of Bananas.]\r\n\r\nWhen the wholesale merchant sells the fruit, he often incloses each\r\nbunch in the rough material of which gunny sacks are made, and then puts\r\na light, circular frame, made of strips of wood, over it. This, you see,\r\nprotects the bananas. The grocer or fruit man takes hold of the frame\r\nwithout danger of mashing the fruit, lifts the bunch, and hangs it upon\r\na hook. The frame and sacking are then removed.\r\n\r\nBananas grow in the tropical parts of Asia and Africa and on many of the\r\nislands of the Pacific Ocean. They are also raised in Florida, and they\r\nripen in sheltered places in Southern California.\r\n\r\nYou have seen both yellow and red bananas. The red ones usually bring\r\nthe higher price, but they do not keep well and are not so extensively\r\nraised as the yellow ones.\r\n\r\nThe banana is an important article of food. It is much more nourishing\r\nthan potatoes or even good, white bread. A flour or meal can be made\r\nfrom the fruit by drying it and then grinding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DATES GROW\r\n\r\n\r\nThree thousand years before the shepherds followed the star to the\r\nmanger at Bethlehem, the beautiful date palm was cultivated beside the\r\nbanks of the Euphrates and the Nile rivers. The date was the bread of\r\nthe people who lived in these fertile valleys, and it is an important\r\narticle of food in northern Africa, Arabia, and Persia to-day.\r\n\r\nLook at a map of northern Africa, and you will see that the great Sahara\r\ncovers a large part of it. Here and there across the drifting sands wind\r\ncaravan routes, traveled by camels ridden by strangely dressed men.\r\nThese routes lead to beautiful garden spots called _oases_. Here are\r\nwells and springs, with little streams flowing in the shade of fig, date\r\npalm, and other trees. The people who dwell within these groves beside\r\nthe cooling waters look out upon the desert as the inhabitants of an\r\nisland might look upon the boundless sea. Find some of these oases and\r\nlearn why they are fertile. The people who live in these oases depend\r\nupon dates for their living. The dreary journey from the coast to the\r\ninterior is made to procure quantities of this fruit, which are wanted\r\nby the outside world.\r\n\r\nIf you were to make a journey in a desert country, you would find that\r\nyou could not carry such articles of food as you would have if you\r\nremained at home. The sunshine beats down fiercely, the springs and\r\nwells are far apart, and the patient animals must not be overloaded. The\r\nchief article of food carried is the date. A mass is packed together\r\nuntil it is so hard that pieces are chopped off with a hatchet when they\r\nare wanted.\r\n\r\nLike the cocoanut palm, the date palm rises to a great height, sometimes\r\nfifty or sixty feet, without branches. It ends in a crown of beautiful\r\nfeathery leaves which droop downward. These leaves may be ten or fifteen\r\nfeet long. Many of them stand edgewise. Unlike most trees, the trunk\r\ndoes not steadily increase in size, and you can tell nothing as to\r\nthe age of the tree by its diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--Date Palms loaded with Ripe Fruit, Biskra,\r\nAlgeria. (Year Book U. S. Department of Agriculture, 1900.)]\r\n\r\nIn its wild state many shoots spring from the base of the tree. These\r\nmay grow as high as the parent stalk, so that in time a jungle or\r\nthicket is formed.\r\n\r\nThe flowers, which are clear white, grow in clusters. There are from six\r\nto twenty of these clusters on a tree, each of which produces a bunch of\r\ndates. The female tree bears the fruit. The blossoms are pollinated both\r\nby the wind and by man.\r\n\r\nThere are from ten to fifteen pounds of dates in a bunch. A tree will\r\naverage from one hundred to two hundred pounds each year, although trees\r\nhave been known to yield six hundred pounds. The trees yield when from\r\nfour to eight years old, and continue to bear for a century.\r\n\r\nThe dates, green at first, later in the year a yellowish brown, are,\r\nwhen ripe, amber or black in color.\r\n\r\nThe trees require a very dry, hot climate, but moist soil. Long, long\r\nago, this saying was common among the Arabs, \"The date palm, the queen\r\nof trees, must have her feet in running water and her head in the\r\nburning sky.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough there are lovely date palm trees on the grounds of many\r\nCalifornia homes, few of them bear fruit. The temperature must average\r\nfrom eighty to ninety degrees for a considerable time in the summer, in\r\norder to mature it. What is the average summer temperature in your\r\nlocality?\r\n\r\nIf an ordinary tree is frost-bitten, it recovers and soon puts out a new\r\ngrowth; but if the crown of the date palm be frozen, the tree dies.\r\n\r\nWhen the Moors went to Spain, in the eleventh century, they introduced\r\nthis valuable tree which the mission fathers several hundred years later\r\nbrought to Mexico and to Southern California.\r\n\r\nHow would you like to try to climb a date palm tree? Although they look\r\nso smooth and are without branches, the natives of the desert climb them\r\nwithout any help whatever. The trunk is always somewhat rough, and this\r\nmakes it possible to ascend them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--Date Palm Trees.]\r\n\r\nNot all of the dates in a bunch ripen at once, so they are usually\r\npicked by hand and only the ripe ones selected. Sometimes, however, the\r\nbunches are cut off. Some dates contain so much sap that the bunches\r\nmust be hung up to allow it to drain off before they can be shipped.\r\nThis sap is called _date honey_, and is saved. They are sent to the\r\ncoast towns in bags or boxes called _frails_. Where dates are to be sold\r\nin small quantities, they are repacked in the small boxes such as you\r\nhave seen.\r\n\r\nYou know that dates are very sweet, and it is no wonder that they are,\r\nfor they contain from fifty-five to sixty per cent of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe trees are often tapped, and the sap which flows out is made into\r\nsugar. Vinegar and a liquor called _arrack_ are also made from it. The\r\nleaves of the tree are made into bags and mats; from the stones a drink\r\nis made which takes the place of coffee. From the leafstalks baskets are\r\nmade, while the trunk furnishes material for houses and for fences.\r\n\r\nIf the dates could speak, they could tell us many wonderful stories of\r\nthe far East, of the river boats on the Nile, of the drifting sands\r\nwhich come so close to the river's banks, of the caravans creeping over\r\nthe desert toward the green oases and then fading out of sight, bearing\r\nloads of this food to the countries where it is not produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORANGE GROVES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PASADENA, CALIFORNIA, Jan. 4, 1902.\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIEND WILL: I was very glad to receive your letter, and much\r\nsurprised to know that you are living on a farm. I am glad that you\r\ndescribed the raising of cranberries, for I did not know much about it\r\nbefore. When I told my teacher about getting the letter, she asked me to\r\nread it in the geography class and to show the pictures. I asked our\r\ngrocery-man where he gets his cranberries, and found that some of them\r\ncame from Wareham.\r\n\r\nYou are having cold weather now, I know. Is the skating good? I have not\r\nseen ice as thick as window glass since we came to California, except\r\nthat delivered by the iceman. Just now there is a beautiful covering of\r\nsnow on the mountains a few miles north and east of town. Just think of\r\npicking roses and callas with snow in plain sight! The snow never\r\nremains more than a day or two on these mountains.\r\n\r\nSoon after we came to Pasadena, father bought an orange grove of\r\ntwenty-five acres. We are picking the fruit now. People began to pick\r\noranges several weeks ago, and the work will continue all winter.\r\n\r\nOrange trees are planted about twenty feet apart, but the groves do not\r\nlook as apple orchards do in the East, for no grass is allowed to grow\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nThe best orange section is east of here, near Redlands and Riverside,\r\nbut some good fruit is raised near Pasadena also.\r\n\r\nFather keeps our trees pruned down rather low, so that it is easier to\r\npick the oranges than it would be if they were allowed to grow very\r\ntall.\r\n\r\nOrange raising is like cranberry growing in one way--the land must be\r\nirrigated in each case. Here the water is piped from the mountain\r\nstreams and from tunnels. We form basins about ten feet square around\r\neach tree and fill them with water. Most of our irrigating is done\r\nduring the summer, as the winter is our rainy season. _You_ would not\r\ncall it a very rainy time. Our average is about twenty inches for the\r\nwhole year.\r\n\r\nThe trees in our grove have been set out about six years, and they are\r\nbearing nicely now. Orange trees begin to bear when they are four years\r\nold; so, you see, we have to wait a little longer for a crop than you do\r\nfor a crop of cranberries. It costs a good deal to start an orange\r\ngrove. Trees cost from one dollar to one and one-half dollars each at\r\nthe nurseries. A few years ago they sold for twenty cents each.\r\n\r\nI wish that you could see the trees when they are in full blossom, and\r\nalso when they are loaded with the golden fruit. I am going to put some\r\norange blossoms into the envelope, but I am afraid they will not reach\r\nyou in very good condition. They are very fragrant, and you can smell\r\ntheir perfume some distance from a tree in blossom.\r\n\r\nTo-day we picked about two hundred and fifty boxes of oranges. We always\r\nspeak of _picking_ them, although they are not picked, but cut. You\r\nsee, if they were picked off, the part where the stem pulled off would\r\nsoon begin to decay.\r\n\r\nWe take a wagon load of fruit boxes, and, while father drives slowly\r\nbetween the rows of trees, I throw them off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Picking Oranges in California.]\r\n\r\nEach picker carries a sack slung over one shoulder, and as fast as he\r\ncuts off an orange, he drops it into the sack. The sacks are emptied\r\ninto the boxes, and these are loaded on to the wagon. Father pays five\r\ncents a box for picking, and a good picker will gather about forty boxes\r\nin a day.\r\n\r\nWe sell most of our oranges to fruit companies. These companies pack and\r\nship the fruit. At the packing houses the oranges are placed in tubs of\r\nwater and scrubbed with small brushes. Many women, girls, and boys work\r\nat this. The washing is to take off dirt, and also _scale_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Grading and Packing Oranges.]\r\n\r\nAfter the oranges are washed, they are placed in a sort of trough which\r\nis highest at the end near the tub. They roll down this trough to the\r\n_grader_. This is a machine so arranged that the oranges pass through\r\ndifferent openings according to their size, and come out sorted.\r\n\r\nIn the warehouse close by they are wrapped and packed. Chinamen often do\r\nthis work. Each orange is wrapped in a separate piece of paper, which\r\nhas the brand of the company stamped upon it. It is then packed firmly\r\nin a box. A certain number of oranges of each grade fill a box,\r\nninety-six of the largest grade, and about two hundred of the smallest.\r\nThose which are too small, as well as the imperfect oranges, are\r\nrejected. These are called _culls_. Sometimes these are sold for a low\r\nprice, and sometimes they are thrown away by wagon loads.\r\n\r\nAfter the boxes are filled, they are placed in special fruit cars and\r\nhurried to St. Louis, Chicago, New York, Boston, and other cities.\r\n\r\nYes, the Weather Bureau is of great help to fruit growers. Of course we\r\nhave very little winter here, but oranges will not endure much cold. The\r\nmercury falls below the freezing point but a few times each season. On\r\nNew Year's Day the temperature here was fifty-eight degrees. I looked up\r\nthe Boston temperature for the same day and found that it was only four\r\ndegrees above zero. When the Bureau predicts a sharp freeze, the farmers\r\nbuild small fires in their orchards, or turn on a good deal of water.\r\nThe fires are built in small wire baskets. They make a smudge instead of\r\na flame. The people in the raisin districts watch the weather reports\r\npretty closely, for rain injures the drying grapes.\r\n\r\nGrowers have to _spray_ or _fumigate_ the trees to destroy the scale\r\nthat I spoke of which is a great enemy of the orange, to kill the\r\ninsects, and to wash off dirt. This is sometimes done by putting a great\r\npiece of canvas over the tree, forming a sort of tent which prevents the\r\nfumes from escaping. It was found that the ladybugs would eat the scale\r\nand so they were brought into California from the East. They do a great\r\ndeal of good, but still we have to spray the trees.\r\n\r\nOrange trees are raised from the seed, and the trees produced in this\r\nway are called _seedlings_. By _budding_, a fruit much better than the\r\noranges grown on the seedling tree has been produced. There were five\r\nacres of seedlings in our grove, and father budded the trees. He cut\r\noff the limbs rather close to the trunk of the tree. Then he slipped\r\nbuds from _navel_ trees into cuts made through the bark in the end of\r\neach limb left on the tree. He then wound cord tightly about the limb\r\nand put on some wax. After a time a new growth started out where these\r\nbuds were placed. These new branches will bear much improved fruit.\r\n\r\nWe have a very fine variety of oranges called Washington Navels. Trees\r\nof this variety were obtained by our government from Brazil. Two of\r\nthese were brought to Riverside, a town about seventy-five miles east of\r\nPasadena, and planted on a ranch belonging to a Mr. Tibbits. They did\r\nwell, and all of the trees of this variety in Southern California were\r\nobtained from these two through budding. These trees are still living.\r\n\r\nCalifornia and Florida are the two important orange-growing states of\r\nour country. Father says the industry is much older in Florida than in\r\nour state. Florida growers can ship their fruit to market much cheaper\r\nthan we can. It costs us ninety cents for each box.\r\n\r\nMexico, the West Indies, Italy, southern France, and Spain are also\r\norange producers. These countries have the advantage of cheap labor,\r\nfather says.\r\n\r\nI wish that you could visit us. We would have fine times, I am sure.\r\n\r\nThe next time I write I will tell you about some of the other fruits\r\nraised in California.\r\n\r\n                            Your sincere friend,\r\n                                               FRANK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO A VINEYARD\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PASADENA, CALIFORNIA, Oct. 1, 1902.\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIEND WILL: Last week father went to Fresno, which is about three\r\nhundred miles northwest of here, in the San Joaquin valley. He took me\r\nwith him, and we visited some of the great vineyards and raisin-packing\r\nestablishments near and in that city.\r\n\r\nRaisins are simply dried grapes. Although there are many countries where\r\ngrapes grow, there are few where raisins are made. Dew, fog, and rain\r\ninjure the fruit, so that the San Joaquin valley, with its dry, hot\r\natmosphere, is well adapted to this industry.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many different kinds of grapes but only the green\r\nvariety is used in making raisins. The raisin grapes are called\r\n_muscats_. If the grapes are left on the vines long enough, they become\r\nraisins. I have picked some pretty good raisins from the vines. Of\r\ncourse by being spread out, they dry quicker and more evenly.\r\n\r\nThe sugar that you find on and in the raisins is not put there by the\r\npeople who dry the grapes. It comes from the juice of the grape.\r\n\r\nGrapevines grow from both roots and cuttings. Of course cuttings are the\r\ncheaper. Often they may be had for the asking. Many think that it is\r\nbetter to set out rooted vines than cuttings.\r\n\r\nThey are planted in rows from six feet apart to twelve or fifteen feet.\r\nDuring the first year the young vines will grow several feet. In the\r\nfall, when the flow of the sap has been checked by frost, the vines are\r\npruned. A vineyard in California looks quite different from one in the\r\nEast. During the winter it is simply so many rows of stumps several\r\ninches in thickness and one or two feet high. During the summer the\r\nbranches grow from these stumps and produce their beautiful clusters of\r\ngrapes, only to be cut off in the fall or winter.\r\n\r\nThe trimmings are generally burned in the vineyard at the same time that\r\nthey are cut off. A sort of furnace made of sheet iron is fastened\r\nbetween two wheels and drawn by horses up and down between the rows. A\r\nman pitches the cuttings into it, and they burn as it moves along.\r\n\r\nIn the early summer men go through the vineyards sprinkling a coating of\r\nsulphur on the vines. This is to prevent mildew, which damages the fruit\r\nvery much.\r\n\r\nDuring the last half of August and September the grapes are picked.\r\nSometimes the harvest continues into October. Most of the grapes had\r\nbeen gathered when we visited the vineyards.\r\n\r\nWhen the juice of the grapes is one fourth sugar, they are ready to\r\npick. The grower generally tells the condition by the taste and color of\r\nthe fruit, although there are instruments for determining the amount of\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\nLike oranges, grapes are cut from the vines and not picked. We saw great\r\ncompanies of Chinamen going through the vineyards cutting off the\r\nbeautiful clusters. These they placed on shallow, wooden trays to dry.\r\nIn a week or two, when the upper side of the clusters is pretty well\r\ndried, the grapes are turned. We saw the workmen place an empty tray,\r\nupside down, over the filled one. Then, holding the two together, they\r\nturned them over, and the grapes dropped into the tray that had been\r\nplaced on top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Picking Grapes.--Notice the Mountains in the\r\nBackground.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--Drying Raisin Grapes.]\r\n\r\nDuring this drying time the people watch the reports of the Weather\r\nBureau. In some places flags are displayed when rain is expected. As a\r\nrule the grape season is over before the rains begin.\r\n\r\nWhen the grapes are taken from the trays, they are placed in boxes\r\nholding about one hundred pounds each. These are called _sweat boxes_.\r\nHere the driest grapes absorb some of the moisture from the others, and\r\nthe mass becomes more uniform.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--A Vineyard after being Pruned.]\r\n\r\nAfter the drying process has been finished, the stems are rather\r\nbrittle. To make them softer and easier to handle, the grapes are next\r\nplaced in a cool room and left there for a time.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting some of the vineyards, we drove to one of the great\r\npacking establishments in Fresno. These packing houses are nearly always\r\nin the cities and towns, because there help can be easily obtained. The\r\npacking house that we visited employs four hundred people, mostly girls\r\nand women.\r\n\r\nThe raisins are first placed on wooden or metal frames the size of a\r\nraisin box. These are called _forms_, and the packers are paid according\r\nto the number of forms filled. When these are filled, the raisins are\r\ncarefully transferred to the boxes.\r\n\r\nA box of raisins weighs twenty pounds, but there are half boxes and\r\nquarter boxes put up also. A paper is placed on the bottom of each box,\r\nand over the raisins another is placed. On top of this there is a fancy\r\npaper on which the name of the packer is stamped.\r\n\r\nIn most establishments there are three grades of raisins, Imperial\r\nClusters, London Layers, and the loose and imperfect stems.\r\n\r\nSometimes a second crop of grapes is gathered a little later in the\r\nfall. Of course these do not dry so well because the days are shorter,\r\nit is cooler, and rains sometimes occur. On this account they are dipped\r\nin lye and then rinsed in water. The lye cracks the skin, and so the\r\njuice evaporates more quickly. These are called Valencia raisins. There\r\nis not a very good market for these, so that people do not dip them so\r\ncommonly now as they used to.\r\n\r\nWe saw the machine where the raisins are _stemmed_. They pass from a\r\nhopper into a space between two woven-wire cylinders. The inner one\r\nrevolves within the other. In this way the raisins are broken from the\r\nstems. They are then run through a fanning mill which cleans them, and\r\nthey are finally graded by passing through screens having openings of\r\ndifferent sizes.\r\n\r\nMost of the seedless raisins are made from seedless grapes, but there\r\nare machines for removing the seeds from the grapes which contain them.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent of the packing house said that nearly all of the\r\nraisins that we import come from Spain, and that they are exported\r\nchiefly from the city of Malaga.\r\n\r\nThe purple and other _wine grapes_ are taken to the wineries and sold by\r\nthe ton, to be made into wine.\r\n\r\nThere are many other things that I should like to write about, but my\r\nletter is a pretty long one now, so I will close.\r\n\r\n                                Your loving friend,\r\n                                                 FRANK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUTTING\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever gone into the woods on a beautiful autumn day? The bright,\r\nwarm sunshine floods the earth where the trees are far apart and sifts\r\ndown through the branches. All nature seems to invite you to lie down\r\nunder a tree and dream. It was on such a day that Rip Van Winkle fell\r\ninto his long sleep.\r\n\r\nHow pretty the trees look in their fall suits of yellow, crimson, red,\r\nand brown! What a rustling is made as your feet tread the carpet of\r\nleaves!\r\n\r\nThe breezes pass among the branches and whisper a message to the\r\nbright-colored leaves. They understand and obey. Singly, in groups, and\r\nin showers, they silently float downward. By night and by day they fall,\r\nbut soon this carpet will be changed for one of white.\r\n\r\nListen! The leaves are not the only things that are falling. You can\r\nhear the _thump_, _thump_ of nuts as they drop from their lofty perches\r\nin the walnut and hickory-nut trees.\r\n\r\nSit down quietly on that log and you will soon see the busy nut\r\ngatherers. With their tails curled over their backs, they race up and\r\ndown the trees, or spring from branch to branch, carrying their precious\r\nburdens to their homes in the hollows of trunk or limb. Now one sits up\r\nstraight, holding a nut between his paws, and turning it slowly as he\r\ncracks and eats it. If he sees you, he whisks out of sight, or scolds\r\nyou from a safe place far above the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen the winter winds are whistling through the leafless trees, and\r\nsnows are drifting over the ground, these little nut gatherers feast to\r\ntheir hearts' content.\r\n\r\nThe squirrels do not gather all of the nuts. Children and grown people\r\nenjoy nutting. When there are not enough nuts on the ground, the men and\r\nboys climb the trees to shake them off. Then everybody hunts among the\r\nleaves for the treasures.\r\n\r\nSome of the most important nuts are walnuts, hickory nuts, hazelnuts,\r\nalmonds, chestnuts, Brazil nuts, pecans, and peanuts.\r\n\r\nMany of the hickory nuts fall out of their coverings bright and clean.\r\nWalnuts generally have to be _shucked_, and the juice stains the hands\r\nalmost black.\r\n\r\nAs hazelnuts grow on bushes, they can be easily picked. They usually\r\ndrop out of their burs after there have been a few frosts.\r\n\r\nMany nuts are gathered in the woods, but in some places the trees are\r\ncultivated just as fruit trees are.\r\n\r\nWe usually eat nuts between meals, or as a dessert. They are not simply\r\ndainties, but are very valuable articles of food. In some countries the\r\npoor people depend upon them for food.\r\n\r\nIn almost any city of our country are to be found the nuts that I have\r\nmentioned, with perhaps several other kinds. These have come from\r\ndifferent states, some from Canada, some from Brazil, and some from\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nI am sure you will enjoy gathering nuts of different kinds, so let us\r\nset out on a nutting expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WALNUT VACATION\r\n\r\n\r\nHow would you like to have your school close for two weeks, so that you\r\ncould gather walnuts? Every year many of the boys and girls of Southern\r\nCalifornia are given a vacation just for this purpose. It is called the\r\n\"walnut vacation,\" and occurs in the month of October.\r\n\r\nThese children do not take their baskets and go off to the woods where\r\nthey can romp and play, watch the squirrels, and gather beautiful autumn\r\nleaves. They gather nuts from the trees which their parents own, for in\r\nSouthern California there are many walnut ranches or groves. You see the\r\nvacation means a vacation for work instead of for play.\r\n\r\nWalnut trees are set out in rows just as apple trees are, but their\r\nroots and branches extend to such a distance from the trunks that they\r\nneed to be about twice as far apart.\r\n\r\nThe walnut harvest, which begins about the first of October, is a busy\r\ntime. Men, women, boys, and girls may be seen in the groves, shaking the\r\nnuts from the trees, picking them up, and putting them into sacks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--A Walnut Grove.]\r\n\r\nThe men shake the trees, and there is a shower of nuts to the earth. Do\r\nnot go under the branches now unless you want to be pelted. A single\r\ntree has been known to yield three hundred pounds of nuts in a season.\r\n\r\nWhen the trees have been given a good shaking, there are still some nuts\r\nclinging to the branches. These are obtained by shaking the limbs\r\nseparately, by means of long poles, to the ends of which wire hooks are\r\nfastened. As all of the nuts do not ripen at the same time, the trees\r\nare sometimes gone over two or three times.\r\n\r\nNow the boys, girls, and women go to work filling pails and baskets and\r\nemptying them into sacks, for they can do this work as well as men.\r\n\r\nUsually the nuts drop out of their covering or _shuck_ when they strike\r\nthe ground; but if they do not, the _shuck_ must be removed. Sometimes\r\nthe covering is cut off. If you handle the nuts with your bare hands,\r\nthey will be stained almost black, and you will have to let the color\r\nwear off.\r\n\r\nThe days are bright and warm, and this sort of nutting becomes rather\r\ntiresome before sundown. The work must be done and the vacation is not a\r\nvery long one, so each does his part cheerfully.\r\n\r\nWhen the nuts have been gathered, they are taken to the shed or place\r\nwhere they are to be washed. Here they are poured into a large wire\r\ncylinder which revolves in a tank filled with water. The machine is\r\nturned by a horse walking round and round, and it both washes and grades\r\nthe nuts. The smaller ones pass through the meshes in the wire and are\r\ncalled _second grade_. The larger ones are known as _first grade_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--Washing, Drying, and Sacking Walnuts.]\r\n\r\nWhen the walnuts come out of the washer, they are spread out on shallow,\r\nwooden trays to dry. Sometimes several thousand trays may be seen on\r\none ranch. They are loaded on to a small car and pushed to the part of\r\nthe field where they are wanted.\r\n\r\nIf there is no foggy or cloudy weather, they will dry in about five\r\ndays, but if there is, it may take ten.\r\n\r\nAfter the nuts are thoroughly dried, the trays are placed on the car and\r\npushed to the _bleacher_. This is a large box made of tarred paper. It\r\nis placed over the trays, and a quantity of sulphur is burned in it.\r\nThis is simply to whiten the shells, for they sell for a higher price\r\nwhen they are bleached. Sometimes the nuts are whitened by dipping them\r\ninto a liquid preparation.\r\n\r\nThe nuts are now sacked and marked, ready to ship. Soon after the boys\r\nand girls have finished their \"walnut vacation,\" the nuts are on their\r\nway to the eastern part of the United States.\r\n\r\nMost of the walnuts raised in California have soft shells. Some have\r\nsuch thin shells that they are called \"paper shells.\" The walnuts that\r\ngrow in the woods of Indiana, Illinois, and other states have hard\r\nshells. They are dark in color and are called _black walnuts_. The trees\r\nare quite valuable, as the wood is used in making furniture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHESTNUTS\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us go on a chestnutting expedition to the southern part of France.\r\nWe can gather the nuts in many of the states of our own country, but the\r\ntrip to a strange land will be enjoyed by all.\r\n\r\nThe chestnut trees, many of which are very old, spread their branches to\r\ngreat distances. The nuts, as you see, are inclosed in a _bur_ or coat\r\nwhich covers the shell. There are generally two nuts in each bur.\r\n\r\nWhen _you_ eat chestnuts, you eat them as a sort of dainty, not as a\r\nregular article of food. This is not the case in the home of Jean, the\r\nboy who is helping his father fill those sacks. In his home, as in many\r\nhomes in southern Europe, the nuts form one of the chief articles of\r\ndaily food.\r\n\r\nIn the winter Jean sells the freshly roasted nuts on a street corner in\r\nthe city of Lyons. He gets a good many pennies each noon from workmen\r\nand poor people generally, who use them for their midday meal. He sells\r\nten nuts for a penny.\r\n\r\nThis is not the only way in which they are eaten. Jean's mother boils\r\nthem with celery and mashes them as we do potatoes. The nuts are also\r\nground into a flour from which bread is made. They are often used in the\r\ndressing for fowls.\r\n\r\nConfectioners use great quantities of chestnuts. In Lyons there are\r\nestablishments where as many as two hundred persons are employed in\r\npreparing them.\r\n\r\nThe nuts are first peeled, and then boiled in clear water, which removes\r\nthe thin coating next the kernel. They are then placed in a sirup\r\nflavored with Mexican vanilla, in which they remain for about three\r\ndays. After draining, they are coated with vanilla or chocolate and\r\npacked in attractive boxes. In this form they are worth forty-five or\r\nfifty cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BAG OF PEANUTS\r\n\r\n\r\nLast summer Harry's parents took him with them on a visit to Virginia.\r\nHarry has always lived in New York City, and the country life of the\r\nSouth was very interesting to him.\r\n\r\nThey visited friends who live on a beautiful _plantation_, as the farms\r\nin the South are called. A driveway lined with grand old trees leads\r\nthrough the flower-studded lawn up to the retired manor house, whose\r\nwide verandas completely circle it round.\r\n\r\nBeyond the house are the stables where work horses, driving horses, and\r\nsaddle horses are kept; and beyond these is the pretty little boathouse,\r\nstanding on the bank of a small river that winds its way through the\r\nplantation.\r\n\r\nThe morning after Harry arrived, his friend Bert asked him if he would\r\nlike to go across the river to see the men harvest peanuts.\r\n\r\nNow whenever Harry had wanted peanuts, he had always gone to a stand\r\nand bought a sack. He had never thought about where they came from. He\r\nhad heard of shaking nuts from trees, so he supposed that they were\r\ngoing to the woods.\r\n\r\nHe was therefore much surprised when Bert took him to a field across the\r\nriver where men were plowing vines from the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Do peanuts grow in the ground?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course they do,\" answered Bert.\r\n\r\n\"I thought that nuts grew on trees,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Father says that the peanut is not a _real_ nut,\" replied his friend.\r\n\"He says they should be called _ground nuts_ or _ground peas_.\" He\r\npulled up one of the vines, and the boys threw themselves down under a\r\ntree to examine it.\r\n\r\nWhen the small clods of soil clinging to the roots of the plant had been\r\nremoved, Harry saw a number of pods which he recognized as peanuts.\r\n\r\nOpening one of the pods, Bert took out the kernels.\r\n\r\n\"These,\" said he, \"are the _seeds_, and they are planted much as other\r\nseeds are.\r\n\r\n\"Before they are planted the shell must be removed, but we have to be\r\ncareful not to break the thin skin that covers the kernel. If that be\r\nbroken, the seed will not grow.\r\n\r\n\"The kernels are planted about one foot apart, in rows that are, as you\r\nsee, about three feet apart. Sometimes they are planted by hand and\r\nsometimes by machinery.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if peanuts are raised in the country around New York,\" said\r\nHarry.\r\n\r\n\"No, I think not,\" replied Bert, \"for they are very easily killed by\r\nfrost. Great quantities are raised in North Carolina and in Tennessee.\r\nFather says that the negroes of western Africa raised them long, long\r\nbefore they were known in the United States. He says that they are a\r\nvery important article of food there, and that whole villages take part\r\nin the planting and harvesting.\r\n\r\n\"After the vines blossom,\" continued Bert, \"a very strange thing\r\nhappens.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Harry.\r\n\r\n\"The flower stalks bend downward and push themselves right into the\r\nsoil, and on these the pods develop. If the stalks do not enter the\r\nearth within a few hours after the flowers fall, they die.\"\r\n\r\nHarry now watched the plowing. The plows were drawn up and down the rows\r\nand ran directly under the vines, lifting them out of the soil. After\r\nthey had been plowed out about two hours, men took them upon pitchforks\r\nand piled them up. Harry noticed that some of the piles were covered\r\nwith corn fodder, and asked why this was. Bert told him that it was to\r\nkeep out the rain.\r\n\r\n\"What happens to the nuts after the vines have been piled up?\" said\r\nHarry.\r\n\r\n\"They remain in the piles fifteen or twenty days, and are then spread\r\nout on the ground or hauled to the barn, where the nuts are picked off,\"\r\nanswered Bert. \"Sometimes they are picked by hand and sometimes by\r\nmachinery. Let us go to the lower field; we have an earlier variety\r\nthere, and the nuts are being picked now.\"\r\n\r\nThey found men, women, and children picking the pods one by one and\r\ndropping them into baskets. These were emptied into sacks. Harry tried\r\nto lift one of these, and was surprised to find it so heavy. Bert told\r\nhim that it weighed about one hundred pounds.\r\n\r\n\"Do you burn the vines after the nuts are picked?\" asked Harry.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Bert, \"they are fed to the cattle. We call the vines _peanut\r\nhay_.\"\r\n\r\nBert explained that his father sold the sacks of nuts to the factory,\r\nwhere they were cleaned and sorted.\r\n\r\nThe next day the boys went to town and visited the peanut factory.\r\n\r\nThe nuts were first put through a machine which removed the dirt. They\r\nwere then polished and sorted into four grades. The poorest grade is\r\nused in making peanut candy. The nuts were then sacked, and were ready\r\nto be shipped to the North.\r\n\r\nHarry learned that an oil is made from the nuts which is used as olive\r\noil is used, and also that peanut butter is produced from them. He\r\nfound that many men were employed on plantations all through Virginia\r\nand other states of the South, in raising the peanuts that are sold on\r\nthe streets of every city and town in our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASSORTED NUTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Thanksgiving dinner had been eaten, the nuts were passed, and\r\nthe children asked Uncle John to tell them something about a few of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said he. \"You pick out the ones that you want to know\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\nFrank handed him an almond.\r\n\r\n\"This nut,\" said Uncle John, \"came from sunny Spain. It grew not far\r\nfrom the blue Mediterranean. Almonds are raised in most parts of\r\nsouthern Europe and in the northern part of Africa. Ages ago they grew\r\nin the Holy Land, and are mentioned in the Bible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do almonds grow in any part of our country?\" asked Helen.\r\n\r\n\"I think they grow in California,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said Uncle John. \"There are many almond orchards in the\r\nsouthern part of the state.\r\n\r\n\"An almond tree in full bloom is a beautiful sight. The blossoms are\r\nwhite, tinted with pink, and as they appear before the leaves do, there\r\nis nothing to hide them.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--Almond Trees in Full Bloom.]\r\n\r\n\"Does the nut have a covering?\" inquired Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Uncle John. \"When the nut is ripe, the shuck opens\r\ngradually, and sometimes the nuts fall out.\r\n\r\n\"When people have large orchards, they spread pieces of canvas under\r\nthe trees and then shake them or beat them by means of long poles.\r\n\r\n\"The nuts that do not fall out of the shucks are obtained by opening the\r\nshuck with a knife. The nuts are then dried, and are ready for market.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as Uncle John had finished, Mary handed him a hazelnut. \"Please\r\ntell about this one,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"I have often gone hazel nutting when I was a boy,\" said her uncle.\r\n\"Hazelnuts grow on bushes in thickets. They are six or eight feet high\r\nand very slender. Baskets are sometimes made of them, and I have often\r\nused them for arrows.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes the nuts grow singly, and sometimes in groups of two or\r\nthree. A bur covers the nut, which sticks very closely until it is ripe.\r\nThen the nuts often fall out.\r\n\r\n\"After I had gathered the hazelnuts, I used to spread them out on the\r\nroof of the wood house to dry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nuts that look just like these are called filberts,\" said Helen.\r\n\r\n\"Filberts are cultivated hazelnuts,\" replied Uncle John; \"they are\r\nlarger than the wild ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would like to know how this nut grows,\" said Helen, handing her uncle\r\na black nut shaped like a triangular prism.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said Uncle John, \"came from Brazil, and is called a Brazil nut.\r\nDo you know where Brazil is?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is in the northeastern part of South America,\" replied Helen.\r\n\r\n\"The great Amazon River is in Brazil, and it flows through tropical\r\nforests,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Much of our coffee comes from Brazil,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\nUncle John then told the children that Brazil nuts come from the\r\nnorthern part of Brazil and from the Orinoco valley.\r\n\r\nHelen asked if they grow as walnuts and hickory nuts do.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered her uncle, \"they grow inside of a great case or shell.\r\nThere are from eighteen to twenty-five in one shell, which is nearly as\r\nlarge as a man's head.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are the nuts got out of the shells?\" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\"When they fall, men break them open and take out the nuts,\" replied\r\nUncle John. \"Most of them are sent down the Amazon to the city of Para\r\nand from there shipped to the United States and other countries.\"\r\n\r\nNone of the children knew where Para is situated, so they all went to\r\nthe library to look at the atlas. After they had located it, Uncle John\r\ntold them of his visit to the city and of the wonderful things which he\r\nsaw on a steamboat trip up the Amazon River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STRANGE CONVERSATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening after I had been reading for some time, I went to the\r\nkitchen to get a drink of water. That part of the house was dark and\r\nquiet, and as I stepped through the doorway, I heard low, musical\r\nvoices, apparently in the pantry. I was very much surprised, you may be\r\nsure, and I kept perfectly still, and listened.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said a voice, which I could barely hear, \"I am a long way from\r\nhome indeed, and sometimes it makes me quite lonely when I think of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us about your home, and how you lived,\" said another low voice.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" began the first speaker, \"my name is _Pepper_. With twenty-five\r\nor thirty brothers and sisters I grew in a cluster on a vine. We were\r\nbut a small part of the family, for there were similar clusters all over\r\nour vine. We were about as large as peas, and grew somewhat after the\r\nfashion of currants.\r\n\r\n\"All about were other vines to which friends and relatives were\r\nattached. Pepper vines are always anxious to get to the top, and so some\r\nof these vines climbed trees and some twined themselves about poles,\r\nwhich men had set in the ground for this purpose. Our vine was three or\r\nfour years old when we appeared on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long did you live on the vine?\" asked a voice that I had not heard\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"Only a few months,\" replied Pepper. \"You see, we had to make room for\r\nanother set of berries. Two sets appear each year for twenty years or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\"Under the influence of the tropical sunshine and the warm rains we grew\r\nday by day, and we were as happy as the butterflies and birds about us.\r\nBy and by we began to turn red. All of this time a _hull_ or coat was\r\nforming on the outside of our bodies.\r\n\r\n\"Before we became entirely red, workmen came to the field, and, by\r\nrubbing us between their hands, separated us from the stems to which we\r\nlovingly clung.\r\n\r\n\"After having been picked, I was, with many others, placed upon a mat to\r\ndry. These mats were all about us, each covered with berries. After\r\nbeing thoroughly dried we were put into a mill and ground, and I became\r\nwhat I am now, _Black Pepper_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there other kinds of pepper?\" asked some one.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Pepper, \"there is _White Pepper_, and _Red_, or _Cayenne\r\nPepper_. Some of my friends were made into White Pepper. They were\r\nsoaked in limewater for about two weeks, and this, of course, softened\r\nand wrinkled their hulls which had always fitted so nicely. This was bad\r\nenough, but it was not the worst.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened next?\" said several voices.\r\n\r\n\"They were then,\" continued Pepper, \"trodden under the bare feet of\r\ndark-skinned men, and this rubbed off their hulls completely. After this\r\nthey were ground as we had been.\r\n\r\n\"Cayenne Pepper is not a member of our family at all, although it has\r\nthe same name. I have looked up its genealogy, and I find that it\r\nreceived its name from the city of Cayenne, in French Guiana, near which\r\nit grows. It is in the form of bell-shaped pods, and grows on low, bushy\r\nplants instead of vines.\r\n\r\n\"The pods are green at first, but red when ripe. No doubt you have seen\r\nstrings of them hanging in the grocery store when you were on the\r\nshelves. People sometimes use the pods as they are, but usually they are\r\ndried, ground, mixed with yeast, and baked into flat cakes like\r\ncrackers. When these cakes are ground, Red, or Cayenne Pepper, is\r\nproduced. It is put up in little boxes just as we are.\r\n\r\n\"Pepper used to be regarded as a great luxury,\" the speaker went on.\r\n\"Until the eighteenth century the Portuguese handled almost all of it.\r\nIt was not uncommon for rents to be paid with pepper. If any of you have\r\nread ancient history, you know that when Alaric took Rome he demanded,\r\namong other things, one thousand pounds of pepper as a ransom.\r\n\r\n\"My home was in the East Indies,\" said Pepper, \"but there are members\r\nof our family living in the Philippines, India, Mexico, the West Indies,\r\nand other tropical countries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your story is a very interesting one,\" said a voice, \"and now, if you\r\ncare to hear it, I will tell something of my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, do tell us,\" said several at once.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I will follow the example of our friend Pepper and introduce\r\nmyself at once. I am known as Ginger. I have relatives living in China,\r\nin India, and in the western part of Africa, but I came from the West\r\nIndies. The Ginger family is not like that of Pepper; it has no lofty\r\nnotions.\"\r\n\r\nPepper seemed a little inclined to get angry, so Ginger hastened to say:\r\n\"I mean that our vines do not climb trees or poles, but run along the\r\nground. I was a _root_ and not a _fruit_.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I was about a year old I, with countless friends, was dug from the\r\nground. We were cut from the vines and put into vats of scalding water.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was _dreadful_,\" said Pepper.\r\n\r\n\"We were treated in that way to prevent us from _sprouting_,\" continued\r\nGinger. \"After being taken out of the water, we were thoroughly dried\r\nand then ground. We were then put up in cans and boxes and sold as\r\n_Black Ginger_. Others were scraped before being ground, and they were\r\nthen called _White Ginger_.\r\n\r\n\"We were placed on board a great ship and finally landed at New York.\r\nAfter remaining in a large store there for some time, I was brought to\r\nthe corner grocery, and so I found my way to this shelf.\r\n\r\n\"I am gradually wasting away, and I shall not last a great while longer.\r\nIn my tropical home I seemed to be of no use to anybody, while now I am\r\ncalled for frequently by the cook, and my services seem to be\r\nappreciated, so I am happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be of some real use in this world is the greatest joy of life,\"\r\nremarked a strange voice.\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment, and then Ginger said \"May we not hear\r\nfrom you, friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your stories almost make me believe that I am still in the land of my\r\nbirth,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nThere was a peculiar little rattle about the voice, which I recognized\r\nat once as belonging to Cinnamon.\r\n\r\n\"For several years I was rocked to and fro by gentle tropic breezes or\r\nlashed about by storms. From my perch I could see beautiful flowers,\r\nbright insects, and even serpents in the thicket at my feet. Birds of\r\nbrilliant plumage often perched upon me. My home was on the island of\r\nCeylon.\r\n\r\n\"It is often said that where there is much bark there is no bite. In my\r\nown case that is not so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand,\" said Ginger.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Cinnamon, laughing, \"I am _all_ bark, and I have\r\nconsiderable bite, as those who have tasted me know.\r\n\r\n\"I was taken from one of the smaller limbs of a cinnamon tree. I was\r\nslipped within a larger piece of bark, for we each rolled up when\r\nstripped from the limbs. A still larger piece was slipped over us and so\r\non until quite a bundle had been formed. Some were quite short, and some\r\nwere three feet in length.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   STORIES OF CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n                            BY\r\n\r\n                       ELLA M.
