GOTHARD RAILWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe give engravings of one of a type of eight-coupled locomotives\r\nconstructed for service on the St. Gothard Railway by Herr T.A. Maffei,\r\nof Munich. As will be seen from our illustrations, the engine has\r\noutside cylinders, these being 20.48 in. in diameter, with 24 in.\r\nstroke, and as the diameter of the coupled wheels is 3 ft. 10 in.,\r\nthe tractive force which the engine is capable of exerting amounts to\r\n(20.48² x 24) / 46 = 218.4 lb. for each pound of effective pressure per\r\nsquare inch on the pistons. This is an enormous tractive force, as it\r\nwould require but a mean effective pressure of 102½ lb. per square inch\r\non the pistons to exert a pull of 10 tons. Inasmuch, however, as the\r\nengine weighs 44 tons empty and 51 tons in working order, and as all\r\nthis weight is available for adhesion, this great cylinder power can be\r\nutilized. The cylinders are 6 ft. 10 in. apart from center to center,\r\nand they are well secured to the frames, as shown in Fig. 4. The frames\r\nare deep and heavy, being 1 3/8 in. thick, and they are stayed by a\r\nsubstantial box framing at the smokebox end, by a cast-iron footplate at\r\nthe rear end, and by the intermediate plate stays shown. The axle box\r\nguides are all fitted with adjusting wedges. The axle bearings are all\r\nalike, all being 7.87 in. in diameter by 9.45 in. long. The axles are\r\nspaced at equal distances of 4 ft. 3.1 in. apart, the total wheel base\r\nbeing thus 12 ft. 9.3 in. In the case of the 1st, 2d, and 3d axles, the\r\nsprings are arranged above the axle boxes in the ordinary way, those of\r\nthe 2d and 3d axles being coupled by compensating beams. In the case of\r\nthe trailing axle, however, a special arrangement is adopted. Thus, as\r\nwill be seen on reference to the longitudinal section and plan (Figs. 1\r\nand 2, first page), each trailing axle box receives its load through the\r\nhorizontal arm of a strong bell-crank lever, the vertical arm of which\r\nextends downward and has its lower end coupled to the adjoining end of a\r\nstrong transverse spring which is pivoted to a pair of transverse stays\r\nextending from frame to frame below the ash pan. This arrangement\r\nenables the spring for the trailing axle to be kept clear of the\r\nfirebox, thus allowing the latter to extend the full width between the\r\nframes. The trailing wheels are fitted with a brake as shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOCOMOTIVES FOR ST. GOTHARD RAILWAY.]\r\n\r\nThe valve motion is of the Gooch or stationary link type, the radius\r\nrods being cranked to clear the leading axle, while the eccentric rods\r\nare bent to clear the second axle. The piston rods are extended through\r\nthe front cylinder covers and are enlarged where they enter the\r\ncrossheads, the glands at the rear ends of cylinders being made in\r\nhalves. The arrangement of the motion generally will be clearly\r\nunderstood on reference to Figs. 1 and 2 without further explanation.\r\n\r\nThe boiler, which is constructed for a working pressure of 147 lb. per\r\nsquare inch, is unusually large, the barrel being 60.4 in. in diameter\r\ninside the outside rings; it is composed of plates 0.65 in. thick. The\r\nfirebox spreads considerably in width toward the top, as shown in the\r\nsection, Fig. 5, and to enable it to be got in the back plate of the\r\nfirebox casing is flanged outward, instead of inward as usual, so as to\r\nenable it to be riveted up after the firebox is in place. The inside\r\nfirebox is of copper and its crown is stayed directly to the crown\r\nof the casing by vertical stays, as shown, strong transverse stays\r\nextending across the boiler just above the firebox crown to resist the\r\nspreading action caused by the arrangement of the crown stays. The\r\nfiregrate is 6 ft. 11.6 in. long by 3 ft. 4 in. wide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. GOTHARD LOCOMOTIVES.]\r\n\r\nThe barrel contains 225 tubes 1.97 in. in diameter outside and 13 ft. 9½\r\nin. long between tube plates. On the top of the barrel is a large dome\r\ncontaining the regulator, as shown in Fig. 1, from which view the\r\narrangement of the gusset stays for the back plate of firebox casing and\r\nfor the smokebox tube plate will be seen. A grid is placed across the\r\nsmokebox just above the tubes, and provision is made, as shown in Figs.\r\n1 and 4, for closing the top of the exhaust nozzle, and opening a\r\ncommunication between the exhaust pipes and the external air when the\r\nengine is run reversed. The chimney is 15¾ in. in diameter at its lower\r\nend and 18.9 in. at the top. The chief proportions of the boiler are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                           Sq. ft\r\n\r\n  Heating surface: Tubes   1598.5\r\n                   Firebox  102.5\r\n                           ------\r\n                           1701.0\r\n\r\n  Firegrate area                                              23.3 [1]\r\n  Sectional area through tubes (disregarding ferrules)         3.5\r\n  Least sectional area of chimney.                             1.35\r\n  Ratio of firegrate area to heating surface.                  1:73\r\n  Ratio of flue area through tubes to firegrate area.          1:6.7\r\n  Ratio of least sectional area of chimney to firegrate area.  1:17.26\r\n\r\n[Transcribers note 1: Best guess, 2nd digit illegible]\r\n\r\nThe proportion of chimney area to grate is much smaller than in ordinary\r\nlocomotives, this proportion having no doubt been fixed upon to enable a\r\nstrong draught to be obtained with the engine running at a slow speed.\r\nOf the general fittings of the engine we need give no description, as\r\ntheir arrangement will be readily understood from our engravings, and\r\nin conclusion we need only say that the locomotive under notice is\r\naltogether a very interesting example of an engine designed for\r\nspecially heavy work.--_Engineering_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MERSEY RAILWAY TUNNEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work of connecting Liverpool with Birkenhead by means of a railway\r\ntunnel is now an almost certain success. It is probable that the entire\r\ncost of the tunnel works will amount to about half a million sterling.\r\nThe first step was taken about three years ago, when shafts were sunk\r\nsimultaneously on both sides of the Mersey. The engineers intrusted\r\nwith the plans were Messrs. Brunlees & Fox, and they have now as their\r\nresident representative Mr. A.H. Irvine, C.E. The contractor for the\r\nentire work is Mr. John Waddell, and his lieutenant in charge at both\r\nsides of the river is Mr. James Prentice. The post of mechanical\r\nengineer at the works is filled by Mr. George Ginty. Under these chiefs,\r\na small army of nearly 700 workmen are now employed night and day at\r\nboth sides of the river in carrying out the tunnel to completion. On\r\nthe Birkenhead side, the landward excavations have reached a point\r\nimmediately under Hamilton Square, where Mr. John Laird's statue is\r\nplaced, and here there will be an underground station, the last before\r\ncrossing the river, the length of which will be about 400 feet, with up\r\nand down platforms. Riverward on the Cheshire side, the excavators have\r\ntunneled to a point considerably beyond the line of the Woodside Stage;\r\nwhile the Lancashire portion of the subterranean work now extends to\r\nSt. George's Church, at the top of Lord street, on the one side, and\r\nMerseyward to upward of 90 feet beyond the quay wall, and nearly to the\r\ndeepest part of the river.\r\n\r\nWhen completed, the total length of the tunnel will be three miles one\r\nfurlong, the distance from wall to wall at each side of the Mersey being\r\nabout three-quarters of a mile. The underground terminus will be about\r\nChurch street and Waterloo place, in the immediate neighborhood of the\r\nCentral Station, and the tunnel will proceed from thence, in an almost\r\ndirect line, under Lord street and James street; while on the south side\r\nof the river it will be constructed from a junction at Union street\r\nbetween the London and Northwestern and Great Western Railways, under\r\nChamberlain street, Green lane, the Gas Works, Borough road, across the\r\nHaymarket and Hamilton street, and Hamilton square.\r\n\r\nDrainage headings, not of the same size of bore as the part of the\r\nrailway tunnel which will be in actual use, but indispensable as a means\r\nof enabling the railway to be worked, will act as reservoirs into which\r\nthe water from the main tunnel will be drained and run off to both sides\r\nof the Mersey, where gigantic pumps of great power and draught will\r\nbring the accumulating water to the surface of the earth, from whence\r\nit will be run off into the river. The excavations of these drainage\r\nheadings at the present time extend about one hundred yards beyond the\r\nmain tunnel works at each side of the river. The drainage shafts are\r\nsunk to a depth of 180 feet, and are below the lowest point of the\r\ntunnel, which is drained into them. Each drainage shaft is supplied\r\nwith two pumping sets, consisting of four pumps, viz., two of 20 in.\r\ndiameter, and two of 30 in. diameter. These pumps are capable of\r\ndischarging from the Liverpool shafts 6,100 gallons per minute, and from\r\nthe Birkenhead 5,040 gallons per minute; and as these pumps will be\r\nrequired for the permanent draining of the tunnel, they are constructed\r\nin the most solid and substantial manner. They are worked by compound\r\nengines made by Hathorn, Davey & Co., of Leeds, and are supplied\r\nwith six steel boilers by Daniel Adamson & Co., of Dukinfield, near\r\nManchester.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, there is in course of construction still\r\nmore powerful pumps of 40 in. diameter, which will provide against\r\ncontingencies, and prevent delay in case of a breakdown such as occurred\r\nlately on the Liverpool side of the works. The nature of the rock is\r\nthe new red sandstone, of a solid and compact character, favorable for\r\ntunneling, and yielding only a moderate quantity of water. The engineers\r\nhave been enabled to arrange the levels to give a minimum thickness of\r\n25 ft. and an average thickness of 30 ft. above the crown of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nBarges are now employed in the river for the purpose of ascertaining the\r\ndepth of the water, and the nature of the bottom of the river. It is\r\nsatisfactory to find that the rock on the Liverpool side, as the heading\r\nis advanced under the river, contains less and less water, and this the\r\nengineers are inclined to attribute to the thick bed of stiff bowlder\r\nclay which overlies the rock on this side, which acts as a kind of\r\n\"overcoat\" to the \"under garments.\" The depth of the water in one part\r\nof the river is found to be about 72 ft.; in the middle about 90 ft.;\r\nand as there is an intermediate depth of rock of about 27 ft., the\r\ndistance is upward of 100 ft. from the surface of low water to the top\r\nof the tunnel.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the work will shortly be pushed forward at a much\r\ngreater speed than has hitherto been the case, for in place of the\r\nminer's pick and shovel, which advanced at the rate of about ten yards\r\nper week, a machine known as the Beaumont boring machine will be brought\r\ninto requisition in the course of a day or two, and it is expected to\r\ncarry on the work at the rate of fifty yards per week, so that this year\r\nit may be possible to walk through the drainage heading from Liverpool\r\nto Birkenhead. The main tunnel works now in progress will probably be\r\ncompleted and trains running in the course of 18 months or two years.\r\n\r\nThe workmen are taken down the shaft by which the debris is hoisted, ten\r\nfeet in diameter, and when the visitor arrives at the bottom he finds\r\nhimself in quite a bright light, thanks to the Hammond electric light,\r\nworked by the Brush machine, which is now in use in the tunnel on both\r\nsides of the river. The depth of the pumping shaft is 170 feet, and the\r\nshaft communicates directly with the drainage heading. This circular\r\nheading now has been advanced about 737 yards. The heading is 7 feet in\r\ndiameter, and the amount of it under the river is upward of 200 yards on\r\neach side. The main tunnel, which is 26 feet wide and 21 feet high, has\r\nalso made considerable progress at both the Liverpool and Birkenhead\r\nends. From the Liverpool side the tunnel now extends over 430 yards, and\r\nfrom the opposite shore about 590 yards. This includes the underground\r\nstations, each of which is 400 feet long, 51 feet wide, and 32 feet\r\nhigh. Although the main tunnel has not made quite the same progress\r\nbetween the shafts as the drainage heading, it is only about 100 yards\r\nbehind it. When completed, the tunnel will be about a mile in length\r\nfrom shaft to shaft. In the course of the excavations which have been so\r\nfar carried out, about 70 cubic yards of rock have been turned out for\r\nevery yard forward.\r\n\r\nTen horses are employed on the Birkenhead side for drawing wagons loaded\r\nwith debris to the shaft, which, on being hoisted, is tipped into the\r\ncarts and taken for deposit to various places, some of which are about\r\nthree miles distant. The tunnel is lined throughout with very solid\r\nbrickwork, some of which is, 18 inches thick (composed of two layers\r\nof blue and two of red brick), and toward the river this brickwork is\r\nincreased to a thickness of six rings of bricks--three blue and three\r\nred. A layer of Portland cement of considerable thickness also gives\r\nincreased stability to the brick lining and other portions of the\r\ntunnel, and the whole of the flooring will be bricked. There are about\r\n22 yards of brickwork in every yard forward. The work of excavation up\r\nto the present time has been done by blasting (tonite being employed for\r\nthis purpose), and by the use of the pick and shovel. At every 45 ft.\r\non alternate sides niches of 18 in. depth are placed for the safety of\r\nplatelayers. The form of the tunnel is semicircular, the arch having a\r\n13 ft. radius, the side walls a 25 ft. radius, and the base a 40 ft.\r\nradius.\r\n\r\nFortunately not a single life has up to the present time been lost in\r\ncarrying out the exceedingly elaborate and gigantic work, and this\r\nimmunity from accident is largely owing to the care and skill which are\r\nmanifested by the heads of the various departments. The Mersey Tunnel\r\nscheme may now be looked upon as an accomplished work, and there is\r\nlittle doubt its value as a commercial medium will be speedily and fully\r\nappreciated upon completion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAM ACROSS THE OTTAWA RIVER AND NEW CANAL AT CARILLON QUE\r\n\r\nBy ANDREW BELL Resident Engineer\r\n\r\n\r\nThe natural navigation of the Ottawa River from the head of the Island\r\nof Montreal to Ottawa City--a distance of nearly a hundred miles--is\r\ninterrupted between the villages of Carillon and Grenville which are\r\nthirteen miles apart by three rapids, known as the Carillon, Chûte à\r\nBlondeau, and Longue Sault Rapids, which are in that order from east to\r\nwest. The Carillon Rapid is two miles long and has, or had, a fall of 10\r\nfeet the Chûte à Blondeau a quarter of a mile with a fall of 4 feet and\r\nthe Longue Sault six miles and a fall of 46 feet. Between the Carillon\r\nand Chûte à Blondeau there is or was a slack water reach of three and a\r\nhalf miles, and between the latter and the foot of the Longue Sault a\r\nsimilar reach of one and a quarter miles.\r\n\r\nSmall canals limited in capacity to the smaller locks on them which were\r\nonly 109 feet long 19 feet wide, and 5 to 6 feet of water on the sills,\r\nwere built by the Imperial Government as a military work around each of\r\nthe rapids. They were begun in 1819 and completed about 1832. They were\r\ntransferred to the Canadian Government in 1856. They are built on the\r\nnorth shore of the river, and each canal is about the length of the\r\nrapid it surmounts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT DAM ACROSS THE OTTAWA RIVER, AT CARILLON.]\r\n\r\nThe Grenville Canal (around the Longue Sault) with seven locks, and the\r\nChûte à Blondeau with one lock, are fed directly from Ottawa. But with\r\nthe Carillon that method was not followed as the nature of the banks\r\nthere would have in doing so, entailed an immense amount of rock\r\nexcavation--a serious matter in those days. The difficulty was overcome\r\nby locking up at the upper or western end 13 feet and down 23 at lower\r\nend, supplying the summit by a 'feeder from a small stream called the\r\nNorth River, which empties into the Ottawa three or four miles below\r\nCarillon, but is close to the main river opposite the canal.\r\n\r\nIn 1870-71 the Government of Canada determined to enlarge these canals\r\nto admit of the passage of boats requiring locks 200 feet long, 45 feet\r\nwide, and not less than 9 feet of water on the sills at the lowest\r\nwater. In the case of the Grenville Canal this was and is being done by\r\nwidening and deepening the old channel and building new locks along\r\nside of the old ones. But to do that with the Carillon was found to be\r\ninexpedient. The rapidly increasing traffic required more water than the\r\nNorth River could supply in any case, and the clearing up of the country\r\nto the north had materially reduced its waters in summer and fall, when\r\nmost needed. To deepen the old canal so as to enable it to take its\r\nsupply from the Ottawa would have caused the excavation of at least\r\n1,250,000 cubic yards of rock, besides necessitating the enlargement of\r\nthe Chûte à Blondeau also.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore decided to adopt a modification of the plan proposed\r\nby Mr. T.C. Clarke, of the present firm of Clarke Reeves & Co, several\r\nyears before when he made the preliminary surveys for the then proposed\r\n\"Ottawa Ship Canal,\" namely to build a dam across the river in the\r\nCarillon Rapid but of a sufficient height to drown out the Chûte à\r\nBlondeau, and also to give the required depth of water there.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer and fall of 1872 the writer made the necessary surveys\r\nof the river with that end in view. By gauging the river carefully in\r\nhigh and low water, and making use of the records which had been kept by\r\nthe lock masters for twenty years back, it was found that the flow of\r\nthe river was in extreme low water 26,000 cubic feet per second, and\r\nin highest water 190,000 cubic feet per second, in average years about\r\n30,000 and 150,000 cubic feet respectively. The average flow in each\r\nyear would be nearly a mean between those quantities, namely, about\r\n90,000 cubic feet per second. It was decided to locate the dam where it\r\nis now built, namely, about the center of Carillon Rapid, and a mile\r\nabove the village of that name and to make it of a height sufficient to\r\nraise the reach between the head of Carillon and Chûte à Blondeau about\r\nsix feet, and that above the latter two feet in ordinary water. At the\r\nsite chosen the river is 1,800 feet wide, the bed is solid limestone,\r\nand more level or flat than is generally found in such places--the banks\r\nhigh enough and also composed of limestone. It was also determined to\r\nbuild a slide for the passage of timber near the south shore (see map),\r\nand to locate the new canal on the north side.\r\n\r\nContracts for the whole works were given out in the spring of 1873, but\r\nas the water remained high all the summer of that year very little could\r\nbe done in it at the dam. In 1874 a large portion of the foundation,\r\nespecially in the shallow water, was put in. 1875 and 1876 proved\r\nunfavorable and not much could be done, when the works were stopped.\r\nThey were resumed in 1879, and the dam as also the slide successfully\r\ncompleted, with the exception of graveling of the dam in the fall of\r\n1881. The water was lower that summer than it had been for thirty five\r\nyears before. The canal was completed and opened for navigation the\r\nfollowing spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAM\r\n\r\nIn building such a dam as this the difficulties to be contended against\r\nwere unusually great. It was required to make it as near perfectly tight\r\nas possible and be, of course, always submerged. Allowing for water used\r\nby canal and slide and the leakage there should be a depth on the crest\r\nof the dam in low water of 2.50 feet and in high of about 10 feet.\r\nThese depths turned out ultimately to be correct. The river reaches\r\nits highest about the middle of May, and its lowest in September. It\r\ngenerally begins to rise again in November. Nothing could be done except\r\nduring the short low water season, and some years nothing at all. Even\r\nat the most favorable time the amount of water to be controlled was\r\nlarge. Then the depth at the site varied in depth from 2 to 14 feet, and\r\nat one place was as much as 23 feet. The current was at the rate of from\r\n10 to 12 miles an hour. Therefore, failures, losses, etc., could not be\r\navoided, and a great deal had to be learned as the work progressed. I\r\nam not aware that a dam of the kind was ever built, or attempted to be\r\nbuilt across a river having such a large flow as the Ottawa.\r\n\r\nThe method of construction was as follows. Temporary structures of\r\nvarious kinds suited to position, time, etc., were first placed\r\nimmediately above the site of the dam to break the current. This was\r\ndone in sections and the permanent dam proceeded with under that\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nIn shallow water timber sills 36 feet long and 12 inches by 12 inches\r\nwere bolted to the lock up and down stream, having their tops a uniform\r\nheight, namely, 9.30 feet below the top of dam when finished. These\r\nsills were, where the rock was high enough, scribed immediately to it,\r\nbut if not, they were 'made up' by other timbers scribed to the rock, as\r\nshown by Figs 4 and 5. They were generally placed in pairs about 6 feet\r\napart, and each alternate space left open for the passage of water, to\r\nbe closed by gates as hereafter described. Each sill was fastened by\r\nfive 1½ in. bolts driven into pine plugs forced into holes drilled\r\nfrom 18 inches to 24 inches into the rock. The temporary rock was then\r\nremoved as far as possible, to allow a free flow of the water.\r\n\r\nIn the channels of which there are three, having an aggregate width of\r\nabout 650 feet, cribs 46 feet wide up and down stream were sunk. In the\r\ndeepest water, where the rock was uneven, they covered the whole bottom\r\nup to about five feet of the level of the silts, and on top of that\r\nisolated cribs, 46 in. X 6 in. and of the necessary height were placed\r\nseven feet apart, as shown at C Figs 2 and 3. At other places similar\r\nnarrow cribs were placed on the rock, as shown at D, Figs 2 and 3. The\r\ntops of all were brought to about the same level as the before mentioned\r\nsills. The rock bottom was cleaned by divers of all bowlders, gravel,\r\netc. The cribs were built in the usual manner, of 12 in. X 12 in. timber\r\ngenerally hemlock, and carefully fitted to the rock on which they stand.\r\nThey were fastened to the rock by 1½ in. bolts, five on each side of a\r\ncrib, driven into pine plugs as mentioned for the sills. The drilling\r\nwas done by long runners from their tops. The upstream side of the cribs\r\nwere sheeted with 4 in. tamarack plank.\r\n\r\nOn top of these sills and cribs there was then placed all across river a\r\nplatform from 36 to 46 feet wide made up of sawed pine timber 12 in.\r\nX 12 in., each piece being securely bolted to its neighbor and to the\r\nsills and cribs below. It was also at intervals bolted through to the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nOn top of the \"platform\" there was next built a flat dam of the\r\nsectional form shown by Fig 1. It was built of 12 in. X 12 in. sawed\r\npine timbers securely bolted at the crossings and to the platform, and\r\nsheeted all over with tamarack 10 in. thick and the crest covered with\r\n½ in. boiler plate 3 ft. wide. The whole structure was carefully filled\r\nwith stone--field stone, or \"hard head\" generally being used for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the works, namely, in the fall of 1881 the structure\r\npresented somewhat the appearance of a bridge with short spans. The\r\nwhole river--fortunately low--flowed through the sluices of which there\r\nwere 113 and also through a bulkhead which had been left alongside\r\nof the slide with a water width of 60 ft. These openings had a total\r\nsectional area of 4,400 sq. ft., and barely allowed the river to pass,\r\nalthough, of course, somewhat assisted by leakage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. CROSS SECTION IN DEEP WATER.]\r\n\r\nIt now only remained, to complete the dam, to close the openings. This\r\nwas done in a manner that can be readily understood by reference to\r\nthe cuts. Gates had been constructed with timber 10 in. thick, bolted\r\ntogether. They were hung on strong wooden hinges and, before being\r\nclosed, laid back on the face of dam as shown at B, Figs. 1, 2, and 3.\r\nThey were all closed in a short time on the afternoon of 9th November,\r\n1881. To do this it was simply necessary to turn them over, when the\r\nstrong current through the sluices carried them into their places, as\r\nshown at A, Figs. 2 and 3 and by the dotted lines on Fig. 1. The closing\r\nwas a delicate as well as dangerous operation, but was as successfully\r\ndone as could be expected. No accident happened further than the\r\ndisplacement of two or three of the gates. The openings thus left\r\nwere afterward filled up with timber and brushwood. The large opening\r\nalongside of the slide was filled up by a crib built above and floated\r\ninto place.\r\n\r\nThe design contemplates the filling up with stone and gravel on\r\nup-stream side of dam about the triangular space that would be formed by\r\nthe production of the line of face of flat dam till it struck the rock.\r\nPart of that was done from the ice last winter; the balance is being put\r\nin this winter.\r\n\r\nObservations last summer showed that the calculations as to the raising\r\nof the surface of the river were correct. When the depth on the crest\r\nwas 2.50 feet, the water at the foot of the Longue Sault was found to be\r\n25 in. higher than if no dam existed. The intention was to raise it 24\r\nin.\r\n\r\nThe timber slide was formed by binding parallel piers about 600 feet\r\nlong up and down stream, as shown on the map, and 28 ft. apart, with a\r\ntimber bottom, the top of which at upper end is 3 ft. below the crest\r\nof dam. It has the necessary stop logs, with machinery to move them, to\r\ncontrol the water. The approach is formed by detached piers, connected\r\nby guide booms, extending about half a mile up stream. See map.\r\n\r\nAlongside of the south side of the slide a large bulkhead was built, 69\r\nft. wide, with a clear waterway of 60 ft. It was furnished with stop\r\nlogs and machinery to handle them. When not further required, it was\r\nfilled up by a crib as before mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the materials used in the dam and slide, and\r\nthe cost:\r\n\r\n  ______________________________________________________________________\r\n                   |         |         |  Stone   |  Exca-  |          |\r\n                   | Timber, |  Iron,  | filling, | vation, |   Cost.  |\r\n                   | cu. ft. |   lb.   | cu. yds. | cu. yds.|          |\r\n                   +---------+---------+----------+---------+----------+\r\n   Temporary works | 134,500 |  92,000 |  11,400  |         |  $79,000 |\r\n                   |         |         |          |         |          |\r\n    Permanent dam  | 265,000 | 439,600 |  24,000  |  6,500  |  151,000 |\r\n                   |         |         |          |         |          |\r\n  Slide, including | 296,500 | 156,400 |  32,800  |         |  102,000 |\r\n         apparatus |         |         |          |         |          |\r\n                   +---------+---------+----------+---------+----------+\r\n                   |         |         |          |         |          |\r\n            Total  | 696,000 | 687,000 |  68,200  |  6,500  | $332,000 |\r\n  -----------------+---------+---------+----------+---------+----------+\r\n\r\nThe above does not include cost of surveys, engineering, or\r\nsuperintendence, which amounted to about ten per cent, of the above sum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DETAILS OF THE OTTAWA RIVER DAM, AT CARILLON.]\r\n\r\nThe construction of the dam and slide was ably superintended by Horace\r\nMerrill, Esq., late superintendent of the \"Ottawa River Improvements,\"\r\nwho has built nearly all the slides and other works on the Ottawa to\r\nfacilitate the passage of its immense timber productions.\r\n\r\nThe contractors were the well known firm of F.B. McNamee & Co., of\r\nMontreal, and the successful completion of the work was in a large\r\ndegree due to the energy displayed by the working member of that\r\nfirm--Mr. A.G. Nish, formerly engineer of the Montreal harbor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CANAL\r\n\r\nThe canal was formed by \"fencing in\" a portion of the river-bed by an\r\nembankment built about a hundred feet out from the north shore and\r\ndeepening the intervening space where necessary. There are two\r\nlocks--one placed a little above the foot of the rapid (see map), and\r\nthe other at the end of the dam. Wooden piers are built at the upper and\r\nlower ends--the former being 800 ft. long, and the latter 300 ft; both\r\nare about 29 ft. high and 35 ft. wide.\r\n\r\nThe embankment is built, as shown by the cross section, Fig. 6. On the\r\ncanal side of it there is a wall of rubble masonry F, laid in hydraulic\r\ncement, connecting the two locks, and backed by a puddle wall, E, three\r\nfeet thick; next the river there is crib work, G, from ten to twenty\r\nfeet wide and the space between brick-work and puddle filled with earth.\r\nThe outer slope is protected with riprap, composed of large bowlders.\r\nThis had to be made very strong to prevent the destruction of the bank\r\nby the immense masses of moving ice in spring.\r\n\r\nThe distance between the locks is 3,300 feet.\r\n\r\nIn building the embankment the crib-work was first put in and followed\r\nby a part (in width) of the earth-bank. From that to the shore temporary\r\ncross-dams were built at convenient distances apart and the space pumped\r\nout by sections, when the necessary excavation was done, and the walls\r\nand embankments completed. The earth was put down in layers of not more\r\nthan a foot deep at a time, so that the bank, when completed, was solid.\r\nThe water at site of it varied in depth from 15 feet at lower end to 2\r\nfeet at upper.\r\n\r\nThe locks are 200 ft. long in the clear between the gates, and 45 ft\r\nwide in the chamber at the bottom. The walls of the lower one are 29 ft.\r\nhigh, and of the upper one 31 ft They are from 10 to 12 ft thick at the\r\nbottom,\r\n\r\nThe locks are built similar to those on the new Lachine and Welland\r\ncanals, of the very best cut stone masonry, laid in hydraulic cement.\r\nThe gates are 24 in. thick, made of solid timber, somewhat similar to\r\nthose in use on the St. Lawrence canals. They are suspended from anchors\r\nat the hollow quoins, and work very easily. The miter sills are made of\r\n26 in. square oak. The bottom of the lower lock iis timbered throughout,\r\nbut the upper one only at the recesses, the rock there being good.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE OTTAWA RIVER AT CARILLON RAPIDS.\r\n\r\nSECTION OF RIVER AT DAM. NOTE.--THE LOWEST DOTTED LINE IS LOW WATER\r\nBEFORETHE DAM WAS BUILT. THEN THE LINE OF HIGH WATER WAS ABOUT A FOOT\r\nABOVE WHAT IS CREST OF DAM NOW.]\r\n\r\nThe rise to be overcome by the two locks is 16 ft., but except in medium\r\nwater, is not equally distributed. In high water nearly the whole lift\r\nis on the upper lock, and in low water the lower one. In the very lowest\r\nknown stage of the river there will never be less than 9 ft. on the\r\nmiter sills.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this article, four locks were required\r\non the old military canal to accomplish what is now done by two.\r\n\r\nThe canal was opened in May, 1882, and has been a great success, the\r\nonly drawback--although slight--being that in high water the current for\r\nabout three-quarters of a mile above the upper pier, and at what was\r\nformerly the Chute a Biondeau, is rather strong. These difficulties can\r\nbe easily overcome--the former by building an embankment from the pier\r\nto Brophy's Island, the latter by removing some of the natural dam of\r\nrock which once formed the \"Chute.\"\r\n\r\nThe following are, in round numbers, the quantities of the principal\r\nmaterials used:\r\n\r\n  Earth and puddle in embankment ...cub. yds. 148,500\r\n  Rock excavation,                     \"       38,000\r\n  Riprap,                              \"        6,600\r\n  Lock masonry                         \"       14,200\r\n  Rubble masonry,                      \"       16,600\r\n  Timber in cribs, lock bottoms and gates \"   368,000\r\n  Wrought and cast iron, lb ................. 173,000\r\n  Stone filling cu yds ......................  45,300\r\n  Concrete        \"                               830\r\n\r\nThe total cost to date has been about $570,000, not including surveys,\r\nengineering, etc.\r\n\r\nThe contractors for the canal, locks, etc., were Messrs. R. P. Cooke &\r\nCo., of Brockville, Ont., who have built some large works in the States,\r\nand who are now engaged building other extensive works for the Canadian\r\nGovernment. The work here reflects great credit on their skill.\r\n\r\nOn the enlarged Grenville Canal, now approaching completion, there\r\nare five locks, taking the place of the seven small ones built by the\r\nImperial Government. It will be open for navigation all through in the\r\nspring of 1884, when steamers somewhat larger than the largest now\r\nnavigating the St. Lawrence between Montreal and Hamilton can pass up to\r\nOttawa City.--_Engineering News_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDWELLING HOUSES--HINTS ON BUILDING--\"HOME, SWEET HOME.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From a paper read before the Birmingham Architectural\r\nAssociation, Jan 30, 1883]\r\n\r\nBy WILLIAM HENMAN, A.R.I.B.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy intention is to bring to your notice some of the many causes which\r\nresult in unhealthy dwellings, particularly those of the middle classes\r\nof society. The same defects, it is true, are to be found in the palace\r\nand the mansion, and also in the artisan's cottage; but in the former\r\ncost is not so much a matter of consideration, and in the latter, the\r\nrequirements and appliances being less, the evils are minimized. It is\r\nin the houses of the middle classes, I mean those of a rental at from\r\n£50 to £150 per annum, that the evils of careless building and want\r\nof sanitary precautions become most apparent. Until recently sanitary\r\nscience was but little studied, and many things were done a few years\r\nsince which even the self-interest of a speculative builder would not do\r\nnowadays, nor would be permitted to do by the local sanitary authority.\r\nYet houses built in those times are still inhabited, and in many cases\r\nsickness and even death are the result. But it is with shame I must\r\nconfess that, notwithstanding the advance which sanitary science has\r\nmade, and the excellent appliances to be obtained, many a house is now\r\nbuilt, not only by the speculative builder, but designed by professed\r\narchitects, and in spite of sanitary authorities and their by-laws,\r\nwhich, in important particulars are far from perfect, are unhealthy, and\r\ncannot be truly called sweet homes.\r\n\r\nArchitects and builders have much to contend with. The perverseness of\r\nman and the powers of nature at times appear to combine for the express\r\npurpose of frustrating their endeavors to attain sanitary perfection.\r\nSuccessfully to combat these opposing forces, two things are above all\r\nnecessary, viz 1, a more perfect insight into the laws of nature, and a\r\njudicious use of serviceable appliances on the part of the architect;\r\nand, 2, greater knowledge, care, and trustworthiness on the part of\r\nworkmen employed. With the first there will be less of that blind\r\nfollowing of what has been done before by others, and by the latter the\r\narchitect who has carefully thought out the details of his sanitary work\r\nwill be enabled to have his ideas carried out in an intelligent manner.\r\nSeveral cases have come under my notice, where, by reckless carelessness\r\nor dense ignorance on the part of workmen, dwellings which might have\r\nbeen sweet and comfortable if the architect's ideas and instructions had\r\nbeen carried out, were in course of time proved to be in an unsanitary\r\ncondition. The defects, having been covered up out sight, were only made\r\nknown in some cases after illness or death had attacked members of the\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\nIn order that we may have thoroughly sweet homes, we must consider the\r\nlocalities in which they are to be situated, and the soil on which they\r\nare to rest. It is an admitted fact that certain localities are more\r\ngenerally healthy than others, yet circumstances often beyond their\r\ncontrol compel men to live in those less healthy. Something may, in\r\nthe course of time, be done to improve such districts by planting,\r\nsubdrainage, and the like. Then, as regards the soil; our earth has\r\nbeen in existence many an age, generation after generation has come and\r\npassed away, leaving behind accumulations of matter on its surface, both\r\nanimal and vegetable, and although natural causes are ever at the work\r\nof purification, there is no doubt such accumulations are in many cases\r\nhighly injurious to health, not only in a general way, but particularly\r\nif around, and worse still, under our dwellings. However healthy a\r\ndistrict is considered to be, it is never safe to leave the top soil\r\ninclosed within the walls of our houses; and in many cases the subsoil\r\nshould be covered with a layer of cement concrete, and at times with\r\nasphalt on the concrete. For if the subsoil be damp, moisture will rise;\r\nif it be porous, offensive matter may percolate through. It is my belief\r\nthat much of the cold dampness felt in so many houses is caused by\r\nmoisture rising from the ground inclosed _within_ the outer walls.\r\nCellars are in many cases abominations. Up the cellar steps is a\r\nfavorite means of entrance for sickness and death. Light and air, which\r\nare so essential for health and life, are shut out. If cellars are\r\nnecessary, they should be constructed with damp proof walls and floors;\r\nlight should be freely admitted; every part must be well ventilated,\r\nand, above all, no drain of any description should be taken in. If they\r\nbe constructed so that water cannot find its way through either walls or\r\nfloors, where is the necessity of a drain? Surely the floors can be\r\nkept clean by the use of so small an amount of water that it would be\r\nridiculous specially to provide a drain.\r\n\r\nThe next important but oft neglected precaution is to have a good damp\r\ncourse over the _whole_ of the walls, internal as well as external. I\r\nknow that for the sake of saving a few pounds (most likely that they may\r\nbe frittered away in senseless, showy features) it often happens, that\r\nif even a damp course is provided in the outer walls, it is dispensed\r\nwith in the interior walls. This can only be done with impunity on\r\nreally dry ground, but in too many cases damp finds its way up, and, to\r\nsay the least, disfigures the walls. Here I would pause to ask: What is\r\nthe primary reason for building houses? I would answer that, in this\r\ncountry at least, it is in order to protect ourselves from wind and\r\nweather. After going to great expense and trouble to exclude cold and\r\nwet by means of walls and roofs, should we not take as much pains to\r\nprevent them using from below and attacking us in a more insidious\r\nmanner? Various materials may be used as damp courses. Glazed\r\nearthenware perforated slabs are perhaps the best, when expense is no\r\nobject. I generally employ a course of slates, breaking joint with a\r\ngood bed of cement above and below; it answers well, and is not very\r\nexpensive. If the ground is irregular, a layer of asphalt is more easily\r\napplied. Gas tar and sand are sometimes used, but it deteriorates and\r\ncannot be depended upon for any length of time. The damp course should\r\ninvariably be placed _above_ the level of the ground around the\r\nbuilding, and _below_ the ground floor joists. If a basement story is\r\nnecessary, the outer walls below the ground should be either built\r\nhollow, or coated externally with some substance through which wet\r\ncannot penetrate. Above the damp course, the walls of our houses must\r\nbe constructed of materials which will keep out wind and weather. Very\r\nporous materials should be avoided, because, even if the wet does not\r\nactually find its way through, so much is absorbed during rainy weather\r\nthat in the process of drying much cold is produced by evaporation. The\r\nfact should be constantly remembered, viz., that evaporation causes\r\ncold. It can easily be proved by dropping a little ether upon the bulb\r\nof a thermometer, when it will be seen how quickly the mercury falls,\r\nand the same effect takes place in a less degree by the evaporation of\r\nwater. Seeing, then, that evaporation from so small a surface can\r\nlower temperature so many degrees, consider what must be the effect of\r\nevaporation from the extensive surfaces of walls inclosing our houses.\r\nThis experiment (thermometer with bulb inclosed in linen) enables me as\r\nwell to illustrate that curious law of nature which necessitates the\r\nintroduction of a damp course in the walls of our buildings; it is known\r\nas capillary or molecular attraction, and breaks through that more\r\npowerful law of gravitation, which in a general way compels fluids to\r\nfind their own level. You will notice that the piece of linen over the\r\nbulb of the thermometer, having been first moistened, continues moist,\r\nalthough only its lower end is in water, the latter being drawn up by\r\ncapillary attraction; or we have here an illustration more to the point:\r\na brick which simply stands with its lower end in water, and you can\r\nplainly see how the damp has risen.\r\n\r\nFrom these illustrations you will see how necessary it is that the brick\r\nand stone used for outer walls should be as far as possible impervious\r\nto wet; but more than that, it is necessary the jointing should be\r\nnon-absorbent, and the less porous the stone or brick, the better able\r\nmust the jointing be to keep out wet, for this reason, that when rain is\r\nbeating against a wall, it either runs down or becomes absorbed. If both\r\nbrick and mortar, or stone and mortar be porous, it becomes absorbed; if\r\nall are non-porous, it runs down until it finds a projection, and then\r\ndrops off; but if the brick or stone is non-porous, and the mortar\r\nporous, the wet runs down the brick or stone until it arrives at the\r\njoint, and is then sucked inward. It being almost impossible to obtain\r\nmaterials quite waterproof, suitable for external walls, other means\r\nmust be employed for keeping our homes dry and comfortable. Well built\r\nhollow walls are good. Stone walls, unless very thick, should be lined\r\nwith brick, a cavity being left between. A material called Hygeian Rock\r\nBuilding Composition has lately been introduced, which will, I believe,\r\nbe found of great utility, and, if properly applied, should insure a dry\r\nhouse. A cavity of one-half an inch is left between the outer and inner\r\nportion of the wall, whether of brick or stone, which, as the building\r\nrises, is run in with the material made liquid by heat; and not only is\r\nthe wall waterproofed thereby, but also greatly strengthened. It may\r\nalso be used as a damp course.\r\n\r\nGood, dry walls are of little use without good roofs, and for a\r\ncomfortable house the roofs should not only be watertight and\r\nweathertight, but also, if I may use the term, heat-tight. There can be\r\nno doubt that many houses are cold and chilly, in consequence of the\r\nrapid radiation of heat through the thin roofs, if not through thin and\r\nbadly constructed walls. Under both tiles and slates, but particularly\r\nunder the latter, there should be some non-conducting substance, such\r\nas boarding, or felt, or pugging. Then, in cold weather heat will be\r\nretained; in hot weather it will be excluded. Roofs should be of a\r\nsuitable pitch, so that neither rain nor snow can find its way in in\r\nwindy weather. Great care must be taken in laying gutters and flats.\r\nWith them it is important that the boarding should be well laid in\r\nnarrow widths, and in the direction of the fall; otherwise the boards\r\ncockle and form ridges and furrows in which wet will rest, and in time\r\ndecay the metal.\r\n\r\nAfter having secured a sound waterproof roof, proper provision must be\r\nmade for conveying therefrom the water which of necessity falls on it in\r\nthe form of rain. All eaves spouting should be of ample size, and the\r\nrain water down pipes should be placed at frequent intervals and of\r\nsuitable diameter. The outlets from the eaves spouting should not be\r\ncontracted, although it is advisable to cover them with a wire grating\r\nto prevent their becoming choked with dead leaves, otherwise the water\r\nwill overflow and probably find its way through the walls. All joints\r\nto the eaves spouting, and particularly to the rain-water down pipes,\r\nshould be made watertight, or there is great danger, when they are\r\nconnected with the soil drains, that sewer gas will escape at the joints\r\nand find its way into the house at windows and doors. There should be a\r\nsiphon trap at the bottom of each down pipe, unless it is employed as a\r\nventilator to the drains, and then the greatest care should be exercised\r\nto insure perfect jointings, and that the outlet be well above all\r\nwindows. Eaves spouting and rain-water down pipes should be periodically\r\nexamined and cleaned out. They ought to be painted inside as well as\r\nout, or else they will quickly decay, and if of iron they will rust,\r\nflake off, and become stopped.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to have a sweet home where there is continual dampness.\r\nBy its presence chemical action and decay are set up in many substances\r\nwhich would remain in a quiescent state so long as they continued dry.\r\nWood will rot; so will wall papers, the paste used in hanging them,\r\nand the size in distemper, however good they have been in the first\r\ninstance; then it is that injurious exhalations are thrown off, and the\r\nevil is doubtless very greatly increased if the materials are bad in\r\nthemselves. Quickly grown and sappy timber, sour paste, stale size, and\r\nwall papers containing injurious pigments are more easily attacked, and\r\nfar more likely to fill the house with bad smells and a subtile poison.\r\nPlaster to ceilings and walls is quickly damaged by wet, and if improper\r\nmaterials, such as road drift, be used in its composition, it may become\r\nmost unsavory and injurious to health. The materials for plaster cannot\r\nbe too carefully selected, for if organic matter be present, the result\r\nis the formation of nitrates and the like, which combine with lime and\r\nproduce deliquescent salts, viz, those which attract moisture. Then,\r\nhowever impervious to wet the walls, etc., may be, signs of dampness\r\nwill be noticed wherever there is a humid atmosphere, and similar evils\r\nwill result as if wet had penetrated from the exterior. Organic matter\r\ncoming into contact with plaster, and even the exhalations from human\r\nbeings and animals, will in time produce similar effects. Hence stables,\r\nwater closets, and rooms which are frequently crowded with people,\r\nunless always properly ventilated, will show signs of dampness and\r\ndeterioration of the plaster work; wall paper will become detached from\r\nthe walls, paint will blister and peel off, and distemper will lose its\r\nvirtue. To avoid similar mishaps, sea sand, or sand containing salt,\r\nshould never be used either for plaster or mortar. In fact, it is\r\nnecessary that the materials for mortar should be as free from salts and\r\norganic matter as those used for plaster, because the injurious effects\r\nof their presence will be quickly communicated to the latter.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it is not alone by taking precaution against the\r\npossibility of having a damp house that we necessarily insure a \"sweet\r\nhome.\" The watchful care of the architect is required from the cutting\r\nof the first sod until the finishing touches are put on the house. He\r\nmust assure himself that all is done, and nothing left undone which is\r\nlikely to cause a nuisance, or worse still, jeopardize the health of\r\nthe occupiers. Yet, with all his care and the employment of the best\r\nmaterials and apparatus at his command, complete success seems scarcely\r\npossible of attainment. We have all much to learn, many things must\r\nbe accomplished and difficulties overcome, ere we can \"rest and be\r\nthankful.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for the architect to attempt to solve all the problems\r\nwhich surround this question. He must in many cases employ such\r\nmaterials and such apparatus as can be obtained; nevertheless, it is his\r\nduty carefully to test the value of such materials and apparatus as\r\nmay be obtainable, and by his experience and scientific knowledge to\r\ndetermine which are best to be used under varying circumstances.\r\n\r\nBut to pass on to other matters which mar the sweetness of home. With\r\nmany, I hold that the method usually employed for warming our dwellings\r\nis wasteful, dirty, and often injurious to health. The open fire,\r\nalthough cheerful in appearance, is justly condemned. It is wasteful,\r\nbecause so small a percentage of the value of the fuel employed is\r\nutilized. It is dirty, because of the dust and soot which result\r\ntherefrom. It is unhealthy, because of the cold draughts which in its\r\nsimplest form are produced, and the stifling atmosphere which pervades\r\nthe house when the products of imperfect combustion insist, as they\r\noften do, in not ascending the flues constructed for the express purpose\r\nof carrying them off; and even when they take the desired course, they\r\nblacken and poison the external atmosphere with their presence. Some of\r\nthe grates known as ventilating grates dispose of one of the evils of\r\nthe ordinary open fire, by reducing the amount of cold draught caused by\r\nthe rush of air up the flues. This is effected, as you probably know, by\r\nadmitting air direct from the outside of the house to the back of the\r\ngrate, where it is warmed, and then flows into the rooms to supply the\r\nplace of that which is drawn up the chimneys. Provided such grates act\r\nproperly and are well put together, so that there is no possibility of\r\nsmoke being drawn into the fresh air channels, and that the air to\r\nbe warmed is drawn from a pure source, they may be used with much\r\nadvantage; although by them we must not suppose perfection has been\r\nattained. The utilization of a far greater percentage of heat and the\r\nconsumption of all smoke must be aimed at. It is a question if such can\r\nbe accomplished by means of an open fire, and it is a difficult matter\r\nto devise a method suited in every respect to the warming of our\r\ndwellings, which at the same time is equally cheering in appearance.\r\nSo long as we are obliged to employ coal in its crude form for heating\r\npurposes, and are content with the waste and dirt of the open fire, we\r\nmust be thankful for the cheer it gives in many a home where there are\r\nwell constructed grates and flues, and make the best use we can of the\r\nundoubted ventilating power it possesses.\r\n\r\nA constant change of air in every part of our dwellings is absolutely\r\nnecessary that we may have a \"sweet home,\" and the open fireplace with\r\nits flue materially helps to that end; but unless in every other respect\r\nthe house is in a good sanitary condition, the open fire only adds to\r\nthe danger of residing in such a house, because it draws the impure air\r\nfrom other parts into our living rooms, where it is respired. Closed\r\nstoves are useful in some places, such as entrance halls. They are more\r\neconomical than the open fireplaces; but with them there is danger of\r\nthe atmosphere, or rather, the minute particles of organic matter always\r\nfloating in the air, becoming burnt and so charging the atmosphere with\r\ncarbonic acid. The recently introduced slow-combustion stoves obviate\r\nthis evil.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to warm our houses without having separate fireplaces in\r\neach room, viz., by heated air, hot water, or steam; but there are\r\nmany difficulties and some dangers in connection therewith which I\r\ncan scarcely hope to see entirely overcome. In America steam has been\r\nemployed with some success, and there is this advantage in its use, that\r\nit can be conveyed a considerable distance. It is therefore possible\r\nto have the furnace and boilers for its production quite away from the\r\ndwelling houses and to heat several dwellings from one source, while at\r\nthe same time it can be employed for cooking purposes. In steam, then,\r\nwe have a useful agent, which might with advantage be more generally\r\nemployed; but when either it or hot water be used for heating purposes,\r\nspecial and adequate means of ventilation must be employed. Gas stoves\r\nare made in many forms, and in a few cases can be employed with\r\nadvantage; but I believe they are more expensive than a coal fire, and\r\nit is most difficult to prevent the products of combustion finding their\r\nway into the dwellings. Gas is a useful agent in the kitchen for cooking\r\npurposes, but I never remember entering a house where it was so employed\r\nwithout at once detecting the unpleasant smell resulting. It is rare to\r\nfind any special means for carrying off the injurious fumes, and without\r\nsuch I am sure gas cooking stoves cannot be healthy adjuncts to our\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nThe next difficulty we have to deal with is artificial lighting.\r\nWhether we employ candle, oil lamp, or gas, we may be certain that the\r\natmosphere of our rooms will become contaminated by the products of\r\ncombustion, and health must suffer. In order that such may be obviated,\r\nit must be an earnest hope that ere long such improvements will be made\r\nin electric lighting, that it may become generally used in our homes as\r\nwell as in all public buildings. Gas has certainly proved itself a very\r\nuseful and comparatively inexpensive illuminating power, but in many\r\nways it contaminates the atmosphere, is injurious to health, and\r\ndestructive to the furniture and fittings of our homes. Leakages from\r\nthe mains impregnate the soil with poisonous matter, and it rarely\r\nhappens that throughout a house there are no leakages. However small\r\nthey may be, the air becomes tainted. It is almost impossible, at times,\r\nto detect the fault, or if detected, to make good without great injury\r\nto other work, in consequence of the difficulty there is in getting at\r\nthe pipes, as they are generally embedded in plaster, etc. All gas pipes\r\nshould be laid in positions where they can be easily examined, and, if\r\nnecessary, repaired without much trouble. In France it is compulsory\r\nthat all gas pipes be left exposed to view, except where they must of\r\nnecessity pass through the thickness of a wall or floor, and it would be\r\na great benefit if such were required in this country.\r\n\r\nThe cooking processes which necessarily go on often result in unpleasant\r\nodors pervading our homes. I cannot say they are immediately prejudicial\r\nto health; but if they are of daily or frequent occurrence, it is more\r\nthan probable the volatile matters which are the cause of the odors\r\nbecome condensed upon walls, ceiling, or furniture, and in time undergo\r\nputrefaction, and so not only mar the sweetness of home, but in addition\r\naffect the health of the inmates. Cooking ranges should therefore be\r\nconstructed so as to carry off the fumes of cooking, and kitchens must\r\nbe well ventilated and so placed that the fumes cannot find their way\r\ninto other parts of the dwelling. In some houses washing day is an\r\nabomination. Steam and stife then permeate the building, and, to say the\r\nleast, banish sweetness and comfort from the home. It is a wonder that\r\npeople will, year after year, put up with such a nuisance.\r\n\r\nIf washing must be done home, the architect may do something to lessen\r\nthe evil by placing the washhouse in a suitable position disconnected\r\nfrom the living part of the house, or by properly ventilating it and\r\nproviding a well constructed boiler and furnace, and a flue for carrying\r\noff the steam.\r\n\r\nThere is daily a considerable amount of refuse found in every home, from\r\nthe kitchen, from the fire-grate, from the sweeping of rooms, etc., and\r\nas a rule this is day after day deposited in the ash-pit, which but\r\ntoo often is placed close to the house, and left uncovered. If it were\r\nsimply a receptacle for the ashes from the fire-grates, no harm would\r\nresult, but as all kinds of organic matter are cast in and often allowed\r\nto remain for weeks to rot and putrefy, it becomes a regular pest box,\r\nand to it often may be traced sickness and death. It would be a wise\r\nsanitary measure if every constructed ash pit were abolished. In place\r\nthereof I would substitute a galvanized iron covered receptacle of but\r\nmoderate size, mounted upon wheels, and it should be incumbent on the\r\nlocal authorities to empty same every two or three days. Where there are\r\ngardens all refuse is useful as manure, and a suitable place should be\r\nprovided for it at the greatest distance from the dwellings. Until the\r\nvery advisable reform I have just mentioned takes place, it would be\r\nwell if refuse were burnt as soon as possible. With care this may be\r\ndone in a close range, or even open fire without any unpleasant smells,\r\nand certainly without injury to health. It must be much more wholesome\r\nto dispose of organic matter in that way while fresh than to have it\r\nrotting and festering under our very noses.\r\n\r\nA greater evil yet is the privy. In the country, where there is no\r\ncomplete system of drainage, it may be tolerated when placed at a\r\ndistance from the house; but in a crowded neighborhood it is an\r\nabomination, and, unless frequently emptied and kept scrupulously clean,\r\ncannot fail to be injurious to health. Where there is no system of\r\ndrainage, cesspools must at times be used, but they should be avoided as\r\nmuch as possible. They should never be constructed near to dwellings,\r\nand must always be well ventilated. Care should be taken to make them\r\nwatertight, otherwise the foul matter may percolate through the ground,\r\nand is likely to contaminate the water supply. In some old houses\r\ncesspools have been found actually under the living rooms.\r\n\r\nI would here also condemn the placing of r. w. tanks under any portion\r\nof the dwelling house, for many cases of sickness and death have been\r\ntraced to the fact of sewage having found its way through, either by\r\nbacking up the drains, or by the ignorant laying of new into old\r\ndrains. Earth closets, if carefully attended to, often emptied, and the\r\nreceptacles cleaned out, can be safely employed even within doors;\r\nbut in towns it is difficult to dispose of the refuse, and there must\r\nnecessarily be a system of drainage for the purpose of taking off the\r\nsurface water; it is thereupon found more economical to carry away all\r\ndrainage together, and the water closet being but little trouble, and,\r\nif properly looked after, more cleanly in appearance, it is generally\r\npreferred, notwithstanding the great risks which are daily run in\r\nconsequence of the chance of sewer-gas finding an entrance into the\r\nhouse by its means. After all, it is scarcely fair to condemn outright\r\nthe water closet as the cause of so many of the ills to which flesh is\r\nsubject. It is true that many w. c. apparatus are obviously defective\r\nin construction, and any architect or builder using such is to be\r\ncondemned. The old pan closet, for instance, should be banished. It is\r\nknown to be defective, and yet I see it is still made, sold, and fixed,\r\nin dwelling houses, notwithstanding the fact that other closet pans far\r\nmore simple and effective can be obtained at less cost. The pan of the\r\ncloset should be large, and ought to retain a layer of water at the\r\nbottom, which, with the refuse, should be swept out of the pan by the\r\nrush of water from the service pipe. The outlet may be at the side\r\nconnected with a simple earthenware s-trap with a ventilating outlet at\r\nthe top, from which a pipe may be taken just through the wall. From the\r\nS-trap I prefer to take the soil pipe immediately through the wall, and\r\nconnect with a strong 4 in. iron pipe, carefully jointed, watertight,\r\nand continued of the same size to above the tops of all windows. This\r\npipe at its foot should be connected with a ventilating trap, so that\r\nall air connection is cut off between the house and the drains. All\r\nfunnel-shaped w. c. pans are objectionable, because they are so liable\r\nto catch and retain the dirt.\r\n\r\nWastes from baths, sinks, and urinals should also be ventilated and\r\ndisconnected from the drains as above, or else allowed to discharge\r\nabove a gulley trap. Excrement, etc., must be quickly removed from the\r\npremises if we are to have \"sweet homes,\" and the w.c. is perhaps the\r\nmost convenient apparatus, when properly constructed, which can be\r\nemployed. By taking due precaution no harm need be feared, or will\r\nresult from its use, provided that the drains and sewers are rightly\r\nconstructed and properly laid. It is then to the sewers, drains, and\r\ntheir connections our attention must be specially directed, for in the\r\nmajority of cases they are the arch-offenders. The laying of main sewers\r\nhas in most cases been intrusted to the civil engineer, yet it often\r\nhappens architects are blamed, and unjustly so, for the defective\r\nwork over which they had no control. When the main sewers are badly\r\nconstructed, and, as a result, sewer gas is generated and allowed to\r\naccumulate, ordinary precautions may be useless in preventing its\r\nentrance by some means or other to our homes, and special means and\r\nextra precautions must be adopted. But with well constructed and\r\nproperly ventilated sewers, every architect and builder should be able\r\nto devise a suitable system of house drainage, which need cause no\r\nfear of danger to health. The glazed stoneware pipe, now made of any\r\nconvenient size and shape, is an excellent article with which to\r\nconstruct house-drains. The pipes should be selected, well burnt, well\r\nglazed, and free from twist. Too much care cannot be exercised in\r\nproperly laying them. The trenches should be got out to proper falls,\r\nand unless the ground is hard and firm, the pipes should be laid upon a\r\nlayer of concrete to prevent the chance of sinking. The jointing must be\r\ncarefully made, and should be of cement or of well tempered clay, care\r\nbeing taken to wipe away all projecting portions from the inside of the\r\npipes. A clear passage-way is of the utmost importance. Foul drains are\r\nthe result of badly joined and irregularly laid pipes, wherein matter\r\naccumulates, which in time ferments and produces sewer-gas. The common\r\nsystem of laying drains with curved angles is not so good as laying them\r\nin straight lines from point to point, and at every angle inserting\r\na man-hole or lamp-hole, This plan is now insisted upon by the Local\r\nGovernment Board for all public buildings erected under their authority.\r\nIt might, with advantage, be adopted for all house-drains.\r\n\r\nNow, in consequence of the trouble and expense attending the opening up\r\nand examination of a drain, it may often happen that although defects\r\nare suspected or even known to exist, they are not remedied until\r\nillness or death is the result of neglect. But with drains laid in\r\nstraight lines, from point to point, with man holes or lamp holes at the\r\nintersections, there is no reason why the whole system may not easily be\r\nexamined at any time and stoppages quickly removed. The man holes and\r\nlamp-holes may, with advantage, be used as means for ventilating the\r\ndrains and also for flushing them. It is of importance that each house\r\ndrain should have a disconnecting trap just before it enters the main\r\nsewer. It is bad enough to be poisoned by neglecting the drainage to\r\none's own property, but what if the poison be developed elsewhere, and\r\nby neglect permitted to find its way to us. Such will surely happen\r\nunless some effective means be employed for cutting off all air\r\nconnection between the house-drains and the main sewer. I am firmly\r\nconvinced that simply a smoky chimney, or the discovery of a fault in\r\ndrainage weighs far more, in the estimation of a client in forming his\r\nopinion of the ability of an architect, than the successful carrying out\r\nof an artistic design. By no means do I disparage a striving to attain\r\nartistic effectiveness, but to the study of the artistic, in domestic\r\narchitecture at least, add a knowledge of sanitary science, and foster a\r\nhabit of careful observation of causes and effects. Comfort is demanded\r\nin the home, and that cannot be secured unless dwellings are built and\r\nmaintained with perfect sanitary arrangements and appliances.--_The\r\nBuilding News_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSE AT HEATON\r\n\r\n\r\nThis house, which belongs to Mr J.

Guerout in _La Lurmière Electrique_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAn endeavor has often been made to carry the origin of the electric\r\ntelegraph back to a very remote epoch by a reliance on those more or\r\nless fanciful descriptions of modes of communication based upon the\r\nproperties of the magnet.\r\n\r\nIt will prove not without interest before entering into the real history\r\nof the telegraph to pass in review the various documents that relate to\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nIn continuation of the 21st chapter of his _Magia naturalis_, published\r\nin 1553, J. B. Porta cites an experiment that had been made with the\r\nmagnet as a means of telegraphing. In 1616, Famiano Strada, in his\r\n_Prolusiones Academicæ_, takes up this idea, and speaks of the\r\npossibility of two persons communicating by the aid of two magnetized\r\nneedles influenced by each other at a distance. Galileo, in _Dialogo\r\nintorno_, written between 1621 and 1632 and Nicolas Caboeus, of Ferrara,\r\nin his _Philosophia magnetica_, both reproduce analogous descriptions,\r\nnot however without raising doubts as to the possibility of such a\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nA document of the same kind, to which great importance has been attached\r\nis found in the _Recreations mathematiques_ published at Rouen in 1628,\r\nunder the pseudonym of Van Elten, and reprinted several times since,\r\nwith the annotations and additions of Mydorge and Hamion and which must,\r\nit appears, be attributed to the Jesuit Leurechon. In his chapter on the\r\nmagnet and the needles that are rubbed therewith, we find the following\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n\"Some have pretended that, by means of a magnet or other like stone,\r\nabsent persons might speak with one another. For example, Claude being\r\nat Paris, and John at Rome, if each had a needle that had been rubbed\r\nwith some stone, and whose virtue was such that in measure as one needle\r\nmoved at Paris the other would move just the same at Rome, and if Claude\r\nand John each had an alphabet, and had agreed that they would converse\r\nwith each other every afternoon at 6 o'clock, and the needle having made\r\nthree and a half revolutions as a signal that Claude, and no other,\r\nwished to speak to John, then Claude wishing to say to him that the king\r\nis at Paris would cause his needle to move, and stop at T, then at H,\r\nthen at E, then at K, I, N, G and so on. Now, at the same time, John's\r\nneedle, according with Claude's, would begin to move and then stop at\r\nthe same letters, and consequently it would be easily able to write or\r\nunderstand what the other desired to signify to it. The invention is\r\nbeautiful, but I do not think there can be found in the world a magnet\r\nthat has such a virtue. Neither is the thing expedient, for treason\r\nwould be too frequent and too covert.\"\r\n\r\nThe same idea was also indicated by Joseph Glanville in his _Scepsis\r\nscientifica_, which appeared in 1665, by Father Le Brun, in his\r\n_Histoire critique des pratiques superstitieuses_, and finally by the\r\nAbbé Barthelemy in 1788.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion offered by Father Kircher, in his _Magnes sive de arte\r\nmagnetica_, is a little different from the preceding. The celebrated\r\nJesuit father seeks however, to do nothing more than to effect a\r\ncommunication of thoughts between two rooms in the same building. He\r\nplaces, at short distances from each other, two spherical vessels\r\ncarrying on their circumference the letters of the alphabet, and each\r\nhaving suspended within it, from a vertical wire a magnetized figure. If\r\none of these latter he moved, all the others must follow its motions,\r\none after the other, and transmission will thus be effected from the\r\nfirst vessel to the last. Father Kircher observes that it is necessary\r\nthat all the magnets shall be of the same strength, and that there shall\r\nbe a large number of them, which is something not within the reach\r\nof everybody. This is why he points out another mode of transmitting\r\nthought, and one which consists in supporting the figures upon vertical\r\nrevolving cylinders set in motion by one and the same cord hidden with\r\nin the walls.\r\n\r\nThere is no need of very thoroughly examining all such systems of\r\nmagnetic telegraphy to understand that it was never possible for them to\r\nhave a practical reality, and that they were pure speculations which it\r\nis erroneous to consider as the first ideas of the electric telegraph.\r\n\r\nWe shall make a like reserve with regard to certain apparatus that\r\nhave really existed, but that have been wrongly viewed as electric\r\ntelegraphs. Such are those of Comus and of Alexandre. The first of these\r\nis indicated in a letter from Diderot to Mlle. Voland, dated July 12,\r\n1762. It consisted of two dials whose hands followed each other at a\r\ndistance, without the apparent aid of any external agent. The fact\r\nthat Comus published some interesting researches on electricity in the\r\n_Journal de Physique_ has been taken as a basis for the assertion that\r\nhis apparatus was a sort of electrical discharge telegraph in which the\r\ncommunication between the two dials was made by insulated wires hidden\r\nin the walls. But, if it be reflected how difficult it would have been\r\nat that epoch to realize an apparatus of this kind, if it be remembered\r\nthat Comus, despite his researches on electricity, was in reality only a\r\nprofessor of physics to amuse, and if the fact be recalled that cabinets\r\nof physics in those days were filled with ingenious apparatus in which\r\nthe surprising effects were produced by skillfully concealed magnets, we\r\nshall rather be led to class among such apparatus the so-called \"Comus\r\nelectric telegraph.\"\r\n\r\nWe find, moreover, in Guyot's _Recreations physiques et\r\nmathematiques_--a work whose first edition dates back to the time at\r\nwhich Comus was exhibiting his apparatus--a description of certain\r\ncommunicating dials that seem to be no other than those of the\r\ncelebrated physicist, and which at all events enables us to understand\r\nhow they worked.\r\n\r\nLet one imagine to himself two contiguous chambers behind which ran\r\none and the same corridor. In each chamber, against the partition that\r\nseparated it from the corridor, there was a small bracket, and upon the\r\nlatter, and very near the wall, there was a wooden dial supported on a\r\nstandard, but in no wise permanently fixed upon the bracket. Each dial\r\ncarried a needle, and each circumference was inscribed with twenty-five\r\nletters of the alphabet. The experiment that was performed with these\r\ndials consisted in placing the needle upon a letter in one of the\r\nchambers, when the needle of the other dial stopped at the same letter,\r\nthus making it possible to transmit words and even sentences. As for the\r\nmeans of communication between the two apparatus, that was very simple:\r\nOne of the two dials always served as a transmitter, and the other as a\r\nreceiver. The needle of the transmitter carried along in its motion\r\na pretty powerful magnet, which was concealed in the dial, and which\r\nreacted through the partition upon a very light magnetized needle that\r\nfollowed its motions, and indicated upon an auxiliary dial, to a person\r\nhidden in the corridor, the letter on which the first needle had been\r\nplaced. This person at once stepped over to the partition corresponding\r\nto the receiver, where another auxiliary dial permitted him to properly\r\ndirect at a distance the very movable needle of the receiver. Everything\r\ndepended, as will be seen, upon the use of the magnet, and upon a deceit\r\nthat perfectly accorded with Comus' profession. There is, then, little\r\nthought in our opinion that if the latter's apparatus was not exactly\r\nthe one Guyot describes, it was based upon some analogous artifice.\r\n\r\nJean Alexandre's telegraph appears to have borne much analogy with\r\nComus'. Its inventor operated it in 1802 before the prefect of\r\nIndre-et-Loire. As a consequence of a report addressed by the prefect of\r\nVienne to Chaptal, and in which, moreover, the apparatus in question was\r\ncompared to Comus', Alexandre was ordered to Paris. There he refused to\r\nexplain upon what principle his invention was based, and declared that\r\nhe would confide his secret only to the First Consul. But Bonaparte,\r\nlittle disposed to occupy himself with such an affair, charged Delambre\r\nto examine it and address a report to him. The illustrious astronomer,\r\ndespite the persistence with which Alexandre refused to give up his\r\nsecret to him, drew a report, the few following extracts from which\r\nwill, we think, suffice to edify the reader:\r\n\r\n\"The pieces that the First Consul charged me to examine did not contain\r\nenough of detail to justify an opinion. Citizen Beauvais (friend and\r\nassociate of Alexandre) knows the inventor's secret, but has promised\r\nhim to communicate it to no one except the First Consul. This\r\ncircumstance might enable me to dispense with any report; for how judge\r\nof a machine that one has not seen and does not know the agent of? All\r\nthat is known is that the _telegraphe intime_ consists of two like\r\nboxes, each carrying a dial on whose circumference are marked the\r\nletters of the alphabet. By means of a winch, the needle of one dial is\r\ncarried to all the letters that one has need to use, and at the same\r\ninstant the needle of the second box repeats, in the same order, all the\r\nmotions and indications of the first.\r\n\r\n\"When these two boxes are placed in two separate apartments, two persons\r\ncan write to and answer one another, without seeing or being seen by one\r\nanother, and without any one suspecting their correspondence. Neither\r\nnight nor fog can prevent the transmission of a dispatch.... The\r\ninventor has made two experiments--one at Portiers and the other at\r\nTours--in the presence of the prefects and mayors, and the record shows\r\nthat they were fully successful. To-day, the inventor and his associate\r\nask that the First Consul be pleased to permit one of the boxes to be\r\nplaced in his apartment and the other at the house of Consul Cambaceres\r\nin order to give the experiment all the _éclat_ and authenticity\r\npossible; or that the First Consul accord a ten minutes' interview to\r\ncitizen Beauvais, who will communicate to him the secret, which is\r\nso easy that the simple _expose_ of it would be equivalent to a\r\ndemonstration, and would take the place of an experiment.... If, as one\r\nmight be tempted to believe from a comparison with a bell arrangement,\r\nthe means adopted by the inventor consisted in wheels, movements,\r\nand transmitting pieces, the invention would be none the less\r\nastonishing.... If, on the contrary, as the Portier's account seems to\r\nprove, the means of communication is a fluid, there would be the more\r\nmerit in his having mastered it to such a point as to produce so regular\r\nand so infallible effects at such distances.... But citizen Beauvais\r\n... desires principally to have the First Consul as a witness and\r\nappreciator.... It is to be desired, then, that the First Consul shall\r\nconsent to hear him, and that he may find in the communication that will\r\nbe made to him reasons for giving the invention a good reception and for\r\nproperly rewarding the inventor.\"\r\n\r\nBut Bonaparte remained deaf, and Alexandre persisted in his silence, and\r\ndied at Angers, in 1832, in great poverty, without having revealed his\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nAs, in 1802, Volta's pile was already invented, several authors have\r\nsupposed an application of it in Alexandre's apparatus. \"Is it not\r\nallowable to believe,\" exclaims one of these, \"that the electric\r\ntelegraph was at that time discovered?\" We do not hesitate to respond in\r\nthe negative. The pile had been invented for too short a time, and too\r\nlittle was then known of the properties of the current, to allow a\r\nman so destitute of scientific knowledge to so quickly invent all the\r\nelectrical parts necessary for the synchronic operation of the two\r\nneedles. In this _telegraphe intime_ we can only see an apparatus\r\nanalogous to the one described by Guyot, or rather a synchronism\r\nobtained by means of cords, as in Kircher's arrangement. The fact that\r\nAlexandre's two dials were placed on two different stories, and distant,\r\nhorizontally, fifteen meters, in nowise excludes this latter mode of\r\ntransmission. On another hand, the mystery in which Alexandre was\r\nshrouded, his declaration relative to the use of a fluid, and the\r\nassurance with which he promised to reveal his secret to the First\r\nConsul, prove absolutely nothing, for too often have the most profoundly\r\nignorant people--the electric girl, for example--befooled learned bodies\r\nby the aid of the grossest frauds. From the standpoint of the history\r\nof the electric telegraph, there is no value, then, to be attributed to\r\nthis apparatus of Alexandre, any more than there is to that of Comus or\r\nto _any_ of the dreams based upon the properties of the magnet.\r\n\r\nThe history of the electric telegraph really begins with 1753, the date\r\nat which is found the first indication of a telegraph truly based upon\r\nthe use of electricity. This telegraph is described in a letter written\r\nby Renfrew, dated Feb. 1, 1753, and signed with the initials \"C.M.,\"\r\nwhich, in all probability, were those of a savant of the time--Charles\r\nMarshall. A few extracts from this letter will give an idea of the\r\nprecision with which the author described his invention:\r\n\r\n\"Let us suppose a bundle of wires, in number equal to that of the\r\nletters of the alphabet, stretched horizontally between two given\r\nplaces, parallel with each other and distant from each other one inch.\r\n\r\n\"Let us admit that after every twenty yards the wires are connected to a\r\nsolid body by a juncture of glass or jeweler's cement, so as to prevent\r\ntheir coming in contact with the earth or any conducting body, and so\r\nas to help them to carry their own weight. The electric battery will be\r\nplaced at right angles to one of the extremities of the wires, and the\r\nbundle of wires at each extremity will be carried by a solid piece of\r\nglass. The portions of the wires that run from the glass support to the\r\nmachine have sufficient elasticity and stiffness to return to their\r\nprimitive position after having been brought into contact with the\r\nbattery. Very near to this same glass support, on the opposite side,\r\nthere descends a ball suspended from each wire, and at a sixth or a\r\ntenth of an inch beneath each ball there is placed one of the letters of\r\nthe alphabet written upon small pieces of paper or other substance light\r\nenough to be attracted and raised by the electrified ball. Besides this,\r\nall necessary arrangements are taken so that each of these little papers\r\nshall resume its place when the ball ceases to attract.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--LESAGE'S TELEGRAPH.]\r\n\r\n\"All being arranged as above, and the minute at which the correspondence\r\nis to begin having been fixed upon beforehand, I begin the conversation\r\nwith my friend at a distance in this way: I set the electric machine\r\nin motion, and, if the word that I wish to transcribe is 'Sir,' for\r\nexample, I take, with a glass rod, or with any other body electric\r\nthrough itself or insulating, the different ends of the wires\r\ncorresponding to the three letters that compose the word. Then I press\r\nthem in such a way as to put them in contact with the battery. At the\r\nsame instant, my correspondent sees these different letters carried in\r\nthe same order toward the electrified balls at the other extremity of\r\nthe wires. I continue to thus spell the words as long as I judge proper,\r\nand my correspondent, that he may not forget them, writes down the\r\nletters in measure as they rise. He then unites them and reads the\r\ndispatch as often as he pleases. At a given signal, or when I desire it,\r\nI stop the machine, and, taking a pen, write down what my friend sends\r\nme from the other end of the line.\"\r\n\r\nThe author of this letter points out, besides, the possibility of\r\nkeeping, in the first place, all the springs in contact with the\r\nbattery, and, consequently, all the letters attracted, and of indicating\r\neach letter by removing its wire from the battery, and consequently\r\nmaking it fall. He even proposed to substitute bells of different sounds\r\nfor the balls, and to produce electric sparks upon them. The sound\r\nproduced by the spark would vary according to the bell, and the letters\r\nmight thus be heard.\r\n\r\nNothing, however, in this document authorizes the belief that Charles\r\nMarshall ever realized his idea, so we must proceed to 1774 to find\r\nLesage, of Geneva, constructing a telegraph that was based upon the\r\nprinciple indicated twenty years before in the letter of Renfrew.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus that Lesage devised (Fig. 1) was composed of 24 wires\r\ninsulated from one another by a non conducting material. Each of these\r\nwires corresponded to a small pith ball suspended by a thread. On\r\nputting an electric machine in communication with such or such a one of\r\nthese wires, the ball of the corresponding electrometer was repelled,\r\nand the motion signaled the letter that it was desired to transmit. Not\r\ncontent with having realized an electric telegraph upon a small scale,\r\nLesage thought of applying it to longer distances.\r\n\r\n\"Let us conceive,\" said he in a letter written June 22, 1782, to Mr.\r\nPrevost, of Geneva, \"a subterranean pipe of enameled clay, whose cavity\r\nat about every six feet is separated by partitions of the same material,\r\nor of glass, containing twenty-four apertures in order to give passage\r\nto as many brass wires as these diaphragms are to sustain and keep\r\nseparated. At each extremity of this pipe are twenty-four wires that\r\ndeviate from one another horizontally, and that are arranged like the\r\nkeys of a clavichord; and, above this row of wire ends, are distinctly\r\ntraced the twenty-four letters of the alphabet, while beneath there is a\r\ntable covered with twenty-four small pieces of gold-leaf or other easily\r\nattractable and quite visible bodies.\"\r\n\r\nLesage had thought of offering his secret to Frederick the Great; but\r\nhe did not do so, however, and his telegraph remained in the state of a\r\ncurious cabinet experiment. He had, nevertheless, opened the way, and,\r\ndating from that epoch, we meet with a certain number of attempts at\r\nelectrostatic telegraphy. [1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Advantage has been taken of a letter from Alexander Volta\r\nto Prof. Barletti (dated 1777), indicating the possibility of firing his\r\nelectric pistol from a great distance, to attribute to him a part in the\r\ninvention of the telegraph. We have not shared in this opinion, which\r\nappears to us erroneous, since Volta, while indicating the possibility\r\nabove stated, does not speak of applying such a fact to telegraphy.]\r\n\r\nThe first in date is that of Lemond, which is spoken of by Arthur Young\r\n(October 16, 1787), in his _Voyage Agronomique en France_:\r\n\r\n\"In the evening,\" says he, \"we are going to Mr. Lemond's, a very\r\ningenious mechanician, and one who has a genius for invention.... He has\r\nmade a remarkable discovery in electricity. You write two or three words\r\nupon paper; he takes them with him into a room and revolves a machine\r\nwithin a sheath at the top of which there is an electrometer--a pretty\r\nlittle ball of feather pith. A brass wire is joined to a similar\r\ncylinder, and electrified in a distant apartment, and his wife on\r\nremarking the motions of the ball that corresponds, writes down the\r\nwords that they indicate; from whence it appears that he has formed an\r\nalphabet of motions. As the length of the wire makes no difference in\r\nthe effect, a correspondence might be kept up from very far off, for\r\nexample with a besieged city, or for objects much more worthy of\r\nattention. Whatever be the use that shall be made of it, the discovery\r\nis an admirable one.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, Lemond's telegraph was of the most interesting character,\r\nfor it was a single wire one, and we already find here an alphabet based\r\nupon the combination of a few elementary signals.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus that next succeeds is the electric telegraph that Reveroni\r\nSaint Cyr proposed in 1790, to announce lottery numbers, but as to the\r\nconstruction of which we have no details. In 1794 Reusser, a German,\r\nmade a proposition a little different from the preceding systems, and\r\nwhich is contained in the _Magazin für das Neueste aus der Physik und\r\nNaturgeschichte_, published by Henri Voigt.\r\n\r\n\"I am at home,\" says Reusser, \"before my electric machine, and I am\r\ndictating to some one on the other side of the street a complete\r\nletter that he is writing himself. On an ordinary table there is fixed\r\nvertically a square board in which is inserted a pane of glass. To this\r\nglass are glued strips of tinfoil cut out in such a way that the spark\r\nshall be visible. Each strip is designated by a letter of the alphabet,\r\nand from each of them starts a long wire. These wires are inclosed in\r\nglass tubes which pass underground and run to the place whither the\r\ndispatch is to be transmitted. The extremities of the wires reach a\r\nsimilar plate of glass, which is likewise affixed to a table and\r\ncarries strips of tinfoil similar to the others. These strips are also\r\ndesignated, by the same letters, and are connected by a return wire with\r\nthe table of him who wishes to dictate the message. If, now, he who is\r\ndictating puts the external armature of a Leyden jar in contact with the\r\nreturn wire, and the ball of this jar in contact with a metallic rod\r\ntouching that of the tinfoil strip which corresponds with the letter\r\nwhich he wishes to dictate to the other, sparks will be produced upon\r\nthe nearest as well as upon the remotest strips, and the distant\r\ncorrespondent, seeing such sparks, may immediately write down the letter\r\nmarked. Will an extended application of this system ever be made? That\r\nis not the question; it is possible. It will be very expensive; but the\r\npost hordes from Saint Petersburg to Lisbon are also very expensive,\r\nand if any one should apply the idea on a large scale, I shall claim a\r\nrecompense.\"\r\n\r\nEvery letter, then, was signaled by one or several sparks that started\r\nforth on the breaking of the strip; but we see nothing in this document\r\nto authorize the opinion which has existed, that every tinfoil strip was\r\na sort of magic tablet upon which the sparks traced the very form of the\r\nletter to be transmitted.\r\n\r\nVoigt, the editor of the _Magazin_, adds, in continuation of Reusser's\r\ncommunication: \"Mr. Reusser should have proposed the addition to this\r\narrangement of a vessel filled with detonating gas which could be\r\nexploded in the first place, by means of the electric spark, in order\r\nto notify the one to whom something was to be dictated that he should\r\ndirect his attention to the strips of tinfoil.\"\r\n\r\nThis passage gives the first indication of the use of a special call for\r\nthe telegraph. The same year (1794), in a work entitled _Versuch über\r\nTelegraphie und Telegraphen_, Boeckmann likewise proposed the use of the\r\npistol as a call signal, in conjunction with the use of a line composed\r\nof two wires only, and of discharges in the air or a vacuum, grouped in\r\nsuch a way as to form an alphabet.\r\n\r\nExperiments like those indicated by Boeckmann, however, seem to have\r\nbeen made previous to 1794, or at that epoch, at least, by Cavallo,\r\nsince the latter describes them in a _Treatise on Electricity_ written\r\nin English, and a French translation of which was published in 1795.\r\nIn these experiments the length of the wires reached 250 English feet.\r\nCavallo likewise proposed to use as signals combustible or detonating\r\nmaterials, and to employ as a call the noise made by the discharge of a\r\nLeyden jar.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 occurred the experiments of Dr. Francisco Salva and of the\r\nInfante D. Antonio. The following is what we may read on this subject in\r\nthe _Journal des Sciences_:\r\n\r\n\"Prince de la Paix, having learned that Dr. Francisco Salva had read\r\nbefore the Royal Academy of Sciences of Barcelona a memoir on the\r\napplication of electricity to telegraphy, and that he had presented at\r\nthe same time an electric telegraph of his own invention, desired\r\nto examine this machine in person. Satisfied as to the accuracy and\r\ncelerity with which we can converse with another by means of it, he\r\nobtained for the inventor the honor of appearing before the king. Prince\r\nde la Paix, in the presence of their majesties and of several lords,\r\ncaused the telegraph to converse to the satisfaction of the whole court.\r\nThe telegraph conversed some days afterward at the residence of the\r\nInfante D. Antonio.\r\n\r\n\"His Highness expressed a desire to have a much completer one that\r\nshould have sufficient electrical power to communicate at great\r\ndistances on land and sea. The Infante therefore ordered the\r\nconstruction of an electric machine whose plate should be more than\r\nforty inches in diameter. With the aid of this machine His Highness\r\nintends to undertake a series of useful and curious experiments that he\r\nhas proposed to Dr. D. Salva.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1797 or '98 (some authors say 1787), the Frenchman, Betancourt, put\r\nup a line between Aranjuez and Madrid, and telegraphed through the\r\nmedium of discharges from a Leyden jar.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting of the telegraphs based upon the use of static\r\nelectricity is without doubt that of Francis Ronalds, described by the\r\nlatter, in 1823, in a pamphlet entitled _Descriptions of an Electrical\r\nTelegraph and of some other Electrical Apparatus_, but the construction\r\nof which dates back to 1816.\r\n\r\nWhat is peculiarly interesting in Ronalds' apparatus is that it presents\r\nfor the first time the use of two synchronous movements at the two\r\nstations in correspondence.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is represented in Fig. 2. It is based upon the\r\nsimultaneous working of two pith-ball electrometers, combined with the\r\nsynchronous running of two clock-work movements. At the two stations\r\nthere were identical clocks for whose second hand there had been\r\nsubstituted a cardboard disk (Fig. 3), divided into twenty sectors. Each\r\nof these latter contained one figure, one letter, and a conventional\r\nword. Before each movable disk there was a screen, A (Fig. 2),\r\ncontaining an aperture through which only one sector could, be seen at\r\na time. Finally, before each screen there was a pith-ball electrometer.\r\nThe two electrometers were connected together by means of a conductor\r\n(C) passing under the earth, and which at either of its extremities\r\ncould be put in communication with either an electric machine or the\r\nground. A lever handle, J, interposed into the circuit a Volta's pistol,\r\nF, that served as a call.\r\n\r\nWhen one of the operators desired to send a dispatch to the other he\r\nconnected the conductor with the machine, and, setting the latter in\r\noperation, discharged his correspondent's pistol as a signal. The call\r\neffected, the first operator continued to revolve the machine so that\r\nthe balls of pith should diverge in the two electrometers. At the same\r\ntime the two clocks were set running. When the sender saw the word\r\n\"attention\" pass before the slit in the screen he quickly discharged the\r\nline, the balls of the two electrometers approached each other, and, if\r\nthe two clocks agreed perfectly, the correspondent necessarily saw in\r\nthe aperture in his screen the same word, \"attention.\" If not, he moved\r\nthe screen in consequence, and the operation was performed over until\r\nhe could send, in his turn, the word \"ready.\" Afterward, the sender\r\ntransmitted in the same way one of the three words, \"letters,\"\r\n\"figures,\" \"dictionary,\" in order to indicate whether he wished to\r\ntransmit letters or figures, or whether the letters received, instead of\r\nbeing taken in their true sense, were to be referred to a conventional\r\nvocabulary got up in advance. It was after such preliminaries that the\r\nactual transmission of the dispatch was begun. The pith balls, which\r\nwere kept constantly apart, approached each other at the moment the\r\nletter to be transmitted passed before the aperture in the screen.\r\n\r\nRonalds, in his researches, busied himself most with the construction of\r\nlines. He put up on the grounds near his dwelling an air line 8 miles\r\nlong; and, to do so, stretched fine iron wire in zigzag fashion between\r\ntwo frames 18 meters apart. Each of these frames carried thirty-seven\r\nhooks, to which the wire was attached through the intermedium of silk\r\ncords. He laid, besides, a subterranean line of 525 feet at a depth of 4\r\nfeet. The wire was inclosed within thick glass tubes which were placed\r\nin a trough of dry wood, of 2 inch section, coated internally and\r\nexternally with pitch. This trough was, moreover, filled full of pitch\r\nand closed with a cover of wood. Ronalds preferred these subterranean\r\nconductors to air lines. A portion of one of them that was laid by him\r\nat Hammersmith figured at the Exhibition of 1881, and is shown in Fig.\r\n4.\r\n\r\nNearly at the epoch at which Ronalds was experimenting in England,\r\na certain Harrisson Gray Dyar was also occupying himself with\r\nelectrostatic telegraphy in America. According to letters published only\r\nin 1872 by American journals, Dyar constructed the first telegraph in\r\nAmerica. This line, which was put up on Long Island, was of iron wire\r\nstrung on poles carrying glass insulators, and, upon it, Dyar operated\r\nwith static electricity. Causing the spark to act upon a movable disk\r\ncovered with litmus paper, he produced by the discoloration of the\r\nlatter dots and dashes that formed an alphabet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nThese experiments, it seems, were so successful that Dyar and his\r\nrelatives resolved to construct a line from New York to Philadelphia;\r\nbut quarrels with his copartners, lawsuits, and other causes obliged him\r\nto leave for Rhode Island, and finally for France in 1831. He did not\r\nreturn to America till 1858.\r\n\r\nDyar, then, would seem to have been the first who combined an alphabet\r\ncomposed of dots and dashes. On this point, priority has been claimed by\r\nSwaim in a book that appeared at Philadelphia in 1829 under the title of\r\n_The Mural Diagraph_, and in a communication inserted in the _Comptes\r\nRendus_ of the Academic des Sciences for Nov. 27, 1865.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nIn 1828, likewise, Victor Triboaillet de Saint Amand proposed to\r\nconstruct a telegraph line between Paris and Brussels. This line was to\r\nbe a subterranean one, the wire being covered with gum shellac, then\r\nwith silk, and finally with resin, and being last of all placed in glass\r\ntubes. A strong battery was to act at a distance upon an electroscope,\r\nand the dispatches were to be transmitted by the aid of a conventional\r\nvocabulary based upon the number of the electroscope's motions.\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1844, Henry Highton took out a patent in England for a\r\ntelegraph working through electricity of high tension, with the use of\r\na single line wire. A paper unrolled regularly between two points, and\r\neach discharge made a small hole in it, But this hole was near one\r\nor the other of the points according as the line was positively or\r\nnegatively charged. The combination of the holes thus traced upon two\r\nparallel lines permitted of the formation of an alphabet. This telegraph\r\nwas tried successfully over a line ten miles long, on the London and\r\nNorthwestern Railway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nWe have followed electrostatic telegraphs up to an epoch at which\r\ntelegraphy had already entered upon a more practical road, and it now\r\nremains for us to retrace our steps toward those apparatus that are\r\nbased upon the use of the voltaic current.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProf. Dolbear observes that if a galvanometer is placed between the\r\nterminals of a circuit of homogeneous iron wire and heat is applied, no\r\nelectric effect will be observed; but if the structure of the wire\r\nis altered by alternate bending or twisting into a helix, then the\r\ngalvanometer will indicate a current. The professor employs a helix\r\nconnected with a battery, and surrounding a portion of the wire in\r\ncircuit with the galvanometer. The current in the helix magnetizes the\r\ncircuit wire inclosed, and the galvanometer exhibits the presence of\r\nelectricity. The experiment helps to prove that magnetism is connected\r\nwith some molecular change of the magnetized metal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: From a recent lecture in London before the Institute of Civil\r\nEngineers.]\r\n\r\nBy Dr. C. WILLIAM SIEMENS, F.R.S, Mem. Inst. C.E.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Siemens, in opening the discourse, adverted to the object the\r\nCouncil had in view in organizing these occasional lectures, which were\r\nnot to be lectures upon general topics, but the outcome of such special\r\nstudy and practical experience as members of the Institution had\r\nexceptional opportunities of acquiring in the course of their\r\nprofessional occupation. The subject to be dealt with during the present\r\nsession was that of electricity. Already telegraphy had been brought\r\nforward by Mr. W. H. Preece, and telephonic communication by Sir\r\nFrederick Bramwell.\r\n\r\nThus far electricity had been introduced as the swift and subtile agency\r\nby which signals were produced either by mechanical means or by the\r\nhuman voice, and flashed almost instantaneously to distances which were\r\nlimited, with regard to the former, by restrictions imposed by the\r\nglobe. To the speaker had been assigned the task of introducing to their\r\nnotice electric energy in a different aspect. Although still giving\r\nevidence of swiftness and precision, the effects he should dwell upon\r\nwere no longer such as could be perceived only through the most delicate\r\ninstruments human ingenuity could contrive, but were capable of rivaling\r\nthe steam engine, compressed air, and the hydraulic accumulator in the\r\naccomplishment of actual work.\r\n\r\nIn the early attempts at magneto electric machines, it was shown that,\r\nso long as their effect depended upon the oxidation of zinc in a\r\nbattery, no commercially useful results could have been anticipated. The\r\nthermo-battery, the discovery of Seebeck in 1822, was alluded to as a\r\nmeans of converting heat into electric energy in the most direct manner;\r\nbut this conversion could not be an entire one, because the second law\r\nof thermo-dynamics, which prevented the realization as mechanical force\r\nof more than one seventh part of the heat energy produced in combustion\r\nunder the boiler, applied equally to the thermo-electric battery, in\r\nwhich the heat, conducted from the hot points of juncture to the\r\ncold, constituted a formidable loss. The electromotive force of each\r\nthermo-electric element did not exceed 0.036 of a volt, and 1,800\r\nelements were therefore necessary to work an incandescence lamp.\r\n\r\nA most useful application of the thermo-electric battery for measuring\r\nradiant heat, the thermo pile, was exhibited. By means of an ingenious\r\nmodification of the electrical pyrometer, named the bolometer, valuable\r\nresearches in measuring solar radiations had been made by Professor\r\nLangley.\r\n\r\nFaraday's great discovery of magneto-induction was next noticed, and the\r\noriginal instrument by which he had elicited the first electric spark\r\nbefore the members of the Royal Institution in 1831, was shown in\r\noperation. It was proved that although the individual current produced\r\nby magnetoinduction was exceedingly small and momentary in action, it\r\nwas capable of unlimited multiplication by mechanical arrangements of a\r\nsimple kind, and that by such multiplication the powerful effects of the\r\ndynamo machine of the present day were built up. One of the means for\r\naccomplishing such multiplication was the Siemens armature of 1856.\r\nAnother step of importance was that involved in the Pacinotti ring,\r\nknown in its practical application as the machine of Gramme. A third\r\nstep, that of the self exciting principle, was first communicated by Dr.\r\nWerner Siemens to the Berlin Academy, on the 17th of January, 1867, and\r\nby the lecturer to the Royal Society, on the 4th of the following\r\nmonth. This was read on the 14th of February, when the late Sir Charles\r\nWheatstone also brought forward a paper embodying the same principle.\r\nThe lecturer's machine, which was then exhibited, and which might be\r\nlooked upon as the first of its kind, was shown in operation; it had\r\ndone useful work for many years as a means of exciting steel magnets.\r\nA suggestion contained in Sir Charles Wheatstone's paper, that \"a very\r\nremarkable increase of all the effects, accompanied by a diminution in\r\nthe resistance of the machine, is observed when a cross wire is placed\r\nso as to divert a great portion of the current from the electro-magnet,\"\r\nhad led the lecturer to an investigation read before the Royal Society\r\non the 4th of March, 1880, in which it was shown that by augmenting the\r\nresistance upon the electro-magnets 100 fold, valuable effects could be\r\nrealized, as illustrated graphically by means of a diagram. The most\r\nimportant of these results consisted in this, that the electromotive\r\nforce produced in a \"shunt-wound machine,\" as it was called, increased\r\nwith the external resistance, whereby the great fluctuations formerly\r\ninseparable from electric arc lighting could be obviated, and thus,\r\nby the double means of exciting the electro-magnets, still greater\r\nuniformity of current was attainable.\r\n\r\nThe conditions upon which the working of a well conceived dynamo machine\r\nmust depend were next alluded to, and it was demonstrated that when\r\nlosses by unnecessary wire resistance, by Foucault currents, and by\r\ninduced currents in the rotating armature were avoided, as much as 90\r\nper cent., or even more, of the power communicated to the machine was\r\nrealized in the form of electric energy, and that _vice versa_ the\r\nreconversion of electric into mechanical energy could be accomplished\r\nwith similarly small loss. Thus, by means of two machines at a moderate\r\ndistance apart, nearly 80 per cent, of the power imparted to one machine\r\ncould be again yielded in the mechanical form by the second, leaving\r\nout of consideration frictional losses, which latter need not be\r\ngreat, considering that a dynamo machine had only one moving part\r\nwell balanced, and was acted upon along its entire circumference by\r\npropelling force. Jacobi had proved, many years ago, that the maximum\r\nefficiency of a magneto-electric engine was obtained when\r\n\r\ne / E = w / W = ½\r\n\r\nwhich law had been frequently construed, by Verdet (Theorie Mecanique\r\nde la Chaleur) and others, to mean that one-half was the maximum\r\ntheoretical efficiency obtainable in electric transmission of power, and\r\nthat one half of the current must be necessarily wasted or turned into\r\nheat. The lecturer could never be reconciled to a law necessitating such\r\na waste of energy, and had maintained, without disputing the accuracy of\r\nJacobi's law, that it had reference really to the condition of maximum\r\nwork accomplished with a given machine, whereas its efficiency must be\r\ngoverned by the equation:\r\n\r\ne / E = w / W = nearly 1\r\n\r\nFrom this it followed that the maximum yield was obtained when two\r\ndynamo machines (of similar construction) rotated nearly at the same\r\nspeed, but that under these conditions the amount of force transmitted\r\nwas a minimum. Practically the best condition of working consisted in\r\ngiving to the primary machine such proportions as to produce a current\r\nof the same magnitude, but of 50 per cent, greater electromotive force\r\nthan the secondary; by adopting such an arrangement, as much as 50 per\r\ncent, of the power imparted to the primary could be practically received\r\nfrom the secondary machine at a distance of several miles. Professor\r\nSilvanus Thompson, in his recent Cantor Lectures, had shown an ingenious\r\ngraphical method of proving these important fundamental laws.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of transmitting power electrically was so obvious that\r\nsuggestions to that effect had been frequently made since the days of\r\nVolta, by Ritchie, Jacobi, Henry, Page, Hjorth, and others; but it\r\nwas only in recent years that such transmission had been rendered\r\npractically feasible.\r\n\r\nJust six years ago, when delivering his presidential address to the Iron\r\nand Steel Institute, the lecturer had ventured to suggest that \"time\r\nwill probably reveal to us effectual means of carrying power to great\r\ndistances, but I cannot refrain from alluding to one which is, in my\r\nopinion, worthy of consideration, namely, the electrical conductor.\r\nSuppose water power to be employed to give motion to a dynamo-electrical\r\nmachine, a very powerful electrical current will be the result, which\r\nmay be carried to a great distance, through a large metallic conductor,\r\nand then be made to impart motion to electromagnetic engines, to ignite\r\nthe carbon points of electric lamps, or to effect the separation of\r\nmetals from their combinations. A copper rod 3 in. in diameter would\r\nbe capable of transmitting 1,000 horse power a distance of say thirty\r\nmiles, an amount sufficient to supply one-quarter of a million candle\r\npower, which would suffice to illuminate a moderately-sized town.\" This\r\nsuggestion had been much criticised at the time, when it was still\r\nthought that electricity was incapable of being massed so as to deal\r\nwith many horse power of effect, and the size of conductor he had\r\nproposed was also considered wholly inadequate. It would be interesting\r\nto test this early calculation by recent experience. Mr. Marcel Deprez\r\nhad, it was well known, lately succeeded in transmitting as much as\r\nthree horse power to a distance of 40 kilometers (25 miles) through\r\na pair of ordinary telegraph wires of 4 millimeters in diameter. The\r\nresults so obtained had been carefully noted by Mr. Tresca, and had been\r\ncommunicated a fortnight ago to the French Academy of Sciences. Taking\r\nthe relative conductivity of iron wire employed by Deprez, and the 3\r\nin. rod proposed by the lecturer, the amount of power that could be\r\ntransmitted through the latter would be about 4,000 horse power. But\r\nDeprez had employed a motor-dynamo of 2,000 volts, and was contented\r\nwith a yield of 32 per cent. only of the energy imparted to the primary\r\nmachine, whereas he had calculated at the time upon an electromotive\r\nforce of 200 volts, and upon a return of at least 40 per cent. of the\r\nenergy imparted. In March, 1878, when delivering one of the Science\r\nLectures at Glasgow, he said that a 2 in. rod could be made to\r\naccomplish the object proposed, because he had by that time conceived\r\nthe possibility of employing a current of at least 500 volts. Sir\r\nWilliam Thomson had at once accepted these views, and with the\r\nconceptive ingenuity peculiar to himself, had gone far beyond him, in\r\nshowing before the Parliamentary Electric Light Committee of 1879, that\r\nthrough a copper wire of only ½ in. diameter, 21,000 horse power might\r\nbe conveyed to a distance of 300 miles with a current of an intensity\r\nof 80,000 volts. The time might come when such a current could be dealt\r\nwith, having a striking distance of about 12 ft. in air, but then,\r\nprobably, a very practical law enunciated by Sir William Thomson would\r\nbe infringed. This was to the effect that electricity was conveyed at\r\nthe cheapest rate through a conductor, the cost of which was such\r\nthat the annual interest upon the money expended equaled the annual\r\nexpenditure for lost effect in the conductor in producing the power to\r\nbe conveyed. It appeared that Mr. Deprez had not followed this law in\r\nmaking his recent installations.\r\n\r\nSir William Armstrong was probably first to take practical, advantage of\r\nthese suggestions in lighting his house at Cragside during night time,\r\nand working his lathe and saw bench during the day, by power transmitted\r\nthrough a wire from a waterfall nearly a mile distant from his mansion.\r\nThe lecturer had also accomplished the several objects of pumping water,\r\ncutting wood, hay, and swedes, of lighting his house, and of carrying on\r\nexperiments in electro-horticulture from a common center of steam power.\r\nThe results had been most satisfactory; the whole of the management\r\nhad been in the hands of a gardener and of laborers, who were without\r\nprevious knowledge of electricity, and the only repairs that had been\r\nfound necessary were one renewal of the commutators and an occasional\r\nchange of metallic contact brushes.\r\n\r\nAn interesting application of electric transmission to cranes, by Dr.\r\nHopkinson, was shown in operation.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous other applications of the electrical transmission\r\nof power, that to electrical railways, first exhibited by Dr. Werner\r\nSiemens, at the Berlin Exhibition of 1879, had created more than\r\nordinary public attention. In it the current produced by the dynamo\r\nmachine, fixed at a convenient station and driven by a steam engine\r\nor other motor, was conveyed to a dynamo placed upon the moving car,\r\nthrough a central rail supported upon insulating blocks of wood, the two\r\nworking rails serving to convey the return current. The line was 900\r\nyards long, of 2 ft gauge, and the moving car served its purpose of\r\ncarrying twenty visitors through the exhibition each trip. The success\r\nof this experiment soon led to the laying of the Lichterfelde line, in\r\nwhich both rails were placed upon insulating sleepers, so that the one\r\nserved for the conveyance of the current from the power station to the\r\nmoving car, and the other for completing the return circuit. This line\r\nhad a gauge of 3 ft. 3 in., was 2,500 yards in length, and was worked\r\nby two dynamo machines, developing an aggregate current of 9,000 watts,\r\nequal to 12 horse power. It had now been in constant operation since May\r\n16, 1881, and had never failed in accomplishing its daily traffic.\r\nA line half a kilometer in length, but of 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge was\r\nestablished by the lecturer at Paris in connection with the Electric\r\nExhibition of 1881. In this case, two suspended conductors in the form\r\nof hollow tubes with a longitudinal slit were adopted, the contact being\r\nmade by metallic bolts drawn through these slit tubes, and connected\r\nwith the dynamo machine on the moving car by copper ropes passing\r\nthrough the roof. On this line 95,000 passengers were conveyed within\r\nthe short period of seven weeks.\r\n\r\nAn electric tramway, six miles in length, had just been completed,\r\nconnecting Portrush with Bush Mills, in the north of Ireland, in the\r\ninstallation of which the lecturer was aided by Mr. Traill, as engineer\r\nof the company by Mr. Alexander Siemens, and by Dr. E. Hopkinson,\r\nrepresenting his firm. In this instance the two rails, 3 ft. apart, were\r\nnot insulated from the ground, but were joined electrically by means of\r\ncopper staples and formed the return circuit, the current being conveyed\r\nto the car through a T iron placed upon short standards, and insulated\r\nby means of insulate caps. For the present the power was produced by\r\na steam engine at Portrush, giving motion to a shunt-wound dynamo of\r\n15,000 watts=20 horse power, but arrangements were in progress to\r\nutilize a waterfall of ample power near Bush Mills, by means of three\r\nturbines of 40 horse power each, now in course of erection. The working\r\nspeed of this line was restricted by the Board of Trade to ten miles an\r\nhour, which was readily obtained, although the gradients of the line\r\nwere decidedly unfavorable, including an incline of two miles in length\r\nat a gradient of 1 in 38. It was intended to extend the line six miles\r\nbeyond Bush Mills, in order to join it at Dervock station with the north\r\nof Ireland narrow gauge railway system.\r\n\r\nThe electric system of propulsion was, in the lecturer's opinion,\r\nsufficiently advanced to assure practical success under suitable\r\ncircumstances--such as for suburban tramways, elevated lines, and\r\nabove all lines through tunnels; such as the Metropolitan and District\r\nRailways. The advantages were that the weight, of the engine, so\r\ndestructive of power and of the plant itself in starting and stopping,\r\nwould be saved, and that perfect immunity from products of combustion\r\nwould be insured The experience at Lichterfelde, at Paris, and another\r\nelectric line of 765 yards in length, and 2 ft. 2 in. gauge, worked\r\nin connection with the Zaukerode Colliery since October, 1882, were\r\nextremely favorable to this mode of propulsion. The lecturer however\r\ndid not advocate its prospective application in competition with the\r\nlocomotive engine for main lines of railway. For tramways within\r\npopulous districts, the insulated conductor involved a serious\r\ndifficulty. It would be more advantageous under these circumstances to\r\nresort to secondary batteries, forming a store of electrical energy\r\ncarried under the seats of the car itself, and working a dynamo machine\r\nconnected with the moving wheels by means of belts and chains.\r\n\r\nThe secondary battery was the only available means of propelling vessels\r\nby electrical power, and considering that these batteries might be made\r\nto serve the purpose of keel ballast, their weight, which was still\r\nconsiderable, would not be objectionable. The secondary battery was not\r\nan entirely new conception. The hydrogen gas battery suggested by Sir\r\nWm. Grove in 1841, and which was shown in operation, realized in the\r\nmost perfect manner the conception of storage, only that the power\r\nobtained from it was exceedingly slight. The lecturer, in working upon\r\nSir Wm. Grove's conception, had twenty-five years ago constructed\r\na battery of considerable power in substituting porous carbon for\r\nplatinum, impregnating the same with a precipitate of lead peroxidized\r\nby a charging current. At that time little practical importance attached\r\nhowever to the object, and even when Plante, in 1860, produced his\r\nsecondary battery, composed of lead plates peroxidized by a charging\r\ncurrent, little more than scientific curiosity was excited. It was\r\nonly since the dynamo machine had become an accomplished fact that\r\nthe importance of this mode of storing energy had become of practical\r\nimportance, and great credit was due to Faure, to Sellon, and to\r\nVolckmar for putting this valuable addition to practical science into\r\navailable forms. A question of great interest in connection with the\r\nsecondary battery had reference to its permanence. A fear had been\r\nexpressed by many that local action would soon destroy the fabric of\r\nwhich it was composed, and that the active surfaces would become coated\r\nwith sulphate of lead, preventing further action. It had, however,\r\nlately been proved in a paper read by Dr. Frankland before the Royal\r\nSociety, corroborated by simultaneous investigations by Dr. Gladstone\r\nand Mr. Tribe, that the action of the secondary battery depended\r\nessentially upon the alternative composition and decomposition of\r\nsulphate of lead, which was therefore not an enemy, but the best friend\r\nto its continued action.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the lecturer referred to electric nomenclature, and to\r\nthe means for measuring and recording the passage of electric energy.\r\nWhen he addressed the British Association at Southampton, he had\r\nventured to suggest two electrical units additional to those established\r\nat the Electrical Congress in 1881, viz.: the watt and the joule,\r\nin order to complete the chain of units connecting electrical with\r\nmechanical energy and with the unit quantity of heat. He was glad to\r\nfind that this suggestion had met with a favorable reception, especially\r\nthat of the watt, which was convenient for expressing in an intelligible\r\nmanner the effective power of a dynamo machine, and for giving a precise\r\nidea of the number of lights or effective power to be realized by its\r\ncurrent, as well as of the engine power necessary to drive it; 746 watts\r\nrepresented 1 horse-power.\r\n\r\nFinally, the watt meter, an instrument recently developed by his firm,\r\nwas shown in operation. This consisted simply of a coil of thick\r\nconductor suspended by a torsion wire, and opposed laterally to a fixed\r\ncoil of wire of high resistance. The current to be measured flowed\r\nthrough both coils in parallel circuit, the one representing its\r\nquantity expressible in amperes, and the other its potential expressible\r\nin volts. Their joint attractive action expressed therefore volt-amperes\r\nor watts, which were read off upon a scale of equal divisions.\r\n\r\nThe lecture was illustrated by experiments, and by numerous diagrams and\r\ntables of results. Measuring instruments by Professors Ayrton and Perry,\r\nby Mr. Edison and by Mr. Boys, were also exhibited.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE PREPARATION OF GELATINE PLATES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Being an abstract of the introductory lecture to a course on\r\nphotography at the Polytechnic Institute, November 11.]\r\n\r\nBy E. HOWARD FARMER, F.C.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the first announcement of these lectures, our Secretary has asked\r\nme to give a free introductory lecture, so that all who are interested\r\nin the subject may come and gather a better idea as to them than they\r\ncan possibly do by simply leading a prospectus. This evening, therefore,\r\nI propose to give first a typical lecture of the course, and secondly,\r\nat its conclusion, to say a few words as to our principal object. As the\r\nsubject for this evening's lecture I have chosen, \"The Preparation of\r\nGelatine Plates,\" as it is probably one of very general interest to\r\nphotographers.\r\n\r\nBefore preparing our emulsion, we must first decide upon the particular\r\nmaterials we are going to use, and of these the first requisite is\r\nnitrate of silver. Nitrate of silver is supplied by chemists in three\r\nprincipal conditions:\r\n\r\n1. The ordinary crystallized salt, prepared by dissolving silver in\r\nnitric acid, and evaporating the solution until the salt crystallizes\r\nout. This sample usually presents the appearance of imperfect crystals,\r\nhaving a faint yellowish tinge, and a strong odor of nitrous fumes, and\r\ncontains, as might be expected, a considerable amount of free acid.\r\n\r\n2. Fused nitrate, or \"lunar caustic,\" prepared by fusing the\r\ncrystallized salt and casting it into sticks. Lunar caustic is usually\r\nalkaline to test paper.\r\n\r\n3. Recrystallized silver nitrate, prepared by redissolving the ordinary\r\nsalt in distilled water, and again evaporating to the crystallizing\r\npoint. By this means the impurities and free acid are removed.\r\n\r\nI have a specimen of this on the table, and it consists, as you observe,\r\nof fine crystals which are perfectly colorless and transparent; it is\r\nalso perfectly neutral to test paper. No doubt either of these samples\r\ncan be used with success in preparing emulsions, but to those who are\r\ninexperienced, I recommend that the recrystallized salt be employed. We\r\nmake, then, a solution of recrystallized silver nitrate in distilled\r\nwater, containing in every 12 ounces of solution 1¼ ounces of the salt.\r\n\r\nThe next material we require is a soluble bromide. I have here specimens\r\nof various bromides which can be employed, such as ammonium, potassium,\r\nbarium, and zinc bromides; as a rule, however, either the ammonium or\r\npotassium salt is used, and I should like to say a few words respecting\r\nthe relative efficiency of these two salts.\r\n\r\n1. As to ammonium bromide. This substance is a highly unstable salt.\r\nA sample of ammonium bromide which is perfectly neutral when first\r\nprepared will, on keeping, be found to become decidedly acid in\r\ncharacter. Moreover, during this decomposition, the percentage of\r\nbromine does not remain constant; as a rule, it will be found to contain\r\nmore than the theoretical amount of bromine. Finally, all ammonium salts\r\nhave a most destructive action on gelatine; if gelatine, which has\r\nbeen boiled for a short time with either ammonium bromide or ammonium\r\nnitrate, be added to an emulsion, it will be found to produce pink\r\nfog--and probably frilling--on plates prepared with the emulsion. For\r\nthese reasons, I venture to say that ammonium bromide, which figures so\r\nlargely in formulæ for gelatine emulsions, is one of the worst bromides\r\nthat can be employed for that purpose, and is, indeed, a frequent source\r\nof pink fog and frilling.\r\n\r\n2. As to potassium bromide. This is a perfectly stable substance, can be\r\nreadily obtained pure, and is constant in composition; neither has it\r\n(nor the nitrate) any appreciable destructive action on gelatine. We\r\nprepare, then, a solution of potassium bromide in water containing in\r\nevery 12 ounces of solution 1 ounce of the salt. On testing it with\r\nlitmus paper, the solution may be either slightly alkaline or neutral;\r\nin either case, it should be faintly acidified with hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nThe last material we require is the gelatine, one of the most important,\r\nand at the same time the most difficult substance to obtain of good\r\nquality. I have various samples here--notably Nelson's No. 1 and \"X\r\nopaque;\" Coignet's gold medal; Heinrich's; the Autotype Company's; and\r\nRussian isinglass.\r\n\r\nThe only method I know of securing a uniform quality of gelatine is to\r\npurchase several small samples, make a trial emulsion with each, and buy\r\na stock of the sample which gives the best results. To those who do not\r\ncare to go to this trouble, equal quantities of Nelson's No. 1 and\r\nX opaque, as recommended by Captain Abney, can be employed. Having\r\nselected the gelatine, 1¼ ounces should be allowed to soak in water, and\r\nthen melted, when it will be found to have a bulk of about 6 ounces.\r\n\r\nIn order to prepare our emulsion, I take equal bulks of the silver\r\nnitrate and potassium bromide solutions in beakers, and place them in\r\nthe water bath to get hot. I also take an equal bulk of hot water in a\r\nlarge beaker, and add to it one-half an ounce of the gelatine solution\r\nto every 12 ounces of water. Having raised all these to about 180° F., I\r\nadd (as you observe) to the large beaker containing the dilute gelatine\r\na little of the bromide, then, through a funnel having a fine orifice,\r\na little of the silver, swirling the liquid round during the operation;\r\nthen again some bromide and silver, and so on until all is added.\r\n\r\nWhen this is completed, a little of the emulsion is poured on a glass\r\nplate, and examined by transmitted light; if the mixing be efficient,\r\nthe light will appear--as it does here--of an orange or orange red\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that we keep the bromide in excess while mixing. I\r\nmust not forget to mention that to those experienced in mixing, by\r\nfar the best method is that described by Captain Abney in his Cantor\r\nlectures, of keeping the silver in excess.\r\n\r\nThe emulsion, being properly mixed, has now to be placed in the water\r\nbath, and kept at the boiling point for forty-five minutes. As,\r\nobviously, I cannot keep you waiting while this is done, I propose to\r\ndivide our emulsion into two portions, allowing one portion to stew, and\r\nto proceed with the next operation with the remainder.\r\n\r\nSupposing, then, this emulsion has been boiled, it is placed in cold\r\nwater to cool. While it is cooling, let us consider for a moment what\r\ntakes place during the boiling. It is found that during this time the\r\nemulsion undergoes two remarkable changes:\r\n\r\n1. The molecules of silver bromide gradually aggregate together, forming\r\nlarger and larger particles.\r\n\r\n2. The emulsion increases rapidly in sensitiveness. Now what is the\r\ncause, in the first place, of this aggregation of molecules: and, in the\r\nsecond place, of the increase of sensitiveness? We know that the two\r\ninvariably go together, so that we are right in concluding that the same\r\ncause produces both.\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that heat is the cause, but the same changes take\r\nplace more slowly in the cold, so we can only say that heat accelerates\r\nthe action, and hence must conclude that the prime cause is one of the\r\nmaterials in the emulsion itself.\r\n\r\nNow, besides the silver bromide, we have in the emulsion water,\r\ngelatine, potassium nitrate, and a small excess of potassium bromide;\r\nand in order to find which of these is the cause, we must make different\r\nemulsions, omitting in succession each of these materials. Suppose we\r\ntake an emulsion which has just been mixed, and, instead of boiling\r\nit, we precipitate the gelatine and silver bromide with alcohol; on\r\nredissolving the pellicle in the same quantity of water, we have an\r\nemulsion the same as previously, with the exception that the niter and\r\nexcess of potassium bromide are absent. If such an emulsion be boiled,\r\nwe shall find the remarkable fact that, however long it be boiled, the\r\nsilver bromide undergoes no change, neither does the emulsion become\r\nany more sensitive. We therefore conclude, that either the niter or the\r\nsmall excess of potassium bromide, or both together, produce the change.\r\n\r\nNow take portions of a similarly washed emulsion, and add to one portion\r\nsome niter, and to another some potassium bromide; on boiling these\r\nwe find that the one containing niter does not change, while that\r\ncontaining the potassium bromide rapidly undergoes the changes\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nHere, then, by a direct appeal to experiment, we prove that to all\r\nappearance comparatively useless excess of potassium bromide is really\r\none of the most important constituents of the emulsion.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives some interesting results respecting this\r\naction of potassium bromide:\r\n\r\n  __________________________________________________________\r\n  Excess of potash bromide. |   Time to acquire maximum    |\r\n                            |       sensitiveness.         |\r\n  --------------------------+------------------------------+\r\n   0.2 grain per ounce      | no increase after six hours. |\r\n   2.0   \"      \"           | about one-half an hour.      |\r\n  20.0   \"      \"           | seven minutes.               |\r\n  --------------------------+------------------------------+\r\n\r\nI must here leave the _rationale_ of the process for the present, and\r\nproceed with the next operation.\r\n\r\nOur emulsion being cold, I add to it, for every 6 ounces of mixed\r\nemulsion, 1 ounce of a saturated cold solution of potassium bichromate;\r\nthen, gently swirling the mixture round, a few drops of a dilute (1 to\r\n8) solution of hydrochloric acid, and place it on one side for a minute\r\nor two.\r\n\r\nWhen hydrochloric acid is added to bichromate of potash, chromic acid is\r\nliberated. Now, chromic acid has the property of precipitating gelatine,\r\nso that what I hope to have done is to have precipitated the gelatine in\r\nthis emulsion, and which will carry down the silver bromide as well. You\r\nsee here I can pour off the supernatant liquid clear, leaving our silver\r\nand gelatine as a clot at the bottom of the vessel.\r\n\r\nAnother action of chromic acid is, that it destroys the action of light\r\non silver bromide, so that up to this point operations can be carried on\r\nin broad daylight.\r\n\r\nThe precipitated emulsion is now taken into the dark room and washed\r\nuntil the wash water shows no trace of color; if there be a large\r\nquantity, this is best done on a fine muslin filter; if a small\r\nquantity, by decantation.\r\n\r\nHaving been thoroughly washed, I dissolve the pellicle in water by\r\nimmersing the beaker containing it in the water bath. I then add the\r\nremaining gelatine, and make up the whole with 3 ounces of alcohol and\r\nwater to 30 ounces for the quantities given. I pass the emulsion through\r\na funnel containing a pellet of cotton wool in order to filter it, and\r\nit is ready for coating the plates.\r\n\r\nTo coat a plate, I place it on this small block of leveled wood, and\r\npour on down a glass rod a small quantity of the emulsion, and by means\r\nof the rod held horizontally, spread it over the plate. I then transfer\r\nthe plate to this leveled slab of plate glass, in order that the\r\nemulsion on it may set. As soon as set, it is placed in the drying box.\r\n\r\nThis process, as here described, does not give plates of the highest\r\ndegree of sensitiveness, to attain which a further operation is\r\nnecessary; they are, however, of exceedingly good quality, and very\r\nsuitable for landscape work.--_Photo. News_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPICTURES ON GLASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe invention of M. E. Godard, of Paris, has for its object the\r\nreproduction of images and drawings, by means of vitrifiable colors on\r\nglass, wood, stone, on canvas or paper prepared for oil-painting and on\r\nother substances having polished surfaces, e. g., earthenware, copper,\r\netc. The original drawings or images should be well executed, and drawn\r\non white, or preferably bluish paper, similar to paper used for ordinary\r\ndrawings. In the patterns for glass painting, by this process, the place\r\nto be occupied is marked by the lead, before cutting the glass to suit\r\nthe various shades which compose the color of a panel, as is usually\r\ndone in this kind of work; the operation changes only when the glass\r\ncutter hands these sheets over to the man who undertakes the painting.\r\nThe sheets of glass are cut according to the lines of the drawing, and\r\nafter being well cleaned, they are placed on the paper on the places for\r\nwhich they have been cut out. If the window to be stained is of large\r\nsize and consists of several panels, only one panel is proceeded with\r\nat a time. The glass is laid on the reverse side of the paper (the side\r\nopposite to the drawing), the latter having been made transparent by\r\nsaturating it with petroleum. This operation also serves to fix the\r\noutlines of the drawing more distinctly, and to give more vigor to the\r\ndark tone of the paper. When the paper is thus prepared, and the sheets\r\nof glass each in its place, they are coated by means of a brush with\r\na sensitizing solution on the side which comes into contact with the\r\npaper. This coating should be as thin and as uniform as possible on\r\nthe surface of the glass. For more perfectly equalizing the coating, a\r\nsecond brush is used.\r\n\r\nThe sensitizing solution which serves to produce the verifiable image is\r\nprepared as follows: Bichromate of ammonia is dissolved in water till\r\nthe latter is saturated; five grammes of powdered dextrin or glucose are\r\nthen dissolved in 100 grammes of water; to either of these solutions\r\nis added 10 per cent. of the solution of bichromate, and the mixture\r\nfiltered.\r\n\r\nThe coating of the glass takes place immediately afterward in a dark\r\nroom; the coated sheets are then subjected to a heat of 50° or 60° C.\r\n(120° to 140° Fahr.) in a small hot chamber, where they are laid one\r\nafter the other on a wire grating situated 35 centimeters above the\r\nbottom. Care should be taken not to introduce the glass under treatment\r\ninto the hot chamber before the required degree of heat has been\r\nobtained. A few seconds are sufficient to dry each sheet, and the wire\r\ngrating should be large enough to allow of the dried glass being laid in\r\nrows, on one side where the heat is less intense. For the reproduction\r\nof the pictures or images a photographic copying frame of the size of\r\nthe original is used. A stained glass window being for greater security\r\ngenerally divided into different panels, the size of one panel is seldom\r\nmore than one square meter. If the picture to be reproduced should be\r\nlarger in size than any available copying frame, the prepared glass\r\nsheets are laid between two large sheets of plate-glass, and part after\r\npart is proceeded with, by sliding the original between the two sheets.\r\nA photographic copying frame, however, is always preferable, as it\r\npresses the glass sheets better against the original. The original\r\ndrawing is laid fiat on the glass of the frame. The lines where the lead\r\nis to connect the respective sheets of glass are marked on the drawing\r\nwith blue or red pencil. The prepared sheets of glass are then placed\r\none after the other on the original in their respective places, so that\r\nthe coated side comes in contact with the original. The frame is then\r\nclosed. It should be borne in mind that the latter operations must be\r\nperformed in the dark room. The closed frame is now exposed to light. If\r\nthe operations are performed outdoors, the frame is laid flat, so that\r\nthe light falls directly on it; if indoors, the frame is placed inclined\r\nbehind a window, so that it may receive the light in front. The time\r\nnecessary for exposing the frame depends upon the light and the\r\ntemperature; for instance, if the weather is fine and cloudless and the\r\ntemperature from 16° to 18° C. (60° to 64° Fahr.), it will require from\r\n12 to 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the time of exposure also depends on the\r\nthickness of the paper used for the original. If, however, the weather\r\nis dark, it requires from 30 to 50 minutes for the exposure. It will be\r\nobserved that if the temperature is above 25° C. (about 80° Fahr.), the\r\nsheets of glass should be kept very cool and be less dried; otherwise,\r\nwhen exposed the sheets are instantly metallized, and the reproduction\r\ncannot take place. The same inconvenience takes place if the temperature\r\nis beneath 5° C. (41° Fahr.). In this case the sheets should be kept\r\nwarm, and care should be taken not to expose the frame to the open air,\r\nbut always behind a glass window at a temperature of from 14° to 18°\r\nC. (about 60° Fahr.). The time necessary for the exposure can be\r\nascertained by taking out one of the many pieces of glass, applying to\r\nthe sensitive surface a vitrifiable color, and observing whether the\r\ncolor adheres well. If the color adheres but slightly to the dark, shady\r\nportions of the image, the exposure has been too long, and the process\r\nmust be recommenced; if, on the contrary, the color adheres too well,\r\nthe exposure has not been sufficient, the frames must be closed again,\r\nand the exposure continued. When the frame has been sufficiently\r\nexposed, it is taken into the dark room, the sensitized pieces of glass\r\nlaid on a plate of glass or marble with the sensitive surface turned\r\nupward, and the previously prepared vitrifiable color strewed over it by\r\nmeans of a few light strokes of a brush. This powder does not adhere to\r\nthe parts of the picture fully exposed to light, but adheres only to the\r\nmore or less shady portions of the picture. This operation develops\r\non the glass the image as it is on the paper. Thirty to 40 grammes\r\nof nitric acid are added to 1,000 grammes of wood-spirit, such as is\r\ngenerally used in photography, and the prepared pieces of glass are\r\ndipped into the bath, leaving them afterward to dry. If the bath becomes\r\nof a yellowish color, it must be renewed. This bath has for its object\r\nto remove the coating of bichromate, so as to allow the color to adhere\r\nto the glass, from which it has been separated by the layer of glucose\r\nand bichromate, which would prevent the vitrification. The bath has also\r\nfor its object to render the light parts of the picture perfectly\r\npure and capable of being easily retouched or painted by hand. The\r\napplication of variously colored enamels and the heating are then\r\neffected as in ordinary glass painting. The same process may be applied\r\nto marble, wood, stone, lava, canvas prepared for oil painting,\r\nearthenware, pure or enameled iron. The result is the same in all cases,\r\nand the process is the same as with glass, with the difference only that\r\nthe above named materials are not dipped into the bath, but the liquid\r\nis poured over the objects after the latter have been placed in an\r\ninclined position.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF HYDROGEN SULPHIDE FROM COAL-GAS.\r\n\r\nBy I. TAYLOR, B.A., Science Master at Christ College, Brecon.\r\n\r\n\r\nHydrogen sulphide may be prepared very easily, and sufficiently pure\r\nfor ordinary analytical purposes, by passing coal-gas through boiling\r\nsulphur. Coal-gas contains 40 to 50 per cent, of hydrogen, nearly the\r\nwhole of which may, by means of a suitable arrangement, be converted\r\ninto sulphureted hydrogen. The other constituents of coal-gas--methane,\r\ncarbon monoxide, olefines, etc.--are not affected by passing through\r\nboiling sulphur, and for ordinary laboratory work their removal is quite\r\nunnecessary, as they do not in any way interfere with the precipitation\r\nof metallic sulphides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARATION OF HYDROGEN SULPHIDE FROM COAL-GAS.]\r\n\r\nA convenient apparatus for the preparation of hydrogen sulphide from\r\ncoal-gas, such as we have at present in use in the Christ College\r\nlaboratory, consists of a retort, R, in which sulphur is placed.\r\nThrough the tubulure of the retort there passes a bent glass-tube, T E,\r\nperforated near the closed end, F, with a number of small holes. (The\r\nperforations are easily made by piercing the partially softened glass\r\nwith a white-hot steel needle; an ordinary crotchet needle, the hook\r\nhaving been removed and the end sharpened, answers the purpose very\r\nwell.) The end, T, of the glass tube is connected by caoutchouc tubing\r\nwith the coal-gas supply, the perforated end dipping into the sulphur.\r\nThe neck of the retort, inclined slightly upward to allow the condensed\r\nsulpur, as it remelts, to flow back, is connected with awash bottle, B,\r\nto which is attached the flask, F, containing the solution through which\r\nit is required to pass the hydrogen sulphide; F is connected with an\r\naspirator, A.\r\n\r\nAbout one pound of sulphur having been introduced into the retort and\r\nheated to the boiling-point, the tap of the aspirator is turned on and\r\na current of coal-gas drawn through the boiling sulphur; the hydrogen\r\nsulphide formed is washed by the water contained in B, passes on into\r\nF, and finally into the aspirator. The speed of the current may be\r\nregulated by the tap, and as the aspirator itself acts as a receptacle\r\nfor excess of gas, very little as a rule escapes into the room, and\r\nconsequently unpleasant smells are avoided.\r\n\r\nThis method of preparing sulphureted hydrogen will, I think, be found\r\nuseful in the laboratory. It is cleanly, much cheaper than the ordinary\r\nmethod, and very convenient. During laboratory work, a burner is placed\r\nunder the retort and the sulphur kept hot, so that its temperature may\r\nbe quickly raised to the boiling-point when the gas is required. From\r\ntime to time it is necessary to replenish the retort with sulphur and to\r\nremove the condensed portions from the neck.--_Chem.

SALISBURY, A.M., M.D.\r\n\r\nPRIZE ESSAY OF THE ALBANY MEDICAL COLLEGE ALUMNI ASSOCIATION, FEB.,\r\n1882.\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have made careful microscopic examinations of the blood in several\r\ncases of Panama fever I have treated, and find in all severe cases many\r\nof the colorless corpuscles filled more or less with spores of ague\r\nvegetation and the serum quite full of the same spores (see Fig. N,\r\nPlate VIII.).\r\n\r\nMr. John Thomas. Panama fever. Vegetation in blood and colorless\r\ncorpuscles. (Fig N, Plate VIII.) Vegetation, spores of, in the colorless\r\ncorpuscles of the blood. Spores in serum of blood adhering to fibrin\r\nfilaments.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas has charge of the bridge building on the Tehuantepec\r\nRailroad. Went there about one year ago. Was taken down with the fever\r\nlast October. Returned home in February last, all broken down. Put him\r\nunder treatment March 15, 1882. Gained rapidly (after washing him out\r\nwith hot water, and getting his urine clear and bowels open every day)\r\non two grains of quinia every day, two hours, till sixteen doses were\r\ntaken. After an interval of seven days, repeated the quinia, and so on.\r\nThis fever prevails on all the low lands, as soon as the fresh soil\r\nis exposed to the drying rays of the sun. The vegetation grows on the\r\ndrying soil, and the spores rise in the night air, and fall after\r\nsunrise. All who are exposed to the night air, which is loaded with the\r\nspores, suffer with the disease. The natives of the country suffer about\r\nas badly as foreigners. Nearly half of the workmen die of the disease.\r\nThe fever is a congestive intermittent of a severe type.\r\n\r\nHenry Thoman. Leucocythæmia. Spleen 11 inches in diameter, two white\r\nglobules to one red. German. Thirty-six years of age. Weight, 180\r\npounds. Colorless corpuscles very large and varying much in size, as\r\nseen at N. Corpuscles filled--many of them--with the spores of ague\r\nvegetation. Also spores swimming in serum.\r\n\r\nThis man has been a gardener back of Hoboken on ague lands, and has had\r\nague for two years preceding this disease.\r\n\r\nI will now introduce a communication made to me by a medical gentleman\r\nwho has followed somewhat my researches for many years, and has taken\r\ngreat pains of time and expense to see if my researches are correct.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT ON THE CAUSE OF AGUE.--BY DR. EPHRAIM CUTTER, TO THE WRITER\r\n\r\nAt your request I give the evidence on which I base my opinion that your\r\nplan in relation to ague is true.\r\n\r\nFrom my very start into the medical profession, I had a natural intense\r\ninterest in the causes of disease, which was also fostered by my father,\r\nthe late Dr. Cutter, who honored his profession nearly forty years.\r\nHence, I read your paper on ague with enthusiasm, and wrote to you for\r\nsome of the plants of which you spoke. You sent me six boxes containing\r\nsoil, which you said was full of the gemiasmas. You gave some drawings,\r\nso that I should know the plants when I saw them, and directed me to\r\nmoisten the soil with water and expose to air and sunlight. In the\r\ncourse of a few days I was to proceed to collect. I faithfully followed\r\nthe instructions, but without any success. I could detect no plants\r\nwhatever,\r\n\r\nThis result would have settled the case ordinarily, and I would have\r\nsaid that you were mistaken, as the material submitted by yourself\r\nfailed as evidence. But I thought that there was too much internal\r\nevidence of the truth of your story, and having been for many years\r\nan observer in natural history, I had learned that it is often very\r\ndifficult for one to acquire the art of properly making examinations,\r\neven though the procedures are of the simplest description. So I\r\ndistrusted, not you, but myself, and hence, you may remember, I forsook\r\nall and fled many hundred miles to you from my home with the boxes you\r\nhad sent me. In three minutes after my arrival you showed me how to\r\ncollect the plants in abundance from the very soil in the boxes that had\r\ntraveled so far backward and forward, from the very specimens on which I\r\nhad failed to do so.\r\n\r\nThe trouble was with me--that I went too deep with my needle. You showed\r\nme it was simply necessary to remove the slightest possible amount on\r\nthe point of a cambric needle; deposit this in a drop of clean water on\r\na slide cover with, a covering glass and put it under your elegant 1/5\r\ninch objective, and there were the gemiasmas just as you had described.\r\n\r\nI have always felt humbled by this teaching, and I at the time rejoiced\r\nthat instead of denouncing you as a cheat and fraud (as some did at that\r\ntime), I did not do anything as to the formation of an opinion until I\r\nhad known more and more accurately about the subject.\r\n\r\nI found all the varieties of the palmellæ you described in the boxes,\r\nand I kept them for several years and demonstrated them as I had\r\nopportunity. You also showed me on this visit the following experiments\r\nthat I regarded as crucial:\r\n\r\n1st. I saw you scrape from the skin of an ague patient sweat and\r\nepithelium with the spores and the full grown plants of the Gemiasma\r\nverdans.\r\n\r\n2d. I saw you take the sputa of a ague patient and demonstrate the\r\nspores and sporangia of the Gemiasma verdans.\r\n\r\n3d. I saw you take the urine of a female patient suffering from ague\r\n(though from motives of delicacy I did not see the urine voided--still I\r\nbelieve that she did pass the urine, as I did not think it necessary to\r\ninsult the patient), and you demonstrated to me beautiful specimens of\r\nGemiasma rubra. You said it was not common to find the full development\r\nin the urine of such cases, but only in the urine of the old severe\r\ncases. This was a mild case.\r\n\r\n4th. I saw you take the blood from the forearm of an ague patient, and\r\nunder the microscope I saw you demonstrate the gemiasma, white and\r\nbleached in the blood. You said that the coloring matter did not develop\r\nin the blood, that it was a difficult task to demonstrate the plants in\r\nthe blood, that it required usually a long and careful search of hours\r\nsometimes, and at other times the plants would be obtained at once.\r\n\r\nWhen I had fully comprehended the significance of the experiments I was\r\nfilled with joy, and like the converts in apostolic times I desired to\r\ngo about and promulgate the news to the profession. I did so in many\r\nplaces, notably in New York city, where I satisfactorily demonstrated\r\nthe plants to many eminent physicians at my room at the Fifth Avenue\r\nHotel; also before a medical society where more than one hundred persons\r\nwere present. I did all that I could, but such was the preoccupation of\r\nthe medical gentlemen that a respectful hearing was all I got. This is\r\nnot to be wondered at, as it was a subject, now, after the lapse of\r\nnearly a decade and a half, quite unstudied and unknown. After this I\r\nstudied the plants as I had opportunity, and in 1877 made a special\r\njourney to Long Island, N.Y., for the purpose of studying the plants in\r\ntheir natural habitat, when they were in a state of maturity. I have\r\nalso examined moist soils in localities where ague is occasionally\r\nknown, with other localities where it prevails during the warm months.\r\n\r\nBelow I give the results, which from convenience I divide into two\r\nparts: 1st. Studies of the ague plants in their natural habitat. 2d.\r\nStudies of the ague plants in their unnatural habitat (parasitic). I\r\nthink one should know the first before attempting the second.\r\n\r\n_First_--Studies to find in their natural habitat the palmellæ described\r\nas the Gemiasma rubra, Gemiasma verdans, Gemiasma plumba, Gemiasma alba,\r\nProtuberans lamella.\r\n\r\n_Second_--_Outfit_.--Glass slides, covers, needles, toothpicks, bottle\r\nof water, white paper and handkerchief, portable microscope with a good\r\nTolles one inch eyepiece, and one-quarter inch objective.\r\n\r\nWherever there was found on low, marshy soil a white incrustation like\r\ndried salt, a very minute portion was removed by needle or toothpick,\r\ndeposited on a slide, moistened with a drop of water, rubbed up with a\r\nneedle or toothpick into a uniformly diffused cloud in and through the\r\nwater. The cover was put on, and the excess of water removed by touching\r\nwith a handkerchief the edge of the cover. Then the capillary attraction\r\nheld the cover in place, as is well known. The handkerchief or white\r\npaper was spread on the ground at my feet, and the observation conducted\r\nat once after the collection and on the very habitat. It is possible\r\nthus to conduct observations with the microscope besides in boats on\r\nponds or sea, and adding a good kerosene light in bed or bunk or on\r\nlounge.\r\n\r\nAugust 11, 1877.--Excursion to College Point, Flushing, Long Island:\r\n\r\nObservation 1. 1:50 P.M. Sun excessively hot. Gathered some of the white\r\nincrustation on sand in a marsh west of Long Island Railroad depot.\r\nFound some Gemiasma verdans, G. rubra; the latter were dry and not good\r\nspecimens, but the field swarmed with the automobile spores. The full\r\ndeveloped plant is termed sporangia, and seeds are called spores.\r\n\r\nObservation 2. Another specimen from same locality, not good; that is,\r\nforms were seen but they were not decisive and characteristic.\r\n\r\nObservation 3. Earth from Wallabout, near Naval Hospital, Brooklyn, Rich\r\nin spores (A) with automobile protoplasmic motions, (B) Gemiasma rubra,\r\n(C) G. verdans, very beautiful indeed. Plants very abundant.\r\n\r\nObservation 4. Walking up the track east of L. I. R.R. depot, I took an\r\nincrustation near creek; not much found but dirt and moving spores.\r\n\r\nObservation 5. Seated on long marsh grass I scraped carefully from the\r\nstalks near the roots of the grass where the plants were protected from\r\nthe action of the sunlight and wind. Found a great abundance of mature\r\nGemiasma verdans very beautiful in appearance.\r\n\r\n_Notes_.--The time of my visit was most unfavorable. The best time is\r\nwhen the morning has just dawned and the dew is on the grass. One then\r\ncan find an abundance, while after the sun is up and the air is hot the\r\nplants disappear; probably burst and scatter the spores in billions,\r\nwhich, as night comes on and passes, develop into the mature plants,\r\nwhen they may be found in vast numbers. It would seem from this that the\r\nlife epoch of a gemiasma is one day under such circumstances, but I have\r\nknown them to be present for weeks under a cover on a slide, when the\r\nslide was surrounded with a bandage wet with water, or kept in a culture\r\nbox. The plants may be cultivated any time in a glass with a water\r\njoint. A, Goblet inverted over a saucer; B, filled with water; C, D,\r\nspecimen of earth with ague plants.\r\n\r\nObservation 6. Some Gemiasma verdaus; good specimens, but scanty.\r\nInnumerable mobile spores. Dried.\r\n\r\nObservation 7. Red dust on gray soil. Innumerable mobile spores. Dried\r\nred sporangia of G. rubra.\r\n\r\nObservation 8. White incrustation. Innumerable mobile spores. No plants.\r\n\r\nObservation 9. White incrustation. Many minute algæ, but two sporangia\r\nof a pale pink color; another variety of color of gemiasma. Innumerable\r\nmobile spores.\r\n\r\nObservation 10. Gemiasma verdans and G. rubra in small quantities.\r\nInnumerable mobile spores.\r\n\r\nObservation 11. Specimen taken from under the shade of short marsh\r\ngrass. Gemiasma exceedingly rich and beautiful. Innumerable mobile\r\nspores.\r\n\r\nObservation 12. Good specimens of Gemiasma rubra. Innumerable spores\r\npresent in all specimens.\r\n\r\nObservation 13. Very good specimens of Protuberans lamella.\r\n\r\nObservation 14. The same.\r\n\r\nObservation 15. Dead Gemiasma verdans and rubra.\r\n\r\nObservation 16. Collection very unpromising by macroscopy, but by\r\nmicroscopy showed many spores, mature specimens of Gemiasma rubra and\r\nverdans. One empty specimen with double walls.\r\n\r\nObservation 17. Dry land by the side of railroad. Protuberans not\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nObservation 18. From side of ditch. Filled with mature Geraiasma\r\nverdans.\r\n\r\nObservation 19. Moist earth near a rejected timber of the railroad\r\nbridge. Abundance of Gemiasma verdans, Sphærotheca Diatoms.\r\n\r\nObservation 20. Scrapings on earth under high grass. Large mature\r\nspecimens of Gemiasma rubra and verdans. Many small.\r\n\r\nObservation 21. Same locality. Gemiasma rubra and verdans; good\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nObservation 22. A dry stem of a last year's annual plant lay in the\r\nditch not submerged, that appeared as if painted red with iron rust.\r\nThis redness evidently made up of Gemiasma rubra dried.\r\n\r\nObservation 23. A twig submerged in a ditch was scraped. Gemiasma\r\nverdans found abundantly with many other things, which if rehearsed\r\nwould cloud this story.\r\n\r\nObservation 24. Scrapings from the dirty end of the stick (23) gave\r\nspecimens of the beautiful double wall palmellæ and some empty G.\r\nverdans.\r\n\r\nObservation 25. Stirred up the littoral margins of the ditch with stick\r\nfound in the path, and the drip showed Gemiasma rubra and verdans mixed\r\nin with dirt, debris, other algae, fungi, infusoria, especially diatoms.\r\n\r\nObservation 26. I was myself seized with sneezing and discharge running\r\nfrom nostrils during these examinations. Some of the contents of\r\nthe right nostril were blown on a slide, covered, and examined\r\nmorphologically. Several oval bodies, round algae, were found with the\r\ncharacteristics of G. verdans and rubra. Also some colorless sporangia,\r\nand spores abundantly present. These were in addition to the normal\r\nmorphological elements found in the excretions.\r\n\r\nObservation 27. Dried clay on margin of the river showed dry G. verdans.\r\n\r\nObservation 28. Saline dust on earth that had been thrown out during the\r\nsetting of a new post in the railroad bridge showed some Gemiasma alba.\r\n\r\nObservation 29. The dry white incrustation found on fresh earth near\r\nrailroad track entirely away from water, where it appeared as if\r\nwhite sugar or sand had been sprinkled over in a fine dust, showed\r\nan abundance of automobile spores and dry sporangia of G. rubra and\r\nverdans. It was not made up of salts from evaporation.\r\n\r\nObservation 30. Some very thick, long, green, matted marsh grass was\r\ncarefully separated apart like the parting of thick hair on the head. A\r\nlittle earth was taken from the crack, and the Protuberans lamella, the\r\nGemiasma rubra and verdans found were beautiful and well developed.\r\n\r\nObservation 31. Brooklyn Naval Hospital, August 12, 1877, 4 A.M. Called\r\nup by the Quartermaster. With Surgeon C. W. White, U.S.N., took (A) one\r\nfive inch glass beaker, bottomless, (B) three clean glass slides, (C)\r\nchloride of calcium solution, [symbol: dra(ch)m] i to [symbol: ounce] i\r\nwater. We went, as near as I could judge in the darkness, to about that\r\nportion of the wall that lies west of the hospital, southeast corner\r\n(now all filled up), where on the 10th of August previously I had found\r\nsome actively growing specimens of the Gemiasma verdans, rubra, and\r\nprotuberans. The chloride of calcium solution was poured into a glass\r\ntumbler, then rubbed over the inside and outside of the beaker. It was\r\nthen placed on the ground, the rim of the mouth coming on the soil and\r\nthe bottom elevated on an old tin pan, so that the beaker stood inclined\r\nat an angle of about forty-five degrees with the horizon. The slides\r\nwere moistened, one was laid on a stone, one on a clod, and a third on\r\nthe grass. Returned to bed, not having been gone over ten minutes.\r\n\r\nAt 6 A.M. collected and examined for specimens the drops of dew\r\ndeposited. Results: In every one of the five instances collected\r\nthe automobile spores, and the sporangia of the gemiasmas and the\r\nprotuberans on both sides of slides and beaker. There were also spores\r\nand mycelial filaments of fungi, dirt, and zoospores. The drops of dew\r\nwere collected with capillary tubes such as were used in Edinburgh for\r\nvaccine virus. The fluid was then preserved and examined in the naval\r\nlaboratory. In a few hours the spores disappeared.\r\n\r\nObservation 32. Some of the earth near the site of the exposure referred\r\nto in Observation 31, was examined and found to contain abundantly the\r\nGemiasma verdans, rubra, Protuberans lamella, confirmed by three more\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nObservation 33. In company with Surgeon F. M. Dearborne, U.S.N., in\r\ncharge of Naval Hospital, the same day later explored the wall about\r\nmarsh west of hospital. Found the area abundantly supplied with\r\npalmellæ, Gemiasma rubra, verdans, and Protuberans lamella, even where\r\nthere was no incrustation or green mould. Made very many examinations,\r\nalways finding the plants and spores, giving up only when both of us\r\nwere overcome with the heat.\r\n\r\nObservation 34. August, 1881. Visited the Wallabout; found it filled up\r\nwith earth. August 17. Visited the Flushing district; examined for the\r\ngemiasma the same localities above named, but found only a few dried up\r\nplants and plenty of spores. With sticks dug up the earth in various\r\nplaces near by. Early in September revisited the same, but found nothing\r\nmore; the incrustation, not even so much as before. The weather was\r\ncontinuously for a long time very dry, so much so that vegetables and\r\nmilk were scarce.\r\n\r\nThe grass and grounds were all dried up and cracked with fissures.\r\n\r\nThere must be some moisture for the development of the plants. Perhaps\r\nif I had been able to visit the spots in the early morning, it would\r\nhave been much better, as about the same time I was studying the same\r\nvegetation on 165th Street and 10th Avenue, New York, and found an\r\nabundance of the plants in the morning, but none scarcely in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nShould any care to repeat these observations, these limits should be\r\nobserved and the old adage about \"the early bird catching the worm,\"\r\netc. Some may object to this directness of report, and say that we\r\nshould report all the forms of life seen. To this I would say that\r\nthe position I occupy is much different from yours, which is that of\r\ndiscoverer. When a detective is sent out to catch a rogue, he tumbles\r\nhimself but little with people or things that have no resemblance to the\r\nrogue. Suppose he should return with a report as to the houses, plants,\r\nanimals, etc., he encountered in his search; the report might be very\r\ninteresting as a matter of general information, but rather out of place\r\nfor the parties who desire the rogue caught. So in my search I made a\r\nspecial work of catching the gemiasmas and not caring for anything else.\r\nStill, to remove from your mind any anxiety that I may possibly not have\r\nunderstood how to conduct my work, I will introduce here a report\r\nof search to find out how many forms of life and substances I could\r\nrecognize in the water of a hydrant fed by Croton water (two specimens\r\nonly), during the present winter (1881 and 1882) I beg leave to subjoin\r\nthe following list of species, not individuals, I was able to recognize.\r\nIn this list you will see the Gemiasma verdans distinguished from its\r\nassociate objects. I think I can in no other way more clearly show my\r\nright to have my honest opinion respected in relation to the subject in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MALARIA PLANTS COLLECTED SEPT. 10, 1882, AT WASHINGTON\r\nHEIGHTS, 176TH STREET, NEAR 10TH AVENUE, NEW YORK CITY, ETC.\r\n\r\nPLATE VIII.--A, B, C, Large plants of Gemiasma verdans.

This list will\r\ngive an idea of the variety of forms to be met with in the hunt for ague\r\nplants; still, they are as well marked in their physical characters as a\r\npotato is among the objects of nature. Although I know you are perfectly\r\nfamiliar with algæ, still, to make my report more complete, in case you\r\nshould see fit to have it pass out of your hands to others, allow me\r\nto give a short account of the Order Three of Algæ, namely, the\r\nChlorosporeæ or Confervoid Algæ, derived from the Micrographic\r\nDictionary, this being an accessible authority.\r\n\r\nAlgae form a class of the thallophytes or cellular plants in which the\r\nphysiological functions of the plant are delegated most completely to\r\nthe individual cell. That is to say, the marked difference of purpose\r\nseen in the leaves, stamens, seeds, etc., of the phanerogams or\r\nflowering plants is absent here, and the structures carrying on the\r\noperations of nutrition and those of reproduction are so commingled,\r\nconjoined, and in some cases identified, that a knowledge of the\r\nmicroscopic anatomy is indispensable even to the roughest conception of\r\nthe natural history of these plants; besides, we find these plants\r\nso simple that we can see through and through them while living in a\r\nnatural condition, and by means of the microscope penetrate to mysteries\r\nof organism, either altogether inaccessible, or only to be attained by\r\ndisturbing and destructive dissection, in the so called higher forms of\r\nvegetation. We say \"so-called\" advisedly, for in the Algæ are included\r\nthe largest forms of plant life.\r\n\r\nThe Macrocystis pyrifera, an Algæ, is the largest of all known plants.\r\nIt is a sea weed that floats free and unattached in the ocean. Covers\r\nthe area of two square miles, and is 300 feet in depth (Reinsch). At the\r\nsame time its structure on examination shows it to belong to the same\r\nclass of plants as the minute palmellæ which we have been studying.\r\nAlgæ are found everywhere in streams, ditches, ponds, even the smallest\r\naccumulations of water standing for any time in the open air, and\r\ncommonly on walls or the ground, in all permanently damp situations.\r\nThey are peculiarly interesting in regard to morphological conditions\r\nalone, as their great variety of conditions of organization are all\r\nvariations, as it were, on the theme of the simple vegetable cell\r\nproduced by change of form, number, and arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe Algæ comprehend a vast variety of plants, exhibiting a wonderful\r\nmultiplicity of forms, colors, sizes, and degrees of complexity of\r\nstructure, but algologists consider them to belong to three orders: 1.\r\nRed spored Algæ, called Rhodosporeæ or florideæ. 2. The dark or black\r\nspored Algæ, or Melanosporeæ or Fucoideæ. 3. The green spored Algæ,\r\nor Chlorosporeæ or Confervoideæ. The first two classes embrace the\r\nsea-weeds. The third class, marine and aquatic plants, most of which\r\nwhen viewed singly are microscopic. Of course some naturalists do not\r\nagree to these views. It is with order three, Confervoideæ, that we are\r\ninterested. These are plants growing in sea or fresh water, or on damp\r\nsurfaces, with a filamentous, or more rarely a leaf-like pulverulent\r\nor gelatinous thallus; the last two forms essentially microscopic.\r\nConsisting frequently of definitely arranged groups of distinct\r\ncells, either of ordinary structure or with their membrane\r\nsilicified--Diatomaceæ. We note three forms of fructification: 1.\r\nResting spores produced after fertilization either by conjugation or\r\nimpregnation. 2. Spermatozoids. 3. Zeospores; 2, 4, or multiciliated\r\nactive automobile cells--gonidia--discharged from the mother cells or\r\nplants without impregnation, and germinating directly. There is also\r\nanother increase by cell division.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF THE FAMILIES.\r\n\r\n1. _Lemaneæ_.--Frond filamentous, inarticulate, cartilaginous, leathery,\r\nhollow, furnished at irregular distances with whorls or warts, or\r\nnecklace shaped. Fructification: tufted, simple or branched, necklace\r\nshaped filaments attached to the inner surface of the tubular frond, and\r\nfinally breaking up into elliptical spores. Aquatic.\r\n\r\n2. _Batrachospermeæ_--Plants filamentous, articulated, invested with\r\ngelatine. Frond composed of aggregated, articulated, longitudinal cells,\r\nwhorled at intervals with short, horizontal, cylindrical or beaded,\r\njointed ramuli. Fructification: ovate spores and tufts of antheridial\r\ncells attached to the lateral ramuli, which consist of minute,\r\nradiating, dichotomous beaded filaments. Aquatic.\r\n\r\n3. _Chaetophoraceæ_.--Plants growing in the sea or fresh water, coated\r\nby gelatinous substance; either filiform or a number of filaments being\r\nconnected together constituting gelatinous, definitely formed, or\r\nshapeless fronds or masses. Filaments jointed, bearing bristle-like\r\nprocesses. Fructification: zoospores produced from the cell contents of\r\nthe filaments; resting spores formed from the contents of particular\r\ncells after impregnation by ciliated spermatozoids produced in distinct\r\nantheridial cells. Coleochætæ.\r\n\r\n4. _Confervaceæ_.--Plants growing in the sea or in fresh water,\r\nfilamentous, jointed, without evident gelatine (forming merely a\r\ndelicate coat around the separate filaments) Filaments very variable in\r\nappearance, simple or branched; the cells constituting the articulations\r\nof the filaments more or less filled with green, or very rarely brown or\r\npurple granular matter; sometimes arranged in peculiar patterns on the\r\nwalls, and convertible into spores or zoospores. Not conjugating.\r\n\r\n5. _Zygnemaceæ_.--Aquatic filamentous plants, without evident gelatine,\r\ncomposed of series of cylindrical cells, straight or curved. Cell\r\ncontents often arranged in elegant patterns on the walls. Reproduction\r\nresulting from conjugation, followed by the development of a true spore,\r\nin some genera dividing into four sporules before germinating.\r\n\r\n6. _OEdogoniaceæ_.--Simple or branched aquatic filamentous plants\r\nattached without gelatine. Cell contents uniform, dense, cell division\r\naccompanied by circumscissile debiscence of the parent cell, producing\r\nrings on the filaments. Reproduction by zoospores formed of the whole\r\ncontents of a cell, with a crown of numerous cilia; resting spores\r\nformed in sporangial cells after fecundation by ciliated spermatozoids\r\nformed in antheridial cells.\r\n\r\n7. _Siphonaceæ_--Plants found in the sea, fresh water, or on damp\r\nground; of a membranous or horny byaline substance, filled with green\r\nor colorless granular matter. Fronds consisting of continuous tubular\r\nfilaments, either free or collected into spongy masses of various\r\nshapes. Crustaceous, globular, cylindrical, or flat. Fructification: by\r\nzoospores, either single or very numerous, and by resting spores formed\r\nin sporangial cells after the contents have been impregnated by the\r\ncontents of autheridial cells of different forms.\r\n\r\n8 _Oscillatoriaceæ_.--Plants growing either in the sea, fresh water, or\r\non damp ground, of a gelatinous substance and filamentous structure.\r\nFilaments very slender, tubular, continuous, filled with colored,\r\ngranular, transversely striated substance; seldom blanched, though often\r\ncohering together so as to appear branched; usually massed together\r\nin broad floating or sessile strata, of a very gelatinous nature;\r\noccasionally erect and tufted, and still more rarely collected into\r\nradiating series bound together by firm gelatine and then forming\r\nglobose lobed or flat crustaceous fronds. Fructification: the internal\r\nmass or contents separating into roundish or lenticular gonidia.\r\n\r\n9. _Nostochacæ_.--Gelatinous plants growing in fresh water, or in damp\r\nsituations among mosses, etc.; of soft or almost leathery substance,\r\nconsisting of variously curled or twisted necklace-shaped filaments,\r\ncolorless or green, composed of simple, or in some stages double rows\r\nof cells, contained in a gelatinous matrix of definite form, or heaped\r\ntogether without order in a gelatinous mass. Some of the cells enlarged,\r\nand then forming either vesicular empty cells or densely filled\r\nsporangial cells. Reproduction: by the breaking up of the filaments, and\r\nby resting spores formed singly in the sporanges.\r\n\r\n10. _Ulvaceæ_.--Marine or aquatic algae consisting of membranous, flat,\r\nand expanded tubular or saccate fronds composed of polygonal cells\r\nfirmly joined together by their sides.\r\n\r\nReproduced by zoospores formed from the cell contents and breaking\r\nout from the surface, or by motionless spores formed from the whole\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\n11. _Palmellaceæ_.--Plants forming gelatinous or pulverulent crusts on\r\ndamp surfaces of stone, wood, earth, mud, swampy districts, or more\r\nor less regular masses of gelatinous substance or delicate\r\npseudo-membranous expansion or fronds, of flat, globular, or tubular\r\nform, in fresh water or on damp ground; composed of one or many,\r\nsometimes innumerable, cells, with green, red, or yellowish contents,\r\nspherical or elliptical form, the simplest being isolated cells found in\r\ngroups of two, four, eight, etc., in course of multiplication. Others\r\npermanently formed of some multiple of four; the highest forms made up\r\nof compact, numerous, more or less closely joined cells. Reproduction:\r\nby cell division, by the conversion of the cell contents into zoospores,\r\nand by resting spores, formed sometimes after conjugation; in other\r\ncases, probably, by fecundation by spermatozoids. All the unicellular\r\nalgæ are included under this head.\r\n\r\n12. _Desmidiaceæ_.--Microscopic gelatinous plants, of a screen color,\r\ngrowing in fresh water, composed of cells devoid of a silicious coat,\r\nof peculiar forms such as oval, crescentic, shortly cylindrical,\r\ncylindrical, oblong, etc., with variously formed rays or lobes, giving\r\na more or less stellate form, presenting a bilateral symmetry, the\r\njunction of the halves being marked by a division of the green contents;\r\nthe individual cells being free, or arranged in linear series, collected\r\ninto fagot-like bundles or in elegant star like groups which are\r\nembedded in a common gelatinous coat. Reproduced by division and by\r\nresting spores produced in sporangia formed after the conjugation of\r\ntwo cells and union of their contents, and by zoospores formed in the\r\nvegetative cells or in the germinating resting spores.\r\n\r\n13. _Diatomaceæ_.--Microscopic cellular bodies, growing in fresh,\r\nbrackish, and sea water: free or attached, single, or embedded in\r\ngelatinous tubes, the individual cells (frustules) with yellowish or\r\nbrown contents, and provided with a silicious coat composed of two\r\nusually symmetrical valves variously marked, with a connecting band or\r\nhoop at the suture. Multiplied by division and by the formation of new\r\nlarger individuals out of the contents of individual conjugated cells;\r\nperhaps also by spores and zoospores.\r\n\r\n14. _Volvocineæ_.--Microscopic cellular fresh water plants, composed of\r\ngroups of bodies resembling zoospores connected into a definite form\r\nby their enveloping membranes. The families are formed either of\r\nassemblages of coated zoospores united in a definite form by the\r\ncohesion of their membranes, or assemblages of naked zoospores inclosed\r\nin a common investing membrane. The individual zoospore-like bodies,\r\nwith two cilia throughout life, perforating the membranous coats, and by\r\ntheir conjoined action causing a free co-operative movement of the whole\r\ngroup. Reproduction by division, or by single cells being converted into\r\nnew families; and by resting spores formed from some of the cells after\r\nimpregnation by spermatozoids formed from the contents of other cells of\r\nthe same family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MALARIA PLANTS COLLECTED AT 165TH STREET, EAST OF 10TH\r\nAVENUE, OCT., 1881.\r\n\r\nPlate IX.--Large group of malaria plants, Gemiasma verdans, collected at\r\n165th Street, east of 10th Avenue, New York, in October, 1881, by Dr.\r\nEphraim Cutter, and projected by him with a solar microscope. Dr.\r\nCuzner--the artist--outlined the group on the screen and made the\r\nfinished drawing from the sketch. He well preserved the grouping and\r\nrelative sizes. The pond hole whence they came was drained in the spring\r\nof 1882, and in August was covered with coarse grass and weeds. No\r\nplants were found there in satisfactory quantity, but those figured\r\non Plate VIII. were found half a mile beyond. This shows how draining\r\nremoves the malaria plants.]\r\n\r\nFrom the description I think you have placed your plants in the right\r\nfamily. And evidently they come in the genera named, but at present\r\nthere is in the authorities at my command so much confusion as to the\r\ngenera, as given by the most eminent authorities, like Nageli, Kutzing,\r\nBraun Rabenht, Cohn, etc., that I think it would be quite unwise for\r\nme to settle here, or try to settle here, questions that baffle the\r\nnaturalists who are entirely devoted to this specialty. We can safely\r\nleave this to them. Meantime let us look at the matter as physicians\r\nwho desire the practical advantages of the discovery you have made.\r\nTo illustrate this position let us take a familiar case. A boy going\r\nthrough the fields picks and eats an inedible mushroom. He is poisoned\r\nand dies. Now, what is the important part of history here from a\r\nphysician's point of view? Is it not that the mushroom poisoned the\r\nchild? Next comes the nomenclature. What kind of agaricus was it? Or was\r\nit one of the gasteromycetes, the coniomycetes, the hyphomycetes, the\r\nascomycetes, or one of the physomycetes? Suppose that the fungologists\r\nare at swords' points with each other about the name of the particular\r\nfungus that killed the boy? Would the physicians feel justified to sit\r\ndown and wait till the whole crowd of naturalists were satisfied, and\r\nthe true name had been settled satisfactorily to all? I trow not; they\r\nwould warn the family about eating any more; and if the case had not yet\r\nperished, they would let the nomenclature go and try all the means that\r\nhistory, research, and instructed common sense would suggest for the\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nThis leads me here to say that physicians trust too much to the simple\r\ndicta of men who may be very eminent in some department of natural\r\nhistory, and yet ignorant in the very department about which, being\r\ncalled upon, they have given an opinion. All everywhere have so much\r\nto learn that we should be very careful how we reject new truths,\r\nespecially when they come from one of our number educated in our own\r\nmedical schools, studied under our own masters. If the subject is\r\none about which we know nothing, we had better say so when asked our\r\nopinion, and we should receive with respect what is respectfully offered\r\nby a man whom we know to be honest, a hard worker, eminent in his\r\ndepartment by long and tedious labors. If he asks us to look over his\r\nevidence, do so in a kindly spirit, and not open the denunciations of\r\nbar room vocabularies upon the presenter, simply because we don't see\r\nhis point. In other words, we should all be receptive, but careful in\r\nour assimilation, remembering that some of the great operations in\r\nsurgery, for example, came from laymen in low life, as the operation for\r\nstone, and even the operation of spaying came from a swineherd.\r\n\r\nIt is my desire, however, to have this settled as far as can be among\r\nscientists, but for the practical uses of practicing physicians I say\r\nthat far more evidence has been adduced by you in support of the cause\r\nof intermittent fever than we have in the etiology of many other\r\ndiseases. I take the position that so long as no one presents a better\r\nhistory of the etiology of intermittent fever by facts and observations,\r\nyour theory must stand. This, too, notwithstanding what may be said to\r\nthe contrary.\r\n\r\nCertainly you are to be commended for having done as you have in this\r\nmatter. It is one of the great rights of the profession, and duties\r\nalso, that if a physician has or thinks he has anything that is new and\r\nvaluable, to communicate it, and so long as he observes the rules of\r\ngood society the profession are to give him a respectful hearing,\r\neven though he may have made a mistake. I do not think you had a fair\r\nhearing, and hence so far as I myself am concerned I indorse your\r\nposition, and shall do so till some one comes along and gives a better\r\ndemonstration. Allow me also to proceed with more evidence.\r\n\r\nObservation at West Falmouth, Mass., Sept 1, 1877. I made five\r\nobservations in like manner about the marshes and bogs of this town,\r\nwhich is, as it were, situated on the tendo achillis of Cape Cod, Mass.\r\nIn only one of these observations did I find any palmellæ like the ague\r\nplants, and they were not characteristic.\r\n\r\nChelsea, Mass., near the Naval Hospital, September 5, 1877. Three sets\r\nof observations. In all spores were found and some sporangia, but\r\nthey were not the genuine plants as far as I could judge. They were\r\nProtococcaceæ. It is not necessary to add that there are no cases of\r\nintermittent fever regarded as originating on the localities named.\r\nStill, the ancient history of New England contains some accounts of ague\r\noccurring there, but they are not regarded as entirely authentic.\r\n\r\nObservation. Lexington, Mass, September 6, 1877. Observation made in\r\na meadow. There was no saline incrustation, and no palmellæ found. No\r\nlocal malaria.\r\n\r\nObservation. Cambridge, Mass. Water works on the shore of Fresh Pond.\r\nFound a few palmellæ analogous to, but not the ague palmellæ.\r\n\r\nObservation. Woburn, Mass, September 27, 1877, with Dr. J. M. Moore.\r\nFound some palmellæ, but scanty. Abundance of spores of cryptogams.\r\n\r\nObservation. Stonington, Conn., August 15, 1877. Examined a pond hole\r\nnearly opposite the railroad station on the New York Shore Line. Found\r\nabundantly the white incrustation on the surface of the soil. Here I\r\nfound the spores and the sporangias of the gemiasmas verdans and rubra.\r\n\r\nObservation 2. Repetition of the last.\r\n\r\nObservation 3. I examined some of an incrustation that was copiously\r\ndeposited in the same locality, which was not white or frosty, but dark\r\nbrown and a dirty green. Here the spores were very abundant, and a few\r\nsporangias of the Gemiasma rubra. Ague has of late years been noted in\r\nConnecticut and Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nObservations in Connecticut. Middlefield near Middletown, summer of\r\n1878. Being in this locality, I heard that intermittent fever was\r\nadvancing eastward at the rate of ten miles a year. It had been observed\r\nin Middlefield. I was much interested to see if I could find the\r\ngemiasmas there. On examining the dripping of some bog moss, I found a\r\nplenty of them.\r\n\r\nObservations in Connecticut. New Haven. Early in the summer of 1881 I\r\nvisited this city. One object of my visit was to ascertain the truth\r\nof the presence of intermittent fever there, which I had understood\r\nprevailed to such an extent that my patient, a consumptive, was afraid\r\nto return to his home in New Haven. At this time I examined the hydrant\r\nwater of the city water works, and also the east shore of the West\r\nRiver, which seemed to be too full of sewage. I found a plenty of the\r\nOscillatoreaceæ, but no Palmellæ.\r\n\r\nIn September I revisited the city, taking with me a medical gentleman\r\nwho, residing in the South, had had a larger experience with the disease\r\nthan I. From the macroscopical examination he pronounced a case we\r\nexamined to be ague, but I was not able to detect the plants either in\r\nthe urine or blood. This might have been that I did not examine long\r\nenough. But a little later I revisited the city and explored the soil\r\nabout the Whitney Water Works, whence the city gets its supply of\r\nwater, and I had no difficulty in finding a good many of the plants\r\nyou describe as found by you in ague cases. At a still later period my\r\npatient, whom I had set to use the microscope and instructed how to\r\ncollect the ague plants, set to work himself. One day his mother brought\r\nin a film from off an ash pile that lay in the shade, and this her son\r\nfound was made up of an abundance of the ague plants. By simply winding\r\na wet bandage around the slide, Mr. A. was enabled to keep the plants\r\nin good condition until the time of my next visit, when I examined and\r\npronounced them to be genuine plants.\r\n\r\nI should here remark that I had in examining the sputa of this patient\r\nsent to me, found some of the ague plants. He said that he had been\r\nriding near the Whitney Pond, and perceived a different odor, and\r\nthought he must have inhaled the miasm. I told him he was correct in his\r\nsupposition, as no one could mistake the plants; indeed, Prof. Nunn, of\r\nSavannah, Ga., my pupil recognized it at once.\r\n\r\nThis relation, though short, is to me of great importance. So long as I\r\ncould not detect the gemiasmas in New Haven, I was very skeptical as to\r\nthe presence of malaria in New Haven, as I thought there must be some\r\nmistake, it being a very good cloak to hide under (malaria). There is no\r\ndoubt but that the name has covered lesions not belonging to it. But now\r\nthe positive demonstrations above so briefly related show to my mind\r\nthat the local profession have not been mistaken, and have sustained\r\ntheir high reputation.\r\n\r\nI should say that I have examined a great deal of sputa, but, with the\r\nexception of cases that were malarious, I have not encountered the\r\nmature plants before. Of course I have found them as you did, in my own\r\nexcretions as I was traveling over ague bogs.\r\n\r\n[_To be continued_.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICHTHYOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. P.G. UNNA, of Hamburg, has lately been experimenting on the dermato\r\ntherapeutic uses of a substance called ichthyol, obtained by Herr\r\nRudolph Schroter by the distillation of bituminous substances and\r\ntreatment with condensed sulphuric acid. This body, though tar-like in\r\nappearance, and with a peculiar and disagreeable smell of its own, does\r\nnot resemble any known wood or coal tar in its chemical and physical\r\nproperties. It has a consistence like vaseline, and its emulsion with\r\nwater is easily washed off the skin. It is partly soluble in alcohol,\r\npartly in ether with a changing and lessening of the smell, and totally\r\ndissolves in a mixture of both. It may be mixed with vaseline, lard,\r\nor oil in any proportions. Its chemical constitution is not well\r\nestablished, but it contains sulphur, oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and also\r\nphosphorus in vanishing proportions, and it may be considered comparable\r\nwith a 10 per cent, sulphur salve. Over ordinary sulphur preparations\r\nit has this advantage, that the sulphur is in very intimate and stable\r\nunion, so that ichthyol can be united with lead and mercury preparations\r\nwithout decomposition. Ichthyol when rubbed undiluted on the normal skin\r\ndoes not set up dermatitis, yet it is a resolvent, and in a high degree\r\na soother of pain and itching. In psoriasis it is a fairly good remedy,\r\nbut inferior to crysarobin in P. inveterata. It is useful also locally\r\nin rheumatic affections as a resolvent and anodyne, in acne, and as a\r\nparasiticide. The most remarkable effects, however, were met with in\r\neczema, which was cured in a surprisingly short time. From an experience\r\nin the treatment of thirty cases of different kinds--viz., obstinate\r\ncircumscribed moist patches on the hands and arms, intensely itching\r\npapular eczema of the flexures and face, infantile moist eczemas,\r\netc.--he recommends the following procedure. As with sulphur\r\npreparations, he begins with a moderately strong preparation, and as\r\nhe proceeds reduces the strength of the application. For moist eczema\r\nweaker preparations (20 to 30 per cent. decreased to 10 per cent.) must\r\nbe used than for the papular condition (50 per cent. reduced to 20 per\r\ncent.), and the hand, for example, will require a stronger application\r\nthan the face, and children a weaker one than adults; but ichthyol may\r\nbe used in any strength from a 5 per cent. to a 40 to 50 per cent.\r\napplication or undiluted. For obstinate eczema of the hands the\r\nfollowing formula is given as very efficacious: R. Lithargyri 10.0;\r\ncoq.c. aceti, 30.0; ad reman. 20.0; adde olei olivar., adipis, aa 10.0;\r\nichthyol 10.0, M. ft. ung. Until its internal effects are better known,\r\ncaution is advised as to its very widespread application, although\r\nHerr Schroter has taken a gramme with only some apparent increase of\r\nperistalsis and appetite.--_Lancet_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOPSY TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe illustration represents an autopsy table placed in the Coroner's\r\nDepartment of the New York Hospital, designed by George B. Post and\r\nFrederick C. Merry.\r\n\r\nAn amphitheater, fitted up for the convenience of the jury and those\r\ninterested when inquests are held, surrounds the table, which is placed\r\nin the center of the floor, thus enabling the subject to be viewed by\r\nthe coroner's jury and other officials who may be present.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical construction of this table will be readily understood by\r\nthe following explanation:\r\n\r\nThe top, indicated by letter, A, is made of thick, heavy, cast glass,\r\nconcaved in the direction of the strainer, as shown. It is about eight\r\nfeet long and two feet and six inches wide, in one piece, an opening\r\nbeing left in the center to receive the strainer, so as to allow the\r\nfluid matter of the body, as well as the water with which it is washed,\r\nto find its way to the waste pipe below the table, and thus avoid\r\nsoiling or staining the floor,\r\n\r\nThe strainer is quite large, with a downward draught which passes\r\nthrough a large flue, as shown by letter, F, connected above the water\r\nseal of the waste trap and trunk of the table to the chimney of the\r\nboiler house, as indicated by the arrows, carrying down all offensive\r\nodors from the body, thereby preventing the permeating of the air in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED AUTOPSY TABLE.]\r\n\r\nThe base of the table, indicated by letter, B, represents a ground\r\nswinging attachment, which enables the turning of the table in any\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nD represents the cold water supply cock and handle, intersecting with\r\nletter, E, which is the hot water cock, below the base, as shown, and\r\nthen upward to a swing or ball joint, C, then crossing under the plate\r\nglass top to the right with a hose attachment for the use of the\r\noperator. Here a small hose pipe is secured, for use as may be required\r\nin washing off all matter, to insure the clean exposure of the parts to\r\nbe dissected. The ball swing, C, enables the turning of the table in any\r\ndirection without disturbing the water connections. This apparatus has\r\nbeen in operation since the building of the hospital in 1876, and has\r\nmet all the requirements in connection with its uses.--_Hydraulic\r\nPlumber_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXCITING PROPERTIES OF OATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiments have been recently made by Mr. Sanson with a view to\r\nsettling the question whether oats have or have not the excitant\r\nproperty that has been attributed to them. The nervous and muscular\r\nexcitability of horses was carefully observed with the aid of graduated\r\nelectrical apparatus before and after they had eaten a given quantity\r\nof oats, or received a little of a certain principle which Mr. Sanson\r\nsucceeded in isolating from oats. The chief results of the inquiry are\r\nas follows: The pericarp of the fruit of oats contains a substance\r\nsoluble in alcohol and capable of exciting the motor cells of the\r\nnervous system. This substance is not (as some have thought) vanilline\r\nor the odorous principle of vanilla, nor at all like it. It is a\r\nnitrogenized matter which seems to belong to the group of alkaloids; is\r\nuncrystallizable, finely granular, and brown in mass. The author calls\r\nit \"avenine.\" All varieties of cultivated oats seem to elaborate it, but\r\nthey do so in very different degrees. The elaborated substance is the\r\nsame in all varieties. The differences in quantity depend not only on\r\nthe variety of the plant but also on the place of cultivation. Oats of\r\nthe white variety have much less than those of the dark, but for some\r\nof the former, in Sweden, the difference is small; while for others, in\r\nRussia, it is considerable. Less than 0.9 of the excitant principle per\r\ncent. of air-dried oats, the dose is insufficient to certainly affect\r\nthe excitability of horses, but above this proportion the excitant\r\naction is certain. While some light-colored oats certainly have\r\nconsiderable excitant power, some dark oats have little. Determination\r\nof the amount of the principle present is the only sure basis of\r\nappreciation, though (as already stated) white oats are likely to\r\nbe less exciting than dark. Crushing or grinding the grain weakens\r\nconsiderably the excitant property, probably by altering the substance\r\nto which it is due; the excitant action is more prompt, but much less\r\nstrong and durable. The action, which is immediate and more intense\r\nwith the isolated principle, does not appear for some minutes after the\r\neating of oats; in both cases it increases to a certain point, then\r\ndiminishes and disappears. The total duration of the effect is stated to\r\nbe an hour per kilogramme of oats ingested.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFILARIA DISEASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rapid strides which our knowledge has made during the past few years\r\nin the subject of the filaria parasite have been mainly owing to the\r\ndiligent researches of Dr. Patrick Manson, who continues to work at the\r\nquestion. In the last number of the _Medical Reports for China_, Dr.\r\nManson deals with the phenomenon known as \"filarial periodicity,\" and\r\nwith the fate of embryo parasites not removed from the blood. The\r\nintimate pathology of the disease, and the subject of abscess caused\r\nby the death of the parent filaria, also receive further attention.\r\nAn endeavor to explain the phenomenon of \"filarial periodicity\" by an\r\nappeal to the logical \"method of concomitant variations\" takes Manson\r\ninto an interesting excursion which is not productive of any positive\r\nresults; nor is any more certain conclusion come to with regard to the\r\nfate of the embryos which disappear from the blood during the day time.\r\nManson does not incline to the view that there is a diurnal intermittent\r\nreproduction of embryos with a corresponding destruction. An original\r\nand important speculation is made with respect to the intimate pathology\r\nof elephantiasis, chyluria, and lymph scrotum, which is thoroughly\r\nworthy of consideration. Our readers are probably aware that the parent\r\nfilaria and the filaria sanguinis hominis may exist in the human body\r\nwithout entailing any apparent disturbance. The diameter of an\r\nembryo filaria is about the same as that of a red blood disk, one\r\nthree-thousandth of an inch. The dimensions of an ovum are one\r\nseven-hundred-and-fiftieth by one five-hundredth of an inch. If we\r\nimagine the parent filaria located in a distal lymphatic vessel to abort\r\nand give birth to ova instead of embryos, it may be understood that the\r\nova might be unable to pass such narrow passages as the embryo could,\r\nand this is really the hypothesis which Manson has put forward on the\r\nstrength of observations made on two cases. The true pathology of the\r\nelephantoid diseases may thus be briefly summarized: A parent filaria in\r\na distant lymphatic prematurely expels her ova; these act as emboli\r\nto the nearest lymphatic glands, whence ensues stasis of lymph,\r\nregurgitation of lymph, and partial compensation by anastomoses of\r\nlymphatic vessels; this brings about hypertrophy of tissues, and may go\r\non to lymphorrhoea or chyluria, according to the site of the obstructed\r\nlymphatics. It may be objected that too much is assumed in supposing\r\nthat the parent worm is liable to miscarry. But as Manson had sufficient\r\nevidence in two cases that such abortions had happened, he thinks it is\r\nnot too much to expect their more frequent occurrence. The explanation\r\ngiven of the manner in which elephantoid disease is produced applies to\r\nmost, if not all, diseases, with one exception, which result from the\r\npresence of the parasite in the human body. The death of the parent\r\nparasite in the afferent lymphatic may give rise to an abscess, and the\r\nfrequency with which abscess of the scrotum or thigh is met with in\r\nChinese practice is, in Manson's opinion, attributable to this. Dr.\r\nManson's report closes with an account of a case of abscess of the\r\nthigh, with varicose inguinal glands, in which fragments of a mature\r\nworm were discovered in the contents of the abscess.--_Lancet_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPECTRAL MASDEVALLIA.\r\n\r\n(_M. chimæra_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all orchids no genus we can just now call to mind is more distinct or\r\nis composed of species more widely divergent in size, form, structure,\r\nand color than is this one of Masdevallia. It was founded well nigh a\r\ncentury ago by Ruiz and Pavon on a species from Mexico, M. uniflora.\r\nwhich, so far as I know, is nearly if not quite unknown to present day\r\ncultivators. When Lindley wrote his \"Genera and Species\" in 1836, three\r\nspecies of Masdevallias only were known to botanists but twenty-five\r\nyears later, when he prepared his \"Folio Orchidaceæ,\" nearly forty\r\nspecies were; known in herbaria, and to-day perhaps fully a hundred\r\nkinds are grown in our gardens, while travelers tell us of all the\r\ngorgeous beauties which are known to exist high up on the cloud-swept\r\nsides of the Andes and Cordilleras of the New World. The Masdevallia\r\nis confined to the Western hemisphere alone, and as in bird and animal\r\ndistribution, so in the case of many orchids we find that when any genus\r\nis confined to one hemisphere, those who look for another representative\r\ngenus in the other are rarely disappointed. Thus hornbills in the East\r\nare represented by toucans in the West, and the humming bird of the West\r\nby the sunbird of the East, and so also in the Malayan archipelago.\r\nNotably in Borneo we find bolbophyls without pseudo bulbs, and with\r\nsolitary or few flowered scapes and other traits singularly suggestive\r\nat first sight of the Western Masdevallia. Thus some bolbophyl, for\r\nexample, have caudal appendages to their sepals, as in Masdevallias,\r\nand on the other hand some Masdevallias have their labellums hinged\r\nand oscillatory, which is so commonly the case as to be \"almost\r\ncharacteristic\" in the genus Bolbophyllum or Sarcopodium. Speaking\r\ngenerally, Masdevallias, coming as most of them do from high altitudes,\r\nlend themselves to what is now well known as \"cool treatment,\" and\r\ncultivators find it equally necessary to offer them moisture in\r\nabundance both at the root and in the atmosphere, also seeing that when\r\nat home in cloud-land they are often and well nigh continually drenched\r\nby heavy dews and copious showers.\r\n\r\nOf all the cultivated Masdevallias, none are so weirdly strange and\r\nfascinating as is the species M. chimæra, which is so well illustrated\r\nin the accompany engraving. This singular plant was discovered by\r\nBenedict Roezl, and about 1872 or 1873 I remember M. Lucien Linden\r\ncalling upon me one day, and among other rarities showing me a dried\r\nflower of this species. I remember I took up a pen and rapidly made a\r\nsketch of the flower, which soon after appeared (1873, p. 3) in _The\r\nFlorist_, and was perhaps the first published figure of the plant. It\r\nwas named by Professor Reichenbach, who could find for it no better\r\nname than that of the mythical monster Chimæra, than which, as an old\r\nhistorian tells us, no stranger bogy ever came out of the earth's\r\ninside. Our engraving shows the plant about natural size, and indicates\r\nthe form and local coloring pretty accurately. The ground color is\r\nyellowish, blotched with lurid brownish crimson, the long pendent tails\r\nbeing blood color, and the interior of the sepals are almost shaggy.\r\nThe spectral appearance of the flower is considerably heightened by the\r\nsmooth, white, slipper-like lip, which contrasts so forcibly in color\r\nand texture with the lurid shagginess around it. Sir J. D. Hooker, in\r\ndescribing this species in the _Botanical Magazine_, t. 6, 152, says\r\nthat the aspect of the curved scape as it bears aloft its buds and hairy\r\nflowers is very suggestive of the head and body of a viper about to\r\nstrike. Dr. Haughton, F.R.S., told me long ago that Darlingtonia\r\ncalifornica always reminds him of a cobra when raised and puffed out in\r\na rage, and certainly the likeness is a close one.\r\n\r\nGrown in shallow teak wood baskets, suspended near the roof in a\r\npartially shaded structure, all the chimæroid section of Masdevallia\r\nsucceed even better than when grown in pots or pans, as they have a\r\nStanhopea-like habit of pushing out their flowers at all sorts of\r\ndeflected angles. A close glance at the engraving will show that for\r\nconvenience sake the artist has propped up the flower with a stick, this\r\nmuch arrangement being a necessity, so as to enable the tails to lie\r\ndiagonally across the picture. From tip to tip the flower represented is\r\n9 inches, or not so much by 7 inches as the flower measured in Messrs.\r\nBackhouse's nursery at York.--_The Garden_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SPECTRAL MASDEVALLIA.--MASDEVALLIA CHIMÆRA (Natural\r\nSize)]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSURVEY OF THE BLACK CAÑON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is rumored again that a survey is soon to be made through the\r\nheaviest portion of the Black Canon of the Gunnison. For a long distance\r\nthe walls of syenite rise to the stupendous height of 3,000 feet, and\r\nfor 1,800 feet the walls of the cañon are arched not many feet from the\r\nbed of the river.

W. SPENCER, B.A.Sc., Ph.D., F.G.S., Professor of Geology in the\r\nState University of Missouri.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical geology is the science which deals with the past changes of\r\nthe earth's crust, and the causes which have produced the present\r\ngeographical features, everywhere seen about us. The subject of the\r\npresent address must therefore be considered as one of geology rather\r\nthan of geography, and I propose to trace for you the early history of\r\nthe great Mississippi River, of which we have only a diminished remnant\r\nof the mightiest river that ever flowed over any terrestrial continent.\r\n\r\nBy way of introduction, I wish you each to look at the map of our great\r\nriver, with its tributaries as we now see it, draining half of the\r\ncentral portion of the continent, but which formerly drained, in\r\naddition, at least two of our great lakes, and many of the great rivers\r\nat the present time emptying into the colder Arctic Sea.\r\n\r\nLet us go back, in time, to the genesis of our continent. There was once\r\na time in the history of the earth when all the rocks were in a molten\r\ncondition, and the waters of our great oceans in a state of vapor,\r\nsurrounding the fiery ball. Space is intensely cold. In course of time\r\nthe earth cooled off, and on the cold, solid crust geological agencies\r\nbegan to work. It is now conceded by the most accomplished physicists\r\nthat the location of the great continents and seas was determined by\r\nthe original contraction and cooling of the earth's crust; though very\r\ngreatly modified by a long succession of changes, produced by the\r\nagencies of \"water, air, heat, and cold,\" through probably a hundred\r\nmillion of years, until the original rock surface of the earth has been\r\nworked over to a depth of thirty or forty miles.\r\n\r\nLike human history, the events of these long _æons_ are divided into\r\nperiods. The geologist divides the past history of the earth and its\r\ninhabitants into five Great Times; and these, again, into ages, periods,\r\nepochs, and eras.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the first Great Time--called Archæan--the continent\r\nsouth of the region of the great lakes, excepting a few islands, was\r\nstill submerged beneath a shallow sea, and therefore no portion of the\r\nMississippi was yet in existence. At the close of the second great\r\ngeological Time--the Palæozoic--the American continent had emerged\r\nsufficiently from the ocean bed to permit the flow of the Ohio, and of\r\nthe Mississippi, above the mouth of the former river, although they were\r\nnot yet united.\r\n\r\nThroughout the third great geological Time--the Mesozoic--these rivers\r\ngrew in importance, and the lowest portions of the Missouri began to\r\nform a tributary of some size. Still the Ohio had not united with the\r\nMississippi, and both of these rivers emptied into an arm of the Mexican\r\nGulf, which then reached to a short distance above what is now their\r\njunction.\r\n\r\nIn point of time, the Ohio is probably older than the Mississippi, but\r\nthe latter river grew and eventually absorbed the Ohio as a tributary.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the fourth great geological Time--the\r\nCenozoic--nearly the whole continent was above water. Still the Gulf of\r\nMexico covered a considerable portion of the extreme Southern States,\r\nand one of its bays extended as far north as the mouth of the Ohio,\r\nwhich had not yet become a tributary of the Mississippi. The Missouri\r\nthroughout its entire length was at this time a flowing river.\r\n\r\nI told you that the earth's crust had been worked over to a depth of\r\nmany miles since geological time first commenced. Subsequently, I have\r\nreferred to the growth of the continent in different geological periods.\r\nAll of our continents are being gradually worn down by the action of\r\nrains, rills, rivulets, and rivers, and being deposited along the sea\r\nmargins, just as the Mississippi is gradually stretching out into the\r\nGulf, by the deposition of the muds of the delta. This encroachment on\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico may continue, yea, doubtless will, until that deep\r\nbody of water shall have been filled up by the remains of the continent,\r\nborne down by the rivers; for the Mississippi alone carries annually 268\r\ncubic miles of mud into the Gulf, according to Humphreys and Abbot. This\r\nrepresents the valley of the Mississippi losing one foot off its whole\r\nsurface in 6,000 years. And were this to continue without any elevation\r\nof the land, the continent would all be buried beneath the sea in a\r\nperiod of about four and a half million years. But though this wasting\r\nis going on, the continent will not disappear, for the relative\r\npositions of the land and water are constantly changing; in some cases\r\nthe land is undergoing elevation, in others, subsidence. Prof. Hilgard\r\nhas succeeded in measuring known changes of level, in the lower\r\nMississippi Valley, and records the continent as having been at least\r\n450 feet higher than at present (and if we take the coast survey\r\nsoundings, it seems as if we might substitute 3,000 feet as the\r\nelevation), and subsequently at more than 450 feet lower, and then the\r\nchange back to the present elevation.\r\n\r\nLet us now study the history of the great river in the last days of the\r\nCenozoic Time, and early days of the fifth and last great Geological\r\nTime, in which we are now living--the Quaternary, or Age of Man--an\r\nepoch which I have called _the \"Great River Age_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to the condition of the Mississippi during this period and its\r\nsubsequent changes to its present form that I wish particularly to call\r\nyour attention. During the Great River age we know that the eastern\r\ncoast of the continent stood at least 1,200 feet higher than at present.\r\nThe region of the Lower Mississippi was also many hundred feet higher\r\nabove the sea level than now. Although we have not the figures for\r\nknowing the exact elevation of the Upper Mississippi, yet we have the\r\ndata for knowing that it was very much higher than at the present day.\r\n\r\n_The Lower Mississippi_, from the Gulf to the mouth of the Ohio River,\r\nwas of enormous size flowing through a valley with an average width of\r\nabout fifty miles, though varying from about twenty-five to seventy\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIn magnitude, we can have some idea, when we observe the size of the\r\nlower three or four hundred miles of the Amazon River, which has a width\r\nof about fifty miles. But its depth was great, for the waters not only\r\nfilled a channel now buried to a depth of from three to five hundred\r\nfeet, but stood at an elevation much higher than the broad bottom lands\r\nwhich now constitute those fertile alluvial flats of the Mississippi\r\nValley, so liable to be overflowed.\r\n\r\nFrom the western side, our great river received three principal\r\ntributaries--the Red River of the South, the Washita, and the Arkansas,\r\neach flowing in valleys from two to ten miles in width, but now\r\nrepresented only by the depauperated streams meandering from side to\r\nside, over the flat bottom lands, generally bounded by bluffs.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi from the east received no important tributaries south\r\nof the Ohio; such rivers as the Yazoo being purely modern and wandering\r\nabout in the ancient filled-up valley as does the modern Mississippi\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nSo far we find that the Mississippi below the mouth of the Ohio differed\r\nfrom the modern river in its enormous magnitude and direct course.\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of the Ohio to that of the Minnesota River, at Fort\r\nSnelling, the characteristics of the Mississippi Valley differ entirely\r\nfrom those of the lower sections. It generally varies from two to ten\r\nmiles in width, and is bounded almost everywhere by bluffs, which\r\nvary in height from 150 to 500 feet, cut through by the entrances of\r\noccasional tributaries.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the ancient channel is often 100 feet or more below the\r\npresent river, which wanders about, from side to side, over the \"bottom\r\nlands\" of the old valley, now partly filled with debris, brought down by\r\nthe waters themselves, and deposited since the time when the pitch of\r\nthe river began to be diminished. There are two places where the river\r\nflows over hard rock. These are at the rapids near the mouth of the Des\r\nMoines River, and a little farther up, at Rock Island. These portions of\r\nthe river do not represent the ancient courses, for subsequent to the\r\nGreat River Age, according to General Warren, the old channels became\r\nclosed, and the modern river, being deflected, was unable to reopen its\r\nold bed.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri River is now the only important tributary of this section\r\nof the Mississippi from the west. Like the western tributaries, farther\r\nsouth, it meanders over broad bottom lands, which in some places reach a\r\nwidth of ten miles or more, bounded by bluffs. During the period of the\r\nculmination, it probably discharged nearly as much water as the Upper\r\nMississippi. At that time there were several other tributaries of no\r\nmean size, such as the Des Moines, which filled valleys, one or two\r\nmiles wide, but now represented only by shrunken streams.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting portion of our study refers to the ancient eastern\r\ntributaries, and the head waters of the great river.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the Ohio River flows over bottom lands, less\r\nextensive than those of the west, although bounded by high bluffs.\r\nThe bed of the ancient valley is now buried to a depth of sometimes a\r\nhundred feet or more. However, at Louisville, Ky., the river flows over\r\nhard rock, the ancient valley having been filled with river deposits on\r\nwhich that city is built, as shown first by Dr. Newberry, similar to the\r\nclosing of the old courses of the Mississippi, at Des Moines Rapids and\r\nRock Island. However, the most wonderful changes in the course of the\r\nOhio are further up the river. Mr. Carll, of Pennsylvania, in 1880,\r\ndiscovered that the Upper Alleghany formerly emptied into Lake Erie, and\r\nthe following year I pointed out that not only the Upper Alleghany, but\r\nthe whole Upper Ohio, formerly emptied into Lake Erie, by the Beaver and\r\nMahoning Valleys (reversed), and the Grand River (of Ohio). Therefore,\r\nonly that portion of the Ohio River from about the Pennsylvania-Ohio\r\nState line sent its waters to the Mexican Gulf, during the Great River\r\nAge.\r\n\r\nOther important differences in the river geology of our country were\r\nLake Superior emptying directly into the northern end of Lake Michigan,\r\nand Lake Michigan discharging itself, somewhere east of Chicago, into an\r\nupper tributary of the Illinois River. Even now, by removing rock to a\r\ndepth of ten feet, some of the waters of Lake Michigan have been made to\r\nflow into the Illinois, which was formerly a vastly greater river than\r\nat present, for the ancient valley was from two to ten miles wide, and\r\nvery deep, though now largely filled with drift.\r\n\r\n_The study of the Upper Ancient Mississippi_ is the most important of\r\nthis address. The principal discoveries were made only a few years\r\nsince, by General G.K. Warren, of the Corps of Engineers, U.S.A. At Ft.\r\nSnelling, a short distance above St. Paul, the modern Minnesota River\r\nempties into the Mississippi, but the ancient condition was the\r\nconverse. At Ft. Snelling, the valleys form one continuous nearly\r\nstraight course, about a mile wide, bounded by bluffs 150 feet high. The\r\nvalley of the Minnesota is large, but the modern river is small. The\r\nuppermost valley of the Mississippi enters this common valley at nearly\r\nright angles, and is only a quarter of a mile wide and is completely\r\nfilled by the river. Though this body of water is now the more\r\nimportant, yet in former days it was relatively a small tributary.\r\n\r\nThe character of the Minnesota Valley is similar to that of the\r\nMississippi below Ft. Snelling, in being bounded by high bluffs and\r\nhaving a width of one or two miles, or more, all the way to the height\r\nof land, between Big Stone Lake and Traverse Lake, the former of which\r\ndrains to the south, from an elevation of 992 feet above the sea, and\r\nthe latter only half a dozen miles distant (and eight feet higher)\r\nempties, by the Red River of the North, into Lake Winnipeg. During\r\nfreshets, the swamps between these two lakes discharge waters both ways.\r\nThe valley of the Red River is really the bed of an immense dried-up\r\nlake. The lacustrine character of the valley was recognized by early\r\nexplorers, but all honor to the name of General Warren, who, in\r\nobserving that the ancient enormous Lake Winnipeg formerly sent its\r\nwaters southward to the Mexican Gulf, made the most important discovery\r\nin fluviatile geology--a discovery which will cause his name to be\r\nhonored in the scientific world long after his professional successes\r\nhave been forgotten.\r\n\r\nGeneral Warren considered that the valley of Lake Winnipeg only belonged\r\nto the Mississippi since the \"Ice Age,\" and explained the changes of\r\ndrainage of the great north by the theory of the local elevation of the\r\nland. Facts which settle this question have recently been collected in\r\nMinnesota State by Mr. Upham, although differently explained by that\r\ngeologist. However, he did not go far enough back in time, for doubtless\r\nthe Winnipeg Valley discharged southward before the last days of the\r\n\"Ice Age,\" and the great changes in the river courses were not entirely\r\nproduced by local elevation, but also by the filling of the old water\r\nchannels with drift deposits and sediments. Throughout the bottom of the\r\nRed River Valley a large number of wells have been sunk to great depths,\r\nand these show the absence of hard rock to levels below that of Lake\r\nWinnipeg; but some portions of the Minnesota River flow over hard rock\r\nat levels somewhat higher. Whether the presence of these somewhat higher\r\nrocks is due entirely to the local elevation, which we know took place,\r\nor to the change in the course of the old river, remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nMr. Upham has also shown that there is a valley connecting the Minnesota\r\nRiver, at Great Bend at Mankato, with the head waters of the Des Moines\r\nRiver, as I predicted to General Warren a few months before his death.\r\nAt the time when Lake Winnipeg was swollen to its greatest size,\r\nextending southward into Minnesota, as far as Traverse Lake, it had a\r\nlength of more than 600 miles and a breadth of 250 miles.\r\n\r\nIts greatest tributary was the Saskatchewan--a river nearly as large as\r\nthe Missouri. It flowed in a deep broad cañon now partly filled with\r\ndrift deposits, in some places, to two hundred feet or more in depth.\r\n\r\nAnother tributary, but of a little less size, was the Assiniboine, now\r\nemptying into the Red River, at the city of Winnipeg. Following up\r\nthis river, in a westerly direction, one passes into the Qu'Appelle\r\nValley--the upper portion of which is now filled with drift, as first\r\nshown by Prof. H. Y. Hind. This portion of the valley is interesting,\r\nfor through it, before being filled with drift, the south branch of the\r\nSaskatchewan River formerly flowed, and constituted an enormous river.\r\nBut subsequent to the Great River Age, when choked with drift, it sent\r\nits waters to the North Saskatchewan as now seen. There were many other\r\nchanges in the course of the ancient rivers to the north, but I cannot\r\nhere record them.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the ancient Mississippi and its tributaries were vastly\r\nlarger rivers than their modern representatives. At the close of the\r\nGreat River Age, the whole continent subsided to many hundred feet below\r\nits present level, or some portions to even thousands of feet. During\r\nthis subsidence, the Mississippi States north of the Ozark Mountains\r\nformed the bed of an immense lake, into the quiet waters of which were\r\ndeposited soils washed down by the various rivers from the northwestern\r\nand north central States and the northern territories of Canada. These\r\nsediments, brought here from the north, constitute the bluff formation\r\nof the State, and are the source of the extraordinary fertility of our\r\nlands, on which the future greatness of our State depends. However, time\r\nwill not permit me to enter into the application of the facts brought\r\nforward to agricultural interests. But although this address is intended\r\nto be in the realm of pure science, I cannot refrain from saying a word\r\nto our engineering students as to the application of knowledge of river\r\ngeology to their future work. The subject of river geology is yet in its\r\ninfancy, and I have known of much money being squandered for want of\r\nits knowledge. In one case, I saved a company several thousand dollars,\r\nthough I should have been willing to give a good subscription to see the\r\nwork carried out from the scientific point of view.\r\n\r\nI will briefly indicate a few interesting points to the engineer.\r\nSometimes in making railway cuttings it is possible to find an adjacent\r\nburied valley through which excavations can be made without cutting hard\r\nrock. In bridge building especially, in the western country, a knowledge\r\nof the buried valleys is of the utmost importance. Again, in sinking for\r\ncoal do not begin your work from the bed of a valley, unless it be of\r\nhard rock, else you may have to go through an indefinite amount of drift\r\nand gravel; and once more, in boring for artesian wells, it sometimes\r\nhappens that good water can be obtained in the loose drift filling these\r\nancient valleys; but when you wish to sink into harder rock, do not\r\nselect your site of operations on an old buried valley, for the cost of\r\nsinking through gravel is greater than through ordinary rock.\r\n\r\nIn closing, let us consider to what the name Mississippi should be\r\ngiven. In point of antiquity, the Ohio and Upper Mississippi are of\r\nabout the same age, but since the time when ingrowing southward they\r\nunited, the latter river has been the larger. The Missouri River,\r\nthough longer than the Mississippi, is both smaller and geographically\r\nnewer--the upper portion much newer.\r\n\r\nAbove Ft. Snelling, the modern Mississippi, though the larger body of\r\nwater, should be considered as a tributary to that now called Minnesota,\r\nwhile the Minnesota Valley is really a portion of the older Mississippi\r\nValley--both together forming the parent river, which when swollen to\r\nthe greatest volume had the Saskatchewan River for a tributary,\r\nand formed the grandest and mightiest river of which we have any\r\nrecord.--_Kansas City Review_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA catalogue, containing brief notices of many important scientific\r\npapers heretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at this\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nTERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION, $5 A YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the United\r\nStates or Canada.
