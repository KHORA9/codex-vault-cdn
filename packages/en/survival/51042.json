C.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: On the road to the Caves—Ross Peak in centre.]\r\n\r\n                         DOMINION PARKS BRANCH\r\n                       Department of the Interior\r\n                                 OTTAWA\r\n                                  1914\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE NAKIMU CAVES\r\n                      GLACIER DOMINION PARK, B.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the summit of the Selkirk range of mountains in British Columbia is\r\none of the most curious series of subterranean caves in the world. Being\r\nof recent discovery and, up to the present, almost inaccessible except\r\nto the most agile and daring they remain practically unknown to the\r\nworld at large, but to those bold spirits who have dared their black\r\ndepths they have offered an experience, weird, thrilling and wonderful.\r\nLess than a thousand visitors at present make the journey to the Caves\r\neach year.\r\n\r\nTo the graphic description of Arthur O. Wheeler, president and founder\r\nof the Canadian Alpine Club, together with the report of W. S. Ayres,\r\nthe mining engineer who was commissioned by this department to report on\r\nthe Caves, the substance of this pamphlet is indebted.\r\n\r\nThe Dominion Government is at present having work done which will render\r\naccessible to the public this unusual and somewhat gruesome curiosity. A\r\ngood road is already built between the little alplike town of Glacier to\r\nwithin 6,000 feet of the Caves and a trail connects this point with the\r\nentrance. The distance is about seven miles by saddle pony from the\r\nbeautiful Canadian Pacific Railway hotel at Glacier to the end of the\r\nroad, and the whole journey can be finished on foot in five hours. The\r\nride is through scenes almost incomparable, perhaps even in the Rocky or\r\nSelkirk mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Yoho valley, in which flows the Cougar Creek, in the bed of which\r\nare the Caves, possesses magnificent vistas of varied mountain scenery.\r\nTo quote Wheeler:—“It is difficult to express the wonder of the colour\r\ncontrasts that meet the eye in the ever changing panorama of snow-clad\r\npeak, rock precipice dazzling névé, shining glacier ice and bronze-green\r\nforest of pines, midst which nestle magic lakes of changing shades of\r\nblue and green.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wheeler remarks that the Cougar valley, in the bed of which are the\r\nCaves, is of special interest for two reasons other than the Caves:—\r\n\r\n1. “It is of that special type known as ‘a hanging valley,’ or one that\r\nhas been carved out in a U-shaped cross-section by the action of glacial\r\nerosion, and not in the form of a V, as would have occurred through the\r\naction of water erosion alone. It is, moreover, a very pronounced form\r\nof its type. The numerous small glaciers that still line the sides and\r\nhead of the valley give it exceeding great beauty and interest in summer\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n2. “I know of no other spot in the Selkirks where alpine flora is more\r\nabundant and varied, and this fact alone is an attraction not to be\r\ndespised.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                Description of the Valley of the Caves,\r\n                           by A. O. Wheeler.\r\n\r\n“The valley of Cougar creek is divided into two parts of distinctly\r\ndifferent characteristics. The upper valley, a great spoon-shaped basin\r\nextending from Lookout point to Cougar pass, is a most pronounced form\r\nof the type known as ‘hanging valley,’ or one that has been carved out\r\nin a U-shaped cross section by the eroding power of a glacier at one\r\ntime filling up its bottom. This glacier has now shrunk to very small\r\nproportions at the extreme head of the valley. The floor is on a\r\ncomparatively low grade and, at one point, is covered for about half a\r\nmile by a small lake-bed in which some water lies during the summer. The\r\nentire length of the upper valley may be put at 2½ miles. It is inclosed\r\nby the rocky steeps of Mount Bagheera, Catamount peak and Mount Ursus\r\nMajor, on the north, and of Cougar mountain on the south. On the sides\r\nof these massives are small glaciers, busy at work tearing down the\r\nentire structures. At the head of the valley, Cougar pass leads across\r\nthe shrunken glacier to a steep ravine descending to the railway at some\r\ndistance below Ross Peak station.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: On the road to the Caves—Showing Cougar Valley; Mts.\r\n                 Ursus Major and Bagheera in distance.]\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: Douglas Falls—Near the Caves.]\r\n\r\n“It would be difficult to find a more beautiful example of the alpine\r\nvalley. In every direction silver water-falls leap down the sides from\r\nthe glaciers and melting snows of the surrounding peaks. These collect\r\nat the bottom of the valley in one central stream which bounds in\r\nfoaming cascades to the little lake-bed mentioned above. It leaves this,\r\nand, continually augmented by falls from above, rushes through luxurious\r\nmeadow-lands in a second series of cascades that have worn down to\r\nbedrock, showing where a thin veneer of soil is overlaying it. The\r\nalpine meadows and park-lands, as well as the open mountain slopes of\r\nthe valley, are throughout the spring and summer decked with a gorgeous\r\narray of flowers of varied hues which, in places, are so profuse and\r\nbrilliant that it seems as though nature had spread a carpet of rainbow\r\ncolours for the delight and wonder of her visitors. In early spring, the\r\ngiant Adder’s Tongue (_Erythronium gigantium_) covers whole acres with a\r\nbrilliant yellow. These flowers are the first, and may be seen pushing\r\ntheir heads up through the snow. Like all spring flowers in this region,\r\nthey follow the melting snows, and may be found higher up in the valley\r\nas late as August. Almost coincident with them is the Globe flower\r\n(_Trollius laxus_), a plant of much beauty and great wealth of blossom.\r\nNext come the scarlet and crimson Painter’s Brush (_Castilleia_),\r\nshowing everywhere in the open and on the lower slopes with a blaze of\r\nglory. Later still, the blue Larkspur (_Delphinium bicolor_) and purple\r\nand pink Asters replace the earlier series, the crimson and yellow\r\nMonkey-flower (_Mimulus_) are found in the beds of the streams and where\r\nmoisture is prevalent; high up in the valley and on the alp-lands below\r\nthe rocks are seen the False Heaths (_Bryanthus_ and _Cassiope_) and,\r\nhighest of all, the pink-flowering moss (_Silene acaulis_), found in\r\nmagnificently flowered bunches directly below the ice. There are very\r\nmany other species more rare, and just as beautiful in blossom, but of\r\nnot so frequent or noticeable occurrence.\r\n\r\n“The timber consists, in this upper valley, chiefly of spruce and\r\nbalsam, trees which, at this elevation, in the Selkirks attain a grace\r\nand beauty that is not noticed in the more crowded areas of lower\r\naltitudes. Here they rise symmetrically to a great height, and their\r\nsweeping lower boughs form shaded canopies that are most inviting during\r\nthe sultry summer weather.\r\n\r\n“As the head of the valley is approached, a short climb will convey the\r\nexplorer to the ice of several small glaciers where he may study with\r\nease their formation and action, look into miniature crevasses and see\r\nhow moraines of rock detritus are formed by the downward flow of the\r\nice.\r\n\r\n“At the site of the Caves, Cougar Creek valley turns from a\r\nnortheasterly to a southeasterly direction, and falls sharply 2,000 feet\r\nfrom Lookout point to the tank, as compared with 1,200 feet for the\r\nupper valley in the same distance, about two miles. The lower valley is\r\nV-shaped and has, for the most part, been carved out by the action of\r\nwater erosion. The sides except immediately adjacent to the railway are\r\ntimbered only in patches and are for the most part covered by closely\r\ngrowing alders, bracken and rank grass which have replaced the timber\r\nwhere the slopes have been swept clear by avalanches from the heights\r\nabove. Through the latter half of this section of the valley the stream\r\nflows in a narrow canyon and the fall is steep. As soon as the corner is\r\nturned and the slopes of the Illecillewaet valley reached, a magnificent\r\nforest growth of Douglas fir (_Pseudotsuga Douglasii_), hemlock (_Tsuga\r\nMertensiana_), cedar (_Thuga gigantea_), and a few scattered trees of\r\nwhite pine (_Pinus strobus_) is passed through.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: Goat Falls—Near the entrance to the Caves.]\r\n\r\n“From a natural history point of view, the upper valley is exceptional,\r\ndue largely to the absence of visitors in the past. The Rocky Mountain\r\ngoat (_Haplocerus montanus_) may be seen frequently, and his tracks are\r\neverywhere along the heights. During one of our visits a grizzly bear\r\n(_Ursus ferox_) was killed by Deutschman. The black bear (_Ursus\r\namericana_) is plentiful at the head of bear creek across Baloo pass,\r\nand it may be safely assumed that he does not fail to visit Cougar\r\nvalley. Of the smaller mammals, the hoary marmot or whistler (_Arctomys\r\nColumbianus_) is plentiful in both the upper and lower valley, and is\r\nhere found in large numbers, larger in size and giving forth a louder\r\nand more shrill whistle than in the main range of the Rockies. Its\r\nstartling note is very human and resembles much the noise that delights\r\nthe heart of the small boy, produced by placing the fingers between the\r\nlips. Say’s squirrel (_Spermophilus lateralis_) and Parry’s marmot\r\n(_Spermophilus Parryi_) are also found, the latter in great numbers. The\r\nLittle Chief hare (_Logomys princeps_) is frequently seen disporting\r\nitself among the rocks, and its comical antics and quaint squeak,\r\nresembling that of a toy rabbit, are very amusing.\r\n\r\n“The birds are few, and in the upper valley are chiefly confined to the\r\nPtarmigan (_Lagopus leucurus_), of which a flock may nearly always be\r\nseen, the water ousel or dipper (_Cinclus Mexicanus_), a funny little\r\ndark grey chap who flits from stone to stone along the cascades and\r\nfalls of the valley, continually bobbing and dipping as though it were\r\nthe object and aim of his existence. This bird has a very sweet note. Of\r\nother birds the black-headed jay (_Cyanocitta stelleri annectens_) and\r\nthe Rocky Mountain Whisky Jack (_Perisoreus Canadensis capitalis_) are\r\nthe most apparent.\r\n\r\n“Taken as a whole, this wonderful valley is worthy of a visit quite\r\nindependently of the attractions offered by the Caves, and it would be\r\ndifficult to find a more representative or better type of valley to\r\nillustrate the various phases of nature in the Selkirks—scenery,\r\ngeology, natural history and botany.”\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1904 that Charles Henry Deutschman of Revelstoke, a\r\nBritish subject, while prospecting and hunting big game, discovered the\r\nCaves in series.\r\n\r\nThe next person to enter the Caves after Deutschman was A. Johnston,\r\neditor of the Revelstoke _Mail-Herald_. Next, in May, 1905, a party of\r\ntwelve persons, including W. S. Ayres, the mining engineer, Howard\r\nDouglas, superintendent of Rocky Mountains Park, and R. B. Bennett, the\r\nAssociated Press correspondent at Vancouver and now member of the\r\nDominion House representing Calgary, visited the Caves. Most of this\r\nparty, however, returned to Glacier on the following day and left\r\nMessrs. Ayres, Deutschman, Johnston, Benson and Field to make further\r\nexplorations.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: On the road to the Caves—Mt. Avalanche, Eagle Peak, Mt.\r\n                              Sir Donald.]\r\n\r\n\r\n              Mr. Ayres’ Description of this Exploration.\r\n\r\n“On the morning of May 30, the entire party entered the cave by the\r\nopening which I have designated on the map as ‘Entrance No. 1.’ Pools of\r\nwater more or less filled with ice were encountered, which greatly\r\nimpeded our progress, and finally a very deep one, at a distance of 237\r\nfeet from the surface, barred further progress until a raft could be\r\nprepared. Retracing our steps to the surface we sought an entrance in\r\n‘The Canyon’ by means of a rope. This passage was about 70 feet below\r\nthe natural surface and about 100 feet above the bottom of ‘The Canyon,’\r\nwas very small and blocked with ice. I have designated this opening as\r\n‘Entrance No. 2,’ on the map.\r\n\r\n“Another opening was found which is recorded as ‘Entrance No. 3.’ Here,\r\nby crawling through a very narrow passage on hands and knees and then\r\ndescending a steep narrow water groove for about 50 feet the brink of a\r\nvery large cavern was reached that was estimated to be 256 feet deep,\r\nbut its length and breadth were, owing to their great extent and to the\r\ninsufficiency of lights at hand, inaccessible. It was observable,\r\nhowever, that several openings led off from this great cavern. The\r\nplunge and roar of a great waterfall somewhere down in the depths of\r\nthis cavern reverberates in every inch of space, and produces in the\r\nlistener sensations so weird that even those that have elsewhere met its\r\ncounterpart are at first startled.\r\n\r\n“No further attempt was made at this time to explore the cave through\r\nthis entrance for the reason that the three hundred feet of rope sent by\r\nMr. Ford, resident engineer of the C.P.R., for our use, had not yet been\r\nbrought up to the cave from the water tank. On the following day another\r\nobstacle presented itself. The rapidly melting snow formed a sudden rush\r\nof water which poured down the mountain side and into this opening, and\r\nmade it not only inaccessible for the time being, but proved it to be\r\npositively dangerous to enter for any extended explorations until the\r\nsnow has practically disappeared.\r\n\r\n“On the afternoon of May 31, and the forenoon of June 1, a raft and\r\nadditional ladders were constructed to cross over the large pool that\r\nimpeded our progress on May 30 in ‘Entrance No. 1.’ While we were eating\r\nour noon meal on the 31st, Cougar creek overflowed into this entrance.\r\nWe made the attempt to descend but were drenched with water, and our\r\nlights were put out. We constructed a dam to prevent this, as far as\r\npossible, and at 6 a.m. on June 2 we again descended into the cave by\r\nthis entrance, and found at a distance of 331 feet from the surface a\r\nlarge square chamber, 50 feet wide by 60 feet, that was accessible. A\r\nlarge portion of its length was inaccessible owing to Cougar creek,\r\nwhich flows across it, and to accumulated ice. We named this chamber\r\n‘The Auditorium.’\r\n\r\n“At a point in the main entrance just as we emerge from ‘The\r\nAuditorium,’ a branch passage was found which again joins the main\r\nentrance about 100 feet from the surface. This branch passage is marked\r\non the map as A-B. Another branch passage was found to connect this\r\nentrance with the surface and it is designated on the map as B-C. A\r\ndiligent search in this part of the cave disclosed no other accessible\r\nopenings.\r\n\r\n“A descent by ropes to the bottom of the canyon at ‘Entrance No. 2’ was\r\nconsidered but it was deemed entirely unsafe, owing to the very large\r\naccumulated mass of snow which might slide into it at any moment, and\r\nwithout warning. Besides this, no entry can be made until Cougar creek\r\nhas subsided to a mere brook.\r\n\r\n“The falls, designated on the map as ‘Lower Goat Falls,’ were visited\r\nwith the hope that an entrance might be effected to the very large\r\ncavern by the passage through which the water from the fall enters; but\r\nit was practically filled with water and ice. The falls consist of two\r\nvertical drops, the upper one is about 30 feet and the lower one 50\r\nfeet. A large amount of water is delivered into the cave from these\r\nfalls, the place of entry being immediately at its foot. It is called\r\n‘Entrance No. 4.’\r\n\r\n“No other openings were discovered by which access might be had to the\r\nlarge cavern, and we are barred from entering it by those openings\r\nalready described, and for the reasons given, until such time as the\r\nspring floods may have fully subsided.”\r\n\r\nMr. A. O. Wheeler, D.L.S., accompanied by Deutschman, was the next\r\nexplorer, and the following is Mr. Wheeler’s description of their\r\nexperiences in the new caves which were discovered during this visit:—\r\n\r\n\r\n        Mr. Wheeler’s Exploration and Description of the Caves.\r\n\r\n“Up to this time, only the Gopher Bridge series and the Mill Bridge\r\nseries (see map) had been explored. It was not until a day or two before\r\nthe close of the survey, August 4, that an attempt was made to penetrate\r\nthe huge opening seen at the north end of the bottom of the gorge. On\r\nthe date named, the writer descended by means of a knotted rope, and was\r\nfollowed by Deutschman. The stream was then at high water, and pouring\r\ninto the opening with a tremendous rush and swirl of waters. Although\r\nthe creek was crossed by wading waist deep in the icy torrent, it was\r\nfound impossible to penetrate more than a couple of hundred feet into\r\nthe depth. Later in the month Deutschman, alone and unaided, penetrated\r\nthis opening and worked his way across the stream, discovering what is\r\nnow referred to as the Gorge series, or the series of passageways\r\nreached by the opening from the Gorge. And here the writer begs to say a\r\nword or two concerning this remarkable man. The work of exploration he\r\nhas done without assistance, shows a character utterly devoid of fear.\r\nThe descent into depths of blackest darkness, lighted only by the dim\r\nrays of a tallow dip, without a rope or other aid except in a case of\r\ndirest necessity, requires more than courage; it requires strength of\r\npurpose and power of will far beyond the ordinary degree. For, added to\r\nthe thick darkness, there was always the fierce vibrating roar of\r\nsubterranean torrents, a sound most nerve shaking in a position\r\nsufficiently uncanny and demoralizing without it. Huge cracks had to be\r\ncrossed, and precipitous descents made in pitch darkness, where, it is\r\nsafe to say, a misstep would have instant death, either suddenly or\r\nthrough disablement. Now that ladders are placed and ropes set, and the\r\nsure path pointed out by this intrepid guide, it is difficult to realize\r\nhow in the first place the passage could possibly have been made\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Typical Alpland—On Mt. Abbott about 1 mile south of\r\n                               Glacier.]\r\n\r\n“The first visitor after Deutschman to the Gorge series was a Mr. Lang,\r\nof Golden, B.C., who very nearly met with a serious accident when\r\nclimbing up the rope from the bottom of the gorge to the floor of the\r\nvalley, 80 feet above. He had nearly reached the top when his strength\r\ngave out, and he slid back down the rope, arriving at the bottom in a\r\nmuch bruised condition, but fortunately with no bones broken.”\r\n\r\nMr. Wheeler furnishes a splendid detail description of the various\r\nseries of caves, and it is thought well to reproduce this description\r\n_in extenso_:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Gopher Bridge Series.\r\n\r\n“On leaving the lake-bed above mentioned, Cougar creek flows in a series\r\nof cascades for a little more than half a mile through open alpine\r\nmeadowland, broken here and there by knolls crowned with scrubby spruce.\r\nSuddenly, without warning, it drops into a cavity and, 450 feet farther\r\ndown, quietly issues from its underground way. During this disappearance\r\nthe stream has only dropped 30 feet. The intervening space between the\r\nentry into and exit from the ground has been named ‘Gopher Bridge’ by\r\nthe first party visiting the Caves, owing to the large numbers of\r\nParry’s marmot, which much resembles a gopher, to be seen in the\r\nimmediate vicinity, and the underlying passages are here referred to as\r\nthe Gopher Bridge series. Directly opposite the disappearance of the\r\ncreek, two striking cascades tumble down the mountain side and uniting,\r\nflow for a short space parallel to Cougar creek; then, vanishing into a\r\nhole in the ground, they join the main stream by a subterranean passage.\r\nThey are known as ‘Gopher Falls,’ and the place where they disappear as\r\nthe ‘Gopher Hole’ (see map of Caves).\r\n\r\n“The Gopher Bridge series of passageways was at first entered by the\r\nopening shown on the map as ‘Old Entrance.’ It was a very disagreeable\r\noperation, entailing much wriggling and squeezing through narrow cracks\r\nover dirty rocks. Eventually, a point of vantage was reached directly\r\nover the subterranean torrent. At the time of the first exploration the\r\nwriter took acetylene bicycle lamps, whose bull’s-eyes enabled the pitch\r\ndarkness to be pierced to some extent. Magnesium wire also was lighted,\r\nand, by its aid, for a brief minute, the interior was bathed in dazzling\r\nbrightness. Standing on a narrow ledge that overhangs a black abyss, the\r\neye is first drawn by a subterranean waterfall heard roaring immediately\r\non the left. It appears to pour from a dark opening above it. Below,\r\nbetween black walls of rock, may be seen the foam-flecked torrent\r\nhurtling down the incline until lost in sense shadows. Overhead,\r\nfantastic spurs and shapes reach out into the blackness and the entire\r\nsurroundings are so weird and uncanny that it is easy to imagine Dante\r\nseated upon one of these spurs deriving impressions for his inferno. As\r\nthe brilliant light goes out the thick darkness makes itself felt, and\r\ninstinctively you feel to see if Charon is not standing beside you. This\r\nsubterranean stream, with its unearthly surroundings, is somewhat\r\nsuggestive of the Styx, and incidentally supplied the name ‘Avernus’ for\r\nthe cavern of the waterfall.\r\n\r\n“At one time the stream entered by this opening, but a natural dam has\r\ngradually been formed causing it to find a new opening at the spot where\r\nit is now shown disappearing on the map. About midway between the\r\nentrance of the creek and the old entrance, Deutschman has excavated a\r\nsmall natural opening to a size sufficiently large enough to admit an\r\naverage person with comfort. A small passage joins with the underground\r\nway of the creek, and by following along its edge you eventually come to\r\nthe point of vantage previously described. _En route_, several small\r\nchambers are passed, originally carved out of the rock in the form of\r\npotholes by the swirl and swish of the waters, but since much distorted\r\nin shape owing to disintegration of the cleavage planes. The spot is\r\nunique and wonderful, and the sensations it produces eerie in the\r\nextreme. It is well worthy of a visit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: On the road 2 miles from Glacier—Ross Peak in distance.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Mill Bridge Series.\r\n\r\n“On making its exit at the eastern end of Gopher Bridge, Cougar creek\r\npours down a narrow rock-cut for a distance of 350 feet, when it again\r\ndisappears in a whirl of flying spray below the surface of the valley.\r\nIt reappears, 300 feet farther on at the bottom of a deep gorge, having\r\ndropped 85 feet while underground. The interval between the exit and\r\nentrance has been named Mill bridge by the party previously mentioned,\r\non account of the roar of the water as it rushes underground through the\r\nchoked entrance, resembling the noise made by a big mill in full\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n“The rock-cut above referred to is narrow, about 8 to 10 feet wide, and\r\nof regular appearance. The upper half presents a series of cascades and\r\nfalls, and the sides show curious small potholes that are in the process\r\nof erosion from the soft limestone. It has been named ‘The Flume,’ owing\r\nto its resemblance to a millrace. There are several openings at the\r\npoint where the creek disappears, and its last spectacular leap as it\r\nvanishes underground is very striking. 70 feet farther east is a larger\r\nopening, at one time the point where the stream disappeared, but as the\r\nrush of water cut deeper in the rock channel it took advantage of a\r\nhandy crack and gradually carved out for itself the opening where the\r\nfull volume now descends.\r\n\r\n“About the centre of the flume, on the eastern side, and 30 feet from\r\nit, is the entrance to the Mill Bridge series of the caves, shown on the\r\nmap as ‘Entrance No. 1.’ This entrance is a mere cleft in the rock\r\nstrata, and is only wide enough to admit of the passage of a man’s body.\r\nThe total length of the underground passageway, at one time\r\naccommodating a very considerable volume of water, is 400 feet. The\r\nheight varies from a minimum of 10 feet to a maximum of 25 feet, and the\r\nwidth from 3 to 15 feet. At its eastern end it opens to an\r\nirregularly-shaped chamber of approximately 60 by 70 feet, with a\r\ngreatest height of 20 feet. This chamber has been named ‘The Auditorium’\r\nby the first exploring party. Cougar creek in its flow beneath Mill\r\nbridge passes through the Auditorium, and as it falls 75 feet in a\r\ndistance of 200 feet, from its entrance beneath Mill bridge to the\r\nAuditorium, the chamber is replete with its roar, and the name is\r\nappropriate, though hardly in the conventional sense of the word. Faint\r\ndaylight enters through the passageway of the waters and serves to make\r\nthe surroundings look dim and mysterious. The frosts of winter also\r\nreach this spot, and in the spring stalactites and stalagmites, formed\r\nof huge icicles, are seen in columnar groups surrounding the dashing\r\nwaters and extending some distance into the chamber itself. In this\r\nparticular spot disintegration has created much havoc and the walls no\r\nlonger show the marks of water erosion, while the floor is heaped with\r\nrock debris fallen from the ceiling. The passageway, however, that\r\nconnects it with the surface is still intact as a sample of the power of\r\nwater erosion. It is composed of a series of potholes, connected one\r\nwith the other by short narrow passages. The bottom of each succeeding\r\npothole, as you recede from the entrance, is at a lower elevation,\r\nsometimes as much as ten or fifteen feet. To make access possible,\r\nDeutschman has, with the assistance of a bridge carpenter loaned by T.\r\nKilpatrick, superintendent of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company at\r\nRevelstoke, placed rough ladders from floor to floor. Most of these\r\npotholes hold water in the hollows at the bottom, and, in one case, the\r\nwater is so deep—4 or 5 feet—and the potholes so wide that a floating\r\nbridge had to be built. When it is realized that every bit of timber\r\nused in these constructions had to be hewn from the tree and transported\r\non the shoulder or back, over a road hardly accessible for a mountain\r\ngoat, to the place where it was utilized, some idea of the magnitude of\r\nthe work can be formed.\r\n\r\n“At one spot the passageway twists in a loop, and here the potholes are\r\nof such a curiously spiral form that it has been named ‘The Corkscrew.’\r\nAcross this bend, about 12 feet above the main floor, a gallery extends\r\nfor 120 feet. It is of a similar pothole formation, but on a smaller\r\nscale than the main passageway. Directly below it, at the lower end, is\r\na peculiar sharp spike of rock that has evidently been subsequently\r\ncarved out by water pouring from this gallery, as is readily shown by\r\nthe erosionmarks on the component rocks. In addition to the lines of\r\nerosion on the rock spike and in the gallery pothole, honey-combing is\r\nseen on the right and high up on the left and, still farther on the\r\nleft, spatulated markings to the depth of half an inch, or a little\r\nover, which is a very common feature in all three series.\r\n\r\n“Throughout the Mill Bridge series, with the exception of the\r\nAuditorium, the floors and ceilings are of water-worn rock, and\r\npractically no debris has fallen away pointing to the fact that this\r\nchannel is of more recent origin, and the rock through which it has worn\r\nof a more compact stratification.\r\n\r\n“At one time it was reported that the roof of this passage was set with\r\nsparkling quartz crystals. It turned out, however, that they were only\r\ndrops of water that had collected through leakage or condensation. Some\r\nof the potholes are very curiously marked by thin incrustations of\r\ncarbonate of lime spreading over their concave surfaces in florescent\r\npatterns. Overhead in many places are seen projecting spurs that have\r\nwithstood the action of the water owing to superior hardness, or that,\r\nthrough some deflection of the current, have not had the same force\r\nbrought to bear upon them. The waters of Cougar creek are derived from\r\nthe melting glaciers and snow deposits lining the sides of the peaks\r\nenclosing the valley and, in consequence, carry a considerable quantity\r\nof sediment, composed of very fine rock particles. The quantity of\r\nsediment carried would, of course, be greatest when the stream was at\r\nflood stage. This sediment has doubtless been a factor of much\r\nimportance in the erosive power of the waters, and a residue may to-day\r\nbe seen as a very thin mud-coloured coating on the walls and floors of\r\nthe passageways, where it has been deposited by the subsiding waters. At\r\na very high stage of water in the creek there was an overflow into\r\nEntrance No. 1 that made the first exploration by W. S. Ayres and party\r\na wet and somewhat dangerous operation. This overflow, however, was\r\ndammed back by Deutschman, and no further trouble has since been\r\nexperienced with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The Gorge Series.\r\n\r\n“As stated above, the exit of Cougar creek from Mill bridge takes place\r\nat the bottom of a narrow crack, or gorge, running at right angles to\r\nthe general direction of the stream. The Gorge is 300 feet in length,\r\nabout 50 feet wide, and is spanned by two natural rock bridges. The\r\nsides are composed of badly shattered limestone. On emerging from its\r\nsubterranean course beneath Mill bridge, the creek flows through the\r\nGorge 80 feet below the floor of the valley. At the lower or north end\r\nis the opening that leads to the largest and most interesting of the\r\nseries of passageways forming the Nakimu Caves. The Gorge forms a very\r\nstriking feature of the external scenery, and several places are\r\naccessible from which views may be had into its depths that are wild and\r\nimpressive in the extreme. The opening is a dome-shaped break in the\r\nwall forming the north end. Into this the stream tumbles with wild fury\r\nover a confusion of huge fragments of rock piled up in the passageway.\r\nIt creates leaps and falls and a dissemination of spray that makes the\r\nopening to the outer world, as seen from below, appear through a\r\nluminous mist. The aperture is some thirty feet wide and about the same\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View from Road—Mt. Avalanche, Eagle Peak, Mt. Sir Donald.]\r\n\r\n“Proceeding downwards, at the foot of the falls, the channel resumes its\r\nnormal direction of a little south of east. It is necessary here to\r\ncross the stream, which swings northward into lower depths, and from now\r\non the passageways are quite free from wet, though somewhat damp from\r\nthe moistness of the Atmosphere. At the turn of the Creek’s direction\r\nyou enter a chamber 150 feet long, 25 feet wide and from 10 feet high at\r\nthe upper end to 30 feet at the lower end. This chamber is dimly\r\nilluminated by the daylight from outside. It is in a bad state of ruin,\r\nand the floor is heaped with debris thrown from the ceiling and sides.\r\nThe roof is composed of one immense slab of rock sloping with the dip of\r\nthe strata. The creek has broken through the northeast wall nearly in\r\nthe middle of the chamber and disappears into the blackness with a dull\r\nreverberating roar. Fifty feet beyond the creek, the passage turns north\r\nagain and it is necessary to descend a rock face of some 12 feet. On it\r\nare natural notches or footholds that would seem as though they had been\r\ncut with a cold-chisel for the special purpose; for persons unaccustomed\r\nto climbing, it is well to use a rope to steady the descent at this\r\nspot. The creek is now heard far down, welling through some rock-cut\r\nwith a dull, intermittent pounding, resembling the blows of an immense\r\nsledge-hammer. Forty feet to the right, through a low roofed passage\r\nabout 2 feet high, you creep into the ‘Dropping Cave.’ It is about 30 by\r\n40 feet and 6 to 10 feet high, and so named from the fact that water\r\ndrops from the roof in all directions. The floor is composed of broken\r\nrock fragments, and the walls and ceilings of dark blue limestone marked\r\nin places by irregular streaks of white crystalline calcite. At the\r\neastern end, a very narrow passage between fallen masses of rock,\r\naffording barely room to squeeze through, leads to ‘The Witches\r\nBall-room.’ It is 1½ to 2 feet wide, 3 to 4 feet high and some 20 feet\r\nin length.\r\n\r\n“The Ball-room is roughly triangular in shape with sides of about 60\r\nfeet, and an estimated height of 50 feet. The largest portion of the\r\nspace is occupied by an enormous rock that has fallen from the roof.\r\nThis rock has a generally level surface, and is just the spot where a\r\ngroup of witch-hags might be expected to caper round the ghastly fumes\r\nof some hellish cauldron at a Sabbath meeting; hence the name, in\r\nsympathy with the ill-omened and weird surroundings. On all sides,\r\nexcept that of the passage, are deep cracks partly choked up by fallen\r\nblocks but still exposing many deep and pitch-black holes leading to the\r\nunknown, where the underground stream is heard roaring dully. By one of\r\nthese, at the northeast corner of the chamber, W. S. Ayres and C. H.\r\nDeutschman penetrated to ‘The Terror’ and ‘The Old Mill,’ the former 60\r\nodd feet below the Ball-room. Their explorations in this quarter are\r\nshown on the accompanying map, in red, and a description of them will be\r\nfound in Mr. Ayres’ supplementary report. Many of the fallen blocks show\r\ncrystalline calcite markings similar to those found in the Dropping\r\nCave.\r\n\r\n“Leaving the Ball-room the passage leads southeasterly for a distance of\r\n125 feet to where there is a parting of the ways. The upper end is a\r\nvaulted chamber, 15 to 20 feet wide and about 20 feet high, a crack on\r\nthe left, leading to the depths below, has been partly filled by fallen\r\nrock debris. The broken blocks of which the floor is composed show\r\ncrystallized dark blue limestone, veined with white ribbons of calcite.\r\nFor the lower portion, the passage lies between separated limestone\r\nstrata from 3 to 7 feet apart; the floor, of broken boulders and slabs\r\nis very irregular. Both roof and floor are water-worn and show erosion\r\nmarkings. They descend until they meet 20 to 30 feet below. The\r\nsubterranean stream is heard with a muffled roar on the left. On the\r\nright, three passages, met at intervals, lead to two circular\r\nfunnel-like chambers, the more distant of which has been named ‘The\r\nPit.’\r\n\r\n“It is now necessary to return to the surface and seek ingress to the\r\ncaves by means of Entrance No. 3, not far from the Gorge on the eastern\r\nside. Entrance No. 3 is close by Lookout point and is the first\r\naccessible opening seen on the journey up the valley. A descent is made\r\nsome 10 or 12 feet by a rough ladder, placed by Deutschman, to a small\r\ncavern where there is just room for three persons to crouch. Off this, a\r\nvery narrow slit, through which it is barely possible to squeeze, opens\r\nto a narrow chute. Down this chute, by means of a rope placed around the\r\nbody, a descent can be made some 20 feet, to the brink of space. From\r\nthe final ledge a stone will drop a long way before it strikes. The\r\ntotal distance from the opening to the brink of the Pit is 60 feet.\r\n\r\n“When surveying the Gorge series, the writer discovered a very peculiar\r\npassage, shown on the map as the ‘Marbleway.’ It was of a perfectly\r\neroded structure, composed of a number of small connected potholes in a\r\ndark bluish-grey limestone, shot in every direction by ribbon streaks of\r\nwhite crystalline calcite. The walls were dripping with moisture and\r\nrendered the limestone dead black and the veins of calcite vivid white,\r\nthe whole resembling a rich glistening marble. This passage was followed\r\nto the larger one shown on the map, and that in turn to the circular\r\nchamber named ‘The Pit.’ It seemed probable that this was the spot where\r\nstones, dropped from the ledge attained by Entrance No. 3, first struck,\r\nso Deutschman was sent to reconnoitre and, not long afterwards, his face\r\ncould be seen near the extreme apex of the roof peering down through the\r\ndim halo of his tallow dip. A stone tied to a cord and subsequently\r\nmeasured showed the drop to the floor of the Pit to be 120 feet.\r\n\r\n“The chamber is about 20 feet in diameter and rises like a gigantic\r\nfunnel to something over the height named. The walls are similar to\r\nthose of the Marbleway, and some of the effects are very peculiar,\r\nreminding the beholder of forked lightning on a dead black background.\r\nAt the bottom of the Pit was seen a very queer slab of rock, shaped\r\nalmost perfectly like a monumental tombstone, and having directly in its\r\ncentre, as though carved by hand, a cross (+). The descent from the\r\nfloor of the Pit to the main passage, although slightly precipitous in\r\none or two places, is quite easy, the distance being 120 and 130 feet by\r\nthe main way and Marbleway, respectively. The walls of the Pit funnel\r\nare water-worn and, at one time, a stream flowed into it by Entrance No.\r\n3, doubtless being the cause of the formation of the chamber. The\r\nstream, which now only carries off the surplus flow from the melting\r\nsnows, has found another subterranean opening and joins Cougar creek in\r\nits underground way, somewhere beyond the Ball-room.\r\n\r\n“At the meeting of the ways above referred to, the lower or eastern one\r\nis named ‘The Slanting Way’ from the fact that the passage is formed by\r\na separation of the limestone strata, and lies across their dip. The\r\nupper passage has an arched roof and has been named ‘The Subway.’ Both\r\nare difficult to traverse: the former on account of the broken debris\r\nand sloping rock of which the floors are formed, and of two\r\nuncomfortably narrow places which can be squeezed through with\r\ndifficulty; the latter on account of the close proximity of floor and\r\nceiling and the necessity of bending nearly double for a considerable\r\npart of the distance while traversing it. The lower passage is the\r\neasier of the two. The strata forming the Slanting Way are from five to\r\nten feet apart. The slabs of both roof and floor are water-worn and bear\r\nspatulated erosion marks, like incipient honey-combing. On the east, or\r\nleft side, as you advance, are deep cracks in the strata, at the bottom\r\nof whose depths Cougar creek may be heard echoing loudly through the\r\nvaulted ways. Stones dropped into these seem to rebound for a long time\r\nbefore resting. About the centre of the Slanting Way the cracks in the\r\nstrata expand and a descent may be made to the bed of Cougar creek below\r\nthe Turbine. The Turbine is reached by a rather difficult passage\r\nrequiring some skill in climbing. The end of the passage is an irregular\r\nopening in the rock. Across a chasm, at whose bottom flows the main\r\nstream, a number of water-spouts rush out with great force and a noise\r\nresembling that produced by water falling into the pit of a turbine. For\r\nan account of this section see Ayres’ report. Near the south end of the\r\nSlanting Way is a curious pothole on the left-hand side. Directly beyond\r\nit the floor and walls are covered by an incrustation of carbonate of\r\nlime, varying in thickness from 2 to 6 inches. It is of a light creamy\r\ncolour, shading off in some places to a delicate salmon. The formation\r\nhas a florescent appearance and resembles, mostly, cauliflower heads set\r\nclosely together, a simile derived from W. S. Ayres’ report. Owing to\r\nthe beautiful floral decorations, this particular spot has been named\r\n‘The Art Gallery.’\r\n\r\n“Similar decorations are found throughout the Caves, though not so\r\nextensively as at this and a few other places. At some, there is only a\r\nthin veneer of the carbonate formation and, at others, rock-milk\r\n(_agaric mineral_) is seen on the floors and boulders. The writer did\r\nnot observe any stalagmites, nor any stalactites worth speaking of. The\r\nlongest did not exceed 15 inches, and resembled, more than anything\r\nelse, a thin icicle of that length; its chief interest being that it was\r\nclear and transparent, as though made of ice, and as brittle as glass.\r\n\r\n“The Subway is about 10 to 15 feet wide and from 7 to 2 feet high; the\r\nroof is arched and covered by moisture drops, which are very unpleasant\r\nwhen they find their way down your back. The floor is of broken rock,\r\nrising to a ridge along the centre of the passageway.\r\n\r\n“From the meeting of the ways, just beyond the Art Gallery, the passage\r\ncontinues southeasterly, ever increasing in interest. In the next 200\r\nfeet, it varies in width from 15 to 30 feet with a height of 10 to 15\r\nfeet. On the right is a narrow twisting side-opening named ‘The Gimlet.’\r\nOn the left are two concave sections of old potholes, leading into the\r\nmost subterranean depths. They are profusely decorated by florescent\r\ncarbonate incrustations, the first one being named ‘The Dome’ from its\r\nperfect formation. Minor passageways lead from them at a still greater\r\ndepth. The most southerly one connects with ‘Judgment Hall,’ to be\r\ndescribed further on (see map). In this section the underground course\r\nof Cougar creek crosses the corridor, at a considerable depth below, and\r\nthe roar of the hidden waters is transferred from the left to the right\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“A narrow opening, 1½ feet wide and 15 feet long, now leads to\r\n‘Carbonate Grotto’ where are seen very fine calcium decorations. The\r\nCavern containing the grotto is about 60 by 30 feet, with a height\r\nvarying from 10 to 15 feet. For the next 130 feet the passage varies\r\nfrom 8 feet wide and 5 feet high at the upper end to 20 feet wide and 5\r\nfeet high at the lower end. The sides are hung with rock shelves, and\r\nspotted with lime incrustations; the bottom is much impeded by fallen\r\nblocks. You now find yourself in a cul-de-sac and apparently at the end\r\nof the series. Not so, however, for by squeezing through a narrow\r\nopening on the right, barely noticeable in the darkness, you are enabled\r\nto descend to probably the largest cavern of all, at a depth of 57 feet\r\nbelow the corridor just left. The chamber, 200 feet long, 20 feet wide\r\nand 40 to 50 feet high has been named ‘Judgment Hall,’ on account of a\r\npillar which might stand for the pillar of justice. The floor is\r\nlittered by blocks broken from the roof and sides which lie piled in\r\ngreat heaps at the north end. The roof is roughly arched, and the sides\r\nrise upwards in parallel ledges resembling shelves. Roof, sides, and the\r\nrocks piled on the floor, are covered by the white calcite and, in many\r\nplaces, present most beautiful patterns and beds of florescent\r\nformations. The north end is connected by a rough passage with one of\r\nthe potholes referred to below the meeting of the ways.\r\n\r\n“Near the centre of the western wall, a narrow gap leads to a very\r\nbeautiful, though small, chamber named ‘The White Grotto’ by W. S.\r\nAyres. The carbonate decorations here are of great beauty and delicacy.\r\nThe passage in which the chamber is found is 40 feet long, 15 feet wide\r\nand 10 feet high. The final cave has been named the ‘Bridal Chamber’ by\r\nW. S. Ayres, owing to the purity of its lime draperies and the general\r\nbeauty of its floral decorations. It is small, and beyond this point\r\nexploration has not yet been carried. The passage breaks off in a\r\nprecipice falling to a deep chasm, at the bottom of which a subterranean\r\nstream, probably Cougar creek, may be heard.\r\n\r\n“This is the farthest point to which the present survey has been\r\ncarried. It is 240 feet from the Wind crack, previously referred to as\r\nbeing seen on the way up the valley, and is only 54 feet above it; it is\r\nsafe to assume that there is a connection between. The wind issuing from\r\nthe crack is probably due to a water blast caused by the subterranean\r\nstream falling into the chasm at the end of the exploration.\r\n\r\n“There are two other passages, or rather sets of passages, that have not\r\nyet been mentioned, viz.: ‘The Ice Cave,’ situated above the deep\r\nentrance from the Gorge. It is reached from the valley floor and is not\r\nof large dimensions, presenting only one chamber of any size, which has\r\nbeen christened ‘The Temple.’ The series has been named the Ice Cave\r\nfrom the fact that the initial passage entrance is blocked by ice all\r\nthe year round, and an entry is effected over this blockage.\r\n\r\n“The second set of passages are entered immediately below the Goat\r\nfalls, which pour into them until late in October, when they become\r\nice-bound. Last October, the writer followed two of the passages—one for\r\nabout 150 feet, the other for about 50 feet—but could get no farther\r\nwithout material for bridging. The formation resembles the passage\r\nleading to the Auditorium, but on a smaller scale, viz., a series of\r\nwell formed potholes connected one with the other. It is assumed that\r\nthe flow from the Goat falls, the big bulk of which passes through these\r\ntwo channels, empties into the main waterway at the Turbine, but its\r\ncourse may possibly be more direct. If it does not, however, it is\r\ndifficult to know where the water flowing in at the Turbine comes from.\r\n\r\n“It is still something more than half a mile from the end of the present\r\nexploration to the final point at which the subterranean waters of\r\nCougar creek are returned to the surface bed. There may consequently be\r\naccessible passageways that are yet undiscovered but, as the surface\r\ngrade over this unknown interior is much steeper and the subterranean\r\ncreek bed is approaching the surface, it seems probable that, if\r\nexisting, they will be found inaccessible.\r\n\r\n“The fact of W. S. Ayres having at two places within the Gorge series\r\nreached the actual bed of the subterranean stream would point to there\r\nbeing no further passages below that level. It would, therefore, appear\r\nthat the largest accessible portion of the series is now on record. Much\r\nof the part shown in red on the accompanying map is difficult of access\r\nand dangerous to unskilled climbers. Indeed, for that matter, there are\r\nplenty of difficult places throughout.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Formation of the Caves.\r\n\r\nMr. Ayres thinks that the Caves have been formed entirely by water\r\nerosion, but Mr. Wheeler differs from him in this respect. Mr. Ayres\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\n“The rocks in which the Cave occurs are of very hard crystalline\r\nlimestone, dipping about 30 degrees to the east. In ‘Entrance No. 1’\r\nthese beds are very thick and are made up of alternate bands of white,\r\nmottled and grey marble. Some of the bands are very highly impregnated\r\nwith fine sharp sand, so much so, in fact, that excellent whetstones can\r\nbe made from them.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: On the road 3½ miles from Glacier.\r\n White Pine may be observed along the route—a very unusual spectacle in\r\n                    the Selkirk range of mountains.]\r\n\r\n“The Cave has, undoubtedly, been formed entirely by water erosion. The\r\nstream which formed it, Cougar creek, is entirely made up of glacier and\r\nsnow water, and above the cave is free from any lime salts. Its\r\ncapacity, therefore, to dissolve lime rock when brought in contact with\r\nit, is at its maximum. The fine grains of sharp sand, loosened from the\r\nlime rock and caught in the swift current of the small stream that at\r\nfirst found its way through a shrinkage crack of some particular bed of\r\nlimestone, have undoubtedly given the water an uncommon erosive power,\r\nwhich, through the countless years of the cave’s history, has enabled\r\nthat mountain torrent to carve out a mammoth channel in solid marble.\r\n\r\n“The absence of all stalactites and stalagmites, such as are usually\r\nfound in caves, and the presence of curiously carved marble walls,\r\nwonderfully carved in fantastic shapes and sombre colouring, suddenly\r\nmake one realize that he is far removed from things familiar.”\r\n\r\nThe Indian word “Nakimu,” by which the Caves are generally known, has\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon equivalent of “grumbling.”\r\n\r\nThis might imply that in some distant past a seismic disturbance in the\r\ninterior of the mountain resulted in its Indian appellation, or, on the\r\nother hand, it may be due solely to the rumbling sound of the\r\nsubterranean torrent.\r\n\r\nMr. Wheeler, in differing from Mr. Ayres as to the factors mainly\r\ninstrumental in forming the underground channels and caverns as seen\r\nto-day, states his conviction that an agency, more potent and\r\nfar-reaching than mere erosion and disintegration by the ordinary\r\nprocesses of nature, has been at work.\r\n\r\nIn his arguments in this connection he says:—\r\n\r\n“From the point where Cougar creek first drops beneath Gopher bridge,\r\nthe old surface channel may be traced, though dammed and nearly\r\nobliterated in places. If the natural dam shown at the first point of\r\nentrance were removed, the stream would again revert to the old\r\nentrance. Southwest of the old entrance is a still older natural dam,\r\nwhose removal would allow the stream to proceed to the Mill bridge;\r\nthence, following the ravine between the two camp grounds, it would pass\r\ndirectly across the Gorge, supposing that great rift not yet to exist,\r\nand flowing past ‘Entrance No. 3,’ would descend in a cataract beyond\r\nLookout point.\r\n\r\n“There is no doubt that these particular beds of limestone are badly\r\nshattered in the mass. It is shown by the fact that the surrounding\r\nstreams, the Gopher falls, the periodical stream flowing to Entrance No.\r\n3, and that of the Goat falls all join the main stream by underground\r\nways. There are several other instances where the present bed of the\r\ncreek could hardly be due to shrinkage and erosion, as in the case of\r\nthe deep rift of the Gorge lying directly across the dip of the strata\r\n(the strata dip a little south of east, at an angle between 35 degrees\r\nand 40 degrees). The same thing is noticed in the subterranean bed of\r\nthe creek from the east end of the Witches Ball-room to where it crosses\r\nthe main corridor near the Art Gallery.\r\n\r\n“From October 16 to 21, last, during the survey made of the Gorge series\r\nby the writer, though it was well below zero at the camp in the woods,\r\nthere was no frost found in the cave interiors at a short distance from\r\nthe entrance. Thus, two of the highest factors of disintegration, sun\r\nand frost, are lacking, when accounting for the wholesale cleavage that\r\nhas taken place within the old waterways. The enormous size of the\r\nblocks, moreover, and the indication that the largest of them had been\r\ndisplaced a very long time ago would point to the agency of a severe\r\nshock or series of shocks such as would be caused by an earthquake or\r\nsome similar seismic disturbance. That such disturbances have taken\r\nplace and acted in this particular locality is borne out by other\r\ncurious phenomena for which it is difficult to find a different\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n“In 1904, Prof. W. H. Sherzer, on behalf of the Smithsonian Institution\r\nof Washington, D.C., visited the Canadian Rockies for the purpose of\r\nstudying their glaciers. Among a series of five, he made a special study\r\nof the Illecillewaet glacier situated about seven and a half miles from\r\nthe Caves. At some distance from the present ice-tongue of the glacier,\r\nwere found two moraines about a third of a mile apart, composed of\r\nenormous blocks of quartzite, weighing in some single instances as much\r\nas 1,250 tons, and retaining the original shape in which they were cast\r\nfrom the peaks above to the snow-field and glacier transporting them to\r\nthe place where they are now found. Prof. Sherzer has named these ‘Block\r\nMoraines’ in distinction to ordinary moraines composed of ice-worn,\r\nrounded boulders imbedded in a species of cement, commonly known as\r\nboulder clay.\r\n\r\n“The question is: How and at what time were these block moraines formed.\r\nAt the present day the glaciers are wholly incapable of transporting\r\nsuch a load, and no such quantities of material are to be found upon the\r\nsnow-field, below the peaks, as would be necessary to form a similar\r\nmoraine, even during a protracted period of rest on the part of the\r\nglacier.\r\n\r\n“In the endeavor to ascertain a date for their formation, Prof. Sherzer\r\ncut down trees growing between the two moraines and counted the rings of\r\ngrowth. The oldest was found to have an age of 550 years. Trees, also,\r\ngrowing on the inner or younger moraine were measured and the age of the\r\noldest ascertained to be 447 years. Allowing for the time required for\r\nthe collection of sufficient soil to permit of growth taking place, the\r\nmoraine, therefore, would be between 500 and 600 years old.\r\n\r\n“Professor Sherzer points to the probability of seismic disturbances\r\nbeing the cause of these block moraines and that the material of which\r\nthey are formed had been shaken from the peaks to the snow-field below.\r\nMaking due allowance for the period of transportation of the material\r\nforming the inner moraine, the earthquake would thus have occurred\r\nduring the thirteenth century. (See ‘Glacial Studies in the Canadian\r\nRockies and Selkirks, Smithsonian Expedition of 1904,’ by William\r\nHittell Sherzer, Ph. D.)\r\n\r\n“That disturbances of this nature have taken place in Canada at a much\r\nmore recent date is pointed out in the above report by the following\r\nquotation from the ‘_Jesuite Relations_,’ Thwaites translations, vol.\r\nxlvii, pp. 37-57; 183-223: ‘On the fifth of February, 1663, towards\r\nhalf-past five in the evening, a loud roaring was heard at the same time\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of Canadas. . . . On level ground,\r\nhills have arisen; mountains, on the other hand, have been depressed and\r\nflattened. Chasms of wonderful depth, exhaling a foul stench, have been\r\nhollowed out in many places, plains lie open, far and wide, where there\r\nwere formerly very dense and lofty forests. Cliffs, although not quite\r\nlevelled with the soil, have been shattered and overturned.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Government building at the Caves for the use of visitors.]\r\n\r\n“If the origin of block moraines can be accounted for by seismic\r\ndisturbances, it is not improbable to assume that at some remote date a\r\nsimilar occurrence has shattered this bed of crystalline limestone and\r\nprecipitated Cougar creek from its surface course into subterranean\r\nchannels, which, through the course of ages, it has enlarged to their\r\npresent size, and that subsequent shocks have been mainly responsible\r\nfor the large quantities of fallen debris that litter the interiors.\r\nUnder such a condition of affairs, the crack of the Gorge, and similar\r\nchasms found below the surface, would be accounted for.”\r\n\r\nThe gist of Mr. Ayres’ arguments concerning the probable age of the cave\r\nis contained in the following paragraphs:—\r\n\r\n“The marble rocks in which the cave is formed belong most probably to\r\nthe Devonian age. No fossils were found, however, to positively verify\r\nthis conclusion. The limestone rocks have not been completely changed\r\ninto marble at all points as was observed under ‘Gopher Bridge’ and in\r\n‘The Terror.’ Notwithstanding the fact that the rocks belong to a\r\ncomparatively old series, yet the beginning of the cave undoubtedly\r\ndates from a very recent geological time.\r\n\r\n“Assuming the rate of erosion to be one thirty-second of an inch in a\r\nyear, then to cut down one hundred feet of rock, which is about the\r\naverage amount eroded in the main cave, would require 38,400 years. Any\r\nactual rate greater or less than this assumption would increase or\r\ndiminish the age of the cave. In several places along Cougar creek in\r\nthe bottom of the cave an excellent opportunity is afforded to determine\r\nactually the present annual rate of erosion. A micrometer measuring\r\napparatus should be used and the area of cross-section of the rock\r\neroded per year thus accurately computed. Also the ratio between the\r\narea of the cross-section of the average stream and the area of the rock\r\neroded should be determined. And finally, the quantity of water passing\r\nthe given section in one year, and its velocity, should be accurately\r\nmeasured.\r\n\r\n“In contemplating the foregoing suggestion as to the probable age of the\r\ncave, it should be borne in mind that where gravel and sand lodge in the\r\nbed of the stream the rate of erosion is many times less than where the\r\nbed is continually swept clean by a more rapid current.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         EXCURSION SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nNakimu Caves may be reached by travelling to Glacier, in Glacier Park,\r\nB.C., on the Canadian Pacific railway, and from that point either by\r\nwalking or riding on a pony a distance of about seven miles along\r\nexcellent road and trail.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: A pic-nic party at the Caves.]\r\n\r\nThe distance to the Nakimu Caves from Glacier House by way of the wagon\r\nroad—Illecillewaet river and Cougar creek, is 7 miles; by horse trail,\r\nvia Rogers pass over the summit of Baloo pass to the Caves, the distance\r\nis 3 miles farther. Baloo pass is 6681 feet above sea-level, and from\r\nthe summit is an extensive view, including not only the Hermit range and\r\nMcDonald, but the Dawson peaks, Bishop range and the mountains that girt\r\nCougar valley.\r\n\r\nAt the Caves is a government building especially adapted for campers,\r\nwith cook stoves and other conveniences. Parties desiring to camp can\r\nmake arrangements by writing to C. H. Deutschman, The Caves, Glacier,\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\nThis camp is the starting point for many easy and hard rock climbs.\r\n\r\nFrom Cheops, whose altitude is 8,506 feet above sea-level, but only\r\n3,300 feet above the cabin, the view is unsurpassed, owing to its\r\ncentral location. The climb takes 3½ hours and, from the top, over 200\r\nglaciers can be counted, and on a clear day the Rocky mountains, 150\r\nmiles away, can be seen guarding the horizon with rugged peaks.\r\n\r\nCougar mountain (altitude, 7,882 feet, 2,500 feet above the camp) is an\r\neasier and shorter climb of 2 hours.\r\n\r\nUrsus Major, altitude, 8,930 feet; Ursus Minor, altitude, 9,026 feet;\r\nCatamount, altitude, 8,956 feet; Bagheera, altitude, 9,096 feet and many\r\nothers, are within the limit of a day’s climb.\r\n\r\nThe ice caves under the Glacier at the head of Cougar valley are also\r\nworth a visit. For botanists, this is a paradise, the alpine and\r\nsub-alpine flowers being gorgeous and abundant, and many rare species\r\nare found here. Over 150 species can be gathered in a short time in July\r\nor August.\r\n\r\nA two days’ camping trip may be undertaken as follows:—\r\n\r\nFrom Glacier House via Baloo pass to the Nakimu Caves, exploring Bear\r\ncreek and Cougar valleys, spending the night at Camp, visiting “The\r\nCaves” and arriving at Glacier in time for dinner the following evening.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\r\n                           TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP\r\n                        SHOWING THE POSITION OF\r\n                            THE NAKIMU CAVES\r\n                  in Cougar Creek Valley, Selkirk Mts.\r\n                           British Columbia]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n--Some palpable typographical errors were corrected.\r\n\r\n--Copyright and publisher’s information was included from the printed\r\n  copy: this eBook is public domain in the country of publication.",
