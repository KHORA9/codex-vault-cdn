Its action takes\r\nplace in a central part of North America, designated a Desert.  Some\r\npeople set out to travel in this central desert, when they somewhat lose\r\ntheir way.  Luckily they eventually spot the light of a farm-house,\r\nwhere they knock and receive hospitality.\r\n\r\nTheir kind host and his family then explain to them how they came to\r\nlive where they do, and what a lovely place it is.  Reid is very\r\nknowledgeable about animals and also plants.  Much of the rest of the\r\nbook is taken up with tales of encounters with various animals, and with\r\nstories of the uses of many trees and shrubs.\r\n\r\nIt is written in an unusual style, but in fact, because of the shortness\r\nof the chapters, it can hold the reader's attention very well.\r\n\r\nAs with several other books by this author it had been very badly\r\ntypeset, apparently using old and damaged type.  This made the OCRed\r\nversion of the text come out very full of misreads, but it was fun\r\ntidying this up.  Apologies if any more misreads come to light.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nTHE DESERT HOME, BY CAPTAIN MAYNE REID.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT AMERICAN DESERT.\r\n\r\nThere is a great desert in the interior of North America.  It is almost\r\nas large as the famous Saara of Africa.  It is fifteen hundred miles\r\nlong, and a thousand wide.  Now, if it were of a regular shape--that is\r\nto say, a parallelogram--you could at once compute its area, by\r\nmultiplying the length upon the breadth; and you would obtain one\r\nmillion and a half for the result--one million and a half of square\r\nmiles.  But its outlines are as yet very imperfectly known; and although\r\nit is fully fifteen hundred miles long, and in some places a thousand in\r\nbreadth, its surface-extent is probably not over one million of square\r\nmiles, or twenty-five times the size of England.  Fancy a desert\r\ntwenty-five times as big as all England!  Do you not think that it has\r\nreceived a most appropriate name when it is called the _Great American\r\nDesert_?\r\n\r\nNow, my young friend, what do you understand by a desert?  I think I can\r\nguess.  When you read or hear of a desert, you think of a vast level\r\nplain, covered with sand, and without trees, or grass, or _any_ kind of\r\nvegetation.  You think, also, of this sand being blown about in thick\r\nyellow clouds, and no water to be met with in any direction.  This is\r\nyour idea of a desert, is it not?  Well, it is not altogether the\r\ncorrect one.  It is true that in almost every desert there are these\r\nsandy plains, yet are there other parts of its surface of a far\r\ndifferent character, equally deserving the name of _desert_.  Although\r\nthe interior of the great Saara has not been fully explored, enough is\r\nknown of it to prove that it contains large tracts of mountainous and\r\nhilly country, with rocks and valleys, lakes, rivers, and springs.\r\nThere are, also, fertile spots, at wide distances from each other,\r\ncovered with trees, and shrubs, and beautiful vegetation.  Some of these\r\nspots are small, while others are of large extent, and inhabited by\r\nindependent tribes, and even whole kingdoms of people.  A fertile tract\r\nof this kind is called an oasis; and, by looking at your map, you will\r\nperceive that there are many oases in the Saara of Africa.\r\n\r\nOf a similar character is the Great American Desert; but its surface is\r\nstill more varied with what may be termed \"geographical features.\"\r\nThere are plains--some of them more than a hundred miles wide--where you\r\ncan see nothing but white sand, often drifting about on the wind, and\r\nhere and there thrown into long ridges such as those made by a\r\nsnowstorm.  There are other plains, equally large, where no sand\r\nappears, but brown barren earth utterly destitute of vegetation.  There\r\nare others, again, on which grows a stunted shrub with leaves of a pale\r\nsilvery colour.  In some places it grows so thickly, interlocking its\r\ntwisted and knotty branches, that a horseman can hardly ride through\r\namong them.  This shrub is the _artemisia_--a species of wild sage or\r\nwormwood,--and the plains upon which it grows are called by the hunters,\r\nwho cross them, the _sage prairies_.  Other plains are met with that\r\npresent a black aspect to the traveller.  These are covered with lava,\r\nthat at some distant period of time has been vomited forth from volcanic\r\nmountains, and now lies frozen up, and broken into small fragments like\r\nthe stones upon a new-made road.  Still other plains present themselves\r\nin the American Desert.  Some are white, as if snow had fallen freshly\r\nupon them, and yet it is not snow, but salt!  Yes; pure white salt--\r\ncovering the ground six inches deep, and for fifty miles in every\r\ndirection!  Others, again, have a similar appearance; but instead of\r\nsalt, you find the substance which covers them to be soda--a beautiful\r\nefflorescence of soda!\r\n\r\nThere are mountains, too--indeed, one-half of this Desert is very\r\nmountainous; and the great chain of the Rocky Mountains--of which you\r\nhave no doubt heard--runs sheer through it from north to south, and\r\ndivides it into two nearly equal parts.  But there are other mountains\r\nbesides these; mountains of every height, and sometimes in their shape\r\nand colour presenting very striking and singular appearance.  Some of\r\nthem run for miles in horizontal ridges like the roofs of houses, and\r\nseemingly so narrow at their tops that one might sit astride of them.\r\nOthers, again, of a conical form, stand out in the plain apart from the\r\nrest, and look like teacups turned upside down in the middle of a table.\r\nThen there are sharp peaks that shoot upward like needles, and others\r\nshaped like the dome of some great cathedral--like the dome of Saint\r\nPaul's.  These mountains are of many colours.  Some are dark, or\r\ndark-green, or blue when seen from a distance.  They are of this colour\r\nwhen covered by forests of pine or cedar, both of which trees are found\r\nin great plenty among the mountains of the Desert.\r\n\r\nThere are many mountains, where no trees are seen, nor any signs of\r\nvegetation along their sides.  Huge naked rocks of granite appear piled\r\nupon each other, or jutting out over dark and frowning chasms.  There\r\nare peaks perfectly white, because they are covered with a thick mantle\r\nof snow.  These can always be seen from the greatest distance, as the\r\nsnow lying upon them all the year without melting proves them to be of\r\nvast elevation above the level of the sea.  There are other peaks almost\r\nas white, and yet it is not with snow.  They are of a milky hue, and\r\nstunted cedar-trees may be seen clinging in seams and crevices along\r\ntheir sides.  These are mountains of pure limestone, or the white quartz\r\nrock.  There are mountains, again, upon which neither tree nor leaf is\r\nto be; seen; but, in their stead, the most vivid colours of red and\r\ngreen and yellow and white, appearing in stripes along their sides, as\r\nthough they had been freshly painted.  These stripes mark the strata of\r\ndifferent coloured rocks, of which the mountains are composed.  And\r\nthere are still other mountains in the Great American Desert, to startle\r\nthe traveller with their strange appearance.  They are those that\r\nglitter with the mica and selenite.  These, when seen from a distance\r\nflashing under the sun, look as though they were mountains of silver and\r\ngold!\r\n\r\nThe rivers, too.  Strange rivers are they.  Some run over broad shallow\r\nbeds of bright sand.  Large rivers--hundreds of yards in width, with\r\nsparkling waters.  Follow them down their course.  What do you find?\r\nInstead of growing larger, like the rivers of your own land, they become\r\nless and less, until at length their waters sink into the sands, and you\r\nsee nothing but the dry channel for miles after miles!  Go still farther\r\ndown, and again the water appears, and increases in volume, until--\r\nthousands of miles from the sea--large ships can float upon their bosom.\r\nSuch are the Arkansas and the Platte.\r\n\r\nThere are other rivers that run between bleak, rocky banks--banks a\r\nthousand feet high, whose bald, naked \"bluffs\" frown at each other\r\nacross the deep chasm, in the bottom of which roars the troubled water.\r\nOften these banks extend for hundreds of miles, so steep at all points\r\nthat one cannot go down to the bed of their stream; and often--often--\r\nthe traveller has perished with thirst, while the roar of their water\r\nwas sounding in his ears!  Such are the Colorado and the Snake.\r\n\r\nStill others go sweeping through the broad plains, tearing up the clay\r\nwith their mighty floods, and year after year changing their channels,\r\nuntil they are sometimes an hundred miles from their ancient beds.  Here\r\nthey are found gurgling for many leagues under ground--under vast rafts\r\nformed by the trees which they have borne downward in their current.\r\nThere you find them winding by a thousand loops like the sinuosities of\r\na great serpent, rolling sluggishly along, with waters red and turbid as\r\nthough they were rivers of blood!  Such are the Brazos and the Red\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nStrange rivers are they that struggle through the mountains, and\r\nvalleys, and plateau-lands of the Great American Desert.\r\n\r\nNot less strange are its lakes.  Some lie in the deep recesses of hills\r\nthat dip down so steeply you cannot reach their shores; while the\r\nmountains around them are so bleak and naked, that not even a bird ever\r\nwings its flight across their silent waters.  Other lakes are seen in\r\nbroad, barren plains; and yet, a few years after, the traveller finds\r\nthem not--they have dried up and disappeared.  Some are fresh, with\r\nwaters like crystal--others brackish and muddy--while many of them are\r\nmore salt than the ocean itself.\r\n\r\nIn this Desert there are springs--springs of soda and sulphur, and salt\r\nwaters; and others so hot that they boil up as in a great caldron, and\r\nyou could not dip your finger into them without scalding it.\r\n\r\nThere are vast caves piercing the sides of the mountains, and deep\r\nchasms opening into the plains--some of them so deep, that you might\r\nfancy mountains had been scooped out to form them.  They are called\r\n\"barrancas.\"  There are precipices rising straight up from the plains--\r\nthousands of feet in height--and steep as a wall; and through the\r\nmountains themselves you may see great clefts cut by the rivers, as\r\nthough they had been tunnelled and their tops had fallen in.  They are\r\ncalled \"canons.\"  All these singular formations mark the wild region of\r\nthe Great American Desert.\r\n\r\nIt has its denizens.  There are oases in it; some of them large, and\r\nsettled by civilised men.  One of these is the country of New Mexico,\r\ncontaining many towns, and 100,000 inhabitants.  These are of the\r\nSpanish and mixed Indian races.  Another oasis is the country around the\r\nGreat Salt and Utah Lakes.  Here is also a settlement, established in\r\n1846.  Its people are Americans and Englishmen.  They are the Mormons;\r\nand, although they dwell hundreds of miles from any sea, they seem\r\nlikely to become a large and powerful nation of themselves.\r\n\r\nBesides these two great oases, there are thousands of others, of all\r\nsizes--from fifty miles in breadth, to the little spot of a _few_ acres,\r\nformed by the fertilising waters of some gurgling spring.  Many of these\r\nare without inhabitants.  In others, again, dwell tribes of Indians--\r\nsome of them numerous and powerful, possessing horses and cattle; while\r\nothers are found in small groups of three or four families each,\r\nsubsisting miserably upon roots, seeds, grass, reptiles, and insects.\r\nIn addition to the two great settlements we have mentioned, and the\r\nIndians, there is another class of men scattered over this region.\r\nThese are white men--hunters and trappers.  They subsist by trapping the\r\nbeaver, and hunting the buffalo and other animals.  Their life is one\r\ncontinued scene of peril, both from the wild animals which they\r\nencounter in their lonely excursions, and the hostile Indians with whom\r\nthey come in contact.  These men procure the furs of the beaver, the\r\notter, the musk-rat, the marten, the ermine, the lynx, the fox, and the\r\nskins of many other animals.  This is their business, and by this they\r\nlive.  There are forts, or trading posts--established by adventurous\r\nmerchants--at long distances from each other; and at these forts the\r\ntrappers exchange their furs for food, clothing, and for the necessary\r\nimplements of their perilous calling.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of men who traverse the Great Desert.  For many\r\nyears there has been a commerce carried on between the oasis of New\r\nMexico and the United States.  This commerce employs a considerable\r\namount of capital, and a great number of men--principally Americans.\r\nThe goods transported in large wagons drawn by mules or oxen; and a\r\ntrain of these wagons is called a \"caravan.\"  Other caravans--Spanish\r\nones--cross the western wing of the Desert, from Sonora to California,\r\nand thence to New Mexico.  Thus, you see, the American Desert has its\r\ncaravans as well as the Saara of Africa.\r\n\r\nThese caravans travel for hundreds of miles through countries in which\r\nthere are no inhabitants, except the scattered and roving bands of\r\nIndians; and there are many parts on their routes so sterile, that not\r\neven Indians can exist there.\r\n\r\nThe caravans, however, usually follow a track which is known, and where\r\ngrass and water may be found at certain seasons of the year.  There are\r\nseveral of these tracks, or, as they are called, \"trails,\" that cross\r\nfrom the frontier settlements of the United States to those of New\r\nMexico.  Between one and another of these trails, however, stretch vast\r\nregions of desert country--entirely unexplored and unknown--and many\r\nfertile spots exist, that have never been trodden by the foot of man.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, my young friend, is a rough sketch of some of the more\r\nprominent features of the Great American Desert.\r\n\r\nLet me conduct you into it, and show you--from a nearer view--some of\r\nits wild but interesting aspects.  I shall not show you the wildest of\r\nthem, lest they might terrify you.  Fear not--I shall not lead you into\r\ndanger.  Follow me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE PEAK.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, I was one of a party of \"prairie merchants,\" who crossed\r\nwith a caravan from Saint Louis on the Mississippi, to Santa Fe in New\r\nMexico.  We followed the usual \"Santa Fe trail.\"  Not disposing of all\r\nour goods in New Mexico, we kept on to the great town of Chihuahua,\r\nwhich lies farther to the south.  There we settled our business, and\r\nwere about to return to the United States the way we had come, when it\r\nwas proposed (as we had now nothing to encumber us but our bags of\r\nmoney), that we should explore a new \"trail\" across the prairies.  We\r\nall wished to find a better route than the Santa Fe road; and we\r\nexpected that such an one lay between the town of El Paso--on the Del\r\nNorte River--and some point on the frontiers of Arkansas.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at El Paso, we sold our wagons, and purchased Mexican\r\npack-mules--engaging, at the same time, a number of \"arrieros,\" or\r\nmuleteers to manage them.  We also purchased saddle-horses--the small\r\ntight horses of New Mexico, which are excellent for journeying in the\r\nDesert.  We provided ourselves, moreover, with such articles of clothing\r\nand provisions as we might require upon our unknown route.  Having got\r\neverything ready for the journey, we bade adieu to El Paso, and turned\r\nour faces eastward.  There were in all twelve of us--traders, and a\r\nnumber of hunters, who had agreed to accompany us across the plains.\r\nThere was a miner, too, who belonged to a copper mine near El Paso.\r\nThere were also four Mexicans--the \"arrieros\" who had charge of our\r\nlittle train of pack-mules.  Of coarse, we were all well armed, and\r\nmounted upon the best horses we could procure for money.\r\n\r\nWe had first to cross over the Rocky Mountains, which run north and\r\nsouth through all the country.  That chain of them which lies eastward\r\nof El Paso is called the Sierra de Organos, or \"Organ mountains.\"  They\r\nare so called from the fancied resemblance which is seen in one of their\r\ncliffs to the tubes of an organ.  These cliffs are of trap rock, which,\r\nas you are aware, often presents very fantastic and singular formations,\r\nby means of its peculiar stratification.  But there is a still more\r\ncurious feature about these Organ mountains.  On the top of one of them\r\nis a lake, which has its tides that ebb and flow like the tides of the\r\nocean!  No one has yet accounted for this remarkable phenomenon, and it\r\nremains a puzzle to the geological inquirer.  This lake is a favourite\r\nresort for the wild animals of the country, and deer and elk are found\r\nin great numbers around its shores.  They are not even molested by the\r\nMexican hunters of these parts, who seem to have a superstitious fear of\r\nthe spirits of the Organ mountains, and rarely climb up their steep\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nOur party found an easy pass through the range, which brought us out\r\ninto an open country on the other side.  After travelling several days\r\nthrough the eastern spurs of the Rocky Mountains, known as the Sierras\r\nSacramento and Guadalupe, we struck upon a small stream, which we\r\nfollowed downward.  It brought us at length to a large river running\r\nnorth and south, which we knew to be the celebrated Pecos, or, as it is\r\nsometimes called, the Puerco.  These, you will perceive, are all Spanish\r\nnames, for the country through which we were travelling, although\r\nuninhabited and almost unexplored by the Mexican Spaniards, was yet part\r\nof their territory; and such objects as were known to them, through\r\nhunters or others, had received names in their language.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the Pecos, and travelled for some days up its left bank, in\r\nhopes of reaching some other stream that might run into it from the\r\neast, which we could follow.  No such stream appeared; and we were\r\nforced at times to leave the Pecos itself, and take out into the open\r\ncountry for a distance of miles, before we could get back to its waters.\r\nThis was on account of the deep channel which the river--working for\r\nlong ages--had cut through hills that opposed its course, leaving on\r\nboth sides vast precipices for its banks.\r\n\r\nHaving got farther to the north than we wished, our party at length\r\ndetermined to attempt the passage of the arid plain which stretched away\r\neastward as far as the eye could reach.  It was a perilous enterprise to\r\nleave the river, without some knowledge that there was water ahead of\r\nus.  Travellers, under such circumstances, usually keep close to a\r\nstream--wherever it runs in the direction in which they wish to go; but\r\nwe had grown impatient on not finding one flowing into the Pecos from\r\nthe east; and, having filled our gourd canteens, and given our animals\r\nas much water as they could drink, we turned their heads towards the\r\nopen plain.\r\n\r\nAfter riding for several hours, we found ourselves in the midst of a\r\nwide desert, with neither hill, mountain, nor any other landmark in\r\nview.  Scarcely a trace of vegetation appeared around us.  Here and\r\nthere were patches of stunted sage-bushes and clumps of thorny cactus;\r\nbut not a blade of grass to gladden the eyes of our animals.  Not a drop\r\nof water was met with, nor any indication that rain had ever fallen upon\r\nthat parched plain.  The soil was as dry as powder, and the dust, kicked\r\nup by the hoofs of our mules and horses, hung around us in clouds as we\r\nmarched.  In addition to this, the heat was excessive; and this, with\r\nthe dust and fatigue of travel, brought on an unquenchable thirst, that\r\nsoon caused us to drink up the contents of our water-gourds.  Long\r\nbefore night they were all empty, and every one of our party was crying\r\nout from thirst.  Our animals suffered worse--for we, at least, had\r\nfood, while they, poor brutes, were without a bite to sustain them.\r\n\r\nWe could not well turn back.  We thought we should surely come to water,\r\nsooner than we could get back to the river we had left; and with this\r\nhope we struggled on.  Late in the afternoon, our eyes were greeted by a\r\nglad sight, that caused us to start up in our saddles with a feeling of\r\njoy.  You may think that it was water--but it was not.  It was a white\r\nobject that appeared against the sky at a great distance.  It was of a\r\ntriangular shape, and seemed to be suspended in the air like the upper\r\nhalf of a huge kite.  All of us knew at a glance what it was.  We knew\r\nthat it was the white cap of a snowy mountain.\r\n\r\nYou will wonder why this sight should have given us such feelings of\r\npleasure, as, in your opinion, there is nothing very hospitable in the\r\nappearance of a snow-capped mountain.  That is because you do not\r\nunderstand the peculiarities of the Desert.  I will explain.  We knew,\r\nfrom the appearance of the mountain, that it was one of those where the\r\nsnow lies for ever, and which throughout Mexico are termed \"Nevada,\" or\r\nsnowy.  We knew, moreover, that wherever these are met with, streams of\r\nwater will be found running down their sides, almost at all seasons, but\r\ncertainly in hot or summer weather, in consequence of the melting of the\r\nsnow.  It was this knowledge, then, that cheered us; and although the\r\nmountain seemed at a great distance, we pushed forward with renewed\r\nenergy and hope.  Our animals, too, as if they also understood the\r\nmatter, neighed and brayed loudly, and stepped out with a more springy\r\nand elastic tread.\r\n\r\nThe white triangle grew bigger as we advanced.  At sunset we could\r\ndistinguish the brown seams in the lower part of the mountain; and the\r\nyellow rays glancing upon the snowy crystals of the cone caused it to\r\nglitter like a coronet of gold.  The sight cheered us on.\r\n\r\nThe sun set, and the moon took his place in the heavens.  Under her pale\r\nlight we travelled on--the peak of the mountain still glistening coldly\r\nbefore us.  We travelled all night--and why not?  There was nothing to\r\nhalt for.  We could not have halted, except to die.\r\n\r\nThe morning broke upon us as we dragged wearily along.  We could not\r\nhave ridden less than an hundred miles since leaving the Pecos river;\r\nand yet, to our dismay, the mountain was still at a good distance before\r\nus.  As the day brightened, we could trace the configuration of its\r\nbase; and we observed that upon its southern face a deep ravine indented\r\nthe mountain nearly to its top.  On its western side--the one nearest\r\nus--there was no such feature; and we conjectured that the most likely\r\nplace for water would be in the ravine on the south, where a stream\r\nwould be formed by the aggregation of the melted snows.\r\n\r\nWe directed our course toward the point, where the ravine appeared to\r\nhave its debouchement on the plain.  We had calculated rightly.  As we\r\napproached it, winding round the foot of the mountain, we saw a line of\r\na bright green colour, running out into the brown desert.  It looked\r\nlike a low hedge, with here and there tall trees growing up above the\r\nrest.  We knew well what it was--a grove of willows, with trees of\r\ncotton-wood interspersed.  We knew them to be the sure signs of water,\r\nand we hailed their appearance with delight.  The men huzzaed hoarsely--\r\nthe horses neighed--the mules hinnied--and, in a few moments more, men,\r\nmules, and horses, were kneeling by a crystal streamlet, and drinking\r\ndeeply of its sweet and refreshing waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OASIS.\r\n\r\nAfter so long and terrible a journey, of course, we all stood in need of\r\nrest and refreshment.  We made up our minds to stay by the stream all\r\nnight, and perhaps for a day or two.  The fringe of willows extended on\r\nboth sides of it for a distance of fifty yards into the plain; and among\r\nthese, growing under their shade, there were patches of grass--that\r\nspecies known in Mexico as the _gramma_ grass.  It is a rich, nutritious\r\nherbage; and horses and cattle--as well as the buffaloes and other wild\r\nanimals--are very fond of it.  Our mules and horses gave proof of this;\r\nfor, as soon as they had satisfied themselves with the water, they\r\nattacked it with open mouths, and eyes sparkling with delight.  We\r\nrelieved them of their packs and saddles: and then, having picketed\r\nthem, left them to eat to their hearts' content.\r\n\r\nWe now set about looking after something for our own supper.  We had not\r\nyet suffered much from hunger, as we had occasionally chewed pieces of\r\nour dried meat while crossing the plain.  But we had eaten it quite raw;\r\nand _tasajo_--for that is its name--is no great eating, either raw or\r\nroasted.  We had been living upon it for more than a week, and we longed\r\nfor something fresh.  During all the route from El Paso we had fallen in\r\nwith no game, except some half-dozen lean antelopes, only one of which\r\nwe had succeeded in shooting.\r\n\r\nWhile we were picketing our animals, and getting ready to cook our\r\nsupper of coffee and tasajo, one of the hunters--a tireless fellow named\r\nLincoln--had stolen off up the ravine.  Presently we heard the sharp\r\ncrack of his rifle ringing through the defile; and, looking up, we saw a\r\nflock of \"bighorns\"--so the wild sheep of the Rocky Mountains are\r\ncalled--leaping from rock to rock, and almost flying like birds up the\r\nface of the cliffs.  It was not long before Lincoln made his appearance\r\nat the mouth of the defile, carrying a large body upon his shoulders--\r\nwhich we knew, by the huge crescent-shaped horns, had once been a member\r\nof the flock we had seen escaping.  It proved to be as fat as a buck;\r\nand the knives of the skilful hunters were not long in skinning and\r\ndissecting it.  Meanwhile, a couple of axes had been grappled by stout\r\nhands; a cotton-wood tree name crashing down after a few sharp blows;\r\nand, having been cut into \"logs,\" was soon crackling under the red\r\nblaze.  Over this, the ribs and steaks of the bighorn soon sputtered,\r\nand the coffee-kettle steamed, simmered, and bubbled, with its brown and\r\naromatic contents.  Our supper over, one and all of us rolled ourselves\r\nin our blankets, and were soon forgetful of the perils through which we\r\nhad passed.\r\n\r\nNext morning we arose refreshed, and after breakfast a consultation was\r\nheld as to what course we should now take.  We would have followed the\r\nstream, but it appeared to run in a southerly direction, and that would\r\nnot do for us.  We wanted to go eastward.  While we were deliberating\r\nupon this, an exclamation from the hunter Lincoln drew our attention.\r\nHe was standing in the open ground, at some distance out from the\r\nwillows, and pointing southward.  We all looked in that direction, and,\r\nto our great surprise, beheld a pillar of blue smoke curling up into the\r\nsky, and seeming to rise out of the plain!\r\n\r\n\"It must be Indians!\" cried one.\r\n\r\n\"I noticed an odd-looking hole in the prairie down there,\" said Lincoln;\r\n\"I noticed it last night, when I was up after the bighorn.  The smoke we\r\nsee comes out of it; and where there's smoke there must be a fire, they\r\nsay--there's somebody about that fire, be they Injuns or whites.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indians, of course,\" rejoined several; \"who else would be found within\r\nhundreds of miles of such a place as this?  Indians, they must be.\"\r\n\r\nA brief consultation was held among us, as to what was best to be done.\r\nOur fire was at once \"choked out,\" and our mules and horses brought into\r\nthe cover of the willow thicket.  Some proposed that a small party of us\r\nshould go down the stream and reconnoitre; while others advised that we\r\nshould climb the mountain, from which we might get a view of the strange\r\nplace whence the smoke seemed to proceed.  This was plainly the best\r\ncourse to adopt--as, in case it should fail to satisfy us, we could\r\nstill follow the other plan.  Half-a-dozen of us, therefore, leaving the\r\nothers to guard the camp, immediately set out to ascend the mountain.\r\n\r\nWe climbed up the ravine, occasionally stopping to look out over the\r\nplain.  We climbed until we had reached a considerable elevation.  At\r\nlength we caught a glimpse of what appeared to be a deep barranca,--into\r\nwhich ran the stream--but we could distinguish nothing within it at so\r\ngreat a distance.  We could see the plain stretching away beyond, naked\r\nand sterile.  On one side only, and that towards the east, there was a\r\nbelt of verdure, with here and there a solitary tree, or at most two or\r\nthree growing together, stunted-like and shrubby.  Running in the centre\r\nof this belt, we could distinguish a line or crack in the plain.  This\r\nwas, no doubt, a channel by which the stream escaped from the barranca.\r\nAs nothing farther could be gained by remaining upon the mountain, we\r\ndescended, and joined our companions at the camp.\r\n\r\nIt was now agreed that a select party should follow the stream, until we\r\nhad approached the edge of this strange valley, and reconnoitred it with\r\ncaution.  Six of us again started, leaving our horses as before.  We\r\nstole silently along, keeping among the willows, and as near as possible\r\nto the banks of the rivulet.  In this way we travelled about a mile and\r\na half.  We saw then that we were near to the end of the barranca.  We\r\ncould hear a noise like the sound of a waterfall.  We guessed that it\r\nmust be a cataract formed by the stream, where it leaped into the\r\nstrange ravine that already began to expand before our faces.  We were\r\nright in our conjectures, for the next moment we crept out upon the edge\r\nof a fearful cliff, where the water of the rivulet swept over, and fell\r\nthrough a height of several hundred feet.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful sight to look upon, as the long jet, curving like the\r\ntail of a horse, plunged into the foaming pool below; and then rising\r\nwith its millions of globules of snowy spray, glittered under the\r\nsunbeam with all the colours of the rainbow.  It was, indeed, a\r\nbeautiful sight; but our eyes did not dwell long upon it, for other\r\nobjects were before them that filled us with wonder.  Away below--far\r\nbelow where we were--lay a lovely valley, smiling in all the luxuriance\r\nof bright vegetation.  It was of nearly an oval shape, bounded upon all\r\nsides by a frowning precipice, that rose around it like a wall.  Its\r\nlength could not have been less than ten miles, and its greatest breadth\r\nabout half of its length.  We were at its upper end, and of course\r\nviewed it lengthwise.  Along the face of the precipice there were trees\r\nhanging out horizontally, and some of them even growing with their tops\r\ndownward.  These trees were cedars and pines; and we could perceive also\r\nthe knotted limbs of huge cacti protruding from the crevices of the\r\nrocks.  We could see the mezcal, or wild maguey plant, growing against\r\nthe cliff--its scarlet leaves contrasting finely with the dark foliage\r\nof the cedars and cacti.  Some of these plants stood out on the very\r\nbrow of the overhanging precipice, and their long curving blades gave a\r\nsingular character to the landscape.  Along the face of the dark cliffs\r\nall was rough, and gloomy, and picturesque.  How different was the scene\r\nbelow!  Here everything looked soft, and smiling, and beautiful.  There\r\nwere broad stretches of woodland, where the thick foliage of the trees\r\nmet and clustered together, so that it looked like the surface of the\r\nearth itself; but we knew it was only the green leaves, for here and\r\nthere were spots of brighter green, that we saw were glades covered with\r\ngrassy turf.  The leaves of the trees were of different colours, for it\r\nwas now late in the autumn.  Some were yellow, and some of a deep claret\r\ncolour.  Some were bright red, and some of a beautiful maroon; and there\r\nwere green, and brighter green, and others of a silvery, whitish hue.\r\nAll these colours were mingled together, and blended into each other,\r\nlike the flowers upon a rich carpet.\r\n\r\nNear the centre of the valley was a large shining object, which we knew\r\nto be water.  It was evidently a lake of crystal purity, and smooth as a\r\nmirror.  The sun was now up to meridian height, and his yellow beams\r\nfalling upon its surface caused it to gleam like a sheet of gold.  We\r\ncould not trace the outlines of the water--for the trees partially hid\r\nit from our view--but we saw that the smoke that had at first attracted\r\nus rose up somewhere from the western shore of the lake.\r\n\r\nWe returned to the camp, where we had left our companions.  It was now\r\nagreed that we should all ride down the side of the barranca together,\r\nuntil we could find a place to descend into it.  It was evident some\r\nsuch place existed, else, how could they have got in who had kindled the\r\nfire there?\r\n\r\nWe left the Mexicans in camp with our mules, and all the rest of us\r\nhaving mounted our horses, rode off together.  We went by the eastern\r\nside, keeping well back upon the plain, so that we might not be seen\r\nuntil we discovered what sort of people were in the valley.  When we had\r\ngot opposite to where the smoke was still curling up, we stopped; and\r\ntwo of us, dismounting, crawled forward to the very edge of the\r\nprecipice.  We took care to keep some bushes, that grew along the brink,\r\nbetween ourselves and the lake.  At length we were able to get a good\r\nview of everything below; and a very strange sight that was,--at least\r\nit was very strange in such a place, where it was so little expected.\r\nThere was a large lake--as I have already stated--and on its opposite\r\nside, not over a hundred yards from its shore, was a fine-looking\r\nlog-house, with other smaller ones standing in the rear.  There were\r\nrail-fences around them, and a cleared space divided into fields, some\r\nof which appeared to be under cultivation, while others were green and\r\nfilled with flocks of animals.  The whole picture was exactly like a\r\nsnug farm-house, with its stables and other outhouses, with its garden\r\nand fields, and horses and cattle!  The distance was too great for us to\r\ndistinguish what sort of cattle they were, but there appeared to be many\r\nkinds, both red, and black, and speckled.  We could see several figures\r\nof men and boys--four of them in all--moving about the enclosures, and\r\nthere was a woman near the door of the house.  It was impossible in the\r\ndistance to tell whether they were white people, but we never imagined\r\nfor a moment they could be Indians.  No Indian could have built such a\r\nhouse.  Of course we were filled with astonishment at finding such a\r\npicture in so unexpected a place; and a beautiful picture it was to our\r\neyes, fresh as we were from looking upon the barren desert.  The lake\r\nwas smooth as a mirror; the sun was shining upon it, and we could see\r\nupon its farther shore several large animals standing up to their knee\r\nin the water.\r\n\r\nThere were many other striking objects which met our eyes, but we had no\r\ntime to dwell upon them, and we crawled back again to our companions.\r\n\r\nIt was at once agreed that we should go still farther down, and\r\nendeavour to find a road leading into this most singular oasis.  We\r\nthought we could distinguish a sort of depression in the plain near the\r\nlower end of the valley, and for this point we directed our course.\r\nAfter riding a few miles farther we reached the place where the stream\r\nissued out in an easterly direction.  There sure enough, was the very\r\nroad we were in search of, winding down along the bank of the stream,\r\nand as if carved out from the face of the precipice.  It was not much\r\nwider than the track of a wagon, but was of very easy descent.  We did\r\nnot hesitate a moment, but commenced riding downward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGE SETTLEMENT.\r\n\r\nWe were soon in the bottom of the valley, where we followed a plain\r\ntrack that led along the banks of the rivulet.  We knew that that would\r\ndirect us up to the lake, where we should get a view of the house.  We\r\nwere astonished at the great variety of trees which we saw in the woods;\r\nbut there appeared to be almost as great a variety of beautiful birds,\r\nthat fluttered among the leaves as we rode forward.\r\n\r\nWe came at length within sight of the opening in which the house and\r\nlake were situated.  It was prudent to make another reconnoissance\r\nbefore we advanced farther; and two of us, again dismounting, stole\r\ncautiously forward through a thicket of leafy Shrubs.  The house and all\r\nits grounds lay before us.\r\n\r\nIt was a log-house--such as are met with in the western states of\r\nAmerica--and well constructed.  There was a garden at one end, and\r\nfields on all sides.  These fields were, as we had supposed, some of\r\nthem under cultivation.  We noticed one with a crop of Indian corn, and\r\nanother of wheat.  But what most astonished us was the kind of animals\r\nwe saw in the enclosures.  One would have thought at first sight that\r\nthey were the animals usually seen around an English or American\r\nfarm-house,--that is to say, horses, cattle, sheep, goats, hogs, and\r\npoultry.  You may fancy, then, our surprise, when, on looking narrowly\r\nat them, we could not make out a single animal exactly resembling any\r\none of the above, with the exception of horses; and even these were\r\nunlike the common kind, for they were smaller, and spotted all over like\r\nhounds!  We knew that they were _mustangs_--the wild horses of the\r\nDesert.\r\n\r\nWe glanced at the animals we had taken for black cattle.  What were they\r\nbut buffaloes!  Buffaloes penned up in fields, and not heeding the human\r\nbeings that passed shouting among them!  More than all, we now saw that\r\ntwo animals yoked to the plough were of the same species,--a pair of\r\nhuge buffalo bulls; and they were working with all the quietness and\r\nregularity of oxen!\r\n\r\nAnother kind of large animals drew our attention, still taller than the\r\nbuffaloes.  We saw several of them standing quietly in the water of the\r\nlake, in which their huge bodies and branching horns were shadowed as in\r\na mirror.  These we knew to be elk--the great American elk.  We saw\r\nseveral kinds of deer, and antelopes with their short pronged horns, and\r\nanimals that resembled these last in size--but with immense curving\r\nhorns like those of the ram--and other animals like goats or sheep.  We\r\nsaw some without tails, having the appearance of pigs, and others\r\nresembling foxes and dogs.  We could see fowls of different kinds moving\r\nabout the doors, and among others we distinguished the tall, upright\r\nform of the wild turkey.  The whole picture looked like the collection\r\nof some zoological garden or menagerie.\r\n\r\nTwo men were seen,--one a tall, white man, with a somewhat florid\r\ncomplexion.  The other was a short and very thick-set negro.  The latter\r\nwas by the plough.  There were two younger men, or lads nearly grown.  A\r\nwoman sat by the door engaged in some occupation, and near her were two\r\nlittle girls, no doubt her daughters.\r\n\r\nBut the sight which was strangest of all, both to my companion and\r\nmyself, was what appeared in front of the house, and around the little\r\nporch where the woman was sitting.  It was a fearful sight to look upon.\r\nFirst there were two large black bears, perfectly loose, and playing\r\nwith each other!  Then there were several smaller animals, that we had\r\nat first taken for dogs, but that we now recognised, by their bushy\r\ntails, sharp snouts, and short erect ears, to have at least as much of\r\nthe wolf as dog in them.  They were of that kind often met with among\r\nthe Indians, and might more properly be called dog-wolves than\r\nwolf-dogs.  There were at least half-a-dozen of them sauntering about.\r\nBut the most fearful-looking of all were two animals of a tawny red\r\ncolour, that lay in crouching attitudes within the porch, almost at the\r\nfeet of the woman.  Their round, cat-like heads and ears, their short\r\nblack muzzles, their white throats, and pale reddish breasts, told us\r\nwhat they were at a glance.\r\n\r\n\"Panthers!\" ejaculated my companion, drawing a long breath, and looking\r\nat me with a puzzled air.  Yes; they were panthers--so called by the\r\nhunters, but more properly cougars--the _felis concolor_ of the\r\nnaturalists--the lion of America.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all these fierce creatures, the two young girls were\r\nmoving about, apparently unconcerned at their presence, while the\r\nanimals appeared equally unconcerned about them!  The whole scene\r\nreminded us of the fanciful pictures, we had seen, of that time promised\r\nin the Sacred Book, when all the earth shall be at peace, and \"the lion\r\nshall lie down with the lamb.\"\r\n\r\nWe did not stop to see more.  We were satisfied, and went back for our\r\ncompanions.  In five minutes after, the whole of us entered the\r\nclearing, and rode up to the house.  Our sudden appearance produced\r\nconsternation on all sides.  The men shouted to each other--the horses\r\nneighed--the dogs howled and barked hoarsely--and the fowls mingled\r\ntheir voices in the clamour.  We were taken, no doubt, for a party of\r\nIndians; but we were not long in making it understood who and what we\r\nwere.  As soon as our explanations were given, the white man invited us,\r\nin the politest manner, to alight, and partake of his hospitality.  At\r\nthe same time he gave orders for our dinner to be prepared; and,\r\ndesiring us to lead our horses into one of the enclosures, he commenced\r\nthrowing corn into a large wooden trough.  In this he was assisted by\r\nthe negro, who was his servant, and the two young lads, who appeared to\r\nbe his sons.\r\n\r\nAs yet we had not ceased to wonder.  Everything around us was strange\r\nand inexplicable.  The animals, which none of us had ever seen, except\r\nin their wild state, were as tame and gentle as farm cattle; and we\r\nnoticed some new species at every turn.  There were strange plants too,\r\ngrowing in the fields and garden, and vines trained upon espaliers, and\r\ncorn-cribs filled with yellow corn, and dove-cotes, and martin-boxes,\r\nwith swallows twittering around them.  All formed a curious but pleasing\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nWe had sauntered about for an hour, when we were summoned to dinner.\r\n\r\n\"Follow me, gentlemen,\" said our host, as he led the way to the house.\r\nWe entered, and seated ourselves around a good-sized table, upon which\r\nsmoked several savoury and inviting dishes.  Some of these we recognised\r\nas old acquaintances, while others were new to us.  We found\r\nvenison-steaks, with buffalo tongues and hump-ribs,--the daintiest\r\nportions of that animal.  There were fresh-cooked fowls, and eggs of the\r\nwild turkey boiled and dressed in omelettes.  There were bread and\r\nbutter, and milk and rich cheese, all set out to tempt our appetites,\r\nthat, to say the truth, just at that time did not require much coaxing\r\nto do justice to the viands before us.  We were all quite hungry, for we\r\nhad eaten nothing since morning.  A large kettle simmered by the fire.\r\nWhat could it contain? thought we; surely, not tea or coffee.  In a\r\nshort time we were satisfied on this head.  Bowls were placed before us;\r\nand into these the hot liquid was poured, which we found to be a very\r\npalatable as well as wholesome beverage--the tea of the sassafras root.\r\nIt was sweetened by maple-sugar; and each helped himself to cream to his\r\nown liking.  We had all tasted such tea before, and many of our party\r\nliked it as well as the tea of China.\r\n\r\nWhile we continued to eat, we could not help noticing the strangeness of\r\neverything around us.  All the articles of furniture were of unique and\r\nrude description; and it was plain that most of them had been\r\nmanufactured upon the spot.  The vessels were of several sorts and of\r\ndifferent materials.  There were cups and dishes, and bowls cut out of\r\nshells of the gourd or calabash; and there were spoons and ladles of the\r\nsame material.  There were wooden platters and trays carved and scooped\r\nout of the solid tree.  And more numerous were the vessels of red\r\npottery, of different shapes and for different uses.  Of these there\r\nwere large pots for cooking, and jars for holding water, and jugs of\r\nvarious dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe chairs, too, were all of rude construction; but admirably adapted to\r\ntheir purpose.  Most of them were covered with raw-hide seats, which\r\nstretched up the back in a slanting line, and thus rendered them firm\r\nand commodious.  A few lighter ones--evidently intended as the furniture\r\nof the inner rooms--(there were but two in the house), had seats woven\r\nout of the leaves of the palmetto.\r\n\r\nThere was very little attempt at ornament upon the walls--if we except\r\nsome curiosities that were placed there, all of which were evidently the\r\nproductions of the valley itself.  There were stuffed birds of rare and\r\nbright plumage, and huge horns of animals, with two or three shells of\r\nthe land tortoise carefully polished.  There were no mirrors nor\r\npictures, and not a book to be seen, except _one_; that was a\r\nmedium-sized volume, placed on a small table by itself, and evidently\r\npreserved with great care as it had been neatly and elaborately bound in\r\nthe skin of a young antelope.  I had the curiosity to open this book,\r\nshortly after entering.  I read upon the title-page the words \"Holy\r\nBible.\"  This circumstance increased the interest I already felt in our\r\nhost and his family; and I sat down with feelings of confidence, for I\r\nknew that even in this remote place we were enjoying the hospitality of\r\na Christian.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal our host with his family were present.  We had seen them\r\nall on our arrival, for they had run forward to greet and welcome us;\r\nbut we became puzzled as we listened to the conversation of the\r\nchildren.  We heard with surprise that we were the first white men they\r\nhad seen for a period of nearly ten years!  They were all beautiful\r\nchildren--robust, and full of life and animation.  There were two boys--\r\nFrank and Harry,--so their mother called them--and two girls.  Of the\r\ngirls one was of a very dark complexion--in fact, quite a brunette, and\r\nwith a Spanish expression of face.  The other was as fair as her sister\r\nwas dark.  The fair one was a beautiful little creature with flowing\r\nyellow hair and deep blue eyes, with long, dark lashes.  Her name was\r\nMary.  That of the sister was Luisa.  They were both very pretty, but\r\nvery unlike each other; and, what was odd to me, they appeared to be\r\nabout the same age and size.  The boys were also of like size, though\r\nboth much older than their sisters.  They appeared to be seventeen or\r\nmore, but I could not have guessed which was the elder.  Harry, with his\r\nfair curling hair, and red manly face, bore a strong resemblance to his\r\nfather; while the other was darker, and altogether more like the mother.\r\nShe herself did not appear to be much over thirty-five years of age,\r\nand was still a beautiful and evidently a light-hearted woman.\r\n\r\nOur host was a man of about forty--a tall, well formed man, with light\r\nruddy complexion, and hair that had been fair and curling, but was now\r\nsomewhat grey.  He had neither beard nor whiskers; but, on the contrary,\r\nhis chin bore evidence that he had freshly shaved himself that very day;\r\nand his whole appearance was that of a man who regularly attended to the\r\nduties of the toilet.  There was also about him a gentlemanlike bearing;\r\nand his address and conversation soon convinced all of us that we were\r\nin the company of an educated man.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the whole family was peculiar.  The man himself wore a\r\nhunting-shirt and leggings of tanned deerskin, and not unlike that of\r\nour own hunters.  The boys were similarly attired, but we could see that\r\nthey had a sort of homespun linen garment underneath.  The female part\r\nof the family were dressed in clothes, part of which were of the same\r\nhomespun, and part of a fine skin, that of the fawn, dressed to the\r\nsoftness of a glove.  Several hats were lying about; and we noticed that\r\nthey were curiously fabricated from the leaves of the palmetto.\r\n\r\nWhile we were eating, the negro appeared at the door, and, looking in,\r\neyed us with glances of extreme curiosity.  He was a short, stout man,\r\nblack as jet, and apparently about forty years old.  His head was\r\ncovered with a thick crop of small curls, that appeared to form an even\r\nsurface, making the outline of the skull as round as a ball.  His teeth\r\nwere very large and white, and anything but fierce--as he showed them\r\nonly when he smiled, and that he did almost continually.  There was\r\nsomething very pleasing in the expression of his rich black eyes, which\r\nwere never at rest, but kept always rolling on both sides of his flat\r\nand expanded nose.\r\n\r\n\"Cudjo! drive out these animals,\" said the woman--or rather lady, we\r\nshould call her--for she was evidently entitled to be so styled.  Her\r\ncommand, or more properly request--for she had made it in that tone--was\r\nobeyed with alacrity.  Cudjo leaped into the floor, and, after a short\r\nwhile, succeeded in turning out the wolf-dogs, and panthers, and other\r\nstrange animals, that up to this time had been snarling at each other,\r\namong our feet, to the no small terror of several of our party.\r\n\r\nAll these things were so strange, that we watched them with interest and\r\ncuriosity.  At length our meal was ended; and as we were most anxious to\r\nhave everything explained to us, we signified this desire to our host.\r\n\r\n\"Wait until night,\" said he.  \"Around the cheerful log-fire I will tell\r\nyou my story.  Meanwhile you all need other refreshment than eating.\r\nCome to the lake then, and take a bath.  The sun is high and warm.  A\r\nbath will refresh you after your dusty travel.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he stepped out of the cottage, and proceeded towards the\r\nlake, followed by all our party.  A few minutes after, we were\r\nrefreshing ourselves in the crystal water.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the day, we occupied ourselves at different\r\nemployments.  Some went back to the mountain-foot for the mules and\r\nMexicans; while the rest of us strolled about the house and grounds--\r\nevery now and then stumbling upon some new object of wonder.\r\n\r\nWe were impatient for the coming of night, for we were wound up to a\r\npitch of extreme curiosity, and longed for an explanation of what we saw\r\naround us.\r\n\r\nNight came at length; and after an excellent supper, we all sat around\r\nthe cheerful fire, to listen to the strange history of Robert Rolfe--for\r\nthat was the name of our host.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nROLFE'S EARLY HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\"Brothers,\" began he, \"I am of your own race, although I am not an\r\nAmerican.  I am an Englishman.  I was born in the south of that country\r\nsomething more than forty years ago.  My father was a yeoman--an\r\nindependent, or, as he was sometimes styled, a gentleman-farmer.\r\nUnfortunately, he was a man of too much ambition for his class.  He was\r\ndetermined that I, his only son, should be a gentleman in the ordinary\r\nsense of the word; that is, that I should be educated in all those\r\nexpensive habits and accomplishments, which are sure to lead men of\r\nmoderate fortune along the direct road to ruin.  This was not wise of my\r\nfather; but it would not be graceful in me to reflect upon a fault, that\r\nconsisted in his too great fondness for myself.  I believe it was the\r\nonly fault which my good, kind father, was ever charged with.  Beyond\r\nthis somewhat foolish ambition, his character was without reproach among\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\"I was sent to those schools where I should meet the scions of the\r\naristocracy.  I was taught to dance, to ride, and to play.  I was\r\nallowed spending money at will, and could call for champagne, and drink\r\nit, with any of my companions.  At the end of my college life, I was\r\nsent upon my travels.  I made the tour of the Rhine, of France, and\r\nItaly; and after some years spent in this way, I returned to England--\r\nsent for, to be present at the death of my father.\r\n\r\n\"I was now sole heir to his property, which was by no means\r\ninconsiderable for a man of his class.  I soon reduced it in bulk.  I\r\nmust needs live in London, where I could enjoy the company of many of my\r\nold school and college companions.  I was welcome amongst them while my\r\npurse held out--for many of them were needy men--lawyers without briefs,\r\nand officers with nothing to live upon but their pay.  Of course, such\r\nmen are fond of play.  They have nothing to lose, and all to win; and it\r\nwas but a short year or two, until they had won from me the best part of\r\nmy patrimonial property.  I was on the eve of becoming a bankrupt.  But\r\none thing saved me--_she_ saved me!\"\r\n\r\nHere our host pointed to his wife, who sat surrounded by her family at\r\none side of the great fireplace.  The lady held down her eyes and\r\nsmiled; while the children, who had been listening attentively, all\r\nturned towards her with looks of interest.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued he, \"Mary saved me.  We had been playmates together in\r\nearlier life; and at this time we again met.  We felt an affection for\r\neach other.  It ended in our getting married.\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately, my dissipated life had not destroyed, as it often does\r\nwith men, all my virtuous principles.  Many of these, that had been\r\nearly instilled into my mind by the teachings of a good mother, still\r\nremained fixed and true.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as we were married, I resolved to change altogether my mode of\r\nlife.  But this is not so easily done as men imagine.  Once you are\r\nsurrounded by associates, such as mine were--once you are plunged into\r\ndebts and obligations--it requires both courage and virtuous\r\ndetermination to meet and discharge them.  It requires a terrible effort\r\nto free one's self from evil companions, whose interest it is, that you\r\nshould still remain as profligate as themselves.  But I was resolved;\r\nand, thanks to the counsels of my Mary, I succeeded in carrying out my\r\nresolve.\r\n\r\n\"To pay my debts, I was compelled to sell the property left me by my\r\nfather.  This done, and every bill discharged, I found myself worth only\r\nfive hundred pounds.\r\n\r\n\"My little wife, there, had brought me the sum of twenty-five hundred;\r\nand this still left us three thousand pounds with which to begin the\r\nworld.  Three thousand pounds is not much to live upon in England--that\r\nis, among the class of people with whom I had hitherto associated; and\r\nafter spending several years in trying to increase it, I found that it\r\nwas every day growing less.  I found, after three years engaged in\r\nfarming, that my three thousand pounds was only worth two.  I was told\r\nthat this sum would go much farther in America--that it would purchase\r\nme a fine home--and, with thoughts of providing well for my family, I\r\nembarked with my wife and children for New York.\r\n\r\n\"There I found the very man whom I wanted--that was, some one to advise\r\nme how to begin life in the New World.  My predilections were in favour\r\nof agriculture; and these were encouraged by the advice of him whom I\r\nhad met.  He told me that it would be unwise for me to lay out my money\r\nupon new or uncleared land; as, with my want of experience as a farmer,\r\nI would have to pay more for clearing it of its timber than the land\r\nwould be worth.  `It would be better for you,' continued my new\r\nacquaintance, `to buy a tract already cleared and fenced, with a good\r\nhouse upon it, where you will be at home at once.'\r\n\r\n\"I admitted the truth of all this reasoning; but would my money be\r\nsufficient for this?  `Oh, yes,' answered he; and then he told me that\r\nhe `knew of a farm in the State of Virginia,'--a plantation, as he\r\ncalled it, that would suit me exactly.  It could be purchased for five\r\nhundred pounds.  With the remainder of my money I should be able to\r\nstock it handsomely.\r\n\r\n\"After some farther conversation, I found that the plantation belonged\r\nto himself.  So much the better, thought I; and in the end I bought it\r\nfrom him, and set out immediately after for my new home.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE VIRGINIA PLANTATION.\r\n\r\n\"I found the farm everything he had described it--a large plantation\r\nwith a good wooden house, and well-enclosed fields.  I immediately set\r\nabout `stocking' it with my remaining cash.  What was my surprise to\r\nfind that I must spend the greater part of this in _buying men_!  Yes--\r\nthere was no alternative.  There were no labourers to be had in the\r\nplace--except such as were slaves--and these I must either buy for\r\nmyself, or hire from their masters, which, in point of morality,\r\namounted to the same thing.\r\n\r\n\"Thinking that I might treat them with at least as much humanity, as\r\nthey appeared to receive from others, I chose the former course; and\r\npurchasing a number of blacks, both men and women, I began life as a\r\nplanter.  After such a bargain as that, I did not deserve to prosper;\r\nand I did not prosper, as you shall see.\r\n\r\n\"My first crop failed; in fact, it scarcely returned me the seed.  The\r\nsecond was still worse; and to my mortification I now ascertained the\r\ncause of the failure.  I had come into possession of a `worn-out' farm.\r\nThe land looked well, and on sight you would have called it a fertile\r\ntract.  When I first saw it myself, I was delighted with my purchase--\r\nwhich seemed indeed a great bargain for the small sum of money I had\r\npaid.  But appearances are often deceptive; and never was there a\r\ngreater deception than my beautiful plantation in Virginia.  It was\r\nutterly worthless.  It had been cropped for many years with maize, and\r\ncotton, and tobacco.  These had been regularly carried off the land, and\r\nnot a stalk or blade suffered to return to the soil.  As a natural fact,\r\nknown to almost every one, the vegetable or organic matter will thus in\r\ntime become exhausted, and nothing will remain but inorganic or purely\r\nmineral substances, which of themselves cannot nourish vegetation, and\r\nof course can give no crop.  This is the reason why manure is spread\r\nupon land--the manure consisting of substances that are for the most\r\npart organic, and contain the principles of life and vegetation.  Of\r\ncourse, gentlemen, these things are known to you; but you will pardon my\r\ndigression, as my children are listening to me, and I never lose an\r\nopportunity of instructing them in facts that may hereafter be useful to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Well, as I have said, I had no crops, or rather very bad ones, for the\r\nfirst and second years.  On the third it was, if possible, still worse;\r\nand on the fourth and fifth no better than ever.  I need hardly add that\r\nby this time I was ruined, or very nearly so.  The expense of feeding\r\nand clothing my poor negroes had brought me in debt to a considerable\r\namount.  I could not have lived longer on my worthless plantation, even\r\nhad I desired it.  I was compelled, in order to pay my debts, to sell\r\nout everything--farm, cattle, and negroes.  No, I did not sell all.\r\nThere was one honest fellow to whom both Mary and I had become attached.\r\nI was resolved not to sell him into slavery.  He had served us\r\nfaithfully.  It was he who first told me how I had been tricked; and,\r\nsympathising in my misfortune, he endeavoured--both by industry on his\r\nown part, and by encouraging his fellow-labourers--to make the\r\nungrateful soil yield me a return.  His efforts had been vain, but I\r\ndetermined to repay him for his rude but honest friendship.  I gave him\r\nhis liberty.  He would not accept it.  He would not part from us.  He is\r\nthere!\"\r\n\r\nAs the narrator said this, he pointed to Cudjo, who stood hanging by the\r\ndoor-post; and, delighted at these compliments which were being paid\r\nhim, was showing his white teeth in a broad and affectionate smile.\r\n\r\nRolfe continued:--\r\n\r\n\"When the sale was completed, and the account settled, I found that I\r\nhad just five hundred pounds left.  I had now some experience in\r\nfarming; and I resolved to move out to the West--into the great valley\r\nof the Mississippi.  I knew that there my five hundred pounds would\r\nstill set me up again in a farm as big as I wanted, where the timber was\r\nstill growing upon it.\r\n\r\n\"Just at this time my eye fell upon some flaming advertisements in the\r\nnewspapers, about a new city which was then being built at the junction\r\nof the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.  It was called `Cairo,' and as it\r\nwas situated on the fork between two of the largest and most navigable\r\nrivers in the world, it could not fail in a few years to become one of\r\nthe largest cities in the world.  So said the advertisement.  There were\r\nmaps of the new city everywhere, and on these were represented theatres,\r\nand banks, and court-houses, and churches of different religious\r\ndenominations.  There were lots offered for sale, and, along with these,\r\nsmall tracts of land adjoining the town--so that the inhabitants might\r\ncombine the occupations of merchant and agriculturist.  These lots were\r\noffered very cheap, thought I; and I did not rest, night nor day, until\r\nI had purchased one of them, and also a small farm in the adjacent\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"Almost as soon as I had made the purchase, I set out to take\r\npossession.  Of course, I took with me my wife and children.  I had now\r\nthree--the two eldest being twins and about nine years old.  I did not\r\nintend to return to Virginia any more.  Our faithful Cudjo accompanied\r\nus to our far Western home.\r\n\r\n\"It was a severe journey, but not so severe as the trial that awaited us\r\non our arrival at `Cairo.'  As soon as I came within sight of the place,\r\nI saw, to use an expressive phrase, that I had been `sold' again.  There\r\nwas but one house, and that stood upon the only ground that was not a\r\nswamp.  Nearly the whole site of the proposed city was under water, and\r\nthe part not wholly inundated consisted of a dark morass, covered with\r\ntrees and tall reeds!  There were no theatres, no churches, no\r\ncourt-houses, no banks, nor any likelihood there ever would be, except\r\nsuch as might be built to keep back the water from the only house in the\r\nplace--a sort of rough hotel, filled with swearing boatmen.\r\n\r\n\"I had landed, of course; and, after putting up at the hotel, proceeded\r\nin search of my `property.'  I found my town-lot in a marsh, which took\r\nme over the ankles in mud.  As for my farm, I was compelled to get a\r\nboat to visit it; and after sailing all over it without being able to\r\ntouch bottom, I returned to the hotel, heartless and disgusted.\r\n\r\n\"By the next steamboat that came along, I embarked for Saint Louis--\r\nwhere I sold both lot and farm for a mere trifle.\r\n\r\n\"I need not say that I was mortified at all this.  I was almost\r\nheart-broken when I reflected on my repeated failures, and thought of my\r\nyoung wife and children.  I could have bitterly cursed both America and\r\nthe Americans, had that been of any use; and yet such a thing would have\r\nbeen as unjust as immoral.  It is true I had been twice outrageously\r\nswindled; but the same thing had happened to me in my own country, and I\r\nhad suffered in the same way by those who professed to be my friends.\r\nThere are bad men in every country--men willing to take advantage of\r\ngenerosity and inexperience.  It does not follow that all are so; and we\r\nhope far less than the half--for it must be remembered that the bad\r\npoints of one country are more certain to be heard of in another than\r\nits good ones.  When I look to the schemes and speculations which have\r\nbeen got up in England, and which have enriched a few accomplished\r\nrogues, by the ruin of thousands of honest men, I cannot, as an\r\nEnglishman, accuse our American cousins of being greater swindlers than\r\nourselves.  It is true I have been deceived by them, but it was from the\r\nwant of proper judgment in myself, arising from a foolish and\r\nill-directed education.  I should have been equally ill-treated in the\r\npurchase of a horse at Tattersall's, or a pound of tea in Piccadilly,\r\nhad I been equally unacquainted with the value of the articles.  We\r\nboth, as nations, have erred.  Neither of us can, with grace, cast a\r\nstone at the other; and as for myself, why, look there!\" said Rolfe,\r\nsmiling and pointing to his family, \"two of my children only are\r\nEnglishmen; the others are little Yankees.  Almost every Englishman can\r\nsay something similar.  Why, then, should we sow jealousy between them?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE CARAVAN AND ITS FATE.\r\n\r\nOur host continued:--\r\n\r\n\"Well, my friends, I was in Saint Louis.  I had now left out of my three\r\nthousand pounds not quite an hundred; and this would soon melt away\r\nshould I remain idle.  What was I to do?\r\n\r\n\"There happened to be a young Scotchman at the hotel where I had put up.\r\nHe was, like myself, a stranger in Saint Louis; and being from the `old\r\ncountry,' we soon became acquainted, and, very naturally under the\r\ncircumstances, shared each other's confidence.  I told him of my\r\nblunders in Virginia and Cairo, and I believe that he really felt\r\nsympathy for me.  In return, he detailed to me part of his past history,\r\nand also his plans for the future.  He had been for several years\r\nemployed in a copper mine, away near the centre of the Great American\r\nDesert, in the mountains called Los Mimbres, that lie west of the Del\r\nNorte river.\r\n\r\n\"They are a wonderful people these same Scotch.  They are but a small\r\nnation, yet their influence is felt everywhere upon the globe.  Go where\r\nyou will, you will find them in positions of trust and importance--\r\nalways prospering, yet, in the midst of prosperity, still remembering,\r\nwith strong feelings of attachment, the land of their birth.  They\r\nmanage the marts of London--the commerce of India--the fur trade of\r\nAmerica--and the mines of Mexico.  Over all the American wilderness you\r\nwill meet them, side by side with the backwoods-pioneer himself, and\r\neven pushing him from his own ground.  From the Gulf of Mexico to the\r\nArctic Sea, they have impressed with their Gaelic names rock, river, and\r\nmountain; and many an Indian tribe owns a Scotchman for its chief.  I\r\nsay, again, they are a wonderful people.\r\n\r\n\"Well; my Saint Louis Scotchman had come from his mine upon a visit of\r\nbusiness to the United States, and was now on his return by Saint Louis\r\nand Santa Fe.  His wife was along with him--a fine-looking, young\r\nMexican woman, with only one child.  He was waiting for a small caravan\r\nof Spanish people, who were about to start for New Mexico.  With these\r\nhe intended to travel, so as to be in safety from the Indians along the\r\nroute.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as he understood my situation, he advised me to accompany him--\r\noffering me a lucrative situation in the mine, of which he was the sole\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\n\"Disgusted as I then was with the treatment I had received in the United\r\nStates, I embraced his proposal with alacrity; and, under his\r\nsuperintendence, I set about making preparations for the long journey\r\nthat lay before us.  The money I had left, enabled me to equip myself in\r\na tolerable manner.  I bought a wagon and two pair of stout oxen.  This\r\nwas to carry my wife and children, with such furniture and provisions as\r\nwould be necessary on the journey.  I had no need to hire a teamster, as\r\nour faithful Cudjo was to accompany us, and I knew there was no better\r\nhand to manage a team of oxen than Cudjo.  For myself I purchased a\r\nhorse, a rifle, with all the paraphernalia that are required by those\r\nwho cross the great prairies.  My boys, Harry and Frank, had also a\r\nsmall rifle each, which we had brought with us from Virginia: and Harry\r\nwas very proud of the manner in which he could handle his.\r\n\r\n\"Everything being prepared, we bade adieu to Saint Louis, and set forth\r\nupon the wild prairies.\r\n\r\n\"Ours was but a small caravan, as the large one which crosses annually\r\nto Santa Fe had taken its departure some weeks before.  There were about\r\ntwenty men of us, and less than half that number of wagons.  The men\r\nwere nearly all Mexicans, who had been to the United States to procure\r\nsome pieces of cannon, for which they had been sent by the governor of\r\nSanta Fe.  They had the cannon along with them--two brass howitzers,\r\nwith their carriages and caissons.\r\n\r\n\"My friends, I need not tell you the various incidents that befell us,\r\nin crossing the great plains and rivers that lie between Saint Louis and\r\nSanta Fe.  Upon the plains we fell in with the Pawnees; and near the\r\ncrossing of the Arkansas, we encountered a small tribe of Cheyennes; but\r\nneither of these bands offered us any molestation.  When we were nearly\r\ntwo months on our journey, the party left the usual trail taken by the\r\ntraders, and struck across to one of the head tributaries of the\r\nCanadian river.  This they did to avoid meeting the Arapahoes, who were\r\nhostile to the Mexican people.  We kept down the banks of this stream as\r\nfar as the Canadian itself; and, then turning westward, travelled up the\r\nlatter.  We travelled upon the right or southern bank, for we had forded\r\nthe Canadian on reaching it.\r\n\r\n\"It soon became apparent that we had got into a very rough and difficult\r\ncountry.  It was the morning of the second day, after we had turned\r\nwestward up the Canadian river.  We were making but slow progress, as\r\nthe trail we had to follow was intersected at frequent intervals with\r\n`arroyos' running into the river from the south.  Many of these were\r\ndeep ditches, although quite dry; and every now and then we were\r\ncompelled to stop the whole train until we levelled in the banks, and\r\nmade a road for the wagons to pass.\r\n\r\n\"In crossing one of these ruts, the tongue of my wagon was broken; and\r\nCudjo and I, having loosed out the oxen, set about splicing it the best\r\nway we could.  The rest of the train was ahead of us, and kept moving\r\non.  My friend, the young Scotchman, seeing that we had stopped, came\r\ngalloping back, and offered to remain and assist us.  I declined his\r\noffer, telling him to move on with the rest, as I would easily overtake\r\nthem; at all events, I would get up, whenever they halted for their\r\nnight camp.  It was not unfrequent for a single wagon, with its\r\nattendants, thus to stay behind the rest, to make some repairs.  When it\r\ndid not come up to the night encampment, a party would go back early the\r\nnext morning to ascertain the cause of the delay.  For several years,\r\nbefore the time I am telling you about, there had been no trouble with\r\nthe Indians in crossing the prairies; and consequently the people of the\r\ncaravans had grown less cautious.  Besides, we were then in a part of\r\nthe country where Indians had been seldom seen--as it was an extremely\r\ndesert place, without grass or game of any description.  On this\r\naccount--and knowing that Cudjo was an excellent carpenter--I had no\r\nfears but that I could be up with the others before night.  So, by my\r\npersuasion, the young Scotchman left me, and rode on to look after his\r\nown wagons.\r\n\r\n\"After about an hour's hammering and splicing, Cudjo and I got the\r\ntongue all right again; and `hitching up' the oxen, we drove on after\r\nour companions.  We had not gone a mile, when the shoeing of one of the\r\nwheels--that had shrunk from the extreme dryness of the atmosphere--\r\nrolled off; and the felloes came very near flying asunder.  We were\r\nluckily able to prevent this, by suddenly stopping, and setting a prop\r\nunder the body of the wagon.  This, as you may perceive, was a much more\r\nserious accident than the breaking of the tongue; and at first I thought\r\nof galloping forward, and asking some of our companions to come back to\r\nmy assistance.  But in consequence of my inexperience upon the prairies,\r\nI knew that I had given them considerable trouble along the route, at\r\nwhich some of them had murmured--being Mexicans--and in one or two\r\ninstances had refused to assist me.  I might bring back the young\r\nScotchman, it was true, but--`Come!' cried I, `it is not yet as bad as\r\nCairo.  Come, Cudjo! we shall do it ourselves, and be indebted to no\r\none.'\r\n\r\n\"`Dat's right, Massa Roff!' replied Cudjo; `ebery man put him own\r\nshoulder to him own wheel, else de wheel no run good.'\r\n\r\n\"And so the brave fellow and I stripped off our coats, and set to work\r\nin earnest.  My dear Mary here, who had been brought up a delicate lady,\r\nbut could suit herself gracefully to every situation, helped us all she\r\ncould, cheering us every now and then with an allusion to Cairo, and our\r\nfarm under the water.  It has always a comforting effect, to persons in\r\nsituations of difficulty to reflect that they might still be worse off,\r\nand such reflections will often prop up the drooping spirits, and lead\r\nto success in conquering the difficulty.  `Never give up' is a good old\r\nmotto, and God will help them who show perseverance and energy.\r\n\r\n\"So did it happen with us.  By dint of wedging and hammering we\r\nsucceeded in binding the wheel as fast as ever; but it was near night\r\nbefore we had finished the job.  When we had got it upon the axle again,\r\nand were ready for the road, we saw, with some apprehension, that the\r\nsun was setting.  We knew we could not travel by night, not knowing what\r\nroad to take; and, as we were close to water, we resolved to stay where\r\nwe were until morning.\r\n\r\n\"We were up before day, and, having cooked and eaten our breakfast,\r\nmoved forward upon the track made by the caravan.  We wondered that none\r\nof our companions had come back during the night--as this is usual in\r\nsuch cases,--but we expected _every_ moment to meet some of them\r\nreturning to look after us.  We travelled on, however, until noon, and\r\nstill none of them appeared.  We could see before us a rough tract of\r\ncountry with rocky hills, and some trees growing in the valleys; and the\r\ntrail we were following evidently led among these.\r\n\r\n\"As we pushed forward, we heard among the hills a loud crashing report\r\nlike the bursting of a bombshell.  What could it mean?  We knew there\r\nwere some shells along with the howitzers.  Were our comrades attacked\r\nby Indians, and was it one of the cannon they had fired upon them?  No;\r\nthat could not be.  There was but one report, and I knew that the\r\ndischarge of a shell from a howitzer must give two,--that which\r\naccompanies the discharge, and then the bursting of the bomb itself.\r\nCould one of the shells have burst by accident?  That was more likely;\r\nand we halted, and listened for further sounds.  We stopped for nearly\r\nhalf an hour, but could hear nothing, and we then moved on again.  We\r\nwere filled with apprehension--less from the report we had heard, than\r\nfrom the fact that none of the men had come back to see what delayed us.\r\nWe still followed the track of the wagons.  We saw that they must have\r\nmade a long march on the preceding day, for it was near sunset when we\r\nentered among the hills, and as yet we had not reached their camp of the\r\nnight before.  At length we came in sight of it,--and oh! horror! what a\r\nsight!  My blood runs cold when I recall it to my memory.  There were\r\nthe wagons--most of them with their tilts torn off, and part of their\r\ncontents scattered over the ground.  There were the cannons too, with\r\nfires smouldering near them, but not a human being was in sight!  Yes,\r\nthere were human beings--dead men lying over the ground! and living\r\nthings--wolves they were--growling, and quarrelling, and tearing the\r\nflesh from their bodies!  Some of the animals that had belonged to the\r\ncaravan were also prostrate--dead horses, mules, and oxen.  The others\r\nwere not to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"We were all horror-struck at the sight.  We saw at once that our\r\ncompanions had been attacked and slaughtered by some band of savage\r\nIndians.  We would have retreated, but it was now too late, for we were\r\nclose in to the camp, before we had seen it.  Had the savages still been\r\nupon the ground, retreat would be of no avail.  But I knew that they\r\nmust have gone some time, from the havoc the wolves had made in their\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\n\"I left my wife by our wagon, where Harry and Frank remained with their\r\nlittle rifles ready to guard her, and along with Cudjo I went forward to\r\nview the bloody scene.  We chased the wolves from their repast.  There\r\nwas a pack of more than fifty of these hideous animals, and they only\r\nran a short distance from us.  On reaching the ground we saw that the\r\nbodies were those of our late comrades, but they were all so mutilated\r\nthat we could not distinguish a single one of them.  They had every one\r\nbeen scalped by the Indians; and it was fearful to look upon them as\r\nthey lay.  I saw the fragments of one of the shells that had burst in\r\nthe middle of the camp, and had torn two or three of the wagons to\r\npieces.  There had not been many articles of merchandise in the wagons,\r\nas it was not a traders' caravan; but such things as they carried, that\r\ncould be of any value to the Indians, had been taken away.  The other\r\narticles, most of them heavy and cumbersome things, were lying over the\r\nground, some of them broken.  It was evident the savages had gone off in\r\na hurry.  Perhaps they had been frightened by the bursting of the shell,\r\nnot knowing what it was, and from its terrible effects--which they no\r\ndoubt witnessed and felt--believing it to be the doing of the Great\r\nSpirit.\r\n\r\n\"I looked on all sides for my friend, the young Scotchman, but I could\r\nnot distinguish his body from the rest.  I looked around, too, for his\r\nwife--who was the only woman besides Mary that accompanied the caravan.\r\nHer body was not to be seen.  `No doubt,' said I to Cudjo, `the savages\r\nhave carried her off alive.'  At this moment we heard the howls and\r\nhoarse worrying of dogs, with the fiercer snarling of wolves, as though\r\nthe dogs were battling with these animals.  The noises came from a\r\nthicket near the camp.  We knew that the miner had brought with him two\r\nlarge dogs from Saint Louis.  It must be they.  We ran in the direction\r\nof the thicket, and dashed in among the bushes.  Guided by the noises,\r\nwe kept on, and soon came in sight of the objects that had attracted us.\r\nTwo large dogs, foaming and torn and covered with blood, were battling\r\nagainst several wolves, and keeping them off from some dark object that\r\nlay among the leaves.  We saw that the dark object was a woman, and\r\nclinging around her neck, and screaming with terror, was a beautiful\r\nchild!  At a glance we saw that the woman was dead, and--\"\r\n\r\nHere the narrative of our host was suddenly interrupted.  McKnight, the\r\nminer, who was one of our party, and who had appeared labouring under\r\nsome excitement during the whole of the recital, suddenly sprang to his\r\nfeet, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\"O God! my wife--my poor wife!  Oh!  Rolfe--Rolfe--do you not know me?\"\r\n\r\n\"McKnight!\" cried Rolfe, springing up with an air of astonishment,\r\n\"McKnight! it is he indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"My wife!--my poor wife!\" continued the miner, in accents of sorrow.  \"I\r\nknew they had killed her.  I saw her remains afterwards--but my child!\r\nOh, Rolfe! what of my child?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is _there_!\" said our host, pointing to the darkest of the two\r\ngirls, and the next moment the miner had lifted the little Luisa in his\r\narms, and was covering her with his kisses.  He was her father!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE MINER'S STORY.\r\n\r\nIt would be very difficult, my young readers, to describe to you the\r\nscene which followed this unexpected recognition.  The family had all\r\nrisen to their feet, and with cries and tears in their eyes clung around\r\nthe little Luisa as though they were about to lose her for ever.  And,\r\nindeed, it is likely that an indistinct thought of this kind had flitted\r\nacross their minds, when they saw that she was no longer their sister--\r\nfor they had almost forgotten that she was not so, and they loved her as\r\nwell as if she had been.  Up to this time none of them had thought of\r\nher but as a sister; and Harry, with whom she was a great favourite,\r\nused to call her his \"dark sister,\" while the younger, Mary, was known\r\nas the \"fair\" one in the midst of the group stood the little brunette,\r\nlike the rest, overwhelmed with singular emotions, but calmer, and\r\napparently more mistress of her feelings, than any of them.\r\n\r\nThe traders and hunters were all upon their feet congratulating McKnight\r\non the happy discovery; while each of them shook hands with our host and\r\nhis wife, whom they now remembered having heard of, as well as the story\r\nof the massacre.  Old Cudjo leaped over the floor, whipping the panthers\r\nand wolf-dogs, and cutting various capers, while the very animals\r\nthemselves howled with a sort of fierce joy.  Our host went into an\r\ninner apartment of the cabin, and presently returned with a large jar of\r\nbrown earthenware.  Cups cut out of the calabash were set upon the\r\ntable; and into these a red liquid was poured from the jar, and we were\r\nall invited to drink.  What was our surprise on tasting the beverage to\r\nfind that it was wine--wine in the middle of the desert!  But it was\r\nso--excellent wine--homemade, as our host informed us--pressed from the\r\nwild muscadine grapes that grew plentifully in his valley.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had all passed the cups of wine, and had got fairly seated\r\nagain, McKnight, at the request of Rolfe, took up the thread of the\r\nstory, in order to detail how he had escaped from the Indians on that\r\nfearful night.  His story was a short one and ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"After I left you,\" said he, addressing Rolfe, \"where you had broken\r\nyour wagon, I rode on, and overtook the caravan.  The road, as you may\r\nremember, became smooth and level; and as there appeared to be no good\r\ncamping-ground nearer than the hills, we kept on for them without\r\nstopping.  It was near sundown, when we reached the little stream where\r\nyou saw the wagons.  There, of course, we halted, and formed our camp.\r\nI did not expect you to come in for an hour or so later, as I calculated\r\nthat it would take you about that length of time to mend the tongue.  We\r\nkindled fires, and, having cooked our supper and eaten it, were sitting\r\naround the logs chatting, smoking, and some of the Mexicans, as is their\r\ncustom, playing at _monte_.  We had put out no guard, as we had no\r\nexpectation that there were Indians in that quarter.  Some of the men\r\nsaid they had travelled the trail before; and had never met an Indian\r\nwithin fifty miles of the place.  At length it became dark, and I began\r\nto grow uneasy about you, fearing you might not be able to make out our\r\ntrail in the night.  Leaving my wife and child by one of the fires I\r\nclimbed a hill that looked in the direction you should have come; but I\r\ncould see nothing for the darkness.  I stood for some time listening,\r\nthinking I might hear the rattle of your wheels, or some one of you\r\ntalking.  All at once a yell broke upon my ears, that caused me to turn\r\ntoward the camp with a feeling of consternation.  I well knew the\r\nmeaning of that yell.  I knew it was the war-cry of the Arapahoes.  I\r\nsaw savage figures dashing about in the red glare of the fires.  I heard\r\nshots and shouts, and screams and groans; and, among the rest, I\r\nrecognised the voice of my wife calling me by name!\r\n\r\n\"I did not hesitate a moment, but ran down the hill, and flung myself\r\ninto the thick of the fight, which was now raging fiercely.  I had\r\nnothing with which to arm myself but a large knife, with which I struck\r\non all sides, prostrating several of the savages.  Here I fought for a\r\nmoment, and there I ran, calling for my wife.  I passed through among\r\nthe wagons, and on all sides of the camp crying, `Luisa!'  There was no\r\nanswer; she was nowhere to be seen.  Again I was face to face with\r\npainted savages, and battling with desperation.  Most of my comrades\r\nwere soon killed, and I was forced among the bushes, and into the\r\ndarkness, by one of the Indians, who pressed upon me with his spear.  I\r\nfelt the weapon pass through my thigh, and I fell impaled upon the\r\nshaft.  The Indian fell above me; but, before he could struggle up\r\nagain, I had thrust him through with my knife, and he lay senseless.\r\n\r\n\"I rose to my feet, and succeeded in drawing out the spear.  I saw that\r\nthe struggle had ceased around the fires; and, believing that my\r\ncomrades, as well as my wife and child, were all dead, I turned my back\r\nupon the fires, and stole off into the thicket, determined to get as far\r\nas possible from the camp.  I had not gone more than three hundred yards\r\nwhen I fell, exhausted with the loss of blood and the pain of my wound.\r\nI had fallen near some rocks at the bottom of a precipice, where I saw\r\nthere was a small crevice or cave.  I had still strength enough left to\r\nenable me to reach this cave, and crawl into it; but I fainted as soon\r\nas the effort was over.\r\n\r\n\"I must have lain insensible for many hours.  When I came to\r\nconsciousness again, I saw that daylight was shining into the cave.  I\r\nfelt that I was very weak, and could scarcely move.  My ghastly wound\r\nstared me in the face,--still undressed, but the blood had ceased\r\nflowing of its own accord.  I tore up my shirt, and dressed it as well\r\nas I was able; and then, getting nearer to the mouth of the cave, I lay\r\nand listened.  I could hear the voices of the Indians, though very\r\nindistinctly, in the direction of the camp.  This continued for an hour\r\nor more; and then the rocks rang with a terrible explosion, which I knew\r\nto be the bursting of a shell.  After that I could hear loud shouts, and\r\nsoon after, the hurried trampling of many horses; and then all was\r\nsilence.  I thought at the time that the Indians had taken their\r\ndeparture; but I knew not what had caused them to go off in such a\r\nhurry.  I found out afterwards.  Your conjecture was right.  They had\r\nthrown one of the bombs into the fire, and the fuse catching, had caused\r\nit to explode, killing several of their number.  As they believed it to\r\nbe the hand of the Great Spirit, they had hastily gathered up such\r\nplunder as was most desirable to them, and ridden away from the spot.  I\r\ndid not know this at the time, and I lay still in my cave.  For several\r\nhours all was silence; but, as night drew near, I fancied I again heard\r\nnoises about the camp, and I thought the Indians might not yet be gone.\r\n\r\n\"When darkness came, I would have crawled toward the camp, but I could\r\nnot; and I lay all night in the cave, chafing with the pain of my wound,\r\nand listening to the howling of the wolves.  That was a terrible night.\r\n\r\n\"Morning dawned again, and I could hear no sounds.  I was now suffering\r\ndreadfully, both from hunger and thirst.  I saw a well-known tree\r\ngrowing in front of the cave.  I knew it, because the same tree is found\r\nupon the mountains of the Mimbres, near our mine.  It was a species of\r\npine, called by the Mexicans `pinon,' whose cones afford food to\r\nthousands of the miserable savages who roam over the great western\r\nDesert from the Rocky Mountains to California.  If I could only reach\r\nthis tree, I might find some of its nuts upon the ground; and, with this\r\nhope, I dragged myself painfully out of the cave.  It was not twenty\r\npaces from the rocks where the tree grew; yet, with my weakness and the\r\npain of my wound, I was nearly half an hour in reaching it.  To my joy,\r\nI found the ground under it covered with cones.  I was not long in\r\nstripping off the rinds of many of them, and getting the seeds, which I\r\nate greedily, until I had satisfied my hunger.\r\n\r\n\"But another appetite far more terrible was craving me--I was tortured\r\nwith thirst.  Could I crawl as far as the camp?  I knew that there I\r\nshould find water in the stream; and, from the position of the cave, I\r\nknew I could not find it nearer.  I must either reach it or die; and,\r\nwith this thought to spur me on, I commenced the short journey of three\r\nhundred yards, although I was not certain I might live to see the end of\r\nit.  I had not crawled six paces through the underwood, when a bunch of\r\nsmall white flowers attracted my attention.  They were the flowers of\r\nthe sorrel-tree--the beautiful lyonia--the very sight of which sent a\r\nthrill of gladness through my heart.  I was soon under the tree, and,\r\nclutching one of its lowermost branches, I stripped it of its smooth,\r\nserrated leaves, and eagerly chewed them.  Another and another branch\r\nwere successively divested of their foliage, until the little tree\r\nlooked as if a flock of goats had been breakfasting upon it.  I lay for\r\nnearly an hour masticating the soft leaves, and swallowing their\r\ndelicious and acid juice.  At length my thirst was alleviated, and I\r\nfell asleep under the cool shadow of the lyonia.\r\n\r\n\"When I awoke again, I felt much stronger, and with new appetite to eat.\r\nThe fever which had begun to threaten me was much allayed; and I knew\r\nthis was to be attributed to the virtue of the leaves I had eaten--for\r\nbesides relieving thirst, the sap of the sorrel-tree is a most potent\r\nfebrifuge.  Gathering a fresh quantity of the leaves, and tying them\r\ntogether, I again set out for the pinon-tree.  I took the leaves with\r\nme, so that I should not have to make the return trip to the sorrel that\r\nnight again.  In a few minutes I had reached the end of my journey, and\r\nwas busy among the cones.  You laugh at my calling it a journey; but I\r\nassure you it was a most painful one to me, although it was not ten\r\npaces from one tree to the other.  The slightest motion agonised me.\r\n\r\n\"That night I passed under the pinon, and in the morning, having made my\r\nbreakfast of the seeds, I collected my pockets full, and set out again\r\nfor the sorrel-tree.  Here I spent the day; and with a fresh cargo of\r\nleaves returned at night to the pinon, where I again slept.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, for four successive days and nights, I passed between these two\r\nbrave trees, living upon the sustenance they afforded.  The fever was\r\nluckily warded off by the leaves of the friendly lyonia.  My wound began\r\nto heal, and the pain left it.  The wolves came at intervals; but,\r\nseeing my long knife, and that I still lived, they kept at a wary\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\"Although the leaves of the sorrel assuaged my thirst, they did not\r\nsatisfy it.  I longed for a good draught of water; and, on the fourth\r\nday, I set out for the stream.  I was now able to creep upon my hands\r\nand one knee, dragging the wounded limb after me.  When I had got about\r\nhalf-way through the underwood, I came upon an object that almost\r\ncongealed the blood in my veins.  It was a human skeleton.  I knew it\r\nwas not that of a man--I knew it was--\"\r\n\r\nHere the voice of the miner became choked with sobs, and he was unable\r\nto finish the sentence.  Nearly all in the room--even the rude hunters--\r\nwept as they beheld his emotion.  After an effort he continued:--\r\n\r\n\"I saw that she had been buried; and I wondered at this, for I knew the\r\nIndians had not done it.  I was never certain until this hour who had\r\nperformed for her that sacred rite.  I thought, however, it must have\r\nbeen you; for after I had recovered I went back upon the trail; and, not\r\nfinding your wagon anywhere, I knew you must have come on to the camp,\r\nand gone away again.  I looked in every direction to find which way you\r\nhad gone; but, as you will remember, there was a heavy fall of rain\r\nshortly after, and that had obliterated every track.  All this happened\r\nafter I was able to get upon my feet, which was not for a month after\r\nthe night of the massacre.  But let me go back in my narrative to where\r\nI had found the remains of my poor wife.\r\n\r\n\"The wolves had torn the body from its grave.  I looked for some vestige\r\nof my child.  With my hands I dug down into the loose mould and leaves,\r\nwhich you had thrown over her body; but no infant was there.  I crawled\r\non to the camp.  I found that, just as you have described it--except\r\nthat the bodies were now bleaching skeletons, and the wolves had taken\r\ntheir departure.  I searched around, on all sides, thinking I might find\r\nsome traces of my little Luisa; but in vain.  `The Indians have either\r\ncarried the child away,' thought I, `or the fierce wolves have devoured\r\nit altogether.'\r\n\r\n\"In one of the wagons I found an old mess-chest lying hid under some\r\nrubbish.  It had escaped the hurried plunder of the savages.  On opening\r\nit, I saw that it contained, among other things, some coffee and several\r\npounds of jerked meat.  This was a fortunate event, for the meat and\r\ncoffee nourished me, until I was able to gather a sufficient quantity of\r\nthe pinons.\r\n\r\n\"In this way I spent a whole month, sleeping in one of the wagons at\r\nnight, and crawling off to collect pinons during the day.  I had but\r\nlittle fear that the Indians would return; for I knew that that part of\r\nthe country was not inhabited by any tribe; and we must have fallen in\r\nwith a party of the Arapahoes, wandering out of their usual range.  As\r\nsoon as I grew strong enough, I dug a grave, where I interred the\r\nremains of my poor wife; and now I began to think of taking my leave of\r\nthat melancholy scene.\r\n\r\n\"I knew that I was not much more than a hundred miles distant from the\r\neastern settlements of New Mexico; but a hundred miles of uninhabited\r\nwilderness, and on foot, was a barrier that seemed almost as impassable\r\nas the ocean itself.  I was determined, however, to make the attempt;\r\nand I set about sewing a bag in which I should carry my roasted pinons--\r\nthe only provision I could get to sustain me through the journey.\r\n\r\n\"While engaged in this operation, with my eyes fixed upon the work, I\r\nheard footsteps near me.  I raised my head suddenly, and in alarm.  What\r\nwas my joy, when I saw that the object which had startled me was neither\r\nmore nor less than a mule, that was slowly coming towards the camp!  I\r\nrecognised it as one of the mules that had belonged to our caravan.\r\n\r\n\"The animal had not yet observed me; and I thought it might shy away, if\r\nI showed myself too suddenly.  I resolved, therefore, to capture it by\r\nstratagem.  I crept into the wagon, where I knew there was a lazo; and\r\nhaving got hold of this, I placed myself in ambush, where I saw the mule\r\nwould most likely pass.  I had scarcely got the noose ready, when, to my\r\nextreme satisfaction, the mule came directly to where I lay expecting\r\nit.  The next moment its neck was firmly grasped in the loop of the\r\nlazo, and the animal itself stood tied to the tongue of one of the\r\nwagons.  It was one of our mules that had escaped from the Indians, and\r\nafter wandering over the country for weeks had now found the track, and\r\nwould, no doubt, had I not caught it, have found its way back to Saint\r\nLouis; for this is by no means an unfrequent occurrence with animals\r\nthat stray off from the caravans.  It soon became tame with me, and in a\r\nfew days more I had manufactured a bridle and saddle; and, mounting with\r\nmy bag of roasted pinons, I rode off on the trail for Santa Fe.  In\r\nabout a week I reached that place in safety, and continued my journey\r\nsouthward to the mine.\r\n\r\n\"My history since that time can have but little interest for any of you.\r\nIt is that of a man sorrowing for the loss of all he loved on earth.\r\nBut you, Rolfe, you have given me new life in restorer; to me my child,\r\nmy Luisa; and every chapter of your history, woven as it is with hers,\r\nwill be to me, at least, of the deepest interest.  Go on then,--go on!\"\r\n\r\nWith this the miner concluded; and our host, after inviting each of us\r\nto re-fill our cups with wine, and our pipes with tobacco, resumed his\r\nnarrative where he had left it off, in consequence of the happy, but\r\nunexpected episode, to which it had led.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nLOST IN THE DESERT.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my friends,\" proceeded our host, \"it was a terrible sight to look\r\nupon--those fierce, gaunt wolves--the mad and foaming mastiffs--the dead\r\nmother, and the terrified and screaming child.  Of course, the wolves\r\nfled at the approach of myself and Cudjo, and the dogs whimpered with\r\ndelight.  Well they might, poor brutes! for had we not come to their\r\naid, they could not have held out much longer against such fearful odds.\r\nAlthough the battle had not been a long one, and commenced most likely\r\nafter we had driven the wolves from the camp, yet the poor mastiffs were\r\ntorn and bleeding in many places.  As I stooped down to take up the\r\nlittle Luisa, she still clung close around the neck of her mother,\r\ncrying for her `mamma' to awake.  I saw that her mamma would never wake\r\nagain.  She was lifeless and cold.  There was an arrow in her breast.\r\nIt was plain, that after receiving this wound she had fled into the\r\nthicket--no doubt followed by the faithful dogs--and, favoured by the\r\ndarkness, had kept on, until she had fallen and died.  The position of\r\nher arms showed that she had breathed her last clasping her child to her\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n\"Leaving Cudjo to guard the body, I carried the child back to my own\r\nwagon.  Although so lately terrified with the battle of the wolves and\r\ndogs, the little creature cried at being separated from its mother, and\r\nstruggled in my arms to be taken back.\"\r\n\r\nHere Rolfe's narrative was again interrupted by the sobs of McKnight,\r\nwho--although a firm, lion-hearted man--could not restrain himself on\r\nlistening to these painfully affecting details.  The children of Rolfe,\r\ntoo, repeatedly wept aloud.  The \"dark sister\" herself seemed least\r\naffected of all.  Perhaps that terrible scene, occurring at such an\r\nearly period of her life, had impressed her character with the firmness\r\nand composure which afterwards marked it.  Every now and then she bent\r\ntowards the \"fair one,\" throwing her arms around the neck of the latter,\r\nand endeavouring to restrain her tears.\r\n\r\n\"I gave the child to my wife,\" continued Rolfe, after a pause, \"and in\r\nthe company of little Mary, then about her own age, she soon ceased\r\ncrying, and fell asleep in my wife's bosom.  I took a spade which I had\r\nin my wagon, and going back dug a grave; and, with the help of Cudjo,\r\nhastily interred the body.  I say _hastily_, for we did not know the\r\nmoment we might stand in need of some one to do as much for ourselves.\r\nIt seems that our labour was in vain; yet even had we known this was to\r\nbe the case, we should not the less have acted as we did.  There was\r\nsome satisfaction in performing this last sacred and Christian ceremony\r\nfor our murdered friend; and both Cudjo and I felt it to be nothing more\r\nthan our duty.\r\n\r\n\"We did not remain any longer near the spot, but hastening back to our\r\nwagon, I led the oxen in among some trees, where they might be hidden\r\nfrom view.  Commending my wife and little ones to God, I shouldered my\r\nrifle, and set out--for the purpose of discovering whether the savages\r\nhad left the place, and in what direction they had gone.  It was my\r\nintention, should I be able to satisfy myself about the road they had\r\ntaken, to go by some other course, yet by one that would bring me back\r\ninto the trail, so that I could go on to the country of New Mexico.  I\r\nknew very well that at that late season, and with oxen worn-out, as ours\r\nwere, I could never get back to Saint Louis--which was nearly eight\r\nhundred miles distant.\r\n\r\n\"After proceeding a mile or two--creeping through bushes, and skulking\r\nbehind rocks--I saw the trail of the Indians striking out into an open\r\nplain, in a due westerly direction.  They must have formed a large band,\r\nand all mounted, as the tracks of their horses testified.  Seeing that\r\nthey had moved off westward, I formed the resolution of making two or\r\nthree days' journey to the south, and afterwards turning in a westerly\r\ndirection.  This would most likely secure me from meeting them again,\r\nand would bring me, as I guessed, to the eastern ranges of the Rocky\r\nMountains through which I might pass into the valley of New Mexico.  I\r\nhad heard my companions speak of a more southern pass through these\r\nmountains, than that which lies near Santa Fe; and I hoped to be able to\r\nreach it, although I believed it to be two hundred miles distant.  With\r\nthese plans in my mind, I returned to where I had left my little party.\r\n\r\n\"It was night when I got back to the wagon, and I found Mary and the\r\nchildren in great distress at my delay; but I had brought them good\r\nnews--that the Indians were gone away.\r\n\r\n\"I first thought of remaining all night where we were; but, not being\r\nyet fully satisfied that the Indians were gone, I changed my intention.\r\nSeeing that we were to have a moon, and that a smooth plain stretched\r\naway towards the south, I concluded that it would be better to make a\r\nnight journey of it, and put twenty miles, if possible, between us and\r\nthe camp.  All agreed with this proposal.  In fact, we were all equally\r\nanxious to get away from that fearful spot; and had we stayed by it, not\r\none of us could have slept a wink.  The apprehension that the savages\r\nmight return, and the excited state of our feelings--to say nothing of\r\nthe terrible howling of the wolves--would have kept us awake; so,\r\nresolving to take our departure, we waited for the rising of the moon.\r\n\r\n\"We did not waste time, my friends.  You all know that water is the\r\ngreat want in these deserts, both for man and beast.  We knew not where\r\nor when we might next find it; so we took the precaution to fill our\r\nvessels at the stream.  We filled all we had that would hold water.\r\nAlas! these were not enough, as you shall hear.\r\n\r\n\"The moon rose at length.  She seemed to smile upon the horrid picture\r\nthat lay below at the deserted camp; but we stayed no longer to\r\ncontemplate it.  Leading our oxen out of their _cache_, we struck out\r\ninto the open plain, in a direction as nearly south as I could guide\r\nmyself.  I looked northward for the star in the tail of the Little\r\nBear--the polar star--which I soon found by the pointers of the Ursa\r\nMajor; and keeping this directly on our backs, we proceeded on.\r\nWhenever the inequalities of the ground forced us out of our track, I\r\nwould again turn to this little star, and consult its unfailing index.\r\nThere it twinkled in the blue heavens like the eye of a friend.  It was\r\nthe finger of God pointing us onward.\r\n\r\n\"And onward we went--here creeping around some gaping fissure, that\r\nopened across our track--there wading over a sandy swell--and anon\r\nrolling briskly along the smooth, herbless plain; for the country we\r\nwere passing through was a parched and treeless desert.\r\n\r\n\"We made a good night's journey of it, cheered by the prospect of\r\nescaping from the savages.  When day broke, we were twenty miles from\r\nthe camp.  The rough hills that surrounded it were completely lost to\r\nour view, and we knew from this that we had travelled a long way; for\r\nsome of these hills were of great height.  We knew that we must have\r\npassed over a considerable arc of the earth's surface before their tops\r\ncould have sunk below the horizon.  Of course, some intervening ridges,\r\nsuch as the sandy swells I have mentioned, helped to hide them from our\r\nview; but, at all events, we had the satisfaction of knowing that the\r\nsavages, even had they returned to the camp, could not now see us from\r\nthat point.  We only feared the chances of their discovering our tracks,\r\nand following us.  Urged by this apprehension, we did not halt when the\r\nday broke, but kept on until near noontide.  Then we drew up--for our\r\noxen, as well as the horse, were completely tired out, and could go no\r\nfarther without rest.\r\n\r\n\"It was but a poor rest for them--with neither grass nor water--not a\r\nblade of anything green except the _artemisia_ plant, the wild\r\nwormwood--which, of course, neither horse nor oxen would touch.  This\r\ngrew all around us in low thickets.  Its gnarled and twisted bushes,\r\nwith their white silvery leaves, so far from gladdening the eye, only\r\nserved to render the scene more dreary and desolate--for we knew that\r\nthis plant denoted the extreme barrenness of the soil.  We knew that,\r\nwherever it grew, the desert was around it.\r\n\r\n\"It was, indeed, but a poor rest for our animals--for the hot sun\r\nglanced down upon them during the noon hours, making them still more\r\nthirsty.  We could not afford them a drop of the precious water; for we\r\nourselves were oppressed with extreme thirst, and our stock was hourly\r\ndiminishing.  It was as much as we could to spare a small quantity to\r\nthe dogs, Castor and Pollux.\r\n\r\n\"Long before night, we once more yoked to the oxen, and continued our\r\njourney, in the hope of reaching some stream or spring.  By sunset we\r\nhad made ten miles farther to the south, but no landmark as yet appeared\r\nin sight--nothing to indicate the presence of water.  We could see\r\nnothing around us but the sterile plain stretching on all sides to the\r\nhorizon--not even a bush, or rock, or the form of a wild animal,\r\nrelieved the monotonous expanse.  We were as much alone, as if we had\r\nbeen in an open boat in the middle of the ocean!\r\n\r\n\"We began to grow alarmed, and to hesitate.  Should we go back?  No,\r\nthat would never do.  Even had the prospect at the end of a backward\r\njourney been more cheering, we felt uncertain whether we might be able\r\nto reach the stream we had just left.  We should surely reach water as\r\nsoon by keeping forward; and with this thought we travelled on through\r\nall the livelong night.\r\n\r\n\"When morning came, I again surveyed the horizon, but could see no\r\nobject along its level line.  I was riding gloomily alongside the poor\r\noxen, watching their laborious efforts, when a voice sounded in my ears.\r\nIt was that of Frank, who was standing in the fore part of the wagon,\r\nlooking out from under the tilt.\r\n\r\n\"`Papa! papa!' cried he, `look at the pretty white cloud!'\r\n\r\n\"I looked up at the boy, to see what he meant.  I saw that he was\r\npointing to the south-east, and I turned my eyes in that direction.  I\r\nuttered an exclamation of joy, which startled my companions; for I saw\r\nthat what Frank had taken for a white cloud was the snowy cap of a\r\nmountain!  I might have seen it before, had my eyes been searching in\r\nthat quarter; but they were not, as I was examining the sky more towards\r\nthe south and west.\r\n\r\n\"Guided by no very extraordinary experience, I knew that where there was\r\nsnow there must be water; and, without another word, I directed Cudjo to\r\nhead his oxen for the mountain.  It was out of the way we wanted to go;\r\nbut we thought not of that, for the saving of our lives had now come to\r\nbe the only question with us.\r\n\r\n\"The mountain was still twenty miles distant.  We could have seen it\r\nmuch farther off, but we had been travelling through the night.  The\r\nquestion was, would our oxen be able to reach it?  They were already\r\ntottering in their tracks.  If they should break down, could we reach\r\nit?  Our water was all gone, and we were suffering from thirst as the\r\nsun rose.  A river, thought I, must run from the mountain, fed by the\r\nmelting of its snows.  Perhaps we might come to this river before\r\narriving at the mountain-foot.  But, no;--the plain evidently sloped\r\ndown from us to the mountain.  Whatever stream ran from it must go the\r\nother way.  We should find no water before reaching the mountain--\r\nperhaps, not then; and, tortured with these doubts, we pushed gloomily\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\"By noon the oxen began to give out.  One of them fell dead, and we left\r\nhim.  The other three could not go much farther.  Every article that was\r\nof no present use was thrown from the wagon to lighten it, and left\r\nlying on the plain; but still the poor brutes were scarce able to drag\r\nit along.  We went at a snail's pace.\r\n\r\n\"A short rest might recruit the animals, but I could not bring myself to\r\nhalt again, as my heart was agonised by the cries of my suffering\r\nchildren.  Mary bore up nobly; so, too, did the boys.  For myself, I\r\ncould not offer a word of consolation, for I knew that we were still ten\r\nmiles from the foot of the mountain.  I thought of the possibility of\r\nriding on ahead, and bringing back some water in the vessels; but I saw\r\nthat my horse could never stand it.  He was even now unable to carry me,\r\nand I was afoot, leading him.  Cudjo also walked by the side of the\r\noxen.  Another of these now gave up, and only two remained to drag the\r\nvehicle.\r\n\r\n\"At this terrible moment several objects appeared before us on the\r\nplain, that caused me to cry out with delight.  They were dark-green\r\nmasses, of different sizes--the largest of them about the size of a bee\r\ncap.  They looked like a number of huge hedge hogs rolled up, and\r\npresenting on all sides their thorny spikes.  On seeing them, I dropped\r\nmy horse; and, drawing my knife, ran eagerly forward.  My companions\r\nthought I had gone mad, not understanding why I should have drawn my\r\nknife on such harmless-looking objects, and not knowing what they were.\r\nBut I knew well what they were: I knew they were the _globe cacti_.\r\n\r\n\"In a moment's time I had peeled the spikelets from several of them; and\r\nas the wondering party came up, and saw the dark-green succulent\r\nvegetables, with the crystal water oozing out of their pores, they were\r\nsatisfied that I had not gone mad.\r\n\r\n\"In a short while, we had cut the huge spheroids into slices, which we\r\nchewed with avidity.  We set some of them also before the horse and\r\noxen, both of which devoured them greedily, sap, fibres, and all; while\r\nthe dogs lapped the cool liquid wherever they were cut.\r\n\r\n\"It is true, that this did not quench thirst, in the same way that a\r\ndrink of water would have done; but it greatly relieved us, and would,\r\nperhaps, enable us to reach the mountain.  We resolved to halt for a\r\nshort while, in order to rest the oxen.  Unfortunately, the relief had\r\ncome too late for one of them.  It had been his last stretch; and when\r\nwe were about to start again, we found that he had lain down and was\r\nunable to rise.  We saw that we must leave him; and, taking such harness\r\nas we could find, we put the horse in his place, and moved onward.  We\r\nwere in hopes of finding another little garden of cactus plants; but\r\nnone appeared, and we toiled on, suffering as before.\r\n\r\n\"When we had got within about five miles of the mountain-foot, the other\r\nox broke down, and fell--as we supposed--dead.  We could take the wagon\r\nno farther; but it was no time either to hesitate or halt: we must try\r\nit afoot, or perish where we were.\r\n\r\n\"I loosed out the horse, and left him to his will--I saw he was no\r\nlonger able to carry any of us.  I took an axe from the wagon--also a\r\ntin-pot, and a piece of dry beef that still remained to us.  Cudjo\r\nshouldered the axe and little Mary; I carried the beef, the pot, Luisa,\r\nand my rifle; while my wife, Frank, and Harry, each held something in\r\ntheir hands.  Thus burdened, we bade adieu to the wagon, and struck off\r\ntoward the mountain.  The dogs followed; and the poor horse, not willing\r\nto be left behind, came tottering after.\r\n\r\n\"There is not much more of that journey to be detailed.  We toiled\r\nthrough the five miles the best way we could.  As we drew nearer to the\r\nmountain, we could see deep dark ravines running down its sides, and in\r\nthe bottom of one we distinguished a silvery thread, which we knew was\r\nthe foam of water as it dashed over the rocks.  The sight gave us new\r\nenergy, and in another hour we had reached the banks of a crystal\r\nstream, and were offering thanks for our deliverance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nADVENTURE WITH AN ARMADILLO.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my friends, we had arrived on the banks of a rivulet, and were\r\nthanking God for bringing us safely there.  We soon satisfied our\r\nthirst, as you may believe, and began to look around us.  The stream we\r\nhad reached was not that which runs into the valley here, but altogether\r\non the other side of the mountain.  It was but a mere rill, and I saw\r\nthat several similar ones issued from the ravines, and after running a\r\nshort distance into the plain, fell off toward the south-east, and\r\nunited with others running from that side.  I found afterwards that they\r\nall joined into the same channel, forming a considerable river, which\r\nruns from this elevated plain in an easterly direction; and which I take\r\nto be a head-water of the Great Red River of Louisiana, or perhaps of\r\nthe Brazos, or Colorado, of Texas.  I have called it a considerable\r\nriver.  That is not quite correct; for although, where they all unite,\r\nthey form a good-sized body of water, yet twenty miles farther down, for\r\nthree-fourths of the year the channel is perfectly dry; and that is the\r\ncase I know not how far beyond.  The water, which passes from the\r\nmountain at all times, is either evaporated by the hot sun, or sinks\r\ninto the sands of its own bed, during a run of twenty miles.  It is only\r\nin times of great rain--a rare occurrence here--or when very hot weather\r\nmelts an unusual quantity of the snow, that there is water enough to\r\ncarry the stream over a flat sandy tract which stretches away to the\r\neastward.  All these things I found out afterwards, and as you, my\r\nfriends, know them to be common phenomena of the Desert, I shall not now\r\ndwell upon them.\r\n\r\n\"I saw that, where we were, there was but little chance of getting\r\nanything to eat.  The sides of the mountain were rugged and grim, with\r\nhere and there a stunted cedar hanging from the rocks.  The small\r\npatches of grass and willows that lined the banks of the little rills--\r\nalthough cheering to the eye, when compared with the brown barrenness of\r\nthe Desert--offered but little prospect that we should get any thing to\r\neat there.  If the Desert stretched away to the south of the mountain,\r\nas we saw that it did to the north, east, and west, then we had only\r\nreached a temporary resting-place, and we might still perish, if not\r\nfrom thirst, from what was equally bad--hunger.\r\n\r\n\"This was uppermost in our thoughts at the time,--for we had not eaten a\r\nmorsel during that day; so we turned our attention to the piece of dried\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\n\"`Let us cook it, and make a soup,' said Mary; `that will be better for\r\nthe children.'  My poor wife!  I saw that the extreme fatigue she had\r\nundergone had exhausted her strength, yet still she endeavoured to be\r\ncheerful.\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, papa, let us make soup; soup is very nice,' added Frank, trying\r\nto cheer his mother by showing that he was not dismayed.\r\n\r\n\"`Very well, then,' I replied.  `Come, Cudjo, shoulder your axe, and let\r\nus to the mountain for wood.  Yonder are some pine-trees near the\r\nfoot,--they will make an excellent fire.'\r\n\r\n\"So Cudjo and I started for the wood, which was growing about three\r\nhundred yards distant, and close in to the rocks where the stream came\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\"As we drew nearer to the trees, I saw that they were not pine-trees,\r\nbut very different indeed.  Both trunks and branches had long thorny\r\nspikes upon them like porcupine's quills, and the leaves were of a\r\nbright shining green, pinnate with small oval leaflets.  But what was\r\nmost singular was the long bean-shaped pods that hung down thickly from\r\nthe branches.  These were about an inch and a half in breadth, and some\r\nof them not less than twelve inches in length.  They were of a\r\nreddish-brown, nearly a claret colour.  Except in the colour, they\r\nlooked exactly like large bean-pods filled with beans.\r\n\r\n\"I was not ignorant of what species of tree was before us.  I had seen\r\nit before.  I knew it was the honey-locust, or thorny acacia,--the\r\ncarob-tree of the East, and the famed `algarobo' of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n\"I was not ignorant of its uses neither,--for I knew this to be the tree\r\nupon which (as many suppose) Saint John the Baptist sustained himself in\r\nthe Desert, where it is said, `his meat was locusts and wild honey.'\r\nHence it is sometimes called, `Saint John's bread.'  Neither was Cudjo\r\nignorant of its value.  The moment his eyes rested upon the long brown\r\nlegumes, he cried out, with gestures of delight:--\r\n\r\n\"`Massa--Massa Roff, lookee yonder!--beans and honey for supper!'\r\n\r\n\"We were soon under the branches: and while I proceeded to knock down\r\nand collect a quantity of the ripe fruit.  Cudjo went farther up among\r\nthe rocks, to procure his firewood from the pines that grew there.\r\n\r\n\"I soon filled my handkerchief, and was waiting for Cudjo, when I heard\r\nhim shout,--\r\n\r\n\"`Massa Roff! come dis away, and see de varmint--what him be.'\r\n\r\n\"I immediately ran up among the rocks.  On reaching the spot where Cudjo\r\nwas, I found him bending over a crevice or hole in the ground, from\r\nwhich protruded an object very much like the tail of a pig.\r\n\r\n\"`What is it, Cudjo?'  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"`Don't know, Massa.  Varmint I never see in Vaginny--looks someting\r\nlike de ole 'possum.'\r\n\r\n\"`Catch hold of the tail, and pull him out,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"`Lor!  Massa Roff, I've tried ma best, but can't fetch 'im no how.\r\nLook yar!'  And so saying, my companion seized the tail, and pulled--\r\nseemingly with all his might--but to no purpose.\r\n\r\n\"`Did you see the animal when it was outside?'  I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, Massa; see 'im and chase 'im 'till I tree him yar in dis cave.'\r\n\r\n\"`What was it like?'\r\n\r\n\"`Berry like a pig--maybe more belike ole 'possum, but cubberd all ober\r\nwi' shell like a Vaginny turtle.'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh! then--it is an armadillo.'\r\n\r\n\"`An amadiller!  Cudjo niver hear o' dat varmint afore.'\r\n\r\n\"I saw that the animal which had so astonished my companion was one of\r\nthose curious living things--which Nature, in giving variety to her\r\ncreatures, has thought proper to form--and which are known throughout\r\nMexico and South America by the name of `armadilloes.'  They are so\r\ncalled from the Spanish word `armado,' which signifies armed--because\r\nall over their body there is a hard, shell-like covering divided into\r\nbands and regular figures, exactly like the coats-of-mail worn by the\r\nwarriors of ancient times.  There is even a helmet covering the head,\r\nconnected with the other parts of the armour by a joint, which renders\r\nthis resemblance still more complete and singular.  There are many\r\nspecies of these animals; some of them as large as a full-sized sheep,\r\nbut the generality of them are much smaller.  The curious figuring of\r\nthe shell that covers them differs in the different species.  In some\r\nthe segments are squares, in others hexagons, and in others, again, they\r\nare of a pentagonal shape.  In all of them, however, the figures have a\r\nmathematical form and precision, that is both strange and beautiful.\r\nThey look as though they were artificial,--that is, carved by the hand\r\nof man.  They are harmless creatures, and most of the species feed upon\r\nherbs and grass.  They do not run very nimbly, though they can go much\r\nfaster than one would suppose, considering the heavy armour which they\r\ncarry.  This, however, is not all in one shell, but in many pieces\r\nconnected together by a tough, pliable skin.  Hence they can use their\r\nlimbs with sufficient ease.  They are not such slow travellers as the\r\nturtles and tortoises.  When they are pursued and overtaken, they\r\nsometimes gather themselves into a round ball, as hedgehogs do; and if\r\nthey should happen to be near the edge of a precipice they will roll\r\nthemselves over to escape from their enemy.  More often when pursued\r\nthey betake themselves to their holes, or to any crevice among rocks\r\nthat may be near; and this was evidently the case with that which Cudjo\r\nhad surprised.  When they can hide their heads, like the ostrich they\r\nfancy themselves safe; and so, no doubt, thought this one, until he felt\r\nthe sinewy fingers of Cudjo grasping him by the tail.  It was evident\r\nthe animal had run into a shallow crack where he could get no farther,\r\nelse we would soon have lost sight of his tail; but it was equally\r\nevident, that pulling by that appendage was not the method to get him\r\nout.  I could see that he had pushed the scaly armour outward and\r\nupward, so that it held fast against the rocks on every side.  Moreover,\r\nhis claws, which are remarkable both for length and tenacity, were\r\nclutched firmly against the bottom of the crevice.  It would have taken\r\na team of oxen to have pulled him out, as Cudjo remarked with a grin.\r\n\r\n\"I had heard of a plan used by the Indians who hunt the armadillo, and\r\nare very fond of his flesh; and as I was determined to try it, I told my\r\ncompanion to let go the tail, and stand to one side.\r\n\r\n\"I now knelt down in front of the cave, and, taking a small branch of\r\ncedar, commenced tickling the hind-quarters of the animal with the sharp\r\nneedles.  In a moment I saw that his muscles began to relax, as the\r\nshell to separate from the rocks, and close in toward his body.  After\r\ncontinuing the operation for some minutes, I observed that he had\r\nreduced himself to his natural size, and had no doubt forgotten to keep\r\na look-out with his claws.  Seeing this, I seized the tail firmly; and,\r\ngiving it a sudden jerk, swung the armadillo out between the feet of my\r\ncompanion.  Cudjo aimed a blow with the axe which nearly severed its\r\nhead from its body, and killed the animal outright.  It was about the\r\nsize of a rabbit, and proved to be of the eight-banded species--reckoned\r\nmore delicious eating than any other.\r\n\r\n\"We now returned to camp with our firewood, our locust-beans, and our\r\narmadillo--the last of which horrified my wife, when I told her I was\r\ngoing to eat it.  It proved a great curiosity to the boys, however, who\r\namused themselves by running their fingers all over its mottled armour.\r\nBut I had something that amused the little Mary and Luisa still more--\r\nthe delicious, honey-like pulp from the pods of the locust-tree, which\r\nthey greedily ate.  The seeds we extracted from the pulp, intending to\r\nroast them as soon as we had kindled our fire.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my friends,\" continued Rolfe, rising to his feet, \"since we\r\nhave got to talking about this same locust-tree, I hope you will not\r\nrefuse to try a mug of my home-brewed beer, which I made out of its\r\nbeans this very day, while you were wandering about my grounds and\r\nthrough the valley.  It is, perhaps, not equal to Barclay and Perkins';\r\nbut I flatter myself that, under the circumstances, you will not find it\r\nunpalatable.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, our host brought forward a large flagon, and pouring into\r\nour cups a brown-coloured liquid, set them before us.  We all drank of\r\nthe \"locust beer,\" which was not unlike mead or new cider; and to prove\r\nthat we liked it, we drank again and again.\r\n\r\nThis ceremony over Rolfe once more resumed his narrative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nA VERY LEAN BUFFALO.\r\n\r\n\"We were all soon engaged in different occupations.  Mary was preparing\r\nthe dried meat, which she intended to boil along with the locust-beans\r\nin our tin-pot.  Fortunately, it was a large one, and held nearly a\r\ngallon.  Cudjo was busy kindling the fire, which already sent up its\r\nvolumes of blue smoke.  Frank, Harry, and the little ones, were sucking\r\naway at the natural preserves of the acacia, while I was dressing my\r\narmadillo for the spit.  In addition to this, our horse was filling out\r\nhis sides upon the rich buffalo-grass that grew along the stream; and\r\nthe dogs--poor fellows! they were like to fare worst of all--stood\r\nwatching my operations, and snapped eagerly at every scrap that fell\r\nfrom my knife.  In a very short while the fire was blazing up, the beef\r\nand beans were bubbling over it in the tin-pot, and the armadillo was\r\nsputtering on the spit beside them.  In another short while all things\r\nwere cooked and ready to be eaten.\r\n\r\n\"We now remembered that we had neither plates, glasses, knives, forks,\r\nnor spoons--yes, Cudjo and I had our hunting-knives; and, as it was no\r\ntime to be nice, with these we fished the pieces of meat and some of the\r\nbeans out of the soup-pot, and placed them upon a clean, flat stone.\r\nFor the soup itself, we immersed the lower part of the pot into the cool\r\nwater of the stream, so that in a short time Mary and the children could\r\napply the edge of it to their lips, and drink of it in turn.\r\n\r\n\"As for Cudjo and myself, we did not want any of the soup.  We were\r\naltogether for the `substantials.'\r\n\r\n\"I thought, at first, I should have all the armadillo to myself.  Even\r\nCudjo, who in `ole Vaginny' had bolted 'coons, 'possums, and various\r\nother `varmints,' for a long time hung back.  Seeing, however, that I\r\nwas eating with evident relish, he held out his sable paw, and desired\r\nme to help him to a small piece.  Having once tasted it, the ice of his\r\nappetite seemed to be all at once broken, and he kept asking for more,\r\nand then for more, until I began to fear he would not leave me enough\r\nfor my own support.\r\n\r\n\"Neither Mary nor the boys, however, would consent to share with us,\r\nalthough I assured them, what was positively the fact, that what I was\r\neating was equal in delicacy of flavour to the finest roast pig--a dish,\r\nby the way, to which the armadillo bears a very great resemblance.\r\n\r\n\"The sun was now setting, and we began to think how we were to pass the\r\nnight.  We had left all our blankets in the wagon, and the air was fast\r\nbecoming cold, which is always the case in the neighbourhood of snowy\r\nmountains.  This is easily explained.  The atmosphere getting cool upon\r\nthe peak, where it envelopes the snow, of course becomes heavier, and\r\nkeeps constantly descending around the base of the mountain, and pushing\r\nup and out that air which is warmer and lighter.  In fact, there was a\r\nsensible breeze blowing down the sides of the mountain--caused by these\r\nnatural laws--and it had already made us chilly, after the burning heat\r\nthrough which we had been travelling.  Should we sleep in this cold\r\natmosphere--even though we should keep up a fire during the whole\r\nnight--I knew that we must suffer much.\r\n\r\n\"The thought now entered my mind, that I might go back to the wagon--\r\nwhich was only five miles off--and bring up our blankets.  Should I go\r\nmyself, or send Cudjo, or should both of us go?  All at once the idea\r\ncame into my head that one of us might ride there, and bring back a load\r\nof other articles, as well as the blankets.  Our horse, who had been\r\nfilling himself for the last hour and a half with good grass and water,\r\nalready began to show symptoms of life and vigour.  Animals of this kind\r\nsoon recover from fatigue, when their food and drink are restored to\r\nthem.  I saw that he would be quite able to do the journey, so I gave\r\nCudjo directions to catch him.  There happened to be a piece of rope\r\naround his neck, and this would serve for a bridle.  I hesitated for\r\nsome time, whether both Cudjo and I should leave Mary and the children;\r\nbut my wife urged us to go, telling us she would have no fear, as long\r\nas Harry and Frank with their rifles remained with her.  The dogs, too,\r\nwould stay.  Indeed, there was not much danger of their leaving her,\r\nwhile she held in her arms the little Luisa, whom both these animals\r\nseemed to watch over.\r\n\r\n\"Influenced by her advice, I consented to leave her alone with the\r\nchildren; and, giving directions that they should fire off one of the\r\nrifles, in case of any alarm, I set forth, with Cudjo and the horse.\r\n\r\n\"We could see the white tilt of the wagon from the very start; and we\r\nhad no difficulty in guiding ourselves to it.\r\n\r\n\"As we passed onward, I was reflecting whether the wolves had not\r\nalready made a meal of our poor ox that we had left by the wagon.  If\r\nnot, it was my intention to skin him, and save the meat, lean and tough\r\nas it must be--for the animal, when we left him, looked like some dry\r\nskeleton to be preserved in a museum.  Still I saw before us no prospect\r\nof a better breakfast, and I began to grow very anxious as to whether we\r\nmight find a bit of him left.  At this moment, I was startled from my\r\nreflections by an exclamation from Cudjo, who had stopped suddenly, and\r\nwas pointing to some object directly ahead of us.  I looked forward; and\r\nsaw in the dim light something that very much resembled a large\r\nquadruped.\r\n\r\n\"`P'raps, Massa,' whispered Cudjo, `him be de buffler.'\r\n\r\n\"`Perhaps it is a buffalo; but what is to be done?  I have left my\r\nrifle.  Here! take the horse, and I will endeavour to get near enough to\r\nkill it with my pistols.'\r\n\r\n\"Giving Cudjo the horse, and cautioning him to be silent, I drew the\r\nlargest of my pistols, and crept silently forward.  I went upon my hands\r\nand knees, and very slowly, so as not to give the animal an alarm.  As I\r\ngot nearer, I felt sure it was a buffalo; but the moon had not yet\r\nrisen, and I could see its form but very indistinctly.  At length, I\r\nbelieved I had it within range of my pistol; at least, thought I, if I\r\ngo any nearer it will make off; so I halted--still upon my knees--and\r\nmade ready to fire.  As I raised my weapon, the horse suddenly neighed;\r\nand, in answer to his neigh, the strange animal uttered a loud roar,\r\nwhich I knew to be nothing else than the bellowing of an ox!  And so it\r\nproved, as it was neither more nor less than our own ox, who had left\r\nthe wagon, and was slowly making his way for the mountain.  The cool air\r\nhad somewhat revived him, and instinct, or a knowledge of the way we had\r\ngone, was guiding him in that direction.\r\n\r\n\"I know not whether I was more pleased or disappointed at meeting our\r\nold companion.  A good fat buffalo would have been more welcome at the\r\ntime than a famished ox; but when I reflected that he might yet help us\r\nto get out of the Desert, I felt that we were fortunate in finding him\r\nstill alive.  The horse and he put their noses together, evidently\r\npleased at again meeting each other; and I could not help thinking, as\r\nthe ox shook his long tail, that the horse must have whispered to him\r\nabout the nice grass and water that were so near.  The ox had his reins\r\nupon him; and lest he might stray from the track, we tied him to a\r\nsage-bush, so that we might take him with us on our way back.\r\n\r\n\"We were about leaving him, when it occurred to me, that if the ox only\r\nhad a little water, he might, along with the horse, enable us to bring\r\nthe wagon up to the mountain.  What a delightful surprise it would be to\r\nMary, to see us return with ox, wagon, and all;--not only the blankets,\r\nbut also our cups, pans, and cooking-pots, besides some coffee, and\r\nother little luxuries, that were stored away in our great chest!  Ha!\r\nthought I, that would be delightful; and I immediately communicated the\r\nidea to Cudjo.  My companion fully agreed with me, and believed it quite\r\npossible and practicable.  We had brought along with us the tin-pot fall\r\nof cool water from the stream; but it was too narrow at the mouth, and\r\nthe ox could not possibly drink out of it.\r\n\r\n\"`Let us gib it, Massa Roff,' advised Cudjo, `in de ole hoss-bucket,\r\nonce we gets 'im back to de wagon.  Ya! ya! we gib Missa an\r\nabstonishment.'  And my light-hearted companion laughed with delight, at\r\nthe prospect of making his mistress happy on our return.\r\n\r\n\"Without farther parley, we unloosed the rein from the sage-bush, and\r\nled the ox back towards the wagon.  Neither of us rode the horse, as we\r\nknew he would have enough to do in dragging up his share of the load.\r\n\r\n\"On reaching the wagon, we found everything as we had left it; but\r\nseveral large white wolves were prowling around; and, no doubt, it had\r\nbeen the sight of them that had roused the ox, and imparted to him the\r\nenergy that had enabled him to get away from the spot.\r\n\r\n\"We soon found the bucket; and, pouring the water into it, set it before\r\nthe ox, who drank every drop of it, and then licked the sides and\r\nbottom, of the vessel until they were quite dry.  We now `hitched to'\r\nboth the animals; and, without more ado, drove off towards our little\r\ncamp at the mountain.\r\n\r\n\"We guided ourselves by the fire, which we could see burning brightly\r\nunder the dark shadow of the cliffs.  Its blaze had a cheering effect on\r\nthe spirits both of my companion and myself; and even the horse and ox\r\nseemed to understand that it would be the end of their journey, and\r\npressed forward with alacrity to reach it.\r\n\r\n\"When within about half a mile, I heard the report of a rifle ringing\r\namong the rocks.  I was filled with alarm.  Were Mary and the children\r\nattacked by Indians?--perhaps by some savage animal?--perhaps by the\r\ngrizzly bear?\r\n\r\n\"I did not hesitate a moment, but ran forward--leaving Cudjo with the\r\nwagon.  I drew my pistol, and held it in readiness as I advanced, all\r\nthe while listening eagerly to catch every sound that might come from\r\nthe direction of the fire.  Once or twice I stopped for short intervals\r\nto breathe and listen; but there were no noises from the camp!  What\r\ncould be the meaning of the silence?  Where were the dogs?  I knew that,\r\nhad they been attacked by a grizzly bear, or any other animal, I should\r\nhave heard their barks and worrying.  But there was not a sound.  Had\r\nthey been killed all at once by Indian arrows, so silent in their deadly\r\neffect?  O God! had my wife, and children too, fallen victims?\r\n\r\n\"Filled with painful apprehensions, I ran forward with increased energy,\r\ndetermined to rush into the midst of the enemy--whoever they might be--\r\nand sell my life as dearly as possible.\r\n\r\n\"At length, I came within full view of the fire.  What was my\r\nastonishment, as well as joy, on seeing my wife sitting by the blaze,\r\nwith little Luisa upon her knee, while Mary was playing upon the ground\r\nat her feet!  But where were Harry and Frank?  It was quite\r\nincomprehensible.  I knew that they would not have fired the rifle to\r\nalarm me unnecessarily, yet there sat Mary as though no rifle had been\r\nfired!\r\n\r\n\"`What was it, dear Mary?'  I cried, running up.  `Where are the boys?--\r\nthey discharged the rifle, did they not?'\r\n\r\n\"`They did,' she replied; `Harry fired at something.'\r\n\r\n\"`At what?--at what?'  I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"`At some animal, I know not what kind; but I think they must have\r\nwounded it, for they all ran out, dogs and all, after the shot was\r\nfired, and have not yet come back.'\r\n\r\n\"`In what direction?'  I asked hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\"Mary pointed out the direction; and, without waiting further, I ran off\r\ninto the darkness.  When about an hundred yards from the fire, I came\r\nupon Harry, Frank, and the mastiffs, standing over some animal which I\r\nsaw was quite dead.  Harry was not a little proud of the shot he had\r\nmade, and expected me to congratulate him, which of course I did; and\r\nlaying hold of the animal by one of its hind-legs--for it had no tail to\r\nlay hold of--I dragged it forward to the light of the fire.  It appeared\r\nto be about the size of a sucking calf, though much more elegantly\r\nshaped, for its legs were long and slender, and its shanks not thicker\r\nthan a common walking-cane.  It was of a pale red colour, whitish along\r\nthe breast and belly, but its large, languishing eyes and slender\r\nforking horns told me at once what sort of animal it was; it was the\r\nprong-horned antelope,--the only species of antelope found in North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\"Mary new related the adventure.  While they were sitting silently by\r\nthe fire, and somewhat impatiently awaiting our return--for the wagon\r\nhad delayed us considerably--they saw a pair of large eyes glancing in\r\nthe darkness like two candles, and not many yards from where they sat.\r\nThey could see nothing but the eyes; but this of itself was sufficient\r\nto alarm them, as they fancied it might be a wolf, or, perhaps still\r\nworse, a hear or panther.  They did not lose presence of mind, however;\r\nand they knew that to escape by running away would be impossible; so\r\nboth Frank and Harry took hold of their rifles--though Harry was\r\nforemost with his.  He then aimed, as well as he could, between the two\r\nglancing eyes, and pulled trigger.  Of course the smoke blinded them,\r\nand in the darkness they could not tell whether the bullet had hit the\r\nanimal or not; but the dogs--who up to this time had been sleeping by\r\nthe fire--sprang to their feet, and ran out in pursuit.  They could hear\r\nthem running for some distance, and then they heard a scramble and a\r\nstruggle, and then they were silent; so they concluded--what afterwards\r\nproved to be the case--that Harry had wounded the animal, and that the\r\ndogs had caught, and were worrying it.  And so they were, for as the\r\nboys got to the spot they had just killed it; and--hungry as they were--\r\nwould soon have made a meal of it had Frank and Harry not got up in good\r\ntime to prevent them.  The antelope had been shot in the shoulder, and\r\nhad only run for a short distance before it fell.\r\n\r\n\"Although Harry did not boast of his prowess, I saw that he had a\r\ntriumphant look,--the more so as this fine piece of venison would ensure\r\nus all against hunger for three days at the least; and, considering that\r\nonly an hour before we did not know where the next meal was to come\r\nfrom, it was certainly no small matter to be proud of.  I thought just\r\nthen of the surprise I had prepared for them, not only in bringing up\r\nthe wagon which contained all our utensils and comforts, but in the\r\nrecovery of our best ox.\r\n\r\n\"`Where is Cudjo?' asked my wife.  `Is he bringing the blankets?'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes,' said I, knowingly, `and a good load besides.'\r\n\r\n\"At that moment was heard the creaking of wheels, and the great tilt of\r\nwhite canvass was seen, far out, reflecting back the blaze of the fire.\r\nFrank leaped to his feet, and, clapping his hands with delight, cried\r\nout,--\r\n\r\n\"`Mamma! mamma! it is the wagon!'\r\n\r\n\"Then was heard the loud voice of Cudjo in a joyous `Wo-ha!' and the\r\nmoment after, the horse and ox stepped up to the fire as lightly as if\r\nthe pull had been a mere bagatelle; and they could have stood it an\r\nhundred miles farther without flinching.  We were not slow in relieving\r\nboth of them from their traces, and giving them a full swing at the\r\ngrass and water.\r\n\r\n\"As it was now late in the night, and we were all very tired, from the\r\nfatigues we had undergone, we determined to lose no time in going to\r\nrest.  Mary went to prepare a bed in the wagon,--for this was our only\r\ntent, and a very excellent tent it was, too.  At the same time, Cudjo\r\nand I set about skinning the antelope, so that we might have it in fine\r\norder for our breakfast in the morning.  The dogs, too, were interested\r\nin this operation,--for they, poor brutes, up to this time, had fared\r\nworse than any of us.  However, the head, feet, and intestines, fell to\r\ntheir share; and they soon had a supper to their hearts' content.\r\nHaving finished skinning the antelope, we tied a rope to its legs, and\r\nslung it up to the branch of a tree--high enough to be out of the reach\r\nof wolves, as well as our own dogs, during the night.\r\n\r\n\"Mary had by this time completed the arrangements for our sleeping; and\r\nbut one thing more remained to be done before retiring to rest.  That\r\nwas a duty which we never neglected when circumstances admitted of its\r\nbeing performed.  Mary knew this, and had brought out of the wagon the\r\nonly book which it contained--the Bible.  Cudjo turned up the pine logs\r\nupon the fire; and, seating ourselves around the blaze, I read from the\r\nSacred Book those passages which were most appropriate to our own\r\nsituation,--how God had preserved Moses and the children of Israel in\r\nthe Desert Wilderness.\r\n\r\n\"Then, with clasped hands and grateful hearts, we all knelt, and offered\r\nthanks for our own almost miraculous deliverance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nTHE BIGHORNS.\r\n\r\n\"Next morning we were up by the earliest break of day, and had the\r\npleasure of witnessing a beautiful phenomenon in the sunrise.  The whole\r\ncountry to the east, as far as we could see, was a level plain; and the\r\nhorizon, of course, resembled that of the ocean when calm.  As the great\r\nyellow globe of the sun appeared above it, one could have fancied that\r\nhe was rising out of the earth itself--although he was more than ninety\r\nmillions of miles distant from any part of it.  It was a beautiful sky\r\ninto which the sun was slowly climbing up.  It was of a pale blue\r\ncolour, and without the smallest cloud--for on these high table-plains\r\nin the interior of America, you may often travel for days without seeing\r\na cloud as big as a kite.  We were all in better spirits, for we had\r\nrested well, and had no longer any fear of being followed by the savages\r\nwho had massacred our companions.  They would have been fools, indeed,\r\nto have made that dreadful journey for all they could have gotten from\r\nus.  Moreover, the sight of our antelope, with its nice yellow fat,\r\ncrisped by the cold night-air, was anything but disheartening.  As Cudjo\r\nwas a dexterous butcher, I allowed him to quarter it, while I shouldered\r\nthe axe and marched off to the mountain-foot to procure more wood for\r\nthe fire.  Mary was busy among her pots, pans, and platters, scouring\r\nand washing them all in the clear stream--for the dust of the barren\r\nplains had blown into the wagon as we marched, and had formed a thick\r\ncoating over the vessels.  Fortunately we had a good stock of these\r\nutensils--consisting of a gridiron, a large camp-kettle, a couple of\r\nmess-pans, a baking-dish, a first-rate coffee-pot and mill, half-a-dozen\r\ntin-cups and plates, with an assortment of knives, forks, and spoons.\r\nAll these things we had laid in at Saint Louis, by the advice of our\r\nScotch friend, who know very well what articles were required for a\r\njourney across the Desert.\r\n\r\n\"I was not long in getting the wood, and our fire was soon replenished\r\nand blazing brightly.  Mary attended to the coffee, which she parched in\r\none of the mess-pans, and then ground in the mill.  I handled the\r\ngridiron and broiled the venison-steaks, while Cudjo collected a large\r\nsupply of locust-beans, and roasted them.  These last were to serve us\r\nfor bread, as we had neither meal nor flour.  The supply we had brought\r\nfrom Saint Louis had been exhausted several days before; and we had\r\nlived altogether upon dried beef and coffee.  Of this last article we\r\nwere very sparing, as we had not over a pound of it left, and it was our\r\nmost precious luxury.  We had no sugar whatever, nor cream, but we did\r\nnot mind the want of either, as those who travel in the wilderness find\r\ncoffee very palatable without them--perhaps quite as much so as it is,\r\nwhen mixed with the whitest of sugar and the yellowest of cream, to the\r\npampered appetites of those who live always at home.  But, after all, we\r\nshould not have to drink our coffee without sweetening, as I observed\r\nthat Frank, while extracting the beans of the locust, was also scraping\r\nthe honeyed pulp from the pods, and putting it to one side.  He had\r\nalready collected nearly a plate full.  Well done, Frank!\r\n\r\n\"The great mess-chest had been lifted out of the wagon; and the lid of\r\nthis, with a cloth spread over it, served us for a table.  For seats we\r\nhad rolled several large stones around the chest; and upon these we sat\r\ndrinking the delicious coffee, and eating the savoury steaks of venison.\r\n\r\n\"While we were thus pleasantly engaged, I observed Cudjo suddenly\r\nrolling the whites of his eyes upwards, at the same time exclaiming,--\r\n\r\n\"`Golly!  Massa--Massa--lookee yonder!'\r\n\r\n\"The rest of us turned quickly round--for we had been sitting with our\r\nbacks to the mountain--and looked in the direction indicated by Cudjo.\r\nThere were high cliffs fronting us; and along the face of these, five\r\nlarge reddish objects were moving, so fast, that I at first thought they\r\nwere birds upon the wing.  After watching them a moment, however, I saw\r\nthat they were quadrupeds; but so nimbly did they go, leaping from ledge\r\nto ledge, that it was impossible to see their limbs.  They appeared to\r\nbe animals of the deer species--somewhat larger than sheep or goats--but\r\nwe could see that, in place of antlers, each of them had a pair of huge\r\ncurving horns.  As they leaped downward, from one platform of the cliffs\r\nto another, we fancied that they whirled about in the air, as though\r\nthey were `turning somersaults,' and seemed at times to come down heads\r\nforemost!\r\n\r\n\"There was a spur of the cliff that sloped down to within less than a\r\nhundred yards of the place where we sat.  It ended in an abrupt\r\nprecipice of some sixty or seventy feet in height above the plain.  The\r\nanimals, on reaching the level of this spur, ran along it until they had\r\narrived at its end.  Seeing the precipice they suddenly stopped, as if\r\nto reconnoitre it; and we had now a full view of them, as they stood\r\noutlined against the sky, with their graceful limbs and great curved\r\nhorns almost as large as their bodies.  We thought, of course, they\r\ncould get no farther for the precipice, and I was calculating whether my\r\nrifle--which I had laid hold of--would reach them at that distance.  All\r\nat once, to our astonishment, the foremost sprang out from the cliff;\r\nand whirling through the air, lit upon his head on the hard plain\r\nbelow!\"  We could see that he came down upon his horns, and rebounding\r\nup again to the height of several feet, turned a second somersault, and\r\nthen dropped upon his legs, and stood still!  Nothing daunted the rest\r\nfollowed, one after the other in quick succession, like so many\r\nstreet-tumblers, and like them--after the feat had been performed--the\r\nanimals stood for a moment, as if waiting for applause!\r\n\r\n\"The spot where they had dropped was not more than fifty paces from our\r\ncamp; but I was so astonished at the tremendous leap, that I quite\r\nforgot the rifle I held in my hands.  The animals, too, seemed equally\r\nastonished upon discovering us--which they now did for the first time.\r\nThe yelping of the dogs, who rushed forward at the moment, brought me to\r\nmyself again, as it did also the strangers to a sense of their dangerous\r\nproximity; and, wheeling suddenly, they bounded back for the mountain.\r\nI fired after them at random; but we all supposed without effect, as the\r\nwhole five kept on to the foot of the mountain, followed by the dogs.\r\nPresently they commenced ascending, as though they had wings; but we\r\nnoticed that one of them hung in the rear, and seemed to leap upward\r\nwith difficulty.  Upon this one our eyes became fixed, as we now fancied\r\nit was wounded.  We were right in this.  The rest soon disappeared out\r\nof sight; but that which lagged behind, on leaping for a high ledge,\r\ncame short in the attempt, and rolled backward down the face of the\r\nmountain.  The next moment we saw him struggling between the mastiffs.\r\n\r\n\"Cudjo, frank, and Harry, ran together up the steep; and soon returned,\r\nbringing the animal along with them quite dead--as the dogs had put an\r\nend to him.  It was a good load for Cudjo, and proved upon closer\r\nacquaintance to be as large as a fallow-deer.  From the huge wrinkled\r\nhorns, and other marks, I knew it to be the _argali_, or wild sheep,\r\nknown among hunters by the name of the `bighorn,' and sometimes spoken\r\nof in books as the `Rocky Mountain sheep,' although in its general\r\nappearance it looked more like an immense yellow goat, or deer with a\r\npair of rams' horns stuck upon his head.  We knew, however, it was not\r\nbad to eat,--especially to people in our circumstances; and as soon as\r\nwe had finished our breakfast, Cudjo and I whetted our knives, and\r\nhaving removed the skin, hung up the carcass alongside the remainder of\r\nthe antelope.  The dogs for their pains had a breakfast to their\r\nsatisfaction; and the rest of us, seeing so much fresh meat hanging to\r\nthe tree, with a cool stream of water running beneath it, began to fancy\r\nwe were quite delivered from the Desert.\r\n\r\n\"We now sat down together to deliberate on our future proceedings.\r\nBetween the argali and the antelope, we had provision enough to last us\r\nfor a week at least; but when that was done, what likelihood was there\r\nof our procuring a further supply of either?  Not much, thought we; for\r\nalthough there might be a few more antelopes and a few more `bighorns'\r\nabout the place, there could not be many with so little appearance of\r\nanything for them to feed upon.  Moreover, we might not find it so easy\r\nto kill any more of them,--for those we had already shot seemed to have\r\nfallen in our way by chance, or--as we more properly believed at the\r\ntime and still believe--by the guiding of a Providential hand.  But we\r\nknew it was not right or wise to rely altogether on this,--that is, we\r\nknew it was our duty, while trusting in its guidance, at the same time\r\nto make every effort which lay in our own power to save ourselves.  When\r\nour present supply should be exhausted, where was the next to come from?\r\nWe could not always live upon armadilloes, and argalis, and\r\nantelopes,--even supposing they were as plenty as the rocks.  But the\r\nchances were ten to one we should get no more of them.  Our ox in a week\r\nwould have improved in condition.  He would sustain us for a time; and\r\nthen--our horse--and then--and then--the dogs--and then--we should\r\nstarve to a certainty.\r\n\r\n\"Any of these necessities was sufficiently fearful to contemplate.\r\nShould we kill our ox, we would be unable to take the wagon along, and\r\nhow could the horse carry us all out of the Desert?  If we then killed\r\nthe horse, we should be still worse off, and utterly helpless on foot.\r\nNo man can cross the Great Desert on foot--not even the hunters--and how\r\ncould we do it?  To remain where we were would be impossible.  There\r\nwere a few patches of vegetation on the different runlets that filtered\r\naway from the mountain-foot.  There were clumps of willows growing along\r\nthese, but not enough of grass to support any stock of game upon which\r\nwe could live, even were we certain of being able to capture it.  It was\r\nevident, then, to us all, that we should have to get away from that\r\nplace as speedily as possible.\r\n\r\n\"The next point to be determined was, whether the Desert extended away\r\nto the south, as we already knew that it did to the north.  To ascertain\r\nthis, I resolved to go around the mountain, leaving the rest at the camp\r\nuntil my return.\r\n\r\n\"Our horse was by this time rested, and well fed; and, having saddled\r\nhim and shouldered my rifle, I mounted and rode off.  I kept around the\r\nmountain-foot, going by the eastern side.  I crossed several rivulets\r\nresembling the one on which we had encamped; and noticed that all these\r\nturned off toward the eastward, making their way to a main stream.  In\r\nthis direction, too, I saw a few stunted trees, with here and there an\r\nappearance of greenness on the surface of the plain.  On the way I saw\r\nan antelope, and another animal resembling a deer, but differing from\r\nall the deer I had ever seen, in having a long tail like a cow.  I knew\r\nnot at the time what sort of an animal it was, as I had never met with\r\nany description of it in books of natural history.\r\n\r\n\"After riding about five miles, I got fairly round to the east side of\r\nthe mountain, and could view the country away to the south.  As far as\r\nmy sight could reach, I saw nothing but an open plain--if possible more\r\nsterile in its character than that which stretched northward.  The only\r\ndirection in which there were any signs of fertility was to the east,\r\nand that was but in patches of scanty vegetation.\r\n\r\n\"It was a cheerless prospect.  We should now certainly have a desert to\r\ncross before we could get to any inhabited country.  To strike\r\neastwardly again, for the American frontier--circumstanced as we were\r\nwithout provisions and with worn-out cattle--would be madness; as the\r\ndistance was at least eight hundred miles.  Besides, I knew there were\r\nmany hostile tribes of Indians living on that route, so that, even\r\nshould the country prove fertile, we could never hope to get through it.\r\nTo go northward or southward would be equally impossible, as there was\r\nno civilised settlement for a thousand miles in either direction.  Our\r\nonly hope, then, would be, to attempt crossing the Desert westwardly to\r\nthe Mexican settlements on the Del Norte,--a distance of nearly two\r\nhundred miles!  To do this, we should need first to rest our ill-matched\r\nteam for several days.  We should also require provisions enough for the\r\nroute, and how were these to be obtained?  Again, thought I, we must\r\ntrust to Providence, who has already so manifestly extended a helping\r\nhand to us.\r\n\r\n\"I observed that the mountain on the southern face descended with an\r\neasier slope toward the plain, than upon the north where it is bold and\r\nprecipitous.  From this I concluded that a greater quantity of snow must\r\nbe melted, and run off in that direction.  Doubtless then, thought I,\r\nthere will be a greater amount of fertility on that side; and I\r\ncontinued to ride on, until I came in sight of the grove of willows and\r\ncotton-trees, which line the stream above the valley here.  I soon\r\nreached them, and saw that there was a stream with considerable\r\npasturage near its borders--much more than where we had encamped I tied\r\nmy horse to a tree, and climbed some distance up the mountain in order\r\nto get a view of the country south and west.  I had not got to a great\r\nheight when I caught sight of the singular chasm that seemed to open up\r\nin the plain.  I was attracted with this peculiarity, and determined to\r\nexamine it.  Descending again to where I had left my horse, I mounted,\r\nand rode straight for it.  In a short time I stood upon the brink of the\r\nprecipice, and looked down into this smiling valley.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot describe my sensations at that moment.  Only they, whose eyes\r\nhave been bent for days on the sterile wilderness, can feel the full\r\neffect produced by a scene of fertility such as there presented itself.\r\nIt was late in the autumn, and the woods that lay below me--clad in all\r\nthe variegated livery of that season--looked like some richly-coloured\r\npicture.  The music of birds ascended from the groves below, wafted\r\nupward upon the perfumed and aromatic air; and the whole scene appeared\r\nmore like a fabled Elysium than a reality of Nature I could hardly\r\nsatisfy myself that I was not dreaming, or looking upon some fantastic\r\nhallucination of the _mirage_.\r\n\r\n\"I stood for many minutes in a sort of trance, gazing down into the\r\nlovely valley.  I could observe no signs of human habitation.  No smoke\r\nrose over the trees, and no noises issued forth, except the voices of\r\nNature, uttered in the songs of birds and the hum of falling waters.  It\r\nseemed as though man had never desecrated this isolated paradise by his\r\npresence and passions.\r\n\r\n\"I say I stood for many minutes gazing and listening.  I could have\r\nremained for hours; but the sinking sun admonished me to hasten away.  I\r\nwas nearly twenty miles from our camp, and my horse was neither strong\r\nnor fresh.  Determined, therefore, to return on the morrow, bringing\r\nwith me my companions and all that belonged to us, I turned my horse's\r\nhead and rode back.  It was late in the night--near midnight--when I\r\nreached camp.  I found everything as I had left it, except that Mary was\r\nin great anxiety about what had delayed me so long.  But my return, and\r\nthe discovery which I communicated, soon restored her spirits; and we\r\nlaid out our plans for changing our camp to the valley, determined to\r\nset forth at an early hour in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ELK.\r\n\r\n\"We were stirring by sunrise next morning; and having breakfasted\r\nheartily, we packed our wagon and started away from our camp, which we\r\nhad named `Camp Antelope.'  The stream we called `Bighorn Creek' ever\r\nafterwards.  We arrived at the upper end of the valley about an hour\r\nbefore sunset.  Here we passed the night.  Next day I set forth to find\r\nsome path by which we might get down into the bottom.  I rode for miles\r\nalong the edge of the bluff, but to my surprise I found that on both\r\nsides ran a steep precipice; and I began to fear that the tempting\r\nparadise was inaccessible, and had only been created to tantalise us.\r\nAt length I reached the lower end, where, as you have noticed, the\r\nprecipice is much less elevated--on account of the sloping of the upper\r\nplain.  Here I came upon a path winding gradually down, upon which I saw\r\nthe footmarks of animals of various kinds.  This was exactly what I\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n\"In this valley we could remain until our cattle were sufficiently\r\nrecruited to face the Desert, while with our rifles we should be able to\r\nprocure a sufficient stock of provisions for the journey.\r\n\r\n\"I went back for the wagon; but as I had consumed most of the day in my\r\nexplorations, it was late when I reached the camp; and we remained\r\nanother night on the same spot, which we named the `Willow Camp.'\r\n\r\n\"Next morning, we started early.  On arriving at the point where the\r\npath led down, we halted the wagon.  Mary and the children remained with\r\nit, while Cudjo and I descended into the valley to reconnoitre.  The\r\nwoods were quite thick--the trees apparently all bound together by huge\r\nvines, that stretched from one to the other like immense serpents.\r\nThere was a thick undergrowth of cane; but we saw that a trail had been\r\nmade through this by the passage of numerous animals.  There were no\r\nhuman footmarks to be seen, nor any signs that a human being had ever\r\nbeen upon the spot.\r\n\r\n\"We followed the trail that led us directly to the banks of the stream.\r\nIt was then very shallow, and a great part of its shingly bed was dry.\r\nI saw that this would afford a good road for our wagon, and we kept on\r\nup the channel.  About three miles from the lower end of the valley, we\r\ncame to a place where the forest was more open, and less choked up with\r\nunderwood.  On the right bank of the stream there was a rising ground,\r\nforming a clear space of large extent, with only a tree growing here and\r\nthere.  This ground sloped gently down to the stream, and was covered\r\nwith beautiful herbage--both grass and flowers.  It was a lovely spot;\r\nand as we came suddenly out upon it, several animals, frightened by our\r\napproach, bounded off into the thickets beyond.  We stepped for a moment\r\nto gaze upon the bright picture.  Birds of brilliant wing were\r\nfluttering among the many-coloured leaves, singing or screaming, and\r\nchasing each other from tree to tree.  There were parrots, and\r\nparoquets, and orioles, and blue-jays, and beautiful loxias, both of the\r\nscarlet and azure-coloured species.  There were butterflies, too, with\r\nbroad wings mottled all over with the most vivid tints, flapping about\r\nfrom flower to flower.  Many of these were as large as some of the\r\nbirds, and far larger than others--for we saw flocks of tiny\r\nhumming-birds, not bigger than bees, shooting about like sparkling gems,\r\nand balancing themselves over the cups of the open flowers.\r\n\r\n\"It was a beautiful scene, indeed; and Cudjo and I at once agreed that\r\nthat was the very place to pitch our camp.  At the time, we meant it\r\nonly for a _camp_--a spot where we might remain until our animals had\r\nrecruited their strength, and we had collected from the forests around\r\nprovision enough for the Desert journey.  A temporary camp, indeed!\r\nThat, gentlemen, is ten years ago, and here we are upon the same spot at\r\nthis moment!  Yes, my friends, this house stands in the middle of that\r\nvery glade I have been describing.  You will be surprised, when I tell\r\nyou, there was no lake then, nor the appearance of one.  That came\r\nafterwards, as you shall hear.\r\n\r\n\"What the lake now is was then part of the glade; and its surface, like\r\nthe rest, was covered with beautiful vegetation, with, here and there,\r\ntrees standing alone, or in small clumps, which gave it a most park-like\r\nappearance.  In fact, we could not help fancying, that there was some\r\nsplendid mansion in the background, to which it belonged--although we\r\nsaw that the thick, dark woods surrounded it on all sides.\r\n\r\n\"We did not remain longer than was necessary to examine the ground.  We\r\nknew that Mary would be anxiously looking for us, so we hastened back to\r\nour wagon.  In less than three hours from that time, the wagon, with its\r\nsnow-white tilt, stood in the centre of the glade, and the ox and horse,\r\nloosed from their labour, were eagerly browsing over the rich pasture.\r\nThe children were playing on the green sward, under the shadow of a\r\nspreading magnolia; while Mary, Cudjo, the boys, and myself, were\r\nengaged in various occupations about the ground.  The birds flew around\r\nus, chattering and screaming, to the great delight of our little ones.\r\nThey came quite close to our encampment, perching upon the nearest\r\ntrees; and wondering, no doubt, what strange creatures we were, who had\r\nthus intruded upon their hitherto untenanted domain.  I was glad to see\r\nthem thus curious about us, as I argued from this that the sight of man\r\nwas new to them, and, therefore, we should be in no danger of meeting\r\nwith any of our own kind in the valley.  It is strange, that, of all\r\nothers, man was the animal we most dreaded to meet!  Yet, such was the\r\ncase; for we knew that any human beings we might fall in with in such a\r\nplace would be Indians, and, in all probability, would prove our most\r\ncruel enemies.\r\n\r\n\"It was still early in the afternoon, and we determined to do nothing\r\nfor the remainder of that day but rest ourselves, as we had all\r\nexperienced considerable fatigue in getting far wagon up the stream.\r\nRocks had to be removed, and occasionally a way hewed through the thick\r\nbranches.  But the difficulty being now over, we felt as though we had\r\nreached a home, and we set about enjoying it Cudjo built a fire, and\r\nerected a crane over it, upon which to hang our pots and kettles.  The\r\ncrane consisted of two forked sticks driven in to the ground, one on\r\neach side of the fire, with a long pole placed horizontally, and resting\r\nupon the forks.  This is the usual manner of making the crane among\r\nbackwoods' travellers, who cook their meals in the open air.  The tripod\r\ncrane, used by gipsies in Europe, is rarely to be seen among the\r\nwanderers of the American wilderness.\r\n\r\n\"In a short time, our camp-kettle, filled with pure water, was boiling\r\nand bubbling to receive the aromatic coffee; and the remainder of the\r\nantelope, suspended over the fire, was roasting and sputtering in the\r\nblaze.  Mary had set out the great chest, covered with a clean white\r\ncloth--for she had washed it the day before; and upon this our tin\r\nplates and cups--scoured until they were shining like silver--were\r\nregularly arranged.  When all these little preparations had been made,\r\nwe seated ourselves around the fire, and watched the dainty venison as\r\nit became browned and crisped in the blaze.  Cudjo had suspended the\r\njoint by a piece of strong cord, so that, by simply whirling it around,\r\nit would then continue for some time turning itself, as well as if it\r\nhad been upon a patent jack-spit.  We were congratulating ourselves on\r\nthe fine supper we were likely soon to partake of, when, all at once,\r\nour attention was directed to a noise that came out of the woods, near\r\nthe border of the open ground.  There was a rustling of leaves, with a\r\ncracking sound as of dead sticks, broken by the hoofs of some heavy\r\nanimal.  All our eyes were immediately turned in that direction.\r\nPresently we saw the leaves in motion; and the next moment three large\r\nanimals stepped out into the glade, apparently with the intention of\r\ncrossing it.\r\n\r\n\"At first sight we thought they were deer--for each of them carried a\r\npair of branching antlers--but their great size at once distinguished\r\nthem from any of the deer species we had ever seen.  Any one of them was\r\nas large as a Flemish horse; and their huge antlers rising several feet\r\nabove their heads, gave them the appearance of being still much larger.\r\nOn seeing the branched and towering horns, we took them for deer,--and\r\nin fact they were so; but far differing from either the red or\r\nfallow-deer that are to be met with in parks and forests.  They were\r\nelk--the great elk of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n\"On coming out of the timber, they marched forward, one after the other,\r\nwith a proud step, that showed the confidence they placed in their great\r\nsize and strength--as well as in the pointed weapons which they carried\r\nupon their heads, and which they can use upon an enemy with terrible\r\neffect.  Their appearance was extremely majestic; and we all admired\r\nthem in silence as they approached, for they came directly towards our\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\n\"At length they caught sight of our wagon and fire,--neither of which\r\nobjects, up to this time, they had seen.  All at once they halted,\r\ntossed up their heads, snorted, and then continued for some moments to\r\ngaze at us with an expression of wonder.\r\n\r\n\"`They will be off now,' I muttered in an undertone to my wife and\r\nCudjo.  `No doubt they will be off in a moment, and they are entirely\r\nout of reach of my rifle.'\r\n\r\n\"I had caught hold of the gun on first seeing them, and held it in\r\nreadiness across my knees Harry and Frank had also seized their small\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n\"`What pity, Massa Roff,' said Cudjo, `de big rifle no reach 'em!\r\nGolly! de be ebery one fat as 'possum!'\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking whether I might not creep a little closer to them, when,\r\nto our surprise, the animals, instead of starting off into the woods\r\nagain, came several paces nearer, and again halted, tossing up their\r\nheads with a snort similar to that which they had uttered before.  I say\r\nthat this astonished all of us, for we had heard that the elk was an\r\nexceedingly shy animal.  So, too, they are, of any danger to which they\r\nare accustomed; but, like most of the deer and antelope tribe, their\r\ncuriosity is greater than their fear; and they will approach any object\r\nwhich may be new to them, and examine it minutely, before running off.\r\nI saw that curiosity had brought them so much closer to us; and,\r\nthinking they might advance still nearer, I cautioned my companions to\r\nremain silent, and without making any stir.\r\n\r\n\"The wagon, with its great white tilt, appeared to be the main\r\nattraction to our strange visitors; and, after eyeing it a moment with\r\nlooks of wonder, they again moved several paces forward, and stopped as\r\nbefore.  A third time they advanced towards it, and again made halt.\r\n\r\n\"As the wagon was at some distance from where we were sitting by the\r\nfire, their movements towards it brought their great sides somewhat into\r\nour view.  Their last advance, moreover, had brought the leader within\r\nrange of my rifle.  He was much the largest of the three, and I\r\ndetermined to wait no longer, but let him have it; so, levelling my\r\npiece at the place which I supposed lay nearest to his heart, I pulled\r\ntrigger.\r\n\r\n\"`Missed him!' thought I, as the three great animals wheeled in their\r\ntracks, and went away like lightning.  What was strange to us, they did\r\nnot gallop, as most deer do, but went off in a sort of shambling trot,\r\nlike a `pacing' horse, and quite as fast as a horse could gallop.\r\n\r\n\"The dogs--which, up to this time, Cudjo had been holding by their\r\nnecks--dashed after with yelps and barking.  They were all--both elk and\r\ndogs--soon lost to our eyes; but for some time we could hear the elk\r\nbreaking through the thick cane and bushes, with the dogs yelling in\r\nclose pursuit.\r\n\r\n\"I thought there would be no chance of the mastiffs coming up with them,\r\nand was, therefore, not intending to follow; when, all at once, I heard\r\nthe voices of the dogs change from yelping to that of a worrying sound,\r\nas though they were engaged in a fierce conflict with one another.\r\n\r\n\"`Perhaps I have wounded the animal, and they have overtaken it,' said\r\nI.  `Come, Cudjo! let us after and see.  Boys, remain to take care of\r\nyour mother.'\r\n\r\n\"I laid hold of Harry's rifle, and followed by Cudjo, ran across the\r\nglade in the track which both elk and dogs had taken.  As we entered the\r\nbushes, I saw that their leaves were sprinkled with blood.\r\n\r\n\"`No doubt,' said I, `he is wounded, and badly, too.  We shall have him\r\nyet.'\r\n\r\n\"`Dat we shall, Massa!' cried Cudjo; and we ran on as fast as we could\r\nthrough the thick cane-brake, in the track made by the animals.  I ran\r\nahead of my companion, as Cudjo was rather slow of foot.  Every here and\r\nthere I saw gouts of blood on the leaves and cane; and, guided by the\r\nhoarse voices of the mastiffs, I soon reached the spot where they were.\r\nSure enough the wounded elk was there, down upon his knees, and\r\ndefending himself with his antlers; while one of the dogs lay sprawling\r\non the ground and howling with pain.  The other still kept up the fight,\r\nendeavouring to seize the elk from behind; but the latter spun round, as\r\nthough his knees were upon a pivot, and always presented his horny\r\nspikes in the direction of the attack.\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid the elk might get a blow at one of our brave dogs, and put\r\nan end to him, so I fired hastily; and, regardless of consequences, ran\r\nforward to finish the elk with the butt of the rifle.  I struck with all\r\nmy might, aiming directly for his head, but in my hurry I missed him;\r\nand, carried forward with the force which I had thrown into the blow, I\r\nfell right into the midst of his branching antlers!  I dropped my rifle,\r\nand seized hold of the points, with the intention of extricating myself;\r\nbut before I could do so, the elk had risen to his feet, and with a\r\npowerful jerk of his head tossed me high into the air.  I came down upon\r\na thick network of vines and branches; and, my presence of mind still\r\nremaining, I clutched them as I fell, and held on.  It was well that I\r\ndid so, for directly under me the infuriated animal was bounding from\r\npoint to point, evidently in search of me and wondering where I had\r\ngone.  Had I fallen back to the earth, instead of clinging to the\r\nbranches, he would no doubt have crushed me to pieces with his powerful\r\nhorns.\r\n\r\n\"For some moments I lay quite helpless where I had been flung, watching\r\nwhat was passing below.  The mastiff still continued his attack, but was\r\nevidently cowed by the fate of his companion, and only snapped at the\r\nelk when he could get round to his flanks.  The other dog lay among the\r\nweeds howling piteously.\r\n\r\n\"At this moment Cudjo appeared in sight, for I had headed him some\r\ndistance in my haste.  I could see the whites of his great eyes turned\r\nup in wonderment when he perceived the rifle lying upon the ground\r\nwithout seeing me.  I had barely time to utter a shout of warning, when\r\nthe elk spied him; and lowering his head, rushed upon him with a loud\r\nand furious snort.\r\n\r\n\"I was filled with fear for my faithful follower and friend.  I saw that\r\nhe carried a large Indian spear--which he had found at the camp where\r\nour companions had been massacred--but I had no hope of his being able\r\nto ward off the impetuous attack.  I saw that he did not even point the\r\nweapon to receive the enraged animal, but stood like a statue.  `He is\r\nparalysed with terror,' thought I; and I expected the next moment to see\r\nhim impaled upon the sharp antlers and gored to death.  But I had very\r\nmuch mistaken my man Cudjo.  When the horns were within two feet of his\r\nbreast, he stepped nimbly behind a tree, and the elk passed him with a\r\nrush.  So quick had been the action, that for a moment I thought he had\r\ngone under; but, to my agreeable surprise, the next moment I saw him\r\nstart out from the tree, and, making a lounge with the spear, bury it\r\namong the ribs of the animal!  No matador in all Spain could have\r\nperformed the feat more cleverly.\r\n\r\n\"I shouted with delight as I saw the huge body rolling to the earth;\r\nand, dropping down from my perch, I ran toward the spot.  On reaching\r\nit, I found the elk panting in the throes of death, while Cudjo stood\r\nover his body safe and triumphant.\r\n\r\n\"`Bravo!' cried I, `my brave Cudjo, you have ended him in earnest!'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, Massa,' replied Cudjo, coolly, though evidently with some slight\r\nsymptoms of triumph in his manner; `yes, Massa Roff, dis black niggur\r\nhab gin de gemman a settler under de rib number five.  He butt de breath\r\nout of poor Cassy no more--poor ole Cassy!' and Cudjo commenced\r\ncaressing the dog Castor, which was the one that had suffered most from\r\nthe horns of the elk.\r\n\r\n\"We were now joined by Harry, who, hearing the struggle, could remain no\r\nlonger in the camp.  Fortunately we found his rifle quite safe; and\r\nCudjo drawing his knife, let the blood out of the animal in a scientific\r\nmanner.  From its great weight--not less than a thousand pounds--we saw\r\nthat we could not take the whole carcass to camp without yoking either\r\nthe horse or ox to it, so we resolved to skin and quarter it where it\r\nlay.  After going back for the necessary implements, as well as to\r\nannounce our success, we returned again, and soon finished the\r\noperation.  Before the sun had set, nearly a thousand pounds of fresh\r\nelk-meat were dangling from the trees around our little encampment.  We\r\nhad purposely delayed eating until our work should be done; and while\r\nCudjo and I were engaged in hanging up the huge quarters, Mary had been\r\nbusy with the gridiron, and an elk rump-steak--quite equal to the best\r\nbeef--added to the excellence of our supper.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nADVENTURE WITH THE CARCAJOU.\r\n\r\n\"We arose early next morning; and, having eaten a hearty breakfast of\r\nelk-steaks and coffee, began to consider what was the next thing to be\r\ndone.  We had now quite enough of meat to carry us to the end of the\r\nlongest journey, and it only remained to be cured, so that it would keep\r\non the way.  But how were we to cure it, when we had not a particle of\r\nsalt?  Here was a difficulty which for a moment looked us in the face.\r\nOnly for a moment, for I soon recollected that there was a way of\r\npreserving meat without salt, which has always been much in use among\r\nSpanish people, and in countries where salt is very scarce and dear.  I\r\nhad heard, too, that this method was much practised among the trappers\r\nand hunters when laying up a stock of buffalo flesh, or of any other\r\nanimals they might chance to kill.  It is called `jerking,' and the meat\r\nwhen thus prepared goes by the name of `jerked meat.'  By the Spaniards\r\nit is called `tasajo.'\r\n\r\n\"I remembered having read an account of the process, and after\r\ninstructing Cudjo in it, we immediately set about `jerking' the elk.  We\r\nfirst built a large fire, upon which we placed a great many sticks of\r\ngreen wood freshly cut from the tree.  This was done so that the fire\r\nmight burn slowly, and throw out a great volume of smoke.  We then stuck\r\nseveral stakes into the ground around the fire, and stretched lines from\r\none to the other.  This being done, we took down the quarters of the elk\r\nand removed the meat from the bones--cutting it off in thin strips, each\r\nof them over a yard in length.  These strips we hung over the lines\r\nalready prepared, so that they might be exposed to the smoke and heat of\r\nthe fire, although not so much as to cause them to be broiled.  The\r\nwhole process was now ended--excepting that it would be necessary for us\r\nto look occasionally to the fire, as well as to see that the dogs and\r\nwolves did not leap up and snap off the meat, that hung down from the\r\nlines like so many strings of sausages.  In about three days the flesh\r\nof the elk would be `jerked,' and capable of being, carried to any\r\ndistance without the danger of spoiling.\r\n\r\n\"During these three days we all remained very much in the neighbourhood\r\nof our camp.  We might have procured more game had we gone out to hunt\r\nfor it, but we did not do this for three reasons:--First, because we had\r\nenough for our wants; secondly, we did not wish, under the\r\ncircumstances, to waste a single charge of ammunition; and, lastly,\r\nbecause we had seen the tracks of bears and panthers by the stream.  We\r\ndid not wish to risk meeting with any of these customers in the dark and\r\ntangled woods, which we should have been likely enough to do, had we\r\ngone far out in pursuit of game.  We were determined to leave them\r\nunmolested as long as they should preserve a similar line of conduct\r\ntowards us; and, in order to prevent any of them from intruding into our\r\ncamp while we were asleep, we kept a circle of fires burning around the\r\nwagon throughout the night.\r\n\r\n\"During these three days, however, we were not without fresh viands, and\r\nthose, too, of the most luxurious and delicate kinds.  I had succeeded\r\nin killing a wild turkey, which, along with several others, had entered\r\nthe glade, and run close up to our camp before they saw us.  He was a\r\nlarge `gobbler'--over twenty pounds in weight--and, I need not tell you,\r\nproved far more delicious eating than his tame cousins of the farm-yard.\r\n\r\n\"At the end of the third day, the elk-meat was as dry as a chip; and\r\ntaking it from the lines we packed it in small bundles, and placed it in\r\nour wagon.  We now thought of waiting only until our animals should be\r\nfairly recruited; and as both horse and ox were up to their eyes, from\r\nmorning till night, in rich pasturage, and began to fill out about the\r\nflanks, we were congratulating ourselves that we should not have long to\r\nwait.\r\n\r\n\"Of how little value are human calculations!  Just at that moment, when\r\nwe were so sanguine of being able soon to escape from our desert prison,\r\nan event occurred, which rendered that escape altogether impossible--for\r\nyears at least, and it might have been, for ever.  But I will detail the\r\ncircumstance as it happened.\r\n\r\n\"It was on the afternoon of the fourth day after we had entered the\r\nvalley.  We had just finished dinner, and were sitting near the fire\r\nwatching the two children, Mary and Luisa, as they rolled in joyous\r\ninnocence over the smooth green sward.  My wife and I were conversing\r\nabout the little Luisa--about the unfortunate end of her father and\r\nmother--both of whom, we believed, had fallen victims in the savage\r\nmassacre.  We were talking of how we should bring her up--whether in\r\nignorance of the melancholy fate of her parents, and in the belief that\r\nshe was one of our own children--or whether, when she had grown to a\r\nsufficient age to understand it, we should reveal to her the sad story\r\nof her orphanage.  Our thoughts now reverted, for the first time, to our\r\nown wretched prospects, for these, too, had been blighted by the loss of\r\nour Scotch friend.  We were going to a strange land--a land where we\r\nknew no one--of whose language, even, we were ignorant--a land, too,\r\nwhose inhabitants were neither prosperous of themselves, nor disposed to\r\ncountenance prosperity in others--much less of the race to which we\r\nbelonged.  We were going, too, without an object; for that which had\r\nbrought us so far was now removed by the death of our friend.  We had no\r\nproperty--no money--not enough even to get us shelter for a single\r\nnight: what would become of us?  They were bitter reflections which we\r\ndrew from thinking on the future; but we did not permit them to torture\r\nus long.\r\n\r\n\"`Fear not, Robert,' said my noble wife, placing her hand in mine, and\r\nlooking cheerfully in my face; `_He_ who has guarded us through the past\r\nis not likely to fail us in the future.'\r\n\r\n\"`Dear Mary,' I replied, roused to new life and energy by her consoling\r\nwords, `you are right--you are right--in Him only let us trust.'\r\n\r\n\"At that moment a strange noise sounded in our ears, coming from the\r\ndirection of the forest.  It seemed distant at first, but every moment\r\ndrew nearer and nearer.  It was like the voice of some animal `routing'\r\nfrom extreme terror or pain.  I looked around for the ox.  The horse was\r\nin the glade, but his companion was not to be seen.  Again the voice\r\ncame from the woods, louder and more fearful than ever.  It was plainly\r\nthe bellowing of an ox; but what could it mean?  Once more it rose upon\r\nthe air, nearer and more distinct, and sounded as though the animal was\r\nrunning as it cried!\r\n\r\n\"I sprang to my rifle--Frank and Harry also seized theirs--Cudjo armed\r\nhimself with the Indian spear; and the dogs, that had started to their\r\nfeet, stood waiting a signal to rush forth.\r\n\r\n\"Once more broke out that terrible cry; and we could now hear the\r\nsweeping of leaves, and the crackling of branches, as if some huge\r\nanimal was tearing its way through the bushes.  The birds flew up from\r\nthe thicket, terrified and screaming--the horse neighed wildly--the dogs\r\nsent forth their impatient yelps, and our children shrieked in affright!\r\nAgain rose, the deep and sonorous roar, filling the valley with its\r\nagonising tones.  The cane rattled as it yielded to the crushing hoof.\r\nWe saw the leaves of the thick underwood shaking at a distance--then\r\nnearer--then up to the edge of the glade--and the next moment a bright\r\nred object appeared through the leaves, and dashed out into the opening.\r\nWe saw at a glance it was the ox; but what could it mean?  Was he\r\npursued by some monster--some beast of prey?  No! not pursued, but\r\nalready overtaken.  Look! see what the ox carries on his shoulders!  Oh,\r\nheavens! what a sight!\r\n\r\n\"We were all for a while as if paralysed.  Between the shoulders of the\r\nox, and clutching him around the neck, was a large animal.  It at first\r\nsight appeared to be a mass of brown shaggy hair, and part of the ox\r\nhimself--so closely was it fastened upon him.  As they drew nearer,\r\nhowever, we could distinguish the spreading claws and short muscular\r\nlimbs of a fearful creature.  Its head was down near the throat of the\r\nox, which we could see was torn, and dappled with crimson spots.  The\r\nmouth of the strange animal was resting upon his jugular vein.  It was\r\ntearing his flesh, and drinking his blood as he ran!\r\n\r\n\"The ox, as he came out of the thicket, galloped but slowly, and\r\nbellowed with less energy than before.  We could perceive that he\r\ntottered as he ran, still making for the camp.  In a short time, he was\r\nin our midst, when, uttering a long moan, he fell to the earth with the\r\ndeath-rattle in his throat!\r\n\r\n\"The strange animal, roused by the shock, suddenly let go its hold, and\r\nraised itself erect over the carcass.  Now, for the first time, I saw\r\nwhat it was.  It was the fearful _carcajou_!  Now, too, for the first\r\ntime, it seemed to be aware of our presence, and suddenly placed itself\r\nin an attitude to spring.  The next moment it had launched its body\r\ntowards Mary and the children!\r\n\r\n\"We all three fired as it sprang forward, but our feelings had unnerved\r\nus, and the bullets whistled idly away.  I drew my knife and rushed\r\nafter; but Cudjo was before me, and I saw the blade of his spear\r\nglancing towards it like a flash of light, and burying itself in the\r\nlong hair.  With a hoarse growl, the monster turned, and, to my joy, I\r\nsaw that it was impaled upon the spear, which had passed through the\r\nskin of its neck.  Instead of yielding, however, it rushed up the shaft,\r\nuntil Cudjo was compelled to drop the weapon, to save himself from being\r\ntorn by its long, fierce claws.  Before it could clear itself from the\r\nspear, I had drawn my large pistol, and fired directly into its breast.\r\nThe shot proved mortal; and the shaggy monster rolled over, and\r\nstruggled for some minutes in the agonies of death.  _We_ were saved;\r\nbut our poor ox, that was to have drawn us out of the Desert, lay upon\r\nthe grass a lifeless and almost bloodless carcase!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nA FRUITLESS SEARCH FOR A TRAIL.\r\n\r\n\"Our hopes of being able to get away from the oasis valley were thus\r\ncrushed in a moment.  The horse could not of himself draw the wagon, and\r\nhow could we travel without it?  Even could we have crossed the Desert\r\non foot, he would hardly suffice to carry our food and water.  But for\r\nus to pass one of those terrible stretches of wilderness--by the\r\nSpaniards called `jornadas'--on foot was out of the question.  Even the\r\nstrongest and hardiest of the trappers often perish in such attempts;\r\nand how should we succeed--one of us being a delicate female--and having\r\ntwo children that must be carried in our arms?  The thing was plainly\r\nimpossible; and as I reflected upon it, the thoughts of its\r\nimpossibility filled me with despair.\r\n\r\n\"But were we never to escape from that lonely spot?  What prospect was\r\nbefore us of ever being able to leave it?  No human beings might come to\r\nour relief.  Perhaps no human foot except our own had ever made its\r\ntrack in that remote valley!  This was not at all improbable; and indeed\r\na party of hunters or Indians, on their journey across the Desert, might\r\nvisit the mountain without discovering the valley,--so strangely was it\r\nhollowed out of the plain.\r\n\r\n\"I had but little hope that any caravan or party of traders would pass\r\nthat way.  The Desert that surrounded us was a sufficient barrier\r\nagainst that; besides, I knew that the mountain was far to the southward\r\nof the trails usually followed by the prairie traders.  There was but\r\none hope that I could cling to with any degree of confidence: that was,\r\nthat the Desert might not stretch so far to the south or west as it\r\nappeared to do; and by breaking up the wagon, and making a light cart\r\nout of it, we might still be able to cross it.  I was determined,\r\ntherefore, first to go alone, and explore the route in both these\r\ndirections.  If it should appear practicable, I could return, and put\r\nthis design into execution.\r\n\r\n\"Next morning, having loaded my horse with provisions, and as much water\r\nas he could well carry, I took an affectionate leave of my wife and\r\nlittle ones; and, commending them to the protection of God, I mounted,\r\nand rode off toward the west.  I headed in this direction for a day and\r\na half, and still the waste stretched to the horizon before me.  I had\r\nmade but a short journey, for the path led through ridges and hillocks\r\nof moving sand, and my horse sank to the knees at every step.  In the\r\nafternoon of the second day, I turned back from the attempt, fearful\r\nthat I should not be able to regain the valley.  But I succeeded at\r\nlength,--both myself and horse almost dead with thirst on arriving\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\"I found my little party all well, as I had left them; but I had brought\r\nthem no glad tidings, and I sat down in the midst of them with a feeling\r\nof despair.\r\n\r\n\"My next reconnoissance was to be to the south; and I only waited until\r\nmy jaded horse might be sufficiently rested for another journey.\r\n\r\n\"Another day passed, and I was sitting upon a log near the fire,\r\nreflecting upon the dark future that lay before us.  I was filled with\r\ndespondency, and took no note of what was passing around.  When I had\r\nsat in this way for some time, I felt a light hand touching me upon the\r\nshoulder; and, looking up, I saw that Mary had seated herself upon the\r\nlog beside me, while a smile of cheerfulness and composure was playing\r\nupon her features.\r\n\r\n\"I saw that she had something in her mind that she was about to\r\ncommunicate to me.\r\n\r\n\"`What is it, Mary?'  I asked.\r\n\r\n\"`Is not this a lovely spot?' said she, waving her hand so as to\r\nindicate the whole scene by which we were surrounded.  My eyes, along\r\nwith hers, roamed for a moment over the fair picture, and I could not do\r\notherwise than answer in the affirmative.  It was, indeed, a lovely\r\nspot.  The open glade, with the golden sun streaming down upon its green\r\nherbage, and vivid flowers--the varied tints of the forest frondage, now\r\ndressed in the brilliant lively of autumn--the cliffs beyond,\r\ncontrasting with it in colour from their lining of dark-green cedars and\r\npines--and, higher still, the snow-white summit, as it towered against\r\nthe blue sky, sparkling under the sun, and lending a delicious coolness\r\nto the air--all these objects formed a panorama that was indeed lovely\r\nto look upon.  And there were sweet sounds falling upon the ear--the\r\nmurmur of distant waters--the light rustling of leaves, stirred by a\r\nsoft breeze that blew past laden with the aromatic odours of buds and\r\nflowers--the music of birds that sang to each other in the groves, or\r\nuttered their joyous calls as they flapped their bright wings over the\r\nopen glade.\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, Mary,' I replied, `it is indeed a lovely spot.'\r\n\r\n\"`Then, Robert,' said she, with a look of strange meaning, `why should\r\nwe be so anxious to leave it?'\r\n\r\n\"`Why?'  I repeated mechanically after her, wondering at the question.\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, why?' continued my wife.  `We are in search of a home--why not\r\nmake _this_ our home?  Where can we find a better?  How know we that in\r\nthat land whither we were going, we may find one so good--if, indeed,\r\nthey give us a home at all?'\r\n\r\n\"`But, dear Mary,' said I, `how could you live away from the world--you\r\nwho have been brought up in the midst of society and its refinements?'\r\n\r\n\"`The world!' replied she, `what care we for the world?  Have we not our\r\nchildren with us?  They will be our world, and we can be society enough\r\nfor each other.  Moreover,' continued she, `remember how little we have\r\nin that world,--remember how it has used us so far.  Have we been happy\r\nin it?  No, I have enjoyed more happiness here than I ever did in the\r\nmidst of that society, of which you speak.  Think, Robert! reflect\r\nbefore we rashly leave this lovely spot--this sweet home--into which I\r\ncan almost believe the hand of God has guided us.'\r\n\r\n\"`But, Mary, you have not thought of the difficulties, the hardships to\r\nwhich such a life may expose you.'\r\n\r\n\"`I have,' she replied.  `I have thought of all these while you were\r\nabsent.  I can see no difficulty in our procuring a subsistence here.\r\nThe Creator has bountifully stocked this singular oasis.  We may easily\r\nobtain all the necessaries of life--for its luxuries I care but little.\r\nWe can live without them.'\r\n\r\n\"Her words produced a strange effect upon me.  Up to that moment the\r\nidea of _remaining_ in the oasis had never entered my mind.  I had only\r\noccupied myself with speculating on the means by which we could escape\r\nfrom it.  Now, however, a sudden change came over my thoughts; and I\r\nbegan to think seriously of following the counsel of my self-sacrificing\r\ncompanion.  The harsh treatment we had received at the hands of\r\ncivilised man--buffeted about by ill fortune--continually deceived, and\r\nat every step becoming poorer and more dependent, all had their effect\r\nin blunting that desire I should otherwise have felt to get back to the\r\nworld.  I was not averse then to the idea, but rather ready to fall at\r\nonce into the plan.\r\n\r\n\"I remained silent for a length of time, casting over in my mind the\r\npossibility of our carrying out such a scheme--the chances of our being\r\nable to procure subsistence.  It was evident there was plenty of game in\r\nthe valley.  We had occasionally seen deer of different species, and we\r\nhad also discovered the tracks of other animals.  There were pheasants\r\nand turkeys, too, in abundance.  We had our rifles, and by good fortune\r\na large stock of ammunition--for, besides my own, Harry and Frank had\r\npowder-horns containing nearly a pound each.  But this in time would be\r\nexpended--what then?  Oh, what then?  Before that I should find out some\r\nother mode of capturing our game.  Besides, the valley might contain\r\nmany other things intended to sustain life--roots and fruits.  We had\r\nalready found some indications of this; and Mary, who was an\r\naccomplished botanist, could tell the uses of them all.  We should find\r\nboth food and water.  What more could we ask from the hand of Nature?\r\n\r\n\"As I ran these thoughts through my mind, the project became every\r\nmoment more feasible.  In fact, I grew quite as enthusiastic about it as\r\nmy wife.\r\n\r\n\"Cudjo, Frank, and Harry, were brought into our council; and they, too,\r\nreceived the idea with delight.  The faithful Cudjo was contented, as he\r\nalleged, with any lot, so long as he might share it with us.  As for the\r\nboys they were in raptures with the thought of such a free wild life.\r\n\r\n\"We did not fully resolve upon anything for that day.  We were\r\ndetermined not to act rashly, but to reflect seriously upon it, and to\r\nrenew our deliberations on the following morning.\r\n\r\n\"During that night, however, a circumstance occurred, which at once\r\nfixed my resolution to remain in the valley--at least until some\r\nunforeseen chance might enable us to leave it with a better prospect of\r\nsafety.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERIOUS FLOOD.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my friends, I shall now detail to you the strange incident, which\r\nat once decided me to adopt the suggestion of my wife, and make our home\r\nin the valley.  Perhaps we did not, at the time, contemplate staying\r\nhere for the remainder of our lives--but only for a few years.  However,\r\nwe resolved to remain for the present, and give our lonely life a fair\r\ntrial, leaving the future an open question.\r\n\r\n\"The reason why I had hesitated at all upon the subject was this:--I\r\ncould not think of settling down with no prospect of improving our\r\ncondition; for, however much we might exercise our industry, its\r\nproducts could not enrich us beyond the satisfying of our own wants.  We\r\nshould have no market, thought I, for any superfluous produce, even\r\ncould we cultivate the whole valley.  We could, therefore, become no\r\nricher, and would never be in any fitter state to return to civilised\r\nsociety--for, in spite of all, a thought of this still remained in my\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\"Mary, who was of a far more contented disposition than I, still\r\npersisted in arguing that as our happiness did not depend upon\r\npossessing riches, we would never desire to leave that lovely spot, and\r\nthat, consequently, we should stand in no need of wealth.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps hers was the true philosophy--at all events, it was the natural\r\none.  But the artificial wants of society implant within us the desire\r\nof accumulating individual property; and I could not rid myself of this\r\nprovident feeling.  `If we could only find some object,' said I, `upon\r\nwhich we might be exercising our industry, so that _our time should not\r\nbe wasted_, and by which we might prepare ourselves for returning to\r\nsociety, then might we live most happily here.'\r\n\r\n\"`Who knows?' said Mary, in reply to this; `there may be objects in this\r\nvalley that may occupy us, and enable us to lay up the very store you\r\nspeak of, as well as if we were to continue on to New Mexico.  What\r\nopportunities should we have there better than here?  We have nothing\r\nnow to begin life with anywhere.  Here we have food and land, which I\r\nthink we may fairly call our own; there we should have neither.  Here we\r\nhave a home; and how know you, Robert, that we may not yet make a\r\nfortune in the Desert?'\r\n\r\n\"We both laughed at the idea; which, of course, Mary had meant only as a\r\njest in order to render our prospects more cheering.\r\n\r\n\"It was now near midnight, for we had sat up to that late hour\r\ndeliberating on what we should do.  As I have said, we agreed to leave\r\nthe matter undecided until the morrow.  The moon was just appearing over\r\nthe eastern cliff; and we were about rising to retire to our\r\nresting-places, when our eyes fell upon an object that caused us all at\r\nthe same time to cry out with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"I have said, that when we first entered this valley there was no lake\r\nhere.  Where you now see one, was a green sward, with here and there a\r\ncoppice of trees, forming part of the little prairie in which we were\r\nencamped.  The stream ran across it, as it still does through the lake;\r\nbut at this point there were scarcely any banks, as the water flowed\r\nover a wide and shallow channel.  On previous nights, when the moon was\r\nshining into the valley, as we sat around our camp fire, we had noticed\r\nthe stream winding like a silver thread through the dark-green herbage.\r\nNow, to our extreme wonder, instead of the narrow line, a broad sheet of\r\nwater glistened before us!  It seemed to cover a space of several\r\nhundred yards in extent, reaching far up the glade towards our camp.\r\nCould it be water, or was it only the _mirage_--the _fata morgana_?  No;\r\nit was not the latter.  We had witnessed this before, on our passage\r\nacross the great plains.  We had witnessed it on several occasions, and\r\nit was nothing like what we now saw.  There is a filmy, whitish\r\nappearance about the illusions of the _mirage_ by which the experienced\r\ntraveller can always distinguish it from the real.  But there was\r\nnothing of that in the present instance.  It was water that spread\r\nbefore us,--for the moon, that had now risen above the cliff, was\r\nplainly reflected upon its calm and glassy surface.  Yes; it could be\r\nnothing but a sheet of water!\"  But we were determined not to trust to\r\nour eyes alone.  We all ran towards it--Cudjo, the boys, and myself,--\r\nand in a few seconds we stood upon its edge--upon the edge of what\r\nappeared to be a large lake, formed as if by some magical influence!\r\n\r\n\"We had at first regarded the phenomenon only with feelings of wonder;\r\nbut our wonder was now changed to consternation, when we perceived that\r\nthe water was still rising!  It ran in about our feet while we stood,\r\nrippling slowly against the gentle ascent like the influx of a tide.\r\n\r\n\"`What could it mean?' we asked of each other, with looks that betrayed\r\nour fears.  Was it a flood--an inundation--a sudden swelling of the\r\nstream?  This it plainly was, but what could have caused it?  There had\r\nbeen no rain for several days before, and no great heat to have caused\r\nany unusual melting of the snow upon the mountain.  What, then, could be\r\nthe origin of this sudden and singular freshet?  What could it mean?\r\n\r\n\"We stood for some time silent, with hearts beating audibly,--each\r\nlooking at the others for an answer to this question.  The solution\r\nseemed to strike us all at the same time, and a fearful one it was.\r\nSome terrible convulsion--the falling of the precipice perhaps--had\r\ndammed the canon below; no doubt, had blocked up the great fissure by\r\nwhich the stream found its way from the valley.  If such were the case,\r\nthen, the valley would soon fill with water, not only to cover the\r\nground occupied by our camp, _but the tops of the highest trees_!\r\n\r\n\"You will easily conceive the terror with which this thought was\r\ncalculated to inspire us.  We could think of no other cause for the\r\nstrange inundation; nor, indeed, did we stay longer to consider of any,\r\nbut ran back to the camp, determined to escape from the valley as soon\r\nas we could.  Cudjo caught the horse, Mary awoke the children, and\r\nbrought them out of the wagon, while the boys and I busied ourselves in\r\ncollecting a few necessary things, that we might be enabled to carry\r\nalong with us.\r\n\r\n\"Up to this time we had not thought of the difficulty--much less the\r\n_impossibility--of escaping from the valley_.  To our horror, that now\r\nbecame clear as the sun at noon-day; for we perceived that the road by\r\nwhich we had entered the glade, and which lay along the stream, was\r\ncompletely covered, and the rising water reached far beyond it!  There\r\nwas no other path by which we could get out.  To attempt cutting one\r\nthrough the thick tangled woods would be the work of days; moreover, we\r\nremembered that we had crossed the stream on the way to our camp, and\r\nthat, of course, would now be swollen below, so that to re-cross it\r\nwould be impossible.  We had no doubt but that the valley, at its lower\r\nend, was by this time filled with water, and our retreat in that\r\ndirection completely cut off!  _We knew of no other path_!\r\n\r\n\"I cannot describe the state of mind into which we were thrown, when\r\nthese facts became evident to one and all of us.  We were about to start\r\nout from the camp, each of us carrying our burden; but it was plainly of\r\nno use making the attempt, and we let fall the various utensils with a\r\nfeeling of despair.  The water was still rising--_the lake was growing\r\nlarger_!\r\n\r\n\"The wolves howled, driven from their lair by the encroaching element--\r\nbirds, roused from their sleep, screamed and fluttered among the trees--\r\nour dogs barked at the strange sight--and, in the clear moonlight, we\r\ncould see deer, and other wild animals, rushing, as if terrified,\r\nthrough the open glade.  O God! were we to be engulfed, and perish in\r\nthis mysterious flood?\r\n\r\n\"What was to be done?  Should we climb into the trees?  That would not\r\nsave us.  If the great channel was blocked up below, I knew that _that_\r\nwould not save us; for its jaws were higher than the tops of the highest\r\ntrees, and the rising flood would soon wash us from the branches.  It\r\nmight prolong our lives, and with them our despair; but what--`Ha!'  The\r\nthought, heaven-directed, at this moment entered my mind.\r\n\r\n\"`_A raft! a raft! we shall yet be saved_!'\r\n\r\n\"My companions at once understood my meaning.  Cudjo seized the axe,\r\nwhile Mary hastened to the wagon to collect such ropes and cords as were\r\nin it.  I knew there would not be enough of these for our purpose; and,\r\nspreading out the great elk-skin, I proceeded to cut it into stripes.\r\n\r\n\"There were several logs lying close to our camp.  They were the trunks\r\nof tall straight trees, that, from time to time, had fallen, and were\r\nnow quite dead and dry.  They were the trunks of the beautiful\r\n_rhododendrons_, or tulip-trees, out of which the Indians always make\r\ntheir canoes, when they can get them of sufficient size.  This, because\r\ntheir wood is extremely soft and light--weighing only twenty-six pounds\r\nto the cubic foot.  While busy myself, I directed Cudjo to cut a number\r\nof these logs into equal lengths.  Cudjo knew how to handle an axe with\r\nany man; and the logs were soon of the proper dimensions.  We now rolled\r\nthem together, and, by the aid of our ropes and cross pieces, lashed\r\nthem firmly to one another; and our raft was completed.  Upon this we\r\nplaced our great chest containing the jerked meat, with our blankets,\r\nand such utensils as were necessary to be saved.  We laid in no stock of\r\nwater for the expected voyage--we had no fear about our having enough of\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\"We had been occupied nearly two hours in constructing the raft; but\r\nduring all this time we had been so busy, that we had hardly looked in\r\nthe direction of the flood--only to see that it still continued to rise.\r\nAs soon as our arrangements were completed, I ran down to the water's\r\nedge.  After watching it for a few minutes, to my great joy I perceived\r\nthat _the flood was at a stand_!  I shouted the glad news to my\r\ncompanions, who, on hearing it, hastened to join me, and assure\r\nthemselves by actual observation.  For half-an-hour, we all stood upon\r\nthe shore of the new-formed lake, until we became convinced that its\r\nwaters were rising no higher.  We saw, too, that they did not subside,\r\nbut remained stationary.  `It has reached the top of whatever has dammed\r\nit,' thought we, `and is now flowing over.'\r\n\r\n\"`What a pity, Massa Roff,' said Cudjo, as we wended our way back to the\r\ncamp; `what a pity we make dat fine raff for nuffin!'\r\n\r\n\"`Ah, Cudjo,' rejoined my wife, `we should never regret having performed\r\nthat which is a work of precaution; and we must remember that the raft--\r\nalthough it may not be required as we intended it--has already far more\r\nthan repaid us for the labour bestowed upon it.  Remember the misery we\r\nwere suffering but a short time since, and from which the idea of this\r\nraft at once relieved us.  Measures of precaution, however irksome,\r\nshould always be adopted.  It is only the slothful and vacillating who\r\neither neglect or regret them.'\r\n\r\n\"`Dat's true, Missa--dat's berry true,' said Cudjo, in a serious tone,\r\nfor he well knew how to appreciate the teachings of his noble mistress.\r\n\r\n\"It was now very late, or rather very early, and Mary, with the\r\nchildren, returned to their usual resting-place in the wagon.  Cudjo and\r\nI, fearing to trust to the capricious water, determined--lest it might\r\ntake another turn, and `catch us napping'--to keep watch on it till the\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE BEAVERS AND WOLVERENE.\r\n\r\n\"When daylight came, the mysterious flood was still standing at its full\r\nheight.  I call it mysterious, for as yet we knew nothing of what had so\r\nsuddenly created it.  We could think of no other cause than the falling\r\nin of the precipice below.  I had determined, as soon as the day fairly\r\nbroke, to make my way through the woods, and remove all doubt--for we\r\nstill felt some uneasiness in regard to this strange phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\"Leaving Cudjo with his long spear, and the boys with their rifles, to\r\nguard the camp, I set forth alone.  I took with me my gun, as well as a\r\nsmall hatchet which we had, to clear away a track through the brushwood.\r\n\r\n\"I struck at once into the woods, and guiding myself by an occasional\r\nglimpse of the sun that had now risen, I kept on in a south-easterly\r\ncourse.  It was my intention to get out on the edge of the flood some\r\ndistance below, when I could then skirt around it.  After cutting my way\r\nthrough the brambles to the distance of nearly a mile, I came suddenly\r\nout upon the bank of the rivulet; and guess my surprise, on seeing that\r\nthe stream was not only not swollen, but there was even less water than\r\nusual running in its channel!  I noticed, however, that the water was\r\nmuddy, and that green leaves and fresh broken twigs were floating down\r\nupon its current.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I now turned my face up-stream, knowing that the dam must be\r\nin that direction; but, for my life, I could not imagine how any\r\naccident of Nature could have stopped up the channel above.  The falling\r\nof trees could not possibly have produced such an effect; and there were\r\nno high bluffs abutting on the rivulet, that could have fallen into its\r\nbed.  I began to believe that human hands had been at work; and I looked\r\nfor the prints of human feet.  I saw none, but the tracks of animals\r\nwere numerous.  Thousands of them, at least--great broad feet, webbed\r\nlike those of a duck, but with sharp claws--were impressed in the sand\r\nand mud, all along the banks of the stream.\r\n\r\n\"I moved forward very cautiously; for, although I could not discover\r\ntheir tracks, I was still fearful that Indians, and of course enemies,\r\nwere near.  At length, I reached a bend in the stream, above which I\r\nremembered that the channel was narrower, and ran between banks of a\r\nconsiderable height.  I remembered it well--for, on first entering the\r\nvalley, we had been obliged at this place to draw the wagon out of the\r\nbed of the rivulet, and cut a way for it through the adjacent woods.  No\r\ndoubt, then, I would there find the obstacle that had so mysteriously\r\nintercepted the current.\r\n\r\n\"On reaching this bend, I climbed out upon the bank; and, stealing\r\nsilently through the underwood, peeped through the leaves.  A most\r\nsingular scene was before me.\r\n\r\n\"The stream, as I had rightly conjectured, was dammed up, at the point\r\nwhere the channel was narrowest, but not by any accident.  The work bore\r\nthe marks of design, as much as if it had been constructed by human\r\nhands.  A tall tree had been felled across the stream--so that the place\r\nwhere it had been cut through was not detached from the stump, but still\r\nheld fast by its crushed fibres.  On the other side its top branches\r\nwere buried under rocks and mud, so as to render them secure.  Against\r\nthis tree upright stakes rested; and these again were wattled together,\r\nand firmly bedded in rocks that had been collected around their lower\r\nends.  Behind these uprights were piled other stakes and branches laid\r\ncrosswise, and bound together with layers of rocks and mud--so that the\r\nwhole structure formed a wall of full six feet in thickness--broad along\r\nthe top, and sloping off toward the water.  On the lower side it stood\r\nnearly perpendicular, as the uprights were thus set.  The top of this\r\nwas plastered with mud, and at both sides was left a narrow sluice, or\r\nwash, through which the water ran smoothly off, without wearing away the\r\nbreastwork.\r\n\r\n\"I have said that the work bore the marks of design, as much as if it\r\nhad been constructed by human hands.  But it was not.  The builders of\r\nthat breastwork were before my eyes, and apparently just resting from\r\ntheir labours.\r\n\r\n\"There were about an hundred of them in all, squatting over the ground,\r\nand along the parapet of the new-made dam.  They were of a dark-brown,\r\nor rather a chestnut colour; and reminded me of so many gigantic rats--\r\nexcept that their tails were pot elongated and tapering like these.\r\nTheir backs, however, were arched, and their bodies of a thick rounded\r\nshape, similar to animals of the rat kind.  Moreover, I could perceive\r\nthat they were armed with the cutting teeth, which distinguish the\r\nfamily of the _rodentia_, or `gnawers.'  These teeth I could see\r\ndistinctly--as some of the animals were using them at the time, and they\r\neven protruded when their mouths were shut.  I noticed that there was a\r\npair of them in each jaw, broad, strong, and shaped like chisels.  The\r\nears of the animals were short, and almost buried in the hair, which\r\nalthough long was not shaggy, but presented a smooth appearance over all\r\nparts of their bodies.  There was a tuft of stiff bristles growing out\r\non each side of the nose, like the whiskers of a cat; and their eyes\r\nwere small, and set high up, like those of the otter.  Their fore limbs\r\nwere shorter than the hind ones, and both had feet with five claws, but\r\nthe hind feet were broad and large, and completely webbed between the\r\ntoes.  It was they, then, that had made the tracks I had observed in\r\ncoming up the stream.  But the most striking feature of these animals\r\nwas the tail.  This appendage was entirely without hair, of a dark\r\ncolour, and looking as though it was covered with the well-known\r\nsubstance shagreen.  It was about a foot in length, several inches broad\r\nand thick, and not at all unlike a cricket bat--except that it appeared\r\nheavier and more oval-shaped at the end.  The animals were somewhat\r\nlarger than otters, not so long, but much thicker and heavier in the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\"I had never seen such creatures before, but I knew at once what they\r\nwere--for although I had neglected my other studies, natural history had\r\nalways been my favourite, and I had made some progress in that.  I knew,\r\nthen, that the strange beings before me were _beavers_--the _castor\r\nfibre_ of the naturalists.\r\n\r\n\"The whole mystery was now explained.  A colony of beavers had migrated\r\ninto the valley, and constructed their dam; and this it was which had\r\ncaused the sudden inundation.\r\n\r\n\"I remained for some time, after I had made the discovery, watching\r\nthese creatures and their interesting movements.  The breastwork\r\nappeared to be quite finished; but this did not follow from the fact\r\nthat the animals were no longer at work upon it, as it is only by night\r\nthey perform such labour.  In fact, they are rarely seen except by\r\nnight, in countries where they have been disturbed or hunted; but here\r\nthey were evidently unaccustomed to man.  They appeared to be resting\r\nafter their night's work, it is not likely that they had built the whole\r\nbreastwork during that one night, but had only put on the finishing part\r\nwhich had produced the sudden flood.  As the glade above where they had\r\ndammed the rivulet was nearly level, a very small stoppage in the stream\r\nsufficed to inundate a large extent of ground, as it had actually done.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the beavers were sitting upon the newly-raised work, gnawing\r\nthe leaves and twigs that stuck out from the mud; others were washing\r\nthemselves, disporting playfully through the water; while others\r\nsquatted upon logs that lay along the edge of the dam, every now and\r\nagain flapping their heavy tails upon the water, like so many\r\nlaundresses beating out their wet linen.\r\n\r\n\"It was a curious and comical sight; and, after having enjoyed it for\r\nsome time, I was about to step forward to witness what effect my\r\npresence would produce, when, all at once, I perceived that some other\r\nobject had created a sudden commotion among the animals.  One of them,\r\nwho had been stationed upon a log at some distance up the lake, and\r\napparently acting as a sentry, now ran out upon the log, and struck the\r\nwater three quick heavy flaps with his tail.  This was evidently a\r\nsignal; for, the moment he had given it, the animal, as if pursued,\r\npitched himself head-foremost into the lake, and disappeared.  The rest\r\nstarted as soon as they heard it; and looking around for a moment, as if\r\nin affright, they all ran to the bank, and plunged simultaneously under\r\nthe water--each of them striking a blow with his tail as he disappeared!\r\n\r\n\"I now looked for the cause of this sudden movement.  All at once I\r\nperceived, coming around the lake where the sentry-beaver had\r\ndisappeared, a strange-looking animal.  It moved slowly and silently,\r\nskulking among the trees, and keeping close in upon the water's edge.  I\r\nsaw that it was making for the new-built dam, and I remained where I was\r\nto watch it.  At length it reached the breastwork, and crawled\r\ncautiously along it, keeping behind the parapet--so as not to be seen\r\nfrom the lake above.\r\n\r\n\"I had now a good view of it, and a vicious-looking creature it was.  It\r\nwas not much larger than one of the beavers themselves; and in some\r\npoints not unlike them; but in other respects the difference was marked.\r\nIt was of a very different colour--being nearly black upon the back and\r\nbelly, while a light brown strip traversed both its sides, meeting over\r\nits rump.  Its nose and feet were completely black, while its breast and\r\nthroat were white, and a whitish ring was around each of the eyes.  It\r\nhad small ears, with stiff bristles at the nose, and a short and bushy\r\ntail.  The hair over its whole body was long and shaggy.  Its legs were\r\nthick and muscular, and so short that, when it moved, its belly seemed\r\nto trail along the ground.  It appeared rather to crawl than to walk--\r\nbut this arose from the fact of its being an animal of the plantigrade\r\nfamily; and using its feet to walk upon--which in many other animals,\r\nsuch as the horse, appear to form part of the legs.  With the animal in\r\nquestion the feet were long, black, and armed with white curving claws.\r\nIts whole appearance was that of a carnivorous creature--in other words,\r\nit was a beast of prey.  It was the _Wolverene_, the dreaded enemy of\r\nthe beavers.\r\n\r\n\"On arriving near the middle of the breastwork, it stopped; and,\r\nplanting its forefeet up against the parapet, raised its head slowly,\r\nand looked over into the lake.\r\n\r\n\"Although the beaver is an amphibious animal, and spends full half of\r\nhis time in the water, he cannot remain long, without coming to the\r\nsurface to take breath; and already the heads of several were seen at\r\ndifferent points in the lake.  Others, again, had boldly climbed out on\r\nthe little islets which here and there appeared above water, and where\r\nthey knew that the wolverene, who is not a good swimmer, could not reach\r\nthem.  None of them, however, showed any signs of returning to the\r\nbreastwork.\r\n\r\n\"The wolverene seemed also to have arrived at this conclusion; for now--\r\napparently careless of being seen from the lake--he looked around him on\r\nall sides and above, as if he either intended giving up the pursuit of\r\nhis prey, or adopting some more effective measure to secure it.  At\r\nlength he appeared to have formed some resolution, and leaping boldly up\r\non the parapet, so as to be seen by the beavers, he walked back again\r\nalong the water's edge whence he had come.  On getting a good distance\r\nfrom the breastwork, he stopped for a moment; and then, turning away\r\nfrom the lake, ran off into the woods.\r\n\r\n\"I was curious to see whether the beavers would now return to the\r\nbreastwork, and I resolved to remain a while longer without showing\r\nmyself.  I waited about five minutes or more, at the end of which time I\r\nsaw several of them--who had gone to the most distant islets--plunge\r\ninto the water and come swimming towards me.  As I was watching them,\r\nall at once I heard a rustling among the fallen leaves near the dam; and\r\non looking I perceived the wolverene making all the haste he could\r\ntoward the breastwork.  On reaching it, however, instead of running out\r\nbehind the parapet as before, I saw him plant his long claws against a\r\ntree, and commence climbing upward, keeping on that side farthest from\r\nthe lake.  The branches of this tree stretched horizontally out, and\r\ndirectly over the breastwork.  In a short time the wolverene had reached\r\nthe fork of one of these; and, crawling out upon it, he laid himself\r\nflat along the branch and looked downward.\r\n\r\n\"He had scarcely settled himself on his perch, when half-a-dozen\r\nbeavers--thinking from what they had seen that he must have gone clear\r\noff--climbed out upon the breastwork, flapping their great tails as they\r\ncame.  They were soon under the very branch, and I saw the wolverene\r\nwith his legs erected and ears set for the spring.  This was my time;\r\nand glancing up the barrel of my rifle, I aimed directly for his heart.\r\nAt the crack, the astonished beavers leaped back into the water, while\r\nthe wolverene dropped from his perch--a little sooner, perhaps, than he\r\nhad intended--and rolled over the ground evidently wounded.  I ran up\r\nand struck at him with the butt-end of my gun, intending to finish him;\r\nbut, to my astonishment, the fierce brute seized the stock in his teeth,\r\nand almost tore it in pieces!  For some time I hammered him with huge\r\nstones--he all the while endeavouring to lay hold of me with his long\r\ncurved claws--and it was not until I got a down-blow at his head with my\r\naxe that the fight was ended.  A fearful-looking monster he was as he\r\nlay stretched before me, and not unlike the carcajou which had killed\r\nour ox at the camp, only smaller.  I did not attempt to take his carcass\r\nwith me, as it was a useless burden.  Moreover, from the fetid smell\r\nwhich he emitted, I was glad to part company as soon as I had killed\r\nhim; and, leaving him where he lay, I took the shortest road back to the\r\ncamp.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUILD A LOG-CABIN.\r\n\r\n\"I need not describe the joy of my wife and the rest when I returned,\r\nand related to them what I had seen, as well as my adventure with the\r\nwolverene.  The discovery that our new-made lake was nothing else than a\r\ngreat beaver-dam at once decided the question as to our remaining in the\r\nvalley.  Here was a source of wealth to us far greater than would have\r\nbeen any situation in the mines of Mexico--in fact, better than a mine\r\nitself.  The skin of every beaver in that dam I knew to be worth a\r\nguinea and a half.  I saw there were at least an hundred of them--there\r\nmight be many more--and how soon would these multiply into thousands,\r\nproducing annually four or five young to every pair of them.  We could\r\ntend them--taking care to provide them with food--and destroy the\r\nwolverenes and any other of their enemies, that might exist in the\r\nvalley.  They would thus increase the faster, and we could easily\r\nprevent them from becoming too numerous by trapping the older ones, and\r\ncarefully preserving their skins.  After several years thus employed, we\r\ncould return to civilised life, carrying with us enough of their\r\nvaluable fur to sell for a smart fortune.\r\n\r\n\"The prospect of staying where we were was now delightful--the more so,\r\nas I was satisfied it was the best thing I could do.  Even had I been\r\nable to procure a pair of fresh oxen at that moment, I should not have\r\nmoved a step farther.  What Mary had said in jest was now likely to be\r\nrealised in earnest, _We might yet make our fortune in the Desert_!\r\n\r\n\"Of course, it was a settled point--we resolved to remain.\r\n\r\n\"The first thing to be done, then, was to provide ourselves with a\r\nhouse.  It would be a `log-cabin,' of course; and putting up a log-cabin\r\nwas a mere bagatelle to Cudjo.  During our residence in Virginia, he had\r\nbuilt two or three on my farm; and no man knew better than he how to do\r\nthe thing.  No man knew better than he how to shape the logs, notch\r\nthem, and lay them firmly in their beds--no man knew better how to split\r\nthe `clap-boards,' lay them on the rafters, and bind them fast, without\r\neven a single nail--no man knew how to `chink' the walls, clay the\r\nchimney, and hang the door of a log-cabin better than Cudjo.  No.  I\r\nwill answer for that--Cudjo could construct a log-cabin as well as the\r\nmost renowned architect in the world.\r\n\r\n\"There was plenty of the right kind of timber at hand--plenty of\r\ntulip-trees with their tall straight trunks rising to the height of\r\nfifty feet without a branch; and for the next two days the axe of Cudjo\r\ncould be heard with its constant `check--check,' while every now and\r\nthen the crash of a falling tree woke the echoes of the valley.  While\r\nCudjo was felling the timber and cutting it into logs of a proper\r\nlength, none of the rest of us were idle.  In cooking our meals,\r\nscouring the vessels, and looking after the children, Mary found\r\nsufficient employment; while Frank, Harry, and I, with the help of our\r\nhorse Pompo, were able to drag the logs forward to the spot where we had\r\ndesigned to put up the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"On the third day, Cudjo notched the logs, and on the fourth we raised\r\nthe walls up to the square.  On the fifth, we set up the gables and\r\nrafters, which, you know, is done by shortening the gable-logs\r\nsuccessively, as you go upward, and tying each pair of them by a pair of\r\nrafters notched into them, at the ends, precisely as the wall-logs\r\nbelow.  A ridge-pole completed the frame, and that was laid by the\r\nevening of the fifth day.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the sixth day, Cudjo went to work upon a large oak which he had\r\nfelled and cut into lengths of about four feet each, at the beginning of\r\nour operations.  It was now somewhat dry, so as to split easily; and\r\nwith his axe and a set of wedges he attacked it.  By sunset, he had a\r\npile of clap-boards beside him as large as a wagon--quite enough to\r\n`shingle' the roof of our house.  During that day, I employed myself in\r\ntempering the clay for chinking the walls and plastering the chimney.\r\n\r\n\"On the seventh day, we all rested from our labour.  We did so because\r\nit was Sunday.  We had resolved ever to keep the Sabbath.  Though the\r\neyes of men could not see us--which I fear is too often the reason for\r\nobserving the sacred day--we knew that the eye of God was upon us, even\r\nin that remote valley.\r\n\r\n\"We rose as early as usual, and after eating our breakfast, the Bible\r\nwas brought forth, and we offered--the only sacrifice to Him\r\nacceptable--the sacrifice of our humble prayers.  Mary had been busy\r\nduring the week, and our little ones were dressed out, as if for a\r\nholiday.  Taking them along with us, we all walked down to the lake and\r\nsome distance around its edge.  We saw that the beavers had been as busy\r\nin building as we; and already their cone-shaped dwellings appeared\r\nabove the water--some of them near the shore, and others upon the little\r\nislets.  There was only one which we could reach, and this we examined\r\nwith great curiosity.  It stood only a few yards from the shore, but at\r\na place where the water was deep on its front side.  It was nearly\r\ncone-shaped, or rather the form of a bee-hive; and was constructed out\r\nof stones, sticks and mud mixed with grass.  Part of it was under water,\r\nbut although we could not look into the interior, we knew that there was\r\nan upper story above water-mark--for we saw the ends of the joists that\r\nsupported the second floor.  The entrance was toward the centre of the\r\nlake and under the water--so that in going out of and into his house,\r\nthe beaver is always under the necessity of making a dive.  But he does\r\nnot mind that, as it seems to be rather a pleasure to him than an\r\ninconvenience.  There was no entrance toward the land, as we had often\r\nheard.  Indeed, it would be bad policy in the beaver, thus to make a\r\ndoor by which his enemy, the wolverene, could easily get in and destroy\r\nhim.  The houses were all plastered over with mud, which, by the\r\nflapping of the tails and the constant paddling of the broad web-feet,\r\nhad become as smooth as if the mud had been laid on with a trowel.  We\r\nknew that they were also plastered inside, so as to render them warm and\r\ncommodious in winter.\r\n\r\n\"Some of these dwellings were not regular cones, but rather of an oval\r\nshape; and sometimes two were placed, as it were, `under one roof,' so\r\nas to steady them in the water, and save labour in the building.  They\r\nwere all pretty large--many of them rising the height of a man above the\r\nsurface of the lake, and with broad tops, where the beavers delighted to\r\nsit and sun themselves.  Each house was built by its own inhabitants,\r\nand each of them was inhabited by a single pair of beavers--man and\r\nwife--and in some instances where there were families by four or five.\r\nSome of them who had finished their houses earlier than the rest, had\r\nalready commenced gathering their provisions for the winter.  These\r\nconsisted of the leaves and soft twigs of several species of trees--such\r\nas willow, birch, and mulberry--and we saw collections of these floating\r\nin the water in front of several of the houses.\r\n\r\n\"It was late in the season for beavers to be constructing a new dam.  It\r\nis generally in spring when they perform that labour; but it was evident\r\nthat the present colony had just arrived--no doubt driven by trappers or\r\nIndians, or perhaps drought, from their last settlement, hundreds of\r\nmiles away.  We conjectured that they must have come up the stream that\r\nran away to the eastward.\r\n\r\n\"They must have entered the valley some time before we discovered them,\r\nas it would have taken them several days to gnaw down the trees and\r\naccumulate the materials for the dam that had so suddenly started up to\r\nalarm us.  Some of these trees were nearly a foot in diameter, while\r\nmany of the stones--which they had rolled up or carried between their\r\nfore-paws and throat--would have weighed nearly a score of pounds.\r\n\r\n\"It was evident, then, they had arrived late in the season, and had\r\nworked hard to get ready for the winter.  But Cudjo and I were\r\ndetermined, as soon as we should have finished our building operations,\r\nto lend them a hand in laying in their stock of provisions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE SAGACIOUS SQUIRREL.\r\n\r\n\"While we thus stood watching the movements of our beavers, and\r\nconversing about the habits of these interesting animals, an incident\r\noccurred which very much amused us, and proved that the beavers were not\r\nthe only animals whom Nature had gifted with extraordinary sagacity.\r\n\r\n\"Near the middle of the lake stood a clump of tall trees--their trunks\r\nimmersed for two or three feet under the water.  These trees had been\r\nupon the bank of the rivulet, previous to the formation of the dam; and\r\nthey were now surrounded on all sides, forming a kind of timber islet.\r\nIt was evident, however, that they were destined to decay, as they were\r\ntrees of the poplar species, and such as could not live with their roots\r\ncovered with water.\r\n\r\n\"Among the tops of these trees we observed several small animals leaping\r\nnimbly about from branch to branch and from one tree to the other.  They\r\nwere squirrels.  They seemed to be labouring under some unusual\r\nexcitement--as though they had been alarmed by the presence of an enemy.\r\nBut there did not appear to be any such enemy near them.  We noticed\r\nthat they passed from tree to tree, running down the trunks of each, as\r\nfar as the water would allow them; and then, after looking outward, as\r\nif they intended to leap into the lake, they would suddenly turn back\r\nagain, and gallop up into the high branches.  There were in all about a\r\ndozen of them; but the nimbleness with which they passed from place to\r\nplace, would have led one to believe that there were ten times that\r\nnumber; and the twigs and leaves were constantly kept in motion, as\r\nthough a large flock of birds were fluttering through them.\r\n\r\n\"We had noticed these animals before, from time to time, dashing about\r\nin the same clump of trees; but not thinking it anything unusual, had\r\npaid no attention to their movements.  Now, however, it occurred to us\r\nthat these little creatures--who never take to the water unless\r\ncompelled by absolute necessity--had been suddenly cut off from their\r\nusual range by the forming of the dam, and were held where they were in\r\na state of captivity.  This was the more evident, as the trees had been\r\nstripped of many of their leaves, and the bark was peeled from the more\r\ntender twigs and branches.  It was plain that the squirrels had been\r\nliving for some time upon short allowance, and were anxious to get off\r\nfrom the place.\r\n\r\n\"We now saw what was causing the unusual commotion among them at that\r\nparticular time.  Near the clump of trees, but higher up the lake, a\r\nsmall log was floating in the water.  It had somehow got into the stream\r\nabove, and was being borne down by the current.  It was at this moment\r\nnearing the little island of timber upon which were the squirrels; but\r\nit came on very slowly, as the current through the lake was hardly\r\nperceptible.  It was this log that was causing such a flurry; and the\r\nanimals evidently intended--should it come near enough--to use it as a\r\nraft.\r\n\r\n\"We seated ourselves to watch their manoeuvres.  On came the log slowly\r\nand gradually; but, instead of drifting directly for the timber, it was\r\nborne by the current in a direction that would carry it at least twenty\r\nyards from the trees.  The squirrels had gathered upon that side; and\r\nnow, instead of running up and down the trunks, as before, they all\r\nstood upon the topmost branches apparently watching the motions of the\r\nlog.\r\n\r\n\"`Poor little creatures!' said Mary, `they will be unable to reach it,\r\nafter all.  What a pity!'\r\n\r\n\"Just as she made this reflection, the log floated forward to the point\r\nwhere it was likely to be nearest to the clump in passing.  A long\r\nbranch stretched out in that direction; but, as we calculated, the\r\ndriftwood was not likely to pass nearer than twenty yards.  On this\r\nbranch, however, the squirrels had now gathered, one behind the other in\r\na long string, and we could see the foremost of them straining himself\r\nas if to spring.\r\n\r\n\"`Surely, they do not intend,--surely, they cannot leap so far!' said\r\nMary, as we all stood holding our breath, and watching them with intense\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, Missa,' replied Cudjo; `de do intend.  Gosh! de leap him, too.\r\nDis nigga see 'em in Vaginny leap far furrer.  Looky now!  Yonder de\r\ngo--wap!'\r\n\r\n\"As Cudjo spoke, the foremost squirrel launched out into the air, and\r\nthe next moment pounced down upon the log.  Then another followed, and\r\nanother, and another, looking like so many birds flying through the air\r\nin a string, until the log was covered with the little creatures, and\r\nfloated off with its cargo!\r\n\r\n\"We supposed that they had all succeeded in getting off, but in this we\r\nwere mistaken.  On looking up to the trees again, we saw that there was\r\nstill one remaining.  He appeared not to have got out upon the\r\nprojecting branch in time,--for the weight of each of those that\r\npreceded him, coming down upon the log had pushed it so far off, that he\r\nbecame, no doubt, afraid to venture taking such a long leap.  He was now\r\nrunning to and fro, apparently in a frantic state--both on account of\r\nhis inability to escape, and his being thus left alone.  For some time\r\nhe kept springing from tree to tree, running down the trunks of all to\r\nthe very edge of the water, and stopping now and again to look\r\nhopelessly after his companions.\r\n\r\n\"At length, we saw him descend a tree, whose bark was exceedingly\r\nrough--in fact, crisped outward in great broad pieces, or scales of a\r\nfoot long, and several inches broad, that looked as though they were\r\nabout to fall from the tree.  For this reason, the tree is known among\r\nbackwoodsmen as the `scaly bark.'  Having descended this tree, nearly to\r\nthe point where it rose above the water, the squirrel was seen to stop;\r\nand for a moment we lost sight of him, where he was hidden behind one of\r\nthe broad pieces of bark.  We thought he had taken shelter there,\r\nintending to rest himself.  Presently, however, we saw the bark moving\r\nbackwards and forwards; and from what we could see of the little animal,\r\nit was evident he was trying with all his might to detach it from the\r\ntree.  Occasionally he ran out from the crevice--scratched the bark\r\noutside with teeth and claws--and then hurriedly disappeared again.\r\n\r\n\"These strange manoeuvres were kept up for several minutes, while we all\r\nremained upon the shore, watching with curiosity for the result.\r\n\r\n\"At length, we saw the piece of bark move rapidly outward from the\r\ntrunk, and hang down suspended only by a few fibres.  These were soon\r\ngnawed by the teeth of the squirrel, and the broad scale fell into the\r\nwater.  It had hardly touched the surface, when the animal ran nimbly\r\ndown, and leaped upon it!  There was no current at the spot where the\r\nbark fell into the water; and we were in doubt whether it would carry\r\nhim out from among the trees; but we were soon convinced that our\r\nsquirrel knew what he was about.  As soon as he had fairly balanced\r\nhimself upon his tiny craft, he hoisted his broad bushy tail high up in\r\nthe air, by way of a sail; and, the next moment, we saw that the breeze\r\ncatching upon it wafted the little mariner slowly, but surely, outward!\r\nIn a few seconds he had cleared the trees; and the wind soon brought him\r\nwithin the influence of the current, which caused his bark to float\r\ndownward after his companions.\r\n\r\n\"These had well-nigh reached the breastwork of the dam; and Harry wished\r\nvery much to intercept them as they got to land.  This wish, however,\r\nwas overruled by his mother, who very justly declared that the little\r\ncreatures deserved to escape, after having so well amused us by their\r\ningenuity.\r\n\r\n\"In a short time, they all leaped ashore, and went scampering off among\r\nthe trees in search of a dinner--for by this time, no doubt, they were\r\nsufficiently hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nA HOUSE BUILT WITHOUT A NAIL.\r\n\r\n\"Next day Cudjo and I went on with our housebuilding.  This day was\r\nappropriated to roofing it.  We first laid a row of the clap-boards,\r\nprojecting considerably over the eaves--so as to cast the water far out.\r\nThese we secured near their lower ends by a long straight pole, which\r\ntraversed the roof horizontally from gable to gable, and was lashed down\r\nby strips of wet elk-hide.  These we knew would tighten as they dried,\r\nand press the pole firmer than ever against the boards.\r\n\r\n\"We now laid a second row of the clap-boards--with their lower ends\r\nriding the upper ones of the first row, and thus securing them.  The\r\nsecond row was in its turn secured by a horizontal pole, along its\r\nbottom, and at its top by the lower ends of the third row; and so on up\r\nto the ridge.\r\n\r\n\"The other side was shingled in a similar manner; and the ridge itself\r\nwas secured against leakage, by allowing the clap-boards, on one side,\r\nto project upwards, and shelter the ends of those on the other.  This\r\ngave our cabin quite a chanticleer sort of comb along its top, and added\r\nto the picturesqueness of its appearance.\r\n\r\n\"Our house was now built and roofed, and we could say that we had\r\nfinished a house without ever having been inside of it--for as yet it\r\nhad neither door nor windows.  As the spaces between the logs were not\r\nyet `chinked,' it looked more like a gigantic cage than a house.\r\n\r\n\"Our next day was devoted to making the door and window--that is, making\r\nthe apertures where these were to be.  We designed having only one\r\nwindow--in the back.\r\n\r\n\"The manner in which we opened our doorway was very simple.  Having\r\nfirst carefully rested the logs--which were to be on each side of the\r\ndoor--upon firm wedges, we sawed away the parts between.  Fortunately,\r\nwe had a saw, or this operation would have given us a good deal of\r\ntrouble.  Of course, we sawed away the proper size for a door; and thus\r\nour doorway, by placing the lintels and posts, was complete.  In a\r\nsimilar manner we cut out our window in the back.  We then went to work\r\nupon one of the soft tulip-trees, and sawed out enough plank to make a\r\ndoor and window, or rather a window-shutter.  These we cut to the proper\r\nsize, and bound them together by slats, and trenails made out of the\r\nhard locust-wood.  We then hung them--both door and window-shutter--with\r\nstrips of elk-skin.  That night we carried in all our bedding and\r\nutensils, and slept under the roof of our new house.\r\n\r\n\"It was still far from being finished; and the next day we set about\r\nbuilding a fireplace and chimney.  This, of course, was to be in one of\r\nthe gable ends; and we chose that looking northward--for we had built\r\nour cabin fronting the east.  We wedged the logs precisely as we had\r\ndone with the door, and then sawed away the space between--up to the\r\nheight of an ordinary mantel-piece.  Behind this, and altogether outside\r\nthe house, we built a fireplace of stones and clay--laying a hearth of\r\nthe same materials, that completely covered the sleeper--in order to\r\nprevent the latter from being burned.  On the top of this fireplace, the\r\nchimney was still to be erected; and this was done by notching short\r\nstraight pieces of timber, and placing them across each other, exactly\r\nas we had laid the logs of the house itself.  These pieces were put in\r\nshorter, as we advanced to the top--so that the top ones might be\r\nlighter and more easily supported by those below; and when the whole was\r\nfinished, and the chinks filled with clay, our chimney tapered upward\r\nlike the funnel of a little factory.  The chimney and fireplace occupied\r\nus quite a day, and at night--although it was not very cold--we tried it\r\nwith a log-fire.  It drew beautifully.\r\n\r\n\"Next day we `chinked' the walls all round with chips, stones, and clay.\r\nWe chinked gables and all, until not a hole was to be seen that would\r\nlet a mouse through.  The floor still remained; but we intended to lay\r\nthis with plank, and as we had no means of getting them except by our\r\nsmall saw, and they would require some time to dry, we resolved to\r\nattend, first, to several other things that were of more necessity, and\r\nfinish the floor at our leisure.  We carpeted the ground, which was\r\nquite dry, with green palmetto leaves, and that rendered it sufficiently\r\ncomfortable for the present.  We now formally entered our new house,\r\nwhich we had built from floor to chimney _without a nail_!\r\n\r\n\"Our next care was to furnish our horse with a house--in other words, to\r\nbuild a stable.  Not that the weather rendered it at all necessary for\r\nPompo--so our horse was called--to sleep under a roof; but we were\r\nfearful lest some beast of prey, prowling about by night, should fancy\r\nhim--as the carcajou had fancied our poor ox.\r\n\r\n\"The stable was only a two days' job--as we built it out of logs already\r\ncut, and roofed it with the refuse of our clap-boards.  Besides, we had\r\nno window nor chimney to make, and we did not chink the logs, as that\r\nwas not necessary for a stable in such a climate.  Our horse would be\r\nwarm enough without that; and Cudjo had made him a trough by hollowing\r\nout one of the tulip-trees.\r\n\r\n\"From that time forth Pompo was regularly called every evening at\r\nsunset, and shut up in his stable.  We could not afford to let the\r\ncarcajou make a meal of him, as in our log-hauling and other labours he\r\nwas of great service to us.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the stable was finished, we set to work and put up a table\r\nand six strong chairs.  As I have said, we had no nails; but,\r\nfortunately enough, I had both a chisel and auger, with several other\r\nuseful tools.  All of these I had brought in the great chest from\r\nVirginia, thinking they might be needed on our beautiful farm at Cairo.\r\nWith the help of these, and Cudjo's great skill as a joiner, we were\r\nable to mortise and dovetail at our pleasure; and I had made a most\r\nexcellent glue from the horns and hoofs of the elk and ox.  We wanted a\r\nplane to polish our table, but this was a want which we could easily\r\nendure.  The lid of our table was made of plank sawn out of the\r\ncatalpa-tree; and with some pieces of pumice I had picked up in the\r\nvalley, and the constant scouring which it received at the hands of our\r\nhousewife, it soon exhibited a surface as smooth as glass.  From my\r\nfinding this pumice-stone, I concluded that our snow-mountain had once\r\nbeen a volcano--perhaps like the peak of Teneriffe, standing alone in\r\nthe water, when the great plain around us had been covered with a sea.\r\n\r\n\"Cudjo and I did not forget the promise we had made to the beavers.  We\r\ncould see these little creatures, from day to day, very busy in drawing\r\nlarge branches to the water, and then floating them towards their\r\nhouses.  We knew that this was for their winter provisions.  They had\r\ngrown quite tame, as soon as they found we were not going to molest\r\nthem; and frequently came out on our side of the lake.  For this\r\nconfidence on their part we were determined to give them a treat they\r\nlittle dreamt of--at least, of receiving from our hands.\r\n\r\n\"I had noticed a clump of beautiful trees, which grew near one side of\r\nthe glade, and not far from where we had built our house.  Our attention\r\nhad been called to them by the aromatic fragrance of their flowers, that\r\nblew around us all the time we were engaged in building.  They were low,\r\ncrooked trees, not over thirty feet in height--with oval leaves, six\r\ninches in length, and of a bluish-green colour.  The flowers were about\r\nthe size of a rose, although more like a lily in appearance, and white\r\nas snow.  Their perfume was extremely agreeable, and Mary was in the\r\nhabit of gathering a bunch of them daily, and placing them in a vessel\r\nof water.\r\n\r\n\"I have already said that my wife understood botany, and all botanists\r\ntake a pleasure in imparting their knowledge to others.  She explained\r\nto us, therefore, the nature and properties of this sweet-scented tree.\r\nIt was a species of magnolia--not that which is celebrated for its large\r\nflowers, but another kind.  It was the _magnolia glauca_, sometimes\r\ncalled `swamp sassafras,' but more generally known among hunters and\r\ntrappers as the `beaver-tree.'  It is so named by them, because the\r\nbeaver is fonder of its roots than of any other food; so fond of it,\r\nindeed, that it is often used as a bait to the traps by which these\r\nanimals are caught.\r\n\r\n\"Whether our beavers had already discovered their favourite tree in some\r\nother part of the valley, we did not know.  Probably they had; but, at\r\nall events, Cudjo and I by a very little labour, with our spade and axe,\r\ncould save them a great deal; and so we set about it.\r\n\r\n\"In a few hours we dug up several armfuls of the long branching roots,\r\nand carried them down to the edge of the lake.  We flung them into the\r\nwater at a place where we knew the animals were in the habit of\r\nfrequenting.  In a short time the aromatic roots were discovered, when a\r\nwhole crowd of beavers were seen hurrying to the spot, and swimming off\r\nagain to their houses, each with a root or a whole bunch of them in his\r\nteeth.  That was a grand festival for the beavers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nA BATTUE OF \"BLACK-TAILS.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we could do nothing more for our beavers at present.  It was\r\nnot our intention to trap any of them until they should become very\r\nnumerous, and then we could obtain annually a large number of skins.\r\nTheir tails, we knew, were very good to eat--in fact, quite a delicacy--\r\nbut we could not afford to kill one of them merely for the sake of\r\neating his tail; and the other parts of the beaver's flesh are by no\r\nmeans palatable.  Besides, we expected to find enough of game without\r\nthat, as in every part, where the ground was soft, we saw the tracks of\r\ndeer and other animals.\r\n\r\n\"By the time we had fairly furnished our house, the flesh of the elk was\r\nbeginning to run short, so that a grand hunting excursion was determined\r\nupon.  It was also to be an exploring expedition, as up to this time we\r\nhad not visited any part of the valley except that which lay immediately\r\naround our house.  Frank, Harry, and myself, were to form the party,\r\nwhile Cudjo was to remain by the house, and guard the female portion of\r\nour little community with his great spear.\r\n\r\n\"Everything being ready, we started out with our three rifles, and took\r\nthe route up the valley.  As we passed along under high trees, we could\r\nsee squirrels upon all sides of us; some of them sitting on their\r\nhind-quarters like little monkeys; some of them cracking nuts; some of\r\nthem barking like toy-dogs; while others, again, leaped about among the\r\nbranches.  As we advanced upon them, they sprang up the trees, or\r\nstreaked off along the ground so swiftly that it seemed more like the\r\nflight of a bird than the running of a four-footed animal.  On reaching\r\na tree they would gallop up it, generally keeping on the opposite side\r\nto that on which we were, so that they might be secure.  Sometimes,\r\nhowever, their curiosity would get the better of their fears, and when\r\nthey had climbed as high as the first or second forking or the branches,\r\nthey would stop there and gaze down upon us, all the while flourishing\r\ntheir light bushy tails.  We had excellent opportunities of getting a\r\nshot at them, and Harry, who was not so thoughtful as his brother,\r\nwished very much to try his skill; but I forbade this, telling him that\r\nwe could not afford to throw away our ammunition on such small game.\r\nIndeed, this was a thought that frequently entered my mind, and made me\r\nanxious about what we should do when our ammunition became exhausted.  I\r\ncautioned both my boys, therefore, not to spend a single shot on any\r\nanimal smaller than elk or deer, and they promised to obey me.\r\n\r\n\"When we had gone about a mile up-stream, we saw that the trees grew\r\nthinner as we advanced, and then opened into small glades, or spaces\r\ncovered with herbage and flowers, usually called `openings.'  This,\r\nsurely, was the very place to find deer--much more likely than in the\r\nthick woods, where these animals are in more danger from the cougar and\r\ncarcajou, that occasionally drop upon them from the trees.  We had not\r\ngone far among these openings, before we saw fresh tracks.  They were\r\nmore like the tracks of a goat than those of a deer, except that they\r\nwere much larger.  They were nearly as large as the tracks of the elk,\r\nbut we knew they were not these.\r\n\r\n\"We advanced with great caution, keeping in the underwood as much as\r\npossible.  At length we saw that there was a large glade before us, much\r\nlarger than any we had yet passed.  We could tell this by the wide clear\r\nspaces that appeared through the trees.  We stole silently forward to\r\nthe edge of this glade, and, to our great satisfaction, saw a herd of\r\ndeer feeding quietly out upon the open ground.\r\n\r\n\"`Papa, they are not deer,' said Frank, as we first came in sight of\r\nthem.  `See! who ever heard of deer with such ears as those?  I declare\r\nthey are as long as a mule's!'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes,' added Harry; `and who ever heard of deer with black-tails?'\r\n\r\n\"I confess I was myself puzzled for a while.  The animals before us were\r\ncertainly deer, as their long slender legs and great branched antlers\r\ntestified; but they were very different from the common kind--and\r\ndifferent, too, from the elk.  They were much larger than the red or\r\nfallow-deer, though not unlike them in shape and colour.  But that which\r\nwas strange, as my boys had at once noticed, was the peculiarity of\r\ntheir ears and tails.  The former were quite as long as the ears of a\r\nmule, and reached more that half-way to the tops of their antlers.\r\nTheir tails, again, were short and bushy, of a whitish colour\r\nunderneath, but on the top and above as black as the wing of a crow.\r\nThere were also some black hairs upon their backs, and a black stripe\r\nalong the neck and shoulders, while their noses on each side were of a\r\npale ashy colour--all of which marks gave them a very different\r\nappearance from the Virginian or English deer.\r\n\r\n\"I have said that I was at first puzzled; but I soon recollected having\r\nheard of these animals, although they are but little known to\r\nnaturalists.  They could be no other than the `black-tailed deer' of the\r\nRocky Mountains--the _cervus macrotis_ described by the naturalist Say.\r\nThis was evident, both from their size, the great length of their ears--\r\nbut more than all from the colour of their tails, from which last\r\ncircumstance their common name has been given them by the hunters and\r\ntrappers.\r\n\r\n\"We did not stop long to examine them.  We were too anxious to have a\r\nshot at them; but how were we to get near enough?  There were seven of\r\nthem in the herd; but they were quite out in the middle of the glade,\r\nand that was more than three hundred yards wide.  The nearest of the\r\nseven was beyond the range even of my long rifle.  What, then, was best\r\nto be done?\r\n\r\n\"After thinking about this for a moment, I saw that an open passage led\r\nout of the glade through the trees on the other side.  It was a wide\r\navenue leading into some other glade; and I knew that the deer when\r\nstartled would be most likely to make off in that direction.  I\r\ndetermined, therefore, to creep round to the other side, and intercept\r\nthem as they attempted to run through.  Frank was to remain where we\r\nfirst saw them, while Harry would go half-way along with me, and then\r\ntake his stand behind a tree.  We should thus enclose the deer in a sort\r\nof triangle, and some one of us would be sure of getting them within\r\nrange before they could escape.\r\n\r\n\"I had scarcely got to the edge of the opening when I saw that the herd\r\nwas browsing in towards Frank.  They were every moment getting closer\r\nand closer to him, and I watched eagerly for the shot.  I knew he would\r\nnot fire until they were very near, as I had cautioned him not to do so,\r\non account of the smallness of his rifle.  Presently I saw the stream of\r\nsmoke and fire issuing from the leaves; then followed the sharp crack,\r\nand then the yelping of our dogs as they broke forward.  At the same\r\ntime one of the deer was seen to spring upward and fall dead in its\r\ntracks.  The others wheeled and ran, first one way and then another, in\r\ntheir confusion; until, after doubling several times, they made towards\r\nthe opening where I stood.  In their flight, however, they had gone too\r\nclose to Harry, and as they were running past his stand, the tiny crack\r\nof a rifle was heard among the bushes; and another of the black-tails\r\nrolled over on the plain.\r\n\r\n\"It was now my turn; and I prepared myself to make the best shot I could\r\nor be beaten by my own boys.  So as they came up I let drive at them, to\r\nmy mortification missing them every one--as I thought at the moment.  It\r\nsoon appeared, however, that I was mistaken in this.  Castor and Pollux\r\nswept past upon the heels of the herd; and before they had disappeared\r\nout of the long avenue, I saw the dogs spring upon the haunches of one\r\nthat lagged behind, and drag him to the ground.  I ran to their\r\nassistance, and seizing the wounded animal by one of its antlers, soon\r\nput an end to it with my knife.  I had wounded it in the flank; and that\r\nhad enabled the mastiffs to overtake it, which they could not have done\r\notherwise, as its companions were at the time several hundred yards\r\nahead of it.  We all now came together, exulting in the fine fortune we\r\nhad met with, for we had made a regular _battue_ of it.  We were glad\r\nthat none of us had missed, and that we had succeeded in obtaining so\r\nmuch good meat, for we were not slaughtering these beautiful creatures\r\nout of wanton sport, but from the necessity of procuring food.  Each\r\ncongratulated the others upon their good shooting, and said nothing of\r\nhis own--although it was plain that all three of us were proud of our\r\nrespective shots.  To do justice, however, that of Harry was decidedly\r\nthe best.  He had knocked his one over while on the run--no easy matter\r\nwith these black-tails, who do not gallop regularly as other deer, but\r\nbound forward, lifting all their feet together, as you will sometimes\r\nsee sheep do.  This mode of running is one of the peculiarities of their\r\nspecies--which, perhaps, more than any other thing, distinguishes them\r\nfrom the common deer.\r\n\r\n\"After carefully wiping out, and then reloading, our rifles, we rested\r\nthem against the trees, and set to work to skin our game.\r\n\r\n\"While engaged in this operation, Harry complained of thirst.  Indeed,\r\nwe were all thirsty as well, for the sun was hot, and we had walked a\r\ngood distance.  We could not be far from the stream, although we were\r\nnot sure of its direction; and Harry, taking the tin cup which we had\r\nbrought with us, set out to find it, promising soon to return with water\r\nfor our relief.  He had only left us but a short while, when we heard\r\nhim calling back through the trees; and, thinking that some animal might\r\nhave attacked him, Frank and I seized our rifles, and ran after him.  On\r\ncoming up, we were surprised to find him standing quietly on the bank of\r\na crystal rivulet, holding the cup=full of water in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"`Why did you bring us away?' asked Frank.\r\n\r\n\"`Taste this,' replied he; `here's a pickle!'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh, papa!' cried Frank, after applying the cup to his lips; `salt as\r\nbrine, I declare.'\r\n\r\n\"`Salt you may say,' continued his brother; `the sea itself is not so\r\nsalt--taste it, papa!'\r\n\r\n\"I did as I was desired; and, to my delight, I found that the water of\r\nthe rivulet was, what Frank had alleged, `salt as brine.'  I say to my\r\ndelight, for I was greatly pleased at this discovery.  The boys could\r\nnot understand this, as they, being now very thirsty, would much rather\r\nhave met with a cup of fresh, than a whole river of salt water.  I soon\r\npointed out to them the importance of what we had found.  We had\r\nhitherto been in great need of salt--for we had not a single grain of\r\nit--and had felt the want ever since our arrival in the valley.  Only\r\nthey who cannot get salt, can understand what a terrible thing it is to\r\nbe without this homely, but necessary article.\r\n\r\n\"The flesh of our elk, which for many days past we lived upon, had\r\nproved quite insipid for want of salt; and we had not been able to make\r\na soup that was in any way palatable.  Now, however, we should have as\r\nmuch as we desired; and I explained to my companions, that by simply\r\nboiling this water in our kettle, we should obtain the very thing we so\r\nmuch stood in need of.  This, as they saw, would be great news for mamma\r\non our return; and the prospect of making her happy, by imparting the\r\ninformation, rendered all of us impatient to get back.  We did not stay\r\na moment by the salt stream--which was a very small rivulet of blue\r\nwater, and evidently ran from some spring that bubbled up in the valley.\r\nNot far below us, we saw where it emptied itself into the main stream\r\nof fresh water; and, keeping down to the latter, we quenched our thirst,\r\nand then went back to our work.\r\n\r\n\"We made all the haste we could; and our three black-tails were soon\r\nskinned, quartered, and hung upon the trees--so as to be out of reach of\r\nthe wolves while we should be gone.  We then shouldered our rifles, and\r\nhurried back to the house.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nCATCHING A TARTAR.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, Mary was much pleased at hearing of the discovery we had\r\nmade.  One of the first requisites of a housewife is a supply of good\r\nsalt; and that we promised to obtain for her on the morrow.  It was our\r\nintention to carry the kettle up to the salt stream, and there\r\nmanufacture the article--as that would be more convenient than to bring\r\nthe water down to the house.  This piece of work we laid out for the\r\nnext day.  Meanwhile, as it was not yet near night, we caught Pompo, and\r\nset off again to bring home our black-tails.  This required us to make\r\nseveral journeys--as we had no cart by which we could bring the deer all\r\nat once, and each of them was as large as a good-sized heifer.  We\r\nsucceeded, however, in getting all to the house before sunset--except\r\nthe skins, which we left hanging on the trees for another day.  While\r\nthe boys and I had been engaged at this work, Cudjo was not idle.  It\r\nwas our intention to cure the venison--not by `jerking,' as we had done\r\nthe elk-meat, but with the salt, which we were about to make on the\r\nmorrow.  For this purpose, we should require a large vessel capable of\r\nholding the pickle.  We had nothing of the sort; and, of course, we were\r\npuzzled for a while as to how we should manage without it.  It was early\r\nin the day--before we had brought in the venison--that this difficulty\r\noccurred to us.\r\n\r\n\"`Why could we not leave it in the stream itself?' asked Harry.  `The\r\nwater is very clear, and there are clean hard rocks on the bottom.  Why\r\ncould we not sink the quarters of venison on these rocks, and make them\r\nfast, by placing great stones on them?'\r\n\r\n\"`Ha, ha!' laughed Frank, `trust the wolves for finding them there.\r\nThese gentry would soon empty your famous pickle barrel.'\r\n\r\n\"`Look yar, Massa,' said Cudjo; `this nigga sees no difficulty 'bout\r\ndat.  He soon make a place for de meat.'\r\n\r\n\"`How, Cudjo?' inquired Mary.\r\n\r\n\"`Why, Missa, same's dey make de ole dug-out in Vaginny--by hollering\r\nout de log.'\r\n\r\n\"This was the very thing itself.  A log hollowed out after the manner of\r\na canoe, or `dug-out,'--as Cudjo used to designate that species of\r\ncraft--would answer the purpose admirably; and Cudjo, having chosen a\r\nsection of a large tulip-tree, went to work.  By the time we had got our\r\nlast load to the house, he had made a cavity in the tree, that was\r\ncapable of containing the three black-tails at once.  A valuable idea\r\nwas also suggested by this operation.  We remembered the wooden trays,\r\ndishes, and other utensils--made in this way--that we had often seen\r\namong the negroes on our plantation.  These, however rude, we saw\r\nanswered the purpose well; and we might hereafter supply ourselves in a\r\nsimilar manner.\r\n\r\n\"After breakfast the next morning, we started for the salt stream.  We\r\nall went together, Mary riding the horse, while Cudjo and I carried the\r\nchildren in our arms.  Frank and Harry took the kettle upon a long pole\r\nbetween them--each, at the same time, having his rifle in the other\r\nhand.  The dogs of course followed us, and our house was left to take\r\ncare of itself.  We had hung the venison up on high branches, lest the\r\nwolves might take a fancy to it in our absence.\r\n\r\n\"Mary was charmed with the scenery as we passed along, particularly\r\nwhere the woods began to open, as they did, towards the upper end of the\r\nvalley.  She noticed the various kind of trees as we advanced, and at\r\none time uttered a joyous exclamation, as though she had seen something\r\nthat pleased her more than common.\r\n\r\n\"We questioned her as to what it was; but she would satisfy us no\r\nfarther than by telling us, that she had made a discovery of nearly as\r\nmuch importance as our salt river.  We were curious to know what it was,\r\nbut my wife checked our curiosity by observing, very justly, that as we\r\nwere happy enough at that time, she might make us too happy; and she\r\nshould therefore reserve her secret until we got back to our house in\r\nthe evening.  `We may then be weary and out of spirits,' added she, `but\r\nI have something to tell you that will make you all merry again.'\r\n\r\n\"I could not help admiring the good sense and patience of my wife, thus\r\nreserving pleasant news for a time when they might be more available in\r\nproducing a happy effect.\r\n\r\n\"As we were marching through a small glade, talking and laughing in high\r\nglee, an animal leaped out of some bushes before us, and ran slowly off\r\nto one side.  It was a beautiful little creature, about the size of a\r\ncat, with dark glossy hair, spotted about the head and neck, and with\r\nclear white stripes running along its back.  It did not go far before it\r\nstopped; and, throwing up its long bushy tail, looked back at us with\r\nthe playful and innocent air of a kitten.  I knew very well what the\r\npretty creature was.  Not so the impetuous Harry, who, thinking that\r\nhere was the very `pet' he wanted, dropped his pole, kettle, and all,\r\nand made after it.\r\n\r\n\"I cried out to him to desist; but the boy, either not hearing me--on\r\naccount of the yelping of the dogs, who had also started in pursuit--or\r\nbeing too intent on making a capture, ran on after the animal.  But the\r\nchase did not last long.  The little creature, apparently not the least\r\nfrightened at the terrible enemies that were so close upon its heels--\r\nstood near the edge of the glade, as if to await its pursuers Harry, as\r\nhe ran, was all the while eagerly scolding off the dogs.  He wanted to\r\ntake the little beauty alive; and he feared that the mastiffs would kill\r\nit before he could come up.  It looked, too, as if they would, for they\r\nwere now almost on top of it yelping with open mouths.  Just at this\r\nmoment, the strange animal was seen to elevate its hind-quarters, throw\r\nits long tail forward over its back, and give a sudden jerk of its body,\r\nas if by way of an insult to its pursuers.  But it meant something more\r\nthan a mere insult.  It meant to punish them for their audacity.  The\r\neffect of that singular movement was at once apparent.  The dogs\r\nsuddenly wheeled in their tracks.  Their victorious yelping was changed\r\nto a fearful howling; and both of them ran back thrusting their noses\r\ninto the grass, and capering over the ground as if they had either been\r\nstung by wasps, or had suddenly fallen into convulsions!  Harry stopped\r\nfor a moment wondering at this.  He did not stop long.  The next moment\r\nwe saw him throw his hands up to his face, and uttering a cry that\r\nbetokened pain and terror, come running back as quick as he had gone\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\"The pole-cat (for it was a pole-cat--the _mephitis chinga_, or American\r\nskunk) after he had discharged the fetid shower, stood for an instant\r\nlooking over his shoulder, in such a way that we could almost fancy he\r\nwas laughing.  Then jerking his tail from side to side in a frolicksome\r\nmanner, he made a bound into the bramble, and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Whether the skunk laughed or not, _we_ did--especially Frank, who took\r\nthis method of retaliating upon his brother for dropping the great\r\nkettle against his shins.  But we had no time to lose in talk, until we\r\ncould get some distance from the glade, which was now filled with the\r\nsuffocating smell; so, calling upon Harry to lay hold of his burden, we\r\nhurried as quickly as possible from the spot.  The dogs, however,\r\nbrought the effluvium along with them; and it required unusual scolding\r\nand pelting of stones to keep them at a respectful distance.  Harry had\r\ncome off better than I expected--as the animal had directed its battery\r\nagainst the dogs; and he had only received enough of the discharge to\r\npunish him for his rashness and disobedience.\r\n\r\n\"As we continued our journey, I took the opportunity to instruct my\r\nchildren in the habits of this singular animal.\r\n\r\n\"`You have seen,' said I, addressing myself to Frank and Harry, `that it\r\nis about the size of a cat, although broader and fleshier in the body,\r\nlower upon the limbs, and with a sharper and more elongated snout.\r\n\r\n\"`You have seen that it is a spotted and striped animal--and in this\r\nrespect it also resembles the cat, as these spots and stripes are\r\ndifferent upon different individuals of the same species--so much so\r\nthat no two skunks are exactly alike in colour.\r\n\r\n\"`You have witnessed the efficient means with which Nature has armed it\r\nagainst its enemies; and I shall now tell you all the rest that is known\r\nof its habits.\r\n\r\n\"`It is a _carnivorous_ creature--destroying and eating many other\r\nbeings that have life as well as itself.  For this purpose it is\r\nfurnished with strong, sharp claws, and three kinds of teeth, one of\r\nwhich--termed canine, or tearing teeth--is a certain symptom of its\r\nbeing a carnivorous, or flesh-eating animal.  You must know, that the\r\nshape of the teeth will always prove this.  Animals that feed upon\r\nvegetables, such as horses, sheep, rabbits, and deer, have none of these\r\ncanine teeth.  Well, the skunk has four of them--two in each jaw, and\r\nvery sharp ones, too,--and with these he kills and eats (whenever he is\r\nlucky enough to get hold of them) rabbits, poultry, birds, mice, frogs,\r\nand lizards.  He is very fond of eggs, too; and frequently robs the\r\nfarm-yard, and the nests of the ruffed grouse and wild turkey--killing\r\nthese birds whenever he can catch them.  The killing, however, is not\r\nall upon his side--as the wolf, the horned owl, the wolverene, and the\r\nfarmer, in their turn, lull _him_ whenever they can catch him.  He is\r\nnot by any means a fast runner, and his safety does not lie in his\r\nswiftness of foot.  His defensive armour is found in the fetid effluvium\r\nwhich, by a muscular exertion, he is capable of ejecting upon his\r\npursuer.  This he carries in two small _sacs_ that lie under his tail,\r\nwith ducts leading outward about as large as the tube of a goose-quill.\r\nThe effluvium itself is caused by a thin fluid, which cannot be seen in\r\ndaylight, but at night appears, when ejected, like a double stream of\r\nphosphoric light.  He can throw it to the distance of five yards; and,\r\nknowing this, he always waits till the pursuer has fairly got within\r\nrange--as the one we have just seen did with Castor and Pollux.  The\r\ndischarge of this fluid rarely fails to drive off such enemies as\r\nwolves, dogs, and men.  Sometimes it occasions sickness and vomiting;\r\nand it is said that there are Indians who have lost their eyesight from\r\ninflammation caused by it.  Dogs are frequently swollen and inflamed for\r\nweeks, after having received the discharge of a skunk.  In addition to\r\nthe disagreeableness of this odour, there is no getting rid of it after\r\nthe fluid has once been sprinkled over your garments.  Clothes may be\r\nwashed and buried for months, but it will still cling to them; and where\r\na skunk has been, killed, the spot will retain the scent for many months\r\nafter, even though deep snow may have been lying upon it.\r\n\r\n\"`It is only when attacked or angered that the animal sends forth his\r\noffensive fluid; and when killed suddenly, or before he has had time to\r\n\"fire it off,\" nothing of the kind is perceived upon his carcass.\r\n\r\n\"`The skunk is a burrowing animal, and in cold countries he enters his\r\nhole, and sleeps in a half-torpid state throughout the winter.  In warm\r\nclimates, however, he continues to prowl about all the year round,\r\ngenerally at night--as, like most predatory creatures, the night is his\r\nday.  In his burrow, which runs several yards underground, he lives, in\r\ncompany with ten or a dozen of his companions.  The female has a nest in\r\none part, made of grass and leaves, where she brings forth her young--\r\nhaving from five to nine kittens at a birth.\r\n\r\n\"`Strange as it may appear, the Indians, as well as many white men--\r\nhunters and others--eat the flesh of this animal, and pronounce it both\r\nsavoury and agreeable--equal, as they allege, to the finest roast pig.\r\nSo much for the skunk and his habits.  Now to the making of our salt.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE SALT SPRING.\r\n\r\n\"We had now arrived on the banks of the salt creek; but as we saw the\r\ncliff close by, and knew that we must be near the spring which supplied\r\nthis little rivulet, we resolved to travel on to the fountain-head.  A\r\nfew hundred yards farther brought us to the spring, and it was well\r\nworth travelling a little farther to see.\r\n\r\n\"Near the bottom of the cliff were several round objects, looking like\r\nhalf globes, or bowls turned upon their mouths.  They were of a whitish\r\ncolour, resembling white quartz rock; and of all sizes, from that of a\r\nlarge baking oven to the size of a wooden dish.  In the top of each\r\nthere was a round cavity--like a little crater of a volcano--and in this\r\nthe blue water bubbled and boiled as though a hot fire was in the ground\r\nunderneath them.  There were in all nearly twenty of these, but many of\r\nthem were without the crater-like cavity in the top; and through the\r\nlatter, of course, no water escaped to the creek.  These were old ones,\r\nthat had ceased to run.\r\n\r\n\"It was evident that these oven-looking mounds had been formed by the\r\nwater itself, which had been depositing the sediment that formed them\r\nfor many, many years.  Around some of them there grew beautiful plants\r\nand shrubs, whose leaves and flowers hung over, trailing in the water;\r\nand from the cliff above long vines crept out, covered with gay scarlet\r\nblossoms.  Bushes of wild currants grew all around, and the fragrance of\r\ntheir leaves scented the air.  It was altogether a sweet, cool spot, and\r\nfilled us with feelings of enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\"After we had satisfied our curiosity in examining these objects, we\r\nprepared to make our salt.  Frank and Harry collected armfuls of dry\r\nwood for the fire, while Cudjo erected a crane in his usual fashion.\r\nUpon this the kettle was suspended, and filled with crystal water out of\r\none of the natural basins.  The fire soon blazed under it, and we had\r\nnothing more to do than wait until the evaporation should be completed\r\nby boiling.\r\n\r\n\"For this purpose we chose a spot where the ground was carpeted with a\r\nsoft green turf; and upon it we all sat down to wait the result.\r\n\r\n\"I need not say that in this we had a deep interest, amounting, in\r\ntruth, to anxiety.  It might not be salt after all.  The water tasted\r\nsalt--that is true.  But so, too, would water impregnated by the\r\nsulphate of magnesia or the sulphate of soda.  When evaporated we might\r\nfind one or other of these substances.\r\n\r\n\"`What is the sulphate of magnesia, papa?' inquired Frank.\r\n\r\n\"`Perhaps you would know it better by the name of Epsom salts!' rejoined\r\nhis mother, with a knowing smile.\r\n\r\n\"`Bah!' returned he, with a grin upon his face, `I hope it won't turn\r\nout that.  But what sort of thing, then, is the sulphate of soda?'\r\n\r\n\"`That is the scientific name for Glauber's salts.'\r\n\r\n\"`Worse still!  I don't think we stand in need of either.  Do we,\r\nHarry?'\r\n\r\n\"`Not a bit of it,' responded Harry, also grinning at the thought of\r\nthese well-known specifics.  `I would rather it should turn out\r\nsaltpetre and sulphur.  Then we could make lots of gunpowder.'\r\n\r\n\"Harry was a great shot--as we have seen--and one of his fears was, that\r\nour stock of powder would run out.\r\n\r\n\"`Do not wish for that, Harry,' said his mother.  `Gunpowder we can do\r\nvery well without.  Let us hope for something more necessary to us at\r\npresent.'\r\n\r\n\"With such-like conversation we passed the time, while we watched the\r\nsteaming kettle with feelings of anxious expectation.\r\n\r\n\"For myself, I had some reliance upon a fact which I had observed years\r\nbefore, and had regarded as singular.  It was this.  I believe the\r\nCreator has so disposed it, that salt, so essential to animal life, is\r\nto be found in all parts of the globe, either in rocks, springs,\r\nstanding lakes, incrustations, or in the ocean itself.  No part of the\r\nearth, of great extent, is without it; and I had noticed in the interior\r\nterritories of the American continent--where the sea is too distant to\r\nbe visited by animals--that Nature has provided numerous salt springs,\r\nor `licks,' as they are termed in the language of the country.  These\r\nsprings from time immemorial have been the meeting-places of the wild\r\ncreatures of the forest and prairie, who resort thither to drink their\r\nwaters, or lick the saline soil through which these waters run.  Hence\r\ntheir common name of `licks.'  Here, then, was a valley whose\r\nfour-footed inhabitants never roamed beyond its borders.  I felt\r\nconfident that Nature had provided for their wants and cravings by\r\ngiving them everything necessary to their existence, and, among other\r\nnecessities, that one which we were now in search of ourselves--salt.\r\nIn other words, but that this was a salt spring, or there existed some\r\nother such in the valley, these creatures would not have been found\r\nwithin it.  I took the opportunity to point out this theory to my boys,\r\nas well as to show them--what I myself clearly recognised in it--the\r\nhand of the Creator.  It rendered them confident that, when we had\r\nevaporated our water, we should get salt for our pains.\r\n\r\n\"`Papa,' inquired Frank, who was a great naturalist, `I should like to\r\nknow what makes this little rivulet run salt water.'\r\n\r\n\"`No doubt,' I replied, `the water you see gushing forth has just been\r\npassing through vast beds or rock-salt, and has become impregnated with\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n\"`Rock-salt! and is the salt we use found in rocks?'\r\n\r\n\"`Not all of it, though great quantities are.  There are beds of\r\nrock-salt found in many countries--in England, and the East Indies, in\r\nRussia, and Hungary, and Spain; and it has also been discovered in vast\r\nquantities in this very Desert we are now dwelling in.  These beds of\r\nrock-salt, when worked to supply salt, are called salt-mines.  The most\r\ncelebrated are in Poland, near the city of Cracow.  These have been\r\nworked for seven hundred years; and there is enough left in them to\r\nsupply all the world for many centuries yet to come.  These mines are\r\nsaid to be very beautiful--lit up, as they are, by numerous lamps.  The\r\nrock has been excavated by the miners into all sorts of shapes.  Houses,\r\nchapels, columns, obelisks, and many other ornamental forms of\r\nbuildings, have been made; and these, when illuminated by lamps and\r\ntorches, appear as splendid and brilliant as the palaces of Aladdin.'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh!  I should like so much to see them!' cried Harry, in a transport.\r\n\r\n\"`But, papa,' inquired Frank, who always sought after information on\r\nsuch subjects, `I never saw any of this rock-salt.  How is it that it\r\ncomes to us always crushed, or in great bricks, as if it had been baked?\r\nDo they break it fine before it is sent to market from the mines?'\r\n\r\n\"`In some of these mines nothing more is required than to crush the\r\nrock; in others, however, the rock is not pure salt, but mixed with\r\nother substances, as oxide of iron and clay.  In these cases it is first\r\ndissolved in water, to separate it from such impurities, and then\r\nevaporated back again into salt, precisely as we are doing now.'\r\n\r\n\"`What colour is the salt-rock, papa?'\r\n\r\n\"`When pure it is white; but it assumes various colours, according to\r\nwhat substances may be found mixed with it.  It is often yellow, and\r\nflesh-coloured, and blue.'\r\n\r\n\"`How pretty it must be!' exclaimed Harry; `like precious stones, I\r\ndeclare.'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, it is a precious stone,' rejoined his brother; `more precious, I\r\ntake it, than all the diamonds in the world.  Is it not, papa?'\r\n\r\n\"`You are quite right,' I replied.  `Salt-rock is more valuable to the\r\nhuman race than diamonds; though they, too, have an _absolute_ value,\r\nbesides their value as a mere ornament.  There are some important uses\r\nin arts and manufactures to which they can be applied.'\r\n\r\n\"`But, papa,' again inquired Frank, determined to know everything he\r\ncould about the article of salt, `I have heard that salt is made of\r\nsea-water.  Is it so?'\r\n\r\n\"`Vast quantities of it.'\r\n\r\n\"`How is it made?'\r\n\r\n\"`There are three ways of obtaining it:--First, in warm climates, where\r\nthe sun is strong, the sea-water is collected into shallow pools, and\r\nthere left until it is evaporated by the sun's rays.  The ground where\r\nthese pools are made must neither be muddy nor porous, else the salt\r\nwould get mixed with the mud and sand.  Of course the people who\r\nmanufacture it in this way take care to choose firm, hard ground for the\r\nbottoms of their pools.  There are sluices attached to these pools by\r\nwhich any water that may not evaporate is drawn off.  Salt is made in\r\nthis manner in many southern countries--in Spain and Portugal, in\r\nFrance, and other countries that lie around the Mediterranean; also in\r\nIndia, China, Siam, and the island of Ceylon.\r\n\r\n\"`The second way of making salt from sea-water is precisely the same as\r\nthat I have described--except that, instead of these artificial pools,\r\nthe evaporation takes place in broad tracts of country over which the\r\nsea has spread in time of high springtides.  When the sea falls again to\r\nits proper level, it leaves behind it a quantity of water in these\r\ntracts, which is evaporated by the sun, leaving behind it fields of pure\r\nsalt.  Nothing remains to be done but to scrape this salt into heaps and\r\ncart it off; and at the next spring-tide a fresh influx of sea-water\r\nproduces a new crop of salt, and so on.  This kind is better than that\r\nwhich is made in the artificial pools--though neither of them is equal\r\nto the salt of the mines.  They are both known in commerce under the\r\nname of \"bay-salt,\" to distinguish them from the \"rock-salt\" of the\r\nmines.  Great natural beds of the bay-salt are found in the Cape de\r\nVerde islands; also in Turk's island and Saint Martin's in the West\r\nIndies, and on Kangaroo Island, near the coast of Australia.\r\n\r\n\"`There is still a third plan of making salt out of the sea.  That is,\r\nby boiling the water, as we are doing; but this makes the worst of all\r\nsalt; besides, it is far more expensive to manufacture salt in this way\r\nthan to buy it from other countries.  Indeed, this last plan would never\r\nbe adopted, were it not that some foolish governments force their people\r\nto pay a heavy duty for importing salt into their country, thus making\r\nit still cheaper for them, costly as it is, to manufacture the article\r\nat home.'\r\n\r\n\"`What makes the sea salt, papa?'\r\n\r\n\"`That is one of the phenomena about which naturalists have a difference\r\nof opinion.  Some of them say there are vast beds of salt at the bottom\r\nwhich keep the water always impregnated.  I think this notion is very\r\nchildish; and they who hold it offer only childish arguments to support\r\nit.  Others assert that the salt water of the ocean is a primitive\r\nfluid--that it was always as it now is--which you will perceive is\r\ngiving no reason at all, more than saying, \"it is salt, because it was\r\nsalt always.\"  This is an equally irrational theory.  Others, again,\r\nbelieve that the saltness of the ocean is caused by the flowing into it\r\nof salt rivers.  These, I think, hold the true opinion; but\r\nunfortunately they have failed, as far as I know, to answer the\r\nobjections which have been raised against it.  Your papa has reflected a\r\ngood deal upon this subject, and believes that he can explain away all\r\nthe difficulties that oppose this last theory.  Probably he may take an\r\nearly opportunity of doing so; but it will require more time than he can\r\nspare at present.'\r\n\r\n\"`Is the sea equally salt at all places?' inquired the philosopher\r\nFrank, after a short pause, during which he had been busily reflecting\r\non what had been said.\r\n\r\n\"`No; it is more so at the Equator than in the colder regions around the\r\nPoles.  It is less salt in gulfs and inland seas than in the open ocean.\r\nThis I believe I can also explain, because it would support the theory\r\nregarding the rivers of which we have just spoken.  The difference of\r\nsaltness in different parts of the sea is, however, very trifling.'\r\n\r\n\"`How much salt is there in the sea-water?'\r\n\r\n\"`Three and a half per cent nearly.  That is, if you boil down one\r\nhundred pounds of sea-water, it will yield you about three pounds and a\r\nhalf of salt.'\r\n\r\n\"`But are there not many lakes and brine-springs that contain a far\r\ngreater proportion than that?'\r\n\r\n\"`Many.  There is a large lake lying in this very Desert, to the\r\nnorth-west of where we are, called the \"Great Salt Lake.\"  The waters of\r\nthat lake are more than one-third pure salt.  There are many springs and\r\nrivers that contain a greater proportion than the ocean itself.  It is\r\nto be hoped that our own little creek here will yield better than it.--\r\nBut come! let us see how the kettle boils.  We had almost forgotten it.'\r\n\r\n\"We approached our kettle, and lifted the lid.  To our great joy, a scum\r\nwas floating on the top, very much like crystals of ice forming upon\r\nhalf melted snow.  Some of it was skimmed off and applied to our lips.\r\nJoy! it was _salt_--the pure _chloride of sodium_--equal to the best\r\never shipped from Turk's Island.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF THE SNAKES.\r\n\r\n\"I need not tell you that the announcement was received with joyful\r\nacclamations; and that one and all satisfied themselves by tasting of\r\nthe salt.  It had crystallised into small cubes, as salt always does;\r\nand it was as white as snow, which proved its great purity.  We had put\r\ninto the kettle--which was a large camp-kettle--about four gallons of\r\nwater, and when it was fully evaporated, we obtained not less than ten\r\npints of salt, showing that the water of our spring was much more saline\r\nthan the sea itself.\r\n\r\n\"When our first kettle-full was disposed of, we re-filled it with water,\r\nand again hung it over the fire.  We also hung another vessel beside the\r\nkettle; and that was our frying-pan, in which several fine steaks of\r\nvenison, seasoned with the new salt, were cooked for our dinner.  We\r\nwere not unmindful of the thanks which we owed to God for giving us this\r\nmunificent supply of an article so much needed by us; and as soon as\r\ndinner was over, my wife took occasion to bring this subject pointedly\r\nforward and we sat for some time conversing upon it.\r\n\r\n\"All at once we were interrupted by a series of curious incidents, which\r\ntook place within sight of our fire.  Our attention was first drawn to\r\nthem by hearing loud screams at a short distance from us, which we all\r\nrecognised as the voice of the blue-jay.  There is nothing unusual in\r\nhearing this bird screaming half the day--for it is, perhaps, more\r\neasily excited than any other feathered creature.  But, if you have ever\r\nnoticed, it utters a very peculiar cry when there's something unusual\r\n`in the wind.'  When some much-dreaded enemy is at hand, its note\r\nbecomes extremely shrill and disagreeable.  So it was then; and for that\r\nreason it drew my attention, as well as that of my companions.\r\n\r\n\"We looked towards the spot whence the cry came.  We could see the\r\nbranches of a low tree in motion, and the beautiful sky-blue wings of\r\nthe bird closing and spreading again as it fluttered through them.  We\r\ncould see nothing else upon the tree--that is, no enemy of the bird--nor\r\non any of the trees near it.  On lowering our eyes to the ground,\r\nhowever, we perceived at once what had set the jay to scolding.  Slowly\r\ndrawing itself along the earth, gliding through the grass and over the\r\ndry leaves--without causing even the driest of them to rustle--went a\r\nhideous reptile--a snake.  Its yellowish body, dappled with black\r\nblotches, glittered as the sun glanced from its lubricated scales; while\r\nit rose and fell in wavy undulations as it moved.  It moved slowly--by\r\nvertical sinuosities, almost in a direct line, with its head slightly\r\nraised from the grass.  At intervals, it stopped--elevated its neck--\r\nlowered its flat coffin-shaped head, like a feeding swan--gently\r\noscillated it in a horizontal direction--touched the crisp leaves with\r\nits red tongue, as though it was _feeling for a trail_--and then moved\r\non again.  In its frequent pauses, as it lay stretched along the ground\r\nit appeared cylindrical, as long as the tallest man, and as thick as a\r\nman's fore-arm.  Its tail ended in a horny appendage about a foot in\r\nlength, and resembling a string of large yellowish ill-shaped beads, or\r\na portion of its own vertebrae stripped of the flesh, this peculiarity\r\ntold us its species.  We saw before us the dreaded rattlesnake--the\r\n_crotalus horridus_.\r\n\r\n\"My companions were eager to rush forward and at once attack the\r\nmonster.  I restrained them, dogs and all.  I had heard--who has not?--\r\nof the power of fascination which these reptiles possess.  I knew not\r\nwhether to believe or disbelieve it.  Here was an opportunity to test\r\nits truth.  Would it charm the bird?  We should see.  One and all of us\r\nremained motionless and silent.  The snake crawled on.\r\n\r\n\"The bird followed over-head, pitching itself from branch to branch,\r\nfrom tree to tree, screaming with open throat.  Neither of them noticed\r\nus, as we were partially concealed where we sat.\r\n\r\n\"On reaching the foot of a tall magnolia, the rattlesnake--after going\r\nonce round the tree, and apparently smelling the bark--slowly and\r\ncarefully wound itself into a spiral coil, close in to the trunk.  Its\r\nbody now presented the appearance of a speckled and glittering cable, as\r\nthey are usually coiled on the deck of a ship.  The tail with its horny\r\nappendage protruded beneath, and the flat head peeped over above,\r\nresting upon the uppermost ring of the body.  The nictitating membrane\r\nwas drawn over its eyes.  It appeared to sleep.  This I thought strange,\r\nas I had heard that the fascinating power of these creatures lay in the\r\neyes.  It soon became evident, how ever, that the bird was not its\r\nobject; for the latter, on seeing that the snake lay still, ceased its\r\nchattering and flew off into the woods.\r\n\r\n\"Believing that the interest of the scene was now over, I was about\r\nraising my rifle to take aim at the snake, when a motion on its part\r\nconvinced me that it was not asleep, but watching.  Watching for what?\r\nA squirrel, perhaps, for this is the creature's favourite prey.  I\r\nlooked up into the tree.  It had all the appearance of being what is\r\ntermed a `squirrel-tree'--that is, a tree in which squirrels have their\r\nnest.  Ha! just as I expected--there was a hole in the trunk, high up;\r\nand around its orifice the bark was slightly discoloured, evidently by\r\nthe paws of the squirrels passing in and out.  Moreover, on looking to\r\nthe ground again, I perceived that a little beaten path, like a\r\nrat-track, led off through the grass.  A ridge-like protuberance that\r\nprojected from the foot of the tree--marking the direction of one of its\r\ngreat roots--ran right into this path; and, from the discoloration of\r\nthe bark above it, it was evident that the squirrels usually climbed up\r\nor descended along this ridge.  The rattlesnake was coiled beside it--so\r\nclose that no animal could pass in that way without coming within his\r\nreach!  I felt certain, then, that he was waiting for the descent of the\r\nsquirrel; and desirous to see what should happen, I muttered some words\r\nof caution to my companions, who remained silent as before.\r\n\r\n\"We sat watching the hole, in expectation to see the squirrel come\r\nforth.  At length, a little rat-shaped head peeped cautiously out; but\r\nin this position the animal remained, and did not seem inclined to trust\r\nitself beyond the mouth of its den.  It was evidently observing us--\r\nwhich it could easily do from its elevated position--and had no\r\nintention of coming down.\r\n\r\n\"We were about giving up all hopes of witnessing a `scene,' when our\r\nattention was drawn to a rustling among the dead leaves in the woods\r\nbeyond.  We looked in that direction.  Another squirrel was running\r\ntoward the tree.  It was running at full speed,--now along the fallen\r\nlogs, now through the grass and dry leaves--apparently pursued.  It\r\n_was_ pursued; for almost at the same instant its pursuer came in\r\nsight--an animal with a long, slender body, twice the length of the\r\nsquirrel itself, and of a bright yellow colour.  It was the\r\n_pine-weasel_.\r\n\r\n\"There were not twenty feet between them as they ran; and both were\r\ndoing their best.\r\n\r\n\"I cast a glance at the rattlesnake.  He knew what was coming.  His jaws\r\nwere extended--the lower one drawn back until it touched his throat,--\r\nhis poisoned fangs were naked and visible; his tongue was protruded\r\nforward; his eyes glanced like diamonds; and his whole body rose and\r\nfell as with a quick respiration.  He seemed to have dilated himself to\r\ntwice his natural size!\r\n\r\n\"The squirrel, looking only behind, ran for the tree, and, like a streak\r\nof light, passed along the ridge and upward.  We saw the snake launch\r\nout his head as the other passed him; but so quick had been the action,\r\nthat it did not seem that he had even touched it.\r\n\r\n\"`Good!' thought we, as we saw the little squirrel sweep up the trunk,\r\nand fancied that it was safe.  Before it had reached the first fork,\r\nhowever, we observed that it climbed more slowly--then faltered--then\r\nstopped altogether.  Its hind feet slipped from the bark; its body\r\noscillated a moment, hanging by the fore-claws, and then dropped heavily\r\nback into the very jaws of the serpent!\r\n\r\n\"The weasel, on seeing the snake, had suddenly stopped a few feet from\r\nit; and now ran around, doubling its long worm-like body, and\r\noccasionally standing erect,--all the while spitting and snarling like\r\nan angry cat.  It was evidently furious at being robbed of its prey; and\r\nwe thought for awhile it was going to give battle to the snake, which\r\nhad re-coiled himself on seeing this enemy, and lay with open jaws\r\nawaiting the attack.  The body of the squirrel--now quite dead--was\r\nclose up to his coil, so that the other could not snatch it without\r\ncoming within reach of his dangerous fangs.\r\n\r\n\"On seeing this, and evidently afraid to encounter such a terrible\r\nantagonist, the weasel, after a while, ceased its hostile\r\ndemonstrations; and, turning to one side, bounded off into the woods.\r\n\r\n\"The reptile now leisurely uncoiled the upper half of his body; and,\r\nstretching out his neck toward the squirrel, prepared to swallow it.  He\r\ndrew the animal out to its full length along the ground, so that its\r\nhead lay towards him.  He evidently purposed swallowing the head first--\r\nin order to take it `with the grain'--and he commenced lubricating it\r\nwith the saliva that ran from his forked tongue.\r\n\r\n\"While we sat watching this curious operation, our attention was\r\nattracted to a movement in the leaves over the spot where the snake lay.\r\nDirectly above him, at a height of twenty or more feet, a huge _liana_,\r\nof the trumpet species, stretched across from tree to tree.  It was full\r\nas thick as a man's arm, and covered with green leaves and large crimson\r\ncuneiform blossoms, such as belonged to itself.  There were other\r\nblossoms mingling with these, for still other parasites--smaller ones--\r\nwere twined around it; and we could distinguish the beautiful star-like\r\nflowers of the cypress vine.  Among these an object was in motion--a\r\nliving object--a body--the body of a great snake, nearly as thick as the\r\nliana itself.\r\n\r\n\"Another rattlesnake!  No; the rattlesnake is _not a tree-climber_,--it\r\ncould not be that.  Besides, the colour of the one upon the vine was\r\nentirely different.  It was of a uniform black all over--smooth and\r\nglittering.  It was the _black_ snake then--the `constrictor' of the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\n\"When we first noticed it, it was wound upon the liana in spiral rings,\r\nlike the worm of a gigantic screw.  We saw that it was slowly gliding\r\ndownward--for the vine tended diagonally from tree to tree, and its\r\nlowest end impinged upon the trunk of the magnolia, about twenty feet\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\n\"On reaching this point, the snake gradually drew its rings closer\r\ntogether--until they appeared to touch each other, lapping the liana.\r\nIt then commenced unwinding itself, by the head, which was slowly\r\ncircled backward around the vine--still, however, creasing closely along\r\nit.  After a sufficient number of evolutions, the rings had completely\r\ndisappeared--with the exception of one or two near the tail--and the\r\nreptile lay doubled along the liana.  These manoeuvres were executed\r\nsilently and with great caution; and it now seemed to pause, and survey\r\nwhat was going on below.\r\n\r\n\"During all this while, the rattlesnake had been busily engaged with the\r\nsquirrel, and thought of nothing else.  After licking the latter to his\r\nsatisfaction, he extended his purple jaws, drew in the head of his\r\nvictim, and, stretching his long body to its full extent, proceeded to\r\nswallow it, tail and all.  In a few seconds, the head and shoulders of\r\nthe squirrel had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"But the glutton was suddenly interrupted in his meal; for, at this\r\nmoment, we observed the black snake gradually lower himself from the\r\nliana, until nothing remained upon the tree but a single loop of his\r\nprehensile tail; and his long body stretching downward, hung directly\r\nover the other.\r\n\r\n\"`Surely,' thought we, `he is not going to encounter the rattlesnake--\r\nthe most terrible of all reptiles.'  But the constrictor understood\r\n_one_ chapter of herpetology better than we--for the next moment we saw\r\nhim drop to the ground; and, almost as quick as thought, appear lapped\r\nin sable folds around the speckled body of the `crotalus!'\r\n\r\n\"It was a singular sight to see those two creatures writhing and\r\nwriggling over the grass; and it was some time before we could tell how\r\nthey battled with each other.  There was no great difference between\r\nthem, in point of size.  The black snake was longer--by a foot or so--\r\nbut much more slender in the body, than his antagonist.  He possessed,\r\nhowever, an advantage that soon made itself apparent--his activity,\r\nwhich was ten times that of the rattlesnake.  We saw that he could\r\neasily evolve or wind himself at pleasure around the body of the\r\nlatter--each time compressing him with those muscular powers which have\r\nentitled him to his name `constrictor.'  At each fresh embrace, the body\r\nof the `crotalus' appeared to writhe and contract under the crushing\r\ninfluence of his sable adversary.\r\n\r\n\"The rattlesnake had but one weapon, which he could have employed with\r\neffect--his fangs.  These were already locked in the body of the\r\nsquirrel, and he could not use them upon his adversary.  He could not\r\nget rid of that hairy morsel, that, like a barbed arrow, was now\r\nsticking in his throat.  We could see that the squirrel still remained\r\nthere; for, as the two reptiles struggled over the grass, its bushy tail\r\nwas seen waving in the midst of their tortuous contest.\r\n\r\n\"At length, the battle began to flag.  The motions of both combatants\r\nwaxed slower and slower.  We could now see _how_ they fought.  We could\r\nsee--strange it appeared to us--that, instead of battling head to head--\r\nface to face--the fangs of the `constrictor' were buried in the rattles\r\nof the `crotalus!'  Stranger still, the tail of the former rose and fell\r\nwith a muscular and powerful impetus, whipping the latter to death!\r\n\r\n\"The contest was soon ended.  The rattlesnake lay stretched at full\r\nlength--evidently dead; while the black constrictor still continued to\r\nhug the speckled body, as though it was an object to be loved.  This\r\nlasted for a moment or so; and then slowly unwinding himself, the\r\nconqueror turned round, crawled head to head with his victim, and\r\nproceeded to appropriate the prey.  The `scene' was over, and we all\r\nleaped to our feet to enact the _finale_.  I should have spared the\r\nconstrictor, after the good service he had done in destroying the\r\nrattlesnake; but Cudjo, who hated all sorts of creeping things, was\r\nahead of me; and, before I could come up, I beheld the victor suspended\r\nupon his spear!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE SUGAR-TREE.\r\n\r\n\"In the evening, we returned to our house, carrying with us, on the back\r\nof Pompo, a good-sized bag of salt.  We had evaporated enough to cure\r\nour venison, and to last us for several weeks to come.  When it should\r\nbe used up, we knew where to go for more.  There was no danger of the\r\nspring going dry.  We had noticed, previous to the discovery of the salt\r\ncreek, that the water of the lake was perceptibly brackish; but we had\r\nnever reflected on the cause.  Doubtless, this fact had prevented us\r\nfrom yearning--as we might otherwise have done--for the valuable\r\nsubstance we had now obtained in such plenty.\r\n\r\n\"That night, after we had finished eating our supper, Harry, who had\r\nbeen all the day burning with curiosity to know what was the important\r\ndiscovery hinted at by his mother, now reminded her of her promise.\r\n\r\n\"`Come, now, mamma!' said he, in a challenging tone, `what is it?--What\r\nhave you found equal to that fine bag of salt, which you will all please\r\nto remember is the fruit of my discovery?'\r\n\r\n\"`But did I promise to tell you to-night?  I said when we should be in\r\nlow spirits, did I not?  We are all happy now!'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh! you said to-night,' replied Harry.  `Besides,' added he, trying to\r\nlook grave, `I _am_ in low spirits.  I have been so all day--ever\r\nsince--ever since--'\r\n\r\n\"`Ever since you let the kettle against my shins, and went\r\nskunk-hunting,' interrupted Frank, with a laugh, in which Cudjo joined\r\nheartily.\r\n\r\n\"This allusion to Harry's morning adventure, which had formed the\r\nstanding joke of the day, was not at all relished by him; and the look\r\nof _mock_ gravity which he had assumed now became _real_.  His mother--\r\nwith whom Harry was a favourite--noticed that he was vexed, and that now\r\nwas the very time to apply the remedy.  She soon, therefore, changed the\r\ncurrent of his thoughts, by proposing to disclose the secret she had\r\npromised.\r\n\r\n\"`Well, then,' said she, `my discovery is this.  While we were going up\r\nthe valley this morning.  I saw at some distance over the woods the top\r\nleaves of a very beautiful and very valuable tree.'\r\n\r\n\"`A tree!' cried Harry; `what! a cocoa-nut?'\r\n\r\n\"`No.'\r\n\r\n\"`A bread-fruit, maybe?'\r\n\r\n\"`No.'\r\n\r\n\"`Orange, then?'\r\n\r\n\"`No, Harry,' replied his mother.  `You must know we are not in that\r\nlatitude.  We are too far north for either bread-fruits, orange-trees,\r\nor cocoa-nut palms.'\r\n\r\n\"`Ah!' exclaimed Harry, with a sigh, `those three are the only trees I\r\ncare a fig for.'\r\n\r\n\"`How, now, if it were a fig-tree, since you speak of figs?'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh! very well,' replied Harry, `figs will do; but I would rather it\r\nhad been one of the others.'\r\n\r\n\"`But it is not even a fig-tree.'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh! it is not.  What then, mamma?'\r\n\r\n\"`That of which I speak is a tree of the temperate zone; and, in fact,\r\ngrows to greatest perfection in the coldest parts of it.  Have you\r\nnoticed some tall straight trees, with thick foliage of a bright red\r\ncolour?'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, mamma,' answered Frank; `I have.  I know a part of the valley\r\nwhere there are many of them--some of them nearly crimson, while others\r\nare orange-coloured.'\r\n\r\n\"`Those are the trees of which I speak.  The leaves are now of those\r\ncolours because it is autumn.  Earlier in the season they were of a\r\nbright green above, and whitish--or, as it is termed, glaucous--on the\r\nunder surface.'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh!' said Harry, seemingly disappointed with this information.  `I\r\nhave noticed them, too.  They are very beautiful trees, it is true; but\r\nthen--'\r\n\r\n\"`Then, what?'\r\n\r\n\"`They are of no use to us--such big trees as they are.  There is no\r\nfruit upon them, for I looked carefully; and what then?  We do not need\r\ntheir timber, I'm sure.  We have as good timber as we want in these\r\ntulip-trees.'\r\n\r\n\"`Come, Master Hal--not so fast, if you please.  There are many parts of\r\na tree which may serve for valuable uses besides its fruit, or its\r\ntimber either.'\r\n\r\n\"`What! the leaves?' inquired the impatient Harry.  `What use can we\r\nmake of leaves?'\r\n\r\n\"`Come, brother,' said Frank, in an improving tone; `the leaves of some\r\ntrees are very valuable.  What think you of the tea-plant, for\r\ninstance?'\r\n\r\n\"Harry felt rebuked, and remained silent.\r\n\r\n\"`We can make no use of the leaves of this tree,' continued his mother;\r\n`at least none that I am aware of.'\r\n\r\n\"`The bark, then?' interrogated Harry.\r\n\r\n\"`No--not the bark either.'\r\n\r\n\"`The roots?'\r\n\r\n\"`I know of no peculiar virtue in its roots more than those of the oak,\r\nash, or any other large timber trees.'\r\n\r\n\"`What then, mamma?  It has no flowers, I am sure; nor fruit neither,\r\nexcept little seeds with wings upon them like a spider-fly.'\r\n\r\n\"`Those are its fruit.'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh! what use could we make of them?  I have seen just the same, or\r\nvery like them, growing on the common sycamore.'\r\n\r\n\"`You are right there, for the common sycamore, as you call it, is a\r\ntree of the same family.  But I did not say we could make any use of\r\nthese winged seeds.  Can you think of nothing else that belongs to every\r\ntree?'\r\n\r\n\"`Nothing!  Let me see--yes--yes--the sap?'\r\n\r\n\"`Ha! the sap!' repeated his mother, with a peculiar emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"`What, mother!' cried Frank, `a maple?'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes! a _sugar-maple_!  Now, Master Hal!'\r\n\r\n\"These words produced a startling effect upon the whole company.  Frank\r\nand his brother had both heard of the famous sugar-maple, though neither\r\nof them had ever seen it.  The younger members, Mary and Luisa, knew\r\nnothing about maples, but the word `sugar' was more familiar to them;\r\nand that, in connexion with the joyous looks of the others, at once\r\nproduced visions of sweetmeats and candy.  Cudjo, too, who had never met\r\nwith the sugar-maple--as it did not grow in the neighbourhood where\r\nCudjo was himself indigenous--nevertheless liked sugar as well as any of\r\nthem, and greeted the announcement with delight.  Nothing was heard for\r\nsome moments but cries of joy, mingled with the words `sugar' and\r\n`sugar-maple.'  Greater is the longing which children, or even men,\r\nexperience for that which is difficult to obtain; and greater is the\r\ndelight that is felt upon the prospect of obtaining it.\r\n\r\n\"After the transport of our little circle had in some degree subsided,\r\nMary proceeded to explain to them the nature of this remarkable tree.\r\n\r\n\"`The sugar-maple,' said she, `you may easily distinguish from other\r\ntrees by its light-coloured bark, and palmate five-lobed leaves, which\r\nin summer are of a bright green colour, but in autumn change, as you\r\nsee, to crimson or orange.  It somewhat resembles the English oak in its\r\ntrunk, branches, and the great mass of foliage which it carries.  Its\r\nwood is very heavy, and is often used in the manufacture of beautiful\r\narticles of furniture, as well as for ships, mills, and other mechanical\r\npurposes.  But the principal value of this tree is found in its sap; and\r\nby the mysterious, but always wise distribution of Nature, it seems to\r\nhave been given to the people of the temperate and colder latitudes, in\r\nplace of the sugar-cane--which, as you know, flourishes only in hot and\r\ntropical countries.\r\n\r\n\"`Each maple,' continued my wife, `will yield annually from three to\r\nfour pounds of excellent sugar; but to do this, it should be tapped\r\nearly in the spring--for the sap does not run in the summer or winter.\r\nIt runs, however, in the autumn--though not so freely as in spring--but\r\nwe must hope that we shall be able to draw as much from ours as will\r\nsupply us until spring comes round again.'\r\n\r\n\"`But, mamma,' broke in the inquisitive Harry, `when and how shall we\r\nget the sap?'\r\n\r\n\"`I suppose, Harry, you wish for separate answers to these two questions\r\nwhich you have put so closely together.  Well, then--our best time to\r\ndraw it will be after the very first frost which makes its appearance.\r\nIt has been found that the sap yields best when the nights are clear and\r\ncold, and the days dry and warm.\r\n\r\n\"`The manner of extracting the sap, and the process of making the sugar,\r\nare both very simple.  In the first place, we must make a great many\r\nlittle troughs--one for every tree we intend to tap.  These are used to\r\nsupply the place of vessels, which of course we have not got.  The\r\nfarmers of the United States, who make maple-sugar, also use these\r\ntroughs--as they will often have several hundred trees running at the\r\nsame time, and it would be rather expensive for a backwoodsman to supply\r\nhimself with so many vessels from either the potter, the tinman, or the\r\ncooper.  But the troughs, which are easily made, answer the purpose just\r\nas well; and Cudjo here is able to make them for us.\r\n\r\n\"`After the troughs nothing more is needed, except a few joints of the\r\ncane which grows here all around us.  An auger-hole must be bored in\r\neach of the trees, about three feet from the ground.  Into each of these\r\nholes a single tube of cane must be inserted, so as to form a spout to\r\nconduct the running sap into the troughs below.  We shall then have\r\nnothing farther to do, but wait while the sap gathers in the troughs,\r\ncollect it into our kettle, and boil it over the fire in the same manner\r\nas we have done the salt water.\r\n\r\n\"`Now, Master Harry,' concluded my wife, `be patient.  Hope for an early\r\nfrost, and you shall have a practical illustration of all these things.'\r\n\r\n\"Harry had not long to wait.  Upon the third night after, a slight\r\nhoar-frost covered the ground, and the day following was bright and\r\nwarm.  This was the very time to tap the maples, and so we set about it.\r\n\r\n\"Cudjo had already prepared the troughs--more than twenty of them in\r\nall.  These he made in the usual manner.  He cut the trunks of several\r\ntulip-trees--those that were about twelve inches in diameter--into logs\r\nof three feet each.  These logs he split into two equal parts, and\r\nhollowed out the split sides with his chisel and mallet--thus forming\r\nrude vessels, but quite good enough for the purpose of holding the sap.\r\nThe cane tubes were also got ready; and proceeding to the trees--all of\r\nus together--we bored a hole in each with our auger, fitted in the cane\r\njoints, and propped the troughs underneath.  In a short time the crystal\r\nliquid began to drip from the ends of the spouts, and then it ran faster\r\nand faster, until a small clear stream fell into the troughs.  The first\r\nthat issued forth we caught in our cups, as the sugar-water is most\r\ndelicious to drink; and it seemed as if our little people, particularly\r\nMary and Luisa, would never say `enough.'  Harry, too, was as fond of it\r\nas they; and was heard to declare that the sugar-maple was the finest\r\ntree of the forest, and quite a match for either bread-fruits, oranges,\r\nor cocoa-palms.  We had brought the large kettle, and a fire was soon\r\nkindled, and a crane erected--just as we had done when making our salt.\r\nIn a few hours the kettle was filled with sap, and boiling over the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\"Each of us had our separate duty to perform Cudjo, with his bucket,\r\nwent from tree to tree, collecting the sap as it gathered in the\r\ntroughs, while Mary and I kept up the fire, and looked to the ladling.\r\nWhen a kettle of the water was sufficiently boiled down, it was\r\nnecessary to pour it out into small vessels, that the sugar might\r\ncrystallise by cooling.  For this purpose we used all our plates,\r\ndishes, and cups.  As soon as it cooled it became hard as a brick, and\r\nof a very dark colour.  It was then removed from the small vessels, and\r\na fresh quantity poured into them.  That part of the sap which would not\r\ncrystallise was carefully strained from the vessels, and became\r\nmolasses; and these, let me tell you, are much finer than the molasses\r\nthat are made from the sugar-cane--much richer in colour, and pleasanter\r\nto the palate.\r\n\r\n\"Frank and Harry had their part to perform--which was to walk about,\r\nrifles in hand, and guard the troughs.  This was an important matter,\r\nfor it is a singular fact that wolves, raccoons, badgers, opossums, and,\r\nin short, every animal wild or tame, will drink the sap of the\r\nsugar-maple, and are so fond of it that they will risk their lives to\r\nget at it.  As the trees we had opened stood at a considerable distance\r\nfrom each other, our two little sentries were kept constantly relieving\r\none another upon their rounds.\r\n\r\n\"The sap continued to run for several days; and, of course, we were kept\r\nbusy during all that time.  Had it been in the spring-time, we should\r\nhave been employed for weeks at it, as it then runs longer and more\r\nfreely.  We were favoured with a smart frost every night, which was a\r\nfortunate circumstance, as the water did not gather during the cold\r\nhours of the night--otherwise we should have found it impossible to\r\nguard the wild animals from our troughs.\r\n\r\n\"All these nights we slept by the fire, where we had made a regular\r\ncamp, as is usual in the backwoods of America.  We only went to the\r\nhouse when it was necessary to get some article that was needed.  We had\r\nput up a little tent, made out of our old wagon-tilt, to cover us; and\r\nthe place we called by the name which is in use among the backwoods\r\nfarmers--that is to say, a `sugar camp.'  We found this out-of-door life\r\nvery exciting and agreeable, camping thus in the thick shady woods with\r\nthe great majestic trees towering over and around us--listening at times\r\nto the light breeze, as it rustled their golden leaves--or lulled into a\r\npleasing tranquillity by the songs of a thousand birds.  At night,\r\nhowever, the music was not so sweet to our ears.  Then we heard the\r\nbarking of wolves, the mournful `coo-whoo-a' of the great horned owl,\r\nand the still more terrifying scream of the cougar.  But we kept up a\r\ncrackling, blazing fire all the night, and we knew that this would keep\r\nthese fierce creatures at bay.\r\n\r\n\"At length our work was done.  The sugar-water flowed each hour more\r\nslowly, and then ceased altogether; and we broke up our camp.  When we\r\nhad returned to our house, and collected our many-shaped loaves--for\r\nthey were of various forms, according to the vessels in which they had\r\nbeen moulded--we found that all together weighed nearly an hundred\r\npounds!  This would be enough for all our wants--at least, until the\r\nspring, when we purposed returning again to our grand store-house among\r\nthe sugar-maples.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE STUMP-TREE AND THE BREAD-PINE.\r\n\r\n\"That evening, as we sat around the supper table, my wife announced that\r\nthe last grain of our coffee was in the pot.  This was sad news to all\r\nof us.  Of the little luxuries that we had brought with us from Saint\r\nLouis, our coffee had held out longest; and a cup of this aromatic\r\nbeverage had often cheered us during our toilsome journey across the\r\nprairie desert.  Often, too, since our arrival in the valley, had it\r\ngiven a relish to our homely meals.\r\n\r\n\"`Well, then,' said I, by way of reply to the announcement, `we must\r\nlearn to do without it.  We have now the materials for making soup; what\r\ncare we for coffee?  How many poor people would be glad to be surrounded\r\nwith luxuries, as we are!  Here we have venison of different kinds; we\r\ncan have beavers' tails whenever we want them.  There are fish, too in\r\nthe lake and stream; there are hares and squirrels, which we shall trap\r\nin abundance, by-and-by; and, in addition to all, we shall dine often\r\nupon ruffed grouse and roast turkey.  I wonder, with all these luxuries\r\naround us, who is not content?'\r\n\r\n\"`But, papa,' said Harry, taking up the discourse, `in Virginia I have\r\noften seen our black folks make coffee out of Indian corn.  It is not\r\nbad, I assure you.  I have drunk it there, and thought it very good.\r\nHave not you, Cudjo?'\r\n\r\n\"`Dat berry coffee dis chile hab drunk, Massa Harry.'\r\n\r\n\"`Now, papa?'\r\n\r\n\"`Well, Harry, what of it?'\r\n\r\n\"`Why should we not use that--the Indian corn, I mean--for coffee?'\r\n\r\n\"`Why, Harry,' said I, `you surely do not reflect upon what you are\r\ntalking about.  We have a far worse want than coffee, and that is this\r\nvery Indian corn you speak of--to make bread.  Could I only get a supply\r\nof that, I should think very little about coffee or any other beverage.\r\nUnfortunately there is not a grain of corn within many an hundred miles\r\nof where we are now sitting.'\r\n\r\n\"`But there is, papa; I know where there is at least a quart of it; and\r\nwithin less than an hundred yards of us, too.'\r\n\r\n\"`Come,' said I, `my boy, you have mistaken some useless seed for corn.\r\nNo corn grows in this valley, I am certain.'\r\n\r\n\"`It did not grow in this valley.  It has travelled all the way from\r\nSaint Louis along with us.  It is now in the wagon.'\r\n\r\n\"`What! corn in the wagon?'  I exclaimed, starting up with such\r\nvehemence as to frighten my children.  `Are you sure of that, Harry?'\r\n\r\n\"`I saw it this very morning in one of the old bags,' replied he.\r\n\r\n\"`Come!' cried I; `get a torch, Cudjo.  To the wagon!--to the wagon!'\r\n\r\n\"In a short time we had reached the wagon, which stood close to the\r\ndoor.  With a beating heart I climbed into it.  There was an old\r\nworn-out buffalo robe, with the harness of the ox lying upon the bottom.\r\nI flung these aside; and underneath I saw a coarse gunny-bag, such as\r\nare used in the Western States for holding Indian corn.  I knew that it\r\nwas one of those we had brought with us from Saint Louis, containing\r\ncorn for our horse and oxen; but I was under the impression that I had\r\nemptied out the last of it long before.  I took the bag up, and, to my\r\ninexpressible delight, found that it still contained a small quantity of\r\nthe precious grain; besides, there was still more of it, that had been\r\nspilled from time to time, and had got into the corners and cracks of\r\nthe wagon.  These we collected carefully and put with the rest--not\r\nleaving a single grain that we did not scrape out from the cracks.  Then\r\ncarrying my bag into the house, I turned out its contents upon the\r\ntable.  To our great joy there was, as Harry had affirmed, nearly a\r\nquart of the golden grain!\r\n\r\n\"`Now,' said I, `we shall have bread!'\r\n\r\n\"This was a glad sight to my wife.  During the preceding days we had\r\nfrequently talked upon this subject--the want of bread--which is one of\r\nour first necessities.  We had lived in hope that we should find some\r\nspecies of cereal in the valley that would supply us with a substitute\r\nfor bread; but up to that time nothing of the kind had appeared.  We had\r\ngathered the mast from the beech-tree and roasted it.  We had collected\r\nquantities of locust-pods and acorns.  We had also eaten the pulpy fruit\r\nof the pawpaw; but all these together we found to be but poor apologies\r\nfor real bread.  This, then, was a discovery of greater importance to us\r\nthan either the salt or the sugar.\r\n\r\n\"The winter, in the latitude of our valley, would be a short one.  We\r\ncould then plant the corn--there was enough of it to plant a whole acre.\r\nIt would come to maturity in six or eight weeks; and we knew that in\r\nsuch a climate we could easily raise two crops in the year--so that\r\nbefore the next winter came round we should have enough and to spare.\r\n\r\n\"While we stood by the table talking over these pleasant prospects, one\r\nof the boys--Frank it was--suddenly shouted out, `Wheat! wheat!'\r\n\r\n\"I looked down to ascertain what he meant.  He had been turning over the\r\nyellow seeds of the maize, and, among them, had discovered several\r\ngrains of wheat.  No doubt there had been wheat in the bag before the\r\ncorn had been put into it; and this was soon confirmed, as, on carefully\r\nsearching the bag, we found several of the precious pickles still\r\nclinging between the seams.  After separating the one species from the\r\nother with great carefulness--for we did not wish to lose a single\r\nseed--we found that our grains of wheat counted exactly one hundred!\r\nThis, to be sure, was a small quantity to go a-farming with, but we\r\nremembered the old saving, `Great oaks grow from little acorns,' and we\r\nknew the importance of these small grey seeds.  In a couple of years we\r\nshould have large crops of wheat.\r\n\r\n\"`You see,' said I, addressing my little family, `how kind Providence\r\nhas been to us.  Here, in the middle of the Desert, has He furnished us\r\nwith all the necessaries of life; and now, with a little patience, we\r\nmay promise ourselves many of its luxuries--for what can mamma not make\r\nout of flour and sugar?'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh, everything!' cried Frank, who had grown enthusiastic at the\r\nprospect of farming, for he was fond of agricultural pursuits; `we can\r\nhave venison-pasties with our flour.'\r\n\r\n\"`And fruit-pies,' added Harry; `there are plenty of fruits.  I have\r\nfound wild plums and cherries, and mulberries as long as my finger, and\r\nwhortle-berries, too.  What delicious puddings we can make.'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes,' said I; `now shall we care for coffee?'\r\n\r\n\"`No, no!' cried Frank and Harry in a breath.\r\n\r\n\"`Then you shall have it,' said their mother, with a smile of peculiar\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n\"`What! mother?' exclaimed Harry, `another tree?'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, indeed, another.'\r\n\r\n\"`Not a coffee-plant?'\r\n\r\n\"`No; but a coffee-tree.'\r\n\r\n\"`A coffee-tree! why I thought, mamma, that they never grew, except in\r\nthe hottest parts of the tropics.'\r\n\r\n\"`That is true enough of the small tree or shrub which produces the\r\ncoffee you have been accustomed to drink; but not far from us there is a\r\nvery large tree, whose seed will give us a very palatable substitute.\r\nHere is a specimen of it.'\r\n\r\n\"So saying, she threw down upon the table a large brown pod--of at least\r\ntwelve inches in length by two in breadth--exactly the shape of a\r\ncrescent or young moon.  It reminded us of the pods of the locust,\r\nthough differing considerably in shape.  Like them, too, when opened--\r\nwhich was forthwith done--it was seen to contain a pulpy substance, in\r\nwhich several large grey-coloured seeds were imbedded.  These seeds, she\r\ninformed us, when parched, ground, and boiled--after the manner of the\r\ntrue coffee--would afford us a beverage nearly as good and quite as\r\nwholesome.\r\n\r\n\"`The tree,' said she, `from which I have plucked this pod, grows in\r\nmost parts of America.  You may have observed it here?'\r\n\r\n\"`I have,' interrupted Harry.  `Now that mamma has shown us the use of\r\nthe maples, I have been looking particularly at all the trees; since I\r\nfind that some of them that appeared scarce worthy of notice, may after\r\nall be very interesting.'\r\n\r\n\"`I have observed the tree,' added Frank, who was something of a\r\nbotanist as well as his mother; `I noticed that its bark is very rough,\r\ndropping off here and there in large curling scales.  The branches, too,\r\nare very odd-looking; they have blunt, stumpy ends, that give the tree a\r\nclumsy appearance.  Is it not so, mamma?'\r\n\r\n\"`Precisely as you say.  Hence its name of \"chicot\" among the Canadian\r\nFrench, and \"stump-tree\" in the United States.  Its botanical name is\r\n_gymnocladus_, which means, \"with naked branches;\" for during the\r\nwinter, as you shall find, it will present a very naked appearance.  It\r\nis also known as the \"Kentucky coffee-tree,\" because the early pioneers\r\nand settlers of that country, when they were unable to obtain the true\r\ncoffee, made use of its seeds, as we intend doing.'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh!' cried Harry; `only think of it--sugar, and coffee, and salt, and\r\nplenty of meat, and roast turkey--everything but bread.  If we only had\r\nbread!  Would our corn not grow if we planted it now, papa?'\r\n\r\n\"`No; the frost would kill the young plants.  We must have patience\r\nuntil spring.'\r\n\r\n\"`It is a long time till spring,' said Harry, with rather a discontented\r\nair; `and then we must wait much longer while the corn is growing.  It\r\nis a very long time to wait.'\r\n\r\n\"`Come, Master Hal,' rejoined his mother, `I fear you are one of those\r\nwho cannot be satisfied, no matter how many blessings are heaped upon\r\nthem.  Remember how many are worse off than yourself--how many are\r\nwithout bread, even where it is plentiest.  No doubt, at this moment\r\nmany a hungry boy in the streets of wealthy London is standing by the\r\nbaker's window, and gazing at the crisp loaves, with no more chance to\r\neat one of them than you have.  He is worse off than you.  You have\r\nother food--plenty of it--he has none; and, moreover, his hunger is\r\nrendered more acute and painful by the sight of the tempting food--\r\nseparated from his hand only by a pane of glass.  Poor boy! that pane of\r\nglass is to him a wall of adamant.  Think upon this, my son, and learn\r\nto be contented.'\r\n\r\n\"`Indeed, I am so, mamma,' replied Harry, with a look of contrition.  `I\r\ndid not mean to complain.  I was only thinking how nice it would be to\r\nhave bread, now that we have got both sugar and coffee.'\r\n\r\n\"`Ah! now, my good Harry,' said his mother, `since I find you in the\r\nproper spirit, I think I must tell you about another curious and useful\r\ntree, of which, perhaps, you have not heard.'\r\n\r\n\"`A bread-fruit now, I'm sure?  No, it cannot be that; for I _have_\r\nheard of the bread-fruit.'\r\n\r\n\"`Still, it might very appropriately be called a bread-fruit, since,\r\nduring the long winter months, it furnishes bread to many tribes of\r\nIndians; indeed, not bread alone, but subsistence--as it is the only\r\nfood these improvident people have.'\r\n\r\n\"`I am sure I have never heard of that tree.'\r\n\r\n\"`Well, I imagine not, as it is not long since it was discovered and\r\ndescribed by botanists; and even now it is but imperfectly known to\r\nthem.  It is a pine.'\r\n\r\n\"`What! a pine with fruit?'\r\n\r\n\"`Did you ever see a pine without it--that is, in the proper season?'\r\n\r\n\"`Then you call those cone-shaped things fruit?'\r\n\r\n\"`Certainly; what else should they be?'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh!  I thought those were the seed.'\r\n\r\n\"`So are they, and the fruit as well.  In botany we have no such word as\r\nfruit.  What you call fruit is in some trees the seed.  In all species\r\nof nuts, for instance, the fruit and the seed are one and the same\r\nthing--that is to say, the kernel of the nut is both fruit and seed.  So\r\nit is with leguminous plants, as beans and peas.  In other trees,\r\nhowever, the fruit is a substance covering and enclosing the seed, as\r\nthe pulp of the apple, the pear, and the orange.  Now, with regard to\r\nthe pines, they are nut-bearing trees, and their seed is at the same\r\ntime their fruit.'\r\n\r\n\"`But, mamma, you do not mean that any one could eat those rough things\r\nthat grow upon pine-trees?'\r\n\r\n\"`Those rough things you speak of are the cones.  They are only the\r\nsheaths that protect the seeds during a certain period of the year.\r\nThey open as nuts do, and then you will find a kernel inside which is\r\nthe true fruit.'\r\n\r\n\"`But I have tasted that, too--it is quite bitter.'\r\n\r\n\"`You have tasted that of the common pine, and you say true of it; but\r\nthere are many species of pine-trees, whose seeds are not only edible,\r\nbut pleasant to the taste, and wholesome as an article of food.'\r\n\r\n\"`What pines, mamma?'\r\n\r\n\"`Several species are known.  Several new ones have been discovered of\r\nlate years, and in this very Desert.  Perhaps in no part of the world is\r\nfound a greater variety of these valuable trees, than in the mountainous\r\ncountries which border upon and lie within the Great American Desert.\r\nThere is one species in California called \"Colorado\" by the Spaniards--\r\nwhich means _red_, because their wood, when sawn up, is of a reddish\r\ncolour.  Trees of this kind are the largest in the world; they are often\r\nover 300 feet in height!  Only think of a tree 300 feet high, when the\r\ntallest we saw in the Mississippi Valley was not much over half that.\r\nYet there are whole forests of these upon the mountains of the Sierra\r\nNevada.  There is another species almost as large on these same\r\nmountains.  It has been called by botanists _pinus Lambertiana_.  It is\r\nmore remarkable, however, for the size of its cones, which are of the\r\nenormous length of eighteen inches--a foot and a half!  Fancy how\r\nsingular a sight it must be--one of these gigantic trees with cones\r\nhanging from its branches larger than sugar-loaves!'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh, beautiful indeed!' exclaimed Frank and Harry at the same time.\r\n\r\n\"`But, mamma,' added Frank, `are these the sort that are eaten by the\r\nIndians?'\r\n\r\n\"`Their seeds are also fit to eat, and in times of great distress the\r\nIndians and others resort to them for food; but it is not of them I\r\nintended to speak.  It is of another kind very distinct from either, and\r\nyet growing in the same region.  It is a small tree, rarely seen of more\r\nthan thirty or forty feet in height, and with leaves or needles of a\r\nmuch lighter green than the generality of pines.  Its cones are not\r\nlarger than those of the common sort; but the seed or kernel is oily\r\nlike the American walnut, and quite as agreeable in flavour.  They\r\ncannot be otherwise than nutritious, since, as I have said, they form\r\nthe whole subsistence of many people for months in the year.  They can\r\nbe eaten raw; but the Indians usually roast them.  When roasted or\r\nparched, and then ground in a mill, or broken in a mortar, they make a\r\nspecies of meal, which, though coarse in appearance, can be baked into\r\nsweet and wholesome bread.  This tree is called by the Mexicans \"pinon,\"\r\nand also by travellers the \"nut-pine.\"  The only botanist who has fairly\r\ndescribed it has given it the name of _pinus monophyllus_.  Perhaps as\r\ngood a name as any, and certainly the most appropriate--I mean for its\r\npopular one--would be the \"bread-pine.\"'\r\n\r\n\"`But, mamma, does this tree grow in our valley?  We have not seen it.'\r\n\r\n\"`Not in the valley, I think; but I have hopes that we may find it on\r\nthe mountain.  The day we came around from Camp Antelope, I thought I\r\nsaw a strange species of pine growing up in the ravines.  It might be\r\nthis very one; and I am the more inclined to think so, as I have heard\r\nthat it grows on the Rocky Mountains--within the latitudes of New\r\nMexico--and also on all the sierras that lie between them and the\r\nPacific.  I see no reason why we should not find it upon our mountain,\r\nwhich is, no doubt, a sort of outlying peak of the Rocky Mountains\r\nthemselves.'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh! then,' said Harry, `shall we not go up to the mountain, and see\r\nabout it?  An excursion to the mountain would be so very pleasant.\r\nDon't you think so, papa?'\r\n\r\n\"`I do, indeed,' I replied; `and as soon as we can make a cart for\r\nPompo, so as to be able to take mamma and the children along with us, we\r\nshall go there.'\r\n\r\n\"This proposal was hailed with delight, as all wished very much to visit\r\nthe beautiful mountain that rose so majestically above us.  It was\r\nsettled, then, that on the first fine day, as soon as our cart should be\r\nconstructed, we would set forth, and make a grand pic-nic to the\r\nSnow-mountain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE SNOW-LINE.\r\n\r\n\"In three days the cart was finished.  We had no difficulty in\r\nconstructing one, as the principal part--that is, the wheels--was\r\nalready made.  We had two pair of them, of course, in our old wagon; and\r\nthe larger ones, which happened to be in very good order, served our\r\npurpose exactly.  Cudjo soon attached a body and shafts to them, and\r\nPompo's harness was put into thorough repair.\r\n\r\n\"We had not long to wait for a fine day.  Every day was fine in the\r\nclear, pure climate of our valley; so that, as soon as the cart was\r\nready, we had a day to our liking.\r\n\r\n\"We set out shortly after sunrise, with our hearts full of anticipated\r\npleasure.  Of course we all went--Mary, the children, Cudjo, Pompo,\r\ndogs, and all.  The house was again left to take care of itself.  Mary\r\nand the two little ones rode in the cart, upon a soft seat made of\r\npalmetto leaves and Spanish moss.  Pompo, who appeared to partake of the\r\ngeneral happiness, whisked the vehicle along as if there had been nobody\r\nin it, and he was only drawing it for his own amusement.  Cudjo cracked\r\nhis great wagon-whip, and every now and then uttered a loud `wo-ha;'\r\nwhile Castor and Pollux galloped gaily from side to side, running their\r\nnoses into every bush that grew near the path.\r\n\r\n\"We soon made our way through the valley, and climbed up to the plain.\r\nWe looked once more upon the Desert that stretched away on all sides;\r\nbut its dreary aspect no longer filled us with fear.  We did not regard\r\nit now, and the sight inspired us with feelings of curiosity and novelty\r\nrather than of terror.  Away to the southward the sun was glancing upon\r\nthe broad expanse of white sand; and several tall objects, like vast\r\ndun-coloured towers, were moving over the plain.  They were whirlwinds\r\ncarrying the dust upward to the blue sky, and spinning it from point to\r\npoint.  Sometimes one glided away alone, until it was lost on the\r\ndistant horizon.  Here two of them were moving in the same direction,\r\nkeeping a regular distance from each other, and seemingly running a\r\nrace.  There several came together; and, after a short gusty contest,\r\nthe whole set would break up into shapeless masses of yellowish clouds,\r\nand then float onward with the wind, and downward to the earth again.\r\nIt was an interesting sight to view those huge pillars towering up to\r\nthe heavens, and whirling like unearthly objects over the wide plain.\r\nIt was indeed an interesting sight, and we remained for many minutes\r\nobserving their motions.\r\n\r\n\"At length we turned our faces toward the mountain, and continued our\r\njourney along the edge of the cliffs.  The high peak glistened before\r\nus, and the sun's rays falling upon it caused it to appear of a\r\nbeautiful colour--a mixture of gold and red, as though a shower of roses\r\nhad fallen upon the snow!  We noticed that there was now more snow upon\r\nthe mountain than when we had first seen it, and that it came farther\r\ndown its sides.  This attracted the attention of all of us; and Frank at\r\nonce called for an explanation, which his mother volunteered to give,\r\nfor she very well understood the phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\"`In the first place,' said she, `as you ascend upwards in the\r\natmosphere, it becomes thinner and colder.  Beyond a certain point it is\r\nso cold, that neither men nor any other animals can exist.  This can be\r\nproved in several ways; and the experience of those who have climbed\r\nmountains, only three miles high, confirms it.  Some of these\r\nadventurous men have been nearly frozen to death.  This is a fact, then,\r\nin regard to the atmosphere over all parts of the earth; but we may also\r\nobserve, that under the Equator you may go higher without reaching this\r\nextreme cold, than in the countries which lie nearer to the Poles.\r\nAnother fact, which you will easily believe, is, that in summer you can\r\nclimb higher before you reach the cold region than in winter.  Bear\r\nthese facts in mind.  Now, then, if it be so cold at a certain height\r\nthat men would be frozen to death, of course at that height snow will\r\nnot melt.  What is the natural inference?  Why--that mountains whose\r\ntops pierce up into this cold region will most certainly be covered with\r\nperpetual snow.  It is not likely that anything but snow ever falls upon\r\ntheir summits,--for when it rains upon the plains around them, it is\r\nsnowing upon the high peaks above.  Indeed, it is probable that most of\r\nthe rain which descends upon the earth has been crystals of snow when it\r\ncommenced its descent; and, afterwards melting in the lower and warmer\r\nregions of the atmosphere, takes the shape of water globules, and thus\r\nfalls to the ground.  These globules, no doubt, are very small when they\r\nfirst emerge from the snow region; but, as they pass slowly downward\r\nthrough clouds of vapour, they gather together and attract others (by a\r\nlaw which I have not time to explain); and, descending faster and\r\nfaster, at length plash down to the earth in large drops.  Whenever it\r\nrains, then, at any particular place, you may be almost certain that it\r\nis snowing at the same time over that place--only at a point in the\r\natmosphere far above it.  I have been convinced of this fact, by\r\nobserving that immediately after every occasion when it has rained in\r\nthe valley, there appeared a greater quantity of snow upon the mountain.\r\nHad the mountain not been there, this snow would have continued on, and\r\nbecome rain, like that which fell upon the plains, and into the valley.'\r\n\r\n\"`Then, mamma,' interrupted Frank, `this mountain must be of great\r\nheight, since the snow lies upon it all the year.'\r\n\r\n\"`Does that follow?'\r\n\r\n\"`I think so.  You said the snow did not melt because it was cold high\r\nup.'\r\n\r\n\"`But suppose you were in a country near the North Pole, where snow lies\r\nall the year at the very sea-side, and consequently at the sea-level,\r\nwould it then prove a mountain to be very high?'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh!  I see--I see now.  The perpetual snow upon a mountain only shows\r\nit to be of great height when the mountain happens to be in warm\r\nlatitudes.'\r\n\r\n\"`Precisely so.  In very warm countries, such as those within the\r\ntropics, when you see the snow-cap upon a mountain, you may infer that\r\nit is a very high one--at least over two miles in height; and when there\r\nis much snow upon it--that is, when the snow reaches far down its\r\nsides--it proves the mountain to be still higher,--three miles or more\r\nabove the level of the ocean.'\r\n\r\n\"`Our mountain, then, must be a high one, since it is in a warm\r\nlatitude, and snow lies all the year upon it.'\r\n\r\n\"`It is a high one, comparatively speaking; but you will remember, when\r\nwe first saw it, there was only a small patch of snow upon its top, and\r\nprobably in very hot summers that disappears altogether; so that it is\r\nnot so high as many others upon this continent.  Taking our latitude\r\ninto calculation, and the quantity of snow which lies upon this\r\nmountain, I should say it was about 14,000 feet.'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh! so much as that!  It does not seem half so high.  I have seen\r\nmountains that appeared to me to be quite as high as it, and yet it was\r\nsaid they did not measure the half of 14,000 feet.'\r\n\r\n\"`That arises from the fact that you are not viewing this one from the\r\nsea-level, as you did them.  The plain upon which it stands, and from\r\nwhich we view it, is of itself elevated nearly half as much.  You must\r\nremember that we are upon one of the high tables of the American\r\ncontinent.'\r\n\r\n\"Here, for a minute or so, the conversation stopped; and we travelled on\r\nin silence, all of us with our eyes fixed on the white and roseate peak\r\nthat glittered before us, leading our eyes far up into the heavens.\r\n\r\n\"Frank again resumed the discourse, which had been broken off by our\r\nadmiration of this beautiful object.\r\n\r\n\"`Is it not curious,' said he, `that the snow should lie so regularly,\r\ncoming down on all sides to the same height, and ending just like the\r\ncape of a coat or the hem of a nightcap?  It seems to be a straight line\r\nall around the mountain.'\r\n\r\n\"`That line,' rejoined his mother, `is, as you say, a curious\r\nphenomenon, and caused by the laws of heat and cold, which we have just\r\nbeen explaining.  It is called the \"snow-line,\" and a good deal of\r\nspeculation has arisen among cosmographers about the elevation of this\r\nline.  Of course, on mountains within the tropics this line will be at a\r\ngreat height above the level of the sea.  As you advance northward or\r\nsouthward to the Poles, it will be found lower and lower, until within\r\nthe frigid zones it may be said to cease altogether--for there, as we\r\nhave said, snow covers the whole earth, and there can be no \"snow-line.\"\r\n\r\n\"`From this, one would suppose that an exact scale might be formed,\r\ngiving the elevation of the snow-line for all latitudes.  But that could\r\nnot be done.  Observation has shown that it not only differs on\r\nmountains that lie in the same latitude, but that on the same mountain\r\nit is often higher on one side than the other--particularly on those of\r\ngreat extent, as the Himmalehs of India.  This is all quite natural, and\r\neasily accounted for.  The position of mountains to one another, and\r\ntheir proximity or great distance from the sea, will give them a colder\r\nor warmer atmosphere, independent of latitude.  Moreover, the same\r\nmountain may have a warmer climate on one side than the other; and of\r\ncourse the snow-line will be higher on that side which is the warmer, in\r\nconsequence of the greater melting of the snow.  This line, too, varies\r\nin summer and winter for a like reason--as we see here upon our own\r\nmountain, where it has already descended several feet since the weather\r\nbecame colder.  This, you will acknowledge, is all very natural; and you\r\nwill see, too, that Nature, although apparently capricious in many of\r\nher operations, acts most regularly in this one, as perhaps in all\r\nothers.'\r\n\r\n\"`But, mamma,' inquired Harry, `can we not get to the top of the\r\nmountain?  I should like to have some snow to make snow-balls, and pelt\r\nFrank with them.'\r\n\r\n\"`It would be a very difficult task, Master Hal; and more than either\r\nyou or I could get through with.  I think Frank will escape being\r\nsnow-balled this time.'\r\n\r\n\"`But people have climbed to the top of the Himmaleh mountains; and they\r\nare far higher than this, I am sure.'\r\n\r\n\"`Never,' interrupted Frank; `no one has ever climbed the Himmalehs.\r\nHave they, mamma?'\r\n\r\n\"`No mortal has ever been so high as the summits of those great\r\nmountains, which are more than five miles above the level of the ocean.\r\nEven could they be climbed, it is not likely that any animal could live\r\nat their top.  These inaccessible things seem to have been designed by\r\nthe Creator to afford us objects for sublime contemplation--objects far\r\nabove the reach of mortal man, and that can never be rendered common by\r\nhis contact.  Do they not seem so?'\r\n\r\n\"We had now reached the foot of the mountain, and halting near the\r\nentrance of the ravine, we loosed Pompo from his cart, and rested\r\nourselves on the banks of the little stream.  After a while we commenced\r\nascending up into the defile in search of the pinons.  As we advanced,\r\nMary pointed out the trees which she had noticed on a former occasion.\r\nThey appeared of a light green colour, much lighter than others that\r\ngrew near them.  We made towards one which stood apart, and was most\r\naccessible to us.  This we hoped might prove to be the bread-pine tree;\r\nand we approached it with feelings of anxiety and expectation.\r\n\r\n\"In a short time we were under its branches; and if we had had no other\r\ntest than what we saw there, combined with the delicious fragrance of\r\nthe tree, we could have told that it could be no other than the pinon.\r\nThe ground was covered with cones, each of them about an inch and a half\r\nin length; but on examining them, we found them all broken open and the\r\nseed extracted.  Some animal had been there before us, and relished\r\ntheir contents--thus affording a proof that they were good to eat.\r\nThere were still many of the cones hanging on the tree; and it was not\r\nlong until we had split some of them open and tasted their ripe seeds.\r\n\r\n\"`It is it!' cried my wife, clapping her hands with delight.  `It is the\r\nnut-pine!  This will serve for bread until we can grow our wheat and\r\ncorn.  Come, let us gather them,' added she, pointing to a large grove\r\nof the same trees that grew at a short distance; and we all hurried to\r\nthe grove, and commenced shaking down the cones and gathering them into\r\nheaps.\r\n\r\n\"We had soon collected as many as we wanted, and in the evening we\r\nreturned to the valley, with our little cart half-full of pine-nuts.  On\r\nreaching home, some of them were parched and pounded into a sort of\r\ncoarse meal; and that night, for the first time during many weeks, we\r\nhad cakes to our supper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE MENAGERIE, AVIARY, AND BOTANIC GARDEN.\r\n\r\n\"We were busy of course every day, as we had plenty of work to do.  We\r\nlaid a floor in our cabin, and fenced a couple of fields--one to plant\r\nour corn in, and the other to keep Pompo from straying off into the\r\nwoods, and meeting with some animal that might feel inclined to devour\r\nhim.  We also succeeded in killing several red-deer and a couple of elk,\r\nwhich we stored up for our winter provision.  We did not find the\r\nblack-tails very palatable, and most of their flesh went to feed Castor\r\nand Pollux.\r\n\r\n\"Cudjo was the busiest of all of us.  He made several household utensils\r\nwhich proved of great service to us.  He also constructed for himself a\r\nwooden plough, which would serve every purpose--as there was a\r\nconsiderable portion of the ground that was without turf, and could be\r\neasily turned.  This part had been covered with beautiful flowers, such\r\nas sunflowers, red and orange-coloured poppies, and asclepias.  It was\r\nalmost a pity to plough them up.\r\n\r\n\"With an eye to the future scarcity of our ammunition, we had begun to\r\npractise hunting with a weapon which would answer all our purposes\r\nalmost as well as the rifle--still keeping the latter of course for\r\ngreat occasions.  We had found some of the _bois d'arc_, or \"Osage\r\norange,\" as it is called, growing in the valley.  This is the famous\r\nbow-wood of the Indians; and taking a hint from these children of\r\nNature, we made three bows, stringing them--as the Indians do--with the\r\nsinews of the deer.  For arrows, we had the straight cane-reeds; and\r\nCudjo made us a set of barbs out of iron spikes that we had taken from\r\nthe wagon.  With daily practising at a mark, before the winter was over,\r\nwe were all three able to use our new weapons to some purpose; and\r\nHarry, to his mother's great delight, could bring down a squirrel from\r\nthe top of the highest tree in the valley.  As a marksman, both with the\r\nbow and rifle, he was quite superior to Frank, who, instead of feeling\r\njealous, seemed rather to be proud of the skill of his brother.  Harry,\r\nduring all the winter, kept our table loaded with partridges,\r\nsquirrels--of which there were several species--hares, and wild turkeys;\r\nthe last of which, being much finer than tame ones, of course we were\r\nall very fond of.\r\n\r\n\"My wife, too, added largely to the delicacies of our table.  During the\r\nlast days of autumn, she made several botanical excursions--of course,\r\nall of us accompanying her by way of guard--and in each of these some\r\nuseful production was discovered.  We found several species of wild\r\nfruits--currants, cherries, and a small fruit known as the\r\n\"serviceberry,\" which grew in great profusion.  All these fruits were\r\ngathered in quantity, and made into preserves.  We obtained roots as\r\nwell--one of which was the _pomme-blanche_, or Indian turnip; but the\r\nmost interesting of all was the wild potato, which we dug up--for, in\r\nfact, it is only upon the table-lands of America where that plant is\r\nindigenous.  We should not have recognised it as an old acquaintance,\r\nbut for the botanical knowledge of my wife.  Its roots were not larger\r\nthan wren's eggs, and we could find so few of them that, in its wild\r\nstate, we saw it would be of no use to us as an article of food.  Mary,\r\nhowever, had hopes, that by cultivation, we might produce larger ones;\r\nso we collected all the tubers we could fall in with, and kept them for\r\nseed.\r\n\r\n\"Out of the pods of the honey-locust, we brewed a very agreeable sort of\r\nbeer; but we were able to extract a still more generous beverage from\r\nthe wild or fox-grapes that grew in all parts of the valley.  While\r\ntravelling through France, I had learnt how wine was made; and our\r\nvintage succeeded to perfection.  On the winter nights, as we sat around\r\nour cheerful log-fire, Mary was accustomed to deal out to us a measure\r\na-piece of the exhilarating drink.  It was only, however, after a hard\r\nday's work or hunting, that we were allowed to draw upon this precious\r\nstore.\r\n\r\n\"About this time, a new idea entered into my mind, which I communicated\r\nto the others, and with which they all fully agreed.  It was this:--To\r\ncapture as many of the wild animals as we could, and endeavour to\r\ndomesticate them to our uses.  I was prompted to this purpose by various\r\nconsiderations.  First, because I saw, although there were several kinds\r\nof deer in the valley, there were but few of each kind; and it was not\r\nlikely that for many years they had been upon the increase.  Nature had\r\nso disposed it, that these creatures had been regularly thinned off\r\nevery year by the numerous beasts of prey that prowled through the\r\nvalley.  Now, an additional enemy was added to the number of their\r\ndestroyers; and I foresaw that, unless some precaution should be taken,\r\nthe deer would soon become so scarce and wild, that we should find it\r\ndifficult to obtain enough for our uses.  Could we only kill off the\r\nfierce beasts--such as panthers, and wolves, and wolverenes--that preyed\r\nupon them, then the whole valley would become our deer-park, and the\r\ndeer would soon increase to any number we wanted.  This, however, we\r\ncould not do; and, in fact, the beasts of prey were as likely to master\r\nus as we them--for none of us were safe in venturing into the thick\r\nwoods alone; and whenever the boys made a short excursion from the\r\nglade, their mother was always in a state of anxiety until they\r\nreturned.  In fact, every hunt we made was attended with considerable\r\ndanger, as we always fell in with the tracks of wolves, panthers, and\r\neven bears; and we frequently saw these animals skulking through the\r\nunderwood.  We knew that in time our powder must run out, and then our\r\nrifles would be useless to us.  Our bows and arrows would then avail us\r\nbut little against such thick-hided monsters as these.  We only hoped\r\nthat when we became better acquainted with the habits of these\r\ncarnivorous creatures, we should be enabled to destroy them in traps,\r\nand thus thin them off at our leisure, and without wasting our\r\nammunition.  This, of course, would constitute a branch of our\r\nemployment; and, besides being a work of utility, would furnish us with\r\nan excitement not the less agreeable because it was hazardous.  Could\r\nwe, therefore, collect a few of the more useful animals into an enclosed\r\npark, they would soon propagate and increase; and then the trouble as\r\nwell as danger which we experienced in hunting them would be at an end.\r\nWe knew that our maize-corn, yielding two crops in the year, would\r\nenable us to supply them abundantly with food.\r\n\r\n\"There was still another consideration which had its weight in these\r\nplans.  I was very fond of the study of natural history--particularly\r\nthat branch of it relating to quadrupeds--and I foresaw the pleasure of\r\nobserving the habits of these wild creatures.  We should not, therefore,\r\nconfine ourselves to making `pets' of those animals that might merely\r\nserve us for food.  We should embrace in our collection all that we\r\ncould subject to our rule, whether gentle or fierce.  In fact, it was\r\nour intention to establish a regular `menagerie of the Desert.'\r\n\r\n\"The main object of our industry and prospective wealth--that is, the\r\ncollection of the beaver fur--would not in any way interfere with these\r\nplans.  The beavers, in short, would give as very little trouble--as the\r\ndrying and preserving the skins of those we should trap would only\r\noccupy us a small portion of the year.\r\n\r\n\"Harry entered with more spirit into my designs than any of the others;\r\nfor Harry, like myself, was fond of quadrupeds.  Frank, on the other\r\nhand, was a great bird-catcher; and recommended that we should include\r\nbirds in our menagerie.  To this, of course, we assented freely.  Mary\r\nhad her own designs already shaped out; and these were, to gather all\r\nthe plants and trees that might be either curious or useful, and to\r\nobserve what effect cultivation would produce upon them--in short, it\r\nwas her wish to form a complete `botanical garden.'\r\n\r\n\"To each, then, was given a separate department.  Harry and I were\r\ndesignated `beast-tamers;' Frank the `bird-tamer;' while Mary was\r\nappropriately styled the `tree-tamer.'  To Cudjo was assigned a very\r\nimportant share of the labour.  He was to enclose the park for our deer,\r\nas well as the grounds for the botanic garden.  He was also to make our\r\ntraps and cages--all of which things Cudjo knew how to do, and how to do\r\nthem well.  Of course, we were to assist him, as well as each other, in\r\ncarrying out our designs.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, our plans for the future were interesting to all of us.  In our\r\nvarious pursuits, we should be enabled to employ all our idle time.  We\r\nhad no books, either to amuse or instruct us; but we knew that we should\r\nderive both instruction and amusement from the study of the greatest of\r\nall books--_the book of Nature_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY NINE.\r\n\r\nTRAPPING THE BEASTS AND BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\"Harry was the first who succeeded in making a capture; and that was a\r\npair of grey squirrels, which he had trapped at the bottom of their\r\ntree.  For these a large cage was constructed, and they soon became so\r\ntame that they would take the nuts provided for them out of our hands.\r\nThese, of course, were only idle pets; but they added much to our\r\ncompany and amusement, as we watched them in their antics around the\r\nbars of their cage, now springing from point to point, and now sitting\r\nmonkey-like, and gnawing the nuts as they held them between their\r\nfore-paws.\r\n\r\n\"Shortly after this event, Frank became the hero of the hour; and his\r\nachievement was one of considerable importance.  For some time, he had\r\nbeen keeping his eye upon the wild turkeys; and for the purpose of\r\nsecuring some of them alive, he had constructed, not far from the house,\r\na species of penn--which is known in America by the name of `log-trap.'\r\nThis was a very simple contrivance.  It was made of split rails, such as\r\nCudjo used for his fences; and these were placed upon one another, so as\r\nto enclose a hollow square between them.  They were raised about the\r\nheight of an ordinary fence from the ground, while other rails--heavy\r\nones--were laid over the top, close enough to prevent the turkeys,\r\nshould they enter, from escaping, but not so near each other as to\r\ndarken the interior of the trap, and so render it forbidding in its\r\nappearance.  The entrance was the main contrivance, although it was not\r\nan original idea with Frank.  It was upon a plan similar to the wire\r\ncages used for trapping rats--where the rat can easily find its way in,\r\nbut has not sufficient cunning to know the road out again.  Precisely as\r\nthe wire funnel is constructed for the rats, Frank had made one of rails\r\nfor his turkeys; and waited patiently until some of them should enter\r\nit.  He placed various kinds of seeds and roots within the enclosure;\r\nbut several days passed, and no birds were taken.\r\n\r\n\"After some practice, the `bird-catcher' became able to imitate the\r\n`gobbling' of the old cock? so exactly that at some distance off in the\r\nwoods, you could not tell but that it was one of themselves.  By this\r\nmeans, he could call the turkeys up to the ground where he himself lay\r\nconcealed; but the seeds he had baited his trap with were not\r\nsufficiently enticing, and none of them would go under the rails.  At\r\nlength, however, he hit upon an expedient, which was sure to succeed, if\r\nanything could.  He had shot one of the turkeys with his arrows; and\r\ntaking it into the trap, he carefully propped it up--so that it appeared\r\nto be still alive, and busy feeding upon his bait.  He then retired to\r\nsome distance; and, hiding himself among the brushwood, `gobbled' as\r\nbefore.  Three large birds soon made their appearance, coming cautiously\r\nthrough the woods.  Of course, like all wild turkeys, they were down\r\nupon the ground--stalking along just like so many ostriches.  At length,\r\nthey came in sight of the penn, and seeing one of their own kind;--\r\nquietly feeding, as they thought, within it--they approached fearlessly,\r\nand ran around the enclosure, seeking for an entrance.  Frank lay\r\nwatching all their movements; and his heart, at this moment, was\r\nthumping against his ribs.  His anxiety did not long endure.  The three\r\ngreat birds soon found the wide funnel; and, without hesitating, ran up\r\nit and appeared inside the trap.  Frank sprang from his lurking-place;\r\nand, running forward, first shut up the entrance by filling it with\r\nstones.  Then climbing upon the top, he slipped through between the\r\nrails; and secured the birds by tying their legs together with a stout\r\nthong of deerskin.  When he had lifted them out of the trap, he again\r\nadjusted everything--leaving the `decoy turkey' quietly feeding as\r\nbefore--and shouldering his prize, he marched off in triumph.  His\r\nreturn to the house was greeted with exclamations of joy; and a rail\r\npenn was immediately built for the birds, similar to the trap in which\r\nthey had been caught, but, of course, without the funnel or entrance.\r\nThe only regret we had was, that the three were all cocks--regular `old\r\ngobblers.'\r\n\r\n\"Next day, however, Frank remedied this by making a still more important\r\ncapture.  On returning to visit his trap before sunrise, he saw from a\r\ndistance that there was a live turkey inside, with a number of smaller\r\nbirds, which in the grey light appeared like so many partridges.  On\r\ngetting nearer, to his surprise and delight, he found that what he had\r\ntaken for partridges was a large brood of young turkeys, and that which\r\nhe had first seen was their mother.  The little ones were running out\r\nand in, for they could easily pass between the rails, while the mother\r\nran around, thrusting her head out of the penn, and occasionally\r\nspreading her wings and flapping upwards, endeavouring to escape in that\r\ndirection.  The young were all making a great ado, and evidently aware\r\nthat their mother was `in the trap.'\r\n\r\n\"Frank, fearing that the youngsters might get off if he attempted to\r\napproach them alone, came back to the house, and summoned Harry, Cudjo,\r\nand myself, to his assistance.  To make sure of them, we took with us\r\nthe long canvass tilt of the wagon with a couple of blankets fastened to\r\nit at the end.  We adopted every precaution, as we looked upon capturing\r\nthis young brood as a thing of great importance--since we could bring\r\nthem up quite domesticated, and from them should breed as many more as\r\nwe pleased.  We approached the penn with all due caution; and when near\r\nwe separated, each of us taking a side.  We then advanced upon the trap,\r\ncompletely surrounding it; and, while the birds ran confusedly from side\r\nto side, we stretched the tilt and blankets all around the penn, thus\r\ncutting off their retreat.  In a few moments we had secured both the old\r\nhen and her chicks--amounting, in all, to no less than eighteen of them!\r\nThis was a capture, indeed; and we immediately hurried back to the\r\nhouse with them, not forgetting to take along with us the `decoy\r\nturkey'--which, being a fine fat fellow, and killed only the day before,\r\nserved us for a very good dinner.  For the turkey hen and young we built\r\nanother penn, near to that where we had imprisoned the three `old\r\ngobblers.'  The one last constructed was made with more care and closer\r\nbetween the rails, so that the youngsters might not get out and wander\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\"Frank again baited his log-trap, and used for a decoy one of the\r\ngobblers, which he tied by the leg to a rail.  In this way several\r\nothers were caught; when the birds at length became shy, and kept away\r\nfrom the penn altogether.  However, we had now as many as we could feed,\r\nuntil our corn should ripen and be gathered.\r\n\r\n\"From this time every day saw new additions to our aviary.  Frank had\r\nprocured the bark of the _ilex opaca_, or American holly; and this, when\r\nmacerated in water, and then fermented and cleared of its fibres, made\r\nthe very best bird-lime.  A large cage had been constructed out of\r\nbow-wood with the straight reeds of the cane, and divided into many\r\ncompartments--so that birds of different species should be separated\r\nfrom each other.  In a short time the cage was seen to contain specimens\r\nof the blue-jay and red-bird, or Virginia nightingale, orioles of\r\nseveral species, and doves of two distinct kinds.  There were also\r\nseveral Carolina paroquets; and Frank had succeeded in capturing a bird\r\nof a very rare kind, which, I believe, is known to the Indians as the\r\n`wakon.'  It was the American bird of paradise; and, like those of the\r\nEastern world, had several long feathers growing from its tail, and\r\nstretching away gracefully behind it.  In the cage were also finches of\r\ndifferent varieties, and beautiful bright plumage.  Among others were\r\nthe green bird, the redstart, and the cock of the woods; the little blue\r\nbird also, the red-winged starring, and the orange-headed troupiale--\r\nwhich last species migrated in large flocks into the valley.  There was\r\na number of small cages, which had been constructed for the smallest of\r\nall birds--the humming-birds--and Frank had caught no less than a dozen\r\ndifferent kinds of these most beautiful creatures, which he daily\r\nsupplied with fresh flowers.  Another cage, apart from all the rest,\r\nheld an inmate that; so far as appearance went, you would have said had\r\nno right to be thus distinguished in having a house all to himself.  He\r\nwas of a sober grey colour, somewhat of the wagtail shape, with long\r\nblack legs, and claws of a dirty hue; and was altogether an ill-favoured\r\nbird, not any better-looking than a common house-sparrow.  Had you known\r\nnothing more about him than his outward appearance, you would hardly\r\nhave deigned to waste a second look upon him.  The moment, however, his\r\nblack bill was opened, and his lead-coloured throat became expanded in a\r\nsong, you forgot all about the dull hue of his plumage.  You all at once\r\nforgot the bright wings of the paroquet, and the beautiful form of the\r\noriole; the red-bird, the blue-jay, and the wakon, were alike forgotten,\r\nand you gazed upon this sweet musician with delight and admiration.  As\r\nyou continued to listen, you would notice that he mimicked almost every\r\nsound that occurred within hearing.  When any of the others commenced to\r\nsing, he would catch the strain--as it were, from their lips--and,\r\ngiving it in a far higher and bolder tone, shame them into silence.\r\nThis, I need hardly tell you, was the famous mock-bird--the nightingale\r\nof America.\r\n\r\n\"While Frank was daily increasing his stock of winged creatures, Harry\r\nwas not idle among the quadrupeds.  No less than five kinds of squirrels\r\nhad been caught and caged.  These were the grey, black, and red or fox\r\nvarieties of the tree squirrel, and two species of ground squirrel--one\r\nthe common hackee, or chipping squirrel; while the other was a new\r\nspecies, which we had caught on the desert plain above, among the roots\r\nof the _artemisia_ plant.  This last was a beautiful little creature,\r\nnot much larger than a mouse, and striped like a little zebra.  It has\r\nnever--as far as I can tell--been described by naturalists; and on this\r\naccount, as well as from its peculiar size and beauty, it was a general\r\nfavourite with all of us, particularly with Luisa and Mary, in whose\r\nlaps it soon learnt to sleep, like a tamed mouse.\r\n\r\n\"Besides the squirrels, Harry's collection embraced a hare and a couple\r\nof raccoons.  These last were the produce of a night-hunt or two which\r\nCudjo had made with the dogs; and although these fox-like animals were\r\nby no means useful pets, yet they gave a variety to our collection, and\r\nadded to our amusement in the observation of their curious habits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY.\r\n\r\nTHE BITERS BIT.\r\n\r\n\"Our next was a fishing excursion.  As I have said, Cudjo had already\r\ndiscovered that our stream contained fish, and had caught several of\r\nthem.  They were something like bass, although differing considerably\r\nfrom the common species.  Nevertheless they were very delicious eating,\r\nand we were all very fond of them.\r\n\r\n\"We set forth in the morning, but on this occasion we left Pompo and his\r\ncart behind, as we had not far to go--only a short distance down the\r\nstream, where Cudjo knew a large pool in which the fish were plenty.  We\r\ntook with us lines, made out of the wild flax that grows in the valley,\r\nand which, Mary tells us, is found in all countries that border upon the\r\nRocky Mountains.  Our rods were long tapering canes such as grew in\r\nabundance around us.  For hooks we used pins bent into the proper shape;\r\nand our bait consisted of a variety of worms.  All these things were\r\ncarried by Harry and Frank, while Cudjo and I took the younger ones in\r\nour arms, and Mary was left free to botanise as we passed along.  Castor\r\nand Pollux accompanied us of course; and Pompo, as he saw us leave the\r\nhouse, ran neighing around his enclosure, as if quite vexed at our\r\nleaving him behind.  Cudjo, of course, became our guide, taking us\r\nthrough the woods to that part of the stream where was his favourite\r\nfishing-ground.\r\n\r\n\"After travelling at our leisure about a quarter of a mile, we were all\r\nbrought to a sudden halt by an exclamation from my wife, who stood\r\npointing at some trees a little to one side of the path.\r\n\r\n\"`What, mamma!' cried Harry, `another fine tree?  Why, the real\r\nbread-fruit and the cocoa-nuts will turn up yet, I believe, in spite of\r\nour latitude.'\r\n\r\n\"`I am sorry for your sake, Harry,' replied his mamma, `as well as our\r\nown, that I have not made the discovery of another fine tree.  No, it is\r\nquite another thing, and not a very useful discovery.  But it may be\r\ncurious to you; and papa, here, can read you a chapter of natural\r\nhistory upon it.  It is in his line.  It is a four-footed animal.'\r\n\r\n\"`Animal!' exclaimed Harry; `I see no animal.  Where is it, mamma?'\r\n\r\n\"`Nor do I,' replied his mother; `but I see indications of the presence\r\nof one, and a very destructive one, too.  Look there!'\r\n\r\n\"As Mary said this, she pointed to a grove of young cotton-wood trees,\r\nfrom which the bark and leaves were stripped off as cleanly as if they\r\nhad been gnawed by goats, or scraped with a knife.  Some of the trees\r\nwere quite dead, while others of them were freshly peeled, and only\r\nwaited for a little time to go to decay also.\r\n\r\n\"`Oh, I see what you mean now, mamma,' said Harry.  `Some animal has\r\ndone this--but what one?  The beavers cannot climb; and I am sure\r\nneither squirrels, raccoons, nor opossums, would take the bark from\r\ntrees in that manner.'\r\n\r\n\"`No; it was none of them.  Your papa can best inform you what sort of\r\nanimal has been so destructive to these young trees, which, you\r\nperceive, are of the beautiful cotton-wood species,--the _populus\r\nangulatus_ of botanists.'\r\n\r\n\"`Come, Harry,' said I, `let us first find the animal if we can.'\r\n\r\n\"We all turned toward the leafless grove.  We had not walked many steps\r\nin that direction, when the very animal we were in search of appeared on\r\nthe ground before us.  It was quite three feet long, thick, broad in the\r\nback, and arched from the nose to the tail.  It was of a speckled grey\r\ncolour, but with the roughest coat of hair that could possibly be\r\nimagined.  Its head and nose were very small for the size of its body;\r\nand its short, stout legs, with their long claws, were scarcely visible\r\nunder the thick, shaggy hair.  Its ears were also buried under the hair;\r\nand it looked more like a round tufted mass than an animal.  It was down\r\nupon the ground; and had evidently perceived our approach, as it was\r\nmaking off through the grass as fast as it could.  That, however, was\r\nnot very fast--not faster than a frog could go--for the animal in\r\nquestion is one of the very slowest travellers.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I caught sight of it, and saw that it was upon the ground--\r\nand not among the branches, where I had expected to find it--I turned\r\nround to secure the dogs.  I was too late, for these unreasoning animals\r\nhad already seen it, and, forgetful of the lesson which the skunk had\r\ntaught them, were dashing forward in full cry.  I endeavoured to call\r\nthem off; but, heedless of our shouts, both rushed on the strange\r\ncreature at once.  The latter, seeing them approach, immediately\r\nstopped, buried its head under its breast, seemed suddenly to swell\r\nupward and outward to twice its natural size--while its rough thick tail\r\nwas brandished from side to side in a furious and threatening manner.\r\n\r\n\"We could all now see that that which had appeared to be coarse thick\r\nhair was nothing else than long bristling spines, and Harry at once\r\ncried out,--\r\n\r\n\"`A porcupine! a porcupine!'\r\n\r\n\"The dogs, unfortunately for themselves, did not know what it was; nor\r\ndid they stop to consider, but lashed upon it open-mouthed, as they\r\nusually do with any strange animal.  They did not hold it long; for the\r\nnext moment they dropped it, and came running back more open-mouthed\r\nthan ever--uttering the most piteous howls--and we saw that their noses,\r\nlips, and jaws, were sticking full of the sharp quills!  Meanwhile the\r\nporcupine again stretched himself out; and, crawling to the foot of a\r\ntree, commenced climbing up.  But Cudjo, who was highly incensed with\r\nthe treatment which his favourites had received, rushed after; and,\r\nknocking down the animal with his spear, soon despatched him.\r\n\r\n\"Harry, who had grown much wiser since his adventure with the skunk, was\r\nrather shy of approaching the porcupine--particularly as he had heard\r\nthat this animal possesses the power of shooting his quills to some\r\ndistance, and sticking them like arrows into his enemies.  Frank\r\ninquired if this were true.\r\n\r\n\"`No,' I replied; `it is only one of those fabulous stories which the\r\ningenious French naturalist, Buffon, so much delighted to recount.  The\r\nporcupine's quills may be pulled out easily by anything which presses\r\ntoo rudely against them, such as the mouth of a mastiff; and this\r\nbecause they are very slightly attached by their roots, and have a barb\r\nupon their tops that takes hold upon any enemy that may attempt to touch\r\nthem.  This is the only defence the poor animal has got--as it is so\r\nslow of foot that any of its enemies can easily come up with it.  But,\r\nnotwithstanding its slowness, most of the fierce creatures find it\r\nbetter to leave the porcupine to himself, and his innocent occupation of\r\n\"barking\" the trees.  He generally proves more than a match for any of\r\nthem; and, in fact, neither wolf, panther, nor wildcat, can kill him--as\r\nthere is not a spot of his body which they can touch when he prepares\r\nhimself for their attack.  On the other hand, he frequently kills them--\r\nonly in self-defence, however, as he never attacks any animal, but lives\r\naltogether on his simple food, the bark and leaves of trees.  The cougar\r\nis often found dead in the woods,--his death occasioned by the\r\nporcupine's quills that are seen sticking in his mouth and tongue.  So\r\nalso the lynx has been found, as well as many dogs and wolves.'\r\n\r\n\"So much of the natural history of this strange animal I related to my\r\ncompanions at the time; but, shortly after, an incident was witnessed by\r\nHarry and myself which showed us that the porcupine, notwithstanding his\r\nbristling armour, had one enemy, at least, who could master him upon\r\noccasions.  Although it occurred some months after our fishing\r\nexcursion, now that we are speaking of the porcupine, I shall relate\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY ONE.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE MARTEN AND PORCUPINE.\r\n\r\n\"It was in the middle of the winter.  A light snow had fallen upon the\r\nground--just enough to enable us to follow the trail of any animal we\r\nmight light upon.  Of course, the snow filled us with the idea of\r\nhunting; and Harry and I started out upon the tracks of a brace of elk\r\nthat had passed through our opening during the night.  The tracks were\r\nvery fresh-looking; and it was evident that the animals had passed in\r\nthe morning, just before we were up.  We concluded, therefore, that they\r\nhad not gone far off, and we hoped soon to come up with them.\r\n\r\n\"The trail led us along the side of the lake, and then, up the left bank\r\nof the stream.  Castor and Pollux were with us; but in our hunting\r\nexcursions we usually led them in a leash, so that they might not\r\nfrighten the game by running ahead of us.\r\n\r\n\"When about half a mile from the house, we found that the elk had\r\ncrossed to the right bank of the stream.  We were about to follow, when,\r\nall at once, our eyes fell upon a most singular track or tracks that led\r\noff in the direction of the woods.  They were _the tracks of human\r\nfeet--the feet of children_!\r\n\r\n\"You may fancy the surprise into which we were suddenly thrown.  They\r\nwere about five inches in length, and exactly such as would have been\r\nmade by a barefooted urchin of six years old.  There appeared to be two\r\nsets of them, as if two children had passed, following one another on\r\nthe same trail.  What could it mean?  After all, were there human beings\r\nin the valley besides ourselves?  Could these be the footprints of two\r\nyoung Indians?  All at once I thought of the Diggers--the _Yamparicos_--\r\nthe root-eaters,--who are found in almost every hole and corner of the\r\nAmerican Desert.  Could it be possible that a family of these wretched\r\ncreatures existed in the valley?  `Quite possible,' thought I, when I\r\nreflected upon their habits.  Living upon roots, insects, and\r\nreptiles,--burrowing in holes and caves like the wild animals around\r\nthem,--a family, or more, might have been living all this time in some\r\nunexplored corner of the valley, without our having encountered any\r\ntraces of them!  Was this really so? and were the tracks before us the\r\nfootmarks of a brace of young Diggers, who had been passing from point\r\nto point?\r\n\r\n\"Of course, our elk-hunt was given up until this mystery should be\r\nsolved; and we turned off from the trail of the latter to follow that of\r\nthe children.\r\n\r\n\"In coming out to an open place, where the snow lay smoothly, and the\r\nfootprints appeared well defined, I stooped down to examine them more\r\nminutely, in order to be satisfied that they _were_ the tracks of human\r\nfeet.  Sure enough, there were the heels, the regular widening of the\r\nfoot near the toes, and the toes themselves, all plainly stamped upon\r\nthe snow.  Here, however, arose another mystery.  On counting the toes,\r\nI found that in some of the tracks there were five--as there should have\r\nbeen,--while in others there were only four!  This led me to examine the\r\nprint of the toes more carefully; and I now saw that each of them was\r\narmed with a claw, which, on account of some hairy covering, had made\r\nbut a very indefinite impression in the snow.  The tracks, then, were\r\n_not_ the footmarks of children, but those of some animal with claws.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding that we had come to this conclusion, we still continued\r\nto follow the trail.  We were curious to see what sort of a creature had\r\nmade it.  Perhaps it might be some animal unknown to naturalists,--some\r\nnew species; and we might one day have the merit of being the first to\r\ndescribe it.\r\n\r\n\"We had not far to go: a hundred yards, or so, brought us in sight of a\r\ngrove of young cotton-woods; and these we saw at a glance were `barked'\r\nby a porcupine.  The whole mystery was cleared up,--we had been\r\nfollowing in the trail of this animal.\r\n\r\n\"I now remembered that the porcupine was one of the _plantigrade_\r\nfamily, with five toes on his hind feet, and only four on the fore ones.\r\nThe tracks were undoubtedly his.\r\n\r\n\"My companion and I were somewhat chagrined at being thus drawn away\r\nfrom our hunt by such an insignificant object; and we vowed to take\r\nvengeance upon the porcupine as soon as we should set our eyes upon him.\r\nWe were not long in doing this,--for as we stole quietly forward, we\r\ncaught sight of a shaggy animal moving among the branches of a tree\r\nabout fifty yards ahead of us.  It was he, of course.  At the same\r\nmoment, however, another animal `hove in sight,' in appearance as\r\ndifferent from the porcupine as a bull from a blue-bottle.\r\n\r\n\"This creature--tail and all--was not less than a yard and a quarter in\r\nlength, and yet its body was not thicker than the upper part of a man's\r\narm.  Its head was broad and somewhat flattened, with short, erect ears,\r\nand pointed nose.  It was bearded like a cat, although the face had more\r\nof the dog in its expression.  Its legs were short and strong; and both\r\nlegs and body denoted the possession of agility and strength.  It was of\r\na reddish-brown colour, with a white mark on the breast, and darker\r\nalong the back and on the legs, feet, nose, and tail.  Its whole\r\nappearance reminded one of a gigantic weasel--which in fact it was--the\r\ngreat marten of America, generally, though improperly, called the\r\n`fisher.'  When we first saw it, it was crouching along a high log, that\r\nran directly toward the tree, upon which was the porcupine.  Its eyes\r\nwere fixed intently upon the latter; and it was evidently meditating an\r\nattack.  We stopped to watch it.\r\n\r\n\"The porcupine had not yet perceived his enemy, as he was busily engaged\r\nin splitting the bark from the cotton-wood.  The marten, after\r\nreconnoitring him for some moments, sprang off from the log, and came\r\nrunning toward the tree.  The other now saw him; and at the same instant\r\nuttered a sort of shrill, querulous cry, and appeared to be greatly\r\naffrighted.  To our astonishment, however, instead of remaining where it\r\nwas, it suddenly dropped to the ground almost at the very nose of its\r\nadversary!  I could not at first understand the meaning of this artful\r\nmovement on the part of the porcupine, but a moment's reflection\r\nconvinced me it was sound policy.  The marten would have been as much at\r\nhome on the tree as himself; and had he remained among the branches--\r\nwhich were slender ones--his throat and the under part of his body--both\r\nof which are soft and without quills--would have been exposed to the\r\nteeth of his adversary.  This, then, was why he had let himself down so\r\nunexpectedly; and we noticed that the instant he touched the ground, he\r\nrolled himself into a round clew, presenting on all sides the formidable\r\n_chevaux-de-frise_ of his quills.\r\n\r\n\"The marten now ran around him, doubling his long vermiform body with\r\ngreat activity--at intervals showing his teeth, erecting his back, and\r\nsnarling like a cat.  We expected every moment to see him spring forward\r\nupon his victim; but he did not do so.  He evidently understood the\r\nperil of such an act; and appeared for a moment puzzled as to how he\r\nshould proceed.  All this while, the porcupine lay quiet--except the\r\ntail.  This was, in fact, the only `feature' of the animal that could be\r\nseen, as the head and feet were completely hidden under the body.  The\r\ntail, however, was kept constantly in motion--jerking from side to side,\r\nand flirted occasionally upwards.\r\n\r\n\"What would the marten do?  There was not an inch of the other's body\r\nthat was not defended by the sharp and barbed quills--not a spot where\r\nhe could insert the tip of his nose.  Would he abandon the contest?  So\r\nthought we, for a while; but we were soon convinced of our error.\r\n\r\n\"After running around several times, as we have described, he at length\r\nposted himself near the hind-quarters of the porcupine, and with his\r\nnose a few inches from the tail of the latter.  In this position he\r\nstood for some moments, apparently watching the tail, which still\r\ncontinued to oscillate rapidly.  He stood in perfect silence, and\r\nwithout making a movement.\r\n\r\n\"The porcupine, not being able to see him, and perhaps thinking that he\r\nwas gone, now waved his tail more slowly; and then suffered it to drop\r\nmotionless.\r\n\r\n\"This was what the other was waiting for; and, the next moment, he had\r\nseized the tail in his teeth.  We saw that he held it by the tip, where\r\nit is destitute of the thorny spines.\r\n\r\n\"What would he do next?  Was he going to bite off the end of the\r\nporcupine's tail?  No such thing.  He had a game different from that to\r\nplay--as we soon witnessed.\r\n\r\n\"The moment the marten caught the tail, the porcupine uttered its\r\nquerulous cries; but the other heeding not these, commenced walking\r\nbackward, dragging his victim after him.  Where was he dragging it to?\r\nWe soon saw.  He was pulling it to a tree, close by, with low branches\r\nthat forked out near the ground.  But for what purpose? thought we.  We\r\nwondered as we watched.\r\n\r\n\"The porcupine could offer no resistance.  Its feet gave way, and\r\nslipped along the snowy ground; for the marten was evidently the much\r\nstronger animal.\r\n\r\n\"In a short time, the latter had reached the tree, having pulled the\r\nother along with him to its foot.  He now commenced ascending, still\r\nholding the porcupine's tail in his teeth; taking good care not to brush\r\ntoo closely against the quills.  `Surely,' thought we, `he cannot climb\r\nup, carrying a body almost as big as himself!'  It was not his intention\r\nto climb up--only to one of the lowermost branches--and the next moment\r\nhe had reached it, stretching his long body out on the limb, and\r\nclutching it firmly with his cat-like claws.  He still held fast hold of\r\nthe porcupine which was now lifted into such a position, that only its\r\nforequarters rested on the ground, and it appeared to stand upon its\r\nhead--all the while uttering its pitiful cries.\r\n\r\n\"For the life of us, we could not guess what the marten meant by all\r\nthis manoeuvring.  _He_ knew well enough, as he gave proof the moment\r\nafter.  When he had got the other as it were on a balance, he suddenly\r\nsprang back to the ground, in such a direction that the impetus of his\r\nleap jerked the porcupine upon its back.  Before the clumsy creature was\r\nable to turn over and `clew' itself, the active weasel had pounced upon\r\nits belly, and buried his claws in the soft flesh, while, at the same\r\ntime, his teeth were made fast in its throat!\r\n\r\n\"In vain the porcupine struggled.  The weasel rode him with such\r\nagility, that he was unable to get right side up again; and in a few\r\nmoments the struggle would have ended, by the porcupine's throat being\r\ncut; but we saw that it was time for us to interfere; and, slipping\r\nCastor and Pollux from the leash, we ran forward.\r\n\r\n\"The dogs soon drove the marten from his victim, but he did not run from\r\nthem.  On the contrary, he turned round upon them, keeping both at bay\r\nwith his sharp teeth and fierce snarling.  In truth, they would have had\r\na very tough job of it, had we not been near; but, on seeing us\r\napproach, the animal took to a tree, running up it like a squirrel.  A\r\nrifle bullet soon brought him down again; and his long body lay\r\nstretched out on the earth, emitting a strong odour of musk, that was\r\nquite disagreeable.\r\n\r\n\"On returning to the porcupine--which our dogs took care not to meddle\r\nwith--we found the animal already better than half-dead.  The blood was\r\nrunning from its throat, which the marten had torn open.  Of course, we\r\nput the creature out of pain by killing it outright; and taking the\r\nmarten along with us for the purpose of skinning it, we returned\r\nhomeward, leaving the elk-hunt for another day.\r\n\r\n\"All this, as I have said, occurred afterwards.  Let us now return to\r\nthe narrative of our fishing excursion.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the porcupine had been disposed of, we were reminded of the\r\nsufferings of our dogs, who had ceased their howling, but required to be\r\nrelieved of the barbed spines with which their lips were sticking full.\r\nWe drew them out as easily as we could; but, notwithstanding this, their\r\nheads began to swell up to twice the natural size, and the poor brutes\r\nappeared to be in great pain.  They were fairly punished for their\r\ninconsiderate rashness; and it was not likely that they would run their\r\nnoses against another porcupine for some time to come.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY TWO.\r\n\r\nTHE CUNNING OLD \"'COON.\"\r\n\r\n\"We now continued our journey toward our fishing-ground, Cudjo having\r\nhung the porcupine to a tree, with the design of taking it home with him\r\non our return.  It was Cudjo's intention to skin it, and eat part or the\r\nwhole of it,--a species of food, which he assured us, he had often eaten\r\nbefore, and which tasted equal to young pig.  None of us were likely to\r\njoin Cudjo in such a meal; but at all events, thought we, when the\r\nquills and skin are removed, our dogs might get a morsel of it as a\r\nreward for their sufferings.  This was an object, certainly; as, out of\r\nour scanty larder, Castor and Pollux did not fare the best sometimes.\r\n\r\n\"We soon arrived upon the bank of the creek, and close to the pool.\r\nThis was a long stretch of deep dark water, with a high bank on one\r\nside, shadowed over with leafy trees.  On the opposite side, the bank\r\nwas low, and shelved down to the edge--while several logs lay along it,\r\nhalf covered with water, and half of them stretching up against the\r\nbank.\r\n\r\n\"We took the high bank for our station, as upon this there was a spot of\r\nsmooth grassy turf, shaded by beautiful palmetto-trees, where the\r\nchildren could tumble about.  Here Mary sat down with them, while the\r\nrest of us proceeded to fish.  Of course, we could do no more than throw\r\nin our lines, and then wait until the fish should be fools enough to\r\nbite.  We conversed very quietly, lest the noise of our talking should\r\nfrighten the fish--though this was only an imagination of our own.  We\r\nhad not been watching our floats more than five minutes, when we\r\nnoticed, here and there, a slight stir in the water; and, in the midst\r\nof the little circles thus made, we could see small black objects not\r\nunlike the heads of snakes.  At first we took them for these.  Cudjo,\r\nhowever, knew better than we what they were, for he had often seen them\r\nwhile fishing in the creeks of Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"`Golly, Massa!' cried he, as soon as they made their appearance, `de\r\ncreek here am full ob de turtle.'\r\n\r\n\"`Turtles!' exclaimed Harry.\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, Massa Harry,' replied Cudjo; `and as dis nigger lib, de am de\r\nreal soff-shell turtle!  Dat's de meat for dis child Cudjo,--better dan\r\nfish, flesh, fowl, or 'possum,--dat am de soff-shell.'\r\n\r\n\"As Cudjo spoke, one of the turtles `bobbed' up nearly under where we\r\nsat; and, from the elongated shape of its head, resembling a snout, and\r\nthe flexible shell that bent up and down along its edges, as he swam, I\r\nsaw it was a species of _trionyx_, or soft-shelled turtle,--in fact, it\r\nwas that known as _trionyx ferox_, the most prized of all the turtle\r\nrace for the table of the epicure.  Here, then, was another luxury for\r\nus, as soon as we could catch them.\r\n\r\n\"I turned round; and was on the point of asking Cudjo how this could be\r\naccomplished, when I saw that my float went suddenly down, and I felt a\r\npull upon the line.  I thought, of course, it was a fish, and commenced\r\nhandling it; but, to my surprise, on bringing it to the surface, I\r\nperceived that I had hooked one of the turtles, and no doubt the same\r\none which had looked up at us but a moment before.  He was not a very\r\nlarge one; and we soon landed him; when Cudjo secured him simply by\r\nturning him over upon his back.  As I learnt from Cudjo, these creatures\r\nwill eagerly bite at anything that may be thrown into the water and\r\nappears strange to them.  Of the truth of this we had a curious\r\ndemonstration shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\n\"In a few minutes more, each of us had taken several good-sized fish;\r\nand we still continued watching our rods in silence, when our attention\r\nwas attracted to the movements of an animal upon the opposite bank, and\r\nabout one hundred yards below where we sat.  We were all well acquainted\r\nwith this animal; and Harry, the moment he saw it, whispered,--\r\n\r\n\"`Look, papa! mamma! a 'coon!'\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was a raccoon.  There was no mistaking the broad dark-brown\r\nback, the sharp fox-looking face and snout, and the long bushy tail,\r\nwith its alternate rings of black and yellowish white.  The short thick\r\nlegs, the erect ears, and the white and black marks of the face, were\r\nfamiliar to all of us--for the raccoon is one of the best-known animals\r\nin America, and we had it among our pets.\r\n\r\n\"At the sight of the `'coon,' Cudjo's eyes fairly glistened--for there\r\nis no animal that affords so much sport to the negroes of the United\r\nStates as the 'coon; and he is, therefore, to them as interesting a\r\ncreature as the fox to the red-coated hunters of England.  Hunting the\r\nraccoon is one of the principal amusements which the poor slave enjoys,\r\nin the beautiful moonlight nights of the Southern States, after he has\r\ngot free from his hard toil.  By them, too, the flesh of the 'coon is\r\neaten, although it is not esteemed much of a dainty.  The 'possum is\r\nheld in far higher estimation.  Cudjo's eyes then glistened as soon as\r\nhe set them upon his old and familiar victim.\r\n\r\n\"The 'coon all this while had seen none of us, else he would soon have\r\nwidened the distance between us and himself.  He was crawling cautiously\r\nalong the bank of the creek, now hopping up on a log, and now stopping\r\nfor a while, and looking earnestly into the water.\r\n\r\n\"`De ole 'coon go to fish,' whispered Cudjo; `dat's what he am after.'\r\n\r\n\"`Fish!' said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, Massa Harry.  He fish for de turtle.'\r\n\r\n\"`And how will he catch them?' inquired Harry.\r\n\r\n\"`Golly, Massa Harry, he catch 'em.  Wait, you see.'\r\n\r\n\"We all sat quietly watching his manoeuvres, and curious to witness how\r\nhe would catch the turtles; for none of us, with the exception of Cudjo,\r\nknew how.  We knew that it was not likely he would leap at them in the\r\nwater, for these animals can dive as quickly as a fish; besides they can\r\nbite very severely, and would be sure to take a piece out of the 'coon's\r\nskin, should he attack them in their own element.  But that was not his\r\nintention, as we presently saw.  Near the end of one of the logs that\r\nprotruded into the water, we observed the heads of several turtles\r\nmoving about on the surface.  The raccoon saw them also, for he was\r\nstealthily approaching this log with his eyes fixed upon the swimming\r\nreptiles.  On reaching it, he climbed upon it with great silence and\r\ncaution.  He then placed his head between his fore-legs; and, turning\r\nhis tail toward the creek, commenced crawling down the log,\r\ntail-foremost.  He proceeded slowly, bit by bit, until his long bushy\r\ntail hung over into the water, where he caused it to move gently\r\nbackwards and forwards.  His body was rolled up into a sort of clew,\r\nuntil one could not have told what sort of a creature was upon the log.\r\n\r\n\"He had not remained many moments in this attitude, when one of the\r\nturtles, swimming about, caught sight of the moving tail; and, attracted\r\npartly by curiosity, and partly in hopes of getting something to eat,\r\napproached, and seized hold of the long hair in his horny mandibles.\r\nBut he had scarce caught it, before the 'coon unwound himself upon the\r\nlog; and, at the same time, with a sudden and violent jerk of his tail,\r\nplucked the turtle out of the water, and flung him high and dry upon the\r\nbank!  Then following after, in three springs, he was beside his victim,\r\nwhich with his long sharp nose he immediately turned over upon its\r\nback--taking care all the while to avoid coming in contact with the\r\nbill-like snout of the turtle.  The latter was now at the mercy of the\r\n'coon, who was proceeding to demolish him in his usual fashion; but\r\nCudjo could stand it no longer, and away went he and the dogs, with loud\r\nshouts, across the creek.\r\n\r\n\"The chase was not a long one, for in a few seconds the steady barking\r\nof the dogs told us that poor `coony' was `treed.'  Unfortunately, for\r\nhimself, he had run up a very low tree, where Cudjo was able to reach\r\nhim with his long spear; and when the rest of us got forward to the\r\nspot, we found that Cudjo had finished him, and was holding him up by\r\nthe tail, quite dead.\r\n\r\n\"We now went back to our fishing; and although we caught no more of the\r\nturtles, we succeeded in taking as many fish as we wanted; and returning\r\nto the house, Mary cooked for us a most excellent fish dinner, which we\r\nall ate with a keen appetite.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY THREE.\r\n\r\nLITTLE MARY AND THE BEE.\r\n\r\n\"During the winter we saw very little of our beavers.  Through the cold\r\nseason they lay snug in their houses--although not in a state of\r\ntorpidity, as the beaver does not become torpid in winter.  He only\r\nkeeps within doors, and spends most of his time in eating and sleeping;\r\nbut he goes out of his house at intervals to wash and clean himself, for\r\nthe beaver is an animal of very precise habits.  He is not compelled,\r\nhowever, to go abroad in search of food.  As we have seen, he lays up a\r\nstock which serves him throughout the cold season.\r\n\r\n\"For several weeks in mid-winter, the dam was frozen over with ice\r\nstrong enough to bear our weight; and we visited the houses of the\r\nbeavers that stood up like so many hay-stacks.  We found them so hard\r\nand firm, that we could climb upon them, and pounce down upon their\r\ntops, without the least danger of breaking them in.  In fact, it would\r\nhave been anything but an easy task to have opened one of them from\r\nabove; and no animal--not even the wolverene with his crooked claws,--\r\ncould have done it.  We observed that in every case the doors were far\r\nbelow the ice, so that the entrance still remained open to the animals\r\nwithin; and, moreover, when any one stamped heavily upon the roof,\r\nthrough the clear ice we could see the frightened creatures making their\r\nescape by darting off into the water.  Sometimes we remained to see if\r\nthey would return, but in no instance did they come back.  At the time\r\nwe wondered at this--as we knew they could not possibly live under the\r\nice, where there was no air.  We soon found, however, that these cunning\r\ncreatures knew what they were about; and that they had already provided\r\nmeans to escape from the danger of being drowned.\r\n\r\n\"Along one side of the dam there was a bank, that rose considerably\r\nabove the water; and into this bank they had made large holes, or as\r\nthey are termed `washes.'  These were so constructed that the entrances\r\nto them could not be frozen up; and we found that whenever the beavers\r\nwere disturbed or frightened from their houses, they invariably betook\r\nthemselves to these washes, where they could crawl quietly up above the\r\nsurface of the water, and breathe in safety!\r\n\r\n\"This was the proper season to trap the beaver, as their fur is more\r\nvaluable in winter than at any other time; but, as I have already said,\r\nit was not our intention to disturb them, until they should become very\r\nnumerous.\r\n\r\n\"The ice upon the dam was exceedingly smooth, and of course suggested\r\nthe idea of skates.  Both Frank and Harry were very fond of this\r\namusement, and, indeed, I was rather partial to it myself.\r\n\r\n\"Skates then must be had, at all cost, and again we had recourse to the\r\n_bois d'arc_, the wood of which was sufficiently light and compact for\r\nour purpose Cudjo, with his hammer and a good hickory-fire, soon drew\r\nout the shoeing for them, making it very thin--as our stock of iron\r\nconsisted in what we had taken from the body of the wagon, and was of\r\ncourse very precious, and not to be wasted upon articles designed merely\r\nfor amusement.  However, we knew it would not be lost upon the skates;\r\nas we could take it from them, whenever we should want to apply it to a\r\nmore useful purpose.  In a short time, we had three pairs; and,\r\nstrapping them firmly to our feet with strips of deerskin, were soon\r\ngliding over the dam, and spinning around the beaver-houses--no doubt to\r\nthe great wonderment of such of the animals as came out under the ice to\r\nlook at us.  Mary, with Cudjo and the children, stood watching us from\r\nthe shore, and clapping their hands with delight.\r\n\r\n\"With these and such-like innocent recreations, we passed the winter\r\nvery agreeably.  It was but a very short winter; and as soon as the\r\nspring returned, Cudjo, with his wooden plough, turned up our little\r\nfield, and we planted our corn.  It occupied nearly an acre of ground;\r\nand we had now the pleasant prospect that, in six weeks' time, we should\r\ngather about fifty bushels.  We did not neglect our hundred grains of\r\nwheat, but sowed that carefully in a corner by itself.  You may fancy\r\nthat it did not take up much ground.  Mary had also her garden, with\r\nbeds of wild potatoes, and other roots, which she had discovered in the\r\nvalley.  One of these was the species of turnip already mentioned as the\r\n_pomme-blanche_, or Indian turnip.  She had found wild onions too, which\r\nproved of great service in soup-making.  In her garden were many others\r\nof which I only know the names; but three of them, the `kamas,' the\r\n`kooyah,' and `yampah' roots are worth mentioning, as thousands of the\r\nmiserable Indians who inhabit the American Desert subsist chiefly on\r\nthem.  The widely scattered tribes known as the `Diggers,' take their\r\nname from the fact of their digging for, and living upon, these roots.\r\n\r\n\"The flowers now came out in full bloom; and some of the openings near\r\nthe upper end of the valley were a sight to behold.  They were literally\r\ncovered with beautiful blossoms--_malvas, cleomes, asclepiae_, and\r\n_helianthi_.  We frequently visited this part, making pic-nic excursions\r\nto all the places of note in our little dominion.  The cataract where\r\nthe stream dashed over the cliff, the salt spring, and such-like places,\r\nformed points of interest; and we rarely failed in any of these\r\nexcursions to draw some useful lesson from the school of Nature.\r\nIndeed, Mary and I frequently designed them, for the purpose of\r\ninstructing our children in such of the natural sciences as we ourselves\r\nknew.  We had no books, and we illustrated our teachings by the objects\r\naround us.\r\n\r\n\"One day we had strayed up as usual among the openings.  It was very\r\nearly in the spring, just as the flowers were beginning to appear.  We\r\nhad sat down to rest ourselves in the middle of a glade, surrounded by\r\nbeautiful magnolias.  There was a bed of large blue flowers close by;\r\nand Frank, taking little Mary by the hand, had gone in among them to\r\ngather a bouquet for his mother.  All at once the child uttered a\r\nscream, and then continued to cry loudly!  Had she been bitten by a\r\nsnake?  Alarmed at the thought, we all started to our feet, and ran for\r\nthe spot.  The little creature still cried--holding out her hand, which\r\nwe at once perceived was the seat of the pain.  The cause of it was\r\nevident--she had been stung by a bee.  No doubt she had clasped a\r\nflower, upon which some bee had been making his honey, and the angry\r\ninsect had punished such a rude interference with his pleasures.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the child had been pacified by a soothing application to the\r\nwound, a train of reflection occurred to the minds of all of us.  `There\r\nare bees, then, in the place,' said we.  We had not known this fact\r\nbefore.  In the autumn previous we had been too busy with other things\r\nto notice them; and of course during the winter season they were not to\r\nbe seen.  They were just now coming out for the early spring flowers.\r\n\r\n\"It was natural to infer, that where there were bees there should also\r\nbe honey; and the word `honey' had a magic sound in the ears of our\r\nlittle community.  Bees and honey now became the topic of conversation;\r\nand not a sentence was uttered for some minutes that did not contain an\r\nallusion to bees or bees' nests, or bee-trees, or bee-hunters, or honey.\r\n\r\n\"We all scattered among the flowers to assure ourselves that it really\r\nwas a bee, and not some rascally wasp that had wounded our little Mary.\r\nIf it was a bee, we should find some of his companions roaming about\r\namong the blossoms of the helianthus.\r\n\r\n\"In a short time Harry was heard crying out, `A bee!--a bee!' and almost\r\nat the same instant Frank shouted, `Another!'  `Hya--hya!' cried Cudjo,\r\n`yar's de oder one--see 'im!--biz-z-z.  Gollies! how he am loaded with\r\nde wax!'\r\n\r\n\"Two or three others were now discovered, all busily plying their\r\nindustrious calling; and proving that there was one hive, at least, in\r\nsome part of the valley.\r\n\r\n\"The question now arose, how this hive was to be found?  No doubt it was\r\nin some hollow tree--but how were we to find this tree, standing as it\r\nlikely did among hundreds of others, and not differing from the rest in\r\nappearance?  This was the question that puzzled us.\r\n\r\n\"It did not puzzle all of us though.  Fortunately there chanced to be a\r\nbee-hunter among us--a real old bee-hunter, and that individual was our\r\nfamous Cudjo.  Cudjo had `treed' bees many's the time in the woods of\r\n`Ole Vaginny,' and cut down the trees too, and licked the honey--for\r\nCudjo was as sweet upon honey as a bear.  Yes, Cudjo had `treed' bees\r\nmany's the time, and knew how--that did Cudjo.\r\n\r\n\"We should have to return to the house, however, to enable him to make\r\nready his implements; and as the day was now pretty far advanced, we\r\ndetermined to leave our bee-hunting for the morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nA GRAND BEE-HUNT.\r\n\r\n\"Next day we had a warm, sunshiny day--just such an one as would bring\r\nthe bees out.  After breakfast we all set forth for the openings, in\r\nhigh spirits at the prospect of the sport we should have.  Harry was\r\nmore eager than any of us.  He had heard a good deal about bee-hunters;\r\nand was very desirous of knowing how they pursued their craft.  He could\r\neasily understand that, when a bee-tree was once found, it could be cut\r\ndown with an axe and split open, and the honey taken from it.  All this\r\nwould be very easily done.  But how were bee-trees found?  That was the\r\npuzzle; for, as I have before observed, these trees do not differ in\r\nappearance from others around them; and the hole by which the bees enter\r\nis usually so high up, that one cannot see these little insects from the\r\nground.  One might tell it to be a bee's nest, if his attention were\r\ncalled to it; for the bark around the entrance, like that of the\r\nsquirrel's, is always discoloured, in consequence of the bees alighting\r\nupon it with their moist feet.  But then one may travel a long while\r\nthrough the woods before chancing to notice this.  Bee-trees are\r\nsometimes found by accident; but the regular bee-hunter does not depend\r\nupon this, else his calling would be a very uncertain one.  There is no\r\naccident in the way he goes to work.  He seeks for the nest, and is\r\nalmost sure to find it--provided the ground be open enough to enable him\r\nto execute his manoeuvres.  I may here remark that, wherever bees take\r\nup their abode, there is generally open tracts in their neighbourhood,\r\nor else flower-bearing trees--since in very thick woods under the deep\r\ndark shadow of the foliage, flowers are more rare, and consequently the\r\nfood of the bees more difficult to be obtained.  These creatures love\r\nthe bright glades and sunny openings, often met with in the\r\nprairie-forests of the wild West.\r\n\r\n\"Well, as I have said, we were all eager to witness how our bee-hunter,\r\nCudjo, would set about finding the bee-tree--for up to this time he had\r\nkept the secret to himself, to the great tantalisation of Harry, whose\r\nimpatience had now reached its maximum of endurance.  The implements\r\nwhich Cudjo had brought along with him--or as he called them, the\r\n`fixins'--were exceedingly simple in their character.  They consisted of\r\na drinking-glass--fortunately we had one that had travelled safely in\r\nour great mess-chest--a cup-full of maple molasses, and a few tufts of\r\nwhite wool taken from the skin of a rabbit.  `How was he going to use\r\nthese things?' thought Harry, and so did we all--for none of us knew\r\nanything of the process, and Cudjo seemed determined to keep quiet about\r\nhis plans, until he should give us a practical illustration of them.\r\n\r\n\"At length we arrived at the glades, and entered one of the largest of\r\nthem, where we halted.  Pompo was taken from the cart, and picketed upon\r\nthe grass; and we all followed Cudjo--observing every movement that he\r\nmade.  Harry's eyes were on him like a lynx, for he feared lest Cudjo\r\nmight go through some part of the operation without his seeing or\r\nunderstanding it.  He watched him, therefore, as closely as if Cudjo had\r\nbeen a conjuror, and was about to perform some trick.  The latter said\r\nnothing, but went silently to work--evidently not a little proud of his\r\npeculiar knowledge, and the interest which he was exciting by it.\r\n\r\n\"There was a dead log near one edge of the opening.  To this the\r\nbee-hunter proceeded; and, drawing out his knife, scraped off a small\r\nportion of the rough bark--so as to render the surface smooth and even.\r\nOnly a few square inches of the log were thus polished and levelled.\r\nThat would be enough for his purpose.  Upon the spot thus prepared, he\r\npoured out a quantity of the molasses--a small quantity, forming a\r\nlittle circle about the size of a penny piece.  He next took the glass,\r\nand wiped it with the skirt of his coat until it was as clear as a\r\ndiamond.  He then proceeded among the flowers in search of a bee.\r\n\r\n\"One was soon discovered nestling upon the blossom of a helianthus.\r\nCudjo approached it stealthily, and with an adroit movement inverted the\r\nglass upon it, so as to inclose both bee and flower; at the same instant\r\none of his hands--upon which was a strong buckskin glove--was slipped\r\nunder the mouth of the glass, to prevent the bee from getting out; and,\r\nnipping the flower stalk between his fingers, he bore off both the bee\r\nand the blossom.\r\n\r\n\"On arriving at the log, the flower was taken out of the glass by a\r\ndexterous movement, and thrown away.  The bee still remained, buzzing up\r\nagainst the bottom of the glass--which, of course, was now the top, for\r\nCudjo had held it all the while inverted on his palm.  The glass was\r\nthen set upon the log, mouth downwards, so as to cover the little spot\r\nof molasses; and it was thus left, while we all stood around to watch\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"The bee, still frightened by his captivity, for some time kept circling\r\naround the upper part of the glass--seeking, very naturally, for an\r\negress in that direction.  His whirring wings, however, soon came in\r\ncontact with the top of the vessel; and he was flung down right into the\r\nmolasses.  There was not enough of the `treacle' to hold him fast; but\r\nhaving once tasted of its sweets, he showed no disposition to leave it.\r\nOn the contrary, he seemed to forget all at once that he was a captive;\r\nand thrusting his proboscis into the honeyed liquid, he set about\r\ndrinking it like a good fellow.\r\n\r\n\"Cudjo did not molest him until he had fairly gorged himself; then,\r\ndrawing him gently aside with the rim of the glass, he separated him\r\nfrom his banquet.  He had removed his gloves, and cautiously inserting\r\nhis naked hand he caught the bee--which was now somewhat heavy and\r\nstupid--between his thumb and forefinger.  He then raised it from the\r\nlog; and turning it breast upward, with his other hand he attached a\r\nsmall tuft of the rabbit wool to the legs of the insect.  The glutinous\r\npaste with which its thighs were loaded enabled him to effect this the\r\nmore easily.  The wool, which was exceedingly light, was now `flaxed\r\nout,' in order to make it show as much as possible, while, at the same\r\ntime, it was so arranged as not to come in contact with the wings of the\r\nbee and hinder its flight.  All this did Cudjo with an expertness which\r\nsurprised us, and would have surprised any one who was a stranger to the\r\ncraft of the bee-hunter.  He performed every operation with great\r\nnicety, taking care not to cripple the insect; and, indeed, we did not\r\ninjure it in the least--for Cudjo's fingers, although none of the\r\nsmallest, were as delicate in the touch as those of a fine lady.\r\n\r\n\"When everything was arranged, he placed the bee upon the log again,\r\nlaying it down very gently.\r\n\r\n\"The little creature seemed quite astounded at the odd treatment which\r\nit was receiving; and for a few seconds remained motionless upon the\r\nlog; but a warm sunbeam glancing down upon it soon restored it to its\r\nsenses; and perceiving that it was once more free, it stretched its\r\ntranslucent wings and rose suddenly into the air.  It mounted straight\r\nupward, to a height of thirty or forty feet; and then commenced circling\r\naround, as we could see by the white wool that streamed after it.\r\n\r\n\"It was now that Cudjo's eyes rolled in good earnest.  The pupils seemed\r\nto be dilated to twice their usual size, and the great balls appeared to\r\ntumble about in their sockets, as if there was nothing to hold them.\r\nHis head, too, seemed to revolve, as if his short thick neck had been\r\nsuddenly converted into a well-greased pivot, and endowed with rotatory\r\nmotion!\r\n\r\n\"After making several circles through the air, the insect darted off for\r\nthe woods.  We followed it with our eyes as long as we could; but the\r\nwhite tuft was soon lost in the distance, and we saw no more of it.  We\r\nnoticed that it had gone in a straight line, which the bee always\r\nfollows when returning loaded to his hive--hence an expression often\r\nheard in western America, the `bee-line,' and which has its synonym in\r\nEngland in the phrase, `as the crow flies.'  Cudjo knew it would keep on\r\nin this line, until it had reached the tree where its nest was;\r\nconsequently, he was now in possession of one link in the chain of his\r\ndiscovery--_the direction of the bee-tree from the point where we\r\nstood_.\r\n\r\n\"But would this be enough to enable him to find it?  Evidently not.  The\r\nbee might stop on the very edge of the woods, or it might go twenty\r\nyards beyond, or fifty, or perhaps a quarter of a mile, without coming\r\nto its tree.  It was plain, then, to all of us, that _the line in which\r\nthe tree lay_ was not enough, as without some other guide one might have\r\nsearched along this line for a week without finding the nest.\r\n\r\n\"All this knew Cudjo before; and, of course, he did not stop a moment to\r\nreflect upon it then.  He had carefully noted the direction taken by the\r\ninsect, which he had as carefully `marked' by the trunk of a tree which\r\ngrew on the edge of the glade, and in the line of the bee's flight.\r\nAnother `mark' was still necessary to record the latter, and make things\r\nsure.  To do this, Cudjo stooped down, and with his knife cut an oblong\r\nnotch upon the bark of the log, which pointed lengthwise in the\r\ndirection the bee had taken.  This he executed with great precision.  He\r\nnext proceeded to the tree which he had used as a marker, and `blazed'\r\nit with his axe.\r\n\r\n\"`What next?' thought we.  Cudjo was not long in showing us what was to\r\nbe next.  Another log was selected, at a point, at least two hundred\r\nyards distant from the former one.  A portion of this was scraped in a\r\nsimilar manner, and molasses poured upon the clear spot as before.\r\nAnother bee was caught, imprisoned under the glass, fed, hoppled with\r\nwool, and then let go again.  To our astonishment, this one flew off in\r\na direction nearly opposite to that taken by the former.\r\n\r\n\"`Neber mind,' said Cudjo, `so much de better--two bee-tree better than\r\none.'\r\n\r\n\"Cudjo marked the direction which the latter had taken, precisely as he\r\nhad done with the other.\r\n\r\n\"Without changing the log a third bee was caught and `put through.'\r\nThis one took a new route, different from either of his predecessors.\r\n\r\n\"`Gollies!  Massa!' cried Cudjo, `dis valley am full ob honey.  Three\r\nbee-trees at one stand!' and he again made his record upon the log.\r\n\r\n\"A fourth bee was caught, and, after undergoing the ceremony, let go\r\nagain.  This one evidently belonged to the same hive as the first, for\r\nwe saw that it flew toward the same point in the woods.  The direction\r\nwas carefully noted, as before.  A clue was now found to the whereabouts\r\nof one hive--that of _the first_ and _fourth_ bees.  That was enough for\r\nthe present.  As to the second and third, the records which Cudjo had\r\nmarked against them would stand good for the morrow or any other day;\r\nand he proceeded to complete the `hunt' after the nest of Numbers 1 and\r\n4.\r\n\r\n\"We had all by this time acquired an insight into the meaning of Cudjo's\r\nmanoeuvres, and we were able to assist him.  The exact point where the\r\nbee-tree grew was now determined.  It stood at the point where the two\r\nlines made by bees, Numbers 1 and 4, met each other.  It would be found\r\nat the very apex of this angle--_wherever it was_.  But that was the\r\nnext difficulty--to get at this point.  There would have been no\r\ndifficulty about it, had the ground been open, or so that we could have\r\nseen to a sufficient distance through the woods.  This could have been\r\neasily accomplished by two of us stationing ourselves--one at each of\r\nthe two logs--while a third individual moved along either of the lines.\r\nThe moment this third person should appear on both lines at once, he\r\nwould of course be at the point of intersection; and at this point the\r\nbee-tree would be found.  I shall explain this by a diagram.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose that A and C were the two logs, from which the bees, Numbers 1\r\nand 4, had respectively taken their flight; and suppose A B and C B to\r\nbe the directions in which they had gone.  If they went directly home--\r\nwhich it was to be presumed they both did--they would meet at their nest\r\nat some point B.  This point could not be discovered by seeing the bees\r\nmeeting at it, for they were already lost sight of at short distances\r\nfrom A and C.  But without this, had the ground been clear of timber, we\r\ncould easily have found it in the following manner:--I should have\r\nplaced myself at log A, while Cudjo stationed himself at C.  We should\r\nthen have sent one of the boys--say Harry--along the line A D.  This,\r\nyou must observe, is a _fixed_ line, for D was already a _marked_ point.\r\nAfter reaching D, Harry should continue on, keeping in the same line.\r\nThe moment, therefore, that he came under the eye of Cudjo--who would be\r\nall this while glancing along C E, also a fixed line--he would then be\r\non both lines at once, and consequently at their point of intersection.\r\nThis, by all the laws of bee-hunting, would be the place to find the\r\nnest; and, as I have said, we could easily have found it thus, had it\r\nnot been for the trees.  But these intercepted our view, and therein lay\r\nthe difficulty; for the moment Harry should have passed the point D,\r\nwhere the underwood began, he would have been lost to our sight, and, of\r\ncourse, of no farther use in establishing the point B.\r\n\r\n\"For myself, I could not see clearly how this difficulty was to be got\r\nover--as the woods beyond D and E were thick and tangled.  The thing was\r\nno puzzle to Cudjo, however.  He knew a way of finding B, and the\r\nbee-tree as well, and he went about it at once.\r\n\r\n\"Placing one of the boys at the station A, so that he could see him over\r\nthe grass, he shouldered his axe, and moved off along the line A D.  He\r\nentered the woods at D, and kept on until he had found a tree from which\r\nboth A and D were visible, and which lay exactly in _the same line_.\r\nThis tree he `blazed.'  He then moved a little farther, and blazed\r\nanother, and another--all on the continuation of the line A D--until we\r\ncould hear him chopping away at a good distance in the woods.  Presently\r\nhe returned to the point E; and, calling to one of us to stand for a\r\nmoment at C, he commenced `blazing' backwards, on the continuation of C\r\nE.  We now joined him--as our presence at the logs was no longer\r\nnecessary to his operations.\r\n\r\n\"At a distance of about two hundred yards from the edge of the glade,\r\nthe blazed lines were seen to approach each other.  There were several\r\nvery large trees at this point.  Cudjo's `instinct' told him, that in\r\none of these the bees had their nest.  He flung down his axe at length,\r\nand rolled his eyes upwards.  We all took part in the search, and gazed\r\nup, trying to discover the little insects that, no doubt, were winging\r\ntheir way among the high branches.\r\n\r\n\"In a few moments, however, a loud and joyful exclamation from Cudjo\r\nproclaimed that the hunt was over--_the bee-tree was found_!\r\n\r\n\"True enough, there was the nest, or the entrance that led to it, away\r\nhigh up on a giant sycamore.  We could see the discoloration on the bark\r\ncaused by the feet of the bees, and even the little creatures themselves\r\ncrowding out and in.  It was a large tree, with a cavity at the bottom\r\nbig enough to have admitted a full-sized man, and, no doubt, hollow up\r\nto the place where the bees had constructed their nest.\r\n\r\n\"As we had spent many hours in finding it, and the day was now well\r\nadvanced, we concluded to leave farther operations for the morrow, when\r\nwe should fell it, and procure the delicious honey.  With this\r\ndetermination, and well satisfied with our day's amusement, we returned\r\nto our house.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nA RIVAL HONEY-ROBBER.\r\n\r\n\"Now, there were some circumstances to be considered, before we could\r\nproceed any farther in the matter of the bees.  How were we to get at\r\nthe honey?  `Why, by felling the tree, and splitting it open, of\r\ncourse,' you will say.  Well, that would have to be done, too; but there\r\nwas still another consideration.  It is no very difficult matter to fell\r\na tree, and split it up--that is, when one has a good axe--but it is a\r\nvery different affair to take the honey-combs from some eight or ten\r\nthousand bees, every one of them with a sharp sting in his tail.  We had\r\nno brimstone; and if we had had such a thing, they were well out of the\r\nreach of it, while the tree stood; and after it should be felled, we\r\ncould not approach them.  They would then be furious to a certainty.\r\n\r\n\"But Cudjo's knowledge of bee-hunting extended farther than to the mere\r\nfinding of the tree.  He knew, also, how to _humbug_ the bees, and rob\r\nthem of their sweet honey.  That was a part of the performance that\r\nCudjo understood as well as any other.  According to his directions,\r\nthen, two pairs of stout buckskin gloves were prepared.  We chanced to\r\nhave one pair already, and Mary soon stitched up a second, of the kind\r\ngenerally used for weeding thistles--that is, having only a thumb, and a\r\nplace for all the fingers together.  One pair of the gloves Cudjo\r\nintended to use himself--the other was for me.  Of course, the rest were\r\nto take no part in the robbery, but only to stand at a safe distance and\r\nlook on.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to the gloves, a couple of masks were cut out of elk-hide,\r\nand with strings fitted to our faces.  These, with our thick deerskin\r\novercoats, would protect us against the stings of all the bees in\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n\"Thus accoutred, then, or rather taking these articles along with us, we\r\nset out for the bee-tree.  Of course, everybody went as usual.  We took\r\nwith us the axe to cut down the tree, and several vessels to hold the\r\nhoney.\r\n\r\n\"On arriving at the glade, we loosed Pompo out of the cart; and picketed\r\nhim as we had done the day before.  It would not do to bring him any\r\nnearer the scene of action, as the bees might take a fancy to revenge\r\nthemselves by stinging him.  We then took our `fixings' from the cart,\r\nand proceeded to the tree.  In a few moments we stood by its foot.\r\n\r\n\"On looking up we observed that there was an unusual commotion among the\r\nbees.  They were whirring in large numbers around the entrance of their\r\nnest, and swarming out and in.  As the day was very still, we could hear\r\nthem buzzing loudly.  What could it mean?  Were they going to hive?\r\n\r\n\"Cudjo thought not.  It was too early in the season for that.  And yet\r\ntheir actions were strange.  He could not understand it.\r\n\r\n\"`Dey look, Massa,' said he, after gazing at them for some moments, `dey\r\nlook zackly like some varmint war a-vexin' ob 'em.'\r\n\r\n\"So did they, but no `varmint' appeared to be near their hole; and no\r\nanimal, however thick in the skin, would have ventured into it, as we\r\nthought.  The orifice was not over three inches in diameter, and we knew\r\nthat neither squirrel, marten, nor weasel, would have dared to put a\r\nnose into it.  What, then, could have so excited them?\r\n\r\n\"We observed that it was a warm day--the warmest we had had up to that\r\ntime--and, probably, the beat had set them a-going.  With this\r\nexplanation, therefore, in the absence of a better, we remained\r\nsatisfied; and commenced making our preparations to fell the tree.\r\n\r\n\"It was not likely to be a difficult job.  The tree, as I have said, was\r\na hollow one; and near the ground its trunk was nothing but a mere\r\nshell, which we could easily cut through.  So Cudjo went lustily to work\r\nwith his axe; and the white sycamore chips were soon flying in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\"He had hardly made a dozen strokes, when we were startled by a singular\r\nnoise, that sounded something like a `cross' between a growl and a\r\nsnort!\r\n\r\n\"Cudjo immediately suspended his blows; and we all stood gazing at each\r\nother with looks that betokened surprise and terror.  I say _terror_--\r\nfor the noise had something terrible in it; and we knew it could have\r\nproceeded from nothing else than some large and fierce animal.  Whence\r\ndid it come?--from the woods?  We looked anxiously around us, but no\r\nmotion could be observed in the bramble.  The underwood was thin, and we\r\ncould have seen a large animal at some distance, had such been there.\r\n\r\n\"Again the horrid sound echoed in our ears.  It appeared to issue out of\r\nthe earth!  No--_it came out of the tree_!\r\n\r\n\"`Golly!' exclaimed Cudjo, `it am a bar, Massa Roff!  I know him growl.'\r\n\r\n\"`A bear!'  I ejaculated, catching the thought at the same moment.  `A\r\nbear in the bee-tree!  Run, Mary!  Run for the glade!'--and I hurried my\r\nwife and children from the spot.  Harry and Frank both wished to remain\r\nwith their rifles, and I could hardly get them off.  I induced them to\r\ngo, at length, by telling them that they must stay near their mother and\r\nthe little ones, to guard them in case the animal should come that way.\r\nAll this occupied but a few seconds of time, and then Cudjo and I were\r\nleft to ourselves.\r\n\r\n\"It was evident that a bear was up the hollow of the tree, and hence the\r\nflurry among the bees.  Cudjo's axe had disturbed him--he was coming\r\ndown!\r\n\r\n\"What was to be done?  Could we not close up the hole?  No--there was\r\nnothing--we should be too late!\r\n\r\n\"I seized my rifle, while Cudjo stood by with his axe.  I cocked the\r\npiece, and made ready to fire the moment his head should appear.  To our\r\nastonishment, instead of a head, a shapeless mass of shaggy, black hair\r\nmade its appearance, which we saw was the rump and hind-quarters of the\r\nanimal.  He was coming down tail-foremost--although not a bit of tail\r\nwas to be seen, for he had none.\r\n\r\n\"We did not stop to examine that.  I fired as soon as his hips made\r\ntheir appearance, and almost at the same instant Cudjo dealt them a\r\nhearty blow with his axe.  It was enough to have killed him, as we\r\nthought, but to our surprise the hind-quarters suddenly disappeared.  He\r\nhad gone up the tree again.\r\n\r\n\"What next?--would he turn himself in the hollow, and come down\r\nhead-foremost?  If so, my rifle was empty, and Cudjo might miss his\r\nblow, and let him pass out.\r\n\r\n\"All at once my eye fell upon the two great deerskin coats, that were\r\nlying on the ground close by.  They would be large enough, properly\r\nrolled, to fill the mouth of the cavity.  I threw aside my rifle, and\r\nlaid hold of them.  Cudjo assisted me.  In a second or two, we had\r\ngathered them into a hard `clump,' and wedged them into the hole.  They\r\nfitted it exactly!\r\n\r\n\"We saw blood streaming down as we stuffed in the coats.  The bear was\r\nwounded.  It was not likely, then, that he would trouble us for a while;\r\nand as one watched the coats, the other brought up great stones, which\r\nwe piled against them, until we had made all secure.\r\n\r\n\"We now ran around the tree, looking up the trunk, to assure ourselves\r\nthat there was no opening above, through which he might creep out and\r\ncome down upon us.  No--there was none, except the bee-hole, and that\r\nwas not big enough for his nose, sharp as it was.  Bruin was fairly `in\r\nthe trap.'\r\n\r\n\"I knew that Mary and the rest would be uneasy about us; and I ran out\r\nto the glade to make known our success.  The boys cheered loudly; and we\r\nall returned together to the tree, as there was now no danger--no more\r\nthan if there hadn't been a bear nearer to us than the North Pole.\r\n\r\n\"We had him safe, so that there was no fear of his escaping.  But how\r\nwere we to get at him?--for we had determined to take his life.  Such a\r\nfierce creature as this must not be allowed to get off; as he would soon\r\nhave settled with one of us, had he met us on anything like equal terms.\r\nI had thought, at first, he might be a grizzly bear, and this had\r\nterrified me the more--for the killing of one of these fierce animals\r\nwith a shot is next to an impossibility.  When I reflected, however, I\r\nknew it could not be this; for the `grizzly,' unlike his sable cousin,\r\nis not a tree-climber.  It was the black bear, then, that we had got in\r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\n\"But how were we to reach him?  Leave him where he was, and let him\r\nstarve to death?  No, that would never do.  He would eat all the fine\r\nstock of honey; if, indeed, he had not done so already.  Moreover, he\r\nmight scrape his way out, by enlarging the bee-hole.  This he could do\r\nwith his great sharp claws.  We must therefore adopt some other plan.\r\n\r\n\"It occurred to us that it was just probable he might be down at the\r\nbottom, poking his nose against the coats.  We could not tell, for there\r\nwas no longer any growling.  He was either too angry, or too badly\r\nscared to growl--we could not say which.  At all events, he was not\r\nuttering a sound.  He might, nevertheless, be as close to us at the\r\nmoment as he could get.  If so, our plan would be to cut a small hole in\r\nthe tree above him, so that we might reach him with a bullet from the\r\nrifle.  This plan was adopted, and Cudjo set to work to make the hole.\r\n\r\n\"In a few minutes the thin shell was penetrated, and we could see into\r\nthe cavity.  Bruin was nowhere visible--he was still up the tree.  The\r\n`taste of our quality,' which he had had on his first descent, had\r\nevidently robbed him of all inclination to try a second.  What next?\r\n\r\n\"`Smoke 'im!' cried Cudjo; `dat fotch 'im down.'\r\n\r\n\"The very thing: but how were we to do it?  By pushing dead leaves and\r\ngrass through the hole Cudjo had cut, and then setting them on fire.\r\nBut our coats--they might be burned!  These we could first remove,\r\nputting great stones in their place; and we proceeded to do so.  In a\r\nfew minutes that was accomplished: the grass and leaves were staffed in;\r\nsome tufts were set on fire and thrust through; more rubbish was piled\r\non top, until it reached up on a level with the hole; and then the hole\r\nwas closed with a bundle of grass, so as to prevent the smoke from\r\nescaping.\r\n\r\n\"In a few moments we saw that everything was progressing as we had\r\nintended it.  A blue rope of smoke came oozing out of the bee-hole, and\r\nthe terrified bees swarmed out in clusters.  We had not thought of this\r\nbefore, else we might have saved ourselves the trouble of making the\r\ngloves and masks.\r\n\r\n\"Bruin soon began to give tongue.  We could hear him high up the tree\r\nsnarling and growling fiercely.  Every now and then he uttered a loud\r\nsnort, that sounded like an asthmatic cough.  After a while his growls\r\nchanged into a whine, then a hideous moan, and then the sounds ceased\r\naltogether.  The next moment we heard a dull concussion, as of a heavy\r\nbody falling to the earth.  We knew it was the bear, as he tumbled from\r\nhis perch.\r\n\r\n\"We waited for some minutes.  There was no longer any stir--no sound\r\nissued from the tree.  We removed the grass from the upper hole.  A\r\nthick volume of smoke rolled out.  The bear must be dead.  No creature\r\ncould live in such an atmosphere.  I introduced my ramrod through the\r\nopening.  I could feel the soft hairy body of the animal, but it was\r\nlimber and motionless.  It was dead.  Feeling convinced of this, at\r\nlength, we removed the rocks below, and dragged it forth.  Yes, the bear\r\nwas dead,--or, at all events, very like it; but, to make the thing sure,\r\nCudjo gave him a knock on the head with his axe.  His long, shaggy hair\r\nwas literally filled with dead and dying bees, that, like himself, had\r\nbeen suffocated with the smoke, and had fallen from their combs.\r\n\r\n\"We had hardly settled the question of the bear, when our attention was\r\ncalled to another circumstance, which was likely to trouble us.  We\r\nperceived that the tree was on fire.  The decayed heart-wood that lined\r\nthe cavity inside had caught fire from the blazing grass, and was now\r\ncrackling away like fury.  Our honey would be lost!\r\n\r\n\"This was a grievous _finale_, after all--in short, a complete\r\ndisappointment to our hopes, for we had calculated on having honey on\r\nour table at supper.\r\n\r\n\"What could we do to save it?  But one thing, that was evident:--cut\r\ndown the tree as quickly as possible, and then cut it through again\r\nbetween the fire and the bees' nest.\r\n\r\n\"Should we have time for all this?  The fire was already high up; and\r\nthe draught, since we had opened the holes below, whizzed up the cavity\r\nas through a funnel.\r\n\r\n\"Seeing this, we closed them again; and Cudjo went to work with his axe,\r\ncutting all around the tree.  And the way he did ply that axe! he seemed\r\nto have a wager against time.  It was beautiful to see the style in\r\nwhich the chips flew!\r\n\r\n\"At length the tree began to crack, and we all stood out from it, except\r\nCudjo, who understood which way it would fall, and was not afraid of\r\nbeing crushed.  Not he! for Cudjo could `lay' a tree wherever it was\r\nwanted to the breadth of a hair.\r\n\r\n\"`Cr-r-r-ack!--cr-r-r-r-ash!' said the great sycamore, and down it came,\r\nshivering its branches into an hundred sticks as it fell.\r\n\r\n\"It had scarcely touched the ground, when we saw Cudjo attack it at\r\nanother point with his axe, as though it were some great monster, and he\r\ntrying to cut off its head.\r\n\r\n\"In a few minutes more he had laid open the cavity, close to the combs;\r\nand, to our great satisfaction, we saw that the fire had not yet reached\r\nthem.  They were well smoked, however, and completely deserted by the\r\nbees; so that we used neither our masks nor gloves in gathering the\r\nhoney.  Bruin had been before us, but he had not been long at his meal\r\nwhen we intruded upon him, as only one or two of the combs were missing.\r\nEnough was left.  It was evidently a very old hive, and there was honey\r\nenough to fill all the vessels we had brought with us.\r\n\r\n\"We bundled the bear into the cart--as his hams and skin were worth the\r\ntrouble--and leaving the old sycamore to burn out, we turned our faces\r\nhomeward.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF THE BUCKS.\r\n\r\n\"The main object we had in view was not yet accomplished.  With the\r\nexception of our flock of turkeys, none of the pets we had tamed could\r\ncontribute to our support.  We wished to capture some of the deer\r\nspecies, and for this purpose we had thought of various expedients.  We\r\nhad seen the fawns once or twice following their mothers; but we had\r\nfailed in coming up with them, although we had made several hunting\r\nexcursions for that purpose.  At length, however, instead of a fawn, we\r\nvery unexpectedly captured a couple of old bucks, of the red-deer\r\nspecies.  The circumstances of this capture were somewhat singular; and\r\nI shall detail them minutely as they occurred.\r\n\r\n\"We had gone out one day, Harry and myself, in search of the deer, and\r\nin hopes that we might be able to start, run down a fawn with the dogs,\r\nand take it alive.  For this we had muzzled both, so that they should\r\nnot tear the fawn when they came up with it--as I had often seen\r\ngreyhounds muzzled at home for the same purpose.  We went up the valley,\r\nwhere we should be most likely to fall in with the objects of our\r\nsearch; but not knowing how soon a deer might start out of the bushes,\r\nwe walked along very silently and slowly, watching the woods before us,\r\nand listening to every sound.  At length we arrived near the edge of a\r\nsmall opening, as we could tell by the clear breaks through the\r\nbranches.  It was in these glades or openings that we usually fell in\r\nwith the deer; and we advanced with increased caution, each of us\r\nholding a dog in the leash which we had made for them.  All at once a\r\nsingular noise reached our ears, evidently coming from the glade.  It\r\nsounded as if several large animals were stamping furiously over the\r\nfirm turf; but in the midst of this there was a constant cracking of\r\nsome hard substances, as if half-a-dozen men were playing with eagerness\r\nat the game of single-stick.  Every now and then we could hear a strange\r\nsound, short and fierce, like the snorting of a horse.  Of course, Harry\r\nand I stopped in our tracks the moment we first heard these singular\r\nnoises.  Our dogs cocked their ears, and wanted to spring forward; but\r\nwe held them both tightly on their strings, while we listened.  For the\r\nlife of us, neither I nor my companion could guess what was going on in\r\nthe glade.\r\n\r\n\"`What can it be, papa?' said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"`I haven't the slightest idea,' replied I.\r\n\r\n\"`It must be animals,' said he, `and a good many of them, too, to make\r\nso much stamping.  Papa, is not that the snort of a deer?  I think I\r\nhave heard deer make just such a noise.'\r\n\r\n\"`Maybe it is.  Perhaps it may be elk; but what can cause such a\r\ncommotion among them, I wonder?'\r\n\r\n\"`What think you,' suggested Harry, `if they are fighting with some\r\nanimal--a panther, or perhaps a bear?'\r\n\r\n\"`If so,' said I, `our best plan would be to get back the road we came,\r\nand that as speedily as possible.  But I do not think it is that.  They\r\nwould not stand to fight such creatures.  Both elk and deer trust to\r\ntheir heels rather than horns to escape from bears and panthers.  No, it\r\nis not that; but let us creep forward, and see what it is, anyhow.  Hold\r\nfast to your dog.  Come!'\r\n\r\n\"We crouched forward with the utmost caution, taking care not to tread\r\nupon the dry leaves and dead branches that lay across our track.  We saw\r\nbefore us a thicket of pawpaws; and we made towards this--knowing that\r\nthe broad green leaves of these bushes would screen us.  We were soon\r\namong them; and a few paces farther through the thicket brought us in\r\nfull view of the glade.  There we saw what had caused all the strange\r\nnoises, and which still continued as loud as ever.\r\n\r\n\"In the middle of the glade there were six red-deer.  They were all\r\nbucks, as we could easily tell from their great branching antlers.  They\r\nwere engaged in fierce and terrible conflict--sometimes two and two, and\r\nsometimes three or four of them, clumped together in a sort of general\r\n_melee_.  Then they would separate again; and going some distance apart,\r\nwould wheel suddenly about, and rush at each other with furious snorts--\r\nfirst striking forward with their forefeet held close together, and then\r\ngoring one another with their sharp horns, until we could see the skin\r\ntorn open, and the hair flying from them in tufts.  Their eyes were\r\nflashing like fire, and their whole actions betokened that the animals\r\nwere filled with rage and fury.\r\n\r\n\"I saw at once what all this meant.  It was now the rutting season; and\r\nthese chivalrous bucks were engaged in desperate combat about some fair\r\ndoe, as is their yearly habit.\r\n\r\n\"They were too distant for either Harry's rifle or mine; and thinking\r\nthey might fight themselves a little nearer, we determined to remain\r\nwhere we were, and watch.  The combat continued to rage furiously.\r\nSometimes a pair of them came together with such violence that both went\r\nrolling over to the earth; but in a moment they would up, and at it\r\nagain, as fiercely as ever.\r\n\r\n\"Our attention was particularly directed to two of the combatants, that\r\nwere larger and older than any of the others--as we could tell from the\r\ngreater number of points upon their antlers.  None of the others seemed\r\na match for either of these two, who had at length singled each other\r\nout as worthy antagonists, and fought separately.  After goring and\r\nstamping a while, they parted--as if by mutual consent--and walked\r\nbackward until they had got at least twenty yards from each other.  Then\r\nsetting their necks, and putting all their energy into the rush, they\r\ndashed forward, and met head to head, like a couple of rams.  There was\r\na terrible crashing among their antlers; and Harry and I looked to see\r\nwhether a pair of them had not been knocked off in the concussion; but\r\nit appeared not.  After this, the two struggled for a while, and then\r\nsuddenly paused--still head to head--as though by a tacit agreement, in\r\norder to take breath.  For some moments they stood quietly in this\r\nattitude, and then once more commenced struggling.  After a while they\r\nstopped again, still keeping their heads together, so that their red\r\nexpanded nostrils steamed into each other.  We thought that they fought\r\nquite differently from all the rest; but our eyes were now drawn to the\r\nothers, who were getting nearer us; and we prepared our rifles to\r\nreceive them.  At length several came within range; and, each of us\r\nchoosing one, we fired almost simultaneously.  At the double crack one\r\nof the bucks fell; and the other three, on perceiving the common enemy,\r\nimmediately desisted from their mutual warfare, and bounded off like\r\nlightning.  Harry and I rushed forward, as we had fired; and thinking\r\nthat the deer which we had missed--it was Harry's miss that time--might\r\nbe wounded, we unmuzzled the dogs, and let them after.  Of course, we\r\nhad stooped down to perform this operation.  What was our surprise, on\r\nlooking up again, to see the two old bucks still in the glade, and\r\nfighting, head to head, as briskly as ever!\r\n\r\n\"Our first thought was to reload our pieces, but the dogs had been let\r\nloose; and these, instead of pursuing the other deer, dashed forward at\r\nthe bucks, and the next moment sprang upon their flanks.  Harry and I\r\nrushed after, and you may guess that our surprise was still further\r\nincreased when we saw the bucks, instead of separating, still struggle\r\nhead to head--as if their desperate hostility for each other had\r\nrendered them reckless of every other danger!  When we got forward to\r\nthe spot, the mastiffs had brought both of them to their knees; and now\r\nfor the first time we perceived the true cause why they had continued\r\ntheir singular combat--because they could not help themselves--their\r\n_antlers were locked in each other_!  Yes,--held as firmly as if they\r\nhad been lashed together by thongs cut out of their own hides.  Indeed,\r\nfar more firmly, for after we had beaten off the dogs, and secured the\r\nanimals from the chance of escaping, we found their horns so\r\ninterlocked--one pair within the other--that we could not separate them\r\nwith all our efforts.  We had sadly wronged the poor old bucks, in\r\nbelieving them so desperately pugnacious.  Their hostile feelings for\r\neach other had long since ceased--no doubt the moment they found\r\nthemselves in such a terrible fix--and they now stood, nose to nose,\r\nquite frightened-like, and `down in the mouth,' as if vexed at the mess\r\nthey had got themselves into by their bad behaviour.\r\n\r\n\"Harry and I, after much pulling and hammering, found it quite\r\nimpossible to make two of them.  The antlers, which, as you know, are\r\nelastic, had bent with the terrible concussion we had witnessed; and it\r\nwas far beyond our strength to bend them back again.  In fact, nothing\r\nbut a machine of horsepower could have accomplished that.  I sent my\r\ncompanion, therefore, after Cudjo and his handsaw--at the same time\r\ndirecting him to bring the horse and cart, for the carcass of the buck\r\nwe had shot, as well as some ropes for our captives.  While he was gone,\r\nI employed my time in skinning the dead animal, leaving his live\r\ncompanions to themselves: I had no fear of their being able to escape.\r\nCowed and sullen as both of them looked, it was well for them--since we\r\ndid not mean to butcher them--that we had arrived upon the ground as we\r\ndid.  Otherwise their fate was a settled one.  The wolves, or some other\r\nof their numerous enemies, would have treated them worse than we\r\nintended to do; or even had they not been discovered by these, their\r\ndoom was sealed all the same.  They might have twisted and wriggled\r\nabout for a few days longer, to die of thirst and hunger, still looked\r\nin that hostile embrace.  Such is the fate of many of these animals.\r\n\r\n\"Cudjo soon arrived with the necessary implements; and, after hobbling\r\nboth the bucks, we sawed one of the branches from their antlers, and set\r\nthem asunder.  We then put all three into the cart, and returned\r\ntriumphant to the house.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE PIT-TRAP.\r\n\r\n\"Cudjo had already completed our deer-park, which consisted of several\r\nacres, partly woodland and part of it being in the glade immediately\r\nadjoining the house.  It was enclosed on all sides by a ten-rail fence,\r\nwith stakes and riders, so that no animal of the deer species could\r\npossibly leap out of it.  One of its sides lay along the lake; and a\r\ntrench had been cut, so as to admit a small pond of water within the\r\nenclosure.  Into this our bucks were put, and left to enjoy themselves\r\nas they best might.\r\n\r\n\"The next anxiety of Harry and myself was to procure a doe or two to\r\nkeep them company.  There was no likelihood that we should capture a\r\npair of does as we had just done the bucks--since the does or this\r\nspecies of deer are without the great antlers.  How then should we get\r\nhold of one?  That was what puzzled us, and set all our wits to work.\r\n\r\n\"As we sat around the log-fire in the evenings we talked the matter over\r\nand over again.  We might shoot one that had the fawns following at her\r\nheels; and we knew we could then easily take them--as these affectionate\r\nlittle creatures always remain by their mother, even after she has\r\nfallen by the bullet of the hunter's rifle.  But this was a cruel\r\nexpedient; and mamma, who of course overheard us planning the thing, at\r\nonce entered her protest against it.  So, too, did Frank, for he was of\r\na very gentle nature; and, as you might say, could not endure to see a\r\nfly killed, except when strict necessity required it.  Yet, withal, this\r\nsame Frank, and mamma, who were entomologists, as well as ornithologists\r\nand botanists, had killed many a fly--as might be seen by looking at a\r\nlarge frame hung against the wall, where all sorts of flies, and moths,\r\nand great bright butterflies, were impaled upon the sharp thorns of the\r\nlocust.  I am afraid that neither mamma nor Frank could have defended\r\nthe point very gracefully with so contradictory an argument hanging\r\nagainst the wall.  Harry and I, however, did not contemplate the\r\nadoption of this plan--as we knew that the fawns would be a long time in\r\ngrowing up, and we wanted an old doe or two at once.\r\n\r\n\"`Can we not trap them?' asked Harry.  `Why not take them in a trap, as\r\nFrank did the turkeys?'\r\n\r\n\"`I am afraid you would not easily get deer into such a trap as that\r\nwhere the turkeys were caught.'\r\n\r\n\"`But, papa,' continued Harry, `I have read of other kinds of traps.\r\nOne I remember well.  It is made by building a large enclosure just like\r\nour park, only leaving a gap; and then having two fences that run out\r\nfrom this gap far into the woods, and opening like the legs of a pair of\r\ncompasses.  The deer are driven between these two fences, and into the\r\ngap, when the hunters follow and close them in.  I think that looks very\r\neasy to be done.  How if we try it?'\r\n\r\n\"`It would not do at all.  In the first place, it would take us several\r\nweeks to split rails enough to make the fences sufficiently long; and,\r\nsecondly, we should require men, and dogs, and horses more than we have,\r\nto run the deer in the right direction.  All this we might manage, it is\r\ntrue, by undergoing a great deal of trouble; but I think I know a sort\r\nof trap that will serve our purpose better.'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh, you do.  I am glad.  What kind, papa?'\r\n\r\n\"`You remember where we noticed so many deer tracks running between two\r\nlarge trees?'\r\n\r\n\"`Yes, yes, near the salt spring.  You said it was a path used by the\r\ndeer and other animals, when they went to lick the salt from the rocks\r\nbelow.'\r\n\r\n\"`Well--between those two trees let us dig a pit, and cover it over with\r\nbranches, and grass, and leaves.  Then we shall see.  What think you?'\r\n\r\n\"`Oh, a pit-trap! that's the very thing!'\r\n\r\n\"Next morning, with our spade and axe, Cudjo, Pompo, and the cart, we\r\nset forth.  We were soon upon the ground, and commenced operations.  We\r\nfirst marked out the size of the pit--which was to be eight feet long,\r\nand to extend in width from tree to tree, as near to both as we could\r\nconveniently get for the great roots.  Cudjo then set to work with his\r\nspade, while I handled the axe and cut off the spreading roots as they\r\nwere laid bare.  Harry, meanwhile, employed himself with the hatchet in\r\ngetting long slender saplings and canes to cover in the pit.  We threw\r\nthe earth into the cart, and hauled it off some distance into the\r\nwoods--taking care not to spill much of it around the place.\r\nFortunately the ground was very soft and easily dug up, so that in about\r\nfive hours' time we had excavated a square hole, at least seven feet\r\ndeep.  This would do, thought we.  No deer could leap out of that hole,\r\nwe were certain.\r\n\r\n\"We now placed the saplings across the top, and over these a thin\r\nstratum of cane-reeds, and above all this a quantity of long grass and\r\nwithered leaves--so as to make it look as like as possible to the rest\r\nof the surface around it.  We then removed the clods, and other marks of\r\nour work, put our implements into the cart, and started off home again.\r\nOf course we could do nothing more than wait, until some unlucky deer\r\nshould drop into the pit.\r\n\r\n\"By sunrise on the following morning, we paid a visit to our trap.  As\r\nwe drew near, we saw to our great joy that the top was broken in.\r\n\r\n\"`We have caught something, papa,' said Harry as we ran eagerly up to\r\nthe ground.  What was our astonishment, on looking into the pit, to see\r\nlying along the bottom the naked skeleton of an animal, which we knew at\r\nonce was that of a deer!  We knew this by the horns, as well as pieces\r\nof the torn skin that were strewed all over the ground.  All around the\r\ninside of the trap there were evidences of some terrible struggle that\r\nhad taken place during the night; and the reeds and grass that had\r\nfallen in along with the animal were sprinkled with blood, and trampled\r\ndown upon the bottom of the pit.\r\n\r\n\"`What can it be?' inquired Harry, as we stood gazing at this unexpected\r\npicture.  `Ha! papa, I'll wager it was the wolves!'\r\n\r\n\"`No doubt,' replied I; `it must have been they.  The buck has fallen in\r\nduring the night; and they have just leaped down upon, and made a meal\r\nof him.'\r\n\r\n\"`Isn't it too bad,' said Harry, in a tone of vexation, `that we should\r\nhave constructed so fine a trap just to accommodate those rascally\r\nwolves?  Isn't it too bad?'\r\n\r\n\"`Have a little patience,' said I, `we shall see what can be done to\r\npunish the ravenous brutes.  Run back to the house, and bring Cudjo,\r\nwith his cart and tools--be sure you tell him to bring the large\r\nbasket.'\r\n\r\n\"In a short time Cudjo came with his spade and cart, and we get freshly\r\nto work upon the pit.  It was now so deep that we had to use the large\r\nwillow-basket which Cudjo had made some time before.  This we slung upon\r\na thong of deer's hide; and lowering it into the pit, we filled it with\r\nthe earth, drew it up again, and emptied it into the cart.  It was\r\nsomewhat laborious work; and Cudjo and I took turns about with the\r\nbasket and spade.  After a couple of hours or so, we had added four feet\r\nto the depth of our pit, which made it twelve in all.  Of course we cut\r\nthe sides as nearly perpendicular as we could--if anything a little\r\nhanging over.  We covered it as before, putting fresh leaves and grass\r\non the top of all.\r\n\r\n\"`Now,' said we to one another, as we marched off, `let us see the wolf\r\nthat will leap out of that, should he be only fool enough to drop into\r\nit.  He may kill the deer while he is in, but we shall do the same for\r\nhim in the morning.'\r\n\r\n\"Next morning we started forth again, big with expectation.  Our whole\r\nparty went,--Frank, Mary, and the little ones,--as they were all eager\r\nto see the trap, and whether we had taken anything.  Cudjo brought with\r\nhim his long spear, while Harry and I carried our rifles.  Frank armed\r\nhimself with his bow.  We were prepared for the wolves every way.\r\n\r\n\"As we drew near the trap, Harry, who had gone a few paces in advance of\r\nthe rest, came running back to announce that the top was broken in, and\r\nthat there was some animal inside.  This was great news; and we all\r\nhurried forward, filled with the excitement of expectation.  We were\r\nsoon upon the spot, and looking down into the pit.  The hole that had\r\nbeen made through the grass covering was not a very large one, and it\r\nappeared quite dark inside; but in the midst of the darkness we could\r\ndistinguish the shining eyes of animals.  There were more than one\r\npair--there were several--all looking up at us and glittering like coals\r\nof fire!  `What sort could they be?' asked we of one another.  `Were\r\nthey wolves?  Yes, they must be wolves.'\r\n\r\n\"Putting the rest to one side, I knelt down, and stretching my neck over\r\nthe hole, looked steadily in.  I was not long in this position until I\r\ncounted no less than six pairs of eyes; and, to my great surprise, these\r\neyes were of various shapes and colours.  The trap appeared to be full\r\nof animals of all sorts!\r\n\r\n\"At this moment the thought entered my head that there might be a\r\npanther among the rest; and as I knew that he could easily spring out, I\r\nbecame somewhat alarmed, and hastily rose to my feet.  I directed Mary\r\nto get into the cart along with the children; and we then led them off\r\nto some distance out of the way, until we should assure ourselves as to\r\nwhat sort of creatures were our captives.  We returned to the trap, and\r\ncautiously removing a quantity of the grass so as to admit the light, we\r\nagain looked down.  To our great delight the first animal we could\r\ndistinguish was the very one for which we had made the pit--a red doe--\r\nand still better, among her legs we saw two beautiful spotted creatures\r\nof a light cinnamon colour, which we at once recognised as fawns.  We\r\nthen looked around the pit for the others whose eyes I had seen; and\r\nthere, crouching in the darkest corners, we saw three bodies of a\r\nreddish-brown colour, closely squatted like so many foxes.  But they\r\nwere not foxes--they were wolves, as we knew well--three wolves of the\r\nbarking or prairie species.  They were not likely to bark much more,\r\nalthough they howled a bit, as Cudjo reached them with his long spear,\r\nand finished them in a trice.\r\n\r\n\"Mary was now brought back; and Cudjo, descending into the pit, secured\r\nthe doe and fawns which were soon hoisted up, and put into the cart.\r\nThe wolves were also flung out and dragged off to some distance; and the\r\ntrap was again put in order for farther captures after which we all\r\nreturned to our house, pleased with the valuable addition we had made to\r\nour stock.  We were not much less pleased at having destroyed the three\r\nwolves--for these animals were very plenty in the valley, and ever since\r\nour arrival had caused us much annoyance.  A piece of meat could not be\r\nleft outside without being carried off by them; and even since the\r\ncapture of our two bucks, they had several times chased them through the\r\npark, until the noise made by the snorting of the latter had brought our\r\ndogs, and some of us along with them, to their rescue.\r\n\r\n\"But the most curious circumstance connected with this affair was, why\r\nthese wolves had left the doe and her fawns unmolested.  They could have\r\nkilled the three in a moment's time, yet not a hair was ruffled upon any\r\nof them!  This strange conduct on the part of the wolves puzzled us all\r\nat the time; and we could not offer even a probable conjecture as to its\r\ncause.  We found it out afterwards, however, when we became better\r\nacquainted with the nature of these animals.  We found that of the wild\r\ncreatures that inhabited our valley, the prairie wolf was by far the\r\nmost sagacious of all.  Even sly Reynard himself, who has been so long\r\nfamous for his craft and cunning, is but a stupid when compared to his\r\nown cousin, the barking wolf.  This we proved satisfactorily, when we\r\nendeavoured afterwards to trap these animals.  We first tried them with\r\na `cage-trap,' similar to that which Frank had used in taking his\r\nturkeys.  We baited it inside with a nice piece of venison; but although\r\nwe saw tracks all around, and particularly on that side nearest to the\r\nbait, not one of the wolves had cared to venture up the funnel-shaped\r\nentrance.  We next laid a bait with snares around it, made out of the\r\nsinews of the deer.  We found the bait gone, and the snares gnawed to\r\npieces, as though the rats had done it; but we knew by the tracks that\r\nit was no other animals than the prairie wolves.  Our next attempt was\r\nwith a `figure-of-four' trap.  It was constructed with a large shallow\r\ncrate, made of split rails, and set leaning diagonally with its mouth\r\ndownwards.  It was held in that position with a regular staying and\r\ntriggers--just as Frank and Harry used to set their traps to catch small\r\nbirds.  The bait was placed underneath upon the staying, in the most\r\ntempting manner we could think of.  On returning to examine our trap in\r\nthe morning, we saw as we came near that it was down.  We have caught\r\none of them at last, thought we.  What was our astonishment to find, on\r\nthe contrary, that there was no wolf under the trap, and, moreover, that\r\nthe bait was gone!  This was easily explained.  A large hole had been\r\nscraped under the trap, which, running for some distance underground,\r\ncame out upon the outside.  But the most singular part of the business\r\nwas, that this hole had evidently been burrowed before the trigger had\r\nbeen touched, or the trap had fallen!  We could tell this, because the\r\nhole was made from the outside, and through it the animal had most\r\nlikely entered.  Of course, in laying hold of the bait, the trigger was\r\nsprung, and the trap fell; but it was of no use then, as the wolf had\r\nonly to crawl out through the subterranean road he had made, dragging\r\nthe meat along with him!\r\n\r\n\"We again tried the `pit-trap'--although we still had the one which we\r\nhad made near the salt springs, and in which we afterwards from time to\r\ntime caught deer and other animals, but no wolves.  We made another,\r\nhowever, at a different part of the valley, near some caves where we\r\nknew the wolves were in great plenty.  We baited this, first placing\r\nsome venison upon the covering of leaves, and afterwards putting one of\r\nour live bucks into the pit; but in both cases the bait remained\r\nuntouched, although we had sufficient evidence that wolves had been\r\naround it all the night.\r\n\r\n\"We were very much chagrined by these numerous disappointments, as we\r\nwanted to thin off the wolves as much as possible.  We occasionally shot\r\nan odd one or two; but we as often missed them; and we could not afford\r\nto waste our powder and lead upon them.  Cudjo, however, did the\r\nbusiness at last, by constructing a trap such as he said he had often\r\ncaught raccoons with in `old Vaginny.'  This was arranged something on\r\nthe principle of the wire mouse-trap; and the spring consisted in a\r\nyoung tree or sapling bent down and held in a state of tension until the\r\ntrigger was touched, when it instantly flew up, and a heavy log\r\ndescended upon whatever animal was at the bait, crushing or killing it\r\ninstantly.  By means of Cudjo's invention we succeeded in taking nearly\r\na dozen of our skulking enemies in the course of a few nights, after\r\nwhich time they grew so shy, that they would not approach anything at\r\nall that looked like a `fixture,' and for a long while we could trap no\r\nmore of them.\r\n\r\n\"Of course all these incidents occurred afterwards, but they convinced\r\nus that it was owing to their great sagacity, why the three we had\r\nkilled in the pit had left undisturbed the doe and her fawns.  They were\r\nno doubt the same that had eaten the buck on the night before.  They had\r\nfound him in a shallow pit, out of which, after making their supper upon\r\nhim, they had easily escaped.  Returning again next night, they had\r\nwatched until the doe and her fawns came along and dropped into the pit;\r\nand then, without dreaming of any change in the circumstances of the\r\ncase, the wolves had leaped in after.  But the increased descent down\r\nwhich they had pitched, convinced these wary animals that they had\r\n`leaped without looking,' and were `in the trap' themselves; and,\r\nguessing that whoever had made that trap would soon be alongside, they\r\nwere as much frightened as the poor doe.  In this state we had actually\r\nfound them--cowering and crouching, and more scared-like than the fawns\r\nthemselves.  You will think this a very improbable relation, yet it is\r\nquite true.  An equally improbable event occurred not long after.  Frank\r\ncaught a large fox and a turkey in his trap; and although they had been\r\ntogether for some hours, not a feather of the turkey was plucked by its\r\naffrighted neighbour!\r\n\r\n\"I have also heard of a panther, who, by the sudden rising of a flood,\r\nhad found himself upon a small islet in company with a deer; and\r\nalthough at any other time his first instinct would have led him to\r\npounce upon the deer, yet the poor thing was allowed to run about\r\nwithout its fierce companion making any attempt to molest it.  The\r\npanther saw that he and the deer were equally in peril; and a common\r\ndanger among the wild animals--as among men--frequently changes foes\r\ninto friends.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE OLD \"'POSSUM\" AND HER KITTENS.\r\n\r\n\"The next adventure which befell us was near having a more serious\r\ntermination.  This time Frank was my companion, while Harry remained at\r\nhome with his mother.  Our errand was to procure some of the long\r\nSpanish moss that grew upon the live-oaks in the lower end of the\r\nvalley.  This moss, when smoked and cleansed of the leaves and pieces of\r\nbark that adhere to it, makes most excellent stuffing for\r\nbed-mattresses--in fact, almost equal to curled hair--and for this\r\npurpose we wanted it.  We did not take the cart, as Cudjo had Pompo in\r\nthe plough, preparing a large tract for our second crop of corn.  We\r\nonly carried with us a couple of raw-hide ropes, intending to bring home\r\ngood burdens of the moss upon our rock.\r\n\r\n\"We travelled on down the valley, looking for a tree with moss upon it,\r\nthat we could climb.  At length, almost close to the foot of the cliff,\r\nwe chanced upon a very large live-oak, with low branches, from which the\r\nlong, silvery moss was hanging down in streamers, like the tails of\r\nhorses.  We soon stripped off what was on the lower branches; and then,\r\nclimbing up on these, proceeded to rob the others, that were higher, of\r\ntheir long stringy parasites.\r\n\r\n\"While thus engaged, our attention was attracted to the chirping and\r\nchattering of some birds in a thicket of pawpaws close to our tree.  We\r\nlooked in that direction, and we could see down into the thicket very\r\nplainly from where we stood among the branches.  We saw that the birds\r\nmaking the noise were a pair of orioles, or `Baltimore birds,' as they\r\nare often called, from the fact that, in the early settlements, their\r\ncolour--a mixture of black and orange--was observed to be the same as\r\nthat in the coat-of-arms of Lord Baltimore.  Frank and I conjectured\r\nthat they must have a nest among the pawpaws, for they had scolded us as\r\nwe were passing through but a moment before.  But what were they\r\nscolding at now? asked we of one another--for the birds were fluttering\r\namong the broad green leaves, uttering their shrill screams, and\r\nevidently under great excitement.  We left off gathering our moss, and\r\nstood for a moment to see what it was all about.\r\n\r\n\"Presently we noticed a strange-looking object in motion along the\r\nground, and close in to the edge of the thicket.  At first sight we knew\r\nnot what to make of it.  Was it an animal?  No--it could not be that.\r\nIt had not the shape of any animal we had ever seen: and yet we could\r\nsee legs and tails, and ears and eyes, and heads--heads, indeed!--there\r\nseemed to be a head sticking out of every part of its body, for we\r\ncounted half a score of them as it moved along.  It moved very slowly,\r\nand when nearly opposite to us it stopped, so that we had a good view of\r\nit.  All at once the numerous heads seemed to separate from the main\r\nbody, becoming little bodies of themselves with long tails upon them,\r\nand looking just like a squad of white rats!  The large body to which\r\nthey had all been attached we now saw was an old female opossum, and\r\nevidently the mother of the whole troop.  She was about the size of a\r\ncat, and covered with woolly hair of a light grey colour.  She had a\r\nsnout somewhat resembling that of a pig, though much sharper at the\r\npoint, and with whiskers like a cat.  Her ears were short and standing--\r\nher mouth very wide, and, as we could see, full of sharp teeth.  The\r\nlegs were short and stout, and the feet with their keen claws seemed to\r\nspread out upon the ground more like hands than feet.  The tail was very\r\npeculiar; it was nearly as long as the body, tapering like that of a\r\nrat, and quite naked.  But the greatest curiosity in the structure of\r\nthis creature was a pouch like opening which appeared under her belly,\r\nand which showed that she belonged to the family of the _marsupialia_,\r\nor pouched animals.  This, of course, we had known before.  The little\r\n`'possums' were exact pictures of their mother--all having the same\r\nsharp snouts and long naked tails.  We counted no less than thirteen of\r\nthem, playing and tumbling about among the leaves.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the old one had shaken them all off, she stepped more nimbly\r\nover the ground--going backwards and forwards, and looking up into one\r\nof the pawpaws that grew above the spot where she had halted.  In this\r\ntree the orioles were now fluttering about, chirruping wildly, and at\r\nintervals making a dash downward, until their wings almost swept the\r\nnose of the opossum.  The latter, however, appeared to take all this\r\nvery coolly; and evidently did not care for the imbecile efforts of the\r\nbirds to frighten her off, but continued her survey without paying any\r\nattention to their manoeuvres.  On looking upward, we discovered the\r\nobject of her search--the nest of the orioles--which was hanging like a\r\nlarge purse, or rather like a distended stocking, from the topmost twigs\r\nof the tree.\r\n\r\n\"After a few moments the old 'possum seemed to have made up her mind;\r\nand, approaching the spot where the young ones were scrambling about,\r\nshe uttered a short sharp note that brought them all around her.\r\nSeveral of them ran into the pouch which she had caused to open for\r\nthem.  Two of them took a turn of their little tails around the root of\r\nhers, and climbed up on her rump, almost burying themselves in the long\r\nwool; while two or three others fastened themselves about her neck and\r\nshoulders.  It was a most singular sight to see the little creatures\r\nholding on with `tails, teeth, and toe-nails,' while some peeped\r\ncomically out of the great breast-pocket.\r\n\r\n\"We thought she was going to move away with her cargo; but, to our\r\nastonishment, she walked up to the pawpaw, and commenced climbing it.\r\nWhen she had reached the lowermost branch--which grew nearly\r\nhorizontal--she halted; then, taking the young ones, one by one, in her\r\nmouth, she caused each of them to make a turn or two of its tail around\r\nthe branch, and hang head downwards.  Five or six of the `kittens' were\r\nstill upon the ground.  For these she returned, and taking them up as\r\nbefore, again climbed the tree.  She disposed of the second load,\r\nprecisely as she had done the others--until the thirteen little 'possums\r\nhung head downwards along the branch, like a string of candles!\r\n\r\n\"It was such a comical sight to see these monkey-looking little\r\ncreatures dangling by their tails, that my companion and I could not\r\nrestrain our laughter as we gazed upon it.  We took care, however, not\r\nto laugh aloud--as we were anxious to observe the further movements of\r\nthe old 'possum, and we knew that if she should hear us it would spoil\r\nthe sport at once.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as she saw the young ones all fairly suspended, she left them,\r\nand commenced climbing higher up the tree.  We noticed that she caught\r\nthe branches in her claws, exactly as a human being would have done with\r\nhis hands, hoisting herself from limb to limb.  At length she reached\r\nthat branch upon which hung the nest, far out at its top.  For a moment\r\nshe stopped and surveyed it.  She was evidently in doubt whether it\r\nwould carry her weight without breaking, and so were we.  Should it\r\nbreak, she would have a smart fall to the ground--for the tree was one\r\nof the highest, for a pawpaw, we had ever seen; and there were no other\r\nbranches below to which she could clutch in case of falling.\r\n\r\n\"The nest, however, full of eggs no doubt, tempted her on; and, after a\r\nmoment's pause, she started along the branch.  When about half-way up\r\nit--holding on both with tail and feet--the slender sapling began to\r\ncreak and bend, and show symptoms of breaking.  This, with the screaming\r\nof the birds--that now flapped against her very nose--seemed all at once\r\nto cow her; and she crept down again, going backwards along the limb.\r\nOn reaching the fork, she paused, and looked about with an air that\r\nshowed she was both vexed and puzzled.  All at once her eyes rested upon\r\nthe branch of an oak-tree, that stretched out over the pawpaw, and\r\ndirectly above the orioles' nest.  She looked at this for a moment--as\r\nif calculating its height from the nest; then seeming to make up her\r\nmind, she ran nimbly down the pawpaw, over the ground that intervened,\r\nand up the trunk of the oak.  We lost sight of her for an instant among\r\nthe thick leaves; but the next we saw her crawling out upon the branch\r\nthat overhung the pawpaw.\r\n\r\n\"When she had reached a point directly above the nest, she flung herself\r\nfearlessly from the branch, and hung to her whole length--suspended by\r\nthe tail.  In this position she oscillated back and forward, with gaping\r\nmouth and outstretched claws, endeavouring to seize hold of the nest;\r\nbut, with all her efforts, and no doubt to her great mortification, she\r\nwas unable to reach it.  She hung for several minutes, clutching, now at\r\nthe nest, now at the leaves of the pawpaw, and evidently tantalised by\r\nthe thought of the delicious eggs so near her very nose.  We could see\r\nthat she had lowered herself to the last link of her tail--until only a\r\nsingle turn of it sustained her upon the limb--and we expected every\r\nmoment to see her fall to the ground.  Her stretching was all to no\r\npurpose, however; and at length, uttering a bitter snarl, she swung\r\nherself back to the limb, and came running down from the oak.\r\n\r\n\"She seemed to have given up her purpose in a sort of angry despair; for\r\nclimbing up the pawpaw, she hurried her young from the branch, pitching\r\nthem somewhat rudely to the ground.  In a short while she had gathered\r\nthem all upon her back and into her pouch; and commenced retreating from\r\nthe spot--while the orioles changed their terrified screaming into\r\nchirrups of victory.\r\n\r\n\"Frank and I now deemed it proper to interfere, and cut off the retreat\r\nof the `old 'possum;' so, dropping from our perch, we soon overtook and\r\ncaptured the whole family.  The old one, on first seeing us approach,\r\nrolled herself into a round clump--so that neither her head nor legs\r\ncould be seen--and in this attitude feigned to be quite dead.  Several\r\nof the youngsters, who were _outside_, immediately detached themselves,\r\nand imitated the example of their mother--so that the family now\r\npresented the appearance of a large ball of whitish wool, with several\r\nsmaller `clews' lying around it!\r\n\r\n\"On finding, however, that we were not to be cheated, and being pricked\r\ngently with the point of an arrow, the old one unwound herself; and,\r\nopening her long jaws, snapped and bit on every side of her, uttering\r\nall the while a sharp noise, like the snarling of a poodle.\r\n\r\n\"Her snarling did not avail her, for in a few minutes we had muzzled her\r\nsecurely, and made her fast to one of the saplings--intending to take\r\nthe whole family with us when we returned to the house.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY NINE.\r\n\r\nTHE MOCCASON SNAKE AND THE ORIOLES.\r\n\r\n\"We now climbed back into the live-oak, and recommenced flinging down\r\nour moss.  We were chatting gaily about the curious scene we had just\r\nwitnessed.  Frank was remarking how lucky he had been in thus finding\r\nthe nest of the orioles--as he wanted young birds of that species, and\r\nhe could return for them whenever they were hatched.  All of a sudden,\r\nthese birds--that since the defeat of the 'possum had remained perfectly\r\nquiet--again commenced screaming and chattering as before.\r\n\r\n\"`Another 'possum!' said Frank; `maybe it's the old father coming to\r\nlook after his family.'\r\n\r\n\"We both stopped, and looked down.  We soon discovered what was causing\r\nthis new commotion.  Slowly gliding over the grass, and glittering as it\r\nwent, was a long monster-looking object.  It was a huge serpent--a snake\r\nof the most venomous kind--the dreaded `moccason.'  It was one of the\r\nlargest of its species; and its great flat head, protruding sockets, and\r\nsparkling eyes, added to the hideousness of its appearance.  Every now\r\nand then, as it advanced, it threw out its forked tongue, which, moist\r\nwith poisonous saliva, flashed under the sunbeam like jets of fire.  It\r\nwas crawling directly for the tree on which hung the nest.  Frank and I\r\nstood still where we were--determined to watch its movements, as we had\r\ndone those of the opossum.  On reaching the root of the pawpaw, it\r\nstopped for a moment, as if to consider.\r\n\r\n\"`Do you think it is going to climb up to the nest?' inquired my\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"`No,' I replied, `the moccason is not a tree-climber.  If it were, the\r\npoor birds as well as the squirrels would have little chance; but it\r\ncannot climb.  Look at it! it is only making pretence--to frighten the\r\norioles still more, if possible.'\r\n\r\n\"As I said this, the snake had drawn its body closer to the tree, and\r\nraised its flat head up against the trunk, throwing out its tongue as if\r\nit was licking the bark.\r\n\r\n\"The orioles, evidently believing that it was about to climb up, had now\r\ndescended to the lowest branches, fluttering from one to the other, and\r\nscreaming all the while either with rage, or terror, or both combined.\r\n\r\n\"The snake, seeing them approach almost within range of his hideous maw,\r\ngathered himself into a coil, and prepared to strike.  His eyes\r\nscintillated like sparks of fire, and seemed to fascinate the birds;\r\nfor, instead of retiring, they each moment drew nearer and nearer, now\r\nalighting on the ground, then flapping back to the branches, and anon\r\ndarting to the ground again--as though they were under some spell from\r\nthose fiery eyes, and were unable to take themselves away!  Their\r\nmotions appeared to grow less energetic--their chirping became almost\r\ninaudible--and their wings seemed hardly to expand as they flew, or\r\nrather fluttered, around the head of the serpent.  One of them at length\r\ndropped down upon the ground--within reach of the snake--and stood with\r\nopen bill, as if exhausted, and unable to move farther.  We were\r\nexpecting to see the snake suddenly launch forth upon his feathered\r\nvictim; when, all at once, his coils flew out, his body was thrown at\r\nfull length, and he commenced retreating from the tree!  The birds,\r\napparently released from the spell that had bound them, flew up to the\r\nhigher branches, and ceased their screaming!\r\n\r\n\"For a while, my companion and I stood silent, wondering at this\r\nunexpected termination of the scene.\r\n\r\n\"`What can have driven him off?' asked Frank, turning to me with a look\r\nof inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"Before I could make any reply, an object appeared upon the edge of the\r\nthicket which attracted the attention of both of us.  It was an animal\r\nabout the size of a wolf, and of a dark grey or blackish colour.  Its\r\nbody was compact, round-shaped, and covered--not with hair, but--with\r\nshaggy bristles, that along the ridge of its back were nearly six inches\r\nin length, and gave it the appearance of having a mane.  It had very\r\nshort ears, no tail whatever, or only a knob; and we could see that its\r\nfeet were hoofed, not clawed as in beasts of prey.  But, whether beast\r\nof prey or not, its long mouth, with two white tusks protruding over the\r\njaws, gave it a very formidable appearance.  Its head and nose resembled\r\nthose of the hog more than any other animal; and, in fact, it was\r\nnothing else than the _peccary_--the wild hog of Mexico.  As it came out\r\nfrom the long weeds and grass, we saw that two smaller animals, of a\r\ndark reddish colour--two young peccaries--were following at its heels.\r\nLike the opossum, it was a mother and her brood.\r\n\r\n\"The three soon drew near the pawpaws; and the orioles seeing them, once\r\nmore set up the scolding concert.  But the old peccary paid no attention\r\nto the birds.  They were nothing to her; and she passed on with her nose\r\nto the ground, occasionally stopping to pick up a seed or a nut.\r\n\r\n\"In going away from the thicket, she crossed the track by which the\r\nserpent had retreated.  All on a sudden she stopped, tossed up her nose,\r\nand scented the air.  The fetid smell of the moccason had reached her,\r\nand seemed at once to rouse all her energies.  She ran for some moments\r\nfrom side to side with her nose to the ground, and lifting the trail\r\nlike a hound.  She first followed it back to the tree, but there was a\r\ndouble trail--that by which the snake had come, as well as the one he\r\nhad just made in retreating--and this for a moment puzzled her.  She\r\ntook the wrong trail at first, and galloped nimbly out upon it; but,\r\nalmost in the same breath, returned to the tree, and then started upon\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\"During all these manoeuvres, the snake was crawling off as fast as he\r\ncould--which at best was only a very tardy gait, for the moccason is but\r\na slow traveller.  We could see that he kept as much as possible under\r\nthe grass, occasionally raising his flattened head, and glaring behind\r\nhim.  He was making for the cliffs, that were only about a stone's throw\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\n\"He had got scarce half-way, when the peccary running up the fresh trail\r\nalmost trod upon him; and, seeing the object of her pursuit, she\r\nsuddenly stopped, erected her long bristles, and uttered a shrill grunt.\r\nThe snake, finding that he was overtaken, threw himself into a coil,\r\nand prepared to give battle; while his antagonist, now looking more like\r\na great porcupine than a pig, drew back, as if to take the advantage of\r\na run; and then halted.  Both for a moment eyed each other--the peccary\r\nevidently calculating its distance,--while the great snake seemed cowed,\r\nand quivering with affright.  Its appearance was entirely different from\r\nthe bright semblance it had exhibited but a moment before, when engaged\r\nwith the birds.  Its eyes were less fiery, and its whole body seemed\r\nmore ashy and wrinkled.\r\n\r\n\"We had not many moments to observe it, for the peccary was now seen to\r\nrush forward, spring high into the air, and pounce down with all her\r\nfeet held together upon the coils of the serpent!  She immediately\r\nbounded back again; and, quick as thought, once more rose above her\r\nvictim.  The snake was now uncoiled, and writhing over the ground.\r\nAnother rush from the peccary--another spring--and the sharp hoofs of\r\nthe animal came down upon the neck of the serpent, crushing it upon the\r\nhard turf.  The body of the reptile, distended to its full length,\r\nquivered for a moment, and then lay motionless along the grass.  The\r\nvictor uttered another sharp cry--that seemed intended as a call to her\r\nyoung ones--who, emerging from the weeds, where they had concealed\r\nthemselves, ran nimbly forward to the spot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF THE COUGAR AND PECCARIES.\r\n\r\n\"Frank and I were rather pleased with the result of the encounter;\r\nthough I do not see why we should have taken sides with the peccary, who\r\nwould have eaten the birds--could she have caught them--and their eggs,\r\ntoo, just as fast as the snake would have done.  And why should we have\r\ntaken the part of the birds either, who, in their turn, had devoured\r\nmany a butterfly as bright and beautiful as themselves?  But so it is.\r\nFrom time immemorial, the poor snake--who is comparatively a harmless\r\nanimal, and whose deadly powers have been greatly exaggerated--has been\r\nhated and persecuted by man more than any other creature; thus\r\nfulfilling in a remarkable manner the prophecy of the Sacred Book.\r\n\r\n\"We began to consider what plan we should take to capture the animal.\r\nWe desired very much to get possession of the young ones, as we knew\r\nthey would be a valuable addition to our stock, and would serve us in\r\nthe place of real pigs--though their flesh does not taste much like\r\npork.  It is more like that of the hare.  In fact, it is not eatable at\r\nall, unless certain precautions are taken immediately after the animal\r\nis killed.  There is a glandular opening on the back, just above the\r\nrump, that has been improperly called a navel.  In this opening, there\r\nis a substance that emits a strong smell of musk; and if the whole part\r\nbe not cut out, in less than an hour after the animal has been killed,\r\nthe flesh becomes so impregnated with the musky odour, that it is quite\r\nunpalatable.  If the gland, however, be removed in time, peccary-pork is\r\nnot bad eating--though there is no lard in it, as in the common pork;\r\nand, as we have said, it tastes more like the flesh of the hare.\r\n\r\n\"But my companion and I did not think of these things at the time.  We\r\nonly thought of how we could capture the young peccaries.\r\n\r\n\"It was plain that, while the mother was with them, the thing would be\r\nimpossible.  We knew that we dared not encounter the fierce brute.  Even\r\nhad we had our dogs with us, she would have been more than a match for\r\nboth of them with her sharp tusks, and long crocodile-shaped jaws.  In\r\nfact, the most courageous dog will lower his tail, and run from the\r\nattack of this animal; and if, on the contrary, he should await it, it\r\nwould only be to have a leg snapped off, or his side ripped open.  It\r\nwas plain, then, as long as the old one was there to guard them, we\r\ncould never lay our fingers upon the `shoats.'  What was to be done?\r\nShould we send a rifle bullet at the mother?  Frank thought this would\r\nbe cruel, and so it would have been.  Still I knew that the peccary was\r\na fierce animal, and not much entitled to the mercy we would have shown\r\nto a deer, or any harmless creature like that.  I knew, moreover, that\r\nthere were a good many of them in the valley--for we had seen their\r\ntracks in the mud--and it was exceedingly dangerous to come in contact\r\nwith them.  Indeed, hunters and others have been often surrounded, and\r\ntorn in pieces by them.  Such, then, being the case, I felt that it\r\nwould not be wise to let any of them escape, whenever we could destroy\r\nthem--else they might at some time destroy one of ourselves.  With these\r\nthoughts in my mind, I paid but little attention to the remonstrances of\r\nFrank; but, bending down from the branch, on which we stood, I reached\r\nfor my rifle.  I could just lay hold of the muzzle, as it leaned against\r\nthe tree; and, drawing it cautiously up, I prepared to fire.\r\n\r\n\"During all this time, the peccary had been busy with the carcass of the\r\nsnake.  After killing it, she had bitten off the head; and, holding the\r\nbody between her forefeet, she had peeled off the skin with her tusks\r\nand teeth as adroitly as a fishmonger would have skinned an eel!  She\r\nhad just finished this operation as I got hold of the gun; and was now\r\ntearing up the white flesh, and throwing it in small pieces to the\r\nyoungsters--all the while uttering low grants, that betokened her\r\nsatisfaction and enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\"I raised my rifle, and was about to take aim, when an object caught my\r\neye, which caused me to lower it again with a feeling of terror.  The\r\npeccary was about fifty yards from the tree upon which we stood; and\r\nabout twenty yards beyond, another animal, of a far different character,\r\nwas seen coming out of the jungle.  It was about the size of a vealed\r\ncalf, but shorter in the legs, and much longer in the body.  It was all\r\nover of a deep red colour, except the breast and throat, which were\r\nnearly white.  Its ears were erect, short and blackish; its head and\r\nmuzzle cat-shaped; and its whole body somewhat resembled the figure of a\r\ncat--except that its back, instead of being arched, was hollow, and sunk\r\naway below the level of its gaunt muscular shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"It would have been a fearful thing to look at, even had we not known\r\nwhat it was; but we did know, and that rendered the sight of it still\r\nmore terrifying.  It was the `cougar!'\r\n\r\n\"Now, for the first time, since coming upon the spot, we felt fear.  We\r\nknew that the peccary, savage as it was, could not climb the tree; and\r\nhitherto we had deemed ourselves secure.  We were now no longer so.  We\r\nknew that the cougar could ascend a tree with the agility of a squirrel,\r\nand was as much at home among the branches as upon the ground itself.  I\r\nknew all this; and I turned to my companion, and whispered him to remain\r\nmotionless and silent.\r\n\r\n\"The cougar came on with stealthy tread.  His eyes, as we could see,\r\nwere set upon the unconscious peccary; and his legs were strained down\r\nas he moved--so that one would have fancied he was crawling upon his\r\nbelly.  His long tail, stretched away behind him, was gently waving from\r\nside to side--exactly after the manner of a cat when stealing through\r\nthe stubble upon the basking partridge.\r\n\r\n\"All this time the peccary was greedily devouring the snake, wholly\r\nunconscious of the danger that was gathering over her.  The ground, for\r\nsome distance around her, was clear of weeds and brushwood; but a large\r\ntree stood near; and its long, horizontal branches stretched out,\r\ncasting their shade upon the spot she occupied.  On reaching the margin\r\nof the weeds, that had hitherto partially concealed him, the cougar\r\nsuddenly stopped, and appeared to deliberate.  He knew that, unless he\r\ncould spring suddenly and unawares upon the back of his victim, he would\r\nhave to encounter those terrible tusks, the effects of which he saw\r\nexhibited at that moment on the carcass of the great reptile.  He was\r\nstill too distant to reach the peccary with a single spring; and he\r\nappeared to be considering how he might get a little nearer without\r\nbeing discovered.\r\n\r\n\"All at once, his eyes rested upon the over-stretching branches--a\r\nsudden change took place in his attitude; and, turning slowly and\r\nsilently, he crawled back among the weeds.  We could see that he was\r\nmaking a _detour_ to get upon the other side of the tree from that\r\noccupied by the peccary.  Presently we saw him approach the trunk, and\r\nthe next moment spring up more like a streak of red light than a living\r\nanimal.  We could hear the rattle of his claws on the loose bark, as he\r\npassed upward; and the peccary, too, seemed to have heard it, for she\r\nthrew up her head with a grunt, and stood for a moment listening.\r\n\r\n\"`Only a squirrel, perhaps!' thought she, and again resumed her\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\n\"The cougar now appeared coming from behind the trunk; and, after\r\nlooking cautiously about him, commenced crawling out along the branch.\r\nOn reaching one of its forks, he gathered himself like a cat; and then,\r\nwith a terrific scream, sprang down upon the back of his victim.  His\r\nclaws were buried in her neck at the first dash; and his long body\r\ncovered hers--his hind-legs and tail warping around her.  The frightened\r\nanimal uttered a shrill cry, and struggled to free herself.  Both rolled\r\nover on the ground--the peccary all the while gnashing her jaws, and\r\ncontinuing to send forth her strange sharp cries, until the woods echoed\r\nagain.  Even the young ones ran around, mixing in the combat--now flung\r\nsprawling upon the earth, now springing up again, snapping their little\r\njaws, and imitating the cry of their mother.  The cougar alone fought in\r\nsilence.  Since the first wild scream, not a sound had escaped him; but\r\nfrom that moment his claws never relaxed their hold; and we could see\r\nthat with his teeth he was silently tearing the throat of his victim.\r\n\r\n\"The combat did not last long--only a few moments.  The peccary soon\r\nceased to struggle, and lay upon her side--still in the embrace of her\r\nterrible adversary--who had now torn open the veins of the neck, and\r\nwas, silently and cat-like, lapping the warm blood.\r\n\r\n\"With all the hostility which we felt for the cowardly cougar, we did\r\nnot deem it prudent to interfere.  We knew that he would serve us just\r\nas he was doing the peccary, if he only knew that we were so convenient\r\nto him; and we therefore remained perfectly still, not daring to move\r\neven a limb.  He was not thirty yards from us, for the struggle had\r\nbrought both him and his victim nearer to our tree.  I could have shot\r\nhim as he lay crouching in the enjoyment of his red meal; but I knew too\r\nwell the the uncertainty of killing such a muscular and powerful animal\r\nwith a rifle bullet; and I resolved to let him finish his feast, and\r\ntake himself off if he would, without any hindrance on our part.\r\n\r\n\"We were not allowed much time to think about it; for the combat was\r\nhardly over, when strange voices reached our ears, coming from the\r\nwoods, apparently on all sides of us.  They had reached the ears of the\r\ncougar, too; for the fierce brute started suddenly to his legs, and\r\nstood listening, and, as we thought, somewhat alarmed.  He seemed to\r\nhesitate a moment, looking around him and down at the fresh-killed\r\nanimal.  Then, as if suddenly forming a resolution, he buried his teeth\r\nin the throat of the dead peccary; and, swinging the carcass over his\r\nlong back, commenced retreating.\r\n\r\n\"He had made only a few steps, when the noises that had been all this\r\ntime growing more distinct were heard upon the very edge of the\r\nunderwood; and, the next moment, several dark objects bounded out into\r\nthe opening.  We saw at a glance they were peccaries.  There were twenty\r\nor thirty in all.  They had been summoned by the cries of the one that\r\nhad been killed.  They came from every side, rushing simultaneously\r\nforward, and uttering their shrill grants as they ran.\r\n\r\n\"They had got between the cougar and trees, before he could reach the\r\nlatter; and, in fact, they were upon him on all sides, almost in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye.  They formed a complete circle around him; and with\r\ntheir long bristles erected, their gnashing jaws, and shrill notes, they\r\npresented a most formidable array.\r\n\r\n\"The cougar, seeing that his retreat was cut off--at least, so long as\r\nhe carried the carcass--flung off his burden, and leaped upon the\r\nforemost of his advancing enemies, striking it to the ground with his\r\nhuge paws.  He had not time to turn himself, however, when several\r\nothers fastened on him from behind; and we could see the red fur fly\r\nfrom his sides, torn up by their sharp tusks.  Now came the struggle in\r\nearnest.  For a short while the cougar kept his antagonists at bay--\r\nstriking them down and tearing them with teeth and claws; but at length\r\nthe whole herd closed upon him, and we could see the blood streaming\r\nfrom his torn flanks.  He now seemed to fight as if wishing to make his\r\nway through them and escape; but the peccaries, as active as himself,\r\nhemmed him in their midst, surrounding him with a dense mass of bodies\r\nand snapping jaws.  Twice or three times, the cougar sprang into the\r\nair--as if to leap beyond the circle of his antagonists--but at the same\r\ntime several of these were also seen to rear upward, and intercept him\r\nin the spring.  At length, by a desperate effort, he succeeded in\r\nclearing himself; and dashed out from among them, striving to escape.\r\nWhat was our horror, on perceiving that he ran directly for the tree\r\nupon which we were standing!\r\n\r\n\"With a feeling akin to despair, I cocked my rifle; but, before I could\r\nbring it to bear upon his body, he had passed up the tree like a flash;\r\nand lay crouching not twenty feet above our heads, and glaring down at\r\nus!  So close had he been in passing, that his claws brushed my arm, and\r\nI could feel his warm breath upon my face!  The peccaries had followed\r\nto the foot of the tree, and there stopped--being unable to climb it.\r\nSome of them ran around, gazing upward.  Others tore the bark with their\r\nteeth; and all of them uttered their shrill screams of fury and\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n\"For some moments, Frank and I stood terror struck.  We knew not what\r\nwas best to be done.  There, above, was the terrible cougar, his eyes\r\nglaring like balls of fire at ourselves, who were within reach of a\r\nsingle spring!  We knew not the moment he might leap down upon us.\r\nBelow, again, was an enemy, equally terrible, in the peccaries.  They\r\nwould have torn us to pieces in an instant, had we attempted to descend\r\nto the ground.  No wonder, then, we were terrified at the dilemma in\r\nwhich we were so suddenly placed.  No wonder it was some moments before\r\nI could gather resolution enough to act.\r\n\r\n\"At length, however, I bethought myself that of the two enemies the\r\ncougar was certainly the worse.  We were safe from the peccaries so long\r\nas we remained upon the tree, while we were at the mercy of the other,\r\ngo where we would.  I resolved, therefore, to direct my energies toward\r\nthe destruction of the latter.\r\n\r\n\"All this time, the cougar had remained where he had first perched\r\nhimself in an upper fork of the tree.  He would, no doubt, have attacked\r\nus sooner had he not dreaded the peccaries below; but he feared that by\r\nspringing at us he might precipitate himself amongst them; and this kept\r\nhim for the moment quiet.  I knew very well, however, that as soon as\r\nthe animals at the foot of the tree should take their departure, our\r\nfate would be sealed.\r\n\r\n\"My companion was unarmed.  He had brought with him only his bow and\r\narrows.  These had been left at the foot of the tree, and were already\r\ncrunched in pieces by the peccaries.  I put him behind me, therefore--so\r\nthat he should be out of the way of the cougar in case I should only\r\nsucceed in wounding the latter, and it might spring upon us.  All this\r\nwas done in silence, and as gently as possible, so as not to startle the\r\nmonster that lay above us, glaring and growling.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I was ready, I brought up my rifle slowly and with great\r\ncaution.  I steadied myself on the limb of the tree, and took aim\r\ndirectly for the head of the cougar--which was the only part of him I\r\ncould see for the moss.  I pulled trigger.  The smoke for a while\r\nblinded me, and I could not tell the effects of my shot; but I heard a\r\nrustling noise--as of some heavy body falling through the leaves and\r\nbranches--then a dull sound as of the same body striking against the\r\nearth--and the next instant louder screams, and a sudden rushing among\r\nthe peccaries.  I looked below.  I saw the red body of the cougar\r\nstruggling in their midst; but it did not struggle long, for in a few\r\nmoments it was tossed upon their snouts, and mangled by their long\r\nfierce tusks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY ONE.\r\n\r\nBESIEGED IN A TREE.\r\n\r\n\"I now believed that we were safe.  Both Frank and I experienced that\r\nhappiness which men feel who have been suddenly snatched from the jaws\r\nof death.  `The peccaries,' thought we, `will soon disperse and go off\r\ninto the woods, now that their enemy has been destroyed.'  To our\r\nconsternation, however, we soon found that we were mistaken; for,\r\ninstead of retiring after they had glutted their vengeance upon the\r\ncougar, they again surrounded the tree, looking fiercely up at us,\r\ntearing the bark as before, and uttering their wild cries.  It was\r\nevident they were determined to destroy us if they could.  It was a\r\nstrange way to thank us for delivering over to them their enemy!\r\n\r\n\"We were upon the lower branches, and they could see us distinctly.  We\r\nmight easily have climbed higher, but that would have served no purpose,\r\nas they could not reach us where we were.  They could only destroy us by\r\nkeeping us in the tree, until we might perish by hunger or thirst; and\r\nfrom what I had heard of the nature of these animals, I knew that it was\r\nnot improbable that they might do this.\r\n\r\n\"At first I was determined not to fire at them, thinking that after a\r\nwhile their fury might subside, and they would disperse.  Frank and I,\r\ntherefore, climbed a little higher; and concealed ourselves, as well as\r\nwe could, in the thick tufts of the moss.\r\n\r\n\"After remaining thus for above two hours, we saw that it was all to no\r\npurpose--for the peccaries, although they had become more quiet, still\r\nformed a dense circle around the tree, and appeared determined to carry\r\nout the siege.  Some of them had lain down--intending, no doubt, to take\r\nit as coolly and easily as possible--but not one had as yet left the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\n\"I grew impatient.  I knew that our people would be uneasy about our\r\nlong absence.  I feared, moreover, that Harry and Cudjo might come in\r\nsearch of us; and they, being on foot and not able to climb quickly\r\nenough to a tree, might fall victims to these fierce creatures.  I\r\ndetermined, therefore, at length to try what effect a shot or two might\r\nhave upon the herd.\r\n\r\n\"I again descended amongst the lowermost branches, to make sure of my\r\naim, and commenced firing.  Each time I selected an animal, aiming as\r\nnearly as I could for its heart.  I fired five times, and at every shot\r\none of the peccaries was seen to bite the dust; but the rest, instead of\r\nbeing frightened by the fearful havoc I was making among them, only\r\ntrampled over the bodies of their dead companions, grunting more\r\nfiercely than ever, and rushing against the trunk with their hoofed\r\nfeet, as though they would climb up it.\r\n\r\n\"As I returned to load my rifle for the sixth time, I found to my\r\nconsternation that I had but one bullet left!  This I rammed into the\r\ngun, which I again discharged among the peccaries, and another of them\r\nlay stretched upon the ground.  But all to no purpose was this\r\nslaughter--the animals seemed to be quite regardless of death.\r\n\r\n\"I knew of no other method to drive them away, and I now returned to the\r\nupper branches where I had left my companion, and sat down beside him.\r\nWe could do no more than wait with patience--in hopes that the night\r\nmight call off our strange besiegers.  Although we could hear them below\r\nus, still uttering their wild cries, and scratching against the trunk of\r\nthe tree, we now paid them no more attention, but sat quietly upon our\r\nperch, confiding in the hand of Providence to deliver us.\r\n\r\n\"We had been seated thus but a very short while, when all at once we\r\nbecame conscious that there was a bitter smoke rising around us.  At\r\nfirst we had taken it for the smoke which had been produced by the\r\nfiring of the rifle and which had hung for some time about the tree.\r\nNow we knew it could not be that, for it was growing thicker and\r\nthicker, and we noticed that it had a smell very different from that of\r\nburnt powder.  Moreover, it produced a stifling, choking sensation,\r\ncausing us to cough, and rub our eyes with the pain.  On looking\r\ndownward, I was unable to see either the ground or the peccaries; but I\r\ncould perceive a thick cloud rising up all around the tree.  I could\r\nhear the voices of the fierce brutes, loud as ever; but they appeared to\r\nbe scattering outward, and their cry was different to what it had\r\nhitherto been.  It now occurred to me that the moss had caught fire from\r\nthe wadding of my rifle; and this soon proved to be the fact, for the\r\nsmoke all at at once became illuminated with a bright blaze that seemed\r\nto spread almost instantaneously over the surface of the ground.  We saw\r\nthat it did not fully envelope the tree, but burned on that side where\r\nwe had thrown down large quantities of the moss.\r\n\r\n\"My companion and I scrambled out on the branches to the opposite side--\r\ngoing as far as we could to avoid the smoke.  We feared, all the while,\r\nthat the hanging mass, or even the tree itself, might catch fire, and\r\nforce us to leap into the midst of our enemies.  Fortunately, however,\r\nwe had clean stripped those branches that hung directly over the blazing\r\nheap; and as yet the flames did not mount high enough to reach the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\"When we had crawled beyond the blinding smoke, we could distinguish the\r\npeccaries, standing in a thick mass at some distance from the tree, and\r\nevidently somewhat terrified by the fire.  `Now,' thought I, `we shall\r\nbe delivered from them.  They will go off far enough to enable us to\r\nescape through the smoke;' and with this intention, I commenced\r\nreconnoitring the ground in the direction in which the thick clouds were\r\ncarried by the wind.  I concluded that none of the animals had gone in\r\nthis direction; and I saw that if we could leap down without being seen,\r\nwe might make off through the trees.  We were about descending upon a\r\nlower limb to carry out this purpose, when a sound like the distant\r\nyelping of dogs broke upon our ears.  It filled us at once with a\r\nterrible foreboding.  We knew that it must be our own dogs; and we knew\r\nthat Harry or Cudjo, or perhaps both, would be coming close upon their\r\nheels.  I knew that the dogs would soon be killed by the herd, and then\r\npoor Harry--he would be at once torn in pieces!  This was a fearful\r\nthought, and Frank and I paused a moment, with palpitating hearts, to\r\nlisten.  Yes, it was the dogs!  We could hear them yelping and barking\r\nat intervals, and evidently coming nearer.  The next moment we could\r\nplainly distinguish voices, as of people following upon the track of the\r\ndogs.  The voices could be no other than those of Harry and Cudjo coming\r\nin search of us.  I was irresolute how to act.  Should I allow them to\r\ncome on, and while the dogs might keep the peccaries engaged for a\r\nmoment, shout out and warn them to take to the trees.  It then occurred\r\nto me that I might leave Frank where he was, and by making a sudden rush\r\nthrough the smoke, get nearer to Harry and Cudjo and give them warning\r\nbefore the peccaries could get up.  Fortunately their voices sounded in\r\nthe right direction, and I might reach them without being pursued at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"I did not hesitate a moment after forming this resolve; but, handing my\r\nempty rifle to Frank, and drawing my knife, I dropped down among the\r\nsmoking heaps of half-burnt moss.  I ran off the moment my feet touched\r\nthe ground; and, after going a distance of an hundred yards or so, I\r\ncame in sight of the dogs, and the next moment of Harry and Cudjo.  But\r\nat the same instant, on glancing back, I saw the whole herd of the\r\npeccaries rushing after me with shrill cries.  I had barely time to\r\nshout to Harry and Cudjo, and swing myself up to a branch, when the\r\nanimals were around me.  The others, seeing me climb, and also\r\nperceiving the cause, made to a tree; and the next moment I had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing both of them mount into its branches.  The dogs,\r\non the contrary, ran forward to meet the herd, and give them battle.\r\nThis did not last long, for as soon as they had encountered the sharp\r\nteeth of the peccaries they ran howling back to the tree where Harry and\r\nCudjo had taken shelter.  Fortunately for the dogs, poor brutes! there\r\nwere some low branches, to which, by the help of Cudjo, they were able\r\nto spring up.  Had it not been so, they would soon have suffered the\r\nfate of the cougar; for the peccaries, fiercely enraged in their short\r\nencounter with them, pursued them hotly, and surrounded the tree into\r\nwhich they had been lucky enough to climb.\r\n\r\n\"I was now left to myself.  From the position I occupied I could not see\r\nHarry, Cudjo, or the mastiffs; but I could see the black herd that was\r\naround them.  I could hear all that passed--the howling of the dogs--the\r\nvoices of Harry and Cudjo--the vengeful notes of the peccaries, all\r\nringing together in a wild concert.  Then I heard the crack of the\r\nlittle rifle, and I saw one of the animals tumble over upon the ground.\r\nI heard the shouts of Cudjo, and I could see the blade of his long spear\r\nlunging down a intervals among the dark bodies below.  I could see that\r\nit streamed with blood; and that numbers of the animals were falling to\r\nthe earth.  Again came the crack of Harry's rifle, again the loud\r\nbarking of the dogs, and again the shouts of Cudjo, as he stood upon the\r\nlowermost branches, and plied his terrible weapon.  And thus for some\r\nminutes raged the battle, until I could see the ground fairly strewed\r\nwith black and bleeding forms.  Only a few of the peccaries remained\r\nupon their feet; and these at length, becoming alarmed by the fearful\r\nslaughter of their companions, turned away from the tree, and fled into\r\nthe thick underwood.  It was plain that they were defeated, and would\r\nnot again molest us; and, feeling confident of this, we all descended\r\nfrom our trees, and made our way to the house as quickly as we could--so\r\nas to relieve the anxiety of my wife.\r\n\r\n\"Although we often afterwards met a few of the peccaries in our hunting\r\nexcursions--and had the fortune to capture some of their young--they\r\nnever from that time offered to attack us, but always endeavoured to\r\nescape.  It is the nature of this animal to fight bravely with an enemy\r\nuntil conquered, when it will in future always run at his approach.  In\r\nfact, there appeared to be but one herd of them in the valley; and as\r\nthat had been nearly destroyed, we found them afterwards both scarce and\r\nshy.\r\n\r\n\"Next day we returned, well armed, for our opossum and her young, which\r\nin our hurry we had quite forgotten.  We found, to our mortification,\r\nthat the cunning animal had gnawed off her fastenings, and escaped, with\r\nher whole brood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY TWO.\r\n\r\nAN ADVENTURE WITH DUSKY WOLVES.\r\n\r\n\"During that year we raised two crops of corn.  Neither one of them\r\nrequired as much as two months to bring it to maturity.  When we\r\ngathered our fall crop we found that we had twenty times the full of our\r\ncart--enough to serve us for a whole year, as well as to feed our\r\nanimals in the winter.\r\n\r\n\"Our second year was spent pretty much as the first.  We made our sugar\r\nin the spring, and planted a large quantity of corn.  We added to our\r\nstock of pets both deer and antelope; and among other animals we caught\r\nan old she-wolf, with a large brood of wolf-puppies at her heels.  I\r\nneed hardly tell you that we were constrained to kill the old one on\r\naccount of her savage disposition, but the young ones we kept and\r\nreared.  They grew up quite as tame as our own dogs, with whom they\r\nfraternised as if they had been of the same species.\r\n\r\n\"During the summer and winter we had several adventures in the trapping\r\nand killing of wild animals; but one of these adventures was of such a\r\nsingular and dangerous character, that you may feel interested in its\r\nnarration.\r\n\r\n\"It occurred in the dead of winter, when there was snow upon the ground;\r\nand, in fact, it was the severest winter we experienced during our\r\nsojourn in the valley.\r\n\r\n\"The lake was frozen over, and the ice was as smooth as glass.  Of\r\ncourse, we spent much of our time in skating about over its surface, as\r\nit gave us health and a good appetite.  Even Cudjo had taken a fancy for\r\nthis amusement, and was also one of the skaters Frank was fonder of it\r\nthan any of us, and was, in fact, the best skater in our community.\r\n\r\n\"One day, however, neither Cudjo nor I had gone out, but only Frank and\r\nHarry.  The rest of us were busy at some carpenter work within doors.\r\nWe could hear the merry laugh of the boys, and the ring of their skates,\r\nas they scoured over the smooth ice.\r\n\r\n\"All at once a cry reached our ears which we knew betokened the presence\r\nof some danger.\r\n\r\n\"`O Robert!' ejaculated my wife, `they have broken through the ice!'\r\n\r\n\"We all dropped what we held in our hands, and rushed for the door.  I\r\nseized a rope as I ran, while Cudjo laid hold of his long spear,\r\nthinking that that might best help us.  This was the work of a moment,\r\nand the next we were outside the house.  What was our astonishment to\r\nsee both the boys, away at the farthest end of the lake, still upon\r\ntheir feet, but skating toward us as fast as they could drive!  At the\r\nsame time our eyes rested upon a terrible object.  Close behind them\r\nupon the ice, and following at full gallop, was a pack of wolves!  They\r\nwere not the small prairie wolves--which either of the boys might have\r\nchased with a stick--but of a species known as the `great dusky wolf of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains.'  There were six of them in all.  Each of them was\r\ntwice the size of the prairie wolf; and their long dark bodies, gaunt\r\nwith hunger, and crested from head to tail with a high bristling mane,\r\ngave them a most fearful appearance.  They ran with their ears set back,\r\nand their jaws apart, so that we could see the red tongues and white\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n\"We did not halt a moment, but rushed onward for the lake.  I flung down\r\nthe rope, and seized hold of a large rail as I ran, while Cudjo hurried\r\nforward, brandishing his spear.  Mary, with presence of mind, turned\r\nback into the house for my rifle.\r\n\r\n\"I saw that Harry was foremost; and that the fierce pursuers were fast\r\nclosing upon Frank.  This was strange, for we knew that Frank was by far\r\nthe best skater.  We all called out to him, uttering confused shouts of\r\nencouragement.  Both were bearing themselves manfully, but Frank was\r\nmost in danger.  The wolves were upon his heels!  `O God! they will\r\ndevour him!'  I cried in my agony, expecting the next moment to see him\r\ntorn down upon the ice.  What was my joy at seeing him suddenly wheel,\r\nand dart off in a new direction, with a shout of triumph!  The wolves,\r\nthus nimbly eluded, now kept after Harry--who in turn, became the object\r\nof our anxiety.  In a moment they were upon him; but he, already warned\r\nby his brother, wheeled in a similar manner; while the fierce brutes,\r\ncarried along by the impetus of their race, swept to a considerable\r\ndistance upon the ice before they could turn themselves.  Their long\r\ntails, however, soon enabled them to veer around in the new direction;\r\nand they galloped after Harry, who was now the nearest to them.  Frank,\r\nin the meantime, had again turned, and came sweeping past behind them--\r\nuttering loud shouts, as if to tempt them from their pursuit of Harry.\r\nThey heeded him not, and again he changed his direction; and, as though\r\nhe was about to skate into their midst, followed the wolves.  This time\r\nhe shaved up close behind them, just at the moment Harry had made his\r\nsecond angle and escaped.\r\n\r\n\"At this juncture we heard Frank calling out to his brother to make for\r\nthe shore; while, instead of retreating, he poised himself upon his\r\nskates, until Harry had passed; and then dashed off, followed by the\r\nwhole pack.  Another slight turn brought him nearly in our direction.\r\n\r\n\"There was a large hole broken through the ice close by the shore; and\r\nwe saw that, unless he turned again, he would skate into it!  We thought\r\nhe was watching the wolves too intently to see it, and we shouted to\r\nwarn him.  Not so: he knew better than we what he was about.  When he\r\nhad reached within a few feet of the hole, he wheeled sharply to the\r\nleft, and came dashing up to the point where we stood to receive him.\r\nThe wolves, following in a close clump, and too intent upon their chase\r\nto see anything else, went sweeping past the angle; and the next moment\r\nplunged into the broken ice!\r\n\r\n\"Cudjo and I ran shouting forward, and with the heavy rail and long\r\nspear commenced dealing death amongst them.  It was but a short, though\r\nexciting scene.  Five of them were speared and drowned; while the sixth\r\nsucceeded in crawling out upon the ice, and was making off, frightened\r\nenough at the cold ducking he had got.  I thought he was going to escape\r\nus, but at that moment I heard the crack of a rifle from behind; and the\r\nwolf tumbled over, howling like a shot hound.  On turning around, I saw\r\nHarry with my rifle, which Mary had brought down during the encounter,\r\nand which she had intrusted to Harry as a better marksman than herself.\r\nThe wolf was still only wounded, kicking furiously about upon the ice;\r\nbut Cudjo now ran out, and, after a short struggle, finished the\r\nbusiness with his spear.\r\n\r\n\"That was a day of great excitement in our little community.  Frank, who\r\nwas the hero of the day, although he said nothing, was not a little\r\nproud of his skating feat.  And well might be, as, but for his\r\nmanoeuvres, poor Harry would undoubtedly have fallen a prey to the\r\nfierce wolves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY THREE.\r\n\r\nTAMING THE GREAT ELK.\r\n\r\n\"In the third year our beavers had increased to such numbers, that we\r\nsaw it was time to thin them off, and commence laying up our store of\r\nfurs.  They had grown so tame that they would take food from our hands.\r\nWe had no difficulty, therefore, in capturing those we intended to kill,\r\nwithout giving alarm to the others.  For this purpose we constructed a\r\nsort of penn, or bye-pool, with raised mud banks, near the edge of the\r\nlake, and a sluice-gate leading into it.  Here we were accustomed to\r\nfeed the animals; and whenever a quantity of roots of the swamp\r\nsassafras was thrown into the pool, a large number of the beavers\r\ncrowded into it--so that we had nothing else to do but shut down the\r\nsluice-gate, and catch them at our leisure.  We accomplished all this\r\nvery quietly; and as none that we trapped were ever allowed to go back\r\nand `tell the tale,' and as at all other seasons the trap was open and\r\nfree, of course the surviving beavers, with all their sagacity, never\r\nknew what became of their companions, and did not even appear to suspect\r\nus of foul play, but remained tame as ever.\r\n\r\n\"In our first crop of skins we laid by, at least 450 pounds worth, with\r\nmore than 50 pounds worth of `castoreum.'  In our second year we were\r\nenabled to do still better; and the produce of that season we estimate\r\nat 1000 pounds.  Wanting a place to dry and store our furs, we built a\r\nnew log-cabin, which is the one we are now living in.  The old one\r\nbecame our store-house.\r\n\r\n\"The third year of our trapping was quite as productive as the second;\r\nand so with the fourth and fifth.  Each of them yielded, at least, 1000\r\npounds worth of furs and `castoreum;' so that our old cabin now contains\r\n4500 pounds of property, which we have taken care to keep in good\r\ncondition.  Besides, we estimate our livestock in the dam, which we can\r\ntrap at any time, at 2500 pounds more; so that, you see, we are worth in\r\nall 7000 pounds at this moment.  Do you not think, my friends, that we\r\nhave realised the prediction of my wife, and _made a fortune in the\r\nDesert_?\r\n\r\n\"As soon as we began to collect these valuable furs, a new train of\r\nthought was suggested to us--when and how we should bring them to a\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\"Here was a grand difficulty that stared us in the face.  Without a\r\nmarket in which to dispose of them, our furs would be of no more use to\r\nus, than a bag of gold would be to a man dying with hunger in the middle\r\nof a desert.  Although surrounded with plenty for all our wants and\r\nnecessities, we were still, in a manner, imprisoned in our little valley\r\noasis.  We could no more leave it, than the castaway sailor could leave\r\nhis desert island.  With all the animals that were subject to us, none\r\nof them were beasts of burden or draught--that is, except Pompo.  He was\r\nold at the time that these reflections first occurred to us; and when we\r\nshould be ready to leave our valley in a few years more, poor Pompo\r\nwould be still older; in fact, barely able to carry himself, let alone a\r\nwhole family of people, with several thousand beaver-skins to boot.\r\n\r\n\"Although quite happy where we were--for we were always too much\r\noccupied to be otherwise--these thoughts would intrude upon us every now\r\nand then, and they gave us a good deal of anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"As for Mary and myself, I believe we should have been contented to\r\nremain where we were, and lay our bones in this lovely, but lonely spot.\r\nBut we had others to think of--our children.  To them we had a duty to\r\nperform--the duty of their education.  We could not think of bringing\r\nthem up ignorant of the world; and leaving them to such a wild and\r\nwayward fate as would be theirs.  These reflections, I have said, at\r\ntimes pressed heavily upon us.\r\n\r\n\"I proposed to my wife that I should take Pompo, and endeavour to\r\npenetrate the settlements of New Mexico--where I could obtain either\r\nmules, horses, or oxen.  These I should bring back to our valley, and\r\nkeep them until we required them for carrying us out of the Desert.\r\nMary would not listen to this proposal.  She would not consent that we\r\nshould be separated.  `We might never,' said she, `see each other\r\nagain.'  She would not allow me to go.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, when I reflected seriously on this matter I saw that it would\r\nhave been useless for me to make the attempt.  Even could I have crossed\r\nthe Desert in safety, where was the money wherewith to purchase these\r\nanimals?  I had not enough to buy either ox or ass.  The people of New\r\nMexico would have laughed at me.\r\n\r\n\"`Let us be patient,' advised my wife.  `We are happy where we are.\r\nWhen the time arrives, and we are ready to go forth, trust that the hand\r\nwhich brought us here _can_ and _will_ guide us safely back again.'\r\n\r\n\"With such words of consolation my noble wife always ended our\r\nconversation on that subject.\r\n\r\n\"I looked upon her words as almost prophetic; and so they proved in this\r\ncase, as on many other occasions.\r\n\r\n\"One day--it was about the fourth year of our sojourn in the valley--we\r\nwere talking on this very theme; and Mary, as usual, had just expressed\r\nher firm reliance upon the hand of Providence to deliver us from our\r\nstrange captivity, when our conversation was interrupted by Harry, who\r\ncame running into the house breathless with haste, and with looks full\r\nof triumph.\r\n\r\n\"`Papa! mamma!' cried he; `two elks--two young elks--taken in the trap!\r\nCudjo is bringing them on in the cart,--two beautiful young elks, about\r\nas big as year-old calves.'\r\n\r\n\"There was nothing very new or strange in this announcement.  We had\r\ncaptured elk in the pit-fall before; and we had several of them in our\r\npark--old ones.  It was the fact of their being `young elk,'--a sort we\r\nhad not yet taken--which had put Harry into an unusual state of\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\"I thought nothing of it at the moment, but went out along with Mary and\r\nthe children to have a look at our new pets.\r\n\r\n\"While Cudjo and the boys were engaged in putting them into the park,\r\nall at once I remembered what I had read of, but which had hitherto\r\nescaped my memory--that the great American elk is capable of being\r\ntrained as a beast either of draught or burden.\r\n\r\n\"I need hardly tell you, my friends, that this thought at once led to a\r\nseries of reflections.  Could these elk be trained to draw a wagon?--to\r\n_draw us out of the Desert_?\r\n\r\n\"I lost no time in communicating my thoughts to my wife.  She, too, had\r\nread of this--in fact, in a London menagerie, had seen the elk in\r\nharness.  The thing, therefore, was practicable.  We resolved to use\r\nevery effort to make it so.\r\n\r\n\"Let me not weary you, my friends, with details.  We set to work to\r\ntrain our young elk.  No man knew better than Cudjo how to break a pair\r\nof oxen to either plough or cart; and when the elk had grown big, Cudjo\r\nyoked them to the plough, and turned up several acres of ground with\r\nthem.  During the winter, too, many a good load of dead-wood did Cudjo\r\nmake them `haul' up to the wood-pile that supplied our fire.  In short,\r\nthey worked, both in the plough and cart, as gentle as oxen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nCATCHING THE WILD HORSES.\r\n\r\n\"We had accomplished a great object.  Nothing remained but to train a\r\nsufficient number of elk for our purpose.  We trapped several fawns; and\r\nCudjo proceeded in breaking them as he had done the others.\r\n\r\n\"At this time, however, an event occurred which verified my wife's\r\nprediction still more clearly, and proved that the hand of God was over\r\nand around us.\r\n\r\n\"One morning, a little after daybreak, and just before we had risen, we\r\nwere all thrown into a state of consternation by a noise that came from\r\nwithout.  It was the trampling of hoofs--of many hoofs; and there was no\r\ndifficulty in perceiving that horses were about the house.  Their\r\nneighing proved this--for Pompo had neighed in his stable, and we could\r\nhear a dozen of them uttering their loud responses.\r\n\r\n\"`Indians!' thought we: and we gave ourselves up for lost.\r\n\r\n\"We all ran to our arms.  Harry, Frank, and I, seized hold of our\r\nrifles, while Cudjo betook himself to his great spear.  I opened one of\r\nthe windows, and looked cautiously out.  Horses they were, sure enough,\r\nbut no horsemen!  There they were--in all nearly a dozen of them--white,\r\nblack, red, speckled and spotted like hounds!  They were dashing about\r\nthrough the open ground, neighing, snorting, rearing at each other, and\r\ntossing back their long flowing manes, while their tails swept away\r\nbehind them in beautiful luxuriance.  There were they, without bridle or\r\nsaddle, or any other sign that the hand of man had ever touched them.\r\nAnd never had it.  I saw at a glance what they were.  They were\r\n_mustangs_--the wild horses of the Desert.\r\n\r\n\"We were not long in resolving how to act.  It was evident they had come\r\nup the stream from the eastern plains; and, seeing the valley, had been\r\ntempted by its greenness, and had strayed into it.  Our design, then,\r\nwas at once formed, and that was to prevent them from getting out again.\r\n\r\n\"This could be accomplished very easily, by closing up the road which\r\nled down to the valley; but, then, how were we to get to it without\r\ngiving them the alarm?  They were playing directly in front of the\r\nhouse, and we could not pass out of the door without showing ourselves.\r\nThis would at once set them off in a wild gallop, and we should never\r\nsee more of them.  We knew they would not allow us to approach them--for\r\nwe had seen several bands of them while crossing the prairies, and these\r\nwould not allow our hunters to get within less than a mile of them.\r\nThis is a curious fact--that the horse, which you would suppose to be\r\nthe natural companion of man--once he has escaped from captivity, and\r\ngoes wild, becomes more shy of man than any other animal, and more\r\ndifficult to be approached.  He seems to have an idea of what is wanted\r\nwith him, and is determined not to return to slavery.  I have never seen\r\na drove of wild horses, but the thought occurred to me, that there was\r\nsome old `runaway' among them, who told the rest how he had been used,\r\nand cautioned them to keep clear of us.  Certain it is, that the wild\r\nhorse is the wildest of all animals.\r\n\r\n\"How, then, were we to get out, and circumvent the drove?  That was soon\r\ndecided.  Telling Cudjo to take his axe and follow me, I climbed out at\r\nthe back window of our cabin; and keeping the house between us and the\r\nhorses, we crept along past our store-house and stable, until we got\r\ninto the woods in the rear.  We skirted through the timber, and soon\r\nreached the point where the road runs out of the valley.  Here Cudjo set\r\nlustily to work with his axe; and in half an hour we had felled a tree\r\nacross the track, completely blocking it up.  We took care to make it\r\nsecure, by adding several rails, in such a way that no horse without\r\nwings could have leaped over it.  This done, we gave ourselves no\r\nfarther concern about being seen by the mustangs; and, shouldering our\r\nimplements, we marched leisurely back to the house.  Of course, the\r\nmoment the wild horses saw us, they galloped off into the woods; but we\r\ndid not care for that, as we could easily find them again.  And find\r\nthem we did.  Pompo was saddled and bridled; a lazo was made out of\r\nraw-hide ropes; and in less than three days the whole _caballada_ of\r\nwild horses--eleven in all--was shut up in our park.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my friends, I fear I have quite tired you with our adventures.  I\r\nmight relate many more, and perhaps, at some future time, may do so.  I\r\nmight tell you how we caught and tamed the wild sheep and the\r\nantelopes;--how we captured the young buffaloes on the upper plains, and\r\ntamed them, and made cheese and butter from their milk;--how we reared\r\nup the kittens of the cougar and the cubs of the black bear;--how the\r\nwild geese, and swans, and cranes, and pelicans, migrated to our lake,\r\nand became quite tame with us;--how Cudjo and I with our horses made a\r\njourney across the Desert to the `Camp of Sorrow,' as we called the\r\nplace where our friends had been massacred;--how we picked out two of\r\nthe best of the wagons, and with the gunpowder which we took from the\r\nbomb-shells and many other useful articles, returned again to our\r\nvalley.  These, and many other adventures with wolves and wolverenes,\r\nwith panthers and peccaries, and porcupines and opossums, I might detail\r\nto you; but no doubt you are already wearied with the length of my\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\"It is now nearly ten years since our arrival in this valley oasis.\r\nDuring all that time, we have lived contented and happy; and God has\r\nfavoured our efforts, and crowned them with success.  But our children\r\nhave grown up almost wild, as you see,--with no other education than\r\nthat which we ourselves have been able to impart to them; and we are\r\nanxious on their account once more to return to the civilised world.  It\r\nis our intention then to proceed to Saint Louis in the spring.  For this\r\npurpose, we have everything ready--our wagons, and horses, and furs--all\r\nexcept those which we intend to trap in the ensuing winter.  I know not\r\nwhether we may ever return to this sweet spot--though it will be always\r\ndear to us from a thousand memories.  That will depend upon\r\ncircumstances arising in the future, and which we cannot now foresee.\r\nIt is our intention, however, on leaving the valley, to throw open their\r\nbars and set all our captives free--to let them return once more to\r\ntheir wild independence.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my friends, I have but one request to make of you.  It is late\r\nin the season.  You have lost your trail; and, as you all know, it is\r\nvery perilous to attempt crossing the prairies in winter.  Remain with\r\nme, then, until spring; and let us all go together.  The winter will be\r\na short one; and I shall endeavour to make it pass pleasantly for you.\r\nI can promise you plenty of hunting adventures; and, when the proper\r\nseason arrives, we shall have a grand _battue_ of the beavers.  Speak,\r\nthen!  What say you to remain?\"\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI need hardly tell you, my young reader, that we at once accepted the\r\nproposal.  Our friend McKnight, would of course remain on account of the\r\nlittle Luisa; and as for the rest of us, we knew well the hardships we\r\nshould have to encounter, should we travel the great plains during\r\nwinter.  We knew that in that latitude, as Rolfe had said, the winter\r\nwould be a short one; and therefore we should not lose much time by\r\nstaying until spring.  The strange wild life which we should lead, had\r\ncharms for all of us, and we willingly consented to remain.\r\n\r\nAs Rolfe promised, we had many hunting adventures; and among the rest,\r\nthe _battue_ of beavers--nearly two thousand of which were trapped and\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nAs soon as spring arrived, we made ready to set forth.  Three wagons\r\nwere prepared--two of them loaded with furs and valuable castoreum.  The\r\nthird carried the females--while Rolfe and his sons rode upon horseback.\r\nThe walls of the deer-park were broken down, and the aviaries thrown\r\nopen; and, after distributing plenty of food to the numerous pets, we\r\nleft them to themselves, and took our departure from the valley.  We\r\nstruck northward for the old trail; and on reaching it, turned our faces\r\nfor Saint Louis--where we arrived in the month of May; and where Rolfe\r\nsoon after sold his furs for a large sum of money.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt is now several years since that time; and during the interval, I--the\r\nwriter of this little book--living in a distant country, heard nothing\r\nmore about Rolfe or his family.  A few days ago, however, I received a\r\nletter from Rolfe himself, which gave me the gratifying intelligence\r\nthat they were all well, and in excellent spirits.  Frank and Harry had\r\njust finished their college studies, and had come out accomplished\r\nscholars and sterling men.  Mary and Luisa--Luisa was still one of the\r\nfamily--had returned from school.  Besides this, Rolfe's letter\r\ncontained some _very_ interesting intelligence.  No less than _four_\r\nmarriages were in contemplation in his family.  Harry was about to wed\r\nthe little \"dark sister,\" Luisa.  Frank had come to an understanding\r\nwith a fine young lady, the daughter of a Missouri planter; and the\r\nfair-haired, blue-eyed, rosy-lipped Mary had enslaved a young \"prairie\r\nmerchant,\" one of those who had spent the winter with us in the valley\r\noasis, and who had been very gallant to Mary all along the journey\r\nhomeward.  But who were to be the fourth couple?  Ah! that question we\r\nmust leave for Cudjo and his \"lubbly Lucy\" to answer.\r\n\r\nRolfe's letter farther informed me, that it was their intention--as soon\r\nas the marriage festivities were over--to return to the valley oasis.\r\nAll were going together--McKnight, new-married couples, and all.  They\r\nwere to take with them many wagons, with horses, and cattle, and\r\nimplements of husbandry--with the intention of settling there for life,\r\nand forming a little patriarchal colony of themselves.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasant letter to read: and as I perused it over and over, and\r\nreflected on the many happy hours I had passed in the company of these\r\ngood people, I could not help thanking the fate that first led me to the\r\n_Home in the Desert_.\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
