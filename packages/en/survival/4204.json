The present work, however, is the outcome of\r\nthe need of a text-book of very simple outline, in which causes\r\nand their consequences should be knit together as closely as\r\npossible,--a need long felt by the author in his teaching, and\r\nperhaps by other teachers also. The author has ventured,\r\ntherefore, to depart from the common usage which subdivides\r\ngeology into a number of departments,--dynamical, structural,\r\nphysiographic, and historical,--and to treat in immediate\r\nconnection with each geological process the land forms and the\r\nrock structures which it has produced.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the facts of geology and the inferences drawn\r\nfrom them have been so presented as to afford an efficient\r\ndiscipline in inductive reasoning. Typical examples have been used\r\nto introduce many topics, and it has been the author's aim to give\r\ndue proportion to both the wide generalizations of our science and\r\nto the concrete facts on which they rest.\r\n\r\nThere have been added a number of practical exercises such as the\r\nauthor has used for several years in the class room. These are not\r\nmade so numerous as to displace the problems which no doubt many\r\nteachers prefer to have their pupils solve impromptu during the\r\nrecitation, but may, it is hoped, suggest their use.\r\n\r\nIn historical geology a broad view is given of the development of\r\nthe North American continent and the evolution of life upon the\r\nplanet. Only the leading types of plants and animals are\r\nmentioned, and special attention is given to those which mark the\r\nlines of descent of forms now living.\r\n\r\nBy omitting much technical detail of a mineralogical and\r\npaleontological nature, and by confining the field of view almost\r\nwholly to our own continent, space has been obtained to give to\r\nwhat are deemed for beginners the essentials of the science a\r\nfuller treatment than perhaps is common.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that field work will be introduced with the\r\ncommencement of the study. The common rocks are therefore briefly\r\ndescribed in the opening chapters. The drift also receives early\r\nmention, and teachers in the northern states who begin geology in\r\nthe fall may prefer to take up the chapter on the Pleistocene\r\nimmediately after the chapter on glaciers.\r\n\r\nSimple diagrams have been used freely, not only because they are\r\noften clearer than any verbal statement, but also because they\r\nreadily lend themselves to reproduction on the blackboard by the\r\npupil. The text will suggest others which the pupil may invent. It\r\nis hoped that the photographic views may also be used for\r\nexercises in the class room.\r\n\r\nThe generous aid of many friends is recognized with special\r\npleasure. To Professor W. M. Davis of Harvard University there is\r\nowing a large obligation for the broad conceptions and luminous\r\nstatements of geologic facts and principles with which he has\r\nenriched the literature of our science, and for his stimulating\r\ninfluence in education. It is hoped that both in subject-matter\r\nand in method the book itself makes evident this debt. But besides\r\na general obligation shared by geologists everywhere, and in\r\nvarying degrees by perhaps all authors of recent American text-\r\nbooks in earth science, there is owing a debt direct and personal.\r\nThe plan of the book, with its use of problems and treatment of\r\nland forms and rock structures in immediate connection with the\r\nprocesses which produce them, was submitted to Professor Davis,\r\nand, receiving his approval, was carried into effect, although\r\nwithout the sanction of precedent at the time. Professor Davis\r\nalso kindly consented to read the manuscript throughout, and his\r\nmany helpful criticisms and suggestions are acknowledged with\r\nsincere gratitude.\r\n\r\nParts of the manuscript have been reviewed by Dr. Samuel Calvin\r\nand Dr. Frank M. Wilder of the State University of Iowa; Dr. S. W.\r\nBeyer of the Iowa College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts; Dr. U.\r\nS. Grant of Northwestern University; Professor J. A. Udden of\r\nAugustana College, Illinois; Dr. C. H. Gordon of the New Mexico\r\nState School of Mines; Principal Maurice Ricker of the High\r\nSchool, Burlington, Iowa; and the following former students of the\r\nauthor who are engaged in the earth sciences: Dr. W. C. Alden of\r\nthe United States Geological Survey and the University of Chicago;\r\nMr. Joseph Sniffen, instructor in the Academy of the University of\r\nChicago, Morgan Park; Professor Martin Iorns, Fort Worth\r\nUniversity, Texas; Professor A. M. Jayne, Dakota University;\r\nProfessor G. H. Bretnall, Monmouth College, Illinois; Professor\r\nHoward E. Simpson, Colby College, Maine; Mr. E. J. Cable,\r\ninstructor in the Iowa State Normal College; Principal C. C. Gray\r\nof the High School, Fargo, North Dakota; and Mr. Charles Persons\r\nof the High School, Hannibal, Missouri. A large number of the\r\ndiagrams of the book were drawn by Mr. W. W. White of the Art\r\nSchool of Cornell College. To all these friends, and to the many\r\nwho have kindly supplied the illustrations of the text, whose\r\nnames are mentioned in an appended list, the writer returns his\r\nheartfelt thanks.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HARMON NORTON\r\n\r\nCORNELL COLLEGE, MOUNT VERNON, IOWA\r\n\r\nJULY, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nDuring the preparation of this book Professor Norton has\r\nfrequently discussed its plan with me by correspondence, and we\r\nhave considered together the matters of scope, arrangement, and\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\nAs to scope, the needs of the young student and not of the expert\r\nhave been our guide; the book is therefore a text-book, not a\r\nreference volume.\r\n\r\nIn arrangement, the twofold division of the subject was chosen\r\nbecause of its simplicity and effectiveness. The principles of\r\nphysical geology come first; the several chapters are arranged in\r\nwhat is believed to be a natural order, appropriate to the\r\ngreatest part of our country, so that from a simple beginning a\r\nlogical sequence of topics leads through the whole subject. The\r\nhistorical view of the science comes second, with many specific\r\nillustrations of the physical processes previously studied, but\r\nnow set forth as part of the story of the earth, with its many\r\nchanges of aspect and its succession of inhabitants. Special\r\nattention is here given to North America, and care is taken to\r\navoid overloading with details.\r\n\r\nWith respect to method of presentation, it must not be forgotten\r\nthat the text-book is only one factor in good teaching, and that\r\nin geology, as in other sciences, the teacher, the laboratory, and\r\nthe local field are other factors, each of which should play an\r\nappropriate part. The text suggests observational methods, but it\r\ncannot replace observation in field or laboratory; it offers\r\ncertain exercises, but space cannot be taken to make it a\r\nlaboratory manual as well as a book for study; it explains many\r\nproblems, but its statements are necessarily more terse than the\r\nillustrative descriptions that a good and experienced teacher\r\nshould supply. Frequent use is made of induction and inference in\r\norder that the student may come to see how reasonable a science is\r\ngeology, and that he may avoid the too common error of thinking\r\nthat the opinions of \"authorities\" are reached by a private road\r\nthat is closed to him. The further extension of this method of\r\npresentation is urged upon the teacher, so that the young\r\ngeologist may always learn the evidence that leads to a\r\nconclusion, and not only the conclusion itself.\r\n\r\nW.

It learns from\r\ntheir composition and structure how the rocks were made and how\r\nthey have been modified. It ascertains how they have been brought\r\nto their present places and wrought to their various topographic\r\nforms, such as hills and valleys, plains and mountains. It studies\r\nthe vestiges which the rocks preserve of ancient organisms which\r\nonce inhabited our planet. Geology is the history of the earth and\r\nits inhabitants, as read in the rocks of the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a general idea of the nature and method of our science\r\nbefore beginning its study in detail, we may visit some valley,\r\nsuch as that illustrated in the frontispiece, on whose sides are\r\nrocky ledges. Here the rocks lie in horizontal layers. Although\r\nonly their edges are exposed, we may infer that these layers run\r\ninto the upland on either side and underlie the entire district;\r\nthey are part of the foundation of solid rock which everywhere is\r\nfound beneath the loose materials of the surface.\r\n\r\nThe ledges of the valley of our illustration are of sandstone.\r\nLooking closely at the rock we see that it is composed of myriads\r\nof grains of sand cemented together. These grains have been worn\r\nand rounded. They are sorted also, those of each layer being about\r\nof a size. By some means they have been brought hither from some\r\nmore ancient source. Surely these grains have had a history before\r\nthey here found a resting place,--a history which we are to learn\r\nto read.\r\n\r\nThe successive layers of the rock suggest that they were built one\r\nafter another from the bottom upward. We may be as sure that each\r\nlayer was formed before those above it as that the bottom courses\r\nof stone in a wall were laid before the courses which rest upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe have no reason to believe that the lowest layers which we see\r\nhere were the earliest ever formed. Indeed, some deep boring in\r\nthe vicinity may prove that the ledges rest upon other layers of\r\nrock which extend downward for many hundreds of feet below the\r\nvalley floor. Nor may we conclude that the highest layers here\r\nwere the latest ever laid; for elsewhere we may find still later\r\nlayers lying upon them.\r\n\r\nA short search may find in the rock relics of animals, such as the\r\nimprints of shells, which lived when it was deposited; and as\r\nthese are of kinds whose nearest living relatives now have their\r\nhome in the sea, we infer that it was on the flat sea floor that\r\nthe sandstone was laid. Its present position hundreds of feet\r\nabove sea level proves that it has since emerged to form part of\r\nthe land; while the flatness of the beds shows that the movement\r\nwas so uniform and gentle as not to break or strongly bend them\r\nfrom their original attitude.\r\n\r\nThe surface of some of these layers is ripple-marked. Hence the\r\nsand must once have been as loose as that of shallow sea bottoms\r\nand sea beaches to-day, which is thrown into similar ripples by\r\nmovements of the water. In some way the grains have since become\r\ncemented into firm rock.\r\n\r\nNote that the layers on one side of the valley agree with those on\r\nthe other, each matching the one opposite at the same level. Once\r\nthey were continuous across the valley. Where the valley now is\r\nwas once a continuous upland built of horizontal layers; the\r\nlayers now show their edges, or OUTCROP, on the valley sides\r\nbecause they have been cut by the valley trench.\r\n\r\nThe rock of the ledges is crumbling away. At the foot of each step\r\nof rock lie fragments which have fallen. Thus the valley is slowly\r\nwidening. It has been narrower in the past; it will be wider in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nThrough the valley runs a stream. The waters of rains which have\r\nfallen on the upper parts of the stream's basin are now on their\r\nway to the river and the sea. Rock fragments and grains of sand\r\ncreeping down the valley slopes come within reach of the stream\r\nand are washed along by the running water. Here and there they\r\nlodge for a time in banks of sand and gravel, but sooner or later\r\nthey are taken up again and carried on. The grains of sand which\r\nwere brought from some ancient source to form these rocks are on\r\ntheir way to some new goal. As they are washed along the rocky bed\r\nof the stream they slowly rasp and wear it deeper. The valley will\r\nbe deeper in the future; it has been less deep in the past.\r\n\r\nIn this little valley we see slow changes now in progress. We find\r\nalso in the composition, the structure, and the attitude of the\r\nrocks, and the land forms to which they have been sculptured, the\r\nrecord of a long succession of past changes involving the origin\r\nof sand grains and their gathering and deposit upon the bottom of\r\nsome ancient sea, the cementation of their layers into solid rock,\r\nthe uplift of the rocks to form a land surface, and, last of all,\r\nthe carving of a valley in the upland. Everywhere, in the fields,\r\nalong the river, among the mountains, by the seashore, and in the\r\ndesert, we may discover slow changes now in progress and the\r\nrecord of similar changes in the past. Everywhere we may catch\r\nglimpses of a process of gradual change, which stretches backward\r\ninto the past and forward into the future, by which the forms and\r\nstructures of the face of the earth are continually built and\r\ncontinually destroyed. The science which deals with this long\r\nprocess is geology. Geology treats of the natural changes now\r\ntaking place upon the earth and within it, the agencies which\r\nproduce them, and the land forms and rock structures which result.\r\nIt studies the changes of the present in order to be able to read\r\nthe history of the earth's changes in the past.\r\n\r\nThe various agencies which have fashioned the face of the earth\r\nmay. be divided into two general classes. In Part I we shall\r\nconsider those which work upon the earth from without, such as the\r\nweather, running water, glaciers, the wind, and the sea. In Part\r\nII we shall treat of those agencies whose sources are within the\r\nearth, and among whose manifestations are volcanoes and\r\nearthquakes and the various movements of the earth's crust. As we\r\nstudy each agency we shall notice not only how it does its work,\r\nbut also the records which it leaves in the rock structures and\r\nthe land forms which it produces. With this preparation we shall\r\nbe able in Part III to read in the records of the rocks the\r\nhistory of our planet and the successive forms of life which have\r\ndwelt upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL GEOLOGICAL AGENCIES\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF THE WEATHER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed\r\na process which is going forward in all lands. Everywhere the\r\nrocks are crumbling away; their fragments are creeping down\r\nhillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the\r\nsea, where they are rebuilt into rocky layers. When again the\r\nrocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew; again\r\nthey will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams\r\nto the sea. Let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at\r\nthe point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of\r\nthe weather. In studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall\r\nlearn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away.\r\n\r\nSTRATIFICATION AND JOINTING. At the sandstone ledges we saw that\r\nthe rock was divided into parallel layers. The thicker layers are\r\nknown as STRATA, and the thin leaves into which each stratum may\r\nsometimes be split are termed LAMINAE. To a greater or less degree\r\nthese layers differ from each other in fineness of grain, showing\r\nthat the material has been sorted. The planes which divide them\r\nare called BEDDING PLANES.\r\n\r\nBesides the bedding planes there are other division planes, which\r\ncut across the strata from top to bottom. These are found in all\r\nrocks and are known as joints. Two sets of joints,\r\nrunning at about right angles to each other, together with the\r\nbedding planes, divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks.\r\n\r\nSANDSTONE. Examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of\r\ngrains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches. Most of\r\nthe grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz. These\r\nquartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife\r\nblade. They are not affected by acid, and their broken surfaces\r\nare irregular like those of broken glass.\r\n\r\nThe grains of sandstone are held together by some cement. This may\r\nbe calcareous, consisting of soluble carbonate of lime. In brown\r\nsandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous,--hydrated iron\r\noxide, or iron rust, forming the bond, somewhat as in the case of\r\niron nails which have rusted together. The strongest and most\r\nlasting cement is siliceous, and sand rocks whose grains are\r\nclosely cemented by silica, the chemical substance of which quartz\r\nis made, are known as quartzites.\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the\r\naction of the weather. On ledges where the rock is exposed to view\r\nits surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose\r\nand may be rubbed off with the finger. On gentle slopes the rock\r\nis covered with a soil composed of sand, which evidently is\r\ncrumbled sandstone, and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the\r\ndecay of vegetation. Clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement\r\nthat the rock thus breaks down to loose sand. A piece of sandstone\r\nwith calcareous cement, or a bit of old mortar, which is really an\r\nartificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime, may be\r\ntreated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nA LIMESTONE QUARRY. Here also we find the rock stratified and\r\njointed (Fig. 2). On the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen\r\nto be altered for some distance from its upper surface. Below the\r\naltered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building; but\r\nthe altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for\r\nthis purpose. If the limestone is laminated, the laminae here have\r\nsplit apart, although below they hold fast together. Near the\r\nsurface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch,\r\nwhile on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of\r\nlimestone meal, on which rests a fine reddish clay.\r\n\r\nLimestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly\r\nheld together by a calcareous cement. A piece of the stone placed\r\nin a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk\r\neffervescence, leaving the insoluble impurities, which were\r\ndisseminated through it, at the bottom of the tube as a little\r\nclay.\r\n\r\nWe can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the\r\nquarry. At the surface of the rock the limestone has completely\r\ndissolved, leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish\r\nclay. Immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into\r\nmeal where the cement between the limestone grains has been\r\nremoved, while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the\r\ncement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination\r\nwhere the stone is more porous. As these changes in the rock are\r\ngreatest at the surface and diminish downward, we infer that they\r\nhave been caused by agents working downward from the surface.\r\n\r\nAt certain points these agencies have been more effective than\r\nelsewhere. The upper rock surface is pitted. Joints are widened as\r\nthey approach the surface, and along these seams we may find that\r\nthe rock is altered even down to the quarry floor.\r\n\r\nA SHALE PIT. Let us now visit some pit where shale--a laminated\r\nand somewhat hardened clay--is quarried for the manufacture of\r\nbrick. The laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as\r\ncardboard in places, and close joints may break the rock into\r\nsmall rhombic blocks. On the upper surface we note that the shale\r\nhas weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure\r\nhave been destroyed. The clay and the upper layers of the shale\r\nbeneath it are reddish or yellow, while in many cases the color of\r\nthe unaltered rock beneath is blue.\r\n\r\nTHE SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. The three kinds of layered rocks whose\r\nacquaintance we have made--sandstone, limestone, and shale--are\r\nthe leading types of the great group of stratified, or\r\nsedimentary, rocks. This group includes all rocks made of\r\nsediments, their materials having settled either in water upon the\r\nbottoms of rivers, lakes, or seas, or on dry land, as in the case\r\nof deposits made by the wind and by glaciers. Sedimentary rocks\r\nare divided into the fragmental rocks--which are made of\r\nfragments, either coarse or fine--and the far less common rocks\r\nwhich are constituted of chemical precipitates.\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition\r\ninto the following classes:\r\n\r\n1. The arenaceous, or quartz rocks, including beds of loose sand\r\nand gravel, sandstone, quartzite, and conglomerate (a rock made of\r\ncemented rounded gravel or pebbles).\r\n\r\n2. The calcareous, or lime rocks, including limestone and a soft\r\nwhite rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk.\r\n\r\n3. The argillaceous, or clay rocks, including muds, clays, and\r\nshales. These three classes pass by mixture into one another. Thus\r\nthere are limy and clayey sandstones, sandy and clayey limestones,\r\nand sandy and limy shales.\r\n\r\nGRANITE. This familiar rock may be studied as an example of the\r\nsecond great group of rocks,--the unstratified, or igneous rocks.\r\nThese are not made of cemented sedimentary grains, but of\r\ninterlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass.\r\nExamining a piece of granite, the most conspicuous crystals which\r\nmeet the eye are those of feldspar. They are commonly pink, white,\r\nor yellow, and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect\r\nthe light like tiny panes of glass. Mica may be recognized by its\r\nglittering plates, which split into thin elastic scales. A third\r\nmineral, harder than steel, breaking along irregular surfaces like\r\nbroken glass, we identify as quartz.\r\n\r\nHow granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in\r\noutcrops where it forms the bed rock, or country rock, underlying\r\nthe loose formations of the surface, and in many parts of the\r\nnorthern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less\r\ndecayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the\r\ndrift. Of the different minerals composing granite, quartz alone\r\nremains unaltered. Mica weathers to detached flakes which have\r\nlost their elasticity. The feldspar crystals have lost their\r\nluster and hardness, and even have decayed to clay. Where long-\r\nweathered granite forms the country rock, it often may be cut with\r\nspade or trowel for several feet from the surface, so rotten is\r\nthe feldspar, and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey\r\nsoil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica.\r\n\r\nThese are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which\r\nsome of the common kinds of rocks undergo. The agencies by which\r\nthese changes are brought about we will now take up under two\r\ndivisions,--CHEMICAL AGENCIES producing rock decay and MECHANICAL\r\nAGENCIES producing rock disintegration.\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMICAL WORK OF WATER\r\n\r\nAs water falls on the earth in rain it has already absorbed from\r\nthe air carbon dioxide (carbonic acid gas) and oxygen. As it sinks\r\ninto the ground and becomes what is termed ground water, it takes\r\ninto solution from the soil humus acids and carbon dioxide, both\r\nof which are constantly being generated there by the decay of\r\norganic matter. So both rain and ground water are charged with\r\nactive chemical agents, by the help of which they corrode and rust\r\nand decompose all rocks to a greater or less degree. We notice now\r\nthree of the chief chemical processes concerned in weathering,--\r\nsolution, the formation of carbonates, and oxidation.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION. Limestone, although so little affected by pure water\r\nthat five thousand gallons would be needed to dissolve a single\r\npound, is easily dissolved in water charged with carbon dioxide.\r\nIn limestone regions well water is therefore \"hard.\" On boiling\r\nthe water for some time the carbon dioxide gas is expelled, the\r\nwhole of the lime carbonate can no longer be held in solution, and\r\nmuch of it is thrown down to form a crust or \"scale\" in the kettle\r\nor in the tubes of the steam boiler. All waters which flow over\r\nlimestone rocks or soak through them are constantly engaged in\r\ndissolving them away, and in the course of time destroy beds of\r\nvast extent and great thickness.\r\n\r\nThe upper surface of limestone rocks becomes deeply pitted, as we\r\nsaw in the limestone quarry, and where the mantle of waste has\r\nbeen removed it may be found so intricately furrowed that it is\r\ndifficult to traverse.\r\n\r\nBeds of rock salt buried among the strata are dissolved by seeping\r\nwater, which issues in salt springs. Gypsum, a mineral composed of\r\nhydrated sulphate of lime, and so soft that it may be scratched\r\nwith the finger nail, is readily taken up by water, giving to the\r\nwater of wells and springs a peculiar hardness difficult to\r\nremove.\r\n\r\nThe dissolving action of moisture may be noted on marble\r\ntombstones of some age, marble being a limestone altered by heat\r\nand pressure and composed of crystalline grains. By assuming that\r\nthe date on each monument marks the year of its erection, one may\r\nestimate how many years on the average it has taken for weathering\r\nto loosen fine grains on the polished surface, so that they may be\r\nrubbed off with the finger, to destroy the polish, to round the\r\nsharp edges of tool marks in the lettering, and at last to open\r\ncracks and seams and break down the stone. We may notice also\r\nwhether the gravestones weather more rapidly on the sunny or the\r\nshady side, and on the sides or on the top.\r\n\r\nThe weathered surface of granular limestone containing shells\r\nshows them standing in relief. As the shells are made of\r\ncrystalline carbonate of lime, we may infer whether the carbonate\r\nof lime is less soluble in its granular or in its crystalline\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nTHE FORMATION OF CARBONATES. In attacking minerals water does more\r\nthan merely take them into solution. It decomposes them, forming\r\nnew chemical compounds of which the carbonates are among the most\r\nimportant. Thus feldspar consists of the insoluble silicate of\r\nalumina, together with certain alkaline silicates which are broken\r\nup by the action of water containing carbon dioxide, forming\r\nalkaline carbonates. These carbonates are freely soluble and\r\ncontribute potash and soda to soils and river waters. By the\r\nremoval of the soluble ingredients of feldspar there is left the\r\nsilicate of alumina, united with water or hydrated, in the\r\ncondition of a fine plastic clay which, when white and pure, is\r\nknown as KAOLIN and is used in the manufacture of porcelain.\r\nFeldspathic rocks which contain no iron compounds thus weather to\r\nwhitish crusts, and even apparently sound crystals of feldspar,\r\nwhen ground to thin slices and placed under the microscope, may be\r\nseen to be milky in color throughout because an internal change to\r\nkaolin has begun.\r\n\r\nOXIDATION. Rocks containing compounds of iron weather to reddish\r\ncrusts, and the seams of these rocks are often lined with rusty\r\nfilms. Oxygen and water have here united with the iron, forming\r\nhydrated iron oxide. The effects of oxidation may be seen in the\r\nalteration of many kinds of rocks and in red and yellow colors of\r\nsoils and subsoils.\r\n\r\nPyrite is a very hard mineral of a pale brass color, found in\r\nscattered crystals in many rocks, and is composed of iron and\r\nsulphur (iron sulphide). Under the attack of the weather it takes\r\nup oxygen, forming iron sulphate (green vitriol), a soluble\r\ncompound, and insoluble hydrated iron oxide, which as a mineral is\r\nknown as limonite. Several large masses of iron sulphide were\r\nplaced some years ago on the lawn in front of the National Museum\r\nat Washington. The mineral changed so rapidly to green vitriol\r\nthat enough of this poisonous compound was washed into the ground\r\nto kill the roots of the surrounding grass.\r\n\r\nAGENTS OF MECHANICAL DISINTEGRATION\r\n\r\nHEAT AND COLD. Rocks exposed to the direct rays of the sun become\r\nstrongly heated by day and expand. After sunset they rapidly cool\r\nand contract. When the difference in temperature between day and\r\nnight is considerable, the repeated strains of sudden expansion\r\nand contraction at last become greater than the rocks can bear,\r\nand they break, for the same reason that a glass cracks when\r\nplunged into boiling water (Fig. 5).\r\n\r\nRocks are poor conductors of heat, and hence their surfaces may\r\nbecome painfully hot under the full blaze of the sun, while the\r\ninterior remains comparatively cool. By day the surface shell\r\nexpands and tends to break loose from the mass of the stone. In\r\ncooling in the evening the surface shell suddenly contracts on the\r\nunyielding interior and in time is forced off in scales.\r\n\r\nMany rocks, such as granite, are made up of grains of various\r\nminerals which differ in color and in their capacity to absorb\r\nheat, and which therefore contract and expand in different ratios.\r\nIn heating and cooling these grains crowd against their neighbors\r\nand tear loose from them, so that finally the rock disintegrates\r\ninto sand.\r\n\r\nThe conditions for the destructive action of heat and cold are\r\nmost fully met in arid regions when vegetation is wanting for lack\r\nof sufficient rain. The soil not being held together by the roots\r\nof plants is blown away over large areas, leaving the rocks bare\r\nto the blazing sun in a cloudless sky. The air is dry, and the\r\nheat received by the earth by day is therefore rapidly radiated at\r\nnight into space. There is a sharp and sudden fall of temperature\r\nafter sunset, and the rocks, strongly heated by day, are now\r\nchilled perhaps even to the freezing point.\r\n\r\nIn the Sahara the thermometer has been known to fall 131 degrees\r\nF. within a few hours. In the light air of the Pamir plateau in\r\ncentral Asia a rise of 90 degrees F. has been recorded from seven\r\no'clock in the morning to one o'clock in the afternoon. On the\r\nmountains of southwestern Texas there are frequently heard\r\ncrackling noises as the rocks of that arid region throw off scales\r\nfrom a fraction of an inch to four inches in thickness, and loud\r\nreports are made as huge bowlders split apart. Desert pebbles\r\nweakened by long exposure to heat and cold have been shivered to\r\nfine sharp-pointed fragments on being placed in sand heated to 180\r\ndegrees F. Beds half a foot thick, forming the floor of limestone\r\nquarries in Wisconsin, have been known to buckle and arch and\r\nbreak to fragments under the heat of the summer sun.\r\n\r\nFROST. By this term is meant the freezing and thawing of water\r\ncontained in the pores and crevices of rocks. All rocks are more\r\nor less porous and all contain more or less water in their pores.\r\nWorkers in stone call this \"quarry water,\" and speak of a stone as\r\n\"green\" before the quarry water has dried out. Water also seeps\r\nalong joints and bedding planes and gathers in all seams and\r\ncrevices. Water expands in freezing, ten cubic inches of water\r\nfreezing to about eleven cubic inches of ice. As water freezes in\r\nthe rifts and pores of rocks it expands with the irresistible\r\nforce illustrated in the freezing and breaking of water pipes in\r\nwinter. The first rift in the rock, perhaps too narrow to be seen,\r\nis widened little by little by the wedges of successive frosts,\r\nand finally the rock is broken into detached blocks, and these\r\ninto angular chip-stone by the same process.\r\n\r\nIt is on mountain tops and in high latitudes that the effects of\r\nfrost are most plainly seen. \"Every summit\" says Whymper, \"amongst\r\nthe rock summits upon which I have stood has been nothing but a\r\npiled-up heap of fragments\" (Fig. 7). In Iceland, in Spitsbergen,\r\nin Kamchatka, and in other frigid lands large areas are thickly\r\nstrewn with sharp-edged fragments into which the rock has been\r\nshattered by frost.\r\n\r\nORGANIC AGENTS\r\n\r\nWe must reckon the roots of plants and trees among the agents\r\nwhich break rocks into pieces. The tiny rootlet in its search for\r\nfood and moisture inserts itself into some minute rift, and as it\r\ngrows slowly wedges the rock apart. Moreover, the acids of the\r\nroot corrode the rocks with which they are in contact. One may\r\nsometimes find in the soil a block of limestone wrapped in a mesh\r\nof roots, each of which lies in a little furrow where it has eaten\r\ninto the stone.\r\n\r\nRootless plants called lichens often cover and corrode rocks as\r\nyet bare of soil; but where lichens are destroying the rock less\r\nrapidly than does the weather, they serve in a way as a\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS FAVORING DISINTEGRATION AND DECAY. The\r\ndisintegration of rocks under frost and temperature changes\r\ngoes on most rapidly in cold and arid climates, and where\r\nvegetation is scant or absent. On the contrary, the decay of rocks\r\nunder the chemical action of water is favored by a warm, moist\r\nclimate and abundant vegetation. Frost and heat and cold can only\r\nact within the few feet from the surface to which the necessary\r\ntemperature changes are limited, while water penetrates and alters\r\nthe rocks to great depths.\r\n\r\nThe pupil may explain.\r\n\r\nIn what ways the presence of joints and bedding planes assists in\r\nthe breaking up and decay of rocks under the action of the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nWhy it is a good rule of stone masons never to lay stones on edge,\r\nbut always on their natural bedding planes.\r\n\r\nWhy stones fresh from the quarry sometimes go to pieces in early\r\nwinter, when stones which have been quarried for some months\r\nremain uninjured.\r\n\r\nWhy quarrymen in the northern states often keep their quarry\r\nfloors flooded during winter.\r\n\r\nWhy laminated limestone should not be used for curbstone.\r\n\r\nWhy rocks composed of layers differing in fineness of grain and in\r\nratios of expansion do not make good building stone.\r\n\r\nFine-grained rocks with pores so small that capillary attraction\r\nkeeps the water which they contain from readily draining away are\r\nmore apt to hold their pores ten elevenths full of water than are\r\nrocks whose pores are larger. Which, therefore, are more likely to\r\nbe injured by frost?\r\n\r\nWhich is subject to greater temperature changes, a dark rock or\r\none of a light color? the north side or the south side of a\r\nvalley?\r\n\r\nTHE MANTLE OF ROCK WASTE\r\n\r\nWe have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away. They\r\nare broken in pieces by frost, by tree roots, and by heat and\r\ncold. They dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of\r\nwater and the various corrosive substances which it contains,\r\nleaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon\r\nthe surface. As a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of\r\nrock waste which covers the land. It is well to imagine how the\r\ncountry would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation\r\nall scraped away or had it never been formed. The surface of the\r\nland would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nTHE THICKNESS OF THE MANTLE. In any locality the thickness of the\r\nmantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is\r\nconstantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming. On\r\nthe face of cliffs it is absent, for here waste is removed as fast\r\nas it is made. Where waste is carried away more slowly than it is\r\nproduced, it accumulates in time to great depth.\r\n\r\nThe granite of Pikes Peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty\r\nfeet. In the city of Washington granite rock is so softened to a\r\ndepth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel.\r\nAbout Atlanta, Georgia, the rocks are completely rotted for one\r\nhundred feet from the surface, while the beginnings of decay may\r\nbe noticed at thrice that depth. In places in southern Brazil the\r\nrock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet.\r\n\r\nIn southwestern Wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average\r\ndepth of thirteen feet on broad uplands, where it has been removed\r\nto the least extent. The country rock on which it rests is a\r\nlimestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities. At\r\nleast how thick, then, was that portion of the limestone which has\r\nrotted down to the clay?\r\n\r\nDISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS OF RESIDUAL WASTE. We must learn to\r\ndistinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather\r\nfrom the products of other geological agencies. Residual waste is\r\nunstratified. It contains no substances which have not been\r\nderived from the weathering of the parent rock. There is a gradual\r\ntransition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath.\r\nWaste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not\r\nformed in place.\r\n\r\nIn certain regions of southern Missouri the land is covered with a\r\nlayer of broken flints and red clay, while the country rock is\r\nlimestone. The limestone contains nodules of flint, and we may\r\ninfer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of\r\nlimestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left\r\nupon the surface. Flint is a form of quartz, dull-lustered,\r\nusually gray or blackish in color, and opaque except on thinnest\r\nedges, where it is translucent.\r\n\r\nOver much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified\r\nstony clay called the drift. It often rests on sound rocks. It\r\ncontains grains of sand, pebbles, and bowlders composed of many\r\ndifferent minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish.\r\nHence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock\r\nof the region. A shale or limestone, for example, cannot waste to\r\na clay containing granite pebbles. The origin of the drift will be\r\nexplained in subsequent chapters.\r\n\r\nThe differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to\r\ntheir insoluble constituents. The latter are few in number and are\r\nmuch the same in rocks of widely different nature, being chiefly\r\nquartz, silicate of alumina, and iron oxide. By the removal of\r\ntheir soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down\r\nto a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red\r\nor yellow with iron oxide.\r\n\r\nIn a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are\r\nan adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at\r\nthe earth's surface,--an environment different from that in which\r\nthey were formed under sea or under ground. In open air, where\r\nthey are attacked by various destructive agents, few of the rock-\r\nmaking minerals are stable compounds except quartz, the iron\r\noxides, and the silicate of alumina; and so it is to one or more\r\nof these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are\r\nreduced by long decay.\r\n\r\nWhich produces a mantle of finer waste, frost or chemical decay?\r\nwhich a thicker mantle? In what respects would you expect that the\r\nmantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like India, in\r\nfrozen countries like Alaska, and in deserts such as the Sahara?\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL. The same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are\r\ncontinually at work upon it, breaking it up into finer and finer\r\nparticles and causing its more complete decay. Thus on the\r\nsurface, where the waste has weathered longest, it is gradually\r\nmade fine enough to support the growth of plants, and is then\r\nknown as soil. The coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as\r\nsubsoil. Soil usually contains more or less dark, carbonaceous,\r\ndecaying organic matter, called humus, and is then often termed\r\nthe humus layer. Soil forms not only on waste produced in place\r\nfrom the rock beneath, but also on materials which have been\r\ntransported, such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits.\r\nUntil rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather\r\nis more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of\r\nwaste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed. Why?\r\n\r\nAny fresh excavation of cellar or cistern, or cut for road or\r\nrailway, will show the characteristics of the humus layer. It may\r\nform only a gray film on the surface, or we may find it a layer a\r\nfoot or more thick, dark, or even black, above, and growing\r\ngradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations\r\ninto the subsoil. In some way the decaying vegetable matter\r\ncontinually forming on the surface has become mingled with the\r\nmaterial beneath it.\r\n\r\nHOW HUMUS AND THE SUBSOIL ARE MINGLED. The mingling of humus and\r\nthe subsoil is brought about by several means. The roots of plants\r\npenetrate the waste, and when they die leave their decaying\r\nsubstance to fertilize it. Leaves and stems falling on the surface\r\nare turned under by several agents. Earthworms and other animals\r\nwhose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for\r\nfood or to line their nests. Trees overthrown by the wind, roots\r\nand all, turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together.\r\nBacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment.\r\nThe animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the\r\nmaking of soil. They bring the coarser fragments from beneath to\r\nthe surface, where the waste weathers more rapidly. Their burrows\r\nallow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to\r\naffect it to greater depths.\r\n\r\nANTS. In the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by\r\nants. They excavate underground galleries and chambers, extending\r\nsometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface, and build\r\nmounds which may reach as high above it. In some parts of Paraguay\r\nand southern Brazil these mounds, like gigantic potato hills,\r\ncover tracts of considerable area.\r\n\r\nIn search for its food--the dead wood of trees--the so-called\r\nwhite ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes,\r\nreaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches. On the\r\nplateaus of central Africa explorers have walked for miles through\r\nforests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of\r\nmud. Each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened\r\nand cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant, and is\r\nthus acted on by organic chemical agents. Sooner or later these\r\ngalleries are beaten down by heavy rains, and their fertilizing\r\nsubstances are scattered widely by the winds.\r\n\r\nEARTHWORMS. In temperate regions the waste is worked over largely\r\nby earthworms. In making their burrows worms swallow earth in\r\norder to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may\r\ncontain. They treat it with their digestive acids, grind it in\r\ntheir stony gizzards, and void it in castings on the surface of\r\nthe ground. It was estimated by Darwin that in many parts of\r\nEngland each year, on every acre, more than ten tons of earth pass\r\nthrough the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface,\r\nand that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over\r\nby them.\r\n\r\nIn all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched.\r\nGrain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is\r\nbrought to the surface, and the rich organic matter which plants\r\nand animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under. Thus\r\nNature plows and harrows on \"the great world's farm\" to make ready\r\nand ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nThe world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away\r\nare thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals. The\r\norganic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic, and because\r\nthe solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to\r\nlive upon the earth.\r\n\r\nSOLAR ENERGY. The source of the energy which accomplishes all this\r\nnecessary work is the sun. It is the radiant energy of the sun\r\nwhich causes the disintegration of rocks, which lifts vapor into\r\nthe atmosphere to fall as rain, which gives life to plants and\r\nanimals. Considering the earth in a broad way, we may view it as a\r\nglobe of solid rock,--the lithosphere,--surrounded by two mobile\r\nenvelopes: the envelope of air,--THE ATMOSPHERE, and the envelope\r\nof water,--THE HYDROSPHERE. Under the action of solar energy these\r\nenvelopes are in constant motion. Water from the hydrosphere is\r\ncontinually rising in vapor into the atmosphere, the air of the\r\natmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere,--for its gases are\r\ndissolved in all waters,--and both air and water enter and work\r\nupon the solid earth. By their action upon the lithosphere they\r\nhave produced a third envelope,--the mantle of rock waste.\r\n\r\nThis envelope also is in movement, not indeed as a whole, but\r\nparticle by particle. The causes which set its particles in\r\nmotion, and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume,\r\nwe will now proceed to study.\r\n\r\nMOVEMENTS OF THE MANTLE OF ROCK WASTE\r\n\r\nAt the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only\r\nthat the rocks were crumbling away, but also that grains and\r\nfragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to\r\nthe stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea. This\r\nprocess is going on everywhere. Slowly it may be, and with many\r\ninterruptions, but surely, the waste of the land moves downward to\r\nthe sea. We may divide its course into two parts,--the path to the\r\nstream, which we will now consider, and its carriage onward by the\r\nstream, which we will defer to a later chapter.\r\n\r\nGRAVITY. The chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is\r\ngravity. Each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull\r\nof the earth's mass and follows it when free to do so. All\r\nagencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in\r\nmotion, and therefore cooperate with gravity. On cliffs, rocks\r\nfall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees, and when\r\ndetached by any other agency. On slopes of waste, water freezes in\r\nchinks between stones, and in pores between particles of soil, and\r\nwedges them apart. Animals and plants stir the waste, heat expands\r\nit, cold contracts it, the strokes of the raindrops drive loose\r\nparticles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall. Of\r\nall these movements, gravity assists those which are downhill and\r\nretards those which are uphill. On the whole, therefore, the\r\ndownhill movements prevail, and the mantle of waste, block by\r\nblock and grain by grain, creeps along the downhill path.\r\n\r\nA slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle\r\nof 17 degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the\r\nslope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month.\r\nExplain why it did so.\r\n\r\nRAIN. The most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the\r\nstreams is the rain. It moves particles of soil by the force of\r\nthe blows of the falling drops, and washes them down all slopes to\r\nwithin reach of permanent streams. On surfaces unprotected by\r\nvegetation, as on plowed fields and in arid regions, the rain\r\nwears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in\r\nexposures of unaltered rock (Fig. 17).\r\n\r\nAt the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by\r\ncreep and wash to the depth of several feet; while where the\r\nhillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin, or quite\r\nabsent, because removed about as fast as formed. Against the walls\r\nof an abbey built on a slope in Wales seven hundred years ago, the\r\ncreeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven\r\nfeet. The slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences\r\nand walls, whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to\r\nshow a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side,\r\nespecially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nTALUS. At the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope\r\nof rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above. Such a\r\nheap of waste is known as talus. The amount of talus in any place\r\ndepends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its\r\nremoval. Talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical\r\ndisintegration is most effective, where rocks are readily broken\r\ninto blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than\r\nmassive, and where they are firm enough to be detached in\r\nfragments of some size instead of in fine grains. Talus is removed\r\nslowly where it decays slowly, either because of the climate or\r\nthe resistance of the rock. It may be rapidly removed by a stream\r\nflowing along its base.\r\n\r\nIn a moist climate a soluble rock, such as massive limestone, may\r\nform talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away. A\r\nloose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains,\r\nwhich in dry climates, where unprotected by vegetation, may be\r\nblown away as fast as they fall, leaving the cliff bare to the\r\nbase. Cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite\r\nwhen closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts.\r\n\r\nTalus slopes may be so steep as to reach THE ANGLE OF REPOSE, i.e.\r\nthe steepest angle at which the material will lie. This angle\r\nvaries with different materials, being greater with coarse and\r\nangular fragments than with fine rounded grains. Sooner or later a\r\ntalus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its\r\nsurface just equals that supplied from the cliff above. As the\r\ntalus is removed and weathers away its slope retreats together\r\nwith the retreat of the cliff, as seen in Figure 9.\r\n\r\nGRADED SLOPES. Where rocks weather faster than their waste is\r\ncarried away, the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges.\r\nOn the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement\r\nthan on slopes more gentle, but mountain sides and hills and\r\nplains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which\r\neverywhere is creeping toward the streams. Such unbroken slopes,\r\nworn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied\r\nby weathering can be urged onward, are known as GRADED SLOPES.\r\n\r\nOf far less importance than the silent, gradual creep of waste,\r\nwhich is going on at all times everywhere about us, are the\r\nstartling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\nAVALANCHES. On steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of\r\nwinter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below.\r\nThese rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste\r\nand are one of Nature's normal methods of moving it along the\r\ndownhill path.\r\n\r\nLANDSLIDES. Another common and abrupt method of delivering waste\r\nto streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses. After\r\nlong rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste\r\nand the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water\r\nunderground. The waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated\r\nand plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of\r\nmud and stones.\r\n\r\nWe may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide, where\r\nmasses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved\r\nin the sudden movement. Such slips occur when valleys have been\r\nrapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not\r\nyet been graded. A favorable condition is where the strata dip\r\n(i.e. incline downwards) towards the valley (Fig. 11), or are\r\nbroken by joint planes dipping in the same direction. The upper\r\nlayers, including perhaps the entire mountain side, have been cut\r\nacross by the valley trench and are left supported only on the\r\ninclined surface of the underlying rocks. Water may percolate\r\nunderground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the\r\nupper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of\r\na shale to soft wet clay, by dissolving layers of a limestone, or\r\nby removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose\r\nsand. When the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying\r\nmasses may be launched into the valley below. The solid rocks are\r\nbroken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting,\r\nlike that of talus, of angular unsorted fragments, blocks of all\r\nsizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust. The\r\nprincipal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nAt Gohna, India, in 1893, the face of a spur four thousand feet\r\nhigh, of the lower ranges of the Himalayas, slipped into the gorge\r\nof the headwaters of the Ganges River in successive rock falls\r\nwhich lasted for three days. Blocks of stone were projected for a\r\nmile, and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the\r\nsurrounding country. The debris formed a dam one thousand feet\r\nhigh, extending for two miles along the valley. A lake gathered\r\nbehind this barrier, gradually rising until it overtopped it in a\r\nlittle less than a year. The upper portion of the dam then broke,\r\nand a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave\r\nwhich, twenty miles away, rose one hundred and sixty feet in\r\nheight. A narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam.\r\n\r\nIn 1896, after forty days of incessant rain, a cliff of sandstone\r\nslipped into the Yangtse River in China, reducing the width of the\r\nchannel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids.\r\n\r\nAt Flims, in Switzerland, a prehistoric landslip flung a dam\r\neighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the Rhine. If\r\nspread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles, the\r\nmaterial would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet.\r\nThe barrier is not yet entirely cut away, and several lakes are\r\nheld in shallow basins on its hummocky surface.\r\n\r\nA slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of\r\nQuebec, in 1889, dashed across Champlain Street, wrecking a number\r\nof houses and causing the death of forty-five persons. The strata\r\nhere are composed of steeply dipping slate.\r\n\r\nIn lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without\r\nits traces of landslides, so common there is this method of the\r\nmovement of waste, and of building to grade over-steepened slopes.\r\n\r\nROCK SCULPTURE BY WEATHERING\r\n\r\nWe are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses\r\nare carved by the weather.\r\n\r\nBOWLDERS OF WEATHERING. In many quarries and outcrops we may see\r\nthat the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers\r\nhave been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no\r\nlonger angular, as are those of the layers below. The edges and\r\ncorners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather. Such\r\nrounded cores, known as bowlders of weathering, are often left to\r\nstrew the surface.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENTIAL WEATHERING. This term covers all cases in which a\r\nrock mass weathers differently in different portions. Any weaker\r\nspots or layers are etched out on the surface, leaving the more\r\nresistant in relief. Thus massive limestones become pitted where\r\nthe weather drills out the weaker portions. In these pits, when\r\nonce they are formed, moisture gathers, a little soil collects,\r\nvegetation takes root, and thus they are further enlarged until\r\nthe limestone may be deeply honeycombed.\r\n\r\nOn the sides of canyons, and elsewhere where the edges of strata\r\nare exposed, the harder layers project as cliffs, while the softer\r\nweather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers\r\nabove them. It is convenient to call the former cliff makers and\r\nthe latter slope makers.\r\n\r\nDifferential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the\r\nland. Areas of weak rock are wasted to plains, while areas of hard\r\nrock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges, as in\r\nthe valleys and mountains of eastern Pennsylvania. But in such\r\ninstances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also\r\ndue to the wear of streams, and especially to the removal by them\r\nfrom the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nRocks owe their weakness to several different causes. Some, such\r\nas beds of loose sand, are soft and easily worn by rains; some, as\r\nlimestone and gypsum for example, are soluble. Even hard insoluble\r\nrocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are\r\nclosely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily\r\nbroken up into blocks by mechanical agencies.\r\n\r\nOUTLIERS AND MONUMENTS. As cliffs retreat under the attack of the\r\nweather, portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant\r\nor where the attack for any reason is less severe. Such remnant\r\nmasses, if large, are known as outliers. When\r\n\r\nNote the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments.\r\nIn the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees,\r\ncomposed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather. On the\r\nremoval of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded\r\nthey are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the\r\nresidual flints of southern Missouri. flat-topped, because of the\r\nprotection of a resistant horizontal capping layer, they are\r\ntermed mesas,--a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of\r\ndissected plateaus (Fig. 129). Retreating cliffs may fall back a\r\nnumber of miles behind their outliers before the latter are\r\nfinally consumed.\r\n\r\nMonuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached\r\nfrom the cliff face. In the breaking down of sheets of horizontal\r\nstrata, outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to\r\nmassive rectangular monuments resembling castles (Fig. 17). The\r\nrock castle falls into ruin, leaving here and there an isolated\r\ntower; the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar, soon to be\r\noverthrown. The various and often picturesque shapes of monuments\r\ndepend on the kind of rock, the attitude of the strata, and the\r\nagent by which they are chiefly carved. Thus pillars may have a\r\ncapital formed of a resistant stratum. Monuments may be undercut\r\nand come to rest on narrow pedestals, wherever they weather more\r\nrapidly near the ground, either because of the greater moisture\r\nthere, or--in arid climates--because worn at their base by\r\ndrifting sands.\r\n\r\nStony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders\r\nwhich protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows\r\nof raindrops, and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height.\r\nOne may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles\r\nleft in the same way, protecting tiny pedestals of sand.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN PEAKS AND RIDGES. Most mountains have been carved out of\r\ngreat broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earth's crust.\r\nRunning water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into\r\nmasses divided by deep valleys; but it is by the weather, for the\r\nmost part, that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to\r\nthe present forms of the individual peaks and ridges.\r\n\r\nFrost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp,\r\ntusklike peaks and ragged, serrate crests, where their waste is\r\nreadily removed.\r\n\r\nThe Matterhorn of the Alps is a famous example of a mountain peak\r\nwhose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress.\r\nOn its face \"scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached,\" and the\r\nfall of loosened stones is incessant. Mountain climbers who have\r\ncamped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come\r\nleaping down its precipices, followed by trains of dislodged\r\nsmaller fragments and rock dust; and how at night one may trace\r\nthe course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from\r\nthe mountain walls. Mount Assiniboine, Canada (Fig. 20), resembles\r\nthe Matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies.\r\n\r\n\"The Needles\" of Arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a\r\nwarm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes.\r\n\r\nChemical decay, especially when carried on beneath a cover of\r\nwaste and vegetation, favors the production of rounded knobs and\r\ndome-shaped mountains.\r\n\r\nTHE WEATHER CURVE. We have seen that weathering reduces the\r\nangular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by\r\nchipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges. In much the\r\nsame way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth\r\nblocks cut by streams or formed in any other way. High mountains\r\nmay at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks (Fig.\r\n181), but toward the end of their life history they wear down to\r\nrounded hills (Fig. 182). The weather curve, which may be seen on\r\nthe summits of low hills (Fig. 21), is convex upward.\r\n\r\nIn Figure 22, representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are\r\na yard square, how many square feet of surface are exposed to the\r\nweather by a cubic foot at a corner a; by one situated in the\r\nmiddle of an edge b; by one in the center of a side c? How much\r\nfaster will a and b weather than c, and what will be the effect on\r\nthe shape of the block?\r\n\r\nTHE COOPERATION OF VARIOUS AGENCIES IN ROCK SCULPTURE. For the\r\nsake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each\r\ngeological agent separately. We must not forget, however, that in\r\nNature no agent works independently and alone; that every result\r\nis the outcome of a long chain of causes. Thus, in order that the\r\nmountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration, the\r\nwaste must be rapidly removed,--a work done by many agents,\r\nincluding some which we are yet to study; and in order that the\r\nwaste may be removed as fast as formed, the region must first have\r\nbeen raised well above the level of the sea, so that the agents of\r\ntransportation could do their work effectively. The sculpture of\r\nthe rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces.\r\n\r\nThe constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash\r\nand carriage by streams is of the highest importance, because it\r\nallows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on\r\nas long as any land remains above sea level. If waste were not\r\nremoved, it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock\r\nbeneath from further weathering, and the processes of destruction\r\nwhich we have studied would be brought to an end. The very\r\npresence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the\r\nwhole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed. The\r\ndestruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be\r\ncarried away.\r\n\r\nWe have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of\r\nthe destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks\r\nof the land surface. Similar records we shall find buried deeply\r\namong the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and\r\ndecayed, telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather.\r\nEver since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now\r\nquietly and unceasingly at work upon it, and have ever been the\r\nchief means of the destruction of its rocks. The vast bulk of the\r\nstratified rocks of the earth's crust is made up almost wholly of\r\nthe waste thus worn from ancient lands.\r\n\r\nIn studying the various geological agencies we must remember the\r\nalmost inconceivable times in which they work. The slowest process\r\nwhen multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on\r\nproduces great results. The geologist looks upon the land forms of\r\nthe earth's surface as monuments which record the slow action of\r\nweathering and other agents during the ages of the past. The\r\nmountain peak, the rounded hill, the wide plain which lies where\r\nhills and mountains once stood, tell clearly of the great results\r\nwhich slow processes will reach when given long time in which to\r\ndo their work. We should accustom ourselves also to think of the\r\nresults which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass. The\r\ntombstone and the bowlder of the field, which each year lose from\r\ntheir surfaces a few crystalline grains, must in time be wholly\r\ndestroyed. The hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a\r\ncover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and\r\nmillenniums come and go, and will finally disappear. Even the\r\nmountains are crumbling away continually, and therefore are but\r\nfleeting features of the landscape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF GROUND WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nLAND WATERS. We have seen how large is the part that water plays\r\nat and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering\r\nand in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream\r\nways. We now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the\r\nground,--a corrosive agent still, and carrying in solution as its\r\nload the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nLand waters have their immediate source in the rainfall. By the\r\nheat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the\r\nocean and from moist surfaces everywhere. Mingled as vapor with\r\nthe air, it is carried by the winds over sea and land, and\r\ncondensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow. That part of\r\nthe rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us, but\r\nthat which falls on the land accomplishes, as it returns to the\r\nsea, the most important work of all surface geological agencies.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall may be divided into three parts: the first DRIES UP,\r\nbeing discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from\r\nthe soil or through vegetation; the second RUNS OFF over the\r\nsurface to flood the streams; the third SOAKS IN the ground and is\r\nhenceforth known as GROUND or UNDERGROUND WATER.\r\n\r\nTHE DESCENT OF GROUND WATER. Seeping through the mantle of waste,\r\nground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying\r\nrock. All rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less\r\nporous, and all drink in water. IMPERVIOUS ROCKS, such as granite,\r\nclay, and shale, have pores so minute that the water which they\r\ntake in is held fast within them by capillary attraction, and none\r\ndrains through. PERVIOUS ROCKS, on the other hand, such as many\r\nsandstones, have pore spaces so large that water filters through\r\nthem more or less freely. Besides its seepage through the pores of\r\npervious rocks, water passes to lower levels through the joints\r\nand cracks by which all rocks, near the surface are broken.\r\n\r\nEven the closest-grained granite has a pore space of 1 in 400,\r\nwhile sandstone may have a pore space of 1 in 4. Sand is so porous\r\nthat it may absorb a third of its volume of water, and a loose\r\nloam even as much as one half.\r\n\r\nTHE GROUND-WATER SURFACE is the name given the upper surface of\r\nground water, the level below which all rocks are saturated. In\r\ndry seasons the ground-water surface sinks. For ground water is\r\nconstantly seeping downward under gravity, it is evaporated in the\r\nwaste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the\r\nroots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air. In wet\r\nseasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh\r\nsupplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the\r\nground, and the ground-water surface rises.\r\n\r\nIn moist climates the ground-water surface (Fig. 24) lies, as a\r\nrule, within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in\r\na general way, although with slopes of less inclination than those\r\nof the hills and valleys. In dry climates permanent ground water\r\nmay be found only at depths of hundreds of feet. Ground water is\r\nheld at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly\r\nimpeded by capillarity and friction. If it were as free to drain\r\naway as are surface streams, it would sink soon after a rain to\r\nthe level of the deepest valleys of the region.\r\n\r\nWELLS AND SPRINGS. Excavations made in permeable rocks below the\r\nground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells.\r\nWhere valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed, the\r\nwater either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at\r\ndefinite points called springs, where it is concentrated by the\r\nstructure of the rocks. A level tract where the ground-water\r\nsurface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or\r\nmarsh.\r\n\r\nBy studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of\r\nground water. Spring water differs from that of the stream into\r\nwhich it flows in several respects. If we test the spring with a\r\nthermometer during successive months, we shall find that its\r\ntemperature remains much the same the year round. In summer it is\r\nmarkedly cooler than the stream; in winter it is warmer and\r\nremains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice. This\r\nmeans that its underground path must lie at such a distance from\r\nthe surface that it is little affected by summer's heat and\r\nwinter's cold.\r\n\r\nWhile the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it\r\nby rains, the spring remains clear; its water has been filtered\r\nduring its slow movement through many small underground passages\r\nand the pores of rocks. Commonly the spring differs from the\r\nstream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock.\r\nChemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in\r\nsolution, but these are usually in quantities so small that they\r\nare not perceptible to the taste or feel. But the water of springs\r\nis often well charged with soluble minerals; in its slow, long\r\njourney underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the\r\nrocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as\r\nit could. When spring water is boiled away, the invisible load\r\nwhich it has carried is left behind, and in composition is found\r\nto be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients\r\nof the country rock. Although to some extent the soluble waste of\r\nrocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain, by far the larger\r\npart is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to\r\nstreams by springs.\r\n\r\nIn limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate\r\n(the carbonate of lime), and where the limestone is magnesian they\r\ncontain magnesium carbonate also. Such waters are \"hard\"; when\r\nused in washing, the minerals which they contain combine with the\r\nfatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds. When\r\nsprings rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with\r\ncalcium sulphate. In granite regions they contain more or less\r\nsoda and potash from the decay of feldspar.\r\n\r\nThe flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons\r\nof the year than does that of surface streams. So slow is the\r\nmovement of ground water through the rocks that even during long\r\ndroughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface\r\ndrainage.\r\n\r\nMOVEMENTS OF GROUND WATER. Ground water is in constant movement\r\ntoward its outlets. Its rate varies according to many conditions,\r\nbut always is extremely slow. Even through loose sands beneath the\r\nbeds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nIn any region two zones of flow may be distinguished. The UPPER\r\nZONE OF FLOW extends from the ground-water surface downward\r\nthrough the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the\r\nmantle rests, as far as the first impermeable layer, where the\r\ndescending movement of the water is stopped. The DEEP ZONES OF\r\nFLOW occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the\r\nimpervious layer which lies nearest to the surface. The upper zone\r\nis a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly\r\nseeping downward through their pores and interstices along the\r\nslopes to the valleys, where in part it discharges in springs and\r\noften unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and\r\nfeeds the river (Fig. 24).\r\n\r\nA city in a region of copious rains, built on the narrow flood\r\nplain of a river, overlooked by hills, depends for its water\r\nsupply on driven wells, within the city limits, sunk in the sand a\r\nfew yards from the edge of the stream. Are these wells fed by\r\nwater from the river percolating through the sand, or by ground\r\nwater on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the\r\nsewage of the town?\r\n\r\nAt what height does underground water stand in the wells of your\r\nregion? Does it vary with the season? Have you ever known wells to\r\ngo dry? It may be possible to get data from different wells and to\r\ndraw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with\r\nthe surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nFISSURE SPRINGS AND ARTESIAN WELLS. The DEEPER ZONES OF FLOW lie in\r\npervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum.\r\nSuch layers are often carried by their dip to great depths, and\r\nwater may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface\r\nstreams and even of the sea. When a fissure crosses a water-\r\nbearing stratum, or AQUIFIER, water is forced upward by the\r\npressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts\r\nof the stratum, and may reach the surface as a fissure spring. A\r\nboring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well, a\r\nname derived from a province in France where wells of this kind\r\nhave been long in use. The rise of the water in artesian wells,\r\nand in fissure springs also, depends on the following conditions\r\nillustrated in Figure 29. The aquifer dips toward the region of\r\nthe wells from higher ground, where it outcrops and receives its\r\nwater. It is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water-\r\ntight or water-logged layers beneath. The weight of the column of\r\nwater thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the\r\nwell, precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces\r\nit in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings.\r\n\r\nWhich will supply the larger region with artesian wells, an\r\naquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle? Which of\r\nthe two aquifers, their thickness being equal, will have the\r\nlarger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger\r\namount of water from the rainfall? Illustrate with diagrams.\r\n\r\nTHE ZONE OF SOLUTION. Near the surface, where the circulation of\r\nground water is most active, it oxidizes, corrodes, and dissolves\r\nthe rocks through which it passes. It leaches soils and subsoils\r\nof their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend\r\nfor their food. It takes away the soluble cements of rocks; it\r\nwidens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the\r\nbedding planes; it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks,\r\nsuch as rock salt, limestone, or gypsum. The work of ground water\r\nin producing landslides has already been noticed. The zone in\r\nwhich the work of ground water is thus for the most part\r\ndestructive we may call the zone of solution.\r\n\r\nCAVES. In massive limestone rocks, ground water dissolves channels\r\nwhich sometimes form large caves (Fig. 30). The necessary\r\nconditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well\r\nshown in central Kentucky, where an upland is built throughout of\r\nthick horizontal beds of limestone. The absence of layers of\r\ninsoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free\r\ncirculation of ground water within it by the way of all natural\r\nopenings in the rock. These water ways have been gradually\r\nenlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with\r\ncaves. Five hundred open caverns are known in one county.\r\n\r\nMammoth Cave, the largest of these caverns, consists of a\r\nlabyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is\r\nsaid to be as much as thirty miles. One passage four miles long\r\nhas an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of\r\nforty feet. One of the great halls is three hundred feet in width\r\nand is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet\r\nabove the floor. Galleries at different levels are connected by\r\nwell-like pits, some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five\r\nfeet from top to bottom. Through some of the lowest of these\r\ntunnels flows Echo River, still at work dissolving and wearing\r\naway the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a\r\ngreat spring.\r\n\r\nNATURAL BRIDGES. As a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land\r\nabove it is lowered by weathering, the roof at last breaks down\r\nand the cave becomes an open ravine. A portion of the roof may for\r\na while remain, forming a \"natural bridge.\"\r\n\r\nSINK HOLES. In limestone regions channels under ground may become\r\nso well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away\r\nthrough them. Ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep\r\nto find it. Little or no surface water is left to form brooks.\r\n\r\nThus across the limestone upland of central Kentucky one meets but\r\nthree surface streams in a hundred miles. Between their valleys\r\nsurface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes.\r\nThese are pits, commonly funnel shaped, formed by the enlargement\r\nof crevice or joint by percolating water, or by the breakdown of\r\nsome portion of the roof of a cave. By clogging of the outlet a\r\nsink hole may come to be filled by a pond.\r\n\r\nCentral Florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely\r\nsubterranean and in part below the level even of the sea. Sink\r\nholes are common, and many of them are occupied by lakelets. Great\r\nsprings mark the point of issue of underground streams, while some\r\nrise from beneath the sea. Silver Spring, one of the largest,\r\ndischarges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet\r\ndeep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source.\r\nAbout the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles.\r\n\r\nTHE KARST. Along the eastern coast of the Adriatic, as far south\r\nas Montenegro, lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn\r\nand honeycombed by the solvent action of water. Where forests have\r\nbeen cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away,\r\nthe surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock\r\nwhere each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch\r\nwork of shallow furrows and sharp ridges. Great sink holes, some\r\nof them six hundred feet deep and more, pockmark the surface of\r\nthe land. The drainage is chiefly subterranean. Surface streams\r\nare rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground.\r\nFragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where\r\nthe rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to\r\nreappear some miles away. Ground water stands so far below the\r\nsurface that it cannot be reached by wells, and the inhabitants\r\ndepend on rain water stored for household uses. The finest cavern\r\nof Europe, the Adelsberg Grotto, is in this region. Karst, the\r\nname of a part of this country, is now used to designate any\r\nregion or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of\r\nsurface and ground water. We must remember that Karst regions are\r\nrare, and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams,\r\nit is far less important than the work done by the sheets of\r\nunderground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous\r\nrocks in other regions.\r\n\r\nEven when gathered into definite channels, ground water does not\r\nhave the erosive power of surface streams, since it carries with\r\nit little or no rock waste. Regions whose underground drainage is\r\nso perfect that the development of surface streams has been\r\nretarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action\r\nof surface running waters, and may therefore stand higher than the\r\nsurrounding country. The hill honeycombed by Luray Cavern,\r\nVirginia, has been attributed to this cause.\r\n\r\nCAVERN DEPOSITS. Even in the zone of solution water may under\r\ncertain circumstances deposit as well as erode. As it trickles\r\nfrom the roof of caverns, the lime carbonate which it has taken\r\ninto solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by\r\nevaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called STALACTITES.\r\nAs the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same\r\nway thicker masses called STALAGMITES, which may grow to join the\r\nstalactites above, forming pillars. A stalagmitic crust often\r\nseals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns, together\r\nwith whatever relics of cave dwellers, either animals or men, it\r\nmay contain.\r\n\r\nCan you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of\r\nsingle drops are often hollow pipes?\r\n\r\nTHE ZONE OF CEMENTATION. With increasing depth subterranean water\r\nbecomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more\r\nhighly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above. At\r\nsuch depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks,\r\ncementing their grains together, and in crevices and fissures,\r\nforming mineral veins. Thus below the zone of solution where the\r\nwork of water is to dissolve, lies the zone of cementation where\r\nits work is chemical deposit. A part of the invisible load of\r\nwaste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at\r\ngreater depths.\r\n\r\nAs the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the\r\nwork of rain and streams, rocks which have lain deep within the\r\nzone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution. Thus\r\nthere are exposed to view limestones, whose cracks were filled\r\nwith calcite (crystallized carbonate of lime), with quartz or\r\nother minerals, and sandstones whose grains were well cemented\r\nmany feet below the surface.\r\n\r\nCAVITY FILLING. Small cavities in the rocks are often found more\r\nor less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by\r\nwater in its constant circulation underground. The process may be\r\nillustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of\r\nevaporating brine, but in the latter instance the solution is not\r\nrenewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks. A cavity thus\r\nlined with inward-pointing crystals is called a GEODE.\r\n\r\nCONCRETIONS. Ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may\r\ngather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses\r\ncalled concretions. Thus silica disseminated through limestone is\r\ngathered into nodules of flint. While geodes grow from the outside\r\ninwards, concretions grow outwards from the center. Nor are they\r\nformed in already existing cavities as are geodes. In soft clays\r\nconcretions may, as they grow, press the clay aside. In many other\r\nrocks concretions are made by the process of REPLACEMENT. Molecule\r\nby molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion\r\nsubstituted in its place. The concretion may in this way preserve\r\nintact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock. Clays\r\nand shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate, of iron\r\ncarbonate, or of iron sulphide. Some fossil, such as a leaf or\r\nshell, frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion\r\ngrows.\r\n\r\nWhy are building stones more easily worked when \"green\" than after\r\ntheir quarry water has dried out?\r\n\r\nDEPOSITS OF GROUND WATER IN ARID REGIONS. In arid lands where\r\nground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there\r\nevaporates, it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held\r\nin solution. White limy incrustations of this nature cover\r\nconsiderable tracts in northern Mexico. Evaporating beneath the\r\nsurface, ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose\r\nsand and gravel. Such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in\r\nwestern Kansas and Nebraska, where they are known as \"mortar\r\nbeds.\"\r\n\r\nTHERMAL SPRINGS. While the lower limit of surface drainage is sea\r\nlevel, subterranean water circulates much below that depth, and is\r\nbrought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure. In many\r\ninstances springs have a higher temperature than the average\r\nannual temperature of the region, and are then known as thermal\r\nsprings. In regions of present or recent volcanic activity, such\r\nas the Yellowstone National Park, we may believe that the heat of\r\nthermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas, perhaps not far\r\nbelow the surface. But when hot springs occur at a distance of\r\nhundreds of miles from any volcano, as in the case of the hot\r\nsprings of Bath, England, it is probable that their waters have\r\nrisen from the heated rocks of the earth's interior. The springs\r\nof Bath have a temperature of 120 degrees F., 70 degrees above the\r\naverage annual temperature of the place. If we assume that the\r\nrate of increase in the earth's internal heat is here the average\r\nrate, 1 degree F. to every sixty feet of descent, we may conclude\r\nthat the springs of Bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two\r\nhundred feet.\r\n\r\nWater may descend to depths from which it can never be brought\r\nback by hydrostatic pressure. It is absorbed by highly heated\r\nrocks deep below the surface. From time to time some of this deep-\r\nseated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\nSURFACE DEPOSITS OF SPRINGS. Where subterranean water returns to\r\nthe surface highly charged with minerals in solution, on exposure\r\nto the air it is commonly compelled to lay down much of its\r\ninvisible load in chemical deposits about the spring. These are\r\nthrown down from solution either because of cooling, evaporation,\r\nthe loss of carbon dioxide, or the work of algae.\r\n\r\nMany springs have been charged under pressure with carbon dioxide\r\nfrom subterranean sources and are able therefore to take up large\r\nquantities of lime carbonate from the limestone rocks through\r\nwhich they pass. On reaching the surface the pressure is relieved,\r\nthe gas escapes, and the lime carbonate is thrown down in deposits\r\ncalled TRAVERTINE. The gas is sometimes withdrawn and the deposit\r\nproduced in large part by the action of algae and other humble\r\nforms of plant life.\r\n\r\nAt the Mammoth Hot Springs in the valley of the Gardiner River,\r\nYellowstone National Park, beautiful terraces and basins of\r\ntravertine are now building, chiefly by means of algae which cover\r\nthe bottoms, rims, and sides of the basins and deposit lime\r\ncarbonate upon them in successive sheets. The rock, snow-white\r\nwhere dry, is coated with red and orange gelatinous mats where the\r\nalgae thrive in the over-flowing waters.\r\n\r\nSimilar terraces of travertine are found to a height of fourteen\r\nhundred feet up the valley side. We may infer that the springs\r\nwhich formed these ancient deposits discharged near what was then\r\nthe bottom of the valley, and that as the valley has been deepened\r\nby the river the ground water of the region has found lower and\r\nlower points of issue.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the country calcareous springs occur which coat\r\nwith lime carbonate mosses, twigs, and other objects over which\r\ntheir waters flow. Such are popularly known as petrifying springs,\r\nalthough they merely incrust the objects and do not convert them\r\ninto stone.\r\n\r\nSilica is soluble in alkaline waters, especially when these are\r\nhot. Hot springs rising through alkaline siliceous rocks, such as\r\nlavas, often deposit silica in a white spongy formation known as\r\nSILICEOUS SINTER, both by evaporation and by the action of algae\r\nwhich secrete silica from the waters. It is in this way that the\r\ncones and mounds of the geysers in the Yellowstone National Park\r\nand in Iceland have been formed.\r\n\r\nWhere water oozes from the earth one may sometimes see a rusty\r\ndeposit on the ground, and perhaps an iridescent scum upon the\r\nwater. The scum is often mistaken for oil, but at a touch it\r\ncracks and breaks, as oil would not do. It is a film of hydrated\r\niron oxide, or LIMONITE, and the spring is an iron, or chalybeate,\r\nspring. Compounds of iron have been taken into solution by ground\r\nwater from soil and rocks, and are now changed to the insoluble\r\noxide on exposure to the oxygen of the air.\r\n\r\nIn wet ground iron compounds leached by ground water from the soil\r\noften collect in reddish deposits a few feet below the surface,\r\nwhere their downward progress is arrested by some impervious clay.\r\nAt the bottom of bogs and shallow lakes iron ores sometimes\r\naccumulate to a depth of several feet.\r\n\r\nDecaying organic matter plays a large part in these changes. In\r\nits presence the insoluble iron oxides which give color to most\r\nred and yellow rocks are decomposed, leaving the rocks of a gray\r\nor bluish color, and the soluble iron compounds which result are\r\nreadily leached out,--effects seen where red or yellow clays have\r\nbeen bleached about some decaying tree root.\r\n\r\nThe iron thus dissolved is laid down as limonite when oxidized, as\r\nabout a chalybeate spring; but out of contact with the air and in\r\nthe presence of carbon dioxide supplied by decaying vegetation, as\r\nin a peat bog, it may be deposited as iron carbonate, or SIDERITE.\r\n\r\nTOTAL AMOUNT OF UNDERGROUND WATERS. In order to realize the vast\r\nwork in solution and cementation which underground waters are now\r\ndoing and have done in all geological ages, we must gain some\r\nconception of their amount. At a certain depth, estimated at about\r\nsix miles, the weight of the crust becomes greater than the rocks\r\ncan bear, and all cavities and pores in them must be completely\r\nclosed by the enormous pressure which they sustain. Below a depth\r\nof even three or four miles it is believed that ground water\r\ncannot circulate. Estimating the average pore spaces of the\r\ndifferent rocks of the earth's crust above this depth, and the\r\naverage per cents of their pore spaces occupied by water, it has\r\nbeen recently computed that the total amount of ground water is\r\nequal to a sheet of water one hundred feet deep, covering the\r\nentire surface of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nRIVERS AND VALLEYS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUN-OFF. We have traced the history of that portion of the\r\nrainfall which soaks into the ground; let us now return to that\r\npart which washes along the surface and is known as the RUN-OFF.\r\nFed by rains and melting snows, the run-off gathers into courses,\r\nperhaps but faintly marked at first, which join more definite and\r\ndeeply cut channels, as twigs their stems. In a humid climate the\r\nlarger ravines through which the run-off flows soon descend below\r\nthe ground-water surface. Here springs discharge along the sides\r\nof the little valleys and permanent streams begin. The water\r\nsupplied by the run-off here joins that part of the rainfall which\r\nhad soaked into the soil, and both now proceed together by way of\r\nthe stream to the sea.\r\n\r\nRIVER FLOODS. Streams vary greatly in volume during the year. At\r\nstages of flood they fill their immediate banks, or overrun them\r\nand inundate any low lands adjacent to the channel; at stages of\r\nlow water they diminish to but a fraction of their volume when at\r\nflood.\r\n\r\nAt times of flood, rivers are fed chiefly by the run-off; at times\r\nof low water, largely or even wholly by springs.\r\n\r\nHow, then, will the water of streams differ at these times in\r\nturbidity and in the relative amount of solids carried in\r\nsolution?\r\n\r\nIn parts of England streams have been known to continue flowing\r\nafter eighteen months of local drought, so great is the volume of\r\nwater which in humid climates is stored in the rocks above the\r\ndrainage level, and so slowly is it given off in springs.\r\n\r\nIn Illinois and the states adjacent, rivers remain low in winter\r\nand a \"spring freshet\" follows the melting of the winter's snows.\r\nA \"June rise\" is produced by the heavy rains of early summer. Low\r\nwater follows in July and August, and streams are again swollen to\r\na moderate degree under the rains of autumn.\r\n\r\nTHE DISCHARGE OF STREAMS. The per cent of rainfall discharged by\r\nrivers varies with the amount of rainfall, the slope of the\r\ndrainage area, the texture of the rocks, and other factors. With\r\nan annual rainfall of fifty inches in an open country, about fifty\r\nper cent is discharged; while with a rainfall of twenty inches\r\nonly fifteen per cent is discharged, part of the remainder being\r\nevaporated and part passing underground beyond the drainage area.\r\nThus the Ohio discharges thirty per cent of the rainfall of its\r\nbasin, while the Missouri carries away but fifteen per cent. A\r\nnumber of the streams of the semi-arid lands of the West do not\r\ndischarge more than five per cent of the rainfall.\r\n\r\nOther things being equal, which will afford the larger proportion\r\nof run-off, a region underlain with granite rock or with coarse\r\nsandstone? grass land or forest? steep slopes or level land? a\r\nwell-drained region or one abounding in marshes and ponds? frozen\r\nor unfrozen ground? Will there be a larger proportion of run-off\r\nafter long rains or after a season of drought? after long and\r\ngentle rains, or after the same amount of precipitation in a\r\nviolent rain? during the months of growing vegetation, from June\r\nto August, or during the autumn months?\r\n\r\nDESERT STREAMS. In arid regions the ground-water surface lies so\r\nlow that for the most part stream ways do not intersect it.\r\nStreams therefore are not fed by springs, but instead lose volume\r\nas their waters soak into the thirsty rocks over which they flow.\r\nThey contribute to the ground water of the region instead of being\r\nincreased by it. Being supplied chiefly by the run-off, they\r\nwither at times of drought to a mere trickle of water, to a chain\r\nof pools, or go wholly dry, while at long intervals rains fill\r\ntheir dusty beds with sudden raging torrents. Desert rivers\r\ntherefore periodically shorten and lengthen their courses,\r\nwithering back at times of drought for scores of miles, or even\r\nfor a hundred miles from the point reached by their waters during\r\nseasons of rain.\r\n\r\nTHE GEOLOGICAL WORK OF STREAMS. The work of streams is of three\r\nkinds,--transportation, erosion, and deposition. Streams TRANSPORT\r\nthe waste of the land; they wear, or ERODE, their channels both on\r\nbed and banks; and they DEPOSIT portions of their load from time\r\nto time along their courses, finally laying it down in the sea.\r\nMost of the work of streams is done at times of flood.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION\r\n\r\nTHE INVISIBLE LOAD OF STREAMS. Of the waste which a river\r\ntransports we may consider first the invisible load which it\r\ncarries in solution, supplied chiefly by springs but also in part\r\nby the run-off and from the solution of the rocks of its bed. More\r\nthan half the dissolved solids in the water of the average river\r\nconsists of the carbonates of lime and magnesia; other substances\r\nare gypsum, sodium sulphate (Glauber's salts), magnesium sulphate\r\n(Epsom salts), sodium chloride (common salt), and even silica, the\r\nleast soluble of the common rock-making minerals. The amount of\r\nthis invisible load is surprisingly large. The Mississippi, for\r\nexample, transports each year 113,000,000 tons of dissolved rock\r\nto the Gulf.\r\n\r\nTHE VISIBLE LOAD OF STREAMS. This consists of the silt which the\r\nstream carries in suspension, and the sand and gravel and larger\r\nstones which it pushes along its bed. Especially in times of flood\r\none may note the muddy water, its silt being kept from settling by\r\nthe rolling, eddying currents; and often by placing his ear close\r\nto the bottom of a boat one may hear the clatter of pebbles as\r\nthey are hurried along. In mountain torrents the rumble of\r\nbowlders as they clash together may be heard some distance away.\r\nThe amount of the load which a stream can transport depends on its\r\nvelocity. A current of two thirds of a mile per hour can move fine\r\nsand, while one of four miles per hour sweeps along pebbles as\r\nlarge as hen's eggs. The transporting power of a stream varies as\r\nthe sixth power of its velocity. If its velocity is multiplied by\r\ntwo, its transporting power is multiplied by the sixth power of\r\ntwo: it can now move stones sixty-four times as large as it could\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nStones weigh from two to three times as much as water, and in\r\nwater lose the weight of the volume of water which they displace.\r\nWhat proportion, then, of their weight in air do stones lose when\r\nsubmerged?\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENT OF STREAM LOADS. To obtain the total amount of waste\r\ntransported by a river is an important but difficult matter. The\r\namount of water discharged must first be found by multiplying the\r\nnumber of square feet in the average cross section of the stream\r\nby its velocity per second, giving the discharge per second in\r\ncubic feet. The amount of silt to a cubic foot of water is found\r\nby filtering samples of the water taken from different parts of\r\nthe stream and at different times in the year, and drying and\r\nweighing the residues. The average amount of silt to the cubic\r\nfoot of water, multiplied by the number of cubic feet of water\r\ndischarged per year, gives the total load carried in suspension\r\nduring that time. Adding to this the estimated amount of sand and\r\ngravel rolled along the bed, which in many swift rivers greatly\r\nexceeds the lighter material held in suspension, and adding also\r\nthe total amount of dissolved solids, we reach the exceedingly\r\nimportant result of the total load of waste discharged by the\r\nriver. Dividing the volume of this load by the area of the river\r\nbasin gives another result of the greatest geological interest,--\r\nthe rate at which the region is being lowered by the combined\r\naction of weathering and erosion, or the rate of denudation.\r\n\r\nTHE RATE OF DENUDATION OF RIVER BASINS. This rate varies widely.\r\nThe Mississippi basin may be taken as a representative land\r\nsurface because of the varieties of surface, altitude and slope,\r\nclimate, and underlying rocks which are included in its great\r\nextent. Careful measurements show that the Mississippi basin is\r\nnow being lowered at a rate of one four-thousandth of a foot a\r\nyear, or one foot in four thousand years. Taking this as the\r\naverage rate of denudation for the land surfaces of the globe,\r\nestimates have been made of the length of time required at this\r\nrate to wash and wear the continents to the level of the sea. As\r\nthe average elevation of the lands of the globe is reckoned at\r\n2411 feet, this result would occur in nine or ten million years,\r\nif the present rate of denudation should remain unchanged. But\r\neven if no movements of the earth's crust should lift or depress\r\nthe continents, the rate of wear and the removal of waste from\r\ntheir surfaces will not remain the same. It must constantly\r\ndecrease as the lands are worn nearer to sea level and their\r\nslopes become more gentle. The length of time required to wear\r\nthem away is therefore far in excess of that just stated.\r\n\r\nThe drainage area of the Potomac is 11,000 square miles. The silt\r\nbrought down in suspension in a year would cover a square mile to\r\nthe depth of four feet. At what rate is the Potomac basin being\r\nlowered from this cause alone?\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the Upper Ganges is lowering its basin at the\r\nrate of one foot in 823 years, and the Po one foot in 720 years.\r\nWhy so much faster than the Potomac and the Mississippi?\r\n\r\nHOW STREAMS GET THEIR LOADS. The load of streams is derived from a\r\nnumber of sources, the larger part being supplied by the\r\nweathering of valley slopes. We have noticed how the mantle of\r\nwaste creeps and washes to the stream ways. Watching the run-off\r\nduring a rain, as it hurries muddy with waste along the gutter or\r\nwashes down the hillside, we may see the beginning of the route by\r\nwhich the larger part of their load is delivered to rivers.\r\nStreams also secure some of their load by wearing it from their\r\nbeds and banks,--a process called erosion.\r\n\r\nEROSION\r\n\r\nStreams erode their beds chiefly by means of their bottom load,--\r\nthe stones of various sizes and the sand and even the fine mud\r\nwhich they sweep along. With these tools they smooth, grind, and\r\nrasp the rock of their beds, using them in much the fashion of\r\nsandpaper or a file.\r\n\r\nWEATHERING OF RIVER BEDS. The erosion of stream beds is greatly\r\nhelped by the work of the weather. Especially at low water more or\r\nless of the bed is exposed to the action of frost and heat and\r\ncold, joints are opened, rocks are pried loose and broken up and\r\nmade ready to be swept away by the stream at time of flood.\r\n\r\nPOTHOLES. In rapids streams also drill out their rocky beds. Where\r\nsome slight depression gives rise to an eddy, the pebbles which\r\ngather in it are whirled round and round, and, acting like the bit\r\nof an auger, bore out a cylindrical pit called a pothole. Potholes\r\nsometimes reach a depth of a score of feet. Where they are\r\nnumerous they aid materially in deepening the channel, as the\r\nwalls between them are worn away and they coalesce.\r\n\r\nWATERFALLS. One of the most effective means of erosion which the\r\nriver possesses is the waterfall. The plunging water dislodges\r\nstones from the face of the ledge over which it pours, and often\r\nundermines it by excavating a deep pit at its base. Slice after\r\nslice is thus thrown down from the front of the cliff, and the\r\ncataract cuts its way upstream leaving a gorge behind it.\r\n\r\nNIAGARA FALLS. The Niagara River flows from Lake Erie at Buffalo in\r\na broad channel which it has cut but a few feet below the level of\r\nthe region. Some thirteen miles from the outlet it plunges over a\r\nledge one hundred and seventy feet high into the head of a narrow\r\ngorge which extends for seven miles to the escarpment of the\r\nupland in which the gorge is cut. The strata which compose the\r\nupland dip gently upstream and consist at top of a massive\r\nlimestone, at the Falls about eighty feet thick, and below of soft\r\nand easily weathered shale. Beneath the Falls the underlying shale\r\nis cut and washed away by the descending water and retreats also\r\nbecause of weathering, while the overhanging limestone breaks down\r\nin huge blocks from time to time.\r\n\r\nNiagara is divided by Goat Island into the Horseshoe Falls and the\r\nAmerican Falls. The former is supplied by the main current of the\r\nriver, and from the semicircular sweep of its rim a sheet of water\r\nin places at least fifteen or twenty feet deep plunges into a pool\r\na little less than two hundred feet in depth. Here the force of\r\nthe falling water is sufficient to move about the fallen blocks of\r\nlimestone and use them in the excavation of the shale of the bed.\r\nAt the American Falls the lesser branch of the river, which flows\r\nalong the American side of Goat Island, pours over the side of the\r\ngorge and breaks upon a high talus of limestone blocks which its\r\nsmaller volume of water is unable to grind to pieces and remove.\r\n\r\nA series of surveys have determined that from 1842 to 1890 the\r\nHorseshoe Falls retreated at the rate of 2.18 feet per year, while\r\nthe American Falls retreated at the rate of 0.64 feet in the same\r\nperiod. We cannot doubt that the same agency which is now\r\nlengthening the gorge at this rapid rate has cut it back its\r\nentire length of seven miles.\r\n\r\nWhile Niagara Falls have been cutting back a gorge seven miles\r\nlong and from two hundred to three hundred feet deep, the river\r\nabove the Falls has eroded its bed scarcely below the level of the\r\nupland on which it flows. Like all streams which are the outlets\r\nof lakes, the Niagara flows out of Lake Erie clear of sediment, as\r\nfrom a settling basin, and carries no tools with which to abrade\r\nits bed. We may infer from this instance how slight is the erosive\r\npower of clear water on hard rock.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the rate of recession of the combined volumes of the\r\nAmerican and Horseshoe Falls was three feet a year below Goat\r\nIsland, and ASSUMING THAT THIS RATE HAS BEEN UNIFORM IN THE PAST,\r\nhow long is it since the Niagara River fell over the edge of the\r\nescarpment where now is the mouth of the present gorge?\r\n\r\nThe profile of the bed of the Niagara along the gorge (Fig. 39)\r\nshows alternating deeps and shallows which cannot be accounted\r\nfor, except in a single instance, by the relative hardness of the\r\nrocks of the river bed. The deeps do not exceed that at the foot\r\nof the Horseshoe Falls at the present time. When the gorge was\r\nbeing cut along the shallows, how did the Falls compare in\r\nexcavating power, in force, and volume with the Niagara of to-day?\r\nHow did the rate of recession at those times compare with the\r\npresent rate? Is the assumption made above that the rate of\r\nrecession has been uniform correct?\r\n\r\nThe first stretch of shallows below the Falls causes a tumultuous\r\nrapid impossible to sound. Its depth has been estimated at thirty-\r\nfive feet. From what data could such an estimate be made?\r\n\r\nSuggest a reason why the Horseshoe Falls are convex upstream.\r\n\r\nAt the present rate of recession which will reach the head of Goat\r\nIsland the sooner, the American or the Horseshoe Falls? What will\r\nbe the fate of the Falls left behind when the other has passed\r\nbeyond the head of the island?\r\n\r\nThe rate at which a stream erodes its bed depends in part upon the\r\nnature of the rocks over which it flows. Will a stream deepen its\r\nchannel more rapidly on massive or on thin-bedded and close-\r\njointed rocks? on horizontal strata or on strata steeply inclined?\r\n\r\nDEPOSITION\r\n\r\nWhile the river carries its invisible load of dissolved rock on\r\nwithout stop to the sea, its load of visible waste is subject to\r\nmany delays en route. Now and again it is laid aside, to be picked\r\nup later and carried some distance farther on its way. One of the\r\nmost striking features of the river therefore is the waste\r\naccumulated along its course, in bars and islands in the channel,\r\nbeneath its bed, and in flood plains along its banks. All this\r\nalluvium, to use a general term for river deposits, with which the\r\nvalley is cumbered is really en route to the sea; it is only\r\ntemporarily laid aside to resume its journey later on. Constantly\r\nthe river is destroying and rebuilding its alluvial deposits, here\r\ncutting and there depositing along its banks, here eroding and\r\nthere building a bar, here excavating its bed and there filling it\r\nup, and at all times carrying the material picked up at one point\r\nsome distance on downstream before depositing it at another.\r\n\r\nThese deposits are laid down by slackening currents where the\r\nvelocity of the stream is checked, as on the inner side of curves,\r\nand where the slope of the bed is diminished, and in the lee of\r\nislands, bridge piers and projecting points of land. How slight is\r\nthe check required to cause a current to drop a large part of its\r\nload may be inferred from the law of the relation of the\r\ntransporting power to the velocity. If the velocity is decreased\r\none half, the current can move fragments but one sixty-fourth the\r\nsize of those which it could move before, and must drop all those\r\nof larger size.\r\n\r\nWill a river deposit more at low water or at flood? when rising or\r\nwhen falling?\r\n\r\nSTRATIFICATION. River deposits are stratified, as may be seen in\r\nany fresh cut in banks or bars. The waste of which they are built\r\nhas been sorted and deposited in layers, one above another; some\r\nof finer and some of coarser material. The sorting action of\r\nrunning water depends on the fact that its transporting power\r\nvaries with the velocity. A current whose diminishing velocity\r\ncompels it to drop coarse gravel, for example, is still able to\r\nmove all the finer waste of its load, and separating it from the\r\ngravel, carries it on downstream; while at a later time slower\r\ncurrents may deposit on the gravel bed layers of sand, and, still\r\nlater, slack water may leave on these a layer of mud. In case of\r\nmaterials lighter than water the transporting power does not\r\ndepend on the velocity, and logs of wood, for instance, are\r\nfloated on to the sea on the slowest as well as on the most rapid\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\nCROSS BEDDING. A section of a bar exposed at low water may show\r\nthat it is formed of layers of sand, or coarser stuff, inclined\r\ndownstream as steeply often as the angle of repose of the\r\nmaterial. From a boat anchored over the lower end of a submerged\r\nsand bar we may observe the way in which this structure, called\r\ncross bedding, is produced. Sand is continually pushed over the\r\nedge of the bar at b (Fig. 42) and comes to rest in successive\r\nlayers on the sloping surface. At the same time the bar may be\r\nworn away at the upper end, a, and thus slowly advance down\r\nstream. While the deposit is thus cross bedded, it constitutes as\r\na whole a stratum whose upper and lower surfaces are about\r\nhorizontal. In sections of river banks one may often see a\r\nvertical succession of cross-bedded strata, each built in the way\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nWATER WEAR. The coarser material of river deposits, such as\r\ncobblestones, gravel, and the larger grains of sand, are WATER\r\nWORN, or rounded, except when near their source. Rolling along the\r\nbottom they have been worn round by impact and friction as they\r\nrubbed against one another and the rocky bed of the stream.\r\n\r\nExperiments have shown that angular fragments of granite lose\r\nnearly half their weight and become well rounded after traveling\r\nfifteen miles in rotating cylinders partly filled with water.\r\nMarbles are cheaply made in Germany out of small limestone cubes\r\nset revolving in a current of water between a rotating bed of\r\nstone and a block of oak, the process requiring but about fifteen\r\nminutes. It has been found that in the upper reaches of mountain\r\nstreams a descent of less than a mile is sufficient to round\r\npebbles of granite.\r\n\r\nLAND FORMS DUE TO RIVER EROSION\r\n\r\nRIVER VALLEYS. In their courses to the sea, rivers follow valleys\r\nof various forms, some shallow and some deep, some narrow and some\r\nwide. Since rivers are known to erode their beds and banks, it is\r\na fair presumption that, aided by the weather, they have excavated\r\nthe valleys in which they flow.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a bird's-eye view or a map of a region shows the\r\nsignificant fact that the valleys of a system unite with one\r\nanother in a branch work, as twigs meet their stems and the\r\nbranches of a tree its trunk. Each valley, from that of the\r\nsmallest rivulet to that of the master stream, is proportionate to\r\nthe size of the stream which occupies it. With a few explainable\r\nexceptions the valleys of tributaries join that of the trunk\r\nstream at a level; there is no sudden descent or break in the bed\r\nat the point of juncture. These are the natural consequences which\r\nmust follow if the land has long been worked upon by streams, and\r\nno other process has ever been suggested which is competent to\r\nproduce them. We must conclude that valley systems have been\r\nformed by the river systems which drain them, aided by the work of\r\nthe weather; they are not gaping fissures in the earth's crust, as\r\nearly observers imagined, but are the furrows which running water\r\nhas drawn upon the land.\r\n\r\nAs valleys are made by the slow wear of streams and the action of\r\nthe weather, they pass in their development through successive\r\nstages, each of which has its own characteristic features. We may\r\ntherefore classify rivers and valleys according to the stage which\r\nthey have reached in their life history from infancy to old age.\r\n\r\nYOUNG RIVER VALLEYS\r\n\r\nINFANCY. The Red River of the North. A region in northwestern\r\nMinnesota and the adjacent portions of North Dakota and Manitoba\r\nwas so recently covered by the waters of an extinct lake, known as\r\nLake Agassiz, that the surface remains much as it was left when\r\nthe lake was drained away. The flat floor, spread smooth with\r\nlake-laid silts, is still a plain, to the eye as level as the sea.\r\nAcross it the Red River of the North and its branches run in\r\nnarrow, ditch-like channels, steep-sided and shallow, not\r\nexceeding sixty feet in depth, their gradients differing little\r\nfrom the general slopes of the region. The trunk streams have but\r\nfew tributaries; the river system, like a sapling with few limbs,\r\nis still undeveloped. Along the banks of the trunk streams short\r\ngullies are slowly lengthening headwards, like growing twigs which\r\nare sometime to become large branches.\r\n\r\nThe flat interstream areas are as yet but little scored by\r\ndrainage lines, and in wet weather water lingers in ponds in any\r\ninitial depressions on the plain.\r\n\r\nCONTOURS. In order to read the topographic maps of the text-book\r\nand the laboratory the student should know that contours are lines\r\ndrawn on maps to represent relief, all points on any given contour\r\nbeing of equal height above sea level. The CONTOUR INTERVAL is the\r\nuniform vertical distance between two adjacent contours and varies\r\non different maps.\r\n\r\nTo express regions of faint relief a contour interval of ten or\r\ntwenty feet is commonly selected; while in mountainous regions a\r\ncontour interval of two hundred and fifty, five hundred, or even\r\none thousand feet may be necessary in order that the contours may\r\nnot be too crowded for easy reading.\r\n\r\nWhether a river begins its life on a lake plain, as in the example\r\njust cited, or upon a coastal plain lifted from beneath the sea or\r\non a spread of glacial drift left by the retreat of continental\r\nice sheets, such as covers much of Canada and the northeastern\r\nparts of the United States, its infantile stage presents the same\r\ncharacteristic features,--a narrow and shallow valley, with\r\nundeveloped tributaries and undrained interstream areas. Ground\r\nwater stands high, and, exuding in the undrained initial\r\ndepressions, forms marshes and lakes.\r\n\r\nLAKES. Lakes are perhaps the most obvious of these fleeting\r\nfeatures of infancy. They are short-lived, for their destruction\r\nis soon accomplished by several means. As a river system advances\r\ntoward maturity the deepening and extending valleys of the\r\ntributaries lower the ground-water surface and invade the\r\nundrained depressions of the region. Lakes having outlets are\r\ndrained away as their basin rims are cut down by the outflowing\r\nstreams,--a slow process where the rim is of hard rock, but a\r\nrapid one where it is of soft material such as glacial drift.\r\n\r\nLakes are effaced also by the filling of their basins. Inflowing\r\nstreams and the wash of rains bring in waste. Waves abrade the\r\nshore and strew the debris worn from it over the lake bed. Shallow\r\nlakes are often filled with organic matter from decaying\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nDoes the outflowing stream, from a lake carry sediment? How does\r\nthis fact affect its erosive power on hard rock? on loose\r\nmaterial?\r\n\r\nLake Geneva is a well-known example of a lake in process of\r\nobliteration. The inflowing Rhone has already displaced the waters\r\nof the lake for a length of twenty miles with the waste brought\r\ndown from the high Alps. For this distance there extends up the\r\nRhone Valley an alluvial plain, which has grown lakeward at the\r\nrate of a mile and a half since Roman times, as proved by the\r\ndistance inland at which a Roman port now stands.\r\n\r\nHow rapidly a lake may be silted up under exceptionally favorable\r\nconditions is illustrated by the fact that over the bottom of the\r\nartificial lake, of thirty-five square miles, formed behind the\r\ngreat dam across the Colorado River at Austin, Texas, sediments\r\nthirty-nine feet deep gathered in seven years.\r\n\r\nLake Mendota, one of the many beautiful lakes of southern\r\nWisconsin, is rapidly cutting back the soft glacial drift of its\r\nshores by means of the abrasion of its waves. While the shallow\r\nbasin is thus broadened, it is also being filled with the waste;\r\nand the time is brought nearer when it will be so shoaled that\r\nvegetation can complete the work of its effacement.\r\n\r\nAlong the margin of a shallow lake mosses, water lilies, grasses,\r\nand other water-loving plants grow luxuriantly. As their decaying\r\nremains accumulate on the bottom, the ring of marsh broadens\r\ninwards, the lake narrows gradually to a small pond set in the\r\nmidst of a wide bog, and finally disappears. All stages in this\r\nprocess of extinction may be seen among the countless lakelets\r\nwhich occupy sags in the recent sheets of glacial drift in the\r\nnorthern states; and more numerous than the lakes which still\r\nremain are those already thus filled with carbonaceous matter\r\nderived from the carbon dioxide of the atmosphere. Such fossil\r\nlakes are marked by swamps or level meadows underlain with muck.\r\n\r\nTHE ADVANCE TO MATURITY. The infantile stage is brief. As a river\r\nadvances toward maturity the initial depressions, the lake basins\r\nof its area, are gradually effaced. By the furrowing action of the\r\nrain wash and the head ward lengthening, of tributaries a\r\nbranchwork of drainage channels grows until it covers the entire\r\narea, and not an acre is left on which the fallen raindrop does\r\nnot find already cut for it an uninterrupted downward path which\r\nleads it on by way of gully, brook, and river to the sea. The\r\ninitial surface of the land, by whatever agency it was modeled, is\r\nnow wholly destroyed; the region is all reduced to valley slopes.\r\n\r\nTHE LONGITUDINAL PROFILE OF A STREAM. This at first corresponds\r\nwith the initial surface of the region on which the stream begins\r\nto flow, although its way may lead through basins and down steep\r\ndescents. The successive profiles to which it reduces its bed are\r\nillustrated in Figure 51. As the gradient, or rate of descent of\r\nits bed, is lowered, the velocity of the river is decreased until\r\nits lessening energy is wholly consumed in carrying its load and\r\nit can no longer erode its bed. The river is now AT GRADE, and its\r\ncapacity is just equal to its load. If now its load is increased\r\nthe stream deposits, and thus builds up, or AGGRADES, its bed. On\r\nthe other hand, if its load is diminished it has energy to spare,\r\nand resuming its work of erosion, DEGRADES its bed. In either case\r\nthe stream continues aggrading or degrading until a new gradient\r\nis found where the velocity is just sufficient to move the load,\r\nand here again it reaches grade.\r\n\r\nV-VALLEYS. Vigorous rivers well armed with waste make short work\r\nof cutting their beds to grade, and thus erode narrow, steep-sided\r\ngorges only wide enough at the base to accommodate the stream. The\r\nsteepness of the valley slopes depends on the relative rates at\r\nwhich the bed is cut down by the stream and the sides are worn\r\nback by the weather. In resistant rock a swift, well-laden stream\r\nmay saw out a gorge whose sides are nearly or even quite vertical,\r\nbut as a rule young valleys whose streams have not yet reached\r\ngrade are V-shaped; their sides flare at the top because here the\r\nrocks have longest been opened up to the action of the weather.\r\nSome of the deepest canyons may be found where a rising land mass,\r\neither mountain range or plateau, has long maintained by its\r\ncontinued uplift the rivers of the region above grade.\r\n\r\nIn the northern hemisphere the north sides of river valleys are\r\nsometimes of more gentle slope than the south sides. Can you\r\nsuggest a reason?\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND CANYON OF THE COLORADO RIVER IN ARIZONA. The Colorado\r\nRiver trenches the high plateau of northern Arizona with a\r\ncolossal canyon two hundred and eighteen miles long and more than\r\na mile in greatest depth. The rocks in which the canyon is cut are\r\nfor the most part flat-lying, massive beds of limestones and\r\nsandstones, with some shales, beneath which in places harder\r\ncrystalline rocks are disclosed. Where the canyon is deepest its\r\nwalls have been profoundly dissected. Lateral ravines have widened\r\ninto immense amphitheaters, leaving between them long ridges of\r\nmountain height, buttressed and rebuttressed with flanking spurs\r\nand carved into majestic architectural forms. From the extremity\r\nof one of these promontories it is two miles or more across the\r\ngulf to the point of the one opposite, and the heads of the\r\namphitheaters are thirteen miles apart.\r\n\r\nThe lower portion of the canyon is much narrower (Fig. 54) and its\r\nwalls of dark crystalline rock sink steeply to the edge of the\r\nriver, a swift, powerful stream a few hundred feet wide, turbid\r\nwith reddish silt, by means of which it continually rasps its\r\nrocky bed as it hurries on. The Colorado is still deepening its\r\ngorge. In the Grand Canyon its gradient is seven and one half feet\r\nto the mile, but, as in all ungraded rivers, the descent is far\r\nfrom uniform. Graded reaches in soft rock alternate with steeper\r\ndeclivities in hard rock, forming rapids such as, for example, a\r\nstretch of ten miles where the fall averages twenty-one feet to\r\nthe mile. Because of these dangerous rapids the few exploring\r\nparties who have traversed the Colorado canyon have done so at the\r\nhazard of their lives.\r\n\r\nThe canyon has been shaped by several agencies. Its depth is due\r\nto the river which has sawed its way far toward the base of a\r\nlofty rising plateau. Acting alone this would have produced a\r\nslitlike gorge little wider than the breadth of the stream. The\r\nimpressive width of the canyon and the magnificent architectural\r\nmasses which fill it are owing to two causes.: Running water has\r\ngulched the walls and weathering has everywhere attacked and\r\ndriven them back. The horizontal harder beds stand out in long\r\nlines of vertical cliffs, often hundreds of feet in height, at\r\nwhose feet talus slopes conceal the outcrop of the weaker strata.\r\nAs the upper cliffs have been sapped and driven back by the\r\nweather, broad platforms are left at their bases and the sides of\r\nthe canyon descend to the river by gigantic steps. Far up and down\r\nthe canyon the eye traces these horizontal layers, like the\r\nflutings of an elaborate molding, distinguishing each by its\r\ncontour as well as by its color and thickness.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canyon of the Colorado is often and rightly cited as an\r\nexample of the stupendous erosion which may be accomplished by a\r\nriver. And yet the Colorado is a young stream and its work is no\r\nmore than well begun. It has not yet wholly reached grade, and the\r\ngreat task of the river and its tributaries--the task of leveling\r\nthe lofty plateau to a low plain and of transporting it grain by\r\ngrain to the sea--still lies almost entirely in the future.\r\n\r\nWATERFALLS AND RAPIDS. Before the bed of a stream is reduced to\r\ngrade it may be broken by abrupt descents which give rise to\r\nwaterfalls and rapids. Such breaks in a river's bed may belong to\r\nthe initial surface over which it began its course; still more\r\ncommonly are they developed in the rock mass through which it is\r\ncutting its valley. Thus, wherever a stream leaves harder rocks to\r\nflow over softer ones the latter are quickly worn below the level\r\nof the former, and a sharp change in slope, with a waterfall or\r\nrapid, results.\r\n\r\nAt time of flood young tributaries with steeper courses than that\r\nof the trunk stream may bring down stones and finer waste, which\r\nthe gentler current cannot move along, and throw them as a dam\r\nacross its way. The rapids thus formed are also ephemeral, for as\r\nthe gradient of the tributaries is lowered the main stream becomes\r\nable to handle the smaller and finer load which they discharge.\r\n\r\nA rare class of falls is produced where the minor tributaries of a\r\nyoung river are not able to keep pace with their master stream in\r\nthe erosion of their beds because of their smaller volume, and\r\nthus join it by plunging over the side of its gorge. But as the\r\nriver approaches grade and slackens its down cutting, the\r\ntributaries sooner or later overtake it, and effacing their falls,\r\nunite with it on a level.\r\n\r\nWaterfalls and rapids of all kinds are evanescent features of a\r\nriver's youth. Like lakes they are soon destroyed, and if any long\r\ntime had already elapsed since their formation they would have\r\nbeen obliterated already.\r\n\r\nLOCAL BASELEVELS. That balanced condition called grade, where a\r\nriver neither degrades its bed by erosion nor aggrades it by\r\ndeposition, is first attained along reaches of soft rocks,\r\nungraded outcrops of hard rocks remaining as barriers which give\r\nrise to rapids or falls. Until these barriers are worn away they\r\nconstitute local baselevels, below which level the stream, up\r\nvalley from them, cannot cut. They are eroded to grade one after\r\nanother, beginning with the least strong, or the one nearest the\r\nmouth of the stream. In a similar way the surface of a lake in a\r\nriver's course constitutes for all inflowing streams a local\r\nbaselevel, which disappears when the basin is filled or drained.\r\n\r\nMATURE AND OLD RIVERS\r\n\r\nMaturity is the stage of a river's complete development and most\r\neffective work. The river system now has well under way its great\r\ntask of wearing down the land mass which it drains and carrying it\r\nparticle by particle to the sea. The relief of the land is now at\r\nits greatest; for the main channels have been sunk to grade, while\r\nthe divides remain but little worn below their initial altitudes.\r\nGround water now stands low. The run-off washes directly to the\r\nstreams, with the least delay and loss by evaporation in ponds and\r\nmarches; the discharge of the river is therefore at its height.\r\nThe entire region is dissected by stream ways. The area of valley\r\nslopes is now largest and sheds to the streams a heavier load of\r\nwaste than ever before. At maturity the river system is doing its\r\ngreatest amount of work both in erosion and in the carriage of\r\nwater and of waste to the sea.\r\n\r\nLATERAL EROSION. On reaching grade a river ceases to scour its\r\nbed, and it does not again begin to do so until some change in\r\nload or volume enables it to find grade at a lower level. On the\r\nother hand, a stream erodes its banks at all stages in its\r\nhistory, and with graded rivers this process, called lateral\r\nerosion, or PLANATION, is specially important. The current of a\r\nstream follows the outer side of all curves or bends in the\r\nchannel, and on this side it excavates its bed the deepest and\r\ncontinually wears and saps its banks. On the inner side deposition\r\ntakes place in the more shallow and slower-moving water. The inner\r\nbank of bends is thus built out while the outer bank is worn away.\r\nBy swinging its curves against the valley sides a graded river\r\ncontinually cuts a wider and wider floor. The V-valley of youth is\r\nthus changed by planation to a flat-floored valley with flaring\r\nsides which gradually become subdued by the weather to gentle\r\nslopes. While widening their valleys streams maintain a constant\r\nwidth of channel, so that a wide-floored valley does not signify\r\nthat it ever was occupied by a river of equal width.\r\n\r\nTHE GRADIENT. The gradients of graded rivers differ widely. A\r\nlarge river with a light load reaches grade on a faint slope,\r\nwhile a smaller stream heavily burdened with waste requires a\r\nsteep slope to give it velocity sufficient to move the load.\r\n\r\nThe Platte, a graded river of Nebraska with its headwaters in the\r\nRocky Mountains, is enfeebled by the semi-arid climate of the\r\nGreat Plains and surcharged with the waste brought down both by\r\nits branches in the mountains and by those whose tracks lie over\r\nthe soft rocks of the plains. It is compelled to maintain a\r\ngradient of eight feet to the mile in western Nebraska. The Ohio\r\nreaches grade with a slope of less than four inches to the mile\r\nfrom Cincinnati to its mouth, and the powerful Mississippi washes\r\nalong its load with a fall of but three inches per mile from Cairo\r\nto the Gulf.\r\n\r\nOther things being equal, which of graded streams will have the\r\nsteeper gradient, a trunk stream or its tributaries? a stream\r\nsupplied with gravel or one with silt?\r\n\r\nOther factors remaining the same, what changes would occur if the\r\nPlatte should increase in volume? What changes would occur if the\r\nload should be increased in amount or in coarseness?\r\n\r\nTHE OLD AGE OF RIVERS. As rivers pass their prime, as denudation\r\nlowers the relief of the region, less waste and finer is washed\r\nover the gentler slopes of the lowering hills. With smaller loads\r\nto carry, the rivers now deepen their valleys and find grade with\r\nfainter declivities nearer the level of the sea. This limit of the\r\nlevel of the sea beneath which they cannot erode is known as\r\nbaselevel. [Footnote: The term \"baselevel\" is also used to\r\ndesignate the close approximation to sea level to which streams\r\nare able to subdue the land.] As streams grow old they approach\r\nmore and more closely to baselevel, although they are never able\r\nto attain it. Some slight slope is needed that water may flow and\r\nwaste be transported over the land. Meanwhile the relief of the\r\nland has ever lessened. The master streams and their main\r\ntributaries now wander with sluggish currents over the broad\r\nvalley floors which they have planed away; while under the erosion\r\nof their innumerable branches and the wear of the weather the\r\ndivides everywhere are lowered and subdued to more and more gentle\r\nslopes. Mountains and high plateaus are thus reduced to rolling\r\nhills, and at last to plains, surmounted only by such hills as may\r\nstill be unreduced to the common level, because of the harder\r\nrocks of which they are composed or because of their distance from\r\nthe main erosion channels. Such regions of faint relief, worn down\r\nto near base level by subaerial agencies, are known as PENEPLAINS\r\n(almost plains). Any residual masses which rise above them are\r\ncalled MONADNOCKS, from the name of a conical peak of New\r\nHampshire which overlooks the now uplifted peneplain of southern\r\nNew England.\r\n\r\nIn its old age a region becomes mantled with thick sheets of fine\r\nand weathered waste, slowly moving over the faint slopes toward\r\nthe water ways and unbroken by ledges of bare rock. In other\r\nwords, the waste mantle also is now graded, and as waterfalls have\r\nbeen effaced in the river beds, so now any ledges in the wide\r\nstreams of waste are worn away and covered beneath smooth slopes\r\nof fine soil. Ground water stands high and may exude in areas of\r\nswamp. In youth the land mass was roughhewn and cut deep by stream\r\nerosion. In old age the faint reliefs of the land dissolve away,\r\nchiefly under the action of the weather, beneath their cloak of\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nTHE CYCLE OF EROSION. The successive stages through which a land\r\nmass passes while it is being leveled to the sea constitute\r\ntogether a cycle of erosion. Each stage of the cycle from infancy\r\nto old age leaves, as we have seen, its characteristic records in\r\nthe forms sculptured on the land, such as the shapes of valleys\r\nand the contours of hills and plains. The geologist is thus able\r\nto determine by the land forms of any region the stage in the\r\nerosion cycle to which it now belongs, and knowing what are the\r\nearlier stages of the cycle, to read something of the geological\r\nhistory of the region.\r\n\r\nINTERRUPTED CYCLES. So long a time is needed to reduce a land mass\r\nto baselevel that the process is seldom if ever completed during a\r\nsingle uninterrupted cycle of erosion. Of all the various\r\ninterruptions which may occur the most important are gradual\r\nmovements of the earth's crust, by which a region is either\r\ndepressed or elevated relative to sea level.\r\n\r\nThe DEPRESSION of a region hastens its old age by decreasing the\r\ngradient of streams, by destroying their power to excavate their\r\nbeds and carry their loads to a degree corresponding to the amount\r\nof the depression, and by lessening the amount of work they have\r\nto do. The slackened river currents deposit their waste in Hood\r\nplains which increase in height as the subsidence continues. The\r\nlower courses of the rivers are invaded by the sea and become\r\nestuaries, while the lower tributaries are cut off from the trunk\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nELEVATION, on the other hand, increases the activity of all\r\nagencies of weathering, erosion, and transportation, restores the\r\nregion to its youth, and inaugurates a new cycle of erosion.\r\nStreams are given a steeper gradient, greater velocity, and\r\nincreased energy to carry their loads and wear their beds. They\r\ncut through the alluvium of their flood plains, leaving it on\r\neither bank as successive terraces, and intrench themselves in the\r\nunderlying rock. In their older and wider valleys they cut narrow,\r\nsteep-walled inner gorges, in which they flow swiftly over rocky\r\nfloors, broken here and there by falls and rapids where a harder\r\nlayer of rock has been discovered. Winding streams on plains may\r\nthus incise their meanders in solid rock as the plains are\r\ngradually uplifted. Streams which are thus restored to their youth\r\nare said to be REVIVED.\r\n\r\nAs streams cut deeper and the valley slopes are steepened, the\r\nmantle of waste of the region undergoing elevation is set in more\r\nrapid movement. It is now removed particle by particle faster than\r\nit forms. As the waste mantle thins, weathering attacks the rocks\r\nof the region more energetically until an equilibrium is reached\r\nagain; the rocks waste rapidly and their waste is as rapidly\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nDISSECTED PENEPLAINS. When a rise of the land brings one cycle to\r\nan end and begins another, the characteristic land forms of each\r\ncycle are found together and the topography of the region is\r\ncomposite until the second cycle is so far advanced that the land\r\nforms of the first cycle are entirely destroyed. The contrast\r\nbetween the land surfaces of the later and the earlier cycles is\r\nmost striking when the earlier had advanced to age and the later\r\nis still in youth. Thus many peneplains which have been elevated\r\nand dissected have been recognized by the remnants of their\r\nancient erosion surfaces, and the length of time which has elapsed\r\nsince their uplift has been measured by the stage to which the new\r\ncycle has advanced.\r\n\r\nTHE PIEDMONT BELT. As an example of an ancient peneplain uplifted\r\nand dissected we may cite the Piedmont Belt, a broad upland lying\r\nbetween the Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic coastal plain.\r\nThe surface of the Piedmont is gently rolling. The divides, which\r\nare often smooth areas of considerable width, rise to a common\r\nplane, and from them one sees in every direction an even sky line\r\nexcept where in places some lone hill or ridge may lift itself\r\nabove the general level (Fig. 62). The surface is an ancient one,\r\nfor the mantle of residual waste lies deep upon it, soils are\r\nreddened by long oxidation, and the rocks are rotted to a depth of\r\nscores of feet.\r\n\r\nAt present, however, the waste mantle is not forming so rapidly as\r\nit is being removed. The streams of the upland are actively\r\nengaged in its destruction. They flow swiftly in narrow, rock-\r\nwalled valleys over rocky beds. This contrast between the young\r\nstreams and the aged surface which they are now so vigorously\r\ndissecting can only be explained by the theory that the region\r\nonce stood lower than at present and has recently been upraised.\r\nIf now we imagine the valleys refilled with the waste which the\r\nstreams have swept away, and the upland lowered, we restore the\r\nPiedmont region to the condition in which it stood before its\r\nuplift and dissection,--a gently rolling plain, surmounted here\r\nand there by isolated hills and ridges.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the ancient Piedmont plain, as it may be restored\r\nfrom the remnants of it found on the divides, is not in accordance\r\nwith the structures of the country rocks. Where these are exposed\r\nto view they are seen to be far from horizontal. On the walls of\r\nriver gorges they dip steeply and in various directions and the\r\nstreams flow over their upturned edges. As shown in Figure 67, the\r\nrocks of the Piedmont have been folded and broken and tilted.\r\n\r\nIt is not reasonable to believe that when the rocks of the\r\nPiedmont were thus folded and otherwise deformed the surface of\r\nthe region was a plain. The upturned layers have not always\r\nstopped abruptly at the even surface of the Piedmont plain which\r\nnow cuts across them. They are the bases of great folds and tilted\r\nblocks which must once have risen high in air. The complex and\r\ndisorderly structures of the Piedmont rocks are those seen in\r\ngreat mountain ranges, and there is every reason to believe that\r\nthese rocks after their deformation rose to mountain height.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Piedmont plain cuts across these upturned rocks as\r\nindependently of their structure as the even surface of the sawed\r\nstump of some great tree is independent of the direction of its\r\nfibers. Hence the Piedmont plain as it was before its uplift was\r\nnot a coastal plain formed of strata spread in horizontal sheets\r\nbeneath the sea and then uplifted; nor was it a structural plain,\r\ndue to the resistance to erosion of some hard, flat-lying layer of\r\nrock. Even surfaces developed on rocks of discordant structure,\r\nsuch as the Piedmont shows, are produced by long denudation, and\r\nwe may consider the Piedmont as a peneplain formed by the wearing\r\ndown of mountain ranges, and recently uplifted.\r\n\r\nTHE LAURENTIAN PENEPLAIN. This is the name given to a denuded\r\nsurface on very ancient rocks which extends from the Arctic Ocean\r\nto the St. Lawrence River and Lake Superior, with small areas also\r\nin northern Wisconsin and New York. Throughout this U-shaped area,\r\nwhich incloses Hudson Bay within its arms, the country rocks have\r\nthe complicated and contorted structures which characterize\r\nmountain ranges. But the surface of the area is by no means\r\nmountainous. The sky line when viewed from the divides is unbroken\r\nby mountain peaks or rugged hills. The surface of the arm west of\r\nHudson Bay is gently undulating and that of the eastern arm has\r\nbeen roughened to low-rolling hills and dissected in places by\r\nsuch deep river gorges as those of the Ottawa and Saguenay. This\r\nimmense area may be regarded as an ancient peneplain truncating\r\nthe bases of long-vanished mountains and dissected after\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\nIn the examples cited the uplift has been a broad one and to\r\ncomparatively little height. Where peneplains have been uplifted\r\nto great height and have since been well dissected, and where they\r\nhave been upfolded and broken and uptilted, their recognition\r\nbecomes more difficult. Yet recent observers have found evidences\r\nof ancient lowland surfaces of erosion on the summits of the\r\nAllegheny ridges, the Cascade Mountains (Fig. 69), and the western\r\nslope of the Sierra Nevadas.\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. We have here an example of an\r\narea the latter part of whose geological history may be deciphered\r\nby means of its land forms. The generalized section of Figure 70,\r\nwhich passes from west to east across a portion of the region in\r\neastern Tennessee, shows on the west a part of the broad\r\nCumberland plateau. On the east is a roughened upland platform,\r\nfrom which rise in the distance the peaks of the Great Smoky\r\nMountains. The plateau, consisting of strata but little changed\r\nfrom their original flat-lying attitude, and the platform,\r\ndeveloped on rocks of disordered structure made crystalline by\r\nheat and pressure, both stand at the common level of the line AB.\r\nThey are separated by the Appalachian valley, forty miles wide,\r\ncut in strata which have been folded and broken into long narrow\r\nblocks. The valley is traversed lengthwise by long, low ridges,\r\nthe outcropping edges of the harder strata, which rise to about\r\nthe same level,--that of the line cd. Between these ridges stretch\r\nvalley lowlands at the level ef excavated in the weaker rocks,\r\nwhile somewhat below them lie the channels of the present streams\r\nnow busily engaged in deepening their beds.\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY LOWLANDS. Were they planed by graded or ungraded\r\nstreams? Have the present streams reached grade? Why did the\r\nstreams cease widening the floors of the valley lowlands? How long\r\nsince? When will they begin anew the work of lateral planation?\r\nWhat effect will this have on the ridges if the present cycle of\r\nerosion continues long uninterrupted?\r\n\r\nTHE RIDGES OF THE APPALACHIAN VALLEY. Why do they stand above the\r\nvalley lowlands? Why do their summits lie in about the same plane?\r\nRefilling the valleys intervening between these ridges with the\r\nmaterial removed by the streams, what is the nature of the surface\r\nthus restored? Does this surface cd accord with the rock\r\nstructures on which' it has been developed? How may it have been\r\nmade? At what height did the land stand then, compared with its\r\npresent height? What elevations stood above the surface cd? Why?\r\nWhat name may you use to designate them? How does the length of\r\ntime needed to develop the surface cd compare with that needed to\r\ndevelop the valley lowlands?\r\n\r\nTHE PLATFORM AND PLATEAU. Why do they stand at a common level ab?\r\nOf what surface may they be remnants? Is it accordant with the\r\nrock structure? How was it produced? What unconsumed masses\r\noverlooked it? Did the rocks of the Appalachian valley stand above\r\nthis surface when it was produced? Did they then stand below it?\r\nCompare the time needed to develop this surface with that needed\r\nto develop cd. Which surface is the older?\r\n\r\nHow many cycles of erosion are represented here? Give the erosion\r\nhistory of the region by cycles, beginning with the oldest, the\r\nwork done in each and the work left undone, what brought each\r\ncycle to a close, and how long relatively it continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nRIVER DEPOSITS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe characteristic features of river deposits and the forms which\r\nthey assume may be treated under three heads: (1) valley deposits,\r\n(2) basin deposits, and (3) deltas.\r\n\r\nVALLEY DEPOSITS\r\n\r\nFLOOD PLAINS are the surfaces of the alluvial deposits which\r\nstreams build along their courses at times of flood. A swift\r\ncurrent then sweeps along the channel, while a shallow sheet of\r\nwater moves slowly over the flood plain, spreading upon it a thin\r\nlayer of sediment. It has been estimated that each inundation of\r\nthe Nile leaves a layer of fertilizing silt three hundredths of an\r\ninch thick over the flood plain of Egypt.\r\n\r\nFlood plains may consist of a thin spread of alluvium over the\r\nflat rock floor of a valley which is being widened by the lateral\r\nerosion of a graded stream (Fig. 60). Flood-plain deposits of\r\ngreat thickness may be built by aggrading rivers even in valleys\r\nwhose rock floors have never been thus widened.\r\n\r\nA cross section of a flood plain shows that it is highest next the\r\nriver, sloping gradually thence to the valley sides. These wide\r\nnatural embankments are due to the fact that the river deposit is\r\nheavier near the bank, where the velocity of the silt-laden\r\nchannel current is first checked by contact with the slower-moving\r\noverflow.\r\n\r\nThus banked off from the stream, the outer portions of a flood\r\nplain are often ill-drained and swampy, and here vegetal deposits,\r\nsuch as peat, may be interbedded with river silts.\r\n\r\nA map of a wide flood plain, such as that of the Mississippi or\r\nthe Missouri (Fig. 77), shows that the courses of the tributaries\r\non entering it are deflected downstream. Why?\r\n\r\nThe aggrading streams by which flood plains are constructed\r\ngradually build their immediate banks and beds to higher and\r\nhigher levels, and therefore find it easy at times of great floods\r\nto break their natural embankments and take new courses over the\r\nplain. In this way they aggrade each portion of it in turn by\r\nmeans of their shifting channels,\r\n\r\nBRAIDED CHANNELS. A river actively engaged in aggrading its valley\r\nwith coarse waste builds a flood plain of comparatively steep\r\ngradient and often flows down it in a fairly direct course and\r\nthrough a network of braided channels. From time to time a channel\r\nbecomes choked with waste, and the water no longer finding room in\r\nit breaks out and cuts and builds itself a new way which reunites\r\ndown valley with the other channels. Thus there becomes\r\nestablished a network of ever-changing channels inclosing low\r\nislands of sand and gravel.\r\n\r\nTERRACES. While aggrading streams thus tend to shift their\r\nchannels, degrading streams, on the contrary, become more and more\r\ndeeply intrenched in their valleys. It often occurs that a stream,\r\nafter having built a flood plain, ceases to aggrade its bed\r\nbecause of a lessened load or for other reasons, such as an uplift\r\nof the region, and begins instead to degrade it. It leaves the\r\noriginal flood plain out of reach of even the highest floods. When\r\nagain it reaches grade at a lower level it produces a new flood\r\nplain by lateral erosion in the older deposits, remnants of which\r\nstand as terraces on one or both sides of the valley. In this way\r\na valley may be lined with a succession of terraces at different\r\nlevels, each level representing an abandoned flood plain.\r\n\r\nMEANDERS. Valleys aggraded with fine waste form well-nigh level\r\nplains over which streams wind from side to side of a direct\r\ncourse in symmetric bends known as meanders, from the name of a\r\nwinding river of Asia Minor. The giant Mississippi has developed\r\nmeanders with a radius of one and one half miles, but a little\r\ncreek may display on its meadow as perfect curves only a rod or so\r\nin radius. On the flood plain of either river or creek we may find\r\nexamples of the successive stages in the development of the\r\nmeander, from its beginning in the slight initial bend sufficient\r\nto deflect the current against the outer side. Eroding here and\r\ndepositing on the inner side of the bend, it gradually reaches\r\nfirst the open bend whose width and length are not far from equal,\r\nand later that of the horseshoe meander whose diameter transverse\r\nto the course of the stream is much greater than that parallel\r\nwith it. Little by little the neck of land projecting into the\r\nbend is narrowed, until at last it is cut through and a \"cut-off\"\r\nis established. The old channel is now silted up at both ends and\r\nbecomes a crescentic lagoon, or oxbow lake, which fills gradually\r\nto an arc-shaped shallow depression.\r\n\r\nFLOOD PLAINS CHARACTERISTIC OF MATURE RIVERS. On reaching grade a\r\nstream planes a flat floor for its continually widening valley.\r\nEver cutting on the outer bank of its curves, it deposits on the\r\ninner bank scroll-like flood-plain patches. For a while the valley\r\nbluffs do not give its growing meanders room to develop to their\r\nnormal size, but as planation goes on, the bluffs are driven back\r\nto the full width of the meander belt and still later to a width\r\nwhich gives room for broad stretches of flood plain on either\r\nside.\r\n\r\nUsually a river first attains grade near its mouth, and here first\r\nsinks its bed to near baselevel. Extending its graded course\r\nupstream by cutting away barrier after barrier, it comes to have a\r\nwidened and mature valley over its lower course, while its young\r\nheadwaters are still busily eroding their beds. Its ungraded\r\nbranches may thus bring down to its lower course more waste than\r\nit is competent to carry on to the sea, and here it aggrades its\r\nbed and builds a flood plain in order to gain a steeper gradient\r\nand velocity enough to transport its load.\r\n\r\nAs maturity is past and the relief of the land is lessened, a\r\nsmaller and smaller load of waste is delivered to the river. It\r\nnow has energy to spare and again degrades its valley, excavating\r\nits former flood plains and leaving them in terraces on either\r\nside, and at last in its old age sweeping them away.\r\n\r\nALLUVIAL CONES AND FANS. In hilly and mountainous countries one\r\noften sees on a valley side a conical or fan-shaped deposit of\r\nwaste at the mouth of a lateral stream. The cause is obvious: the\r\nyoung branch has not been able as yet to wear its bed to accordant\r\nlevel with the already deepened valley of the master stream. It\r\ntherefore builds its bed to grade at the point of juncture by\r\ndepositing here its load of waste,--a load too heavy to be carried\r\nalong the more gentle profile of the trunk valley.\r\n\r\nWhere rivers descend from a mountainous region upon the plain they\r\nmay build alluvial fans of exceedingly gentle slope. Thus the\r\nrivers of the western side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains have\r\nspread fans with a radius of as much as forty miles and a slope\r\ntoo slight to be detected without instruments, where they leave\r\nthe rock-cut canyons in the mountains and descend upon the broad\r\ncentral valley of California.\r\n\r\nAs a river flows over its fan it commonly divides into a\r\nbranchwork of shifting channels called DISTRIBUTARIES, since they\r\nlead off the water from the main stream. In this way each part of\r\nthe fan is aggraded and its symmetric form is preserved.\r\n\r\nPIEDMONT PLAINS. Mountain streams may build their confluent fans\r\ninto widespread piedmont (foot of the mountain) alluvial plains.\r\nThese are especially characteristic of arid lands, where the\r\nstreams wither as they flow out upon the thirsty lowlands and are\r\ntherefore compelled to lay down a large portion of their load. In\r\nhumid climates mountain-born streams are usually competent to\r\ncarry their loads of waste on to the sea, and have energy to spare\r\nto cut the lower mountain slopes into foothills. In arid regions\r\nfoothills are commonly absent and the ranges rise, as from\r\npedestals, above broad, sloping plains of stream-laid waste.\r\n\r\nTHE HIGH PLAINS. The rivers which flow eastward from the Rocky\r\nMountains have united their fans in a continuous sheet of waste\r\nwhich stretches forward from the base of the mountains for\r\nhundreds of miles and in places is five hundred feet thick (Fig.\r\n80). That the deposit was made in ancient times on land and not in\r\nthe sea is proved by the remains which it contains of land animals\r\nand plants of species now extinct. That it was laid by rivers and\r\nnot by fresh-water lakes is shown by its structure. Wide stretches\r\nof flat-lying, clays and sands are interrupted by long, narrow\r\nbelts of gravel which mark the channels of the ancient streams.\r\nGravels, and sands are often cross bedded, and their well worn\r\npebbles may be identified with the rocks of the mountains. After\r\nbuilding this sheet of waste the streams ceased to aggrade and\r\nbegan the work of destruction. Large uneroded remnants, their\r\nsurfaces flat as a floor, remain as the High Plains of western\r\nKansas and Nebraska.\r\n\r\nRIVER DEPOSITS IN SUBSIDING TROUGHS. To a geologist the most\r\nimportant river deposits are those which gather in areas of\r\ngradual subsidence; they are often of vast extent and immense\r\nthickness, and such deposits of past geological ages have not\r\ninfrequently been preserved, with all their records of the times\r\nin which they were built, by being carried below the level of the\r\nsea, to be brought to light by a later uplift. On the other hand,\r\nriver deposits which remain above baselevels of erosion are swept\r\naway comparatively soon.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA is a monotonously level plain of\r\ngreat fertility, four hundred miles in length and fifty miles in\r\naverage width, built of waste swept down by streams from the\r\nmountain ranges which inclose it,--the Sierra Nevada on the east\r\nand the Coast Range on the west. On the waste slopes at the foot\r\nof the bordering hills coarse gravels and even bowlders are left,\r\nwhile over the interior the slow-flowing streams at times of\r\nflood spread wide sheets of silt. Organic deposits are now forming\r\nby the decay of vegetation in swampy tule (reed) lands and in\r\nshallow lakes which occupy depressions left by the aggrading\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nDeep borings show that this great trough is filled to a depth of\r\nat least two thousand feet below sea level with recent\r\nunconsolidated sands and silts containing logs of wood and fresh-\r\nwater shells. These are land deposits, and the absence of any\r\nmarine deposits among them proves that the region has not been\r\ninvaded by the sea since the accumulation began. It has therefore\r\nbeen slowly subsiding and its streams, although continually\r\ncarried below grade, have yet been able to aggrade the surface as\r\nrapidly as the region sank, and have maintained it, as at present,\r\nslightly above sea level.\r\n\r\nTHE INDO-GANGETIC PLAIN, spread by the Brahmaputra, the Ganges,\r\nand the Indus river systems, stretches for sixteen hundred miles\r\nalong the southern base of the Himalaya Mountains and occupies an\r\narea of three hundred thousand square miles (Fig.342). It consists\r\nof the flood plains of the master streams and the confluent fans\r\nof the tributaries which issue from the mountains on the north.\r\nLarge areas are subject to overflow each season of flood, and\r\nstill larger tracts mark abandoned flood plains below which the\r\nrivers have now cut their beds. The plain is built of far-\r\nstretching beds of clay, penetrated by streaks of sand, and also\r\nof gravel near the mountains. Beds of impure peat occur in it, and\r\nit contains fresh-water shells and the bones of land animals of\r\nspecies now living in northern India. At Lucknow an artesian well\r\nwas sunk to one thousand feet below sea level without reaching the\r\nbottom of these river-laid sands and silts, proving a slow\r\nsubsidence with which the aggrading rivers have kept pace.\r\n\r\nWARPED VALLEYS. It is not necessary that an area should sink below\r\nsea level in order to be filled with stream-swept waste. High\r\nvalleys among growing mountain ranges may suffer warping, or may\r\nbe blockaded by rising mountain folds athwart them. Where the\r\ndeformation is rapid enough, the river may be ponded and the\r\nvalley filled with lake-laid sediments. Even when the river is\r\nable to maintain its right of way it may yet have its declivity so\r\nlessened that it is compelled to aggrade its course continually,\r\nfilling the valley with river deposits which may grow to an\r\nenormous thickness.\r\n\r\nBehind the outer ranges of the Himalaya Mountains lie several\r\nwaste-filled valleys, the largest of which are Kashmir and Nepal,\r\nthe former being an alluvial plain about as large as the state of\r\nDelaware. The rivers which drain these plains have already cut\r\ndown their outlet gorges sufficiently to begin the task of the\r\nremoval of the broad accumulations which they have brought in from\r\nthe surrounding mountains. Their present flood plains lie as much\r\nas some hundreds of feet below wide alluvial terraces which mark\r\ntheir former levels. Indeed, the horizontal beds of the Hundes\r\nValley have been trenched to the depth of nearly three thousand\r\nfeet by the Sutlej River. These deposits are recent or subrecent,\r\nfor there have been found at various levels the remains of land\r\nplants and land and fresh-water shells, and in some the bones of\r\nsuch animals as the hyena and the goat, of species or of genera\r\nnow living. Such soft deposits cannot be expected to endure\r\nthrough any considerable length of future time the rapid erosion\r\nto which their great height above the level of the sea will\r\nsubject them.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF RIVER DEPOSITS. The examples just cited teach\r\nclearly the characteristic features of extensive river deposits.\r\nThese deposits consist of broad, flat-lying sheets of clay and\r\nfine sand left by the overflow at time of flood, and traversed\r\nhere and there by long, narrow strips of coarse, cross-bedded\r\nsands and gravels thrown down by the swifter currents of the\r\nshifting channels. Occasional beds of muck mark the sites of\r\nshallow lakelets or fresh-water swamps. The various strata also\r\ncontain some remains of the countless myriads of animals and\r\nplants which live upon the surface of the plain as it is in\r\nprocess of building. River shells such as the mussel, land shells\r\nsuch as those of snails, the bones of fishes and of such land\r\nanimals as suffer drowning at times of flood or are mired in\r\nswampy places, logs of wood, and the stems and leaves of plants\r\nare examples of the variety of the remains of land and fresh-water\r\norganisms which are entombed in river deposits and sealed away as\r\na record of the life of the time, and as proof that the deposits\r\nwere laid by streams and not beneath the sea.\r\n\r\nBASIN DEPOSITS\r\n\r\nDEPOSITS IN DRY BASINS. On desert areas without outlet to the sea,\r\nas on the Great Basin of the United States and the deserts of\r\ncentral Asia, stream-swept waste accumulates indefinitely. The\r\nrivers of the surrounding mountains, fed by the rains and melting\r\nsnows of these comparatively moist elevations, dry and soak away\r\nas they come down upon the arid plains. They are compelled to lay\r\naside their entire load of waste eroded from the mountain valleys,\r\nin fans which grow to enormous size, reaching in some instances\r\nthousands of feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe monotonous levels of Turkestan include vast alluvial tracts\r\nnow in process of building by the floods of the frequently\r\nshifting channels of the Oxus and other rivers of the region. For\r\nabout seven hundred miles from its mouth in Aral Lake the Oxus\r\nreceives no tributaries, since even the larger branches of its\r\nsystem are lost in a network of distributaries and choked with\r\ndesert sands before they reach their master stream. These\r\naggrading rivers, which have channels but no valleys, spread their\r\nmuddy floods--which in the case of the Oxus sometimes equal the\r\naverage volume of the Mississippi--far and wide over the plain,\r\nwashing the bases of the desert dunes.\r\n\r\nPLAYAS. In arid interior basins the central depressions may be\r\noccupied by playas,--plains of fine mud washed forward from the\r\nmargins. In the wet season the playa is covered with a thin sheet\r\nof muddy water, a playa lake, supplied usually by some stream at\r\nflood. In the dry season the lake evaporates, the river which fed\r\nit retreats, and there is left to view a hard, smooth, level floor\r\nof sun-baked and sun-cracked yellow clay utterly devoid of\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nIn the Black Rock desert of Nevada a playa lake spreads over an\r\narea fifty miles long and twenty miles wide. In summer it\r\ndisappears; the Quinn River, which feeds it, shrinks back one\r\nhundred miles toward its source, leaving an absolutely barren\r\nfloor of clay, level as the sea.\r\n\r\nLAKE DEPOSITS. Regarding lakes as parts of river systems, we may\r\nnow notice the characteristic features of the deposits in lake\r\nbasins. Soundings in lakes of considerable size and depth show\r\nthat their bottoms are being covered with tine clays. Sand and\r\ngravel are found along; their margins, being brought in by streams\r\nand worn by waves from the shore, but there are no tidal or other\r\nstrong currents to sweep coarse waste out from shore to any\r\nconsiderable distance. Where fine clays are now found on the land\r\nin even, horizontal layers containing the remains of fresh-water\r\nanimals and plants, uncut by channels tilled with cross-bedded\r\ngravels and sands and bordered by beach deposits of coarse waste,\r\nwe may safely infer the existence of ancient lakes.\r\n\r\nMARL. Marl is a soft, whitish deposit of carbonate of lime,\r\nmingled often with more or less of clay, accumulated in small\r\nlakes whose feeding springs are charged with carbonate of lime and\r\ninto which little waste is washed from the land. Such lakelets are\r\nnot infrequent on the surface of the younger drift sheets of\r\nMichigan and northern Indiana, where their beds of marl--sometimes\r\nas much as forty feet thick--are utilized in the manufacture of\r\nPortland cement. The deposit results from the decay of certain\r\naquatic plants which secrete lime carbonate from the water, from\r\nthe decomposition of the calcareous shells of tiny mollusks which\r\nlive in countless numbers on the lake floor, and in some cases\r\napparently from chemical precipitation.\r\n\r\nPEAT. We have seen how lakelets are extinguished by the decaying\r\nremains of the vegetation which they support. A section of such a\r\nfossil lake shows that below the growing mosses and other plants\r\nof the surface of the bog lies a spongy mass composed of dead\r\nvegetable tissue, which passes downward gradually into PEAT,--a\r\ndense, dark brown carbonaceous deposit in which, to the unaided\r\neye, little or no trace of vegetable structure remains. When\r\ndried, peat forms a fuel of some value and is used either cut into\r\nslabs and dried or pressed into bricks by machinery.\r\n\r\nWhen vegetation decays in open air the carbon of its tissues,\r\ntaken from the atmosphere by the leaves, is oxidized and returned\r\nto it in its original form of carbon dioxide. But decomposing in\r\nthe presence of water, as in a bog, where the oxygen of the air is\r\nexcluded, the carbonaceous matter of plants accumulates in\r\ndeposits of peat.\r\n\r\nPeat bogs are numerous in regions lately abandoned by glacier ice,\r\nwhere river systems are so immature that the initial depressions\r\nleft in the sheet of drift spread over the country have not yet\r\nbeen drained. One tenth of the surface of Ireland is said to be\r\ncovered with peat, and small bogs abound in the drift-covered area\r\nof New England and the states lying as far west as the Missouri\r\nRiver. In Massachusetts alone it has been reckoned that there are\r\nfifteen billion cubic feet of peat, the largest bog occupying\r\nseveral thousand acres.\r\n\r\nMuch larger swamps occur on the young coastal plain of the\r\nAtlantic from New Jersey to Florida. The Dismal Swamp, for\r\nexample, in Virginia and North Carolina is forty miles across. It\r\nis covered with a dense growth of water-loving trees such as the\r\ncypress and black gum. The center of the swamp is occupied by Lake\r\nDrummond, a shallow lake seven miles in diameter, with banks of\r\npure-peat, and still narrowing from the encroachment of vegetation\r\nalong its borders.\r\n\r\nSALT LAKES. In arid climates a lake rarely receives sufficient\r\ninflow to enable it to rise to the basin rim and find an outlet.\r\nBefore this height is reached its surface becomes large enough to\r\ndischarge by evaporation into the dry air the amount of water that\r\nis supplied by streams. As such a lake has no outlet, the minerals\r\nin solution brought into it by its streams cannot escape from the\r\nbasin. The lake water becomes more and more heavily charged with\r\nsuch substances as common salt and the sulphates and carbonates of\r\nlime, of soda, and of potash, and these are thrown down from\r\nsolution one after another as the point of saturation for each\r\nmineral is reached. Carbonate of lime, the least soluble and often\r\nthe most abundant mineral brought in, is the first to be\r\nprecipitated. As concentration goes on, gypsum, which is insoluble\r\nin a strong brine, is deposited, and afterwards common salt. As\r\nthe saltness of the lake varies with the seasons and with climatic\r\nchanges, gypsum and salt are laid in alternate beds and are\r\ninterleaved with sedimentary clays spread from the waste brought\r\nin by streams at times of flood. Few forms of life can live in\r\nbodies of salt water so concentrated that chemical deposits take\r\nplace, and hence the beds of salt, gypsum, and silt of such lakes\r\nare quite barren of the remains of life. Similar deposits are\r\nprecipitated by the concentration of sea water in lagoons and arms\r\nof the sea cut off from the ocean.\r\n\r\nLAKES BONNEVILLE AND LAHONTAN. These names are given to extinct\r\nlakes which once occupied large areas in the Great Basin, the\r\nformer in Utah, the latter in northwestern Nevada. Their records\r\nremain in old horizontal beach lines which they drew along their\r\nmountainous shores at the different levels at which they stood,\r\nand in the deposits of their beds. At its highest stage Lake\r\nBonneville, then one thousand feet deep, overflowed to the north\r\nand was a fresh-water lake. As it shrank below the outlet it\r\nbecame more and more salty, and the Great Salt Lake, its withered\r\nresidue, is now depositing salt along its shores. In its strong\r\nbrine lime carbonate is insoluble, and that brought in by streams\r\nis thrown down at once in the form of travertine.\r\n\r\nLake Lahontan never had an outlet. The first chemical deposits to\r\nbe made along its shores were deposits of travertine, in places\r\neighty feet thick. Its floor is spread with fine clays, which must\r\nhave been laid in deep, still water, and which are charged with\r\nthe salts absorbed by them as the briny water of the lake dried\r\naway. These sedimentary clays are in two divisions, the upper and\r\nlower, each being about one hundred feet thick. They are separated\r\nby heavy deposits of well-rounded, cross-bedded gravels and sands,\r\nsimilar to those spread at the present time by the intermittent\r\nstreams of arid regions. A similar record is shown in the old\r\nfloors of Lake Bonneville. What conclusions do you draw from these\r\nfacts as to the history of these ancient lakes?\r\n\r\nDELTAS\r\n\r\nIn the river deposits which are left above sea level particles of\r\nwaste are allowed to linger only for a time. From alluvial fans\r\nand flood plains they are constantly being taken up and swept\r\nfarther on downstream. Although these land forms may long persist,\r\nthe particles which compose them are ever changing. We may\r\ntherefore think of the alluvial deposits of a valley as a stream\r\nof waste fed by the waste mantle as it creeps and washes down the\r\nvalley sides, and slowly moving onwards to the sea.\r\n\r\nIn basins waste finds a longer rest, but sooner or later lakes and\r\ndry basins are drained or filled, and their deposits, if above sea\r\nlevel, resume their journey to their final goal. It is only when\r\ncarried below the level of the sea that they are indefinitely\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nOn reaching this terminus, rivers deliver their load to the ocean.\r\nIn some cases the ocean is able to take it up by means of strong\r\ntidal and other currents, and to dispose of it in ways which we\r\nshall study later. But often the load is so large, or the tides\r\nare so weak, that much of the waste which the river brings in\r\nsettles at its mouth, there building up a deposit called the\r\nDELTA, from the Greek letter of that name, whose shape it\r\nsometimes resembles.\r\n\r\nDeltas and alluvial fans have many common characteristics. Both\r\nowe their origin to a sudden check in the velocity of the river,\r\ncompelling a deposit of the load; both are triangular in outline,\r\nthe apex pointing upstream; and both are traversed by\r\ndistributaries which build up all parts in turn.\r\n\r\nIn a delta we may distinguish deposits of two distinct kinds,--\r\nthe submarine and the subaerial. In part a delta is built of waste\r\nbrought down by the river and redistributed and spread by waves\r\nand tides over the sea bottom adjacent to the river's mouth. The\r\norigin of these deposits is recorded in the remains of marine\r\nanimals and plants which they contain.\r\n\r\nAs the submarine delta grows near to the level of the sea the\r\ndistributaries of the river cover it with subaerial deposits\r\naltogether similar to those of the flood plain, of which indeed\r\nthe subaerial delta is the prolongation. Here extended deposits of\r\npeat may accumulate in swamps, and the remains of land and fresh-\r\nwater animals and plants swept down by the stream are imbedded in\r\nthe silts laid at times of flood.\r\n\r\nBorings made in the deltas of great rivers such as the\r\nMississippi, the Ganges, and the Nile, show that the subaerial\r\nportion often reaches a surprising thickness. Layers of peat, old\r\nsoils, and forest grounds with the stumps of trees are discovered\r\nhundreds of feet below sea level. In the Nile delta some eight\r\nlayers of coarse gravel were found interbedded with river silts,\r\nand in the Ganges delta at Calcutta a boring nearly five hundred\r\nfeet in depth stopped in such a layer.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi has built a delta of twelve thousand three hundred\r\nsquare miles, and is pushing the natural embankments of its chief\r\ndistributaries into the Gulf at a maximum rate of a mile in\r\nsixteen years. Muddy shoals surround its front, shallow lakes,\r\ne.g. lakes Pontchartrain and Borgne, are formed between the\r\ngrowing delta and the old shore line, and elongate lakes and\r\nswamps are inclosed between the natural embankments of the\r\ndistributaries.\r\n\r\nThe delta of the Indus River, India, lies so low along shore that\r\na broad tract of country is overflowed by the highest tides. The\r\nsubmarine portion of the delta has been built to near sea level\r\nover so wide a belt offshore that in many places large vessels\r\ncannot come even within sight of land because of the shallow\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nA former arm of the sea, the Rann of Cutch, adjoining the delta on\r\nthe east has been silted up and is now an immense barren flat of\r\nsandy mud two hundred miles in length and one hundred miles in\r\ngreatest breadth. Each summer it is flooded with salt water when\r\nthe sea is brought in by strong southwesterly monsoon winds, and\r\nthe climate during the remainder of the year is hot and dry. By\r\nthe evaporation of sea water the soil is thus left so salty that\r\nno vegetation can grow upon it, and in places beds of salt several\r\nfeet in thickness have accumulated. Under like conditions salt\r\nbeds of great thickness have been formed in the past and are now\r\nfound buried among the deposits of ancient deltas.\r\n\r\nSUBSIDENCE OF GREAT DELTAS. As a rule great deltas are slowly\r\nsinking. In some instances upbuilding by river deposits has gone\r\non as rapidly as the region has subsided. The entire thickness of\r\nthe Ganges delta, for example, so far as it has been sounded,\r\nconsists of deposits laid in open air. In other cases interbedded\r\nlimestones and other sedimentary rocks containing marine fossils\r\nprove that at times subsidence has gained on the upbuilding and\r\nthe delta has been covered with the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is by gradual depression that delta deposits attain enormous\r\nthickness, and, being lowered beneath the level of the sea, are\r\nsafely preserved from erosion until a movement of the earth's\r\ncrust in the opposite direction lifts them to form part of the\r\nland. We shall read later in the hard rocks of our continent the\r\nrecords of such ancient deltas, and we shall not be surprised to\r\nfind them as thick as are those now building at the mouths of\r\ngreat rivers.\r\n\r\nLAKE DELTAS. Deltas are also formed where streams lose their\r\nvelocity on entering the still waters of lakes. The shore lines of\r\nextinct lakes, such as Lake Agassiz and Lakes Bonneville and\r\nLahontan, may be traced by the heavy deposits at the mouths of\r\ntheir tributary streams.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the work of streams is to drain the lands of the\r\nwater poured upon them by the rainfall, to wear them down, and to\r\ncarry their waste away to the sea, there to be rebuilt by other\r\nagents into sedimentary rocks. The ancient strata of which the\r\ncontinents are largely made are composed chiefly of material thus\r\nworn from still more ancient lands--lands with their hills and\r\nvalleys like those of to-day--and carried by their rivers to the\r\nocean. In all geological times, as at the present, the work of\r\nstreams has been to destroy the lands, and in so doing to furnish\r\nto the ocean the materials from which the lands of future ages\r\nwere to be made. Before we consider how the waste of the land\r\nbrought in by streams is rebuilt upon the ocean floor, we must\r\nproceed to study the work of two agents, glacier ice and the wind,\r\nwhich cooperate with rivers in the denudation of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF GLACIERS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DRIFT. The surface of northeastern North America, as far south\r\nas the Ohio and Missouri rivers, is generally covered by the\r\ndrift,--a formation which is quite unlike any which we have so far\r\nstudied. A section of it, such as that illustrated in Figure 87,\r\nshows that for the most part it is unstratified, consisting of\r\nclay, sand, pebbles, and even large bowlders, all mingled pell-\r\nmell together. The agent which laid the drift is one which can\r\ncarry a load of material of all sizes, from the largest bowlder to\r\nthe finest clay, and deposit it without sorting.\r\n\r\nThe stones of the drift are of many kinds. The region from which\r\nit was gathered may well have been large in order to supply these\r\nmany different varieties of rocks. Pebbles and bowlders have been\r\nleft far from their original homes, as may be seen in southern\r\nIowa, where the drift contains nuggets of copper brought from the\r\nregion about Lake Superior. The agent which laid the drift is one\r\nable to gather its load over a large area and carry it a long way.\r\n\r\nThe pebbles of the drift are unlike those rounded by running water\r\nor by waves. They are marked with scratches. Some are angular,\r\nmany have had their edges blunted, while others have been ground\r\nflat and smooth on one or more sides, like gems which have been\r\nfaceted by being held firmly against the lapidary's wheel. In many\r\nplaces the upper surface of the country rock beneath the drift has\r\nbeen swept clean of residual clays and other waste. All rock\r\nrotten has been planed away, and the ledges of sound rock to which\r\nthe surface has been cut down have been rubbed smooth and\r\nscratched with long, straight, parallel lines. The agent which\r\nlaid the drift can hold sand and pebbles firmly in its grasp and\r\ncan grind them against the rock beneath, thus planing it down and\r\nscoring it, while faceting the pebbles also.\r\n\r\nNeither water nor wind can do these things. Indeed, nothing like\r\nthe drift is being formed by any process now at work anywhere in\r\nthe eastern United States. To find the agent which has laid this\r\nextensive formation we must go to a region of different climatic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nTHE INLAND ICE OF GREENLAND. Greenland is about fifteen hundred\r\nmiles long and nearly seven hundred miles in greatest width. With\r\nthe exception of a narrow fringe of mountainous coast land, it is\r\ncompletely buried beneath a sheet of ice, in shape like a vast\r\nwhite shield, whose convex surface rises to a height of nine\r\nthousand feet above the sea. The few explorers who have crossed\r\nthe ice cap found it a trackless desert destitute of all life save\r\nsuch lowly forms as the microscopic plant which produces the so-\r\ncalled \"red snow.\" On the smooth plain of the interior no rock\r\nwaste relieves the snow's dazzling whiteness; no streams of\r\nrunning water are seen; the silence is broken only by howling\r\nstorm winds and the rustle of the surface snow which they drive\r\nbefore them. Sounding with long poles, explorers find that below\r\nthe powdery snow of the latest snowfall lie successive layers of\r\nearlier snows, which grow more and more compact downward, and at\r\nlast have altered to impenetrable ice. The ice cap formed by the\r\naccumulated snows of uncounted centuries may well be more than a\r\nmile in depth. Ice thus formed by the compacting of snow is\r\ndistinguished when in motion as GLACIER ICE.\r\n\r\nThe inland ice of Greenland moves. It flows with imperceptible\r\nslowness under its own weight, like, a mass of some viscous or\r\nplastic substance, such as pitch or molasses candy, in all\r\ndirections outward toward the sea. Near the edge it has so thinned\r\nthat mountain peaks are laid bare, these islands in the sea of ice\r\nbeing known as NUNATAKS. Down the valleys of the coastal belt it\r\ndrains in separate streams of ice, or GLACIERS. The largest of\r\nthese reach the sea at the head of inlets, and are therefore\r\ncalled TIDE GLACIERS. Their fronts stand so deep in sea water that\r\nthere is visible seldom more than three hundred feet of the wall\r\nof ice, which in many glaciers must be two thousand and more feet\r\nhigh. From the sea walls of tide glaciers great fragments break\r\noff and float away as icebergs. Thus snows which fell in the\r\ninterior of this northern land, perhaps many thousands of years\r\nago, are carried in the form of icebergs to melt at last in the\r\nNorth Atlantic.\r\n\r\nGreenland, then, is being modeled over the vast extent of its\r\ninterior not by streams of running water, as are regions in warm\r\nand humid climates, nor by currents of air, as are deserts to a\r\nlarge extent, but by a sheet of flowing ice. What the ice sheet is\r\ndoing in the interior we may infer from a study of the separate\r\nglaciers into which it breaks at its edge.\r\n\r\nTHE SMALLER GREENLAND GLACIERS. Many of the smaller glaciers of\r\nGreenland do not reach the sea, but deploy on plains of sand and\r\ngravel. The edges of these ice tongues are often as abrupt as if\r\nsliced away with a knife (Fig. 92), and their structure is thus\r\nreadily seen. They are stratified, their layers representing in\r\npart the successive snowfalls of the interior of the country. The\r\nupper layers are commonly white and free from stones; but the\r\nlower layers, to the height of a hundred feet or more, are dark\r\nwith debris which is being slowly carried on. So thickly studded\r\nwith stones is the base of the ice that it is sometimes difficult\r\nto distinguish it from the rock waste which has been slowly\r\ndragged beneath the glacier or left about its edges. The waste\r\nbeneath and about the glacier is unsorted. The stones are of many\r\nkinds, and numbers of them have been ground to flat faces. Where\r\nthe front of the ice has retreated the rock surface is seen to be\r\nplaned and scored in places by the stones frozen fast in the sole\r\nof the glacier.\r\n\r\nWe have now found in glacier ice an agent able to produce the\r\ndrift of North America. The ice sheet of Greenland is now doing\r\nwhat we have seen was done in the recent past in our own land. It\r\nis carrying for long distances rocks of many kinds gathered, we\r\nmay infer, over a large extent of country. It is laying down its\r\nload without assortment in unstratified deposits. It grinds down\r\nand scores the rock over which it moves, and in the process many\r\nof the pebbles of its load are themselves also ground smooth and\r\nscratched. Since this work can be done by no other agent, we must\r\nconclude that the northeastern part of our own continent was\r\ncovered in the recent past by glacier ice, as Greenland is to-day.\r\n\r\nVALLEY GLACIERS\r\n\r\nThe work of glacier ice can be most conveniently studied in the\r\nseparate ice streams which creep down mountain valleys in many\r\nregions such as Alaska, the western mountains of the United States\r\nand Canada, the Himalayas, and the Alps. As the glaciers of the\r\nAlps have been studied longer and more thoroughly than any others,\r\nwe shall describe them in some detail as examples of valley\r\nglaciers in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS OF GLACIER FORMATION. The condition of the great\r\naccumulation of snow to which glaciers are due--that more or less\r\nof each winter's snow should be left over unmelted and\r\nunevaporated to the next--is fully met in the Alps. There is\r\nabundant moisture brought by the winds from neighboring seas. The\r\ncurrents of moist air driven up the mountain slopes are cooled by\r\ntheir own expansion as they rise, and the moisture which they\r\ncontain is condensed at a temperature at or below 32 degrees F.,\r\nand therefore is precipitated in the form of snow. The summers are\r\ncool and their heat does not suffice to completely melt the heavy\r\nsnow of the preceding winter. On the Alps the SNOW LINE--the lower\r\nlimit of permanent snow--is drawn at about eight thousand five\r\nhundred feet above sea level. Above the snow line on the slopes\r\nand crests, where these are not too steep, the snow lies the year\r\nround and gathers in valley heads to a depth of hundreds of feet.\r\n\r\nThis is but a small fraction of the thickness to which snow would\r\nbe piled on the Alps were it not constantly being drained away.\r\nBelow the snow fields which mantle the heights the mountain\r\nvalleys are occupied by glaciers which extend as much as a\r\nvertical mile below the snow line. The presence in the midst of\r\nforests and meadows and cultivated fields of these tongues of ice,\r\never melting and yet from year to year losing none of their bulk,\r\nproves that their loss is made good in the only possible way. They\r\nare fed by snow fields above, whose surplus of snow they drain\r\naway in the form of ice. The presence of glaciers below the snow\r\nline is a clear proof that, rigid and motionless as they appear,\r\nglaciers really are in constant motion down valley.\r\n\r\nTHE NEVE FIELD. The head of an Alpine valley occupied by a glacier\r\nis commonly a broad amphitheater deeply filled with snow. Great\r\npeaks tower above it, and snowy slopes rise on either side on the\r\nflanks of mountain spurs. From these heights fierce winds drift\r\nthe snows into the amphitheater, and avalanches pour in their\r\ntorrents of snow and waste. The snow of the amphitheater is like\r\nthat of drifts in late winter after many successive thaws and\r\nfreezings. It is made of hard grains and pellets and is called\r\nNEVE. Beneath the surface of the neve field and at its outlet the\r\ngranular neve has been compacted to a mass of porous crystalline\r\nice. Snow has been changed to neve, and neve to glacial ice, both\r\nby pressure, which drives the air from the interspaces of the\r\nsnowflakes, and also by successive meltings and freezings, much as\r\na snowball is packed in the warm hand and becomes frozen to a ball\r\nof ice.\r\n\r\nTHE BERGSCHRUND. The neve is in slow motion. It breaks itself\r\nloose from the thinner snows about it, too shallow to share its\r\nmotion, and from the rock rim which surrounds it, forming a deep\r\nfissure called the bergschrund, sometimes a score and more feet\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nSIZE OF GLACIERS. The ice streams of the Alps vary in size\r\naccording to the amount of precipitation and the area of the neve\r\nfields which they drain. The largest of Alpine glaciers, the\r\nAletsch, is nearly ten miles long and has an average width of\r\nabout a mile. The thickness of some of the glaciers of the Alps is\r\nas much as a thousand feet. Giant glaciers more than twice the\r\nlength of the longest in the Alps occur on the south slope of the\r\nHimalaya Mountains, which receive frequent precipitations of snow\r\nfrom moist winds from the Indian Ocean. The best known of the many\r\nimmense glaciers of Alaska, the Muir, has an area of about eight\r\nhundred square miles (Fig. 95).\r\n\r\nGLACIER MOTION. The motion of the glaciers of the Alps seldom\r\nexceeds one or two feet a day. Large glaciers, because of the\r\nenormous pressure of their weight and because of less marginal\r\nresistance, move faster than small ones. The Muir advances at the\r\nrate of seven feet a day, and some of the larger tide glaciers of\r\nGreenland are reported to move at the exceptional rate of fifty\r\nfeet and more in the same time. Glaciers move faster by day than\r\nby night, and in summer than in winter. Other laws of glacier\r\nmotion may be discovered by a study of Figures 96 and 97. It is\r\nimportant to remember that glaciers do not slide bodily over their\r\nbeds, but urged by gravity move slowly down valley in somewhat the\r\nsame way as would a stream of thick mud. Although small pieces of\r\nice are brittle, the large mass of granular ice which composes a\r\nglacier acts as a viscous substance.\r\n\r\nCREVASSES. Slight changes of slope in the glacier bed, and the\r\ndifferent rates of motion in different parts, produce tensions\r\nunder which the ice cracks and opens in great fissures called\r\ncrevasses. At an abrupt descent in the bed the ice is shattered\r\ninto great fragments, which unite again below the icefall.\r\nCrevasses are opened on lines at right angles to the direction of\r\nthe tension. TRANSVERSE CREVASSES are due to a convexity in the\r\nbed which stretches the ice lengthwise (Fig. 99). MARGINAL\r\nCREVASSES are directed upstream and inwards; RADIAL CREVASSES are\r\nfound where the ice stream deploys from some narrow valley and\r\nspreads upon some more open space. What is the direction of the\r\ntension which causes each and to what is it due?\r\n\r\nLATERAL AND MEDIAL MORAINES. The surface of a glacier is striped\r\nlengthwise by long dark bands of rock debris. Those in the center\r\nare called the medial moraines. The one on either margin is a\r\nlateral moraine, and is clearly formed of waste which has fallen\r\non the edge of the ice from the valley slopes. A medial moraine\r\ncannot be formed in this way, since no rock fragments can fall so\r\nfar out from the sides. But following it up the glacial stream,\r\none finds that a medial moraine takes its beginning at the\r\njunction of the glacier and some tributary and is formed by the\r\nunion of their two adjacent lateral moraines. Each branch thus\r\nadds a medial moraine, and by counting the number of medial\r\nmoraines of a trunk stream one may learn of how many branches it\r\nis composed.\r\n\r\nSurface moraines appear in the lower course of the glacier as\r\nridges, which may reach the exceptional height of one hundred\r\nfeet. The bulk of such a ridge is ice. It has been protected from\r\nthe sun by the veneer of moraine stuff; while the glacier surface\r\non either side has melted down at least the distance of the height\r\nof the ridge. In summer the lowering of the glacial surface by\r\nmelting goes on rapidly. In Swiss glaciers it has been estimated\r\nthat the average lowering of the surface by melting and\r\nevaporation amounts to ten feet a year. As a moraine ridge grows\r\nhigher and more steep by the lowering of the surface of the\r\nsurrounding ice, the stones of its cover tend to slip down its\r\nsides. Thus moraines broaden, until near the terminus of a glacier\r\nthey may coalesce in a wide field of stony waste.\r\n\r\nENGLACIAL DRIFT. This name is applied to whatever debris is\r\ncarried within the glacier. It consists of rock waste fallen on\r\nthe neve and there buried by accumulations of snow, and of that\r\nengulfed in the glacier where crevasses have opened beneath a\r\nsurface moraine. As the surface of the glacier is lowered by\r\nmelting, more or less englacial drift is brought again to open\r\nair, and near the terminus it may help to bury the ice from view\r\nbeneath a sheet of debris.\r\n\r\nTHE GROUND MORAINE. The drift dragged along at the glacier's base\r\nand lodged beneath it is known as the ground moraine. Part of the\r\nmaterial of it has fallen down deep crevasses and part has been\r\ntorn and worn from the glacier's bed and banks. While the stones\r\nof the surface moraines remain as angular as when they lodged on\r\nthe ice, many of those of the ground moraine have been blunted on\r\nthe edges and faceted and scratched by being ground against one\r\nanother and the rocky bed.\r\n\r\nIn glaciers such as those of Greenland, whose basal layers are\r\nwell loaded with drift and whose surface layers are nearly clean,\r\ndifferent layers have different rates of motion, according to the\r\namount of drift with which they are clogged. One layer glides over\r\nanother, and the stones inset in each are ground and smoothed and\r\nscratched. Usually the sides of glaciated pebbles are more worn\r\nthan the ends, and the scratches upon them run with the longer\r\naxis of the stone. Why?\r\n\r\nTHE TERMINAL MORAINE. As a glacier is in constant motion, it\r\nbrings to its end all of its load except such parts of the ground\r\nmoraine as may find permanent lodgment beneath the ice. Where the\r\nglacier front remains for some time at one place, there is formed\r\nan accumulation of drift known as the terminal moraine. In valley\r\nglaciers it is shaped by the ice front to a crescent whose convex\r\nside is downstream. Some of the pebbles of the terminal moraine\r\nare angular, and some are faceted and scored, the latter having\r\ncome by the hard road of the ground moraine. The material of the\r\ndump is for the most part unsorted, though the water of the\r\nmelting ice may find opportunity to leave patches of stratified\r\nsands and gravels in the midst of the unstratified mass of drift,\r\nand the finer material is in places washed away.\r\n\r\nGLACIER DRAINAGE. The terminal moraine is commonly breached by a\r\nconsiderable stream, which issues from beneath the ice by a tunnel\r\nwhose portal has been enlarged to a beautiful archway by melting\r\nin the sun and the warm air (Fig. 107). The stream is gray with\r\nsilt and loaded with sand and gravel washed from the ground\r\nmoraine. \"Glacier milk\" the Swiss call this muddy water, the gray\r\ncolor of whose silt proves it rock flour freshly ground by the ice\r\nfrom the unoxidized sound rock of its bed, the mud of streams\r\nbeing yellowish when it is washed from the oxidized mantle of\r\nwaste. Since glacial streams are well loaded with waste due to\r\nvigorous ice erosion, the valley in front of the glacier is\r\ncommonly aggraded to a broad, flat floor. These outwash deposits\r\nare known as VALLEY DRIFT.\r\n\r\nThe sand brought out by streams from beneath a glacier differs\r\nfrom river sand in that it consists of freshly broken angular\r\ngrains. Why?\r\n\r\nThe stream derives its water chiefly from the surface melting of\r\nthe glacier. As the ice is touched by the rays of the morning sun\r\nin summer, water gathers in pools, and rills trickle and unite in\r\nbrooklets which melt and cut shallow channels in the blue ice. The\r\ncourse of these streams is short. Soon they plunge into deep wells\r\ncut by their whirling waters where some crevasse has begun to open\r\nacross their path. These wells lead into chambers and tunnels by\r\nwhich sooner or later their waters find way to the rock floor of\r\nthe valley and there unite in a subglacial stream.\r\n\r\nTHE LOWER LIMIT OF GLACIERS. The glaciers of a region do not by\r\nany means end at a uniform height above sea level. Each terminates\r\nwhere its supply is balanced by melting. Those therefore which are\r\nfed by the largest and deepest neves and those also which are best\r\nprotected from the sun by a northward exposure or by the depth of\r\ntheir inclosing valleys flow to lower levels than those whose\r\nsupply is less and whose exposure to the sun is greater.\r\n\r\nA series of cold, moist years, with an abundant snowfall, causes\r\nglaciers to thicken and advance; a series of warm, dry years\r\ncauses them to wither and melt back. The variation in glaciers is\r\nnow carefully observed in many parts of the world. The Muir\r\nglacier has retreated two miles in twenty years. The glaciers of\r\nthe Swiss Alps are now for the most part melting back, although a\r\nwell-known glacier of the eastern Alps, the Vernagt, advanced five\r\nhundred feet in the year 1900, and was then plowing up its\r\nterminal moraine.\r\n\r\nHow soon would you expect a glacier to advance after its neve\r\nfields have been swollen with unusually heavy snows, as compared\r\nwith the time needed for the flood of a large river to reach its\r\nmouth after heavy rains upon its headwaters?\r\n\r\nOn the surface of glaciers in summer time one may often see large\r\nstones supported by pillars of ice several feet in height (Fig.\r\n108). These \"glacier tables\" commonly slope more or less strongly\r\nto the south, and thus may be used to indicate roughly the points\r\nof the compass. Can you explain their formation and the direction\r\nof their slope? On the other hand, a small and thin stone, or a\r\npatch of dust, lying on the ice, tends to sink a few inches into\r\nit. Why?\r\n\r\nIn what respects is a valley glacier like a mountain stream which\r\nflows out upon desert plains?\r\n\r\nTwo confluent glaciers do not mingle their currents as do two\r\nconfluent rivers. What characteristics of surface moraines prove\r\nthis fact?\r\n\r\nWhat effect would you expect the laws of glacier motion to have on\r\nthe slant of the sides of transverse crevasses?\r\n\r\nA trunk glacier has four medial moraines. Of how many tributaries\r\nis it composed? Illustrate by diagram.\r\n\r\nState all the evidences which you have found that glaciers move.\r\n\r\nIf a glacier melts back with occasional pauses up a valley, what\r\nrecords are left of its retreat?\r\n\r\nPIEDMONT GLACIERS\r\n\r\nTHE MALASPINA GLACIER. Piedmont (foot of the mountain) glaciers\r\nare, as the name implies, ice fields formed at the foot of\r\nmountains by the confluence of valley glaciers. The Malaspina\r\nglacier of Alaska, the typical glacier of this kind, is seventy\r\nmiles wide and stretches for thirty miles from the foot of the\r\nMount Saint Elias range to the shore of the Pacific Ocean. The\r\nvalley glaciers which unite and spread to form this lake of ice\r\nlie above the snow line and their moraines are concealed beneath\r\nneve. The central area of the Malaspina is also free from debris;\r\nbut on the outer edge large quantities of englacial drift are\r\nexposed by surface melting and form a belt of morainic waste a few\r\nfeet thick and several miles wide, covered in part with a\r\nluxuriant forest, beneath which the ice is in places one thousand\r\nfeet in depth. The glacier here is practically stagnant, and lakes\r\na few hundred yards across, which could not exist were the ice in\r\nmotion and broken with crevasses, gather on their beds sorted\r\nwaste from the moraine. The streams which drain the glacier have\r\ncut their courses in englacial and subglacial tunnels; none flow\r\nfor any distance on the surface. The largest, the Yahtse River,\r\nissues from a high archway in the ice,--a muddy torrent one\r\nhundred feet wide and twenty feet deep, loaded with sand and\r\nstones which it deposits in a broad outwash plain (Fig. 110).\r\nWhere the ice has retreated from the sea there is left a hummocky\r\ndrift sheet with hollows filled with lakelets. These deposits help\r\nto explain similar hummocky regions of drift and similar plains of\r\ncoarse, water-laid material often found in the drift-covered area\r\nof the northeastern United States.\r\n\r\nTHE GEOLOGICAL WORK OF GLACIER ICE\r\n\r\nThe sluggish glacier must do its work in a different way from the\r\nagile river. The mountain stream is swift and small, and its\r\nchannel occupies but a small portion of the valley. The glacier is\r\nslow and big; its rate of motion may be less than a millionth of\r\nthat of running water over the same declivity, and its bulk is\r\nproportionately large and fills the valley to great depth.\r\nMoreover, glacier ice is a solid body plastic under slowly applied\r\nstresses, while the water of rivers is a nimble fluid.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION. Valley glaciers differ from rivers as carriers in\r\nthat they float the major part of their load upon their surface,\r\ntransporting the heaviest bowlder as easily as a grain of sand;\r\nwhile streams push and roll much of their load along their beds,\r\nand their power of transporting waste depends solely upon their\r\nvelocity. The amount of the surface load of glaciers is limited\r\nonly by the amount of waste received from the mountain slopes\r\nabove them. The moving floor of ice stretched high across a valley\r\nsweeps along as lateral moraines much of the waste which a\r\nmountain stream would let accumulate in talus and alluvial cones.\r\n\r\nWhile a valley glacier carries much of its load on top, an ice\r\nsheet, such as that of Greenland, is free from surface debris,\r\nexcept where moraines trail away from some nunatak. If at its edge\r\nit breaks into separate glaciers which drain down mountain\r\nvalleys, these tongues of ice will carry the selvages of waste\r\ncommon to valley glaciers. Both ice sheets and valley glaciers\r\ndrag on large quantities of rock waste in their ground moraines.\r\n\r\nStones transported by glaciers are sometimes called erratics. Such\r\nare the bowlders of the drift of our northern states. Erratics may\r\nbe set down in an insecure position on the melting of the ice.\r\n\r\nDEPOSIT. Little need be added here to what has already been said\r\nof ground and terminal moraines. All strictly glacial deposits are\r\nunstratified. The load laid down at the end of a glacier in the\r\nterminal moraine is loose in texture, while the drift lodged\r\nbeneath the glacier as ground moraine is often an extremely dense,\r\nstony clay, having been compacted under the pressure of the\r\noverriding ice.\r\n\r\nEROSION. A glacier erodes its bed and banks in two ways,--by\r\nabrasion and by plucking.\r\n\r\nThe rock bed over which a glacier has moved is seen in places to\r\nhave been abraded, or ground away, to smooth surfaces which are\r\nmarked by long, straight, parallel scorings aligned with the line\r\nof movement of the ice and varying in size from hair lines and\r\ncoarse scratches to exceptional furrows several feet deep. Clearly\r\nthis work has been accomplished by means of the sharp sand, the\r\npebbles, and the larger stones with which the base of the glacier\r\nis inset, and which it holds in a firm grasp as running water\r\ncannot. Hard and fine-grained rocks, such as granite and\r\nquartzite, are often not only ground down to a smooth surface but\r\nare also highly polished by means of fine rock flour worn from the\r\nglacier bed.\r\n\r\nIn other places the bed of the glacier is rough and torn. The\r\nrocks have been disrupted and their fragments have been carried\r\naway,--a process known as PLUCKING. Moving under immense pressure\r\nthe ice shatters the rock, breaks off projections, presses into\r\ncrevices and wedges the rocks apart, dislodges the blocks into\r\nwhich the rock is divided by joints and bedding planes, and\r\nfreezing fast to the fragments drags them on. In this work the\r\nfreezing and thawing of subglacial waters in any cracks and\r\ncrevices of the rock no doubt play an important part. Plucking\r\noccurs especially where the bed rock is weak because of close\r\njointing. The product of plucking is bowlders, while the product\r\nof abrasion is fine rock flour and sand.\r\n\r\nIs the ground moraine of Figure 87 due chiefly to abrasion or to\r\nplucking?\r\n\r\nROCHES MOUTONNEES AND ROUNDED HILLS. The prominences left between\r\nthe hollows due to plucking are commonly ground down and rounded\r\non the stoss side,--the side from which the ice advances,--and\r\nsometimes on the opposite, the lee side, as well. In this way the\r\nbed rock often comes to have a billowy surface known as roches\r\nmoutonnees (sheep rocks). Hills overridden by an ice sheet often\r\nhave similarly rounded contours on the stoss side, while on the\r\nlee side they may be craggy, either because of plucking or because\r\nhere they have been less worn from their initial profile.\r\n\r\nTHE DIRECTION OF GLACIER MOVEMENT. The direction of the flow of\r\nvanished glaciers and ice sheets is recorded both in the\r\ndifferences just mentioned in the profiles of overridden hills and\r\nalso in the minute details of the glacier trail.\r\n\r\nFlint nodules or other small prominences in the bed rock are found\r\nmore worn on the stoss than on the lee side, where indeed they may\r\nhave a low cone of rock protected by them from abrasion. Cavities,\r\non the other hand, have their edges worn on the lee side and left\r\nsharp upon the stoss.\r\n\r\nSurfaces worn and torn in the ways which we have mentioned are\r\nsaid to be glaciated. But it must not be supposed that a glacier\r\neverywhere glaciates its bed. Although in places it acts as a rasp\r\nor as a pick, in others, and especially where its pressure is\r\nleast, as near the terminus, it moves over its bed in the manner\r\nof a sled. Instances are known where glaciers have advanced over\r\ndeposits of sand and gravel without disturbing them to any notable\r\ndegree. Like a river, a glacier does not everywhere erode. In\r\nplaces it leaves its bed undisturbed and in places aggrades it by\r\ndeposits of the ground moraine.\r\n\r\nCIRQUES. Valley glaciers commonly head as we have seen, in broad\r\namphitheaters deeply filled with snow and ice. On mountains now\r\ndestitute of glaciers, but whose glaciation shows that they have\r\nsupported glaciers in the past, there are found similar crescentic\r\nhollows with high, precipitous walls and glaciated floors. Their\r\nfloors are often basined and hold lakelets whose deep and quiet\r\nwaters reflect the sheltering ramparts of rugged rock which tower\r\nfar above them. Such mountain hollows are termed CIRQUES. As a\r\npowerful spring wears back a recess in the valley side where it\r\ndischarges, so the fountain head of a glacier gradually wears back\r\na cirque. In its slow movement the neve field broadly scours its\r\nbed to a flat or basined floor. Meanwhile the sides of the valley\r\nhead are steepened and driven back to precipitous walls. For in\r\nwinter the crevasse of the bergschrund which surrounds the neve\r\nfield is filled with snow and the neve is frozen fast to the rocky\r\nsides of the valley. In early summer the neve tears itself free,\r\ndislodging and removing any loosened blocks, and the open fissure\r\nof the bergschrund allows frost and other agencies of weathering\r\nto attack the unprotected rock. As cirques are thus formed and\r\nenlarged the peaks beneath which they lie are sharpened, and the\r\nmountain crests are scalloped and cut back from either side to\r\nknife-edged ridges.\r\n\r\nIn the western mountains of the United States many cirques, now\r\nempty of neve and glacier ice, and known locally as \"basins,\"\r\ntestify to the fact that in recent times the snow line stood\r\nbeneath the levels of their floors, and thus far below its present\r\naltitude.\r\n\r\nGLACIER TROUGHS. The channel worn to accommodate the big and\r\nclumsy glacier differs markedly from the river valley cut as with\r\na saw by the narrow and flexible stream and widened by the weather\r\nand the wash of rains. The valley glacier may easily be from one\r\nthousand to three thousand feet deep and from one to three miles\r\nwide. Such a ponderous bulk of slowly moving ice does not readily\r\nadapt itself to sharp turns and a narrow bed. By scouring and\r\nplucking all resisting edges it develops a fitting channel with a\r\nwide, flat floor, and steep, smooth sides, above which are seen\r\nthe weathered slopes of stream-worn mountain valleys. Since the\r\ntrunk glacier requires a deeper channel than do its branches, the\r\nbed of a branch glacier enters the main trough at some distance\r\nabove the floor of the latter, although the surface of the two ice\r\nstreams may be accordant. Glacier troughs can be studied best\r\nwhere large glaciers have recently melted completely away, as is\r\nthe case in many valleys of the mountains of the western United\r\nStates and of central and northern Europe (Fig. 114). The typical\r\nglacier trough, as shown in such examples, is U-shaped, with a\r\nbroad, flat floor, and high, steep walls. Its walls are little\r\nbroken by projecting spurs and lateral ravines. It is as if a V-\r\nvalley cut by a river had afterwards been gouged deeper with a\r\ngigantic chisel, widening the floor to the width of the chisel\r\nblade, cutting back the spurs, and smoothing and steepening the\r\nsides. A river valley could only be as wide-floored as this after\r\nit had long been worn down to grade.\r\n\r\nThe floor of a glacier trough may not be graded; it is often\r\ninterrupted by irregular steps perhaps hundreds and even a\r\nthousand feet in height, over which the stream that now drains the\r\nvalley tumbles in waterfalls. Reaches between the steps are often\r\nbasined. Lakelets may occupy hollows excavated in solid rock, and\r\nother lakes may be held behind terminal moraines left as dams\r\nacross the valley at pauses in the retreat of the glacier.\r\n\r\nFJORDS are glacier troughs now occupied in part or wholly by the\r\nsea, either because they were excavated by a tide glacier to their\r\npresent depth below sea level, or because of a submergence of the\r\nland. Their characteristic form is that of a long, deep, narrow\r\nbay with steep rock walls and basined floor. Fjords are found only\r\nin regions which have suffered glaciation, such as Norway and\r\nAlaska.\r\n\r\nHANGING VALLEYS. These are lateral valleys which open on their\r\nmain valley some distance above its floor. They are conspicuous\r\nfeatures of glacier troughs from which the ice has vanished; for\r\nthe trunk glacier in widening and deepening its channel cut its\r\nbed below the bottoms of the lateral valleys.\r\n\r\nSince the mouths of hanging valleys are suspended on the walls of\r\nthe glacier trough, their streams are compelled to plunge down its\r\nsteep, high sides in waterfalls. Some of the loftiest and most\r\nbeautiful waterfalls of the world leap from hanging valleys,--\r\namong them the celebrated Staubbach of the Lauterbrunnen valley of\r\nSwitzerland, and those of the fjords of Norway and Alaska.\r\n\r\nHanging valleys are found also in river gorges where the smaller\r\ntributaries have not been able to keep pace with a strong master\r\nstream in cutting down their beds. In this case, however, they are\r\na mark of extreme youth; for, as the trunk stream approaches grade\r\nand its velocity and power to erode its bed decrease, the side\r\nstreams soon cut back their falls and wear their beds at their\r\nmouths to a common level with that of the main river. The Grand\r\nCanyon of the Colorado must be reckoned a young valley. At its\r\nbase it narrows to scarcely more than the width of the river, and\r\nyet its tributaries, except the very smallest, enter it at a\r\ncommon level.\r\n\r\nWhy could not a wide-floored valley, such as a glacier trough,\r\nwith hanging valleys opening upon it, be produced in the normal\r\ndevelopment of a river valley?\r\n\r\nTHE TROUGHS OF YOUNG AND OF MATURE GLACIERS. The features of a\r\nglacier trough depend much on the length of time the preexisting\r\nvalley was occupied with ice. During the infancy of a glacier, we\r\nmay believe, the spurs of the valley which it fills are but little\r\nblunted and its bed is but little broken by steps. In youth the\r\nglacier develops icefalls, as a river in youth develops\r\nwaterfalls, and its bed becomes terraced with great stairs. The\r\nmature glacier, like the mature river, has effaced its falls and\r\nsmoothed its bed to grade. It has also worn back the projecting\r\nspurs of its valley, making itself a wide channel with smooth\r\nsides. The bed of a mature glacier may form a long basin, since it\r\nabrades most in its upper and middle course, where its weight and\r\nmotion are the greatest. Near the terminus, where weight and\r\nmotion are the least, it erodes least, and may instead deposit a\r\nsheet of ground moraine, much as a river builds a flood plain in\r\nthe same part of its course as it approaches maturity. The bed of\r\na mature glacier thus tends to take the form of a long, relatively\r\nnarrow basin, across whose lower end may be stretched the dam of\r\nthe terminal moraine. On the disappearance of the ice the basin is\r\nrilled with a long, narrow lake, such as Lake Chelan in Washington\r\nand many of the lakes in the Highlands of Scotland.\r\n\r\nPiedmont glaciers apparently erode but little. Beneath their lake-\r\nlike expanse of sluggish or stagnant ice a broad sheet of ground\r\nmoraine is probably being deposited.\r\n\r\nCirques and glaciated valleys rapidly lose their characteristic\r\nforms after the ice has withdrawn. The weather destroys all\r\nsmoothed, polished, and scored surfaces which are not protected\r\nbeneath glacial deposits. The oversteepened sides of the trough\r\nare graded by landslips, by talus slopes, and by alluvial cones.\r\nMorainic heaps of drift are dissected and carried away. Hanging\r\nvalleys and the irregular bed of the trough are both worn down to\r\ngrade by the streams which now occupy them. The length of time\r\nsince the retreat of the ice from a mountain valley may thus be\r\nestimated by the degree to which the destruction of the\r\ncharacteristic features of the glacier trough has been carried.\r\n\r\nIn Figure 104 what characteristics of a glacier trough do you\r\nnotice? What inference do you draw as to the former thickness of\r\nthe glacier?\r\n\r\nName all the evidences you would expect to find to prove the fact\r\nthat in the recent geological past the valleys of the Alps\r\ncontained far larger glaciers than at present, and that on the\r\nnorth of the Alps the ice streams united in a piedmont glacier\r\nwhich extended across the plains of Switzerland to the sides of\r\nthe Jura Mountains.\r\n\r\nTHE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF GLACIERS AND OF RIVERS. Powerful as\r\nglaciers are, and marked as are the land forms which they produce,\r\nit is easy to exaggerate their geological importance as compared\r\nwith rivers. Under present climatic conditions they are confined\r\nto lofty mountains or polar lands. Polar ice sheets are permanent\r\nonly so long as the lands remain on which they rest. Mountain\r\nglaciers can stay only the brief time during which the ranges\r\ncontinue young and high. As lofty mountains, such as the Selkirks\r\nand the Alps, are lowered by frost and glacier ice, the snowfall\r\nwill decrease, the line of permanent snow will rise, and as the\r\nmountain hollows in which snow may gather are worn beneath the\r\nsnow line, the glaciers must disappear. Under present climatic\r\nconditions the work of glaciers is therefore both local and of\r\nshort duration.\r\n\r\nEven the glacial epoch, during which vast ice sheets deposited\r\ndrift over northeastern North America, must have been brief as\r\nwell as recent, for many lofty mountains, such as the Rockies and\r\nthe Alps, still bear the marks of great glaciers which then filled\r\ntheir valleys. Had the glacial epoch been long, as the earth\r\ncounts time, these mountains would have been worn low by ice; had\r\nthe epoch been remote, the marks of glaciation would already have\r\nbeen largely destroyed by other agencies.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, rivers are well-nigh universally at work over\r\nthe land surfaces of the globe, and ever since the dry land\r\nappeared they have been constantly engaged in leveling the\r\ncontinents and in delivering to the seas the waste which there is\r\nbuilt into the stratified rocks.\r\n\r\nICEBERGS. Tide glaciers, such as those of Greenland and Alaska,\r\nare able to excavate their beds to a considerable distance below\r\nsea level. From their fronts the buoyancy of sea water raises and\r\nbreaks away great masses of ice which float out to sea as\r\nicebergs. Only about one seventh of a mass of glacier ice floats\r\nabove the surface, and a berg three hundred feet high may be\r\nestimated to have been detached from a glacier not less than two\r\nthousand feet thick where it met the sea.\r\n\r\nIcebergs transport on their long journeys whatever drift they may\r\nhave carried when part of the glacier, and scatter it, as they\r\nmelt, over the ocean floor. In this way pebbles torn by the inland\r\nice from the rocks of the interior of Greenland and glaciated\r\nduring their carriage in the ground moraine are dropped at last\r\namong the oozes of the bottom of the North Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF THE WIND\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now to study the geological work of the currents of the\r\natmosphere, and to learn how they erode, and transport and deposit\r\nwaste as they sweep over the land. Illustrations of the wind's\r\nwork are at hand in dry weather on any windy day.\r\n\r\nClouds of dust are raised from the street and driven along by the\r\ngale. Here the roadway is swept bare; and there, in sheltered\r\nplaces, the dust settles in little windrows. The erosive power of\r\nwaste-laden currents of air is suggested as the sharp grains of\r\nflying sand sting one's face or clatter against the window. In the\r\ncountry one sometimes sees the dust whirled in clouds from dry,\r\nplowed fields in spring and left in the lee of fences in small\r\ndrifts resembling in form those of snow in winter.\r\n\r\nTHE ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS for the wind's conspicuous work are\r\nillustrated in these simple examples; they are aridity and the\r\nabsence of vegetation. In humid climates these conditions are only\r\nrarely and locally met; for the most part a thick growth of\r\nvegetation protects the moist soil from the wind with a cover of\r\nleaves and stems and a mattress of interlacing roots. But in arid\r\nregions either vegetation is wholly lacking, or scant growths are\r\nfound huddled in detached clumps, leaving interspaces of\r\nunprotected ground (Fig. 119). Here, too, the mantle of waste,\r\nwhich is formed chiefly under the action of temperature changes,\r\nremains dry and loose for long periods. Little or no moisture is\r\npresent to cause its particles to cohere, and they are therefore\r\nreadily lifted and drifted by the wind.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION BY THE WIND\r\n\r\nIn the desert the finer waste is continually swept to and fro by\r\nthe ever-shifting wind. Even in quiet weather the air heated by\r\ncontact with the hot sands rises in whirls, and the dust is lifted\r\nin stately columns, sometimes as much as one thousand feet in\r\nheight, which march slowly across the plain. In storms the sand is\r\ndriven along the ground in a continuous sheet, while the air is\r\ntilled with dust. Explorers tell of sand storms in the deserts of\r\ncentral Asia and Africa, in which the air grows murky and\r\nsuffocating. Even at midday it may become dark as night, and\r\nnothing can be heard except the roar of the blast and the whir of\r\nmyriads of grains of sand as they fly past the ear.\r\n\r\nSand storms are by no means uncommon in the arid regions of the\r\nwestern United States. In a recent year, six were reported from\r\nYuma, Arizona. Trains on transcontinental railways are\r\noccasionally blockaded by drifting sand, and the dust sifts into\r\nclosed passenger coaches, covering the seats and floors. After\r\nsuch a storm thirteen car loads of sand were removed from the\r\nplatform of a station on a western railway.\r\n\r\nDUST FALLS. Dust launched by upward-whirling winds on the swift\r\ncurrents of the upper air is often blown for hundreds of miles\r\nbeyond the arid region from which it was taken. Dust falls from\r\nwestern storms are not unknown even as far east as the Great\r\nLakes. In 1896 a \"black snow\" fell in Chicago, and in another dust\r\nstorm in the same decade the amount of dust carried in the air\r\nover Rock Island, Ill., was estimated at more than one thousand\r\ntons to the cubic mile.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1901, a cyclonic storm carried vast quantities of dust\r\nfrom the Sahara northward across the Mediterranean to fall over\r\nsouthern and central Europe. On March 8th dust storms raged in\r\nsouthern Algeria; two days later the dust fell in Italy; and on\r\nthe 11th it had reached central Germany and Denmark. It is\r\nestimated that in these few days one million eight hundred\r\nthousand tons of waste were carried from northern Africa and\r\ndeposited on European soil.\r\n\r\nWe may see from these examples the importance of the wind as an\r\nagent of transportation, and how vast in the aggregate are the\r\nloads which it carries. There are striking differences between air\r\nand water as carriers of waste. Rivers flow in fixed and narrow\r\nchannels to definite goals. The channelless streams of the air\r\nsweep across broad areas, and, shifting about continually, carry\r\ntheir loads back and forth, now in one direction and now in\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nWIND DEPOSITS\r\n\r\nThe mantle of waste of deserts is rapidly sorted by the wind. The\r\ncoarser rubbish, too heavy to be lifted into the air, is left to\r\nstrew wide tracts with residual gravels (Fig. 120). The sand\r\nderived from the disintegration of desert rocks gathers in vast\r\nfields. About one eighth of the surface of the Sahara is said to\r\nbe thus covered with drifting sand. In desert mountains, as those\r\nof Sinai, it lies like fields of snow in the high valleys below\r\nthe sharp peaks. On more level tracts it accumulates in seas of\r\nsand, sometimes, as in the deserts of Arabia, two hundred and more\r\nfeet deep.\r\n\r\nDUNES. The sand thus accumulated by the wind is heaped in wavelike\r\nhills called dunes. In the desert of northwestern India, where the\r\nprevalent wind is of great strength, the sand is laid in\r\nlongitudinal dunes, i.e. in stripes running parallel with the\r\ndirection of the wind; but commonly dunes lie, like ripple marks,\r\ntransverse to the wind current. On the windward side they show a\r\nlong, gentle slope, up which grains of sand can readily be moved;\r\nwhile to the lee their slope is frequently as great as the angle\r\nof repose (Fig. 122). Dunes whose sands are not fixed by\r\nvegetation travel slowly with the wind; for their material is ever\r\nshifted forward as the grains are driven up the windward slope\r\nand, falling over the crest, are deposited in slanting layers in\r\nthe quiet of the lee.\r\n\r\nLike river deposits, wind-blown sands are stratified, since they\r\nare laid by currents of air varying in intensity, and therefore\r\nin transporting power, which carry now finer and now coarser\r\nmaterials and lay them down where their velocity is checked (Fig.\r\n123). Since the wind varies in direction, the strata dip in\r\nvarious directions. They also dip at various angles, according to\r\nthe inclination of the surface on which they were laid.\r\n\r\nDunes occur not only in arid regions, but also wherever loose sand\r\nlies unprotected by vegetation from the wind. From the beaches of\r\nsea and lake shores the wind drives inland the surface sand left\r\ndry between tides and after storms, piling it in dunes which may\r\ninvade forests and fields and bury villages beneath their slowly\r\nadvancing waves. On flood plains during summer droughts river\r\ndeposits are often worked over by the wind; the sand is heaped in\r\nhummocks and much of the fine silt is caught and held by the\r\nforests and grassy fields of the bordering hills.\r\n\r\nThe sand of shore dunes differs little in composition and the\r\nshape of its grains from that of the beach from which it was\r\nderived. But in deserts, by the long wear of grain on grain as\r\nthey are blown hither and thither by the wind, all soft minerals\r\nare ground to powder and the sand comes to consist almost wholly\r\nof smooth round grams of hard quartz.\r\n\r\nSome marine sandstones, such as the St. Peter sandstone of the\r\nupper Mississippi valley, are composed so entirely of polished\r\nspherules of quartz that it has been believed by some that their\r\ngrains were long blown about in ancient deserts before they were\r\ndeposited in the sea.\r\n\r\nDUST DEPOSITS. As desert sands are composed almost wholly of\r\nquartz, we may ask what has become of the softer minerals of which\r\nthe rocks whose disintegration has supplied the sand were in part,\r\nand often in large part, composed. The softer minerals have been\r\nground to powder, and little by little the quartz sand also is\r\nworn by attrition to fine dust. Yet dust deposits are scant and\r\nfew in great deserts such as the Sahara. The finer waste is blown\r\nbeyond its limits and laid in adjacent oceans, where it adds to\r\nthe muds and oozes of their floors, and on bordering steppes and\r\nforest lands, where it is bound fast by vegetation and slowly\r\naccumulates in deposits of unstratified loose yellow earth. The\r\nfine waste of the Sahara has been identified in dredgings from the\r\nbottom of the Atlantic Ocean, taken hundreds of miles from the\r\ncoast of Africa.\r\n\r\nLOESS. In northern China an area as large as France is deeply\r\ncovered with a yellow pulverulent earth called loess (German,\r\nloose), which many consider a dust deposit blown from the great\r\nMongolian desert lying to the west. Loess mantles the recently\r\nuplifted mountains to the height of eight thousand feet and\r\ndescends on the plains nearly to sea level. Its texture and lack\r\nof stratification give it a vertical cleavage; hence it stands in\r\nsteep cliffs on the sides of the deep and narrow trenches which\r\nhave been cut in it by streams.\r\n\r\nOn loess hillsides in China are thousands of villages whose\r\neavelike dwellings have been excavated in this soft, yet firm, dry\r\nloam. While dust falls are common at the present time in this\r\nregion, the loess is now being rapidly denuded by streams, and its\r\nyellow silt gives name to the muddy Hwang-ho (Yellow River), and\r\nto the Yellow Sea, whose waters it discolors for scores of miles\r\nfrom shore.\r\n\r\nWind deposits both of dust and of sand may be expected to contain\r\nthe remains of land shells, bits of wood, and bones of land\r\nanimals, testifying to the fact that they were accumulated in open\r\nair and not in the sea or in bodies of fresh water.\r\n\r\nWIND EROSION\r\n\r\nSand-laden currents of air abrade and smooth and polish exposed\r\nrock surfaces, acting in much the same way as does the jet of\r\nsteam fed with sharp sand, which is used in the manufacture of\r\nground glass. Indeed, in a single storm at Cape Cod a plate glass\r\nof a lighthouse was so ground by flying sand that its transparency\r\nwas destroyed and its removal made necessary.\r\n\r\nTelegraph poles and wires whetted by wind-blown sands are\r\ndestroyed within a few years. In rocks of unequal resistance the\r\nharder parts are left in relief, while the softer are etched away.\r\nThus in the pass of San Bernardino, Cal., through which strong\r\nwinds stream from the west, crystals of garnet are left projecting\r\non delicate rock fingers from the softer rock in which they were\r\nimbedded.\r\n\r\nWind-carved pebbles are characteristically planed, the facets\r\nmeeting along a summit ridge or at a point like that of a pyramid.\r\nWe may suppose that these facets were ground by prevalent winds\r\nfrom certain directions, or that from time to time the stone was\r\nundermined and rolled over as the sand beneath it was blown away\r\non the windward side, thus exposing fresh surfaces to the driving\r\nsand. Such wind-carved pebbles are sometimes found in ancient\r\nrocks and may be accepted as evidence that the sands of which the\r\nrocks are composed were blown about by the wind.\r\n\r\nDEFLATION. In the denudation of an arid region, wind erosion is\r\ncomparatively ineffective as compared with deflation (Latin, de,\r\nfrom; flare, to blow),--a term by which is meant the constant\r\nremoval of waste by the wind, leaving the rocks bare to the\r\ncontinuous attack of the weather. In moist climates denudation is\r\ncontinually impeded by the mantle of waste and its cover of\r\nvegetation, and the land surface can be lowered no faster than the\r\nwaste is removed by running water. Deep residual soils come to\r\nprotect all regions of moderate slope, concealing from view the\r\nrock structure, and the various forms of the land are due more to\r\nthe agencies of erosion and transportation than to differences in\r\nthe resistance of the underlying rocks.\r\n\r\nBut in arid regions the mantle is rapidly removed, even from well-\r\nnigh level plains and plateaus, by the sweep of the wind and the\r\nwash of occasional rains. The geological structure of these\r\nregions of naked rock can be read as far as the eye can see, and\r\nit is to this structure that the forms of the land are there\r\nlargely due. In a land mass of horizontal strata, for example, any\r\nsofter surface rocks wear down to some underlying, resistant\r\nstratum, and this for a while forms the surface of a level plateau\r\n(Fig. 129). The edges of the capping layer, together with those of\r\nany softer layers beneath it, wear back in steep cliffs, dissected\r\nby the valleys of wet-weather streams and often swept bare to the\r\nbase by the wind. As they are little protected by talus, which\r\ncommonly is removed about as fast as formed, these escarpments and\r\nthe walls of the valleys retreat indefinitely, exposing some hard\r\nstratum beneath which forms the floor of a widening terrace.\r\n\r\nThe high plateaus of northern Arizona and southern Utah, north of\r\nthe Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, are composed of stratified\r\nrocks more than ten thousand feet thick and of very gentle\r\ninclination northward. From the broad plat form in which the\r\ncanyon has been cut rises a series of gigantic stairs, which are\r\noften more than one thousand feet high and a score or more of\r\nmiles in breadth. The retreating escarpments, the cliffs of the\r\nmesas and buttes which they have left behind as outliers, and the\r\nwalls of the ravines are carved into noble architectural forms--\r\ninto cathedrals, pyramids, amphitheaters, towers, arches, and\r\ncolonnades--by the processes of weathering aided by deflation. It\r\nis thus by the help of the action of the wind that great plateaus\r\nin arid regions are dissected and at last are smoothed away to\r\nwaterless plains, either composed of naked rock, or strewed with\r\nresidual gravels, or covered with drifting residual sand.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of air is 1/823 that of water. How does this\r\nfact affect the weight of the material which each can carry at the\r\nsame velocity?\r\n\r\nIf the rainfall should lessen in your own state to from five to\r\nten inches a year, what changes would take place in the vegetation\r\nof the country? in the soil? in the streams? in the erosion of\r\nvalleys? in the agencies chiefly at work in denuding the land?\r\n\r\nIn what way can a wind-carved pebble be distinguished from a\r\nriver-worn pebble? from a glaciated pebble?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE SEA AND ITS SHORES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the ocean is the goal at which the waste\r\nof the land arrives. The mantle of rock waste, creeping down\r\nslopes, is washed to the sea by streams, together with the\r\nmaterial which the streams have worn from their beds and that\r\ndissolved by underground waters. In arid regions the winds sweep\r\nwaste either into bordering oceans or into more humid regions\r\nwhere rivers take it up and carry it on to the sea. Glaciers\r\ndeliver the load of their moraines either directly to the sea or\r\nleave it for streams to transport to the same goal. All deposits\r\nmade on the land, such as the flood plains of rivers, the silts of\r\nlake beds, dune sands, and sheets of glacial drift, mark but\r\npauses in the process which is to bring all the materials of the\r\nland now above sea level to rest upon the ocean bed.\r\n\r\nBut the sea is also at work along all its shores as an agent of\r\ndestruction, and we must first take up its work in erosion before\r\nwe consider how it transports and deposits the waste of the land.\r\n\r\nSEA EROSION\r\n\r\nTHE SEA CLIFF AND THE ROCK BENCH. On many coasts the land fronts\r\nthe ocean in a line of cliffs. To the edge of the cliffs there\r\nlead down valleys and ridges, carved by running water, which, if\r\nextended, would meet the water surface some way out from shore.\r\nEvidently they are now abruptly cut short at the present shore\r\nline because the land has been cut back.\r\n\r\nAlong the foot of the cliff lies a gently shelving bench of rock,\r\nmore or less thickly veneered with sand and shingle. At low tide\r\nits inner margin is laid bare, but at high tide it is covered\r\nwholly, and the sea washes the base of the cliffs. A notch, of\r\nwhich the SEA CLIFF and the ROCK BENCH are the two sides, has been\r\ncut along the shore.\r\n\r\nWAVES. The position of the rock bench, with its inner margin\r\nslightly above low tide, shows that it has been cut by some agent\r\nwhich acts like a horizontal saw set at about sea level. This\r\nagent is clearly the surface agitation of the water; it is the\r\nwind-raised wave.\r\n\r\nAs a wave comes up the shelving bench the crest topples forward\r\nand the wave \"breaks,\" striking a blow whose force is measured by\r\nthe momentum of all its tons of falling water. On the coast of\r\nScotland the force of the blows struck by the waves of the\r\nheaviest storms has sometimes exceeded three tons to the square\r\nfoot. But even a calm sea constantly chafes the shore. It heaves\r\nin gentle undulations known as the ground swell, the result of\r\nstorms perhaps a thousand miles distant, and breaks on the shore\r\nin surf.\r\n\r\nThe blows of the waves are not struck with clear water only, else\r\nthey would have little effect on cliffs of solid rock. Storm waves\r\narm themselves with the sand and gravel, the cobbles, and even the\r\nlarge bowlders which lie at the base of the cliff, and beat\r\nagainst it with these hammers of stone.\r\n\r\nWhere a precipice descends sheer into deep water, waves swash up\r\nand down the face of the rocks but cannot break and strike\r\neffective blows. They therefore erode but little until the talus\r\nfallen from the cliff is gradually built up beneath the sea to the\r\nlevel at which the waves drag bottom upon it and break.\r\n\r\nCompare the ways in which different agents abrade. The wind\r\nlightly brushes sand and dust over exposed surfaces of rock.\r\nRunning water sweeps fragments of various sizes along its\r\nchannels, holding them with a loose hand. Glacial ice grinds the\r\nstones of its ground moraine against the underlying rock with the\r\npressure of its enormous weight. The wave hurls fragments of rock\r\nagainst the sea cliff, bruising and battering it by the blow. It\r\nalso rasps the bench as it drags sand and gravel to and fro upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWEATHERING OF SEA CLIFFS. The sea cliff furnishes the weapons for\r\nits own destruction. They are broken from it not only by the wave\r\nbut also by the weather. Indeed the sea cliff weathers more\r\nrapidly, as a rule, than do rock ledges inland. It is abundantly\r\nwet with spray. Along its base the ground water of the neighboring\r\nland finds its natural outlet in springs which under mine it.\r\nMoreover, it is unprotected by any shield of talus. Fragments of\r\nrock as they fall from its face are battered to pieces by the\r\nwaves and swept out to sea. The cliff is thus left exposed to the\r\nattack of the weather, and its retreat would be comparatively\r\nrapid for this reason alone.\r\n\r\nSea cliffs seldom overhang, but commonly, as in Figure 134, slope\r\nseaward, showing that the upper portion has retreated at a more\r\nrapid rate than has the base. Which do you infer is on the whole\r\nthe more destructive agent, weathering or the wave?\r\n\r\nDraw a section of a sea cliff cut in well jointed rocks whose\r\njoints dip toward the land. Draw a diagram of a sea cliff where\r\nthe joints dip toward the sea.\r\n\r\nSEA CAVES. The wave does not merely batter the face of the cliff.\r\nLike a skillful quarryman it inserts wedges in all natural\r\nfissures, such as joints, and uses explosive forces. As a wave\r\nflaps against a crevice it compresses the air within with the\r\nsudden stroke; as it falls back the air as suddenly expands. On\r\nlighthouses heavily barred doors have been burst outward by the\r\nexplosive force of the air within, as it was released from\r\npressure when a partial vacuum was formed by the refluence of the\r\nwave. Where a crevice is filled with water the entire force of the\r\nblow of the wave is transmitted by hydraulic pressure to the sides\r\nof the fissure. Thus storm waves little by little pry and suck the\r\nrock loose, and in this way, and by the blows which they strike\r\nwith the stones of the beach, they quarry out about a joint, or\r\nwherever the rock may be weak, a recess known as a SEA CAVE,\r\nprovided that the rock above is coherent enough to form a roof.\r\nOtherwise an open chasm results.\r\n\r\nBLOWHOLES AND SEA ARCHES. As a sea cave is drilled back into the\r\nrock, it may encounter a joint or crevice opened to the surface by\r\npercolating water. The shock of the waves soon enlarges this to a\r\nblowhole, which one may find on the breezy upland, perhaps a\r\nhundred yards and more back from the cliff's edge. In quiet\r\nweather the blowhole is a deep well; in storm it plays a fountain\r\nas the waves drive through the long tunnel below and spout their\r\nspray high in air in successive jets. As the roof of the cave thus\r\nbreaks down in the rear, there may remain in front for a while a\r\nsea arch, similar to the natural bridges of land caverns.\r\n\r\nSTACKS AND WAVE-CUT ISLANDS. As the sea drives its tunnels and\r\nopen drifts into the cliff, it breaks through behind the\r\nintervening portions and leaves them isolated as stacks, much as\r\nmonuments are detached from inland escarpments by the weather; and\r\nas the sea cliff retreats, these remnant masses may be left behind\r\nas rocky islets. Thus the rock bench is often set with stacks,\r\nislets in all stages of destruction, and sunken reefs, all wrecks\r\nof the land testifying to its retreat before the incessant attack\r\nof the waves.\r\n\r\nCOVES. Where zones of soft or closely jointed rock outcrop along a\r\nshore, or where minor water courses conic down to the sea and aid\r\nin erosion, the shore is worn back in curved reentrants called\r\ncoves; while the more resistant rocks on either hand are left\r\nprojecting as headlands (Fig. 139). After coves are cut back a\r\nshort distance by the waves, the headlands come to protect them,\r\nas with breakwaters, and prevent their indefinite retreat. The\r\nshore takes a curve of equilibrium, along which the hard rock of\r\nthe exposed headland and the weak rock of the protected cove wear\r\nback at an equal rate.\r\n\r\nRATE OF RECESSION. The rate at which a shore recedes depends on\r\nseveral factors. In soft or incoherent rocks exposed to violent\r\nstorms the retreat is so rapid as to be easily measured. The coast\r\nof Yorkshire, England, whose cliffs are cut in glacial drift,\r\nloses seven feet a year on the average, and since the Norman\r\nconquest a strip a mile wide, with farmsteads and villages and\r\nhistoric seaports, has been devoured by the sea. The sandy south\r\nshore of Martha's Vineyard wears back three feet a year. But hard\r\nrocks retreat so slowly that their recession has seldom been\r\nmeasured by the records of history.\r\n\r\nSHORE DRIFT\r\n\r\nBOWLDER AND PEBBLE BEACHES. About as fast as formed the waste of\r\nthe sea cliff is swept both along the shore and out to sea. The\r\nroad of waste along shore is the BEACH. We may also define the\r\nbeach as the exposed edge of the sheet of sediment formed by the\r\ncarriage of land waste out to sea. At the foot of sea cliffs,\r\nwhere the waves are pounding hardest, one commonly finds the rock\r\nbench strewn on its inner margin with large stones, dislodged by\r\nthe waves and by the weather and some-what worn on their corners\r\nand edges. From this BOWLDER BEACH the smaller fragments of waste\r\nfrom the cliff and the fragments into which the bowlders are at\r\nlast broken drift on to more sheltered places and there accumulate\r\nin a PEBBLE BEACH, made of pebbles well rounded by the wear which\r\nthey have suffered. Such beaches form a mill whose raw material is\r\nconstantly supplied by the cliff. The breakers of storms set it in\r\nmotion to a depth of several feet, grinding the pebbles together\r\nwith a clatter to be heard above the roar of the surf. In such a\r\nrock crusher the life of a pebble is short. Where ships have\r\nstranded on our Atlantic coast with cargoes of hard-burned brick\r\nor of coal, a year of time and a drift of five miles along the\r\nshore have proved enough to wear brick and coal to powder. At no\r\ngreat distance from their source, therefore, pebble beaches give\r\nplace to beaches of sand, which occupy the more sheltered reaches\r\nof the shore.\r\n\r\nSAND BEACHES. The angular sand grains of various minerals into\r\nwhich pebbles are broken by the waves are ground together under\r\nthe beating surf and rounded, and those of the softer minerals are\r\ncrushed to powder. The process, however, is a slow one, and if we\r\nstudy these sand grains under a lens we may be surprised to see\r\nthat, though their corners and edges have been blunted, they are\r\nyet far from the spherical form of the pebbles from which they\r\nwere derived. The grains are small, and in water they have lost\r\nabout half their weiglit in air; the blows which they strike one\r\nanother are therefore weak. Besides, each grain of sand of the wet\r\nbeach is protected by a cushion of water from the blows of its\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nThe shape and size of these grains and the relative proportion of\r\ngrains of the softer minerals which still remain give a rough\r\nmeasure of the distance in space and time which they have traveled\r\nfrom their source. The sand of many beaches, derived from the\r\nrocks of adjacent cliffs or brought in by torrential streams from\r\nneighboring highlands, is dark with grains of a number of minerals\r\nsofter than quartz. The white sand of other beaches, as those of\r\nthe east coast of Florida, is almost wholly composed of quartz\r\ngrains; for in its long travel down the Atlantic coast the weaker\r\nminerals have been worn to powder and the hardest alone survive.\r\n\r\nHow does the absence of cleavage in quartz affect the durability\r\nof quartz sand?\r\n\r\nHOW SHORE DRIFT MIGRATES. It is under the action of waves and\r\ncurrents that shore drift migrates slowly along a coast. Where\r\nwaves strike a coast obliquely they drive the waste before them\r\nlittle by little along the shore. Thus on a north-south coast,\r\nwhere the predominant storms are from the northeast, there will be\r\na migration of shore drift southwards.\r\n\r\nAll shores are swept also by currents produced by winds and tides.\r\nThese are usually far too gentle to transport of themselves the\r\ncoarse materials of which beaches are made. But while the wave\r\nstirs the grains of sand and gravel, and for a moment lifts them\r\nfrom the bottom, the current carries them a step forward on their\r\nway. The current cannot lift and the wave cannot carry, but\r\ntogether the two transport the waste along the shore. The road of\r\nshore drift is therefore the zone of the breaking waves.\r\n\r\nTHE BAY-HEAD BEACH. As the waste derived from the wear of waves\r\nand that brought in by streams is trailed along a coast it\r\nassumes, under varying conditions, a number of distinct forms.\r\nWhen swept into the head of a sheltered bay it constitutes the\r\nbay-head beach. By the highest storm waves the beach is often\r\nbuilt higher than the ground immediately behind it, and forms a\r\ndam inclosing a shallow pond or marsh.\r\n\r\nTHE BAY BAR. As the stream of shore drift reaches the mouth of a\r\nbay of some size it often occurs that, instead of turning in, it\r\nsets directly across toward the opposite headland. The waste is\r\ncarried out from shore into the deeper waters of the bay mouth;\r\nwhere it is no longer supported by the breaking waves, and sinks\r\nto the bottom. The dump is gradually built to the surface as a\r\nstubby spur, pointing across the bay, and as it reaches the zone\r\nof wave action current and wave can now combine to carry shore\r\ndrift along it, depositing their load continually at the point of\r\nthe spur. An embankment is thus constructed in much the same\r\nmanner as a railway fill, which, while it is building, serves as a\r\nroadway along which the dirt from an adjacent cut is carted to be\r\ndumped at the end. When the embankment is completed it bridges the\r\nbay with a highway along which shore drift now moves without\r\ninterruption, and becomes a bay bar.\r\n\r\nINCOMPLETE BAY BARS. Under certain conditions the sea cannot carry\r\nout its intention to bridge a bay. Rivers discharging in bays\r\ndemand open way to the ocean. Strong tidal currents also are able\r\nto keep open channels scoured by their ebb and flow. In such cases\r\nthe most that land waste can do is to build spits and shoals,\r\nnarrowing and shoaling the channel as much as possible. Incomplete\r\nbay bars sometimes have their points recurved by currents setting\r\nat right angles to the stream of shore drift and are then\r\nclassified as HOOKS (Fig. 142).\r\n\r\nSAND REEFS. On low coasts where shallow water extends some\r\ndistance out, the highway of shore drift lies along a low, narrow\r\nridge, termed the sand reef, separated from the land by a narrow\r\nstretch of shallow water called the LAGOON. At intervals the reef\r\nis held open by INLETS,--gaps through which the tide flows and\r\nebbs, and by which the water of streams finds way to the sea.\r\n\r\nNo finer example of this kind of shore line is to be found in the\r\nworld than the coast of Texas. From near the mouth of the Rio\r\nGrande a continuous sand reef draws its even curve for a hundred\r\nmiles to Corpus Christi Pass, and the reefs are but seldom\r\ninterrupted by inlets as far north as Galveston Harbor. On this\r\ncoast the tides are variable and exceptionally weak, being less\r\nthan one foot in height, while the amount of waste swept along the\r\nshore is large. The lagoon is extremely shallow, and much of it is\r\na mud flat too shoal for even small boats. On the coast of New\r\nJersey strong tides are able to keep open inlets at intervals of\r\nfrom two to twenty miles in spite of a heavy alongshore drift.\r\n\r\nSand reefs are formed where the water is so shallow near shore\r\nthat storm waves cannot run in it and therefore break some\r\ndistance out from land. Where storm waves first drag bottom they\r\nerode and deepen the sea floor, and sweep in sediment as far as\r\nthe line where they break. Here, where they lose their force, they\r\ndrop their load and beat up the ridge which is known as the sand\r\nreef when it reaches the surface.\r\n\r\nSHORES OF ELEVATION AND DEPRESSION\r\n\r\nOur studies have already brought to our notice two distinct forms\r\nof strand lines,--one the high, rocky coast cut back to cliffs by\r\nthe attack of the waves, and the other the low, sandy coast where\r\nthe waves break usually upon the sand reef. To understand the\r\norigin of these two types we must know that the meeting place of\r\nsea and land is determined primarily by movements of the earth's\r\ncrust. Where a coast land emerges the--shore line moves seaward;\r\nwhere it is being submerged the shore line advances on the land.\r\n\r\nSHORES OF ELEVATION. The retreat of the sea, either because of a\r\nlocal uplift of the land or for any other reason, such as the\r\nlowering of any portion of ocean bottom, lays bare the inner\r\nmargin of the sea floor. Where the sea floor has long received the\r\nwaste of the land it has been built up to a smooth, subaqueous\r\nplain, gently shelving from the land. Since the new shore line is\r\ndrawn across this even surface it is simple and regular, and is\r\nbordered on the one side by shallow water gradually deepening\r\nseaward, and on the other by low land composed of material which\r\nhas not yet thoroughly consolidated to firm rock. A sand reef is\r\nsoon beaten up by the waves, and for some time conditions will\r\nfavor its growth. The loss of sand driven into the lagoon beyond,\r\nand of that ground to powder by the surf and carried out to sea,\r\nis more than made up by the stream of alongshore drift, and\r\nespecially by the drag of sediments to the reef by the waves as\r\nthey deepen the sea floor on its seaward side.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the lagoon gradually fills with waste from the reef and\r\nfrom the land. It is invaded by various grasses and reeds which\r\nhave learned to grow in salt and brackish water; the marsh, laid\r\nbare only at low tide, is built above high tide by wind drift and\r\nvegetable deposits, and becomes a meadow, soldering the sand reef\r\nto the mainland.\r\n\r\nWhile the lagoon has been filling, the waves have been so\r\ndeepening the sea floor off the sand reef that at last they are\r\nable to attack it vigorously. They now wear it back, and, driving\r\nthe shore line across the lagoon or meadow, cut a line of low\r\ncliffs on the mainland. Such a shore is that of Gascony in\r\nsouthwestern France,--a low, straight, sandy shore, bordered by\r\ndunes and unprotected by reefs from the attack of the waves of the\r\nBay of Biscay.\r\n\r\nWe may say, then, that on shores of elevation the presence of sand\r\nreefs and lagoons indicates the stage of youth, while the absence\r\nof these features and the vigorous and unimpeded attack by the sea\r\nupon the mainland indicate the stage of maturity. Where much waste\r\nis brought in by rivers the maturity of such a coast may be long\r\ndelayed. The waste from the land keeps the sea shallow offshore\r\nand constantly renews the sand reef. The energy of the waves is\r\nconsumed in handling shore drift, and no energy is left for an\r\neffective attack upon the land. Indeed, with an excessive amount\r\nof waste brought down by streams the land may be built out and\r\nencroach temporarily upon the sea; and not until long denudation\r\nhas lowered the land, and thus decreased the amount of waste from\r\nit, may the waves be able to cut through the sand reef and thus\r\nthe coast reach maturity.\r\n\r\nSHORES OF DEPRESSION\r\n\r\nWhere a coastal region is undergoing submergence the shore line\r\nmoves landward. The horizontal plane of the sea now intersects an\r\nold land surface roughened by subaerial denudation. The shore line\r\nis irregular and indented in proportion to the relief of the land\r\nand the amount of the submergence which the land has suffered. It\r\nfollows up partially submerged valleys, forming bays, and bends\r\nround the divides, leaving them to project as promontories and\r\npeninsulas. The outlines of shores of depression are as varied as\r\nare the forms of the land partially submerged. We give a few\r\ntypical illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the coast of Maine are due chiefly to the\r\nfact that a mountainous region of hard rocks, once worn to a\r\npeneplain, and after a subsequent elevation deeply dissected by\r\nnorth-south valleys, has subsided, the depression amounting on its\r\nsouthern margin to as much as six hundred feet below sea level.\r\nDrowned valleys penetrate the land in long, narrow bays, and\r\nrugged divides project in long, narrow land arms prolonged seaward\r\nby islands representing the high portions of their extremities. Of\r\nthis exceedingly ragged shore there are said to be two thousand\r\nmiles from the New Brunswick boundary as far west as Portland,--a\r\nstraight-line distance of but two hundred miles. Since the time of\r\nits greatest depression the land is known to have risen some three\r\nhundred feet; for the bays have been shortened, and the waste with\r\nwhich their floors were strewn is now in part laid bare as clay\r\nplains about the bay heads and in narrow selvages about the\r\npeninsulas and islands.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Dalmatia, on the Adriatic Sea, is characterized by\r\nlong land arms and chains of long and narrow islands, all parallel\r\nto the trend of the coast. A region of parallel mountain ranges\r\nhas been depressed, and the longitudinal valleys which lie between\r\nthem are occupied by arms of the sea.\r\n\r\nChesapeake Bay is a branching bay due to the depression of an\r\nancient coastal plain which, after having emerged from the sea,\r\nwas channeled with broad, shallow valleys. The sea has invaded the\r\nvalley of the trunk stream and those of its tributaries, forming a\r\nshallow bay whose many branches are all directed toward its axis\r\n(Fig. 146).\r\n\r\nHudson Bay, and the North, the Baltic, and the Yellow seas are\r\nexamples where the sinking of the land has brought the sea in over\r\nlow plains of large extent, thus deeply indenting the continental\r\nout-line. The rise of a few hundred feet would restore these\r\nsubmerged plains to the land.\r\n\r\nTHE CYCLE OF SHORES OF DEPRESSION. In its infantile stage the\r\noutline of a shore of depression depends almost wholly on the\r\nprevious relief of the land, and but little on erosion by the sea.\r\nSea cliffs and narrow benches appear where headlands and outlying\r\nislands have been nipped by the waves. As yet, little shore waste\r\nhas been formed. The coast of Maine is an example of this stage.\r\n\r\nIn early youth all promontories have been strongly cliffed, and\r\nunder a vigorous attack of the sea the shore of open bays may be\r\ncut back also. Sea stacks and rocky islets, caves and coves, make\r\nthe shore minutely ragged. The irregularity of the coast, due to\r\ndepression, is for a while increased by differential wave wear on\r\nharder and softer rocks. The rock bench is still narrow. Shore\r\nwaste, though being produced in large amounts, is for the most\r\npart swept into deeper water and buried out of sight. Examples of\r\nthis stage are the east coast of Scotland and the California coast\r\nnear San Francisco.\r\n\r\nLater youth is characterized by a large accumulation of shore\r\nwaste. The rock bench has been cut back so that it now furnishes a\r\ngood roadway for shore drift. The stream of alongshore drift grows\r\nlarger and larger, filling the heads of the smaller bays with\r\nbeaches, building spits and hooks, and tying islands with sand\r\nbars to the mainland. It bridges the larger bays with bay bars,\r\nwhile their length is being reduced as their inclosing\r\npromontories are cut back by the waves. Thus there comes to be a\r\nstraight, continuous, and easy road, no longer interrupted by\r\nheadlands and bays, for the transportation of waste alongshore.\r\nThe Baltic coast of Germany is in this stage.\r\n\r\nAll this while streams have been busy filling with delta deposits\r\nthe bays into which they empty. By these steps a coast gradually\r\nadvances to MATURITY, the stage when the irregularities due to\r\ndepression have been effaced, when outlying islands formed by\r\nsubsidence have been planed away, and when the shore line has been\r\ndriven back behind the former bay heads. The sea now attacks the\r\nland most effectively along a continuous and fairly straight line\r\nof cliffs. Although the first effect of wave wear was to increase\r\nthe irregularities of the shore, it sooner or later rectifies it,\r\nmaking it simple and smooth. Northwestern France may be cited as\r\nan upland plain, dissected and depressed, whose coast has reached\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nIn the OLD AGE of coasts the rock bench is cut back so far that\r\nthe waves can no longer exert their full effect upon the shore.\r\nTheir energy is dissipated in moving shore drift hither and\r\nthither and in abrading the bench when they drag bottom upon it.\r\nLittle by little the bench is deepened by tidal currents and the\r\ndrag of waves; but this process is so slow that meanwhile the sea\r\ncliffs melt down under the weather, and the bench becomes a broad\r\nshoal where waves and tides gradually work over the waste from the\r\nland to greater fineness and sweep it out to sea.\r\n\r\nPLAINS OF MARINE ABRASION. While subaerial denudation reduces the\r\nland to baselevel, the sea is sawing its edges to WAVE BASE, i.e.\r\nthe lowest limit of the wave's effective wear. The widened rock\r\nbench forms when uplifted a plain of marine abrasion, which like\r\nthe peneplain bevels across strata regardless of their various\r\ninclinations and various degrees of hardness.\r\n\r\nHow may a plain of marine abrasion be expected to differ from a\r\npeneplain in its mantle of waste?\r\n\r\nCompared with subaerial denudation, marine abrasion is a\r\ncomparatively feeble agent. At the rate of five feet per century--\r\na higher rate than obtains on the youthful rocky, coast of\r\nBritain--it would require more than ten million years to pare a\r\nstrip one hundred miles wide from the margin of a continent, a\r\ntime sufficient, at the rate at which the Mississippi valley is\r\nnow being worn away, for subaerial denudation to lower the lands\r\nof the globe to the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nSlow submergence favors the cutting of a wide rock bench. The\r\nwater continually deepens upon the bench; storm waves can\r\ntherefore always ride in to the base of the cliffs and attack them\r\nwith full force; shore waste cannot impede the onset of the waves,\r\nfor it is continually washed out in deeper water below wave base.\r\n\r\nBASAL CONGOLMERATES. As the sea marches across the land during a\r\nslow submergence, the platform is covered with sheets of sea-laid\r\nsediments. Lowest of these is a conglomerate,--the bowlder and\r\npebble beach, widened indefinitely by the retreat of the cliffs at\r\nwhose base it was formed, and preserved by the finer deposits laid\r\nupon it in the constantly deepening water as the land subsides.\r\nSuch basal conglomerates are not uncommon among the ancient rocks\r\nof the land, and we may know them by their rounded pebbles and\r\nlarger stones, composed of the same kind of rock as that of the\r\nabraded and evened surface on which they lie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nOFFSHORE AND DEEP-SEA DEPOSITS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alongshore deposits which we have now studied are the exposed\r\nedge of a vast subaqueous sheet of waste which borders the\r\ncontinents and extends often for as much as two or three hundred\r\nmiles from land. Soundings show that offshore deposits are laid in\r\nbelts parallel to the coast, the coarsest materials lying nearest\r\nto the land and the finest farthest out. The pebbles and gravel\r\nand the clean, coarse sand of beaches give place to broad\r\nstretches of sand, which grows finer and finer until it is\r\nsucceeded by sheets of mud. Clearly there is an offshore movement\r\nof waste by which it is sorted, the coarser being sooner dropped\r\nand the finer being carried farther out.\r\n\r\nOFFSHORE DEPOSITS\r\n\r\nThe debris torn by waves from rocky shores is far less in amount\r\nthan the waste of the land brought down to the sea by rivers,\r\nbeing only one thirty-third as great, according to a conservative\r\nestimate. Both mingle alongshore in all the forms of beach and bar\r\nthat have been described, and both are together slowly carried out\r\nto sea. On the shelving ocean floor waste is agitated by various\r\nmovements of the unquiet water,--by the undertow (an outward-\r\nrunning bottom current near the shore), by the ebb and flow of\r\ntides, by ocean currents where they approach the land, and by\r\nwaves and ground swells, whose effects are sometimes felt to a\r\ndepth of six hundred feet. By all these means the waste is slowly\r\nwashed to and fro, and as it is thus ground finer and finer and\r\nits soluble parts are more and more dissolved, it drifts farther\r\nand farther out from land. It is by no steady and rapid movement\r\nthat waste is swept from the shore to its final resting place. Day\r\nafter day and century after century the grains of sand and\r\nparticles of mud are shifted to and fro, winnowed and spread in\r\nlayers, which are destroyed and rebuilt again and again before\r\nthey are buried safe from further disturbance.\r\n\r\nThese processes which are hidden from the eye are among the most\r\nimportant of those with which our science has to do; for it is\r\nthey which have given shape to by far the largest part of the\r\nstratified rocks of which the land is made.\r\n\r\nTHE CONTINENTAL DELTA. This fitting term has been recently\r\nsuggested for the sheet of waste slowly accumulating along the\r\nborders of the continents. Within a narrow belt, which rarely\r\nexceeds two or three hundred miles, except near the mouths of\r\nmuddy rivers such as the Amazon and Congo, nearly all the waste of\r\nthe continent, whether worn from its surface by the weather, by\r\nstreams, by glaciers, or by the wind, or from its edge by the\r\nchafing of the waves, comes at last to its final resting place.\r\nThe agencies which spread the material of the continental delta\r\ngrow more and more feeble as they pass into deeper and more quiet\r\nwater away from shore. Coarse materials are therefore soon dropped\r\nalong narrow belts near land. Gravels and coarse sands lie in\r\nthick, wedge-shaped masses which thin out seaward rapidly and give\r\nplace to sheets of finer sand.\r\n\r\nSEA MUDS. Outermost of the sediments derived from the waste of the\r\ncontinents is a wide belt of mud; for fine clays settle so slowly,\r\neven in sea water,--whose saltness causes them to sink much faster\r\nthan they would in fresh water,--that they are wafted far before\r\nthey reach a bottom where they may remain undisturbed. Muds are\r\nalso found near shore, carpeting the floors of estuaries, and\r\namong stretches of sandy deposits in hollows where the more quiet\r\nwater has permitted the finer silt to rest.\r\n\r\nSea muds are commonly bluish and consolidate to bluish shales; the\r\nred coloring matter brought from land waste--iron oxide--is\r\naltered to other iron compounds by decomposing organic matter in\r\nthe presence of sea water. Yellow and red muds occur where the\r\namount of iron oxide in the silt brought down to the sea by rivers\r\nis too great to be reduced, or decomposed, by the organic matter\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nGreen muds and green sand owe their color to certain chemical\r\nchanges which take place where waste from the land accumulates on\r\nthe sea floor with extreme slowness. A greenish mineral called\r\nGLAUCONITE--a silicate of iron and alumina--is then formed. Such\r\ndeposits, known as GREEN SAND, are now in process of making in\r\nseveral patches off the Atlantic coast, and are found on the\r\ncoastal plain of New Jersey among the offshore deposits of earlier\r\ngeological ages.\r\n\r\nORGANIC DEPOSITS. Living creatures swarm along the shore and on\r\nthe shallows out from land as nowhere else in the ocean. Seaweed\r\noften mantles the rock of the sea cliff between the levels of high\r\nand low tide, protecting it to some degree from the blows of\r\nwaves. On the rock bench each little pool left by the ebbing tide\r\nis an aquarium abounding in the lowly forms of marine life. Below\r\nlow-tide level occur beds of molluscous shells, such as the\r\noyster, with countless numbers of other humble organisms. Their\r\nharder parts--the shells of mollusks, the white framework of\r\ncorals, the carapaces of crabs and other crustaceans, the shells\r\nof sea urchins, the bones and teeth of fishes--are gradually\r\nburied within the accumulating sheets of sediment, either whole\r\nor, far more often, broken into fragments by the waves.\r\n\r\nBy means of these organic remains each layer of beach deposits and\r\nthose of the continental delta may contain a record of the life of\r\nthe time when it was laid. Such a record has been made ever since\r\nliving creatures with hard parts appeared upon the globe. We shall\r\nfind it sealed away in the stratified rocks of the continents,--\r\nparts of ancient sea deposits now raised to form the dry land.\r\nThus we have in the traces of living creatures found in the rocks,\r\ni.e. in fossils, a history of the progress of life upon the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nMOLLUSCOUS SHELL DEPOSITS. The forms of marine life of importance\r\nin rock making thrive best in clear water, where little sediment\r\nis being laid, and where at the same time the depth is not so\r\ngreat as to deprive them of needed light, heat, and of sufficient\r\noxygen absorbed by sea water from the air. In such clear and\r\ncomparatively shallow water there often grow countless myriads of\r\nanimals, such as mollusks and corals, whose shells and skeletons\r\nof carbonate of lime gradually accumulate in beds of limestone.\r\n\r\nA shell limestone made of broken fragments cemented together is\r\nsometimes called COQUINA, a local term applied to such beds\r\nrecently uplifted from the sea along the coast of Florida (Fig.\r\n149).\r\n\r\nOOLITIC limestone (oon, an egg; lithos, a stone) is so named from\r\nthe likeness of the tiny spherules which compose it to the roe of\r\nfish. Corals and shells have been pounded by the waves to\r\ncalcareous sand, and each grain has been covered with successive\r\nconcentric coatings of lime carbonate deposited about it from\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nThe impalpable powder to which calcareous sand is ground by the\r\nwaves settles at some distance from shore in deeper and quieter\r\nwater as a limy silt, and hardens into a dense, fine-grained\r\nlimestone in which perhaps no trace of fossil is found to suggest\r\nthe fact that it is of organic origin.\r\n\r\nFrom Florida Keys there extends south to the trough of Florida\r\nStraits a limestone bank covered by from five hundred and forty to\r\neighteen hundred feet of water. The rocky bottom consists of\r\nlimestone now slowly building from the accumulation of the remains\r\nof mollusks, small corals, sea urchins, worms with calcareous\r\ntubes, and lime-secreting seaweed, which live upon its surface.\r\n\r\nWhere sponges and other silica-secreting organisms abound on\r\nlimestone banks, silica forms part of the accumulated deposit,\r\neither in its original condition, as, for example, the spicules of\r\nsponges, or gathered into concretions and layers of flint.\r\n\r\nWhere considerable mud is being deposited along with carbonate of\r\nlime there is in process of making a clayey limestone or a limy\r\nshale; where considerable sand, a sandy limestone or a limy\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\nCONSOLIDATION OF OFFSHORE DEPOSITS. We cannot doubt that all these\r\nloose sediments of the sea floor are being slowly consolidated to\r\nsolid rock. They are soaked with water which carries in solution\r\nlime carbonate and other cementing substances. These cements are\r\ndeposited between the fragments of shells and corals, the grains\r\nof sand and the particles of mud, binding them together into firm\r\nrock. Where sediments have accumulated to great thickness the\r\nlower portions tend also to consolidate under the weight of the\r\noverlying beds. Except in the case of limestones, recent sea\r\ndeposits uplifted to form land are seldom so well cemented as are\r\nthe older strata, which have long been acted upon by underground\r\nwaters deep below the surface within the zone of cementation, and\r\nhave been exposed to view by great erosion.\r\n\r\nRIPPLE MARKS, SUN CRACKS, ETC. The pulse of waves and tidal\r\ncurrents agitates the loose material of offshore deposits,\r\nthrowing it into fine parallel ridges called ripple marks. One may\r\nsee this beautiful ribbing imprinted on beach sands uncovered by\r\nthe outgoing tide, and it is also produced where the water is of\r\nconsiderable depth. While the tide is out the surface of shore\r\ndeposits may be marked by the footprints of birds and other\r\nanimals, or by the raindrops of a passing shower.\r\n\r\nThe mud of flats, thus exposed to the sun and dried, cracks in a\r\ncharacteristic way. Such markings may be covered over with a thin\r\nlayer of sediment at the next flood tide and sealed away as a\r\nlasting record of the manner and place in which the strata were\r\nlaid. In Figure 150 we have an illustration of a very ancient\r\nripple-marked sand consolidated to hard stone, uplifted and set on\r\nedge by movements of the earth's crust, and exposed to open air\r\nafter long erosion.\r\n\r\nSTRATIFICATION. For the most part the sheet of sea-laid waste is\r\nhidden from our sight. Where its edge is exposed along the shore\r\nwe may see the surface markings which have just been noticed.\r\nSoundings also, and the observations made in shallow waters by\r\ndivers, tell something of its surface; but to learn more of its\r\nstructures we must study those ancient sediments which have been\r\nlifted from the sea and dissected by subaerial agencies. From them\r\nwe ascertain that sea deposits are stratified. They lie in\r\ndistinct layers which often differ from one another in thickness,\r\nin size of particles, and perhaps in color. They are parted by\r\nbedding planes, each of which represents either a change in\r\nmaterial or a pause during which deposition ceased and the\r\nmaterial of one layer had time to settle and become somewhat\r\nconsolidated before the material of the next was laid upon\r\nit. Stratification is thus due to intermittently acting forces,\r\nsuch as the agitation of the water during storms, the flow and ebb\r\nof the tide, and the shifting channels of tidal currents. Off the\r\nmouths of rivers, stratification is also caused by the coarser and\r\nmore abundant material brought down at time of floods being laid\r\non the finer silt which is discharged during ordinary stages.\r\n\r\nHow stratified deposits are built up is well illustrated in the\r\nflats which border estuaries, such as the Bay of Fundy. Each\r\nadvance of the tide spreads a film of mud, which dries and hardens\r\nin the air during low water before another film is laid upon it by\r\nthe next incoming tidal flood. In this way the flats have been\r\ncovered by a clay which splits into leaves as thin as sheets of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nIt is in fine material, such as clays and shales and limestones,\r\nthat the thinnest and most uniform layers, as well as those of\r\nwidest extent, occur. On the other hand, coarse materials are\r\ncommonly laid in thick beds, which soon thin out seaward and give\r\nplace to deposits of finer stuff. In a general way strata are laid\r\nin well-nigh horizontal sheets, for the surface on which they are\r\nlaid is generally of very gentle inclination. Each stratum,\r\nhowever, is lenticular, or lenslike, in form, having an area where\r\nit is thickest, and thinning out thence to its edges, where it is\r\noverlapped by strata similar in shape.\r\n\r\nCROSS BEDDING. There is an apparent exception to this rule where\r\nstrata whose upper and lower surfaces may be about horizontal are\r\nmade up of layers inclined at angles which may be as high as the\r\nangle of repose. In this case each stratum grew by the addition\r\nalong its edge of successive layers of sediment, precisely as does\r\na sand bar in a river, the sand being pushed continuously over the\r\nedge and coming to rest on a sloping surface. Shoals built by\r\nstrong and shifting tidal currents often show successive strata in\r\nwhich the cross bedding is inclined in different directions.\r\n\r\nTHICKNESS OF SEA DEPOSITS. Remembering the vast amount of\r\nmaterial denuded from the land and deposited offshore, we should\r\nexpect that with the lapse of time sea deposits would have grown\r\nto an enormous thickness. It is a suggestive fact that, as a rule,\r\nthe profile of the ocean bed is that of a soup plate,--a basin\r\nsurrounded by a flaring rim. On the CONTINENTAL SHELF, as the rim\r\nis called, the water is seldom more than six hundred feet in depth\r\nat the outer edge, and shallows gradually towards shore. Along the\r\neastern coast of the United States the continental shelf is from\r\nfifty to one hundred and more miles in width; on the Pacific coast\r\nit is much narrower. So far as it is due to upbuilding, a wide\r\ncontinental shelf, such as that of the Atlantic coast, implies a\r\nmassive continental delta thousands of feet in thickness. The\r\ncoastal plain of the Atlantic states may be regarded as the\r\nemerged inner margin of this shelf, and borings made along the\r\ncoast probe it to the depth of as much as three thousand feet\r\nwithout finding the bottom of ancient offshore deposits.\r\nContinental shelves may also be due in part to a submergence of\r\nthe outer margin of a continental plateau and to marine abrasion.\r\n\r\nDEPOSITION OF SEDIMENTS AND SUBSIDENCE. The stratified rocks of\r\nthe land show in many places ancient sediments which reach a\r\nthickness which is measured in miles, and which are yet the\r\nproduct of well-nigh continuous deposition. Such strata may prove\r\nby their fossils and by their composition and structure that they\r\nwere all laid offshore in shallow water. We must infer that,\r\nduring the vast length of time recorded by the enormous pile, the\r\nfloor of the sea along the coast was slowly sinking, and that the\r\ntrough was constantly being filled, foot by foot, as fast as it\r\nwas depressed. Such gradual, quiet movements of the earth's crust\r\nnot only modify the outline of coasts, as we have seen, but are of\r\nfar greater geological importance in that they permit the making\r\nof immense deposits of stratified rock.\r\n\r\nA slow subsidence continued during long time is recorded also in\r\nthe succession of the various kinds of rock that come to be\r\ndeposited in the same area. As the sea transgresses the land, i.e.\r\nencroaches upon it, any given part of the sea bottom is brought\r\nfarther and farther from the shore. The basal conglomerate formed\r\nby bowlder and pebble beaches comes to be covered with sheets of\r\nsand, and these with layers of mud as the sea becomes deeper and\r\nthe shore more remote; while deposits of limestone are made when\r\nat last no waste is brought to the place from the now distant\r\nland, and the water is left clear for the growth of mollusks and\r\nother lime-secreting organisms.\r\n\r\nRATE OF DEPOSITION. As deposition in the sea corresponds to\r\ndenudation on the land, we are able to make a general estimate of\r\nthe rate at which the former process is going on. Leaving out of\r\naccount the soluble matter removed, the Mississippi is lowering\r\nits basin at the rate of one foot in five thousand years, and we\r\nmay assume this as the average rate at which the earth's land\r\nsurface of fifty-seven million square miles is now being denuded\r\nby the removal of its mechanical waste. But sediments from the\r\nland are spread within a zone but two or three hundred miles in\r\nwidth along the margin of the continents, a line one hundred\r\nthousand miles long. As the area of deposition--about twenty-five\r\nmillion square miles--is about one half the area of denudation,\r\nthe average rate of deposition must be twice the average rate of\r\ndenudation, i.e. about one foot in twenty-five hundred years. If\r\nsome deposits are made much more rapidly than this, others are\r\nmade much more slowly. If they were laid no faster than the\r\npresent average rate, the strata of ancient sea deposits exposed\r\nin a quarry fifty feet deep represent a lapse of at least one\r\nhundred and twenty-five thousand years, and those of a formation\r\nfive hundred feet thick required for their accumulation one\r\nmillion two hundred and fifty thousand years.\r\n\r\nTHE SEDIMENTARY RECORD AND THE DENUDATION CYCLE. We have seen that\r\nthe successive stages in a cycle of denudation, such as that by\r\nwhich a land mass of lofty mountains is worn to low plains, are\r\nmarked each by its own peculiar land forms, and that the forms of\r\nthe earlier stages are more or less completely effaced as the\r\ncycle draws toward an end. Far more lasting records of each stage\r\nare left in the sedimentary deposits of the continental delta.\r\n\r\nThus, in the youth of such a land mass as we have mentioned,\r\ntorrential streams flowing down the steep mountain sides deliver\r\nto the adjacent sea their heavy loads of coarse waste, and thick\r\noffshore deposits of sand and gravel (Fig. 156) record the high\r\nelevation of the bordering land. As the land is worn to lower\r\nlevels, the amount and coarseness of the waste brought to the sea\r\ndiminishes, until the sluggish streams carry only a fine silt\r\nwhich settles on the ocean floor near to land in wide sheets of\r\nmud which harden into shale. At last, in the old age of the region\r\n(Fig. 157), its low plains contribute little to the sea except the\r\nsoluble elements of the rocks, and in the clear waters near the\r\nland lime-secreting organisms flourish and their remains\r\naccumulate in beds of limestone. When long-weathered lands\r\nmantled with deep, well-oxidized waste are uplifted by a gradual\r\nmovement of the earth's crust, and the mantle is rapidly stripped\r\noff by the revived streams, the uprise is recorded in wide\r\ndeposits of red and yellow clays and sands upon the adjacent ocean\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nWhere the waste brought in is more than the waves can easily\r\ndistribute, as off the mouths of turbid rivers which drain\r\nhighlands near the sea, deposits are little winnowed, and are laid\r\nin rapidly alternating, shaly sandstones and sandy shales.\r\n\r\nWhere the highlands are of igneous rock, such as granite, and\r\nmechanical disintegration is going on more rapidly than chemical\r\ndecay, these conditions are recorded in the nature of the deposits\r\nlaid offshore. The waste swept in by streams contains much\r\nfeldspar and other minerals softer and more soluble than quartz,\r\nand where the waves have little opportunity to wear and winnow it,\r\nit comes to rest in beds of sandstone in which grains of feldspar\r\nand other soft minerals are abundant. Such feldspathic sandstones\r\nare known as ARKOSE.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, where the waste supplied to the sea comes\r\nchiefly from wide, sandy, coastal plains, there are deposited off-\r\nshore clean sandstones of well-worn grains of quartz alone. In\r\nsuch coastal plains the waste of the land is stored for ages.\r\nAgain and again they are abandoned and invaded by the sea as from\r\ntime to time the land slowly emerges and is again submerged. Their\r\ndeposits are long exposed to the weather, and sorted over by the\r\nstreams, and winnowed and worked over again and again by the\r\nwaves. In the course of long ages such deposits thus become\r\nthoroughly sorted, and the grains of all minerals softer than\r\nquartz are ground to mud.\r\n\r\nDEEP-SEA OOZES AND CLAYS\r\n\r\nGLOBIGERINA OOZE. Beyond the reach of waste from the land the\r\nbottom of the deep sea is carpeted for the most part with either\r\nchalky ooze or a fine red clay. The surface waters of the warm\r\nseas swarm with minute and lowly animals belonging to the order of\r\nthe Foraminifera, which secrete shells of carbonate of lime. At\r\ndeath these tiny white shells fall through the sea water like\r\nsnowflakes in the air, and, slowly dissolving, seem to melt quite\r\naway before they can reach depths greater than about three miles.\r\nNear shore they reach bottom, but are masked by the rapid deposit\r\nof waste derived from the land. At intermediate depths they mantle\r\nthe ocean floor with a white, soft lime deposit known as\r\nGlobigerina ooze, from a genus of the Foraminifera which\r\ncontributes largely to its formation.\r\n\r\nRED CLAY. Below depths of from fifteen to eighteen thousand feet\r\nthe ocean bottom is sheeted with red or chocolate colored clay. It\r\nis the insoluble residue of seashells, of the debris of submarine\r\nvolcanic eruptions, of volcanic dust wafted by the winds, and of\r\npieces of pumice drifted by ocean currents far from the volcanoes\r\nfrom which they were hurled. The red clay builds up with such\r\ninconceivable slowness that the teeth of sharks and the hard ear\r\nbones of whales may be dredged in large numbers from the deep\r\nocean bed, where they have lain unburied for thousands of years;\r\nand an appreciable part of the clay is also formed by the dust of\r\nmeteorites consumed in the atmosphere,--a dust which falls\r\neverywhere on sea and land, but which elsewhere is wholly masked\r\nby other deposits.\r\n\r\nThe dark, cold abysses of the ocean are far less affected by\r\nchange than any other portion of the surface of the lithosphere.\r\nThese vast, silent plains of ooze lie far below the reach of\r\nstorms. They know no succession of summer and winter, or of night\r\nand day. A mantle of deep and quiet water protects them from the\r\nagents of erosion which continually attack, furrow, and destroy\r\nthe surface of the land. While the land is the area of erosion,\r\nthe sea is the area of deposition. The sheets of sediment which\r\nare slowly spread there tend to efface any inequalities, and to\r\nform a smooth and featureless subaqueous plain.\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions, the stratified rocks of the land are proved\r\nby their fossils and composition to have been laid in the sea; but\r\nin the same way they are proved to be offshore, shallow-water\r\ndeposits, akin to those now making on continental shelves. Deep-\r\nsea deposits are absent from the rocks of the land, and we may\r\ntherefore infer that the deep sea has never held sway where the\r\ncontinents now are,--that the continents have ever been, as now,\r\nthe elevated portions of the lithosphere, and that the deep seas\r\nof the present have ever been its most depressed portions.\r\n\r\nTHE REEF-BUILDING CORALS\r\n\r\nIn warm seas the most conspicuous of rock-making organisms are the\r\ncorals known as the reef builders. Floating in a boat over a coral\r\nreef, as, for example, off the south coast of Florida or among the\r\nBahamas, one looks down through clear water on thickets of\r\nbranching coral shrubs perhaps as much as eight feet high, and\r\nhemispherical masses three or four feet thick, all abloom with\r\ncountless minute flowerlike coral polyps, gorgeous in their colors\r\nof yellow, orange, green, and red. In structure each tiny polyp is\r\nlittle more than a fleshy sac whose mouth is surrounded with\r\npetal-like tentacles, or feelers. From the sea water the polyps\r\nsecrete calcium carbonate and build it up into the stony framework\r\nwhich supports their colonies. Boring mollusks, worms, and sponges\r\nperforate and honeycomb this framework even while its surface is\r\ncovered with myriads of living polyps. It is thus easily broken by\r\nthe waves, and white fragments of coral trees strew the ground\r\nbeneath. Brilliantly colored fishes live in these coral groves,\r\nand countless mollusks, sea urchins, and other forms of marine\r\nlife make here their home. With the debris from all these sources\r\nthe reef is constantly built up until it rises to low-tide level.\r\nHigher than this the corals cannot grow, since they are killed by\r\na few hours' exposure to the air.\r\n\r\nWhen the reef has risen to wave base, the waves abrade it on the\r\nwindward side and pile to leeward coral blocks torn from their\r\nfoundation, filling the interstices with finer fragments. Thus\r\nthey heap up along the reef low, narrow islands (Fig. 160).\r\n\r\nReef building is a comparatively rapid progress. It has been\r\nestimated that off Florida a reef could be built up to the surface\r\nfrom a depth of fifty feet in about fifteen hundred years.\r\n\r\nCORAL LIMESTONES. Limestones of various kinds are due to the reef\r\nbuilders. The reef rock is made of corals in place and broken\r\nfragments of all sizes, cemented together with calcium carbonate\r\nfrom solution by infiltrating waters. On the island beaches coral\r\nsand is forming oolitic limestone, and the white coral mud with\r\nwhich the sea is milky for miles about the reef in times of storm\r\nsettles and concretes into a compact limestone of finest grain.\r\nCorals have been among the most important limestone builders of\r\nthe sea ever since they made their appearance in the early\r\ngeological ages.\r\n\r\nThe areas on which coral limestone is now forming are large. The\r\nGreat Barrier Reef of Australia, which lies off the north-eastern\r\ncoast, is twelve hundred and fifty miles long, and has a width of\r\nfrom ten to ninety miles. Most of the islands of the tropics are\r\neither skirted with coral reefs or are themselves of coral\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS OF CORAL GROWTH. Reef-building corals cannot live\r\nexcept in clear salt water less, as a rule, than one hundred and\r\nfifty feet in depth, with a winter temperature not lower than 68\r\ndegrees F. An important condition also is an abundant food supply,\r\nand this is best secured in the path of the warm oceanic currents.\r\n\r\nCoral reefs may be grouped in three classes,--fringing reefs,\r\nbarrier reefs, and atolls.\r\n\r\nFRINGING REEFS. These take their name from the fact that they are\r\nattached as narrow fringes to the shore. An example is the reef\r\nwhich forms a selvage about a mile wide along the northeastern\r\ncoast of Cuba. The outer margin, indicated by the line of white\r\nsurf, where the corals are in vigorous growth, rises from about\r\nforty feet of water. Between this and the shore lies a stretch of\r\nshoal across which one can wade at low water, composed of coral\r\nsand with here and there a clump of growing coral.\r\n\r\nBARRIER REEFS. Reefs separated from the shore by a ship channel of\r\nquiet water, often several miles in width and sometimes as much as\r\nthree hundred feet in depth, are known as barrier reefs. The\r\nseaward face rises abruptly from water too deep for coral growth.\r\nLow islands are cast up by the waves upon the reef, and inlets\r\ngive place for the ebb and flow of the tides. Along the west coast\r\nof the island of New Caledonia a barrier reef extends for four\r\nhundred miles, and for a length of many leagues seldom approaches\r\nwithin eight miles of the shore.\r\n\r\nATOLLS. These are ring-shaped or irregular coral islands, or\r\nisland-studded reefs, inclosing a central lagoon. The narrow zone\r\nof land, like the rim of a great bowl sunken to the water's edge,\r\nrises hardly more than twenty feet at most above the sea, and is\r\ncovered with a forest of trees such as the cocoanut, whose seeds\r\ncan be drifted to it uninjured from long distances. The white\r\nbeach of coral sand leads down to the growing reef, on whose outer\r\nmargin the surf is constantly breaking. The sea face of the reef\r\nfalls off abruptly, often to depths of thousands of feet, while\r\nthe lagoon varies in depth from a few feet to one hundred and\r\nfifty or two hundred, and exceptionally measures as much as three\r\nhundred and fifty feet.\r\n\r\nTHEORIES OF CORAL REEFS. Fringing reefs require no explanation,\r\nsince the depth of water about them is not greater than that at\r\nwhich coral can grow; but barrier reefs and atolls, which may rise\r\nfrom depths too great for coral growth demand a theory of their\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nDarwin's theory holds that barrier reefs and atolls are formed\r\nfrom fringing reefs by SUBSIDENCE. The rate of sinking cannot be\r\ngreater than that of the upbuilding of the reef, since otherwise\r\nthe corals would be carried below their depth and drowned. The\r\nprocess is illustrated in Figure 161, where v represents a\r\nvolcanic island in mid ocean undergoing slow depression, and ss\r\nthe sea level before the sinking began, when the island was\r\nsurrounded by a fringing reef. As the island slowly sinks, the\r\nreef builds up with equal pace. It rears its seaward face more\r\nsteep than the island slope, and thus the intervening space\r\nbetween the sinking, narrowing land and the outer margin of the\r\nreef constantly widens. In this intervening space the corals are\r\nmore or less smothered with silt from the outer reef and from the\r\nland, and are also deprived in large measure of the needful supply\r\nof food and oxygen by the vigorous growth of the corals on the\r\nouter rim. The outer rim thus becomes a barrier reef and the inner\r\nbelt of retarded growth is deepened by subsidence to a ship\r\nchannel, s's' representing sea level at this time. The final\r\nstage, where the island has been carried completely beneath the\r\nsea and overgrown by the contracting reef, whose outer ring now\r\nforms an atoll, is represented by s\"s\".\r\n\r\nIn very many instances, however, atolls and barrier reefs may be\r\nexplained without subsidence. Thus a barrier reef may be formed by\r\nthe seaward growth of a fringing reef upon the talus of its sea\r\nface. In Figure 162 f is a fringing reef whose outer wall rises\r\nfrom about one hundred and fifty feet, the lower limit of the\r\nreef-building species. At the foot of this submarine cliff a talus\r\nof fallen blocks t accumulates, and as it reaches the zone of\r\ncoral growth becomes the foundation on which the reef is steadily\r\nextended seaward. As the reef widens, the polyps of the\r\ncircumference flourish, while those of the inner belt are retarded\r\nin their growth and at last perish. The coral rock of the inner\r\nbelt is now dissolved by sea water and scoured out by tidal\r\ncurrents until it gives place to a gradually deepening ship\r\nchannel, while the outer margin is left as a barrier reef.\r\n\r\nIn much the same way atolls may be built on any shoal which lies\r\nwithin the zone of coral growth. Such shoals may be produced when\r\nvolcanic islands are leveled by waves and ocean currents, and when\r\nsubmarine plateaus, ridges, and peaks are built up by various\r\norganic agencies, such as molluscous and foraminiferal shell\r\ndeposits. The reef-building corals, whose eggs are drifted widely\r\nover the tropic seas by ocean currents, colonize such submarine\r\nfoundations wherever the conditions are favorable for their\r\ngrowth. As the reef approaches the surface the corals of the inner\r\narea are smothered by silt and starved, and their Submarine\r\nVolcanic Peak hard parts are dissolved and scoured away; while\r\nthose of the circumference, with abundant food supply, nourish and\r\nbuild the ring of the atoll. Atolls may be produced also by the\r\nbackward drift of sand from either end of a crescentic coral reef\r\nor island, the spits uniting in the quiet water of the lee to\r\ninclose a lagoon. In the Maldive Archipelago all gradations\r\nbetween crescent-shaped islets and complete atoll rings have been\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nIn a number of instances where coral reefs have been raised by\r\nmovements of the earth's crust, the reef formation is found to be\r\na thin veneer built upon a foundation of other deposits. Thus\r\nChristmas Island, in the Indian Ocean, is a volcanic pile rising\r\neleven hundred feet above sea level and fifteen thousand five\r\nhundred feet above the bottom of the sea. The summit is a plateau\r\nsurrounded by a rim of hills of reef formation, which represent\r\nthe ring of islets of an ancient atoll. Beneath the reef are thick\r\nbeds of limestone, composed largely of the remains of\r\nforaminifers, which cover the lavas and fragraental materials of\r\nthe old submarine volcano.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient sediments which now form the stratified rocks of\r\nthe land there occur many thin reef deposits, but none are known\r\nof the immense thickness which modern reefs are supposed to reach\r\naccording to the theory of subsidence.\r\n\r\nBarrier and fringing reefs are commonly interrupted off the mouths\r\nof rivers. Why?\r\n\r\nSUMMARY. We have seen that the ocean bed is the goal to which the\r\nwaste of the rocks of the land at last arrives. Their soluble\r\nparts, dissolved by underground waters and carried to the sea by\r\nrivers, are largely built up by living creatures into vast sheets\r\nof limestone. The less soluble portions--the waste brought in by\r\nstreams and the waste of the shore--form the muds and sands of\r\ncontinental deltas. All of these sea deposits consolidate and\r\nharden, and the coherent rocks of the land are thus reconstructed\r\non the ocean floor. But the destination is not a final one. The\r\nstratified rocks of the land are for the most part ancient\r\ndeposits of the sea, which have been lifted above sea level; and\r\nwe may believe that the sediments now being laid offshore are the\r\n\"dust of continents to be,\" and will some time emerge to form\r\nadditions to the land. We are now to study the movements of the\r\nearth's crust which restore the sediments of the sea to the light\r\nof day, and to whose beneficence we owe the habitable lands of the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nINTERNAL GEOLOGICAL AGENCIES\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMOVEMENTS OF THE EARTH'S CRUST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geological agencies which we have so far studied--weathering,\r\nstreams, underground waters, glaciers, winds, and the ocean--all\r\nwork upon the earth from without, and all are set in motion by an\r\nenergy external to the earth, namely, the radiant energy of the\r\nsun. All, too, have a common tendency to reduce the inequalities\r\nof the earth's surface by leveling the lands and strewing their\r\nwaste beneath the sea.\r\n\r\nBut despite the unceasing efforts of these external agencies, they\r\nhave not destroyed the continents, which still rear their broad\r\nplains and great plateaus and mountain ranges above the sea.\r\nEither, then, the earth is very young and the agents of denudation\r\nhave not yet had time to do their work, or they have been opposed\r\nsuccessfully by other forces.\r\n\r\nWe enter now upon a department of our science which treats of\r\nforces which work upon the earth from within, and increase the\r\ninequalities of its surface. It is they which uplift and recreate\r\nthe lands which the agents of denudation are continually\r\ndestroying; it is they which deepen the ocean bed and thus\r\nwithdraw its waters from the shores. At times also these forces\r\nhave aided in the destruction of the lands by gradually lowering\r\nthem and bringing in the sea. Under the action of forces resident\r\nwithin the earth the crust slowly rises or sinks; from time to\r\ntime it has been folded and broken; while vast quantities of\r\nmolten rock have been pressed up into it from beneath and\r\noutpoured upon its surface. We shall take up these phenomena in\r\nthe following chapters, which treat of upheavals and depressions\r\nof the crust, foldings and fractures of the crust, earthquakes,\r\nvolcanoes, the interior conditions of the earth, mineral veins,\r\nand metamorphism.\r\n\r\nOSCILLATIONS OF THE CRUST\r\n\r\nOf the various movements of the crust due to internal agencies we\r\nwill consider first those called oscillations, which lift or\r\ndepress large areas so slowly that a long time is needed to\r\nproduce perceptible changes of level, and which leave the strata\r\nin nearly their original horizontal attitude. These movements are\r\nmost conspicuous along coasts, where they can be referred to the\r\ndatum plane of sea level; we will therefore take our first\r\nillustrations from rising and sinking shores.\r\n\r\nNEW JERSEY. Along the coasts of New Jersey one may find awash at\r\nhigh tide ancient shell heaps, the remains of tribal feasts of\r\naborigines. Meadows and old forest grounds, with the stumps still\r\nstanding, are now overflowed by the sea, and fragments of their\r\nturf and wood are brought to shore by waves. Assuming that the sea\r\nlevel remains constant, it is clear that the New Jersey coast is\r\nnow gradually sinking. The rate of submergence has been estimated\r\nat about two feet per century.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the wide coastal plain of New Jersey is made of\r\nstratified sands and clays, which, as their marine fossils show,\r\nwere outspread beneath the sea. Their present position above sea\r\nlevel proves that the land now subsiding emerged in the recent\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThe coast of New Jersey is an example of the slow and tranquil\r\noscillations of the earth's unstable crust now in progress along\r\nmany shores. Some are emerging from the sea, some are sinking\r\nbeneath it; and no part of the land seems to have been exempt from\r\nthese changes in the past.\r\n\r\nEVIDENCES OF CHANGES OF LEVEL. Taking the surface of the sea as a\r\nlevel of reference, we may accept as proofs of relative upheaval\r\nwhatever is now found in place above sea level and could have been\r\nformed only at or beneath it, and as proofs of relative subsidence\r\nwhatever is now found beneath the sea and could only have been\r\nformed above it.\r\n\r\nThus old strand lines with sea cliffs, wave-cut rock benches, and\r\nbeaches of wave-worn pebbles or sand, are striking proofs of\r\nrecent emergence to the amount of their present height above tide.\r\nNo less conclusive is the presence of sea-laid rocks which we may\r\nfind in the neighboring quarry or outcrop, although it may have\r\nbeen long ages since they were lifted from the sea to form part of\r\nthe dry land.\r\n\r\nAmong common proofs of subsidence are roads and buildings and\r\nother works of man, and vegetal growths and deposits, such as\r\nforest grounds and peat beds, now submerged beneath the sea. In\r\nthe deltas of many large rivers, such as the Po, the Nile, the\r\nGanges, and the Mississippi, buried soils prove subsidences of\r\nhundreds of feet; and in several cases, as in the Mississippi\r\ndelta, the depression seems to be now in progress.\r\n\r\nOther proofs of the same movement are drowned land forms which are\r\nmodeled only in open air. Since rivers cannot cut their valleys\r\nfarther below the baselevel of the sea than the depths of their\r\nchannels, DROWNED VALLEYS are among the plainest proofs of\r\ndepression. To this class belong Narragansett, Delaware,\r\nChesapeake, Mobile, and San Francisco bays, and many other similar\r\ndrowned valleys along the coasts of the United States. Less\r\nconspicuous are the SUBMARINE CHANNELS which, as soundings show,\r\nextend from the mouths of a number of rivers some distance out to\r\nsea. Such is the submerged channel which reaches from New York Bay\r\nsoutheast to the edge of the continental shelf, and which is\r\nsupposed to have been cut by the Hudson River when this part of\r\nthe shelf was a coastal plain.\r\n\r\nWARPING. In a region undergoing changes of level the rate of\r\nmovement commonly varies in different parts. Portions of an area\r\nmay be rising or sinking, while adjacent portions are stationary\r\nor moving in the opposite direction. In this way a land surface\r\nbecomes WARPED. Thus, while Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are now\r\nrising from the level of the sea, Prince Edward Island and Cape\r\nBreton Island are sinking, and the sea now flows over the site of\r\nthe famous old town of Louisburg destroyed in 1758.\r\n\r\nSince the close of the glacial epoch the coasts of Newfoundland\r\nand Labrador have risen hundreds of feet, but the rate of\r\nemergence has not been uniform. The old strand line, which stands\r\nat five hundred and seventy-five feet above tide at St. John's,\r\nNewfoundland, declines to two hundred and fifty feet near the\r\nnorthern point of Labrador.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT LAKES is now under-going perceptible warping. Rivers\r\nenter the lakes from the south and west with sluggish currents and\r\ndeep channels resembling the estuaries of drowned rivers; while\r\nthose that enter from opposite directions are swift and shallow.\r\nAt the western end of Lake Erie are found submerged caves\r\ncontaining stalactites, and old meadows and forest grounds are now\r\nunder water. It is thus seen that the water of the lakes is rising\r\nalong their southwestern shores, while from their north-eastern\r\nshores it is being withdrawn. The region of the Great Lakes is\r\ntherefore warping; it is rising in the northeast as compared with\r\nthe southwest.\r\n\r\nFrom old bench marks and records of lake levels it has been\r\nestimated that the rate of warping amounts to five inches a\r\ncentury for every one hundred miles. It is calculated that the\r\nwater of Lake Michigan is rising at Chicago at the rate of nine or\r\nten inches per century. The divide at this point between the\r\ntributaries of the Mississippi and Lake Michigan is but eight feet\r\nabove the mean stage of the lake. If the canting of the region\r\ncontinues at its present rate, in a thousand years the waters of\r\nthe lake will here overflow the divide. In three thousand five\r\nhundred years all the lakes except Ontario will discharge by this\r\noutlet, via the Illinois and Mississippi rivers, into the Gulf of\r\nMexico. The present outlet by the Niagara River will be left dry,\r\nand the divide between the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi\r\nsystems will have shifted from Chicago to the vicinity of Buffalo.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOGRAPHIC EFFECTS OF OSCILLATIONS. We have already mentioned\r\nseveral of the most important effects of movements of elevation\r\nand depression, such as their effects on rivers, the mantle of\r\nwaste, and the forms of coasts. Movements of elevation--including\r\nuplifts by folding and fracture of the crust to be noticed later--\r\nare the necessary conditions for erosion by whatever agent. They\r\ndetermine the various agencies which are to be chiefly concerned m\r\nthe wear of any land,--whether streams or glaciers, weathering or\r\nthe wind,--and the degree of their efficiency. The lands must be\r\nuplifted before they can be eroded, and since they must be eroded\r\nbefore their waste can be deposited, movements of elevation are a\r\nprerequisite condition for sedimentation also. Subsidence is a\r\nnecessary condition for deposits of great thickness, such as those\r\nof the Great Valley of California and the Indo-Gangetic plain (p.\r\n101), the Mississippi delta (p. 109), and the still more important\r\nformations of the continental delta in gradually sinking troughs\r\n(p. 183). It is not too much to say that the character and\r\nthickness of each formation of the stratified rocks depend\r\nprimarily on these crustal movements.\r\n\r\nAlong the Baltic coast of Sweden, bench marks show that the sea is\r\nwithdrawing from the land at a rate which at the north amounts to\r\nbetween three and four feet per century; Towards the south the\r\nrate decreases. South of Stockholm, until recent years, the sea\r\nhas gained upon the land, and here in several seaboard towns\r\nstreets by the shore are still submerged. The rate of oscillation\r\nincreases also from the coast inland. On the other hand, along the\r\nGerman coast of the Baltic the only historic fluctuations of sea\r\nlevel are those which may be accounted for by variations due to\r\nchanges in rainfall. In 1730 Celsius explained the changes of\r\nlevel of the Swedish coast as due to a lowering of the Baltic\r\ninstead of to an elevation of the land. Are the facts just stated\r\nconsistent with his theory?\r\n\r\nAt the little town of Tadousac--where the Saguenay River empties\r\ninto the St. Lawrence--there are terraces of old sea beaches, some\r\nalmost as fresh as recent railway fills, the highest standing two\r\nhundred and thirty feet above the river. Here the Saguenay is\r\neight hundred and forty feet in depth, and the tide ebbs and flows\r\nfar up its stream. Was its channel cut to this depth by the river\r\nwhen the land was at its present height? What oscillations are\r\nhere recorded, and to what amount?\r\n\r\nA few miles north of Naples, Italy, the ruins of an ancient Roman\r\ntemple lie by the edge of the sea, on a narrow plain which is\r\noverlooked in the rear by an old sea cliff (Fig. 166). Three\r\nmarble pillars are still standing. For eleven feet above their\r\nbases these columns are uninjured, for to this height they were\r\nprotected by an accumulation of volcanic ashes; but from eleven to\r\nnineteen feet they are closely pitted with the holes of boring\r\nmarine mollusks. From these facts trace the history of the\r\noscillations of the region.\r\n\r\nFOLDINGS OF THE CRUST\r\n\r\nThe oscillations which we have just described leave the strata not\r\nfar from their original horizontal attitude. Figure 167 represents\r\na region in which movements of a very different nature have taken\r\nplace. Here, on either side of the valley V, we find outcrops of\r\nlayers tilted at high angles. Sections along the ridge r show that\r\nit is composed of layers which slant inward from either side. In\r\nplaces the outcropping strata stand nearly on edge, and on the\r\nright of the valley they are quite overturned; a shale SH has come\r\nto overlie a limestone LM although the shale is the older rock,\r\nwhose original position was beneath the limestone.\r\n\r\nIt is not reasonable to suppose that these rocks were deposited in\r\nthe attitude in which we find them now; we must believe that, like\r\nother stratified rocks, they were outspread in nearly level sheets\r\nupon the ocean floor. Since that time they must have been\r\ndeformed. Layers of solid rock several miles in thickness have\r\nbeen crumpled and folded like soft wax in the hand, and a vast\r\ndenudation has worn away the upper portions of the folds, in part\r\nrepresented in our section by dotted lines.\r\n\r\nDIP AND STRIKE. In districts where the strata have been disturbed\r\nit is desirable to record their attitude. This is most easily done\r\nby taking the angle at which the strata are inclined and the\r\ncompass direction in which they slant. It is also convenient to\r\nrecord the direction in which the outcrop of the strata trends\r\nacross the country.\r\n\r\nThe inclination of a bed of rocks to the horizon is its DIP. The\r\namount of the dip is the angle made with a horizontal plane. The\r\ndip of a horizontal layer is zero, and that of a vertical layer is\r\n90 degrees. The direction of the dip is taken with the compass.\r\nThus a geologist's notebook in describing the attitude of\r\noutcropping strata contains many such entries as these: dip 32\r\ndegrees north, or dip 8 degrees south 20 degrees west,--meaning in\r\nthe latter case that the amount of the dip is 8 degrees and the\r\ndirection of the dip bears 20 degrees west of south.\r\n\r\nThe line of intersection of a layer with the horizontal plane is\r\nthe STRIKE. The strike always runs at right angles to the dip.\r\n\r\nDip and strike may be illustrated by a book set aslant on a shelf.\r\nThe dip is the acute angle made with the shelf by the side of the\r\nbook, while the strike is represented by a line running along the\r\nbook's upper edge. If the dip is north or south, the strike runs\r\neast and west.\r\n\r\nFOLDED STRUCTURES. An upfold, in which the strata dip away from a\r\nline drawn along the crest and called the axis of the fold, is\r\nknown as an ANTICLINE. A downfold, where the strata dip from\r\neither side toward the axis of the trough, is called a SYNCLINE.\r\nThere is sometimes seen a downward bend in horizontal or gently\r\ninclined strata, by which they descend to a lower level. Such a\r\nsingle flexure is a MONOCLINE.\r\n\r\nDEGREES OF FOLDING. Folds vary in degree from broad, low swells,\r\nwhich can hardly be detected, to the most highly contorted and\r\ncomplicated structures. In SYMMETRIC folds the dips of the rocks\r\non each side the axis of the fold are equal. In UNSYMMETRICAL\r\nfolds one limb is steeper than the other, as in the anticline in\r\nFigure 167. In OVERTURNED folds one limb is inclined beyond the\r\nperpendicular. FAN FOLDS have been so pinched that the original\r\nanticlines are left broader at the top than at the bottom.\r\n\r\nIn folds where the compression has been great the layers are often\r\nfound thickened at the crest and thinned along the limbs. Where\r\nstrong rocks such as heavy limestones are folded together with\r\nweak rocks such as shales, the strong rocks are often bent into\r\ngreat simple folds, while the weak rocks are minutely crumpled.\r\n\r\nSYSTEMS OF FOLDS. As a rule, folds occur in systems. Over the\r\nAppalachian mountain belt, for example, extending from\r\nnortheastern Pennsylvania to northern Alabama and Georgia, the\r\nearth's crust has been thrown into a series of parallel folds\r\nwhose axes run from northeast to southwest (Fig. 175). In\r\nPennsylvania one may count a score or more of these earth waves,--\r\nsome but from ten to twenty miles in length, and some extending as\r\nmuch as two hundred miles before they die away. On the eastern\r\npart of this belt the folds are steeper and more numerous than on\r\nthe western side.\r\n\r\nCAUSE AND CONDITIONS OF FOLDING. The sections which we have\r\nstudied suggest that rocks are folded by lateral pressure. While a\r\nsingle, simple fold might be produced by a heave, a series of\r\nfolds, including overturns, fan folds, and folds thickened on\r\ntheir crests at the expense of their limbs, could only be made in\r\none way,--by pressure from the side. Experiment has reproduced all\r\nforms of folds by subjecting to lateral thrust layers of plastic\r\nmaterial such as wax.\r\n\r\nVast as the force must have been which could fold the solid rocks\r\nof the crust as one may crumple the leaves of a magazine in the\r\nfingers, it is only under certain conditions that it could have\r\nproduced the results which we see. Rocks are brittle, and it is\r\nonly when under a HEAVY LOAD and by GREAT PRESSURE SLOWLY APPLIED,\r\nthat they can thus be folded and bent instead of being crushed to\r\npieces. Under these conditions, experiments prove that not only\r\nmetals such as steel, but also brittle rocks such as marble, can\r\nbe deformed and molded and made to flow like plastic clay.\r\n\r\nZONE OF FLOW, ZONE OF FLOW AND FRACTURE, AND ZONE OF FRACTURE. We\r\nmay believe that at depths which must be reckoned in tens of\r\nthousands of feet the load of overlying rocks is so great that\r\nrocks of all kinds yield by folding to lateral pressure, and flow\r\ninstead of breaking. Indeed, at such profound depths and under\r\nsuch inconceivable weight no cavity can form, and any fractures\r\nwould be healed at once by the welding of grain to grain. At less\r\ndepths there exists a zone where soft rocks fold and flow under\r\nstress, and hard rocks are fractured; while at and near the\r\nsurface hard and soft rocks alike yield by fracture to strong\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURES DEVELOPED IN COMPRESSED ROCKS\r\n\r\nDeformed rocks show the effects of the stresses to which they have\r\nyielded, not only in the immense folds into which they have been\r\nthrown but in their smallest parts as well. A hand specimen of\r\nslate, or even a particle under the microscope, may show\r\nplications similar in form and origin to the foldings which have\r\nproduced ranges of mountains. A tiny flake of mica in the rocks of\r\nthe Alps may be puckered by the same resistless forces which have\r\nfolded miles of solid rock to form that lofty range.\r\n\r\nSLATY CLEAVAGE. Rocks which have yielded to pressure often split\r\neasily in a certain direction across the bedding planes. This\r\ncleavage is known as slaty cleavage, since it is most perfectly\r\ndeveloped in fine-grained, homogeneous rocks, such as slates,\r\nwhich cleave to the thin, smooth-surfaced plates with which we are\r\nfamiliar in the slates used in roofing and for ciphering and\r\nblackboards. In coarse-grained rocks, pressure develops more\r\ndistant partings which separate the rocks into blocks.\r\n\r\nSlaty cleavage cannot be due to lamination, since it commonly\r\ncrosses bedding planes at an angle, while these planes have been\r\noften well-nigh or quite obliterated. Examining slate with a\r\nmicroscope, we find that its cleavage is due to the grain of the\r\nrock. Its particles are flattened and lie with their broad faces\r\nin parallel planes, along which the rock naturally splits more\r\neasily than in any other direction. The irregular grains of the\r\nmud which has been altered to slate have been squeezed flat by a\r\npressure exerted at right angles to the plane of cleavage.\r\nCleavage is found only in folded rocks, and, as we may see in\r\nFigure 176, the strike of the cleavage runs parallel to the strike\r\nof the strata and the axis of the folds. The dip of the cleavage\r\nis generally steep, hence the pressure was nearly horizontal. The\r\npressure which has acted at right angles to the cleavage, and to\r\nwhich it is due, is the same lateral pressure which has thrown the\r\nstrata into folds.\r\n\r\nWe find additional proof that slates have undergone compression at\r\nright angles to their cleavage in the fact that any inclusions in\r\nthem, such as nodules and fossils, have been squeezed out of shape\r\nand have their long diameters lying in the planes of cleavage.\r\n\r\nThat pressure is competent to cause cleavage is shown by\r\nexperiment. Homogeneous material of fine grain, such as beeswax,\r\nwhen subjected to heavy pressure cleaves at right angles to the\r\ndirection of the compressing force.\r\n\r\nRATE OF FOLDING. All the facts known with regard to rock\r\ndeformation agree that it is a secular process, taking place so\r\nslowly that, like the deepening of valleys by erosion, it escapes\r\nthe notice of the inhabitants of the region. It is only under\r\nstresses slowly applied that rocks bend without breaking. The\r\nfolds of some of the highest mountains have risen so gradually\r\nthat strong, well-intrenched rivers which had the right of way\r\nacross the region were able to hold to their courses, and as a\r\ncircular saw cuts its way through the log which is steadily driven\r\nagainst it, so these rivers sawed their gorges through the fold as\r\nfast as it rose beneath them. Streams which thus maintain the\r\ncourse which they had antecedent to a deformation of the region\r\nare known as ANTECEDENT streams. Examples of such are the Sutlej\r\nand other rivers of India, whose valleys trench the outer ranges\r\nof the Himalayas and whose earlier river deposits have been\r\nupturned by the rising ridges. On the other hand, mountain crests\r\nare usually divides, parting the head waters of different drainage\r\nsystems. In these cases the original streams of the region have\r\nbeen broken or destroyed by the uplift of the mountain mass across\r\ntheir paths.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, which have worked more rapidly, processes of\r\ndeformation or of denudation?\r\n\r\nLAND FORMS DUE TO FOLDING\r\n\r\nAs folding goes on so slowly, it is never left to form surface\r\nfeatures unmodified by the action of other agencies. An anticlinal\r\nfold is attacked by erosion as soon as it begins to rise above the\r\noriginal level, and the higher it is uplifted, and the stronger\r\nare its slopes, the faster is it worn away. Even while rising, a\r\nyoung upfold is often thus unroofed, and instead of appearing as a\r\nlong, Smooth, boat-shaped ridge, it commonly has had opened along\r\nthe rocks of the axis, when these are weak, a valley which is\r\noverlooked by the infacing escarpments of the hard layers of the\r\nsides of the fold. Under long-continued erosion, anticlines may be\r\ndegraded to valleys, while the synclines of the same system may be\r\nleft in relief as ridges.\r\n\r\nFOLDED MOUNTAINS. The vastness of the forces which wrinkle the\r\ncrust is best realized in the presence of some lofty mountain\r\nrange. All mountains, indeed, are not the result of folding. Some,\r\nas we shall see, are due to upwarps or to fractures of the crust;\r\nsome are piles of volcanic material; some are swellings caused by\r\nthe intrusion of molten matter beneath the surface; some are the\r\nrelicts left after the long denudation of high plateaus.\r\n\r\nBut most of the mountain ranges of the earth, and some of the\r\ngreatest, such as the Alps and the Himalayas, were originally\r\nmountains of folding. The earth's crust has wrinkled into a fold;\r\nor into a series of folds, forming a series of parallel ridges and\r\nintervening valleys; or a number of folds have been mashed\r\ntogether into a vast upswelling of the crust, in which the layers\r\nhave been so crumpled and twisted, overturned and crushed, that it\r\nis exceedingly difficult to make out the original structure.\r\n\r\nThe close and intricate folds seen in great mountain ranges were\r\nformed, as we have seen, deep below the surface, within the zone\r\nof folding. Hence they may never have found expression in any\r\nindividual surface features. As the result of these deformations\r\ndeep under ground the surface was broadly lifted to mountain\r\nheight, and the crumpled and twisted mountain structures are now\r\nto be seen only because erosion has swept away the heavy cover of\r\nsurface rocks under whose load they were developed.\r\n\r\nWhen the structure of mountains has been deciphered it is possible\r\nto estimate roughly the amount of horizontal compression which the\r\nregion has suffered. If the strata of the folds of the Alps were\r\nsmoothed out, they would occupy a belt seventy-four miles wider\r\nthan that to which they have been compressed, or twice their\r\npresent width. A section across the Appalachian folds in\r\nPennyslvania shows a compression to about two thirds the original\r\nwidth; the belt has been shortened thirty-five miles in every\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nConsidering the thickness of their strata, the compression which\r\nmountains have undergone accounts fully for their height, with\r\nenough to spare for all that has been lost by denudation.\r\n\r\nThe Appalachian folds involve strata thirty thousand feet in\r\nthickness. Assuming that the folded strata rested on an unyielding\r\nfoundation, and that what was lost in width was gained in height,\r\nwhat elevation would the range have reached had not denudation\r\nworn it as it rose?\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE HISTORY OF MOUNTAINS. While the disturbance and uplift of\r\nmountain masses are due to deformation, their sculpture into\r\nridges and peaks, valleys and deep ravines, and all the forms\r\nwhich meet the eye in mountain scenery, excepting in the very\r\nyoungest ranges, is due solely to erosion. We may therefore\r\nclassify mountains according to the degree to which they have been\r\ndissected. The Juras are an example of the stage of early youth,\r\nin which the anticlines still persist as ridges and the synclines\r\ncoincide with the valleys; this they owe as much to the slight\r\nheight of their uplift as to the recency of its date.\r\n\r\nThe Alps were upheaved at various times, the last uplift being\r\nlater than the uplift of the Juras, but to so much greater height\r\nthat erosion has already advanced them well on towards maturity.\r\nThe mountain mass has been cut to the core, revealing strange\r\ncontortions of strata which could never have found expression at\r\nthe surface. Sharp peaks, knife-edged crests, deep valleys with\r\nungraded slopes subject to frequent landslides, are all features\r\nof Alpine scenery typical of a mountain range at this stage in its\r\nlife history. They represent the survival of the hardest rocks and\r\nthe strongest structures, and the destruction of the weaker in\r\ntheir long struggle for existence against the agents of erosion.\r\nAlthough miles of rock have been removed from such ranges as the\r\nAlps, we need not suppose that they ever stood much, if any,\r\nhigher than at present. All this vast denudation may easily have\r\nbeen accomplished while their slow upheaval was going on; in\r\nseveral mountain ranges we have evidence that elevation has not\r\nyet ceased.\r\n\r\nUnder long denudation mountains are subdued to the forms\r\ncharacteristic of old age. The lofty peaks and jagged crests of\r\ntheir earlier life are smoothed down to low domes and rounded\r\ncrests. The southern Appalachians and portions of the Hartz\r\nMountains in Germany are examples of mountains which have reached\r\nthis stage.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous regions of upland and plains in which the rocks\r\nare found to have the same structure that we have seen in folded\r\nmountains; they are tilted, crumpled, and overturned, and have\r\nclearly suffered intense compression. We may infer that their\r\nfolds were once lifted to the height of mountains and have since\r\nbeen wasted to low-lying lands. Such a section as that of Figure\r\n67 illustrates how ancient mountains may be leveled to their\r\nroots, and represents the final stage to which even the Alps and\r\nthe Himalayas must sometime arrive. Mountains, perhaps of Alpine\r\nheight, once stood about Lake Superior; a lofty range once\r\nextended from New England and New Jersey southwestward to Georgia\r\nalong the Piedmont belt. In our study of historic geology we shall\r\nsee more clearly how short is the life of mountains as the earth\r\ncounts time, and how great ranges have been lifted, worn away, and\r\nagain upheaved into a new cycle of erosion.\r\n\r\nTHE SEDIMENTARY HISTORY OF FOLDED MOUNTAINS. We may mention here\r\nsome of the conditions which have commonly been antecedent to\r\ngreat foldings of the crust.\r\n\r\n1. Mountain ranges are made of belts of enormously and\r\nexceptionally thick sediments. The strata of the Appalachians are\r\nthirty thousand feet thick, while the same formations thin out to\r\nfive thousand feet in the Mississippi valley. The folds of the\r\nWasatch Mountains involve strata thirty thousand feet thick, which\r\nthin to two thousand feet in the region of the Plains.\r\n\r\n2. The sedimentary strata of which mountains are made are for the\r\nmost part the shallow-water deposits of continental deltas.\r\nMountain ranges have been upfolded along the margins of\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\n3. Shallow-water deposits of the immense thickness found in\r\nmountain ranges can be laid only in a gradually sinking area. A\r\nprofound subsidence, often to be reckoned in tens of thousands of\r\nfeet, precedes the upfolding of a mountain range.\r\n\r\nThus the history of mountains of folding is as follows: For long\r\nages the sea bottom off the coast of a continent slowly subsides,\r\nand the great trough, as fast as it forms, is filled with\r\nsediments, which at last come to be many thousands of feet thick.\r\nThe downward movement finally ceases. A slow but resistless\r\npressure sets in, and gradually, and with a long series of many\r\nintermittent movements, the vast mass of accumulated sediments is\r\ncrumpled and uplifted into a mountain range.\r\n\r\nFRACTURES AND DISLOCATIONS OF THE CRUST\r\n\r\nConsidering the immense stresses to which the rocks of the crust\r\nare subjected, it is not surprising to find that they often yield\r\nby fracture, like brittle bodies, instead of by folding and\r\nflowing, like plastic solids. Whether rocks bend or break depends\r\non the character and condition of the rocks, the load of overlying\r\nrocks which they bear, and the amount of the force and the\r\nslowness with which it is applied.\r\n\r\nJOINTS. At the surface, where their load is least, we find rocks\r\nuniversally broken into blocks of greater or less size by partings\r\nknown as joints. Under this name are included many division planes\r\ncaused by cooling and drying; but it is now generally believed\r\nthat the larger and more regular joints, especially those which\r\nrun parallel to the dip and strike of the strata, are fractures\r\ndue to up-and-down movements and foldings and twistings of the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nJoints are used to great advantage in quarrying, and we have seen\r\nhow they are utilized by the weather in breaking up rock masses,\r\nby rivers in widening their valleys, by the sea in driving back\r\nits cliffs, by glaciers in plucking their beds, and how they are\r\nenlarged in soluble rocks to form natural passageways for\r\nunderground waters. The ends of the parted strata match along both\r\nsides of joint planes; in. joints there has been little or no\r\ndisplacement of the broken rocks.\r\n\r\nFAULTS. In Figure 184 the rocks have been both broken and\r\ndislocated along the plane ff'. One side must have been moved up\r\nor down past the other. Such a dislocation is called a fault. The\r\namount of the displacement, as measured by the vertical distance\r\nbetween the ends of a parted layer, is the throw. The angle which\r\nthe fault plane makes with the vertical is the HADE. In Figure 184\r\nthe right side has gone down relatively to the left; the right is\r\nthe side of the downthrow, while the left is the side of the\r\nupthrow. Where the fault plane is not vertical the surfaces on the\r\ntwo sides may be distinguished as the HANGING WALL and the FOOT\r\nWALL. Faults differ in throw from a fraction of an inch to many\r\nthousands of feet.\r\n\r\nSLICKENSIDES. If we examine the walls of a fault, we may find\r\nfurther evidence of movement in the fact that the surfaces are\r\npolished and grooved by the enormous friction which they have\r\nsuffered as they have ground one upon the other. These\r\nappearances, called sliekensides, have sometimes been mistaken for\r\nthe results of glacial action.\r\n\r\nNORMAL FAULTS. Faults are of two kinds,--normal faults and thrust\r\nfaults. Normal faults, of which Figure 184 is an example, hade to\r\nthe downthrow; the hanging wall has gone down. The total length of\r\nthe strata has been increased by the displacement. It seems that\r\nthe strata have been stretched and broken, and that the blocks\r\nhave readjusted themselves under the action of gravity as they\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nTHRUST FAULTS. Thrust faults hade to the upthrow; the hanging wall\r\nhas gone up. Clearly such faults, where the strata occupy less\r\nspace than before, are due to lateral thrust. Folds and thrust\r\nfaults are closely associated. Under lateral pressure strata may\r\nfold to a certain point and then tear apart and fault along the\r\nsurface of least resistance. Under immense pressure strata also\r\nbreak by shear without folding. Thus, in Figure 185, the rigid\r\nearth block under lateral thrust has found it easier to break\r\nalong the fault plane than to fold. Where such faults are nearly\r\nhorizontal they are distinguished as THRUST PLANES.\r\n\r\nIn all thrust faults one mass has been pushed over another, so as\r\nto bring the underlying and older strata upon younger beds; and\r\nwhen the fault planes are nearly horizontal, and especially when\r\nthe rocks have been broken into many slices which have slidden far\r\none upon another, the true succession of strata is extremely hard\r\nto decipher.\r\n\r\nIn the Selkirk Mountains of Canada the basement rocks of the\r\nregion have been driven east for seven miles on a thrust plane,\r\nover rocks which originally lay thousands of feet above them.\r\n\r\nAlong the western Appalachians, from Virginia to Georgia, the\r\nmountain folds are broken by more than fifteen parallel thrust\r\nplanes, running from northeast to southwest, along which the older\r\nstrata have been pushed westward over the younger. The longest\r\ncontinuous fault has been traced three hundred and seventy-five\r\nmiles, and the greatest horizontal displacement has been estimated\r\nat not less than eleven miles.\r\n\r\nCRUSH BRECCIA. Rocks often do not fault with a clean and simple\r\nfracture, but along a zone, sometimes several yards in width, in\r\nwhich they are broken to fragments. It may occur also that strata\r\nwhich as a whole yield to lateral thrust by folding include beds\r\nof brittle rocks, such as thin-layered limestones, which are\r\ncrushed to pieces by the strain. In either case the fragments when\r\nrecemented by percolating waters form a rock known as a CRUSH\r\nBRECCIA (pronounced BRETCHA).\r\n\r\nBreccia is a term applied to any rock formed of cemented ANGULAR\r\nfragments. This rock may be made by the consolidation of volcanic\r\ncinders, of angular waste at the foot of cliffs, or of fragments\r\nof coral torn by the waves from coral reefs, as well as of strata\r\ncrushed by crustal movements.\r\n\r\nSURFACE FEATURES DUE TO DISLOCATIONS\r\n\r\nFAULT SCARPS. A fault of recent date may be marked at surface by a\r\nscarp, because the face of the upthrown block has not yet been\r\nworn to the level of the downthrow side.\r\n\r\nAfter the upthrown block has been worn down to this level,\r\ndifferential erosion produces fault scarps wherever weak rocks and\r\nresistant rocks are brought in contact along the fault plane; and\r\nthe harder rocks, whether on the upthrow or the downthrow side,\r\nemerge in a line of cliffs. Where a fault is so old that no abrupt\r\nscarps appear, its general course is sometimes marked by the line\r\nof division between highland and lowland or hill and plain. Great\r\nfaults have sometimes brought ancient crystalline rocks in contact\r\nwith weaker and younger sedimentary rocks, and long after erosion\r\nhas destroyed all fault scarps the harder crystallines rise in an\r\nupland of rugged or mountainous country which meets the lowland\r\nalong the line of faulting.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of faults give rise to no surface features. The\r\nfaulted region may be old enough to have been baseleveled, or the\r\nrocks on both sides of the line of dislocation may be alike in\r\ntheir resistance to erosion and therefore have been worn down to a\r\ncommon slope. The fault may be entirely concealed by the mantle of\r\nwaste, and in such cases it can be inferred from abrupt changes in\r\nthe character or the strike and dip of the strata where they may\r\noutcrop near it.\r\n\r\nThe plateau trenched by the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River\r\nexhibits a series of magnificent fault scarps whose general course\r\nis from north to south, marking the edges of the great crust\r\nblocks into which the country has been broken. The highest part of\r\nthe plateau is a crust block ninety miles long and thirty-five\r\nmiles in maximum width, which has been hoisted to nine thousand\r\nthree hundred feet above, sea level. On the east it descends four\r\nthousand feet by a monoclinal fold, which passes into a fault\r\ntowards the north. On the west it breaks down by a succession of\r\nterraces faced by fault scarps. The throw of these faults varies\r\nfrom seven hundred feet to more than a mile. The escarpments,\r\nhowever, are due in a large degree to the erosion of weaker rock\r\non the downthrow side.\r\n\r\nThe Highlands of Scotland meet the Lowlands on the south with a\r\nbold front of rugged hills along a line of dislocation which runs\r\nacross the country from sea to sea. On the one side are hills of\r\nancient crystalline rocks whose crumpled structures prove that\r\nthey are but the roots of once lofty mountains; on the other lies\r\na lowland of sandstone and other stratified rocks formed from the\r\nwaste of those long-vanished mountain ranges. Remnants of\r\nsandstone occur in places on the north of the great fault, and are\r\nhere seen to rest on the worn and fairly even surface of the\r\ncrystallines. We may infer that these ancient mountains were\r\nreduced along their margins to low plains, which were slowly\r\nlowered beneath the sea to receive a cover of sedimentary rocks.\r\nStill later came an uplift and dislocation. On the one side\r\nerosion has since stripped off the sandstones for the most part,\r\nbut the hard crystalline rocks yet stand in bold relief. On the\r\nother side the weak sedimentary rocks have been worn down to\r\nlowlands.\r\n\r\nRIFT VALLEYS. In a broken region undergoing uplift or the unequal\r\nsettling which may follow, a slice inclosed between two fissures\r\nmay sink below the level of the crust blocks on either side, thus\r\nforming a linear depression known as a rift valley, or valley of\r\nfracture.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking examples of this rare type of valley is\r\nthe long trough which runs straight from the Lebanon Mountains of\r\nSyria on the north to the Red Sea on the south, and whose central\r\nportion is occupied by the Jordan valley and the Dead Sea. The\r\nplateau which it gashes has been lifted more than three thousand\r\nfeet above sea level, and the bottom of the trough reaches a depth\r\nof two thousand six hundred feet below that level in parts of the\r\nDead Sea. South of the Dead Sea the floor of the trough rises\r\nsomewhat above sea level, and in the Gulf of Akabah again sinks\r\nbelow it. This uneven floor could be accounted for either by the\r\nprofound warping of a valley of erosion or by the unequal\r\ndepression of the floor of a rift valley. But that the trough is a\r\ntrue valley of fracture is proved by the fact that on either side\r\nit is bounded by fault scarps and monoclinal folds. The keystone\r\nof the arch has subsided. Many geologists believe that the Jordan-\r\nAkabah trough, the long narrow basin of the Red Sea, and the chain\r\nof down-faulted valleys which in Africa extends from the strait of\r\nBab-el-Mandeb as far south as Lake Nyassa--valleys which contain\r\nmore than thirty lakes--belong to a single system of dislocation.\r\n\r\nShould you expect the lateral valleys of a rift valley at the time\r\nof its formation to enter it as hanging valleys or at a common\r\nlevel?\r\n\r\nBLOCK MOUNTAINS. Dislocations take place on so grand a scale that\r\nby the upheaval of blocks of the earth's crust or the down-\r\nfaulting of the blocks about one which is relatively stationary,\r\nmountains known as block mountains are produced. A tilted crust\r\nblock may present a steep slope on the side upheaved and a more\r\ngentle descent on the side depressed.\r\n\r\nTHE BASIN RANGES. The plateaus of the United States bounded by the\r\nRocky Mouirtains on the east, and on the west by the ranges which\r\nfront the Pacific, have been profoundly fractured and faulted. The\r\nsystem of great fissures by which they are broken extends north\r\nand south, and the long, narrow, tilted crust blocks intercepted\r\nbetween the fissures give rise to the numerous north-south ranges\r\nof the region. Some of the tilted blocks, as those of southern\r\nOregon, are as yet but moderately carved by erosion, and shallow\r\nlakes lie on the waste that has been washed into the depressions\r\nbetween them. We may therefore conclude that their displacement is\r\nsomewhat recent. Others, as those of Nevada, are so old that they\r\nhave been deeply dissected; their original form has been destroyed\r\nby erosion, and the intermontane depressions are occupied by wide\r\nplains of waste.\r\n\r\nDISLOCATIONS AND RIVER VALLEYS. Before geologists had proved that\r\nrivers can by their own unaided efforts cut deep canyons, it was\r\ncommon to consider any narrow gorge as a gaping fissure of the\r\ncrust. This crude view has long since been set aside. A map of the\r\nplateaus of northern Arizona shows how independent of the immense\r\nfaults of the region is the course of the Colorado River. In the\r\nAlps the tunnels on the Saint Gotthard railway pass six times\r\nbeneath the gorge of the Reuss, but at no point do the rocks show\r\nthe slightest trace of a fault.\r\n\r\nRATE OF DISLOCATION. So far as human experience goes, the earth\r\nmovements which we have just studied, some of which have produced\r\ndeep-sunk valleys and lofty mountain ranges, and faults whose\r\nthrow is to be measured in thousands of feet, are slow and\r\ngradual. They are not accomplished by a single paroxysmal effort,\r\nbut by slow creep and a series of slight slips continued for vast\r\nlengths of time.\r\n\r\nIn the Aspen mining district in Colorado faulting is now going on\r\nat a comparatively rapid rate. Although no sudden slips take\r\nplace, the creep of the rock along certain planes of faulting\r\ngradually bends out of shape the square-set timbers in horizontal\r\ndrifts and has closed some vertical shafts by shifting the upper\r\nportion across the lower. Along one of the faults of this region\r\nit is estimated that there has been a movement of at least four\r\nhundred feet since the Glacial epoch. More conspicuous are the\r\ninstances of active faulting by means of sudden slips. In 1891\r\nthere occurred along an old fault plane in Japan a slip which\r\nproduced an earth rent traced for fifty miles (Fig. 192). The\r\ncountry on one side was depressed in places twenty feet below that\r\non the other, and also shifted as much as thirteen feet\r\nhorizontally in the direction of the fault line.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 a slip occurred for forty miles on the great line of\r\ndislocation which runs along the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada\r\nMountains. In the Owens valley, California, the throw amounted to\r\ntwenty-five feet in places, with a horizontal movement along the\r\nfault line of as much as eighteen feet. Both this slip and that in\r\nJapan just mentioned caused severe earthquakes.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of clearness we have described oscillations,\r\nfoldings, and fractures of the crust as separate processes, each\r\ngiving rise to its own peculiar surface features, but in nature\r\nearth movements are by no means so simple,--they are often\r\nimplicated with one another: folds pass into faults; in a deformed\r\nregion certain rocks have bent, while others under the same\r\nstrain, but under different conditions of plasticity and load,\r\nhave broken; folded mountains have been worn to their roots, and\r\nthe peneplains to which they have been denuded have been upwarped\r\nto mountain height and afterwards dissected,--as in the case of\r\nthe Alleghany ridges, the southern Carpathians, and other ranges,\r\n--or, as in the case of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, have been\r\nbroken and uplifted as mountains of fracture.\r\n\r\nDraw the following diagrams, being careful to show the direction\r\nin which the faulted blocks have moved, by the position of the two\r\nparts of some well-defined layer of limestone, sandstone, or\r\nshale, which occurs on each side of the fault plane, as in Figure\r\n184.\r\n\r\n1. A normal fault with a hade of 15 degrees, the original fault\r\nscarp remaining.\r\n\r\n2. A normal fault with a hade of 50 degrees, the original fault\r\nscarp worn away, showing cliffs caused by harder strata on the\r\ndownthrow side.\r\n\r\n3. A thrust fault with a hade of 30 degrees, showing cliffs due to\r\nharder strata outcropping on the downthrow.\r\n\r\n4. A thrust fault with a hade of 80 degrees, with surface\r\nbaseleveled.\r\n\r\n5. In a region of normal faults a coal mine is being worked along\r\nthe seam of coal AB (Fig. 193). At B it is found broken by a fault\r\nf which hades toward A. To find the seam again, should you advise\r\ntunneling up or down from B?\r\n\r\n6. In a vertical shaft of a coal mine the same bed of coal is\r\npierced twice at different levels because of a fault. Draw a\r\ndiagram to show whether the fault is normal or a thrust.\r\n\r\n7. Copy the diagram in Figure 194, showing how the two ridges may\r\nbe accounted for by a single resistant stratum dislocated by a\r\nfault. Is the fault a STRIKE FAULT, i.e. one running parallel with\r\nthe strike of the strata, or a DIP FAULT, one running parallel\r\nwith the direction of the dip?\r\n\r\n8. Draw a diagram of the block in Figure 195 as it would appear if\r\ndislocated along the plane efg by a normal fault whose throw\r\nequals one fourth the height of the block. Is the fault a strike\r\nor a dip fault? Draw a second diagram showing the same block after\r\ndenudation has worn it down below the center of the upthrown side.\r\nNote that the outcrop of the coal seam is now deceptively\r\nrepeated. This exercise may be done in blocks of wood instead of\r\ndrawings.\r\n\r\n9. Draw diagrams showing by dotted lines the conditions both of A\r\nand of B, Figure 196, after deformation had given the strata their\r\npresent attitude.\r\n\r\n10. What is the attitude of the strata of this earth block, Figure\r\n197? What has taken place along the plane bef? When did the\r\ndislocation occur compared with the folding of the strata? With\r\nthe erosion of the valleys on the right-hand side of the mountain?\r\nWith the deposition of the sediments? Do you find any remnants of\r\nthe original surface baf produced by the dislocation? From the\r\nleft-hand side of the mountain infer what was the relief of the\r\nregion before the dislocation. Give the complete history recorded\r\nin the diagram from the deposition of the strata to the present.\r\n\r\n11. Which is the older fault, in Figure 198, or When did the lava\r\nflow occur? How long a time elapsed between the formation of the\r\ntwo faults as measured in the work done in the interval? How long\r\na time since the formation of the later fault?\r\n\r\n12. Measure by the scale the thickness lie of the coal-bearing\r\nstrata outcropping from a to b in Figure 199. On any convenient\r\nscale draw a similar section of strata with a dip of 30 degrees\r\noutcropping along a horizontal line normal to the strike one\r\nthousand feet in length, and measure the thickness of the strata\r\nby the scale employed. The thickness may also be calculated by\r\ntrigonometry.\r\n\r\nUNCONFORMITY\r\n\r\nStrata deposited one upon, another in an unbroken succession are\r\nsaid to be conformable. But the continuous deposition of strata is\r\noften interrupted by movements of the earth's crust, Old sea\r\nfloors are lifted to form land and are again depressed beneath the\r\nsea to receive a cover of sediments only after an interval during\r\nwhich they were carved by subaerial erosion. An erosion surface\r\nwhich thus parts older from younger strata is known as an\r\nUNCONFORMITY, and the strata above it are said to be UNCONFORMABLE\r\nwith the rocks below, or to rest unconformably upon them. An\r\nunconformity thus records movements of the crust and a consequent\r\nbreak in the deposition of the strata. It denotes a period of land\r\nerosion of greater or less length, which may sometimes be roughly\r\nmeasured by the stage in the erosion cycle which the land surface\r\nhad attained before its burial. Unconformable strata may be\r\nparallel, as in Figure 200, where the record includes the\r\ndeposition of strata, their emergence, the erosion of the land\r\nsurface, a submergence and the deposit of the strata, and lastly,\r\nemergence and the erosion of the present surface.\r\n\r\nOften the earth movements to which the uplift or depression was\r\ndue involved tilting or folding of the earlier strata, so that the\r\nstrata are now nonparallel as well as unconformable. In Figure\r\n201, for example, the record includes deposition, uplift, and\r\ntilting of a; erosion, depression, the deposit of b; and finally\r\nthe uplift which has brought the rocks to open air and permitted\r\nthe dissection by which the unconformity is revealed. From this\r\nsection infer that during early Silurian times the area was sea,\r\nand thick sea muds were laid upon it. These were later altered to\r\nhard slates by pressure and upfolded into mountains. During the\r\nlater Silurian and the Devonian the area was land and suffered\r\nvast denudation. In the Carboniferous period it was lowered\r\nbeneath the sea and received a cover of limestone.\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF MOUNTAINS. It is largely by means of unconformities\r\nthat we read the history of mountain making and other deformations\r\nand movements of the crust. In Figure 203, for example, the\r\ndeformation which upfolded the range of mountains took place after\r\nthe deposit of the series of strata a of which the mountains are\r\ncomposed, and before the deposit of the stratified rocks, which\r\nrest unconformably on a and have not shared their uplift.\r\n\r\nMost great mountain ranges, like the Sierra Nevada and the Alps,\r\nmark lines of weakness along which the earth's crust has yielded\r\nagain and again during the long ages of geological time. The\r\nstrata deposited at various times about their flanks have been\r\ninfolded by later crumplings with the original mountain mass, and\r\nhave been repeatedly crushed, inverted, faulted, intruded with\r\nigneous rocks, and denuded. The structure of great mountain ranges\r\nthus becomes exceedingly complex and difficult to read. A\r\ncomparatively simple case of repeated uplift is shown in Figure\r\n204. In the section of a portion of the Alps shown in Figure 179 a\r\nfar more complicated history may be deciphered.\r\n\r\nUNCONFORMITIES IN THE COLORADO CANYON, ARIZONA. How geological\r\nhistory may be read in unconformities is further illustrated in\r\nFigures 207 and 208. The dark crystalline rocks a at the bottom of\r\nthe canyon are among the most ancient known, and are overlain\r\nunconformably by a mass of tilted coarse marine sandstones b,\r\nwhose total thickness is not seen in the diagram and measures\r\ntwelve thousand feet perpendicularly to the dip. Both a and b rise\r\nto a common level nn and upon them rest the horizontal sea-laid\r\nstrata c, in which the upper portion of the canyon has been cut.\r\n\r\nNote that the crystalline rocks a have been crumpled and crushed.\r\nComparing their structure with that of folded mountains, what do\r\nyou infer as to their relief after their deformation? To which\r\nsurface were they first worn down, mm' or nm? Describe and account\r\nfor the surface mm'. How does it differ from the surface of the\r\ncrystalline rocks seen in the Torridonian Mountains, and why? This\r\nsurface mm' is one of the oldest land surfaces of which any\r\nvestige remains.\r\n\r\nIt is a bit of fossil geography buried from view since the\r\nearliest geological ages and recently brought to light by the\r\nerosion of the canyon.\r\n\r\nHow did the surface mm' come to receive its cover of sandstones b?\r\nFrom the thickness and coarseness of these sediments draw\r\ninferences as to the land mass from which they were derived. Was\r\nit rising or subsiding? high or low? Were its streams slow or\r\nswift? Was the amount of erosion small or great?\r\n\r\nNote the strong dip of these sandstones b. Was the surface mm'\r\ntilted as now when the sandstones were deposited upon it? When was\r\nit tilted? Draw a diagram showing the attitude of the rocks after\r\nthis tilting occurred, and their height relative to sea level.\r\n\r\nThe surface nn' is remarkably even, although diversified by some\r\nlow hills which rise into the bedded rocks of c, and it may be\r\ntraced for long distances up and down the canyon. Were the layers\r\nof b and the surface mm' always thus cut short by nn' as now? What\r\nhas made the surface nn' so even? How does it come to cross the\r\nhard crystalline rocks a and the weaker sandstones b at the same\r\nimpartial level? How did the sediments of c come to be laid upon\r\nit? Give now the entire history recorded in the section, and in\r\naddition that involved in the production of the platform P, shown\r\nin Figure 130, and that of the cutting of the canyon. How does the\r\ntime involved in the cutting of the canyon compare with that\r\nrequired for the production of the surfaces mm', nn', and P?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nAny sudden movement of the rocks of the crust, as when they tear\r\napart when a fissure is formed or extended, or slip from time to\r\ntime along a growing fault, produces a jar called an earthquake,\r\nwhich spreads in all directions from the place of disturbance.\r\n\r\nTHE CHARLESTON EARTHQUAKE. On the evening of August 31, 1886, the\r\ncity of Charleston, S.C., was shaken by one of the greatest\r\nearthquakes which has occurred in the United States. A slight\r\ntremor which rattled the windows was followed a few seconds later\r\nby a roar, as of subterranean thunder, as the main shock passed\r\nbeneath the city. Houses swayed to and fro, and their heaving\r\nfloors overturned furniture and threw persons off their feet as,\r\ndizzy and nauseated, they rushed to the doors for safety. In sixty\r\nseconds a number of houses were completely wrecked, fourteen\r\nthousand chimneys were toppled over, and in all the city scarcely\r\na building was left without serious injury. In the vicinity of\r\nCharleston railways were twisted and trains derailed. Fissures\r\nopened in the loose superficial deposits, and in places spouted\r\nwater mingled with sand from shallow underlying aquifers.\r\n\r\nThe point of origin, or FOCUS, of the earthquake was inferred from\r\nsubsequent investigations to be a rent in the rocks about twelve\r\nmiles beneath the surface. From the center of greatest\r\ndisturbance, which lay above the focus, a few miles northwest of\r\nthe city, the surface shock traveled outward in every direction,\r\nwith decreasing effects, at the rate of nearly two hundred miles\r\nper minute. It was felt from Boston to Cuba, and from eastern Iowa\r\nto the Bermudas, over a circular area whose diameter was a\r\nthousand miles.\r\n\r\nAn earthquake is transmitted from the focus through the elastic\r\nrocks of the crust, as a wave, or series of waves, of compression\r\nand rarefaction, much as a sound wave is transmitted through the\r\nelastic medium of the air. Each earth particle vibrates with\r\nexceeding swiftness, but over a very short path. The swing of a\r\nparticle in firm rock seldom exceeds one tenth of an inch in\r\nordinary earthquakes, and when it reaches one half an inch and an\r\ninch, the movement becomes dangerous and destructive.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of earthquake waves, like that of all elastic waves,\r\nvaries with the temperature and elasticity of the medium. In the\r\ndeep, hot, elastic rocks they speed faster than in the cold and\r\nbroken rocks near the surface. The deeper the point of origin and\r\nthe more violent the initial shock, the faster and farther do the\r\nvibrations run.\r\n\r\nGreat earthquakes, caused by some sudden displacement or some\r\nviolent rending of the rocks, shake the entire planet. Their waves\r\nrun through the body of the earth at the rate of about three\r\nhundred and fifty miles a minute, and more slowly round its\r\ncircumference, registering their arrival at opposite sides of the\r\nglobe on the exceedingly delicate instruments of modern earthquake\r\nobservatories.\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL EFFECTS. Even great earthquakes seldom produce\r\ngeological effects of much importance. Landslides may be shaken\r\ndown from the sides of mountains and hills, and cracks may be\r\nopened in the surface deposits of plains; but the transient\r\nshiver, which may overturn cities and destroy thousands of human\r\nlives, runs through the crust and leaves it much the same as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES ATTENDING GREAT DISPLACEMENTS. Great earthquakes\r\nfrequently attend the displacement of large masses of the rocks of\r\nthe crust. In 1822 the coast of Chile was suddenly raised three or\r\nfour feet, and the rise was five or six feet a mile inland. In\r\n1835 the same region was again upheaved from two to ten feet. In\r\neach instance a destructive earthquake was felt for one thousand\r\nmiles along the coast.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE OF 1906. A sudden dislocation\r\noccurred in 1906 along an ancient fault plane which extends for\r\n300 miles through western California. The vertical displacement\r\ndid not exceed four feet, while the horizontal shifting reached a\r\nmaximum of twenty feet. Fences, rows of trees, and roads which\r\ncrossed the fault were broken and offset. The latitude and\r\nlongitude of all points over thousands of square miles were\r\nchanged. On each side of the fault the earth blocks moved in\r\nopposite directions, the block on the east moving southward and\r\nthat on the west moving northward and to twice the distance. East\r\nand west of the fault the movements lessened with increasing\r\ndistance from it.\r\n\r\nThis sudden slip set up an earthquake lasting sixty-five seconds,\r\nfollowed by minor shocks recurring for many days. In places the\r\njar shook down the waste on steep hillsides, snapped off or\r\nuprooted trees, and rocked houses from their foundations or threw\r\ndown their walls or chimneys. The water mains of San Francisco\r\nwere broken, and the city was thus left defenseless against a\r\nconflagration which destroyed $500,000,000 worth of property. The\r\ndestructive effects varied with the nature of the ground.\r\nBuildings on firm rock suffered least, while those on deep\r\nalluvium were severely shaken by the undulations, like water\r\nwaves, into which the loose material was thrown. Well-braced steel\r\nstructures, even of the largest size, were earthquake proof, and\r\nbuildings of other materials, when honestly built and\r\nintelligently designed to withstand earthquake shocks, usually\r\nsuffered little injury. The length of the intervals between severe\r\nearthquakes in western California shows that a great dislocation\r\nso relieves the stresses of the adjacent earth blocks that scores\r\nof years may elapse before the stresses again accumulate and cause\r\nanother dislocation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most violent earthquake which ever visited the United\r\nStates attended the depression, in 1812, of a region seventy-five\r\nmiles long and thirty miles wide, near New Madrid, Mo. Much of the\r\narea was converted into swamps and some into shallow lakes, while\r\na region twenty miles in diameter was bulged up athwart the\r\nchannel of the Mississippi. Slight quakes are still felt in this\r\nregion from time to time, showing that the strains to which the\r\ndislocation was due have not yet been fully relieved.\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES ORIGINATING BENEATH THE SEA. Many earthquakes\r\noriginate beneath the sea, and in a number of examples they seem\r\nto have been accompanied, as soundings indicate, by local\r\nsubsidences of the ocean bottom. There have been instances where\r\nthe displacement has been sufficient to set the entire Pacific\r\nOcean pulsating for many hours. In mid ocean the wave thus\r\nproduced has a height of only a few feet, while it may be two\r\nhundred miles in width. On shores near the point of origin\r\ndestructive waves two or three score feet in height roll in, and\r\non coasts thousands of miles distant the expiring undulations may\r\nbe still able to record themselves on tidal gauges.\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF EARTHQUAKES. Every half hour some considerable\r\narea of the earth's surface is sensibly shaken by an earthquake,\r\nbut earthquakes are by no means uniformly distributed over the\r\nglobe. As we might infer from what we know as to their causes,\r\nearthquakes are most frequent in regions now undergoing\r\ndeformation. Such are young rising mountain ranges, fault lines\r\nwhere readjustments recur from time to time, and the slopes of\r\nsuboceanic depressions whose steepness suggests that subsidence\r\nmay there be in progress.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes, often of extreme severity, frequently visit the lofty\r\nand young ranges of the Andes, while they are little known in the\r\nsubdued old mountains of Brazil. The Highlands of Scotland are\r\ncrossed by a deep and singularly straight depression called the\r\nGreat Glen, which has been excavated along a very ancient line of\r\ndislocation. The earthquakes which occur from time to time in this\r\nregion, such as the Inverness earthquake in 1891, are referred to\r\nslight slips along this fault plane.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, earthquakes are very frequent. More than a thousand are\r\nrecorded every year, and twenty-nine world-shaking earthquakes\r\noccurred in the three years ending with 1901. They originate, for\r\nthe most part, well down on the eastern flank of the earth fold\r\nwhose summit is the mountainous crest of the islands, and which\r\nplunges steeply beneath the sea to the abyss of the Tuscarora\r\nDeep.\r\n\r\nMINOR CAUSES OF EARTHQUAKES. Since any concussion within the crust\r\nsets up an earth jar, there are several minor causes of\r\nearthquakes, such as volcanic explosions and even the collapse of\r\nthe roofs of caves. The earthquakes which attend the eruption of\r\nvolcanoes are local, even in the case of the most violent volcanic\r\nparoxysms known. When the top of a volcano has been blown to\r\nfragments, the accompanying earth shock has sometimes not been\r\nfelt more than twenty-five miles away.\r\n\r\nDEPTH OF FOCUS. The focus of the Charleston earthquake, estimated\r\nat about twelve miles below the surface, was exceptionally deep.\r\nVolcanic earthquakes are particularly shallow, and probably no\r\nearthquakes known have started at a greater depth than fifteen or\r\ntwenty miles. This distance is so slight compared with the earth's\r\nradius that we may say that earthquakes are but skin-deep.\r\n\r\nShould you expect the velocity of an earthquake to be greater in a\r\npeneplain or in a river delta?\r\n\r\nAfter an earthquake, piles on which buildings rested were found\r\ndriven into the ground, and chimneys crushed at base. From what\r\ndirection did the shock come?\r\n\r\nChimneys standing on the south walls of houses toppled over on the\r\nroof. Should you infer that the shock in this case came from the\r\nnorth or south?\r\n\r\nHow should you expect a shock from the east to affect pictures\r\nhanging on the east and the west walls of a room? how the pictures\r\nhanging on the north and the south walls?\r\n\r\nIn parts of the country, as in southwestern Wisconsin, slender\r\nerosion pillars, or \"monuments,\" are common. What inference could\r\nyou draw as to the occurrence in such regions of severe\r\nearthquakes in the recent past?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nVOLCANOES\r\n\r\n\r\nConnected with movements of the earth's crust which take place so\r\nslowly that they can be inferred only from their effects is one of\r\nthe most rapid and impressive of all geological processes,--the\r\nextrusion of molten rock from beneath the surface of the earth,\r\ngiving rise to all the various phenomena of volcanoes.\r\n\r\nIn a volcano, molten rock from a region deep below, which we may\r\ncall its reservoir, ascends through a pipe or fissure to the\r\nsurface. The materials erupted may be spread over vast areas, or,\r\nas is commonly the case, may accumulate about the opening, forming\r\na conical pile known as the volcanic cone. It is to this cone that\r\npopular usage refers the word VOLCANO; but the cone is simply a\r\nconspicuous part of the volcanic mechanism whose still more\r\nimportant parts, the reservoir and the pipe, are hidden from view.\r\n\r\nVolcanic eruptions are of two types,--EFFUSIVE eruptions, in which\r\nmolten rock wells up from below and flows forth in streams of LAVA\r\n(a comprehensive term applied to all kinds of rock emitted from\r\nvolcanoes in a molten state), and EXPLOSIVE eruptions, in which\r\nthe rock is blown out in fragments great and small by the\r\nexpansive force of steam.\r\n\r\nERUPTIONS OF THE EFFUSIVE TYPE\r\n\r\nTHE HAWAIIAN VOLCANOES. The Hawaiian Islands are all volcanic in\r\norigin, and have a linear arrangement characteristic of many\r\nvolcanic groups in all parts of the world. They are strung along a\r\nnorthwest-southeast line, their volcanoes standing in two parallel\r\nrows as if reared along two adjacent lines of fracture or folding.\r\nIn the northwestern islands the volcanoes have long been extinct\r\nand are worn low by erosion. In the southeastern island. Hawaii,\r\nthree volcanoes are still active and in process of building. Of\r\nthese Mauna Loa, the monarch of volcanoes, with a girth of two\r\nhundred miles and a height of nearly fourteen thousand feet above\r\nsea level, is a lava dome the slope of whose sides does not\r\naverage more than five degrees. On the summit is an elliptical\r\nbasin ten miles in circumference and several hundred feet deep.\r\nConcentric cracks surround the rim, and from time to time the\r\nbasin is enlarged as great slices are detached from the vertical\r\nwalls and engulfed.\r\n\r\nSuch a volcanic basin, formed by the insinking of the top of the\r\ncone, is called a CALDERA.\r\n\r\nOn the flanks of Mauna Loa, four thousand feet above sea level,\r\nlies the caldera of Kilauea, an independent volcano whose dome has\r\nbeen joined to the larger mountain by the gradual growth of the\r\ntwo. In each caldera the floor, which to the eye is a plain of\r\nblack lava, is the congealed surface of a column of molten rock.\r\nAt times of an eruption lakes of boiling lava appear which may be\r\ncompared to air holes in a frozen river. Great waves surge up,\r\nlifting tons of the fiery liquid a score of feet in air, to fall\r\nback with a mighty plunge and roar, and occasionally the lava\r\nrises several hundred feet in fountains of dazzling brightness.\r\nThe lava lakes may flood the floor of the basin, but in historic\r\ntimes have never been known to fill it and overflow the rim.\r\nInstead, the heavy column of lava breaks way through the sides of\r\nthe mountain and discharges in streams which flow down the\r\nmountain slopes for a distance sometimes of as much as thirty-five\r\nmiles. With the drawing off of the lava the column in the duct of\r\nthe volcano lowers, and the floor of the caldera wholly or in part\r\nsubsides. A black and steaming abyss marks the place of the lava\r\nlakes. After a time the lava rises in the duct, the floor is\r\nfloated higher, and the boiling lakes reappear.\r\n\r\nThe eruptions of the Hawaiian volcanoes are thus of the effusive\r\ntype. The column of lava rises, breaks through the side of the\r\nmountain, and discharges in lava streams. There are no explosions,\r\nand usually no earthquakes, or very slight ones, accompany the\r\neruptions. The lava in the calderas boils because of escaping\r\nsteam, but the vapor emitted is comparatively little, and seldom\r\nhangs above the summits in heavy clouds. We see here in its\r\nsimplest form the most impressive and important fact in all\r\nvolcanic action, molten rock has been driven upward to the surface\r\nfrom some deep-lying source.\r\n\r\nLAVA FLOWS. As lava issues from the side of a volcano or overflows\r\nfrom the summit, it flows away in a glowing stream resembling\r\nmolten iron drawn white-hot from an iron furnace. The surface of\r\nthe stream soon cools and blackens, and the hard crust of\r\nnonconducting rock may grow thick and firm enough to form a\r\ntunnel, within which the fluid lava may flow far before it loses\r\nits heat to any marked degree. Such tunnels may at last be left as\r\ncaves by the draining away of the lava, and are sometimes several\r\nmiles in length.\r\n\r\nPAHOEHOE AND AA. When the crust of highly fluid lava remains\r\nunbroken after its first freezing, it presents a smooth, hummocky,\r\nand ropy surface known by the Hawaiian term PAHOEHOE. On the other\r\nhand, the crust of a viscid flow may be broken and splintered as\r\nit is dragged along by the slowly moving mass beneath. The stream\r\nthen appears as a field of stones clanking and grinding on, with\r\nhere and there from some chink a dull red glow or a wisp of steam.\r\nIt sets to a surface called AA, of broken, sharp-edged blocks,\r\nwhich is often both difficult and dangerous to traverse.\r\n\r\nFISSURE ERUPTIONS. Some of the largest and most important outflows\r\nof lava have not been connected with volcanic cones, but have been\r\ndischarged from fissures, flooding the country far and wide with\r\nmolten rock. Sheet after sheet of molten rock has been\r\nsuccessively outpoured, and there have been built up, layer upon\r\nlayer, plateaus of lava thousands of feet in thickness and many\r\nthousands of square miles in area.\r\n\r\nICELAND. This island plateau has been rent from time to time by\r\nfissures from which floods of lava have outpoured. In some\r\ninstances the lava discharges along the whole length of the\r\nfissure, but more often only at certain points upon it. The Laki\r\nfissure, twenty miles long, was in eruption in 1783 for seven\r\nmonths. The inundation of fluid rock which poured from it is the\r\nlargest of historic record, reaching a distance of forty-seven\r\nmiles and covering two hundred and twenty square miles to an\r\naverage depth of a hundred feet. At the present time the fissure\r\nis traced by a line of several hundred insignificant mounds of\r\nfragmental materials which mark where the lava issued.\r\n\r\nThe distance to which the fissure eruptions of Iceland flow on\r\nslopes extremely gentle is noteworthy. One such stream is ninety\r\nmiles in length, and another seventy miles long has a slope of\r\nlittle more than one half a degree.\r\n\r\nWhere lava is emitted at one point and flows to a less distance\r\nthere is gradually built up a dome of the shape of an inverted\r\nsaucer with an immense base but comparatively low. Many LAVA DOMES\r\nhave been discovered in Iceland, although from their exceedingly\r\ngentle slopes, often but two or three degrees, they long escaped\r\nthe notice of explorers.\r\n\r\nThe entire plateau of Iceland, a region as large as Ohio, is\r\ncomposed of volcanic products,--for the most part of successive\r\nsheets of lava whose total thickness falls little short of two\r\nmiles. The lava sheets exposed to view were outpoured in open air\r\nand not beneath the sea; for peat bogs and old forest grounds are\r\ninterbedded with them, and the fossil plants of these vegetable\r\ndeposits prove that the plateau has long been building and is very\r\nancient. On the steep sea cliffs of the island, where its\r\nstructure is exhibited, the sheets of lava are seen to be cut with\r\nmany DIKES,--fissures which have been filled by molten rock,--and\r\nthere is little doubt that it was through these fissures that the\r\nlava outwelled in successive flows which spread far and wide over\r\nthe country and gradually reared the enormous pile of the plateau.\r\n\r\nERUPTIONS OF THE EXPLOSIVE TYPE\r\n\r\nIn the majority of volcanoes the lava which rises in the pipe is\r\nat least in part blown into fragments with violent explosions and\r\nshot into the air together with vast quantities of water vapor and\r\nvarious gases. The finer particles into--which the lava is\r\nexploded are called VOLCANIC DUST or VOLCANIC ASHES, and are often\r\ncarried long distances by the wind before they settle to the\r\nearth. The coarser fragments fall about the vent and there\r\naccumulate in a steep, conical, volcanic mountain. As successive\r\nexplosions keep open the throat of the pipe, there remains on the\r\nsummit a cup-shaped depression called the CRATER.\r\n\r\nSTROMBOLI. To study the nature of these explosions we may visit\r\nStromboli, a low volcano built chiefly of fragmental materials,\r\nwhich rises from the sea off the north coast of Sicily and is in\r\nconstant though moderate action.\r\n\r\nOver the summit hangs a cloud of vapor which strikingly resembles\r\nthe column of smoke puffed from the smokestack of a locomotive, in\r\nthat it consists of globular masses, each the product of a\r\ndistinct explosion. At night the cloud of vapor is lighted with a\r\nred glow at intervals of a few minutes, like the glow on the trail\r\nof smoke behind the locomotive when from time to time the fire bos\r\nis opened. Because of this intermittent light flashing thousands\r\nof feet above the sea, Stromboli has been given the name of the\r\nLighthouse of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nLooking down into the crater of the volcano, one sees a viscid\r\nlava slowly seething. The agitation gradually increases. A great\r\nbubble forms. It bursts with an explosion which causes the walls\r\nof the crater to quiver with a miniature earthquake, and an\r\noutrush of steam carries the fragments of the bubble aloft for a\r\nthousand feet to fall into the crater or on the mountain side\r\nabout it. With the explosion the cooled and darkened crust of the\r\nlava is removed, and the light of the incandescent liquid beneath\r\nis reflected from the cloud of vapor which overhangs the cone.\r\n\r\nAt Stromboli we learn the lesson that the explosive force in\r\nvolcanoes is that of steam. The lava in the pipe is permeated with\r\nit much as is a thick boiling porridge. The steam in boiling\r\nporridge is unable to escape freely and gathers into bubbles which\r\nin breaking spurt out drops of the pasty substance; in the same\r\nway the explosion of great bubbles of steam in the viscid lava\r\nshoots clots and fragments of it into the air.\r\n\r\nKRAKATOA. The most violent eruption of history, that of Krakatoa,\r\na small volcanic island in the strait between Sumatra and Java,\r\noccurred in the last week of August, 1883. Continuous explosions\r\nshot a column of steam and ashes. seventeen miles in air. A black\r\ncloud, beneath which was midnight darkness and from which fell a\r\nrain of ashes and stones, overspread the surrounding region to a\r\ndistance of one hundred and fifty miles. Launched on the currents\r\nof the upper air, the dust was swiftly carried westward to long\r\ndistances. Three days after the eruption it fell on the deck of a\r\nship sixteen hundred miles away, and in thirteen days the finest\r\nimpalpable powder from the volcano had floated round the globe.\r\nFor many months the dust hung over Europe and America as a faint\r\nlofty haze illuminated at sunrise and sunset with brilliant\r\ncrimson. In countries nearer the eruption, as in India and Africa,\r\nthe haze for some time was so thick that it colored sun and moon\r\nwith blue, green, and copper-red tints and encircled them with\r\ncoronas.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of even a thousand miles the detonations of the\r\neruption sounded like the booming of heavy guns a few miles away.\r\nIn one direction they were audible for a distance as great as that\r\nfrom San Francisco to Cleveland. The entire atmosphere was thrown\r\ninto undulations under which all barometers rose and fell as the\r\nair waves thrice encircled the earth. The shock of the explosions\r\nraised sea waves which swept round the adjacent shores at a height\r\nof more than fifty feet, and which were perceptible halfway around\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the eruption it was found that half the mountain\r\nhad been blown away, and that where the central part of the island\r\nhad been the sea was a thousand feet deep.\r\n\r\nMARTINIQUE AND ST. VINCENT. In 1902 two dormant volcanoes of the\r\nWest Indies, Mt. Pelee in Martinique and Soufriere in St. Vincent,\r\nbroke into eruption simultaneously. No lava was emitted, but there\r\nwere blown into the air great quantities of ashes, which mantled\r\nthe adjacent parts of the islands with a pall as of gray snow. In\r\nearly stages of the eruption lakes which occupied old craters were\r\ndischarged and swept down the ash-covered mountain valleys in\r\ntorrents of boiling mud.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions there was shot from the crater of each\r\nvolcano a thick and heavy cloud of incandescent ashes and steam,\r\nwhich rushed down the mountain side like an avalanche, red with\r\nglowing stones and scintillating with lightning flashes. Forests\r\nand buildings in its path were leveled as by a tornado, wood was\r\ncharred and set on fire by the incandescent fragments, all\r\nvegetation was destroyed, and to breathe the steam and hot,\r\nsuffocating dust of the cloud was death to every living creature.\r\nOn the morning of the 8th of May, 1902, the first of these\r\npeculiar avalanches from Mt. Pelee fell on the city of St. Pierre\r\nand instantly destroyed the lives of its thirty thousand\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe eruptions of many volcanoes partake of both the effusive and\r\nthe explosive types: the molten rock in the pipe is in part blown\r\ninto the air with explosions of steam, and in part is discharged\r\nin streams of lava over the lip of the crater and from fissures in\r\nthe sides of the cone. Such are the eruptions of Vesuvius, one of\r\nwhich is illustrated in Figure 219.\r\n\r\nSUBMARINE ERUPTIONS. The many volcanic islands of the ocean and\r\nthe coral islands resting on submerged volcanic peaks prove that\r\neruptions have often taken place upon the ocean floor and have\r\nthere built up enormous piles of volcanic fragments and lava. The\r\nHawaiian volcanoes rise from a depth of eighteen thousand feet of\r\nwater and lift their heads to about thirty thousand feet above the\r\nocean bed. Christmas Island (see p. 194), built wholly beneath the\r\nocean, is a coral-capped volcanic peak, whose total height, as\r\nmeasured from the bottom of the sea, is more than fifteen thousand\r\nfeet. Deep-sea soundings have revealed the presence of numerous\r\npeaks which fail to reach sea level and which no doubt are\r\nsubmarine volcanoes. A number of volcanoes on the land were\r\nsubmarine in their early stages, as, for example, the vast pile of\r\nEtna, the celebrated Sicilian volcano, which rests on stratified\r\nvolcanic fragments containing marine shells now uplifted from the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nSubmarine outflows of lava and deposits of volcanic fragments\r\nbecome covered with sediments during the long intervals between\r\neruptions. Such volcanic deposits are said to be CONTEMPORANEOUS,\r\nbecause they are formed during the same period as the strata among\r\nwhich they are imbedded. Contemporaneous lava sheets may be\r\nexpected to bake the surface of the stratum on which they rest,\r\nwhile the sediments deposited upon them are unaltered by their\r\nheat. They are among the most permanent records of volcanic\r\naction, far outlasting the greatest volcanic mountains built in\r\nopen air.\r\n\r\nFrom upraised submarine volcanoes, such as Christmas Island, it is\r\nlearned that lava flows which are poured out upon the bottom of\r\nthe sea do not differ materially either in composition or texture\r\nfrom those of the land.\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC PRODUCTS\r\n\r\nVast amounts of steam are, as we have seen, emitted from\r\nvolcanoes, and comparatively small quantities of other vapors,\r\nsuch as various acid and sulphurous gases. The rocks erupted from\r\nvolcanoes differ widely in chemical composition and in texture.\r\n\r\nACIDIC AND BASIC LAVAS. Two classes of volcanic rocks may be\r\ndistinguished,--those containing a large proportion of silica\r\n(silicic acid, SiO2) and therefore called ACIDIC, and those\r\ncontaining less silica and a larger proportion of the bases (lime,\r\nmagnesia, soda, etc.) and therefore called BASIC. The acidic\r\nlavas, of which RHYOLITE and THRACHYTE are examples, are\r\ncomparatively light in color and weight, and are difficult to\r\nmelt. The basic lavas, of which BASALT is a type, are dark and\r\nheavy and melt at a lower temperature.\r\n\r\nSCORIA AND PUMICE. The texture of volcanic rocks depends in part\r\non the degree to which they were distended by the steam which\r\npermeated them when in a molten state. They harden into compact\r\nrock where the steam cannot expand. Where the steam is released\r\nfrom pressure, as on the surface of a lava stream, it forms\r\nbubbles (steam blebs) of various sizes, which give the hardened\r\nrock a cellular structure (Fig. 220), In this way are formed the\r\nrough slags and clinkers called SCORIA, which are found on the\r\nsurface of flows and which are also thrown out as clots of lava in\r\nexplosive eruptions.\r\n\r\nOn the surface of the seething lava in the throat of the volcano\r\nthere gathers a rock foam, which, when hurled into the air, is\r\ncooled and falls as PUMICE,--a spongy gray rock so light that it\r\nfloats on water.\r\n\r\nAMYGDULES. The steam blebs of lava flows are often drawn out from\r\na spherical to an elliptical form resembling that of an almond,\r\nand after the rock has cooled these cavities are gradually filled\r\nwith minerals deposited from solution by underground water. From\r\ntheir shape such casts are called amygdules (Greek, amygdalon, an\r\nalmond). Amygdules are commonly composed of silica. Lavas contain\r\nboth silica and the alkalies, potash and soda, and after\r\ndissolving the alkalies, percolating water is able to take silica\r\nalso into solution. Most AGATES are banded amygdules in which the\r\nsilica has been laid in varicolored, concentric layers.\r\n\r\nGLASSY AND STONY LAVAS. Volcanic rocks differ in texture according\r\nalso to the rate at which they have solidified. When rapidly\r\ncooled, as on the surface of a lava flow, molten rock chills to a\r\nglass, because the minerals of which it is composed have not had\r\ntime to separate themselves from the fused mixture and form\r\ncrystals. Under slow cooling, as in the interior of the flow, it\r\nbecomes a stony mass composed of crystals set in a glassy paste.\r\nIn thin slices of volcanic glass one may see under the microscope\r\nthe beginnings of crystal growth in filaments and needles and\r\nfeathery forms, which are the rudiments of the crystals of various\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\nSpherulites, which also mark the first changes of glassy lavas\r\ntoward a stony condition, are little balls within the rock,\r\nvarying from microscopic size to several inches in diameter, and\r\nmade up of radiating fibers.\r\n\r\nPerlitic structure, common among glassy lavas, consists of\r\nmicroscopic curving and interlacing cracks, due to contraction.\r\n\r\nFLOW LINES are exhibited by volcanic rocks both to the naked eye\r\nand under the microscope. Steam blebs, together with crystals and\r\ntheir embryonic forms, are left arranged in lines and streaks by\r\nthe currents of the flowing lava as it stiffened into rock.\r\n\r\nPORPHYRITIC STRUCTURE. Rocks whose ground mass has scattered\r\nthrough it large conspicuous crystals are said to be PORPHYRITIC,\r\nand it is especially among volcanic rocks that this structure\r\noccurs. The ground mass of porphyries either may be glassy or may\r\nconsist in part of a felt of minute crystals; in either case it\r\nrepresents the consolidation of the rock after its outpouring upon\r\nthe surface. On the other hand, the large crystals of porphyry\r\nhave slowly formed deep below the ground at an earlier date.\r\n\r\nCOLUMNAR STRUCTURE. Just as wet starch contracts on drying to\r\nprismatic forms, so lava often contracts on cooling to a mass of\r\nclose-set, prismatic, and commonly six-sided columns, which stand\r\nat right angles to the cooling surface. The upper portion of a\r\nflow, on rapid cooling from the surface exposed to the air, may\r\ncontract to a confused mass of small and irregular prisms; while\r\nthe remainder forms large and beautifully regular columns, which\r\nhave grown upward by slow cooling from beneath.\r\n\r\nFRAGMENTAL MATERIALS\r\n\r\nRocks weighing many tons are often thrown from a volcano at the\r\nbeginning of an outburst by the breaking up of the solidofied\r\nfloor of the crater; and during the progress of an eruption large\r\nblocks may be torn from the throat of the volcano by the outrush\r\nof steam. But the most important fragmental materials are those\r\nderived from the lava itself. As lava rises in the pipe, the steam\r\nwhich permeates it is released from pressure and explodes, hurling\r\nthe lava into the air in fragments of all sizes,--large pieces of\r\nscoria, LAPILLI (fragments the size of a pea or walnut), volcanic\r\n\"sand\" and volcanic \"ashes.\" The latter resemble in appearance the\r\nashes of wood or coal, but they are not in any sense, like them, a\r\nresidue after combustion.\r\n\r\nVolcanic ashes are produced in several ways: lava rising in the\r\nvolcanic duct is exploded into fine dust by the steam which\r\npermeates it; glassy lava, hurled into the air and cooled\r\nsuddenly, is brought into a state of high strain and tension, and,\r\nlike Prince Rupert's drops, flies to pieces at the least\r\nprovocation. The clash of rising and falling projectiles also\r\nproduces some dust, a fair sample of which may be made by grating\r\ntogether two pieces of pumice.\r\n\r\nBeds of volcanic ash occur widely among recent deposits in the\r\nwestern United States. In Nebraska ash beds are found in twenty\r\ncounties, and are often as white as powdered pumice. The beds grow\r\nthicker and coarser toward the southwestern part of the state,\r\nwhere their thickness sometimes reaches fifty feet. In what\r\ndirection would you look for the now extinct volcano whose\r\nexplosive eruptions are thus recorded?\r\n\r\nTUFF. This is a convenient term designating any rock composed of\r\nvolcanic fragments. Coarse tuffs of angular fragments are called\r\nVOLCANIC BRECIA, and when the fragments have been rounded and\r\nsorted by water the rock is termed a VOLCANIC CONGLOMERATE. Even\r\nwhen deposited in the open air, as on the slopes of a volcano,\r\ntuffs may be rudely bedded and their fragments more or less\r\nrounded, and unless marine shells or the remains of land plants\r\nand animals are found as fossils in them, there is often\r\nconsiderable difficulty in telling whether they were laid in water\r\nor in air. In either case they soon become consolidated. Chemical\r\ndeposits from percolating waters fill the interstices, and the bed\r\nof loose fragments is cemented to hard rock.\r\n\r\nThe materials of which tuffs are composed are easily recognized as\r\nvolcanic in their origin. The fragments are more or less cellular,\r\naccording to the degree to which they were distended with steam\r\nwhen in a molten state, and even in the finest dust one may see\r\nthe glass or the crystals of lava from which it was derived. Tuffs\r\noften contain VOCLANIC BOMBS,--balls of lava which took shape\r\nwhile whirling in the air, and solidified before falling to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nANCIENT VOLCANIC ROCKS. It is in these materials and structures\r\nwhich we have described that volcanoes leave some of their most\r\nenduring records. Even the volcanic rocks of the earliest geological\r\nages, uplifted after long burial beneath the sea and exposed to view\r\nby deep erosion, are recognized and their history read despite the\r\nmany changes which they may have undergone. A sheet of ancient lava\r\nmay be distinguished by its composition from the sediments among\r\nwhich it is imbedded. The direction of its flow lines may be noted.\r\nThe cellular and slaggy surface where the pasty lava was distended\r\nby escaping steam is recognized by the amygdules which now fill the\r\nancient steam blebs. In a pile of successive sheets of lava each\r\nflow may be distinguished and its thickness measured; for the\r\nsurface of each sheet is glassy and scoriaceous, while beneath its\r\nupper portions the lava of each flow is more dense and stony. The\r\nlength of time which elapsed before a sheet was buried beneath the\r\nmaterials of succeeding eruptions may be told by the amount of\r\nweathering which it had undergone, the depth of ancient soil--now\r\nbaked to solid rock--upon it, and the erosion which it had suffered\r\nin the interval.\r\n\r\nIf the flow occurred from some submarine volcano, we may recognize\r\nthe fact by the sea-laid sediments which cover it, filling the\r\ncracks and crevices of its upper surface and containing pieces of\r\nlava washed from it in their basal layers.\r\n\r\nLong-buried glassy lavas devitrify, or pass to a stony condition,\r\nunder the unceasing action of underground waters; but their flow\r\nlines and perlitic and spherulitic structures remain to tell of\r\ntheir original state.\r\n\r\nAncient tuffs are known by the fragmental character of their\r\nvolcanic material, even though they have been altered to firm\r\nrock. Some remains of land animals and plants may be found\r\nimbedded to tell that the beds were laid in open air; while the\r\nremains of marine organisms would prove as surely that the tuffs\r\nwere deposited in the sea.\r\n\r\nIn these ways ancient volcanoes have been recognized near Boston,\r\nin southeastern Pennsylvania, about Lake Superior, and in other\r\nregions of the United States.\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE HISTORY OF A VOLCANO\r\n\r\nThe invasion of a region by volcanic forces is attended by\r\nmovements of the crust heralded by earthquakes. A fissure or a\r\npipe is opened and the building of the cone or the spreading of\r\nwide lava sheets is begun.\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC CONES. The shape of a volcanic cone depends chiefly on\r\nthe materials erupted. Cones made of fragments may have sides as\r\nsteep as the angle of repose, which in the case of coarse scoria\r\nis sometimes as high as thirty or forty degrees. About the base of\r\nthe mountain the finer materials erupted are spread in more gentle\r\nslopes, and are also washed forward by rains and streams. The\r\nnormal profile is thus a symmetric cone with a flaring base.\r\n\r\nCones built of lava vary in form according to the liquidity of the\r\nlava. Domes of gentle slope, as those of Hawaii, for example, are\r\nformed of basalt, which flows to long distances before it\r\ncongeals. When superheated and emitted from many vents, this\r\neasily melted lava builds great plateaus, such as that of Iceland.\r\nOn the other hand, lavas less fusible, or poured out at a lower\r\ntemperature, stiffen when they have flowed but a short distance,\r\nand accumulate in a steep cone. Trachyte has been extruded in a\r\nstate so viscid that it has formed steepsided domes like that of\r\nSarcoui.\r\n\r\nMost volcanoes are built, like Vesuvius, both of lava flows and of\r\ntuffs, and sections show that the structure of the cone consists\r\nof outward-dipping, alternating layers of lava, scoria, and ashes.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the cone is rent by the violence of explosions\r\nand by the weight of the column of lava in the pipe. The fissures\r\nare filled with lava and some discharge on the sides of the\r\nmountain, building parasitic cones, while all form dikes, which\r\nstrengthen the pile with ribs of hard rock and make it more\r\ndifficult to rend.\r\n\r\nGreat catastrophes are recorded in the shape of some volcanoes\r\nwhich consist of a circular rim perhaps miles in diameter,\r\ninclosing a vast crater or a caldera within which small cones may\r\nrise. We may infer that at some time the top of the mountain has\r\nbeen blown off, or has collapsed and been engulfed because some\r\nreservoir beneath had been emptied by long-continued eruptions.\r\n\r\nThe cone-building stage may be said to continue until eruptions of\r\nlava and fragmental materials cease altogether. Sooner or later\r\nthe volcanic forces shift or die away, and no further eruptions\r\nadd to the pile or replace its losses by erosion during periods of\r\nrepose. Gases however are still emitted, and, as sulphur vapors\r\nare conspicuous among them, such vents are called SOLFATARAS.\r\nMount Hood, in Oregon, is an example of a volcano sunk to this\r\nstage. From a steaming rift on its side there rise sulphurous\r\nfumes which, half a mile down the wind, will tarnish a silver\r\ncoin.\r\n\r\nGEYSERS AND HOT SPRINGS. The hot springs of volcanic regions are\r\namong the last vestiges of volcanic heat. Periodically eruptive\r\nboiling springs are termed geysers. In each of the geyser regions\r\nof the earth--the Yellowstone National Park, Iceland, and New\r\nZealand--the ground water of the locality is supposed to be heated\r\nby ancient lavas that, because of the poor conductivity of the\r\nrock, still remain hot beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nOLD FAITHFUL, one of the many geysers of the Yellowstone National\r\nPark, plays a fountain of boiling water a hundred feet in air;\r\nwhile clouds of vapor from the escaping steam ascend to several\r\ntimes that height. The eruptions take place at intervals of from\r\nseventy to ninety minutes. In repose the geyser is a quiet pool,\r\noccupying a craterlike depression in a conical mound some twelve\r\nfeet high. The conduit of the spring is too irregular to be\r\nsounded. The mound is composed of porous silica deposited by the\r\nwaters of the geyser.\r\n\r\nGeysers erupt at intervals instead of continuously boiling,\r\nbecause their long, narrow, and often tortuous conduits do not\r\npermit a free circulation of the water. After an eruption the tube\r\nis refilled and the water again gradually becomes heated. Deep in\r\nthe tube where it is in contact with hot lavas the water sooner or\r\nlater reaches the boiling point, and bursting into steam shoots\r\nthe water above it high in air.\r\n\r\nCARBONATED SPRINGS. After all the other signs of life have gone,\r\nthe ancient volcano may emit carbon dioxide as its dying breath.\r\nThe springs of the region may long be charged with carbon dioxide,\r\nor carbonated, and where they rise through limestone may be\r\nexpected to deposit large quantities of travertine. We should\r\nremember, however, that many carbonated springs, and many hot\r\nsprings, are wholly independent of volcanoes.\r\n\r\nTHE DESTRUCTION OF THE CONE. As soon as the volcanic cone ceases\r\nto grow by eruptions the agents of erosion begin to wear it down,\r\nand the length of time that has elapsed since the period of active\r\ngrowth may be roughly measured by the degree to which the cone has\r\nbeen dissected. We infer that Mount Shasta, whose conical shape is\r\nstill preserved despite the gullies one thousand feet deep which\r\ntrench its sides, is younger than Mount Hood, which erosive\r\nagencies have carved to a pyramidal form. The pile of materials\r\naccumulated about a volcanic vent, no matter how vast in bulk, is\r\nat last swept entirely away. The cone of the volcano, active or\r\nextinct, is not old as the earth counts time; volcanoes are short-\r\nlived geological phenomena.\r\n\r\nCRANDALL VOLCANO. This name is given to a dissected ancient\r\nvolcano in the Yellowstone National Park, which once, it is\r\nestimated, reared its head thousands of feet above the surrounding\r\ncountry and greatly exceeded in bulk either Mount Shasta or Mount\r\nEtna. Not a line of the original mountain remains; all has been\r\nswept away by erosion except some four thousand feet of the base\r\nof the pile. This basal wreck now appears as a rugged region about\r\nthirty miles in diameter, trenched by deep valleys and cut into\r\nsharp peaks and precipitous ridges. In the center of the area is\r\nfound the nucleus (N, Fig. 237),--a mass of coarsely crystalline\r\nrock that congealed deep in the old volcanic pipe. From it there\r\nradiate in all directions, like the spokes of a wheel, long dikes\r\nwhose rock grows rapidly finer of grain as it leaves the vicinity\r\nof the once heated core. The remainder of the base of the ancient\r\nmountain is made of rudely bedded tuffs and volcanic breccia, with\r\noccasional flows of lava, some of the fragments of the breccia\r\nmeasuring as much as twenty feet in diameter. On the sides of\r\ncanyons the breccia is carved by rain erosion to fantastic\r\npinnacles. At different levels in the midst of these beds of tuff\r\nand lava are many old forest grounds. The stumps and trunks of the\r\ntrees, now turned to stone, still in many cases stand upright\r\nwhere once they grew on the slopes of the mountain as it was\r\nbuilding (Fig. 238). The great size and age of some of these trees\r\nindicate, the lapse of time between the eruption whose lavas or\r\ntuffs weathered to the soil on which they grew and the subsequent\r\neruption which buried them beneath showers of stones and ashes.\r\n\r\nNear the edge of the area lies Death Gulch, in which carbon\r\ndioxide is given off in such quantities that in quiet weather it\r\naccumulates in a heavy layer along the ground and suffocates the\r\nanimals which may enter it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nUNDERGROUND STRUCTURES OF IGNEOUS ORIGIN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is because long-continued erosion lays bare the innermost\r\nanatomy of an extinct volcano, and even sweeps away the entire\r\npile with much of the underlying strata, thus leaving the very\r\nroots of the volcano open to view, that we are able to study\r\nunderground volcanic structures. With these we include, for\r\nconvenience, intrusions of molten rock which have been driven\r\nupward into the crust, but which may not have succeeded in\r\nbreaking way to the surface and establishing a volcano. All these\r\nstructures are built of rock forced when in a fluid or pasty state\r\ninto some cavity which it has found or made, and we may classify\r\nthem therefore, according to the shape of the molds in which the\r\nmolten rock has congealed, as (1) dikes, (2) volcanic necks, (3)\r\nintrusive sheets, and (4) intrusive masses.\r\n\r\nDIKES. The sheet of once molten rock with which a fissure has been\r\nfilled is known as a dike. Dikes are formed when volcanic cones\r\nare rent by explosions or by the weight of the lava column in the\r\nduct, and on the dissection of the pile they appear as radiating\r\nvertical ribs cutting across the layers of lava and tuff of which\r\nthe cone is built. In regions undergoing deformation rocks lying\r\ndeep below the ground are often broken and the fissures are filled\r\nwith molten rock from beneath, which finds no outlet to the\r\nsurface. Such dikes are common in areas of the most ancient rocks,\r\nwhich have been brought to light by long erosion.\r\n\r\nIn exceptional cases dikes may reach the length of fifty or one\r\nhundred miles. They vary in width from a fraction of a foot to\r\neven as much as three hundred feet.\r\n\r\nDikes are commonly more fine of grain on the sides than in the\r\ncenter, and may have a glassy and crackled surface where they meet\r\nthe inclosing rock. Can you account for this on any principle\r\nwhich you have learned?\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC NECKS. The pipe of a volcano rises from far below the\r\nbase of the cone,--from the deep reservoir from which its\r\neruptions are supplied. When the volcano has become extinct this\r\ngreat tube remains filled with hardened lava. It forms a\r\ncylindrical core of solid rock, except for some distance below the\r\nancient crater, where it may contain a mass of fragments which had\r\nfallen back into the chimney after being hurled into the air.\r\n\r\nAs the mountain is worn down, this central column known as the\r\nVOLCANIC NECK is left standing as a conical hill (Fig. 240). Even\r\nwhen every other trace of the volcano has been swept away, erosion\r\nwill not have passed below this great stalk on which the volcano\r\nwas borne as a fiery flower whose site it remains to mark. In\r\nvolcanic regions of deep denudation volcanic necks rise solitary\r\nand abrupt from the surrounding country as dome-shaped hills. They\r\nare marked features in the landscape in parts of Scotland and in\r\nthe St. Lawrence valley about Montreal (Fig. 241).\r\n\r\nINTRUSIVE SHEETS. Sheets of igneous rocks are sometimes found\r\ninterleaved with sedimentary strata, especially in regions where\r\nthe rocks have been deformed and have suffered from volcanic\r\naction. In some instances such a sheet is seen to be\r\nCONTEMPORANEOUS (p. 248). In other instances the sheet must be\r\nINTRUSIVE. The overlying stratum, as well as that beneath, has\r\nbeen affected by the heat of the once molten rock. We infer that\r\nthe igneous rock when in a molten state was forced between the\r\nstrata, much as a card may be pushed between the leaves of a\r\nclosed book. The liquid wedged its way between the layers, lifting\r\nthose above to make room for itself. The source of the intrusive\r\nsheet may often be traced to some dike (known therefore as the\r\nFEEDING DIKE), or to some mass of igneous rock.\r\n\r\nIntrusive sheets may extend a score and more of miles, and, like\r\nthe longest surface flows, the most extensive sheets consist of\r\nthe more fusible and fluid lavas,--those of the basic class of\r\nwhich basalt is an example. Intrusive sheets are usually harder\r\nthan the strata in which they lie and are therefore often left in\r\nrelief after long denudation of the region (Fig. 315).\r\n\r\nOn the west bank of the Hudson there extends from New York Bay\r\nnorth for thirty miles a bold cliff several hundred feet high,--\r\nthe PALISADES OF THE HUDSON. It is the outcropping edge of a sheet\r\nof ancient igneous rock, which rests on stratified sandstones and\r\nis overlain by strata of the same series. Sandstones and lava\r\nsheet together dip gently to the west arid the latter disappears\r\nfrom view two miles back from the river.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting question whether the Palisades sheet is\r\nCONTEMPORANEOUS or INTRUSIVE. Was it outpoured on the sandstones\r\nbeneath it when they formed the floor of the sea, and covered\r\nforthwith by the sediments of the strata above, or was it intruded\r\namong these beds at a later date?\r\n\r\nThe latter is the case: for the overlying stratum is intensely\r\nbaked along the zone of contact. At the west edge of the sheet is\r\nfound the dike in which the lava rose to force its way far and\r\nwide between the strata.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC PEAK, one of the prominent mountains of the Yellowstone\r\nNational Park, is carved out of a mass of strata into which many\r\nsheets of molten rock have been intruded. The western summit\r\nconsists of such a sheet several hundred feet thick. Studying the\r\nsection of Figure 244, what inference do you draw as to the source\r\nof these intrusive sheets?\r\n\r\nINTRUSIVE MASSES\r\n\r\nBOSSES. This name is generally applied to huge irregular masses of\r\ncoarsely crystalline igneous rock lying in the midst of other\r\nformations. Bosses vary greatly in size and may reach scores of\r\nmiles in extent. Seldom are there any evidences found that bosses\r\never had connection with the surface. On the other hand, it is\r\noften proved that they have been driven, or have melted their way,\r\nupward into the formations in which they lie; for they give off\r\ndikes and intrusive sheets, and have profoundly altered the rocks\r\nabout them by their heat.\r\n\r\nThe texture of the rock of bosses proves that consolidation\r\nproceeded slowly and at great depths, and it is only because of\r\nvast denudation that they are now exposed to view. Bosses are\r\ncommonly harder than the rocks about them, and stand up,\r\ntherefore, as rounded hills and mountainous ridges long after the\r\nsurrounding country has worn to a low plain.\r\n\r\nThe base of bosses is indefinite or undetermined, and in this\r\nrespect they differ from laccoliths. Some bosses have broken and\r\nfaulted the overlying beds; some have forced the rocks aside and\r\nmelted them away.\r\n\r\nThe SPANISH PEAKS of southeastern Colorado were formed by the\r\nupthrust of immense masses of igneous rock, bulging and breaking\r\nthe overlying strata. On one side of the mountains the throw of\r\nthe fault is nearly a mile, and fragments of deep-lying beds were\r\ndragged upward by the rising masses. The adjacent rocks were\r\naltered by heat to a distance of several thousand feet. No\r\nevidence appears that the molten rock ever reached the surface,\r\nand if volcanic eruptions ever took place either in lava flows or\r\nfragmental materials, all traces of them have been effaced. The\r\nrock of the intrusive masses is coarsely crystalline, and no doubt\r\nsolidified slowly under the pressure of vast thicknesses of\r\noverlying rock, now mostly removed by erosion.\r\n\r\nA magnificent system of dikes radiates from the Peaks to a\r\ndistance of fifteen miles, some now being left by long erosion as\r\nwalls a hundred feet in height (Fig. 239). Intrusive sheets fed by\r\nthe dikes penetrate the surrounding strata, and their edges are\r\ncut by canyons as much as twenty-five miles from the mountain. In\r\nthese strata are valuable beds of lignite, an imperfect coal,\r\nwhich the heat of dikes and sheets has changed to coke.\r\n\r\nLACCOLITHS. The laccolith (Greek laccos, cistern; lithos, stone)\r\nis a variety of intrusive masses in which molten rock has spread\r\nbetween the strata, and, lifting the strata above it to a dome-\r\nshaped form, has collected beneath them in a lens-shaped body with\r\na flat base.\r\n\r\nThe HENRY MOUNTAINS, a small group of detached peaks in southern\r\nUtah, rise from a plateau of horizontal rocks. Some of the peaks\r\nare carved wholly in separate domelike uplifts of the strata of\r\nthe plateau. In others, as Mount Hillers, the largest of the\r\ngroup, there is exposed on the summit a core of igneous rock from\r\nwhich the sedimentary rocks of the flanks dip steeply outward in\r\nall directions. In still others erosion has stripped off the\r\ncovering strata and has laid bare the core to its base; and its\r\nshape is here seen to be that of a plano-convex lens or a baker's\r\nbun, its flat base resting on the undisturbed bedded rocks\r\nbeneath. The structure of Mount Hillers is shown in Figure 248.\r\nThe nucleus of igneous rock is four miles in diameter and more\r\nthan a mile in depth.\r\n\r\nREGIONAL INTRUSIONS. These vast bodies of igneous rock, which may\r\nreach hundreds of miles in diameter, differ little from bosses\r\nexcept in their immense bulk. Like bosses, regional intrusions\r\ngive off dikes and sheets and greatly change the rocks about them\r\nby their heat. They are now exposed to view only because of the\r\nprofound denudation which has removed the upheaved dome of rocks\r\nbeneath which they slowly cooled. Such intrusions are accompanied\r\n--whether as cause or as effect is still hardly known--by\r\ndeformations, and their masses of igneous rock are thus found as\r\nthe core of many great mountain ranges. The granitic masses of\r\nwhich the Bitter Root Mountains and the Sierra Nevadas have been\r\nlargely carved are each more than three hundred miles in length.\r\nImmense regional intrusions, the cores of once lofty mountain\r\nranges, are found upon the Laurentian peneplain.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOGRAPHIC EFFECTS OF INTRUSIVE MASSES. We have already seen\r\nexamples of the topographic effects of intrusive masses in Mount\r\nHillers, the Spanish Peaks, and in the great mountain ranges\r\nmentioned in the paragraph on regional intrusions, although in the\r\nlatter instances these effects are entangled with the effects of\r\nother processes. Masses of igneous rock cannot be intruded within\r\nthe crust without an accompanying deformation on a scale\r\ncorresponding to the bulk of the intruded mass. The overlying\r\nstrata are arched into hills or mountains, or, if the molten\r\nmaterial is of great extent, the strata may conceivably be floated\r\nupward to the height of a plateau. We may suppose that the\r\ntransference of molten matter from one region to another may be\r\namong the causes of slow subsidences and elevations. Intrusions\r\ngive rise to fissures, dikes, and intrusive sheets, and these\r\ndislocations cannot fail to produce earthquakes. Where intrusive\r\nmasses open communication with the surface, volcanoes are\r\nestablished or fissure eruptions occur such as those of Iceland.\r\n\r\nTHE INTRUSIVE ROCKS\r\n\r\nThe igneous rocks are divided into two general classes,--the\r\nVOLCANIC or ERUPTIVE rocks, which have been outpoured in open air\r\nor on the floor of the sea, and the INTRUSIVE rocks, which have\r\nbeen intruded within the rocks of the crust and have solidified\r\nbelow the surface. The two classes are alike in chemical\r\ncomposition and may be divided into acidic and basic groups. In\r\ntexture the intrusive rocks differ from the volcanic rocks because\r\nof the different conditions under which they have solidified. They\r\ncooled far more slowly beneath the cover of the rocks into which\r\nthey were pressed than is permitted to lava flows in open air.\r\nTheir constituent minerals had ample opportunity to sort\r\nthemselves and crystallize from the fluid mixture, and none of\r\nthat mixture was left to congeal as a glassy paste.\r\n\r\nThey consolidated also under pressure. They are never scoriaceous,\r\nfor the steam with which they were charged was not allowed to\r\nexpand and distend them with steam blebs. In the rocks of the\r\nlarger intrusive masses one may see with a powerful microscope\r\nexceedingly minute cavities, to be counted by many millions to the\r\ncubic inch, in which the gaseous water which the mass contained\r\nwas held imprisoned under the immense pressure of the overlying\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nNaturally these characteristics are best developed in the\r\nintrusives which cooled most slowly, i.e. in the deepest-seated\r\nand largest masses; while in those which cooled more rapidly, as\r\nin dikes and sheets, we find gradations approaching the texture of\r\nsurface flows.\r\n\r\nVARIETIES OF THE INTRUSIVE ROCKS. We will now describe a few of\r\nthe varieties of rocks of deep-seated intrusions. All are even\r\ngrained, consisting of a mass of crystalline grains formed during\r\none continuous stage of solidification, and no porphyritic\r\ncrystals appear as in lavas.\r\n\r\nGRANITE, as we have learned already, is composed of three\r\nminerals,--quartz, feldspar, and mica. According to the color of\r\nthe feldspar the rock may be red, or pink, or gray. Hornblende--a\r\nblack or dark green mineral, an iron-magnesian silicate, about as\r\nhard as feldspar--is sometimes found as a fourth constituent, and\r\nthe rock is then known as HORNBLENDIC GRANITE. Granite is an\r\nacidic rock corresponding to rhyolite in chemical composition. We\r\nmay believe that the same molten mass which supplies this acidic\r\nlava in surface flows solidifies as granite deep below ground in\r\nthe volcanic reservoir.\r\n\r\nSYENITE, composed of feldspar and mica, has consolidated from a\r\nless siliceous mixture than has granite.\r\n\r\nDIORITE, still less siliceous, is composed of hornblende and\r\nfeldspar,--the latter mineral being of different variety from the\r\nfeldspar of granite and syenite.\r\n\r\nGABBRO, a typical basic rock, corresponds to basalt in chemical\r\ncomposition. It is a dark, heavy, coarsely crystalline aggregate\r\nof feldspar and AUGITE (a dark mineral allied to hornblende). It\r\noften contains MAGNETITE (the magnetic black oxide of iron) and\r\nOLIVINE (a greenish magnesian silicate).\r\n\r\nIn the northern states all these types, and many others also of\r\nthe vast number of varieties of intrusive rocks, can be found\r\namong the rocks of the drift brought from the areas of igneous\r\nrock in Canada and the states of our northern border.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY. The records of geology prove that since the earliest of\r\ntheir annals tremendous forces have been active in the earth. In\r\nall the past, under pressures inconceivably great, molten rock has\r\nbeen driven upward into the rocks of the crust. It has squeezed\r\ninto fissures forming dikes; it has burrowed among the strata as\r\nintrusive sheets; it has melted the rocks away or lifted the\r\noverlying strata, filling the chambers which it has made with\r\nintrusive masses. During all geological ages molten rock has found\r\nway to the surface, and volcanoes have darkened the sky with\r\nclouds of ashes and poured streams of glowing lava down their\r\nsides. The older strata,--the strata which have been most deeply\r\nburied,--and especially those which have suffered most from\r\nfolding and from fracture, show the largest amount of igneous\r\nintrusions. The molten rock which has been driven from the earth's\r\ninterior to within the crust or to the surface during geologic\r\ntime must be reckoned in millions of cubic miles.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERIOR CONDITION OF THE EARTH AND CAUSES OF VULCANISM AND\r\nDEFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe problems of volcanoes and of deformation are so closely\r\nconnected with that of the earth's interior that we may consider\r\nthem together. Few of these problems are solved, and we may only\r\nstate some known facts and the probable conclusions which may be\r\ndrawn as inferences from them.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH IS HOT. Volcanoes prove that in many\r\nparts of the earth there exist within reach of the surface regions\r\nof such intense heat that the rock is in a molten condition. Deep\r\nwells and mines show everywhere an increase in temperature below\r\nthe surface shell affected by the heat of summer and the cold of\r\nwinter,--a shell in temperate latitudes sixty or seventy feet\r\nthick. Thus in a boring more than a mile deep at Schladebach,\r\nGermany, the earth grows warmer at the rate of 1 degrees F. for\r\nevery sixty-seven feet as we descend. Taking the average rate of\r\nincrease at one degree for every sixty feet of descent, and\r\nassuming that this rate, observed at the moderate distances open\r\nto observation, continues to at least thirty-five miles, the\r\ntemperature at that depth must be more than three thousand\r\ndegrees,--a temperature at which all ordinary rocks would melt at\r\nthe earth's surface. The rate of increase in temperature probably\r\nlessens as we go downward, and it may not be appreciable below a\r\nfew hundred miles. But there is no reason to doubt that THE\r\nINTERIOR OF THE EARTH IS INTENSELY HOT. Below a depth of one or\r\ntwo score miles we may imagine the rocks everywhere glowing with\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nAlthough the heat of the interior is great enough to melt all\r\nrocks at atmospheric pressure, it does not follow that the\r\ninterior is fluid. Pressure raises the fusing point of rocks, and\r\nthe weight of the crust may keep the interior in what may be\r\ncalled a solid state, although so hot as to be a liquid or a gas\r\nwere the pressure to be removed.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH IS RIGID AND HEAVY. The earth behaves as\r\na globe more rigid than glass under the attractions of the sun and\r\nmoon. It is not deformed by these stresses as is the ocean in the\r\ntides, proving that it is not a fluid ball covered with a yielding\r\ncrust a few miles thick. Earthquakes pass through the earth faster\r\nthan they would were it of solid steel. Hence the rocks of the\r\ninterior are highly elastic, being brought by pressure to a\r\ncompact, continuous condition unbroken by the cracks and vesicles\r\nof surface rocks. THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH IS RIGID\r\n\r\nThe common rocks of the crust are about two and a half times\r\nheavier than water, while the earth as a whole weighs five and\r\nsix-tenths times as much as a globe of water of the same size. THE\r\nINTERIOR IS THEREFORE MUCH MORE HEAVY THAN THE CRUST. This may be\r\ncaused in part by compression of the interior under the enormous\r\nweight of the crust, and in part also by an assortment of\r\nmaterial, the heavier substances, such as the heavy metals, having\r\ngravitated towards the center.\r\n\r\nBetween the crust, which is solid because it is cool, and the\r\ninterior, which is hot enough to melt were it not for the pressure\r\nwhich keeps it dense and rigid, there may be an intermediate zone\r\nin which heat and pressure are so evenly balanced that here rock\r\nliquefies whenever and wherever the pressure upon it may be\r\nrelieved by movements of the crust. It is perhaps from such a\r\nsubcrustal layer that the lava of volcanoes is supplied.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES OF VOLCANIC ACTION. It is now generally believed that\r\nthe HEAT of volcanoes is that of the earth's interior. Other\r\ncauses, such as friction and crushing in the making of mountains\r\nand the chemical reactions between oxidizing agents of the crust\r\nand the unoxidized interior, have been suggested, but to most\r\ngeologists they seem inadequate.\r\n\r\nThere is much difference of opinion as to the FORCE which causes\r\nmolten rock to rise to the surface in the ducts of volcanoes.\r\nSteam is so evidently concerned in explosive eruptions that many\r\nbelieve that lava is driven upward by the expansive force of the\r\nsteam with which it is charged, much as a viscid liquid rises and\r\nboils over in a test tube or kettle.\r\n\r\nBut in quiet eruptions, and still more in the irruption of\r\nintrusive sheets and masses, there is little if any evidence that\r\nsteam is the driving force. It is therefore believed by many\r\ngeologists that it is PRESSURE DUE TO CRUSTAL MOVEMENTS AND\r\nINTERNAL STRESSES which squeezes molten rock from below into\r\nfissures and ducts in the crust. It is held by some that where\r\nconsiderable water is supplied to the rising column of lava, as\r\nfrom the ground water of the surrounding region, and where the\r\nlava is viscid so that steam does not readily escape, the eruption\r\nis of the explosive type; when these conditions do not obtain, the\r\nlava outwells quietly, as in the Hawaiian volcanoes. It is held by\r\nothers not only that volcanoes are due to the outflow of the\r\nearth's deep-seated heat, but also that the steam and other\r\nemitted gases are for the most part native to the earth's interior\r\nand never have had place in the circulation of atmospheric and\r\nground waters.\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC ACTION AND DEFORMATION. Volcanoes do not occur on wide\r\nplains or among ancient mountains. On the other hand, where\r\nmovements of the earth's crust are in progress in the uplift of\r\nhigh plateaus, and still more in mountain making, molten rock may\r\nreach the surface, or may be driven upward toward it forming great\r\nintrusive masses. Thus extensive lava flows accompanied the\r\nupheaval of the block mountains of western North America and the\r\nuplift of the Colorado plateau. A line of recent volcanoes may be\r\ntraced along the system of rift valleys which extends from the\r\nJordan and Dead Sea through eastern Africa to Lake Nyassa. The\r\nvolcanoes of the Andes show how conspicuous volcanic action may be\r\nin young rising ranges. Folded mountains often show a core of\r\nigneous rock, which by long erosion has come to form the axis and\r\nthe highest peaks of the range, as if the molten rock had been\r\nsqueezed up under the rising upfolds. As we decipher the records\r\nof the rocks in historical geology we shall see more fully how, in\r\nall the past, volcanic action has characterized the periods of\r\ngreat crustal movements, and how it has been absent when and where\r\nthe earth's crust has remained comparatively at rest.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES OF DEFORMATION. As the earth's interior, or nucleus, is\r\nhighly heated it must be constantly though slowly losing its heat\r\nby conduction through the crust and into space; and since the\r\nnucleus is cooling it must also be contracting. The nucleus has\r\ncontracted also because of the extrusion of molten matter, the\r\nloss of constituent gases given off in volcanic eruptions, and\r\n(still more important) the compression and consolidation of its\r\nmaterial under gravity. As the nucleus contracts, it tends to draw\r\naway from the cooled and solid crust, and the latter settles,\r\nadapting itself to the shrinking nucleus much as the skin of a\r\nwithering apple wrinkles down upon the shrunken fruit. The\r\nunsupported weight of the spherical crust develops enormous\r\ntangential pressures, similar to the stresses of an arch or dome,\r\nand when these lateral thrusts accumulate beyond the power of\r\nresistance the solid rock is warped and folded and broken.\r\n\r\nSince the planet attained its present mass it has thus been\r\nlessening in volume. Notwithstanding local and relative upheavals\r\nthe earth's surface on the whole has drawn nearer and nearer to\r\nthe center. The portions of the lithosphere which have been\r\ncarried down the farthest have received the waters of the oceans,\r\nwhile those portions which have been carried down the least have\r\nemerged as continents.\r\n\r\nAlthough it serves our convenience to refer the movements of the\r\ncrust to the sea level as datum plane, it is understood that this\r\nlevel is by no means fixed. Changes in the ocean basins increase\r\nor reduce their capacity and thus lower or raise the level of the\r\nsea. But since these basins are connected, the effect of any\r\nchange upon the water level is so distributed that it is far less\r\nnoticeable than a corresponding change would be upon the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nMETAMORPHISM AND MINERAL VEINS\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the action of internal agencies rocks of all kinds may be\r\nrendered harder, more firmly cemented, and more crystalline. These\r\nprocesses are known as METAMORPHISM, and the rocks affected,\r\nwhether originally sedimentary or igneous, are called METAMORPHIC\r\nROCKS. We may contrast with metamorphism the action of external\r\nagencies in weathering, which render rocks less coherent by\r\ndissolving their soluble parts and breaking down their crystalline\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nCONTACT METAMORPHISM. Rocks beneath a lava flow or in contact with\r\nigneous intrusions are found to be metamorphosed to various\r\ndegrees by the heat of the cooling mass. The adjacent strata may\r\nbe changed only in color, hardness, and texture. Thus, next to a\r\ndike, bituminous coal may be baked to coke or anthracite, and\r\nchalk and limestone to crystalline marble. Sandstone may be\r\nconverted into quartzite, and shale into ARGILLITE, a compact,\r\nmassive clay rock. New minerals may also be developed. In\r\nsedimentary rocks there may be produced crystals of mica and of\r\nGARNET (a mineral as hard as quartz, commonly occurring in red,\r\ntwelve-sided crystals). Where the changes are most profound, rocks\r\nmay be wholly made over in structure and mineral composition.\r\n\r\nIn contact metamorphism, thin sheets of molten rock produce less\r\neffect than thicker ones. The strongest heat effects are naturally\r\ncaused by bosses and regional intrusions, and the zone of change\r\nabout them may be several miles in width. In these changes heated\r\nwaters and vapors from the masses of igneous rocks undoubtedly\r\nplay a very important part.\r\n\r\nWhich will be more strongly altered, the rocks about a closed dike\r\nin which lava began to cool as soon as it filled the fissure, or\r\nthe rocks about a dike which opened on the surface and through\r\nwhich the molten rock flowed for some time?\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the part played by heated waters, which\r\nwill produce the most far-reaching metamorphism, dikes which cut\r\nacross the bedding planes or intrusive sheets which are thrust\r\nbetween the strata?\r\n\r\nREGIONAL METAMORPHISM. Metamorphic rocks occur wide-spread in many\r\nregions, often hundreds of square miles in area, where such\r\nextensive changes cannot be accounted for by igneous intrusions.\r\nSuch are the dissected cores of lofty mountains, as the Alps, and\r\nthe worn-down bases of ancient ranges, as in New England, large\r\nareas in the Piedmont Belt, and the Laurentian peneplain.\r\n\r\nIn these regions the rocks have yielded to immense pressure. They\r\nhave been folded, crumpled, and mashed, and even their minute\r\ngrains, as one may see with a microscope, have often been\r\npuckered, broken, and crushed to powder. It is to these mechanical\r\nmovements and strains which the rocks have suffered in every part\r\nthat we may attribute their metamorphism, and the degree to which\r\nthey have been changed is in direct proportion to the degree to\r\nwhich they have been deformed and mashed.\r\n\r\nOther factors, however, have played important parts. Rock crushing\r\ndevelops heat, and allows a freer circulation of heated waters and\r\nvapors. Thus chemical reactions are greatly quickened; minerals\r\nare dissolved and redeposited in new positions, or their chemical\r\nconstituents may recombine in new minerals, entirely changing the\r\nnature of the rock, as when, for example, feldspar recrystallizes\r\nas quartz and mica.\r\n\r\nEarly stages of metamorphism are seen in SLATE. Pressure has\r\nhardened the marine muds, the arkose, or the volcanic ash from\r\nwhich slates are derived, and has caused them to cleave by the\r\nrearrangement of their particles.\r\n\r\nUnder somewhat greater pressure, slate becomes PHYLLITE, a clay\r\nslate whose cleavage surfaces are lustrous with flat-lying mica\r\nflakes. The same pressure which has caused the rock to cleave has\r\nset free some of its mineral constituents along the cleavage\r\nplanes to crystallize there as mica.\r\n\r\nFOLIATION. Under still stronger pressure the whole structure of\r\nthe rock is altered. The minerals of which it is composed, and the\r\nnew minerals which develop by heat and pressure, arrange\r\nthemselves along planes of cleavage or of shear in rudely parallel\r\nleaves, or FOLIA. Of this structure, called FOLIATION, we may\r\ndistinguish two types,--a coarser feldspathic type, and a fine\r\ntype in which other minerals than feldspar predominate.\r\n\r\nGNEISS is the general name under which are comprised coarsely\r\nfoliated rocks banded with irregular layers of feldspar and other\r\nminerals. The gneisses appear to be due in many cases to the\r\ncrushing and shearing of deep-seated igneous rocks, such as\r\ngranite and gabbro.\r\n\r\nTHE CRYSTALLINE SCHISTS, representing the finer types of\r\nfoliation, consist of thin, parallel, crystalline leaves, which\r\nare often remarkably crumpled. These folia can be distinguished\r\nfrom the laminae of sedimentary rocks by their lenticular form and\r\nlack of continuity, and especially by the fact that they consist\r\nof platy, crystalline grains, and not of particles rounded by\r\nwear.\r\n\r\nMICA SCHIST, the most common of schists, and in fact of all\r\nmetamorphic rocks, is composed of mica and quartz in alternating\r\nwavy folia. All gradations between it and phyllite may be traced,\r\nand in many cases we may prove it due to the metamorphism of\r\nslates and shales. It is widespread in New England and along the\r\neastern side of the Appalachians. TALC SCHIST consists of quartz\r\nand TALC, a light-colored magnesian mineral of greasy feel, and so\r\nsoft that it can be scratched with the thumb nail.\r\n\r\nHORNBLENDE SCHIST, resulting in many cases from the foliation of\r\nbasic igneous rocks, is made of folia of hornblende alternating\r\nwith bands of quartz and feldspar. Hornblende schist is common\r\nover large areas in the Lake Superior region.\r\n\r\nQUARTZ SCHIST is produced from quartzite by the development of\r\nfine folia of mica along planes of shear. All gradations may be\r\nfound between it and unfoliated quartzite on the one hand and mica\r\nschist on the other.\r\n\r\nUnder the resistless pressure of crustal movements almost any\r\nrocks, sandstones, shales, lavas of all kinds, granites, diorites,\r\nand gabbros may be metamorphosed into schists by crushing and\r\nshearing. Limestones, however, are metamorphosed by pressure into\r\nmarble, the grains of carbonate of lime recrystallizing freely to\r\ninterlocking crystals of calcite.\r\n\r\nThese few examples must suffice of the great class of metamorphic\r\nrocks. As we have seen, they owe their origin to the alteration of\r\nboth of the other classes of rocks--the sedimentary and the\r\nigneous--by heat and pressure, assisted usually by the presence of\r\nwater. The fact of change is seen in their hardness arid\r\ncementation, their more or less complete recrystallization, and\r\ntheir foliation; but the change is often so complete that no trace\r\nof their original structure and mineral composition remains to\r\ntell whether the rocks from which they were derived were\r\nsedimentary or igneous, or to what variety of either of these\r\nclasses they belonged.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, however, the early history of a metamorphic rock\r\ncan be deciphered. Fossils not wholly obliterated may prove it\r\noriginally water-laid. Schists may contain rolled-out pebbles,\r\nshowing their derivation from a conglomerate. Dikes of igneous\r\nrocks may be followed into a region where they have been foliated\r\nby pressure. The most thoroughly metamorphosed rocks may sometimes\r\nbe traced out into unaltered sedimentary or igneous rocks, or\r\namong them may be found patches of little change where their\r\nhistory maybe read.\r\n\r\nMetamorphism is most common among rocks of the earlier geological\r\nages, and most rare among rocks of recent formation. No doubt it\r\nis now in progress where deep-buried sediments are invaded\r\nby heat either from intrusive igneous masses or from the earth's\r\ninterior, or are suffering slow deformation under the thrust of\r\nmountain-making forces.\r\n\r\nSuggest how rocks now in process of metamorphism may sometimes be\r\nexposed to view. Why do metamorphic rocks appear on the surface\r\nto-day?\r\n\r\nMINERAL VEINS\r\n\r\nIn regions of folded and broken rocks fissures are frequently\r\nfound to be filled with sheets of crystalline minerals deposited\r\nfrom solution by underground water, and fissures thus filled are\r\nknown as mineral veins. Much of the importance of mineral veins is\r\ndue to the fact that they are often metalliferous, carrying\r\nvaluable native metals and metallic ores disseminated in fine\r\nparticles, in strings, and sometimes in large masses in the midst\r\nof the valueless nonmetallic minerals which make up what is known\r\nas the VEIN STONE.\r\n\r\nThe most common vein stones are QUARTZ and CALCITE. FLUORITE\r\n(calcium fluoride), a mineral harder than calcite and\r\ncrystallizing in cubes of various colors, and BARITE (barium\r\nsulphate), a heavy white mineral, are abundant in many veins.\r\n\r\nThe gold-bearing quartz veins of California traverse the\r\nmetamorphic slates of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Below the zone\r\nof solution (p. 45) these veins consist of a vein stone of quartz\r\nmingled with pyrite (p. 13), the latter containing threads and\r\ngrains of native gold. But to the depth of about fifty feet from\r\nthe surface the pyrite of the vein has been dissolved, leaving a\r\nrusty, cellular quartz with grains of the insoluble gold scattered\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\nThe PLACER DEPOSITS of California and other regions are gold-\r\nbearing deposits of gravel and sand in river beds. The heavy gold\r\nis apt to be found mostly near or upon the solid rock, and its\r\ngrains, like those of the sand, are always rounded. How the gold\r\ncame in the placers we may leave the pupil to suggest.\r\n\r\nCopper is found in a number of ores, and also in the native metal.\r\nBelow the zone of surface changes the ore of a copper vein is\r\noften a double sulphide of iron and copper called CHALCOPYRITE, a\r\nmineral softer than pyrite--it can easily be scratched with a\r\nknife--and deeper yellow in color. For several score of feet below\r\nthe ground the vein may consist of rusty quartz from which the\r\nmetallic ores have been dissolved; but at the base of the zone of\r\nsolution we may find exceedingly rich deposits of copper ores,--\r\ncopper sulphides, red and black copper oxides, and green and blue\r\ncopper carbonates, which have clearly been brought down in\r\nsolution from the leached upper portion of the vein.\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF MINERAL VEINS. Both vein stones and ores have been\r\ndeposited slowly from solution in water, much as crystals of salt\r\nare deposited on the sides of a jar of saturated brine. In our\r\nstudy of underground water we learned that it is everywhere\r\ncirculating through the permeable rocks of the crust, descending\r\nto profound depths under the action of gravity and again driven to\r\nthe surface by hydrostatic pressure. Now fissures, wherever they\r\noccur, form the trunk channels of the underground circulation.\r\nWater descends from the surface along these rifts; it moves\r\nlaterally from either side to the fissure plane, just as ground\r\nwater seeps through the surrounding rocks from every direction to\r\na well; and it ascends through these natural water ways as in an\r\nartesian well, whenever they intersect an aquifer in which water\r\nis under hydrostatic pressure.\r\n\r\nThe waters which deposit vein stones and ores are commonly hot,\r\nand in many cases they have derived their heat from intrusions of\r\nigneous rock still uncooled within the crust. The solvent power of\r\nthe water is thus greatly increased, and it takes up into solution\r\nvarious substances from the igneous and sedimentary rocks which it\r\ntraverses. For various reasons these substances stances are\r\ndeposited in the vein as ores and vein stones. On rising through\r\nthe fissure the water cools and loses pressure, and its capacity\r\nto hold minerals in solution is therefore lessened. Besides, as\r\ndifferent currents meet in the fissure, some ascending, some\r\ndescending, and some coming in from the sides, the chemical\r\nreaction of these various weak solutions upon one another and upon\r\nthe walls of the vein precipitates the minerals of vein stuffs and\r\nores.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the method of vein deposits we may cite the\r\ncase of a wooden box pipe used in the Comstock mines, Nevada, to\r\ncarry the hot water of the mine from one level to another, which\r\nin ten years was lined with calcium carbonate more than half an\r\ninch thick.\r\n\r\nThe Steamboat Springs, Nevada, furnish examples of mineral veins\r\nin process of formation. The steaming water rises through fissures\r\nin volcanic rocks and is now depositing in the rifts a vein stone\r\nof quartz, with metallic ores of iron, mercury, lead, and other\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\nRECONCENTRATION. Near the base of the zone of solution veins are\r\noften stored with exceptionally large and valuable ore deposits.\r\nThis local enrichment of the vein is due to the reconcentration of\r\nits metalliferous ores. As the surface of the land is slowly\r\nlowered by weathering and running water, the zone of solution is\r\nlowered at an equal rate and encroaches constantly on the zone of\r\ncementation. The minerals of veins are therefore constantly being\r\ndissolved along their upper portions and carried down the fissures\r\nby ground water to lower levels, where they are redeposited.\r\n\r\nMany of the richest ore deposits are thus due to successive\r\nconcentrations: the ores were leached originally from the rocks to\r\na large extent by laterally seeping waters; they were concentrated\r\nin the ore deposits of the vein chiefly by ascending currents;\r\nthey have been reconcentrated by descending waters in the way just\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF THE METALS. It is to the igneous rocks that\r\nwe may look for the original source of the metals of veins. Lavas\r\ncontain minute percentages of various metallic compounds, and no\r\ndoubt this was the case also with the igneous rocks which formed\r\nthe original earth crust. By the erosion of the igneous rocks the\r\nmetals have been distributed among sedimentary strata, and even\r\nthe sea has taken into solution an appreciable amount of gold and\r\nother metals, but in this widely diffused condition they are\r\nwholly useless to man. The concentration which has made them\r\navailable is due to the interaction of many agencies. Earth\r\nmovements fracturing deeply the rocks of the crust, the intrusion\r\nof heated masses, the circulation of underground waters, have all\r\ncooperated in the concentration of the metals of mineral veins.\r\n\r\nWhile fissure veins are the most important of mineral veins, the\r\nlatter term is applied also to any water way which has been filled\r\nby similar deposits from solution. Thus in soluble rocks, such as\r\nlimestones, joints enlarged by percolating water are sometimes\r\nfilled with metalliferous deposits, as, for example, the lead and\r\nzinc deposits of the upper Mississippi valley. Even a porous\r\naquifer may be made the seat of mineral deposits, as in the case\r\nof some copper-bearing and silver-bearing sandstones of New\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL GEOLOGY\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE GEOLOGICAL RECORD\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT A FORMATION RECORDS. We have already learned that each\r\nindividual body of stratified rock, or formation, constitutes a\r\nrecord of the time when it was laid. The structure and the\r\ncharacter of the sediments of each formation tell whether the area\r\nwas land or sea at the time when they were spread; and if the\r\nformer, whether the land was river plain, or lake bed, or was\r\ncovered with wind-blown sands, or by the deposits of an ice sheet.\r\nIf the sediments are marine, we may know also whether they were\r\nlaid in shoal water near the shore or in deeper water out at sea,\r\nand whether during a period of emergence, or during a period of\r\nsubsidence when the sea transgressed the land. By the same means\r\neach formation records the stage in the cycle of erosion of the\r\nland mass from which its sediments were derived. An unconformity\r\nbetween two marine formations records the fact that between the\r\nperiods when they were deposited in the sea the area emerged as\r\nland and suffered erosion. The attitude and structure of the\r\nstrata tell also of the foldings and fractures, the deformation\r\nand the metamorphism, which they have suffered; and the igneous\r\nrocks associated with them as lava flows and igneous intrusions\r\nadd other details to the story. Each formation is thus a separate\r\nlocal chapter in the geological history of the earth, and its\r\nstrata are its leaves. It contains an authentic record of the\r\nphysical conditions--the geography--of the time and place when and\r\nwhere its sediments were laid.\r\n\r\nPAST CYCLES OF EROSION. These chapters in the history of the\r\nplanet are very numerous, although much of the record has been\r\ndestroyed in various ways. A succession of different formations is\r\nusually seen in any considerable section of the crust, such as a\r\ndeep canyon or where the edges of upturned strata are exposed to\r\nview on the flanks of mountain ranges; and in any extensive area,\r\nsuch as a state of the Union or a province of Canada, the number\r\nof formations outcropping on the surface is large.\r\n\r\nIt is thus learned that our present continent is made up for. the\r\nmost part of old continental deltas. Some, recently emerged as the\r\nstrata of young coastal plains, are the records of recent cycles\r\nof erosion; while others were deposited in the early history of\r\nthe earth, and in many instances have been crumpled into\r\nmountains, which afterwards were leveled to their bases and\r\nlowered beneath the sea to receive a cover of later sediments\r\nbefore they were again uplifted to form land.\r\n\r\nThe cycle of erosion now in progress and recorded in the layers of\r\nstratified rock being spread beneath the sea in continental deltas\r\nhas therefore been preceded by many similar cycles. Again and\r\nagain movements of the crust have brought to an end one cycle--\r\nsometimes when only well under way, and sometimes when drawing\r\ntoward its close--and have begun another. Again and again they\r\nhave added to the land areas which before were sea, with all their\r\ndeposition records of earlier cycles, or have lowered areas of\r\nland beneath the sea to receive new sediments.\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF THE EARTH. The thickness of the stratified rocks now\r\nexposed upon the eroded surface of the continents is very great.\r\nIn the Appalachian region the strata are seven or eight miles\r\nthick, and still greater thicknesses have been measured in several\r\nother mountain ranges. The aggregate thickness of all the\r\nformations of the stratified rocks of the earth's crust, giving to\r\neach formation its maximum thickness wherever found, amounts to\r\nnot less than forty miles. Knowing how slowly sediments accumulate\r\nupon the sea floor, we must believe that the successive cycles\r\nwhich the earth has seen stretch back into a past almost\r\ninconceivably remote, and measure tens of millions and perhaps\r\neven hundreds of millions of years.\r\n\r\nHOW THE FORMATIONS ARE CORRELATED AND THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD MADE\r\nUP. Arranged in the order of their succession, the formations of\r\nthe earth's crust would constitute a connected record in which the\r\ngeological history of the planet may be read, and therefore known\r\nas the GEOLOGICAL RECORD. But to arrange the formations in their\r\nnatural order is not an easy task. A complete set of the volumes\r\nof the record is to be found in no single region. Their leaves and\r\nchapters are scattered over the land surface of the globe. In one\r\narea certain chapters may be found, though perhaps with many\r\nmissing leaves, and with intervening chapters wanting, and these\r\nabsent parts perhaps can be supplied only after long search\r\nthrough many other regions.\r\n\r\nAdjacent strata in any region are arranged according to the LAW OF\r\nSUPERPOSITION, i.e. any stratum is younger than that on which it\r\nwas deposited, just as in a pile of paper, any sheet was laid\r\nlater than that on which it rests. Where rocks have been\r\ndisturbed, their original attitude must be determined before the\r\nlaw can be applied. Nor can the law of superposition be used in\r\nidentifying and comparing the strata of different regions where\r\nthe formations cannot be traced continuously from one region to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThe formations of different regions are arranged in their true\r\norder by the LAW OF INCLUDED ORGANISMS; i.e. formations, however\r\nwidely separated, which contain a similar assemblage of fossils\r\nare equivalent and belong to the same division of geological time.\r\n\r\nThe correlation of formations by means of fossils may be explained\r\nby the formations now being deposited about the north Atlantic.\r\nLithologically they are extremely various. On the continental\r\nshelf of North America limestones of different kinds are forming\r\noff Florida, and sandstones and shales from Georgia northward.\r\nSeparated from them by the deep Atlantic oozes are other\r\nsedimentary deposits now accumulating along the west coast of\r\nEurope. If now all these offshore formations were raised to open\r\nair, how could they be correlated? Surely not by lithological\r\nlikeness, for in this respect they would be quite diverse. All\r\nwould be similar, however, in the fossils which they contain. Some\r\nfossil species would be identical in all these formations and\r\nothers would be closely allied. Making all due allowance for\r\ndifferences in species due to local differences in climate and\r\nother physical causes, it would still be plain that plants and\r\nanimals so similar lived at the same period of time, and that the\r\nformations in which their remains were imbedded were\r\ncontemporaneous in a broad way. The presence of the bones of\r\nwhales and other marine mammals would prove that the strata were\r\nlaid after the appearance of mammals upon earth, and imbedded\r\nrelics of man would give a still closer approximation to their\r\nage. In the same way we correlate the earlier geological\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nFor example, in 1902 there were collected the first fossils ever\r\nfound on the antarctic continent. Among the dozen specimens\r\nobtained were some fossil ammonites (a family of chambered shells)\r\nof genera which are found on other continents in certain\r\nformations classified as the Cretaceous system, and which occur\r\nneither above these formations nor below them. On the basis of\r\nthese few fossils we may be confident that the strata in which\r\nthey were found in the antarctic region were laid in the same\r\nperiod of geologic time as were the Cretaceous rocks of the United\r\nStates and Canada.\r\n\r\nTHE RECORD AS A TIME SCALE. By means of the law of included\r\norganisms and the law of superposition the formations of different\r\ncountries and continents are correlated and arranged in their\r\nnatural order. When the geological record is thus obtained it may\r\nbe used as a universal time scale for geological history.\r\nGeological time is separated into divisions corresponding to the\r\ntimes during which the successive formations were laid. The\r\nlargest assemblages of formations are known as groups, while the\r\ncorresponding divisions of time are known as eras. Groups are\r\nsubdivided into systems, and systems into series. Series are\r\ndivided into stages and substages,--subdivisions which do not\r\nconcern us in this brief treatise. The corresponding divisions of\r\ntime are given in the following table.\r\n\r\nSTRATA     TIME\r\nGroup      Era\r\nSystem     Period\r\nSeries     Epoch\r\n\r\nThe geologist is now prepared to read the physical history--the\r\ngeographical development--of any country or of any continent by\r\nmeans of its formations, when he has given each formation its true\r\nplace in the geological record as a time scale.\r\n\r\nThe following chart exhibits the main divisions of the record, the\r\nname given to each being given also to the corresponding time\r\ndivision. Thus we speak of the CAMBRIAN SYSTEM, meaning a certain\r\nsuccession of formations which are classified together because of\r\nbroad resemblances in their included organisms; and of the\r\nCAMBRIAN PERIOD, meaning the time during which these rocks were\r\ndeposited.\r\n\r\nGroup and Era System and Period Series and Epoch\r\n\r\n               |Quaternary-----|Recent\r\nCenozoic------|                |Pleistocene\r\n               |\r\n               |Tertiary-------|Pliocene\r\n                                |Miocene\r\n                                |Eocene\r\n               |Cretaceous\r\nMesozoic------|Jurassic\r\n               |Triassic\r\n\r\n\r\n                                |Permian\r\n               |Carboniferous--|Pennsylvanian\r\n               |                |Mississippian\r\nPaleozoic-----|Devonian\r\n               |Silurian\r\n               |Ordovician\r\n               |Cambrian\r\n\r\nAlgonkian\r\nArchean\r\n\r\nFOSSILS AND WHAT THEY TEACH\r\n\r\nThe geological formations contain a record still more important\r\nthan that of the geographical development of the continents; the\r\nfossils imbedded in the rocks of each formation tell of the kinds\r\nof animals and plants which inhabited the earth at that time, and\r\nfrom these fossils we are therefore able to construct the history\r\nof life upon the earth.\r\n\r\nFOSSILS. These remains of organisms are found in the strata in all\r\ndegrees of perfection, from trails and tracks and fragmentary\r\nimpressions, to perfectly preserved shells, wood, bones, and\r\ncomplete skeletons. As a rule, it is only the hard parts of\r\nanimals and plants which have left any traces in the rocks.\r\nSometimes the original hard substance is preserved, but more often\r\nit has been replaced by some less soluble material. Petrifaction,\r\nas this process of slow replacement is called, is often carried on\r\nin the most exquisite detail. When wood, for example, is\r\nundergoing petrifaction, the woody tissue may be replaced,\r\nparticle by particle, by silica in solution through the action of\r\nunderground waters, even the microscopic structures of the wood\r\nbeing perfectly reproduced. In shells originally made of\r\nARAGONITE, a crystalline form of carbonate of lime, that mineral\r\nis usually replaced by CALCITE, a more stable form of the same\r\nsubstance. The most common petrifying materials are calcite,\r\nsilica, and pyrite.\r\n\r\nOften the organic substance has neither been preserved nor\r\nreplaced, but the FORM has been retained by means of molds and\r\ncasts. Permanent impressions, or molds, may be made in sediments\r\nnot only by the hard parts of organisms, but also by such soft and\r\nperishable parts as the leaves of plants, and, in the rarest\r\ninstances, by the skin of animals and the feathers of birds. In\r\nfine-grained limestones even the imprints of jellyfish have been\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of molds and casts may be illustrated by means\r\nof a clam shell and some moist clay, the latter representing the\r\nsediments in which the remains of animals and plants are entombed.\r\nImbedding the shell in the clay and allowing the clay to harden,\r\nwe have a MOLD OF THE EXTERIOR of the shell, as is seen on cutting\r\nthe clay matrix in two and removing the shell from it. Filling\r\nthis mold with clay of different color, we obtain a CAST OF THE\r\nEXTERIOR, which represents accurately the original form and\r\nsurface markings of the shell. In nature, shells and other relics\r\nof animals or plants are often removed by being dissolved by\r\npercolating waters, and the molds are either filled with sediments\r\nor with minerals deposited from solution.\r\n\r\nWhere the fossil is hollow, a CAST OF THE INTERIOR is made in the\r\nsame way. Interior casts of shells reproduce any markings on the\r\ninside of the valves, and casts of the interior of the skulls of\r\nancient vertebrates show the form and size of their brains.\r\n\r\nIMPERFECTION OF THE LIFE RECORD. At the present time only the\r\nsmallest fraction of the life on earth ever gets entombed in rocks\r\nnow forming. In the forest great fallen tree trunks, as well as\r\ndead leaves, decay, and only add a little to the layer of dark\r\nvegetable mold from which they grew. The bones of land animals\r\nare, for the most part, left unburied on the surface and are soon\r\ndestroyed by chemical agencies. Even where, as in the swamps of\r\nriver, flood plains and in other bogs, there are preserved the\r\nremains of plants, and sometimes insects, together with the bones\r\nof some animal drowned or mired, in most cases these swamp and bog\r\ndeposits are sooner or later destroyed by the shifting channels of\r\nthe stream or by the general erosion of the land.\r\n\r\nIn the sea the conditions for preservation are more favorable than\r\non land; yet even here the proportion of animals and plants whose\r\nhard parts are fossilized is very small compared with those which\r\neither totally decay before they are buried in slowly accumulating\r\nsediments or are ground to powder by waves and currents.\r\n\r\nWe may infer that during each period of the past, as at the\r\npresent, only a very insignificant fraction of the innumerable\r\norganisms of sea and land escaped destruction and left in\r\ncontinental and oceanic deposits permanent records of their\r\nexistence. Scanty as these original life records must have been,\r\nthey have been largely destroyed by metamorphism of the rocks in\r\nwhich they were imbedded, by solution in underground waters, and\r\nby the vast denudation under which the sediments of earlier\r\nperiods have been eroded to furnish materials for the sedimentary\r\nrecords of later times. Moreover, very much of what has escaped\r\ndestruction still remains undiscovered. The immense bulk of the\r\nstratified rocks is buried and inaccessible, and the records of\r\nthe past which it contains can never be known. Comparatively few\r\noutcrops have been thoroughly searched for fossils. Although new\r\nspecies are constantly being discovered, each discovery may be\r\nconsidered as the outcome of a series of happy accidents,--that\r\nthe remains of individuals of this particular species happened to\r\nbe imbedded and fossilized, that they happened to escape\r\ndestruction during long ages, and that they happened to be exposed\r\nand found.\r\n\r\nSOME INFERENCES FROM THE RECORDS OF THE HISTORY OF LIFE UPON THE\r\nPLANET. Meager as are these records, they set forth plainly some\r\nimportant truths which we will now briefly mention.\r\n\r\n1. Each series of the stratified rocks, except the very deepest,\r\ncontains vestiges of life. Hence THE EARTH WAS TENANTED BY LIVING\r\nCREATURES FOR AN UNCALCULATED LENGTH OF TIME BEFORE HUMAN HISTORY\r\nBEGAN.\r\n\r\n2. LIFE ON THE EARTH HAS BEEN EVERCHANGING. The youngest strata\r\nhold the remains of existing species of animals and plants and\r\nthose of species and varieties closely allied to them. Strata\r\nsomewhat older contain fewer existing species, and in strata of a\r\nstill earlier, but by no means an ancient epoch, no existing\r\nspecies are to be found; the species of that epoch and of previous\r\nepochs have vanished from the living world. During all geological\r\ntime since life began on earth old species have constantly become\r\nextinct and with them the genera and families to which they\r\nbelong, and other species, genera, and families have replaced\r\nthem. The fossils of each formation differ on the whole from those\r\nof every other. The assemblage of animals and plants (the FAUNA-\r\nFLORA) of each epoch differs from that of every other epoch.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the extinction of a type has been gradual; in other\r\ninstances apparently abrupt. There is no evidence that any\r\norganism once become extinct has ever reappeared. The duration of\r\na species in time, or its \"vertical range\" through the strata,\r\nvaries greatly. Some species are limited to a stratum a few feet\r\nin thickness; some may range through an entire formation and be\r\nfound but little modified in still higher beds. A formation may\r\nthus often be divided into zones, each characterized by its own\r\npeculiar species. As a rule, the simpler organisms have a longer\r\nduration as species, though not as individuals, than the more\r\ncomplex.\r\n\r\n3. THE LARGER ZOOLOGICAL AND BOTANICAL GROUPINGS SURVIVE LONGER\r\nTHAN THE SMALLER. Species are so short-lived that a single\r\ngeological epoch may be marked by several more or less complete\r\nextinctions of the species of its fauna-flora and their\r\nreplacement by other species. A genus continues with new species\r\nafter all the species with which it began have become extinct.\r\nFamilies survive genera, and orders families. Classes are so long-\r\nlived that most of those which are known from the earliest\r\nformations are represented by living forms, and no sub-kingdom has\r\never become extinct.\r\n\r\nThus, to take an example from the stony corals,--the ZOANTHARIA,--\r\nthe particular characters--which constituted a certain SPECIES--\r\nFacosites niagarensis--of the order are confined to the Niagara\r\nseries. Its GENERIC characters appeared in other species earlier\r\nin the Silurian and continued through the Devonian. Its FAMILY\r\ncharacters, represented in different genera and species, range\r\nfrom the Ordovician to the close of the Paleozoic; while the\r\ncharacters which it shares with all its order, the Zoantharia,\r\nbegan in the Cambrian and are found in living species.\r\n\r\n4. THE CHANGE IN ORGANISMS HAS BEEN GRADUAL. The fossils of each\r\nlife zone and of each formation of a conformable series closely\r\nresemble, with some explainable exceptions, those of the beds\r\nimmediately above and below. The animals and plants which tenanted\r\nthe earth during any geological epoch are so closely related to\r\nthose of the preceding and the succeeding epochs that we may\r\nconsider them to be the descendants of the one and the ancestors\r\nof the other, thus accounting for the resemblance by heredity. It\r\nis therefore believed that the species of animals and plants now\r\nliving on the earth are the descendants of the species whose\r\nremains we find entombed in the rocks, and that the chain of life\r\nhas been unbroken since its beginning.\r\n\r\n5. THE CHANGE IN SPECIES HAS BEEN A GRADUAL DIFFERENTIATION.\r\nTracing the lines of descent of various animals and plants of the\r\npresent backward through the divisions of geologic time, we find\r\nthat these lines of descent converge and unite in simpler and\r\nstill simpler types. The development of life may be represented by\r\na tree whose trunk is found in the earliest ages and whose\r\nbranches spread and subdivide to the growing twigs of present\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n6. THE CHANGE IN ORGANISMS THROUGHOUT GEOLOGIC TIME HAS BEEN A\r\nPROGRESSIVE CHANGE. In the earliest ages the only animals and\r\nplants on the earth were lowly forms, simple and generalized in\r\nstructure; while succeeding ages have been characterized by the\r\nintroduction of types more and more specialized and complex, and\r\ntherefore of higher rank in the scale of being. Thus the Algonkian\r\ncontains the remains of only the humblest forms of the\r\ninvertebrates. In the Cambrian, Ordovician, and Silurian the\r\ninvertebrates were represented in all their subkingdoms by a\r\nvaried fauna. In the Devonian, fishes--the lowest of the\r\nvertebrates--became abundant. Amphibians made their entry on the\r\nstage in the Carboniferous, and reptiles came to rule the world in\r\nthe Mesozoic. Mammals culminated in the Tertiary in strange forms\r\nwhich became more and more like those of the present as the long\r\nages of that era rolled on; and latest of all appeared the noblest\r\nproduct of the creative process, man.\r\n\r\nJust as growth is characteristic of the individual life, so\r\ngradual, progressive change, or evolution, has characterized the\r\nhistory of life upon the planet. The evolution of the organic\r\nkingdom from its primitive germinal forms to the complex and\r\nhighly organized fauna-flora of to-day may be compared to the\r\ngrowth of some noble oak as it rises from the acorn, spreading\r\nloftier and more widely extended branches as it grows.\r\n\r\n7. While higher and still higher types have continually been\r\nevolved, until man, the highest of all, appeared, THE LOWER AND\r\nEARLIER TYPES HAVE GENERALLY PERSISTED. Some which reached their\r\nculmination early in the history of the earth have since changed\r\nonly in slight adjustments to a changing environment. Thus the\r\nbrachiopods, a type of shellfish, have made no progress since the\r\nPaleozoic, and some of their earliest known genera are represented\r\nby living forms hardly to be distinguished from their ancient\r\nancestors. The lowest and earliest branches of the tree of life\r\nhave risen to no higher levels since they reached their climax of\r\ndevelopment long ago.\r\n\r\n8. A strange parallel has been found to exist between the\r\nevolution of organisms and the development of the individual. In\r\nthe embryonic stages of its growth the individual passes swiftly\r\nthrough the successive stages through which its ancestors evolved\r\nduring the millions of years of geologic time. THE DEVELOPMENT OF\r\nTHE INDIVIDUAL RECAPITULATES THE EVOLUTION OF THE RACE.\r\n\r\nThe frog is a typical amphibian. As a tadpole it passes through a\r\nstage identical in several well-known features with the maturity\r\nof fishes; as, for example, its aquatic life, the tail by which it\r\nswims, and the gills through which it breathes. It is a fair\r\ninference that the tadpole stage in the life history of the frog\r\nrepresents a stage in the evolution of its kind,--that the\r\nAmphibia are derived from fishlike ancestral forms. This inference\r\nis amply confirmed in the geological record; fishes appeared\r\nbefore Amphibia and were connected with them by transitional\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT LENGTH OF GEOLOGIC TIME INFERRED FROM THE SLOW CHANGE OF\r\nSPECIES. Life forms, like land forms, are thus subject to change\r\nunder the influence of their changing environment and of forces\r\nacting from within. How slowly they change may be seen in the\r\napparent stability of existing species. In the lifetime of the\r\nobserver and even in the recorded history of man, species seem as\r\nstable as the mountain and the river. But life forms and land\r\nforms are alike variable, both in nature and still more under the\r\nshaping hand of man. As man has modified the face of the earth\r\nwith his great engineering works, so he has produced widely\r\ndifferent varieties of many kinds of domesticated plants and\r\nanimals, such as the varieties of the dog and the horse, the apple\r\nand the rose, which may be regarded in some respects as new\r\nspecies in the making. We have assumed that land forms have\r\nchanged in the past under the influence of forces now in\r\noperation. Assuming also that life forms have always changed as\r\nthey are changing at present, we come to realize something of the\r\nimmensity of geologic time required for the evolution of life from\r\nits earliest lowly forms up to man.\r\n\r\nIt is because the onward march of life has taken the same general\r\ncourse the world over that we are able to use it as a UNIVERSAL\r\nTIME SCALE and divide geologic time into ages and minor\r\nsubdivisions according to the ruling or characteristic organisms\r\nthen living on the earth. Thus, since vertebrates appeared, we\r\nhave in succession the Age of Fishes, the Age of Amphibians, the\r\nAge of Reptiles, and the Age of Mammals.\r\n\r\nThe chart given on page 295 is thus based on the law of\r\nsuperposition and the law of the evolution of organisms. The first\r\nlaw gives the succession of the formations in local areas. The\r\nfossils which they contain demonstrate the law of the progressive\r\nappearance of organisms, and by means of this law the formations\r\nof different countries are correlated and set each in its place in\r\na universal time scale and grouped together according to the\r\naffinities of their imbedded organic remains.\r\n\r\nGEOLOGIC TIME DIVISIONS COMPARED WITH THOSE OF HUMAN HISTORY. We\r\nmay compare the division of geologic time into eras, periods, and\r\nother divisions according to the dominant life of the time, to the\r\nill-defined ages into which human history is divided according to\r\nthe dominance of some nation, ruler, or other characteristic\r\nfeature. Thus we speak of the DARK AGES, the AGE OF ELIZABETH, and\r\nthe AGE OF ELECTRICITY. These crude divisions would be of much\r\nvalue if, as in the case of geologic time, we had no exact\r\nreckoning of human history by years.\r\n\r\nAnd as the course of human history has flowed in an unbroken\r\nstream along quiet reaches of slow change and through periods of\r\nrapid change and revolution, so with the course of geologic\r\nhistory. Periods of quiescence, in which revolutionary forces are\r\nperhaps gathering head, alternate with periods of comparatively\r\nrapid change in physical geography and in organisms, when new and\r\nhigher forms appear which serve to draw the boundary line of new\r\nepochs. Nevertheless, geological history is a continuous progress;\r\nits periods and epochs shade into one another by imperceptible\r\ngradations, and all our subdivisions must needs be vague and more\r\nor less arbitrary.\r\n\r\nHOW FOSSILS TELL OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE PAST. Fossils are used\r\nnot only as a record of the development of life upon the earth,\r\nbut also in testimony to the physical geography of past epochs.\r\nThey indicate whether in any region the climate was tropical,\r\ntemperate, or arctic. Since species spread slowly from some center\r\nof dispersion where they originate until some barrier limits their\r\nmigration farther, the occurrence of the same species in rocks of\r\nthe same system in different countries implies the absence of such\r\nbarriers at the period. Thus in the collection of antarctic\r\nfossils referred to on page 294 there were shallow-water marine\r\nshells identical in species with Mesozoic shells found in India\r\nand in the southern extremity of South America. Since such\r\norganisms are not distributed by the currents of the deep sea and\r\ncannot migrate along its bottom, we infer a shallow-water\r\nconnection in Mesozoic times between India, South America, and the\r\nantarctic region. Such a shallow-water connection would be offered\r\nalong the marginal shelf of a continent uniting these now widely\r\nseparated countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE PRE-CAMBRIAN SYSTEMS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH'S BEGINNINGS. The geological record does not tell us of\r\nthe beginnings of the earth. The history of the planet, as we have\r\nevery reason to believe, stretches far back beyond the period of\r\nthe oldest stratified rocks, and is involved in the history of the\r\nsolar system and of the nebula,--the cloud of glowing gases or of\r\ncosmic dust,--from which the sun and planets are believed to have\r\nbeen derived.\r\n\r\nTHE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS. It is possible that the earth began as a\r\nvaporous, shining sphere, formed by the gathering together of the\r\nmaterial of a gaseous ring which had been detached from a cooling\r\nand shrinking nebula. Such a vaporous sphere would condense to a\r\nliquid, fiery globe, whose surface would become cold and solid,\r\nwhile the interior would long remain intensely hot because of the\r\nslow conductivity of the crust. Under these conditions the\r\nprimeval atmosphere of the earth must have contained in vapor the\r\nwater now belonging to the earth's crust and surface. It held also\r\nall the oxygen since locked up in rocks by their oxidation, and\r\nall the carbon dioxide which has since been laid away in\r\nlimestones, besides that corresponding to the carbon of\r\ncarbonaceous deposits, such as peat, coal, and petroleum. On this\r\nhypothesis the original atmosphere was dense, dark, and noxious,\r\nand enormously heavier than the atmosphere at present.\r\n\r\nTHE ACCRETION HYPOTHESIS. On the other hand, it has been recently\r\nsuggested that the earth may have grown to its present size by the\r\ngradual accretion of meteoritic masses. Such cold, stony bodies\r\nmight have come together at so slow a rate that the heat caused by\r\ntheir impact would not raise sensibly the temperature of the\r\ngrowing planet. Thus the surface of the earth may never have been\r\nhot and luminous; but as the loose aggregation of stony masses\r\ngrew larger and was more and more compressed by its own\r\ngravitation, the heat thus generated raised the interior to high\r\ntemperatures, while from time to time molten rock was intruded\r\namong the loose, cold meteoritic masses of the crust and outpoured\r\nupon the surface.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that the meteorites of which the earth was built\r\nbrought to it, as meteorites do now, various gases shut up within\r\ntheir pores. As the heat of the interior increased, these gases\r\ntranspired to the surface and formed the primitive atmosphere and\r\nhydrosphere. The atmosphere has therefore grown slowly from the\r\nsmallest beginnings. Gases emitted from the interior in volcanic\r\neruptions and in other ways have ever added to it, and are adding\r\nto it now. On the other hand, the atmosphere has constantly\r\nsuffered loss, as it has been robbed of oxygen by the oxidation of\r\nrocks in weathering, and of carbon dioxide in the making of\r\nlimestones and carbonaceous deposits.\r\n\r\nWhile all hypotheses of the earth's beginnings are as yet unproved\r\nspeculations, they serve to bring to mind one of the chief lessons\r\nwhich geology has to teach,--that the duration of the earth in\r\ntime, like the extension of the universe in space, is vastly\r\nbeyond the power of the human mind to realize. Behind the history\r\nrecorded in the rocks, which stretches back for many million\r\nyears, lies the long unrecorded history of the beginnings of the\r\nplanet; and still farther in the abysses of the past are dimly\r\nseen the cycles of the evolution of the solar system and of the\r\nnebula which gave it birth.\r\n\r\nWe pass now from the dim realm of speculation to the earliest era\r\nof the recorded history of the earth, where some certain facts may\r\nbe observed and some sure inferences from them may be drawn.\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHEAN.\r\n\r\nThe oldest known sedimentary strata, wherever they are exposed by\r\nuplift and erosion, are found to be involved with a mass of\r\ncrystalline rocks which possesses the same characteristics in all\r\nparts of the world. It consists of foliated rocks, gneisses, and\r\nschists of various kinds, which have been cut with dikes and other\r\nintrusions of molten rock, and have been broken, crumpled, and\r\ncrushed, and left in interlocking masses so confused that their\r\ntrue arrangement can usually be made out only with the greatest\r\ndifficulty if at all. The condition of this body of crystalline\r\nrocks is due to the fact that they have suffered not only from the\r\nfaultings, foldings, and igneous intrusions of their time, but\r\nnecessarily, also, from those of all later geological ages.\r\n\r\nAt present three leading theories are held as to the origin of\r\nthese basal crystalline rocks.\r\n\r\n1. They are considered by perhaps the majority of the geologists\r\nwho have studied them most carefully to be igneous rocks intruded\r\nin a molten state among the sedimentary rocks involved with them.\r\nIn many localities this relation is proved by the phenomena of\r\ncontact; but for the most part the deformations which the rocks\r\nhave since suffered again and again have been sufficient to\r\ndestroy such evidence if it ever existed.\r\n\r\n2. An older view regards them as profoundly altered sedimentary\r\nstrata, the most ancient of the earth.\r\n\r\n3. According to a third theory they represent portions of the\r\nearth's original crust; not, indeed, its original surface, but\r\ndeeper portions uncovered by erosion and afterwards mantled with\r\nsedimentary deposits. All these theories agree that the present\r\nfoliated condition of these rocks is due to the intense\r\nmetamorphism which they have suffered.\r\n\r\nIt is to this body of crystalline rocks and the stratified rocks\r\ninvolved with it, which form a very small proportion of its mass,\r\nthat the term ARCHEAN (Greek, ARCHE, beginning) is applied by many\r\ngeologists.\r\n\r\nTHE ALGONKIAN\r\n\r\nIn some regions there rests unconformably on the Archean an\r\nimmense body of stratified rocks, thousands and in places even\r\nscores of thousands of feet thick, known as the ALGONKIAN. Great\r\nunconformities divide it into well-defined systems, but as only\r\nthe scantiest traces of fossils appear here and there among its\r\nstrata, it is as yet impossible to correlate the formations of\r\ndifferent regions and to give them names of more than local\r\napplication. We will describe the Algonkian rocks of two typical\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND CANYON OF THE COLORADO. We have already studied a very\r\nancient peneplain whose edge is exposed to view deep on the walls\r\nof the Colorado Canyon. The formation of flat-lying sandstone\r\nwhich covers this buried land surface is proved by its fossils to\r\nbelong to the Cambrian,--the earliest period of the Paleozoic era.\r\nThe tilted rocks on whose upturned edges the Cambrian sandstone\r\nrests are far older, for the physical break which separates them\r\nfrom it records a time interval during which they were upheaved to\r\nmountainous ridges and worn down to a low plain. They are\r\ntherefore classified as Algonkian. They comprise two immense\r\nseries. The upper is more than five thousand feet thick and\r\nconsists of shales and sandstones with some limestones. Separated\r\nfrom it by an unconformity which does not appear in Figure 207,\r\nthe lower division, seven thousand feet thick, consists chiefly of\r\nmassive reddish sandstones with seven or more sheets of lava\r\ninterbedded. The lowest member is a basal conglomerate composed of\r\npebbles derived from the erosion of the dark crumpled schists\r\nbeneath,--schists which are supposed to be Archean. As shown in\r\nFigure 207, a strong unconformity parts the schists and the\r\nAlgonkian. The floor on which the Algonkian rests is remarkably\r\neven, and here again is proved an interval of incalculable length,\r\nduring which an ancient land mass of Archean rocks was baseleveled\r\nbefore it received the cover of the sediments of the later age.\r\n\r\nTHE LAKE SUPERIOR REGION. In eastern Canada an area of pre-\r\nCambrian rocks, Archean and Algonkian, estimated at two million\r\nsquare miles, stretches from the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence\r\nRiver northward to the confines of the continent, inclosing Hudson\r\nBay in the arms of a gigantic U. This immense area, which we have\r\nalready studied as the Laurentian peneplain, extends southward\r\nacross the Canadian border into northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and\r\nMichigan. The rocks of this area are known to be pre-Cambrian; for\r\nthe Cambrian strata, wherever found, lie unconformably upon them.\r\n\r\nThe general relations of the formations of that portion of the\r\narea which lies about Lake Superior are shown in Figure 262. Great\r\nunconformities, UU' separate the Algonkian both from the Archean\r\nand from the Cambrian, and divide it into three distinct systems,\r\n--the LOWER HURONIAN, the UPPER HURONIAN, and the KEWEENAWAN. The\r\nLower and the Upper Huronian consist in the main of old sea muds\r\nand sands and limy oozes now changed to gneisses, schists,\r\nmarbles, quartzites, slates, and other metamorphic rocks. The\r\nKeweenawan is composed of immense piles of lava, such as those of\r\nIceland, overlain by bedded sandstones. What remains of these rock\r\nsystems after the denudation of all later geologic ages is\r\nenormous. The Lower Huronian is more than a mile thick, the Upper\r\nHuronian more than two miles thick, while the Keweenawan exceeds\r\nnine miles in thickness. The vast length of Algonkian time is\r\nshown by the thickness of its marine deposits and by the cycles of\r\nerosion which it includes. In Figure 262 the student may read an\r\noutline of the history of the Lake Superior region, the\r\ndeformations which it suffered, their relative severity, the times\r\nwhen they occurred, and the erosion cycles marked by the\r\nsuccessive unconformities.\r\n\r\nOTHER PRE-CAMBRIAN AREAS IN NORTH AMERICA. Pre-Cambrian rocks are\r\nexposed in various parts of the continent, usually by the erosion\r\nof mountain ranges in which their strata were infolded. Large\r\nareas occur in the maritime provinces of Canada. The core of the\r\nGreen Mountains of Vermont is pre-Cambrian, and rocks of these\r\nsystems occur in scattered patches in western Massachusetts. Here\r\nbelong also the oldest rocks of the Highlands of the Hudson and of\r\nNew Jersey. The Adirondack region, an outlier of the Laurentian\r\nregion, exposes pre-Cambrian rocks, which have been metamorphosed\r\nand tilted by the intrusion of a great boss of igneous rock out of\r\nwhich the central peaks are carved. The core of the Blue Ridge and\r\nprobably much of the Piedmont Belt are of this age. In the Black\r\nHills the irruption of an immense mass of granite has caused or\r\naccompanied the upheaval of pre-Cambrian strata and metamorphosed\r\nthem by heat and pressure into gneisses, schists, quartzites, and\r\nslates. In most of these mountainous regions the lowest strata are\r\nprofoundly changed by metamorphism, and they can be assigned to\r\nthe pre-Cambrian only where they are clearly overlain\r\nunconformably by formations proved to be Cambrian by their\r\nfossils. In the Belt Mountains of Montana, however, the Cambrian\r\nis underlain by Algonkian sediments twelve thousand feet thick,\r\nand but little altered.\r\n\r\nMINERAL WEALTH OF THE PRE-CAMBRIAN ROCKS. The pre-Cambrian rocks\r\nare of very great economic importance, because of their extensive\r\nmetamorphism and the enormous masses of igneous rock which they\r\ninvolve. In many parts of the country they are the source of\r\nsupply of granite, gneiss, marble, slate, and other such building\r\nmaterials. Still more valuable are the stores of iron and copper\r\nand other metals which they contain.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the pre-Cambrian region about Lake Superior\r\nleads the world in the production of iron ore, its output for 1903\r\nbeing more than five sevenths of the entire output of the whole\r\nUnited States, and exceeding that of any foreign country. The ore\r\nbodies consist chiefly of the red oxide of iron (hematite) and\r\noccur in troughs of the strata, underlain by some impervious rock.\r\nA theory held by many refers the ultimate source of the iron to\r\nthe igneous rocks of the Archean. When these rocks were upheaved\r\nand subjected to weathering, their iron compounds were decomposed.\r\nTheir iron was leached out and carried away to be laid in the\r\nAlgonkian water bodies in beds of iron carbonate and other iron\r\ncompounds. During the later ages, after the Algonkian strata had\r\nbeen uplifted to form part of the continent, a second\r\nconcentration has taken place. Descending underground waters\r\ncharged with oxygen have decomposed the iron carbonate and\r\ndeposited the iron, in the form of iron oxide, in troughs of the\r\nstrata where their downward progress was arrested by impervious\r\nfloors.\r\n\r\nThe pre-Cambrian rocks of the eastern United States also are rich\r\nin iron. In certain districts, as in the Highlands of New Jersey,\r\nthe black oxide of iron (magnetite) is so abundant in beds and\r\ndisseminated grains that the ordinary surveyor's compass is\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nThe pre-Cambrian copper mines of the Lake Superior region are\r\namong the richest on the globe. In the igneous rocks copper, next\r\nto iron, is the most common of all the useful metals, and it was\r\nespecially abundant in the Keweenawan lavas. After the Keweenawan\r\nwas uplifted to form land, percolating waters leached out much of\r\nthe copper diffused in the lava sheets and deposited it within\r\nsteam blebs as amygdules of native copper, in cracks and fissures,\r\nand especially as a cement, or matrix, in the interbedded gravels\r\nwhich formed the chief aquifers of the region. The famous Calumet\r\nand Hecla mine follows down the dip of the strata to the depth of\r\nnearly a mile and works such an ancient conglomerate whose matrix\r\nis pure copper.\r\n\r\nTHE APPEARANCE OF LIFE. Sometime during the dim ages preceding the\r\nCambrian, whether in the Archean or in the Algonkian we know not,\r\noccurred one of the most important events in the history of the\r\nearth. Life appeared for the first time upon the planet. Geology\r\nhas no evidence whatever to offer as to whence or how life came.\r\nAll analogies lead us to believe that its appearance must have\r\nbeen sudden. Its earliest forms are unknown, but analogy suggests\r\nthat as every living creature has developed from a single cell, so\r\nthe earliest organisms upon the globe--the germs from which all\r\nlater life is supposed to have been evolved--were tiny,\r\nunicellular masses of protoplasm, resembling the amoeba of to-day\r\nin the simplicity of their structure.\r\n\r\nSuch lowly forms were destitute of any hard parts and could leave\r\nno evidence of their existence in the record of the rocks. And of\r\ntheir supposed descendants we find so few traces in the pre-\r\nCambrian strata that the first steps in organic evolution must be\r\nsupplied from such analogies in embryology as the following. The\r\nfertilized ovum, the cell with which each animal begins its life,\r\ngrows and multiplies by cell division, and develops into a hollow\r\nglobe of cells called the BLASTOSPHERE. This stage is succeeded by\r\nthe stage of the GASTRULA,--an ovoid or cup-shaped body with a\r\ndouble wall of cells inclosing a body cavity, and with an opening,\r\nthe primitive mouth. Each of these early embryological stages is\r\nrepresented by living animals,--the undivided cell by the\r\nPROTOZOA, the blastosphere by some rare forms, and the gastrula in\r\nthe essential structure of the COELENTERATES,--the subkingdom to\r\nwhich the fresh-water hydra and the corals belong. All forms of\r\nanimal life, from the coelenterates to the mammals, follow the\r\nsame path in their embryological development as far as the\r\ngastrula stage, but here their paths widely diverge, those of each\r\nsubkingdom going their own separate ways.\r\n\r\nWe may infer, therefore, that during the pre-Cambrian periods\r\norganic evolution followed the lines thus dimly traced. The\r\nearliest one-celled protozoa were probably succeeded by many-\r\ncelled animals of the type of the blastosphere, and these by\r\ngastrula-like organisms. From the gastrula type the higher sub-\r\ndivisions of animal life probably diverged, as separate branches\r\nfrom a common trunk. Much or all of this vast differentiation was\r\naccomplished before the opening of the next era; for all the\r\nsubkingdoms are represented in the Cambrian except the\r\nvertebrates.\r\n\r\nEVIDENCES OF PRE-CAMBRIAN LIFE. An indirect evidence of life\r\nduring the pre-Cambrian periods is found in the abundant and\r\nvaried fauna of the next period; for, if the theory of evolution\r\nis correct, the differentiation of the Cambrian fauna was a long\r\nprocess which might well have required for its accomplishment a\r\nlarge part of pre-Cambrian time.\r\n\r\nOther indirect evidences are the pre-Cambrian limestones, iron\r\nores, and graphite deposits, since such minerals and rocks have\r\nbeen formed in later times by the help of organisms. If the\r\ncarbonate of lime of the Algonkian limestones and marbles was\r\nextracted from sea water by organisms, as is done at present by\r\ncorals, mollusks, and other humble animals and plants, the life of\r\nthose ancient seas must have been abundant. Graphite, a soft black\r\nmineral composed of carbon and used in the manufacture of lead\r\npencils and as a lubricant, occurs widely in the metamorphic pre-\r\nCambrian rocks. It is known to be produced in some cases by the\r\nmetamorphism of coal, which itself is formed of decomposed vegetal\r\ntissues. Seams of graphite may therefore represent accumulations\r\nof vegetal matter such as seaweed. But limestone, iron ores, and\r\ngraphite can be produced by chemical processes, and their presence\r\nin the pre-Cambrian makes it only probable, and not certain, that\r\nlife existed at that time.\r\n\r\nPRE-CAMBRIAN FOSSILS. Very rarely has any clear trace of an\r\norganism been found in the most ancient chapters of the geological\r\nrecord, so many of their leaves have been destroyed and so far\r\nhave their pages been defaced. Omitting structures whose organic\r\nnature has been questioned, there are left to mention a tiny\r\nseashell of one of the most lowly types,--a DISCINA from the pre-\r\nCambrian rocks of the Colorado Canyon,--and from the pre-Cambrian\r\nrocks of Montana trails of annelid worms and casts of their\r\nburrows in ancient beaches, and fragments of the tests of\r\ncrustaceans. These diverse forms indicate that before the\r\nAlgonkian had closed, life was abundant and had widely\r\ndifferentiated. We may expect that other forms will be discovered\r\nas the rocks are closely searched.\r\n\r\nPRE-CAMBRIAN GEOGRAPHY. Our knowledge is far too meager to warrant\r\nan attempt to draw the varying outlines of sea and land during the\r\nArchean and Algonkian eras. Pre-Cambrian time probably was longer\r\nthan all later geological time down to the present, as we may\r\ninfer from the vast thicknesses of its rocks and the\r\nunconformities which part them. We know that during its long\r\nperiods land masses again and again rose from the sea, were worn\r\nlow, and were submerged and covered with the waste of other lands.\r\nBut the formations of separated regions cannot be correlated\r\nbecause of the absence of fossils, and nothing more can be made\r\nout than the detached chapters of local histories, such as the\r\noutline given of the district about Lake Superior.\r\n\r\nThe pre-Cambrian rocks show no evidence of any forces then at work\r\nupon the earth except the forces which are at work upon it now.\r\nThe most ancient sediments known are so like the sediments now\r\nbeing laid that we may infer that they were formed under\r\nconditions essentially similar to those of the present time. There\r\nis no proof that the sands of the pre-Cambrian sandstones were\r\nswept by any more powerful waves and currents than are offshore\r\nsands to-day, or that the muds of the pre-Cambrian shales settled\r\nto the sea floor in less quiet water than such muds settle in at\r\npresent. The pre-Cambrian lands were, no doubt, worn by wind and\r\nweather, beaten by rain, and furrowed by streams as now, and, as\r\nnow, they fronted the ocean with beaches on which waves dashed and\r\nalong which tidal currents ran.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the chief difference between the pre-Cambrian and the\r\npresent was the absence of life upon the land. So far as we have\r\nany knowledge, no forests covered the mountain sides, no verdure\r\ncarpeted the plains, and no animals lived on the ground or in the\r\nair. It is permitted to think of the most ancient lands as deserts\r\nof barren rock and rock waste swept by rains and trenched by\r\npowerful streams. We may therefore suppose that the processes of\r\ntheir destruction went on more rapidly than at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE CAMBRIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PALEOZOIC ERA. The second volume of the geological record,\r\ncalled the Paleozoic (Greek, PALAIOS, ancient; ZOE, life), has\r\ncome down to us far less mutilated and defaced than has the first\r\nvolume, which contains the traces of the most ancient life of the\r\nglobe. Fossils are far more abundant in the Paleozoic than in the\r\nearlier strata, while the sediments in which they were entombed\r\nhave suffered far less from metamorphism and other causes, and\r\nhave been less widely buried from view, than the strata of the\r\npre-Cambrian groups. By means of their fossils we can correlate\r\nthe formations of widely separated regions from the beginning of\r\nthe Paleozoic on, and can therefore trace some outline of the\r\nhistory of the continents.\r\n\r\nPaleozoic time, although shorter than the pre-Cambrian as measured\r\nby the thickness of the strata, must still be reckoned in millions\r\nof years. During this vast reach of time the changes in organisms\r\nwere very great. It is according to the successive stages in the\r\nadvance of life that the Paleozoic formations are arranged in five\r\nsystems,--the CAMBRIAN, the ORDOVICIAN, the SILURIAN, the\r\nDEVONIAN, and the CARBONIFEROUS. On the same basis the first three\r\nsystems are grouped together as the older Paleozoic, because they\r\nalike are characterized by the dominance of the invertebrates;\r\nwhile the last two systems are united in the later Paleozoic, and\r\nare characterized, the one by the dominance of fishes, and the\r\nother by the appearance of amphibians and reptiles.\r\n\r\nEach of these systems is world-wide in its distribution, and may\r\nbe recognized on any continent by its own peculiar fauna. The\r\nnames first given them in Great Britain have therefore come into\r\ngeneral use, while their subdivisions, which often cannot be\r\ncorrelated in different countries and different regions, are\r\nusually given local names.\r\n\r\nThe first three systems were named from the fact that their strata\r\nare well displayed in Wales. The Cambrian carries the Roman name\r\nof Wales, and the Ordovician and Silurian the names of tribes of\r\nancient Britons which inhabited the same country. The Devonian is\r\nnamed from the English county Devon, where its rocks were early\r\nstudied. The Carboniferous was so called from the large amount of\r\ncoal which it was found to contain in Great Britain and\r\ncontinental Europe.\r\n\r\nTHE CAMBRIAN\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF STRATA. The Cambrian rocks outcrop in narrow belts\r\nabout the pre-Cambrian areas of eastern Canada and the Lake\r\nSuperior region, the Adirondacks and the Green Mountains. Strips\r\nof Cambrian formations occupy troughs in the pre-Cambrian rocks of\r\nNew England and the maritime provinces of Canada; a long belt\r\nborders on the west the crystalline rocks of the Blue Ridge; and\r\non the opposite side of the continent the Cambrian reappears in\r\nthe mountains of the Great Basin and the Canadian Rockies. In the\r\nMississippi valley it is exposed in small districts where uplift\r\nhas permitted the stripping off of younger rocks. Although the\r\nareas of outcrop are small, we may infer that Cambrian rocks were\r\nwidely deposited over the continent of North America.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. The Cambrian system of North America comprises\r\nthree distinct series, the LOWER CAMBRIAN, the MIDDLE CAMBRIAN,\r\nand the UPPER CAMBRIAN, each of which is characterized by its own\r\npeculiar fauna. In sketching the outlines of the continent as it\r\nwas at the beginning of the Paleozoic, it must be remembered that\r\nwherever the Lower Cambrian formations now are found was certainly\r\nthen sea bottom, and wherever the Lower Cambrian are wanting, and\r\nthe next formations rest directly on pre-Cambrian rocks, was\r\nprobably then land.\r\n\r\nEARLY CAMBRIAN GEOGRAPHY. In this way we know that at the opening\r\nof the Cambrian two long, narrow mediterranean seas stretched from\r\nnorth to south across the continent. The eastern sea extended from\r\nthe Gulf of St. Lawrence down the Champlain-Hudson valley and\r\nthence along the western base of the Blue Ridge south at least to\r\nAlabama. The western sea stretched from the Canadian Rockies over\r\nthe Great Basin and at least as far south as the Grand Canyon of\r\nthe Colorado in Arizona.\r\n\r\nBetween these mediterraneans lay a great central land which\r\nincluded the pre-Cambrian U-shaped area of the Laurentian\r\npeneplain, and probably extended southward to the latitude of New\r\nOrleans. To the east lay a land which we may designate as\r\nAPPALACHIA, whose western shore line was drawn along the site of\r\nthe present Blue Ridge, but whose other limits are quite unknown.\r\nThe land of Appalachia must have been large, for it furnished a\r\ngreat amount of waste during the entire Paleozoic era, and its\r\neastern coast may possibly have lain even beyond the edge of the\r\npresent continental shelf. On the western side of the continent a\r\nnarrow land occupied the site of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.\r\n\r\nThus, even at the beginning of the Paleozoic, the continental\r\nplateau of North America had already been left by crustal\r\nmovements in relief above the abysses of the great oceans on\r\neither side. The mediterraneans which lay upon it were shallow, as\r\ntheir sediments prove. They were EPICONTINENTAL SEAS; that is,\r\nthey rested UPON (Greek, EPI) the submerged portion of the\r\ncontinental plateau. We have no proof that the deep ocean ever\r\noccupied any part of where North America now is.\r\n\r\nThe Middle and Upper Cambrian strata are found together with the\r\nLower Cambrian over the area of both the eastern and the western\r\nmediterraneans, so that here the sea continued during the entire\r\nperiod. The sediments throughout are those of shoal water. Coarse\r\ncross-bedded sandstones record the action of strong shifting\r\ncurrents which spread coarse waste near shore and winnowed it of\r\nfiner stuff. Frequent ripple marks on the bedding planes of the\r\nstrata prove that the loose sands of the sea floor were near\r\nenough to the surface to be agitated by waves and tidal currents.\r\nSun cracks show that often the outgoing tide exposed large muddy\r\nflats to the drying action of the sun. The fossils, also, of the\r\nstrata are of kinds related to those which now live in shallow\r\nwaters near the shore.\r\n\r\nThe sediments which gathered in the mediterranean seas were very\r\nthick, reaching in places the enormous depth of ten thousand feet.\r\nHence the bottoms of these seas were sinking troughs, ever filling\r\nwith waste from the adjacent land as fast as they subsided.\r\n\r\nLATE CAMBRIAN GEOGRAPHY. The formations of the Middle and Upper\r\nCambrian are found resting unconformably on the pre-Cambrian rocks\r\nfrom New York westward into Minnesota and at various points in the\r\ninterior, as in Missouri and in Texas. Hence after earlier\r\nCambrian time the central land subsided, with much the same effect\r\nas if the Mississippi valley were now to lower gradually, and the\r\nGulf of Mexico to spread northward until it entered Lake Superior.\r\nThe Cambrian seas transgressed the central land and strewed far\r\nand wide behind their advancing beaches the sediments of the later\r\nCambrian upon an eroded surface of pre-Cambrian rocks.\r\n\r\nThe succession of the Cambrian formations in North America records\r\nmany minor oscillations and varying conditions of physical\r\ngeography; yet on the whole it tells of widening seas and lowering\r\nlands. Basal conglomerates and coarse sandstones which must have\r\nbeen laid near shore are succeeded by shaly sandstones, sandy\r\nshales, and shales. Toward the top of the series heavy beds of\r\nlimestone, extending from the Blue Ridge to Missouri, speak of\r\nclear water, and either of more distant shores or of neighboring\r\nlands which were worn or sunk so low that for the most part their\r\nwaste was carried to the sea in solution.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the Cambrian was a period of submergence. It began with\r\nthe larger part of North America emerged as great land masses. It\r\nclosed with most of the interior of the continental plateau\r\ncovered with a shallow sea.\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD\r\n\r\nIt is now for the first time that we find preserved in the\r\noffshore deposits of the Cambrian seas enough remains of animal\r\nlife to be properly called a fauna. Doubtless these remains are\r\nonly the most fragmentary representation of the life of the time,\r\nfor the Cambrian rocks are very old and have been widely\r\nmetamorphosed. Yet the five hundred and more species already\r\ndiscovered embrace all the leading types of invertebrate life, and\r\nare so varied that we must believe that their lines of descent\r\nstretch far back into the pre-Cambrian past.\r\n\r\nPLANTS. No remains of plants have been found in Cambrian strata,\r\nexcept some doubtful markings, as of seaweed.\r\n\r\nSPONGES. The sponges, the lowest of the multicellular animals,\r\nwere represented by several orders. Their fossils are recognized\r\nby the siliceous spicules, which, as in modern sponges, either\r\nwere scattered through a mass of horny fibers or were connected in\r\na flinty framework.\r\n\r\nCOELENTERATES. This subkingdom includes two classes of interest to\r\nthe geologist,--the HYDROZOA, such as the fresh-water hydra and\r\nthe jellyfish, and the CORALS. Both classes existed in the\r\nCambrian.\r\n\r\nThe Hydrozoa were represented not only by jellyfish but also by\r\nthe GRAPTOLITE, which takes its name from a fancied resemblance of\r\nsome of its forms to a quill pen. It was a composite animal with a\r\nhorny framework, the individuals of the colony living in cells\r\nstrung on one or both sides along a hollow stem, and communicating\r\nby means of a common flesh in this central tube. Some graptolites\r\nwere straight, and some curved or spiral; some were single\r\nstemmed, and others consisted of several radial stems united.\r\nGraptolites occur but rarely in the Upper Cambrian. In the\r\nOrdovician and Silurian they are very plentiful, and at the close\r\nof the Silurian they pass out of existence, never to return.\r\n\r\nCORALS are very rarely found in the Cambrian, and the description\r\nof their primitive types is postponed to later chapters treating\r\nof periods when they became more numerous.\r\n\r\nECHINODERMS. This subkingdom comprises at present such familiar\r\nforms as the crinoid, the starfish, and the sea urchin. The\r\nstructure of echinoderms is radiate. Their integument is hardened\r\nwith plates or particles of carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nOf the free echinoderms, such as the starfish and the sea urchin,\r\nthe former has been found in the Cambrian rocks of Europe, but\r\nneither have so far been discovered in the strata of this period\r\nin North America. The stemmed and lower division of the\r\nechinoderms was represented by a primitive type, the CYSTOID, so\r\ncalled from its saclike form, A small globular or ovate \"calyx\" of\r\ncalcareous plates, with an aperture at the top for the mouth,\r\ninclosed the body of the animal, and was attached to the sea\r\nbottom by a short flexible stalk consisting of disks of carbonate\r\nof lime held together by a central ligament.\r\n\r\nARTHOPODS. These segmented animals with \"jointed feet,\" as their\r\nname suggests, may be divided in a general way into water\r\nbreathers and air breathers. The first-named and lower division\r\ncomprises the class of the CRUSTACEA,--arthropods protected by a\r\nhard exterior skeleton, or \"crust,\"--of which crabs, crayfish, and\r\nlobsters are familiar examples. The higher division, that of the\r\nair breathers, includes the following classes: spiders, scorpions,\r\ncentipedes, and insects.\r\n\r\nTHE TRILOBITE. The aquatic arthropods, the Crustacea, culminated\r\nbefore the air breathers; and while none of the latter are found\r\nin the Cambrian, the former were the dominant life of the time in\r\nnumbers, in size, and in the variety of their forms. The leading\r\ncrustacean type is the TRILOBITE, which takes its name from the\r\nthree lobes into which its shell is divided longitudinally. There\r\nare also three cross divisions,--the head shield, the tail shield,\r\nand between the two the thorax, consisting of a number of distinct\r\nand unconsolidated segments. The head shield carries a pair of\r\nlarge, crescentic, compound eyes, like those of the insect. The\r\neye varies greatly in the number of its lenses, ranging from\r\nfourteen in some species to fifteen thousand in others. Figure\r\n268, C, is a restoration of the trilobite, and shows the\r\nappendages, which are found preserved only in the rarest cases.\r\n\r\nDuring the long ages of the Cambrian the trilobite varied greatly.\r\nAgain and again new species and genera appeared, while the older\r\ntypes became extinct. For this reason and because of their\r\nabundance, trilobites are used in the classification of the\r\nCambrian system. The Lower Cambrian is characterized by the\r\npresence of a trilobitic fauna in which the genus Olenellus is\r\npredominant. This, the OLENELLUS ZONE, is one of the most\r\nimportant platforms in the entire geological series; for, the\r\nworld over, it marks the beginning of Paleozoic time, while all\r\nunderlying strata are classified as pre-Cambrian. The Middle\r\nCambrian is marked by the genus Paradoxides, and the Upper\r\nCambrian by the genus Olenus. Some of the Cambrian trilobites were\r\ngiants, measuring as much as two feet long, while others were the\r\nsmallest of their kind, a fraction of an inch in length.\r\n\r\nAnother type of crustacean which lived in the Cambrian and whose\r\norder is still living is illustrated in Figure 269.\r\n\r\nWORMS. Trails and burrows of worms have been left on the sea\r\nbeaches and mud flats of all geological times from the Algonkian\r\nto the present.\r\n\r\nBRACHIOPODS. These soft-bodied animals, with bivalve shells and\r\ntwo interior armlike processes which served for breathing,\r\nappeared in the Algonkian, and had now become very abundant. The\r\ntwo valves of the brachiopod shell are unequal in size, and in\r\neach valve a line drawn from the beak to the base divides the\r\nvalve into two equal parts. It may thus be told from the pelecypod\r\nmollusk, such as the clam, whose two valves are not far from equal\r\nin size, each being divided into unequal parts by a line dropped\r\nfrom the beak.\r\n\r\nBrachiopods include two orders. In the most primitive order--that\r\nof the INARTICULATE brachiopods--the two valves are held together\r\nonly by muscles of the animal, and the shell is horny or is\r\ncomposed of phosphate of lime. The DISCINA, which began in the\r\nAlgonkian, is of this type, as is also the LINGULELLA of the\r\nCambrian. Both of these genera have lived on during the millions\r\nof years of geological time since their introduction, handing down\r\nfrom generation to generation with hardly any change to their\r\ndescendants now living off our shores the characters impressed\r\nupon them at the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe more highly organized ARTICULATE brachiopods have valves of\r\ncarbonate of lime more securely joined by a hinge with teeth and\r\nsockets (Fig. 270). In the Cambrian the inarticulates predominate,\r\nthough the articulates grow common toward the end of the period.\r\n\r\nMOLLUSKS. The three chief classes of mollusks--the PELECYPODS\r\n(represented by the oyster and clam of to-day), the GASTROPODS\r\n(represented now by snails, conches, and periwinkles), and the\r\nCEPHALOPODS (such as the nautilus, cuttlefish, and squids)--were\r\nall represented in the Cambrian, although very sparingly.\r\n\r\nPteropods, a suborder of the gastropods, appeared in this age.\r\nTheir papery shells of carbonate of lime are found in great\r\nnumbers from this time on.\r\n\r\nCephalopods, the most highly organized of the mollusks, started\r\ninto existence, so far as the record shows, toward, the end of the\r\nCambrian, with the long extinct ORTHOCERAS (STRAIGHTHORN) and the\r\nallied genera of its family. The Orthoceras had a long, straight,\r\nand tapering shell, divided by cross partitions into chambers. The\r\nanimal lived in the \"body chamber\" at the larger end, and walled\r\noff the other chambers from it in succession during the growth of\r\nthe shell. A central tube, the SIPHUNCLE, passed through from the\r\nbody chamber to the closed tip of the cone.\r\n\r\nThe seashells, both brachiopods and mollusks, are in some respects\r\nthe most important to the geologist of all fossils. They have been\r\nso numerous, so widely distributed, and so well preserved because\r\nof their durable shells and their station in growing sediments,\r\nthat better than any other group of organisms they can be used to\r\ncorrelate the strata of different regions and to mark by their\r\nslow changes the advance of geological time.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE. The life of Cambrian times in different countries\r\ncontains no suggestion of any marked climatic zones, and as in\r\nlater periods a warm climate probably reached to the polar\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE ORDOVICIAN AND SILURIAN\r\n[Footnote: Often known as the Lower Silurian.]\r\n\r\nTHE ORDOVICIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn North America the Ordovician rocks lie conformably on the\r\nCambrian. The two periods, therefore, were not parted by any\r\ndeformation, either of mountain making or of continental uplift.\r\nThe general submergence which marked the Cambrian continued into\r\nthe succeeding period with little interruption.\r\n\r\nSUBDIVISIONS AND DISTRIBUTION OF STRATA. The Ordovician series, as\r\nthey have been made out in New York, are given for reference in\r\nthe following table, with the rocks of which they are chiefly\r\ncomposed:\r\n\r\n    5 Hudson . . . . . . . . shales\r\n    4 Utica  . . . . . . . . shales\r\n    3 Trenton  . . . . . . . limestones\r\n    2 Chazy  . . . . . . . . limestones\r\n    1 Calciferous  . . . . . sandy limestones\r\n\r\nThese marine formations of the Ordovician outcrop about the\r\nCambrian and pre-Cambrian areas, and, as borings show, extend far\r\nand wide over the interior of the continent beneath more recent\r\nstrata. The Ordovician sea stretched from Appalachia across the\r\nMississippi valley. It seems to have extended to California,\r\nalthough broken probably by several mountainous islands in the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. The physical history of the period is recorded\r\nin the succession of its formations. The sandstones of the Upper\r\nCambrian, as we have learned, tell of a transgressing sea which\r\ngradually came to occupy the Mississippi valley and the interior\r\nof North America. The limestones of the early and middle\r\nOrdovician show that now the shore had become remote and the lands\r\nhad become more low. The waters now had cleared. Colonies of\r\nbrachiopods and other lime-secreting animals occupied the sea\r\nbottom, and their debris mantled it with sheets of limy ooze. The\r\nsandy limestones of the Calciferous record the transition stage\r\nfrom the Cambrian when some sand was still brought in from shore.\r\nThe highly fossiliferous limestones of the Trenton tell of clear\r\nwater and abundant life. We need not regard this epicontinental\r\nsea as deep. No abysmal deposits have been found, and the\r\nlimestones of the period are those which would be laid in clear,\r\nwarm water of moderate depth like that of modern coral seas.\r\n\r\nThe shales of the Utica and Hudson show that the waters of the sea\r\nnow became clouded with mud washed in from land. Either the land\r\nwas gradually uplifted, or perhaps there had arrived one of those\r\nperiodic crises which, as we may imagine, have taken place\r\nwhenever the crust of the shrinking earth has slowly given way\r\nover its great depressions, and the ocean has withdrawn its waters\r\ninto deepening abysses. The land was thus left relatively higher\r\nand bordered with new coastal plains. The epicontinental sea was\r\nshoaled and narrowed, and muds were washed in from the adjacent\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nTHE TACONIC DEFORMATION. The Ordovician was closed by a\r\ndeformation whose extent and severity are not yet known. From the\r\nSt. Lawrence River to New York Bay, along the northwestern and\r\nwestern border of New England, lies a belt of Cambrian-Ordovician\r\nrocks more than a mile in total thickness, which accumulated\r\nduring the long ages of those periods in a gradually subsiding\r\ntrough between the Adirondacks and a pre-Cambrian range lying west\r\nof the Connecticut River. But since their deposition these ancient\r\nsediments have been crumpled and crushed, broken with great\r\nfaults, and extensively metamorphosed. The limestones have\r\nrecrystallized into marbles, among them the famous marbles of\r\nVermont; the Cambrian sandstones have become quartzites, and the\r\nHudson shale has been changed to a schist exposed on Manhattan\r\nIsland and northward.\r\n\r\nIn part these changes occurred at the close of the Ordovician, for\r\nin several places beds of Silurian age rest unconformably on the\r\nupturned Ordovician strata; but recent investigations have made it\r\nprobable that the crustal movements recurred at later times, and\r\nit was perhaps in the Devonian and at the close of the\r\nCarboniferous that the greater part of the deformation and\r\nmetamorphism was accomplished. As a result of these movements,--\r\nperhaps several times repeated,--a great mountain range was\r\nupridged, which has been long since leveled by erosion, but whose\r\nroots are now visible in the Taconic Mountains of western New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nTHE CINCINNATI ANTICLINE. Over an oval area in Ohio, Indiana, and\r\nKentucky, whose longer axis extends from north to south through\r\nCincinnati, the Ordovician strata rise in a very low, broad swell,\r\ncalled the Cincinnati anticline. The Silurian and Devonian strata\r\nthin out as they approach this area and seem never to have\r\ndeposited upon it. We may regard it, therefore, as an island\r\nupwarped from the sea at the close of the Ordovician or shortly\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nPETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS. These valuable illuminants and fuels\r\nare considered here because, although they are found in traces in\r\nolder strata, it is in the Ordovician that they occur for the\r\nfirst time in large quantities. They range throughout later\r\nformations down to the most recent.\r\n\r\nThe oil horizons of California and Texas are Tertiary; those of\r\nColorado, Cretaceous; those of West Virginia, Carboniferous; those\r\nof Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Canada, Devonian; and the large\r\nfield of Ohio and Indiana belongs to the Ordovician and higher\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nPetroleum and natural gas, wherever found, have probably\r\noriginated from the decay of organic matter when buried in\r\nsedimentary deposits, just as at present in swampy places the\r\nhydrogen and carbon of decaying vegetation combine to form marsh\r\ngas. The light and heat of these hydrocarbons we may think of,\r\ntherefore, as a gift to the civilized life of our race from the\r\nhumble organisms, both animal and vegetable, of the remote past,\r\nwhose remains were entombed in the sediments of the Ordovician and\r\nlater geological ages.\r\n\r\nPetroleum is very widely disseminated throughout the stratified\r\nrocks. Certain limestones are visibly greasy with it, and others\r\ngive off its characteristic fetid odor when struck with a hammer.\r\nMany shales are bituminous, and some are so highly charged that\r\nsmall flakes may be lighted like tapers, and several gallons of\r\noil to the ton may be obtained by distillation.\r\n\r\nBut oil and gas are found in paying quantities only when certain\r\nconditions meet:\r\n\r\n1. A SOURCE below, usually a bituminous shale, from whose organic\r\nmatter they have been derived by slow change.\r\n\r\n2. A RESERVOIR above, in which they have gathered. This is either\r\na porous sandstone or a porous or creviced limestone.\r\n\r\n3. Oil and gas are lighter than water, and are usually under\r\npressure owing to artesian water. Hence, in order to hold them\r\nfrom escaping to the surface, the reservoir must have the shape of\r\nan ANTICLINE, DOME, or LENS.\r\n\r\n4. It must also have an IMPERVIOUS COVER, usually a shale. In\r\nthese reservoirs gas is under a pressure which is often enormous,\r\nreaching in extreme cases as high as a thousand five hundred\r\npounds to the square inch. When tapped it rushes out with a\r\ndeafening roar, sometimes flinging the heavy drill high in air. In\r\naccounting for this pressure we must remember that the gas has\r\nbeen compressed within the pores of the reservoir rock by artesian\r\nwater, and in some cases also by its own expansive force. It is\r\nnot uncommon for artesian water to rise in wells after the\r\nexhaustion of gas and oil.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THE ORDOVICIAN\r\n\r\nDuring the ages of the Ordovician, life made great advances. Types\r\nalready present branched widely into new genera and species, and\r\nnew and higher types appeared.\r\n\r\nSponges continued from the Cambrian. Graptolites now reached their\r\nclimax.\r\n\r\nSTROMATOPORA--colonies of minute hydrozoans allied to corals--grew\r\nin places on the sea floor, secreting stony masses composed of\r\nthin, close, concentric layers, connected by vertical rods. The\r\nStromatopora are among the chief limestone builders of the\r\nSilurian and Devonian periods.\r\n\r\nCORALS developed along several distinct lines, like modern corals\r\nthey secreted a calcareous framework, in whose outer portions the\r\npolyps lived. In the Ordovician, corals were represented chiefly\r\nby the family of the CHOETETES, all species of which are long\r\nsince extinct. The description of other types of corals will be\r\ngiven under the Silurian, where they first became abundant.\r\n\r\nECHINODERMS. The cystoid reaches its climax, but there appear now\r\ntwo higher types of echinoderms,--the crinoid and the starfish.\r\nThe CRINOID, named from its resemblance to the lily, is like the\r\ncystoid in many respects, but has a longer stem and supports a\r\ncrown of plumose arms. Stirring the water with these arms, it\r\ncreates currents by which particles of food are wafted to its\r\nmouth. Crinoids are rare at the present time, but they grew in the\r\ngreatest profusion in the warm Ordovician seas and for long ages\r\nthereafter. In many places the sea floor was beautiful with these\r\ngraceful, flowerlike forms, as with fields of long-stemmed lilies.\r\nOf the higher, free-moving classes of the echinoderms, starfish\r\nare more numerous than in the Cambrian, and sea urchins make their\r\nappearance in rare archaic forms.\r\n\r\nCRUSTACEANS. Trilobites now reach their greatest development and\r\nmore than eleven hundred species have been described from the\r\nrocks of this period. It is interesting to note that in many\r\nspecies the segments of the thorax have now come to be so shaped\r\nthat they move freely on one another. Unlike their Cambrian\r\nancestors, many of the Ordovician trilobites could roll themselves\r\ninto balls at the approach of danger. It is in this attitude,\r\ntaken at the approach of death, that trilobites are often found in\r\nthe Ordovician and later rocks. The gigantic crustaceans called\r\nthe EURYPTERIDS were also present in this period.\r\n\r\nThe arthropods had now seized upon the land. Centipedes and\r\ninsects of a low type, the earliest known land animals, have been\r\ndiscovered in strata of this system.\r\n\r\nBRYOZOANS. No fossils are more common in the limestones of the\r\ntime than the small branching stems and lacelike mats of the\r\nbryozoans,--the skeletons of colonies of a minute animal allied in\r\nstructure to the brachiopod.\r\n\r\nBRACHIOPODS. These multiplied greatly, and in places their shells\r\nformed thick beds of coquina. They still greatly surpassed the\r\nmollusks in numbers.\r\n\r\nCEPHALOPODS. Among the mollusks we must note the evolution of the\r\ncephalopods. The primitive straight Orthoceras has now become\r\nabundant. But in addition to this ancestral type there appears a\r\nsuccession of forms more and more curved and closely coiled, as\r\nillustrated in Figure 285. The nautilus, which began its course in\r\nthis period, crawls on the bottom of our present seas.\r\n\r\nVERTEBRATES. The most important record of the Ordovician is that\r\nof the appearance of a new and higher type, with possibilities of\r\ndevelopment lying hidden in its structure that the mollusk and the\r\ninsect could never hope to reach. Scales and plates of minute\r\nfishes found in the Ordovician rocks near Canon City, Colorado,\r\nshow that the humblest of the vertebrates had already made its\r\nappearance. But it is probable that vertebrates had been on the\r\nearth for ages before this in lowly types, which, being destitute\r\nof hard parts, would leave no record.\r\n\r\nTHE SILURIAN\r\n\r\nThe narrowing of the seas and the emergence of the lands which\r\ncharacterized the closing epoch of the Ordovician in eastern North\r\nAmerica continue into the succeeding period of the Silurian. New\r\nspecies appear and many old species now become extinct.\r\n\r\nTHE APPALACHIAN REGION. Where the Silurian system is most fully\r\ndeveloped, from New York southward along the Appalachian\r\nMountains, it comprises four series:\r\n\r\n    4 Salina  . . . shales, impure limestones, gypsum, salt\r\n    3 Niagara . . . chiefly limestones\r\n    2 Clinton . . . sandstones, shales, with some limestones\r\n    1 Medina  . . . conglomerates, sandstones\r\n\r\nThe rocks of these series are shallow-water deposits and reach the\r\ntotal thickness of some five thousand feet. Evidently they were\r\nlaid over an area which was on the whole gradually subsiding,\r\nalthough with various gentle oscillations which are recorded in\r\nthe different formations. The coarse sands of the heavy Medina\r\nformations record a period of uplift of the oldland of Appalachia,\r\nwhen erosion went on rapidly and coarse waste in abundance was\r\nbrought down from the hills by swift streams and spread by the\r\nwaves in wide, sandy flats. As the lands were worn lower the waste\r\nbecame finer, and during an epoch of transition--the Clinton--\r\nthere were deposited various formations of sandstones, shales, and\r\nlimestones. The Niagara limestones testify to a long epoch of\r\nrepose, when low-lying lands sent little waste down to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe gypsum and salt deposits of the Salina show that toward the\r\nclose of the Silurian period a slight oscillation brought the sea\r\nfloor nearer to the surface, and at the north cut off extensive\r\ntracts from the interior sea. In these wide lagoons, which now and\r\nthen regained access to the open sea and obtained new supplies of\r\nsalt water, beds of salt and gypsum were deposited as the briny\r\nwaters became concentrated by evaporation under a desert climate.\r\nAlong with these beds there were also laid shales and impure\r\nlimestones.\r\n\r\nIn New York the \"salt pans\" of the Salina extended over an area\r\none hundred and fifty miles long from east to west and sixty miles\r\nwide, and similar salt marshes occurred as far west as Cleveland,\r\nOhio, and Goderich on Lake Huron. At Ithaca, New York, the series\r\nis fifteen hundred feet thick, and is buried beneath an equal\r\nthickness of later strata. It includes two hundred and fifty feet\r\nof solid salt, in several distinct beds, each sealed within the\r\nshales of the series.\r\n\r\nWould you expect to find ancient beds of rock salt inclosed in\r\nbeds of pervious sandstone?\r\n\r\nThe salt beds of the Salina are of great value. They are reached\r\nby well borings, and their brines are evaporated by solar heat and\r\nby boiling. The rock salt is also mined from deep shafts.\r\n\r\nSimilar deposits of salt, formed under like conditions, occur in\r\nthe rocks of later systems down to the present. The salt beds of\r\nTexas are Permian, those of Kansas are Permian, and those of\r\nLouisiana are Tertiary.\r\n\r\nTHE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. The heavy near-shore formations of the\r\nSilurian in the Appalachian region thin out toward the west. The\r\nMedina and the Clinton sandstones are not found west of Ohio,\r\nwhere the first passes into a shale and the second into a\r\nlimestone. The Niagara limestone, however, spreads from the Hudson\r\nRiver to beyond the Mississippi, a distance of more than a\r\nthousand miles. During the Silurian period the Mississippi valley\r\nregion was covered with a quiet, shallow, limestone-making sea,\r\nwhich received little waste from the low lands which bordered it.\r\n\r\nThe probable distribution of land and sea in eastern North America\r\nand western Europe is shown in Figure 287. The fauna of the\r\ninterior region and of eastern Canada are closely allied with that\r\nof western Europe, and several species are identical. We can\r\nhardly account for this except by a shallow-water connection\r\nbetween the two ancient epicontinental seas. It was perhaps along\r\nthe coastal shelves of a northern land connecting America and\r\nEurope by way of Greenland and Iceland that the migration took\r\nplace, so that the same species came to live in Iowa and in\r\nSweden.\r\n\r\nTHE WESTERN UNITED STATES. So little is found of the rocks of the\r\nsystem west of the Missouri River that it is quite probable that\r\nthe western part of the United States had for the most part\r\nemerged from the sea at the close of the Ordovician and remained\r\nland during the Silurian. At the same time the western land was\r\nperhaps connected with the eastern land of Appalachia across\r\nArkansas and Mississippi; for toward the south the Silurian\r\nsediments indicate an approach to shore.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THE SILURIAN\r\n\r\nIn this brief sketch it is quite impossible to relate the many\r\nchanges of species and genera during the Silurian.\r\n\r\nCORALS. Some of the more common types are familiarly known as cup\r\ncorals, honeycomb corals, and chain corals. In the CUP CORALS the\r\nmost important feature is the development of radiating vertical\r\npartitions, or SEPTA, in the cell of the polyp. Some of the cup\r\ncorals grew in hemispherical colonies (Fig. 288), while many were\r\nseparate individuals (Fig. 289), building a single conical, or\r\nhorn-shaped cell, which sometimes reached the extreme size of a\r\nfoot in length and two or three inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nHONEYCOMB CORALS consist of masses of small, close-set prismatic\r\ncells, each crossed by horizontal partitions, or TABULAE, while\r\nthe septa are rudimentary, being represented by faintly projecting\r\nridges or rows of spines.\r\n\r\nCHAIN CORALS are also marked by tabulae. Their cells form\r\nelliptical tubes, touching each other at the edges, and appearing\r\nin cross section like the links of a chain. They became extinct at\r\nthe end of the Silurian.\r\n\r\nThe corals of the SYRINGOPORA family are similar in structure to\r\nchain corals, but the tubular columns are connected only in\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nTo the echinoderms there is now added the BLASTOID (bud-shaped).\r\nThe blastoid is stemmed and armless, and its globular \"head\" or\r\n\"calyx,\" with its five petal-like divisions, resembles a flower\r\nbud. The blastoids became more abundant in the Devonian,\r\nculminated in the Carboniferous, and disappeared at the end of the\r\nPaleozoic.\r\n\r\nThe great eurypterids--some of which were five or six feet in\r\nlength--and the cephalopods were still masters of the seas. Fishes\r\nwere as yet few and small; trilobites and graptolites had now\r\npassed their prime and had diminished greatly in numbers.\r\nScorpions are found in this period both in Europe and in America.\r\nThe limestone-making seas of the Silurian swarmed with corals,\r\ncrinoids, and brachiopods.\r\n\r\nWith the end of the Silurian period the AGE OF INVERTEBRATES comes\r\nto a close, giving place to the Devonian, the AGE OF FISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE DEVONIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn America the Silurian is not separated from the Devonian by any\r\nmountain-making deformation or continental uplift. The one period\r\npassed quietly into the other. Their conformable systems are so\r\nclosely related, and the change in their faunas is so gradual,\r\nthat geologists are not agreed as to the precise horizon which\r\ndivides them.\r\n\r\nSUBDIVISIONS AND PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. The Devonian is represented\r\nin New York and southward by the following five series. We add the\r\nrocks of which they are chiefly composed.\r\n\r\n    5 Chemung     . . . . . . sandstones and sandy shales\r\n    4 Hamilton    . . . . . . shales and sandstones\r\n    3 Corniferous . . . . . . limestones\r\n    2 Oriskany    . . . . . . sandstones\r\n    1 Helderberg  . . . . . . limestones\r\n\r\nThe Helderberg is a transition epoch referred by some geologists\r\nto the Silurian. The thin sandstones of the Oriskany mark an epoch\r\nwhen waves worked over the deposits of former coastal plains. The\r\nlimestones of the Corniferous testify to a warm and clear wide sea\r\nwhich extended from the Hudson to beyond the Mississippi. Corals\r\nthrove luxuriantly, and their remains, with those of mollusks and\r\nother lime-secreting animals, built up great beds of limestone.\r\nThe bordering continents, as during the later Silurian, must now\r\nhave been monotonous lowlands which sent down little of even the\r\nfinest waste to the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the Hamilton the clear seas of the previous epoch became\r\nclouded with mud. The immense deposits of coarse sandstones and\r\nsandy shales of the Chemung, which are found off what was at the\r\ntime the west coast of Appalachia, prove an uplift of that ancient\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThe Chemung series extends from the Catskill Mountains to\r\nnortheastern Ohio and south to northeastern Tennessee, covering an\r\narea of not less than a hundred thousand square miles. In eastern\r\nNew York it attains three thousand feet in thickness; in\r\nPennsylvania it reaches the enormous thickness of two miles; but\r\nit rapidly thins to the west. Everywhere the Chemung is made of\r\nthin beds of rapidly alternating coarse and fine sands and clays,\r\nwith an occasional pebble layer, and hence is a shallow-water\r\ndeposit. The fine material has not been thoroughly winnowed from\r\nthe coarse by the long action of strong waves and tides. The sands\r\nand clays have undergone little more sorting than is done by\r\nrivers. We must regard the Chemung sandstones as deposits made at\r\nthe mouths of swift, turbid rivers in such great amount that they\r\ncould be little sorted and distributed by waves.\r\n\r\nOver considerable areas the Chemung sandstones bear little or no\r\ntrace of the action of the sea. The Catskill Mountains, for\r\nexample, have as their summit layers some three thousand feet of\r\ncoarse red sandstones of this series, whose structure is that of\r\nriver deposits, and whose few fossils are chiefly of fresh-water\r\ntypes. The Chemung is therefore composed of delta deposits, more\r\nor less worked over by the sea. The bulk of the Chemung equals\r\nthat of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. To furnish this immense\r\nvolume of sediment a great mountain range, or highland, must have\r\nbeen upheaved where the Appalachian lowland long had been. To what\r\nheight the Devonian mountains of Appalachia attained cannot be\r\ntold from the volume of the sediments wasted from them, for they\r\nmay have risen but little faster than they were worn down by\r\ndenudation. We may infer from the character of the waste which\r\nthey furnished to the Chemung shores that they did not reach an\r\nAlpine height. The grains of the Chemung sandstones are not those\r\nwhich would result from mechanical disintegration, as by frost on\r\nhigh mountain peaks, but are rather those which would be left from\r\nthe long chemical decay of siliceous crystalline rocks; for the\r\nmore soluble minerals are largely wanting. The red color of much\r\nof the deposits points to the same conclusion. Red residual clays\r\naccumulated on the mountain sides and upland summits, and were\r\nwashed as ocherous silt to mingle with the delta sands. The iron-\r\nbearing igneous rocks of the oldland also contributed by their\r\ndecay iron in solution to the rivers, to be deposited in films of\r\niron oxide about the quartz grains of the Chemung sandstones,\r\ngiving them their reddish tints.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THE DEVONIAN\r\n\r\nPLANTS. The lands were probably clad with verdure during Silurian\r\ntimes, if not still earlier; for some rare remains of ferns and\r\nother lowly types of vegetation have been found in the strata of\r\nthat system. But it is in the Devonian that we discover for the\r\nfirst time the remains of extensive and luxuriant forests. This\r\nrich flora reached its climax in the Carboniferous, and it will be\r\nmore convenient to describe its varied types in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nRHIZOCARPS. In the shales of the Devonian are found microscopic\r\nspores of rhizocarps in such countless numbers that their weight\r\nmust be reckoned in hundreds of millions of tons. It would seem\r\nthat these aquatic plants culminated in this period, and in widely\r\ndistant portions of the earth swampy flats and shallow lagoons\r\nwere filled with vegetation of this humble type, either growing\r\nfrom the bottom or floating free upon the surface. It is to the\r\nresinous spores of the rhizocarps that the petroleum and natural\r\ngas from Devonian rocks are largely due. The decomposition of the\r\nspores has made the shales highly bituminous, and the oil and gas\r\nhave accumulated in the reservoirs of overlying porous sandstones.\r\n\r\nINVERTEBRATES. We must pass over the ever-changing groups of the\r\ninvertebrates with the briefest notice. Chain corals became\r\nextinct at the close of the Silurian, but other corals were\r\nextremely common in the Devonian seas. At many places corals\r\nformed thin reefs, as at Louisville, Kentucky, where the hardness\r\nof the reef rock is one of the causes of the Falls of the Ohio.\r\n\r\nSponges, echinoderms, brachiopods, and mollusks were abundant. The\r\ncephalopods take a new departure. So far in all their various\r\nforms, whether straight, as the Orthoceras, or curved, or close-\r\ncoiled as in the nautilus, the septum, or partition dividing the\r\nchambers, met the inner shell along a simple line, like that of\r\nthe rim of a saucer. There now begins a growth of the septum by\r\nwhich its edges become sharply corrugated, and the suture, or line\r\nof juncture of the septum and the shell, is thus angled. The group\r\nin which this growth of the septum takes place is called the\r\nGONIATITE (Greek GONIA, angle).\r\n\r\nVERTEBRATES. It is with the greatest interest that we turn now to\r\nstudy the backboned animals of the Devonian; for they are believed\r\nto be the ancestors of the hosts of vertebrates which have since\r\ndominated the earth. Their rudimentary structures foreshadowed\r\nwhat their descendants were to be, and give some clue to the\r\nearliest vertebrates from which they sprang. Like those whose\r\nremains are found in the lower Paleozoic systems, all of these\r\nDevonian vertebrates were aquatic and go under the general\r\ndesignation of fishes.\r\n\r\nThe lowest in grade and nearest, perhaps, to the ancestral type of\r\nvertebrates, was the problematic creature, an inch or so long, of\r\nFigure 297. Note the circular mouth not supplied with jaws, the\r\nlack of paired fins, and the symmetric tail fin, with the column\r\nof cartilaginous, ringlike vertebrae running through it to the\r\nend. The animal is probably to be placed with the jawless lampreys\r\nand hags,--a group too low to be included among true fishes.\r\n\r\nOSTRACODERMS. This archaic group, long since extinct, is also too\r\nlowly to rank among the true fishes, for its members have neither\r\njaws nor paired fins. These small, fishlike forms were cased in\r\nfront with bony plates developed in the skin and covered in the\r\nrear with scales. The vertebrae were not ossified, for no trace of\r\nthem has been found.\r\n\r\nDEVONIAN FISHES. The TRUE FISHES of the Devonian can best be\r\nunderstood by reference to their descendants now living. Modern\r\nfishes are divided into several groups: SHARKS and their allies;\r\nDIPNOANS; GANOIDS, such as the sturgeon and gar; and TELEOSTS,--\r\nmost common fishes, such as the perch and cod.\r\n\r\nSHARKS. Of all groups of living fishes the sharks are the oldest\r\nand still retain most fully the embryonic characters of their\r\nPaleozoic ancestors. Such characters are the cartilaginous\r\nskeleton, and the separate gill slits with which the throat wall\r\nis pierced and which are arranged in line like the gill openings\r\nof the lamprey. The sharks of the Silurian and Devonian are known\r\nto us chiefly by their teeth and fin spines, for they were\r\nunprotected by scales or plates, and were devoid of a bony\r\nskeleton. Figure 299 is a restoration of an archaic shark from a\r\nsomewhat higher horizon. Note the seven gill slits and the\r\nlappetlike paired fins. These fins seem to be remnants of the\r\ncontinuous fold of skin which, as embryology teaches, passed from\r\nfore to aft down each side of the primitive vertebrate.\r\n\r\nDevonian sharks were comparatively small. They had not evolved\r\ninto the ferocious monsters which were later to be masters of the\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nDIPNOANS, OR LUNG FISHES. These are represented to-day by a\r\nfew peculiar fishes and are distinguished by some high structures\r\nwhich ally them with amphibians. An air sac with cellular spaces\r\nis connected with the gullet and serves as a rudimentary lung. It\r\ncorresponds with the swim bladder of most modern fishes, and\r\nappears to have had a common origin with it. We may conceive that\r\nthe primordial fishes not only had gills used in breathing air\r\ndissolved in water, but also developed a saclike pouch off the\r\ngullet. This sac evolved along two distinct lines. On the line of\r\nthe ancestry of most modern fishes its duct was closed and it\r\nbecame the swim bladder used in flotation and balancing. On\r\nanother line of descent it was left open, air was swallowed into\r\nit, and it developed into the rudimentary lung of the dipnoans and\r\ninto the more perfect lungs of the amphibians and other air-\r\nbreathing vertebrates.\r\n\r\nOne of the ancient dipnoans is illustrated in Figure 300. Some of\r\nthe members of this order were, like the ostracoderms, cased in\r\narmor, but their higher rank is shown by their powerful jaws and\r\nby other structures. Some of these armored fishes reached twenty-\r\nfive feet in length and six feet across the head. They were the\r\ntyrants of the Devonian seas.\r\n\r\nGANOIDS. These take their name from their enameled plates or\r\nscales of bone. The few genera now surviving are the descendants\r\nof the tribes which swarmed in the Devonian seas. A restoration of\r\none of a leading order, the FRINGE-FINNED ganoids, is given in\r\nFigure 301. The side fins, which correspond to the limbs of the\r\nhigher vertebrates, are quite unlike those of most modern fishes.\r\nTheir rays, instead of radiating from a common base, fringe a\r\ncentral lobe which contains a cartilaginous axis. The teeth of the\r\nDevonian ganoids show a complicated folded structure.\r\n\r\nGENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF DEVONIAN FISHES. THE NOTOCHORD IS\r\nPERSISTENT. The notochord is a continuous rod of cartilage, or\r\ngristle, which in the embryological growth of vertebrate animals\r\nsupports the spinal nerve cord before the formation of the\r\nvertebrae. In most modern fishes and in all higher vertebrates the\r\nnotochord is gradually removed as the bodies of the vertebrae are\r\nformed about it; but in the Devonian fishes it persists through\r\nmaturity and the vertebrae remain incomplete.\r\n\r\nTHE SKELETON IS CARTILAGINOUS. This also is an embryological\r\ncharacteristic. In the Devonian fishes the vertebrae, as well as\r\nthe other parts of the skeleton, have not ossified, or changed to\r\nbone, but remain in their primitive cartilaginous condition.\r\n\r\nTHE TAIL FIN IS VERTEBRATED. The backbone runs through the fin and\r\nis fringed above and below with its vertical rays. In some fishes\r\nwith vertebrated tail fins the fin is symmetric, and this seems to\r\nbe the primitive type. In others the tail fin is unsymmetric: the\r\nbackbone runs into the upper lobe, leaving the two lobes of\r\nunequal size. In most modern fishes (the teleosts) the tail fin is\r\nnot vertebrated: the spinal column ends in a broad plate, to which\r\nthe diverging fin rays are attached.\r\n\r\nBut along with these embryonic characters, which were common to\r\nall Devonian fishes, there were other structures in certain groups\r\nwhich foreshadowed the higher structures of the land vertebrates\r\nwhich were yet to come: air sacs which were to develop into lungs,\r\nand cartilaginous axes in the side fins which were a prophecy of\r\nlimbs. The vertebrates had already advanced far enough to prove\r\nthe superiority of their type of structure to all others. Their\r\ninternal skeleton afforded the best attachment for muscles and\r\nenabled them to become the largest and most powerful creatures of\r\nthe time. The central nervous system, with the predominance given\r\nto the ganglia at the fore end of the nerve cord,--the brain,--\r\nalready endowed them with greater energy than the invertebrates;\r\nand, still more important, these structures contained the\r\npossibility of development into the more highly organized land\r\nvertebrates which were to rule the earth.\r\n\r\nTELEOSTS. The great group of fishes called the teleosts, or those\r\nwith complete bony skeletons, to which most modern fishes belong,\r\nmay be mentioned here, although in the Devonian they had not yet\r\nappeared. The teleosts are a highly specialized type, adapted most\r\nperfectly to their aquatic environment. Heavy armor has been\r\ndiscarded, and reliance is placed instead on swiftness. The\r\nskeleton is completely ossified and the notochord removed. The\r\nvertebrae have been economically withdrawn from the tail, and the\r\ncartilaginous axis of the side fins has been fotfoid unnecessary.\r\nThe air sac has become a swim bladder. In this complete\r\nspecialization they have long since lost the possibility of\r\nevolving into higher types.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the modern teleosts in their\r\nembryological growth pass through the stages which characterized\r\nthe maturity of their Devonian ancestors; their skeleton is\r\ncartilaginous and their tail fin vertebrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE CARBONIFEROUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous system is so named from the large amount of\r\ncoal which it contains. Other systems, from the Devonian on, are\r\ncoal bearing also, but none so richly and to so wide an extent.\r\nNever before or since have the peculiar conditions been so\r\nfavorable for the formation of extensive coal deposits.\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions the Carboniferous strata rest on those of the\r\nDevonian without any marked unconformity; the one period passed\r\nquietly into the other, with no great physical disturbances.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous includes three distinct series. The lower is\r\ncalled the MISSISSIPPIAN, from the outcrop of its formations along\r\nthe Mississippi River in central and southern Illinois and the\r\nadjacent portions of Iowa and Missouri. The middle series is\r\ncalled the PENNSYLVANIAN (or Coal Measures), from its wide\r\noccurrence over Pennsylvania. The upper series is named the\r\nPERMIAN, from the province of Perm in Russia.\r\n\r\nTHE MISSISSIPPIAN SERIES. In the interior the Mississippian is\r\ncomposed chiefly of limestones, with some shales, which tell of a\r\nclear, warm, epicontinental sea swarming with crinoids, corals,\r\nand shells, and occasionally clouded with silt from the land.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern region, New York had been added by uplift to the\r\nAppalachian land which now was united to the northern area. From\r\neastern Pennsylvania southward there were laid in a subsiding\r\ntrough, first, thick sandstones (the Pocono sandstone), and later\r\nstill heavier shales,--the two together reaching the thickness of\r\nfour thousand feet and more. We infer a renewed uplift of\r\nAppalachia similar to that of the later epochs of the Devonian,\r\nbut as much less in amount as the volume of sediments is smaller.\r\n\r\nTHE PENNSYLVANIAN SERIES\r\n\r\nThe Mississippian was brought to an end by a quiet oscillation\r\nwhich lifted large areas slightly above the sea, and the\r\nPennsylvanian began with a movement in the opposite direction. The\r\nsea encroached on the new land, and spread far and wide a great\r\nbasal conglomerate and coarse sandstones. On this ancient beach\r\ndeposit a group of strata rests which we must now interpret. They\r\nconsist of alternating shales and sandstones, with here and there\r\na bed of limestone and an occasional seam of coal. A stratum of\r\nfire clay commonly underlies a coal seam, and there occur also\r\nbeds of iron ore. We give a typical section of a very small\r\nportion of the series at a locality in Pennyslvania. Although some\r\nof the minor changes are omitted, the section shows the rapid\r\nalternation of the strata:\r\n\r\n                                          Feet\r\n    9 Sandstone and shale . . . . . . . . 25\r\n    8 Limestone . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\r\n    7 Sandstone . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\r\n    6 Coal  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  1-6\r\n    5 Shale . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  0-2\r\n    4 Sandstone . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40\r\n    3 Limestone . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\r\n    2 Coal  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  5-12\r\n    1 Fire clay . . . . . . . . . . . . .  3\r\n\r\nThis section shows more coal than is usual; on the whole, coal\r\nseams do not take up more than one foot in fifty of the Coal\r\nMeasures. They vary also in thickness more than is seen in the\r\nsection, some exceptional seams reaching the thickness of fifty\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nHOW COAL WAS MADE.\r\n\r\n1. Coal is of vegetable origin. Examined under the microscope even\r\nanthracite, or hard coal, is seen to contain carbonized vegetal\r\ntissues. There are also all gradations connecting the hardest\r\nanthracite--through semibituminous coal, bituminous or soft coal,\r\nlignite (an imperfect coal in which sometimes woody fibers may be\r\nseen little changed)--with peat and decaying vegetable tissues.\r\nCoal is compressed and mineralized vegetal matter. Its varieties\r\ndepend on the perfection to which the peculiar change called\r\nbituminization has been carried, and also, as shown in the table\r\nbelow, on the degree to which the volatile substances and water\r\nhave escaped, and on the per cent of carbon remaining.\r\n\r\n                       Peat      Lignite   Bituminous Coal\r\nAnthracite\r\n                   Dismal Swamp   Texas         Penn.\r\nPenn.\r\n    Moisture  . . . . 78.89       14.67          1.30           2.74\r\n    Volatile matter . 13.84       37.32         20.87           4.25\r\n    Fixed carbon  . .  6.49       41.07         67.20          81.51\r\n    Ash . . . . . . .  0.78        6.69          8.80          10.87\r\n\r\n2. The vegetable remains associated with coal are those of land\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n3. Coal accumulated in the presence of water; for it is only when\r\nthus protected from the air that vegetal matter is preserved.\r\n\r\n4. The vegetation of coal accumulated for the most part where it\r\ngrew; it was not generally drifted and deposited by waves and\r\ncurrents. Commonly the fire clay beneath the seam is penetrated\r\nwith roots, and the shale above is packed with leaves of ferns and\r\nother plants as beautifully pressed as in a herbarium. There often\r\nis associated with the seam a fossil forest, with the stumps,\r\nwhich are still standing where they grew, their spreading roots,\r\nand the soil beneath, all changed to stone. In the Nova Scotia\r\nfield, out of seventy-six distinct coal seams, twenty are\r\nunderlain by old forest grounds.\r\n\r\nThe presence of fire clay beneath a seam points in the same\r\ndirection. Such underclays withstand intense heat and are used in\r\nmaking fire brick, because their alkalies have been removed by the\r\nlong-continued growth of vegetation.\r\n\r\nFuel coal is also too pure to have been accumulated by driftage.\r\nIn that case we should expect to find it mixed with mud, while in\r\nfact it often contains no more ash than the vegetal matter would\r\nfurnish from which it has been compressed.\r\n\r\nThese conditions are fairly met in the great swamps of river\r\nplains and deltas and of coastal plains, such as the great Dismal\r\nSwamp, where thousands of generations of forests with their\r\nundergrowths contribute their stems and leaves to form thick beds\r\nof peat. A coal seam is a fossil peat bed.\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS DURING THE PENNSYLVANIAN. The\r\nCarboniferous peat swamps were of vast extent. A map of the Coal\r\nMeasures (Fig. 260) shows that the coal marshes stretched, with\r\nvarious interruptions of higher ground and straits of open water,\r\nfrom eastern Pennsylvania into Alabama, Texas, and Kansas. Some\r\nindividual coal beds may still be traced over a thousand square\r\nmiles, despite the erosion which they have suffered. It taxes the\r\nimagination to conceive that the varied region included within\r\nthese limits was for hundreds of thousands of years a marshy plain\r\ncovered with tropical jungles such as that pictured in Figure 304.\r\n\r\nOn the basis that peat loses four fifths of its bulk in changing\r\nto coal, we may reckon the thickness of these ancient peat beds.\r\nCoal seams six and ten feet thick, which are not uncommon,\r\nrepresent peat beds thirty and fifty feet in thickness, while\r\nmammoth coal seams fifty feet thick have been compressed from peat\r\nbeds two hundred and fifty feet deep.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the thousands of feet of marine and freshwater\r\nsediments, with their repeated alternations of limestones,\r\nsandstones, and shales, in which the seams of coal occur, prove a\r\nslow subsidence, with many changes in its rate, with halts when\r\nthe land was at a stillstand, and with occasional movements\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nWhen subsidence was most rapid and long continued the sea\r\nencroached far and wide upon the lowlands and covered the coal\r\nswamps with sands and muds and limy oozes. When subsidence\r\nslackened or ceased the land gained on the sea. Bays were barred,\r\nand lagoons as they gradually filled with mud became marshes.\r\nRiver deltas pushed forward, burying with their silts the sunken\r\npeat beds of earlier centuries, and at the surface emerged in\r\nbroad, swampy flats,--like those of the deltas of the Mississippi\r\nand the Ganges,--which soon were covered with luxuriant forests.\r\nAt times a gentle uplift brought to sea level great coastal\r\nplains, which for ages remained mantled with the jungle, their\r\nundeveloped drainage clogged with its debris, and were then again\r\nsubmerged.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE SEVERAL REGIONS. THE ACADIAN REGION lay\r\non the eastern side of the northern land, where now are New\r\nBrunswick and Nova Scotia, and was an immense river delta. Here\r\nriver deposits rich in coal accumulated to a depth of sixteen\r\nthousand feet. The area of this coal field is estimated at about\r\nthirty-six thousand square miles.\r\n\r\nTHE APPALACHIAN REGION skirts the Appalachian oldland on the west\r\nfrom the southern boundary of New York to northern Alabama,\r\nextending west into eastern Ohio. The Cincinnati anticline was now\r\na peninsula, and the broad gulf which had lain between it and\r\nAppalachia was transformed at the beginning of the Pennsylvanian\r\ninto wide marshy plains, now sinking beneath the sea and now\r\nemerging from it. This area subsided during the Carboniferous\r\nperiod to a depth of nearly ten thousand feet.\r\n\r\nTHE CENTRAL REGION lay west of the peninsula of the Cincinnati\r\nanticline, and extended from Indiana west into eastern Nebraska,\r\nand from central Iowa and Illinois southward about the ancient\r\nisland in Missouri and Arkansas into Oklahoma and Texas. On the\r\nnorth the subsidence in this area was comparatively slight, for\r\nthe Carboniferous strata scarcely exceed two thousand feet in\r\nthickness. But in Arkansas and Indian Territory the downward\r\nmovement amounted to four and five miles, as is proved by shoal\r\nwater deposits of that immense thickness.\r\n\r\nThe coal fields of Indiana, and Illinois are now separated by\r\nerosion from those lying west of the Mississippi River. At the\r\nsouth the Appalachian land seems still to have stretched away to\r\nthe west across Louisiana and Mississippi into Texas, and this\r\nwestward extension formed the southern boundary of the coal\r\nmarshes of the continent.\r\n\r\nThe three regions just mentioned include the chief Carboniferous\r\ncoal fields of North America. Including a field in central\r\nMichigan evidently formed in an inclosed basin (Fig. 260), and one\r\nin Rhode Island, the total area of American coal fields has been\r\nreckoned at not less than two hundred thousand square miles. We\r\ncan hardly estimate the value of these great stores of fossil fuel\r\nto an industrial civilization. The forests of the coal swamps\r\naccumulated in their woody tissues the energy which they received\r\nfrom the sun in light and heat, and it is this solar energy long\r\nstored in coal seams which now forms the world's chief source of\r\npower in manufacturing.\r\n\r\nTHE WESTERN AREA. On the Great Plains beyond the Missouri River\r\nthe Carboniferous strata pass under those of more recent systems.\r\nWhere they reappear, as about dissected mountain axes or on\r\nstripped plateaus, they consist wholly of marine deposits and are\r\ndevoid of coal. The rich coal fields of the West are of later\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the Carboniferous seems to have been a time of\r\nsubsidence in the West. Throughout the period a sea covered the\r\nGreat Basin and the plateaus of the Colorado River. At the time of\r\nthe greatest depression the sites of the central chains of the\r\nRockies were probably islands, but early in the period they may\r\nhave been connected with the broad lands to the south and east.\r\nThousands of feet of Carboniferous sediments were deposited where\r\nthe Sierra Nevada Mountains now stand.\r\n\r\nTHE PERMIAN. As the Carboniferous period drew toward its close the\r\nsea gradually withdrew from the eastern part of the continent.\r\nWhere the sea lingered in the deepest troughs, and where inclosed\r\nbasins were cut off from it, the strata of the Permian were\r\ndeposited. Such are found in New Brunswick, in Pennsylvania and\r\nWest Virginia, in Texas, and in Kansas. In southwestern Kansas\r\nextensive Permian beds of rock salt and gypsum show that here lay\r\ngreat salt lakes in which these minerals were precipitated as\r\ntheir brines grew dense and dried away.\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere the Permian deposits are so\r\nextraordinary that they deserve a brief notice, although we have\r\nso far omitted mention of the great events which characterized the\r\nevolution of other continents than our own. The Permian fauna-\r\nflora of Australia, India, South Africa, and the southern part of\r\nSouth America are so similar that the inference is a reasonable\r\none that these widely separated regions were then connected\r\ntogether, probably as extensions of a great antarctic continent.\r\n\r\nInterbedded with the Permian strata of the first three countries\r\nnamed are extensive and thick deposits of a peculiar nature which\r\nare clearly ancient ground moraines. Clays and sand, now hardened\r\nto firm rock, are inset with unsorted stones of all sizes, which\r\noften are faceted and scratched. Moreover, these bowlder clays\r\nrest on rock pavements which are polished and scored with glacial\r\nmarkings. Hence toward the close of the Paleozoic the southern\r\nlands of the eastern hemisphere were invaded by great glaciers or\r\nperhaps by ice sheets like that which now shrouds Greenland.\r\n\r\nThese Permian ground moraines are not the first traces of the work\r\nof glaciers met with in the geological record. Similar deposits\r\nprove glaciation in Norway succeeding the pre-Cambrian stage of\r\nelevation, and Cambrian glacial drift has recently been found in\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nTHE APPALACHIAN DEFORMATION. We have seen that during Paleozoic\r\ntimes a long, narrow trough of the sea lay off the western coast\r\nof the ancient land of Appalachia, where now are the Appalachian\r\nMountains. During the long ages of this era the trough gradually\r\nsubsided, although with many stillstands and with occasional\r\nslight oscillations upward. Meanwhile the land lying to the east\r\nwas gradually uplifted at varying rates and with long pauses. The\r\nwaste of the rising land was constantly transferred to the sinking\r\nmarginal sea bottom, and on the whole the trough was filled with\r\nsediments as rapidly as it subsided. The sea was thus kept\r\nshallow, and at times, especially toward the close of the era,\r\nmuch of the area was upbuilt or raised to low, marshy, coastal\r\nplains. When the Carboniferous was ended the waste which had been\r\nremoved from the land and laid along its margin in the successive\r\nformations of the Paleozoic had reached a thickness of between\r\nthirty and forty thousand feet.\r\n\r\nBoth by sedimentation and by subsidence the trough had now become\r\na belt of weakness in the crust of the earth. Here the crust was\r\nnow made of layers to the depth of six or seven miles. In\r\ncomparison with the massive crystalline rocks of Appalachia on the\r\neast, the layered rock of the trough was weak to resist lateral\r\npressure, as a ream of sheets of paper is weak when compared with\r\na solid board of the same thickness. It was weaker also than the\r\nregion to the west, since there the sediments were much thinner.\r\nBesides, by the long-continued depression the strata of the trough\r\nhad been bent from the flat-lying attitude in which they were laid\r\nto one in which they were less able to resist a horizontal thrust.\r\n\r\nThere now occurred one of the critical stages in the history of\r\nthe planet, when the crust crumples under its own weight and\r\nshrinks down upon a nucleus which is diminishing in volume and no\r\nlonger able to support it. Under slow but resistless pressure the\r\nstrata of the Appalachian trough were thrust against the rigid\r\nland, and slowly, steadily bent into long folds whose axes ran\r\nnortheast-southwest parallel to the ancient coast line. It was on\r\nthe eastern side next the buttress of the land that the\r\ndeformation was the greatest, and the folds most steep and close.\r\nIn central Pennsylvania and West Virginia the folds were for the\r\nmost part open. South of these states the folds were more closely\r\nappressed, the strata were much broken, and the great thrust\r\nfaults were formed which have been described already. In eastern\r\nPennsylvania seams of bituminous coal were altered to anthracite,\r\nwhile outside the region of strong deformation, as in western\r\nPennyslvania, they remained unchanged. An important factor in the\r\ndeformation was the massive limestones of the Cambrian-Ordovician.\r\nBecause of these thick, resistant beds the rocks were bent into\r\nwide folds and sheared in places with great thrust faults. Had the\r\nstrata been weak shales, an equal pressure would have crushed and\r\nmashed them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the great earth folds were slowly raised, and no doubt\r\neroded in their rising, they formed in all probability a range of\r\nlofty mountains, with a width of from fifty to a hundred and\r\ntwenty-five miles, which stretched from New York to central\r\nAlabama.\r\n\r\nFrom their bases lowlands extended westward to beyond the Missouri\r\nRiver. At the same time ranges were upridged out of thick\r\nPaleozoic sediments both in the Bay of Fundy region and in the\r\nIndian Territory. The eastern portion of the North American\r\ncontinent was now well-nigh complete.\r\n\r\nThe date of the Appalachian deformation is told in the usual way.\r\nThe Carboniferous strata, nearly two miles thick, are all infolded\r\nin the Appalachian ridges, while the next deposits found in this\r\nregion--those of the later portion of the first period (the Trias)\r\nof the succeeding era--rest unconformably on the worn edges of the\r\nAppalachian folded strata. The deformation therefore took place\r\nabout the close of the Paleozoic. It seems to have begun in the\r\nPermian, in, eastern Pennsylvania,--for here the Permian strata\r\nare wanting,--and to have continued into the Trias, whose earlier\r\nformations are absent over all the area.\r\n\r\nWith this wide uplift the subsidence of the sea floor which had so\r\nlong been general in eastern North America came to an end.\r\nDeposition now gave place to erosion. The sedimentary record of\r\nthe Paleozoic was closed, and after an unknown lapse of time, here\r\nunrecorded, the annals of the succeeding era were written under\r\nchanged conditions.\r\n\r\nIn western North America the closing stages of the Paleozoic were\r\nmarked by important oscillations. The Great Basin, which had long\r\nbeen a mediterranean sea, was converted into land over western\r\nUtah and eastern Nevada, while the waves of the Pacific rolled\r\nacross California and western Nevada.\r\n\r\nThe absence of tuffs and lavas among the Carboniferous strata of\r\nNorth America shows that here volcanic action was singularly\r\nwanting during the entire period. Even the Appalachian deformation\r\nwas not accompanied by any volcanic outbursts.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THE CARBONIFEROUS\r\n\r\nPLANTS. The gloomy forests and dense undergrowths of the\r\nCarboniferous jungles would appear unfamiliar to us could we see\r\nthem as they grew, and even a botanist would find many of their\r\nforms perplexing and hard to classify. None of our modern trees\r\nwould meet the eye. Plants with conspicuous flowers of fragrance\r\nand beauty were yet to come. Even mosses and grasses were still\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nTree ferns lifted their crowns of feathery fronds high in air on\r\ntrunks of woody tissue; and lowly herbaceous ferns, some belonging\r\nto existing families, carpeted the ground. Many of the fernlike\r\nforms, however, have distinct affinities with the cycads, of which\r\nthey may be the ancestors, and some bear seeds and must be classed\r\nas gymnosperms.\r\n\r\nDense thickets, like cane or bamboo brakes, were composed of thick\r\nclumps of CALAMITES, whose slender, jointed stems shot up to a\r\nheight of forty feet, and at the joints bore slender branches set\r\nwith whorls of leaves. These were close allies of the Equiseta or\r\n\"horsetails,\" of the present; but they bore characteristics of\r\nhigher classes in the woody structures of their stems.\r\n\r\nThere were also vast monotonous forests, composed chiefly of trees\r\nbelonging to the lycopods, and whose nearest relatives to-day are\r\nthe little club mosses of our eastern woods. Two families of\r\nlycopods deserve special mention,--the Lepidodendrons and the\r\nSigillaria.\r\n\r\nThe LEPIDODENDRON, or \"scale tree,\" was a gigantic club moss fifty\r\nand seventy-five feet high, spreading toward the top into stout\r\nbranches, at whose ends were borne cone-shaped spore cases. The\r\nyounger parts of the tree were clothed with stiff needle-shaped\r\nleaves, but elsewhere the trunk and branches were marked with\r\nscalelike scars, left by the fallen leaves, and arranged in spiral\r\nrows.\r\n\r\nThe SIGILLARIA, or \"seal tree,\" was similar to the Lepidodendron,\r\nbut its fluted trunk divided into even fewer branches, and was\r\ndotted with vertical rows of leaf scars, like the impressions of a\r\nseal.\r\n\r\nBoth Lepidodendron and Sigillaria were anchored by means of great\r\ncablelike underground stems, which ran to long distances through\r\nthe marshy ground. The trunks of both trees had a thick woody\r\nrind, inclosing loose cellular tissue and a pith. Their hollow\r\nstumps, filled with sand and mud, are common in the Coal Measures,\r\nand in them one sometimes finds leaves and stems, land shells, and\r\nthe bones of little reptiles of the time which made their home\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that some of these gigantic lycopods,\r\nwhich are classed with the CRYPTOGAMS, or flowerless plants, had\r\npith and medullary rays dividing their cylinders into woody\r\nwedges. These characters connect them with the PHANEROGAMS, or\r\nflowering plants. Like so many of the organisms of the remote\r\npast, they were connecting types from which groups now widely\r\nseparated have diverged.\r\n\r\nGymnosperms, akin to the cycads, were also present in the\r\nCarboniferous forests. Such were the different species of\r\nCORDAITES, trees pyramidal in shape, with strap-shaped leaves and\r\nnutlike fruit. Other gymnosperms were related to the yews, and it\r\nwas by these that many of the fossil nuts found in the Coal\r\nMeasures were borne. It is thought by some that the gymnosperms\r\nhad their station on the drier plains and higher lands.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous jungles extended over parts of Europe and of\r\nAsia, as well as eastern North America, and reached from the\r\nequator to within nine degrees of the north pole. Even in these\r\nwidely separated regions the genera and species of coal plants are\r\nclose akin and often identical.\r\n\r\nINVERTEBRATES. Among the echinoderms, crinoids are now exceedingly\r\nabundant, sea urchins are more plentiful, and sea cucumbers are\r\nfound now for the first time. Trilobites are rapidly declining,\r\nand pass away forever with the close of the period. Eurypterids\r\nare common; stinging scorpions are abundant; and here occur the\r\nfirst-known spiders.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the arthropods were the first of all animals to\r\nconquer the realm of the air, the earliest insects appearing in\r\nthe Ordovician. Insects had now become exceedingly abundant, and\r\nthe Carboniferous forests swarmed with the ancestral types of\r\ndragon flies,--some with a spread of wing of more than two feet,--\r\nMay flies, crickets, and locusts. Cockroaches infested the swamps,\r\nand one hundred and thirty-three species of this ancient order\r\nhave been discovered in the Carboniferous of North America. The\r\nhigher flower-loving insects are still absent; the reign of the\r\nflowering plants has not yet begun. The Paleozoic insects were\r\ngeneralized types connecting the present orders. Their fore wings\r\nwere still membranous and delicately veined, and used in flying;\r\nthey had not yet become thick, and useful only as wing covers, as\r\nin many of their descendants.\r\n\r\nFISHES still held to the Devonian types, with the exception that\r\nthe strange ostracoderms now had perished.\r\n\r\nAMPHIBIANS. The vertebrates had now followed the arthropods and\r\nthe mollusks upon the land, and had evolved a higher type adapted\r\nto the new environment. Amphibians--the class to which frogs and\r\nsalamanders belong--now appear, with lungs for breathing air and\r\nwith limbs for locomotion on the land. Most of the Carboniferous\r\namphibians were shaped like the salamander, with weak limbs\r\nadapted more for crawling than for carrying the body well above\r\nthe ground. Some legless, degenerate forms were snakelike in\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nThe earliest amphibians differ from those of to-day in a number of\r\nrespects. They were connecting types linking together fishes, from\r\nwhich they were descended, with reptiles, of which they were the\r\nancestors. They retained the evidence of their close relationship\r\nwith the Devonian fishes in their cold blood, their gills and\r\naquatic habit during their larval stage, their teeth with dentine\r\ninfolded like those of the Devonian ganoids but still more\r\nintricately, and their biconcave vertebrae which never completely\r\nossified. These, the highest vertebrates of the time, had not yet\r\nadvanced beyond the embryonic stage of the more or less\r\ncartilaginous skeleton and the persistent notochord.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the skull of the Carboniferous amphibians was\r\nmade of close-set bony plates, like the skull of the reptile,\r\nrather than like that of the frog, with its open spaces (Figs. 313\r\nand 314). Unlike modern amphibians, with their slimy skin, the\r\nCarboniferous amphibians wore an armor of bony scales over the\r\nventral surface and sometimes over the back as well.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice from the footprints and skeletons of\r\nthese earliest-known vertebrates of the land what was the\r\nprimitive number of digits. The Carboniferous amphibians had five-\r\ntoed feet, the primitive type of foot, from which their\r\ndescendants of higher orders, with a smaller number of digits,\r\nhave diverged.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous was the age of lycopods and amphibians, as the\r\nDevonian had been the age of rhizocarps and fishes.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THE PERMIAN. The close of the Paleozoic was, as we have\r\nseen, a time of marked physical changes. The upridging of the\r\nAppalachians had begun and a wide continental uplift--proved by\r\nthe absence of Permian deposits over large areas where\r\nsedimentation had gone on before--opened new lands for settlement\r\nto hordes of air-breathing animals. Changes of climate compelled\r\nextensive migrations, and the fauna of different regions were thus\r\nbrought into conflict. The Permian was a time of pronounced\r\nchanges in plant and animal life, and a transitional period\r\nbetween two great eras. The somber forests of the earlier\r\nCarboniferous, with their gigantic club mosses, were now replaced\r\nby forests of cycads, tree ferns, and conifers. Even in the lower\r\nPermian the Lepidodendron and Sigillaria were very rare, and\r\nbefore the end of the epoch they and the Calamites also had become\r\nextinct. Gradually the antique types of the Paleozoic fauna died\r\nout, and in the Permian rocks are found the last survivors of the\r\ncystoid, the trilobite, and the eurypterid, and of many long-lived\r\nfamilies of brachiopods, mollusks, and other invertebrates. The\r\nvenerable Orthoceras and the Goniatite linger on through the epoch\r\nand into the first period of the succeeding era. Forerunners of\r\nthe great ammonite family of cephalopod mollusks now appear. The\r\nantique forms of the earlier Carboniferous amphibians continue,\r\nbut with many new genera and a marked increase in size.\r\n\r\nA long forward step had now been taken in the evolution of the\r\nvertebrates. A new and higher type, the reptiles, had appeared,\r\nand in such numbers and variety are they found in the Permian\r\nstrata that their advent may well have occurred in a still earlier\r\nepoch. It will be most convenient to describe the Permian reptiles\r\nalong with their descendants of the Mesozoic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE MESOZOIC\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the close of the Permian the world of animal and vegetable\r\nlife had so changed that the line is drawn here which marks the\r\nend of the old order and the beginning of the new and separates\r\nthe Paleozoic from the succeeding era,--the Mesozoic, the Middle\r\nAge of geological history. Although the Mesozoic era is shorter\r\nthan the Paleozoic, as measured by the thickness of their strata,\r\nyet its duration must be reckoned in millions of years. Its\r\npredominant life features are the culmination and the beginning of\r\nthe decline of reptiles, amphibians, cephalopod mollusks, and\r\ncycads, and the advent of marsupial mammals, birds, teleost\r\nfishes, and angiospermous plants. The leading events of the long\r\nages of the era we can sketch only in the most summary way.\r\n\r\nThe Mesozoic comprises three systems,--the TRIASSIC, named from\r\nits threefold division in Germany; the JURASSIC, which is well\r\ndisplayed in the Jura Mountains; and the CRETACEOUS, which\r\ncontains the extensive chalk (Latin, creta) deposits of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn eastern North America the Mesozoic rocks are much less\r\nimportant than the Paleozoic, for much of this portion of the\r\ncontinent was land during the Mesozoic era, and the area of the\r\nMesozoic rocks is small. In western North America, on the other\r\nhand, the strata of the Mesozoic--and of the Cenozoic also--are\r\nwidely spread. The Paleozoic rocks are buried quite generally from\r\nview except where the mountain makings and continental uplifts of\r\nthe Mesozoic and Cenozoic have allowed profound erosion to bring\r\nthem to light, as in deep canyons and about mountain axes. The\r\nrecord of many of the most important events in the development of\r\nthe continent during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras is found in\r\nthe rocks of our western states.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIASSIC AND JURASSIC\r\n\r\nEASTERN NORTH AMERICA. The sedimentary record interrupted by the\r\nAppalachian deformation was not renewed in eastern North America\r\nuntil late in the Triassic. Hence during this long interval the\r\nland stood high, the coast was farther out than now, and over our\r\nAtlantic states geological time was recorded chiefly in erosion\r\nforms of hill and plain which have long since vanished. The area\r\nof the later Triassic rocks of this region, which take up again\r\nthe geological record, is seen in the map of Figure 260. They lie\r\non the upturned and eroded edges of the older rocks and occupy\r\nlong troughs running for the most part parallel to the Atlantic\r\ncoast. Evidently subsidence was in progress where these rocks were\r\ndeposited. The eastern border of Appalachia was now depressed. The\r\noldland was warping, and long belts of country lying parallel to\r\nthe shore subsided, forming troughs in which thousands of feet of\r\nsediment now gathered.\r\n\r\nThese Triassic rocks, which are chiefly sandstones, hold no marine\r\nfossils, and hence were not laid in open arms of the sea. But\r\ntheir layers are often ripple-marked, and contain many tracks of\r\nreptiles, imprints of raindrops, and some fossil wood, while an\r\noccasional bed of shale is filled with the remains of fishes. We\r\nmay conceive, then, of the Connecticut valley and the larger\r\ntrough to the southwest as basins gradually sinking at a rate\r\nperhaps no faster than that of the New Jersey coast to-day, and as\r\ngradually aggraded by streams from the neighboring uplands. Their\r\nbroad, sandy flats were overflowed by wandering streams, and when\r\nsubsidence gained on deposition shallow lakes overspread the\r\nalluvial plains. Perhaps now and then the basins became long,\r\nbrackish estuaries, whose low shores were swept by the incoming\r\ntide and were in turn left bare at its retreat to receive the rain\r\nprints of passing showers and the tracks of the troops of reptiles\r\nwhich inhabited these valleys.\r\n\r\nThe Triassic rocks are mainly red sandstones,--often feldspathic,\r\nor arkose, with some conglomerates and shales. Considering the\r\nlarge amount of feldspathic material in these rocks, do you infer\r\nthat they were derived from the adjacent crystalline and\r\nmetamorphic rocks of the oldland of Appalachia, or from the\r\nsedimentary Paleozoic rocks which had been folded into mountains\r\nduring the Appalachian deformation? If from the former, was the\r\ndrainage of the northern Appalachian mountain region then, as now,\r\neastward and southeastward toward the Atlantic? The Triassic\r\nsandstones are voluminous, measuring at least a mile in thickness,\r\nand are largely of coarse waste. What do you infer as to the\r\nheight of the lands from which the waste was shed, or the\r\ndirection of the oscillation which they were then undergoing? In\r\nthe southern basins, as about Richmond, Virginia, are valuable\r\nbeds of coal; what was the physical geography of these areas when\r\nthe coal was being formed?\r\n\r\nInterbedded with the Triassic sandstones are contemporaneous lava\r\nbeds which were fed from dikes. Volcanic action, which had been\r\nremarkably absent in eastern North America during Paleozoic times,\r\nwas well-marked in connection with the warping now in progress.\r\nThick intrusive sheets have also been driven in among the strata,\r\nas, for example, the sheet of the Palisades of the Hudson,\r\ndescribed on page 269.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the Triassic sandstones of the\r\nConnecticut valley is seen in Figure 315. Were the beds laid in\r\ntheir present attitude? What was the nature of the deformation\r\nwhich they have suffered? When did the intrusion of lava sheets\r\ntake place relative to the deformation? What effect have these\r\nsheets on the present topography, and why? Assuming that the\r\nTriassic deformation went on more rapidly than denudation, what\r\nwas its effect on the topography of the time? Are there any of its\r\nresults remaining in the topography of to-day? Do the Triassic\r\nareas now stand higher or lower than the surrounding country, and\r\nwhy? How do the Triassic sandstones and shales compare in hardness\r\nwith the igneous and metamorphic rocks about them? The Jurassic\r\nstrata are wanting over the Triassic areas and over all of eastern\r\nNorth America. Was this region land or sea, an area of erosion or\r\nsedimentation, during the Jurassic period? In New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, and farther southwest the lowest strata of the next\r\nperiod, the Cretaceous, rest on the eroded edges of the earlier\r\nrocks. The surface on which they lie is worn so even that we must\r\nbelieve that at the opening of the Cretaceous the oldland of\r\nAppalachia, including the Triassic areas, had been baseleveled at\r\nleast near the coast. When, therefore, did the deformation of the\r\nTriassic rocks occur?\r\n\r\nWESTERN NORTH AMERICA. Triassic strata infolded in the Sierra\r\nNevada Mountains carry marine fossils and reach a thickness of\r\nnearly five thousand feet. California was then under water, and\r\nthe site of the Sierra was a subsiding trough slowly filling with\r\nwaste from the Great Basin land to the east.\r\n\r\nOver a long belt which reaches from Wyoming across Colorado into\r\nNew Mexico no Triassic sediments are found, nor is there any\r\nevidence that they were ever present; hence this area was high\r\nland suffering erosion during the Triassic. On each side of it, in\r\neastern Colorado and about the Black Hills, in western Texas, in\r\nUtah, over the site of the Wasatch Mountains, and southward into\r\nArizona over the plateaus trenched by the Colorado River, are\r\nlarge areas of Triassic rocks, sandstones chiefly, with some rock\r\nsalt and gypsum. Fossils are very rare and none of them marine.\r\nHere, then, lay broad shallow lakes often salt, and warped basins,\r\nin which the waste of the adjacent uplands gathered. To this\r\nsystem belong the sandstones of the Garden of the Gods in\r\nColorado, which later earth movements have upturned with the\r\nuplifted mountain flanks.\r\n\r\nThe Jurassic was marked with varied oscillations and wide changes\r\nin the outline of sea and land.\r\n\r\nJurassic shales of immense thickness--now metamorphosed into\r\nslates--are found infolded into the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Hence\r\nduring Jurassic times the Sierra trough continued to subside, and\r\nenormous deposits of mud were washed into it from the land lying\r\nto the east. Contemporaneous lava flows interbedded with the\r\nstrata show that volcanic action accompanied the downwarp, and\r\nthat molten rock was driven upward through fissures in the crust\r\nand outspread over the sea floor in sheets of lava.\r\n\r\nTHE SIERRA DEFORMATION. Ever since the middle of the Silurian, the\r\nSierra trough had been sinking, though no doubt with halts and\r\ninterruptions, until it contained nearly twenty-five thousand feet\r\nof sediment. At the close of the Jurassic it yielded to lateral\r\npressure and the vast pile of strata was crumpled and upheaved\r\ninto towering mountains. The Mesozoic muds were hardened and\r\nsqueezed into slates. The rocks were wrenched and broken, and\r\nunderground waters began the work of filling their fissures with\r\ngold-bearing quartz, which was yet to wait millions of years\r\nbefore the arrival of man to mine it. Immense bodies of molten\r\nrock were intruded into the crust as it suffered deformation, and\r\nthese appear in the large areas of granite which the later\r\ndenudation of the range has brought to light.\r\n\r\nThe same movements probably uplifted the rocks of the Coast Range\r\nin a chain of islands. The whole western part of the continent was\r\nraised and its seas and lakes were for the most part drained away.\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH ISLES. The Triassic strata of the British Isles are\r\ncontinental, and include breccia beds of cemented talus, deposits\r\nof salt and gypsum, and sandstones whose rounded and polished\r\ngrains are those of the wind-blown sands of deserts. In Triassic\r\ntimes the British Isles were part of a desert extending over much\r\nof northwestern Europe.\r\n\r\nTHE CRETACEOUS\r\n\r\nThe third great system of the Mesozoic includes many formations,\r\nmarine and continental, which record a long and complicated\r\nhistory marked by great oscillations of the crust and wide changes\r\nin the outlines of sea and land.\r\n\r\nEARLY CRETACEOUS. In eastern North America the lowest Cretaceous\r\nseries comprises fresh-water formations which are traced from\r\nNantucket across Martha's Vineyard and Long Island, and through\r\nNew Jersey southward into Georgia. They rest unconformably on the\r\nTriassic sandstones and the older rocks of the region. The\r\nAtlantic shore line was still farther out than now in the northern\r\nstates. Again, as during the Triassic, a warping of the crust\r\nformed a long trough parallel to the coast and to the Appalachian\r\nridges, but cut off from the sea; and here the continental\r\ndeposits of the early Cretaceous were laid.\r\n\r\nAlong the Gulf of Mexico the same series was deposited under like\r\nconditions over the area known as the Mississippi embayment,\r\nreaching from Georgia northwestward into Tennessee and thence\r\nacross into Arkansas and southward into Texas.\r\n\r\nIn the Southwest the subsidence continued until the transgressing\r\nsea covered most of Mexico and Texas and extended a gulf northward\r\ninto Kansas. In its warm and quiet waters limestones accumulated\r\nto a depth of from one thousand to five thousand feet in Texas,\r\nand of more than ten thousand feet in Mexico. Meanwhile the\r\nlowlands, where the Great Plains are now, received continental\r\ndeposits; coal swamps stretched from western Montana into British\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nTHE MIDDLE CRETACEOUS. This was a land epoch. The early Cretaceous\r\nsea retired from Texas and Mexico, for its sediments are overlain\r\nunconformably by formations of the Upper Cretaceous. So long was\r\nthe time gap between the two series that no species found in the\r\none occurs in the other.\r\n\r\nTHE UPPER CRETACEOUS. There now began one of the most remarkable\r\nevents in all geological history,--the great Cretaceous\r\nsubsidence. Its earlier warpings were recorded in continental\r\ndeposits,--wide sheets of sandstone, shale, and some coal,--which\r\nwere spread from Texas to British Columbia. These continental\r\ndeposits are overlain by a succession of marine formations whose\r\nvast area is shown on the map, Figure 260. We may infer that as\r\nthe depression of the continent continued the sea came in far and\r\nwide over the coast lands and the plains worn low during the\r\nprevious epochs. Upper Cretaceous formations show that south of\r\nNew England the waters of the Atlantic somewhat overlapped the\r\ncrystalline rocks of the Piedmont Belt and spread their waste over\r\nthe submerged coastal plain. The Gulf of Mexico again covered the\r\nMississippi embayment, reaching as far north as southern Illinois,\r\nand extended over Texas.\r\n\r\nA mediterranean sea now stretched from the Gulf to the arctic\r\nregions and from central Iowa to the eastern shore of the Great\r\nBasin land at about the longitude of Salt Lake City, the Colorado\r\nMountains rising from it in a chain of islands. Along with minor\r\noscillations there were laid in the interior sea various\r\nformations of sandstones, shales, and limestones, and from Kansas\r\nto South Dakota beds of white chalk show that the clear, warm\r\nwaters swarmed at times with foraminiferal life whose\r\ndisintegrating microscopic shells accumulated in this rare\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\nAt this epoch a wide sea, interrupted by various islands,\r\nstretched across Eurasia from Wales and western Spain to China,\r\nand spread southward over much of the Sahara. To the west its\r\nwaters were clear and on its floor the crumbled remains of\r\nforaminifers gathered in heavy accumulations of calcareous ooze,--\r\nthe white chalk of France and England. Sea urchins were also\r\nabundant, and sponges contributed their spicules to form nodules\r\nof flint.\r\n\r\nTHE LARAMIE. The closing stage of the Cretaceous was marked in\r\nNorth America by a slow uplift of the land. As the interior sea\r\ngradually withdrew, the warping basins of its floor were filled\r\nwith waste from the rising lands about them, and over this wide\r\narea there were spread continental deposits in fresh-water lakes\r\nlike the Great Lakes of the present, in brackish estuaries, and in\r\nriver plains, while occasional oscillations now and again let in\r\nthe sea. There were vast marshes in which there accumulated the\r\nlarger part of the valuable coal seams of the West. The Laramie is\r\nthe coal-bearing series of the West, as the Pennsylvanian is of\r\nthe eastern part of our country.\r\n\r\nTHE ROCKY MOUNTAIN DEFORMATION. At the close of the Cretaceous we\r\nenter upon an epoch of mountain-making far more extensive than any\r\nwhich the continent had witnessed. The long belt lying west of the\r\nancient axes of the Colorado Islands and east of the Great Basin\r\nland had been an area of deposition for many ages, and in its\r\nsubsiding troughs Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments had gathered to\r\nthe depth of many thousand feet. And now from Mexico well-nigh to\r\nthe Arctic Ocean this belt yielded to lateral pressure. The\r\nCretaceous limestones of Mexico were folded into lofty mountains.\r\nA massive range was upfolded where the Wasatch Mountains now are,\r\nand various ranges of the Rockies in Colorado and other states\r\nwere upridged. However slowly these deformations were effected\r\nthey were no doubt accompanied by world-shaking earthquakes, and\r\nit is known that volcanic eruptions took place on a magnificent\r\nscale. Outflows of lava occurred along the Wasatch, the laccoliths\r\nof the Henry Mountains were formed, while the great masses of\r\nigneous rock which constitute the cores of the Spanish Peaks and\r\nother western mountains were thrust up amid the strata. The high\r\nplateaus from which many of these ranges rise had not yet been\r\nuplifted, and the bases of the mountains probably stood near the\r\nlevel of the sea.\r\n\r\nNorth America was now well-nigh completed. The mediterranean seas\r\nwhich so often had occupied the heart of the land were done away\r\nwith, and the continent stretched unbroken from the foot of the\r\nSierras on the west to the Fall Line of the Atlantic coastal plain\r\non the east.\r\n\r\nTHE MESOZOIC PENEPLAIN. The immense thickness of the Mesozoic\r\nformations conveys to our minds some idea of the vast length of\r\ntime involved in the slow progress of its successive ages. The\r\nsame lesson is taught as plainly by the amount of denudation which\r\nthe lands suffered during the era.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the Mesozoic saw a system of lofty mountain\r\nranges stretching from New York into central Alabama. The end of\r\nthis long era found here a wide peneplain crossed by sluggish\r\nwandering rivers and overlooked by detached hills as yet unreduced\r\nto the general level. The Mesozoic era was long enough for the\r\nAppalachian Mountains, upridged at its beginning, to have been\r\nweathered and worn away and carried grain by grain to the sea. The\r\nsame plain extended over southern New England. The Taconic range,\r\nuplifted partially at least at the close of the Ordovician, and\r\nthe block mountains of the Triassic, together with the pre-\r\nCambrian mountains of ancient Appalachia, had now all been worn to\r\na common level with the Allegheny ranges. The Mesozoic peneplain\r\nhas been upwarped by later crustal movements and has suffered\r\nprofound erosion, but the remnants of it which remain on the\r\nupland of southern New England and the even summits of the\r\nAllegheny ridges suffice to prove that it once existed. The age of\r\nthe Mesozoic peneplain is determined from the fact that the lower\r\nTertiary sediments were deposited on its even surface when at the\r\nclose of the era the peneplain was depressed along its edges\r\nbeneath the sea.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THE MESOZOIC\r\n\r\nPLANT LIFE OF THE TRIASSIC AND JURASSIC. The Carboniferous forests\r\nof lepidodendrons and sigillafids had now vanished from the earth.\r\nThe uplands were clothed with conifers, like the Araucarian pines\r\nof South America and Australia. Dense forests of tree ferns throve\r\nin moist regions, and canebrakes of horsetails of modern type, but\r\nwith stems reaching four inches in thickness, bordered the lagoons\r\nand marshes. Cycads were exceedingly abundant. These gymnosperms,\r\nrelated to the pines and spruces in structure and fruiting, but\r\npalmlike in their foliage, and uncoiling their long leaves after\r\nthe manner of ferns, culminated in the Jurassic. From the view\r\npoint of the botanist the Mesozoic is the Age of Cycads, and after\r\nthis era they gradually decline to the small number of species now\r\nexisting in tropical latitudes.\r\n\r\nPLANT LIFE OF THE CRETACEOUS. In the Lower Cretaceous the\r\nwoodlands continued of much the same type as during the Jurassic.\r\nThe forerunners now appeared of the modern dicotyls (plants with\r\ntwo seed leaves), and in the Middle Cretaceous the\r\nmonocotyledonous group of palms came in. Palms are so like cycads\r\nthat we may regard them as the descendants of some cycad type.\r\n\r\nIn the UPPER CRETACEOUS, cycads become rare. The highest types of\r\nflowering plants gain a complete ascendency, and forests of modern\r\naspect cover the continent from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic\r\nOcean. Among the kinds of forest trees whose remains are found in\r\nthe continental deposits of the Cretaceous are the magnolia, the\r\nmyrtle, the laurel, the fig, the tulip tree, the chestnut, the\r\noak, beech, elm, poplar, willow, birch, and maple. Forests of\r\nEucalyptus grew along the coast of New England, and palms on the\r\nPacific shores of British Columbia. Sequoias of many varieties\r\nranged far into northern Canada. In northern Greenland there were\r\nluxuriant forests of magnolias, figs, and cycads; and a similar\r\nflora has been disinterred from the Cretaceous rocks of Alaska and\r\nSpitzbergen. Evidently the lands within the Arctic Circle enjoyed\r\na warm and genial climate, as they had done during the Paleozoic.\r\nGreenland had the temperature of Cuba and southern Florida, and\r\nthe time was yet far distant when it was to be wrapped in glacier\r\nice.\r\n\r\nINVERTEBRATES. During the long succession of the ages of the\r\nMesozoic, with their vast geographical changes, there were many\r\nand great changes in organisms. Species were replaced again and\r\nagain by others better fitted to the changing environment. During\r\nthe Lower Cretaceous alone there were no less than six successive\r\nchanges in the faunas which inhabited the limestone-making sea\r\nwhich then covered Texas. We shall disregard these changes for the\r\nmost part in describing the life of the era, and shall confine our\r\nview to some of the most important advances made in the leading\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\nStromatopora have disappeared. Protozoans and sponges are\r\nexceedingly abundant, and all contribute to the making of Mesozoic\r\nstrata. Corals have assumed a more modern type. Sea urchins have\r\nbecome plentiful; crinoids abound until the Cretaceous, where they\r\nbegin their decline to their present humble station.\r\n\r\nTrilobites and eurypterids are gone. Ten-footed crustaceans abound\r\nof the primitive long-tailed type (represented by the lobster and\r\nthe crayfish), and in the Jurassic there appears the modern short-\r\ntailed type represented by the crabs. The latter type is higher in\r\norganization and now far more common. In its embryological\r\ndevelopment it passes through the long-tailed stage; connecting\r\nlinks in the Mesozoic also indicate that the younger type is the\r\noffshoot of the older.\r\n\r\nInsects evolve along diverse lines, giving rise to beetles, ants,\r\nbees, and flies.\r\n\r\nBrachiopods have dwindled greatly in the number of their species,\r\nwhile mollusks have correspondingly increased. The great oyster\r\nfamily dates from here.\r\n\r\nCephalopods are now to have their day. The archaic Orthoceras\r\nlingers on into the Triassic and becomes extinct, but a remarkable\r\ndevelopment is now at hand for the more highly organized\r\ndescendants of this ancient line. We have noticed that in the\r\nDevonian the sutures of some of the chambered shells become\r\nangled, evolving the Goniatite type. The sutures now become lobed\r\nand corrugated in Ceratites. The process was carried still\r\nfarther, and the sutures were elaborately frilled in the great\r\norder of the Ammonites. It was in the Jurassic that the Ammonites\r\nreached their height. No fossils are more abundant or\r\ncharacteristic of their age. Great banks of their shells formed\r\nbeds of limestone in warm seas the world over.\r\n\r\nThe ammonite stem branched into a most luxuriant variety of forms.\r\nThe typical form was closely coiled like a nautilus. In others the\r\ncoil was more or less open, or even erected into a spiral. Some\r\nwere hook-shaped, and there were members of the order in which the\r\nshell was straight, and yet retained all the internal structures\r\nof its kind. At the end of the Mesozoic the entire tribe of\r\nammonites became extinct.\r\n\r\nThe Belemnite (Greek, belemnon, a dart) is a distinctly higher\r\ntype of cephalopod which appeared in the Triassic, became numerous\r\nand varied in the Jurassic and Cretaceous, and died out early in\r\nthe Tertiary. Like the squids and cuttlefish, of which it was the\r\nprototype, it had an internal calcareous shell. This consisted of\r\na chambered and siphuncled cone, whose point was sheathed in a\r\nlong solid guard somewhat like a dart. The animal carried an ink\r\nsac, and no doubt used it as that of the modern cuttlefish is\r\nused,--to darken the water and make easy an escape from foes.\r\nBelemnites have sometimes been sketched with fossil sepia, or\r\nindia ink, from their own ink sacs. In the belemnites and their\r\ndescendants, the squids and cuttlefish, the cephalopods made the\r\nradical change from external to the internal shell. They abandoned\r\nthe defensive system of warfare and boldly took up the offensive.\r\nNo doubt, like their descendants, the belemnites were exceedingly\r\nactive and voracious creatures.\r\n\r\nFISHES AND AMPHIBIANS. In the Triassic and Jurassic, little\r\nprogress was made among the fishes, and the ganoid was still the\r\nleading type. In the Cretaceous the teleosts, or bony fishes, made\r\ntheir appearance, while ganoids declined toward their present\r\nsubordinate place.\r\n\r\nThe amphibians culminated in the Triassic, some being formidable\r\ncreatures as large as alligators. They were still of the primitive\r\nPaleozoic types. Their pygmy descendants of more modern types are\r\nnot found until later, salamanders appearing first in the\r\nCretaceous, and frogs at the beginning of the Cenozoic.\r\n\r\nNo remains of amphibians have been discovered in the Jurassic. Do\r\nyou infer from this that there were none in existence at that\r\ntime?\r\n\r\nREPTILES OF THE MESOZOIC\r\n\r\nThe great order of Reptiles made its advent in the Permian,\r\nculminated in the Triassic and Jurassic, and began to decline in\r\nthe Cretaceous. The advance from the amphibian to the reptile was\r\na long forward step in the evolution of the vertebrates. In the\r\nreptile the vertebrate skeleton now became completely ossified.\r\nGills were abandoned and breathing was by lungs alone. The\r\ndevelopment of the individual from the egg to maturity was\r\nuninterrupted by any metamorphosis, such as that of the frog when\r\nit passes from the tadpole stage. Yet in advancing from the\r\namphibian to the reptile the evolution of the vertebrate was far\r\nfrom finished. The cold-blooded, clumsy and sluggish, small-\r\nbrained and unintelligent reptile is as far inferior to the higher\r\nmammals, whose day was still to come, as it is superior to the\r\namphibian and the fish.\r\n\r\nThe reptiles of the Permian, the earliest known, were much like\r\nlizards in form of body. Constituting a transition type between\r\nthe amphibians on the one hand, and both the higher reptiles and\r\nthe mammals on the other, they retained the archaic biconcave\r\nvertebra of the fish and in some cases the persistent notochord,\r\nwhile some of them, the theromorphs, possessed characters allying\r\nthem with mammals. In these the skull was remarkably similar to\r\nthat of the carnivores, or flesh-eating mammals, and the teeth,\r\nunlike the teeth of any later reptiles, were divisible into\r\nincisors, canines, and molars, as are the teeth of mammals.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the Mesozoic era reptiles were the most highly\r\norganized and powerful of any animals on the earth. New ranges of\r\ncontinental extent were opened to them, food was abundant, the\r\nclimate was congenial, and they now branched into very many\r\ndiverse types which occupied and ruled all fields,--the land, the\r\nair, and the sea. The Mesozoic was the Age of Reptiles.\r\n\r\nTHE ANCESTRY OF SURVIVING REPTILIAN TYPES. We will consider first\r\nthe evolution of the few reptilian types which have survived to\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\nCrocodiles, the highest of existing reptiles, are a very ancient\r\norder, dating back to the lower Jurassic, and traceable to earlier\r\nancestral, generalized forms, from which sprang several other\r\norders also.\r\n\r\nTurtles and tortoises are not found until the early Jurassic, when\r\nthey already possessed the peculiar characteristics which set them\r\noff so sharply from other reptiles. They seem to have lived at\r\nfirst in shallow water and in swamps, and it is not until after\r\nthe end of the Mesozoic that some of the order became adapted to\r\nlife on the land.\r\n\r\nThe largest of all known turtles, Archelon, whose home was the\r\ngreat interior Cretaceous sea, was fully a dozen feet in length\r\nand must have weighed at least two tons. The skull alone is a yard\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nLizards and snakes do not appear until after the close of the\r\nMesozoic, although their ancestral lines may be followed back into\r\nthe Cretaceous.\r\n\r\nWe will now describe some of the highly specialized orders\r\npeculiar to the Mesozoic.\r\n\r\nLAND REPTILES. The DINOSAURS (terrible reptiles) are an extremely\r\nvaried order which were masters of the land from the late Trias\r\nuntil the close of the Mesozoic era. Some were far larger than\r\nelephants, some were as small as cats; some walked on all fours,\r\nsome were bipedal; some fed on the luxuriant tropical foliage, and\r\nothers on the flesh of weaker reptiles. They may be classed in\r\nthree divisions,--the FLESH-EATING DINOSAURS, the REPTILE-FOOTED\r\nDINOSAURS, and the BEAKED DINOSAURS,--the latter two divisions\r\nbeing herbivorous.\r\n\r\nThe FLESH-EATING DINOSAURS are the oldest known division of the\r\norder, and their characteristics are shown in Figure 329. As a\r\nclass, reptiles are egg layers (oviparous); but some of the flesh-\r\neating dinosaurs are known to have been VIVIPAROUS, i.e. to have\r\nbrought forth their young alive. This group was the longest-lived\r\nof any of the three, beginning in the Trias and continuing to the\r\nclose of the Mesozoic era.\r\n\r\nContrast the small fore limbs, used only for grasping, with the\r\npowerful hind limbs on which the animal stalked about. Some of the\r\nspecies of this group seem to have been able to progress by\r\nleaping in kangaroo fashion. Notice the sharp claws, the ponderous\r\ntail, and the skull set at right angles with the spinal column.\r\nThe limb bones are hollow. The ceratosaurs reached a length of\r\nsome fifteen feet, and were not uncommon in Colorado and the\r\nwestern lands in Jurassic times.\r\n\r\nThe REPTILE-FOOTED DINOSAURS (Sauropoda) include some of the\r\nbiggest brutes which ever trod the ground. One of the largest,\r\nwhose remains are found entombed in the Jurassic rocks of Wyoming\r\nand Colorado, is shown in Figure 330.\r\n\r\nNote the five digits on the hind feet, the quadrupedal gait, the\r\nenormous stretch of neck and tail, the small head aligned with the\r\nvertebral column. Diplodocus was fully sixty-five feet long and\r\nmust have weighed about twenty tons. The thigh bones of the\r\nSauropoda are the largest bones which ever grew. That of a genus\r\nallied to the Diplodocus measures six feet and eight inches, and\r\nthe total length of the animal must have been not far from eighty\r\nfeet, the largest land animal known.\r\n\r\nThe Sauropoda became extinct when their haunts along the rivers\r\nand lakes of the western plains of Jurassic times were invaded by\r\nthe Cretaceous interior sea.\r\n\r\nThe BEAKED DINOSAURS(Predentata) were distinguished by a beak\r\nsheathed with horn carried in front of the tooth-set jaw, and\r\nused, we may imagine, in stripping the leaves and twigs of trees\r\nand shrubs. We may notice only two of the most interesting types.\r\n\r\nSTEGOSAURUS (plated reptile) takes its name from the double row of\r\nbony plates arranged along its back. The powerful tail was armed\r\nwith long spines, and the thick skin was defended with irregular\r\nbits of bone implanted in it. The brain of the stegosaur was\r\nsmaller than that of any land vertebrate, while in the sacrum the\r\nnerve canal was enlarged to ten times the capacity of the brain\r\ncavity of the skull. Despite their feeble wits, this well-armored\r\nfamily lived on through millions of years which intervened between\r\ntheir appearance, at the opening of the Jurassic, and the close of\r\nthe Cretaceous, when they became extinct.\r\n\r\nA less stupid brute than the stegosaur was TRICERATOPS, the\r\ndinosaur of the three horns,--one horn carried on the nose, and a\r\nmassive pair set over the eyes. Note the enormous wedge-shaped\r\nskull, with its sharp beak, and the hood behind resembling a\r\nfireman's helmet. Triceratops was fully twenty-five feet long, and\r\nof twice the bulk of an elephant. The family appeared in the Upper\r\nCretaceous and became extinct at its close. Their bones are found\r\nburied in the fresh-water deposits of the time from Colorado to\r\nMontana and eastward to the Dakotas.\r\n\r\nMARINE REPTILES. In the ocean, reptiles occupied the place now\r\nheld by the aquatic mammals, such as whales and dolphins, and\r\ntheir form and structure were similarly modified to suit their\r\nenvironment. In the Ichthyosaurus (fish reptile), for example, the\r\nbody was fishlike in form, with short neck and large, pointed head\r\n(Fig. 333).\r\n\r\nA powerful tail, whose flukes were set vertical, and the lower one\r\nof which was vertebrated, served as propeller, while a large\r\ndorsal fin was developed as a cutwater. The primitive biconcave\r\nvertebrae of the fish and of the early land vertebrates were\r\nretained, and the limbs degenerated into short paddles. The skin\r\nof the ichthyosaur was smooth like that of a whale, and its food\r\nwas largely fish and cephalopods, as the fossil contents of its\r\nstomach prove.\r\n\r\nThese sea monsters disported along the Pacific shore over northern\r\nCalifornia in Triassic times, and the bones of immense members of\r\nthe family occur in the Jurassic strata of Wyoming. Like whales\r\nand seals, the ichthyosaurs were descended from land vertebrates\r\nwhich had become adapted to a marine habitat.\r\n\r\nPLESIOSAURS were another order which ranged throughout the\r\nMesozoic. Descended from small amphibious animals, they later\r\nincluded great marine reptiles, characterized in the typical genus\r\nby long neck, snakelike head, and immense paddles. They swam in\r\nthe Cretaceous interior sea of western North America.\r\n\r\nMOSASAURS belong to the same order as do snakes and lizards, and\r\nare an offshoot of the same ancestral line of land reptiles. These\r\nsnakelike creatures--which measured as much as forty-five feet in\r\nlength--abounded in the Cretaceous seas. They had large conical\r\nteeth, and their limbs had become stout paddles.\r\n\r\nThe lower jaw of the mosasaur was jointed; the quadrate bone,\r\nwhich in all reptiles connects the bone of the lower jaw with the\r\nskull, was movable, and as in snakes the lower jaw could be used\r\nin thrusting prey down the throat. The family became extinct at\r\nthe end of the Mesozoic, and left no descendants. One may imitate\r\nthe movement of the lower jaw of the mosasaur by extending the\r\narms, clasping the hands, and bending the elbows.\r\n\r\nFLYING REPTILES. The atmosphere, which had hitherto been tenanted\r\nonly by insects, was first conquered by the vertebrates in the\r\nMesozoic. Pterosaurs, winged reptiles, whose whole organism was\r\nadapted for flight through the air, appeared in the Jurassic and\r\npassed off the stage of existence before the end of the\r\nCretaceous. The bones were hollow, as are those of birds. The\r\nsternum, or breastbone, was given a keel for the attachment of the\r\nwing muscles. The fifth finger, prodigiously lengthened, was\r\nturned backward to support a membrane which was attached to the\r\nbody and extended to the base of the tail. The other fingers were\r\nfree, and armed with sharp and delicate claws, as shown in Figures\r\n336 and 337.\r\n\r\nThese \"dragons of the air\" varied greatly in size; some were as\r\nsmall as sparrows, while others surpassed in stretch of wing the\r\nlargest birds of the present day. They may be divided into two\r\ngroups. The earliest group comprises genera with jaws set with\r\nteeth, and with long tails sometimes provided with a rudderlike\r\nexpansion at the end. In their successors of the later group the\r\ntail had become short, and in some of the genera the teeth had\r\ndisappeared. Among the latest of the flying reptiles was\r\nORNITHOSTOMA (bird beak), the largest creature which ever flew,\r\nand whose remains are imbedded in the offshore deposits of the\r\nCretaceous sea which held sway over our western plains.\r\nOrnithostoma's spread of wings was twenty feet. Its bones were a\r\nmarvel of lightness, the entire skeleton, even in its petrified\r\ncondition, not weighing more than five or six pounds. The sharp\r\nbeak, a yard long, was toothless and bird-like, as its name\r\nsuggests\r\n\r\nBIRDS. The earliest known birds are found in the Jurassic, and\r\nduring the remainder of the Mesozoic they contended with the\r\nflying reptiles for the empire of the air. The first feathered\r\ncreatures were very different from the birds of to-day. Their\r\ncharacteristics prove them an offshoot of the dinosaur line of\r\nreptiles. ARCHAEOPTERYX (ANCIENT BIRD) (Fig. 338) exhibits a\r\nstrange mingling of bird and reptile. Like birds, it was fledged\r\nwith perfect feathers, at least on wings and tail, but it retained\r\nthe teeth of the reptile, and its long tail was vertebrated, a\r\npair of feathers springing from each joint. Throughout the\r\nJurassic and Cretaceous the remains of birds are far less common\r\nthan those of flying reptiles, and strata representing hundreds of\r\nthousands of years intervene between Archaeopteryx and the next\r\nbirds of which we know, whose skeletons occur in the Cretaceous\r\nbeds of western Kansas.\r\n\r\nMAMMALS. So far as the entries upon the geological record show,\r\nmammals made their advent in a very humble way during the Trias.\r\nThese earliest of vertebrates which suckle their young were no\r\nbigger than young kittens, and their strong affinities with the\r\ntheromorphs suggest that their ancestors are to be found among\r\nsome generalized types of that order of reptiles.\r\n\r\nDuring the long ages of the Mesozoic, mammals continued small and\r\nfew, and were completely dominated by the reptiles. Their remains\r\nare exceedingly rare, and consist of minute scattered teeth,--with\r\nan occasional detached jaw,--which prove them to have been flesh\r\nor insect eaters. In the same way their affinities are seen to be\r\nwith the lowest of mammals,--the MONOTREMES and MARSUPIALS. The\r\nmonotremes,--such as the duckbill mole and the spiny ant-eater of\r\nAustralia, reproduce by means of eggs resembling those of\r\nreptiles; the marsupials, such as the opossum and the kangaroo,\r\nbring forth their young alive, but in a very immature condition,\r\nand carry them for some time after birth in the marsupium, a pouch\r\non the ventral side of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE TERTIARY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CENOZOIC ERA. The last stages of the Cretaceous are marked by\r\na decadence of the reptiles. By the end of that period the\r\nreptilian forms characteristic of the time had become extinct one\r\nafter another, leaving to represent the class only the types of\r\nreptiles which continue to modern times. The day of the ammonite\r\nand the belemnite also now drew to a close, and only a few of\r\nthese cephalopods were left to survive the period. It is therefore\r\nat the close of the Cretaceous that the line is drawn which marks\r\nthe end of the Middle Age of geology and the beginning of the\r\nCenozoic era, the era of modern life,--the Age of Mammals.\r\n\r\nIn place of the giant reptiles, mammals now become masters of the\r\nland, appearing first in generalized types which, during the long\r\nages of the era, gradually evolve to higher forms, more\r\nspecialized and ever more closely resembling the mammals of the\r\npresent. In the atmosphere the flying dragons of the Mesozoic give\r\nplace to birds and bats. In the sea, whales, sharks, and teleost\r\nfishes of modern types rule in the stead of huge swimming\r\nreptiles. The lower vertebrates, the invertebrates of land and\r\nsea, and the plants of field and forest take on a modern aspect,\r\nand differ little more from those of to-day than the plants and\r\nanimals of different countries now differ from one another. From\r\nthe beginning of the Cenozoic era until now there is a steadily\r\nincreasing number of species of animals and plants which have\r\ncontinued to exist to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe Cenozoic era comprises two divisions,--the TERTIARY period and\r\nthe QUATERNARY period.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of geology the formations of the entire\r\ngeological record, so far as it was then known, were divided into\r\nthree groups,--the PRIMARY, the SECONDARY (now known as the\r\nMesozoic), and the TERTIARY, When the third group was subdivided\r\ninto two systems, the term Tertiary was retained for the first\r\nsystem of the two, while the term QUATERNARY was used to designate\r\nthe second.\r\n\r\nDIVISIONS OF THE TERTIARY. The formations of the Tertiary are\r\ngrouped in three divisions,--the PLIOCENE (more recent), the\r\nMIOCENE (less recent), and the EOCENE (the dawn of the recent).\r\nEach of these epochs is long and complex. Their various sub-\r\ndivisions are distinguished each by its own peculiar organisms,\r\nand the changes of physical geography recorded in their strata. In\r\nthe rapid view which we are compelled to take we can note only a\r\nfew of the most conspicuous events of the period.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE TERTIARY IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA. The\r\nTertiary rocks of eastern North America are marine deposits and\r\noccupy the coastal lowlands of the Atlantic and Gulf states (Fig.\r\n260). In New England, Tertiary beds occur on the island of\r\nMartha's Vineyard, but not on the mainland; hence the shore line\r\nhere stood somewhat farther out than now. From New Jersey\r\nsouthward the earliest Tertiary sands and clays, still\r\nunconsolidated, leave only a narrow strip of the edge of the\r\nCretaceous between them and the Triassic and crystalline rocks of\r\nthe Piedmont oldland; hence the Atlantic shore here stood farther\r\nin than now, and at the beginning of the period the present\r\ncoastal plain was continental delta. A broad belt of Tertiary sea-\r\nlaid limestones, sandstones, and shales surrounds the Gulf of\r\nMexico and extends northward up the Mississippi embayment to the\r\nmouth of the Ohio River; hence the Gulf was then larger than at\r\npresent, and its waters reached in a broad bay far up the\r\nMississippi valley.\r\n\r\nAlong the Atlantic coast the Mesozoic peneplain may be traced\r\nshoreward to where it disappears from view beneath an\r\nunconformable cover of early Tertiary marine strata. The beginning\r\nof the Tertiary was therefore marked by a subsidence. The wide\r\nerosion surface which at the close of the Mesozoic lay near sea\r\nlevel where the Appalachian Mountains and their neighboring\r\nplateaus and uplands now stand was lowered gently along its\r\nseaward edge beneath the Tertiary Atlantic to receive a cover of\r\nits sediments.\r\n\r\nAs the period progressed slight oscillations occurred from time to\r\ntime. Strips of coastal plain were added to the land, and as early\r\nas the close of the Miocene the shore lines of the Atlantic and\r\nGulf states had reached well-nigh their present place. Louisiana\r\nand Florida were the last areas to emerge wholly from the sea,--\r\nFlorida being formed by a broad transverse upwarp of the\r\ncontinental delta at the opening of the Miocene, forming first an\r\nisland, which afterwards was joined to the mainland.\r\n\r\nTHE PACIFIC COAST. Tertiary deposits with marine fossils occur\r\nalong the western foothills of the Sierra Nevadas, and are\r\ncrumpled among the mountain masses of the Coast Ranges; it is\r\nhence inferred that the Great Valley of California was then a\r\nborder sea, separated from the ocean by a chain of mountainous\r\nislands which were upridged into the Coast Ranges at a still later\r\ntime. Tertiary marine strata are spread over the lower Columbia\r\nvalley and that of Puget Sound, showing that the Pacific came in\r\nbroadly there.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERIOR OF THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. The closing stages of\r\nthe Mesozoic were marked, as we have seen, by the upheaval of the\r\nRocky Mountains and other western ranges. The bases of the\r\nmountains are now skirted by widespread Tertiary deposits, which\r\nform the highest strata of the lofty plateaus from the level of\r\nwhose summits the mountains rise. Like the recent alluvium of the\r\nGreat Valley of California, these deposits imply low-lying lands\r\nwhen they were laid, and therefore at that time the mountains rose\r\nfrom near sea level. But the height at which the Tertiary strata\r\nnow stand--five thousand feet above the sea at Denver, and twice\r\nthat height in the plateaus of southern Utah--proves that the\r\nplateaus of which the Tertiary strata form a part have been\r\nuplifted during the Cenozoic. During their uplift, warping formed\r\nextensive basins both east and west of the Rockies, and in these\r\nbasins stream-swept and lake-laid waste gathered to depths of\r\nhundreds and thousands of feet, as it is accumulating at present\r\nin the Great Valley of California and on the river plains of\r\nTurkestan. The Tertiary river deposits of the High Plains have\r\nalready been described. How widespread are these ancient river\r\nplains and beds of fresh-water lakes may be seen in the map of\r\nFigure 260.\r\n\r\nTHE BAD LANDS. In several of the western states large areas of\r\nTertiary fresh-water deposits have been dissected to a maze of\r\nhills whose steep sides are cut with innumerable ravines. The\r\ndeposits of these ancient river plains and lake beds are little\r\ncemented and because of the dryness of the climate are unprotected\r\nby vegetation; hence they are easily carved by the wet-weather\r\nrills of scanty and infrequent rains. These waterless, rugged\r\nsurfaces were named by the early French explorers the BAD LANDS\r\nbecause they were found so difficult to traverse. The strata of\r\nthe Bad Lands contain vast numbers of the remains of the animals\r\nof Tertiary times, and the large amount of barren surface exposed\r\nto view makes search for fossils easy and fruitful. These desolate\r\ntracts are therefore frequently visited by scientific collecting\r\nexpeditions.\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN MAKING IN THE TERTIARY. The Tertiary period included\r\nepochs when the earth's crust was singularly unquiet. From time to\r\ntime on all the continents subterranean forces gathered head, and\r\nthe crust was bent and broken and upridged in lofty mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Nevada range was formed, as we have seen, by strata\r\ncrumpling at the end of the Jurassic. But since that remote time\r\nthe upfolded mountains had been worn to plains and hilly uplands,\r\nthe remnants of whose uplifted erosion surfaces may now be traced\r\nalong the western mountain slopes. Beginning late in the Tertiary,\r\nthe region was again affected by mountain-making movements. A\r\nseries of displacements along a profound fault on the eastern side\r\ntilted the enormous earth block of the Sierras to the west,\r\nlifting its eastern edge to form the lofty crest and giving to the\r\nrange a steep eastern front and a gentle descent toward the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nThe Coast Ranges also have had a complex history with many\r\nvicissitudes. The earliest foldings of their strata belong to the\r\nclose of the Jurassic, but it was not until the end of the Miocene\r\nthat the line of mountainous islands and the heavy sediments which\r\nhad been deposited on their submerged flanks were crushed into a\r\ncontinuous mountain chain. Thick Pliocene beds upon their sides\r\nprove that they were depressed to near sea level during the later\r\nTertiary. At the close of the Pliocene the Coast Ranges rose along\r\nwith the upheaval of the Sierra, and their gradual uplift has\r\ncontinued to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe numerous north-south ranges of the Great Basin and the Mount\r\nSaint Elias range of Alaska were also uptilted during the\r\nTertiary.\r\n\r\nDuring the Tertiary period many of the loftiest mountains of the\r\nearth--the Alps, the Apennines, the Pyrenees, the Atlas, the\r\nCaucasus, and the Himalayas--received the uplift to which they owe\r\nmost of their colossal bulk and height, as portions of the\r\nTertiary sea beds now found high upon their flanks attest. In the\r\nHimalayas, Tertiary marine limestones occur sixteen thousand five\r\nhundred feet above sea level.\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC ACTIVITY IN THE TERTIARY. The vast deformations of the\r\nTertiary were accompanied on a corresponding scale by outpourings\r\nof lava, the outburst of volcanoes, and the intrusion of molten\r\nmasses within the crust. In the Sierra Nevadas the Miocene river\r\ngravels of the valleys of the western slope, with their placer\r\ndeposits of gold, were buried beneath streams of lava and beds of\r\ntuff. Volcanoes broke forth along the Rocky Mountains and on the\r\nplateaus of Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona.\r\n\r\nMount Shasta and the immense volcanic piles of the Cascades date\r\nfrom this period. The mountain basin of the Yellowstone Park was\r\nfilled to a depth of several thousand feet with tuffs and lavas,\r\nthe oldest dating as far back as the beginning of the Tertiary.\r\nCrandall volcano was reared in the Miocene and the latest\r\neruptions of the Park are far more recent.\r\n\r\nTHE COLUMBIA AND SNAKE RIVER LAVAS. Still more important is the\r\nplateau of lava, more than two hundred thousand square miles in\r\narea, extending from the Yellowstone Park to the Cascade\r\nMountains, which has been built from Miocene times to the present.\r\n\r\nOver this plateau, which occupies large portions of Idaho,\r\nWashington, and Oregon, and extends into northern California and\r\nNevada, the country rock is basaltic lava. For thousands of square\r\nmiles the surface is a lava plain which meets the boundary\r\nmountains as a lake or sea meets a rugged and deeply indented\r\ncoast. The floods of molten rock spread up the mountain valleys\r\nfor a score of miles and more, the intervening spurs rising above\r\nthe lava like long peninsulas, while here and there an isolated\r\npeak was left to tower above the inundation like an island off a\r\nsubmerged shore.\r\n\r\nThe rivers which drain the plateau--the Snake, the Columbia, and\r\ntheir tributaries--have deeply trenched it, yet their canyons,\r\nwhich reach the depth of several thousand feet, have not been worn\r\nto the base of the lava except near the margin and where they cut\r\nthe summits of mountains drowned beneath the flood. Here and there\r\nthe plateau has been deformed. It has been upbent into great\r\nfolds, and broken into immense blocks of bedded lava, forming\r\nmountain ranges, which run parallel with the Pacific coast line.\r\nOn the edges of these tilted blocks the thickness of the lava is\r\nseen to be fully five thousand feet. The plateau has been built,\r\nlike that of Iceland, of innumerable overlapping sheets of lava.\r\nOn the canyon walls they weather back in horizontal terraces and\r\nlong talus slopes. One may distinguish each successive flow by its\r\ndense central portion, often jointed with large vertical columns,\r\nand the upper portion with its mass of confused irregular columns\r\nand scoriaceous surface. The average thickness of the flows seems\r\nto be about seventy-five feet.\r\n\r\nThe plateau was long in building. Between the layers are found in\r\nplaces old soil beds and forest grounds and the sediments of\r\nlakes. Hence the interval between the flows in any locality was\r\nsometimes long enough for clays to gather in the lakes which\r\nfilled depressions in the surface. Again and again the surface of\r\nthe black basalt was reddened by oxidation and decayed to soil,\r\nand forests had time to grow upon it before the succeeding\r\ninundation sealed the sediments and soils away beneath a sheet of\r\nstone. Near the edges of the lava plain, rivers from the\r\nsurrounding mountains spread sheets of sand and gravel on the\r\nsurface of one flow after another. These pervious sands,\r\ninterbedded with the lava, become the aquifers of artesian wells.\r\n\r\nIn places the lavas rest on extensive lake deposits, one thousand\r\nfeet deep, and Miocene in age as their fossils prove. It is to the\r\nmiddle Tertiary, then, that the earliest flows and the largest\r\nbulk of the great inundation belong. So ancient are the latest\r\nfloods in the Columbia basin that they have weathered to a\r\nresidual yellow clay from thirty to sixty feet in depth and\r\nmarvelously rich in the mineral substances on which plants feed.\r\n\r\nIn the Snake River valley the latest lavas are much younger. Their\r\nsurfaces are so fresh and undecayed that here the effusive\r\neruptions may well have continued to within the period of human\r\nhistory. Low lava domes like those of Iceland mark where last the\r\nbasalt outwelled and spread far and wide before it chilled (Fig.\r\n341). In places small mounds of scoria show that the eruptions\r\nwere accompanied to a slight degree by explosions of steam. So\r\nfluid was this superheated lava that recent flows have been traced\r\nfor more than fifty miles.\r\n\r\nThe rocks underlying the Columbia lavas, where exposed to view,\r\nare seen to be cut by numerous great dikes of dense basalt, which\r\nmark the fissures through which the molten rock rose to the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary included times of widespread and intense volcanic\r\naction in other continents as well as in North America. In Europe,\r\nVesuvius and Etna began their career as submarine volcanoes in\r\nconnection with earth movements which finally lifted Pliocene\r\ndeposits in Sicily to their present height,--four thousand feet\r\nabove the sea. Volcanoes broke forth in central France and\r\nsouthern Germany, in Hungary and the Carpathians. Innumerable\r\nfissures opened in the crust from the north of Ireland and the\r\nwestern islands of Scotland to the Faroes, Iceland, and even to\r\narctic Greenland; and here great plateaus were built of flows of\r\nbasalt similar to that of the Columbia River. In India, at the\r\nopening of the Tertiary, there had been an outwelling of basalt,\r\nflooding to a depth of thousands of feet two hundred thousand\r\nsquare miles of the northwestern part of the peninsula, and\r\nsimilar inundations of lava occurred where are now the table-lands\r\nof Abyssinia. From the middle Tertiary on, Asia Minor, Arabia, and\r\nPersia were the scenes of volcanic action. In Palestine the rise\r\nof the uplands of Judea at the close of the Eocene, and the\r\ndownfaulting of the Jordan valley were followed by volcanic\r\noutbursts. In comparison with the middle Tertiary, the present is\r\na time of volcanic inactivity and repose.\r\n\r\nEROSION OF TERTIARY MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAUS. The mountains and\r\nplateaus built at various times during the Tertiary and at its\r\ncommencement have been profoundly carved by erosive agents. The\r\nSierra Nevada Mountains have been dissected on the western slope\r\nby such canyons as those of King's River and the Yosemite. Six\r\nmiles of strata have been denuded from parts of the Wasatch\r\nMountains since their rise at the beginning of the era. From the\r\nColorado plateaus, whose uplift dates from the same time, there\r\nhave been stripped off ten thousand feet of strata over thousands\r\nof square miles, and the colossal canyon of the Colorado has been\r\ncut after this great denudation had been mostly accomplished.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the continent, as we have seen, a broad\r\npeneplain had been developed by the close of the Cretaceous. The\r\nremnants of this old erosion surface are now found upwarped to\r\nvarious heights in different portions of its area. In southern New\r\nEngland it now stands fifteen hundred feet above the sea in\r\nwestern Massachusetts, declining thence southward and eastward to\r\nsea level at the coast. In southwestern Virginia it has been\r\nlifted to four thousand feet above the sea. Manifestly this upwarp\r\noccurred since the peneplain was formed; it is later than the\r\nMesozoic, and the vast dissection which the peneplain has suffered\r\nsince its uplift must belong to the successive cycles of Cenozoic\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nRevived by the uplift, the streams of the area trenched it as\r\ndeeply as its elevation permitted, and reaching grade, opened up\r\nwide valleys and new peneplains in the softer rocks. The\r\nConnecticut valley is Tertiary in age, and in the weak Triassic\r\nsandstones has been widened in places to fifteen miles. Dating\r\nfrom the same time are the valleys of the Hudson, the Susquehanna,\r\nthe Delaware, the Potomac, and the Shenandoah.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania and the states lying to the south the Mesozoic\r\npeneplain lies along the summits of the mountain ridges. On the\r\nsurface of this ancient plain, Tertiary erosion etched out the\r\nbeautifully regular pattern of the Allegheny mountain ridges and\r\ntheir intervening valleys. The weaker strata of the long, regular\r\nfolds were eroded into longitudinal valleys, while the hard\r\nPaleozoic sandstones, such as the Medina and the Pocono, were left\r\nin relief as bold mountain walls whose even crests rise to the\r\ncommon level of the ancient plain. From Virginia far into Alabama\r\nthe great Appalachian valley was opened to a width in places of\r\nfifty miles and more, along a belt of intensely folded and faulted\r\nstrata where once was the heart of the Appalachian Mountains. In\r\nFigure 70 the summit of the Cumberland plateau (ab) marks the\r\nlevel of the Mesozoic peneplain, while the lower erosion levels\r\nare Tertiary and Quaternary in age.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THE TERTIARY PERIOD\r\n\r\nVEGETATION AND CLIMATE. The highest plants in structure, the\r\nDICOTYLS (such as our deciduous forest trees) and the MONOCOTYLS\r\n(represented by the palms), were introduced during the Cretaceous.\r\nThe vegetable kingdom reached its culmination before the animal\r\nkingdom, and if the dividing line between the Mesozoic and the\r\nCenozoic were drawn according to the progress of plant life, the\r\nCretaceous instead of the Tertiary would be made the opening\r\nperiod of the modern era.\r\n\r\nThe plants of the Tertiary belonged, for the most part, to genera\r\nnow living; but their distribution was very different from that of\r\nthe flora of to-day. In the earlier Tertiary, palms flourished\r\nover northern Europe, and in the northwestern United States grew\r\nthe magnolia and laurel, along with the walnut, oak, and elm. Even\r\nin northern Greenland and in Spitzbergen there were lakes covered\r\nwith water lilies and surrounded by forests of maples, poplars,\r\nlimes, the cypress of our southern states, and noble sequoias\r\nsimilar to the \"big trees\" and redwoods of California. A warm\r\nclimate like that of the Mesozoic, therefore, prevailed over North\r\nAmerica and Europe, extending far toward the pole. In the later\r\nTertiary the climate gradually became cooler. Palms disappeared\r\nfrom Europe, and everywhere the aspect of forests and open lands\r\nbecame more like that of to-day. Grasses became abundant,\r\nfurnishing a new food for herbivorous animals.\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE OF THE TERTIARY. Little needs to be said of the\r\nTertiary invertebrates, so nearly were they like the invertebrates\r\nof the present. Even in the Eocene, about five per cent of marine\r\nshells were of species still living, and in the Pliocene the\r\nproportion had risen to more than one half.\r\n\r\nFishes were of modern types. Teleosts were now abundant. The ocean\r\nteemed with sharks, some of them being voracious monsters seventy-\r\nfive feet and even more in length, with a gape of jaw of six feet,\r\nas estimated by the size of their enormous sharp-edged teeth.\r\n\r\nSnakes are found for the first time in the early Tertiary. These\r\nlimbless reptiles, evolved by degeneration from lizardlike\r\nancestors, appeared in nonpoisonous types scarcely to be\r\ndistinguished from those of the present day.\r\n\r\nMAMMALS OF THE EARLY TERTIARY. The fossils of continental deposits\r\nof the earliest Eocene show that a marked advance had now been\r\nmade in the evolution of the Mammalia. The higher mammals had\r\nappeared, and henceforth the lower mammals--the monotremes and\r\nthe marsupials--are reduced to a subordinate place.\r\n\r\nThese first true mammals were archaic and generalized in\r\nstructure. Their feet were of the primitive type, with five toes\r\nof about equal length. They were also PLANTIGRADES,--that is, they\r\ntouched the ground with the sole of the entire foot from toe to\r\nheel. No foot had yet become adapted to swift running by a\r\ndecrease in the number of digits and by lifting the heel and sole\r\nso that only the toes touch the ground,--a tread called\r\nDIGITIGRADE. Nor was there yet any foot like that of the cats,\r\nwith sharp retractile claws adapted to seizing and tearing the\r\nprey. The forearm and the lower leg each had still two separate\r\nbones (ulna and radius, fibula and tibia), neither pair having\r\nbeen replaced with a single strong bone, as in the leg of the\r\nhorse. The teeth also were primitive in type and of full number.\r\nThe complex heavy grinders of the horse and elephant, the sharp\r\ncutting teeth of the carnivores, and the cropping teeth of the\r\ngrass eaters were all still to come.\r\n\r\nPhenacodus is a characteristic genus of the early Eocene, whose\r\nspecies varied in size from that of a bulldog to that of an animal\r\na little larger than a sheep. Its feet were primitive, and their\r\nfive toes bore nails intermediate in form between a claw and a\r\nhoof. The archaic type of teeth indicates that the animal was\r\nomnivorous in diet. A cast of the brain cavity shows that, like\r\nits associates of the time, its brain was extremely small and\r\nnearly smooth, having little more than traces of convolutions.\r\n\r\nThe long ages of the Eocene and the following epochs of the\r\nTertiary were times of comparatively rapid evolution among the\r\nMammalia. The earliest forms evolved along diverging lines toward\r\nthe various specialized types of hoofed mammals, rodents,\r\ncarnivores, proboscidians, the primates, and the other mammalian\r\norders as we know them now. We must describe the Tertiary mammals\r\nvery briefly, tracing the lines of descent of only a few of the\r\nmore familiar mammals of the present.\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE. The pedigree of the horse runs back into the early\r\nEocene through many genera and species to a five-toed, [Footnote:\r\nOr, more accurately, with four perfect toes and a rudimentary\r\nfifth corresponding to the thumb.] short-legged ancestor little\r\nbigger than a cat. Its descendants gradually increased in stature\r\nand became better and better adapted to swift running to escape\r\ntheir foes. The leg became longer, and only the tip of the toes\r\nstruck the ground. The middle toe (digit number three), originally\r\nthe longest of the five, steadily enlarged, while the remaining\r\ndigits dwindled and disappeared. The inner digit, corresponding to\r\nthe great toe and thumb, was the first to go. Next number five,\r\nthe little finger, was also dropped. By the end of the Eocene a\r\nthree-toed genus of the horse family had appeared, as large as a\r\nsheep. The hoof of digit number three now supported most of the\r\nweight, but the slender hoofs of digits two and four were still\r\nserviceable. In the Miocene the stature of the ancestors of the\r\nhorse increased to that of a pony. The feet were still three-toed,\r\nbut the side hoofs were now mere dewclaws and scarcely touched the\r\nground. The evolution of the family was completed in the Pliocene.\r\n\r\nThe middle toe was enlarged still more, the side toes were\r\ndropped, and the palm and foot bones which supported them were\r\nreduced to splints.\r\n\r\nWhile these changes were in progress the radius and ulna of the\r\nfore limb became consolidated to a single bone; and in the hind\r\nlimb the fibula dwindled to a splint, while the tibia was\r\ncorrespondingly enlarged. The molars, also gradually lengthened,\r\nand became more and more complex on their grinding surface; the\r\nneck became longer; the brain steadily increased in size and its\r\nconvolutions became more abundant. The evolution of the horse has\r\nmade for greater fleetness and intelligence.\r\n\r\nTHE RHINOCEROS AND TAPIR. These animals, which are grouped with\r\nthe horse among the ODD-TOED (perissodactyl) mammals, are now\r\nverging toward extinction. In the rhinoceros, evolution seems to\r\nhave taken the opposite course from that of the horse. As the\r\nanimal increased in size it became more clumsy, its limbs became\r\nshorter and more massive, and, perhaps because of its great\r\nweight, the number of digits were not reduced below the number\r\nthree. Like other large herbivores, the rhinoceros, too slow to\r\nescape its enemies by flight, learned to withstand them. It\r\ndeveloped as its means of defense a nasal horn.\r\n\r\nPeculiar offshoots of the line appeared at various times in the\r\nTertiary. A rhinoceros, semiaquatic in habits, with curved tusks,\r\nresembling in aspect the hippopotamus, lived along the water\r\ncourses of the plains east of the Rockies, and its bones are now\r\nfound by the thousands in the Miocene of Kansas. Another developed\r\nalong a line parallel to that of the horse, and herds of these\r\nlight-limbed and swift-footed running rhinoceroses ranged the\r\nGreat Plains from the Dakotas southward.\r\n\r\nThe tapirs are an ancient family which has changed but little\r\nsince it separated from the other perissodactyl stocks in the\r\nearly Tertiary. At present, tapirs are found only in South America\r\nand southern Asia,--a remarkable distribution which we could not\r\nexplain were it not that the geological record shows that during\r\nTertiary times tapirs ranged throughout the northern hemisphere,\r\nmaking their way to South America late in that period. During the\r\nPleistocene they became extinct over all the intervening lands\r\nbetween the widely separated regions where now they live. The\r\ngeographic distribution of animals, as well as their relationships\r\nand origins, can be understood only through a study of their\r\ngeological history.\r\n\r\nTHE PROBOSCIDIANS. This unique order of hoofed mammals, of which\r\nthe elephant is the sole survivor, began, so far as known, in the\r\nEocene, in Egypt, with a piglike ancestor the size of a small\r\nhorse, with cheek teeth like the Mastodon's, but wanting both\r\ntrunk and tusks. A proboscidian came next with four short tusks,\r\nand in the Miocene there followed a Mastodon (Fig. 346) armed with\r\ntwo pairs of long, straight tusks on which rested a flexible\r\nproboscis.\r\n\r\nThe DINOTHERE was a curious offshoot of the line, which developed\r\nin the Miocene in Europe. In this immense proboscidian, whose\r\nskull was three feet long, the upper pair of tusks had\r\ndisappeared, and those of the lower jaw were bent down with a\r\nbackward curve in walrus fashion.\r\n\r\nIn the true ELEPHANTS, which do not appear until near the close of\r\nthe Tertiary, the lower jaw loses its tusks and the grinding teeth\r\nbecome exceedingly complex in structure. The grinding teeth of the\r\nmastodon had long roots and low crowns crossed by four or five\r\npeaked enameled ridges. In the teeth of the true elephants the\r\ncrown has become deep, and the ridges of enamel have changed to\r\nnumerous upright, platelike folds, their interspaces filled with\r\ncement. The two genera--Mastodon and Elephant--are connected by\r\nspecies whose teeth are intermediate in pattern. The proboscidians\r\nculminated in the Pliocene, when some of the giant elephants\r\nreached a height of fourteen feet.\r\n\r\nTHE ARTIODACTYLS comprise the hoofed Mammalia which have an even\r\nnumber of toes, such as cattle, sheep, and swine. Like the\r\nperissodactyls, they are descended from the primitive five-toed\r\nplantigrade mammals of the lowest Eocene. In their evolution,\r\ndigit number one was first dropped, and the middle pair became\r\nlarger and more massive, while the side digits, numbers two and\r\nfive, became shorter, weaker, and less serviceable. The FOUR-TOED\r\nARTIODACTYLS culminated in the Tertiary; at present they are\r\nrepresented only by the hippopotamus and the hog. Along the main\r\nline of the evolution of the artiodactyls the side toes, digits\r\ntwo and five, disappeared, leaving as proof that they once existed\r\nthe corresponding bones of palm and sole as splints. The TWO-TOED\r\nARTIODACTYLS, such as the camels, deer, cattle, and sheep, are now\r\nthe leading types of the herbivores.\r\n\r\nSWINE AND PECCARIES are two branches of a common stock, the first\r\ndeveloping in the Old World and the second in the New. In the\r\nMiocene a noticeable offshoot of the line was a gigantic piglike\r\nbrute, a root eater, with a skull a yard in length, whose remains\r\nare now found in Colorado and South Dakota.\r\n\r\nCAMELS AND LLAMAS. The line of camels and llamas developed in\r\nNorth America, where the successive changes from an early Eocene\r\nancestor, no larger than a rabbit, are traced step by step to the\r\npresent forms, as clearly as is the evolution of the horse. In the\r\nlate Miocene some of the ancestral forms migrated to the Old World\r\nby way of a land connection where Bering Strait now is, and there\r\ngave rise to the camels and dromedaries. Others migrated into\r\nSouth America, which had now been connected with our own\r\ncontinent, and these developed into the llamas and guanacos, while\r\nthose of the race which remained in North America became extinct\r\nduring the Pleistocene.\r\n\r\nSome peculiar branches of the camel stem appeared in North\r\nAmerica. In the Pliocene arose a llama with the long neck and\r\nlimbs of a giraffe, whose food was cropped from the leaves and\r\nbranches of trees. Far more generalized in structure was the\r\nOreodon, an animal related to the camels, but with distinct\r\naffinities also with other lines, such as those of the hog and\r\ndeer. These curious creatures were much like the peccary in\r\nappearance, except for their long tails. In the middle Eocene they\r\nroamed in vast herds from Oregon to Kansas and Nebraska.\r\n\r\nTHE RUMINANTS. This division of the artiodactyls includes\r\nantelopes, deer, oxen, bison, sheep, and goats,--all of which\r\nbelong to a common stock which took its rise in Europe in the\r\nupper Eocene from ancestral forms akin to those of the camels. In\r\nthe Miocene the evolution of the two-toed artiodactyl foot was\r\nwell-nigh completed. Bonelike growths appeared on the head, and\r\nthe two groups of the ruminants became specialized,--the deer with\r\nbony antlers, shed and renewed each year, and the ruminants with\r\nhollow horns, whose two bony knobs upon the skull are covered with\r\npermanent, pointed, horny sheaths.\r\n\r\nThe ruminants evolved in the Old World, and it was not until the\r\nlater Miocene that the ancestors of the antelope and of some deer\r\nfound their way to North America. Mountain sheep and goats, the\r\nbison and most of the deer, did not arrive until after the close\r\nof the Tertiary, and sheep and oxen were introduced by man.\r\n\r\nThe hoofed mammals of the Tertiary included many offshoots from\r\nthe main lines which we have traced. Among them were a number of\r\ngenera of clumsy, ponderous brutes, some almost elephantine in\r\ntheir bulk.\r\n\r\nTHE CARNIVORES. The ancestral lines of the families of the flesh\r\neaters--such as the cats (lions, tigers, etc.), the bears, the\r\nhyenas, and the dogs (including wolves and foxes)--converge in the\r\ncreodonts of the early Eocene,--an order so generalized that it\r\nhad affinities not only with the carnivores but also with the\r\ninsect eaters, the marsupials, and the hoofed mammals as well.\r\nFrom these primitive flesh eaters, with small and simple brains,\r\nnumerous small teeth, and plantigrade tread, the different\r\nfamilies of the carnivores of the present have slowly evolved.\r\n\r\nDOGS AND BEARS. The dog family diverged from the creodonts late in\r\nthe Eocene, and divided into two branches, one of which evolved\r\nthe wolves and the other the foxes. An offshoot gave rise to the\r\nfamily of the bears, and so closely do these two families, now\r\nwide apart, approach as we trace them back in Tertiary times that\r\nthe Amphicyon, a genus doglike in its teeth and bearlike in other\r\nstructures, is referred by some to the dog and by others to the\r\nbear family. The well-known plantigrade tread of bears is a\r\nprimitive characteristic which has survived from their creodont\r\nancestry.\r\n\r\nCATS. The family of the cats, the most highly specialized of all\r\nthe carnivores, divided in the Tertiary into two main branches.\r\nOne, the saber-tooth tigers (Fig. 351), which takes its name from\r\ntheir long, saberlike, sharp-edged upper canine teeth, evolved a\r\nsuccession of genera and species, among them some of the most\r\ndestructive beasts of prey which ever scourged the earth. They\r\nwere masters of the entire northern hemisphere during the middle\r\nTertiary, but in Europe during the Pliocene they declined, from\r\nunknown causes, and gave place to the other branch of cats,--which\r\nincludes the lions, tigers, and leopards. In the Americas the\r\nsaber-tooth tigers long survived the epoch.\r\n\r\nMARINE MAMMALS. The carnivorous mammals of the sea--whales,\r\nseals, walruses, etc.--seem to have been derived from some of the\r\ncreodonts of the early Tertiary by adaptation to aquatic life.\r\nWhales evolved from some land ancestry at a very early date in the\r\nTertiary; in the marine deposits of the Eocene are found the bones\r\nof the Zeuglodon, a whalelike creature seventy feet in length.\r\n\r\nPRIMATES. This order, which includes lemurs, monkeys, apes, and\r\nman, seems to have sprung from a creodont or insectivorous\r\nancestry in the lower Eocene. Lemur-like types, with small, smooth\r\nbrains, were abundant in the United States in the early Tertiary,\r\nbut no primates have been found here in the middle Tertiary and\r\nlater strata. In Europe true monkeys were introduced in the\r\nMiocene, and were abundant until the close of the Tertiary, when\r\nthey were driven from the continent by the increasing cold.\r\n\r\nADVANCE OF THE MAMMALIA DURING THE TERTIARY. During the several\r\nmillions of years comprised in Tertiary time the mammals evolved\r\nfrom the lowly, simple types which tenanted the earth at the\r\nbeginning of the period, into the many kinds of highly specialized\r\nmammals of the Pleistocene and the present, each with the various\r\nstructures of the body adapted to its own peculiar mode of life.\r\nThe swift feet of the horse, the horns of cattle and the antlers\r\nof the deer, the lion's claws and teeth, the long incisors of the\r\nbeaver, the proboscis of the elephant, were all developed in\r\nTertiary times. In especial the brain of the Tertiary mammals\r\nconstantly grew larger relatively to the size of body, and the\r\nhigher portion of the brain--the cerebral lobes--increased in size\r\nin comparison with the cerebellum. Some of the hoofed mammals now\r\nhave a brain eight or ten times the size of that of their early\r\nTertiary predecessors of equal bulk. Nor can we doubt that along\r\nwith the increasing size of brain went a corresponding increase in\r\nthe keenness of the senses, in activity and vigor, and in\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE QUATERNARY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last period of geological history, the Quaternary, may be said\r\nto have begun when all, or nearly all, living species of mollusks\r\nand most of the existing mammals had appeared.\r\n\r\nIt is divided into two great epochs. The first, the Pleistocene or\r\nGlacial epoch, is marked off from the Tertiary by the occupation\r\nof the northern parts of North America and Europe by vast ice\r\nsheets; the second, the Recent epoch, began with the disappearance\r\nof the ice sheets from these continents, and merges into the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nTHE PLEISTOCENE EPOCH\r\n\r\nWe now come to an episode of unusual interest, so different was it\r\nfrom most of the preceding epochs and from the present, and so\r\nlargely has it influenced the conditions of man's life.\r\n\r\nThe records of the Glacial epoch are so plain and full that we are\r\ncompelled to believe what otherwise would seem almost incredible,\r\n--that following the mild climate of the Tertiary came a succession\r\nof ages when ice fields, like that of Greenland, shrouded the\r\nnorthern parts of North America and Europe and extended far into\r\ntemperate latitudes.\r\n\r\nTHE DRIFT. Our studies of glaciers have prepared us to decipher\r\nand interpret the history of the Glacial epoch, as it is recorded\r\nin the surface deposits known as the drift. Over most of Canada\r\nand the northern states this familiar formation is exposed to view\r\nin nearly all cuttings which pass below the surface soil. The\r\ndrift includes two distinct classes of deposits,--the unstratified\r\ndrift laid down by glacier ice, and the stratified drift spread by\r\nglacier waters.\r\n\r\nThe materials of the drift are in any given place in part unlike\r\nthe rock on which it rests. They cannot be derived from the\r\nunderlying rock by weathering, but have been brought from\r\nelsewhere. Thus where a region is underlain by sedimentary rocks,\r\nas is the drift-covered area from the Hudson River to the\r\nMissouri, the drift contains not only fragments of limestone,\r\nsandstone, and shale of local derivation, but also pebbles of many\r\nigneous and metamorphic rocks, such as granites, gneisses,\r\nschists, dike rocks, quartzites, and the quartz of mineral veins,\r\nwhose nearest source is the Archean area of Canada and the states\r\nof our northern border. The drift received its name when it was\r\nsupposed that the formation had been drifted by floods and\r\nicebergs from outside sources,--a theory long since abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe distribution also of the drift points clearly to its peculiar\r\norigin. Within the limits of the glaciated area it covers the\r\ncountry without regard to the relief, mantling with its debris not\r\nonly lowlands and valleys but also highlands and mountain slopes.\r\n\r\nThe boundary of the drift is equally independent of the relief of\r\nthe land, crossing hills and plains impartially, unlike water-laid\r\ndeposits, whose margins, unless subsequently deformed, are\r\nhorizontal. The boundary of the drift is strikingly lobate also,\r\nbending outward in broad, convex curves, where there are no\r\nnatural barriers in the topography of the country to set it such a\r\nlimit. Under these conditions such a lobate margin cannot belong\r\nto deposits of rivers, lakes, or ocean, but is precisely that\r\nwhich would mark the edge of a continental glacier which deployed\r\nin broad tongues of ice.\r\n\r\nTHE ROCK SURFACE UNDERLYING THE DRIFT. Over much of its area the\r\ndrift rests on firm, fresh rock, showing that both the preglacial\r\nmantle of residual waste and the partially decomposed and broken\r\nrock beneath it have been swept away. The underlying rock,\r\nespecially if massive, hard, and of a fine grain, has often been\r\nground down to a smooth surface and rubbed to a polish as perfect\r\nas that seen on the rock beside an Alpine glacier where the ice\r\nhas recently melted back. Frequently it has been worn to the\r\nsmooth, rounded hummocks known as roches moutonnees, and even\r\nrocky hills have been thus smoothed to flowing outlines like\r\nroches moutonnees on a gigantic scale. The rock pavement beneath\r\nthe drift is also marked by long, straight, parallel scorings,\r\nvarying in size from deep grooves to fine striae as delicate as\r\nthe hair lines cut by an engraver's needle. Where the rock is soft\r\nor closely jointed it is often shattered to a depth of several\r\nfeet beneath the drift, while stony clay has been thrust in among\r\nthe fragments into which the rock is broken.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of these glaciated surfaces we cannot doubt that\r\nthe area of the drift has been overridden by vast sheets of ice\r\nwhich, in their steady flow, rasped and scored the rock bed\r\nbeneath by means of the stones with which their basal layers were\r\ninset, and in places plucked and shattered it.\r\n\r\nTILL. The unstratified portion of the drift consists chiefly of\r\nsheets of dense, stony clay called till, which clearly are the\r\nground moraines of ancient continental glaciers. Till is an\r\nunsorted mixture of materials of all sizes, from fine clay and\r\nsand, gravel, pebbles, and cobblestones, to large bowlders. The\r\nstones of the till are of many kinds, some having been plucked\r\nfrom the bed rock of the locality where they are found, and others\r\nhaving been brought from outside and often distant places. Land\r\nice is the only agent known which can spread unstratified material\r\nin such extensive sheets.\r\n\r\nThe FINE MATERIAL of the till comes from two different sources. In\r\npart it is derived from old residual clays, which in the making\r\nhad been leached of the lime and other soluble ingredients of the\r\nrock from which they weathered. In part it consists of sound rock\r\nground fine; a drop of acid on fresh, clayey till often proves by\r\nbrisk effervescence that the till contains much undecayed\r\nlimestone flour. The ice sheet, therefore, both scraped up the\r\nmantle of long-weathered waste which covered the coun try before\r\nits coming, and also ground heavily upon the sound rock\r\nunderneath, and crushed and wore to rock flour the fragments which\r\nit carried.\r\n\r\nThe color of unweathered till depends on that of the materials of\r\nwhich it is composed. Where red sandstones have contributed\r\nlargely to its making, as over the Triassic sandstones of the\r\neastern states and the Algonkian sandstones about Lake Superior,\r\nthe drift is reddish. When derived in part from coaly shales, as\r\nover many outcrops of the Pennsylvanian, it may when moist be\r\nalmost black. Fresh till is normally a dull gray or bluish, so\r\nlargely is it made up of the grindings of unoxidized rocks of\r\nthese common colors.\r\n\r\nExcept where composed chiefly of sand or coarser stuff,\r\nunweathered till is often exceedingly dense. Can you suggest by\r\nwhat means it has been thus compacted? Did the ice fields of the\r\nGlacial epoch bear heavy surface moraines like the medial and\r\nlateral moraines of valley glaciers? Where was the greater part of\r\nthe load of these ice fields carried, judging from what you know\r\nof the glaciers of Greenland?\r\n\r\nBOWLDERS OF THE DRIFT. The pebbles and bowlders of the drift are\r\nin part stream gravels, bowlders of weathering, and other coarse\r\nrock waste picked up from the surface of the country by the\r\nadvancing ice, and in part are fragments plucked from ledges of\r\nsound rock after the mantle of waste had been removed. Many of the\r\nstones of the till are dressed as only glacier ice can do; their\r\nsharp edges have been blunted and their sides faceted and scored.\r\n\r\nWe may easily find all stages of this process represented among\r\nthe pebbles of the till. Some are little worn, even on their\r\nedges; some are planed and scored on one side only; while some in\r\ntheir long journey have been ground down to many facets and have\r\nlost much of their original bulk. Evidently the ice played fast\r\nand loose with a stone carried in its basal layers, now holding it\r\nfast and rubbing it against the rock beneath, now loosening its\r\ngrasp and allowing the stone to turn.\r\n\r\nBowlders of the drift are sometimes found on higher ground than\r\ntheir parent ledges. Thus bowlders have been left on the sides of\r\nMount Katahdin, Maine, which were plucked from limestone ledges\r\ntwelve miles distant and three thousand feet lower than their\r\nresting place. In other cases stones have been carried over\r\nmountain ranges, as in Vermont, where pebbles of Burlington red\r\nsandstone were dragged over the Green Mountains, three thousand\r\nfeet in height, and left in the Connecticut valley sixty miles\r\naway. No other geological agent than glacier ice could do this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe bowlders of the drift are often large. Bowlders ten and twenty\r\nfeet in diameter are not uncommon, and some are known whose\r\ndiameter exceeds fifty feet. As a rule the average size of\r\nbowlders decreases with increasing distance from their sources.\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nTILL PLAINS. The surface of the drift, where left in its initial\r\nstate, also displays clear proof of its glacial origin. Over large\r\nareas it is spread in level plains of till, perhaps bowlder-\r\ndotted, similar to the plains of stony clay left in Spitzbergen by\r\nthe recent retreat of some of the glaciers of that island. In\r\nplaces the unstratified drift is heaped in hills of various kinds,\r\nwhich we will now describe.\r\n\r\nDRUMLINS. Drumlins are smooth, rounded hills composed of till,\r\nelliptical in base, and having their longer axes parallel to the\r\nmovement of the ice as shown by glacial scorings. They crowd\r\ncertain districts in central New York and in southern Wisconsin,\r\nwhere they may be counted by the thousands. Among the numerous\r\ndrumlins about Boston is historic Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\nDrumlins are made of ground moraine. They were accumulated and\r\ngiven shape beneath the overriding ice, much as are sand bars in a\r\nriver, or in some instances were carved, like roches moutonnees,\r\nby an ice sheet out of the till left by an earlier ice invasion.\r\n\r\nTERMINAL MORAINES. The glaciated area is crossed by belts of\r\nthickened drift, often a mile or two, and sometimes even ten miles\r\nand more, in breadth, which lie transverse to the movement of the\r\nice and clearly are the terminal moraines of ancient ice sheets,\r\nmarking either the limit of their farthest advance or pauses in\r\ntheir general retreat.\r\n\r\nThe surface of these moraines is a jumble of elevations and\r\ndepressions, which vary from low, gentle swells and shallow sags\r\nto sharp hills, a hundred feet or so in height, and deep, steep-\r\nsided hollows. Such tumultuous hills and hummocks, set with\r\ndepressions of all shapes, which usually are without outlet and\r\nare often occupied by marshes, ponds, and lakes, surely cannot be\r\nthe work of running water. The hills are heaps of drift, lodged\r\nbeneath the ice edge or piled along its front. The basins were\r\nleft among the tangle of morainic knolls and ridges as the margin\r\nof the ice moved back and forth. Some bowl-shaped basins were made\r\nby the melting of a mass of ice left behind by the retreating\r\nglacier and buried in its debris.\r\n\r\nTHE STRATIFIED DRIFT. Like modern glaciers the ice sheets of the\r\nPleistocene were ever being converted into water about their\r\nmargins. Their limits on the land were the lines where their\r\nonward flow was just balanced by melting and evaporation. On the\r\nsurface of the ice along the marginal zone, rivulets no doubt\r\nflowed in summer, and found their way through crevasses to the\r\ninterior of the glacier or to the ground. Subglacial streams, like\r\nthose of the Malaspina glacier, issued from tunnels in the ice,\r\nand water ran along the melting ice front as it is seen to do\r\nabout the glacier tongues of Greenland. All these glacier waters\r\nflowed away down the chief drainage channels in swollen rivers\r\nloaded with glacial waste.\r\n\r\nIt is not unexpected therefore that there are found, over all the\r\ncountry where the melting ice retreated, deposits made of the same\r\nmaterials as the till, but sorted and stratified by running water.\r\nSome of these were deposited behind the ice front in ice-walled\r\nchannels, some at the edge of the glaciers by issuing streams, and\r\nothers were spread to long distances in front of the ice edge by\r\nglacial waters as they flowed away.\r\n\r\nESKERS are narrow, winding ridges of stratified sand and gravel\r\nwhose general course lies parallel with the movement of the\r\nglacier. These ridges, though evidently laid by running water, do\r\nnot follow lines of continuous descent, but may be found to cross\r\nriver valleys and ascend their sides. Hence the streams by which\r\neskers were laid did not flow unconfined upon the surface of the\r\nground. We may infer that eskers were deposited in the tunnels and\r\nice-walled gorges of glacial streams before they issued from the\r\nice front.\r\n\r\nKAMES are sand and gravel knolls, associated for the most part\r\nwith terminal moraines, and heaped by glacial waters along the\r\nmargin of the ice.\r\n\r\nKAME TERRACES are hummocky embankments of stratified drift\r\nsometimes found in rugged regions along the sides of valleys. In\r\nthese valleys long tongues of glacier ice lay slowly melting.\r\nGlacial waters took their way between the edges of the glaciers\r\nand the hillside, and here deposited sand and gravel in rude\r\nterraces.\r\n\r\nOutwash plains are plains of sand and gravel which frequently\r\nborder terminal moraines on their outward face, and were spread\r\nevidently by outwash from the melting ice. Outwash plains are\r\nsometimes pitted by bowl-shaped basins where ice blocks were left\r\nburied in the sand by the retreating glacier.\r\n\r\nValley trains are deposits of stratified drift with which river\r\nvalleys have been aggraded. Valleys leading outward from the ice\r\nfront were flooded by glacial waters and were filled often to\r\ngreat depths with trains of stream-swept drift. Since the\r\ndisappearance of the ice these glacial flood plains have been\r\ndissected by the shrunken rivers of recent times and left on\r\neither side the valley in high terraces. Valley trains head in\r\nmorainic plains, and their material grows finer down valley and\r\ncoarser toward their sources. Their gradient is commonly greater\r\nthan that of the present rivers.\r\n\r\nTHE EXTENT OF THE DRIFT. The extent of the drift of North America\r\nand its southern limits are best seen in Figure 359. Its area is\r\nreckoned at about four million square miles. The ice fields which\r\nonce covered so much of our continent were all together ten times\r\nas large as the inland ice of Greenland, and about equal to the\r\nenormous ice cap which now covers the antartic regions.\r\n\r\nThe ice field of Europe was much smaller, measuring about seven\r\nhundred and seventy thousand square miles.\r\n\r\nCENTERS OF DISPERSION. The direction of the movement of the ice is\r\nrecorded plainly in the scorings of the rock surface, in the\r\nshapes of glaciated hills, in the axes of drumlins and eskers, and\r\nin trains of bowlders, when the ledges from which they were\r\nplucked can be discovered. In these ways it has been proved that\r\nin North America there were three centers where ice gathered to\r\nthe greatest depth, and from which it flowed in all directions\r\noutward. There were thus three vast ice fields,--one the\r\nCordilleran, which lay upon the Cordilleras of British America;\r\none the Keewatin, which flowed out from the province of Keewatin,\r\nwest of Hudson Bay; and one the LABRADOR ice field, whose center\r\nof dispersion was on the highlands of the peninsula of Labrador.\r\nAs shown in Figure 359, the western ice field extended but a short\r\nway beyond the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains, where\r\nperhaps it met the far-traveled ice from the great central field.\r\nThe Keewatin and the Labrador ice fields flowed farthest toward\r\nthe south, and in the Mississippi valley the one reached the mouth\r\nof the Missouri and the other nearly to the mouth of the Ohio. In\r\nMinnesota and Wisconsin and northward they merged in one vast\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the ice was so great that it buried the highest\r\nmountains of eastern North America, as is proved by the\r\ntransported bowlders which have been found upon their summits. If\r\nthe land then stood at its present height above sea level, and if\r\nthe average slope of the ice were no more than ten feet to the\r\nmile,--a slope so gentle that the eye could not detect it and less\r\nthan half the slope of the interior of the inland ice of\r\nGreenland,--the ice plateaus about Hudson Bay must have reached a\r\nthickness of at least ten thousand feet.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the Scandinavian plateau was the chief center of\r\ndispersion. At the time of greatest glaciation a continuous field\r\nof ice extended from the Ural Mountains to the Atlantic, where,\r\noff the coasts of Norway and the British Isles, it met the sea in\r\nan unbroken ice wall. On the south it reached to southern England,\r\nBelgium, and central Germany, and deployed on the eastern plains\r\nin wide lobes over Poland and central Russia (Fig. 360).\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Alps supported giant glaciers many times the\r\nsize of the surviving glaciers of to-day, and a piedmont glacier\r\ncovered the plains of northern Switzerland.\r\n\r\nTHE THICKNESS OF THE DRIFT. The drift is far from uniform in\r\nthickness. It is comparatively thin and scanty over the Laurentian\r\nhighlands and the rugged regions of New England, while from\r\nsouthern New York and Ontario westward over the Mississippi\r\nvalley, and on the great western plains of Canada, it exceeds an\r\naverage of one hundred feet over wide areas, and in places has\r\nfive and six times that thickness. It was to this marginal belt\r\nthat the ice sheets brought their loads, while northwards, nearer\r\nthe centers of dispersion, erosion was excessive and deposition\r\nslight.\r\n\r\nSUCCESSIVE ICE INVASIONS AND THEIR DRIFT SHEETS. Recent studies of\r\nthe drift prove that it does not consist of one indivisible\r\nformation, but includes a number of distinct drift sheets, each\r\nwith its own peculiar features. The Pleistocene epoch consisted,\r\ntherefore, of several glacial stages,--during each of which the\r\nice advanced far southward,--together with the intervening\r\ninterglacial stages when, under a milder climate, the ice melted\r\nback toward its sources or wholly disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe evidences of such interglacial stages, and the means by which\r\nthe different drift sheets are told apart, are illustrated in\r\nFigure 361. Here the country from N to S is wholly covered by\r\ndrift, but the drift from N to m is so unlike that from m to S\r\nthat we may believe it the product of a distinct ice invasion and\r\ndeposited during another and far later glacial stage. The former\r\ndrift is very young, for its drainage is as yet immature, and\r\nthere are many lakes and marshes upon its surface; the latter is\r\nfar older, for its surface has been thoroughly dissected by its\r\nstreams. The former is but slightly weathered, while the latter is\r\nso old that it is deeply reddened by oxidation and is leached of\r\nits soluble ingredients such as lime. The younger drift is\r\nbordered by a distinct terminal moraine, while the margin of the\r\nolder drift is not thus marked. Moreover, the two drift sheets are\r\nsomewhat unlike in composition, and the different proportion of\r\npebbles of the various kinds of rocks which they contain shows\r\nthat their respective glaciers followed different tracks and\r\ngathered their loads from different regions. Again, in places\r\nbeneath the younger drift there is found the buried land surface\r\nof an older drift with old soils, forest grounds, and vegetable\r\ndeposits, containing the remains of animals and plants, which tell\r\nof the climate of the interglacial stage in which they lived.\r\n\r\nBy such differences as these the following drift sheets have been\r\nmade out in America, and similar subdivisions have been recognized\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\n    5 The Wisconsin formation\r\n    4 The Iowan formation\r\n    3 The Illinoian formation\r\n    2 The Kansan formation\r\n    1 The pre-Kansan or Jerseyan formation\r\n\r\nIn New Jersey and Pennsylvania the edge of a deeply weathered and\r\neroded drift sheet, the Jerseyan, extends beyond the limits of a\r\nmuch younger overlying drift. It may be the equivalent of a deep-\r\nburied basal drift sheet found in the Mississippi valley beneath\r\nthe Kansan and parted from it by peat, old soil, and gravel beds.\r\n\r\nThe two succeeding stages mark the greatest snowfall of the\r\nGlacial epoch. In Kansan times the Keewatin ice field slowly grew\r\nsouthward until it reached fifteen hundred miles from its center\r\nof dispersion and extended from the Arctic Ocean to northeastern\r\nKansas. In the Illinoian stage the Labrador ice field stretched\r\nfrom Hudson Straits nearly to the Ohio River in Illinois. In the\r\nIowan and the Wisconsin, the closing stages of the Glacial epoch,\r\nthe readvancing ice fields fell far short of their former limits\r\nin the Mississippi valley, but in the eastern states the Labrador\r\nice field during Wisconsin times overrode for the most part all\r\nearlier deposits, and, covering New England, probably met the\r\nocean in a continuous wall of ice which set its bergs afloat from\r\nMassachusetts to northern Labrador.\r\n\r\nWe select for detailed description the Kansan and the Wisconsin\r\nformations as representatives, the one of the older and the other\r\nof the younger drift sheets.\r\n\r\nTHE KANSAN FORMATION. The Kansan drift consists for the most part\r\nof a sheet of clayey till carrying smaller bowlders than the later\r\ndrift. Few traces of drumlins, kames, or terminal moraines are\r\nfound upon the Kansan drift, and where thick enough to mask the\r\npreexisting surface, it seems to have been spread originally in\r\nlevel plains of till.\r\n\r\nThe initial Kansan plain has been worn by running water until\r\nthere are now left only isolated patches and the narrow strips and\r\ncrests of the divides, which still rise to the ancient level. The\r\nvalleys of the larger streams have been opened wide. Their well-\r\ndeveloped tributaries have carved nearly the entire plain to\r\nvalley slopes (Figs. 50 B, and 59). The lakes and marshes which\r\nonce marked the infancy of the region have long since been\r\neffaced. The drift is also deeply weathered. The till, originally\r\nblue in color, has been yellowed by oxidation to a depth of ten\r\nand twenty feet and even more, and its surface is sometimes rusted\r\nto terra-cotta red. To a somewhat less depth it has been leached\r\nof its lime and other soluble ingredients. In the weathered zone\r\nits pebbles, especially where the till is loose in texture, are\r\nsometimes so rotted that granites may be crumbled with the\r\nfingers. The Kansan drift is therefore old.\r\n\r\nTHE WISCONSIN FORMATION. The Wisconsin drift sheet is but little\r\nweathered and eroded, and therefore is extremely young. Oxidation\r\nhas effected it but slightly, and lime and other soluble plant\r\nfoods remain undissolved even at the grass roots. Its river\r\nsystems are still in their infancy (Fig. 50, A). Swamps and peat\r\nbogs are abundant on its undrained surface, and to this drift\r\nsheet belong the lake lands of our northern states and of the\r\nLaurentian peneplain of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe lake basins of the Wisconsin drift are of several different\r\nclasses. Many are shallow sags in the ground moraine. Still more\r\nnumerous are the lakes set in hollows among the hills of the\r\nterminal moraines; such as the thousands of lakelets of eastern\r\nMassachusetts. Indeed, the terminal moraines of the Wisconsin\r\ndrift may often be roughly traced on maps by means of belts of\r\nlakes and ponds. Some lakes are due to the blockade of ancient\r\nvalleys by morainic delms, and this class includes many of the\r\nlakes of the Adirondacks, the mountain regions of New England,\r\nand the Laurentian area. Still other lakes rest in rock basins\r\nscooped out by glaciers. In many cases lakes are due to more than\r\none cause, as where preglacial valleys have both been basined by\r\nthe ice and blockaded by its moraines. The Finger lakes of New\r\nYork, for example, occupy such glacial troughs.\r\n\r\nMassive TERMINAL MORAINES, which mark the farthest limits to which\r\nthe Wisconsin ice advanced, have been traced from Cape Cod and the\r\nislands south of New England, across the Appalachians and the\r\nMississippi valley, through the Dakotas, and far to the north over\r\nthe plains of British America. Where the ice halted for a time in\r\nits general retreat, it left RECESSIONAL MORAINES, as this variety\r\nof the terminal moraine is called. The moraines of the Wisconsin\r\ndrift lie upon the country like great festoons, each series of\r\nconcentric loops marking the utmost advance of broad lobes of the\r\nice margin and the various pauses in their recession.\r\n\r\nBehind the terminal moraines lie wide till plains, in places\r\nstudded thickly with drumlins, or ridged with an occasional esker.\r\nGreat outwash plains of sand and gravel lie in front of the\r\nmoraine belts, and long valley trains of coarse gravels tell of\r\nthe swift and powerful rivers of the time.\r\n\r\nTHE LOESS OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. A yellow earth, quite like\r\nthe loess of China, is laid broadly as a surface deposit over the\r\nMississippi valley from eastern Nebraska to Ohio outside the\r\nboundaries of the Iowan and the Wisconsin drift. Much of the loess\r\nwas deposited in Iowan times. It is younger than the earlier drift\r\nsheets, for it overlies their weathered and eroded surfaces. It\r\nthickens to the Iowan drift border, but is not found upon that\r\ndrift. It is older than the Wisconsin, for in many places it\r\npasses underneath the Wisconsin terminal moraines. In part the\r\nloess seems to have been washed from glacial waste and spread in\r\nsluggish glacial waters, and in part to have been distributed by\r\nthe wind from plains of aggrading glacial streams.\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECTS OF THE ICE INVASIONS ON RIVERS. The repeated ice\r\ninvasions of the Pleistocene profoundly disarranged the drainage\r\nsystems of our northern states. In some regions the ancient\r\nvalleys were completely filled with drift. On the withdrawal of\r\nthe ice the streams were compelled to find their way, as best they\r\ncould, over a fresh land surface, where we now find them flowing\r\non the drift in young, narrow channels. But hundreds of feet below\r\nthe ground the well driller and the prospector for coal and oil\r\ndiscover deep, wide, buried valleys cut in rock,--the channels of\r\npreglacial and interglacial streams. In places the ancient valleys\r\nwere filled with drift to a depth of a hundred feet, and sometimes\r\neven to a depth of four hundred and five hundred feet. In such\r\nvalleys, rivers now flow high above their ancient beds of rock on\r\nfloors of valley drift. Many of the valleys of our present rivers\r\nare but patchworks of preglacial, interglacial, and postglacial\r\ncourses (Fig. 366). Here the river winds along an ancient valley\r\nwith gently sloping sides and a wide alluvial floor perhaps a mile\r\nor so in width, and there it enters a young, rock-walled gorge,\r\nwhose rocky bed may be crossed by ledges over which the river\r\nplunges in waterfalls and rapids.\r\n\r\nIn such cases it is possible that the river was pushed to one side\r\nof its former valley by a lobe of ice, and compelled to cut a new\r\nchannel in the adjacent uplands. A section of the valley may have\r\nbeen blockaded with morainic waste, and the lake formed behind the\r\nbarrier may have found outlet over the country to one side of the\r\nancient drift-filled valley. In some instances it would seem that\r\nduring the waning of the ice sheets, glacial streams, while\r\nconfined within walls of stagnant ice, cut down through the ice\r\nand incised their channels on the underlying country, in some\r\ncases being let down on old river courses, and in other cases\r\nexcavating gorges in adjacent uplands.\r\n\r\nPLEISTOCENE LAKES. Temporary lakes were formed wherever the ice\r\nfront dammed the natural drainage of the region. Some, held in the\r\nminor valleys crossed by ice lobes, were small, and no doubt many\r\nwere too short-lived to leave lasting records. Others, long held\r\nagainst the northward sloping country by the retreating ice edge,\r\nleft in their beaches their clayey beds, and their outlet channels\r\npermanent evidences of their area and depth. Some of these glacial\r\nlakes are thus known to have been larger than any present lake.\r\n\r\nLake Agassiz, named in honor of the author of the theory of\r\ncontinental glaciation, is supposed to have been held by the\r\nunited front of the Keewatin and the Labrador ice fields as they\r\nfinally retreated down the valley of the Red River of the North\r\nand the drainage basin of Lake Winnipeg. From first to last Lake\r\nAgassiz covered a hundred and ten thousand square miles in\r\nManitoba and the adjacent parts of Minnesota and North Dakota,--an\r\narea larger than all the Great Lakes combined. It discharged its\r\nwaters across the divide which held it on the south, and thus\r\nexcavated the valley of the Minnesota River. The lake bed--a plain\r\nof till--was spread smooth and level as a floor with lacustrine\r\nsilts. Since Lake Agassiz vanished with the melting back of the\r\nice beyond the outlet by the Nelson River into Hudson Bay, there\r\nhas gathered on its floor a deep humus, rich in the nitrogenous\r\nelements so needful for the growth of plants, and it is to this\r\nsoil that the region owes its well-known fertility.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT LAKES. The basins of the Great Lakes are broad\r\npreglacial river valleys, warped by movements of the crust still\r\nin progress, enlarged by the erosive action of lobes of the\r\ncontinental ice sheets, and blockaded by their drift. The\r\ncomplicated glacial and postglacial history of the lakes is\r\nrecorded in old strand lines which have been traced at various\r\nheights about them, showing their areas and the levels at which\r\ntheir waters stood at different times.\r\n\r\nWith the retreat of the lobate Wisconsin ice sheet toward the\r\nnorth and east, the southern and western ends of the basins of the\r\nGreat Lakes were uncovered first; and here, between the receding\r\nice front and the slopes of land which faced it, lakes gathered\r\nwhich increased constantly in size.\r\n\r\nThe lake which thus came to occupy the western end of the Lake\r\nSuperior basin discharged over the divide at Duluth down the St.\r\nCroix River, as an old outlet channel proves; that which held the\r\nsouthern end of the basin of Lake Michigan sent its overflow\r\nacross the divide at Chicago via the Illinois River to the\r\nMississippi; the lake which covered the lowlands about the western\r\nend of Lake Erie discharged its waters at Fort Wayne into the\r\nWabash River.\r\n\r\nThe ice still blocked the Mohawk and St. Lawrence valleys on the\r\neast, while on the west it had retreated far to the north. The\r\nlakes become confluent in wide expanses of water, whose depths and\r\nmargins, as shown by their old lake beaches, varied at different\r\ntimes with the position of the confining ice and with warpings of\r\nthe land. These vast water bodies, which at one or more periods\r\nwere greater than all the Great Lakes combined, discharged at\r\nvarious times across the divide at Chicago, near Syracuse, New\r\nYork, down the Mohawk valley, and by a channel from Georgian Bay\r\ninto the Ottawa River. Last of all the present outlet by the St.\r\nLawrence was established.\r\n\r\nThe beaches of the glacial lakes just mentioned are now far from\r\nhorizontal. That of the lake which occupied the Ontario basin has\r\nan elevation of three hundred and sixty-two feet above tide at the\r\nwest and of six hundred and seventy-five feet at the northeast,\r\nproving here a differential movement of the land since glacial\r\ntimes amounting to more than three hundred feet. The beaches which\r\nmark the successive heights of these glacial lakes are not\r\nparallel; hence the warping began before the Glacial epoch closed.\r\nWe have already seen that the canting of the region is still in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nTHE CHAMPLAIN SUBSIDENCE. As the Glacial epoch approached its end,\r\nand the Labrador ice field melted back for the last time to near\r\nits source, the land on which the ice had lain in eastern North\r\nAmerica was so depressed that the sea now spread far and wide up\r\nthe St. Lawrence valley. It joined with Lake Ontario, and\r\nextending down the Champlain and Hudson valleys, made an island of\r\nNew England and the maritime provinces of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe proofs of this subsidence are found in old sea beaches and\r\nsea-laid clays resting on Wisconsin till. At Montreal such\r\nterraces are found six hundred and twenty feet above sea level,\r\nand along Lake Champlain--where the skeleton of a whale was once\r\nfound among them--at from five hundred to four hundred feet. The\r\nheavy delta which the Mohawk River built at its mouth in this arm\r\nof the sea now stands something more than three hundred feet above\r\nsea level. The clays of the Champlain subsidence pass under water\r\nnear the mouth of the Hudson, and in northern New Jersey they\r\noccur two hundred feet below tide. In these elevations we have\r\nmeasures of the warping of the region since glacial times.\r\n\r\nTHE WESTERN UNITED STATES IN GLACIAL TIMES. The western United\r\nStates was not covered during the Pleistocene by any general ice\r\nsheet, but all the high ranges were capped with permanent snow and\r\nnourished valley glaciers, often many times the size of the\r\nexisting glaciers of the Alps. In almost every valley of the\r\nSierras and the Rockies the records of these vanished ice streams\r\nmay be found in cirques, glacial troughs, roches moutonnecs, and\r\nmorainic deposits.\r\n\r\nIt was during the Glacial epoch that Lakes Bonneville and Lahontan\r\nwere established in the Great Basin, whose climate must then have\r\nbeen much more moist than now.\r\n\r\nTHE DRIFTLESS AREA. In the upper Mississippi valley there is an\r\narea of about ten thousand square miles in southwestern Wisconsin\r\nand the adjacent parts of Iowa and Minnesota, which escaped the\r\nice invasions. The rocks are covered with residual clays, the\r\nproduct of long preglacial weathering. The region is an ancient\r\npeneplain, uplifted and dissected in late Tertiary times, with\r\nmature valleys whose gentle gradients are unbroken by waterfalls\r\nand rapids. Thus the driftless area is in strong contrast with the\r\nimmature drift topography about it, where lakes and waterfalls are\r\ncommon. It is a bit of preglacial landscape, showing the condition\r\nof the entire region before the Glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nThe driftless area lay to one side of the main track of both the\r\nKeewatin and the Labrador ice fields, and at the north it was\r\nprotected by the upland south of Lake Superior, which weakened and\r\nretarded the movement of the ice.\r\n\r\nSouth of the driftless area the Mississippi valley was invaded at\r\ndifferent times by ice sheets from the west,--the Kansan and the\r\nIowan,--and again by the Illinoian ice sheet from the east. Again\r\nand again the Mississippi River was pushed to one side or the\r\nother of its path. The ancient channel which it held along the\r\nIllinoian ice front has been traced through southeastern Iowa for\r\nmany miles.\r\n\r\nBENEFITS OF GLACIATION. Like the driftless area, the preglacial\r\nsurface over which the ice advanced seems to have been well\r\ndissected after the late Tertiary uplifts, and to have been carved\r\nin many places to steep valley slopes and rugged hills. The\r\nretreating ice sheets, which left smooth plains and gently rolling\r\ncountry over the wide belt where glacial deposition exceeded\r\nglacial erosion, have made travel and transportation easier than\r\nthey otherwise would have been.\r\n\r\nThe preglacial subsoils were residual clays and sands, composed\r\nof the insoluble elements of the country rock of the locality,\r\nwith some minglings of its soluble parts still undissolved. The\r\nglacial subsoils are made of rocks of many kinds, still undecayed\r\nand largely ground to powder. They thus contain an inexhaustible\r\nstore of the mineral foods of plants, and in a form\r\nmade easily ready for plant use.\r\n\r\nOn the preglacial hillsides the humus layer must have been\r\ncomparatively thin, while the broad glacial plains have gathered\r\ndeep black soils, rich in carbon and nitrogen taken from the\r\natmosphere. To these soils and subsoils a large part of the wealth\r\nand prosperity of the glaciated regions of our country must be\r\nattributed.\r\n\r\nThe ice invasions have also added very largely to the water power\r\nof the country. The rivers which in preglacial times were flowing\r\nover graded courses for the most part, were pushed from their old\r\nvalleys and set to flow on higher levels, where they have\r\ndeveloped waterfalls and rapids. This power will probably be fully\r\nutilized long before the coal beds of the country are exhausted,\r\nand will become one of the chief sources of the national wealth.\r\n\r\nTHE RECENT EPOCH. The deposits laid since glacial times graduate\r\ninto those now forming along the ocean shores, on lake beds, and\r\nin river valleys. Slow and comparatively slight changes, such as\r\nthe warpings of the region of the Great Lakes, have brought about\r\nthe geographical conditions of the present. The physical history\r\nof the Recent epoch needs here no special mention.\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF THE QUATERNARY\r\n\r\nDuring the entire Quaternary, invertebrates and plants suffered\r\nlittle change in species,--so slowly are these ancient and\r\ncomparatively simple organisms modified. The Mammalia, on the\r\nother hand, have changed much since the beginning of Quaternary\r\ntime: the various species of the present have been evolved, and\r\nsome lines have become extinct. These highly organized vertebrates\r\nare evidently less stable than are lower types of animals, and\r\nrespond more rapidly to changes in the environment.\r\n\r\nPLEISTOCENE MAMMALS. In the Pleistocene the Mammalia reached their\r\nculmination both in size and in variety of forms, and were\r\nsuperior in both these respects to the mammals of to-day. In\r\nPleistocene times in North America there were several species of\r\nbison,--one whose widespreading horns were ten feet from tip to\r\ntip,--a gigantic moose elk, a giant rodent (Castoroides) five feet\r\nlong, several species of musk oxen, several species of horses,--\r\nmore akin, however, to zebras than to the modern horse,--a huge\r\nlion, several saber-tooth tigers, immense edentates of several\r\ngenera, and largest of all the mastodon and mammoth.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the edentates was the Megatherium, a. clumsy ground\r\nsloth bigger than a rhinoceros. The bones of the Megatherium are\r\nextraordinarily massive,--the thigh bone being thrice as thick as\r\nthat of an elephant,--and the animal seems to have been well able\r\nto get its living by overthrowing trees and stripping off their\r\nleaves. The Glyptodon was a mailed edentate, eight feet long,\r\nresembling the little armadillo. These edentates survived from\r\nTertiary times, and in the warmer stages of the Pleistocene ranged\r\nnorth as far as Ohio and Oregon.\r\n\r\nThe great proboscidians of the Glacial epoch were about the size\r\nof modern elephants, and somewhat smaller than their ancestral\r\nspecies in the Pliocene. The MASTODON ranged over all North\r\nAmerica south of Hudson Bay, but had become extinct in the Old\r\nWorld at the end of the Tertiary. The elephants were represented\r\nby the MAMMOTH, which roamed in immense herds from our middle\r\nstates to Alaska, and from Arctic Asia to the Mediterranean and\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nIt is an oft-told story how about a century ago, near the Lena\r\nRiver in Siberia, there was found the body of a mammoth which had\r\nbeen safely preserved in ice for thousands of years, how the flesh\r\nwas eaten by dogs and bears, and how the eyes and hoofs and\r\nportions of the hide were taken with the skeleton to St.\r\nPetersburg. Since then several other carcasses of the mammoth,\r\nsimilarly preserved in ice, have been found in the same region,--\r\none as recently as 1901. We know from these remains that the\r\nanimal was clothed in a coat of long, coarse hair, with thick\r\nbrown fur beneath.\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS. The distribution of\r\nspecies in the Glacial epoch was far different from that of the\r\npresent. In the glacial stages arctic species ranged south into\r\nwhat are now temperate latitudes. The walrus throve along the\r\nshores of Virginia and the musk ox grazed in Iowa and Kentucky. In\r\nEurope the reindeer and arctic fox reached the Pyrenees. During\r\nthe Champlain depression arctic shells lived along the shore of\r\nthe arm of the sea which covered the St. Lawrence valley. In\r\ninterglacial times of milder climate the arctic fauna-flora\r\nretreated, and their places were taken by plants and animals from\r\nthe south. Peccaries, now found in Texas, ranged into Michigan and\r\nNew York, while great sloths from South America reached the middle\r\nstates. Interglacial beds at Toronto, Canada, contain remains of\r\nforests of maple, elm, and papaw, with mollusks now living in the\r\nMississippi basin.\r\n\r\nWhat changes in the forests of your region would be brought about,\r\nand in what way, if the climate should very gradually grow colder?\r\nWhat changes if it should grow warmer?\r\n\r\nOn the Alps and the highest summits of the White Mountains of New\r\nEngland are found colonies of arctic species of plants and\r\ninsects. How did they come to be thus separated from their home\r\nbeyond the arctic circle by a thousand miles and more of temperate\r\nclimate impossible to cross?\r\n\r\nMAN. Along with the remains of the characteristic animals of the\r\ntime which are now extinct there have been found in deposits of\r\nthe Glacial epoch in the Old World relics of Pleistocene MAN, his\r\nbones, and articles of his manufacture. In Europe, where they have\r\nbest been studied, human relics occur chiefly in peat bogs, in\r\nloess, in caverns where man made his home, and in high river\r\nterraces sometimes eighty and a hundred feet above the present\r\nflood plains of the streams.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the development of early man, we should\r\nknow that prehistoric peoples are ranked according to the\r\nmaterials of which their tools were made and the skill shown in\r\ntheir manufacture. There are thus four well-marked stages of human\r\nculture preceding the written annals of history:\r\n\r\n    4 The Iron stage.\r\n    3 The Bronze stage.\r\n    2 The Neolithic (recent stone) stage.\r\n    1 The Paleolithic (ancient stone) stage.\r\n\r\nIn the Neolithic stage the use of the metals had not yet been\r\nlearned, but tools of stone were carefully shaped and polished. To\r\nthis stage the North American Indian belonged at the time of the\r\ndiscovery of the continent. In the Paleolithic stage, stone\r\nimplements were chipped to rude shapes and left unpolished. This,\r\nthe lowest state of human culture, has been outgrown by nearly\r\nevery savage tribe now on earth. A still earlier stage may once\r\nhave existed, when man had not learned so much as to shape his\r\nweapons to his needs, but used chance pebbles and rock splinters\r\nin their natural forms; of such a stage, however, we have no\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nPALEOLITHIC MAN IN EUROPE. It was to the Paleolithic stage that\r\nthe earliest men belonged whose relics are found in Europe. They\r\nhad learned to knock off two-edged flakes from flint pebbles, and\r\nto work them into simple weapons. The great discovery had been\r\nmade that fire could be kindled and made use of, as the charcoal\r\nand the stones discolored by heat of their ancient hearths attest.\r\nCaves and shelters beneath overhanging cliffs were their homes or\r\ncamping places. Paleolithic man was a savage of the lowest type,\r\nwho lived by hunting the wild beasts of the time.\r\n\r\nSkeletons found in certain caves in Belgium and France represent\r\nperhaps the earliest race yet found in Europe. These short, broad-\r\nshouldered men, muscular, with bent knees and stooping gait, low-\r\nbrowed and small of brain, were of little intelligence and yet\r\ntruly human.\r\n\r\nThe remains of Pleistocene man are naturally found either in\r\ncaverns, where they escaped destruction by the ice sheets, or in\r\ndeposits outside the glaciated area. In both cases it is extremely\r\ndifficult, or quite impossible, to assign the remains to definite\r\nglacial or interglacial times. Their relative age is best told by\r\nthe fauna with which they are associated. Thus the oldest relics\r\nof man are found with the animals of the late Tertiary or early\r\nQuaternary, such as a species of hippopotamus and an elephant more\r\nancient than the mammoth. Later in age are the remains found along\r\nwith the mammoth, cave bear and cave hyena, and other animals of\r\nglacial time which are now extinct; while more recent still are\r\nthose associated with the reindeer, which in the last ice invasion\r\nroamed widely with the mammoth over central Europe.\r\n\r\nTHE CAVES OF SOUTHERN FRANCE. These contain the fullest records of\r\nthe race, much like the Eskimos in bodily frame, which lived in\r\nwestern Europe at the time of the mammoth and the reindeer. The\r\nfloors of these caves are covered with a layer of bone fragments,\r\nthe remains of many meals, and here are found also various\r\narticles of handicraft. In this way we know that the savages who\r\nmade these caves their homes fished with harpoons of bone, and\r\nhunted with spears and darts tipped with flint and horn. The\r\nlarger bones are split for the extraction of the marrow. Among\r\nsuch fragments no split human bones are found; this people,\r\ntherefore, were not cannibals. Bone needles imply the art of\r\nsewing, and therefore the use of clothing, made no doubt of skins;\r\nwhile various ornaments, such as necklaces of shells, show how\r\nancient is the love of personal adornment. Pottery was not yet\r\ninvented. There is no sign of agriculture. No animals had yet been\r\ndomesticated; not even man's earliest friend, the dog. Certain\r\nimplements, perhaps used as the insignia of office, suggest a rude\r\ntribal organization and the beginnings of the state. The remains\r\nof funeral feasts in front of caverns used as tombs point to a\r\nreligion and the belief in a life beyond the grave. In the caverns\r\nof southern France are found also the beginnings of the arts of\r\npainting and of sculpture. With surprising skill these Paleolithic\r\nmen sketched on bits of ivory the mammoth with his long hair and\r\nhuge curved tusks, frescoed their cavern walls with pictures of\r\nthe bison and other animals, and carved reindeer on their dagger\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nEARLY MAN ON OTHER CONTINENTS. Paleolithic flints curiously like\r\nthose of western Europe are found also in many regions of the Old\r\nWorld,--in India, Egypt, and Asia Minor,--beneath the earliest\r\nvestiges of the civilization of those ancient seats, and sometimes\r\nassociated with the fauna of the Glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nIn Java there were found in 1891, in strata early Quaternary or\r\nlate Pliocene in age, parts of a skeleton of lower grade, if not\r\nof greater antiquity, than any human remains now known.\r\nPithecanthropus erectus, as the creature has been named, walked\r\nerect, as its thigh bone shows, but the skull and teeth indicate a\r\nclose affinity with the ape.\r\n\r\nIn North America there have been reported many finds of human\r\nrelics in valley trains, loess, old river gravels buried beneath\r\nlava flows, and other deposits of supposed glacial age; but in the\r\nopinion of some geologists sufficient proof of the existence of\r\nman in America in glacial times has not as yet been found.\r\n\r\nThese finds in North America have been discredited for various\r\nreasons. Some were not made by scientific men accustomed to the\r\nclosest scrutiny of every detail. Some were reported after a\r\nnumber of years, when the circumstances might not be accurately\r\nremembered; while in a number of instances it seems possible that\r\nthe relics might have been worked into glacial deposits by natural\r\ncauses from the surface.\r\n\r\nMan, we may believe, witnessed the great ice fields of Europe, if\r\nnot of America, and perhaps appeared on earth under the genial\r\nclimate of preglacial times. Nothing has yet been found of the\r\nline of man's supposed descent from the primates of the early\r\nTertiary, with the possible exception of the Java remains just\r\nmentioned. The structures of man's body show that he is not\r\ndescended from any of the existing genera of apes. And although he\r\nmay not have been exempt from the law of evolution,--that method\r\nof creation which has made all life on earth akin,--yet his\r\nappearance was an event which in importance ranks with the advent\r\nof life upon the planet, and marks a new manifestation of creative\r\nenergy upon a higher plane. There now appeared intelligence,\r\nreason, a moral nature, and a capacity for self-directed progress\r\nsuch as had never been before on earth.\r\n\r\nTHE RECENT EPOCH. The Glacial epoch ends with the melting of the\r\nice sheets of North America and Europe, and the replacement of the\r\nPleistocene mammalian fauna by present species. How gradually the\r\none epoch shades into the other is seen in the fact that the\r\nglaciers which still linger in Norway and Alaska are the lineal\r\ndescendants or the renewed appearances of the ice fields of\r\nglacial times.\r\n\r\nOur science cannot foretell whether all traces of the Great Ice\r\nAge are to disappear, and the earth is to enjoy again the genial\r\nclimate of the Tertiary, or whether the present is an interglacial\r\nepoch and the northern lands are comparatively soon again to be\r\nwrapped in ice.\r\n\r\nNEOLITHIC MAN. The wild Paleolithic men vanished from Europe with\r\nthe wild beasts which they hunted, and their place was taken by\r\ntribes, perhaps from Asia, of a higher culture. The remains of\r\nNeolithic man are found, much as are those of the North American\r\nIndians, upon or near the surface, in burial mounds, in shell\r\nheaps (the refuse heaps of their settlements), in peat bogs,\r\ncaves, recent flood-plain deposits, and in the beds of lakes near\r\nshore where they sometimes built their dwellings upon piles.\r\n\r\nThe successive stages in European culture are well displayed in\r\nthe peat bogs of Denmark. The lowest layers contain the polished\r\nSTONE implements of Neolithic man, along with remains of the\r\nSCOTCH FIR. Above are OAK trunks with implements of BRONZE, while\r\nthe higher layers hold iron weapons and the remains of a BEECH\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nNeolithic man in Europe had learned to make pottery, to spin and\r\nweave linen, to hew timbers and build boats, and to grow wheat and\r\nbarley. The dog, horse, ox, sheep, goat, and hog had been\r\ndomesticated, and, as these species are not known to have existed\r\nbefore in Europe, it is a fair inference that they were brought by\r\nman from another continent of the Old World. Neolithic man knew\r\nnothing of the art of extracting the metals from their ores, nor\r\nhad he a written language.\r\n\r\nThe Neolithic stage of culture passes by insensible gradations\r\ninto that of the age of bronze, and thus into the Recent epoch.\r\n\r\nIn the Recent epoch the progress of man in language, in social\r\norganization, in the arts of life, in morals and religion, has\r\nleft ample records which are for other sciences than ours to read;\r\nhere, therefore, geology gives place to archaeology and history.\r\n\r\nOur brief study of the outlines of geology has given us, it is\r\nhoped, some great and lasting good. To conceive a past so\r\ndifferent from the present has stimulated the imagination, and to\r\nfollow the inferences by which the conclusions of our science have\r\nbeen reached has exercised one of the noblest faculties of the\r\nmind,--the reason. We have learned to look on nature in new ways:\r\nevery landscape, every pebble now has a meaning and tells\r\nsomething of its origin and history, while plants and animals have\r\na closer interest since we have traced the long lines of their\r\ndescent. The narrow horizons of human life have been broken\r\nthrough, and we have caught glimpses of that immeasurable reach of\r\ntime in which nebulae and suns and planets run their courses.\r\nMoreover, we have learned something of that orderly and world-\r\nembracing progress by which the once uninhabitable globe has come\r\nto be man's well-appointed home, and life appearing in the\r\nlowliest forms has steadily developed higher and still higher\r\ntypes. Seeing this process enter human history and lift our race\r\ncontinually to loftier levels, we find reason to believe that the\r\nonward, upward movement of the geological past is the\r\nmanifestation of the same wise Power which makes for righteousness\r\nand good and that this unceasing purpose will still lead on to\r\nnobler ends.",
