Their backs were towards him; they\r\nhad either not heard, or were disinclined to notice what he had said.\r\n\r\n'Ay, 'twas twenty-six year ago,' he resumed, in a voice like the note of\r\nan organ pipe.  'We was working between Brisbane and the Solomons,\r\nblackbirding and what not; 'twas before your time, young gents, but----'\r\n\r\n'What's that you 're saying?' demanded one of the two whose backs he had\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\n'I was saying, sir, as how I was in a fix like this 'ere twenty-seven\r\nyear ago, or it may be twenty-eight: Ephraim's got the head for figures.\r\nWe was working between Brisbane and the Carolines--a tight little\r\nschooner she was, light on her heels.  You can bear me out, Ephraim?'\r\n\r\n'If so be 'twas the same craft, light and tight she was,' Ephraim\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\n'Well, a tidal wave come along and pitched her clean on to a beach like\r\nas this might be--not a beach as you could respect, with bathing-boxes\r\nand a promenade, but a narrow strip of a beach, a reg'lar fraud of a\r\nbeach, under cliffs as high as a church...'\r\n\r\n'Say, Grinson, get a move on,' drawled the second of the two younger\r\nmen.  'What about your beach?  How does it help us, anyway?'\r\n\r\n'Well, look at the difference, sir.  There we was: schooner gone to\r\npieces, a score of us cast ashore, three of us white men, the rest\r\nKanakas.  'Tis thirty years since, but the recollection of them awful\r\ndays gives me the 'orrors.  My two white mates--the Kanakas ate 'em,\r\nbeing 'ungry.  I drops a veil over that 'orrible tragedy.  Being about a\r\nyard less in the waist than I am to-day, I was nimble as a monkey, and\r\nwent up those cliffs like greased lightning, broke off chunks of rock\r\nweighing anything up to half a ton, and pitched 'em down on the Kanakas\r\nscrambling up after me, panting for my gore. For three days and nights I\r\nkept 'em at bay, and my arms got so used to flinging down rocks that\r\nwhen I was rescued by a boat's crew from a Dutch schooner they kept on\r\na-working regular as a pendulum, and they had to put me in a strait\r\njacket till I was run down.  You can bear me out, Ephraim, me lad?'\r\n\r\n'I can't exactly remember all them particlers, Mr. Grinson, but truth 's\r\ntruth, and 'tis true ye 've led a wonderful life, and stranger things\r\nhave happened to ye--that I will say on my oath.'\r\n\r\n'You were one of the two that were eaten, I suppose?' said the young man\r\nwho had first spoken, eyeing Ephraim with a quizzical smile.\r\n\r\n'Gee!  That's the part Grinson dropped a veil over,' said the other.\r\n'What's the moral of your pretty fairy story, Grinson?'\r\n\r\n'Moral, sir?  'Tis plain.'  He opened his brass tobacco-box, and\r\ndeliberately twisted up another quid.  Then he said impressively: 'Dog\r\ndon't eat dog; otherways we 're all white men, and there 's no Kanakas.'\r\n\r\nPhil Trentham laughed, a little ruefully.\r\n\r\n'We may have to eat each other yet,' he said.  Then, waving his arms\r\ntowards the cliffs, he added: 'The prospect doesn't please--what do you\r\nmake of it?'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation in which the four men found themselves had certainly no\r\nelement of cheerfulness.  They were the sole survivors from a tramp\r\nsteamer which, on the previous day, had fallen a prey to a German\r\nraider.  After a night's tossing in their small open boat, they had been\r\ncast up on this unknown shore, and when they examined the craft,\r\nmarvelled that they escaped with their lives.  Collision with a rock\r\nthat just peeped above the breakers some fifty yards out had stove, in\r\nher garboard-strakes, a hole through which a man might creep.  Luckily,\r\nthe bag of ship's biscuits, which, with a keg of water, formed their\r\nwhole stock of provisions, had not been washed out or injured.\r\n\r\nBut what of the future?  The narrow strip of sandy beach on which they\r\nhad been thrown stretched along the foot of high precipitous cliffs that\r\nshowed a concave arc to the sea.  At each horn a rocky headland jutted\r\nfar out, its base washed high by the waves.  The cliffs were rugged and\r\nappeared unscalable, even with the aid of the tufts of vegetation that\r\nsprouted here and there from fissures in their weather-beaten face.  It\r\nseemed that they were shut in between the cliffs and the sea, penned\r\nbetween the headlands, confined to this strip of sand, perhaps two miles\r\nlong, from which there was apparently no landward exit.  Their boat was\r\nunseaworthy; there was no way of escape by land or sea.\r\n\r\nPhil Trentham, working copra on a remote island of the South Pacific,\r\nhad learnt of the outbreak of war some months after the event, and taken\r\npassage on the first steamer that called, intending to land at the\r\nnearest port and thence to make his way to some centre of enlistment.\r\nAmong the few passengers he had chummed up with a young fellow about his\r\nown age--one Gordon P. Hoole, who hailed from Cincinnati, had plenty of\r\nmoney, and was touring the Pacific Islands in tramp steamers for\r\namusement.  Each was in his twentieth year, stood about five feet ten,\r\nand wore a suit of ducks and a cowboy hat; there the likeness between\r\nthem ended.  Trentham was fair, Hoole dark.  The former had full ruddy\r\ncheeks, broad shoulders, and massive arms and calves; the latter was\r\nlean and rather sallow, more wiry than muscular. Trentham parted his\r\nhair; Hoole's rose erect from his brow like a short thick thatch. Both\r\nhad firm lips and jaws, and their eyes, unlike in colour, were keen with\r\nintelligence and quick with humour.\r\n\r\nTheir two companions in misfortune presented an odd contrast to them and\r\nto each other.  Josiah Grinson, forty-eight years of age, was five feet\r\nsix in height, immensely broad, with a girth of nearly sixty inches,\r\narms as thick as an average man's legs, and legs like an elephant's.\r\nHis broad, deeply bronzed face, in the midst of which a small nose, over\r\na long clean upper lip, looked strangely disproportionate, was fringed\r\nwith a thick mass of wiry black hair.  Little eyes of steely blue gazed\r\nout upon the world with a hard unwinking stare.  He wore a dirty white\r\nsweater, much-patched blue trousers, and long boots.  His big voice was\r\nsomewhat monotonous in intonation, and he had been known to doze in the\r\nmiddle of a sentence, wake up and continue without a flaw in the\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nEphraim Meek, who had been mate to Grinson's boatswain for about a\r\nquarter of a century, was a head taller, but lost the advantage of his\r\ninches through a forward stoop of his gaunt frame.  Where Grinson was\r\nconvex Meek was concave.  His hollow cheeks were covered with\r\nstraggling, mouse-coloured hair; his long thin nose made him look more\r\ninquisitive than he really was; his faded grey eyes, slightly asquint,\r\nseemed to be drawn as by a magnet to the countenance of his superior.\r\nMeek was a whole-hearted admirer of the boatswain, and their long\r\nassociation was marred by only one thing--a perpetual struggle between\r\nMeek's personal devotion and his conscientious regard for veracity. No\r\none knew what pangs Grinson's frequent appeals to 'Ephraim, me lad,' to\r\n'bear him out' cost the anxious man.  But he had always managed to\r\nsatisfy the boatswain without undue violence to his own scruples, and\r\nGrinson had never felt the strain.\r\n\r\n\r\n'What do I make of it?' repeated Hoole.  'Nix!'\r\n\r\n'Where do you suppose we are, Grinson?' asked Trentham.\r\n\r\n'I ain't good at supposing, sir, but I know we 're somewheres on the\r\nnorth coast of New Guinea,' Grinson replied.  'Which I mean to say it's\r\ninhabited by cannibals, and I was nearly eat once myself.  'Twas twenty\r\nor maybe twenty-one years ago, when----'\r\n\r\n'By and by, Grinson,' interrupted Trentham. 'It's a gruesome story, no\r\ndoubt, and we 'll fumigate it with our last go-to-bed pipe.'\r\n\r\n'Just so,' Hoole put in.  'I guess we 'd better explore.  It don't feel\r\ngood on this beach.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly.  To save time we 'd better split up.  You take Grinson and\r\ngo one way; I 'll go the other with Meek.  Whoever sees a way up the\r\ncliffs, signal to the others.'\r\n\r\nThey paired off, and walked in opposite directions along the sand.  A\r\nline of seaweed some thirty feet from the cliffs indicated high-water\r\nmark, and relieved them of any fear of being engulfed by the tide.\r\n\r\nTrentham and Meek had struck off to the west, and as they went along\r\nthey scanned the rugged face of the cliffs for a place where it would be\r\npossible to scale them.  For nearly half a mile they roamed on in\r\nsilence; Meek was one of those persons who do not invite conversation.\r\nThen, however, the seaman came to a halt.\r\n\r\n'I wouldn't swear to it, sir,' he said in his deprecating way, 'but if\r\nyou 'll slew your eyes a point or two off the cliffs, I do believe you\r\n'll see the stump of a mast.'\r\n\r\nHe raised his lank hand and pointed.\r\n\r\n'That won't help us much,' said Trentham, looking towards a pocket of\r\nsand some distance above high-water mark, and surrounded by straggling\r\nbushes.  'We can't sail off in a wreck.'\r\n\r\n'That's true as gospel, sir, but it came into my mind, like, that where\r\nthere 's a mast there 's a hull, and p'r'aps it 'll give us a doss-house\r\nfor the night.'\r\n\r\n'It 'll be choked with sand.  Still, we 'll have a look at it.'\r\n\r\nThey walked towards the spot where four or five feet of a jagged mast\r\nstood up apparently from the embedding sand.  As they emerged from the\r\nsurrounding bushes they discovered parts of the bulwarks projecting a\r\nfew inches above a mound of silted-up sand, a little higher than their\r\nheads.  Clambering up the easiest slope, and stepping over the rotting\r\nwoodwork, Trentham gave a low whistle of surprise.\r\n\r\n'Come up and have a look at this, Meek,' he said to the man standing in\r\nhis bent-kneed attitude below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'COME UP AND HAVE A LOOK AT THIS, MEEK.']\r\n\r\nMeek came to his side, and drew his fingers through his thin whiskers as\r\nhe contemplated the scene before him.  Then he turned his eyes on\r\nTrentham, and from him to the cliffs and the beach around.\r\n\r\n'Rum, sir!' he ejaculated.  'Uncommon rum!'\r\n\r\nWhile the greater part of the vessel was deep in sand, a certain area of\r\nthe deck around the base of the mast was covered with only a thin layer,\r\nthrough which the iron ring of a hatch was clearly visible.  On all\r\nsides of it the sand appeared to have been cleared away, and heaped up\r\nlike a regular rampart.\r\n\r\n'Some one has been here, and not so long ago,' said Trentham.  'It's\r\ncertainly queer. See if you can lift the hatch; we may as well go\r\nbelow.'\r\n\r\nMeek hesitated.\r\n\r\n'If so be there 's cannibals----' he began.\r\n\r\n'Nonsense!  They wouldn't be stifling under hatches.'\r\n\r\n'Or maybe dead corpses or skellingtons.'\r\n\r\n'Come, pull up the hatch; I 'll go down first.'\r\n\r\nBrushing away the thin covering of sand, Meek seized the ring and\r\nheaved.  The hatch came up so easily that he almost lost his balance.\r\n\r\n'The stairway 's quite sound,' said Trentham, peering into the depths.\r\n'Stand by!'\r\n\r\nHe stepped upon the companion, and descended.  In a few seconds Meek\r\nheard the striking of a match, and Trentham's voice ringing out of the\r\nvault.\r\n\r\n'Come down, Meek; there are no skeletons.'\r\n\r\nMeek looked around timorously, sighed, and went slowly down the ladder.\r\nTrentham had just struck another match, and was holding it aloft.  The\r\nflame disclosed a small cabin, the floor space almost filled with a\r\nmassive table and three chairs of antique make, all of dark oak.  Upon\r\nthe table lay an old sextant, a long leather-bound telescope, a large\r\nmug of silver-gilt, heavily chased, a silver spoon, and several smaller\r\nobjects.  On the wall hung a large engraved portrait in a carved oak\r\nframe, representing a stout, hook-nosed, heavily wigged gentleman in\r\neighteenth century costume, with a sash across the shoulder and many\r\nstars and decorations on the breast.\r\n\r\nMeek breathed heavily.  The match went out.\r\n\r\n'I can't afford to use all my matches,' said Trentham.  'Run up and cut\r\na branch from a bush; that'll serve for a torch for the present.  And\r\nsignal to the others.'\r\n\r\n'I don't hardly like to say it, sir, but I 'm afeard as my weak voice\r\nwon't reach so far.'\r\n\r\n'My good man, you 've got long arms. Wave 'em about.  Climb up the mast.\r\nUse your gumption!'\r\n\r\nMeek mounted to the deck, and Trentham smiled as he heard a husky voice\r\nshouting, 'Ahoy!'  After some minutes the man returned with a thick dry\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\n'I give a hail, sir, and flung my arms about frantic, and Mr. Grinson,\r\nhe seed me.  I can't say he heard me, not being sure.  He 've a\r\nwonderful voice himself--wonderful, and I heard him answer as clear as a\r\nbell.'\r\n\r\n'That's all right!' said Trentham, lighting the branch.  'We 've made a\r\ndiscovery, Meek.'\r\n\r\n'Seemingly, sir.  I 'm fair mazed, and that's the truth of it.  Who\r\nmight be the old soldier yonder, and what's he wear that thing on his\r\nhead for?  He ain't a sea captain, that I 'll swear, and I wonder at any\r\nsailor-man sticking up a soldier's picture in his cabin.'\r\n\r\n'You 're quite right, Meek,' replied Trentham, who had been scrutinising\r\nthe portrait. 'The old soldier, as you call him, is a king.'\r\n\r\n'You don't say so, sir!  Where's his crown, then?'\r\n\r\n'Ah, I wonder where!  The poor man lost his crown and his head too.\r\nIt's Louis XVI., King of France a hundred years ago and more. Here it is\r\nin French, below the engraving: \"Engraved after the portrait by\r\nChampfleury.\"  We 're in a French vessel, Meek--the ship of some French\r\nexplorer, no doubt, who was wrecked here goodness knows how many years\r\nago.'\r\n\r\nMeek looked around again, and slightly shivered.\r\n\r\n'I wonder what they did with the bones?' he murmured.\r\n\r\n'What bones?'\r\n\r\n'The cannibals, I mean, sir, when they 'd eat the captain and crew.'\r\n\r\n'You 've a ghastly imagination, Meek.  A question more to the point is,\r\nhow it happens that these things remain here, so well preserved.  There\r\n's very little sand on the floor, as you see; any one would think that\r\nsomebody comes here now and then to tidy up. Would your cannibals do\r\nthat, do you think?'\r\n\r\n'I wouldn't like to say, sir.  I 'll ask Mr. Grinson; he knows 'em,\r\nbeing nearly eat himself.  But I don't know who 'd have a good word for\r\ncannibals.'\r\n\r\n'At any rate, they aren't thieves.  This mug, for instance, is silver\r\ngilt, and of some value; here 's a coat-of-arms engraved on it, and it\r\nmust have been polished not very long ago.  Yes, it has been rubbed with\r\nsand; look at the slight scratches.  I 'm beginning to think rather well\r\nof your cannibals.'\r\n\r\n'Touch wood, sir,' said Meek earnestly. 'I wouldn't say a thing like\r\nthat, not till I knowed.  And as for thieves--well, if a man's bad\r\nenough to eat another man, he 's bad enough to be a thief, and if he\r\nain't a thief, 'tis because he don't know the vally of things. Ignorance\r\nis a terrible unfortunate calamity.'\r\n\r\nA sonorous bellow from above caused Meek to jump.\r\n\r\n'There, now!' he said.  'My head 's full of cannibals, and 'tis Mr.\r\nGrinson.  We 're down below!' he called.\r\n\r\n'Is the place afire?' asked Grinson, sniffing, as he bent his head over\r\nthe hatchway. 'I thought 'twas Mr. Trentham smoking when I seed the\r\nsmoke, but I see you 're disinfecting the cabin, sir, and I don't\r\nwonder.  This 'ere wreck must have been collecting germs a good few\r\nyears.'\r\n\r\n'Come down, Grinson,' said Trentham. 'Where 's Mr. Hoole?'\r\n\r\n'Taking a look up the chimbley, sir.'\r\n\r\n'What chimney?'\r\n\r\n'Well, that's what he called it; for myself I 'd call it a crack.'  He\r\ncame ponderously down the ladder.  'Jiminy!  Ephraim, me lad, you never\r\ntidied up so quick in your life before.'\r\n\r\n'I can't truthfully say as I tidied up, Mr. Grinson,' said Meek.  ''Tis\r\nuncommon tidy for a cabin, that's a fact.'\r\n\r\n'Picters, too!  The master o' this 'ere ship must have been a rum cove!'\r\n\r\n'He was a Frenchman, Mr. Trentham says.'\r\n\r\n'That accounts for it.  I remember a French captain----'\r\n\r\nThe chimney, Grinson,' Trentham interrupted. 'You haven't explained----'\r\n\r\n'True, sir; it was took out of my mind, seeing things what I didn't\r\nexpect.  As we come along, sir, Mr. Hoole he says: \"Ain't that a\r\nchimbley?\"  \"Where?\" says I, not seeing no pot nor cowl.  \"There!\" says\r\nhe, and he points to what I 'd call a long crack in the cliff.'\r\n\r\n'Where is it?'\r\n\r\n'About half a cable length astern, sir.  Mr. Hoole went to have a look\r\nat it.  Here he is!'\r\n\r\n'Phew!  That torch of yours is rather a stinker!' said Hoole, springing\r\nlightly down the ladder.  'My!  This is interesting, Trentham.  I\r\nwondered where the path led.'\r\n\r\n'You 've found a path?'\r\n\r\n'Sure!  Didn't you see it?'\r\n\r\n'No.  The fact is, Meek and I were so much taken up with the wreck that\r\nwe forgot everything else.  But we didn't see any footprints in the\r\nsand.'\r\n\r\n'There are none about here, except yours. The path is way back a few\r\nyards.  I caught sight of a narrow fissure in the cliff, what we call a\r\nchimney in the Rockies.  I pushed through the undergrowth to take a keek\r\nat it, and came upon distinct signs of a beaten track, leading straight\r\nto the chimney. That's barely wide enough to admit a man; Grinson would\r\nstick, I guess; but 'tis surely used as a passage.  There are notches\r\ncut in the cliff at regular intervals.'\r\n\r\n'Then we can get away?'\r\n\r\n'Sure!  All but Grinson, that is.  We 'd have to leave him behind.'\r\n\r\n'Don't say so, sir,' said Meek.  'Mr. Grinson 's not so fat as he\r\nwas--not by a long way.  I 'm afeard if he stays, I must stay too.'\r\n\r\n'Thank 'ee, Ephraim, me lad,' said Grinson warmly.  'But Mr. Hoole is\r\npulling my leg.  You take him too serious; he 's a gentleman as will\r\nhave his joke.  He wouldn' go for to desert two poor seamen.'\r\n\r\n'I never could understand a joke--never!' said Meek.  ''Tis a\r\nmisfortune, but so I was born.'\r\n\r\nHoole and Trentham, meanwhile, had been examining the relics and\r\ndiscussing the bearing of their discoveries on the situation.\r\n\r\n'It's quite clear that the wreck is visited,' said Trentham.\r\n\r\n'By natives, of course.  Why?  How often?  It doesn't matter much,\r\nexcept that if we saw them, we might get a notion as to whether we could\r\nsafely go among them and get their help.  You are sure the chimney is\r\nclimbable?'\r\n\r\n'Certain.  The notches are deep, and you could set your back against the\r\nopposite wall and climb without using your hands.'\r\n\r\n'I 'll have a look at it.  Then we had better go back to our boat, get\r\nsome grub, and talk things over.  It's too late to go in for further\r\nadventures to-day.'\r\n\r\n'That's so.  Say, I 'd leave the hatch off for a while.  The place\r\nreeks--it would give us away.'\r\n\r\n'Right!  We 'll clear out.  The men can keep guard above while we 're\r\nexamining that chimney.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                               THE DRUMS\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hour later they were seated in the boat, nibbling biscuits and taking\r\nturns to sip at the water in their keg.\r\n\r\n'Now that we 've proved that Grinson can just squeeze into the chimney,'\r\nsaid Hoole, 'I guess we had better climb to-morrow and take a look\r\nround.  But what then?  What do you know about this blamed island,\r\nGrinson?'\r\n\r\n'Not as much as you could stuff into a pipe, in a manner of speaking,'\r\nsaid Grinson. 'A few years ago I spent a couple of weeks in Moresby and\r\nround about--you can bear me out, Ephraim, me lad--and I know no more\r\nthan what I picked up there.  That's on the south-east: we 're on the\r\nnorth, on what's German ground, or was; and by all that's said, the\r\nGermans never took much trouble to do more than hoist their flag. They\r\n've got a port somewhere, but whether we 're east of it or west of it, I\r\ndon't know no more than the dead.'\r\n\r\n'So when we climb, we shan't know which way to go,' said Trentham.  'Yet\r\nour only chance is to make along the coast till we reach some white\r\nsettlement, unless we could manage to attract attention on some passing\r\nship.  You don't know what the natives are like hereabout?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir.  They do say there 's little chaps about two feet high in the\r\nforests, but I never seed 'em.  The folks on the coast ain't so little,\r\nand down Moresby way they 've learnt to behave decent; but I reckon they\r\n're pretty wild in other parts, and I know some of 'em are 'orrid\r\ncannibals, 'cos I was nearly eat myself once.  We was lying becalmed off\r\nthe Dutch coast, away in the west of this 'ere island, and some of us\r\nhad gone ashore for water, and----'\r\n\r\n'What's that noise?' exclaimed Hoole, springing up.\r\n\r\nA faint purring sound came to their ears.\r\n\r\n'It's uncommonly like an aeroplane engine,' said Trentham.  'It would be\r\nrather fun to be taken off in an aeroplane.'\r\n\r\n'Never in life!' said Meek mournfully. 'It 'ud turn my weak head.'\r\n\r\n'Your head will be quite safe, Meek,' said Trentham.  'The only\r\naeroplane that's likely to be in these latitudes is the one that scouted\r\nfor the German raider.  Our poor captain guessed what was coming when he\r\nsaw the thing, and three hours afterwards they got us, and he was dead.'\r\n\r\n'There it is!' cried Hoole, pointing sea-ward.\r\n\r\nThey were just able to discern the machine, little more than a speck,\r\nflying along from west to east.  In a few minutes it had disappeared.\r\n\r\n'Flying after other game,' said Trentham. 'You were saying, Grinson?'\r\n\r\n'And I got parted from the rest, through chasing a butterfly, which I\r\nwas always a stoodent of nature.  I had just nabbed a lovely pink 'un\r\nwith gold spots, when a crowd of naked savages surrounded me, their\r\nfaces hidjous with paint, and their spears pointing at me like the\r\nspokes of a wheel.  Not having my pistol with me, I couldn't shoot 'em\r\nall down one after another, so I offered 'em the butterfly, then a brass\r\nbutton, and one or two other little things I had about me, which any\r\ndecent nigger would 'a been thankful for. But no!  Nothing but my gore\r\nwould satisfy 'em, or rather my fat, for I was in them days twice the\r\nsize I am now.  You can bear me out, Ephraim, me lad?'\r\n\r\n'I wouldn't be sure 'twas exactly twice, Mr. Grinson, but not far\r\nshort--a pound or so under, p'r'aps.'\r\n\r\n'I thought my last hour was come, and it came on me sudden that I hadn't\r\nmade my will----'\r\n\r\n'There 's a smudge of smoke far out,' cried Hoole.  'If we get on a rock\r\nand wave our shirts, somebody 'll see us.'\r\n\r\nThey looked eagerly out to sea.  A steamer, just distinguishable on the\r\nhorizon, was proceeding in the same direction as the aeroplane they had\r\nnoticed a few minutes before. Grinson put up his hands to shade his eyes\r\nas he gazed.\r\n\r\n'If I had a pair of glasses, or that there telescope in the wreck!  Ah!\r\nI may be wrong, but I believe 'tis that ruffian of a pirate as sunk our\r\ncraft yesterday.  Seems to me we 'd better keep our shirts on our backs,\r\nsir.'\r\n\r\n'I dare say you 're right,' said Hoole. 'For my part I 'd rather try my\r\nluck with cannibals than with those Germans again.'\r\n\r\n'Which I agree with you, sir,' said Grinson.  'With luck, or I may say\r\ngumption, you can escape from cannibals, like I did.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, yes.  How did you get out of that ring of spears?'\r\n\r\nThe boatswain took such pleasure in retailing his yarns that the two\r\nyoung men gave him plenty of rope.\r\n\r\n'I was fair upset at not having made my will, thinking of how the\r\nlawyers would fight over my remains, in a manner of speaking. So I takes\r\nout my pocket-book and my fountain pen, and with a steady hand I begins\r\nto write.  It shows what comes of a man doing his dooty.  Them cannibals\r\nwas struck all of a heap when they seed black water oozing out of a\r\nstick.  They lowered the points of their spears, and, instead of being a\r\ncircle, they formed up three deep behind me, looking over my shoulder.\r\nIt come into my head they took me for a medicine-man, and the dawn of a\r\ngreat hope lit up my pearly eyes.'\r\n\r\n'Where did you get that, Grinson?' asked Hoole.\r\n\r\n'What, sir?'\r\n\r\n'That about \"pearly eyes\" and the rest.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, that!  It took my fancy in a nice little story called _Lord Lyle's\r\nRevenge_ as a kind lady once give me, and I 've never forgot it.  Well,\r\nas I was saying, I set to droring a portrait of the ugliest mug among\r\n'em--fuzzy hair, nose bones and all--they a-watching me all the time\r\nwith bated breath; and when I 'd put in the finishing stroke, blest if\r\nevery man Jack of 'em didn't begin to quarrel about whose photo it was.\r\nNever did you hear such a hullabaloo. Fixing of 'em with my eagle eye, I\r\nwaved 'em back like as if I was shooing geese, took a pin from my weskit\r\nand stuck the portrait on a tree, and told 'em to fight it out who was\r\nthe ugliest of 'em, 'cos he was the owner. The cannibals made a rush for\r\nthe tree, every one of 'em trying to prevent the rest from getting the\r\npicture, and I lit my pipe and walked away as steady as a bobby on\r\ndooty. You can bear me out, Ephraim, me lad?'\r\n\r\n'Wonderful steady you was, Mr. Grinson, and the bottle of rum empty too.\r\nI couldn't have walked so steady.  The other chaps said as how you 'd\r\nbeen taking a nap, but I never believed 'em.'\r\n\r\n'Never go napping on dooty, Ephraim; which I mean to say we 'll have to\r\ntake watch and watch to-night, gentlemen.  What with cannibals and them\r\nbig hermit crabs and other vermin, 'twouldn't be safe for us all to have\r\nour peepers shut.'\r\n\r\n'Very true, Grinson,' said Trentham. 'The boat's rather exposed: you had\r\nbetter choose a spot on the beach where we can shelter for the night.\r\nThere are some rocks yonder that look promising.  Then we 'll arrange\r\nabout watching.'\r\n\r\nGrinson and Meek went off together; the others meanwhile strolled up and\r\ndown, discussing plans for the morrow.\r\n\r\n'We 're so badly off,' said Trentham. 'You 've luckily got your\r\nrevolver; any spare cartridges?'\r\n\r\n'A score or so.'\r\n\r\n'I 've only a penknife, worse luck.  Grinson has a long knife, and Meek,\r\nno doubt, has a knife of some sort; but three knives and a revolver\r\nwon't enable us to put up much of a fight if we really do come across\r\nany cannibals.'\r\n\r\n'And I guess that fountain pens and pocket books won't be much good.  We\r\ncouldn't patch up the boat?'\r\n\r\n'Without tools?  Besides, I shouldn't care to risk a voyage.  We may\r\nhave a chance of reaching some settlement overland, and I dare say could\r\npick up some food; but on the sea we might drift for weeks, even if we\r\ncould exist on our few biscuits and little water.'\r\n\r\n'Well, old man, we 'll get what sleep we can and try the chimney in the\r\nmorning. The sky promises fair weather, anyway; did you ever see such a\r\nsplendid sunset?'\r\n\r\nThey were facing west, and beyond the headland the sun, a gorgeous ball\r\nof fire, was casting a blood-red glow on the scarcely rippling sea.  On\r\nthe cliffs the leaves of the palms were edged with crimson, and\r\nflickered like flames as they were gently stirred by the breeze.  The\r\ntwo friends stood side by side, silently watching the magnificent\r\npanorama. Suddenly Hoole caught Trentham by the arm, and pulled him down\r\nbehind a rock.\r\n\r\n'My sakes!' he exclaimed under his breath.  'D' you see people moving\r\nbetween the wreck and the cliff?'\r\n\r\nTrentham took off his hat and peered cautiously over the rocks.\r\n\r\n'You 're right,' he said.  'It's not easy to make 'em out; they 're in\r\nthe shadow of the headland; we 're a good mile away, I fancy. They can't\r\nsee us at present, but we had better warn the others; the sun as it\r\nmoves round will strike us presently.'\r\n\r\nThey returned to the spot which Grinson had selected for their camping\r\nplace--a space of clear sand protected on one side by a group of rocks\r\nand on the other by a clump of bushes spreading from the base of the\r\ncliffs. Meek had already brought up their scanty stores from the boat;\r\nGrinson had stripped off his jersey and shirt.\r\n\r\n'If you 'll take my advice, gentlemen,' he said, 'you 'll swill the\r\nsticky off--you 'll sleep all the better for it.  Bathing all in I\r\nwouldn't advise, in case of sharks.'\r\n\r\n'Shall we get any sleep, I wonder?' said Trentham.  'There are men on\r\nthe beach, Grinson.'\r\n\r\n'Men, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Cannibals!' murmured Meek.\r\n\r\n'We saw figures moving between the wreck and the cliff.'\r\n\r\n'Holy poker!' exclaimed the boatswain, rapidly drawing on his shirt.\r\nTrentham noticed momentarily the figure of a bird tattooed on his upper\r\nleft arm.  'Hope they don't come this way.'\r\n\r\n'Why shouldn't we take the bull by the horns and go _their_ way?' said\r\nHoole.  'I 'll tackle 'em, if you like.  You don't know but we 'd make\r\nfriends of them.'\r\n\r\n'Not by no manner of means, sir, I beg you,' said Grinson.  'The New\r\nGuinea savages are the fiercest in creation; Ephraim can bear me out;\r\ncunning as the devil, and that treacherous.  The tales I could tell! But\r\nI wouldn't freeze your blood, not for the world; all I say is, keep out\r\nof their clutches.'\r\n\r\n'Where can we hide, if so be they come this way?' faltered Meek.\r\n\r\n'There 's nothing to bring them along this bare beach,' said Trentham.\r\n'They won't see us if we remain here; I doubt whether they 'll even see\r\nthe boat.  No doubt they 'll be gone by the morning.'\r\n\r\n'Just so,' said Hoole.  'Still, we 've got to meet them some time,\r\nprobably----'\r\n\r\n'Better by daylight, sir,' said Grinson. 'Wild beasts and savages are\r\nalways most fearsome at night.  I say, lay low.'\r\n\r\n'As low as you can,' Meek added.\r\n\r\nThe glow of sunset faded, and in the deepening shade the figures were no\r\nlonger visible.  The four men sat in their shelter, talking in\r\nundertones, none of them disposed to sleep.  For a while only the slow\r\ntumbling surf bore a murmurous counterpoint to their voices.  All at\r\nonce a dull boom struck upon their ears.  It was not the explosive boom\r\nof a gun, but a deep prolonged note. Soon it was followed by a similar\r\nsound, at a slightly higher pitch, and the two notes alternated at\r\nregular intervals.\r\n\r\n'Drums, by the powers!' ejaculated Grinson.  ''Tis a dance, or a feast,\r\nor both.'\r\n\r\n'A mighty slow dance,' said Hoole.  'I 'd fall asleep between the\r\nsteps.'\r\n\r\nBut even as he spoke the sounds became louder and more rapid, and\r\npresently in the midst of the now continuous booming a voice was heard,\r\nchanting in monotone.  Into this broke a deeper growling note as from\r\nmany voices in unison, and after the song and accompaniment had\r\ncontinued for some time with ever-increasing vigour and volume, they\r\ncame to a sudden end in a short series of strident barks, half smothered\r\nby the clamour of the drums.\r\n\r\nThe four men had risen, and leaning on the rocks, with their faces\r\ntowards the sounds, had listened to the strange chorus.\r\n\r\n'It's extraordinarily thrilling,' said Trentham.  'I 'd never have\r\nbelieved that drums could make such music.'\r\n\r\n'It trickles down my spine,' Hoole confessed.  'And they 're pretty\r\nnearly a mile away.  What must it be on the spot?  Say, if they start\r\nagain, shall we creep along and see?'\r\n\r\n'I 'm game.  Look!  They 've lit a fire. There's some ceremony on\r\nhand--not a thing to be missed.'\r\n\r\n'Which means a feast, sir,' said Grinson. 'If you ask me, I say don't\r\ngo.  It 'll turn your blood.'\r\n\r\n'Special if 'tis a man they eat,' said Meek.\r\n\r\n'You two stay home; Mr. Trentham and I will go,' said Hoole.  'The rocks\r\nand scrub will give plenty of cover; besides, the feasters will be busy.\r\nWe 'll be unseen spectators in the gallery.'\r\n\r\nHeedless of the further expostulations of the seamen, Trentham and Hoole\r\nset off, and keeping well under the shadow of the cliffs, tramped\r\nrapidly towards the growing blaze. As they drew nearer to it, they moved\r\nwith greater caution, careful not to come directly within the glow.  The\r\ndrums recommenced their slow tapping, and when the white men arrived at\r\na spot where, screened by the bushes, they could see unseen, the dance\r\nhad just begun.\r\n\r\nThe fire was kindled on a clear space between the wreck and the\r\nvegetation that clothed the foot of the cliffs.  Beyond it, nearer the\r\nvessel, about twenty natives were stamping in time with the two drums,\r\nplaced at one end of the line.  They were men of average height, well\r\nbuilt, but rather thin in the legs, wearing fantastic head-dresses, bone\r\nor coral necklaces and armlets, and scanty loin-cloths.  The watchers\r\nwere at once struck by certain differences in the types of feature. All\r\nthe savages were a dull black in colour, except where they had painted\r\ntheir skins white or red, but while the majority had wide bridgeless\r\nnoses and frizzy hair, there were some whose noses were arched, and\r\nwhose hair, though curled, was neither stiff nor bushy.  Every face was\r\ndisfigured by a long skewer of bone passed through the nose.\r\n\r\nThe dance was disappointing.  The men did little more than stamp up and\r\ndown, swaying a little now and then, stepping a pace or two forward or\r\nbackward, shaking their spears, and emitting a grunt.  There was no\r\nexcitement, no crescendo of martial fury.\r\n\r\n'A very tame performance!' whispered Hoole.\r\n\r\nBut Trentham was no longer watching the dance.  Beyond the dancers, only\r\noccasionally visible as they moved, there was something that had fixed\r\nhis attention.  He could not quite determine what it was, but a\r\nsuspicion was troubling him.  Between the swaying figures there\r\nappeared, now and again, a whitish object partially obscured by bush,\r\nand barely within the circle of light from the fire.  It was motionless,\r\nbut the fugitive glimpses that Trentham caught of it made him more and\r\nmore uneasy.\r\n\r\n'You see that white thing?' he whispered, taking Hoole by the arm.\r\n\r\n'Yep!  What of it?'\r\n\r\nTrentham pressed his arm more closely. The dancers had moved a little\r\nfarther apart, and for the first time the object behind them was\r\ncompletely outlined.\r\n\r\n'By gum, it's a man!' murmured Hoole.\r\n\r\n'And a white man!' added Trentham. 'I was afraid so.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                              THE CHIMNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nNoiselessly the two spectators slipped away through the bushes.\r\nStartled by the discovery of a white man, whose very stillness declared\r\nhim a prisoner in bonds among these dancing savages, they felt the need\r\nof talking freely, unrestrained by precautions against being overheard.\r\nThey hurried along at the base of the cliffs until they were out of\r\nearshot, then sat on a low rock where they could still see all that went\r\non around the fire.\r\n\r\n'Can it be that planter fellow on the _Berenisa_?  What was his name?'\r\nsaid Trentham.\r\n\r\n'You mean Grimshaw; he was the only man besides ourselves who wore\r\nducks.  I don't know.  Grimshaw was a small man; the prisoner seemed a\r\nbig fellow.  I couldn't see his face.'\r\n\r\n'Nor I.  Whoever it is, I 'm afraid his number 's up.'\r\n\r\n'I didn't take much stock of Grinson's yarns about cannibals, but it\r\nappears he 's right.  The niggers would hardly bring their prisoner down\r\nthe chimney for the fun of it, or the trouble of taking him up again.'\r\n\r\n'Did you see a cooking-pot?'\r\n\r\n'No, I was too busy watching the dancers to look around.'\r\n\r\n'We 'll have to get him away.'\r\n\r\n'Whew!  That's a tall proposition, Trentham.'\r\n\r\n'Confoundedly; but we can't stand off and see a white man cut up!  Hang\r\nit all, Hoole, it's too horrible to think about!'\r\n\r\n'Ghastly.  Yet remember where we are. We might get him loose, but what\r\nthen? They 'd hunt us over this strip of beach, and we 've proved pretty\r\nwell there 's nowhere to hide.'\r\n\r\n'Our only chance is to get him up the chimney.'\r\n\r\n'My dear man!'\r\n\r\n'It may be out of the frying-pan into the fire, if there are more of the\r\nsavages on top, but down below his fate is certain, whereas----'\r\n\r\n'But there 's the climbing.  I 've done some in the Rockies, but I guess\r\nyou 're a tenderfoot at mountaineering, and as for the seamen----'\r\n\r\n'If they can scramble up rigging, they ought to be able to manage that\r\nchimney. I 'm sure I could.  And really, there 's no time to lose.  They\r\n're still drumming and dancing, but who knows when they 'll feel hungry?\r\nWe had better bring up the others at once.'\r\n\r\nThey got up, and hastened towards their camping-place.\r\n\r\n'It's the first step that costs,' remarked Hoole.  'How to get him away\r\nwith the firelight full on him.  It's a ticklish stunt.'\r\n\r\n'We can but try--we must try!  Hullo! Here 's Grinson.'\r\n\r\nThe two seamen stepped towards them from the shelter of a bush.\r\n\r\n'We came to meet you, sir,' Grinson began.\r\n\r\n'Hush, Grinson!' said Trentham.  'Muffle that organ-pipe of yours.  The\r\nsavages have got a white man.'\r\n\r\n'Never!' exclaimed Meek, in husky astonishment.\r\n\r\n'He 's lying tied to a bush there, apparently,' Trentham went on.  'A\r\nman dressed in white.'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Grimshaw!  How did they get him?' said Grinson.  'He must have been\r\ncast ashore.'\r\n\r\n'We don't think it's he, but it may be. Anyhow, we must try to rescue\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\n'Save us, sir!  We 'll only go into the pot too.  It will be like taking\r\na bone from a dog, only worse.'\r\n\r\n'Worse ain't the word for it,' said Meek. 'And you 'd go first, Mr.\r\nGrinson, being a man of flesh.'\r\n\r\n'Tough, Ephraim--uncommon tough, me lad.  Any nigger of sense would\r\nrather have something young and juicy, like Mr. Trentham. I remember\r\nonce----'\r\n\r\n'Not now, Grinson,' Trentham interposed. 'We must make up our minds;\r\nthere 's no time for recollections.'\r\n\r\n'Plenty of time, sir.  These 'ere cannibals never start cooking till the\r\nmoon 's high aloft, and she 's only just peeping above the skyline.'\r\n\r\n'That's a relief, if you 're right----'\r\n\r\n'I can bear him out, sir,' said Meek.\r\n\r\n'It gives us more time to make our plans. Our idea is, Grinson, if we\r\nget the prisoner away, to climb up that crack in the cliff; there's no\r\nsafety below.  There may be danger above, of course; it's a choice\r\nbetween two evils.  We meant to try our luck to-morrow, you know; we\r\nonly anticipate by a few hours, and though climbing will be more\r\ndifficult in the darkness than it would be in the light, you and Meek\r\nare used to clambering up the rigging at all hours and in all\r\nweathers----'\r\n\r\n'Say no more about that, sir.  We 'd back ourselves against cats.'\r\n\r\n'Or monkeys,' suggested Meek.\r\n\r\n'You 've got no tail, Ephraim.  'Tis not the climbing as I 've any fear\r\nabout, sir; 'tis first the bonfire, second what's up top, third and\r\nlast--there ain't no third, now I come to think of it.'\r\n\r\n'The second we 've agreed to chance.  The first--well, the only thing is\r\nto work round the savages and get between them and the chimney; then one\r\nof us must creep or crawl as close to them as he can, and watch his\r\nopportunity.  There's no need for more than one.'\r\n\r\n'That's my stunt,' said Hoole.\r\n\r\n'Not at all.  It's between you and me; we 're younger and quicker on our\r\npins than the others; but why you should have the most risky part of the\r\njob----'\r\n\r\n'The reason 's as clear as daylight.  The quickest climber ought to go\r\nlast.  I allow that Grinson and Meek are probably more spry than I am in\r\nclimbing; but in any case they 're ruled out.  You 've never climbed a\r\nchimney--I have.  I think that fixes it.'\r\n\r\n'But the prisoner.  It's unlikely he can climb quickly, and the last man\r\ncouldn't go faster than he.'\r\n\r\n'You ought to have been a lawyer, Trentham. But I have you yet.  The\r\nlast man may have to hold the savages off while the prisoner, slow by\r\nhypothesis, does his climb. Then speed will be vital when he climbs\r\nhimself--see?'\r\n\r\n'Axing your pardon, sir, and speaking like a father, as you may say,'\r\nsaid Grinson, 'there 's only one way of settling a little difference so\r\n's to satisfy both parties.  I 've seed many a quarrel nipped in the\r\nbud----'\r\n\r\n'A quarrel, you juggins!' cried Trentham. 'There 's no quarrel!'\r\n\r\n'Just so, sir--that's what I said.  It's a difference, and a difference\r\ncan't never grow to be a quarrel if you just toss for it.'\r\n\r\n'There 's our Solomon!' said Hoole. 'Spin up, Trentham!'\r\n\r\nThe rising moon gave light enough.  Trentham spun a shilling.\r\n\r\n'Heads!' Hoole called.\r\n\r\n'Tails it is!  That's settled!'\r\n\r\n''Tis fate: you can't go agen it,' murmured Meek.\r\n\r\n'Those fellows must be pretty tired, drumming away like that,' said\r\nTrentham.  'But we had better make a start, Grinson.  I think we ought\r\nto take our biscuits and water: they 'll last us a day or two, and we\r\ndon't know what chances of getting food there 'll be on the cliff.  You\r\nand Meek fetch them along.  We 'll wait for you here.'\r\n\r\n'They took it well,' said Hoole, when the men had gone.  'I was afraid\r\nMeek would jib.'\r\n\r\n'Meek 's all right,' responded Trentham. 'The British sailor-man has his\r\nweak points, but he 's not a funk.'\r\n\r\nHe began to stride up and down with his hands in his pockets.  Hoole\r\nwatched him for half a minute or so, then said:\r\n\r\n'You 'd better take my revolver.'\r\n\r\n'Why in the world?' said Trentham, swinging round on him.\r\n\r\n'It may be useful--last resource, you know.'\r\n\r\n'If we can't do without that----  Why, man, a shot would absolutely dish\r\nus, would be heard for miles, and bring up every cannibal there is.\r\nThis job has got to be done quietly.'\r\n\r\n'I reckon there 'll be a pretty big row when they miss their supper.\r\nWell, if you won't take it, remember I 've got it, anyway.'\r\n\r\nSome fifteen minutes later the four men, in single file, were stealing\r\nalong the inner edge of the beach, close against the cliffs. Trentham,\r\nwho was leading, took a zigzag course for the sake of cover from the\r\nscattered rocks and patches of vegetation.  The seamen in the rear had\r\nslung the provisions about their shoulders with lashings from the boat,\r\nand on their account Trentham set a slower pace than his anxiety to be\r\nin time would otherwise have commended.  The fire was burning more\r\nbrightly, whiffs of acrid smoke were borne on the breeze, and the moon,\r\nabout ten days old, appeared to have reached its greatest altitude, and\r\nwas accentuating every irregularity on the face of the cliffs.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer to the fire, Trentham moved still more slowly,\r\npicking his way with care.  Now and then some small animal, with a whisk\r\nand a rustle, scurried away in the undergrowth.  Once Meek, who bore the\r\nkeg, tripped over what he declared was a monster crab, and fell forward,\r\nthe keg hitting a rock with a sharp crack.  The rest halted and held\r\ntheir breath; had the sound been heard by the savages?  The monotonous\r\ndrumming continued unbroken, and they went on.\r\n\r\nBetween the fire and the cleft that was their destination, grew the\r\ntangled vegetation in which Hoole had discovered the track of footsteps.\r\nIt grew higher than their heads, and they were able to enter it without\r\nmuch risk of being observed.  A few whispered words were exchanged\r\nbetween Trentham and Hoole, then the latter led the seamen towards the\r\nchimney, which stretched upwards like a black streak in the moonlit\r\nprecipice, while Trentham struck to the left, and crept cautiously\r\ntowards the outer edge of the bushes, where he could look out upon the\r\nfestive scene.\r\n\r\nHis heart seemed to be making more noise than the drums.  His lips were\r\ndry.  The skin of his face felt tight.  'Nerves!' he thought, with angry\r\nimpatience.  It was strange how, without the slightest consciousness of\r\nfear, his mental realisation of all that was at stake thus affected his\r\nbody.  Taking a grip of himself, he went forward and peered through the\r\nstiff crinkled foliage.  For a few moments he saw nothing but the glare\r\nof the fire; then, as he gathered self-command, he was able to take in\r\ndetails which he had missed at his view a short while before.\r\n\r\nThe dancers were still swaying to and fro. At one side, crouched on the\r\nsand, were two men holding in one hand an object like a huge dice-box,\r\nand with the other beating a skin, as he supposed, stretched across the\r\ncircular end.  At the other side, near the fire, stood two iron\r\ncooking-pots.  Beyond, in the same place, lay the motionless white\r\nfigure. Everything was clearly illuminated by the flames, and Trentham\r\nwondered, with a feeling of despair, how it would be possible to\r\napproach the prisoner unseen.\r\n\r\nA few minutes after his arrival, the dance and the drumming came to an\r\nabrupt end. In the ensuing silence he heard the wash of the waves beyond\r\nthe wreck, and a strange squealing grunt which, until then, had been\r\ndrowned by the deep tones of the drums and the barking cries of the men.\r\nOne of the savages, who wore a tall feathered headdress, glanced up at\r\nthe moon, and said a few words to the others.  All of them squatted on\r\nthe sand except two, who went to the bush, some twenty yards away, to\r\nwhich the prisoner was bound.  Trentham's blood ran cold.  He wished he\r\nhad brought Hoole's revolver, for it seemed that nothing else could save\r\nthe helpless man, and he was on the point of shouting for Hoole, when a\r\npiercing squeal, such as no human being ever uttered, gave him at once a\r\nshock and a sense of relief.  Next moment the savages returned towards\r\nthe fire, one of them carrying the body of a small pig.\r\n\r\nTrentham almost laughed as the tension of the last few moments was\r\nrelaxed.  The men were not cannibals after all!  He looked on as in a\r\ndream while one of the men cut up the animal, and the other raked over\r\nthe fire with a spear.  But with reflection his former anxiety came\r\nback.  Why had the savages brought their prisoner here?  To leave him to\r\nbe drowned?  But he was far above high-water mark.  Were they reserving\r\nhim as the _bonne bouche_ of their feast?\r\n\r\nOne of the cooking-pots was placed over the fire, and the dismembered\r\npig was thrown into it.  Beyond, the savages squatted in a half-circle,\r\ntalking.  Their leader raised an arm towards the moon, and then jerked\r\nit in the direction of the prisoner.  The gestures made things clear to\r\nTrentham.  The moon had not gained an altitude which cannibal\r\nsuperstition required for the slaying of a man.\r\n\r\nTrentham felt himself flush with hope. The savages had their faces\r\ntowards him, their backs towards the prisoner.  The raking of the fire\r\nhad dulled the flames, and the cooking-pot partly obscured the glowing\r\nembers.  There was still time.\r\n\r\nHe crept through the bushes until he had almost encircled the space upon\r\nwhich the savages had built their fire.  Then, however, a gap of clear\r\nsand, twenty or thirty yards wide, separated him from the bush where the\r\nprisoner lay.  Was it possible to cross that gap undiscovered?  No\r\nfriendly cloud obscured the moon; if one of the savages chanced to turn,\r\nhe could not fail to see the moving figure.\r\n\r\nTrentham looked around him.  There was no cover on that stretch of\r\nsand--no bush, no bank of seaweed, no wave-cast log.  But the surface\r\nwas a little uneven; the winds had blown up slight mounds and hollowed\r\nshallow troughs.  White-clad as he was, the white was stained and toned\r\nby water and exposure, he might perhaps crawl through the depressions\r\nwithout attracting attention.  But it must be at a snail's pace, inch by\r\ninch, flat as a worm.\r\n\r\nHe lay on all-fours, waited a moment or two, then started on his\r\nlaborious progress. The mounds seemed higher, the troughs deeper, now\r\nthat he was on their level, and the yielding sand helped to cover him,\r\nthough at the same time it made movement difficult.  Inch by inch he\r\ncrawled on, stopping at every yard to listen; he dared not raise his\r\nhead to look.  The savages were still jabbering.  Every now and then the\r\ndull glow of the fire was brightened by a flicker, at which he lay still\r\nas a log, moving on again when the transient flame had died down.\r\n\r\nThus, after exertion more exhausting than if he had run a mile, he came\r\nround to the rear of the bush to which the prisoner was bound.  The\r\nfoliage was thin and withered. Raising himself on his knees, he saw that\r\nhe could easily reach through the branches and cut the man's bonds.\r\nWould his sudden action alarm the prisoner--perhaps cause him to cry\r\nout?  The man, as he could see now, had been placed face downwards, and\r\nwas tied to the central stem.  He was very still. Perhaps rescue was\r\nalready too late.  But no! As Trentham gazed, he discerned a slight\r\nmovement of the head; it was as though the prisoner sought easier\r\nbreathing.  The moonlight revealed a bald crown and heavily bearded\r\ncheeks; it was certainly not Grimshaw, the planter who had been\r\nTrentham's fellow-passenger on the _Berenisa_.\r\n\r\nTrentham was still undecided whether to risk a preliminary warning, when\r\nthe movements of the savages showed that the critical moment had come.\r\nThe cooking-pot had been removed from the embers and set before the\r\nleader, who plunged his hand into it, took out a small joint, and with a\r\nhollow, wailing cry flung it into the air in the direction of the moon,\r\nthe other men chanting a weird chorus.  Then they sprang up, gathered\r\nabout the pot, and began to eat, with horrid sounds of gobbling.\r\n\r\n'Now 's the time!' thought Trentham. Stretching forward the hand in\r\nwhich he held his open knife, he cut through the tendrils about the\r\nprisoner's arms and feet, and the longer strands which attached him to\r\nthe bush, whispering a single word of caution. For a few moments the man\r\nlay almost as still as before, but Trentham saw that he was stretching\r\nhis limbs and raising his head to look towards the fire, from which\r\nthere came now only the faintest gleam.  Then slowly, almost\r\nimperceptibly, he crawled backward through the bush.  Trentham rose to\r\nhis feet. When the man reached him, he took him by the hand and helped\r\nhim to rise, then led him with cautious steps, under cover of the bush,\r\ndown the beach towards the spot where the wreck in its sandy bed stood\r\nup slightly from its surroundings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'NOW 'S THE TIME!']\r\n\r\nEdging round this, the two men crouched below the level of the savages'\r\nheads, and in silence, one step at a time, moved along parallel with the\r\nsea-line, until they arrived at the outlying edge of the bushes which\r\nstretched up towards the foot of the chimney. Here they rose erect and\r\nquickened their pace. They were half-way to the cliffs when there was a\r\nsound of crackling.  Looking over his shoulder, Trentham saw one of the\r\nsavages in the act of throwing more fuel upon the fire, which suddenly\r\nbroke into a bright flame. Immediately afterwards the air rang with a\r\nblood-curdling yell, and the whole troop of savages rushed towards the\r\nbush where they had left their prisoner, and swept round it in the\r\ndirection of the sea.\r\n\r\nTrentham hurried on.  Panting heavily, the prisoner followed on his\r\nheels.  At the foot of the chimney Hoole was waiting.\r\n\r\n'The men are up--all's clear,' he said, flashing a look at the stranger,\r\nwhose face was pallid and ghastly in the moonlight. 'Guess he 's about\r\ndone,' he thought, and wondered whether his strength would hold out.\r\n'You go first, Trentham; I 'll cover the rear.'\r\n\r\nTrentham entered the narrow fissure, set a foot in the lowest notch,\r\nand, levering his back against the opposite wall, began to climb.  The\r\nstranger, who had spoken no word, followed with nervous haste, so\r\nquickly that at the second step his head touched Trentham's boot.\r\n\r\n'Steady!  Steady!' Hoole called up in a loud whisper.  'One slip, and\r\nyou 're done!'\r\n\r\nThe man paid no heed.  He seemed to feel that he was on the verge of\r\nexhaustion, and must attain that giddy height while there was yet time.\r\nHoole watched him anxiously; it would hardly be safe to follow until the\r\nman had reached the top, yet the savages were returning.  He heard their\r\nyells of rage, and presently caught sight of them running up the beach\r\nin a scattered line.  A few moments later a ferocious shriek proclaimed\r\nthat one of them at least had espied the men climbing.\r\n\r\n'I must chance it,' thought Hoole.  'He 's a heavy chap--if he falls.'\r\n\r\nWith the speed acquired in mountaineering, he was soon on the heels of\r\nthe rescued prisoner, whose quick pants alarmed him. About sixty feet\r\nfrom the base the man gave a long gasp and stopped.  Hoole stuck his\r\nfeet firmly, bent his head, and presented an arched back.  At that\r\nmoment he heard a sharp whizzing sound.  The man grunted, and began to\r\nclimb again.  Hoole followed. Something flew with a hiss past his ear,\r\nand clicked against the wall.\r\n\r\n'Arrows!' he thought.  'I wonder what their range is.'\r\n\r\nUp and up, foot by foot, arrows whizzing and clicking, the savages\r\nyelling with ever-increasing fury, and audible through it all the\r\nlaboured breathing of the man above. Then the shooting suddenly ceased;\r\none tremendous yell, then silence.  Hoole guessed that the savages had\r\nbegun to climb.  But he was now a hundred feet above them; if the\r\nstranger's strength held out, they would never recover the start.  Their\r\nbare feet made no sound as they clambered up; the fissure was too narrow\r\nfor him to see them. Once more the stranger stopped for breath, and when\r\nHoole stopped also, a shout of triumph, immensely loud in the narrow\r\npassage, announced that the savages were gaining.  The sound seemed to\r\ngive their victim new strength; he clambered more quickly than before.\r\nPresently Hoole heard Trentham's voice quietly giving encouragement.\r\nThen, looking up, he saw the man hauled over the edge, and five seconds\r\nlater his shoulders were grasped by Grinson's brawny hands, and he lay\r\namong thick grass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UP AND UP, FOOT BY FOOT, ARROWS WHIZZING AND CLICKING.]\r\n\r\n'Just saved your bacon, mister,' he said to the man beside him.\r\n\r\nThe stranger brushed the sweat from his pallid brow with his sleeve,\r\nuttered an inarticulate grunt, then fell backwards fainting.\r\n\r\n'Batten down, Ephraim, me lad!' cried Grinson.\r\n\r\nThe seamen had turned to good account the hour they had spent alone on\r\nthe cliff top. With ready resource they had cut down pliant branches\r\nfrom the surrounding trees, torn up saplings by the roots, and begun to\r\nconstruct a hurdle large enough to cover the opening.  It was\r\nunfinished, but as soon as Hoole had reached the top they threw it\r\nacross the gap, and hastily piled upon it the material still unused.\r\nThe leading native, arriving half a minute later, found his egress\r\nblocked by this criss-cross of trunks and branches, which yielded only\r\nslightly to the butting of his head.  Meanwhile, Hoole and Trentham were\r\ntearing down more branches, and casting them upon the heap, which\r\nquickly grew to such a size that Goliath himself could not have raised\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFrom beneath it rose the muffled cries of the savages.  Then all was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                                MR. HAAN\r\n\r\n\r\n'Sprinkle a little water on his face, Meek,' said Trentham, indicating\r\nthe rescued prisoner, who lay unconscious where he had fallen.  'Only a\r\nlittle--we have none to spare.'\r\n\r\n'Tickle his nose,' suggested Hoole. 'Trentham, I 'll take a look round;\r\nwe may be on the edge of a hornets' nest.'\r\n\r\n'Don't lose yourself, man.  In fact, you 'd better not go out of sight.\r\nIt mayn't be safe to call to each other.'\r\n\r\nThe rays of the moon, now high over the sea, lit up their immediate\r\nsurroundings.  From the cliff edge to an irregular row of palms a few\r\nyards back, low-growing plants carpeted the ground.  On one side of the\r\nchimney they were trodden down, and a faintly marked track was\r\ndiscernible until it disappeared among the trees.  No sound broke the\r\nstillness except the wash of the surf two hundred feet below, and an\r\noccasional deep booming note from some distant spot in the forest, which\r\nTrentham identified as the call of the cassowary.\r\n\r\n'\"Saved his bacon!\" Mr. Hoole said: 'tis a true word,' remarked Grinson.\r\n'Which I mean to say, you saved him from being turned into bacon,\r\nsir--or ham.  He 'd have cut up very well.'\r\n\r\nHe stood at Trentham's side, looking down at the man whom Meek was\r\ntrying to restore to consciousness--a brawny figure, clad in duck\r\ntrousers and a white flannel shirt, with a linen collar and a blue tie.\r\nHis features were heavy, his skin was deeply browned. The crown of his\r\nhead was almost entirely bald, but a thick growth of short brown hair\r\nclothed his lips, cheeks, and chin.\r\n\r\n'The very picter of Captain Lew Summers as once I sailed with,' Grinson\r\nwent on. 'How 'd he get in this mess, sir?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know,' replied Trentham.  'He hasn't said a word.'\r\n\r\nHe thought he saw the man's eyelids flicker.\r\n\r\n'He 's coming to, sir,' said Meek, from the ground.\r\n\r\n'Lift his head, Ephraim,' said Grinson. 'I 'm speckylating whether his\r\nfirst word 'll be a curse or a blessing.'\r\n\r\nThe man slowly opened his eyes, but it seemed to Trentham, watching him\r\nintently, that he had more command over himself than might have been\r\nexpected in a man recovering from a swoon.  He glanced from Meek to\r\nGrinson, then to Trentham, and raising himself on his elbows looked\r\nalong the track that led among the trees.\r\n\r\n'Feel better?' asked Trentham.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'FEEL BETTER?']\r\n\r\nFor a moment he did not reply; then slowly and with a curiously thick\r\nutterance, he said:--\r\n\r\n'Yes.  You save me?  Dank you.\r\n\r\n'Not at all.  Couldn't leave a white man in the hands of niggers, you\r\nknow.  Can you get up?'\r\n\r\n'I dink so.'  With Trentham's assistance he struggled to his feet.\r\n'Yes.  Widout you I am killed--and eat!  Ach!'\r\n\r\n'You are not an Englishman?'\r\n\r\n'Dutch.  Mate of a trade schooner dat was wrecked up de coast.'\r\n\r\n'And the rest of the crew?'\r\n\r\n'Dead--dead; all but me.  I swim strong.'\r\n\r\nGrinson glanced at the Dutchman's trousers, then at Meek.\r\n\r\n'Yes, but what good?' the man went on. 'De niggers capture me.  Widout\r\nyou, my friend--Ach!  Dey make me climb down; at de height of de\r\nmoon'--(he shuddered).  'Yes, I know dem, widout you I am killed and\r\neat. I dank you.'\r\n\r\n'Well, it was uncommonly lucky we happened to be hereabouts,' said\r\nTrentham. 'We were in a ticklish situation ourselves.'\r\n\r\n'Wrecked?'\r\n\r\nThe moonlight glinted on a pair of very keen eyes.\r\n\r\n'No, we were sunk by a German raider. The boat we got away in, four of\r\nus, only escaped a shell by a hair's breadth.  Did you sight the\r\nruffians?'\r\n\r\n'No.  My schooner was wrecked up de coast.  You escaped a shell!\r\nWonderful! And you go, where?'\r\n\r\n'We don't know.  We only got ashore yesterday, and couldn't find a way\r\nup the cliffs till we discovered this crack.'\r\n\r\n'I help you.  Yes, it is a pleasure to do something for dem what save\r\nme.  Dis coast, I know it a little.  I was here before, since ten years,\r\nwhen I come wid expedition for search of--of copper.  You listen to me;\r\nI show you.  You go to Friedrich Wilhelmshafen; it is de German\r\nport----'\r\n\r\n'Axing your pardon, mister,' Grinson interposed, 'you been a long\r\nvoyage, surely. There ain't no German ports in New Guinea nowadays, and\r\nI lay that port have got a new name that don't break your jaw to say.'\r\n\r\nThe stranger turned his eyes on Grinson for a moment, then went on:\r\n\r\n'It is a long way--a journey of eight or ten days.  I show you.  Dere is\r\nneeded great care.  De niggers--cannibals--you see dem. Always must we\r\nwatch, and wid luck--I say wid luck--we do not fall into deir hands.\r\nDey have villages along de coast--de coast is very dangerous, and we\r\nmust go drough de forest.'\r\n\r\n'Aren't there villages in the forest?' asked Trentham.\r\n\r\n'In de mountains, yes,' said the Dutchman, waving an arm towards the\r\ninterior.  'De coast and de mountains, dey must we avoid equally.'\r\n\r\n'And the niggers on the beach there--where is their village?'\r\n\r\n'On de coast somewhere, I know not where.  Dey carry me far from de\r\nplace where I was wrecked--five days.'\r\n\r\n'I 'm glad of that.  I mean I 'm glad we aren't near their place; it\r\ngives us a better chance.  Ah! here 's the fourth of our party.'\r\n\r\nHoole had just reappeared at the edge of forest.  'My name is Trentham,\r\nby the way; my friend yonder is Mr. Hoole; these friends of ours, men of\r\nyour own calling, are Mr. Grinson and Mr. Meek.'\r\n\r\n'Yes.  My name is Haan--H-a-a-n.'\r\n\r\nWondering why he had spelled the name, Trentham turned to Hoole, who had\r\njust come up.\r\n\r\n'I followed the track some distance,' said Hoole.  'Nothing doing,\r\nexcept that a fiendish leech dropped on me from a tree, I suppose, and\r\ndid himself rather well, confound him!'  He showed his wrist.  'The\r\nbeast has opened a vein, and I knew nothing about it until I got back\r\ninto the moonlight and wondered how on earth I 'd cut my wrist. But\r\nthere 's no sign of natives.'\r\n\r\nMeek heaved a sign of satisfaction.  Having introduced the Dutchman and\r\nexplained his plight, Trentham went on:\r\n\r\n'I think we had better get out of this at once.  We haven't heard a\r\nsound from below, which suggests--doesn't it?--that the savages know\r\nanother way up, probably far away. The track must lead to their village,\r\nso we 'll avoid that.  Mr. Haan knows something of the country, and has\r\noffered to guide us to--what is it?'\r\n\r\n'Friedrich Wilhelmshafen,' said Haan.\r\n\r\n'A reg'lar tongue-twister, sir,' said Grinson.  'But it 'll change its\r\nname, like a woman, for better--couldn't be for worse!'\r\n\r\n'Do we strike east or west?' asked Hoole.\r\n\r\n'East,' replied Haan.  'I dink we should go an hour or two while the\r\nmoon is up, den rest till morning.'\r\n\r\n'Are there any beasts of the earth that do go forth and seek their prey\r\nby night?' asked Meek.\r\n\r\n'Not in dis country,' the Dutchman answered.  'Dere are no dangerous\r\nbeasts except de cannibals, and dey will not walk when the moon is down.\r\nWe go, den; I show de way.'\r\n\r\nHaan gazed into the sky, then went to the brink of the cliff and looked\r\nout to sea and along the coast in both directions.\r\n\r\n'I take my bearings,' he said, returning. 'Now we start.'\r\n\r\nHe struck off almost at right angles to the native track, but instead of\r\nentering the forest strode along at a moderate pace just outside its\r\nedge, at an average distance of thirty feet from the cliff.  The rest\r\nfollowed him in single file, Trentham leading, Meek bringing up the\r\nrear.  They had taken only a few steps when Grinson halted until Meek\r\nreached his side.\r\n\r\n'Trousers!' he said in a falsetto whisper.\r\n\r\n'What did you say, Mr. Grinson?' asked Meek, dropping his voice to\r\nmatch.\r\n\r\n'Trousers, Ephraim--the Dutchman's. Didn't you notice 'em?'\r\n\r\n'Well, he do have a pair, as is only decent, but I can't truthfully say\r\nas I noticed anything partickler about their rig.'\r\n\r\n'Where are your eyes, Ephraim?  I 'm surprised at you!  He said he swam\r\nashore.'\r\n\r\n'True.  \"I swim strong,\" was his words, and I can believe it, his arms\r\nand legs being such.'\r\n\r\n'D' you believe he took his trousers off, then?  S'pose he did--wouldn't\r\nthey show? If you 'd used your eyes, Ephraim, me lad, you 'd 'a seen as\r\nthere weren't no sign of sea-water on them trousers.  'Tis my belief\r\nthey 've never been near water since they left the washtub.'\r\n\r\nMeek looked in a puzzled way into the boatswain's eyes.  Grinson winked,\r\njerked his arm in the direction of the Dutchman, then, edging a little\r\ncloser to Meek, put his head over his mouth, and whispered:\r\n\r\n'Cut the painter.'\r\n\r\n'What painter?'\r\n\r\n'Hopped the twig, as they say in the dear old New Cut where I was born.\r\nDeserted, Ephraim.'\r\n\r\n'Never!' Meek ejaculated.  'What for would he desert in a land of\r\ncannibals?'\r\n\r\n'What do men desert for?  Anything--nothing! You mind that time Ben\r\nScruddles hooked it at Noo York?  What for?'\r\n\r\n'Well, 'twas a long time ago, and I don't rightly remember, but I 'd say\r\n'twas because Ben didn't like the skipper's red hair.'\r\n\r\n'Might 'a been part of it, but the main thing was that Ben was just\r\ntired--tired o' the skipper, tired o' reg'lar hours and ever-lasting\r\ndooty, tired of every blessed thing--like a horse as jibs and swears he\r\nwon't pull the blessed cart another blessed inch. Anything for a change.\r\nI lay my life the Dutchman got it bad, and fancied a change.  Cannibals\r\nis nothing when you feel like that; I 've felt like it myself.'\r\n\r\nThey had lagged while talking, and Hoole, looking over his shoulder,\r\ncalled:\r\n\r\n'Now, men, keep up!  We don't want to lose you.  The moon 's going\r\ndown.'\r\n\r\n'Ay, ay, sir!' replied Grinson, in his usual bellow.  'Ephraim was\r\ntalking, and he never could do two things at wunst.'\r\n\r\nHaan meanwhile had trudged steadily on, making his path through the\r\nundergrowth that skirted the forest.  The rankness of the vegetation and\r\nthe uneven surface of the ground made progress very slow.  It seemed to\r\nTrentham easier going near the cliff edge, where the plants were less\r\ntall; but when he made the suggestion, Haan at once rejected it.\r\n\r\n'We go safer out of sight from de sea,' he said.\r\n\r\nOnly the swishing of their feet, a rustle as some small animal was\r\ndisturbed, now and then a squeal from among the trees, broke the deep\r\nsilence of the tropical night.  The air was chill, but walking kept the\r\nmen pleasantly warm.  Gradually the moon stole down the sky behind them,\r\nand when it had disappeared Haan called a halt.\r\n\r\n'Now we rest,' he said.  'In morning we go into de forest, until we see\r\na hill; seamen call it Mushroom Hill, because it look like one when dey\r\nsee it from de sea.  When we see it, we go quicker.'\r\n\r\nThe sailors dropped their burdens, and beat down the vegetation over a\r\nspace some twelve feet square.  Here they all stretched themselves, and\r\nmade a frugal supper.  Haan helped himself to biscuits more often than\r\nGrinson liked.  For a while the boatswain said nothing; at last,\r\nhowever, drawing the mouth of the bag together, he ventured:\r\n\r\n'Beg pardon, sir--'twas eight days, I think you said, to the port we 're\r\nmaking for?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, eight or nine,' replied Haan.\r\n\r\nGrinson pressed down the loose end of the bag, and, exhibiting the bulk,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'Biscuits won't last three, Mr. Trentham, and short rations at that.'\r\n\r\n'We get food in de forest--plenty,' said Haan.\r\n\r\n'I 'm glad to hear that,' said Trentham. 'This one bag was all that we\r\nhad time to snatch up when we took to the boat.  The old piracy was\r\ngentlemanly compared with the new.  As a seaman, Mr. Haan, you must feel\r\npretty much disgusted at the dirty tricks the Germans are playing.'\r\n\r\n'It is war,' said Haan, with a shrug.  'De ways of war, like everyding\r\nelse, dey change.'\r\n\r\n'They do indeed!' cried Trentham.  'In the old days you could fight and\r\nthen shake hands; but I 'm hanged if anybody will ever want to shake\r\nhands with a German after all this devilry!'\r\n\r\n'That's sure!' said Hoole.  'Take me for one.  I 'm a citizen of the\r\nUnited States, and war 's not precisely our trade; but after what I 've\r\nseen, I 'm going to take a hand, if any one will have me--and I get\r\nclear of this New Guinea.'\r\n\r\n'And I was on my way to join up,' added Trentham.  'The Raider has only\r\nmade me extra keen.'\r\n\r\nHaan grunted, and changed the subject by suggesting that they should\r\ntake turns in watching through the remaining hours of the night.  They\r\nwere not near a village, he thought, but it was as well to adopt\r\nprecautions in a land where enemies might lurk in every bush.  Trentham\r\nproposed that the seamen, having loads to carry, should be let off, and\r\nit was in fact arranged that the guard should be shared by Hoole, Haan,\r\nand himself. Each would have about an hour's duty.\r\n\r\nThey were not disturbed.  As soon as dawn streaked the sky they were\r\nafoot.  Haan, after a preliminary scanning of the sea and as much of the\r\ncoastline as was visible, plunged among the trees, followed in single\r\nfile by the rest.  Birds chattered with shrill cries from tree and bush,\r\nand in the half light shadowy forms darted up the trunks.  Under foot\r\nall was damp; moisture dripped from every leaf, and the air was full of\r\nthe odour of rotting vegetation.\r\n\r\n'Hadn't we better stick to the cliff?' asked Trentham, dismayed at the\r\nprospect of hours of toilsome march in such an atmosphere and with\r\ntwining plants clogging their steps.\r\n\r\n'De coast winds--we save miles and miles,' said Haan briefly.\r\n\r\nTrentham could only defer to his guide's judgment, but he felt anxious,\r\nill at ease.  He took little heed of the strange scenes through which he\r\nwas passing--the graceful palms, the fantastic screw pines, trees\r\npropped on aerial roots, trees surrounded by natural buttresses\r\nspringing from the trunk twenty feet above the ground.  He had no eye\r\nfor the orchids festooned from tree to tree, or the gorgeous blooms that\r\nhung from branches high above his head.  Many-hued parrots, white\r\ncockatoos, birds of paradise, tree kangaroos, all were barely noticed,\r\nso much preoccupied was he with troublous thought.  How could Haan find\r\nhis way through the trackless forest?  What defence had they against the\r\nnatives whom they were sure to meet sooner or later?  Could they survive\r\na week's travelling and camping in an atmosphere so fetid and unhealthy?\r\n\r\nBut he kept his thoughts to himself, and even gave a reassuring nod to\r\nGrinson, when the boatswain murmured that he saw no sign of food.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Haan told us he had been in these parts before,' he said.  'We must\r\ntrust him.'\r\n\r\nAs they penetrated deeper into the forest the undergrowth became more\r\nand more dense, and the order of their going was sometimes altered, each\r\nseeking his own path.  It usually happened that Haan assumed his place\r\nas leader very quickly; but once, when Trentham and Hoole together had\r\nforced their way through a mass of tangled vegetation, they found that\r\nthey had lost touch with him.  To their surprise, they had emerged into\r\na comparatively clear space, beyond which they caught sight of the sea,\r\na dark motionless plain under a leaden sky.  The beach was hidden from\r\nthem, but in front and to the left stretched the rugged contours of the\r\ncliffs, while to the right, behind the trees, rose the tops of lofty\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nThey were about to call for Haan, when Hoole's eye was arrested by a\r\ncloud of smoke rising from beyond the edge of the cliff.\r\n\r\n'By gum, Trentham!' he exclaimed.  'Is there a steamer below there?\r\nLet's have a look!'\r\n\r\nThey went a few paces forward, and had just caught sight of a number of\r\ndark figures moving up and down what appeared to be a steep slope,\r\nperhaps a mile away, near the cloud, when Haan came panting up behind\r\nthem, and unceremoniously pulled them back.\r\n\r\n'Shust in time!' he said in a husky whisper, rapidly, with every sign of\r\nagitation. 'Vy--vy--vy did you leave me?  You vill ruin every zing!'\r\n\r\n'Sorry!' said Trentham, as the man continued to draw them back.  'What's\r\nthe matter?'\r\n\r\n'Shust in time!' repeated the Dutchman, as if to himself; then, aloud,\r\nand with his former slow, careful utterance: 'Dere, between us and dat\r\nplace, is de village of dose niggers what capture me.'\r\n\r\n'That accounts for the smoke,' remarked Hoole.  'We 've escaped making a\r\nbad bloomer, seemingly.'\r\n\r\n'My word, shust in time!' said Haan. 'If I had not come!  Dose\r\nniggers--you saw dem--wild men, noding can tame dem, cannibals,\r\nferocious--if dey had seen us, dere would soon be noding of us but our\r\nbones. Never, never leave me again!'\r\n\r\n'It was quite accidental, Mr. Haan,' said Trentham.  'The bush was so\r\nthick----'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes,' said the man impatiently, 'but we gain no time going\r\nseparate.  I lead, you follow--remember dat!'\r\n\r\nTrentham was inclined to resent a certain peremptoriness in the\r\nDutchman's tone, but, catching Hoole's eye, he held his peace.\r\n\r\n'He 's a bit unstrung,' whispered Hoole, as they returned to the spot\r\nwhere Haan had left the seamen, 'and I don't wonder.  He doesn't want to\r\nfall into their clutches a second time.'\r\n\r\nHaan quickly recovered his equanimity, and for nearly two hours they\r\nplodded on through the forest, keeping, apparently, the coast behind\r\nthem.  Then suddenly, through a break in the trees, the expected\r\nlandmark loomed up on their left hand.\r\n\r\n'Dat is Mushroom Hill,' said Haan.  'We now go quicker.  We go round de\r\nhill on de north side, and go quicker still--and safer. De niggers on de\r\noder side are not so fierce; dey do not eat men.  Why?  Dey are nearer\r\nFriedrich Wilhelmshafen, and dey have felt de weight of de German hand.'\r\n\r\n'Poor devils!' said Trentham involuntarily, and surprised a strange look\r\nthat gleamed for an instant in the Dutchman's eyes.\r\n\r\n'Say, how far away is that hill of yours, Mr. Haan?' asked Hoole.\r\n\r\n'Forty miles.  We take dree days.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I guess we 'll take a little food first. We shall have to rely on\r\nour biscuits; we haven't happened on any orchards yet.'\r\n\r\n'Plenty bread-fruit yonder,' said Haan, waving his arm towards the hill,\r\n'and coco-palms, and pawpaws.  Yes, we eat our lunch and rest.  De sun\r\nis bursting drough; it will be very hot.  Last night we sleep little.  A\r\nnap--forty vinks you call it--will refresh us, den we go stronger.'\r\n\r\n'A capital idea!' said Trentham.  'I say, Mr. Haan, it was lucky you\r\nfound us when you did.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Haan drily.  'But we must still be on guard.  We must not\r\nall sleep togeder.'\r\n\r\n'Of course not.  We 'll take turns again--we three.  Let the men off.\r\nThey have the hardest job, though their loads will be lighter when we\r\nstart again.  I 'll take first watch, then you, Hoole.  Mr. Haan must be\r\nmore tired than we two.'\r\n\r\n'It is no matter,' remarked Haan, 'and I am used to a hard life.  I can\r\nstand fatigue better than you two young gentlemen.  But certainly I can\r\nsleep wid pleasure.  Two hours--dat will give forty minutes each. Yes;\r\nand I haf no watch; de niggers strip off my coat.  You wake me, Mr.\r\nHoole, and lend me your watch, so I wake you; and I give you no more dan\r\nforty minutes--not one second.'\r\n\r\nHe laughed in a clumsily roguish way. They cleared a space and sat down\r\nto their meal of biscuits and water.  Haan was the first to throw\r\nhimself on his back, his bald head shaded by the spreading\r\ncandelabra-like branches of a screw pine.  The rest were not slaw to\r\nfollow his example, except Trentham, who sat on the keg, and lit a\r\ncigarette to keep himself awake.\r\n\r\nEighty minutes later Hoole, having completed his spell of watching,\r\ntouched Haan lightly on the shoulder.  The man did not stir.  He tickled\r\nhis ear with a spray of some feathery plant; Haan slept on.\r\n\r\n'I 'll give him another five minutes,' thought Hoole, yawning.\r\n\r\nAt the end of that time, by dint of poking Haan in the ribs and pinching\r\nhis nose, he succeeded in waking the Dutchman.\r\n\r\n'Awfully sorry!' he said, 'but I can scarcely keep my eyes open.  Here\r\n's my watch; be sure and not let me oversleep.'\r\n\r\nHaan got up.  His movements were slow and clumsy, but his eyes were keen\r\nand alert.\r\n\r\n'Forty minutes, Mr. Hoole,' he said with a smile.  'Not a second more.'\r\n\r\nHe did not sit on the keg as Hoole and Trentham had done, but posted\r\nhimself a few paces from the rest of the party, at a spot where the\r\nground rose slightly.  Hoole, just before he closed his eyes, saw the\r\nstout figure pacing slowly up and down.\r\n\r\nRather more than two hours afterwards Meek, in his sleep, threw out his\r\nleft leg, and dealt Grinson, who lay at his side, a smart kick on the\r\nshin.\r\n\r\n'Belay, there!' shouted Grinson, starting up.  'What swab--what dirty\r\nlubber----'\r\n\r\n''Twas a nightmare, Mr. Grinson,' said Meek penitently.  'I dreamt as a\r\nkangaroo was a-coming to peck me, and----'\r\n\r\n'Peck you!  A goose might----'\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked around.  Hoole and Trentham were a few yards away,\r\nfast asleep. Haan was not in sight.\r\n\r\n'Whose watch is this, Ephraim?' asked Grinson.\r\n\r\n'I can't rightly say, but seeing as the two gentlemen be asleep, I can't\r\nhelp thinking 'tis the Dutchman's.'\r\n\r\nGrinson got up.\r\n\r\n'If so be he was a landsman,' he said, 'he might be doing a beat like a\r\nbobby; but a seaman ought to know better.'\r\n\r\nHe walked to the left, then to the right, followed by Meek.\r\n\r\n'Can't see the chap, nor hear him.  What d' you make of it, Ephraim?'\r\n\r\n'He can't have fell overboard--must have strayed.  Give him a hail with\r\nyour powerful voice, Mr. Grinson.  Save us all!  I forgot the cannibals!\r\nDon't holler, for mercy's sake!'\r\n\r\n'I nearly did, but you 're right, Ephraim. I 'll report to the skipper,\r\nwhich I mean Mr. Trentham.'\r\n\r\n'Eh--what?  The Dutchman absent from his post?' said Trentham sleepily,\r\nwhen Grinson had roused him.  'Hoole, wake up!'\r\n\r\n'Sure I haven't been asleep forty minutes yet,' said Hoole.  'And I gave\r\nHaan five minutes extra.'\r\n\r\n'Where _is_ Haan?'\r\n\r\n'Where is he?  He was over there.'\r\n\r\n'Grinson says he 's missing.'\r\n\r\n'Missing!  But----'  He felt for his watch.  'What's the time?  I lent\r\nhim my watch.'\r\n\r\n'Ten past four.'\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\nTrentham showed him his watch.\r\n\r\n'Ten past four!  It was two when I gave it him!  What the deuce----'\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and stared blankly at Trentham.\r\n\r\n'What did I say, Ephraim, me lad?' said Grinson, in what he intended for\r\na whisper.\r\n\r\n'What's that, Grinson?' demanded Trentham.  'What _did_ you say?'\r\n\r\n'Well, sir, as we come along, Meek and me was saying a few things about\r\nthe Dutchman's trousers, and seeing as they 'd no mark of being in\r\nsea-water, it come into my head that he didn't get ashore swimming.  And\r\nfrom that--which I know the little ways o' seamen--I somehow couldn't\r\nhelp guessing that he might 'a got restless like, and hopped the twig.'\r\n\r\n'Deserted his ship, sir,' explained Meek.\r\n\r\n'Got a bit wild like, and gone a-roaming,' added Grinson.  'Seemingly\r\nhe's got it again.'\r\n\r\n'Nonsense!' exclaimed Trentham.  'He isn't an ass!'\r\n\r\n'Guess we 'd better look for him,' said Hoole.  'He 's got my watch.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                              IN THE TOILS\r\n\r\n\r\nTrentham looked round.  Mushroom Hill reared its strange form into the\r\nsky on their left hand--forty miles away, Haan had said.  Between it and\r\nthem stretched unbroken forest, an undulating sea of green.  There was\r\nforest on their right, in front, behind.\r\n\r\n'It's like looking for the proverbial needle in the bundle of hay,' he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n'But we might track him through the undergrowth,' suggested Hoole.  'He\r\ncouldn't pass without leaving traces--a big fellow, with big boots.'\r\n\r\n'Yes; a solid-looking fellow, too; not the kind of man to do anything so\r\nmad as Grinson suggests.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, sir, 'tis them as are the worst when the feeling gets a hold,' said\r\nGrinson.  'There was once a messmate o' mine, Job Grindle by name----'\r\n\r\n'Really we must lose no time,' Trentham interrupted.  'The sun will be\r\ndown in two hours or less.  He was on that side, Hoole? Then let us\r\nstart from there, and all keep together.'\r\n\r\nThey examined the slight eminence where Hoole had last seen the\r\nDutchman.  The plants were beaten down over a space of a few yards,\r\nwhere the man had walked to and fro; but beyond this narrow area there\r\nwas no sign of footsteps in any direction.\r\n\r\n'Very odd,' said Trentham.  'He must have gone back the way we came.'\r\n\r\nThey retraced their steps towards the clearly marked track of their\r\ncourse through the forest.\r\n\r\n''Tis my belief the cannibals come up and cotched him again,' said Meek.\r\n\r\n'But they must have passed us before they reached him,' said Trentham.\r\n'He would have sung out.'\r\n\r\n'And even if they took him by surprise a big fellow like him wouldn't\r\nhave been overpowered without a struggle,' added Hoole. 'There 's no\r\nsign of it.  And they would hardly have been satisfied with one victim\r\nwhen they might have had five.  I guess Grinson is right, after all.\r\nNow let us look at the proposition from that point of view. Say that\r\nHaan was seized with the roaming fever--that is, was more or less mad.\r\nThere's a deal of cunning in madmen, and he 'd naturally try to cover up\r\nhis tracks.  He would expect us to go back over our course, so that's\r\nthe very way he wouldn't go. What do you say?'\r\n\r\n'It sounds reasonable, but where are his tracks?  How could he cover\r\nthem?'\r\n\r\n'Let's go back to where I last saw him.  I have an idea.'\r\n\r\nRetracing their steps to the rising ground, they examined once more the\r\nfew yards which Haan had trodden.  Beyond this clear space trees of\r\nvarious species grew somewhat thickly together.  Hoole went up to them\r\nand began to look closely at the trunks.\r\n\r\n'Ah, maybe he 's sitting up aloft a-grinning at us,' said Grinson,\r\npeering up into the foliage--'for a joke, like.'\r\n\r\n'I never could understand a joke,' murmured Meek.\r\n\r\n'Here you are,' cried Hoole, laying his hand on a twisted and knobby\r\ntrunk.  'He shinned up here.'\r\n\r\nThere were on the bark scratches that might have been made by nails in a\r\nheavy sole.  But Haan was not discoverable amid the leaves above.\r\n\r\n'The madman!' exclaimed Trentham.\r\n\r\n'With a madman's cunning,' said Hoole. 'Clearly he wanted to throw us\r\noff, and he deserves to be left to his fate.  But, of course, we can't\r\nleave him to his fate.  I suppose he went from tree to tree, and then\r\ndropped to earth again when he thought he had done us.  It would be a\r\nhopeless job to attempt to track him through the foliage; but we know\r\nthe direction in which he went, and I dare say we 'll find his traces\r\nnot far away.  Let us go on; scatter a little; the forest isn't thick\r\nhereabouts, and we can see each other a few yards apart.  If we don't\r\nfind him by nightfall, we shall simply have to give it up, camp for the\r\nnight, and then make tracks for Mushroom Hill.'\r\n\r\nFollowing his suggestion, they went forward in a line, looking up into\r\nthe foliage, and closely examining the undergrowth for signs of its\r\nhaving been trampled down. Every now and then they stopped to listen;\r\nthey dared not shout, but Hoole sometimes ventured upon a low whistle.\r\n\r\nAfter they had progressed slowly for about half an hour, Meek suddenly\r\nsniffed, and caught Grinson by the arm.\r\n\r\n'Summat burning, Mr. Grinson,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Well, you 've a long nose, Ephraim. You 're right, me lad; I smell it\r\nmyself.'  He coughed lightly to attract the attention of Trentham, a few\r\nyards on his right.  The four men grouped themselves.  Hoole took out\r\nhis revolver.  They stood in silence, listening, looking in the\r\ndirection from which the smell of burning came.  There was no sound of\r\ncrackling, no sign of smoke, and after a minute or two they went forward\r\ncautiously.\r\n\r\nSoon they halted in astonishment.  They had come upon a stretch of\r\nblackened undergrowth, upon which lay a few trees that bore the mark of\r\nan axe; others, still erect, were black for many feet from their base.\r\nThe air was full of the smell of burnt wood.\r\n\r\n'Surely the madman didn't set fire to the trees?' said Trentham.\r\n\r\n'This wasn't done to-day,' said Hoole, touching a blackened trunk.\r\n'It's not hot. But it wasn't long ago.  Look here; the remains of a\r\nladder.'\r\n\r\nHe had picked up at the foot of a tree what was clearly the charred\r\nremnant of a ladder of bamboo.\r\n\r\n'Bless my eyes, sir, 'tis a village,' said Grinson.  'When I was at\r\nMoresby some years ago they showed me a photograph of one--a tree\r\nvillage, the little houses perched up aloft, and ladders to get to 'em.\r\nThere 's been a fire, that's clear.'\r\n\r\n'And no fire-engine,' said Meek.  'A terrible calamity, to be sure.'\r\n\r\nHoole had gone a few steps ahead.\r\n\r\n'Here 's the sea,' he called.  'We 're on the edge of a cliff.  And by\r\nJove!  Trentham, look here!'\r\n\r\nThe others went forward and joined him. They looked down upon a narrow\r\nravine--a steep valley such as is called a chine in the South of\r\nEngland.  At the foot of the thickly wooded banks a stream flowed out\r\ninto a small bay almost landlocked by high cliffs.  And in the middle of\r\nthe bay lay a vessel--a long blue shape with a single funnel.\r\n\r\n'The Raider!' ejaculated Grinson with an oath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'THE RAIDER!']\r\n\r\n'I guess you 're right,' said Hoole quietly. 'And there 's that cloud of\r\nsmoke we saw in the distance this morning.'\r\n\r\nA slight dark cloud was rising above the cliff near the vessel.  It did\r\nnot proceed from the Raider's funnel.  Was it possible that a consort of\r\nhers lay beyond the point?\r\n\r\nThe four men, standing just within the forest verge, gazed for a few\r\nmoments in silence at this unexpected scene.  Then Trentham turned.\r\n\r\n'We had better get back--to where we can see Mushroom Hill,' he said, a\r\ngrave note in his voice.\r\n\r\n'And give up Haan?' said Hoole.\r\n\r\n'And give up Haan.  Haan may go hang. Let us go at once; it 'll be dark\r\nsoon.'\r\n\r\nThey retraced their steps through the burnt village, Hoole and Trentham\r\nwalking side by side, the two seamen following.\r\n\r\n'I wondered why the fellow spelt his name to us; you remember?\r\nH-a-a-n,' said Trentham. 'It's clear as daylight now.  He 's a German;\r\nwas on that raider; a petty officer, I suppose; his name 's Hahn.'\r\n\r\nHoole whistled under his breath.\r\n\r\n'They played some devilry with the natives, I suppose,' Trentham went\r\non; 'burnt their village, very likely; Hahn strayed and got\r\ncollared--and we saved one of the ruffians who sunk us!'\r\n\r\n'And he 's got away and rejoined--with my watch!' cried Hoole.  'What an\r\nalmighty fool I was!  And I gave him five minutes' extra sleep!  That\r\nstings, Trentham, and will till my dying day.'\r\n\r\n'He beat us: in slimness the Hun always will.  I haven't a doubt he was\r\nplaying tricks with us all the time.  His Mushroom Hill--faugh!'\r\n\r\n'You mean?'\r\n\r\n'I mean that I don't believe that's our way at all.  He reckoned on our\r\ngetting hopelessly lost--starving--falling into the hands of the\r\nsavages.'\r\n\r\n'Well, for my part, I 'd as soon fall into their hands as the Germans'.\r\nYou don't think he 'll send the Huns after us, then?'\r\n\r\n'Not he!  I don't suppose he 'll mention us, thinking us well out of the\r\nway.  He 'll probably pitch some tall yarn about his clever escape from\r\nthe cannibals--very likely write a book about it.  Upon my word, Hoole,\r\nafter what we know----'\r\n\r\n'Well, I reckon we 're done pretty brown, but I 'm not inclined to give\r\nhim best.  We 'll get to Friedrich What-do-you-call-it in spite of him,\r\nand not by Mushroom Hill either. We 'll stick to the coast--confound\r\nhim! He was so precious careful to keep us away from it.'\r\n\r\n'We can only try; it's a ticklish affair, Hoole.'\r\n\r\n'I know it is, old son.  The food question.'\r\n\r\n'Don't worry about that.  Where there are men there must be food.'\r\n\r\n'That's true; but I 'd rather find the food where there weren't men, if\r\nthe men are like those dancing hoodlums on the beach.  One thing; the\r\nHun's frightfulness has probably scared away all the natives from these\r\nparts, so we 'll be able to rest in peace to-night and start afresh in\r\nthe morning.'\r\n\r\n'I hope so.  We had better camp where Hahn left us; I 'll tell the men\r\nthere.'\r\n\r\nThey went on over their former tracks.  A wind was rising, and the\r\nfoliage overhead rustled like the hissing of breakers on a shingly\r\nbeach.  Conversation ceased; each was busy with his own uneasy thoughts.\r\nThe rays of the setting sun filtered through the trees from behind them,\r\nand presently they came in sight of the open space where Hahn had\r\ndeserted them.  And then the two young men suddenly halted; Trentham\r\nwheeled round and put his fingers over his lips in sight of the seamen.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the clearing, just where Grinson had lain, a dark,\r\nnaked figure was stooping and closely examining the ground. He had his\r\nback to them, but a moment after they had stopped he sprang up suddenly\r\nand turned towards them, his head raised like that of a wild animal that\r\nscents danger.  For a few moments he stood motionless in the full glow\r\nof the sunlight--a tall lithe figure, like a statue in bronze.  His\r\nright hand clutched a spear.\r\n\r\nThe watchers had time to notice his well-proportioned form; his colour,\r\nlighter than that of the natives they had already seen; a grace of\r\nbearing that gave him an indefinable distinction; then he was gone, as\r\nif by magic.  Where he had been he was no longer; it was as if he had\r\ndissolved like Pepper's ghost.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a little, Hoole stole forward to reconnoitre.  The space\r\nwas vacant; there was no sign of savages lurking among the surrounding\r\ntrees.  He returned to the others.\r\n\r\n'No one there,' he said under his breath.\r\n\r\n'D' you think he saw us?' asked Trentham.\r\n\r\n'No.  I couldn't see you from the edge. But he was uneasy.'\r\n\r\n'So am I!  We had better avoid that spot. I 'd rather not meet any more\r\nnatives just yet!  We had better go rather deeply into the forest, and\r\nperch up in trees for the night. There 's only about half an hour of\r\ndaylight left; we shall probably be pretty safe in the dark.  In\r\ndaylight--well, we shall have to look out.'\r\n\r\nThey had spoken in whispers.  The seamen had watched them anxiously;\r\nGrinson, usually talkative enough, had not uttered a word for some time.\r\nTrentham in a few sentences explained his plan; then led the way with\r\nHoole into the forest, in a direction at right angles to their former\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe dying sunlight scarcely penetrated the thick canopy above them.  The\r\ngreenish gloom lent pallor to their cheeks.  They stumbled, on through\r\nthe brushwood, which grew more densely where the overhead leafage was\r\nthin.  The wind had dropped as suddenly as it had arisen.  They heard\r\nnothing but the swish of their feet through the vegetation and the\r\nfitful calls of night birds just awaking. Presently, however, Hoole\r\nstopped and whispered:\r\n\r\n'Did you hear that?'\r\n\r\n'What?'\r\n\r\n'Some sound--I don't know what.'\r\n\r\n'I heard nothing.'\r\n\r\nThey went on.\r\n\r\n'There again!' said Hoole, a few seconds later.  He looked round\r\napprehensively.  A slight groan came from Meek.\r\n\r\n'What's the matter?' asked Trentham in a whisper, sharply.  His nerves\r\nwere a little on edge.\r\n\r\n'I seed a face, sir,' murmured the man, staring into the gloom.\r\n\r\n'Nonsense!  It's too dark to see anything. We 'll stop in a few minutes,\r\nwhen it's quite dark; but we must get as far as we can from where we saw\r\nthat native.'\r\n\r\nThey had not advanced more than a dozen yards when Hoole made a sudden\r\ndash among the bushes.  The rest halted, drawing quick breaths.  He came\r\nback after half a minute's absence.\r\n\r\n'I distinctly heard a sound there,' he explained.  'No; it's not\r\njumpiness.  But I couldn't see any one or anything.  I vote we stop,\r\nTrentham.  We shall lose our bearings utterly if we go too far into the\r\nforest, where we can't see the sun to-morrow.'\r\n\r\n'I think you 're right.  Now to find trees we can climb, and big enough\r\nto give us safe perches.  Grinson, put down your bag and have a look\r\nround.'\r\n\r\nThe boatswain had just risen from stooping to the ground; the others\r\nwere standing by, looking up for broad forks which promised security,\r\nwhen with a sudden _whish_ that took them all aback the brushwood around\r\nthem parted and a score or more of dusky natives burst into the ring.\r\nBefore they could raise a finger in self-defence they were thrown\r\nheadlong, and sinewy hands were knotting pliant tendrils about their\r\narms and legs, while others held them down.  In a few minutes the\r\nbinding was finished.  The captors collected, and jabbered away among\r\nthemselves.  One of them had opened the bag, and was munching a biscuit.\r\nThe bag was wrenched from his hands; and the four prisoners, lying on\r\ntheir backs, watched the gleeful savages consume their whole stock of\r\nprovisions to the last crumb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SCORE OF DUSKY NATIVES BURST INTO THE RING.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                               THE TOTEM\r\n\r\n\r\n'They won't eat us now, will they, Mr. Grinson?' said Meek in a whisper,\r\nhopefully.\r\n\r\nGrinson swore.\r\n\r\n'Not after them biscuits, Mr. Grinson?' Meek persisted.\r\n\r\n'Stow it, can't you?' growled Grinson. 'This ain't a time for jokes.'\r\n\r\nMeek was so much astonished at being accused of joking that his jaw\r\ndropped, and he eyed the boatswain sadly.  His expression turned to\r\nanguish as he listened to the low-toned conversation between Hoole and\r\nTrentham.\r\n\r\n'We 're fairly in the cart,' said the former. 'See any way out?'\r\n\r\n'No.  We 're still alive.  They might have killed us--those spears!'\r\n\r\n'Better if they had, perhaps.  Waiting is the deuce!'\r\n\r\n'If we could only speak to them!'\r\n\r\n'Try right now.  Perhaps some of them know pidgin.'\r\n\r\n'You boys belongina this place?' began Trentham in loud tones.  'You\r\nsavvy English fella?  English he like him black fella man too much, come\r\nthis place look out black fella man, no fighting black fella man.'\r\n\r\nThe natives had stopped jabbering.\r\n\r\n'You savvy all same what English fella man he say?' Trentham asked.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.  The Papuans, squatting in a line, gave an\r\ninarticulate grunt, then resumed their talk.\r\n\r\n'No good!' said Trentham.  'They evidently haven't been to the ports.\r\nVery little chance for us with savages of the interior.'\r\n\r\n'What are they waiting for, then?  Look, that's the fellow we saw a\r\nwhile ago.'\r\n\r\nThe young native whom they had seen examining their tracks came out of\r\nthe gloom, stood before the squatting men, and spoke to them.  They\r\nstared at the four prisoners and grunted; the speaker disappeared among\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\n'He 's left them on guard, and gone to report at headquarters,' said\r\nTrentham.  'A brief respite.'\r\n\r\n'Till the rising of the moon, I suppose. Well, old boy, I hope it 'll be\r\nshort--and both together.'\r\n\r\nTrentham was silent.  He had had many anxious moments since the Raider's\r\nfirst shell had flown screaming over the deck; but it was with a shock\r\nof a totally different kind that he now found himself looking with open\r\neyes upon the imminence of death.  To a man in health death is\r\nunrealisable.  But he remembered those hideous figures on the beach, the\r\npig's squeal, and he shuddered.\r\n\r\nThere was barely light enough to distinguish the savages from their\r\nsurroundings; but it seemed to him, from their general appearance, that\r\nthey were of the same tribe as the dancers--possibly they were the\r\ndancers themselves.  In that case, baulked of one victim, they were only\r\ntoo likely to make the most of the four who had now fallen into their\r\nhands.  It was not to be hoped that they would relax their watchfulness.\r\nWould their leader return at the rising of the moon?\r\n\r\nComplete darkness enwrapped them.  The blacks talked on endlessly,\r\nbreaking at times into boisterous laughter.\r\n\r\n'Have you tried the knots, Grinson?' Trentham asked.\r\n\r\n'Did that first go off, sir,' replied the boatswain in doleful accents.\r\n'I couldn't have tied 'em better myself.'\r\n\r\nEach of the prisoners had in fact already wriggled and strained at his\r\nbonds, with total unsuccess.\r\n\r\nThey lay silent again.  Presently Grinson let out a torrent of\r\nexpletives with something like his old vigour.  The others questioned\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'Skeeters!' he cried furiously.  'They 're all over me, and I can't rub\r\nmy nose.'\r\n\r\nHitherto insects had troubled them little, and the advent of mosquitoes\r\nwas likely to enhance their physical discomfort.\r\n\r\n'I guess we 're near water,' remarked Hoole; 'perhaps that stream we saw\r\nrunning into the bay.  Have the mosquitoes bit you, Trentham?'\r\n\r\n'Not yet.'\r\n\r\n'Nor me.  They 've taken a fancy for Grinson.'\r\n\r\n'I 'm willing they should have a bite at me,' said Meek, 'if so be they\r\n'd let Mr. Grinson alone.'\r\n\r\nGrinson swore again; in his present mood Meek's devotion was only less\r\nirritating than the stabs of the insects.\r\n\r\nA glint of moonlight stole through the trees, and revealed the faces of\r\nsome of the natives--ugly faces of rusty black, daubed with red and\r\nwhite.  The prisoners felt their heart-beats quicken.  But though the\r\nmoonbeams lengthened the savages made no move, nor did their leader\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThe hours dragged on.  One after another the four men slumbered\r\nuneasily, waking with sudden starts and tremors, always to hear the\r\nharsh voices of their guards. Towards morning they slept heavily, and\r\nwere only awakened by the touch of hands upon their legs.  In the dim\r\ngreenish light they saw that the savages had been rejoined by the young\r\nman who had left them in the evening, and by another native resembling\r\nhim, but a good deal older, wearing a high plume of feathers.  The bonds\r\nabout the prisoners' legs were released; they were hauled to their feet,\r\nand the two leaders made signs that they were to march.  So cramped that\r\nthey could scarcely move their limbs, they followed their leaders; the\r\nPapuan guards, all armed with spears, tramping in single file behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n'Your poor face is all swollen, Mr. Grinson,' said Meek, with a look of\r\ncommiseration.\r\n\r\n'Shut _your_ face!' growled the boatswain ill-temperedly.\r\n\r\nWith their arms still bound firmly to their sides, the prisoners, faint\r\nwith hunger, stumbled through the forest, at the heels of the two\r\nleaders, along a well-worn track.  It crossed deeply wooded ravines,\r\nshallow streams; wound round steep bluffs on which no trees grew.\r\nPresently they came to a wide clearing where naked children were running\r\nabout, and women were busy with cooking.  At their appearance, men came\r\nscrambling down ladders from the trees beyond, exchanged a few excited\r\nwords with their escort, and, shouting with delight, joined themselves\r\nto the party.\r\n\r\n'Quite a Roman triumph,' said Hoole with a sickly smile.\r\n\r\n'Roman?' said Trentham, roused from the listlessness into which he had\r\nfallen. 'Those fellows in front might almost be Romans, bar the colour.'\r\n\r\n'They 're a better breed than the crowd behind.  Don't look like\r\ncannibals.'\r\n\r\n'D' ye hear that?' Meek whispered to Grinson. 'Mr. Hoole says they ain't\r\ncannibals.'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Hoole won't be the fust,' growled the boatswain.\r\n\r\nMeek was half a minute or so in seeing the connection between Grinson's\r\nreply and his own statement.  When light dawned, he contemplated the\r\nboatswain's rotundity with mournful composure.\r\n\r\nThe procession was swelled by accretions from two more villages during\r\nthe next hour. Some of the new-comers pressed close to the prisoners,\r\nnow almost overcome by heat, hunger, and weariness, and discussed them\r\nexcitedly.  Hoole and Trentham walked on with nonchalant disregard; Meek\r\nwore a deprecating look; Grinson turned upon them a truculent\r\ncountenance, disfigured by the mosquitoes' attentions.\r\n\r\nAnother hour had passed; the captives were on the verge of collapse,\r\neven Grinson's face had lost its ruddy hue, when, emerging from the\r\nforest, they found themselves in a clearing several acres in extent,\r\ndivided off into plots on which crops of various kinds were growing.\r\nBeyond stood a line of neatly thatched huts, and in the distance was\r\nwhat appeared to be a closely built stockade.  A broad road ran through\r\nthe midst of the settlement.  At the approach of the procession, now\r\nsome sixty strong, women and children flocked from the fields and\r\ngathered, wondering spectators, on the road, and men sprang up from the\r\nground in front of the huts, and hastened to meet the new-comers.\r\n\r\nThe elder of the two leaders turned round and shouted a few words.  All\r\nbut ten of the Papuans halted.  The ten continued their march behind the\r\nprisoners, through a lane between two of the huts, until they arrived at\r\na narrow gateway in the stockade.  This, on nearer view, proved to be a\r\nformidable wall of pandanus trunks cemented with earth, and with an\r\nearthen parapet that bore a strange resemblance to the machicolations of\r\na mediaeval castle.\r\n\r\nThe gate was thrown open; the two leaders, the prisoners, and their\r\nescort passed through, and the scene that met the white men's eyes\r\nfilled them with astonishment. On either side stood a row of neat wooden\r\nhouses with gabled roofs and long window openings.  The woodwork showed\r\ncrude attempts at decoration in red and white.  In the centre was a\r\nlarger, loftier building than the rest, also of wood, but constructed\r\nlike a rough imitation of a castle keep.\r\n\r\nWithin this inner enclosure there were none but men, all of good\r\nstature, well proportioned, and with the arched nose and straight hair\r\nwhich the prisoners had remarked in the two leaders of the procession.\r\nIn colour they were a bright bronze, contrasting forcibly with the\r\nlustreless black of the Papuan escort.\r\n\r\nA few yards from the central building the prisoners were halted, and the\r\nyoung leader went forward alone, disappearing within an arched doorway.\r\nIn a few minutes he returned, accompanied by a tall old man with white\r\nhair and wrinkled brow, naked like the others, except for a broader\r\nloin-cloth and a heavy gold chain, curiously wrought, about his neck.\r\n\r\n'\"The noblest Roman of them all!\"' quoted Hoole, under his breath.\r\n'Where on earth are we?'\r\n\r\nThe apprehensions of all the prisoners, were for the moment smothered by\r\nsurprise and wonderment.\r\n\r\nAt the appearance of the old man in the doorway, the ten Papuans fell on\r\none knee, like courtiers before a king.  The chief gazed fixedly at the\r\nwhite men, appraising them one after another.  A cruel smile dawned upon\r\nhis face--a smile that in an instant revived in the prisoners the worst\r\nof their fears.  During the march Trentham had buoyed himself with the\r\nhope that these natives of a higher type might turn out to be friendly;\r\nthe hope died within him now. The chief had evidently heard all about\r\nthe prisoners from the young man who had visited him during the night.\r\nHe had now come to pronounce their doom.\r\n\r\n'Rhadamanthus,' murmured Hoole.  'Try him with pidgin, Trentham.  He\r\nhasn't heard our defence.'\r\n\r\n'Chief, we English fella,' cried Trentham. 'Come this side look out\r\nblack fella man; no fighting this time.'\r\n\r\nThe old man beckoned to one of the men who had come from the houses\r\nright and left, and now stood spectators of the scene.  The man came\r\nforward, and after the chief had addressed a few words to him in his own\r\ntongue, he said to Trentham:\r\n\r\n'White fella man no belongina this place. White fella man come this\r\nplace, make fire houses belongina black fella man, fight black fella man\r\nall same too much; white man he belongina die.'\r\n\r\nTrentham understood from this that he and his friends were supposed to\r\nbe connected with the white men who had recently burnt the tree village\r\nand ill-treated the natives.\r\n\r\n'We no belongina bad fella man,' he hastened to explain.  'Like you\r\nfella, no like bad fella come ship stop this place; ship no belongina\r\nme.'\r\n\r\nThe interpreter translated to the chief, who listened with a derisive\r\nair, shrugged his shoulders, and threw out his hands, and made answer:\r\n\r\n'Chief he say all belongina gammon: you come all same place other white\r\nfella man, no look out good alonga him.  He finish talk alonga you.'\r\n\r\n'The Huns have queered our pitch,' said Trentham to Hoole, with a wry\r\nsmile.  'We are at their mercy.'\r\n\r\n'Wish I had my hands free,' said Hoole. 'What's the end to be?'\r\n\r\nOne of the Papuans, with every sign of humility, was addressing the\r\nchief.  Into the old man's eyes crept the cruel smile which had already\r\ncaused the prisoners to shiver.  He spoke a few words; the Papuans\r\nsprang up gleefully, crowded about the white men, and jabbered with\r\nexcitement.  They gave scarcely a glance at Meek, who stood in his usual\r\ndrooping attitude, open-eyed with fright.  They stared critically at the\r\ntwo younger men, seemed to dispute for a few moments, then turned to\r\nGrinson and began to poke him in the ribs.  The boatswain glared,\r\ncursed, kicked, only to be caught by the leg and thrown to the ground.\r\nHoole and Trentham made a movement towards him, but were instantly\r\nseized by the natives standing by.  After a vain struggle, Grinson lay\r\ninert.  The Papuans hauled him to his feet, and marched him away towards\r\nthe gate.\r\n\r\n'Good-bye, Mr. Trentham; good-bye, Mr. Hoole!' he shouted.  'So long,\r\nEphraim, me lad!  The anchor's weighed.  Remember me.'\r\n\r\nPale to the lips, the three others watched the chief as he followed the\r\nindomitable seaman with his eyes.  When the gate was shut he turned to\r\nthe young native who had first discovered the white men, and spoke to\r\nhim, using, as it appeared to Trentham, a dialect differing somewhat\r\nfrom that in which he had addressed the Papuan and the interpreter.  Now\r\nand then it had a nasal quality that reminded Trentham of French, and\r\npresently he caught a word or two that sounded like debased forms of\r\nFrench words he knew.\r\n\r\nA drowning man will catch at a straw, and Trentham, incredible though it\r\nappeared that the natives hereabout should be familiar with French, as a\r\nlast hope determined to try the effect of a word or two in that\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n'_Monsieur parle francais?_' he said, using the first phrase that\r\noccurred to him, and anxiously watching the chief.\r\n\r\nBoth the old man and the young looked at him with astonishment.\r\n\r\n'_Monsieur parle francais?_' he repeated.\r\n\r\n'_Oui, flancais,_' said the chief, and went on speaking in a gibberish\r\nwhich, though it had a French intonation, was utterly incomprehensible\r\nto Trentham.\r\n\r\n'_Nous sommes amis des Francais,_' he said.\r\n\r\n'_Oui, amis,_' echoed the chief, and talked on.  Then, apparently seeing\r\nthat Trentham was bewildered, he called up the interpreter, and spoke to\r\nhim in the Papuan dialect he had formerly used.\r\n\r\n'Chief he say you savvy him talk, say you come this place belongina\r\nship.  What for come this place?'\r\n\r\nTrentham almost despaired of finding his resources of pidgin English\r\nsuffice to explain the situation of himself and his companions. But\r\nconscious how much depended on him, he did his best.\r\n\r\n'Me belongina English ship; bad fella belongina another ship, he\r\nfighting me, no more ship.  He no like white fella man; come fight this\r\ntime black fella belongina all place. English fella man like Flansai\r\nfella, no like Toitsche fella--you savvy all same?'\r\n\r\nHe clenched his fist, and shook it in the direction where he supposed\r\nthe Raider to lie. The explanation, translated, seemed to excite the\r\nchief, who turned to his young compatriot and entered into an animated\r\ndiscussion with him.\r\n\r\nWhile they were still talking, the gate in the wall was once more thrown\r\nopen, and to the white men's utter amazement, Grinson marched in at the\r\nhead of a procession of his captors.  His arms were unbound, his face\r\nwas wreathed in smiles, his body was bare to the waist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRINSON MARCHED IN AT THE HEAD OF A PROCESSION.]\r\n\r\n'Ahoy, messmates!' he cried at the top of his voice, rather hoarsely.\r\n'Beg pardon, young gents, but I mean to say--oh, cripes! Ephraim, me\r\nlad, I never thought I 'd see you again, 'cept as a ghost.  Am I drunk?\r\nNo, but I 'm darned merry, which I mean to say--I say, old cock,'\r\nturning to a Papuan, 'get me a drink--get us all a drink, and we 'll\r\ndrink your health and say no more about it.' He raised his arm, and\r\nkissed a spot just below his shoulder.  'Kiss it too, ugly mug! Come on,\r\nall you lubbers, kiss it, or I 'll never love you no more!'\r\n\r\nAnd to his friends' amazement the Papuans came to him one by one, and\r\nreverently kissed the spot, Grinson beaming on them.\r\n\r\n'That's right!  It tickles, and I don't like your ugly nose bones, but\r\nyou 've good 'earts. No, you don't--once is enough,' he cried to a man\r\nwho offered the salute a second time.\r\n\r\n'\"When I was young and had no sense!\"--no, blamed if it wasn't the most\r\nsensiblest thing ever I did, and that's saying something.'  He had now\r\ncome up to his amazed companions.  'There it is--that's what done it.\r\n\"A sweet little cherub what sits up aloft,\"--beg pardon, sir, I feels\r\nlike singing all the time.  That's what done it!'  He displayed his arm,\r\non which was the blue tattooed effigy of a bird of paradise.  'They\r\npeeled off my shirt, and there was I looking for 'em to plunge the knife\r\ninto my bare bussum, when dash me if they didn't start back with horror\r\nlike as if I 'd the smallpox--and me vaccinated, too, twice, on this\r\nvery arm.  'Twas the bird what done it, like the strawberry mark what\r\nproved to the Marchioness of Mayfair that the dustman was her long-lost\r\nson and heir, stole from his cradle by the lady's maid she 'd sacked for\r\nswilling of her eau de colony.  The ugly mugs take me for a long-lost\r\nbrother, and dash me if I ain't the best-looking of the family, Ephraim,\r\nme lad.'\r\n\r\nWhile the hilarious mariner was reeling off his yarn, the Papuans had\r\nexplained to the chief that, having discovered on his arm the image of\r\nthe totem of their tribe, they had brought him back, to exchange him for\r\none of the other prisoners, unless they too should prove to be\r\nsacrosanct.  To their intense discontent, the chief had refused to allow\r\nthem even to examine the arms of the three men; and while Trentham and\r\nhis companions were still digesting the astounding story told by\r\nGrinson, the crestfallen savages stole out of the gate in sullen\r\nill-humour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                             REMINISCENCES\r\n\r\n\r\n'A most fortunate coincidence, Grinson, that you happened to be tattooed\r\nwith the totem mark of these strange people,' said Trentham.  'But for\r\nthat we might all have gone into the pot in turn.'\r\n\r\nThe four men were seated in a hut placed at their disposal by the chief,\r\nappeasing their famishment with a variety of more or less unfamiliar\r\nfoods.\r\n\r\n'Ay, ay, sir!' returned the boatswain; 'though I never heard it called a\r\ntotem mark afore.  True, my head was spinning like a teetotum when 'twas\r\ndone, and if I 'd been a teetotaller--upon my word, sir, 'tis the\r\nremarkablest thing I ever heard on.  Ephraim, me lad, you can bear me\r\nout: wasn't that the only time you ever saw me squiffed?'\r\n\r\n'Which time was that, Mr. Grinson?' asked Meek.\r\n\r\n'Why, the time I had this 'ere teetotum mark pricked into my biceps.'\r\n\r\n'I 'm bound to say as how that was one of the times you was a trifle\r\novercome, though nothing to what you might have been.'\r\n\r\n'True, if I 'd been overripe they couldn't 'a done it, nor if I 'd had\r\nnothing at all, which it shows the good o' moderation, gentlemen. I was\r\njust comfortable; you know--when you 're pleased with everything and\r\neverybody.  'Twas like this.  I was never like most sailormen, as gets\r\ntattooed their first voyage, and ever after has the sins o' their youth\r\nstaring 'em in the face--like Ephraim, poor lad.'\r\n\r\nMeek looked guiltily at his long bony wrists and tried to draw his\r\nsleeves down over the blue anchors tattooed on them.\r\n\r\n'No,' Grinson went on, 'I was never a man for show.  Well, some\r\nmessmates of mine didn't understand my modest spirit, and laid their\r\nheads together for to give me the hall-mark as proves a seaman sterling,\r\nyou may say.  Ben Trouncer was at the bottom of it: the slyest sea-dog\r\nof a fellow you ever set eyes on.  He come to me one night when I\r\nhappened to be alone, all but Ephraim, in the bar-parlour of the \"Jolly\r\nSailors,\" and says, \"Going to the meeting on Wednesday, Josy?\" says he.\r\n\"What meeting?\" says I.  \"You don't mean to tell me you don't know!\"\r\nsays he.  \"I 'd never have believed it.  All the others are going;\r\nmeeting to form a sailors' goose club,\" says he. \"Fust I heard of it,\"\r\nsays I.  \"What's a goose club?\"  \"Why,\" says he, \"you pay so much a\r\nweek, and at Christmas every sailor-man gets a goose, wherever he\r\nis--Melbourne, Shanghai, Buenos Ayres, anywhere you like.  Fancy you not\r\nknowing of it!  Why, they all expect you to be made treasurer of the\r\nclub.  Let's have another pot, and I 'll tell you all I knows.\"\r\n\r\n'Well, Ben went on talking like a gramophone as won't run down--about\r\nsubscriptions and foreign agents, and what a heap of money there 'd be\r\nto take charge of, and he hoped I 'd be made treasurer, because some of\r\n'em wanted a scag called Joe Pettigrew, a fellow you wouldn't trust with\r\nthe price of a pot of four-half, which I agreed with, and said if Joe\r\nwas made treasurer he 'd get no subscriptions out of me.  \"Well,\" says\r\nBen, \"Joe 's the only man I 'm afraid of, and I 'll tell you why.  Them\r\nas wants him are going to propose that no one as ain't tattooed is to be\r\nedible for membership--see?  Just to keep you out, 'cos they know there\r\nain't a speck of blue about you.\"  \"Ho!\" says I. \"That 's their game.\r\nWell, they can make Joe treasurer, and he 'll pinch all your money, but\r\nnot mine, 'cos I can't join, not if I want to.\"\r\n\r\n'Well, he calls for another pot and goes on talking, and by long and\r\nshort he worked me up to believe as how the whole thing would bust up if\r\nI wasn't treasurer, and the picture he drored of the sailorman going\r\nwithout his Christmas goose was worse than onions for tickling your\r\neyeballs.  Then he told me how I 'd take the wind out o' Joe's sails if\r\nI had a nice fat goose tattooed on my shoulder out of sight, and spring\r\nit on 'em when they was cocksure I wasn't edible for membership. Having\r\nhad three or four pots, the notion tickled my fancy, and I had it done\r\nby a Jap as was the cleverest hand at tattooing you ever set eyes on.\r\nBen had left him in the bar till he talked me over.\r\n\r\n'Well, I went to the meeting, and Joe and his mates sniggered when they\r\nsaw me.  Ben proposed the club; carried unanimous.  Some one else\r\nproposed about the tattooing; carried unanimous.  Then Ben proposed me\r\nfor treasurer.  Up jumps one of Joe's friends and said I couldn't be\r\ntreasurer, 'cos I couldn't even be a member, not being tattooed. \"Ho!\"\r\nsays I, \"who says I ain't tattooed?\"  They laughed.  \"Who don't know\r\nthat?\" says they.  \"Ho!\" says I, \"you knows a lot,\" and I stripped and\r\nshowed 'em the finest goose as ever hung in Leadenhall Market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'WHO SAYS I AIN'T TATTOOED?']\r\n\r\n'Well, after that they made me treasurer, unanimous, even Joe voting for\r\nme, which it surprised me at the time.  Then Ben said that, me being\r\ntreasurer, 'twas for me to propose what the subscription should be.\r\n\"Right,\" says I.  \"Then I propose three-pence a week.\"  I was fair\r\nflabbergasted when Ben got up and spun a long yarn which I couldn't make\r\nhead or tail on, and ended by proposing they didn't have no subscription\r\nat all.  Carried unanimous.  It was a plant, you see, gentlemen.  I was\r\nfair done.  There never was no goose club, and only one goose, and that\r\nwas me, my mother said when I told her all about it.'\r\n\r\n'And your goose is a bird of paradise,' said Trentham.\r\n\r\n'A bird of----  Ho, here 's ugly mug! What might he want now?'\r\n\r\nIn the open doorway stood the interpreter.\r\n\r\n'Chief he say white man fella come alonga him,' said the man, looking at\r\nTrentham.\r\n\r\n'A royal command,' remarked Trentham, rising.  'I 'll try to get him to\r\nprovide us with guides to Wilhelmshafen.'\r\n\r\nSome ten minutes after Trentham's departure the rest were startled by a\r\nlong-drawn howl, like the sound of hundreds of men hooting an unpopular\r\nspeaker.\r\n\r\n'Blue murder!' exclaimed Grinson, as he hurried with the others to the\r\ndoorway.  The noise came from beyond the stockade.  The gate was shut,\r\nand the natives within the enclosure were strolling about with no\r\nappearance of concern.  Trentham was not visible.\r\n\r\n'I 'm afeard they 've took Mr. Trentham instead,' said Meek\r\nlugubriously.\r\n\r\n'Nonsense!' cried Hoole.  'That wasn't a cry of delight.  But I 'll just\r\nrun across to the chief's house; Mr. Trentham is probably there.'\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the house he was stopped by two natives, armed with\r\nspears, who stood there on guard.\r\n\r\n'You there, Trentham?' he called into the interior.\r\n\r\n'Yes; I 'll be with you shortly,' came the answer.\r\n\r\nReassured, Hoole returned to the hut.\r\n\r\n'It's all right, Meek,' he said.  'Don't get the wind up.'\r\n\r\n'No, Ephraim, me lad,' said Grinson, 'don't strain at your anchor.  'Tis\r\nyour great fault.'\r\n\r\nIt was half an hour or so before Trentham rejoined them.\r\n\r\n'The strangest story I 've ever heard,' he said.  'It wasn't easy to\r\nmake out that fellow's pidgin English, but I 'll tell you what I\r\nunderstand of it.  Long ago, soon after the beginning of the world, a\r\nbig ship came ashore after a great storm.  (That's our wreck, of\r\ncourse.)  The ship's white chief, a great medicine-man, had come to\r\nassist the forefathers of this tribe, then at war with many powerful\r\nneighbours. By the power of his fire magic--blunderbusses, no\r\ndoubt--their enemies were defeated; but I suppose his ammunition gave\r\nout, for, as the chief put it, the fire magic was lost.\r\n\r\n'The ship's captain was evidently a Frenchman. Finding it impossible to\r\nleave the island, he and his crew settled down and took wives among the\r\ntribe, and became the ruling caste.  The present chief is probably the\r\ngreat-grandson of the Frenchman; he has no idea how old he is, or how\r\nmany generations come between him and his ancestor. From the portrait of\r\nLouis XVI. we saw in the cabin, it's pretty clear that this happened a\r\nhundred and twenty odd years ago.  In that time, of course, the French\r\nstock has degenerated; as you heard, they 've retained a word or two of\r\nthe French language, and they 've tried to keep themselves select by\r\nbanishing from their inner enclosure all who take after the aborigines\r\nin feature, retaining only those who have something of the European cast\r\nof face.  That, as I understood the story, has led to trouble.  It's a\r\ncase of plebs and patricians over again.  The patricians are gradually\r\nweakening, the plebs becoming stronger; and the chief seems to be\r\ndecidedly jumpy; his authority is waning. You heard that howl just now?'\r\n\r\n'We did,' replied Hoole.  'Meek made sure you 'd been thrown to the\r\ndogs.'\r\n\r\nTrentham smiled.\r\n\r\n'The fact is, the plebs were disappointed of their feast.  They are\r\ncannibals; the patricians are not.  A big fellow came up as spokesman of\r\nthe plebs, and declared they must have one of us four.  Grinson is\r\nprotected by his goose, and the chief wouldn't give them you, Hoole, or\r\nme, because we know French.  But he suggested that we might dispense\r\nwith Meek.'\r\n\r\n'Me, sir!' cried Meek.\r\n\r\n'Yes.  I gathered that the chief was anxious to conciliate his rather\r\nunruly subjects, and I had a good deal of difficulty in begging you off,\r\npointing out (I hope you don't mind) that you are rather lean and\r\nscraggy----'\r\n\r\n'Danged if that ain't too bad!' cried Meek with unwonted vehemence.\r\n\r\n'Well, really, I thought it the best way to get you off.'\r\n\r\n''Tis not that I mind, sir--not at all, and I 'm obliged to you.  I was\r\nalways skin and bone, no matter what I eat----'\r\n\r\n'Like the lean cattle in the Bible, Ephraim,' said Grinson, 'what ate up\r\nthe fat uns and you 'd never have knowed it.'\r\n\r\n'True, so I was born,' Meek went on, 'and so I must be.  But the idea of\r\neating me, just because I never had no goose pricked on my arm nor can't\r\nparly-voo!  Danged if there 's any justice in this world--not a morsel.'\r\n\r\n'Well, you 're safe now, anyway,' said Hoole, smiling.  'Did you hear\r\nanything about Hahn, Trentham?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.  It appears that the numbers here have recently been increased by\r\nthe influx of people from one or two small coast villages that have been\r\ndestroyed by the Germans. This place, being farther from the sea, has\r\nescaped as yet; but the chief is rather alarmed, and has scouting\r\nparties constantly out to give warning if the white men from the ship\r\napproach.  Apparently Hahn fell into the hands of one of those parties.\r\nThe chief told me that a white man had been taken down to the shore to\r\nbe sacrificed in the hope of averting disaster.  The sacrificial party\r\nhas not returned yet, and I thought it wiser to say nothing about the\r\nrescue of the victim; it wouldn't tend to make us popular with the\r\nplebs.  The worst of it is, the chief seems to think we 'll be useful to\r\nhim.  When I talked about his helping us to get away he suddenly became\r\ndeaf, and I couldn't help judging from his manner that he wants to keep\r\nus, either to prop him up against his troublesome people, or to protect\r\nhim from the Germans. We had better humour him for the moment. At any\r\nrate we shall get food.  By and by we can take our bearings, possibly\r\nmake or get hold of a canoe.  It's no good our attempting to make our\r\nway overland to Wilhelmshafen through a country infested by cannibals.'\r\n\r\n'And precious little good our staying to help him against the Germans\r\nwith nothing but a revolver and our knives,' said Hoole. 'Still, there\r\n's nothing else for it.  If we can gain the people's confidence they may\r\nhelp us in the end--especially if the Raider clears off, and I guess it\r\nwon't remain in these waters for ever.  But it's deuced unpleasant.'\r\n\r\n'Ay, and there 's neither justice nor mercy in this world,' sighed Meek.\r\n'Eat me!  Br-r-r!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                            A RECONNAISSANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hut allotted to the four white men, like all the others in the inner\r\nenclosure, was built of logs, and in shape resembled an expanded\r\nsentry-box.  It had no furniture except a few grass mats laid upon the\r\nearthen floor, and a clumsy rack of sticks, containing some crude\r\nplatters of clay, and a couple of heavy wooden clubs.  Worn out by their\r\nrecent experiences, the occupants slept soundly through their first\r\nnight as the chief's guests, only disturbed at intervals by the\r\nvisitations of cockroaches which the darkness drew from crevices in the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nNext morning they were given a breakfast of bananas and nuts, and water\r\nbrought to them in long bamboo stalks, which had been cleaned of their\r\npartitions except at the end.\r\n\r\n'We are not supposed to wash,' remarked Trentham, 'and we can't shave;\r\nbefore long we shall all be as hairy as Meek.'\r\n\r\nMeek looked apologetic, and Grinson passed a hand over his cheeks and\r\nchin, already dark with stubble.\r\n\r\n'A regular Jack ashore, sir,' he said, 'and no barber round the corner.\r\nWhat is to be will be, and I only hope I make a better show than\r\nEphraim; his whiskers ain't much of an ornament, I must say.'\r\n\r\n'I ought to have shaved young,' sighed Meek.  ''Tis too late now, Mr.\r\nGrinson.'\r\n\r\n'Truly, Ephraim, you 've lost your chance, poor lad.  But you might look\r\nworse, that's one comfort.'\r\n\r\nWhile they were at breakfast the man who had interpreted on the previous\r\nday came with a message from the chief.  They were free to move about\r\nthe enclosure, but the gate was forbidden them.\r\n\r\n'We 're prisoners, then,' said Hoole.\r\n\r\n'I fancy he doesn't trust the cannibals outside,' said Trentham.  'For\r\nthe present I dare say we are safer where we are.  But I don't know how\r\nwe are to kill time.'\r\n\r\n'Here you are, sir,' said Grinson, producing a greasy pack of cards.  'A\r\nrubber or two 'll be good for the digestion.  Ephraim plays a good hand,\r\nthough you might not think it.'\r\n\r\nWhile they were playing cards a man came from the chief's house and\r\nlooked in on them through the doorway.  His shadow caused them to glance\r\nup, and Hoole and Trentham recognised him as the patrician leader of the\r\nparty from whom they had rescued Hahn. They wondered whether the\r\nrecognition was mutual, feeling that it might go hardly with them if\r\nthey were known; but the man, after a prolonged stare of curiosity,\r\ndeparted without giving any sign of suspicion.  It came out afterwards\r\nthat his party, finding the chimney blocked, had had to wait for the ebb\r\ntide and then walk for some miles along the shore before they reached a\r\npracticable path up the cliffs.  They had then returned to the chimney,\r\nremoved the obstruction from its top, and sought to track the fugitives;\r\nbut they had lost the trail in the forest.\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed--days of tedium and growing irritation.  The\r\nprisoners were given regular meals of bananas, sweet potatoes, and other\r\nroots, sometimes a bird or a pig; but movement beyond the stockade was\r\nstill interdicted.  They saw nothing of the chief, and one day, when\r\nTrentham sent him a message, asking that they might be allowed to go out\r\nand see what the Germans were doing, the answer was that he was sick,\r\nand could not attend to them until he was out and about again.  Hoole\r\nsuggested that it was a diplomatic illness, but the sight of the\r\nhideously painted figure of the tribal medicine-man going every day into\r\nthe chief's house seemed to show that the reason given was genuine.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon there were signs of much excitement in the village.  From\r\nbeyond the stockade came a babel of voices; a man admitted through the\r\ngate gave those within some news which appeared to agitate them, and a\r\nfew minutes after he had entered the chief's house the interpreter came\r\nrunning to the hut, and said that the chief wished to see the 'white man\r\nfella' at once.\r\n\r\n'Release at last!' said Trentham when he returned.  Alone of the four,\r\nMeek showed no sign of pleasure.\r\n\r\n'The old fellow is in a pretty bad way,' Trentham went on.  'The\r\nmedicine-man was chanting incantations over him, and he looked\r\npathetically resigned.  He had just heard bad news.  It appears that his\r\nson, whose name I understood to be Flanso--a corruption of Francois, I\r\nfancy--went out yesterday with a small scouting party, and had just got\r\nthrough that burnt village when they were surprised by a number of white\r\nmen and collared; only the messenger escaped.  Among the party was\r\nKafulu, the head-man of the natives outside, and it's to that fact we\r\nowe our chance.  I offered to go out and see if I could discover what\r\nhad become of the prisoners, anticipating the chief's request. He jumped\r\nat it, and told me that the cannibals outside, when they understand what\r\nour errand is, won't do us any harm. But only you and I are to go,\r\nHoole; the others must remain as hostages.'\r\n\r\n'A dirty trick, sir,' said Meek.  'As sure as your back is turned, they\r\n'll eat me; I know they will.'\r\n\r\n'Don't you take on, Ephraim,' said Grinson. ''Tis true I 'd rather go\r\nwith the gentlemen, but I 'll protect you, me lad. Before they eat you,\r\nthey 'll have to cook my goose.'\r\n\r\nEarly next morning, Hoole and Trentham started with half a dozen of the\r\nchief's best men and the interpreter.  Hoole had his revolver, Trentham\r\na spear like those with which the escort were armed.  They marched\r\nrapidly through the forest, reached the burnt village about midday, and\r\nfound there the bodies of two of the scouting party, shot by the\r\nGermans.  From this point they moved with great circumspection, the\r\nguide leading them through a maze of vegetation by a winding track that\r\nbore downhill, crossing narrow gullies and swift hill streams.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon they entered a tract of country strewn with\r\nrounded boulders, which had no doubt been brought down in remote ages by\r\nglacial action from the mountain range in the interior.  Here the ground\r\nsloped steeply to the edge of the cliffs, and they had a view far over\r\nthe sea.  Deprived of cover by the lack of vegetation, they bore away\r\ntowards the forest on the right.  Though they had approached by a\r\ndifferent route, the white men now recognised the spot from which they\r\nhad caught sight of the Raider lying in the cove below the cliffs.\r\nHalf-way down the forest-clad slope Trentham called a halt.\r\n\r\n'We know where we are now, Hoole,' he said, 'and I think we had better\r\nleave the natives here under cover while we go on by ourselves.  They\r\n'll be no good to us in reconnoitring, and the fewer the better on a job\r\nlike this.'\r\n\r\nHe instructed the interpreter to remain with the men on guard, and if\r\nnot rejoined by nightfall, to return to the village.\r\n\r\nA very rough and narrow track led through the trees and scrub with which\r\nthe whole face of the cliff was covered.  The two men crept cautiously\r\ndown this for some distance; then it occurred to Hoole that it would be\r\nsafer to make a way of their own through the bush, for at some turn of\r\nthe track they might suddenly meet some one ascending, or emerge\r\nunexpectedly into view from the beach. Accordingly they turned off to\r\nthe right, and continued their course as quickly as possible under\r\ncover, moving parallel with the track.\r\n\r\nNot many minutes had passed before they had reason to be glad that the\r\nprecaution had occurred to Hoole in time.  Less than a hundred yards\r\nbelow the spot where they had quitted the track they came to the edge of\r\na space from which the vegetation had been cleared away.  The path ran\r\nthrough this, and at one side of it stood a rough log hut where a German\r\nsailor, armed with a rifle, was standing on guard.  Trentham, a little\r\nin advance of Hoole, was the first to catch sight of the man.  He\r\nmotioned to Hoole to halt, peered out for a few moments at the scene\r\nbefore him, then went back.\r\n\r\n'There 's a sentry-post below,' he said in a low tone.  'The man's back\r\nwas towards me; he was watching something going on below him.  We shall\r\nhave to creep round.  It's pretty rough going; take care you don't\r\nslip.'\r\n\r\nKeeping on the seaward side of the sentry, they wormed their way through\r\nthe bush. With every step the descent became steeper, and they had to\r\ncling to branches and roots in order to keep their footing.  The contour\r\nof the cliff hid them from the sentry, but the dislodging of a loose\r\nstone might at any moment betray their presence, and they let themselves\r\ndown inch by inch with great care.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WITH EVERY STEP THE DESCENT BECAME STEEPER.]\r\n\r\nAs they had noticed on the occasion of their previous visit, the cove in\r\nwhich the Raider lay was almost encircled.  The cliff which they were\r\nnow scaling jutted out in a kind of spit on the eastern side.  When they\r\nfinally reached its base they found themselves among a tangle of jagged\r\nrocks.  The tide was coming in, and they realised from the banks of\r\nseaweed that the rocks were covered at the flood, and that they had\r\nlittle time to spare if their reconnaissance was to lead them much\r\nfarther and they had to return by the same route.\r\n\r\nAfter a precautionary glance seaward they began to make their way\r\nthrough the mass of rocks, clambering, springing from one to another,\r\nalways careful not to expose themselves to the view of the sentry\r\nsomewhere high up on their left.  Presently, between two high rocks at\r\nthe outer edge, they caught sight of blue water.  Entering the gap, they\r\nlooked out, and found that almost the whole of the cove was before them.\r\n\r\n'She 's gone,' said Hoole.\r\n\r\nThe well-remembered vessel was no longer at her anchorage.  No craft of\r\nany kind lay within the cove.  But men were moving about the beach.  To\r\nthe left, near the base of the cliff, above high-water mark, were two\r\nlarge sheds; a little further on was a third shed, still larger.\r\nBetween them the beach was covered with much miscellaneous litter, the\r\nnature of which the observers could not at present determine.  What\r\ninterested them most, and for a time puzzled them, was the sight of many\r\ndark figures working on a natural ledge some eighty feet above the sea\r\nlevel on the opposite side of the cove.  They heard the sound of picks,\r\nand saw black men bringing baskets from a narrow tunnel in the cliff\r\nface, and emptying them on to the beach below.  From the spot where the\r\ncontents fell clouds of black dust rose high into the air.  A white man\r\nwas walking up and down the ledge, occasionally moving his right arm in\r\na curiously jerky manner; and amid the other sounds came now and then\r\nrough shouts and sharp cracks.\r\n\r\n'By George, Hoole!' exclaimed Trentham under his breath, 'that\r\nparticular mystery is solved.  They are working coal!  There must be an\r\noutcrop in the cliff; of course they are not mining.  The Raider can't\r\nrely on filling her bunkers from captures, apparently, or they wouldn't\r\ngo to all this trouble.'\r\n\r\n'I guess it's the niggers get the trouble,' remarked Hoole.  'That\r\nfellow--in the distance he 's mighty like Halm--is making good play with\r\nhis whip.  You may bet your bottom dollar they snapped up Flanso and the\r\nrest to increase the number of their hands. Say, d' you hear that purr?'\r\n\r\nHe swung round and looked seaward, shading his eyes with his hands.\r\n\r\n'There she is,' he exclaimed a few moments later.  'Skip behind the\r\nrock, Trentham; she 's diving right here.'\r\n\r\n'The seaplane?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.  Can't you see her?  She 's cut off her engines, making a very\r\npretty swoop. See her now?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; you 've better eyes than mine, Hoole.'\r\n\r\nHoole smiled.  His eyes were fixed on the machine with an intense\r\nadmiring interest.\r\n\r\n'She blips,' he said, as the engine spluttered for a second or two.\r\n'Now she 's cut off again.  The pilot knows his job.  I wonder where she\r\n'll come down.'\r\n\r\nCrouching behind the rocks they watched the seaplane as it made a\r\ncircling movement, diving all the time, until it swept round and headed\r\nstraight for the entrance to the cove. From a height of about two\r\nhundred feet it swooped down towards the sea, 'blipped' again, then\r\ndescended lightly upon the surface, ran a few yards, and at last came to\r\nrest a little distance from the beach.  Several bare-legged German\r\nsailors had already emerged from one of the nearer sheds.  They waded\r\ninto the water.  Two of them carried the occupants of the seaplane on\r\ntheir backs to the shore, then returned to help their comrades to pull\r\nthe machine in.  It glided smoothly up the beach until it rested just\r\nbelow the sheds.\r\n\r\n'Gliders all complete,' said Hoole.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'They 've laid down boards on the beach; you can't see them from here.\r\nThey are well greased, too, to judge by the speed the floats slid up\r\nthem.  Those Germans are pretty thorough, Trentham.'\r\n\r\n'Where did you pick up all these details?' asked Trentham curiously.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I 've seen that sort of thing once or twice before.  But hadn't we\r\nbetter get back? There 's nothing more to be seen from this quarter, and\r\nI presume Flanso and his men are on that ledge yonder, or near about.'\r\n\r\n'That farthest shed is the officers' quarters, by the look of it.  The\r\ntwo airmen have just gone inside.  We 've learnt the lie of the land and\r\nnot much else, I 'm afraid.  Can't we go a little farther along the\r\nshore, behind the rocks, and climb the cliff nearer the sheds?'\r\n\r\n'We can try, but 'ware the sentry.'\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far, however, before the incoming tide forced them to\r\nleave the rocks and clamber up through the bushes.  The ascent was even\r\nmore difficult than the descent had been, and a miscalculation of the\r\ndirection of the path on which this sentry-box stood almost led to their\r\nundoing.  They had supposed that it ran fairly straight to the sheds\r\nfrom the point at which they had left it; but the nature of the ground\r\nhad necessitated its being carried a good many yards farther along the\r\ncliff, and then it bent round and formed a loop, approaching the sheds\r\nin the same direction as Hoole and Trentham were now going.  Unaware of\r\nthis, they were slowly climbing when Trentham slipped, displacing a mass\r\nof loose earth which went rattling down the cliff.  They were not\r\ngreatly alarmed, thinking that the sentry was too far away to have heard\r\nthe sound through the noise of the coal-tipping across the cove.  But\r\nfootsteps not far above them caused them to snuggle behind a thick bush.\r\nThe rustle of movement above drew nearer.  Through the bush they saw the\r\nsentry stepping cautiously down, and prodding the vegetation with his\r\nbayonet.  Hoole fingered his revolver, but Trentham signed to him that\r\nif any weapon had to be used it must be the spear.  The sentry, however,\r\nstopped ten or a dozen yards above them, then, apparently satisfied that\r\nthe landslide was accidental, laboriously climbed up the cliff.\r\n\r\nMuch relieved, for violent measures would have been fatal to the success\r\nof their reconnaissance, the two men waited for a quarter of an hour or\r\nso, then struck up the cliff some distance to the left of the spot where\r\nthe sentry had appeared, and wormed their way to the path, far beyond\r\nhis box, by a wide circuit.  It was almost dark by the time they\r\nrejoined the natives.  They marched a few miles until night descended\r\nupon them; then they rested for a while, discussing the results of their\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\n'I 'm afraid the chief will be disappointed at our returning without his\r\nson,' said Trentham, 'but I hope he 'll see reason.  We couldn't\r\npossibly have rescued him.'\r\n\r\n'Clearly not,' said Hoole.  'There wasn't time to discover exactly where\r\nthe Germans keep their slaves.  I guess we 'll have to reconnoitre\r\nagain, from the other side, before we can see our way clear.  The\r\nabsence of the Raider would help us considerably, for there appeared to\r\nbe only about half a dozen Germans on the spot.  I wish I could have\r\nseen whether that fellow cracking the whip was Hahn.'\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\n'Well, we don't owe the skunk a great deal; besides, he 's got my\r\nwatch.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                             COMPLICATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n'Does my eye squint, Ephraim, me lad?' asked Grinson, looking up into\r\nthe face of his taller companion.\r\n\r\nMeek gazed so earnestly at his questioner that his eyes converged.\r\n\r\n'I don't see no sign of it, Mr. Grinson,' he said, 'and I wouldn't\r\nsuppose as how you 'd be visited with that affliction at your time of\r\nlife.'\r\n\r\n'That's what I thought.  Then why the mischief can't I hit that tree?'\r\n\r\nMeek looked sadly at the tree in question, as if mutely reproaching it\r\nfor declining to be hit.\r\n\r\n'Maybe there 's a bias in the spear, like in bowls,' he said.  'My spear\r\n's just the same, for dash me if I can hit the trunk neither.'\r\n\r\nThe two seamen, with half a dozen natives, were on outpost duty in a\r\nglade a few miles on the seaward side of the village.  Trentham had\r\nreported the result of his reconnaissance to the ailing chief, who\r\nrealised at once that an attempt to release his men by force from an\r\nenemy equipped with the fire magic that his ancestors had lost was bound\r\nto fail. When Trentham pointed out that the Germans would probably make\r\nfurther raids, to increase the number of their slaves, and suggested the\r\npropriety of establishing outpost stations where watch might be kept, he\r\nassented, and agreed that Grinson and Meek should take their turns with\r\nthe rest.  Each band of natives chosen for this duty was accompanied by\r\none who belonged to the chief's own caste, so that Meek's dread of being\r\neaten, though not wholly removed, was a good deal lessened.  The two men\r\nbeguiled the tedious hours by practising spear-throwing under the\r\ntuition of the natives, but after three days had gained little skill.\r\nGrinson was more vigorous than accurate in his casts, while Meek,\r\nhandling his spear as if it were a paper dart, could throw neither far\r\nnor straight; he was a model of patient ineptitude.\r\n\r\n'I tell you what it is, Ephraim,' said the boatswain, sitting on the\r\ngrass, 'spears ain't tools for Christians, and I 'd scorn to demean\r\nmyself to these poor heathens, what knows no better.  We 'll leave 'em\r\nto 'em, me lad. Not that they 'd be any good if the Germans come with\r\nguns.'\r\n\r\n'D' you think they will, Mr. Grinson?'\r\n\r\n''Course they will, if they come at all.  I don't know what the gents\r\nmean by sticking on here.  We can't do no good, and if they 'd listen to\r\nme we 'd slip off and chance our luck.'\r\n\r\n'Aye, my vittals don't agree wi' me.  I 'm falling away, Mr. Grinson.\r\nLook here.'\r\n\r\nMeek was drawing together the band of his trousers to show how much he\r\nhad fallen away, when Hoole came into the glade.\r\n\r\n'Grinson, come with me,' he said.  'I want you to relieve Mr. Trentham\r\nat a new post we 've fixed up about a mile away. Carry on till I come\r\nback, Meek; I 'll relieve you then for a spell.'\r\n\r\nMeek looked far from happy when left alone with the natives.  Having\r\nnothing else to do, he picked up his spear and resumed his feeble\r\npractice.  While he was so engaged, the natives, who had been seated,\r\nsolemnly watching him, suddenly sprang to their feet and gazed\r\nexpectantly towards the trees.  Meek had heard nothing, and as he ambled\r\nforward to retrieve his spear he was startled by the silent appearance\r\nof Kafulu, one of the men who had been captured.  Still more amazed was\r\nhe to see that the Papuan carried a rifle.\r\n\r\nThe natives greeted their comrade with cries of joy, and crowded about\r\nhim, plying him with questions.  In a few moments they fell silent, and\r\nlistened intently as Kafulu eagerly addressed them.  Meek, a little in\r\nthe background, watched his gestures, wondering what he was saying, and\r\nwhy he continually brandished the gun.  Presently Kafulu turned and\r\npointed in the direction from which he had come, and then Meek noticed\r\nthat his back was seamed with scarcely healed weals. His attention was\r\nimmediately diverted, for among the trees at which Kafulu was pointing\r\nhe caught sight of the faces of several white men, who appeared to be\r\nmaking signs of friendship.  Now thoroughly alarmed, he turned to flee;\r\nbut the Germans issued suddenly from the forest; one of them made a sign\r\nto Kafulu, who sprinted across the glade with some of his companions,\r\nsprang upon Meek from behind, and hauled him back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KAFULU SPRANG UPON MEEK FROM BEHIND.]\r\n\r\n'Mr. Grinson.  Ahoy, Mr. Grinson!' shouted Meek.\r\n\r\nHis last word was smothered by a big hand laid across his mouth, and his\r\neyes widened with amazement when he looked into the face of his captor.\r\nThere were six Germans, armed with rifles.  Forming a guard round the\r\nnatives, they hurried them into the forest, with Meek helpless in their\r\nmidst.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour later Hoole and Trentham returned to the spot.\r\n\r\n'Hullo!  There's no one here,' said Trentham. 'Meek understood that he\r\nwas to wait here until relieved?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.  He looked a trifle uneasy, but he wouldn't desert his post.\r\nSurely----'\r\n\r\n'They couldn't resist the temptation, you mean?  I hope it's not so bad\r\nas that.  Let us see if we can trace the way he 's gone. Here 's his\r\nspear on the ground.'\r\n\r\n'And here are his footprints.  By gum, Trentham, look here: a good many\r\nEuropean boots have been treading the grass.  They came from the forest,\r\nand went back again. Germans, sure!'\r\n\r\n'It looks like it.  But it's unaccountable. The natives are too\r\nsharp-eared to have been taken by surprise.  They ought to have got Meek\r\naway in time.'\r\n\r\n'I 'll be shot if they haven't gone too! These are prints of bare feet,\r\naren't they?'\r\n\r\n'There 's no doubt about that.  They _must_ have been surprised and\r\ncollared, without a shot fired.  This is pretty bad, Hoole.'\r\n\r\n'I guess they wanted more miners. Wonder they haven't raided the village\r\nlong before this.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose they didn't think it worth while to come so far from the cove\r\nand make an organised raid.  Bows and spears wouldn't be much use\r\nagainst firearms, of course; but the Germans might have lost a few men\r\nin a regular attack, and they preferred to snap up small parties here\r\nand there.'\r\n\r\n'Any good going after them?'\r\n\r\n'Not an atom.  You may be sure they 're armed, and we have--one\r\nrevolver.  Things are in a deuce of a mess, Hoole.  If the natives are\r\nsuch poor scouts we stand to lose more of these outposts.  We shall have\r\nto drop the scheme.  And the immediate thing now is to go and bring\r\nGrinson back; he 'll be mad at losing Meek.  We had better talk things\r\nover with him, and see if anything can be done; for the life of me I\r\ncan't think what.'\r\n\r\nTrentham's contempt of the Papuans' scouting ability was not justified,\r\nas he would have known could he have heard and understood what Kafulu\r\nhad said to his comrades. He had told them that the white men had the\r\nfire magic of which they had heard.  It was hidden in the stick he\r\nshowed them.  If they would work for the white men, they too would be\r\ngiven sticks like the one he carried, and then they would be the lords\r\nof the village. Kafulu was Hahn's dupe and decoy.\r\n\r\nWhen Grinson heard that his companion of twenty-five years had been\r\ncaptured, his eyes became moist, and at first he seemed incapable of\r\nspeech.  Then his lips were pressed together rigidly; he flung away his\r\nspear, snatched out his knife, and cried:\r\n\r\n'Which way, sir?  Let me get at 'em.'\r\n\r\n'You 'd do no good, Grinson,' said Trentham. 'They 'd shoot you down.'\r\n\r\n'But 'tis Ephraim, sir--the lad as has been wi' me all over the seven\r\nseas.  I can't fool about and do nothing when my mate is digging coal\r\nfor those blackguard Germans. I put it to you, young gentlemen----'\r\n\r\n'Yes, we understand; but you must see that we three are not in a\r\nposition to attack goodness knows how many men armed with rifles.  We\r\nshould only be killed or collared too.  The sole chance of rescuing\r\nMeek----'\r\n\r\n'Say the word, sir,' said Grinson as Trentham paused.\r\n\r\n'Well, I confess I see no chance at the present moment; but at any rate\r\nit will be hopeless if we get into the Germans' clutches ourselves.\r\nSome plan may occur to us. Meanwhile let us get back.  I 'm afraid the\r\nchief will be cut up at the loss of more of his men.'\r\n\r\nWith the natives of the outposts they set off towards the village.  Long\r\nbefore they reached it there came through the forest a long-drawn\r\nmournful howl, or rather a chorus of howls, like the cries of hundreds\r\nof dumb animals in pain.  Ejaculations broke from the lips of the\r\nnatives.  They looked at one another with expressions of dismay, then\r\nset off at a trot, howling as they went.\r\n\r\n'They 've already got wind of it at the village,' said Hoole.  'Perhaps\r\none or two fellows escaped.'\r\n\r\n''Tis worse than that, sir,' said Grinson. 'It means death.  I heard the\r\nniggers howl like that, the time I was at Moresby.  It fair chills your\r\nblood, though they 'll laugh like hyenas as soon as the funeral's over.'\r\n\r\nHurrying on, with the horrible sound growing ever louder, they arrived\r\nat the village, and found the whole population assembled in front of the\r\nstockade, rocking themselves to and fro, and howling incessantly.  Dark\r\nlooks greeted the white men as they passed through the midst of the\r\nthrong and entered at the open gate.  Within, all was silent.  No one\r\nwas to be seen except the medicine-man, who was just issuing from the\r\nchief's house.  He stalked slowly through the enclosure and out at the\r\ngate.  Then the people emerged from their huts, and a number of the\r\nelder men formed up in procession and marched slowly into the house.\r\nWhen they had disappeared, the interpreter came up to Trentham.\r\n\r\n'Chief fella, he gone dead,' he murmured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                          THE CAST OF THE DIE\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hour after the white men's return, they watched from their hut the\r\nfuneral procession winding towards the gate.  Some of the younger men\r\nled the way; then followed four bearers, with the body of the dead chief\r\nencased in his sleeping-mat.  Behind marched his relatives and the whole\r\nof the population of the enclosure, the men wearing towering\r\nhead-dresses of feathers, the women carrying small branches.\r\n\r\n'Shall we follow?' asked Hoole.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps the people would like it,' replied Trentham.\r\n\r\nBut when they reached the gate at the tail of the procession they were\r\nstopped by the interpreter.\r\n\r\n'New chief he say no come alonga,' said he. 'Me fella people say old\r\nchief he die alonga you; all proper mad.'\r\n\r\n'That accounts for their scowls as we came in,' remarked Trentham.  'I\r\nsuppose the medicine-man accuses us of giving the evil eye.  But the new\r\nchief, whoever he is, evidently doesn't want us to be pulled to pieces.'\r\n\r\n'Things are going from bad to worse,' said Hoole.  'Our news won't make\r\nthem better pleased with us.  I guess there 'll be trouble.'\r\n\r\nThe death of the chief and the absence of his son had in fact kindled a\r\nslumbering spark of revolt in the Papuan community.  A chief in New\r\nGuinea at no time wields great authority over his tribe, and the\r\nprestige of the dominant caste had already fallen low. Authority was\r\nassumed by a cousin of the dead man, but he had no moral qualities to\r\nsupport it.  After the funeral, when Trentham reported to him, through\r\nthe interpreter, the capture of the outpost, his agitation bordered on\r\nhysteria.  The Papuans already connected their recent misfortunes with\r\nthe arrival of the white men, who, they declared, were in league with\r\nthe white men from the ship, and were responsible for the capture of\r\ntheir leader Kafulu and the late chief's son. The disappearance of the\r\noutpost would confirm their dark suspicions, and the fact that Meek also\r\nhad gone would seem to them proof of collusion.\r\n\r\nTrentham offered to relieve the chief of anxiety by quitting the place\r\nwith his companions, but this suggestion only increased his distress,\r\nand it dawned upon Trentham that he was inclined to cling to the white\r\nmen as upholders of his feebleness.  How feeble he was became apparent\r\nbefore Trentham left the house.  A number of the Papuans came to the\r\nouter gate and demanded an interview with their new chief.  On being\r\nadmitted, their spokesman recounted the disasters that had befallen the\r\ntribe since the strangers came, and insisted on the two younger men\r\nbeing given to them for a cannibal feast. Was it not the custom, they\r\nasked, within the memory of the elder men, for a sacrifice to be made on\r\nthe death of a chief?  The victims were at hand.  As for the fat man who\r\nbore the totem mark on his shoulder, they must spare him, but being a\r\nwhite man he must be sent away; let him go into the forest.\r\n\r\nThe chief was on the point of yielding, in the hope of gaining\r\npopularity with his unruly subjects, when one of the elder patricians\r\ninterposed.  The late chief had spared the white men, he said; they were\r\nfriends of Flanso, who would rightfully have succeeded his father; and\r\nif Flanso returned he would certainly vent his wrath on any one who did\r\nthem harm.  This firm stand on the part of a man of weight caused the\r\nunstable chief to veer. With an effort to assume a firm and dignified\r\nattitude he dismissed the deputation, who retired in undisguised\r\ndissatisfaction and anger.\r\n\r\nIt was only after they had departed that Trentham learnt from the\r\ninterpreter what their object had been, and how their request had been\r\nreceived.  Watching the scene intently, he had noted the indecision of\r\nthe chief and the mischief that blazed in the eyes of the Papuans.\r\n\r\n'I 'm afraid there 's trouble brewing,' he said on returning to his hut.\r\n'The new chief's a man of straw; he 'll give way to the cannibals one of\r\nthese times, and then----'\r\n\r\n'I guess we won't wait for that,' said Hoole.  'We should be no worse\r\noff in the forest, and I vote we clear out one dark night and take our\r\nchance.'\r\n\r\n'What about Ephraim, sir?' asked Grinson.  'I say nothing about you two\r\ngentlemen, but only speak for myself, and I swear I won't leave these\r\n'ere parts without Ephraim.'\r\n\r\n'Sure,' said Hoole.  'I 'm with you all the time.  But you 'll allow it\r\nrequires a little consideration, Grinson, and my proposition is that we\r\nall put on our thinking caps and see if we can hit on one of those\r\ncunning plots you read of in story-books.  I only wish I had a pipe.\r\nSmoke clears the air.'\r\n\r\nTrentham smiled; Grinson opened his tobacco-box.\r\n\r\n'Chewing won't do the trick, I suppose, sir,' he said.  'I 've enough\r\ntwist for two quids.'\r\n\r\n'No, no; I 've never chewed anything hotter than gum,' said Hoole.\r\n'Keep your baccy, man.  I say, it's time for our supper. They 're late\r\nthis evening.  Do they keep a fast after a funeral?'\r\n\r\n'I fancy I hear 'em coming now, sir. Maybe it's an extra spread.'\r\n\r\nBut the native brought only the food to which they were accustomed, and\r\nof which they were heartily tired.  It was dark by the time they had\r\nfinished their meal.  They had no light, but they squatted on their\r\nmats, chatting quietly until sleepiness should steal upon them.  The\r\nsounds from beyond the stockade died down as usual; it seemed, indeed,\r\nthat stillness had fallen upon the village earlier than on any previous\r\nnight.  Grinson was the first to close his eyes; the other two were\r\nstill talking in low tones when a sudden commotion from the direction of\r\nthe gate caused them to spring up and rush to the doorway, where Grinson\r\nimmediately joined them.  They could see nothing in the darkness, but\r\nthe cries of the two men who always stood on guard were drowned by a\r\nchorus of savage yells.  Men were heard rushing across the enclosure;\r\nthen came the whistling of spears and sharp cracks of clubs falling on\r\nsolid skulls.\r\n\r\n'The beggars outside are attacking the stockade,' said Trentham.\r\n\r\n''Tis rank mutiny and rebellion,' growled Grinson.  'Shall we lend a\r\nhand, sir?'\r\n\r\nHoole had whipped out his revolver.\r\n\r\n'Hold hard,' said Trentham; 'we may want that for a later occasion.  I\r\nthink we had better let them fight it out.  For one thing, we 're not\r\nused to their weapons; then, if we take sides, we 're hopelessly done\r\nwith the Papuans, and shouldn't dare to show our faces among them.'\r\n\r\n'But we 'll have to fight for our lives if they break in,' said Hoole.\r\n'We might get away now.'\r\n\r\n'I don't think they 'll break in.  The stockade 's very stout.  Don't\r\nyou think we might turn the crisis to account?'\r\n\r\n'How do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'Let us wait a little and see how the fight goes.  Whichever side wins,\r\nI think we may have a trump card.'\r\n\r\nThey stood listening to the din, which appeared to be concentrated in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the gate.  It lasted only a few minutes.  The\r\nsentries had detected the stealthy approach of the Papuans in the nick\r\nof time.  The stockade was manned before the attack gathered force; its\r\nstout timbers resisted all the onslaughts of the undisciplined savages,\r\nwho drew off, baffled, carrying away those who had been disabled by the\r\nweapons of the defenders.\r\n\r\n'Now 's the time for us to chip in,' said Trentham.  'It's clear that we\r\nare responsible, partly at any rate, for the situation. The Papuans\r\nsuspect us of complicity with the Germans; they are angry because they\r\ncan't feast on us; and they believe it's due to us that their friends\r\nhave been captured. The present chief is no good; he 'll either give way\r\nto them in the end, or will ultimately be beaten by sheer weight of\r\nnumbers. Nothing will restore the position but the return of the\r\nrightful chief--that young fellow Flanso.'\r\n\r\n'Who 's a prisoner,' remarked Hoole.\r\n\r\n'Exactly.  Well, we must rescue him and the other prisoners, including\r\nMeek.  By that means we shall please everybody.'\r\n\r\n'You 've got a plan?'\r\n\r\n'An idea came into my head suddenly just now when the fight was going\r\non.  With care and luck it may work.  If you like it, I 'll go and see\r\nthe chief, and we can start to-morrow.'\r\n\r\nDuring the next twenty minutes the three men were engaged in an earnest\r\ndiscussion. Then Trentham made his way to the chief's house, where most\r\nof the important men of the community were assembled.  Half an hour\r\nlater he returned to his friends.\r\n\r\n'It's all right,' he said.  'By Jove! talking pidgin is the most tiring\r\njob I know.  In the morning the chief will make an oration at the gate.\r\nHe 's not at all keen on his new job, and would like to see Flanso back.\r\nHe believes the rebels will be willing to give us a chance.  Then it's\r\nup to us.'\r\n\r\nThe chief turned out to be better as an orator than as a man of\r\naction--Cicero rather than Coriolanus, as Trentham suggested.  His\r\nspeech brought about an instant change of feeling in the Papuans.  If\r\nthe white men restored Kafulu and his comrades to them, they would let\r\nbygones be bygones.  If Flanso also was restored to his people, they\r\nwould dutifully accept his authority.\r\n\r\nTwo hours after sunrise the whole population, a silent throng, gathered\r\nat the sides of the track to watch the white men start on their\r\nenterprise.  Three stalwart natives accompanied them, each of whom\r\ncarried, wound about his body, a long coil of grass rope.  Grinson was\r\nhimself again.\r\n\r\n'Good-bye, old ugly mug,' he cried as he passed the man who had\r\ndiscovered his totem mark.  'Wait till the clouds roll by. Farewell,\r\nsweet maid'--to a hideous old woman; 'for they all love Jack, and you\r\n'll meet us coming back, and there 'll be dancing with the lasses on the\r\ngreen, oh!  It pleases 'em, sir,' he said, apologetically, to Trentham,\r\n'though they don't understand, poor heathens.  But I 've been told I 've\r\ngot a very good singing voice.'\r\n\r\n'Let's hope you won't sing another tune before the day 's over,' said\r\nTrentham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                       THE ORDEAL OF EPHRAIM MEEK\r\n\r\n\r\nMeek's mind worked slowly.  For some little time, as he marched\r\nshorewards among his fellow captives, he realised merely the fact that\r\nhe was a prisoner in the hands of the Germans.  He did not ask himself\r\nwhy he had been captured, or throw his imagination forward in an effort\r\nto forecast his fate. With his usual shambling gait he trudged on,\r\nglancing now at the Papuans, now at the Germans, and occasionally\r\nstroking his thin whiskers in the manner of one who finds the world a\r\ngreat puzzle.\r\n\r\nPresently illumination came to him.  Fixing his eyes on the stout figure\r\nof the man who led the party, he muttered 'Trousers!' and thought of Mr.\r\nGrinson.  Yes, to be sure, this was the extraordinary mariner who had\r\nswum ashore from a wreck without soiling his trousers, who had been\r\nsaved from the cannibals' cooking pot, and had mysteriously disappeared\r\nwhen leading his rescuers to Mushroom Hill.  His trousers were not so\r\nclean as they had been; there were black smudges on them.  What would\r\nMr. Grinson say to that?\r\n\r\nBefore Meek had got much further in his cogitations, he found himself\r\nfully occupied in keeping his footing on a rugged zigzag path that\r\nscored the surface of a steep downward slope.  Then, lifting his eyes,\r\nhe beheld the sea, and below, in a still cove, a vessel painted bright\r\nblue lying close inshore, and moored stem and stern.  In shape she\r\nresembled the raider which had sunk the _Berenisa_ a few weeks before,\r\nbut she had had a new coat of paint.  Meek saw at a glance that she had\r\nsteam up, and wondered whether she was short-handed and he had been\r\nimpressed to make up her complement.\r\n\r\nA turn in the path shut the vessel from his view, but opened up another\r\nscene.  On the left a number of natives were felling small trees, in\r\ncharge of a European who every now and then cracked a long whip.  'I\r\ndon't hold with nigger-driving!' thought Meek, shaking his head as he\r\npassed on.\r\n\r\nThe path becoming easier, he was now able to think of something more\r\nthan his feet. ''Tis the Raider,' he said to himself, 'though never did\r\nI see a ship of her tonnage painted sky blue afore.  Trousers is a\r\nGerman, without a doubt.  Now what 's he think he 's going to do with\r\nme?  I 'll not sign on with a German pirate--never!'\r\n\r\nAnother turn brought the cove again into view.  The seaplane had just\r\nrisen from the surface, and was now soaring towards the western horn.  A\r\nfew seconds afterwards Hahn and his party reached the sentry, who\r\nsaluted, looking curiously at Meek.  Hahn struck to the left, and\r\npresently, after another steep descent, came to the broad ledge on which\r\nnatives were moving up and down, carrying baskets out of a shallow\r\ntunnel. The full baskets were tipped over on to the beach, then taken\r\nback to the tunnel to be refilled.  In charge of the toilers was a\r\nsturdy German seaman, who had a rifle slung over his back and held in\r\nhis right hand a long, evil-looking whip.\r\n\r\nMeek's ideas were becoming clarified.  As a seaman he knew what a great\r\nexpenditure of coal was involved in keeping the Raider with steam up,\r\neven though the fires were banked. Clearly the Germans had been scouring\r\nthe neighbourhood for men to work the seam which they had discovered in\r\nthe cliff side. But he was still wondering what he had to do with all\r\nthis, when he received a rude shock.\r\n\r\n'Another batch for you, Hans,' said Hahn in German to the overseer.\r\n'There 's an Englishman among them as you see.  It's almost time to\r\nknock off now.  Put him in the compound with the rest; we 'll set him at\r\nwork to-morrow.'\r\n\r\nThe man grinned.  Herding the new batch of prisoners into an enclosure\r\nlike a sheep pen, adjacent to the mouth of the tunnel, he drew a hurdle\r\nacross the entrance, and returned to superintend the last operations of\r\nthe day. Hahn, meanwhile, had descended to the beach and entered the\r\nofficers' shed.\r\n\r\nMeek, of course, had not understood what Hahn had said.  Without\r\nsuspicion of the morrow's destiny, he found himself penned up with half\r\na dozen black men, and felt the indignity of his position.\r\n\r\n'Like sheep!' he muttered.  'Like sheep! What would Mr. Grinson say?'\r\n\r\nHe was no longer beset by fears of being eaten.  The natives squatted\r\napart, talking among themselves, and watching their comrades on the\r\nledge.  If Meek could have understood their speech, he would have known\r\nthat they were already suspicious of Kafulu, who had quitted them a\r\nlittle while before.  Was it for this that he had enticed them away--to\r\ncarry heavy baskets of black rock from a dark fearsome hole?  How long\r\nwould it be before they received the firesticks promised them?  Their\r\ncomrades looked unhappy.  How quiet they were! How they shrank away when\r\nthey passed the man with the whip!  Where was Flanso?\r\n\r\nPresently a whistle sounded below.  The men who had empty baskets set\r\nthem down against the wall of the ledge and stood in line. Those whose\r\nbaskets were full tipped their contents on to the beach, and joined\r\ntheir fellows.  From the mouth of the tunnel streamed the niggers,\r\nblinking as they came into the light.  Wearily they dragged themselves\r\nto their places in the line--silent, cowed, miserable.  Among them was\r\nFlanso, and at sight of him the six natives in the pen drew in their\r\nbreath.  His cheeks were hollowed; his skin was no longer a glistening\r\nbronze, but the dull black of coal dust.\r\n\r\nThe German counted the men as they formed up.  When he had counted\r\ntwenty-eight he cracked his whip, and the limp nerveless creatures\r\nturned to the right and marched into the pen, where they flung\r\nthemselves down in utter dejection.  They scarcely heeded the newcomers;\r\nonly Flanso started on seeing Meek, and turned upon him a look of\r\nagonised inquiry, of which the seaman was unconscious.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later four seamen came from below, each carrying two\r\npails.  They set these down within the pen, and at a signal from Hans\r\nthe natives approached one by one, and took their food in their hands.\r\nEach man had as much as his two hands would hold of a sort of thick\r\nporridge.  When Meek's turn came, he shook his head.\r\n\r\n'No, it ain't proper,' he said.  'Not for a white man.  I can't do it.'\r\n\r\nHans knew no English, but Meek's objection was obvious.  He laughed, and\r\nwhen the seamen returned with pails of water he said to them: 'The\r\nEnglish swine won't eat out of his hands.  Tell the quarter-master.'\r\n\r\nThey jeered at Meek, took up the empty pails and departed.  When they\r\ncame back for the water-pails, one of them carried a basin of porridge,\r\na spoon, and a mug of water, which he handed to Meek with an oath. While\r\nMeek ate his supper the Germans stood around him, uttering flouts and\r\njibes, which, being incomprehensible, did not spoil his appetite.  When\r\nhe had finished they left with the utensils, another man came to relieve\r\nHans for the night, and the prisoners were left in the pen until it was\r\nalmost dark. Then the sentry cracked his whip, the natives sprang to\r\ntheir feet and lined up, and Meek looked on in astonishment as they were\r\nmarched into the tunnel, the entrance to which, when all had gone in,\r\nwas closed by means of a stout wooden grating.  He was left alone in the\r\npen.\r\n\r\n'I don't rightly know if this is what they call slavery,' he murmured,\r\n'but it do seem so.  I don't hold with it.  What would Mr. Grinson say?'\r\n\r\nThe night was chilly, and Meek slept uneasily.  Once he was awakened by\r\na flash from a lantern, and saw another German staring at him curiously.\r\n\r\n'Aha, John Bull!' said the man with a grin.\r\n\r\nMeek turned over and went to sleep again.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, cramped and stiff, in the morning, the natives were\r\nfiling into the pen. Breakfast was a repetition of supper, and after the\r\nmeal Hans appeared, and drove the men back to their work.  Three of the\r\nnew prisoners were sent into the tunnel to dig, the other three were\r\nmade carriers.  Meek was again left alone.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o'clock Hahn came up, with two of his fellow officers, who\r\nstared at Meek, laughed, talked in their own language, and departed,\r\nleaving Hahn behind.\r\n\r\n'Your, name is Meek, I zink so?' said the German.\r\n\r\n'Ay, Ephraim Meek, that's my name.'\r\n\r\n'So!  Veil, Ephraim Meek, never I exbected to haf ze bleasure to see you\r\nagain. Ze ozers--vere are zey?'\r\n\r\nMeek looked at him for a few moments in silence.  The German was not\r\naware, then, that the other three had been with him in the native\r\nvillage.  Slow-witted though he was, Meek had an inspiration.  To tell\r\nthe truth might harm his friends.  He had a brief struggle with his\r\nconscience, decided for a compromise, and said:\r\n\r\n'I don't know.  They may be eat.'\r\n\r\n'So!' Hahn looked pleased.  'Zey vere fatter as you.  Ze niggers keep\r\nyou to fatten, eh?  Veil, Ephraim Meek, I save you, see? I bring you\r\nhere.  You are safe.  Of course, you must make yourself useful.  You\r\nshall eat, zerefore shall you vork.  You shall find a pick or a\r\nbasket--and zere is blenty of coal.'\r\n\r\nMeek stroked his whiskers, looked at the German, then shook his head.\r\n\r\n'No; I can't do it,' he said.  'Not coal.'  Hahn laughed.\r\n\r\n'You do look like a broken-kneed horse,' he said.  'Not equal to ze\r\nniggers; but you haf strength enough for zis job.'\r\n\r\n'Not coal,' Meek repeated, in his mournful tones.\r\n\r\n'Vy not coal?  You are afraid to soil ze hands?  Ach!  Is coal more\r\ndirty as ze tar of your ropes?  A seaman's hands!  Ha! ha! You are funny\r\nman, Meek!'\r\n\r\nHahn laughed heartily; it seemed to him a very good joke.  Meek,\r\nhowever, had thrust his hands into his pockets and set his lips\r\ndoggedly.\r\n\r\n'Come,' said Hahn impatiently.  'Zis is to vaste time.  You shall----'\r\n\r\n'True, it is waste time,' Meek interrupted. Speaking with a firmness\r\nwhich Grinson would hardly have recognised, he went on: 'I 'll dig no\r\ncoal for Germans, not I.  I 'll not soil my hands with it.  Not for\r\nGerman pirates.  Never in the world.'\r\n\r\nFor a few moments Hahn stared at the seaman as though he were a strange\r\nanimal, a curiosity in the natural world.  Then he guffawed scornfully.\r\n\r\n'So!' he ejaculated.  'You are a lord, eh? A prince, eh?  You vill not\r\nvork, eh?  And you exbect to haf good food for nozink, a broken-kneed\r\nswine of a sailor.  Hans,' he cried, speaking in German, 'take this\r\nhound of an Englishman and tie him to yonder stump, and leave him there\r\nuntil he comes to his senses.  He refuses to work.  Not a morsel of\r\nfood, not a drop of water.  See to that!'\r\n\r\nThe man grinned, laid aside his whip, came into the pen, and seized Meek\r\nby the arm. And then Meek belied his name.  His mild countenance was\r\ntransfigured.  Wrenching his arm from the German's grasp, he doubled his\r\nfist, and let out with a drive that sent the man staggering back against\r\nthe fence. Though his frame was slight, and his legs were neither\r\nshapely nor firm, he had not served a lifetime at sea without developing\r\na certain muscular force.  But his active resentment, natural as it was,\r\nwas nevertheless unwise.  The two Germans sprang on him together.  His\r\nstruggles were vain. Twisting his arms, his captors dragged him out of\r\nthe pen to the tree-stump which Hahn had indicated, and in a minute had\r\nlashed him firmly to it.  Hahn kicked him; the other picked up his whip\r\nand flicked the helpless prisoner, then rushed among the natives, who\r\nhad halted to watch the scene, and smote right and left among them.\r\nWith a parting jeer, Hahn descended the path to the beach, leaving Hans\r\nin charge.\r\n\r\nMeek's face was towards the sea, and he had a full view of the ledge and\r\nof the cove below.  The natives passed in and out of the tunnel,\r\nglistening with perspiration, urged to utmost exertion by fear of the\r\nmerciless whip. They tipped their baskets over the brink of the ledge,\r\ncoughing as clouds of black dust rose and enveloped them.  On the beach\r\nsome of the Raider's crew moved idly about. At the door of the shed Hahn\r\nstood talking to an officer, apparently the captain of the vessel; they\r\nboth glanced up at the ledge, laughed, and evidently found amusement in\r\ndiscussing the plight of their victim.  Meek noticed that there were no\r\nuniforms among the Germans, but a something indefinable in their air and\r\ngait bred the conviction that they were men of the navy.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Meek was suffering torture from the heat and his\r\nbonds.  He could not move either arms or legs; his throat was filled\r\nwith coal dust; he longed for water to moisten his parched lips.  Now\r\nand then the overseer passed him, grinning in his face, uttering words\r\nof mockery which affected Meek only by their tone.  To him it was so\r\nmuch ugly bad language.  He spoke no word, did not deign to beg for\r\nmercy, even though, as the hours passed, he felt that exhaustion and\r\npresently death itself must overtake him.  In this time of trial it\r\nappeared that a new spirit had assumed possession of him--or rather the\r\nold spirit of British seadogs, the spirit that would scorn to show sign\r\nof flinching.\r\n\r\nAbout midday Hahn came up to the ledge, and stood with arms akimbo,\r\ncontemplating his prisoner.\r\n\r\n'You see?' he said.  'You haf now enough?  You vill obey?'\r\n\r\nMeek gazed at him out of haggard eyes, but said never a word.\r\n\r\nHahn pointed to a man carrying a well-loaded tray into the officers'\r\nshed below.\r\n\r\n'Blenty of food.  Beer--English beer.  A pint of 'alf-an'-'alf, eh?\r\nZere is zome for you--ven you get coal.  I am not hard, no.  You say you\r\nvill dig, and I loose you--you shall haf a glass beer before you dig;\r\nzat is not hard?  You say yes?'\r\n\r\nMeek moved his tongue over his dry lips.\r\n\r\n'Not for German pirates!' he muttered huskily.\r\n\r\n'Pirates, you dog!' cried Hahn with a fierce scowl, and seemed to be\r\nabout to argue the point, but changed his mind.  Cursing Meek as an\r\nEnglish fool, he went away.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of the day Meek was partly shaded from the sun\r\nby the cliff towering behind him; but in the afternoon the rays beat\r\nupon his head, and his agony increased.  With all his strength of will\r\nhe resisted the faintness that threatened to overpower him.  He felt\r\nthat he must not give way before these black men, who passed up and down\r\nhour after hour until his bloodshot eyes were dazzled.\r\n\r\nThe time came for work to cease.  Again the natives were herded into the\r\npen, and the seamen brought them their food.  The Germans jeered at the\r\nhelpless prisoner as they passed him; one of them dangled a pail of\r\nwater under his eyes.  Then exhausted nature could endure no more.\r\nMeek's head lolled forward.  Hans rushed up, looked at him, and called\r\ndown to the beach that the Englishman had fainted.\r\n\r\n'Fling a pail of water over him!' shouted Hahn.  'I am coming.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GERMAN FLUNG A PAIL OF WATER OVER THE UNCONSCIOUS\r\nMEEK.]\r\n\r\nWhen Hahn appeared, Meek had revived.\r\n\r\n'You are a fool!' cried the German angrily.  He was feeling very sore.\r\nMeek had been the theme of discussion in the officers' mess, and Hahn\r\nhad had to endure a good deal of heavy raillery on his account. He was\r\ntold that he had been sent out to catch niggers; why had he burdened\r\nhimself with a pig of an Englishman?  Where had he found the man?  How\r\nhad a solitary Englishman, a seaman, come to be among natives in this\r\nremote part of the island? They supposed he had been shipwrecked; then\r\nwhy had Hahn not left the man to meet his fate among cannibals?  Hahn\r\nwas in a difficulty, because he had said nothing about the other white\r\nmen, told nothing about his rescue by them.  His escape from the\r\ncannibals, according to his story, had been due to his own ingenuity.\r\nHe could not satisfactorily account for Meek, and he wished that,\r\ninstead of bringing him as a prisoner, he had knocked him on the head or\r\nshot him at once.\r\n\r\nNow, however, he was actuated by another motive.  The Englishman, to his\r\nvast surprise, had defied him, and his fellow-officers had chaffed him\r\nabout it.  The Englishman's spirit must be broken.\r\n\r\n'You are a fool,' he repeated.  'You bring all zis on yourself..  You\r\nshall haf food to-night; I am not hard, but you shall be tied up still.\r\nIt is German discipline. To-morrow must you vork--understand?  You are\r\nbad example to ze ozers.  Zere is ze night for zinking.  You shall zink.\r\nIn ze morning you shall haf sense, and vork.'\r\n\r\n'Never!' cried Meek hoarsely.  'Not coal.  Not for German pirates!'\r\n\r\n'Pig!  I say you shall zink about it all night,' roared Hahn,\r\nexasperated.  'To-morrow you shall vork, or I vill shoot you dead.\r\nUnderstand?'\r\n\r\nMeek made no reply.  Hahn savagely bade Hans give him a little food and\r\norder the sentries to keep an eye on him during the night.  Then he\r\nreturned to the beach, and Meek was left to contemplate the prospect of\r\ntwelve hours' torture before a bullet put an end to it all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                               THE LEDGE\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout an hour before sunset, two men were warily feeling their way among\r\nthe boulders that strewed the steep declivity above the ledge.  Slowly\r\nthey moved downwards, rarely rising to their full height, but stooping\r\nas they dodged in and out between the largest of the stones, and heeding\r\ntheir feet with strained watchfulness.  They were Trentham and Hoole.\r\nGrinson, with the rest of their party, had been left in hiding near the\r\nburnt village, unwillingly; but Trentham had remarked that his bulky\r\nform was ill suited to reconnaissance work; a call would be made on his\r\nresources later.\r\n\r\nThe calm surface of the cove was spread out nearly two hundred feet\r\nbelow them.  They could see two of the sheds, a few men moving about,\r\nand the seaplane lying high up on the beach; but the Raider, moored near\r\nthe innermost shore, was at present invisible.  Nor could they see the\r\nledge, almost perpendicularly beneath them, but now and then they heard\r\nthe crack of the overseer's whip, and the crash of coals as they fell\r\nupon the beach. In front of them the air was slightly darkened by dust\r\nwafted up the face of the cliff.\r\n\r\nAs they climbed lower they moved still more slowly and cautiously, often\r\npausing to rest.  At one of these halts Trentham leant against a large\r\nboulder, and started back in haste as it moved, swaying slightly and\r\nnoiselessly like those rocking stones which are to be found here and\r\nthere on our coasts, and which, insecurely poised though they seem, are\r\nrarely moved from their seats.  The risk of disturbing the boulder and\r\nbetraying his presence brought a momentary pallor to his cheeks.  When\r\nthey moved on again, they tested every upstanding rock before putting\r\nany pressure upon it, and found more than one which very little force\r\nwould cause to fall.\r\n\r\nThe boulders gave effective cover from observation from the beach, and\r\nthe contour of the cliff hid them from the sentry on the cliff path\r\nseveral hundreds of yards away. But presently the descent became\r\nsteeper; they caught sight of the top of the Raider's wireless mast; the\r\nsounds from the ledge and the beach grew more distinct and the dust\r\ncloud denser.  They seemed to have come to the end of the scattered mass\r\nof boulders, and peering over, they saw a fairly smooth slope, too steep\r\nto climb, lacking in cover, and ending in a sharp edge between fifty and\r\nsixty feet below.  Any boulders that in times past may have rolled here\r\nhad found no lodgment, or, at any rate, must have long since fallen into\r\nthe cove.\r\n\r\nWhile they were crouching behind the lowest of the boulders, wondering\r\nhow they could determine the exact position of the prisoners, they heard\r\na shout from beyond the ledge, followed by an answering call, fainter,\r\nmore distant.  They shrank back, half fearing that they had been seen;\r\nbut the shouts were not repeated, and there was no sign of excitement\r\namong the men on the beach.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later, apparently from a spot immediately beneath them,\r\ncame the sound of a voice speaking in loud tones, yet not so clearly\r\nthat they could distinguish the words.  It broke off once or twice, and\r\nthey listened for an answering voice, but heard none.  Then one shouted\r\nword struck distinctly upon their ears.  'Pig!'  Stretching forward,\r\nthey strained their hearing.  'You shall zink all night ... shoot you\r\ndead. Understand?'\r\n\r\nThere was silence.  Trentham's and Hoole's eyes met.\r\n\r\n'Hahn?' murmured Trentham.\r\n\r\nHoole nodded.\r\n\r\n'Bullying Meek,' he whispered.\r\n\r\nTrentham cast his eye along the irregular line of boulders.  A few yards\r\nfrom the spot where they were crouching, two jagged rocks, between four\r\nand five feet high and about three feet wide at the base, stood almost\r\nparallel with the edge of the slope, and about two feet apart.  Crawling\r\nto them, Trentham pushed them gently from behind, then more firmly,\r\nfinally with all his strength.  They did not yield by the smallest\r\nfraction of an inch.  Carefully marking their position, the two men\r\nclambered back among the boulders, gained the top of the ridge more\r\nquickly than they had descended, and hastened to rejoin their party,\r\nguiding themselves by the trunks of trees and bushes which Hoole had\r\nbeen careful to 'blaze' as they came.  There was just light enough to\r\nsee the marks.\r\n\r\nWhen they regained the thicket where they had left the others, Grinson\r\ncame forward eagerly to meet them.\r\n\r\n'Any luck, sir?' he asked anxiously. 'Did ye find Ephraim?'\r\n\r\n'We know pretty well where he is,' replied Trentham.\r\n\r\n'Safe and sound?'\r\n\r\n'That I can't say exactly, but he 's sound enough to make Hahn call him\r\na pig.'\r\n\r\n'Pig!  A lamb like Ephraim!  By thunder, sir, if I get my fingers on\r\nthat there Hahn I 'll teach him!  Ephraim a pig! Blast my--\r\n\r\n'Steady, Grinson,' interrupted Hoole. 'Meek isn't damaged by Hahn's\r\nabuse. Things are more serious than that.  From what we overheard, it's\r\npretty sure that Meek has refused to do something that Hahn ordered.'\r\n\r\n'Good lad!  I 'll----'\r\n\r\n'Wait.  Hahn has given him all night to think it over; he threatens to\r\nshoot him.'\r\n\r\nGrinson was silenced.  His heat was quenched by speechless care.  Fixing\r\nhis eyes anxiously on Trentham, he said quietly:\r\n\r\n'Anything you order, sir.'\r\n\r\n'We 'll save him if we can,' said Trentham. 'We 've hard work in front\r\nof us, but with care and good fortune--by the way, Hoole, can you find\r\nyour way back in the dark?'\r\n\r\n'The moon 's up, my son.  She 's riding low, but she 'll last long\r\nenough for this stunt, I reckon.'\r\n\r\n'Good!  Now, Grinson, cut a stout pole from a tree--as strong as you can\r\nfind, three to four feet long.'\r\n\r\n'Ay, ay, sir!' responded the boatswain, whipping out his knife.\r\n\r\nWhile he was gone about his task, Trentham explained to Lafoa, the\r\ninterpreter, that the position of the prisoners had been roughly\r\nlocated, and asked him to inform the rest of the party.  They would have\r\nto march to the cliff in the waning moonlight, keeping absolute silence,\r\nand be ready to do instantly and exactly what they were ordered.  The\r\nsafety of their chief Flanso and his fellow prisoners would depend on\r\ntheir prompt obedience.\r\n\r\nOn Grinson's return, Trentham ordered one of the men to unwind the rope\r\nfrom his body, and the boatswain to fasten one end of it to the pole.\r\nHe then slung the pole over a thick branch of a tree, and bade half the\r\nparty of natives hang on to it, while Grinson and the other half held\r\nthe loose end of the rope.  The test being satisfactory, and the rope\r\nhaving been wound over the pole, they formed up in single file, and,\r\nHoole leading, set out over their former tracks for the cliff.  Not a\r\nword was spoken.  The bare feet of the natives made no sound; the\r\nfootsteps of the white men could scarcely have been heard if any\r\nwatchers had been lurking in the bush.  The rays of the moon, near its\r\nsetting, gave Hoole light enough to distinguish the blazed trees, and\r\nthey marched rapidly.  Presently the prevailing stillness was invaded by\r\nthe soft rustle of the surf, and they caught sight of the glistening\r\npath of the moonlight stretching far across the sea.  Slackening his\r\npace a little, so as to reduce the slight sounds made by the white men's\r\nboots, Hoole led the party unerringly to the crest of the boulder-strewn\r\nslope.  There they halted.\r\n\r\nThere were whispered explanations and instructions.  Grinson, in spite\r\nof his anxiety for Meek, was a little daunted by the difficulties of the\r\nplan unfolded to him.  The exact position of the prisoners on the ledge\r\nwas unknown.  A sentry would certainly be on guard.  An incautious\r\nmovement, the accidental disturbance of a stone, a misjudgment of\r\ndistance in the dark, might involve not only the failure of the scheme,\r\nbut death to its authors.  Trentham did not minimise the dangers; they\r\nhad all been canvassed by Hoole and himself; indeed, he was prepared to\r\nfind that some factor which he had been unable to take into account\r\nwould render his plan unworkable.\r\n\r\n'But we are not going to attempt the impossible, Grinson,' he said.  'We\r\nshall first discover what 's possible, and then--well, you 're not the\r\nman to jib at a risk.'\r\n\r\n'True, sir, and Ephraim is worth it.  I 'll say no more.'\r\n\r\nThey waited until the sinking moon gave just light enough to see the two\r\nrocks which Trentham and Hoole had marked on their previous visit; then\r\nthey stole down the slope among the boulders.  For greater security the\r\nwhite men had removed their boots.  On reaching the furthermost of the\r\nboulders they halted again.  Trentham placed the log of wood across the\r\ngap between the two rocks, and got Grinson to loop the loose end of the\r\nrope under his armpits. When the moon had wholly disappeared below the\r\nhills behind, and the face of the cliff was dark, he crawled inch by\r\ninch down the bare slope, and peeped cautiously over the edge.\r\n\r\nThe cove, the beach, the ledge--all were now within his range of vision.\r\nHis eyes were first attracted by lights below.  There was a glimmering\r\nlamp on the Raider's deck forward; the deck appeared to be unoccupied,\r\nand no lights shone from the portholes. All three sheds were\r\nilluminated, and from the murmur of voices Trentham guessed that the\r\nGermans were at their evening meal.  No one was moving on the beach.\r\nThen he noticed a slight intermittent glow some distance away on his\r\nright; behind it a face was momentarily lit up.  Without doubt it\r\nproceeded from the pipe of the sentry on the ledge.  Trentham recalled\r\nthe position as he had seen it from the other side of the cove when he\r\nmade his first reconnaissance.  The sentry was evidently posted at the\r\ninner end of the ledge, where one path led to the beach, another wound\r\nround the cliff.  These were the only avenues of escape; the other end\r\nof the ledge was blocked.  The fact that the sentry was smoking argued\r\nthat discipline was less strict here than it would have been on board\r\nship; probably vigilance also was less rigid.  What had the Germans to\r\nfear from their cowed slaves, and the natives of the village they had\r\nterrorised?\r\n\r\nWithdrawing his eyes from this extremity of the ledge, Trentham could\r\njust distinguish the outlines of baskets laid against the cliff wall.\r\nThen he started, and felt his pulses quicken.  Surely that pallid object\r\nbelow him, a little to his left, was a man's face.  He closed his eyes,\r\nand reopening them after a few moments found that he could see more\r\nclearly.  Beyond doubt a white man was standing close against the wall.\r\nHis attitude was peculiarly rigid.  The explanation flashed upon\r\nTrentham; Meek was tied up.\r\n\r\nTrentham looked up and down the ledge for the native prisoners.  Black\r\nthough they were, he expected to be able to discover them, even in the\r\ndarkness, by some movement or sound.  He was as much perplexed as\r\nsurprised at discerning no sign of them.  Where, then, were they kept?\r\n\r\nMeek, however, was his first concern.  How long had the seaman been tied\r\nup?  Was he conscious, and able to assist in his release?  It was\r\nimpossible to tell.  Wriggling along the edge of the slope until he was\r\nexactly over Meek's position, Trentham took a short peg from his pocket,\r\ndrove it into the soil, and attached to it a thin line of fibre which he\r\nhad brought with him.  Then, holding the line, he crawled carefully up\r\nthe slope, and rejoined his party.\r\n\r\nIn a few whispered words he related the extent of his discoveries.\r\n\r\n'Better 'n we could expect, sir,' murmured Grinson, with a long breath\r\nof relief.  'If the look-out is smoking----'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' interrupted Trentham, 'but we mustn't rely too much on that.  He\r\nmay be relieved at any minute; we can't tell.  We must get to work while\r\nthe men are still feeding.  Ready, Hoole?'\r\n\r\n'Sure!' was the reply.\r\n\r\nFollowing the guiding line, of which Grinson now held the upper end, the\r\ntwo men crept down the slope.  Grinson understood that the line would be\r\nused to signal how to deal with the thicker rope, which was coiled round\r\nthe log laid across the two rocks. When they reached the edge, Trentham\r\ntransferred the coil of rope from his own arms to those of Hoole, who\r\nwas to descend first on to the ledge.  They were both conscious that\r\nthis was a critical moment.  A fall of earth as the rope strained over\r\nthe edge could hardly fail to arouse the sentry.  A man issuing from one\r\nof the sheds might notice, even in the dark, the white clothes of the\r\nclimber, stained though they were.  The first misfortune might be\r\navoided with care; the second was at the mercy of chance.\r\n\r\nHoole felt with his hand for a hard smooth spot upon the edge, over\r\nwhich the rope might pass without risk of displacing earth. Then he\r\npeered along the ledge from end to end.  The sentry was still smoking;\r\nno one was visible but Meek.  Sounds of talking came from the shed,\r\npunctuated by the regular recurring swish of the surf.\r\n\r\n'Good luck!' Trentham whispered.\r\n\r\nHoole gave three jerks on the thin line he carried, then slid over the\r\nedge.  The rope tightened under his armpits; the natives above slowly\r\npaid it out.  He sank out of sight, and it seemed an age to Trentham\r\nbefore two jerks signalled that he had reached the ledge.  A few seconds\r\nlater a single jerk indicated that the rope might be drawn up. When it\r\ncame over the edge, Trentham instantly passed the loop over his\r\nshoulders, repeated the signal for lowering, and in half a minute was\r\nstanding beside Hoole, close against the cliff wall.\r\n\r\nBoth were panting with excitement.  No fresh sound was added to those\r\nthey had already heard; their descent had been unperceived.\r\n\r\nEach went at once about the task previously agreed on.  Hoole took a few\r\npaces towards the sentry, and revolver in hand, stood on guard, while\r\nTrentham, with quick, silent cuts of his knife, released the\r\nhalf-unconscious seaman.\r\n\r\n'Not a word, Meek,' whispered Trentham, as he placed the loop under the\r\nman's shoulders.  'Grinson is waiting for you above.'\r\n\r\nHe jerked on the line.  Meek slowly ascended, and his clothes being\r\ndark, his form could scarcely be distinguished against the cliff.  He\r\nhad only just disappeared over the edge when a light was suddenly thrown\r\non the beach by the opening of the door of one of the sheds.  There was\r\na burst of louder talking, and a group of seamen issued forth, and\r\nambled down to a dinghy lying a few yards above the surf.  Hoole and\r\nTrentham slipped silently down, and lay flat against the wall. They\r\nheard the scrape of the boat as it was hauled over the sand, the clatter\r\nof boots as the men climbed into it, then the rattle of oars in the\r\nrowlocks.  The men were boarding the Raider; from her deck they might\r\nsee movements on the ledge.  Was this to be the end of the adventure?\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes the voices of the Germans rose from the vessel; then\r\nthey ceased, and Hoole, raising his head cautiously, saw that the deck\r\nwas clear.\r\n\r\n'Now for the sentry!' he whispered.\r\n\r\nForeseeing that the native prisoners, when they should be discovered and\r\nreleased, might hail their deliverance with shouts of joy, Trentham had\r\narranged with Grinson that Lafoa, the interpreter, should be lowered to\r\nthe ledge when he gave the signal.  But he had not expected any\r\ndifficulty in finding the prisoners' whereabouts.  The presence of the\r\nsentry showed that they were somewhere on the ledge, and he felt some\r\nanxiety lest they were near the German, and would be disturbed as Hoole\r\nwent forward to deal with him.  For this reason, when Hoole was about to\r\ngrope his way along the ledge, Trentham detained him by a whisper, and\r\nsignalled to Grinson by means of the line.  A minute later he heard a\r\nsound above as the Papuan came dangling down at the end of the rope--a\r\nsound so slight that it could not have been heard by the sentry amid the\r\nrustle of the surf.  He caught Lafoa about the body, released him from\r\nthe rope, and then, in the briefest sentences of which pidgin English is\r\ncapable, instructed him in the part he was to play presently.\r\n\r\nHoole started, stealing along inch by inch under the cliff wall, taking\r\nadvantage of its inequalities and of the baskets which were ranged in\r\nline against it.  He had gone forward only about a dozen yards, however,\r\nwhen Trentham, who could just distinguish his form, saw him halt,\r\ncrouching low.  The sentry's pipe was still emitting its glow at regular\r\nintervals as the man puffed.  It was clear that he had not been\r\ndisturbed, and Trentham, wondering why Hoole had stopped, stole forward\r\nto join him, carrying the rope with which Meek had been bound.\r\n\r\nThe American was lying almost flat, peering between the bars of a wooden\r\ngrating that covered a hole in the cliff.\r\n\r\n'Listen!' he whispered, as Trentham came up behind him.\r\n\r\nAnd then Trentham heard, from behind the grating, sounds of deep\r\nbreathing, as of many men asleep.  Nothing could be seen in the pitch\r\nblackness within; but the two men concluded that they had found the\r\nplace in which the natives were confined.  Worn out by long hours of\r\nfatiguing work to which they were unused, the prisoners, no doubt, were\r\nsleeping the heavy sleep of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nHoole was about to go forward, when he was arrested by a sound some\r\ndistance ahead. He dropped flat again, and taking up handfuls of coal\r\ndust, rubbed it all over his clothes. Trentham followed his example.\r\nThey now identified the sound as footsteps; in a few moments they heard\r\na voice, then a tapping.\r\n\r\n'Sentry being relieved; knocking out his pipe,' Hoole whispered.\r\n\r\nThey lay watching, listening, with their hearts in their mouths.  Would\r\nthe Germans come to look at the man they had tied up? Or would the\r\nrelieving sentry be satisfied by his comrade's report that all was well,\r\nand take up his post without investigation?  If both should come along\r\nthe ledge together, it was hopeless to expect that they could be\r\nsilenced without one or other having time to give the alarm.  They might\r\neven see the white clothes, in spite of the coating of coal dust, before\r\nthey came within reach.  A single shout would arouse the Germans below,\r\nand all would be over.\r\n\r\nThe footsteps drew nearer; two voices were heard.  The new sentry\r\nexchanged a few words with his comrade; then the heavy boots of the\r\nlatter rang on the path leading downwards to the beach.  The risk was\r\nhalved!  A match was struck; the newcomer lit his pipe, and for a minute\r\nor two paced up and down a short stretch of the ledge.  Hoole hoped that\r\nhe would soon tire of this, and sit, as his comrade presumably had done,\r\nsmoking placidly, dreaming perhaps of a little cottage somewhere in the\r\nFatherland.\r\n\r\nBut presently the slow footsteps approached.  The scent of tobacco smoke\r\ntouched the nostrils of the waiting men. The sentry was coming to look\r\nat his prisoner.  Trentham and Hoole crawled back silently a few yards,\r\nand effaced themselves as well as they could behind the baskets. The\r\nGerman came slowly on, humming between his closed lips.  He reached the\r\ntunnel, and stood at the grating for a few moments; the watchers saw the\r\nreflection of his glowing pipe on his face as he pressed it close\r\nagainst the bars.  Humming again, he sauntered on towards the post where\r\nMeek had been tied, walking outside the line of baskets, and passing the\r\nhidden men within a couple of yards.\r\n\r\nNow was the critical moment.  Feeling that the whole success of the\r\nenterprise hung on the next few seconds, Hoole pulled himself together,\r\ngot to his feet, and noiselessly on his stocking soles tip-toed after\r\nthe German. From below came the restless murmur of the surf.  Hoole's\r\nfootsteps could not have been heard, yet the German, perhaps moved by\r\nthat strange sense one has of being followed, was on the point of\r\nturning round, when a hard fist caught him with the force of a\r\nsledge-hammer behind his right ear, and he fell like a log.  Trentham,\r\nwho had followed stealthily, instantly dashed forward, and before the\r\nstunned man regained consciousness he was bound hand and foot with the\r\nrope that had tortured Meek, and a gag, torn from Hoole's coat, was\r\nfirmly wedged between his teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOISELESSLY ON HIS STOCKING SOLES TIP-TOED AFTER THE\r\nGERMAN.]\r\n\r\nLeaving him where he lay, the two men summoned Lafoa to join them, and\r\nled him to the tunnel.  Groping over the grating, Hoole discovered the\r\nwooden bolt with which it was fastened, quietly removed the cover, and\r\nsigned to Lafoa to go in.\r\n\r\nThere was another moment of tense anxiety.  Grunts, ejaculations, the\r\nstir of movement, were heard from the depths of the tunnel.  Something\r\nfell with a sharp crack--a pick which one of the men had displaced. At\r\nthe mouth of the tunnel it sounded like a pistol shot, and Hoole and\r\nTrentham swung round and looked apprehensively towards the beach.  All\r\nwas still, there.  No doubt the wash of the sea was loud enough to\r\nsmother the single sharp sound at a distance.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that Lafoa had intelligently grasped his instructions,\r\nfor the natives, as they filed out, though their movements were quick\r\nand urgent, made scarcely a sound. In a long string they followed\r\nTrentham to the spot where the rope dangled over the wall of the ledge.\r\nTrentham found that his hands were trembling as he slid the rope over\r\nthe shoulders of the first man.  If only he could have multiplied the\r\nrope!  Each ascent would take at least half a minute.  How many men were\r\nthere?  What might not happen before they were all in safety above? One\r\nby one he looped them, saw them rise, caught the descending rope.\r\nHoole, who had counted them out, came up to them and whispered\r\n'Thirty-four.'  More than a quarter of an hour must elapse before the\r\nlast man had ascended, and some of those at the end of the line were\r\nshowing signs of restlessness, grunting, sighing, clicking with their\r\ntongues.  Moment by moment Trentham expected some of them to whoop with\r\nexcitement.  'Make all fella no talkee!' he whispered to Lafoa, and the\r\nman went along the line muttering fierce threats.\r\n\r\nThe thirty-fourth man had gone.  Lafoa followed him, then Hoole.  Not a\r\nsound had been heard from below but the murmur of the sea and the\r\nmuffled voices of the men in the sheds.  With intense relief, and the\r\nfeeling that fortune could hardly betray them now, Trentham looped\r\nhimself and signalled to be hoisted.  He was barely half way to the top\r\nwhen a sharp clatter above made his blood run cold.  Crack followed\r\ncrack, then for a second there were a number of dull thuds, and finally,\r\na tremendous crash on the ledge below, waking echoes around the cove.\r\nOne of the natives, in climbing among the boulders, had displaced a\r\nlarge rock.\r\n\r\nThe doors of the sheds were burst open. Lights shone across the cove.\r\nMen came rushing out, calling to one another, to the sentry above, to\r\nthe men on the Raider. 'Faster!  Faster!' Trentham cried inwardly, as he\r\nwas jerked upward.  He was just over the edge when a blinding light\r\nswept across the face of the cliff.  The searchlight's beams fell full\r\nupon Trentham's white-clad form.  Slipping out of the loop, he scrambled\r\non hands and knees up the sloping ascent towards the boulders.  Below\r\nhim there was a sputtering rattle, and he felt himself splashed with\r\nearth and stones as the rain of machine-gun bullets pecked at the cliff.\r\nSomething hot stung his leg; he crawled faster; in another moment his\r\nshoulders were grasped by sinewy hands, and Grinson and Hoole between\r\nthem lugged him over the brink and behind the protecting boulders.\r\n\r\n'Thanks be for all mercies!' panted Grinson.  'And as for that clumsy\r\nlubber that kicked down the rock----'\r\n\r\n'Shoo!' whistled Hoole, 'it's time, sure, to cut and run!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                            A FORCED LANDING\r\n\r\n\r\n'For goodness' sake keep them quiet!' gasped Trentham, clambering up\r\namong the boulders to the top of the slope. The native prisoners,\r\nhysterical in their joy, were laughing and shouting and smacking their\r\nthighs.\r\n\r\n'Say, Lafoa,' said Hoole, 'tell that chief of yours to stop the\r\nhullabaloo.  Black fella no talkee this time.'\r\n\r\nFlanso gathered his men together, and reduced the hubbub somewhat.\r\nMeanwhile Trentham had gained the top.\r\n\r\n'We must get out of reach at once,' he said. 'The searchlight's no good\r\nto them now, nor the machine-gun; but if these fellows make such a row\r\nthe Germans will track us.'\r\n\r\n'We make for the village?' asked Hoole.\r\n\r\n'Not directly; the Germans are sure to put men on the paths.  But I\r\nfancy they won't risk a regular pursuit in the dark, and if we get away\r\nfrom the coast and avoid the direct route to the village, we shall at\r\nany rate not run into them.  How 's Meek?'\r\n\r\n'Just alive, sir, that's all I can say,' replied Grinson.  'What they\r\n've been doing to him----'\r\n\r\n'Can he walk?' Trentham interrupted.\r\n\r\n'Says he ain't got no feeling in his legs. But what's the odds?  I 'll\r\nheave him across my back.  Lucky you 're lean, Ephraim, me lad!'\r\n\r\n'Come, let's start at once.  Where's Lafoa?'\r\n\r\nHe explained his plan to the interpreter, who imparted it to the young\r\nchief, and the whole party moved off silently into the forest, Grinson\r\nmounting Meek pickaback.\r\n\r\nTrentham's inferences as to the actions of the enemy were better\r\njustified than he knew. All the Germans with the exception of Hahn had\r\nbeen thrown into a state of utter consternation by the discovery that\r\nMeek was not the only white man in their neighbourhood. Hahn, professing\r\nhimself to be as much surprised as the rest, had discreetly held his\r\ntongue.  Consequently the commander, ignorant of the number of the\r\nrescuers, had contented himself with posting parties of the crew on the\r\npaths which the fugitives must cross to regain their village, postponing\r\norganised pursuit until the morning.\r\n\r\nIt was slow going in the darkness.  Several of the natives who had been\r\nlongest enslaved were weak from overwork, ill-treatment, and\r\nconfinement.  The stronger among them, eager to press on, were\r\nrestrained by fear of the dark and the necessity of helping the weaker.\r\nHoole noticed that Trentham was limping.\r\n\r\n'Hurt your leg?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Got a bullet, I think, but it's nothing.'\r\n\r\n'Shucks!  Let me have a look at it right now.  You might bleed to\r\ndeath.'\r\n\r\nHe knelt down and groped for the wound.\r\n\r\n'The bullet has ploughed up a bit of your calf,' he said in a minute or\r\ntwo.  'Lucky it's no worse.  Wait half a second while I tie it up; then\r\nI guess you can go on till we strike some water.'\r\n\r\nThey went on, struggling over rough country amid thick bush and trees.\r\nEven the natives were at a loss in the darkness. They could not choose a\r\ndefinite direction, and it seemed obvious to the white men that some of\r\nthem would soon collapse.  Grinson was panting under his load, light\r\nthough it was, but steadfastly refused to allow the others to take turns\r\nwith him.  At length, coming to a patch of open ground, Trentham called\r\na halt.\r\n\r\n'We ought to be pretty safe now,' he said, 'and had better camp here\r\ntill the morning. With daylight some of the natives will be able to take\r\ntheir bearings.'\r\n\r\nThey lay down on the rough grass, already wet with dew.\r\n\r\n'How d' you feel, Ephraim?' asked Grinson, bending over the seaman.\r\n\r\n'I felt worse when I had typhoid,' said Meek faintly.  'What a lot of\r\ntrouble I do give you, Mr. Grinson--a lot of trouble.  And I ain't said\r\na word of thanks to the gentlemen.'\r\n\r\n'Don't bother about that,' said Trentham. 'Get to sleep if you can.'\r\n\r\n'Ay, go to sleep at once, Ephraim; d' ye hear, me lad?' said Grinson.\r\n\r\n'I 'll try, Mr. Grinson, and if so be I dream horrors----'\r\n\r\n'Dream!  What's dreams?  Why, many's the times I 've been drownded in my\r\nsleep. Dreams make me laugh.  (I 'll get him off, sir,' he whispered to\r\nTrentham.  'A yarn of mine has done it afore now!)  I remember once I\r\ndreamed as how I 'd got into a Salvation meeting; they was singing a\r\nhymn, but the man as played the trumpet--why, somehow the trumpet turned\r\ninto a beer bottle, and I found I was playing the trumpet myself. They\r\nall come up and thanked me afterwards for my beautiful music, and then\r\nall of a sudden I was left alone, and couldn't find my hat.  While I was\r\nhunting for it, that there trumpet fellow rushed in and pushed a\r\nrolled-up parcel into my hand.  \"Very good hat!\" says he, and when I\r\nopened it, bless you, 'twas nothing but a tea-cosy....  He 's off now,\r\nsir.  What have those devils been doing to my Ephraim?'\r\n\r\n'We 'll hear all about it to-morrow.  You had better sleep yourself,\r\nGrinson.  Tell yourself a yarn.'\r\n\r\n'No, sir; that's not my way.  I counts over the number of sweethearts I\r\n've had, and by the time I 've got to the third or fourth I 'm dead off;\r\nthey was so dull.'\r\n\r\nIt was a comfortless night on the open ground, with neither fires nor\r\nwraps to defend them against the chill air.  Either Hoole or Trentham\r\nwas always on guard, together with relays of the natives.  By the\r\nexertion of his authority Flanso kept his men fairly quiet; but the\r\nwhite men were on thorns lest even the subdued murmurs of voices should\r\nreach the ears of possible scouts.\r\n\r\nAt dawn the party was marshalled.  It had been arranged that the weaker\r\nmen among the natives should make for the village by a round-about\r\nroute, in charge of Grinson and Meek, and led by Lafoa.  Trentham and\r\nHoole intended to wait a while with Flanso and the rest, and then to\r\nscout more directly eastward in order to keep watch on the Germans.\r\n\r\nThey were just about to start when the natives pricked up their ears,\r\nand Flanso managed to make the white men understand that they were\r\nalarmed by a noise in the air. A few seconds later Hoole declared that\r\nhe heard the seaplane's engines.  Trentham signed to the natives to take\r\ncover in the surrounding bush, and with Hoole posted himself at the edge\r\nof the forest, where he might hope to escape observation.  Presently the\r\nseaplane soared over the clearing, a few hundred feet above the ground,\r\nand after circling once or twice made off south-eastwards in the\r\ndirection of the village.\r\n\r\n'They won't see our men in the forest,' remarked Trentham, 'but we had\r\nbetter start.  If they drop a bomb on the village, there 'll be a\r\nfrightful panic.'\r\n\r\nThey hurried among the trees to re-form their party, but found that the\r\nnatives, scared by the noise of this aerial monster, had disappeared.\r\nOnly one man remained, Flanso himself, armed with a spear taken from one\r\nof those who had accompanied the white men from the village.  Under his\r\nguidance they set off rapidly.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps a quarter of an hour later that Hoole caught sight of a\r\nnative among the trees on his left hand, and thinking it was one of the\r\nmissing men, shouted to him.  The man at once dashed away, uttering a\r\nshrill cry.\r\n\r\n'Kafulu!' cried Flanso excitedly, and was on the point of springing\r\nafter the traitor when a shot rang out, and a number of Germans came\r\ninto view almost directly in front of them.  The three men instantly\r\ndarted away to the right, pursued by more shots, and ran until they were\r\nout of breath.\r\n\r\n'We 've outrun them,' said Trentham; 'must have gone twice as fast as\r\nthey, burdened with their rifles.  I must rest a bit; my leg is rather\r\ngroggy.'\r\n\r\nThere was no sound of pursuit.  Presently they moved on again, but had\r\nnot gone far before they once more heard the hum of the seaplane,\r\napparently approaching from the south.  Screened by the trees, they did\r\nnot check their march until Hoole suddenly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Say, Trentham, that machine 's sure in difficulties.'\r\n\r\n'Is it?  How do you know?'\r\n\r\n'Listen!' returned Hoole with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe humming was intermittent, spasmodic, and presently ceased\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n'They 're coming down,' said Hoole, 'and not far away.  Let 's have a\r\nlook at it.'\r\n\r\n'Better push on,' said Trentham.\r\n\r\n'But it 'll do us good if the machine crashes.  I 'd be glad to know\r\nit's out of action.  Come on!'\r\n\r\nThey turned in the direction in which the sound was last heard.  Through\r\nthe close-growing trees it was impossible to see far, and Trentham\r\nprivately thought the search a waste of time; but after only a few\r\nminutes' walk they came to the edge of an open space sloping down to a\r\nstream some twenty feet wide.\r\n\r\n'It will be hereabout,' said Hoole, detaining the others at the top of\r\nthe slope.  'But I guess this trickle isn't wide enough to float it. Let\r\nus separate, and scout along the line of bushes here, up and down\r\nstream.'\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Flanso, who had gone northward, returned to the others,\r\nand told them by signs that he had discovered the machine.  Creeping\r\nback with him, they came to a bend in the stream, and there discovered\r\nthe seaplane, resting partly on two small trees, partly on a bed of\r\nrushes, and awkwardly tilted.  The two airmen had left their seats, and\r\nwere talking together on the bank, apparently consulting a compass.\r\nEvery now and again they glanced apprehensively into the bush on both\r\nsides.  Then they returned to the seaplane, walked round it, put their\r\nshoulders against the fuselage, and tried to lift it.  One of them took\r\nout his revolver, and was on the point of firing it into the air, when\r\nhis companion hastily interposed.  The two men had a brief altercation.\r\nFinally the one who had been about to fire appeared to yield to the\r\nother's warning, and they both sat down on the shelving bank, discussing\r\nthe position over again.\r\n\r\nSheltered by the dense vegetation above the watercourse, Trentham and\r\nhis companions had watched their movements with interest.  The tenor of\r\ntheir discussion was easily divined.  The seaplane could not be salved\r\nwithout help, but they hesitated to leave it, fearful of its being\r\ndiscovered by the natives, with whom, as they now knew, were white men.\r\nIf they parted company, which was to return to the cove?  The one left\r\nwould be less able to defend himself and the machine.  A revolver shot\r\nmight have brought assistance from the Germans; on the other hand, it\r\nmight attract a horde of cannibals.  What were they to do?\r\n\r\nAs they sat on the bank, they were sideways to the three men watching\r\nthem only a few feet above.\r\n\r\n'Let's rush them!' whispered Hoole suddenly.\r\n\r\nHe seized Flanso's spear, pushed his revolver into Trentham's hand, and\r\nbefore the latter could utter a word, either in assent or in\r\nremonstrance, the American was half-way down the slope.  Trentham had no\r\nchoice but to back him up, and he dashed after his friend with scarcely\r\na moment's delay.\r\n\r\nThe Germans heard the sound of Hoole's movements through the bush,\r\nturned their heads and sprang up.  One of them raised his revolver to\r\nfire, but Hoole, now only three or four yards away, launched his spear.\r\nHis sudden action flurried the German's aim, his shot flew wide, and the\r\nnext moment he fell back, cursing, and tearing the spear from his\r\nshoulder.  His companion, seeing Trentham rushing at him with levelled\r\nrevolver, hesitated a moment, and caught sight of Flanso swooping down\r\nimmediately behind the Englishman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE GERMANS RAISED HIS REVOLVER, BUT BEFORE HE\r\nCOULD FIRE, HOOLE LAUNCHED THE SPEAR AT HIM.]\r\n\r\n'Hands up!' cried Trentham, taking advantage of the man's momentary\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\nUp went his hands.\r\n\r\n'Guess we 'll borrow your revolvers, gentlemen,' said Hoole, picking up\r\nthe weapon dropped by the wounded man.  Trentham took the other man's\r\nfrom his belt.  'Keep your eye on them, Trentham,' Hoole went on, 'while\r\nI kind of size up this machine of theirs.'\r\n\r\nTrentham and Flanso stood guard over the Germans while the unwounded man\r\nbathed his comrade's arm and bound up his wound. Meanwhile Hoole\r\nexamined the seaplane in a manner that took Trentham by surprise. There\r\nwas a sureness, a purposefulness about him; he seemed to know exactly\r\nwhat he was looking for.  Indeed, he pulled the engine about, as\r\nTrentham afterwards told him, as if he were its maker.  A very few\r\nminutes' inspection sufficed to make him wise, as he put it.\r\n\r\n'Not much wrong,' he said, coming over to Trentham and smiling.  'I\r\nguess I can put it right.  But we 'll want help to get it on to the\r\nstream--yonder there, where it widens. Shall we start for home?'\r\n\r\n'And these gentlemen will come as our prisoners?'\r\n\r\n'Sure.  We haven't any coal for them to dig, but they can start on\r\nyams.'\r\n\r\n'Ve are officers; it is not correct for officers to vork,' said one of\r\nthe Germans.\r\n\r\n'Say, is that so?  You 're a lazy lot?  Well now!  And yet you 'll make\r\na chief dig coal for you--a chief who 's as big a man here as your\r\nKaiser in Berlin.  Well, you surprise me!  Come along, Trentham.  Let's\r\nhurry.'\r\n\r\n'How far are we from the coast?' asked Trentham of the Germans as they\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n'Eight or nine mile,' was the surly response.\r\n\r\n'Bully!' exclaimed Hoole.  'With luck we 'll have time to salve the\r\nmachine before it's found.  Step along, Flanso!'\r\n\r\n'Ze niggers vere ve go--are zey cannibals?' asked one of the Germans\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' replied Trentham.  'They nearly ate us.  They mistook us for\r\nGermans.'\r\n\r\nThe prisoners asked no more questions.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving the seaplane, Hoole pointed out why it had come down\r\nin this part of the forest.  The stream widened into a small lake, on\r\nwhich, when their engine failed, the Germans had tried to alight.\r\nUnable to reach it, they had been forced to come down on the bank of the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nFlanso scouted ahead, every now and then stopping to listen for signs of\r\nthe Germans. Once, when they were rounding a spur where the vegetation\r\nwas thin, Trentham clapped his hand over the mouth of one of the Germans\r\njust as he was about to shout.\r\n\r\n'We 'll have to gag this fellow, Hoole,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Sure.  Another rag from my coat.  And look you here, you officers, if\r\nyou make a sound, barring a natural grunt, we 'll leave you to our\r\nfriend Flanso.  See?'\r\n\r\n'The native yonder,' explained Trentham. 'You had him on your ledge, you\r\nknow.'\r\n\r\nThe threat was enough.  For the rest of the march the Germans were\r\ndocility itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                              AN INTERLUDE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the village the returning party found Grinson alone,\r\nstanding in the middle of the path, his knife in his right hand, a spear\r\nin his left, and a dozen other spears on the ground beside him.  Neither\r\nMeek nor any of the natives was to be seen.\r\n\r\n'What's the meaning of this, Grinson?' asked Trentham.\r\n\r\n'Ignorance, sir--just ignorance, poor heathens!' replied the boatswain,\r\ncocking his thumb towards the village.  'That there airy plane sailed\r\nover a while ago, and the savages all did a bunk, screeching like one\r\no'clock, though I roared myself black in the face telling 'em 'twas only\r\na sort o' bird. 'Twas no good; like as I 've seed cows and sheep bolt\r\nwith their tails up from a railway train.  They was scared stiff, there\r\n's no mistake; and I 'spect they 're hiding their heads somewhere.'\r\n\r\n'And Meek?'\r\n\r\n'I sent Ephraim straight into our hut, sir, and seeing as how the whole\r\nplace was left undefended, like, I took up my station here. Germans,\r\nsir?' he added in a whisper, winking towards the prisoners.\r\n\r\n'Yes; their machine came down.  We 'll leave them in your charge, as we\r\nwant to take a gang back to bring in the machine.  You had no trouble on\r\nthe way home?'\r\n\r\n'Not a bit, sir, except that they 've no notion whatever of the proper\r\nway of marching--more like a lot of colts they was; but there, I hadn't\r\nthe heart to correct 'em, they was so uncommon pleased to be free\r\nagain.'\r\n\r\nThe party had not interrupted their march. Grinson had picked up his\r\nspears and fallen in step beside Trentham.  As they passed along the\r\npath, from behind the huts and the midst of the plantations native heads\r\nappeared one by one, and when the timorous people recognised their young\r\nchief they came bounding out with yells of delight, until by the time\r\nthe inner enclosure was reached the whole population had joined the\r\nprocession.  At the gate the patricians were assembled, headed by the\r\ntemporary chief.  They welcomed Flanso with some show of dignity, and\r\nconducted him to the chief's house, bowing low as he entered the\r\ndoorway.  The two prisoners were placed under guard in an empty hut, and\r\nthen Trentham hurried after Flanso, and with the aid of the interpreter\r\nexplained the course of action which had been arranged between himself\r\nand Hoole during the homeward march.\r\n\r\nTrentham found himself contending with the natives' absolute\r\nincomprehension of the value of time.  Flanso was already occupied in\r\ndiscussing with his elders the details of his approaching installation.\r\nNo western monarch could have been more deeply absorbed in the\r\nceremonies that were to inaugurate his reign.  The hardships from which\r\nhe had been rescued, the dangers that still threatened him and his\r\npeople, seemed to have vanished from his mind, and it was only by dint\r\nof patience and pertinacity that Trentham succeeded in capturing his\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that the Germans, enraged at the loss of their prisoners,\r\nwould certainly seek to regain them, and also to wreak vengeance upon\r\nthe community; nor would their animus be lessened when they discovered\r\nthat their airmen had fallen into the enemy's hands.\r\n\r\n'Chief say Toitsche fella no belongina find out that,' said the\r\ninterpreter, after an interruption from Flanso.  'Black fella belongina\r\neat white fella chop-chop.'\r\n\r\n'Tell chief what he say all belongina gammon,' cried Trentham, and\r\nproceeded to explain as well as he could from the slender resources of\r\npidgin English that the Germans might be valuable at least as hostages.\r\nIt took some time to get this theory understood and accepted; then it\r\nwas an equally long and difficult task to persuade him that the seaplane\r\nwould be of any value to him. What was the good of it?  It only\r\nfrightened his people.  To fetch it involved the risk of falling into\r\nthe power of the Germans. Trentham managed to make him understand that\r\nthe loss of the machine would greatly cripple the enemy's operations;\r\nand further, that if Hoole succeeded in repairing it, it might be used\r\nto bring help from friendly white men, who would eat up the Germans, and\r\ndeliver the natives for ever from them. Flanso was rather impressed by\r\nthese statements, though he said that his people would probably prefer\r\nto eat up all the Germans themselves; and Trentham realised the danger\r\nof employing metaphorical language. Ultimately he brought Flanso to\r\nconcede his request--to despatch a party of able-bodied men to transport\r\nthe seaplane from its present position to the village.\r\n\r\n'I feel utterly done up,' he said, mopping his brow, when he returned to\r\nthe others. 'Jabbering pidgin English for an hour is worse than penal\r\nservitude.  And it's such frightful loss of time; the Germans may have\r\ndiscovered the machine by now.'\r\n\r\n'Don't worry,' said Hoole.  'It was flying so low that I guess they\r\ncouldn't have seen it come down, and when they miss it they may hunt for\r\nit for a day or two in the forest and not find it, except by a fluke.  I\r\ndon't figure out that they 'll have all the luck.  Anyway, choose your\r\nmen, and I 'll take 'em out; you 've done your share of the business. I\r\n'll take Grinson, he 's a hefty man, and may have a notion or two.'\r\n\r\nFortunately the chief's obstinacy had no counterpart among the Papuans\r\noutside the enclosure.  The released prisoners had done nothing since\r\ntheir return except relate over and over again the details of their\r\nsufferings and the manner of their escape.  Their friends listened\r\nawestruck to the tale, and gasped as they heard of the dangling rope,\r\nthe lightning which had gleamed upon the cliff, the crackling thunder,\r\nthe strange stones that flew singing through the air; and they looked\r\nwith wondering admiration upon the white men who had saved their\r\nfellows, not only from the tyrants who had enslaved them, but even from\r\nthe powers of nature which those tyrants had at command. Trentham and\r\nHoole thus found themselves to be regarded with veneration, and when the\r\ninterpreter, prompted by Trentham, explained that the white men required\r\nthe services of twenty strong men to bring in the great sea-bird which\r\nwas another part of the enemy's magic, there was no lack of volunteers\r\neager to undertake the work.  Another score were selected as scouts, and\r\nwhen these understood that the object to be carried was bulky, and could\r\nnot easily be conveyed through thick forest, they announced that they\r\nknew a way less obstructed by vegetation, which would be more\r\nconvenient, though less direct.\r\n\r\nUnder their guidance the party reached the stream some distance above\r\nthe spot where the seaplane lay.  Feeling their way cautiously along the\r\nbank, they came at length in sight of the machine, which to all\r\nappearance remained exactly as it had been left.  Hoole took the\r\nprecaution to post a screen of scouts around the position to give\r\nwarning if the enemy should approach, then he sent Grinson to detach the\r\nwings.  A handy man, like all British seamen, Grinson soon accomplished\r\nhis task, with the aid of tools discovered among the airmen's outfit.\r\nWithin a shorter space of time than Hoole had deemed possible the work\r\nwas finished. The wings were entrusted to two men apiece; the body of\r\nthe machine was hoisted on the shoulders of the rest of the party; and\r\nalthough they met with considerable difficulties at rough and steep\r\nplaces on the return journey, once being saved from catastrophe only by\r\nthe succour of Grinson's sturdy muscles, they bore their burden without\r\nmishap to the village, and carried it up the central path amid the\r\njoyous shouts of the populace.  Some of the men, now that the strange\r\nbird was evidently helpless, showed their bravery by casting their\r\nspears at it, and their dexterity by failing to hit any of the bearers.\r\nAt this Hoole fairly lost his temper, and rushed among the throng,\r\nsmiting them right and left with his fists. This unusual mode of\r\ncorrection was effectual. The men who were sent spinning picked\r\nthemselves up with an air of surprise, while their comrades shouted with\r\nlaughter, in which the culprits themselves by and by joined.  For\r\nsafety's sake Hoole had the machine carried into the inner enclosure,\r\nwhere it was inspected with more decorum and shyness by the patricians,\r\nand with contempt by the medicine-man, who demonstrated his assurance by\r\nstroking the petrol tank and afterwards licking his greasy fingers.  The\r\ngrimaces he made were so much like those he was accustomed to display\r\nfor professional purposes that his discomfort passed unnoticed except by\r\nthe white men.\r\n\r\nTrentham came out of his hut rubbing his eyes.\r\n\r\n'Yes, I 've been asleep,' he said, in answer to Hoole's inquiring look.\r\n'A pretty warden of the camp I should make.  But the fact is, these\r\npeople are hopeless.  I tried to make them understand that the Germans\r\nmight be upon us at any minute--no good!  They appear to be entirely\r\ntaken up with some sort of mumbo-jumbo, and can't attend to anything\r\nelse.  So I simply gave in, trusting that if the Germans did appear the\r\npeople would be scared into reasonableness.  The wall, of course, is\r\nproof against anything less than a four-pounder.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I guess you did right,' said Hoole, 'and after thirty odd hours\r\nwithout it, a little sleep would comfort me some.  As to the Germans, I\r\n'm pretty sure they 'll do a bit of reconnoitring before they attack.\r\nThe surprise of those two airmen wasn't put on; it's clear that Hahn\r\nsaid nothing about us, and they 'll be wondering how many there are of\r\nus.  And so, my son, we must persuade Flanso to keep some scouts out\r\nwith their eyes lifting.  With proper notice we could put up some sort\r\nof defence.  But I hope we 'll get away before it comes to that.'\r\n\r\n'You can repair the machine, then?'\r\n\r\n'I reckon I can, if I can get hold of a forge. But I 'm dead tired, so I\r\n'll turn in, if you 'll keep your eyes open a while.  So long!'\r\n\r\nThat evening, as the four men sat together once more in their hut, the\r\ntwo younger drew from Meek the story which he had already related to\r\nGrinson on the way home.  It was a very colourless narrative--a recital\r\nof the cold facts in the fewest possible words, without a touch of\r\npassion or indignation. Grinson, however, was not the man to leave his\r\nmate's story unadorned.\r\n\r\n'He 's an 'ero, gentlemen, that's what Ephraim is!' he declared.  'If\r\never he gets back to the old country, I lay the name of Ephraim\r\nMeek--ay, and his picter too--will be in all the newspapers.  I 'll see\r\nto that. And the cinemas too; by gosh, I hear 'em now, the cheers of the\r\nlittle kiddies and the sobs of the women and gals when they see Ephraim\r\ntied up, like that chap as defied the lightning, bidding of them German\r\nruffians to do their worst; he 'd never dig coal for them, not him!\r\nP'r'aps one of you young gentlemen will make a pome out of it, like that\r\none about \"the boy stood on the burning deck,\" you remember, or one I\r\nused to know years ago when I went to school, about a British Tommy.  I\r\ndon't rightly recollect it, but 'twas a Tommy in some heathen land as\r\nwouldn't bob his head to an idol, or thing of the sort, though they\r\nkilled him for it.  'Twud be a shame if Ephraim wasn't put into some\r\npome too--an 'ero like him!'\r\n\r\n'I ain't got the figger of an 'ero, Mr. Grinson,' said Meek.  'Now if it\r\nwas you--a-going off singing to be eat--that 'ud made a picter. I\r\ncouldn't sing if 'twas me--I 'm sure I couldn't.'\r\n\r\n'Why, that was only like a sheep bleating on the way to the\r\nslaughter-house--'eroes don't baa.  Ain't I right, gentlemen?'\r\n\r\n'What do you say, Hoole?' said Trentham, feeling somewhat at a loss.\r\n\r\n'Well,' drawled Hoole, 'I guess heroes ain't _cheap_, anyway, and I 'm\r\nproud to know two, that's sure.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                                DUK-DUK\r\n\r\n\r\nTrentham took turns with Hoole and Grinson to keep watch through the\r\nnight, leaving Meek to the recuperative force of sleep.  No untoward\r\nincident disturbed the hours of darkness, but there was a good deal of\r\nnoise in the village, the men chattering incessantly.\r\n\r\n'Reminds me of the meetings of our old Urban District Council,' remarked\r\nGrinson once, when Hoole relieved him.  'Fust one, then another, then\r\nall together--and nothing settled after all.'\r\n\r\n'I guess they 're fixing something,' replied Hoole.  'In my country\r\nthere 's a good deal of clack when we elect a new president.  It's a new\r\nchief here, you know.'\r\n\r\n'Which it means a coronation, p'r'aps, or a beano of some sort, sir.\r\nWell, we 'll see, if we live long enough.  Good night, sir.'\r\n\r\nHoole had taken the precaution to have the seaplane placed near the hut.\r\nIn the morning, as soon as it was light, he made a more thorough\r\nexamination of the machine than had been possible before.\r\n\r\n'What precisely is wrong with it?' asked Trentham.\r\n\r\n'Luckily not much,' said Hoole.  'These Huns are no sports or they 'd\r\nhave risked the few miles back to the cove.  A couple of flying wires\r\nare broken--that 's nothing--but see here, the water jacket round this\r\ncylinder is cracked; the water (for cooling purposes, of course) will\r\nall run out, and cause the engine to overheat.  That's why they came\r\ndown, though, as I said, I 'd have risked it; all the same, it wouldn't\r\nbe safe to risk a flight of any length, and the thing must be repaired.\r\nThe mischief is, we 've got no solder, and you can't mend a crack in\r\nmetal without that, or something equivalent.'\r\n\r\n'But you said, when you first saw it, that it _could_ be repaired.'\r\n\r\n'Well, yes, I did; forgetting for the moment where we are.  You haven't\r\nseen anything in the shape of a forge anywhere around, have you?'\r\n\r\n'No, but I suppose they must have one, or they couldn't make their\r\nspears.  I 'll ask the interpreter.'\r\n\r\nBut the word _forge_ was unknown to the interpreter, and Trentham's\r\neffort to explain in pantomime, by blowing an imaginary pair of bellows,\r\nproved fruitless.\r\n\r\n'Well, I 'll go and look around,' said Hoole. 'And meanwhile, old son,\r\ndon't you think you 'd better persuade the chief to send out some\r\nscouts?  If the Germans do have a notion to attack us, five minutes'\r\nwarning would give us time to get every one inside the wall.'\r\n\r\n'I 'll try.  He may be more amiable than he was last night.'\r\n\r\nHoole perambulated the village for some time before he discovered what\r\nhe sought. At last, however, within a narrow enclosure behind the huts,\r\nhe noticed a young man sitting on a frame-like chair, and vigorously\r\nworking two long sticks up and down.  A low fence prevented Hoole from\r\nseeing the object of these energetic movements, but a little smoke and\r\nan acrid smell like that which comes from a blacksmith's forge drew him\r\nnearer, and looking over the fence, his eyes gleamed at what he saw.\r\n\r\nIn front of the native stood two long cylinders of bamboo, about three\r\nfeet high. From a hole in the base of each ran a thin bamboo pipe; the\r\ntwo pipes converged and met at a small heap of glowing charcoal, which\r\nburnt more brightly with each thrust of the sticks as the native worked\r\nthem alternately up and down in the cylinders.  Hoole jumped over the\r\nfence, and eagerly examined this primitive forge.  At the lower end of\r\neach of the sticks was fastened a huge bunch of feathers, resembling a\r\nmop; and these, pumped up and down, caused a considerable draught, by\r\nmeans of which the smith blew his fire to a heat sufficient to soften\r\niron.\r\n\r\n'Eureka!' cried Hoole, exulting.\r\n\r\nHe dashed back to the chief's enclosure, got his permission to have the\r\nforge brought within the wall, and in half an hour was busily engaged in\r\nthe preliminary work of repairing the water jacket.\r\n\r\n'It will be done by this evening,' he explained to Trentham.  'To-morrow\r\nI 'll be off to Wilhelmshafen or any other old place where I can find a\r\nwhite man, and then----'\r\n\r\n'There 's enough petrol?'\r\n\r\n'Enough for the flight out; I 'll get more when I land.  Say, though, we\r\nshall have to take the machine to the sea.  She can't run off, has only\r\nfloats.  That's a pity--waste of time, not to speak of the risk of\r\ncoming up against the Germans.'\r\n\r\n'But there 's an opportunity of getting the machine carried to the sea\r\nwithout a special journey.  I 've heard some news while you were away.\r\nIt appears that some sort of ceremony inaugurating the new chief is to\r\ntake place at our old wreck to-night.  All these Frenchified men are\r\ngoing with him in procession, with a certain number of the other\r\nfellows.  We must get him to let his men carry the 'plane at the same\r\ntime.'\r\n\r\n'They go down the chimney?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; it's the nearest way.'\r\n\r\n'The narrow way that leads to destruction! How on earth are we to get\r\nthe machine down there?'\r\n\r\n'With ropes, man.  We 've tested the quality of their ropes already, and\r\nthe women work so uncommonly fast that they 'll have new ropes the right\r\nlength in plenty of time. I 'll go and see the chief about it at once.\r\nHe 's very much preoccupied, and vastly self-important, but he allowed\r\nme to send out scouts, as you suggested, and I dare say I can talk him\r\nover.'\r\n\r\nFlanso was quite willing that the seaplane should form part of his\r\nprocession.  His vanity appeared to be flattered; he was as much pleased\r\nas a Lord Mayor of London who has secured some novelty for his show. But\r\nwhen the carriers had been chosen, an unforeseen difficulty arose.  The\r\nmedicine-man, whose office gave him access to the chief at all times,\r\nstrutted into Flanso's house, where the elders of the community were\r\ndiscussing the details of the approaching ceremony, and vigorously\r\nprotested against the seaplane being allowed to leave the village. In a\r\nvehement oration he declared that the strange bird must have some\r\nconnection with the totem of the tribe, and that while it remained with\r\nthem the village would be safe from hostile attack.  Some of the elders\r\nbacked him up, and Flanso, torn between his own superstitions and his\r\nsense of loyalty to the white men who had rescued him, sought relief\r\nfrom his perplexities by sending for Trentham, and putting the case\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nTrentham had sufficient diplomacy to conceal his amusement, and also a\r\ncertain irritation at the threat to his scheme.\r\n\r\n'Tell chief,' he said to the interpreter, 'medicine-man fella he savvy\r\nlot.  Big bird belongina totem all right; all same big bird he fly long\r\nway, bring back lot of white fella; they fight bad white fella this\r\nside, eat bad white fella all up.'\r\n\r\nAt this moment, unluckily, one of the scouts returned with the report\r\nthat the big ship no longer lay in the cove, and that all the white\r\nfellas had disappeared.  Grinning with triumph, the medicine-man\r\ninstantly claimed that this fact proved his case; the loss of the big\r\nbird had evidently rendered the enemy helpless, and there was nothing\r\nfurther to be feared from them.  Trentham, surprised as he was at the\r\ndeparture of the Raider, and suspecting that the Germans were probably\r\nsetting a trap, strained his vocabulary of pidgin to the utmost to\r\ncounteract the medicine-man's arguments, and ultimately prevailed on the\r\nchief to abide by the promise he had given.  The medicine-man and his\r\nsupporters were patently annoyed.  They left the hut in undisguised\r\nill-humour, and Trentham had an uneasy feeling that they would still\r\ngive trouble.\r\n\r\nThe procession was to start soon after sunset, so that it might reach\r\nthe wreck in time for the ceremony to take place at the height of the\r\nmoon.  It was late in the afternoon before Hoole had completed his\r\nrepairs, and after making a good meal the four white men were sitting in\r\ntheir tent, awaiting the moment for starting.\r\n\r\n'What's up, Trentham?' asked Hoole. 'You look very sick.'\r\n\r\n'I 've been thinking we 're mugs, that's all,' said Trentham.  'With the\r\nchief and all his fighting men away, and us too, what defence has the\r\nvillage if the Germans take it into their heads to attack?'\r\n\r\n'Gee!  I 've been so busy that I hadn't given it a thought.  But the\r\nGermans are out for slaves; they won't find any able-bodied men here.'\r\n\r\n'That's true; but you saw what they did to that village in the forest.\r\nThey 're capable of burning the whole place down, and shooting the women\r\nand children, from sheer revenge and spite.  Hadn't we better wait till\r\nthe chief returns before we start on our own scheme?'\r\n\r\nFor a few moments Hoole pondered in silence.\r\n\r\n'The Raider has gone,' he said at length. 'This means that there can't\r\nbe many Germans left behind; for, of course, they haven't all gone.  If\r\nthe natives didn't see any, it's because they 're still searching in the\r\nwoods for the seaplane.  Is it likely that the few left will attack?\r\nThere is a risk, I admit, and my proposition is that you remain here\r\nwith Meek and give an eye to things, while I take Grinson to fix on the\r\nplanes and see me off.  The sooner I get help the better, and the\r\nopportunity seems too good to be missed. What do you say?'\r\n\r\n'Very well.  I should have liked to see the ceremony, but--we simply\r\ncan't leave the most helpless of the people to the Huns' tender mercies.\r\nWhat in the world is this?'\r\n\r\nAt this exclamation the others, whose backs were towards the gate,\r\nturned about. Through the gate was filing an extraordinary procession.\r\n\r\n'By cripes!' said Grinson.  'Is it Jack in the Green, or Guy Fawkes\r\nGuy?'\r\n\r\nA line of a dozen uncouth figures was slowly approaching.  Above legs\r\nbared to the thighs bulged a mass of leaves nine or ten feet in\r\ncircumference, crowned by a headdress like a candle extinguisher, from\r\nwhich rose a pole, fantastically coloured, four or five feet in height,\r\nwith tufts of feathers and leaves at the top.  Except the legs, no part\r\nof the human form could be seen.\r\n\r\nThese strange figures came slowly across the enclosure, until they\r\nreached the seaplane, the chief and all his men watching them in dead\r\nsilence.  Encircling the machine, they stooped until the leaves touched\r\nthe ground; then, at a harsh cry from their leader, they leapt into the\r\nair and began to dance; their leafy clothing rustled; the poles wobbled\r\nand swayed; their legs bent and straightened; and as they swung round\r\nand round the seaplane they uttered shrill cries ever increasing in\r\nintensity.  The white men looked on in amazement.  What was the meaning\r\nof these antics?  Flanso and his men seemed to be impressed.  Trentham\r\nbeckoned to the interpreter.\r\n\r\n'What all this?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'This duk-duk,' replied the man in an awed whisper.\r\n\r\n'Duk-duk!  What is duk-duk?'\r\n\r\n'Big medicine.  Duk-duk dance; that say big bird no go away; white fella\r\nall belongina afraid.'\r\n\r\nHoole whistled.\r\n\r\n'That's the stunt, is it?  By gosh, Trentham, it must be that old\r\nmedicine-man thinking he 'll scare us stiff.  He 's gotten a kind of\r\naffection for the machine.  Well, Grinson, come along with me.'\r\n\r\nHe rose slowly, walked towards the seaplane, dodging between two of the\r\ndancers, and got into the seat behind the engine. Grinson had followed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'Just go to the propeller, Grinson,' he said, 'and swing it round five\r\nor six times when I give you the wink.'\r\n\r\nThe dancers had drawn closer to the machine, yelling more shrilly than\r\never. Hoole watched them with a smile as they circled round.  Suddenly\r\nhe gave the sign; Grinson caught the propeller, and with a heave of his\r\nbrawny arm swung it about. Hoole nodded to him to step aside.  The\r\nleader of the dance was just approaching, when there was a roar; Hoole\r\nhad started the engine, and the propeller whizzed round with\r\never-increasing velocity.  The dancer stopped short; before he could\r\ncollect himself or retreat the air set in motion by the whirring\r\npropeller smote him with hurricane force, stripping the leaves from his\r\nbody, and whirling his headdress, pole and all, across the enclosure.\r\nThere stood revealed the lean, naked form of the medicine-man.  He threw\r\nup his hands as if to defend his face from the blast; then, with a yell\r\nof fury, he sprinted to the gate, followed by the rest of the dancers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LEADER OF THE DANCERS WAS JUST APPROACHING WHEN THERE\r\nWAS A ROAR, AND THE WHIRRING PROPELLER SET UP A HURRICANE WHICH CAUGHT\r\nAT HIS DRESS.]\r\n\r\nA great roar of laughter burst from the spectators, hitherto silent, and\r\nfrom the crowd which had gathered outside.\r\n\r\n'I guess the duk-duk won't quack so loud in future!' said Hoole,\r\nrejoining the others.\r\n\r\nThe medicine-man's attempt to retain the seaplane and demonstrate his\r\nown importance had ignominiously failed.  His erstwhile supporters had\r\nno more to say.  The carriers were called up; the chief's procession was\r\nformed, and when the red moon rested on the horizon they set forth\r\nsolemnly towards the ancestral wreck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                                 FLIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n'I don't think nothing of this 'ere percession, sir--nothing at all,'\r\nsaid Grinson, tramping beside Hoole.  'It ain't my idea of a\r\npercession--not by a long chalk.  I 've seed hundreds of Lord Mayor's\r\nShows, and King George a-going to be crowned.  They was somethink\r\nlike--everybody moving like clockwork, 'cept the horses, and they did\r\ntheir best.  But these 'ere cannibals ain't got a notion o' keeping\r\nstep.  Look at 'em!  What's the good of their drums, I 'd like to know?\r\nWhy don't they tap out the left-right, as you may say, so 's they will\r\nmarch proper?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I guess they 're children of nature,' said Hoole with a smile.\r\n\r\n'Brought up very bad, then, that's all I can say, sir.  I 'm glad I 'm\r\nnot a child of nature, but of respectable parents, and uncles and aunts\r\nthe same.  My old Aunt Maria, now, she was real respectable, and no\r\nmistake. I used to go and see her when I was a nipper. Fust thing she 'd\r\ndo, she 'd wipe me nose.  It ain't much of a nose--not like\r\nEphraim's--p'r'aps he didn't have his wiped so often, so it growed\r\nbetter....  Why, save us, sir--did you hear that?'\r\n\r\nBoth the men turned round.  From the rear of the procession came the cry\r\nof a white man in mortal peril.  The moonlight, striking along the leafy\r\navenue through which they were passing, revealed the hideously painted\r\nfaces of the Papuans, some of whom were carrying live pigs for the feast\r\non the shore. Again rose the startling cry.  The two men, stepping among\r\nthe trees to avoid hindering the march, walked back quickly, and\r\npresently saw, among the black faces, the pale, terrified features of\r\nthe German prisoners, whom rough hands were dragging along at the tail\r\nof the procession.  An explanation of their presence flashed upon Hoole.\r\nBaulked of their human prey before, the cannibals had determined that\r\nthis time the custom of their tribe should be followed. The inauguration\r\nof their chief should not pass without its human sacrifice.\r\n\r\n'Hi, you blackguards!  What about my goose?' cried Grinson, and was\r\nrushing to the rescue when Hoole detained him.\r\n\r\n'It's no use tackling these hobos,' said the latter.  'They 'd fly at\r\nyou like dogs.  Keep pace with them; I 'll run on and talk to the\r\nchief.'\r\n\r\nHoole sprinted up the line, past the Papuans, carrying food and\r\ncooking-pots, past the drummers and the men who bore the seaplane, past\r\nspearmen and dancers, and the retinue of patricians who followed\r\nimmediately behind Flanso.  Laying a hand on the chief's arm, he\r\nremembered that the interpreter had been left in the village, and\r\nwondered nervously how he was to make Flanso understand.  To speak in\r\nEnglish would be useless; he knew but a word or two of the native\r\nlanguage.  Suddenly he remembered the chief's remote French extraction,\r\nand the impression made on his father by Trentham's use of French.\r\nCould that be turned to account?  To explain in French what he desired\r\nwas beyond him, even if Flanso could understand a continuous speech;\r\nwhat alternative was there? Perhaps if he could remember some French--a\r\nFrench poem, say--and declaim it with appropriate gestures, it might\r\nproduce the moral effect which was the first necessity at the moment.\r\nHoole was a good elocutionist and amateur actor.  Racking his memory for\r\nthings learnt at school, he could recall but one poem, a song of\r\nBeranger's that had taken his fancy.  He posted himself at the head of\r\nthe procession, and facing Flanso, spread his arms to signify that no\r\nfurther advance was to be made.  Impressed by his determined mien, the\r\nnatives halted.  And then Hoole, raising himself to his full height,\r\nbegan to recite:\r\n\r\n    'Il etait un roi d'Yvetot,\r\n    Peu connu dans l'histoire.'\r\n\r\nRolling the r, he pointed dramatically to the moon,\r\n\r\n    'Se levant tard, se couchant tot,\r\n    Dormant fort bien sans gloire.'\r\n\r\nHere he shot out his right hand towards the village.  The natives\r\ngasped.\r\n\r\n    'Et couronne par Jeanneton\r\n    D'un simple bonnet de coton:\r\n    Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!\r\n    Quel bon petit roi c'etait la!\r\n      La, la!'\r\n\r\n\r\nHe accompanied the refrain with a rhythmical clapping of hands; then,\r\nwithout waiting for the mystic effect to dissipate itself, he grasped\r\nthe chief by the arm, and led him back along the halted line to the spot\r\nwhere the Germans stood paralysed in the hands of their captors.\r\nFrench, he feared, would hardly serve him now; but he pointed to the\r\nprisoners, and repeated '_Pas manger; pas manger!_' in a fiercely\r\nauthoritative voice, winding up with _'En arriere!_' and pointing\r\ntowards the village, from which they had come but a quarter of a mile.\r\nThen, stepping firmly up to the group of Papuans, he seized the arm of a\r\nbig man who clutched one of the Germans, and with a dexterous twist\r\nforced him to relax his hold.  The men snarled, but Flanso, who by this\r\ntime had apprehended what the white man was driving at, sternly ordered\r\nthe prisoners to be released.\r\n\r\n'You must take them back, Grinson,' Hoole said.  'Their hands are tied;\r\nI 'll fasten them to you so that they can't get away.  Take them back\r\nand hand them over to Mr. Trentham; then catch us up.  Bring Lafoa back\r\nwith you.'\r\n\r\n'Ay, ay, sir.  I 'll take a spear, case of accident.  And I won't be\r\nlong behind you.'\r\n\r\nHoole, sweating at every pore, as he afterwards said, gave an off-hand\r\nindication of approval to Flanso, and the march was resumed.\r\n\r\nIt was a slow and wearisome journey through the forest, and Grinson,\r\naccompanied by the interpreter, caught up the procession before it had\r\nadvanced another mile.  Many times the bearers of the seaplane had to\r\nrest; in some places trees and shrubs had to be cut down to allow its\r\npassage, and Hoole had many an anxious moment, fearing that the wires\r\nwould be bent or broken through the carelessness of his inexperienced\r\ncarriers.  But the edge of the cliff was reached without serious mishap,\r\nand in a much shorter time than he had believed to be possible.  The\r\nroute chosen by Flanso was in fact shorter by many miles than that by\r\nwhich Hahn had led the party weeks before.\r\n\r\nThe covering over the top of the chimney had been removed, and Flanso\r\nand his men nimbly climbed down one by one.  Hoole allowed all to\r\ndescend except the carriers, Grinson, and the interpreter; then he set\r\nto work to ensure the safe lowering of the machine and its detached\r\nplanes.  With the interpreter's aid he got the men to make a stout\r\nplatform of saplings extending some feet beyond the edge of the cliff,\r\nwith a hole at the chimney top.  The body of the machine was secured to\r\ntwo stout ropes which were carried round trees.  Hoole had a third rope\r\nwith a sling in which to put his feet, and this he tied firmly to a\r\ntrunk.\r\n\r\n'Now, Grinson,' he said, 'you will be in charge here, and woe betide you\r\nif you fail me!  I 'm going to let myself down into the chimney.  When I\r\ngive the word, lift the machine gently over the cliff and lower away; I\r\n'll keep an eye on it and fend it off the rocks. That's all clear?'\r\n\r\n'As clear as good beer, sir, and I only wish I had some, I 'm that dry.\r\nEphraim says there 's----'\r\n\r\n'Oh, hang Ephraim!  Stand by!'\r\n\r\nHe swung himself into the chimney and shouted 'Lower away.'\r\n\r\n'The next ten minutes,' he told Trentham afterwards, 'were an age--an\r\nepoch.  I heard Grinson yo-hoing to the natives above; he never stopped\r\nfor a moment.  How he managed to control those savages I don't know.\r\nDown came the machine, and there was I, swinging on the rope, clinging\r\nwith one hand while I guided the machine with the other.  Once it\r\ndropped suddenly on one side, and I feared the whole caboodle would\r\ncrash to the ground; but Grinson bellowed like a hurricane, the thing\r\nrighted itself, and my heart was banging against my ribs like a steam\r\nhammer.  Well, we got the fuselage down at last; the planes were a\r\nsimpler proposition, and by and by Grinson joined me on the beach, as\r\nproud as a peacock.  \"I done that in fust-rate style, sir,\" says he with\r\na broad grin.  \"You can bear me out, sir.\"'\r\n\r\nHoole was so much occupied in putting the machine together by the light\r\nof the moon that he saw little of the native ceremony. There was\r\ndrumming and dancing; at one moment the chief, followed by a group of\r\nhis men, marched solemnly to the wreck, and after tramping seven times\r\nround the broken mast, descended to the cabin.  On his return he was\r\nwelcomed with a frenzied shout. Then fires were lighted under the\r\ncooking-pots, the dance was kept up until the viands were ready, and the\r\nfeast was prolonged until the moon had travelled half-way round the sky.\r\nSatiated, the natives flung themselves on the sand and slept.\r\n\r\n'Well, sir,' said Grinson, sitting beside Hoole, close under the cliffs,\r\n'all I can say is, it's a wonder to me how they could stow away so much\r\nboiled pork without mustard or a pint of beer.'\r\n\r\nMorning dawned.  Hoole had the seaplane carried down to the sea.  The\r\ntide was rising; the sea was choppy; waves of considerable size were\r\nbreaking on the beach.\r\n\r\n'I hope she 's seaworthy, sir,' said Grinson, eyeing the machine\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n'That we 'll soon discover,' replied Hoole. 'You know what you have to\r\ndo.  When I 've pumped up and sucked in, you 'll give the propeller half\r\na dozen turns; then I 'll switch on, and you 'll skip away, or you 'll\r\nget a dose like the medicine-man.'\r\n\r\nThe whole body of natives was lined up on the beach, watching the white\r\nmen with simple curiosity.  Suddenly one of them gave a shout, and\r\npointed out to sea.\r\n\r\n'By the powers, sir, here's the Blue Raider,' cried Grinson.\r\n\r\nThe vessel had appeared round the western horn of the bay, and was\r\nstanding in as close as possible to the shore.\r\n\r\n'They must have seen us,' said Hoole. 'Rank bad luck!  Think I 'd pass\r\nfor one of the Germans, Grinson?  They 're too far off to distinguish\r\nfeatures.'\r\n\r\n'You might, sir, though I 'm ashamed to say it; but what about me?  I 'm\r\na good deal too broad in the beam.'\r\n\r\n'But you 're half in the water.  I 'll try making signs, just to keep\r\n'em quiet, for if they 're suspicious and get their guns on to me, I 'm\r\na dead man, sure!'\r\n\r\nPartly concealed by the overshadowing planes, Hoole waved his arms in\r\nimitation of the Morse signals.  From the vessel, which had now hove to,\r\na boat was lowered, and pulled towards the beach.\r\n\r\n'Now, Grinson, I must cut,' said Hoole. 'I 'll start towards them; that\r\nwill diddle them, I hope; and before they make up their minds I 'm an\r\nenemy, I guess I 'll be out of range.  Ready?'\r\n\r\nGrinson whirled the propeller; Hoole made contact and switched on, the\r\nengine started with a roar, and the seaplane glided forward in the\r\ndirection of the approaching boat. Cries of wonder broke from the throng\r\nof natives as the strange bird rose into the air. When clear of the\r\nwater it turned suddenly eastwards, and flew rapidly at a low altitude\r\nalong the coast.  The boat stopped.  A signal was fired from the vessel\r\nin the offing.  The seaplane continued on its eastward course. There was\r\na loud report which sent the natives scurrying to the foot of the cliff,\r\nand a shell burst a few yards behind the seaplane.  A few moments later\r\na shell dropped on the beach, sending up a great shower of sand and\r\nrocks. The natives scattered, some making for the chimney, others taking\r\ncover among the rocks and undergrowth.  Grinson stood for a while with\r\narms akimbo at the edge of the beach, as though defying the gunners;\r\nthen a crackle of rifle fire from the boat sent him too rushing for the\r\nchimney.  He had only just reached it when a shell fell plump into the\r\nwreck, scattering its timbers far and wide. A howl of wrath and dismay\r\nburst from the natives, and they began to swarm up the chimney, full in\r\nview of the occupants of the boat, but concealed from the Raider by a\r\nbulge in the cliff.  Bullets rained on the rocks, but the rolling of the\r\nboat rendered marksmanship difficult, and only one or two of the men\r\nsuffered slight wounds as they climbed up.  Grinson was the last to\r\nleave the beach.  When he reached the summit he stood for a moment or\r\ntwo on the platform, gazing with a grim smile at the Raider.\r\n\r\n'Blue you are, and well you may look it!' he cried.  'Row back, you\r\nlubbers; such darned bad shooting I never did see, and I 'll take my\r\ndavy as your goose 'll soon be cooked. Mr. Hoole has gone to fetch the\r\nsauce.  Ahoy, ugly mugs!  Wait for me!  I don't want to be marooned in\r\nthis 'ere forest.'\r\n\r\nAnd he set off at a trot to overtake the natives, who were already\r\ndisappearing among the trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                       THE ATTACK ON THE VILLAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the haste of their flight from the dangerous beach the natives had\r\nleft drums, cooking-pots, and other impedimenta behind, and had now\r\nnothing but their weapons to carry.  Marching light, they showed a most\r\nungentlemanly want of consideration for Grinson.  'They 're no\r\ngentlemen, Ephraim, me lad, that's flat,' he said later (they had gone\r\nseveral miles before he overtook them), 'and me panting and sweating\r\nlike any think!  I must 'a lost five pounds, if an ounce.'\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had recovered breath, he took place by Flanso's side at\r\nthe head of the procession, and quite unaware that he was transgressing\r\netiquette, kept pace with the chief, conversing by the way.\r\n\r\n'What I can't make out, Flanso, old man,' he said, 'is what this Mr.\r\nHoole is--what he was brought up to, like.  He 's only a nipper, so to\r\nspeak it, 's far as years go, and by his own account he was just larking\r\nround these 'ere seas, with more money than wits, _I 'd_ say. Well,\r\nthen, what I want to know is, how does he know about these 'ere\r\nairyplanes or seaplanes, or whatever you call 'em, handles 'em as easy\r\nas I might handle a ship's boat, and no gammon?  I know you don't\r\nunderstand a word of what I'm saying, matey, not being born such; but I\r\n'm just letting off steam, d' ye see?  In course I wouldn't say all this\r\nto the young gent's face, my manners being good as a general rule; but\r\nit ain't good to keep your thoughts bottled up, like, 'cos they might\r\nbust out sudden like the cork out of a bottle o' beer that's stood too\r\nnear the fire, and then where 'd we be, Flanso, me boy?'\r\n\r\nFlanso appeared to be gratified by the seaman's speech, and smiled\r\namiably.\r\n\r\n'You ain't half a bad-looking chap, Flanso, and if you 'd take that\r\nstick out of your nose and learn to wash yourself you 'd be quite\r\nhandsome.  'Tis a strange world, and no mistake.  There 's my Ephraim, a\r\ngood lad as cleans hisself regular like a true Christian, and speaks\r\nEnglish as well as I does myself, but nobody could say he 's a beauty;\r\nand then there 's you--'orrible dirty, speaks like a monkey, and yet got\r\na face on you as would make your fortune if so be you went into the\r\nGuards.\r\n\r\n'Things is arranged very rum, Flanso, and there 's no understanding of\r\n'em.  Them two Germans, now--they 're pretty enough with their blue eyes\r\nand flaxen hair, just the sort the girls go silly over; but their\r\n'earts, Flanso--their 'earts is blacker than you, old man. Yet I don't\r\nknow--p'r'aps--but what's the good o' spekylatin'?  Things is a puzzle,\r\nand we ain't got the brains for to work it out.'\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, and fell into a reverie from which he was suddenly\r\nawakened by a distant rifle shot.  Instantly he became the man of action\r\nagain.  He swung round, signed to the natives to halt, and put his\r\nfingers to his lips enjoining silence.  Then he hastened down the line\r\nuntil he had discovered Lafoa.\r\n\r\n'Here, you!' he said.  'You makee all fellas hold their jaw and come\r\nbunko arter me, see?  Bad fellas fightee; we go see what's up.  See?'\r\n\r\nThe interpreter nodded, and hurried to Flanso, who gave orders in his\r\nown tongue. It was clear that he looked to Grinson for leadership.  More\r\nshots rang out ahead.\r\n\r\n'That's a revolver,' murmured Grinson. 'Mr. Trentham!  Spears.  Bows and\r\narrows.'  He looked round at the natives.  'May be some good.  Fust\r\nthing is to find out exactly what's what.  Here, you, how far off--how\r\nmuchee way--your village?'\r\n\r\nThe interpreter did not understand him. Grinson groaned.\r\n\r\n'Well, makee all black fellas hidee in bushes, so no one can see.\r\nSavvy?'\r\n\r\nThis appeared clear, for the natives, at a word from Lafoa, scattered,\r\nand in a few moments were invisible.\r\n\r\n'Now come alonga me,' continued Grinson. 'Flanso too.  Come on!'\r\n\r\nFlanso leading, they wormed their way stealthily through the forest\r\ngrowth.  The sounds of conflict grew as they progressed. Presently they\r\nwere conscious of the smell of burning, and thin trails of smoke were\r\nwafted among the trees.  Coming to the outskirts of the village, they\r\nbeheld several huts blazing. At first they saw no human being, but\r\nadvancing cautiously through the thick bushes that spread behind the\r\nhuts, they came upon a Papuan squatting on the ground and rocking\r\nhimself with pain.  A question from Flanso elicited an account of what\r\nhad happened. An hour or two before, the outlying scouts had discovered\r\na number of white men marching towards the village.  They had hastened\r\nback with the news, and the white men in the village had ordered all the\r\npeople to withdraw into the inner enclosure.  The enemy had come upon\r\nthem before they were all within the wall.  Some of the people had been\r\nkilled, some wounded, others had escaped into the forest.  The huts had\r\nbeen fired, and the enemy had rushed towards the gate, but had hurriedly\r\nretreated before a shower of arrows and the fire-magic that met them.\r\nThey had posted themselves among the trees, and a little while before\r\nhad begun to shoot their hot stones over the wall.\r\n\r\nLafoa interpreted this as well as he could to Grinson, who, however,\r\nseemed to understand the position instinctively.  He bade Lafoa hasten\r\nback to the men halting in the forest a quarter of a mile behind, and\r\nbring up all the young warriors.  While the man was absent Grinson sat\r\ndown at the foot of a tree, stretched out his legs, folded his arms, and\r\npondered.  There had not been time for the Raider to reach the cove and\r\nland her crew, therefore the attackers must be relatively few in number.\r\nThey were armed with rifles; probably the rifles had bayonets;\r\ntherefore, though few in number, they were much more than a match for a\r\nthrong of untrained savages with no better weapons than bows and arrows\r\nand spears.\r\n\r\n'Which I mean to say,' said Grinson to himself, 'that is if we don't\r\ncome to close quarters, whereas and however 'tis numbers what tells in a\r\nrush, such as boarding a vessel when you 're close alongside and Admiral\r\nNelson piped all hands to repel boarders--or t'other way about, for\r\n'twas us what boarded the enemy, must 'a been, being British. That's one\r\npoint settled, Flanso, old man; we 've got to board 'em, take 'em abaft,\r\notherwise about the rump or stern, and lively too, not forgetting that\r\nMr. Trentham is for'ard banging away with his revolver, and we stand a\r\ngood chance of being bowled over in mistake, and apologies are no use,\r\nand it's our look-out, and no blame to anybody. Now I come to think of\r\nit, that point's fust and last, for if we rush 'em and don't win, why,\r\nthen nothing matters no more, and we 're all booked for the pearly gates\r\nand no mistake.  Things are getting pretty hot by the sound of it, and I\r\n'm afraid that there revolver have give out, and--ah! here come the\r\nboarding party.'\r\n\r\nLafoa stole through the brushwood followed by twenty or thirty young men\r\nof the higher caste, all moving as silently as wild animals.\r\n\r\n'Tell 'em to lay snug--otherwise doggo--while you and me and the chief\r\ngo for'ard and do a bit of spying,' said Grinson.\r\n\r\nHe crept forward with the two men, and came presently to a spot among\r\nthe trees where it was possible to get a fairly clear view of the\r\nfighting.  A number of Germans were laying piles of brushwood at the\r\nfoot of the wall; others were breaking holes in it, or enlarging slight\r\ngaps between the logs; others were bringing up more brushwood from the\r\nforest, while reports and flashes high up in some trees overlooking one\r\nside of the enclosure showed that snipers had been posted to pick off\r\nthe garrison.  For the moment none of the defenders were visible.\r\nGrinson guessed that Trentham, having exhausted or all but exhausted his\r\nammunition, was reserving himself for the inrush which without firearms\r\nit was impossible to prevent.\r\n\r\n'There 's Trousers!' thought Grinson, catching sight of Hahn, who\r\nappeared to be superintending operations.  'If I don't give him a\r\ndusting----'\r\n\r\nHe stole back to the waiting natives, whispering instructions to Lafoa\r\non the way. Half a dozen men were told off to creep through the bush and\r\ndeal with the snipers in the trees, Grinson judging that in the dense\r\nundergrowth a native with a bow and a spear should be a match for a\r\nwhite man in a tree, even though armed with a rifle.  The rest of the\r\nmen were ordered to follow him noiselessly to the edge of the clearing\r\nin front of the wall, and to dash at the enemy when he gave the word.\r\nThe slight sounds of their movements were smothered by the reports of\r\nthe rifles and the hacking at the wall.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the spot, Grinson perceived that the Germans were massing\r\nfor a determined push.  At the sound of Hahn's whistle they sprang on to\r\nthe piles of brushwood and attempted to swarm up and over the wall.\r\nGrinson could just see Trentham above the top, swinging a huge native\r\nclub. While he was looking, the pendulum swing of the weapon disposed of\r\ntwo Germans who had come within its formidable sweep.  To right and\r\nleft, however, several of the enemy had got a footing on the wall, in\r\nspite of the spears hurled by the older and weaker natives who alone had\r\nremained in the village.\r\n\r\nThen Grinson let out a bellow like the blast of a fog-horn, and sprang\r\nfrom the shelter of the trees with a spear in each hand, followed by the\r\nhorde of natives, yelling and screeching. The Germans turned in alarm to\r\ndiscover what was threatening them, dropped to their knees, and raised\r\ntheir rifles.  Only a few of them fired; the rest, disconcerted by the\r\nshower of arrows and spears which the natives let fly at them as they\r\nran, dropped their rifles and fled helter-skelter among the trees,\r\nFlanso leading his men in hot pursuit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRINSON LET OUT A BELLOW LIKE THE BLAST OF A FOG-HORN,\r\nAND SPRANG FROM THE TREES, FOLLOWED BY A HORDE OF NATIVES.]\r\n\r\nGrinson had made straight for Hahn, hurled one of his spears at him,\r\nwhich missed, and coming to close quarters, lunged at him with the\r\nother.  But as he reached forward, a bullet from one of the snipers who\r\nhad not yet been dislodged from his tree struck the boatswain on the\r\narm.  He spun round and fell on his face, just as Trentham, with Meek\r\nand a score of natives, came rushing out at the gate.  Hahn had raised\r\nhis revolver to shoot the fallen seaman, but catching sight of Trentham,\r\nhe snapped an ill-aimed shot at him, then took to his heels and followed\r\nhis men into the forest.\r\n\r\nTrentham dispatched Lafoa to recall the natives, fearing that the\r\nGermans would rally and outmatch them in a running fight; then he\r\nreturned to Grinson, who had sat up, and was trying to pull off his\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\n'Just a tickler, sir,' said the boatswain, grinning.  'I 'd a sort of\r\nfeeling that I 'd be wounded in the house of my friends, as you may say,\r\nthem being Bible words and all correct.  Easy all!  That's off.  My\r\ngoose is all right, praise be!  Missed it by an inch, your lucky shot\r\ndid, sir.'\r\n\r\n'My shot?  I didn't fire.'\r\n\r\n'I 'm sure I beg your pardon, and won't say no more about it, though I\r\n'd a notion you fired at Trousers and missed.  This 'ere scratch won't\r\nspoil my beauty sleep, anyway. Mr. Hoole, sir?  He got off like a bird,\r\nnot but what they didn't have a go at him; the Raider, sir--most\r\nunfortunate, she come up just as we was getting ready for the kick-off,\r\nas you may say.  The old wreck's blown to blazes, but no more harm done,\r\nand I lay Mr. Hoole by this time have got somewhere, though where that\r\nmay be remains to be seen.'\r\n\r\n'Thankful I am as you 're not killed, Mr. Grinson,' said Meek, who had\r\ncome up from behind.\r\n\r\n'Same to you, Ephraim, me lad.  The only fly in my gizzard is that\r\nTrousers has got off; but we 'll dust him yet, Ephraim.  No, I don't\r\nwant no help; I 'm sound on my pins, and my arm don't hurt so bad as\r\nvaccination. What I _would_ like is a pint o' beer, but I might as well\r\ncry for the moon.  Things is a great puzzle, Ephraim!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                             THE AVALANCHE\r\n\r\n\r\n'What I'd like to know, sir,' said Grinson, as they re-entered the\r\nenclosure, 'what I 'd like to know is, why them Germans, Trousers and\r\nthe rest, took it into their heads to try this little game when our\r\nbacks was turned, meaning Mr. Hoole and me?'\r\n\r\n'You think they wouldn't have tried it if they hadn't known you were\r\naway?' said Trentham, checking a smile.\r\n\r\n'Well, sir, two 's two; you can't get over that.  If the whole crew had\r\ncome, 't 'ud 'a been different; but with the Raider away, Trousers\r\nhadn't got enough men for the job, unless he knew we were short-handed,\r\nand I don't see nohow he could have known that.'\r\n\r\n'They must be desperately in want of coal, one would think.  Or perhaps\r\nHahn wanted to distinguish himself in the absence of his commander.  It\r\nwould have been a good stroke to recover the slaves, you know.'\r\n\r\n'That's it, sir,' cried Grinson, slapping his thigh.  'Likewise and\r\nmoreover he was riled with Ephraim what defied him, and so he folds his\r\narms and scowls under his eyebrows and hisses through his clenched\r\nteeth, \"I will have my revenge.\"  I 've seed that on the stage many a\r\ntime.'\r\n\r\n'We 'll grant that Hahn is a villain; but I fancy they had a very\r\npractical object in making this raid.  Perhaps they 've been unlucky on\r\nthe sea lately, must have coal, and would rather get the natives to dig\r\nit than dig it themselves.  In that case we may expect another attack.\r\nHow far was the Raider away when you last saw her?'\r\n\r\n'From fifteen to twenty sea-mile, sir. She 's back in harbour by this, I\r\nreckon.'\r\n\r\n'Then I think we had better reconnoitre. I 'll have a word with Flanso;\r\nnow that his ceremony is over, he 'll probably be able to attend to\r\nbusiness.  Be ready to come with me.'\r\n\r\nThe chief was at first disposed to regard the recent victory as\r\ndecisive; but Trentham managed to convince him that a still more serious\r\nattack might have to be met, and induced him to take the needful\r\nmeasures of defence.  It was arranged that at the first sign of danger\r\nthe whole population of the village should be withdrawn into the inner\r\nenclosure, where they would have the protection of the wall.  The object\r\nof the defence must be to hold the wall until help came. There was a\r\npossibility, of course, that Hoole might not succeed in his mission.\r\nThe engine might fail; even if he reached a port there might be no force\r\navailable for hunting the Raider.  Trentham was not blind to the\r\ndifficulties of the position; but it was essential to keep up a show of\r\nconfidence, and to take all possible steps to hold the ground.\r\n\r\nLess than an hour after Flanso's return Trentham set off with Grinson\r\nand half a dozen natives, among whom was Lafoa, for the cove.  They\r\nmarched cautiously, in case any of Hahn's party were still lingering in\r\nthe forest; but the Germans had evidently been daunted and had returned\r\nto their base.\r\n\r\nTrentham had decided to make for the spot where he had organised Meek's\r\nrelease. While affording a good post of observation, it was difficult of\r\naccess from the beach, and even if discovered by the enemy he would have\r\nplenty of time to escape into the forest behind.  He gave a wide berth\r\nto the sentry-box above the cove, crept round through almost\r\nimpenetrable thickets, and had nearly reached the slope strewn with\r\nboulders when there came faintly on his ear the characteristic rattle of\r\na donkey-engine.\r\n\r\n'The Raider 's back in the cove, Grinson,' he said.\r\n\r\n'Ay, ay, sir, and hoisting coal, seemingly.'\r\n\r\nBidding Grinson keep the natives under cover near the head of the slope,\r\nTrentham stole forward, dodging among the boulders, until he reached a\r\npoint where he could peep over at the cove beneath without much risk of\r\nbeing detected.  The Raider was anchored almost in the same position as\r\nwhen he had last seen her; smoke was pouring from her funnel.  There was\r\nmuch activity both on deck and on the shore.  The donkey-engine was\r\nlifting, not coal, but stores from the ship's boats lying under her\r\nside.  Men were carrying boxes and bales from the shed to the shore.\r\nEverybody was moving with an air of bustle and haste.  It was impossible\r\nto doubt that the vessel was about to leave the cove: the settlement was\r\nto be abandoned.\r\n\r\nAn hour or two earlier Trentham would have rejoiced to know that the\r\nRaider was departing.  But at this moment he felt only annoyance,\r\ndisappointment, positive anger. Within a few short hours Hoole, unless\r\nbaulked by ill-luck, would guide a British vessel to the cove, and the\r\nRaider would meet a well-deserved fate.  It seemed that the Germans had\r\ntaken alarm on seeing their seaplane flying eastwards, obviously under\r\nother than German control.  They had suspected the nature of its\r\nmission, and having a wholesome dread of what might befall them, had\r\ndetermined to forestall the inevitable.  With all his heart Trentham\r\nwished that he could hold the vessel at her anchorage.  But he could do\r\nnothing to interfere with the bustling preparations below. The Raider\r\nwas getting up steam; the stores were being methodically hoisted and\r\nstowed; before very long the vessel would disappear round the horn of\r\nthe cove, and he could only watch her impotently.\r\n\r\n'Flanso's people won't be bothered any more; that's one good thing,' he\r\nthought, as he began to climb up the slope.  Picking his way, he\r\nstumbled, and clutched at one of the boulders to maintain his footing.\r\nThe rock swayed slightly.  Trentham stood still for a moment, resting\r\nhis hand on it.  An observer would have noticed that his brow suddenly\r\ncleared, his eyes danced, a flush spread over his cheeks.  Then with\r\nquick movements, yet careful to keep under cover, he clambered up and\r\nrejoined Grinson.  There was a brief, rapid conversation between them.\r\nGrinson's broad face expressed in turn surprise, doubt, determination,\r\nglee.  Lafoa was given an order.  Then, while Trentham directed them\r\nfrom the cover of the trees, the others quickly rolled a number of the\r\nlargest boulders to a part of the slope which, as nearly as he could\r\ngauge the position, was directly above the Raider.  It was no easy\r\nmatter to move unseen from the sheds.  Some of the most promising of the\r\nboulders had to be neglected. But the noise below was great enough to\r\nsmother the sounds of the men's swift movements, and they were not\r\ninterrupted. Presently, over a space of more than a hundred yards, there\r\nwere ranged in three orderly rows, each row being about twenty paces\r\nfrom the next, a collection of rocks of all shapes and sizes and\r\nweights, from knobs of a few pounds to boulders so heavy as to need the\r\nunited efforts of several men to move them.  One of these, indeed,\r\nalmost escaped from the grasp of the three men handling it, and Trentham\r\nfelt a cold thrill at the imminence of a premature descent.  But\r\nGrinson's brawny arms arrested the monster in the nick of time, and he\r\nsecured it temporarily by means of smaller rocks wedged between it and\r\nthe earth.  Blowing hard, he came to Trentham's side.\r\n\r\n'\"Shust in time!\" as old Trousers would say, sir,' he remarked.  'All's\r\nready, but I won't answer for what 'll happen when you say \"go.\"'\r\n\r\n'We must do our best and trust to luck.'\r\n\r\n'That's not my meaning, sir.  It's these 'ere ugly mugs.  They 've had\r\nno drill, d' ye see.  Might as well be horse marines, in a manner of\r\nspeaking.'\r\n\r\n'Not so bad as that, Grinson.  They have done very well, so far.  Lafoa\r\nseems to understand what is needed, and if you set them a good example,\r\nI dare say they 'll follow it. The Germans seem to have cleared up\r\nnearly everything, and we had better start operations.  I 'll climb down\r\nto the left yonder, where I 'll be out of the way, but can observe\r\nresults without being seen myself.  I 'll give the signal by lifting my\r\nhand; the rest is with you and the natives.'\r\n\r\n'Ay, ay, sir.  It 'll be a bit of a \"tamasha,\" as they say out east.'\r\n\r\nTrentham clambered down the slope under cover of the boulders, until he\r\ngained the spot he had pointed out.  Grinson and the natives posted\r\nthemselves at equal intervals behind the first row of the displaced\r\nboulders.  A boat filled with boxes of ammunition was putting off from\r\nthe shore.  All of the crew who were not already on board the vessel\r\nwere moving down from the sheds; apparently their work was finished.\r\nTrentham gazed seawards; there was no sign of the seaplane or of any\r\nship.  He raised his hand. Grinson instantly gave a mighty shove to the\r\nhuge boulder behind which he was standing, and it began to bump down the\r\nslope.  The natives were not quite so prompt, but after only a few\r\nseconds' delay five other boulders of smaller bulk started forward.\r\nFour reached the brink almost together, the fifth rolled a few yards,\r\nthen stopped.  But a few moments later there were five resounding\r\nsplashes in quick succession as the rocks plunged into the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRINSON GAVE THE BOULDER A SHOVE IN THE DESIRED\r\nDIRECTION.]\r\n\r\nEagerly watching the result of his scheme, Trentham was disappointed to\r\nsee that the missiles had fallen short of the Raider.  But all work on\r\nthe vessel ceased; a bale of goods that was being hoisted by the\r\ndonkey-engine stopped half-way; the men on board gazed in surprise up\r\nthe cliff, those in the boat stopped pulling.  The angle of the slope\r\nwas such that the men above were invisible; there was nothing to show\r\nthat the fall of the boulders was not accidental.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, Grinson and his party had run up to the second row,\r\nand while the Germans were discussing the phenomenon another shower\r\ntumbled over the edge, one of the boulders falling plump on the bridge\r\nof the vessel, knocking away a portion of the rail, missing the captain\r\nby a foot or two, and crashing through the window of his cabin. Two went\r\nclean over the ship; the other two fell a little short of the port side,\r\nand threw a great volume of water into the half-empty boat.  After a\r\nbrief interval another set of boulders followed, and then another, until\r\nthe missiles fell in a continuous shower.  The captain roared an order;\r\nthe grinding of the anchor chain was heard, and the men on shore,\r\ncarrying rifles, rushed up the beach towards the winding path that led\r\nup the cliffs.\r\n\r\nTrentham began to feel anxious.  Very little damage had yet been done;\r\nthe boulders varied greatly in shape and weight, and their trajectory\r\nafter leaving the edge was equally various.  Some rolled sideways; one,\r\nindeed, took an extraordinary tortuous course to the right, and struck\r\nthe roof of the nearest hut, which was shivered into fragments.  Those\r\nthat had fallen nearest to the vessel were the larger rocks from the\r\nsecond row, and Trentham signalled to Grinson to deal with those\r\nremaining.  He felt that the sands were running out; but there were\r\nstill a few minutes before the Germans rushing up the steep and\r\nroundabout path could reach the head of the slope.\r\n\r\n'A little more to the left!' he shouted to Grinson, realising that\r\nnothing was now to be gained by silence.\r\n\r\n'Ay, ay, sir!' roared the seaman, shoving a knobby rock in the desired\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nTrentham held his breath as he watched its flight.  Before he was\r\nprepared for it there was a thunderous crash; the boulder had struck the\r\nside of the vessel a few feet below the rail, within twenty feet of the\r\nbows, passing clean through the plates, and leaving a huge rent.  Almost\r\nimmediately afterwards another boulder crashed through the deck slightly\r\nabaft the funnel.  There was an instant rush of steam; apparently it had\r\nsmashed through one of the boilers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WITH A THUNDEROUS CRASH IT STRUCK THE SIDE OF THE VESSEL\r\nA FEW FEET BELOW THE RAIL.]\r\n\r\nAmong the crew surprise had become consternation, and now developed into\r\npanic. Men rushed from below and sprang overboard.  Others were running\r\nwildly about the deck.  The captain had gone forward with one of his\r\nofficers to see the extent of the damage there.  Water was pouring\r\nthrough the side.  Trentham, judging that the vessel was at any rate\r\ndisabled, and that it was time to be gone, turned to climb up the slope,\r\nand wriggled hastily aside to avoid a boulder which had swerved in its\r\ncourse and was hurtling in his direction.  He stopped to throw a last\r\nglimpse below; the boulder which he had so narrowly escaped carried away\r\nthe donkey-engine, and ricochetted from the deck into the sea.\r\n\r\n'Well done!' he cried, and ran to assist Grinson to topple over one of\r\nthe large rocks which had supported the rope on the night of Meek's\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\n'That's riddled 'em!' shouted Grinson, as the noise of shattered metal\r\nrose from below.\r\n\r\n'She can't get away!' panted Trentham. 'They 're coming up the cliff; we\r\nmust run for it.'\r\n\r\nCollecting the men, he dashed up the few remaining yards of the slope\r\nand headed them into the forest just as a German seaman came in sight\r\nnear the end of the ledge.\r\n\r\n'\"Shust in time!\" Trousers, my son,' chuckled Grinson.  'We give her a\r\ngood battering, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Cut open her side, broke a boiler, and drowned the donkey-engine.  What\r\nmore I don't know; but she 's crippled.'\r\n\r\n'My cripes!  What a tale to tell my Ephraim!  I only wish the lad could\r\n'a seen it hisself.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                            AT ARM'S LENGTH\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the mazes of the forest the little party had no fear of pursuit,\r\nand they marched rapidly homeward with the alacrity of men conscious of\r\nsuccess. They had gone only a few miles when Trentham heard the\r\nunmistakable purring of the seaplane's engine.  At that spot the trees\r\nformed a canopy overhead through which the sky could scarcely be seen;\r\nbut at his bidding Lafoa ordered one of the natives to climb a lofty\r\ntrunk and discover if possible in what direction the machine was flying.\r\nThe sound had long been inaudible when the man came to the ground again\r\nand reported that the strange bird had not soared within sight.\r\n\r\nThey pushed oh, and were met some little distance from the village by\r\nHoole himself.\r\n\r\n'Been scalp-hunting?' he said with a smile.\r\n\r\n'No; playing bowls.  But what's your news?' asked Trentham.  'Ours will\r\nkeep.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I guess it might be worse.  I made Wilhelmshafen, and had to run\r\nthe gauntlet of a score or so of rifles.  It seems they 'd heard a thing\r\nor two about the seaplane, and had already reported to one of your\r\nwarships that's cruising somewhere east.  I didn't dare land till I 'd\r\ndropped a note telling 'em who I was.  There's no warship within miles;\r\nbut as soon as they had heard my story they rose to the occasion; they\r\n're some sports.  The only vessel they had around was a tramp; she might\r\nmake ten knots in the ordinary way, but could be speeded up to twelve,\r\nperhaps, by frantic stoking; so the engineer said.  The skipper started\r\ncoaling at once; he had her cleared of everything that could be spared,\r\nand the crew volunteered to a man.'\r\n\r\n'But, my dear fellow, a tramp!  She 'd no more offensive weapon, I\r\nsuppose, than a hose.'\r\n\r\n'That's correct; but, of course, the skipper had no notion of fighting\r\nthe Raider. His idea was to steal up along the coast and lie doggo while\r\nhis men came across country and got you away.  At the same time he did\r\nwhat was possible by way of armament. There was a number of machine-guns\r\non shore, left by the Germans when they hauled down their flag to the\r\nAustralians.  He put them aboard, and some Australian gunners were keen\r\nto join in this stunt, along with a crowd of young fellows who swore\r\nthey were all crack shots, and a trader or two. Altogether there are\r\nbetween thirty and forty men coming along.  She wasn't ready, of course,\r\nwhen I left; but with good luck she 'll lie off the shore eastward by\r\nsunrise to-morrow. Stealing up through the night she 's a good chance of\r\nescaping notice, and unless the Raider makes an early morning trip you\r\n'll get away without trouble.  Of course, if she is spotted--well, we\r\nknow what the Raider's guns can do.'\r\n\r\n'The tramp has only to keep out of range; the Raider 's crippled.'\r\n\r\n'You don't say!  Did she run aground?'\r\n\r\nTrentham related the morning's events.\r\n\r\n'Bully!' cried Hoole.  'Say, what's to prevent our making a good bag of\r\nGermans? You think the Raider will sink?'\r\n\r\n'There can't be much question of that. They had carried most of their\r\narms on board, and probably those went down with the vessel; the men\r\nwould waste their time trying to save her.  But there were some armed\r\nmen still on shore, and they might rescue a certain number of rifles\r\nbefore the ship went down.  As I came along I tried to decide what I 'd\r\ndo myself in the Germans' place. They are marooned; they must guess that\r\nyou flew off for help, and expect to have to deal with some sort of\r\nforce.  The question is, will they surrender or fight?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I don't know the inside of a German's mind, so I can't say; but I\r\nknow what I 'd do.  I wouldn't surrender without a fight; and if I saw\r\nthe odds against me, I 'd make tracks inland, live on the country, and\r\nhold out.  The Germans are so cocksure of winning the war that I guess\r\nthey 'll do that.'\r\n\r\n'I came to the same conclusion.  It's not as if they were traders; they\r\n're naval men, and I can't imagine their giving in tamely.  Well, then,\r\nwe shall have to prepare for a fight.'\r\n\r\n'How do you mean?\r\n\r\n'They 've lost the greater part of their provisions, and will have to\r\nreplace them. What better chance than to quarter themselves by main\r\nforce on the nearest village, which is our friend Flanso's, and compel\r\nthe people to provide for them?  Incidentally also take vengeance for\r\nthe smashing of their vessel.  We can't leave Flanso in the lurch.'\r\n\r\n'I guess you 're right.  Some of those young fellows at Wilhelmshafen\r\nwere spoiling for a fight, and were real disgruntled when the skipper\r\nshowed 'em they 'd have no chance against a well-armed raider.  They 'll\r\nbe ready enough to take a hand in beating off the Germans if they attack\r\nthe village.'\r\n\r\n'If they arrive in time.  We may have to face the music before they get\r\nhere, and I don't much like the prospect.  Thanks to Grinson, we did\r\nvery well against Hahn's handful this morning, but it will be quite\r\nanother thing to deal with fifty or sixty, perhaps more, a good\r\nproportion armed with rifles.  Your revolver ammunition is all spent; we\r\n've got the revolvers of the two prisoners, that's all.'\r\n\r\n'I brought three revolvers along and a few rounds of cartridges; very\r\nlittle good they 'll be against two or three score rifles.  We 'll be\r\nback of the wall, of course, which is something to the good.'\r\n\r\n'By the way, we heard your seaplane. Where is it?'\r\n\r\n'Away yonder.  I came down on that pond the Germans failed to strike.  I\r\nguess they heard her too, and may waste time trying to find her, which\r\nwill give us a chance to set our defences in order.  Say, shall we get\r\nalong?'\r\n\r\nThey hurried on.  The natives of their party had preceded them, and were\r\nsurrounded by groups of excited villagers to whom they were expounding\r\nthe method by which the white men had destroyed the enemy's vessel.  A\r\nnoisy throng followed Trentham and his friends to the gate of the inner\r\nenclosure, and when they had disappeared, started a victory dance up and\r\ndown the broad path.\r\n\r\nLafoa's aid was once more enlisted by Trentham in explaining the\r\nsituation to the chief.  More intelligent than his subjects outside,\r\nFlanso was under no illusion about the danger that threatened his\r\nvillage.  His own experiences while in the hands of the Germans left him\r\nin no doubt as to the fate in store for his people if the enemy got the\r\nbetter of them, and he was ready to accept Trentham's suggestion that\r\nall but the fighting men should be at once sent away southward into the\r\nforest, where they would be at least out of harm's way until the issue\r\nwas determined.  But when he consulted some of his counsellors he at\r\nonce encountered the strenuous opposition of the medicine-man, who had\r\nnot forgiven Hoole for having made him cut so sorry a figure at the\r\nduk-duk dance. He protested that the new danger threatening the village\r\nwas due to the stupidity of the white men.  Why had they destroyed the\r\nblue vessel, and prevented the enemy from going away?  They were already\r\nresponsible for the destruction of the wreck that had been preserved and\r\ncherished by the chief's forefathers from the beginning of the world.\r\nThey had prevented the human sacrifice customary at the inauguration of\r\na new chief.  They were meddlers, and all the misfortunes that had\r\nbefallen the village were due to them.\r\n\r\nSuch was the gist of the medicine-man's harangue, though these few\r\nsentences by no means represent the torrent of words which poured from\r\nhis lips.  Nor could any one but a cinematograph operator properly\r\ndepict the extraordinary grimaces of his features and the violent\r\ngestures with which he emphasised his denunciations.  His right hand\r\nwielded a heavy nail-studded mace, and as his excitement grew he\r\nstepped, or rather danced, nearer to the group of white men, twirling\r\nthe mace, tossing it in the air, striking the ground with it.  Ignorant\r\nthough they were of his language, the white men could not mistake the\r\npurport of his speech, and two of them noticed with some anxiety that he\r\nwas making an impression on some members of his native audience.\r\nGrinson, however, felt nothing but amusement.  A broad grin spread over\r\nhis face as he listened and watched, and the more excited the\r\nmedicine-man became the more pleasure the seaman took in the\r\nperformance, giving utterance now and then to his sentiments with sundry\r\nejaculations and cat-calls.\r\n\r\nAt last a sudden change came over his expression.  The medicine-man in\r\nhis frenzy had drawn very near to Hoole, and to give point to one of his\r\nstatements he thrust his mace forward at the full length of his arm, so\r\nthat Hoole only escaped a blow by stepping quickly back.  It was\r\nuncertain whether the man had intended to attack him, but the suspicion\r\nwas too much for Grinson.  His lips snapped together; with a great roar\r\nhe hurled himself at the orator, struck the mace from his hand, and\r\ncaught him round the waist and hoisted him above his head.  The sinews\r\nof the seaman's arms cracked; for some seconds he held the native aloft,\r\nas if hesitating whether to cast him to the ground. Terrified into\r\nsilence, the man wriggled; the spectators looked on open-mouthed.\r\nGrinson grew purple with exertion; then he laughed.  Gradually he\r\nlowered his arms, stretched to full length, and gently laid the man at\r\nHoole's feet.\r\n\r\n'Windbag!' he muttered, passing his hand across his sweating brow, then\r\nsetting his arms akimbo and looking down at the still figure.\r\n\r\nGasps of amazement broke from the natives.  The medicine-man lay for\r\nhalf a minute; when Grinson stooped and picked up the fallen mace he\r\nclosed his eyes as if expecting a blow.\r\n\r\n'A very neat little bobby's bludgeon, sir,' said Grinson, sticking the\r\nmace under his arm. 'Move on, there!'\r\n\r\nThe medicine-man opened his eyes, and seeing that Grinson had turned\r\naside he crawled slowly away, rose to his feet, and sidled into his hut.\r\n\r\nThe colloquy he had interrupted was resumed.  So great was the\r\nimpression made by Grinson's display of strength that the natives were\r\nready to agree to anything the white men proposed.  It was arranged that\r\nthe non-combatants should be sent away; a number of huts and trees near\r\nthe wall on the outside should be razed, provisions brought into the\r\ninner enclosure.  A few weak spots in the wall were strengthened, and by\r\nnightfall everything that was possible had been done to prepare for\r\nattack.  Scouts meanwhile had been sent out in the direction from which\r\nattack might be expected.  These were withdrawn as soon as it became\r\ndark, and the whole able-bodied population was brought within the wall.\r\n\r\nTrentham recognised the futility of attempting any definite tactical\r\nmeasures with a rabble of undisciplined natives.\r\n\r\n'They must fight in their own way, if there is to be a fight,' he said\r\nto Hoole.  'Let alone the impossibility of giving orders with only one\r\ninterpreter, we should only worry them by trying to lick them into\r\nshape.  We must rely on their common sense.'\r\n\r\n'Just so.  It's up to them to keep the enemy out, and that's all that\r\nmatters.  A word as to not exposing themselves--that's all we can do,\r\nexcept set 'em a good example.'\r\n\r\n'As to that, you 'd be useful here, old man; but I fancy you 'd be even\r\nmore useful if you went off in the seaplane and guided the steamer into\r\nthe cove.  With the Raider sunk, she could quite well run in and land\r\nher crew on the Germans' beach; they 'd get here quicker then than if\r\nthey landed at a spot we don't know the way from.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I guess we 'll wait and see,' said Hoole.  'We 'll take turns to\r\ndo sentry-go through the night.  If nothing happens, I 'll very likely\r\ntake a run out in the morning. The tramp won't be far away then,\r\nanyhow.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n                             THE LAST RAID\r\n\r\n\r\n'Ephraim, have you made your will, me lad?' asked Grinson, sitting in\r\nthe hut with Meek in the early hours of the morning.\r\n\r\n'Never did I think of such a thing, Mr. Grinson,' replied Meek.  ''Tis\r\nonly lords and skippers as make wills.'\r\n\r\n'That 's where you 're wrong, me lad. Specially now.  For why?  'Cos\r\n'tis the dooty of every man to make his will afore going into action.'\r\n\r\n'S'pose he ain't got nothing to leave, and no widders nor orphans to\r\npurvide for?'\r\n\r\n'It don't make no difference.  Besides, every man's got something.  Lord\r\nAdmiral Nelson, as you 've heard of, had a glass eye, and 'tis said he\r\nleft it to his footman, as he once caught nicking, to remind him that\r\nthere 's always an Eye beholding of the evil and the good, besides his\r\nheart to the country.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I never!'\r\n\r\n'Not but what there 's a mighty big risk in making your will.  There was\r\nonce a chap I knowed as made his will and died next day--fell off a\r\nladder, he did, and his mates said he might 'a been alive to this day\r\nonly for the will.  Likewise a skipper I once sailed with left his craft\r\nto be sold and divided among the crew; uncommon skipper he was; and she\r\nwent down next voyage, and not insured. Ah! 'tis a solemn thought,\r\nmaking your will.'\r\n\r\n'What put making wills and such into your head just now, Mr. Grinson?'\r\n\r\n'Well, it's like this.  The gentlemen expects what you may call a battle\r\nroyal afore the day 's out, and you 've got to look at it sensible.  We\r\ncome all right out o' that scrap yesterday, but 'twas only Trousers and\r\na few more, and we took 'em by surprise, d' ye see? Things will be\r\ndifferent if all them Germans come up together; the odds ain't even,\r\nEphraim.'\r\n\r\n'True.  I can bear ye out in that, Mr. Grinson. I don't hold with\r\nfighting--not with guns.'\r\n\r\n'No more do I, 'cos I never shot a gun in my life.  But this 'ere\r\ntruncheon of old ugly mug's is as good as a gun, if it gets a chance;\r\nwhich I mean to say firing off guns ain't fighting at all, to my way of\r\nthinking. Darbies or sticks--that 's all right; the best man wins; but\r\nwith guns--why, any little mean feller as would give you best if you\r\nlooked at him may do you in from a distance, hiding behind a haystack,\r\np'r'aps, or up a tree.  No, Ephraim, that ain't fighting, not by a long\r\nchalk.'\r\n\r\n'And have you made your own will, Mr. Grinson?'\r\n\r\n'No, I ain't, and I 'm sorry for you, me lad, for I meant to leave you\r\nmy old parrot as sits on his perch in Mother Perkins's parlour.  You\r\nremember Mother Perkins, what said she 'd be glad to mind the bird, 'cos\r\nhis language was so beautiful and reminded her of me?'\r\n\r\n'Ah!  I wish I could speak like you, Mr. Grinson, but there--I never\r\ncould do it, not if I tried ever so.  But you don't think you 're going\r\nto be killed?'\r\n\r\n'Well, you see, I 'm twice as broad as you, and so the chances is\r\nagainst me, with guns. It's only fair, after all, 'cos in a real fight I\r\ncould take on two, p'r'aps more; I should say more, with this 'ere\r\ntruncheon.  I ain't got no presentiments, Ephraim; but what is to be is,\r\nand in case they knock a hole in me I do hereby declare and pronounce as\r\nmy old parrot is to belong to you and no one else, and so you 'll tell\r\nMother Perkins.'\r\n\r\n'I don't like to think of it, Mr. Grinson, but if so be as you 're\r\nkilled and I ain't, I 'll look after that bird as if 'twas you, and\r\nthink of you whenever it speaks.'\r\n\r\n'Only if it speaks decent, Ephraim.  I won't deny it picked up a few\r\nunholy words afore I bought it, and they come out sometimes; you can't\r\nhelp it.'\r\n\r\nThe seamen, though they had recently returned from sentry-go, were\r\nwakeful, and talked on till morning, exchanging reminiscences of their\r\nyears of comradeship.  At sunrise they joined Trentham and Hoole, and\r\nwere allotted posts within the walls, if the Germans should attack.\r\nScouts had already been sent out into the forest, to keep watch in the\r\ndirection from which the enemy was likely to come.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the position had been thoroughly discussed between\r\nTrentham and Hoole.  The latter, though reluctant to leave his friend to\r\nbear the brunt of any fighting that might take place, at last agreed\r\nthat probably the best service that he could render was to hasten the\r\narrival of the steamer. About nine o'clock he set off with two natives\r\nfor the lake where he had left the seaplane. Little more than two hours\r\nlater Trentham heard the hum of the engine.  The seaplane passed over\r\nthe village, going eastward and skimming the tree-tops.  From the signs\r\nmade by Hoole, Trentham understood that the Germans were on their way,\r\nand this preliminary intimation was confirmed soon after noon, when the\r\nscouts came running in.  Their report that a great host of the bad men\r\nwas approaching aroused great excitement among the natives, who, proud\r\nof their easy victory on the previous day, showed little sign of\r\nunderstanding the nature of the ordeal they were to pass through.  Some\r\nof them were for sallying out and meeting the Germans in the forest; but\r\nFlanso had intelligence enough to perceive the danger of breaking up his\r\nforce, and at Trentham's suggestion he concentrated the greater number\r\nof his men near the gate, where the enemy's main attack was likely to be\r\nmade. A few were stationed at other points along the circuit of the\r\nwall, to give notice if surprise attacks were attempted elsewhere than\r\nin front.\r\n\r\nTrentham had persuaded the chief to place under Grinson's command about\r\na score of the men whom he had led on the day before. His leadership\r\nthen, and his subsequent display of muscular strength in dealing with\r\nthe medicine-man, had won their admiration; and the fact that he bore\r\ntheir totem mark on his shoulder was a great factor in inspiring them\r\nwith confidence.  Even without Lafoa's assistance Grinson seemed to be\r\nable to make them understand his wishes.\r\n\r\n'You had better hold your men in reserve, Grinson,' said Trentham.  'Put\r\nthem in a central position--about the chief's house, say; and keep them\r\nout of the fight until they can come in with decisive effect.'\r\n\r\n'For the knock-out, as you may say, sir,' Grinson replied.  'I\r\nunderstand.  But begging your pardon, I ain't to remain in a state of\r\nabsolution if I see a chance--you don't mean that, sir?'\r\n\r\n'Not at all,' answered Trentham, who was by this time able to understand\r\nthe seaman's sometimes recondite phraseology.  'All I mean is that I\r\ndon't want you to take part in every scrimmage, but only when you see\r\nthe rest of us hard pressed.  Where 's your revolver, by the way?'\r\n\r\n'I give it to Ephraim, sir.'\r\n\r\n'But he had one; we have five altogether now.'\r\n\r\n'True, sir; but the long and short is that I feel much more at home with\r\nthis 'ere truncheon or knuckle-duster.  With the pistol I might miss,\r\nnot being used to such things; but with this'--he lifted it, eyeing it\r\nwith affection--'with this I can be sure, by the feel.'\r\n\r\n'Is Meek a good shot?'\r\n\r\n'He couldn't hit a hay-stack, sir; but, talking between our two selves,\r\nwe thought Ephraim was the man to keep his eye on you and be ready to\r\ngive you another pistol when the fust is empty.  I don't mind saying\r\n'twas my idea, 'cos Ephraim ain't quite hisself yet arter that night on\r\nthe ledge, only he 's got such a spirit that nothing would 'a kept him\r\nout of it if so be he didn't believe he was more useful otherways, and\r\nhe believes that now, though I won't answer for how long it will last.'\r\n\r\nThe simple dispositions that were alone possible had barely been made\r\nwhen Trentham, looking out over the wall beside the gate, saw a man\r\nbearing a white flag advancing unaccompanied along the broad central\r\npath through the village.  In a few seconds he recognised the square,\r\nsolid face of Hahn. The German, who appeared to be unarmed, halted\r\nbeyond range of revolver shots, and waving his flag, shouted:\r\n\r\n'Hi, hi!  Somevon speak.'\r\n\r\n'What do you want, Hahn?' Trentham called.\r\n\r\n'I speak for Captain Holzbach, of ze Imperial German Navy,' said Hahn.\r\n'Ze captain bresent his gompliments and say zat he admire very much ze\r\nclever vay his ship is sunk, and zink ze vite men shall now be friendly,\r\nbecause we must all remain on zis island until ze var end.  He vish to\r\nbuy food, and say if ze savages come out and sell, he pay good price,\r\nand zey shall be safe.'\r\n\r\nTrentham was under no illusion as to the German's good will; but wishing\r\nto temporise, partly with a view to the avoidance of further fighting,\r\npartly to allow for the arrival of the expected help, he replied:\r\n\r\n'On behalf of the chief of this village I am willing to strike a\r\nbargain.  If you, Hahn, and three other officers will come inside,\r\nunarmed, as hostages, a sufficient supply of provisions shall be sent\r\nout to you, on condition that you leave this part of the country, and\r\nengage not to molest the people.'\r\n\r\nWhatever Hahn may have expected, it was clear that he was surprised at\r\nthe terms offered.  After a slight hesitation he said:\r\n\r\n'It is not right zat German officers shall place zemselves in ze hands\r\nof savages, vat eat men.'\r\n\r\n'But I am not a savage, and I guarantee that you shall not be eaten.\r\nYou have good reason for being sure of that, Hahn.'\r\n\r\nThe German appeared to be annoyed at the allusion to his rescue from the\r\ndancing party on the beach.\r\n\r\n'It is absurd!' he cried.  'Ze dignity of German officers vill not\r\npermit zem to do vat you say.'\r\n\r\n'Then I am afraid that you must repeat to your captain that we cannot\r\ntrade with him.'\r\n\r\n'You know vat you do?  Of us zere are fifty or sixty, viz rifles.  You\r\nzink savages viz spears any good?  Ve are not hard; but if it is var,\r\nzen----'\r\n\r\n'Threats are useless, Hahn,' Trentham interrupted.  'We know your idea\r\nof war.  I have nothing more to say.  You have my terms: you had better\r\nconsult your superior officer.'\r\n\r\nThe German glared, turned on his heel, and walked away.  The breathless\r\nsilence which had held the natives during the colloquy was broken by\r\nshouts of triumph; but Trentham sent Lafoa to explain matters to the\r\nchief, and asked him to keep his men in readiness for the assault which\r\ncould not long be delayed.  It was clear to him that Hahn's mission had\r\nbeen intended to lead to the opening of the gate and the division of the\r\ngarrison.  He had no doubt that if the natives had been decoyed outside\r\ntheir wall, the Germans would have rushed the place.\r\n\r\nFor some time after Hahn's departure there was no sign of hostilities.\r\nThen the Germans could be heard shouting to one another in the forest\r\nnorth of the village, and with the voices mingled the sound of\r\nwood-cutting.  None of the enemy came in sight, and Trentham could only\r\nconjecture the nature of their operations.\r\n\r\nNearly two hours passed.  The natives grew more and more noisy and\r\nrestless. They could not understand why they were still cooped up in the\r\nenclosure.  At length, however, after a brief cessation of all sounds in\r\nthe forest, there was a sudden whistle, followed by the sharp crack of\r\nrifles, and from the trees facing the northern side of the village the\r\nGermans rushed forward in open order, on a front of nearly a quarter of\r\na mile. The defenders, as Trentham had ordered, remained out of sight.\r\nHe himself watched the enemy through a loophole in the log wall.\r\n\r\nThey were variously armed.  Some had rifles with bayonets; others\r\ncutlasses, others axes.  Some carried roughly constructed ladders.  As\r\nthey drew nearer, Trentham noticed that these last, as well as the\r\nofficers at different parts of the line, were armed with rifles.  They\r\ncame on steadily and silently until they were almost within effective\r\nbow-shot; then they halted, the officers collected and consulted\r\ntogether.  It appeared that they were somewhat at a loss how to proceed\r\nagainst an enemy whom they could not see, and whose defences they had no\r\nmeans of battering down.  The pause was of short duration.  Another\r\nvolley was fired, with the intention doubtless of overawing the natives\r\nrather than of doing effective damage. A few men behind the walls were\r\nslightly injured by splinters; none were incapacitated, and all, with a\r\nself-restraint that Trentham had not expected, remained quietly at their\r\nposts until the enemy should come to close quarters.\r\n\r\nAfter discharging their rifles, the Germans surged forward again, moving\r\nvery rapidly, but maintaining a regular line.  Trentham wondered why\r\nthey were spread out so widely instead of concentrating on a limited\r\nsection of the wall.  In a few moments he saw through their plan.  It\r\nhad been desired to weaken the defence by compelling the natives to man\r\na longer stretch of the wall than was the actual object of attack.  The\r\nGermans suddenly contracted their front, no doubt calculating to reach\r\nthe wall a few invaluable seconds before the defenders could mass at the\r\nthreatened section.\r\n\r\nThey were now within range of the natives' weapons, and in close order\r\npresented a target which even Grinson, despite his want of skill with\r\nthe spear, could hardly have missed. Obeying a preconcerted signal from\r\nTrentham, Flanso at last gave his panting warriors the word they had\r\neagerly awaited.  They sprang on to the platform that lined the foot of\r\nthe wall, and was just high enough to bring their heads a few inches\r\nabove the top. A shower of arrows and spears burst upon the advancing\r\nenemy.  Many of them fell, but the rush was not stayed.  There was no\r\nanswer from their rifles; their orders evidently were to force their way\r\ninto the defences with cold steel.  Another flight of arrows equally\r\nfailed to check them.  With disciplined energy they swept forward to the\r\nwall, and having reached it were in comparative safety from the weapons\r\nof the men within.  Quickly they set their ladders against the barricade\r\nand began to swarm up with the agility of seamen.  Where there were no\r\nladders they mounted on one another's backs.  They gained the top, and\r\nthen began a furious struggle, so confused that Trentham was never able\r\nto give a clear account of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUICKLY THEY SET THEIR LADDERS AGAINST THE BARRICADE, AND\r\nBEGAN TO SWARM UP.]\r\n\r\nThe Germans had the advantage of discipline, the higher position, and\r\nbetter weapons.  The natives on the other hand, were more numerous, but\r\nlacked cohesion. They plied their spears manfully, but these were a poor\r\ndefence against clubbed rifles, bayonets, swords, revolvers.  Only their\r\nnumbers saved them from utter defeat from the moment when the enemy\r\ngained a footing on the wall.  Trentham ran along the line, making play\r\nwith his revolver wherever the Germans were thickest.  A group of\r\nnatives had attached themselves to him, and when he had disposed of two\r\nor three of the enemy with rapid shots, the Papuans took advantage of\r\nthe Germans' momentary bafflement and with their spears cleared a few\r\nfeet of the wall.\r\n\r\nBut he could not be everywhere at once. While he had been engaged at\r\nthis spot, some fifty yards beyond, the Germans, having beaten off the\r\nnatives who had tried to thrust them from the wall, had jumped down, and\r\nwere pressing forward over the bodies of the fallen towards the centre\r\nof the enclosure. Trentham and Flanso had marked the danger at the same\r\nmoment.  With a resonant shout the latter dashed towards the enemy at\r\nthe head of a body of picked men, and the Germans, outnumbered and\r\nunable to withstand the fury of his onset, fell stubbornly back.\r\nSatisfied that Flanso could hold his own for a time, Trentham dashed on\r\nto another point where half a dozen Germans in line were driving back\r\nwith their bayonets the few survivors of the natives who had been unable\r\nto hold the wall.  At this moment he was somewhat perturbed at hearing\r\nshouts and firing from a distant quarter which he had not known to be\r\nattacked.  He had no time to find out what was happening there, but\r\nhoped that Grinson had been on the alert. On the point of plunging into\r\nthe fray, he found that he had emptied both the revolvers he had brought\r\nwith him.  He snatched up a spear, but as he rose from stooping Meek's\r\ntremulous voice sounded in his ear.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Grinson said I was to bring 'em, sir.'\r\n\r\nThe man thrust two revolvers into his hands, then took the spear and\r\nfollowed him.\r\n\r\nThe natives were falling back before the serried bayonets.  From the\r\nwall behind Germans were leaping one after another as fast as they could\r\nclimb the ladders on the other side.  One of them, pausing on the top,\r\nfired his rifle point-blank at Trentham, but a comrade climbing after\r\nhim jostled him at the critical moment; the shot flew wide, and, unknown\r\nto Trentham, struck Meek, who fell heavily near the foot of the wall.\r\nWith a couple of shots Trentham disposed of the man who had fired at him\r\nand another who had just descended; then he turned to help the natives\r\nwhom the pitiless bayonets were demoralising.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Hahn, with bayonet outstretched, came heavily towards him\r\nfrom the side.  Trentham flashed a shot at him, and as he stumbled past,\r\nhard hit, wrenched the rifle from his grasp and hurried on.  Coming upon\r\nthe Germans from the rear, he shot down one after another; the natives,\r\ncheered by his presence, rallied, and flinging themselves on the\r\nsurvivors, disposed of them with their spears and sent reeling back\r\nothers who had just sprung from the wall.\r\n\r\nBut other Germans were swarming over on each side.  At three or four\r\npoints little groups had found their footing and were more than holding\r\ntheir own, while others, astride on the top, were firing on the\r\ndefenders and strewing the ground with their victims. Trentham saw with\r\nsinking heart that the natives were everywhere giving way and falling\r\nback towards the chief's house.  The Germans on the flank farthest from\r\nhim were beginning to form up in line, with the evident intention of\r\ncarrying all before them in a final charge.  Fully occupied in helping\r\nhis immediate followers to repel a swarm of Germans who were pouring\r\nover the wall in his neighbourhood, Trentham saw the imminence of total\r\ndefeat which he now felt powerless to avert.\r\n\r\nFacing the wall, he suddenly heard, above the general din of the\r\nconflict, the deep bellow of Grinson's war-cry.  He turned quickly and\r\nsaw the seaman, with his sleeves turned up, wielding his huge mace, and\r\nfollowed by a score of yelling natives, charging along at the foot of\r\nthe wall.  Swinging his mighty weapon as easily as if it had been a\r\nwalking-cane, Grinson fell upon the flank of the Germans who were\r\npreparing to charge.  Now he plied the mace in wide sweeps that cleared\r\na path as a sickle through grain; now he gave point with the massive\r\nstudded head; now he swung it over his head like a blacksmith's hammer.\r\nRevolvers were flashed at him, but he hurled himself along unscathed.\r\nThe Germans on the wall dared not fire at him for fear of hitting their\r\nown men.  And Trentham was amazed to see, close behind him, the hideous\r\nfigure of the medicine-man, advancing with grotesque leaps and whirling\r\nhis arms with extraordinary contortions.\r\n\r\nThe enemy huddled together, some still fighting, others merely seeking\r\nto escape from this human battering-ram.  They began to retire in\r\nTrentham's direction; the natives in their front, taking heart, closed\r\nin; and Trentham, feeling that at this critical moment he might leave\r\nthe wall unguarded, led his men to meet the discomfited enemy.  Taken\r\nthus in front and on both flanks, so crowded together that those of them\r\nwho had firearms were unable to use them, the Germans became a\r\ndisorganised mob.  Heedless of the shouts of their officers, of whom one\r\nor two had entered the enclosure, while the others were either on the\r\nwall or outside, they sought safety in flight.  Many of them were cut\r\ndown before they gained the wall.  The rest clambered over, abandoning\r\ntheir weapons that impeded them, and fled helter-skelter into the\r\nforest, pursued by the natives led by Flanso himself.\r\n\r\nGrinson sat down with his mace across his knees, wiped his streaming\r\nbrow, and looked with a sort of amused curiosity at sundry gashes and\r\nstabs on his arm.\r\n\r\n'Might 'a been worse, sir,' he said. 'Would you believe it?  Ugly mug\r\nhas stuck to me like a brother.  Which it proves, if you want a man to\r\nlove you, just knock him down.  But where's my Ephraim, sir? What's\r\nbecome o' the lad?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                                JUSTICE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome twenty minutes after the flight of the Germans two figures appeared\r\nat the farther end of the village, and walked quickly up the central\r\npath.  Trentham, sitting just outside the gate, waved his hand and\r\nstarted to meet them.  Hoole flourished his hat in reply, and turned to\r\nspeak to the man accompanying him.\r\n\r\n'Let me name to you Captain Rolfe, of the _Wanda_, old man,' said Hoole,\r\nwhen Trentham joined them.\r\n\r\n'Pleased to meet you, sir,' said the seaman, clasping Trentham's hand in\r\na crushing grip. 'We 're in at the death, and that's about all we can\r\nsay for ourselves.  You carry off the honours, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Thanks, captain,' said Trentham.  'It was my friend Josiah Grinson who\r\ndealt the finishing stroke; I 'll introduce him to you presently.'\r\n\r\n'The boatswain bold, as they say in the song,' added Hoole.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Hoole has told me about him,' said the captain, 'and I 'll be glad\r\nto give him a berth.'\r\n\r\n'You must take Meek too,' said Trentham with a smile.  'They 've been\r\ntogether twenty-five years or so, and I 'm sure nothing will part them\r\nnow.  At the present moment Grinson is acting as nurse.  Meek was\r\nunlucky enough to get hit; not seriously, I 'm glad to say; but he\r\nwasn't in very good condition, and appears to have fainted from loss of\r\nblood.  Grinson found him on the field, and after an explosive moment he\r\ncarried him off to our hut.  Grinson is a big burly fellow, with a heart\r\nas tender as a woman's.'\r\n\r\n'A mixture you 'll often find among sailormen, if I may say so,' said\r\nthe captain.  'But Grinson mustn't have all the credit, you know, Mr.\r\nTrentham.  That dodge of yours with the Raider----'\r\n\r\n'Is she sunk?' asked Trentham.\r\n\r\n'Sunk by the stern; all below water except a bit of her fore deck and\r\nher funnel.  But she can be salved, and there 'll be something to share\r\nout, or I 'm a Dutchman.'\r\n\r\n'You came into the cove?'\r\n\r\n'I did, sir, and anchored within half a cable's length of the Raider.  A\r\ncouple of Germans on shore flung up their hands at once, and we marched\r\nup under Mr. Hoole's lead without delay.  You 're surprised to see no\r\nmore of us, but the fact is, we met the Germans running for their lives.\r\nThey were glad enough to surrender, for these savages don't know the\r\nmeaning of mercy, and I 'm afraid they had already killed a number of\r\nthem before we came on the scene. However, my ship's company--the\r\nqueerest mixture I ever commanded--are marching the rest of them down to\r\nthe cove, and as I 've plenty of cargo space on board, I gave 'em orders\r\nto drop them into the hold; by this time to-morrow we 'll hand 'em over\r\nin proper form as prisoners of war.  I take it you 're ready to come\r\nwith us?'\r\n\r\n'Quite, I can assure you.  But I think we ought to bury the German dead\r\nfirst.  These people are cannibals.'\r\n\r\n'Burying 's no good; they 'd dig 'em up as soon as our backs were\r\nturned.  We can't give them seamen's burial, the sea being so far away.\r\nThe only thing left is to burn them; certainly we couldn't leave them\r\nfor a cannibal feast.  And we had better set about it while most of the\r\nsavages are away; there 'll be less trouble.  Oh! here we are. A most\r\nuncommon native village.  A few photographers will take a trip out here\r\nwhen your story is known.  That's Grinson, I suppose.  Who 's the fellow\r\nwith him?'\r\n\r\nGrinson was walking towards the hut, accompanied by the medicine-man\r\ncarrying water in a huge banana stalk.  Trentham laughed.\r\n\r\n'That's the village doctor,' he said.  'A thorn in our flesh until\r\nGrinson tamed him by a sort of strong man exhibition.  Now he 'll follow\r\nGrinson like a dog.'\r\n\r\n'Natural philosophy,' said Hoole.  'The Germans will be the better for a\r\ndose of the same physic.  It's a low order of intelligence that admits\r\nno superiority but brute force, and I guess you must deal with people as\r\nyou find 'em.  Ahoy, Grinson!  How 's Meek?'\r\n\r\n'Doing well, sir,' roared Grinson.  He came towards the three men, the\r\nmedicine-man trotting behind, and said in a confidential whisper, 'You\r\nmust humour poor Ephraim a bit, gentlemen.  He 's got it fair fixed in\r\nhis mind as there 's no justice in this world, and nothing 'll shake\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\n'Why?' asked Trentham.\r\n\r\n''Cos he was knocked out afore he began to fight.  I never knowed\r\nEphraim so obstropolous.  He 'll hardly speak civil to me; says I kep'\r\nhim out of it on purpose, a-holding revolvers as any funk could 'a done;\r\nand then, when he 'd picked up a spear in spite o' me, blest if he\r\nwasn't spun round directly afore he had a chanst.  I told him wounds is\r\nhonourable, and he rounded on me; \"Honour be deed,\" says he, most\r\nunusual language for Ephraim; \"they never give me a chanst; there's no\r\njustice in this world, not a morsel.\"  Humour him, gents, if you 'll be\r\nso kind, and I dare say with time he 'll be the same lad again.'\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve hours later, under a brilliant moon, the little tramp _Wanda_\r\npuffed out of the cove on her voyage eastward.  Trentham, the centre of\r\nan interested group, was relating in detail the story of the past weeks.\r\nSome distance away, sitting on the deck with his back against a coil of\r\nrope, Grinson, in tones much subdued, talked to Meek, slung in a hammock\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n'Yes, Ephraim, Mr. Hoole came out in his true colours at last, just\r\nafore he flew away, which I mean to say he's true blue, and not a\r\ndeceiving coat o' paint like that there Raider, though I own he did take\r\nus in, but no great sin.  He 's a inventor, Ephraim; invented something\r\nas 'll make them airyplanes terrible engines o' mischief, and when I\r\nsaid as how there was enough mischief in the world----'\r\n\r\n'There 's no justice in it.'\r\n\r\n'I was coming to that.  When I said as how there was enough mischief in\r\nthis wicked world, he laughed, he did, and said what he 'd invented\r\nwould do for sewing machines when the war 's over.  Now ain't there\r\njustice in that?  Look at it straight, Ephraim, me lad.  The Germans\r\nmust be beat, or what's the good of anythink? Well, then, this notion o'\r\nMr. Hoole's will help to beat 'em; Mr. Trentham says it's certain.\r\nWell, then, it's a good thing, and good things didn't oughter be wasted,\r\nso when the war 's over he just reverses the engine, as you may say, and\r\nthen it's sewing machines what 'll make shirts and other peaceful\r\nthings.  Ain't there justice in that?'\r\n\r\n'I never had a chanst.'\r\n\r\n'No, and I feel for you; I wouldn't like it myself.  But there 's more\r\njustice.  By what Cap'n Rolfe says, they 're calling for hands for the\r\nRoyal Navy, and I 'm going to sign on, and in course you 'll sign on\r\ntoo.  Well, now, s'pose you 'd got your chanst, and been killed, like\r\nTrousers--'cos a savage speared him arter Mr. Trentham made him\r\nhelpless--you might a' been killed; then you wouldn't have got my poll\r\nparrot, and you wouldn't 'a been alive to sign on with me, and no chanst\r\nthen o' beating the Germans and making 'em sick o' themselves, and\r\nmedals and all.  Look at it straight, Ephraim, and you 'll see 'tis all\r\njustice, to say nothing of merciful Providence.'\r\n\r\n'I don't rightly see as I can bear you out, Mr. Grinson,' said Meek\r\nsleepily.\r\n\r\n'But you will, Ephraim, you will, me lad.... He 's going off, sir,'\r\nGrinson whispered as Trentham came up.

In this book he turns to Africa, where the\r\ncolonising activity of rival powers is raising problems of the greatest\r\ninterest and importance.  The presence of a young Englishman in one of\r\nthe debatable lands at a time of upheaval and international rivalry\r\nenables him to uphold the interests of the Empire against formidable\r\nopposition.

Illustrated in Colour by CYRUS\r\nCUNEO.\r\n\r\nIn this book Mr. Strang looks ahead--and other books have already proved\r\nhim a prophet of surprising skill--to a time when there is a great\r\nMongolian Empire whose army sweeps down on to the North-West Frontier of\r\nIndia. His two heroes luckily have an aeroplane, and with the help of a\r\nfew Pathan miners they hold a pass in the Hindu Kush against a swarm of\r\nMongols, long enough to prevent the cutting of the communications of the\r\nIndian army operating in Afghanistan.  The qualities which marked Mr.\r\nStrang's last long story, \"The Air Scout,\" and won extraordinarily high\r\ncommendation from Lord Roberts, Lord Curzon, and others, as well as from\r\nthe Spectator and other great journals, are again strikingly displayed;\r\nand the combination of thrilling adventure with an Imperial problem and\r\nexcellent writing, adds one more to this author's long list of\r\nsuccesses.\r\n\r\n\"An exceptionally good book, written moreover in excellent\r\nstyle.\"--_Times_.\r\n\r\n\"The 'Air Patrol' is really a masterpiece.\"--_Morning Post_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Air-Scout\r\n\r\nA Story of National Defence.

In this story Mr. Strang imagines a Chinese descent upon\r\nAustralia, and carries his hero through a series of exciting adventures,\r\nin which the value of national spirit, organisation, and discipline is\r\nexemplified.  The important part which the aeroplane will play in\r\nwarfare is recognised, and the thousands of readers who have delighted\r\nin the author's previous stories of aviation will find this new book\r\nafter their own heart.\r\n\r\nLORD ROBERTS writes: \"It is capital reading, and should interest more\r\nthan boys.

They were among the few who remained true to their\r\nsalt during the trying days of the great Mutiny, vying in gallantry and\r\ndevotion with our best British regiments.  The story tells how James\r\nBarclay, after a strange career in Afghanistan, becomes associated with\r\nthis famous regiment, and though young in years, bears a man's part in\r\nthe great march to Delhi, the capture of the royal city, and the\r\nsuppression of the Mutiny.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Drake on the Spanish Main\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour by ARCHIBALD WEBB.  With Maps.\r\n\r\nA rousing story of adventure by sea and land.  The hero, Dennis\r\nHazelrig, is cast ashore on an island in the Spanish Main, the sole\r\nsurvivor of a band of adventurers from Plymouth.  He lives for some time\r\nwith no companion but a spider monkey, but by a series of remarkable\r\nincidents he gathers about him a numerous band of escaped slaves and\r\nprisoners, English, French and native; captures a Spanish fort; fights a\r\nSpanish galleon; meets Francis Drake, and accompanies him in his famous\r\nadventures on the Isthmus of Panama; and finally reaches England the\r\npossessor of much treasure.  The author has, as usual, devoted much\r\npains to characterisation, and every boy will delight in Amos Turnpenny,\r\nTom Copstone, and other bold men of Devon, and in Mirandola, the monkey.\r\n\r\n\r\nPalm Tree Island\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour by ARCHIBALD WEBB.\r\n\r\nIn this story two boys are left on a volcanic island in the South Seas,\r\ndestitute of everything but their clothes.  The story relates how they\r\nprovided themselves with food and shelter, with tools and weapons; how\r\nthey fought with wild dogs and sea monsters; and how, when they have\r\nsettled down to a comfortable life under the shadow of the volcano,\r\ntheir peace is disturbed by the advent of savages and a crew of mutinous\r\nEnglishmen.  The savages are driven away; the mutineers are subdued\r\nthrough the boys' ingenuity; and they ultimately sail away in a vessel\r\nof their own construction.  In no other book has the author more\r\nadmirably blended amusement with instruction. \"Written so well that\r\nthere Is not a dull page in the book.\"--_The World_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHerbert Strang's Romances of Modern Invention\r\n\r\nBach of the following stories is concerned with some particular\r\ndiscovery of Modern Science, such as the aeroplane and the submarine,\r\nwhich it made use of in the working out of the plot; and the heroes of\r\nthese adventures, who face dangers that were unknown in olden times,\r\ncannot fail to make a strong appeal to boys of to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Flying Boat\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour.\r\n\r\nThe flying boat is a logical development of the hydroplane.  At a\r\nsufficiently high speed, the hydroplane leaves the water and becomes a\r\nhydro-aeroplane. The possession of such a machine gives the hero of the\r\nstory (the scene of which is laid in China) opportunities of highly\r\nexciting adventures, and incidentally the chance of rescuing an old chum\r\nwho has fallen into the hands of Chinese revolutionaries.\r\n\r\n\"The book is alive with vigorous action from cover to cover.

Happily\r\nMr. Herbert Strang has now thought of making it the pivot of a story,\r\nthe scene of which is one of the Latin States of South America.  Mr.\r\nStrang tells the story of an Irish boy who is living in this State just\r\nat the time when one of the periodical revolutions breaks out.  He is\r\nforced to take sides, and with the help of his motor-cycle is able to\r\nassist his friends, but not without running risks unknown to scouts\r\nprovided with less novel means of traversing the country. \"A really fine\r\nstory, full of life, and one that any boy can enjoy.\"--_Outlook_.\r\n\r\n\r\nRound the World in Seven Days\r\n\r\nThe Story of an Aeroplane.

It not\r\nonly contains personal memoirs of the men themselves, but traces the\r\nprogress of aerial flight from the early gliders to the aeroplanes of\r\nto-day.  The story of the experiments of those who first essayed to\r\nfly--the problems that long baffled them and the difficulties they\r\novercame--together with the accounts of the daring feats of modern\r\naviators, make a stirring narrative, and carry the history of heroism\r\nand endurance a stage further forward.\r\n\r\n\"This will prove a great attraction to a multitude of readers who wish\r\nto read of deeds of great daring and very narrow escapes.\"--_Nation_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the Airmen\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour by CYRUS CUNEO, and with numerous black-and-white\r\nillustrations and diagrams.\r\n\r\nMr. Grahame-White has not only repeatedly proved his skill and daring as\r\na pilot, but the well-known type of biplane bearing his name shows that\r\nhe is in the forefront of designers and constructors.  With his\r\npractical and technical knowledge is combined the somewhat rare ability\r\nto impart his knowledge in a form acceptable to boys, as he has already\r\nshown in his \"Heroes of the Air.\"  This time he has written a vade mecum\r\nfor the young aeroplanist, who is conducted to the aerodrome and\r\ninitiated into all the mysteries of flying. The structure of the\r\naeroplane, the uses of the different parts, the propulsive mechanism,\r\nthe steering apparatus, the work at a flying school, the causes of\r\naccidents, and the future of the aeroplane are all dealt with.\r\n\r\n\"It is surely one of the most entertaining books on a technical subject\r\nthat have ever appeared, as well as one of the most instructive and\r\ncomprehensive.\"--_Nation_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       By CAPTAIN CHARLES GILSON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sword of Freedom\r\n\r\nA Story of the English Revolution.  Illustrated in Colour by FRANK\r\nGILLETT, R.I.\r\n\r\n\"The Sword of Freedom\" deals with a critical period of English History:\r\nthe downfall of the House of Stuart.  In his grasp of the political\r\nsituation in this country before the coming of William of Orange, as\r\nwell as in his descriptions of contemporary life and manners, Captain\r\nGilson shows himself to be not merely a recorder of stirring events, but\r\nan historian of no mean order.  At the same time the story is exciting\r\nenough to please the most exacting, and the adventures of Sir Richard\r\nVyse, who is arrested for complicity in the plot to bring over the\r\nPrince of Orange, and confined in the Tower, from which he makes a\r\ndaring escape, will be followed with breathless interest.\r\n\r\n\"It is a most spirited tale and holds the reader from start to\r\nfinish.\"--_Guardian_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spy\r\n\r\nA Story of the Peninsular War.

These qualities are seen to perfection in \"The Spy.\"\r\nThe hero, Sir Jeffery Jones, Bart., when a boy of sixteen, secures a\r\ncommission in a famous foot regiment, then under orders to sail for\r\nPortugal under the command of Sir Arthur Wellesley.  His first encounter\r\nwith the enemy takes place before he is fifty miles from home, for on\r\nthe road to London he pursues and comes near to capturing a spy in the\r\npay of Bonaparte.  Several times subsequently the paths of the two\r\ncross, and eventually Sir Jeffery is the means of thwarting the\r\nFrenchman's schemes.  He takes part in much of the fighting in the\r\nPeninsula, and, at the storming of Badajoz and elsewhere, renders his\r\ncountry good service.\r\n\r\n\"Every boy who loves tales of war and perilous enterprise--and what boy\r\ndoes not?--will read 'The Spy' with unqualified enjoyment.\"--_Bookman_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lost Empire\r\n\r\nA Tale of Many Lands.

While in Paris he obtained possession of\r\nNapoleon's plans for the capture of India, and, after many adventures,\r\nwas the means of frustrating that ambitious scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lost Column\r\n\r\nA Story of the Boxer Rebellion.  Illustrated in Colour by CYRUS CUNEO.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the great Boxer Rebellion in China, Gerald Wood, the\r\nhero of this story, was living with his mother and brother at Milton\r\nTowers, just outside Tientsin.  When the storm broke and Tientsin was\r\ncut off from the rest of the world, the occupants of Milton Towers made\r\na gallant defence, but were compelled by force of numbers to retire into\r\nthe town.  Then Gerald determined to go in quest of the relief column\r\nunder Admiral Seymour.  He carried his life in his hands, and on more\r\nthan one occasion came within an ace of losing it; but he managed to\r\nreach his goal in safety, and was warmly commended by the Admiral on his\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pirate Aeroplane\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour by C.

This race--the Asmalians--has lived isolated from other\r\ncommunities.  The scientific importance of this discovery is apparent to\r\nthe travellers, and they are enthusiastic to know more of these strange\r\npeople; but suddenly they find themselves in the midst of exciting\r\nadventures owing to the appearance of a pirate aeroplane--of a\r\nthoroughly up-to-date model--whose owner has learnt of a vast store of\r\ngold in the Asmalians' city.  They throw in their lot with the people,\r\nand are able in the end to frustrate the plans of the freebooter.\r\n\r\n\"The story is a riot of adventure.

The prologue describes how Thomas Gaythorne\r\nobtained access to a Lama monastery, where he rendered the monks such\r\ngreat service that they bestowed upon him a gem of priceless value known\r\nas Gautama's Eye.  Soon after leaving the monastery he was attacked and\r\nrobbed, and only narrowly escaped with his life.  \"The Lost Island\"\r\ndescribes the attempt of one of Thomas Gaythorne's descendants to\r\nre-discover the missing gem; and he passes through some remarkable\r\nadventures before he succeeds in this quest.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Race Round the World\r\n\r\nAn Account of the Contest for the L100,000 Prize offered by the Combined\r\nNewspaper League.  Coloured Illustrations by CYRUS CUNEO, and a map of\r\nthe route of The Swallow.\r\n\r\nOld Silas Agge has invented a new motor spirit, far more potent than\r\npetrol, and with this secret in his possession he has no doubt that he\r\nwill win the L100,000 offered by a Newspaper League to the winner of the\r\nAeroplane Race round the World.  But a foreigner, with whom Silas has\r\nhad business relations, succeeds in obtaining, first, the design of the\r\naeroplane which the old man has built, and next, a sufficient quantity\r\nof the new spirit to carry him round the world.  The race thus becomes a\r\nduel between these two rivals. Guy Kingston, a daring young aviator and\r\nnephew to Silas, pilots his uncle's aeroplane, and at every stage of the\r\nrace finds himself matched against an unscrupulous adversary.

Unfortunately for the head master's ambition,\r\nhowever, the two sets of boys--hitherto rivals and enemies, now\r\nschoolfellows--do not take kindly to one another.  Warner's men of might\r\nare discredited in the new school; Henderson, lately head boy, finds\r\nhimself a mere nobody; while the inoffensive Dove is exalted and made\r\nprefect by reason of his attainments in class work.  There is discord\r\nand insurrection and talk of expulsion, and the feud drags on until the\r\nrival factions have an opportunity of uniting against a common enemy.\r\nThen, in the enthusiasm aroused by the overthrow of a neighbouring\r\nagricultural college, the bitterness between them dies away, and the\r\nfuture of Winton is assured.\r\n\r\n\"This tale is told with a remarkable spirit, and all the boys are real,\r\neveryday characters drawn without exaggeration.\"--_British Weekly_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe House Prefect\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour by H.

In particular does the spirited exploit with which it\r\nopens--the whitewashing by night of a town statue and the smashing of\r\ncertain school property--raise itself against him, next term, when he\r\nhas been set in authority.

They figure largely in this story, for the two heroes, after\r\nsuffering shipwreck, fall into the hands of natives, who spare their\r\nlives and treat them with rough kindness.

Each of the five Macleods possesses an\r\nindividuality of her own. Elspeth is the eldest--sixteen, with her hair\r\n\"very nearly up\"--and her lovable nature makes her a favourite with\r\nevery one; she is followed, in point of age, by the would-be masterful\r\nWinifred (otherwise Winks) and the independent Lil; while little Babs\r\nand Dorothy bring up the rear.\r\n\r\n\"Altogether a most charming story for girls.\"--_Schoolmaster_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNina's Career\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour by JAMES BURDEN.\r\n\r\n\"Nina's Career\" tells delightfully of a large family of girls and boys,\r\nchildren of Sir Christopher Howard.

WHITFELD\r\n\r\n\r\nTom who was Rachel\r\n\r\nA Story of Australian Life.  Illustrated in Colour by N. TENISON.\r\n\r\nThis is a story of Colonial life by an author who is new to English\r\nreaders. In writing about Australia Miss Whitfeld is, in a very literal\r\nsense, at home; and no one can read her book without coming to the\r\nconclusion that she is equally so in drawing pen portraits of children.\r\nHer work possesses all the vigour and freshness that one usually\r\nassociates with the Colonies, and at the same time preserves the best\r\ntraditions of Louisa Alcott.  In \"Tom who was Rachel\" the author has\r\ndescribed a large family of children living on an up-country station;\r\nand the story presents a faithful picture of the everyday life of the\r\nbush.  Rachel (otherwise Miss Thompson, abbreviated to \"Miss Tom,\"\r\nafterwards to \"Tom\") is the children's step-sister; and it is her\r\ninfluence for good over the wilder elements in their nature that\r\nprovides the real motive of a story for which all English boys and girls\r\nwill feel grateful.\r\n\r\n\r\nGladys and Jack\r\n\r\nAn Australian Story for Girls.  Coloured Illustrations by N. TENISON.\r\n\r\nGladys and Jack are sister and brother, and, up to the point when the\r\nstory opens, they have been the best of friends.  Then, however, certain\r\ninfluences begin to work in the mind of Gladys, as the result of which a\r\ncoolness springs up between her and her brother.  Gladys puts on a\r\nsuperior air, and adopts a severely proper attitude towards Jack.\r\nGladys has been in society, has come to be regarded as a beauty, and has\r\nbeen made a fuss of; consequently she becomes self-conscious.  She goes\r\nto spend a holiday up-country, and here, too, her icily-regular line of\r\nconduct seems bound to bring her into conflict with her\r\nfree-and-easy-going cousins.  After some trying experiences, Gladys\r\nfinds herself In a position which enables her, for the time being, to\r\nforget her own troubles, and exert all her strength on behalf of the\r\nrest.  She comes worthily through the ordeal, earns the affection of her\r\ncousins, and Jack rejoices in the recovery of a lost sister.\r\n\r\n\"We have a large number of characters all clearly differentiated, plenty\r\nof incident, and much sparkling dialogue.\"--_Morning Post_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Colters\r\n\r\nAn Australian Story for Girls.  Illustrated in Colour by GEORGE SOPER.\r\n\r\nThis book deals with a merry family of Australian boys and girls.  There\r\nare a good many of them, and to each one Miss Whitfeld has imparted a\r\ndistinct individuality.  There is Hector, the eldest, manly and\r\nstraightforward, and Matt, the plain-spoken, his younger brother.  Ruby,\r\nquiet and gentle, with an aptitude for versifying, is well contrasted\r\nwith her headstrong, impulsive cousin Effie.

When she is first introduced to us she\r\nis staying on a holiday at Quantuck, a secluded seaside retreat; and\r\nMiss Ray describes the various members of this small summer community\r\nwith considerable humour.  Among others is Mrs. Van Hicks, a lady of\r\ngreat possessions but little culture, who seeks to put people under a\r\nlasting obligation to her by making friends with them.  On hearing that\r\na nephew of this estimable lady is about to arrive at Quantuck, Betty\r\nmakes up her mind beforehand to dislike him.  At first she almost\r\nsucceeds, for, like herself, Percival has a temper, and can be \"thorny\"\r\nat times.

She is, indeed, merely Nathalie's sister, without a name of\r\nher own, shining with a borrowed light.  Before the end is reached,\r\nhowever, her many good qualities have received the recognition they\r\ndeserve, and she is Margaret Arterburn, enjoying the respect and\r\nadmiration of all her friends. Her temper is none of the best: she has a\r\nway of going direct to the point in conversation, and her words have\r\nsometimes an unpleasant sting; yet when the time comes, she reveals that\r\nshe is not lacking in the qualities of gentleness and affection, not to\r\nsay heroism, which many young readers have already learned to associate\r\nwith her sister Nathalie.\r\n\r\n\r\nNathalie's Chum\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour by DUDLEY TENNANT.\r\n\r\nThis story deals with a chapter in the career of the Arterburn family,\r\nand particularly of Nathalie, a vivacious, strong-willed girl of\r\nfifteen.  After the death of their parents the children were scattered\r\namong different relatives, and the story describes the efforts of the\r\neldest son, Harry, to bring them together again. At first there is a\r\ngood deal of aloofness owing to the fact that, having been kept apart\r\nfor so long, the children are practically strangers to each other; but\r\nat length Harry takes his sister Nathalie into his confidence and makes\r\nher his ally in the management of their small household, while she finds\r\nin him the chum of whom she has long felt the need.\r\n\r\n\"Another of those pleasant stories of American life which Miss Anna\r\nChapin Ray knows so well how to write.\"--_Birmingham Post_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTeddy: Her Book\r\n\r\nA Story of Sweet Sixteen.

When his parents beheld this star\r\nthey were filled with gladness and fear, and they carried their little\r\nFairy baby, Merrywink, far away and hid him, because of two old\r\nprophecies: the first, that a daughter should be born to the King and\r\nQueen of Fairyland; the second that the King should rule over Fairyland\r\nuntil a child appeared with a star in his forehead.  Now, on the very\r\nday that Merrywink was born, the little Princess arrived at the Palace;\r\nand the King sent round messages to make sure that the child with the\r\ngleaming star had not yet been seen in Fairyland.

On his arrival he\r\nis found to be very frank and outspoken, accustomed to say just what he\r\nthinks; and as his cousins are more reserved, the misunderstandings are\r\nby no means few. In time, however, he becomes used to English ways, and\r\nhis good nature and cleverness win his cousins' admiration and\r\naffection.  Mrs. Bradby writes as one who knows children thoroughly, and\r\nher pictures of home life are very charming.\r\n\r\n\"The authoress shows a power of depicting a large family of delightful\r\nand quite natural children which recalls the stories of Miss Yonge at\r\nher brightest.\"--_Church Times_.\r\n\r\n\"A very pleasant, natural, and brightly written story.\"--_Lady_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Happy Families\r\n\r\nIllustrated by LILIAN A. GOVEY.\r\n\r\nMost children have probably played the game of \"Happy Families,\" and it\r\nis possible that they have woven stories round the grotesque characters\r\nthat appear on the cards.  This is what Mrs. Bradby has done in this\r\nbook, and she has imagined a little girl being suddenly transported to\r\nHappy Family Land and finding herself beset on all hands by the Grits,\r\nthe Chips and the Boneses, and all the other members of this strange and\r\nwonderful community.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         By FLORENCE E. DUGDALE\r\n\r\n                          (MRS. THOMAS HARDY)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Lucy's Garden\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour by J. CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\nMiss Dugdale describes Lucy's garden from month to month, the plants\r\nthat grow there, the insects that visit it, and the imaginary beings\r\nwith which Lucy peoples it.  During the first year Lucy is without any\r\ncompanion to share her experiences, but at the beginning of the second\r\nyear, just when she begins to feel lonely, she makes the acquaintance of\r\na little boy, Peter, who is staying with his grandmother next door, and\r\nwho, too, has grown tired of playing by himself.  They gladly arrange\r\nthat in future they will play together, as they like each other very\r\nmuch.  Little ones who have gardens of their own will enjoy reading\r\nabout Lucy's, especially when they know that she was capable of\r\nunderstanding what the apple trees and leaves and roses had to tell her\r\nabout things in general and themselves in particular.\r\n\r\n\"A delightful 'Nature story' written in a charming vein of playful\r\nfancy, and daintily illustrated.\"--_Lady_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           By TERTIA BENNETT\r\n\r\n\r\nGentleman Dash\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour by P. H. JOWETT.\r\n\r\nThis is a book that will appeal to all lovers of animals.  Gentleman\r\nDash is a fine collie who lives at a big house with a number of other\r\ndogs and cats. In spite of his handsome appearance, however, Dash\r\nsometimes falls so far from dignity as to run away and steal meat from\r\nbutchers' shops.  Then he is brought back and punished, and the other\r\nfour-footed members of the family come round and offer sympathy--which\r\nis not pleasant.  The relations that exist between the various dogs and\r\ncats of the establishment are friendly on the whole, though not\r\ninvariably so.  In the course of their conversations, the animals throw\r\nfresh light on the problems of life as viewed from the kennel and the\r\nyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            By ALICE MASSIE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Family's Jane\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour by JOHN CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of a little girl's search for her lost brothers and\r\nsisters.  At first Jane did not know that she had any brothers or\r\nsisters, and she used to feel lonely.  Then one day, quite by accident,\r\nshe discovered that such was indeed the case, although for some\r\nunexplained reason they did not live at home and she had been kept in\r\nignorance of them.  Then Jane set to work to reunite the dismembered\r\nfamily.  The fact that Jane was only eight, and some of the others were\r\nquite grown up, with children of their own, did not turn her from her\r\npurpose, and eventually her efforts had the happy issue which they well\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        The Children's Bookcase\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Edited by E.
