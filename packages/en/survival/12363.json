EITHER GROWING WILD IN GREAT BRITAIN, OR CULTIVATED FOR THE\r\nPUROSES OF AGRICULTURE, MEDICINE, RURAL OECONOMY, OR THE ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy WILLIAM SALISBURY, OF THE BOTANIC GARDEN OF SLOANE-STREET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed, and every tree\r\nyielding fruit, and to you it shall be for meat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOL. II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn demonstrating the Plants which occur in our annual herborizing\r\nexcursions, I have found it necessary to put into the hands of my pupils\r\nsome Manual of Botany; and in so doing I have found all that have yet\r\nbeen published, deficient in one or two essential points, and\r\nparticularly as relating to the uses to which each plant is adapted;\r\nwith out which, although the charms of the Flora are in themselves truly\r\ndelightful, yet the real value of Botanic knowledge is lost. The study\r\nof plants, so far as regards their uses and culture, has engaged my\r\nparticular attention for the last twenty-five years, during which time I\r\nhad the honour of conducting a series of experiments on the growth of\r\nplants, for the Board of Agriculture, which gave me an opportunity of\r\nascertaining many facts relative to our Grasses, &c. an account of\r\nwhich, I have had some time ready for publication. The necessity of a\r\nwork of this kind in my present profession, has therefore induced me to\r\nabridge it and put it to press; as such I offer it to the Public. To the\r\nSubscribers to my Botanic Garden this will also prove of great service;\r\nit being intended to arrange the plants in their several departments, so\r\nas to make it a general work of reference both in the fields or garden.\r\nIn the department which treats of the Vegetables used for medicinal\r\npurposes, I have given as ample descriptions as the nature of the work\r\nwill admit of, having in view the very necessary obligation which the\r\nyounger branch of the profession are under, of paying attention to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIn prosecuting this work, I have been more actuated by a desire to\r\nrender to my pupils and others, useful in-formation, than that of\r\ncommencing Author on such a subject; and writing for the press has been\r\nbut very little my employment, I trust that an ample excuse will be\r\ngranted for any errors that may appear, or for the want of that\r\nhappiness of diction with which more able and accomplished Authors may\r\nbe endowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOTANIC GARDEN,\r\n\r\nSloane Street, May 1816.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF THE SECOND VOLUME\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTS USEFUL IN AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 1.

One would\r\ntherefore naturally wonder, after this truth has been so long published,\r\nand that in an age when agriculture and the arts have so much improved,\r\nthat Select Seeds of this tribe of plants are scarcely to be produced.\r\n\r\nFrom the experience I have had on this subject, I find their culture is\r\nattended with certain difficulties, which arise not so much from the\r\nnature of the plants, as from the labour requisite to this purpose,\r\ngreat attention being necessary for saving Grass-seeds at the seasons\r\nwhen the farmer must exert all the strength of his husbandmen to get his\r\nother business accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe only mode by which this can be effected is by selecting a proper\r\nsoil for the kinds intended to be saved. The seeds should be drilled\r\ninto the ground at about one foot distance; and care taken that the\r\nplants are duly weeded of all other kinds that may intrude themselves,\r\nbefore they get too firm possession of the soil. The hoe should be\r\nfrequently passed between the drills, in order both to keep the land\r\nclean and to give vigour to the young plants. The sowing may be done\r\neither in the spring or in the month of September, which will enable the\r\ncrop to go to seed the following spring. In order to preserve a\r\nsuccession of crops, it is necessary every season to keep the ground\r\nclean all the summer months, to dig or otherwise turn up the land\r\nbetween the drills early in the spring, and to be particular in the\r\nother operations until the seeds ripen. Now this business being so\r\ninconvenient to the farmer, it is not to be wondered at, that, wherever\r\nattempts of this kind have been made, they should fail from want of the\r\nnecessary care as above stated, without which it is needless to\r\nspeculate in such an undertaking. There is nevertheless still an\r\nopportunity, for any one who would give up his land and time to the\r\npursuit, to reap a rich and important harvest; as nothing would pay him\r\nbetter, or redound more to his credit, than to get our markets regularly\r\nsupplied with select seeds of the best indigenous Grasses, so that a\r\nproper portion of them may be used for forming pasture and meadow-land.\r\n\r\nThe above hints are not thrown out by a person who wishes to speculate\r\nin a theory which is new, but by one who has cultivated those plants\r\nhimself both for seed and fodder, and who would readily wish to promote\r\ntheir culture by stating a mode which has proved to him a profitable\r\npursuit, and for which he has, already, been honoured with a reward form\r\nthe Society of Arts.\r\n\r\nThe following observations are intended to embrace such kinds only as\r\nare likely to be cultivated, with those that are distinguished for some\r\nparticular good properties; as it would be impossible within the limits\r\nof this small memorandum to enumerate all the plants that are eaten by\r\ncattle. The same mode shall be pursued under all the different heads in\r\nthis department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTS USEFULL IN AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I.--GRASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ANTHOXANTHUM odoratum. SWEET-SCENTED VERNAL-GRASS.--This is found\r\nfrequently in all our best meadows, to which it is of great benefit. It\r\nis an early, though not the most productive grass, and is much relished\r\nby all kinds of cattle. It is highly odoriferous; if bruised it\r\ncommunicates its agreeable scent to the fingers, and when dry perfumes\r\nthe hay. It will grow in almost any soil or situation. About three\r\npounds of seed should be sown with other grasses for an acre of land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ALOPECURUS pratensis. MEADOW FOX-TAIL-GRASS.--One of our most\r\nproductive plants of this tribe: it grows best in a moist soil, is very\r\nearly, being often fit for the scythe by the middle of May. About two\r\nbushels of seed will sow an acre, with a proportionate quantity of\r\nClover; which see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ALOPECURUS geniculatus. FLOTE FOX-TAIL-GRASS.--Is very good in water\r\nmeadows, being nutritive, and cattle in general are fond of it. We do\r\nnot know if the cultivation of this plant has as yet been attempted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. AGROSTIS capillaris. FINE BENT-GRASS.--Dr. Walker, in his History of\r\nthe Hebrides, speaks very favourably of this grass. I have therefore\r\nnoticed it here, but I do not think it so good as many others. It grows\r\non the sandy hills near Combe Wood in Surrey, and forms the principal\r\npart of the pasturage; but it is neither very productive, nor are cattle\r\nobserved to thrive on it. The seeds are very small; one peck would sow\r\nan acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. AGROSTIS pyramidalis. FIORIN-GRASS [Footnote: Fiorin is the Irish\r\nname of butter].--No plant has engaged the attention of the farmer more\r\nthan this grass, none ever produced more disputes, and none is perhaps\r\nso little understood. It is perfectly distinct from any species of\r\nAgrostis indigenous to this country: it is introduced by Dr. Richardson,\r\nand to that gentleman's extraordinary account of it we are indebted for\r\nnumerous mistakes that have been made respecting it. It is an amphibious\r\nplant, thriving only in water or wet soils, is very productive, and the\r\nstalks after a summer's growth secrete a large quantity of sugar. It has\r\nthe power, when the stalks are ripe, of resisting putrefaction, and will\r\nbecome blanched and more nutritious by being cut and laid in heaps in\r\nthe winter season, at which time only it is useful. The cultivator of\r\nthis plant must not expect to graze his land, but allow all the growth\r\nto be husbanded as above; and although it will not be found generally\r\nadvantageous on this account, it nevertheless may be grown to very great\r\nadvantage either in wet soils, or where land can be flooded at pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are often barren; and the only mode is to plant the shoots or\r\nstrings in drills at nine inches apart, laying them lengthways along the\r\ndrills, the ends of one touching the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. AIRA aquatica. WATER HAIR-GRASS.--This is an aquatic, and very much\r\nrelished by cattle, but cannot be propagated for fodder. Water-fowl are\r\nvery fond of the young sweet shoots, as also of the seeds; it may\r\ntherefore be introduced into decoys and other places with good effect.\r\nPulling up the plants and throwing them into the water with a weight\r\ntied to them, is the best mode of introducing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. ARUNDO arenaria. SEA-SIDE REED-GRASS.--This is also of no value as\r\nfodder, but it possesses the property of forming by its thick and wiry\r\nroots considerable hillocks on the shores where it naturally grows:\r\nhence its value on all new embankments. If it be planted in a sandy\r\nplace, during its growth in the summer the loose soil will be collected\r\nin the herbage, and the grass continues to grow and form roots in it;\r\nand thus is the hillock increased. Local acts of parliament have been\r\npassed, and now exist, for preventing its destruction on the sea-coast\r\nin some parts of Great Britain, on this account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. ARUNDO Phragmites. COMMON REED.--Is useful for thatching, and making\r\nslight fences; it grows best in ponds near streams of water; it does not\r\noften seed, but it could easily be introduced to such places by planting\r\nits roots in spring: it is a large-growing plant; and where herbage may\r\nbe wanted either for beauty or shelter for water-fowl, nothing can be\r\nmore suitable, and the reeds are of great value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. AVENA flavescens. YELLOW OAT-GRASS.--Is much eaten by cattle, and\r\nforms a good bottom. It has the property of throwing up flowerstalks all\r\nthe summer; hence its produce is considerable, and it appears to be well\r\nadapted to pasture. The seeds of this grass are not to be obtained\r\nseparately; hence it is not in cultivation. It is however worthy of\r\nattention, as the seeds are produced very abundantly in its native\r\nplaces of growth. It will grow either in wet or dry soils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. AVENA pubescens. ROUGH OAT-GRASS.--This appears to have some merits,\r\nbut the foliage is extremely bitter. It grows in dry soils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11. AVENA elatior. TALL OAT-GRASS.--From the good appearance of this\r\ngrass some persons have recommended it as likely to be useful for\r\nforming meadows; but it is excessively bitter, and is not liked by\r\ncattle generally, though when starved they are sometimes observed to eat\r\nof it. There is a variety of it with knobby roots which is found to be a\r\nmost troublesome and noxious weed in arable lands, particularly in some\r\nparts of the coast of Hampshire where it abounds. This variety was some\r\nyears ago introduced into the island of St. Kitts, and it has since\r\ntaken such firm possession of the land as to render a large district\r\nquite useless. Persons should be cautious how they speculate with weeds\r\nfrom appearances only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12. BRIZA media. QUAKING-GRASS.--Is common in meadow land, and helps to\r\nmake a thick bottom; it does not however appear to be worth the trouble\r\nof select culture. It is bitter to the taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13. BROMUS mollis. SOFT BROME-GRASS.--Mr. Curtis has given a very clear\r\naccount of this grass, which he says predominates much in the meadows\r\nnear London, but that the seeds are usually ripe and the grass dried up\r\nbefore the hay time: hence it is lost; and he in consequence considered\r\nit only in the light of a weed. It has seldom occurred to me to differ\r\nin opinion from this gentleman, who certainly has given us, as far as it\r\ngoes, a most perfect description of our useful grasses: but experience\r\nhas convinced me that the Soft Brome-Grass, which seeds and springs up\r\nso early, makes the chief bulk of most of our meadows in March and\r\nApril; and although it is ripe and over, or nearly so, by the hay\r\nharvest, yet the food it yields at this early season is of the greatest\r\nmoment, as little else is found fit for the food of cattle before the\r\nmeadow is shut up for hay, and this plant being eaten down at that\r\nseason is not any loss to the hay crop. Whoever examines the seeds of\r\nthis grass will be led to admire how wonderfully it is fitted to make\r\nits way into the soil at the season of its ripening, when the land is\r\nthus covered with the whole produce of a meadow. I notice this curious\r\npiece of mechanism [Footnote: Many seeds of the grasses are provided with\r\nawns which curl up in dry weather and relax with moisture. Thus by\r\nchange of atmosphere a continued motion is occasioned, which enables the\r\nseeds to find their way through the foliage to the soil, where it buries\r\nitself in a short time in a very curious manner.], not that it is\r\naltogether peculiar to this plant, but to show that Nature has provided\r\nit means of succeeding in burying itself in the ground, when all the\r\nendeavours of man could not sow the land with any other to answer a\r\nsimilar purpose. If the seeds of this grass were collected and\r\nintroduced in some meadows where it is not common, I am sure the early\r\nfeeding would be thereby improved.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are sometimes mixed with those of Rye-grass at market, and it\r\nis known by the name of Cocks: it has the effect of reducing such\r\nsamples in value, but I should not hesitate in preferring such to any\r\nother. If any one should be inclined to make the above experiment, two\r\npecks of the seed sown on an acre will be sufficient.---See Treatise on\r\nBrit. Grasses by Mr. Curtis, edit. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14. CYNOSURUS cristatus. CRESTED DOG'S-TAIL-GRASS.--A very fine herbage,\r\nand much relished by sheep, &c.; it grows best in fine upland loam,\r\nwhere it is found to be a most excellent plant both for grazing and hay.\r\nThe seeds are to be purchased sometimes at the seedshops. About twelve\r\npounds will sow an acre.---See Observations on laying Land to Grass, in\r\nthe Appendix to this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15. CYNOSURUS coeruleus. BLUE DOG'S-TAIL-GRASS.--Dr. Walker states this\r\nplant to be remarkably agreeable to cattle, and that it grows nearly\r\nthree feet high in mountainous situations and very exposed places. As\r\nthis grass does not grow wild in this part of the country, we have no\r\nopportunity of considering its merits. In our Botanic Garden it seldom\r\nexceeds the height of ten inches or a foot.\r\n\r\nIt is the earliest grass of all our British species, being often in\r\nbloom in February.\r\n\r\nThe above intelligent gentleman, who seems to have studied the British\r\nGramina to a considerable extent, says that the following kinds give\r\nconsiderable food to sheep and cattle in such situations; I shall\r\ntherefore mention their names, as being with us of little esteem and\r\nsimilar to the above.\r\n\r\nPhleum alpinum. Eriophorum polystachion. Festuca decumbens. Carex\r\nflavescens. Carex gigantea, probably Pseudocyperus. Carex trigona,\r\nprobably vulpina. Carex elata, probably atrata. Carex nemorosa, probably\r\npendula. And he is of opinion that the seeds may be sown to advantage.\r\nBe this as may, the observation can only apply to situations in the\r\nnorth of Britain, where he has seen them wild; in this part of the\r\nisland we have a number of kinds much better adapted to soil, climate,\r\nand fodder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16. DACTYLIS glomerata. ROUGH COCK'S-FOOT-GRASS.--Has a remarkable rough\r\ncoarse foliage, and is of little account as a grass for the hay-stack;\r\nbut from its early growth and great produce it is now found to be a\r\nuseful plant, and is the only grass at this time known that will fill\r\nup the dearth experienced by graziers from the time turnips are over\r\nuntil the meadows are fit for grazing. Every sheep-farm should be\r\nprovided with a due portion of this on the land; but no more should be\r\ngrown than is wanted for early feed, and what can be kept closely eaten\r\ndown all the season. If it is left to get up it forms large tufts, and\r\nrenders the field unsightly, and scarcely any animal will eat it when\r\ngrown old or when dried in the form of hay. The seed is to be bought;\r\ntwo bushels per acres is sown usually alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17. FESTUCA elatior. TALL FESCUE-GRASS.--This in its wild state has been\r\nconsidered as a productive and nutritive grass; it grows best in moist\r\nplaces; but the seeds have been found in general abortive, and the grass\r\nconsequently only to be propagated by planting the roots, a trouble by\r\nfar too great to succeed to any extent.--See Poa aquatica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18. FESTUCA duriuscula. HARD FESCUE-GRASS.--A very excellent grass both\r\nfor green fodder and hay, and would be well worth cultivating; but the\r\nseeds have not hitherto been saved in any quantity.\r\n\r\nI have seen a meadow near Bognor where it formed the principal part of\r\nthe herbage; and it was represented to me by the owner as the best\r\nmeadow in the neighbourhood, and the hay excellent [Footnote: Mr. Curtis\r\nobserves that this grass grows thin on the ground after a time. I have\r\nsometimes observed this to be the case in the Botanic Garden, but it is\r\notherwise in its native state of growth. Nothing stands the dry weather\r\nbetter, or makes a more firm sward.].\r\n\r\nThe seeds of this grass are small, and about one bushel would sow an\r\nacre of ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19. FESTUCA rubra. RED or CREEPING FESCUE-GRASS.--A fine grass, very\r\nlike duriuscula; but it is not common in this part of the country; it\r\ngrows plentifully on the mountains in Wales.\r\n\r\nIt does not produce fertile seeds with us in the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20. FESTUCA pratensis. MEADOW FESCUE-GRASS.--No plant whatever deserves\r\nso much the attention of the graziers as this grass. It has been justly\r\nesteemed by Mr. Curtis and all other persons practically acquainted with\r\nthe produce of our meadows. It will grow in almost any soil that is\r\ncapable of sustaining a vegetable, from the banks of rivulets to the top\r\nof the thin-soiled calcareous hills, where it produces herbage equal to\r\nany other plant of the kind; and all descriptions of cattle eat it, and\r\nare nourished by the food. The plant is of easy culture, as it yields\r\nseeds very abundantly, and they grow very readily. I have made some\r\nexcellent meadows with this seed, which after a trial of ten years are\r\nnow equal to any in the kingdom. The culture of the seed selected is\r\nnow nearly lost, which is a misfortune, I had almost ventured to say a\r\ndisgrace, to our agriculture.\r\n\r\nIf the farmer could get his land fit for meadow laid down with one\r\nbushel of this seed, one bushel of Alopecurus pratensis, three pounds of\r\nAnthoxanthum, and a little Bromus mollis, with Clover, I will venture to\r\npredict experience will induce him to say, \"I will seek no further.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21. FESTUCA ovina.--SHEEP'S FESCUE-GRASS.--This is very highly spoken of\r\nin all dissertations that have hitherto been written on the merits of\r\nour grasses; but its value must be confined to alpine situations, for\r\nits diminutive size added to its slow growth renders it in my opinion\r\nvery inferior to the duriuscula. In fact, I am of opinion that these are\r\noften confounded together, and the merits of the former applied to this,\r\nalthough they are different in many respects. Those who wish to obtain\r\nmore of its history may consult Stillingfleet's Observations on Grasses,\r\np. 384.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22. FESTUCA vivipara. VIVIPAROUS FESCUE-GRASS.--This affords a striking\r\ninstance of the protection that Nature has contrived for keeping up the\r\nregular produce of the different species of plants; as when the Festuca\r\novina is found in very high mountainous situations, places not congenial\r\nto the ripening seeds of so light a nature, the panicle is found to\r\nbecome viviparous, i.e. producing perfect plants, which being beaten\r\ndown with heavy rains in the autumn, readily strike root in the ground.\r\n\r\nThis plant was introduced into our garden many years ago, and still\r\npreserves this difference; otherwise it is in all respects the same as\r\nthe Festuca ovina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23. FESTUCA pinnata. SPIKED FESCUE-GRASS.--I have observed this near the\r\nThames side to be the principal grass in some of the most abundant\r\nmeadows; and as the seeds are very plentiful, I am of opinion it might\r\nbe very easily propagated: it is, however, not in cultivation at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24. FESTUCA loliacea. DARNEL FESCUE-GRASS.--This in appearance is very\r\nlike the Lolium perenne, but is a more lasting plant in the ground.\r\nWhere I have seen it wild, it is certainly very good; but it is liable\r\nto the objection of Festuca elatior, the seeds grow but sparingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25. HOLCUS lanatus. YORKSHIRE GRASS, or MEADOW SOFT-GRASS.--This has\r\nbeen much recommended as fit for meadow-land. I am not an advocate for\r\nit. It is late in blooming, and consequently not fit for the scythe at\r\nthe time other grasses are; and I find the lower foliage where it occurs\r\nin meadows to be generally yellow and in a state of decay, from its\r\ntendency to mat and lie prostrate. I hear it has been cultivated in\r\nYorkshire; hence probably its name. Two bushels of the seed would sow\r\nan acre; and it is sometimes met with in our seed-shops. It will grow in\r\nany soil, but thrives best in a moist loam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26. HOLCUS mollis. CREEPING SOFT-GRASS.--Mr. Curtis in the third edition\r\nof his Treatise on Grasses says, he is induced to have a better opinion\r\nthan formerly of this grass, and that Mr. Dorset also thinks it may be\r\ncultivated to advantage in dry sandy soils. I have never seen it exhibit\r\nany appearance that has indicated any such thing, and do not recommend\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27. HORDEUM pratense. MEADOW BARLEY-GRASS.--This is productive, and\r\nforms a good bottom in Battersea meadows: but although I have heard it\r\nhighly recommended, I should fear it was much inferior to many others.\r\nOne species of Barley-grass, which grows very commonly in our\r\nsea-marshes, the Hordeum maritimum, is apt to render cattle diseased in\r\nthe mouth, from chewing the seeds, which are armed with a strong bristly\r\nawn not dissimilar to the spike of this grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28. LOLIUM perenne. RAY- or RYE-GRASS.--This has been long in\r\ncultivation, and is usually sown with clover under a crop of spring\r\ncorn. It forms in the succeeding autumn a good stock of herbage, and the\r\nsummer following it is commonly mown for hay, or the seed saved for\r\nmarket, after which the land is usually ploughed and fallowed, to clear\r\nit of weeds, or as a preparation for Wheat, by sowing a crop of Winter\r\nTares or Turnips. The seed is about six or eight pecks per acre, and ten\r\npounds of Clover mixt as the land best suits. Although this is a very\r\nadvantageous culture for such purposes, and when the land is not to\r\nremain in constant pasture; yet it is by no means a fit grass for\r\npermanent meadow, as it exhausts the soil, and presently goes into a\r\nstate of decay for want of nourishment, when other plants natural to the\r\nsoil are apt to overpower it. There are several varieties of this\r\ngrass. Some I have seen with the flowers double, others with branched\r\npanicles; some that grow very luxuriantly, and others that are little\r\nbetter than annuals; and there is also a variety in cultivation called\r\nPACEY's Rye-grass, much sought for. But I am of opinion that nothing but\r\na fine rich soil will produce a very good crop, and that the principal\r\ndifference, after all, is owing more to cultivation or change of soil,\r\nthan to any real difference in the plant itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29. MELICA coerulea. BLUE MELIC-GRASS.--This is common on all our heaths;\r\nit appears coarse, and not a grass likely to be useful. Yet this kind is\r\nspoken of by Dr. Walker under the name of Fly-bent, who says it is one\r\nof the most productive and best grasses for sheep-feed in the Highlands\r\nof Scotland, where it grows to the height of three feet, a size to which\r\nit never attains in this part of the country. It is found in all soils,\r\nboth in dry and boggy places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30. PANICUM germanicum. GERMAN PANIC, or MOHAR.--I notice this plant\r\nhere, although it is not a native of this country; neither is it in\r\ncultivation. It was introduced some years since by Sir Thomas Tyrrwhit\r\nfrom Hungary. It is said there to be the best food of all others for\r\nhorses; and I think it might be cultivated to advantage on high sandy\r\nsoils, as a late crop of green fodder. The seeds are similar to Millet\r\n[Footnote: The Hungarian horses are remarked for their sleekness, and it\r\nis said that it is in consequence of being fed on Mohar.].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31. PANICUM crus galli. COCK'S-FOOT-PANIC-GRASS.--This plant has, I\r\nbelieve, never been recommended for cultivation; but it possesses\r\nqualities which render it worth attention: it will sometimes grow to the\r\nheight of four feet, is very fine food for cattle, and will no doubt\r\nmake excellent hay. It stands dry weather better than most other grasses\r\nI know. The seeds will not vegetate before May, and the crop not in\r\nperfection till late September. In dry soils I think it could be\r\ncultivated to advantage if sown among a crop of Tares or Rye in the\r\nautumn; and after they are cut in summer, this would spring up and be a\r\nvaluable acquisition in a dry autumn, as it would seldom fail producing\r\nan abundant crop.\r\n\r\nIt grows thick, and would tend to clear the land as a smothering crop\r\nover weeds: it is annual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32. PHALARIS arundinacea. REED CANARY-GRASS.--This is not in\r\ncultivation, but grows plentyfully on the muddy banks of the Thames; it\r\nwill also grow very well in a moderately dry soil; and I have observed\r\nthat cattle eat it when it is young. As it is early and very productive,\r\nas well as extremely hardy, I think it might become valuable as early\r\nfeed. The seeds of this plant do not readily grow, but it might easily\r\nbe introduced by planting the roots in the spring. The Striped or\r\nRibbon Grass of the flower garden is only a variety of this. See Poa\r\naquatica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n33. PHLEUM pratense. TIMOTHY-GRASS, or MEADOW-CAT'S-TAIL-GRASS.--Is very\r\ncoarse and late, and consequently not equal to many of our grasses\r\neither for hay or pasture. It has been highly recommended in America,\r\nwhere it may probably have been found to answer better than it has done\r\nwith us in cultivation. The seed used to be imported from New York, and\r\nmet with a ready sale; but I believe it is seldom imported at this\r\ntime. Dr. Walker says the seeds were taken from South Carolina (where it\r\nwas first cultivated) to that State, by one Timothy Hanson, from whence\r\nit acquired its name.\r\n\r\nThe same gentleman supposes it may be introduced into the Highlands of\r\nScotland with good effect, but is of my opinion as to its utility in\r\nEngland.--Rural Economy of the Hebrides, vol. ii. p. 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n34. PHLEUM nodosum. BULBOUS CAT'S-TAIL-GRASS. (Phleum pratense var. ?\r\nHudson.)--This affects a drier soil than the Timothy-grass: it grows\r\nvery frequently in dry thin soils, where it maintains itself against the\r\nparching sun by its bulbous roots, which lie dormant for a considerable\r\ntime, but grow again very readily when the wet weather sets in,--a\r\ncurious circumstance, which gives us an ample proof of the wise\r\ncontrivance of the great Author of Nature to fertilize all kinds of soil\r\nfor the benefit of his creatures here below. There is another instance\r\nof this in the Poa bulbosa, Bulbous Meadow-grass, which grows on the\r\nSteine at Brighton, and which I have kept in papers two years out of\r\nground, and it has vegetated afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n35. POA annua. ANNUAL MEADOW-GRASS.--This is the most general plant in\r\nall nature: it grows in almost every situation where there is any\r\nvegetation. It has been spoken of as good in cultivation, and has had\r\nthe term Suffolk grass applied to it, from its having been grown in that\r\ncounty. I have never seen it in such states, neither can I say I should\r\nanticipate much benefit to arise from a plant which is not only an\r\nannual, but very diminutive in size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36. POA aquatica. WATER MEADOW-GRASS.--This is quite an aquatic, but is\r\neaten when young by cattle, and is very useful in fenny countries: it is\r\nhighly ornamental, and might be introduced into ponds for the same\r\npurpose as Arundo Phragmites: it might also be planted with Festuca\r\nelatior and Phalaris arundinacea, in wet dug out places, where it would\r\nbe useful as fodder, and form excellent shelter for game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n37. POA fluitans. FLOTE FESCUE-GRASS.--This would be of all others the\r\nmost nutritive and best plant for feeding cattle; but it thrives only in\r\nwater. I have noticed it only because it is highly recommended by the\r\neditor of Mr. Curtis's Observations on British Grasses, 5th edit. The\r\ncattle are very fond of it; but it is not to be cultivated, unless it be\r\nin ponds, being perfectly aquatic.\r\n\r\nLinnaeus speaks of the seeds being collected and sold in Poland and\r\nGermany as a dainty for culinary purposes; but I have never seen it used\r\nhere, neither are the seeds to be collected in great quantities.\r\nStillingfleet, on the authority of a Mr. Dean, speaks highly of its\r\nmerits in a water-meadow, and also quotes Mr Ray's account of the famous\r\nmeadow at Orchiston near Salisbury. There this, as well as Poa\r\ntrivialis, most certainly is in its highest perfection; but the real and\r\ngeneral value of grasses or other plants must not be estimated by such\r\nvery local instances, when our object is to direct the student to a\r\ngeneral knowledge of the subject. See Curtis, art. Poa trivialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n38. POA trivialis. ROUGH-STALKED MEADOW-GRASS.--Those who have observed\r\nthis grass in our best watered meadows, and in other low pasture-land,\r\nhave naturally been struck with its great produce and fine herbage. In\r\nsome such places it undoubtedly appears to have every good quality that\r\na plant of this nature can possess; it is a principal grass in the\r\nfamous Orchiston meadow near Salisbury, and its amazing produce is\r\nmentioned in the Bath Agricultural Papers, vol. i. p. 94: but persons\r\nshould not be altogether caught by such appearances; for I have seen it\r\nin some lands, and such as would produce good red Clover, a very\r\ndiminutive and insignificant plant indeed.\r\n\r\nWhen persons wish to introduce it, they should carefully examine their\r\nneighbouring pastures, and see how it thrives in such places. The seeds\r\nare small, and six pounds would be sufficient for an acre, with others\r\nthat affect a similar soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n39. POA pratensis. SMOOTH-STALKED MEADOW-GRASS.--This is also a grass of\r\nconsiderable merit when it suits the soil; it affects a dry situation,\r\nand in some such places it is the principal herbage; but I have\r\ncultivated this by itself for seed in tolerably good land, and after\r\nsome time I found it matted so much by its creeping roots as to become\r\nquite unproductive both of herbage and seed. Care should therefore be\r\ntaken that only a proper portion of this be introduced. The seeds of\r\nthis and Poa trivialis are the same in bulk, and probably the same\r\nproportion should be adopted. The seeds of both species hang together by\r\na substance like to cobwebs, when thrashed, and require to be rubbed\r\neither in ashes or dry sand to separate them before sowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.--ARTIFICIAL GRASSES [Footnote: This technical term is\r\ngenerally known to farmers. It is applied to Clovers, and such plants as\r\nusually grow in pastures, and not strictly Gramina.].\r\n\r\nUnder this term are included such plants as are sown for fodder, either\r\nwith a view to form permanent pastures when mixed with the grasses, or\r\nas intermediate crops on arable land. In those cases they are usually\r\nsown with a spring crop of Oats or Barley, and the artificial grasses\r\nare protected after the harvest by the stubble left on the ground,\r\naffording the succeeding season a valuable crop, either for pasturage or\r\nhay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40. ACHILLEA Millefolium. YARROW.--This has been much recommended for\r\nsheep feed; but I observe it is frequently left untouched by them if\r\nother green herbage is found on the land. It will thrive in almost any\r\nsoil, but succeeds best in good loam. The seed used is about twelve\r\npounds per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n41. ANTHYLLIS vulneraria. KIDNEY VETCH.--This plant is not in\r\ncultivation, but it has been noticed that where it grows naturally the\r\ncows produce better milk and in greater quantity. It grows best in\r\ncalcareous soils: the seeds are large, and easily collected. This plant\r\nwell deserves attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n42. CICHORIUM Intybus. CICHORY, or BLUE SUCCORY.-Much has been said of\r\nthe good properties of this plant; and if it has them to the full extent\r\nmentioned by different authors, I wonder there is not little else than\r\nCichory grown in this country. It is very prolific, and will grow\r\nextremely quick after the scythe during the summer months: but I fear,\r\nfrom the observations I have made, that it does not possess the\r\nfattening quality it is said to have. The plant is so extremely bitter,\r\nthat although cattle may be inclined to feed on it early in the spring,\r\nyet as the season advances and other herbage more palatable is to be met\r\nwith, it is left with its beautiful blue flowers and broad foliage to\r\nrob the soil and adorn our fields, to the regret of the farmer. It grows\r\nwild in great abundance in Battersea fields, where my late friend Mr.\r\nCurtis used ludicrously to say that bad husbandry was exhibited to\r\nperfection. This plant is there continually seen in the greatest\r\nabundance, where the ground has not been lately disturbed, even under\r\nthe noses of all the half-starved cattle of that neighbourhood that are\r\nturned in during the autumn.\r\n\r\nThe root dried and ground to a powder will improve Coffee, and is\r\nfrequently drunk therewith, especially in Germany, where it is prepared\r\nin cakes and sold for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n43. HEDYSARUM Onobrychis. SAINT-FOIN.--This is certainly one of the most\r\nuseful plants of this tribe, and in the south of England is the life and\r\nsupport of the upland farmer: in such places it is the principal fodder,\r\nboth green and in hay, for all his stock. I have not observed it to be\r\ncultivated in Worcestershire or Herefordshire, where there appears to be\r\nmuch land that would grow it, and which is under much inferior crops.\r\nThe seed sown is about four bushels per acre. A mistake is often made in\r\nmentioning this plant. The newspapers, in quoting prices from Mark Lane,\r\ncall it Cinquefoil, a very different plant, (Potentilla) of rather a\r\nnoxious quality. See Gleanings on Works of Agriculture and Gardening, p.\r\n88, where a curious blunder occurs of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n44. LATHYRUS pratensis. MEADOW VETCHLING.--Abounds much in our natural\r\nmeadows, particularly in the best loamy soils, where it is very\r\nproductive and nutritious. It is not in cultivation, for the seeds do\r\nnot readily vegetate; a circumstance much to be regretted, but\r\nunfortunately the case with several of our other Tares, which would\r\notherwise be a great acquisition to our graziers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n45. LOTUS corniculatus. BIRD'S-FOOT-LOTUS.--There are several varieties\r\nof this plant; one growing on very dry chalky soils, and which in such\r\nplaces helps to make a good turf, and is much relished by cattle. The\r\nother varieties grow in marshy land, and make much larger plants than\r\nthe other. Here it is also much eaten; and I have also noticed it in\r\nhay, where it appears to be a good ingredient. As it thus appears to\r\ngrow in any situation, there is no doubt, if the seeds were collected,\r\nthat it might be cultivated with ease, and turn to good account in such\r\nland as is too light for Clover. In wet and boggy situations it becomes\r\nvery hairy, and in this state its appearance is very different from that\r\nwhich it has when growing in chalk, where it is perfectly smooth.\r\n\r\nThis plant should not be overlooked by the experimental farmer.\r\n\r\nIt is very highly spoken of in Dr. Anderson's Essays on Agriculture,\r\nunder the mistaken name of Astragalus glycophyllos, p. 489; but a truly\r\npractical account is given of it by Ellis in his Husbandry, p. 89, by\r\nthe old name Lady-Finger-Grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n46. MEDICAGO falcata. YELLOW MEDIC.--Is nearly allied to Lucerne, and is\r\nequally good for fodder; it will grow on land that is very dry, and\r\nhence is likely to become a most useful plant; its culture has, however,\r\nbeen tried but partially. Some experiments were made with this plant by\r\nThomas Le Blanc, Esq., in Suffolk, which are recorded by Professor\r\nMartyn. Martyn's Miller's Dict. art. Medicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n47. MEDICAGO polymorpha. VARIABLE MEDIC.--This is also a plant much\r\nrelished by cattle, but is not in cultivation: it is an annual, and\r\nperhaps inferior in many respects to the Nonsuch, which it in some\r\nmeasure resembles. There are many varieties of this plant cultivated in\r\nflower gardens on account of the curious shapes of the seed-pods, some\r\nhaving a distant resemblance to snails' horns, cater-pillars, &c. under\r\nwhich names they are sold in the seed-shops. It grows in sandy hilly\r\nsoils; the wild kind has flat pods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n48. MEDICAGO sativa. LUCERNE.--Too much cannot be said in praise of this\r\nmost useful perennial plant: it is every thing the farmer can wish for,\r\nexcepting that it will not grow without proper culture. It should be\r\ndrilled at eighteen inches distance, and kept constantly hoed all\r\nsummer, have a large coat of manure in winter, and be dug into the\r\nground between the drills. Six or seven pounds of seed will sow an acre\r\nin this mode.\r\n\r\nI have known Lucerne sown with Grass and Clover for forming meadow land;\r\nbut as it does not thrive well when encumbered with other plants, I see\r\nno good derived from this practice. No plant requires, or in fact\r\ndeserves, better cultivation than this, and few plants yield less if\r\nbadly managed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n49. MEDICAGO lupulina. TREFOIL, or NONSUCH.--A biennial plant, very\r\nusefully cultivated with Rye-grass and Clover for forming artificial\r\nmeadows. Trefoil when left on the ground will seed, and these will\r\nreadily grow and renew the plant successively; which has caused some\r\npersons to suppose it to be perennial. About eight or ten pounds of seed\r\nare usually sown with six or eight pecks of Rye-grass for an acre, under\r\na crop of Barley or Oats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n50. PLANTAGO lanceolata. RIB-GRASS.--This is a perennial plant, and very\r\nusefully grown, either mixed with grasses or sometimes alone: it will\r\nthrive in any soil, and particularly in rocky situations. It is much\r\ngrown on the hills in Wales, where by its roots spreading from stone to\r\nstone it is often found to prevent the soil from being washed off, and\r\nhas been known to keep a large district fertile which would otherwise be\r\nonly bare rock. Sheep are particularly fond of it. About four pounds\r\nsown with other seeds for pasture, will render a benefit in any\r\nsituation that wants it. Twenty-four pounds is usually sown on an acre\r\nwhen intended for the sole crop, and sown under corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n51. POTERIUM Sanguisorba. BURNET.--This plant grows in calcareous soils,\r\nand is in some places much esteemed. On the thin chalky soils near\r\nAlresford in Hampshire, I have observed it to thrive better than almost\r\nany other plant that is cultivated. Sheep are particularly fond of it;\r\nand I have heard it said that the flavour of the celebrated Lansdown\r\nmutton arises from the quantity of Burnet growing there. It is also the\r\nfavourite food of deer. This will grow well in any soil, and\r\nthere are few pastures without it but would be benefited by its\r\nintroduction. Twenty-five pounds per acre are sown alone: eight pounds\r\nmixed with other seeds would be sufficient to give a good plant on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n52. SANGUISORBA officinalis. GREAT CANADA BURNET.--Cattle will eat this\r\nwhen young; and it has been supposed to be a useful plant, but I do not\r\nthink it equal to Burnet.\r\n\r\nIt is perennial, and is often found wild, but has not yet been\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n53. TRIFOLIUM pratense. RED CLOVER.--This is a very old plant in\r\ncultivation, and perhaps, with little exception, one of the most useful.\r\nIt is very productive and nutritive, but soon exhausts the soil; and\r\nunless it is in particular places it presently is found to go off, which\r\nwith the grazier is become a general complaint of all our cultivated\r\nClovers. It is also well known, that if the crop is mown the plant is\r\nthe sooner exhausted.\r\n\r\nSeeds of Clover have the property of remaining long in the ground after\r\nit has become thus in a manner exhausted; and it frequently occurs that\r\nashes being laid on will stimulate the land afresh, and cause the seeds\r\nto vegetate; which has given rise to the erroneous opinion with many\r\npersons, that ashes, and particularly soap ashes, will, when sown on\r\nland, produce Clover.\r\n\r\nRed Clover is usually cultivated in stiff clays or loamy soils; and when\r\nsown alone, about sixteen or eighteen pounds of seed are used for the\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n54. TRIFOLIUM medium. ZIGZAG, or MOUNTAIN-CLOVER.--Is in some degree\r\nlike the preceeding; it produces a purple flower, and the foliage is\r\nmuch the same in appearance: but this is a much stronger perennial, and\r\ncalculated from its creeping roots to last much longer in the land. It\r\nis equally useful as a food for cattle, and does not possess that\r\ndangerous quality of causing cattle to be hove, or blown, by eating it\r\nwhen fresh and green. This plant is, however, only to be met with in\r\nupland pastures, and there in its wild state; for it does not seed very\r\nabundantly, and is not in cultivation.\r\n\r\nIn the London seed-markets we often hear of a species of red Clover\r\ntermed Cow-grass, and it generally sells for more money, and is said to\r\ndiffer in having the characters ascribed to it of this plant, namely, a\r\nhollow stem; the leaves more sharply pointed; the plant being a stronger\r\nperennial, and having the property of not causing the above-mentioned\r\ndisorder to cows that eat of it. It is said to be cultivated in\r\nHampshire, from whence I have often received the seeds which have been\r\npurchased purposely for the experiment; but on growing them, I never\r\ncould discover these differences to exist. It is a circumstance worthy\r\nnotice, that the very exact character of the Trifolium medium should\r\nthus be said to belong to the supposed variety of red Clover. I have\r\nendeavoured for the last twenty years to find out the true Cow-grass,\r\nand am of opinion that it has been from some cause mistaken for this\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe Trifolium medium is, at all events, a plant worth attention, and I\r\nthink it might be easily brought into cultivation; for although it does\r\nnot seed so abundantly as the T. pratense, I have observed it in places\r\nwhere a considerable quantity has been perfected, and where it might\r\nhave been easily collected by gathering the capsules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n55. TRIFOLIUM repens. DUTCH CLOVER.--This is not so robust a plant as\r\neither of the former kinds, but it creeps on the ground and forms a fine\r\nbottom in all lands wherever it occurs, either cultivated or wild. This\r\nhas not the property of blowing the cattle in so great a degree as the\r\nother sorts have. This disease is said to be accelerated by clover being\r\neaten whilst the dew is on it: and when green clover is intended to be\r\nused as fodder, it is always best to mow it in the heat of the day, and\r\nlet it lie till it is whithered, when it may be given to cows with\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nClover seeds of all kinds are necessary ingredients in laying down land\r\nto pasture; and the usual quantity is about twelve pounds per acre mixt\r\nin proportion at the option of the grower.\r\n\r\nThis kind remains longer in slight soils than the red does; but although\r\nboth are perennial plants, they are apt to go off, for the reason\r\npointed out under the head of T. pratense. This plant, as well as the T.\r\nmedium and other perennial kinds, is sometimes found in old pastures on\r\nloamy soils; and whenever this is the case, it is a certain indication\r\nof the goodness of the soil, and such as a judicious gardener would make\r\nchoice of for potting his exotic plants in, as he may rest assured that\r\nthe soil which will maintain clover for a succession of seasons will be\r\nfit loam for such purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n56. TRIFOLIUM procumbens. YELLOW SUCKLING.--An annual very like the\r\nNonsuch; it is a very useful plant, seeding very freely in pastures and\r\ngrowing readily, by which means it is every year renewed, and affords a\r\nfine bite for sheep and cattle. I have now and then seen the seeds of\r\nthis in the shops, but it is not common. There is a gentleman who\r\ncultivates this plant very successfully near Horsham, and who, I am\r\ninformed, states it to be the best kind of Clover for that land. It\r\ngrows very commonly amongst the herbage on Horsham Common, so that it is\r\nprobably its native habitat. The seeds are the smallest of all the\r\ncultivated Clovers, and of course less in weight will be necessary for\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n57. TRIFOLIUM ochroleucum. YELLOW CLOVER.--This is not a common plant,\r\nbut it deserves the attention of the grazier. I believe it is not in\r\ncultivation. In the garden it stands well, and is a large plant. The\r\nherbage appears to be as good as that of any other kind of Clover, and\r\nit might, if introduced, be cultivated by similar means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n58. TRIFOLIUM agrarium. HOP TREFOIL.--This is also a good plant, but not\r\nin cultivation; it is eaten by cattle in its wild state, is a perennial,\r\nand certainly deserves a trial with such persons who may be inclined to\r\nmake experiments with these plants.\r\n\r\nBuffalo Clover is a kind similar to Trifolium agrarium and Trifolium\r\nrepens, and appears to me to be a hybrid plant. This has been sometimes\r\nsent to this country from America, and is a larger plant than either. It\r\nhas, however, as far as I have grown it, the same property of exhausting\r\nthe soil as all the other species possess, and is soon found to go off:\r\nit is not in cultivation to any large extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n59. VICIA Cracca. TUFTED VETCH.--Persons who have most noticed this\r\nplant have imagined it might be introduced into cultivation. It is\r\nhardy, durable, nutritious, and productive; but, like the Yellow\r\nVetchling, the seeds do not readily vegetate; the only way to cultivate\r\nit, therefore, would be by planting out the roots; which might be done,\r\nas they are easily parted and are to be procured in great plenty in the\r\nplaces where it grows wild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n60. VICIA sativa. VETCHES, FETCH, or TARE.--A very useful and common\r\nplant, of which we have two varieties known to the farmer by the name of\r\nSpring and Winter Tares: they are both annuals. The spring variety is a\r\nmore upright growing plant, and much tenderer than the other: it is\r\nusually sown in March and April, and affords in general fine summer\r\nfodder.\r\n\r\nThe Winter Tares are usually sown at the wheat seed-time, remain all\r\nwinter, and are usually cut in the spring, generally six weeks before\r\nthe spring crop comes in. The Winter Tares are now considered a crop\r\nworth attention by the farmers near London, who sow them, and sell the\r\ncrop in small bundles in the spring at a very good price. Tares are\r\nusually sown broadcast, about three bushels and a half to the acre.\r\nPersons should be careful in procuring the true variety for the winter\r\nsowing; for I have frequently known a crop fail altogether by sowing the\r\nSpring Tares, which is a more tender variety, at that season. It should\r\nbe noticed that the seeds of both varieties are so much alike that the\r\nkinds are not to be distinguished; but the plants are easily known as\r\nsoon as they begin to grow and form stems; the Spring kind having a very\r\nupright habit, and the Winter Tares trail on the ground. It is usual for\r\npersons wanting seeds of such to procure a sample; and by growing them\r\nin a hothouse, or forcing frame, they may soon be able to ascertain the\r\nkinds. Ellis in his Husbandry says, that if ewes are fed on Tares, the\r\nlambs they produce will invariably have red flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n61. VICIA sylvatica. WOOD VETCH.--A perennial plant growing in the\r\nshade; it seems to have all the good properties in general with the\r\nother sorts of Tares; but it is not in cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n62. VICIA sepium. BUSH VETCH.--Is also a species much eaten by cattle in\r\nits wild state, but has not yet been cultivated: it nevertheless would\r\nbe an acquisition if it could be got to grow in quantity.\r\n\r\nSo much having been said of the different kinds of Tares, perhaps some\r\npersons may be inclined to think that it would be superfluous to have\r\nmore in cultivation than one or two sorts. To this I would beg leave to\r\nreply, that they do not all grow exactly in the same situations wild;\r\nand if they were cultivated, some one of them might be found to suit in\r\ncertain lands better than others; and perhaps we never shall see our\r\nagriculture at the height of improvement, till by some public-spirited\r\nmeasure all those things shall be grown for the purposes of fair\r\ncomparative experiment--an institution much wanted in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHINTS AS TO THE LAYING DOWN LAND TO PERMANENT PASTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving endeavoured to explain as nearly as possible the nature and uses\r\nof the plants which are likely to improve our meadows and pastures; I\r\nshall proceed to describe the best approved mode of sowing the land, on\r\nwhich depends, in a great measure, the future success of the\r\nhusbandman's labour.\r\n\r\nUnder the head Lolium perenne I observed the practice of sowing clovers\r\nand that grass with a crop of barley or oats, which is intended as an\r\nintermediate crop for a season or two, and then the land to be again\r\nbroken up and used for arable crops. And this is a common and useful\r\npractice; for although neither the Clover or Rye-grass will last long,\r\nyet both will be found to produce a good crop whilst the land will bear\r\nit, or until it is overpowered by the natural weeds of the ground\r\n[Footnote: It is not an uncommon opinion amongst farmers, that Rye-grass\r\nproduces Couch; and this is not extraordinary; for, if the land is at\r\nall furnished with this weed, it receives great encouragement under this\r\nmode of culture.], which renders it necessary to the farmer to break it\r\nup.\r\n\r\nI am aware of the difficulty of persuading persons (farmers in\r\nparticular) to adopt any new systems; and I have often, when speaking of\r\nthis subject amongst men of enlightened understandings, been told it\r\nwould be next to madness, to sacrifice the benefit of a crop of oats or\r\nbarley when the land is in fine tilth, and whilst we can grow grass\r\nseeds underneath it.\r\n\r\n\"To this I reply, that there is no land whatever, when left for a few\r\nmonths in a state of rest, but will produce naturally some kind of\r\nherbage, good and bad; and thus we find the industry of man excited, and\r\nthe application of the hoe and the weeder continually among all our\r\ncrops, this being essential to their welfare. I cannot help, therefore,\r\nobserving how extremely absurd it is to endeavour to form clean and good\r\npasturage under a crop hat gives as much protection to every noxious\r\nweed as to the young grass itself. Weeds are of two descriptions, and\r\neach requires a very different mode of extermination: thus, if annual,\r\nas the Charlock and Poppy, they will flower among the corn, and the\r\nseeds will ripen and drop before harvest, and be ready to vegetate as\r\nsoon as the corn is removed; and if perennial, as Thistles, Docks,\r\nCouch-grass, and a long tribe of others in this way, well known to the\r\nfarmer, they will be found to take such firm possession of the ground\r\nthat they will not be got rid of without great trouble and expense.\r\n\r\n\"Although the crop of corn thus obtained is valuable, yet when a good\r\nand permanent meadow is wanted, and when all the strength of the land is\r\nrequired to nurture the young grass thus robbed and injured, the\r\nproprietor is often at considerable expense the second year for manure,\r\nwhich, taking into consideration the trouble and disadvantage attending\r\nit, more than counterbalances the profit of the corn crop.\r\n\r\n\"To accomplish fully the formation of permanent meadows, three things\r\nare necessary: namely to clean the land, to produce good and perfect\r\nseeds adapted to the nature of the soil, and to keep the crop clean by\r\neradicating all the weeds, till the grasses have grown sufficiently to\r\nprevent the introduction of other plants. The first of these matters is\r\nknown to every good farmer,--the second may be obtained,--and the third\r\nmay be accomplished by practising the modes in which I have succeeded at\r\na small comparative expense and trouble, and which is instanced in a\r\nmeadow immediately fronting Brompton Crescent, the property of Angus\r\nMacdonald, Esq. which land was very greatly encumbered with noxious\r\nweeds of all kinds: but, by the following plan, the grasses were\r\nencouraged to grow up to the exclusion of all other plants; and though\r\nit has been laid down more than ten years, the pasturage is now at least\r\nequal to any in the county.\r\n\r\n\"Grass seeds may be sown with equal advantage both in spring and autumn.\r\nThe land above mentioned was sown in the latter end of August, and the\r\nseed made use of was one bushel of Meadow-fescue, and one of Meadow\r\nfox-tail-grass, with a mixture of fifteen pounds of white Clover and\r\nTrefoil per acre; the land was previously cleaned as far as possible\r\nwith the plough and harrows, and the seeds sown and covered in the usual\r\nway. In the month of October following, a most prodigious crop of annual\r\nweeds of many kinds having grown up, were in bloom, and covered the\r\nground and the sown grasses; the whole was then mowed and carried off\r\nthe land, and by this management all the annual weeds were at once\r\ndestroyed, as they do not spring again if cut down when in bloom. Thus,\r\nwhilst the stalks and roots of the annual weeds were decaying, the sown\r\ngrasses were getting strength during the fine weather, and what few\r\nperennial weeds were amongst them were pulled up by hand in their young\r\nstate. The whole land was repeatedly rolled, to prevent the worms and\r\nfrost from throwing the plants out of the ground; and in the following\r\nspring it was grazed till the latter end of March, when it was left for\r\nhay, and has ever since continued a good field of grass.\r\n\r\n\"Several meadows at Roehampton, belonging to the late B. Goldsmid, Esq.,\r\nwere laid down with two bushels of Meadow fescue-grass and fifteen\r\npounds of mixed Clover, and sown in the spring along with one peck and a\r\nhalf of Barley, intended as a shade to the young grasses. The crop was\r\nthus suffered to grow till the latter end of June, and then the corn,\r\nwith the weeds, was mowed and carried off the land; the ground was then\r\nrolled, and at the end of July the grasses were so much grown as to\r\nadmit good grazing for sheep, which were kept thereon for several weeks.\r\nIt should be observed, that the corn is to be mowed whilst in bloom, and\r\nwhen there is an appearance of, or immediately after rain; which will be\r\nan advantage to the grasses, and occasion them to thrive greatly.\r\n\r\n\"I sowed some fields for the same gentleman in autumn in the same way,\r\nand found them to succeed equally well.\"\r\n\r\nThe above remarks are part of a communication I gave six years since to\r\nthe Society of Arts, for which I was honoured with their prize medal;\r\nand I have great pleasure in transcribing it [Footnote: See Transactions\r\nof the Society of Arts, vol. xxvii. p. 70.], as I frequently visit the\r\nmeadows mentioned above, and have the satisfaction of hearing them\r\npronounced the best in their respective neighbourhoods. Thus are my\r\nopinions on this head borne out by twelve years experience. Let the\r\nsceptic compare this improvement with his pretended advantage of a crop\r\nof Barley.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that our agricultural efforts are intended only to\r\nassist the operations of nature, and that in all our experiments we\r\nshould consult the soil as to its spontaneous produce, from whence alone\r\nwe can be enabled to adapt, with propriety, plants to proper situations.\r\nThe kinds of selected grass-seeds that are at this time to be purchased\r\nare few, and consist of Lolium perenne, Festuca pratensis, Alopecurus\r\npratensis; Dactylis glomeratus, Cynosurus cristatus; with the various\r\nkinds of Clovers: and it is not easy to lay down any rule as to the\r\nmixture or proportion of each different kind that would best suit\r\nparticular lands. Attention however should, in all cases, be paid to the\r\nplants growing wild in the neighbouring pastures, or in similar soils,\r\nand the greater portion used of those which are observed to thrive best.\r\n\r\nIn certain instances I have mentioned particular quantities of seeds to\r\nbe mixed with others; but in general I have stated how much it would\r\nrequire to sow an acre with each kind separately; from which a person\r\nmay form a criterion, when several sorts are used, as to what quantity\r\nof each sort should be adopted. Taking into view, therefore, that\r\nnothing but a mixture of proper kinds of Grasses, &c. will make good\r\npasturage, and that our knowledge is very imperfect on this head at the\r\npresent season, we must advise that particular attention be paid to the\r\nsubject, or little good can be hoped for from all our endeavours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.--FODDER FROM LEAVES AND ROOTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe student in agriculture will find in this department a wide field for\r\nspeculation, which, although it has been greatly improved during the\r\nlast century, still affords much room for experiments.\r\n\r\nDuring the last thirty-five years I have had opportunity of observing\r\nthe great difference in the quantity of cattle brought to one of our\r\nlargest beast-markets in the south of England; and it is well known that\r\nthis has increased in a ratio of more than double; and I am informed by\r\na worthy and truly honourable prelate, who has observed the same for\r\ntwenty-five years previously, that it has nearly quadrupled. I have also\r\nmade it my business, as a subject of curiosity, to inquire if the\r\nincrease at other markets has been the same, and from all accounts I am\r\nconvinced of the affirmative. Now as we have ample proofs from the\r\nstatistical accounts of our husbandry, that less corn has not been grown\r\nin the same period, we shall naturally be inclined to give the merit of\r\nthis increase to the introduction of the Turnip husbandry, which,\r\nalthough it is now become so general, is, comparatively speaking, but in\r\nits infancy; and it is from that branch of our agriculture that has\r\nsprung the culture of the great variety of fodder of the description\r\nwhich I am now about to explain.\r\n\r\nAnd here it may not prove amiss to observe to the botanical student,\r\nshould he hereafter be destined to travel, that by making himself thus\r\nacquainted with the nature of such vegetables, he may have it in his\r\npower to render great benefit to society by the introduction of others\r\nof still superior virtues, for the use both of man and the brute\r\ncreation. When Sir Walter Raleigh undertook his expedition to South\r\nAmerica, the object of which failed, he had the good fortune from his\r\ntaste for botany to render to his country, and to the world at large, a\r\nmore essential service, by the introduction of one single vegetable,\r\nthan was ever achieved by the military exploits performed before or\r\nsince that period [Footnote: The Potatoe was introduced by Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh, on his return from the River Plate, in the year 1586.]. It has\r\nnot only been the means of increasing the wealth and strength of\r\nnations, but more than once prevented a famine in this country when\r\nsuffering from a scarcity of bread-corn and when most of the ports which\r\ncould afford us a supply were shut by the ambition of a powerful enemy.\r\n\r\n63. BRASSICA Napus. TURNIP.--Turnips afford the best feed for sheep in\r\nthe autumn and winter months. It is usual to sow them as a preparatory\r\ncrop for Barley, and now very frequently for a crop of Spring Wheat.\r\nTurnips are not easily raised but where some kind of manure is used to\r\nstimulate the land. In dry seasons the crop is often destroyed by the\r\nravages of a small beetle, which perforates the cotyledons of the\r\nplants, and destroys the crop on whole fields in a few hours.\r\n\r\nMany remedies against this evil are enumerated in our books on\r\nhusbandry. The best preventative, however, appears to be the putting\r\nmanure on the ground in a moist state and sowing the seeds with it, in\r\norder to excite the young plant to grow rapidly; for the insect does not\r\nhurt it when the rough leaf is once grown. I have this season seen a\r\nfine field of Turnips, sown mixt with dung out of a cart and ploughed in\r\nridges. The seeds which were not too deeply buried grew and escaped the\r\nfly; when scarcely a field in the same district escaped the ravages of\r\nthat insect. Turnips are sown either broad-cast or in drills. It takes\r\nabout four pounds of seed per acre in the first mode, and about half the\r\nquantity in the second.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties of turnips grown for cattle; the most\r\nstriking of which are, the White round Norfolk; the Red round ditto; the\r\nGreen round ditto; the Tankard; the Yellow. These varieties are nearly\r\nthe same in goodness and produce: the green and red are considered as\r\nrather more hardy than the others. The tankard is long-rooted and stands\r\nmore out of the ground, and is objected to as being more liable to the\r\nattack of early frosts. The yellow is much esteemed in Scotland, and\r\nsupposed to contain more nutriment [Footnote: The usual season for\r\nsowing the above varieties is within a fortnight or three weeks after\r\nMidsummer.]. The Stone and Dutch turnips are grown for culinary\r\npurposes, and are also sometimes sown after the corn is cleared, as\r\nbeing small and of early growth; these in such cases are called stubble\r\nturnips, and often in fine autumns produce a considerable quantity of\r\nherbage. For a further account of the culture &c. see Dickson's Modern\r\nHusbandry, vol. ii. p. 639.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in husbandry requiring more care than the saving seeds\r\nof most of the plants of this tribe, and in particular of the Genus\r\nBrassica. If two sorts of turnips or cabbages are suffered to grow and\r\nbloom together, the pollen of each kind will be sufficiently mixed to\r\nimpregnate each alternately, and a hybrid kind will be the produce, and\r\nin ninety-nine times out of a hundred a worse variety than either.\r\nAlthough this is generally the result of an indiscriminate mixture, yet\r\nby properly adapting two different kinds to grow together, new and\r\nsuperior varieties are sometimes produced. One gentleman having profited\r\nby this philosophy, has succeeded in producing some fine new varieties\r\nof fruits and vegetables, much to the honour of his own talents and his\r\ncountry's benefit [Footnote: See Mr Knight On the Apple-tree.]. It is\r\nwell known to gardeners that the cabbage tribe are liable to sport thus\r\nin their progeny; and to some accidental occurrence of this nature we\r\nare indebted for the very useful plant called the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n64. ROOTA-BAGA. SWEDISH TURNIP.--Which is a hybrid plant par-taking of\r\nthe turnip and cabbage, and what has within these few years added so\r\nmuch to the benefit of the grazier. This root is much more hardy than\r\nany of the turnips; it will stand our winters without suffering injury\r\nfrom frosts, and is particularly ponderous and nutritious.\r\n\r\nIt is usually cultivated as the common trunip, with this difference,\r\nthat it requires to be sown as early in some lands as the month of May,\r\nit being a plant which requires a longer time to come to maturity.\r\n\r\nEvery judicious farmer who depends on turnips for foddering his stock in\r\nthe winter, will do well to guard against the loss sometimes occasioned\r\nby the failure of his Turnips from frost and wet. Various ways of doing\r\nthis are recommended, as stacking &c. But if he has a portion of his\r\nbest land under Swedish turnip, he will have late in the winter a\r\nvaluable crop that will be his best substitute. Another advantage is\r\nthis, that it will last a fortnight longer in the spring, and\r\nconsequently be valuable on this account. The quantity of seed usually\r\nsown is the same as for the common kinds of turnip. There are two\r\nvarieties of this plant, one white and the other yellow: the latter is\r\nthe most approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n65. BRASSICA Napo Brassica. KOHLRABBI.--A hardy kind of Turnip cabbage,\r\ngrown much in Germany for fodder: it is very nutritive, and has the\r\nproperty of resisting frost better than either the turnips or\r\ncattle-cabbage. The seed and culture of this are the same as of\r\nDrum-head cabbage.\r\n\r\nThere are two varieties of this plant, the green and the purple; the\r\nlatter is generally most esteemed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n66. BRUSSELS SPROUTS.--This is a large variety of cabbage, very\r\nproductive and hardy. The culture is the same as for Cattle-cabbage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n67. BRASSICA oleracea. DRUM-HEAD CABBAGE.--This is usually sown in March\r\nand the plants put out into beds, and then transplanted into the fields;\r\nthis grows to a most enormous size, and is very profitable. About four\r\npounds of seed is sufficient for an acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEC. IV.--GRAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n73. AVENA sativa. COMMON OATS.--A grain very commonly known, of which we\r\nhave a number of varieties, from the thin old Black Oats to the fine\r\nPoland variety and the celebrated Potatoe-Oats.\r\n\r\nThese give the farmer at all times the advantage of a change of seeds, a\r\nmeasure allowed on all hands to be essential to good husbandry. The\r\nculture is various; thin soils growing the black kind in preference,\r\nwhich is remarkably hardy, where the finer sorts affecting a better soil\r\nwill not succeed. It is applicable both to the drill and broad-cast. The\r\nseed is from six pecks to four bushels per acre, and the crop from seven\r\nto fourteen quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n74. CARUM Carui. CARAWAY SEEDS.--The seeds of this are in demand both by\r\ndruggists and confectioners. It is cultivated in Kent and Essex; where\r\nit, being a biennial plant, is sown with a crop of spring corn, and left\r\nwith the stubble during the succeeding winter, and after clearing the\r\nland in the spring is left to go to seed. It requires a good hot dry\r\nsoil; but although the crop is often of great value, it so much exhausts\r\nthe land as to be hazardous culture in many light soils where the\r\ndunghill is not handy.\r\n\r\nThe seed is about ten pounds per acre, and the crop often five or six\r\nsacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n75. CORIANDRUM sativum. CORIANDER.--Is grown in the stiff lands, in\r\nEssex, and is an annual of easy but not of general culture. The seeds\r\nare used by druggists and rectifiers of spirits, and form many of the\r\ncordial drinks.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of seed and produce are similar to those of Caraway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n76. ERVUM Lens. LENTILS.--Once cultivated here for the seeds, which are\r\nused for soups; but it is furnished principally from Spain, and can at\r\nall times be purchased for less than it can be grown for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n77. HORDEUM distichon. COMMON TWO-ROWED BARLEY.--A grain now in very\r\ngeneral cultivation, and supposed to be the best kind grown for malting.\r\nThe season for sowing barley is in the spring, and the crop varies\r\naccording to soil and culture; it is sown either broad-cast, drilled, or\r\ndibbled. The quantity of seed sown is from three pecks to three bushels\r\nper acre, and the produce from three to eleven quarters.\r\n\r\nAs the process of malting may not be generally understood by that class\r\nof readers for which this work is mostly intended, I shall give a short\r\nsketch of it.--It is a natural principle of vegetation, that every seed\r\nundergoes a change before it is formed into the young plant. The\r\nsubstance of the cotyledons, which when ground forms the nutritious\r\nflower of which bread is made, changes into two particular substances,\r\ni. e. sugar and mucilage; and whilst mankind form from it the principal\r\nstaff of life as an edible commodity, the same parts of the seed in\r\nbarley are by certain means made into malt, which is only another term\r\nfor the sugar of that grain. To effect this, the barley is steeped in\r\nwater, and afterwards laid in heaps, in which state it vegetates in a\r\nfew days, and the saccharine fermentation is by that means carried on to\r\na certain pitch, when it is put on a kiln to which a fire is applied,\r\nand it is by that means dried. It is then perfect malt, and fit for the\r\npurpose of brewing.\r\n\r\nPearl and Scotch Barley, used for soup and medicinal purposes, are made\r\nfrom the grain by being put into a mill, which merely grinds off the\r\nhusk. The Pearl barley is mostly prepared in Holland, but the Scotch is\r\nmade near Edinburgh in considerable quantities. A description of an\r\nimproved Mill for this purpose is to be seen in the Edinburgh\r\nEncyclopaedia, p. 283.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n78. HORDEUM vulgare. BERE, BIG, or WINTER BARLEY.--This is a coarser\r\ngrain than the Two-rowed Barley, and hence it is not so well adapted to\r\nthe purpose of malting. It is grown on cold thin soils, being much\r\nhardier than the former.\r\n\r\nIt is now often sown in October, and in the month of May or June\r\nfollowing it is mown and taken off the land for green fodder. The plants\r\nwill notwithstanding this produce in August a very abundant crop of\r\ngrain. Hence this is a valuable mode of culture for the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe other varieties of Barley are,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n79. HORDEUM hexastichon. SIX-ROWED BARLEY.--This is also a coarse grain;\r\nand although it was once in cultivation here, it has been altogether\r\nsuperseded by the Bere, which is a better kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n80. HORDEUM zeocriton. BATTLEDORE BARLEY.--This is a fine grain, but\r\nvery tender, and not now in cultivation in this country.\r\n\r\nNAKED BARLEY. The two first species sometimes produce a variety which\r\nthrashes out of the husks similar to wheat: these are very heavy and\r\nfine grain, but they are not in cultivation: for what reason I know not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n81. PANICUM miliaceum. MILLET.--Millet is of two kinds, the brown and\r\nyellow. They are sometimes sown in this country for feeding poultry, and\r\nalso for dressing; i. e. it is divested of the husk by being passed\r\nthrough a mill, when it is equal to rice for the use of the pastrycook.\r\nThe seed used is from one to two bushels per acre. This is more commonly\r\ngrown in Italy, and on the shores of the Mediterranean sea, from which\r\nlarge quantities are annually exported to the more northern countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n82. PAPAVER somniferum. MAW-SEED.--The large white Opium Poppy is grown\r\nfor seed for feeding birds, and also for pressing the oil, which is used\r\nby painters. The heads are also used by the apothecaries; which see\r\nunder the head Medicinal Plants. About two pounds of seed to the acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n83. PHALARIS canariensis. CANARY-SEED.--This is grown mostly in the Isle\r\nof Thanet, and sent to London &c. for feeding canary and other\r\nsong-birds, and considered a very profitable crop to the farmer. It is\r\nsown in April, and the quantity of seed is about one bushel and a half\r\nper acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n84. PISUM sativum. THE PEA [Footnote: At the request of Sir John\r\nSinclair I made an experiment, from directions given by a French\r\nemigrant, of mixing Pease with urine in which had been steeped a\r\nconsiderable quantity of pigeon's dung. In the course of twenty-four\r\nhours they had swoln very much, when they were put into the ground. An\r\nequal quantity were steeped in water; and the same quantity also that\r\nhad not been steeped, were sown in three adjoining spots of land. There\r\nwas a difference in the coming up of the crops, of some days in each;\r\nbut that with the above preparation took the lead, and was by far the\r\nbest crop on the ground. This is an experiment worth attending to. It is\r\nusual to prepare wheat in a similar way, but no other grain that I have\r\never heard of.].--The Gray Hog-pea used to be the only one considered\r\nsufficiently hardy for culture in the fields; but since the improvement\r\nin our agriculture we have all the finer varieties cultivated in large\r\nquantities. The seed used is about two bushels and a half per acre, and\r\nthe produce varies from three to ten quarters.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of Peas are many, but the principal ones used in\r\nagriculture are the Early Charlton Pea; the Dwarf Marrow; the Prussian\r\nBlue. All these are dwarf kinds; and as the demand for this article in\r\ntime of war is great for the navy and army, if the farmer's land will\r\nsuit, and produce such as will boil, they will fetch a considerably\r\ngreater price in proportion.\r\n\r\nThe varieties that are found to boil are either used whole, or split,\r\nwhich is done by steeping them in water till the cotyledons swell, after\r\nwhich they are dried on a kiln and passed through a mill; which just\r\nbreaking the husk, the two cotyledons fall apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n85. POLYGONUM Fagopyrum. BUCK-WHEAT.--This is usually sown in places\r\nwhere pheasants are bred, as the seed is the best food for those birds;\r\nit is also useful for poultry and hogs. I have eaten bread and cakes\r\nmade of the flower, which are also very palatable. Two bushels are\r\nusually sown per acre. The season is May; and it is often sown on foul\r\nland in the summer, as it grows very thick on the land, and helps to\r\nclean it by smothering all the weeds. The crop does not stand on the\r\nground more than ten or twelve weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n86. SECALE cereale. RYE.--This is often grown for a spring crop of green\r\nfood, by sowing it early in the autumn, as it is very hardy and is not\r\naffected by frost. It grows fast in the spring months, and affords a\r\nvery luxuriant crop of green fodder. Tares and Rye are frequently sown\r\nmixed together for the same purpose, and the Tares find a support in the\r\nstalks of the Rye, by which means they produce a larger crop than they\r\nmake by themselves. The grain is the next in estimation to Wheat, and is\r\nfrequently used for making bread. The quantity sown per acre is the same\r\nas Wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n87. SINAPIS nigra. BLACK MUSTARD.--This is grown in Essex in great\r\nquantities for the seeds, which are sold to the manufacturers of flower\r\nof mustard, and is considered better flavoured, stronger, and capable of\r\nkeeping better, than the white kind for such purpose. It is also in use\r\nfor various medicinal preparations; which see. About two bushels of seed\r\nsown broad-cast are sufficient for an acre.\r\n\r\nThis plant affords another striking instance of the care of Providence\r\nin preserving the species of the vegetable kingdom, it being noticed in\r\nthe Isle of Ely and other places, that wherever new ditches are thrown\r\nout, or the earth dug to any unusual depth, the seeds of Black Mustard\r\nimmediately throw up a crop. In some places it has been proved to have\r\nlain thus embalmed for ages.\r\n\r\nFlower of mustard, which is now become so common on our tables, and\r\nwhich is an article of very considerable trade, is but a new\r\nmanufacture. A respectable seedsman who lived in Pall-Mall was the first\r\nwho prepared it in this state for sale. The seeds of the white sort had\r\nbeen used to be bruised in a mortar and eaten sometimes as a condiment,\r\nbut only in small quantities.\r\n\r\nWhen used fresh it is weak, and has an unpleasant taste; but after\r\nstanding a few hours the essential oil unites with the water which is\r\nused, and it then becomes considerably stronger, and the flavour is\r\nimproved. It is prepared by drying the seeds on a kiln and grinding them\r\nto a powder. As this article is become of considerable importance from\r\nthe demand, it has occasioned persons to speculate in its adulteration,\r\nwhich is now I believe often practised. Real flower of mustard will bear\r\nthe addition of an equal quantity of salt without its appearing too much\r\nin the taste. In an old work, Hartman's treasure of Health, I find it to\r\nhave been practised by a noble lady of that time to make mustard for\r\nkeeping, with sherry wine with the addition of a little sugar, and\r\nsometimes a little vinegar. Query, Is this, with the substitution of a\r\ncheaper wine, the secret of what is called Patent Mustard?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n88. TRITICUM aestivum. SPRING WHEAT.--Wheat is a grain well known in most\r\ncountries in Europe. It has been in cultivation for many ages. This\r\nspecies was introduced some years ago from the Barbary coast, and has\r\nbeen found very beneficial for sowing in the spring, when it often\r\nproduces a large crop. It takes a shorter time to come to maturity than\r\nthe other sorts; and as it is a more profitable crop to the farmer on\r\ngood soils than Barley, it is frequently sown after Turnips are over.\r\nThis has, perhaps, been one of the best improvements in Grain husbandry\r\nthat was ever introduced, as it gives the grower great advantages which\r\nhe could not have under the common culture of Wheat at the usual\r\nseed-time. This is little different in appearance from the Common White\r\nWheat. But there was a small variety of it with rounder grains sent to\r\nthe Board of Agriculture from the Cape of Good Hope about the year 1801,\r\nof which I saved a small quantity of seeds which was distributed among\r\nthe members; and I have lately seen a sample of it in the hands of a\r\ngentleman in Devonshire, who speaks very highly of it as producing a\r\nlarge crop in a short time, and that the flower was so much esteemed,\r\nthat the millers gave him a higher price for it than the finest samples\r\nat market of the other kinds would sell for. I believe this variety is\r\nvery scarce. It is now twelve years since I grew it, from which what I\r\nsaw, and all other in cultivation, if any there are, have sprung.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n89. TRITICUM compositum. EGYPTIAN WHEAT.--This is a species with\r\nbranched ears, and commonly having as many as three and four divisions.\r\nIt is much cultivated in the eastern countries, but has not been found\r\nto answer so well in this country as the common cultivated species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n90. TRITICUM hybernum. COMMON WHEAT.--Of this grain we have a number of\r\nvarieties, which are grown according to the fashion of countries,\r\ndiffering in the colour of the ear and also of the grain. The most\r\nesteemed sorts are the Hertfordshire White and the Essex Red Wheat,\r\nwhich are both much cultivated and equally esteemed. The season for\r\ngrowing these kinds is usually September and October. The drill, dibble,\r\nand broad-cast modes are all used, as the land and convenience of the\r\nfarmer happen to suit, and the produce varies accordingly; as does also\r\nthe quantity of seed sown. From two pecks to two bushels and a half are\r\nsown on an acre.\r\n\r\nWheat is liable to the ravages of many terrestrious insects which attack\r\nits roots; and also some very curious diseases. One of these has been\r\nvery clearly elucidated by our munificent patron of science, Sir Joseph\r\nBanks, in the investigation of a parasitical plant which destroys the\r\nblood of the stalk and leaves, renders the grain thin, and in some cases\r\nquite destroys the crop, which has done that gentleman's penetration\r\ngreat credit [Footnote: Sir Joseph Banks On the Blight in Corn.]. An\r\nequally extraordinary disease is the Smut, which converts the\r\nfarinaceous parts of the grain to a black powder resembling smut: a\r\ncirumstance too well known to many farmers. Those who wish to consult\r\nthe remedies recommended against this, may refer to The Annals of\r\nAgriculture, and most other books on the subject. It is usual with\r\nfarmers to mix the Wheat with stale urine or brine, and to dry it by\r\nsifting it with slaked lime, which has the effect of causing it to\r\nvegetate quickly, and to prevent the attacks of many insects when the\r\nseed is first put into the ground. This is considered as productive of\r\ngreat benefit to the crop; but it is also to be remarked, that it is\r\nalmost the only grain that is ever prepared with this mixture, although\r\nit might be applied with equal propriety to all others. See article\r\nPisum sativum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n91. TRITICUM turgidum. CONE WHEAT.--This a fine grain, and cultivated\r\nmuch in the strong land in the Vale of Evesham, where it is found to\r\nanswer better than any other sorts. It is distinguished by the square\r\nand thick spike, and having a very long arista or beard.\r\n\r\nThe following sorts of Wheat are mentioned as being in cultivation. But\r\nI have not seen them, neither do I think any of them equal to the sorts\r\nenumerated above:\r\n\r\nTriticum nigrum. BLACK-GRAINED WHEAT. Triticum polonicum. POLISH WHEAT.\r\nTriticum monococcon. ONE-GRAINED WHEAT. Triticum Spelta. SPELT WHEAT.\r\n\r\nBesides the use of Wheat for bread and other domestic purposes, large\r\nquantities are every season consumed in making starch, which is the pure\r\nfecula of the grain obtained by steeping it in water and beating it in\r\ncoarse hempen bags, by which means the fecula is thus caused to exude\r\nand diffuse through the water. This, from being mixed with the\r\nsaccharine matter of the grain, soon runs into the acetous fermentation,\r\nand the weak acid thus formed by digesting on the fecula renders it\r\nwhite. After setting, the precipitate is washed several times, and put\r\nby in square cakes and dried on kilns. These in drying part into flakes,\r\nwhich gives the form to the starch of the shops.\r\n\r\nStarch is soluble in hot water, and becomes of the nature of gum. It is\r\nhowever insoluble in cold water, and on this account when pulverized it\r\nmakes most excellent hair-powder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n92. Vicia Faba. THE BEAN.--Several kinds of Beans are cultivated by\r\nfarmers. The principal are the Horse-Bean or Tick-Bean; the Early\r\nMazagan; and the Long-pods. Beans grow best in stiff clayey soils, and\r\nin such they are the most convenient crop. The season for planting is\r\neither the winter or spring month, as the weather affords opportunity.\r\nThey are either drilled, broad-cast sown, or put in by the dibble, which\r\nis considered not only the most eligible mode but in ge-neral affording\r\nthe best crops. The seed is from one to three bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n93. ZEA Mays. INDIAN CORN, or MAIZE. In warmer climates, as the South of\r\nFrance, and the East and West Indies, this is one of the most useful\r\nplants; the seeds forming good provender for poultry, hogs and cattle,\r\nand the green tops excellent fodder for cattle in general. I once saw a\r\nsmall early variety, that produced a very good crop, near Uxbridge; but\r\nI believe it is not in cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. V.--MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n94. CANNABIS sativa. HEMP.--This plant is cultivated in some parts of\r\nthis country. It is usually sown in March, and is fit to harvest in\r\nOctober. It is then pulled up and immersed in water; when the woody\r\nparts of the stalks separating from the bark, which sloughs off and\r\nundergoes a decomposition by which the fibres are divided, it is then\r\ncombed (hackled), dried, and reduced to different fineness of texture,\r\nand spun for various purposes. It requires good land, and the seed is\r\nusually two bushels and a half per acre.\r\n\r\nThe seed, which ripens about the time the hemp is pulled, is useful for\r\nfeeding birds and poultry, and very nourishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n95. DIPSACUS Fullonum. FULLER'S TEAVEL.--The heads of this plant are\r\nused for combing kerseymeres and finer broad cloths. The heads are\r\ngenerally fit to cut about the latter end of August, and are then\r\nseparated and made up into bundles, and sold to the clothiers. The large\r\nheads are called Kings; the next size Middlings; and the smaller\r\nMinikins. The reason they are separated before sending to market is,\r\nthat the large and small will not fit together on the frame in which\r\nthey are fixed to the water-wheel, so that it is usual for the\r\nproprietor of the fulling-mills to purchase all of either one or the\r\nother size. The crop is considered very valuable, but the culture is\r\nconfined to a small district in Somersetshire. The plant is biennial,\r\nand is usually sown in May, and the crop kept hoed during that season.\r\nIn the following spring the plants bloom, and when the seeds are ripe\r\nthe heads are fit for cutting; when they are assorted as above for the\r\ndealers. Three pounds of seed are used to an acre, and the plants at the\r\nlast stirring are left from two feet to two feet and a half apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n96. HUMULUS Lupulus. THE HOP.--The Hop is cultivated for brewing, being\r\nthe most wholesome bitter we have, though the brewers are in the habit\r\nof using other vegetable bitters, which are brought from abroad and sold\r\nat a much cheaper rate. There is, however, a severe penalty on using any\r\nother than Hops for such purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Hops are distinguished by several varieties grown in Kent,\r\nWorcestershire, and at Farnham. The last place produces the best kind.\r\nFor its culture more at length see Agriculture of Surry, by Mr.\r\nStevenson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n97. ISATIS tinctoria. WOAD.--Is cultivated in the county of\r\nSomersetshire. It is used, after being prepared, for dyeing &c. It is\r\nsaid to be the mordant used for a fine blue on woollen. The foliage,\r\nwhich is like Spinach, is gathered during the summer months, and steeped\r\nin vats of water. After some time a green fecula is deposited in the\r\nbottom of the water, which is washed, and made into cakes and sold for\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nIt is a perennial plant, and found wild in great abundance near\r\nGuildford, where great quantities might be gathered for use, and where a\r\ngreat deal of the seed could be collected. Its culture is very similar\r\nto that of the Teazle, with this difference, it requires the hoe at work\r\nconstantly all the summer months.\r\n\r\nThe two plants Weld and Woad from the similarity of names are frequently\r\nconfounded with each other, and some of the best agricultural writers\r\nhave fallen into this error. They are two very different plants, and\r\nought to be well defined, being each of them of very material\r\nconsequence in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n98. LINUM usitatissimum. FLAX, or LINT-SEED.--Is grown for the purpose\r\nof making cloth, and has been considered a very profitable crop. The\r\nculture and management is similar to that of Hemp, and the seeds are in\r\ngreat demand for pressing. Lintseed oil, which it produces, is much used\r\nby painters, and is the only vegetable oil that is found fit for such\r\npurposes in general. The seeds are of several uses to the farmer; a tea\r\nis made of it, and mixed with skimmed milk, for fattening house-lambs\r\nand calves. Oxen are often fattened on the seed itself; but the cakes\r\nafter the oil is expressed are a very common and most excellent article\r\nfor fattening both black cattle and sheep. These are sold at from 10 l.\r\nto 16 l. per thousand.\r\n\r\nIt will require three bushels of Flax-seed for one acre, as it must be\r\nsown thick on the land. Lintseed cake has been used also for manure; and\r\nI have seen fine crops of Turnips where it has been powdered and sown in\r\nthe drills with the seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n99. RESEDA luteola. DYER'S-WEED, or WELD.--Is often confounded with\r\nWoad, but is altogether a very different plant. Weld is cultivated on\r\nthe chalky hills of Surry, being sown under a crop of Barley, and the\r\nsecond year cleaned by hoeing, and then left to grow till it blooms,\r\nwhen it is pulled and tied up in small bundles, and after drying is sent\r\nto market, where it is purchased for dyeing yellow, and is in great\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n100. RUBIA tinctoria. MADDER.--This very useful dyeing drug used to be\r\ngrown in this country in considerable quantities, but it is not\r\ncultivated here at the present time. The principal part of what is used\r\nnow is brought from Holland, and affords a considerable article of trade\r\nto the Dutch farmers. Those who wish to be informed of the mode of\r\nculture may consult Professor Martyn's edition of Miller's Dictionary.\r\n\r\nSome years since Sir Henry Englefield, Bart., obtained a premium from\r\nthe Society of Arts for the discovery of a fine tint drawn from Madder,\r\ncalled the Adrianople red. It was found that it was to be obtained from\r\na variety of the Rubia brought from Smyrna; and Mr. Smyth, our consul at\r\nthat city, was prevailed on by Dr. Charles Taylor to procure seeds from\r\nthence, which the Society did me the honour of committing to my care;\r\nand I have now a considerable stock of that kind, from whence I have\r\nmyself obtained the same beautiful and superior tint. See Trans. Soc.\r\nArts. vol. 27, p. 40.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n101. ULEX europaeus. FURZE, GORSE, or WHIN.--Is used in husbandry for\r\nfences, and is also much cultivated for fuel for burning lime, heating\r\novens, &c. Cattle and sheep relish it much; but it cannot be eaten by\r\nthem except when young, in consequence of its strong spines; to obviate\r\nwhich an implement has been invented for bruising it. When it grows wild\r\non our waste land, it is common to set it on fire in the summer months,\r\nand the roots and stems will throw up from the ground young shoots,\r\nwhich are found very useful food for sheep and other animals. It is\r\nreadily grown from seeds, six pounds of which will be enough for an acre\r\nof land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTS USEFUL IN THE ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VI.--BRITISH TREES AND SHRUBS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n102. ACER Pseudo-Platanus. SYCAMORE.--The wood of this tree is soft and\r\nof little use, unless it is for the turners' purposes, who make boxes\r\nand other small toys of it. It is not of value as timber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n103. ACER campestre. THE MAPLE.--Before the introduction of Mahogany and\r\nother fine woods the Maple was the principal wood used for all kinds of\r\ncabinet work, and was much esteemed: the knobs which grow on those trees\r\nin an old state afforded the most beautiful specimens, and according to\r\nEvelyn were collected by the curious at great prices. The Maple trees in\r\nthis country are none of them at the present day old enough to afford\r\nthat fine-veined variegation in the timber which is alluded to in this\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n104. ARBUTUS Unedo. THE STRAWBERRY-TREE.--Is a native of the islands in\r\nthe celebrated Lake of Killarney in Ireland, where it grows to a large\r\nsize. We know of no particular use to which it is applied. It is however\r\none of our most ornamental evergreen shrubs, producing beautiful\r\nflowers, which vary from transparent white to deep red, in the winter\r\nmonths, at which season also the fruit appears; which taking twelve\r\nmonths to come to maturity affords the singular phaenomenon in plants, of\r\nhaving lively green leaves, beautiful flowers, and fruit as brilliant as\r\nthe richest strawberry, in the very depth of our winter. We have a fine\r\nvariety of this plant with scarlet blossoms, and also one with double\r\nflowers, both of which are singularly ornamental to the shrubbery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n105. ARBUTUS Uva Ursi. BEAR-BERRIES.--A small trailing plant of great\r\nrepute as a medicine, but of no use in any other respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n106. BERBERIS vulgaris. BARBERRY.--This has long been cultivated in\r\ngardens for its fruit, which is a fine acid, and it is used as a\r\nconserve, and also for giving other sweeter fruits a flavour. The common\r\nwild kind has stones in the fruit, which renders it disagreeable to eat.\r\nThere is a variety without stones called the Male Barberry, which is\r\npreferred on this account.\r\n\r\nThis tree is subject to a disease in the summer, caused apparently from\r\na yellow fungus growing on the leaves and young shoots; and it is said\r\nthat where it grows near corn fields it imparts its baneful influence to\r\nthe grain, for which reason it is recommended in some of our books on\r\nagriculture to exterminate the trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n107. BETULA alba. BIRCH-TREE.--Is in great use and of considerable value\r\non some estates for making brooms, and the timber for all purposes of\r\nturnery-ware and carving. The sap of the Birch-tree is drawn by\r\nperforating the bark in the early state of vegetation. It is fermented,\r\nand makes a very pleasant and potent beverage called Birch Wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n108. BETULA Alnus. ALDER-TREE.--This is a valuable tree for planting in\r\nmoors and wet places. The wood is used for making clogs, pattens, and\r\nother such purposes; and the bark for dyeing and manufacturing some of\r\nthe finer kinds of leather. This wood is of considerable value for\r\nmaking charcoal for gunpowder. In charring it a considerable quantity of\r\nacetic acid is extracted, which is of great value for the purpose of\r\nbleaching, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n109. BUXUS sempervirens. BOX-TREE.--The wood of Box is of great value\r\nfor musical instruments, and for forming the handles of many tools:\r\nbeing very hard, it admits of a fine polish. This tree is growing in\r\nquantity at Box-hill in Surry, and has given name to that place.\r\n\r\nThis was planted by a late Duke of Norfolk, and has succeeded so well,\r\nthat the wood has been cut twice, and sold each time for treble the\r\nvalue of the fee-simple of the land.\r\n\r\nIt forms a better cover for game than any other plant; and being very\r\nbitter, is not liable to be destroyed by any animal eating it down. An\r\ninfusion of the leaves is frequently given as a vermifuge with good\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThere is a smaller variety of this, much used for making edging to\r\ngravel walks in gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n110. CARPINUS Betulus. THE HORNBEAM.--This grows to a large tree, but is\r\nnot of much account as timber: it is however very useful in forming\r\nornamental fences, and is well adapted to this purpose from the tendency\r\nof its young branches to grow thick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n111. CLEMATIS Vitalba. TRAVELLER'S JOY.--A beautiful creeping shrub very\r\nuseful to the farmers for making shackles for gates and hurdles, or\r\nwiths for tying faggots and other articles. Whenever this plant is found\r\nin the hedges, &c. it is a certain indication of a ckalky under stratum\r\nin the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n112. CORNUS sanguinea. DOG-WOOD.--This is planted in pleasuregrounds as\r\nan ornamental shrub, and from the red appearance of the wood in the\r\nwinter forms a beautiful constrast in plantations. It is also used by\r\nbutchers for making skewers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n113. CORYLUS Avellana. THE HAZEL.--Is a well known shrub of large growth\r\nproducing nuts, which are much admired. The Filbert is an improved\r\nvariety of this plant. The farmers in Kent are the best managers of\r\nFilberts, and it is the only place where they are grown with any\r\ncertainty; which appears to be owing principally to the trees being\r\nregularly pruned of the superfluous wood. It is performed in the month\r\nof March when the plants are in bloom, and is the only time when the\r\nfruit-bearing wood can be distinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n114. CRATAEGUS Aria. WHITE BEAM-TREE.--Is a beautiful tree producing very\r\nhard wood, and is much in esteem for cogs of millwork and various other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n115. CRATAEGUS Oxyacantha. THE QUICKSET, or WHITE-THORN.--This is in\r\ngreat request for making fences, and is the best plant we know for such\r\npurposes if properly managed. It is readily propagated by sowing the\r\nhips, or fruit, which does not readily grow the first season; it is\r\ntherefore usual to bury them mixed with saw-dust, or sand, one year, and\r\nthen to sow them in beds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n116. DAPHNE Laureola. SPURGE- or WOOD-LAUREL.--Is used in medicine;\r\nwhich see.\r\n\r\nWe have many species of Daphne which are very ornamental to our\r\nshrubberies and green-houses: these are propagated principally by\r\ngrafting; and the Wood-Laurel being hardy and of ready growth forms the\r\nstock principally used. It is readily propagated by seeds, which in\r\nthree years will make plants large enough for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe plant in all its parts is excessively acrid. I remember a man being\r\npersuaded to take the leaves reduced to powder, as a remedy for\r\nSyphilis, and he died in consequence in great agony in a few hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n117. DAPHNE Mezerium. MEZERION.--Is a very beautiful shrub, and is one\r\nof the earliest productions of Flora, often exhibiting its brilliant\r\nscarlet flowers in January and February. We have also a white variety of\r\nthis shrub in the gardens. The bark and roots are extremely acrimonious,\r\nand are used in medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n118. ERICA vulgaris. THE COMMON HEATH, HEATHER, or LING.---This\r\nspontaneous produce of most of our sandy waste lands is of much usin\r\nrural oeconomy.\r\n\r\nIt is of considerable value for making brooms, and affords food to\r\nsheep, goats, and other animals; particularly to the grouse and\r\nheath-cock. The branches of heath placed upright in a wooden frame form\r\nthe couch of repose to the brave Highlander. It is also stated that an\r\nexcellent beverage was brewed from the tops of this plant, but the art\r\nof making it is now lost. This is the most common of the species, but\r\nall the others have similar properties. They are very ornamental plants.\r\nA numerous variety of heaths are brought from the Cape of Good Hope, and\r\nafford great pleasure to the amateur of exotic plants, being the\r\ngreatest ornaments to our green-houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n119. EUONYMUS europaeus. SPINDLE-TREE.--An ornamental shrub. The wood is\r\nin great request for making skewers for butchers, as it does not impart\r\nany unpleasant taste to the meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n120. FAGUS Castanea. THE SPANISH CHESNUT.--This tree produces timber\r\nsimilar to oak in point of durability, and the bark also contains a\r\nconsiderable quantity of tannin. The Chesnut was in greater plenty in\r\nthis country many years ago than at the present day; large forests are\r\nrepresented to have been in the neighbourhood of London; and we are led\r\nto believe such may have been the case, as many of the old buildings\r\nwhen examined have been found to be built of this timber. The fruit is\r\nused as a dainty at table; but the variety which is brought from\r\nPortugal and Spain is much larger than what are grown in this country.\r\nThe large kind imported from those countries is grafted, and kept on\r\npurpose for the fruit. It is an improvement to graft this variety by\r\ntaking the scions from trees in bearing, and they will produce fruit in\r\na few years and in a dwarf state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n121. FAGUS sylvatica. THE BEECH.--The timber of the Beech is valuable\r\nfor making wheels, and is applied to many other useful purposes in\r\ndomestic oeconomy. The seeds of the Beech are very useful for fattening\r\nhogs.\r\n\r\nThis tree affords many beautiful varieties in foliage, the handsomest of\r\nwhich is the Copper Beech, whose purple leaves form a fine contrast in\r\ncolour with the lively green of the common sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n123. FRAXINUS excelsior. THE ASH.--The wood of the Ash is considered the\r\nbest timber for all purposes of strong husbandry utensils. The wheels\r\nand axle-trees of carriages, the shafts for carts, and the cogs for\r\nmill-work, are principally made of this timber. The young wood when gown\r\nin coppices is useful for hop-poles, and the small underwood is said to\r\nafford the best fuel of any when used green. Coppice-land usually sells\r\nfor a comparatively greater price according as this wood prevails in\r\nquantity, on account of its good quality as fuel alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n124. HEDERA Helix. IVY.--A common plant in woods, and often planted in\r\nshady places to hide walls and buildings. The leaves are good food for\r\ndeer and sheep in winter. The Irish Ivy, which was brought from that\r\ncountry, is a fine variety with broad leaves. It was introduced by Earl\r\nCamden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n125. HIPPOPHAE Rhamnoides. SEA BUCKTHORN.--This is a scarce shrub; but\r\nis very useful as a plant for forming shelter on the hills near the\r\nsea-coast, it having been found to stand the sea-breeze better than any\r\nplant of the kind that is indigenous to this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n126. ILEX aquifolium. HOLLY.--A well-known evergreen of singular beauty,\r\nof which we have many varieties, both striped, and of different colours\r\nin the leaf. Birdlime is made from the inner bark of this tree, by\r\nbeating it in a running stream and leaving it to ferment in a close\r\nvessel. If iron be heated with charcoal made of holly with the bark on,\r\nthe iron will be rendered brittle; but if the bark be taken off, this\r\neffect will not be produced. Ray's Works and Travels by Scott.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n127. JUNIPERUS communis. JUNIPER.--An evergreen shrub, very common on\r\nwaste lands. The berries are used in preparing the well-known spiritous\r\nliquor gin, and have been considered of great use in medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n128. LIGUSTRUM vulgare. PRIVET.--A shrub of somewhat humble growth, very\r\nuseful for forming hedges where shelter is wanted more than strength. It\r\nbears clipping, and forms a very ornamental fence. There is a variety of\r\nthis with berries, and another nearly evergreen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n129. MESPILUS germanica. THE MEDLAR.--Is cultivated for its fruit, and\r\nof which we have a variety called the Dutch Medlar; it is larger than\r\nour English one, but I do not think it better flavoured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n130. PINUS sylvestris. THE SCOTCH FIR.--A very useful tree in\r\nplantations for protecting other more tender sorts when young. It is\r\nalso now very valuable as timber:--necessity, the common parent of\r\ninvention, has taught our countrymen its value. When foreign deal was\r\nworth twenty pounds per load, they contrieved to raise the price of this\r\nto about nine or ten pounds, and it was then thought proper for use;\r\nbefore which period, and when it could be bought for little money, it\r\nwas deemed only fit for fuel. On the South Downs I know some plantations\r\nof this tree, which have been sold, after twenty-five years growth, at a\r\nprice which averaged a profit of twenty shillings per annum per acre, on\r\nland usually let for sheep-pasture at one shilling and six-pence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n131. POPULUS alba. WHITE POPLAR. This is a very ornamental tree. The\r\nleaves on the under surface are of a fine white, and on the reverse of a\r\nvery dark green; and when growing on large trees are truly beautiful, as\r\nevery breath of air changes the colour as the leaves move. The wood of\r\nall the species of poplar is useful for boards, or any other purposes if\r\nkept dry. It is much in demand for floor-boards for rooms, it not\r\nreadily taking fire; a red-hot poker falling on a board, would burn its\r\nway through it, without causing more combustion than the hole through\r\nwhich it passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n132. POPULUS monilifera. CANADA POPLAR.--This is also known by the name\r\nof BLACK ITALIAN POPLAR, but from whence it had this name I do not know.\r\nThis species, which is the finest of all the kinds, grows very commonly\r\nin woods and hedges in many parts of Worcestershire and Herefordshire,\r\nwhere it reaches to prodigious sizes. Perhaps no timber is more useful\r\nthan this; it is very durable, and easy to be converted to all purposes\r\nin building. The floors of a great part of Downton Castle, the seat of\r\nR. Payne Knight, Esq. are laid with this wood, which have been used\r\nforty years and are perfectly sound. Trees are now growing on his estate\r\nwhich are three and four feet in diameter. I have one growing in my\r\nBotanic garden which is eight years old, and measures upwards of six\r\ncubic feet of timber. The parent of this tree which grew at Brompton I\r\nconverted into boards. It was nineteen years growing; and when cut down\r\nit was worth upwards of fourteen pounds, rating it at the then price of\r\ndeal, for which it was a good substitute. Some fine specimens of this\r\ntree are also to be seen at Garnins, the seat of Sir J. G. Cotterell,\r\nBart. the present worthy member for the county of Hereford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n133. PRUNUS domestica. THE COMMON PLUM-TREE.--This is the parent of our\r\nfruit of this name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n134. PRUNUS Cerasus. WILD CHERRY-TREE.--Is the parent of our fine\r\ncherries. It is cultivated much in Scotland for the timber, which is\r\nhard, and of use for furniture and other domestic purposes. It is the\r\nbest and most lasting stock for grafting on. Persons who are about to\r\nplant this fruit would do well to inquire into the nature of the stock,\r\nas no fruit-tree is so liable to disease and become gummy as cherries\r\nare, and that is often much owing to the improved kinds being sown for\r\nstocks, which are of a more tender texture and of course less hardy than\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n135. PRUNUS insititia. SLOE-TREE.--Is of little use except when it\r\noccurs in fences. The fruit is a fine acid, and is much used by the\r\ncommon people, mixed with other fruits less astringent and acid, to\r\nflavour made wines. It is believed that much Port wine is improved by\r\nthe same means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n136. PYRUS communis. PEAR-TREE.--This is the parent of all our fine\r\nvarieties of this fruit, and is used as the stock for propagating them;\r\nthese are raised from seeds for that purpose. The wood of the Peartree\r\nis in great esteem for picture frames, it receiving a stain better than\r\nalmost any other timber known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n137. PYRUS Malus. CRAB-TREE.--A tree of great account, as being the\r\nparent of all our varieties of apples, and is the stock on which the\r\nfine varieties are usually grafted. A dwarf variety of this tree, called\r\nthe Paradise Apple, is used for stocks for making dwarf apple trees for\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\nThe juice of the Crab is called verjuice, which is in considerable\r\ndemand for medicinal and other purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n138. QUERCUS robur. THE OAK.--Is a well known tree peculiar to Great\r\nBritain, and of the greatest interest to us as a nation. It is of very\r\nslow growth; but the timber is very strong and lasting, and hence it is\r\nused for building our shipping. The bark is supposed to contain more\r\ntannin than that of any other tree, and is valuable on that account. The\r\nacorns, or fruit, are good food for hogs, which are observed to grow\r\nvery fat when turned into the forests at the season when they are ripe.\r\nThe tree is raised from the acorn, which grows very readily.\r\n\r\nWe have accounts of Oak trees growing to great ages, and to most\r\nenormous sizes. One instance is mentioned by Evelyn, of one growing at\r\nCowthorp, near Weatherby, in 1776, which within three feet of the ground\r\nwas sixteen yards in circumference, and its height about eighty-five\r\nfeet. Hunter's Evelyn's Sylva, p. 500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n139. ROSA rubiginosa. SWEET-BRIAR.--Is a very fragrant shrub, for which\r\nit has long been cultivated in the gardens. There are several varieties\r\nin the nurseries; as the Double-flowering, Evergreen, &c. which are much\r\nesteemed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n140. RUBUS Idaeus. THE RASPBERRY.--Produces a well known fruit in great\r\nesteem, and of considerable use both as food and for medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n141. RUBUS fruticosus. BRAMBLE.--Produces a black insipid fruit, but\r\nwhich is used by the poor people for tarts and to form a made wine: when\r\nmixt with the juice of sloes it is rendered very palatable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n142. RUBUS caesius.--Is a dwarf kind of bramble, and produces fruit of a\r\npleasant acid, and where it grows in plenty it is used by the poor\r\npeople for pies and other purposes of domestic oeconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n143. SALIX Russelliana. THE WILLOW.--No trees in this country are of\r\nmore use than the species of this genus: many are grown for\r\nbasket-makers in form of osiers, and other larger sorts serve for\r\nstakes, rails, hop-poles, and many other useful purposes. The bark of\r\nseveral species has been considered as useful for tanning leather. The\r\ncharcoal of the Willow is also much in demand for making gunpowder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n144. SALIX viminalis. THE OSIER.--These are cultivated in watery places\r\nfor making baskets, which are become a profitable article, and are the\r\nshoots of one season's growth cut every winter. The species best adapted\r\nto this purpose, besides the common osier, are\r\n\r\nThe Salix vitellina. Golden Willow. The Salix monandria. Monandrous\r\nWillow. The Salix triandria. Triandrous Willow. The Salix mollissima.\r\nSilky-leaved Willow. The Salix stipularis. Auriculated Osier. The Salix\r\npurpurea. Bitter Purple Willow. The Salix Helix. Rose Willow. The Salix\r\nLambertiana. Boyton Willow. The Salix Forbyana. Basket Osier. The Salix\r\nrubra. Green Osier. The Salix nigricans. Dark Purple Osier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n145. SAMBUCUS nigra. ELDER.--The timber of the Elder is useful for\r\nmaking musical instruments, and the berries made into wine and fermented\r\nmake a useful and valuable beverage. A variety with green berries is\r\nmuch esteemed for wine also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n146. SORBUS Aucuparia. QUICKEN-TREE, or MOUNTAIN-ASH.--In this part of\r\nBritain we usually find this tree in plantations, where it is very\r\nornamental; and the berries, which are of a fine scarlet, are the food\r\nof many species of birds. The wood is also useful for posts, &c. and is\r\nconsidered lasting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147. SORBUS domestica. TRUE SERVICE.--Produces a fruit much like the\r\nMedlar, and when ripe is in great esteem. The only tree in this country\r\nin a wild state, is growing in Bewdley Forest, Worcester-shire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n148. SPARTIUM Scoparium. BROOM.--Is a very ornamental plant, and is used\r\nfor making besoms. It was once considered as a specific in the cure of\r\ndropsy, but is now seldom used for medicial purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n149. STAPHYLEA pinnata. BLADDER-NUT.--This is not a common plant in this\r\ncountry. I know of no other use to which it is applied, but its being\r\ncultivated in nurseries and sold as an ornamental shrub. The\r\nseed-vessel, from whence it takes its name, is a curious example of the\r\ninflated capsule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n150. TAMARIX gallica. A shrub of large growth; and being less affected\r\nby the sea breeze than any others, is useful to form a shelter in\r\nsituations where the bleak winds will not admit of trees of more tender\r\nkinds to flourish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n151. TAXUS baccata. THE YEW.--Was formerly much esteemed for making\r\nbows: but since those instruments of war and destruction have given\r\nplace to the more powerful gun-powder, it is not so much in request. The\r\nwood is very hard and durable, and admits of a fine polish. The foliage\r\nof Yew is poisonous to cattle, who will readily eat it, if cut and\r\nthrown in their way in frosty weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n152. TILIA europaea. THE LIME or LINDEN-TREE.--Is a very ornamental tree\r\nin plantations, and from its early putting forth its leaves is much\r\nesteemed. The flowers emit a very fine scent, and the inhabitants of\r\nSwitzerland make a favourite beverage from them. The wood is very soft,\r\nthough white and beautiful. It is much used for the ornamental boxes,\r\n&c. so well known by the name of Turnbridge-ware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n153. VACCINIUM uliginosum. GREAT BILBERRY. Vaccinium Vitis Idaea, RED\r\nWHORTLE-BERRY, and Vaccinium Oxycoccos, CRANBERRY, are all edible fruits,\r\nbut do not grow in this part of the kingdom. Great quantities of\r\nCranberries are imported every winter and spring from Russia; they are\r\nmuch esteemed by the confectioners for tarts, &c. and are sold at high\r\nprices. These three kinds grow only in wet boggy places. A species which\r\nis native of America, called Vaccinium macrocarpon, has been very\r\nsuccessfully cultivated at Spring Grove by Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. and\r\nwhich has also been attempted in various other places, but not with the\r\nsame success. The fruit of this species is larger and of better flavour\r\nthan either of the other kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n154. VACCINIUM Myrtillus. WHORTS, or BILBERRIES.--To a common observer\r\nthis would appear to be a very insignificant shrub; it is not uncommonly\r\nmet with on our heaths: but it is only in particular places where it\r\nfruits in abundance, and in such districts it is of considerable value.\r\n\r\nThe waste lands on Hindhead and Blackdown in Surry and Sussex are\r\nnoticed for producing this fruit, which is similar to Black Currants.\r\nThey are gathered in the months of August and September, and sold at the\r\nneighbouring markets.\r\n\r\nIn a calculation of the value of this plant with an intelligent\r\nnurseryman in that county, we found that from 500 l. to 700 l. were\r\nearned and realized annually by the neighbouring poor, who employed\r\ntheir families in this labour, and who are in the habit of travelling\r\nmany miles for this purpose. The fruit is ripe in August, and at that\r\nseason is met with in great plenty in all the neighbouring towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n155. VISCUM album. MISSELTO.--A parasitical plant well known, and\r\nformerly of much repute in medicine, but wholly disregarded in the\r\npresent practice. Birdlime is made from the berries.\r\n\r\nDr. Pulteney in tracing the history of Botanic science quotes Pliny for\r\nan account of the veneration in which this plant was held by the Druids,\r\nwho attributed almost divine efficacy to it, and ordained the collecting\r\nit with rites and ceremonies not short of the religious strictness which\r\nwas countenanced by the superstition of the age. It was cut with a\r\ngolden knife, and when the moon was six days old gathered by the priest,\r\nwho was clothed with white for the occasion, and the plant received on a\r\nwhite napkin, and two white bulls sacrificed. Thus consecrated, Misselto\r\nwas held to be an antidote to poison, and prevented sterility. Query,\r\nHas not the custom of hanging up Misselto at merry-makings, and the\r\nceremony so well known among our belles, some relation to above\r\nsacrifice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n156. ULEX europaeus. COMMON FURZE.--The culture of this shrub is given in\r\nthe Agricultural Plants, being good for feeding cattle; its principal\r\nuse however is for fuel, and it is frequently grown for such purposes.\r\nIt is common on most of our waste lands. It also forms good fences, but\r\nshould always be kept short and young, otherwise it becomes thin,\r\nespecially in good land where it grows up and makes large bushes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n157. ULMUS campestris. THE ELM.--We have a number of varieties of the\r\nElm; the most esteemed is that with the smooth bark. The timber has been\r\nlong in request for water-pipes, and for boards, which are converted\r\ninto various uses in domestic oeconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n158. ULMUS montana. BROAD-LEAVED ELM.--This has not been considered of\r\nso great value as the common sort, but it is of much more free growth;\r\nand I have been informed that in the West of England the timber has been\r\nfound to be good and lasting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VII.--PLANTS USEFUL IN MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe initial letters in this class distinguish the Pharmacopoeia in which\r\neach plant is inserted.\r\n\r\n\"By the wise and unchangeable laws of Nature established by a Being\r\ninfinitely good and infinitely powerful,--not only man, the lord of the\r\ncreation, 'fair form who wears sweet smiles, and looks erect on heaven,'\r\nbut every subordinate being becomes subject to decay and death: pain and\r\ndisease, the inheritance of mortality, usually accelerate his\r\ndissolution. To combat these, to alleviate when it has not the power to\r\navert, Medicine, honoured art! comes to our assistance.\r\n\r\n\"It will not be expected that we should here give a history of this\r\nancient practice, or draw a parallel betwixt the success of former\r\nphysicians and those of modern times: all that concerns us to remark is,\r\nthat the ancients were infinitely more indebted to the vegetable kingdom\r\nfor the materials of their art than the moderns. Not so well acquainted\r\nwith the oeconomy of nature, which teaches us that plants were chiefly\r\ndestined for the food of various animals, they sought in every herb some\r\nlatent healing virtue, and frequently endeavoured to make up the want of\r\nefficacy in one by the combination of numbers: hence the extreme length\r\nof their farraginous prescriptions. More enlightened ideas of the\r\noperations of medicine have taught the moderns greater simplicity and\r\nconciseness in practice. Perhaps there is a danger that this simplicity\r\nmay be carried to far, and become finally detrimental to the practice.\"\r\n\r\nThe above is quoted from the Preface to a Catalogue of Medicinal Plants\r\npublished by my predecessor in 1783: and it may be observed, that the\r\nmedical student has, at the present season, a still less number of\r\nplants to store up in memory, owing, probably, to the great advances\r\nthat chemistry has made in the mean time, through which mineral articles\r\nin many instances have superseded those of the vegetable kingdom. But,\r\nnevertheless, as Dr. Woodville has justly observed, \"it would be\r\ndifficult to show that this preference is supported by any conclusive\r\nreasoning drawn from a comparative superiority of the former;\" or that\r\nthe more general use of them has led to greater success in the practice\r\nof the healing art. It is however evident, that we have much to regret\r\nthe almost total neglect of the study of medical botany by the younger\r\nbranches of the professors of physic, when we are credibly informed that\r\nCow-parsley has been administered for Hemlock, and Foxglove has been\r\nsubstituted for Coltsfoot [Footnote: See the account of a dreadful\r\naccident of this nature, in Gent. Mag. for Sept. 1815.], from which\r\ncircumstance, some valuable lives have been sacrificed. It is therefore\r\nhigh time that those persons who are engaged in the business of pharmacy\r\nshould be obliged to become so far acquainted with plants, as to be able\r\nto distinguish at sight all such as are useful in diet or medicine, and\r\nmore particularly such as are of poisonous qualities.\r\n\r\nThe medical student has so many subjects for his consideration, that it\r\nis not desirable he should have a greater number of vegetables to\r\nconsult than are necessary. And we cannot help lamenting the difficulty\r\nhe has to struggle with in consequence of the great difference of names\r\nwhich the Pharmacopoeias of the present day exhibit. The London,\r\nEdinburgh, and Dublin, in many instances, enforce the necessity of\r\nlearning a different term in each for the same thing, and none of which\r\nare called by the same they were twenty years ago. Surely it would be\r\nthe means of forwarding the knowledge of drugs, if each could be\r\ndistinguished by one general term.\r\n\r\nThe candidate for medical knowledge, however, is not the only one who\r\nhas at times to regret this confusion of names. The Linnaean system is an\r\neasy and delightful path to the knowledge of plants; but, like all other\r\nhuman structures, it has its imperfections, and some of which have been\r\nmodified by judicious alterations. Yet the teachers of this science, as\r\nwell as the students, have often to deprecate the unnecessary change in\r\nnames which has been made by many writers, though., in many cases, no\r\nmore reason appears for it than there generally would be to change\r\nChristian and surnames of persons.\r\n\r\nIn the following section, I shall enumerate and describe those plants\r\nwhich are contained in the lists of the three colleges; and afterwards a\r\nseparate list of those which, although they have been expunged, are\r\nstill sometimes used by medical men.\r\n\r\nI shall also endeavour to give such descriptions as are concise, at the\r\nsame time sufficient for general knowledge, and for which reason I have\r\ntaken Lewis's Materia Medica for my text, unless where improvements have\r\nbeen made in certain subjects I have consulted more modern authorities.\r\nIt should be observed, that writers on medical plants, with few\r\nexceptions, have copied from one another: or with a little alteration as\r\nto words only.\r\n\r\nAnd as some vegetables, from their affinitiy, may be confounded with\r\nothers, whereby those possessing medical qualities may be substituted\r\nfor others having none, or even poisonous ones, I shall in some\r\ninstances enumerate a list of similar plants, which, with attention to\r\ntheir botanical characters, it is hoped will prevent those dangerous\r\nerrors we have lately witnessed. As it is our business, in demonstrating\r\nplants, to guard the student against such confusion, it will be proper\r\nthat specimens of such as come under this head be preserved, as a work\r\nfor reference and contrast wherever doubts may arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n158. ACONITUM Napellus. COMMON BLUE MONKSHOOD. The Leaves. L. E.--Every\r\npart of the fresh plant is strongly poisonous, but the root is\r\nunquestionably the most powerful, and when chewed at first imparts a\r\nslight sensation of acrimony, and a pungent heat of the lips, gums,\r\npalate and fauces, which is succeeded by a general tremor and sensation\r\nof chilliness.\r\n\r\nThis plant has been generally prepared as an extract or inspissated\r\njuice, after the manner directed in the Edinburgh and many of the\r\nforeign Pharmacopoeias, and, like all virulent medicines, it should be\r\nfirst administered in small doses. Stoerck recommends two grains of the\r\nextract to be rubbed into a powder with two drums of sugar, and as a\r\ndose to begin with ten grains of this powder two or three times a-day.\r\n\r\nSimilar Plants.--Aconitum japonicum; A. pyrenaicum; Delphinium elatum;\r\nD. exallatum.\r\n\r\nInstead of the extract, a tincture has been made of the dried leaves\r\nmacerated in six times their weight of spirit of wine, and forty drops\r\ngiven for a dose.--Woodville's Med. Bot. 965.\r\n\r\nThe Dublin College has ordered the Aconitum Neomontanum, which is not\r\ncommon in this country [Footnote: In plants of so very poisonous a\r\nnature as the Aconite, it is the duty of every one who describes them to\r\nbe particular. Here seems to have been a confusion. The A. Neomontanum\r\nis figured in Jacquin's Fl. Austriaca, fasc. 4. p. 381; and the first\r\nedition of Hortus Kewensis under A. Napellus erroneously quotes that\r\nfigure: but both Gmelin in Syst. Vegetabilium, p. 838, and Wildenow in\r\nSpec. Plant. p. 1236, quote it under its proper name, A. Neomontanum.\r\nNow the fact is, that the Napellus is the Common Blue Monkshood; and\r\nthe Neomontanum is altogether left out of the second edition of the\r\nHortus Kewensis for the best of all reasons, it is not in this country;\r\nor, if it is, it must be very scarce, and, of course, not the plant used\r\nin medicine.].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n160. ACORCUS Calamus. SWEET RUSH. The Root. L.--It is generally looked\r\nupon as a carminative and stomachic medicine, and as such is sometimes\r\nmade use of in practice. It is said by some to be superior in aromatic\r\nflavour to any other vegetable that is produced in these northern\r\nclimates; but such as I have had an opportunity of examining, fell\r\nshort, in this respect, of several of our common plants. It is,\r\nnevertheless, a sufficiently elegant aromatic. It used to be an\r\ningredient in the Mithridate and Theriaca of the London Pharmacopoeia,\r\nand in the Edinburgh. The fresh root candied after the manner directed\r\nin our Dispensatory for candying eryngo root, is said to be employed at\r\nConstantinople as a preservative against epidemic diseases. The leaves\r\nof this plant have a sweet fragrant smell, more agreeable, though\r\nweaker, than that of the roots.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n161. AESCULUS Hippocastanum. HORSE-CHESNUT. The Bark and Seed. E. D.--\r\nWith a view to its errhine power, the Edinburgh College has introduced\r\nthe seeds into the Materia Medica, as a small portion of the powder\r\nsnuffed up the nostrils readily excites sneezing; even the infusion or\r\ndecoction of this fruit produces this effect; it has therefore been\r\nrecommended for the purpose of producing a discharge from the nose,\r\nwhich, in some complaints of the head and eyes is found to be of\r\nconsiderable benefit.\r\n\r\nOn the continent, the Bark of the Horse Chesnut-tree is held in great\r\nestimation as a febrifuge; and, upon the credit of several respectable\r\nauthors, appears to be a medicine of great efficacy.--Woodville's Med.\r\nBot. 615.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n162. AGRIMONIA Eupatoria. COMMON AGRIMONY. The Herb. D.--The leaves have\r\nan herbaceous, somewhat acrid, roughish taste, accompanied with an\r\naromatic flavour. Agrimony is said to be aperient, detergent, and to\r\nstrengthen the tone of the viscera: hence it is recommended in scorbutic\r\ndisorders, in debility and laxity of the intestines, &c. Digested in\r\nwhey, it affords an useful diet-drink for the spring season, not\r\nungrateful to the palate or stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n163. ALLIUM Porrum. LEEK. The Root. L.--This participates of the virtues\r\nof garlic, from which it differs chiefly in being much weaker. See the\r\narticle ALLIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n164. ALLIUM sativum. GARLIC. The Root. L. E. D.--This pungent root warms\r\nand stimulates the solids, and attenuates tenacious juices. Hence in\r\ncold leucophelgmatic habits it proves a powerful expectorant, diuretic,\r\nand emmenagogue; and, if the patient is kept warm, sudorific. In humoral\r\nasthmas, and catarrhous disorders of the breast, in some scurvies,\r\nflatulent colics, hysterical and other diseases proceeding from laxity\r\nof the solids, and cold sluggish indisposition of the fluids, it has\r\ngenerally good effects: it has likewise been found serviceable in some\r\nhydropic cases. Sydenham relates, that he has known the dropsy cured by\r\nthe use of garlic alone; he recommends it chiefly as a warm\r\nstrengthening medicine in the beginning of the disease.\r\n\r\nGarlic made into an unguent with oils, &c. and applied externally, is\r\nsaid to resolve and discuss cold tumors, and has been by some greatly\r\nesteemed in cutaneous diseases. It has likewise sometimes been employed\r\nas a repellent. Sydenham assures us, that among all the substances which\r\noccasion a derivation or revulsion from the head, none operate more\r\npowerfully than garlic applied to the soles of the feet: hence he was\r\nled to make use of it in the confluent small-pox about the eighth day,\r\nafter the face began to swell; the root cut in pieces, and tied in a\r\nlinen cloth, was applied to the soles, and renewed once a day till all\r\ndanger was over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n165. ALLIUM Cepa. ONION. The Root. D.--These roots are considered rather\r\nas articles of food than of medicine: they are supposed to afford little\r\nor no nourishment, and when eaten liberally they produce flatulencies,\r\noccasion thirst, headachs, and turbulent dreams: in cold phlegmatic\r\nhabits, where viscid mucus abounds, they doubtless have their use; as by\r\ntheir stimulating quality they tend to excite appetite, attenuate thick\r\njuices, and promote their expulsion: by some they are strongly\r\nrecommended in suppressions of urine and in dropsies. The chief\r\nmedicinal use of onions in the present practice is in external\r\napplications, as a cataplasm for suppurating tumours, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n166. ALTHAEA officinalis. MARSH-MALLOW. The Leaves and Root. L.--This\r\nplant has the general virtues of an emollient medicine; and proves\r\nserviceable in a thin acrimonious state of the juices, and where the\r\nnatural mucus of the intestines is abraded. It is chiefly recommended in\r\nsharp defluxions upon the lungs, hoarseness, dysenteries, and likewise\r\nin nephritic and calculous complaints; not, as some have supposed, that\r\nthis medicine has any peculiar power of dissolving or expelling the\r\ncalculus; but as, by lubricating and relaxing the vessels, it procures a\r\nmore free and easy passage. Althaea root is sometimes employed externally\r\nfor softening and maturing hard tumours: chewed, it is said to give ease\r\nin difficult dentition of children.\r\n\r\nThe officinal preparations are:-Decoctio Althaeae officinalis, and Syrupus\r\nAlthaeae.\r\n\r\nSimilar Plants.--Malva officinalis; M. rotundifolia; M. mauritanica;\r\nLavatera arborscens.\r\n\r\nThis root gives name to an officinal syrup [L. E.] and ointment [L.] and\r\nis likewise an ingredient in the compound powder of gum tragacanth [L.\r\nE.] and the oil and plaster of mucilages [L.] though it does not appear\r\nto communicate any particular virtue to the two last, its mucilaginous\r\nmatter not being dissoluble in oils.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n167. AMYGDALUS communis. SWEET and BITTER ALMONDS. L. E. D.--The oils\r\nobtained by expression from both sorts of almonds are in their sensible\r\nqualities the same. The general virtues of these oils are, to blunt\r\nacrimonious humours, and to soften and relax the solids: hence their use\r\ninternally, in tickling coughs, heat of urine, pains and inflammations:\r\nand externally in tension and rigidity of particular parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n168. ANCHUSA tinctoria. ALKANET-ROOT. E. D.--Alkanet-root has little or\r\nno smell: when recent, it has a bitterish astringent taste, but when\r\ndried scarcely any. As to its virtues, the present practice expects not\r\nany from it. Its chief use is for colouring oils, unguents, and\r\nplasters. As the colour is confined to the cortical part, the small\r\nroots are best, these having proportionally more bark than the large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n169. ANETHUM graveolens. DILL. The Seeds. L.--Their taste is moderately\r\nwarm and pungent; their smell aromatic, but not of the most agreeable\r\nkind. These seeds are recommended as a carminative, in flatulent colics\r\nproceeding from a cold cause or a viscidity of the juices. The most\r\nefficacious preparations of them are, the distilled oil, and a tincture\r\nor extract made with rectified spirit. The oil and simple water\r\ndistilled from them are kept in the shops.--Lewis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n170. ANETHUM Foeniculum. FENNEL. Seeds. E.--These are supposed to be\r\nstomachic and carminative; but this, and indeed all the other effects\r\nascribed to them, as depending upon their stimulant and aromatic\r\nqualities, must be less considerable than those of Dill, Aniseed, or\r\nCaraway, though termed one of the four greater hot seeds.--Woodville's\r\nMed. Bot. p. 129.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n171. ANGELICA Archangelica. GARDEN ANGELICA. The Root, Leaves, and\r\nSeeds. E.--All the parts of Angelica, especially the roots, have a\r\nfragrant aromatic smell, and a pleasant bitterish warm taste, glowing\r\nupon the lips and palate for a long time after they have been chewed.\r\nThe flavour of the seeds and leaves is very perishable, particularly\r\nthat of the latter, which, on being barely dried, lose greatest part of\r\ntheir taste and smell: the roots are more tenacious of their flavour,\r\nthough even these lose part of it upon keeping. The fresh root, wounded\r\nearly in the spring, yields and odorous yellow juice, which slowly\r\nexsiccated proves an elegant gummy resin, very rich in the virtues of\r\nthe Angelica. On drying the root, this juice concretes into distinct\r\nmoleculae, which, on cutting it longitudinally, appear distributed in\r\nlittle veins: in this state they are extracted by pure spirit, but not\r\nby watery liquors.\r\n\r\nThis resin is considered one of the most elegant aromatics of European\r\ngrowth, though little regarded in the present practice, and is rarely\r\nmet with in prescription; neither does it enter any officinal\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n172. ANTHEMIS nobilis. CHAMOMILE. The Flowers. L.E.D.--These have a\r\nstrong not ungrateful, aromatic smell, but a very bitter nauseous taste.\r\nThey are accounted carminative, aperient, emollient, and in some measure\r\nanodyne: and stand recommended in flatulent colics, for promoting the\r\nuterine purgations, in spasmodic affections, and the pains of women in\r\nchild-bed: sometimes they have been employed in intermittent fevers, and\r\nthe nephritis. These flowers are also frequently used externally in\r\ndiscutient and antiseptic fomentations, and in emollient glysters. The\r\ndouble-flowered variety is usually cultivated for medicine, but the wild\r\nkind with single flowers is preferable.\r\n\r\nSimilar Plants.--Anthemis arvensis; A. Cotula; Pyrethrum maritimum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n173. ANTHEMIS Pyrethrum. PELLITORY OF SPAIN. The Root. L.--The principal\r\nuse of Pyrethrum in the present practice is as a masticatory, for\r\npromoting the salival flux, and evacuating viscid humours from the head\r\nand neighbouring parts: by this means it very generally relieves the\r\ntooth-ach, pains of the head, and lethargic complaints. If a piece of\r\nthe root, the size of a pea, be placed against the tooth, it instantly\r\ncauses the saliva to flow from the surrounding glands, and gives\r\nimmediate relief in all cases of that malady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n174. APIUM Petroselium. COMMON PARSLEY. The Root. E.--Both the roots and\r\nseeds of Parsley are directed by the London College for medicinal use:\r\nthe former have a sweetish taste, accompanied with a slight warmth of\r\nflavour somewhat resembling that of a carrot; the latter are in taste\r\nwarmer and more aromatic than any other part of the plant, and also\r\nmanifest considerable bittenress.\r\n\r\nThese roots are said to be aperient and diuretic, and have been\r\nemployed in apozems to relieve nephritic pains, and obstructions of\r\nurine.\r\n\r\nAlthough Parsley is commonly used at table, it is remarkable that facts\r\nhave been adducted to prove, that in some constitutions it occasions\r\nepilepsy, or at least aggravates the epileptic fit in those who are\r\nsubject to this disease. It has been supposed also to produce\r\ninflammation in the eyes.--Woodville's Med. Bot. p. 43. A variety which\r\nproduces larger roots, called Hamburgh Parsley, is commonly grown for\r\nmedicinal uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n175. ARBUTUS Uva Ursi. TRAILING ARBUTUS or BEAR-BERRY. The Leaves.--This\r\nfirst drew the attention of physicians as an useful remedy in calculous\r\nand nephritic affections; and in the years 1763 and 1764, by the\r\nconcurrent testimonies of different authors, it acquired remarkable\r\ncelebrity, not only for its efficacy in gravelly complaints, but in\r\nalmost every other to which the urinary organs are liable, as ulcers of\r\nthe kidneys and bladder, cystirrhoea, diabetes, &c. It may be employed\r\neither in powder or decoction; the former is most commonly preferred,\r\nand given in doses from a scruple to a dram two or three times a-day.--\r\nWoodville's Med. Botany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n176. ARNICA montana. MOUNTAIN ARNICA. The whole Plant. E. D.--The odour\r\nof the fresh plant is rather unpleasant, and the taste acrid,\r\nherbaceous, and astringent; and the powdered leaves act as a strong\r\nsternutatory.\r\n\r\nThis plant, according to Bergius, is an emetic, errhine, diuretic,\r\ndiaphoretic, emmenagogue; and from its supposed power of attenuating the\r\nblood, it has been esteemed so peculiarly efficacious in obviating the\r\nbad consequences occasioned by falls and bruises, that it obtained the\r\nappellation of Panacea Lapsorum.--Woodville's Med. Bot. p. 43.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n177. ARTEMISIA Absinthium. WORMWOOD, The Herb. L.--Wormwood is a strong\r\nbitter; and was formerly much used as such against weakness of the\r\nstomach, and the like, in medicated wines and ales. At present it is\r\nrarely employed in these intentions, on account of the ill relish and\r\noffensive smell which it is accompanied with. These it may be in part\r\nfreed from by keeping, and totally by long coction, the bitter remaining\r\nentire. An extract made by boiling the leaves in a large quantity of\r\nwater, and evaporating the liquor with a strong fire, proves a bitter\r\nsufficiently grateful, without any disgustful flavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n178. ARTEMISIA Abrotanum. SOUTHERNWOOD. Leaves. D.--Southernwood has a\r\nstrong, not very disagreeable smell; and a nauseous, pungent, bitter\r\ntaste; which is totally extracted by rectified spirit, less perfectly by\r\nwatery liquors. It is recommended as an anthelmintic; and in cold\r\nlencophlegmatic habits, as a stimulant, detergent, aperient, and\r\nsudorific. The present practice has almost entirely confined its use to\r\nexternal applications. The leaves are frequently employed in discutient\r\nand antiseptic fomentations; and have been recommended also in lotions\r\nand unguents for cutaneous eruptions, and the falling off of the hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n179. ARTEMISIA maritima. SEA WORMWOOD. Tops. D.--In taste and smell, it\r\nis weaker and less unpleasant than the common worm-wood. The virutes of\r\nboth are supposed to be of the same kind, and to differ only in\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nThe tops used to enter three of our distilled waters, and give name to a\r\nconserve. They are an ingredient also in the common fomentation and\r\ngreen oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n180. ARTEMISIA Santonica. ROMAN WORMWOOD. Seeds. E. D.--It is a native\r\nof the warmer countries, and at present difficultly procurable in this,\r\nthough as hardy and as easily raised as any of the other sorts. Sea\r\nwormwood has long supplied its place in the markets, and been in general\r\nmistaken for it.\r\n\r\nRoman wormwood is less ungrateful than either of the others: its smell\r\nis tolerably pleasant: the taste, though manifestly bitter, scarcely\r\ndisagreeable. It appears to be the most eligible of the three as a\r\nstomachic; and is likewise recommended by some in dropsies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n181. ARUM maculatum. BITING ARUM. Fresh Root. L. E.--This root is a\r\npowerful stimulant and attenuant. It is reckoned a medicine of great\r\nefficacy in some cachectic and chlorotic cases; in weakness of the\r\nstomach occasioned by a load of viscid phlegm, and in such disorders in\r\ngeneral as proceed from a cold sluggish indisposition of the solids and\r\nlentor of the fluids. I have experienced great benefit from it in\r\nrheumatic pains, particularly those of the fixed kind, and which were\r\nseated deep. In these cases I have given from ten grains to a scruple of\r\nthe fresh root twice or thrice a day, made into a bolus or emulsion with\r\nunctuous and mucilaginous substances, which cover its pungency, and\r\nprevent its making any painful impression on the tongue. It generally\r\nexcited a slight tingling sensation through the whole habit, and, when\r\nthe patient was kept warm in bed, produced a copious sweat.\r\n\r\nThe only officinal preparation, in which this root was an ingredient,\r\nwas a compound powder; in which form its virtues are very precarious.\r\nSome recommend a tincture of it drawn with wine; but neither wine,\r\nwater, nor spirit, extract its virtues.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n182. ASARUM Europaeum, ASARABACCA. The Leaves. L. E. D.--Both the roots\r\nand leaves have a nauseous, bitter, acrimonious, hot taste; their smell\r\nis strong, and not very disagreeable. Given in substance from half a\r\ndram to a dram, they evacuate powerfully both upwards and downwards. It\r\nis said that tinctures made in spirituous menstrua possess both the\r\nemetic and cathartic virtues of the plant: that the extract obtained by\r\ninspissating these tinctures acts only by vomit, and with great\r\nmildness: that an infusion in water proves cathartic, rarely emetic:\r\nthat aqueous decoctions made by long boiling, and the watery extract,\r\nhave no purgative or emetic quality, but prove notable diaphoretics,\r\ndiuretics, and emmenagogues.\r\n\r\nIts principal use at present is as a sternutatory. The root of asarum is\r\nperhaps the strongest of all the vegetable errhines, white hellebore\r\nitself not excepted. Snuffed up the nose, in the quantity of a grain or\r\ntwo, it occasions a large evacuation of mucus, and raises a plentiful\r\nspitting. The leaves are considerably milder, and may be used to the\r\nquantity of three, four, or five grains. Geoffroy relates, that after\r\nsnuffing up a dose of this errhine at night, he has frequently observed\r\nthe discharge from the nose to continue for three days together; and\r\nthat he has known a paralysis of the mouth and tongue cured by one dose.\r\nHe recommends this medicine in stubborn disorders of the head,\r\nproceeding from viscid tenacious matter, in palsies, and in soporific\r\ndistempers. The leaves are an ingredient in the pulvis sternutatoris of\r\nthe shops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n183. ASPIDIUM Filix-Mas. Polypodium, Linn. MALE FERN. The Roots. L. E.\r\nD.--They are said to be aperient and anthelmintic. Simon Pauli tells us,\r\nthat they have been the grand secret of some empirics against the broad\r\nkind of worms called taenia; and that the dose is one, two, or three\r\ndrams of the powder. Two other kinds of Ferns used to be recommended;\r\nbut this, being the strongest, has therefore been made choice of in\r\npreference, though the College of Edinburgh still retain them in their\r\nCatalogue of Simples.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n184. ASTRAGALUS Tragacanthus. GOATS-THORN. The Gum. L. E. D.--This gum\r\nis of a strong body, and does not perfectly dissolve in water. A dram\r\nwill give to a pint of water the consistence of a syrup, which a whole\r\nounce of gum Arabic is scarce sufficient to do. Hence its use for\r\nforming troches, and the like purposes, in preference to the other gums.\r\nIt is used in an officinal powder, and is an ingredient in the compound\r\npowders of ceruss and amber.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n185. ATROPA Belladonna. DEADLY NIGHTSHADE. The Leaves, L. E. D.--\r\nBelladonna was first employed as an external application, in the form of\r\nfomentation, to scirrhus and cancer. It was afterwards administered\r\ninternally in the same affections; and numerous cases, in which it had\r\nproved successful, were given on the authority of the German\r\npractitioners. It has been recommended, too, as a remedy in extensive\r\nulceration, in paralysis, chronic rheumatism, epilepsy, mania, and\r\nhydrophobia, but with so little discrimination, that little reliance can\r\nbe placed on the testimonies in its favour; and, in modern practice, it\r\nis little employed. It appears to have a peculiar action on the eye:\r\nhence it has been used in amaurosis; and from its power of causing\r\ndilatation of the pupil, when topically applied under the form of\r\ninfusion, it has been used before performing the operation for cataract.\r\nA practice which is hazardous, as the pupil, though much dilated by the\r\napplication, instantly contracts when the instrument is introduced. When\r\ngiven internally, its dose is from one to three grains of the dried\r\nleaves, or one grain of the inspissated juice.--Murray's Mat. Med. p.\r\n174.\r\n\r\nI have had a cancer of the lip entirely cured by it: a scirrhosity in a\r\nwoman's breast, of such kind as frequently proceeds to cancer, I have\r\nfound entirely discussed by the use of it. A sore, a little below the\r\neye, which had put on a cancerous appearance, was much mended by the\r\ninternal use of the Belladonna; but the patient having learned somewhat\r\nof the poisonous nature of the medicine, refused to continue the use of\r\nit; upon which the sore grain spread, and was painful; but, upon a\r\nreturn to the use of the Belladonna, was again mended to a considerable\r\ndegree; when the same fears again returning, the use of it was again\r\nlaid aside, and with the same consequence, the sore becoming worse. Of\r\nthese alternate states, connected with the alternate use of and\r\nabstinence from the Belladonna, there were several of these alterations\r\nwhich fell under my own observation [Footnote: See the Poisonous Plants,\r\nin a future page].--Cullen's Mat. Med. vol. ii. p. 270.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n186. CARDAMINE pratensis. LADIES SMOCK. The Leaves. L. E. D.--Long ago\r\nit was employed as a diuretic; and, of late, it has been introduced in\r\nnervous diseases, as epilepsy, hysteria, choraea, asthma, &c. A dram or\r\ntwo of the powder is given twice or thrice a-day. It has little sensible\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n187. CARUM Carui. CARAWAY. The Seeds. L. E. D.--These are in the number\r\nof the four greater hot seeds; and frequently employed as a stomachic\r\nand carminative in flatulent colics, and the like. Their officinal\r\npreparations are an essential oil and a spiritous water; they were used\r\nas ingredients also in the compound juniper water, tincture of sena,\r\nstomachic tincture, oxymel of garlic, electuary of bayberries and of\r\nscammony, and the cummin-seed plaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n188. CENTAUREA benedicta. BLESSED THISTLE. The Leaves. E. D.--The herb\r\nshould be gathered when in flower, great care taken in drying it, and\r\nkept in a very dry airy place, to prevent its rotting or growing mouldy,\r\nwhich it is very apt to do. The leaves have a penetrating bitter taste,\r\nnot very strong or very durable, accompanied with an ungrateful flavour,\r\nwhich they are in great measure freed from by keeping.\r\n\r\nThe virtues of this plant seem to be little known in the present\r\npractice. We have frequently experienced excellent effects from a light\r\ninfusion of carduus in loss of appetite, where the stomach was injured\r\nby irregularities. A stronger infusion made in cold or warm water, if\r\ndrunk freely, and the patient kept warm, occasions a plentiful sweat,\r\nand promotes all the secretions in general.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of this plant are also considerably bitter, and have been\r\nsometimes used for the same purposes as the leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n189. CHIRONIA Centaurium. LESSER CENTAURY. The Tops. L. E. D.--This is\r\njustly esteemed to be the most efficacious bitter of all the medicinal\r\nplants indigenous to this country. It has been recommended as a\r\nsubstitute for Gentian, and, by several, thought to be a more useful\r\nmedicine: experiments have also shown it to possess an equal degree of\r\nantiseptic power.\r\n\r\nMany authors have observed, that, along with the tonic and stomachic\r\nqualities of a bitter, Centaury frequently proves cathartic; but it is\r\npossible that this seldom happens, unless it be taken in very large\r\ndoses. The use of this, as well as of the other bitters, was formerly\r\ncommon in febrile disorders previous to the knowledge of Peruvian-bark,\r\nwhich now supersedes them perhaps too generally; for many cases of fever\r\noccur which are found to be aggravated by the Cinchona, yet afterwards\r\nreadily yield to the simple bitters.--Woodville, p. 277.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n190. COCHLEARIA officinalis. SCURVY-GRASS. The Herb. E.--Is antiseptic,\r\nattenuant, aperient, and diuretic, and is said to open obstructions of\r\nthe viscera and remoter glands, without heating or irritating the\r\nsystem. It has long been considered as the most effectual of all the\r\nantiscorbutic plants; and its sensible qualities are sufficiently\r\npowerful to confirm this opinion. In the rheumatismus vagus, called by\r\nSydenham Rheumatismus scorbuticus, consisting of wandering pains of long\r\ncontinuance, accompanied with fever, this plant, combined with Arum and\r\nWood-Sorrel, is highly commended both by Sydenham and Lewis.\r\n\r\nWe have testimony of its great use in scurvy, not only from physicians,\r\nbut navigators; as Anson, Linschoten, Maartens, Egede, and others. And\r\nit has been justly noticed, that this plant grows plentifully in those\r\nhigh latitudes where the scurvy is most obnoxious. Forster found it in\r\ngreat abundance in the islands of the South Seas.--Woodville, p. 395.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n191. COCHLEARIA Armoracia. HORSE-RADISH. The Root. E.-The medical\r\neffects of this root are, to stimulate the solids, attenuate the juices,\r\nand promote the fluid secretions: it seems to extend its action through\r\nthe whole habit, and affect the minutest glands. It has frequently done\r\ngreat service in some kinds of scurvies and other chronic disorders\r\nproceeding from a viscidity of the juices, or obstructions of the\r\nexcretory ducts. Sydenham recommends it likewise in dropsies,\r\nparticularly those which sometimes follow intermittent fevers. Both\r\nwater and rectified spirit extract the virtues of this root by infusion,\r\nand elevate them in distillation: along with the aqueous fluid an\r\nessential oil arises, possessing the whole taste and pungency of the\r\nhorse-radish. The College have given us a very elegant compound water,\r\nwhich takes its name from this root.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n192. COLCHICUM autumnale. MEADOW-SAFFRON. The Roots. L. E. D.--The\r\nroots, freed from the outer blackish coat and fibres below, are white,\r\nand full of a white juice. In drying they become wrinkled and dark\r\ncoloured. Applied to the skin, it shows some signs of acrimony; and\r\ntaken internally, it is said sometimes to excite a sense of burning\r\nheat, bloody stools, and other violent symptoms. In the form of syrup,\r\nhowever, it has been given to the extent of two ounces a-day without any\r\nbad consequence. It is sometimes employed as a diuretic in dropsy. It is\r\nnow supposed to be a principal ingredient in the celebrated French gout\r\nmedicine L'Eau Medicinale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n193. CONIUM maculatum. HEMLOCK. The Leaves. L. E. D.--Physicians seem\r\nsomewhat in dispute about the best mode of exhibiting this medicine;\r\nsome recommending the extract, as being most easily taken in the form of\r\npills; others the powder, as not being subject to that variation which\r\nthe extract is liable to, from being made in different ways. With\r\nrespect to the period, likewise, at which the plant should be gathered,\r\nthey seem not perfectly agreed; some recommending it when in its full\r\nvigour, and just coming into bloom, and others, when the flowers are\r\ngoing off. An extract of the green plant is ordered by the College in\r\ntheir last list. Dr. Cullen has for many years commended the making it\r\nfrom the unripe seeds; and this mode the College of Physicians at\r\nEdinburgh have thought proper to adopt in their late Pharmacopoeia.\r\n\r\nSimilar Plants.--Aethusa Cynapium; Apium Petroselium; Oenanthe crocata;\r\nOe. fistulosa; Phellandrium aquaticum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n194. CORIANDRUM sativum. CORIANDER. The Seeds. L. E. D.-These, when\r\nfresh, have a strong disagreeable smell, which improves by drying, and\r\nbecomes sufficiently grateful. They are recommmended as carminative and\r\nstomachic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n195. CROCUS sativus. TRUE SAFFRON. The Stigmata. L. E. D.--There are\r\nthree sorts of saffron met with in the shops, two of which are brought\r\nfrom abroad, the other is the produce of our own country. This last is\r\ngreatly superior to the two former.\r\n\r\nThis medicine is particularly serviceable in hysteric depressions\r\nproceeding from a cold cause, or obstruction of the uterine secretions,\r\nwhere other aromatics, even those of the more generous kind, have little\r\neffect. Saffron imparts the whole of its virtue and colour to rectified\r\nspirit, proof spirit, wine, vinegar, and water: a tincture used to be\r\ndrawn with vinegar, but it looses greatly its colour in keeping. There\r\ncan be little use for preparations of saffron, as the drug itself will\r\nkeep good for any length of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n196. CUMINUM Cymini. CUMMIN. The Seeds. L.--Cummin seeds have a\r\nbitterish warm taste, accompanied with an aromatic flavour, not of the\r\nmost agreeable kind. They are accounted good carminatives, but not very\r\noften made use of. An essential oil of them used to be kept in the\r\nshops, and they gave name to a plaster and cataplasm.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n197. CYNARA Scolymus. ARTICHOKE. The Leaves. E.--The bitter juice of the\r\nleaf, mixed with an equal part of Madeira wine, is recommended in an\r\nounce dose night and morning, as a powerful diuretic in dropsy. An\r\ninfusion of the leaf may likewise be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n198. DAPHNE Mezereum. THE MEZEREON. The Roots. L. E. D.--This plant is\r\nextremely acrid, especially when fresh, and, if retained in the mouth,\r\nexcites great and long continued heat and inflammation, particularly of\r\nthe throat and fauces. The bark and berries of Mezereon in different\r\nforms have been long externally used to obstinate ulcers and ill\r\nconditioned sores. In France, the former is strongly recommended as an\r\napplication to the skin, which, under certain management, produces a\r\ncontinued serious discharge without blistering, and is thus rendered\r\nuseful in many chronic diseases of a local nature answering the purpose\r\nof what has been called a perpetual blister, while it occasions less\r\npain and inconvenience.\r\n\r\nIn this country Mezereon is principally employed for the cure of some\r\nsiphylitic complaints; and in this way Dr. Donald Monro was the first\r\nwho gave testimony of its efficacy in the successful use of the Lisbon\r\nDiet Drink.\r\n\r\nThe considerable and long-continued heat and irritation that is produced\r\nin the throat when Mezereon is chewed, induced Dr. Withering to think of\r\ngiving it in a case of difficulty of swallowing, seemingly occasioned by\r\na paralytic affection. The patient was directed to chew a thin slice of\r\nthe root as often as she could bear it, and in about a month recovered\r\nher power of swallowing. This woman had suffered the complaint three\r\nyears, and was greatly reduced, being totally unable to swallow solids,\r\nand liquids but very imperfectly.--Woodville's Med. Bot. p. 720.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n199. DATURA Stramonium. THORN APPLE. The whole Plant. E.--Dr. Woodville\r\ninforms us, that an extract of this plant has been the preparation\r\nusually employed, and from one to ten grains and upwards a-day: but the\r\npowdered leaves after the manner of those directed for hemlock would\r\nseem, for the reason given, to be a preparation more certain and\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\nIt has been much celebrated as a medicine in epilepsy and convulsions\r\nand mania; but it is of a violent narcotic quality, and extremely\r\ndangerous in its effects.\r\n\r\nStramonium has been recommended, as being of considerable use in cases\r\nof asthma, on the authority of some eminent physicians of the East\r\nIndies; and the late Dr. Roxburgh has stated to me many instances\r\nwherein it had performed wonders in that dreadful malady.\r\n\r\nThe Datura Metal, Purple-flowered Thorn-apple, is much like the\r\nStramonium, except in the flowers and the stalks being of a purple\r\ncolour. I have made particular inquiry of Dr. Roxburgh if any particular\r\nkind was used in preference, and he said not; that both the above sorts\r\nwere used; and, in fact, not only these, but the Datura Tatula, another\r\nspecies which grows wild there, and is cultivated in our stoves for the\r\nsake of its beautiful flowers, is also used for the same purposes.\r\n\r\nThe mode of using it was by cutting the whole plant up after drying, and\r\nsmoking it in a common tobacco-pipe; and which, in some cases in this\r\ncountry also, has given great ease in severe attacks; and I know several\r\npersons who use it with good effect to this day. In vegetables of such\r\npowerful effects as this is known to have, great care ought to be taken\r\nin their preparation, which, I fear, is not always so much attended to\r\nas the nature of this subject requires [Footnote: See Observations on and\r\nDirections for preparing and preserving Herbs in general, et the end of\r\nthis section.].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n200. DAUCUS sylvestris. WILD CARROT. The Seeds. L.--These seeds possess,\r\nthough not in a very considerable degree, the aromatic qualities common\r\nto those of the umbelliferous plants, and hence have long been deemed\r\ncarminative and emmenagogue; but they are chiefly esteemed for their\r\ndiuretic powers, and for their utility in calculus and nephritic\r\ncomplaints, in which an infusion of three spoonfuls of the seeds in a\r\npint of boiling water has been recommended; or the seeds may be\r\nfermented in malt liquor, which receives from them an agreeable flavour\r\nresembling that of the lemon-peel.--Woodville's Med. Bot. p. 132.\r\n\r\nSimilar Plants.--Sison Amonum; Daucus Carota.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n201. DAUCUS Carota. CULTIVATED CARROT. The Roots. L. E. D.--The\r\nexpressed juice, or a decoction of these roots, has been recommended in\r\ncalculous complaints, and as a gargle for infants in aphtous affections\r\nor excoriations of the mouth; and a poultice of scraped carrots has been\r\nfound an useful application to phagedenic ulcers, and to cancerous and\r\nputrid sores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n202. DELPHINIUM Staphis Agria. STAVES AGRIA. The Seeds. L. D.--\r\nStavesacre was employed by the ancients as a cathartic, but it operates\r\nwith so much violence both upwards and downwards, that its internal use\r\nhas been, among the generality of practitioners, for some time laid\r\naside. It is chiefly employed in external applications for some kinds of\r\ncutaneous eruptions; and for destroying lice and other insects; insomuch\r\nthat it has from this virtue received its name in different languages,\r\nHerba pedicularis, Herbe aux poux, Lauskraut, Lousewort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n203. DIANTHUS caryophyllus. CLOVE-PINK. The Petals. E.--These flowers\r\nare said to be cardiac and alexipharmac. Simon Paulli relates, that he\r\nhas cured many malignant fevers by the use of a de-coction of them;\r\nwhich he says powerfully promoted sweat and urine without greatly\r\nirritating nature, and also raised the spirits and quenched thirst. The\r\nflowers are chiefly valued for their pleasant flavour, which is entirely\r\nlost even by light coction. Lewis says, the College directed the syrup,\r\nwhich is the only officinal preparation of them, to be made by infusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n204. DIGITALIS purpurea. FOXGLOVE. The Leaves. L. E. D.--The leaves of\r\nFoxglove have a nauseous taste, but no remarkable smell. They have been\r\nlong used externally to sores and scrophulous tumours with considerable\r\nadvantage. Its diuretic effects, for which it is now so deservedly\r\nreceived into the Materia Medica, were entirely overlooked. To this\r\ndiscovery Dr. Withering has an undoubted claim; and the numerous cures\r\nof dropsy related by him and other practitioners of established\r\nreputation, afford incontestable proofs of its diuretic powers, and of\r\nits practical importance in the cure of those diseases. The dose of\r\ndried leaves in powder is from one grain to three twice a-day; but if a\r\nliquid medicine be preferred, a dram of the dried leaves is to be\r\ninfused for four hours in half a pint of boiling water, adding to the\r\nstrained liquor an ounce of any spiritous water. One ounce of this\r\ninfusion given twice a-day is a medium dose; it is to be continued in\r\nthese doses till it either acts upon the kidneys; the stomach, or the\r\npulse, (which it has a remarkable power of lowering,) or the bowels.--\r\nWoodville's Med. Bot. p. 221.\r\n\r\nThis is now become a very popular medicine, but if used incautiously is\r\nattended with danger. Medical practitioners should make themselves\r\nperfectly acquainted with this plant, as the leaves are the only part\r\nused; and their not being readilly discriminated when separated from the\r\nflowers, several accidents have occurred. In the Gent. Mag. for\r\nSeptember 1815 is recorded a very extraordinary mistake, where the life\r\nof a child was sacrificed to the ignorance of a person who administered\r\nthis instead of Coltsfoot; a plant so very dissimilar, that, had it not\r\nbeen well authenticated, I should not have believed the fact.\r\n\r\nSimilar Plants.--Verbascum nigrum; V. Thapsus; Cynoglossum officinale,\r\nor, after the above mistake, any other plant with a lanceolate leaf, we\r\nfear, may be confounded with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n205. ERYNGIUM maritimum. SEA-HOLLY. Roots. D.--The roots are slender,\r\nand very long; of a pleasant sweetish taste, which on chewing for some\r\ntime is followed by a light degree of aromatic warmth and acrimony. They\r\nare accounted aperient and diuretic, and have also been celebrated as\r\naphrodisiac: their virtues, however, are too weak to admit them under\r\nthe head of medicines. The candied root is ordered to be kept in the\r\nshops.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n206. FERULA assafoetida. ASSAFOETIDA. Gum. L. E. D.--This drug has a\r\nstrong fetid smell, somewhat like that of garlick; and a bitter, acrid,\r\nbiting taste. It looses with age of its smell and strength, a\r\ncircumstance to be particularly regarded in its exhibition. It consists\r\nof about one-third part pure resin, and two-thirds of gummy matter; the\r\nformer soluble in rectified spirit, the other in water. Proof-spirit\r\ndissolves almost the whole into a turbid liquor; the tincture in\r\nrectified spirit is transparent.\r\n\r\nAssafoetida is the strongest of the fetid gums, and of frequent use in\r\nhysteric and different kinds of nervous complaints. It is likewise of\r\nconsiderable efficacy in flatulent colics; and for promoting all the\r\nfluid secretions in either sex. The ancients attributed to this medicine\r\nmany other virtues which are at present not expected from it.--Lewis's\r\nMat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n207. FICUS Carica. COMMON FIG. Fruit. L. D.--The recent fruit completely\r\nripe is soft, succulent, and easily digested, unless eaten in immoderate\r\nquantities, when it is apt to occasion flatulency, pain of the bowels,\r\nand diarrhoea. The dried fruit is pleasanter to the taste, and is more\r\nwholesome and nutritive. Figs are supposed to be more nutritious by\r\nhaving their sugar united with a large portion of mucilaginous matter,\r\nwhich, from being thought to be of an oily nature, has been long\r\nesteemed an useful demulcent and pectoral; and it is chiefly with a view\r\nof these effects that they have been medicinally employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n208. FRAXINUS Ornus. MANNA. L. E. D.--There are several sorts of Manna\r\nin the shops. The larger pieces, called Flake Manna, are usually\r\npreferred; though the smaller grains are equally as good, provided they\r\nare white, or of a pale yellow colour, very light, of a sweet not\r\nunpleasant taste, and free from any visible impurities.\r\n\r\nManna is a mild agreeable laxative, and may be given with saftey to\r\nchildren and pregnant women: nevertheless, in some particular\r\nconstitutions it acts very unkindly, producing flatulencies and\r\ndistension of the viscera.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n209. GENTIANA lutea. YELLOW GENTIAN. Root. L. D.--This root is a strong\r\nbitter, and, as such, very frequently made use of in practice: in taste\r\nit is less exceptionable than most of the other substances of this\r\nclass: infusions of it, flavoured with orange peel, are sufficiently\r\ngrateful. It is the capital ingredient in the bitter wine; and a\r\ntincture and infusion of it are kept in the shops.\r\n\r\nLewis mentions a poisonous root being mixed among some of the Gentian\r\nbrought to London; the use of which occasioned in some instances death.\r\nThis was internally of a white colour, and void of bitterness. There is\r\nno doubt but this was the root of the Veratrum album, a poisonous plant\r\nso similar, that it might readily be mistaken for it.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n210. GEUM urbanum. COMMON AVENS. Root. D.--This has a warm, bitterish,\r\nastringent taste, and a pleasant smell, somewhat of the clove kind,\r\nespecially in the spring, and when produced in dry warm soils. Parkinson\r\nobserves, that such as is the growth of moist soils has nothing of this\r\nflavour. This root has been employed as a stomachic, and for\r\nstrengthening the tone of the viscera in general: it is still in some\r\nesteem in foreign countries, though not taken notice of among us. It\r\nyields, on distillation, an elegant odoriferous essential oil, which\r\nconcretes into a flaky form.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\nSimilar Plants.--Geum rivale; G. intermedium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n211. GLYCYRRHIZA glabra. LIQUORICE. Root. L. D.--This is produced\r\nplentifully in all the countries of Europe: that which is the growth of\r\nour own is preferable to such as comes from abroad; this last being\r\ngenerally mouldy, which this root is very apt to become, unless kept in\r\na dry place.\r\n\r\nThe powder of liquorice usually sold is often mingled with flower, and,\r\nI fear, too often with substances not quite so wholesome. The best sort\r\nis of a brownish yellow colour (the fine pale yellow being generally\r\nsophisticated) and of a very rich sweet taste, much more agreeable than\r\nthat of the fresh root. Liquorice is almost the only sweet that quenches\r\nthirst.\r\n\r\nThis root is a very useful pectoral, and excellently softens acrimonious\r\nhumours, at the same time that it proves gently detergent: and this\r\naccount is warranted by experience. It is an ingredient in the pectoral\r\nsyrup, pectoral troches, the compound lime waters, decoction of the\r\nwoods, compound powder of gum tragacanth, lenitive electuary, and\r\ntheriaca. An extract is directed to be made from it in the shops; but\r\nthis preparation is brought chiefly from abroad, though the foreign\r\nextract is not equal to such as is made with proper care among\r\nourselves.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n212. GRATIOLA officinalis. HEDGE-HYSSOP. Herb. E. D.--The leaves have a\r\nvery bitter disagreeable taste: an infusion of a handful of them when\r\nfresh, or a dram when dried, is said to operate strongly as a cathartic.\r\nKramer reports that he has found the root of this plant a medicine\r\nsimilar in virtue to Ipecacuanha.\r\n\r\nSimilar Plants.--Lythrum Salicaria; Scutellaria galericulata.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n213. HELLEBORUS niger. BLACK HELLEBORE. Root. L.--The tase of Hellebore\r\nis acrid and bitter. Its acrimony, as Dr. Grew observes, is first felt\r\non the tip of the tongue, and then spreads immediately to the middle,\r\nwithout being much perceived on the intermediate part: on chewing it for\r\na few minutes, the tongue seems benumbed, and affected with a kind of\r\nparalytic stupor, as when burnt by eating any thing too hot.\r\n\r\nOur Hellebore is at present looked upon principally as an alterative,\r\nand in this light is frequently employed, in small doses, for\r\nattenuating viscid humours, promoting the uterine and urinary\r\ndischarges, and opening inveterate obstructions of the remoter glands:\r\nit often proves a very powerful emmenagogue in plethoric habits, where\r\nsteel is ineffectual or improper. An extract made from this root with\r\nwater, is one of the mildest, and for the purposes of a cathartic the\r\nmost effectual preparation of it: this operates sufficiently, without\r\noccasioning the irritation which the pure resin is accompanied with. A\r\ntincture drawn with proof-spirit contains the whole virtue of the\r\nHellebore, and seems to be one of the best preparations of it: this\r\ntincture, and the extract, used to be kept in the shops. The College of\r\nEdinburgh used to make this root an ingredient in the purging cephalic\r\ntincture, and compound tincture of jalap; and its extract, in the\r\npurging deobstruent pills, gamboge pills, the laxative mercurial pills,\r\nand the compound cathartic extract.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\nSimilar Plant.--Helleborus viridis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n214. HELLEBORUS foetidus. BEARSFOOT. Leaves. L.--The root is a strong\r\ncathartic; it destroys worms, and is recommended in different species of\r\nmania. It is commonly substituted for that of the Helleborus viridis,\r\nwhich is a more dangerous medicine. Hill's Herbal, p. 32. Great care\r\nought to be used in the administering this plant: many instances of its\r\ndreadful effects are related. (See Poisonous Plants.)\r\n\r\nSimilar Plant.--Helleborus viridis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n215. HORDEUM distichon. PEARL BARLEY. Seeds. L. E.--Barley, in its\r\nseveral states, is more cooling, less glutionous, and less nutritious\r\nthan wheat or oats; among the ancients, decoctions of it were the\r\nprincipal aliment, and medicine, in acute diseases. The London College\r\ndirect a decoction of pearl barley; and both the London and Edinburgh\r\nmake common barley an ingredient in the pectoral decoction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n216. HUMULUS Lupulus. THE HOP.--The flowers and seed-vessels are used in\r\ngout and rheumatism, under the form of infusion in boiling-water. The\r\npowder formed into an ointment with lard, is said to ease the pain of\r\nopen cancer. A pillow stuffed with hops is an old and successful mode of\r\nprocuring sleep in the watchfulness of delirious fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n217. HYOSCYAMUS niger. HENBANE. Leaves and Seeds. L. E.--Henbane is a\r\nstrong narcotic poison, and many instances of its deleterious effects\r\nare recorded by different authors; from which it appears, that any part\r\nof the plant, when taken in sufficient quantity, is capable of producing\r\nvery dangerous and terrible symptoms. It is however much employed in the\r\npresent days as an anodyne. Dr. Withering found it of great advantage in\r\na case of difficult deglutition. Stoerck and some others recommend this\r\nextract in the dose of one grain or two; but Dr. Cullen observes, that\r\nhe seldom discovered its anodyne effects till he had proceeded to doses\r\nof eight or ten grains, and sometimes to fifteen and even to twenty. The\r\nleaves of Henbane are said to have been applied externally with\r\nadvantage, in the way of poultice, to resolve scirrhous tumours, and to\r\nremove some pains of the rheumatic and arthritic kind.\r\n\r\nSimilar Plants.--Verbascum Lychnites; V. nigrum.\r\n\r\nThe roots of the Henbane are to be distinguished by their very powerful\r\nand narcotic scent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n218. HYSSOPUS officinalis. HYSSOP. The Herb. L. E. D.--The leaves of\r\nHyssop have an aromatic smell, and a warm pungent taste. Besides the\r\ngeneral virtues of aromatics, they are particularly recommeded in\r\nhumoral asthmas, coughs, and other disorders of the breast and lungs;\r\nand said to notably promote expectoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n219. INULA Helenium. ELECAMPANE. Root. D.--Elecampane root possesses the\r\ngeneral virtues of alexipharmics: it is principally recommended for\r\npromoting expectoration in humoural asthmas and coughs; in which\r\nintention, it used to be employed in the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia:\r\nliberally taken, it is said to excite urine, and loosen the belly. In\r\nsome parts of Germany, large quantities of this root are candied, and\r\nused as a stomachic, for strengthening the tone of the viscera in\r\ngeneral, and for attenuating tenacious juices. Spiritous liquors extract\r\nits virtues in greater perfection than watery ones: the former scarce\r\nelevate any thing in distillation: with the latter, an essential oil\r\narises, which concretes into white flakes; this possesses at first the\r\nflavour of the elecampane, but is very apt to lose it in keeping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n220. JUNIPERUS Sabina. SAVINE. The Tops. L. E. D.--Savine is a warm\r\nirritating aperient medicine, capable of promoting all the glandular\r\nsecretions. The distilled oil is one of the most powerful emmenagogues;\r\nand is found of good service in obstructions of the uterus, or other\r\nviscra, proceeding from a laxity and weakness of the vessels, or a cold\r\nsluggish indisposition of the juices.\r\n\r\nSimilar Plants.--Juniperus oxycedrus; J. Phoenicea. These should be\r\nparticularly distinguished, as Savine is attended with danger when taken\r\nimmoderately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n221. JUNIPERUS communis. JUNIPER. Berries. L. E. D.--Juniper berries\r\nhave a strong, not disagreeable smell; and a warm, pungent sweet taste,\r\nwhich, if they are long chewed, or previously well bruised, is followed\r\nby a bitterish one. The pungency seems to reside in the bark; the sweet\r\nin the juice; the aromatic flavour in oily vesicles, spread through the\r\nsubstance of the pulp, and distinguishable even by the eye; and the\r\nbitter in the seeds: the fresh berries yield, on expression, a rich,\r\nsweet, honey-like, aromatic juice; if previously pounded so as to break\r\nthe seeds, the juice proves tart and bitter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n222. LACTUCA virosa. WILD LETTUCE. Leaves. E.--Dr. Collin at Vienna\r\nfirst brought the Lactuca virosa into medical repute; and its character\r\nhas lately induced the College of Physicians at Edinburgh to insert it\r\nin the Catalogue of the Materia Medica. More than twenty-four cases of\r\ndropsy are said by Collin to have been successfully treated, by\r\nemploying an extract prepared from the expressed juice of this plant,\r\nwhich is stated not only to be powerfully diuretic, but, by attenuating\r\nthe viscid humours, to promote all the secretions, and to remove\r\nvisceral obstructions. In the more simple cases proceeding from\r\ndebility, the extract in doses of eighteen to thirty grains a-day,\r\nproved sufficient to accomplish a cure; but when the disease was\r\ninveterate, and accompanied with visceral obstructions, the quantity of\r\nextract was increased to three drams; nor did larger doses, though they\r\nexcited nausea, ever produce any other bad effect; and the patients\r\ncontinued so strong under the use of this remedy, that it was seldom\r\nnecessary to employ any tonic medicines.--Woodville's Med. Bot. p. 76.\r\n\r\nSimilar Plants.--Sonchus arvensis; Lactuca Scariola.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n223. LAVANDULA Spica. LAVENDER. Flowers. L. D.--Lavender has been an\r\nofficinal plant for a considerable time, though we have no certain\r\naccounts of it given by the ancients. Its medical virtue resides in the\r\nessential oil, which is supposed to be a gentle corroborant and\r\nstimulant of the aromatic kind; and is recommended in nervous\r\ndebilities, and various affections proceeding from a want of energy in\r\nthe animal functions.--Woodville's Med. Bot. p. 323.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n224. LAURUS nobilis. BAY-TREE. Leaves and Berries. L.--In distillation\r\nwith water, the leaves of bay yield a small quantity of very fragrant\r\nessential oil; with rectified spirit, they afford a moderately warm\r\npungent extract. The berries yield a larger quantity of essential oil:\r\nthey discover likewise a degree of unctuosity in the mouth; give out to\r\nthe press an almost insipid fluid oil; and on being boiled in water, a\r\nthicker butyraceous one of a yellowish-green colour, impregnated with\r\nthe flavour of the berry. An infusion of the leaves is sometimes drunk\r\nas tea; and the essential oil of the berries may be given from one to\r\nfive or six drops on sugar, or dissolved by means of mucilages, or in\r\nspirit of wine.--Woodville's Med Bot. p. 680, 681.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n225. LAURUS Sassafras. SASSAFRAS-TREE. Bark. L. E. D.--Its medical\r\ncharacter was formerly held in great estimation; and its sensible\r\nqualities, which are stronger than any of the woods, may have probably\r\ncontributed to establish the opinion so generally entertained of its\r\nutility in many inveterate diseases: for, soon after its introduction\r\ninto Europe, it was sold at a very high price, and its virtues were\r\nextolled in publications professedly written on the subject. It is now,\r\nhowever, thought to be of very little importance, and seldom employed\r\nbut in conjunction with other medicines of a more powerful nature.\r\n\r\nDr. Cullen found that a watery infusion of it taken warm and pretty\r\nlargely, was very effectual in promoting sweat; but he adds, \"to what\r\nparticular purpose this sweating was applicable, I have not been able to\r\ndetermine.\" In some constitutions sassafras, by its extreme fragrance,\r\nis said to produce headache: to deprive it of this effect, the decoction\r\nought to be employed.--Woodville's Mat. Med. p. 677.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n226. LEONTODON Taraxicum. N EBION. Root. L.--The roots contain a bitter\r\nmilky juice; they promise to be of use as asperient and detergent\r\nmedicines; and have sometimes been directed in this intention with good\r\nsuccess. Boerhaave esteems them capable, if duly continued, of resolving\r\nalmost all kinds of coagulations, and opening very obstinate\r\nobstructions of the viscera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n227. LINUM usitatissimum. FLAX. The Seeds. L. E.--Linseed yields to the\r\npress a considerable quantity of oil; and boiled in water, a strong\r\nmucilage: these are occasionally made use of for the same purposes as\r\nother substances of that class; and sometimes the seeds themselves in\r\nemollient and maturating cataplasms. They have also been employed in\r\nAsia, and, in times of scarcity, in Europe, as food: but are not\r\nagreeable, or in general wholesome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n228. LINUM catharticum. PURGING-FLAX. The Herb. L. D.-This is a very\r\nsmall plant, not above four or five inches high, found wild upon chalky\r\nhills, and in dry pasture-grounds. Its virtue is expressed in its title:\r\nan infusion in water or whey of a handful of the fresh leaves, or a dram\r\nof them in substance when dried, is said to purge without inconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n229. LOBELIA siphylitica. BLUE CARDINAL FLOWER. The Root. E.--Every part\r\nof the plant abounds with a milky juice, and has a rank smell. The root,\r\nwhich is the part directed for medicinal use, in taste resembles\r\ntobacco, and is apt to excite vomiting. It derived its name,\r\nSiphylitica, from its efficacy in the cure of Siphylis, as experienced\r\nby the North American Indians, who considered it a specific to that\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nA decoction was made of a handful of the roots in three measures of\r\nwater. Of this, half a measure is taken in the morning fasting, and\r\nrepeated in the evening; and the dose is gradually increased till its\r\npurgative effects become too violent, when the decoction is to be\r\nintermitted for a day or two, and then renewed till a perfect cure is\r\neffected. But it does not appear that the antisiphylitic powers of\r\nLobelia have been confirmed by any instances of European practice.--\r\nWoodville's Med. Bot. p. 251.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n230. LYTHRUM Salicaria. WILLOW HERB. The Herb. D.--This is used\r\ninternally in dropsies, obstinate gleets, and leucorrhoea.\r\n\r\nSimilar Plants.--Epilobium palustre; Epilob. angustifolium; Epilob.\r\nhirsutum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n231. MALVA sylvestris. COMMON MALLOW. Herb. L. E.--The leaves are ranked\r\nthe first of the four emollient herbs: they were formerly of some\r\nesteem, in food, for loosening the belly; at present, decoctions of them\r\nare sometimes employed in dysenteries, heat and sharpness of urine, and\r\nin general for obtunding acrimonious humours: their principal use is in\r\nemollient glysters, cataplasms, and fomentations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n232. MARRUBIUM vulgare. HORFHOUND. Herb. E. D.--It is greatly extolled\r\nfor its efficacy in removing obstructions of the lungs and other\r\nviscera. It has chiefly been employed in humoural asthmas. Mention is\r\nmade of its successful use in scirrhous affections of the liver,\r\njaundice, cachexies, and menstrual suppressions.--Woodville's Med. Bot.\r\np. 333.\r\n\r\nSimilar Plants.--Ballota nigra; B. alba.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n233. MELISSA officinalis. BALM. Herb. L. E.--This herb, in its recent\r\nstate, has a weak roughish aromatic taste, and a pleasant smell,\r\nsomewhat of the lemon kind. On distilling the fresh herb with water, it\r\nimpregnates the first runnings pretty strongly with its grateful\r\nflavour. Prepared as tea, however, it makes a grateful diluent drink in\r\nfevers; and in this way it is commonly used, either by itself, or\r\nacidulated with the juice of lemons.--Woodville's Med. Bot. p. 335, 336.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n234. MENTHA viridis. SPEAR-MINT. Leaves. L. D.--The virtues of Mint are\r\nthose of a warm stomachic and carminative: in loss of appetite, nauseae,\r\ncontinual retchings to vomit, and (as Boerhaave expresses it) almost\r\nparalytic weakness of the stomach, there are few simples perhaps of\r\nequal efficacy. In colicky pains, the gripes to which children are\r\nsubject, lienteries, and other kinds of immoderate fluxes, this plant\r\nfrequently does good service. It likewise proves beneficial in sundry\r\nhysteric cases, and affords an useful cordial in languors and other\r\nweaknesses consequent upon delivery. The best preparations for these\r\npurposes are, a strong infusion made from the dry leaves in water (which\r\nis much superior to one from the green herb) or rather a tincture or\r\nextract prepared with rectified spirit.\r\n\r\nThe essential oil, a simple and spirituous water, and a conserve, are\r\nkept in the shops: the Edinburgh College directs an infusion of the\r\nleaves in the distilled water. This herb is an ingredient also in the\r\nthree alexitereal waters; and its essential oil in the stomach plaster\r\nand stomach pills.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n235. MENTHA Piperita. PEPPER-MINT. Herb. L. E. D.--The leaves have a\r\nmore penetrating smell than any of the other mints, and a much warmer,\r\npungent, glowing taste like pepper, sinking as it were into the tongue.\r\nThe principal use of this herb is in flatulent colics, languors, and\r\nother like disorders; it seems to act as soon as taken, and extends its\r\neffects through the whole system, instantly communicating a glowing\r\nwarmth. Water extracts the whole of the pungency of this herb by\r\ninfusion, and elevates it in distillation. Its officinal preparations\r\nare an essential oil, and a simple and spirituous water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n236. MENTHA Pulegium. PENNYROYAL. Herb. L. E. D.--Pennyroyal is a warm\r\npungent herb of the aromatic kind, similar to mint, but more acrid and\r\nless agreeable. It has long been held in great esteem, and not\r\nundeservedly, as an aperient and deobstruent, particularly in hysteric\r\ncomplaints, and suppressions of the uterine purgations. For these\r\npurposes, the distilled water is generally made use of, or, what is of\r\nequal efficacy, an infusion of the leaves. It is observable, that both\r\nwater and rectified spirit extract the virtues of this herb by infusion,\r\nand likewise elevate greatest part of them in distillation.--Lewis's\r\nMat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n237. MENYANTHES trifoliata. BUCK-BEAN. Leaves. L. E. D.--This is an\r\nefficacious aperient and deobstruent; it promotes the fluid secretions,\r\nand, if liberally taken, gently loosens the belly. It has of late gained\r\ngreat reputation in scorbutic and scrophulous disorders; and its good\r\neffects in these cases have been warranted by experience: inveterate\r\ncutaneous diseases have been removed by an infusion of the leaves, drunk\r\nto the quantity of a pint a-day, at proper intervals, and continued some\r\nweeks. Boerhaave relates, that he was relieved of the gout by drinking\r\nthe juice mixed with whey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n238. MOMORDICA Elaterium. SPIRTING CUCUMBER. Fruit L. E. D.--Elaterium\r\nis a strong cathartic, and very often operates also upwards. Two or\r\nthree grains are accounted in most cases a sufficient dose. Simon Paulli\r\nrelates some instances of the good effects of this purgative in\r\ndropsies: but cautions practitioners not to have recourse to it till\r\nafter milder medicines have proved ineffectual; to which caution we\r\nheartily subscribe. Medicines indeed in general, which act with violence\r\nin a small dose, require the utmost skill to manage them with any\r\ntolerable degree of safety: to which may be added, that the various\r\nmanners of making these kinds of preparations, as practised by different\r\nhands, must needs vary their power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n239. MORUS nigra. MULBERRY. Fruit. L.--It has the common qualities of\r\nthe other sweet fruits, abating heat, quenching thirst, and promoting\r\nthe grosser secretions; an agreeable syrup made from the juice is kept\r\nin the shops. The bark of the roots has been in considerable esteem as a\r\nvermifuge; its taste is bitter, and somewhat astringent.--Lewis's Mat.\r\nMed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n240. NICOTIANA Tabacum. TOBACCO. Leaves. L. E. D.--Tobacco is sometimes\r\nused externally in unguents for destroying cutaneous insects, cleansing\r\nold ulcers, &c. Beaten into a mash with vinegar or brandy, it has\r\nsometimes proved serviceable for removing hard tumours of the\r\nhypochondres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n241. ORIGANUM Majorana. SWEET MARJORAM. Herb. L. E.-It is a moderately\r\nwarm aromatic, yielding its virtues both to aqueous and spirituous\r\nliquors by infusion, and to water in distillation. It is principally\r\ncelebrated in disorders of old people. An essential oil of the herb is\r\nkept in the shops. The powder of the leaves proves an agreeable errhine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n242. ORIGANUM vulgare. POT MARJORAM. Herb. L. D.--It has an agreeable\r\naromatic smell approaching to that of marjoram, and a pungent taste much\r\nresembling thyme, to which it is likewise thought to be more nearly\r\nallied in its medicinal qualities than to any of the other verticillatae,\r\nand therefore deemed to be emmenagogue, tonic, stomachic, &c.\r\n\r\nThe dried leaves used instead of tea are said to be extremely grateful.\r\nThey are also employed in medicated baths and fomentations.--Woodville's\r\nMed. Bot. p. 345.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n243. OXALIS Acetosella. WOOD SORREL. Herb. L.--In taste and medical\r\nqualities it is similar to the common sorrel, but considerably more\r\ngrateful, and hence is preferred by the London College. Boiled with\r\nmilk, it forms an agreeable whey; and beaten with sugar, a very elegant\r\nconserve.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n244. PAPAVER Rhoeas. RED POPPY. Petals. L. E. D.--The flowers of this\r\nplant yield upon expression a deep red juice, and impart the same colour\r\nby infusion to aqueous liquors. A syrup of them is kept in the shops:\r\nthis is valued chiefly for its colour; though some expect from it a\r\nlightly anodyne virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n245. PAPAVER somniferum. OPIUM POPPY. Gum. L. E. D.-Poppy heads, boiled\r\nin water, impart to the menstruum their narcotic juice, together with\r\nthe other juices which they have in common with vegetable matters in\r\ngeneral. The liquor strongly pressed out, suffered to settle, clarified\r\nwith whites of eggs, and evaporated to a due consistence, yields about\r\none-fifth or one-sixth the weight of the heads, of extract. This\r\npossesses the virtues of opium; but requires to be given in double its\r\ndose to answer the same intention, which it is said to perform without\r\noccasioning nausea and giddiness, the usual consequences of the other.\r\n\r\nThe general effects of this medicine are, to relax the solids, ease\r\npain, procure sleep, promote perspiration, but restrain all other\r\nevacuations. When its operation is over, the pain, and other symptoms\r\nwhich it had for a time abated, return; and generally with greater\r\nviolence than before, unless the cause has been removed by the\r\ndiaphoresis or relaxation which it occasioned.\r\n\r\nThe operation of opium is generally attended with a slow, but strong and\r\nfull pulse, a dryness of the mouth, a redness and light itching of the\r\nskin: and followed by a degree of nausea, a difficulty of respiration,\r\nlowness of the spirits, and a weak languid pulse.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the dose of opium, one grain is generally sufficient, and\r\noften too large a one; maniacal persons, and those who have been long\r\naccustomed to take it, require three or more grains to have the due\r\neffect. Among the eastern nations, who are habituated to opium, a dram\r\nis but a moderate dose: Garcias relates, that he knew one who every day\r\ntook ten drams. Those who have been long accustomed to its use, upon\r\nleaving it off, are seized with great lowness, languor, and anxiety;\r\nwhich are relieved by having again recourse to opium, and, in some\r\nmeasure, by wine or spirituous liquors.\r\n\r\nSimilar Plants.--Papaver hybridum; P. Argemone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n246. PASTINACA Opoponax. OPOPONAX, or CANDY CARROT. Gum Opoponax. L.--\r\nThe juice is brought from Turkey and the East Indies, sometimes in round\r\ndrops or tears, but more commonly in irregular lumps, of a\r\nreddish-yellow colour on the outside, with specks of white, inwardly of\r\na paler colour, and frequently variegated with large white pieces.\r\n\r\nBoerhaave frequently employed it, along with ammoniacum and galbanum, in\r\nhypochondriacal disorders, obstructions of the abdominal viscera from a\r\nsluggishness of mucous humours, and a want of due elasticity of the\r\nsolids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n247. PIMPINELLA Anisum. ANISEED. The Seeds. L. E. D.-These seeds are in\r\nthe number of the four greater hot seeds: their principal use is in cold\r\nflatulent disorders, where tenacious phlegm abounds, and in the gripes\r\nto which young children are subject. Frederick Hoffman strongly\r\nrecommends them in weakness of the stomach, diarrhoeas, and for\r\nstrengthening the tone of the viscera in general; and thinks they well\r\ndeserve the appellation given them by Helmont, intestinorum solamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n248. PINUS sylvestris. SCOTCH FIR. Tar, yellow Resin, and Turpentine. L.\r\nD.--Tar, which is well known from its oeconomical uses, is properly an\r\nempyreumatic oil of turpentine, and has been much used as a medicine,\r\nboth internally and externally. Tar-water, or water impregnated with the\r\nmore soluble parts of tar, was some time ago a very popular remedy in\r\nvarious obstinate disorders, both acute and chronic, especially in\r\nsmall-pox, scurvy, ulcers, fistulas, rheumatisms, &c.\r\n\r\nTurpentine is an extract also from the same tree, which is used for\r\nvarious purposes of medicine and the arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n249. PINUS Abies. SPRUCE-FIR. Burgundy Pitch. L. E. D.--This is entirely\r\nconfined to external use, and was formerly an ingredient in several\r\nointments and plasters. In inveterate coughs, affections of the lungs,\r\nand other internal complaints, plasters of this resin, by acting as a\r\ntropical stimulus, are frequently found of considerable service.--\r\nWoodville's Med. Bot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n250. POLYGONUM Bistorta. BISTORT. The Roots. L. E. D.--All the parts of\r\nbistort have a rough austere taste, particularly the root, which is one\r\nof the strongest of the vegetable stringents. It is employed in all\r\nkinds of immoderate haemorrhages and other fluxes, both internally and\r\nexternally, where astringency is the only intention. It is certainly a\r\nvery powerful styptic, and is to be looked on simply as such; the\r\nsudorific, antipestilential, and other like virtues attributed to it, it\r\nhas no other claim to, than in consequence of this property, and of the\r\nantiseptic power which it has in common with other vegetable styptics.\r\nThe largest dose of the root in powder is one dram.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n251. PRUNUS domestica. FRENCH PRUNES. The Fruit. L. E. D.--The medical\r\neffects of the damson and common prunes are, to abate heat, and gently\r\nloosen the belly: which they perform by lubricating the passage, and\r\nsoftening the excrement. They are of considerable service in costiveness\r\naccompanied with heat or irritation, which the more stimulating\r\ncathartics would tend to aggravate: where prunes are not of themselves\r\nsufficient, their effects may be promoted by joining with them a little\r\nrhubarb or the like; to which may be added some carminative ingredient,\r\nto prevent their occasioning flatulencies. Prunelloes have scarce any\r\nlaxative quality: these are mild grateful refrigerants, and, by being\r\noccasionally kept in the mouth, usefully allay the thirst of hydropic\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n252. PUNICA Granatum. POMEGRANATE. Rind of the Fuit. L. E. D.--This\r\nfruit has the general qualities of the other sweet summer fruits,\r\nallaying heat, quenching thirst, and gently loosening the belly. The\r\nrind is a strong astringent, and as such is occasionally made use of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n253. PYRUS Cydonia. QUINCE. The Kernels. L.--The seeds abound with a\r\nmucilaginous substance, of no particular taste, which they readily\r\nimpart to watery liquors: an ounce will render three pints of water\r\nthick and ropy like the white of an egg. A syrup and jelly of the fruit,\r\nand mucilage of the seeds, used to be kept in the shops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n254. QUEROUS pedunculata. OAK. Bark. L. E. D.--This bark is a strong\r\nastringent; and hence stands recommended in haemorrhagies, alvine fluxes,\r\nand other preternatural or immoderate secretions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n255. RHAMNUS catharticus. BUCKTHORN. Berries. L. E.--Buckthorn-berries\r\nhave a faint disagreeable smell, and a nauseous bitter taste. They have\r\nlong been in considerable esteem as cathartics; and celebrated in\r\ndropsies, rheumatisms, and even in the gout; though in these cases they\r\nhave no advantage above other purgatives, and are more offensive, and\r\noperate more churlishly, than many which the shops are furnished with:\r\nthey generally occasion gripes, sickness, dry the mouth and throat, and\r\nleave a thirst of long duration. The dose is about twenty of the fresh\r\nberries in substance, and twice or thrice this number in decoction, an\r\nounce of the expressed juice, or a dram of the dried berries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n256. RHEUM palmatum. TURKEY RHUBARB. Roots. L. E. D.--Rhubarb is a mild\r\ncathartic, which operates without violence or irritation, and may be\r\ngiven with safety even to pregnant women and to children. In some\r\npeople, however, it always occasions severe griping. Besides its\r\npurgative quality, it is celebrated for an astringent one, by which it\r\nstrengthens the tone of the stomach and intestines, and proves useful in\r\ndiarrhoea and disorders proceeding from a laxity of the fibres. Rhubarb\r\nin substance operates more powerfully as a cathartic than any of the\r\npreparations of it. Watery tinctures purge more than the spirituous\r\nones; whilst the latter contain in greater perfection the aromatic,\r\nastringent, and corroborating virtues of the rhubarb. The dose, when\r\nintended as a purgative, is from a scruple to a dram or more.\r\n\r\nThe Turkey rhubarb is, among us, universally preferred to the East India\r\nsort.\r\n\r\nThe plant is common in our gardens, but their medicinal powers are much\r\nweaker than in those from abroad.\r\n\r\nRHODODENDRON Chrysanthemum. YELLOW-FLOWERED RHODODENDRON. See No. 290.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n257. RHUS Toxicodendron. POISON-OAK. Leaves. L. E.--Of considerable use\r\nin paralytic affections, and is much used in the present day.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, often substituted by the Rhus radicans, which has not\r\nthe medical properties that this plant has; and it is to be regretted\r\nthat the leaves of both species are so much alike, that, when gathered,\r\nthey are not to be distinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n258. RICINUS communis. PALMA CHRISTI. Seeds and Oil. L. E. D.--The oil,\r\ncommonly called nut or castor oil, is got by expression, retains\r\nsomewhat of the mawkishness and acrimony of the nut; but is, in general,\r\na safe and mild laxative in cases where we wish to avoid irritation, as\r\nin those of colic, calculus, gonorrhoea, &c. and some likewise use it as\r\na purgative in worm-cases. Half an ounce or an ounce commonly answers\r\nwith an adult, and a dram or two with an infant. The castor oil which is\r\nimported is not so good as the expressed oil from the nut made in this\r\ncountry. The disagreeable taste is from the coats of the seeds; the best\r\nkind is pressed out after the seeds are decorticated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n259. ROSA centifolia. DAMASK ROSE. Petals. L. E. D.--In distillation\r\nwith water, it yields a small portion of a butyraceous oil, whose\r\nflavour exactly resembles that of the roses. This oil, and the distilled\r\nwater, are very useful and agreeable cordials. Hoffmann strongly\r\nrecommends them as of singular efficacy for raising the strength,\r\ncheering and recruiting the spirits, and allaying pain; which they\r\nperform without raising any heat in the constitution, rather abating it\r\nwhen inordinate. Although the damask rose is recommended by Dr.\r\nWoodville, yet, having grown this article for sale, I find that the\r\npreference is always given to the Provence rose by those who distil\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n260. ROSA gallica. RED OFFICINAL ROSE. Petals. L. E. D.-This has very\r\nlittle of the fragrance of the foregoing sort; it is a mild and grateful\r\nastringent, especially before the flower has opened: this is\r\nconsiderably improved by hasty exsiccation, but both the astringency and\r\ncolour are impaired by slow drying. In the shops are prepared a conserve\r\nand a tincture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n261. ROSA canina. DOG-ROSE. The Pulp of the Fruit. L. E.-The fruit,\r\ncalled heps or hips, has a sourish taste, and obtains a place in the\r\nLondon Pharmacopoeia in the form of a conserve: for this purpose, the\r\nseeds and chaffy fibres are to be carefully removed; for, if these\r\nprickly fibres are not entirely scraped off from the internal surface of\r\nthe hips, the conserve is liable to produce considerable irritation on\r\nthe primae viae.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n262. ROSMARINUS officinalis. ROSEMARY. Tops. L. E. D.--Rosemary has a\r\nfragrant smell and a warm pungent bitterish taste, approaching to those\r\nof lavender: the leaves and tender tops are strongest; next to these the\r\ncup of the flower; the flowers themselves are considerably the weakest,\r\nbut most pleasant. Aqueous liquors extract great share of the virtues of\r\nrosemary leaves by infusion, and elevate them in distillation: along\r\nwith the water arises a considerable quantity of essential oil, of an\r\nagreeable strong penetrating smell. Pure spirit extracts in great\r\nperfection the whole aromatic flavour of the rosemary, and elevates very\r\nlittle of it in distillation: hence the resinous mass left upon\r\nabstracting the spirit, proves an elegant aromatic, very rich in the\r\npeculiar qualities of the plant. The flowers of rosemary give over great\r\npart of their flavour in distillation with pure spirit; by watery\r\nliquors, their fragrance is much injured; by beating, destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n263. RUBIA tinctorum. MADDER. Roots. L. E. D.--It has little or no\r\nsmell; a sweetish taste, mixed with a little bitterness. The virtues\r\nattributed to it are those of a detergent and aperient; whence it has\r\nbeen usually ranked among the opening roots, and recommended in\r\nobstructions of the viscera, particularly of the kidneys, in\r\ncoagulations of the blood from falls or bruises, in the jaundice, and\r\nbeginning dropsies.\r\n\r\nIt is observable, that this root, taken internally, tinges the urine of\r\na deep red colour; and in the Philosophical Transactions we have an\r\naccount of its producing a like effect upon the bones of animals which\r\nhad it mixed with their food: all the bones, particularly the more solid\r\nones, were changed, both externally and internally, to a deep red, but\r\nneither the fleshy nor cartilaginous parts suffered any alteration: some\r\nof these bones macerated in water for many weeks together, and\r\nafterwards steeped and boiled in spirit of wine, lost none of their\r\ncolour, nor communicated any tinge to the liquors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n264. RUMEX Acetosa. SORREL. Leaves. L.--These have an agreeable acid\r\ntaste. They have the same medicinal qualities as the Oxalis Acetosella,\r\nand are employed for the same purposes.\r\n\r\nSorrel taken in considerable quantities, or used prepared for food, will\r\nbe found of great advantage when a refrigerant and antiscorbutic regimen\r\nis required.--Woodville's Med. Bot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n265. RUTA graveolens. RUE. Leaves. L. E. D.--These are powerfully\r\nstimulating, attenuating, and detergent: and hence, in cold phlegmatic\r\nhabits, they quicken the circulation, dissolve tenacious juices, open\r\nobstructions of the excretory glands, and promote the fluid secretions.\r\nThe writers on the Materia Medica in general have entertained a very\r\nhigh opinion of the virtues of this pant. Boerhaave is full of its\r\npraises; particularly of the essential oil, and the distilled water\r\ncohobated or redistilled several times from fresh parcels of the herb:\r\nafter somewhat extravagantly commending other waters prepared in this\r\nmanner, he adds, with regard to that of rue, that the greatest\r\ncommendations he can bestow upon it fall short of its merit: \"What\r\nmedicine (says he) can be more efficacious for promoting perspiration,\r\nin cases of epilepsies, and for expelling poison?\" Whatever service rue\r\nmay be of generally, it undoubtedly has its use in the two last cases:\r\nthe cohobated water, however, is not the most efficacious preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n266. SALIX fragilis. CRACK WILLOW. Bark. L. D.-The bark of the branches\r\nof this tree manifests a considerable degree of bitterness to the taste,\r\nand is also astringent; hence it has been thought a good substitute for\r\nthe Peruvian bark, and, upon trial, was found to stop the paroxysms of\r\nintermittents: it is likewise recommended in other cases requiring tonic\r\nor astringent remedies. Not only the bark of this species of Salix, but\r\nthat of several others, possess similar qualities, particularly of the\r\nSalix alba pentandria, and capraea, all of which are recommended in\r\nforeign Pharmacopoeias. But, in our opinion, the bark of the Salix\r\ntriandria is more effectual than that of any other of this genus; at\r\nleast, its sensible qualities give it a decided preference.--Woodville's\r\nMed Bot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n267. SALVIA officinalis. GREEN AND RED SAGE. Herb. E. D.--Its effects\r\nare, to moderately warm and strengthen the vessels; and hence, in cold\r\nphlegmatic habits, it excites appetite, and proves serviceable in\r\ndebilities of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nThe red sage, mixed with honey and vinegar, is used for a gargle in sore\r\nthroats. Aqueous infusions of the leaves, with the addition of a little\r\nlemon juice, prove an useful diluting drink in febrile disorders, of an\r\nelegant colour, and sufficiently acceptable to the palate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n268. SAMBUCUS nigra. COMMON ELDER. Flowers and Berries. L. E. D.--The\r\nparts of the Sambucus which are proposed for medicinal use in the\r\nPharmacopoeias, are the inner bark, the flowers, and the berries. The\r\nflowers have an agreeable flavour, which they give over in distillation\r\nwith water, and impart by infusion, both to water and rectified spirit:\r\non distilling a large quantitiy of them with water, a small portion of a\r\nbutyraceous essential oil separates. Infusions made from the fresh\r\nflowers are gently laxative and aperient; when dry, they are said to\r\npromote chiefly the cuticular excretion, and to be particularly\r\nserviceable in erysipetalous and eruptive disorders.--Woodville's Med.\r\nBot. 598.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n269. SCILLA maritima. SQUILL. Root. L. E. D.--This root is to the taste\r\nvery nauseous, intensely bitter and acrimonious; much handled, it\r\nexulcerates the skin. With regard to its medical virtues, it powerfully\r\nstimulates the solids, and attenuates viscid juices; and by these\r\nqualities promotes expectoration, urine, and perspiration: if the dose\r\nis considerable, it proves emetic, and sometimes purgative. The\r\nprincipal use of this medicine is where the primae viae abound with mucous\r\nmatter, and the lungs are oppressed by tenacious phlegm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n270. SCROPHULARIA nodosa. KNOTTY FIGWORT. Herb. D.--The roots are of a\r\nwhite colour, full of little knobs or protuberances on the surface: this\r\nappearance gained it formerly some repute against scrophulous disorders\r\nand the piles; and from hence it received its name: but modern\r\npractitioners expect no such virtues from it. It has a faint unpleasant\r\nsmell, and a somewhat bitter disagreeable taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n271. SINAPIS nigra. BLACK MUSTARD. Seeds. L. E. D.--By writers on the\r\nMateria Medica, mustard is considered to promote appetite, assist\r\ndigestion, attenuate viscid juices, and, by stimulating the fibres, to\r\nprove a general remedy in paralytic and rheumatic affections. Joined to\r\nits stimulant qualities, it frequently, if taken in considerable\r\nquantity, opens the body, and increases the urinary discharge; and hence\r\nhas been found useful in dropsical complaints.--Woodville's Med. Bot. p.\r\n404.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n272. SINAPIS alba. WHITE MUSTARD. Seeds. L. E. D.--These have been\r\nrecommended to be taken whole in cases of rheumatism and have been known\r\nto produce considerable relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n273. SISYMBRIUM Nasturtium. WATER-CRESSES. Herb. E.-Hoffman recommends\r\nthis as of singular efficacy for accelerating the circulation,\r\nstrengthening the viscera, opening obstructions of the glands, promoting\r\nthe fluid secretions, and purifying the blood and humours: for these\r\npurposes, the expressed juice, which contains the peculiar taste and\r\npungency of the herb, may be taken in doses of an ounce or two, and\r\ncontinued for a considerable time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n274. SIUM nodiflorum. CREEPING WATER-PARSNEP. The Root. D.-This plant\r\nhas not been admitted into the Materia Medica of any of the\r\nPharmacopoeias which we have seen, except that of the London College,\r\ninto which it was received in the character of an antiscorbutic, or\r\nrather as the corrector of acrid humours, especially when manifested by\r\ncutaneous eruptions and tumours in the lymphatic system, for which we\r\nhave the testimony of Beirie and Ray; but the best proofs of its\r\nefficacy are the following given by Dr. Withering: \"A young lady, six\r\nyears old, was cured of an obstinate disease by taking three large\r\nspoonfuls of the juice twice-a-day; and I have repeatedly given to\r\nadults three or four ounces every morning in similar complaints with the\r\ngreatest advantage. It is not nauseous; and children take it readily if\r\nmixed with milk. In the dose I have given, it neither affects the head,\r\nthe stomach, nor the bowels.\" Woodville's Med. Bot. 146.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n275. SMILAX Sarsaparilla. SARSAPARILLA. Root. L. E. D.--This root was\r\nfirst brought into Europe by the Spaniards, about the year 1565, with\r\nthe character of a specific for the cure of the lues venerea, which made\r\nits appearance a little before that time, and likewise of several\r\nobstinate chronic disorders. Whatever good effects it might have\r\nproduced in the warmer climates, it proved unsuccessful in this. It\r\nappears, however, from experience, that though greatly unequal to the\r\ncharacter which it bore at first, it is in some cases of considerable\r\nuse as a sudorific, where more acrid medicines are improper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n276. SOLANUM Dulcamara. BITTERSWEET. Stalk. L. D.--The taste of the\r\ntwigs and roots, as the name of the plant expresses, is both bitter and\r\nsweet; the bitterness being first perceived, and the sweet afterwards.\r\nThey are commended for resolving coagulated blood, and as a cathartic,\r\ndiuretic, and deobstruent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n277. SOLIDAGO Virga aurea. GOLDEN ROD. Flowers and Leaves. D.--The\r\nleaves have a moderately astringent bitter taste, and hence prove\r\nserviceable in debility and laxity of the viscera, and disorders\r\nproceeding from that cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n278. SPARTIUM scoparium. BROOM. Tops and Seeds. L. D.-These have a\r\nnauseous bitter taste: decoctions of them loosen the belly, promote\r\nurine, and stand recommended in hydropic cases. The flowers are said to\r\nprove cathartic in decoction, and emetic in substance, though in some\r\nplaces, as Lobel informs us, they are commonly used, and in large\r\nquantity, in salads, without producing any effect of this kind. The\r\nqualities of the seeds are little better determined: some report that\r\nthey purge almost as strongly as hellebore, in the dose of a dram and a\r\nhalf; whilst the author above mentioned relates, that he has given a\r\ndecoction of two ounces of them as a gentle emetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n279. SPIGELLA marylandica. WORM GRASS. Root. L. E. D.-About forty years\r\nago, the anthelmintic virtues of the root of this plant were discovered\r\nby the Indians; since which time it has been much used here. I have\r\ngiven it in hundreds of cases, and have been very attentive to its\r\neffects. I never found it do much service, except when it proved gently\r\npurgative. Its purgative quality naturally led me to give it in febrile\r\ndiseases which seem to arise from viscidity in the primae viae; and in\r\nthese cases it succeeded to admiration, even when the sick did not void\r\nworms.\r\n\r\nTo a child of two years of age who had been taking ten grains of the\r\nroot twice a-day without having any other effect than making her dull\r\nand giddy, I prescribed twenty-two grains morning and evening, which\r\npurged her briskly, and brought away five large worms. [Communications\r\nfrom Dr. Gardner.]-Woodville's Med. Bot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n280. TANACETUM vulgare. TANSY. Herb. E. D.--Considered as a medicine, it\r\nis a moderately warm bitter, accompanied with a strong, not very\r\ndisagreeable flavour. Some have had a great opinion of it in hysteric\r\ndisorders, particularly those proceeding from a deficiency or\r\nsuppression of the usual course of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n281. TEUCRIUM Marum. CAT THYME. Herb. D.--The leaves have an aromatic\r\nbitterish taste; and, when rubbed betwixt the fingers, a quick pungent\r\nsmell, which soon affects the head, and occasions sneezing: distilled\r\nwith water, they yield a very acrid, penetrating essential oil,\r\nresembling one obtained by the same means from scurvy-grass. These\r\nqualities sufficiently point out the uses to which this plant might be\r\napplied; at present, it is little otherwise employed than in cephalic\r\nsnuffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n282. TEUCRIUM Chamaedrys. GERMANDER. Herb. D.--The leaves, tops, and\r\nseeds, have a bitter taste, with some degree of astringency and aromatic\r\nflavour. They were recommended as sudorific, diuretic, and emmenagogue,\r\nand for strengthening the stomach and viscera in general. With some they\r\nhave been in great esteem in intermittent fevers; as also in scrophulous\r\nand other chronic disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n283. TORMENTILLA erecta. TORMENTIL, or UPRIGHT SEPTFOIL. Root. L. E. D.\r\n--The root is the only part of this plant which is used medicinally; it\r\nhas a strong styptic taste, but imparts no peculiar sapid flavour. This\r\nhas been long held in great estimation as an astringent. Dr. Cullen has\r\nused it with gentian with great effect in intermittent fevers. Lewis\r\nrecommends an ounce and a half of the powdered root to be boiled in\r\nthree pints of water to a quart, adding towards the end of the boiling a\r\ndram of cinnamon. Of the strained liquor, sweetened with an ounce of any\r\nagreeable syrup, two ounces or more may be taken four or five times a-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n284. TUSSILAGO Farfara. COLTSFOOT. Herb. L. E. D.--Tussilago stands\r\nrecommended in coughs and other disorders of the breast and lungs: the\r\nflowers were an ingredient in the pectoral decoction of the Edinburgh\r\nPharmacopoeia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n285. VALERIANA officinalis. VALERIAN. Root. L. E. D.--Valerian is a\r\nmedicine of great use in nervous disorders, and is particularly\r\nserviceable in epilepsies proceeding from a debility in the nervous\r\nsystem. It was first brought into esteem in these cases by Fabius\r\nColumna, who by taking the powdered root, in the dose of half a\r\nspoonful, was cured of an inveterate epilepsy after many other medicines\r\nhad been tried in vain. Repeated experience has since confirmed its\r\nefficacy in this disorder; and the present practice lays considerable\r\nstress upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n286. VERATRUM album. WHITE HELLEBORE. Root. L. E. D.-The root has a\r\nnauseous, bitterish, acrid taste, burning the mouth and fauces: wounded\r\nwhen fresh, it emits an extremely acrimonious juice, which mixed with the\r\nblood, by a wound, is said to prove very dangerous: the powder of the\r\ndry root, applied to an issue, occasions violent purging: snuffed up the\r\nnose, it proves a strong, and not always a safe, sternutatory. This\r\nroot, taken internally, acts with extreme violence as an emetic, and has\r\nbeen observed, even in a small dose, to occasion convulsions and other\r\nterrible disorders. The ancients sometimes employed it in very obstinate\r\ncases, and always made this their last resource.\r\n\r\nSimilar Plant.--Gentiana lutea, which see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n287. VERONICA Beccabunga. BROOKLIME. Herb. L. D.--This plant was\r\nformerly considered of great use in several diseases, and was applied\r\nexternally to wounds and ulcers; but if it have any peculiar efficacy,\r\nit is to be derived from its antiscorbutic virtue.\r\n\r\nAs a mild refrigerant juice, it is preferred where an acrimonious state\r\nof the fluids prevails, indicated by prurient eruptions upon the skin,\r\nor in what has been called the hot scurvy.--Woodville's Med. Bot. 364.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n288. VITIS vinifera. GRAPE VINE. Raisins and different Wines. L. E.--\r\nThese are to cheer the spirits, warm the habit, promote perspiration,\r\nrender the vessels full and turgid, raise the pulse, and quicken the\r\ncirculation. The effects of the full-bodied wines are much more durable\r\nthan those of the thinner; all sweet wines, as Canary, abound with a\r\nglutinous nutritious substance; whilst the others are not nutrimental,\r\nor only accidentally so by strengthening the organs employed in\r\ndigestion: sweet wines in general do not pass off freely by urine, and\r\nheat the constitution more than an equal quantity of any other, though\r\ncontaining full as much spirit: red port, and most of the red wines,\r\nhave an astringent quality, by which they strengthen the tone of the\r\nstomach and intestines, and thus prove serviceable for restraining\r\nimmoderate secretions: those which are of an acid nature, as Renish,\r\npass freely by the kidneys, and gently loosen the belly: it is supposed\r\nthat these last exasperate, or occasion gout and calculous disorders,\r\nand that new wines of every kind have this effect.\r\n\r\nThe ripe fruit of grapes, of which there are several kinds, properly\r\ncured and dried, are the raisins and currants of the shops: the juice of\r\nthese also, by fermentation, affords wine as well as vinegar and tartar.\r\n\r\nThe medical use of raisins is, their imparting a very pleasant flavour\r\nboth to aqueous and spiritous menstrua. The seeds or stones are supposed\r\nto give a disagreeable relish, and hence are generally directed to be\r\ntaken out: nevertheless I have not found that they have any disagreeable\r\ntaste.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n289. ULMUS campestris. ELM. Bark. L. E. D.--The leaves have a bitterish\r\nastringent taste, and are recommended in powder, to the extent of at\r\nleast two drams a-day, in ulcerations of the urinary passages and\r\ncatarrhus vesicae. The powder has been used with opium, the latter being\r\ngradually increased to a considerable quantity, in diabetes, and it is\r\nsaid with advantage. Some use it for alleviating the dyspeptic symptoms\r\nin nephritic calculous ailments.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n290. RHODODENDRON Chrysanthemum. YELLOW-FLOWERED RHO-DODENDRON. E. The\r\nLeaves.--This species of Rhododendron has lately been introduced into\r\nBritain: it is a native of Siberia, affecting mountainous situations,\r\nand flowering in June and July.\r\n\r\nLittle attention was paid to this remedy till the year 1779, when it was\r\nstrongly recommended by Koelpin as an efficacious medicine, not only in\r\nrheumatism and gout, but even in venereal cases; and it is now very\r\ngenerally employed in chronic rheumatisms in various parts of Europe.\r\nThe leaves, which are the part directed for medicinal use, have a\r\nbitterish subastringent taste, and, as well as the bark and young\r\nbranches, manifest a degree of acrimony. Taken in large doses they prove\r\na narcotic poison, producing those symptoms which we have described as\r\noccasioned by many of the order Solanaceae.\r\n\r\nDr. Home, who tried it unsuccessfully in some cases of acute rheumatism,\r\nsays, it appears to be one of the most powerful sedatives which we have,\r\nas in most of the trials it made the pulse remarkably slow, and, in one\r\npatient, reduced it 38 beats. And in other cases in which the\r\nRhododendron has been used at Edinburgh, it has been productive of good\r\neffects; and, accordingly, it is now introduced into the Edinburgh\r\nPharmacopoeia.\r\n\r\nThe manner of using this plant by the Siberians was, by putting two\r\ndrams of the dried leaves in an earthen-pot with about ten ounces of\r\nboiling-water, keeping it near a boiling heat for a night, and this they\r\ntook in the morning; and by repeating it three or four times it\r\ngenerally affected a cure. It is said to occasion heat, thirst, a degree\r\nof delirium, and a peculiar sensation of the parts affected.--\r\nWoodville's Med. Bot. p. 239.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VIII.--MEDICINAL PLANTS not contained in either of the BRITISH\r\nDISPENSATORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the use of the Medical Student I selected in the foregoing section\r\nsuch plants as are contained in the Pharmacopoeias of the present day:\r\nbut there are many mentioned in Woodville's Medical Botany, Lewis's\r\nDispensatory, &c. which, although discarded from the College list, are\r\nnevertheless still used by medical practitioners and others.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to give a full history of all the plants that have\r\nfrom time to time been recommended for medical uses. The old writers, as\r\nGerard, Parkinson, Lyte, &c. attributed medical virtues to all the\r\nplants which came under their notice; and, on the other hand, as we\r\nobserved above, the vegetable department of the Pharmacopoeias has from\r\ntime to time been reduced so much, that, if we had confined ourselves to\r\nthat alone, we fear our little treatise on this head would, by many\r\npersons, be thought defective. The following list is therefore given, as\r\ncontaining what are used, though probably not so much by practitioners\r\nin medicine, as by our good housewives in the country, who, without\r\ndisparagement to medical science, often relieve the distresses of their\r\nfamilies and neighbours by the judicious application of drugs of this\r\nnature, and many of which are also sold for the same purposes in the\r\nLondon herb-shops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n291. ACANTHUS mollis. SMOOTH BEARS-BREECH. The Leaves.--Are of a soft\r\nsweetish taste, and abound with a mucilaginous juice: its virtues do not\r\nseem to differ from those of Althea and other mucilaginous plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n292. ACHILLA Ptarmica. SNEEZEWORT. The Root.--The roots have and acrid\r\nsmell, and a hot biting taste: chewed, they occasion a plentiful\r\ndischarge of saliva; and when powdered and snuffed up the nose, provoke\r\nsneezing. These are sold at the herb-shops as a substitute for pellitory\r\nof Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n293. ACHILLEA Ageratum. MAUDLIN. The Leaves and Flowers.--This has a\r\nlight agreeable smell; and a roughish, somewhat warm and bitterish\r\ntaste. These qualities point out its use as a mild corroborant; but it\r\nhas long been a stranger in practice, and is now omitted both by the\r\nLondon and Edinburgh Colleges. It is however in use by the common\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n294. ACHILLEA Millefolium. YARROW. The Leaves.--The leaves have a rough\r\nbitterish taste, and a faint aromatic smell. Their virtues are those of\r\na very mild astringent, and as such they stand recommended in\r\nhaemorrhages both internal and external, diarrhoeas, debility and laxity\r\nof the fibres; and likewise in spasmodic hysterical affections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n295. AJUGA reptans. BUGLE. The Leaves.--These have at first a sweetish\r\ntaste, which gradually becomes bitterish and roughish. They are\r\nrecommended as vulnerary medicines, and in all cases where mild\r\nastringents or corroborants are proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n296. ALCHEMILLA vulgaris. LADY'S MANTLE. The Leaves.--These discover to\r\nthe taste a moderate astringency, and were formerly much esteemed in\r\nsome female weaknesses, and in fluxes of the belly. They are now rarely\r\nmade use of; though both the fresh leaves and roots might doubtless be\r\nof service in cases where mild astringents are required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n297. AMMI majus. BISHOPS-WEED. The Seeds.--The seeds of common\r\nbishops-weed are large and pale-coloured: their smell and taste are\r\nweak, and without any thing of the origanum flavour of the true ammi,\r\nwhich does not grow in this country. They are ranked among the four\r\nlesser hot seeds, but are scarcely otherwise made use of than as an\r\ningredient in the theriaca.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n298. AMYGDALUS Persica. ALMONDS. Flowers.--They have a cathartic effect,\r\nand especially to children have been successfully given in the character\r\nof a vermifuge for this purpose; an infusion of a dram of the flowers\r\ndried, or half an ounce in their recent state, is the requisite dose.\r\nThe expressed oil of almonds has been for a long time, and is at\r\npresent, in use for many purposes in medicine. The concentrated acid of\r\nthe bitter almond is a most dangerous poison to man and all other\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n299. ANAGALLIS arvensis. PIMPERNEL. The Leaves.--Many extraordinary\r\nvirtues have been attributed to them. Geoffroy esteems them cephalic,\r\nsudorific, vulnerary, anti-maniacal, anti-epileptic, and alexiteral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n300. ANCHUSA angustifolia. BUGLOSS. The Roots, Leaves, and Flowers.--\r\nBugloss has a slimy sweetish taste, accompanied with a kind of coolness:\r\nthe roots are the most glutinous, and the flowers the least so. These\r\nqualities point out its use in hot bilious or inflammatory distempers,\r\nand a thin acrimonious state of the fluids. The flowers are one of the\r\nfour called cordial flowers: the only quality they have that can entitle\r\nthem to this appellation, is, that they moderately cool and soften,\r\nwithout offending the palate or stomach; and thus in warm climates, or\r\nin hot diseases, may in some measure refresh the patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n301. ANEMONE Hepatica. HEPATICA. The Leaves.--It is a cooling gently\r\nrestringent herb; and hence recommended in a lax state of the fibres as\r\na corroborant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n302. ANTIRRHINIUM Elatine. FLUELLIN. The Root, Bark, and Leaves.--They\r\nwere formerly accounted excellent vulneraries, and of great use for\r\ncleansing and healing old ulcers and cancerous sores: some have\r\nrecommended them internally in leprous and scrophulous disorders; as\r\nalso in hydropic cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n303. ANTIRRHINIUM Linaria. TOAD FLAX. The Flowers.--An infusion of them\r\nis said to be very efficacious in cutaneous disorders; and Hammerin\r\ngives an instance in which these flowers, with those of verbascum, used\r\nas tea, cured an exanthematous disorder, which had resisted various\r\nother remedies tried during the course of three years.--Woodville's Med.\r\nBot. p. 372.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n304. AQUILEGIA vulgaris. COLUMBINE. The Leaves, Flowers, and Seeds.--It\r\nhas been looked upon as aperient; and was formerly in great esteem among\r\nthe common people for throwing out the small-pox and measles. A\r\ndistilled water, medicated vinegar, and conserve, were prepared from the\r\nflowers; but they have long given place to medicines of greater\r\nefficacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n305. ARISTOLOCHIA longa. LONG BIRTHWORT. The Roots.--This is a tuberous\r\nroot, sometimes about the size of the finger, sometimes as thick as a\r\nman's arm: great virtues used to be ascribed to this plant as a specific\r\nin most uterine obstructions and gout: the outside is of a brownish\r\ncolour; the inside yellowish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n306. ARTEMISIA vulgaris. MUGWORT. The leaves.--These have a light\r\naromatic smell, and an herbaceous bitterish taste. They are principally\r\ncelebrated as uterine and anti-hysteric: an infusion of them is\r\nsometimes drunk, either alone or in conjunction with other substances,\r\nin suppressions of immoderate fluxes. This medicine is certainly a very\r\nmild one, and considerably less hot than most others to which these\r\nvirtues are attributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n307. ASCLEPIAS Vincetoxium. SWALLOW WORT. The Root.--This root is\r\nesteemed sudorific, diuretic, and emmenagogue, and frequently employed\r\nby the French and German physicians as an alexipharmic, sometimes as a\r\nsuccedaneum to contrayerva; whence it has received the name of\r\nContrayerva Germanorum. Among us it is rarely made use of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n308. ASPERULA odorata. SWEET WOODROOF. The Flowers.--It has an\r\nexceedingly pleasant smell, which is improved by moderate exsiccation;\r\nthe taste is sub-saline, and somewhat austere. It imparts its flavour to\r\nvinous liquors. Asperula is supposed to attenuate viscid humours, and\r\nstrengthen the tone of the bowels: it was recommended in obstructions of\r\nthe liver and biliary ducts, and by some in epilepsies and palsies:\r\nmodern practice has nevertheless rejected it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n309. ASPLENIUM Ceterach. SPLEENWORT.--It is recommended as a pectoral,\r\nand for promoting urine in nephritic cases. The virtue which it has been\r\nmost celebrated for, is that which it has the least title to, i. e.\r\ndiminish the spleen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n310. ASPLENIUM Scolophendrium. HARTS-TONGUE. The Leaves.--These have a\r\nroughish, somewhat mucilaginous taste. They are recommended in\r\nobstructions of the viscera, and for strengthening their tone; and have\r\nsometimes been made use of for these intentions, either alone, or in\r\nconjunction with maiden-hair, or the other plants of similar properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n311. ATROPA Mandragora. MANDRAKE. The Leaves.--The qualities of this\r\nplant are very doubtful: it has a strong disagreeable smell resembling\r\nthat of the narcotic herbs, to which class it is usually referred. It\r\nhas rarely been any otherwise made use of in medicine, than as an\r\ningredient in one of the old officinal unguents. Both that composition\r\nand the plant itself are rejected from our Pharmacopoeias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n312. BALLOTA nigra. BASE HOREHOUND. The Leaves.--These are doubtless an\r\nuseful aperient and deobstruent; promote the fluid secretions in\r\ngeneral, and liberally taken loosen the belly. They are an ingredient\r\nonly in the theriaca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n313. BELLIS perennis. DAISIES. The Leaves.--They have a subtile subacrid\r\ntaste, and are recommended as vulneraries, and in asthmas and hectic\r\nfevers, and such disorders as are occasioned by drinking cold liquors\r\nwhen the body has been much heated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n214. BERBERIS vulgaris. BERBERRY. The Bark and Fruit.--The outward bark\r\nof the branches and the leaves have an astringent acid taste; the inner\r\nyellow bark, a bitter one: this last is said to be serviceable in the\r\njaundice; and by some, to be an useful purgative.\r\n\r\nThe berries, which to the taste are gratefully acid, and moderately\r\nrestringent, have been given with good success in bilious fluxes, and\r\ndiseases proceeding from heat, acrimony, or thinness of the juices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n315. BETONICA officinalis. WOOD BETONY. The Leaves.--These and the\r\nflowers have an herbaceous, roughish, somewhat bitterish taste,\r\naccompanied with a very weak aromatic flavour. This herb has long been a\r\nfavourite among writers on the Materia Medica, who have not been wanting\r\nto attribute to it abundance of good qualities. Experience does not\r\ndiscover any other virtue in betony than that of a mild corroborant: as\r\nsuch, an infusion or light decoction of it may be drunk as tea, or a\r\nsaturated tincture in rectified spirit given in suitable doses, in\r\nlaxity and debility of the viscera, and disorders proceeding from\r\nthence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n316. BETULA alba. BIRCH TREE. The bark and Sap.--Upon deeply wounding or\r\nboring the trunk of the tree in the beginning of spring, a sweetish\r\njuice issues forth, sometimes, as is said, in so large quantity, as to\r\nequal in weigth to the whole tree and root: one branch will bleed a\r\ngallon or more a day. This juice is chiefly recommended in scorbutic\r\ndisorders, and other foulnesses of the blood: its most sensible effect\r\nis to promote the urinary discharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n317. BORAGO officinalis. BORAGE. The Flowers.--An exhilarating virtue\r\nhas been attributed to the flowers of borage, which are hence ranked\r\namong the so called cordial flowers: but they appear to have very little\r\nclaim to any virtue of this kind, and seem to be altogether\r\ninsignificant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n318. BRYONIA alba. WHITE BRYONY. The Roots.--This is a strong irritating\r\ncathartic; and as such has sometimes been successfully exhibited in\r\nmaniacal cases, in some kinds of dropsies, and in several chronical\r\ndisorders, where a quick solution of viscid juices, and a sudden\r\nstimulus on the solids, were required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n319. CALENDULA officinalis. MARIGOLD. The Flowers.--These are supposed\r\nto be aperient and attenuating; as also cardiac, alexipharmic, and\r\nsudorific: they are principally celebrated in uterine obstructions, the\r\njaundice, and for throwing out the small-pox. Their sensible qualities\r\ngive little foundation for these virtues: they have scarcely any taste,\r\nand no considerable smell. The leaves of the plant discover a viscid\r\nsweetishness, accompanied with a more durable saponaceous pungency and\r\nwarmth: these seem capable of answering some useful purposes, as a\r\nstimulating, aperient, antiscorbutic medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n320. CANNABIS sativa. HEMP. The Seeds.--These have some smell of the\r\nherb; their taste is unctuous and sweetish; on expression they yield a\r\nconsiderable quantity of insipid oil: hence they are recommended (boiled\r\nin milk, or triturated with water into an emulsion) against coughs, heat\r\nof urine, and the like. They are also said to be useful in incontinence\r\nof urine; but experience does not warrant their having any virtues of\r\nthis kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n321. CARTHAMUS tinctorius. SAFFLOWER. The Seeds.--These have been\r\ncelebrated as a cathartic: they operate very slowly, and for the most\r\npart disorder the bowels, especially when given in substance; triturated\r\nwith aromatic distilled waters, they form an emulsion less offensive,\r\nyet inferior in efficacy to more common purgatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n322. CENTAUREA Cyanus. BLUE-BOTTLE. The Flowers.--As to their virtues,\r\nnotwithstanding the present practice expects not any from them, they\r\nhave been formerly celebrated against the bites of poisonous animals,\r\ncontagious diseases, palpitations of the heart, and many other\r\ndistempers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n323. CENTAUREA rhapontica. GREATER CENTAURY. The Root.--It has a rough\r\nsomewhat acrid taste, and abounds with a red viscid juice; its rough\r\ntaste has gained it some esteem as an astringent; its acrimony as an\r\naperient; and its glutinous quality as a vulnerary: the present practice\r\ntakes little notice of it in any intention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n324. CHELIDONIUM majus. GREAT CELANDINE. The Leaves and Juice.--This is\r\nan excellent medicine in the jaundice; it is also good against all\r\nobstructions of the viscera, and, if continued a time, will do great\r\nservice against the scurvy. The juice also is used successfully for sore\r\neyes, removing warts, &c. It should be used fresh, for it loses the\r\ngreatest part of its virtue in drying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n325. CHENOPODIUM olidum. STINKING GOOSEFOOT. The Leaves.--Its smell has\r\ngained it the character of an excellent anti-hysteric; and this is the\r\nonly use it is applied to. Tournefort recommends a spiritous tincture,\r\nothers a decoction in water, and others a conserve of the leaves, as of\r\nwonderful efficacy in uterine disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n326. CHRYSANTHEMUM Leucanthemum. OX-EYE DAISY. The Leaves.--Geoffroy\r\nrelates that the herb, gathered before the flowers have come forth, and\r\nboiled in water, imparts an acrid taste, penetrating and subtile like\r\npepper; and that this decoction is an excellent vulnerary and diuretic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n327. CISTUS ladanifetus. GUM CISTUS.--The gum labdanum is procured from\r\nthis shrub, and is its only produce used in medicine. This is an\r\nexudation from the leaves and twigs in the manner of manna, more than of\r\nany thing else. They get it off by drawing a parcel of leather thongs\r\nover the shrubs. It is not much used, but it is a good cephalic.--Hill's\r\nHerbal, p. 72.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n328. CLEMATIS recta. UPRIGHT VIRGIN'S BOWER.--The whole plant is\r\nextremely acrid. It was useful for Dr. Stoerck to employ the leaves and\r\nflowers in ulcers and cancers, as well as an extract prepared from the\r\nformer; yet the preparation which he chiefly recommended was an infusion\r\nof two or three drams of the leaves in a pint of boiling water, of which\r\nhe gave four ounces three times a-day, while the powdered leaves were\r\napplied as an escharotic to the ulcers.--Wood-ville's Med. Bot. p. 481.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n329. COCHLEARIA Coronopus. SWINES-CRESS.--This is an excellent diuretic,\r\nsafe and yet very powerful. The juice may be taken; and it is good for\r\nthe jaundice, and against all inward obstructions, and against the\r\nscurvy: the leaves may also be eaten as sallet, or dried and given in\r\ndecoction.--Hill's Hebal, p. 105.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n330. CONVALLARIA Polygonatum. SOLOMON'S SEAL. The Root.--The root has\r\nseveral joints, with some flat circular depressions, supposed to\r\nresemble the stamp of a seal. It has a sweetish mucilaginous taste. As\r\nto its virtues, practitioners do not now expect any considerable ones\r\nfrom it, and pay very little regard to the vulnerary qualities which it\r\nwas formerly celebrated for. It is used by pugilists to remove the black\r\nappearance occasioned from extravasated blood, and for curing bruises on\r\nthe face, particularly black-eyes obtained by boxing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n331. CONVALLARIA majalis. MAY LILY. The Roots and Flowers.--The roots of\r\nthis abound with a soft mucilage, and hence they have been used\r\nexternally in emollient and maturating cataplasms: they were an\r\ningredient in the suppurating cataplasm of the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia.\r\nThose of the wild plant are very bitter: dried, they are said to prove a\r\ngentle errhine; as also are the flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n332. CONVOLVULUS sepium. BIND-WEED.--The poor people use the root of\r\nthis plant fresh gathered and boiled in ale as a cathartic; and it is\r\nfound generally to answer that purpose. It would, however, nauseate a\r\ndelicate stomach; but for people of strong constitutions there is not a\r\nbetter medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n333. CUSCUTA europaea. DODDER. The whole plant gathered green is to be\r\nboiled in water with a little ginger and allspice, and this decoction\r\noperates as a cathartic; it also opens obstructions of the liver, and is\r\ngood in the jaundice and many other disorders arising from the like\r\ncause.--Hill's Herbal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n334. CYNOGLOSSUM officinale. HOUNDS-TONGUE. The Root.--The virtues of\r\nthis root are very doubtful: it is generally supposed to be narcotic,\r\nand by some to be virulently so: others declare that it has no virtue of\r\nthis kind, and look upon it as a mere glutinous astringent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n335. CYPERUS longus. LONG CYPERUS. The Root.--This is long, slender,\r\ncrooked, and full of knots: outwardly of a dark-brown or blackish\r\ncolour, inwardly whitish; of an aromatic smell, and an agreeable warm\r\ntaste: both the taste and smell are improved by moderate exsiccation.\r\nCyperus is accounted a good stomachic and carminative, but is at present\r\nvery little regarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n336. DICTAMNUS albus. WHITE or BASTARD DITTANY. The Root.--The cortical\r\npart of the root, dried and rolled up into quills, is sometimes brought\r\nto us. This is of a white colour, a weak, not very agreeable smell; and\r\na durable bitter, lightly pungent taste. It is recommended as an\r\nalexipharmic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n337. EQUISETUM palustre. HORSE-TAIL. The Herb.--It is said to be a very\r\nstrong astringent: it has indeed a manifest astringency, but in a very\r\nlow degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n338. ERYSIMUM officinale.--It is said to be attenuant, expectorant, and\r\ndiuretic; and has been strongly recommended in chronical coughs and\r\nhoarseness. Rondeletius informs us that the last-mentioned complaint,\r\noccasioned by loud speaking, was cured by this plant in three days.\r\nOther testimonies of its good effects in this disorder are recorded by\r\nwriters on the Materia Medica, of whom we may mention Dr. Cullen; who\r\nfor this purpose recommends the juice of the Erysimum to be mixed with\r\nan euqal quantity of honey and sugar; in this way also it is said to be\r\nan useful remedy in ulcerations of the mouth and throat.--Woodville's\r\nMed. Bot. p. 407.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n339. ERYSIMUM Alliaria. SAUCE ALONE.--The leaves of this plant are very\r\nacrimonious, and have a strong flavour of onions. It is considered as a\r\npowerful diaphoretic, diuretic, and antiscorbutic.--Woodville's Med.\r\nBot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n340. EUPATORIUM cannabinum. HEMP AGRIMONY, &c. Leaves.--They are greatly\r\nrecommended for strengthening the tone of the viscera, and as an\r\naperient; and said to have excellent effects in the dropsy, jaundice,\r\ncachexies, and scorbutic disorders. Boerhaave informs us, that this is\r\nthe common medicine of the turf-diggers in Holland, against scurvies,\r\nfoul ulcers, and swellings in the feet, which they are subject to. The\r\nroof of this plant is said to operate as a strong cathartic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n341. EUPHORBIA Esula. SPURGE FLAX. Its Berries.--These are useful in\r\nremoving warts and excrescences, if bruised and laid thereon. They are\r\nso acrid in their nature as to be altogether unfit for internal use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n342. EUPHRASIA officinalis. EYEBRIGHT. Leaves.--It was formerly\r\ncelebrated as an ophtalmic, both taken internally and applied\r\nexternally. Hildanus says he has known old men of seventy, who had lost\r\ntheir sight, recover it again by the use of this herb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n343. FRAGARIA vesca. THE STRAWBERRY. The Leaves and Fruit.--They are\r\nsomewhat styptic, and bitterish; and hence my be of some service in\r\ndebility and laxity of the viscera, and immoderate secretions, or a\r\nsuppression of the natural evacuations depending thereon: they are\r\nrecommended in haemorrhages and fluxes; and likewise as aperients, in\r\nsuppressions of urine, obstructions of the viscera, in the jaundice, &c.\r\nThe fruit is in general very grateful both to the palate and stomach:\r\nlike other fruits of the dulco-acid kind, they abate heat, quench\r\nthirst, loosen the belly, and promote urine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n344. FUMARIA officinalis. FUMITORY. The Leaves.--The medical effects of\r\nthis herb are, to strengthen the tone of the bowels, gently loosen the\r\nbelly, and promote the urinary and other natural secretions. It is\r\nprincipally recommended in melancholic, scorbutic, and cutaneous\r\ndisorders; for opening obstructions of the viscera, attenuating and\r\npromoting the evacuations of viscid juices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n345. GALEGA officinalis. GOAT'S RUE. The Herb.--This is celebrated as an\r\nalexipharmic; but its sensible qualities discover no foundation for any\r\nvirtues of this kind: the taste is merely leguminous; and in Italy\r\n(where it grows wild) it is said to be used as food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n346. GALIUM Aparine. GOOSEGRASS, OR CLEAVERS. The Leaves.--It is\r\nrecommended as an aperient, and in chronic eruptions; but practice has\r\nlittle regard to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n347. GALIUM verum. LADIES BEDSTRAW, OR CHEESE-RENNET. The Herb.--This\r\nherb has a subacid taste, with a very faint, not disagreeable smell: the\r\njuice changes blue vegetable infusions to a red colour, and coagulates\r\nmilk, thus exhibiting marks of acidity. It stands recommended as a mild\r\nstyptic, and in epilepsy; but has never been much in use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n348. GERANIUM robertianum. HERB ROBERT. The leaves.--They have an\r\naustere taste, and have hence been recommended as astringent: but they\r\nhave long been disregarded in practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n349. GLECHOMA hederacea. GROUND-IVY. The Leaves.--This herb is an useful\r\ncorroborant, aperient, and detergent; and hence stands recommended\r\nagainst laxity, debility, and obstructions of the viscera: some have had\r\na great opinion of it for cleansing and healing ulcers of the internal\r\nparts, even of the lungs; and for purifying the blood. It is customary\r\nto infuse the dried leaves in malt liquors, to which it readily imparts\r\nits virtues; a practice not to be commended, unless it is for the\r\npurpose of medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n350. HEDERA helix. IVY. The Leaves and Berries.--The leaves have very\r\nrarely been given internally; notwithstanding they are recommended (in\r\nthe Ephem. natur. curios. vol. ii. obs. 120.) against the atrophy of\r\nchildren; their taste is nauseous, acrid, and bitter. Externally they\r\nhave sometimes been employed for drying and healing ichorous sores, and\r\nlikewise for keeping issues open. The berries were supposed by the\r\nancients to have a purgative and emetic quality; later writers have\r\nrecommended them in small doses, as diaphoretics and alexipharmics; and\r\nMr. Boyle tells us, that in the London plague the powder of them was\r\ngiven with vinegar, with good success, as a sudorific. It is probable\r\nthe virtue of the composition was rather owing to the vinegar than to\r\nthe powder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n351. HERNIARIA glabra. RUPTUREWORT. The Leaves.--It is a very mild\r\nrestringent, and may, in some degree, be serviceable in disorders\r\nproceeding from a weak flaccid state of the viscera: the virtue which it\r\nhas been most celebrated for, it has little title to, that of curing\r\nhernias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n352. HYPERICUM perforatum. ST. JOHN'S WORT. The Leaves and Flowers.--Its\r\ntaste is rough and bitterish; the smell disagreeable. Hypericum has long\r\nbeen celebrated as a corroborant, diuretic, and vulnerary; but more\r\nparticularly in hysterical and maniacal disorders: it has been reckoned\r\nof such efficacy in these last, as to have thence received the name of\r\nfuga daemonum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n353. JASMINUM officinale. JASMINE. The Flowers.--The flowers have a\r\nstrong smell, which is liked by most people, though to some\r\ndisagreeable: expressed oils extract their fragrance by infusion; and\r\nwater elevates somewhat of it in distillation, but scarcely any\r\nessential oil can be obtained from them: the distilled water, kept for a\r\nlittle time, loses its odour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n354. IRIS Pseudoacorus. FLOWER-DE-LUCE. The Root.--The roots, when\r\nrecent, have a bitter, acrid, nauseous taste, and taken into the stomach\r\nprove strongly cathartic; and hence the juice is recommended in\r\ndropsies, in the dose of three or four scruples. By drying they lose\r\nthis quality, yet still retain a somewhat pungent, bitterish taste:\r\ntheir smell in this state is of the aromatic kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n355. IRIS florentina. FLORENTINE IRIS, OR ORRIS-ROOT.--The roots grown\r\nin this country have neither the odour nor the other qualities that\r\nthose possess which are grown in warmer climates: so that, for the\r\npurposes of medicine, they are usually imported from Leghorn.\r\n\r\nThe root in its recent state is extremely acrid, and, when chewed,\r\nexcites a pungent heat in the mouth which continues several hours; but\r\non being dried, this acrimony is almost wholly dissipated, the taste\r\nbecomes slightly bitter, and the smell approaching to that of violets.\r\nIt is now chiefly used in its dried state, and ranked as a pectoral or\r\nexpectorant. The principal use of the roots is, however, for the\r\npurposes of perfumery, for which it is in considerable demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n356. LACTUCA sativa. GARDEN LETTUCE. The Leaves and Seeds.--It smells\r\nstrongly of opium, and resembles it in its effects; and its narcotic\r\npower, like that of the poppy heads, resides in its milky juice. An\r\nextract from the expressed juice is recommended in small doses in\r\ndropsy. In those diseases of long standing proceeding from visceral\r\nobstructions, it has been given to the extent of half an ounce a-day. It\r\nis said to agree with the stomach, to quench thirst, to be greatly\r\nlaxative, powerfully diuretic, and somewhat diaphoretic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n357. LAMIUM album. WHITE ARCHANGEL, OR DEAD NETTLE. The Flowers.--The\r\nflowers have been particularly celebrated in female weaknesses, as also\r\nin disorders of the lungs; but they appear to be of very weak powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n358. LAVENDULA Stoechas. ARABIAN STOECHAS, OR FRENCH LAVEN-DER. The\r\nFlowers.--They have a very fragrant smell, and a warm, aromatic,\r\nbitterish, subacrid taste: distilled with water, they yield a\r\nconsiderable quantity of a fragrant essential oil; to rectified spirit\r\nit imparts a strong tincture, which inspissated proves an elegant\r\naromatic extract, but is seldom used in medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n359. LEONURUS Cardiaca. MOTHERWORT. The Leaves.--These have a bitter\r\ntaste, and a pretty strong smell: they are supposed to be useful in\r\nhysteric disorders, to strengthen the stomach, to promote urine; and\r\nindeed it may be judged from their smell and taste, that their medical\r\nvirtues are considerable, though they are now rejected both from the\r\nLondon and Edinburgh Pharmacopoeias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n360. LILIUM candidum. WHITE LILY. The Roots.--These are used in\r\npoultices. The good housewife doctors cut the roots in slices and steep\r\nthem in brandy; and they are said to be an excellent remedy for all\r\nbruises and green wounds: for which purposes it is applied by them with\r\nconsiderable effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n361. LITHOSPERMUM officinale. GROMWELL. The Seeds.--These are roundish,\r\nhard, and of a whitish colour, like little pearls. Powdered, they have\r\nbeen supposed peculiarly serviceable in calculous disorders. Their taste\r\nis merely farinaceous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n362. LYSIMACHIA Nummularia. MONEYWORT, OR HERB TWOPENCE. The Leaves.--\r\nTheir taste is subastringent, and very slightly acid: hence they stand\r\nrecommended by Boerhaave in the hot scurvy, and in uterine and other\r\nhaemorrhagies. But their effects are so inconsiderable, that common\r\npractice takes no notice of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n363. MALVA alcea. VERVAIN-MALLOW. The Leaves.--Alcea agrees in quality\r\nwith the Althaea and Malva vulgaris; but appears to be less mucilaginous\r\nthan either.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n364. MATRICARIA Parthenium. COMMON WILD FEVERFEW. The Leaves and\r\nFlowers.--Simon Pauli relates, that he has experienced most happy\r\neffects from it in obstructions of the uterine evacuations. I have often\r\nseen, says he, from the use of a decoction of Matricaria and chamomile\r\nflowers with a little mugwort, hysteric complaints instantly relieved,\r\nand the patient from a lethargic state, returned as it were into life\r\nagain. Matricaria is likewise recommended in sundry other disorders, as\r\na warm stimulating bitter: all that bitters and carminatives can do,\r\nsays Geoffroy, may be expected from this. It is undoubtedly a medicine\r\nof some use in these cases, though not perhaps equal to chamomile\r\nflowers alone, with which the Matricaria agrees in sensible qualities,\r\nexcept in being weaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n365. NEPETA Calamintha. FIELD CALAMINT. The Leaves.--This is a low\r\nplant, growing wild about hedges and highways, and in dry sandy soils.\r\nThe leaves have a quick warm taste, and smell strongly of pennyroyal: as\r\nmedicines, they differ little otherwise from spearmint, than in being\r\nsomewhat hotter, and of a less pleasant odour; which last circumstance\r\nhas procured calamint the preference in hysteric cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n366. NEPETA cataria. NEP, OR CATMINT. The Leaves.--This is a moderately\r\naromatic plant, of a strong smell, not ill resembling a mixture of mint\r\nand pennyroyal; it is also recommended in hysteric cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n367. NIGELLA romana. FENNEL-FLOWER. The Seeds.--They have a strong, not\r\nunpleasant smell; and a subacrid, somewhat unctuous disagreeable taste.\r\nThey stand recommended as aperient, diuretic, &c. but being suspected to\r\nhave noxious qualities should be used with caution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n368. NYMPHAEA alba. WHITE WATER-LILY. The Root and Flowers.--These have a\r\nrough, bitterish, glutinous taste, (the flowers are the least rough,)\r\nand when fresh a disagreeable smell, which is in great measure lost by\r\ndrying: they are recommended in alvine fluxes, gleets, and the like. The\r\nroots are supposed by some to be in an eminent degree narcotic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n369. OCYMUM Basilicum. BASIL. The Leaves.--These have a soft, somewhat\r\nwarm taste; and when rubbed, a strong unpleasant smell, which by\r\nmoderate drying becomes more agreeable. They are said to attenuate\r\nviscid phlegm, promote expectoration, and the uterine secretions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n370. OPHIOGLOSSUM vulgatum. ADDERS-TONGUE. The Leaf.--An ointment is\r\nmade of the fresh leaves, and it is a good application to green wounds.\r\nIt is a very antient application, although now discarded from the\r\napothecary's shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n371. PAEONIA corolloides. MALE PEONY. The Seeds.--These are strong, and\r\nworn round the neck to assist detention, and are probably as good as\r\nother celebrated anodyne beads which have been so long recommended for\r\nthe same purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n372. PHELLANDRIUM aquaticum. WATER HEMLOCK.--The seeds of this plant,\r\naccording to Dr. Lange, when taken in large doses, produce a remarkable\r\nsensation of weight in the head, accompanied with giddiness,\r\nintoxication, &c. It may probably prove, however, an active medicine,\r\nespecially in wounds and inveterate ulcers of different kinds, and even\r\nin cancers; also in phthisis pulmonalis, asthma, dyspepsia, intermittent\r\nfevers, &c. About two scruples of the seed, two or three times a-day,\r\nwas the ordinary dose given. Medicines of this kind should be used with\r\ngreat caution.--Woodville's Med. Bot. p. 91, 92.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n373. PIMPINELLA saxifraga. BURNET SAXIFRAGE. The Root, Leaves, and\r\nSeeds.--This root promises from its sensible qualities, to be a medicine\r\nof considerable utility, though little regarded in common pratice.\r\nStahl, Hoffman, and other German physicians, are extremely fond of it,\r\nand recommend it as an excellent stomachic, resolvent, detergent,\r\ndiuretic, diaphoretic, and alexipharmic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n374. PLANTAGO major. COMMON BROAD-LEAVED PLANTAIN.--The leaves are\r\nslightly astringent, and the seeds said to be so; and hence they stand\r\nrecommended in haemorrhages, and other cases where medicines of this kind\r\nare proper. The leaves bruised a little, are the usual application of\r\nthe common people to slight flesh wounds. The Edinburgh College used to\r\ndirect an extract to be made from the leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n375. POTENTILLA anserina. SILVERWEED. The Leaves.--The sensible\r\nqualities of Anserina promise no great virtue of any kind, for to the\r\ntaste it discovers only a slight roughness, from whence it was thought\r\nto be entitled to a place among the milder corroborants. As the\r\nastringency of Tormentil is confined chiefly to its root, it might be\r\nthought that the same circumstance would take place in this plant; but\r\nthe root is found to have no other than a pleasant sweetish taste, like\r\nthat of parsnip, but not so strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n376. POTENTILLA reptans. CINQUEFOIL, OR FIVE-LEAVED GRASS. Root.--The\r\nroot is moderately astringent: and as such is sometimes given internally\r\nagainst diarrhoeas and other fluxes; and employed in gargarisms for\r\nstrengthening the gums, &c. The cortical part of the root may be taken,\r\nin substance, to the quantity of a dram: the internal part is\r\nconsiderably weaker, and requires to be given in double the dose to\r\nproduce the same effect. It is scarcely otherwise made use of than as an\r\ningredient in Venice treacle.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n377. POPULUS niger. THE BLACK POPLAR. Its Buds.--The young buds or\r\nrudiments of the leaves, which appear in the beginning of spring, abound\r\nwith a yellow, unctuous odorous juice. They have hitherto been employed\r\nchiefly in an ointment, which received its name from them; though they\r\nare certainly capable of being applied to other purposes: a tincture of\r\nthem made in rectified spirit, yields upon being isnpissated, a fragrant\r\nresin superior to many of those brought from abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n378. PRIMULA officinalis. COWSLIP. The Flowers.--The flowers appear in\r\nApril; they have a pleasant sweet smell, and a subacrid, bitterish,\r\nsubastringent taste. An infusion of them, used as tea, is recommended as\r\na mild corroborant in nervous complaints. A strong infusion of them,\r\nwith a proper quantity of sugar, forms an agreeable syrup, which for a\r\nlong time maintained a place in the shops. By boiling, even for a little\r\ntime, their fine flavour is destroyed. A wine is also made of the\r\nflowers, which is given as an opiate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n379. PRUNELLA vulgaris. SELFHEAL. The Leaves.--It has an herbaceous\r\nroughish taste, and hence stands recommended in haemorrhages and alvine\r\nfluxes. It has been principally celebrated as a vulnerary, whence its\r\nname; and in gargarisms for aphthae and inflammations of the fauces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n380. PULMONARIA officinalis. SPOTTED LUNGWORT. The Leaves.--They stand\r\nrecommended against ulcers of the lungs, phthisis, and other like\r\ndisorders.--Lewis's Mat. Med.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n381. RANUNCULUS Ficaria. PILEWORT. The Leaves and Root.--The roots\r\nconsist of slender fibres, with some little tubercles among them. These,\r\nwith the leaves, are considered of considerable eficacy in the cure of\r\nhaemorrhoids; for which purpose, considerable quantities are sold at\r\nherb-shops in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n382. RANUNCULUS Flammula. SMALL SPEARWORT.--It has been lately\r\ndiscovered that this plant possesses very active powers as an emetic,\r\nand it is supposed to be useful in some cases of vegetable poisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n383. RHAMNUS Frangula. THE BLACK OR BERRY-BEARING ALDER. Its Bark.--The\r\ninternal bark of the trunk or root of the tree, given to the quantity of\r\na dram, purges violently, occasioning gripes, nausea, and vomiting.\r\nThese may be in good measure prevented by the addition of aromatics; but\r\nwe have plenty of safer and less precarious purgatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n384. RHUS coriaria. ELM-LEAVED SUMACH.--Both the leaves and berries have\r\nbeen employed in medicine; but the former are more astringent and tonic,\r\nand have been long in common use, though at present discarded from the\r\nPharmacopoeias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n385. RIBES nigrum.--The juice of black currants boiled up with sugar to\r\na jelly, is an excellent remedy against sore throats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n386. RUMEX Hydrolapathum. THE GREAT WATER DOCK.--The leaves of the docks\r\ngently loosen the belly, and have sometimes been made ingredients in\r\ndecoctions for removing a costive habit. The roots, in conjunction with\r\nother medicines, are celebrated for the cure of scorbutic and cutaneous\r\ndisorders, for which the following receipt is given by Lewis.\r\n\r\nSix ounces of the roots of the water dock, with two of saffron; and of\r\nmace, cinnamon, gentian root, liquorice root, and black pepper, each\r\nthree ounces, (or, where the pepper is improper, six ounces of\r\nliquorice,) are to be reduced into coarse powder, and put into a mixture\r\nof two gallons of wine, with half a gallon of strong vinegar, and the\r\nyolks of three egs; and the whole digested, with a moderate warmth, for\r\nthree days, in a glazed vessel close stopped: from three to six ounces\r\nof this liquor are to be taken every morning on an empty stomach, for\r\nfourteen or twenty days, or longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n387. SALVIA Sclarea. GARDEN CLARY. The Leaves and Seeds.--These have a\r\nwarm, bitterish, pungent taste; and a strong, not very agreeable smell:\r\nthe touch discovers in the leaves a large quantity of glutinous or\r\nresinous matter. They are principally recommended in female weaknesses,\r\nin hysteric disorders, and in flatulent colics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n388. SAMBUCUS Ebulus. DWARF ELDER, OR DANEWORT. The Root, Bark, and\r\nLeaves.--These have a nauseous, sharp, bitter taste, and a kind of acrid\r\nungrateful smell: they are all strong cathartics, and as such are\r\nrecommended in dropsies, and other cases where medicines of that kind\r\nare indicated. The bark of the root is said to be strongest: the leaves\r\nthe weakest. But they are all too churlish medicines for general use:\r\nthey sometimes evacuate violently upwards, almost always nauseate the\r\nstomach, and occasion great uneasiness of the bowels. By boiling they\r\nbecome (like the other drastics) milder, and more safe in operation.\r\nFernelius relates, that by long coction they entirely lose their\r\npurgative virtue. The berries of this plant are likewise purgative, but\r\nless virulent than the other parts. A rob prepared from them may be\r\ngiven to the quantity of an ounce, as a cathartic; and in smaller ones\r\nas an aperient and deobstruent in chronic disorders: in this last\r\nintention, it is said by Haller to be frequently used in Switzerland, in\r\nthe dose of a dram.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n389. SANICULA officinalis. SANICLE. The Leaves.--These have an\r\nherbaceous, roughish taste: they have long been celebrated for sanative\r\nvirtues, both internally and externally; nevertheless their effects, in\r\nany intention, are not considerable enough to gain them a place in the\r\npresent practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n390. SAPONARIA officinalis. SOAPWORT. The Herb and Root.--The roots\r\ntaste sweetish and somewhat pungent; and have a light smell like those\r\nof liquorice: digested in rectified spirit they yield a strong tincture,\r\nwhich loses nothing of its taste or flavour in being inspissated to the\r\nconsistence of an extract. This elegant root has not come much into\r\npractice among us, though it promises, from its sensible qualities, to\r\nbe a medicine of considerable utility: it is greatly esteemed by the\r\nGerman physicians as an aperient, corroborant, and sudorific; and\r\npreferred by the College of Wirtemberg, by Stahl, Neumann, and others,\r\nto sarsaparilla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n391. SAXIFRAGA granulata.--Linnaeus describes the taste of this plant to\r\nbe acrid and pungent, which we have not been able to discover. Neither\r\nthe tubercles of this root, nor the leaves, manifest to the organs of\r\ntaste any quality likely to be of medicinal use; and therefore, though\r\nthis species of Saxifraga has been long employed as a popular remedy in\r\nnephritic and gravelly disorders, yet we do not find, either from its\r\nsensible qualities or from any published instances of its efficacy, that\r\nit deserves a place in the Materia Medica.--Woodville's Med. Bot. p.\r\n551.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n392. SCABIOSA succisa. DEVIL'S BIT. The Leaves and Roots.--These stand\r\nrecommended as alexipharmics, but they have long given place to\r\nmedicines of greater efficacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n393. SCANDIX Cerefolium. Chervil. The Leaves.--Geoffroy assures us, that\r\nhe has found it from experience to be of excellent service in dropsies:\r\nthat in this disorder it promotes the discharge of urine when\r\nsuppressed, renders it clear when feculent and turbid, and when high and\r\nfiery of a paler colour; that it acts midly without irritation, and\r\ntends rather to allay than excite inflammation. He goes so far as to\r\nsay, that dropsies which do not yield to this medicine are scarce\r\ncapable of being cured by any other. He directs the juice to be given in\r\nthe dose of three or four ounces every fourth hour, and continued for\r\nsome time, either alone, or in conjunction with nitre and syrup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n394. SEDUM Telephium. ORPINE. The Leaves.--This is a very thick-leaved\r\njuicy plant, not unlike the houseleeks. It has a mucilaginous roughish\r\ntaste, and hence is recommended as emollient and astringent, but has\r\nnever been much regarded in practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n395. SEMPERVIVUM tectorum. GREATER HOUSE-LEEK. The Leaves.--These are\r\nprincipally applied in cases of erysipelatous and other hot eruptions of\r\nthe skin, in which they are of immediate service in allaying the pain\r\narising therefrom: great quantities are cultivated in Surrey, and\r\nbrought to the London markets. It is remarkable of this plant, that its\r\njuice, when purified by filtration, appears of a dilute yellowish colour\r\nupon the admixture of an equal quantity of rectified spirit of wine; but\r\nforms a beautiful white, light coagulum, like the finer kinds of\r\npomatum: this proves extremely volatile; for when freed from the aqueous\r\nphlegm, and exposed to the air, it altogether exhales in a very little\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n396. SENECIO Jacobaea. RAGWORT. The Leaves.--Their taste is roughish,\r\nbitter, pungent, and extremely unpleasant: they stand strongly\r\nrecommended by Simon Pauli against dysenteries; but their forbidding\r\ntaste has prevented its coming into practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n397. SOLANUM nigrum. COMMON NIGHTSHADE. The Leaves and Berries.--In the\r\nyear 1757, Mr. Gataker, surgeon to the Westminster Hospital, called the\r\nattention of the Faculty to this plant, by a publication recommending\r\nits internal use in old sores, srophulous and cancerous ulcers,\r\ncutaneous eruptions, and even dropsies; all of which were much relieved\r\nor completely cured of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n398. SPIRAEA Ulmaria. MEADOW-SWEET. The Leaves and Flowers.--The flowers\r\nhave a very pleasant flavour, which water extracts from them by\r\ninfusion, and elevates in distillation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n399. SPIRAEA Filipendula. DROPWORT. The Root.--The root consists of a\r\nnumber of tubercles, fastened together by slender strings; its taste is\r\nrough and bitterish, with a slight degree of pungency. These qualities\r\npoint out its use in a flaccid state of the vessels, and a sluggishness\r\nof the juices: the natural evacuations are in some measure restrained or\r\npromoted by it, where the excess or deficiency proceeds from this cause.\r\nHence some have recommended it as an astringent in dysenteries, a\r\ndiuretic, and others as an aperient and deobstruent in scrophulous\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n400. SYMPHYTUM officinale. COMFREY. The Root.--The roots are very large,\r\nblack on the outside, white within, full of a viscid glutinous juice, of\r\nno particular taste. They agree in quality with the roots of Althaea;\r\nwith this difference, that the mucilage of it is somewhat\r\nstronger-bodied. Many ridiculous histories of the consolidating virtues\r\nof this plant are related by authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n401. TAMUS communis. BLACK BRYONY.--The root is one of the best\r\ndiuretics known in medicine. It is an excellent remedy in the gravel and\r\nall obstructions of urine, and other disorders of the like nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n402. TANACETUM vulgare. TANSY. The Leaves.--These have a bitterish warm\r\naromatic taste; and a very pleasant smell, approaching to that of mint\r\nor a mixture of mint and maudlin. Water elevates their flavour in\r\ndistillation; and rectified spirit extracts it by infusion. They have\r\nbeen recommended in hysteric cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n403. TEUCRIUM Chamaepitys. GROUND PINE. The Leaves.--These are\r\nrecommended as aperient and vulnerary, as also in gouty and rheumatic\r\npains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n404. THYMUS vulgaris. THYME. The Leaves and Flowers.--A tea made of the\r\nfresh tops of thyme is good in asthmas and diseases of the lungs. It is\r\nrecommended against nervous complaints; but for this purpose the wild\r\nthyme is preferable. There is an oil made from thyme that cures the\r\ntooth-ache, a drop or two of it being put upon lint and applied to the\r\ntooth; this is commonly called oil of origanum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n405. TRIGONELLA Foenum-graecum. FOENUGREEK. The Seeds.--They are of a\r\nyellow colour, a rhomboidal figure; have a disagreeable strong smell,\r\nand a mucilaginous taste. Their principal use is in cataplasms,\r\nfomentations, and the like, and in emollient glysters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n406. VERBASCUM Thapsus. MULLEIN. The Leaves and Flowers.--Their taste\r\ndiscovers a glutinous quality; and hence they stand recommended as an\r\nemollient, and is in some places held in great esteem in consumptions.\r\nThe flowers of mullein have an agreeable, honeylike sweetness: an\r\nextract prepared from them by rectified spirit of wine tastes extremely\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n407. VERBENA officinalis. COMMON WILD VERVAIN. The Leaves and Root.--\r\nThis is one of the medicines which we owe to the superstition of former\r\nages; the virtue it has been celebrated for is as an amulet, on which a\r\npamphlet was some years ago published. It was recommended to wear the\r\nroot by a ribband tied round the neck for the cure of the scrophula, and\r\nfor which purpose, even now, much of the root is sold in London. As the\r\nage of superstition is passing by, it will be needless to say more on\r\nthe subject at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n408. VERONICA officinalis. MALE SPEEDWELL. The Leaves.--Hoffman and Joh.\r\nFrancus have written express treatises on this plant, recommending\r\ninfusions of it, drunk in the form of tea, as very salubrious in many\r\ndisorders, particularly those of the breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObservations on the Drying and Preserving of Herbs, &c. for Medicinal\r\nPurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe student who has paid attention to the subject described in the\r\nforegoing sections, will be struck with the admirable contrivance of\r\nDivine Wisdom; that has caused such astringent substances as are\r\ncontained in the oak and Peruvian bark, to be produced from the same\r\nsoil, and in a similar way to those mucilaginous and laxative ones which\r\nwe find in the juice of the marsh-mallow, and the olive oil. It is not\r\nintended in this small elementary work to enter into any investigation\r\nof the primitive parts of the vegetable creation, or how such different\r\nparticles are secreted. It may therefore suffice, that, although the\r\nscience of vegetable physiology admits of many very beautiful and\r\ninstructing illustrations, yet they only go so far as to prove to us,\r\nthat the first and grand principle of vegetable life and existence, as\r\nwell as of the formation of all organic substances, consists in a system\r\nof attraction and combination of the different particles of nature, as\r\nthey exist and are imbibed from the soil and the surrounding atmosphere.\r\nThus, during their existence, we observe a continual series of\r\naggregation of substance; but no sooner does the principle of life\r\nbecome extinct, than the agents of decomposition are at work, dividing\r\nand selecting each different substance, and carrying it back from whence\r\nit came:--\"From dust thou comest, and to dust thou shalt return.\" This,\r\ntherefore, seems to be the sum total of existence; the explanation of\r\nwhich, with all its interesting ramifications, is more fully explained\r\nby the learned professors in what is called the science of chemistry.\r\n\r\nAs plants of all descriptions, and their several parts, form a link of\r\nthat chain by which the welfare of the universe is connected, the\r\nindustry of mankind is excited to preserve them for the different\r\npurposes to which they are applicable, in the oeconomy of human\r\nexistence, to whose use the greater part of the animal and vegetable\r\ncreation appears to be subservient. As men, then, and rational beings,\r\nit becomes our duty so to manage those things, when necessary, as to\r\ncounteract as much as possible the decomposition and corruption which\r\nare natural to all organized bodies when deprived of the living\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nWe find that some vegetables are used fresh, but the greater part are\r\npreserved in a dry state; in which, by proper management, they can be\r\nkept for a considerable time afterwards, both for our own use as well as\r\nfor that of others who reside at a distance from the place of their\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of the parts of plants for medicinal purposes, we\r\nshould always have in view the extreme volatility of many of those\r\nsubstances, and how necessary it therefore is, that the mode of\r\npreparation and drying should be done as quickly as possible, in order\r\nto counteract the effects of the air and light, which continue to\r\ndissipate, without intermission, these particles, during the whole time\r\nthat any vegetable, either fresh or dried, is left to its influence.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the nature of hops, which I shall take as an example, as\r\nbeing prepared in this way on the largest scale, we shall find they\r\nconsist of three different principles; namely, an aroma, combined with\r\nan agreeable bitter taste, and a yellow colour; all of which properties\r\nare, by the consumers and dealers therein, expected to exist in the\r\narticle after drying.\r\n\r\nThe art of drying hops, therefore, has been a subject of speculation for\r\nmany years; and although we find the kiln apparatus for preserving them\r\ndiffer in many places, from the various opinions of the projectors, yet\r\nthey are all intended for the same mode of action, i. e. the producing\r\nof a proper degree of heat, which must be regulated according to the\r\nstate of the atmosphere at the gathering season, and the consequent\r\nquantity of the watery extract that the hops contain at the time: thus\r\nit is usual to have two kilns of different temperatures at work at the\r\nsame time. It should, however, be observed, that the principal art of\r\ndrying hops is in doing it as quickly as possible, so as not to injure\r\nthem in their colour. As soon as they are dried, it is considered\r\nnecessary to put them up into close and thick bags.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed, that all vegetables contain at every period of\r\ntheir growth two distinct species of moiture: the one called by\r\nnaturalists the common juice, which is the ascending sap, and is replete\r\nwith watery particles: the other is termed the proper juice, which\r\nhaving passed up through the leaves, and being there concocted and\r\ndeprived of the watery part, contains the principle on which various\r\nproperties and virtues of the plant depend. We therefore find that the\r\noperations above described only go to this, that the watery particles in\r\nthe common juice should be evaporated, as being a part necessary to be\r\ngot rid of; and the proper juice being of a volatile nature, the less\r\ntime the plants are exposed for that purpose, the less of this precious\r\nmaterial will be lost: and as those parts are flying off continually\r\nfrom all dried vegetables, there should be one general rule made with\r\nregard to their peparation; for, if we instance mint, balm, pennyroyal,\r\n&c., the longer these are kept in the open air, the weaker are they\r\nfound to be in their several parts.\r\n\r\nFrom hence we may naturally infer, that the usual mode in which the\r\ngenerality of herbs are dried, is not so good for the purpose, as one\r\nwould be if contrived on similar principles, as, during the length of\r\ntime necessary for the purpose, a great deal of the principal parts of\r\nthe plants must of course be evaporated and lost; for little else is\r\nregarded than to dry them so as to prevent putrefaction. Although the\r\ngenerality of herbs met with are prepared as above described, yet in\r\nsuch articles as Digitalis, Hyoscyamus, Conium, Toxicodendron, &c.,\r\nwhere the quantity necessary for a dose is so small, and so much depends\r\non its action, practitioners are often obliged to prepare it themselves.\r\nI shall therefore relate the following mode as the best adapted to that\r\npurpose. The Digitalis is prepared by collecting the leaves in the\r\nsummer, and stripping them off from the foot-stalks; these should be\r\nthen carefully exposed to a slow heat, and the watery extract slowly\r\nthrown off; in which they should not be exposed to any great degree of\r\nheat, which by its action will deprive them of their fine green colour.\r\nWhen this is effected, the whole may be put in contact with a heat that\r\nwill enable the operator to reduce it to a fine powder. And in order to\r\nkeep it with its virtues perfect, it will be necessary to deprive it as\r\nmuch as possible of the influence of air and light. Hence it is\r\npreserved in close glass bottles which are coated, and also placed in a\r\ndark part of the elaboratory. Now, it is necessary that all plants\r\nintended to be used in a dried state, should be prepared and protected\r\nin a similar manner; and although it may be considered as a superfluous\r\ntrouble, so far as regards the more common kinds, particular attention\r\nshould be paid to these, when a small quantity is a dose, and an\r\nover-dose a certain poison.\r\n\r\nOther kinds of vegetables require a certain degree of fermentation, as\r\nTobacco. The prinicpal art of preserving it consists in this operation\r\nbeing duly performed; for which purpose, as soon as the leaves of the\r\nherb are fit, the foot-stalks are broken, and the leaves left on, in\r\norder for the moisture in part to be evaporated. Afterwards these are\r\ngathered and tied in handfuls, and hung up in the shade to dry; and when\r\nsufficiently divested of moisture, the bundles are collected together\r\nand laid in large boxes or tubs, in which these are fermented, and\r\nafterwards taken out again and dried; when it is found fit to pack up\r\nfor the market.\r\n\r\nThe properties of Stramonium, which has been so much recommended for\r\ncuring asthma, consist pricipally in the aroma, which is only to be\r\npreserved in a similar manner: and I have found from experience, that if\r\nthe leaves are separated from the plant in a manner similar to that of\r\ntobacco, and the rest of the plant, noth roots, stalks, and\r\nseed-vessels, be slit and sufficiently dried in the sun or in an oven,\r\nand the whole fermented together, a very different article is the\r\nproduce than what it is when dried in the usual way, and left entirely\r\nto the chance influence of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the common operation of hay-making it may also be observed, that the\r\ncontinued turning it over and admitting its parts to the action of the\r\nsun and the air, is for the purpose of getting rid of the watery\r\nparticles contained in it; and the quicker this is done, the better it\r\nis. And although this operation is so essentially necessary, yet care\r\nshould be taken at the same time, that it be not made too dry, so as to\r\nprevent a due degree of fermentation being allowed to take place in the\r\nrick. And it may be observed that the best grasses, or other plants used\r\nfor hay, if made too dry, so as to prevent the natural fermentation\r\nwhich their proper juices will excite, can never make either palatable\r\nor nutritive food for cattle. Neither can the same be effected if the\r\narticle is used in too small quantities. It should be observed, that\r\nherbs of all kinds should be gathered for peserving when in full bloom;\r\nbut when roots or barks are recommended, these should be collected in\r\nthe autumn months. The principles laid down for preserving dried plants\r\ngenerally, will apply to these parts also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IX.--PLANTS USED FOR CULINARY PURPOSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Man's first great ruling passion is to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following section I have confined myself principally to such as\r\nare in cultivation. There are many of our indigenous plants which, in\r\ntimes of scarcity, and in other cases of necessity, are used as food by\r\nthe people in the neighbourhood where they grow. But of these I shall\r\nmake a separate list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n409. ARTICHOKE. Cynara Scolymus.--We have several varieties of this\r\nplant in cultivation; but the most approved are the large green and the\r\nglobe. They are propagated by taking off the young suckers from the old\r\nroots in May, and planting them in a piece of rich land. Artichokes have\r\nbeen raised from seed, but they are seldom perfected in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n410. ARTICHOKE, JERUSALEM. Helianthus tuberosus.--Is cultivated for the\r\nsake of its tubers, similar to the potatoe; but they are not generally\r\nesteemed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n411. ASPARAGUS. Asparagus officinalis.--A very delicious vegetable in\r\nthe spring, and well known to all amateurs of gardening.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety called the Gravesend Asparagus, and another called\r\nthe Battersea; but it is the richness of the soil and manure that makes\r\nthe only difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n412. BASIL, SWEET. Ocymum Basilicum.--A pot-herb of considerable use for\r\nculinary purposes. It is an annual; and the seeds should be sown in a\r\nhot-bed in March, and transplanted into the open ground. It is usually\r\ndried as other pot-herbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n413. BEANS. Vicia Faba.--The varieties of the garden-beans are as\r\nfollow:--\r\n\r\nThe early Mazagan and Longpod are planted in November. These will\r\nusually be fit for use in June.\r\n\r\nThe Windsor.\r\nThe Toker.\r\nThe Sword Longpod.\r\nThe Green Toker.\r\nThe White-blossomed.\r\n\r\nThese are sown usually in succession from January to March, and afford a\r\ncontinuance of crop during the season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n414. BEANS, FRENCH OR KIDNEY. Phaseolus vulgaris.--The kidney beans are\r\nof two kinds; such as run up sticks and flower on the tops. Of this\r\ndescription we have in cultivation the following:--\r\n\r\nThe Scarlet Runner. The Dutch Runner.\r\n\r\nBoth these are much esteemed.\r\n\r\nOf dwarf kinds we have many varieties. The pollen of these plants is\r\nvery apt to become mixed; and, consequently, hybrid kinds differing in\r\nthe colour of the seeds are often produced. The season for sowing these\r\nis from April till June.\r\n\r\nThe Black, or Negro Beans. The Blue Dwarf. The Early Yellow. The Black\r\nSpeckled. The Red Speckled. The Magpie. The Canterbury.\r\n\r\nAll these varieties are good and early beans. The white Canterbury is\r\nthe kind most esteemed for pickling; the other sorts being all of them\r\nmore or less discoloured: and this kind is the sort generally sold for\r\nsuch purpose in the London markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n415. BEET, RED. Beta vulgaris v. rubra.--The roots of this variety are\r\nused both in soups and for early spring salads: it is cultivated by\r\nsowing the seeds in March; and the roots are usually kept all winter.\r\n\r\nThe white beet is only a variety of the other; and it is the tops that\r\nare usually eaten of this kind as a substitute for spinach. Its culture\r\nis the same as that of the red kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n416. BORECOLE. Brassica Rapa.--Of borecole we have two varieties; the\r\npurple, and green. The former is in much esteem amongst the Germans, who\r\nmake a number of excellent dishes from it in the winter.\r\n\r\nThe culture is the same as for winter cabbage of other kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n417. BRUSSELS SPROUTS. Brassica Rapa.--This is also a useful variety of\r\nthe cabbage species, which is very productive, forming a large number of\r\nbeautiful small close-headed cabbages on their high stalks in the winter\r\nseason. The seeds are sown in March.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n418. BURNET. Poterium Sanguisorba.--The young leaves of this plant are\r\neaten with other tender herbs in the spring, and are considered a\r\nwholesome addition to mustard, cress, corn-salad, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n419. CABBAGE. Brassica oleracea.--The varieties of cabbage are numerous.\r\nThe most esteemed are,\r\n\r\nThe Early York. The Early Sugar-loaf. The Early Battersea. The Early\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nThey are all sown in August, and planted out for an early summer-crop,\r\nand are usually in season in May and June.\r\n\r\nThe Large Battersea. The Red Cabbage. The Green Savoy. The White Savoy.\r\n\r\nThese are usually sown in March, and planted for a winter crop.\r\n\r\nThe use and qualities of the cabbage are too well known to need any\r\nfurther description.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420. CAULIFLOWER. Brassica oleracea var.--The varieties are,\r\n\r\nThe Early. The Late.\r\n\r\nThe early cauliflower is sown in the first week in September, and\r\nusually sheltered under bell or hand glasses during the winter. By this\r\nmeans the crop is fit for table in the months of May and June.\r\n\r\nThe late sort is usually sown in the month of March, and planted out for\r\na succession to the first crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n421. CAPERS. Capparis spinosa.--This is the flower-pod before it opens\r\nof the above shrub, and is only kept as an ornamental plant here. I am\r\ninduced to notice this plant, as I have known some things used in\r\nmistake for capers that are dangerous. I once saw an instance of this,\r\nin the seed-vessels of the Euphorbia Lathyris (which is a poisonous\r\nplant) being pickled by an ignorant person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n422. CAPSICUM. Capsicum annuum.--Cayenne pepper is made from a small\r\nvariety of this plant.\r\n\r\nWe have many varieties cultivated here in hot-beds; namely, yellow and\r\nred, of various shapes, as long, round, and heart-shaped. All these are\r\nvery useful, either pickled by themselves, or mixed with any other\r\nsubstances, as love-apple, radish pods, &c. to which they impart a very\r\nfine warm flavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n423. CARROT. Daucus Carota.--\r\n\r\nThe Orange Carrot.--For winter use.\r\n\r\nThe Early Horn ditto.--For summer use.--The former is usually sown in\r\nMarch; the latter being smaller, and more early, is commonly raised on\r\nhot-beds. The Early Horn Carrot may likewise be sown in August, and is\r\ngood all winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n424. CELERY. Apium graveolens.--Celery is now so generally known as to\r\nrender a description of the plant useless; nor need it be told, that the\r\nstalks blanched are eaten raw, stewed, &c. It should be used with great\r\ncaution, if grown in wet land, as it has been considered poisonous in\r\nsuch cases. The season of sowing celery is in April. We have a variety\r\nof this, which is red, and much esteemed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n425. CELERIAC. This is a variety of the Apium graveolens. It is hollow\r\nin the stem, and the roots are particularly large: although this is much\r\nused in Germany, it is not so much esteemed by us as the celery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n426. CHAMPIGNON. Agaricus pratensis.--This plant is equal in flavour to\r\nthe mushroom when boiled or stewed: it is rather dry, and has little or\r\nno scent whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n427. CHARDOONS. Cynara Cardunculus.--The gardeners blanch the stalks as\r\nthey do celery; and they are eaten raw with oil, pepper, and vinegar;\r\nor, if fancy directs, they are also either boiled or stewed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n428. CHERVIL. Scandix Cerefolium.--This plant is so much used by the\r\nFrench and Dutch, that there is scarcely a soup or salad but what\r\nchervil makes part of it: it is grateful to the taste. See article\r\noenanthe crocata in the Poisonous Plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n429. CIVES. Allium Schoenoprasum.--This is an excellent herb for salads\r\nin the spring: it is also useful for soups, &c. &c. It is perennial, and\r\npropagated by its roots, which readily part at any season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n430. CLARY. Salvia Sclarea.--The seeds are sown in autumn. It is\r\nbiennial. The recent leaves dipped in milk, and then fried in butter,\r\nwere formerly used as a dainty dish; but now it is mostly used as a\r\npot-herb, and for making an useful beverage called Clary Wine, viz.--Put\r\nfour pounds of sugar to five gallons of water, and the albumen of three\r\neggs well beaten; boil these together for about sixteen minutes, then\r\nskim the liquor; and when it is cool, add of the leaves and blossoms two\r\ngallons, and also of yeast half a pint; and when this is completed, put\r\nit all together into a vessel and stir it two or three times a-day till\r\nit has done fermenting, and then stop it close for two months:\r\nafterwards draw it into a clean vessel, adding to it a quart of good\r\nbrandy. In two months it will be fit to bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n431. COLEWORT. Brassica oleracea var.--This is a small variety of the\r\ncommon cabbage, which is sown in June, and planted out for autumn and\r\nwinter use. These are often found to stand the severe frosts of our\r\nwinter when the large sort of cabbages are killed; but its principal use\r\nwith gardeners is, to have a crop that will occupy the land after the\r\nbeans and pease are over, and perhaps Colewort is the most advantageous\r\nfor such purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n432. CORN SALAD. Valeriana Locusta.--An annual, growing wild in\r\nBattersea fields, and many other parts of this kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt is usually sown in August, and stands the winter perfectly well; it\r\nis very similar to lettuce, and is a good substitute for it in the\r\nspring and winter seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n433. COSTMARY Tanacetum Balsamita.--Is used as a herb in salad. This is\r\na perennial plant of easy culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n434. CRESS. Lepidium sativum.--There are two varieties of cress, the\r\ncurled and common. This is an ingredient with mustard in early salads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n435. CRESS, AMERICAN. Erysimum Barbarea.--This is cultivated for salads,\r\nand is much esteemed. It is increased by sowing the seeds in the spring.\r\nThis is only good in the winter and spring seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n436. CUCUMBERS. Cucumis sativus.--Many sorts of cucumbers are cultivated\r\nby gardeners. The most esteemed are,\r\n\r\nThe Southgate Cucumber. The Long Prickly. The Long Turkey. The White\r\nSpined.\r\n\r\nThe early crop is usually sown in hot-beds in the spring, and is a crop\r\non which most gardeners have always prided themselves, each on his best\r\nmode of management of this crop. They will also grow if sown in April,\r\nand planted out in the open ground.\r\n\r\nThe short prickly cucumber is grown for gerkins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n437. DILL. Anethum graveolens.--This is similar to fennel, and used in\r\npickling. It is esteemed useful as a medicinal herb also; which see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n438. ENDIVE. Cichorium Endivia.--Of this we have three varieties in\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nThe Green Curled. The White Curled. The Batavian, or Broad-leaved.\r\n\r\nThese are sown usually in June and July, and planted out for use in the\r\nautumn and winter. Endive is well known as forming a principal part of\r\nour winter salads; for which purpose, it is usual with gardeners to\r\nblanch it, by tying the plants up together, and laying them in dry\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n439. ESCHALOT. Allium ascalonium.--This species of allium is very\r\npungent: its scent is not unpleasant, but is very strong, and, in\r\ngeneral, it is preferred to the onion for making soups and gravies. It\r\nis propagated by planting the bulbs in September and October: they are\r\nfit to take up in May and June, when they are dried and kept for use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n440. FENNEL. Anethum Foeniculum.--The use of this plant is so well knwon\r\nin the kitchen, as to render an account of it useless. It is propagated\r\nby sowing seeds in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n441. GARLICK. Allium sativum.--This is used in the art of cookery in\r\nvarious ways, for soups, pickles, &c. It is cultivated by planting the\r\nsmall cloves or roots in the month of October. It is fit to pull up in\r\nspring; and the roots are dried for use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n442. GOURD. Cucurbita Melopepo.--The inhabitants of North America boil\r\nthe squash or melon gourds when about the size of small oranges, and eat\r\nthem with their meat. The pulp is used with sour apples to make pies. In\r\nscarcity it is a good substitute for fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n443. KOHLRABBI, or TURNEP-ROOTED CABBAGE. Brassica Rapa var.--We have\r\ntwo kinds of this in cultivation; but although these are both much eaten\r\nin Germany, they are not esteemed with us: in fact, we have so many\r\nvarieties of the cabbage kind all the year round for culinary purposes,\r\nthat nothing could much improve them. In countries further north than we\r\nare, this is probably an acquisition, as, from its hardiness, it is\r\nlikely to stand the frost better than some of the more delicate\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n444. LEEKS. Allium Porrum.--There are two kinds of leeks: the Welsh and\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nLeeks are used principally in soups; they partake much of the nature of\r\nonions, but for this purpose are in general more esteemed. This plant\r\nhas been so long cultivated in this country, that its native place is\r\nnot known.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are sown in the spring, and it is in use all the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n445. LETTUCE. Lactuca sativa.--The varieties of lettuce are many. They\r\nare,\r\n\r\nGreen Coss. White do. Silesia do. Brown do. Egyptian do. Brown Dutch.\r\nWhite Cabbage. Imperial. Hammersmith Hardy. Tennis-ball.\r\n\r\nThese are sown every summer month. The brown and Egyptian coss are sown\r\nin August, and commonly stand the winter; and in the spring are fit for\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n446. LOVE-APPLE. Solanum Lycopersicum.--The Portuguese and Spaniards are\r\nso very fond of this fruit, that there is not a soup or gravy but what\r\nthis makes an ingredient in; and it is deemed cooling and nutritive. It\r\nis also called Tomatas, or Tomatoes.\r\n\r\nThe green fruit makes a most excellent pickle with capsicums and other\r\nberries. It is annual, and raised in hot-bed, and planted out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n447. MARJORAM, WINTER. Origanum vulgare.--This is used as a sweet herb,\r\nand is a good appendage to the usual ingredients in stuffing, &c. It is\r\na perennial plant, and propagated by planting out its roots in the\r\nspring of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n448. MARJORAM, SWEET. Origanum Marjorana.--This is also used for the\r\nsame purpose as the last mentioned. It is an annual, and not of such\r\neasy culture as the last, requiring to be raised from seeds in an\r\nartificial heat. It is usually dried and kept for use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n449. MARYGOLD. Calendula officinalis.--An annual plant usually sown in\r\nthe spring. The petals of the flowers are eaten in broths and soups, to\r\nwhich they impart a very pleasant flavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n450. MUSHROOM. Agaricus campestris.--Is cultivated and well known at our\r\ntables for its fine taste and utility in sauces. These plants do not\r\nproduce seeds that can be saved; they are therefore cultivated by\r\ncollecting the spawn, which is found in old hot-beds and in meadow\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nVarious methods have been lately devised for raising mushrooms\r\nartificially: but none seem to be equal to those raised in beds, as is\r\ndescribed in all our books of gardening. Raising this vegetable in close\r\nrooms by fire heat has been found to produce them with a bad flavour;\r\nand they are not considered so wholesome as those grown in the open air,\r\nor when that element is admitted at times freely to the beds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n451. MUSTARD, WHITE. Sinapis alba.--This is sown early in the spring; to\r\nbe eaten as salad with cress and other things of the like nature; it is\r\nof easy culture. A salad of this kind may be readily raised on a piece\r\nof thick woollen-cloth, if the seeds are strewed thereon and kept damp;\r\na convenient mode practised at sea on long voyages. Cress and rap may be\r\nraised in the same manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n452. ONION. Allium oleraceum.--The kinds of onions in cultivation are,\r\n\r\nThe Deptford. The Reading. The White Spanish. The Portugal. The Globe,\r\nand The Silver skinned.\r\n\r\nAll these varieties are usually sown in the spring of the year, and are\r\ngood either eaten in their young state, or after they are dried in the\r\nwinter. The silver skinned kind is mostly in use for pickling. The globe\r\nand Deptford kinds are remarkable for keeping late in the spring. A\r\nportion of all the other sorts should be sown, as they are all very\r\ngood, and some kinds will keep, when others will not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n453. ONION, WELSH. Allium fistulosum.--This is sown in August for the\r\nsake of the young plants, which are useful in winter salads, and are\r\nmore hardy than the other cultivated sorts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n454. PARSLEY. Petroselium vulgare.--A well known potherb sown in the\r\nspring; and the plants, if not suffered to go to seed, will last two\r\nyears. See aethusa Cynapium, in Poisonous Plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n455. PARSNEP. Pastinaca sativa.--This is a well known esculent root, and\r\nis raised by sowing the seeds in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n456. PEA. Pisum sativum.--This is a well known dainty at our tables\r\nduring spring and summer. The varieties in cultivation are,\r\n\r\nTurner's Early Frame. Early Charlton. Golden Hotspur. Double Dwarf.\r\n\r\nThese are usually sown in November and December, and will succeed each\r\nother in ripening in June, if the season is fine, and afford a crop all\r\nthat month.\r\n\r\nThe Dwarf Marrow-fat. The Royal Dwarf. The Prussia Blue. The Spanish\r\nDwarf.\r\n\r\nThese varieties are usually sown in gardens when it is not convenient to\r\nhave them grow up sticks, being all of a dwarf kind.\r\n\r\nThe Tall Marrow-fat. The Green Marrow-fat. The Imperial Egg Pea. The\r\nRose, or Crown Pea. The Spanish Morotto. Knight's Marrow Pea. The Grey\r\nRouncival. The Sickle Pea.\r\n\r\nThis last variety has no skin in the pods. These are used as kidney\r\nbeans, as also in the usual way. These varieties are of very large\r\ngrowth, and are only to be cultivated when there is considerable room,\r\nand must be supported on sticks placed in the ground for that purpose.\r\nThe grey pea is usually eaten when in a dry state boiled. Hot grey peas\r\nused to be an article of common sale among our itinerant traders in\r\nLondon streets, but it has been dropped for some years. One or other of\r\nthe different kinds of the larger varieties should be put into the\r\nground every three weeks from March to the 1st week in June, and a crop\r\nis thereby insured constantly till the beginning of October.\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked, that peas, as well as all vegetable seeds, are\r\nliable to sport and become hybrid sorts; some of which are at times\r\nsaved for separate culture, and are called, when found good, by\r\nparticular names; so that every twenty or thirty years many of the kinds\r\nare changed. Thus Briant, in his Flora Diaetetica, enumerates fourteen\r\nvarieties, a few only of which bear the same name as those now in the\r\nlist of the London seedsmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n457. POMPION. Cucurbita Pepo.--This is of the gourd species, and grows\r\nto a large size. It is not much in use with us: but in the south of\r\nEurope the inhabitants use the pulp with some acid fruits for pastry,\r\nand it is there very useful. It is also sometimes used in a similar\r\nmanner here with apples. Almost all the gourd species are similar in\r\ntaste and nutriments when used this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n458. PURSLANE. Portulaca oleracea.--Two kinds of Purslane, the green and\r\nthe golden, are cultivated. These are eaten with vinegar, &c. the same\r\nas other salad oils, and are a fine vegetable in warm weather. The seeds\r\nare usually sown in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n459. RADISH. Raphanus sativus.--The varieties in cultivation are,\r\n\r\nThe Early Scarlet. The Early Purple Short-top. The Salmon Radish. The\r\nWhite Turnip Radish. The Red Turnip Radish. The Black Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe above are sown almost every month in the year, and when the weather\r\nis fine, every good garden may have a supply all the year of those\r\nuseful and wholesome vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe black Spanish radish is a large rooted variety usually sown in\r\nAugust, and is eaten in the winter season.\r\n\r\nThe poor labouring man's fare, which is usually eaten under the hedge of\r\nthe field of his employment, is often accompanied with a dried onion;\r\nand was this root more known than it generally is, it would yield him,\r\nat the expense of two-pence, with a little labour in his cottage garden,\r\nan equally pleasant and more useful sauce to his coarse but happy meals.\r\nI have observed many instances of this oeconomy amongst the labouring\r\nclasses in my youth, but fear it is not quite so commonly made use of in\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n460. RADISH, HORSE. Cochlearia Armoracea.--The root of this vegetable is\r\na usual accompaniment to the loyal and standard English dishes, the\r\nsmoking baron and the roast surloin; with which it is most generally\r\nesteemed.\r\n\r\nIt should not be passed unnoticed here, that this very grateful and\r\nwholesome root is not at all times to be eaten with impunity. One or two\r\ninstances of its deleterious effects have been witnessed by my much\r\nesteemed friend Dr. Taylor, the worthy Secretary at the Society of Arts,\r\nand which he has communicated to me. I shall insert his own words,\r\nparticularly as it may be the means of preventing the botanical student\r\nfrom falling into the same error, after arriving with the usual good\r\nappetite, from his recreative task of herborizing excursions. \"Some\r\ngentlemen having ordered a dinner at a tavern, of which scraped\r\nhorse-radish was one; some persons in company took a small quantity, and,\r\ndipping it in salt, ate of it: these were soon seized with a suppression\r\nof urine, accompanied with inflammation of the kidneys, which shortly\r\nafter proved fatal to one of the company. The Doctor was consulted; but\r\nnot knowing exactly the cause of the complaint, of course was at a loss\r\nto apply a remedy in time. But another circumstance of the like nature\r\nhaving come under his notice, and being apprized of it, by a well\r\napplied corrective medicine he recovered the patient. It should,\r\ntherefore, be made a general observation, under such circumstances, and\r\nthose are not the most unpleasant we meet with in our researches, 'never\r\nto eat horse-radish on an empty stomach.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n461. RAMPION. Campanula Rapunculus.--This plant is remarkable for its\r\nmilky juice. In France, it is cultivated for its roots, which are boiled\r\nand eaten with salads; but in England it is little noticed, except by\r\nthe French cooks, who use it as an ingredient in their soups and\r\ngravies. It is propagated by planting its roots in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n462. RHAPONTIC RHUBARB. Rheum Rhaponticum.--The radical leaf-stalks of\r\nthis plant being thick and juicy, and having an acid taste, are\r\nfrequently used in the spring as a substitute for gooseberries before\r\nthey are ripe, in making puddings, pies, tarts, &c. If they are peeled\r\nwith care, they will bake and boil very well, and eat agreeably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n463. ROCAMBOLE. Allium sativum.--The rocambole is merely the bulbs on\r\nthe top of the flower-stalk of the garlic, it being a viviparous plant.\r\nThe flavour of this being somewhat different, is used in the kitchen\r\nunder the above name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n464. SAGE. Salvia officinalis.--Of this we have two varieties, green and\r\nred. The latter is considered the best for culinary purposes: it is the\r\nwell-known sauce for geese and other water-fowl. It is propagated by\r\ncuttings in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n465. SALSAFY. Tragopogon porrifolium.--A biennial, sown in March, and is\r\nusually in season during winter. The roots are the parts used, which are\r\nvery sweet, and contain a large quantity of milky juice: it is a good\r\nvegetable plain boiled, and the professors of cookery make many fine\r\ndishes of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n466. SAVORY, SUMMER. Satureja hortensis.\r\n\r\n467. SAVORY, WINTER. Satureja montana.\r\n\r\nBoth sorts are used for the same purposes, as condiments among other\r\nherbs for stuffing, and are well known to cooks. The former is an\r\nannual, and raised by sowing the seeds in March and April. The other,\r\nbeing perennial, is propagated either by the same means or by cuttings\r\nin the spring of the year. It is also dried for winter use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n468. SAVOY CABBAGE. Brassica oleracea, (var.)\r\n\r\nThe Green Savoy. The White or Yellow Savoy.\r\n\r\nA well-known species of cabbage grown for winter use, and is one of our\r\nbest vegetables of that season. It is raised by sowing the seeds in May,\r\nand planting the plants in any spot of ground in July after a crop of\r\npeas or beans. Savoys stand the frost better than most other kinds of\r\ncabbages with close heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n469. SCORZONERA. Scorzonera tingitana.--The roots of this are very\r\nsimilar to salsafy, and its culture and use nearly the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n470. SEA KALE. Crambe maritima.--This grows wild on our sea-coasts,\r\nparticularly in Devonshire, where it has long been gathered and eaten by\r\nthe inhabitants thereabouts. It was used also to be cultivated; but was\r\nin general lost to our gardens, till my late partner, Mr. Curtis, having\r\npaid a visit to his friend Dr. Wavell at Barnstaple, found it at that\r\ngentleman's table; and on his return he collected some seeds, and\r\nplanted a considerable spot of ground with it at Brompton in 1792; at\r\nwhich time it was again introduced to Covent-Garden, but with so little\r\nsuccesss, that no person was found to purchase it, and consequently the\r\ncrop was useless.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated botanist, however, published a small tract on its uses\r\nand culture, which met with a considerable sale, and introduced it again\r\nto general cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe seeds should be sown in March, and the following year the plants are\r\nfit for forming plantations, when they should be put out in rows about\r\nthree feet apart, and one foot in the row. The vegetable is blanched\r\neither by placing over the crowns of the root an empty garden-pot, or by\r\nearthing it up as is usually done with celery. It is easily forced, by\r\nplacing hot dung on the pots; and is brought forward in January, and\r\nfrom thence till May.\r\n\r\nIt has been noticed of sea-kale, that, on eating it, it does not impart\r\nto the urine that strong and unpleasant scent which asparagus and other\r\nvegetables do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n471. SKIRRETS. Sium Sisarum.--The roots of this plant are very similar\r\nto parsneps, both in flavour and quality; they are rather sweeter, and\r\nnot quite so agreeable to some palates. It is a biennial sown in March,\r\nand used all the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n472. SORREL, COMMON. Rumex Acetosa.--Bryant says the Irish, who are\r\nparticularly fond of acids, eat the leaves with their milk and fish; and\r\nthe Laplanders use the juice of them as rennet to their milk. The\r\nGreenlanders cure themselves of the scurvy, with the juice mixed with\r\nthat of the scurvy-grass. The seeds may be sown, or the roots planted,\r\nin spring or autumn; it is not in general cultivation, but is to be\r\nfound abundantly wild in meadows, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n473. SORREL, ROUND-LEAVED, or FRENCH. Rumex scutatus.--The leaves of the\r\nplant have more acidity in them than the common; and although not in\r\ngeneral use, it is one of the best salad-herbs in the early part of the\r\nyear: it is propagated in the same mode as the common sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n474. SPINACH, Spinacia oleracea.---Two sorts of this vegetable are\r\ncultivated. The Round-leaved, which is very quick in its growth, is sown\r\nfor summer use; and if the seeds are put into the ground every three\r\nweeks, a constant succession is obtained while the weather is warm; but\r\nfrost will soon destroy it.\r\n\r\nThe Prickly Spinach is not so quick in growth, and is hardy enough to\r\nstand our winters: it is therefore sown in August, and succeeds the\r\nround-leaved sort; and is a good vegetable all our winter months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n475. TARRAGON. Artemisia Dracunculus.--The leaves of this make a good\r\ningredient with salad in the spring; and it also makes an excellent\r\npickle. It is propagated by planting the small roots in spring or\r\nautumn, being a perennial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n476. THYME. Thymus vulgaris.--This is a well-known potherb used in\r\nbroths and various modes of cookery: it is propagated by seeds and\r\ncuttings early in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n477. TRUFFLES. Lycoperdon Tuber.--Not in cultivation. The poor people in\r\nthis country find it worth their while to train up dogs for the purpose\r\nof finding them, which, by having some frequently laid in their way,\r\nbecome so used to it, that they will scrape them up in the woods; hence\r\nthey are called Truffle-dogs. The French cooks use them in soups, &c. in\r\nthe same manner as mushrooms. The truffle is mostly found in beech\r\nwoods: I have mentioned this, because it is very generally met with at\r\ntable, although it is not in cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n478. TURNEPS. Brassica Rapa.--The varieties in use for garden culture\r\nare, the Early Dutch, the Early Stone, and the Mouse-tail Turnep. The\r\nculture and uses of the turnep are too well known to require any\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThe country people cut a raw turnep in thin slices, and a lemon in the\r\nsame manner: and by placing the slices alternately with sugar-candy\r\nbetween each, the juice of the turnep is extracted, and is used as a\r\npleasant and good remedy in obstinate coughs, and will be found to\r\nrelieve persons thus afflicted, if taken immediately after each fit.\r\nAlthough this is one of the remedies my young medical friends may be led\r\nto despise, yet I would, nevertheless, advise them to make use of it\r\nwhen need occasions.\r\n\r\nThe yellow turnep is also much esteemed as a vegetable; but is dry, and\r\nvery different in taste from any of the common kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION X.--CULINARY PLANTS NOT IN CULTIVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following section cannot be too closely studied by people in all\r\nranks of life. Many of our most delicate vegetables are found growing\r\nwild; and in times of scarcity, and after hard winters, many articles of\r\nthis department will be found highly acceptable to all, and the\r\ncondition of the poorer classes would be bettered by a more intimate\r\nknowledge of those plants. In fact, these and the medicinal plants ought\r\nto be known to every one: and in order to facilitate the study of them,\r\nI have been thus particular in my description of the different kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n479. AGARIC, ORANGE. Agaricus deliciosus.--This agaric well boiled and\r\nseasoned with pepper and salt, has a flavour similar to that of a\r\nroasted muscle. In this way the French, in general, make use of it. It\r\nis in high perfection about September, and is chiefly to be found in dry\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n480. ALEXANDERS. Smyrnium Olustratum.--If the poorer people were aware\r\nof the value of this plant, which is now quite neglected, it might be\r\nturned to good account as an article of food, and that, in all\r\nlikelihood, of the most wholesome kind.\r\n\r\nBryant thinks it was much esteemed by the monks, and states that it has,\r\never since the destruction of the abbeys in this country, remained in\r\nmany places growing among the rubbish; hence the reason of its being\r\nfound wild in such places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n481. ALEXANDERS, ROUND-LEAVED. Smyrnium perfoliatum.---It is said that\r\nthe leaves and stalks boiled are more pleasant to the taste than the\r\nother kind of Alexanders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n482. ARROWHEAD. Sagittaria sagittifolia.--The roots of this plant are\r\nsaid to be very similar to the West-India arrow-root. They are sometimes\r\ndried and pounded, but are reported to have an acrid unpleasant taste;\r\nbut this might perhaps be got rid of by washing the powder in water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n483. BLACKBERRY. Rubus fruticosus.--The berries of this plant are well\r\nknown in the country; but if too many be eaten, they are apt to cause\r\nswelling in the stomach, sickness, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n484. BRIONY, BLACK. Tamus communis.--Although this is considered a\r\npoisonous plant, the young leaves and shoots are eaten boiled by the\r\ncommon people in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n485. BURDOCK. Arctium Lappa.--Mr. Bryant in his Flora Diaetetica says\r\nthat many people eat the tenders talks of this plant boiled as\r\nasparagus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n486. BURNET. Sanguisorba officinalis.--The young leaves form a good\r\ningredient in salads. They have somewhat the flavour of cucumbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n487. BUTTERWORT. Pinguicula vulgaris.--The inhabitants of Lapland and\r\nthe north of Sweden give to milk the consistence of cream by pouring it\r\nwarm from the cow upon the leaves of this plant, and then instantly\r\nstraining it and laying it aside for two or three days till it acquires\r\na degree of acidity.\r\n\r\nThis milk they are extremely fond of; and once made, they need not\r\nrepeat the use of the leaves as above, for a spoonful or less of it will\r\nturn another quantity of warm milk, and make it like the first, and so\r\non, as often as they please to renew their food.--Lightfoot's Flor.\r\nScot. p. 77.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n488. CHAMPIGNON. Agaricus pratensis.--There is little or no smell to be\r\nperceived in this plant, and it is rather dry; yet when boiled or stewed\r\nit communicates a good flavour, and is equal to the common mushroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n489. CHANTARELLE. Agaricus Chantarellus.--This agaric, when broiled with\r\npepper and salt, has a taste very similar to that of a roasted cockle,\r\nand is considered by the French a great delicacy. It is found\r\nprincipally in woods and old pastures, and is in good perfection about\r\nthe middle of September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n490. CHARLOCK. Sinapis arvensis.--The young plant is eaten in the spring\r\nas turnep-tops, and is considered not inferior to that vegetable. The\r\nseeds of this have sometimes been saved and sold for feeding birds\r\ninstead of rape; but being hot in its nature, it has been known to cause\r\nthem to be diseased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n491. CHICKWEED. Alsine media.--This is a remarkably good herb boiled in\r\nthe spring; a circumstance not sufficiently attended to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n492. CLOUD-BERRY. Rubus Chamaemorus.--This plant grows wild in some parts\r\nof the north of England: the fruit has nearly the shape of the currant,\r\nand is reckoned in Norway, where it grows abundantly, a favourite dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n493. COTTON-THISTLE. Onopordon Acanthium.--The tender stalks of this\r\nplant, peeled and boiled, are by some considered good; but it has a\r\npeculiar taste which is not agreeable to all.\r\n\r\nBryant in his Flora Diaetetica says that the bottoms of the flowers are\r\neaten as artichokes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n494. COW-PARSNEP. Heracleum Sphondylium.--The inhabitants of Kamschatka\r\nabout the beginning of July collect the foot-stalks of the radical\r\nleaves of this plant, and, after peeling off the rind, dry them\r\nseparately in the sun; and then tying them in bundles, they lay them up\r\ncarefully in the shade. In a short time afterwards, these dried stalks\r\nare covered over with a yellow saccharine efflorescence tasting like\r\nliquorice, and in this state they are eaten as a delicacy.\r\n\r\nThe Russians, not content with eating the stalks thus prepared, contrive\r\nto get a very intoxicating spirit from them, by first fermenting them in\r\nwater with the greater bilberry (Vaccinium uliginosum), and then\r\ndistilling the liquor to what degree of strength they please; which\r\nGmelin says is more agreeable to the taste than spirits made from corn.\r\nThis may, therefore, prove a good succedaneum for whisky, and prevent\r\nthe consumption of much barley, which ought to be applied to better\r\npurposes. Swine and rabbits are very fond of this plant.---Lightfoot's\r\nFl. Scot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n495. DANDELION. Leontodum Taraxacum.--This is a good salad when blanched\r\nin the spring. The French, who eat more vegetables than our country\r\npeople do, use this in the spring as a common dish: it is similar to\r\nendive in taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n496. DEWBERRY. Rubus caesius.--The dewberry is very apt to be mistaken\r\nfor the blackberry; but it may be easily distinguished by its fruit\r\nbeing not so large, and being covered with blue bloom similar to that\r\nseen on plums: it has a very pleasant taste, and is said to communicate\r\na grateful flavour to red wine when steeped in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n497. EARTH-NUT. Bunium Bulbocastanum.--The roots are eaten raw, and\r\nconsidered a delicacy here, but thought much more of in Sweden, where\r\nthey are an article of trade: they are eaten also stewed as chesnuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n498. ELDER. Sambucus nigra.--The young shoots of elder are boiled with\r\nother herbs in the spring and eaten; they are also very good pickled in\r\nvinegar. Lightfoot says, in some countries they dye cloth of a brown\r\ncolour with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n499. FAT-HEN. Chenopodium viride et album.--These are boiled and eaten\r\nas spinach, and are by no means inferior to that vegetable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n500. FUCUS, SWEET. Fucus saccharatus.--This grows upon rocks and stones\r\nby the sea-shore. It consists of a long single leaf, having a short\r\nroundish foot-stalk, the leaf representing a belt or girdle. This is\r\ncollected and eaten the same as laver, as are also the two following\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n501. FUCUS, PALMATED. Fucus palmatus.--This plant also grows by the\r\nsea-side, and has a lobed leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n502. FUCUS, FINGERED. Fucus digitatus.--This is also to be found by the\r\nsea-side, growing upon rocks and stones; it has long leaves springing in\r\nform of fingers when spread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n503. GOOD KING HENRY. Chenopodium Bonus-Henricus.--The leaves and stalk\r\nof this plant are much esteemed. The plant was used to be cultivated,\r\nbut of late years it has been superseded by the great number of other\r\nesculent vegetables more productive than this. The young shoots blanched\r\nwere accounted equal to asparagus, and were made use of in a similar\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n504. HEATH. Erica vulgaris.--Formerly the young tops are said to have\r\nbeen used alone to brew a kind of ale; and even now, I am informed, the\r\ninhabitants of Isla and Jura (two islands on the coast of Scotland)\r\ncontinue to brew a very potable liquor, by mixing two-thirds of the tops\r\nof heath with one of malt.--Lightfoot's Fl. Scot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n505. HOPS. Humulus Lupulus.--Independently of the great use of hops in\r\nmaking beer, and for medicinal uses, where the plant grows wild, it\r\naffords the neighbours a dainty in the spring months. The young shoots,\r\ncalled hop-tops, when boiled, are equal in flavour to asparagus, and are\r\neagerly sought after for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n506. LADIES-SMOCK. Cardamine pratensis.--This is good as a salad herb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n507. LAVER. Fucus esculentus.--This is collected by sailors and people\r\nalong the sea-coasts; is eaten both raw and boiled, and esteemed and\r\nexcellent antiscorbutic. The leaves of this Fucus are very sweet, and,\r\nwhen washed and hanged up to dry, will exude a substance like that of\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n508. MAPLE. Acer Pseudo-platanus.--By tapping this tree it yields a\r\nliquor not unlike that of the birch-tree, from which the Americans make\r\na sugar, and the Highlanders sometimes an agreeable and wholesome wine.\r\n--Lightfoot's Fl. Scot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n509. MARSH MARIGOLD. Caltha palustris.--The flower-buds, before opening,\r\nare picked, and are considered a good substitute for capers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n510. MEADOW-SWEET. Spiraea Filipendula.--The roots of this, in Sweden,\r\nare ground and made into bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n511. MILK-THISTLE. Carduus marianus.--The young leaves in the spring,\r\ncut close to the root with part of the stalks on, are said to be good\r\nboiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n512. MOREL. Phallus esculentus.--The morel grows in wet banks and moist\r\npastures. It is used by the French cooks, the same as the truffle, for\r\ngravies, but has not so good a flavour: it is in perfection in May and\r\nJune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n513. MUSHROOM, VIOLET. Agaricus violaceus.--This mushroom requires more\r\nbroiling than all the rest; but when well done and seasoned, it is very\r\ngood. It is found in dry woods, old pastures, &c. where it grows to a\r\nlarge size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n514. MUSHROOM, BROWN. Agaricus cinnamomeus.--The whole of this plant has\r\na nice smell, and when stewed or broiled has a pleasant flavour. It is\r\nto be found as the one above, and is fit for use in October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n515. ORPINE. Sedum telephium.--The leaves are eaten in salads, and are\r\nconsidered equal to purslane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n516. OX-TONGUE, COMMON. Picris Echioides.--The leaves are said to be\r\ngood boiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n517. PEAS, EARTH-NUT. Orobus tuberosus.--The roots of this, when boiled,\r\nare said to be nutritious. The Scotch Highlander chews the root as a\r\nsubstitute for tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n518. PILEWORT. Ranunculus Ficaria.--The young leaves in spring are\r\nboiled by the common people in Sweden, and eaten as greens. The roots\r\nare sometimes washed bare by the rains, so that the tubercles appear\r\nabove ground; and in this state have induced the ignorant in\r\nsuperstitious times to fancy that it has rained wheat, which these\r\ntubercles sometimes resemble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n519. SALEP. Orchis Morio.--The powder of these roots is used for a\r\nbeverage of that name. This is imported chiefly from Turkey. It grows in\r\nthis country, although it is never noticed: the roots are smaller than\r\nthose imported, but will answer the purpose equally well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n520. SALTWORT. Salicornia europaea.--This is gathered on the banks of the\r\nThames and Medway, and brought to London, where it is sold as samphire.\r\nIt makes a very good pickle, but by no means equal to the true kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n521. SAMPHIRE. Crithmum maritimum.--This has long been in much esteem as\r\na pickle: it grows on the high cliffs on the Kentish coast, where people\r\nmake a trade of collecting it by being let down from the upper part in\r\nbaskets. A profession of great danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n522. SCURVY-GRASS. Cochlearia officinalis.--The leaves are hot and\r\npungent, but are considered very good, and frequently eaten between\r\nbread and butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n523. SAUCE ALONE. Erysimum Alliaria.--This is very good boiled with\r\nsalt-meat in the spring, when other vegetables are scarce. It is\r\nvaluable to the poor people; and is, in general, a common plant under\r\nhedges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n524. SEA BINDWEED. Convolvulus Soldanella.--This plant is to be found\r\nplentifully on our maritime coasts, where the inhabitants plucks the\r\ntender stalks, and pickle them. It is considered to have a cathartic\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n525. SEA-PEAS. Pisum maritimum.--These peas have a bitterish\r\ndisagreeable taste, and are therefore rejected when more pleasant food\r\nis to be got. In the year 1555 there was a great famine in England, when\r\nthe seeds of this plant were used as food, and by which thousands of\r\nfamilies were preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n526. SEA-WORMWOOD. Artemisia maritima.--Those who travel the country in\r\nsearching after and gathering plants, if they chance to meet with sour\r\nor ill-tasted ale, may amend it by putting an infusion of sea-wormwood\r\ninto it, whereby it will be more agreeable to the palate, and less\r\nhurtful to the stomach.--Threlkeld. Syn. Pl. Hibern.\r\n\r\nThis is an ingredient in the common purl, the usual morning beverage of\r\nour hardy labouring men in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n527. SEA-ORACH, GRASS-LEAVED. Atriplex littoralis.--This plant is eaten\r\nin the same manner as the Chenopodium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n528. SEA-BEET. Beta maritima.--This is a common plant on some of our\r\nsea-coasts. The leaves are very good boiled, as are also the roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n529. SILVER-WEED. Potentilla anserina.--The roots of this plant taste\r\nlike parsneps, and are frequently eaten in Scotland either roasted or\r\nboiled.\r\n\r\nIn the islands of Tiras and Col they are much esteemed, as answering in\r\nsome measure the purposes of bread, they having been known to support\r\nthe inhabitants for months together during a scarcity of other\r\nprovisions. They put a yoke on their ploughs, and often tear up their\r\npasture-grounds with a view to get the roots for their use; and as they\r\nabound most in barren and impoverished soils, and in seasons when other\r\ncrops fail, they afford a most seasonable relief to the inhabitants in\r\ntimes of the greatest scarcity. A singular instance this of the bounty\r\nof Providence to these islands.--Lightfoot's Fl. Scot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n530. SOLOMON'S-SEAL. Convallaria Polygonatum.--The roots are made into\r\nbread, and the young shoots are eaten boiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n531. SPATLING-POPPY. Cucubalus Behen.--Our kitchen-gardens scarcely\r\nafford a better-flavoured vegetable than the young tender shoots of this\r\nwhen boiled. They ought to be gathered when they are not above two\r\ninches long. If the plant was in cultivation, no doubt but what it would\r\nbe improved, and would well reward the gardener's trouble: it sends\r\nforth a vast quantity of sprouts, which might be nipped off when of a\r\nproper size; and there would be a succession of fresh ones for at least\r\ntwo months.\r\n\r\nIt being a perennial too, the roots might be transplanted into beds like\r\nthose of asparagus.--Bryant's Fl. Diaetetica, p. 64.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n532. SPEEDWELL. Veronica spicata.--This is used by our common people as\r\na substitute for tea, and is said to possess a somewhat astringent\r\ntaste, like green tea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n533. SPOTTED HAWKWEED. Hypochaeris maculata.--The leaves are eaten as\r\nsalad, and are also boiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n534. STINGING-NETTLE. Urtica dioica.--The young shoots in the spring are\r\neaten boiled with fat meat, and are esteemed both wholesome and\r\nnutritive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n535. SHRUBBY STRAWBERRY. Rubus arcticus.--The fruit of this plant is\r\nvery similar in appearance to a strawberry: its odour is of the most\r\ngrateful kind; and its flavour has that delicate mixture of acid and\r\nsweet, which is not to be equalled by our best varieties of that fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n536. SWEET CICELY. Scandix odorata.--The leaves used to be employed in\r\nthe kitchen as those of cervil. The green seeds ground small, and used\r\nwith lettuce or other cold salads, give them an agreeable taste. It also\r\ngrows in abundance in some parts of Italy, where it is considered as a\r\nvery useful vegetable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n537. WATER-CRESS. Sisymbrium Nasturtium.--A well known herb in common\r\nuse, but is not in cultivation, although it is one of our best salads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n538. WILLOW-HERB. Epilobium angustifolium.--The young shoots of these\r\nare eaten as asparagus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XI.--PLANTS USEFUL IN DYEING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no department of the oeconomy of vegetables in which we are more\r\nat a loss than in the knowledge of their colouring principles; and as\r\nthis subject presents to the student an opportunity of making many\r\ninteresting and useful experiments, I trust I shall stand excused, if I\r\nenter more fully into the nature of it than I have found it necessary to\r\ndo in some of the former sections.\r\n\r\nThe following list of plants, which is given as containing colours of\r\ndifferent kinds, are the same as have been so considered for many years\r\npast: for, latterly, little has been added to our stock of knowledge on\r\nthis head. It may however be proper to observe, that a great number of\r\nvegetables still contain this principle in a superior degree, and only\r\nwant the proper attention paid to the abstracting it.\r\n\r\nMost of our dyeing drugs are from abroad; and even the culture of\r\nmadder, which was once so much grown by our farmers, is now lost to us,\r\nto the great advantage of the Dutch, who supply our markets. But there\r\nis no reason why the agriculturist, or the artisan, should be so much\r\nbeholden to a neighbouring nation, as to pay them enormous prices for\r\narticles which can be so readily raised at home; and, according to the\r\ngeneral report of the consumers, managed in a way far superior to what\r\nit generally is when imported.\r\n\r\nLet the botanical student therefore pay attention to this particular;\r\nfor it is a wide field, in which great advantages may be reaped, either\r\nin this country or in any other part of the world where he may hereafter\r\nbecome an inhabitant.\r\n\r\nThe art of dyeing, generally considered, is kept so great a secret, that\r\nfew persons have had the opportunity of making experiments. The\r\nextracting colours from their primitive basis is a chemical operation,\r\nand cannot be expected in this place; but as some persons may be\r\ninclined to ascertain these properties of vegetables, I shall go just so\r\nfar into the subject as to give an idea of the modes generally used; and\r\nto state the principles on which the colouring property is fixed when\r\napplied to the purposes of dyeing cloth.\r\n\r\nIn the article Madder, page 32, I mentioned having made an extract\r\nsimilar to the Adrianople red. For which purpose, a sufficient quanitity\r\nof the roots should be taken fresh out of the ground, washed clean from\r\nthe dirt, bruised in a mortar, and then boiled in rain-water till the\r\nwhole becomes tinged of a red colour, then put into a cloth and all the\r\ncolouring matter pressed out. This should again be put into hot water in\r\na clean glazed earthen-pan, to which should be added a small quantity of\r\nwater in which alum had been dissolved, and the whole stirred up\r\ntogether; then immediately add a lump of soda or pot-ash, stirring the\r\nwhole up, when an effervescence will take place, the allum that had\r\nunited with the juice of the madder will be found to become neutralized\r\nby the pot-ash, and the result will be a precipitate of the red fecula.\r\nThis may be washed over in different waters, and either put by for use\r\nin a liquid state, or filtered and dried in powder or cakes. Most\r\nvegetable colours will not, however, admit of being extracted by water,\r\nand it is necessary to use an acid for that purpose: vinegar is the most\r\ncommon. But in making the extract from roots with acids, great care\r\nshould be taken that they are sufficiently cleared from mould, sand,\r\n&c.; for, if the same should contain either iron, or any metallic\r\nsubstance, its union with the acid will cause a blackness, and of course\r\nspoil the tint. In a similar mode are all the different colouring\r\nprinciples extracted, either from leaves, flowers, fruits, or woods. The\r\npreparation of woad is a curious process on similar principles; which\r\nsee in page 31.\r\n\r\nWeld, or dyers weed, is generally used after it is dried. The whole\r\nplant is ground in a mill, and the extract made by boiling it. It is\r\nthen managed with alum and acids agreeably to the foregoing rules, which\r\nare necessary for throwing out the colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstructions how Substances may be tried, whether they are serviceable\r\nin Dyeing, from Hopson's Translation of Weigleb's Chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In order to discover if any vegetable contains a colouring principle\r\nfit for dyeing, it should be bruised and boiled in water, and a bit of\r\ncotton, linen, or woollen stuff, which has previously been well cleaned,\r\nboiled in this decoction for a certain time, and rinsed out and dried.\r\nIf the stuff becomes coloured, it is a sign that the colour may be\r\neasily extracted; but if little or no colour be perceived, we are not\r\nimmediately to conclude that the body submitted to the trial has no\r\ncolour at all, but must first try how it will turn out with the addition\r\nof saline substances. It ought, therefore, to be boiled with pot-ash,\r\ncommon salt, sal ammoniac, tartar, vinegar, alum, or vitriol, and then\r\ntried upon the stuff: if it then exhibit no colour, it may safely be\r\npronounced to be unfit for dyeing with. But if it yields a dye or\r\ncolour, the nature of this dye must then be more closely examined, which\r\nmay be done in the following manner:--\r\n\r\nLet a saturated decoction of the colouring substance be well clarified,\r\ndistributed into different glass vessels, and its natural colour\r\nobserved. Then to one portion of it let there be added a solution of\r\ncommon salt; to the second, some sal ammoniac; and to the third, alum;\r\nto the fourth, pot-ash; to the fifth, vitriolic or marine acid; and to\r\nthe sixth, some green vitriol: and the mixtures be suffered to stand\r\nundisturbed for the space of twenty-four hours. Now in each of these\r\nmixtures the change of colour is to be observed, as likewise whether it\r\nyields a precipitate or not.\r\n\r\nIf the precipitate by the pure acid dissolve in an alkaline lixivium\r\nentirely, and with a colour, they may be considered as resino-\r\nmucilaginous particles, in which the tingeing property of the\r\nbody must be looked for, which, in its natural state, subsists in an\r\nalkalino-saponaceous compound. But if the precipitate be only partly\r\ndissolved in this manner, the dissolved part will then be of the nature\r\nof a resinous mucilage, which in the operation has left the more earthy\r\nparts behind. But if nothing be precipitated by the acids, and the\r\ncolour of the decoction is rendered brighter, it is a mark of an\r\nacido-mucilaginous compound, which cannot be separated by acids. In this\r\nthere are mostly commonly more earthy parts, which are soon made to\r\nappear by the addition of an alkali.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the instances in which green vitriol has been added, a black\r\nprecipitate is produced, it indicates an astringent earthy compound, in\r\nwhich there are few mucilaginous particles. The more the colour verges\r\nto black, the more of this acid and mucilaginous substance will be found\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nThe mixture of alum with a tingeing decoction shows by the coloured\r\nprecipitate that ensues from it, on the one hand, the colour it yields,\r\nand on the other hand, by the precipitate dissolving either partly or\r\nentirely in a strong alkaline lixivium, whether or not some of the earth\r\nof alum has been precipitated together with the colouring particles.\r\nSuch substances as these must not, in general, be boiled with alum,\r\nalthough this latter ingredient may be very properly used in the\r\npreparation of the stuff.\r\n\r\nWhen a tingeing decoction is precipitated by an alkaline lixivium, and\r\nthe precipitate is not redissolved by any acid, for the most part\r\nneither one nor the other of these saline substances ought to be used,\r\nbut the neutral salts will be greatly preferable. In all these\r\nobservations that are made with respect to the precipitation effected by\r\nmeans of different saline substances, attention must be paid at the same\r\ntime to the change of colour which ensues, in order to discover whether\r\nthe colour brightens, or entirely changes.\r\n\r\nWhen the colour of a decoction is darkened by the above-mentioned\r\nadditions without becoming turbid, it shows that the colouring matter is\r\nmore concentrated and inspissated. When the colour is brightened, a\r\ngreater degree of solution and attenuation has taken place in the\r\ncolouring matter in consequence of the addition. If the colour becomes\r\nclearer, and after a little time some of the tingeing substance is\r\nseparated, it shows that part of the colour is developed, but that\r\nanother part has been set loose from its combination by the saline\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nBut if the colouring matter is separated in great abundance by the\r\nsaline addition, (the colour being brightened at the same time,) it may\r\nbe considered as a sign that the colouring substance is entirely\r\nseparated from the decoction, and that only an inconsiderable part, of a\r\ngummy nature, remains behind united with the additaments, which is in a\r\nvery diluted state.--This is an effect of the solution of tin, as also\r\nsometimes of the pure acids.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, a portion of the colouring substance be separated by a\r\nsaline addition, but the rest of the colouring decoction becomes\r\nnot-withstanding darker, it shows that the rest of the colouring\r\nparticles have been more concentrated, and hence have acquired a greater\r\npower of tingeing. With regard to the proportion of the addition, the\r\nfollowing circumstances may serve by way of guide:\r\n\r\nWhen the colour of a decoction is darkened by the addition, without any\r\nprecipitate being produced, no detriment can easily arise from using a\r\nredundancy of it, because the colour will not be further darkened by it.\r\nBut if the colour be required to be brighter, the trial must first be\r\nmade, which is the proportion by which the colour is darkened the most,\r\nand then less of it must be employed.\r\n\r\nWhen the colour of a decoction is brightened by an addition without a\r\nprecipitation ensuing, this addition can never be used in a larger\r\nquantity without hurting the colouring particles; because the colouring\r\nparticles would be made too light, and almost entirely destroyed.--Such\r\nis the consequence of too large an addition of the solution of tin or of\r\na pure acid.\r\n\r\nWhen the addition produces a brighter colour, and part only of the\r\ncolouring substance is separated without a further addition occasioning\r\na fresh separation, somewhat more of it than what is wanted may be added\r\nto produce the requisite shading; because experience shows that, by this\r\nmeans, a greater quantity of tingeing particles is united with the\r\nwoolly fibres of the cloth, and is capable of being, as it were,\r\nconcentrated in them: for which purpose, however, these barks must be\r\nboiled down. This effect is chiefly observed with sal ammoniac and wine\r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\nWhen by an addition which causes a separation of the colouring substance\r\nthe colour becomes brighter in proportion the more there is used of it,\r\nit must be employed in a moderate quantity only; because otherwise, more\r\nand more of the colouring substance will be separated, and its tingeing\r\npower diminished. But when a colour is rendered dark at first by an\r\naddition, and afterwards, upon more of the same substance being added,\r\nbecomes brighter, and this in proportion to the quantity that is added,\r\nit will be found that the darkening power has its determined limits; and\r\nthat, for producing the requisite degree of darkness, neither too much\r\nnor too little must be taken.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo the before-mentioned principles also, the different proofs bear a\r\nreference, by which the fixity and durability of the colour with which a\r\nstuff has been dyed may be tried. Of these, some may be called natural,\r\nother artificial. The natural proof consists in exposing the dyed stuff\r\nto the air, sun, and rain. If the colour is not changed by this exposure\r\nin twelve or fourteen days, it may be considered as genuine; but if it\r\nis, the contrary is allowed. This proof, however, is not adapted to\r\nevery colour; because some of them resist it, and yet will fade in\r\nconsequence of the application of certain acids; others, on the\r\ncontrary, that can not resist the natural proof remain unchanged by the\r\nlatter. Colours, therefore, may be arranged in three classes; and to\r\neach of these a particular kind of artificial proof allotted. The first\r\nclass is tried with alum, the second with soap, and the third with\r\ntartar.\r\n\r\nFor the proof with alum: Half an ounce of this is dissolved in one pound\r\nof boiling water in an earthenware vessel; into this is put, for\r\ninstance, a drachm of yarn or worsted, or a piece of cloth of about two\r\nfingers breadth; this is suffered to boil for the space of five minutes,\r\nand is then washed in clean water. In this manner are tried crimson,\r\nscarlet, flesh-colour, violet, ponceau, peach-blossom colour, different\r\nshades of blue, and other colours bordring upon these.\r\n\r\nFor the proof with soap: Two drachms of this substance are boiled in a\r\npint of water, and the small piece of dyed stuff that is to be tried is\r\nput into it, and likewise suffered to boil for the space of five\r\nminutes. With this all sorts of yellow, green, madder-red, cinnamon, and\r\nsimilar colours, are tried.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner is made the proof with tartar; only this should be\r\npreviously pounded very small, in order that it may be more easily\r\ndissolved. With this all colours bordering upon the fawn are tried.\r\n\r\nFrom the above we discover that the art of applying and fixing colours\r\nin dyeing depends on the chemical affinity between the cloth and the\r\ndyeing principle: and accordingly as this is more or less strong, so is\r\nthe facility with which the substance is coloured, and on this the\r\ndeepness of the dye depends: for frequently one kind of cloth will be\r\nfound to receive no colour at all, whilst another will receive from the\r\nsame composition a deep tinge. Cotton, for instance, receives scarcely\r\nany tinge from the same bath that will dye woollen a deep scarlet. Wool\r\nis that which appears to have the strongest affinity to colouring\r\nmatter; next to it is silk; then linen; and cotton the weakest, and is\r\ntherefore the most difficult of all to dye perfectly. Thus, if a piece\r\nof linen cloth be dipped into a solution of madder, it will come out\r\njust tinged with the colour; but if a piece of the same be previously\r\ndipped into a solution of alum or copperas, and dried previously to\r\nbeing dipped in the madder, the alum will become so far impregnated with\r\nthe colouring principle, that the cloth will receive a perfect dye, and\r\nbe so fixed that it cannot be separated by any common means. Thus it\r\nwill be observed, that the art of dyeing permanent colours depends on\r\nthis intermediate principle, which is termed a mordant. These mordants\r\nare very numerous; and on a knowledge of them appears to rest the\r\nprincipal secret of dyeing. The following mode is, however, a very\r\nconvenient one for makig experiments on fixing the colouring principles\r\nof any vegetable extract: To have several pieces of cloth, woollen,\r\ncotton, silk, and linen, dipped in the different mordants, and by\r\nkeeping a small vessel filled with the colouring solution on a fire in a\r\nstate a little below boiling, by cutting small pieces of each, and\r\nimmersing them in the colour, and examining and comparing with each\r\nother. Experiments of this kind are well worth the attention of persons;\r\nfor, when we refer to this department, we shall find very few plants\r\nwhich are either now, or ever have been, cultivated for this purpose,\r\nalthough it is well known that so many contain this principle. I have\r\ninserted the following, as being known to contain the different colours\r\nmentioned; but there are many other plants equally productive of this\r\nprinciple that remain quite unnoticed at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n539. ACANTHUS mollis. BEAR'S-BREECH.--This gives a fine yellow, which\r\nwas in use among the ancients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n540. ACTAEA spicata. BANEBERRY.--The juice of the berries affords a deep\r\nblack, and is fixed with alum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n541. ANCHUSA officinalis. YELLOW ANCHUSA, or BLUE-FLOWERED BUGLOSS.--The\r\njuice of the corolla gives out to acids a beautiful green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n542. ANTHEMIS tinctoria.--The flowers afford a shining yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n543. ANTHYLLIS vulneraria. KIDNEY-VETCH.--The whole plant gives out a\r\nyellow, which is in use for colouring the garments of the country-\r\npeople.--Linn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n544. ARBUTUS uva-ursi. BEAR'S-BERRY.--The leaves boiled in an acid will\r\ndye a brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n545. ASPERULA tinctoria. WOODROOF.--The roots give a red similar to\r\nmadder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n546. ANEMONE Pulsatilla. PASQUE-FLOWER.--The corolla, a green tincture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n547. ARUNDO Phragmites. COMMON REED-GRASS.--The pamicle, a green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n548. BERBERIS vulgaris. BARBERRIES.--The inner bark, a yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n549. BROMUS secalinus. BROME-GRASS.--The panicle, a green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n550. BIDENS tripartita.

CONFERVA.--This green thready substance has the power of rendering\r\nfoetid water sweet; for which purpose, when water is scarce, it is\r\nusually put into water-tubs and reservoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n607. CORYLUS Avellana. HAZEL NUT.--The young shoots of hazel put into\r\ncasks with scalding water, render them sweet if they are musty, or\r\ncontain any bad flavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n608. CROCUS vernus. SPRING CROCUS.--Is well kown as a spring flower,\r\nproducing one of the most cheerful ornaments to the flower-garden early\r\nin the spring. It affords a great variety in point of beauty and colour,\r\nand is an article of considerable trade among the Dutch gardeners, who\r\ncultivate a great number of varieties, which every year are imported\r\ninto this and other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n609. EQUISETUM hyemale. DUTCH RUSH.--Of this article great quantities\r\nare brought from Holland for the purpose of polishing mahogany.

GALIUM verum. YELLOW LADIES' BEDSTRAW.--The foliage affords the\r\ndairy-maid a fine rennet for making cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIII.--POISONOUS PLANTS GROWING IN GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have found it necessary to be particular in my description of the\r\narticles in this section, as I find that, although the knowledge of\r\nBotany has in some measure increased, yet, in general, we are not better\r\nacquainted with the Poisonous Vegetables than we were thirty years ago.\r\nMany and frequent are the accidents which occur in consequence of\r\nmistakes being made with those plants; but it in general happens that,\r\nfrom feelings easily appreciated, persons do not like to detail such\r\nmisfortunes; which not only hides the mischief, but prevents, in a great\r\nmeasure, the antidotes becoming so well known as for the good of society\r\nwe could wish they were. This I experienced in my researches after\r\nseveral facts which I wished to ascertain regarding this subject.\r\nHowever, whilst we have in common use such plants as Foxglove, Hemlock,\r\nand Henbane, and which are now so generally sold in our herb-shops,\r\npeople who sell them ought to be particularly careful not to let such\r\nfall into the hands of ignorant persons, and thereby be administered\r\neither in mistake or in improper quantities. Our druggists and\r\napothecaries are careful in not selling to strangers the more common\r\npreparations of Mercury, or Arsenic, drugs which in themselves carry\r\nfear and dismay in their very names; yet we can get any poisonous\r\nvegetables either in the common market, or of herb-dealers, which are\r\nmore likely to be abused in their application than other poisons which\r\nare of not more dangerous tendencies.\r\n\r\nThe effects of Vegetable Poisons on the human frame vary according to\r\ncircumstances. The most usual are: that of disturbing the nervous\r\nfunction, producing vertigo, faintness, delirium, madness, stupor, or\r\napoplexy, with a consequent loss of understanding, of speech, and of all\r\nthe senses; and, frequently, this dreadful scene ends in death in a\r\nshort period.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, fortunate that these dangerous plants, which either grow\r\nwild, or are cultivated in this country, are few in number; and it is\r\nnot less so, that the most virulent often carry with them their own\r\nantidote, as many of them, from their disagreeable taste, produce nausea\r\nand sickness, by which their mischief is frequently removed; and when\r\nthis is not the case, it points out that the best and most effectual one\r\nis the application of emetics: and it may be almost considered a divine\r\ndispensation, that a plant, very common in all watery places, should be\r\nready at hand, which has from experience proved one of the most active\r\ndrugs of this nature, and this is the Ranunculus Flammula, Water-\r\nSpearwort. The juice of this plant, in cases of such emergency, may be\r\ngiven in the quantity of a table-spoonful, and repeated every three\r\nminutes until it operates, which it usually will do before the third is\r\ntaken into the stomach.\r\n\r\nAfter the vomiting is over, the effects often remain, by part of the\r\ndeleterious qualities being absorbed by the stomach; and as it often\r\nhappens, in such cases, that medical assistance may not be at hand, I\r\nshall, under the head of each class, give their proper antidote, which\r\nshould be in all cases applied as soon as possible, even before medical\r\nassistance is procured. And it should not be forgotten that, in dreadful\r\ncases where the medicine cannot be forced down through the usual\r\nchannel, recourse should be had to the use of clysters.\r\n\r\nUnder each of the following heads I shall describe such cases as have\r\ncome under my notice; as they may be useful for comparison: and shall\r\nput under each of the more dangerous the Plantae affines, describing as\r\naccurately as possible the differences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBITTER NAUSEOUS POISONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are much altered by vegetable acids in general, and especially by\r\noxymuriatic acid; but they still retain much of their poisonous quality,\r\nwhich appears to be rendered more active by alkalies. The tanning\r\ndecoctions of nut-galls, acacia, and other strong astringents, Venice\r\ntreacle, wine, spiritous liquors, and spices, are useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n623. CHELIDONIUM majus. CELANDINE.--The yellow juice of this plant is\r\nextremely acrid and narcotic. It is not at all like any plant used for\r\nculinary purposes, and therefore there is not any great danger likely to\r\narise from its being confounded with any useful vegetable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n624. CICUTA virosa. COWBANE.--Two boys and six girls, who found some\r\nroots of this plant in a water-meadow, ate of them. The two boys were\r\nsoon seized with pain of the pericardia, loss of speech, abolition of\r\nall the senses, and terrible convulsions. The mouth closely shut, so\r\nthat it could not be opened by any means. Blood was forced from the\r\nears, and the eyes were horribly distorted.\r\n\r\nBoth the boys died in half an hour from the first accession of the\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nThe six girls, who had taken a smaller quantity of the roots than the\r\nboys, were likewise seized with epileptic symptoms; but in the interval\r\nof the paroxysms, some Venice-treacle dissolved in vinegar was given to\r\nthem; in consequence of which they vomited, and recovered: but one of\r\nthem had a very narrow escape for her life. She lay nine hours with her\r\nhands and feet outstretched, and cold: all this time she had a\r\ncadaverous countenance, and her respiration could scarcely be perceived.\r\nWhen she recovered, she complained a long time of a pain in her stomach,\r\nand was unable to eat any food, her tongue being much wounded by her\r\nteeth in the convulsive fits.\r\n\r\nPlantae affines.\r\n\r\nCelery is smaller than this plant.\r\n\r\nParsley is also smaller in all its parts.\r\n\r\nAlexanders differs from it, as a plant not of so high growth.\r\n\r\nAngelica may be mistaken for this, but has a more agreeable scent.\r\n\r\nAll the water parsneps may be confounded with it: but these are known by\r\nthe smallness of the umbels; and they are generally in bloom, so that\r\nthis circumstance is a good criterion.\r\n\r\nCare should at all times be taken, not to make use of any umbelliferous\r\nplants growing in water, as many of them are, if not altogether\r\npoisonous, very unwholesome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n625. COLCHICUM autumnale. MEADOW-SAFFRON.--Baron Stoerch asserts, that\r\non cutting the fresh root into slices, the acrid particles emitted from\r\nit irritated the nostrils, fauces, and breast; and that the ends of the\r\nfingers with which it had been held became for a time benumbed; that\r\neven a single grain in a crumb of bread taken internally produced a\r\nburning heat and pain in the stomach and bowels, urgent strangury,\r\ntenesmus, colic pais, cephalalgia, hiccup, &c. From this relation, it\r\nwill not appear surprising that we find several instances recorded, in\r\nwhich the Colchicumproved a fatal poison both to man, and brute animals.\r\nTwo boys, after eating this plant, which they found growing in a meadow,\r\ndied in great agony. Violent symptoms have been produced by taking the\r\nflowers. The seeds, likewise, have been known to produce similar\r\neffects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n626. OENANTHE crocata. HEMLOCK. WATER DROPWORT.--Eleven French prisoners\r\nhad the liberty of walking in and about the town of Pembroke; three of\r\nthem being in the fields a little before noon, found and dug up a large\r\nquantity of this plant with its roots, which they took to be wild\r\ncelery, to eat with their bread and butter for dinner. After washing it\r\na while in the fields they all three ate, or rather tasted of the roots.\r\n\r\nAs they were entering the town, without any previous notice of sickness\r\nat the stomach or disorder in the head, one of them was seized with\r\nconvulsions. The other two ran home, and sent a surgeon to him. The\r\nsurgeon first endeavoured to bleed, and then to vomit him; but those\r\nendeavours were fruitless, and the soldier died in a very short time.\r\n\r\nIgnorant yet of the cause of their comrade's death, and of their own\r\ndanger, they gave of these roots to the other eight prisoners, who all\r\nate some of them with their dinner: the quantity could not be\r\nascertained. A few minutes after, the remaining two who gathered the\r\nplant were seized in the same manner as the first; of which one died:\r\nthe other was bled, and a vomit forced down, on account of his jaws\r\nbeing as it were locked together. This operated, and he recovered; but\r\nhe was for some time affected with a giddiness in his head; and it is\r\nremarkable, that he was neither sick nor in the least disordered in his\r\nstomach. The others being bled and vomited immediately, were secured\r\nfrom the approach of any bad symptoms. Upon examination of the plant\r\nwhich the French prisoners mistook for wild celery, Mr. Howell discovered\r\nit to be this plant, which grows very plentifully in the neighbourhood\r\nof Haverfordwest.\r\n\r\nAlthough the above account, which Mr. Wilmer has so minutely described,\r\nseems well attested, and corroborated by the above gentleman, yet I was\r\ninformed by the late Mr. Adams, comptroller of the Customs at Pembroke,\r\nthat the Oenanthe does not, that he could find, grow in that part of the\r\ncountry; but that what the above unfortunate French officers did\r\nactually eat was the wild Celery, which grows plentifully in all the wet\r\nplaces near that town. I take the liberty of mentioning this\r\ncircumstance; as it will serve to keep in mind the fact, that celery,\r\nwhen found wild, and growing in wet places, shold be used cautiously, it\r\nbeing in such situations of a pernicious tendency. For such whose\r\ncuriosity may lead them to become acquainted with the Oenanthe crocata,\r\nit grows in plenty near the Red House in Battersea fields on the Thames'\r\nbank. The water-courses on the marsh at Northfleet have great quantities\r\nof the Apium graveolens growing in them.\r\n\r\nPlantae affines.\r\n\r\nCultivated celery differs from it when young, first in the shape and\r\nsize of its roots. The Oenanthe is perennial, and has a large root, which\r\non being cut is observed to be full of juice, which exudes in form of\r\nglobules. The celery, on the contrary, has roots in general much\r\nsmaller, particularly when in a wild state.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of celery have somewhat the same flavour, but are smaller;\r\nthe nerves on the lobes of the leaves are also very prominent, and\r\nsomewhat more pointed.\r\n\r\nWhen the two plants are in bloom, a more conspicuous difference is\r\napparent in the involucrum and seeds, the character of which should be\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\nIt may be mistaken for Parsley; but it is both much larger in foliage\r\nand higher in growth; it is also different from it in the shape of the\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nThese are the two plants most likely to be confounded with it. But the\r\nstudent should also consult the difference existing between this plant\r\nand the following, which, although somewhat alike in appearance, may be\r\nconfounded.\r\n\r\nAngelica.\r\n\r\nChervil.\r\n\r\nAlexanders.\r\n\r\nHemlock.\r\n\r\nSkirret.\r\n\r\nCow Parsley.\r\n\r\nLovage.\r\n\r\nWild Parsnep.\r\n\r\nFool's Parsley.\r\n\r\nHamburgh Parsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n627. PRUNUS Lauro-cerasus. THE COMON LAUREL.--The leaves of the laurel\r\nhave a bitter taste, with a flavour resembling that of the kernels of\r\nthe peach or apricot; they communicate an agreeable flavour to aqueous\r\nand spirituous fluids, either by infusion or distillation. The distilled\r\nwater applied to the organs of smelling strongly impresses the mind with\r\nthe same ideas as arise from the taste of peach blossoms or apricot\r\nkernels: it is so extremely deleterious in its nature, and sometimes so\r\nsudden in its operation, as to occasion instantaneous death; but it more\r\nfrequently happens that epileptic symptoms are first produced. This\r\npoison was discovered by accident in Ireland in the year 1728: before\r\nwhich, it was no uncommon practice there, to add a certain quantity of\r\nlaurel water to brandy, or other spirituous liquors, to render them\r\nagreeable to the palate. At that time three women drank some\r\nlaurel-water; and one of them a short time afterwards became violently\r\ndisordered, lost her speech, and died in about an hour.\r\n\r\nA gentleman at Guildford, some few years back, also, by making an\r\nexperiment as he intended on himself, was poisoned by a small dose: he\r\ndid not survive the taking it more than two hours.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the above poisonous principle existing in the laurel,\r\nit has been recommended to persons to be cautious hwo they make use of\r\nthe leaves of that shrub, which is a usual practice with cooks for\r\ngiving flavour to custards, blanch-mange, and other made-dishes, lest\r\nthe narcotic principle should be also conveyed, to the detriment of the\r\nhealth of persons who eat of them.\r\n\r\nAnd the same may be said of the kernels of all stone-fruits; for the\r\nflavours given to noyau, ratafia, and other liquors which are highly\r\nprized by epicures, are all of them derived from the same principle as\r\nlaurel-water, and which, on chemical investigation, is found to be\r\nprussic acid. This exists in considerable quantities in the bitter\r\nalmond, and which when separated proves to be the most active poison\r\nknown, to the human as well as all other animal existence. This\r\nprinciple, and its mode of extraction, should not be made more public\r\nthan the necessity of scientific research requires. We cannot with\r\npropriety accuse either this tree or the laurel as being poisonous,\r\nbecause the ingenuity of mankind has found out a mode of extracting this\r\nactive acidulous principle, and which is so very small in proportion to\r\nthe wholesome properties of the fruit, as not to be suspected of any\r\ndanger but for this discovery. As well might we accuse wheat of being\r\npoisonous, because it yields on distillation brandy, which has been\r\nknown to kill many a strong-bodied fellow who has indulged in this\r\nfavourite beverage to excess. An eminent chemist informs me, that he has\r\nmade experiments with the oxalic acid, and found that when this was also\r\nconcentrated, it has similar effects; insomuch that no animal can\r\ncontain a grain of it if taken into the throat or stomach: and thus\r\nmight we also be led to consider the elegant, and in itself harmless,\r\nwood-sorrel, as a poisonous plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACRID POISONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese should be attacked by strong decoctions of oak-bark, gall-nuts,\r\nand Peruvian bark; after which soft mucilaginous matters should be used,\r\nas milk, fat broth, or emulsions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n628. ACONITUM Napelhus. BLUE MONKSHOOD.--This is a very poisonous plant;\r\nand many instances have been adduced of its dangerous effects.\r\n\r\nIt has probably obtained the name of Wolfsbane, from a tradition that\r\nwolves, in searching for particular roots which they in part subsist\r\nupon in winter, frequently make a mistake, and eat of this plant, which\r\nproves fatal to them.\r\n\r\nA weaver in Spitalfields, having supped upon some cold meat and salad,\r\nwas suddenly taken ill; and when the surgeon employed upon this\r\nocccasion visited him, he found him in the following situation:--\"He was\r\nin bed, with his head supported by an assistant, his eyes and teeth were\r\nfixed, his nostrils compressed, his hands, feet, and forehead cold, no\r\npulse to be perceived, his respiration short, interrupted, and\r\nlaborious.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after he had eaten of the above, he complained of a sensation of\r\nheat affecting the tongue and fauces; his teeth appeared loose; and it\r\nwas very remarkable, although a looking-glass was produced, and his\r\nfriends attempted to reason him out of the extravagant idea, yet he\r\nimagined that his face was swelled to twice its usual size. By degrees\r\nthe heat, wich at first only seemed to affect the mouth and adjacent\r\nparts, diffused itself over his body and extremities: he had an\r\nunsteadiness and lassitue in his joints, particularly of the knees and\r\nancles, with an irritable twitching of the tendons, which seemed to\r\ndeprive him of the power of walking; and he thought that in all his\r\nlimbs he perceived an evident interruption to the circulation of the\r\nblood. A giddiness was the next symptom, which was not accompanied with\r\nnausea. His eyes became watery, and he could not see distinctly; a kind\r\nof humming noise in his ears continually disturbed him, until he was\r\nreduced to the state of insensibility before described.\r\n\r\nPlantae affines.\r\n\r\nAlthough the mischief which is recited above occurred from the root\r\nhaving been purchased at market, I do not know of any vegetable in\r\ncommon use likely to be confounded with this. It might by chance be\r\nmistaken for the smaller tubers of Jerusalem artichoke.\r\n\r\nIn foliage it comes near to the other species of Aconitum, and to the\r\nperennial Larkspurs.\r\n\r\nHowever, as this is a plant much grown in pleasure-grounds on account of\r\nits beautiful blue flowers, great care should be taken not to use any\r\nroots taken from such places that cannot be well ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n629. ACONITUM Lycoctonum. YELLOW WOLFSBANE.--Every part of this plant is\r\naccounted poisonous. In fact, I think it is proper that all the species\r\nshould be considered as such, and never be made use of, either in\r\nmedicine or otherwise, without great care in their administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n630. ACTAEA spicata. BANEBERRY.--This plant is also considered as a\r\ndeadly poison; but we have no authentical accounts of its mischievous\r\neffects, although Parkinson has mentioned it in these words:--\r\n\r\n\"The inhabitants of all the mountaines and places wheresoever it\r\ngroweth, as some writers say, do generally hold it to be a most\r\ndangerous and deadly poison, both to man and beast; and they used to\r\nkill the wolves herewith very speedily.\"\r\n\r\nThis is not a common plant, growing only in some particular situa-tions,\r\nas near Ingleborough in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n631. RHUS Toxicodendron. POISON-ASH.-The juice of the leaves of this\r\nplant is so very acrid as often to corrode the skin, if the leaves are\r\ngathered when the dew is on them. Great care should certainly be taken\r\nin the giving such a medicine internally, as also in its preparation, it\r\nbeing usually administered in a dried state.\r\n\r\nPlanta affinis.\r\n\r\nRhus radicans differs from this in having a more trailing habit of\r\ngrowth; otherwise it is scarcely different, so little so, as to baffle a\r\ndistinction being made by description alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUPEFYING POISONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe substances that deaden the effects of the poisons of this class are\r\nvegetable acids, which should be thrown into the stomach in large\r\nquantities. After the operation of emetics, cream of tartar is also\r\nconsidered of great use, as also oxymuriatic acid, infusions of\r\nnut-gall, oak bark; warm spices are considered also of use, for they may\r\nseparate some part of the deleterious matter, as is shown by their\r\neffect when mixed with decoction of these plants; acerb and astringent\r\nwines are also of great use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n632. AETHUSA Cynapium. FOOL'S PARSLEY.--Fool's Parsley seems generally\r\nallowed to be a plant which possesses poisonous qualities. Baron Haller\r\nhas taken a great deal of pains to collect what has been said concerning\r\nit, and quotes many authorities to show that this plant has been\r\nproductive of the most violent symptoms; such as anxiety, hiccough, and\r\na delirium even for the space of three months, stupor, vomiting,\r\nconvulsions, and death.\r\n\r\nWhere much parsley is used, the mistress of the house therefore would do\r\nwell to examine the herbs previous to their being made use of; but the\r\nbest precaution will be, always to sow that variety called Curled\r\nparsley, which cannot be mistaken for this or any other plant. We might\r\nalso observe, that the scent is strong and disagreeable in the aethusa:\r\nbut this property, either in the plant or the poison, is not at all\r\ntimes to be trusted in cases of this nature.\r\n\r\nPlantae affines.\r\n\r\nParsley. The lobes of the leaves are larger in this plant, and are not\r\nquite so deep a green. The leaves of fool's parsley are also finer\r\ncleft, and appear to end more in a short point.\r\n\r\nCelery, being much larger, cannot easily be confounded with it.\r\n\r\nChervil. Fool's parsley, when young, differs from this plant but very\r\nlittle, being much the same in size, and the laciniae of the leaves of a\r\nsimilar form. Chervil, however, is much lighter in colour, and the\r\nflavour more pleasant, both to the taste and smell.\r\n\r\nHemlock is commonly a larger plant; and, exclusive of the generic\r\ndistinctions, may be generally known by its spotted stalk.\r\n\r\nWhen fool's parsley is in bloom, it is readily known by the length of\r\nthe involucrum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n633. ATROPA Belladonna. DEADLY NIGHTSHADE.--Some boys and girls\r\nperceiving in a garden at Edinburgh the beautiful berries of the deadly\r\nnightshade, and unacquainted with their poisonous quality, ate several.\r\nIn a short time dangerous symptoms appeared; a swelling of the abdomen\r\ntook place; they became convulsed. The next morning one of them died,\r\nand another in the evening of the same day, although all possible care\r\nwas taken of them.\r\n\r\nAnother case is related by Dr. Lambert, who was desired to visit two\r\nchildren at Newburn, in Scotland, who the preceding day had swallowed\r\nsome of the berries of the deadly nightshade. He found them in a\r\ndeplorable situation. The eldest (ten years of age) was delirious in\r\nbed, and affected with convulsive spasms: the younger was not in a much\r\nbetter condition in his mother's arms. The eyes of both the children\r\nwere particularly affected. The whole circle of the cornea appeared\r\nblack, the iris being so much dilated as to leave no vestige of the\r\npupil. The tunica conjunctiva much inflamed. These appearances,\r\naccompanied with a remarkable kind of staring, exhibited a very\r\naffecting scene. The symptoms came on about two hours after they had\r\neaten the berries: they appeared at first as if they had been\r\nintoxicated, afterwards lost the power of speaking, and continued the\r\nwhole night so unruly, that it was with much difficulty they were kept\r\nin bed. Neither of these ever recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n634. DATURA Stramonium. THORN-APPLE.--The seeds and leaves of the\r\nthorn-apple received into the human stomach produce first a vertigo, and\r\nafterwards madness. If the quantity is large, and vomiting is not\r\noccasioned, it will undoubtedly prove fatal. Boerhaave informs us, that\r\nsome boys eating some seeds of the thorn-apple which were thrown out of\r\na garden, were seized with giddiness, horrible imaginations, terrors,\r\nand delirium. Those that did not soon vomit, died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n635. HYOSCYAMUS niger. HENBANE.--Henbane is a very dangerous poison. The\r\nseeds, leaves, and root, received into the human stomach, are all\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\nThe root in a superior degree produces sometimes madness; and if taken\r\nin large quantity, and the stomach does not reject it by vomiting, a\r\nstupor and apopleptic symptoms, terminating in death, are the usual\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nA case of the bad effects of the roots of this plant, which occurred in\r\nIreland, is mentioned by Dr. Threlkeld. In the winter season, some men\r\nworking in a garden threw up some roots which were supposed to be\r\nSkirrets, and those were cooked for dinner. About two hours after they\r\nwere eaten, a person who partook of them was taken with an unusual\r\nlassitude, as if being much fatigued, heat and dryness both in the mouth\r\nan the throat, a giddiness accompanied with dimness of sight, and a\r\npartial stoppage in his urine. Several others who had eaten at the same\r\ntable, as also servants who had partaken, were subjected to the like\r\ninfluence. Medical assistance being at hand, by the use of emetics they\r\nwere relieved; but it was many days before the whole of them had\r\nrecovered from those dreadful symptoms.\r\n\r\nTwo children having both eaten of the berries of this plant, the one a\r\nboy (who recovered) being taken ill, vomitted, and was supposed to have\r\nthrown them off his stomach: the other, a little girl, died in\r\nconvulsions the next morning. As mothers and kindred souls do not like\r\nnames to be made public in these cases, I cannot help feeling some\r\ndesire to suppress a publicity of a fact in which a near and dear\r\nrelative was materially interested. In justice, however, to the public,\r\nI must mention that I can vouch for the fact, and trust it may not pass\r\nwithout notice, so far as to let the berries be supposed anything but\r\nwholesome.\r\n\r\nPlantae affines.\r\n\r\nThe idea of Skirrets being confounded with this plant, is, I think,\r\nerroneous, if it has leaves on, as they are not pinnated, and very\r\ndifferent from it. When the Hyoscyamus is in bloom, it has\r\ncuriously-formed flowers of an uncommonly disgusting hue. The scent of\r\nthis plant, on bruising it, and its general appearance, render it almost\r\nimpossible that any one should mistake it. The roots, in the winter\r\nseason, when destitute of leaves, may, however, be mistaken for those of\r\nParsnep, Parsley, Skirret, and many others of similar shape, and of\r\nwhich it is out of our power to give a distinguishing character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n636. LACTUCA virosa. STRONG-SCENTED WILD LETTUCE.--The juice of this\r\nplant is a very powerful opiate, and care should be taken how it is made\r\nuse of. I have not heard of any dangerous effects having been produced\r\nby it. The strong and disagreeable scent and bitter nauseous taste will\r\nmost likely always operate as a preservative to its being used for food;\r\nand as a medicine, it is hoped its use will be confined to the judicious\r\nhand of a medical botanist.\r\n\r\nPlantae affines.\r\n\r\nAll the kinds of garden lettuce; but it may be distinguished by its\r\nspines on the back of the leaves. It may be remarked, that the milky\r\njuice of all lettuce has similar properties to the above; but the juice\r\nis not milky till such time as the plant produces seed-stalks, and then\r\nthe taste in general is too nauseous for it to be eaten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n637. SOLANUM Dulcamara. BITTERSWEET.--The berries of this plant have\r\nbeen sometimes eaten by children, and have produced very alarming\r\neffects. It is common in hedges, and should be at all times as much\r\nextirpated as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n638. SOLANUM nigrum. DEADLY NIGHTSHADE.--Webfer has given us an account\r\nof some children that were killed in consequence of having eaten the\r\nberries of this plant for black currants. And others have spoken of the\r\ndireful effects of the whole plant so much, that, from the incontestable\r\nproofs of its deleterious qualities, persons cannot be too nice in\r\nselecting their pot-herbs, particularly those who make a practice of\r\ngathering from dunghills and gardens Fat-Hen, &c. as there is some\r\ndistant similitude betwixt these plants, and their places of growth are\r\nthe same.--Curtis's Fl. Lond. fasc. 2.\r\n\r\nPlantae affines.\r\n\r\nAll the Chenopodia grow with this plant wild, and are somewhat alike in\r\nappearance; but the Solanum may at all times be distinguished by its\r\ndisagreeable strong scent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOETID POISONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese come near to the Stupefying Poisons; but they are not treated in\r\nthe same manner; for ether, wine, or acids combined with spirits, appear\r\nthe properest things to destroy their deleterious properties: spices are\r\nthen indicated, except for savine, which requires instead thereof acids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n639. CONIUM maculatum. HEMLOCK.--Two soldiers quartered at Waltham Abbey\r\ncollected in the fields adjoining to that town a quantity of herbs\r\nsufficient for themselves and two others for dinner when boiled with\r\nbacon. These herbs were accordingly dressed, and the poor men ate of the\r\nbroth with bread, and afterwards the herbs with bacon: in a short time\r\nthey were all seized with vertigo. Soon after they were comatose, two of\r\nthem became convulsed, and died in about three hours.\r\n\r\nPlantae affines.\r\n\r\nParsley differs from this except in size and colour of the leaves.\r\n\r\nCelery is also much like this plant, and particularly so if found wild;\r\nbut which, for reasons given before, should never be collected to be\r\neaten.\r\n\r\nFool's parsley is very like it; and when the hemlock is in a small\r\nstate, and this plant luxuriant, I have been in some doubt as to\r\npointing out a perfect difference, especially when they are not in\r\nfructification. The spots on hemlock form generally a distinguishing\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n640. DIGITALIS purpurea. FOXGLOVE.--A few months ago, a child was ill of\r\na pulmonary complaint, and the apothecary had desired the nurse to\r\nprocure a small quantity of Coltsfoot and make it a little tea; and\r\naccordingly the good woman went to a shop in London, where she procured,\r\nas she supposed, three pennyworth of that herb, and made a decoction, of\r\nwhich she gave the patient a tea-cupful; a few minutes after which she\r\nfound symptoms of convulsions make their appearance, and sent for the\r\napothecary: but who, unfortunately, was so totally ignorant of botany as\r\nnot to know the plant, but supposing it to be Coltsfoot, after the\r\ninfant died, took his leave, without ay remark further, than that the\r\ndisorder which occasioned its death had arisen from some accidental and\r\nunusual cause. The nurse, however, did not feel perfectly satisfied of\r\nthis fact, and carried the remainder of the herb to Apothecaries-Hall;\r\nand having applied there for information, was referred to Mr. Leffler, a\r\ngentleman who had from his botanical researches that season obtained the\r\nSloanean prize; who told her the mistake. He also went and saw the body,\r\nand investigated the whole case in a way that has done that young\r\ngentleman great credit; and from him I have been favoured with this\r\naccount. Had the medical attendant but known the difference between the\r\ntwo plants when he was called in first, there was a chance of the child\r\nbeing saved to its distressed parents. And here was certainly a striking\r\ninstance of medical men neglecting so far the study of botany, as not to\r\nknow one of the most useful as well as one of the most dangerous plants\r\nof the present Pharmacopoeia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n641. HELLEBORUS foetidus. BEARSFOOT.--The country-people are in the habit\r\nof chopping up the leaves of this plant and giving it to children for\r\nremoving worms; but it is a dangerous medicine, and should be made use\r\nof with great caution. It is also recommended as a medicine for the same\r\npurpose in horses. As much of the chopped leaves as will lie on a\r\ncrown-piece, given amongst a feed of corn for three days, and remitted\r\nthree days, and repeated thus for nine doses, has been known to remove\r\nthis disease.\r\n\r\n\"I heard a melancholy story of a mother in this city; viz. that a\r\nCountry Colleagh gave some of this plant to her two sons, one of six,\r\nthe other of four years of age, to kill worms; and that before four in\r\nthe afternoon they were both corpses.\"-Dr. Threlkeld, in a short account\r\nof the plants in the neighbourhood of Dublin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n642. JUNIPERUS Salvina. SAVINE.--The expressed juice of this plant is\r\nvery poisonous, and often known to produce the most violent effects. It\r\nis sometimes used by persons for expelling worms in children, but should\r\nbe used with great caution; for, if the quantity taken into the stomach\r\nis more than it can digest, all the dreadful effects of the poisons of\r\nthis class are certain to be the immediate consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n643. SCROPHULARIA aquatica. WATER-BETONY.--Every part of this plant is\r\nsaid to be violently narcotic; but its very disagreeable strong scent\r\nand extremely bitter taste render it not likely to be used in mistake\r\nfor any culinary vegetable; and although we know what its effects are\r\nfrom report, we do not think it of so dangerous a tendency as some of\r\nour poisonous vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRASTIC POISONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese purge both upwards and downwards with great violence by means of\r\ntheir acrid poisonous resin, which also violently affects the throat and\r\npassages. Although alkalies have been recommended in this case, in order\r\nto divide this resin, and that a solution of soap is proper, yet the\r\nvegetable acids are also very useful, and have a great effect in\r\ndiminishing the purgative effect. Besides this, it appears still more\r\nadvantageous to give astringents: Venice treacle, decoctions of bark or\r\ncascarilla, pomegranate rind, and balaustines; all which certainly\r\nprecipitate this drastic principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n644. ASCLEPIAS syriaca. SYRIAN DOGSBANE.--All the species of Asclepias\r\nhave a white acrid juice which is considered poisonous. It is observed\r\nto be very acrid when applied to any sensible part of the mouth or\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n645. BRYONIA alba. WILD VINE, or WHITE BRYONY.--The berries of this\r\nplant, when hanging on the hedges, have the appearance of white grapes,\r\nand have been eaten by children. They are known to produce dreadful\r\neffects; but it frequently happens that they produce nausea on the\r\nstomach, by which they operate as an emetic of themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n646. EUPHORBIA Lathyris. CAPER SPURGE.--A plant common in old gardens,\r\nbut not indigenous. The seed-vessels are much in shape of caper-buds:\r\nhence its name. People have been in the habit of pickling these berries,\r\nfrom which some dangerous symptoms have arisen; it is probable that the\r\nvinegar may have been the means of checking its bad effects. It should,\r\nhowever, never be used as food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n647. EUPHORBIA amygdaloides. WOOD SPURGE.--The juice of this plant has\r\nbeen known to produce very dangerous swellings in the mouth and throat\r\nof persons who have occasionally put it into their mouths. We do not\r\nknow that it is very dangerous; and nothing is likely to tempt any\r\npersons to use it as food or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n648. MERCURIALIS perennis. DOG'S MERCURY.--This plant is of a soporific\r\ndeleterious nature, and is said to be noxious to both man and beast.\r\nMany instances are recorded of its fatal effects.\r\n\r\nMr. Ray acquaints us with the case of a man, his wife, and three\r\nchildren, who were poisoned by eating it fried with bacon: and a\r\nmelancholy instance is related in the Philosophical Transactions, Number\r\nCCIII., of its pernicious effects upon a family who ate at supper the\r\nherb boiled and fried. It produced at first nausea and vomiting, and\r\ncomatose symptoms afterwards; two of the children slept twenty-four\r\nhours; when they awoke, they vomited again, and recovered. The other\r\ngirl could not be awakened during four days; at the expiration of which\r\ntime she opened her eyes and expired.\r\n\r\nPlantae affines.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the different species of Chenopodium have been mistaken\r\nfor this plant. I do not see myself any very near likeness: but as all\r\nthe species of Chenopodium have been called English Mercury, it is\r\npossible that the name may have been the cause of the mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n649. MERCURIALIS annua. ANNUAL DOG'S MERCURY.--Persons who are in the\r\nhabit of gathering wild herbs to cook, should be careful of this. It\r\ngrows plentifully in all rich grounds, and is common with Fat Hen and\r\nthe other herbs usually collected for such purposes in the spring, and\r\nfrom which it is not readily distinguished: at least, I cannot describe\r\na difference that a person ignorant of botany can distinguish it by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n650. PERIPLOCA graeca.--This is an ornamental creeping plant, and\r\ncommonly grown in gardens for covering verandas, and other places for\r\nshade.\r\n\r\nI once witnessed a distressing case. A nurse walking in a garden\r\ngathered flower of this plant, and gave it to a child which she had in\r\nher arms. The infant having put it to its mouth, it caused a\r\nconsiderable swelling and inflammation, which came on so suddenly, that,\r\nhad it not been that one of the labourers had met with a similar\r\naccident, no one would have known the cause. The child was several days\r\nbefore it was out of danger, as the inflammation had reached the throat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n651. VERATRUM album. WHITE HELLEBORE.--The roots of this plant, and also\r\nof the Veratrum nigrum, have been imported mixed with the roots of\r\nyellow gentian, and have proved poisonous.--Lewis's Materia Medica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONOUS FUNGI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe deleterious effects of these generally show themselves soon after\r\nthey are in the stomach. Vomiting should be immediately excited, and\r\nthen the vegetable acids should be given; either vinegar, lemon-juice,\r\nor that of apples; after which, give ether and antispasmodic remedies,\r\nto stop the excessive bilious vomiting. Infusions of gall-nut, oak-bark,\r\nand Peruvian bark, are recommended as capable of neutralizing the\r\npoisonous principle of mushrooms. It is however the safest way not to\r\neat any of these plants until they have been soaked in vinegar. Spirit\r\nof wine, and ether, extract some part of their poison; and tanning\r\nmatter decomposes the greatest part of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgaricus bulbosus.\r\n-------- necator.\r\n-------- mamosus.\r\n-------- piperitus.\r\n-------- campanulatus.\r\n-------- muscarius.\r\n\r\nThese are kown to be poisonous. But the fungi should all be used with\r\ngreat caution; for I believe even the Champignon and Edible mushroom to\r\npossess deleterious qualities when grown in certain places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIV.--PLANTS NOXIOUS TO CATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing lists of poisonous plants are most of them of less\r\ndangerous tendency to cattle than to the human species: for although\r\nmany of them may be mistaken for wholesome, yet, when they are growing\r\nwild, it will be observed, that the discriminating powers of the brute\r\ncreation in this point are so correct, that very few have been known to\r\nbe eaten by them.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few of a different class, which, as not containing\r\nany thing particularly disagreeable to the taste of cattle, are\r\nfrequently eaten by them to their injury.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural student should make himself perfectly acquainted with\r\nthose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n652. CICUTA virosa. COWBANE.--Linnaeus observes, that cattle have died in\r\nconsequence of eating the roots. It is fortunate that this plant is not\r\nvery plentiful: it is poisonous to all kinds of cattle except goats. The\r\nflower of this plant is not unlike that of water-parsneps, which cows at\r\nsome seasons will eat great quantities of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n653. BEAR'S GARLICK. Allium ursinum.\r\n\r\n654. CROW GARLICK. Allium vineale.\r\n\r\nThese plants very frequently occur in meadow-land, and have property of\r\ngiving a strong garlick flavour to the milk yielded by cows that feed\r\nthere; and which is often also communicated to the butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n655. DARNELL GRASS. Lolium temulentum.--This grass has the faculty of\r\ncausing poultry or birds to become intoxicated, and so much so that it\r\ncauses their death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n656. LOUSEWORT. Pedicularis palustris.--This plant, which abounds in wet\r\nmeadows, is said to produce a lousy disease in cows if they eat of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n657. MAYWEED. Anthemis cotula.--This is altogether of such an acrid\r\nnature, that the hands of persons employed in weeding crops and reaping,\r\nare often so blistered and corroded as to prevent their working. It also\r\nhas been known to blister the mouths and nostrils of cattle when feeding\r\nwhere it grows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n658. COLCHICUM autumnale. MEADOW-SAFFRON.--This is a common plant in\r\npasture-land in Worcestershire, Herefordshire, and other counties. Many\r\nare the instances that have occurred of the bad effects of it to cattle.\r\nI have this last autumn known several cows that died in consequence of\r\neating this plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n659. MELILOT. Trifolium officinale.--This plant when eaten by cows\r\ncommunicates a disagreeable taste to milk and butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n660. ROUND-LEAVED SUN-DEW. Drosera rotundifolia.--Very common on marshy\r\ncommons, and is said to be poisonous to sheep, and to give them the\r\ndisease called the rot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n661. SEA BARLEY-GRASS. Hordeum maritimum.--This grass has been known in\r\nthe Isle of Thanet and other places to produce a disease in the mouths\r\nof horses, by the panicles of the grass penetrating the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n662. WATER-HEMLOCK. Phellandrium aquaticum.--Linnaeus informs us that the\r\nhorses in Sweden by eating of this plant are seized with a kind of\r\npalsy, which he supposes is brought upon them, not so much by any\r\nnoxious qualities in the plant itself, as by a certain insect which\r\nbreeds in the stalks, called by him for that reason Curculio\r\nparaplecticus [Syst. Nat. 510]. The Swedes give swine's dung for the\r\ncure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n663. YEW. Taxus baccata.--This is poisonous to cattle: farmers and other\r\npersons should be careful of this being thrown where sheep or cattle\r\nfeed in snowy weather. It is particularly dangerous to deer, for they\r\nwill eat of it with avidity when it comes in their way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XV.--PLANTS NOXIOUS IN AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnual Weeds, or such as grow wild in Fields, and that do not produce\r\nany Food for Cattle.\r\n\r\nMany weeds are troublesome to the farmer amongst his crops; but which,\r\nby affording a little fodder at some season or other, in some degree\r\ncompensate for their intrusion. But as the following are not of this\r\ndescription, they ought at all times to be extirpated: for it should be\r\nrecollected, that the space occupied by such a plant would, in many\r\ninstances, afford room for many ears of wheat, &c.\r\n\r\nThe following are annuals, and chiefly grow among arable crops, as corn,\r\n&c. As these every year spring up from seeds, it is a very difficult\r\nmatter for the farmer to prevent their increase, especially since the\r\npractice of fallowing land has become almost obsolete. It is a fact\r\nworthy notice, that the seeds of most of the annual weeds will lie in\r\nthe ground for many years, if they happen to be place deep: so that all\r\nland is more or less impregnated with them, and a fresh supply is\r\nproduced every time the land is ploughed. It is therefore proper that\r\nannual weeds of every description should be prevented as much as\r\npossible can be from going to seed, for one year's crop will take\r\nseveral seasons to eradicate. The only effectual mode we are acquainted\r\nwith of getting rid of annual weeds is, either by hoeing them up when\r\nyoung, or by cutting the plants over with any instrument whilst in\r\nbloom; for it should be observed, that those never spring from the roots\r\nif cut over at that period of their growth, which oftentimes may be\r\neasily accomplished.\r\n\r\nI once observed a crop of burnet, in which Bromus secalius (Lob Grass)\r\nwas growing, whose spike stood a considerable height above the crop, and\r\nseveral acres of which a boy or woman might have cut over in a short\r\nspace of time: but it was not so: the grass seeds and burnet were\r\nsuffered to ripen together, and no means could be devised to separate\r\nthe two when threshed. For this reason the burnet seeds never could find\r\na market, and consequently the trouble of saving it, as well as the\r\ncrop, was lost to the grower. I mention this as an instance of many that\r\nfrequently occur. How many times do we see with crops of winter tares\r\nwild oats seeding in them? or Carduus mutans standing so high above\r\nthose crops that they might be thus extirpated with great ease?\r\n\r\nIt may be observed, that it is in culture of this nature where annual\r\nseeds multiply. A regular crop of wheat will, by its thickness on the\r\nground, retard their growth by smothering them; but the other gives them\r\nevery facility, and particularly autumnal-sown crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n664.

It unfortunately appens that, where the land is the most\r\nworked, and the roots the more broken thereby, the more the crop of\r\nweeds increases on the land. Therefore, the only effectual mode of\r\nextirpating plants of this nature, is by picking out the roots after the\r\nplough, or by digging them up at every opportunity by some proper\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nWhere weeds of this nature occur, there is too often thought to be more\r\nlabour than profit in their extirpation. And although this is an\r\nargument of some propriety, where a farmer is tenant at will, or where\r\nhis strength is not proportionate to the land: yet if land is worth any\r\nthing at all, that, whatever it may be, is lost, if it is suffered thus\r\nto become barren. And as prevention is in most cases considered\r\npreferable to cure, more care ought to be taken than generally is, of\r\nall our hedges and waste pieces of land by road sides, &c. Many of these\r\nplants are found growing in such places, and their seeds are of that\r\nnature that they are calculated to fly to considerable distances,--a\r\ncontrivance in nature to fertilize the ground in her own way; but which,\r\nas agriculturists, it is the business of men to check.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n706.

It varies in colour from yellow to\r\nbrown, and is commonly found in old pastures: it may also be remarked,\r\nthat where any perennial species of Clover (Trifolium) are found wild,\r\nit is almost a certain indication of a fertile loam, and such as\r\ncontains the proper food of plants in abundance.\r\n\r\nBog-mould--is frequently found on waste lands, where Heaths (Ericae) are\r\nproduced: it is composed of decayed vegetable matter and white sand. The\r\nbest sort is light when dry, of a black colour, and easily reduced to\r\npowder. Care should be taken to distinguish it from Peat, which is hard\r\nwhen dry, destitute in a great measure of the sand, and mostly of a red\r\ncolour. This contains in great quantities sulphureous particles and\r\nmineral oil, which are known to be highly destructive to vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe mould formed from rotten leaves is a good substitute for bog-mould\r\nif mixed with sand, and is often made use of for the same purposes.\r\nThese earths should be dug from the surface to the depth of a few inches\r\nand laid in heaps, that the roots, &c. contained therein may be\r\ndecomposed: and before they are used should be passed through a coarse\r\nscreen, particularly if intended for plants in pots.\r\n\r\nAs loam has been found to contain the greatest portion of the real\r\npabulum of plants, it has long been used for such as are planted in\r\npots; and the component parts of bog-earth being of a light nature, a\r\nmixture of the two in proper proportions will form a compost in which\r\nmost kinds of plants will succeed. Attention should be paid to the\r\nconsistence of the loam; as the more stiff it is, the greater portion of\r\nthe other is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIANDRIA MONOGYNIA.\r\n\r\n1 JASMINUM officinale. w.

For this purpose I have retained a portion of the Umbelliferous\r\nand other plants. Although not to be distinguished for their general\r\nbeauty or appearance, yet they are calculated to afford the student the\r\nbest plants for comparison, and for that reason I have arranged them\r\naccording to the Linnaean System.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIANDRIA MONOGYNIA.\r\n\r\n 1 Veronica sibirica          Siberian Speedwell           c.m.\r\n 2 -------- virginica         Virginian ditto

ALISMA Plantago. I cannot pass over this beautiful aquatic without\r\ngiving it a place amongst the ornamental plants with which our country\r\nabounds. In pieces of water this is of considerable interest both as to\r\nflowers and foliage, and no place of the kind should ever be destitute\r\nof such a beauty. It is of easy culture; the plant taken from its place\r\nof growth and sunk into the water with a stone to keep it in its place,\r\nis a ready and easy mode of planting it, and there is no fear when once\r\nintroduced but it will succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ANDROMEDA polifolia. This is a beautiful little shrub, and grown in\r\ngardens for the sake of its flowers; it is also an evergreen. This plant\r\nwill not succeed unless it is planted in bog earth,--for a description\r\nof which see page 152 of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. AQUILEGIA vulgaris. COLUMBINE.--We have scarcely a plant affording\r\nmore beauty or greater variety than this. It is commonly, when found\r\nwild, of a blue colour, but when the seeds are sown in the garden a\r\nvariety of tints is produced. It is a perennial, but easily raised from\r\nseed, which should be sown in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. ANTHEMIS maritima. A double-flowering variety of this plant used to\r\nbe common in the gardens near London, but is now scarce: it is very\r\nbeautiful, and constantly in bloom during summer. It is propagated by\r\nplanting the roots in the spring and autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. ANTIRRHINUM linaria, v. Peloria.--I cannot pass over this singular\r\nand beautiful flower without notice. There is a fine figure of it in the\r\nFlora Londinensis: it is very ornamental, and the structure of the bloom\r\nis truly interesting. It is easily propagated by planting the roots in\r\nthe spring months, but it is not common.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. ANTIRRHINUM majus. SNAPDRAGON.--This is also a plant deserving the\r\nattention of the lover of flowers: it is capable of culture into many\r\nvery beautiful and interesting varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. BELLIS perennis. DAISY.--This plant affords us many very beautiful\r\nvarieties for the flower garden. The large Red Daisy and all the other\r\nfine kinds are only this plant improved by culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. BUTOMIS umbellatus. This is an aquatic, and well adapted to ornament\r\npieces of water. Its beautiful flowers in the summer months are inferior\r\nto scarcely any plants growing in such places, and its foliage will form\r\nprotection for any birds, &c., which are usually kept in such places. It\r\nis easily propagated by planting it in such places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. CALTHA palustris. MARSH MARIGOLD.--This fine yellow flower is also\r\nmade double by culture, and finds a place in the flower garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. CHEIRANTHUS fruticulosus. WALLFLOWER.--Is a plant possessing great\r\nbeauty, and very interesting on account of its fine scent. We have this\r\nplant also improved by culture, making many fine double varieties. It is\r\na biennial, and easily raised from seeds, which should be sown in June.\r\nThe double varieties are cultivated by cuttings of the branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11. CYPRIPEDIUM Calceolus. LADIES SLIPPER.--A flower of the most\r\nuncommon beauty, but is now become scarce; it is a native of the woods\r\nnear Skipton in Yorkshire, but has been so much sought for by the lovers\r\nof plants as to become almost extinct. It is difficult to propagate; but\r\nwhen the plants have been for some years growing, will admit of being\r\nparted, so that it may be increased in that way: it will not bear to be\r\noften removed, and should be left to grow in the same place for several\r\nyears without being disturbed. It succeeds best in bog earth or rotten\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12. DELPHINIUM Ajacis. LARKSPUR.--This is also an annual flower,\r\naffording a pleasing variety in the flower garden in the summer months.\r\nFor it culture, see p. 188.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13. DIANTHUS Caryophyllus. THE CARNATION.--All our fine varieties of the\r\ncarnation are the produce of this plant.\r\n\r\nThe common single variety produces seed in great abundance, but the\r\nimproved double varieties are sparing in produce: the fine kinds of this\r\nflower are reared by layers put down about the month of July; they may\r\nalso be propagated by cuttings, but the other is the most eligible and\r\ncertain mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14. EPILOBIUM angustifolium. A plant of singular ornament. There is also\r\na white variety of this found in gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15. ERICA vulgaris. There is now in cultivation in the gardens a\r\ndouble-flowering variety of this plant, which is highly interesting and\r\nof singular beauty. It grows readily in bog earth, and is raised by\r\nlayers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16. ERICA Daboeica. IRISH HEATH.--A plant of singular beauty and of easy\r\nculture; and being of small growth and almost constantly in bloom, has\r\nalso obtained a place in the shrubbery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17. FRITILLARIA Meleagris. A very ornamental bulbous plant, of which the\r\nDutch gardeners have many improved varieties, varying in the colour and\r\nsize of the blossoms: these are usually imported in August, and should\r\nbe immediately planted, as the bulbs will not keep long when out of\r\nground, unless they are covered with sand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18. GALANTHUS nivalis. SNOWDROP.--The first of the productions of Flora\r\nwhich reminds us of the return of spring after the dark and dreary days\r\nof winter. This plant is also made double by cultivation, but is not\r\nhandsomer than the common wild one. The best time for planting the bulbs\r\nof Snowdrops is in the month of September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19. GENTIANA verna. VERNAL GENTIAN.--A delightful little plant of the\r\nfinest blue colour the Flora exhibits in all her glory: its scent is\r\nalso delightful: it is somewhat scarce and difficult to procure; but if\r\nmore generally known, few gardens would be destitute of such a treasure.\r\nIt is of tolerably easy culture, and grows well in loam: it is small,\r\nand is best kept in a pot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20. GENTIANA Pneumonanthe. MARSH GENTIAN.--Is also a beautiful plant,\r\nand grows well in any moist place. From its beautiful blue flowers it is\r\nwell adapted to the flower garden; it delights in bog earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21. GERANIUM phaeum. BLACK-FLOWERED GERANIUM.--This is a perennial, and\r\nmakes a fine ornamental plant for the shrubbery: it will grow in any\r\nsoil and situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22. GLAUCUM Phoeniceum. PURPLE HORN POPPY.--An annual flower of\r\nsingular beauty, and deserving a place in the flower garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23. GNAPHALIUM margaritaceum. AMERICAN CUDWEED.--This plant affords\r\nbeautiful white flowers, which drying and keeping their colour, it is\r\nworth attention on that account, as it affords a pleasing variety with\r\nthe different Xeranthema, and others of the like class in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n24. HIERACUM aurantiacum. GRIM-THE-COLLIER.--This is an old inhabitant\r\nof our gardens, and affords a pleasing variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n25. HOTTONIA palustris. WATER VIOLET.--This is a plant of singular\r\nbeauty in spring; it is an aquatic, and makes a fine appearance in our\r\nponds in the time of its bloom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26. IBERIS amara. CANDYTUFT.--An annual flower of considerable beauty\r\nand interest. We have several varieties of this sold in the seed-shops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n27. IMPATIENS NOLI ME TANGERE.--A very curious flower which is grown as\r\nan annual. The construction of the seed-vessel causing the seeds to be\r\ndischarged with an elastic force is a pleasing phaenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n28. LATHYRUS sylvestris.--EVERLASTING PEA.--This is also a great\r\nornament, and frequently found in gardens; it grows very readily from\r\nseeds sown in the spring of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n29. LEUCOJUM aestivum. SUMMER SNOW FLAKE.--This is a very noxious plant\r\nin the meadows where it grows wild. I have seen it in the neighbourhood\r\nof Wooking in Surrey quite overpower the grass with its herbage in the\r\nspring, and no kind of that animal that we know of will eat it.\r\n\r\nIt is however considered an ornamental plant, and is often found in our\r\nflower gardens. It is of easy culture: the roots may be planted in any\r\nof the autumn or winter months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30. MALVA moschata. MUSK MALLOW.--This makes a fine appearance when in\r\nbloom, for which purpose it is often propagated in gardens: its scent,\r\nwhich is strong of vegetable musk, is also very pleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n31. MELLITIS mellyssophyllum. MELLITIS grandiflora. BASTARD BALM.--Both\r\nthese plants are very beautiful, and are deserving a place in the flower\r\ngarden: they are of easy culture, and will grow well under the shade of\r\ntrees, a property that will always recommend them to the notice of the\r\ncurious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n32. MENYANTHES Nymphoides. ROUND-LEAVED BOG BEAN.--This is a\r\nbeautiful aquatic, and claims a place in all ornamental pieces of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n33. NARCISSUS poeticus. NARCISSUS Pseudo Narcissus.--These are much\r\ncultivated in gardens for the sake of the flowers. The florists have by\r\nculture made several varieties, as Double blossoms which are great\r\nornaments. The season for planting the bulbs of Narcissus of all\r\nkinds is the month of October: they will grow well in any soil, and\r\nthrive best under the shade of trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n34. NUPHAR minima is also beautiful, but it is not common. It\r\nwill form an ornament for pieces of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n35. NYMPHAEA alba. NYMPHAEA lutea.--These are aquatics, and scarcely\r\nany plant is more deserving of our attention. The fine appearance of the\r\nfoliage floating on the surface, which is interspersed with beautiful\r\nflowers, will render any piece of water very interesting: it should also\r\nbe observed that gold-fish are found to thrive best when they have the\r\nadvantage of the shade of these plants. It is difficult in deep water to\r\nmake them take root, being liable to float on the surface, in which\r\nstate they will not succeed. But if the plants are placed in some\r\nstrong clay or loam tied down in wicker baskets and then placed in the\r\nwater, there is no fear of their success: they should be placed where\r\nthe water is sufficiently deep to inundate the roots two feet or a\r\nlittle more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n36. OPHRYS apifera. BEE ORCHIS.--There are few plants that are more\r\ngenerally admired than all the Orchideae for their singular beauty and\r\nuncommon structure. The one in question so very much resembles the\r\nhumble-bee in appearance, that I have known persons mistake this flower\r\nfor the animal. It is unfortunate for the amateurs of gardening that\r\nmost plants of this tribe are difficult of propagation, and are not of\r\neasy culture. I have sometimes succeeded with this and other species, by\r\nthe following method:--to take up the roots from their native places of\r\ngrowth as early as they can be found, and then procure some chalk and\r\nsift it through a fine sieve, and also some good tenacious loam; mix\r\nboth in equal quantities in water; a large garden-pot should then be\r\nfilled with some rubble of chalk, about one third deep, and then the\r\nabove compost over it, placing the roots in the centre, at the usual\r\ndepth they grew before. As the water drains away, the loam and chalk\r\nwill become fixed closely round the bulbs, and they will remain alive\r\nand grow. By this method I have cultivated these plants for some years\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIn this way all those kinds growing in chalk may be made to grow; but\r\nsuch as the Orchis moryo, maculata, and pyramidalis, may be grown in\r\nloam alone, planted in pots in the common way. Care should be taken that\r\nthe pots in which they are planted are protected from wet and frost in\r\nthe winter season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n37. ORNITHOGALUM latifolium and umbellatum are also ornamental, and are\r\noften cultivated for their beautiful flower. The season for planting the\r\nbulbs is about the month of September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n38. PAPAVER somniferum. GREATER POPPY. PAPAVER Rhoeas. CARNATION POPPY.\r\n--These are made by culture into numerous varieties, and are very\r\nbeautiful; but the aroma, which is pregnant with opium, renders too many\r\nof them unpleasant for the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n39. POLEMONIUM coeruleum. GREEK VALERIAN, or JACOB'S LADDER.--Is also a\r\nbeautiful perennial, and claims the notice of the gardener. Its\r\nvariety, with white flowers, is also ornamental. It is raised\r\nfrom seeds, which are sold in plenty in our seed-shops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n40. PRIMULA officinalis. COWSLIP. PRIMULA vulgaris. PRIMROSE. PRIMULA\r\nelatior. OXLIP. PRIMULA farinose. BIRD'S EYE.--All well known ornaments\r\nof numerous varieties, double and single. The third species is the\r\nparent of the celebrated Polyanthus. The last is also an interesting\r\nlittle plant with a purple flower. It grows best in bog earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n41. ROSA rubiginosa. SWEET BRIAR.--This lovely and highly extolled shrub\r\nhas long claimed a place in our gardens. We have several varieties with\r\ndouble flowers, which are highly prized by the amateurs of gardening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n42. SAXIFRAGA umbrosa. LONDON PRIDE.---A beautiful little plant for\r\nforming edgings to the flower garden, or for decorating rock-work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n43. SAXIFRAGA oppositifolia. PURPLE SAXIFRAGE.--Perhaps we have few\r\nflowers early in the spring that deserve more attention than this. It\r\nblooms in the months of February and March, and in that dreary season,\r\nin company with the Snow-drop, Crocus, and Hepaticas, will form a most\r\ndelightful group of Flora's rich production. The Saxifrage is a native\r\nof high mountains, and it can only be propagated by being continually\r\nexposed to the open and bleakest part of the garden: it succeeds best in\r\npots. It should be parted every spring, and a small piece about the size\r\nof a shilling planted in the centre of a small pot, and it will fill the\r\nsurface by the autumn. The soil bestsuited to it is loam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n44. SEDUM acre. STONE CROP. SEDUM rupestre. ROCK GINGER.--All the\r\nspecies of Sedums are very ornamental plants, and are useful for\r\ncovering rocks or walls, where they will generally grow with little\r\ntrouble. The easiest mode of propagating and getting them to grow on\r\nsuch places is first to make the place fit for their reception, by\r\nputting thereon a little loam made with a paste of cow-dung; then\r\nchopping the plants in small pieces, and strowing them on the place: if\r\nthis is done in the spring, the places will be well covered in a short\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n45. STATICE Armeria. THRIFT.--This plant is valuable for making edgings\r\nto the flower garden. It should be parted, and planted for this purpose\r\neither in the months of August and September, or April and May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n46. STIPA pinnata. FEATHER GRASS.--We have few plants of more interest\r\nthan this; its beautiful feathery bloom is but little inferior to the\r\nplumage of the celebrated Bird of Paradise. It is frequently worn in the\r\nhead-dress of ladies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n47. SWERTIA perennis. MARSH SWERTIA.--This is a beautiful little plant,\r\nand worth the attention of all persons who are fond of flowers that will\r\ngrow in boggy land. It is a perennial, and of easy culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n48. TROLLIUS europaeus. GLOBE FLOWER.--This is also a fine plant:\r\nwhen cultivated in a moist soil its beautiful yellow flowers afford a\r\npleasing accompaniment to the flower border and parterre in the spring\r\nof the year. It is easily raised by parting its roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n49. TULIPA sylvestris.--This beautiful flower is also an inhabitant of\r\nour flower-gardens; it is called the Sweet-scented Florentine Tulip. It\r\nhas a delightful scent when in bloom, and is highly worthy the attention\r\nof amateurs of flower gardens. It should be planted in September, and\r\nwill grow in almost any soil or situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n50. TYPHA latifolia. TYPHA angustifolia. TYPHA minor.--These are all\r\nvery fine aquatics, and worth a place in all pieces of water; the\r\nfoliage forms a fine shelter for water-fowl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n51. VIOLA tricolor. HEART'S-EASE.--Is an annual of singular beauty, and\r\nforms many pleasing and interesting varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n52. VIOLA odorata must not be passed over among our favourite native\r\nflowers. This is of all other plants in its kind the most interesting.\r\nIt forms also several varieties; as Double purple, Double white, and the\r\nNeapolitan violet. The latter one is double, of a beautiful light blue\r\ncolour, and flowers early; it is rather tender, and requires the\r\nprotection of a hot-bed frame during winter. It is best cultivated in\r\npots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n53. VINCA minor. LESSER PERIWINKLE.--This is also a beautiful little\r\nevergreen, of which the gardeners have several varieties in cultivation;\r\nsome with double flowers, others with white and red-coloured corols,\r\nwhich form a pleasing diversity in summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n54. VINCA major. GREAT PERIWINKLE.-I know of no plant of more beauty,\r\nwhen it is properly managed, than this. It is an evergreen of the most\r\npleasing hue, and will cover any low fences or brick-work in a short\r\nspace of time. The flowers, which are purple, form a pleasing variety in\r\nthe spring months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n53. BETA vulgaris. I have noticed this plant before, both as to its\r\nculinary uses and for feeding cattle: but having received a\r\ncommunication from a friend of mine who resides in the interior of\r\nRussia, relative to his establishment for extracting sugar from this\r\nroot, I cannot omit relating it here, as it appears to be an interesting\r\npart of agricultural oeconomy.\r\n\r\n\"I have here two extensive fabrics for the purpose of making sugar from\r\nthe Red Beet, and we find that it yields us that useful article in great\r\nabundance; i. e. from every quarter of the root (eight bushels\r\nWinchester measure) I obtain ten pounds weight of good brown sugar; and\r\nthis when refined produces us four pounds of the finest clarified lump\r\nsugar, and the molasses yield good brandy on distillation. This is not\r\nall; for while we are now working the article the cows are stall-fed on\r\nthe refuse from the vats after mashing; and those animals give us milk\r\nin abundance, and the butter we are making is equal to any that is made\r\nin the summer, when those animals are foraging our best meads.\"--\r\nDashkoff, in the government of Orel, 1500 miles from St. Petersburgh,\r\nJan 7, 1816.\r\n\r\nThe above account, which is so extremely flattering, may no doubt lead\r\npersons to imagine that the culture of the beet for the same purpose in\r\nthis country might be found to answer: and as it is our aim in this\r\nlittle work to give the best information on these subjects without\r\nprejudice, I shall beg leave to make use of the following observation,\r\nwhich is not my own, but one that was made on this subject by a Russian\r\ngentleman, whom I have long had the honour of enumerating among my best\r\nfriends; and who is not less distinguished for his application both to\r\nthe arts and oeconomy, than he is for his professional duties, and his\r\nreadiness at all times to communicate information for the general good.\r\n\r\n\"The land where the Beet is grown is of an excellent quality, very deep\r\nand fertile, and such as will grow any crop for a series of years\r\nwithout manure. Such soils are seldom found in this country but what may\r\nbe cultivated to more advantage. In such land, and such alone, will this\r\nvegetable imbibe a large quantity of the saccharine fluid; for it would\r\nbe in vain to look for it in such Beet roots as have been grown on poor\r\nland made rich by dint of manure.\r\n\r\n\"It may also be a circumstance worth remarking, that although the sugar\r\nthus obtained is very good for common use, it by no means answers the\r\npurpose of the confectioner, as it is not fit for preserving; and for\r\nthis purpose the cane sugar alone is used; so that although great merit\r\nmay attach to the industry of a person who in times of scarcity can\r\nproduce such an useful article as sugar from a vegetable so easily\r\ngrown, yet when cane sugar can be imported at a moderate rate, it will\r\nalways supersede the use of the other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n56. PYRUS malus. THE APPLE.--This useful fruit, now growing so much to\r\ndecay in this country, which was once so celebrated for its produce, is\r\ngrown in great perfection in all the northern provinces of France; and\r\nshe supplied the London markets with apples this season, for which she\r\nwas paid upwards of 50,000 l.; and can most likely offer us good cyder\r\non moderate terms.\r\n\r\nThe French people, ever alive to improvement and invention, having\r\ndiscovered a mode of extracting sugar in considerable quantity from this\r\nfruit, I shall transcribe the particulars of it.\r\n\r\nOn the Preparation of Liquid Sugar from Apples or Pears. By M. DUBUC.\r\n(Ann. de Chim. vol. lxviii.)--\"Several establishments have been made in\r\nthe South of France for making sugar from grapes; it is therefore\r\ndesired to communicate the same advantage to the North of France, as\r\napples and pears will produce sugar whose taste is equally agreeable as\r\nthat of grapes, and equally cheap.\r\n\r\n\"Eight quarts of the full ripe juice of the Orange Apples was boiled for\r\na quarter of an hour, and forty grammes of powdered chalk added to it,\r\nand the boiling continued for ten minutes longer. The liquor was\r\nstrained twice through flannel, and afterwards reduced by boiling to one\r\nhalf of its former bulk, and the operation finished by a slow heat until\r\na thick pellicle rose on the surface, and a quart of the syrup weighed\r\ntwo pounds. By this method two pounds one ounce of liquid sugar was\r\nobtained, very agreeable in flavour, and which sweetened water very\r\nwell, and even milk, without curdling it.\r\n\r\n\"Eight quarts of the juice of apples called Doux levesque, yielded by\r\nthe same process two pounds twelve ounces of liquid sugar.\r\n\r\n\"Eight quarts of the juice of the sour apples called Blanc mollet,\r\nyielded two pounds ten ounces of good sugar.\r\n\r\n\"Eight quarts of the juice of the watery apples called Girard, yielded\r\ntwo pounds and a half.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-five chilogrammes, or fifty-pounds of the above four apples,\r\nyielded nearly fourty-two pounds of juice; which took three ounces of\r\nchalk and the white of six eggs, and produced more than six pounds of\r\nexcellent liquid sugar.\r\n\r\n\"In order to do without the white of eggs, twenty pounds of the juice of\r\nthe above apples were saturated with eleven drachms of chalk, and\r\nrepeatedly strained through flannel, but it was still thick and\r\ndisagreeable to the taste; twelve drachms of charcoal powder were then\r\nadded, and the whole boiled for about ten minutes, and then strained\r\nthrough flannel; it was then clear, but higher-coloured than usual;\r\nhowever, it produced very good sugar. Six quarts of apple-juice were\r\nalso treated with seven drachms of chalk, and one ounce of baker's\r\nsmall-coal previously washed until it no longer coloured the water, with\r\nthe same effect.\r\n\r\n\"Eight quarts of apple juice, of several different kinds and in\r\ndifferent stages of ripeness, of which one-third was still sour, were\r\nsaturated with twelve drachms of chalk, and clarified with the whites of\r\nsix eggs; some malate of lime was deposited in small crystals towards\r\nthe end, and separated by passing the syrup very hot through the\r\nflannel. Very near two pounds of sugar were obtained.\r\n\r\n\"Ten pounds of bruised apples, similar to the last, were left to\r\nmacerate for twenty-four hours, and four quarts of the juice were\r\ntreated with five drachms of chalk and the white of an egg: it yielded\r\none pound six ounces of liquid sugar; so that the maceration had been of\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-four pounds of the pear called Pillage, yielded nine quarts of\r\njuice, which required eighteen drachms of chalk and the whites of two\r\neggs, and yielded about twenty-four ounces of sugar, which was less\r\nagreeable to the taste than that of ripe apples.\r\n\r\n\"Six quarts of juice from one part of the above pears, and two of ripe\r\napples, (orange and girard,) treated with eight drachms of chalk and the\r\nwhites of two eggs, yielded twenty-six ounces of very fine-tasted sugar,\r\nsuperior to the preceding.\r\n\r\n\"Six quarts of juice, of an equal quantity of apples and pears, treated\r\nwith ten drachms of chalk and thirteen of prepared charcoal, deposited\r\nsome malate of lime, and yielded a sugar rather darker than the\r\npreceding, but very well tasted.\r\n\r\n\"Cadet de Vaux says, that apple juice does not curdle milk, and that a\r\nsmall quantity of chalk added to it destroys some part of the saccharine\r\nprinciple. But eight quarts of juice from ripe apples called orange,\r\nwhich was evidently acid, as it curdled milk and reddened infusion of\r\nturnsole and that of violet, were treated with four drachms of chalk and\r\nthe white of an egg: it yielded twenty-two ounces of syrup, between\r\nthirty-two and thirty-three degrees of the hydrometer, which did not\r\ncurdle milk. Another eight quarts of the same juice evaporated to\r\nthree-fourths of its volume, and strained, yielded twenty-three ounces\r\nof clear syrup, which curdled milk, and was browner than that of the\r\nneutralized juice, and approached towards treacle in smell and taste.\r\nPerhaps the apple called Jean-hure, used by Mr. Cadet, possesses the\r\nvaluable properties of furnishing good sugar by mere evaporation. It is\r\nnecessary to observe, that unless the fire is slackened towards the end\r\nthe syrup goes brown, and acquires the taste and smell of burnt sugar.\r\n\r\n\"A hundred weight of apples yield about eighty-four pounds of juice,\r\nwhich produce nearly twelve pounds of liquid sugar. Supposing,\r\ntherefore, the average price of apples to be one franc twenty cents\r\n(tenpence) the hundred-weight, and the charge amounts to forty cents\r\n(four-pence), good sugar may be prepared for three or four sols (two-\r\npence) per pound [Footnote: A gramme, fifteen grains English.-A drachm,\r\none-eighth of an ounce.]. The only extra apparatus necessary is a couple\r\nof copper evaporating pans.\"--Retrospect, vol. vi. p. 14.\r\n\r\nThe distressed state of our orchards in the Cider counties has lately\r\nmuch engaged the attention of all persons who are accustomed to travel\r\nthrough them; and no one can possibly view the miserable condition of\r\nthe trees, without being forcibly struck with their bad appearance: the\r\nprincipal case of which, I am sorry to say, has arisen from\r\nmismanagement [Footnote: Vide Observations on Orchards, lately published\r\nby the author of this work.]; and it certainly does in a great measure\r\ntarnish the laurels of our boasted agriculturists, when we find such\r\ngreat quantities of this useful fruit produced in France, that very\r\ncountry which we have been taught to believe so greatly behind us in the\r\ngeneral oeconomy of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n57. SPERGULA arvensis.--This plant has been recommended as a crop for\r\nfeeding cattle, and is stated to be cultivated for that purpose in some\r\nparts of Germany and Flanders: but I believe we have many other plants\r\nbetter calculated for the purpose here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n58. VIOLA odorata.--This is a very useful plant in medicine, affording\r\na syrup which has long been used in the practice. It is however\r\ndiscarded from the London Pharmacopoeia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n59. URTICA canadensis. CANADIAN HEMP NETTLE.--During the late war,\r\nwhen, from unfortunate circumstances and misunderstandings amongst the\r\npotentates of Europe, the commercial intercourse was checked, great\r\nspeculations were made among the people to discover substitutes for such\r\narticles as were of certain demand; and one of the principal was of\r\ncourse the article Hemp, which, although it can be partially cultivated\r\nin this country, is a plant of that nature that we should find the\r\narticle at a most enormous price were we dependent on our own supply\r\nalone. The great growth that supplies all the markets in the world is\r\nRussia, where land is not only cheap, but of better quality than here;\r\nbut with which country we were once unhappily deprived of the advantage\r\nof trade. This caused persons to seek for substitutes: and I once saw\r\none that was made from bean-stalks, not to be despised; but it is\r\nprobable that none has reached so high in perfection as that produced\r\nfrom the plant above named. A person has grown and manufactured this\r\narticle in Canada, and has exhibited some samples in London, which it is\r\nsaid have obtained the sanction of government, and that the same person\r\nis now engaged in growing in North America a considerable quantity of\r\nthis article. As this, therefore, is a subject of great interest to us\r\nas a maritime nation, I shall insert the following account that is given\r\nof this plant. I am, however, quite unacquainted with its culture or\r\nmanufacture, and cannot pledge myself for the accuracy of the detail.\r\n\r\n\"PERENNIAL HEMP. Cultivation.--Affects wet mellow land, but may be\r\ncultivated with advantage on upland black mould or loam, if moist and of\r\nmiddling good quality. Manure will assist the produce. It may be planted\r\nfrom the beginning of October to the latter end of March, in drills\r\nabout fifteen inches asunder and nine inches distance in the drills.\r\n\r\n\"Propagation.--Sow the seeds in a bed in the month of March, and\r\ntransplant the roots next autumn twelvemonth, as above directed; or\r\ndivide the old roots, which is the quickest way of obtaining a crop.\r\n\r\n\"Time of Harvesting.--If a fine quality of Hemp is desired, mow the\r\ncrop when it is in full bloom; but should a greater produce of inferior\r\nquality be more desirable, it should stand until the seeds are nearly\r\nripe. It should remain in the field about a week after it is mown, and\r\nwhen sufficiently dry gathered in bundles and stacked as Hemp.\r\n\r\n\"Separation of Hemp from the Pulps.--Rot it in water, as practised with\r\nHemp.\r\n\r\n\"The Perennial Hemp grows to the height of from four to six feet.\r\n\r\n\"The root inclines horizontally with numerous fleshy fibres at the\r\nextremity.\r\n\r\n\"The buds many, and resembling the buds of the Lily of the Valley.\r\n\r\n\"It is the Urtica canadensis of Kalm, one of which was brought over and\r\nplanted by the side of this plant, and we could not find any difference.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n60. LAPSANA communis. NIPPLE-WORT.--This plant is considered by the\r\ncountry people as a sovereign remedy for the piles. The plant is\r\nimmersed in boiling water, and the cure is effected by applying the\r\nsteam arising therefrom to the seat of the disease; and this, with\r\ncooling medicine and proper regimen, is seldom known to fail in curing\r\nthis troublesome disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n61. DAPHNE laureola. WOOD LAUREL.--The leaves of this plant have little\r\nor no smell but a very durable nauseous acrid taste. If taken internally\r\nin small doses, as ten or twelve grains, they are said to operate with\r\nviolence by stool and sometimes by vomit, so as not to be ventured on\r\nwith safety, unless their virulence be previously abated by long\r\nboiling, and even then they are much to precarious to be trusted to. The\r\nflowers are of a different nature, being in taste little other than\r\nmucilaginous and sweetish, and of a light pleasant smell. The pulpy part\r\nof the berries appears also to be harmless. The bark macerated in water\r\nhas of late been much employed in France as a topical application to the\r\nskin for the purpose of excoriating and exciting a discharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n62. RUMEX acutus. SHARP-POINTED DOCK.--The root of this plant has long\r\nbeen used in medicine, and considered as useful in habitual costiveness,\r\nobstructions of the viscera, and in scorbutic and cutaneous maladies; in\r\nwhich case both external and internal applications have been made of it.\r\nA decoction of half or a whole drachm of the dry roots has been\r\nconsidered a dose.--Lewis's Mat. Medica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n63. ELYMUS arenarius. ELYMUS geniculatus. LIME GRASS.--The foliage of\r\nthese grasses make excellent mats and baskets; and where they grow in\r\nquantity afford a livelihood to many industrious persons who manufacture\r\nthese articles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n64. SALSOLA Kali. GLASS-WORT, or KELP. Soda and Barilla are yielded by\r\nthis plant. The ashes of this vegetable yield an alkaline salt, which is\r\nof considerable use for making glass, soap, &c. The small quantity grown\r\nin this country is by no means equal to the demand, and Spain has the\r\nadvantage of trade in this article, where the plant grows wild in the\r\ngreatest abundance. An impure alkali similar to these is obtained from\r\nthe combustion of other marine plants, as the Fuci, &c. by the people in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n65. BORAGO officinalis. BORAGE--A fine cooling beverage is made from\r\nthis herb, called Cool Tankard. It is merely an infusion of the leaves\r\nand flowers put into water, with the addition of wine, nutmeg, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS on the BLEEDING TREES, and procuring the Sap for making\r\nWine, and brewing Ale.\r\n\r\nIn the article BIRCH TREE, (p. 34, No. 107, of this volume,) we have\r\nmentioned the abstracting the sap for the purpose of making wine; and as\r\nthis is practicable, and may be obtained in some places at little\r\nexpense and trouble, I shall take the liberty of transcribing the\r\nfollowing curious paper on the subject.\r\n\r\n\"To obtain the greatest store of sap in the shortest time from the body\r\nof a tree, bore it quite through the pith, and the very inner rind on\r\nthe other side, leaving only the bark unpierced on the north-east side.\r\nThis hole to be made sloping upwards with a large auger, and that under\r\na large arm near the ground. This way the tree will in a short time\r\nafford liquor enough to brew with; and with some of these sweet saps,\r\none bushel of malt will make as good ale as four bushels with ordinary\r\nwater. The Sycamore yields the best brewing sap.\r\n\r\n\"The change of weather has a great effect on the bleeding of plants.\r\nWhen the weather changes from warm to cold, Birch ceases to bleed, and\r\nupon the next warmth begins again: but the contrary obtains in the\r\nWalnut-tree, and frequently in the Sycamore, which upon a fit of cold\r\nwill bleed plentifully, and, as that remits, stop. A morning sun after\r\nfrost will make the whole bleeding tribe bleed afresh.\r\n\r\n\"From the latter end of January to the middle of May trees will bleed.\r\nThose that run first, are the Poplar, Asp, Abele, Maple, Sycamore. Some,\r\nas Willows and the Birch, are best to tap about the middle of the\r\nseason, and the Walnut towards the latter end of March.\r\n\r\n\"When a large Walnut will bleed no longer in the body or branches, it\r\nwill run at the root, and longer on the south or sunny side than on the\r\nnorth or shady side.\r\n\r\n\"A culinary fire will have the same or greater effect than the sun, and\r\nimmediately set trees a-bleeding in the severest weather. Branches of\r\nMaple or Willow cut off at both ends, will bleed and cease at pleasure\r\nagain and again as you approach them to or withdraw them from the fire,\r\nprovided you balance them in your hand, and often invert them to prevent\r\nthe falling and expence of the sap; but at length they cease.\r\n\r\n\"A Birch will not bleed however deeply the bark only may be wounded: it\r\nis necessary to pierce into the substance of the wood.\"--Dr. Tonge in\r\nPhil.
