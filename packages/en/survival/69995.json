W.\r\nPowell, geologist in charge of the United States Geographical and\r\nGeological Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region, upon the lands of\r\nthe Arid Region of the United States, setting forth the extent of\r\nsaid region, and making suggestions as to the conditions under which\r\nthe lands embraced within its limit may be rendered available for\r\nagricultural and grazing purposes. With the report is transmitted a\r\nstatement of the rainfall of the western portion of the United States,\r\nwith reports upon the subject of irrigation by Capt. C. E. Dutton, U.\r\nS. A., Prof. A. H. Thompson, and Mr. G. K. Gilbert.\r\n\r\nHerewith are also transmitted draughts of two bills, one entitled “A\r\nbill to authorize the organization of pasturage districts by homestead\r\nsettlements on the public lands which are of value for pasturage\r\npurposes only”, and the other “A bill to authorize the organization of\r\nirrigation districts by homestead settlements upon the public lands\r\nrequiring irrigation for agricultural purposes”, intended to carry\r\ninto effect a new system for the disposal of the public lands of said\r\nregion, and to promote the settlement and development of that portion\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nIn view of the importance of rendering the vast extent of country\r\nreferred to available for agricultural and grazing purposes, I have\r\nthe honor to commend the views set forth by Major Powell and the bills\r\nsubmitted herewith to the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\n                                                      Very respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                            C.

C., _April 1, 1878_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to submit herewith a report from Maj. J. W.\r\nPowell, in charge of the Geographical and Geological Survey of the\r\nRocky Mountains, in regard to the Arid Region of the United States,\r\nand draughts of two bills, one entitled “A bill to authorize the\r\norganization of pasturage districts by homestead settlements on the\r\npublic lands which are of value for pasturage purposes only”, and the\r\nother “A bill to authorize the organization of irrigation districts by\r\nhomestead settlements upon the public lands requiring irrigation for\r\nagricultural purposes”.\r\n\r\nMajor Powell reviews at length the features of, and furnishes\r\nstatistics relative to, the Arid Region of the United States, which is\r\nsubstantially the territory west of the one hundredth meridian and east\r\nof the Cascade Range, and the bills named are intended, if passed, to\r\ncarry into effect the views expressed in his report for the settlement\r\nand development of this region.\r\n\r\nHe has, in the performance of his duties in conducting the geological\r\nand geographical survey, been over much of the country referred to,\r\nand is qualified by observation, research, and study to speak of the\r\ntopography, characteristics, and adaptability of the same.\r\n\r\nI have not been able, on account of more urgent official duties, to\r\ngive Major Powell’s report and proposed bills the careful investigation\r\nnecessary, in view of their great importance, to enable me to express\r\na decided opinion as to their merits. Some change is necessary in the\r\nsurvey and disposal of the lands, and I think his views are entitled\r\nto great weight, and would respectfully recommend that such action\r\nbe taken as will bring his report and bills before Congress for\r\nconsideration by that body.\r\n\r\n                                                      Very respectfully,\r\n                                                      J. A. WILLIAMSON,\r\n                                                      _Commissioner_.\r\n\r\n                                            Hon. C. SCHURZ,\r\n                                            _Secretary of the Interior_.\r\n\r\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,\r\n  U. S. GEOGRAPHICAL AND GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN REGION,\r\n  WASHINGTON, D. C., _April 1, 1878_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to transmit herewith a report on the lands of the\r\nArid Region of the United States. After setting forth the general facts\r\nrelating to the conditions under which these lands must be utilized, I\r\nhave taken the liberty to suggest a system for their disposal which I\r\nbelieve would be adapted to the wants of the country.\r\n\r\nI wish to express my sincere thanks for the assistance you have given\r\nme in the collection of many of the facts necessary to the discussion,\r\nand especially for the aid you have rendered in the preparation of the\r\nmaps.\r\n\r\nPermit me to express the hope that the great interest you take in the\r\npublic domain will be rewarded by the consciousness that you have\r\nassisted many citizens in the establishment of farm homes thereon.\r\n\r\n               I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n               J. W. POWELL,\r\n               _In charge U. S. G. and G. Survey Rocky Mountain Region_.\r\n\r\n                   Hon. J. A. WILLIAMSON,\r\n                   _Commissioner General Land Office, Washington, D. C._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to write a work on the Public Domain. The object\r\nof the volume was to give the extent and character of the lands yet\r\nbelonging to the Government of the United States. Compared with the\r\nwhole extent of these lands, but a very small fraction is immediately\r\navailable for agriculture; in general, they require drainage or\r\nirrigation for their redemption.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the Southern States there are some millions of\r\nacres, chiefly timber lands, which at no remote time will be occupied\r\nfor agricultural purposes. Westward toward the Great Plains, the lands\r\nin what I have, in the body of this volume, termed the Humid Region\r\nhave passed from the hands of the General Government. To this statement\r\nthere are some small exceptions here and there--fractional tracts,\r\nwhich, for special reasons, have not been considered desirable by\r\npersons in search of lands for purposes of investment or occupation.\r\n\r\nIn the Sub-humid Region settlements are rapidly extending westward\r\nto the verge of the country where agriculture is possible without\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\nIn the Humid Region of the Columbia the agricultural lands are largely\r\ncovered by great forests, and for this reason settlements will progress\r\nslowly, as the lands must be cleared of their timber.\r\n\r\nThe redemption of the Arid Region involves engineering problems\r\nrequiring for their solution the greatest skill. In the present volume\r\nonly these lands are considered. Had I been able to execute the\r\noriginal plan to my satisfaction, I should have treated of the coast\r\nswamps of the South Atlantic and the Gulf slopes, the Everglade lands\r\nof the Floridian Peninsula, the flood plain lands of the great rivers\r\nof the south, which have heretofore been made available only to a\r\nlimited extent by a system of levees, and the lake swamp lands found\r\nabout the headwaters of the Mississippi and the region of the upper\r\nGreat Lakes. All of these lands require either drainage or protection\r\nfrom overflow, and the engineering problems involved are of diverse\r\nnature. These lands are to be redeemed from excessive humidity,\r\nwhile the former are to be redeemed from excessive aridity. When\r\nthe excessively humid lands are redeemed, their fertility is almost\r\ninexhaustible, and the agricultural capacity of the United States will\r\neventually be largely increased by the rescue of these lands from\r\ntheir present valueless condition. In like manner, on the other hand,\r\nthe arid lands, so far as they can be redeemed by irrigation, will\r\nperennially yield bountiful crops, as the means for their redemption\r\ninvolves their constant fertilization.\r\n\r\nTo a great extent, the redemption of all these lands will require\r\nextensive and comprehensive plans, for the execution of which\r\naggregated capital or coöperative labor will be necessary. Here,\r\nindividual farmers, being poor men, cannot undertake the task. For\r\nits accomplishment a wise prevision, embodied in carefully considered\r\nlegislation, is necessary. It was my purpose not only to consider the\r\ncharacter of the lands themselves, but also the engineering problems\r\ninvolved in their redemption, and further to make suggestions for the\r\nlegislative action necessary to inaugurate the enterprises by which\r\nthese lands may eventually be rescued from their present worthless\r\nstate. When I addressed myself to the broader task as indicated above,\r\nI found that my facts in relation to some of the classes of lands\r\nmentioned, especially the coast swamps of the Gulf and some of the\r\nflood plain lands of the southern rivers, were too meager for anything\r\nmore than general statements. There seemed to be no immediate necessity\r\nfor the discussion of these subjects; but to the Arid Region of the\r\nwest thousands of persons are annually repairing, and the questions\r\nrelating to the utilization of these lands are of present importance.\r\nUnder these considerations I have decided to publish that portion of\r\nthe volume relating to the arid lands, and to postpone to some future\r\ntime that part relating to the excessively humid lands.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of the contemplated volume I desired to give a\r\nhistorical sketch of the legislation relating to swamp lands and\r\nexecutive action thereunder; another chapter on bounty lands and land\r\ngrants for agricultural schools, and still another on land grants in\r\naid of internal improvements--chiefly railroads. The latter chapter has\r\nalready been prepared by Mr. Willis Drummond, jr., and as the necessary\r\nmap is ready I have concluded to publish it now, more especially as the\r\ngranted lands largely lie in the Arid Region. Mr. Drummond’s chapter\r\nhas been carefully prepared and finely written, and contains much\r\nvaluable information.\r\n\r\nTo the late Prof. Joseph Henry, secretary of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, I am greatly indebted for access to the records of the\r\nInstitution relating to rainfall. Since beginning my explorations and\r\nsurveys in the far west, I have received the counsel and assistance\r\nof the venerable professor on all important matters relating to my\r\ninvestigations; and whatever of value has been accomplished is due in\r\nno small part to his wisdom and advice. I cannot but express profound\r\nsorrow at the loss of a counselor so wise, so patient, and so courteous.\r\n\r\nI am also indebted to Mr. Charles A. Schott, of the United States Coast\r\nSurvey, to whom the discussion of the rain gauge records has been\r\nintrusted by the Smithsonian Institution, for furnishing to me the\r\nrequired data in advance of publication by himself.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the chapters written by Messrs. Gilbert, Dutton,\r\nThompson, and Drummond have not been proof-read by themselves, by\r\nreason of their absence during the time when the volume was going\r\nthrough the press; but this is the less to be regretted from the fact\r\nthat the whole volume has been proof-read by Mr. J. C. Pilling, whose\r\ncritical skill is all that could be desired.\r\n\r\n                                                                J. W. P.\r\n\r\nAUGUST, 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first edition of this report having been exhausted in a few months\r\nand without satisfying the demand which the importance of the subject\r\ncreated, a second was ordered by Congress in March, 1879. The authors\r\nwere thus given an opportunity to revise their text and eliminate a\r\nfew formal errors which had crept in by reason of their absence while\r\nthe first edition was passing through the press. The substance of the\r\nreport is unchanged.\r\n\r\n                                                                J. W.

W. POWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n             PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ARID REGION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eastern portion of the United States is supplied with abundant\r\nrainfall for agricultural purposes, receiving the necessary amount\r\nfrom the evaporation of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico; but\r\nwestward the amount of aqueous precipitation diminishes in a general\r\nway until at last a region is reached where the climate is so arid that\r\nagriculture is not successful without irrigation. This Arid Region\r\nbegins about midway in the Great Plains and extends across the Rocky\r\nMountains to the Pacific Ocean. But on the northwest coast there is\r\na region of greater precipitation, embracing western Washington and\r\nOregon and the northwest corner of California. The winds impinging on\r\nthis region are freighted with moisture derived from the great Pacific\r\ncurrents; and where this water-laden atmosphere strikes the western\r\ncoast in full force, the precipitation is excessive, reaching a maximum\r\nnorth of the Columbia River of 80 inches annually. But the rainfall\r\nrapidly decreases from the Pacific Ocean eastward to the summit of the\r\nCascade Mountains. It will be convenient to designate this humid area\r\nas the Lower Columbia Region. Rain gauge records have not been made\r\nto such an extent as to enable us to define its eastern and southern\r\nboundaries, but as they are chiefly along high mountains, definite\r\nboundary lines are unimportant in the consideration of agricultural\r\nresources and the questions relating thereto. In like manner on the\r\neast the rain gauge records, though more full, do not give all the\r\nfacts necessary to a thorough discussion of the subject; yet the\r\nrecords are such as to indicate approximately the boundary between\r\nthe Arid Region, where irrigation is necessary to agriculture, and the\r\nHumid Region, where the lands receive enough moisture from the clouds\r\nfor the maturing of crops. Experience teaches that it is not wise to\r\ndepend upon rainfall where the amount is less than 20 inches annually,\r\nif this amount is somewhat evenly distributed throughout the year;\r\nbut if the rainfall is unevenly distributed, so that “rainy seasons”\r\nare produced, the question whether agriculture is possible without\r\nirrigation depends upon the time of the “rainy season” and the amount\r\nof its rainfall. Any unequal distribution of rain through the year,\r\nthough the inequality be so slight as not to produce “rainy seasons”,\r\naffects agriculture either favorably or unfavorably. If the spring and\r\nsummer precipitation exceeds that of the fall and winter, a smaller\r\namount of annual rain may be sufficient; but if the rainfall during the\r\nseason of growing crops is less than the average of the same length\r\nof time during the remainder of the year, a greater amount of annual\r\nprecipitation is necessary. In some localities in the western portion\r\nof the United States this unequal distribution of rainfall through the\r\nseasons affects agriculture favorably, and this is true immediately\r\nwest of the northern portion of the line of 20 inches of rainfall,\r\nwhich extends along the plains from our northern to our southern\r\nboundary.\r\n\r\nThe isohyetal or mean annual rainfall line of 20 inches, as indicated\r\non the rain chart accompanying this report, begins on the southern\r\nboundary of the United States, about 60 miles west of Brownsville,\r\non the Rio Grande del Norte, and intersects the northern boundary\r\nabout 50 miles east of Pembina. Between these two points the line is\r\nvery irregular, but in middle latitudes makes a general curve to the\r\nwestward. On the southern portion of the line the rainfall is somewhat\r\nevenly distributed through the seasons, but along the northern portion\r\nthe rainfall of spring and summer is greater than that of fall and\r\nwinter, and hence the boundary of what has been called the Arid Region\r\nruns farther to the west. Again, there is another modifying condition,\r\nnamely, that of temperature. Where the temperature is greater, more\r\nrainfall is needed; where the temperature is less, agriculture is\r\nsuccessful with a smaller amount of precipitation. But geographically\r\nthis temperature is dependent upon two conditions--altitude and\r\nlatitude. Along the northern portion of the line latitude is an\r\nimportant factor, and the line of possible agriculture without\r\nirrigation is carried still farther westward. This conclusion, based\r\nupon the consideration of rainfall and latitude, accords with the\r\nexperience of the farmers of the region, for it is a well known fact\r\nthat agriculture without irrigation is successfully carried on in the\r\nvalley of the Red River of the North, and also in the southeastern\r\nportion of Dakota Territory. A much more extended series of rain-gauge\r\nrecords than we now have is necessary before this line constituting\r\nthe eastern boundary of the Arid Region can be well defined. It is\r\ndoubtless more or less meandering in its course throughout its whole\r\nextent from south to north, being affected by local conditions of\r\nrainfall, as well as by the general conditions above mentioned; but in\r\na general way it may be represented by the one hundredth meridian, in\r\nsome places passing to the east, in others to the west, but in the main\r\nto the east.\r\n\r\nThe limit of successful agriculture without irrigation has been set\r\nat 20 inches, that the extent of the Arid Region should by no means\r\nbe exaggerated; but at 20 inches agriculture will not be uniformly\r\nsuccessful from season to season. Many droughts will occur; many\r\nseasons in a long series will be fruitless; and it may be doubted\r\nwhether, on the whole, agriculture will prove remunerative. On this\r\npoint it is impossible to speak with certainty. A larger experience\r\nthan the history of agriculture in the western portion of the United\r\nStates affords is necessary to a final determination of the question.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a broad belt separates the Arid Region of the west from the\r\nHumid Region of the east. Extending from the one hundredth meridian\r\neastward to about the isohyetal line of 28 inches, the district of\r\ncountry thus embraced will be subject more or less to disastrous\r\ndroughts, the frequency of which will diminish from west to east.\r\nFor convenience let this be called the Sub-humid Region. Its western\r\nboundary is the line already defined as running irregularly along\r\nthe one hundredth meridian. Its eastern boundary passes west of\r\nthe isohyetal line of 28 inches of rainfall in Minnesota, running\r\napproximately parallel to the western boundary line above described.\r\nNearly one-tenth of the whole area of the United States, exclusive\r\nof Alaska, is embraced in this Sub-humid Region. In the western\r\nportion disastrous droughts will be frequent; in the eastern portion\r\ninfrequent. In the western portion agriculturists will early resort to\r\nirrigation to secure immunity from such disasters, and this event will\r\nbe hastened because irrigation when properly conducted is a perennial\r\nsource of fertilization, and is even remunerative for this purpose\r\nalone; and for the same reason the inhabitants of the eastern part will\r\ngradually develop irrigating methods. It may be confidently expected\r\nthat at a time not far distant irrigation will be practiced to a\r\ngreater or less extent throughout this Sub-humid Region. Its settlement\r\npresents problems differing materially from those pertaining to the\r\nregion to the westward. Irrigation is not immediately necessary, and\r\nhence agriculture does not immediately depend upon capital. The region\r\nmay be settled and its agricultural capacities more or less developed,\r\nand the question of the construction of irrigating canals may be a\r\nmatter of time and convenience. For many reasons, much of the sub-humid\r\nbelt is attractive to settlers: it is almost destitute of forests, and\r\nfor this reason is more readily subdued, as the land is ready for the\r\nplow. But because of the lack of forests the country is more dependent\r\nupon railroads for the transportation of building and fencing materials\r\nand for fuel. To a large extent it is a region where timber may be\r\nsuccessfully cultivated. As the rainfall is on a general average nearly\r\nsufficient for continuous successful agriculture, the amount of water\r\nto be supplied by irrigating canals will be comparatively small, so\r\nthat its streams can serve proportionally larger areas than the streams\r\nof the Arid Region. In its first settlement the people will be favored\r\nby having lands easily subdued, but they will have to contend against a\r\nlack of timber. Eventually this will be a region of great agricultural\r\nwealth, as in general the soils are good. From our northern to our\r\nsouthern boundary no swamp lands are found, except to some slight\r\nextent in the northeastern portion, and it has no excessively hilly or\r\nmountainous districts. It is a beautiful prairie country throughout,\r\nlacking somewhat in rainfall; but this want can be easily supplied by\r\nutilizing the living streams; and, further, these streams will afford\r\nfertilizing materials of great value.\r\n\r\nThe Humid Region of the lower Columbia and the Sub-humid Region of the\r\nGreat Plains have been thus briefly indicated in order that the great\r\nArid Region, which is the subject of this paper, may be more clearly\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE ARID REGION.\r\n\r\nThe Arid Region is the great Rocky Mountain Region of the United\r\nStates, and it embraces something more than four-tenths of the\r\nwhole country, excluding Alaska. In all this region the mean annual\r\nrainfall is insufficient for agriculture, but in certain seasons some\r\nlocalities, now here, now there, receive more than their average\r\nsupply. Under such conditions crops will mature without irrigation.\r\nAs such seasons are more or less infrequent even in the more favored\r\nlocalities, and as the agriculturist cannot determine in advance\r\nwhen such seasons may occur, the opportunities afforded by excessive\r\nrainfall cannot be improved.\r\n\r\nIn central and northern California an unequal distribution of rainfall\r\nthrough the seasons affects agricultural interests favorably. A “rainy\r\nseason” is here found, and the chief precipitation occurs in the months\r\nof December-April. The climate, tempered by mild winds from the broad\r\nexpanse of Pacific waters, is genial, and certain crops are raised by\r\nsowing the seeds immediately before or during the “rainy season”, and\r\nthe watering which they receive causes the grains to mature so that\r\nfairly remunerative crops are produced. But here again the lands are\r\nsubject to the droughts of abnormal seasons. As many of these lands can\r\nbe irrigated, the farmers of the country are resorting more and more\r\nto the streams, and soon all the living waters of this region will be\r\nbrought into requisition.\r\n\r\nIn the tables of a subsequent chapter this will be called the San\r\nFrancisco Region.\r\n\r\nAgain in eastern Washington and Oregon, and perhaps in northern Idaho,\r\nagriculture is practiced to a limited extent without irrigation. The\r\nconditions of climate by which this is rendered possible are not yet\r\nfully understood. The precipitation of moisture on the mountains is\r\ngreater than on the lowlands, but the hills and mesas adjacent to the\r\ngreat masses of mountains receive a little of the supply condensed by\r\nthe mountains themselves, and it will probably be found that limited\r\nlocalities in Montana, and even in Wyoming, will be favored by this\r\ncondition to an extent sufficient to warrant agricultural operations\r\nindependent of irrigation. These lands, however, are usually supplied\r\nwith living streams, and their irrigation can be readily effected, and\r\nto secure greater certainty and greater yield of crops irrigation will\r\nbe practiced in such places.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           IRRIGABLE LANDS.\r\n\r\nWithin the Arid Region only a small portion of the country is\r\nirrigable. These irrigable tracts are lowlands lying along the streams.\r\nOn the mountains and high plateaus forests are found at elevations so\r\ngreat that frequent summer frosts forbid the cultivation of the soil.\r\nHere are the natural timber lands of the Arid Region--an upper region\r\nset apart by nature for the growth of timber necessary to the mining,\r\nmanufacturing, and agricultural industries of the country. Between the\r\nlow irrigable lands and the elevated forest lands there are valleys,\r\nmesas, hills, and mountain slopes bearing grasses of greater or less\r\nvalue for pasturage purposes.\r\n\r\nThen, in discussing the lands of the Arid Region, three great classes\r\nare recognized--the irrigable lands below, the forest lands above, and\r\nthe pasturage lands between. In order to set forth the characteristics\r\nof these lands and the conditions under which they can be most\r\nprofitably utilized, it is deemed best to discuss first a somewhat\r\nlimited region in detail as a fair type of the whole. The survey under\r\nthe direction of the writer has been extended over the greater part of\r\nUtah, a small part of Wyoming and Colorado, the northern portion of\r\nArizona, and a small part of Nevada, but it is proposed to take up for\r\nthis discussion only the area embraced in Utah Territory.\r\n\r\nIn Utah Territory agriculture is dependent upon irrigation. To this\r\nstatement there are some small exceptions. In the more elevated regions\r\nthere are tracts of meadow land from which small crops of hay can be\r\ntaken: such lands being at higher altitudes need less moisture, and\r\nat the same time receive a greater amount of rainfall because of the\r\naltitude; but these meadows have been, often are, and in future will\r\nbe, still more improved by irrigation. Again, on the belt of country\r\nlying between Great Salt Lake and the Wasatch Mountains the local\r\nrainfall is much greater than the general rainfall of the region.\r\nThe water evaporated from the lake is carried by the westerly winds\r\nto the adjacent mountains on the east and again condensed, and the\r\nrainfall thus produced extends somewhat beyond the area occupied by the\r\nmountains, so that the foot hills and contiguous bench lands receive\r\na modicum of this special supply. In some seasons this additional\r\nsupply is enough to water the lands for remunerative agriculture, but\r\nthe crops grown will usually be very small, and they will be subject\r\nto seasons of extreme drought, when all agriculture will result in\r\nfailure. Most of these lands can be irrigated, and doubtless will be,\r\nfrom a consideration of the facts already stated, namely, that crops\r\nwill thereby be greatly increased and immunity from drought secured.\r\nPerhaps other small tracts, on account of their subsoils, can be\r\nprofitably cultivated in favorable seasons, but all of these exceptions\r\nare small, and the fact remains that agriculture is there dependent\r\nupon irrigation. Only a small part of the territory, however, can be\r\nredeemed, as high, rugged mountains and elevated plateaus occupy much\r\nof its area, and these regions are so elevated that summer frosts\r\nforbid their occupation by the farmer. Thus thermic conditions limit\r\nagriculture to the lowlands, and here another limit is found in the\r\nsupply of water. Some of the large streams run in deep gorges so far\r\nbelow the general surface of the country that they cannot be used; for\r\nexample, the Colorado River runs through the southeastern portion of\r\nthe Territory and carries a great volume of water, but no portion of\r\nit can be utilized within the Territory from the fact that its channel\r\nis so much below the adjacent lands. The Bear River, in the northern\r\npart of the Territory, runs in a somewhat narrow valley, so that only\r\na portion of its waters can be utilized. Generally the smaller streams\r\ncan be wholly employed in agriculture, but the lands which might thus\r\nbe reclaimed are of greater extent than the amount which the streams\r\ncan serve; hence in all such regions the extent of irrigable land is\r\ndependent upon the volume of water carried by the streams.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the amount of irrigable land in Utah it was\r\nnecessary to determine the areas to which the larger streams can be\r\ntaken by proper engineering skill, and the amount which the smaller\r\nstreams can serve. In the latter case it was necessary to determine\r\nfirst the amount of land which a given amount or unit of water would\r\nsupply, and then the volume of water running in the streams; the\r\nproduct of these factors giving the extent of the irrigable lands. A\r\ncontinuous flow of one cubic foot of water per second was taken as the\r\nunit, and after careful consideration it was assumed that this unit of\r\nwater will serve from 80 to 100 acres of land. Usually the computations\r\nhave been made on the basis of 100 acres. This unit was determined in\r\nthe most practical way--from the experience of the farmers of Utah who\r\nhave been practicing agriculture for the past thirty years. Many of\r\nthe farmers will not admit that so great a tract can be cultivated by\r\nthis unit. In the early history of irrigation in this country the lands\r\nwere oversupplied with water, but experience has shown that irrigation\r\nis most successful when the least amount of water is used necessary to\r\na vigorous growth of the crops; that is, a greater yield is obtained\r\nby avoiding both scanty and excessive watering; but the tendency to\r\noverwater the lands is corrected only by extended experience. A great\r\nmany of the waterways are so rudely constructed that much waste ensues.\r\nAs irrigating methods are improved this wastage will be avoided; so in\r\nassuming that a cubic foot of water will irrigate from 80 to 100 acres\r\nof land it is at the same time assumed that only the necessary amount\r\nof water will be used, and that the waterways will eventually be so\r\nconstructed that the waste now almost universal will be prevented.\r\n\r\nIn determining the volume of water flowing in the streams great\r\naccuracy has not been attained. For this purpose it would be necessary\r\nto make continuous daily, or even hourly, observations for a series of\r\nyears on each stream, but by the methods described in the following\r\nchapters it will be seen that a fair approximation to a correct amount\r\nhas been made. For the degree of accuracy reached much is due to the\r\nfact that many of the smaller streams are already used to their fullest\r\ncapacity, and thus experience has solved the problem.\r\n\r\nHaving determined from the operations of irrigation that one cubic foot\r\nper second of water will irrigate from 80 to 100 acres of land when the\r\ngreatest economy is used, and having determined the volume of water\r\nor number of cubic feet per second flowing in the several streams of\r\nUtah by the most thorough methods available under the circumstances,\r\nit appears that within the territory, excluding a small portion in the\r\nsoutheastern corner where the survey has not yet been completed, the\r\namount of land which it is possible to redeem by this method is about\r\n2,262 square miles, or 1,447,920 acres. Of course this amount does not\r\nlie in a continuous body, but is scattered in small tracts along the\r\nwater courses. For the purpose of exhibiting their situations a map\r\nof the territory has been prepared, and will be found accompanying\r\nthis report, on which the several tracts of irrigable lands have been\r\ncolored. A glance at this map will show how they are distributed.\r\nExcluding that small portion of the territory in the southeast corner\r\nnot embraced in the map, Utah has an area of 80,000 square miles, of\r\nwhich 2,262 square miles are irrigable. That is, 2.8 per cent. of\r\nthe lands under consideration can be cultivated by utilizing all the\r\navailable streams during the irrigating season.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the streams considered in this statement there are\r\nnumerous small springs on the mountain sides scattered throughout the\r\nterritory--springs which do not feed permanent streams; and if their\r\nwaters were used for irrigation the extent of irrigable land would be\r\nslightly increased; to what exact amount cannot be stated, but the\r\ndifference would be so small as not to materially affect the general\r\nstatement, and doubtless these springs can be used in another way and\r\nto a better purpose, as will hereafter appear.\r\n\r\nThis statement of the facts relating to the irrigable lands of Utah\r\nwill serve to give a clearer conception of the extent and condition of\r\nthe irrigable lands throughout the Arid Region. Such as can be redeemed\r\nare scattered along the water courses, and are in general the lowest\r\nlands of the several districts to which they belong. In some of the\r\nstates and territories the percentage of irrigable land is less than in\r\nUtah, in others greater, and it is probable that the percentage in the\r\nentire region is somewhat greater than in the territory which we have\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nThe Arid Region is somewhat more than four-tenths of the total area of\r\nthe United States, and as the agricultural interests of so great an\r\narea are dependent upon irrigation it will be interesting to consider\r\ncertain questions relating to the economy and practicability of\r\ndistributing the waters over the lands to be redeemed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ADVANTAGES OF IRRIGATION.\r\n\r\nThere are two considerations that make irrigation attractive to\r\nthe agriculturist. Crops thus cultivated are not subject to the\r\nvicissitudes of rainfall; the farmer fears no droughts; his labors\r\nare seldom interrupted and his crops rarely injured by storms. This\r\nimmunity from drought and storm renders agricultural operations much\r\nmore certain than in regions of greater humidity. Again, the water\r\ncomes down from the mountains and plateaus freighted with fertilizing\r\nmaterials derived from the decaying vegetation and soils of the upper\r\nregions, which are spread by the flowing water over the cultivated\r\nlands. It is probable that the benefits derived from this source alone\r\nwill be full compensation for the cost of the process. Hitherto these\r\nbenefits have not been fully realized, from the fact that the methods\r\nemployed have been more or less crude. When the flow of water over the\r\nland is too great or too rapid the fertilizing elements borne in the\r\nwaters are carried past the fields, and a washing is produced which\r\ndeprives the lands irrigated of their most valuable elements, and\r\nlittle streams cut the fields with channels injurious in diverse ways.\r\nExperience corrects these errors, and the irrigator soon learns to\r\nflood his lands gently, evenly, and economically. It may be anticipated\r\nthat all the lands redeemed by irrigation in the Arid Region will be\r\nhighly cultivated and abundantly productive, and agriculture will\r\nbe but slightly subject to the vicissitudes of scant and excessive\r\nrainfall.\r\n\r\nA stranger entering this Arid Region is apt to conclude that the soils\r\nare sterile, because of their chemical composition, but experience\r\ndemonstrates the fact that all the soils are suitable for agricultural\r\npurposes when properly supplied with water. It is true that some of the\r\nsoils are overcharged with alkaline materials, but these can in time be\r\n“washed out”. Altogether the fact suggests that far too much attention\r\nhas heretofore been paid to the chemical constitution of soils and\r\ntoo little to those physical conditions by which moisture and air are\r\nsupplied to the roots of the growing plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n     COÖPERATIVE LABOR OR CAPITAL NECESSARY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF\r\n                              IRRIGATION.\r\n\r\nSmall streams can be taken out and distributed by individual\r\nenterprise, but coöperative labor or aggregated capital must be\r\nemployed in taking out the larger streams.\r\n\r\nThe diversion of a large stream from its channel into a system of\r\ncanals demands a large outlay of labor and material. To repay this all\r\nthe waters so taken out must be used, and large tracts of land thus\r\nbecome dependent upon a single canal. It is manifest that a farmer\r\ndepending upon his own labor cannot undertake this task. To a great\r\nextent the small streams are already employed, and but a comparatively\r\nsmall portion of the irrigable lands can be thus redeemed; hence the\r\nchief future development of irrigation must come from the use of the\r\nlarger streams. Usually the confluence of the brooks and creeks which\r\nform a large river takes place within the mountain district which\r\nfurnishes its source before the stream enters the lowlands where\r\nthe waters are to be used. The volume of water carried by the small\r\nstreams that reach the lowlands before uniting with the great rivers,\r\nor before they are lost in the sands, is very small when compared with\r\nthe volume of the streams which emerge from the mountains as rivers.\r\nThis fact is important. If the streams could be used along their upper\r\nramifications while the several branches are yet small, poor men could\r\noccupy the lands, and by their individual enterprise the agriculture of\r\nthe country would be gradually extended to the limit of the capacity\r\nof the region; but when farming is dependent upon larger streams such\r\nmen are barred from these enterprises until coöperative labor can be\r\norganized or capital induced to assist. Before many years all the\r\navailable smaller streams throughout the entire region will be occupied\r\nin serving the lands, and then all future development will depend on\r\nthe conditions above described.\r\n\r\nIn Utah Territory coöperative labor, under ecclesiastical organization,\r\nhas been very successful. Outside of Utah there are but few instances\r\nwhere it has been tried; but at Greeley, in the State of Colorado, this\r\nsystem has been eminently successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE USE OF SMALLER STREAMS SOMETIMES INTERFERES WITH THE USE OF THE\r\n                                LARGER.\r\n\r\nA river emerging from a mountain region and meandering through a valley\r\nmay receive small tributaries along its valley course. These small\r\nstreams will usually be taken out first, and the lands which they will\r\nbe made to serve will often lie low down in the valley, because the\r\nwaters can be more easily controlled here and because the lands are\r\nbetter; and this will be done without regard to the subsequent use of\r\nthe larger stream to which the smaller ones are tributary. But when the\r\ntime comes to take out the larger stream, it is found that the lands\r\nwhich it can be made to serve lying adjacent on either hand are already\r\nin part served by the smaller streams, and as it will not pay to take\r\nout the larger stream without using all of its water, and as the people\r\nwho use the smaller streams have already vested rights in these lands,\r\na practical prohibition is placed upon the use of the larger river.\r\nIn Utah, church authority, to some extent at least, adjusts these\r\nconflicting interests by causing the smaller streams to be taken out\r\nhigher up in their course. Such adjustment is not so easily attained\r\nby the great body of people settling in the Rocky Mountain Region, and\r\nsome provision against this difficulty is an immediate necessity. It is\r\na difficulty just appearing, but in the future it will be one of great\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n          INCREASE OF IRRIGABLE AREA BY THE STORAGE OF WATER.\r\n\r\nWithin the Arid Region great deposits of gold, silver, iron, coal,\r\nand many other minerals are found, and the rapid development of these\r\nmining industries will demand _pari passu_ a rapid development of\r\nagriculture. Thus all the lands that can be irrigated will be required\r\nfor agricultural products necessary to supply the local market created\r\nby the mines. For this purpose the waters of the non-growing season\r\nwill be stored, that they may be used in the growing season.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of storing the waste waters. Reservoirs may be\r\nconstructed near the sources of the streams and the waters held in\r\nthe upper valleys, or the water may be run from the canals into ponds\r\nwithin or adjacent to the district where irrigation is practiced.\r\nThis latter method will be employed first. It is already employed to\r\nsome extent where local interests demand and favorable opportunities\r\nare afforded. In general, the opportunities for ponding water in this\r\nway are infrequent, as the depressions where ponds can easily be made\r\nare liable to be so low that the waters cannot be taken from them to\r\nthe adjacent lands, but occasionally very favorable sites for such\r\nponds may be found. This is especially true near the mountains where\r\nalluvial cones have been formed at the debouchure of the streams\r\nfrom the mountain cañons. Just at the foot of the mountains are many\r\nplaces where ancient glaciation has left the general surface with many\r\ndepressions favorable to ponding.\r\n\r\nPonding in the lower region is somewhat wasteful of water, as the\r\nevaporation is greater than above, and the pond being more or less\r\nshallow a greater proportional surface for evaporation is presented.\r\nThis wastage is apparent when it is remembered that the evaporation in\r\nan arid climate may be from 60 to 80 inches annually, or even greater.\r\n\r\nMuch of the waste water comes down in the spring when the streams are\r\nhigh and before the growing crops demand a great supply. When this\r\nwater is stored the loss by evaporation will be small.\r\n\r\nThe greater storage of water must come from the construction of great\r\nreservoirs in the highlands where lateral valleys may be dammed and\r\nthe main streams conducted into them by canals. On most streams\r\nfavorable sites for such water works can be found. This subject cannot\r\nbe discussed at any length in a general way, from the fact that each\r\nstream presents problems peculiar to itself.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be very definitely stated to what extent irrigation can be\r\nincreased by the storage of water. The rainfall is much greater in\r\nthe mountain than in the valley districts. Much of this precipitation\r\nin the mountain districts falls as snow. The great snow banks are the\r\nreservoirs which hold the water for the growing seasons. Then the\r\nstreams are at flood tide; many go dry after the snows have been melted\r\nby the midsummer sun; hence they supply during the irrigating time much\r\nmore water than during the remainder of the year. During the fall and\r\nwinter the streams are small; in late spring and early summer they are\r\nvery large. A day’s flow at flood time is greater than a month’s flow\r\nat low water time. During the first part of the irrigating season less\r\nwater is needed, but during that same time the supply is greatest. The\r\nchief increase will come from the storage of this excess of water in\r\nthe early part of the irrigating season. The amount to be stored will\r\nthen be great, and the time of this storage will be so short that it\r\nwill be but little diminished by evaporation. The waters of the fall\r\nand winter are so small in amount that they will not furnish a great\r\nsupply, and the time for their storage will be so great that much will\r\nbe lost by evaporation. The increase by storage will eventually be\r\nimportant, and it would be wise to anticipate the time when it will be\r\nneeded by reserving sites for principal reservoirs and larger ponds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TIMBER LANDS.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Arid Region timber of value is found growing\r\nspontaneously on the higher plateaus and mountains. These timber\r\nregions are bounded above and below by lines which are very irregular,\r\ndue to local conditions. Above the upper line no timber grows because\r\nof the rigor of the climate, and below no timber grows because of\r\naridity. Both the upper and lower lines descend in passing from south\r\nto north; that is, the timber districts are found at a lower altitude\r\nin the northern portion of the Arid Region than in the southern. The\r\nforests are chiefly of pine, spruce, and fir, but the pines are of\r\nprincipal value. Below these timber regions, on the lower slopes of\r\nmountains, on the mesas and hills, low, scattered forests are often\r\nfound, composed mainly of dwarfed piñon pines and cedars. These stunted\r\nforests have some slight value for fuel, and even for fencing, but the\r\nforests of principal value are found in the Timber Region as above\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nPrimarily the growth of timber depends on climatic conditions--humidity\r\nand temperature. Where the temperature is higher, humidity must be\r\ngreater, and where the temperature is lower, humidity may be less.\r\nThese two conditions restrict the forests to the highlands, as above\r\nstated. Of the two factors involved in the growth of timber, that\r\nof the degree of humidity is of the first importance; the degree of\r\ntemperature affects the problem comparatively little, and for most of\r\nthe purposes of this discussion may be neglected. For convenience, all\r\nthese upper regions where conditions of temperature and humidity are\r\nfavorable to the growth of timber may be called the _timber regions_.\r\n\r\nNot all these highlands are alike covered with forests. The timber\r\nregions are only in part _areas of standing timber_. This limitation\r\nis caused by fire. Throughout the timber regions of all the arid land\r\nfires annually destroy larger or smaller districts of timber, now\r\nhere, now there, and this destruction is on a scale so vast that the\r\namount taken from the lands for industrial purposes sinks by comparison\r\ninto insignificance. The cause of this great destruction is worthy\r\nof careful attention. The conditions under which these fires rage\r\nare climatic. Where the rainfall is great and extreme droughts are\r\ninfrequent, forests grow without much interruption from fires; but\r\nbetween that degree of humidity necessary for their protection, and\r\nthat smaller degree necessary to growth, all lands are swept bare by\r\nfire to an extent which steadily increases from the more humid to the\r\nmore arid districts, until at last all forests are destroyed, though\r\nthe humidity is still sufficient for their growth if immunity from\r\nfire were secured. The amount of mean annual rainfall necessary to the\r\ngrowth of forests if protected from fire is probably about the same as\r\nthe amount necessary for agriculture without irrigation; at any rate,\r\nit is somewhere from 20 to 24 inches. All timber growth below that\r\namount is of a character so stunted as to be of little value, and the\r\ngrowth is so slow that, when once the timber has been taken from the\r\ncountry, the time necessary for a new forest growth is so great that no\r\npractical purpose is subserved.\r\n\r\nThe evidence that the growth of timber, if protected from fires,\r\nmight be extended to the limits here given is abundant. It is a\r\nmatter of experience that planted forests thus protected will thrive\r\nthroughout the prairie region and far westward on the Great Plains.\r\nIn the mountain region it may be frequently observed that forest\r\ntrees grow low down on the mountain slopes and in the higher valleys\r\nwherever local circumstances protect them from fires, as in the case\r\nof rocky lands that give insufficient footing to the grass and shrubs\r\nin which fires generally spread. These cases must not be confounded\r\nwith those patches of forest that grow on alluvial cones where rivers\r\nleave mountain cañons and enter valleys or plains. Here the streams,\r\nclogged by the material washed from the adjacent mountains by storms,\r\nare frequently turned from their courses and divided into many\r\nchannels running near the surface. Thus a subterranean watering is\r\neffected favorable to the growth of trees, as their roots penetrate to\r\nsufficient depth. Usually this watering is too deep for agriculture, so\r\nthat forests grow on lands that cannot be cultivated without irrigation.\r\n\r\nFire is the immediate cause of the lack of timber on the prairies,\r\nthe eastern portion of the Great Plains, and on some portions of the\r\nhighlands of the Arid Region; but fires obtain their destructive force\r\nthrough climatic conditions, so that directly and remotely climate\r\ndetermines the growth of all forests. Within the region where prairies,\r\ngroves, and forests appear, the local distribution of timber growth is\r\nchiefly dependent upon drainage and soil, a subject which needs not\r\nbe here discussed. Only a small portion of the Rocky Mountain Region\r\nis protected by climatic conditions from the invasion of fires, and a\r\nsufficiency of forests for the country depends upon the control which\r\ncan be obtained over that destructive agent. A glance at the map of\r\nUtah will exhibit the extent and distribution of the forest region\r\nthroughout that territory, and also show what portions of it are in\r\nfact occupied by standing timber. The _area of standing timber_, as\r\nexhibited on the map, is but a part of the Timber Region as there\r\nshown, and includes all of the timber, whether dense or scattered.\r\n\r\nNecessarily the area of standing timber has been generalized. It\r\nwas not found practicable to indicate the growth of timber in any\r\nrefined way by grading it, and by rejecting from the general area\r\nthe innumerable small open spaces. If the area of standing timber\r\nwere considered by acres, and all acres not having timber valuable\r\nfor milling purposes rejected, the extent would be reduced at least\r\nto one-fourth of that colored. Within the territory represented on\r\nthe map the Timber Region has an extent of 18,500 square miles; that\r\nis, 23 per cent. belongs to the Timber Region. The general area of\r\nstanding timber is about 10,000 square miles, or 12.5 per cent. of\r\nthe entire area. The area of milling timber, determined in the more\r\nrefined way indicated above, is about 2,500 square miles, or 3¹⁄₈ per\r\ncent. of the area embraced on the map. In many portions of the Arid\r\nRegion these percentages are much smaller. This is true of southern\r\nCalifornia, Nevada, southern Arizona, and Idaho. In other regions the\r\npercentages are larger. Utah gives about a fair average. In general it\r\nmay be stated that the timber regions are fully adequate to the growth\r\nof all the forests which the industrial interests of the country will\r\nrequire if they can be protected from desolation by fire. No limitation\r\nto the use of the forests need be made. The amount which the citizens\r\nof the country will require will bear but a small proportion to the\r\namount which the fires will destroy; and if the fires are prevented,\r\nthe renewal by annual growth will more than replace that taken by\r\nman. The protection of the forests of the entire Arid Region of the\r\nUnited States is reduced to one single problem--Can these forests be\r\nsaved from fire? The writer has witnessed two fires in Colorado, each\r\nof which destroyed more timber than all that used by the citizens of\r\nthat State from its settlement to the present day; and at least three\r\nin Utah, each of which has destroyed more timber than that taken by\r\nthe people of the territory since its occupation. Similar fires have\r\nbeen witnessed by other members of the surveying corps. Everywhere\r\nthroughout the Rocky Mountain Region the explorer away from the beaten\r\npaths of civilization meets with great areas of dead forests; pines\r\nwith naked arms and charred trunks attesting to the former presence of\r\nthis great destroyer. The younger forests are everywhere beset with\r\nfallen timber, attesting to the rigor of the flames, and in seasons of\r\ngreat drought the mountaineer sees the heavens filled with clouds of\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\nIn the main these fires are set by Indians. Driven from the lowlands\r\nby advancing civilization, they resort to the higher regions until\r\nthey are forced back by the deep snows of winter. Want, caused by\r\nthe restricted area to which they resort for food; the desire for\r\nluxuries to which they were strangers in their primitive condition, and\r\nespecially the desire for personal adornment, together with a supply\r\nof more effective instruments for hunting and trapping, have in late\r\nyears, during the rapid settlement of the country since the discovery\r\nof gold and the building of railroads, greatly stimulated the pursuit\r\nof animals for their furs--the wealth and currency of the savage. On\r\ntheir hunting excursions they systematically set fire to forests for\r\nthe purpose of driving the game. This is a fact well known to all\r\nmountaineers. Only the white hunters of the region properly understand\r\nwhy these fires are set, it being usually attributed to a wanton\r\ndesire on the part of the Indians to destroy that which is of value to\r\nthe white man. The fires can, then, be very greatly curtailed by the\r\nremoval of the Indians.\r\n\r\nThese forest regions are made such by inexorable climatic conditions.\r\nThey are high among the summer frosts. The plateaus are scored by deep\r\ncañons, and the mountains are broken with crags and peaks. Perhaps at\r\nsome distant day a hardy people will occupy little glens and mountain\r\nvalleys, and wrest from an unwilling soil a scanty subsistence among\r\nthe rigors of a sub-arctic climate. Herdsmen having homes below may\r\nin the summer time drive their flocks to the higher lands to crop the\r\nscanty herbage. Where mines are found mills will be erected and little\r\ntowns spring up, but in general habitations will be remote. The forests\r\nwill be dense here or scattered there, as the trees may with ease or\r\ndifficulty gain a foothold, but the forest regions will remain such, to\r\nbe stripped of timber here and there from time to time to supply the\r\nwants of the people who live below; but once protected from fires, the\r\nforests will increase in extent and value. The first step to be taken\r\nfor their protection must be by prohibiting the Indians from resorting\r\nthereto for hunting purposes, and then slowly, as the lower country\r\nis settled, the grasses and herbage of the highlands, in which fires\r\ngenerally spread, will be kept down by summer pasturage, and the dead\r\nand fallen timber will be removed to supply the wants of people below.\r\nThis protection, though sure to come at last, will be tardy, for it\r\ndepends upon the gradual settlement of the country; and this again\r\ndepends upon the development of the agricultural and mineral resources\r\nand the establishment of manufactories, and to a very important extent\r\non the building of railroads, for the whole region is so arid that its\r\nstreams are small, and so elevated above the level of the sea that its\r\nfew large streams descend too rapidly for navigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n          AGRICULTURAL AND TIMBER INDUSTRIES DIFFERENTIATED.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that the irrigable lands are more or less remote\r\nfrom the timber lands; and as the larger streams are employed for\r\nirrigation, in the future the extended settlements will be still\r\nfarther away. The pasturage lands that in a general way intervene\r\nbetween the irrigable and timber lands have a scanty supply of\r\ndwarfed forests, as already described, and the people in occupying\r\nthese lands will not resort, to any great extent, to the mountains for\r\ntimber; hence timber and agricultural enterprises will be more or less\r\ndifferentiated; lumbermen and woodmen will furnish to the people below\r\ntheir supply of building and fencing material and fuel. In some cases\r\nit will be practicable for the farmers to own their timber lands, but\r\nin general the timber will be too remote, and from necessity such a\r\ndivision of labor will ensue.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CULTIVATION OF TIMBER.\r\n\r\nIn the irrigable districts much timber will be cultivated along the\r\ncanals and minor waterways. It is probable that in time a sufficient\r\namount will thus be raised to supply the people of the irrigable\r\ndistricts with fuel wherever such fuel is needed, but often such a\r\nwant will not exist, for in the Rocky Mountain Region there is a great\r\nabundance of lignitic coals that may be cheaply mined. All these coals\r\nare valuable for domestic purposes, and many superior grades are found.\r\nThese coals are not uniformly distributed, but generally this source of\r\nfuel is ample.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PASTURAGE LANDS.\r\n\r\nThe irrigable lands and timber lands constitute but a small fraction\r\nof the Arid Region. Between the lowlands on the one hand and the\r\nhighlands on the other is found a great body of valley, mesa, hill,\r\nand low mountain lands. To what extent, and under what conditions\r\ncan they be utilized? Usually they bear a scanty growth of grasses.\r\nThese grasses are nutritious and valuable both for summer and winter\r\npasturage. Their value depends upon peculiar climatic conditions;\r\nthe grasses grow to a great extent in scattered bunches, and mature\r\nseeds in larger proportion perhaps than the grasses of the more humid\r\nregions. In general the winter aridity is so great that the grasses\r\nwhen touched by the frosts are not washed down by the rains and snows\r\nto decay on the moist soil, but stand firmly on the ground all winter\r\nlong and “cure”, forming a _quasi_ uncut hay. Thus the grass lands are\r\nof value both in summer and winter. In a broad way, the greater or\r\nlesser abundance of the grasses is dependent on latitude and altitude;\r\nthe higher the latitude the better are the grasses, and they improve\r\nas the altitude increases. In very low altitudes and latitudes the\r\ngrasses are so scant as to be of no value; here the true deserts are\r\nfound. These conditions obtain in southern California, southern Nevada,\r\nsouthern Arizona, and southern New Mexico, where broad reaches of land\r\nare naked of vegetation, but in ascending to the higher lands the grass\r\nsteadily improves. Northward the deserts soon disappear, and the grass\r\nbecomes more and more luxuriant to our northern boundary. In addition\r\nto the desert lands mentioned, other large deductions must be made from\r\nthe area of the pasturage lands. There are many districts in which the\r\n“country rock” is composed of incoherent sands and clays; sometimes\r\nsediments of ancient Tertiary lakes; elsewhere sediments of more\r\nancient Cretaceous seas. In these districts perennial or intermittent\r\nstreams have carved deep waterways, and the steep hills are ever washed\r\nnaked by fierce but infrequent storms, as the incoherent rocks are\r\nunable to withstand the beating of the rain. These districts are known\r\nas the _mauvaises terres_ or bad lands of the Rocky Mountain Region.\r\nIn other areas the streams have carved labyrinths of deep gorges and\r\nthe waters flow at great depths below the general surface. The lands\r\nbetween the streams are beset with towering cliffs, and the landscape\r\nis an expanse of naked rock. These are the alcove lands and cañon lands\r\nof the Rocky Mountain Region. Still other districts have been the\r\ntheater of late volcanic activity, and broad sheets of naked lava are\r\nfound; cinder cones are frequent, and scoria and ashes are scattered\r\nover the land. These are the lava-beds of the Rocky Mountain Region. In\r\nyet other districts, low broken mountains are found with rugged spurs\r\nand craggy crests. Grasses and chaparral grow among the rocks, but such\r\nmountains are of little value for pasturage purposes.\r\n\r\nAfter making all the deductions, there yet remain vast areas of\r\nvaluable pasturage land bearing nutritious but scanty grass. The lands\r\nalong the creeks and rivers have been relegated to that class which\r\nhas been described as irrigable, hence the lands under consideration\r\nare away from the permanent streams. No rivers sweep over them and no\r\ncreeks meander among their hills.\r\n\r\nThough living water is not abundant, the country is partially supplied\r\nby scattered springs, that often feed little brooks whose waters\r\nnever join the great rivers on their way to the sea, being able to\r\nrun but a short distance from their fountains, when they spread among\r\nthe sands to be reëvaporated. These isolated springs and brooks will\r\nin many cases furnish the water necessary for the herds that feed on\r\nthe grasses. When springs are not found wells may be sometimes dug,\r\nand where both springs and wells fail reservoirs may be constructed.\r\nWherever grass grows water may be found or saved from the rains in\r\nsufficient quantities for all the herds that can live on the pasturage.\r\n\r\n\r\n         PASTURAGE FARMS NEED SMALL TRACTS OF IRRIGABLE LAND.\r\n\r\nThe men engaged in stock raising need small areas of irrigable lands\r\nfor gardens and fields where agricultural products can be raised for\r\ntheir own consumption, and where a store of grain and hay may be raised\r\nfor their herds when pressed by the severe storms by which the country\r\nis sometimes visited. In many places the lone springs and streams are\r\nsufficient for these purposes. Another and larger source of water for\r\nthe fertilization of the gardens and fields of the pasturage farms is\r\nfound in the smaller branches and upper ramifications of the larger\r\nirrigating streams. These brooks can be used to better advantage for\r\nthe pasturage farms as a supply of water for stock gardens and small\r\nfields than for farms where agriculture by irrigation is the only\r\nindustry. The springs and brooks of the permanent drainage can be\r\nemployed in making farms attractive and profitable where large herds\r\nmay be raised in many great districts throughout the Rocky Mountain\r\nRegion.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which these pasturage lands can be employed are\r\nworthy of consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE FARM UNIT FOR PASTURAGE LANDS.\r\n\r\nThe grass is so scanty that the herdsman must have a large area for the\r\nsupport of his stock. In general a quarter section of land alone is of\r\nno value to him; the pasturage it affords is entirely inadequate to the\r\nwants of a herd that the poorest man needs for his support.\r\n\r\nFour square miles may be considered as the minimum amount necessary\r\nfor a pasturage farm, and a still greater amount is necessary for\r\nthe larger part of the lands; that is, pasturage farms, to be of\r\nany practicable value, must be of at least 2,560 acres, and in many\r\ndistricts they must be much larger.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] For the determination of the proper unit for pasturage farms the\r\nwriter has conferred with many persons living in the Rocky Mountain\r\nRegion who have had experience. His own observations have been\r\nextensive, and for many years while conducting surveys and making long\r\njourneys through the Arid Region this question has been uppermost in\r\nhis mind. He fears that this estimate will disappoint many of his\r\nwestern friends, who will think he has placed the minimum too low, but\r\nafter making the most thorough examination of the subject possible he\r\nbelieves the amount to be sufficient for the best pasturage lands,\r\nespecially such as are adjacent to the minor streams of the general\r\ndrainage, and when these have been taken by actual settlers the size of\r\nthe pasturage farms may be increased as experience proves necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n      REGULAR DIVISION LINES FOR PASTURAGE FARMS NOT PRACTICABLE.\r\n\r\nMany a brook which runs but a short distance will afford sufficient\r\nwater for a number of pasturage farms; but if the lands are surveyed in\r\nregular tracts as square miles or townships, all the water sufficient\r\nfor a number of pasturage farms may fall entirely within one division.\r\nIf the lands are thus surveyed, only the divisions having water will\r\nbe taken, and the farmer obtaining title to such a division or farm\r\ncould practically occupy all the country adjacent by owning the water\r\nnecessary to its use. For this reason divisional surveys should conform\r\nto the topography, and be so made as to give the greatest number of\r\nwater fronts. For example, a brook carrying water sufficient for\r\nthe irrigation of 200 acres of land might be made to serve for the\r\nirrigation of 20 acres to each of ten farms, and also supply the water\r\nfor all the stock that could live on ten pasturage farms, and ten small\r\nfarmers could have homes. But if the water was owned by one man, nine\r\nwould be excluded from its benefits and nine-tenths of the land remain\r\nin the hands of the government.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  FARM RESIDENCES SHOULD BE GROUPED.\r\n\r\nThese lands will maintain but a scanty population. The homes must\r\nnecessarily be widely scattered from the fact that the farm unit\r\nmust be large. That the inhabitants of these districts may have the\r\nbenefits of the local social organizations of civilization--as schools,\r\nchurches, etc., and the benefits of coöperation in the construction of\r\nroads, bridges, and other local improvements, it is essential that the\r\nresidences should be grouped to the greatest possible extent. This may\r\nbe practically accomplished by making the pasturage farms conform to\r\ntopographic features in such manner as to give the greatest possible\r\nnumber of water fronts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   PASTURAGE LANDS CANNOT BE FENCED.\r\n\r\nThe great areas over which stock must roam to obtain subsistence\r\nusually prevents the practicability of fencing the lands. It will\r\nnot pay to fence the pasturage fields, hence in many cases the lands\r\nmust be occupied by herds roaming in common; for poor men coöperative\r\npasturage is necessary, or communal regulations for the occupancy of\r\nthe ground and for the division of the increase of the herds. Such\r\ncommunal regulations have already been devised in many parts of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            RECAPITULATION.\r\n\r\nThe Arid Region of the United States is more than four-tenths of the\r\narea of the entire country excluding Alaska.\r\n\r\nIn the Arid Region there are three classes of lands, namely, irrigable\r\nlands, timber lands, and pasturage lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           IRRIGABLE LANDS.\r\n\r\nWithin the Arid Region agriculture is dependent upon irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe amount of irrigable land is but a small percentage of the whole\r\narea.\r\n\r\nThe chief development of irrigation depends upon the use of the large\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nFor the use of large streams coöperative labor or capital is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe small streams should not be made to serve lands so as to interfere\r\nwith the use of the large streams.\r\n\r\nSites for reservoirs should be set apart, in order that no hinderance\r\nmay be placed upon the increase of irrigation by the storage of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TIMBER LANDS.\r\n\r\nThe timber regions are on the elevated plateaus and mountains.\r\n\r\nThe timber regions constitute from 20 to 25 per cent. of the Arid\r\nRegion.\r\n\r\nThe area of standing timber is much less than the timber region, as the\r\nforests have been partially destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nThe timber regions cannot be used as farming lands; they are valuable\r\nfor forests only.\r\n\r\nTo preserve the forests they must be protected from fire. This will be\r\nlargely accomplished by removing the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe amount of timber used for economic purposes will be more than\r\nreplaced by the natural growth.\r\n\r\nIn general the timber is too far from the agricultural lands to be\r\nowned and utilized directly by those who carry on farming by irrigation.\r\n\r\nA division of labor is necessary, and special timber industries will be\r\ndeveloped, and hence the timber lands must be controlled by lumbermen\r\nand woodmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PASTURAGE LANDS.\r\n\r\nThe grasses of the pasturage lands are scant, and the lands are of\r\nvalue only in large quantities.\r\n\r\nThe farm unit should not be less than 2,560 acres.\r\n\r\nPasturage farms need small tracts of irrigable land; hence the small\r\nstreams of the general drainage system and the lone springs and streams\r\nshould be reserved for such pasturage farms.\r\n\r\nThe division of these lands should be controlled by topographic\r\nfeatures in such manner as to give the greatest number of water fronts\r\nto the pasturage farms.\r\n\r\nResidences of the pasturage farms should be grouped, in order to secure\r\nthe benefits of local social organizations, and coöperation in public\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nThe pasturage lands will not usually be fenced, and hence herds must\r\nroam in common.\r\n\r\nAs the pasturage lands should have water fronts and irrigable tracts,\r\nand as the residences should be grouped, and as the lands cannot\r\nbe economically fenced and must be kept in common, local communal\r\nregulations or coöperation is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n              THE LAND SYSTEM NEEDED FOR THE ARID REGION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe growth and prosperity of the Arid Region will depend largely upon a\r\nland system which will comply with the requirements of the conditions\r\nand facts briefly set forth in the former chapter.\r\n\r\nAny citizen of the United States may acquire title to public lands by\r\npurchase at public sale or by ordinary “private entry”, and in virtue\r\nof preëmption, homestead, timber culture, and desert land laws.\r\n\r\nPurchase at public sale may be effected when the lands are offered at\r\npublic auction to the highest bidder, either pursuant to proclamation\r\nby the President or public notice given in accordance with instructions\r\nfrom the General Land Office. If the land is thus offered and\r\npurchasers are not found, they are then subject to “private entry” at\r\nthe rate of $1.25 or $2.50 per acre. For a number of years it has not\r\nbeen the practice of the Government to dispose of the public lands by\r\nthese methods; but the public lands of the southern states are now, or\r\nsoon will be, thus offered for sale.\r\n\r\nAny citizen may preëmpt 160 acres of land, and by settling thereon,\r\nerecting a dwelling, and making other improvements, and by paying $1.25\r\nper acre in some districts, without the boundaries of railroad grants,\r\nand $2.50 within the boundaries of railroad grants in others, may\r\nacquire title thereto. The preëmption right can be exercised but once.\r\nNo person can exercise the preëmption right who is already the owner of\r\n320 acres of land.\r\n\r\nAny citizen may, under the homestead privilege, obtain title to 160\r\nacres of land valued at $1.25 per acre, or 80 acres valued at the rate\r\nof $2.50, by payment of $5 in the first case and $10 in the last,\r\nand by residing on the land for the term of five years and by making\r\ncertain improvements.\r\n\r\nThe time of residence is shortened for persons who have served in the\r\narmy or navy of the United States, and any such person may homestead\r\n160 acres of land valued at $2.50 per acre.\r\n\r\nAny citizen may take advantage of both the homestead and preëmption\r\nprivileges.\r\n\r\nUnder the timber culture act, any citizen who is the head of a family\r\nmay acquire title to 160 acres of land in the prairie region by\r\ncultivating timber thereon in certain specific quantities; the title\r\ncan be acquired at the expiration of eight years from the date of entry.\r\n\r\nAny citizen may acquire title to one section of desert land (irrigable\r\nlands as described in this paper) by the payment at the time of entry\r\nof 25 cents per acre, and by redeeming the same by irrigation within\r\na period of three years and by the payment of $1 per acre at the\r\nexpiration of that time, and a patent will then issue.\r\n\r\nProvision is also made for the disposal of public lands as town sites.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time land warrants have been issued by the Government as\r\nbounties to soldiers and sailors, and for other purposes. These land\r\nwarrants have found their way into the market, and the owners thereof\r\nare entitled to enter Government lands in the quantities specified in\r\nthe warrants.\r\n\r\nAgricultural scrip has been issued for the purpose of establishing\r\nand endowing agricultural schools. A part of this scrip has been used\r\nby the schools in locating lands for investment. Much of the scrip\r\nhas found its way into the market and is used by private individuals.\r\nWarrants and scrip can be used when lands have been offered for sale,\r\nand preëmptors can use them in lieu of money.\r\n\r\nGrants of lands have been made to railroad and other companies, and as\r\nthese railroads have been completed in whole or in part, the companies\r\nhave obtained titles to the whole or proportional parts of the lands\r\nthus granted.\r\n\r\nWhere the railroads are unfinished the titles are inchoate to an extent\r\nproportional to the incomplete parts.\r\n\r\nWith small exceptions, the lands of the Arid Region have not been\r\noffered for sale at auction or by private entry.\r\n\r\nThe methods, then, by which the lands under consideration can be\r\nobtained from the Government are by taking advantage of the preëmption,\r\nhomestead, timber culture, or desert land privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           IRRIGABLE LANDS.\r\n\r\nBy these methods adequate provision is made for actual settlers on all\r\nirrigable lands that are dependent on the waters of minor streams; but\r\nthese methods are insufficient for the settlement of the irrigable\r\nlands that depend on the larger streams, and also for the pasturage\r\nlands and timber lands, and in this are included nearly all the lands\r\nof the Arid Region. If the irrigable lands are to be sold, it should\r\nbe in quantities to suit purchasers, and but one condition should be\r\nimposed, namely, that the lands should be actually irrigated before\r\nthe title is transferred to the purchaser. This method would provide\r\nfor the redemption of these lands by irrigation through the employment\r\nof capital. If these lands are to be reserved for actual settlers,\r\nin small quantities, to provide homes for poor men, on the principle\r\ninvolved in the homestead laws, a general law should be enacted under\r\nwhich a number of persons would be able to organize and settle on\r\nirrigable districts, and establish their own rules and regulations for\r\nthe use of the water and subdivision of the lands, but in obedience to\r\nthe general provisions of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TIMBER LANDS.\r\n\r\nThe timber lands cannot be acquired by any of the methods provided in\r\nthe preëmption, homestead, timber culture, and desert land laws, from\r\nthe fact that they are not agricultural lands. Climatic conditions\r\nmake these methods inoperative. Under these laws “dummy entries” are\r\nsometimes made. A man wishing to obtain the timber from a tract of land\r\nwill make homestead or preëmption entries by himself or through his\r\nemployés without intending to complete the titles, being able thus to\r\nhold these lands for a time sufficient to strip them of their timber.\r\n\r\nThis is thought to be excusable by the people of the country, as\r\ntimber is necessary for their industries, and the timber lands cannot\r\nhonestly be acquired by those who wish to engage in timber enterprises.\r\nProvision should be made by which the timber can be purchased by\r\npersons or companies desiring to engage in the lumber or wood\r\nbusiness, and in such quantities as may be necessary to encourage the\r\nconstruction of mills, the erection of flumes, the making of roads, and\r\nother improvements necessary to the utilization of the timber for the\r\nindustries of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PASTURAGE LANDS.\r\n\r\nIf divisional surveys were extended over the pasturage lands, favorable\r\nsites at springs and along small streams would be rapidly taken under\r\nthe homestead and preëmption privileges for the nuclei of pasturage\r\nfarms.\r\n\r\nUnentered lands contiguous to such pasturage farms could be controlled\r\nto a greater or less extent by those holding the water, and in this\r\nmanner the pasturage of the country would be rendered practicable.\r\nBut the great body of land would remain in the possession of the\r\nGovernment; the farmers owning the favorable spots could not obtain\r\npossession of the adjacent lands by homestead or preëmption methods,\r\nand if such adjacent lands were offered for sale, they could not afford\r\nto pay the Government price.\r\n\r\nCertain important facts relating to the pasturage farms may be\r\nadvantageously restated.\r\n\r\nThe farm unit should not be less than 2,560 acres; the pasturage farms\r\nneed small bodies of irrigable land; the division of these lands should\r\nbe controlled by topographic features to give water fronts; residences\r\nof the pasturage lands should be grouped; the pasturage farms cannot be\r\nfenced--they must be occupied in common.\r\n\r\nThe homestead and preëmption methods are inadequate to meet these\r\nconditions. A general law should be enacted to provide for the\r\norganization of pasturage districts, in which the residents should have\r\nthe right to make their own regulations for the division of the lands,\r\nthe use of the water for irrigation and for watering the stock, and for\r\nthe pasturage of the lands in common or in severalty. But each division\r\nor pasturage farm of the district should be owned by an individual;\r\nthat is, these lands could be settled and improved by the “colony” plan\r\nbetter than by any other. It should not be understood that the colony\r\nsystem applies only to such persons as migrate from the east in a body;\r\nany number of persons already in this region could thus organize. In\r\nfact very large bodies of these lands would be taken by people who are\r\nalready in the country and who have herds with which they roam about\r\nseeking water and grass, and making no permanent residences and no\r\nvaluable improvements. Such a plan would give immediate relief to all\r\nthese people.\r\n\r\nThis district or colony system is not untried in this country. It is\r\nessentially the basis of all the mining district organizations of the\r\nwest. Under it the local rules and regulations for the division of\r\nmining lands, the use of water, timber, etc., are managed better than\r\nthey could possibly be under specific statutes of the United States.\r\nThe association of a number of people prevents single individuals from\r\nhaving undue control of natural privileges, and secures an equitable\r\ndivision of mineral lands; and all this is secured in obedience to\r\nstatutes of the United States providing general regulations.\r\n\r\nCustoms are forming and regulations are being made by common consent\r\namong the people in some districts already; but these provide no means\r\nfor the acquirement of titles to land, no incentive is given to the\r\nimprovement of the country, and no legal security to pasturage rights.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the irrigable lands can be taken in quantities to suit\r\npurchasers, and the colony system provided for poor men who wish to\r\ncoöperate in this industry; if the timber lands are opened to timber\r\nenterprises, and the pasturage lands offered to settlement under a\r\ncolony plan like that indicated above, a land system would be provided\r\nfor the Arid Region adapted to the wants of all persons desiring to\r\nbecome actual settlers therein. Thousands of men who now own herds\r\nand live a semi-nomadic life; thousands of persons who now roam from\r\nmountain range to mountain range prospecting for gold, silver, and\r\nother minerals; thousands of men who repair to that country and return\r\ndisappointed from the fact that they are practically debarred from the\r\npublic lands; and thousands of persons in the eastern states without\r\nemployment, or discontented with the rewards of labor, would speedily\r\nfind homes in the great Rocky Mountain Region.\r\n\r\nIn making these recommendations, the wisdom and beneficence of the\r\nhomestead system have been recognized and the principles involved have\r\nbeen considered paramount.\r\n\r\nTo give more definite form to some of the recommendations for\r\nlegislation made above, two bills have been drawn, one relating to the\r\norganization of irrigation districts, the other to pasturage districts.\r\nThese bills are presented here. It is not supposed that these forms are\r\nthe best that could be adopted; perhaps they could be greatly improved;\r\nbut they have been carefully considered, and it is believed they embody\r\nthe recommendations made above.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BILL to authorize the organization of irrigation districts by\r\nhomestead settlements upon the public lands requiring irrigation for\r\nagricultural purposes.\r\n\r\n_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled_, That it shall be lawful for\r\nany nine or more persons who may be entitled to acquire a homestead\r\nfrom the public lands, as provided for in sections twenty-two hundred\r\nand eighty-nine to twenty-three hundred and seventeen, inclusive, of\r\nthe Revised Statutes of the United States, to settle an irrigation\r\ndistrict and to acquire titles to irrigable lands under the limitations\r\nand conditions hereinafter provided.\r\n\r\nSEC. 2.

If\r\nthe whole of the Arid Region was yet unsettled, it might be wise for\r\nthe Government to undertake the parceling of the lands and employ\r\nskilled engineers to do the work, whose duties could then be performed\r\nin advance of settlement. It is manifest that this work cannot be\r\nproperly performed under the contract system; it would be necessary to\r\nemploy persons of skill and judgment under a salary system. The mining\r\nindustries which have sprung up in the country since the discovery of\r\ngold on the Pacific coast, in 1849, have stimulated immigration, so\r\nthat settlements are scattered throughout the Arid Region; mining towns\r\nhave sprung up on the flanks of almost every great range of mountains,\r\nand adjacent valleys have been occupied by persons desiring to engage\r\nin agriculture. Many of the lands surveyed along the minor streams have\r\nbeen entered, and the titles to these lands are in the hands of actual\r\nsettlers. Many pasturage farms, or ranches, as they are called locally,\r\nhave been established throughout the country. These remarks are true\r\nof every state and territory in the Arid Region. In the main these\r\nranches or pasturage farms are on Government land, and the settlers are\r\nsquatters, and some are not expecting to make permanent homes. Many\r\nother persons have engaged in pasturage enterprises without having\r\nmade fixed residences, but move about from place to place with their\r\nherds. It is now too late for the Government to parcel the pasturage\r\nlands in advance of the wants of settlers in the most available way,\r\nso as to closely group residences and give water privileges to the\r\nseveral farms. Many of the settlers are actually on the ground, and are\r\nclamoring for some means by which they can obtain titles to pasturage\r\nfarms of an extent adequate to their wants, and the tens of thousands\r\nof individual interests would make the problem a difficult one for\r\nthe officers of the Government to solve. A system less arbitrary\r\nthan that of the rectangular surveys now in vogue, and requiring\r\nunbiased judgment, overlooking the interests of single individuals\r\nand considering only the interests of the greatest number, would meet\r\nwith local opposition. The surveyors themselves would be placed under\r\nmany temptations, and would be accused--sometimes rightfully perhaps,\r\nsometimes unjustly--of favoritism and corruption, and the service would\r\nbe subject to the false charges of disappointed men on the one hand,\r\nand to truthful charges against corrupt men on the other. In many ways\r\nit would be surrounded with difficulties and fall into disrepute.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it is believed that it is best to permit the\r\npeople to divide their lands for themselves--not in a way by which each\r\nman may take what he pleases for himself, but by providing methods by\r\nwhich these settlers may organize and mutually protect each other from\r\nthe rapacity of individuals. The lands, as lands, are of but slight\r\nvalue, as they cannot be used for ordinary agricultural purposes, _i.\r\ne._, the cultivation of crops; but their value consists in the scant\r\ngrasses which they spontaneously produce, and these values can be made\r\navailable only by the use of the waters necessary for the subsistence\r\nof stock, and that necessary for the small amount of irrigable land\r\nwhich should be attached to the several pasturage farms. Thus,\r\npractically, all values inhere in the water, and an equitable division\r\nof the waters can be made only by a wise system of parceling the lands;\r\nand the people in organized bodies can well be trussed with this right,\r\nwhile individuals could not thus be trusted. These considerations have\r\nled to the plan suggested in the bill submitted for the organization of\r\npasturage districts.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, in the bill designed for the purpose of suggesting a\r\nplan for the organization of irrigation districts, the same principle\r\nis involved, _viz_, that of permitting the settlers themselves to\r\nsubdivide the lands into such tracts as they may desire.\r\n\r\nThe lands along the streams are not valuable for agricultural purposes\r\nin continuous bodies or squares, but only in irrigable tracts governed\r\nby the levels of the meandering canals which carry the water for\r\nirrigation, and it would be greatly to the advantage of every such\r\ndistrict if the lands could be divided into parcels, governed solely by\r\nthe conditions under which the water could be distributed over them;\r\nand such parceling cannot be properly done prior to the occupancy\r\nof the lands, but can only be made pari passu with the adoption of a\r\nsystem of canals; and the people settling on these lands should be\r\nallowed the privilege of dividing the lands into such tracts as may be\r\nmost available for such purposes, and they should not be hampered with\r\nthe present arbitrary system of dividing the lands into rectangular\r\ntracts.\r\n\r\nThose who are acquainted with the history of the land system of the\r\neastern states, and know the difficulty of properly identifying or\r\ndetermining the boundaries of many of the parcels or tracts of land\r\ninto which the country is divided, and who appreciate the cumbrous\r\nmethod of describing such lands by metes and bounds in conveyances, may\r\nat first thought object to the plan of parceling lands into irregular\r\ntracts. They may fear that if the system of parceling the lands into\r\ntownships and sections, and describing the same in conveyances by\r\nreference to certain great initial points in the surveys of the lands,\r\nis abandoned, it will lead to the uncertainties and difficulties that\r\nbelonged to the old system. But the evils of that system did not belong\r\nto the shape into which the lands were divided. The lands were often\r\nnot definitely and accurately parceled; actual boundary lines were\r\nnot fixed on the ground and accurate plats were not made, and the\r\ndescription of the boundary lines was usually vague and uncertain.\r\nIt matters not what the shape of tracts or parcels may be; if these\r\nparcels are accurately defined by surveys on the ground and plotted for\r\nrecord, none of these uncertainties will arise, and if these tracts or\r\nparcels are lettered or numbered on the plats, they may be very easily\r\ndescribed in conveyances without entering into a long and tedious\r\ndescription of metes and bounds.\r\n\r\nIn most of our western towns and cities lots are accurately surveyed\r\nand plotted and described by number of lot, number of block, etc.,\r\netc., and such a simple method should be used in conveying the\r\npasturage lands. While the system of parceling and conveying by\r\nsection, township, range, etc., was a very great improvement on the\r\nsystem which previously existed, the much more simple method used in\r\nmost of our cities and towns would be a still further improvement.\r\n\r\nThe title to no tract of land should be conveyed from the Government\r\nto the individual until the proper survey of the same is made and the\r\nplat prepared for record. With this precaution, which the Government\r\nalready invariably takes in disposing of its lands, no fear of\r\nuncertainty of identification need be entertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             WATER RIGHTS.\r\n\r\nIn each of the suggested bills there is a clause providing that, with\r\ncertain restrictions, the right to the water necessary to irrigate\r\nany tract of land shall inhere in the land itself from the date of\r\nthe organization of the district. The object of this is to give\r\nsettlers on pasturage or irrigation farms the assurance that their\r\nlands shall not be made worthless by taking away the water to other\r\nlands by persons settling subsequently in adjacent portions of the\r\ncountry. The men of small means who under the theory of the bill are to\r\nreceive its benefits will need a few years in which to construct the\r\nnecessary waterways and bring their lands under cultivation. On the\r\nother hand, they should not be permitted to acquire rights to water\r\nwithout using the same. The construction of the waterways necessary to\r\nactual irrigation by the land owners may be considered as a sufficient\r\nguarantee that the waters will subsequently be used.\r\n\r\nThe general subject of water rights is one of great importance. In many\r\nplaces in the Arid Region irrigation companies are organized who obtain\r\nvested rights in the waters they control, and consequently the rights\r\nto such waters do not inhere in any particular tracts of land.\r\n\r\nWhen the area to which it is possible to take the water of any given\r\nstream is much greater than the stream is competent to serve, if the\r\nland titles and water rights are severed, the owner of any tract of\r\nland is at the mercy of the owner of the water right. In general, the\r\nlands greatly exceed the capacities of the streams. Thus the lands\r\nhave no value without water. If the water rights fall into the hands\r\nof irrigating companies and the lands into the hands of individual\r\nfarmers, the farmers then will be dependent upon the stock companies,\r\nand eventually the monopoly of water rights will be an intolerable\r\nburden to the people.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the interests involved must not be overlooked. All the\r\npresent and future agriculture of more than four-tenths of the area\r\nof the United States is dependent upon irrigation, and practically\r\nall values for agricultural industries inhere, not in the lands but\r\nin the water. Monopoly of land need not be feared. The question for\r\nlegislators to solve is to devise some practical means by which water\r\nrights may be distributed among individual farmers and water monopolies\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nThe pioneers in the “new countries” in the United States have\r\ninvariably been characterized by enterprise and industry and an\r\nintense desire for the speedy development of their new homes. These\r\ncharacteristics are no whit less prominent in the Rocky Mountain Region\r\nthan in the earlier “new countries”; but they are even more apparent.\r\nThe hardy pioneers engage in a multiplicity of industrial enterprises\r\nsurprising to the people of long established habits and institutions.\r\nUnder the impetus of this spirit irrigation companies are organized and\r\ncapital invested in irrigating canals, and but little heed is given\r\nto philosophic considerations of political economy or to the ultimate\r\ncondition of affairs in which their present enterprises will result.\r\nThe pioneer is fully engaged in the present with its hopes of immediate\r\nremuneration for labor. The present development of the country fully\r\noccupies him. For this reason every effort put forth to increase the\r\narea of the agricultural land by irrigation is welcomed. Every man who\r\nturns his attention to this department of industry is considered a\r\npublic benefactor. But if in the eagerness for present development a\r\nland and water system shall grow up in which the practical control of\r\nagriculture shall fall into the hands of water companies, evils will\r\nresult therefrom that generations may not be able to correct, and the\r\nvery men who are now lauded as benefactors to the country will, in the\r\nungovernable reaction which is sure to come, be denounced as oppressors\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n_The right to use water should inhere in the land to be irrigated, and\r\nwater rights should go with land titles._\r\n\r\nThose unacquainted with the industrial institutions of the far west,\r\ninvolving the use of lands and waters, may without careful thought\r\nsuppose that the long recognized principles of the common law are\r\nsufficient to prevent the severance of land and water rights; but\r\nother practices are obtaining which have, or eventually will have,\r\nall the force of common law, because the necessities of the country\r\nrequire the change, and these practices are obtaining the color of\r\nright from state and territorial legislation, and to some extent by\r\nnational legislation. In all that country the natural channels of the\r\nstreams cannot be made to govern water rights without great injury\r\nto its agricultural and mining industries. For the great purposes of\r\nirrigation and hydraulic mining the water has no value in its natural\r\nchannel. In general the water cannot be used for irrigation on the\r\nlands immediately contiguous to the streams--_i. e._, the flood plains\r\nor bottom valleys--for reasons more fully explained in a subsequent\r\nchapter. The waters must be taken to a greater or less extent on the\r\nbench lands to be used in irrigation. All the waters of all the arid\r\nlands will eventually be taken from their natural channels, and they\r\ncan be utilized only to the extent to which they are thus removed, and\r\nwater rights must of necessity be severed from the natural channels.\r\nThere is another important factor to be considered. The water when used\r\nin irrigation is absorbed by the soil and reëvaporated to the heavens.\r\nIt cannot be taken from its natural channel, used, and returned. Again,\r\nthe water cannot in general be properly utilized in irrigation by\r\nrequiring it to be taken from its natural channel within the limits\r\nordinarily included in a single ownership. In order to conduct the\r\nwater on the higher bench lands where it is to be used in irrigation,\r\nit is necessary to go up the stream until a level is reached from which\r\nthe waters will flow to the lands to be redeemed. The exceptions to\r\nthis are so small that the statement scarcely needs qualification.\r\nThus, to use the water it must be diverted from its natural course\r\noften miles or scores of miles from where it is to be used.\r\n\r\nThe ancient principles of common law applying to the use of natural\r\nstreams, so wise and equitable in a humid region, would, if applied to\r\nthe Arid Region, practically prohibit the growth of its most important\r\nindustries. Thus it is that a custom is springing up in the Arid\r\nRegion which may or may not have color of authority in statutory or\r\ncommon law; on this I do not wish to express an opinion; but certain\r\nit is that water rights are practically being severed from the natural\r\nchannels of the streams; and this must be done. In the change, it is\r\nto be feared that water rights will in many cases be separated from\r\nall land rights as the system is now forming. If this fear is not\r\ngroundless, to the extent that such a separation is secured, water\r\nwill become a property independent of the land, and this property will\r\nbe gradually absorbed by a few. Monopolies of water will be secured,\r\nand the whole agriculture of the country will be tributary thereto--a\r\ncondition of affairs which an American citizen having in view the\r\ninterests of the largest number of people cannot contemplate with favor.\r\n\r\nPractically, in that country the right to water is acquired by priority\r\nof utilization, and this is as it should be from the necessities of\r\nthe country. But two important qualifications are needed. The _user\r\nright_ should attach to the _land_ where used, not to the individual or\r\ncompany constructing the canals by which it is used. The right to the\r\nwater should inhere in the land where it is used; the priority of usage\r\nshould secure the right. But this needs some slight modification. A\r\nfarmer settling on a small tract, to be redeemed by irrigation, should\r\nbe given a reasonable length of time in which to secure his water right\r\nby utilization, that he may secure it by his own labor, either directly\r\nby constructing the waterways himself, or indirectly by coöperating\r\nwith his neighbors in constructing systems of waterways. Without\r\nthis provision there is little inducement for poor men to commence\r\nfarming operations, and men of ready capital only will engage in such\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\nThe tentative bills submitted have been drawn on the theory thus\r\nbriefly enunciated.\r\n\r\nIf there be any doubt of the ultimate legality of the practices of the\r\npeople in the arid country relating to water and land rights, all such\r\ndoubts should be speedily quieted through the enactment of appropriate\r\nlaws by the national legislature. Perhaps an amplification by the\r\ncourts of what has been designated as the _natural right_ to the use of\r\nwater may be made to cover the practices now obtaining; but it hardly\r\nseems wise to imperil interests so great by intrusting them to the\r\npossibility of some future court made law.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE LANDS SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED.\r\n\r\nSuch a system of disposing of the public lands in the Arid Region will\r\nnecessitate an authoritative classification of the same. The largest\r\namount of land that it is possible to redeem by irrigation, excepting\r\nthose tracts watered by lone springs, brooks, and the small branches,\r\nshould be classed as irrigable lands, to give the greatest possible\r\ndevelopment to this industry. The limit of the timber lands should\r\nbe clearly defined, to prevent the fraudulent acquirement of these\r\nlands as pasturage lands. The irrigable and timber lands are of small\r\nextent, and their boundaries can easily be fixed. All of the lands\r\nfalling without these boundaries would be relegated to the greater\r\nclass designated as pasturage lands. It is true that all such lands\r\nwill not be of value for pasturage purposes, but in general it would be\r\ndifficult to draw a line between absolutely desert lands and pasturage\r\nlands, and no practical purposes would be subserved thereby. Fix the\r\nboundaries of the timber lands that they may be acquired by proper\r\nmethods; fix the boundaries of the irrigable lands that they may also\r\nbe acquired by proper methods, and then permit the remaining lands to\r\nbe acquired by settlers as pasturage lands, to the extent that they may\r\nbe made available, and there will be no fear of settlers encroaching on\r\nthe desert or valueless lands.\r\n\r\nHeretofore we have been considering only three great classes of\r\nlands--namely, irrigable, timber, and pasturage lands, although\r\npractically and under the laws there are two other classes of lands\r\nto be recognized--namely, mineral lands, _i. e._, lands bearing lodes\r\nor placers of gold, silver, cinnabar, etc., and coal lands. Under the\r\nlaw these lands are made special. Mineral lands are withheld from\r\ngeneral sale, and titles to the mines are acquired by the investment\r\nof labor and capital to an amount specified in the law. Coal lands\r\nare sold for $20 per acre. The mineral lands proper, though widely\r\nscattered, are of small extent. Where the mines are lodes, the lands\r\nlie along the mountains, and are to a greater or less extent valueless\r\nfor all other purposes. Where the mines are placers, they may also be\r\nagricultural lands, but their extent is very limited. To withhold these\r\nlands from purchase and settlement as irrigable, timber, and pasturage\r\nlands will in no material way affect the interests of the industries\r\nconnected with the last mentioned lands. The General Government\r\ncannot reasonably engage in the research necessary to determine the\r\nmineral lands, but this is practically done by the miners themselves.\r\nThousands of hardy, skilful men are vigorously engaged in this work,\r\nand as mines are discovered mining districts are organized, and on the\r\nproper representation of these interested parties the mineral lands\r\nare withheld from general sale by the Land Department. Thus, proper\r\nprovision is already made for this branch of the work of classification.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the Arid Region there are extensive deposits of\r\ncoal. These coal fields are inexhaustible by any population which the\r\ncountry can support for any length of time that human prevision can\r\ncontemplate. To withhold from general settlement the entire area of the\r\nworkable coal fields would be absurd. Only a small fraction will be\r\nneeded for the next century. Only those lands should be classed as coal\r\nlands that contain beds of coal easily accessible, and where there is\r\na possibility of their being used as such within the next generation\r\nor two. To designate or set apart these lands will require the highest\r\ngeological skill; a thorough geological survey is necessary.\r\n\r\nIn providing for a general classification of the lands of the Arid\r\nRegion, it will, then, be necessary to recognize the following classes,\r\nnamely: mineral lands, coal lands, irrigable lands, timber lands,\r\nand pasturage lands. The mineral lands are practically classified by\r\nthe miners themselves, and for this no further legal provision is\r\nnecessary. The coal lands must be determined by geological survey.\r\nThe work of determining the areas which should be relegated to the\r\nother classes--namely, irrigable, timber, and pasturage lands--will be\r\ncomparatively inexpensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n       THE RAINFALL OF THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Smithsonian Institution conducted for a number of years an\r\nextensive system of measurements of rainfall in the United States,\r\nand at the same time diligently collected pluvial records from every\r\npossible source. The accumulated data thus collected were placed in the\r\nhands of Mr. Charles A. Schott for reduction and discussion, and he\r\nprepared the “Smithsonian Tables of Precipitation in Rain and Snow”,\r\nwhich appeared in 1868. Since that time much additional material has\r\nbeen acquired by the continuation of the work to the present time,\r\nand also by a great increase in the number of observation stations,\r\nand so valuable is this new material that it has been determined to\r\nrecompile the tables and issue a second edition. By the time the\r\npresent report was called for, the preliminary computations for the\r\ntables had developed an important body of facts bearing on the climate\r\nof the Arid Region, and through the courtesy of Prof. Joseph Henry,\r\nSecretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and of Mr. Schott, they were\r\nplaced at my disposal. Mr. Schott also made such a change in the order\r\nof computation as to give precedence to the states and territories\r\nwhich form the subject of this investigation, and by this timely favor\r\nmade it possible to base the following discussion on the very latest\r\ndeterminations of rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe results thus made available exhibit the mean precipitation at\r\neach station of observation west of the Mississippi River for each\r\nmonth, for each season, and for the year. A number of other data\r\nare also tabulated, including the latitude, longitude, and altitude\r\nof each station, and the extent of each series of observations in\r\nyears and months. In selecting material for the present purpose the\r\nshorter records were ignored. The variations from year to year are\r\nso great that an isolated record of a single year is of no value\r\nas an indication of the average rainfall. The mean of two or three\r\nyears is almost equally liable to mislead, and only a long series of\r\nobservations can afford accurate results. In the following tables no\r\nstations are included (with one exception) which show records of less\r\nthan five years’ extent.\r\n\r\nTable I shows the precipitation of the Sub-humid Region; Table II, of\r\nthe Arid Region; Table III, of the San Francisco Region; and Table IV,\r\nof the Region of the Lower Columbia. The limits of each region have\r\nbeen given in a former chapter, and need not be repeated. In each table\r\nthe first column contains the names of the stations of observation;\r\nthe second, their latitudes; the third, their longitudes (west from\r\nGreenwich); and the fourth, their altitudes in feet above the level\r\nof the sea. The next four columns show for each season of the year\r\nthe mean observed rainfall in inches, and their sum appears in the\r\nfollowing column as the mean yearly rainfall. In the last column the\r\nextent of each series of observations is given in years and months. In\r\nTable I the stations are arranged by latitudes, in Tables II, III, and\r\nIV, alphabetically.\r\n\r\n\r\n            TABLE I.--_Precipitation of Sub-humid Region._\r\n\r\n +----------------------+----------+-----------+--------+\r\n |       Station.       | Latitude.| Longitude.| Height.|\r\n +----------------------+----------+-----------+--------+\r\n |                      |  °  ´    | °   ´     |  Feet. |\r\n |Pembina, Dak          | 48  57   | 97  03    |   768  |\r\n |Fort Totten, Dak      | 47  56   | 99  16    | 1,480  |\r\n |Fort Abercrombie, Dak | 46  27   | 96  21    |   --   |\r\n |Fort Wadsworth, Dak   | 45  43   | 97  10    | 1,650  |\r\n |Omaha Agency, Nebr    | 42  07   | 96  22    |   --   |\r\n |Fort Kearney, Nebr    | 40  38   | 98  57    | 2,360  |\r\n |Fort Riley, Kans      | 39  03   | 96  35    | 1,300  |\r\n |Fort Hays, Kans       | 38  59   | 99  20    | 2,107  |\r\n |Fort Larned, Kans     | 38  10   | 98  57    | 1,932  |\r\n |Fort Belknap, Tex     | 33  08   | 98  46    | 1,600  |\r\n |Fort Griffin, Tex     | 32  54   | 99  14    |   --   |\r\n |Fort Chadbourne, Tex  | 31  58   |100  15    | 2,020  |\r\n |Fort McKavett, Tex    | 30  48   |100  08    | 2,060  |\r\n |New Braunfels, Tex    | 29  42   | 98  15    |   720  |\r\n |Fort Clark, Tex       | 29  17   |100  25    | 1,000  |\r\n |Fort Inge, Tex        | 29  10   | 99  50    |   845  |\r\n |Fort Duncan, Tex      | 28  39   |100  30    | 1,460  |\r\n |Fort Brown, Tex       | 25  50   | 97  37    |    50  |\r\n +----------------------+----------+-----------+--------+\r\n\r\n +----------------------+--------------------------------------+-------+\r\n |                      |     Mean precipitation, in inches.   |Extent |\r\n |                      +-------+-------+-------+-------+------+  of   |\r\n |       Station.       |Spring.|Summer.|Autumn.|Winter.| Year.|record.|\r\n +----------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------+-------+\r\n |                      |       |       |       |       |      | Y.

But in certain districts the rainfall is\r\nconcentrated in certain months so as to produce a “rainy season”, and\r\nwherever the temperature of the rainy season is adapted to the raising\r\nof crops it is found that “dry farming” can be carried on with less\r\nthan 20 inches of annual rain. There are two such districts upon the\r\nborders of the Arid Region, and within its limits there may be a third.\r\n\r\n_First District._--Along the eastern border of the Arid Region a\r\ncontrast has been observed between the results obtained at the north\r\nand at the south. In Texas 20 inches of rain are not sufficient for\r\nagriculture, while in Dakota and Minnesota a less amount is sufficient.\r\nThe explanation is clearly developed by a comparison of the tables\r\nof rainfall with reference to the distribution of rain in different\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  TABLE V.--_Precipitation of Texas._\r\n\r\n +---------------------------------------------------+\r\n |                            |Latitude.             |\r\n |                            |      |Longitude.     |\r\n |                            |      |       |Height.|\r\n |     Station.               |      |       |       |\r\n |                            |      |       |       |\r\n +----------------------------+------+-------+-------+\r\n |                            | ° ´  |  ° ´  | Feet. |\r\n |Austin                      |30 17 | 97 44 |   650 |\r\n |Camp Verde                  |30 00 | 99 10 | 1,400 |\r\n |Fort Belknap                |33 08 | 98 46 | 1,600 |\r\n |Fort Bliss (El Paso)        |31 47 |106 30 | 3,830 |\r\n |Fort Brown                  |25 50 | 97 37 |    50 |\r\n |Fort Chadbourne             |31 58 |100 15 | 2,020 |\r\n |Fort Clark                  |29 17 |100 25 | 1,000 |\r\n |Fort Davis                  |30 40 |104 07 | 4,700 |\r\n |Fort Duncan                 |28 39 |100 30 | 1,460 |\r\n |Fort Griffin                |32 54 | 99 14 |  --   |\r\n |Fort Inge                   |29 10 | 99 50 |   845 |\r\n |Fort Mason                  |30 40 | 99 15 | 1,200 |\r\n |Fort McIntosh               |27 35 | 99 48 |   806 |\r\n |Fort McKavett               |30 48 |100 08 | 2,060 |\r\n |Fort Stockton               |30 20 |102 30 | 4,950 |\r\n |Galveston                   |29 18 | 94 47 |    30 |\r\n |Gilmer (near)               |32 40 | 94 59 |   950 |\r\n |New Braunfels               |29 42 | 98 15 |   720 |\r\n |Ringgold Barracks           |26 33 | 99 00 |   521 |\r\n |San Antonio                 |29 25 | 98 25 |   600 |\r\n +---------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n +----------------------------+-------------------------------+-------+\r\n |                            |      Mean precipitation,      |       |\r\n |                            |           in inches.          |       |\r\n |                            +-------------------------------+       |\r\n |                            |Spring.                        |       |\r\n |                            |     |Summer.                  |Extent |\r\n |                            |     |     |Autumn.            |  of   |\r\n |     Station.               |     |     |     |Winter.      |record.|\r\n |                            |     |     |     |      |Year. |       |\r\n +----------------------------+-----+-----+-----+------+------+-------+\r\n |                            |     |     |     |      |      | Y.

If the means of rainfall for\r\nthe state be compared with the means for single stations, it will be\r\nseen that there is a general correspondence in the ratios pertaining\r\nto the different seasons, so that the former can fairly be considered\r\nto represent for the state the distribution through the year. Table VI\r\npresents the data for Dakota in the same way, and the correspondence\r\nbetween the general mean and the station mean is here exceedingly\r\nclose. At each of the nine stations, the greatest rainfall is recorded\r\nin summer, the next greatest in spring, and the least in winter.\r\nPlacing the two series of results in the form of percentages, they show\r\na decided contrast:\r\n\r\n  +-------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-------+\r\n  |             | Spring. | Summer. | Autumn. | Winter. | Year. |\r\n  +-------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-------+\r\n  | Dakota      |    30   |   43    |   17    |   10    |  100  |\r\n  | Texas       |    21   |   31    |   31    |   17    |  100  |\r\n  +-------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-------+\r\n\r\nIn Dakota a rainy season is well marked, and 73 per cent. of the rain\r\nfalls in spring and summer, or at the time when it is most needed\r\nby the farmer. In Texas only 52 per cent. of the rain falls in the\r\nseason of agriculture. The availability of rain in the two regions is\r\ntherefore in the ratio of 73 to 52, and for agricultural purposes 20\r\ninches of rainfall in Texas is equivalent to about 15 inches in Dakota.\r\n\r\nFor the further exhibition of the subject, Table VII has been\r\nprepared, comprising stations in the Region of the Plains all the\r\nway from our northern to our southern boundary. By way of restricting\r\nattention to the practical problem of the limit of “dry farming”, only\r\nthose stations are admitted which exhibit a mean annual rainfall of\r\nmore than 15 and less than 25 inches.

The spring\r\nquota of rainfall progressively diminishes from north to south, and\r\nso does the summer, while the fall and winter quotas increase. What\r\nis lost in summer is gained in winter, and thereby the inequality of\r\nrainfall from season to season is diminished, so that a rainy season is\r\nnot so well defined in Texas as in Dakota. What is lost in spring is\r\ngained in autumn, and thereby the place of the rainy season in the year\r\nis shifted. In Dakota the maximum of rain is earlier than in Texas, and\r\ncorresponds more nearly with the maximum of temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE VIII.--_Seasonal precipitation in the San Francisco Region._\r\n\r\n +-----------------+-------+-------+---------------------------------+\r\n |                 |       |       |  Percentage of annual rainfall. |\r\n |                 |       |       +---------------------------------+\r\n |                 |Extent | Mean  |Spring.                  |       |\r\n |    Station.     | of    |annual |     |Summer.            |Winter |\r\n |                 |record.| rain- |     |     |Autumn.      |  and  |\r\n |                 |       | fall. |     |     |     |Winter.|spring.|\r\n +-----------------+-------+-------+-----+-----+-----+-------+-------+\r\n |                 | Y.

It will\r\nbe seen by Tables III and VIII that no rain falls in summer, while the\r\nwinter months receive 60 per cent. of the annual precipitation, and\r\nthe spring 25 per cent. The general yearly rainfall of the district is\r\nonly about 16 inches, but by this remarkable concentration a period of\r\nfive months is made to receive 13 inches. The winter temperature of the\r\ndistrict is no less remarkable, and supplies the remaining condition\r\nessential to agriculture. Frosts are rare, and in the valleys all the\r\nprecipitation has the form of rain. The nine stations which afford the\r\nrainfall records given above show a mean spring temperature of 57° (see\r\nTable IX). Thirteen inches of rain coming in a frostless winter and\r\nspring have been found sufficient for remunerative agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n   TABLE IX.--_Mean temperatures, by seasons, for the San Francisco\r\n                               Region._\r\n\r\n +-----------------+-------+------------------------------------------+\r\n |                 |Extent |    Mean temperatures, in degrees Fahr.   |\r\n |    Station.     |  of   +------------------------------------------+\r\n |                 |record.| Spring.| Summer.| Autumn.| Winter.| Year.|\r\n +-----------------+-------+---------+--------+-------+--------+------+\r\n |                 | Y.

The Region of the Lower Columbia, with an average\r\nrainfall of 46 inches, receives 47 per cent. of it in winter and 24\r\nper cent. in spring. Southward on the coast, Drum Barracks (near Los\r\nAngeles) and San Diego receive more than half their rain in winter,\r\nbut as the whole amount is only 9 inches agriculture is not benefited.\r\nThe eastern bases of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range exhibit the\r\nwinter maximum of rainfall, and this feature can be traced eastward\r\nin Idaho and Nevada, but in these districts it is accompanied by no\r\namelioration of winter temperature.

The\r\nprincipal minimum is in spring. In Table XI the stations are arranged\r\naccording to longitudes, a disposition well suited to exhibit their\r\nrelations. In eastern New Mexico the distribution of rainfall has the\r\nsame character as in adjacent Texas, but with a more decided maximum.\r\nHalf of the total rainfall is in summer and half of the remainder in\r\nautumn. Westward the maximum diminishes slightly, but it appears in\r\nevery station of the two territories. In western Arizona the winter\r\nmaximum of the Pacific coast asserts itself, and it can be traced\r\neastward as far as Fort Wingate, New Mexico.

The yearly precipitation is very small, and the summer quota\r\nrarely exceeds seven or eight inches. Nevertheless the Pueblo Indians\r\nhave succeeded, in a few localities, and by a unique method, in raising\r\nmaize without irrigation. The yield is too meagre to tempt the white\r\nman to follow their example, and for his use the region is agricultural\r\nonly where it can be watered artificially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                             WATER SUPPLY.\r\n\r\n                           BY G. K. GILBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following discussion is based upon a special study of the\r\ndrainage-basin of Great Salt Lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         INCREASE OF STREAMS.\r\n\r\nThe residents of Utah who practice irrigation have observed that many\r\nof the streams have increased in volume since the settlement of the\r\ncountry. Of the actuality of this increase there can be no question.\r\nA popular impression in regard to the fluctuations of an unmeasured\r\nelement of climate may be very erroneous, as, for example, the\r\nimpression that the rainfall of the timbered states has been diminished\r\nby the clearing of the land, but in the case of these streams relative\r\nmeasurements have practically been made. Some of them were so fully\r\nin use twenty years ago that all of their water was diverted from\r\nits channels at the “critical period”, and yet the dependent fields\r\nsuffered from drought in the drier years. Afterward, it was found that\r\nin all years there was enough water and to spare, and operations were\r\nextended. Additional canals were dug and new lands were added to the\r\nfields; and this was repeated from time to time, until in many places\r\nthe service of a stream was doubled, and in a few it was increased\r\ntenfold, or even fiftyfold. It is a matter of great importance to the\r\nagricultural interests, not only of Utah but of the whole district\r\ndependent on irrigation, that the cause or causes of this change shall\r\nbe understood. Until they are known we cannot tell whether the present\r\ngain is an omen of future gain or of future loss, nor whether the\r\nfuture changes are within or beyond our control. I shall therefore take\r\nthe liberty to examine somewhat at length the considerations which are\r\nsupposed by myself or others to bear upon the problem.\r\n\r\nFortunately we are not compelled to depend on the incidental\r\nobservations of the farming community for the amount of the increase\r\nof the streams, but merely for the fact of their increase. The amount\r\nis recorded in an independent and most thorough manner, by the\r\naccumulation of the water in Great Salt Lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       RISE OF GREAT SALT LAKE.\r\n\r\nA lake with an outlet has its level determined by the height of the\r\noutlet. Great Salt Lake, having no outlet, has its level determined by\r\nthe relation of evaporation to inflow. On one hand the drainage of a\r\ngreat basin pours into it a continuous though variable tribute; on the\r\nother, there is a continuous absorption of its water by the atmosphere\r\nabove it. The inflow is greatest in the spring time, while the snows\r\nare melting in the mountains, and least in the autumn after the melting\r\nhas ceased, but before the cooling of the air has greatly checked\r\nevaporation on the uplands. The lake evaporation is greatest in summer,\r\nwhile the air is warm, and least in winter. Through the winter and\r\nspring the inflow exceeds the evaporation, and the lake rises. In the\r\nlatter part of the summer and in autumn the loss is greater than the\r\ngain, and the lake falls. The maximum occurs in June or July, and the\r\nminimum probably in November. The difference between the two, or the\r\nheight of the annual tide, is about 20 inches.\r\n\r\nBut it rarely happens that the annual evaporation is precisely equal\r\nto the annual inflow, and each year the lake gains or loses an amount\r\nwhich depends upon the climate of the year. If the air which crosses\r\nthe drainage basin of the lake in any year is unusually moist, there\r\nis a twofold tendency to raise the mean level. On one hand there\r\nis a greater precipitation, whereby the inflow is increased, and\r\non the other hand there is a less evaporation. So, too, if the air\r\nis unusually dry, the inflow is correspondingly small, the loss by\r\nevaporation is correspondingly great, and the contents of the lake\r\ndiminish. This annual gain or loss is an expression, and a very\r\ndelicate expression, of the mean annual humidity of a large district of\r\ncountry, and as such is more trustworthy than any result which might\r\nbe derived from local observations with psychrometer and rain gauge.\r\nA succession of relatively dry years causes a progressive fall of the\r\nlake, and a succession of moist years a progressive rise. As the water\r\nfalls it retires from its shore, and the slopes being exceedingly\r\ngentle the area of the lake is rapidly contracted. The surface for\r\nevaporation diminishes and its ratio to the inflow becomes less. As the\r\nwater rises the surface of the lake rapidly increases, and the ratio of\r\nevaporation to inflow becomes greater. In this way a limit is set to\r\nthe oscillation of the lake as dependent on the ordinary fluctuations\r\nof climate, and the cumulation of results is prevented. Whenever the\r\nvariation of the water level from its mean position becomes great,\r\nthe resistance to its further advance in that direction becomes\r\nproportionally great. For the convenience of a name, I shall speak of\r\nthis oscillation of the lake as the _limited oscillation_. It depends\r\non an oscillation of climate which is universally experienced, but\r\nwhich has not been found to exhibit either periodicity, or synchrony\r\nover large areas, or other features of regularity.\r\n\r\nBeside the annual tide and the limited oscillation, the lake has been\r\nfound to exhibit a third change, and this third or _abnormal_ change\r\nseems to be connected with the increase of the tributary streams. In\r\norder to exhibit it, it will be necessary to discuss somewhat fully the\r\nhistory of the rise and fall of the lake, and I shall take occasion at\r\nthe same time to call attention to the preparations that have recently\r\nbeen made for future observations.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the year 1875 no definite record was made. In 1874 Prof.\r\nJoseph Henry, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, began a\r\ncorrespondence with Dr. John R. Park, of Salt Lake City, in regard to\r\nthe fluctuations and other peculiarities of the lake, and as a chief\r\nresult a systematic record was begun. With the coöperation of Mr. J.\r\nL. Barfoot and other citizens of Utah, Dr. Park erected a graduated\r\npillar at Black Rock, a point on the southern shore which was then a\r\npopular summer resort. It consisted of a granite block cut in the form\r\nof an obelisk and engraved on one side with a scale of feet and inches.\r\nIt was set in gravel beneath shallow water, with the zero of its scale\r\nnear the surface. The water level was read on the pillar by Mr. John\r\nT. Mitchell at frequent intervals from September 14, 1875, to October\r\n9, 1876, when the locality ceased to be used as a watering place, and\r\nthe systematic record was discontinued. Two observations were made by\r\nthe writer in 1877, and it was found in making the second that the\r\nshifting gravel of the beach had buried the column so deeply as to\r\nconceal half the graduation.\r\n\r\nDr. Park has kindly furnished me a copy of Mr. Mitchell’s record.\r\nThe observer was instructed to choose such times of observation that\r\nthe influence of wind storms upon the level of the lake would be\r\neliminated, and the work appears to have been faithfully performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Record of the height of Great Salt Lake above the zero of the granite\r\n                        pillar at Black Rock._\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+-------------+-------------------+\r\n  |        Date.         |   Reading.  |       Wind.       |\r\n  +------+----------+----+-----+-------+----------+--------+\r\n  |      |          |    |     |       |          |        |\r\n  | Year.|  Month.  |Day.|Feet.|Inches.|Direction.| Force. |\r\n  +------+----------+----+-----+-------+----------+--------+\r\n  |1875  |September | 14 |  0  |   6   |    N.    |Gentle. |\r\n  |      |          | 22 |  0  | 5¹⁄₂  |  N.

To provide for such a contingency\r\nit was determined to establish a bench mark out of reach of the waves,\r\nand connect it with the pillar by leveling, so that if the existing\r\nstandard should be destroyed its record would still have a definite\r\nmeaning, and the relative height of a new standard could be ascertained\r\nwith precision. In this undertaking I was joined by Mr. Jesse W. Fox,\r\na gentleman who has long held the office of territorial surveyor of\r\nUtah. A suitable stone was furnished by the Hon. Brigham Young, and was\r\ncarried to Black Rock without charge through the courtesy of Mr. Heber\r\nP. Kimball, superintendent of the Utah Western Railroad. The block is\r\nof granite, and is three feet in length. It was sunk in the earth, all\r\nbut a few inches, on the northern slope of a small limestone knoll just\r\nsouth of the railroad track at Black Rock. Its top is dressed square,\r\nabout 10 × 10 inches, and is marked with a +. It will be convenient to\r\nspeak of the top of this monument as the _Black Rock bench_. On the\r\n11th of July, 1877, the surface of the lake was 34.5 feet below the\r\nbench, and it then marked 2.0 feet on the pillar erected by Dr. Park.\r\nThe zero of the observation pillar is therefore 36.5 feet below the\r\nbench.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying topographic sketch will serve at any time to identify\r\nthe position of the bench.\r\n\r\nAfter consultation with Dr. Park, I concluded that it would be\r\nbetter not to depend on the Black Rock station for observations in\r\nthe future--at least in the immediate future--and other points were\r\ndiscussed. Eventually it was determined to establish a new station near\r\nFarmington, on the eastern shore of the lake. The point selected is in\r\nan inlet so sheltered that a heavy swell in the lake will not interfere\r\nwith accurate observation. At the present stage of water the spot is\r\nwell adapted to the purpose, and it can be used with the water 2 feet\r\nlower or 5 feet higher. I was not able to attend personally to the\r\nerection of the pillar, but left the matter in the hands of Mr. Jacob\r\nMiller, of Farmington, who writes me that it was placed in position and\r\nthe record begun on the 24th of November, 1877. The pillar is of wood,\r\nand is graduated to inches for 9 feet of its length.\r\n\r\nOn the day of its establishment the reading of the water surface was 2\r\nfeet 1 inch. On the 21st of January, 1878, the reading was 2 feet 1¹⁄₂\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nThe Farmington and Black Rock pillars are 23 miles apart. The relative\r\nheight of their zeros will be ascertained as soon as practicable by\r\nmaking coincident readings, during still weather, of the water surface\r\nat the two stations. It is already known that the Farmington zero is\r\n_approximately_ 16 inches lower than the Black Rock.\r\n\r\nA stone “bench” or monument for permanent reference has also been\r\nplaced on rising ground near the observation pillar, and the two will\r\nbe connected by spirit level. The Farmington bench is of gneiss, and\r\nis marked with a + in the same manner as the Black Rock. The stone was\r\ncontributed by Mr. Abbott, of Farmington, and was gratuitously shaped\r\nand placed by Mr. Miller.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller has also voluntarily assumed charge of the record, and will\r\nmake or superintend the observations. It will not be practicable to\r\nvisit the pillar daily, nor even at _regular_ intervals, but it is\r\nexpected that the record will be as full as the one tabulated above.\r\nThe following items are to be noted:\r\n\r\n1. Time of observation, including year, month, day, and hour.\r\n\r\n2. Reading of water surface in feet and inches.\r\n\r\n3. Direction and force of wind.\r\n\r\n4. Account of wind for the preceding 24 hours.\r\n\r\n5. Name of observer.\r\n\r\nThese observations will not only determine the annual gain or loss of\r\nthe lake, but will in a few years give data to construct the curve of\r\nthe annual tide.\r\n\r\nThe history of past changes not having been the subject of record,\r\nit became necessary to compile it from such collateral data as were\r\nattainable. The enquiries inaugurated by Professor Henry have been\r\nprosecuted, and have resulted in a tolerably definite determination of\r\nthe principal changes since 1847, together with the indication of a\r\nsuperior limit to earlier oscillations.\r\n\r\nEver since the settlement of Salt Lake City, in 1847, the islands of\r\nthe lake have been used as herd grounds. Fremont and Carrington islands\r\nhave been reached by boat, and Antelope and Stansbury islands partly\r\nby boat, partly by fording, and partly by land communication. A large\r\nshare of the navigation has been performed by citizens of Farmington,\r\nand the shore is in that neighborhood so flat that the changes of\r\nwater level have necessitated frequent changes of landing place. The\r\npursuits of the boatmen have been so greatly affected that all of the\r\nmore important fluctuations were impressed upon their memories, and\r\nmost of the changes were so associated with features of the topography\r\nthat some estimate of their quantitative values could be made. The\r\ndata which became thus available were collated for Professor Henry by\r\nMr. Miller, a gentleman who himself took part in the navigation, and\r\nof whom I have already had occasion to speak. His results agree very\r\nclosely with those derived from an independent investigation of my own,\r\nto which I will now proceed.\r\n\r\nAntelope Island is connected with the delta of the Jordan River by a\r\nbroad, flat sand bar that has been usually submerged but occasionally\r\nexposed. It slopes very gently toward the island, and just where it\r\njoins it is interrupted by a narrow channel a few inches in depth.\r\nFor a number of years this bar afforded the means of access to the\r\nisland, and many persons traversed it. By combining the evidence of\r\nsuch persons it has been practicable to learn the condition of the ford\r\nup to the time of its final abandonment. From 1847 to 1850 the bar was\r\ndry during the low stage of each winter, and in summer covered by not\r\nmore than 20 inches of water. Then began a rise which continued until\r\n1855 or 1856. At that time a horseman could with difficulty ford in the\r\nwinter, but all communication was by boat in summer. Then the water\r\nfell for a series of years until in 1860 and 1861 the bar was again dry\r\nin winter. The spring of 1862 was marked by an unusual fall of rain and\r\nsnow, whereby the streams were greatly flooded and the lake surface was\r\nraised several feet. In subsequent years the rise continued, until in\r\n1865 the ford became impassable. According to Mr. Miller the present\r\nheight was attained in about 1868, and there have since occurred only\r\nminor fluctuations.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of connecting the traditional history as derived from\r\nthe ford with the systematic record that has now been inaugurated, I\r\nvisited the bar in company with Mr. Miller on the 19th of October,\r\n1877, and made careful soundings. The features of the ford had\r\nbeen minutely described, and there was no uncertainty as to the\r\nidentification of the locality. We found 9 feet of water on the sand\r\nflat, and 9 feet 6 inches in the little channel at its edge. The\r\nexamination was completed at 11 a. m.; at 5 p. m. the water stood at 0\r\nfeet 10 inches on the Black Rock pillar; and on the following day at 8\r\na. m. we marked its level at the place where the Farmington pillar now\r\nstands, our mark being 2 feet 2 inches above the zero of the pillar.\r\n\r\nThe Antelope Island bar thus affords a tolerably complete record from\r\n1847 to 1865, but fails to give any later details. It happens, however,\r\nthat the hiatus is filled at another locality. Stansbury Island is\r\njoined to the mainland by a similar bar, which was entirely above\r\nwater at the time of Captain Stansbury’s survey, and so continued for\r\nmany years. In 1866, the year following that in which the Antelope bar\r\nbecame unfordable, the water for the first time covered the Stansbury\r\nbar, and its subsequent advance and recession have so affected the\r\npursuits of the citizens of Grantsville, who used the island for a\r\nwinter herd ground, that it will not be difficult to obtain a full\r\nrecord by compiling their forced observations. Since undertaking the\r\ninquiry I have had no opportunity to visit that town, but the following\r\nfacts have been elicited by correspondence. Since the first flooding of\r\nthe bar the depth of water has never been less than 1 foot, and it has\r\nnever been so great as to prevent fording in winter. But in the summers\r\nof 1872, 1873, and 1874, during the flood stage of the annual tide,\r\nthere was no access except by boat, and in those years the lake level\r\nattained its greatest height. In the spring of 1869 the depth was 4¹⁄₂\r\nfeet, and in the autumn of 1877, 2¹⁄₂ feet.\r\n\r\nThe last item shows that the Stansbury bar is 7 feet higher than the\r\nAntelope, and serves to connect the two series of observations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Diagram showing the rise and fall of Great Salt Lake\r\nfrom 1847 to 1877._\r\n\r\n  N.

In the accompanying diagram\r\nthe horizontal spaces represent years, and the vertical, feet. The\r\nirregular curve shows the height of the lake in different years. Where\r\nit is drawn as a full line the data are definite; the dotted portions\r\nare interpolated.\r\n\r\nUpon the same diagram are indicated the levels of two storm lines. The\r\nupper is the limit of wave action at the present time, and is 3 feet\r\nabove the winter stage (October, 1877). It is everywhere marked by\r\ndrift wood, and in many places by a ridge of sand. Above it there is\r\na growth, on all steep shores, of sage and other bushes, but those in\r\nimmediate proximity are dead, having evidently been killed by the salt\r\nspray. Below the line are still standing the stumps of similar bushes,\r\nand the same can be found 2 or 3 feet below the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nThe lower storm line was observed by Captain Stansbury in 1850, and\r\nhas been described to me by a number of citizens of Utah to whom it\r\nwas familiar at that time and subsequently. Like the line now visible,\r\nit was marked by drift wood, and a growth of bushes, including the\r\nsage, extended down to it; but below it there were seen no stumps. Its\r\nposition is now several feet under water, and it is probable that the\r\nadvancing waves destroyed most of its features, but the vestiges of the\r\nbushy growth above it remain.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of the two storm lines have an important bearing on\r\nthe history of the lake. The fact that the belt of land between them\r\nsupported sage bushes shows that previous to its present submergence\r\nthe lake had not covered it for many years. Lands washed by the brine\r\nof the lake become saturated with salt to such extent that even\r\nsalt-loving plants cannot live upon them, and it is a familiar fact\r\nthat the sage (_Artemisia sempervirens_) never grows in Utah upon soil\r\nso saline as to be unfavorable for grain. The rains of many years, and\r\nperhaps even of centuries, would be needed to cleanse land abandoned by\r\nthe lake so that it could sustain the salt-hating bushes, and we cannot\r\navoid the conclusion that the ancient storm line had been for a long\r\nperiod the superior limit of the fluctuations of the lake surface.\r\n\r\nTo avoid misapprehension, it should be stated that the storm lines\r\nhave been described as they appear on the eastern shore of Antelope\r\nIsland, a locality where the slope of the ground amounts to three or\r\nfour degrees. The circumstances are different at the margin of the\r\nmainland, and especially where the slopes are very gentle. The lake is\r\nso shallow that its equilibrium is greatly disturbed by strong winds.\r\nIts waves are small, but in storms the water is pushed high up on the\r\nland toward which the wind blows, the extreme effects being produced\r\nwhere the inclination is most gentle. The islands, however, are little\r\nflooded; the water does not accumulate against them, but is driven\r\npast; and the easterly gales that produced the present storm line on\r\nthe east shore of Antelope Island may have driven so much water to\r\nthe westward as even to have depressed the level in that locality.\r\nMoreover, where the land surface is nearly level, the cleansing by rain\r\nof portions once submerged is indefinitely retarded. On all the flatter\r\nshores the lake is bordered by tracts too saline for reclamation by\r\nthe farmer, and either bare of vegetation or scantily covered by\r\nsalt-loving shrubs. These tracts are above the modern storm line, and\r\nthey acquired their salt during some flood too remote to be considered\r\nin this connection. The largest of them is called the Great Salt Lake\r\nDesert, and has a greater area than the lake itself.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that in recent times the lake has overstepped a bound\r\nto which it had long been subject. Previous to the year 1865, and for\r\na period of indefinite duration, it rose and fell with the limited\r\noscillation and with the annual tide, but was never carried above a\r\ncertain limiting line. In that year, or the one following, it passed\r\nthe line, and it has not yet returned. The annual tide and the limited\r\noscillation are continued as before, but the lowest stage of the new\r\nregime is higher than the highest stage of the old. The mean stage of\r\nthe new regime is 7 or 8 feet higher than the mean stage of the old.\r\nThe mean area of the water surface is a sixth part greater under the\r\nnew regime than under the old.\r\n\r\nThe last statement is based on the United States surveys of Captain\r\nStansbury and Mr. King. The former gathered the material for his map\r\nin 1850, when the water was at its lowest stage, and the latter in the\r\nspring of 1869, when the water was near its highest stage. The one map\r\nshows an area of 1,750 and the other of 2,166 square miles. From these\r\nI estimate the old mean area at 1,820 miles, the new at 2,125 miles,\r\nand the increase at 305 miles, or 17 per cent.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: COMPARATIVE MAP\r\n\r\n                                  OF\r\n\r\n                         GREAT SALT LAKE, UTAH\r\n\r\n                 COMPILED TO SHOW ITS INCREASE OF AREA\r\n\r\n _The topography and later shore-line are taken from the Survey of Mr.\r\n Clarence King, U.S. Geologist; the earlier shore-line from the Survey\r\n                  of Capt. Howard Stansbury, U.S.A._]\r\n\r\nThe “abnormal change” of the lake may then be described as an infilling\r\nor rise of the water whereby its ordinary level has been raised 7 or 8\r\nfeet and its ordinary area has been increased a sixth part; and this\r\nappears to be distinct from the limited oscillation and annual tide,\r\nwhich may be regarded as comparatively normal. To account for it a\r\nnumber of theories have been proposed, and three of them seem worthy\r\nof consideration. They appeal respectively to volcanic, climatic, and\r\nhuman agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           VOLCANIC THEORY.\r\n\r\nIt has been surmised that upheavals of the land, such as sometimes\r\naccompany earthquakes, might have changed the form of the lake bed\r\nand displaced from some region the water that has overflowed others.\r\nThis hypothesis acquires a certain plausibility from the fact that\r\nthe series of uplifts and downthrows by which the mountains of the\r\nregion were formed have been traced down to a very recent date, but\r\nit is negatived by such an array of facts that it cannot be regarded\r\nas tenable. In the first place, the water has risen against _all_ the\r\nshores and about every island of which we have account. The farmers\r\nof the eastern and southern margins have lost pastures and meadows by\r\nsubmergence. At the north, Bear River Bay has advanced several miles\r\nupon the land. At the west, a boat has recently sailed a number of\r\nmiles across tracts that were traversed by Captain Stansbury’s land\r\nparties. That officer has described and mapped Strong’s Knob and\r\nStansbury Island as peninsulas, but they have since become islands.\r\nAntelope Island is no longer accessible by ford, and Egg Island, the\r\nnesting ground of the gulls and pelicans, has become a reef. Springs\r\nthat supplied Captain Stansbury with fresh water near Promontory Point\r\nare now submerged and inaccessible; and other springs have been covered\r\non the shores of Antelope, Stansbury, and Fremont islands.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the rise of the lake is correlated in time with\r\nthe increase of the inflowing streams, which has been everywhere\r\nobserved by irrigators, and it is logical to refer the two phenomena to\r\nthe same cause.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, if upheaval could account for the enlargement of the\r\nlake, it would still be inadequate to account for the maintenance\r\nof its increased size, in the face of an evaporation that yearly\r\nremoves a layer several feet in depth. The same compensatory principle\r\nthat restricts the “limited oscillation” would quickly restore the\r\nequilibrium between inflow and evaporation, in whatever manner it was\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CLIMATIC THEORY.\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that the change is a phenomenon of climate,\r\nand this hypothesis includes harmoniously the increase of streams with\r\nthe increase of lake surface. By some it is thought that the climate of\r\nthe district is undergoing, or has undergone, a permanent change; and\r\nby others that the series of oscillations about a mean condition which\r\ncharacterizes every climate has in this case developed a moist phase\r\nof exceptional degree and duration. The latter view was my own before\r\nI became aware of the features of the ancient storm line, but it now\r\nappears to me untenable. That a variable surface of evaporation, which\r\nhad for a long period recognized a limit to its expansion, should not\r\nmerely exceed that limit, but should maintain an abnormal extent for\r\nmore than a decade, is in a high degree improbable.\r\n\r\nIt is far more probable that one of those gradual climatic changes, of\r\nwhich geology has shown the magnitude and meteorology has illustrated\r\nthe slowness, here finds a manifestation. The observed change is\r\napparently abrupt, and even saltatory; but of this we cannot be\r\ncertain, since it is impossible from a record of only thirty years\r\nto eliminate the limited oscillation. It is quite conceivable that\r\nwere such elimination effected, the residual change would appear as a\r\ncontinuous and equable increase of the lake. However that may be, a\r\ncertain degree of rapidity of change is necessarily involved, for the\r\nclimatic change which is able in a decade to augment by a sixth part\r\nthe mean area of evaporation cannot be of exceeding slowness. If we\r\ncan ascertain how great a change would be demanded, it will be well to\r\ncompare it with such changes as have been observed in other parts of\r\nthe country, and see whether its magnitude is such as to interfere with\r\nits assumption.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing winds of Utah are westerly, and it may be said in a\r\ngeneral way that the atmosphere of the drainage basin of Great Salt\r\nLake is part of an air current moving from west to east. The basin\r\nhaving no outlet, the precipitation of rain and snow within its limits\r\nmust be counter-balanced by the evaporation. The air current must on\r\nthe average absorb the same quantity of moisture that it discharges.\r\nPart of the absorption is from land surfaces and part from water, the\r\nlatter being the more rapid.\r\n\r\nIf, now, the equilibrium be disturbed by an augmented humidity of the\r\ninflowing air, two results ensue. On the one hand the precipitation\r\nis increased, and on the other, the absorbent power of the air being\r\nless, the rate of evaporation is diminished. In so dry a climate the\r\nprecipitation is increased in greater ratio than the humidity, and the\r\nrate of evaporation is diminished in less ratio; while of the increased\r\nprecipitation an increased percentage gathers in streams and finds its\r\nway to the lake. That reservoir, having its inflow augmented and its\r\nrate of evaporation decreased, gains in volume and grows in breadth\r\nuntil the evaporation from the added expanse is sufficient to restore\r\nthe equilibrium. Giving attention to the fact that the lake receives\r\na greater percentage of the total downfall than before, and to the\r\nfact that its rate of evaporation is at the same time diminished it is\r\nevident that the resultant augmentation of the lake surface is more\r\nthan proportional to the augmentation of the precipitation.\r\n\r\nWe are therefore warranted in assuming that an increase of humidity\r\nsufficient to account for the observed increase of 17 per cent. in the\r\nsize of the lake would modify the rainfall by less than 17 per cent.\r\nThe actual change of rainfall cannot be estimated with any degree of\r\nprecision, but from a review of such data as are at my command I am led\r\nto the opinion that an allowance of 10 per cent. would be as likely to\r\nexceed as to fall short, while an allowance of 7 per cent. would be at\r\nthe verge of possibility.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall of some other portions of the continent has been recorded\r\nwith such a degree of thoroughness and for such a period that a term\r\nof comparison is afforded. In his discussion of the precipitation of\r\nthe United States, Mr. Schott has grouped the stations by climatic\r\ndistricts, and deduced the annual means for the several districts.\r\nMaking use of his table on page 154 (Smithsonian Contributions, No.\r\n222), and restricting my attention to the results derived from five\r\nor more stations, I select the following extreme cases of variation\r\nbetween the mean annual rainfalls of consecutive decades. District I\r\ncomprises the sea coast from Maine to Virginia, and the record includes\r\nfive or more stations from 1827 to 1867. From the decade 1831-’40 to\r\nthe decade 1841-’50 the rainfall increased 6 per cent. District II\r\ncomprises the state of New York and adjacent regions, and includes\r\nfive or more stations from 1830 to 1866. From the decade 1847-’56 to\r\nthe decade 1857-’66 the rainfall increased 9 per cent. District IV\r\ncomprises the Ohio Valley and adjacent regions, and includes five\r\nor more stations from 1837 to 1866. From decade 1841-’50 to decade\r\n1851-’60 the rainfall diminished 8 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe case, then, stands that the best comparable districts and epochs\r\nexhibit extreme fluctuations from decade to decade of from 6 to 9 per\r\ncent, while the rise of Great Salt Lake implies a fluctuation of about\r\n10 per cent. But before deciding that the hypothetical fluctuation\r\nin Utah is extraordinary, consideration should be given to the fact\r\nthat in the dry climate of that region a given change in humidity will\r\nproduce a relatively great change in rainfall, while an identical\r\nchange of rainfall, measured in inches, acquires an exaggerated\r\nimportance when expressed as the percentage of a small total rainfall.\r\nGiving due weight to these considerations, I am led to conclude\r\nthat the assumed increase of rainfall in Utah is not of incredible\r\nmagnitude, and consequently that the hypothesis which ascribes the rise\r\nof the lake to a change of climate should be regarded as tenable. It\r\nby no means follows that it is proven, and so long as it depends on an\r\nassumption the truth of which is merely possible, but not established,\r\nit can claim no more than a provisional acceptance.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to add that, so far as I entertain the idea of a change of\r\nclimate, I do so without referring the change to any local cause. It is\r\nfrequently asserted that the cultivated lands of Utah “draw the rain”;\r\nor that the prayers of the religious community inhabiting the territory\r\nhave brought water to their growing crops; or that the telegraph\r\nwires and iron rails which gird the country have in some way caused\r\nelectricity to induce precipitation; but none of these agencies seem to\r\nbe competent. The weather of the globe is a complex whole, each part of\r\nwhich reacts on every other, and each part of which depends on every\r\nother. The weather of Utah is an interdependent part of the whole, and\r\ncannot be referred to its causes until the entire subject is mastered.\r\nThe simpler and more immediate meteoric reactions have been so far\r\nanalyzed that their results are daily predicted; but the remote sources\r\nof our daily changes, as well as the causes of the greater cycles of\r\nchange, are still beyond our reach. Although withdrawn from the domain\r\nof the unknowable, they remain within that of the unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THEORY OF HUMAN AGENCIES.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining theory of value is the one advocated by Professor\r\nPowell: that the phenomena are to be ascribed to the modification of\r\nthe surface of the earth by the agency of man. The rise of the lake\r\nand the increase of streams have been observed since the settlement of\r\nthe country by the white man, and the sage brush on the old storm line\r\nshows that they had not been carried to the same extent at any previous\r\nperiod in the century. They have coincided in time with the extension\r\nof the operations of civilization; and the settlers attach this idea to\r\nthe facts in detail as well as in general. They have frequently told me\r\nthat wherever and whenever a settlement was established, there followed\r\nin a few years an increase of the water supply, and these statements\r\nhave been supported by such enumerations of details that they seem\r\nworthy of consideration. If they are well founded, the secret of the\r\nchange will surely be found among the modifications incident to the\r\noperations of the settler.\r\n\r\nSimilar testimony was gathered by Prof. Cyrus Thomas in 1869 in regard\r\nto the increase of water supply at the western edge of the plains, and\r\nthe following conclusion appears in his report to Dr. Hayden (page 237\r\nof the reprint of Dr. Hayden’s reports for 1867, 1868, and 1869):\r\n\r\n All this, it seems to me, must lead to the conclusion that since the\r\n territory [Colorado] has begun to be settled, towns and cities built\r\n up, farms cultivated, mines opened, and roads made and travelled,\r\n there has been a gradual increase of moisture. Be the cause what it\r\n may, unless it is assumed that there is a cycle of years through which\r\n there is an increase, and that there will be a corresponding decrease,\r\n the fact must be admitted upon this accumulated testimony. I therefore\r\n give it as my firm conviction that this increase is of a permanent\r\n nature, and not periodical, and that it has commenced within eight\r\n years past, and that it is in some way connected with the settlement\r\n of the country, and that as the population increases the moisture will\r\n increase.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the confidence of Professor Thomas’s conclusions, he\r\nappears to have reached them by a leap, for he makes no attempt to\r\nanalyze the influence of civilized man on nature to which he appeals.\r\nBefore we accept his results, it will be necessary to inquire in what\r\nway the white man has modified the conditions by which the water supply\r\nis controlled.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate this inquiry, an attempt will be made to give a new and\r\nmore convenient form to our expression of the amount of change for\r\nwhich it is necessary to account in the basin of Great Salt Lake.\r\n\r\nThe inflow of the lake is derived chiefly from three rivers, and is\r\nsusceptible of very exact determination. Thorough measurement has not\r\nyet been made, but there has been a single determination of each river\r\nand minor stream, and a rough estimate can be based on them. The Bear\r\nand the Weber were measured in October, 1877, and I am led by the\r\nanalogy of other streams and by the characters of the river channels\r\nto judge that the mean volume of the Bear for the year was twice its\r\nvolume at the date of measurement, and that of the Weber four times.\r\nThe mean flow of the Jordan can be estimated with more confidence, for\r\nreasons which will appear in a following chapter. The “supply from\r\nother sources” mentioned in the table includes all the creeks that flow\r\nfrom the Wasatch Mountains, between Draper and Hampden, together with\r\nthe Malade River, Blue Creek, the creeks of Skull and Tooele Valleys,\r\nand the line of springs that encircles the lake.\r\n\r\n +---------------------------------------------+----------+-----------+\r\n |                                             | Measured | Estimated |\r\n |                                             |volume in |mean volume|\r\n |                    Rivers, etc.             | feet per |  in feet  |\r\n |                                             | second.  |per second.|\r\n +---------------------------------------------+----------+-----------+\r\n |Bear River, measured October 4, 1877,        |          |           |\r\n |       at Hampden Bridge                     |   2,600  |   5,200   |\r\n |Weber River, measured October 11, near Ogden |     500  |   2,000   |\r\n |Jordan River, measured July 8, near Draper   |   1,275  |   1,000   |\r\n |Supply from other sources                    |    --    |   1,800   |\r\n |                                             +----------+-----------+\r\n |    Total                                    |    --    |  10,000   |\r\n |Deduct the water used in irrigation          |    --    |     600   |\r\n |                                             +----------+-----------+\r\n |    Remainder                                |    --    |   9,400   |\r\n +---------------------------------------------+----------+-----------+\r\n\r\nThe result expresses the mean inflow to the lake in 1877, and is\r\nprobably not more than 25 per cent. in error. The total inflow for the\r\nyear would suffice to cover the lake to a depth of 60 inches. In the\r\nsame year (or from October, 1876, to October, 1877) the lake fell 6¹⁄₂\r\ninches, showing that the loss by evaporation was by so much greater\r\nthan the gain by inflow. The total annual evaporation of inflowing\r\nwater may therefore be placed provisionally at 66¹⁄₂ inches. If we add\r\nto this the rain and snow which fall on the lake, we deduce a total\r\nannual evaporation of about 80 inches of water; but for the present\r\npurpose it will be more convenient to consider the former figure.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the Salt Lake basin is about 28,500 square miles. The\r\nwestern portion, amounting to 12,500 miles, sends no water to the\r\nlake, yielding all its rainfall to evaporation within its own limits.\r\nThe remaining 16,000 miles includes both plains and mountains, and\r\nits tribute is unequal. To supply 66¹⁄₂ inches annually to the whole\r\narea of the lake, 2,125 miles, it must yield a sheet of water with an\r\naverage thickness of 8.83 inches. In former times, when the lake had an\r\narea of only 1,820 miles, the yield of the same area was 7.43 inches.\r\nThe advance from 7.43 to 8.83, or the addition of 1 inch and 4 tenths\r\nto the mean outflow of the district, is the phenomenon to be accounted\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nAll the water that is precipitated within the district as rain or snow\r\nreturns eventually to the air, but different portions are returned\r\nin different ways. Of the snow, a portion is melted and a portion is\r\nevaporated without melting. Of the melted snow and the rain, a part is\r\nabsorbed by vegetation and soil, and is afterward reabsorbed by the\r\nair; another part runs from the surface in rills, and a third part\r\nsinks into the underlying formations and afterward emerges in springs.\r\nThe streams which arise from springs and rills are again divided. Part\r\nof the water is evaporated from the surfaces of the streams and of\r\nfresh water lakes interrupting their courses. Another part enters the\r\nadjacent porous soils, and either meets in them the air by which it is\r\nslowly absorbed, or else so saturates them as to produce marshes from\r\nwhich evaporation progresses rapidly at the surface. The remainder\r\nflows to Great Salt Lake, and is in time evaporated from its surface.\r\nThe lesser portion of the precipitation enters the lake; the greater\r\nis intercepted on the way and turned back to the air. Whatever man\r\nhas done to clear the way for the flowing water has diminished local\r\nevaporation and helped to fill the lake. Whatever he has done to\r\nincrease local evaporation has tended to empty the lake.\r\n\r\nThe white man has modified the conditions of drainage, first, by the\r\ncultivation of the soil; second, by the raising of herds; and, third,\r\nby the cutting of trees.\r\n\r\n1. By plowing the earth the farmer has rendered it more porous and\r\nabsorbent, so that a smaller percentage of the passing shower runs off.\r\nHe has destroyed the native vegetation, and replaced it by another\r\nthat may or may not increase the local evaporation; but this is of\r\nlittle moment, because his operations have been conducted on gentle\r\nslopes which in their natural condition contributed very little to the\r\nstreams. It is of greater import that he has diverted water already\r\naccumulated in streams, and for the purposes of irrigation has spread\r\nit broadly upon the land, whence it is absorbed by the air. In this way\r\nhe has diminished the inflow of the lake.\r\n\r\nIncidental to the work of irrigation has been what is known as the\r\n“opening out” of springs. Small springs are apt to produce bogs from\r\nwhich much water is evaporated, and it has been found that by running\r\nditches through them the water can be gathered into streams instead.\r\nThe streams of water thus rescued from local dissipation are consumed\r\nin irrigation during a few months of the year, but for the remainder\r\ngo to swell the rivers, and the general tendency of the work is to\r\nincrease the inflow of the lake. A similar and probably greater result\r\nhas been achieved by the cutting of beaver dams. In its natural\r\ncondition every stream not subject to violent floods was ponded from\r\nend to end by the beaver. Its water surface was greatly expanded,\r\nand its flood plains were converted into marshes. The irrigator has\r\ndestroyed the dams and drained the marshes.\r\n\r\nThere are a few localities where drainage has been resorted to for the\r\nreclamation of wet hay lands, and that work has the same influence on\r\nthe discharge to the lake.\r\n\r\n2. The area affected by grazing is far greater than that affected by\r\nfarming. Cattle, horses, and sheep have ranged through all the valleys\r\nand upon all the mountains. Over large areas they have destroyed the\r\nnative grasses, and they have everywhere reduced them. Where once the\r\nwater from rain was entangled in a mesh of vegetation and restrained\r\nfrom gathering into rills, there is now only an open growth of bushes\r\nthat offer no obstruction. Where once the snows of autumn were spread\r\non a non-conducting mat of hay, and wasted by evaporation until the\r\nsunshine came to melt them, they now fall upon naked earth and are\r\nmelted at once by its warmth.\r\n\r\nThe treading of many feet at the boggy springs compacts the spongy mold\r\nand renders it impervious. The water is no longer able to percolate,\r\nand runs away in streams. The porous beds of brooklets are in the same\r\nway tramped and puddled by the feet of cattle, and much water that\r\nformerly sank by the way is now carried forward.\r\n\r\nIn all these ways the herds tend to increase the inflow of the lake,\r\nand there is perhaps no way in which they have lessened it.\r\n\r\n3. The cutting of trees for lumber and fence material and fuel has\r\nfurther increased the streams. By the removal of foliage, that share\r\nof the rain and snow which was formerly caught by it and thence\r\nevaporated, is now permitted to reach the ground, and some part of it\r\nis contributed to the streams. Snow beds that were once shaded are\r\nnow exposed to the sun, and their melting is so accelerated that a\r\ncomparatively small proportion of their contents is wasted by the wind.\r\nMoreover, that which is melted is melted more rapidly, and a larger\r\nshare of it is formed into rills.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it appears that the white man causes a greater percentage\r\nof the precipitation in snow to be melted and a less percentage to be\r\nevaporated directly. This follows from the destruction of trees and of\r\ngrass. By reducing the amount of vegetation he gives a freer flow to\r\nthe water from rain and melting snow and carries a greater percentage\r\nof it to streams, while a smaller percentage reaches the air by\r\nevaporation from the soil. By the treading of his cattle he diminishes\r\nthe leakage of the smaller water channels, and conserves the streams\r\ngathered there. By the same means and by the digging of drains he\r\ndries the marshes and thereby enlarges the streams. In all these ways\r\nhe increases the outflow of the land and the inflow of the lake. He\r\ndiminishes the inflow in a notable degree only by irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe direct influence of irrigation upon the inflow is susceptible of\r\nquantitative statement. Four hundred square miles of land in Utah and\r\nIdaho are fertilized by water that would otherwise flow to the lake,\r\nand they dissipate annually a layer of about 20 inches. To supply these\r\n20 inches the drainage district of 16,000 miles yields an average layer\r\nof 0.5 inch, and this yield is in addition to the 1.4 inches required\r\nto maintain the increase of lake surface. The total augmentation of the\r\nannual water supply is therefore represented by a sheet 1.9 inches in\r\ndepth covering the entire district.\r\n\r\nThe indirect influence of irrigation, and the influences exerted by the\r\ngrazier and the woodman, cannot be estimated from any existing data,\r\nbut of their tendencies there can be no question. To some extent they\r\ndiminish local evaporation, and induce a larger share of the rainfall\r\nto gather in the streams; and to one who has contrasted the district in\r\nquestion with similar districts in their virgin condition, there seems\r\nno extravagance in ascribing to them the whole of the observed change.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the Mississippi and on the Atlantic coast, it has been\r\nobserved that the floods of rivers are higher than formerly, and that\r\nthe low stages are lower, and the change has been ascribed by Ellet\r\nand others to the destruction of the native vegetation. The removal\r\nof forests and of prairie grasses is believed to facilitate the rapid\r\ndischarge from the land of the water from rain and melted snow, and to\r\ndiminish the amount stored in the soil to maintain springs. In an arid\r\ncountry like Utah, where the thirst of the air is not satisfied by the\r\nentire rainfall, any influence that will increase the rapidity of the\r\ndischarge must also increase the amount of the discharge. The moisture\r\nthat lingers on the surface is lost.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it may be most wise to hold the question an open one\r\nwhether the water supply of the lake has been increased by a climatic\r\nchange or by human agency. So far as we now know, neither theory is\r\ninconsistent with the facts, and it is possible that the truth includes\r\nboth. The former appeals to a cause that may perhaps be adequate, but\r\nis not independently known to exist. The latter appeals to causes known\r\nto exist but quantitatively undetermined.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to turn to the economic bearings of the question, for\r\nthe theories best sustained by facts are those most flattering to the\r\nagricultural future of the Arid Region. If the filling of the streams\r\nand the rise of the lake were due to a transient extreme of climate,\r\nthat extreme would be followed by a return to a mean condition, or\r\nperhaps by an oscillation in the opposite direction, and a large share\r\nof the fields now productive would be stricken by drought and returned\r\nto the desert.\r\n\r\nIf the increase of water supply is due to a progressive change of\r\nclimate forming part of a long cycle, it is practically permanent, and\r\nfuture changes are more likely to be in the same advantageous direction\r\nthan in the opposite. The lands now reclaimed are assured for years to\r\ncome, and there is every encouragement for the work of utilizing the\r\nexisting streams to the utmost.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, if the increase of water supply is due to the changes\r\nwrought by the industries of the white man, the prospect is even\r\nbetter. Not only is every gain of the present assured for the future,\r\nbut future gain may be predicted. Not alone are the agricultural\r\nfacilities of this district improving, but the facilities in the whole\r\nRocky Mountain Region are improving and will improve. Not only does the\r\nsettler incidentally and unconsciously enhance his natural privilege,\r\nbut it is possible, by the aid of a careful study of the subject, to\r\ndevise such systematic methods as shall render his work still more\r\neffectual.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      FARMING WITHOUT IRRIGATION.\r\n\r\nThe general rule that agriculture in Utah is dependent on artificial\r\nirrigation finds exception in two ways. First, there are some\r\nlocalities naturally irrigated; and, second, there is at least one\r\nlocality of which the local climate permits dry farming.\r\n\r\nAlong the low banks of many streams there are fertile strips of\r\nland. The soil is in every such case of a porous nature, and water\r\nfrom the stream percolates laterally and rises to the roots of the\r\nplants. Nearly all such lands are flooded in spring time, and they\r\nare usually devoted to hay as an exclusive crop; but some of them are\r\nabove ordinary floods and are suited for other uses. It rarely happens,\r\nhowever, that they are farmed without some irrigation, for the reason\r\nthat the use of the convenient water render the harvest more secure and\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nThe same fertility is sometimes induced by subterranean waters which\r\nhave no connection with surface streams. In such cases there is\r\nusually, and perhaps always, an impervious subsoil which retains\r\npercolating water near the surface. A remarkable instance of this sort\r\nis known at the western base of the Wasatch Mountains. A strip of land\r\nfrom 20 to 40 rods broad, and marking the junction of the mountain\r\nslope with the plain, has been found productive from Hampton’s Bridge\r\nto Brigham City, a distance of 18 miles. In some parts it has been\r\nirrigated, with the result of doubling or trebling the yield, but where\r\nwater has not been obtained, the farmer has nevertheless succeeded in\r\nextracting a living. A similar but narrower belt of land lies at the\r\neastern base of the Promontory range, and a few others have been found.\r\nIn each locality the proximity of subterranean water to the surface is\r\nshown by the success of shallow wells, and there is evidently a natural\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\nThere is one region, however, where natural irrigation is out of the\r\nquestion, but where crops have nevertheless been secured. Bear River\r\n“City” was founded by a company of Danes, who brought the water of the\r\nMalade River to irrigate their fields. After repeated experiment they\r\nbecame satisfied that the water was so brackish as to be injurious\r\ninstead of beneficial, and ceased to use it; and for a number of years\r\nthey have obtained a meagre subsistence by dry farming. A district\r\nlying south of Ogden and east of Great Salt Lake, and known as “the\r\nSand Ridge”, has recently been brought in use, and in 1876 and 1877\r\nwinter wheat was harvested with a yield variously reported as from 10\r\nto 15 bushels per acre. This success is regarded by some of the older\r\nsettlers as temporary and delusive, for it is said to have depended on\r\nexceptional spring rains; but the majority of the community have faith\r\nin its permanence, and the experiment is being pushed in many valleys.\r\nIn Bear River City and on the Sand Ridge water is not found by shallow\r\nwells, and the land is naturally dry. In these localities, and, so\r\nfar as I am aware, in all others where dry land has been successfully\r\nfarmed, the soil is sandy, and this appears to be an essential\r\ncondition. Success has moreover been restricted to the line of valleys\r\nwhich lie at the western base of the Wasatch Mountains and near Great\r\nSalt Lake.\r\n\r\nThis last feature depends, as I conceive, on a local peculiarity of\r\nclimate. The general movement of the atmosphere is from west to east,\r\nand the air which crosses the lake is immediately lifted from its level\r\nto the crest of the Wasatch. Having acquired from the lake an addition\r\nto its quota of moisture, it has less power of absorption and a greater\r\ntendency to precipitation than the atmosphere in general, and it\r\nconfers on the eastern shore of the lake a climate of exceptional\r\nhumidity.\r\n\r\nThe character of this climate is clearly indicated by the assemblage of\r\nthe observed facts in regard to precipitation. Through the kindness of\r\nProf. Joseph Henry I have been permitted to examine the rain records\r\naccumulated by the Smithsonian Institution, including not only those\r\nwhich have been embodied in the published “Tables,” but the more recent\r\ndata to be included in the forthcoming second edition. The following\r\ntable shows the mean annual precipitation for all stations in Utah,\r\nNevada, Wyoming, and Colorado, which have a record two years or more\r\nin extent, together with certain other facts for comparison. The\r\ntemperature means are taken from the Smithsonian Temperature Tables and\r\nthe United States Signal Service Reports.\r\n\r\n +-------------------------+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+\r\n |                         |       |   Mean     |      |     |         |\r\n |                         | Annual|Temperature.|Height|     | Length  |\r\n |          Station.       |precip-|------+-----|above |Lati-|   of    |\r\n |                         | ita-  |Spr-  |Sum- | sea. |tude.| record. |\r\n |                         | tion. | ing. | mer.|      |     |         |\r\n +-------------------------+-------+------+-----+------+-----+---------+\r\n |                         |Inches.|  Deg.

As a\r\ngeneral rule, the localities of greatest precipitation in the Rocky\r\nMountain Region have so great altitude that their summer temperature\r\ndoes not permit agriculture, but Salt Lake City, with an altitude\r\n1,000 feet below the average of the 24 stations, and a temperature 4°\r\nabove the average, has a rainfall 11 inches greater than the average;\r\nand Camp Douglas, 3° warmer than the average and 250 feet lower, has\r\na rainfall 5 inches greater. If the two stations are compared with\r\nthose which lie nearest them, the contrast is still more striking. Camp\r\nHalleck, 130 miles west of the lake, and 600 feet higher than Camp\r\nDouglas, has a rainfall of 11 inches only. Fort Bridger, 90 miles east\r\nof the lake and 1,600 feet higher than Camp Douglas, has a rainfall of\r\n8 inches. Camp Floyd, 30 miles south of the lake and sheltered from its\r\ninfluence by mountains, receives only 7¹⁄₃ inches. But Salt Lake City\r\nand Camp Douglas, lying between the lake and the Wasatch Range, record\r\nrespectively 24.8 and 18.8 inches.\r\n\r\nIn fine, it appears that the climate of the eastern shore of Great Salt\r\nLake is decidedly exceptional and approximates in humidity to that of\r\nCentral Kansas. The fact that it admits of dry farming gives no warrant\r\nfor the belief that large areas in the Arid Region can be cultivated\r\nwithout irrigation, but serves rather to confirm the conclusion that\r\nthe limit to remunerative dry farming is practically drawn by the\r\nisohyetal line of 22 inches. Even in this most favored district the\r\nyield is so small that it can be doubled by irrigation, and eventually\r\nwater ditches will be carried to nearly all the land that has yet been\r\nplowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n       CERTAIN IMPORTANT QUESTIONS RELATING TO IRRIGABLE LANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE UNIT OF WATER USED IN IRRIGATION.\r\n\r\nThe unit of water employed in mining as well as manufacturing\r\nenterprises in the west is usually the inch, meaning thereby the amount\r\nof water which will flow through an orifice one inch square. But in\r\npractice this quantity is very indefinite, due to the “head” or amount\r\nof pressure from above. In some districts this latter is taken at six\r\ninches. Another source of uncertainty exists in the fact that increase\r\nin the size of the orifice and increase in the amount of flow do not\r\nprogress in the same ratio. An orifice of one square inch will not\r\nadmit of a discharge one-tenth as great as an orifice of ten square\r\ninches. An inch of water, therefore, is variable with the size of the\r\nstream as well as with the head or pressure. For these reasons it\r\nseemed better to take a more definite quantity of water, and for this\r\npurpose the _second-foot_ has been adopted. By its use the volume of\r\na stream will be given by stating the number of cubic feet which the\r\nstream will deliver per second.\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE QUANTITATIVE VALUE OF WATER IN IRRIGATION.\r\n\r\nIn general, throughout the Arid Region the extent of the irrigable land\r\nis limited by the water supply; the arable lands are much greater than\r\nthe irrigable. Hence it becomes necessary, in determining the amount of\r\nirrigable lands with reasonably approximate accuracy, to determine the\r\nvalue of water in irrigation; that is, the amount of land which a given\r\namount of water will serve.\r\n\r\nAll questions of concrete or applied science are more or less complex\r\nby reason of the multifarious conditions found in nature, and this is\r\neminently true of the problem we are now to solve, namely, how much\r\nwater must an acre of land receive by irrigation to render agriculture\r\nthereon most successful; or, how much land will a given amount of water\r\nadequately supply. This will be affected by the following general\r\nconditions, namely, the amount of water that will be furnished by\r\nrainfall, for if there is rainfall in the season of growing crops,\r\nirrigation is necessary only to supply the deficiency; second, the\r\ncharacter of the soil and subsoil. If the conditions of soil are\r\nunfavorable, the water supply may be speedily evaporated on the one\r\nhand, or quickly lost by subterranean drainage on the other; but if\r\nthere be a soil permitting the proper permeation of water downward and\r\nupward, and an impervious subsoil, the amount furnished by artificial\r\nirrigation will be held in such a manner as to serve the soil bearing\r\ncrops to the greatest extent; and, lastly, there is a great difference\r\nin the amount of water needed for different crops, some requiring less,\r\nothers more.\r\n\r\nUnder these heads come the general complicating conditions. In the\r\nmountainous country the areal distribution of rainfall is preëminently\r\nvariable, as the currents of air which carry the water are deflected in\r\nvarious ways by diverse topographic inequalities. The rainfall is also\r\nexceedingly irregular, varying from year to year, and again from season\r\nto season.\r\n\r\nBut in all these varying conditions of time and space there is one\r\nfact which must control our conclusions in considering most of the\r\nlands of the Arid Region, namely: any district of country which we may\r\nbe studying is liable for many seasons in a long series to be without\r\nrainfall, when the whole supply must be received from irrigation.\r\nSafety in agricultural operations will be secured by neglecting the\r\nrainfall and considering only the supply of water to be furnished by\r\nartificial methods; the less favorable seasons must be considered;\r\nin the more favorable there will be a surplus. In general, this\r\nstatement applies throughout the Arid Region, but there are some\r\nlimited localities where a small amount of rainfall in the season of\r\ngrowing crops seems to be constant from year to year. In such districts\r\nirrigation will only be used to supply deficiencies.\r\n\r\nThe complicating conditions arising from soil and subsoil are many.\r\nExperience has already shown that there are occasional conditions of\r\nsoil and subsoil so favorable that the water may be supplied before the\r\ngrowing season, and the subsoil will hold it for weeks, or even months,\r\nand gradually yield the moisture to the overlying soil by slow upward\r\npercolation or capillary attraction during the season when growing\r\ncrops require its fertilizing effect. When such conditions of soil and\r\nsubsoil obtain, the construction of reservoirs is unnecessary, and the\r\nwhole annual supply of the streams may be utilized. On the other hand,\r\nthere are extremely pervious soils underlaid by sands and gravels,\r\nwhich speedily carry away the water by a natural under drainage. Here\r\na maximum supply by irrigation is necessary, as the soils must be kept\r\nmoist by frequent flowing. Under such conditions the amount of water to\r\nbe supplied is many fold greater than under the conditions previously\r\nmentioned, and between these extremes almost infinite variety prevails.\r\n\r\nPractical agriculture by irrigation has also demonstrated the fact\r\nthat the wants of different crops are exceedingly variable, some\r\nrequiring many fold the amount of others. This is due in part to the\r\nlength of time necessary to the maturing of the crops, in part to the\r\namount of constant moisture necessary to their successful growth. But\r\nby excluding the variability due to rainfall, and considering only\r\nthat due to differences of soils and crops, and by taking advantage\r\nof a wide experience, a general average may be obtained of sufficient\r\naccuracy for the purposes here in view.\r\n\r\nIn examining the literature of this subject it was found that the\r\nexperience in other countries could not be used as a guide in\r\nconsidering our problems. In general, irrigation in Europe and Asia\r\nis practiced only to supply deficiencies, and the crops there raised\r\nare only in part the same as with us, and the variation on account of\r\nthe crops is very great. Certain statements of Marsh in his “Man and\r\nNature” have been copied into the journals and reports published in\r\nthe United States, and made to do duty on many occasions; but these\r\nstatements are rather misleading, as the experience of farmers in the\r\nArid Region has abundantly demonstrated. The writers who have used\r\nthem have in general overestimated the quantitative value of water in\r\nirrigation. The facts in Italy, in Spain, in Grenada, and India are\r\nvaluable severally for discussion in the countries named, but must be\r\nused in a discussion of the arid lands of the United States with much\r\ncare. It seemed better, under these circumstances, to determine the\r\nquantitative value of water in irrigation in Utah from the experience\r\nof the farmers of Utah. Irrigation has there been practiced for about\r\nthirty years, and gradually during that time the area of land thus\r\nredeemed has been increased, until at present about 325,000 acres\r\nof land are under cultivation. A great variety of crops have been\r\ncultivated--corn, wheat, oats, rye, garden vegetables, orchard trees,\r\nfruits, vines, etc., etc.; and even the fig tree and sugar cane are\r\nthere raised.\r\n\r\nDuring the past six or seven years I have from time to time, as\r\noccasion was afforded, directed my attention to this problem, but being\r\nexceedingly complex, a very wide range of facts must be considered in\r\norder to obtain a reasonably approximate average. During the past year\r\nthe task of more thoroughly investigating this subject was delegated\r\nto Mr. Gilbert. The results of his studies appear in a foregoing\r\nchapter, written by him; but it may be stated here that he has reached\r\nthe conclusion that a continuous flow of one cubic foot of water\r\nper second, _i. e._, a _second-foot_ of water, will, in most of the\r\nlands of Utah, serve about 100 acres for the general average of crops\r\ncultivated in that country; but to secure that amount of service from\r\nthe water very careful and economic methods of irrigation must be\r\npracticed. At present, there are few instances where such economic\r\nmethods are used. In general, there is a great wastage, due to badly\r\nconstructed canals, from which the water either percolates away or\r\nbreaks away from time to time; due, also, to too rapid flow, and also\r\nto an excessive use of the water, as there is a tendency among the\r\nfarmers to irrigate too frequently and too copiously, errors corrected\r\nonly by long experience.\r\n\r\nThe studies of Mr. Gilbert, under the circumstances, were quite\r\nthorough, and his conclusions accord with my own, derived from a more\r\ndesultory but longer study of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n     AREA OF IRRIGABLE LAND SOMETIMES NOT LIMITED BY WATER SUPPLY.\r\n\r\nWhile, as a general fact, the area of arable land is greater than the\r\narea of irrigable land, by reason of the insufficient supply of water,\r\nyet in considering limited tracts it may often be found that the supply\r\nof water is so great that only a part of it can be used thereon. In\r\nsuch cases the area of irrigable land is limited by the extent to which\r\nthe water can be used by proper engineering skill. This is true in\r\nconsidering some portions of Utah, where the waters of the Green and\r\nColorado cannot all be used within that territory. Eventually these\r\nsurplus waters will be used in southern California.\r\n\r\n\r\n              METHOD OF DETERMINING THE SUPPLY OF WATER.\r\n\r\nTo determine the amount of irrigable land in Utah, it was necessary to\r\nconsider the supply; that is, to determine the amount of water flowing\r\nin the several streams. Again, this quantity is variable in each stream\r\nfrom season to season and from year to year. The irrigable season is\r\nbut a small portion of the year. To utilize the entire annual discharge\r\nof the water, it would be necessary to hold the surplus flowing in the\r\nnon-growing season in reservoirs, and even by this method the whole\r\namount could not be utilized, as a great quantity would be lost by\r\nevaporation. As the utilization of the water by reservoirs will be to\r\na great extent postponed for many years, the question of immediate\r\npractical importance is resolved into a consideration of the amount of\r\nwater that the streams will afford during the irrigating season. But\r\nin the earlier part of the season the flow in most of the streams in\r\nthis western region is great, and it steadily diminishes to the end of\r\nthe summer. Earlier in the season there is more water, while for the\r\naverage of crops the greater amount is needed later.\r\n\r\nThe practical capacity of a stream will then be determined by its flow\r\nat the time when that is least in comparison with the demands of the\r\ngrowing crops. This will be called the critical period, and the volume\r\nof water of the critical period will determine the capacity of the\r\nstream. The critical period will vary in different parts of the region\r\nfrom the latter part of June until the first part of August. For the\r\npurposes of this discussion it was only necessary to determine the\r\nflow of the water during the critical period. This has been done by\r\nvery simple methods. Usually in each case a section of the stream has\r\nbeen selected having the least possible variation of outline and flow.\r\nA cross-section of the stream has been measured, and the velocity of\r\nflow determined. With these factors the capacity of the streams has\r\nbeen obtained. In some cases single measurements have been made; in\r\nothers several at different seasons, rarely in different years. The\r\ndetermination of the available volume of the several streams by such\r\nmethods is necessarily uncertain, especially from the fact that it has\r\nnot always been possible to gauge the streams exactly at the critical\r\nperiod; and, again, the flow in one season may differ materially from\r\nthat in another. But as the capacity of a stream should never be rated\r\nby its volume in seasons of abundant flow, we have endeavored as far\r\nas possible to determine the capacity of the streams in low water\r\nyears. Altogether the amount of water in the several streams has been\r\ndetermined crudely, and at best the data given must be considered\r\ntolerable approximations. In considering the several streams experience\r\nmay hereafter discover many errors, but as the number of determinations\r\nis great, the average may be considered good.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF DETERMINING THE EXTENT OF IRRIGABLE LAND UNLIMITED BY WATER\r\n                                SUPPLY.\r\n\r\nIn the few cases where the water supply is more than sufficient to\r\nserve the arable lands, the character of the problem is entirely\r\nchanged, and it becomes necessary then to determine the area to which\r\nthe waters can be carried. These problems are hypsometric; relative\r\naltitudes are the governing conditions. The hypsometric methods\r\nwere barometric and angular; that is, from the barometric stations\r\nvertical angles were taken and recorded to all the principal points\r\nin the topography of the country; mercurial and aneroid barometers\r\nwere used, chiefly the former; the latter to a limited extent, for\r\nsubsidiary work. Angular measurements were made with gradientors to a\r\nslight extent, but chiefly with the orograph, an instrument by which a\r\ngreat multiplicity of angles are observed and recorded by mechanical\r\nmethods. This instrument was devised by Professor Thompson for the use\r\nof the survey, and has been fully described in the reports on the\r\ngeographical operations. To run hypsometric lines with spirit levels\r\nwould have involved a great amount of labor and been exceedingly\r\nexpensive, and such a method was entirely impracticable with the means\r\nat command, but the methods used give fairly approximate results, and\r\nperhaps all that is necessary for the purposes to be subserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE SELECTION OF IRRIGABLE LANDS.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that the area of arable lands greatly exceeds the\r\nirrigable, or the amount which the waters of the streams will serve,\r\na wide choice in the selection of the latter is permitted. The\r\nconsiderations affecting the choice are diverse, but fall readily\r\ninto two classes, viz: physical conditions and artificial conditions.\r\nThe mountains and high plateaus are the great aqueous condensers; the\r\nmountains and high plateaus are also the reservoirs that hold the water\r\nfed to the streams in the irrigating season, for the fountains from\r\nwhich the rivers flow are the snow fields of the highlands. After the\r\nstreams leave the highlands they steadily diminish in volume, the loss\r\nbeing due in part to direct evaporation, and in part to percolation\r\nin the sands from which the waters are eventually evaporated. In like\r\nmanner irrigating canals starting near the mountains and running\r\nfar out into the valleys and plains rapidly diminish in the volume\r\nof flowing water. Looking to the conservation of water, it is best\r\nto select lands as high along the streams as possible. But this\r\nconsideration is directly opposed by considerations relating to\r\ntemperature; the higher the land the colder the climate. Where the\r\ngreat majority of streams have their sources, agriculture is impossible\r\non account of prevailing summer frosts; the lower the altitude the more\r\ngenial the temperature; the lower the land the greater the variety of\r\ncrops which can be cultivated; and to the extent that the variety of\r\ncrops is multiplied the irrigating season is lengthened, until the\r\nmaximum is reached in low altitudes and low latitudes where two crops\r\ncan be raised annually on the same land. In the selection of lands,\r\nas governed by these conditions, the higher lands will be avoided on\r\nthe one hand because of the rigor of the climate; if these conditions\r\nalone governed, no settlement should be made in Utah above 6,500 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea, and in general still lower lands should be\r\nused; on the other hand the irrigable lands should not be selected at\r\nsuch a distance from the source of the stream as to be the occasion of\r\na great loss of water by direct and indirect evaporation. For general\r\nclimatic reasons, the lands should be selected as low as possible;\r\nfor economy of water as high as possible; and these conditions in the\r\nmain will cause the selections to be made along the middle courses of\r\nthe streams. But this general rule will be modified by minor physical\r\nconditions relating to soil and slope--soils that will best conserve\r\nthe water will be selected, and land with the gentlest slopes will be\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nIn general, the descent of the streams in the arid land is very great;\r\nfor this reason the flood plains are small, that is, the extent of\r\nthe lands adjacent to the streams which are subject to overflow at\r\nhigh water is limited. In general, these flood-plain lands should not\r\nbe chosen for irrigation, from the fact that the irrigating canals\r\nare liable to be destroyed during flood seasons. Where the plan of\r\nirrigation includes the storage of the water of the non-growing season,\r\nby which all the waters of the year are held under control, the\r\nflood-plain lands can be used to advantage, from the fact that they\r\nlie in such a way as to be easily irrigated and their soils possess\r\nelements and conditions of great fertility.\r\n\r\nOther locally controlling conditions are found in selecting the most\r\nadvantageous sites for the necessary water works.\r\n\r\nThese are the chief physical factors which enter into the problem, and\r\nin general it will be solved by considering these factors only; but\r\noccasionally artificial conditions will control.\r\n\r\nThe mining industries of the Arid Region are proportionately greater\r\nthan in the more humid country. Where valuable mines are discovered\r\ntowns spring up in their immediate vicinity, and they must be served\r\nwith water for domestic purposes and for garden culture. When possible,\r\nagriculture will be practiced in the immediate vicinity for the purpose\r\nof taking advantage of the local market. In like manner towns spring\r\nup along the railroads, and agriculture will be carried on in their\r\nvicinity. For this and like reasons the streams of the Arid Region will\r\noften be used on lands where they cannot be made the most available\r\nunder physical conditions, and yet under such circumstances artificial\r\nconditions must prevail.\r\n\r\nIn the indication of specific areas as irrigable on the accompanying\r\nmap of Utah, it must be considered that the selections made are\r\nbut tentative; the areas chosen are supposed to be, under all the\r\ncircumstances, the most available; but each community will settle\r\nthis problem for itself, and the circumstances which will control\r\nany particular selection cannot be foretold. It is believed that the\r\nselections made will be advantageous to the settler, by giving him the\r\nopinions of men who have made the subject a study, and will save many\r\nmistakes.\r\n\r\nThe history of this subject in Utah is very instructive. The greater\r\nnumber of people in the territory who engage in agriculture are\r\norganized into ecclesiastical bodies, trying the experiment of communal\r\ninstitutions. In this way the communal towns are mobile. This mobility\r\nis increased by the fact that the towns are usually laid out on\r\nGovernment lands, and for a long time titles to the land in severalty\r\nare not obtained by the people. It has been the custom of the church\r\nto send a number of people, organized as a community, to a town site\r\non some stream to be used in the cultivation of the lands, and rarely\r\nhas the first selection made been final. Luxuriant vegetation has\r\noften tempted the settlers to select lands at too great an altitude,\r\nand many towns have been moved down stream. Sometimes selections have\r\nbeen made too far away from the sources of the streams, and to increase\r\nthe supply of water, towns have been moved up stream. Sometimes lands\r\nof too great slope have been chosen, and here the waters have rapidly\r\ncut deep channels and destroyed the fields. Sometimes alkaline lands\r\nare selected and abandoned, and sometimes excessively sandy lands have\r\ncaused a change to be made; but the question of the best sites for the\r\nconstruction of works for controlling and distributing the water has\r\nusually determined the selection of lands within restricted limits.\r\n\r\nTo a very slight extent indeed have artificial conditions controlled\r\nin Utah; the several problems have generally been solved by the\r\nconsideration of physical facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     INCREASE IN THE WATER SUPPLY.\r\n\r\nIrrigation has been practiced in different portions of the Arid Region\r\nfor the last twenty-five or thirty years, and the area cultivated\r\nby this means has been steadily increasing during that time. In\r\nCalifornia and New Mexico irrigation has been practiced to a limited\r\nextent for a much longer time at the several Catholic missions under\r\nthe old Spanish regime. In the history of the settlement of the several\r\ndistricts an important fact has been uniformly observed--in the first\r\nyears of settlement the streams have steadily increased in volume.\r\nThis fact has been observed alike in California, Utah, Colorado, and\r\nwherever irrigation has been practiced. As the chief development of\r\nthis industry has been within the last fifteen years, it has been a\r\nfact especially observed during that time. An increase in the water\r\nsupply, so universal of late years, has led to many conjectures and\r\nhypotheses as to its origin. It has generally been supposed to result\r\nfrom increased rainfall, and this increased rainfall now from this, now\r\nfrom that, condition of affairs. Many have attributed the change to the\r\nlaying of railroad tracks and construction of telegraph lines; others\r\nto the cultivation of the soil, and not a few to the interposition of\r\nDivine Providence in behalf of the Latter Day Saints.\r\n\r\nIf each physical cause was indeed a _vera causa_, their inability to\r\nproduce the results is quite manifest. A single railroad line has\r\nbeen built across the Arid Region from east to west, and a short\r\nnorth and south line has been constructed in Colorado, another in\r\nUtah, and several in California. But an exceedingly small portion of\r\nthe country where increase of water supply has been noticed has been\r\nreached by the railroads, and but a small fraction of one per cent. of\r\nthe lands of the Arid Region have been redeemed by irrigation. This\r\nfully demonstrates their inadequacy. In what manner rainfall could be\r\naffected through the cultivation of the land, building of railroads,\r\ntelegraph lines, etc., has not been shown. Of course such hypotheses\r\nobtain credence because of a lack of information relating to the laws\r\nwhich govern aqueous precipitation. The motions of the earth on its\r\naxis and about the sun; the unequal heating of the atmosphere, which\r\ndecreases steadily from equator to poles; the great ocean currents\r\nand air currents; the distribution of land and water over the earth;\r\nthe mountain systems--these are all grand conditions affecting the\r\ndistribution of rainfall. Many minor conditions also prevail in\r\ntopographic reliefs, and surfaces favorable to the absorption or\r\nreflection of the sun’s heat, etc., etc., affecting in a slight degree\r\nthe general results. But the operations of man on the surface of the\r\nearth are so trivial that the conditions which they produce are of\r\nminute effect, and in presence of the grand effects of nature escape\r\ndiscernment. Thus the alleged causes for the increase of rainfall fail.\r\nThe rain gauge records of the country have been made but for a brief\r\nperiod, and the stations have been widely scattered, so that no very\r\ndefinite conclusions can be drawn from them, but so far as they are of\r\nvalue they fail to show any increase. But if it be true that increase\r\nof the water supply is due to increase in precipitation, as many have\r\nsupposed, the fact is not cheering to the agriculturist of the Arid\r\nRegion. The permanent changes of nature are secular; any great sudden\r\nchange is ephemeral, and usually such changes go in cycles, and the\r\nopposite or compensating conditions may reasonably be anticipated.\r\n\r\nFor the reasons so briefly stated, the question of the origin and\r\npermanence of the increase of the water supply is one of prime\r\nimportance to the people of the country. If it is due to a temporary\r\nincrease of rainfall, or any briefly cyclic cause, we shall have to\r\nexpect a speedy return to extreme aridity, in which case a large\r\nportion of the agricultural industries of the country now growing up\r\nwould be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe increase is abundantly proved; it is a matter of universal\r\nexperience. The observations of the writer thereon have been widely\r\nextended. Having examined as far as possible all the facts seeming\r\nto bear on the subject, the theory of the increase of rainfall was\r\nrejected, and another explanation more flattering to the future of\r\nagriculture accepted.\r\n\r\nThe amount of water flowing in the streams is but a very small part of\r\nthat which falls from the heavens. The greater part of the rainfall\r\nevaporates from the surfaces which immediately receive it. The\r\nexceedingly dry atmosphere quickly reabsorbs the moisture occasionally\r\nthrown down by a conjunction of favoring conditions. Any changes in\r\nthe surfaces which receive the precipitation favorable to the rapid\r\ngathering of the rain into rills and brooks and creeks, while taking\r\nto the streams but a small amount of that precipitated, will greatly\r\nincrease the volume of the streams themselves, because the water in the\r\nstreams bears so small a proportion to the amount discharged from the\r\nclouds. The artificial changes wrought by man on the surface of the\r\nearth appear to be adequate to the production of the observed effects.\r\nThe destruction of forests, which has been immense in this country for\r\nthe past fifteen years; the cropping of the grasses, and the treading\r\nof the soil by cattle; the destruction of the beaver dams, causing a\r\ndrainage of the ponds; the clearing of drift wood from stream channels;\r\nthe draining of upland meadows, and many other slight modifications,\r\nall conspire to increase the accumulation of water in the streams, and\r\nall this is added to the supply of water to be used in irrigation.\r\n\r\nStudents of geology and physical geography have long been aware of\r\nthese facts. It is well known that, under the modifying influences\r\nof man, the streams of any region redeemed from the wilderness are\r\nchanged in many important characteristics. In flood times their volumes\r\nare excessively increased and their powers of destruction multiplied.\r\nIn seasons of drought, some streams that were perennial before man\r\nmodified the surface of the country become entirely dry; the smaller\r\nnavigable streams have their periods of navigation shortened, and the\r\ngreat rivers run so low at times that navigation becomes more and\r\nmore difficult during dry seasons; in multiplied ways these effects\r\nare demonstrated. While in the main the artificial changes wrought by\r\nman on the surface are productive of bad results in humid regions,\r\nthe changes are chiefly advantageous to man in arid regions where\r\nagriculture is dependent upon irrigation, for here the result is to\r\nincrease the supply of water. Mr. Gilbert, while engaged during the\r\npast season in studying the lands of Utah, paid especial attention to\r\nthis subject, and in his chapter has more thoroughly discussed the\r\ndiverse special methods by which increase in the flow of the streams is\r\ncaused by the changes wrought by man upon the surface of the earth. His\r\nstatement of facts is clear, and his conclusions are deemed valid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                           THE LANDS OF UTAH\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PHYSICAL FEATURES.\r\n\r\nA zone of mountains and high plateaus extends from the northern nearly\r\nto the southern boundary of Utah Territory. The Wasatch Mountains\r\nconstitute the northern portion of this zone, the High Plateaus the\r\nsouthern. This central zone has a general altitude above the sea\r\nof from nine to eleven thousand feet. Many peaks are higher, a few\r\nreaching an altitude of about twelve thousand feet. On the other hand\r\nmany cañons and valleys have been excavated by the running waters far\r\nbelow the general level thus indicated.\r\n\r\nThe Uinta Mountains stretch eastward from the midst of the Wasatch.\r\nThis region is a lofty table land carrying many elevated peaks whose\r\nsummits are from twelve to nearly fourteen thousand feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea. This is the highest portion of Utah, and among its\r\npeaks are the culminating points.\r\n\r\nSouth from the Uinta Region, and from the southern extremity of the\r\nWasatch Mountains, another elevated district extends east-southeast\r\nbeyond the borders of Utah. This table land is cut in twain by two\r\ngreat gorges of the Green River--the Cañon of Desolation and Gray\r\nCañon. The eastern portion is called East Tavaputs Plateau, the western\r\nWest Tavaputs Plateau.\r\n\r\nBetween the Uinta Mountains and the Tavaputs table land is the\r\nUinta-White Basin, a low synclinal valley, drained by the Uinta and its\r\nramifications on the west, and the lower portion of the White River on\r\nthe east.\r\n\r\nThe district of country lying south of the Tavaputs table land, and\r\neast and south of the High Plateaus, is traversed by many deep cañons.\r\nThis is the Cañon Land of Utah. In its midst the Green and Grand unite\r\nto form the Colorado. The Price and San Rafael are tributary to the\r\nGreen. The Fremont, Escalante, Paria, Kanab, and Virgin are directly\r\ntributary to the Colorado from the north and west. From the east the\r\nSan Juan flows to the Colorado, but its drainage area is not included\r\nin our present discussion.\r\n\r\nWest of the lofty zone lie low, arid valleys, interrupted by short\r\nand abrupt ranges of mountains whose naked cliffs and desolate peaks\r\noverlook the still more desolate valleys. These short longitudinal\r\nranges are but a part of the Basin Ranges, a mountain system extending\r\nthrough Nevada and northward into Idaho and Oregon. That portion of\r\nthe Basin Range System which lies in Utah, and which we now have under\r\nconsideration, is naturally divided into two parts, the northern\r\nembracing the drainage area of Great Salt Lake, the southern embracing\r\nthe drainage area of Sevier Lake, giving the Great Salt Lake District\r\nand the Sevier Lake District.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, the grand districts into which Utah is naturally\r\ndivided are as follows: The Wasatch Mountains and the High Plateaus,\r\nconstituting the lofty zone above mentioned; the Uinta Mountains, the\r\nTavaputs table lands, the Uinta-White Basin, the Cañon Lands, the\r\nSevier Lake Basin, and the Great Salt Lake Basin, the two latter being\r\nfragments of the great Basin Range Province.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe eastern portion of the Territory of Utah is drained by the Colorado\r\nRiver by the aid of a number of important tributaries. The western\r\nportion is drained by streams that, heading in the mountains and high\r\nplateaus of the central portion, find their way by many meanderings\r\ninto the salt lakes and desert sands to the westward.\r\n\r\nConsidered with reference to its drainage, Utah may thus be divided\r\ninto two parts--the Colorado drainage area and the Desert drainage\r\narea; the former is about two-fifths, the latter three-fifths of the\r\narea of the territory.\r\n\r\nAll of the Wasatch Mountains lie west of the drainage crest; a part of\r\nthe High Plateaus are drained to the Colorado, a part to the deserts.\r\nThis great water divide, commencing north of the Pine Valley Mountains\r\nin the southwest corner of the territory, runs north of the Colob\r\nPlateau and enters the district of the High Plateaus. It first runs\r\neastward along the crest or brink of the Pink Cliffs that bound the\r\nMarkagunt and Pauns-a-gunt Plateaus, and then north and east in many\r\nmeandering ways, now throwing a plateau into the western drainage, and\r\nnow another into the eastern, until it reaches the western extremity of\r\nthe Tavaputs table lands. Thence it runs around the western end of the\r\nUinta Valley, throwing the Tavaputs table lands, the Uinta Valley, and\r\nUinta Mountains into the Colorado drainage, and the Wasatch Mountains\r\ninto the Desert drainage.\r\n\r\nThese two regions are highly differentiated in orographic structure\r\nand other geological characteristics. The sedimentary formations of\r\nthe eastern region are in large part of Cenozoic and Mesozoic age,\r\nthough Paleozoic rocks appear in some localities. The Cenozoic and\r\nMesozoic formations are largely composed of incoherent sands and shales\r\nwith intercalated beds of indurated sandstone and limestone. The\r\ngreat geological displacements are chiefly by faults and monoclinal\r\nflexures, by which the whole country has been broken up into many broad\r\nblocks, so that the strata are horizontal or but slightly inclined,\r\nexcept along the zones of displacement by which the several blocks are\r\nbounded. Here the strata, when not faulted, are abruptly flexed, and\r\nthe rocks dip at high angles.\r\n\r\nThe Uinta Mountains are storm carved from an immense uplifted block.\r\nThe mountains of the Cañon Lands are isolated and volcanic. In the\r\nHigh Plateaus sedimentary beds are covered by vast sheets of lava.\r\nThe sedimentary beds exposed in the mountains of the Desert region\r\nare of Paleozoic age, and many crystalline schists appear, while\r\nthe sedimentary beds exposed in the valleys are Post-Tertiary. The\r\ncrystalline schists and ancient sedimentaries of the mountains are\r\noften extensive masses of extravasated rocks. The prevailing type of\r\norographic structure is that of monoclinal ridges of displacement.\r\nBlocks of strata have been turned up so as to incline at various\r\nangles, and from their upturned edges the mountains have been carved.\r\nBut these monoclinal ridges are much complicated by mountain masses\r\nhaving an eruptive origin.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern districts the materials denuded from the mountains and\r\nplateaus have been carried to the sea, but in the western districts\r\nthe materials carried from the mountains are deposited in the adjacent\r\nvalleys, so that while the mountains are composed of rocks of great\r\nage, the rocks of the valleys are of recent origin. In that geological\r\nera known as the Glacial epoch the waters of a great lake spread over\r\nthese valleys, and the mountains stood as islands in the midst of a\r\nfresh-water sea. For the history of this lake we are indebted to the\r\nresearches of Mr. Gilbert. It had its outlet to the north by way of the\r\nShoshoni River and the Columbia to the North Pacific. These later beds\r\nof the valleys are in part the sediments of Lake Bonneville, the great\r\nlake above mentioned, and in part they are subaërial gravels and sands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Wasatch system of mountains is composed of abrupt ranges crowned\r\nwith sharp peaks. The several minor ranges and groups of peaks\r\ninto which it is broken are separated only in part by structural\r\ndifferences, since ridges with homogeneous structure are severed by\r\ntransverse valleys. The drainage of the whole area occupied by the\r\nWasatch Mountains is westward to the Great Salt Lake. The streams\r\nthat head in the western end of the Uinta Mountains and West Tavaputs\r\nPlateau cut through the Wasatch Mountains.\r\n\r\nGreat Salt Lake and its upper tributary, Utah Lake, exist by virtue of\r\nthe presence of the Wasatch Mountains, for the mountains wring from the\r\nclouds the waters with which the lakes are supplied.\r\n\r\nWalled by high ridges and peaks, many elevated valleys are found.\r\nIn the midsummer months these valleys are favored with a pleasant,\r\ninvigorating climate. Occasionally showers of rain fall. Vegetation is\r\nvigorous. The distant mountain slopes bear forests of spruce, pine,\r\nand fir; the broken foot hills are often covered by low, ragged piñon\r\npines and cedars; and the flood plains of the streams are natural\r\nmeadows. About the springs and streamlets groves of aspen stand, and\r\nthe streams are bordered with willows, box elders, and cottonwoods. Now\r\nand then a midsummer storm comes, bringing hail, and even snow. When\r\nthe short summer ends, the aspen and box elder foliage turns to gold\r\nflecked with scarlet; the willows to crimson and russet; the meadows\r\nare quickly sered, and soon the autumn verdure presents only the somber\r\ntints of the evergreens; early snows fall, and the whole land is soon\r\ncovered with a white mantle, except that here and there bleak hills\r\nand rugged peaks are swept bare by the winds. The brief, beautiful\r\nsummer is followed by a long, dreary winter, and during this winter of\r\nsnowfall are accumulated the waters that are to be used in fertilizing\r\nthe valleys away below in the border region between the mountains and\r\nthe desert basins.\r\n\r\nFrom the Wasatch on the north to the Colob on the south are elevated\r\ntables, in general bounded by bold, precipitous escarpments. The lands\r\nabove are highly and sharply differentiated from the lands below in\r\nclimate, vegetation, soil, and other physical characters. These high\r\nplateaus are covered with sheets and beds of lava, and over the lava\r\nsheets are scattered many volcanic cinder cones. The higher plateaus\r\nbear heavy forests of evergreens, and scattered through the forests are\r\nmany little valleys or meadow glades. The gnarled, somber forests are\r\noften beset with fallen timber and a vigorous second growth, forming\r\ntogether a dead and living tangle difficult to penetrate. But often the\r\nforest aisles are open from glade to glade, or from border cliff to\r\nborder cliff. In the midst of the glades are many beautiful lakelets,\r\nand from the cliffs that bound the plateaus on every hand the waters\r\nbreak out in innumerable springs.\r\n\r\nHere, also, a brief summer is followed by a long winter, and through\r\nits dreary days the snow is gathered which fills the lakelets above and\r\nfeeds the springs along the bordering cliffs. The springs of the cliffs\r\nare the fountains of the rivers that are to fertilize the valleys lying\r\nto the east, south, and west.\r\n\r\nThe Uinta Mountains constitute an east and west range. From a single\r\ngreat uplift, nearly 200 miles long and from 40 to 50 miles wide,\r\nvalleys and cañons have been carved by rains and rivers, and table\r\nlands and peaks have been left embossed on the surface. Along its\r\nmiddle belt from east to west the peaks are scattered in great\r\nconfusion, but in general the highest peaks are near the center of the\r\nrange. The general elevation descends abruptly both on the north and\r\nsouth margins of the uplift, and at the crest of each abrupt descent\r\nthere are many limestone ridges and crags. Between these ridges and\r\ncrags that stand along the bordering crests, and the peaks that stand\r\nalong the meandering watershed, there are broad tables, some times\r\ncovered with forests, sometimes only with grass.\r\n\r\nThis is a third region of short summers and long winters, where the\r\nwaters are collected to fertilize the valleys to the north and south.\r\n\r\nAway to the southward are the twin plateaus, East and West Tavaputs,\r\nsevered by the Green River. These plateaus culminate at the Brown\r\nCliffs, where bold escarpments are presented southward.\r\n\r\nOutlying the Brown Cliffs are the Book Cliffs. These, also, are\r\nescarpments of naked rock, with many salient and reëntrant angles and\r\noutlying buttes. The beds of which they are composed are shales and\r\nsandstones of many shades of blue, gray, and buff. In the distance,\r\nand softly blended by atmospheric haze, the towering walls have an\r\nazure hue. Everywhere they are elaborately water carved, and the bold\r\nbattlements above are buttressed with sculptured hills. In 1869, when\r\nthe writer first saw this great escarpment, he gave it the name of\r\nthe Azure Cliffs, but an earlier traveler, passing by another route\r\nacross the country, had seen them in the distance, and, seizing\r\nanother characteristic feature, had called them the Book Mountains.\r\nGunnison saw, however, not a range of mountains, but the escarped edge\r\nof a plateau, and this escarpment we now call the Book Cliffs. From\r\nthe Brown Cliffs northward these plateaus dip gently north to the\r\nUinta-White Basin. From the very crest of the Brown Cliffs the drainage\r\nis northward.\r\n\r\nThis is a fourth region of short summers and long winters, where the\r\nmoisture is collected to fertilize adjacent lands; but the altitude\r\nis not great enough nor the area large enough to accumulate a large\r\nsupply of water, and the amount furnished by the Tavaputs Plateaus is\r\ncomparatively small.\r\n\r\nSuch are the lofty regions of Utah that furnish water to irrigate the\r\nlowlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                TIMBER.\r\n\r\nIn these elevated districts is found all the timber of commercial\r\nvalue. This is well shown on the map. The map also exhibits the fact\r\nthat many portions of the elevated districts are devoid of timber,\r\nit having been destroyed by fire, as explained in a former chapter.\r\nDoubtless, if fires could be prevented, the treeless areas would in\r\ndue time be again covered with forests, but in such a climate forest\r\ngrowth is slow. At present, the treeless areas will afford valuable\r\nsummer pasturage for cattle, and doubtless such pasturage would be\r\nadvantageous to the growth of new forests, by keeping down the grasses\r\nin which in part the fires spread. It has already been shown that, to\r\na great extent, the fires which destroy the forests are set by Indians\r\nwhile on their hunting excursions. The removal of the Indians from the\r\ncountry will further protect the forests. Eventually, the better class\r\nof timber lands will fall into the hands of individual owners, who\r\nwill be interested in protecting their property from devastation by\r\nthis fierce element. By all of these means the standing timber will be\r\npreserved for economic uses; but it will be a long time before complete\r\nimmunity from fires will be secured.\r\n\r\nThe demand for lumber will never be very great. A variety of causes\r\nconspire to this end. The adjacent country will sustain but a small\r\nagricultural population, because the irrigable lands are of limited\r\nextent. The people of the lowlands will eventually supply themselves\r\nwith fuel by cultivating timber along the water courses and by using\r\nthe coal so abundant in some portions of Utah. The lumber will never be\r\ncarried to a foreign market because of the expense of transportation:\r\nfirst, it will be expensive to get it down from the highlands to the\r\nlowlands, and, second, there are no navigable streams by which lumber\r\nmay be cheaply transported from the country. In general, the lumber is\r\nof inferior quality, and cannot successfully compete for a permanent\r\nplace in the markets of the world. But there will be a demand for\r\nlumber for building and fencing purposes in the valleys, and for mining\r\npurposes in the mountains.\r\n\r\nIf the timber region can be protected from fire, the supply of timber\r\nwill equal the demand.\r\n\r\nFrom the brief description given above, it will be seen that the timber\r\nregion will never support agriculture. Much of it is mountainous and\r\ninhospitable, and the climate is cold. The timber region is ever to be\r\nsuch; mining industries will slightly encroach on it on the one hand,\r\nand pasturage industries on the other, but lumbermen will control the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe forests of these upper regions are monotonous, as the variety of\r\ntree life is very small. All of the timber trees proper are coniferous,\r\nand belong to the pine, fir, and juniper families. The pine of chief\r\nvalue is _Pinus ponderosa_, locally distinguished as the “Long leaved\r\npine”; the wood is very heavy and coarse grained, but is suitable for\r\nthe ruder building and mining purposes. It is usually found on the\r\nslopes between eight and nine thousand feet above the level of the sea.\r\nIt attains a large size, and is a stately tree, contrasting grandly\r\nwith the darker and smaller firs that usually keep it company.\r\n\r\n_Pinus aristata_ is of no commercial value, as it is much branched\r\nand spreading with limbs near the base; it grows on the crags at an\r\naltitude of from nine to eleven thousand feet.\r\n\r\n_Pinus flexilis_ grows at the same altitude as the last mentioned, and\r\noften shows a similar habit of growth. On the southern plateaus it is\r\nless branched and has a tolerably straight trunk, but it is too small\r\nand scarce to be important as timber. It is highly resinous, and is\r\ncalled “Pitch pine.”\r\n\r\n_Pinus monticola_, or Sugar pine, is found on the southern plateaus,\r\nbut is not abundant, and rarely attains milling size.\r\n\r\n_Pinus edulis_ is the well known “Piñon pine”. It covers the foot\r\nhills and less elevated slopes adjacent to the river valleys. The\r\ntree is low, diffusely branched and scrubby, and is of no use for\r\nlumber; but the wood is well supplied with resin and makes an excellent\r\nfuel, for which purpose it is extensively used in consequence of its\r\naccessibility.\r\n\r\nThere are three valuable species of Abies, namely: _A. Douglasii_, _A.\r\nconcolor_, and _A. Engelmanni_. _Abies Douglasii_, or Douglas’ spruce,\r\nbears some resemblance to the eastern spruce, _A. Canadensis_, but it\r\nis a finer tree, and the wood is much superior. Though rather light,\r\nit is tough and exceedingly durable. The heart wood is red, from which\r\ncircumstance lumbermen distinguish it as the “Red pine”. In building\r\nit is used for all the heavier parts, as frames, joists, rafters,\r\netc., and it makes excellent flooring. Its value is still further\r\nenhanced from the fact that it occupies a belt of from seven to nine\r\nthousand feet altitude, and thus is easily obtained. It may readily be\r\ndistinguished by its cones, the bracts of which are trifurcate, sharp,\r\npointed, and conspicuously exserted, and they are unlike those of any\r\nother species.\r\n\r\n_Abies concolor_, known in Utah as the “Black balsam”, grows at about\r\nthe same altitude as the last mentioned species, and though rather\r\ncross-grained makes good lumber, being quite durable and strong. From\r\nits silvery foliage, the leaves being glaucous on both sides, this tree\r\nis known to tourists as the “White silver fir”. Lumbermen sometimes\r\ncall it the “Black gum”, the wood being very dark colored.\r\n\r\n_Abies Engelmanni_, or Engelmann’s spruce, occupies the highest\r\nelevations, and constitutes the only timber above 11,000 feet in\r\naltitude. Above 11,500 feet it is reduced to a dwarf. On the terraces\r\nof the high plateaus, at about 10,000 feet altitude, it appears to\r\nflourish best, and here it becomes a large, beautiful tree. The leaves\r\nare needle shaped, and thus differ from both the preceding species. The\r\ntrunks are straight and free from limbs or knots, making fine saw logs.\r\nThe wood is white and soft, but fine grained and durable, and being\r\neasily worked is held in high esteem for all the lighter uses, such as\r\nsash, doors, etc. Its place in the lumber industries of Utah is about\r\nthe same as that of the “White pine” (_Pinus Strobus_) in the east.\r\nLumbermen usually call it “White pine”. Because of the altitude of its\r\nhabitat it is difficult to obtain, yet it is systematically sought, and\r\nlarge amounts are yearly manufactured into lumber; it also makes good\r\nshingles.\r\n\r\n_Abies Menziesii_, or Menzies’s spruce, usually called “Spruce” by\r\nlumbermen of the country, is botanically very similar to the species\r\nlast described, but the cones are larger and the leaves sharper\r\npointed. It bears a large quantity of cones, which are generally\r\naggregated near the top, obscuring the foliage, and giving the trees a\r\npeculiar tawny appearance. The wood is light, white, and fine grained,\r\nand would rival that of the last named species but for the fact that\r\nthe trunk has a number of slight curves, so that it is impossible to\r\nobtain good saw logs of sufficient length from it. Its habitat is along\r\nthe cañons from seven to nine thousand feet altitude, and seems to end\r\nabout where _A. Engelmanni_ begins. It is, however, a smaller tree, and\r\nless abundant.\r\n\r\n_Abies subalpina_ is of little value as a timber tree; the wood is\r\nsoft and spongy, from which circumstance it is locally known as\r\n“Pumpkin pine”, but the more appropriate name of “White balsam” is also\r\napplied to distinguish it from _A. concolor_, which is called “Black\r\nbalsam”. This species grows high up on the mountains and plateaus,\r\ngenerally from nine to eleven thousand feet. It is very tall, often\r\nattaining a height of 80 or 90 feet. Its trunk is straight and limbless\r\nfor a great distance. This species has been but little known to\r\nbotanists heretofore, from the fact that it has been confounded with\r\n_A. grandis_, but Mr. Engelmann decides, from specimens collected by\r\nMr. L. F. Ward, that it must be considered as a new species.\r\n\r\n_Abies amabilis_ and _Abies grandis_, spruces resembling the “White\r\nbalsam” in their general appearance, occur in the Wasatch Mountains,\r\nbut are not abundant.\r\n\r\n_Juniperus Californicus_, var. _Utahensis_, or White cedar, is very\r\nabundant over the foot hills and lower mountain slopes, and, like the\r\npiñon pine, is much used for fire wood. It has also the characteristic\r\ndurability of the junipers, and makes excellent fence posts. It grows\r\nlow, is diffusely branched, and is valueless for milling purposes.\r\n\r\n_Juniperus Virginiana_, or Red cedar, is also found in this region. Its\r\nhabitat is near the streams and at moderate altitudes. It is said to\r\nlack the durable qualities for which it is noted at the east, and which\r\nseem to be transferred to the other species.\r\n\r\n_Populus angustifolia_, or Cottonwood, is the chief representative of\r\nthe poplar family in this region. The people of the country distinguish\r\ntwo varieties or species, the Black cottonwood and Yellow cottonwood.\r\nThe former is said to be useless for lumber, while the latter has some\r\nslight value. It forms no part of the forest proper, but fringes the\r\nlower reaches of the streams, rarely occurring higher in altitude than\r\n6,000 feet. Its rapid growth and its proximity to the irrigable lands\r\nmake it valuable for fuel, although it is not of superior quality.\r\n\r\n_Populus monilifera_, the Cottonwood of the Mississippi Valley, grows\r\nwith the above in the southern part of the Territory, and has about the\r\nsame value.\r\n\r\n_Populus tremuloides_, or Aspen, is found about the moist places on\r\nthe mountain sides, and often borders the glades of the plateaus. The\r\nlong poles which it furnishes are sometimes used for fencing purposes;\r\nit makes a fair fuel; the quantity found is small.\r\n\r\n_Acer grandidentata_, a species of Maple, abounds at the north as a\r\nbush, and rare individuals attain the rank of small trees. Its wood is\r\nhighly prized for the repair of machinery, but is too scarce to be of\r\ngreat service.\r\n\r\n_Negundo aceroides_, or Box elder, is found along the water courses in\r\nmany places. Sometimes along the larger streams it attains a height\r\nof 25 or 30 feet. It makes a good fuel, but is found in such small\r\nquantities as to be scarcely worthy of mention.\r\n\r\n_Quercus undulata_, or White oak, is very abundant as a bush, and\r\nsometimes attains a diameter of six or eight inches. It is too rare as\r\na tree to deserve more than mere mention.\r\n\r\n_Betula occidentalis_, a species of Birch, grows about the upland\r\nsprings and creeks. Its habit is bushlike, but it often has a height of\r\n20 feet, and it makes a tolerable fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Hackberry (_Celtis occidentalis_) and two species of Ash (_Fraxinus\r\ncoriacea_ and _F. anomala_) grow as small trees, but are exceedingly\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nThe above is a nearly complete list of the forest trees of Utah. The\r\nnumber of species is very small; aridity on the one hand, and cold on\r\nthe other, successfully repel the deciduous trees. The oak, hickory,\r\nash, etc., necessary to such a variety of industries, especially the\r\nmanufacture of agricultural machinery, must all be imported from more\r\nhumid regions. The coniferous trees, growing high among the rocks of\r\nthe upper regions and beaten by the cold storms of a long winter, are\r\nragged and gnarled, and the lumber they afford is not of the finest\r\nquality; and the finishing lumber for architectural purposes and\r\nfurniture must also be imported from more humid regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     IRRIGABLE AND PASTURE LANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          UINTA-WHITE BASIN.\r\n\r\nThe Uinta-White Valley is a deep basin inclosed by the Uinta Mountains\r\non the north and the Tavaputs highlands on the south. Eastward the\r\nbasin extends beyond the limits of Utah; westward the Uinta Mountains\r\nand West Tavaputs Plateau nearly inclose the head of the Uinta\r\nValley, but the space between is filled with a section of the Wasatch\r\nMountains. From the north, west, and south the Uinta Valley inclines\r\ngently toward the Duchesne River. Many streams come down from the north\r\nand from the south. In the midst of the valley there are some small\r\nstretches of bad lands.\r\n\r\nAlong the lower part of the Uinta and the Duchesne, and the lower\r\ncourses of nearly all the minor streams, large tracts of arable land\r\nare found, and from these good selections can be made, sufficient to\r\noccupy in their service all the water of the Uinta and its numerous\r\nbranches. The agricultural portion of the valley is sufficiently low to\r\nhave a genial climate, and all the crops of the northern States can be\r\ncultivated successfully.\r\n\r\nStretching back on every hand from the irrigable districts, the little\r\nhills, valleys, and slopes are covered with grasses, which are found\r\nmore and more luxuriant in ascending the plateaus and mountains, until\r\nthe peaks are reached, and these are naked.\r\n\r\nOn the north of the Uinta, and still west of the Green, the basin is\r\ndrained by some small streams, the chief of which is Ashley Fork.\r\nExcept near the lower course of Ashley Fork, this section of country\r\nis exceedingly broken; the bad lands and hogbacks are severed by deep,\r\nprecipitous cañons.\r\n\r\nFrom the east the White River enters the Green. Some miles up the\r\nWhite, a cañon is reached, and the country on either hand, stretching\r\nback for a long distance, is composed of rugged barren lands. But\r\nbetween the highlands and the Green, selections of good land can be\r\nmade, and the waters of the White can be used to serve them. From the\r\nWhite, south to the East Tavaputs Plateau, the grass lands steadily\r\nincrease in value to the summit of the Brown Cliffs. Many good springs\r\nare found in this region, and eventually this will be a favorite\r\ndistrict for pasturage farms.\r\n\r\nFine pasturage farms may be made on the southern slope of the Yampa\r\nPlateau, with summer pasturage above and winter pasturage below.\r\nAltogether, the Uinta-White Basin is one of the favored districts of\r\nthe west, with great numbers of cool springs issuing from the mountains\r\nand hills; many beautiful streams of clear, cold water; a large amount\r\nof arable land from which irrigable tracts may be selected; an\r\nabundance of fuel in the piñon pines and cedars of the foot hills; and\r\nbuilding timber farther back on the mountains and plateaus.\r\n\r\nThe whole amount of irrigable land is estimated at 280,320 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE CAÑON LANDS.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Tavaputs highlands, and east and south of the High\r\nPlateaus, the Cañon Lands of Utah are found. The lower course of the\r\nGrand, the lower course of the Green, and a large section of the\r\nColorado cuts through them, and the streams that head in the High\r\nPlateaus run across them. All the rivers, all the creeks, all the\r\nbrooks, run in deep gorges--narrow, winding cañons, with their floors\r\nfar below the general surface of the country. Many long lines of cliffs\r\nare found separating higher from lower districts. The hills are bad\r\nlands and alcove lands.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra la Sal and Henry Mountains are great masses of lava, wrapped\r\nin sedimentary beds, which are cut with many dikes. South of the High\r\nPlateaus great numbers of cinder cones are found.\r\n\r\nOn the Grand River there are some patches of land which can be served\r\nby the waters of that river. On the Green, in what is known as Gunnison\r\nValley, patches of good land can be selected and redeemed by the waters\r\nof that river.\r\n\r\nCastle Valley is abruptly walled on the west, north, and northeast\r\nby towering cliffs. East of its southern portion a region of towers,\r\nbuttes, crags, and rocklands is found, known as the San Rafael Swell.\r\nIn this valley there is a large amount of good land, and the numerous\r\nstreams which run across it can all be used in irrigation. Farther\r\nsouth, on the Fremont, Escalante, and Paria, some small tracts of\r\nirrigable land are found, and on the Kanab and Virgin there are limited\r\nareas which can be used for agricultural purposes. But all that portion\r\nof the cañon country south of Castle Valley and westward to the Beaver\r\nDam Mountains is exceedingly desolate; naked rocks are found, refusing\r\nfooting even to dwarfed cedars and piñon pines; the springs are\r\ninfrequent and yield no bountiful supply of water; its patches of grass\r\nland are widely scattered, and it has but little value for agricultural\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nA broad belt of coal land extends along the base of the cliffs from\r\nthe Tavaputs Plateau on the northeast to the Colob Plateau on the\r\nsouthwest. At the foot of the cliffs which separate the lowlands\r\nfrom the highlands, many pasturage farms may be made; the grass of\r\nthe lowlands can be used in the winter, and that of the highlands in\r\nsummer, and everywhere good springs of water may be found.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the irrigable lands in this district is estimated at\r\n213,440 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE SEVIER LAKE DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nThis district embraces all the country drained by the waters which flow\r\ninto the Sevier Lake, and the areas drained by many small streams which\r\nare quickly lost in the desert. The greater part of the irrigable land\r\nlies in the long, narrow valleys walled by the plateaus, especially\r\nalong the Sevier, Otter Creek, and the San Pete. The arable lands\r\ngreatly exceed the irrigable, and good selections may be made. Most of\r\nthe irrigable lands are already occupied by farmers, and the waters\r\nare used in their service. In the valleys among the high plateaus, and\r\nalong their western border, the grasses are good, and many pasturage\r\nfarms may be selected, and the springs and little streams that come\r\nfrom the plateau cliffs will afford an abundant supply of water. The\r\nsummits of the plateaus will afford an abundant summer pasturage.\r\n\r\nWestward among the Basin Ranges feeble and infrequent springs are\r\nfound; there is little timber of value, but the lower mountains and\r\nfoot hills have cedars and piñon pines that would be valuable for fuel\r\nif nearer to habitations. The cedar and piñon hills bear scant grasses.\r\nThe valleys are sometimes covered with sage, sometimes with grease\r\nwood, sometimes quite naked.\r\n\r\nThe amount of irrigable land in this district is estimated at 101,700\r\nacres.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE GREAT SALT LAKE DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nThis district has already become famous in the history of western\r\nagriculture, for here the Latter Day Saints first made “a home in the\r\nvalleys among the mountains”.\r\n\r\nThe rivers and creeks bring the waters down from the Wasatch Mountains\r\non the east. The high valleys among the mountains have to some extent\r\nbeen cultivated, and will hereafter be used more than at present for\r\nmeadow purposes. In general the people have selected their lands low\r\ndown, in order to obtain a more genial climate. Yet the irrigable\r\nlands are not very far from the mountains, as a glance at the map will\r\nreveal. Utah Lake constitutes a fine natural reservoir and discharges\r\nits waters into Salt Lake by the Jordan, and from its channel the\r\nwaters may be conducted over a large area of country. The waters of\r\nthe Weber and Bear Rivers, now flowing idly into the lake, will soon\r\nbe spread over extensive valleys, and the area of agricultural lands\r\nbe greatly increased. Westward the influence of the mountains in\r\nthe precipitation of moisture is soon lost, and beyond the lake an\r\nirreclaimable desert is found.\r\n\r\nNear to the mountains the grass lands are fair but they have been\r\noverpastured and greatly injured. Out among the Basin Ranges little\r\ngrass land of value is found.\r\n\r\nThe amount of irrigable land in this district is estimated at 837,660\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nThe lofty zone of mountains and table lands with arms stretching\r\neastward, with its culminating points among summer frosts and winter\r\nstorms, is the central region about which the human interests of the\r\ncountry gather. The timber, the water, the agricultural lands, the\r\npasturage lands, to a large extent the coal and iron mines, and to\r\nsome extent the silver mines, are all found in these higher regions or\r\nclinging closely to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               GRASSES.\r\n\r\nWhile the forests present but a few species of trees, the pasturage\r\nlands present a great variety of grasses. Between fifty and sixty\r\nspecies have been collected by parties connected with the survey\r\nunder the direction of the writer, and these are distributed among\r\ntwenty-six or twenty-seven genera. Most of them belong to the mountains\r\nor highlands, and are rich and sweet. Nearly all of them are bunch\r\ngrasses. The spaces by which the bunches are separated are bare or\r\noccupied with weeds and shrubs. This is often the case on the mountains\r\nand high plateaus. A continuous turf is never seen. Where a sward is\r\nseen in moist places, about springs and in glades, the verdure consists\r\nin chief part of other plants, sedges and reeds.\r\n\r\nOf the bunch grasses the _Poas_ are by far the most abundant. Of this\r\ngenus nine species were obtained, but this gives an inadequate idea\r\nof the variety. Of one species alone Dr. Vasey has enumerated nine\r\nvarieties, and advances the opinion that several will be eventually\r\nconsidered as species. They are found at all altitudes, mostly on\r\nthe slopes. Perhaps the most important single species in that region\r\nis the _Bouteloua oligostachya_, the so called “Circle grass”. It\r\nhas a peculiar habit of forming partial or complete circles on the\r\nground, with areas of bare ground in the center. These turfy rings\r\nare comparatively narrow, often not more than three or four inches\r\nin width, while the circles are from two to four feet in diameter.\r\nThe form is not always circular, but often assumes irregular shapes.\r\nThe grass is sweet and nutritious, but its chief value consists in\r\nits power to resist inclement seasons, as it cures standing, like the\r\n“Buffalo grass” of the Great Plains.\r\n\r\nAnother very valuable grass is the _Eriocoma cuspidata_, which is known\r\nby the name of “Sand grass”. It grows at much lower altitudes, and is\r\nproperly a valley grass. It has a solitary, scattering habit, or at\r\nleast the bunches are small and turfless. Horses and cattle select it\r\nwith care from among other species, and it seems especially nutritious.\r\nIt has a large black grain, which is often collected by the Indians for\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nA remarkable lowland grass is the Vilfa (_Sporobolis airoides_). It has\r\nsomething of the appearance of “Hair grass”, with a widely spreading\r\npurple panicle and large perennial roots. The old culms persist at\r\nthe base, and with the new ones form thick and almost woody tufts.\r\nThese tufts are scattered about in the strongly alkaline soils of the\r\nriver bottoms, and are extensively pastured by large herds of cattle.\r\nA marked characteristic of this grass, common, however, to several\r\nothers, is its power to take up saline matter, which gives to the whole\r\nplant a salty taste. The effect of this upon the stock feeding upon it\r\nis doubtful, judging from the conflicting reports of the inhabitants;\r\nbut it seems that when cattle are first pastured upon it they are\r\ninjured by the excess of salt, but that after a time they cease to be\r\ninjured by it. All of the so called “Salt grasses” are cropped to a\r\ngreater or less extent by stock.\r\n\r\nThe chief grasses of the elevated timber tracts belong to the genus\r\n_Bromus_. When young they are good, but they become stale and valueless\r\nwith age. The only grass that can compare with those of the eastern\r\nmeadows, and which forms a continuous sod and covers the ground with a\r\nuniform growth, is a variety of _Aira cæspitosa_, a red topped grass,\r\nwhich was found surrounding the small lakes of the mountains and\r\nplateaus, at elevations of 11,000 feet and over. This is an exceedingly\r\nbeautiful grass as it waves in the gentle breezes that fan the lakelets\r\nof the upper regions.\r\n\r\n_Phragmites communis_, the so called “Cane”, is common in the glades\r\nand sloughs; and, though large and rather dry, it furnishes the only\r\nverdure obtainable for months in severe seasons.\r\n\r\nMuch of the hay and pasturage of the country, which is there called\r\ngrass, consists of plants of different families. Notable among these\r\nare several species of _Carex_ (sedges), particularly _Carex Jamesii_,\r\nwhich springs up wherever artificial meadows are made by the system\r\nof flooding commonly practiced. The plants have large, strong,\r\nsubterranean root-stocks, forming a tangled mass which, when once\r\nestablished, cannot easily be eradicated. The leaves are broad and\r\ngrasslike, and, though coarse and comparatively insipid, form a good\r\nsward which can be mowed--a rare condition in that country; and hence\r\nsuch meadows are highly prized.\r\n\r\n_Juncus Balticus_, var. _montanus_, which has a blue color, terete\r\nculms, and tough fiber, and which the settlers call “Wire grass”, is\r\nvery abundant. It is cut for hay, and is said to serve a good purpose\r\nas such.\r\n\r\nThere are some shrubs that furnish excellent browsing, among which,\r\nperhaps, the grease wood takes the first rank. The sage brush,\r\n_Artemisia_, on the contrary, is seldom resorted to. There is one shrub\r\nto which great virtues are ascribed which may be mentioned in this\r\nconnection. This is the _Cercocarpus parvifolius_, which occupies the\r\nmountain sides for a wide zone of altitude. The foliage, though not\r\nstrictly evergreen, remains most of the winter, and is said to afford\r\nthe only food for horses and cattle that can be obtained during some\r\nseasons of deep snows. This shrub is a congener of the well known\r\nmountain mahogany, _C. ledifolius_, which grows at higher altitudes,\r\nand has truly evergreen foliage.\r\n\r\nThe small perennial plant _Eurotia lanata_, or “White sage”, found\r\ngrowing in the valleys and plains, is held in high esteem as winter\r\nfood for stock.\r\n\r\nThe growth of grass, even on the plateaus, is often scant; on the foot\r\nhills it becomes less, and farther away from the highlands it still\r\ndiminishes in quantity until absolute deserts are found. Most of the\r\ngrasses seem to protect themselves from the great aridity by growing\r\nin bunches. They appear to produce proportionately a greater amount\r\nof seeds than the grasses of the Humid Region, and their nutritive\r\nqualities, especially in winter, seems to be due thereto. In general,\r\nthe grasses seem to have large, strong stems, and are not so easily\r\nbroken down as those of the Humid Region, and the rains and snows by\r\nwhich they would be so broken down are infrequent. Again, for these\r\nreasons, the grasses, standing long after they are cut by frosts, cure\r\nthemselves, forming thereby a winter pasturage.\r\n\r\nThe irrigable lands of Utah will be discussed more thoroughly and\r\nin detail in subsequent chapters by Mr. G. K. Gilbert, who has made\r\nthe Great Salt Lake District his study; by Capt. C. E. Dutton, who\r\nhas prepared the chapter on the irrigable lands of the Sevier Lake\r\nDrainage, and by Prof. A. H. Thompson, who has written the chapter on\r\nthe irrigable lands of the Colorado Drainage.\r\n\r\nThe following is a table of the irrigable lands, arranged by districts,\r\nas discussed in the present chapter. The table is compiled from those\r\npresented in subsequent chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _Table of irrigable lands in Utah Territory._\r\n\r\n

SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n                           BY G. K. GILBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe field of my work in 1877 included so large a portion of the\r\ndrainage basin of Great Salt Lake and so little else that it has\r\nproved most convenient to report on all of that basin, or rather on\r\nthat part of it which lies within the Territory of Utah. In so doing,\r\nI have depended, for nearly all the lands draining to Utah Lake, upon\r\nthe data gathered by Mr. Renshawe, of this survey, in connection with\r\nhis topographic work. The remainder of the district, with very slight\r\nexception, I have myself visited.\r\n\r\nThe officials and citizens of the Territory have all freely contributed\r\nsuch information as I have sought, and have aided me in many ways; but\r\nI have been especially indebted to Mr. Martineau and Mr. Barton, the\r\nsurveyors of Cache and Davis Counties; to Mr. Fox, the territorial\r\nsurveyor; and to the Hon. A. P. Rockwood, the statistician of the\r\nDeseret Agricultural Society. Mr. Rockwood prepared a statistical\r\nreport on the Territory in 1875, which has been of great service to me,\r\nand he has kindly placed at my disposal the manuscript details of his\r\nwork as well as the published summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  METHOD AND SCOPE OF INVESTIGATION.\r\n\r\nWhere agriculture is dependent upon irrigation, the extent of land that\r\ncan be put to agricultural use is determined by the relation of the\r\nquantity of available water to the quantity of available land. There is\r\na certain amount of water needed by a unit of land, and wherever the\r\nland susceptible of cultivation requires more water than is obtainable,\r\nonly a portion of the land can be utilized. But there is also a limit\r\nto the amount of water that can be profitably employed on a unit of\r\nland, and where the supply of water is in excess of the quantity\r\nrequired by such lands as are properly disposed to receive and use it,\r\nonly a portion of the water can be utilized. In order to ascertain,\r\ntherefore, the extent of agricultural land in a given district, it is\r\nnecessary to make a measurement of land, or a measurement of water, or\r\nperhaps both, and it is necessary to know the amount of water demanded\r\nby a unit area of the land under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe proper quota of water for irrigation depends on climate and\r\nsoil and subsoil, as well as on the nature of the crop, and varies\r\nindefinitely under diverse conditions. As a rule, the best soils\r\nrequire least water; those which demand most are light sands on one\r\nhand and adhesive clays on the other. Where the subsoil is open and\r\ndry, more water is needed than where it is moist or impervious.\r\nWherever there is an impervious substratum, the subsoil accumulates\r\nmoisture and the demand for water diminishes from year to year. These\r\nand other considerations so complicate the subject that it is difficult\r\nto generalize, and I have found it more practicable to use in my\r\ninvestigations certain limiting quantities than to attempt in every\r\ncase a diagnosis of the local conditions. By comparing the volumes\r\nof certain streams in Utah, that are now used in irrigation to their\r\nfull capacity, with the quantities of land that they serve, I have\r\nfound that one hundred acres of dry bench land (_i. e._, land with\r\na deep, dry, open subsoil) will not yield a full crop of grain with\r\nless than one cubic foot of water per second, and this under the most\r\nfavorable climate of the Territory. Where the climate is drier, a\r\ngreater quantity is required. Where there is a moist subsoil, a less\r\nmay suffice.\r\n\r\nIn the drier districts, where the streams are small, they are usually\r\nemployed upon the dry benches, because these are most convenient to\r\ntheir sources; and it is very rarely the case that their utility is\r\nincreased by the presence of a moist subsoil. But it is also in the\r\ndrier districts that the extent of agricultural land is ascertained by\r\nthe measurement of streams; and hence there is little danger of error\r\nif we use in all cases the criterion that applies to dry bench land. In\r\nthe discussion of the lands of northern Utah, I have therefore assigned\r\nto each cubic foot per second of perennial flow the reclamation of one\r\nhundred acres of land, with the belief that the consequent estimates\r\nwould never underrate, though they might sometimes exaggerate, the\r\nagricultural resources of the districts examined.\r\n\r\nIn the measurement of streams the following method was employed: A\r\nplace was sought where the channel was straight for a distance equal\r\nto several times the width of the stream, and where for some distance\r\nthere was little change in the dimensions of the cross section.\r\nMeasurement was then made of the width (in feet), of the mean depth (in\r\nfeet), and of the maximum surface current (in feet per second). The\r\nmean current was assumed to be four-fifths of the maximum current; and\r\nfour-fifths of the product of the three measured elements was taken to\r\ngive the flow in cubic feet per second. This method of measurement is\r\nconfessedly crude, and is liable to considerable error, but with the\r\ntime at my disposal no better was practicable, and its shortcomings\r\nare less to be regretted on account of the variability of the streams\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAll of the streams of Utah that flow from mountain slopes are subject\r\nto great fluctuations. They derive a large share of their water from\r\nthe melting of snow, and not only does the melting vary as to its\r\nrapidity and season, but the quantity of snow to be melted varies\r\ngreatly from year to year. A single measurement standing alone is quite\r\ninadequate to determine the capacity of a stream for irrigation, and as\r\nit was rarely practicable to visit a stream more than once, an endeavor\r\nwas made to supplement the single determination by collating the\r\njudgments of residents as to the relative flow of the several creeks\r\nand rivers at other seasons and in other years. In districts where\r\nthe water is nearly all used and its division and distribution are\r\nsupervised by “watermasters”, those functionaries are able to afford\r\ninformation of a tolerably definite character, but in other districts\r\nit was necessary to make great allowance for errors of judgment.\r\nCertainly, that element of my estimates which is based on inquiries\r\ncannot claim so small a probability of error as the element based on\r\nmeasurements.\r\n\r\nStreams that are formed in high mountains reach their highest stage\r\nin June, and their lowest in September or October. Streams from low\r\nmountains attain their maxima in April or May, and reach their low\r\nstages by August or September. In the low valleys the irrigation\r\nof wheat and other small grains begins about the first of June, and\r\ncontinues until the latter part of July. The irrigation of corn and\r\npotatoes begins in the early part of July, and continues until the\r\nmiddle of August. In the middle of July all of the land calls for\r\nwater, and if the supply is sufficient at that time, it is sure to\r\nmeet all demands at other times. It will be convenient to call that\r\ntime _the critical season_. In the higher agricultural valleys corn\r\nand potatoes are not grown, but the irrigation of small grains and hay\r\nis carried on from the middle of June to the middle or latter part of\r\nAugust. Through all this time the volume of the streams is diminishing,\r\nand if they fail at all it is at the end of the season. The critical\r\nseason for the higher valleys is about the middle of August.\r\n\r\nIn order to estimate properly the agricultural capability of a stream,\r\nit is necessary to ascertain its volume at its critical season. In the\r\ninvestigations of the past summer, this was accomplished by direct\r\nmeasurement in but a limited district. For the remainder of my field of\r\noperations I was compelled to depend on the estimates of others as to\r\nthe relation between the volumes of streams at the time of measurement\r\nand at the critical season.\r\n\r\nAs will appear in the sequel, the uncertainty attaching to these\r\ndeterminations of volumes affects the grand total in but small degree.\r\nThe utility of the large streams is not limited by their volumes\r\nso much as by the available land suitable for overflow, a quantity\r\nsusceptible of more accurate determination, and the extent of land\r\nirrigable by the large streams is many times greater than that\r\nirrigable by the small.\r\n\r\nNo streams are used throughout the year, and few can be fully utilized\r\nduring the spring flood. Wherever it is practicable to store up\r\nthe surplus water until the time of need, the irrigable area is\r\ncorrespondingly increased. Enough has been accomplished in a few\r\nlocalities to demonstrate the feasibility of reclaiming thousands of\r\nacres by the aid of reservoirs, and eventually this will be done; but\r\nexcept in a small way it is not a work of the immediate future. For\r\nmany years to come capital will find greater remuneration in taking\r\npossession of the large rivers.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the agricultural resources, it was, of course, necessary\r\nto take account of all future increase, and wherever storage by\r\nreservoirs seemed practicable a rough estimate was made of the extent\r\nof land that could be thus reclaimed.\r\n\r\nThere are a few restricted areas in Utah that yield remunerative crops\r\nto the farmer without the artificial application of water. Their\r\nproductiveness is doubled or trebled by the use of water, and so far as\r\nthey are susceptible of irrigation they need not be distinguished from\r\nthe irrigable lands. When the greater rivers shall have been diverted\r\nto the work of irrigation, nearly all such areas will be supplied with\r\nwater, but a few will not. The endeavor has been to include the latter\r\nas well as the former in the estimate of the agricultural land.\r\n\r\nThe term “agricultural land” is construed to include that which is used\r\nor may be used for the production of hay as well as that cultivated by\r\nthe plow. Most irrigable lands may be utilized in either way, but there\r\nare some tracts which, on account of the severity of the climate or the\r\nimpurity of the water, are adapted to the growth of grass only.\r\n\r\nI have sought in the foregoing remarks to set forth as briefly as\r\npossible the methods and scope of my investigations, and to indicate\r\nthe degree of accuracy to be anticipated in the resulting estimates. To\r\nthese estimates we will now proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   IRRIGATION BY THE LARGE STREAMS.\r\n\r\nThree rivers enter Great Salt Lake--the Bear, the Weber, and the\r\nJordan, and upon their water will ultimately depend the major part of\r\nthe agriculture of Utah. By a curious coincidence, the principal heads\r\nof the three rivers lie close together in the western end of the Uinta\r\nrange of mountains.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Bear River_ runs northward at first, and a little beyond the\r\nfoot of the mountains enters the Territory of Wyoming. Swerving to\r\nthe left, it passes again into Utah, and swerving again to the right\r\nreturns to Wyoming. From Wyoming it runs northward into Idaho, and\r\nafter making a great detour to the north returns on a more westerly\r\nline to Utah. It reënters in Cache Valley, and passes thence by a\r\nshort cañon to its delta plain on the northwestern border of Great\r\nSalt Lake. Its principal tributaries are received in Idaho and in\r\nCache Valley. Bordering upon the upper reaches of the river, there\r\nis little land available for cultivation, and the climate forbids\r\nany crop but hay. I am informed that the meadow land there somewhat\r\nexceeds two square miles in area. Where the river next enters Utah it\r\nruns for 30 miles through an open valley, the valley that contains the\r\ntowns of Woodruff and Randolph. At the head it passes through a short\r\ndefile, and can readily be thrown into two canals at such a level as\r\nto command the greater part of the valley, bringing about 90 square\r\nmiles of land “under ditch”. For the irrigation of this amount the\r\nriver is sufficient, but if the necessary water were thus appropriated,\r\ntoo little would remain for the use of the lands which border the\r\ncontiguous portions of the river in Wyoming. These have equal claim\r\nto the use of the river, and a proper distribution of the water would\r\nassign it to the reclamation of the best selection of land in the two\r\nTerritories. I estimate that such an adjustment would permit the Utah\r\nvalley to irrigate 45 square miles with the water of the river. The\r\nminor streams of the valley will serve, in addition, 24 square miles.\r\nThe climate is unfavorable to grain and the chief crop must be of hay.\r\n\r\nWhere the river next enters Utah it has acquired so great a volume that\r\nit is impracticable to make use of its entire amount. The portion of\r\nCache Valley which lies in Utah can nearly all be irrigated. What is\r\non the left bank of Bear River can be served by Logan River and other\r\ntributaries without calling on the main stream. The right bank will\r\nhave to be served in connection with an adjacent tract in Idaho, and by\r\na canal lying entirely in that Territory. The expense will be great,\r\nbut not greater than the benefit will warrant. I estimate that the Utah\r\ndivision of Cache Valley will ultimately contain 250 square miles of\r\nirrigated land. The climate admits of the growth of wheat, oats, and\r\ncorn, and such fruits as the apple, pear, and the apricot.\r\n\r\nIn leaving Cache Valley the river tumbles through a short, narrow\r\ncañon, and then enters the plain that borders the lake. The limestone\r\nwalls of the cañon offer a secure foundation for the head works to a\r\nsystem of canals to supply the plain. Here, again, a large outlay is\r\nnecessary, but the benefits will be more than commensurate. Not only\r\nwill the entire alluvial plain of the Bear be served, but the valley of\r\nthe Malade, as far as Oregon Springs, and the valley which extends from\r\nLittle Mountain to Connor’s Spring. After deducting from these areas\r\nthe land along the margin of the lake that is too saline to afford hope\r\nof reclamation, there remains a tract of 214 square miles. One-tenth of\r\nthis is now in use, being in part watered by Box Elder Creek and other\r\nsmall creeks, and in part cultivated without irrigation.\r\n\r\nIn the following table are summed the agricultural resources of that\r\nportion of the Bear River drainage basin which lies in Utah:\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------+--------------------------+\r\n  |                                    |     Square miles--       |\r\n  |               Tracts.              +-------------+------------+\r\n  |                                    |  Cultivated | Cultivable.|\r\n  |                                    |   in 1877.  |            |\r\n  +------------------------------------+-------------+------------+\r\n  |Base of Uinta Mountains             |       1.6   |       2.5  |\r\n  |Yellow Creek and Duck Creek         |       0.0   |       2.0  |\r\n  |Randolph Valley and Saleratus Creek |       9.6   |      69.0  |\r\n  |Shores of Bear Lake                 |       5.0   |       9.0  |\r\n  |Cache Valley                        |      50.0   |     250.0  |\r\n  |Delta Plain, Malade Valley,         |             |            |\r\n  |  and Connor’s Spring Valley        |      22.0   |     218.0  |\r\n  |Box Elder Valley (Mantua)           |       1.1   |       1.5  |\r\n  |                                    |-------------+------------|\r\n  |        Total                       |      89.3   |     552.0  |\r\n  +------------------------------------+-------------+------------+\r\n\r\nThe entire area of the Bear River District is about 3,620 square miles,\r\n2¹⁄₂ per cent. being now under cultivation, and over 15 per cent.\r\nsusceptible of cultivation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Weber River_ runs with a general northwesterly course from the\r\nUinta Mountains to Great Salt Lake, entering the latter at the middle\r\nof its eastern shore. The Ogden is its only important tributary. At\r\nthe foot of the mountains it enters Kamas Prairie, in which it can be\r\nmade to irrigate a few square miles. Thence to Hennefer, a distance\r\nof 30 miles, it is continuously bordered by a strip of farming land\r\nabout one-third of a mile broad. Then it passes a series of three\r\nclose cañons--in the intervals of which are Round Valley, with a few\r\nacres of land, and Morgan Valley, with 7 square miles--and emerges\r\nupon its delta plain. Within this plain are no less than 219 square\r\nmiles of farming land, of which about two-fifths are now in use. A part\r\nis unwatered, a part is watered by the Ogden River and by a number\r\nof creeks, and the remainder is watered by the Weber. To serve the\r\nhigher portions of the plain a great outlay would be required, and I\r\nam of opinion that the highest levels cannot profitably be supplied.\r\nStill, a great extension of the irrigated area is inevitable, and I\r\nanticipate that when the water of the Weber has been carried as far as\r\nis economically practicable, not more than 15 miles of the plain will\r\nremain unsupplied. Deducting this amount, as well as the area served\r\nby the minor streams and springs of the plain, there remain 185 square\r\nmiles dependent on the Weber and Ogden Rivers. The Ogden River has also\r\nto water 8 square miles in its upper course, and the Weber 34, making\r\na total of 227 square miles dependent on the two streams. Whether they\r\nare competent to serve so great an area may well be questioned. On the\r\n8th of October I found in the Ogden River, at the mouth of its cañon, a\r\nflow of 115 feet per second, and three days later the Weber showed 386\r\nfeet. There was almost no irrigation in progress at that time, and the\r\ntotal of 501 feet included practically all the water of the streams. To\r\nirrigate 227 square miles, the rivers need to furnish at the critical\r\nseason (in this case about the 10th of July) 1,450 feet, or nearly\r\nthree times their October volume. Of the ratio between their July and\r\nOctober volumes I have no direct means of judging, and the problem is\r\ntoo nice a one to be trusted to the estimates of residents unaided\r\nby measurements; but indirectly a partial judgment may be reached by\r\ncomparing the rivers with certain tributaries of the Jordan which were\r\ntwice observed. City Creek was measured on the 5th of July, and again\r\non 1st of September, and Emigration and Parley creeks were measured\r\nJuly 5th, and again September 3rd. These streams rise in mountains that\r\nare about as high as those which furnish the Weber and its branches,\r\nand their conditions are generally parallel. Their measured volumes\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n  +------------------------+--------------------------------+\r\n  |                        | I.--July volume, in            |\r\n  |                        |   feet per second.             |\r\n  |                        |      +-------------------------+\r\n  |                        |      | II.--September volume,  |\r\n  |   Streams.             |      |    in feet per          |\r\n  |                        |      |    second.              |\r\n  |                        |      |    +--------------------+\r\n  |                        |      |    | III.--Ratio of I to|\r\n  |                        |      |    |     II.            |\r\n  +------------------------+------+----+--------------------+\r\n  | City Creek             |  119 | 32 |        3.7         |\r\n  | Emigration Creek       |   24 |  8 |        3.0         |\r\n  | Parley’s Creek         |   72 | 29 |        2.5         |\r\n  +------------------------+------+----+--------------------+\r\n\r\nThe comparison is not decisive, but it seems to show that the problem\r\ndemands for its solution a careful examination at the “critical\r\nseason.” If the Ogden and Weber had been measured in September, as\r\nwere the other streams, their volumes would probably have been found\r\nless than in October; and this consideration appears to throw the\r\nbalance of evidence against the competence of the rivers to water the\r\ncontiguous lands.\r\n\r\nBut if their incompetence shall be proved, it does not follow that the\r\nlands must go dry. The Bear at the north and the Jordan at the south\r\nhave each a great volume of surplus water, and either supply can be led\r\nwithout serious engineering difficulty to the lower levels of the delta\r\nof the Weber.\r\n\r\nIn the following table are summed the agricultural resources of the\r\nWeber drainage basin:\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------+--------------------------+\r\n  |                              |      Square miles--      |\r\n  |           Tracts.            +------------+-------------+\r\n  |                              | Cultivated | Cultivable. |\r\n  |                              |   in 1877. |             |\r\n  +------------------------------+------------+-------------+\r\n  |Kamas Prairie (northern edge) |      .7    |     3.0     |\r\n  |Peoa to Hennefer, inclusive   |     8.5    |     9.0     |\r\n  |Parley’s Park                 |     3.2    |     3.2     |\r\n  |Uptown                        |      .5    |     2.0     |\r\n  |Echo Creek                    |      .3    |      .9     |\r\n  |Croydon                       |      .4    |      .5     |\r\n  |Round Valley                  |      .5    |      .5     |\r\n  |Morgan Valley                 |     6.0    |     6.9     |\r\n  |Ogden Valley                  |     4.1    |     8.0     |\r\n  |Delta Plain                   |    91.0    |   219.0     |\r\n  |                              +------------+-------------+\r\n  |      Total                   |   115.2    |   253.0     |\r\n  +------------------------------+------------+-------------+\r\n\r\nThe estimate of 219 miles of cultivable land on the Delta Plain\r\nincludes 15 miles that will probably never be irrigated, but may\r\nnevertheless be farmed.\r\n\r\nThe total area of the Weber basin (including the whole plain from\r\nBonneville to Centerville, and excluding the main body of Kamas\r\nPrairie) is 2,450 square miles; 4³⁄₄ per cent. of the area is now under\r\ncultivation, and 10¹⁄₃ per cent. is susceptible of cultivation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Jordan River_ is the outlet of Utah Lake, and runs northward,\r\nentering Great Salt Lake at its southeastern angle. On the right it\r\nreceives a number of large tributaries from the Wasatch Range. The\r\nlargest tributary of Utah Lake is the Provo River, which rises in the\r\nUinta Mountains close to the heads of the Weber and Bear.\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of its mountain cañon the Provo enters Kamas Prairie,\r\nand it hugs the south margin of the plain just as the Weber hugs the\r\nnorth margin, passing out by a narrow defile at the southwest corner.\r\nAt one time in the history of the prairie the Provo flowed northward\r\nthrough it and joined itself to the Weber. The surface of the prairie\r\nwas then lower than now, and the sand and gravel which the river\r\nbrought from the mountains accumulated upon it. Eventually the Provo\r\nbuilt its alluvium so high that its water found a new passage over the\r\nwall of the valley. The new channel, affording a more rapid descent\r\nthan the old, quickened the current through the valley, and caused\r\nit to reverse its action and begin the excavation of the material it\r\nhad deposited. So long as the river built up its bed, its channel was\r\ninconstant, shifting from place to place over the whole plain; but so\r\nsoon as it began to cut away the bed, its position became fixed and\r\nthe plain was abandoned. The river now flows in a narrow valley of its\r\nown making, 150 feet below the surface of the plain. As a result of\r\nthis mode of origin, Kamas Prairie slopes uniformly from the Provo to\r\nthe Weber, and it would be an immense undertaking to irrigate it with\r\nthe water of the Weber. But the Provo River can be returned to its\r\nancient duty with comparative ease. A few miles of canal will suffice\r\nto carry its water to the upper edge of the plain, and thence it can\r\nbe led to every part. Already a small canal has been constructed and\r\nits enlargement may convert the whole prairie into a meadow. Thus the\r\nprairie, although part of the drainage basin of the Weber, belongs to\r\nthe irrigation district of the Provo.\r\n\r\nThe Provo next follows a narrow rock bound valley for 7 miles, being\r\nskirted by bottom lands that admit of some farming. It then enters\r\nProvo Valley, an opening about as large as the last, and favored by a\r\nwarm climate that permits the growth of breadstuffs. Thence to Utah\r\nValley it follows a deep, close cañon.\r\n\r\nThe volume of the Provo is sufficient to water about 100 square miles.\r\nIf it be permitted to serve 28 miles in Kamas Prairie and 40 miles in\r\nProvo Valley and its adjuncts, there will remain for Utah Valley the\r\nquota for 32 miles. The minor streams of the valley, American Fork,\r\nSpanish Fork, Hobble Creek, Payson Creek, etc., will irrigate 120\r\nmiles, making a total of 152 square miles supplied with water. The\r\ntotal land of the valley which might be irrigated if the water were\r\nsufficient amounts to no less than 225 miles.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that if all available lands on the upper Provo are\r\nreclaimed, one-third of Utah Valley must go unwatered, while if none of\r\nthem are irrigated, nearly the whole of the valley will be supplied. A\r\nmiddle course would appear most wise, and will undoubtedly be followed.\r\nA gradual extension of the canals, as the demands and means of the\r\ncommunities dictate and permit, will bring lands successively into\r\nuse in the order of their value and convenience, and when the limit\r\nis reached and title has been acquired to all the water, the most\r\navailable lands in each of the three valleys traversed by the Provo\r\nwill have been reclaimed. The residents of Kamas Prairie will probably\r\nhave increased their meadows so as to furnish winter hay for herds\r\nsufficient to stock the summer pastures of the vicinity; Provo Valley,\r\nhaving a less favorable climate than Utah Valley, will have irrigated\r\nonly its choicest soils; and the major part of the river will belong\r\nto Utah Valley. The apportionment may be roughly estimated as--Kamas\r\nPrairie, 10 miles; Provo Valley and Waldsburg, 20 miles, and Utah\r\nValley, 70 miles.\r\n\r\nBelow Utah Lake there is little inequality of volume dependent on\r\nseason. The lake is a natural reservoir 127 square miles in extent,\r\nand so far equalizes the outflow through the Jordan that the volume of\r\nthat stream is less affected by the mean level of the lake than by the\r\ninfluence of northerly and southerly winds. With suitable head works\r\nits volume can be completely controlled, and, if desirable, the entire\r\ndischarge of the lake can be concentrated in the season of irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe highest stage of the lake is in July, and the lowest in March\r\nor April; and the natural volume of its outlet has of course a\r\ncorresponding change. In July I found that volume to be 1,275 feet per\r\nsecond, and I am informed by residents that the stream carried more\r\nthan one-half as much water in its low stage; 1,000 feet is perhaps not\r\nfar from the mean volume. When all possible use is made of Provo River\r\nand other tributaries the annual inflow of the lake will be diminished\r\nby about one-eighth, and the outflow by a greater fraction, which we\r\nwill assume to be one-quarter. (This postulates that the evaporation\r\nis at the rate of 90 inches per year for the whole lake surface.) The\r\nremaining perennial outflow of 750 feet per second, if concentrated\r\ninto four months, would irrigate for that period 350 square miles. It\r\nwill be practicable to include under canals from the Jordan only about\r\n160 square miles of farming land, and I think it safe to assume that\r\nthe supply of water will be greatly in excess of the demand.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the Jordan is little used, the chief irrigation of\r\nSalt Lake Valley being performed by the large creeks that flow from\r\nthe mountains at the east. It will not be long, however, before large\r\ncanals are constructed to carry the Jordan water to all parts of the\r\nvalley that lie below the level of Utah Lake. They will include 120\r\nsquare miles of farming land.\r\n\r\nThe mountain streams, being no longer needed in the lower parts of the\r\nvalley, will be carried to higher land and made to serve the benches\r\nat the base of the mountains. By these means the total agricultural\r\narea of the valley will be increased to 192 square miles. Eventually,\r\nthe western canal will be carried about the north end of the Oquirrh\r\nrange and made to irrigate the northern third of Tooele Valley. It will\r\npass above the farming lands of E. T. City and Grantsville, and enable\r\nthe streams which irrigate the latter town to be used upon the higher\r\nslopes. The service of the Jordan will amount to no less than 40 miles\r\nand the agricultural area of the valley will be increased to about 45\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\nIncluding Tooele Valley and Kamas Prairie with the drainage basin of\r\nthe Jordan, its agricultural resources sum up as follows:\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------+--------------------------+\r\n  |                                       |      Square miles--      |\r\n  |           Tracts.                     +------------+-------------+\r\n  |                                       | Cultivated | Cultivable. |\r\n  |                                       |   in 1877. |             |\r\n  +---------------------------------------+------------+-------------+\r\n  |Kamas Prairie                          |     4.0    |     10.0    |\r\n  |Hailstone Ranche and vicinity          |     2.0    |      2.0    |\r\n  |Provo Valley                           |     6.0    |     16.0    |\r\n  |Waldsburg                              |     2.0    |      2.0    |\r\n  |Utah Valley                            |    59.0    |    190.0    |\r\n  |Goshen }                               |            |             |\r\n  |Mona   } Salt Creek                    |    14.0    |     16.0    |\r\n  |Nephi  }                               |            |             |\r\n  |Salt Lake Valley                       |            |             |\r\n  | (including Bountiful and Centerville) |    89.8    |    192.0    |\r\n  |Tooele Valley                          |     5.4    |     45.0    |\r\n  |                                       +------------+-------------+\r\n  |      Total                            |   182.2    |    473.0    |\r\n  +---------------------------------------+------------+-------------+\r\n\r\nThe drainage district has an area of 4,010 miles; 4¹⁄₂ per cent. are\r\ncultivated, and 11³⁄₄ per cent. may be cultivated.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in these estimates the available water\r\nabove Utah Lake is regarded as insufficient for the available land,\r\nwhile below the lake there is a superabundance of water, and yet\r\nthe lower stream is only a continuation of the upper streams. The\r\ndifference arises from the function of the lake as a reservoir. Below\r\nthe reservoir the whole of the annual supply can be controlled, but\r\nabove it I have assumed that irrigation will merely make use for the\r\nirrigating season of the quantity which flows at the critical period.\r\nIf artificial reservoirs can be constructed so as to store water for\r\nuse in Utah Valley, a greater area can be cultivated. With adequate\r\nstorage facilities the streams tributary to the lake can irrigate in\r\nKamas Prairie 28 miles; in Provo Valley and vicinity 40 miles; in\r\nThistle Valley 6 miles; on Salt Creek 16 miles, and in Utah Valley 225\r\nmiles, making a total of 315 miles; and there will still escape to the\r\nJordan enough water to serve all the land assigned to that stream. If\r\nsuch storage is practicable, the estimate tabulated above should show\r\n552 instead of 473 miles of cultivable land. The region most likely to\r\nafford storage facilities lies in the mountains where the waters rise.\r\nI did not visit it, and until it has been examined I shall not venture\r\nto increase the estimate.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives a summary for the Great Salt Lake river\r\nsystem:\r\n\r\n +---------------+-----------------------------------------------------+\r\n |               |                       Areas, in square miles.       |\r\n |               +-----------+-------------+--------------+------------+\r\n |  Districts.   |   Whole   |   Under     |   To be      |    Total   |\r\n |               | district. | cultivation | reclaimed in | cultivable.|\r\n |               |           |  in 1877.   | the future.  |            |\r\n +---------------+-----------+-------------+--------------+------------+\r\n |  Bear River   |  3,620    |    89.3     |    462.7     |   552.0    |\r\n |  Weber River  |  2,450    |   115.2     |    137.8     |   253.0    |\r\n |  Jordan River |  4,010    |   192.2     |    280.8     |   473.0    |\r\n |               +-----------+-------------+--------------+------------+\r\n |     Total     | 10,080    |   396.7     |    881.3     | 1,278.0    |\r\n |               +-----------+-------------+--------------+------------+\r\n |     Ratios    |  1,000    |     .039    |     .088     |    .127    |\r\n +---------------+-----------+-------------+--------------+------------+\r\n\r\nThis region includes an eighth part of the land area of the Territory,\r\nand more than one-half the agricultural land.

The\r\ncost of the canals by which its cultivated lands have been furnished\r\nwith water has been about $2,000,000. To complete its system of\r\nirrigation will probably cost $5,000,000 more.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     IRRIGATION BY SMALL STREAMS.\r\n\r\nThrough the remainder of the drainage basin of Great Salt Lake there\r\nare no large bodies of farming land. At wide intervals are small\r\ntracts, dependent on springs and small creeks, and the available land\r\nis in nearly every case greatly in excess of the available water. A\r\nfew exceptional spots are cultivated without irrigation, but so far as\r\nthey have been discovered they are so situated as to be moistened from\r\nbeneath.

An atmosphere endowed with but a\r\nsmall share of moisture precipitates freely only when it is reduced\r\nto a low temperature. Agriculture is dependent on the precipitation\r\nof moisture, but cannot endure the associated cold climate. It can\r\nflourish only where mountain masses turn over the aqueous product of\r\ntheir cold climates to low valleys endowed with genial climates. The\r\nWasatch and Uinta crests stand from 6,000 to 9,000 feet higher than the\r\nvalleys bordering Great Salt Lake. Their climate has a temperature from\r\n20° to 30° lower. The snows that accumulate upon them in winter are not\r\nmelted by the first warmth of spring, but yield slowly to the advancing\r\nsun, and all through the season of growing crops feed the streams\r\nthat water the valleys. The Bear, the Weber, and the Jordan carry the\r\nmoisture of the mountains to the warmth of the valleys, and fertility\r\nis the result.\r\n\r\nTo the north and west of the lake there are many mountains, but they\r\nare too low and small to store up snow banks until the time of need.\r\nTheir streams are spent before the summer comes; and only a few springs\r\nare perennial. The result is a general desert, dotted by a few oases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n          IRRIGABLE LANDS OF THE VALLEY OF THE SEVIER RIVER.\r\n\r\n                       BY CAPTAIN C. E. DUTTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an agricultural region, the valley of the Sevier River and of\r\nits tributaries is one of the most important in Utah. The amount of\r\narable land which may be reached by the waters of the stream is very\r\nmuch larger than the stream can water advantageously, and the time is\r\nprobably not far distant when all the water that can be obtained will\r\nbe utilized in producing cereals, and there is probably no other region\r\nin Utah where the various problems relating to the most economic use\r\nof water will be solved so speedily. It is, therefore, a region of\r\nunusual interest, regarded in the light of the new industrial problems\r\nwhich the irrigation of these western lands is now bringing forward.\r\nFortunately, there is a smaller prospect of difficulty and obstruction\r\nin the settlement of the legal controversies which must inevitably\r\narise elsewhere out of disputes about water rights than will be\r\nencountered in other regions, for the Mormon Church is an institution\r\nwhich quietly, yet resistlessly, assumes the power to settle such\r\ndisputes, and the Mormon people in these outlying settlements yield to\r\nits assumptions an unhesitating obedience. Whatever the church deems\r\nbest for the general welfare of its dependencies it dictates, and\r\nwhat it dictates is invariably done with promptitude, and none have\r\nyet been found to resist. This communal arrangement has been attended\r\nwith great success so far as the development of the water resources\r\nare concerned, and the system of management has ordinarily been so\r\nconducted that the general welfare has been immensely benefited; and\r\nif individuals have suffered, it has not been made manifest by any\r\napparent symptoms of general discontent or of individual resistance.\r\nThe system is by no means perfect as yet, but its imperfections may be\r\nfound in details which produce no present serious inconvenience, and\r\nthey will no doubt be remedied as rapidly as they attain the magnitude\r\nof great evils.\r\n\r\nThe Sevier River has its course along the southeastern border of the\r\nGreat Basin of the west, and its upper streams head in the lofty divide\r\nwhich separates the drainage system of the Colorado River on the south\r\nand east from the drainage system of the Great Basin on the north and\r\nwest. The general course of the upper portion of the stream is from\r\nsouth to north, though its tributaries flow in many directions. The\r\nlower portion of the stream, within 60 miles of its end, suddenly\r\nbreaks through one of the Basin Ranges on the west--the Pavant--and\r\nthen turns southwestward and empties into Sevier Lake, one of the\r\nsalinas of the Great Basin.\r\n\r\nThe main valley of the Sevier River has a N. S. trend, and begins on\r\nthe divide referred to, about 270 miles almost due south of Great\r\nSalt Lake, and continues northward a distance of about 170 miles.\r\nThere are three principal forks of this stream. The lowest fork is\r\nat Gunnison, 140 miles south of Salt Lake City, and called the San\r\nPete, which waters a fine valley about 45 miles in length, and which\r\nis at present the most important agricultural district in Utah. About\r\n80 miles farther up the stream, at Circle Valley, the river divides\r\ninto two very nearly equal branches; one coming from the south, the\r\nother breaking through a great plateau on the east. These are called,\r\nrespectively, the South and East Fork of the Sevier. The South Fork has\r\nits principal fountains far up on the surface of a great plateau--the\r\nPanguitch Plateau--whose broad expanse it drains by three considerable\r\nstreams, which finally unite in the valley at the foot of its eastern\r\nslope.\r\n\r\nThe East Fork of the Sevier receives the waters of a beautiful valley\r\nlying to the eastward of and parallel to the main valley of the Sevier,\r\nand separated from it by a lofty plateau 90 miles in length from north\r\nto south, and from 10 to 20 miles in breadth, called the Sevier\r\nPlateau. Through this great barrier the stream has cut a wide gorge\r\n4,000 feet in depth and 10 miles long, called East Fork Cañon, and\r\nright at its lower end it joins the South Fork of the Sevier.\r\n\r\nThe physical geography of the region drained by the waters of the\r\nriver is highly interesting, and has an important relation to the\r\nsubject. The area in question consists of a series of tabular blocks,\r\nof vast proportions, cut out of the general platform of the country\r\nby great faults, and lifted above it from 2,000 to nearly 6,000 feet,\r\nso that the absolute altitudes (above sea level) of the tables range\r\nfrom 9,000 to 11,500 feet. Where the valleys are lowest the tables are\r\nhighest, and _vice versa_. The valleys or lowlands stand from 5,000\r\nto 7,500 feet above the sea. The plateaus have areas ranging from 400\r\nto 1,800 square miles, and collectively with the included lowlands\r\nwithin the drainage system of the Sevier have an area of about 5,400\r\nsquare miles. The tables front the valleys with barriers which are\r\nmore continuous and which more closely resemble long lines of cliffs\r\nthan the mountain chains and sierras of other portions of the Rocky\r\nMountain Region, and there are stretches of unbroken walls, crowned\r\nwith vast precipices, 10, 20, and even 40 miles in length, which look\r\ndown from snowy altitudes upon the broad and almost torrid expanses\r\nbelow. If the palisades of the Hudson had ten times their present\r\naltitude and five or six times their present length, and if they had\r\nbeen battered, notched, and crumbled by an unequal erosion, they would\r\noffer much the same appearance as that presented by the wall of the\r\nSevier Plateau which fronts the main valley of the Sevier. If they\r\nwere from six to eight times multiplied, and extended from Hoboken\r\nto West Point, and were similarly shattered, they would present the\r\nappearance of the eastern wall of Grass Valley. If they were eight to\r\nten times multiplied, and imagined to extend around three-fourths of\r\nthe periphery of an area 40 miles by 20, and but little damaged by\r\nerosion, they would represent the solemn battlements of the Aquarius\r\nPlateau. These great plateaus are masses of volcanic rock overlying\r\nsedimentaries, the latter so deeply buried that they are seldom seen\r\neven in the deepest chasms, while superposed floods of volcanic\r\noutflows are shown in sections, reaching sometimes a thickness of 5,000\r\nfeet. The dark colors of these rocks give a somber aspect to the\r\nscenery, and the gloomy fronts of the towering precipices are rendered\r\npeculiarly grand and imposing.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing winds of this region are from the west, northwest,\r\nand southwest, and are a portion of the more general movement of the\r\natmospheric ocean which moves bodily from the Pacific to the heart\r\nof the continent. In crossing the Sierra Nevada a large portion of\r\nits moisture is wrung from the air, which blows hot and arid across\r\nthe Great Basin. Notwithstanding the aridity of the basin area, the\r\nair gains about as much moisture as it loses in crossing it, until it\r\nstrikes the great barriers on the east side of the basin--the Wasatch\r\nand the chain of high plateaus which are mapped as its southerly\r\ncontinuation. Here the winds are projected by the bold fronts several\r\nthousands of feet upward. The consequent cooling and rarefaction\r\ncondense from them an amount of moisture which, relatively to that\r\narid country, may be called large, though far less than that of more\r\nfavored regions. In the valleys the rainfall is exceedingly small;\r\nalmost the whole of the precipitation is in the high altitudes. It\r\nis no uncommon thing to see the heavy masses of the cumulus clouds\r\nenveloping the summits of all the plateaus while the valleys lie under\r\na sky but little obscured. The plateaus, then, are the reservoirs where\r\nthe waters accumulate, and from which they descend in many rivulets\r\nand rills, while around their bases are copious springs fed by the\r\nwaters which fall above. The rainfall in the valleys is very small, as\r\ncompared with that upon the plateaus, and it is also highly variable.\r\nNo record has been kept of the precipitation within the drainage\r\nsystem of the Sevier, and the nearest point where such a record has\r\nbeen kept is at Fort Cameron, near Beaver, at the western base of\r\nthe Tushar Mountains. These observations cover but a brief period,\r\nand no doubt represent a much larger precipitation than that which\r\noccurs in the valleys and plains generally, because the situation of\r\nthe point of observation is just at the base of the loftiest range in\r\nsouthern Utah, where the air currents from the west first strike it.\r\nMoreover, these observations are not yet published, and are not at\r\npresent available. In the narrow valleys between closely approximated\r\nand lofty mountain walls, like the valley of the Sevier at Marysvale,\r\nthe rainfall is greater than where the valley is wider, with lower\r\nwalls, as at Panguitch, Richfield, and Gunnison. An estimate of the\r\namount would be very hazardous; but, judging from what is known of\r\nsimilar localities, the amount in the wider valleys may be as low as\r\n7 or 8 inches, or as high as 10 or 11. In the narrower and deeper\r\nvalleys it may be between 10 and 12 inches. Upon the plateaus it may\r\nbe as large as 30 to 35 inches. The principal fall is in the winter\r\nand spring months, from the middle of November to the first of June;\r\nand in this period at least seven-eighths of the precipitation must be\r\naccomplished in the valleys and three-fourths upon the plateaus. There\r\nis, however, a large amount of variation in the distribution of the\r\nmonthly falls from year to year. No two consecutive years correspond\r\nin this respect. In 1876 a heavy storm, with great rainfall and snow,\r\noccurred in the month of October, but in 1875 and 1877 no such storm\r\noccurred. In 1875 many drenching showers occurred in the months of July\r\nand August, but none occurred at the same months of 1877. In general,\r\nhowever, no summer rainfall has ever been known of such extent as to\r\ndispense with the necessity of irrigation, or even to materially reduce\r\nthe necessary amount. Great variability in the distribution of the fall\r\nover different months of the year is one of the characteristics of the\r\nclimate. But whatever the distribution, it is never such as to affect\r\nthis one conspicuous feature--that the season in which crops must have\r\ntheir chief growth and reach their maturity is the dry season.\r\n\r\nConnected with the irrigation of the Sevier Valley is a limiting\r\ncondition, which rarely has to be considered in connection with the\r\nlands watered by the Bear and Weber Rivers, and which does not enter at\r\nall into the lands lying about Great Salt Lake. It is the dependence of\r\nclimate upon altitude. There are lands along the upper portions of the\r\nforks of the Sevier which can be irrigated easily enough, but which are\r\nnot cultivable for grain on account of the shortness of the summer and\r\nof the danger of frosts during the growth and ripening of the grain.\r\nThis in turn is directly connected with the altitude. At the point\r\nwhere the Sevier leaves its main valley and enters the Pavant range,\r\nits altitude is 5,050 feet above sea-level. At Gunnison it is 5,150\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe altitudes of the San Pete Valley are approximately as follows:\r\n\r\n                     Feet.\r\n  Manti              5,350\r\n  Ephraim            5,450\r\n  Moroni             5,500\r\n  Springtown         5,550\r\n  Mount Pleasant     5,600\r\n  Fairview           5,725\r\n  Fountain Green     5,650\r\n\r\nBeginning at Gunnison and ascending the Sevier along its main course,\r\nthe altitudes are as follows:\r\n\r\n                    Feet.\r\n  Gunnison          5,100\r\n  Salina            5,175\r\n  Richfield         5,300\r\n  Monroe            5,350\r\n  Joseph City       5,375\r\n  Marysvale         5,600\r\n  Circle Valley     6,000\r\n\r\nTaking the East Fork in Grass Valley:\r\n\r\n                              Feet.\r\n  Head of East Fork Cañon     6,300\r\n  Cousharem                   6,700\r\n  Daniels’ Ranch              7,000\r\n\r\nTaking the South Fork:\r\n\r\n                                 Feet.\r\n  Head of Panguitch Cañon        6,250\r\n  Panguitch                      6,400\r\n  Hillsdale                      6,550\r\n  Junction of Mammoth Creek      6,900\r\n\r\nIn the San Pete Valley, which has been cultivated as far up as Mount\r\nPleasant for twenty years, I cannot learn that any crop has ever been\r\ninjured by frosts, and we may therefore conclude that this valley is\r\nsafe from such an attack, unless a most abnormal one. The same may\r\nbe said of the main Sevier Valley from Joseph City downward. From\r\nJoseph City to Circle Valley there is a relatively small proportion\r\nof irrigable land, but such as there is may, I think, be regarded as\r\nsafe from frost. Circle Valley, where the two forks unite, has been\r\ncultivated for cereals for four years, and has not yet suffered from\r\nfrost, and it is fair to assume that such a calamity will be very\r\ninfrequent there, though it may not be possible to say there is no\r\ndanger. In Panguitch Valley, a severe frost in August, 1874, inflicted\r\ngreat injury upon the crops, and only a small quantity of very\r\ninferior grain was harvested. But in 1875, 1876, and 1877, excellent\r\ncrops were secured. Above Panguitch the amount of arable land is not\r\ngreat, and the danger to crops is increased. In Grass Valley there\r\nis a magnificent expanse of fertile arable land, but there can be no\r\nquestion that a large portion of it is so liable to killing frosts in\r\nAugust, or even in July, that the cereals cannot flourish there. The\r\nlower portion of the valley, near the head of East Fork Cañon, is more\r\nhopeful, and it is probable that a large majority of crops planted\r\nthere will mature, though occasional damage may be reasonably looked\r\nfor. The general result may be summarized as follows: Below 6,000 feet\r\ncrops may be considered as safe from serious damage by frosts. From\r\n6,000 to 7,000 feet crops are liable to damage in a degree proportional\r\nto the excess of altitude above 6,000 feet. Above 7,000 feet the danger\r\nis probably such as to render agriculture of little value to those who\r\nmay pursue it.\r\n\r\nThe climate has shown in past times a longer period of variation than\r\nthe annual one. Panguitch was settled once in 1860, but was abandoned\r\non account of the destruction of crops by the frosts. The settlement\r\nwas renewed in 1867, and again abandoned, in consequence of the attacks\r\nof Indians. It was settled a third time in 1870, and, though crops have\r\noccasionally been injured, the agriculture has on the whole proved\r\nremunerative.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at the irrigable lands of the Sevier and its\r\ntributaries. Above the town of Panguitch, on the South Fork, there is\r\na considerable area of arable land, which could be easily reached by\r\ncanals from the main stream and below 7,000 feet altitude, but for want\r\nof a detailed survey it is impossible to do more than guess at the\r\narea. I think, however, that 8,000 acres would be the maximum limit.\r\nThis portion of the valley is liable to killing frosts, though during\r\nthe last three years it has not suffered from this cause. In the long\r\nrun, I believe agriculture will not prove remunerative here. From\r\nPanguitch northward to the head of the Panguitch Cañon, a distance of\r\n18 miles, is a broad valley, averaging 5 miles in width, a very large\r\nportion of which is irrigable, provided the water supply is adequate.\r\nAt least 24,000 acres may be cultivated without resort to anything more\r\nthan the usual methods of distributing the water; but not the whole\r\nof this area is fertile. The greater part of the area of Panguitch\r\nValley is composed of alluvial slopes, or, as they have been termed\r\nby geologists, alluvial cones. Although these surface features are\r\npresented in a somewhat more typical and striking manner in Grass\r\nValley, yet they are well enough exhibited here; and as they have an\r\nimportant relation to the subject, I will briefly discuss them.\r\n\r\nIn a mountainous country like this, where the melting of the snows in\r\nspring or heavy rainfalls at other seasons create sudden and great\r\ntorrents, large quantities of detritus are carried down from the\r\nmountains into the valleys. These mountain streams, which in summer,\r\nautumn, and early winter are ordinarily either very small or wholly\r\ndried up, may upon certain occasions become devastating floods. The\r\nbottoms of the ravines are steep water courses, down which the angry\r\ntorrents rush with a power which is seldom comprehended by those who\r\ndwell in less rugged regions. Huge boulders weighing several tons,\r\ngreat trees, with smaller débris of rocks, gravel, sand, and clay,\r\nare swept along with resistless force, until the decreasing slope\r\ndiminishes the energy sufficiently to permit the greater boulders\r\nto come to rest, while the smaller ones are still swept onward. The\r\ndecrease of slope is continuous, so that smaller and smaller fragments\r\nreach a stable position, and only cobblestones, gravel, or sand reach\r\nthe junctions of the streams with the main rivers. Around the openings\r\nof the greater gorges and ravines the deposits of coarser detritus\r\nbuild up in the lapse of time the alluvial cones. As it accumulates,\r\neach torrent builds up its bed and constantly changes the position of\r\nits channel, and with the mouth of the ravine for a center it sweeps\r\naround from right to left and left to right like a radius, adding\r\ncontinually, year after year, to the accumulations of detritus. Thus a\r\nportion of a flat cone is formed, having its apex at the mouth of the\r\nravine. At the foot of mountain ranges these alluvial cones are formed\r\nat the mouth of every ravine, and are sometimes so near together that\r\nthey intersect each other, or become confluent. They are composed of\r\nrudely stratified materials, ranging in size or grain from fine silt\r\nand sand to rounded stones of several hundredweight, and occasionally\r\na block of a ton or more may be seen near the apex of the cone. In\r\nregions where the rocks are soft and readily disintegrated the stones\r\nare more worn, less in number, and smaller in size, and this is the\r\ncase generally with unaltered sedimentary rocks. But in valleys running\r\namong volcanic ranges, the much greater hardness and durability of the\r\nmaterials preserve them from disintegration, and the stones are more\r\nnumerous, larger, and less worn by attrition, composing indeed a very\r\nlarge proportion of the bulk of the alluvial cones. A large portion\r\nof the valley of the Sevier lies in the midst of a volcanic region,\r\nand its sides are everywhere flanked with these alluvial cones, which\r\nare very stony and gravelly. The lower portion of the Sevier is in a\r\ncountry made of sedimentary beds, and though the alluvial cones are\r\nequally common, they consist of finer material, and are less burdened\r\nwith stones.\r\n\r\nThe Panguitch Valley is between volcanic plateaus, and most of its area\r\nconsists of alluvial cone land, which is no doubt fertile wherever the\r\nstones and rubble are not sufficient to prevent plowing and planting,\r\nbut this difficulty must render it at least very undesirable. There\r\nis, however, a large area of land of another description in Panguitch\r\nValley, composed of the finest silt brought down by the gentler current\r\nof the river itself, and deposited within its own basin. This is good\r\nbottom land, and the amount of it I estimate at not less than 7,000\r\nacres. It has already been remarked that Panguitch Valley stands at\r\nan altitude above 6,000 feet, and is not free from danger of summer\r\nfrosts. These have been known to destroy or seriously injure the grain,\r\nthough in a majority of years crops will no doubt be safely harvested.\r\nWhether the danger is such as to make agriculture unremunerative in the\r\nlong run experience can alone demonstrate.\r\n\r\nFollowing the South Fork of the Sevier downward through the Panguitch\r\ncañons, the next important agricultural area is Circle Valley. This\r\nis a broad, nearly circular area, situated in the midst of scenery\r\nof the most magnificent description. Upon the east and west sides\r\nrise those gigantic cliffs which are the peculiar feature of the\r\nscenery of this elevated region, looking down upon the valley below\r\nfrom altitudes of 4,000 to 5,000 feet. This valley also has upon its\r\nsides long sloping areas of stony alluvial cones, full of blocks of\r\ntrachyte and basalt washed down from the cliffs above. It has also\r\na large area of arable land. There is in addition, a certain area\r\nof sandy land of an inferior degree of excellence. The area of best\r\nbottom land will probably reach as high as 6,000 acres. In this area\r\nthere is probably very little danger from early frosts, as the 6,000\r\nfeet contour passes through the middle of the valley, and, as already\r\nstated, the areas which lie within this limit are reasonably safe from\r\nthis occurrence. At the north end of Circle Valley we find the junction\r\nof the two main forks of the Sevier River. From the junction the main\r\nstream runs northward for nearly 20 miles, and throughout this entire\r\nstretch there is but little arable land. Upon both sides of the river\r\nthere are long alluvial slopes, made up of stony materials and coarse\r\ngravels, through which a plow could scarcely be driven. A portion of\r\nthe way the river runs between rocks and low cliffs and in abrupt\r\ncañons, cutting through old trachyte and basaltic outflows. Reaching\r\nMarysvale, we find a sufficient area for three or four good sized\r\nfarms, consisting of bottom land of the finest quality, which can be\r\nwatered either from the Sevier River itself or from two considerable\r\naffluents which come roaring down out of the Beaver Mountains. North of\r\nMarysvale is a barrier thrown across the valley, consisting of rugged\r\nhills of rhyolitic rocks, through which the river has cut a deep cañon;\r\nbut agriculture in any portion of this barrier is out of the question.\r\nThe river emerges from it at the head of what may be called its main\r\nor lower valley, near the Mormon settlement called Joseph City. From\r\nthis point northward we find what must undoubtedly become the great\r\nagricultural area of southern Utah. It is a magnificent valley, nowhere\r\nless than 5 miles in width, and at least 60 miles in length, with\r\nabrupt mountain walls on either side, and almost the whole of its soil\r\nconsisting of alluvial cones, and susceptible of a high degree of\r\ncultivation. The limit of the amount of land in this valley which can\r\nbe irrigated is measured by the quantity of water which can be found\r\nto turn upon it. The western side of the valley is flanked by abrupt\r\nwalls of sedimentary rocks. As I have before stated, the alluvial cones\r\nwhich find their origin in the degradation of these sedimentary walls\r\nare invariably composed of finer materials than those which come from\r\nthe breaking up of volcanic rocks. The soil, therefore, is much more\r\nreadily plowed and planted than the corresponding cones farther up the\r\nriver. The surface of these cones, moreover, is coated with a thick\r\nlayer of fine loam, and it is not until penetrated to a considerable\r\ndepth that we come upon a coarser material. This portion of the valley\r\nof the Sevier has been under cultivation for more than eight years.\r\nThe art of irrigation has also reached a certain stage of advancement,\r\nat which it can be studied with some interest. A canal of sufficient\r\nmagnitude to carry the entire body of the water of the Sevier during\r\nthe dry season has been run for a distance of 8 miles, and is used for\r\nirrigating the large grain fields which lie around Richfield; and, as\r\nirrigation is now conducted, the entire flow of the stream is turned\r\nthrough this canal after having been employed for irrigating the\r\nvarious fields, which extend for the distance of nearly 7 miles. The\r\ntotal amount of irrigable land which may be found between Joseph City\r\non the south and the point where the Sevier leaves its proper valley,\r\n65 miles to the northward, cannot be much less than 90,000 acres. The\r\nlimit of irrigation throughout this entire valley is the limit of the\r\nwater supply.\r\n\r\nThere is one other valley to which we must advert, namely, the\r\nvalley of the San Pete. This is fully equal in fertility and in the\r\nconvenience of every element connected with irrigation to the best\r\npart of the main valley of the Sevier. The San Pete is a stream of\r\nconsiderable magnitude, and experience has shown that it is probably\r\ncapable, under a more improved system of irrigation than that now in\r\nuse, of watering the greater portion of its valley. The cultivable\r\nacreage of the San Pete Valley is about 55,000 acres, provided the\r\nwhole could be watered.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water carried by the Sevier will now be considered.\r\nThis, of course, is highly variable from month to month. The time for\r\nmeasurement, if the true irrigating capacity of the stream is to be\r\nconsidered, should be that time at which the ratio of water in the\r\nstream to the amount required is smallest. At different stages of\r\ngrowth of the crops the amount of water required differs considerably.\r\nThe largest amount is needed about the time the seeds of the grain\r\nbegin to fill out. Ordinarily this is in the latter part of July and\r\nearly in August throughout the lower and most extensive portion of\r\nthe valley, and a week later in the upper portions. At this season\r\nthe water is not at its minimum. There is a gradual diminution of the\r\nflow during July, but the great shrinkage of the stream occurs during\r\nthe middle of August, just after, or sometimes even during, those\r\nirrigations in which the greatest amount is required. The critical\r\nperiod of the crops occurs, therefore, just before, and sometimes\r\ndangerously near, the period of rapid decline in the water supply.\r\nIt will therefore be evident that it is not a very easy matter to\r\ndetermine the exact stage of water which can serve as a criterion of\r\nthe irrigating capacity. My own measurements, however, were hardly a\r\nmatter of choice, but were made at the most advantageous period which\r\ncould be selected without interfering with the primary objects of the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nThe Sevier was measured at the junction of the two main forks, at the\r\nnorth end of Circle Valley, on the 6th and 7th of July. The method\r\nadopted was first to find a section of the water at a given point by\r\nsoundings and by actual measurement of the width of the water surfaces,\r\nand measuring the surface velocity by means of floats. The most\r\nprobable mean result of several measurements was found to be 410 cubic\r\nfeet per second for the East Fork, and 450 feet per second for the\r\nSouth Fork, or a total of 860 feet.\r\n\r\nWhile this measurement was made the South Fork was being drawn upon\r\nabove for the watering of about 1,100 acres near Panguitch, 35 miles\r\nfarther up the stream, and also for watering about 600 acres in Circle\r\nValley, about 3 to 4 miles above. The amount of water used in Circle\r\nValley was probably greater than that at Panguitch, since the method\r\nemployed was much more wasteful, and no provision made for returning\r\nthe tail water to the stream. On the other hand, a large proportion of\r\nthe tail water from both places finds its way back to the channel in\r\nspite of waste, but how much it is impossible to conjecture. I think,\r\nhowever, that 75 cubic feet per second would cover the loss from these\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nBelow the point of measurement the Sevier receives the following\r\naffluents: At Van Buren’s ranch is a cluster of very large springs,\r\nfurnishing about 55 cubic feet per second. Between Van Buren’s and\r\nMarysvale are three streams, yielding together about 30 feet, and\r\nBullion Creek at Marysvale carries about 40 feet. There is still\r\nanother affluent at Marysvale with about 30 feet. Finally, Clear\r\nCreek, north of Marysvale Cañon, gives about 45 feet, making the total\r\ncontributions between the junction of the forks and Joseph City about\r\n200 feet.\r\n\r\nAt Monroe a stream issues from the Sevier table, and is used for\r\nthe irrigation of the field cultivated by that settlement. Its flow\r\nis estimated at 40 feet in the middle of July. At Richfield, on the\r\nother side of the valley, is a stream coming from the Pavant, with a\r\nflow of about 20 feet, and at Glencove a stream of 25 feet. At Salina\r\nis a large tributary issuing from a great cañon through the north\r\nend of the Sevier Plateau, and its measurement indicated a flow of\r\n165 feet. The total between Monroe and Salina, inclusive, would thus\r\nreach 250 feet, to which might be added some smaller tributaries, not\r\nspecifically mentioned, amounting perhaps to 10 feet, giving a total of\r\n260 feet. Adding this to the tributaries between the upper forks and\r\nJoseph City, and to the main river itself, we have, as the total above\r\nGunnison, 1,320 feet. This estimate being for the early part of July,\r\nand obviously largely in excess of the amount which is available at\r\nthe critical period, in the last week of that month and the first week\r\nin August, what allowance should be made for the diminution of supply\r\nduring the month of July it is difficult to determine. The smaller\r\ntributaries, as a rule, shrink much more than the larger. Those which\r\nenter the stream lower down decline more during July than those which\r\njoin it farther up. Taken altogether, I am satisfied that it would be\r\nunsafe to estimate the irrigating capacity in the first week of August\r\nat more than 60 per cent. of that found in the first week of July,\r\nand I regard 50 per cent. as a much more probable estimate. For want\r\nof a better one, I adopt it, and this gives the estimated irrigating\r\ncapacity of the Sevier and its tributaries above the junction of the\r\nSan Pete at 660 cubic feet per second during the critical period.\r\n\r\nThe water supply in the San Pete Valley was measured by Mr. Renshawe\r\nduring the latter part of July, and found by him to be as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Volume of flowing water, in cubic feet per second, of streams in San\r\nPete Valley._\r\n\r\n                                   Feet.\r\n  Pleasant Creek                      28\r\n  Ephraim Creek                       28\r\n  Manti Creek                         28\r\n  Springtown Creek                    14\r\n  Fairview Creek                      10\r\n  Wales Creek                          6\r\n  Fountain Green                      10\r\n  Moroni                              10\r\n  Creek between Ephraim and Manti      5\r\n  Creek between Manti and Gunnison     5\r\n  Creek above Fairview                 2¹⁄₂\r\n  Twelve-mile Creek                   28\r\n  San Pete at Gunnison                60\r\n                                     -------\r\n      Total                          234¹⁄₂\r\n\r\nThis estimate is also liable to reduction, being undoubtedly a little\r\nin excess of the amount available at the critical period. This\r\nreduction may be as great as 15 per cent., which would leave very\r\nclosely 200 cubic feet as the water supply of the San Pete Valley,\r\nwhich, added to the total of the Sevier above Gunnison, gives for the\r\nwhole drainage system of the Sevier River a water supply of 860 feet\r\nper second at the time when the greatest amount is required.\r\n\r\nThe next factor to be inquired into is the amount of land which a cubic\r\nfoot per second of water can irrigate. This is, of course, highly\r\nvariable, depending upon the nature of the soil, and the economy with\r\nwhich the water is applied, and the frequency of the irrigations.\r\nNew lands freshly broken require much more water than the older ones\r\nwhich have been planted and watered for several years; and in fact the\r\nquantity diminishes with each season for a long term of years. In the\r\nSan Pete Valley, which has been longest cultivated, the decrease in\r\nthe amount of water applied to the oldest lands has not yet ceased,\r\nthough some fields have been cultivated with regularity since 1857.\r\nThe fresh soils are highly porous and absorptive, requiring a large\r\nquantity of water for their irrigation, and not retaining this moisture\r\nwell under the great evaporative power of a dry and hot atmosphere.\r\nWith successive irrigations, the pores of the soil are gradually closed\r\nand the earth is slowly compacted by the infiltration of impalpable\r\nsilt brought by the irrigating waters. It absorbs water much more\r\nslowly, and retains it a much longer time. There is, however, a check\r\nto this increased irrigating power, arising from a wasteful mode of\r\nagriculture. It has not been the practice to employ fertilizers,\r\nnor any other conservative means of keeping up the fertility of the\r\nsoil, and the yield of the crops growing smaller, the old lands are\r\nfrequently abandoned, and fresh adjoining lands are broken, planted,\r\nand watered. It has been the practice to cut the straw, which is never\r\nreturned as mulch; and, as there is but little rotation in crops, the\r\nresult can be easily comprehended. So long as new land costs nothing\r\nbut the labor to clear of the _Artemisia_ or sage brush, there is\r\nalways the tendency to invade it as rapidly as the old lands show\r\nsigns of fatigue. Thus the waters are constantly irrigating every\r\nyear a large proportion of new land, and the consumption of water is\r\ncorrespondingly great.\r\n\r\nA serious loss of water and fertility is produced by any method of\r\nirrigation which employs more water than is just sufficient to saturate\r\nthe soil. Whatever water runs off from a field carries with it great\r\nquantities of mud and fine silt, together with the most precious\r\nelements of fertility. These elements are the soluble alkaline salts\r\nand organic manner which are readily taken up by the water, and once\r\nremoved are not speedily restored. A field which is so irrigated that\r\na large surplus of water is continually running from the tail ditches\r\nduring the flow will rapidly deteriorate in fertility. But a field\r\nwhich receives water which is allowed to stand until it has soaked\r\ninto the earth, without any surplus passing into the tail ditches,\r\nwill increase in fertility. These irrigating waters bring with them a\r\nsufficiency of plant food to compensate, and more too, for the drain\r\nupon the soil caused by the harvest; but they will carry off more than\r\nthey bring if they are permitted to run over the field and escape from\r\nit, instead of being caught and held until they are absorbed. It is not\r\nalways practicable to attain this exact distribution of water, and many\r\ncases occur where great expense and labor might be required to arrange\r\nthe ditches and fields in this manner. Ordinarily, it is cheaper to\r\nthrow away old land and take up new than to improve the system of\r\nirrigation, and there are many fields in the valley of the Sevier which\r\nhave been abandoned because the fertility of the soil has been washed\r\nout by a reckless method of irrigation. Connected with this is another\r\nsource of waste, arising from very unequal requirements of contiguous\r\nareas, in consequence of which many lands, especially old ones, are\r\nliable to be excessively watered. When a community farms a large number\r\nof small fields, using water from the same canals, it is usually\r\nimpossible so to regulate the distribution of the privilege that each\r\nfield will receive the exact amount it needs. Some fields can remain\r\nunwatered much longer than others, and the tendency always is to get as\r\nmuch water as possible--each farmer fearing a deficiency of water and\r\nwasting its surplus. Experience on the part of the watermasters and a\r\nmore and more settled habit in the lands themselves gradually diminish\r\nthis source of loss and create economy. Far better results, therefore,\r\nmay ordinarily be anticipated in old lands than in new. Better results,\r\nalso, are found where circumstances render difficult or impracticable\r\nthe abandonment of old fields for new, and this is ordinarily in those\r\nportions where the water is nearly or quite sufficient for all the\r\nirrigable land, and where all the irrigable land is taken up.\r\n\r\nRecurring, then, to the inquiry as to the amount of land which a cubic\r\nfoot per second of running water will irrigate, this area is in many\r\nof the new lands as low as 40 acres, and it seldom exceeds 80 acres\r\nwith the old lands. Probably there are very few regions in the world\r\nwhere the demand of the soil for water is so great as here where the\r\nsupply is so small. In California a cubic foot of water is said to be\r\ncapable of irrigating more than a hundred acres, in India 200, and in\r\nSpain and Italy a much larger area. The reason is obvious. It is the\r\ndirect consequence of the extreme aridity of the climate of Utah. The\r\nirrigating capacity of the unit of water is even less in the southern\r\ncounties of Utah than in those around Great Salt Lake. Mr. Gilbert’s\r\nestimate of 100 acres for this last locality being accepted as the best\r\nthat can be hoped for, it will not be rating the factor too low to say\r\nthat 80 acres is the best that can be hoped for in the valley of the\r\nSevier. The present factor will not, I am convinced, have a higher\r\naverage value than 50 acres.\r\n\r\nThe total acreage, therefore, which can be irrigated in the drainage\r\nsystem of the Sevier by the present system of watering and of\r\nagriculture may be estimated at about 43,000 acres, and the greatest\r\nimprovements and economies in the system of farming and watering\r\ncannot, with the present water supply, be expected to raise the\r\nirrigable area above 70,000 acres.\r\n\r\n +----------------------------+------------+----------------+\r\n |                            |Square miles|Acres cultivated|\r\n |         Districts.         |cultivated  |     during     |\r\n |                            |during 1877.|     1877.      |\r\n +----------------------------+------------+----------------+\r\n |San Pete Valley             |    17      |       11,000   |\r\n |Gunnison                    |     4.4    |        2,800   |\r\n |Sevier Valley above Gunnison|    16.5    |       10,500   |\r\n |Circle Valley               |     1.2    |          750   |\r\n |Panguitch and above         |     2.8    |        1,800   |\r\n |                            +------------+----------------+\r\n |    Total                   |    41.9    |       26,850   |\r\n +----------------------------+------------+----------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n +----------------------------++---------------+--------------+\r\n |                            |Square miles of|Acres irrigable|\r\n |         Districts.         |irrigable land.|     land.     |\r\n |                            |               |               |\r\n +----------------------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n |San Pete Valley             |       31.2    |      20,000   |\r\n |Gunnison                    |        6.2    |       4,000   |\r\n |Sevier Valley above Gunnison|       54.7    |      35,000   |\r\n |Circle Valley               |        6.3    |       4,000   |\r\n |Panguitch and above         |       11      |       7,000   |\r\n |                            +---------------+---------------+\r\n |    Total                   |      109.4    |      70,000   |\r\n +----------------------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I am persuaded that it will be practicable to extend the\r\npossibility of irrigation by an increase of water supply to a degree\r\nsufficient to irrigate every acre of the main valley of the Sevier\r\nwhich can be reached by canals, and which is also fit for cultivation.\r\nIt is by the method of artificial reservoirs. There is probably no\r\nregion in the world more admirably suited to the easy, cheap, and\r\nefficient application of this method than this very region drained\r\nby the Sevier River. The sources of this river are found at high\r\naltitudes, but these high places are not mountains in the ordinary\r\nsense, but great plateaus with broad summits. These table tops have\r\nvast numbers of large basins broad enough for great ponds, which are\r\nnow drained by narrow gorges cut through volcanic sheets and leading\r\ndown to lower levels. These gorges are in most cases narrow cañons,\r\nwhich, being once barred across, will dam the waters above them. I\r\ncould not select a better example than the following: About 15 miles\r\nsouthwest of the town of Panguitch is a broad basin, the central part\r\nof which is occupied by a shallow lake, about 1¹⁄₄ miles long and\r\nnearly a mile wide, called Panguitch Lake. Its altitude is about 8,200\r\nfeet. It is completely surrounded with barriers, nowhere less than 100\r\nfeet in height, and finds its drainage through a narrow cleft on the\r\nnortheast side. It receives the influx of two fine streams, which in\r\nMay and June must carry heavy floods of water from the lofty rim and\r\nbroad watershed of the Panguitch Plateau lying to the westward. Even in\r\nAugust their united flow must reach 50 feet per second. By throwing a\r\ndam 30 feet high and 50 or 60 feet long across the outlet between its\r\nwalls of solid trachyte, a lake would be formed with an area of 6 or 7\r\nsquare miles. There are many such basins upon the Panguitch Plateau,\r\nand it would be a low estimate to say that it would be possible, at\r\ncomparatively small expense, to create 30 or 40 square miles of lake\r\nsurface, with an average depth of 20 feet, upon that plateau alone.\r\nThe precipitation upon its surface would be more than sufficient to\r\nfill these lakes every year. A dam across the upper part of East Fork\r\nCañon would create a lake behind it which might have an area of 12 to\r\n15 square miles. Numerous reservoirs could be created at small expense\r\nin Grass Valley, upon the Fish Lake Plateau, and upon the Sevier\r\nPlateau, and in those valleys which are drained by Salina Creek and its\r\ntributaries. The Sevier River itself can be cheaply dammed at several\r\ngorges and made to overflow swampy flats above--notably at the head\r\nof Marysvale Cañon, and again just north of Van Buren’s ranch. Other\r\nthings equal, it would be better, as well as cheaper, to build dams at\r\nhigher levels, since the evaporation is much less there than in the\r\nvalleys, and the natural facilities for creating lakes are also greater.\r\n\r\nIn this way, I believe it to be practicable to reserve a store of water\r\nsufficient to irrigate every acre of ground in the Sevier Valley, which\r\nis by the nature of its soil and its situation suitable for irrigation.\r\nIt may be noted, too, that the “tank system” thus suggested would not\r\ninterfere with or take the place of the present system, but would be\r\nsupplementary to it. The streams would in June and early July run\r\nthrough the lakes and over the dams, yielding about as much water as\r\nthey now yield in those months, and the reservoirs would not have to be\r\ndrawn upon before the middle of July.\r\n\r\nA very interesting subject connected with the peculiar conditions of\r\nagriculture in the west is the origin and distribution of alkaline\r\nsalts in the soil. In moist regions such occurrences are rare. They\r\nare peculiar to arid regions, and, in truth, very few arid regions\r\nfail to exhibit them. The cause in a general way is well known. The\r\nsmall amount of rain which falls during the wet season penetrates\r\ndeeply into the earth, where it gradually takes up such soluble salts\r\nas it encounters there. During the dry season which follows, there\r\nis always going on an evaporation from the surface, however dry it\r\nmay appear to the senses. It is a mistake to suppose that because the\r\nsaline soil is as dry as ashes no evaporation is in progress. In many\r\ncases this may be true; but often in the most arid regions there are\r\nmany localities where the water collects far below the immediate\r\nsurface. By capillary action, this water always tends to diffuse itself\r\nthroughout the loose materials which make up the overlying soils. As\r\nfast as it is evaporated at the surface, more water from below rises\r\nby capillary action to take its place. When the air is exceedingly\r\ndry, as it invariably is in summer throughout the whole Rocky Mountain\r\nRegion at moderate altitudes, the evaporative power becomes so great\r\nand extends to such a depth below the immediate surface, that we are\r\nunable to recognize the slightest traces of moisture indicating that\r\nevaporation is going on. The water which may have accumulated beneath\r\nhas gradually risen by percolation through the interstices of the\r\nunconsolidated materials of the soil, bringing with it whatever soluble\r\nsalts it may have taken into solution during its sojourn beneath the\r\nsurface. These soluble salts are left at the surface by the final\r\nevaporation of the water, and, as the process is continuous until the\r\nreservoir beneath is exhausted, the salts accumulate. Contrast this now\r\nwith the action going on in a moist country. Here the copious waters\r\nwash the soils as rapidly as the salts come up from below, and carry\r\nthem in solution into the drainage channels. During the greater part of\r\nthe year the movement of the waters is partly from the surface downward\r\ninto the subterranean water courses, from which they emerge in springs;\r\npartly by surface drainages into rills, and thence into living streams.\r\nBy both movements, any tendency to accumulate soluble salts at the\r\nsurface during the relatively brief periods of dryness is prevented.\r\nIn a dry country the periods of dryness are very much longer, and the\r\nrainfall is seldom sufficient to wash the accumulated salts from the\r\nsoil. There is, however, usually a limit to this accumulation, since\r\nat long intervals rains occur sufficient to remove a large portion of\r\nthe salts. The difference between a dry and wet country in this respect\r\nis therefore one of degree rather than of kind. In a dry country\r\nthe periods of accumulation of salts at the surface are long and\r\ncontinuous, while the washings of the soil are rare and imperfect. In a\r\nwet country the periods of accumulation are short and rare, while the\r\nwashings are frequent, copious, and thorough.\r\n\r\nThe saline materials vary widely in character and constitution. They\r\nare, however, chiefly salts of soda, lime, potash, and magnesia.\r\nSometimes they exist in the condition of chlorides, sometimes of\r\ncarbonates, and sometimes of sulphates. The reactions from which\r\nthey are derived are many, and it will be proper here to give only a\r\nfew illustrations. A portion of the salts of magnesia and soda are\r\nderived from the decomposition, by atmospheric influences, of volcanic,\r\ngranitic, and other crystalline rocks. Where these materials exist in\r\nthe form of felspar, hornblende, and pyroxene, the great decomposing\r\nagent is water charged with the carbonic acid of the atmosphere, by\r\nthe action of which soda, magnesia, and lime are, with inconceivable\r\nslowness, dissolved out of the constituents of these rocks. There is no\r\nstream, however pure it may apparently be, which does not carry more or\r\nless of chlorides and carbonates in solution. The sulphates are derived\r\nmainly from subterranean sources. In the Rocky Mountain Region, one of\r\nthe most common forms of sulphate is found very abundantly in the rocks\r\nof the Carboniferous, Triassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary Ages, in the\r\nforms of gypsum and selenite, which are sulphates of lime. Whenever\r\nwaters containing carbonate of soda are filtered through strata\r\ncontaining these sulphates, a double decomposition takes place, by\r\nwhich carbonate of lime and sulphate of soda are formed. The carbonate\r\nof lime is very slightly soluble in water, while the sulphate of soda\r\nis highly so, and it is well known that waters emanating from the\r\nsedimentary rocks just spoken of are very frequently highly charged\r\nwith it. Such, doubtless, is the origin of this mineral in the so\r\ncalled alkaline waters of the west, and of all the soluble minerals\r\nwhich pass under the name of alkali it is one of the most common.\r\nCarbonate of soda is also abundant in the soils. It is frequently found\r\nin the summer time, coating the surface of bottom lands which earlier\r\nin the season have been submerged by the augmented streams. Common salt\r\n(chloride of sodium) is even more abundant than the sulphate. It is\r\nwell known, however, that many of the sedimentary rocks, particularly\r\nthose of the Triassic and Jurassic Age, contain an abundance of it,\r\nand there are many localities in the west where a very fair article\r\nof common salt is obtained by the lixiviation of the detritus of the\r\nred Triassic rocks. Incrustations of these soluble saline materials\r\noccur most abundantly in the vicinity of the rivers and in the bottom\r\nlands. This may at first seem somewhat strange, but it is susceptible\r\nof a ready explanation. In order that these salts may accumulate at\r\nthe surface, there must be going on continually a slow transmission\r\nof moisture from under ground upward, and since a continuous supply\r\nof water is more frequently found in the bottom lands than elsewhere,\r\nit follows that the conditions of these accumulations are here more\r\nfrequently fulfilled. They may, however, and do occur at localities\r\nwhich probably contain subterranean reservoirs of water, which are\r\nannually filled during the wet season. Sometimes these salts are so\r\nabundant that the land requires a thorough washing before it is fit for\r\nagriculture, and the Mormons have on several occasions, when founding\r\nsettlements, been obliged to allow the waters from their ditches to\r\nleach the land for many months, and in one or two cases for two, and\r\neven three, years, before a good crop could be raised. There is no\r\ndifficulty, however, in removing any quantity of these readily soluble\r\nsalts from the soil, provided this leaching process be continued long\r\nenough; and it is usually found that lands which were originally highly\r\nakaline become, when reclaimed from their alkalinity, among the most\r\nfertile.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere yet remains for mention a number of small areas served by some\r\nminor streams in southwestern Utah. These little creeks head in the\r\nmountains, but are soon lost in the deserts of that arid and torrid\r\nregion, none of their waters finding their way to the ocean. The\r\ngreater number of them belong to the drainage basin of Sevier Lake.\r\nIn each case the water supply is small, and inadequate to supply the\r\navailable land. In nearly every case the competence of the supply\r\nhas been determined in the most practical way--by the operations of\r\nsettlers; but some allowance has been made for an increase of the\r\nirrigable land by the more economic use of the water. This can be\r\naccomplished by the construction of better waterways, and by more\r\ncarefully flowing the water over the lands.\r\n\r\nThe following table exhibits the extent of these areas:\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------+-------+--------+\r\n  |                                        | Square|        |\r\n  |               Districts.               | miles.| Acres. |\r\n  +----------------------------------------+-------+--------+\r\n  |Cherry Creek                            |    .2 |    100 |\r\n  |Judd Creek                              |    .2 |    100 |\r\n  |Levan                                   |   3.1 |  2,000 |\r\n  |Scipio                                  |   2.6 |  1,700 |\r\n  |Holden                                  |   1.6 |  1,000 |\r\n  |Fillmore and Oak Creek                  |   5.5 |  3,500 |\r\n  |Meadow Creek                            |   1.9 |  1,200 |\r\n  |Kanosh                                  |   3.1 |  2,000 |\r\n  |Beaver Creek and tributaries            |  21.9 | 14,000 |\r\n  |Paragoonah                              |   1.5 |  1,000 |\r\n  |Parowan                                 |   1.5 |  1,000 |\r\n  |Summit                                  |    .6 |    400 |\r\n  |Cedar City, Iron City, and Fort Hamilton|   3.6 |  2,300 |\r\n  |Mountain Meadows                        |    .3 |    200 |\r\n  |Pinto                                   |    .3 |    200 |\r\n  |Hebron                                  |   1.6 |  1,000 |\r\n  |                                        +-------+--------+\r\n  |      Total                             |  49.5 | 31,700 |\r\n  +----------------------------------------+-------+--------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n IRRIGABLE LANDS OF THAT PORTION OF UTAH DRAINED BY THE COLORADO RIVER\r\n                         AND ITS TRIBUTARIES.\r\n\r\n                          BY A. H. THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat portion of Utah drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries\r\nbelongs to a great basin limited on the north by the Uinta Mountains\r\nand on the west by the high plateaus that separate the drainage of the\r\nColorado from that of the salt lakes of the interior, and extending\r\nbeyond the limits of the Territory on the east and south. The floor\r\nof this basin is extremely rough, being broken by isolated groups of\r\nrugged mountains, by plateaus encircled with cliffs of almost vertical\r\nrock, by mesas and amphitheaters, and huge monumental and castellated\r\nbuttes. Everywhere the surface is cut and carved with a network of\r\ncañons, hundreds and often thousands of feet in depth.\r\n\r\nThe main channel through which its drainage passes to the sea is the\r\nColorado, and its proper upper continuation, the Green River.\r\n\r\nThe principal tributaries to these streams from the east are the White,\r\nthe Grand, and the San Juan Rivers--all rising in the high mountains\r\neast of the Territory and flowing in a general westerly course--the\r\nWhite entering the Green River, the Grand uniting with the Green to\r\nform the Colorado, and the San Juan entering the latter about 125 miles\r\nbelow the junction of the Grand and the Green. The Virgin, the Kanab,\r\nthe Paria, the Escalante, the Fremont, the San Rafael, the Price, the\r\nMinnie Maud, the Uinta, and Ashley Fork are the principal tributaries\r\nfrom the west.\r\n\r\nThis portion of Utah is but sparsely settled by white people, the only\r\npermanent locations being in the southwestern part, and in the Uinta\r\nValley at the north. Information concerning its agricultural resources\r\nis limited, being confined, except in relation to the localities\r\nbefore mentioned, to data collected by the geographical and geological\r\nparties of this survey. Many of the streams have been visited but a\r\nsingle time, and different streams at widely different dates, during a\r\nfield season. Often the exigencies of the survey prevented as close an\r\nexamination into the flow of water, and the location and character of\r\nthe soil of the arable tracts, as was desirable; yet, on the whole, it\r\nis thought that the data collected can be relied upon as a very close\r\napproximation.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the basin is one of extreme aridity. The prevailing wind\r\nis westerly. The high plateaus and mountains forming the western rim\r\nof the basin force these winds up to an altitude above the sea of over\r\n10,000 feet, and thus act as great condensers to deprive them of their\r\nmoisture. Flowing down from the higher lands into the warmer regions\r\nbelow, their capacity for absorption is increased, and during the\r\ngreater portion of the year the winds abstract from rather than add to\r\nthe humidity of the lower altitudes. But little is known concerning the\r\nactual amount of precipitation of moisture within the basin. Below an\r\naltitude of 7,000 feet it is very small, probably not over an average\r\nof 5 inches yearly. At higher altitudes it is much greater, probably\r\nreaching 24 inches, but this is mostly during the winter months and in\r\nthe form of snow.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the region under consideration is from 2,500 feet to\r\n11,500 feet above the sea, thus giving great range in temperature. In\r\nthe valleys of the extreme southwestern portion an almost subtropical\r\nwarmth is experienced, and the different valleys containing arable\r\nlands we pass from these by insensible gradations to those where\r\nfrosts occur during every month in the year. Generally, the limit of\r\nsuccessful cultivation of the soil is below 7,000 feet.\r\n\r\nIn this portion of Utah irrigation is essential to agriculture. If\r\nall the single acres it is possible to cultivate without artificial\r\nirrigation were aggregated, I do not believe the sum would reach\r\none-fourth of one square mile, and every foot of this meager amount\r\nis irrigated naturally. Springs are of infrequent occurrence. The\r\ngreat source of the water supply is the streams fed by the rains and\r\nsnows of the high table lands and mountains. All these streams have a\r\nrapid fall in their upper courses, and are here often of considerable\r\nsize; but upon reaching the lower and more level country their waters\r\nare rapidly absorbed by the porous soil and evaporated by the higher\r\ntemperature. So great is the loss from these causes that some streams\r\nfail to reach the main drainage channel during the warmer months, and\r\nall are greatly shrunken in volume. All the arable lands--or lands\r\nwhere altitude, slope of surface, and quality of soil permit successful\r\ncultivation, if a supply of water can be obtained, and from which lands\r\nto irrigate, or irrigable lands, may be selected--are in the valleys\r\nadjacent to the streams. Usually this area in many valleys is in excess\r\nof that which the water in the streams can irrigate, and choice in the\r\nlocation of lands to cultivate is often practicable. In this report\r\nI have considered irrigable lands to be such only as possess all the\r\nnecessary qualifications of altitude, slope of surface, and fertility\r\nof soil, and have, in addition, an available supply of one cubic foot\r\nof water per second for each hundred acres. The great dissimilarity\r\nbetween the valleys makes it desirable to consider the drainage basin\r\nof each separately, in respect to arable lands, irrigable lands, volume\r\nof water, and practicability of increasing this supply during the\r\nirrigating season.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE VIRGIN RIVER.\r\n\r\nThis stream is in the extreme southwest corner of the area under\r\nconsideration. Its branches rise in the Colob Plateau, at altitudes\r\nvarying from 8,000 to 10,000 feet above the sea. It flows in a\r\nsouthwesterly course, and joins the Colorado beyond the boundaries of\r\nUtah. The smaller creeks draining the eastern portion of the plateau\r\nunite, after descending to an altitude of 5,500 feet above the sea,\r\nand form what is called the Pa-ru-nu-weap Fork of the Virgin. At and\r\nbelow the junction of these creeks, the cañon valley in which they\r\nflow widens into what is known as Long Valley. There a considerable\r\narea of available land is found. The soil is excellent, and wherever\r\ncultivated yields abundant crops. Below Long Valley the stream enters\r\nPa-ru-nu-weap Cañon, and is simply a series of cascades for 15 miles,\r\ndescending in this distance from 5,000 to 3,500 feet above the sea\r\nlevel. Emerging, it enters the valley of the Virgin. This valley is 44\r\nmiles in length. Its upper portion is only an enlargement of the cañon,\r\nin which small areas of available land are found. Its lower portion is\r\na broader valley, much broken by low, basalt covered mesas, and sharp\r\nridges of tilted sedimentary rocks. In the upper portion of the valley\r\nthe river receives several accessions, the principal ones being Little\r\nZion, North Fork, La Verkin, and Ash Creeks. With the exception of\r\nthe Ash, but very little cultivable land is found along these creeks.\r\nMidway in the valley two streams enter, coming from the Pine Valley\r\nMountains and having small areas of irrigable land along their courses,\r\nand near the foot the Santa Clara River adds its water. The united\r\nstreams leave the valley by a deep cañon cut through the Beaver Dam\r\nMountains. The valley of the Virgin has a lower altitude than any other\r\nportion of Utah, and a warmer climate. The soil of the arable lands is\r\nusually good, and wherever it is possible to irrigate produces abundant\r\ncrops. Some little difficulty is occasionally experienced in the first\r\nyears of cultivation from an excess of alkaline constituents in the\r\nsoil, but plentiful applications of water soon remove this difficulty,\r\nand these lands often become the most productive. No reliable data\r\nconcerning the amount of arable land in the drainage basin, or the\r\nvolume of water carried by the Virgin River and its tributaries, have\r\nbeen collected. From the best information attainable, the amount of\r\nland actually irrigated in 1875, is placed at eleven square miles.\r\nThis conclusion is based in the main upon returns made in 1875 to\r\nthe Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society, the amount under\r\ncultivation in Long Valley having been ascertained by Mr. J. H.\r\nRenshawe, of this survey. To irrigate this, all the water in most of\r\nthe tributary streams is used, but a large surplus remains in the main\r\nriver. The amount of arable land is far in excess of the water supply,\r\nbut some considerable expense for dams and canals would be necessary to\r\nutilize the whole amount.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that a portion of the Virgin River can be used to\r\nadvantage below the Beaver Dam Mountains in Nevada, and that a\r\nsufficient amount to irrigate 25 square miles can be used to good\r\nadvantage in Utah.\r\n\r\nThe time when the volume of available water furnished by any stream\r\nbears the least ratio to the demands of the growing crops is the\r\nmost critical period in the cultivation of the soil where artificial\r\nirrigation is a necessity. This time, depending as it does upon the\r\ncrops cultivated, the character of the soil, and the source of the\r\nwater supply, whether from springs or from melting snows, differs in\r\ndifferent localities. In the valley of the Virgin it occurs in June.\r\n\r\nAt this time the river, though not at flood height, which occurs in\r\nApril, carries a large volume of water, and, by reason of the source of\r\nthis supply being in the rapidly melting snows of the Colob Plateau, is\r\ndecreasing but slowly, and thus the amount available at this critical\r\nperiod bears a greater ratio to the flood of the stream than is usual\r\nin Utah. But little information has been obtained concerning the amount\r\nof water necessary to irrigate an acre. It is thought, however, to be\r\nmuch greater than in any other portion of Utah.\r\n\r\n\r\nKANAB CREEK.\r\n\r\nKanab Creek rises in springs bursting from underneath the cliffs\r\nforming the southern boundary of the Pauns-a-gunt Plateau, and flows\r\nsouthward until it joins the Colorado River in Arizona. Small areas\r\nof arable land are found along its course after it has descended to\r\nan altitude of 7,500 feet, and thence until it passes beyond the\r\nboundaries of Utah. The largest area in one body is in Kanab Valley, at\r\nthe foot of the Vermilion Cliffs. It is greatly in excess of the water\r\nsupply, is at an altitude of about 5,000 feet, has a fertile soil, and\r\nrequires but comparatively a small amount of irrigation. The amount\r\nactually under cultivation in 1877 is placed by the best information\r\nattainable at 700 acres. The critical period in the cultivation of this\r\narea occurs in June. At that time the stream is falling rapidly, and\r\ncrops have sometimes been seriously damaged. Estimates of the volume of\r\nwater in the stream, made at different seasons and in different years,\r\ngive 15 cubic feet per second as the flow in June. Some desultory\r\nattempts have been made to increase the supply by ponding, the cañon\r\nthrough the Vermilion Cliffs above the arable lands affording many\r\nopportunities. When this improvement is made on some well considered\r\nand well executed plan, and the waterways flumed through some bad\r\nsandy ground that now absorbs much water, the amount available at the\r\ncritical period can be at least doubled.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a settlement was established at the foot of the\r\nPink Cliffs, on the headwaters of the Kanab, but the town site was\r\neventually abandoned because of the deep snows of winter and the frosts\r\nof summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PARIA RIVER.\r\n\r\nThe Paria River rises under the eastern escarpment of the Pauns-a-gunt\r\nPlateau, at about the same altitude as Kanab Creek, and flows in a\r\nsouthwesterly course for 100 miles, joining the Colorado in Arizona.\r\nThrough the greater part of its course the river flows in a deep cañon,\r\nbut near its head, and at an altitude of 6,000 feet, the cañon expands\r\ninto a valley. Lower in its course, and at an altitude of 4,500 feet,\r\nthe cañon again widens into a smaller valley. These are the only areas\r\nof arable lands within its drainage basin in Utah. The larger contains\r\n15 and the smaller 10 square miles. In August, 1874, this stream flowed\r\n30 cubic feet per second in the upper valley. The flow in the lower\r\nwould be one-third greater. High water occurs in April or early in\r\nMay. At this time the volume is three times greater than in August.\r\nSettlements have been made in both valleys, and quite a large area is\r\nunder cultivation. The soil is excellent.\r\n\r\nThe critical period in irrigation is the latter part of June or early\r\nin July. At this time the stream probably carries 40 feet per second.\r\nThe land in the lower valley is much subject to flooding from heavy\r\nshowers that, falling on the table lands and mesas in the upper portion\r\nof the drainage basin, pour a torrent often beyond the capacity of the\r\nchannel to convey through the lower valley. So great was the damage\r\ndone by these floods in sweeping away dams, breaking through ditches,\r\nand inundating the growing crops at the site first selected for\r\nsettlement, that it was abandoned after three years’ occupation, and\r\nother parts, where these sudden rushes could be controlled, selected.\r\nConsiderable difficulty has been experienced in the lower valley from\r\nthe vast amount of argillaceous sediment deposited on it. So great\r\nduring the floods is this deposit from the water used in irrigation\r\nthat the ground becomes completely coated with an impervious layer, and\r\ngrowing crops, especially of small grains, suffer from the inability of\r\nthe soil to absorb the water conducted on it. The irrigating capacity\r\nof this stream during the critical period could be greatly increased by\r\nthe construction of reservoirs in which to store the great surplus of\r\nwater that flows earlier in the season. The cañons above the valleys\r\noffer very favorable opportunities for building the necessary dams and\r\nembankments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE ESCALANTE RIVER.\r\n\r\nThis stream enters the Colorado next north of the Paria. It rises\r\nunder the wall forming the eastern face of the Aquarius Plateau; flows\r\nfirst northeast, then east, and finally southeast, before reaching the\r\nColorado. Its length is 90 miles, the lower three-fourths being in a\r\nnarrow cañon having vertical walls ranging from 900 to 1,200 feet in\r\nheight. Through this gorge the river sweeps, sometimes filling the\r\nwhole space from wall to wall; sometimes winding from side to side in\r\na flood plain of sand, and always shifting its bed more or less with\r\nevery freshet. Not an acre of accessible arable land is known in the\r\nwhole length of the cañon, and its depth precludes the possibility of\r\nusing the waters of the river on the lands above. Near the head of the\r\nsouthern branch of the Escalante, in what is known as Potato Valley,\r\nand at an elevation of about 5,000 feet, is an area of about 6 square\r\nmiles of available land. The flow of water in this branch was 90 cubic\r\nfeet per second in July, 1875. A portion of this area is now under\r\ncultivation, and is said to produce good crops. A portion of the east\r\nflank of the Aquarius Plateau is drained by a number of creeks that\r\njoin the Escalante in the deep gorge below Potato Valley; but they\r\nall enter close cañons, in which no areas of arable land are known at\r\nan altitude low enough for successful cultivation. Part of the waters\r\nof these creeks might be used to irrigate grass lands at an altitude\r\nof about 8,000 feet; but the conditions of pasturage are such in this\r\nregion that the amount practically available is small.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE FREMONT RIVER.\r\n\r\nThe largest branch of this stream rises in the Un-ca-pa-ga Mountains,\r\nand after flowing in an easterly direction for 125 miles enters the\r\nColorado about 40 miles below the junction of the Grand and Green. It\r\nis joined by one considerable tributary, Curtis Creek, from the north,\r\nand another smaller, Tantalus Creek, from the south. The lower half\r\nof its course is through two deep cañons, separated by an intervening\r\nvalley called Graves Valley, in which is an area of 10 square miles of\r\narable land, with an altitude of 4,500 feet above sea level. On the\r\nupper waters of the main river, in what is known as Rabbit Valley, and\r\nat an altitude of nearly 7,000 feet, are 25 square miles of arable\r\nland of good quality. This area, from its altitude, should be subject\r\nto late and early frosts, but the warm sandy soil and southeastern\r\nslope of the whole valley will probably prevent much damage from this\r\ncause. The valley is now used as a herd ground for cattle belonging\r\nto the settlements in Sevier Valley, and the few experiments made by\r\nthe herdsmen in cultivating the soil also indicate that the danger to\r\nbe apprehended is slight. The volume of water flowing through Rabbit\r\nValley in July, 1875, was 175 cubic feet per second.\r\n\r\nTantalus Creek drains the northern portion of the eastern slope of the\r\nAquarius Plateau. It enters a close cañon at 8,000 feet altitude, and\r\ncontinues in cañons until it has passed through Water Pocket Fold. It\r\nthen flows along a desolate valley at the foot of the fold until it\r\njoins the Fremont River. During the warmer months the water in this\r\ncreek is usually absorbed and evaporated before reaching its mouth. In\r\nthe valley at the foot of Water Pocket Fold are about 10 square miles\r\nof arable land; but the almost inaccessible situation of the valley and\r\nthe desolation and ruggedness of the surrounding country may present\r\ninsurmountable obstacles to its settlement.\r\n\r\nCurtis Creek, the northern tributary of Fremont River, is formed by\r\nthe union of several smaller streams that rise in the Wasatch Plateau.\r\nDebouching from the plateau, these branches flow across what is known\r\nas Castle Valley, and here, at an altitude of 6,000 feet, are 25 square\r\nmiles of good arable land. They were measured in September, 1876, and\r\ngave an aggregated flow of 47 cubic feet per second. As they derive a\r\ngreater part of their waters from the melting snows on the plateau,\r\ndouble this amount, or 94 cubic feet, would not be an overestimate\r\nof the volume during the irrigating season. After the union of these\r\nbranches, the united stream flows in a deep cañon until near its\r\njunction with the Fremont River in Graves Valley. Both Curtis Creek and\r\nthe Fremont receive some accessions to their volume from springs in\r\nthe cañons through which they flow above this valley. If all the water\r\nin their upper courses should be used to irrigate lands in Castle and\r\nRabbit Valleys, a sufficient amount would be returned to their channels\r\nby percolation to irrigate, with the addition of the accessions in the\r\ncañons, all the arable land in Graves Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SAN RAFAEL RIVER.\r\n\r\nThis stream flows in an easterly course, and enters the Green 32\r\nmiles above the junction of that stream with the Grand. It has three\r\nprincipal branches--Ferron, Cottonwood, and Huntington Creeks--all\r\nrising in the Wasatch Plateau at an altitude of about 10,000 feet.\r\nThese streams have a rapid fall in their upper courses, and leave\r\nthe plateau through almost impassable cañons cut in its eastern wall\r\noverlooking Castle Valley. They flow across that at intervals of a few\r\nmiles apart, and, then uniting, cut a deep, narrow cañon through the\r\nSan Rafael Swell. Emerging from the swell, the river flows across a\r\nlow, broken country until its junction with the Green. The largest body\r\nof arable land within the drainage basin of the San Rafael is in Castle\r\nValley, a long, narrow depression lying between the eastern escarpment\r\nof the Wasatch Plateau and the San Rafael Swell. It is nearly 60 miles\r\nin length from north to south, and has an average elevation of 6,000\r\nfeet above the sea. Its southern end, as has been before mentioned,\r\nis drained by the tributaries of Curtis Creek, the central portion by\r\nthe three streams forming the San Rafael, and the northern by Price\r\nRiver. No permanent settlements have been made in the valley, but it is\r\nmuch used as a winter herding ground for stock owned by the settlers\r\nin other portions of Utah. Lying near the branches of the San Rafael\r\nthat cross it, and in such position that the water can be easily\r\nconducted over it, are 200 square miles of arable land, generally of\r\ngood quality. East of the San Rafael Swell, and lying on both sides of\r\nthe river, at an altitude of 4,000 feet, are 20 square miles of arable\r\nland, which could be easily irrigated. The river was carefully measured\r\nin July, 1876, and the volume of flow found to be 1,676 cubic feet per\r\nsecond. The three branches in Castle Valley were also measured, with\r\nresults closely approximating the measurement of the united streams.\r\nThese measurements were made at high water, though not when the streams\r\nwere at their flood. As most of this volume is derived from the melting\r\nsnow, which rarely disappears from the high plateau before the middle\r\nof July, the flow would be maintained with considerable steadiness\r\nduring a large part of what would be the critical period in the\r\nirrigation of this valley. After the middle of July the decrease would\r\nbe very rapid until September, and the lowest stage of water reached\r\nabout the first of October, when the river would not flow probably more\r\nthan 400 cubic feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PRICE RIVER.\r\n\r\nThis river rises in the angle formed by the intersection of the Wasatch\r\nand Western Tavaputs Plateaus, receiving tributaries from both these\r\ntable lands, and has a general easterly course for 100 miles. It\r\ncrosses the northern end of Castle Valley, and then flows through a\r\nbroken country near the foot of the escarpment called the Book Cliffs,\r\nforming the southern boundary of the Tavaputs Plateau, till within 20\r\nmiles of the Green River, when it cuts through this escarpment into the\r\nplateau and joins the Green a few miles above the foot of Gray Cañon.\r\nThe arable lands along its course are mostly found in Castle Valley,\r\nwhere there are at least 50 square miles--a quantity considerably in\r\nexcess of the irrigating capacity of the stream. The volume of water\r\nwas measured in July, 1877, a few miles below where it debouches into\r\nCastle Valley, and found to be 189 cubic feet per second. It must\r\nsuffer great loss from absorption, as the volume when leaving the\r\ncliffs is much greater, and the aggregated flow of the branches on the\r\nplateaus is at least twice as great.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MINNIE MAUD CREEK.\r\n\r\nThis stream rises in the broken country, where the Western Tavaputs\r\nand Wasatch Plateaus break into the Uinta Mountains. It has a general\r\neasterly course, and joins the Green midway in the Cañon of Desolation.\r\nFor the greater part of its course it flows in a cañon that widens\r\nenough occasionally to give a small area of arable land. One such area,\r\ncontaining 6 square miles, occurs at an altitude of 5,500 feet. Here\r\nthe volume of water was measured in July, 1877, and found to be 16\r\ncubic feet per second.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE UINTA RIVER.\r\n\r\nThis is the largest tributary emptying into the main drainage channel\r\nfrom the west. It rises in the Uinta Mountains, and has a southerly\r\ncourse for 65 miles. The Duchesne River, its western branch, rises in\r\nthe same mountains, and the two streams unite only a few miles before\r\nthe Uinta joins the Green. The drainage basin of the Uinta has an\r\narea of 1,300 square miles, lying between the altitudes of 4,500 and\r\n7,000 feet above the sea. It has, generally speaking, a regular slope\r\nfrom the foot of the Uinta Mountains to the mouth of the streams,\r\nor in a direction toward the southeast. The surface of the basin is\r\ngreatly diversified, consisting of broad reaches of bottom lands along\r\nthe rivers; elevated, level, or gently sloping benches, sometimes\r\npartially arable, but oftener gravelly barrens; broken, rock-faced\r\nterraces; and low cliffs and ridges. It is difficult to estimate the\r\namount of arable land. All the bottom lands are such, and can be easily\r\nirrigated. The streams have a rapid fall, but flow near the surface,\r\nand no deep cañons are found anywhere in the basin. This renders it\r\npossible to conduct the water over considerable areas of bench land,\r\nand wherever the soil of these is sufficiently fertile, selections\r\nof good farming land can be made. Above the limit in altitude for\r\nsuccessful cultivation, large tracts of meadow lands can be irrigated.\r\nThose best acquainted with the extent of these classes of land place\r\nthe arable, including irrigable natural meadow lands, at 40 per cent.\r\nof the whole basin. This would give an area of 520 square miles, and\r\nI do not think it is an overestimate. The volume of water flowing in\r\nthe Duchesne River above its junction with Lake Fork was measured in\r\nAugust, 1877, and found to be 1,011 cubic feet per second. The Uinta\r\nwas measured above its junction with the Duchesne in October, 1877,\r\nand then flowed 214 cubic feet per second. These streams all rise in\r\nhigh mountains, from whose summits the snow is never completely melted.\r\nThe line of highest water is usually in June, but the flow is well\r\nsustained through July. After that the volume rapidly decreases, and\r\nlowest water occurs in October. The critical period in the irrigation\r\nof this basin would occur in August. I think it may safely be assumed\r\nthat the measurements of the Duchesne and the Uinta represent the flow\r\nat the critical period, but that Lake Fork should be doubled. This\r\nwould give 1,825 cubic feet per second, or enough to irrigate, at the\r\nassumed standard, 285 square miles, or 22 per cent. of the whole area\r\nof the basin, and indicates the Uinta drainage as one of the best, if\r\nnot the best, agricultural valley in Utah.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ASHLEY FORK.\r\n\r\nThis stream is the most northern tributary of the Green River south of\r\nthe Uinta Mountains. It rises in that range, but at a lower altitude\r\nthan the branches of the Uinta, and has a southeasterly course 48 miles\r\nin length. On its lower course, at an altitude of 5,500 feet, are 75\r\nsquare miles of arable land of excellent quality, a few acres of which\r\nare now cultivated. There is sufficient water in the stream during the\r\ncritical season to irrigate 25 square miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HENRYS FORK.\r\n\r\nBut a small portion of the valley of Henrys Fork lies within the\r\nTerritory of Utah, but this portion includes its best lands. A\r\nbeautiful natural meadow is here found, affording a large quantity of\r\nhay to the ranchmen of that country. The altitude is great, the valley\r\nbeing 6,000 feet above the level of the sea, and hence liable to late\r\nand early frosts.\r\n\r\nAbout 10 square miles can be redeemed by irrigation. The volume of\r\nthe stream is sufficient to irrigate a much larger tract, but a part\r\nis needed for other lands which lie farther up the river, within the\r\nTerritory of Wyoming.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE WHITE RIVER.\r\n\r\nThe White River enters the Green from the east, about two miles below\r\nthe mouth of the Uinta. This stream rises in Colorado, and has only a\r\nsmall portion of its course in Utah, but lying within the boundaries\r\nof the Territory are 75 square miles of arable land which may be\r\nirrigated with its water. The river was measured in October, 1877, near\r\nits mouth, and flowed 734 cubic feet per second. High water usually\r\noccurs in June, and the critical period in the irrigation of the land\r\nis probably in August, when the stream should flow at least double\r\nthe volume of October, or, 1,468 cubic feet per second. This would be\r\ngreatly in excess of the amount needed to irrigate the available land\r\nin Utah, and, from the best information attainable, it seems doubtful\r\nif it could be used higher up on the course of the stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE GREEN RIVER.\r\n\r\n_Brown’s Park._--Brown’s Park is a valley through which the Green River\r\nmeanders. Three or four small streams head in the mountains to the\r\nnorth and a like number in the mountains to the south and find their\r\nway into the river in the midst of the park. But a small portion of the\r\npark lies within Utah and the small streams will be used for irrigation\r\nin the portion which falls in Colorado. The flood plain lands of the\r\nGreen are extensive, and here many natural meadow lands are found,\r\ninterspersed with fine groves of cottonwood. Some of the bench lands\r\nare well adapted to irrigation, but a portion of them and the foot\r\nhills back of them are naked, valueless bad-lands.\r\n\r\nWhen the general industries of the country shall warrant the great\r\nexpenditure necessary, the Green will be taken out to irrigate the\r\nbench lands on either side. About 10 square miles of these bench lands\r\nwill fall within Utah.\r\n\r\n_Below Split Mountain Cañon._--Lying along the Green, and between\r\nthe foot of Split Mountain Cañon and the mouth of the Uinta, are 50\r\nsquare miles of arable land. Some portions of this may be subject to\r\ninundations at times of extraordinary floods, but the greater part\r\nis above high water mark. Green River here carries sufficient water\r\nto irrigate many times this amount of land, and while the cost for\r\nthe construction of suitable dams and canals would be greater than on\r\nsmaller streams, neither this nor the engineering skill required would\r\nbe beyond the resources of any ordinary settlement.\r\n\r\n_Gunnison Valley._--In Gunnison Valley, below the foot of Gray Cañon,\r\nare 25 square miles of arable land. The cost of constructing the\r\nnecessary irrigation works at this point would be greater than above\r\nthe mouth of the Uinta, but still not beyond the ability of a colony.\r\nGreen River flowed in Gunnison Valley in September, 1877, 4,400 cubic\r\nfeet of water per second, enough to irrigate at the standard adopted\r\n860 square miles. There seems to be no arable land to which it is\r\npossible to take this great surplus, and probably for many years to\r\ncome it will be suffered to flow “unvexed to the sea”.\r\n\r\nThe area colored on the map is much greater than above indicated. The\r\nselections of irrigable lands will be made on either side of the river,\r\nin patches, within the colored district.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE GRAND RIVER.\r\n\r\nThe Grand River has but a small amount of arable land along its course\r\nin Utah, and flows for most of the distance in a close cañon. The\r\nvolume of the stream, about 40 miles above its junction with the Green,\r\nwas measured in September, 1877, and found to be 4,860 feet per second.\r\nIt is probable that selections can be made to the extent of 40 square\r\nmiles from the areas colored on the map.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SAN JUAN RIVER.\r\n\r\nBut little is known concerning the arable lands or volume of water in\r\nthe valley of the San Juan. It flows for the most of its course through\r\nUtah in a cañon, and all the arable land is thought to be so much\r\nsubject to overflow that cultivation is impracticable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            OTHER STREAMS.\r\n\r\nA few smaller streams are also tributary to the Colorado and Green\r\nwithin the Territory of Utah, but they mostly flow in deep cañons, are\r\noften dry in some portion of their course during every year, have at\r\nbest only a few acres of arable land anywhere along their courses, and\r\nhave been omitted in this report.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives a summary of the facts relating to the flow\r\nof the several streams and the amount of arable and irrigable lands in\r\nthe districts described above:\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------+-------------+---------+---------+\r\n  |                            | Estimated   |         |         |\r\n  |                            | volume of   | Square  |Acres of |\r\n  |                            |flow during  |miles of |irrigable|\r\n  |       Name of stream.      | irrigating  |irrigable|  land.  |\r\n  |                            |season.

Of grants for railroads, wagon roads, and canals alone,\r\nhowever, will this chapter treat, and no reference other than necessary\r\nto a proper examination of the question will be made to concessions\r\nwhose terms place the lands under specific disposal by the States, such\r\nas those for the establishment of schools, reclamation of swamp lands,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe majority of grants, therefore, coming within our notice will be\r\nthose in aid of railroads, though many have been made in favor of\r\nwagon roads and canals. The latter have, however, almost become things\r\nof the past, and are rapidly being superseded by the railway. More\r\nthan one canal has given way to the more popular and general means of\r\ntransportation, and it is safe to say that no further donations for\r\ncanal purposes will be made, unless the circumstances should be such as\r\nto absolutely demand that means of conveyance. At any rate, they will\r\nnot be made for purposes of general improvement.\r\n\r\nThe object of this chapter is to point out the origin, growth,\r\ncharacter, and extent of these concessions. It is therefore necessary\r\nto inquire into the early donations for various purposes.\r\n\r\nThe first act making a donation in favor of internal improvements was\r\napproved on the 30th of April, 1802, and was entitled “An act to enable\r\nthe people of the eastern division of the territory northwest of the\r\nriver Ohio to form a constitution and State government, and for the\r\nadmission of such State into the Union on an equal footing with the\r\noriginal States, and for other purposes.”\r\n\r\nBy the third proviso to the seventh section of that statute,\r\n“one-twentieth part of the net proceeds of the lands lying within the\r\nsaid State sold by Congress, from and after the thirtieth day of June\r\nnext, after deducting all expenses incident to the same”, was granted\r\nand given to the said State (Ohio), and was to be applied to the laying\r\nout and making of public roads leading to the Ohio River, to the said\r\nState, and through the same, from the navigable waters emptying into\r\nthe Atlantic. Such roads were to be laid out under the authority of\r\nCongress, with the consent of the several States through which they\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nBy an act approved March 3, 1803, the Secretary of the Treasury was\r\ndirected to pay, to such persons as the legislature of the State of\r\nOhio should designate, 3 per cent. of the net proceeds, as above, which\r\nsums were to be applied to laying out, opening, and making roads within\r\nsaid State.\r\n\r\nThese acts, I believe, are the first two touching public improvements\r\nthrough congressional aid. Of course there had previously been many\r\ndonations of land in favor of various persons, but they were for\r\nservices rendered the Government, or special preëmption privileges.\r\n\r\nLegislation similar to the acts above referred to, was enacted until\r\nthe year 1824, varying only in the extent of the proceeds granted.\r\n\r\nBy an act approved May 26, 1824, the State of Indiana was authorized\r\nto open and build a canal, and the right of way with 90 feet of land\r\non each side thereof, was granted, subject to use and occupancy for\r\nthe purposes specified. Nothing, however, was done under that act by\r\nthe State; and on the 2d of March, 1827, it was superseded by an act\r\nof greater extent. On that day two acts were passed giving to Indiana\r\nand Illinois, respectively, certain lands in aid of the construction of\r\ncanals, the first to connect the navigation of the Wabash River with\r\nthe waters of Lake Erie, and the second to connect the waters of the\r\nIllinois River with those of Lake Michigan. A quantity of land, equal\r\nto one-half of five sections in width on each side of said canals, was\r\ngranted, reserving to the United States each alternate section. The\r\ncanals were to remain public highways for the use of the Government,\r\nfree from toll or other charge whatever; were to be commenced in five\r\nyears, and completed in twenty years, or the States were bound to pay\r\nto the United States “the amount of any lands previously sold”, and the\r\ntitles of the purchasers under the States were to be valid.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the lines of the canals were fixed and the selections of\r\nland were made, the States had power to sell, and give fee simple title\r\nto the whole or any part of the lands.\r\n\r\nThese may, properly, be considered the initiatory concessions of lands\r\nin favor of internal improvements.\r\n\r\nAs stated, a grant for right of way had been made, but that right was\r\nsolely one of use and occupancy. In this case the right of the States\r\nto sell became absolute upon the selection of the lands. To be sure,\r\nthey were liable to repay the Government the price received by the sale\r\nof any of the lands, but the titles of their purchasers were to be in\r\n“fee”; and by such right of disposal they were enabled to realize at\r\nonce on their grant, and thereby secure a speedier construction of the\r\ncanals.\r\n\r\nOn the same day (March 2) there was also granted to Indiana a certain\r\nstrip of land formerly held by the Pottawatamie Indians, or the\r\nproceeds from the sale thereof, to be applied in building a road from\r\nLake Michigan, via Indianapolis, to some convenient point on the Ohio\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nOn the next day (March 3) an act was approved granting to Ohio one-half\r\nof two sections along the entire line of a road to be constructed from\r\nSandusky to Columbus.\r\n\r\nBy an act approved May 23, 1828, a grant of 400,000 acres of “the\r\nrelinquished lands” in certain counties in Alabama was made in aid of\r\nthe improvement of the Tennessee and other rivers in that State; and\r\nin case that amount of “said relinquished lands” could not be found\r\nunappropriated, the necessary quantity could be selected from another\r\nsection of the State. Provision was made for the sale of the lands, at\r\nthe minimum price, but in case said lands or the proceeds thereof were\r\napplied to any purposes other than that for which they were granted,\r\nthe grant was to become null and void.\r\n\r\nIn this grant we find the first provisions for indemnity if the grant\r\nwas not full by reason of prior sales or disposals by the Government.\r\nThere, if the lands were not to be found “in place”, selections “in\r\nlieu” could be made from another county.\r\n\r\nGrants like the one just referred to were made from time to time,\r\ndiffering but little in their character and extent.\r\n\r\nBy an act approved March 2, 1833, the State of Illinois was authorized\r\nto apply the lands granted by the act of March 2, 1827, for canal\r\npurposes, to the construction of a railroad instead; and the same\r\nrestrictive impositions were continued.\r\n\r\nThis is the first act looking to the construction of a railroad through\r\nthe assistance of land donations.\r\n\r\nThe railroad system was then but in its infancy, and the few miles\r\nbuilt had been constructed by private means.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to add, however, that the State did not avail itself of\r\nthe privilege granted, for it subsequently built a canal.\r\n\r\nAn act approved March 3, 1835, granted, for the purpose of aiding in\r\nthe construction of a railroad by a corporation organized in Florida,\r\nthe right of way through the public lands over which it might pass,\r\nthirty feet of land on each side of its line, and the right to take\r\nand use the timber for “one hundred yards” on each side for the\r\nconstruction and repair of said road; it was also granted “ten acres of\r\nland at the junction of the St. Mark’s and Waculla Rivers”, the point\r\nwhere said road terminated. This was the first right of way grant in\r\nfavor of railroads, the previous grant having been for a canal.\r\n\r\nFollowing this came an act approved July 2, 1836, granting the right of\r\nway “through such portion of the public lands as remain unsold”, not\r\nto exceed 80 feet in width, to the New Orleans and Nashville Railroad\r\nCompany. The first section of that statute required that a description\r\nof the route and surveys should be filed in the General Land Office\r\nwithin sixty days after the survey. The second section granted for\r\ndepots, watering-places, and workshops, essential to the convenient\r\nuse of the road, certain plats of land, not exceeding five acres in any\r\none spot, nor nearer than fifteen miles to each other.\r\n\r\nThe third section gave the company the right to take from the public\r\nlands earth, stone, or timber necessary for the construction of the\r\nroad; and provided that unless the work was commenced within two\r\nyears after the approval of the act, and completed within eight years\r\nthereafter, the grant should “cease and determine”. It provided,\r\nmoreover, that if the road should be abandoned or discontinued, even\r\nafter its completion, the grant was to “cease and determine”.\r\n\r\nSo far as can be learned, this road was never completed. It is inserted\r\nso fully for the purpose of showing the gradual growth of the system.\r\n\r\nNext to this came a grant to the East Florida and other railroads,\r\nsimilar in general terms to those previously referred to. It required,\r\nhowever, the companies to file, with the Commissioner of the General\r\nLand Office, maps showing the location of their roads. This was to\r\nbe done within six months after such locations. I am unable to find\r\nthat any of those roads were ever constructed. Certainly, no evidence\r\nthereof was ever furnished the General Land Office.\r\n\r\nA grant similar to the one to the New Orleans and Nashville company was\r\nmade by act of March 3, 1837, to the Atchafalaya Railroad and Banking\r\nCompany in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nMany grants of like character and extent were made from time to time,\r\nas also donations in favor of various other internal improvements. The\r\ngreatest of these latter, however, were the grants in aid of improving\r\nthe navigation of the Des Moines River in Iowa, and the Fox and\r\nWisconsin Rivers in Wisconsin, which were approved August 8, 1846.\r\n\r\nThe first of these made a grant to the then Territory of Iowa, for the\r\npurpose of improving “the navigation of the Des Moines River from its\r\nmouth to the Raccoon Fork (so called), in said Territory”, of “one\r\nequal moiety, in alternate sections, of the public lands (remaining\r\nunsold, and not otherwise disposed of, encumbered, or appropriated),\r\nin a strip five miles in width on each side of said river, to be\r\nselected within said Territory by an agent or agents to be appointed\r\nby the governor thereof, subject to the approval of the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury of the United States”. The second section provided that\r\n“the lands hereby granted shall not be conveyed or disposed of by said\r\nTerritory, nor by any State to be formed out of the same, except as\r\nsaid improvements shall progress; that is, the said Territory or State\r\nmay sell so much of said lands as shall produce the sum of thirty\r\nthousand dollars, and then the sales shall cease until the governor of\r\nsaid Territory or State shall certify the fact to the President of the\r\nUnited States that one-half of said sum has been expended upon said\r\nimprovement, when the said Territory or State may sell and convey a\r\nquantity of the residue of said lands sufficient to replace the amount\r\nexpended, and thus the sales shall progress as the proceeds thereof\r\nshall be expended, and the fact of such expenditure shall be certified\r\nas aforesaid.”\r\n\r\nSection 3 declared that the river should forever remain a public\r\nhighway for the use of the Government, free from toll or other charge\r\nwhatever; and provided that the Territory or State should not dispose\r\nof the lands at a price less than the minimum price of public lands.\r\n\r\nThe grant to Wisconsin for the improvement of the Fox and Wisconsin\r\nRivers, though approved the same day, was somewhat different from the\r\nDes Moines grant. It provided that “there be, and hereby is, granted\r\nto the State of Wisconsin”, upon the admission of Wisconsin as a State\r\n(which, by the way, had been provided for by an act approved two days\r\nbefore), “for the purpose of improving the navigation of the Fox and\r\nWisconsin Rivers in the Territory of Wisconsin, and of constructing the\r\ncanal to unite the said rivers, at or near the portage, a quantity of\r\nland, equal to one-half of three sections in width on each side of said\r\nFox River, and the lakes through which it passes from its mouth to the\r\npoint where the portage canal shall enter the same, and on each side\r\nof said canal from one stream to the other, reserving the alternate\r\nsections to the United States, to be selected under the direction of\r\nthe governor of said State, and such selection to be approved by the\r\nPresident of the United States”. The rivers, when improved, were to\r\nremain forever public highways for the use of the Government, free from\r\ntoll; and the sections reserved to the United States were not to be\r\nsold for less than $2.50 per acre.\r\n\r\nBy the second section, the legislature of the State was to accept the\r\ngrant and fix the price at which the lands were to be sold (at not less\r\nthan $1.25 per acre), and adopt such kind and plan of improvement as\r\nwas for the best interests of the State.\r\n\r\nThe provisions for the sale of the lands were the same as in the Iowa\r\ngrant, except that the sum to be realized by such sales was fixed at\r\n$20,000.\r\n\r\nSection 3 required the work to be commenced within three years after\r\nthe admission of the State, and to be completed within twenty years, or\r\nthe United States was to be entitled to receive the amount for which\r\nany of the lands may have been sold; the titles in the purchasers from\r\nthe State were, however, to be valid.\r\n\r\nThe language employed in this statute was more definite than that used\r\nin the Des Moines grant, and in it is to be found the first provisions\r\nrespecting the increase in price of the reserved sections.\r\n\r\nProbably no grant of this character has received such widespread\r\nnotoriety as the one for the improvement of the Des Moines River. It\r\nis owing, no doubt, in a great degree to the numerous conflicting\r\ndecisions by the Executive Departments touching the extent of the\r\ngrant. The Hon. R. J. Walker, Secretary of the Treasury (under whose\r\nsupervision the Land Office then came), decided on the 2d of March,\r\n1849, that the grant extended above the tributary of the Des Moines\r\nRiver commonly known as the Raccoon Fork. The Land Office soon\r\nthereafter passed from the jurisdiction of the Treasury Department, and\r\nwas placed as one of the bureaus of the Home or Interior Department.\r\nThe Secretary of this lately established branch of the Government\r\n(Hon. Thomas Ewing) decided on the 6th of April, 1850, that the grant\r\ndid not extend above the Raccoon Fork. From that decision the State\r\nof Iowa appealed to the President, who laid the matter before the\r\nAttorney-General. That officer (Hon. Reverdy Johnson), on July 19,\r\n1850, expressed an opinion confirmatory of the decision of Secretary\r\nWalker. The Secretary of the Interior, however, being determined in\r\nhis views, did not adopt the opinion of the Attorney-General, and the\r\nCommissioner of the General Land Office wrote, under date of 26th\r\nSeptember, 1850, to the President, reviewing and objecting to the\r\nopinion of Mr. Johnson. The President, having been again applied to by\r\nthe State of Iowa to determine the matter, referred the whole question\r\nto the Attorney-General (then Hon. J. J. Crittenden). That officer,\r\nwithout delivering an opinion on the merits of the case, expressed the\r\nbelief that the President ought not to interfere, but should leave such\r\nquestions to the proper officers. The then Secretary of the Interior\r\n(Hon. A. H. H. Stuart) thereupon decided that the grant did not extend\r\nabove the fork, but subsequently decided to approve the selections for\r\nlands above the fork. Attorney-General Cushing, on the 29th of May,\r\n1856, expressed the belief that on the merits of the case the grant\r\nwas limited to the Raccoon Fork, but as Secretary Stuart had approved\r\nselections above that point, such practical enforcement of the grant\r\nhad better be continued. The view of Mr. Cushing was subsequently\r\nmaintained by the Supreme Court of the United States in Railroad\r\nCompany _vs._ Litchfield. (23 Howard, page 66). By the act of Congress\r\napproved July 12, 1862, the grant was extended to the northern boundary\r\nof the State, so as to include the alternate odd numbered sections\r\nlying within five miles of said river, upon the following conditions:\r\nThe lands were to be held and applied in accordance with the provisions\r\nof the original grant, except that the consent of Congress was given to\r\nthe application of “a portion thereof” to aid in the construction of\r\nthe Keokuk, Fort Des Moines and Minnesota Railroad, in accordance with\r\nthe provisions of an act of the general assembly of the State approved\r\nMarch 22, 1858.\r\n\r\nIt is well to state that the work of improving the river was abandoned,\r\nand the railroad was constructed instead.\r\n\r\nWithout examining the numerous right of way and other lesser grants,\r\nI desire to direct attention to what is generally considered the\r\n_first_ railroad grant. Reference is made to the donation by the act of\r\nSeptember 20, 1850.\r\n\r\nBy that statute a grant was made to the State of Illinois of “every\r\nalternate section of land designated by even numbers, for six sections\r\nin width on each side of” the road and branches therein provided for.\r\nThe road to be built was from the southern terminus of the Illinois\r\nand Michigan Canal to a point at or near the junction of the Ohio and\r\nMississippi Rivers, with a branch of the same to Chicago, and another\r\nvia the town of Galena, in Illinois, to the town of Dubuque, in Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe second section provided that should it appear that the United\r\nStates had, when the lines of said road and branches were definitely\r\nfixed, sold any part of any section thereby granted, or that the right\r\nof preëmption had attached to the same, it should be lawful for any\r\nagent or agents (to be appointed by the governor of the State) to\r\nselect so much land as would be equal to the tracts lost within the\r\ngranted limits. This “indemnity” was to be selected within fifteen\r\nmiles of the road and branches.\r\n\r\nThe third section provided that the sections and parts of sections\r\nwhich by the operation of the grant remained to the United States\r\nwithin six miles on each side of said road and branches, should not be\r\nsold for less than the double minimum price when sold.\r\n\r\nSection 4 provided for the disposal of the lands, and declared that the\r\nroad should remain a public highway for the use of the Government free\r\nfrom toll or other charge.\r\n\r\nThe fifth section declared within what period the roads should be\r\ncompleted, and provided that in the event of a failure on the part of\r\nthe State to comply with the conditions of the grant, it was “bound to\r\npay to the United States the amount which may be received upon the sale\r\nof any part of said lands by said State”. The title of the purchasers\r\nwas to be valid, but the tracts not sold were to revert and revest in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nSection 6 said that the mails were to be transported at all times at\r\nsuch price as Congress might direct.\r\n\r\nBy the seventh section the grant was extended, on the same terms and\r\nconditions, to the States of Alabama and Mississippi, for the purpose\r\nof aiding in the construction of a road from Mobile to connect with the\r\nfirst above named road.\r\n\r\nWhile this was not the first concession of lands in favor of railroads,\r\nit may properly be considered the initiatory measure of the present\r\nsystem. It granted specific sections instead of one-half of a certain\r\nnumber of sections; provided in positive terms for “indemnity” for\r\nlands lost to the grant; designated the manner in which the lands\r\nshould be disposed of; increased the price of the reserved sections\r\nwithin the “granted” limits; provided for reversion in case of default,\r\nand virtually established a form of grant which was differed from\r\nbut little in succeeding donations. It was the first railroad grant\r\nthat became effective, for of all previous ones none appear to have\r\nbeen developed. The roads are now known as the Illinois Central and\r\nbranches, and the Mobile and Ohio.\r\n\r\nFor the following two years no grants of importance were made, until\r\nby an act approved June 10, 1852, a donation was made to the State of\r\nMissouri for the construction of certain roads therein, now known as\r\nthe Hannibal and Saint Joseph, and the Missouri Pacific, Southwest\r\nBranch. This grant was similar in character and extent to that to\r\nIllinois, save two sections--one providing for the disposal of the\r\nlands, and the other directing the Secretary of the Interior to\r\noffer at public sale, from time to time, at the increased price, the\r\n“reserved” or Government sections. The section respecting the disposal\r\nof the lands is as follows: “That the lands hereby granted to said\r\nState shall be disposed of by said State in manner following, that\r\nis to say: that a quantity of land, not exceeding one hundred and\r\ntwenty sections on each road, and included within a continuous length\r\nof twenty miles of said road, may be sold; and when the governor of\r\nsaid State shall certify to the Secretary of the Interior that said\r\ntwenty miles of road is completed, then another like quantity of land,\r\nhereby granted, may be sold; and so from time to time until said road\r\nis completed; and if said road be not completed within ten years, no\r\nfurther sales shall be made, and the lands unsold shall revert to the\r\nUnited States.”\r\n\r\nWith the exceptions stated, and the omission of the clause requiring\r\nthe State to reimburse the Government for lands sold, the grants are\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\nThat act was followed by an act approved February 9, 1853, making,\r\nunder like conditions and impositions, a similar grant to Arkansas, in\r\naid of certain roads in that State. In this, however, the clause or\r\nsection directing the Secretary to “offer” the lands was omitted.\r\n\r\nFor the next three years Congress seems to have been quite as liberal\r\nin donations for other purposes, but no grants were made in aid of\r\nrailroads, unless note be made of a grant to Minnesota by act of June\r\n29, 1854, which was repealed in August following.\r\n\r\nBy that act there was granted to the Territory of Minnesota, for the\r\npurpose of aiding in the construction of a railroad from the southern\r\nline of said Territory, via Saint Paul, to the eastern line of the\r\nTerritory in the direction of Lake Superior, “every alternate section\r\nof land designated by odd numbers for six sections in width on each\r\nside of said road within said Territory”; but in case it should appear\r\nthat the United States had, when the line of the road was definitely\r\nfixed, sold any section or any part thereof granted, or that the right\r\nof preëmption had attached to the same, then it should be lawful for\r\nany agent or agents to be appointed by the governor of said Territory,\r\nsubject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, to select\r\nlands from alternate sections within fifteen miles of the road to\r\nmake up the deficiency. The lands granted were to be applied to the\r\nconstruction of the road only. Section 2 increased the price of the\r\n“reserved” tracts.\r\n\r\nSection 3 provided that the lands should be disposed of by the\r\nlegislature for the purposes aforesaid and were not to inure to the\r\nbenefit of any company then constituted or organized. The road was to\r\nremain a highway, as in previous grants; and the lands could not be\r\nsold until they had first been “offered” at the increased price.\r\n\r\nBy section 4 no title was to vest in said Territory or patent issue\r\nfor any part of the lands until a continuous length of twenty miles of\r\nsaid road had been completed; and when the Secretary of the Interior\r\nwas satisfied that any twenty continuous miles of said road had been\r\ncompleted, then patent was to issue for a quantity not exceeding one\r\nhundred and twenty sections of land; and so on from time to time until\r\nthe road was completed. If the road was not completed within ten years\r\nno further sales could be made, and the lands remaining unsold were to\r\nrevert.\r\n\r\nBy an act approved August 4, 1854, the act of June 29, 1854, was\r\nrepealed; and although four grants have been declared forfeited, for\r\nfailure of the grantees to perform the required conditions, this is the\r\nonly one which Congress has in terms repealed.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that subsequent legislation was not as devoid of\r\nambiguity. Had it been, much embarrassment might have been saved the\r\nGovernment. I refer particularly to that clause or section respecting\r\nthe vesting of title and the manner in which the State was to acquire\r\nrights under the grant. By the terms thereof no patents were to issue\r\nexcept as the work of building the road progressed.\r\n\r\nBy the omission of such language from the grants subsequently made\r\nfrom time to time to as late as 1862, the Department of the Interior\r\nbelieved that the duty of “disposal” was properly in the States charged\r\nwith executing the trusts; and in all the earlier grants, immediately\r\nupon the location of the roads and determination of the limits of the\r\ngrants, certified, in whole, the lands to which the companies would\r\nultimately have been entitled had the roads been completed as required.\r\nAt that time there was but little doubt that all of the roads would be\r\nrapidly constructed; but the civil conflict very naturally put a stop\r\nto such extended improvements, and to-day about twenty railroads remain\r\nuncompleted, and the lands certified to the States for their use and\r\nbenefit exceed by 1,058,295.86 acres the lands actually earned by the\r\nportions of the several roads constructed.\r\n\r\nOut of the act of June 29, 1854, and the repealing statute a\r\nvery interesting question arose, which received, ultimately, the\r\nconsideration of the Supreme Court. A suit was brought in trespass by\r\nEdmund Rice against the Minnesota and Northwestern Railroad Company,\r\nfor cutting timber on a tract of land in Minnesota. The company, in\r\nits defense, set up title under the granting act aforesaid; to which\r\nplaintiff replied, reciting the repealing statute. On demurrer by\r\nthe company, the question as to whether an interest had vested under\r\nsaid grant was thus fairly presented to the Supreme Court. That body\r\ndecided, after elaborate review of the whole case, that the act of\r\nAugust 4 was “a valid law”, and that no interest, beneficiary or\r\notherwise, had vested under the said grant.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, at different times, various grants were made to the States\r\nof Iowa, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, and\r\nMississippi, and on the 3d of March, 1857, to Minnesota.\r\n\r\nAn examination of these grants--say the one to Iowa, it being first\r\nof the series--shows that, with the exception of the fact that the\r\nsections granted were designated by _odd_ instead of _even_ numbers,\r\nthey were similar to the Missouri grant of 1852. The change there\r\ninaugurated was owing to the fact that certain even sections in each\r\ntownship had been previously given to the several States for school\r\npurposes, and in a grant embracing a large territory the difference to\r\nthe railroad grants caused thereby would be considerable. From 1857\r\nuntil 1862 Congress seems to have been otherwise engaged, for I am\r\nunable to find that any acts were passed during that period touching\r\nrailroad grants.\r\n\r\nBy an act approved July 1, 1862, a new departure was taken. Certain\r\npersons were created into a body corporate under the title and name\r\nof the “Union Pacific Railroad Company”. The object thereof was the\r\nconstruction and maintenance of a railroad and telegraph line from the\r\nMissouri River to the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThey were granted the right of way through the public lands to the\r\nextent of two hundred feet in width on each side of the line of road,\r\ntogether with the necessary grounds for stations, buildings, workshops,\r\netc. They were also granted in aid of the construction of the road\r\n“every alternate section of public land”, designated by odd numbers,\r\nto the amount of five alternate sections per mile, on each side of the\r\nroad; and all lands which had been disposed of or reserved, and mineral\r\nlands, were excepted.\r\n\r\nSections 5 and 11 of the act related to the issuance of bonds by the\r\nUnited States. Section 7 required the company to file a map of its\r\ngeneral route, and directed the Secretary of the Interior to thereupon\r\nwithdraw the lands within fifteen miles of such line.\r\n\r\nVarious other roads were provided for upon the same conditions, now\r\nknown as the Central Pacific, Central Branch of the Union Pacific,\r\nKansas Pacific, and Sioux City and Pacific.\r\n\r\nAs it is not the purpose of this inquiry to look into any provisions\r\nexcept such as relate to _land_ donations, I will not pursue the\r\nsections respecting the issuance of bonds, payment of interest, etc.\r\nBut, before proceeding further, it is proper to notice the changes\r\ninaugurated by that act.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the grant was to a corporation direct, and not to a\r\nState in trust for one.\r\n\r\nSecond. It was not confined to any particular State or section, but was\r\ntranscontinental in character, extending in this case more than half\r\nacross our country.\r\n\r\nThird. It was a grant ten miles in width on each side, instead of six,\r\nas in previous grants, and no provision was made for indemnity.\r\n\r\nFourth. It provided for the filing by the company of a map of its\r\ngeneral or designated route (before definite location of its line);\r\nand upon the filing thereof the lands became legislatively reserved or\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nBy an act approved July 2, 1864, this act was amended in several\r\nparticulars, and instead of “five” sections “ten” were granted, thereby\r\nincreasing the limits from ten to twenty miles on each side of the\r\nroads. The term “mineral land” was construed not to include “coal and\r\niron land”.\r\n\r\nBy section 19 of this latter act a grant was made to the Burlington\r\nand Missouri River Railroad Company, for the construction of a road\r\nfrom the Missouri River to some point not farther west than the one\r\nhundredth meridian of west longitude to connect with the Union Pacific\r\nroad, of ten alternate sections per mile on each side of its line of\r\nroad. It has been decided that this company was not confined to any\r\nlimit, but could go far enough to secure the quantity granted, and it\r\nis the only railroad whose grant is not confined to lateral limits. By\r\na proviso to the twentieth section, however, the company received no\r\nbonds.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which the Union Pacific road was constructed was\r\nsurprising, and the whole progress of the work displayed a spirit\r\nof energy seldom seen in an undertaking of that character. The most\r\npositive achievements, however, were those of the Central Pacific\r\nCompany. The construction of that road over the Sierras is considered\r\nby professional authorities as one of the greatest results of\r\nengineering. It crossed the maximum summit, of 7,042 feet above the\r\nsea, within one hundred miles of the Pacific tide waters, requiring a\r\ndistribution of ascent really scientific to render it practicable, and,\r\nby using a minimum radius of 573 feet, secured, comparatively speaking,\r\na direct alignment.\r\n\r\nThe two roads were completed and a junction effected May 10, 1869, and\r\nthe initial transcontinental line was thereby finished.\r\n\r\nBy an act approved March 3, 1863, there was a grant made to the State\r\nof Kansas to aid in constructing certain railroads therein, now known\r\nas the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé; Leavenworth, Lawrence and\r\nGalveston, and Missouri, Kansas and Texas. It was of every alternate\r\nsection of land designated by odd numbers for ten sections in width\r\non each side of said roads. Indemnity was provided in ten additional\r\nmiles and, except as to extent, it was not unlike the Iowa grant.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of May, 1864, similar grants were made to the States of\r\nMinnesota and Wisconsin, and on the 12th of May to the State of Iowa.\r\nVarious other grants followed of like character, differing only in few\r\nrespects, to Arkansas, Alabama, Missouri, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota,\r\nand Kansas; as also grants for wagon roads. The latter were similar in\r\nterms to the railroad grants, save that three sections on either side\r\nof the roads were given instead of six or ten. The Northern Pacific was\r\ncreated July 1, 1864, and was very much like the Union Pacific grant,\r\nexcept in extent, being double the quantity through the Territories,\r\nwith provision for “indemnity”. The Atlantic and Pacific and Southern\r\nPacific grants were made by act of July 27, 1866; the Denver Pacific by\r\nact of March 3, 1869; the Southern Pacific (branch line) and Texas and\r\nPacific by act of March 3, 1871.\r\n\r\nMany of the grants made in early years were enlarged, and the time\r\nfor their completion extended; but thus far only four grants have\r\nbeen declared forfeited. At present, however, about twenty grants\r\nhave “lapsed” by reason of non-compliance with the terms of the\r\ngranting acts, requiring completion within prescribed periods, and\r\nrecommendations have been made urging proper legislation.\r\n\r\nNeither time nor space permit an extended examination of every grant,\r\nbut sufficient has been considered to point out the origin and growth\r\nof the system.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the first donation was one-twentieth part of certain\r\nproceeds derived from the sale of lands; then ninety feet of land,\r\nfollowed soon by one-half of five sections per mile on each side; then\r\nby six sections; then by ten, and finally by twenty sections per mile\r\non each side of the road.\r\n\r\nIf the lands granted, or in other words embraced within the limits of\r\nthe grants, could be found available, the companies, not including\r\nthose for canals or wagon roads, would receive, provided each built\r\nits road and complied with the laws, more than two hundred and fifteen\r\nmillion acres. That quantity if embraced in one compact body, would\r\nform an area of more than three hundred and thirty-five thousand\r\nsquare miles, or a tract of land more than seven times as large as the\r\nState of Pennsylvania, and only about six thousand miles less than the\r\narea of the thirteen original States. But, in fact, the grants will\r\nnot realize near that quantity, and the estimate, as made by the Land\r\nDepartment, is only about one hundred and eighty-seven million acres.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of those grants, however, about fifteen thousand miles\r\nof road have been constructed. Those roads have been the means of\r\ndeveloping vast fields of magnificent territory, and securing to the\r\npeople many lesser lines built by private capital.\r\n\r\nThe various grants have been the subject of much explanatory,\r\namendatory, and confirmatory legislation, and have also received\r\nnumerous interpretations by the different courts. Of the latter, I deem\r\nit proper to refer only to the more important rulings of the Supreme\r\nCourt which bear upon the fundamental principles underlying the whole\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all grants, except the Pacific, provision has been made for\r\nindemnity in case it appeared, when the lines of the roads had been\r\ndefinitely fixed, that the United States had sold, disposed of, or\r\nreserved any of the sections or parts of sections contained within the\r\ngrants. The theory has heretofore existed that “indemnity” was allowed\r\nfor all tracts which might not be found subject to the operation of the\r\ngrant; and selections have been permitted in lieu of such disposed of\r\nor reserved tracts.\r\n\r\nA recent decision, however, casts some doubt upon the correctness of\r\nthis theory. The question came up in a case from Kansas, under the act\r\nof March 3, 1863, and the court declared:\r\n\r\n“We have before said that the grant itself was _in præsenti_, and\r\ncovered all the odd sections which should appear, on the location of\r\nthe road, to have been within the grant when it was made. The right to\r\nthem did not, however, depend on such location, but attached at once\r\non the making of the grant. It is true they could not be identified\r\nuntil the line of the road was marked out on the ground, but as soon as\r\nthis was done it was easy to find them. If the company did not obtain\r\nall of them within the original limit, by reason of the power of sale\r\nor reservation retained by the United States, it was to be compensated\r\nby an equal amount of substituted lands. The latter could not, on any\r\ncontingency, be selected within that limit. * * * It would be strange,\r\nindeed, if the [indemnity] clause had been intended to perform the\r\noffice of making a new grant within the ten mile limit, or enlarging\r\nthe one already made. Instead of this, the words employed show clearly\r\nthat its only purpose is to give sections beyond that limit for those\r\nlost within it by the action of the government between the date of the\r\ngrant and the location of the road. This construction gives effect to\r\nthe whole statute, and makes each part consistent with the other.”\r\n\r\nIf it be thought, however, that such was not the intention of the\r\nlegislators who framed the statutes, consolation can be found in the\r\nconstruction given to the clause inserted in every grant, substantially\r\nas follows: “And the said road shall remain a public highway for\r\nthe use of the Government, free from toll or other charge upon the\r\ntransportation of troops or other property of the United States.”\r\n\r\nIt is declared by the Supreme Court that the purpose of that clause\r\nwas to allow the Government the right to place its locomotive engines\r\nand cars upon the railroad tracks, and to use such tracks as a public\r\nhighway. The court say: “We are of opinion that the reservation in\r\nquestion secures to the Government only a free use of the railroads\r\nconcerned; and that it does not entitle the Government to have troops\r\nor property transported by the companies over their respective roads\r\nfree of charge for transporting the same.”\r\n\r\nThe section providing for the disposal of the lands, recited in full in\r\nthe Missouri grant of 1852, has been construed as vesting in the State\r\nthe right to sell one hundred and twenty sections of land, contained\r\nwithin a continuous length of twenty miles at any place along the\r\ngrant, even though the road contemplated was never built; and the title\r\nacquired by purchase from the State is valid. And the clause with which\r\nthe section referred to ends, to the effect that if the road be not\r\ncompleted within a certain time the lands shall revert to the United\r\nStates, has been declared inoperative without further action by the\r\nGovernment, either legislative or judicial, looking to an enforcement\r\nof the reserved right.\r\n\r\nFears have been awakened as to the power to ultimately control these\r\ncorporations, on account of the enormous extent to which they have\r\nexpanded; but, as has been said by an able writer, “this evil, however,\r\nif it be such, will probably work its own cure.”\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, their influences have been felt by all, and their\r\nbenefits have extended to the remotest sections of our country. They\r\nhave proved a bond between the eastern and western States--anxiously\r\nsought for by Washington when the lateral limits of the United States\r\nwere less than half what they are at this time. They have united the\r\nPacific with the Atlantic, and the Rocky Mountains of the west with\r\nthe Alleghanies of the east. They have dispelled all ideas looking to\r\nthe removal of the seat of Government, for they have put in direct\r\ncommunication the people of Oregon with the people of Maine. From ocean\r\nto ocean requires but days, where only a few years ago it required\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nIn the past, long lines of moving wagons groaned beneath their loads\r\nof adventurous families, who at night, within the corral, seated\r\nthemselves around the blazing camp fire, fearful of the dangers to\r\nwhich they were exposed. But the present has forgotten them. In their\r\nstead the ponderous wheels of frequent trains, moving with a speed\r\nsurpassing that of the deer, traversing the valley and mountain, carry\r\nforward their loads of living freight; and, in place of dangerous\r\nencampments, provide means of sleep and refreshment, and afford the\r\ncomforts of luxurious homes. The railway has brought to our doors the\r\nharvest of our fields; handed to our mints the vast resources of our\r\nmines, and opened to us direct communication with the older worlds. Its\r\narms have extended into a hundred vales and over a hundred mountains,\r\ngrasping in their embrace manifold evidences of civilization and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   Page.\r\n\r\n  Abbott, Mr., 62\r\n\r\n  _Abies amabilis_, 102\r\n    _Canadensis_, 100\r\n    _concolor_, 101\r\n    _Douglasii_, 100\r\n    _Engelmanni_, 101\r\n    _grandis_, 102\r\n    _Menziesii_, 101\r\n    _subalpina_, 101\r\n\r\n  _Acer grandidentata_, 103\r\n\r\n  Agricultural and timber industries differentiated, 18\r\n    resources of the Bear River drainage basin, 119\r\n      Jordan River drainage basin, 124\r\n      Weber River drainage basin, 121\r\n\r\n  Agriculture, Amount of precipitation necessary for, 2, 3\r\n    Influence of temperature upon, 2\r\n    in the Arid Region dependent upon irrigation, 40\r\n    in Utah dependent upon irrigation, 6\r\n      exceptions thereto, 6\r\n    limited by several conditions, 7\r\n    Utilization of the small streams in, 7\r\n    without irrigation, 3, 6, 50\r\n\r\n  _Aira cœspitosa_, 109\r\n\r\n  Alabama, Land-grants to, 179\r\n\r\n  Alkaline salts, 145\r\n\r\n  Amount of land a unit of water will supply, 7\r\n\r\n  Antelope Island, 63, 64\r\n    bar, 63, 67\r\n\r\n  Areal distribution of rainfall, 82\r\n\r\n  Area of irrigable land sometimes not limited by water supply, 85\r\n\r\n  Areas of standing timber, 15\r\n    to which larger streams can be taken, 7\r\n    which smaller streams can serve, 7\r\n\r\n  Arid Region, Boundaries of the, 1, 3\r\n    Extent of the, 5\r\n    Increase in water supply in the, 89, 91\r\n    Land system needed for the, 25\r\n    Mining industries of the, 88\r\n    Physical characteristics of the, 1\r\n    Precipitation of the, 48\r\n    Rainfall of the, 5\r\n\r\n  Arizona and New Mexico, Seasonal precipitation in, 56\r\n\r\n  Arkansas, Land grants to, 174, 179\r\n\r\n  _Artemisia_, 110\r\n\r\n  Ashley Fork, Irrigable lands of, 161\r\n\r\n  Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fé Railroad Company, Land grants to the,\r\n   178\r\n\r\n  Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company, Land grants to the, 179\r\n\r\n  Atlantic coast, Flow of the rivers of the, 76\r\n    Rainfall on the, 69\r\n\r\n\r\n  Barfoot, Mr. J.
