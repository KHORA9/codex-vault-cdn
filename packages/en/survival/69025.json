The more densely populated European\r\ncountries were forced to adopt filtration many years ago, to prevent\r\nthe evils arising from the unavoidable contaminations of the rivers\r\nand lakes which were the only available sources for their public\r\nwater-supplies; and it has been found to answer its purpose so well\r\nthat at the present time cities in Europe nearly if not quite equal in\r\npopulation to all the cities of the United States are supplied with\r\nfiltered water.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, when the whole subject of water-supply was still\r\ncomparatively new in this country, filtration was considered as a means\r\nfor rendering the waters of our rivers suitable for the purpose of\r\ndomestic water-supply. St. Louis investigated this subject in 1866,\r\nand the engineer of the St. Louis Water Board, the late Mr. J. P.\r\nKirkwood, made an investigation and report upon European methods of\r\nfiltration which was published in 1869, and was such a model of full\r\nand accurate statement combined with clearly-drawn conclusions that, up\r\nto the present time, it has remained the only treatise upon the subject\r\nin English, notwithstanding the great advances which have been made,\r\nparticularly in the last ten years, with the aid of knowledge of the\r\nbacteria and the germs of certain diseases in water.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the interest in the subject was not maintained in\r\nAmerica, but was allowed to lag for many years; it was cheaper to use\r\nthe water in its raw state than it was to purify it; the people became\r\nindifferent to the danger of such use, and the disastrous epidemics\r\nof cholera and typhoid fever, as well as of minor diseases, which so\r\noften resulted from the use of polluted water, were attributed to other\r\ncauses. With increasing study and diffusion of knowledge the relations\r\nof water and disease are becoming better known, and the present state\r\nof things will not be allowed to continue; indeed at present there is\r\ninquiry at every hand as to the methods of improving waters.\r\n\r\nThe one unfortunate feature is the question of cost. Not that the cost\r\nof filtration is excessive or beyond the means of American communities;\r\nin point of fact, exactly the reverse is the case; but we have been so\r\nlong accustomed to obtain drinking-water without expense other than\r\npumping that any cost tending to improved quality seems excessive, thus\r\naffording a chance for the installation of inferior filters, which by\r\nfailing to produce the promised results tend to bring the whole process\r\ninto disrepute, since few people can distinguish between an adequate\r\nfiltration and a poor substitute for it. It is undoubtedly true that\r\nimprovements are made, and will continue to be made, in processes of\r\nfiltration; so it will often be possible to reduce the expense of the\r\nprocess without decreasing the efficiency, but great care must be\r\nexercised in such cases to maintain the conditions really essential to\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nIn the present volume I have endeavored to explain briefly the nature\r\nof filtration and the conditions which, in half a century of European\r\npractice, have been found essential for successful practice, with a\r\nview of stimulating interest in the subject, and of preventing the\r\nunfortunate and disappointing results which so easily result from the\r\nconstruction of inferior filters. The economies which may possibly\r\nresult by the use of an inferior filtration are comparatively small,\r\nand it is believed that in those American cities where filtration is\r\nnecessary or desirable it will be found best in every case to furnish\r\nfilters of the best construction, fully able to do what is required of\r\nthem with ease and certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been several distinct epochs in the development of water\r\npurification in the United States. The first may be said to date\r\nfrom Kirkwood’s report on the “Filtration of River Waters,” and the\r\nsecond from the inauguration of the Lawrence Experiment Station by\r\nthe Massachusetts State Board of Health, and the construction of\r\nthe Lawrence city filter, with the demonstration of the wonderful\r\nbiological action of filters upon highly polluted waters.\r\n\r\nThe third epoch is marked by the experiments at Louisville, Pittsburg\r\nand Cincinnati, which have greatly increased our knowledge of the\r\ntreatment of waters containing enormous quantities of suspended matter,\r\nand have reduced to something like order the previously existing\r\nconfused mass of data regarding coagulation and rapid filtration.\r\n\r\nThe first edition of this book represented the earlier epochs\r\nbefore the opening of the third. In the five years since it was\r\nwritten, progress in the art of water purification has been rapid\r\nand substantial. No apology is needed for the very complete revision\r\nrequired to treat these newly investigated subjects as fully as were\r\nother matters in the earlier editions.\r\n\r\nIn the present edition the first seven chapters remain with but few\r\nadditions. Experience has strengthened the propositions contained\r\nin them. New data might have been added, but in few cases would the\r\nconclusions have been altered. The remaining chapters of the book have\r\nbeen entirely rewritten and enlarged to represent the added information\r\nnow available, so that the present edition is nearly twice as large as\r\nthe earlier ones. In the appendices, also, much matter has been added\r\nrelating to works in operation, particularly to those in America.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK January, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   PAGE\r\n\r\n  Chapter  I.

England has secured a whole series of magnificent supplies\r\nby impounding the waters of small streams in reservoirs holding enough\r\nwater to last through dry periods, while on Continental Europe such\r\nsupplies are hardly known. Germany has spent millions upon millions in\r\npurifying turbid and polluted river-waters, while France and Austria\r\nhave striven for mountain-spring waters and have built hundreds of\r\nmiles of costly aqueducts to secure them. In the United States an\r\nabundant supply of some liquid has too often been the objective point,\r\nand the efforts have been most successful, the American works being\r\nentirely unrivalled in the volumes of their supplies. I do not wish\r\nto imply that quality has been entirely neglected in our country, for\r\nmany cities and towns have seriously and successfully studied their\r\nproblems, with the result that there are hundreds of water-supplies\r\nin the United States which will compare favorably upon any basis with\r\nsupplies in any part of the world; but on the other hand it is equally\r\ntrue that there are hundreds of other cities, including some among\r\nthe largest in the country, which supply their citizens with turbid\r\nand unhealthy waters which cannot be regarded as anything else than a\r\nnational disgrace and a menace to our prosperity.\r\n\r\nOne can travel through England, Belgium, Holland, Germany, and large\r\nportions of other European countries and drink the water at every city\r\nvisited without anxiety as to its effect upon his health. It has not\r\nalways been so. Formerly European capitals drank water no better than\r\nthat so often dispensed now in America. As recently as 1892 Germany’s\r\ngreat commercial centre, Hamburg, having a water-supply essentially\r\nlike those of Philadelphia, Pittsburg, Cincinnati, St. Louis, New\r\nOrleans, and a hundred other American cities, paid a penalty in one\r\nmonth of eight thousand lives for its carelessness. The lesson was a\r\ndear one, but it was not wasted. Hamburg now has a new and wholesome\r\nsupply, and other German cities the qualities of whose waters were open\r\nto question have been forced to take active measures to better their\r\nconditions. We also can learn something from their experience.\r\n\r\nThere are three principal methods of securing a good water-supply for a\r\nlarge city. The first consists of damming a stream from an uninhabited\r\nor but sparsely inhabited watershed, thus forming an impounding\r\nreservoir. This method is extensively used in England and in the United\r\nStates. In the latter most of the really good and large supplies are so\r\nobtained. It is only applicable to places having suitable watersheds\r\nwithin a reasonable distance, and there are large regions where, owing\r\nto geological and other conditions, it cannot be applied. It is most\r\nuseful in hilly and poor farming countries, as in parts of England and\r\nWales, in the Atlantic States, and in California. It cannot be used to\r\nany considerable extent in level and fertile countries which are sure\r\nto be or to become densely populated, as is the case with large parts\r\nof France and Germany and in the Middle States.\r\n\r\nThe second method is to secure ground-water, that is, spring or well\r\nwater, which by its passage through the ground has become thoroughly\r\npurified from any impurities which it may have contained. This was the\r\nearliest and is the most widely used method of securing good water.\r\nIt is specially adapted to small supplies. Under favorable geological\r\nconditions very large supplies have been obtained in this manner. In\r\nEurope Paris, Vienna, Budapest, Munich, Cologne, Leipzig, Dresden, a\r\npart of London, and very many smaller places are so supplied. This\r\nmethod is also extensively used in the United States for small and\r\nmedium-sized places, and deserves to be most carefully studied, and\r\nused whenever possible, but is unfortunately limited by geological\r\nconditions and cannot be used except in a fraction of the cases where\r\nsupplies are required. No ground-water supplies yet developed in the\r\nUnited States are comparable in size to those used in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe third process of securing a good water-supply is by means of\r\nfiltration of surface waters which would otherwise be unsuitable for\r\ndomestic purposes. The methods of filtration, which it is the purpose\r\nof this volume to explain, are beyond the experimental stage; they\r\nare now applied to the purification of the water-supplies of European\r\ncities with an aggregate population of at least 20,000,000 people. In\r\nthe United States the use of filters is much less common, and most of\r\nthe filters in use are of comparatively recent installation.\r\n\r\nGreat interest has been shown in the subject during the last few\r\nyears, and the peculiar character of some American waters, which differ\r\nwidely in their properties from those of many European streams, has\r\nreceived careful and exhaustive consideration. In Europe filtration has\r\nbeen practised with continually improving methods since 1829, and the\r\nprocess has steadily received wider and wider application. It has been\r\nmost searchingly investigated in its hygienic relations, and has been\r\nrepeatedly found to be a most valuable aid in reducing mortality. The\r\nconditions under which satisfactory results can be obtained are now\r\ntolerably well known, so that filters can be built in the United States\r\nwith the utmost confidence that the result will not be disappointing.\r\n\r\nThe cost of filtration, although considerable, is not so great as to\r\nput it beyond the reach of American cities. It may be roughly estimated\r\nthat the cost of filtration, with all necessary interest and sinking\r\nfunds, will add 10 per cent to the average cost of water as at present\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nIt may be confidently expected that when the facts are better\r\nunderstood and realized by the American public, we shall abandon the\r\npresent filthy and unhealthy habit of drinking polluted river and\r\nlake waters, and shall put the quality as well as the quantity of our\r\nsupplies upon a level not exceeded by those of any country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCONTINUOUS FILTERS AND THEIR CONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFiltration of water consists in passing it through some substance\r\nwhich retains or removes some of its impurities. In its simplest form\r\nfiltration is a straining process, and the results obtained depend upon\r\nthe fineness of the strainer, and this in turn is regulated by the\r\ncharacter of the water and the uses to which it is to be put. Thus in\r\nthe manufacture of paper an enormous volume of water is required free\r\nfrom particles which, if they should become imbedded in the paper,\r\nwould injure its appearance or texture. Obviously for this purpose the\r\nremoval of the smaller particles separately invisible to the unaided\r\neye, and thus not affecting the appearance of the paper, and the\r\nremoval of which would require the use of a finer filter at increased\r\nexpense, would be a simple waste of money. When, however, a water is\r\nto be used for a domestic water supply and transparency is an object,\r\nthe still finer particles which would not show themselves in paper, but\r\nwhich are still able, in bulk, to render a water turbid, should be as\r\nfar as possible removed, thus necessitating a finer filter; and, when\r\nthere is reason to think that the water contains the germs of disease,\r\nthe filter must be fine enough to remove with certainty those organisms\r\nso extraordinarily small that millions of them may exist in a glass of\r\nwater without imparting a visible turbidity.\r\n\r\nIt is now something over half a century since the first successful\r\nattempts were made to filter public water-supplies, and there are\r\nnow hundreds of cities supplied with clear, healthy, filtered water.\r\n(Appendix IV.) While the details of the filters used in different\r\nplaces present considerable variations, the general form is, in\r\nEurope at least, everywhere the same. The most important parts of a\r\nfilter are shown by the accompanying sketch, in which the dimensions\r\nare much exaggerated. The raw water is taken from the river into a\r\nsettling-basin, where the heaviest mud is allowed to settle. In the\r\ncase of lake and pond waters the settling-tank is dispensed with, but\r\nit is essential for turbid river-water, as otherwise the mud clogs\r\nthe filter too rapidly. The partially clarified water then passes to\r\nthe filter, which consists of a horizontal layer of rather fine sand\r\nsupported by gravel and underdrained, the whole being enclosed in a\r\nsuitable basin or tank. The water in passing through the sand leaves\r\nbehind upon the sand grains the extremely small particles which were\r\ntoo fine to settle out in the settling-basin, and is quite clear as it\r\ngoes from the gravel to the drains and the pumps, which forward it to\r\nthe reservoir or city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—SKETCH SHOWING GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF FILTER\r\nPLANTS.]\r\n\r\nThe passages between the grains of sand through which the water must\r\npass are extremely small. If the sand grains were spherical and 1/50 of\r\nan inch in diameter, the openings would only allow the passage of other\r\nspheres 1/320 of an inch in diameter, and with actual irregular sands\r\nmuch finer particles are held back. As a result the coarser matters\r\nin the water are retained on the surface of the sand, where they\r\nquickly form a layer of sediment, which itself becomes a filter much\r\nfiner than the sand alone, and which is capable of holding back under\r\nsuitable conditions even the bacteria of the passing water. The water\r\nwhich passes before this takes place may be less perfectly filtered,\r\nbut even then, the filter may be so operated that nearly all of the\r\nbacteria will be deposited in the sand and not allowed to pass through\r\ninto the effluent.\r\n\r\nAs the sediment layer increases in thickness with continued filtration,\r\nincreased pressure is required to drive the desired volume of water\r\nthrough its pores, which are ever becoming smaller and reduced in\r\nnumber. When the required quantity of water will no longer pass with\r\nthe maximum pressure allowed, it is necessary to remove, by scraping,\r\nthe sediment layer, which should not be more than an inch deep. This\r\nlayer contains most of the sediment, and the remaining sand will then\r\nact almost as new sand would do. The sand removed may be washed for use\r\nagain, and eventually replaced when the sand layer becomes too thin\r\nby repeated scrapings. These operations require that the filter shall\r\nbe temporarily out of use, and as water must in general be supplied\r\nwithout intermission, a number of filters are built together, so that\r\nany of them can be shut out without interfering with the action of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of filters in relation to the pumps varies with local\r\nconditions. With gravity supplies the filters are usually located below\r\nthe storage reservoir, and, properly placed, involve only a few feet\r\nloss of head.\r\n\r\nIn the case of tidal rivers, as at Antwerp and Rotterdam, the quality\r\nof the raw water varies with the tide, and there is a great advantage\r\nin having the settling-basins low enough so that a whole day’s supply\r\ncan be rapidly let in when the water is at its best, without pumping.\r\nAt Antwerp the filters are higher, and the water is pumped from the\r\nsettling basins to them, and again from the reservoir receiving the\r\neffluents from the filters to the city. In several of the London\r\nworks (East London, Grand Junction, Southwark and Vauxhall, etc.) the\r\nsettling-basins are lower than the river, and the filters are still\r\nlower, so that a single pumping suffices, that coming between the\r\nfilter and the city, or elevated distributing reservoir.\r\n\r\nIn many other English filters and in most German works the\r\nsettling-basins and filters are placed together a little higher than\r\nthe river, thus avoiding at once trouble from floods and cost for\r\nexcavation. The water requires to be pumped twice, once before and once\r\nafter filtration. At Altona the settling-basins and filters are placed\r\nupon a hill, to which the raw Elbe water is pumped, and from which it\r\nis supplied to the city after filtration by gravity without further\r\npumping. The location of the works in this case is said to have been\r\ndetermined by the location of a bed of sand suitable for filtration on\r\nthe spot where the filters were built.\r\n\r\nWhen two pumpings are required they are frequently done, especially in\r\nthe smaller places, in the same pumping-station, with but one set of\r\nboilers and engines, the two pumps being connected to the same engine.\r\nThe cost is said to be only slightly greater than that of a single\r\nlift of the same total height. In very large works, as at Berlin and\r\nHamburg and some of the London companies, two separate sets of pumping\r\nmachinery involve less extra cost relatively than would be the case\r\nwith smaller works.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEDIMENTATION-BASINS.\r\n\r\nKirkwood[2] found in 1866 that sedimentation-basins were essential\r\nto the successful treatment of turbid river-waters, and subsequent\r\nexperience has not in any way shaken his conclusion. The German works\r\nvisited by him, Berlin (Stralau) and Altona, were both built by English\r\nengineers, and their settling-basins did not differ materially from\r\nthose of corresponding works in England. Since that time, however,\r\nthere has been a well-marked tendency on the part of the German\r\nengineers to use smaller, while the English engineers have used much\r\nlarger sedimentation-basins, so that the practices of the two countries\r\nare now widely separated, the difference no doubt being in part at\r\nleast due to local causes.\r\n\r\nKirkwood found sedimentation-basins at Altona with a capacity of\r\n2-1/4 times the daily supply. In 1894 the same basins were in use,\r\nalthough the filtering area had been increased from 0.82 acre to 2.20\r\nacres, and still more filters were in course of construction, and\r\nthe average daily quantity of water had increased from 600,000 to\r\n4,150,000 gallons in 1891-2, or more than three times the capacity of\r\nthe sedimentation-basins. In 1890 the depth of mud deposited in these\r\nbasins was reported to be two feet deep in three months. At Stralau in\r\nBerlin, also, in the same time the filtering area was nearly doubled\r\nwithout increasing the size of the sedimentation-basins, but the Spree\r\nat this point has such a slow current that it forms itself a natural\r\nsedimentation-basin. At Magdeburg on the Elbe works were built in 1876\r\nwith a filtering area of 1.92 acres, and a sedimentation-basin capacity\r\nof 11,300,000 gallons, but in 1894 half of the latter had been built\r\nover into filters, which with two other filters gave a total filtering\r\nsurface of 3.90 acres, with a sedimentation-basin capacity of only\r\n5,650,000 gallons. The daily quantity of water pumped for 1891-2 was\r\n5,000,000 gallons, so that the present sedimentation-basin capacity is\r\nabout equal to one day’s supply, or relatively less than a third of the\r\noriginal provision. The idea followed is that most of the particles\r\nwhich will settle at all will do so within twenty-four hours, and that\r\na greater storage capacity may allow the growth of algæ, and that the\r\nwater may deteriorate rather than improve in larger tanks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAVED EMBANKMENT BETWEEN TWO FILTERS, EAST LONDON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FILTERS AND CHANNELS FOR RAW WATER, ANTWERP.]\r\n\r\n  [_To face page 10._]\r\n\r\nAt London, on the other hand, the authorities consider a large storage\r\ncapacity for unfiltered water as one of the most important conditions\r\nof successful filtration, the object however, being perhaps as much to\r\nsecure storage as to allow sedimentation. In 1893 thirty-nine places\r\nwere reported upon the Thames and the Lea which were giving their\r\nsewage systematic treatment before discharging it into the streams\r\nfrom which London’s water is drawn. These sewage treatments are, with\r\nhardly an exception, dry-weather treatments, and as soon as there is\r\na considerable storm crude sewage is discharged into the rivers at\r\nevery point. The rivers are both short, and are quickly flooded, and\r\nafterwards are soon back in their usual condition. At these times of\r\nflood, the raw water is both very turbid and more polluted by sewage\r\nthan at other times, and it is the aim of the authorities to have the\r\nwater companies provide reservoir capacity enough to carry them through\r\ntimes of flood without drawing any water whatever from the rivers. This\r\nobviously involves much more extensive reservoirs than those used in\r\nGermany, and the companies actually have large basins and are still\r\nadding to them. The storage capacities of the various companies vary\r\nfrom 3 to 18 times the respective average daily supplies, and together\r\nequal 9 times the total supply.\r\n\r\nIn case the raw water is taken from a lake or a river at a point where\r\nthere is but little current, as in a natural or artificial pond,\r\nsedimentation-basins are unnecessary. This is the case at Zürich (lake\r\nwater), at Berlin when the rivers Havel and Spree spread into lakes, at\r\nTegel and Müggel, and at numerous other works.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE OF FILTER-BEDS.\r\n\r\nThe total area of filters required in any case is calculated from the\r\nquantity of water required, the rate of filtration, and an allowance\r\nfor filters out of use while being cleaned. To prevent interruptions\r\nof the supply at times of cleaning, the filtering area is divided into\r\nbeds which are operated separately, the number and size of the beds\r\ndepending upon local conditions. The cost per acre is decreased with\r\nlarge beds on account of there being less wall or embankment required,\r\nwhile, on the other hand, the convenience of operation may suffer,\r\nespecially in small works. It is also frequently urged that with large\r\nfilters it is difficult or impossible to get an even rate of filtration\r\nover the entire area owing to the frictional resistance of the\r\nunderdrains for the more distant parts of the filter. A discussion of\r\nthis point is given in Chapter III, page 41. At Hamburg, where the size\r\nof the single beds, 1.88 acres each, is larger than at any other place,\r\nit is shown that there is no serious cause for anxiety; and even if\r\nthere were, the objectionable resistance could be still farther reduced\r\nby a few changes in the under-drains. The sizes of filter-beds used at\r\na large number of places are given in Appendix IV.\r\n\r\nAt a number of places having severe winters, filters are vaulted over\r\nas a protection from cold, and in the most important of these, Berlin,\r\nWarsaw, and St. Petersburg, the areas of the single beds are nearly\r\nthe same, namely, from 0.52 to 0.59 acre. The works with open filters\r\nat London (seven companies), Amsterdam, and Breslau have filter-beds\r\nfrom 0.82 to 1.50 acres each. Liverpool and Hamburg alone use filters\r\nwith somewhat larger areas. Large numbers of works with both covered\r\nand open filters have much smaller beds than these sizes, but generally\r\nthis is to avoid too small a number of divisions in a small total area,\r\nalthough such works have sometimes been extended with the growth of the\r\ncities until they now have a considerable number of very small basins.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORM OF FILTER-BEDS.\r\n\r\nThe form and construction of the filter-beds depend upon local\r\nconditions, the foundations, and building materials available, the\r\nprinciples governing these points being in general the same as for the\r\nconstruction of ordinary reservoirs. The bottoms require to be made\r\nwater-tight, either by a thin layer of concrete or by a pavement upon\r\na puddle layer. For the sides either masonry walls or embankments are\r\nused, the former saving space, but being in general more expensive in\r\nconstruction. Embankments must, of course, be substantially paved near\r\nthe water-line to withstand the action of ice, and must not be injured\r\nby rapid fluctuations in the water-levels in the filters.\r\n\r\nFailure to make the bottoms water-tight has perhaps caused more\r\nannoyance than any other single point. With a leaky bottom there\r\nis either a loss of water when the water in the filters is higher\r\nthan the ground-water, or under reverse conditions, the ground-water\r\ncomes in and mixes with the filtered water, and the latter is rarely\r\nimproved and may be seriously damaged by the admixture. And with very\r\nbad conditions water may pass from one filter to another, with the\r\ndifferences in pressure always existing in neighboring filters, with\r\nmost unsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOVERS FOR FILTERS.\r\n\r\nThe filters in England and Holland are built open, without protection\r\nfrom the weather. In Germany the filters first built were also open,\r\nbut in the colder climates more or less difficulty was experienced\r\nin keeping the filters in operation in cold weather. An addition to\r\nthe Berlin filters, built in 1874, was covered with masonry vaulting,\r\nover which several feet of earth were placed, affording a complete\r\nprotection against frost. The filters at Magdeburg built two years\r\nlater were covered in the same way, and since that time covered filters\r\nhave been built at perhaps a dozen different places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR VIEW OF COVERED FILTER, ASHLAND, WIS.\r\n\r\nWhen in use the water rises nearly to the springing line of the arches.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COVERED FILTER IN COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION, SHOWING WOODEN\r\nCENTERS FOR MASONRY VAULTING, SOMERSWORTH, N. H.]\r\n\r\n  [_To face page 12._]\r\n\r\nIt was found at Berlin that, owing to the difficulty of properly\r\ncleaning the open filters in winter, it was impossible to keep the\r\nusual proportion of the area in effective service, and as a result\r\nportions of the filters were greatly overtaxed during prolonged\r\nperiods of cold weather. This resulted in greatly decreased bacterial\r\nefficiency, the bacteria in March, 1889, reaching 3000 to 4000 per\r\ncc. (with 100,000 in the raw water), although ordinarily the effluent\r\ncontained less than 100. An epidemic of typhoid fever followed, and was\r\nconfined to that part of the city supplied from the Stralau works,\r\nthe wards supplied from the covered Tegel filters remaining free from\r\nfever. Open filters have since been abandoned in Berlin.\r\n\r\nAt Altona also, where the water is taken from an excessively polluted\r\nsource, decreased bacterial efficiency has repeatedly resulted in\r\nwinter, and the occasional epidemics of typhoid fever in that city,\r\nwhich have invariably come in winter, appear to have been directly due\r\nto the effect of cold upon the open filters. The city has just extended\r\nthe open filters, and hopes with an increased reserve area to avoid\r\nthe difficulty in future without resource to covered filters. (See\r\nAppendices II and VII.)\r\n\r\nBrunswick, Lübeck, and Frankfort on Oder with cold winters have open\r\nfilters, but draw their water-supplies from less polluted sources, and\r\nhave thus far escaped the fate of Berlin and Altona. The new filters\r\nat Hamburg also are open. At Zürich, where open and covered filters\r\nwere long used side by side, the covered filters were much more\r\nsatisfactory, and the old open filters have recently been vaulted over.\r\n\r\nKönigsberg originally built open filters, but was afterward obliged to\r\ncover them, on account of the severe winters; and at Breslau, where\r\nopen filters have long been used, the recent additions are vaulted over.\r\n\r\nThe fact that inferior efficiency of filtration results with open\r\nfilters during prolonged and severe winter weather is generally\r\nadmitted, although there is some doubt as to the exact way in which\r\nthe disturbance is caused. In some works I am informed that in cutting\r\nthe ice around the edges of the filter and repeatedly piling the\r\nloose pieces upon the floating cake, the latter eventually becomes so\r\nthickened at the sides that the projecting lower corners actually touch\r\nthe sand, with the fluctuating levels which often prevail in these\r\nworks, and that in this way the sediment layer upon the top of the sand\r\nis broken and the water rapidly passes without adequate purification at\r\nthe points of disturbance.\r\n\r\nThis theory is, however, inadequate to account for many cases where\r\nsuch an accumulation of ice is not allowed. In these cases the poor\r\nwork is not obtained until after the filters have been scraped. The\r\nsand apparently freezes slightly while the water is off, and when water\r\nis brought back and filtration resumed, normal results are for some\r\nreason not again obtained for a time.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the poorer work from open filters in cold weather, the\r\ncost of removing the ice adds materially to the operating expenses, and\r\nin very cold climates would in itself make covers advisable.\r\n\r\nI have arranged the European filter plants, in regard to which I have\r\nsufficient information, in the table on page 15, in the order of the\r\nnormal mean January temperatures of the respective places. This may not\r\nbe an ideal criterion of the necessity of covering filters, but it is\r\nat least approximate, and in the absence of more detailed comparisons\r\nit will serve to give a good general idea of the case. I have not\r\nfound a single case where covered filters are used where the January\r\ntemperature is 32° F. or above. In some of these places some trouble is\r\nexperienced in unusually cold weather, but I have not heard of any very\r\nserious difficulty or of any talk of covering filters at these places\r\nexcept at Rotterdam, where a project for covering was being discussed.\r\n\r\nThose places having January temperatures below 30° experience a great\r\ndeal of difficulty with open filters; so much so, that covered filters\r\nmay be regarded as necessary for them, although it is possible to keep\r\nopen filters running with decreased efficiency and increased expense by\r\nfreely removing the ice, with January temperatures some degrees lower.\r\n\r\nWhere the mean January temperature is 30° to 32° F. there is room for\r\ndoubt as to the necessity of covering filters, but, judging from the\r\nexperience of Berlin and Altona, the covered filters are much safer at\r\nthis temperature.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF PLACES HAVING OPEN AND COVERED FILTERS.\r\n\r\nARRANGED ACCORDING TO THE MEAN JANUARY TEMPERATURES.\r\n\r\n  ------------+------------------+--------------------------------------\r\n  Normal Mean |                  |\r\n  January     |  Place.          | Kind of Filters and Results.\r\n  Temperature.|                  |\r\n  Degrees F.  |                  |\r\n  ------------+------------------+--------------------------------------\r\n      37-40°  |All English cities|Open filters only are used, and no\r\n              |                  |  great difficulty with ice is\r\n              |                  |  experienced.\r\n      33-35°  |Cities in Holland |All filters are open, and there is\r\n              |                  |  little serious trouble with ice;\r\n              |                  |  but at Amsterdam and Rotterdam\r\n              |                  |  the bacteria in effluents are said\r\n              |                  |  to be higher in winter than at\r\n              |                  |  other times.\r\n      32°     |   Bremen         |Open filters.\r\n      31°     |   Altona         |Much difficulty with ice in open\r\n              |                  |  filters (see Appendices II and VII).\r\n      31°     |  Brunswick       |Open filters.\r\n      31°     |  Hamburg         |Open filters.\r\n      31°     |  Lübeck          |Open filters.\r\n      31°     |  Berlin          |Open filters were formerly used, but\r\n              |                  |  owing to decreased efficiency in\r\n              |                  |  cold weather they have been\r\n              |                  |  abandoned for covered ones.\r\n      31°     | Magdeburg        |Covered filters, but a recent addition\r\n              |                  |  is not covered.\r\n      30°     |Frankfort on Oder |Open filters.\r\n      30°     | Stuttgart        |Part of the filters are covered.\r\n      30°     |  Stettin         |Part of the filters are covered.\r\n      29°     |  Zürich          |Covered filters were much the most\r\n              |                  |  satisfactory, and the open ones were\r\n              |                  |  covered in 1894.

Small holes for the admission of air and light\r\nare usually left at intervals. The thickness of the masonry and the\r\nsizes of the pillars used in some of the earlier German vaultings are\r\nunnecessarily great, and some of the newer works are much lighter. For\r\nAmerican use, vaulting like that used for the Newton, Mass., covered\r\nreservoir[3] should be amply strong.\r\n\r\nRoofs have been used at Königsberg, Posen, and Budapest instead of\r\nthe masonry vaulting. They are cheaper, but do not afford as good\r\nprotection against frost, and even with great care some ice will form\r\nunder them.\r\n\r\nProvision must be made for entering the filters freely to introduce and\r\nremove sand. This is usually accomplished by raising one section of\r\nvaulting and building a permanent incline under it from the sand line\r\nto a door above the high-water line in the filter.\r\n\r\nThe cost of building covered filters is said to average fully one half\r\nmore than open filters.\r\n\r\nAmong the incidental advantages of covered filters is that with the\r\ncomparative darkness there is no tendency to algæ growths on the\r\nfilters in summer, and the frequency of scraping is therefore somewhat\r\nreduced. At Zürich, in 1892, where both covered and open filters were\r\nin use side by side, the periods between scrapings averaged a third\r\nlonger in the covered than in the open filters.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that covered filters kept the water cool in summer\r\nand warm in winter, but owing to the large volume of water passing, the\r\nchange in temperature in any case is very slight; Frühling found that\r\neven in extreme cases a change of over 3° F. in either direction is\r\nrarely observed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REMOVING ICE FROM A FILTER, EAST LONDON.\r\n\r\nThis represents the greatest accumulation of ice in the history of the\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n  [_To face page 16._]]\r\n\r\nAt Berlin, where open and covered filters were used side by side at\r\nStralau for twenty years, it was found that, bacterially, the open\r\nfilters were, except in severe winter weather, more efficient. It was\r\nlong supposed that this was caused by the sterilizing action of the\r\nsunlight upon the water in the open filters. This result, however, was\r\nnot confirmed elsewhere, and it was finally discovered, in 1893, that\r\nthe higher numbers were due to the existence of passages in corners\r\non the columns of the vaulted roof and around the ventilators for the\r\nunderdrains, through which, practically, unfiltered water found its\r\nway into the effluent. This at once removes the evidence in favor of\r\nthe superior bacterial efficiency of open filters and suggests the\r\nnecessity of preventing such passages. The construction of a ledge all\r\naround the walls and pillars four inches wide and a little above the\r\ngravel, as shown in the sketch, might be useful in this way, and the\r\nslight lateral movement of the water in the sand above would be of no\r\nconsequence. The sand would evidently make a closer joint with the\r\nhorizontal ledge than with the vertical wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the probable requirement or advisability of covers for\r\nfilters in the United States, I judge, from the European experience,\r\nthat places having January temperatures below the freezing-point will\r\nhave considerable trouble from open filters, and would best have\r\ncovered filters. Places having higher winter temperatures will be\r\nable to get along with the ice which may form on open filters, and\r\nthe construction of covers would hardly be advisable except under\r\nexceptional local conditions, as, for instance, with a water with an\r\nunusual tendency to algæ growths.\r\n\r\nI have drawn a line across a map of the United States on this basis\r\n(shown by the accompanying plate) and it would appear that places far\r\nnorth of the line would require covered filters, and that those south\r\nof it would not, while for the places in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nline (comparable to Hamburg and Altona) there is room for discussion.\r\n\r\nIn the United States covered filters have been constructed at St.\r\nJohnsbury, Vt., Somersworth, N. H., Albany, N. Y., Ashland, Wis., and\r\nGrand Forks, N. Dak., all of these places being considerably north of\r\nthe above-mentioned line.\r\n\r\nThe filter at Lawrence, Mass., with a mean January temperature of\r\nabout 25°, is not covered, but serious difficulty and expense have\r\nbeen experienced at times from the ice, so much so that it has been\r\nrepeatedly recommended to cover it. Open filters have also been in use\r\nfor many years at Hudson and Poughkeepsie, N. Y., with mean January\r\ntemperatures about 24°; and although considerable difficulty has been\r\nexperienced from ice at times, these filters, particularly the ones\r\nat Poughkeepsie, have been kept in very serviceable condition at all\r\ntimes, notwithstanding the ice.\r\n\r\nAt Mount Vernon, N. Y., with a mean January temperature of about\r\n31°, and with a reservoir water, no serious difficulty has been\r\nexperienced with ice; and at Far Rockaway, L. I., with a slightly\r\nhigher temperature and well-water, no difficulty whatever has been\r\nexperienced with open filters. Filters at Ilion, N. Y., with a mean\r\nJanuary temperature of about 23°, are not covered, and are fed from a\r\nreservoir. No serious difficulty has been experienced with ice, which\r\nis probably due to the fact that the water applied to them is taken\r\nfrom near the bottom of the reservoir, and ordinarily has a temperature\r\nsomewhat above the freezing-point throughout the winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map showing\r\n\r\nNormal Mean January Temperatures\r\n\r\nIN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nand the Area in which Filters should be covered]\r\n\r\nThe cost of removing ice from filters depends, among other things,\r\nupon the amount of reserve filter area. When this reserve is small\r\nthe filters must be kept constantly at work nearly up to their rated\r\ncapacity; the ice must be removed promptly whenever the filters\r\nrequire cleaning, and under some conditions the expense of doing this\r\nmay be considerable. If, on the other hand, there is a considerable\r\nreserve area, so that when a filter becomes clogged in severe weather,\r\nthe work can be turned upon other filters and the clogged filter\r\nallowed to remain until more moderate weather, or until a thaw, the\r\nexpense of ice removal may be kept at a materially lower figure.\r\n\r\nIn case open filters are built near or north of this line, I would\r\nsuggest that plenty of space between and around the filters for piling\r\nup ice in case of necessity may be found advantageous, and that a\r\ngreater reserve of filtering area for use in emergencies should be\r\nprovided than would be considered necessary with vaulted filters or\r\nwith open filters in a warmer climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFILTERING MATERIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAND.\r\n\r\nThe sand used for filtration may be obtained from the sea-shore, from\r\nriver-beds or from sand-banks. It consists mainly of sharp quartz\r\ngrains, but may also contain hard silicates. As it occurs in nature it\r\nis frequently mixed with clayey or other fine particles, which must be\r\nremoved from it by washing before it is used. Some of the New England\r\nsands, however, as that used for the Lawrence City filter, are so clean\r\nthat washing would be superfluous.\r\n\r\nThe grain size of the sand best adapted to filtration has been\r\nvariously stated at from 1/8 to 1 mm., or from 0.013 to 0.040 inch.\r\nThe variations in the figures, however, are due more to the way that\r\nthe same sand appears to different observers than to actual variations\r\nin the size of sands used, which are but a small fraction of those\r\nindicated by these figures.\r\n\r\nAs a result of experiments made at the Lawrence Experiment Station[4]\r\nwe have a standard by which we can definitely compare various sands.\r\nThe size of a sand-grain is uniformly taken as the diameter of a sphere\r\nof equal volume, regardless of its shape. As a result of numerous\r\nmeasurements of grains of Lawrence sands, it is found that when the\r\ndiameter, as given above, is 1, the three axes of the grain, selecting\r\nthe longest possible and taking the other two at right angles to it,\r\nare, on an average, 1.38, 1.05, and 0.69, respectively and the mean\r\ndiameter is equal to the cube root of their product.\r\n\r\nIt was also found that in mixed materials containing particles of\r\nvarious sizes the water is forced to go around the larger particles and\r\nthrough the finer portions which occupy the intervening spaces, so that\r\nit is the finest portion which mainly determines the character of the\r\nsand for filtration. As a provisional basis which best accounts for the\r\nknown facts, the size of grain such that 10 per cent by weight of the\r\nparticles are smaller and 90 per cent larger than itself, is considered\r\nto be the _effective size_. The size so calculated is uniformly\r\nreferred to in speaking of the size of grain in this work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—APPARATUS USED FOR MEASURING THE FRICTION OF\r\nWATER IN SANDS.]\r\n\r\nAnother important point in regard to a material is its degree of\r\nuniformity—whether the particles are mainly of the same size or whether\r\nthere is a great range in their diameters. This is shown by the\r\n_uniformity coefficient_, a term used to designate the ratio of the\r\nsize of the grain which has 60 per cent of the sample finer than itself\r\nto the size which has 10 per cent finer than itself.\r\n\r\nThe frictional resistance of sand to water when closely packed, with\r\nthe pores completely filled with water and in the entire absence of\r\nclogging, was found to be expressed by the formula\r\n\r\n  _v_ = _cd_^2(_h_/_l_)(_t_ Fah. + 10°)/60,\r\n\r\n  where _v_ is the velocity of the water in meters daily in a solid column\r\n              of the same area as that of the sand, or approximately in\r\n              million gallons per acre daily;\r\n        _c_ is an approximately constant factor;\r\n        _d_ is the effective size of sand grain in millimeters;\r\n        _h_ is the loss of head (Fig. 3);\r\n        _l_ is the thickness of sand through which the water passes;\r\n        _t_ is the temperature (Fahr.).\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING RATE AT WHICH WATER WILL PASS THROUGH EVEN-GRAINED AND\r\nCLEAN SANDS OF THE STATED GRAIN SIZES AND WITH VARIOUS HEADS AT A\r\nTEMPERATURE OF 50°.\r\n\r\n  -------+--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n         |     Effective Size in Millimeters 10 per cent finer than:\r\n  _h_/_l_+------+------+-------+--------+--------+--------+-------+-----\r\n         | 0.10 | 0.20 |  0.30 |  0.35  |  0.40  |  0.50  | 1.00  | 3.00\r\n  -------+------+------+-------+--------+--------+--------+-------+-----\r\n         |      |      | Million Gallons per Acre daily.  |       |\r\n    .001 |  .01 |  .04 |   .10 |    .13 |    .17 |    .27 |  1.07 | 9.63\r\n    .005 |  .05 |  .21 |   .48 |    .65 |    .85 |   1.34 |  5.35 |48.15\r\n    .010 |  .11 |  .43 |   .96 |   1.31 |   1.71 |   2.67 | 10.70 |96.30\r\n    .050 |  .54 | 2.14 |  4.82 |   6.55 |   8.55 |  13.40 | 53.50 |\r\n    .100 | 1.07 | 4.28 |  9.63 |  13.10 |  17.10 |  26.70 |107.00 |\r\n   1.000 |10.70 |42.80 | 96.30 | 131.00 | 171.00 | 267.00 |       |\r\n  -------+------+------+-------+--------+--------+--------+-------+-----\r\n\r\nThe above table is computed with the value _c_ taken as 1000, this\r\nbeing approximately the values deduced from the earliest experiments.\r\nMore recent and extended data have shown that the value of _c_ is not\r\nentirely constant, but depends upon the uniformity coefficient, upon\r\nthe shape of the sand grains, upon their chemical composition, and upon\r\nthe cleanliness and closeness of packing of the sand. The value may be\r\nas high as 1200 for very uniform, and perfectly clean sand, and maybe\r\nas low as 400 for very closely packed sands containing a good deal\r\nof alumina or iron, and especially if they are not quite clean. The\r\nfriction is usually less in new sand than in sand which has been in use\r\nfor some years. In making computations of the frictional resistance\r\nof filters, the average value of _c_ may be taken at from 700 to 1000\r\nfor new sand, and from 500 to 700 for sand which has been in use for a\r\nnumber of years.\r\n\r\nThe value of _c_ decreases as the uniformity coefficient increases.\r\nWith ordinary filter sands with uniformity coefficients of 3 or less\r\nthe differences are not great. With mixed sands having much higher\r\nuniformity coefficients, lower and less constant values of _c_ are\r\nobtained, and the arrangement of the particles becomes a controlling\r\nfactor in the increase in friction.\r\n\r\nThe friction of the surface layer of a filter is often greater than\r\nthat of all the sand below the surface. It must be separately computed\r\nand added to the resistances computed by the formula, as it depends\r\nlargely upon other conditions than those controlling the resistance of\r\nthe sand.\r\n\r\nWhile the value of _c_ is thus not entirely constant, it can be\r\nestimated with approximate accuracy for various conditions, from a\r\nknowledge of the composition, condition, and cleanliness of the sand,\r\nand closeness of packing.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the quantity of water passing sands at\r\ndifferent temperatures. This table was computed with temperature\r\nfactors as given above, which were based upon experiments upon the\r\nflow of water through sands, checked by the coefficients obtained from\r\nexperiments with long capillary tubes entirely submerged in water of\r\nthe required temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIVE QUANTITIES OF WATER PASSING AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES.\r\n\r\n  32° 0.70\r\n  35° 0.75\r\n  38° 0.80\r\n  41° 0.85\r\n  44° 0.90\r\n  47° 0.95\r\n  50° 1.00\r\n  53° 1.05\r\n  56° 1.10\r\n  59° 1.15\r\n  62° 1.20\r\n  65° 1.25\r\n  68° 1.30\r\n  71° 1.35\r\n  74° 1.40\r\n  77° 1.45\r\n\r\nThe effect of temperature upon the passage of water through sands and\r\nsoils has been further discussed by Prof. L. G. Carpenter, _Engineering\r\nNews_, Vol. XXXIX, p. 422. This article reviews briefly the literature\r\nof the subject, and refers at length to the formula of Poiseuille,\r\npublished in the _Memoires des Savants Etrangers_, Vol. XI, p. 433\r\n(1846). This formula, in which the quantity of water passing at 0.0°\r\nCent., is taken as unity, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Temperature factor = 1 + 0.033679_t_ + 0.000221_t_^2.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by this formula agree very closely with those\r\ngiven in the above table throughout the temperature range for\r\nwhich computations are most frequently required. At the higher and\r\nlower temperatures the divergencies are greater, as is shown in a\r\ncommunication in the _Engineering News_, Vol. XL, p. 26.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water passing at a temperature of 50° Fahr. is in many\r\nrespects more convenient as a standard than the quantity passing at the\r\nfreezing-point. Near the freezing-point, owing to molecular changes in\r\nthe water, the changes in its action are rapid, and the results are\r\nless certain, and also 50° Fahr. is a much more convenient temperature\r\nfor precise experiments than is the freezing point.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANDS USED IN EUROPEAN FILTERS.\r\n\r\nTo secure definite information in regard to the qualities of the sands\r\nactually used in filtration, a large number of European works were\r\nvisited in 1894, and samples of sand were collected for analysis. These\r\nsamples were examined at the Lawrence Experiment Station by Mr. H. W.\r\nClark, the author’s method of analysis described in Appendix III being\r\nused. In the following table, for the sake of compactness, only the\r\nleading points of the analyses, namely, effective size, uniformity\r\ncoefficient, and albuminoid ammonia, are given. On page 28 full\r\nanalyses of some samples from a few of the leading works are given.\r\n\r\nANALYSES OF SANDS USED IN WATER FILTRATION.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+---------+--------+--------+--------------------\r\n                       |Effective|        |  Albu- |\r\n                       |Size; 10%|  Uni-  | minoid |\r\n                       |  Finer  |formity |  Ammo- |\r\n         Source.       |   than  | Coeffi-|  nia.  |     Remarks.\r\n                       |(Milli-  | cient. |Parts in|\r\n                       | meters).|        |100,000.|\r\n  ---------------------+---------+--------+--------+--------------------\r\n  London, E.

is shown to be the case by different\r\n  samples from some of the works, the examination of such a limited\r\n  number of samples as the above from each place is entirely inadequate\r\n  to establish accurately the sizes of sand used at that particular\r\n  place, or to allow close comparisons between the different works, and\r\n  for this reason no such comparisons will be made. The object of these\r\n  investigations was to determine the sizes of the sands commonly used\r\n  in Europe, and, considering the number and character of the different\r\n  works represented, it is believed that the results are ample for this\r\n  purpose.\r\n\r\nThe English and most of the German sands are washed, even when entirely\r\nnew, before being used, to remove fine particles. At Breslau, however,\r\nsand dredged from the river Oder is used in its natural state, and\r\nnew sand is used for replacing that removed by scraping. At Budapest,\r\nDanube sand is used in the same way, but with a very crude washing, and\r\nit is said that only new unwashed sand is used at Warsaw.\r\n\r\nIn Holland, so far as I learned, no sand is washed, but new sand is\r\nalways used for refilling. At most of the works visited dune-sand\r\nwith an effective size of only 0.17 to 0.19 mm. is used, and this is\r\nthe finest sand which I have ever found used for water filtration on\r\na large scale. It should be said, however, that the waters filtered\r\nthrough these fine sands are fairly clear before filtration, and are\r\nnot comparable to the turbid river-waters often filtered elsewhere,\r\nand their tendency to choke the filters is consequently much less. At\r\nRotterdam and Schiedam, where the raw water is drawn from the Maas, as\r\nthe principal stream of the Rhine is called in Holland, river-sand of\r\nmuch larger grain size is employed. It is obtained by dredging in the\r\nriver and is never washed, new sand always being employed for refilling.\r\n\r\nThe average results of the complete analyses of sands from ten leading\r\nworks are shown in the table on page 28. These figures are the average\r\nof all the analyses for the respective places, except that one sample\r\nfrom the Lambeth Co., which was not a representative one, was omitted.\r\n\r\nThe London companies were selected for this comparison both on\r\naccount of their long and favorable records in filtering the polluted\r\nwaters of the Thames and Lea, and because they are subject to close\r\ninspection; and there is ample evidence that the filtration obtained is\r\ngood—evidence which is often lacking in the smaller and less closely\r\nwatched works. For the German works Altona was selected because of\r\nits escape from cholera in 1892, due to the efficient action of its\r\nfilters, and Stralau because of its long and favorable record when\r\nfiltering the much-polluted Spree water. These two works also have\r\nperhaps contributed more to the modern theories of filtration than all\r\nthe other works in existence. The remaining works are included because\r\nthey are comparatively new, and have been constructed with the greatest\r\ncare and attention to details throughout, and the results obtained are\r\nmost carefully recorded.\r\n\r\nSome of the most interesting of these results are shown graphically on\r\npage 29. The method of plotting is that described in Appendix III.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE AVERAGE PER CENT OF THE GRAINS FINER THAN VARIOUS\r\nSIZES IN SANDS FROM LEADING WORKS.\r\n\r\n  --------------+----------------------------------------------------\r\n                |       Per Cent by Weight Finer than\r\n                +------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------\r\n                |0.106 |0.186 |0.316 |0.46 |0.93 |2.04 |3.89 |5.89\r\n                | mm.  | mm.  | mm.  | mm. | mm. | mm. | mm. | mm.\r\n  --------------+------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------\r\n  East London   | 0.2  | 0.5  | 3.6  |22.2 |69.7 |89.8 |95.0 |99.0\r\n  Grand Junction|  0   | 0.2  | 3.1  |17.4 |47.1 |68.2 |84.7 |93.6\r\n  Southwark and |      |      |      |     |     |     |     |\r\n   Vauxhall     |      | 0.7  | 8.0  |34.1 |69.7 |83.5 |90.0 |94.0\r\n  Lambeth       |  0   | 0.5  | 5.5  |26.6 |63.0 |79.2 |88.0 |94.3\r\n  Chelsea       |  0   | 0.1  | 5.0  |28.6 |63.0 |76.7 |86.0 |93.6\r\n  Hamburg       | 0.2  | 1.5  |10.9  |33.2 |74.4 |95.7 |99.5 |\r\n  Altona        | 0.1  | 1.1  | 7.8  |28.7 |72.1 |92.1 |95.8 |\r\n  Stralau       |      | 0.3  | 7.0  |37.3 |86.9 |95.4 |97.6 |\r\n  Tegel         |      | 0.2  | 4.5  |35.4 |94.3 |98.5 |99.1 |\r\n  Müggel        | 0.1  | 0.5  | 7.9  |33.6 |79.7 |94.3 |98.5 |\r\n                +------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------\r\n  Average of all| 0.06 | 0.56 | 6.33 |29.71|71.99|87.34|93.42|(97.45)\r\n  --------------+------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------\r\n\r\n\r\nAVERAGE EFFECTIVE SIZE, UNIFORMITY COEFFICIENT, AND ALBUMINOID AMMONIA\r\nIN SANDS FROM TEN LEADING WORKS.\r\n\r\n                        I.

The entire range for the ten\r\nworks is only from 0.31 to 0.40 mm., and these may be taken as the\r\nordinary limits of effective size of the sands employed in the best\r\nEuropean works. The average for the other sixteen works given above,\r\nincluding dune-sands, is 0.31 mm., or, omitting the dune-sands, 0.34 mm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3_a_.—SAND ANALYSIS SHEET, WITH ANALYSES OF SEVERAL\r\nEUROPEAN FILTER SANDS.]\r\n\r\nIt is important that filter sands should be free from lime. When water\r\nis filtered through such sands, no increase in hardness results. When,\r\nhowever, water is filtered through sand containing lime, some of it\r\nis usually dissolved and the water is made harder. The amount of lime\r\ntaken up in this way depends both upon the character of the sand, and\r\nupon the solvent power of the water; and it does not necessarily follow\r\nthat a sand containing lime cannot be used for filtration, but a sand\r\nnearly free from lime is to be preferred.\r\n\r\nThe presence of lime in sand can usually be detected by moistening it\r\nwith hydrochloric acid. The evolution of gas shows the presence of\r\nlime. Some idea of the amount of lime can be obtained from the amount\r\nof gas given off, and the appearance of the sample after the treatment,\r\nbut chemical analysis is necessary to determine correctly the amount.\r\n\r\nExperiments with filters at Pittsburg were made with sand containing\r\n1.3 per cent of lime, the result being that the hardness of the water\r\nwas increased about one part in 100,000; but the amount of lime in the\r\nsand was so small that it would be washed out after a time, and then\r\nthe hardening effect would cease. Larger amounts of lime would continue\r\ntheir action for a number of years and would be more objectionable.\r\n\r\nTurning to the circumstances which influence the selection of the\r\nsand size, we find that both the quality of the effluent obtained by\r\nfiltration and the cost of filtration depend upon the size of the\r\nsand-grains.\r\n\r\nWith a fine sand the sediment layer forms more quickly and the removal\r\nof bacteria is more complete, but, on the other hand, the filter clogs\r\nquicker and the dirty sand is more difficult to wash, so that the\r\nexpense is increased.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF SIZE OF GRAIN UPON EFFICIENCY OF FILTRATION.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently stated that it is only the sediment layer which\r\nperforms the work of filtration, and that the sand which supports\r\nit plays hardly a larger part than does the gravel which carries\r\nthe sand, and under some circumstances this is undoubtedly the case.\r\nNevertheless sand in itself, without any sediment layer, especially\r\nwhen not too coarse and not in too thin layers, has very great\r\npurifying powers, and, in addition, acts as a safeguard by positively\r\npreventing excessive rates of filtration on account of its frictional\r\nresistance. As an illustration take the case of a filter of sand with\r\nan effective size of 0.35 mm. and the minimum thickness of sand allowed\r\nby the German Board of Health, namely, one foot, and let us suppose\r\nthat with clogging the loss of head has reached two feet to produce\r\nthe desired velocity of 2.57 million gallons per acre daily. Suppose\r\nnow that by some accident the sediment layer is suddenly broken or\r\nremoved from a small area, the water will rush through this area,\r\nuntil a new sediment layer is formed, at a rate corresponding to the\r\nsize, pressure, and depth of the sand, or 260 million gallons per\r\nacre daily—a hundred times the standard rate. Under these conditions\r\nthe passing water will not be purified, but will pollute the entire\r\neffluent from the filter. Under corresponding conditions, with a deep\r\nfilter of fine sand, say with an effective size of 0.20 mm. and 5 feet\r\ndeep, the resulting rate would be only 17 million gallons per acre\r\ndaily, or less than seven times the normal, and with the water passing\r\nthrough the full depth of fine sand, the resulting deterioration in the\r\neffluent before the sand again became so clogged as to reduce the rate\r\nto nearly the normal, would be hardly appreciable.\r\n\r\nThe results at Lawrence have shown that with very fine sands 0.09 and\r\n0.14 mm., and 4 to 5 feet deep, with the quantity of water which can\r\npractically be made to pass through them, it is almost impossible to\r\ndrive more than an insignificant fraction of the bacteria into the\r\neffluent. Even when the sands are entirely new, or have been scraped or\r\ndisturbed in the most violent way, the first effluent passing, before\r\nthe sediment layer could have been formed, is of good quality. Still\r\nfiner materials, 0.04 to 0.06 mm., as far as could be determined,\r\nsecured the absolute removal of all bacteria, but the rates of\r\nfiltration which were possible were so low as to preclude their\r\npractical application.\r\n\r\nWith coarser sands, as long as the filter is kept at a steady rate of\r\nfiltration, without interruptions of any kind, entirely satisfactory\r\nresults are often obtained, although never quite so good as with\r\nthe finer sands. Thus at Lawrence the percentages of bacteria (_B.\r\nprodigiosus_) appearing in the effluents under comparable conditions\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n                                        1892   1893\r\n  With effective grain size 0.38 mm     ....   0.16\r\n  With effective grain size 0.29 mm     ....   0.16\r\n  With effective grain size 0.26 mm     ....   0.10\r\n  With effective grain size 0.20 mm     0.13   0.01\r\n  With effective grain size 0.14 mm     0.04   0.03\r\n  With effective grain size 0.09 mm     0.02   0.02\r\n\r\nWe may thus conclude that fine sands give normally somewhat better\r\neffluents than coarser ones, and that they are much more likely to\r\ngive at least a tolerably good purification under unusual or improper\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF GRAIN SIZE UPON FREQUENCY OF SCRAPING.\r\n\r\nThe practical objection to the use of fine sand is that it becomes\r\nrapidly clogged, so that filters require to be scraped at shorter\r\nintervals, and the sand washing is much more difficult and expensive.\r\nThe quantities of water filtered between successive scrapings at\r\nLawrence in millions of gallons per acre under comparable conditions\r\nhave been as follows:\r\n\r\n                                          1892   1893\r\n  Effective size of sand grain 0.38 mm    ....    79\r\n  Effective size of sand grain 0.29 mm    ....    70\r\n  Effective size of sand grain 0.26 mm    ....    57\r\n  Effective size of sand grain 0.20 mm     58    ....\r\n  Effective size of sand grain 0.14 mm     45     49\r\n  Effective size of sand grain 0.09 mm     24     14\r\n\r\nThe increase in the quantities passed between scrapings with increasing\r\ngrain size is very marked.\r\n\r\nWith the fine sands, the depth to which the sand becomes dirty is much\r\nless than with the coarse sands, but as it is not generally practicable\r\nto remove a layer of sand less than about 0.6 inch thick, even when the\r\nactual clogged layer is thinner than this, the full quantity of sand\r\nhas to be removed; and the quantities of sand to be removed and washed\r\nare inversely proportional to the quantities of water filtered between\r\nscrapings. On the other hand, with very coarse sands the sediment\r\npenetrates the sand to a greater depth than the 0.6 inch necessarily\r\nremoved, so that a thicker layer of sand has to be removed, which\r\nmay more than offset the longer interval. This happens occasionally\r\nin water-works, and a sand coarse enough to allow it occur is always\r\ndisliked by superintendents, and is replaced with finer sand as soon as\r\npossible. It is obvious that the minimum expense for cleaning will be\r\nsecured with a sand which just does not allow this deep penetration,\r\nand I am inclined to think that the sizes of the sands in use have\r\nactually been determined more often than otherwise in this way, and\r\nthat the coarsest samples found, having effective sizes of about 0.40\r\nmm., represent the practical limit to the coarseness of the sand,\r\nand that any increase above this size would be followed by increased\r\nexpense for cleaning as well as by decreased efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF SAND.\r\n\r\nIn selecting a sand for filtration, when it is considered that repeated\r\nwashings will remove some of the finest particles, and so increase\r\nslightly the effective size, a new sand coarser than 0.35 mm. would\r\nhardly be selected. Perhaps 0.20 might be given as a suitable lower\r\nlimit. For comparatively clear lake- or reservoir-waters a finer\r\nsand could probably be used than would be the case with a turbid\r\nriver-water. A mixed sand having a uniformity coefficient above 3.0\r\nwould be difficult to wash without separating it into portions of\r\ndifferent sizes, and, in general, the lower the coefficient, that is,\r\nthe more uniform the grain sizes, the better. Great pains should be\r\ntaken to have the sand of the same quality throughout, especially in\r\nthe same filter, as any variations in the grain sizes would lead to\r\nimportant variations in the velocity of filtration, the coarser sands\r\npassing more than their share of water (in proportion to the square of\r\nthe effective sizes) and with reduced efficiency.\r\n\r\nAt Lawrence a sufficient quantity of natural sand was found of the\r\ngrade required; but where suitable material cannot be so obtained it\r\nis necessary to use other methods. A mixed material can be screened\r\nfrom particles which are too large, and can be washed to free it from\r\nits finer portions, and in this way a good sand can be prepared, if\r\nnecessary, from what might seem to be quite unpromising material. The\r\nmethods of sand-washing will be described in Chapter V.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHICKNESS OF THE SAND LAYER.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the sand layer is made so great that when it is\r\nrepeatedly scraped in cleaning the sand will not become too thin for\r\ngood filtration for a considerable time. When this occurs the removed\r\nsand must be replaced with clean sand. The original thickness of the\r\nsand in European filters is usually from 24 to 48 inches, thicknesses\r\nbetween 30 and 40 inches being extremely common, and this is reduced\r\nbefore refilling to from 12 to 24 inches. The Imperial Board of Health\r\nof Germany has fixed 12 inches as a limit below which the sand should\r\nnever be scraped, and a higher limit is recommended wherever possible.\r\n\r\nA thick sand layer has the same steadying action as a fine sand, and\r\ntends to prevent irregularities in the rate of filtration in proportion\r\nto its frictional resistance, and that without increasing the frequency\r\nof cleaning; but, on the other hand, it increases the necessary height\r\nof the filter, throughout, and consequently the cost of construction.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the steadying effect of a deep sand layer, some\r\npurification takes place in the lower part of the sand even with a good\r\nsediment layer on the surface, and the efficiency of deep filters is\r\ngreater than that of shallow ones.\r\n\r\nLayers of finer materials, as fine sand or loam, in the lower part\r\nof a filter, which would otherwise give increased efficiency without\r\nincreasing the operating expenses, cannot be used. Their presence\r\ninvariably gives rise sooner or later to sub-surface clogging at the\r\npoint of junction with the coarser sand, as has been found by repeated\r\ntests at Lawrence as well as in some of the Dutch filters where such\r\nlayers were tried; and as there is no object in putting a coarser sand\r\nunder a finer, the filter sand is best all of the same size and quality\r\nfrom top to bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDERDRAINING.\r\n\r\nThe underdrains of a filter are simply useful for collecting the\r\nfiltered water; they play no part in the purification. One of the first\r\nrequirements of successful filtration is that the rate of filtration\r\nshall be practically the same in all parts of the filter. This is most\r\ndifficult to secure when the filter has just been cleaned and the\r\nfriction of the sand layer is at a minimum. If the friction of the\r\nwater in entering and passing through the underdrains is considerable,\r\nthe more remote parts of the filters will work under less pressure,\r\nand will thus do less than their share of the work, while the parts\r\nnear the outlet will be overtaxed, and filtering at too high rates will\r\nyield poor effluents.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this condition the underdrains must have such a capacity\r\nthat their frictional resistance will be only a small fraction of the\r\nfriction in the sand itself just after cleaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAVEL LAYERS.\r\n\r\nThe early filters contained an enormous quantity of gravel, but the\r\nquantity has been steadily reduced in successive plants. Thus in 1866\r\nKirkwood, as a result of his observations, recommended the use of a\r\nlayer four feet thick, and in addition a foot of coarse sand, while\r\nat the present time new filters rarely have more than two feet of\r\ngravel. Even this quantity seems quite superfluous, when calculations\r\nof its frictional resistance are made. Thus a layer of gravel with an\r\neffective size of 20 mm.[5] (which is much finer than that generally\r\nemployed) only 6 inches thick will carry the effluent from a filter\r\nworking at a rate of 2.57 million gallons per acre daily for a distance\r\nof 8 feet (that is, with underdrains 16 feet apart), with a loss of\r\nhead of only 0.001 foot, and for longer distances tile drains are\r\ncheaper than gravel. To prevent the sand from sinking into the coarse\r\ngravel, intermediate sizes of gravel must be placed between, each grade\r\nbeing coarse enough so that there is no possibility of its sinking into\r\nthe layer below. The necessary thickness of these intermediate layers\r\nis very small, the principal point being to have a layer of each grade\r\nat every point. Thus on the 6 inches of 20 mm. gravel mentioned above,\r\nthree layers of two inches each, of 8 and 3 mm. gravel and coarse\r\nsand, with a total height of six inches, or other corresponding and\r\nconvenient depths and sizes, would, if carefully placed, as effectually\r\nprevent the sinking of the filter sand into the coarse gravel as the\r\nmuch thicker layers used in the older plants.\r\n\r\nThe gravel around the drains should receive special attention. Larger\r\nstones can be here used with advantage, taking care that adequate\r\nspaces are left for the entrance of the water into the drains at a low\r\nvelocity, and to make everything so solid in this neighborhood that\r\nthere will be no chance for the stones to settle which might allow the\r\nsand to reach the drains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RECONSTRUCTING THE UNDERDRAINAGE SYSTEM OF A FILTER\r\nAFTER 25 YEARS OF USE, BREMEN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLACING SAND IN A FILTER, CHOISY LE ROI (PARIS).\r\n\r\n[_To face page 36._]]\r\n\r\nAt the Lawrence filter, at Königsberg in Prussia, at Amsterdam and\r\nother places, the quantity of gravel is reduced by putting the drains\r\nin trenches, so that the gravel is reduced from a maximum thickness\r\nat the drain to nothing half way between drains. The economy of the\r\narrangement, however, as far as friction is concerned is not so great\r\nas would appear at first sight, and the cost of the bottom may be\r\nincreased; but on the other hand it gives a greater depth of gravel for\r\ncovering the drains with a small total amount of gravel.\r\n\r\nAs even a very small percentage of fine material is capable of\r\ngetting in the narrow places and reducing the carrying power of the\r\ngravel, it is important that all such matters should be carefully\r\nremoved by washing before putting the gravel in place. In England and\r\nGermany gravel is commonly screened for use in revolving cylinders of\r\nwire-cloth of the desired sizes, on which water is freely played from\r\nnumerous jets, thus securing perfectly clean gravel. In getting gravel\r\nfor the Lawrence filter, an apparatus was used, in which advantage was\r\ntaken of the natural slope of the gravel bank to do the work, and the\r\nuse of power was avoided. The respective grades of gravel obtained were\r\neven in size, and reasonably free from fine material, but it was deemed\r\nbest to wash them with a hose before putting them in the filter.\r\n\r\nTo calculate the frictional resistance of water in passing gravel, we\r\nmay assume that for the very low velocities which are actually found in\r\nfilters the quantity of water passing varies directly with the head,\r\nwhich for these velocities is substantially correct, although it would\r\nnot be true for higher rates, especially with the coarser gravels.[6]\r\nIn the case of parallel underdrains the friction from the middle point\r\nbetween drains to the drains may be calculated by the formula:\r\n\r\nTotal head = (1/2)[(Rate of filtration × (1/2 distance between\r\ndrains)^2)/(Average depth of gravel × discharge coefficient)].\r\n\r\nThe discharge coefficient for any gravel is 1000 times the quantity\r\n\r\nof water which will pass when _h_/_l_ is 1/1000 expressed in million\r\ngallons per acre daily. The approximate values of this coefficient for\r\ndifferent-sized gravels are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUES OF DISCHARGE COEFFICIENT.\r\n\r\n  For gravel with effective size 5 mm     _c_ =  23,000\r\n  For gravel with effective size10 mm     _c_ =  65,000\r\n  For gravel with effective size15 mm     _c_ = 110,000\r\n  For gravel with effective size20 mm     _c_ = 160,000\r\n  For gravel with effective size25 mm     _c_ = 230,000\r\n  For gravel with effective size30 mm     _c_ = 300,000\r\n  For gravel with effective size35 mm     _c_ = 390,000\r\n  For gravel with effective size40 mm     _c_ = 480,000\r\n\r\nExample: What is the loss of head in the gravel at a rate of filtration\r\nof 2 million gallons per acre daily, with underdrains 20 feet apart,\r\nwhere the supporting gravel has an effective size of 35 millimeters,\r\nand is uniformly 1 ft. deep?\r\n\r\nTotal head = (1/2)[(2 × 10^2)/(1 × 390,000)] = .000256 ft.\r\n\r\nThe total friction would be the same with the same average depth of\r\ngravel whether it was uniformly 1 foot deep, or decreasing from 1.5 at\r\nthe drains to 0.5 in the middle, or from 2.0 to 0. The reverse case\r\nwith the gravel layer thicker in the middle than at the drains does not\r\noccur and need not be discussed.\r\n\r\nThe depth of gravel likely to be adopted as a result of this\r\ncalculation, when the drains are not too far apart, will be much less\r\nthan that actually used in most European works, but as the two feet or\r\nmore there employed are, I believe, simply the result of speculation,\r\nthere is no reason for following the precedent where calculations show\r\nthat a smaller quantity is adequate.\r\n\r\nThe reason for recommending a thin lower layer of coarse gravel, which\r\nalone is assumed to provide for the lateral movement of the water,\r\nis that if more than about six inches of gravel is required to give a\r\nsatisfactory resistance, it will almost always be cheaper to use more\r\ndrains instead of more gravel; and the reason for recommending thinner\r\nupper layers for preventing the sand from settling into the coarse\r\ngravel is that no failures of this portion of filters are on record,\r\nand in the few instances where really thin layers have been used the\r\nresults have been entirely satisfactory. In Königsberg filters were\r\nbuilt by Frühling,[7] in which the sand was supported by five layers\r\nof gravel of increasing sizes, respectively 1.2, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 3.2,\r\nor, together, 9.2 inches thick, below which there were an average of\r\nfive inches of coarse gravel. These were examined after eight years of\r\noperation and found to be in perfect order.\r\n\r\nAt the Lawrence Experiment Station filters have been repeatedly\r\nconstructed with a total depth of supporting gravel layers not\r\nexceeding six inches, and among the scores of such filters there has\r\nnot been a single failure, and so far as they have been dug up there\r\nhas never been found to have been any movement whatever of the sand\r\ninto the gravel. The Lawrence city filter, built with corresponding\r\nlayers, has shown no signs of being inadequately supported. In\r\narranging the Lawrence gravel layers care has always been taken that no\r\nmaterial should rest on another material more than three or four times\r\nas coarse as itself, and that each layer should be complete at every\r\npoint, so that by no possibility could two layers of greater difference\r\nin size come together. And it is believed that if this is carefully\r\nattended to, no trouble need be anticipated, however thin the single\r\nlayers may be.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDERDRAINS.\r\n\r\nThe most common arrangement, in other than very small filters, is to\r\nhave a main drain through the middle of the filter, with lateral\r\ndrains at regular intervals from it to the sides. The sides of the main\r\ndrain are of brick, laid with open joints to admit water freely, and\r\nthe top is usually covered with stone slabs. The lateral drains may be\r\nbuilt in the same way, but tile drains are also used and are cheaper.\r\nCare must be taken with the latter that ample openings are left for the\r\nadmission of water at very low velocities. It is considered desirable\r\nto have these drains go no higher than the top of the coarsest gravel;\r\nand this will often control the depth of gravel used. If they go\r\nhigher, the top must be made tight to prevent the entrance of the fine\r\ngravels or sand. Sometimes they are sunk in part or wholly (especially\r\nthe main drain) below the floor of the filter. With gravel placed in\r\nwaves, that is, thicker over the drains than elsewhere, as mentioned\r\nabove, the drains are covered more easily than with an entirely\r\nhorizontal arrangement. When this is done, the floor of the filter is\r\ntrenched to meet the varying thickness of gravel, so that the top of\r\nthe latter is level, and the sand has a uniform thickness.\r\n\r\nMany filters (Lambeth, Brunswick, etc.) are built with a double bottom\r\nof brick, the upper layer of which, with open joints, supports the\r\ngravel and sand, and is itself supported by numerous small arches or\r\nother arrangements of brick, which serve to carry the water to the\r\noutlet without other drains. This arrangement allows the use of a\r\nminimum quantity of gravel, but is undoubtedly more expensive than the\r\nusual form, with only the necessary quantity of gravel; and I am unable\r\nto find that it has any corresponding advantages.\r\n\r\nThe frictional resistance of underdrains requires to be carefully\r\ncalculated; and in doing this quite different standards must be\r\nfollowed from those usually employed in determining the sizes\r\nof water-pipes, as a total frictional resistance of only a few\r\nhundredths of a foot, including the velocity head, may cause serious\r\nirregularities in the rate of filtration in different parts of the\r\nfilter.\r\n\r\nThe sizes of the underdrains differ very widely in proportion to the\r\nsizes of the filters in European works, some of them being excessively\r\nlarge, while in other cases they are so small as to suggest a doubt as\r\nto their allowing uniform rates of filtration, especially just after\r\ncleaning.\r\n\r\nI would suggest the following rules as reasonably sure to lead to\r\nsatisfactory results without making an altogether too lavish provision:\r\nIn the absence of a definite determination to run filters at some\r\nother rate, calculate the drains for the German standard rate of a\r\ndaily column of 2.40 meters, equal to 2.57 million gallons per acre\r\ndaily. This will insure satisfactory work at all lower rates, and\r\nno difficulty on account of the capacity of the underdrains need be\r\nthen anticipated if the rate is somewhat exceeded. The area for a\r\ncertain distance from the main drain depending upon the gravel may be\r\ncalculated as draining directly into it, provided there are suitable\r\nopenings, and the rest of the area is supposed to drain to the nearest\r\nlateral drain.\r\n\r\nIn case the laterals are round-tile drains I would suggest the\r\nfollowing limits to the areas which they should be allowed to drain:\r\n\r\n  Diameter of Drain.   To Drain an Area not   Corresponding Velocity of\r\n                            Exceeding             Water in Drain.\r\n   4 inches               290 square feet.         0.30 foot.\r\n   6 inches               750 square feet.         0.35 foot.\r\n   8 inches              1530 square feet.         0.40 foot.\r\n  10 inches              2780 square feet.         0.46 foot.\r\n  12 inches              4400 square feet.         0.51 foot.\r\n\r\nAnd for larger drains, including the main drains, their cross-sections\r\nat any point should be at least 1/6000 of the area drained, giving a\r\nvelocity of 0.55 foot per second with the rate of filtration mentioned\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThe total friction of the underdrains from the most remote points\r\nto the outlet will be friction in the gravel, plus friction in the\r\nlateral drains, plus the friction in main drain, plus the velocity head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—PLAN OF ONE OF THE HAMBURG FILTERS, SHOWING\r\nFRICTIONAL RESISTANCE OF THE UNDERDRAINS.]\r\n\r\nI have calculated in this way the friction of one of the Hamburg\r\nfilters for the rate of 1,600,000 gallons per acre daily at which it\r\nis used. The friction was calculated for each section of the drains\r\nseparately, so that the friction from intermediate points was also\r\nknown. Kutter’s formula was used throughout with _n_ = 0.013. On\r\nthe accompanying plan of the filter I have drawn the lines of equal\r\nfrictional resistance from the junction of the main drain with the last\r\nlaterals. My information was incomplete in regard to one or two points,\r\nso that the calculation may not be strictly accurate, but it is nearly\r\nso and will illustrate the principles involved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONSTRUCTING THE UNDERDRAINAGE SYSTEM OF A FILTER,\r\nHAMBURG.\r\n\r\n  [_To face page 42._]\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe extreme friction of the underdrains is 11 millimeters = 0.036 foot.\r\n\r\nThe frictional resistance of the sand 39 inches thick, effective size\r\n0.32 mm. and rate 1.60 million gallons per acre daily, when absolutely\r\nfree from clogging, is by the formula, page 21, 15mm., or .0490\r\nfoot, when the temperature is 50°. Practically there is some matter\r\ndeposited upon the surface of the sand before filtration starts, and\r\nfurther, after the first scraping, there is some slight clogging in the\r\nsand below the layer removed by scraping. We can thus safely take the\r\nminimum frictional resistance of the sand including the surface layer\r\nat .07 foot. The average friction of the underdrains for all points\r\nis about .023 foot and the friction at starting will be .07 + .023 =\r\n.093 foot (including the friction in the last section to the effluent\r\nwell where the head is measured, .100 foot, but the friction beyond the\r\nlast lateral does not affect the uniformity of filtration). The actual\r\nhead on the sand close to the outlet will be .093 and the rate of\r\nfiltration .093/.070 · 1.60 = 2.12. The actual head at the most remote\r\npoint will be .093 - .036 = .057, and the rate of filtration will there\r\nbe .057/.070 · 160 = 1.30 million gallons per acre daily. The extreme\r\nrates of filtration are thus 2.12 and 1.30, instead of the average rate\r\nof 1.60. As can be seen from the diagram, only very small areas work\r\nat these extreme rates, the great bulk of the area working at rates\r\nmuch nearer the average. Actually the filter is started at a rate below\r\n1.60, and the nearest portion never filters so rapidly as 2.12, for\r\nwhen the rate is increased to the standard, the sand has become so far\r\nclogged that the loss of head is more than the .07 foot assumed, and\r\nthe differences in the rates are correspondingly reduced. Taking this\r\ninto account, it would not seem that the irregularities in the rate of\r\nfiltration are sufficient to affect seriously the action of the filter.\r\nThey could evidently have been largely reduced by moderately increasing\r\nthe sizes of the lower ends of the underdrains, where most of the\r\nfriction occurs with the high velocities (up to .97 foot) which there\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe underdrains of the Warsaw filters were designed by Lindley to have\r\na maximum loss of head of only .0164 foot when filtering at a rate of\r\n2.57, which gives a variation of only 10 per cent in the rates with the\r\nminimum loss of head of .169 foot in the entire filter assumed by him.\r\nThe underdrains of the Berlin filters, according to my calculations,\r\nhave .020 to .030 foot friction, of which an unusually large proportion\r\nis in the gravel, owing to the excessive distances, in some cases over\r\n80 feet, which the gravel is required to carry the water. In this case,\r\nusing less or finer gravel would obviously have been fatal, but the\r\nfriction as well as the expense of construction would be much reduced\r\nby using more drains and less gravel.\r\n\r\nThe underdrains might appropriately be made slightly smaller, with a\r\ndeep layer of fine sand, than under opposite conditions, as in this\r\ncase the increased friction in the drains would be no greater in\r\nproportion to the increased friction in the sand itself.\r\n\r\nThe underdrains of a majority of European filters have water-tight\r\npipes connecting with them at intervals, and going up through the sand\r\nand above the water, where they are open to the air. These pipes were\r\nintended to ventilate the underdrains and allow the escape of air when\r\nthe filter is filled with water introduced from below. It may be said,\r\nhowever, that in case the drains are surrounded by gravel and there is\r\nan opportunity for the air to pass from the top of the drain into the\r\ngravel, it will so escape without special provision being made for it,\r\nand go up through the sand with the much larger quantity of air in the\r\nupper part of the gravel which is incapable of being removed by pipes\r\nconnecting with the drains.\r\n\r\nThese ventilator pipes where they are used are a source of much\r\ntrouble, as unfiltered water is apt to run down through cracks in the\r\nsand beside them, and, under bad management, unfiltered water may even\r\ngo down through the pipes themselves. I am unable to find that they\r\nare necessary, except with underdrains so constructed that there is\r\nno other chance for the escape of air from the tops of them, or that\r\nthey serve any useful purpose, while there are positive objections to\r\ntheir use. In some of the newer filters they have been omitted with\r\nsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPTH OF WATER ON THE FILTERS.\r\n\r\nIn the older works with but crude appliances for regulating the rate of\r\nfiltration and admission of raw water, a considerable depth of water\r\nwas necessary upon the filter to balance irregularities in the rates\r\nof filtration; the filter was made to be, to a certain extent, its own\r\nstorage reservoir. When, however, appliances of the character to be\r\ndescribed in Chapter IV are used for the regulation of the incoming\r\nwater, and with a steady rate of filtration, this provision becomes\r\nquite superfluous.\r\n\r\nWith open filters a depth of water in excess of the thickness of any\r\nice likely to be formed is required to prevent disturbance or freezing\r\nof the sand in winter. It is also frequently urged that with a deep\r\nwater layer on the filter the water does not become so much heated in\r\nsummer, but this point is not believed to be well taken, for in any\r\ngiven case the total amount of heat coming from the sun to a given area\r\nis constant, and the quantity of water heated in the whole day—that\r\nis, the amount filtered—is constant, and variations in the quantity\r\nexposed at one time will not affect the average resulting increase in\r\ntemperature. If the same water remained upon the filter without change\r\nit would of course be true that a thin layer would be heated more than\r\na deep one, but this is not the case.\r\n\r\nIt is also sometimes recommended that the depth of water should be\r\nsufficient to form a sediment layer before filtration starts, but this\r\npoint would seem to be of doubtful value, especially where the filter\r\nis not allowed to stand a considerable time with the raw water upon it\r\nbefore starting filtration.\r\n\r\nIt is also customary to have a depth of water on the filter in excess\r\nof the maximum loss of head, so that there can never be a suction in\r\nthe sand just below the sediment layer. It may be said in regard to\r\nthis, however, that a suction below is just as effective in making the\r\nwater pass the sand as an equal head above. At the Lawrence Experiment\r\nStation filters have been repeatedly used with a water depth of only\r\nfrom 6 to 12 inches, with losses of head reaching 6 feet, without the\r\nslightest inconvenience. The suction only commences to exist as the\r\nincreasing head becomes greater than the depth of water, and there is\r\nno way in which air from outside can get in to relieve it. In these\r\nexperimental filters in winter, when the water is completely saturated\r\nwith air, a small part of the air comes out of the water just as it\r\npasses the sediment layer and gets into reduced pressure, and this\r\nair prevents the satisfactory operation of the filters. But this is\r\nbelieved to be due more to the warming and consequent supersaturation\r\nof the water in the comparatively warm places in which the filters\r\nstand than to the lack of pressure, and as not the slightest trouble\r\nis experienced at other seasons of the year, it may be questioned\r\nwhether there would be any disadvantage at any time in a corresponding\r\narrangement on a large scale where warming could not occur.\r\n\r\nThe depths of water actually used in European filters with the full\r\ndepth of sand are usually from 36 to 52 inches. In only a very few\r\nunimportant cases is less than the above used, and only a few of the\r\nolder works use a greater depth, which is not followed in any of the\r\nmodern plants. As the sand becomes reduced in thickness by scraping,\r\nthe depth of water is correspondingly increased above the figures given\r\nuntil the sand is replaced. The depth of water on the German covered\r\nfilters is quite as great as upon corresponding open filters. Thus the\r\nBerlin covered filters have 51, while the new open filters at Hamburg\r\nhave only 43 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nRATE OF FILTRATION AND LOSS OF HEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rate of filtration recommended and used has been gradually reduced\r\nduring the past thirty years. In 1866 Kirkwood found that 12 vertical\r\nfeet per day, or 3.90 million gallons per acre daily, was recommended\r\nby the best engineers, and was commonly followed as an average rate.\r\nIn 1868 the London filters averaged a yield of 2.18 million gallons[8]\r\nper acre daily, including areas temporarily out of use, while in 1885\r\nthe quantity had been reduced to 1.61. Since that time the rate has\r\napparently been slightly increased.\r\n\r\nThe Berlin filters at Stralau constructed in 1874 were built to filter\r\nat a rate of 3.21 million gallons per acre daily. The first filters at\r\nTegel were built for a corresponding rate, but have been used only at\r\na rate of 2.57, while the more recent filters were calculated for this\r\nrate. The new Hamburg filters, 1892-3, were only intended to filter\r\nat a rate of 1.60 million gallons per acre daily. These in each case\r\n(except the London figures) are the standard rates for the filter-beds\r\nactually in service.\r\n\r\nIn practice the area of filters is larger than is calculated from\r\nthese figures, as filters must be built to meet maximum instead of\r\naverage daily consumptions, and a portion of the filtering area usually\r\nestimated at from 5 to 15 per cent, but in extreme cases reaching 50\r\nper cent, is usually being cleaned, and so is for the time out of\r\nservice. In some works also the rate of filtration on starting a filter\r\nis kept lower than the standard rate for a day or two, or the first\r\nportion of the effluent, supposed to be of inferior quality, is\r\n\r\nwasted, the amount so lost reaching in an extreme case 9 to 14 per\r\ncent of the total quantity of water filtered.[9] In many of the older\r\nworks also, there is not storage capacity enough for filtered water to\r\nbalance the hourly fluctuations in consumption, and the filters must be\r\nlarge enough to meet the maximum hourly as well as the maximum daily\r\nrequirements. For these reasons the actual quantity of water filtered\r\nin a year is only from 50 to 75 per cent of what would be the case if\r\nthe entire area of the filters worked constantly at the full rate. A\r\nstatement of the actual yields of a number of filter plants is given in\r\nAppendix IV. The figures for the average annual yields can be taken as\r\nquite reliable. The figures given for rate, in many cases, have little\r\nvalue, owing to the different ways in which they are calculated at\r\ndifferent places. In addition most of the old works have no adequate\r\nmeans of determining what the rate at any particular time and for a\r\nsingle filter really is, and statements of average rates have only\r\nlimited value. The filters at Hamburg are not allowed to filter faster\r\nthan 1.60 or those at Berlin faster than 2.57 million gallons per acre\r\ndaily, and adequate means are provided to secure this condition. Other\r\nGerman works aim to keep within the latter limit. Beyond this, unless\r\ndetailed information in regard to methods is presented, statements of\r\nrate must be taken with some allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF RATE UPON COST OF FILTRATION.\r\n\r\nThe size of the filters required, and consequently the first cost,\r\ndepends upon the rate of filtration, but with increasing rates the cost\r\nis not reduced in the same proportion as the increase in rate, since\r\nthe allowance for area out of use is sensibly the same for high and low\r\nrates, and in addition the operating expenses depend upon the quantity\r\nfiltered and not upon the filtering area. Thus, to supply 10 million\r\ngallons at a maximum rate of 2 million gallons per acre daily we should\r\nrequire 10 ÷ 2 = 5 acres + 1 acre reserve for cleaning = 6 acres, while\r\nwith a rate twice\r\n\r\nas great, and with the same reserve (since the same amount of cleaning\r\nmust be done, as will be shown below), we should require 10 ÷ 4 + 1\r\n= 3.5 acres, or 58 per cent of the area required for the lower rate.\r\nThus beyond a certain point increasing the rate does not effect a\r\ncorresponding reduction in the first cost.\r\n\r\nThe operating cost for the same quantity of water filtered does not\r\nappear to be appreciably affected by the rate. It is obvious that\r\nat high rates filters will became clogged more rapidly, and will\r\nso require to be scraped oftener than at low rates, and it might\r\nnaturally be supposed that the clogging would increase more rapidly\r\nthan the rates, but this does not seem to be the case. At the Lawrence\r\nExperiment Station, under strictly parallel conditions and with\r\nidentically the same water, filters running at various rates became\r\nclogged with a rapidity directly proportional to the rates, so that\r\nthe quantities of water filtered between scrapings under any given\r\nconditions are the same whether the rate is high or low.\r\n\r\nThe statistics bearing upon this point are interesting, if not entirely\r\nconclusive. There were eleven places in Germany filtering river waters,\r\nfrom which statistics were available for the year 1891-92. Of these\r\nthere were four places with high rates, Lübeck, Stettin, Stuttgart, and\r\nMagdeburg, yielding 3.70 million gallons per acre daily, which filtered\r\non an average 59 million gallons per acre between scrapings. Three\r\nother places, Breslau, Altona, and Frankfurt, yielding 1.85, passed\r\non an average 55 million gallons per acre between scrapings, and four\r\nother places, Bremen, Königsberg, Brunswick and Posen, yielding 1.34\r\nmillion gallons per acre daily, passed only 40 million gallons per\r\nacre between scrapings. The works filtering at the highest rates thus\r\nfiltered more water in proportion to the sand clogged than did those\r\nfiltering more slowly, but I cannot think that this was the result of\r\nthe rate. It is more likely that some of the places have clearer waters\r\nthan others, and that this both allows the higher rate and causes less\r\nclogging than the more turbid waters.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF RATE UPON EFFICIENCY OF FILTRATION.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the rate of filtration upon the quality of the effluent\r\nhas been repeatedly investigated. The efficiency almost uniformly\r\ndecreases rapidly with increasing rate. Fränkel and Piefke[10] first\r\nfound that with the high rates the number of bacteria passing some\r\nexperimental filters was greatly increased. Piefke[11] afterward\r\nrepeated these experiments, eliminating some of the features of the\r\nfirst series to which objection was made, and confirmed the first\r\nresults. The results were so marked that Piefke was led to recommend\r\nthe extremely low limit of 1.28 million gallons per acre daily as the\r\nsafe maximum rate of filtration, but he has since repeatedly used 2.57\r\nmillion gallons.\r\n\r\nKümmel,[12] on the other hand, in a somewhat limited series of\r\nexperiments, was unable to find any marked connection between the rate\r\nand the efficiency, a rate of 2.57 giving slightly better results than\r\nrates of either 1.28 or 5.14.\r\n\r\nThe admirably executed experiments made at Zürich in 1886-8 upon this\r\npoint, which gave throughout negative results, have but little value in\r\nthis connection, owing to the extremely low number of bacteria in the\r\noriginal water.\r\n\r\nAt Lawrence in 1892 the following percentages of bacteria (_B.\r\nprodigiosus_) passed at the respective rates:\r\n\r\n  --------+--------+-----------+---------------------------------------\r\n  No. of  | Depth. | Effective | Rate.

The 1893 results also showed\r\ndecreased efficiency with high rates, but the range in the rates\r\nunder comparable conditions was less than in 1892, and the bacterial\r\ndifferences were less sharply marked.\r\n\r\nWhile the average results at Lawrence, as well as most of the European\r\nexperiments, show greatly decreased efficiency with high rates, there\r\nare many single cases, particularly with deep layers of not too coarse\r\nsand, where, as in Kümmel’s experiments, there seems to be little\r\nconnection between the rate and efficiency. An explanation of these\r\napparently abnormal results will be given in Chapter VI.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly stated[13] that every water has its own special rate of\r\nfiltration, which must be determined by local experiments, and that\r\nthis rate may vary widely in different cases. Thus it is possible that\r\nthe rate of 1.60 adopted at Hamburg for the turbid Elbe water, the rate\r\nof 2.57 used at Berlin, and about the same at London for much clearer\r\nriver-waters, and the rate of 7.50 used at Zürich for the almost\r\nperfectly clear lake-water are in each case the most suitable for the\r\nrespective waters. In other cases however, where rates much above 2.57\r\nare used for river-waters, as at Lübeck and Stettin, there is a decided\r\nopinion that these rates are excessive, and in these instances steps\r\nare now being taken to so increase the filtering areas as to bring the\r\nrates within the limit of 2.57 million gallons per acre daily.\r\n\r\nFrom the trend of European practice it would seem that for American\r\nriver-waters the rate of filtration should not exceed 2.57 in place of\r\nthe 3.90 million gallons per acre daily recommended by Kirkwood, or\r\neven that a somewhat lower rate might be desirable in some cases. Of\r\ncourse, in addition to the area\r\n\r\nnecessary to give this rate, a reserve for fluctuating rates and for\r\ncleaning should be provided, reducing the average yield to 2.00, 1.50,\r\nor even less. In the case of water from clear lakes, ponds, or storage\r\nreservoirs, especially when they are not subject to excessive sewage\r\npollution or to strong algæ growths, it would seem that rates somewhat\r\nand perhaps in some cases very much higher (as at Zürich) could be\r\nsatisfactorily used.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOSS OF HEAD.\r\n\r\nThe loss of head is the difference between the heads of the waters\r\nabove and below the sand layer, and represents the frictional\r\nresistance of that layer. When a filter is quite free from clogging\r\nthis frictional resistance is small, but gradually increases with the\r\ndeposit of a sediment layer from the water filtered until it becomes so\r\ngreat that the clogging must be removed by scraping before the process\r\ncan be continued. After scraping the loss of head is reduced to, or\r\nnearly to, its original amount. With any given amount of clogging the\r\nloss of head is directly proportional to the rate of filtration; that\r\nis, if a filter partially clogged, filtering at a rate of 1.0, has a\r\nfrictional resistance of 0.5 ft., the resistance will be doubled by\r\nincreasing the rate to 2.00 million gallons per acre daily, provided\r\nno disturbance of the sediment layer is allowed. This law for the\r\nfrictional resistance of water in sand alone also applies to the\r\nsediment layer, as I have found by repeated tests, although in so\r\nviolent a change as that mentioned above, the utmost care is required\r\nto make the change gradually and prevent compression or breaking of the\r\nsediment layer. From this relation between the rate of filtration and\r\nthe loss of head it is seen that the regulation of either involves the\r\nregulation of the other, and it is a matter of indifference which is\r\ndirectly and which indirectly controlled.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULATION OF THE RATE AND LOSS OF HEAD IN THE OLDER FILTERS.\r\n\r\nIn the older works, and in fact in all but a few of the newest works,\r\nthe underdrains of the filters connect directly through a pipe with a\r\nsingle gate with the pure-water reservoir or pump-well, which is so\r\nbuilt that the water in it may rise nearly or quite as high as that\r\nstanding upon the filter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—SIMPLEST FORM OF REGULATION: STRALAU FILTERS AT\r\nBERLIN.]\r\n\r\nA typical arrangement of this sort was used at the Stralau works at\r\nBerlin (now discontinued), Fig. 5. With this arrangement the rate of\r\nfiltration is dependent upon the height of water in the reservoir or\r\npump-well, and so upon the varying consumption. When the water in the\r\nreceptacle falls with increasing consumption the head is increased,\r\nand with it the rate of filtration, while, on the other hand, with\r\ndecreasing draft and rising water in the reservoir, the rate of\r\nfiltration decreases and would eventually be stopped if no water were\r\nused. This very simple arrangement thus automatically, within limits,\r\nadjusts the rate of filtration to the consumption, and at the same time\r\nalways gives the highest possible level of water in the pump-well, thus\r\nalso economizing the coal required for pumping.\r\n\r\nIn plants of this type the loss of head may be measured by floats\r\non little reservoirs built for that purpose, connected with the\r\nunderdrains; but more often there is no means of determining it,\r\nalthough the maximum loss of head at any time is the difference between\r\nthe levels of the water on the filter and in the reservoir, or the\r\noutlet of the drain-pipe, in case the latter is above the water-line\r\nin the reservoir. The rate of filtration can only be measured with this\r\narrangement by shutting off the incoming water for a definite interval,\r\nand observing the distance that the water on the filter sinks. The\r\nincoming water is regulated simply by a gate, which a workman opens or\r\ncloses from time to time to hold the required height of water on the\r\nfilter.\r\n\r\nThe only possible regulation of the rate and loss of head is effected\r\nby a partial closing of the gate on the outlet-pipe, by which the\r\nfreshly-cleaned filters with nearly-closed gates are kept from\r\nfiltering more rapidly than the clogged filters, the gates of which\r\nare opened wide. Often, however, this is not done, and then the fresh\r\nfilters filter many times as rapidly as those which are partially\r\nclogged.\r\n\r\nA majority of the filters now in use are built more or less upon this\r\nplan, including most of those in London and also the Altona works,\r\nwhich had such a favorable record with cholera in 1892.\r\n\r\nThe invention and application of methods of bacterial examination in\r\nthe last years have led to different ideas of filtration from those\r\nwhich influenced the construction of the earlier plants. As a result\r\nit is now regarded as essential by most German engineers[14] that\r\neach filter shall be provided with devices for measuring accurately\r\nand at any time both the rate of filtration and the loss of head, and\r\nfor controlling them, and also for making the rate independent of\r\nconsumption by reservoirs for filtered water large enough to balance\r\nhourly variations (capacity 1/4 to 1/3 maximum daily quantity) and low\r\nenough so that they can never limit the rate of filtration by causing\r\nback-water on the filters. These points are now insisted upon by the\r\nGerman Imperial Board of Health,[15] and all new filters are built in\r\naccordance with them, while most of the old works are being built over\r\nto conform to the requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR REGULATING THE RATE AND LOSS of HEAD.\r\n\r\nMany appliances have been invented for the regulation of the rate and\r\nloss of head. In the apparatus designed by Gill and used at both Tegel\r\nand Müggel at Berlin the regulation is effected by partially closing\r\na gate through which the effluent passes into a chamber in which the\r\nwater-level is practically constant (Fig. 6). The rate is measured\r\nby the height of water on the weir which serves as the outlet for\r\nthis second chamber into a third connecting with the main reservoir,\r\nwhile the loss of head is shown by the difference in height of floats\r\nupon water in the first chamber, representing the pressure in the\r\nunderdrains, and upon water in connection with the raw water on the\r\nfilter. From the respective heights of the three floats the attendant\r\ncan at any time see the rate of filtration and the loss of head, and\r\nwhen a change is required it is effected by moving the gate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—REGULATION APPARATUS AT BERLIN (TEGEL).]\r\n\r\nIn the apparatus designed in 1866 by Kirkwood for St. Louis and never\r\nbuilt (Fig. 7) the loss of head was directly, and the rate indirectly,\r\nregulated by a movable weir, which was to have been lowered from time\r\nto time by the attendant to secure the required results. This plan is\r\nespecially remarkable as it meets the modern requirements of a regular\r\nrate independent of rate of consumption and of the water-level in the\r\nreservoir, and also allows continual measurements of both rate (height\r\nof water on the weir) and head (difference in water-levels on filter\r\nand in effluent chamber) to be made, and control of the same by the\r\nposition of the weir. Mr. Kirkwood found no filters in Europe with such\r\nappliances, and it was many years after his report was published before\r\nsimilar devices were used, but they are now regarded as essential.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—REGULATION APPARATUS AND SECTION OF FILTER\r\nRECOMMENDED FOR ST. LOUIS BY KIRKWOOD IN 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.—REGULATION APPARATUS USED AT HAMBURG.]\r\n\r\nThe regulators for new filters at Hamburg (Fig. 8) are built upon the\r\nprinciple of Kirkwood’s device, but provision is made for a second\r\nmeasurement of the water if desired by the loss of head in passing a\r\nsubmerged orifice. Both the rate and loss of head are indicated by a\r\nfloat on the first chamber connecting directly with the underdrain,\r\nwhich at the same time indicates the head on a fixed scale, the zero of\r\nwhich corresponds to the height of the water above the filter, and the\r\nrate upon a scale moving with the weir, the zero of which corresponds\r\nwith the edge of the weir. The water on the filter is held at a\r\nperfectly constant level.\r\n\r\nThe regulators in use at Worms and those recently introduced at\r\nMagdeburg act upon the same principle, but the levels of the water on\r\nthe filters are allowed to fluctuate, and the weirs and in fact, the\r\nwhole regulating appliances are mounted on big floats in surrounding\r\nchambers of water connecting with the unfiltered water on the filters.\r\nI am unable to find any advantages in these appliances, and they are\r\nmuch more complicated than the forms shown by the cuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR REGULATING THE RATE DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—LINDLEY’S REGULATION APPARATUS AT WARSAW,\r\nRUSSIA.]\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned regulators control directly the loss of head,\r\nand only indirectly the rate of filtration. The regulators at Warsaw\r\nwere designed by Lindley to regulate the rate directly and make it\r\nindependent of the loss of head. The quantity of water flowing away\r\nis regulated by a float upon the water in the effluent chamber,\r\nwhich holds the top of the telescope outlet-pipe a constant distance\r\nbelow the surface and so secures a constant rate. As the friction of\r\nthe filter increases the float sinks with the water until it reaches\r\nbottom, when the filter must be scraped. A counter-weight reduces the\r\nweight on the float, and at the same time allows a change in the rate\r\nwhen desired. This apparatus is automatic. All of the other forms\r\ndescribed require to be occasionally adjusted by the attendant, but\r\nthe attention they require is very slight, and watchmen are always on\r\nduty at large plants, who can easily watch the regulators. The Warsaw\r\napparatus is reported to work very satisfactorily, no trouble being\r\nexperienced either by leaking or sticking of the telescope-joint,\r\nwhich is obviously the weakest point of the device, but fortunately a\r\nperfectly tight joint is not essential to the success of the apparatus.\r\nRegulators acting upon the same principle have recently been installed\r\nat Zürich, where they are operating successfully.\r\n\r\nBurton[16] has described an ingenious device designed by him for the\r\nfilters at Tokyo, Japan. It consists of a double acting valve of gun\r\nmetal (similar to that shown by Fig. 11), through which the effluent\r\nmust pass. This valve is opened and closed by a rod connecting with\r\na piston in a cylinder, the opposite sides of which connect with the\r\neffluent pipe above and below a point where the latter is partially\r\nclosed, so that the valve is opened and closed according as the loss\r\nof head in passing this obstruction is below or above the amount\r\ncorresponding to the desired rate of filtration.\r\n\r\nThe use of the Venturi meter in connection with the regulation of\r\nfilters would make an interesting study, and has, I believe, never been\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REGULATOR-HOUSE, SHOWING RATE OF FILTRATION AND LOSS OF\r\nHEAD ON THE OUTSIDE, BREMEN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INLET FOR ADMISSION OF RAW WATER TO A FILTER, EAST\r\nLONDON.\r\n\r\n  [_To face page 58._]\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR REGULATING THE HEIGHT OF WATER UPON FILTERS.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by reference to the diagrams of the Berlin and Hamburg\r\neffluent regulators (Figs. 6 and 8) that their perfect operation\r\nis dependent upon the maintenance of a constant water-level upon\r\nthe filters. The old-fashioned adjustment of the inlet-gate by the\r\nattendant is hardly accurate enough.\r\n\r\nThe first apparatus for accurately and automatically regulating the\r\nlevel of the water upon the filters was constructed at Leeuwarden,\r\nHolland, by the engineer, Mr. Halbertsma, who has since used a similar\r\ndevice at other places, and improved forms of which are now used at\r\nBerlin and at Hamburg.\r\n\r\nAt Berlin (Müggel) the water-level is regulated by a float upon the\r\nwater in the filter which opens or shuts a balanced double valve on\r\nthe inlet-pipe directly beneath, as shown in Fig. 10. It is not at all\r\nnecessary that this valve should shut water-tight; it is only necessary\r\nthat it should prevent the continuous inflow from becoming so great as\r\nto raise the water-level, and for this reason loose, easily-working\r\njoints are employed. The apparatus is placed in a little pit next to\r\nthe side of the filter, and the overflowing water is prevented from\r\nwashing the sand by paving the sand around it for a few feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—REGULATION OF INFLOW USED AT MÜGGEL, BERLIN.]\r\n\r\nAt Hamburg the same result is obtained by putting the valve in a\r\nspecial chamber outside of the filter and connected with the float by a\r\nwalking-beam (Fig. 11).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—REGULATION OF INFLOW USED AT HAMBURG.]\r\n\r\nThe various regulators require to be protected from cold and ice by\r\nspecial houses, except in the case of covered filters, where they can\r\nusually be arranged with advantage in the filter itself. In regard to\r\nthe choice of the form of regulator for both the inlets and outlets of\r\nfilters, so far as I have been able to ascertain, each of the modern\r\nforms described as in use performs its functions satisfactorily, and in\r\nspecial cases any of them could properly be selected which would in the\r\nlocal conditions be the simplest in construction and operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMIT TO THE LOSS OF HEAD.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the loss of head is allowed to go before filters\r\nare cleaned differs widely in the different works, some of the newer\r\nworks limiting it sharply because it is believed that low bacterial\r\nefficiency results when the pressure is too great, although the\r\nfrequency of cleaning and consequently the cost of operation are\r\nthereby increased.\r\n\r\nAt Darlington, England, I believe as a result of the German theories,\r\nthe loss of head is limited to about 18 inches by a masonry weir built\r\nwithin the last few years. At Berlin, both at Tegel and Müggel, the\r\nlimit is 24 inches, while at the new Hamburg works 28 inches are\r\nallowed. At Stralau in 1893 an effort was made to not exceed a limit\r\nof 40 inches, but previously heads up to 60 inches were used, which\r\ncorresponds with the 56 inches used at Altona; and, in the other old\r\nworks, while exact information is not easily obtained because of\r\nimperfect records, I am convinced that heads of 60 or even 80 inches\r\nare not uncommon. At the Lawrence Experiment Station heads of 70 inches\r\nhave generally been used, although some filters have been limited to 36\r\nand 24 inches.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 Kirkwood became convinced that the loss of head should not go\r\nmuch above 30 inches, first, because high heads would, by bringing\r\nextra weight upon the sand, make it too compact, and, second, because\r\nwhen the pressure became too great the sediment layer on the surface of\r\nthe sand, in which most of the loss of head occurs, would no longer be\r\nable to support the weight and, becoming broken, would allow the water\r\nto pour through the comparatively large resulting openings at greatly\r\nincreased rates and with reduced efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the first point, a straight, even pressure many times\r\nthat of the water on the filter is incapable of compressing the sand.\r\nIt is much more the effect of the boots of the workmen when scraping\r\nthat makes the sand compact. I have found sand in natural banks at\r\nLawrence 70 or 80 feet below the surface, where it had been subjected\r\nto corresponding pressure for thousands of years, to be quite as porous\r\nas when packed in water in experimental filters in the usual way.\r\n\r\nThe second reason mentioned, or, as I may call it, the breaking-through\r\ntheory, is very generally if not universally accepted by German\r\nengineers, and this is the reason for the low limit commonly adopted by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA careful study of the results at Lawrence fails to show the slightest\r\ndeterioration of the effluents up to the limit used, 72 inches. Thus\r\nin 1892, taking only the results of the continuous filters of full\r\nheight (Nos. 33A, 34A, 36A, and 37), we find that for the three days\r\nbefore scraping, when the head was nearly 72 inches, the average\r\nnumber of bacteria in the effluents was 31 per cc., while for the\r\nthree days after scraping, with very low heads, the number was 47. The\r\ncorresponding numbers of _B. prodigiosus_[17] were 1.1 and 2.7. This\r\nshows better work with the highest heads, but is open to the objection\r\nthat the period just after scraping, owing to the disturbance of the\r\nsurface, is commonly supposed to be a period of low efficiency.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this criticism in calculating the corresponding results for\r\n1893, the numbers of the bacteria for the intermediate days which could\r\nnot have been influenced either by scraping or by excessive head are\r\nput side by side with the others. Taking these results as before for\r\ncontinuous filters 72 inches high, and excluding those with extremely\r\nfine sands and a filter which was only in operation a short time toward\r\nthe end of the year, we obtain the following results:\r\n\r\n                                                    Water        B.\r\n                                                   Bacteria  Prodigiosus\r\n                                                    per cc.    per cc.\r\n  Average 1st day after scraping, low heads           79         6.1\r\n  Average 2d  day after scraping, low heads           44         4.1\r\n  Average 3d  day after scraping, low heads           45         3.6\r\n  Intermediate days, medium heads                     59         4.5\r\n  Second from last day, heads of nearly 72 inches     66         2.7\r\n  Next to the last day, heads of nearly 72 inches     56         3.2\r\n  Last day,             heads of nearly 72 inches     83         2.5\r\n\r\nThese figures show a very slight increase of the water bacteria in the\r\neffluent as the head approaches the limit, but no such increase as\r\nmight be expected from a breaking through of the sediment layer, and\r\nthe _B. prodigiosus_ which is believed to better indicate the removal\r\nof the bacteria of the original water, actually shows a decrease, the\r\nlast day being the best day of the whole period.\r\n\r\nThe Lawrence results, then, uniformly and clearly point to a conclusion\r\ndirectly opposite to the commonly accepted view, and I have thus\r\nbeen led to examine somewhat closely the grounds upon which the\r\nbreaking-through theory rests.\r\n\r\nThe two works which have perhaps contributed most to the theories\r\nof filtration are the Stralau and Altona works. After examining the\r\navailable records of these works, I am quite convinced that at these\r\nplaces there has been, at times at least, decreased efficiency with\r\nhigh heads. For the Stralau works this is well shown by Piefke’s\r\nplates in the _Zeitschrift für Hygiene_, 1894, after page 188. In both\r\nof these works, however, the apparatus (or lack of apparatus) for\r\nregulating the rate is that shown by Fig. 5, page 49, and the rate\r\nof filtration is thus dependent upon the rate of consumption and the\r\nheight of water in the reservoir. At the Stralau works, at the time\r\ncovered by the above-mentioned diagrams, the daily quantity of water\r\nfiltered was 27 times the capacity of the reservoir, and the rate\r\nof filtration must consequently have adapted itself to the hourly\r\nconsumptions. The data which formed the basis of Kirkwood’s conclusions\r\nare not given in detail, but it is quite safe to assume that they were\r\nobtained from filters regulated as those at Altona and Stralau are\r\nregulated, and what is said in regard to the latter will apply equally\r\nto his results.\r\n\r\nPiefke[18] shows that among the separate filters at Stralau, all\r\nconnected with the same pure-water reservoir, those connected through\r\nthe shorter pipes gave poorer effluents than the more remote filters,\r\nand he attributes the difference to the frictional resistance of the\r\nconnecting pipes, which helped to prevent excessive rates in the\r\nfilters farthest away when the water in the reservoir became low, and\r\nthus the fluctuations in the rates in these filters were less than in\r\nthose close to the reservoir. He\r\n\r\ndoes not, however, notice, in speaking of the filters in which the\r\ndecreased efficiencies with high heads were specially marked, that they\r\nfollow in nearly the same order, and that of the four open filters\r\nmentioned three were near the reservoir and only one was separated by\r\na comparatively long pipe, indicating that the deterioration with high\r\nheads was only noticeable, or at least was much more conspicuous, in\r\nthose filters where the rates fluctuated most violently.\r\n\r\nIt requires no elaborate calculation to show that of two filters\r\nconnected with the same pure-water reservoir, as shown by Fig. 5,\r\nwith only simple gates on the connecting pipes, one of them clean and\r\nthrottled by a nearly closed gate, so that the normal pressure behind\r\nthe gate is above the highest level of water in the reservoir, and the\r\nother clogged so that the normal pressure of the water in the drain is\r\nconsiderably below the highest level of the water in the reservoir,\r\nthe latter will suffer much the more severe shocks with fluctuating\r\nwater-levels; and the fact being admitted that fluctuating levels are\r\nunfavorable, we must go farther and conclude that the detrimental\r\naction will increase with increasing loss of head. I am inclined to\r\nthink that this theory is adequate to explain the Stralau and Altona\r\nresults without resource to the breaking-through theory.\r\n\r\nWhile the above does not at all prove the breaking-through theory to be\r\nfalse, it explains the results upon which it rests in another way, and\r\ncan hardly fail to throw so much doubt upon it as to make us refuse to\r\nallow its application to those works where a regular rate of filtration\r\nis maintained regardless of variations in the consumption, until proof\r\nis furnished that it is applicable to them.\r\n\r\nI have been totally unable to find satisfactory European results in\r\nregard to this point. The English works can furnish nothing, both on\r\naccount of the lack of regulating appliances and because the monthly\r\nbacterial examinations are inadequate for a discussion of hourly or\r\ndaily changes. The results from the older Continental works are also\r\nexcluded for one or the other, or more often for both, of the above\r\nreasons. The Hamburg, Tegel, and Müggel results, so far as they go,\r\nshow no deterioration with increased heads, but the heads are limited\r\nto 24 or 28 inches by the construction of the filters, and the results\r\nthus entirely fail to show what would be obtained with heads more than\r\ntwice as high.\r\n\r\nI am thus forced to conclude that there is no adequate evidence of\r\ninferior efficiency with high heads in filters where the rates are\r\nindependent of the water-level in the pure-water reservoir, the\r\nonly results directly to the point—the Lawrence results mentioned\r\nabove—indicating that the full efficiency is maintained with heads\r\nreaching at least 72 inches.\r\n\r\nThe principal reason for desiring to allow a considerable loss of head\r\nis an economical one; the period will then be lengthened, while the\r\nfrequency of scraping and the volume of sand to be washed and replaced\r\nwill be correspondingly reduced. There may be other advantages in long\r\nperiods, such as less trouble with scraping and better work in cold\r\nwinter weather, but the cost is the most important consideration.\r\n\r\nIt is the prevalent idea among the German engineers that the loss of\r\nhead after reaching 24 to 30 inches would increase very rapidly, so\r\nthat the quantity of water filtered, in case a much higher head was\r\nallowed, would not be materially increased. No careful investigations,\r\nhowever, have been made, and indeed they are hardly possible with\r\nexisting arrangements, as in the older filters the loss of head\r\nfluctuates with varying rates of filtration in such a way that only\r\nresults of very doubtful value can be obtained, and in the newer works\r\nthe loss of head is too closely limited, and the curves which can be\r\ndrawn by extrapolation are evidently no safe indications of what would\r\nactually happen if the process was carried farther.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I was told by the attendant at Darlington, England,\r\nthat since the building of the weir a few years ago, which now limits\r\nthe loss of head to about 18 inches instead of the 5 feet or more\r\nformerly used, the quantity of sand to be removed has been three times\r\nas great as formerly. No records are kept, and this can only be given\r\nas the general impression of the man who superintends the work.\r\n\r\nAt Lawrence the average quantities of water filtered between scrapings\r\nwith sand of an effective size of 0.20 mm. have been as follows:\r\n\r\n  Maximum Loss of  Million Gallons per Acre filtered\r\n  Head.            between Scrapings.\r\n\r\n                   1892. 1893.  Average.\r\n\r\n  70 inches          58    88     73\r\n  34  foot           32    22     27\r\n  22  foot           17    16     16\r\n\r\nWith sand of an effective size of 0.29 mm. the results were:\r\n\r\n                  1893.\r\n\r\n  70 inches         70\r\n  22  foot          29\r\n\r\nThese results indicate a great increase in the quantity of water\r\nfiltered between scrapings with increasing heads, the figures being\r\nnearly proportional to the maximum heads used in the respective\r\ncases. It is, of course, quite possible that the results would differ\r\nin different places with the character of the raw water and of the\r\nfiltering material.\r\n\r\nThe depth of sand to be removed by scraping at one time is, within\r\nlimits, practically independent of the quantity of dirt which it has\r\naccumulated, and any lengthening of the period means a corresponding\r\nreduction in the quantity of sand to be removed, washed and replaced\r\nand consequently an important reduction in the operating cost, as well\r\nas a reduction in the area of filters out of use while being cleaned,\r\nand so, in the capital cost.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor objections to an increased loss of head are the\r\ngreater head against which the water must be pumped, and the possible\r\nincreased difficulty of filling filters with filtered water from below\r\nafter scraping, but these would hardly have much weight against the\r\neconomy indicated by the Lawrence experiments for the higher heads.\r\n\r\nHigh heads will also drive an increased quantity of water through any\r\ncracks or passages in the filter. Such leaks have at last been found to\r\nbe the cause of the inferior work of the covered filters at Stralau,\r\nthe water going down unfiltered in certain corners, especially at high\r\nheads; but with careful construction there should be no cracks, and\r\nwith the aid of bacteriology to find the possible leaks this ought not\r\nto be a valid objection.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion: the trend of opinion is strongly in favor of limiting\r\nthe loss of head to about 24 to 30 inches as was suggested by Kirkwood,\r\nbut I am forced to conclude that there is reason to believe that\r\nequally good results can be obtained with lower operating expenses by\r\nallowing higher heads to be used, at least in the case of filters with\r\nmodern regulating appliances, and, I would suggest that filters should\r\nbe built so as not to exclude the use of moderately high heads, and\r\nthat the limit to be permanently used should be determined by actual\r\ntests of efficiency and length of period with various losses of head\r\nafter starting the works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCLEANING FILTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a filter has become so far clogged that it will no longer pass\r\na satisfactory quantity of water with the allowable head it must be\r\ncleaned by scraping off and removing the upper layer of dirty sand.\r\n\r\nTo do this without unnecessary loss of time the unfiltered water\r\nstanding upon the filter is removed by a drain above the sand provided\r\nfor that purpose. The water in the sand must then be lowered below the\r\nsurface of the sand by drawing water from the underdrains until the\r\nsand is firm enough to bear the weight of the workmen. By the time\r\nthat this is accomplished the last water on the surface should have\r\nsoaked away, and the filter is ready to be scraped. This is done by\r\nworkmen with wide, sharp shovels, and the sand removed is taken to\r\nthe sand-washing apparatus to be washed and used again. Special pains\r\nare given to securing rapid and cheap transportation of the sand. In\r\nsome cases it is wheeled out of the filter on an inclined plane to the\r\nwasher. In other cases a movable crane is provided which lifts the sand\r\nin special receptacles and allows it to fall into cars on a tram-line\r\non which the crane also moves. The cars as filled are run to the washer\r\nand also serve to bring back the washed sand. When the dirty sand has\r\nbeen removed, the surface of the sand is carefully smoothed and raked.\r\nThis is especially necessary to remove the effects of the workmen’s\r\nboots.\r\n\r\nIt is customary in the most carefully managed works to fill the sand\r\nwith filtered water from below, introduced through the underdrains. In\r\ncase the ordinary level of the water in the pure-water canal is higher\r\nthan the surface of the sand in the filters, this is accomplished\r\nby simply opening a gate provided for the purpose, which allows the\r\nwater to pass around the regulating apparatus. Otherwise filters can\r\nbe filled from a special pipe taking its water from any filter which\r\nat that time can deliver its effluent high enough for that purpose.\r\nThe quantity of water required for filling the sand from below is\r\nordinarily but a fraction of one per cent of the quantity filtered.\r\n\r\nFormerly, instead of filling from below, after cleaning, the raw water\r\nwas brought directly onto the surface of the filter. This was said to\r\nonly imperfectly fill the sand-pores, which still contained much air.\r\nIf, however, the water is not brought on too rapidly it will sink into\r\nthe sand near the point where it is applied, pass laterally through the\r\nsand or underlying gravel to other parts of the filter, and then rise,\r\nso that even in this case all but a little of the filter will be really\r\nfilled from below. This is, however, open to the objection that however\r\nslowly the water is introduced, the sand which absorbs it around the\r\ninlet filters it at a very high rate and presumably imperfectly, so\r\nthat the water in the underdrains at the start will be poor quality\r\nand the sand around the inlet will be unduly clogged. The practice of\r\nfilling from below is therefore well founded.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the surface of the sand is covered with the water from\r\nbelow, raw water is introduced from above, filling the filter to\r\nthe standard height, care being taken at first that no currents\r\nare produced which might wash the surface of the sand. It has been\r\nrecommended by Piefke and others that this water should be allowed\r\nto stand for a time up to twenty-four hours before starting the\r\nfiltration, to allow the formation of a sediment layer, and in some\r\nplaces, especially at Berlin and the works of some of the London\r\ncompanies, this is done; but varying importance is attached to the\r\nprocedure, and it is invariably omitted, so far as I can learn, when\r\nthe demand for water is heavy.\r\n\r\nThe depth of sand removed by scraping must at least equal the\r\ndepth of the discolored layer, but there is no sharp dividing line,\r\nthe impurities gradually decreasing from the surface downward.\r\nFig. 12 shows the relative number of bacteria found in the sand at\r\nvarious depths in one of the Lawrence experimental filters, and is a\r\nrepresentative result, although the actual numbers vary at different\r\ntimes. In general it may be said that the bulk of the sediment is\r\nretained in the upper quarter inch, but it is desirable to remove also\r\nthe less dirty sand below and, in fact, it is apparently impossible\r\nwith the method of scraping in use to remove so thin a layer as one\r\nfourth inch. Practically the depth to which sand is removed is stated\r\nto be from 0.40 to 1.20 inch. Exact statistics are not easily obtained,\r\nbut I think that 2 centimeters or 0.79 inch may be safely taken as\r\nabout the average depth usually removed in European filters, and it is\r\nthis depth which is indicated on Fig. 12.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—DIAGRAM SHOWING ACCUMULATION OF BACTERIA NEAR\r\nTHE SURFACE OF THE SAND.]\r\n\r\nAt the Lawrence Experiment Station, the depth removed is often much\r\nless than this, and depends upon the size of grain of the sand\r\nemployed, the coarser sands requiring to be more deeply scraped than\r\nthe finer ones. The method of scraping, however, which allows the\r\nremoval of very thin sand layers, is only possible because of the\r\nsmall size of the filters, and as it is incapable of application on a\r\nlarge scale, the depths thus removed are only interesting as showing\r\nthe results which might be obtained in practice with a more perfect\r\nmethod of scraping.\r\n\r\nThe replacing of the washed sand is usually delayed until the filter\r\nhas been scraped quite a number of times—commonly for a year. The last\r\nscraping before refilling is much deeper than usual, because the sand\r\nbelow the depth of the ordinary scraping is somewhat dirty, and might\r\ncause trouble if left below the clean sand.\r\n\r\nIn England it is the usual if not the universal practice to replace the\r\nwashed sand at the bottom between the old sand and the gravel. This is\r\ndone by digging up the entire filter in sections about six feet wide.\r\nThe old sand in the first section is removed clear down to the gravel,\r\nand the depth of washed sand which is to be replaced is put in its\r\nplace. The old sand from the next six-foot section is then shovelled\r\nupon the first section of clean sand, and its place is in turn filled\r\nwith fresh sand. With this practice the workmen’s boots are likely to\r\ndisturb the gravel each year, necessitating a thicker layer of the\r\nupper and finest grade than would otherwise be required.\r\n\r\nIn Germany this is also sometimes done, but more frequently the upper\r\nlayer of slightly clogged sand below the regular scraping is removed\r\nas far as the slightest discoloration can be seen, perhaps 6 inches\r\ndeep. The sand below is loosened for another 6 inches and allowed to\r\nstand dry, if possible, for some days; afterwards the washed sand is\r\nbrought on and placed above. The washed sand is never replaced without\r\nsome such treatment, because the slightly clogged sand below the layer\r\nremoved would act as if finer than the freshly washed sand,[19] and\r\nthere would be a tendency to sub-surface clogging.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREQUENCY OF SCRAPING.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of scraping depends upon the character of the raw water,\r\nthe thoroughness of the preliminary sedimentation, the grain-size of\r\nthe filter sand, the rate of filtration, and the maximum loss of head\r\nallowed. With suitable conditions the period between scrapings should\r\nnever be less than one week, and will but rarely exceed two months.\r\nUnder exceptional conditions, however, periods have been recorded as\r\nlow as one day and as high as one hundred and ten days. Periods of less\r\nthan a week’s duration are almost conclusive evidence that something\r\nis radically wrong, and the periods of one day mentioned were actually\r\naccompanied by very inadequate filtration. In 1892 the average periods\r\nat the German works varied from 9.5 days at Stettin (with an excessive\r\nrate) to 40 days at Brunswick, the average of all being 25 days.[20]\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water per acre filtered between scrapings forms the\r\nmost convenient basis for calculation. The effect of rate (page\r\n49), loss of head (page 65), and size of sand grain (page 32) have\r\nalready been discussed, and it will suffice to say here that the total\r\nquantity filtered between scrapings is apparently independent of the\r\nrate of filtration, but varies with the maximum loss of head and with\r\nthe grain-size of the sand, and apparently nearly in proportion to\r\nthem. Eleven German filter-works in 1892, drawing their waters from\r\nrivers, filtered on an average 51 million gallons of water per acre\r\nbetween scrapings, the single results ranging from 28 at Bremen to 71\r\nat Stuttgart, while Zürich, drawing its water from a lake which is\r\nbut very rarely turbid, filtered 260 million gallons per acre between\r\nscrapings. Unfortunately, the quantities at Berlin, where (in 1892 two\r\nthirds and now all) the water is drawn from comparatively large ponds\r\non the rivers, are not available for comparison.\r\n\r\nAt London, in 1884, the average quantities of water filtered\r\n\r\nbetween scrapings varied from 43 to 136 million gallons per acre with\r\nthe different companies, averaging 85, and in 1892 the quantities\r\nranged from 73 to 157, averaging 90 million gallons per acre. The\r\ngreater quantity filtered at London may be due to the greater sizes of\r\nthe sedimentation-basins, which for all the companies together hold a\r\nnine days’ supply at London against probably less than one day’s supply\r\nfor the German works.\r\n\r\nThere is little information available in regard to the frequency\r\nof scraping with water drawn from impounding reservoirs. In some\r\nexperiments made by Mr. FitzGerald at the Chestnut Hill reservoir,\r\nBoston, the results of which are as yet unpublished, a filter with\r\nsand of an effective size of only .09 mm. averaged 58 million gallons\r\nper acre between scrapings for nine periods, the rate of filtration\r\nbeing 1.50 million gallons per acre daily, while another filter, with\r\nsand of an effective size of .18 mm., passed an average of 93 million\r\ngallons per acre for ten periods at the same rate. These experiments\r\nextended through all seasons of the year, and taking into account the\r\ncomparative fineness of the sands they show rather high quantities of\r\nwater filtered between scrapings.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water filtered between scrapings is usually greatest\r\nin winter, owing to the smaller quantity of sediment in the raw water\r\nat this season, and is lowest in times of flood, regardless of season.\r\nIn summer the quantity is often reduced to a very low figure in waters\r\nsupporting algæ growths, especially when the filters are not covered.\r\nThus at Stralau in 1893 during the algæ period the quantity was reduced\r\nto 14 million gallons per acre for open filters,[21] but this was quite\r\nexceptional, the much-polluted, though comparatively clear, Spree water\r\nfurnishing unusually favorable conditions for the algæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUANTITY OF SAND TO BE REMOVED.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the quantity of sand to be removed and washed, if we\r\ntake the average result given above for the German works filtering\r\nriver-waters of 51,000,000 gallons per acre filtered between scrapings,\r\nand the depth of sand removed at two centimeters or 0.79 inch, we\r\nfind that one volume of sand is required for every 2375 volumes of\r\nwater filtered, or 2.10 cubic yards per million gallons. At Bremen,\r\nthe highest average result, the quantity would be 3.80 yards, and at\r\nStralau during the algæ season 7.70 yards. At Zürich, on the other\r\nhand, the quantity is only 0.41 yard, and at London, with 87,000,000\r\ngallons per acre filtered between scrapings, the quantity of sand\r\nwashed would be 1.24 yards per million gallons; assuming always that\r\nthe layer removed is 0.79 inch thick.\r\n\r\nThese estimates are for the regular scrapings only, and do not include\r\nthe annual deeper scraping before replacing the sand, which would\r\nincrease them by about one third.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASTING THE EFFLUENTS AFTER SCRAPING.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that an important part of the filtration\r\ntakes place in the sediment layer deposited on top of the sand from\r\nthe water. When this layer is removed by scraping its influence is\r\ntemporarily removed, and reduced efficiency of filtration may result.\r\nThe significance of this reduced efficiency became apparent when the\r\nbacteria in the water were studied in their relations to disease, and\r\nPiefke suggested[22] that the first effluent after scraping should\r\nbe rejected for one day after ordinary scrapings and for one week\r\nafter replacing the sand. In a more recent paper[23] he reduces these\r\nestimates to the first million gallons of water per acre filtered after\r\nscraping\r\n\r\nfor open and twice as great a quantity for covered filters, and to six\r\ndays after replacing the sand, which last he estimates will occur only\r\nonce a year. Taking the quantity of water filtered between scrapings at\r\n13.9 million gallons per acre, the quantity observed at Stralau in the\r\nsummer of 1893, he finds that it is necessary to waste 9 per cent of\r\nthe total quantity of effluent from open and 13.8 per cent of that from\r\ncovered filters.\r\n\r\nThe eleven German water-works[24] filtering river-waters, however,\r\nfiltered on an average 51.0 instead of 13.9 million gallons per acre\r\nbetween scrapings, and applying Piefke’s figures to them the quantities\r\nof water to be wasted would be only about one fourth of his estimates\r\nfor Stralau.\r\n\r\nThe rules of the Imperial Board of Health[25] require that every German\r\nfilter shall be so constructed “that when an inferior effluent results\r\nit can be disconnected from the pure-water pipes and the filtrate\r\nallowed to be wasted.” The drain-pipe for removing the rejected water\r\nshould be connected below the apparatus for regulating the rate and\r\nloss of head, so that the filter can be operated exactly as usual,\r\nand the effluent can be turned back to the pure-water pipes without\r\nstopping or changing the rate. The works at Berlin and at Hamburg\r\nconform to this requirement, and most of the older German works have\r\nbeen or are being built over to make them do so.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the extent of deterioration after scraping, Piefke’s\r\nexperiments have always shown much larger numbers of bacteria both of\r\nthe ordinary forms and of special applied forms on the first day after\r\nscraping, the numbers frequently being many times as high as at other\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nAt the Lawrence Experiment Station it was found in 1892 that on an\r\naverage the number of water bacteria was increased by 70 per cent\r\n(continuous filters only) for the three days following scraping, while\r\n_B. prodigiosus_ when applied was increased 140 per\r\n\r\ncent, the increase being most marked where the depth of sand was\r\nleast, and with the highest rate of filtration.\r\n\r\nThe same tendency was found in 1893, when the increase in the water\r\nbacteria on the first day after scraping was only 19 per cent and _B.\r\nprodigiosus_ 64 per cent, but for a portion of the year the difference\r\nwas greater, averaging 132 and 262 per cent, respectively. These\r\ndifferences are much less than those recorded by Piefke, and with the\r\nhigh efficiencies regularly obtained at Lawrence they would hardly\r\njustify the expensive practice of wasting the effluent.\r\n\r\nThe reduction in efficiency following scraping is much less at low\r\nrates, and if a filter is started at much less than its normal rate\r\nafter scraping, and then gradually increased to the standard after\r\nthe sediment layer is formed, the poor work will be largely avoided.\r\nPractically this is done at Berlin and at Hamburg. The filters are\r\nstarted at a fourth or less of the usual rates and are gradually\r\nincreased, as past experience with bacterial results has shown it can\r\nbe safely done, and the effluent is then even at first so well purified\r\nthat it need not be wasted.\r\n\r\nPractically in building new filters the provision of a suitable\r\nconnection for wasting the effluents into the drain which is necessary\r\nfor emptying them involves no serious expense and should be provided,\r\nbut it may be questioned how often it should be used for wasting the\r\neffluents. If the raw water is so bad that a good effluent cannot be\r\nobtained by careful manipulation even just after scraping, the course\r\nof the Berlin authorities in closing the Stralau works and seeking a\r\nless polluted supply would seem to be the only really safe procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAND-WASHING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLEANING A FILTER, EAST LONDON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHING DIRTY SAND WITH HOSE, ANTWERP.]\r\n\r\n  [_To face page 76._]\r\n\r\nThe sand-washing apparatus is an important part of most European\r\nfiltering plants. It seldom happens that a natural sand can be found\r\nclean enough and sufficiently free from fine particles although such\r\na sand was found and used for the Lawrence filter. Most of the sand in\r\nuse for filtration in Europe was originally washed. In the operation of\r\nthe filters also, sand-washing is used for the dirty sand, which can\r\nthen be used over and over at a much lower cost than would be the case\r\nif fresh sand was used for refilling. The methods used for washing sand\r\nat the different works present a great variety both in their details\r\nand in the underlying principles. Formerly boxes with double perforated\r\nbottoms in which the sand was placed and stirred by a man as water from\r\nbelow rose through them, and other similar arrangements were commonly\r\nused, but they are at present only retained, so far as I know, in some\r\nof the smaller English works. The cleansing obtained is apparently\r\nconsiderably less thorough than with some of the modern devices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.—HOSE-WASHING FOR DIRTY SAND.]\r\n\r\nHose-washing is used in London by the Southwark and Vauxhall, Lambeth\r\nand Chelsea companies, and also at Antwerp. For this a platform is\r\nconstructed about 15 feet long by 8 feet wide, with a pitch lengthwise\r\nof 6 to 8 inches (Fig. 13). The platform is surrounded by a wall\r\nrising from one foot at the bottom to three feet high at the top,\r\nexcept the lower end, which is closed by a removable plank weir 5 or 6\r\ninches high. From two to four cubic yards of the sand are placed upon\r\nthis platform and a stream of water from a hose with a 3/4 or 7/8-inch\r\nnozzle is played upon it, moving it about from place to place. The sand\r\nitself is always kept toward the upper end of the platform, while the\r\nwater with the dirt removed flows down into the pond made by the weir,\r\nwhere the sand settles out and the dirt overflows with the water. When\r\nthe water comes off clear, which is usually after an hour or a little\r\nless, the weir is removed, and, after draining, the sand is removed.\r\nThese arrangements are built in pairs so that the hose can be used in\r\none while the sand is being changed in the other. They are usually\r\nbuilt of brick laid in cement, but plank and iron are also used. The\r\ncorners are sometimes carried out square as in the figure, but are more\r\noften rounded. The washing is apparently fairly well done.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the so-called “drum” washing-machine, drawings of which have\r\nbeen several times published,[26] has come to be almost universally\r\nused. It consists of a large revolving cylinder, on the bottom of the\r\ninside of which the sand is slowly pushed up toward the higher end by\r\nendless screw-blades attached to the cylinder, while water is freely\r\nplayed upon it all the way. The machine requires a special house for\r\nits accommodation and from 2 to 4 horse-power for its operation. It\r\nwashes from 2.5 to 4 yards of sand per hour most thoroughly, with a\r\nconsumption of from 11 to 14 times as large a volume of water. The\r\napparatus is not patented or made for sale, but full plans can be\r\neasily secured.\r\n\r\nA machine made by Samuel Pegg & Sons, Leicester, Eng., pushes the\r\nsand up a slight incline down which water flows. It is very heavy and\r\nrequires power to operate it. The patent has\r\n\r\nexpired. A machine much like it but lighter and more convenient and\r\nmoved by water-power derived from the water used for washing instead of\r\nsteam-power is used at Zürich with good results.\r\n\r\nIn Greenway’s machine the sand is forced by a screw through a long\r\nnarrow cylinder in which there is a current of water in the opposite\r\ndirection. The power required is furnished by a water-motor, as with\r\nthe machine at Zürich. The apparatus is mounted on wheels and is\r\nportable; it has an appliance for piling up the washed sand or loading\r\nit onto cars. It is patented and is manufactured by James Gibb & Co.,\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the London water companies are now using ejector washers,\r\nand such an apparatus has been placed by the side of the “drum” washers\r\nat Hamburg. This apparatus was made by Körting Brothers in Hannover,\r\nand combines the ejectors long made by that firm with hoppers from\r\ndesigns by Mr. Bryan, engineer of the East London Water Company. An\r\napparatus differing from this only in the shape of the ejectors and\r\nsome minor details has been patented in England, and is for sale by\r\nMessrs. Hunter, Frazer & Goodman, Bow, London.\r\n\r\nBoth of these forms consist of a series of conical hoppers, from the\r\nbottom of each of which the sand and water are forced into the top of\r\nthe next by means of ejectors, the excess of dirty water overflowing\r\nfrom the top of each hopper. The apparatus is compact and not likely\r\nto get out of order, but is not portable. It can be easily arranged to\r\ntake the sand at the level of the ground, or even lower if desired, and\r\ndeliver it washed at some little elevation, thus minimizing hand-labor.\r\nThe washing is regular and thorough. The objection most frequently\r\nraised against its use is the quantity of water required, but at\r\nHamburg I was informed that the volume of water required was only about\r\n15 times that of the sand, while almost as much (13-14 volumes) were\r\nrequired for the “drum” washers, and the saving in power much more\r\nthan offset the extra cost for water.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above processes of sand-washing, Piefke’s method\r\nof cleaning without scraping[27] might be mentioned, although as\r\nyet it has hardly passed the experimental stage, and has only been\r\nused on extremely small filters. The process consists of stirring\r\nthe surface sand of the filter with “waltzers” while a thin sheet of\r\nwater rapidly flows over the surface. This arrangement necessitates a\r\nspecial construction of the filters, providing for rapidly removing\r\nthe unfiltered water from the surface, and for producing a regular and\r\nrapid movement of a thin sheet of water over the surface. In the little\r\nfilters now in use, one of which I saw in a brewery in Berlin, the\r\ncleaning is rapidly, cheaply, and apparently well done.\r\n\r\nIn washing dirty sand it is obvious that any small sand-grains will\r\nbe removed with the dirt, and in washing new sand the main object is\r\nto remove the grains below a certain size. It is also apparent that\r\nthe sizes of grains which will and those which will not be removed\r\nare dependent upon the mechanical arrangements of the washer, as, for\r\nexample, with the ejectors, upon the sizes of the hoppers, and the\r\nquantity of water passing through them, and care should be taken to\r\nmake them correspond with the size of grain selected for the filter\r\nsand. This can only be done by experiment, as no results are available\r\non this point.\r\n\r\nIn some places filtered water is used for sand-washing, although this\r\nseems quite unnecessary, as ordinary river-water answers very well.\r\nIt is, however, often cheaper, especially in small works, to use the\r\nfiltered water from the mains rather than provide a separate supply for\r\nthe washers.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water required for washing may be estimated at 15 times\r\nthe volume of the sand and the sand as 0.04 per cent of the volume of\r\nthe water filtered (page 74), so that\r\n\r\n0.6 per cent of the total quantity of water filtered will be required\r\nfor sand-washing.\r\n\r\nThe cost of sand-washing in Germany with the “drum” washers is said\r\nto be from 14 to 20 cents per cubic yard, including labor, power, and\r\nwater. In America the water would cost no more, but the labor would be\r\nperhaps twice as dear. With an ejector apparatus I should estimate the\r\ncost of washing dirty sand as follows: The sand would be brought and\r\ndumped near to the washer, and one man could easily feed it in, as no\r\nlifting is required. Two men would probably be required to shovel the\r\nwashed sand into barrows or carts with the present arrangements, but I\r\nthink with a little ingenuity this handling could be made easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nESTIMATED COST OF OPERATING EJECTOR WASHERS 9 HOURS.\r\n\r\n  Wages of 3 men at $2.00                            $6.00\r\n  110,000 gals, water (15 times the volume of sand)\r\n    at 0.05 a thousand gals.                          5.50\r\n                                                     -----\r\n  Total cost of washing 36 cubic yards              $11.50\r\n    or 32 cents a cubic yard.\r\n\r\nThe cost of washing new sand might be somewhat less. The other costs of\r\ncleaning filters, scraping, transporting, and replacing the sand are\r\nmuch greater than the washing itself. Lindley states that at Warsaw 29\r\ndays’ labor of 10 hours for one man are required to scrape an acre of\r\nfilter surface, and four times as much for the annual deep scraping,\r\ndigging up, and replacing the sand. The first expense occurs in general\r\nmonthly, and the second only once a year. At other places where I have\r\nsecured corresponding data the figures range from 19 to 40 days’ labor\r\nto scrape one acre, and average about the same as Lindley estimates.\r\n\r\nUnder some conditions sand-washing does not pay, and in still others\r\nit is almost impossible. No apparatus has yet been devised which will\r\nwash the dirt out of the fine dune-sands used in Holland without\r\nwashing a large part of the sand itself away, and in these works fresh\r\nsand, which is available in unlimited quantities and close to the\r\nworks, is always used. At Breslau the dirty sand is sold for building\r\npurposes for one third of the price paid for new sand dredged from the\r\nriver, delivered at the works, and no sand is ever washed. Budapest,\r\nWarsaw, and Rotterdam also use fresh river-sand without washing, except\r\na very crude washing to remove clay at Budapest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHEORY AND EFFICIENCY OF CONTINUOUS FILTRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first filters for a public water-supply were built by James\r\nSimpson, engineer of the Chelsea Water Company at London in 1829. They\r\nwere apparently intended to remove dirt from the water in imitation\r\nof natural processes, and without any very clear conception of either\r\nthe exact extent of purification or the way in which it was to be\r\naccomplished. The removal of turbidity was the most obvious result, and\r\na clear effluent was the single test of the efficiency of filtration,\r\nas it remains the legal criterion of the work of the London filters\r\neven to-day, notwithstanding the discovery and use of other and more\r\ndelicate tests.\r\n\r\nThe invention and use of methods for determining the organic matters\r\nin water by Wanklyn and Frankland, about 1870, led to the discovery\r\nthat the proportion of organic matters removed by filtration was\r\ndisappointingly low, and as, at the time, and for many years afterward,\r\nan exaggerated importance was given to the mere quantities of organic\r\nmatters in water, it was concluded that filtration had only a limited\r\ninfluence upon the healthfulness of the filtered water, and that\r\npractically as much care must be given to securing an unpolluted water\r\nas would be the case if it were delivered direct without filtration.\r\nThis theory, although not confirmed by more recent investigation,\r\nundoubtedly has had a good influence upon the English works by causing\r\nthe selection of raw waters free from excessive pollutions, and, in\r\ncases like the London supplies, drawn from the Thames and the Lea, in\r\nstimulating a most jealous care of the watersheds and the purification\r\nof sewage by the towns upon them.\r\n\r\nIt was only after the discovery of the bacteria in water and their\r\nrelations to health that the hygenic significance of filtration\r\ncommenced to be really understood. Investigations of the bacteria in\r\nthe waters before and after filtration were carried out at Berlin\r\nby Plagge and Proskauer, at London by Dr. Percy Frankland, and also\r\nat Zürich, Altona, and on a smaller scale at other places. These\r\ninvestigations showed that the bacteria were mainly removed by\r\nfiltration, the numbers in the effluents rarely exceeding two or three\r\nper cent of those in the raw water. This gave a new aspect to the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nIt was further observed, especially at Berlin and Zürich, that the\r\nnumbers of bacteria in effluents were apparently quite independent\r\nof the numbers in the raw water, and the theory was formed that all\r\nof the bacteria were stopped by the filters, and that those found in\r\nthe effluents were the result of contamination from the air and of\r\ngrowths in the underdrains. The logical conclusion from this theory was\r\nthat filtered water was quite suitable for drinking regardless of the\r\npollution of its source.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, found that the numbers of bacteria in the effluents\r\nwere higher immediately after scraping than at other times, and it was\r\nconcluded that before the formation of the sediment layer some bacteria\r\nwere able to pass the sand, and it was therefore recommended that the\r\nfirst water filtered after scraping should be rejected.\r\n\r\nPiefke at Berlin gave the subject careful study, and came to the\r\nconclusion that it was almost entirely the sediment layer which\r\nstopped the bacteria, and that the bacteria themselves in the sediment\r\nlayer formed a slimy mass which completely intercepted those in the\r\npassing water. When this layer was removed by scraping, the action\r\nwas stopped until a new crop of bacteria had accumulated. In support\r\nof this idea he stated that he had taken ordinary good filter-sand\r\nand killed the bacteria in it by heating it, and that on passing\r\nwater through, no purification was effected—in fact, the effluent\r\ncontained more bacteria than the raw water. After a little, bacteria\r\nestablished themselves in the sand, and then the usual purification\r\nwas obtained. Piefke concluded that the action of the filter was a\r\nbiological one; that simple straining was quite inadequate to produce\r\nthe results obtained; that the action of the filter was mainly confined\r\nto the sediment layer, and that the depth of sand beyond the slight\r\ndepth necessary for the support of this layer had no appreciable\r\ninfluence upon the results. The effect of this theory is still seen in\r\nthe shallow sand layers used at Berlin and some other German works,\r\nalthough at London the tendency is rather toward thicker sand layers.\r\n\r\nPiefke’s deductions, however, are not entirely supported by his data\r\nas we understand them in the light of more recent investigation.\r\nThe experiment with sterilized sand has been repeatedly tried at\r\nthe Lawrence Experiment Station with results which quite agree with\r\nPiefke’s, but it has also been found that the high numbers, often many\r\ntimes as high as in the raw water, do not represent bacteria which pass\r\nin the ordinary course of filtration, but instead enormous growths of\r\nbacteria throughout the sand supported by the cooked organic matter in\r\nit. It has been repeatedly found that ordinary sand quite incapable of\r\nsupporting bacterial growths, after heating to a temperature capable\r\nof killing the bacteria will afterwards furnish the food for most\r\nextraordinary numbers. A filter of such sand may stop the bacteria of\r\nthe passing water quite as effectually as any other filter, but if so,\r\nthe fact cannot be determined without recourse to special methods, on\r\naccount of the enormous numbers of bacteria in the sand, a small part\r\nof which are carried forward by the passing water, and completely mask\r\nthe normal action of the filter.\r\n\r\nThe theory that all or practically all of the bacteria are intercepted\r\nby the sediment layer, and that those in the effluent are the result\r\nof growths in the sand or underdrains, received two hard blows in 1889\r\nand 1891, when mild epidemics of typhoid fever followed unusually\r\nhigh numbers of bacteria in the effluents at Altona and at Stralau in\r\nBerlin, with good evidence in each case that the fever was directly due\r\nto the water. Both of these cases came during, and as the result of,\r\nsevere winter weather with open filters and under conditions which are\r\nnow recognized as extremely unfavorable for good filtration.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the first of these epidemics a series of experiments\r\nwere made at Stralau by Fränkel and Piefke in 1890. Small filters were\r\nconstructed, and water passed exactly as in the ordinary filters.\r\nBacteria of special kinds not existing in the raw water or effluents\r\nwere then applied, and the presence of a very small fraction of them\r\nin the effluents demonstrated beyond a doubt that they had passed\r\nthrough the filters under the ordinary conditions of filtration. These\r\nexperiments were afterwards repeated by Piefke alone under somewhat\r\ndifferent conditions with similar results. The numbers of bacteria\r\npassing, although large enough to establish the point that some do\r\npass, were nevertheless in general but a small fraction of one per cent\r\nof the many thousands applied.\r\n\r\nThis method of testing the efficiency of filters had already been\r\nused quite independently by Prof. Sedgwick at the Lawrence Experiment\r\nStation in connection with the purification of sewage, and has since\r\nbeen extensively used there for experiments with water-filtration.\r\n\r\nKümmel also found at Altona that while in the regular samples for\r\nbacterial examination, all taken at the same time in the day, there\r\nwas no apparent connection between the numbers of bacteria in the raw\r\nwater and effluents, by taking samples at frequent intervals throughout\r\nthe twenty-four hours, as has been done in a more recent series of\r\nexperiments, and allowing for the time required for the water to pass\r\nthe filters, a well-marked connection was found to exist between the\r\nnumbers of bacteria in the raw water and in the effluents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—SHOWING BACTERIA SUPPOSED TO COME THROUGH\r\nFILTERS AND FROM THE UNDERDRAINS.]\r\n\r\nThe subject has more recently been studied in much detail at the\r\nLawrence Experiment Station, and it now appears that the bacteria\r\nin the effluent from a filter are from two sources: directly from\r\nthe filtered water, and from the lower layers of the filter and\r\nunderdrains. Thus we may say:\r\n\r\n  Bacteria in effluent = Bacteria from underdrains + _a_/100 × bacteria\r\n  in raw water,\r\n\r\nwhere _a_ is the per cent of bacteria actually passing the filter.\r\n\r\nBoth of these terms depend upon a whole series of complex and but\r\nimperfectly understood conditions. In general the bacteria from the\r\nunderdrains are low in cold winter weather, often almost _nil_, while\r\nat Lawrence with water temperatures of 70 to 75 degrees, and over, in\r\nJuly and August, the numbers from this source may reach 200 or 300,\r\nbut for the other ten months of the year rarely exceed 50 under normal\r\nconditions. In summer especially it seems to be greater at low than\r\nat high rates of filtration (although a high rate for a short time\r\nonly increases it), and so varies in the opposite way from the numbers\r\nactually passing the filters. This subject is by no means clearly\r\nunderstood; it is difficult, almost impossible, to separate the numbers\r\nof bacteria into the two parts—those which come directly through and\r\nmay be dangerous, and those which have other origins and are harmless.\r\nThe sketch, Fig. 14, is drawn to represent my idea of the way they may\r\nbe divided. It has no statistical basis whatever. The light unshaded\r\nsection shows the percentage number of bacteria which I conceive to\r\nbe coming through a filter under given conditions at various rates of\r\nfiltration, while the shaded section above represents the bacteria from\r\nother sources, and the upper line represents the sum of the two, or\r\nthe total number of bacteria in the effluent. The relative importance\r\nof the two parts would probably vary widely with various conditions.\r\nWith the conditions indicated by the sketch the number of bacteria in\r\nthe effluent is almost constant: for a variation of only from 1.4 to\r\n2.5 per cent of the number applied for the whole range is not a wide\r\nfluctuation for bacterial results, but the number in the lower and\r\ndangerous section is always rapidly increasing with increasing rate.\r\n\r\nThis theory of filtration accounts for many otherwise perplexing facts.\r\nThe conclusion reached at Zürich and elsewhere that the efficiency of\r\nfiltration is independent of rate may be explained in this way. This is\r\nespecially probable at Zürich, where the number of bacteria in the raw\r\nwater was only about 200, and an extremely large proportion relatively\r\nwould have to pass to make a well-marked impression upon the total\r\nnumber in the effluent.\r\n\r\nThese underdrain bacteria are, so far as we know, entirely harmless;\r\nwe are only interested in them to determine how far they are capable\r\nof decreasing the apparent efficiency of filtration below the actual\r\nefficiency, or the per cent of bacteria really removed by the filter.\r\n\r\nThis efficiency is dependent upon a large number of conditions many\r\nof which have already been discussed in connection with grain-size\r\nof filter sand, underdrains, rate of filtration, loss of head, etc.,\r\nand a mere reference to them here will suffice. Perhaps the most\r\nimportant single condition is the rate, the numbers of bacteria passing\r\nincrease rapidly with it. Next, fine sand and in moderately deep\r\nlayers tends to give high efficiency. The influence of the loss of\r\nhead, often mentioned, is not shown to be important by the Lawrence\r\nresults, nor can I find satisfactory European results in support of\r\nit. Uniformity in the rate of filtration on all parts of the filtering\r\narea and a constant rate throughout the twenty-four hours are regarded\r\nas essential conditions for the best results. Severe winter weather\r\nhas indirectly, by disturbing the regular action of open filters, an\r\ninjurious influence, and has been the cause of most of the cases where\r\nfiltered waters have been known to injure the health of those who have\r\ndrunk them. This action is excluded in filters covered with masonry\r\narches and soil, and such construction is apparently necessary for the\r\nbest results in places subject to cold winters.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of filtration under various conditions has been studied\r\nby a most elaborate series of experiments at Lawrence with small\r\nfilters to which water has been applied containing a bacterium (_B.\r\nprodigiosus_) which does not occur naturally in this country and is\r\nnot capable of growing in the filter, so that the results should\r\nrepresent only the bacteria coming through the filter and not include\r\nany additions from the underdrains. These results, which have been\r\npublished in full in the reports of the Massachusetts State Board of\r\nHealth, especially for the years 1892 and 1893, show that the number\r\nof bacteria passing increases rapidly with increasing rate, and slowly\r\nwith decreasing sand thickness and increased size of sand-grain.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the number of bacteria passing is expressed by the formula\r\n\r\n                              1 [(rate)^2 × effective size of sand]\r\n  Per cent bacteria passing = — ————————————————————————————————————————\r\n                              2 ([sqrt](thickness of the sand in inches))\r\n\r\nwhere the rate is expressed in million gallons per acre daily, and\r\ncalculating by it the numbers of bacteria for the seventy-three months\r\nfor which satisfactory data are available from 11 filters in 1892 and\r\n1893, we find that\r\n\r\n In 14 cases the numbers observed were 4 to 9 times as great as the\r\n calculated numbers;\r\n\r\n In 6 cases they were 2 to 3 times as great;\r\n\r\n In 35 cases they were between 1/2 and 2 times the calculated numbers.\r\n\r\n In 17 cases they were 1/2 to 1/3 of them.\r\n\r\n In 11 cases they were less than 1/3 the calculated numbers.\r\n\r\nThe agreement is only moderately good, and in fact no such formula\r\ncould be expected to give more than very rough approximations, because\r\nit does not take into consideration the numerous other elements, such\r\nas uniformity and regularity of filtration, the influence of scraping,\r\nthe character of the sediment in the raw water, etc., which are known\r\nto affect the results. Perhaps the most marked general difference is\r\nthe tendency of new or freshly-filled filters to give higher, and\r\nof old and well-compacted filters to give lower, results than those\r\nindicated by the formula.\r\n\r\nComparing this formula with Piefke’s results given in his “Neue\r\nErmittelungen”[28] the formula gives in the first series (0.34 mm.\r\nsand, 0.50 m. thick, and rate 100 mm. per hour), 0.25 per cent passing,\r\nwhile the average number of _B. violacious_ reported, excluding the\r\nfirst day of decreased efficiency after scraping, was 0.26 per cent. In\r\nthe second series, with half as high a rate the numbers checked exactly\r\nthe calculated 0.06 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn other experiments,[29] however, in 1893, when the calculated per\r\ncent was also 0.25, only 0.03, 0.04, and 0.07 per cent were observed in\r\nthe effluents.\r\n\r\nComparing the results from the actual filters, (which numbers also\r\ninclude the bacteria from the underdrains and should therefore be\r\nsomewhat higher) with the numbers calculated as passing through,\r\nI find that for the 46 days, Aug. 20 to Oct. 4, 1893, for which\r\ndetailed results of the Stralau works are given by Piefke, the average\r\ncalculated number passing is 0.20 per\r\n\r\ncent, while twice as many were observed in the effluents; although\r\nthree of the filters gave better effluents than the other eight, and\r\nthe numbers from them approximated closely the calculated numbers. If\r\nwe calculate the percentages of bacteria passing a number of filters,\r\nusing the maximum rate of filtration allowed for the German filters\r\nwhere this is accurately determined, and for the English filters\r\ntaking the maximum rate at one and one-half times the rate obtained by\r\ndividing the daily quantity by the area of filters actually in use, we\r\nobtain:\r\n\r\n  ----------------------+--------+---------+-----------+--------------\r\n                        |Average |Effective| Maximum   | Per cent\r\n                        |Depth of| Size of | Rate of   | Bacteria\r\n                        |  Sand, |  Sand-  |Filtration.| passing\r\n                        | Inches.|  grain. |           |  1    r^2d\r\n                        |        |         |           |= - ----------\r\n                        |        |         |           |  2 [sqrt]sand\r\n  ----------------------+--------+---------+-----------+--------------\r\n  Hamburg               |  32    |   0.31  |   1.60    |  0.07\r\n  Altona                |  28    |   0.34  |   2.57    |  0.21\r\n  Berlin, Stralau       |  20    |   0.34  |   2.57    |  0.25\r\n  Berlin, Müggel        |  20    |   0.34  |   2.57    |  0.25\r\n  Berlin, Tegel         |  20    |   0.37  |   2.57    |  0.27\r\n  London, Southwark &   |        |         |           |\r\n    Vauxhall            |  36    |   0.34  |   2.81    |  0.22\r\n  London, West Middlesex|  39    |   0.37  |   2.81    |  0.23\r\n  London, Chelsea       |  54    |   0.36  |   3.27    |  0.26\r\n  London, Grand Junction|  30    |   0.40  |   3.27    |  0.39\r\n  London, Lambeth       |  36    |   0.36  |   3.75    |  0.42\r\n  Middlesborough        |  20    |   0.42  |   5.85    |  1.58\r\n  Zürich                |  26    |   0.35  |   7.50    |  1.90\r\n  ----------------------+--------+---------+-----------+--------------\r\n\r\nThe numbers actually observed are in every case higher than the\r\ncalculated per cents passing, as indeed they should be on account of\r\nthose coming from the underdrains, accidental contamination of the\r\nsamples, etc.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that filtration now practised in European works under\r\nordinary conditions never allows over 1 or 2 per cent bacteria of the\r\nraw water to pass, and ordinarily not over one fourth to one half\r\nof one per cent, although exact data cannot be obtained owing to\r\nmasking effect of the bacteria which come from below and which bear\r\nno relation to those of the raw water. By increasing the size of the\r\nfilters, fineness and depth of sand (as at Hamburg), the efficiency\r\ncan be materially increased above these figures. At the same time\r\nit must be borne in mind that the effectiveness of a filter may be\r\ngreatly impaired by inadequate underdraining, by fluctuating rates of\r\nfiltration where these are allowed, by freezing in winter in the case\r\nof open filters in cold climates, and by other irregularities, all of\r\nwhich can be prevented by careful attention to the respective points.\r\n\r\nThe action of a continuous filter throughout is mainly that of an\r\nexceedingly fine strainer, and like a strainer is mainly confined to\r\nthe suspended or insoluble matters in the raw water. The turbidity,\r\nsediment, and bacteria of the raw water are largely or entirely\r\nremoved, while hardness, organic matter, and color, so far as they are\r\nin solution, are removed to only a slight extent, if at all. Hardness\r\ncan be removed by the addition of lime in carefully determined quantity\r\nbefore filtration (Clark’s process), by means of which the excess of\r\ncarbonic acid in the water is absorbed and the lime added, together\r\nwith that previously in the water, is precipitated.\r\n\r\nOrdinary filtration will remove from one fourth to one third of the\r\nyellow-brown color of peaty water. A larger proportion can be removed\r\nby the addition of alum, which by decomposing forms an insoluble\r\ncompound of alumina with the coloring matter, while the acid of the\r\nalum goes into the effluent either as free acid, or in combination with\r\nthe lime or other base in the water, according to their respective\r\nquantities. Freshly precipitated alumina can be substituted for the\r\nalum at increased expense and trouble, and tends to remove the color\r\nwithout adding acid to the water. These will be discussed more in\r\ndetail in connection with mechanical filters. Alum is but rarely used\r\nin slow sand filtration, the most important works where it is used\r\nbeing in Holland with peaty waters.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the most conclusive test of the efficiency of filtration is\r\nthe healthfulness of the people who drink the filtered water; and the\r\nfact that many European cities take water-supplies from sources which\r\nwould not be considered fit for use in the United States and, after\r\nfiltering them, deliver them to populations having death-rates from\r\nwater-carried diseases which are so low as to be the objects of our\r\nadmiration, is the best proof of the efficiency of carefully conducted\r\nfiltration.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to refer to London, drawing its water from the\r\ntwo small and polluted rivers, the Thames and the Lea; to Altona,\r\ndrawing its water from the Elbe, polluted by the sewage of 6,000,000\r\npeople, 700,000 of them within ten miles above the intakes; to Berlin,\r\nusing the waters of the Havel and the Spree; to Breslau, taking its\r\nwater from the Oder charged with the sewage of mining districts in\r\nSilicia and Galicia, where cholera is so common; to Lawrence, with its\r\ngreatly decreased death-rate since it has had filtered water, and to\r\nthe hundred other places which protect themselves from the infectious\r\nmatters in their raw waters by means of filtration. A few of these\r\ncases are described more in detail in Appendices V to IX, and many\r\nothers in the literature mentioned in Appendix X.\r\n\r\nAn adequate presentation of even those data which have been already\r\nworked up and published would occupy too much space. I think every one\r\nwho has carefully studied the recent history of water filtration in\r\nits relation to disease has been convinced that filtration carefully\r\nexecuted under suitable and normal conditions, even if not an absolute,\r\nis at least a very substantial protection against water-carried\r\ndiseases, and the few apparent failures to remove objectionable\r\nqualities have been without exception due to abnormal conditions which\r\nare now understood and in future can be prevented.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTERIAL EXAMINATION OF WATERS.\r\n\r\nEvery large filter-plant should have arrangements for the systematic\r\nbacterial examination of the water before and after filtration,\r\nespecially where the raw water is subject to serious pollution. Such\r\nexaminations need not be excessively expensive, and they will not\r\nonly show the efficiency of the plant as a whole, but may be made to\r\nshow the relative efficiencies of the separate filters, the relative\r\nefficiencies at different parts of the periods of operation, the effect\r\nof cold weather, etc., and will then be a substantial aid to the\r\nsuperintendent in always securing good effluents at the minimum cost.\r\n\r\nIn addition a complete record of the bacteria in the water at different\r\ntimes may aid in determining definitely whether the water was connected\r\nwith outbreaks of disease. Thus if an outbreak of disease of any\r\nkind were preceded at a certain interval by a great increase in the\r\nnumber of bacteria,—as has been the case, for example, with the\r\ntyphoid epidemics at Altona and Berlin (see Appendices II and VII),—a\r\npresumption would arise that they might have been connected with\r\neach other, and each time it was repeated the presumption would be\r\nstrengthened, while, on the other hand, outbreaks occurring while the\r\nbacteria remained constantly low would tend to discredit such a theory.\r\n\r\nBacterial investigations inaugurated after an epidemic is recognized,\r\nas has frequently been done, seldom lead to results of value, both\r\nbecause the local normal bacterial conditions are generally unknown at\r\nthe commencement of the investigation, and because the most important\r\ntime, the time of infection, is already long past before the first\r\nsamples are taken. The fact that such sporadic activities have led\r\nto few definite results should throw no discredit upon continued\r\nobservations, which have repeatedly proved of inestimable value.\r\n\r\nConsiderable misconception of the use of bacterial examinations\r\nexists. The simple bacterial count ordinarily used, and of which I\r\nam now speaking, does not and cannot show whether a water contains\r\ndisease-germs or not. I object to the Chicago water, not so much\r\nbecause a glass of it contains a hundred thousand bacteria more\r\nor less, as because I am convinced, by a study of its source in\r\nconnection with the city’s death-rate, that it actually carries\r\ndisease-germs which prove injurious to thousands of those who drink\r\nit. Now the fact being admitted that the water is injurious to health,\r\nvariations in the numbers of bacteria in the water drawn from different\r\nintakes and at different times probably correspond roughly with varying\r\nproportions of fresh sewage, and indicate roughly the relative dangers\r\nfrom the use of the respective waters. If filters should be introduced,\r\nthe numbers of bacteria in the effluents under various conditions would\r\nbe an index of the respective efficiencies of filtration, and would\r\nserve to detect poor work, and would probably suggest the measures\r\nnecessary for better results.\r\n\r\nI would suggest the desirability of such investigations where\r\nmechanical filters are used, quite as much as in connection with\r\nslow filtration; and it would also be most desirable in the case of\r\nmany water-supplies which are not filtered at all. Such continued\r\nobservations have been made at Berlin since 1884; at London since 1886;\r\nat Boston and Lawrence since 1888; and recently at a large number\r\nof places, including Chicago, where observations by the city were\r\ncommenced in 1894. They are now required by the German Government in\r\nthe case of all filtered public water-supplies in Germany, without\r\nregard to the source of the raw water. The German standard requires\r\nthat the effluent from each single filter, as well as the mixed\r\neffluent and raw water, shall be examined daily, making at some works\r\n10 to 30 samples daily. This amount of work, however, can usually be\r\ndone by a single man; and when a laboratory is once started, the cost\r\nof examining 20 samples a day will not be much greater than if only\r\n20 a week are taken. In England and at some of the Continental works\r\ndrawing their waters from but slightly polluted sources, much smaller\r\nnumbers of samples are examined.\r\n\r\nThe question whether the examinations should be made under the\r\ndirection of the water-works company or department, or by an\r\nindependent body—as, for instance, by the Board of Health—will depend\r\nupon local conditions. The former arrangement gives the superintendent\r\nof the filters the best chance to study their action, as he can himself\r\ncontrol the collection of samples in connection with the operation\r\nof the filters, and arrange them to throw light upon the points he\r\nwishes to investigate; while examination by a separate authority\r\naffords perhaps greater protection against the possible carelessness or\r\ndishonesty of water-works officials. An arrangement being adopted in\r\nmany cases in Germany is to have a bacterial laboratory at the works\r\nwhich is under the control of the superintendent, and in which the very\r\nnumerous compulsory observations are made, while the Board of Health\r\ncauses to be examined from time to time by its own representatives,\r\nwho have no connection with the water-works, samples taken to check\r\nthe water-works figures, as well as to show the character of the water\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\nIt seems quite desirable to have a man whose principal business is to\r\nmake these examinations; as in case he also has numerous other duties,\r\nthe examinations may be found to have been neglected at some time when\r\nthey are most wanted. Such a man should have had thorough training in\r\nthe principles of bacterial manipulation, but it is quite unnecessary\r\nthat he should be an expert bacteriologist, especially if a competent\r\nbacteriologist is retained for consultation in cases of doubt or\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nINTERMITTENT FILTRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy intermittent nitration is understood that filtration in which the\r\nfiltering material is systematically and adequately ventilated, and\r\nwhere the water during the course of filtration is brought in contact\r\nwith air in the pores of the sand. In continuous filtration, which\r\nalone has been previously considered, the air is driven out of the sand\r\nas completely as possible before the commencement of filtration, and\r\nthe sand is kept continuously covered with water until the sand becomes\r\nclogged and a draining, with an incidental aeration, is necessary to\r\nallow the filter to be scraped and again put in service.\r\n\r\nIn intermittent filtration, on the other hand, water is taken over the\r\ntop of the drained sand and settles into it, coming in contact with\r\nthe air in the pores of the sand, and passes freely through to the\r\nbottom when the water-level is kept well down. After a limited time the\r\napplication of water is stopped, and the filter is allowed to again\r\ndrain and become thoroughly aerated preparatory to receiving another\r\ndose of water.\r\n\r\nThis system of treating water was suggested by the unequalled\r\npurification of sewage effected by a similar treatment. It has been\r\ninvestigated at the Lawrence Experiment Station, and applied to the\r\nconstruction of a filter for the city of Lawrence, both of which are\r\ndue to the indefatigable energy of Hiram F. Mills, C.E.\r\n\r\nIn its operation intermittent differs from continuous filtration in\r\nthat the straining action is less perfect, because the filters yield\r\nno water while being aerated, and must therefore filter at a greater\r\nvelocity when in use to yield the same quantity of water in a given\r\ntime, and also on account of the mechanical disturbance which is\r\nalmost invariably caused by the application of the water; but, on the\r\nother hand, the oxidizing powers of the filter, or the tendency to\r\nnitrify and destroy the organic matters, are stronger, and in addition,\r\nif the rate is not too high, the bacteria die more rapidly in the\r\nthoroughly aerated sand than is the case with ordinary filters.\r\n\r\nIt was found at Lawrence in connection with sewage filters that when\r\nnitrification was actively taking place the numbers of bacteria were\r\nmuch lower than under opposite conditions, and it was thought that\r\nnitrification in itself might cause the death of the bacteria. Later\r\nexperiments, however, with pure cultures of bacteria of various kinds\r\napplied to intermittent filters with water to which ammonia and salts\r\nsuitable for nitrification were added, showed that bacteria of all\r\nthe species tried were able to pass the filter in the presence of\r\nnitrification, producing at least one thousand times as much nitrates\r\nas could result in any case of water-filtration, as freely as was\r\nthe case when the ammonia was not added and there was but little\r\nnitrification. These results showed conclusively that nitrification\r\nin itself is not an important factor in bacterial removal, although\r\nnitrification and bacterial purification do to some extent go together;\r\nperhaps in part because the nitrification destroys the food of the\r\nbacteria and so starves them out, but probably much more because the\r\nconditions of aeration, temperature, etc., which favor nitrification\r\nalso favor equally, and even in its absence, the death of the bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe rate at which water must pass through an intermittent filter\r\nis, on account of the intervals of rest, considerably greater than\r\nthat required to give a corresponding total yield from a continuous\r\nfilter, and its straining effect is reduced to an extent comparable to\r\nthis increase in rate; and if other conditions did not come in, the\r\nbacterial efficiency of an intermittent filter would remain below that\r\nof a continuous one.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the bacterial efficiency has usually been found\r\nto be less with intermittent filters at the Lawrence Experiment\r\nStation, when they have been run at rates such as are commonly used for\r\ncontinuous filters in Europe, say from one and one half to two million\r\ngallons and upwards per acre daily. With lower rates, and especially\r\nwith rather fine materials, the bacterial efficiency is much greater;\r\nbut it may be doubted whether it would ever be greater than that of a\r\ncontinuous filter with the same filtering material and the same total\r\nyield per acre. The number of bacteria coming from the underdrains is\r\napparently generally less, and with very high summer temperatures much\r\nless, than in continuous filters, and this often gives an apparent\r\nbacterial superiority to the intermittent filters.\r\n\r\nThe effluents from intermittent often contain less slightly organic\r\nmatter than those from continuous filters; but, on the other hand,\r\nhardly any water proposed for a public water-supply has organic matter\r\nenough to be of any sanitary significance whatever, apart from the\r\nliving bodies which often accompany it; and if the latter are removed\r\nby straining or otherwise, we can safely disregard the organic matters.\r\nIn addition, the water filtered will in a great majority of cases have\r\nenough air dissolved in itself to produce whatever oxidation there is\r\ntime for in the few hours required for it to pass the filter, and it is\r\nonly at very low rates of filtration that intermittent filters produce\r\neffluents of greater chemical purity than by the ordinary process. The\r\nyellow-brown coloring matter present in so many waters appears to be\r\nquite incapable of rapid nitrification; and where it is to some extent\r\nremoved by filtration, the action is dependent upon other and but\r\nimperfectly understood causes which seem to act equally in continuous\r\nand intermittent filters.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of construction involved by this method of filtration\r\nwill be best illustrated by a discussion of the Lawrence city filter\r\ndesigned by Hiram F. Mills, C.E., which is the only filter in existence\r\nupon this plan.[30]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAWRENCE FILTER.\r\n\r\nThe filter consists of a single bed 2-1/2 acres in area, the bottom of\r\nwhich is 7 feet below low water in the river, and filled with gravel\r\nand sand to an average depth of 4-1/2 feet. The filter is all in a\r\nsingle bed instead of being divided into the three or four sections\r\nwhich would probably have been used for a continuous filter of this\r\nsize. The water-tight bottom also was dispensed with, and the gravel\r\nwas prevented from sinking into the silt by thin intermediate layers\r\nof graded materials. The saving in cost was considerable; but, on the\r\nother hand, a considerable quantity of ground-water comes up through\r\nthe bottom and increases the hardness of the water from 1.5 to 2.6\r\nparts of calcium carbonate in 100,000; and while the water when\r\ncompared with many other waters is still extremely soft, the addition\r\ncannot be regarded as desirable. The ground-water also contains iron,\r\nwhich increases the color of the water above what it would otherwise be.\r\n\r\nThe underdrains have a frictional resistance ten times as great as\r\nwould be desirable for a continuous filter, the idea being to check\r\nextreme rates of filtration in case of unequal flooding, and also to\r\nlimit the quantity of water which could be gotten through the filter to\r\nthat corresponding to a moderate rate of filtration.\r\n\r\nThe sand, instead of being all of the same-sized grain, is of two\r\ngrades, with effective sizes respectively 0.25 and 0.30 mm., the\r\ncoarser sand being placed farthest away from the underdrains, where\r\nits greater distance is intended to balance its reduced frictional\r\nresistance and make all parts filter at an equal rate.\r\n\r\nThe surface instead of being level is waved, that is, there are ridges\r\nthirty feet apart, sloping evenly to the valleys one foot deep half\r\nway between them, to allow water to be brought on rapidly without\r\ndisturbing the sand surface. For the same reason, as well as to secure\r\nequality of distribution, a system of concrete carriers for the raw\r\nwater goes to all parts of the filter, reducing the effective filtering\r\narea by 4 or 5 per cent. The filter is scraped as necessary in\r\nsections, the work being performed when the filter is having its daily\r\nrest and aeration. Owing to the difference in frictional resistance\r\nbefore and after scraping, and to the fact that it is impossible to\r\nscrape the entire area in one day, considerable variations in the rate\r\nof filtration in different parts of the filter must occur. The heavy\r\nfrictional resistance of the underdrains when more than the proper\r\nquantity of water passes them tends to correct this tendency especially\r\nfor the more remote parts of the filter, but perhaps at the expense of\r\nthose near to the main drain.\r\n\r\nThe filter is not covered as the suggestions in Chapter II would\r\nrequire, but this is hardly on account of its being an intermittent\r\nfilter.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the Massachusetts State Board of Health for 1893\r\nstates that during the first half of December, 1893, the surface\r\nremained covered, that is, it was used continuously, and after December\r\n16th it was so used when the temperature was below 24°, and was drained\r\nonly when the temperature was 24° or above. The days on which the\r\nfilter was drained during the remainder of December are not given, but\r\nduring January and February, 1894, the filter remained covered 29 days\r\nand was drained 30 days. Bacterial samples were taken on 44 of these\r\ndays, 22 days when it was drained and 22 when it was not. The average\r\nnumber of bacteria on the days when it was not drained was 137 and on\r\nthose days when it was drained 252 per cubic centimeter.\r\n\r\nFrom February 24th to March 12th the number of bacteria were unusually\r\nhigh, averaging 492 per cubic centimeter, or 5.28 per cent of the 9308\r\napplied. During this period the filter was used intermittently; there\r\nwas ice upon it, and parts of the surface were scraped under the ice,\r\nand high rates of filtration undoubtedly resulted on the scraped areas.\r\nAfter March 12th the ice had disappeared and very much better results\r\nwere obtained.\r\n\r\nWhile there may be some question as to the direct cause of this\r\ndecreased efficiency with continued cold weather and ice, the results\r\ncertainly are not such as to show the advisability of building open\r\nfilters in the Lawrence climate.\r\n\r\nThe cost of building the filter in comparison with European filters\r\nwas extraordinarily low—only $67,000, or $27,000 per acre of filter\r\nsurface. To have constructed open continuous filters of the same area\r\nwith water-tight bottoms, divided into sections with separate drains\r\nand regulating apparatus, with the necessary piping, would have cost at\r\nleast half as much more, and with the masonry cover which I regard as\r\nmost desirable in the Lawrence climate the cost would have been two or\r\nthree times the expenditure actually required.\r\n\r\nIt was no easy matter to secure the consent of the city government to\r\nthe expenditure of even the sum used; there was much skepticism as to\r\nthe process of filtration in general, and it was said that mechanical\r\nfilters could be put in for about the same cost. Insisting upon the\r\nmore complete and expensive form might have resulted either in an\r\nindefinite postponement of action, or in the adoption of an inferior\r\nand entirely inadequate process. Still I feel strongly that in the\r\nend the greater expense would have proved an excellent investment in\r\nsecuring softer water and in the greater facility and security of\r\noperating the filter in winter.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the effect of the Lawrence filter upon the health of\r\nthe city, I can best quote from Mr. Mills’ paper in the Report of\r\nthe Massachusetts State Board of Health for 1893, and also published\r\nin the Journal of the New England Water-works Association. Mr. Mills\r\nsays: “In the following diagram [Fig. 15] the average number of deaths\r\nfrom typhoid fever at Lawrence for each month from October to May, in\r\nthe preceding five years, are given by the heavy dotted line; and the\r\nnumber during the past eight months are given by the heavy full line.\r\n\r\n“The total number for eight months in past years has been forty-three,\r\nand in the present year seventeen, making a saving of twenty-six. Of\r\nthe seventeen who died nine were operatives in the mills, each of whom\r\nwas known to have drunk unfiltered canal water, which is used in the\r\nfactories at the sinks for washing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—TYPHOID FEVER IN LAWRENCE.]\r\n\r\n“The finer full line shows the number of those who died month after\r\nmonth who are not known to have used the poisoned canal water. The\r\nwhole number in the eight months is eight.\r\n\r\n“It is evident from the previous diagram [not reproduced] that the\r\nnumbers above the fine full line, here, follow after those at Lowell in\r\nthe usual time, and were undoubtedly caused by the sickness at Lowell;\r\nbut we have satisfactory reason to conclude that the disease was not\r\npropagated through the filter but that the germs were conveyed directly\r\ninto the canals and to those who drank of the unfiltered canal water.\r\nAmong the operatives of one of the large corporations not using the\r\ncanal water there was not a case of typhoid fever during this period.\r\nWarnings have been placed in the mills where canal water is used to\r\nprevent the operatives from drinking it.\r\n\r\n“We find, then, that the mortality from typhoid fever has, during the\r\nuse of the filter, been reduced to 40 per cent of the former mortality,\r\nand that the cases forming nearly one half of this 40 per cent were\r\nundoubtedly due to the continued use of unfiltered river water drawn\r\nfrom the canals.”\r\n\r\nThe records of typhoid fever in Lawrence before and after the\r\nintroduction of filters are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATHS FROM TYPHOID FEVER IN LAWRENCE, 1888-98.\r\n\r\n  --------+----------+-------------+------------------------------------\r\n          |          |             | Persons who are known to have been\r\n  Years.  |  Total   |  Deaths     |      exposed to infection.\r\n          |  Number  |    per      +--------------+---------------------\r\n          |   of     |  10,000     |              |  While living out\r\n          |  Deaths. |    of       | By drinking  | of town just before\r\n          |          | Population. | Canal Water. |   falling sick in\r\n          |          |             |              |      Lawrence.\r\n  --------+----------+-------------+--------------+---------------------\r\n  1888    |    48    |    11.36    |              |\r\n  1889    |    55    |    12.66    |              |\r\n  1890    |    60    |    13.44    |              |\r\n  1891    |    55    |    11.94    |              |\r\n  1892    |    50    |    10.52    |              |\r\n  1893    |    39    |     7.96    |              |\r\n  1894    |    24    |     4.75    |      12      |\r\n  1895    |    16    |     3.07    |       9      |       2\r\n  1896    |    10    |     1.86    |       2      |       4\r\n  1897    |     9    |     1.62    |              |\r\n  1898    |     8    |     1.39    |       1      |\r\n  --------+----------+-------------+--------------+---------------------\r\n    Filter put in operation September, 1893.\r\n  Average rate before the introduction of filtered water (1888-92) 11.31\r\n  Average rate afterward (1894-98)                                  2.54\r\n\r\nThese results show a striking reduction in the deaths from typhoid\r\nfever with the introduction of filtered water, which has been most\r\ngratifying in every way.\r\n\r\nThe more recent history of the underdrains of the Lawrence filter\r\nis particularly instructive. Owing to the absence of a water-tight\r\nbottom to the filter, and its low position, a certain amount of water\r\nconstantly entered the filter from the ground below. This water\r\ncontained iron in solution as ferrous carbonate. When this water came\r\nin contact with the filtered water in the gravel and underdrains, the\r\niron was oxidized by the dissolved oxygen carried in the filtered water\r\nand precipitated. This was accompanied by a growth of crenothrix in\r\nthe gravel and underdrains, which gradually reduced their carrying\r\ncapacity. This reduction in carrying capacity first became apparent\r\nin cold weather when the yield from the filter was less free than\r\nformerly. There was difficulty in maintaining the supply during the\r\nwinter of 1896-7 and more difficulty in the following winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—TYPHOID FEVER IN LAWRENCE, 1888 TO 1898.]\r\n\r\nThe sand of the filter was as capable of filtering the full supply\r\nof water as it ever had been, and the efficiency was as good; but\r\nthe underdrains were no longer able to collect the filtered water\r\nand deliver it. As the filtering area was ample for the supply, it\r\nwas desired to avoid construction of additional filtering area. The\r\nunderdrains were dug up and cleaned during the periods when the filter\r\nwas drained. As the filter is all in one bed, the times when the filter\r\ncould be allowed to remain drained, and when the work could proceed,\r\nwere limited. Great care was taken to leave the work in good condition,\r\nand free from passages, at the end of each day’s work, but the numbers\r\nof bacteria in the effluent nevertheless increased somewhat. Some\r\nweeks afterward the number of cases of typhoid fever in the city\r\nincreased. The numbers did not become as high as they had been prior to\r\nthe introduction of filtered water, but they were much higher than they\r\nhad been since that time, and they pointed strongly to the disturbance\r\nof the underdrains as the cause of the increase.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of bacteria in the applied water and in the effluent from\r\nthe Lawrence filter by months, from the time the filter was put in\r\noperation, compiled from the reports of the State Board of Health, as\r\nfar as available, are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTERIA IN WATER APPLIED TO AND EFFLUENT FROM LAWRENCE FILTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RAW WATER.\r\n\r\n  ----------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n                  |  1893. |  1894. |  1895. |  1896. |  1897. |  1898.\r\n  ----------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n  January         |        |  7,700 | 18,700 |  7,500 | 13,314 |  6,519\r\n  February        |        |  7,600 | 15,040 | 12,600 | 13,113 |  4,653\r\n  March           |        |  6,500 | 20,770 |  5,900 | 12,055 |  3,748\r\n  April           |        | 11,200 |  8,420 |  3,800 |  6,904 |  2,320\r\n                  |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n  May             |        |  6,000 |  7,000 |  9,600 |  4,625 |  2,050\r\n  June            |        |  8,300 |  9,000 |  6,400 |  4,650 |  6,775\r\n  July            |        |  2,400 | 10,000 |  3,900 |  6,240 |  2,840\r\n  August          |        |  3,100 |  5,000 |  2,700 | 10,700 |  8,575\r\n                  |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n  September       | 57,500 |  6,500 |  5,000 | 12,300 | 27,300 |  6,100\r\n  October         | 22,200 | 25,300 | 19,000 |  5,300 | 13,200 |  5,120\r\n  November        | 10,800 | 16,600 |  8,700 |  5,600 |  6,644 |  4,310\r\n  December        |  8,100 | 23,800 |  6,700 |  9,695 |  5,581 |  5,200\r\n                  +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n  Average         | 24,650 | 10,417 | 11,111 |  7,108 | 10,360 |  4,850\r\n\r\n                          EFFLUENT.\r\n\r\n  January         |        |    129 |    206 |    166 |     91 |     39\r\n  February        |        |    244 |    283 |    315 |     79 |     45\r\n  March           |        |    455 |    405 |    133 |     67 |     34\r\n  April           |        |    281 |     84 |     40 |     47 |     21\r\n                  |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n  May             |        |    134 |     68 |     56 |     35 |     48\r\n  June            |        |    110 |     68 |     22 |     56 |     50\r\n  July            |        |     25 |     50 |     39 |    106 |     22\r\n  August          |        |     36 |     38 |    146 |     72 |     28\r\n                  |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n  September       |  6,850 |     42 |     40 |     37 |     98 |     67\r\n  October         |  1,216 |    116 |     60 |     30 |     33 |     28\r\n  November        |    161 |    175 |     64 |     37 |     27 |    122\r\n  December        |    111 |    364 |     84 |     67 |     24 |\r\n                  +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n    Average       |  2,084 |    176 |    121 |     91 |     61 |     46\r\n                  |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n    Average       |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n      efficiency  |  91.55 |  98.31 |  98.91 |  98.72 |  99.41 |  98.95\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMNITZ WATER-WORKS.\r\n\r\nThe only other place which I have found where anything approaching\r\nintermittent filtration of water is systematically employed is\r\nChemnitz, Germany. The method there used bears the same relation to\r\nintermittent filtration as does broad irrigation of sewage to the\r\ncorresponding method of sewage treatment; that is, the principles\r\ninvolved are mainly the same, but a much larger filtering area is used,\r\nand the processes take place at a lower rate and under less close\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—PLAN OF AREA USED FOR INTERMITTENT FILTRATION\r\nAT CHEMNITZ.]\r\n\r\nThe water-works were built about twenty years ago by placing\r\nthirty-nine wells along the Zwönitz River, connected by siphon pipes,\r\nwith a pumping-station which forced the water to an elevated reservoir\r\nnear the city (Fig. 17). The wells are built of masonry, 5 or 6 feet in\r\ndiameter and 10 or 12 feet deep, and are on the rather low bank of the\r\nriver. The material, with the exception of the surface soil, and loam\r\nabout 3 feet deep, is a somewhat mixed gravel with an effective size of\r\nprobably from 0.25 to 0.50 mm., so that water is able to pass through\r\nit freely. The wells are, on an average, about 120 feet apart, and the\r\nline is seven eighths of a mile long.\r\n\r\nIt was found that in dry times the ground-water level in the entire\r\nneighborhood was lowered some feet below the level of the river without\r\neither furnishing water enough or stopping the flow of the river below.\r\nThe channel of the river was so silted that, notwithstanding the porous\r\nmaterial, the water could not penetrate it to go toward the wells.\r\n\r\nA dam was now built across the river near the pumping-station, and\r\na canal was dug from above the dam, crossing the line of wells and\r\nrunning parallel to it on the back side for about half a mile. Later a\r\nsimilar canal was dug back of the remaining upper wells. Owing to the\r\ndifference in level in the river above and below, the canals can be\r\nemptied and filled at pleasure. They are built with carefully prepared\r\nsand bottoms, and the sand sides are protected by an open paving, to\r\nallow the percolation of as much water as possible, and the sand is\r\ncleaned by scraping, as is usual with ordinary sand filters, once a\r\nyear or oftener.\r\n\r\nThe yield from the wells was much increased by these canals, but the\r\nwater of the river is polluted to an extent which would ordinarily\r\nquite prevent even the thought of its being used for water-supply, and\r\nit was found that the water going into the ground from the canals,\r\nand passing through the always saturated gravel to the wells, without\r\ncoming in contact with air at any point, after a time contained iron\r\nand had an objectionable odor.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this disagreeable result the meadow below the pumping-station\r\nwas laid out as an irrigation field (Fig. 16). The water from above the\r\ndam was taken by a canal on the opposite side of the river through a\r\nsedimentation pond (which, however, is not now believed to be necessary\r\nand is not always used), and then under the river by a siphon to a\r\nslightly elevated point on the meadow, from which it is distributed\r\nby a system of open ditches, exactly as in sewage irrigation. The\r\narea irrigated is not exactly defined and varies somewhat from time\r\nto time; the rate of filtration may be roughly estimated at from\r\n100,000 to 150,000 gallons per acre daily, although limited portions\r\nmay occasionally get five times these quantities for a single day. The\r\nwater passes through the three feet of soil and loam, and afterward\r\nthrough an average of six feet of drained coarse sand or gravel in\r\nwhich it meets air, and afterward filters laterally through the\r\nsaturated gravel to the wells. The water so obtained is invariably of\r\ngood quality in every way, colorless, free from odor and from bacteria.\r\nThe surface of the irrigated land is covered with grass and has\r\nfruit-trees (mostly apple) at intervals over its entire area.\r\n\r\nThis first system of irrigation is entirely by gravity. On account\r\nof natural limits to the land it could not be conveniently extended\r\nat this point, and to secure more area, the higher land above the\r\npumping-station was being made into an irrigation field in 1894. This\r\nis too high to be flooded by gravity, and will be used only for short\r\nperiods in extremely dry weather. The water is elevated the few feet\r\nnecessary by a gas-engine on the river-bank. In times of wet weather\r\nenough water is obtained from the wells without irrigation, and the\r\nland is only irrigated when the ground-water level is too low.\r\n\r\nDuring December, January, and February irrigation is usually impossible\r\non account of temperature, and the canals are then used, keeping them\r\nfilled with water so that freezing to the bottom is impossible; but\r\ntrouble with bad odors in the filtered water drawn from the wells is\r\nexperienced at these times.\r\n\r\nThe drainage area of the Zwönitz River is only about 44 square miles,\r\nand upon it are a large number of villages and factories, so that the\r\nwater is excessively polluted. The water in the wells, however, whether\r\ncoming from natural sources, or from irrigation, or from the canals,\r\nhas never had as many as 100 bacteria per cubic centimeter, and is\r\nregarded as entirely wholesome.\r\n\r\nIn extremely dry weather the river, even when it is all used for\r\nirrigation so that hardly any flows away below, cannot be made to\r\nsupply the necessary daily quantity of 2,650,000 gallons, and to supply\r\nthe deficiency at such times, as well as to avoid the use of the canals\r\nin winter, a storage reservoir holding 95,000,000 gallons has recently\r\nbeen built on a feeder of the river. This water, which is from an\r\nuninhabited drainage area, is filtered through ordinary continuous\r\nfilters and flows to the city by gravity. Owing to the small area of\r\nthe watershed it is incapable of supplying more than a fraction of the\r\nwater for the city, and will be used to supplement the older works.\r\n\r\nThis Chemnitz plant is of especial interest as showing the successful\r\nutilization of a river-water so grossly polluted as to be incapable of\r\ntreatment by the ordinary methods. Results obtained at the Lawrence\r\nExperiment Station have shown that sewage is incapable of being\r\npurified by continuous filtration, the action of air being essential\r\nfor a satisfactory result. With ordinary waters only moderately\r\npolluted this is not so; for they carry enough dissolved air to effect\r\ntheir own purification. In Chemnitz, however, as shown by the results\r\nwith the canals, the pollution is so great that continuous filtration\r\nis inadequate to purify the water, and the intermittent filtration\r\nadopted is the only method likely to yield satisfactory results in such\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nIntermittent filtration is now being adopted for purifying brooks\r\ndraining certain villages and discharging into the ponds or reservoirs\r\nfrom which Boston draws its water-supply. The water of Pegan Brook\r\nbelow Natick has been so filtered since 1893 with most satisfactory\r\nresults, and affords almost absolute protection to Boston from any\r\ninfection which might otherwise enter the water from that town. A\r\nsimilar treatment is soon to be given to a brook draining the city of\r\nMarlborough. The sewage from these places is not discharged into the\r\nbrooks, but is otherwise provided for, but nevertheless they receive\r\nmany polluting matters from the houses and streets upon their banks.\r\n\r\nThe filtration used resembles in a measure that at Chemnitz, and I am\r\ninformed by the engineer, Mr. Desmond FitzGerald, that it was adopted\r\non account of its convenience for this particular problem, and not\r\nbecause he attaches any special virtue to the intermittent feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLICATION OF INTERMITTENT FILTRATION.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the use of waters as grossly polluted as the Zwönitz,\r\nthe tendency is strongly to avoid their use, no matter how complete\r\nthe process of purification may be; but in case it should be deemed\r\nnecessary to use so impure a water for a public supply, intermittent\r\nfiltration is the only process known which would adequately purify\r\nit. And it should be used at comparatively low rates of filtration.\r\nI believe that an attempt to filter the Zwönitz at the rate used for\r\nthe Merrimac water at Lawrence, which is by comparison but slightly\r\npolluted, would result disastrously.\r\n\r\nThe operation in winter must also be considered. Intermittent\r\nfiltration of sewage on open fields in Massachusetts winters is only\r\npossible because of the comparatively high temperature of the sewage\r\n(usually 40° to 50°), and would be a dismal failure with sewage at\r\nthe freezing-point, the temperature to be expected in river-waters in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to draw a sharp line between those waters which are\r\nso badly polluted as to require intermittent filtration for their\r\ntreatment and those which are susceptible to the ordinary continuous\r\nfiltration. Examples of river-waters polluted probably beyond the\r\nlimits reached in any American waters used for drinking purposes and\r\nsuccessfully filtered with continuous filters are furnished by Altona,\r\nBreslau, and London.\r\n\r\nIntermittent filtration may be considered in those cases where it\r\nis proposed to use a water polluted entirely beyond the ordinary\r\nlimits, and for waters containing large quantities of decomposable\r\norganic matters and microscopical organisms; but in those cases where\r\na certain and expeditious removal of mud is desired, and where\r\nwaters are only moderately polluted by sewage, but still in their raw\r\nstate are unhealthy, it is not apparent that intermittent filtration\r\nhas any advantages commensurate with the disadvantages of increased\r\nrate to produce the same total yield and of the increased difficulty\r\nof operation, particularly in winter; and in such cases continuous\r\nfiltration is to be preferred.\r\n\r\nIn the removal of tastes and odors from pond or reservoir waters which\r\nare not muddy, but which are subject to the growths of low forms of\r\nplants, which either by their growth or decomposition impart to the\r\nwater disagreeable tastes and odors, intermittent filtration may have a\r\ndistinct advantage. In such cases there is often an excess of organic\r\nmatter to be disposed of by oxidation, and the additional aeration\r\nsecured by intermittent filtration is of substantial assistance in\r\ndisposing of these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTURBIDITY AND COLOR, AND THE EFFECT OF MUD UPON SAND-FILTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ideal water in appearance is distilled water, which is perfectly\r\nclear and limpid, and has a slight blue color. When other waters are\r\ncompared with it, the divergences in color from the color of distilled\r\nwater are measured, and not the absolute colors of the waters. Many\r\nspring waters and filtered waters are indistinguishable in appearance\r\nfrom distilled water.\r\n\r\nPublic water-supplies from surface sources contain two substances or\r\nclasses of substances which injure their appearance, namely, peaty\r\ncoloring matters, and mud. Waters discolored by peaty matters are most\r\ncommon in New England and in certain parts of the Northwest, while\r\nmuddy waters are found almost everywhere, but of different degrees of\r\nmuddiness, according to the physical conditions of the water-sheds from\r\nwhich they are obtained.\r\n\r\nMuddy waters are often spoken of as colored waters, and in a sense this\r\nis correct where the mud consists of clays or other materials having\r\ndistinct colors; but it is more convenient to classify impurities of\r\nthis kind as turbidities only, and to limit the term colored waters to\r\nthose waters containing in solution vegetable matters which color them.\r\n\r\nThe removal of either color or turbidity may be called clarification.\r\n\r\nColored waters are usually drawn from water-sheds where the underlying\r\nrock is hard and does not rapidly disintegrate, and where the soils are\r\nfirm and sandy, and especially from swamps. The water here comes in\r\ncontact with peat or muck, which colors it, but is so firm as not to\r\nbe washed by flood flows, and so does not cause turbidity.\r\n\r\nLarge parts of the United States have for rock foundations shales or\r\nother soft materials which readily disintegrate when exposed, and\r\nwhich form clayey soils readily washed by hard rains. Waters from\r\nsuch watersheds are generally turbid and very rarely colored. In fact\r\na water carrying much clay in suspension is usually found colorless\r\nwhen the clay is removed, even if it were originally colored. It thus\r\nhappens that waters which are colored and turbid at the same time\r\nhardly exist in nature.\r\n\r\nColor-producing matters and turbidity-producing matters are different\r\nin their natures, and the methods which must be used to remove them are\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEASUREMENT OF COLOR.\r\n\r\nThe colors of waters are measured and recorded by comparing them with\r\ncolors of solutions or substances which are permanent, or which can be\r\nreproduced at will. One of the earliest methods of measuring colors of\r\nwaters was to compare them with the colors of the Nessler standards\r\nused for the estimation of ammonia in water analysis. The Nessler\r\nstandards were similar in appearance to yellow waters, and their colors\r\ndepended upon the amounts of ammonia which had been used in preparing\r\nthem, and a record was made of the standard which most closely\r\nresembled the water under examination.\r\n\r\nThe method was open to the serious objections that the hues of the\r\nstandards did not match closely the hues of the waters; that the colors\r\nproduced with different lots of Nessler reagent differed considerably,\r\nand therefore the exact values of results were more or less uncertain;\r\nand further, that the numbers obtained for color were not even\r\napproximately proportional to the amounts of coloring matter present.\r\nBecause of this peculiarity, in filtration the percentage of color\r\nremoval, as determined by the use of these standards, is not even\r\napproximately correct, but is much above the truth.\r\n\r\nIn the Lovibond tintometer, which has been extensively used in England,\r\nthe standards of color are based upon the colors of certain glass\r\nslips, which are in turn compared with standard originals kept for\r\nthat purpose. This process answers quite well, but is open to some\r\nobjections because of possible uncertainties in the standardization of\r\nthe units.\r\n\r\nAnother method of measuring colors is to compare them with dilute\r\nsolutions of platinum and cobalt. The ratio of cobalt to platinum can\r\nbe varied to make the hue correspond very closely with the hues of\r\nnatural waters, and the amount of platinum required to match a water\r\naffords a measure of its color, one part of metallic platinum in 10,000\r\nparts of water forming the unit of color.\r\n\r\nThis standard has the advantages that it can be readily prepared with\r\nabsolute accuracy in any laboratory, and that by varying the ratio of\r\nplatinum to cobalt the hues of various waters can be most perfectly\r\nmatched. It is important that the observations should not be made in\r\ntoo great a depth, as the discrepancy in hues increases much more\r\nrapidly than the depth of color.\r\n\r\nFor further information regarding colors the reader is referred to\r\narticles in the American Chemical Journal, 1892, vol. xiv, page 300;\r\nJournal of the American Chemical Society, vol. ii, page 8; vol. xviii,\r\n1896, pp. 68, 264, and 484; Journal of the Franklin Institute, Dec.\r\n1894, p. 402; Journal of the New England Water Works Association, vol.\r\nxiii, 1898, p. 94.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMOUNT OF COLOR IN AMERICAN WATERS.\r\n\r\nNew England surface-waters have colors ranging from almost nothing\r\nup to 2.00. The colors of the public water-supplies of Massachusetts\r\ncities have been recorded in the reports of the State Board of Health\r\nfor some ten years. The figures given were recorded first upon the\r\nNessler standard, and afterwards upon a modification of the same, known\r\nas the natural water standard. The figures given are approximately\r\nequal to those for the platinum color standard, the relations between\r\nthe two having been frequently determined by various observers and\r\npublished in the above-mentioned papers. The accompanying diagram shows\r\nthe colors in several Massachusetts supplies, as plotted from the\r\nfigures given in the published reports.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—COLORS OF WATERS.\r\n\r\n(Analyses of the Mass. State Board of Health.)]\r\n\r\nIn Connecticut also the colors of many public water-supplies have been\r\nrecorded in the reports of the State Board of Health on the platinum\r\ncolor-standard.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the Middle States, with rare exceptions, are almost free\r\nfrom color. In the Northwest waters are obtained often with very high\r\ncolors, even considerably higher than the New England waters, and some\r\nof the Southern swamps also yield highly colored waters.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF COLOR.\r\n\r\nPeaty coloring-matter is almost perfectly in solution, and only a\r\nportion of it is capable of being removed by any form of simple\r\nfiltration. In order to remove the coloring-matter it is necessary to\r\nchange it chemically, or to bring it into contact with some substance\r\ncapable of absorbing it. For this reason sand filtration with ordinary\r\nsands, having no absorptive power for color, commonly removes only from\r\none fourth to one third of the color of the raw water.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENT OF TURBIDITY.\r\n\r\nThe amount of mud or turbidity in a water is often expressed as the\r\nweight of the suspended matters in a given weight of the water. Most\r\nof the data relating to turbidities of waters are stated in this\r\nway, because this was the only method recognized by the earlier\r\ninvestigators.\r\n\r\nThis method of statement has some disadvantages: it fails to take\r\ninto account the different sizes of particles which are carried in\r\nsuspension by different waters, and at different times. Thus the\r\nMerrimac River in a great flood may carry 100 parts in 100,000 of\r\nfine sand in suspension, and still it could hardly be called muddy;\r\nwhile another stream carrying only a fraction of this amount of fine\r\nclay would be extremely muddy. Further, an accurate determination of\r\nsuspended matters is a very troublesome and tedious operation, and\r\ncannot be undertaken as frequently as is necessary for an adequate\r\nstudy of the mud question.\r\n\r\nTurbidity is principally important as it affects the appearance of\r\nwater, and it would seem that optical rather than gravimetric methods\r\nshould be used for its determination. Various optical methods of\r\nmeasuring turbidity have been proposed. The general method employed\r\nis to measure the thickness of the layer of water through which some\r\nobject can be seen under definite conditions of lighting. The most\r\naccurate results can probably be obtained in closed receptacles and\r\nwith artificial light. Such a method has been used by Mr. G. W. Fuller\r\nat Louisville and Cincinnati in connection with his experiments, and is\r\ndescribed by Parmelee and Ellms in the Technology Quarterly for June,\r\n1899. This apparatus is called by Mr. Fuller a diaphanometer.\r\n\r\nAt the Lawrence Experiment Station of the Massachusetts State Board of\r\nHealth as early as 1889 it became necessary to express the turbidities\r\nof various waters approximately, and the very simple device of\r\nsticking a pin into a stick, and pushing it down into the water under\r\nexamination as far as it could be seen, was adopted. Afterwards a\r\nplatinum wire 0.04 of an inch in diameter was substituted for the pin,\r\nand the stick was graduated so that the turbidities could be read from\r\nit directly. The figures on the stick were inversely proportional to\r\ntheir distances from the wire. When the wire could be seen one inch\r\nbelow the surface, the turbidity was reported as 1.00; when the wire\r\ncould be seen two inches, the turbidity was 0.50, and when it could\r\nbe seen ten inches the turbidity was 0.10, etc. This scale is much\r\nmore convenient than a scale showing the depth at which the wire can\r\nbe seen; and within certain limits the figures obtained with it are\r\ndirectly proportional to the amount of the elements which obstruct\r\nlight in the water. Thus, if a water having a turbidity of 1.00 is\r\nmixed with an equal volume of clear water, the mixture will have a\r\nturbidity of 0.50. Advantage is taken of this fact for the measurement\r\nof turbidities so great that they cannot be accurately determined\r\nby direct observation. For turbidities much above 1.00 it is very\r\ndifficult to read the depth of wire with sufficient accuracy, and such\r\nwaters are diluted with one, two, or more times their volume of clear\r\nwater in a pail or other receptacle, the turbidity of the diluted water\r\nis taken, and multiplied by the appropriate factor.\r\n\r\nFor the greatest accuracy it is necessary that the observations should\r\nbe taken in the open air and not under a roof. They should preferably\r\nbe made in the middle of the day when the light is strongest, and in\r\ncase the sun is shining, the wire must be kept in shadow and not in\r\ndirect sunlight.\r\n\r\nThe turbidities of effluents are usually so slight that they cannot\r\nbe taken in this manner; in fact, turbidities of less than 0.02, with\r\nthe wire visible 50 inches below the surface, cannot be conveniently\r\nread in this way. For the estimation of lower turbidities a water is\r\ntaken having a turbidity of 0.03 or 0.04 and as free as possible from\r\nlarge suspended particles. The turbidity of this water is measured by\r\na platinum wire in the usual way, and the water is then diluted with\r\nclear water to make standards for the lower turbidities.\r\n\r\nThe comparisons between standards and waters are best made in bottles\r\nof perfectly clear glass, holding at least a gallon, and the comparison\r\nis facilitated by surrounding the bottles with black cloth except at\r\nthe point of observation, and lighting the water by electric lights so\r\narranged that the light passes through the water but is hidden from\r\nthe observer. In case the water under examination is colored, the\r\ncomparison is rendered difficult, and it is often advisable to add a\r\nsmall amount of methyl orange to the standards to make the colors equal.\r\n\r\nInstead of diluting a water of known turbidity for the standards, a\r\nstandard can be made by precipitating a known amount of silver chloride\r\nin the water. For this purpose about one per cent of common salt is\r\ndissolved in clear water and small measured amounts of silver nitrate\r\nadded, until the turbidity produced is equal to that of the water under\r\nexamination. The relation of the amount of silver nitrate used to the\r\nturbidity is entirely arbitrary, and is established by comparisons of\r\nstandards made in this way with waters having turbidities from 0.02 to\r\n0.04, the turbidities of which are measured with the platinum wire, and\r\nwhich afterwards serve to rate the standards. The silver chloride has a\r\nslight color, which is an objection to its use, and perhaps some other\r\nsubstance could be substituted for it with advantage. The standards\r\nhave to be made freshly each day.\r\n\r\nOne disadvantage of the platinum-wire method of observing turbidities\r\nin the open air, as compared with the diaphanometric method using\r\nartificial light, is that observations cannot be made in the night. To\r\nget the general character of the water in a stream, daily observations\r\ntaken about noon will generally be sufficient; but for some purposes it\r\nis important to know the turbidity at different hours of the day, and\r\nin such cases the platinum-wire method is at a distinct disadvantage.\r\nVariations in the amount of light, within reasonable limits, do not\r\naffect the results materially, although extreme variations are to be\r\navoided. The size of the wire also influences the results somewhat. The\r\nwire commonly used is 0.04 of an inch or one millimeter in diameter.\r\nA wire only four tenths of this size in some experiments at Pittsburg\r\ngave results 25 per cent higher; with a wire twice as large the\r\nresults were lower, but the differences were much less. Wire 0.04 of\r\nan inch in diameter was adopted as being very well adapted to rather\r\nturbid river-waters. For very clear lake or reservoir waters, usually\r\ntransparent to a great depth, a much larger object is preferable.\r\nWithin certain limits the results obtained with an object of any size\r\ncan be converted into corresponding figures for another object, or\r\nanother light, by the use of a constant factor. Thus the turbidities\r\nobtained with a platinum wire always have approximately the same ratio\r\nto the turbidities of the same waters determined by the diaphanometer.\r\n\r\nThe platinum-wire method has been used in many cases with most\r\nsatisfactory results. If it lacks something in theoretical accuracy\r\nas compared with more elaborate methods, it more than makes up for it\r\nby its simplicity; and reliable observations can be taken with it by\r\npeople who would be entirely incompetent to operate more elaborate\r\napparatus; and it can thus be used in many cases where other methods\r\nwould be impossible.\r\n\r\nUpon this scale the most turbid waters which have come under the\r\nobservation of the author have turbidities of about 2.50, although\r\nwaters much more turbid than this undoubtedly exist. A water with\r\na turbidity of 1.00 is extremely muddy, and only one tenth of this\r\nturbidity would cause remark and complaint among those who use it for\r\ndomestic purposes. In an ordinary pressed-glass tumbler a turbidity of\r\n0.02 is just visible to an ordinary observer who looks at the water\r\nclosely, but it is not conspicuous, nor would it be likely to cause\r\ngeneral complaint; and this amount may be taken as approximately the\r\nallowable limit of turbidity in a good public water-supply. In a\r\ncarefully polished, and perfectly transparent glass a turbidity of 0.01\r\nwill be visible, and in larger receptacles still lower turbidities may\r\nbe seen if the water is examined carefully. In gallon bottles of very\r\nclear glass, under electric light and surrounded by black cloth, a\r\nturbidity of 0.001 can be distinguished, but a turbidity even several\r\ntimes as large as this could hardly be detected except by the use of\r\nspecial appliances, or where water is seen in a depth of several feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATION OF PLATINUM-WIRE TURBIDITIES TO SUSPENDED MATTERS.\r\n\r\nThe relation of turbidity to the weight of suspended matters is\r\napproximately constant for waters from which the coarser matters have\r\nbeen entirely removed by sedimentation. For these waters the suspended\r\nmatters in parts per 100,000 are about 16 times the turbidity. For\r\nriver-waters the ratios are always larger. With very sluggish rivers\r\nthe ratio is only a little larger than for settled waters. For average\r\nriver-waters the ratio is considerably higher, and increases with the\r\nturbidity, and for very rapid rivers and torrents the ratio is much\r\nwider, as the suspended matters consist largely of particles which are\r\nheavy but do not increase very much the turbidity.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the amounts of suspended matters for various\r\nclasses of waters corresponding to the turbidities stated, which have\r\nbeen deduced from the experience of the author. It is very likely that\r\nratios different from the above would be obtained with waters in which\r\nthe sediment was of different character.\r\n\r\n  --------------+-----------------------------------------------\r\n                |     Suspended Matters: Parts in 100,000.\r\n   Turbidity,   +-----------------------------------------------\r\n  Platinum-wire |           |  River    |  River    |  River\r\n   Standard.    |  Settled  |  Waters,  |  Waters,  |  Waters,\r\n                |  Waters.  |  Finest   |  Average  | Coarsest\r\n                |           | Sediment. | Sediment. | Sediment.\r\n  --------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n      0.01      |    0.16   |           |           |\r\n      0.05      |    0.80   |    0.85   |    1.30   |    2.40\r\n      0.10      |    1.60   |    1.75   |    2.60   |    4.90\r\n      0.20      |    3.20   |    3.60   |    5.50   |   10.00\r\n      0.30      |    4.80   |    5.70   |    8.50   |   15.00\r\n      0.40      |    6.40   |    7.80   |   11.60   |   21.00\r\n      0.50      |    8.00   |   10.00   |   15.00   |   26.00\r\n      1.00      |   16.00   |   23.00   |   36.00   |   59.00\r\n      1.50      |   24.00   |   40.00   |   62.00   |   97.00\r\n      2.00      |   32.00   |   61.00   |   94.00   |  140.00\r\n      3.00      |   48.00   |  110.00   |  175.00   |  250.00\r\n  --------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCE OF TURBIDITY.\r\n\r\nMuch turbidity originates in plowed fields of clayey soil, or in\r\nfields upon which crops are growing. If it has not rained for some\r\ndays, and the surface-soil is comparatively dry, the first rain that\r\nfalls upon such land is absorbed by the pores of the soil until they\r\nare filled. If the rain is not heavy, but little runs off over the\r\nsurface. If, however, the rain continues rapidly after the surface-soil\r\nis saturated, the excess runs off over the surface to the nearest\r\nwatercourse. The impact of the rain-drops upon the soil loosens\r\nthe particles, and the water flowing off carries some of them in\r\nsuspension, and the water is said to be muddy.\r\n\r\nThe particles carried off in this way are extremely small. Mr. George\r\nW. Fuller, in his report upon water purification at Louisville,\r\nestimates that many of them are not more than a hundred thousandth of\r\nan inch in diameter, and not more than a tenth as large as common water\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\nThe turbidity of the water flowing from a field of loose soil may be\r\n2.00 or more; that is to say, the wire is hidden by a depth of half an\r\ninch of water or less. When the water reaches the nearest watercourse\r\nit meets with water from other kinds of land, such as woodlands and\r\ngrassed fields, and these waters are less turbid. The water in the\r\nfirst little watercourse is thus a mixture and has a turbidity of\r\nperhaps 1.00.\r\n\r\nThe conditions which control the turbidity of any brook are numerous\r\nand complicated. The turbidity of a stream receiving various brooks\r\ndepends upon the turbidities of all the waters coming into it.\r\nGenerally speaking, the turbidity of a river depends directly upon the\r\nturbidities of its feeders, and is not affected materially by erosion\r\nof its bed or by sedimentation in it. There are, of course, some\r\nstreams which in times of great floods cut their banks, and all streams\r\npick up and move about from place to place more or less of the sand and\r\nother coarse materials upon their bottoms. The materials thus moved,\r\nhowever, have but little influence upon the turbidity.\r\n\r\nAfter the rain is over some of the water held by the soil will find\r\nits way to the watercourses by underground channels, and will prevent\r\nthe stream from drying up between rains, but the average volume of the\r\nstream-flows between rains will be much less than the volumes during\r\nthe rains when the water is most turbid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—FLUCTUATIONS IN TURBIDITY OF THE WATER OF THE\r\nALLEGHENY RIVER AT PITTSBURG DURING 1898.]\r\n\r\nThese conditions are well illustrated by a few data upon the turbidity\r\nof three Pennsylvania streams, recently collected by the author. One\r\nof these streams is a small brook having a drainage area of less than\r\nthree square miles. The observations extended over a period of 47 days.\r\nDuring this time there were five floods, or an average of one flood in\r\nten days. The duration of floods was less than twenty-four hours in\r\neach case. Selecting the days when the turbidity was the highest, to\r\nthe number of one tenth of the whole number of days, the sum of the\r\nturbidities for these days was 67 per cent of the aggregate turbidities\r\nfor the whole period. That is to say, 67 per cent of the whole amount\r\nof mud was in the water of only a tenth of the days; the water of the\r\nother nine tenths of the days contained only 33 per cent of the whole\r\namount of turbidity. The average turbidity of the water for the flood\r\ndays was eighteen times as great as the average turbidity for the\r\nremaining days.\r\n\r\nThe next stream is a considerable creek having a drainage area of\r\n350 square miles. The observations extended over 117 days, during\r\nwhich time there were seven floods, or an average of one flood in 19\r\ndays. The floods lasted in each case one or two days, and the sum of\r\nthe turbidities for the one tenth of the whole number of days when\r\nthe water was muddiest was 55 per cent of the aggregate of all the\r\nturbidities for the period.\r\n\r\nThe last case is that of a large river, with a drainage area of over\r\n11,000 square miles. The observations extended over a full year. In\r\nthis period there were sixteen floods, each lasting from one to six\r\ndays, and the sum of the turbidities for the one tenth of the whole\r\nnumber of days when the water was muddiest is 45 per cent of the\r\naggregate turbidities for the year. The floods occurred on an average\r\nof once in 22 days, and the average duration was two and one half days.\r\n\r\nThe results are very striking as showing that a very large proportion\r\nof the mud is carried by the water in flood flows of comparatively\r\nshort duration. They also show that in small streams the proportion of\r\nmud in the flood-flows is greater, and the average duration of floods\r\nis shorter, than in larger streams. In other words, the differences\r\nbetween flood- and low-water flows are greatest in small streams, and\r\ngradually become less as the size of the stream increases.\r\n\r\nWhen a stream is used for water-works purposes in the usual way, a\r\ncertain quantity of water is taken from the stream each day, which\r\nquantity is nearly constant, and is not dependent upon the condition\r\nof the stream, or the volume of its flow. The proportions of the\r\ntotal flows taken at high- and low-water stages are very different,\r\nand it thus happens that the average quality of the water taken for\r\nwater-works purposes is different from the average quality of all the\r\nwater flowing in the stream.\r\n\r\nLet us assume, for example, a stream having a watershed of such a\r\nsize that in times of moderate floods water from the most distant\r\npoints reaches the water-works intake in twenty-four hours. Let us\r\nassume further that rainfalls of sufficient intensity to cause floods\r\nand muddy water occur, on an average, once in ten days, and that the\r\nturbidity of the water at these times reaches 1.00, and that for the\r\nrest of the time the turbidity averages 0.10. Let us assume further\r\nthat at times of storms the average flow of the stream is 100 units\r\nof volume, and for the nine days between storms the average flow is\r\n10 units of volume. We shall then have in a ten days’ period, for one\r\nday, 100 volumes of water with a turbidity of 1.00, and nine days with\r\n10 volumes each, or a total of 90 volumes of water with a turbidity\r\nof 0.10. The total discharge of the stream will then be 190 volumes,\r\nand the average turbidity 0.57. The turbidity of 0.57 represents the\r\naverage turbidity all the water flowing in the stream, or, in other\r\nwords, the turbidity which would be found in a lake if all the water\r\nfor ten days should flow into it and become thoroughly mixed without\r\nother change.\r\n\r\nNow let us compute the average turbidity of the water taken from the\r\nstream for water-works purposes. The water-works require, let us\r\nsay, one volume each day, and we have for the first day water with a\r\nturbidity of 1.00, and then for nine days water with a turbidity of\r\n0.10. The average turbidity of the water taken by the water-works for\r\nthe period is thus only 0.19 in place of 0.57, the average turbidity of\r\nthe whole run-off.\r\n\r\nThe average turbidity of all the water flowing in the stream is thus\r\nthree times as great as that of the water taken from the stream for\r\nwater-works purposes.\r\n\r\nIt is often noted that with long streams the water becomes muddier\r\nfarther down, and it may naturally be thought that it is because of the\r\nadded erosion of the stream upon its bed in its longer course. This, of\r\ncourse, may be a cause, or the lower tributaries may be muddier than\r\nthe upper ones, but the fact that the water taken at the lower point is\r\nmore muddy than farther up is not an indication of this.\r\n\r\nLet us take, for example, a watershed of twice the size of that assumed\r\nabove, that is, so long that 48 hours will be required for the water\r\nfrom the most remote feeders to reach the water-works intake. Let us\r\ndivide this shed into two parts, which we will assume to be equal, one\r\nof which furnishes water reaching the intake within 24 hours, and the\r\nother water reaching the intake between 24 and 48 hours. Now suppose\r\na storm upon the watershed producing turbidities equal to those just\r\nassumed for the smaller stream. On the first day the water from the\r\nlower half of the shed, namely, 100 volumes having a turbidity of 1.00,\r\npasses the intake, but this is mixed with 10 volumes of water from\r\nthe upper half of the watershed, having a turbidity of 0.10, and the\r\ntotal flow is thus 110 volumes of water having a turbidity of 0.92.\r\nOn the second day the water from the lower half of the watershed has\r\nreturned to its normal condition, and the flood-flow of the upper half\r\nof the watershed, 100 volumes with a turbidity of 1.00, is passing,\r\nand mingles with the 10 volumes from the lower half with a turbidity\r\nof 0.10, and the total flow is again 110 volumes having a turbidity of\r\n0.92. The following eight days, until the next rain, will have flows\r\nof 20 volumes each, with turbidities of 0.10. The average turbidity of\r\nall of the water flowing off is 0.57 as before, but the water taken\r\nfor water-works purposes will consist of 2 volumes of water with\r\nturbidities of 0.92, and 8 volumes with turbidities of 0.10 making 10\r\nvolumes with an average turbidity of 0.26.\r\n\r\nBy doubling the length of the watershed we have thus doubled the length\r\nof time during which the water is turbid, and have increased the\r\naverage turbidity of the water taken for water-works purposes from 0.19\r\nto 0.26, although the average turbidity of all the water running off\r\nremains exactly the same.\r\n\r\nIf now we assume a watershed so long that three days are required\r\nfor the water from the most remote points to reach the intake, with\r\ncomputations as above, water taken for water-works purposes will have\r\nan average turbidity of 0.32; and with still longer watersheds this\r\namount will increase, until with a watershed so long that ten days,\r\nor the interval between rains, are required for the water from the\r\nupper portions to reach the intake, the average turbidity of the water\r\ntaken for water-works purposes will reach the average turbidity of the\r\nrun-off, namely, 0.57.\r\n\r\nIn the above computations the numbers taken are round ones, and of\r\ncourse do not represent closely actual conditions. They do serve,\r\nhowever, to illustrate clearly the principle that the larger the\r\nwatershed, other things being equal, the more muddy will be the water\r\nobtained from it for water-works purposes, and the longer will be the\r\nperiods of muddy water, and the shorter the periods of clear water\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too strongly emphasized that the period of duration of\r\nmuddy water is, in general, dependent upon the length of time necessary\r\nfor the muddy water to run out of the stream system after it is once in\r\nit, and be replaced by clear water; and that the settling out of the\r\nmud in the river has very little to do with it.\r\n\r\nMuddy waters result principally from the action of rains upon the\r\nsurface of ground capable of being washed, and the turbidities of the\r\nstream at any point below will occur at the times when the muddy waters\r\nreach it in the natural course of flow, and will disappear again when\r\nthe muddy waters present in the stream system at the end of the rain\r\nhave run out, and have been replaced with clear water from underground\r\nsources, or from clearer surface sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMOUNTS OF SUSPENDED MATTERS IN WATER.\r\n\r\nThere is a large class of waters, including most lake and reservoir\r\nwaters, and surface-waters from certain geological formations, which\r\nare almost free from suspended matters and turbidities. That is to say,\r\nthe average turbidities are less than 0.10, and the average suspended\r\nmatters are less than 2 parts in 100,000, and are often only small\r\nfractions of these figures. This class includes the raw waters of the\r\nsupplies of many English cities drawn from impounding reservoirs, and\r\nalso the waters of the rivers Thames and Lea at London, and the raw\r\nwaters used by both of the Berlin water-works, and in the United States\r\nthe waters of the great lakes except at special points near the mouths\r\nof rivers, nearly all New England waters, and many other waters along\r\nthe Atlantic coast and elsewhere where the geological formations are\r\nfavorable.\r\n\r\nData regarding the suspended matters in these waters are extremely\r\nmeagre. The official examinations of the London waters contain no\r\nrecords of suspended matters, although the clearness of filtered\r\nwaters is daily reported. Dibden, in his analytical investigations of\r\nthe London water-supply, mentioned in his book upon “The Purification\r\nof Sewage and Water,” reports the average suspended matters in the\r\nwater of the Thames near the water-works intakes as 0.77 part in\r\n100,000. No figures are available for the raw waters used by the Berlin\r\nwater-works, but both are taken from lakes, and are generally quite\r\nclear. Even in times of floods of the rivers feeding the lakes, the\r\nturbidities are not very high, because the gathering grounds for the\r\nwaters are almost entirely of a sandy nature, yielding waters with low\r\nturbidities, and further, the streams flow through successions of lakes\r\nbefore finally reaching the lakes from which the waters are taken. It\r\nis safe to assume that the suspended matters and turbidities do not\r\nexceed those of the London waters. Even at times when somewhat turbid\r\nwater is obtained, due to agitation by heavy winds, the suspended\r\nmatter is mainly of a sandy nature, readily removed by settling, and\r\nit does not seriously interfere with filtration.\r\n\r\nThe examinations of the Massachusetts State Board of Health, with a\r\nvery few exceptions, contain no statements of suspended matters. This\r\nis due to the fact that the suspended matters, in most of the waters,\r\nare so small in amount as to make them hardly capable of determination\r\nby the ordinary gravimetric processes, and the determinations if made\r\nwould have but little value. The Merrimac River at Lawrence, at the\r\ntime of the greatest flood in fifty years, carried silt to the amount\r\nof about 111 parts in 100,000. This was for a very short time, and the\r\nsuspended matter consisted almost entirely of sand, which deposited\r\nin banks, the deposited sand having an effective size of 0.04 or 0.05\r\nmillimeter. No clayey matter is ever carried in quantity by the river.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Connecticut State Board of Health also contain no\r\nrecords of suspended matters for the same reason. It may be safely said\r\nthat the average suspended matters of New England waters are almost\r\nalways less than 1 part in 100,000.\r\n\r\nLake waters are generally almost entirely free from sediment. At\r\nChicago the city water drawn from Lake Michigan has slightly more than\r\n1 part in 100,000 of suspended matters, as determined by Professor Long\r\nin 1888-9, and by Professor Palmer in 1896. The suspended matter in\r\nthis case is probably due to the nearness of the intake to the mouth of\r\nthe Chicago River, and to mud brought up from the bottom in times of\r\nstorms. The lake-water further away from the shore would probably give\r\nmuch lower results.\r\n\r\nTurning now to waters having considerable turbidities, at Pittsburg the\r\naverage suspended matters in the Allegheny River water, as shown by\r\nthe weekly or semi-weekly analyses of the Filtration Commission during\r\n1897-8, were 4 parts in 100,000. During a large part of the time the\r\nsuspended matters were so small that it was not deemed worth while\r\nto determine them, and the results are returned as zero. This is not\r\nquite correct, and a recomputation of the amount of suspended matters,\r\nbased on the observed amounts, and the amounts calculated from the\r\nturbidities when they were very low, leads to an average of a little\r\nless than 5 parts in 100,000, which is probably more accurate than the\r\ndirect average. The average turbidity on the platinum-wire scale was\r\n0.16.\r\n\r\nAt Cincinnati the suspended matters are about 23 parts in 100,000,\r\nand at Louisville about 35 parts, both of these figures being from\r\nMr. Fuller’s reports. In all these cases the enormous and rapid\r\nfluctuations in the turbidity of the water is a most striking feature\r\nof the results.\r\n\r\nObservations on the Mississippi River above the Ohio have been\r\nmade by Professor Long in 1888-9, and by Professor Palmer in 1896.\r\nThese results are not as full and systematic as could be desired,\r\nbut indicate averages of 20 to 30 parts in 100,000 at the different\r\npoints. Professor William Ripley Nichols, in his work on water-supply,\r\nstates the amount of suspended matter in the water of the Mississippi,\r\nprobably referring to the lower river, as 66.66 parts.\r\n\r\nInvestigations of Professor Long and Professor Palmer for numerous\r\ninterior Illinois streams extending over considerable periods give\r\naverage results ranging from 1 to 8 parts in 100,000. The very much\r\nlower results for the interior streams as compared with the Mississippi\r\nand Ohio rivers may be due to the relative sizes and lengths of the\r\nstreams, or in part to other causes.\r\n\r\nRegarding muddy European rivers there are but few data. The Maas, used\r\nfor the water-supply of Rotterdam, is reported by Professor Nichols as\r\nhaving from 1.40 to 47.61 and averaging 10 parts of suspended matters\r\nin 100,000. More recent information is to the effect that the raw water\r\nhas at most 30 parts of suspended matters, and that that quantity is\r\nvery seldom reached.\r\n\r\nAt Bremen the Weser often becomes quite turbid. The turbidity of the\r\nwater is noted every day by taking the depth at which a black line on a\r\nwhite surface can be seen. Assuming that this procedure is equivalent\r\nto the platinum-wire procedure, the depths at which the wire can be\r\nseen, namely, from 15 to 600 millimeters, correspond to turbidities of\r\nfrom 0.04 to 1.70, a result not very different from the conditions at\r\nPittsburg.\r\n\r\nAt Hamburg and Altona the water is generally tolerably clear, but at\r\ntimes of flood the Elbe becomes very turbid, and the amount of mud\r\ndeposited in the sedimentation-basins is considerable. At Dresden,\r\nseveral hundred miles up the river, I have repeatedly seen the\r\nriver-water extremely turbid with clayey matter, the color of the clay\r\nvarying from day to day, corresponding to the color of the earth from\r\nwhich it had been washed.\r\n\r\nAt Budapest, where filters were used temporarily, the Danube water\r\nwas excessively muddy with clayey material. At first very high rates\r\nof filtration were employed and the results were not satisfactory.\r\nAfterward the rate of filtration was limited to 1.07 million gallons\r\nper acre daily, and good results were secured. There was no preliminary\r\nsedimentation. Professor Nichols reports the average suspended matters\r\nin the Danube at 32.68 parts in 100,000, but does not state at what\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nMany of the French and German rivers drain prairie country not\r\ndifferent in its general aspect from the Mississippi basin, and the\r\nsoil is probably in many places similar. There is no reason to suppose\r\nthat the turbidities of these streams in general are materially\r\ndifferent from those of corresponding streams in the United States,\r\nalthough it is true that, other things being equal, the average\r\nturbidity of water taken for water-works purposes will increase with\r\nthe size of the stream; and it may be that some American streams,\r\nespecially the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi rivers, are of larger\r\nsize than European streams, and consequently that the turbidity of the\r\nwater taken from them for water-works purposes may be greater.\r\n\r\nThe following are the drainage areas of a number of European and\r\nAmerican streams yielding more or less muddy waters at points where\r\nthey are used for public water-supplies after filtration, with a few\r\nother American points for comparison. The results are obtained in most\r\ncases from measurements of the best available maps.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+------------------------+----------------\r\n                       |                        | Drainage Area,\r\n         Place.        |        River.          | Square Miles.\r\n  ---------------------+------------------------+----------------\r\n  New Orleans, La.     | Mississippi            |  1,261,000\r\n  St. Louis, Mo.       | Mississippi            |    700,000\r\n  St. Petersburg       | Neva                   |    108,000\r\n  Louisville, Ky.      | Ohio                   |     90,000\r\n  Rock Island, Ill.    | Mississippi            |     88,000\r\n  Budapest             | Danube                 |     79,000\r\n  Cincinnati, O.       | Ohio                   |     75,700\r\n  Dordrecht            | Maas                   |     68,000\r\n  Rotterdam            | Maas                   |     68,000\r\n  Schiedam             | Maas                   |     68,000\r\n  Altona               | Elbe                   |     52,000\r\n  Hamburg              | Elbe                   |     52,000\r\n  Stettin              | Oder                   |     40,000\r\n  Magdeburg            | Elbe                   |     36,000\r\n  Warsaw               | Weichsel               |     34,000\r\n  Odessa               | Dneister               |     26,000\r\n  Worms                | Rhine                  |     25,000\r\n  Grand Forks, N.

One of the most important\r\nof these processes is the use of reservoirs.\r\n\r\nReservoirs serve two purposes in connection with waters drawn\r\nfrom streams: they allow sedimentation, and they afford storage.\r\nIf a water having a turbidity of 1.00 is allowed to remain in a\r\nsedimentation-basin for 24 hours, its turbidity may be reduced by\r\nas much as 40 per cent, or to 0.60. If it is held a second day the\r\nadditional reduction is much less.\r\n\r\nIf samples are taken of the water in the reservoir before and after\r\nsettling and sent to the chemist for analysis, he will probably report\r\nthat from 70 to 80 per cent of the suspended matters have been removed\r\nby the process. The suspended matters are removed in much larger ratio\r\nthan the turbidity. This arises from the fact that there is a certain\r\nproportion of comparatively coarse material in the water as it is\r\ntaken from the river. This coarse material increases the weight of the\r\nsuspended matters without increasing the turbidity in a corresponding\r\ndegree. In 24 hours the coarser materials are removed completely, and\r\nat the end of that time only the clayey or finer particles remain in\r\nsuspension. It is these clayey particles, however, that constitute the\r\nturbidity, which are most objectionable in appearance, and which are\r\nmost difficult of removal by filtration or otherwise.\r\n\r\nSedimentation thus removes the heavier matters from the water,\r\nbut it does not remove the finer matters which principally affect\r\nthe appearance of the water and are otherwise most troublesome. A\r\nsedimentation of 24 hours removes practically all of the coarser\r\nmatters, and the clayey material remaining at the end of that time\r\ncan hardly be removed by further sedimentation. The economic limit of\r\nsedimentation is about 24 hours.\r\n\r\nSedimentation has practically no effect upon the clearer waters between\r\nflood periods.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the effect of a sedimentation-basin, or reservoir\r\nholding a 24-hours’ supply of water, into which water is constantly\r\npumped at one end, and from which an equal quantity is constantly\r\nwithdrawn from the other, upon the water of a stream of such size\r\nthat the time of passage of water from the feeders to the intake is\r\nless than 24 hours. During the period between storms the water is\r\ncomparatively clear and passes through the sedimentation basin without\r\nchange. When a storm comes the water in the stream promptly becomes\r\nmuddy, and muddy water is supplied to the reservoir; but owing to\r\nthe time required for water to pass through it, the outflowing water\r\nremains clear for some hours. There is a gradual mixing, however, and\r\nlong before the expiration of 24 hours somewhat muddy water appears\r\nat the outlet. The turbid-water period rarely lasts in streams of\r\nthis size more than 24 hours, and at the expiration of that time the\r\nwater in the sedimentation-basin is as muddy or muddier than the water\r\nflowing in the stream. After the height of the flood the stream clears\r\nitself by the flowing away of the turbid water much more rapidly than\r\nthe water clears itself by sedimentation in the reservoir. That is to\r\nsay, if at the time of maximum turbidity we take a certain quantity of\r\nwater from the stream and put it aside to settle, at no time will the\r\nimprovement by settling equal the improvement which has taken place in\r\nthe stream from natural causes. Generally the improvement in the stream\r\nis several times as rapid as in the sedimentation-basin, and the water\r\nfrom it will at times have only a fraction of the turbidity of the\r\nwater in the basin.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider what the sedimentation has done to improve the\r\nwater. During the period of clear water, that is for most of the\r\ntime, it has done nothing. For the first day of each flood period\r\nvery much clearer water has been obtained from it than was flowing\r\nin the stream. For the first days following floods the water in the\r\nsedimentation-basin has been more muddy than the water in the stream.\r\nThe only time when the sedimentation-basin has been of use is during\r\nthe first part of floods, that is, when the turbidity of the water in\r\nthe stream is increasing. During this period it has been of service\r\nprincipally because of its storage capacity, yielding up water received\r\nfrom the stream previously, when it was less muddy. Such sedimentation\r\nas has been secured is merely incidental and generally not important in\r\namount.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious from the above that for these conditions storage\r\nis much more important than sedimentation. This brings us back to\r\nthe old English idea of having storage-reservoirs large enough to\r\ncarry water-works over flood periods without the use of flood-waters.\r\nReservoirs of this kind were, and still are, considered necessary for\r\nthe successful utilization of waters of many English rivers, although\r\nthese waters do not approach in turbidity the waters of some American\r\nstreams. This idea of storage has been but little used in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn the above case, if we use our reservoir for storage instead of as a\r\nsedimentation-basin, the average quality of the water can be greatly\r\nimproved. The reservoir should ordinarily be kept full, and pumping to\r\nit should be stopped whenever the turbidity exceeds a certain limit,\r\nto be determined by experience; and the reservoir is then to be drawn\r\nupon for the supply until the turbidity again falls to the normal. In\r\nthe case assumed above, with a stream in which all of the water reaches\r\nthe intake in 24 hours, a reservoir holding a 24-hours’ supply, or in\r\npractice, to be safe, a somewhat larger one, would yield a water having\r\na very much lower average turbidity than would be obtained with water\r\npumped constantly from the stream without a reservoir.\r\n\r\nWith a river having a watershed so long that 48 hours are required to\r\nbring the water down from the most remote feeders, a reservoir twice as\r\nlarge would be required, and would result in a still greater reduction\r\nin the average turbidity.\r\n\r\nAs the stream becomes larger, and the turbid periods longer, the size\r\nof a reservoir necessary to utilize this action rapidly becomes larger,\r\nand the times during which it can be filled are shortened, and thus the\r\nengineering difficulties of the problem are increased. For moderately\r\nshort streams, cost for cost, storage is far more effective than\r\nsedimentation, and we must come back to the old English practice of\r\nstopping our pumps during periods of maximum turbidity.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF MUD UPON SAND FILTERS.\r\n\r\nThere are two aspects of the effect of mud upon the operation of sand\r\nfilters which require particular consideration. The first relates to\r\nthe rapidity of clogging, and consequently the frequency of scraping\r\nand the cost of operation; while the second relates to the ability of\r\nthe filters to yield well-clarified effluents.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF TURBIDITY UPON THE LENGTH OF PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe amount of water which can be filtered between scrapings is directly\r\ndependent upon the turbidity of the raw water. The greater the\r\nturbidity, the more frequently will filters require to be scraped. In\r\nthe experiments of the Pittsburg Filtration Commission, with 4 feet of\r\nsand of an effective size of about 0.30 millimeter, and with rates of\r\nfiltration of about three million gallons per acre daily, and with the\r\nloss of head limited to 4 feet, sand filters were operated as follows:\r\nFor five periods the turbidities of the raw water ranged from 0.035 to\r\n0.062, and averaged 0.051, and the corresponding periods ranged from\r\n102 to 136, and averaged 113 million gallons per acre filtered between\r\nscrapings. For ten periods the turbidities of the raw water ranged from\r\n0.079 to 0.128, and averaged 0.102, and the periods averaged 78 million\r\ngallons per acre between scrapings. For fifteen other periods the\r\nturbidities of the raw water ranged from 0.134 to 0.269, and averaged\r\n0.195, and the periods averaged 52 million gallons per acre between\r\nscrapings. In two other periods the turbidities of the raw water\r\naveraged 0.67, and the periods between scrapings averaged 16 million\r\ngallons. In all cases the turbidity is taken as that of the water\r\napplied to the filter. Usually this was the turbidity of the settled\r\nwater, but in some cases raw water was applied, and in these case the\r\nturbidity of the raw water is taken. These results are approximately\r\nrepresented by the formula\r\n\r\n  Period between scrapings, } = 12/(turbidity + 0.05).\r\n  million gallons per acre  }\r\n\r\nExcept for very clear waters the amount of water passed between\r\nscrapings is nearly inversely proportional to the turbidity. With twice\r\nas great an amount of turbidity, filters will have to be cleaned twice\r\nas often, the reserve area for cleaning will require to be twice as\r\ngreat, and the cost of scraping filters and of washing and replacing\r\nsand, which is the most important element in the cost of operation,\r\nwill be doubled.\r\n\r\nWith waters having turbidities of 0.20 upon this basis, the average\r\nperiod will be about 51 million gallons per acre between scrapings.\r\nThis is about the average result obtained at the German works filtering\r\nriver waters, and there is no serious difficulty in operating filters\r\nwhich require to be scraped with this frequency. With more turbid\r\nwaters the period is decreased. With an average turbidity of 0.50 the\r\naverage period is only 24 million gallons per acre between scrapings, a\r\ncondition which means very difficult operation and a very high cost of\r\ncleaning. With much more turbid waters the difficulties are increased,\r\nand if the duration of turbid water should be long-continued, the\r\noperation of sand filters would clearly be impracticable, and the\r\nexpense, also, would be prohibitive.\r\n\r\nIn applying these figures to actual cases it must be borne in mind\r\nthat the turbidity is only one of the several factors which control\r\nthe length of period; and that the turbidity of a water of a given\r\nstream is never constant, but fluctuates within wide limits; and that\r\nraw water can be applied to filters for a short time without injurious\r\nresults, even though it is so turbid that its continued application\r\nwould be fatal.\r\n\r\nIt is very likely also that the suspended matters in different streams\r\ndiffer in their natures to such an extent that equal turbidities would\r\ngive quite different periods, although the Pittsburg results were so\r\nregular as to give confidence in their application to other conditions\r\nwithin reasonable limits, and when so applied they afford a most\r\nconvenient method of computing the approximate cost of operation of\r\nfilters for waters of known or estimated turbidities.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWER OF SAND FILTERS TO PRODUCE CLEAR EFFLUENTS FROM MUDDY WATER.\r\n\r\nWhen the turbidity of the applied water is not too great it is entirely\r\nremoved in the course of filtration. With extremely muddy raw waters,\r\nhowever, turbid effluents are often produced with sand filters.\r\nThe conditions which control the passage of the finest suspended\r\nmatters through filters have been studied by Mr. Fuller at Cincinnati\r\nat considerable length. They are similar in a general way to the\r\nconditions which control the removal of bacteria. That is to say, the\r\nremoval is more complete with fine filter sand than with coarse sand;\r\nwith a deep sand layer than with a shallow sand layer; and with low\r\nrates of filtration than with high rates. The practicable limits to\r\nthe size of sand grain, depth of sand layer, and rate of filtration\r\nare established by other conditions, and the question remains whether\r\nwithin these limits a clear effluent can be produced.\r\n\r\nAt Pittsburg the turbidity of the effluent from a sand filter operated\r\nas mentioned above, which received water which had passed through a\r\nsedimentation-basin holding about a 24-hours’ supply, but without\r\ntaking any advantage of storage to avoid the use of muddy water, was\r\nnearly always less than 0.02, which may be taken as the admissible\r\nlimit of turbidity in a public water-supply. This limit was exceeded on\r\nless than 20 days out of 365, these days being during the winter and\r\nspring freshets, and on these days the excess was not such as would be\r\nlikely to be particularly objectionable. For the water of the Allegheny\r\nRiver, then, sand filtration with one day’s sedimentation is capable\r\nof yielding a water not absolutely clear, but sufficiently clear to be\r\nquite satisfactory for the purpose of municipal water-supply.\r\n\r\nAt Cincinnati, on the other hand, where the amount of suspended matters\r\nwas five times as great as at Pittsburg, the effluents which could be\r\nobtained by sand filtration without recourse to the use of alum, even\r\nunder most favorable conditions, were very much more turbid than those\r\nobtained at Pittsburg, and were, in fact, so turbid as to be seriously\r\nobjectionable for the purpose of public water-supply.\r\n\r\nWith rivers no more turbid than the Allegheny River at Pittsburg, and\r\nrivers having floods of such short duration that the use of flood-flows\r\ncan be avoided by the use of reservoirs, sand filters are adequate for\r\nclarification. For waters which are much muddier than the Allegheny,\r\nas, for instance, the Ohio at Cincinnati and at Louisville, sand\r\nfiltration alone is inadequate. Mr. Fuller,[31] as a result of his\r\nCincinnati experiments, has stated the case as follows:\r\n\r\n“For the sake of explicitness it is desired to show, with the data\r\nof the fairly normal year of 1898, the proportion of the time when\r\nEnglish filters (that is, sand filters) would be inapplicable in the\r\npurification of the unsubsided Ohio River water at Cincinnati. This\r\nnecessitates fixing an average limit of permissible suspended matter in\r\nthis river water, and is a difficult matter from present evidence.\r\n\r\n“In part this is due to variations in the character and in the relative\r\namounts of the suspended silt, clay, and organic matter; and in part\r\nit is due to different amounts of clay stored in the sand layer, which\r\naffects materially the capacity of the filter to retain the clay of the\r\napplied water. During these investigations the unsubsided river-water\r\nwas not regularly applied to filters; and, with the exception of\r\nthe results of tests for a few days only, it is necessary to depend\r\nupon general information obtained with reference to this point. So\r\nfar as the information goes, it appears that an average of 125 parts\r\nper million is a conservative estimate of the amount of suspended\r\nmatters in the unsubsided river-water, which could be regularly and\r\nsatisfactorily handled by English filters. But at times this estimated\r\naverage would be too low, and at other times too high....\r\n\r\n“While English filters are able to remove satisfactorily on an\r\n\r\naverage about 125 parts of silt and clay of the unsubsided water,\r\nactual experience shows that they can regularly handle suspended\r\nclay in subsided water in amounts ranging only as high as from 30 to\r\n70 parts (depending upon the amount of the clay stored in the sand\r\nlayer), and averaging about 50 parts per million. But it is true that\r\nfor two or three days on short rises in the river, or at the beginning\r\nof long freshets, the retentive capacity of the sand layer allows of\r\nsatisfactory results with the clay in the applied water considerably in\r\nexcess of 70 parts. If this capacity is greatly overtaxed, however, the\r\nadvantage is merely temporary, as the stored clay is washed out later,\r\nproducing markedly turbid effluents.”\r\n\r\nTranslating Mr. Fuller’s results into terms of turbidity, the 125\r\nparts per million of suspended matters in the raw water represent a\r\nturbidity of about 0.40, and the 30 to 70 parts of suspended matters in\r\nthe settled water represent turbidities from 0.20 to 0.40, the average\r\nof 50 parts of suspended matters corresponding to a turbidity of about\r\n0.30.\r\n\r\nUpon this basis, then, sand filters are capable of treating raw waters\r\nwith average turbidities up to 0.40, or settled waters with average\r\nturbidities up to 0.30, but waters more turbid than this are incapable\r\nof being successfully treated without the use of coagulants or other\r\naids to the process. These results are in general accordance with\r\nthe results of the experiments at Pittsburg, and demonstrate that\r\nwhile sand filters as generally used in Europe are adequate for the\r\nclarification of many, if not most, river waters in the United States,\r\nthere are other waters carrying mud in such quantities as to make the\r\nprocess inapplicable to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF MUD UPON BACTERIAL EFFICIENCY OF FILTERS.\r\n\r\nThe question is naturally raised as to whether or not the presence of\r\nlarge quantities of mud in the raw water will not seriously interfere\r\nwith the bacterial efficiency of filters. Experiments at Cincinnati\r\nand Pittsburg have given most conclusive and satisfactory information\r\nupon this point. Up to the point where the effluents become quite\r\nturbid, the mud in the raw water has no influence upon the bacterial\r\nefficiency; and even somewhat beyond this point, with effluents so\r\nturbid that they would hardly be suitable for the purpose of a public\r\nwater-supply, the bacterial efficiency remains substantially equal to\r\nthat obtained with the clearest waters. Only in the case of excessive\r\nquantities of mud, where, for other reasons, sand filters can hardly\r\nbe considered applicable, is there a moderate reduction in bacterial\r\nefficiency. As mentioned above, particles constituting turbidity are\r\noften much smaller than the bacteria, and in addition, the bacteria\r\nprobably have an adhesive power far in excess of that of the clay\r\nparticles. For these reasons clay particles are able to pass filters\r\nunder conditions which almost entirely prevent the passage of bacteria.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it does not necessarily follow that the removal\r\nof turbidity is accompanied by high bacterial efficiency. Although\r\nthis is often the case, there are marked exceptions, particularly in\r\nconnection with the use of coagulants, where very good clarification is\r\nobtained, and notwithstanding this, effluents are produced containing\r\ncomparatively large numbers of bacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMITS TO THE USE OF SUBSIDENCE FOR THE PRELIMINARY TREATMENT OF MUDDY\r\nWATERS.\r\n\r\nWhen water is too muddy to be applied directly to filters, the most\r\nobvious treatment is to remove as much of the sediment as possible by\r\nsedimentation. Sedimentation-basins are considered as essential parts\r\nof filtration plants for the treatment of muddy waters. The effect of\r\nsedimentation, as noted above, is to remove principally the larger\r\nparticles in the raw water. By doing this the deposit upon the surface\r\nof the filters and the cost of operation are greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nThese larger particles are mainly removed by a comparatively short\r\nperiod of sedimentation, and the improvement effected after the first\r\n24 hours is comparatively slight. The particles remaining in suspension\r\nat the end of this time consist almost entirely of very fine clay, and\r\nthe rate of their settlement through the water is extremely slow; and\r\ncurrents in the basin, due to temperature changes, winds, etc., almost\r\nentirely offset the natural tendency of the sediment to fall to the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nThere is thus a practical limit to the effect of sedimentation which is\r\nsoon reached, and it has not been found feasible to extend the process\r\nso as to allow much more turbid waters to be brought within the range\r\nwhich can be economically treated by sand filtration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE COAGULATION OF WATERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coagulation of water consists in the addition to it of some\r\nsubstance which forms an inorganic precipitate in the water, the\r\npresence of which has a physical action upon the suspended matters, and\r\nallows them to be more readily removed by subsidence or filtration.\r\n\r\nThe most common coagulant is sulphate of alumina. When this substance\r\nis added to water it is decomposed into its component parts, sulphuric\r\nacid and alumina, the former of which combines with the lime or other\r\nbase present in the water, or in case enough of this is lacking, it\r\nremains partly as free acid and partly undecomposed in its original\r\ncondition; while the alumina forms a gelatinous precipitate which draws\r\ntogether and surrounds the suspended matters present in the water,\r\nincluding the bacteria, and allows them to be much more easily removed\r\nby filtration than would otherwise be the case. In addition, the\r\nalumina has a chemical attraction for dissolved organic matters, and\r\nthe chemical purification may be more complete at very high rates than\r\nwould be possible with sand filtration without coagulant at any rate,\r\nhowever low.\r\n\r\nCoagulants have been employed in connection with filtration from\r\nvery early times. As early as 1831 D’Arcet published in the “Annales\r\nd’hygiène publique,”[32] an account of the purification of Nile water\r\nin Egypt by adding alum to the water, and afterwards filtering it\r\nthrough small household filters. More recently alum has been repeatedly\r\nused in connection with sand filters, particularly\r\n\r\nat Leeuwarden, Groningen, and Schiedam in Holland, where the river\r\nwaters used for public supplies are colored by peaty matter which\r\ncannot be removed by simple filtration.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSTANCES USED FOR COAGULATION.\r\n\r\nMr. Fuller[33] has given a very full account of the substances which\r\ncan be used for the clarification of waters. Without taking up all of\r\nthe unusual substances which have been suggested, the most important of\r\nthe coagulants will be briefly described below.\r\n\r\n_Lime._—Lime has been extensively used in connection with the\r\npurification of sewage, and also for softening water. Lime is first\r\nslaked and converted into calcium hydrate, which is afterwards\r\ndissolved in water, and applied to the water under treatment. The\r\namount of lime to be used is fixed by the amount of carbonic acid in\r\nthe water. So much lime is always used as will exactly convert the\r\nwhole of the carbonic acid of the water into normal carbonate of lime.\r\nThis substance is but slightly soluble in water and it precipitates.\r\nThe precipitate is crystalline rather than flocculent, and is not as\r\nwell adapted to aid in the removal of clayey matters as some other\r\nsubstances, although its action in this respect is considerable. The\r\nprecipitate is quite heavy, and is largely removed by sedimentation,\r\nalthough filtration must be used to complete the process. Water which\r\nhas been treated with lime is slightly caustic; that is to say, there\r\nis a deficiency of carbonic acid in it, and it deposits lime in the\r\npipes, in pumps, etc.; and although the precipitated calcium carbonate\r\nis much softer than steel, it rapidly destroys pumps used for lifting\r\nit.\r\n\r\nPrincipally for these reasons it is necessary to supply carbonic acid\r\nto water which has been treated in this way, and this is done by\r\nbringing it in contact with flue-gases, or by the direct addition of\r\ncarbonic acid.\r\n\r\nThe use of lime for softening waters is known as Clark’s process. It\r\nwas patented in England many years ago, and the\r\n\r\npatent has now expired. Various ingenious devices have been constructed\r\nfor facilitating various parts of the operation. The process has hardly\r\nbeen used in the United States, but there is a large field for it in\r\nconnection with the softening of very hard waters, and where such\r\nwaters also contain iron or clay, these substances will be incidentally\r\nremoved by the process.\r\n\r\nLarger quantities of lime have an action upon the suspended matters\r\nwhich is entirely different from that secured in Clark’s process, and\r\nthe action upon bacteria is particularly noteworthy. This action was\r\nnoted in experiments at Lawrence,[34] where it was found that sewage\r\nwas almost completely sterilized by the application of considerable\r\nquantities of lime. An extremely interesting series of experiments upon\r\nthe application of large quantities of lime to water was made by Mr.\r\nFuller in 1899.[35] The bacterial results were extremely favorable,\r\nalthough the necessity for removing the excess of lime afterward is a\r\nsomewhat serious matter, and in these experiments it was not entirely\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n_Aluminum Compounds._—Sulphate of alumina is most commonly employed.\r\nIt can be obtained in a state of considerable purity at a very\r\nmoderate price, and important improvements in the methods used for its\r\nmanufacture have been recently introduced. Potash and soda alums have\r\nno advantage over sulphate of alumina, and, in fact, are less efficient\r\nper pound, while their costs are greater. Chloride of alumina is\r\npractically equivalent to the sulphate in purifying power, but is more\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\n_Sodium Aluminate_ has been examined by Mr. Fuller, who states that\r\nexperience has shown that its use is impracticable in the case of the\r\nOhio River water.\r\n\r\n_Compounds of Iron._—Iron forms two classes of compounds, namely,\r\nferrous and ferric salts. When the ferrous salts are applied to water,\r\nunder certain conditions, ferrous hydrate is precipitated, but this\r\nsubstance is not entirely insoluble in water containing carbonic acid.\r\nUnder some conditions the precipitated ferrous hydrate is oxidized\r\nby oxygen present in the water to ferric hydrate, and so far as this\r\nis the case, good results can be obtained. Ferrous sulphate is not\r\nas readily oxidized when applied to water as is the ferric carbonate\r\npresent in many natural waters, and for this reason ferrous sulphate\r\nhas not been successfully used in water purification. In the treatment\r\nof sewage, where the requirements are somewhat different, it has been\r\none of the most satisfactory coagulants.\r\n\r\nFerric sulphate acts in much the same way as sulphate of alumina,\r\nand is entirely suitable for use where sulphate of alumina could be\r\nemployed, but it has not been used in practice, due probably to its\r\nincreased cost as compared with its effect, and to the practical\r\ndifficulties of applying it in the desired quantities due to its\r\nphysical condition.\r\n\r\n_Metallic Iron: The Anderson Process._—The use of metallic iron for\r\nwater purification in connection with a moderately slow filtration\r\nthrough filters of the usual form is known as Anderson’s process\r\n(patented), and has been used at Antwerp and elsewhere on a large\r\nscale, and has been experimentally examined at a number of other places.\r\n\r\nThe process consists in agitating the water in contact with metallic\r\niron, a portion of which is taken into solution as ferrous carbonate.\r\nUpon subsequent aeration this is supposed to become oxidized and\r\nprecipitate out as ferric hydrate, with all the good and none of the\r\nbad effects which follow the use of alum. The precipitate is partially\r\nremoved by sedimentation, while filtration completes the process.\r\nThe process is admirable theoretically, and in an experimental way\r\nupon a very small scale often gives most satisfactory results, muddy\r\nwaters very difficult of filtration, and colored peaty waters yielding\r\npromptly clear and colorless effluents.\r\n\r\nIn applying the process on a larger scale, however, with peaty waters\r\nat least, it seems impossible to get enough iron to go into solution\r\nin the time which can be allowed, and the small quantity which is\r\ntaken up either remains in solution or else slowly and incompletely\r\nprecipitates out, without the good effects which follow the sudden and\r\ncomplete precipitation of a larger quantity, and in this case the color\r\nis seldom reduced, and may even be increased above the color of the raw\r\nwater by the iron remaining in solution.\r\n\r\nThe ingenuity of those who have studied the process has not yet found\r\nany adequate means of avoiding these important practical objections;\r\nand even at Antwerp a great extension of the filtering area, as well\r\nas the use of alum at times of unusual pollution, is good evidence\r\nthat simple filtration, in distinction from the effect of the iron, is\r\nrelied upon much more than formerly.\r\n\r\nAt Dordrecht also, where the process has been long in use, the rate of\r\nfiltration does not exceed the ordinary limits; nor is the result, so\r\nfar as I could ascertain, in any way superior to that obtained a few\r\nmiles away at Rotterdam, by ordinary filtration, with substantially the\r\nsame raw water.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained at Boulogne-sur-Seine, near Paris, have been\r\nclosely watched by the public chemist and bacteriologist of Paris,\r\nand have been very favorable, and a number of new plants of very\r\nconsiderable capacity have been built, to supply some of the suburbs of\r\nParis, but even in these cases only moderate rates of filtration are\r\nemployed which would yield excellent effluents without the iron.\r\n\r\n_Compounds of Manganese._—Manganese forms compounds similar to those\r\nof iron, that is to say manganous and manganic salts, but their use\r\nin connection with water filtration has not been found possible. In\r\naddition, manganese forms a series of compounds, known as manganates\r\nand permanganates, quite different in their structure and action from\r\nthe others. These compounds contain an excess of oxygen which they\r\ngive up very readily to organic matters capable of absorbing oxygen,\r\nand because of this power, they have been extensively used in the\r\ntreatment of sewage. Applied to the treatment of waters their action is\r\nvery slight, and the compounds are so expensive that they have not been\r\nemployed for this purpose. Theoretically the action is very attractive,\r\nas the oxygen liberated by their decomposition oxidizes some of the\r\norganic matter of the water, thereby purifying it in part, while the\r\nmanganese is precipitated as a flocculent precipitate having all of\r\nthe advantages pertaining to a precipitate of hydrate of alumina, and\r\nwithout the disadvantage of adding acid to the water, as is the case\r\nwith the compounds of alumina and iron. These chemicals, when used in\r\ncomparatively concentrated condition, have powerful germicidal actions,\r\nbut in water purification the amounts which can be used are so small\r\nthat no action of this kind results. The amount which can be applied to\r\na water is limited to the amount which can be decomposed by the organic\r\nmatters present in the water, and is not large.\r\n\r\n_The Use of Metallic Iron and Aluminum, with the Aid of\r\nElectricity._—Elaborate experiments were made at Louisville with\r\nmetallic iron and aluminum oxidized and made available by the aid of\r\nelectric currents. The use of iron with electric currents was tried\r\nin sewage purification some years ago, under the name of the Webster\r\nprocess, but was never put to practical use. The theory is to oxidize\r\nthe iron or aluminum in contact with the water, with the formation\r\nof flocculent hydrates, by the aid of an electric current, thereby\r\nsecuring the advantages of the application of salts of these metals to\r\nthe water without the disadvantage of the addition of acid.\r\n\r\n_Other Chemicals Employed._—A solution containing chlorine produced\r\nby electrical action has been suggested. Chlorine is a powerful\r\ndisinfectant, and when used in large quantities kills bacteria. It is\r\nnot possible to use enough chlorine to kill the bacteria in the water\r\nwithout rendering it unfit for human use. The nature of this treatment\r\nhas been concisely described by Dr. Drown,[36] who shows that the\r\nelectrically prepared fluids do not differ in their action in any way\r\nfrom well-known chemicals, the use of which would be hardly considered.\r\n\r\nThe use of ozone and peroxide of hydrogen have also been suggested, but\r\nI do not know that they have been successfully used on a large scale.\r\nThe same is true of many other chemicals, the consideration of which is\r\nhardly necessary in this connection.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAGULANTS WHICH HAVE BEEN USED.\r\n\r\nIn actual work sulphate of alumina is practically the only coagulant\r\nwhich has been employed, excepting the alums, which are practically its\r\nequivalent in action, differing only in strength. Nearly all important\r\nexperiments upon the coagulation of water have been made with sulphate\r\nof alumina, and in the further discussion of this subject only this\r\ncoagulant will be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMOUNT OF COAGULANT REQUIRED TO REMOVE TURBIDITY.\r\n\r\nIn the coagulation of turbid waters a certain definite amount of\r\ncoagulant must be employed. If less than this amount is used either no\r\nprecipitate will be formed, or it will not be formed in sufficient bulk\r\nto effect the desired results. It is necessary that the precipitate\r\nshould be sufficient, and that it should be formed practically all at\r\none time. The amount of coagulant necessary to accomplish this purpose\r\nis dependent upon the turbidity of the raw water. With practically\r\nclear waters sulphate of alumina of the ordinary commercial strength,\r\nthat is to say, with about 17 per cent soluble oxide of aluminum,\r\nused in quantities as small as 0.3 or 0.4 of a grain per gallon, will\r\nproduce coagulation. As the turbidity increases larger amounts must be\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nA special study was made of this point in connection with the Pittsburg\r\nexperiments.[37] As an average of these results it was found that two\r\ngrains per gallon of sulphate of alumina were\r\n\r\nrequired to properly coagulate waters having turbidities of 1.00, so\r\nthat they could be filtered by the Jewell filter, and 2.75 grains were\r\nrequired for the Warren filter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—AMOUNT OF COAGULANT REQUIRED TO REMOVE\r\nTURBIDITY.]\r\n\r\nAside from the amount required to produce a precipitate in the clearest\r\nwaters, the amount of coagulant required was proportional to the\r\nturbidity. As an average for the two filters the required quantity was\r\napproximately 0.30 of a grain, and in addition 0.02 of a grain for each\r\n0.01 of turbidity. Thus a water having a turbidity of 0.20 requires\r\n0.70 of a grain per gallon; a water having a turbidity of 0.50 requires\r\n1.30 grains; of 1.00, 2.30 grains; of 2.00, 4.30 grains, etc. These are\r\naverage minimum results. Occasionally clear effluents were produced\r\nwith smaller quantities of coagulant, while at other times larger\r\nquantities were necessary for satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nThe amount of coagulant required for clarification at Cincinnati has\r\nbeen stated by Mr. Fuller in his report. A number of his results are\r\nbrought together in the following table, to which has also been added a\r\ncolumn showing approximately the corresponding results at Pittsburg.\r\n\r\n\r\nESTIMATED AVERAGE AMOUNTS OF REQUIRED CHEMICAL FOR DIFFERENT GRADES OF\r\nWATER.\r\n\r\n  ----------+---------------------------------------------\r\n            |   Chemical Required, Grains per Gallon.\r\n            +----------+----------+----------+------------\r\n  Suspended |   Raw    | Subsided | Subsided |Minimum for\r\n   Matter,  |Water for |Water for |Water for |Raw Water\r\n  Parts in  |   Sand   |  Sand    |Mechanical|   for\r\n  100,000.  | Filters. | Filters. | Filters. |Mechanical\r\n            |Cincinnati|Cincinnati|Cincinnati| Filters.\r\n            |  Report, |  Report, |  Report, |\r\n            |Page 290. |Page 290. |Page 341. | Pittsburg.\r\n  ----------+----------+----------+----------+------------\r\n    1.0     |     0    |    0     |   0.75   |   0.40\r\n    2.5     |     0    |    0     |   1.25   |   0.50\r\n    5.0     |     0    |    0     |   1.50   |   0.70\r\n    7.5     |     0    |   1.30   |   1.95   |   0.90\r\n   10.0     |    1.50  |   1.60   |   2.20   |   1.00\r\n   12.5     |    1.60  |   1.80   |   2.45   |   1.15\r\n   15.0     |    1.70  |   2.00   |   2.65   |   1.30\r\n   17.5     |    1.80  |   2.10   |   2.85   |   1.40\r\n   20.0     |    1.95  |   2.20   |   3.00   |   1.60\r\n   30.0     |    2.25  |   2.45   |   3.80   |   2.00\r\n   40.0     |    2.50  |   2.75   |   4.40   |   2.50\r\n   50.0     |    2.80  |          |          |\r\n   60.0     |    3.05  |          |          |\r\n   75.0     |    3.40  |          |          |\r\n  100.0     |    4.00  |          |          |\r\n  120.0     |    4.75  |          |          |\r\n  ----------+----------+----------+----------+------------\r\n\r\nMr. Fuller’s results seem to show that a greater amount of coagulant\r\nis required for the preparation of water for mechanical filters than\r\nis necessary in connection with sand filters. The results with sand\r\nfilters indicate that settled waters and raw waters containing equal\r\namounts of suspended matters are about equally difficult to treat. The\r\nresults at Pittsburg indicate that the raw waters required much smaller\r\nquantities of coagulant for given amounts of suspended matters than was\r\nthe case with subsided waters at Cincinnati, the results agreeing more\r\nclosely with the amounts required to prepare raw water for sand filters\r\nat Cincinnati.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMOUNT OF COAGULANT REQUIRED TO REMOVE COLOR.\r\n\r\nThe information upon this point is, unfortunately, very inadequate. In\r\nsome experiments made by Mr. E. B. Weston at Providence in 1893 with a\r\nmechanical filter,[38] with quantities of sulphate of alumina averaging\r\n0.6 or 0.7 of a grain per gallon, the removal of color was usually\r\nfrom 70 to 90 per cent. The standard used for the measurement of color\r\nis not stated, and there is no statement of the basis of the scale,\r\nconsequently no means of determining the absolute color of the raw\r\nwater upon standards commonly used.\r\n\r\nAt Westerly, R. I., with a New York filter, the actual quantity of\r\npotash alum employed from Oct. 10, 1896, to March 1, 1897, was 1.94\r\ngrains per gallon, the amount being regulated to as low a figure as it\r\nwas possible to use to secure satisfactory decolorization. There is no\r\nrecord of the color of the raw water. A very rough estimate would place\r\nit at 0.50 upon the platinum scale. The chemical employed in this case\r\nwas alum, and two thirds as large a quantity of sulphate of alumina\r\nwould probably have done corresponding work, had suitable apparatus for\r\napplying it been at hand.\r\n\r\nAt Superior, Wisconsin, the water in the bay coming from the St.\r\nLouis River, having a color of 2.40 platinum scale, was treated\r\nexperimentally with quantities of sulphate of alumina up to 4 grains\r\nper gallon, by Mr. R. S. Weston in January, 1899, but even this\r\nquantity of coagulant utterly failed to coagulate and decolorize it.\r\n\r\nAt Greenwich, Conn., during 1898 the average amount of sulphate of\r\nalumina employed, as computed from quantities stated in the annual\r\nreport of the Connecticut State Board of Health for 1898, was about\r\n0.44 of a grain per gallon, and this quantity sufficed to reduce the\r\ncolor of the raw water from 0.40 to 0.30, platinum standard. This\r\nreduction is very slight, and it is obvious that this quantity of\r\ncoagulant was not enough for decolorization.\r\n\r\nSome experiments bearing on color removal were made at East Providence,\r\nR. I., by Mr. E. B. Weston, and are described in the Proceedings of the\r\nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers for September, 1899. In this case\r\nthe color is reported to have been reduced from 0.58 to 0.10 platinum\r\nstandard by the use of one grain of sulphate of alumina, containing 22\r\nper cent of effective alumina, equivalent to about 1.30 grains of the\r\nordinary article per gallon.\r\n\r\nThe various experiments seem to indicate that a removal from 80 to\r\n90 per cent of the color can be effected by the use of a quantity of\r\nsulphate of alumina equal to rather more than two grains per gallon\r\nfor waters having colors of 1.00, platinum standard, and proportionate\r\nquantities for more and less deeply colored waters. With much less\r\nsulphate of alumina decolorization is not effected, and even larger\r\nquantities do not remove all of the color.\r\n\r\nThe data are much less complete than could be desired, and it is to be\r\nhoped that experiments will be undertaken to throw more light upon this\r\nimportant subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESSIVE APPLICATION OF COAGULANT.\r\n\r\nMr. Fuller, in his experiments at Louisville, has ascertained that when\r\nsulphate of alumina is added to extremely muddy water the sediment\r\nabsorbs some of the chemical before it has time to decompose, and\r\ncarries it to the bottom, and so far as this is the case, no benefit\r\nis derived from that part of the coagulant which is absorbed. In other\r\nwords, it is necessary to add more coagulant than would otherwise be\r\nnecessary because of this action. The data showed that different kinds\r\nof suspended matters took up very different amounts of coagulant in\r\nthis way. With only moderately turbid waters the loss of chemical\r\nfrom this source is unimportant. Hardly any trace of it was found at\r\nPittsburg with the Allegheny River water. At Louisville, however, it\r\nwas an important factor, as shown by Mr. Fuller’s results.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this loss of chemical Mr. Fuller has suggested the removal of\r\nthe greater part of the suspended matters by sedimentation, without\r\nchemicals, or with the aid of a small quantity of chemical, followed by\r\nthe application of the final coagulant prior to filtration. With the\r\nworst waters encountered at Louisville the saving in coagulant to be\r\neffected in this way is very great.\r\n\r\nMr. Fuller states in “Water Purification at Louisville,” p. 417: “The\r\npractical conclusions to be drawn from this experience are that with\r\npreliminary coagulation, followed by subsidence for a period of about\r\nthree hours, the application of coagulants may be divided to advantage,\r\nand a considerable portion of the suspended matter kept off the filter,\r\nwhen the total amount of required coagulant ranges from 2 to 2.5\r\ngrains or more of ordinary sulphate of alumina per gallon. In the case\r\nof a water requiring more than this amount of coagulating treatment,\r\na proper division of the application would increase the saving of\r\ncoagulants and would diminish the frequency of washing the filter.”\r\n\r\nIn his final summary and conclusions, page 441, Mr. Fuller estimates\r\nthe amount of sulphate of alumina required for the clarification of the\r\nOhio River at Louisville at 3.00 grains per gallon of water filtered\r\nif all applied at one point, or at 1.75 grains by taking advantage of\r\nsubsidence to its economical limit prior to the final coagulation. The\r\nsaving to be effected in this way is sufficient to justify the works\r\nnecessary to allow it to be carried out. With less turbid waters, or\r\nwaters highly turbid for only short intervals, the advantages of double\r\ncoagulation would be less apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMOUNT OF COAGULANT WHICH VARIOUS WATERS WILL RECEIVE.\r\n\r\nThe amount of coagulant which can be safely used is dependent upon\r\nthe alkalinity of the raw water. When sulphate of alumina is added\r\nto water it is decomposed, as explained above, with the formation\r\nof alumina, which is alone useful in the work of purification, and\r\nsulphuric acid, which combines with the calcium carbonate or lime\r\npresent in the water. There should always be an excess of alkalinity or\r\nlime in the raw water. If for any reason there is not, there is nothing\r\nto combine with the liberated sulphuric acid, and the decomposition of\r\nthe coagulant is not complete, and a portion of it goes undecomposed\r\ninto the effluent. The effluent then has an acid reaction, and is unfit\r\nfor domestic supply. When distributed through iron pipes, it attacks\r\nthe iron, rusting the pipes, and giving rise to all the disagreeable\r\nconsequences of an iron containing water.\r\n\r\nThe amount of lime in a water available to combine with the sulphuric\r\nacid can be determined by a very simple chemical operation, namely,\r\nby titration with standard acid with a suitable indicator. The amount\r\nof coagulant corresponding to a given quantity of lime can be readily\r\nand accurately calculated, but it is not regarded safe to use as\r\nmuch sulphate of alumina as corresponds to the lime. The quantity of\r\ncoagulant used is not susceptible to exact control, but fluctuates\r\nsomewhat, and if the exact theoretical quantity should be employed\r\nduring 24 hours, there would surely be an excess during some portion of\r\nthat time from which bad results would be experienced. It is therefore\r\nconsidered only prudent to use three quarters as much sulphate of\r\nalumina as corresponds to the lime in the water. With sulphate of\r\nalumina containing 17 per cent of soluble aluminum oxide and the\r\ncorresponding amount of sulphuric acid, the amount which can be applied\r\nto a water in grains per gallon is slightly less than the alkalinity\r\nexpressed in terms of parts in 100,000 of calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\nMany waters contain sufficient lime to combine with the acid of all\r\nthe coagulant which is necessary for their coagulation. Others will\r\nnot, and it thus becomes an important matter to determine whether a\r\ngiven water is capable of decomposing sufficient coagulant for its\r\ntreatment. It is usually the flood-flows of rivers which control in\r\nthis respect. The water at such times requires much larger quantities\r\nof coagulant for its clarification, and it also usually contains much\r\nless lime than the low-water flows. The reason for this is obviously\r\nthat the water of the flood-flows is largely rain-water which has come\r\nover the surface without coming into very intimate contact with the\r\nsoil, and consequently without having taken from it much lime, while\r\nthe low-water flows contain a considerable proportion of water which\r\nhas percolated through the soil and has thus become charged with lime.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the country, as, for instance, in New England, the\r\nsoil and underlying rock are almost entirely free from lime, and\r\nrivers from such watersheds are capable of receiving only very small\r\nquantities of coagulant without injurious results.\r\n\r\nThe deficiency of alkalinity in raw water can be corrected by the\r\naddition to it of lime or of soda-ash. Lime has been used for this\r\npurpose in many cases. When used only in moderate amounts it hardens\r\nthe water, and is thus seriously objectionable. The use of so large a\r\nquantity as would precipitate out, as in Clark’s process, has not been\r\nemployed in practice. If it should be attempted, the amount of lime\r\nwould require to be very accurately controlled, and the effluent would\r\nhave to be treated with carbonic acid to make it suitable for supply.\r\n\r\nWaters so hard as to require the use of the Clark process almost always\r\nhave sufficient alkalinity, and do not require to be treated with lime\r\nin connection with the use of sulphate of alumina.\r\n\r\nThe use of soda-ash is free from the objections to the use of lime,\r\nbut is more expensive, and would require to be used with caution. Its\r\nuse has often been suggested, but I do not know that it has ever been\r\nemployed in practice. In small works the use of a filtering material\r\ncontaining marble-dust, or other calcareous matter, would seem to have\r\nsome advantages in case of deficiency of alkalinity, although it would\r\nharden the water so treated.\r\n\r\nThe alkalinities of a number of waters computed as parts in 100,000 of\r\ncalcium carbonate (approximately equal to the safe doses of sulphate to\r\nalumina in grains per gallon) are as follows:\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------+--------+--------+--------\r\n                                       |Maximum.|Minimum.|Average.\r\n  -------------------------------------+--------+--------+--------\r\n  Boston water, 1898                   |  2.87  |  0.33  |  1.08\r\n  Conestoga Creek, Lancaster, Penn.    | 12.20  |  3.70  |  6.80\r\n  Allegheny River, Pittsburg           |  8.00  |  1.02  |  2.90\r\n  Mahoning River and tributaries, 1897 | 20.00  |  2.20  | 10.00\r\n  Scioto River and tributaries, 1897   | 35.00  | 10.00  | 20.00\r\n  Ohio River, Cincinnati, 1898         |  7.00  |  2.00  |  4.50\r\n  Ohio River, Louisville               | 10.87  |  2.12  |  6.70\r\n  Lake Erie, Lorain, Ohio              |        |        |  9.50\r\n  Lake Michigan, Chicago               |        |        | 11.50\r\n  -------------------------------------+--------+--------+--------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL FILTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term mechanical filters is used to designate a general class of\r\nfilters differing in many respects quite radically from the sand\r\nfilters previously described. They had their origin in the United\r\nStates, and consisted originally of iron or wooden cylinders filled\r\nwith sand through which the water was forced at rates of one to two\r\nhundred million gallons per acre daily, or from fifty to one hundred\r\ntimes the rates usually employed with sand filters. These filters were\r\nfirst used in paper-mills to remove from the large volumes of water\r\nrequired the comparatively large particles, which would otherwise\r\naffect the appearance and texture of the paper; and in their earlier\r\nforms they were entirely inadequate to remove the finer particles,\r\nsuch as the bacteria, and the clay particles which constitute the\r\nturbidity of river waters. Various improvements in construction have\r\nsince been made, and, in connection with the use of coagulants, much\r\nmore satisfactory results can now be obtained with filters of this\r\nclass; and their use has been extended from manufacturing operations to\r\nmunicipal supplies, in many cases with most satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nThe information gathered in regard to the conditions essential to the\r\nsuccessful design and operation of these filters in the last few years\r\nis very great, and may be briefly reviewed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVIDENCE EXPERIMENTS.[39]\r\n\r\nThe first data of importance were secured from a series of experiments\r\nconducted by Mr. Edmund B. Weston of Providence, R. I., in 1893 and\r\n1894, upon the Pawtuxet river water used by\r\n\r\nthat city. The experimental filter was 30 inches in diameter, and had\r\na layer of sand 2 feet 10 inches deep. The sand was washed by the use\r\nof a reverse current, the sand being stirred by a revolving rake at the\r\nsame time. The amount of coagulant employed was about 0.7 of a grain\r\nper gallon. The raw water was practically free from turbidity, and the\r\nfilter was operated to remove color and bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe removal of color, as stated in Mr. Weston’s report, amounted to\r\nfrom 70 to 90 per cent. The experiments extended over a period of\r\nten months. The rate of filtration employed was about 128 million\r\ngallons per acre daily. The bacterial results of the first six months’\r\noperations were rejected by Mr. Weston on account of defective methods\r\nof manipulation.\r\n\r\nDuring the period from November 17, 1893, to January 30, 1894, the\r\naverage bacterial efficiency of filtration was about 95 per cent, and\r\nthe manipulation was considered to be in every respect satisfactory.\r\nThe efficiency was occasionally below 90 per cent, but for four\r\nselected weeks was as high as 98.6 per cent. The average amount of\r\nsulphate of alumina used, as calculated from Mr. Weston’s tables, was\r\ntwo thirds of a grain per gallon. The highest efficiency followed the\r\napplication of a solution of caustic soda to the filtering material.\r\nThe first day following this treatment the bacterial efficiency was\r\nabove 99 per cent. Afterwards it decreased until January 30, when the\r\nexperiments were stopped. The high bacterial efficiency following the\r\nuse of caustic soda was of such short duration as to suggest very\r\ngrave doubts as to its practical value. It is extremely unfortunate\r\nthat the experiments stopped only a week after this experiment, and\r\nthe results were never repeated. I consider that the average bacterial\r\nefficiency of about 95 per cent obtained for the period of October 17\r\nto January 30, when the manipulation was considered to be in every way\r\nsatisfactory, more nearly represents what can be obtained under these\r\nconditions than the results for certain periods, particularly after the\r\nuse of the caustic soda.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUISVILLE EXPERIMENTS.[40]\r\n\r\nThese experiments were inaugurated by the Louisville Water Company\r\nin connection with the manufacturers of certain patented filters.\r\nMr. Charles Hermany, Chief Engineer of the Company, had general\r\ncharge of the experiments. Mr. George W. Fuller was Chief Chemist and\r\nBacteriologist and had direct charge of the work and has made a most\r\nelaborate report upon the same. In these examinations many devices were\r\ninvestigated; but the two which particularly deserve our attention are\r\nthe filters known as the Warren Filter and the Jewell Filter.\r\n\r\nThese filters were operated for two periods, namely, from October\r\n18, 1895, to July 30, 1896, and from April 5 to July 24, 1897. The\r\ninvestigations were directed toward the clarification of the river\r\nwater from the mud, and to the removal of bacteria. The water was\r\nsubstantially free from color. The character of the water at this\r\npoint was such that in its best condition at least three fourths of\r\na grain of sulphate of alumina were necessary for its coagulation,\r\nand with this and with larger quantities of coagulant fair bacterial\r\npurification was nearly always obtained. The problem studied\r\ntherefore was principally that of clarification from mud. The average\r\nefficiencies, as shown by the total averages, (page 248,) were as\r\nfollows: Warren filter, bacterial efficiency, 96.7 per cent; Jewell\r\nfilter, 96.0 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORAIN TESTS.[41]\r\n\r\nThese tests were made by the author of a set of Jewell filters at\r\nLorain, Ohio. The filters were six in number, each 17 feet in diameter,\r\nhaving an effective filtering area of 226 square feet each, or 1356\r\nsquare feet in all. The construction of the filters was in all respects\r\nsimilar to the Jewell filter used at Louisville. The raw water was from\r\nLake Erie, and during the examination was\r\n\r\nalways comparatively clear, but contained considerable numbers of\r\nbacteria. The problem was thus entirely one of bacterial efficiency.\r\nThe question of clarification hardly presented itself. Although\r\nthe water became turbid at times it did not approach in muddiness\r\nthe condition of the Ohio River water, and an amount of coagulant\r\nsufficient for a tolerable bacterial efficiency in all cases was more\r\nthan sufficient for clarification.\r\n\r\nA summary of the results obtained is as follows:\r\n\r\n  -----------+--------------+-----------+--------+---------+----------\r\n             | Average Rate |Sulphate of|        |         |Bacterial\r\n  Week Ending|of Filtration,| Alumina,  |Bacteria|Bacteria |Efficiency\r\n  6:00 P.M.  | Gallons per  |Grains per | in Lake|   in    |per cent.\r\n             | Sq.

The operation of the filters extended from January to\r\nAugust, 1898. A Jewell and a Warren filter were used similar in design\r\nto those used at Louisville. The raw water contained large numbers of\r\nbacteria, and was also often very turbid, although less turbid than at\r\nLouisville. At times more coagulant was necessary for clarification\r\nthan was required for bacterial efficiency; while as a rule more was\r\nrequired for satisfactory bacterial purification than was necessary for\r\nclarification. The opportunities were therefore favorable for the study\r\nof both of these conditions. The amount of coagulant necessary for\r\nclarification has been mentioned in connection with coagulation.\r\n\r\nThe results secured upon the relation of the quantity of\r\n\r\ncoagulant to the number of bacteria in the effluent were more complete\r\nthan any other experiments available, and are therefore here reproduced\r\nfrom the Pittsburg report nearly in full.\r\n\r\nIt was found that the amount of sulphate of alumina employed was\r\nmore important than any other factor in determining the bacterial\r\nefficiency, and special experiments were made to establish the effect\r\nof more and of less coagulant than used in the ordinary work. These\r\nexperiments were made upon the Warren filter during May, and with\r\nthe Jewell filter during June. The monthly averages for these months\r\nare thus abnormal and are not to be considered. The remaining six\r\nmonths for each filter may be taken as normal and as representing\r\napproximately the work of these filters under ordinary careful working\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nDuring the six months when the Warren filter was in normal order the\r\nraw water contained 11,531 bacteria and the effluent 201, the average\r\nbacterial efficiency being 98.26 per cent. The bacterial efficiency was\r\nvery constant, ranging only, by months, from 97.48 to 98.96 per cent.\r\nDuring the same period a sand filter receiving the same water yielded\r\nan effluent having an average of 105 bacteria per cubic centimeter.\r\n\r\nThe Jewell filter, for the six months in which it was in normal order,\r\nreceived raw water containing an average of 11,481 bacteria and yielded\r\nan effluent containing an average of 293, the bacterial efficiency\r\nbeing 97.45 per cent, and ranging, in different months, from 93.23 to\r\n98.61 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASTING EFFLUENT AFTER WASHING FILTERS.\r\n\r\nAfter washing a mechanical filter the effluent for the first few\r\nminutes is often inferior in quality to that obtained at other times,\r\nand if samples are taken at these times and averaged with other samples\r\ntaken during the run, an apparent efficiency may be obtained inferior\r\nto the true efficiency. To guard against this source of error, whenever\r\nsamples have been taken at such times, the average work for the day\r\nhas been taken, not as the numerical average of the results, but each\r\nsample has been given weight in proportion to the amount of time which\r\nit could be taken as representing; so that the results represent as\r\nnearly as possible the average number of bacteria in the effluent for\r\nthe whole run. As a matter of fact, however, comparatively few samples\r\nwere taken during these periods of reduced efficiency, and thus most of\r\nthe results represent the normal efficiency exclusive of this period. A\r\nstudy has been made, however, of the results of examinations of samples\r\ntaken directly after washing, somewhat in detail. The following is a\r\ntabular statement of the average results obtained from each filter by\r\nmonths, including only the results obtained on those days when samples\r\nwere taken within twenty minutes after washing, the results of other\r\ndays being excluded.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVERAGE NUMBER OF BACTERIA IN EFFLUENT.\r\n\r\n  --------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------\r\n                |  Shown by  | Within Ten  |  11 to 20   |  More than\r\n                |    Record  |Minutes after|Minutes after|   Twenty\r\n                |  Sheets.   |  Washing.   |  Washing.   |Minutes after\r\n                |            |             |             |  Washing.\r\n  --------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------\r\n  WARREN FILTER.|            |             |             |\r\n  February      |    115     |             |     118     |     114\r\n  March         |    316     |      50     |     515     |     301\r\n  April         |     79     |     417     |     207     |      75\r\n  May           |          (Special experiments, omitted.)\r\n  June          |    197     |     493     |     272     |     170\r\n  July          |    300     |             |     546     |     207\r\n  August        |    174     |     356     |     601     |     223\r\n                |            |             |             |\r\n  JEWELL FILTER.|            |             |             |\r\n  February      |   2453     |    2425     |             |    2099\r\n  March         |    455     |     657     |     958     |     354\r\n  April         |     99     |     665     |     462     |     165\r\n  May           |    144     |     998     |     346     |     127\r\n  June          |          (Special experiments, omitted.)\r\n  July          |    279     |    1330     |     272     |     274\r\n  August        |    344     |     612     |     323     |     376\r\n  --------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------\r\n\r\nThe time of inferior work very rarely exceeded twenty minutes. It\r\nwill be seen from the tables that the results as shown by the record\r\nsheets are never very much higher, and are occasionally lower than the\r\nresults of samples taken on corresponding days more than twenty minutes\r\nafter washing; and thus while a decrease in bacterial efficiency was\r\nnoted after washing, no material increase in the average bacterial\r\nefficiency of the mechanical filters would have been obtained if these\r\nresults had been excluded. The results for the whole time would be\r\naffected much less than is indicated by the table, because the table\r\nincludes only results of those days when samples were taken just after\r\nwashing, while the much larger number of days when no such samples were\r\ntaken would show no change whatever.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that these inferior effluents after washing\r\nshould be wasted. Such a procedure would mean wasting probably on\r\nan average two per cent of the water filtered, and a corresponding\r\nincrease in the cost of filtering. Mr. Fuller[43] in his Louisville\r\nreport comes to the conclusion that with adequate washing and\r\ncoagulation it is unnecessary to waste any effluent, and that inferior\r\nresults after washing usually indicate incomplete washing. While our\r\nexperiments certainly indicate a reduction in efficiency after washing\r\nso regular and persistent as to make it doubtful whether incomplete\r\nwashing can be the cause of it, it may be questioned whether or\r\nnot wasting the effluent would be necessary or desirable in actual\r\noperation. At any rate the results as given in this report are not\r\nmaterially influenced by this factor.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF AMOUNT OF SULPHATE OF ALUMINA ON BACTERIAL EFFICIENCY OF\r\nMECHANICAL FILTERS.\r\n\r\nThe number of bacteria passing a mechanical filter is dependent\r\nprincipally upon the amount of sulphate of alumina used; and by using\r\na larger quantity of sulphate of alumina than was actually used in the\r\nexperiments the bacterial efficiency could be considerably increased.\r\nTo investigate this point, the results obtained each day with each\r\nof the mechanical filters were arranged in the order of the sulphate\r\nof alumina quantities used, and averaged by classes. In this and the\r\nfollowing tables a few abnormal results were omitted.[44] A summary of\r\nthe results is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS WITH WARREN MECHANICAL FILTER, ARRANGED ACCORDING

noticed by referring to the tables that as the sulphate of\r\nalumina quantities increased the turbidities increased and the numbers\r\nof bacteria increased, as well as the bacterial efficiencies. That\r\nis to say, with the less turbid waters, small sulphate of alumina\r\nquantities have been used, the numbers of bacteria in the raw water\r\nhave been low, and the bacterial efficiencies have also been low. With\r\nturbid waters much larger quantities of sulphate of alumina have been\r\nused, the raw water has contained more bacteria, and the bacterial\r\nefficiencies have been higher. It may be then that the increased\r\nefficiencies with increased quantities of sulphate of alumina are not\r\ndue alone to the increased sulphate of alumina, but in part also to\r\nother conditions. Thus it may be easier to remove a large percentage of\r\nbacteria from a water containing many than from a water containing only\r\na few.\r\n\r\nTo investigate this matter and eliminate the influence of turbidity and\r\nnumbers of bacteria in the raw water, the results were first classified\r\nwith reference to turbidity. The results with waters having turbidities\r\nof 0.10 or less, and called for convenience turbid waters, are arranged\r\nby alum quantities as before. Afterwards the results obtained with\r\nturbidities from 0.11 to 0.50, and called for convenience muddy\r\nwaters, are grouped; and finally the results with turbid water having\r\nturbidities of 0.51 and over, and called for convenience thick waters.\r\nThe results thus arranged are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n SUMMARY OF RESULTS WITH WARREN MECHANICAL FILTER, ARRANGED ACCORDING\r\n TO TURBIDITIES AND

----------+----------+---------+-----------+-------------------------\r\n\r\nIt appears from this table that waters of various degrees of turbidity\r\ngive substantially equal bacterial efficiencies with equal quantities\r\nof sulphate of alumina, the results varying as often in one direction\r\nas the other. Within certain limits it may thus be said that turbidity\r\nis without influence upon the bacterial efficiency obtained in\r\nmechanical filtration.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind, however, that the quantities of sulphate\r\nof alumina, with very few exceptions, were sufficient to produce\r\nfull coagulation. Mr. Fuller has shown in his Louisville report that\r\nconsiderable quantities of sulphate of alumina may be added to turbid\r\nwaters without producing appreciable coagulation; and therefore if\r\na quantity of sulphate of alumina sufficient to produce a certain\r\nbacterial efficiency in a clear water should be added to a water so\r\nturbid that it was unable to coagulate it, scarcely any effect would\r\nbe produced. The above statement therefore only applies in those cases\r\nwhere sufficient sulphate of alumina is used to adequately coagulate\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nAs the numbers of bacteria often vary with the turbidity, the variation\r\nin the numbers of bacteria in the different classes is much less than\r\nin the first tables; but to further investigate the question of whether\r\nthe numbers of bacteria in the raw water have an important influence\r\nupon the bacterial efficiencies, each of the two largest classes in the\r\nforegoing tables was divided into two parts, according to the bacterial\r\nnumbers in the raw water, namely, the results from the Jewell filter\r\nwith turbid waters and with sulphate of alumina quantities ranging from\r\n0.75 to 1.00 grain per gallon, and the results from the Warren filter\r\nwith turbid waters and with sulphate of alumina quantities of 1.25\r\ngrains per gallon and upward. The results are as follows:\r\n\r\n  ------------+----------+--------------------+----------+--------+-----------\r\n              |          |                    |          |        |Sulphate\r\n  Number      |          |      Bacteria.     |          |        |of Alumina\r\n  of Days     |Turbidity.+----------+---------+ Per cent |Per cent|used Grains\r\n  Represented.|          |Raw Water.|Effluent.|remaining.|removed.|per Gallon.\r\n  ------------+----------+----------+---------+----------+--------+-----------\r\n                                   JEWELL FILTER.\r\n       14     |   0.05   |   3,938  |    81   |   2.06   | 97.94  |   0.88\r\n       13     |   0.07   |   7,827  |   167   |   2.13   | 97.87  |   0.87\r\n                                   WARREN FILTER.\r\n       15     |   0.06   |   3,545  |    59   |   1.66   | 98.34  |   1.67\r\n       14     |   0.06   |  20,022  |   265   |   1.32   | 98.68  |   1.48\r\n  ------------+----------+----------+---------+----------+--------+-----------\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the bacterial efficiencies are substantially\r\nthe same, with the lower and with the higher numbers of bacteria in\r\nthe raw water. That is to say, other things being equal, as the number\r\nof bacteria increase in the raw water the number of bacteria in the\r\neffluent increase in the same ratio. A further analysis of other groups\r\nof results would perhaps show variations in one direction or the other,\r\nbut on the whole it is believed that the comparison is a fair one, and\r\nthat there is no well-marked tendency for bacterial efficiencies of\r\nmechanical filters to increase or decrease with increasing numbers of\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVERAGE RESULTS OBTAINED WITH VARIOUS QUANTITIES OF SULPHATE OF ALUMINA.\r\n\r\nAs it appears that neither the turbidity nor the number of bacteria in\r\nthe raw water has a material influence upon the percentage bacterial\r\nefficiency obtained, we can take the results given above, which\r\ninclude all the results obtained (except a very few abnormal ones) for\r\ncomputing the various efficiencies obtained with various quantities of\r\nsulphate of alumina. These results are graphically shown by Fig. 21, p.\r\n167, on which lines have been drawn indicating the normal efficiencies\r\nfrom various quantities of sulphate of alumina as deduced from our\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nIn computing the amount of sulphate of alumina which it would be\r\nnecessary to use in operating a plant at a given place to give these\r\nefficiencies, the quantities of sulphate of alumina shown by the\r\ndiagram can be taken as those which it would be necessary to use during\r\nthose days in the year when the raw water was clear, or sufficiently\r\nclear, so that the amounts of sulphate of alumina mentioned would\r\nsuffice to properly coagulate it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPES OF MECHANICAL FILTERS.\r\n\r\nSections of the Warren and Jewell filters used at Pittsburg are\r\npresented herewith. The filters here shown are practically identical\r\nwith those used at Lorain and Louisville, and nearly all the exact\r\ninformation regarding mechanical filters relates to filters of these\r\ntypes. These sections show clearly the constructions used at Pittsburg\r\nand Louisville, but there are some points in connection with the\r\ndesigns of these filters which require to be considered more in detail.\r\n\r\nThe simplest idea of a mechanical filter is a tub, with sand in the\r\nbottom and some form of drainage system. Water is run over the sand,\r\npasses through it, and is collected by the drainage system. When the\r\nsand becomes clogged it is washed by the use of a reverse current of\r\nwater. This reverse current of water is so rapid as to preclude the use\r\nof a drainage system consisting of gravel, tile-drains, etc., such as\r\nare used in sand filters operated at lower rates, and instead metallic\r\nstrainers in some form are used. The sand comes directly against these\r\nstrainers, which are made as coarse as it is possible to have them,\r\nwithout allowing the sand to pass.\r\n\r\nThe rate of washing is usually from five to seven gallons per square\r\nfoot per minute. In the Warren filter the openings in the strainers at\r\nthe bottom are 6 to 8 per cent of the total area, and during washing\r\nthe water has an average velocity of 0.20 foot per second upward\r\nthrough them. This velocity is so slow that the friction of the water\r\nin passing through the openings in the screen is practically nothing.\r\nA result of this is that if there is any unequal resistance of the\r\nsand to the water, the bulk of the water goes up at the points of least\r\nresistance in the sand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—SECTION OF JEWELL MECHANICAL FILTER USED IN\r\nPITTSBURG EXPERIMENTS.]\r\n\r\nThis tendency would be fatal were it not for the revolving rake which\r\nloosens and mixes the sand and largely corrects it. The correction,\r\nhowever, is imperfect, and some parts of the filter are washed more\r\nthan others.\r\n\r\nThe rake is also necessary to prevent the separation of sand into\r\ncoarser and finer particles. It is practically impossible to get\r\nfilter sand the grains of which are all of the same size. When a filter\r\nis washed the tendency is for the wash water to go up in limited areas.\r\nThe larger sand grains tend to collect at these points while the\r\nfiner grains collect in places where there is no upward current, or\r\nwhere it is less rapid. In many filters this tendency is very strong.\r\nThe revolving rake is necessary to correct it, and to keep the sand\r\nthoroughly mixed, otherwise when a filter is put in operation after\r\nwashing, the frictional resistance through the coarse sand being less,\r\nthe bulk of the water goes through it, with the result that a part of\r\nthe area, and the part which is least efficient as a filter, passes\r\nnearly all of the water, and with inferior results.\r\n\r\nIn the Jewell filter provision is made for the distribution of the wash\r\nwater over the whole area in another way. The strainers have areas at\r\nthe surface amounting to 1.2 to 1.4 per cent of the whole area, but\r\nthe water before reaching them passes through throats much smaller in\r\nsize than the strainer outlets, and amounting in the aggregate to only\r\nabout 0.07 per cent of the filter area. When washing at a rate of seven\r\ngallons per square foot per minute, water passes through these necks\r\nat a velocity of 22 feet per second. The friction and velocity head in\r\npassing these necks is estimated to be about 30 vertical feet, and is\r\nso much greater than the friction of the outlets proper, and of the\r\nsand, that the water passes through each strainer with approximately\r\nthe same velocity, and the wash water is equally distributed over the\r\nwhole area of the bottom of the filter.\r\n\r\nThis result is accomplished, however, at a great loss of head in the\r\nwash water. When a filter is washed from the pressure-mains without\r\nseparate pumping, the pressure is usually sufficient and there is no\r\ndisadvantage in the arrangement. When, however, the water is specially\r\npumped for washing, the required head is much greater than would\r\notherwise be necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MECHANICAL FILTERS AT ELMIRA, N. Y. OUTLET TO FILTERS\r\nWITH CONTROLLER AND PURE-WATER FLUME.\r\n\r\n  [_To face page 174._]\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt would not be possible to increase the size of the necks, thereby\r\ndecreasing the friction, without increasing very largely the size\r\nof the pipes in the underdrainage system into which the strainers are\r\nfastened. These pipes are so small that during washing the velocity in\r\nthem is about 13 feet per second, and if the throats of the necks were\r\nincreased without also enlarging these pipes, the friction would be so\r\nreduced that most of the water would go through the necks nearest the\r\nsupply, thus failing to reach the object to be attained.\r\n\r\nA more rational system would be to increase the sizes of all the\r\nwaterways in the outlet and wash-water system. The Jewell filter is\r\nalso provided with a rake to keep the sand mixed during washing, as\r\nthis is necessary even with the complete distribution of wash-water\r\nover the area of the filter.\r\n\r\nBoth the Warren and the Jewell filters are provided with receptacles\r\nthrough which the water passes after receiving the coagulant, and\r\nbefore entering the filter. In the Jewell filter the receptacle, called\r\na sedimentation-basin, is of such size as to hold as much water as is\r\nfiltered in 15 minutes. In the Warren filter the receptacle is entirely\r\nindependent and larger, holding about an hour’s supply.\r\n\r\nThe rates of filtration used in the experiments have ranged from less\r\nthan 100 to about 130 million gallons per acre daily. To employ a rate\r\nmuch higher than this involves the use of a much coarser sand, or an\r\nincrease in the height of water upon the filter to an impracticable\r\nextent. There would seem to be no material advantage in the use of\r\nlower rates within certain limits, while the cost of filters would be\r\ngreatly increased.\r\n\r\nThe sand used in the Warren filters has been crushed quartz. In the\r\nJewell filters a silicious sand from Red Wing, Minn., with rounded\r\ngrains has been used. These sands are somewhat coarser than are\r\ncommonly used in sand filters, and the uniformity coefficients are\r\nvery low. It is necessary to use sand with the very lowest uniformity\r\ncoefficients to avoid the separation of sand particles according to\r\nsizes as mentioned above, and for this reason the sand must be\r\nselected with much greater care than is required for sand filters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN JUST ABOVE COPPER.\r\n\r\nSECTION SHOWING FILTER DURING ORDINARY OPERATION.\r\n\r\nFIG. 23.—WARREN FILTER: PITTSBURG EXPERIMENTS. SECTION NO. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF AGITATOR, GUTTER CASTINGS, ETC.\r\n\r\nSECTION SHOWING FILTER DURING OPERATION OF WASHING.\r\n\r\nFIG. 24.—WARREN FILTER: PITTSBURG EXPERIMENTS. SECTION NO. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe round-grained sand is more readily and completely washed than the\r\nangular crushed quartz. It has been claimed that the crushed quartz is\r\nmore efficient as a filtering material, but the evidence of this is not\r\nvery clear.\r\n\r\nThe amount of water filtered by a filter between washings is, in a\r\ngeneral way, about the same as that filtered by a sand filter between\r\nscrapings, in relation to its area. The amount of water required for\r\nwashing is, on an average, about equal to a vertical column 5 or 6\r\nfeet high equal in area to the area of the filter, exclusive of water\r\non the top of the filter wasted before the current is reversed. With\r\nclear waters, as for instance, the Allegheny at low water, the amount\r\nof washing is almost directly proportional to the amount of sulphate\r\nof alumina used. With muddy waters the sulphate of alumina required is\r\nproportional to the mud, and the frequency of washing and the amount of\r\nwash-water are proportional to both. The amount of wash-water required\r\naverages about five per cent; with very muddy waters more is required.\r\nAt Louisville, with the worst waters, the per cents of wash-water rose\r\nat times to 30 per cent of the total quantity of water filtered.\r\n\r\nThe rate of filtration with mechanical filters should be kept as\r\nconstant as possible, and can be regulated by devices similar to\r\nthose described in connection with sand filters. Owing to the smaller\r\nareas and capacities, the amounts of water to be handled in the units\r\nare smaller, and the regulating devices are thus smaller, and have\r\nalways been made of metal, either cast iron or copper. None of the\r\ndevices employed in the above-mentioned experiments has been entirely\r\nsatisfactory in this respect. The devices employed have been too small,\r\nand the water has gone through at too high velocities to allow close\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MECHANICAL FILTERS AT ELMIRA, N. Y. UPPER PLATFORM AND\r\nGENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF FILTERS.\r\n\r\n  [_To face page 178._]\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs between the two types of filters, the Jewell filter requires a large\r\nloss of head. The water has to be pumped at a sufficient elevation\r\nto reach the top of a tank about 18 feet high, while the effluent\r\nmust be drawn off at the extreme bottom. The Warren filter is much\r\nmore economical in head, the plants at Pittsburg and Louisville only\r\nrequiring about 9 feet from the inlet to the outlet.\r\n\r\nThe earlier mechanical filters were usually constructed of wrought\r\niron or steel plates. More recently wooden tanks have been commonly\r\nemployed, although steel is regarded as preferable. Concrete or masonry\r\ntanks have been suggested, but they have not as yet been employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFICIENCY OF MECHANICAL FILTERS.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of mechanical filters depends entirely upon the use of\r\ncoagulants. Without coagulants they can only be used to remove very\r\nlarge particles. The efficiency of the filtration depends much more\r\nupon the kind, and amount, and method of application of coagulant than\r\nupon the arrangement of the filter. In fact, the arrangements of the\r\nfilter are more directed to the convenience and economy of operation\r\nand washing than towards the efficiency of the results.\r\n\r\nThe conditions which control the efficiency of mechanical filters\r\nhave been discussed in connection with coagulation. With sufficient\r\ncoagulant the removal of turbidity or mud is complete. Color also can\r\nbe removed with these filters. The bacterial efficiencies secured with\r\nthem have been discussed at length in connection with the Pittsburg\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nWith careful coagulation and manipulation it is possible to get 98 per\r\ncent bacterial efficiency without difficulty. The results are somewhat\r\nirregular, for reasons not as yet fully understood. On some occasions\r\nhigher bacterial efficiencies are secured with smaller quantities of\r\ncoagulant, while at other times the efficiencies are less without\r\napparent reason. There seems to be a limit to the bacterial efficiency\r\nwhich can be secured with any amount of sulphate of alumina and\r\nrapid filtration, and it is doubtful if a plant could be operated to\r\nregularly secure as high a bacterial efficiency as 99 per cent with any\r\namount of sulphate of alumina.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESSURE FILTERS.\r\n\r\nPressure mechanical filters are constructed in entirely closed\r\nreceptacles, through which the water is forced under pressure and not\r\nby gravity. Many of the earlier mechanical filters were of this type.\r\nIn small plants this system has the distinct advantage that the water\r\ncan be pumped from a river or other source of supply through a filter\r\ndirect to the reservoir or into the mains, while any other system would\r\ninvolve a second pumping. Pressure filters are extensively used for\r\nhotel supplies, etc., where, from the conditions, gravity filters are\r\nimpossible. The practical objections to this system have been found\r\nto be so great that it is rarely used under other conditions. Some\r\nexperiments were made at Louisville with a filter of this type, but\r\nthey were not long continued, and aside from them there is no precise\r\ninformation as to what can be accomplished with filters of this type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nOTHER METHODS OF FILTRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORMS TILE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThis system, invented and patented by Director Fischer of the Worms\r\nwater-works, consists of the filtration of water through artificial\r\nhollow sandstone tiles, made by heating a mixture of broken glass\r\nand sand, sifted to determined sizes, to a point just below the\r\nmelting-point of the glass, in suitable moulds or forms. The glass\r\nsoftens and adheres to the sand, forming a strong porous substance\r\nthrough which water can be passed. These tiles are made hollow and\r\nare immersed in the water to be treated, the effluent being removed\r\nfrom the centre of each tile. They are connected together in groups\r\ncorresponding in size to the units of a sand-filtration plant. They\r\nare washed by a reverse current of filtered water. These tiles have\r\nbeen used for some years at Worms, Germany, and at a number of smaller\r\nplaces, and were investigated experimentally at Pittsburg. Some\r\ndifficulty has been experienced in getting tiles with pores small\r\nenough to yield an effluent of the desired purity, and at the same time\r\nlarge enough to allow a reasonable quantity of water to pass. In fact,\r\nwith other than quite clear waters, it has not been found feasible to\r\naccomplish both objects at the same time, and it has been necessary\r\nto treat the water with coagulants and preliminary sedimentation or\r\nfiltration before applying it to the tiles. The problem of making the\r\njoints between the tiles and the collection-pipes water-tight when\r\nsurrounded by the raw water also is a matter of some difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF ASBESTOS.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested by Mr. P. A. Maignen that the surface of sand\r\nfilters should be covered with a thin layer of asbestos, applied in\r\nthe form of a pulp, with the first water put onto the filter after\r\nscraping. The asbestos forms a sort of a paper on the sand which\r\nintercepts the sediment of the passing water. The advantage of the\r\nprocess is in the cleaning. When dried to the right consistency this\r\nasbestos can be rolled up like a carpet, and taken from the filter\r\nwithout removing any of the sand.\r\n\r\nThis procedure is almost identical with that which has occurred\r\nnaturally in iron-removal plants, where algæ grow in the water upon the\r\nfilters, and form a fibrous substance with the ferric oxide removed\r\nfrom the water, which can be rolled up and removed in the same way\r\nas the asbestos. The advantages of the process, from an economical\r\nstandpoint, are less clear.\r\n\r\n\r\nFILTERS USING HIGH RATES OF FILTRATION WITHOUT COAGULANTS.\r\n\r\nNumerous filters have been suggested, and a few have been constructed\r\nfor the use of much higher rates of filtration than are usually\r\nemployed with sand filters, but without the use of coagulants. The\r\nresults obtained depend upon the requirements and upon the character\r\nof the raw water. If a reservoir water contains an algæ growth, it can\r\noften be removed by a coarse and rapid filter. The organisms in this\r\ncase are many times larger than the bacteria, and many times larger\r\nthan the clay particles which constitute turbidity. The requirements in\r\nthis case are rather in the nature of straining than of filtration.\r\n\r\nThe conditions necessary for the removal of bacteria and turbidity are\r\nvery well understood, and it can be stated with the utmost confidence\r\nthat no system of filtration through sand at rates many times as\r\nhigh as are used in ordinary sand filtration, and without the use of\r\ncoagulants, will be satisfactory where either bacterial efficiency\r\nor clarification is required. The application of such systems of\r\nfiltration would therefore seem to be somewhat limited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REMOVING DIRTY ASBESTOS COVERING FROM AN EXPERIMENTAL\r\nFILTER. MAIGNEN SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n  [_To face page 182._]\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSEHOLD FILTERS.\r\n\r\nThe subject of household filters is a somewhat broad one, as the\r\nvariety in these filters is even greater than in the larger filters,\r\nand the range in the results to be expected from them is at least as\r\ngreat. I shall only attempt to indicate here some of the leading points\r\nin regard to them.\r\n\r\nHousehold filters may be used to remove mud or iron rust from the tap\r\nwater, or to remove the bacteria in case the latter is sewage-polluted,\r\nor to do both at once. Perhaps oftener they are used simply because\r\nit is believed to be the proper thing, and without any clear\r\nconception either of the desired result or the way in which it can\r\nbe accomplished. I shall consider them only in their relations to\r\nthe removal of bacteria, as I credit the people who employ them with\r\nbeing sufficiently good judges of their efficiency in removing visible\r\nsediment.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, as a general rule, which has very few if any\r\nexceptions, we may say that all small filters which allow a good stream\r\nof water to pass do not remove the bacteria. The reason for this is\r\nsimply that a material open enough to allow water to pass through it\r\nrapidly is not fine enough to stop such small bodies as the bacteria.\r\nThe filters which are so often sold as “germ-proof,” consisting of\r\nsand, animal charcoal, wire-cloth, filter-paper, etc., do not afford\r\nprotection against any unhealthy qualities which there may be in the\r\nraw water. Animal charcoal removes color without retaining the far more\r\nobjectionable bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe other household filters have filtering materials of much finer\r\ngrain, unglazed porcelain and natural sandstone being the most\r\nprominent materials, while infusorial earth is also used. The smaller\r\nsizes of these filters allow water to pass only drop by drop, and when\r\na fair stream passes them the filters have considerable filtering\r\narea (as a series of filter-tubes connected together). On account of\r\ntheir slow action, filters of this class are, as a rule, provided with\r\nstorage reservoirs so that filtered water to the capacity of the\r\nreservoir can be drawn rapidly (provided the calls do not come too\r\noften). Some of these filters are nearly germ-proof, and are comparable\r\nin their efficiency to large sand-filters. There is no sharp line\r\nbetween the filters which stop and which do not stop the bacteria; but\r\nin general the rule that a filter which works rapidly in proportion to\r\nits size does not do so, and _vice versa_, will be found correct.\r\n\r\nIn thinking of the efficiency of household filters we must distinguish\r\nbetween the filter carefully prepared for an award at an exhibition\r\nand the filter of the same kind doing its average daily work in the\r\nkitchen. If we could be sure in the latter case that an unbroken layer\r\nof fine sandstone or porcelain was always between ourselves and the raw\r\ntap-water we could feel comparatively safe. The manufacturers of the\r\nfilters claim that leaky joints, cracked tubes, etc., are impossible;\r\nbut I would urge upon the people using water filtered in this way that\r\nthey personally assure themselves that this is actually the case with\r\ntheir own filters, for in case any such accident should happen the\r\nconsequences might be most unpleasant. The increased yield of a filter\r\ndue to a leaky joint is sure not to decrease it in favor with the cook,\r\nwho is probably quite out of patience with it because it works so\r\nslowly, that is, in case it is good for anything.\r\n\r\nThe operation of household filters is necessarily, with rare\r\nexceptions, left to the kitchen-girl and luck. Scientific supervision\r\nis practically impossible. With a large filter, on the other hand,\r\nconcentrating all the filters for the city at a single point, a\r\ncompetent man can be employed to run them in the best-known way; and\r\nif desired, and as is actually done in very many places, an entirely\r\nindependent bacteriologist can be employed to determine the efficiency\r\nof filtration. With the methods of examination now available, and\r\na little care in selecting the times and places of collecting the\r\nsamples, it is quite impossible for a filter-superintendent to\r\ndeliver a poor effluent very often or for any considerable length of\r\ntime without being caught. The safety of properly-conducted central\r\nfiltration is thus infinitely greater than that from even the best\r\nhousehold filters. Further, it may be doubted whether an infected water\r\ncan be sent into every house in the city to be used for washing and all\r\nthe purposes to which water is put except drinking, without causing\r\ndisease, although less than it would if it were also used for drinking.\r\n\r\nThe use of household filters must be regarded as a somewhat desperate\r\nmethod of avoiding some of the bad consequences of a polluted\r\nwater-supply, and they are adopted for the most part by citizens who\r\nin some measure realize the dangers from bad water, but who cannot\r\npersuade their fellow-citizens to a more thorough and adequate solution\r\nof the problem. Such citizens, by the use of the best filters, and by\r\ncarefully watching their action, or by having their drinking-water\r\nboiled, can avoid the principal dangers from bad water, but their\r\nvigilance does not protect their more careless neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF IRON FROM GROUND-WATERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe filtration of ground-waters is a comparatively recent development.\r\nGround-waters are filtered by their passage through soil generally\r\nmuch more perfectly than it is possible to filter other waters, and\r\nany further filtration of them is useless. Such waters, however,\r\noccasionally contain iron in solution as ferrous carbonate.\r\n\r\nWaters containing iron have been used as mineral waters for a very long\r\ntime. Such waters have an astringent taste, and have been esteemed\r\nfor some purposes. As ordinary water-supplies, however, they are\r\nobjectionable. The iron deposits in the pipes when the current is\r\nslow, and is flushed out when it is rapid, and makes the water turbid\r\nand disagreeable; and still worse, the iron often gets through the\r\npipe-system in solution, and deposits in the wash-tub, coloring the\r\nlinen a rusty brown and quite spoiling it.\r\n\r\nAn organism called crenothrix grows in pipes carrying waters containing\r\niron, and after a while this organism dies, and decomposes, and\r\ngives rise to very disagreeable tastes and odors. It thus happens\r\nthat ground-waters containing iron are unsatisfactory as public\r\nwater-supplies, and are sources of serious complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMOUNT OF IRON REQUIRED TO RENDER WATER OBJECTIONABLE.\r\n\r\nThree hundredths of a part in 100,000 of metallic iron very rarely\r\nprecipitate or cause any trouble. Five hundredths occasionally\r\nprecipitate, and this amount may be taken as about the allowable\r\nlimit of iron in a satisfactory water. One tenth of a part is quite\r\nsure to precipitate and give rise to serious complaint. Two or three\r\ntenths make the water entirely unsuitable for laundry purposes, and\r\nare otherwise seriously objectionable, and will hardly be tolerated\r\nby a community. Under some conditions ground-waters carry as much\r\nas 1 part in 100,000 of iron, and such waters are hardly usable. In\r\niron-removal plants an effluent containing less than 0.05 is regarded\r\nas satisfactory. One containing less than 0.02, as is the case with\r\nmany plants, is all that can be desired. The percentage of removal is\r\nof no significance, but only the amount left in the effluent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF IRON IN GROUND-WATERS.\r\n\r\nNatural sands, gravels, and rocks almost always contain iron, often in\r\nconsiderable amount. The iron is usually combined with oxygen as ferric\r\noxide, and in this condition it is insoluble in water. Water passing\r\nthrough iron containing materials will not ordinarily take up iron.\r\nWhen, however, the water contains a large amount of organic matter in\r\nsolution, this organic matter takes part of the oxygen away from the\r\niron, and reduces the ferric oxide to ferrous oxide. The ferrous oxide\r\ncombines with carbonic acid, always present under these conditions,\r\nforming ferrous carbonate, which is soluble and which goes into\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nSurface-waters nearly always carry free oxygen, and when such waters\r\nenter the ground they carry oxygen with them, and the organic matters\r\nin the water use up the free oxygen before they commence to take oxygen\r\naway from the iron of the ground. It is thus only in the presence of\r\norganic matters, and in the absence of free oxygen, that the solution\r\nof iron is possible. It sometimes happens that the organic matters\r\nwhich reduce the iron are contained in the soil itself, in which\r\ncase iron may be taken up even by water originally very pure, as for\r\ninstance, by rain-water.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, iron is everywhere present in sufficient quantity\r\nin the strata from which ground-waters are obtained, and wherever the\r\nconditions of the organic matters and oxygen necessary for solution\r\noccur, iron-containing waters are secured, and the iron is usually\r\npresent in the earth in such quantity that the water can dissolve as\r\nmuch as it will take up for a long series of years, or for centuries,\r\nwithout exhausting the supply. There is thus little prospect of\r\nimprovement of such waters from exhaustion of the supply of iron.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which control the solution of iron are very\r\ncomplicated and difficult to determine. Wells near a river, and drawing\r\ntheir water largely from it by seepage, are apt to yield a water\r\ncontaining iron sooner or later, especially where the river-water\r\ncarries a large amount of organic matter in solution. Waters drawn from\r\nextensive gravel deposits, in which the water is renewed principally by\r\nthe rainfall upon the surface of the deposits themselves, often remain\r\nentirely free from iron indefinitely. The rain-water is almost free\r\nfrom organic matter, and the air is able to take care of decomposing\r\norganic matters in the surface soil, and below this there are no\r\naccumulations of organic matter sufficient to cause the solution of\r\niron. Under other conditions there are subterranean sources of organic\r\nmatter which result in the solution of iron under conditions which, on\r\nthe surface, appear most favorable for securing good water. Wells are\r\noften used for many years without developing iron, when suddenly iron\r\nwill appear. This appearance of iron is often connected with increasing\r\nconsumption of water. In some cases it may result from drawing water\r\nfrom areas not previously drawn upon.\r\n\r\nWhen iron once makes its appearance in a water, it seldom disappears\r\ncompletely afterward, although it often fluctuates widely at different\r\nseasons of the year and under different conditions of pumping. In some\r\ncases a decrease in the quantity of iron is noted after a number of\r\nyears, but in other cases this does not happen.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases manganese has been found in ground-waters. Manganese in\r\nwater behaves much like iron, but there are some points of difference,\r\nso that the possibility of the presence of this substance should be\r\nborne in mind.\r\n\r\nIron-containing waters are generally entirely free from oxygen, and\r\nwhen first drawn from the ground they are bright and clear and do not\r\ndiffer in appearance from other ground-waters. On exposure to the air\r\nthey quickly become turbid from the oxidation of the iron, and its\r\nprecipitation as ferric hydrate. At West Superior, Wisconsin, a water\r\nwas found containing both iron and dissolved oxygen. It was turbid\r\nas pumped from the well. This condition of affairs seemed abnormal,\r\nbut was repeatedly checked, and the theory was advanced by Mr. R. S.\r\nWeston, who made the observations, that it resulted from a mixture in\r\nthe wells of two entirely different waters, namely, a water resulting\r\nfrom the rainfall on sand deposits back of the wells, containing\r\ndissolved oxygen and no iron, and water from the lake which had seeped\r\nthrough the sand, and which contained a considerable amount of iron\r\nin solution but no dissolved oxygen. The wells thus drew water from\r\nopposite directions, and the two waters were entirely different in\r\ncharacter, and the mixture thus had a composition which would not have\r\nbeen possible in a water all of which came from a single source.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF IRON-CONTAINING WATERS.\r\n\r\nThe removal of iron from ground-water is ordinarily a very simple\r\nprocedure. It is simply necessary to aerate the water, by which process\r\nthe ferrous carbonate is decomposed, and oxidized with the formation\r\nof ferric hydrate, which forms a flocculent precipitate and is readily\r\nremoved by filtration. The aeration required varies in different cases.\r\nThe quantity of oxygen required to oxidize the iron is only a small\r\nfraction of the amount which water will dissolve, and allowing water to\r\nsimply fall through the air for a few feet in fine streams will usually\r\nsupply several times as much oxygen as is necessary for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAerating devices of this kind have proved sufficient in a number of\r\ncases, as at Far Rockaway, L. I., and at Red Bank, N. J. In some cases,\r\nhowever, a further aeration is necessary, not for the purpose of\r\ngetting more oxygen into the water, but to get the excess of carbonic\r\nacid out of it. Carbonic acid seems to retard in some way the oxidation\r\nof the iron, and it is occasionally present in ground-waters in\r\nconsiderable quantity, and quite seriously interferes with the process.\r\nIt can be removed sufficiently by aeration, but the necessary amount of\r\nexposure to air is much greater than that required to simply introduce\r\noxygen.\r\n\r\nCoke-towers have sometimes been used for this purpose. The towers are\r\nfilled with coarse coke and have open sides, and water is sprinkled\r\nover the tops of them and allowed to drip through to the bottoms. In\r\ngeneral the simple exposure of water to the air for a sufficient length\r\nof time, in any form of apparatus or simply in open channels, will\r\naccomplish the desired results.\r\n\r\nMr. H. W. Clark[45] has called attention to the fact that in some cases\r\ncoke seems to have a direct chemical action upon the water which is\r\nentirely independent of its aerating effect. In his experiments there\r\nseemed to be some property in the coke which caused the iron to oxidize\r\nand flocculate in many cases when it refused to do so with simple\r\naeration and filtration.\r\n\r\nWhen the right conditions are reached the oxidation of the iron is\r\nvery rapid, and it separates out in flakes of such size that they can\r\nbe removed by filtration at almost any practicable rate. Mechanical\r\nfilters have been used for this purpose, with rates of filtration\r\nof 100 million gallons per acre daily. In Germany, where plants for\r\nthe removal of iron are quite common, modified forms of sand filters\r\nhave usually been employed which have been operated at rates up to 25\r\nmillion gallons per acre daily.\r\n\r\nIn experiments made by the Massachusetts State Board of Health rates\r\nfrom 10 to 25 million gallons per acre daily have been employed.\r\n\r\nThe sand used for filtration may appropriately be somewhat coarser than\r\nwould be used for treating surface-waters, and the thickness of the\r\nsand layer may be reduced. Owing to the higher\r\n\r\nrates the underdrainage system must be more ample than is otherwise\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe rate of filtration employed is usually not a matter of vital\r\nimportance, but by selecting a rate that is not too high it is possible\r\nto use a moderate loss of head. It is thus not necessary to clean the\r\nfilters too often, and the expenses of operation are not as high as\r\nwith an extreme rate. In some cases it is desired to accomplish other\r\nresults than the removal of iron by filtration, and this may lead to\r\nthe selection of a rate lower than would otherwise be used.\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions of operation all of the iron separates on the\r\ntop of the sand. No appreciable amount of it penetrates the sand at\r\nall. With open filters at Far Rockaway and at Red Bank there is an algæ\r\ngrowth in the water upon the filters which, with the iron, forms a\r\nmat upon the surface of the filter; and when the filter is put out of\r\nservice and allowed to partially dry, this mat can be rolled up like a\r\ncarpet and thrown off without removing any sand, and the filters have\r\nbeen in use for several years without renewing any sand and without any\r\nimportant decrease in the thickness of the sand layer.\r\n\r\nSome waters contain iron in such a form that it cannot be successfully\r\nremoved in this manner. Thus at Reading, Mass., it was reported by\r\nDr. Thomas M. Drown that the iron was present in the form of ferrous\r\nsulphate instead of ferrous carbonate, and that it was not capable of\r\nbeing separated by simple aeration and filtration. A Warren mechanical\r\nfilter was installed, and the water is treated by aeration and with\r\nthe addition of lime and alum. The cost of the process is thereby much\r\nincreased, and the hardness of the water is increased threefold.\r\n\r\nSeveral other cases have been reported where it was believed that\r\nsimple aeration and filtration were inadequate; but the advantages of\r\nthe simple procedure are so great as to make it worth a very careful\r\nstudy to determine if more complete aeration, or the use of coke-towers\r\nand perhaps slower filtration, would not serve in these cases without\r\nresorting to the use of chemicals and their attendant disadvantages.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRON-REMOVAL PLANTS IN OPERATION.\r\n\r\nIron-removal plants are now in use at Amsterdam and The Hague in\r\nHolland, at Copenhagen in Denmark, at Kiel, Charlottenburg, Leipzig,\r\nHalle, and many other places in Germany; at Reading, Mass.; Far\r\nRockaway, L. I.; Red Bank, Asbury Park, Atlantic Highlands, and\r\nKeyport, N. J.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest plants for the removal of iron were the filters\r\nconstructed at Amsterdam and The Hague in Holland. At Amsterdam the\r\nwater is derived from open canals in the dunes draining a large area.\r\nThe water has its origin in the rain-water falling upon the sand. The\r\nsand is very fine and contains organic matter in sufficient amount\r\nso that the ground-water is impregnated with iron. In flowing to a\r\ncentral point in the open canals the water becomes aerated and the iron\r\noxidized. There are also algæ growths in the water which perhaps aid\r\nthe process. Sand filters of ordinary construction are used, and remove\r\nboth the iron and the algæ, and the rate of filtration is not higher\r\nthan is usually used in the treatment of river-waters, although it\r\ncould probably be largely increased without detriment to the supply.\r\n\r\nThe works at The Hague are very similar to those at Amsterdam, but\r\ncovered collectors are used to supplement the open canals. Both\r\nof these plants were built before much was known about iron in\r\nground-waters and the means for its removal, but they have performed\r\ntheir work with uniformly satisfactory results. In the more recent\r\nGerman works various aerating devices are employed, and filters similar\r\nin general construction to ordinary sand filters, but with larger\r\nconnections suited to very high rates of filtration, are employed.\r\n\r\nThe plant at Asbury Park was the first of importance constructed in\r\nAmerica. The water is raised from wells from 400 to 1100 feet deep\r\nby compressed air by a Pohle lift. It is delivered into a square\r\nmasonry receiving-basin holding some hours’ supply. The aeration of\r\nthe water by this means is very complete. It is afterwards pumped\r\nthrough Continental pressure filters direct into the service-pipes. The\r\nreservoir for the aerated water was not a part of the original plant,\r\nbut was added afterwards to facilitate operation, and to give more\r\ncomplete aeration before filtration.\r\n\r\nAt Far Rockaway, L. I., the water is lifted from wells by a Worthington\r\nPump, and is discharged over the bell of a vertical 16-inch pipe,\r\nfrom which it falls through the air to the water in a receiving\r\nchamber around it. The simple fall through the air aerates the water\r\nsufficiently. From the receiving-chamber the water is taken to either\r\nor both of two filters, each with an area of 20,000 square feet. These\r\nfilters are open, with brick walls and concrete bottoms, three feet\r\nof sand and one foot of gravel, and the underdrains are of the usual\r\ntype. The water flows through regulator-chambers to a well 25 feet in\r\ndiameter and 12 feet deep, from which it is pumped to a stand-pipe in\r\nthe town. The plant was built to treat easily three million gallons\r\nper day, and has occasionally treated a larger quantity. Either filter\r\nyields the whole supply while the other is being cleaned. The rate of\r\nfiltration in this case was made lower than would have otherwise been\r\nnecessary, as there was an alternate supply, namely, the water from\r\ntwo brooks, which could be used on occasions, and to purify which a\r\nlower rate of filtration was regarded necessary, than would have been\r\nrequired for the well-water. The removal of iron is complete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.]\r\n\r\nThe plant of the Rumson Improvement Company at Red Bank, N. J., is\r\nquite similar to that at Far Rockaway, but is much smaller. The outlet\r\nis a 6-inch pipe perforated with 1/4-inch holes which throws the water\r\nout in a pine-tree shape to the receiving-tank, thoroughly aerating\r\nit. Each of the two filters has 770 square feet of area. The filtering\r\nmaterial is three feet of beach sand. From the regulator-chamber the\r\nwater flows to a circular well 18 feet in diameter, covered by a brick\r\ndome and holding 17,000 gallons, from which it is pumped to the\r\nstand-pipe. Either of the filters will treat ten thousand gallons of\r\nwater per hour, which is equal to the capacity of the pumps; and as\r\nthe consumption is considerably less than this figure, they are only\r\nin use for a part of each day, the number of hours depending upon the\r\nconsumption. These filters are shown by the accompanying plan. The cost\r\nof the work was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Filters and pure-water reservoir, with piping\r\n    and drains complete                         $3,799.47\r\n  New pump and connections                         492.68\r\n  Engineering and superintendence                  992.91\r\n                                                ---------\r\n        Total cost of plant                     $5,285.06\r\n\r\nThe engineer who operates the pumps takes care of the filters, and no\r\nadditional labor has been required. The entire cost of operation is\r\nthus represented by the additional coal required for the preliminary\r\nlift from the wells to the filters. The effluent is always free from\r\niron.\r\n\r\nThe plant at Reading,[46] Mass., was installed by the Cumberland\r\nManufacturing Company, and combines aeration, treatment with lime and\r\nsulphate of alumina and rapid filtration. The aeration is effected\r\nby pumping air through the water, after the water has received the\r\nlime. It afterwards receives sulphate of alumina and passes to a\r\nsettling-tank holding 40,000 gallons, in which the water remains for\r\nabout an hour. There are six filters of the Warren type, each with an\r\neffective filtering area of 54 square feet.\r\n\r\nThe cost of coagulant is considerable. The chief disadvantage of the\r\nprocess is that it hardens the water, which is naturally soft. From\r\nthe completion of the plant in July, 1896, to the end of the year the\r\nhardness of the water was increased, according to analyses of the State\r\nBoard of Health, from 4.1 to 11.3 parts in 100,000, and for the year\r\n1897 the increase was from 4.0 to 12.7. The iron, which is present in\r\nthe raw water to the extent of about 0.26 part in 100,000, is removed\r\nsufficiently at all times.\r\n\r\nPrior to the erection of this plant Mr. Desmond FitzGerald advised\r\naeration followed by sedimentation in two reservoirs holding half a\r\nmillion gallons each, and by rapid filtration. Mr. Bancroft states that\r\nin his opinion, if the reservoir recommended by Mr. FitzGerald had been\r\nbuilt, the filters could be run with very little or no coagulation, and\r\nconsequently without increase in hardness, which is the most obvious\r\ndisadvantage to the procedure. The nominal capacity of the plant is\r\none million gallons, and the average consumption about 200,000 gallons\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nThe plant at Keyport, N. J., is similar, but smaller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF WATERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now reviewed the most important methods in use for the treatment\r\nof waters, we may take a general view of their application to various\r\nclasses of waters. Different raw waters vary so much, and the\r\nrequirements of filtration are so different, that it is not possible\r\nto outline any general procedure or combination of procedures, but\r\neach problem must be taken up by itself. Nevertheless, some general\r\nsuggestions may be of service.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we may consider the case of waters containing very\r\nlarge quantities of oxidizable organic matter. Such waters are obtained\r\nfrom some reservoirs containing very active vegetable and animal\r\ngrowths, or from rivers receiving large amounts of sewage. Waters\r\nof both of these classes are, if possible, to be avoided for public\r\nwater-supplies. When circumstances require their use, they can best be\r\ntreated by intermittent filtration, this process being best adapted to\r\nthe destruction by oxygen of excessive quantities of organic matter.\r\n\r\nWhere the pollution is less, so that the dissolved oxygen contained\r\nin the raw water is sufficient for the oxidation of the organic\r\nmatters, continuous filtration will give substantially as good results\r\nas intermittent filtration, and in other respects it has important\r\nadvantages. The application of intermittent filtration for the\r\ntreatment of public water-supplies is thus somewhat limited, and, as a\r\nmatter of fact, it has been used in only a few cases.\r\n\r\nFor the treatment of very highly polluted waters double filtration has\r\nbeen used in a number of cases, notably by the Grand Junction Company\r\nat London, at Schiedam in Holland, and at Bremen and Altona in Germany.\r\nAt the two first-mentioned places two separate systems of filters are\r\nprovided differing somewhat in construction, the first filters being at\r\na higher level than the after filters. The first filters supply water\r\nof comparative purity, and very constant composition, to the after\r\nfilters, which are able to treat it with great efficiency and at very\r\nlow operating cost.\r\n\r\nThis procedure is probably the most perfect which has been used for the\r\nremoval of disease-producing qualities from highly polluted waters; and\r\nthe cost of the process may not be as much greater than that of simple\r\nfiltration as would at first appear, because the cost of cleaning the\r\nafter filters is merely nominal, and the attendance, pumping, etc.,\r\nare practically common to both sets of filters, and are not materially\r\ngreater than they would be for a single set.\r\n\r\nFor very bad waters the first filters might appropriately be\r\nintermittent, while the after filters should be continuous. This was\r\nthe procedure originally intended for Lawrence, but the intermittent\r\nfilter first constructed yielded such very good results that it has not\r\nbeen considered necessary to complete the plant as originally projected.\r\n\r\nAt Bremen and at Altona a different procedure has been adopted. The\r\nfilters are all upon the same level, and of the same construction.\r\nWhen a filter is put in service the effluent from it, instead of being\r\ntaken to the pure-water reservoir, is taken to another filter which\r\nhas already been some time in service. After the first filter has been\r\nin operation for some time its effluent is taken to the pure-water\r\nreservoir, and in turn it is supplied with the effluent from a filter\r\nmore recently cleaned. The loss of head of water passing a freshly\r\ncleaned filter is comparatively slight, and the water of the second\r\nfilter is allowed to fall a few inches below the high-water mark,\r\nat which level it will take the effluent from the other filter. The\r\nconnections between the filters are made by siphons of large pipe, the\r\nsummits of which are considerably above the high-water line. These\r\nsiphons are filled by exhausting the air, and when opened to the air\r\nthere is no possibility of a flow of water through them. The process\r\nhas given extremely good results in practice, yielding effluents of the\r\nvery greatest purity and at a quite moderate cost of operation.\r\n\r\nAn objection to the method is the possible filling of a siphon some\r\ntime when the water standing upon the after-filter is higher than that\r\nin the pure-water well of the fore-filter, and while the fore-filter is\r\nconnected with the pure-water reservoir. Such a connection would send\r\nunfiltered water into the pure-water reservoir direct. I do not know\r\nthat any trouble of this kind has ever been experienced at Bremen or at\r\nAltona; and the objection to this system is perhaps not well founded\r\nwhere the management is careful and conscientious. The fact that an\r\nunscrupulous attendant can make the connection at any time to help out\r\na deficiency of supply, or simply through carelessness, is certainly\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\nFor the treatment of river-waters and lake-waters containing only\r\na small quantity of sediment, and where the removal of bacteria or\r\ndisease-producing qualities is the most important object of filtration,\r\nsand filters can be used. Where the rivers are subject to floods and\r\nmoderate amounts of muddy water, sedimentation-basins or storage\r\nreservoirs for raw water will often be found advantageous.\r\n\r\nFor the treatment of extremely muddy waters, and waters which are\r\ncontinuously muddy for long periods of time, and for the removal\r\nof color from very highly colored waters, resource must be had to\r\ncoagulants. The coagulants which are necessary in each special case and\r\nwhich can be used without injury to the water must be determined by\r\nmost careful investigation of the raw water.\r\n\r\nFor the filtration of these waters after coagulation either sand or\r\nmechanical filters can be employed. As the principal work in this\r\ncase is done by the coagulant, the kind of filtration employed is\r\nof less consequence than where filtration alone is relied upon,\r\nand the cheapest form of filter will naturally be employed. Under\r\npresent conditions mechanical filters will usually be cheaper than\r\nsand filters for use in this way; but where waters, in addition to the\r\nmud, carry bacteria in such large numbers as to make high bacterial\r\nefficiency a matter of importance, sand filters may be selected, as the\r\nbacterial efficiency obtained with them is not dependent upon the use\r\nof coagulant; and is therefore less subject to interruptions from the\r\nfailure to apply coagulant in the right proportion.\r\n\r\nMechanical filters have also been used for the treatment of\r\ncomparatively clear waters where bacterial efficiency was the principal\r\nobject of filtration. For this purpose the efficiencies obtained with\r\nthem are usually inferior to those obtained with sand filters, while\r\nthe cost of coagulants is so great as to make their use often more\r\nexpensive than that of sand filters.\r\n\r\nIn the case of many streams which are comparatively clear for a part of\r\nthe year, but occasionally are quite turbid, the use of sand filters\r\nhas this advantage, that the use of coagulants can be stopped and the\r\ncost of operation reduced whenever the water is clear enough to allow\r\nof satisfactory treatment by them; and that coagulant can be employed\r\non those days when otherwise insufficient clarification would be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIn this case the high bacterial efficiency is secured at all times,\r\nwhile the cost of coagulant is saved during the greater part of the\r\ntime. In such cases, also, the preliminary process of sedimentation and\r\nstorage should be developed as far as possible.\r\n\r\nThe application of other processes of filtration to special problems\r\nare not sufficiently well understood to allow general discussion, and\r\nmust be taken up separately with reference to the requirements of each\r\nspecial situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST OF FILTRATION.\r\n\r\nThe cost of filtration of water depends upon the character of the raw\r\nwater, upon the nature of the plant employed, upon its size, and\r\nupon the skill and economy of manipulation. These conditions affect\r\nthe cost to such an extent as to make any accurate general estimate\r\nquite impossible. Nevertheless a little consideration of the subject,\r\nalthough not leading to exact results, may be helpful as furnishing a\r\nrough idea of the probable cost before estimates for local conditions\r\nare made.\r\n\r\nOpen sand filters, with masonry walls, with reasonably favorable\r\nconditions of construction, and not too small in area, have averaged\r\nto cost in the United States within the last few years perhaps about\r\nthirty thousand dollars per acre. The relative cost of small plants is\r\nsomewhat greater, and with embankments instead of masonry walls, the\r\ncost is somewhat reduced. The cost is less where natural deposits of\r\nsand can be made use of practically in their original condition, and is\r\nincreased where the filtering materials have to be transported by rail\r\nfor long distances, or where the sites are difficult to build upon.\r\nCovered filters cost about a half more than open filters. Mechanical\r\nfilters at current prices cost about $20 per square foot of filtering\r\narea, to which must be added the cost of foundations and buildings,\r\nwhich perhaps average to cost half as much more, but are dependent upon\r\nlocal conditions and the character of the buildings.\r\n\r\nTo these figures must be added the costs of pumps, reservoirs,\r\nsedimentation-basins, and pipe-connections, which are often greater\r\nthan the costs of the filters, but which differ so widely in different\r\ncases as to make any general estimate impossible.\r\n\r\nFilters must be provided sufficient to meet the maximum and not the\r\naverage consumption. The excess of maximum over average requirements\r\nvaries greatly in different cities, and depends largely upon reservoir\r\ncapacities and arrangements.\r\n\r\nAs a result of a considerable number of estimates made by the author\r\nfor average American conditions, the cost of installing filters may\r\nbe taken very roughly as five dollars per inhabitant, but the amounts\r\ndiffer widely in various cases.\r\n\r\nThe cost of operation of sand filters in England probably averages\r\nabout one dollar per million gallons of water filtered. The following\r\ntable shows the costs of operation of the filters of the seven London\r\ncompanies for fifteen years, compiled in the office of Mr. W. B. Bryan,\r\nChief Engineer of the East London Water Company. The results have been\r\ncomputed to dollars per million U.

Wages average\r\n  about $1.00 per day. At Liverpool for 1896 the cost was $1.08 per\r\n  million U. S. gallons.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, with more turbid river-waters, the costs of operation are\r\nsomewhat higher than the London figures, while at Zürich, where the\r\nwater is very clear, they are lower.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the data regarding the cost of operation of sand\r\nfilters are less complete. At Mt. Vernon, N. Y., with reservoir-water,\r\nthe cost has averaged about two dollars per million gallons. At\r\nPoughkeepsie, N. Y., with the Hudson River water, which is occasionally\r\nmoderately turbid, the cost for twenty years has averaged three dollars\r\nper million gallons. This cost includes the cost of handling ice, and\r\nas the average winter temperature is considerably below that suggested\r\nfor open filters, the expense of this work has been considerable, and\r\nhas increased considerably the total cost of operation.\r\n\r\nAt Far Rockaway, L. I., and Red Bank N. J., for iron-removal plants,\r\nthe cost of operation has hardly been appreciable. The plants are both\r\nclose to the pumping-stations, and it has been possible to operate\r\nthem with the labor necessarily engaged at the pumping-station without\r\nadditional cost, except a very small amount of labor on the sand at Far\r\nRockaway. No computation has been made in these cases of the additional\r\ncoal required for pumping.\r\n\r\nAt Lawrence, Mass., the cost of operation for 1895 was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Cost of scraping and replacing sand         $3,467\r\n  Cost of care of ice                          2,903\r\n                                              ------\r\n    Total cost of operation                   $6,370\r\n      Water filtered, millions of gallons  1,097\r\n      Cost per million gallons             $5.80\r\n\r\nThe cost of care of ice has been excessive at Lawrence, and it has\r\nbeen repeatedly recommended to cover the filter to avoid this expense.\r\nThe cost of handling sand has been very greatly increased, because the\r\nfilter is built in one bed, and all work upon it has to be done during\r\nthe comparatively short intervals when the filter is not in use, an\r\narrangement which is not at all economical in the use of labor. The\r\ncost of operation is thus much higher than it would be had the plant\r\nbeen constructed in several units, each of which could be disconnected\r\nfor the purpose of being cleaned in the ordinary manner. As against\r\nthis the first cost of construction was extremely low, and the saving\r\nin interest charges should be credited against the increased cost of\r\nlabor in cleaning.\r\n\r\nThe cost of operating filters at Ashland, Wis., has been estimated by\r\nMr. William Wheeler at $2.26 per million gallons. This estimate is\r\nbased upon the performance for the first year that they were in service.\r\n\r\nIn the operation of mechanical filters one of the largest items of\r\nexpense is for the coagulant, and the amount of this depends entirely\r\nupon the character of the raw water and the thoroughness of the\r\ntreatment required. The data regarding the other or general costs of\r\noperation of mechanical filters are few and unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nI recently made some estimates of cost of clarifying waters of various\r\ndegrees of turbidity by sand and mechanical filters. These estimates\r\nwere made for a special set of conditions, and I do not know that\r\nthey will fit others, but they have at least a suggestive value. The\r\nresults shown by Fig. 26 include only the cost of operation, and not\r\ninterest and depreciation charges. These figures, when used for plants\r\nin connection with which preliminary treatments are used, should be\r\napplied to the turbidity of the water as applied to the filters, and\r\nnot to the raw water, and the costs of the preliminary processes should\r\nbe added.\r\n\r\nWith sand filters the frequency of scraping is nearly proportional\r\nto the turbidity; and as scraping represents most of the expenses,\r\nthe costs of operation are proportional to the turbidity, except\r\nthe general costs, and the cost of the amount of scraping, which is\r\nnecessary with even the clearest waters.\r\n\r\nWith mechanical filters the amount of sulphate of alumina required for\r\nclarification increases with the turbidity, and most of the costs of\r\noperation increase in the same ratio. The diagram shows the amount of\r\nsulphate of alumina in grains per gallon necessary for clarification\r\nwith different degrees of turbidity.\r\n\r\nWith the clearest waters the costs of operation on the two systems are\r\nsubstantially equal. With muddy waters, the expense of operating sand\r\nfilters increases more rapidly than the expense of operating mechanical\r\nfilters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURBIDITY\r\nFIG. 26.—COST OF OPERATION OF FILTERS.]\r\n\r\nThere is another element which often comes into the comparison, namely,\r\nthe question of purification from the effects of sewage-pollution.\r\nNearly all rivers used for public water-supplies receive more or less\r\nsewage, and in filtering such waters it is regarded as necessary to\r\nremove as completely as possible the bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe quantities of sulphate of alumina required for the clarification\r\nof the least turbid waters are not sufficient to give even tolerably\r\ngood bacterial efficiencies. To secure a reasonably complete removal of\r\nbacteria with mechanical filters, the use of a considerable quantity\r\nof sulphate of alumina is required. Let us assume that 98 per cent\r\nbacterial efficiency is required, and that to produce this efficiency\r\nit is necessary to use one grain of coagulant to the gallon. With water\r\nrequiring less than this quantity of coagulant for clarification this\r\nquantity must nevertheless be used, and the costs will be controlled\r\nby it, and not by the lower quantities which would suffice for\r\nclarification, but would not give the required bacterial efficiency.\r\n\r\nI have added this line to the diagram, and this, combined with the\r\nupper portion of the line showing cost of clarification, represents the\r\ncost of treating waters with mechanical filters, where both bacterial\r\nefficiency and clarification are required.\r\n\r\nThis line, considered as a whole, increases much less rapidly with\r\nincreasing turbidity than does the corresponding line for sand filters,\r\nand the two lines cross each other. With the clearest waters sand\r\nfilters are cheaper than mechanical filters, and for the muddiest\r\nwaters they are more expensive. It does not appear from the diagram,\r\nbut it is also true in each case, that the cheaper system is also the\r\nmore efficient. Sand filters are more efficient in removing bacteria\r\nfrom clear waters than are mechanical filters, and mechanical filters\r\nare more efficient in clarifying very muddy waters than are sand\r\nfilters.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WATERS REQUIRE FILTRATION?\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of the case a satisfactory general answer to this\r\nquestion cannot be given, but a few suggestions may be useful.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, ground-waters obviously do not require filtration:\r\nthey have already in most cases been thoroughly filtered in the ground\r\nthrough which they have passed, and in the exceptional cases, as, for\r\ninstance, an artesian well drawing water through fissures in a ledge\r\nfrom a polluted origin, a new supply will generally be chosen rather\r\nthan to attempt to improve so doubtful a raw material.\r\n\r\nRiver-waters should be filtered. It cannot be asserted that there\r\nare no rivers in mountainous districts in which the water is at once\r\nclear and free from pollution, and suitable in its natural state\r\nfor water-supply; but if so, they are not common, least of all in\r\nthe regions where water-supplies are usually required. The use of\r\nriver-waters in their natural state or after sedimentation only,\r\ndrawn from such rivers as the Merrimac, Hudson, Potomac, Delaware,\r\nSchuylkill, Ohio, and Mississippi, is a filthy as well as an unhealthy\r\npractice, which ought to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe question is more difficult in the case of supplies drawn from\r\nlakes or storage reservoirs. Many such supplies are grossly polluted\r\nand should be either abandoned or filtered. Others are subject to algæ\r\ngrowths, or are muddy, and would be much improved by filtration. Still\r\nothers are drawn either from unpolluted water-sheds, or the pollution\r\nis so greatly diluted and reduced by storage that no known disadvantage\r\nresults from their use.\r\n\r\nIn measuring the effects of the pollution of water-supplies, the\r\ntyphoid-fever death-rate is a most important aid. Not that typhoid\r\nfever is the sole evil resulting from polluted water, but because it\r\nis also a very useful index of other evils for which corresponding\r\nstatistics cannot be obtained, as, for instance, the causation of\r\ndiarrhœal diseases or the danger from invasion by cholera.\r\n\r\nI think we shall not go far wrong at the start to confine our attention\r\nto those cities where there are over 25 deaths from typhoid fever per\r\n100,000 of population. This will at once throw out of consideration\r\na large number of relatively good supplies, including those of New\r\nYork and Brooklyn. It is not my idea that none of these supplies\r\ncause disease. Many of them, as for instance that of New York, are\r\nknown to receive sewage, and it is an interesting question worthy of\r\nmost careful study whether there are cases of sickness resulting from\r\nthis pollution. The point that I wish to make now is simply that in\r\nthose cases the death-rate itself is evidence that, with existing\r\nconditions of dilution and storage, the resulting damage of which we\r\nhave knowledge is not great enough to justify the expense involved by\r\nfiltration.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it should not be forgotten that, especially with\r\nvery small watersheds, there may be a danger as distinct from present\r\ndamage which requires consideration. Thus a single house or groups of\r\nhouses draining into a supply may not appreciably affect it for years,\r\nuntil an outbreak of fever on the water-shed results in infecting the\r\nwater with the germs of disease and in an epidemic in the city below.\r\nThis danger decreases with increasing size of the water-shed and volume\r\nof the water with which any such pollution would be mixed, and also\r\nwith the population draining into the water, as there is a probability\r\nthat the amount of infection continually added from a considerable town\r\nwill not be subject to as violent fluctuation as that from only a few\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nThus in Plymouth, Pa., in 1885, there were 1104 cases of typhoid\r\nfever and 114 deaths among a population of 8000, as the result of the\r\ndischarge of the dejecta from a single typhoid patient into the water\r\nof a relatively small impounding reservoir. The cost of this epidemic\r\nwas calculated with unusual care. The care of the sick cost in cash\r\n$67,100.17, and the loss of wages for those who recovered amounted to\r\n$30,020.08. The 114 persons who died were earning before their sickness\r\nat the rate of $18,419.52 annually.\r\n\r\nSuch an outbreak would hardly be possible with the Croton water-shed\r\nof the New York water-supply, on account of the great dilution and\r\ndelay in the reservoirs, but it must be guarded against in small\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nOf the cities having more than 25 deaths per 100,000 from typhoid\r\nfever, some will no doubt be found where milk epidemics or other\r\nspecial circumstances were the cause; but I believe in a majority\r\nof them, and in nearly all cases where the rate is year after year\r\nconsiderably above that figure, the cause will be found in the\r\nwater-supply. Investigation should be made of this point; and if the\r\nwater is not at fault, the responsibility should be located. If the\r\nwater is guilty, it should be either purified or a new supply obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nWATER-SUPPLY AND DISEASE—CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most characteristic and uniform results of the direct\r\npollution of public water-supplies is the typhoid fever which results\r\namong the users of the water. In the English and German cities with\r\nalmost uniformly good drinking-water, typhoid fever is already nearly\r\nexterminated, and is decreasing from year to year. American cities\r\nhaving unpolluted water-supplies have comparatively few deaths from\r\nthis cause, although the figures never go so low as in Europe, perhaps\r\non account of the fresh cases which are always coming in from less\r\nhealthy neighborhoods in ever-moving American communities. In other\r\nAmerican cities the death-rates from typhoid fever are many times what\r\nthey ought to be and what they actually are in other cities, and the\r\nrates in various places, and in the same place at different times,\r\nbear in general a close relation to the extent of the pollution of the\r\ndrinking-water. The power of suitable filtration to protect a city from\r\ntyphoid fever is amply shown by the very low death-rates from this\r\ncause in London, Berlin, Breslau, and large numbers of other cities\r\ndrawing their raw water from sources more contaminated than those of\r\nany but the very worst American supplies, and by the marked and great\r\nreductions in the typhoid-fever death rates which have followed at once\r\nthe installation of filters at Zürich, Switzerland; Hamburg, Germany;\r\nLawrence, Mass., and other places.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the cities of 50,000 inhabitants and upward\r\nin the United States, with deaths from typhoid fever and the sources\r\nof their water-supplies. The deaths and populations are from the\r\nU. S. Census for 1890; the sources of the water-supplies, from the\r\n_American Water-Works Manual_ for the same year. Four cities of this\r\nsize—Grand Rapids, Lincoln, St. Joseph, and Des Moines—are not included\r\nin the census returns of mortality. Two cities with less than 50,000\r\ninhabitants with exceptionally high death-rates have been included, and\r\nat the foot of the list are given corresponding data for some large\r\nEuropean cities for 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPHOID FEVER DEATH-RATES AND WATER-SUPPLIES OF CITIES.\r\n\r\n  -----------------+-----------+--------------+-------------------------\r\n                   |           | Deaths from  |\r\n                   |           |   Typhoid    |\r\n                   |           |    Fever.    |\r\n        City.      |Population.+------+-------+      Water-supply.\r\n                   |           |      |  Per  |\r\n                   |           |Total.|100,000|\r\n                   |           |      |living.|\r\n  -----------------+-----------+------+-------+-------------------------\r\n      Birmingham   |    26,178 |  69  |  264  |Five Mile Creek\r\n   1.

Lower in the list, but still very\r\nhigh, Charleston, said to have been supplied only from artesian wells,\r\nhad an excessive rate; but the reported water-consumption is so low as\r\nto suggest that private wells or other means of supply were in common\r\nuse. Chicago and Cleveland both drew their water from lakes where they\r\nwere contaminated by their own sewage. St. Paul’s supply came from\r\nponds, of which I do not know the character. With these exceptions all\r\nof the 22 cities with over 50,000 inhabitants, at the head of the list,\r\nhad unfiltered river-water.\r\n\r\nThe cities supplied from impounding reservoirs as a rule had lower\r\ndeath rates and are at the lower end of the list, together with some\r\ncities taking their water supplies from rivers or lakes at points where\r\nthey were subject to only smaller or more remote infection. Only three\r\nof the American cities in the list were reported as being supplied\r\nentirely with ground-water.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to make too close comparisons between the various\r\ncities on the list; some of them may have been influenced by unusual\r\nlocal conditions in 1890. Others have in one way or another improved\r\ntheir water-supplies since that date, and there are several cities in\r\nwhich I know the present typhoid-fever death-rates to be materially\r\nlower than those of 1890 given in the table. On the other hand, it is\r\nequally true that a number of cities, including some of the larger\r\nones, have since had severe epidemics of typhoid fever which have given\r\nvery much higher rates than those for 1890.\r\n\r\nThese fluctuations would change the order of cities in the list from\r\nyear to year; they would not change the general facts, which are as\r\ntrue to-day as they were in 1890. Nearly all of the great cities of the\r\nUnited States are supplied with unfiltered surface-waters, and a great\r\nmajority of the waters are taken from rivers and lakes at points where\r\nthey are polluted by sewage. The death-rates from typhoid fever in\r\nthose cities, whether they are compared with better supplied cities of\r\nthis country, or with European cities, are enormously high.\r\n\r\nSuch rates were formerly common in European cities, but they have\r\ndisappeared with better sanitary conditions. The introduction of\r\nfilters has often worked marvellous changes in Europe, and in Lawrence\r\nthe improvement in the city’s health with filtered water was prompt\r\nand unquestionable. There is every reason to believe that the general\r\nintroduction of better water in American cities will work corresponding\r\nrevolutions; and looking at it from a merely money standpoint, the\r\nvalue of the lives and the saving of the expenses of sickness will pay\r\nhandsomely when compared with the cost of good water.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for believing that cholera is caused by polluted water\r\nare entirely similar to those in the case of typhoid fever. It was no\r\naccident that the epidemic of cholera which caused the death of 3400\r\npersons followed the temporary supply of unfiltered water by the East\r\nLondon Water Company in 1866, while the rest of London remained nearly\r\nfree, or that the only serious outbreak of cholera in Western Europe\r\nin 1892 was at Hamburg, which was also the only city in Germany which\r\nused raw river-water. This latter caused the sickness of 20,000 and the\r\ndeath of over 8000 people within a month, and an amount of suffering\r\nand financial loss, with the panics which resulted, that cannot be\r\nestimated, but that exceeded many times the cost of the filters which\r\nhave since been put in operation. Hamburg had several times before\r\nsuffered severely from cholera, and the removal of this danger was a\r\nleading, although not the sole, motive for the construction of filters.\r\n\r\nHow little cities supplied with pure water have to dread from\r\ncholera is shown by the experience of Altona and other suburbs of\r\nHamburg with good water-supplies, which had but few cases of cholera\r\nnot directly brought from the latter place, and by the experience\r\nof England, which maintained uninterrupted commercial intercourse\r\nwith the plague-stricken city, absolutely without quarantine, and,\r\nnotwithstanding a few cases which were directly imported, the disease\r\ngained no foothold in England.\r\n\r\nI do not know of a single modern European instance where a city with a\r\ngood water-supply not directly infected by sewage has suffered severely\r\nfrom cholera. I shall leave to others more familiar with the facts the\r\ndiscussion of what happened before the introduction of modern sanitary\r\nmethods, as well as of the present conditions in Asia; although I\r\nbelieve that in these cases also there is plenty of evidence as to the\r\npart water plays in the spread of the disease.\r\n\r\nA considerable proportion of the water-supplies of the cities of the\r\nUnited States are so polluted that in case cholera should gain a\r\nfoothold upon our shores we have no ground for hoping for the favorable\r\nexperience of the English cities rather than the plague of Hamburg in\r\n1892.\r\n\r\nThe fæces from a man contain on an average perhaps 1,000,000,000\r\nbacteria per gram,[47] most of them being the normal bacilli of\r\nthe intestines, _Bacillus coli communis_. Assuming that a man\r\ndischarges 200 grams or about 7 ounces of fæces daily, this would give\r\n200,000,000,000 bacteria discharged daily per person. The number of\r\nbacteria actually found in American sewage is usually higher, often\r\ndouble this number per person; but there are other sources of bacteria\r\nin sewage, and in addition growths or the reverse may take place in the\r\nsewers, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis number of bacteria in sewage is so enormously large that the\r\naddition of the sewage from a village or city to even a large river\r\nis capable of affecting its entire bacterial composition. Thus taking\r\nthe population of Lowell in 1892 at 85,000, and the average daily\r\nflow of the Merrimac at 6000 cubic feet per second, and assuming that\r\n200,000,000,000 bacteria are discharged daily in the sewage from each\r\nperson, they would increase the number in the river by 1160\r\n\r\nper cubic centimeter, or about 300,000 in an ordinary glass of water.\r\nThe average number found in the water eight miles below, at the intake\r\nof the Lawrence water-works, was more than six times as great as this,\r\ndue in part to the sewage of other cities higher up.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that the bulk of these bacteria were\r\nharmless to the people of Lawrence, who drank them; but some of them\r\nwere not. Fæces of people suffering from typhoid fever contain the\r\ngerms of that disease. What proportion of the total number of bacteria\r\nin such fæces are injurious is not known; but assuming that one fourth\r\nonly of the total number are typhoid germs, and supposing the fæces of\r\none man to be evenly mixed with the whole daily average flow of the\r\nriver, it would put one typhoid germ into every glass of water at the\r\nLawrence intake, and at low water several times as many proportionately\r\nwould be added. This gives some conception of the dilution required to\r\nmake a polluted water safe.\r\n\r\nOne often hears of the growth of disease-germs in water, but as far\r\nas the northern United States and Europe are concerned there is no\r\nevidence whatever that this ever takes place. There are harmless forms\r\nof bacteria which are capable of growing upon less food than the\r\ndisease-germs require and they often multiply in badly-polluted waters.\r\nTyphoid-fever germs live for a longer or shorter period, and finally\r\ndie without growth. The few laboratory experiments which have seemed\r\nto show an increase of typhoid germs in water have been made under\r\nconditions so widely different from those of natural watercourses that\r\nthey have no value.[48]\r\n\r\nThe proportionate number of cases of typhoid fever among the users\r\nof a polluted water varies with the number of typhoid germs in the\r\nwater. Excessive pollution causes severe epidemics or continued high\r\ndeath-rates according as the infection is continued or intermittent.\r\nSlight infection causes relatively few cases of fever. Pittsburg and\r\nAllegheny, taking their water-supplies from below the outlets of some\r\nof their own sewers, have suffered severely (103.2 and 127.4 deaths\r\nfrom typhoid fever annually per 100,000, respectively, from 1888 to\r\n1892). Wheeling, W. Va., with similar conditions in 1890, was even\r\nworse, a death rate of 345 per 100,000 from this cause being reported,\r\nwhile Albany had only comparatively mild epidemics from the less\r\ndirectly and grossly polluted Hudson. Lawrence and Lowell, taking their\r\nwater from the Merrimac, both had for many years continued excessive\r\nrates, increasing gradually with increasing pollution; and the city\r\nhaving the most polluted source had the higher rate.\r\n\r\nIn Berlin and Altona, in winter, with open filters, epidemics of\r\ntyphoid fever followed decreased efficiency of filtration, but the\r\nepidemics were often so mild that they would have entirely escaped\r\nobservation under present American conditions. Chicago has for years\r\nsuffered from typhoid fever, and the rate has fluctuated, as far as\r\nreliable information can be obtained, with the fluctuations in the\r\npollution of the lake water. An unusual discharge of the Chicago River\r\nresults in a higher death-rate. Abandoning the shore inlet near the\r\nmouth of the Chicago River in 1892, resulted in the following year in\r\na reduction of 60 per cent in the typhoid fever death-rate.[49] This\r\nreduction shows, not that the present intakes are safe, but simply that\r\nthey are less polluted than the old ones to an extent measured by the\r\nreduction in the death-rate.\r\n\r\nIt is not supposed that in an epidemic of typhoid fever caused by\r\npolluted water every single person contracts the disease directly by\r\n\r\ndrinking the water. On the contrary, typhoid fever is often\r\ncommunicated in other ways. If we have in the first place a thousand\r\ncases in a city caused directly by the water, they will be followed\r\nby a large number of other cases resulting directly from the presence\r\nin the city of the first thousand cases. The conditions favoring this\r\nspread may vary in different wards, resulting in considerable local\r\nvariations in the death-rates. Some persons also will suffer who did\r\nnot drink any tap-water. These facts, always noted in epidemics, afford\r\nno ground for refusing to believe, in the presence of direct evidence,\r\nthat the water was the cause of the fever. These additional cases are\r\nthe indirect if not the direct result of the water. The broad fact that\r\ncities with polluted water-supplies as a rule have high typhoid-fever\r\ndeath-rates, and cities with good water-supplies do not (except in the\r\noccasional cases of milk epidemics, or where they are overrun by cases\r\ncontracted in neighboring cities with bad water, as is the case with\r\nsome of Chicago’s suburbs), is at once the best evidence of the damage\r\nfrom bad water and measure of its extent.\r\n\r\nThe conditions which remove or destroy the sewage bacteria in a water\r\ntend to make it safe. The most important of them are: (1) dilution; (2)\r\ntime, allowing the bacteria to die (sunlight may aid in this process,\r\nalthough effective sunshine cannot reach the lower layer of turbid\r\nwaters or through ice); (3) sedimentation, allowing them to go to\r\nthe bottom, where they eventually die; and (4) natural or artificial\r\nfiltration. In rivers, distance is mainly useful in affording time,\r\nand also, under some conditions, in allowing opportunities for\r\nsedimentation. Thus a distance of 500 miles requires a week for water\r\ntravelling three miles an hour to pass, and will allow very important\r\nchanges to take place. The old theory that water purifies itself\r\nin running a certain distance has no adequate foundation as far as\r\nbacteria are concerned. Some purification takes place with the time\r\ninvolved in the passage, but its extent has been greatly overestimated.\r\n\r\nThe time required for the bacteria to die simply from natural causes\r\nis considerable; certainly not less than three or four weeks can\r\nbe depended upon with any confidence. In storage reservoirs this\r\naction is often considerable, and it is for this reason that American\r\nwater-supplies from large storage reservoirs are, as a rule, much more\r\nhealthy than those drawn from rivers or polluted lakes, even when the\r\nsources of the former are somewhat polluted. The water-supplies of New\r\nYork and Boston may be cited as examples. In many other water-works\r\noperations the entire time from the pollution to the consumption of\r\nthe water is but a few days or even less, and time does not materially\r\nimprove water in this period.\r\n\r\nSedimentation removes bacteria only slowly, as might be expected from\r\ntheir exceedingly small size; and in addition their specific gravity\r\nprobably is but slightly greater than that of water. The Lawrence\r\nreservoir, holding from 10 to 14 days’ supply, effected, by the\r\ncombined effect of time and sedimentation, a reduction of 90 per cent\r\nof the bacteria in the raw water. In spite of this the city suffered\r\nseverely and continuously from fever. It would probably have suffered\r\neven more, however, had it not been for this reduction. Nothing is\r\nknown of the removal of bacteria by sedimentation from flowing rivers,\r\nbut, considering the slowness with which the process takes place in\r\nstanding water, it is evident that we cannot hope for very much in\r\nstreams, and especially rapid streams, where the opportunities for\r\nsedimentation are still less favorable.\r\n\r\nFiltration as practiced in Europe removes promptly and certainly a very\r\nlarge proportion of the bacteria—probably, under all proper conditions,\r\nover 99 per cent, and is thus much more effective in purification\r\nthan even weeks of storage or long flows in rivers. The places using\r\nfiltered water have, in general, extremely low death-rates from typhoid\r\nfever. The fever which has occurred at a few places drawing their\r\nraw water from greatly polluted sources has resulted from improper\r\nconditions which can be avoided, and affords no ground for doubt of the\r\nefficiency of properly conducted filtration.\r\n\r\nCorresponding evidence has not yet been produced in connection with\r\nthe mechanical filters which have been largely used in the United\r\nStates; but the bacterial efficiencies secured with them, under proper\r\nconditions, and with enough coagulant, have been such as to warrant the\r\nbelief that they also will serve to greatly diminish the danger from\r\nsuch infection, although they have not shown themselves equal in this\r\nrespect to sand filters.\r\n\r\nThe main point is that disease-germs shall not be present in our\r\ndrinking-water. If they can be kept out in the first place at\r\nreasonable expense, that is the thing to do. Innocence is better\r\nthan repentance. If they cannot be kept out, we must take them out\r\nafterwards; it does not matter much how this is done, so long as the\r\nwork is thorough. Sedimentation and storage may accomplish much, but\r\ntheir action is too slow and often uncertain. Filtration properly\r\ncarried out removes bacteria promptly and thoroughly and at a\r\nreasonable expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix I.\r\n\r\n RULES OF THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT IN REGARD TO THE FILTRATION OF\r\n SURFACE-WATERS USED FOR PUBLIC WATER-SUPPLIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nRules somewhat similar to those of which a translation is given\r\nbelow were first issued by the Imperial Board of Health in 1892.\r\nThese rules were regarded as unnecessarily rigid, and a petition was\r\npresented to the government signed by 37 water-works engineers and\r\ndirectors requesting a revision.[50] As a result a conference was\r\norganized consisting of 14 members.[51] Köhler presided, and Koch,\r\nGaffsky, Werner, Günther, and Reincke represented the Imperial Board\r\nof Health. The bacteriologists were represented by Flügge, Wolffhügel,\r\nand Fränkel, while Beer, Fischer, Lindley, Meyer, and Piefke were the\r\nengineer members.\r\n\r\nThis conference prepared the 17 articles given below in the first\r\ndays of January, 1894. A little later the first 16 articles were\r\nissued to all German local authorities, signed by Bosse, minister of\r\nthe “Geistlichen,” and Haase, minister of the interior, and they are\r\nconsidered as binding upon all water-works using surface-water. The\r\nbacterial examinations were commenced April 1, 1894, by most of the\r\ncities which had not previously had them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the articles do not deal with rate of filtration, or the\r\nprecautions against snow and ice, they have a very great interest both\r\nbecause they are an official expression, and on account of the personal\r\nstanding of the men who prepared them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n§ 1. In judging of the quality of a filtered surface-water the\r\nfollowing points should be especially observed:\r\n\r\n_a_. The operation of a filter is to be regarded as satisfactory\r\nwhen the filtrate contains the smallest possible number of bacteria,\r\nnot exceeding the number which practical experience has shown to be\r\nattainable with good filtration at the works in question. In those\r\ncases where there are no previous records showing the possibilities of\r\nthe works and the influence of the local conditions, especially the\r\ncharacter of the raw water, and until such information is obtained,\r\nit is to be taken as the rule that a satisfactory filtration will\r\nnever yield an effluent with more than about 100 bacteria per cubic\r\ncentimeter.\r\n\r\n_b_. The filtrate must be as clear as possible, and, in regard to\r\ncolor, taste, temperature, and chemical composition, must be no worse\r\nthan the raw water.\r\n\r\n§ 2. To allow a complete and constant control of the bacterial\r\nefficiency of filtration, the filtrate from each single filter must be\r\nexamined daily. Any sudden increase in the number of bacteria should\r\ncause a suspicion of some unusual disturbance in the filter, and should\r\nmake the superintendent more attentive to the possible causes of it.\r\n\r\n§ 3. Filters must be so constructed that samples of the effluent\r\nfrom any one of them can be taken at any desired time for the\r\nbacteriological examination mentioned in § 1.\r\n\r\n§ 4. In order to secure uniformity of method, the following is\r\nrecommended as the standard method for bacterial examination:\r\n\r\nThe nutrient medium consists of 10 per cent meat extract gelatine with\r\npeptone, 10 cc. of which is used for each experiment. Two samples of\r\nthe water under examination are to be taken, one of 1 cc. and one\r\nof 1/2 cc. The gelatine is melted at a temperature of 30° to 35° C.,\r\nand mixed with the water as thoroughly as possible in the test-tube\r\nby tipping back and forth, and is then poured upon a sterile glass\r\nplate. The plates are put under a bell-jar which stands upon a piece\r\nof blotting-paper saturated with water, and in a room in which the\r\ntemperature is about 20° C.\r\n\r\nThe resulting colonies are counted after 48 hours, and with the aid of\r\na lens.\r\n\r\nIf the temperature of the room in which the plates are kept is lower\r\nthan the above, the development of the colonies is slower, and the\r\ncounting must be correspondingly postponed.\r\n\r\nIf the number of colonies in 1 cc. of the water is greater than about\r\n100, the counting must be done with the help of the Wolffhügel’s\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\n§ 5. The person entrusted with the carrying-out of the bacterial\r\nexaminations must present a certificate that he possesses the necessary\r\nqualifications, and wherever possible he shall be a regular employé of\r\nthe water-works.\r\n\r\n§ 6. When the effluent from a filter does not correspond to the\r\nhygienic requirements it must not be used, unless the cause of the\r\nunsatisfactory work has already been removed during the period covered\r\nby the bacterial examinations.\r\n\r\nIn case a filter for more than a very short time yields a poor\r\neffluent, it is to be put out of service until the cause of the trouble\r\nis found and corrected.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, recognized from past experience that sometimes\r\nunavoidable conditions (high water, etc.) make it impossible, from an\r\nengineering standpoint, to secure an effluent of the quality stated\r\nin § 1. In such cases it will be necessary to get along with a poorer\r\nquality of water; but at the same time, if the conditions demand it\r\n(outbreak of an epidemic, etc.), a suitable notice should be issued.\r\n\r\n§ 7. Every single filter must be so built that, when an inferior\r\neffluent results, which does not conform to the requirements, it can be\r\ndisconnected from the pure-water pipes and the filtrate allowed to be\r\nwasted, as mentioned in § 6. This wasting should in general take place,\r\nso far as the arrangement of the works will permit it:\r\n\r\n(1) Immediately after scraping a filter; and\r\n\r\n(2) After replacing the sand to the original depth.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent must himself judge, from previous experience with\r\nthe continual bacterial examinations, whether it is necessary to waste\r\nthe water after these operations, and, if so, how long a time will\r\nprobably elapse before the water reaches the standard purity.\r\n\r\n§ 8. The best sand-filtration requires a liberal area of\r\nfilter-surface, allowing plenty of reserve, to secure, under all local\r\nconditions, a moderate rate of filtration adapted to the character of\r\nthe raw water.\r\n\r\n§ 9. Every single filter shall be independently regulated, and the\r\nrate of filtration, loss of head, and character of the effluent shall\r\nbe known. Also each filter shall, by itself, be capable of being\r\ncompletely emptied, and, after scraping, of having filtered water\r\nintroduced from below until the sand is filled to the surface.\r\n\r\n§ 10. The velocity of filtration in each single filter shall be capable\r\nof being arranged to give the most favorable results, and shall be as\r\nregular as possible, quite free from sudden changes or interruptions.\r\nOn this account reservoirs must be provided large enough to balance the\r\nhourly fluctuation in the consumption of water.\r\n\r\n§ 11. The filters shall be so arranged that their working shall not be\r\ninfluenced by the fluctuating level of the water in the filtered-water\r\nreservoir or pump-well.\r\n\r\n§ 12. The loss of head shall not be allowed to become so great as\r\nto cause a breaking through of the upper layer on the surface of\r\nthe filter. The limit to which the loss of head can be allowed to\r\ngo without damage is to be determined for each works by bacterial\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\n§ 13. Filters shall be constructed throughout in such a way as to\r\ninsure the equal action of every part of their area.\r\n\r\n§ 14. The sides and bottoms of filters must be made water-tight, and\r\nspecial pains must be taken to avoid the danger of passages or loose\r\nplaces through which the unfiltered water on the filter might find its\r\nway to the filtered-water channels. To this end special pains should be\r\ntaken to make and keep the ventilators for the filtered-water channels\r\nabsolutely tight.\r\n\r\n§ 15. The thickness of the sand-layer shall be so great that under no\r\ncircumstances shall it be reduced by scraping to less than 30 cm. (=\r\n12 inches), and it is desirable, so far as local conditions allow, to\r\nincrease this minimum limit.\r\n\r\nSpecial attention must be given to the upper layer of sand, which must\r\nbe arranged and continually kept in the condition most favorable for\r\nfiltration. For this reason it is desirable that, after a filter has\r\nbeen reduced in thickness by scraping and is about to be refilled, the\r\nsand below the surface, as far as it is discolored, should be removed\r\nbefore bringing on the new sand.\r\n\r\n§ 16. Every city in the German empire using sand-filtered water is\r\nrequested to make a quarterly report of its working results, especially\r\nof the bacterial character of the water before and after filtration,\r\nto the Imperial Board of Health (Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamt), which\r\nwill keep itself in communication with the commission chosen by the\r\nwater-works engineers in regard to these questions; and it is believed\r\nthat after such statistical information is obtained for a period of\r\nabout two years some farther judgments can be reached.\r\n\r\n§ 17. The question as to the establishment of a permanent inspection\r\nof public water-works, and, if so, under what conditions, can be best\r\nanswered after the receipt of the information indicated in § 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM “BERICHT DES MEDICINAL-INSPECTORATS DES HAMBURGISCHEN\r\nSTAATES FÜR DAS JAHR 1892.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following are translations from Dr. Reincke’s most valuable report\r\nupon the vital statistics of Hamburg for 1892. I much regret that I am\r\nunable to reproduce in full the very complete and instructive tables\r\nand diagrams which accompany the report.\r\n\r\n=Diarrhœa and Cholera Infantum= (page 10). “It is usually assumed that\r\nthe increase of diarrhœal diseases in summer is to be explained by\r\nthe high temperature, especially by the action of the heat upon the\r\nprincipal food of infants—milk. Our observations, however, indicate\r\nthat a deeper cause must be sought.” (Tables and diagrams of deaths\r\nfrom cholera infantum by months for Hamburg and for Altona with the\r\nmean temperatures, 1871-1892.)\r\n\r\n“From these it appears that the highest monthly mortality of each year\r\nin Hamburg occurred 7 times in July, 13 times in August, and 3 times\r\nin September, and substantially the same in Altona. If one compares\r\nthe corresponding temperatures, it is found that in the three years\r\n1886, 1891, and 1892, with high September mortalities, especially the\r\nfirst two of them, had their maximum temperature much earlier, in fact\r\nearlier than usual. Throughout, the correspondence between deaths and\r\ntemperatures is not well marked. Repeated high temperatures in May and\r\nJune have never been followed by a notable amount of cholera infantum,\r\nalthough such periods have lasted for a considerable time. For example,\r\ntoward the end of May, 1892, for a long time the temperature was higher\r\nthan in the following August, when the cholera infantum appeared.\r\n\r\n“The following observations are still more interesting. As is seen\r\nfrom the diagram, in addition to the annual rise in summer there is\r\nalso a smaller increase in the winter, which is especially marked\r\nin Altona. In 1892 this winter outbreak was greater than the summer\r\none, and nearly as great in 1880 and in 1888. The few years when\r\nthis winter increase was not marked, 1876-7, 1877-8, 1881-2, 1883-4,\r\nwere warm winters in which the mean temperature did not go below the\r\nfreezing-point. It is also to be noted that the time of this winter\r\noutbreak is much more variable than that of the summer one. In 1887 the\r\ngreatest mortality was in November; in 1889 in February; in other years\r\nin December or January, and in Altona, in 1886 and 1888, in March,\r\nwhich is sufficient evidence that it was not the result of Christmas\r\nfestivities.\r\n\r\n“Farther, the winter diarrhœa of Hamburg and of Altona are not parallel\r\nas is the case in summer. In Hamburg the greatest mortality generally\r\ncomes before New Year’s; in Altona one to two months later.\r\n\r\n“In Bockendahl’s Generalbericht über das öffentliche Gesundheitswesen\r\nder Provinz Schleswig-Holstein für das Jahr 1870, page 10, we read:\r\n‘Yet more remarkable was an epidemic of cholera infantum in Altona\r\nin February which proved fatal to 43 children. These cases were\r\ndistributed in every part of the city, and could not be explained\r\nby the health officer until he ascertained that the water company\r\nhad supplied unfiltered water to the city. This occurred for a few\r\ndays only in January, and was the only time in the whole year that\r\nunfiltered Elbe water was delivered. However little reason there may\r\nbe to believe that there was a connection between these circumstances,\r\nfuture interruptions of the service of filtered water should be most\r\ncritically watched, as only in this way can reliable conclusions be\r\nreached. Without attempting to draw any scientific conclusions from\r\nthe fact, I cannot do less than record that, prior to the outbreak\r\nof cholera on August 20, 1871, unfiltered together with filtered\r\nwater had been supplied to the city August 11 to 18. The action of\r\nthe authorities was then justified when they forbade in future the\r\nsupply of unfiltered water except in cases of most urgent necessity,\r\nas in case of general conflagration; and in such a case, or in case of\r\ninterruption due to broken pipes, that the public should be suitably\r\nwarned.’\r\n\r\n“The author of this paragraph, Dr. Kraus, became later the health\r\nofficer of Hamburg, and in an opinion written by him in 1874, and now\r\nbefore me, he most earnestly urged the adoption of sand-filtration in\r\nHamburg, and cites the above observations in support of his position.\r\nIn the annual report of vital statistics of Hamburg for 1875 he says\r\nthat it is quite possible that the addition of unfiltered Elbe water\r\nto milk is the cause of the high mortality from cholera infantum, as\r\ncompared with London, and this idea was often afterward expressed by\r\nhim. Since then so much evidence has accumulated that his view may\r\nfairly be considered proved.\r\n\r\n“For the information of readers not familiar with local conditions,\r\na mention of the sources of the water-supplies up to the present\r\ntime used by Hamburg and Altona will be useful. Both cities take\r\ntheir entire water-supplies from the Elbe—Altona from a point about 7\r\nmiles below the discharge of the sewage of both cities, Hamburg from\r\nabout 7 miles above. The raw water at Altona is thus polluted by the\r\nsewage from the population of both cities, having now together over\r\n700,000 inhabitants, and contains in general 20,000 to 40,000 or more\r\nbacteria per cubic centimeter. The raw water of Hamburg has, however,\r\naccording to the time of year and tide, from 200 to 5000, but here also\r\noccasionally much higher numbers are obtained when the ebb tide carries\r\nsewage up to the intake. How often this takes place is not accurately\r\nknown, but most frequently in summer when the river is low, more rarely\r\nin winter and in times of flood. Recent bacterial examinations show\r\nthat it occurs much more frequently than was formerly assumed from\r\nfloat experiments. This water is pumped directly to the city raw, while\r\nthat for Altona is carefully filtered.\r\n\r\n“Years ago I expressed the opinion that the repeated typhoid epidemics\r\nin Altona stood in direct connection with disturbances of the action\r\nof the filters by frost, which result in the supply of insufficiently\r\npurified water. Wallichs in Altona has also come to this conclusion\r\nas a result of extended observation, and recently Robert Koch has\r\nexplained the little winter epidemic of cholera in Altona in the same\r\nway, thus supporting our theory. When open filters are cleaned in cold,\r\nfrosty weather the bacteria in the water are not sufficiently held back\r\nby the filters. Such disturbances of filtration not only preceded the\r\nexplosive epidemics of typhoid fever of 1886, 1887, 1888, 1891, and\r\n1892, and the cholera outbreaks of 1871 and 1893, but also the winter\r\noutbreaks of cholera infantum which have been so often repeated. It\r\ncannot be doubted that these phenomena bear the relation to each other\r\nof cause and effect. It is thus explained why in the warm winters no\r\nsuch outbreaks have taken place, and also why the cholera infantum in\r\nwinter is not parallel in Hamburg and Altona.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“A farther support of this idea is furnished by Berlin, where in the\r\nsame way frost has repeatedly interfered with filtration. In the\r\nfollowing table are shown the deaths from diarrhœa and cholera infantum\r\nfor a few winter periods having unusual increases in mortality in\r\ncomparison with the bacteria in the water-supply.” (These tables show\r\nthat in March, 1886, March, 1888, February-March, 1889, and February,\r\n1891, high numbers of bacteria resulted from frost disturbance at\r\nthe Stralau works, and in every case they were followed by greatly\r\nincreased death-rates from diarrhœal diseases.—A. H.)\r\n\r\n“No one who sees this exhibition can doubt that here also the supply\r\nof inadequately purified water has every time cost the lives of many\r\nchildren.” (100 to 400 or more each time.—A. H.) “Even more conclusive\r\nis the evidence, published by the Berlin Health Office, that this\r\nincrease was confined to those parts of the city supplied from Stralau”\r\n(with open filters.—A. H.), “and that the parts supplied from the\r\nbetter Tegel works took no part in the outbreaks, which was exactly\r\nthe case with the well-known typhoid epidemic of February and March,\r\n1889.... It was also found that those children nursed by their mothers\r\nor by wet-nurses did not suffer, but only those fed on the milk of\r\nanimals or other substitutes, and which in any case were mixed with\r\nmore or less water.”\r\n\r\nUnder =Cholera=, page 28, he says: “The revised statistics here given\r\ndiffer slightly from preliminary figures previously issued and widely\r\npublished.” (The full tables, which cannot be here reproduced, show\r\n16,956 cases and 8605 deaths. 8146 of the deaths occurred in the month\r\nending September 21. Of these, 1799 were under 5 years old; 776 were 5\r\nto 15; 744, 15 to 25; 3520, 25 to 50; 1369, 50 to 70; and 397 over 70\r\nor of unknown age. The bulk of the cases were thus among mature people,\r\nchildren, except very young children, suffering the least severely of\r\nany age class.)\r\n\r\n“The epidemic began on August 16, in the port where earlier outbreaks\r\nhave also had their origin. The original source of the infection\r\nhas not been ascertained with certainty, but was probably from one\r\nof two sources. Either it came from certain Jews, just arrived from\r\ncholera-stricken Russia, who were encamped in large numbers near the\r\nAmerican pier, or the infection came from Havre, where cholera had been\r\npresent from the middle of July. Perhaps the germs came in ships in\r\nwater-ballast which was discharged at Hamburg, which is so much more\r\nprobable, as the sewage of Havre is discharged directly into the docks.\r\n\r\n“It is remarkable that in Altona, compared to the total number of\r\ncases, very few children had cholera, while in the epidemic of 1871 the\r\nchildren suffered severely. This may be explained by supposing that the\r\ncholera of 1892 in Altona was not introduced by water, but by other\r\nmeans of infection....\r\n\r\n“It is well known that the drinking-water (of Hamburg) is supposed to\r\nhave been from the first the carrier of the cholera-germs. In support\r\nof this view the following points are especially to be noted:\r\n\r\n“1. The explosive rapidity of attack. The often-compared epidemic\r\nin Munich in 1854, which could not have come from the water is\r\ncharacteristically different in that its rise was much slower and was\r\nfollowed by a gradual decline. In Hamburg, with six times as large a\r\npopulation, the height of the epidemic was reached August 27, only 12\r\ndays after the first cases of sickness, while in Munich 25 days were\r\nrequired. In Hamburg also the bulk of the cases were confined to 12\r\ndays, from August 25 to September 5, while in Munich the time was twice\r\nas long.\r\n\r\n“2. The exact limit of the epidemic to the political boundary between\r\nHamburg and Altona and Wandsbeck, which also agrees with the boundary\r\nbetween the respective water-supplies, while other differences were\r\nentirely absent. Hamburg had for 1000 inhabitants 26.31 cases and 13.39\r\ndeaths, but Altona only 3.81 cases and 2.13 deaths, and Wandsbeck 3.06\r\ncases and 2.09 deaths.\r\n\r\n“3. The old experience of cholera in fresh-water ports, and the analogy\r\nof many earlier epidemics. In this connection the above-mentioned\r\nepidemic of 1871 in Altona has a special interest, even though some\r\nof the conclusions of Bockendahl’s in his report of 1871 are open to\r\nobjection. First there were 3 deaths August 3, which were not at once\r\nfollowed by others. Then unfiltered Elbe water was supplied August 11\r\nto 18. On the 19th an outbreak of cholera extended to all parts of\r\nthe city, which reached its height August 25 and 26, and afterwards\r\ngradually decreased. In all 105 persons died of cholera and 186 (179 of\r\nthem children) of diarrhœa. In Hamburg, four times as large, only 141\r\npersons died of cholera at this time, thus proportionately a smaller\r\nnumber. The conditions were then the reverse of those of 1892, an\r\ninfection of the Altona water and a comparative immunity in Hamburg.\r\n\r\n“It is objected that the cholera-germs were not found in the water\r\nin 1892. To my knowledge they were first looked for, and then\r\nwith imperfect methods, in the second half of September. In the\r\nafter-epidemics at Altona, they were found in the river-water by R.\r\nKoch by the use of better methods.\r\n\r\n“It is quite evident that the germs were also distributed by other\r\nmethods than by the city water, especially by dock-laborers who became\r\ninfected while at their work and thus set up little secondary epidemics\r\nwhere they went or lived.... These laborers and sailors, especially on\r\nthe smaller river-boats, had an enormously greater proportionate amount\r\nof cholera than others.... These laborers do not live exclusively near\r\nthe water, but to a measure in all parts of the city.” (And in Altona\r\nand Wandsbeck.—A. H.)\r\n\r\n“Altona had 5 deaths from cholera December 25 to January 4, and 19\r\nJanuary 23 to February 11, and no more. As noted above, this is\r\nattributed to the water-supply, and to defective filtration in presence\r\nof frost....\r\n\r\n“The cholera could never have reached the proportion which it did, had\r\nthe improvements in the drinking-water been earlier completed.”\r\n\r\nFurther accounts of the water-supplies of Altona and of Hamburg and of\r\nthe new filtration works at the latter city are given in Appendices VII\r\nand VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF SAND-ANALYSIS.\r\n\r\n(From the Annual Report of the Massachusetts State Board of Health for\r\n1892.)\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the sizes of the sand-grains forms the basis of many of\r\nthe computations. This information is obtained by means of mechanical\r\nanalyses. The sand sample is separated into portions having grains\r\nof definite sizes, and from the weight of the several portions the\r\nrelative quantities of grains of any size can be computed.\r\n\r\n=Collection of Samples.=—In shipping and handling, samples of sand\r\nare best kept in their natural moist condition, as there is then no\r\ntendency to separation into portions of unequal-sized grains. Under no\r\ncircumstances should different materials be mixed in the same sample.\r\nIf the material under examination is not homogeneous, samples of each\r\ngrade should be taken in separate bottles, with proper notes in regard\r\nto location, quantity, etc. Eight-ounce wide-necked bottles are most\r\nconvenient for sand samples, but with gravels a larger quantity is\r\noften required. Duplicate samples for comparison after obtaining the\r\nresults of analyses are often useful.\r\n\r\n=Separation into Portions having Grains of Definite Sizes.=—Three\r\nmethods are employed for particles of different sizes—hand-picking\r\nfor the stones, sieves for the sands, and water elutriation for the\r\nextremely fine particles. Ignition, or determination of albuminoid\r\nammonia, might be added for determining the quantity of organic matter,\r\nwhich, as a matter of convenience, is assumed to consist of particles\r\nless than 0.01 millimeter in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe method of hand-picking is ordinarily applied only to particles\r\nwhich remain on a sieve two meshes to an inch. The stones of this size\r\nare spread out so that all are in sight, and a definite number of the\r\nlargest are selected and weighed. The diameter is calculated from the\r\naverage weight by the method to be described, while the percentage is\r\nreckoned from the total weight. Another set of the largest remaining\r\nstones is then picked out and weighed as before, and so on until the\r\nsample is exhausted. With a little practice the eye enables one to pick\r\nout the largest stones quite accurately.\r\n\r\nWith smaller particles this process becomes too laborious, on account\r\nof the large number of particles, and sieves are therefore used\r\ninstead. The sand for sifting must be entirely free from moisture, and\r\nis ordinarily dried in an oven at a temperature somewhat above the\r\nboiling-point. The quantity taken for analysis should rarely exceed\r\n100-200 grams. The sieves are made from carefully-selected brass-wire\r\ngauze, having, as nearly as possible, square and even-sized meshes. The\r\nframes are of metal, fitting into each other so that several sieves can\r\nbe used at once without loss of material. It is a great convenience to\r\nhave a mechanical shaker, which will take a series of sieves and give\r\nthem a uniform and sufficient shaking in a short time; but without this\r\ngood results can be obtained by hand-shaking. A series which has proved\r\nvery satisfactory has sieves with approximately 2, 4, 6, 10, 20, 40,\r\n70, 100, 140, and 200 meshes to an inch; but the exact numbers are of\r\nno consequence, as the actual sizes of the particles are relied upon,\r\nand not the number of meshes to an inch.\r\n\r\nIt can be easily shown by experiment that when a mixed sand is shaken\r\nupon a sieve the smaller particles pass first, and as the shaking\r\nis continued larger and larger particles pass, until the limit is\r\nreached when almost nothing will pass. The last and largest particles\r\npassing are collected and measured, and they represent the separation\r\nof that sieve. The size of separation of a sieve bears a tolerably\r\ndefinite relation to the size of the mesh, but the relation is not to\r\nbe depended upon, owing to the irregularities in the meshes and also\r\nto the fact that the finer sieves are woven on a different pattern\r\nfrom the coarser ones, and the particles passing the finer sieves are\r\nsomewhat larger in proportion to the mesh than is the case with the\r\ncoarser sieves. For these reasons the sizes of the sand-grains are\r\ndetermined by actual measurements, regardless of the size of the mesh\r\nof the sieve.\r\n\r\nIt has not been found practicable to extend the sieve-separations to\r\nparticles below 0.10 millimeter in diameter (corresponding to a sieve\r\nwith about 200 meshes to an inch), and for such particles elutriation\r\nis used. The portion passing the finest sieve contains the greater\r\npart of the organic matter of the sample, with the exception of roots\r\nand other large undecomposed matters, and it is usually best to remove\r\nthis organic matter by ignition at the lowest possible heat before\r\nproceeding to the water-separations. The loss in weight is regarded as\r\norganic matter, and calculated as below 0.01 millimeter in diameter.\r\nIn case the mineral matter is decomposed by the necessary heat, the\r\nignition must be omitted, and an approximate equivalent can be obtained\r\nby multiplying the albuminoid ammonia of the sample by 50.[52] In this\r\ncase it is necessary to deduct an equivalent amount from the other fine\r\nportions, as otherwise the analyses when expressed in percentages would\r\nadd up to more than one hundred.\r\n\r\nFive grams of the ignited fine particles are put in a beaker 90\r\nmillimeters high and holding about 230 cubic centimeters. The beaker\r\nis then nearly filled with distilled water at a temperature of 20° C.,\r\nand thoroughly mixed by blowing into it air through a glass tube. A\r\nlarger quantity of sand than 5 grams will not settle uniformly in the\r\nquantity of water given, but less can be used if desired. The rapidity\r\nof settlement depends upon the temperature of the water, so that it is\r\nquite important that no material variation in temperature should occur.\r\nThe mixed sand and water is allowed to stand for fifteen seconds, when\r\nmost of the supernatant liquid, carrying with it the greater part of\r\nthe particles less than 0.08 millimeter, is rapidly decanted into a\r\nsuitable vessel, and the remaining sand is again mixed with an equal\r\namount of fresh water, which is again poured off after fifteen seconds,\r\ncarrying with it most of the remaining fine particles. This process is\r\nonce more repeated, after which the remaining sand is allowed to drain,\r\nand is then dried and weighed, and calculated as above 0.08 millimeter\r\nin diameter. The finer decanted sand will have sufficiently settled\r\nin a few minutes, and the coarser parts at the bottom are washed back\r\ninto the beaker and treated with water exactly as before, except that\r\none minute interval is now allowed for settling. The sand remaining\r\nis calculated as above 0.04 millimeter, and the portion below 0.04 is\r\nestimated by difference, as its direct determination is very tedious,\r\nand no more accurate than the estimation by difference when sufficient\r\ncare is used.\r\n\r\n=Determination of the Sizes of the Sand-grains.=—The sizes of the\r\nsand-grains can be determined in either of two ways—from the weight of\r\nthe particles or from micrometer measurements. For convenience the size\r\nof each particle is considered to be the diameter of a sphere of equal\r\nvolume. When the weight and specific gravity of a particle are known,\r\nthe diameter can be readily calculated. The volume of a sphere is\r\n1/6π_d_³, and is also equal to the weight divided by the specific\r\ngravity. With the Lawrence materials the specific gravity is uniformly\r\n2.65 within very narrow limits, and we have _w_/2.65 = 1/6π_d_³.\r\nSolving for _d_ we obtain the formula _d_ =.9∛_w_, where _d_\r\nis the diameter of a particle in millimeters and _w_ its weight in\r\nmilligrams. As the average weight of particles, when not too small,\r\ncan be determined with precision, this method is very accurate, and\r\naltogether the most satisfactory for particles above 0.10 millimeter;\r\nthat is, for all sieve separations. For the finer particles the method\r\nis inapplicable, on account of the vast number of particles to be\r\ncounted in the smallest portion which can be accurately weighed, and\r\nin these cases the sizes are determined by micrometer measurements.\r\nAs the sand-grains are not spherical or even regular in shape,\r\nconsiderable care is required to ascertain the true mean diameter. The\r\nmost accurate method is to measure the long diameter and the middle\r\ndiameter at right angles to it, as seen by a microscope. The short\r\ndiameter is obtained by a micrometer screw, focussing first upon the\r\nglass upon which the particle rests and then upon the highest point to\r\nbe found. The mean diameter is then the cube root of the product of the\r\nthree observed diameters. The middle diameter is usually about equal\r\nto the mean diameter, and can generally be used for it, avoiding the\r\ntroublesome measurement of the short diameters.\r\n\r\nThe sizes of the separations of the sieves are always determined from\r\nthe very last sand which passes through in the course of an analysis,\r\nand the results so obtained are quite accurate. With the elutriations\r\naverage samples are inspected, and estimates made of the range in\r\nsize of particles in each portion. Some stray particles both above\r\nand below the normal sizes are usually present, and even with the\r\ngreatest care the result is only an approximation to the truth; still,\r\na series of results made in strictly the same way should be thoroughly\r\nsatisfactory, notwithstanding possible moderate errors in the absolute\r\nsizes.\r\n\r\n=Calculation of Results.=—When a material has been separated into\r\nportions, each of which is accurately weighed, and the range in the\r\nsizes of grains in each portion determined, the weight of the particles\r\nfiner than each size of separation can be calculated, and with enough\r\nproperly selected separations the results can be plotted in the form of\r\na diagram, and measurements of the curve taken for intermediate points\r\nwith a fair degree of accuracy. This curve of results may be drawn upon\r\na uniform scale, using the actual figures of sizes and of per cents by\r\nweight, or the logarithms of the figures may be used in one or both\r\ndirections. The method of plotting is not of vital importance, and\r\nthe method for any set of materials which gives the most easily and\r\naccurately drawn curves is to be preferred. In the diagram published\r\nin the Report of the Mass. State Board of Health for 1891, page 430,\r\nthe logarithmic scale was used in one direction, but in many instances\r\nthe logarithmic scale can be used to advantage in both directions. With\r\nthis method it has been found that the curve is often almost a straight\r\nline through the lower and most important section, and very accurate\r\nresults are obtained even with a smaller number of separations.\r\n\r\n=Examples of Calculation of Results.=—Following are examples of\r\nrepresentative analyses, showing the method of calculation used with\r\nthe different methods of separation employed with various materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

By plotting these figures we\r\nfind that 10 per cent of the stones are less than 35 millimeters in\r\ndiameter, and 60 per cent are less than 51 millimeters. The “uniformity\r\ncoefficient,” as described below, is the ratios of these numbers, or\r\n1.46, while the “effective size” is 35 millimeters.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ANALYSIS OF A SAND BY MEANS OF SIEVES.\r\n\r\nA portion of the sample was dried in a porcelain dish in an air-bath.\r\nWeight dry, 110.9 grams. It was put into a series of sieves in a\r\nmechanical shaker, and given one hundred turns (equal to about seven\r\nhundred single shakes). The sieves were then taken apart, and the\r\nportion passing the finest sieve weighed. After noting the weight, the\r\nsand remaining on the finest sieve, but passing all the coarser sieves,\r\nwas added to the first and again weighed, this process being repeated\r\nuntil all the sample was upon the scale, weighing 110.7 grams, showing\r\na loss by handling of only 0.2 gram. The figures were as follows:\r\n\r\n  -------+------------+--------+---------\r\n         |  Size of   |        |\r\n         | Separation |Quantity|Per Cent\r\n  Sieve  |  of this   | of Sand|   of\r\n  Marked.|   Sieve.   |Passing.|  Total\r\n         |Millimeters.|Grams.  | Weight.\r\n  -------+------------+--------+---------\r\n    190  |   =.105=   |    .5  |    =.5=\r\n    140  |   =.135=   |   1.3  |   =1.2=\r\n    100  |   =.182=   |   4.1  |   =3.7=\r\n     60  |   =.320=   |  23.2  |  =21.0=\r\n     40  |   =.46=    |  56.7  |  =51.2=\r\n     20  |   =.93=    |  89.1  |  =80.5=\r\n     10  |  =2.04=    | 104.6  |  =94.3=\r\n      6  |  =3.90=    | 110.7  | =100.0=\r\n  -------+------------+--------+--------\r\n\r\nPlotting the figures in heavy-faced type, we find from the curve that\r\n10 and 60 per cent respectively are finer than .25 and .62 millimeter,\r\nand we have for effective size, as described above, .25, and for\r\nuniformity coefficient 2.5.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ANALYSIS OF A FINE MATERIAL WITH ELUTRIATION.\r\n\r\nThe entire sample, 74 grams, was taken for analysis. The sieves used\r\nwere not the same as those in the previous analysis, and instead of\r\nmixing the various portions on the scale they were separately weighed.\r\nThe siftings were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Remaining on sieve marked  10, above 2.2  millimeters  1.5 grams\r\n  Remaining on sieve marked  20, above  .98 millimeters  7.0 grams\r\n  Remaining on sieve marked  40, above  .46 millimeters 22.0 grams\r\n  Remaining on sieve marked  70, above  .24 millimeters 20.2 grams\r\n  Remaining on sieve marked 140, above  .13 millimeters  9.2 grams\r\n  Passing sieve             140, below  .13 millimeters 14.1 grams\r\n\r\nThe 14.1 grams passing the 140 sieve were thoroughly mixed, and one\r\nthird, 4.7 grams, taken for analysis. After ignition just below a red\r\nheat in a radiator, the weight was diminished by 0.47 gram. The portion\r\nabove .08 millimeter and between .04 and .08 millimeter, separated as\r\ndescribed above, weighed respectively 1.27 and 1.71 grams, and the\r\nportion below .04 millimeter was estimated by difference [4.7 - (0.47\r\n+ 1.27 + 1.71)] to be 1.25 grams. Multiplying these quantities by 3,\r\nwe obtain the corresponding quantities for the entire sample, and the\r\ncalculation of quantities finer than the various sizes can be made as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  -----------------------+-------+------------+-------------+-----------\r\n                         |       |  Size of   |Weight of all|Per Cent by\r\n                         |Weight.|  Largest   |  the Finer  | Weight of\r\n      Size of Grain.     | Grams.| Particles. |  Particles. | all Finer\r\n                         |       |Millimeters.|    Grams.   | Particles.\r\n  -----------------------+-------+------------+-------------+-----------\r\n  Above 2.20 millimeters |  1.50 |    ....    |    74.00    |   =100=\r\n    .98-2.20 millimeters |  7.00 |   =2.20=   |    72.50    |    =98=\r\n    .46- .98 millimeters | 22.00 |    =.98=   |    65.50    |    =89=\r\n    .24- .46 millimeters | 20.20 |    =.46=   |    43.50    |    =60=\r\n    .13- .24 millimeters |  9.20 |    =.24=   |    23.30    |    =32=\r\n    .08- .13 millimeters |  3.81 |    =.13=   |    14.10    |    =19=\r\n    .04- .08 millimeters |  5.13 |    =.08=   |    10.29    |    =14=\r\n    .01- .04 millimeters |  3.75 |    =.04=   |     5.16    |     =7=\r\n  Loss on ignition       |       |            |             |\r\n     (assumed to be less |       |            |             |\r\n     than .01 millimeter)|  1.41 |    =.01=   |     1.41    |     =1.9=\r\n  -----------------------+-------+------------+-------------+-----------\r\n\r\nBy plotting the heavy-faced figures we find that 10 and 60 per cent are\r\nrespectively finer than .055 and .46 millimeter, and we have effective\r\nsize .055 millimeter and uniformity coefficient 8.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe effective size and uniformity coefficient calculated in this way\r\nhave proved to be most useful in various calculations, particularly\r\nin estimating the friction between the sands and gravels and water.\r\nThe remainder of the article in the Report of the Mass. State Board\r\nof Health is devoted to a discussion of these relations which were\r\nmentioned in Chapter III of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IV.\r\n\r\nFILTER STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS OF OPERATION OF SAND FILTERS.\r\n\r\n  ------------+----------+---------+-------+-------+---------+-------+----------\r\n              |          |Total    |       |  Area | Average |Area of|Period,\r\n              |          |Quantity |       |   of  |  Daily  |Filter |\r\n              |          |of Water |       |Filters|  Yield, |Surface|Million\r\n              |          |filtered |Million|in use,|         |cleaned|Gallons\r\n  Place.      |  Year    |  for    |Gallons|       | Million |in One |per Acre\r\n              | Ending.  |One Year.| Daily.| Acres.| Gallons | Year, |filtered\r\n              |          | Million |       |       |per Acre.|       |between\r\n              |          | Gallons.|       |       |         |Acres. |Scrapings.\r\n  ------------+----------+---------+-------+-------+---------+-------+----------\r\n  Altona      |Mar., 1895|  1,620  |  4.44 |  3.08 |  1.45   | 31.0  |  52\r\n              |Mar., 1896|  1,730  |  4.75 |  3.08 |  1.55   | 48.5  |  36\r\n              |Mar., 1897|  1,960  |  5.40 |  3.08 |  1.75   | 44.0  |  45\r\n              |Mar., 1898|  1,940  |  5.30 |  3.08 |  1.72   | 36.5  |  53\r\n  Amsterdam,  |Dec., 1894|  1,390  |  3.80 |  5.43 |  0.71   | 23    |  62\r\n    River     |Dec., 1896|  1,490  |  4.08 |  5.43 |  0.75   | 48    |  31\r\n              |Dec., 1897|  1,600  |  4.40 |  5.43 |  0.81   | 30    |  53\r\n  Amsterdam,  |Dec., 1894|  2,330  |  6.40 |  4.94 |  1.29   |116    |  20\r\n    Dunes     |Dec., 1896|  2,360  |  6.50 |  4.75 |  1.37   | 90    |  26\r\n              |Dec., 1897|  2,290  |  6.25 |  4.75 |  1.31   |109    |  21\r\n  Ashland,    |Feb., 1897|    398  |  1.09 |  0.50 |  2.18   |  4.83 |  83\r\n    Wis.      |          |         |       |       |         |       |\r\n  Berlin,     |Mar., 1896| 13,000  | 35.60 | 25.10 |  1.42   |       |\r\n    total     |Mar., 1897| 12,900  | 35.40 | 25.10 |  1.40   |       |\r\n              |Mar., 1898| 13,200  | 36.20 | 27.00 |  1.34   |       |\r\n  Bremen      |Mar., 1895|  1,190  |  3.27 |  2.51 |  1.31   | 50    |  24\r\n              |Mar., 1896|  1,220  |  3.34 |  3.21 |  1.04   | 32.5  |  38\r\n              |Mar., 1897|  1,280  |  3.50 |  3.21 |  1.09   | 25.2  |  50\r\n              |Mar., 1898|  1,400  |  4.10 |  3.21 |  1.28   | 34.0  |  41\r\n  Breslau     |Mar., 1895|  2,840  |  7.80 |  5.12 |  1.52   | 45    |  64\r\n              |Mar., 1896|  2,960  |  8.10 |  5.12 |  1.58   | 40.0  |  74\r\n              |Mar., 1897|  2,990  |  8.20 |  5.12 |  1.60   | 37    |  81\r\n              |Mar., 1898|  3,060  |  8.40 |  5.12 |  1.64   | 43    |  71\r\n  Brunn       |Dec., 1896|  1,110  |  3.04 |  1.62 |  1.87   |  8.6  | 128\r\n              |Dec., 1897|  1,190  |  3.25 |  1.62 |  2.00   |  9.1  | 131\r\n  Brunswick   |Mar., 1895|    815  |  2.23 |  1.48 |  1.51   | 14.8  |  55\r\n              |Mar., 1896|    840  |  2.30 |  1.48 |  1.56   | 13.3  |  63\r\n              |Mar., 1897|    820  |  2.25 |  1.48 |  1.52   | 13.7  |  60\r\n              |Mar., 1898|    870  |  2.38 |  1.48 |  1.61   | 11.9  |  73\r\n  Budapest    |Dec., 1892|  7,360  | 20.20 |  3.00 |  6.70   |254    |  29\r\n  Copenhagen  |Dec., 1895|  2,330  |  6.40 |  2.88 |  2.22   | 45    |  52\r\n              |Dec., 1896|  2,490  |  6.80 |  2.88 |  2.35   | 52    |  48\r\n              |Dec., 1897|  2,580  |  7.10 |  2.88 |  2.47   | 54    |  48\r\n  Dordrecht   |Dec., 1894|    365  |  1.00 |  0.56 |  1.79   |       |\r\n  Frankfort   |Dec., 1895|    310  |  0.85 |  0.37 |  2.28   |  2.9  | 107\r\n    on Oder   |Dec., 1896|    325  |  0.89 |  0.37 |  2.40   |  7.4  |  44\r\n              |Dec., 1897|    356  |  0.98 |  0.37 |  2.65   |  8.8  |  41\r\n  Hamburg     |Dec., 1894| 11,450  | 31.40 | 34.0  |  0.92   |350    |  33\r\n              |Dec., 1895| 11,700  | 32.10 | 34.0  |  0.94   |275    |  43\r\n              |Dec., 1896| 11,500  | 31.70 | 34.0  |  0.93   |266    |  43\r\n              |Dec., 1897| 12,000  | 32.70 | 34.0  |  0.96   |285    |  42\r\n              |Dec., 1898| 11,900  | 32.60 | 43.0  |  0.76   |246    |  48\r\n  Hudson,     |Dec., 1892|    697  |  1.91 |  0.74 |  2.58   |       |\r\n    N.

Kirkwood, built in 1872, was\r\nthe earliest of its kind in the United States. It was enlarged by the\r\nSuperintendent, Charles E. Fowler, in 1896. The walls of the original\r\nfilters were of rubble, and in course of time developed cracks and\r\nleaked badly. The walls of the new filter are of rubble, faced with\r\nvitrified brick. The filters treat the water of the Hudson River, which\r\nis sewage-polluted and more or less muddy. Description: Jour. N. E.\r\nWater Works Assoc., Vol. 12, p. 209.\r\n\r\nHUDSON, N. Y. Designed by James P. Kirkwood, built in 1874. enlarged in\r\n1888. The filters are open and are used for treating the Hudson River\r\nwater, which is sewage-polluted and more or less muddy. Description:\r\nEng. News, Vol. 31, p. 487.\r\n\r\nST. JOHNSBURY, VT. (E. & T. Fairbanks & Co.) These filters were built\r\nabout 30 years ago, and have been recently enlarged. The filters were\r\noriginally open, but were afterwards covered with a roof. The single\r\nroof proved inadequate to keep them from freezing, and a second roof\r\nwas added inside and under the main roof. They are used for filtering\r\npond water, which is quite clear and not subject to much pollution. The\r\nwater supply is one of two, the other is the town supply and is taken\r\nfrom the Passumpsic River. No published description.\r\n\r\nNANTUCKET, MASS. Designed by J. B. Rider, built in 1892. This filter\r\nis used to remove organisms from the reservoir water supply. It is\r\nonly used when the organisms are troublesome, and is satisfactory in\r\npreventing the tastes and odors which formerly resulted from their\r\npresence. Description: Jour. N. E. Water Works Assoc., Vol. 8, p. 171;\r\nEng. News, Vol. 31, p. 336.\r\n\r\nLAWRENCE, MASS. Designed by Hiram F. Mills, built in 1892-3, and put\r\nin operation September, 1893. It is used for treating the water of the\r\nMerrimac River, which contains a large amount of sewage. Description:\r\nReport of the Mass. State Board of Health, 1893, p. 543; Jour. N. E.\r\nWater Works Assoc., Vol. 9, p. 44; Eng. News, Vol. 30, p. 97.\r\n\r\nILION, N. Y. Designed by the Stanwix Engineering Company and are used\r\nfor treating reservoir water, which is generally clear and not subject\r\nto pollution. Description: Eng. News, Vol. 31, p. 466.\r\n\r\nMOUNT VERNON, N. Y. (New York Suburban Water Company.) Designed by\r\nJ. N. Chester, built in 1894. These filters are similar in general\r\nconstruction to the Lawrence filter, although the dimensions both\r\nvertical and horizontal are reduced, and the area is divided into three\r\nparts. The filters are used for treating reservoir water, which is\r\ngenerally quite clear, but which is polluted by a considerable amount\r\nof sewage. Since the use of filters the reduction in the typhoid fever\r\ndeath-rate has been very great. Description: Eng. News, Vol. 32, p. 155.\r\n\r\nMILFORD, MASS. Designed by F. L. Northrop. This filter is very simple\r\nin construction, and is used for filtering Charles River water as an\r\nauxiliary supply. Description: Jour. N. E. Water Works Assoc., Vol. 10,\r\np. 262.\r\n\r\nGRAND FORKS, N. D. Designed by W. S. Russell. These filters are covered\r\nwith roofs. They treat the water from the Red River, which is very\r\nmuddy, and also sewage-polluted, and which formerly caused typhoid\r\nfever. Description: Eng. News, Vol. 33, p. 341.\r\n\r\nASHLAND, WIS. Designed by William Wheeler, built in 1895. The Ashland\r\nfilters were the first vaulted masonry filters to be constructed in\r\nthe United States, and are used for treating the bay water, which\r\nis polluted with sewage, and is at times muddy from the river water\r\ndischarging into the bay near the intake. The filters are below the bay\r\nlevel, and receive water from it by gravity. Description: Jour. N. E.\r\nWater Works Assoc., Vol. 11, p. 301; Eng. News, Vol. 38, p. 338.\r\n\r\nLAMBERTVILLE, N. J.

In the United States, including Wilmington, the\r\ntotal filtering capacity is nearly 300 million gallons daily, of which\r\n18 per cent is represented by sand filters, 79 per cent by mechanical\r\nfilters, and 3 per cent by a special type of filters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX V.\r\n\r\nLONDON’S WATER-SUPPLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon alone among great capitals is supplied with water by private\r\ncompanies. They are, however, under government supervision, and\r\nthe rates charged for water are regulated by law. There are eight\r\ncompanies, each of which supplies its own separate district, so that\r\nthere is no competition whatever. One of the companies supplying\r\n460,000 people uses only ground-water drawn from deep wells in the\r\nchalk, but the other seven companies depend mainly upon the rivers\r\nThames and Lea for their water. All water so drawn is filtered, and\r\nmust be satisfactory to the water examiner, who is required to inspect\r\nthe water supplied by each company at frequent intervals, and the\r\nresults of the examinations are published each month.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 the average daily supply was 235,000,000 gallons, of which\r\nabout 40,000,000 were drawn from the chalk, 125,000,000 from the\r\nThames, and 70,000,000 from the Lea. Formerly some of the water\r\ncompanies drew water from the Thames within the city where it was\r\ngrossly polluted, and the plagues and cholera which formerly ravaged\r\nLondon were in part due to this fact. These intakes were abandoned\r\nmany years ago, and all the companies now draw their water from points\r\noutside of the city and its immediate suburbs.\r\n\r\nThe area of the watershed of the Thames above the intakes of the water\r\ncompanies is 3548 square miles, and the population living upon it in\r\n1891 was 1,056,415. The Thames Conservancy Board has control of the\r\nmain river for its whole length, and of all tributaries within ten\r\nmiles in a straight line of the main river, but has no jurisdiction\r\nover the more remote feeders. The area drained is essentially\r\nagricultural, with but little manufacturing, and there are but few\r\nlarge towns. In the area coming under the conservators there are but\r\nsix towns with populations above 10,000 and an aggregate population\r\nof 170,000, and there are but two or three other large towns on the\r\nremaining area more than ten miles from the river. These principal\r\ntowns are as follows:\r\n\r\n     Town.     Population 1891.  Distance above\r\n                                 Water Intakes.\r\n  Reading           60,054          49 miles\r\n  Oxford            45,791          87 miles\r\n  New Swindon       27,295         116 miles\r\n  High Wycomb       13,435          33 miles\r\n  Windsor           12,327          18 miles\r\n  Maidenhead        10,607          25 miles\r\n  Guildford         14,319          20 miles\r\n\r\nGuildford is outside of the conservators’ area. All of the above towns\r\ntreat their sewage by irrigation.\r\n\r\nAmong the places that are regarded as the most dangerous are Chertsey\r\nand Staines, with populations of 9215 and 5060, only 8 and 11 miles\r\nabove the intakes respectively. These towns are only partially sewered\r\nand still depend mainly on cesspools. An attempt is made to treat the\r\nlittle sewage which they produce upon land, but the work has not as yet\r\nbeen systematically carried out. There are also several small towns of\r\n3000 inhabitants or less upon the upper river which do not treat their\r\nsewage so far as they have any, but, owing to their great distance,\r\nthe danger from them is much less than from Chertsey and Staines.\r\nTwenty-one of the principal towns upon the watershed have sewage farms,\r\nand there are no chemical precipitation plants now in use.\r\n\r\nBoats upon the river are not allowed to drain into it, but are\r\ncompelled to provide receptacles for their sewage, and facilities\r\nare provided for removing and disposing of it; and as an additional\r\nprecaution no boat is allowed to anchor within five miles of the\r\nintakes.\r\n\r\nThe conservators of the river Lea have control of its entire drainage\r\narea, which is about 460 square miles, measured from the East London\r\nwater intakes, and has a population of 189,287. On this watershed there\r\nis but a single town with more than 10,000 inhabitants, this being\r\nLutton near the headwaters of the river, with a population of 30,005.\r\nThe sewage from Lutton and from seventeen smaller places is treated\r\nupon land. No crude sewage is known to be ordinarily discharged into\r\nthe river. At Hereford, eleven miles above the East London intakes,\r\nthere is a chemical precipitation plant. The conservators do not\r\nregard this treatment as satisfactory, and have recently conducted\r\nan expensive lawsuit against the local authorities to compel them to\r\nfurther treat their effluent. The suit was lost, the court holding that\r\nno actual injury to health had been shown. It is especially interesting\r\nto note that of the thirty-nine places on the Thames and the Lea giving\r\ntheir sewage systematic treatment there is but a single place using\r\nchemical precipitation, and there it is not considered satisfactory.\r\nFormerly quite a number of these towns used other processes than land\r\ntreatment, but in every case but Hereford land treatment has been\r\nsubstituted.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the efficiency of the sewage farms, it is believed that\r\nin ordinary weather the whole of the sewage percolates through the\r\nland, and the inspectors of the Conservancy Boards strongly object to\r\nits being allowed to pass over the surface into the streams. The land,\r\nhowever, is for the most part impervious, as compared to Massachusetts\r\nand German sewage farms, and in times of heavy storms the land often\r\nhas all the water it can take without receiving even the ordinary flow\r\nof sewage, and much less the increased storm-flow. At such times the\r\nsewage either does go over the surface, or perhaps more frequently\r\nis discharged directly into the rivers without even a pretence of\r\ntreatment. The conservators apparently regard this as an unavoidable\r\nevil and do not vigorously oppose it. It is the theory that, owing\r\nto the increased dilution with the storm-flows, the matter is\r\ncomparatively harmless, although it would seem that the reduced time\r\nrequired for it to reach the water-works intakes might largely offset\r\nthe effect of increased dilution.\r\n\r\nThe water companies have large storage and sedimentation basins with\r\nan aggregate capacity equal to nine days’ supply, but the proportion\r\nvaries widely with the different companies. It is desired that the\r\nwater held in reserve shall be alone used while the river is in flood,\r\nas, owing to its increased pollution, it is regarded as far more\r\ndangerous than the water at other times; but as no record is kept of\r\nthe times when raw sewage is discharged, and no exact information is\r\navailable in regard to the times when the companies do not take in\r\nraw water, it can safely be assumed that a considerable amount of raw\r\nsewage does become mixed with the water which is drawn by the companies.\r\n\r\nThe water drawn from the river is filtered through 113 filters having\r\nan area of 116 acres. None of the filters are covered, and with an\r\naverage January temperature of 39° but little trouble with ice is\r\nexperienced. A few new filters are provided with appliances for\r\nregulating the rate on each filter separately and securing regular and\r\ndetermined rates of filtration, but nearly all of the filters are of\r\nthe simple type described on page 48, and the rates of filtration are\r\nsubject to more or less violent fluctuation, the extent of which cannot\r\nbe determined.\r\n\r\nThe area of filters is being continually increased to meet increasing\r\nconsumption; the approximate areas of filters in use having been as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  1839  First filters built\r\n  1855   37 acres\r\n  1866   47 acres\r\n  1876   77 acres\r\n  1886  104 acres\r\n  1894  116 acres\r\n\r\nThere has been a tendency to reduce somewhat the rate of filtration. In\r\n1868, with 51 acres of filters, the average daily quantity of water\r\nfiltered was 111,000,000 gallons, or 2,180,000 gallons per acre. In\r\n1884, with 97 acres of filter surface, the daily quantity filtered was\r\n157,000,000 gallons, or 1,620,000 gallons per acre; and in 1893, with\r\n116 acres of filter surface and 195,000,000 gallons daily, the yield\r\nper acre was 1,680,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nOwing to the area of filter surface out of use while being cleaned,\r\nthe variations in consumption of water, and the imperfections of the\r\nregulating apparatus, the actual rates of filtration are often very\r\nmuch higher and at times may easily be double the figures given.\r\n\r\nEvidence regarding the healthfulness of the filtered river-water was\r\ncollected and examined in a most exhaustive manner in 1893 by a Royal\r\nCommission appointed to consider the water-supply of the metropolis in\r\nall its aspects with reference to future needs. This commission was\r\nunable to obtain any evidence whatever that the water as then supplied\r\nwas unhealthy or likely to become so, and they report that the rivers\r\ncan safely be depended upon for many years to come.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of deaths from all causes and from typhoid fever annually\r\nper million of inhabitants for the years 1885-1891 in the populations\r\nreceiving their waters from different sources in London were as follows:\r\n\r\n         Water used.          Deaths from   Deaths from\r\n                              All Causes.  Typhoid Fever.\r\n  Filtered Thames water only    19,501          125\r\n  Filtered Lea water only       21,334          167\r\n  Kent wells only               18,001          123\r\n  Thames and Lea jointly        18,945          138\r\n  Thames and Kent jointly       18,577          133\r\n\r\nThe population supplied exclusively from the Lea by the East London\r\nCompany is of a poorer class than that of the rest of London, and this\r\nmay account for the slightly higher death-rate in this section. Aside\r\nfrom this the rate is remarkably uniform and shows no great difference\r\nbetween the section drinking ground-water only and those drinking\r\nfiltered river-waters. The death-rate from typhoid fever is also very\r\nuniform and, although higher than that of some Continental cities with\r\nexcellent water-supplies (Berlin, Vienna, Munich, Dresden), is very\r\nlow—lower than in any American city of which I have records.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, it was shown by the Registrar-General that there\r\nis only a very small amount of typhoid fever on the watersheds of\r\nthe Thames and Lea, so that the danger of infection of the water as\r\ndistinct from pollution is less than would otherwise be the case. Thus\r\nfor the seven years above mentioned the numbers of deaths from typhoid\r\nfever per million of population were only 105 and 120 on the watersheds\r\nof the Thames and the Lea respectively, as against 176 for the whole of\r\nEngland and Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON FILTERS, 1896.\r\n\r\nTwenty-sixth Annual Report of the Local Government Board, pages 206-213.\r\n\r\n  --------------+-------+---------+-----------------+--------------------------\r\n                |Amount |Average  |  Average Rate   |  Bacterial Efficiency.\r\n                |  of   |Thickness| of Filtration.  |\r\n                |Storage|   of    +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n                |  Raw  |  Sand,  |Imperial|Millions|Maximum.|Minimum.|Average.\r\n     Company.   |Water, |  Feet.  |Gallons | U.

The water\r\nwas always filtered, and the original filters remained in use until\r\n1893, when they were supplanted by the new works at Lake Müggel. Soon\r\nafter acquiring the works the city introduced water from wells by Lake\r\nTegel as a supplementary supply, but much trouble was experienced from\r\ncrenothrix, an organism growing in ground-waters containing iron, and\r\nin 1883 this supply was replaced by filtered water from Lake Tegel.\r\nWith rapidly-increasing pollution of the Spree at Stralau the purity\r\nof this source was questioned, and in 1893 it was abandoned (although\r\nstill held as a reserve in case of urgent necessity), the supply now\r\nbeing taken from the river ten miles higher up, at Müggel.\r\n\r\nThe watershed of the Spree above Stralau, as I found by map\r\nmeasurement, is about 3800 square miles; the average rainfall is about\r\n25 inches yearly. At extreme low water the river discharges 457 cubic\r\nfeet per second, or 295 million gallons daily, and when in flood 5700\r\ncubic feet per second may be discharged. The city is allowed by law to\r\ntake 46 million gallons daily for water-supply, and this quantity can\r\nbe drawn either at Stralau or at Müggel.\r\n\r\nAbove Stralau the river is polluted by numerous manufactories and\r\nwashing establishments, and by the effluent from a considerable part\r\nof the city’s extensive sewage farms. The shipping on this part of the\r\nriver also is heavy, and sewage from the boats is discharged directly\r\ninto the river. The average number of bacteria in the Spree at this\r\npoint is something over ten thousand per cubic centimeter, and 99.6 per\r\ncent of them were removed by the filters in 1893.\r\n\r\nThe watershed of the Spree above the new water-works at Müggel I found\r\nby map measurement to be 2800 square miles, and the low water-discharge\r\nis said to be 269 million gallons daily. The river at this point flows\r\nthrough Lake Müggel, which forms a natural sedimentation-basin, and the\r\nraw water is quite clear except in windy weather.\r\n\r\nThere were 16 towns on the watershed with populations above 2000 each\r\nin 1890, and an aggregate population of 132,000, which does not include\r\nthe population of the smaller places or country districts. None of\r\nthese places purify their sewage so far as they have any. Fürstenwalde\r\nwith a population of 12,935, and 22 miles above Müggel, has surface\r\nsewers discharging directly into the river. Above Fürstenwalde the\r\nriver runs through numerous lakes which probably remove the effect\r\nof the pollution from the more distant cities. There is considerable\r\nshipping on the river for some miles above Fürstenwalde (which forms a\r\nsection of the Friedrich Wilhelm Canal), but hardly any between Müggel\r\nand Fürstenwalde. The raw water at Müggel contains two or three hundred\r\nbacteria per cubic centimeter, and is thus a comparatively pure water\r\nbefore filtration. It is slightly peaty and the filtered water has a\r\nlight straw color.\r\n\r\nLake Tegel, which supplies the other part of the city’s supply, is an\r\nenlargement of the river Havel. The watershed above Tegel I find to be\r\nabout 1350 square miles, and the annual rainfall is about 22 inches.\r\nThe low water-discharge is said to be 182 million gallons daily, and\r\nthe city is allowed by law to take 23 million gallons for water-supply.\r\n\r\nThere were ten towns upon the watershed with populations above 2000\r\neach in 1890, and with an aggregate population of 44,000. Of these\r\nTegel is directly upon the lake with a population of 3000, and\r\nOranienburg, 14 miles above, has a population of 6000 and is rapidly\r\nincreasing. The shipping on the lake and river is heavy. The lake water\r\nordinarily contains two or three hundred bacteria per cubic centimeter.\r\nThe lake is shallow and becomes turbid in windy weather.\r\n\r\nThere are 21 filter-beds at Tegel with a combined area of 12.40 acres\r\nto furnish a maximum of 23 million gallons of water daily, and 22\r\nfilters at Müggel with a combined area of 12.7 acres to deliver the\r\nsame quantity. Twenty-two more filters will be built at Müggel within\r\na few years to purify the full quantity which can be taken from the\r\nriver. All of these filters are covered with brick arches supported by\r\npillars about 16 feet apart from centre to centre in each direction,\r\nand the whole is covered by nearly 3 feet of earth, making them quite\r\nfrost-proof. The original filters at Stralau were open, but much\r\ndifficulty was experienced with them in winter.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the filters at Tegel consists of 8 inches of concrete\r\nabove 20 inches of packed clay and with 2 inches of cement above, and\r\nslopes slightly from each side to the centre. The central drain goes\r\nthe whole length of the filters and has a uniform cross-section of\r\nabout 1/7300 of the area of the whole bed. There are no lateral drains,\r\nbut the water is brought to the central drain by a twelve-inch layer\r\nof stones as large as a man’s fist; above this there is another foot\r\nof gravel of graded sizes supporting two feet of fine sand, which is\r\nreduced by scraping to half its thickness before the sand is replaced.\r\nThe average depth of water above the sand is nearly 5 feet. The filters\r\nare not allowed to filter at a rate above 2.57 million gallons per\r\nacre daily, and at this rate with 70 per cent of the area in service\r\nthe whole legal quantity of water can be filtered. The filters work\r\nat precisely the same rate day and night, and the filtered water\r\nis continuously pumped as filtered to ample storage reservoirs at\r\nCharlottenburg. The pumps which lift the water from the lake to the\r\nfilters work against a head of 14 feet. The apparatus for regulating\r\nthe rate of filtration was described on page 51.\r\n\r\nAs yet no full description of the Müggel works has been published, but\r\nthey resemble closely the Tegel works. Both were designed by or under\r\nthe direction of the late director of the water-works, Mr. Henry Gill.\r\n\r\nThe average daily quantity of water supplied for the fiscal year ending\r\nMarch 31, 1893, was 29,000,000 gallons daily, which estimate allows\r\n10 percent for the slip of the pumps. Of this quantity 9,650,000 was\r\nfurnished by Stralau and 19,350,000 by Tegel. The greatest consumption\r\nin a single day was 43,300,000 gallons, or 26.6 gallons per head,\r\nwhile the average quantity for the year was 18.4 gallons per head. All\r\nwater without exception is sold by meter, the prices ranging from 27.2\r\ncents a thousand gallons for small consumers to 13.6 cents for large\r\nconsumers and manufacturers. The average receipts for all water pumped,\r\nincluding that used for public purposes and not paid for, were 15.4\r\ncents a thousand gallons, against the cost of production, 9.8 cents,\r\nwhich covers operating expenses, interest on capital, and provision for\r\nsinking fund. This leaves a handsome net profit to the city. On account\r\nof the comparatively high price of the city water and the ease with\r\nwhich well-water is obtained, the latter is almost exclusively used\r\nfor running engines, manufacturing purposes, etc., and this in part\r\nexplains the very low per-capita consumption.\r\n\r\nThe volume of sewage, however, for the same year, including rain-water,\r\nexcept during heavy showers, was only 29 gallons per head, showing even\r\nwith the private water-supplies an extraordinarily low consumption.\r\n\r\nThe friction of the water in the 4.75 miles of 3-foot pipe between\r\nTegel and the reservoir at Charlottenburg presents an interesting\r\npoint. When well-water with crenothrix was pumped, the friction rose\r\nto 34.5 feet, when the velocity was 2.46 feet per second. According to\r\nHerr Anklamm, who had charge of the works at the time, the friction was\r\nreduced to 19.7 feet when filtered water was used and after the pipe\r\nhad been flushed, and this has not increased with continued use. He\r\ncalculated the friction for the velocity according to Darcy 15.0 feet,\r\nLampe 17.8 feet, Weisbach 18.7 feet, and Prony 21.5 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VII.\r\n\r\nALTONA WATER-WORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Altona water-works are specially interesting as an example of\r\na water drawn from a source polluted to a most unusual extent: the\r\nsewage from cities with a population of 770,000, including its own, is\r\ndischarged into the river Elbe within ten miles above the intake and\r\nupon the same side.\r\n\r\nThe area of the watershed of the Elbe above Altona is about 52,000\r\nsquare miles, and the average rainfall is estimated to be about\r\n28 inches, varying from 24 or less near its mouth to much higher\r\nquantities in the mountains far to the south. On this watershed there\r\nare 46 cities, which in 1890 had populations of over 20,000 each,\r\nand in addition there is a permanent population upon the river-boats\r\nestimated at 20,000, making in all 5,894,000 inhabitants, without\r\nincluding either country districts or the numberless cities with less\r\nthan 20,000 inhabitants each. The sewage from about 1,700,000 of these\r\npeople is purified before being discharged; and assuming that as many\r\npeople living in cities smaller than 20,000 are connected with sewers\r\nas live in larger places without being so connected, the sewage of\r\nover four million people is discharged untreated into the Elbe and its\r\ntributaries.\r\n\r\nThe more important of these sources of pollution are the following:\r\n\r\n      City              Population  On what    Approximate\r\n                         in 1890.

Halle treats less than a\r\ntenth of its sewage. Magdeburg will treat its sewage in the course of\r\na few years. Leipzig, Chemnitz, and other places are thinking more or\r\nless seriously of purification.\r\n\r\nThe number of bacteria in the raw water at Altona fluctuates with the\r\ntide and is extremely variable; numbers of 50,000 and 100,000 are not\r\ninfrequent, but 10,000 to 40,000 is perhaps about the usual range.\r\n\r\nThe works were originally built by an English company in 1860, and have\r\nsince been greatly extended. They were bought by the city some years\r\nago. The water is pumped directly from the river to a settling-basin\r\nupon a hill 280 feet above the river. From this it flows by gravity\r\nthrough the filters to the slightly lower pure-water reservoir and\r\nto the city without further pumping. The filters are open, with\r\nnearly vertical masonry walls, as described in Kirkwood’s report. The\r\ncross-section of the main underdrain is 1/2800 of the area of the beds.\r\n\r\nConsiderable trouble has been experienced from frost. With continued\r\ncold weather it is extremely difficult to satisfactorily scrape the\r\nfilters, and very irregular rates of filtration may result at such\r\ntimes. In the last few years, with systematic bacterial investigation,\r\nit has been found that greatly decreased efficiency frequently follows\r\ncontinued cold weather, and the mild epidemics of typhoid fever\r\nfrom which the city has long suffered have generally occurred after\r\nthese times. Thus a light epidemic of typhoid in 1886 came in March,\r\nfollowing a light epidemic in Hamburg. In 1887 a severe epidemic in\r\nFebruary followed a severe epidemic in Hamburg in December and January.\r\nIn 1888 a severe epidemic in March followed an epidemic in Hamburg\r\nlasting from November to January. Hamburg’s epidemic of 1889, coming in\r\nwarm weather, September and October, was followed by only a very slight\r\nincrease in Altona. In 1891 Altona suffered again in February from a\r\nsevere epidemic, although very little typhoid had been in Hamburg. A\r\nless severe outbreak also came in February, 1892, and a still slighter\r\none in February, 1893. In the ten years 1882-1892, of five well-marked\r\nepidemics, three broke out in February and two in March, while two\r\nsmaller outbreaks came in December and January. No important outbreak\r\nhas ever occurred in summer or in the fall months, when typhoid\r\nis usually most prevalent, thus showing clearly the bad effect of\r\nfrost upon open filters (see Appendix II). With steadily increasing\r\nconsumption the sedimentation-basin capacity of late years has become\r\ninsufficient as well as the filtering area, and it is not unlikely that\r\nwith better conditions a much better result could be obtained in winter\r\neven with open filters.[63]\r\n\r\nThe brilliant achievement of the Altona filters was in the summer of\r\n1892, when they protected the city from the cholera which\r\n\r\nso ravaged Hamburg, although the raw water at Altona must have\r\ncontained a vastly greater quantity of infectious matter than that\r\nwhich worked such havoc in Hamburg.\r\n\r\nFrom these records it appears that for about nine months of the year\r\nthe Altona filters protect the city from the impurities of the Elbe\r\nwater, but that during cold weather, with continued mean temperatures\r\nbelow the freezing-point, such protection is not completely afforded,\r\nand bad effects have occasionally resulted. Notwithstanding the recent\r\nconstruction of open filters in Hamburg it appears to me that there\r\nmust always be more or less danger from open filters in such a climate.\r\nHamburg’s danger, however, will be much less than Altona’s on account\r\nof its better intake above the outlets of the sewers of Hamburg and\r\nAltona, which are the most important points of pollution at Altona.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VIII.\r\n\r\nHAMBURG WATER-WORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe source and quality of the water previously supplied has been\r\nsufficiently indicated in Appendix II. It was originally intended to\r\nfilter the water, but the construction of filters was postponed from\r\ntime to time until the fall of 1890, when the project was seriously\r\ntaken up, and work was commenced in the spring of 1891. Three years\r\nwere allowed for construction. In 1892, however, the epidemic of\r\ncholera came, killing 8605 residents and doing incalculable damage to\r\nthe business interests of the city. The health authorities found that\r\nthe principal cause of this epidemic was the polluted water-supply.\r\nTo prevent a possible recurrence of cholera in 1893, the work of\r\nconstruction of the filters was pressed forward much more rapidly than\r\nhad been intended. Electric lights were provided to allow the work to\r\nproceed nights as well as days, and as a result the plant was put in\r\noperation May 27, 1893, a full year before the intended time. Owing to\r\nthe forced construction the cost was materially increased.\r\n\r\nThe new works take the raw water from a point one and a half miles\r\nfarther up-stream, where it is believed the tide can never carry the\r\ncity’s own sewage, as it did frequently to the old intake. The water\r\nis pumped from the river to settling-basins against heads varying with\r\ntide and the water-level in the basins from 8 to 22 feet. Each of the\r\nfour settling-basins has an area of about 10 acres, and, with the water\r\n6.56 feet deep, holds 20,500,000 gallons, or 82,000,000 gallons in\r\nall. The works are intended to supply a maximum of 48,000,000 gallons\r\ndaily, but the present average consumption is only about 35,000,000\r\ngallons (1892), or 59 gallons per head for 600,000 population.\r\nThis consumption is regarded as excessive, and it is hoped that it\r\nwill be reduced materially by the more general use of meters. The\r\nsedimentation-basins are surrounded by earthen embankments with slopes\r\nof 1:3, the inner sides being paved with brick above a clay layer. The\r\nwater flows by gravity from these basins to the filters, a distance\r\nof 1-1/2 miles, through a conduit 8-1/2 feet in diameter. The flow of\r\nthe water out of the basins and from the lower end of the conduit is\r\nregulated by automatic gates connected with floats, shown by Fig. 11,\r\npage 60.\r\n\r\nThe filters are 18 in number, and each has an effective area of 1.89,\r\nor 34 acres in all. They are planned to filter at a rate of 1.60\r\nmillion gallons per acre daily, which with 16 filters in use gives a\r\ndaily quantity of 48,000,000 gallons as the present limit of the works.\r\nThe sides of the filters are embankments with 1:2 slopes. Both sides\r\nand bottoms have 20 inches of packed clay, above which are 4 inches of\r\npuddle, supporting a brick pavement laid in cement. The bricks are laid\r\nflat on the bottom, but edge-wise on the sides where they will come in\r\ncontact with ice.\r\n\r\nThe main effluent-drain has a cross-section for the whole length of\r\nthe filter of 4.73 square feet, or 1/17000 of the area of the filter;\r\nand even at the low rate of filtration proposed, the velocity in the\r\ndrain will reach 0.97 foot. The drain has brick sides, 1.80 feet\r\nhigh, covered with granite slabs. The lateral drains are all of brick\r\nwith numerous large openings for admission of water. They are not\r\nventilated, and I am unable to learn that any bad results follow this\r\nomission.\r\n\r\nThe filling of the filters consists of 2 feet of gravel, the top being\r\nof course finer than the bottom layers, above which are 40 inches of\r\nsand, which are to be reduced to 24 inches by scraping before being\r\nrefilled. The water over the sand, when the latter is of full depth,\r\nis 43 inches deep, and will be increased to 59 inches with the minimum\r\nsand-thickness. The apparatus for regulating the rate of filtration was\r\ndescribed page 52. The cost of the entire plant, including 34 acres\r\neffective filter-surface, 40 acres of sedimentation-basins, over 2\r\nmiles of 8-1/2-foot conduit, pumping-machinery, sand-washing apparatus,\r\nlaboratory, etc., was about 9,500,000 marks, or $2,280,000. This all\r\nreckoned on the effective filter area is $67,000 per acre, or $3.80 per\r\nhead for a population of 600,000.\r\n\r\nThe death-rate since the introduction of filtered water has been lower\r\nthan ever before in the history of the city, but as it is thought that\r\nother conditions may help to this result, no conclusions are as yet\r\ndrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATHS IN HAMBURG FROM ALL CAUSES, AND FROM TYPHOID FEVER, BEFORE AND\r\nAFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF FILTERS.\r\n\r\n  --------------------+-----------+-----------+--------------\r\n                      |Deaths from|Deaths from|\r\n                      |all Causes |  Typhoid  |\r\n         Year.        | per 1000  | Fever per |\r\n                      |  Living.  | 100,000   |\r\n                      |           |  Living.  |\r\n  --------------------+-----------+-----------+--------------\r\n  1880                |   24.9    |    26     |\r\n  1881                |   24.1    |    30     |\r\n  1882                |   23.7    |    27     |\r\n  1883                |   25.2    |    25     |\r\n  1884                |   25.1    |    26     |\r\n  1885                |   25.3    |    42     |\r\n  1886                |   29.0    |    71     |\r\n  1887                |   26.6    |    88     |\r\n  1888                |   24.5    |    54     |\r\n  1889                |   23.5    |    43     |\r\n  1890                |   22.0    |    27     |\r\n  1891                |   23.4    |    24     |\r\n  1892                |   41.1    |    34     |Cholera year.\r\n  1893                |   20.2    |    18     |Filtered water\r\n                      |           |           |  from May 28.\r\n  1894                |   17.9    |     7     |\r\n  1895                |   19.0    |    11     |\r\n  1896                |   17.3    |     6     |\r\n  1897                |   17.0    |     7     |\r\n  1898                |   17.5    |     5     |\r\n  Average for 5 years,|           |           |\r\n    excluding cholera |           |           |\r\n    year, before      |           |           |\r\n    filtration,       |           |           |\r\n    1887 to 1891      |   24.0    |    47.2   |\r\n  Average for 5 years |           |           |\r\n     with filtration, |           |           |\r\n     1894 to 1898     |   17.7    |     7.2   |\r\n  --------------------+-----------+-----------+--------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IX.\r\n\r\nNOTES ON SOME OTHER EUROPEAN WATER-SUPPLIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Amsterdam.=—The water is derived from open canals in the dunes. These\r\ncanals have an aggregate length of about 15 miles, and drain about 6200\r\nacres. The water, as it enters the canals from the fine dune-sand,\r\ncontains iron, but this is oxidized and deposited in the canals. The\r\nwater after collection is filtered. It has been suggested that by using\r\ncovered drains instead of open canals for collecting the water, the\r\nfiltration would be unnecessary; but, on the other hand, the cost of\r\nbuilding and maintaining covered drains in the very fine sand would be\r\nmuch greater than that of the canals, and it is believed, also, that\r\nthe water so collected would contain iron, the removal of which might\r\nprove as expensive as the present filtration. In 1887 filters were\r\nbuilt to take water from the river Vecht, but the city has refused to\r\nallow the English company which owns the water-works to sell this water\r\nfor domestic purposes, and it is only used for public and manufacturing\r\npurposes, only a fraction of the available supply being required.\r\nLeyden, the Hague, and some other Dutch cities have supplies like the\r\ndune supply of Amsterdam, and they are invariably filtered.\r\n\r\n=Antwerp= is also supplied by an English company. The raw water is\r\ndrawn from a small tidal river, which at times is polluted by the\r\nsewage of Brussels. It is treated by metallic iron in Anderson revolver\r\npurifiers, and is afterward filtered at a rather low average rate. The\r\nhygienic results are closely watched by the city authorities, and are\r\nsaid to be satisfactory.\r\n\r\n=Rotterdam.=—The raw water is drawn from the Maas, as the Dutch\r\ncall the main stream of the Rhine after it crosses their border. The\r\npopulation upon the river and its tributaries in Switzerland, Germany,\r\nHolland, France, and Belgium is very great; but the flow is also great,\r\nand the low water flow is exceptionally large in proportion to the\r\naverage flow, on account of the melting snow in summer in Switzerland,\r\nwhere it has its origin.\r\n\r\nThe original filters had wooden under-drains, and there was constant\r\ntrouble with crenothrix until the filters were reconstructed without\r\nwood, since which time there has been no farther trouble. The present\r\nfilters are large and well managed. There is ample preliminary\r\nsedimentation.\r\n\r\n=Schiedam.=—The filters at Schiedam are comparatively small, but are\r\nof unusual interest on account of the way in which they are operated.\r\nThe intake is from the Maas just below Rotterdam. The city was unable\r\nto raise the money to seek a more distant source of supply, and the\r\nengineer, H. P. N. Halbertsma, was unwilling to recommend a supply\r\nfrom so doubtful a source without more thorough treatment than simple\r\nsand-filtration was then thought to be. The plan adopted is to filter\r\nthe supply after preliminary sedimentation through two filters of 0.265\r\nacre each, and the resulting effluent is then passed through three\r\nother filters of the same size. River sand is used for the first, and\r\nthe very fine dune sand for the second filtration. The cost both of\r\nconstruction and operation was satisfactory to the city, and much below\r\nthat of any other available source; and the hygienic results have been\r\nequally satisfactory, notwithstanding the unfavorable position of the\r\nintake.\r\n\r\n=Magdeburg.=—The supply is drawn from the Elbe, and is filtered through\r\nvaulted filters after preliminary sedimentation. The pollution of\r\nthe river is considerable, although less than at Altona or even at\r\nHamburg. The city has been troubled at times by enormous discharges of\r\nsalt solution from salt-works farther up, which at extreme low water\r\nhave sometimes rendered the whole river brackish and unpleasant to the\r\ntaste; but arrangements have now been made which, it is hoped, will\r\nprevent the recurrence of this trouble.\r\n\r\n=Breslau= is supplied with filtered water from the river Oder,\r\nwhich has a watershed of 8200 square miles above the intake, and is\r\npolluted by the sewage from cities with an aggregate population of\r\nabout 200,000, some of which are in Galicia, where cholera is often\r\nprevalent. In recent years the city has been free from cholera, and\r\nfrom more than a very limited number of typhoid-fever cases; but the\r\npollution is so great as to cause some anxiety, notwithstanding the\r\nfavorable record of the filters, and there is talk of the desirability\r\nof securing another supply. Until 1893 there were four filter-beds,\r\nwith areas of 1.03 acres each, and not covered. In 1893 a fifth bed was\r\nadded. This is covered by vaulting and is divided into four sections,\r\nwhich are separately operated, so that it is really four beds of 0.25\r\nacre each. The vaulting is concrete arches, supported by steel I beams\r\nin one direction.\r\n\r\n=Budapest.=—A great variety of temporary water-supplies have at\r\ndifferent times been used by this rapidly growing city. The filters\r\nwhich for some years have supplied a portion of the supply have not\r\nbeen altogether satisfactory; but perhaps this was due to lack of\r\npreliminary sedimentation for the extremely turbid Danube water, and\r\nalso to inadequate filter-area. The city is rapidly building and\r\nextending works for a supply of ground-water, and in 1894 the filters\r\nwere only used as was necessary to supplement this supply, and it was\r\nhoped that enough well-water would be obtained to allow the filters to\r\nbe abandoned in the near future. The Danube above the intake receives\r\nthe sewage of Vienna and innumerable smaller cities, but the volume of\r\nthe river is very great compared to other European streams, so that the\r\nrelative pollution is not so great as in many other places.\r\n\r\n=Zürich.=—The raw water is drawn by the city from the Lake of Zürich\r\nnear its outlet, and but a few hundred feet from the heart of the city.\r\nAlthough no public sewers discharge into the lake, there is some\r\npollution from boats and bathers and other sources, and, judging by\r\nthe number of bacteria in the raw water, this pollution is increasing.\r\nThe raw water is extremely free from sediment, and the filters only\r\nbecome clogged very slowly. The rate of filtration is high, habitually\r\nreaching 7,000,000 gallons per acre daily; but, with the clear lake\r\nwater and long periods between scrapings, the results are excellent\r\neven at this rate. The filters are all covered with concrete groined\r\narches.\r\n\r\nFiltration was commenced in 1886, and was followed by a sharp decline\r\nin the amount of typhoid fever, which, up to that time, had been rather\r\nincreasing; for the six years before the change there were sixty-nine\r\ndeaths from this cause annually per 100,000 living, and for the six\r\nyears after only ten, or one seventh as many; and this reduction is\r\nattributed by the local authorities to the filtration.[64]\r\n\r\n=St. Petersburg.=—The supply is drawn from the Neva River by an English\r\ncompany, and is filtered through vaulted filters at a very high rate.\r\n\r\n=Warsaw.=—The supply is drawn from the Weichsel River by the city, and\r\nis filtered through vaulted filters after preliminary sedimentation at\r\na rate never exceeding 2,570,000 gallons per acre daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF UNFILTERED SURFACE-WATERS.\r\n\r\nThe use of surface-water without filtration in Europe is comparatively\r\nlimited. In Germany this use is now prohibited by the Imperial Board\r\nof Health. In Great Britain, Glasgow draws its supply unfiltered from\r\nLoch Katrine; and Manchester and some other towns use unfiltered\r\nwaters from lakes or impounding reservoirs the watersheds of which are\r\nentirely free from population. The best English practice, however, as\r\nin Germany, requires the filtration of such waters even if they are not\r\nknown to receive sewage, and the\r\n\r\nunpolluted supplies of Liverpool, Bradford, Dublin, and many other\r\ncities are filtered before use.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF GROUND-WATER.[65]\r\n\r\nGround-waters are extensively used in Europe, and apparently in\r\nsome localities the geological formations are unusually favorable\r\nto this kind of supply. Paris derives all the water it now uses for\r\ndomestic purposes from springs, but has a supplementary supply from\r\nthe river for other purposes. Vienna and Munich also obtain their\r\nentire supplies from springs, while Budapest, Cologne, Leipzig,\r\nDresden, Frankfurt, many of the great French cities, Brussels, a part\r\nof London, and many other English cities derive their supplies from\r\nwells or filter-galleries, and among the smaller cities all over Europe\r\nground-water supplies are more numerous than other kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX X.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE OF FILTRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of a number of articles on filtration.

Among such journals none gives more attention to filtration\r\nthan the _Journal für Gasbeleuchtung und Wasserversorgung_, which\r\npublishes regularly reports upon the operation of many German filters,\r\nand gives short notices of new construction. The first articles upon\r\nfiltration in this journal were a series of descriptions of German\r\nwater-works in 1870-73, including descriptions of filters at Altona,\r\nBrunswick, Lübeck, etc. Stenographic reports of many scientific\r\nmeetings have been published, particularly since 1890, and since 1892\r\nthere has been much discussion in regard to the “Rules for Filtration”\r\ngiven in Appendix I.\r\n\r\nA Report of a Royal Commission to inquire into the water-supply of the\r\nmetropolis, with minutes of evidence, appendices, and maps (London,\r\n1893-4), contains much valuable material in regard to filtration.\r\n\r\nThe monthly reports of the water examiner, and other papers published\r\nby the Local Government Board, London, are often of interest.\r\n\r\nThe German “Verein von Gas- u. Wasserfachmänner” prints without\r\npublishing a most useful annual summary of German water-works\r\nstatistics for distribution to members. Many of the statistics given in\r\nthis volume are from this source.\r\n\r\nDescription of the filters at Worms was given in the _Deutsche\r\nBauzeitung_, 1892, p. 508; of the filters at Liverpool in\r\n_Engineering_, 1889, p. 152, and 1892, p. 739. The latter journal also\r\nhas given a number of descriptions of filters built in various parts of\r\nthe world by English engineers, but, excepting the articles mentioned\r\nin the above list, the descriptions are not given in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE RECENT ARTICLES.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few of the more important articles which have\r\nappeared since the first edition of this book.

Y., was originally supplied with water by gravity from\r\ncertain reservoirs on small streams west and north of the city. In\r\ntime, with increasing consumption, the supply obtained from these\r\nsources became inadequate, and an additional supply from the Hudson\r\nRiver was introduced. The water was obtained from the river through\r\na tunnel under the Erie Basin, and a pumping-station was erected in\r\nQuackenbush Street to pump it to reservoirs, one of which served also\r\nas the distributing point for one of the gravity supplies. The intake,\r\nwhich was used first in 1873, drew water from the river opposite the\r\nheart of the city. In recent years, the amount of water drawn from this\r\nsource has greatly exceeded that obtained from the gravity sources.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson River, at the point of intake, has a drainage area of 8240\r\nsquare miles. Of this, 4541 square miles are tributary to the Hudson\r\nabove Troy, 3493 are tributary to the Mohawk, and 168 are tributary to\r\nthe Hudson below the Mohawk.\r\n\r\nThe minimum flow may be estimated at 1657 cubic feet per second, or\r\n1,060,000,000 gallons per 24 hours, or at least fifty times the maximum\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nThe cities and larger towns upon the river above the intake, with\r\nestimated populations and distances, are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nMOST IMPORTANT CITIES, TOWNS, AND VILLAGES ON THE WATERSHED OF THE\r\nHUDSON ABOVE ALBANY.\r\n\r\n  ------------+-----------+-----------+-----------------------------\r\n              |           |Approximate|       Population in\r\n    Place.    |  County.  | Distance  +--------+-------+------------\r\n              |           |   above   | 1880.  | 1890. |   1900.\r\n              |           |  Intake,  |        |       |\r\n              |           |   Miles.  |        |       |(Estimated.)\r\n  ------------+-----------+-----------+--------+-------+------------\r\n  Troy        |Rensselaer |     4     | 56,747 | 60,956|  65,470\r\n  Watervliet  |Albany     |     4     |  8,820 | 12,967|  19,040\r\n  Green Island|Rensselaer |     5     |  4,160 |  4,463|   4,788\r\n  Cohoes      |Albany     |     8     | 19,416 | 22,509|  26,450\r\n  Lansingburg |Rensselaer |     8     |  7,432 | 10,550|  14,980\r\n  Waterford   |Saratoga   |     9     | (1,822)|  1,822|  (1,822)\r\n  Schenectady |Schenectady|    28     | 13,655 | 19,002|  26,450\r\n  Hoosic Falls|Rensselaer |    44     |  4,530 |  7,014|  10,860\r\n  Amsterdam   |Montgomery |    44     |  9,466 | 17,336|  31,730\r\n  Glens Falls |Warren     |    49     |  4,900 |  9,509|  18,450\r\n  Saratoga    |Saratoga   |    51     |  8,421 | 11,975|  17,010\r\n   Springs    |           |           |        |       |\r\n  Johnstown   |Fulton     |    56     |  5,013 |  7,768|  12,040\r\n  Gloversville|Fulton     |    58     |  7,133 | 13,864|  26,930\r\n  North Adams,|           |           |        |       |\r\n    Mass.     |Berkshire  |    68     | 10,191 | 16,074|  25,340\r\n  Adams, Mass.|Berkshire  |    75     |  5,591 |  9,213|  15,181\r\n  Little Falls|Herkimer   |    82     |  6,910 |  8,783|  11,160\r\n  Utica       |Oneida     |   107     | 33,914 | 44,007|  57,090\r\n  Rome        |Oneida     |   127     | 12,194 | 14,991|  18,430\r\n  32 villages |           |           | 52,523 | 61,869|  76,194\r\n  ------------+-----------+-----------+--------+-------+------------\r\n     Total, not including rural       |        |       |\r\n       population                     |272,838 |354,672| 479,415\r\n     Per square mile                  |     33 |     43|      59\r\n  ------------------------------------+--------+-------+------------\r\n\r\nWithout entering into a detailed discussion, it may be said that the\r\namount of sewage, with reference to the size of the river and the\r\nvolume of flow, is a fraction less than that at Lawrence, Mass.,\r\nwhere a filter-plant has also been constructed, but the pollution is\r\nmuch greater than that of most American rivers from which municipal\r\nwater-supplies are taken.\r\n\r\nThe filtration-plant completed in 1899 takes the water from a point\r\nabout two miles above the old intake. Pumps lift the water to the\r\nsedimentation-basin, from which it flows to the filters and thence\r\nthrough a conduit to the pumping-station previously used.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLANT.\r\n\r\n=Intake.=—The intake consists of a simple concrete structure in the\r\nform of a box, having an open top covered with rails 6 inches apart,\r\nand connected below, through a 36-inch pipe, with a well in the\r\npumping-station. Before going to the pumps the water passes through a\r\nscreen with bars 2 inches apart, so arranged as to be raked readily.\r\nThe rails over the intake and this screen are intended to stop matters\r\nwhich might obstruct the passageways of the pumps, but no attempt is\r\nmade to stop fish, leaves, or other floating matters which may be\r\nin the water. The arrangement, in this respect, is like that of the\r\nfilter at Lawrence, Mass., where the raw water is not subjected to\r\nclose screening. There is room, however, to place finer screens in the\r\npump-well, should they be found desirable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUDSON RIVER\r\n\r\nNEAR INTAKE\r\n\r\nFIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEDIMENTATION-BASIN, PUMPING-STATION, AND OUTLETS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEDIMENTATION-BASIN, AN OUTLET, AND LABORATORY.\r\n\r\n  [_To face page 290._]\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Pumping-station.=—The centrifugal pumps have a guaranteed capacity\r\nof 16,000,000 gallons per 24 hours against a lift of 18 feet, or\r\n12,000,000 gallons per 24 hours against a lift of 24 feet. The ordinary\r\npumping at low water is against the higher lift, and under these\r\nconditions either pump can supply the ordinary consumption, the other\r\npump being held in reserve.\r\n\r\nThe pumping-station building, to a point above the highest flood-level,\r\nis of massive concrete construction, without openings. Nearly all\r\nthe machinery is necessarily below this level, and in high water\r\nthe sluice-gates are closed, and the machinery is thus protected\r\nfrom flooding. The superstructure is of pressed brick, with granite\r\ntrimmings.\r\n\r\n=Meter for Raw Water.=—Upon leaving the pumping-station the water\r\npasses through a 36-inch Venturi meter having a throat diameter of 17\r\ninches, the throat area being two ninths of the area of the pipe. The\r\nmeter records the quantity of water pumped, and is also arranged to\r\nshow on gauges in the pumping-station the rate of pumping.\r\n\r\n=Aeration.=—After leaving the meter, the water passes to the\r\nsedimentation-basin through eleven outlets. These outlets consist of\r\n12-inch pipes on end, the tops of which are 4 feet above the nominal\r\nflow-line of the sedimentation-basin. Each of these outlet-pipes is\r\npierced with 296 3/8-inch holes extending from 0.5 to 3.5 feet below\r\nthe top of the pipe. These holes are computed so that when 11,000,000\r\ngallons of water per day are pumped all the water will pass through the\r\nholes, the water in the pipes standing flush with the tops. The water\r\nis thus thrown out in 3256 small streams, and becomes aerated. When\r\nmore than the above amount is pumped, the excess flows over the tops of\r\nthe outlet-pipes in thin sheets, which are broken by the jets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GENERAL PLAN\r\n\r\nFIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nRegarding the necessity for aeration, no observations have been taken\r\nupon the Hudson River, but, judging from experience with the Merrimac\r\nat Lawrence, where the conditions are in many respects similar, the\r\nwater is at all times more or less aerated, and, for the greater\r\npart of the year, it is nearly saturated with oxygen, and aeration\r\nis not necessary. During low water in summer, however, there is much\r\nless oxygen in the water, and at these times aeration is a distinct\r\nadvantage. Further, the river-water will often have a slight odor, and\r\naeration will tend to remove it. The outlets are arranged so that they\r\ncan be removed readily in winter if they are not found necessary at\r\nthat season.\r\n\r\n=Sedimentation-basin.=—The sedimentation-basin has an area of 5 acres\r\nand is 9 feet deep. To the overflow it has a capacity of 14,600,000\r\ngallons, and to the flow-line of the filters 8,900,000 gallons.\r\nThere is thus a reserve capacity of 5,700,000 gallons between these\r\nlimits, and this amount can be drawn upon, without inconvenience, for\r\nmaintaining the filters in service while the pumps are shut down. This\r\nallows a freedom in the operation of the pumps which would not exist\r\nwith the water supplied direct to the filters.\r\n\r\nThe water enters the sedimentation-basin from eleven inlets along\r\none side, and is withdrawn from eleven outlets directly opposite.\r\nThe inlets and aerating devices described previously bring the water\r\ninto the basin without current and evenly distributed along one\r\nside. Both inlets and outlets are controlled by gates, so that any\r\nirregularities in distribution can be avoided. The concrete floor of\r\nthe sedimentation-basin is built with even slopes from the toe of each\r\nembankment to a sump, the heights of these slopes being 1 foot,\r\nwhatever their lengths. The sump is connected with a 24-inch pipe\r\nleading to a large manhole in which there is a gate through which water\r\ncan be drawn to empty the basin. There is an overflow from the basin\r\nto this manhole which makes it impossible to fill the basin above the\r\nintended level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONGITUDINAL SECTION ON _a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h_\r\n\r\nFILTER BEDS\r\n\r\nPLAN AND SECTION OF FILTER NO. 2\r\n\r\nFIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUTSIDE WALL, READY FOR CONCRETE BACKING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEDIMENTATION-BASIN: SHOWING CONSTRUCTION OF FLOOR.\r\n\r\n  [_To face page 294._]\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Filters.=—The filters are of masonry, and are covered to protect them\r\nagainst the winters, which are quite severe in Albany. The piers,\r\ncross-walls, and linings of the outside walls, entrances, etc., are of\r\nvitrified brick. All other masonry is concrete. The average depth of\r\nexcavation for the filters was 4 feet, and the material at the bottom\r\nwas usually blue or yellow clay. In some places shale was encountered.\r\nIn one place soft clay was found, and there the foundations were made\r\ndeeper. The floors consisted of inverted, groined, concrete arches,\r\narranged to distribute the weight of the walls and vaulting over the\r\nwhole area of the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe groined arch-vaulting is of concrete with a clear span of 11 feet\r\n11 inches, a rise of 2-1/2 feet, and a thickness of 6 inches at the\r\ncrown. It was put in in squares, the joints being on the crowns of the\r\narches parallel with the lines of the piers, and each pier being the\r\ncentre of one square. The manholes are in alternate sections, and are\r\nof concrete, built in steel forms with castings at the tops, securely\r\njointed to the concrete.\r\n\r\nAbove the vaulting there are 2 feet of earth and soil, grassed on\r\ntop. The tops of the manholes are 6 inches above the soil to prevent\r\nrain-water from entering them. The drainage of the soil is effected\r\nby a depression of the vaulting over each pier, partially filled with\r\ngravel and sand, from which water is removed by a 2-inch tile-drain\r\ngoing down the centre of the pier and discharging through its side just\r\nabove the top of the sand in the filter.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide ready access to each filter, a part of the vaulting\r\nnear one side is elevated and made cylindrical in shape, making an\r\ninclined runway from the sand-level to a door the threshold of which is\r\n6 inches above the level of the overflow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FILTER BEDS\r\n\r\n  SECTION OF FILTERS\r\n\r\nFIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nThis sand-run is provided with permanent timber runways and with secure\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section.\r\n\r\nElevation.\r\n\r\nFIG. 5.—ENTRANCE TO A FILTER.]\r\n\r\nThe manholes of the filters are provided with double covers of steel\r\nplates to exclude the cold. The covers also exclude light. When\r\ncleaning the filters, light can be admitted by removing the covers.\r\nSupports for electric lights are placed in the vaulting, so that the\r\nfilters can be lighted by electricity and the work of cleaning can be\r\ndone at night, and in winter under heavy snow, without removing the\r\ncovers. The electric lights have not yet been installed.\r\n\r\nThe regulator-houses, the entrances to the sand-runs, and all exposed\r\nwork are of pressed brick with Milford granite trimmings and slate\r\nroofs. The regulator-houses have double walls and double windows and\r\na tight ceiling in the roof, to make them as warm as possible and to\r\navoid the necessity of artificial heat to prevent freezing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPUTED FRICTIONAL RESISTANCE OF DRAINAGE SYSTEM OF\r\nONE FILTER WHEN OPERATING AT A RATE OF 100 M.M.

They were laid with a\r\nspace of about 1 inch between the barrels, leaving a large opening for\r\nthe admission of water from the gravel.\r\n\r\nThe underdrainage system is so designed that, when starting a filter\r\nafter cleaning, the friction of the sand is about 50 mm. at a rate of\r\n3,000,000 gallons per acre daily, and the friction of the underdrainage\r\nsystem is estimated at 10 mm. This very low friction, which is\r\nnecessary, is obtained by the use of ample sizes for the underdrains\r\nand low velocities in them. In the outlet and measuring devices\r\nmoderate losses of head are not objectionable, and the sizes of the\r\npipes and connections are, therefore, smaller than the main underdrains.\r\n\r\nThe gravel surrounding the underdrains is of three grades. The material\r\nwas obtained from the river-bed by dredging, and was of the same stock\r\nas that used for preparing ballast for the concrete. It was separated\r\nand cleaned by a special, cylindrical, revolving screen. The coarsest\r\ngrade of gravel was that which would not pass round holes 1 inch in\r\ndiameter, and free from stones more than about 2 inches in diameter. At\r\nfirst it was required to pass a screen with holes 2 inches in diameter,\r\nbut this screen removed many stones which it was desired to retain, and\r\nthe screen was afterward changed to have holes 3 inches in diameter.\r\nThe intermediate grades of gravel passed the 1-inch holes, and were\r\nretained by a screen with round holes 3/8 inch in diameter. The finest\r\ngravel passed the above screens and was retained by a screen with\r\nround holes 3/16 inch in diameter. The gravel was washed, until free\r\nfrom sand and dirt, by water played upon it during the process of\r\nscreening, and it was afterward taken over screens in the chutes, where\r\nit was separated from the dirty water, and, when necessary, further\r\nquantities of water were played upon it at these points.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INLET TO FILTER BED.

Their effective sizes were 23, 8, and 3 mm. respectively,\r\nand for convenience they are designated by these numbers. The average\r\nuniformity coefficient for each grade was about 1.8.\r\n\r\nThe 23-mm. gravel entirely surrounded the 6-inch pipe-drains, and was\r\ncarried slightly above their tops. In some cases it was used to cover\r\nnearly the whole of the floor, but this was not insisted upon.\r\n\r\nThe 8-mm. gravel was obtained in larger quantity than the other sizes,\r\nand was used to fill all spaces up to a plane 2-1/2 inches below the\r\nfinished surface of the gravel, this layer being about 2 inches thick\r\nover the tops of the drains, and somewhat thicker elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe 3-mm. gravel was then applied in a layer 2-1/2 inches deep, and the\r\nsurface levelled.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary estimates of cost were based upon the use of\r\nfilter-sand from a bank near the filter-site. Further examination\r\nshowed that this sand contained a considerable quantity of lime, and\r\nit was found by experiment with a small filter constructed for that\r\npurpose that the use of this sand would harden the water by about 2\r\nparts in 100,000, and the amount of lime contained in the sand, namely,\r\nabout 7 per cent, was sufficient to continue this hardening action\r\nfor a considerable number of years. This was regarded as a serious\r\nobjection to its use, and the specifications were drawn limiting the\r\namount of lime in the sand. This excluded all of the local bank sands.\r\nThe river-sands which were used were nearly free from lime, and in the\r\nend the sand as secured was probably not only free from lime, but more\r\nsatisfactory in other ways, and also cheaper than the bank-sand would\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MECHANICAL COMPOSITION OF FILTER SAND AND GRAVELS.\r\n\r\n(ARROWS SHOW REQUIREMENT OF SPECIFICATION)\r\n\r\n_Diameters in Millimeters_\r\n\r\nFIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nThe specifications of the filter-sand require that “The filter-sand\r\nshall be clean river-, beach-, or bank-sand, with either sharp or\r\nrounded grains. It shall be entirely free from clay, dust, or organic\r\nimpurities, and shall, if necessary, be washed to remove such materials\r\nfrom it. The grains shall, all of them, be of hard material which will\r\nnot disintegrate, and shall be of the following diameters: Not more\r\nthan 1 per cent, by weight, less than 0.13 mm., nor more than 10 per\r\ncent less than 0.27 mm.; at least 10 per cent, by weight, shall be\r\nless than 0.36 mm., and at least 70 per cent, by weight, shall be less\r\nthan 1 mm., and no particles shall be more than 5 mm. in diameter.\r\nThe diameters of the sand-grains will be computed as the diameters of\r\nspheres of equal volume. The sand shall not contain more than 2 per\r\ncent, by weight, of lime and magnesia taken together and calculated as\r\ncarbonates.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLACING THE CONCRETE VAULTING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW OF VAULTING, UNDER CONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n  [_To face page 302._]\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe sand was obtained from the river at various places by dredging.\r\nIt was first taken up by dipper-dredges, and brought in scows to a\r\npoint in the back channel a little north of the filter-plant. It was\r\nthere dumped in a specially prepared place in the bottom of the river,\r\nfrom which it was lifted by a hydraulic dredge and pumped through a\r\n15-inch pipe an average distance of 525 feet to points selected, and\r\nvaried from time to time, on the flats north of the filters. The water\r\ncontaining the sand was then put through screens having meshes which\r\nexcluded all stones 5 mm. in diameter and over, and was then taken into\r\nbasins where the sand was deposited and afterward carted to the filters.\r\n\r\nTwo ejector sand-washing machines, shown in Fig. 9, are provided at\r\nconvenient places between the filters. In them the dirty sand is mixed\r\nwith water, and is thrown up by an ejector, after which it runs through\r\na chute into a receptacle, from which it is again lifted by another\r\nejector. It passes in all through five ejectors, part of the dirty\r\nwater being wasted each time. The sand is finally collected from the\r\nlast ejector, where it is allowed to deposit from the water.\r\n\r\nWater is admitted to each filter through a 20-inch pipe from a pipe\r\nsystem connecting with the sedimentation-basin. Just inside of the\r\nfilter-wall is placed a standard gate, and beyond that a balanced\r\nvalve connected with an adjustable float to shut off the water when\r\nit reaches the desired height on the filter. These valves and floats\r\nwere constructed from special designs, and are similar in principle to\r\nvalves used for the same purpose in the Berlin water-filters.\r\n\r\nEach filter is provided with an overflow, so arranged that it cannot be\r\nclosed, which prevents the water-level from exceeding a fixed limit in\r\ncase the balanced valve fails to act. An outlet is also provided near\r\nthe sand-run, so that unfiltered water can be removed quickly from the\r\nsurface of the filter, should it be necessary, to facilitate cleaning.\r\n\r\nThe outlet of each filter is through a 20-inch gate controlled by a\r\nstandard graduated to show the exact distance the gate is open. The\r\nwater rises in a chamber and flows through an orifice in a brass plate\r\n4 by 24 inches, the centre of which is 1 foot below the level of the\r\nsand-line. At the nominal rate of filtration, 3,000,000 gallons per\r\nacre daily, 1 foot of head is required to force the water through the\r\norifice. With other rates the head increases or decreases approximately\r\nas the square of the rate and forms a measure of it. With water\r\nstanding in the lower chamber, so that the orifice is submerged, it is\r\nassumed that the same rates will be obtained with a given difference\r\nin level between the water on the two sides of the orifice as from an\r\nequal head above the centre of the orifice when discharging into air.\r\n\r\n=Measurement of Effluent.=—In order to show the rate of filtration two\r\nfloats are connected with the water on the two sides of the orifice.\r\nThese floats are counterbalanced; one carries a graduated scale, and\r\nthe other a marker which moves in front of the scale and shows the rate\r\nof filtration corresponding to the difference in level of the water\r\non the two sides. When the water in the lower chamber falls below the\r\ncentre of the orifice, the water in the float-chamber is nevertheless\r\nmaintained at this level. This is accomplished by making the lower part\r\nof the tube water-tight, with openings just at the desired level, so\r\nthat when the water falls below this point in the outer chamber it does\r\nnot fall in the float-chamber.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the loss of water in the float-chamber by evaporation or\r\nfrom other causes, a lead pipe is brought from the other chamber and\r\nsupplies a driblet of water to it constantly; this overflows through\r\nthe openings, and maintains the water-level at precisely the desired\r\npoint. The floats thus indicate the difference in water-level on the\r\ntwo sides of the orifice whenever the water in the lower chamber is\r\nabove the centre of the orifice; otherwise they indicate the height of\r\nwater in the upper chamber above the centre of the orifice, regardless\r\nof the water-level in the lower chamber. The scale is graduated to show\r\nthe rates of filtration in millions of gallons per acre of filtering\r\narea. In computing this scale the area of the filters is taken as 0.7\r\nacre, and the coefficient of discharge as 0.61.\r\n\r\nAt the ordinary rates of filtration the errors introduced by the\r\ndifferent conditions under which the orifice operates will rarely\r\namount to as much as 100,000 gallons per acre daily, or one thirtieth\r\nof the ordinary rate of filtration. Usually they are much less than\r\nthis. The apparatus thus shows directly, and with substantial accuracy,\r\nthe rate of filtration under all conditions.\r\n\r\n=Measurement of Loss of Head.=—Two other floats with similar\r\nconnections show the difference in level between the water standing on\r\nthe filter and the water in the main drain-pipe back of the gate, or,\r\nin other words, the frictional resistance of the filter, including the\r\ndrains. This is commonly called the loss of head, and increases from\r\n0.2 foot or less, with a perfectly clean filter, to 4 feet with the\r\nfilter ready for cleaning. When the loss of head exceeds 4 feet the\r\nrate of filtration cannot be maintained at 3,000,000 gallons per acre\r\ndaily with the outlet devices provided, and, in order to maintain the\r\nrate, the filter must be cleaned.\r\n\r\n=Adjustment of Gauges.=—The adjustment of the gauges showing the rate\r\nof filtration and loss of head is extremely simple. When a filter is\r\nput in service the gates from the lower chamber to the pure-water\r\nreservoir and to the drain are closed, the outlet of the filter opened,\r\nand both chambers allowed to fill to the level of the water on the\r\nfilter. The length of the wire carrying the gauge is then adjusted so\r\nthat the gauge will make the desired run without hitting at either end,\r\nand then the marker is adjusted. As both the rate of filtration and\r\nloss of head are zero under these conditions, it is only necessary to\r\nset the markers to read zero on the gauges to adjust them. The gates\r\ncan then be opened for regular operation, and the readings on the\r\ngauges will be correct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF A FILTER: DRAIN, GRAVEL AND SAND LAYERS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF A FILTER, READY FOR USE.\r\n\r\n  [_To face page 306._]\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to use wires which are light, flexible, and which will\r\nnot stretch. At first piano-wire, No. 27 B. & S. gauge, was used, and\r\nwas well adapted to the purpose, except that it rusted rapidly. Because\r\nof the rusting it was found necessary to substitute another wire,\r\nand cold-drawn copper wire, No. 24 B. & S. gauge, was used with fair\r\nresults. Stretching is less serious than it would otherwise be, as the\r\ncorrectness of the adjustment can be observed and corrected readily\r\nevery time a filter is out of service.\r\n\r\nFrom the lower chambers in the regulator-houses the water flows\r\nthrough gates to the pipe system leading to the pure-water reservoir.\r\nDrain-pipes are also provided which allow the water to be entirely\r\ndrawn out of each filter, should that be necessary for any reason,\r\nand without interfering with the other filters or with the pure-water\r\nreservoir.\r\n\r\nThe outlets of the filters are connected in pairs, so that filtered\r\nwater can be used for filling the underdrains and sand of the filters\r\nfrom below prior to starting, thus avoiding the disturbance which\r\nresults from bringing dirty water upon the sand of a filter not filled\r\nwith water.\r\n\r\n=Laboratory Building.=—The scientific control of filters is regarded\r\nas one of the essentials to the best results, and to provide for this\r\nthere is a laboratory building at one end of the central court between\r\nthe filters and close to the sedimentation-basin, supplied with the\r\nnecessary equipment for full bacterial examinations, and also with\r\nfacilities for observing the colors and turbidities of raw and filtered\r\nwaters, and for making such chemical examinations as may be necessary.\r\nThis building also provides a comfortable office, dark room, and\r\nstorage room for tools, etc., used in the work.\r\n\r\n=Pure-water Reservoir.=—A small pure-water reservoir, 94 feet square\r\nand holding about 600,000 gallons, is provided at the filter-plant. The\r\nconstruction is similar to that of the filters, but the shapes of the\r\npiers and vaulting were changed slightly, as there was no necessity for\r\nthe ledges about the bottoms of the piers and walls; while provision\r\nis made for taking the rain-water, falling upon the vaulting above, to\r\nthe nearest filters instead of allowing it to enter the reservoir. The\r\nfloor and roof of the reservoir are at the same levels as those of the\r\nfilters.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPACITY OF PLANT AND MEANS OF REGULATION.\r\n\r\nThe various filters have effective filtering areas of from 0.702 to\r\n0.704 acre, depending upon slight differences in the thickness of the\r\nwalls in different places. For the purpose of computation, the area of\r\neach filter is taken at 0.7 acre. The nominal rate of filtration is\r\ntaken as 3,000,000 gallons per acre daily, at which rate each filter\r\nwill yield 2,100,000 gallons daily, and, with one filter out of use\r\nfor the purpose of being cleaned, seven filters normally in use will\r\nyield 14,700,000 gallons. The entrances and outlets are all made of\r\nsufficient size, so that rates 50 per cent greater than the foregoing\r\nare possible. The capacities of the intake, pumping-station, and piping\r\nare such as to supply any quantity of water which the filters can\r\ntake, up to an extreme maximum of 25,000,000 gallons in 24 hours. The\r\npure-water conduit from the filters to Quackenbush Street is nominally\r\nrated at 25,000,000 gallons per 24 hours, after it has become old and\r\nsomewhat tuberculated. In its present excellent condition it will carry\r\na larger quantity,\r\n\r\nAt the pumping-station at Quackenbush Street there are three Allis\r\npumps, each capable of pumping 5,000,000 gallons per 24 hours. In\r\naddition to the above there are the old reserve pumps with a nominal\r\ncapacity of 10,000,000 gallons per 24 hours, which can be used if\r\nnecessary, but which require so much coal that they are seldom used.\r\nFor practical purposes the 15,000,000 gallons represents the pumping\r\ncapacity of this station and also the capacity of the filters, but\r\nthe arrangements are such that in case of emergency the supply can be\r\nincreased to 20,000,000 or even 25,000,000 gallons for a short time.\r\n\r\nThe water is pumped through rising mains to reservoirs holding\r\n37,000,000 gallons, not including the Tivoli low-service reservoir,\r\nwhich is usually supplied from gravity sources. The reservoir capacity\r\nis such that the pumping can be suspended at Quackenbush Street\r\nfor considerable periods if necessary, and in practice it has been\r\nsuspended at certain times, especially on Sundays. The amount of water\r\nrequired is also somewhat irregular. The drainage areas supplying the\r\ngravity reservoirs are much larger, relatively, than the reservoirs,\r\nand at flood periods the volume of the gravity supply is much greater\r\nthan that which can be drawn in dry weather. Thus it happens that, at\r\ncertain seasons of the year, the amount of water to be pumped is but a\r\nfraction of the nominal capacity of the pumps, and at these times it is\r\npossible to shut the pumps down for greater lengths of time.\r\n\r\n=Capacity of Pure-water Reservoir.=—The storage capacity provided\r\nbetween the filters and the Quackenbush Street pumps is comparatively\r\nsmall, namely, 600,000 gallons, or one hour’s supply at the full\r\nnominal rate. A larger basin, holding as much as one third or one\r\nhalf of a day’s supply, would be in many respects desirable in this\r\nposition, but the conditions were such as to make it practically\r\nimpossible. The bottom of the reservoir could not be put lower without\r\ndeepening and increasing greatly the expense of the conduit-line. On\r\nthe other hand, the flow-line of the reservoir could not be raised\r\nwithout raising the level of the filters, which was hardly possible\r\nupon the site selected. The available depth of the reservoir was thus\r\nlimited between very narrow bounds, and to secure a large capacity\r\nwould have necessitated a very large area, and consequently a great\r\nexpense. Under these circumstances, and especially in view of the\r\nabundant storage capacity for filtered water in the distributing\r\nreservoirs, it was not deemed necessary to provide a large storage, and\r\nonly so much was provided as would allow the pumps to be started at\r\nthe convenience of the engineer, and give a reasonable length of time\r\nfor the filters to be brought into operation. For this the pure-water\r\nreservoir is ample, but it is not enough to balance any continued\r\nfluctuations in the rate of pumping.\r\n\r\n=Method of Regulating and Changing the Rate of Filtration.=—With\r\nall the Allis pumps running at their nominal capacity, the quantity\r\nof water required will just about equal the nominal capacity of the\r\nfilters. When only one or two pumps are running, the rate of filtration\r\ncan be reduced. With the plant operating up to its full capacity, the\r\nwater-level in the pure-water reservoir will be below the level of\r\nthe standard orifices in the filter outlets. When the rate of pumping\r\nis reduced, if no change is made in the gates controlling the filter\r\noutlets, the water will gradually rise in the pure-water reservoir and\r\nin the various regulator chambers, and will submerge the orifices and\r\ngradually reduce the head on the filters, and consequently the rates\r\nof filtration, until those rates equal the quantity pumped. In case\r\nthe pumping is stopped altogether, the filters will keep on delivering\r\nat gradually reduced rates until the water-level in the pure-water\r\nreservoir reaches that of the water on the filters.\r\n\r\nWhen the pumps are started up, after such stoppage or reduced rate\r\nof pumping, the water-levels in the pure-water reservoir and in the\r\ngate-chambers will be lowered gradually, and the filters will start\r\nto operate it first with extremely low rates, which will increase\r\ngradually until the water is depressed below the orifices, when they\r\nwill again reach the rates at which they were last set. The regulators\r\nduring all this time will show the rate of filtration on each filter,\r\nand, if any inequalities occur which demand correction, the gates on\r\nthe various outlets can be adjusted accordingly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CENTRAL COURT, SHOWING SAND-WASHER, DIRTY SAND, ETC.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEDIMENTATION BASIN, FILTERS, ETC.\r\n\r\n  [_To face page 310._]\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe arrangement, in this respect, combines some of the features of\r\nthe English and German plants. In the English plants the filters are\r\nusually connected directly with the clear-water basin, and that in turn\r\nwith the pumps, and the speed of filtration is required to respond\r\nto the speed of the pumps, increasing and decreasing with it, being\r\nregulated at all times by the height of water in the pure-water\r\nreservoir. This arrangement has been subject to severe criticism,\r\nbecause the rate of filtration fluctuates with the consumption, and\r\nespecially because the rates of filtration obtained simultaneously in\r\ndifferent filters may be different. There was no way to determine at\r\nwhat rate any individual filter was working, and there was always a\r\ntendency for a freshly scraped filter to operate much more rapidly than\r\nthose which had not been scraped for some time.\r\n\r\nThis led to the procedure, first formulated by the Commission of German\r\nWater-works Engineers in 1894, and provided for in most of the German\r\nworks built or remodelled since that time, of providing pure-water\r\nstorage sufficient in amount to make the rate of filtration entirely\r\nindependent of the operation of the pumps. Each filter was to be\r\ncontrolled by itself, be independent of the others, and deliver its\r\nwater into a pure-water reservoir lower than itself, so that it could\r\nnever be affected by back-water, and so large that there would never be\r\na demand for sudden changes in the rate of filtration.\r\n\r\nThis procedure has given excellent results in the German works; but\r\nit leads oftentimes to expensive construction. It involves, in the\r\nfirst place, a much greater loss of head in passing through the works,\r\nbecause the pure-water reservoir must be lower than the filters, and\r\nthe cost of the pure-water reservoir is increased greatly because\r\nof its large size. The regulation of the filters is put upon the\r\nattendants entirely, or upon automatic devices, and regulation by what\r\nis known as “responding to the pumps” is eliminated.\r\n\r\nMore recently, the German authorities have shown less disposition to\r\ninsist rigidly upon the principles advanced in 1894. In a compilation\r\nof the results of several years’ experience with German water-filters,\r\nDr. Pannwiz[66] makes a statement of particular interest, of which a\r\nfree translation is as follows:\r\n\r\n“Most of the German works have sufficient pure-water reservoir capacity\r\nto balance the normal fluctuations in consumption,\r\n\r\nso that the rate of filtration is at least independent of the hourly\r\nfluctuations in consumption. Of especial importance is the superficial\r\narea of the pure-water reservoir. If it is sufficiently large, there is\r\nno objection to allowing the water-level in it to rise to that of the\r\nwater upon the filters. With very low rates of consumption during the\r\nnight the filters may work slowly and even stop, without damage to the\r\nsediment layers when the stopping and starting take place slowly and\r\nregularly, because of the ample reservoir area.”\r\n\r\n“The very considerable fluctuations from day to day, especially those\r\narising from unusual and unforeseen occurrences, are not provided for\r\nentirely by even very large and well-arranged reservoirs. To provide\r\nfor these without causing shock, the rate of filtration must be changed\r\ncarefully and gradually, and the first essential to success is a good\r\nregulation apparatus.”\r\n\r\n“Responding to the pumps” has a great deal to recommend it. It allows\r\nthe pure-water reservoir to be put at the highest possible level, it\r\nreduces to a minimum the loss of head in the plant, and yet provides\r\nautomatically, and without the slightest trouble on the part of the\r\nattendants, for the delivery of the required quantity of water by the\r\nfilters at all times. If the filters are connected directly to the\r\npumps there is a tendency for the pulsations of the pumps to disturb\r\ntheir operation, which is highly objectionable, even if the pumps are\r\nfar removed; and this exists where filters are connected directly to\r\nthe pumps, and a pure-water reservoir is attached to them indirectly.\r\nBy taking all the water through the pure-water reservoir and having no\r\nconnection except through it, this condition is absolutely avoided, and\r\nthe pull on the filters is at all times perfectly steady.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said as to the effect of variation in the rate of\r\nfiltration upon the efficiency of filters. Experiments have been made\r\nat Lawrence and elsewhere which have shown that, as long as the maximum\r\nrate does not exceed a proper one, and under reasonable regulations,\r\nand with the filter in all respects in good order, no marked decrease\r\nin efficiency results from moderate fluctuations in rate. There is\r\nprobably a greater decrease in efficiency by stopping the filter\r\naltogether, especially if it is done suddenly, than by simply reducing\r\nthe rate. The former sometimes results in loosening air-bubbles in the\r\nsand, which rise to the surface and cause disturbances, but this is not\r\noften caused by simple change in rate.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, there is little evidence to show that, within reasonable\r\nlimits, fluctuations in rate are objectionable, or should be excluded\r\nentirely, especially in such cases as at Albany, where arrangements to\r\nprevent them would have resulted in very greatly increased first cost.\r\nThe inferior results sometimes obtained with the system of “responding\r\nto the pumps” as it existed in earlier works, and still exists in many\r\nimportant places, undoubtedly arises from the fact that there is no\r\nmeans of knowing and controlling the simultaneous rate of filtration in\r\ndifferent filters, and that one filter may be filtering two or three\r\ntimes as fast as another, with nothing to indicate it.\r\n\r\nThis contingency is fully provided for in the Albany plant. The\r\norifices are of such size that even with a filter just scraped and\r\nput in service, with the minimum loss of head, with the outlet-gate\r\nwide open, and with the water-level in the pure-water reservoir clear\r\ndown—that is, with the most unfavorable conditions which could possibly\r\nexist—the rate of filtration cannot exceed 5,000,000 or 6,000,000\r\ngallons per acre daily, or double the nominal rate. This rate, while\r\nmuch too high for a filter which has just been cleaned, is not nearly\r\nas high as was possible, and in fact actually occurred in the old\r\nStralau filters at Berlin, and in many English works; and, further,\r\nsuch a condition could only occur through the gross negligence of\r\nthe attendants, because the rate of filtration is indicated clearly\r\nat all times by the gauges. These regulating-devices have been\r\nspecially designed to show the rate with unmistakable clearness, so\r\nthat no attendant, however stupid, can make an error by an incorrect\r\ncomputation from the gauge heights. It is believed that the advantage\r\nof clearness by this procedure is much more important than any\r\nincreased accuracy which might be secured by refinements in the method\r\nof computation, which should take into account variations in the value\r\nof the coefficient of discharge, but which would render direct readings\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nIn designing the Albany plant the object has been to combine the best\r\nfeatures of German regulation with the economical and convenient\r\nfeatures of the older English system, and filters are allowed to\r\nrespond to the pumps within certain limits, while guarding against the\r\ndangers ordinarily incident thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF OPERATION.\r\n\r\nThe filters were designed to remove from the water the bacteria which\r\ncause disease. They have already reached a bacterial efficiency of over\r\n99 per cent, and it is expected that their use will result in a great\r\nreduction in the death-rate from water-borne diseases in the city. They\r\nalso remove a part of the color and all of the suspended matters and\r\nturbidity, so that the water is satisfactory in its physical properties.\r\n\r\nThe filters have reached with perfect ease their rated capacity, and\r\non several occasions have been operated to deliver one third more than\r\nthis amount; that is to say, at a rate of 4,000,000 gallons per acre,\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST OF CONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nThe approximate cost of the filtration-plant complete was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Land                                                 $8,290\r\n  Pumping-station and intake                           49,745\r\n  Filters and sedimentation-basin, with piping        323,960\r\n  Pure-water conduit and connection with Quackenbush\r\n    Street pumping-station                             86,638\r\n  Engineering and minor expenses                       28,000\r\n                                                     ————————\r\n        Total                                        $496,633\r\n\r\nThe filters, sedimentation-basin, and pure-water reservoir are\r\nconnected in such a way as to make an exact separation of their\r\ncosts impossible; but, approximately, the sedimentation-basin cost\r\n$60,000, the pure-water reservoir $9,000, and the filters $255,000.\r\nThe sedimentation-basin thus cost $4,100 per million gallons capacity;\r\nand the filters complete cost $45,600 per acre of net filtering area,\r\nincluding all piping, office and laboratory building, but exclusive of\r\nland and engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENT.\r\n\r\nThe general plan and location of the plant were first conceived by the\r\nSuperintendent of Water-works, George I. Bailey, M. Am. Soc. C. E., and\r\nthe successful execution is largely due to his efforts. The members\r\nof the Water Board, and especially the Construction Committee, have\r\nfollowed the work in detail closely and personally, and their interest\r\nand support have been essential factors in the results accomplished. In\r\nthe designs and specifications for the pure-water conduit the author\r\nis greatly indebted to Emil Kuichling, M. Am. Soc. C. E., and also for\r\nmost valuable suggestions relative to the performance of this part of\r\nthe work. To William Wheeler, M. Am. Soc. C. E., of Boston, the author\r\nis indebted for advice upon the vaulting and cross-sections of the\r\nwalls, and these matters were submitted to him before the plans were\r\nput in final shape. All the architectural designs have been supplied\r\nby Mr. A. W. Fuller, of Albany. W. B. Fuller, M. Am. Soc. C. E., as\r\nResident Engineer, has been in direct charge of the work, and its\r\nsuccess is largely due to his interest in it and the close attention\r\nwhich he and the assistant engineers have given it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The American gallon is 231 cubic inches or 0.8333 of the imperial\r\ngallon.

Fuller afterward made at the Lawrence\r\nExperiment Station some further investigation of fæces from healthy\r\npeople in which the numbers were considerably lower, usually less than\r\n200,000,000, per gram and sometimes as low as 10,000,000 per gram.\r\n\r\n[48] These experiments, so far as they have come to the notice of the\r\nauthor, have been made with water sterilized by heating, usually in\r\nsmall tubes stoppered with cotton-wool or other organic matter.

Owing to defective construction of the outlets for the\r\nsedimentation-basins they have failed to act properly in presence of\r\nexcessive quantities of ice, and the sediment from the basins has been\r\ndischarged in large quantity upon the filters, and a small fraction of\r\nthe many millions of bacteria in it have passed through the filters. He\r\nhas experimented with this sediment applied to small filters, and has\r\nbecome convinced that to secure good work under all conditions a much\r\ndeeper layer of sand than that generally considered necessary must be\r\nused, and his work emphasizes the importance of the action of the sand\r\nin distinction from the action of the sediment layer, which has often\r\nbeen thought to be the sole, or at least the principal, requirement of\r\ngood filtration.\r\n\r\n[64] Licht- u.
